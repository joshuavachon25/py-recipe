PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION 

In the preparation of this edition it has been 
possible to test and revise many of the recipes. 
All have been made in quantity to serve either 
fifty or one hundred and fifty portions and many 
new recipes have been added. 

The most important feature of the book is the 
addition of the caloric value of each recipe and of 
a single serving of the recipe. The figures taken 
are usually for the raw foods, which in many cases 
are much higher than those of the cooked foods. 
It is obvious that many factors combine to make 
the calculations of the nutritive value of cooked 
foods exceedingly difficult and in many instances 
the results given must be considered as only ap- 
proximate. This information should be a great 
help to the busy dietitian who has little time for 
computing food values and yet wishes to serve 
a balanced menu and to know that the family 
is being sufficiently nourished. After planning 
a menu the adequacy of the combination may 
be determined by adding the protein calories and 
the total calories in the different dishes selected 
and comparing the result with the standard 
requirements for the special group of persons 
who are to be served. The fuel value of the 



protein in the diet, as represented by the protein 
calories, should be from ten to fifteen per cent of 
the total fuel value. 

The chapters on the "Organization of the School 
Luncheon" and "Equipment" have been omitted 
from this edition and are revised and incorporated 
in another book entitled "The School Lunch." The 
problems of organization, equipment and manage- 
ment of the school lunch may be considered in 
greater detail in a book apart from the recipes. 

The paragraph on "Flour Substitutes" was fur- 
nished by Miss Alice Wright Penrose, of the 
Ballard School, Central Branch Y. W. C. A., New 
York City. 

The author wishes to express her appreciation 
of the valuable work of several of the dietitians 
in the Philadelphia School Luncheon System in 
the calculation of the caloric values of the recipes 
and in the general revision of the book.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION 

The increasing demand for Institution Recipes 
has necessitated the preparation of a new and 
enlarged edition. 

To meet this need the work has been thor- 
oughly revised and many new recipes have been 
added. Every recipe indicates the number of 
portions it will serve; some are intended for fifty 
portions, others for one hundred, and many are 
in quantities to serve one hundred and fifty por- 
tions. By simply multiplying or dividing, a cook 
may in a few moments adapt any recipe to suit 
the size of her family, whether it is fifty, seventy- 
five or one or two hundred. It is not advisable to 
adapt these recipes to the needs of the small 
family; it is much safer to use a cook book 
intended for family use; "The Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book," by Miss F. M. Farmer; "The 
Fireless Cook Book," by Miss M. J. Mitchell, or 
some similar work. 

An important addition is the introduction of 
chapters on the administration, equipment and 
menus of the high school luncheon system as car- 
ried on in Philadelphia. Also suggestions con- 
cerning the institution kitchen equipment. 

It is the earnest wish of the author that this 
book may be found helpful in answering some of 



the questions which are puzzling many persons 
who are called upon to solve problems similar to 
those which she has had to meet. 

The valuable assistance rendered by Miss L. M. 
Armstrong in the preparation of this edition is 
hereby gratefully acknowledged. 

Thanks are extended to Miss M. J. Osborn, 
whose co-operation has made possible the success 
of our school luncheon system.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 

In preparing this book the aim has been to sup- 
ply the growing need for a collection of recipes 
for use in schools, hospitals, and other institu- 
tions. 

The recipes here offered are the result of per- 
sonal laboratory experiments and practical appli- 
cation in the preparation of food, by groups of 
students in some departments of the Johns Hop- 
kins Hospital Training School, Baltimore, and the 
lunch room for students of the Drexel Institute, 
Philadelphia. 

This collection is in no sense a complete cook 
book, but is simply the well tried recipes in actual 
daily use. With a few exceptions, these quanti- 
ties will serve one hundred and fifty persons. It 
is my earnest wish that this book may be helpful 
as a guide in preparing a variety of palatable and 
wholesome dishes in institutions. 

I desire here to thank Miss M. A. Nutting, 
Superintendent of the Nurses' Training School, 
Johns Hopkins Hospital; Miss H. M. Spring, 
Director of Domestic Science, Drexel Institute, 
and those of my co-workers to whom I am 
indebted for advice and assistance in the prepara- 
tion of this little book.

FOREWORD TO FIRST EDITION 

The writer of this manual has asked me to state 
that it is the outcome of work done in the Prepara- 
tory Department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital 
Training School. The daily work of the Nurses' 
Home is here utilized for purposes of instruction 
in the main principles of household economics, 
especial attention being given to foods and their 
preparation. This work is done by the students, 
under the direct supervision of trained and expert 
instructors, and the result has been from every 
point of view satisfactory. The students have 
received an excellent training in departments of 
work hitherto unknown; the preparation and 
serving of food has shown a marked improvement 
upon previous methods; the cost per capita has 
been distinctly lessened, and the health of the 
students generally is much better. It is clear that 
expert supervision is as necessary for good results 
in the domestic department as in any other part of 
an institution.

MEASURES AND WEIGHTS 

In the preparation of food definite measure- 
ments are absolutely necessary, in order to insure 
uniform results. Accurate scales, which indicate 
the weight down to the fraction of an ounce, are 
therefore a necessity in every kitchen. The dial 
scale, having capacity of five pounds, is a con- 
venient style. In addition toi this small scale there 
should be provided a counter platform scale having 
250 lb. capacity, to be used when receiving meats 
and other provisions. 

Measurements by weight are the most accurate, 
but for convenience, a measuring cup holding one- 
half pint, and teaspoons and tablespoons of regu- 
lation size are frequently used. 

To measure a cupful, fill the cup lightly, round 
slightly, and level with a case-knife. To measure 
teaspoonfuls and tablespoonfuls, dip the spoon in 
the ingredient, fill, and with a case-knife scrape off 
level with the edge of the spoon. Divide length- 
wise of the spoon with a knife for a half -spoonful ; 
divide halves crosswise for quarters, and quarters 
crosswise for eighths. Flour, powdered sugar,

baking powder, spices and other dry materials 
should be sifted or stirred lightly with a spoon 
before measuring. 

To measure liquids, a cupful is all the cup will 
hold. 

To measure solids, as butter, pack solidly into 
cup or spoon and level with a knife. 

In measuring acids, do not allow them to remain 
long in the tin cup ; use a silver spoon when meas- 
uring a small quantity.

SEASONINGS AND FLAVORINGS 

In order to avoid monotony in cooking, and 
produce a pleasing variety of dishes when using 
almost the same materials, it is necessary to keep 
on hand a supply of flavoring and seasoning 
materials. A list is given below of the ones most 
frequently used; those most appropriate in sweet 
dishes being grouped together and those used in 
savory dishes, such as soups, stews, etc. 

Flavorings for Sweet Dishes 



Vanilla bean or 


extract 


Cloves 


Almond extract 




Nutmeg 


Orange rind and 


juice 


Allspice 


Lemon rind and 


juice 


Ginger 


Cinnamon 




Mace 


Caramel 






Seasonings for Savory Dishes 


Pepper 




Onion extract 


Peppercorns 




Cloves 


Cayenne 




Thyme 


Paprika 




Bay leaves 


Curry powder 




Worcestershire sauce 


Sage 




Parsley 


Summer savory 




Capers 


Sweet marjoram 




Mustard 


Celery extract 




Pimento 



SEASONINGS AND FLAVORINGS 9 

Celery seed Dried peppers 

Onion Green .peppers 

Celery leaves Red peppers 

Pot herbs Horseradish 

Tabasco sauce 

Avoid using the same seasonings or flavorings 
in every dish. Where several flavors are com- 
bined, keep all somewhat equally balanced so that 
no one is conspicuously present. Skill in the art 
of cooking consists in a careful selection and per- 
fect blending of all flavoring and seasoning in- 
gredients.

pensive than the uncooked cereals, but they are 
more easily and quickly served. Cereals should 
be kept in a cool, dry place; warmth will favor 
the development of insect life ; and moisture, when 
absorbed, makes them musty. 

General Rules 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked. A 
long slow cooking improves both flavor and diges- 
tibility. This result may be obtained by cooking 
in either a double boiler or fireless cooker. When 
using a double boiler fill the lower part one-third 
full of boiling water; it must be kept boiling while 
the cereal is cooking. If more water is needed 
before the cooking is completed, boiling water 
must be used. 

Mush may be poured into bread pans which 
have been wet with cold water. When cold, cut 
in one-third-inch slices, dip in flour or fine bread 
crumbs, and saute. 

Any cold mush may be thinned with cream, 
milk or water, strained, and served as a gruel. 

Cooking of Cereals 

Pour the required amount of water into the 
upper part of the double boiler, add salt, and when 
it boils, sprinkle in the dry cereal, stirring directly 
over the fire until it thickens. Then place over 
boiling water and cook until thoroughly done. 

As Hominy Grits and Oatmeal require cooking

BREAD 

General Rules 

Use flour containing a large percentage of 
gluten, or a flour called entire or whole wheat. 
Graham flour contains the bran coat of the wheat 
grain, and makes a dark loaf. 

Flour should be kept in a dry place. It should 
be warmed just before using. 

When milk is used, scald it to prevent souring. 
Milk and water are used lukewarm. 

Yeast must be fresh. Dissolve compressed 
yeast in lukewarm water. 

When bread is started at night, use one-half the 
quantity of yeast called for in the following 
recipes. 

Loaves of bread should be baked about one hour 
in a hot oven. Reduce the heat of the oven after 
bread has browned. When baked, the loaves 
should be placed on a wire rack to cool, covered 
with a single cloth. 

Biscuit and rolls require a hotter oven than 
bread. 

Bread should be kept, without a cloth, in a 
tightly covered tin box. The box should be 
scalded daily.

INSTITUTION RECIPES 



Flour Substitutes 

In substituting other cereal flours for wheat, it 
is possible to use any on the market with good 
results, where baking powder is used as the 
leavening agent. With yeast anything over 50 % 
substitution is difficult to make into light and 
easily digested bread, unless egg, baking powder 
or gelatin is used with the yeast. 

In preparing the pans oil very thoroughly, and 
heat them; and when the muffins or cakes are 
taken from the oven, allow to stand three to five 
minutes on the cooling rack before removing from 
pan, otherwise the cakes are likely to stick and 
break. 

The following table gives necessary variations : 

Extra Baking 
% Powder 

Flour Substitution Per Pint Additional Liquid 

Barley 100% 1 teaspoon none 

Buckwheat* 50% % teaspoon none 

Cornflour 100% 1 teaspoon about double 

Oat flour* 50% 1 teaspoon about % more 

Rice flour* 50% % teaspoon none 

Rye 100% none none 

*May be used with 50 per cent barley, com or rye flour 
instead of wheat. 

Corn-meal, mashed potato, or boiled rice may be 
substituted 50% with any of the above flours. 
Corn-meal requires more, rice and potato less 
liquid. 

Where potato flour is substituted for wheat, not 
more than one-half the bulk called for can safely 



BREAD 37 

be used, as its thickening property is about double 
that of wheat. Potato flour gives excellent results 
in sponge cakes, and may be used, with care, in 
butter cakes, but should not be used more than 
25% substitution in baking powder or yeast 
breads, as the breads made with higher per cent 
are soggy and indigestible.

USES FOR STALE BREAD 
Dried Bread Crumbs 

Dry stale bread, broken crusts, or toast in the 
warming oven. When thoroughly dry, pass 
through the food chopper or use the "Clad" 
grater; then sift to remove the coarse pieces. 
Keep in jars in a dry place. Stale crackers may be 
dried and used in the same way. 

Use for croquettes, fried oysters, veal cutlet, 
etc. Do not use these crumbs with scalloped 
dishes, as they are too dry and fine. The coarse 
pieces which remain in the sifter may be served 
with cream soups, using a spoonful in each plate.

BAKING POWDER MIXTURES 

General Rules 

Pastry flour should be used, if possible. Flour 
must be sifted before it is measured; then mix 
and sift dry ingredients. 

Six teaspoons of baking powder will raise one 
quart of flour. 

The eggs are beaten whole and the milk is added 
tc them, then added to the dry ingredients. When 
fat is used, it may be worked into the flour with 
the tips of the fingers, or cut in with a knife. 

The pans or muffin rings should be greased be- 
fore the mixture is prepared. Iron gem pans must 
be heated. 

The oven must be ready for baking before mix- 
tures are prepared; they must be put into the 
oven as soon as prepared, and baked from twelve 
to thirty minutes. Bake on the floor of the oven ; 
they may be raised to the shelf to brown.

EGGS 

Eggs should be kept in a cool dry place. To 
determine their freshness the following tests may 
be used: 

1. Hold the egg in front of a candle in a dark 
room; if fresh, the center should look clear. 

2. Place eggs in pan of cold water; if fresh, 
they should sink to the bottom ; a stale egg rises 
in the water. 

During the summer, eggs may be preserved for 
future use by packing in sawdust, small end down ; 
or they may be packed in cases, having a separate 
compartment for each egg, and kept in cold stor- 
age. 

The following practical method of preserving 
eggs will be found satisfactory: Pack fresh eggs, 
small end down, in clean earthen or tin vessels, 
and cover with a solution of water glass or silicate 
of sodium ; cover carefully and keep in a cool place. 
For the solution, use one part of water glass to 
ten parts of boiled water, which has been cooled 
before mixing. Eggs are better if removed from 
solution twelve hours before using. 

The yolk of an egg may be kept from hardening 
by excluding the air; place yolks in a bowl and 
cover with paraffin paper or with a saucer.

SOUPS 

Only clear soups should be served with a full 
dinner; cream soups and purees are so nutritious 
that, with bread and butter, they furnish a satis- 
factory luncheon. 

Soups are divided into two classes: soups with 
stock; soups without stock. 

Soups with stock have for their foundation, 
beef, veal, mutton, poultry, etc. They are classi- 
fied as follows: 

Bouillon, made from lean beef, delicately sea- 
soned and usually cleared. Clam bouillon is never 
cleared. 

Brown Soup Stock, made from beef (using at 
least two-thirds lean meat, the remainder may be 
bone and fat), highly seasoned with vegetables, 
spices and sweet herbs. 

White Soup Stock, made from chicken or veal, 
with delicate seasonings. 

Consomme, usually made from two or three 
kinds of meat, highly seasoned with vegetables, 
spices and sweet herbs. Always served clear. 

Lamb Stock, delicately seasoned, is served as 
mutton broth. 

Soup stock and clear soups contain very little 

69 



70 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

nourishment, their value is chiefly due to the sol- 
uble constituents, mineral matter and gelatin 
from the meat. 

In calculating the food value of the soup recipes, 
the fuel value of meat stock has not been included. 

Soups without stock are classed as cream soups. 
These are made of vegetables or fish, with milk 
and seasonings. They are always thickened. 

Purees, made from vegetables and fish forced 
through a strainer and retained in the soup, are 
generally thicker than cream soups. 

The thick portion of a cream soup or puree will 
separate from the liquid portion, when allowed to 
stand, unless bound together. To bind the soup, 
make a sauce, using fat, flour and liquid, as in 
making White Sauce, and combine with the other 
ingredients of the soup. 

Soda may be used in soups made of peas and 
beans, to soften the casein; soda is used with 
tomatoes to neutralize the acid. 

Crisp crackers, Croutons or Soup Sticks may be 
served with the soup. 

Remove all fat before serving. If soup is hot, 
remove as much as possible with a spoon, and that 
remaining with unsized paper. 

The following recipes are calculated to serve 
five portions to each quart. 

Soup Stock 

30 pounds bones and meat 1 cup salt 

15 gallons cold water 1 tablespoon peppercorns 



SOUPS 71 

Clean the bones, put into large steam cooker, 
with the cold water and seasoning. Heat slowly 
and simmer six or eight hours. Drain off the 
stock, add one pail of cold water to the bones, stir 
and allow to cook one-half hour, drain again, and 
add this liquid to the stock. Pour into "stock 
pot" without removing fat and stand in refriger- 
ator until needed. Will keep a week or more if 
the covering of fat remains unbroken. Remove 
all fat before using. 

Care of Copper Cooker After Stock Is Removed 

Wash upper edge of cooker, remove bones and 
pieces of meat; half fill with water, add one-half 
cup of washing soda, and boil ten minutes. Wash 
thoroughly with oleine soap and the soda water, 
using a brush. Use sand soap only when abso- 
lutely necessary, as it removes the tin from the 
surface. Clean the outside with weak oxalic water 
and whiting, rubbed on with a cloth and polished 
with a dry flannel. 

Care of Aluminum Cooker After Stock Is Removed 

Remove bones and pieces of meat. Fill with 
water and let soak an hour or more. Draw the 
water off, wash with hot soap suds (do not use 
washing soda) . A pot brush is needed to remove 
the rim of dirt. Rinse and dry with a soft cloth. 

Wash the outside with fresh soap suds and pol- 
ish with soft cloth. 



72 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

For spots that are difficult to remove use min- 
eral wool, soap and water, and polish until surface 
is clean. Rinse and dry with soft cloth. 

Brown Stock 

Bones and brown pieces of meat left from roast 
beef J lamb or veal. Cover with cold water. Cook 
slowly six hours, strain, remove all fat, and use as 
foundation for Vegetable, Barley, Noodle or other 
soups. 

Vegetable Soup Flavoring 

1 bushel tomatoes 10 green peppers 

1 peck okra 2 dozen ears com 

5 or 6 onions 1 cup salt 

Skin tomatoes and cut in pieces. Chop onions 
fine; take out seeds from peppers and put them 
through the food chopper. Mix all ingredients 
together, add salt and bring to boiling point. Add 
com, cut from the ears, and okra cut in small 
slices. Cook slowly until about as thick as jam. 
This recipe makes about ten quarts. Seal in jars. 
To each quart of any thin soup add two or three 
tablespoons of this flavoring.

corns, one teaspoon cloves, six bay leaves, two 
cups each chopped carrots, turnips and cabbage, 
one cup onion, one bunch parsley, to seven gallons 
of stock. Strain and remove all fat. 

If desired perfectly clear, cool the soup and add 
to each gallon of stock the whites and shells of 
two eggs, well mixed with one cup cold water. 
Heat to the boiling point, stirring constantly; boil 
three minutes, reduce the heat, and simmer gently 
fifteen minutes; remove the scum as it forms. 
Strain through cheesecloth. 

Beef Broth 

8 pounds lean meat 4 quarts cold water 

1 tablespoon salt 

Select meat from lower part of round, cleanse, 
remove all fat, and pass meat through food chop- 
per. Cover with the cold water and stand one 
hour in a cold place; put saucepan over warm 
water and cook slowly until it becomes a reddish- 
brown color (167° F.), stirring frequently. Strain 
through a coarse sieve, add salt and chill. When 
cold, remove fat. To reheat the broth, pour into 
a saucepan surrounded by hot water, stir con- 
stantly until hot. Do not allow the water to boil, 
as this will toughen the albumen. To make the 
broth more nutritious, add the white of one egg to 
each cup of broth. This broth is intended espe- 
cially for invaUds.

especially for invalids. 



Turkey Soup 

(150 Portions) 

After carving roast turkey, remove pieces of 
white meat and the stuffing from eight or nine 
turkeys, break the bones, put into the stock ket- 
tle with leaves, roots, outside pieces of celery, and 
uncooked ends of the wings removed before roast- 
ing; cover with about six gallons of cold water, 
simmer slowly five or six hours. If allowed to 
boil, the soup will become clouded and lose the 
delicate poultry flavor. 

Strain, remove fat, season with three-fourths of 
a cup of salt, one-half teaspoon pepper, one-half 
teaspoon onion juice, and celery salt, if desired. 
Add the white meat cut in one-half inch pieces 
and one and one-half cups boiled rice. 

This soup may be used as a white stock in mak- 
ing any cream soup.

OYSTERS 

General Rules 

Oysters are in season from the first of Septem- 
ber to the first of May; they may be obtained dur- 
ing the summer months, but are of poor flavor. 

When raw oysters are served, use a small vari- 
ety. 

Prepare oysters by pouring cold water over 
them in a colander; remove pieces of shell; strain 
the juice through a cloth. 

Oysters require little cooking and should not be 
cooked at a high temperature, as this will cause 
them to become tough. 

Raw Oysters 

Blue Points or other small oysters should be 
used. Allow six oysters to each person. The 
shells should be scrupulously clean, and the 
oysters served on the deep shell. Arrange on a 
bed of crushed ice with valve end of shell toward 
the center of plate, and garnish with lemon and 
parsley.

FISH 
General Rules 

Fish must be perfectly fresh and should be kept 
in a cold place until cooked. Do not put in re- 
frigerator with other food on account of odor; 
keep an ice-box especially for fish. The flesh 
should be firm and the eyes bright and not sunken. 

Frozen fish may be kept for a long time, but 
must be used at once when thawed, as it spoils 
more quickly than fresh fish. Thaw frozen fish 
in cold water. 

The inside and outside of fish should be thor- 
oughly cleansed with a cloth wet with salt water; 
the head, tail, fins and organs should be removed. 
White fish which are dry should have butter 
rubbed over them before broiling. 

When fish is cooked, the flakes or flesh separates 
from the bones. It should be served hot, with 
sauce, or garnished with lemon, hard-cooked eggs, 
or parsley. 

Cold cooked fish may be used in various ways, 
as Creamed, Scalloped, etc.

To Select Poultry 

A young chicken has many pinfeathers on the 
body, the skin is smooth, clear and tender, the 
feet soft, an inch or more of cartilage at the end 
of the breastbone. When chicken becomes a year 
old, it is called fowl. The body then has many 
hairs, the skin is thick and yellow, owing to the 
layer of fat which forms under the skin as the 
fowl grows older. The scales on legs and feet 
become coarse and the spurs long; cartilage at the 
end of breastbone hardens and is very firm. 

There is a larger amount of meat in proportion 
to the bone in a fowl than in chicken, hence the 
advantage of selecting fowl to stew, fricassee, and 
serve cold. 

To Dress and Clean Poultry 

Singe by holding the chicken over a flame from 
gas, alcohol, or burning paper. 

Cut off the head, turn back the skin, and cut 
the neck off quite close; take out windpipe and 
crop, cutting off close to body. Cut through the 
skin around the leg one inch below the leg joint. 

lis 



116 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

Take out the tendons and break the leg at the 
joint; in old birds each tendon must be removed 
separately by using a skewer. 

Remove pinfeathers with the point of a knife. 
Remove oil bag from the tail. 

The internal organs are not always removed 
before the chicken is sold. If they have not been 
removed, make an opening under one of the legs, 
or at the vent, and remove them carefully, leav- 
ing a strip of skin above the vent. The intestines, 
gizzard, heart and liver should all be removed 
together; care must be taken that the gall-bladder, 
which lies under the liver, be not broken ; it must 
be carefully cut away from the liver. The lungs 
and kidneys lying in the hollows of the backbone 
must be carefully removed. Press the heart to 
extract any blood. Take oif outer coat of gizzard. 
The gizzard, heart and liver constitute the giblets. 
Wash the giblets, put heart, gizzard, neck and tips 
of wings into cold water, heat quickly and simmer 
until tender. As liver requires shorter cooking 
than the other giblets, it should be added and 
cooked with them the last half hour.

any organs that may remain in the turkey; wash.

pull the leg forward and disjoint from body; cut 
off wing. Remove leg and wing from other side 
without moving fork or changing position of bird. 
Carve breast meat in thin slices, beginning near 
the point of breast bone and cutting toward the 
wing joint. Turn bird to one side, remove slice 
of white meat from back, over the ribs, the flat 
oyster-shaped piece of dark meat which lies in the 
hollow of the back, and the portion of dark meat 
from the hip bone. Separate second joint from 
drumstick, cut meat from drumsticks, making

MEATS 

Good beef should be firm, elastic and when first 
cut, a purplish red, becoming a bright red and 
moist upon exposure to the air. The lean meat 
should be well mottled with fat; a thick layer 
of light straw-colored fat extending over the rib 
and loin cuts. The kidney suet should be white 
and crumbly. Lean beef, with very little fat, is 
tough and is usually taken from a poor under-fed 
animal. If beef is very dark or greenish in tint, 
the meat is stale. 

Veal should be pink in color and have white fat. 
When the flesh lacks color it has come from too 
young an animal. White lean veal is unfit for use. 
Beef may be served rare, but veal must be thor- 
oughly cooked. 

The characteristics of good mutton are the 
same as those of beef, except that the flesh is 
lighter in color and the fat is whiter. The strong 
flavor of mutton is greatly reduced if the pink 
membrane, which surrounds the meat, is removed 
before cooking. The fat of mutton has a strong, 
disagreeable flavor, and most of it should be 
removed. It is not good for cooking purposes, and 
can only be used for soap making. 

125 



126 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

The flesh of lamb is lighter in color than that 
of mutton and has a much more delicate flavor. 
Mutton is sometimes served rare, but lamb is 
classed with white meats and must be well 
cooked. 

The lean meat of pork should be firm, and of a 
pale pink color; the fat, hard and white. Soft, 
flabby meat with tiny kernels in it should not be 
used. Pork is rather difficult of digestion, because 
of the large amount of fat it contains, and should 
only be served during the winter months.

General Rules 

Meat should be removed from the paper in 
which it was wrapped and kept in a cool place. 

Meat must be weighed, trimmed, and wiped with 
a damp cloth. 

Only tender cuts of meat should be broiled, pan- 
broiled, or roasted. When meat is to be cooked by 
any of these methods, it is first seared, then the 
temperature slightly lowered ; by searing, the albu- 
men on the outside of the meat is hardened and 
the meat is cooked in its own juices. 

Tough meat should be cooked in water; boiling 
water hardens the albumen on the outside and 
keeps in the juices. Meat should be put in boiling 
water and the water allowed to boil five or ten 
minutes, then cooked at a low temperature until 
tender. If the water bubbles, it is too hot. All 
tough meat may become tender if cooked in this 
way. The time for roasting or cooking meat in 
water varies with the weight and quality. 

Stock and broth are prepared by soaking in cold 
water and cooking at a low temperature several 
hours. 

The meat which remains after straining may be 
used in any place where cooked meat is used, with 
the addition of a little fresh meat to give it flavor. 

Stock may be kept a week or more if the cover- 
ing of fat remains unbroken as it excludes the air 
and prevents decomposition. Fat must be entirely 



MEATS 129 

removed before using stock or broth, and may be 
used for cooking, in place of dripping. 

The trimmings of fat from meat should be clari- 
fied and may be used for cooking or for making 
soap.

Roast Ribs of Beef 

(150 Portions) 
45 pounds of beef in two pieces 

Cleanse, remove spinous process, shoulder-blade, 
and piece of cartilage; skewer into shape, dredge 
with salt, pepper and flour. Place on racks in 
roasting pans, rib side up. Cover bottom of pans 
with water and put into hot oven. Baste with 
water and fat, which has been tried out, every 
twenty minutes, adding more water to pans as 
needed. When brown and about half cooked, turn 
the roasts with the skin side up that they may 
become a rich brown. 

Roast about ten minutes to each pound of meat, 
starting in hot oven and decreasing heat after 
roasts have browned on both sides. 

If meat is very cold, stand in kitchen two hours 
before roasting, otherwise it will brown before 
heating through, and meat will be raw in center 
and overdone on the outside.

General Rules 

Wash thoroughly; pare or scrape, if skins 
must be removed. Stand in cold water until 
cooked, to keep them crisp and to prevent their 
being discolored. Cook in boiling water or steam. 
Use one tablespoonful of salt with every gallon 
of water; put the salt into the water when the 
vegetables are about one-half cooked. All vege- 
tables must be drained as soon as tender. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper and serve hot with butter 
or sauce. 

Cold vegetables may be used for salads, or may 
be placed in baking dish with one-half the quantity 
of sauce, covered with buttered crumbs and 
browned in a hot oven. 

Canned vegetables are sold in cans of different 
sizes, and are referred to by number, according to 
the size. No. 1, No. 2, No. 2i/^ and No. 3 are 
those commonly used in the home. No. 10 size is 
frequently called a gallon can, but it does not 
always contain a full gallon. The brand costing 
the least money is not necessarily the cheapest one 
to purchase. When selecting canned goods it is 
well to test several brands. Pour the contents of 
a can into a colander, drain off the liquid, measure 
it, and weigh the solid material. Test several 
cans in this way and then compare the price, 
amount of liquid and weight of solids in the differ- 
ent cans. The cheapest brand is the one which 



VEGETABLES 165 

yields the largest amount of solid food in propor- 
tion to its cost. 

When using canned vegetables, turn them into 
a sieve or colander, and pour water from the faucet 
over them, in order to remove the taste of the can. 
Allow them to stand an hour to improve the flavor.

SALADS 

Almost all kinds of meat, fish, vegetables and 
fruits may be mixed with a dressing and served 
as salads. It is essential to serve the salad cold 
and daintily garnished. 

All salad plants, as celery, lettuce and water- 
cress, should be carefully washed in cold water 
to free them from dust and insects. They should 
be allowed to stand in cold water for a while to 
become crisp. Shake the water from the leaves 
and dry them without bruising, using a clean 
towel or soft cheesecloth. Do not add the dress- 
ing until ready for serving, as it wilts the leaves. 

Meat or fish should be cut into one-half inch 
dice, marinated with French Dressing and allowed 
to stand an hour before combining with the other 
parts of the salad. Mix with the Mayonnaise 
before serving. French Dressing is used with 
green vegetable salads and either Mayonnaise or

SANDWICHES 

Sandwiches for service with a salad or with 
afternoon tea are much smaller and less substan- 
tial than those prepared for the school luncheon; 
but for all purposes they should be carefully made 
and attractively served. 

Bread for sandwiches should be of fine grain 
and twenty-four hours old. Select a square loaf, 
cut off the crust and make the loaf a good shape 
before cutting the slices. If butter is to be used, 
it should be creamed and spread on the loaf, then 
cut in very thin slices and spread with the mix- 
ture used. Put two pieces of bread together and 
cut into shape desired. 

For luncheon sandwiches, use the large sand- 
wich loaves, and do not remove the crusts. A 
bread cutter is a great saver of time and material, 
if it is properly adjusted and carefully used. 

The crumbs which collect around the cutter 
may be used to thicken soups or dried for fine 
bread crumbs. 

Sandwiches may be made some time before they 
are used, and may be kept fresh by covering with 
a damp cloth or wrapping them in parafl[in paper.

Butter Balls 

Scrub butter paddles with white soap and boil- 
ing water, rinse in clear boiling water, and chill 
in ice water. This should be done thirty minutes 
before paddles are to be used. 

Keep butter in covered vessel, in a cold place. 
With a piece of paraffin or rice paper over the 



SANDWICHES 217 

blade of a knife, cut each half-pound of butter into 
sixteen pieces of equal size. To form the balls, 
shake water from paddles, hold one paddle firmly 
in the left hand, and roll each piece until round 
with the paddle in the right hand. In skilled 
hands a variety of shapes may be made. 

To save the time and labor of making butter 
balls for the institution family, a butter cutter 
adjusted to cut a pound of butter into square 
individual portions may be used. 

Pieces of butter taken from butter chips should 
be washed in cold water, using the paddles, and 
placed in covered stone jar, to be used for cooking 
purposes.

DESSERTS PREPARED WITH GELATINE 

General Rules 

If possible, soak gelatine in cold water until it 
is softened; the boiling water then dissolves it. 
It should be covered with a cloth while soaking. 

If gelatine must be softened quickly, pour cold 
water over the gelatine and heat over boiling 
water until it dissolves. 

The cbth through which jellies are strained 
should be wet in hot water. 

If jellies are to be moulded, the moulds should 
be wet with cold water. 

Jellies should be placed near the ice to harden, 
but may be hardened quickly by surrounding 
with ice water. 

One-half box of Nelson's gelatine equals one 
box of Cox's gelatine. One tablespoon granulated 
gelatine equals one-fourth box of Nelson's gela- 
tine. The amounts here given are for granulated 
gelatine.

FROZEN DESSERTS 

General Rules 

The can, cover and dasher of fr'eezer should be 
scalded and then chilled. 

Adjust can carefully in tub; pour in mixture, 
put in dasher, cover, adjust crank and pack with 
finely chopped ice and rock salt. Use three times 
as much ice as salt for freezing. 

In freezing ice cream the crank should be turned 
slowly and steadily; in freezing sherbets, turn 
rapidly and steadily; in freezing water ice or 
frozen fruit, turn crank steadily five minutes, 
allow to stand five minutes, turn again five min- 
utes, and continue until freezing is completed. 

When frozen, remove dasher, press the cream 
down and make it smooth on the surface, place 
paraffin paper on top of can, cover with lid, and 
put a cork in the hole; draw off all the water, 
repack with salt and ice, using four times as much 
ice as salt; cover the whole with newspaper or 
blanket and stand several hours. 

In preparing frozen fruit or water ice, the sugar 
and water should be made into a syrup, which 
should be boiled five minutes; then strained. In 
preparing ice cream with fruit, the sugar and 

253 



254 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

crushed fruit should stand one hour in a cool 
place, or until the sugar is dissolved, then add 
cream and freeze; in preparing ice creams, one- 
half the cream should be scalded and the sugar 
dissolved in it; cool; add flavoring and freeze. 

Fruit juice is used for water ice; the fruit is 
pressed through a colander or cut in small pieces 
with a silver knife for frozen fruit; either juice 
or crushed fruit may be used for ice cream. It 
is preferable to use only the juice of very seedy 
fruits.

CAKES AND FROSTINGS 

General Rules 

Use pastry flour for all cake mixtures, as it con- 
tains less gluten than bread flour, and therefore 
makes a lighter, more tender cake. If bread flour 
must be used, allow two ounces less for each pound 
of flour called for in the recipe. 

Sift flour before measuring. The flour and 
baking powder should be mixed and sifted several 
times, and if spices are used, they should be 
sifted with the flour. 

Cream the butter, add the sugar gradually. The 
yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten 
separately, and the yolks added to the butter and 
sugar. The bowl in which they were beaten should 
be rinsed with the milk. The milk and flour are 
added alternately, then the flavoring and the 
whites. When fruit is used mix with a little of 
the flour called for in the recipe, and add just 
before the whites of the eggs. 

Line the bottom of each cake pan with soft 
paper and lightly grease the paper and sides of 
the pan. 

In baking cake divide the time required into 
quarters. During the first quarter the mixture 

261 



262 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

should begin to rise; second quarter, continue 
rising and begin to brown ; third quarter, continue 
browning; fourth quarter, finish baking and 
shrink from sides of pan. Bake cake thirty to 
sixty minutes, according to the size of the cake. 
Allow it to remain in the pan a few minutes after 
taking from the oven. Lard or other fat may be 
used in gingerbread.

sugar and then the beaten yolks of the eggs. Mix 
molasses and milk together, add three-fourths of 
it to the butter, sugar and eggs, then add the dry 
ingredients and mix until smooth; add remainder 
of the liquids and raisins ; fold in the beaten whites 
of the eggs, pour into greased baking pans and 
bake in a moderate oven forty-five or fifty min-

Cider Apple Butter 

(100 Quarts) 
50 gallons cider 50 gallons chopped apples 

25 pounds brown sugar 

Boil the cider until reduced one-half. Reserve 
a few gallons of cider to add to the sauce when 
nearly done, to cool it to prevent cooking over. 
Add a few gallons of apples at a time and cook un- 
til pieces of apple soften into the sauce, then add 
more apples and continue until all apples are in 
the cooker; this will require several hours. Stir 
constantly to prevent the sauce from adhering to

the bottom of the cooker. When all apples have 
been added and the mixture is dark brown in color 
and quite thick, add the sugar. Continue to boil 
until when dropped on a cold plate it will stand as 
a firm mass without any clear liquid separating 
from it. 

Seal in jars, or it may be put into stone jars as 
it will keep without being airtight. 

One bushel of apples will yield about three gal- 
lons cider. 

One bushel of apples will yield about seven gal- 
lons chopped apples.

MENUS 

It is impossible to plan a menu that will be 
appropriate to the needs of several groups of per- 
sons, the number of calories per day will vary 
with the season and climate, the age, condition of 
health and the occupation of the individuals to 
be served. A man doing a moderate amount of 
muscular work requires about 3000 calories each 
day, while a man leading a sedentary life will not 
require more than 2500 calories, or if he is per- 
forming very active muscular work he will need 
3500 or more calories. A woman performing 
moderately active work and a boy fourteen to 
seventeen years old, require eight-tenths as many 
calories as a man at moderately active muscular 
work, A girl of the same age will require seven- 
tenths as many calories as a man, while a child 
from six to nine years requires about five-tenths 
that of a man. 

The foregoing recipes which show the number 
of calories of protein and the total calories are 
intended to help the busy dietitian who has little 
time for computing food values and yet wishes to 
serve a well-balanced menu and to know that her 
family is being adequately nourished. After plan- 
ning the menu the adequacy of the combination 



294 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

may be determined by adding the protein calories 
and the total calories in the different dishes which 
have been selected and comparing the result with 
the standard requirement for the group of per- 
sons who are being served. 

The fuel value of the protein in the diet, as 
represented by the protein calories, should be from 
ten to fifteen per cent of the total food value. 

The menu which follows provides for an aver- 
age of 2600 calories per person each day for one 
week, and shows the simple method of calculation.

SOAP 

In every kitchen there is an accumulation of 
various kinds of fat. In institutions where there 
is a large quantity it is usually considered to be 
more economical to sell the fat and buy soap for 
kitchen use. Many persons prefer to use the fat 
for soap making because the home-made soap is 
superior in quality to most kitchen soaps on the 
market. 

Home-made soft soap is a great convenience be- 
cause it is always ready to make a lather quickly. 
It is economical because only the amount neces- 
sary will be used. It is especially good for wash- 
ing glass and silver. 

Soft Soap 

5% pounds clean grease 18 quarts hot water 
1 can lye % cup ammonia 

Dissolve the contents of a can of lye in three 
quarts of the hot water. Melt the grease and 
while still on the stove pour into it gradually the 
dissolved lye, stirring constantly. Add the re- 
maining water and boil until the consistency of 
syrup. Allow to cool, add the ammonia and pour 
into jars or crocks to keep until used. When the 

811 



312 INSTITUTION RECIPES 

soap is cold it should resemble a soft jelly. If a 
thinner soap is desired more water may be added 
than called for in the recipe. 

Hard Soap 

5 pounds clean grease Vz cup ammonia 

1 box concentrated lye % cup powdered borax 

3% cups cold water 

Melt the grease and add the ammonia when it 
reaches a temperature of 120° Fahrenheit. Dis- 
solve the lye in the cold water and when it cools 
to 80° Fahrenheit, stir in the borax. Pour the dis- 
solved lye veiy slowly into the grease, and stir 
until lye and grease are thoroughly combined and 
the mixture drops from the spoon like honey. The 
stirring must be done slowly, but not too long; 
from one to five minutes; if stirred too long, the 
mixture will separate. Pour into a mould lined 
with paper and allow it to stand in a warm place 
about twenty-four hours. Empty from the mould, 
remove the paper and cut in pieces. Keep in a 
dry place.

insures whiter, sweeter and lighter cake and 
bread— it raises the baking just 
right, and adds to the nutritive 
value, as it restores the health-

wheat flour loses in the process 
of milling.

SWIFTNESS 

A Lynn (Mass.) nurse says: 'It is the swiftness 
of preparation of Jell-O that appeals particularly to 
busy nurses." 

Swiftness is an important incident, and so is 
flavor. Another is economy. 

Such dishes as the Pineapple Bavarian Cream, 
pictured above, are made of Jell-O, with none of the 
fussing that usually goes with the preparation of such 
dishes. 

Jell-O is put up in six pure fruit flavors: Straw- 
berry, Raspberry, Lemon, Orange, Cherry, 
Chocolate, and sells 2 packages for 25 cents.

You will find it every bit as satisfactory as expensive butter 

It is made of the concentrated food elements of the cocoa- 
nut and peanut, churned with rich pasteurized milk and 
cream with salt added. 

Costs a third less than butter and goes a third farther. If 
your grocer hasn't it, he will order it for you if you insist.

"Proper Serving of All Meats 
Extremely Important" 



Talking to one of the most well-known 
doctors and diagnosticians the other day. the 
conversation drifted to business and general 
conditions. 

"Regarding your machine," said he, "I 
do not give a rap about your Company or 
the financial result. But tell the head of 
your concern that he is not doing his duty if 
he does not advertise broadcast the vast 
amount of good your machine accomplishes. 
Aside from the fact that it eliminates xeaste of 
food, a matter of extreme importance at this 
time, it assists digestion, because the finely 
subdivided fibres of meat permit ready access 
to the digestive juices, giving the maximum of 
nourishment from a minimum amount of meat, 
thereby improving health, while exercising 
economy." 

Are you willing to investigate and do your 
little bit for humanity. 

Our service is free to you. Write us to- 
day, mention this book, and we will gladly 
arrange for a practical demonstration in your 
kitchen free of charge.
