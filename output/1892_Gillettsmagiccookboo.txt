SOUPS. 



Stock. 



Four pounds of shin of beef, four pounds knuckle 
of veal, any bones or trimmings of poultry or fresh 
meat, one-half pound of lean bacon or ham, two 
ounces of butter, two large onions stuck with cloves, 
three carrots, one head celery, one turnip, one bay 
leaf, two ounces salt, half a teaspoonful of whole pep- 
per, a pinch of mace, a bunch of thyme and savory, 
and four quarts and a half pint of cold water. 

Cut up the meat and bacon or ham into small 
pieces, cover with a pint of cold water and let simmer 
slowly, skim off the scum, then add the other ingredi- 
ents and the four quarts and one-half pint of water, 
and let boil for five hours, remove the scum and set 
to cool; when cold, again remove the scum, and strain. 
This will form into jelly and can be kept a long time 
in a cool place, and is the basis of many of our soups. 

White Stock. 

Six pounds of knuckle of veal, half a pound of 
bacon (lean), small piece of butter, two onions, two 
turnips, two carrots, pinch of mace, four cloves stuck 
into the onion, small bunch of thyme and savory, 
pepper and salt, one tablespoonful of flour, and six 
quarts of water. Cut up the meat and the bacon and 
crack all the bones, slice the vegetables and herbs 



GIUfETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



and add two quarts of water, and put on to boil. Let 
simmer slowly and take off the scum as it rises; then 
at the end of an hour add the rest of the water — one 
gallon. Let it cook steadily four hours, strain and 
set away to cool, in an earthen jar. This forms a 
basis for all the white soups used. 

Mutton Broth. 

Boil a piece of lean lamb or mutton for two or 
three hours in about four quarts of water, keeping the 
pot closely covered. Then soak one-half cup of rice 
and put in the soup; let boil for an hour, then put a 
well beaten egg in a cup of cold milk, thickened with 
a little flour, put in a little of the scalding liquor to 
prevent the egg from curdling the soup. Take out 
the meat and stir in this mixture, season with pepper, 
salt, thyme and a little parsley, let boil and serve. 

Mutton Broth No. 2. 

Boil one pound of lean loin of mutton with three 
pints of water for three hours; salt to taste; pour 
out the broth into a basin and when it is cold skim 
off the fat. It can be warmed up as wanted. This is 
the first preparation of animal diet that should be 
given during convalesence from any severe fever. 

Mutton or Lamb Broth. 

Take the water in which a leg of mutton or lamb 
was boiled in on the previous day, take off the fat 
and boil it two hours, with a turnip, an onion and a 
carrot cut fine, add some minced parsley and a spoon- 
ful of rice. All these except the parsley should be 
put in while the water is cold. 

Pea Soup. 

Put a pint of split peas to soak over night. About 
three hours before dinner pour off the water and add 



GIXLETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



two quarts of water, a carrot, an onion, a little celery or 
celery seeds and a small piece of salt pork. Boil it. 
steadily and be careful to stir it often lest it should 
burn; have boiling water at hand to add as the water 
boils away much faster in pea soup than in any other 
kind; strain it through a coarse sieve. A cup of milk 
added after the soup is done is an improvement. 

Bean Soup. 

Soak a quart of beans over night, cover with three 
quarts of water, and let boil with a piece of salt pork 
for several hours; season with celery, pepper and salt 
and strain through a colander. Croutons are very 
nice served with the soup. 

Barley Soup. 

Made the same as bean soup. 

Tomato Soup. 

One pint tomatoes, salt, two quarts water; boil 
one hour, then add one teaspoonful of soda, one pint 
milk, one-half pint rich cream, pepper and salt; let 
come to a boil; pour on rolled crackers. 

Tomato Soup No. 2. 

One can tomatoes, one bay leaf, one small onion, 
one pint water, one tablespoonful butter, two table- 
spoonfuls corn starch, one-quarter teaspoonful soda, 
one teaspoonful sugar, little parsley, salt and pepper 
to taste. Put the tomatoes, bay leaf, parsley, onion 
and water on to boil for a few minutes, then strain 
through a colander; rub the corn starch and butter 
together and when smooth, stir into the boiling soup. 
When smooth, add soda, salt, pepper and sugar; serve 
at once. 



GIIABTT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



Potato Soup. 

Four large potatoes, one small onion into which 
six cloves have been stuck, one piece celery; cook un- 
til potatoes fall to pieces, then take out the onions 
and celery and mash potatoes fine; pour enough boil- 
ing milk on the potatoes to make them the consis- 
tency of cream. Beat one egg and take a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, strain soup into this, season and stir 
well; serve immediately. 

Potato Soup No. 2. 

Four large potatoes, one onion; boil in two 
quarts of water until soft; press through a sieve and 
add one pint sweet milk, one tablespoon butter, salt 
and pepper to taste. Boil up again and serve. 

Puree of Potato Soup. 

Boil five or six potatoes with a little celery and 
onions, pass through a colander and add one-quarter 
pound of butter and enough hot milk to make it the 
consistency of thick cream; pepper and salt to taste. 
Chop fine a little parsley and throw in; boil one 
minute and serve. 

Consomme. 

Four pounds of beef, four pounds of veal, four 
quarts cold water, two ounces bacon, six cloves, a 
bunch of herbs, one tablespoonful salt, three onions, 
one carrot one turnip, two stalks celery, a little pars- 
ley, three eggs, a little celery salt, one lemon (juice 
and rind); wipe and cut the meat and bones into 
small pieces, then strain carefully and set away to

pint of strong white stock, allow to boil until celery 
is tender. Season with salt and cayenne pepper and 
serve. If cream is obtainable substitute one pint for 
same quantity of milk. 

To Color Soups. 

A fine amber color can be obtained by adding 
finely grated carrot to the clear stock when it is quite 
free from scum. 

Red is obtained by using red skinned tomatoes 
from which the skin and the seeds have been strained 
out. 

Spinach leaves pounded in a mortar, and the 
juice pressed out and added to the soup gives a green 
color. 

Black beans make an excellent brown soup. The

FISH, 



Any fish out of season is unwholesome; you can 
always tell if "the fish is eatable, by examining the 
eyes and scales; if the eyes are clear and the scales 
bright, and no unpleasant odor to it, it is in good 
condition, and should be cooked very soon after 
leaving the water, as the flesh becomes soft and turns 
color quickly. 

Clean the fish as soon as possible and cover the 
inside with a sprinkling of salt and put in the ice box 
or a cool place until used. Salt fish should always be 
soaked over night to freshen them, but fresh fish 
should not be soaked unless frozen, when they need 
cold water poured over them to thaw them out. . 

The usual modes of cooking fish, are boiling, fry- 
ing, baking or broiling; large fish are generally boiled 
and are sewn up into a bag, smaller fish are usually 
fried, and brook trout and smelts are served with the 
heads on; many consider that part quite a choice tid 
bit. In baking fish you need a slow fire, and to baste 
the fish often with butter and water, and some stuff it 
with a dry dressing of bread, butter, pepper and salt. 
Salmon is a very nutritious fish, and the most used of 
any and is usually boiled.

spoonfuls of chopped parsley and the juice of two 
lemons. Pour on the salmon and serve part in a boat. 

Broiled Salt Salmon or other Salt Fish.

slices of onion, a little parsley chopped fine, small 
piece of butter, little pepper and salt; when hot, stir 
in two tablespoonfuls either of corn starch or flour, 
which has been dissolved in a little cold milk; let it 
come to a boil, then remove; rub the inside of the dish 
with butter; first put a layer of fish, then the cream, 
then sprinkle cracker crumbs, so on until the dish is 
full, putting a layer of crumbs on top to keep the milk 
from scorching. This is a nice way to use up cold fish. 

Cold Boiled Fish a la Vinagrette. 

Take the skin and bones out and place in the 
center of a dish; have two hard-boiled eggs cut fine, 
sprinkle the fish with this and garnish with small 
lettuce leaves, water cresses, cold boiled potatoes or 
beets cut in slices, with here and there a sprig of 
parsley. Serve the vinagrette sauce in a separate 
dish, garnish and pour a spoonful of the sauce over 
each dish as you serve it. A nice dish for tea or lunch 
in summer and takes the place of a salad. 

Baked Fish. 

Fish will cook better if placed upright in the pan, 
instead of on one side. Fish that are flat like shad 
may be kept in place by propping up with stale bread 



GII^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 29 



or pared potatoes. Others may be made into shape of 
letter "S." Run a threaded needle through the head, 
middle of body and tail, and draw string, fasten the 
ends. Thus prepared fish will keep their shape and 
can be better served. In putting fish to bake, rub the 
pan well with salt pork, and put small pieces of pork 
under the fish, which will prevent it from sticking. 
Baste often with pork fat; bake until brown. 

Stuffing- for Fish Weighing' from Four to Six Pounds. 

One cup cracker crumbs, one saltspoonful salt, one 
saltspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful chopped onions, 
one teaspoonful chopped parsley, one teaspoonful ca- 
pers, one teaspoonful pickles, one-quarter cup melted 
butter. This makes a dry, crumbly stuffing. If a moist 
stuffing is desired use stale bread (not dried) crumbs 
and moisten with one beaten egg and the butter, or 
moisten the crackers with warm water. If an oyster 
stuffing is desired, use one pint oysters, one cup of 
seasoned and buttered cracker crumbs; drain and roll 
each oyster in the crumbs; fill the fish with the 
oysters and sprinkle the remainder of the crumbs 
over the oysters. 

Turbot A La Oreme. 

Boil fish with plenty of salt in water; take off the 
skk), being careful to keep it whole; boil one onion 
and a bunch of parsley in pint of milk; take four ta- 
blespoonfuls flour, one tablespoonful butter, mix well; 
add one pint of cream or milk; strain out the onion 
and parsley and add to the flour mixture; let it all boil 
five minutes, then add a pinch of mace and one table- 
spoonful anchovy sauce; grease a deep dish with but- 
ter, put spoonful of sauce on the bottom, then a layer 
of fish, so alternately until the dish is full; sprinkle 
bread crumbs on top with small pieces of butter; bake

of cream and a cup of milk in rice boiler, when hot 
add a tablespoonful of corn starch and a piece of 
butter rubbed together until smooth, to the hot 
cream; when it is thick add the oysters, pepper and 
salt, stir until all are heated, then serve. 

Escalloped Oysters. 

_ Line a baking dish with butter, then have ready 
a dish of bread crumbs, put first a layer of crumbs, 
then a layer of oysters, # butter in little pieces, salt 
and pepper; repeat untii the dish is full, being care- 
ful to have the crumbs on top, with small pieces of 
butter. Moisten with milk and a little of the oyster 
liquor. Bake until a good brown, in a hot oven and 
serve in the same dish. 

Broiled Oysters. 

Pick out large fat oysters, dry carefully and 
season well with salt and pepper, place on the broiler 
turn on the other side when browned and drop into 
a hot dish and pour melted butter over them. Some 
serve them on squares of buttered toast. 



GII^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 35 



Fried Oysters. 

Pick out very large fat oysters for frying, clean, 
drain and dry on a soft cloth, season well with salt 
and pepper; dip in beaten egg and roll in bread 
crumbs and drop in hot lard. Drain carefully on a 
piece of brown paper, then serve in a hot dish im- 
mediately. 

Scallops. 

There is only one part of this fish fit to use, that 
is the muscular part. They are sold by measure same 
a? clams and prepared about the same. 

Fried Scallops. 

Wash in boiling water, then drain; dry care- 
fully, season with salt and pepper, dip in egg and 
roll in cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard. 

Roast Clams. 

If at a clam-bake, the clams are left in the shells 
and roasted on hot stones; then open, empty juice 
into a pan, add the clams, pepper, butter and a pinch 
of salt. If at home roast in a pan over a hot fire, or 
put in the oven to roast and fix same as above. 

Stewed Clams. 

Put one-half peck of clams in a kettle with a 
little hot water and the steam will open the shell. 
Then take out of the shell and strain the liquor and 
put in with the clams again. When it has come to a 
boil add one cup of milk, a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, two crackers well rolled and salt and pepper 
to taste. 

Crabs. 

Crabs are sold alive, like the lobster, or boiled. 



2,6 GIIvI/ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 

Soft Shell Crabs^ 

Soft-shell crabs are the hard-shell crabs after 
they have shed their shell, as it becomes hard again 
in a few days; the supply is usually very scarce. 

Fried Soft Shell Crabs. 

Clean well and scrape out the fins under the 
shell; fry in lard and butter mixed until they become 
a little crisp. Serve on toast with melted butter 
poured over and a little parsley to garnish the dish 
with. 

Deviled Crabs, Hard-Shell. 

Take six fresh crabs, boil and chop fine, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, a little mustard powder, 
salt and pepper to taste. Put the meat into a dish and 
rub into it an equal quantity of bread crumbs. Mix 
the butter to a cream, then stir the mustard into it. 
add the crab meat, crumbs and a tablespoonful of 
cream, a little cayenne and salt to taste. Fill the 
crab shell with the mixture; put little pieces of 
butter on top and sprinkle with bread crumbs and 
brown in the oven. 

Lobsters. 

To pick out a lobster: you will find the heaviest 
are the best; never purchase boiled lobster, but the 
freshest and most lively ones you can get. To test 
the freshness of the lobster: the claws will have a 
strong motion when the eyes are pressed with the 
fingers and they will be very lively. The lobster is 
not thoroughly cooked unless it turns a bright red 
color. They are very indigestible however and 
should be avoided by dyspeptics. 



GIUETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 2>7 



Steamed Lobster. 

To steam a lobster put it in a steamer, over a 
fish kettle, and steam until it turns a very bright red. 
Serve with lettuce and salad. 

Deviled Lobster. 

Deviled lobster is made the same as deviled 
crabs, using one cup of lobster chopped fine instead 
of half a dozen crabs. This takes one small lobster. 
Serve with shells.

MEATS. 



A person should be very careful about cooking 
meats of all kinds, and it is most essential that they 
select the best. 

Beef should be smooth, of a clear red color, and 
tender, when pinched with the finger; and the fat 
should be white. 

Sirloins, ribs, and pin bone are the best parts for 
roasting. 

Veal should have a pinkish tinge; and the calf 
should not be killed till it is two months old, then 
the flesh is firm; before that time the flesh has a 
bluish look, and is flabby, and soft. 

Mutton is best, when the flesh is a bright red, 
very juicy, the grain Arm,' and close, and the fat firm 
and white. 

Pork is decidedly unwholesome, and very in- 
digestible for dyspeptics, and is chiefly used in cold 
weather, and it needs to be well cooked as a piece of 
rare pork is very injurious. 

Lamb is similar in looks to mutton, of a bright 
red color, and with white fat. Lamb is only in sea- 
son from April until September, and should be about 
the age of veal, two months old. Lamb should be 
very thoroughly cooked, and is best roasted, though 
some fry the chops, even if they are very small.

Roast Beef. 

Some prefer the first three ribs of beef for roast- 
ing, but for myself, I prefer the third, forth and fifth, 
but for a small family the first are more suitable. 
Do not take out the bone; but have your butcher 
chop it twice, and rub well with pepper, and salt, and 
dredge lightly with flour. If you do not use an im- 
proved roaster, place in a dripping pan, and pour a 
cupful of water into it. 

It does not take over an hour to cook an ordinary 
sized roast, and most persons prefer it medium rare; 
when done, place on a heated dish; then heat the 
gravy, and thicken with some browned flour and a 
little boiling water. Serve in a gravy boat. 



Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding. 

Bake exactly as directed for an ordinary roast 
beef, for the table, then make a Yorkshire pudding 
to eat with the roast, as follows: For every pint of 
milk, take three eggs, three cups of flour, a little salt, 
stir to a smooth batter, and pour into the dripping 
pan, under the meat, a half hour before it is done. 



Pot Roast. 

Get a piece of beef about six pounds in weight, 
but not too fat. Wash and put in the pot with a little 
water, let it cook slowly, and add a little pepper and 
salt, keep it cooking slowly until tender, let the water 
boil down and take the meat out of the pot, and what 
gravy there may be. Put a piece of butter in the 
pot, sprinkle a little flour on the meat, return to the 
pot and let it brown. Pour the gravy back into the 
kettle, add a little water, and flour to thicken it, then 
serve. 



GIIAETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 43 



To Corn Beef. 

Rub the beef with salt and a little saltpetre, until 
the salt lies dry upon itf put in a cool place for 
twenty-four hours, then repeat, and put away until 
the next day. 

For the pickle, take three gallons of water, two 
ounces of saltpetre, one-half gallon of salt, and three- 
quarters of a pound of brown sugar. Boil this brine 
a few minutes, then set away to cool. When the 
brine is cold, wipe the beef dry, and pour the pickle 
over it. This ought to keep the beef for some time. 

Corn Beef Hash. 

Three cups of boiled corned beef, chopped fine, 
one and one-half cups of mashed or chopped potatoes, 
milk, salt, pepper and melted butter. Put this in a 
frying pan, stir until it is smoking hot, then put it in 
a dish, and serve with poached eggs put on top of the 
hash. 

Beef Stew. 

Cut the beef in small pieces, put into a sauce-pan, 
with water enough to cover it, stew for an hour or so, 
then set away until the next morning; then season 
with salt, pepper, a little chopped onion, and if liked, 
a little parsley. Then let it stew for about one hour, 
add a little browned flour, dissolved in water, a little 
Worcestershire sauce, boil up once and serve. 

Beef Tongue Boiled.

corners to make the turn-over; turn over in skillet, 
and when thoroughly cooked slice upon a hot platter. 

Dried Beef on Toast. 

Chip the beef very thin, place in a sauce-pan, add 
a little butter, and milk, thicken with flour dissolved 
in water, add a little pepper, and pour over buttered 
squares of toast. 

Breakfast Chipped Beef. 

Put some milk and water on the stove, with a 
beaten egg, and add a little flour, let this boil up well, 
then add the chipped beef. Do not cook more than 
a minute, if the beef is not too salt, if will be season- 
ed right.

platter, and pour melted butter over it. 

Beefsteak Broiled. 

Have ready a bed of hot coals, then grease the 
broiler with butter, place the steak on it, let it broil 
nicely on one side, then turn on the other. Season 
with pepper and salt, and place on a hot platter, and 
pour plenty of melted butter over it. There is no 
definite time for broiling a steak, as it depends on 
the thickness entirely. If it is to be served rare, of 
course the length of time will be much shorter. 

Pin-bone, porterhouse, and sirloin are the best 
pieces for broiling. 



GII/CETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 47

disagreeable. When the meat is well moistened add 
some tomatoes peeled and seeded and cut in small 
squares. Pour over a half -glass of wine or stock; let 
all this simmer two and one-half or three hours. 
Carrots or turnips may be substituted for tomatoes.

MUTTON. 

Roast Mutton. 

The loin or leg is the best for roasting; wash thor- 
oughly and wipe dry; put in the dripping pan with a 
little water to baste with, adding the salt after it has 
begun to roast, as it is apt to draw out too much blood 
and make it tough, if put on at first; baste frequently, 
and just before taking it up, sprinkle a little flour over 
it and baste with melted butter; skim the fat off the 
gravy and thicken with browned flour; allow about 
twelve minutes to the pound for roasting. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Wash the leg carefully and wipe dry on a cloth; 
put in a pot of hot salted water and boil until tender; 
skim off the fat occasionally; when tender lay on the 
platter and serve with drawn butter and one cup of 
capers or nasturtiums in it; allow twelve minutes to 
the pound for boiling.

flour and water together and add to the gravy Serve 
green peas and mint sauce with the roast lamb. 

PORK. 

Roast Loin of Pork. 

Place the pork in the pan with a very little water 
under it; cook slowly at first, as the heat hardens the 
rind first; when done mix a little flour and water to- 
gether and add to the gravy; serve with apple sauce. 
Some prefer stuffing with roast pork, and it may be 
made of bread crumbs, onion, a little sage, pepper and 
salt, and instead of roasting with the pork, may be 
baked on a separate dish. 

Fried Pork Chops. 

The pork chops are fried the same as mutton 
chops, and some people sprinkle a little powdered sage

each egg separately in a saucer and slip into the fry- 
ing pan, into the ham fat; pour the hot fat over them, 
and as soon as the color changes, they are done; place 
them on top of the ham and send to the table hot. 

Bacon and Eggs. 

Fry lean strips of bacon until it is crisp, then take 
them out and lay on a platter; break the eggs separ- 
ately, gently slide them into the bacon fat, and when 
they have set, turn the hot lard over them until they 
are done.

a kettle of cold water and let it come to a boil, then 
keep it boiling steadily until done; allow about twenty 
minutes to the pound; if it is to be served hot, peel off 



54 GIIXETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



the skin and stick in a few whole cloves; if the ham is 
to be served cold, let it stand in the pot until the wa- 
ter becomes cold, then peel off and serve the same. 

Broiled Ham. 

Place on the broiler and have a nice bed of coals 
to broil it; turn the slices frequently, and when it is 
done, put on a hot platter and pour melted butter 
over it. Some prefer to use boiled ham for broiling, 
instead of raw. 

Potted Ham. 

Chop the cold ham fine; season with pepper, salt, 
a little mustard and a pinch of mace; mix all together 
and put in the oven a half hour, then in a stone jar;

to separate, then turn off the water; put the beans in 
a baking pot, with a half pound of salt pork buried in 
the beans; add two tablespoonfuls of molasses and 
cover the whole with water; bake in a slow oven all 
day; watch the beans, and if they become dry, add 
more water; when thoroughly cooked, it will be known

cutting it up in small square pieces. Put in a kettle 
and boil in water until it is perfectly tender, then add 
flour to make gravy enough to fill the dish you wish 
to bake the pie in; salt and pepper to taste. For crust 
take one pint of flour, rub in about two tablespoonful 
of butter or lard, mix it thoroughly with the flour

POULTRY AND GAME. 



Poultry and Game. 

In picking out poultry select plump fat ones, 
being careful to see that they are fresh; and by trying 
the skin back of the wing you can tell if it is young 
and tender. With a turkey you can tell by rubbing 
the skin away from the breast bone, if that is easily 
broken it is sure to be young. Full grown 
poultry has the best flavor and are good for roast- 
ing, stewing and salads; the older ones may be 
made into soups, while spring chickens should either 
be broiled or fried. After a fowl has been cleaned 
and drawn it should be hung up for at least twenty- 
four hours and it will not hurt poultry to let it 
freeze, allowing it several hours in a warm room to 
thaw. 

Pressed Chicken. 

Boil a chicken in as little water as possible until 
the bones can be easily separated from the meat; re- 
move all the skin, cut up and mix together the light 
and the dark meat; season with salt and pepper. 
Boil down the liquid in which the chicken was boiled,

with pepper and salt, dip in flour or egg and roll in 
bread crumbs. Have a pan ready with butter and 
lard mixed; place the chicken in it and fry brown on

tender. 

How to Cook Duck. 

To remove the fishy flavor put a carrot in each 
duck, put into boiling water, boil ten minutes then 
remove from the water and prepare with the usual 
dressing; then make a dough of flour and water, stiff 
enough to roll, roll half an inch thick; cover each 
duck after it is in a dripping pan; put in a little 
water. Bake the usual length of time, remove the 
dough when done and they will be moist and tender. 
No basting is required. 

Wild Ducks. 

Wild ducks should be cooked rare, with or with- 
out stuffing; baste them a few minutes at first with 
hot water to which has been added an onion and salt; 



62 GIU.EXT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



then take away the pan and baste with butter and a 
little flour to froth and brown them. The fire 
should be quite hot and twenty to thirty minutes is 
considered the outside limit for cooking them. A 
brown gravy made with the giblets should be served 
in the bottom of the dish. Serve also a currant jelly. 
Garnish the dish with slices of lemon. 

Roast Wild Duck. 

Wild duck may be kept several days in cold 
weather and it improves the flavor and quality very 
much. 

Prepare the same as chicken, washing well and 
singeing; wipe carefully and if the ducks have any 
strong, fishy odor, put a cranberry or two inside them 
or rub a piece of onion over the breast. Put in a pan 
with a little water and some salt and baste quite 
often with melted butter. Turn and when a nice 
brown they are ready to serve. Wild ducks are not 
usually stuffed, though some prefer tomato dressing. 

Roast Duck (Tame). 

Clean thoroughly same as for other roast fowl 
and wipe carefully; beat the breast bone flat with a 
rolling pin, tie the wings and legs securely and stuff. 
Take one quart of bread crumbs and one onion chopp- 
ed fine, a piece of butter, pepper, salt and a half tea- 
spoonful of sage. After stuffing the duck sew it up 
nicely, to keep the flavor in; put in a dripping pan 
with a little water and baste often with salt water, 
turn so that the sides and back will be well browned. 
Prepare the giblets for the gravy same as in other 
roast fowl recipes and serve with currant jelly. 

Roast Goose, 

Prepare the goose the same as turkey, then if it is 
old parboil it about two hours. Fill it with an 
onion stuffing and sew the openings up carefully. 



GILLETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 6$ 



The stuffing is made as follows: two cups of stale 
bread crumbs, a chopped onion, little sage, pepper 
and salt, the yolk of one egg and a piece of butter.

thread; tie the wings and legs close to the body and 
put in a kettle of boiling hot, salted water, being 
careful to have the breast downward. Boil until the 
skin breaks and skim frequently; serve with an 
oyster sauce. The liquid from this turkey makes 
delicious soup by seasoning same as chicken, soup. 

Roast Turkey. 

Look over your turkey carefully, pluck the 
remaining feathers, singe thoroughly with paper, 
then draw it, preserving the liver, heart and gizzard. 
In separating the liver be very careful not to break 
the gall -bag, as it renders the turkey uneatable if 
broken, by making it very bitter, it being impossible 
to remove the taste by washing. Have ready a 
filling of oysters, bread crumbs, sweet marjoram, 
parsley, salt, pepper and butter; fill the body and 
breast of the turkey with this mixture and then sew 
up with a thread and tie the legs. Dredge lightly 
w r ith flour; baste frequently with a little melted 
butter and when one side is nicely browned turn and 
brown the other. Chop the liver, heart and gizzard

ENTREES. 



Calves' Brains. 

Soak the brains in salt water for several hours; 
pick off all the skin after soaking; then stew them a 
few minutes in some salted water, turning them once; 
take them out and while they are cooling roll several 
crackers to a powder and beat an egg; then take the 
brains and slice them as thin as possible; dip them 
first in the eggs then in the cracker dust and have a 
pan of hot butter with a little lard mixed to keep it 
from scorching, and fry the brains to a beautiful brown. 
Serve while hot. 

Sweet Breads. 

Put in salt water for one hour; then put in boil- 
ing water for twenty minutes; then roll in cracker 
crumbs and fry in lard and butter, one tablespoonful 
of each, or all butter. 

Mock Smelts. 

This is a fine dish which is not fish at all. Make 
noodle dough as for soup, beating together with a 
rolling pin three eggs, a teaspoonful of salt and flour 
to make a stiff dough; cut into four pieces, roll out as 
thin as paper, spread on a paper to dry and when dry

enough roll up. With a sharp knife shave the roll 
into thin rings and boil them five minutes in water 
boiling when they are put in; brown a pint of bread 
crumbs in butter in a frying pan; skim out the mock 
smelts into the crumbs; pour a teacupful of milk over 
all; let it heat up then serve. 

Little Pigs in Blankets. 

Season large oysters with salt and pepper; cut fat 
bacon in very thin slices; wrap one oyster in each slice 
and fasten with toothpicks; heat frying pan and put 
in the little pigs; cook just long enough to crisp the

Escalloped Chicken. 

Pick the meat from the bones of a cold chicken, 
remove skin and gristle, chop quite fine. In the bottom 
of a buttered dish, sprinkle a thick layer of cracker 
crumbs; make this very wet with milk, then put in a 
layer of meat, sprinkle salt, pepper, and quite large 
pieces of butter on this. If the chicken has been 
baked, add small pieces of the dressing, then another 
layer of cracker crumbs, and make them very wet 
with milk, and continue as before. After the last 
layer of meat, take the gravy; if boiled, put a little of 
the broth in the oven, brown, then pour in the rest of 
the broth, and thicken, if baked, warm with a little 
hot water, and pour over it. For the top, take cracker 
crumbs, very wet with warm milk, then beat two eggs 
well, and stir into the cracker crumbs; pepper, salt, 
and butter. When you put it in the oven, put plate on 
top, not large enough to cover it entirely. You will 
know when it is done, by its bubbling around the edge 
of the plate, Remove the plate and let brown. 

Potted Beef. 

Take a fore shank of beef, (have your butcher saw 
it instead of chopping to avoid small bones); put on 
the fire with enough cold water to cover it; let it boil 
until the meat falls off the bones; then take out, but 
save the water. Chop the meat into about half inch 
pieces; skim the boiled water and return the meat.

PATTIES. 



Chicken Patties. 

Mince cold roasted or boiled chicken and season 
well; stir into this a sauce, made of one-half pint of 
milk into which, when boiling, a teaspoonful of corn 
starch has been added to thicken it; season with 
a teaspoonful of butter; salt and pepper. Line patty 
pans with a good puff paste, bake the crust in a 
brisk oven; then fill the pans and set in the oven a 
few minutes, to brown very slightly. 

Chicken Patties No. 2. 

One teacupful of cold roast or boiled chicken chop- 
ped fine, one tablespoonful of flour, one teacupful of 
chicken gravy, salt and pepper, a few green celery 
leaves. Cream, milk or hot water can be used in-

taste; let boil up, put in the oysters, add three table- 
spoonfuls cream, allow to heat, but do not boil. Line 
patty-pans with puff paste, and put into each a round 
cracker; cover with paste, and bake a light brown; 
when done remove the lids of the patty-dishes, take 
out the crackers, fill with the mixture, replace the 
covers, set in the oven for a moment and serve hot.

EGGS AND OMELETTES. 



Eggs are very nutritious, a dozen being equal to 
two pounds of beef steak. If properly cooked, they are 
the best and most easily digested food for invalids and 
delicate people. Raw eggs are very often given to 
those who cannot eat other solid food; there are so 
many ways of cooking eggs, that an almost endless 
variety of dishes can be prepared from them. Bread 
crumbs and dry bread can be used in preparing these 
delicate breakfast and lunch dishes; half a dozen eggs, 
half a loaf of bread or a cup of bread crumbs, a tomato 
or two, and a little butter properly put together, and 
you have a breakfast for a family of four; no one who 
properly understands how to use eggs, will ever be at 
a loss to prepare a meal; in beating eggs always beat 
one way; in making custards, pies, cakes or puddings, 
stir the mixture one way as much as possible, by do- 
ing this the grain of the egg is not broken and is 
much lighter. Limed eggs nearly always have a pecul- 
iar flavor that spoils them for most people. 

Baked Eggs. No. 1. 

Half-a-dozen eggs, lard or drippings, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Six slices of buttered toast. Use patty 
pans or gem tins to bake the eggs in. Grease the tins 
and lay a little piece of butter in each, then break an 
egg in each tin, sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, 
and put in the oven to bake; as soon as they set put 
them on the oven grate a moment. Serve on well- 



98 GII^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



buttered slices of toast; put a small piece of butter 
on each egg. This is a nicer way to cook eggs than 
to poach them. 

Baked Eggs. No. 2. 

Five eggs, a teacupfulof bread crumbs, half a tea- 
cupful of milk, tablespoonful of butter, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Pour the milk over the bread, mix the 
eggs, milk and bread together; add butter, pepper and 
salt. Grease a tin and pour the mixture in it, and 
place in a moderately hot oven. When done on the 
bottom put the tin on the grate of the oven for a 
minute or two. Serve on a hot platter, and. garnish 
with lettuce leaves. 

Baked Eggs. No. 3. 

Melt a tablespoonful of butter, break the number 
of eggs wanted in a plate, pour butter over each. One 
tablespoonful of cream, pepper and salt, put in oven 
and bake hard or soft as desired. 

Filled Eggs. 

Boil hard one dozen eggs, take off the shell and 
cut length-wise; take out the yolks, chop up with a 
handful of lobster meat, a few capers, seasoning; add 
a little bread, fill the eggs, place in a pan and bake. 
Serve with cream sauce. 

Fried Eggs. 

One dozen eggs, two cooking spoonfuls of butter, 
pepper and salt. Put the butter in an iron spider and 
when hot drop the eggs in one by one, sprinkle over 
them salt and pepper; when the white is set they are 
soft done. Turn them over carefully with a flat cook- 
ing spoon. Drippings or lard may be used instead of 
butter; take the eggs up on a hot platter. They are 
delicious fried in ham gravy; place them around the 
edge of the platter and the ham in the centre. 



GIUETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 99 



Boiled Eggs. 

Eggs should always be washed before boiling. If 
possible choose fresh eggs. If the skin is rough 
they will be likely to be fresh unless they are 
preserved eggs; to be nutritious, eggs should be 
boiled either soft or hard, cooked half way they 
are indigestible; it requires three minutes to cook 
them very soft; and four to boil them about right; 
cook eight or ten minutes for hard-boiled eggs; the 
yolk should be mealy not soggy. Always put them in 
boiling water and watch the clock; use an egg boiler 
if you have one, if not put the eggs in the water and 
take them out with a perforated skimmer. 

Poached Eggs. 

Six fresh eggs, six slices of toast, butter, pepper 
and salt. Use a shallow saucepan. Have the water 
boiling and salted; break the eggs one at a time and 
slip carefully into the boiling water; when all are in, 
place the pan over the fire until the white of each is 
set. Butter the toast, place an egg on each slice, 
sprinkle over pepper to taste. 

Panned Eggs. 

Make a mince meat of chopped ham, fine bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt and a little melted butter. 
Moisten to a soft paste with milk, and half fill patty 
pans; break an egg upon the top of each, dust with 
pepper and salt, and sprinkle with powdered cracker 
crumbs; Bake in an oven about eight minutes. 

Pickled Eggs. 

Boil eggs hard; after removing shell put in vine- 
gar, pepper and salt to taste. Cut length-wise to 
serve. 

Curried Fggs. 

Boil eggs hard, then cool, mix in a saucepan two 
tablespoonf u Is 6i butter and one of curry powder over a

moderate fire; put in a couple of chopped onions, and 
fry soft, add a cup or more of broth or rich gravy and 
simmer until the onion is reduced to pulp. Add to 
this a cup of cream mixed smooth with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour, let boil up and add the eggs cut in 
slices; heat through and serve hot. 



Twelve eggs, one-half pound powdered sugar, one 
and one-half pints milk; break the eggs, separate the 
yolks from the whites and beat the whites stiff; 
add the sugar and flavor with orange or vanilla; 
boil the milk with a little sugar, and the flavoring, 
when boiling drop the whites, a spoonful at a time, 
and let them drip on a strainer, take half of the milk 
and add the beaten yolks, first diluting with a little 
milk; cook and turn with wooden spoon, take off the 
fire when the whites begin to fasten, place in a dish 
and pour the cream over them carefully. — An old 
Flemish dish

to simmer a few minutes. Beat the eggs and pour 
them over the ham, put in pepper and salt, and 
scramble all together, stirring slightly with a fork. 

Scrambled Eggs with Tomatoes. 

Fve tomatoes, tablespoonful of butter, pepper and 
salt to taste, four eggs, peel the tomatoes, cut them up 
and boil them in a saucepan with the seasoning until

and milk, pepper and salt. Stir all together, beating 
one way. Melt the butter in a saucepan, pour in the 
mixture, stir until done, Serve hot, with buttered 
toast.

Omelettes. 

Care should be taken in the preparation of ome- 
lettes. The whites and yolks of the eggs should 
always be beaten separately, the tender fluffy light- 
ness so desirable in an omelette can only be obtained 
by beating the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and 
the yolks until the stringy appearance is all gone and 
they beat up lightly. Omelettes should never be 
turned, when they are done on the under side always 
set the frying pan on the grate in the oven to cook 
the top. Do not stir, shake or disturb them in any 
manner, only to slip a flat knife under the edge to see 
if the under side is browning. It is best to use lard or 
drippings in cooking them as butter burns easily. Alittle 
experience will soon enable one to make and take up 
a delicious fine looking omelette that will amply repay 
all the care used. Omelettes can be varied by using 
meat. 

Oyster Omelettes. 

One dozen small oysters, five eggs, one tablespoon- 
ful of milk; one tablespoonfulof cracker crumbs, black 
pepper, salt and one tablespoonful of butter; drain the 
oysters, use the white part and chop it fine, soak the 
crumbs in the milk and add to the well beaten yolks 
of the eggs, put in the oysters, pepper, salt and melted

Oyster Omelette No. 2 

One dozen large oysters chopped small, one half 
teaspoonful salt sprinkled on them, then let them 
stand in their own liquor half an hour; beat six eggs, 
yolks and whites separately, the former to a smooth 
paste, the latter to a stiff 'f roth; add to the yolks a 
tablespoonful of rich sweet cream, pepper and salt to 
taste, then stir in whites. Put two tablespoonfuls of 



GIUvETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. I03 



butter in a hot frying pan; when it begins to fry pour 
in your egg mixture, and add the oysters quickly; do 
not stir, but with abroad-bladed knife lift [as the eggs 
set] the omelette from the bottom of the pan, to pre- 
vent scorching; in five minutes it will be done. Place 
a hot dish, bottom upward over the omelette, and turn 
the pan over with the brown side uppermost upon the 
the dish. Serve at once. 

Meat Omelette. 

Five eggs, a teacupful of finely-chopped cold 
meat, a slice of bread, two tablespoonfuls of milk, a 
tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Soak 
the bread in the milk, beat the yolks of the eggs, melt 
the butter, stir all together, then add the meat, pepper 
and salt. Beat the white of the eggs to a froth, and 
stir in slowly. Have a frying-pan ready with butter 
in it heated. Pour in the mixture, and when done on 
the underside place in the oven for a few minutes: 
fold over on a hot platter and serve. Ham, veal, beef, 
chicken and boiled tongue are nice in this omelette. 

Individual Omelette. 

Prepare the same as meat omelette, and bake in 
large gem tins. Place the tins on the bottom of the 
oven until partly done, then put them on the grate. 
Bake slowly and do not scorch. 

Bread Omelette. 

One teacupful sweet milk, one teacupful fine bread 
crumbs without crust, salt and pepper; beat all together, 
add two well beaten eggs; put in a frying pan a small 
lump of butter, let it melt and run all over the pan; 
pour in the omelette, cook gently until it sets, loosen the 
edges and fold one half over the other; now put on a hot 
plate to fit the pan, hold firmly and turn the pan over, 
it will come out nice and whole.

Light Omelette. 

vSix eggs, one teacupful of bread crumbs, one tea- 
cupful of milk, one teaspoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of lard, pepper and salt to taste; beat the 
whites and yolks of the eggs separately, the whites to 
a stiff froth, the yolks thoroughly, pour the milk on 
the bread, mash together and add the yolks and but- 
ter, mix well together; put the lard with a pinch of 
salt into a frying pan and set it over the fire, mix lightly 
the whites with the other ingredients; and pour all the 
mixture into the frying pan; do not let it get too hot 
or it will scorch, do not stir or shake it. When the 
omelette sets, lift the edge carefully with a flat knife, 
if a light brown put the pan in the oven on the grate 
to cook the top; be careful not to cook it hard; as soon 
as the topis set it is done; take out on a platter with 
a griddle cake knife, folding it over as you do so, put 
a little butter between the folds; serve hot; this is a 
very light delicate omelette. 

Rice Omelette. 

Six eggs, three tablespoon fuls of cold boiled rice, 
two tablespoonfuls of milk, one tablespoonful of lard, 
one heaping teaspoonful of butter, pepper and salt to 
taste; mash the rice in the milk, add the butter, pep- 
per and salt, and the yolks of the eggs which should 
be thoroughly beaten; beat the whites into a stiff 
froth and stir them very lightly with the mixture; put 
the lard and a sprinkle of salt in the frying pan over 
the fire, when hot pour in the omelette, do not stir it 
when set and a very light brown on the bottom, which 
you can see by lifting the edge with a flat knife, place 
in the oven on the grate. When the top is set it is done, 
garnish with lettuce and eat with buttered toast; one 
omelette is sufficient for four persons. 

To Preserve Eggs. 

To preserve eggs pack them in crocks, with coarse 
salt. Put salt on the bottom of the jar, and then put 



GIIXETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. I05 



in a layer of eggs a little ways apart, small end down; 
fill between the eggs with salt, and put a layer on top 
of them. Continue this process until the crock is full. 

To Test Eggs. 

Put them in water, if the large end turns up they 
are not fresh; this is said to be a sure way of telling 
good eggs. If you are going to preserve eggs look at 
them through a strong light, they should be perfectly 
clear without a dark spot in them. A good way to 
tell a fresh egg is by the air bubble on the large end, 
fresh eggs will have a small air bubble; hold the egg 
up to the light or to an egg tester, turn it around 
slowly, if the bubble is a quarter of an inch deep at 
the top of the large end it should be rejected. The 
shell of a stale egg is very smooth, while fresh eggs 
have a somewhat rough shell. The contents of a 
fresh egg stick to the shell when cooked and must be 
removed with a spoon, but the shell will peel readily 
from a boiled stale egg like the skin from an orange; 
stale eggs will boil hard sooner than fresh ones; but 
it takes much longer to beat them to a froth than it 
does if they are fresh. The hand will do to test eggs 
sometimes, close the hand around the egg and hold it 
to a strong light and look through the egg; however 
the best way is to use an egg tester. 

To Make an Eg-g Tester. 

Take a box fasten the cover on with hinges, cut 
out half the front of the box in the middle, paint the 
inside a good black; then put one or two short candles 
in the middle of the opening two inches back from the 
front; light the candle and turn the box so that out- 
side light will strike it but not go in the box. Now 
examine your eggs.

VEGETABLES. 



Many housekeepers think it requires no skill to 
cook vegetables; this is a mistake. A table always 
supplied with poorly cooked vegetables indicates a 
very poor housekeeper. 

It is just as easy to acquire a proper knowledge of 
cooking food so that it will be wholesome, tempting 
and healthful, as it is to learn to cook it poorly. 

Care should always be taken in the selection of 
vegetables. All green vegetables should be freshly 
gathered; always washed in cold water, and cooked in 
boiled salted water till tender. 

Many a good dinner has been spoiled by the pota- 
toes having been cooked too much or too little. The 
cooking of potatoes is indeed an art, as they are 
used every day by almost all families ; and one cannot be 
too careful about preparing them. Be careful in 
selecting potatoes. 

Stewed Mushrooms. 

Wash the mushrooms carefully in cold water, cut- 
ting off the stalks, then pare the skin. Put a table- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan, add the mushrooms 
and a little flour; let the mushrooms cook for twenty 
minutes in their own liquor, then add pepper and salt; 
serve hot. Some add a couple of tablespoonfuls of 
rich cream to the sauce. 



108 GILI/ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 

Broiled Mushrooms. 

Pick out fine, large mushrooms, peel; wash care- 
fully and cut off the ends; lay them in melted butter, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper; then place on an oyster, 
broiler; and turn when brown. Place on buttered 
toast, pour over melted butter. Serve hot. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes, 1. 

Pint of milk; tablespoonful of butter; salt, pepper; 
teaspoonful cornstarch; six large, cold, boiled pota- 
toes. Put the milk in a frying pan; add butter pep- 
per and salt; let it boil; mix the cornstarch with a 
little cold milk; add, stirring until it thickens; cut 
the potatoes in small pieces, put all together, cook fif- 
teen minutes, stirring to prevent burning. This is a 
cheap, wholesome breakfast dish. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes, No. 2. 

Five cold, boiled potatoes; one onion; cooking- 
spoonful of butter; salt and pepper. Slice the onion 
very fine, fry in the butter until a light brown; add

Shake the sauce pan until the potatoes are hot and 
brown. A little chopped parsley may be added if 
desired. 

Potato Ribbons or Strings. 

Six potatoes; hot lard; salt. Peel the pota- 
toes, cut them in quarters, pare them round and 
round in very long ribbons; let them stand in cold 
water fifteen minutes, drain in colander; fry in the 
hot, salted lard until they are crisp and light brown; 
drain, place them on a hot platter and garnish with 
parsley. 

Potatoes Sliced. 

Six large, cold, boiled potatoes, two ounces of 
butter; one teacupful of stock; one teaspoonful of finely

ley, pepper and salt; stir over the fire until hot, add 
potatoes, simmer five minutes. Serve hot. 

Potatoes Hashed and Browned.

salt. Peel potatoes, cut in long pieces, about half the 
size of the potato, cutting them lengthwise; put in 
cold water, drying them lightly on a towel until they 
are perfectly dry. Then drop into the boiling lard 
which has been salted. Stir them often; when they 
are a nice light brown, take them out with a skim- 
mer. They will be crisp and not greasy. 

Fried Potatoes. 

Pare the potatoes, then slice them thin, of a uni- 
form size, let them stand fifteen minutes in frying 
pan with the butter and salt, (nice beef drippings will 
do instead of butter.) Covei and occasionally turn 
them; when they are tender and of a light brown 
color they are done. 

Duchess Potatoes. 

Take six large potatoes; after they are peeled, cut 
in little round balls with a potato cutter, steam till 
tender; put some milk in skillet, about half full, little 
butter, pepper and salt to taste, tablespoonful chopped 
parsley, thicken with tablespoonful flour dissolved in 
water, then add the potatoes. This makes a very 
nice dish.

with the flour dissolved in a little cold milk; simmer 
a few minutes until done. 

Saratoga Chips. 

Pare three medium-sized potatoes, and cut in 
very thin slices, (with a cutter would be best) over a 
pan of water, so that they will drop at once into 
water, which makes them light and dry after being

and pepper. Boil the potatoes and mash them while 
hot; beat the egg and melt the butter; stir the pota- 
toes and add butter pepper and salt. Make into flat

meat, or served in a separate dish. 

Roast Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash well potatoes of a uniform size, being care- 
ful not to cut them; let stand about a half hour in a 
moderately hot oven, serve immediately. These are 
very nice roasted on a hot hearth, or in a Dutch oven, 
same as common potatoes. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Pick out several even-sized potatoes, wash thor- 
oughly, being careful not to cut them. Place in 
kettle of boiling water; when done drain carefully 



giiaett's magic cook book. 113 



and remove the corner of the lid, so the steam will all 
disappear. By so doing they will be mealy and dry. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. 

Take four or five good-sized sweet potatoes, slice 
thin; have the hot lard ready; drop them in, sprink- 
ling well with pepper and salt; brown first one side 
and then the other. These should be served hot.

and are prepared the same as the above recipe. 

Summer Squash. 

Cut the squash in pieces, take out the seeds and 
pare, unless the squash is very tender; boil or stew 
until soft; drain through a cheese-cloth bag, return 
to saucepan and season, mash all together, stir the 
butter in thoroughly and serve hot.

Take one-half a squash, cut in pieces, take out 
seeds and pare as thin as possible, boil or steam until 
tender in salted water; when done, drain thoroughly 
through a colander, return to saucepan, mash and

should be dry and mealy. 



Il6 GIIv^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



Winter Squash Baked. 

Select a green hubbard squash, cut in pieces about 
five inches square, put on the grate in the oven and 
bake; it requires about as much time to bake as sweet 
potatoes and should be served immediately. 

Green Corn. 

Sweet corn is the best, the grain should be full, 
but the milk should not be hard. It should be cooked 
on the same day it is gathered; it loses its sweetness 
in a few hours, and must be artificially supplied. 
Strip off the husks, pick out the silk, and put in 
boiling water; if not entirely fresh, add a tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, but no salt. Boil quickly twenty minutes, 
and serve; or you may cut it from the cob, put in 
plenty of "butter, a litfle salt, and serve. 

Escalloped Corn. 

Cover the bottom of a dish with canned corn; put 
in a layer of bread crumbs; pepper, salt and butter to 
taste; then another layer of corn, covering with bread 
crumbs; seasoning and butter; add milk enough to 
make it moist and put in oven; bake. 

Green Corn Pudding. 

Twelve ears of sweet corn, one quart of sweet 
milk, four eggs; teaspoonful of salt, tablespoonful of 
butter. Grate the corn and stir in the milk and salt;

quarters of an hour. 

Corn Oysters. 

One teacupful flour, one-half teacupful melted 
butter, three tablespoonfuls milk, two teaspoonfuls 
salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper, one pint grated 
corn. Pour on the flour and beat well; then add the 
other ingredients and beat rapidly for three minutes.

in the batter by the spoonful. Fry about five minutes. 

Baked Corn. 

Grate eight large ears of corn, half a pint of milk, 
two eggs; salt and pepper to taste; one tablespoonful 
each of sugar and butter. Beat eggs light, add milk, 
grated corn, sugar, salt, and melted butter. Bake in 
an earthen dish until a light brown. 

Green Corn Stewed. 

One dozen ears of sweet corn, one teacupful of 
water, one tablespoonful of butter, one teacupful of 
milk or cream, salt and pepper to taste; cut the corn 
from the ears with a sharp knife; do not cut close to 
cob; after cutting, scrape the cob with the knife to 
take off the remainder of the corn without the hull; 
put the corn and cold water into a double saucepan or 
pail placed into a kettle of boiling water, and boil 
twenty minutes; when done, season with butter, milk 
or cream, pepper and salt; if the corn is not fresh, add 
a tablespoonful of sugar. 

Green Corn Cakes. 

Six ears of sweet corn, one teacupful of milk, one 
egg, one teaspoonful of salt, flour enough for batter, 
pepper to taste.; grate the corn, beat the egg and stir 



Il8 GIIvIyETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 

the ingredients all together, adding flour enough to 
make a batter; bake on griddle as you would ordinary 
griddle cakes. 

Green Corn Cakes No. 2. 

Two teacupfuls of grated green corn, one teaeup- 
ful of flour, half a teacupful of milk, half a teacupfnl 
of melted butter, one egg, teaspoonful of salt, pepper 
to taste; stir all together, beating well, except the 
egg, which should be added last, partly beaten; drop 
a spoonful at a time on buttered tins and bake ten or 
fifteen minutes, or fry, or bake on griddles. 

Succotash. 

One pint of sweet corn cut, from the cob, half a 
pint of lima beans; one teacupful of milk or cream, 
one tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper. Pick all 
the silk from the ears, and cut the corn from the cob, 
cut only a little over half through the kernel, and 
scrape the rest from the cob with the knife; this saves 
the juicy sweetness without the hull. Put the corn 
and beans in a kettle and cover with water, adding 
salt. Boil until the beans are tender; when done put 
in the milk or cream, butter and pepper. 

Ragout of Peas. 

Take one quart of dry, green peas; teacupful of 
turnips cut very fine, same of carrots. Soak peas over 
night; boil in same water as soaked in; salt and pep- 
to taste. Mix one tablespoonful of flour with same 
amount of butter. Cook until vegetables are tender. 

Green Peas. 

Put one pint of shelled peas into boiling salted 
water if young, boil half an hour, older ones need a 
longer time; when done,pour off the water, add one tea- 
cupful of milk, tablespoonful butter, pepper; set on the 



GILIvETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 119 



stove and boil slowly, dissolve one teaspoonful of flour 
in a little cold milk and stir in as soon as they com- 
mence to boil; cream may be used instead of milk 
and flour. 

To Cook Canned Peas. 

Drain off all the liquor from a can of peas, put into 
a saucepan, add a good sized piece of butter, plenty of 
pepper and salt; when thoroughly heated, serve; 
cream or milk may be added if so desired. 

Ripe Peas. 

One quart of peas, one tablespoonful of butter, salt 
and pepper to taste; soak the peas over night, then 
boil in salted water until done, season with butter and 
pepper; split ripe peas are very nice to use in pea 
soup also. 

Puree of Peas. 

Two small cans peas, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one bay leaf, two teacupfuls of milk, two teacupfuls 
water, a small onion, one tablespoonful flour or corn, 
starch, pepper, salt, cloves, parsley to taste; wash the 
peas carefully in cold water, cook about a half-hour 
until almost dry. Press through a colander, put on 
the milk in a rice boiler, adding tj^fr bay leaf, 
onion, cloves and parsley, then rub traf^butter and 
flour or cornstarch until smooth, strain the milk, add 
the peas; stir in the butter and flour until it boils 
and thickens, lastly adding the pepper and salt; this 
makes an excellent soup; Lima or other beans may be 
made into a puree the same way. 

Hygenic Baked Beans. 

One quart beans, three quarts water; soak six 
hours, boil in same water three hours; one-half cup 
cream or butter; salt; then bake one hour. 



GIU,ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



String' Beans. 

One quart of beans, tablespoonful of butter, tea- 
cupful of milk, salt and pepper to taste. Cut off both 
ends of the bean, and string carefully; it spoils them 
to leave the strings on. Cut the beans in small 
pieces and let lie in cold water half an hour; drain, 
and put in boiling, salted water. They require 
considerable boiling, about an hour, at least. Cook 
till tender, as this is a very unwholesome vegetable 
when underdone. Pour off the water, add milk and 
pepper, then let boil a minute; serve. They are nice 
seasoned with butter and no milk. 

Butter Beans. 

One quart of beans, teacupful cream or milk, tea- 
spoonful salt, tablespoonful butter, pepper. String 
carefully and wash, cut in small pieces and 
throw in cold water a little while. Boil in 
salted water, cook two hours or more, unless 
very tender and young. When thoroughly cooked, 
pour off the water, and season with cream or milk 
and pepper. 

Lima Beans. 

Quart lima beans shelled, tablespoonful of butter, 
salt and pepper. Look over the beans and let them 
lie in cold water half an hour, then put them in a 
saucepan of boiling water, with salt and cook until 
tender. Drain, and add butter and pepper. Soak 
ripe lima beans several hours and cook the same as 
green beans. 

Lima Beans, No. 2. 

Pint of beans, half a pint of milk, teaspoonful of 
butter, half a teaspoonful of flour, salt and pepper. 
Cook as above, drain; heat the milk to boiling; add

beans and let stand a few minutes. 



GIXI/ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 121 



Boston Baked Beans. 

One quart of white beans, half a pound of salt 
pork, one tablespoonful of New Orleans molasses, salt 
and pepper to taste; pick over the beans carefully, 
then wash thoroughly, soak over night in water 
enough to cover them; parboil twice, the first time 
put over in cold water and drain it off as soon as it 
begins to boil; the second time, put them in boiling 
water, boil only a few minutes, drain through a col- 
ander; then wash the pork and boil with the beans; 
some beans will soften in a few minutes, while others 
require an hour or more; do not allow the skin to 
break, but as soon as the hardness is gone, pour the 
beans and liquor into the bean jar, add the molasses 
and pepper; salt if necessary. Place the pork on top, 
and bake in a moderate oven ten or twelve hours. 
It may be necessary to add water occasionally, and 
be sure to keep the jar covered on top.

serve hot. 



Creamed Carrots. 

Pare five large carrots, cut them into strips; put 
them into a saucepan with salt and boiling water.

ful of milk, a little butter and pepper. As soon as 
the milk begins to boil, stir in the flour dissolved in 
cold milk.

Beets. 

Wash the beets carefully in several waters. Do 
not scrape or cut the skin, as it spoils the taste and 
color to let them bleed. Salt the water and put in 
the beets: boil until thoroughly cooked. Old beets 
take a much longer time to cook than young ones, 
which requires from one hour and a half to two hours. 
When done put in a pan of* cold water and take off 
the skin with the hand; cut in slices. Boil the vine- 
gar, add the butter and pepper and pour over the 
beets. 

Beet Greens.

they are very nice for greens. Wash very carefully, 
rejecting the wilted ones. Put in boiling salted water 
with half a pound of salt pork. Boil one hour, drain, 
cut the leaves, garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
slices, and pickled beets sliced. The pork may be left

with the salt, no water; when cooked, add cream, 
butter, pepper and sift in the crumbs, stirring slowly 
(the cream should be put in a little at a time) ; toma- 
toes should never be cooked in tin dishes as the acid 
eats the tin and makes the tomatoes unwholesome. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Hard, ripe tomatoes, fine bread or cracker crumbs, 
salt, pepper and butter; cut the tomatoes in slices half 
an inch thick, without peeling, mix salt and pepper 
with the bread crumbs, dip each piece tomato in the

BREAD, BISCUIT, ROLLS, ETC. 



'Tell me where is fancy bred," 

Sang the Bard of Avon. 
Htw is life most nourished ? 

Ne'er so thrives it save on 
Bread that's made with Magic Yeast, 
Health promoter at life's feast. 



Bread-Making. 

In order to make good bread, the quality of yeast must 
be good ; you can always depend on Magic Yeast. The 
lightness or fermentation of the dough must be 
watched, also the heat of the oven. 

In bread -making, care should be taken to always 
have the pan, jar or bowl in which the bread is raised, 
perfectly sweet and clean. The molding board, roll- 
ing pin and other utensils should also be kept clean. 
The best yeast and flour should be used, and pains 
taken in mixing and kneading. Always sift the flour 
once or twice, that there may be no lumps in the 
bread. It should be lightly kneaded towards the cen- 
ter of the mass, and care should be taken not to dis- 
turb it while it is rising. 

While rising, bread should be kept at an even tem- 
perature, if possible do not let it get hot or cold. 

Do not mix bread too stiff- it is best to have it as 



138 GIU^TT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



soft as possible to knead it; do not put flour in when 
kneading for pans; enough should be put in the first 
time. 

As bread is the main article of food in many fami- 
lies, much depends on its quality. If it is good and 
wholesome, it is healthful and nutritious; if hard or 
soggy, it is very injurious. 

Brown bread is a very healthful article of diet, 
and should be used as freely as wheat bread. 

Raised biscuit are a pleasant change from bread, 
and equally nutritious. 

Hot bread and hot biscuit are considered un- 
healthy, but light, flaky baking powder biscuit eaten 
occasionally, are as healthy as any other article of diet 
eaten hot. For we generally eat potatoes and all other 
kinds of vegetables, as well as most meats just as they 
come from the kitchen stove. 

Gems, muffins, griddle cakes and waffles also re- 
quire care in the mixing; they are healthful, and a 
good substitute for bread, and abundantly repay all 
the time bestowed in acquiring the art of making 
them. 

To make good bread is indeed an art; a careless 
putting together of ingredients will not do, as alas, 
too many young housekeepers have found to their dis- 
may. Time, heat, patience, experience, all enter into 
good bread-making. 

Bread No. 1. 

Soak one cake Magic Yeast in a teacupful of luke- 
warm water, take three quarts sifted flour in bread pan, 
add one tablespoonful each, salt, sugar and lard; mix 
with two quarts lukewarm water, add yeast, knead thor- 
oughly, and set in moderately warm place to rise over 
night; knead into loaves in morning and bake in slow 
oven. 

Bread No. 2. 

Put a cake of Magic Yeast to soak in a teacupful of 
lukewarm water; wash, pare and grate two medium 



GIU<ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. I39 

sized potatoes in bread bowl, stir in one* pint of boil- 
ing water, let stand a few minutes, then add flour, then 
the dissolved yeast; stir well; let raise; before going 
to bed take three pints water, all the flour you can 
beat in, let rise over night; in the morning take one 
pint of warm water, (or more) and salt enough; stir 
in all the flour you can, let rise, then knead, rise, or 
make into loaves. Don't mix all the sponge at once, but 
take it in quarters, (it is easier work) ; use flour enough 
to keep from sticking to kneading board. This makes 
six good sized loaves. Don't have to wait till after- 
noon to bake it, (bound to come up) Magic Yeast dis- 
solves so quickly you don't have to boil and mash 
potatoes, and have a dozen things to wash, and besides 
you lose half the good of the potatoes, and boiled 
potatoes sour quicker than baked. 

Good Bread No. 1. 

Take two to three quarts flour, place in a large 
pan; add two tablespoonfuls of white sugar, one-half 
teaspoonful of fine salt, and a piece of good butter 
about the size of a small egg; rub well together; soak 
one-half cake of Magic Yeast in a teacupful of luke- 
warm water until dissolved; with this, mix a little 
sponge in the center of the pan of flour; let this stand 
an hour or more, until well raised, then mix with a 
pint of scalded milk, to which has been added one 
boiled mashed potato. The dough should not be too 
stiff, but free from the sides of the pan while being 
kneaded. After finishing, cover the dough with but- 
ter to prevent it from hardening and cracking; set in 
a warm place and let stand for several hours, then cut 
and knead into loaves, and place in pans; these should 
be set in a warm place; bake in moderately hot oven 
from three-quarters to one hour; when done, set up so 
as to allow the steam to escape. In no case should a 
cloth be thrown over hot bread, as it toughens the 
crust. 



140 GII^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



Good Bread No. 2. 

One cake Magic Yeast, one quart of flour, one cook- 
ing spoonful of lard, one tablespoonful of sugar, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-half pint of warm water. Soak 
the yeast in warm water about half an hour, then add 
lard, sugar and salt with the flour, then the rest of the 
water; knead into dough until it blisters, which will 
take from fifteen to twenty minutes; then put into a 
greased bowl; let it rise five or six hours, then make 
into rolls; let them rise about an hour and a half, 
then bake in a quick oven. If for loaves, they will 
require two hours for the second rising, and a more 
moderate oven for baking. 

Bread— Mrs. C. B. Ely, Cleveland, No. 3. 

Two quarts flour, one tablespoonful lard, one tea- 
spoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, one pint luke- 
warm water, one Magic Yeast cake. Mix salt, sugar, 
the water and a little of the flour together, adding the 
yeast, which has been softened in one-half cup of 
warm water. Keep one cup of flour to use in the 
morning. Place the rest of the flour in the bread 
bowl, which should be of earthen, not tin; stir the 
mixture, (which consists of salt, sugar, lard, yeast; 
water and a little flour) into the centre of the flour a 
little at a time, until it is all in. Stir well, and leave 
the flour at the sides, to be worked in, in the morning. 

Bread. 

One cake Magic Yeast, five good sized potatoes, 
three pints warm water, as much flour as necessary. 
This will make four loaves. Set a sponge at night as 
follows: Boil and mash the potatoes, put them into 
the bread-pan, add three pints of warm water or milk, 
and a cake of Magic Yeast, softened in a little warm 
water, and enough sifted flour to make a rather stiff 
batter, and set in a warm place over night. In the 
morning mix as early as possible, adding flour to make 



GILLETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 141 



a soft dough, but must not stick to the pan; knead 
thoroughly; then let rise twice the size it was when you 
stopped kneading; press the dough down in the pan, 
and when it again becomes light, make into four 
loaves, and put in baking pans. Let the loaves rise 
twice their original size; use a little soda if needed 
when mixing the bread in the morning; set the sponge 
at five in the evening, mix at ten, mold into loaves 
early in the morning. 

Delicious Bread. 

One cake Magic Yeast, six quarts flour, two coffee- 
cupfuls indian meal, two tablespoonfuls salt. Dissolve 
a cake of Magic Yeast in a teacupful of lukewarm water; 
sift flour in pan; add Indian meal, salt, and stir all 
together; make a hole in middle, pour in lukewarm 
water, add yeast and make pretty thick sponge; let it 
rise till light; mix in morning; it will be light if in a 
warm place in three hours. Mix the flour in your pan 
in the sponge, not so much but that it will be soft; 
take out, mold and knead a few minutes; put in 
greased pans and set in warm place to rise; when it 
cracks on top it is ready for the oven. You can see the 
cracks by holding up the pan and looking across it. 

Magic Bread. 

One Magic Yeast cake, three pints warm water or 
milk, flour enough to knead; soak a, Magic Yeast cake 
for half an hour in a pint of warm (not hot) water, 
then stir in enough flour to make a batter, cover and 
set in a warm place to rise. When light add one quart 
of warm water (or scalded milk and water) and flour 
enough to make a batter; beat all briskly for fifteen 
minutes (beat, not stir) set again in »a warm place to 
rise, (usually over night) ; when light add flour until 
it does not stick to the board; knead well, set in a 
warm place and when light mold into loaves; bake in 
a moderate oven, from three-quarters to one hour.

er have your flour warm, and keep the sponge in a 
warm place when rising. A gentle, even warmth is 
necessary to make good bread. Dont let it get chilled. 

French Bread. 

One cake Magic Yeast, one quart water, teaspoonful 
salt, one-half teaspoonful ginger, one-half teacupful 
sugar, six large potatoes. Tie a small tablespoonful 
hops in a muslin bag, put it in a quart of cold water on 
the stove, let the water boil three minutes then re 
move the hops. Have ready the potatoes boiled and 
mashed fine, mix the potatoes with three teacupfuls of 
flour, until smooth; pour the hot water when boiling, 
gradually over the mixture of flour and potatoes, and 
stir until free from lumps; add the sugar, salt and

to rise; in the morning mix in a half teaspoonful soda 
dissolved in a tablespoonful warm water; mix, add 
enough flour to make a smooth dough, but do not add 
any more while kneading. If the dough sticks to your 
hands, wet them in lukewarm water; after kneading a 
few minutes, stretch the dough and fold it back, al- 
ways kneading and folding it in the same direction, to 
keep the grain of the bread from breaking, Repeat 
this process for half an 'hour; cover and set in a warm 
place; when light sprinkle a little flour on board; take 
enough dough for a loaf, gather into a round loaf with- 
out molding, press the rolling pin across the center, 
pushing the dough on each side of pin, roll each side 
towards the centre, lap carefully; turn the loaf over 
and stretch it to give the long form, lay the loaves on 
flat tins that have been sprinkled with flour; when 
light bake half an hour in quick oven.

pour Tomato sauce over it and serve immediately. 

Fondue. 

Put into a small saucepan one tablespoonful but- 
ter, one tablespoonful flour; stir over the fire until 
they bubble, then add one gill of milk or cream, stir 
well to prevent burning; when smooth, stir into it 
three ounces of finely-grated cheese of a fine quality, 
a scant saltspoonful of salt and a tiny pinch of cay- 
enne; turn it into a bowl and stir into it the beaten 
yolks of two eggs; thoroughly whisk the whites of 
three eggs solid; stir them in very gently the last 
thing. Butter a silver chafing dish and pour the 
fondue into it. Bake a golden brown in a quick oven.

Cheese Straws. 

Mix four tablespoonfuls flour with one large tea- 
spoonful butter, add four tablespoonfuls of grated 
cheese; mix well, as you would for pie crust; season 
with one-half teaspoonful salt and pinch of pepper; 
mix all together and wet with one egg, and roll out 
very thin, about like pie crust; sprinkle grated cheese 
over and roll, and cut in long, narrow strips. Bake 
in moderate oven a light brown. 

Cheese Toast. 

Toast nice thin slices of bread crispy and brown; 
put on a warmed plate, allowing a piece to a person, 
and pour over it melted cheese. Serve while warm, 
and a little prepared mustard may be put on the toast 
before adding the cheese if so desired. New cheese 
is the best to melt.

cupful bread crumbs soaked in one pint of sweet milk; 
beat the whites and yolks separately; little butter and 
salt. Bake one-half hour.

Schmier Kase. 

Some call it cottage cheese. It is made from clab- 
bered milk. Take the cream off the top of a pan of 
thick sour milk, let it stand in a warm place on the 
back part of the range, and pour over it a couple of 
quarts of boiling water; pour into a bag and let it 
drain, and hang up over night. When ready to use 
it, mix some rich cream, salt and pepper, and serve in 
ball shape. 

Welsh Rarebit. 

One-fourth pound rich cream cheese, one-fourth 
teacupful cream or milk, one teaspoonful mustard, 
one-half teaspoonful salt, a few grains of cayenne, one 
egg, one teaspoonful butter, four slices toast. Break 
the cheese in small pieces, put into milk in farina 
boiler, toast the bread and keep it hot. Mix mustard, 
salt and pepper, add eggs, and beat well; when cheese 
is melted, stir in the egg and butter, and cook two 
minutes, or until it thickens a little, but do not let it 
curdle; pour over the toast. Many use ale instead of 
cream. 

Welsh Rarebit. No. 2. 

Toast four slices of bread, spread with mustard 
moistened with a little hot water. Melt in a pan one- 
half pound cheese, with a little piece of butter. When 
melted, pour over the bread.

ter the size of a hickorynut, yolks of three eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls cornstarch, one tablespoonful flour, 
stick of cinnamon one inch long, one-half teaspoonful 
Gillett's Double Extract of Vanilla. Put the cinnamon 
into the milk, and when it is just about to boil 
stir in the sugar and the cornstarch and flour, 
the two latter rubbed smooth with a little cold 



GII^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 163 



milk. Stir it over the fire for fully two minutes 
to cook well with the starch and flour. Then take 
off the stove and stir in the beaten yolks of the 
eggs, and return it a few moments to set them. Now, 
again taking it from the fire, remove the cinna- 
mon, stir in the butter and vanilla, and pour it 
into an oblong buttered tin an inch high. When cold 
and stiff, cut the pudding into parallelograms, about 
three inches long and two wide, roll in cracker 
crumbs, stir in eggs (slightly beaten and sweetened), 
then again in the crumbs, dip in hot lard; when nice 
color take out, place in oven five minutes to soften 
the pudding; sprinkle sugar on top.

PASTRY AND PIES. 



Rules to be Observed in Making' Pies. 

Do not use flavors or spices in fruit pies; they 
spoil the flavor. 

Never make pies of juicy fruits without flouring 
the fruit. 

Custard, cocoanut, cranberry, cream, lemon, mer- 
ingue and apple meringue, require only one crust. 

Always wet the edges of the under crust of two 
crust pies with water, or flour and water, before put- 
ting on the upper crust; it will make them adhere to- 
gether and prevent the juice from boiling out. Always 
cut a slit or figure in the upper crust to allow the 
steam to escape. 

Prepare the fruit for the pies, then gather to- 
gether everything necessary ready for use; wipe the 
molding board and rolling-pin; grease either tins or 
plates (plates are nicest); have the sugar and spice- 
box handy. Then make the piecrust and roll it out 
immediately. The oven should be a hot, even tem- 
perature, and should be ready before you make your 
pies. Do not cool your pies quickly; they should be 
allowed to stand where they will cool gradually. 
Fruit pies are nicest made the same day they are to be 
used. It always shows a nicety of housekeeping to 
sift a little sugar .over the top of pies when they are 



166 GILLETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



taken from the oven. Do not allow pies to stand on 
pie-tins; it spoils the under crust. 

Use three-fourths as much butter by weight as 
you do flour; mix in lightly with as little water as 
possible. If you do not mix the butter in thoroughly 
the paste will be flaky and rich. Good for patties. 

Pie Crust No. 1. 

Four teacupfuls of flour, one teacupful and a half 
of lard, half a teacupful of water, half a teaspoonful 
of salt; sift the flour, mix in the salt and rub in the 
lard until it will form a ball when held tightly in the 
hand; then mix with the water. The lard should be 
cold and hard, and use cold, not ice-water. Do not 
mold or knead the dough, but squeeze it lightly 
together; cut off enough for one crust at a time and 
roll out gently. Many prefer butter to lard. It will 
require two teacupfuls of butter to four of flour. This 
is preferable to puff paste for nearly every kind of 
pastry. 

Pie Crust No. 2. 

Sift the flour, add a little salt, use a third as much 
lard as flour, by measure; rub the flour in the lard and 
mix with as little cold water as possible. Squeeze the 
dough together (do not mold or knead it), cut off 
enough for one crust at a time and roll out lightly; 
have the lard cold and hard, and use cold, not ice 
water. This crust is better than the crust with the 
lard rolled in. 

Custard Pie. 



One pint ot milk, three eggs, half a teacupful of 
white sugar, half a teaspoonful of Gillett's Double 
Extract of Vanilla. Line your pieplate with paste. 
Beat the eggs well, add sugar, etc., and pour on the 
crust and bake immediately in a moderate oven. Do 
not allow it to boil or it will be spoiled, as it will cur- 
dle or whey. It should be slightly tinted when done. 



GIIvUETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 167 



Custard Fie No. 2. 

Three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
milk enough to fill the pieplate; beat the yolks of the 
eggs thoroughly, add the sugar and milk and stir to- 
gether, then add the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
froth, mix well together, and put in a deep pieplate 
lined with a rich pie paste, sprinkle a little cinnamon 
over the top, and bake in a moderate oven. The cus- 
tard must not boil. This pie is nice flavored with 
Gillett's Double Extract of Vanilla. 

Rhubarb or Pie Plant Pie. 

Wash the rhubarb, peel off the skin and cut in 
small pieces, the smaller the better, line pieplates or 
tins with crust, sprinkle flour over the rhubarb and lay 
it in the crust, cover thickly with sugar and sprinkle 
with flour; then roll out the upper crust, cut one long 
and several small gashes in it, wet the edge of the 
under crust and cover the pie with upper; press the 
edges together, mark with a fork and bake in a mod- 
erate oven. 

Raspberry Pie. 

Look over the berries carefully, do not wash them; 
line a deep pie tin or plate with crust, fill with the 
berries, sift over a little flour and cover with sugar, 
wet the edge of the crust with cold water, roll out and 
gash the upper crust and lay it over the berries, pinch 
the edges gently together, taking care that they ad- 
here firmly, and bake in a moderately hot oven. 

Blackberry Pie. 

Look over the berries carefully and have them 
ready before the crust is rolled out. Dust them with 
flour before putting them in the pie, roll out the crust, 
put a little sugar in the bottom of the crust before 
putting in the berries, then cover with sugar. 



l68 GILIvETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



Blackberry Pie No. 2. 

Look over the berries carefully and dust them 
with two tablespoonfuls of flour for each pie, roll out 
the crust and line a deep pie tin or plate, put in a lit- 
tle sugar before you do the berries, heap the berries 
toward the middle and cover with sugar, use a teacup- 
ful of sugar for each pie, wet the edge of the under 
crust before putting on the upper, break off the crust 
carefully with the fingers instead of cutting with a 
knife, and pinch the two carefully together, being 
sure they adhere, mark with a fork, cut gashes in the 
upper crust before putting it on the pie. 

Apple Pie. 

For pies use only sour, juicy apples; peel and cut 
them in thin slices, grease the tins, roll out the under 
crust and lay in the sliced apples. If the apples are 
very sour put in enough granulated sugar to cover 
them; if medium apples, less sugar will do; (for fine 
flavored apples do not use cinnamon,nutmeg or butter.) 
The most delicious pies are made of the pure fruit 
and sugar. Wet the edge of the lower crust before 
putting on the upper crust, pinch both carefully to- 
gether until they adhere, then with a fork mark the 
edges. 

Strawberry Pie. 

Pick over and wash the berries, if they are sandy, 
and drain through a colander, roll out a crust and put 
it in a buttered pie tin, put in the berries, cover with 
sugar, sift over about a tablespoonful of flour and 
cover with the top crust which has been perforated 
with holes or cut in a fancy figure. Be very careful 
about the crusts adhering together; wet the under 
crust with cold water before putting on the upper; 
mark with a fork. Butter may be added, but will 
spoil the flavor. 



GIL^ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 169 



Mince Pie. 

Three pounds of cold boiled lean beef, twice the 
amount of sour apples, three pounds of raisins, two 
pounds of English currants, half a pound of suet, half 
a pound of citron, two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
pounds of sugar, one pint of cider vinegar, one pint of 
New Orleans molasses, a teaspoonful each of ground 
cloves, cinnamon, mace, and black pepper, one nutmeg, 
two tablespoonfuls salt. Mince the meat fine, chop 
the apples, stone and partially chop the raisins, care- 
fully wash and dry the currants, cut the citron in fine 
pieces, chop the suet and melt the butter. Use twice as 
many chopped apples by measure as you do meat. Mix 
all together thoroughly, put it in a porcelain kettle and 
scald. If the mince meat is too dry, add a little warm 
water when you use it. More seasoning can be used 
if preferred. Make a rich paste and bake with two 
crusts in pie tins. These pies will keep several days 
in winter; take them off the tins and freeze them or 
keep them in a cool place. Can this mince meat, or, 
in the winter, cover in a crock and put it in a cold 
place to freeze. 

Washington Pie. 

Two eggs and one teacupful of sugar well beaten 
together, a pinch of salt, four tablespoonfuls of cold 
water, three teaspoonfuls of Gillett's Baking Powder 
sifted into a teacupful of flour; bake, and when cold, 
split and spread with a cream made of one egg, one- 
half teacupful of ginger, one teacupful of sweet milk 
and one teaspoonful of corn starch; flavor with Gil- 
letts' Double Extract of Vanilla or Lemon to suit the 
taste. 

Lemon Pie. 

Two eggs, one teacupful of sugar, one lemon, two

170 GIIyl.ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



out all the juice. A lemon squeezer is the best thing 
to squeeze lemons with. Beat the yolks of the eggs, 
add the sugar, lemon and flour which has been dis- 
solved in a little of the water. Stir all together to a 
cream and add the water gradually; use a pinch of 
salt. Line a deep pieplate with nice, rich crust, pinch 
the edge into a high cup shape so that it will stand 
up above the plate, pour in the custard and bake in a 
moderately hot oven; when done, cover with a frost- 
ing made of the whites of the eggs and two table- 
spoonfuls of pulverized sugar; put the pie in the oven 
a few minutes to cook the frosting; it should be 
slightly tinted. 

Lemon Pie. No. 2. 

Line a deep pan with a rich paste, and for filling 
use the juice and rind of one lemon, four eggs (leave 
out the whites of three), one teacupful sugar, three- 
fourths teacupful of cold water, one tablespoonful 
flour, butter half the size of an egg. Dissolve the 
flour in the water, then stir in the sugar, beaten eggs, 
etc. After the mixture is in the crust, cut up the 
butter in little bits and put it around the pie. After 
all is baked, beat up the whites with a little sugar, 
spread on top and brown a little. 

Lemon Mince Pie. 

One lemon, one egg, one teacupful of sugar, one 
teacupful of raisins, one teacupful of cold water, two 
teacupfuls of flour, one teaspocnful of butter, a pinch

sugar, flour and water, stone and chop the raisins, 
melt the butter, beat the egg thoroughly and stir all 
the ingredients together. Bake with two crusts. 
When done, sift powdered sugar over the pie while it 
is warm. This is an old, well-tried recipe, and a very 
nice pie. 



GILLETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 171 



Cherry Pie. 

Have the paste ready, the cherries pitted and 
everything handy; then roll out the under crust and 
spread it on a greased pie tin or plate (a deep earthen 
pie plate is best); sprinkle a little flour and sugar over 
the crust, dust two tablespoonfuls of flour over the 
cherries and put them in the crust, cover them with 
white sugar and wet the edges of the crust with flour 
and water. Roll out the upper crust, cut one long and 
several short gashes in it and put it on the pie, pinch

GIU,ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 173 



pie tin or plate with rich crust, form the edge into a 
cup shape, so that it .will hold the custard. If dedi- 
cated cocoanut is used, it should be soaked in milk 
several hours. Beat the yolks to a froth and add 
sugar, milk, etc.; lastly add the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a foam, stir in lightly and put into the crust.

ding use a quart of Morella cherries, which are very 
juicy and sour, meantime put a pound of granulated 
sugar over the fire with a gill of cold water, and let it 
boil. When the cherries are stoned put them into the 
sugar and boil them just tender, only for a few min- 
utes, but do not let them break. After adding the 
cherries to the boiling sugar, stir two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of corn starch with a teacup nearly full of 
cold water; stir that into the cherries, and stir the 
mixture often enough to prevent burning until it has 
boiled sufficiently to thicken; upon cooling pour it

Rule for Making Custard. 

A tablespoonful of sugar to each egg, and five 
eggs to a quart of milk is the rule always observed in 
making custard, etc. Always beat the yolks and 
whites of eggs separately, the yolks and sugar to- 
gether and add the whites the last thing. With this 
rule for a basis a great variety of delicious custards 
and puddings can be made. In making boiled custards 
a double stew pan or two pans, one smaller than the 
other, should always be used.- Put the water in the 
larger pan and when it boils place the tin containing 
the custard in it. To put eggs in hot milk mix the 
eggs first with a small quantity of cold milk, and add 
them gradually to the hot milk. Do not boil custards, 
but heat to nearly boiling point until- the eggs are 
set. Baked custards require a moderate oven. If they 
are allowed to boil the milk will whey, and n the cus- 
tards are not nice; most puddings made of eggs and 
milk follow the same rule. If economy in eggs is 
desired, one tablespoonful of flour or heaping tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch will be found a good substitute 
for an egg. 

Boiled Custard. 

One quart of milk, five eggs, four tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, a pinch of salt. Beat the eggs thoroughly, 
add sugar, milk and a teaspoonful of Gillett's 
vanilla extract; put in a pail or pan, and set in a large 
pan of boiling water. When set and stiff, it is done; 
pour into the dish in which it is to be served and 
sprinkle over jt a tablespoonful of powdered sugar.

to remain on stove until perfectly dissolved, then re- 
move and place in a basin; place in a pan of cold 
water, add the juice of one lemon; when cold and it 
begins to thicken, add the stiffly beaten whites of four 
eggs; beat all together until it becomes liquid enough 
to pour into a mold. Serve next day with whipped 
cream or custard.

BEVERAGES. 



Chocolate. 



Five tablespoonfuls of scraped chocolate, one 
quart of milk, one quart of boiling water, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Dissolve the chocolate in a little 
boiling water, set the milk and water over the fire 
and as soon as it comes to a boil put in the dissolved 
chocolate and add the sugar, boil a few minutes and it 
is ready to serve. This amount of sugar may be too 
much for some people; less is required for sweet choc- 
late. 

Cocoa and Cocoa Nibs are made in the same way. 
It should always be served hot, a little cold milk is 
often added at the table. This is a very healthful 
drink; it is good for children and nervous people. It 
is also nutritious and exhilarating.

Russian Tea. 

Pare and slice good juicy lemons and lay a piece 
in the bottom of each cup, sprinkle with white sugar 
and pour hot strong tea upon it. Do not use cream. 

Lime Water. 

This is easily made at home by taking a piece of 
unslacked lime the size of a walnut, and putting it 
into two quarts of filtered water in an earthern vessel 
and stirring it thoroughly; allow it to settle and pour 
off the clear solution as required for use, replacing 
with water and stirring up as consumed. This is useful 
in certain acid conditions of the stomach, and is often 
called for in treating infants. 

Sweet Whey. 

To a pint of milk add about a square inch of ren- 
net and slowly warm to about one hundred degrees 
Fahr., stand for thirty minutes and then strain through 
muslin. 

Grape Juice. 

To every five pounds of grapes, one pound of su- 
gar and one quart of hot water; let it just come to a 
boil, put through a crash towel bag; take pulp that 
remains in bag, put in a dish and put one quart water 
to wash all juice, then drain in bag and add sugar, 
water and juice, put on stove, let come to a boil, and 
seal in glass jars while hot.

currant juice. Put to each quart of fruit juice one 
quart of water and one pound of loaf sugar; ferment 
it in a clean, sweet cask, leaving the bung out; when

warm place to stand ten hours when it will be thick. 
Pour from one vessel to another until it becomes 
smooth and uniform in consistency. Bottle and keep 
in warm place twenty-four hours, it may take thirty- 
six in winter. The bottles must be tightly corked, 
and the corks tied down. Shake well five minutes be- 
fore opening. It makes a very agreeable drink, which 
is especially recommended for persons who do not as- 
similate their food, and for young children; may be 
drank as freely as milk. Instead of buttermilk some 
use a teaspoonful of yeast. The richer your milk, 
which should' be unskimmed, the better will be your 
Koumiss.

lon of juice add one quart ot boiling water, let it stand

strain. This may be flavored with cloves or other 
spices. 

Arrowroot. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls arrowroot with three 
tablespoonfuls cold water; add half a pint of (boiling 
water, constantly stirring, (milk may be added in stead 
of water) ; flavor with sugar, nutmeg or other spice. 
This preparation is suitable when the bowels are in- 
flamed and relaxed. 

Egg Nogg.

fresh egg with a fork in a tumbler, with some sugar, 
beat to a froth; then add a dessert spoonful of brandy

GII / I,E'rT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 263 



Egg Nogg, No. 3. 

One egg, one teaspoonful sugar, one tablespoon ful 
whisky, one-third glass milk, a little nutmeg, and a 
piece of ice the size of a walnut. Beat the yolk of 
egg, sugar and whisky together, beat the white of egg 
very stiff; mix; put in and fill glass with milk, grate 
the nutmeg on top. 

Egg Lemonade. 

This is a refreshing and nutritious drink, especi- 
ally for invalids. A tin shaker and a small wooden 
pestle are necessary. Put half of a large lemon in a 
glass, after extracting the seeds, also three lumps of 
sugar, press and work with the pestle till the juice is 
extracted and the skin soft* add two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, the same of finely cracked ice, and one raw 
egg, fill nearly full with cold water, invert the tin 
shaker over it and shake well. This is not so good 
without the ice, and should be cracked very fine. Put 
two straws in the glass and serve. 

Lemonade. 

Four medium sized lemons, three pints of water, 
sugar to taste. Cut the lemons in two after washing 
them thoroughly; place one-half at a time in a lemon 
squeezer and squeeze dry; put the juice in a pitcher 
with the sugar and pour on the water, add the ice in 
small pieces, when dissolved stir and serve. 

Acid Lemonade. 

One lemon, one teaspoonful tartaric acid, one 
teaspoonful of Gillett's lemon extract, three pints of 
water, sugar to taste. Squeeze the lemon in a lemon 
squeezer, dissolve the acid, put the lemon juice, acid, 
sugar and lemon extract in a pitcher, mix thoroughly 
and pour on the water, add ice. If a strong ade is de- 
sired use only a quart of water, Put the rind of the 
lemon in the pitcher. 



?64 GIW,ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 



Lime Ade. 

Lime ade is made the same as above; a little more 
sugar is needed than for lemons. This is very refresh 
ing and preferable to lemonade in the summer. 

Orange Ade. 

Four or five sour oranges, sugar, ice- water; make 
as you would lemonade. 

Tea. 

Colored teas are injurious, and should not be used. 
Black tea, or uncolored Japan, if of a good quality are 
free from the coloring matter often used in teas. 
Green tea is dried on copper plates and therefore is 
unwholesome. Strong decoctions of tea are bad for 
nervous people and harmful for nearly every one. 

To Make Tea. 

Scald the tea steeper, put in a small teaspoonful 
for each person, pour boiling water over it and steep 
for four or five minutes. Pour boiling water in the 
tea-pot to heat it, when the tea is steeped pour the 
water from the tea-pot, put in the tea and fill up with 
boiling water. Another way is to make the tea at the 
table; heat the china or silver tea-pot by filling with 
water, pour it out, put in the tea and boiling water; 
when it has stood a few minutes it is ready to serve. 

Coffee. 

Allow a dessert spoonful to each person and one 
for the coffee-pot; put the coffee in the bowl with the 
white of an egg and a little cold water, stir all to- 
gether thoroughly, then put it in the coffee-pot, pour 
boiling water over it and place on the stove; cover 
the spout of the coffee-pot to preserve the aroma; as 
soon as it boils up set it on the back of the stove to 
steep and settle. Coffee made in this way is delicious 
with cream and sugar. Every kind of coffee can be 



GIUvETT-S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 265 



made as above. Old Government Java and Mocha are 
good coffees and have a fine flavor, they are very of- 
ten mixed and the flavor is better than when used 
separately, two-thirds Java and one-third Mocha is 
the proportion used of each. In serving coffee pour 
it over the cream and sugar in the cups. If milk is 
used heat it and add a beaten egg, as the two com- 
bined make a good substitute for cream. 

After Dinner Coffee. 

Make as above only have it very strong and black. 
Serve in small china cups and fill them only half full, 
pass sugar and cream with the coffee. 

To Roast Coffee. 

Wash the coffee in warm water, drain through a 
colander and dry on a towel, then put it in a dripping 
pan and brown in the oven; do not allow it to burn, 
stir often that it may be evenly browned, it should be 
of a dark brown color; when done put a small piece of 
butter with it and stir the coffee. Keep coffee in a 
caddy or tightly closed dish. Grind only enough for 
each meal at a time, as the aroma escapes from ground 
coffee.

HOW 

to Remove Mildew from Linen. 

Take your clothes when dry and wet thoroughly 
with soft soap and salt mixed, chalk or starch scraped 
to a powder may be used instead of salt. Lay out to 
bleach on the grass. If once does not do, use the 
second time and the linen will be as clean and clear 
as ever. 

to make Chewing* Gum. 

Prepared balsam of tulu two ounces, refined sugar 
one ounce, oatmeal three ounces; soak the gum in 
water, then mix all the ingredients, roll in powdered 
sugar to make the sticks. 

to make Caramel. 

Boil clarified sugar until it is very brittle, pour 
on an oiled slab, soon as cool enough to receive an 
impression from the finger, stamping it in small 
squares an inch in size, then turning over the mass, 
wiping the bottom and putting in a dry place to har- 
den. Glaze with a coating of sugar and keep from 
the air. 

to make Colorings for Confectionery. 

The following coloring matters are admitted to 
be harmless. 

For Yellow. — Use Persian fustic, turmeric or saf- 
fron. 

For Blues. — Use ultramarine, indigo, Prussian 
blue. 

For Reds. — Use carmine, cochineal. 



GIU,ETT'S MAGIC COOK BOOK. 277 

For Greens. — It is best to blend any of the above 
blues and yellow together, a little practice will enable 
you to hit upon the exact tint that you want. 

For Purple. — Mix blue and red in proportions to 
yield the exact color wanted. 

For Browns. — Chocolate or burnt caramels will 
produce nearly every shade of brown as they are 
more or less weakened by water. 

to make Butter. 

Warm your cream to a temperature of 58 to 63 , 
Fahr. ; a comparatively slow motion is the best, a for- 
ward and backward movement, one revolution each 
way, keeps the cream at the bottom of the churn. 
After the butter comes, pour off the buttermilk, then 
beat awhile longer with the whips, this works it suf- 
ficient for immediate use. But for preserving it should 
be worked a little more with the paddle, adding two 
even teaspoonfuls of very fine salt to each pound of 
butter. To wash butter deprives it of part of its pre- 
serving qualities. 

To take Stains out of White Goods. 

One teaspoonful chloride of lime in about three 
quarts of water; put the part that is stained in the 
water, and let remain until the stain is out.

To Prepare Fruit for Canning. 

The following table, giving the length of time for 
boiling fruit and the right proportion of sugar to the 
quart of fruit to be used, will be of value to housewives 
in canning fruit time: 



Cherries, 

Raspberries, 

Blackberries, 

Strawberries, 

Whortleberries, 

Plums, 

Pie Plant (sliced), . 

Small Pears (whole), 

Bartlett Pears (in halves), . 

Peaches (whole), 

Peaches (in halves), 

Pineapple (sliced), 

Siberian crabapple (whole), 

Sour apple (quartered), 

Ripe currants, 

Grapes (sweet), . 

Grapes (sour), 



Place the fruit in glass cans. Make a syrup of the 
required amount of sugar, putting in as little water 
as possible for the number of cans to be filled. After 
the syrup cools a little pour into the cans, filling them 
nearly full; if there is not enough syrup add water and 
place covers on without sealing. Then put the cans 
in a kettle of cold or warm water having some nails 
or other hard substance in the bottom. Be careful 
not to let water boil into the cans. Boil the required 
time. After taking from the boiling water fill with 
hot syrup if there is any left or use hot water. Seal, 
place on the side and turn the can a moment; this 
allows the air to escape. Fill again and seal.

A Country Wedding Feast. 

A great long table fairly crammed 
With boils and bakes, with stews and steaks, 

With roasts and pies, and stomach aches 
Of ever fashion and every size, 

From doughnuts up to pumpkin pies; 
With candies, oranges and figs, 

And raisins, and all the whirligigs, 
And jimcracks that the law allows 

On such occasions, bobs and buns 
Of giggling girls with glossy curls, 

And fancy ribbons, red and blue, 

With beau-catchers and curlycues 

To beat the world.

Flavoring Extracts 



Are a luxury and appreciated only by those 
who judge them by their delicacy and strength 
of flavor. Of the thousands of cheap brands 
we care not to talk. They are without ex- 
ception either rank in flavor or weak and ex- 
pensive at any cost. 

Dealers handle them only because they 
yield a large profit. The best grades are in 
all respects the cheapest. They go farther and 
tickle the palate with the deliciousness they 
impart to the food. 

Of all the well-known brands none excel, 
few if any equal
