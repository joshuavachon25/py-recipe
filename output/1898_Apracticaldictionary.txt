How to keep a good Stock-pot for every-day 

Soups. 

PUT into a stewpan some onions, after first frying 
them brown, in a little butter. Then add any bones, 
from cold joints, chicken, or ducks ; then add some 
carrots, turnips, a bunch of herbs, a little celery, 
three lumps of sugar, some pepper, salt, and a little 
allspice. Fill up the stewpan with cold water. Let 
all simmer for twelve hours, and then drain off all 
the liquor, and put into a basin to get cold. 
Remove the fat. From nicely made stock, good 
vegetable soups can be made. A good cook always 
has plenty of stock for soups, sauces, &c. 

"A stock-pot can always be kept going, as there are 
generally plenty of bones, pieces of bacon, &c., for 
it. 

A stock-pot should be emptied every night, even 
if the same stock has to be furnished the next day. 
All rish bones and trimmings should be boiled 
down \vith \vater and spices, &c ; and this stock is 
best for making \vhite sauce, for serving with rish, 
or for moistening rish, for hsh puddings, or rish 
cakes.

4 SOUPS 

Clear Soup. 

INGREDIENTS : 

I lh. shin of beef. Bunch of sweet herbs. 

Knuckle of veal. Spices and salt. 

Plate of washed and sliced 3 lumps of sugar. 

vegetables onion*, carrots, J quart* of cold water, 

turnips, celery (or a muslin I c.u'jj; (while only). 
ba.U of celery seed). 

First fry the onions in a stewpan, with some butter, 
until quite brown, then put in all the meat and 
vegetables. Add the water, and let all come to the 
boil, very, very slowly ; then draw it to the side of 
the tire, and let all simmer slowly for six or seven 
hours. When yon think all the goodness is out of 
the meat and vegetables, have ready the white of 
the egg, beaten to a stiff froth, and squash up the 
egg-shell. Put the white of the egg, with the shell, 
in the stewpan, and whisk it hard in the soup for a 
minute or two. Then let it all come slowly to the 
boil, and when the scum has all risen to the top, lift 
the stewpan off the lire, without shaking it, and 
pour the soup, very carefully, through a line hair 
sieve, over which is a hue piece of muslin (mind 
the sieve is hot, by having hot water poured through 
it), and be careful not to pour it out fast, or shake. 
When it has all been poured off, it will be perfectly 
clear, like sherry. 

To this soup can be added chili vinegar, or sherry, 
or any flavouring you may like, and when serving it 
you can have narrow strips of tender cooked carrots 
and turnips, and a few tarragon leaves in it they 



SOUPS 5 

look very nice in the clear, bright soup or tops 
of asparagus or savoury. The bones and vegetables 
can be put down again, with less water, and this 
stock does very well for vegetable soups or purees.

ready for the soup. Strain the soup through a sieve 
into a basin, and put aside until quite cold. Then

FISH 



(WRINKLES) 

Order has three advantages it relieves our memory ; it saves 
our time ; and it preserves our property. 

The cau^c> "f failure in frying are: first, an insufficient 
quantity of fat in the pan ; second, putting things in to fry 
before the fat is hot enough ; third, too much moisture adhering 
to the surface of things to be fried. The best frying is done by 
plunging the article to be fried entirely in boiling fat, therefore 
the cook should have a good stock of frying fat, which can be 
strained and put into jars when the frying is done, and covered 
to keep out the dust, reserving each sort for its especial use- 
one for meat, one for fish, i me for vegetables, and one for sweets 
fritters, pancakes, sweet omelettes, &c. 



Whitebait. 

INGREDIENTS : 



Whitebait. 
Flour. 



Breadcrumbs. 
Lard or dripping. 



DRY the fish carefully by shaking them about in a 
clean dry cloth a few at a time is best. Then have 
ready in another cloth a handful of breadcrumbs 
and some flour. Throw in a few whitebait at a time, 
and when they are lightly covered with the flour and 
breadcrumbs, and each fish is separate, throw them 
into boiling lard or clarified dripping, and cook for 
about two minutes. Use a frying basket, as it is 
easier to get them out of the fat ; only do a few at a 
time, and mind the fat is quite boiling. Drain them 
on a sieve in front of the fire, and serve very hot 
with rolled slices of bread-and-butter, and lemon cut 
nicely. If for devilled whitebait, put cayenne pepper 
on them directly you lift them out of the boiling 
fat.

INGREDIENTS 



Pears. 
Sugar.

Custard. 



Water. 

Stew some pears nicely, first peeling and cutting 
them in half lengthways, and coreing them. Pat 
them into a stewpan, with very little water but plenty 
of sugar. Simmer until tender. Then add a few 
drops of Marshall's carmine to make a good colour. 
When done, take them out and leave them in their 
syrup to get cold. While they are cooling, make a 
nice custard, and place the pears in a cut-glass dish, 
and then pour the custard when cold on the pears 
gently, so as not to mix it with the fruit. Next whip

making the custard) with caster sugar until stiff, and 
put roughly on the top of the custard like meringue, 
and sprinkle chopped pistachio nuts over (cold sweet).

PUT 3 Ibs. of flour into a basin, with two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt and a dessertspoonful of caster 
sugar, if liked. Mix it all well together, and dissolve 
i oz. of fresh German yeast in a teacupful of 
cold water. Make a hole in the middle of the flour 
and pour this in. Then add as much hot water (the 
heat of which should be about what you could bear 
your linger in) as will make the dough a very nice 
elastic consistency. Knead for rive or six minutes. 
Then make it into loaves, and put into well-greased 
tins to rise for an hour, or until the dough has risen 
well. It is best to stand the tins on the hot-plate 
rack over the stove, and cover them over with a 
cloth. When ready, put them into a nice hot oven 
to begin with, and then gradually slacken off. When 
done, turn the loaves out of the tins, and let them lie 
bottom upwards until they are cold.

XI 
PRESERVES AND PICKLES 



Jams. 

I FIND all jams keep very good if made in the 
following way :- 

Pick the fruit when quite dry, and when picked 
over or stoned (of course that depends on the 
fruit you are preserving) put the fruit into a large 
enamel or copper preserving-pan. Allow f Ib. of 
preserving sugar to every pound of fruit. Let the 
fruit boil for half an hour, and keep stirring all the 
time, then add the sugar, and let all boil for half an 
hour more. Then put into clean dry jam pots, and 
when cold tie down. If stoned fruit is being used 
stone it Hrst, and crack the stones and put the 
kernels in with the fruit. It gives the jam a nice 
flavour. 

Sloe Gin. 

INGREDIENTS : 



i gallon of unsweetened gin. 
3 quarts of sloes. 



3 Ibs. lump sugar. 
3 ozs. bitter almonds. 



Put in a two-gallon jar the sloes, sugar, almonds, 
and the gallon of gin. Shake it every day for two 
months. Then strain off and bottle. Cork down 
securely.

Siiij.tr eandv 



Pick the Morella cherries when nearly black. See 
they are clean and dry. Prick each cherry a few 
timer-, with a silver fork, and half lill wide-mouthed 
J Ib. bottles with them and a little crushed sugar- 
c.imly, about ^ Ib. to a 2 Ib. jar. Then fill up the 
bottles with best French brandy. Cork and put a 
bladder over them. This cherry brandy is delicious 
at Christina:-, tune. It will keep good two or three 
years the longer kept the stronger and better the 
brandy. 

Orange Marmalade. 



Seville 



INGREDIENTS : 



Sugar. 



2 lemons. 

Cut the fruit into thin slices, taking out all pips. 
T > every pound of fruit add three pints of water. Let 
it ^tand twenty-four hour>. Then boil until tender. 
Allow to stand until next day, and to every pound of 
fruit allow i^ Ibs. of sugar. Then boil until the 
chips are tender, usually about thirty minutes after 
it boils. 

Blackberry Jelly. 

IXGKEDIEXTS : 

Blackberries. | Preserving sugar. 

Put all the blackberries in a large basin in a nice 



PRESERVES AND PICKLES 161 

hot oven until the juice runs from them freely. 
Then pour off the juice and press the fruit through 
a fine hair sieve until you have all the juice and pulp 
from the fruit, but not the pips. Allow i Ib. of sugar 
to each pint of fruit, and boil altogether in an enamel 
or copper preserving pan for a quarter of an hour. 
Pour into little jelly pots, and when cold it will be 
perfectly firm. Tie down with paper. 

Red-currant Jelly. 

INGREDIENTS : 
Red currants. | Loaf sugar. 

Put the currants in a jar in the oven all night. 
Next morning squeeze the juice through a cloth over 
a fine hair sieve. Measure it, and to each pint of 
juice add i Ib. of loaf sugar. Stir sugar and juice 
over the fire until it boils ; watch it carefully, and 
let it boil for three minutes (hard). When it is done 
it will jelly most beautifully. 

Chutney. 

INGREDIENTS : 



J Ib. sultanas, 
i Ib. shallots. 

\ Ib. sour apples, or goose- 
berries. 



\ pint vinegar. 
2 ozs. salt. 

J oz. of cayenne pepper 
Ib. brown suar. 



Pound the whole together in a mortar, then gently 
boil until clear. Then put into glass jars and tie 
down with corks with bladder over.

if>2 PRESERl'ES AXD PICKLES 

Red Gooseberry Jam. 

I NT, RE DIl X I- : 
Goosj.-lx.MTie-. Preserving sugar. 

Pick and top and tail the gooseberries, then weigh 
them, and to every i lb. of fruit allow lb. of 
sugar. Put the fruit into a preserving-pan (either 

pper or enamel) and stir them about until they 
boil. Let them boil for twenty minutes well, then 
add the sugar and let them boil again fast for half 
an hour. Keep stirring all the time. Take the pan 
iff the lire and put the jam into clean dry jars or 
ija^s bottK When cold it will be set firm. Then 
tie down with paper. 

How to Tie Jam Down. 

Cut sonu' rounds of tissue paper the si/e of the 
iiiMdcs of the pots, and dip them into brandy or 
whisky (one at a time). Place this paper on the 
fruit ; then cut some more tissue paper a si/e larger 
than the pots. Have ready the white of an egg, well 
beaten, on a plate, and with a paste-brush smear 
over the egg on the paper and place over the jam 
pots. Press down the edges with a cloth. When 
dry the papers will be like parchment. 

Rum Scrub. 

INGREDIENT.-* : 

3 eggs. I i tablespoonful of salad oil. 

3 lemons. Ih. of barley sugar, 

i pint of best old rum. 

Let the eggs dissolve whole in the juice of the 



PRESERVES AND PICKLES 163 

three lemons (it will take about three days), turning 
them in the juice each day. When dissolved, or 
nearly so, beat them well up and remove any bits of 
shells. To this add one pint of best old rum, one 
tablespoonful of salad oil, and J Ib. of barley-sugar 
or sugar-candy. Mix all well together and keep in a 
corked bottle. 

Dose. One tablespoonful in half or a whole 
tumbler of milk on waking in the morning. 

Pickle for Beef. 



INGREDIENTS : 



8 quarts water. 

4 Ibs. of salt. 

i oz. of saltpetre. 



2 ozs. peppercorns. 
2 ozs. allspice. 
i oz. cloves. 



2 Ibs. brown sugar. 

Boil all the spices, salt, and sugar with the water 
well for about half an hour. Put the meat in the 
pickle, which must be cold, for a week, but the meat 
must first be put into cold water for t\vo hours before 
putting it into the pickle. After the meat is pickled 
boil slowly, allowing twenty minutes for each pound. 

Recipe for Preserving Eggs for Winter Use. 

INGREDIENTS : 



Eggs. 

Cream of Tartar. 



Salt.

cold. Then stir into it i oz. of cream of tartar, and 
i Ib. of common salt. Thus eggs can be kept for 
six or eight months. 

Cream Cheese (how to make). 

Take one pint of thick sweet cream, tie it up 
in a piece of linen wetted in cold water. Let it 
hang for twelve hours then turn it out into a clean, 
wet cloth, and hang again for twelve hours. Put a 
piece of wetted butter muslin in a mould and press 
it in. Let it remain another twelve hours, then it 
is ready for market <>r u>e. 

Egg Butter for Sandwiches. 



I* 1 < r t f

liuttcr. 



Boil two or three eggs hard. When cold peel 
and put them into a pestle and mortar. Pound up, 
adding butter, pepper, salt, and a few drops of chili 
vinegar. Put into a jam pot and pour a little- 
oiled butter. This will keep good for a week and is 
very useful for afternoon tea sandwiches.

USEFUL HINTS 



ill'A7.VA7 / , 
"A pl.Kc for cYu-yihiny. and everything in its, pl.u.-.' 



Hints for Cooks. 

BE clown very early, not later than 6 a.m., so as to 
have plenty of time to get forward before breakfast. 

All drawers and cupboards should be washed out 
and clean paper put on the shelves one day in every 
week, and all brights should be cleaned once a 
w r eek. 

All dishes for late dinner should be prepared as 
nearly as possible in the morning. 

Never keep up a large lire unless absolutely 
necessary. 

Never waste any pieces ; a good cook can always 
find a use for all little scraps. 

All doorsteps, both at front and back of house, 
should be cleaned before breakfast. 

Cooks should always clear up as they go along, so 
as not to be in a muddle or late for meals " A place 
for everything, and everything in its place." 

Pastry should be made in the larder, as it is cooler 
than in the kitchen. 

A kitchen should be kept quite tidy, as most 
dishes can be prepared in the scullery, if a nice 

large table is kept there. 

167 



i68 USEFUL ///ATS 

Before going to bed leave everything washed 
up and put away in the kitchen and scullery 
quite tidy, so as you can begin straight away 
in the morning. 

Hints for Parlourmaids, 

Always make the breakfast, lunch, and dinner 
table look as nice as possible by having the plate, 
glass, and silver very bright and clean. 

The secret <>t cleaning silver or plute is to have 
it washed in boiling water, soda, and yellow soap, 
or soft soap, and to rub very dry, and polish after- 
wards with a leather. A very little plate powder is 
needed if this is done. 

All glasses should be washed in cold water, and 
polished with a cloth and dry leather afterwards. 

Mind and see th.it the tablecloth and napkins are 
kept pressed in the linen-press and folded nicely ; 
and be sure the tablecloth is always put on the 
table quite straight and clean and in the centre of 
the table ; things put on crookedly spoil everything. 

See that the plates for dinner and lunch are well 
rubbed up before they leave the kitchen. 

Always open the front door to visitors as wide as 
possible, and if not at home wait with the door 
open until the \isitors are quite clear of the house 
or garden. 

Hints for Housemaids. 

When cleaning out a room first brush all stuffed 
chairs, sofas, &c. Shake all cushions, table covers, 



USEFUL HINTS 169 

and place all on a large sofa or chair and cover with 
a dust sheet. Then dust carefully all china ornaments 
that can be moved, photograph frames, books, little 
pictures that can be taken off the walls easily, and 
place together on a sofa, and cover over with another 
dust sheet. Then when all the pieces of furniture 
that dust will spoil are covered over, begin by 
shaking the curtains and pinning up carefully well 
off the floor. Sweep ceiling and walls with a soft 
brpom, and tops of pictures and cupboards. Then 
sprinkle the carpets (of course all rugs and mats must 
be taken out into the garden and well shaken) 
with damp tea-leaves, and begin sweeping carefully 
all one way of the carpet, and take the dustpan and 
dust out of the room. Then clean your grate, 
blackleading it well while the dust is settling. Then 
remove the dust sheets carefully, so as not to let the 
dust fly about, and take them away. Next place the 
furniture where it should be in the room, and begin 
polishing it with furniture polish and elbow grease ; 
then put back pictures, ornaments, &c., and lay down 
rugs, arrange curtains (after of course cleaning win- 
dows), and do not forget to dust doors, cornices, 
wainscotting, clean all silver and brasses in room, 
and leave everything quite clean and tidy, and 
pictures straight. 

Never leave a room after sweeping and dusting 
without seeing that the windows have been rubbed, 
as dust settles on glass very quickly. 

Never go up or downstairs empty-handed ; if you 
work with your head you will save your legs. 



170 USEFl'L HIXTS 

See that there are pins and wax matches in all 
rooms, and do not leave dead flowers in rooms. 

Water-bottles in bedrooms should be emptied 
every day, and refilled with fresh drinking-water. 

To whiten a bath nib a little common whiting on 
the bath dry, and wash ot'f and polish. 

Always turn the hot or cold-water cans, when not 
in n^e, upside down, or if unable to do that leave the 
lids off always. 

Always see before setting lit^ht to a lire that the 
register is open. 

If lamps are not in daily use, be sure to wipe 
them carefully every day, as the oil oo/es through, 
and makes a m> t unpleasant smell.

PREFACE 

THIS Dictionary has been written with the view of providing a 
thoroughly practical and reliable hand-book to all classes of cookery. 

The recipes are the result of practical knowledge, and precise 
directions have in every instance been given. 

The difficulty of readily finding the particular recipe required I 
have minimised as far as possible in the present work by the addition, 
at the end of the volume, of an index of all the recipes, arranged 
under the different courses. The recipes themselves are in alphabetical 
order. 

The question of time required for cooking each particular dish is one 
to which particular attention has been given. I have indicated as 
nearly as possible the exact number of minutes required, and, in 
the case of baking, whether the time given applies to a quick or a 
slow oven. 

I have also endeavoured to give an idea of the number of people 
the quantities stated would suffice for. It will be observed that nearly 
all the recipes suitable are calculated for small families of four or five. 
Some of these would remain the same for two persons as, for instance, 
small joints, one fowl, etc. but of many, the ingredients could be 
safely halved. For larger families every housekeeper would naturally 
use her judgment and experience. In some cases the ingredie* 
would need to be doubled for eight persons, whilst in others half as m 



viii PREFACE 



again would suffice. In buying a joint of beef, mutton, or veal, one 
usually wishes to have something substantial to cut from, so more is 
allowed for each person than of dishes such as steaks, cutlets, etc. 

Such economy as is consistent with the preparation of really 
palatable dishes has been carefully studied, but I have not given the 
supposed cost, since prices vary so widely according to locality and 
season, that it is impossible for an exact estimate to be made.

COOKERY 



An Index of all the Recipes, here arranged in Alphabetical 
Order, will be found at the end of the Volume arranged 
under the different Courses. 



No. i.-ABERNETHY BISCUITS. 

Ingredients 

i Ib. flour, i oz. butter, i oz. sugar, 
\ oz. carraway seeds, i egg, 2 or 3 table- 
spoonfuls milk. 

Method 

Mix the flour and sugar together, and 
rub in the butter. Add the carraway 
seeds, and mix them well in. Beat 
and strain the egg, and add it to the 
mixture with just sufficient milk to 
make a stiff dough. Turn the paste 
on to a floured board, and roll it out 
to | inch thickness. Stamp it out 
with a round cutter 4 or 5 inches in 
diameter. Prick each biscuit with a

excellent apple, and Bramley's Seedling 
is of good flavour and serviceable for 
use at the end of the winter. For 
apple jelly, Nonsuches are considered 
the best, but any good cooking apple 
of fine flavour will make a good pre- 
serve. For dessert Ribston Pippins, 
Russet apples, and Cox's Orange Pip- 
pins are the most easily obtainable.

polished with a clean cloth before 
being placed on the table.

Ingredients 

2 to 3 Ibs. of back of bacon, water. 
Method 

Soak the bacon in warm water for 
2 hours. Then scrape the under side 
and rind as clean as possible. Put it 
in a saucepan, cover it with cold water, 
and bring it to the boil. Remove all 
scum as it rises, and let it simmer very 
gently until thoroughly cooked. Take 
it up, strip off the skin, and sprinkle 
thickly with sifted bread raspings. 
Serve immediately. 

When cold this forms an excellent 
breakfast dish. 
Time About 2 hours. 
Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. 



No. 104. BACON (Broiled Rashers of). 

Ingredients 

6 or 8 rashers of bacon. 
Method 

Cut the bacon into rather thin 
rashers, arrange them on the gridiron, 
and broil them carefully in front of, 
rather than over, a very clear fire. 

Where a gas-cooker is used this dish 
can be cooked to perfection under the 
grill or toaster, but care must be taken 
not to let the bacon burn. Turn each 
rasher constantly, and dish as soon as 
cooked on a very hot plate. 
Time 3 to 5 minutes. 
Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

No. 105. BACON (To Cure and Keep 
Free from Rust Cobbett's Recipe). 

"The two sides that remain, and 
\vhich are called flitches, are to be 
cured for bacon. They are first rubbed 
with salt on their insides, or flesh sides, 
then placed one on the other, the flesh 
sides uppermost, in a salting-trough, 
which has a gutter round its edges to 
drain away the brine, for, to have 
sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must 
not be sopping in brine, which gives 
it the sort of vile taste that barrel and 
sea pork have. Every one knows how 
different is the taste of fresh, dry salt 
from that of salt in a dissolved state. 
Therefore change the salt often once 
in four or five days let it melt and 
sink in, but not lie too long ; twice 
change the flitches, put that at the 
bottom which was first on top. This 
mode will cost you a great deal more 
in salt than the sopping mode, but 
without it your bacon will not be so 
sweet and fine nor keep so well. As 
for the time required in making your 
flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on 
circumstances. It takes a longer time 
for a thick than a thin flitch, and 
longer in dry than in damp weather, 
or in a dry than in a damp place ; but 
for the flitches of a hog of five score 
(a score is a weight of 20 Ibs.), in 
weather not very dry or damp, about 
six weeks may do ; and as yours is to 
be fat, which receives little injury from 
over-salting, give time enough, for you 
are to have bacon until Christmas 
comes again. The place for salting 
should, like a dairy, always be cool, 
but well ventilated ; confined air, 
though cool, will taint meat sooner 
than the mid-day sun accompanied by 
a breeze. With regard to smoking the 
bacon, two precautions are necessary. 
First, to hang the flitches where no 
rain comes down upon them ; and 
next, that the smoke must proceed 
from wood, not peat, turf, or coal. 
As to the time required to smoke a 
flitch, it depends a good deal upon 



whether there be a constant fire 
beneath, and whether the fire be 
large or small. A month will do if 
the fire be pretty constant and rich, 
as a farmhouse fire usually is ; but 
over -smoking, or rather too long 
hanging in the air, makes the bacon 
rust ; great attention should therefore 
be paid to this matter. The flitch 
ought not to be dried up to the 
hardness of a board, and yet it ought 
to be perfectly dry. Before you hang 
it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the 
flesh side pretty thickly over with bran, 
or with some fine sawdust (not of deal 
or fir) ; rub it on the flesh, or pat it 
well down upon it. This keeps the 
smoke from getting into the little open- 
ings, and makes a sort of crust to be 
dried on. To keep the bacon sweet 
and good, and free from hoppers, sift 
fine some clean and dry wood ashes. 
Put some at the bottom of a box or 
chest long enough to hold a flitch of 
bacon. Lay in one flitch, then put in 
more ashes, then another flitch, and 
cover this with 6 or 8 inches of 
the ashes. The place where the box 
or chest is kept ought to be dry, 
and, should the ashes become damp, 
they should be put in the fire-place to 
dry, and when cold put back again. 
With these precautions the bacon will 
be as good at the end of the year as on 
the first day."

No. 108. BAKING (Remarks on). 

Baking is a method of cooking which 
requires a certain amount of skill and 
much care. It is most important to 
have the oven at the right heat. To 
ascertain whether the oven is hot 
enough to bake satisfactorily, one or 
two simple tests may be employed. 

The most usual is to try with the 
hand. The oven should be so hot that 
the hand cannot be comfortably borne 
in it for more than half a minute. 
Should the oven only feel warm to the 
hand, it is not hot enough, whereas, if 
the oven is so hot as to be almost 
unbearable to the hand, it will be too 
hot for use, and the door must be left 
open for a few minutes before anything 
is put into it. 

Another way is to put a small piece 
of bread on the top shelf, if the bread 
becomes crisp and slightly coloured in 
two or three minutes, the oven may 
with safety be used. 

One of the most frequent causes of 
failure in baking is neglecting to keep 
the fire well made up. The decreasing 
heat fails to penetrate the meat or 
cakes, and joints browned outside but 
uneatably underdone within, or cakes 



a half-cooked mass of dough in the 
centre, are the result. 

Bread requires a hot oven with a 
well-kept-up bottom heat or the bread 
will not rise evenly, therefore ordinary 
kitchen ovens are not well adapted to 
the baking of bread, as the oven being 
much hotter on the side nearest the 
fire, the bread will rise more on that 
side, and the loaves require careful 
watching and turning to overcome that 
disadvantage. It is easier to bake 
small loaves than large, so that it is 
always desirable for an inexperienced 
bread maker to form her dough into 
loaves of i Ib. or i^ Ibs. weight. 

Cakes should be put into a moderately 
quick oven, unless they are very large, 
when a thoroughly hot oven is absol- 
utely necessary. All cakes must be 
very thoroughly cooked, and should be 
pierced with a small skewer before they 
are finally removed from the oven. If 
any of the cake mixture adheres to the 
skewer, the cakes must be put back 
for a few minutes and tried again. 
When the skewer comes out perfectly 
clean and bright, it is a sure sign that 
the cakes are cooked through. A 
buttered paper should be laid on the 
cakes as soon as they are browned on 
the top to preserve them from acquiring 
too much colour. 

Pies and tarts should be of a clear 
golden colour when done, and must 
also be covered with a buttered paper 
as soon as the crust begins to take 
colour. As soon as the crust is 
sufficiently done, the pie should be put 
on the lower shelf of the oven to finish 
cooking. Meat, poultry, and game 
require a good soaking heat, and 
should be constantly basted or they 
will be dry and hard.

BEEF, BRISKET OF BEEF (COLLARED) 



Leave it thus for 2 hours. Mean- 
while, strain the liquor the meat was 
boiled in, and reduce it to glaze by

over the meat, giving it two or three 
coats until an even, shining surface is 
obtained. Allow the glaze to dry, and

No. 191. BOILING (Remarks on). 

Meat intended to be served should 
be put on in very hot water, the better 
to keep in its juices, brought quickly 
to boiling point, and simmered gently 
until done. An apple sliced and 
added to the water the meat is cooked 
in is a simple and effective way of 
rendering the meat tender. Fresh 
meat and bones intended for soup 
should be covered with cold water, and 
heated as slowly as possible by the 
side of the stove to draw as much of 
the goodness as is possible from the 
meat. They should be very gently 
stewed for some hours until every 
particle of nourishment has been ex- 
tracted. 

Most kinds of fish are put on in 
cold water, well salted. Fish must 
always be very gently simmered, or the 
skin will break and the fish present a 
very unsightly appearance at table. 
Whilst fish must never be served in 
the least degree raw, it is equally im- 
portant not to over-cook it, or the 
flavour will be much impaired. It is 
well to test the fish very lightly with 
the blade of a knife, by inserting it in 
the thickest part of the fish near the 
backbone. If the fish is inclined to 
come away easily from the bone it is 
done, and should be well drained and 
served without delay. 

Vegetables must always be cooked 
in plenty of fast-boiling water, which 
should be well salted, and, for green 
vegetables, a tiny piece of soda, the 
size of a pea, may be added to 



BOUILLON BRADENBURG PUDDING 



each gallon of water; this helps to 
preserve their colour, but very little 
must be used or the vegetables will 
taste soapy. To obtain dressed vege- 
tables in the greatest perfection, the 
main things to be observed are : to 
dress them as fresh as possible ; not to 
put them in the saucepan until the 
water is really boiling fast ; to cook 
them in plenty of water and as rapidly 
as possible (without a cover to the 
saucepan) ; and to serve them very hot 
the moment they are done. 

Puddings should be put on in plenty 
of boiling water to cover them, and a 
little fresh boiling water added from 
the kettle as that in the saucepan boils 
away. They must not be allowed to 
cease boiling for an instant. Delicate

should be steamed in about ij inches 
of water, a little more being added 
from time to time as the water

No. I92.-BOUILLON. 

Ingredients 

3 Ibs. leg of beef, 2 quarts water, 
2 carrots, 2 turnips, i onion, 2 leeks, 
|- head of celery, \ tea-spoonful savoury 
herbs, i tea-spoonful salt, 12 pepper- 
corns. 

Method 

Cut the meat into several pieces, 
lay them in a flat stewpan, and pour 
the water on them. Let this heat 
slowly by the side of the fire, skim it 
when it begins to boil, and simmer it 
gently for 30 minutes, skimming it 
carefully from time to time. Well 
wash the vegetables, slice them, and 
add them, with the herbs and seasoning, 
to the meat. Stew the broth gently for 
another 3^ hours. Strain it into a 
large bowl, and set it aside to cool. 
When required for use, skim off every 
particle of fat, and heat as much as is 
required to boiling point. 

This is a nourishing and inexpensive 



soup, and if carefully prepared, does 
not require any further clearing by 
means of white of egg or meat. It 
may be varied in many ways by the 
addition of Italian paste, semolina, 
Julienne vegetables, etc. They should 
be gently simmered in the broth, when 
it is heated up for table, until they are 
tender. It is not advisable to use the 
bouillon as a soup the day on which 
it has been made, as it is very difficult 
to render it entirely free from fat. 
Time Altogether, about 4 hours. 
Sufficient for 2 quarts of soup. 



No. 193. BOVRIL (To Use for Gravies). 

Ingredients 

i large tea-spoonful bovril, \ of a 
small onion, J pint water, tea-spoon- 
ful arrowroot, seasoning pepper and 
salt. 

Method 

Put the bovril in a small saucepan, 
pour on it the boiling water, and stir 
well. Slice the onion, and simmer it 
in the bovril for 15 or 20 minutes. 
Then take out the onion, mix the 
arrowroot with a table-spoonful of 
cold water, stir this into the gravy, and 
add a seasoning of pepper and salt. 
Simmer for 2 or 3 minutes until suf- 
ficiently thickened ; strain and serve. 

This will be found a convenient 
method of making gravy for poultry 
or game, should there happen to be 
no stock in the larder. If bovril is 
used for cooking, it should be bought 
in the larger bottles of 8 or 1 6 oz. 
The small bottles are proportionately 
dearer, and if used constantly, would 
be rather an expensive luxury. 



No. 194. BRADENBURG PUDDING. 

Ingredients 

i?, Ib. black currants, 6 oz. moist 
sugar, \ pint water, 7 or 8 slices 
bread and butter, \ pint cream. 



BRADENBURG PUDDING BRAWN 



Method 

Strip the currants from their stalks 
and wash them. Put them in a sauce- 
pan with the sugar and water, bring to 
the boil, and stew them gently until 
thoroughly cooked. Well butter a 
pudding-basin, and line it with moder- 
ately thin bread and butter, cutting 
off all the crusts, and fitting in the 
pieces so as to form a neat case. 
Take the currants off the fire, and put 
them into the basin spoonful by spoon- 
ful, pressing them very gently against 
the sides. There should be plenty of 
rich, thick syrup for the currants to be 
very moist. When the basin is quite 
full, fit in a cover of bread and butter, 
and press it slightly. Put a saucer or 
plate over the basin, with a weight on 
top, and set it aside for at least 6 
hours. Turn it out carefully on to a 
glass dish. Whip the cream, and 
cover the pudding with it. 

This pudding can be made with 
advantage the day before it is required. 
It should be left in the basin as long 
as possible, and not turned out until 
required to be served. 

Any juicy fruit may be used for this 
recipe. It is excellent made with 
raspberries and red currants, or with 
damsons. The fruit must, in every 
case, be well-cooked, with sufficient 
juice just to soak through the bread 
and butter case without breaking it. 
Time To cook currants, about i hour. 
Siifficient for 5 or 6 persons.

(Made with Blackberries). 

Ingredients 

i Ib. blackberries, \ Ib. apples, 6 oz. 
sugar, | pint water, 7 or 8 slices bread 
and butter, \ pint cream. 

Method 

Wash and pick the blackberries, 
peel, core, and slice the apples, and 
put these together in a saucepan with 



the sugar and water. Bring to the 
boil, and then simmer gently until the 
blackberries are quite tender. 

Well butter a pudding-basin, and 
line it with moderately thin bread and 
butter, from which cut off all the crust. 
Fit in the pieces exactly, so as to form 
a neat case. Take the hot black- 
berries off the fire, and with a spoon 
put them carefully into the basin, 
pressing the fruit very gently against 
the sides. There should be plenty 
of rich, thick syrup for the fruit to be 
very moist. 

When the basin is quite full, fit in 
the bread and butter cover, and press 
it gently, put a saucer or plate over the 
basin with a weight on top. Stand 
it aside for 6 hours. Turn it out 
carefully into a glass dish. Have the 
cream ready whipped, and cover the 
pudding with it. 
Time To cook blackberries, i to

mix well. Then turn the brawn into 
oval cake moulds and put aside to cool. 
Put a plate on the top of each mould, 
with a heavy weight on top. The 
brawn will keep for several days. It is 
necessary to put the pig's head on a 
very hot dish, and chop the meat 
before the fire, or the fat will 
settle in the meat and spoil the brawn. 
When required for table, dip the 
mould into boiling water for half a 
minute. Turn the brawn into a 
clean dish, and garnish with very 
fresh parsley. 

Time To cook, 4 hours. 
Sufficient for 8 or i o people. 



No. 197. BRAWN (Another Recipe). 

Ingredients 

i pig's head, i tea-spoonful mixed 
herbs, 6 crushed peppercorns, \ tea- 
spoonful salt, 3 carrots, 2 onions, \ head

Method 

Procure a lightly salted pig's head, 
and have it cut in half and boned at 
the butcher's. Spread it out flat. Cut 
some of the flesh from the lean parts, 
and lay it on the fatter portions. Cut 
the tongue into thin strips and lay 
them in the head. Mix together the 
herbs, crushed peppercorns, and salt, 
and sprinkle half the mixture over the 
pig's head. Roll the head up as 
tightly as possible. Lay the roll in a 
stout and very clean cloth, and tie it 
round very firmly with tape or string. 

Choose a stewpan a little larger 
than the brawn. Cut the vegetables 
into small pieces, and cover the 
bottom of the pan with part of them. 
Lay the roll of brawn on this, and put 
the rest of the vegetables, the season- 
ing, and parsley round and on the roll. 
Pour in sufficient cold water to cover 
the brawn. Bring the meat to boiling 
point, and boil gently for 4 hours. 



Then turn the contents of the stewpan 
just as they are into a deep pan, and 
set it aside for i hour. At the end of 
that time lift out the brawn. Lay it 
in a dish. Put a plate on it, with a 
heavy weight on top, and leave it to 
become quite cold. Then take it out 
of the cloth, put it on a fresh dish, 
and it is ready for table.

No. 237. CAKES (Remarks on). 

All cakes should be thoroughly 
cooked in a tin lined with buttered 
paper, and should have a buttered 
paper laid over them as soon as they 
are nicely browned on top. 

It will be observed that I have 
generally given directions that the 
butter is to be melted with as slight a 
degree of heat as will suffice to liquify 
it, and beaten in, a tea-spoonful at a 
time, the last thing before the cake is 
put into the oven. This will be found 
much less trouble than beating the 
butter to a cream and mixing the other 
ingredients with it. In a few instances, 
such as pound cake, I have adhered 
to the old-fashioned way as being .suited 
to that particular composition. In 
these cases the butter should be put 
into a small, hot basin, and beaten with 



CAKE (BIRTHDAY) CAKE, POUND 



a wooden spoon until it becomes 
smooth and creamy. 

Eggs must always be beaten and 
strained before they are added to the 
cake, and any other liquid, such as 
milk or brandy, should be added to the 
eggs before they are mixed with the 
dry ingredients, so that the whole cake 
is moistened at once. 

Currants should be washed and 
picked, then spread out on a large 
dish (which should be put on the 
kitchen fender), and very slowly dried. 
They must be quite dry before they are 
used or the cakes will be heavy. 

Sugar should be pounded, but brown 
sugar may be used in plain cakes. 

Great care must be taken in the 
baking of cakes. Further directions for 
the heat of oven, etc., may be found 
under " Remarks on Baking." 

Only really fresh eggs and fruit of 
fine quality should be used.

Dip a cloth into boiling water, wring

crushed shells of the eggs with the water 
for a minute, and add them with the 
rinds and juice of the lemons, the sugar, 
brandy, and sherry, to the stock. Put

the diner's place before the guests 
enter the dining-room, as is usual 
with oysters. Canapes generally con- 
sist of anchovies, caviare, lax, etc., 
laid on a small square of thin white or 
brown bread and butter, and garnished 
with stoned olives, hard-boiled yolk of 
egg, and a tiny portion of very fresh 
salading. Simplicity of flavour and 
delicate neatness of appearance are 
the main points to be considered.

can be made if judgment and a little 
forethought are used.

than i of an inch in thickness. 
Some little practice may be necessary 
to get the little squares exactly the 
right size, but as much of the appear- 
ance of the canape depends upon the 
bread and butter being of sufficient 
substance to hold its dressing neatly 
without being thick and clumsy, some 
attention should be given to this point.

No. 295. CHARLOTTE la 
PARISIENNE. 

Ingredients 

i savoy cake, | Ib. apricot, straw- 
berry, or other jam, the whites of 
2 eggs, Ib. icing sugar. 

Method 

Cut the cake into slices, spread each 
slice thickly with jam, and put the 
cake together again in its original 
shape. Whisk the whites of the eggs 
to as stiff a froth as possible, mix in 
the sugar quickly, and cover the cake

No. 296. CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Ingredients 

12 sponge finger biscuits, f pint 
cream, \ oz. isinglass, \ pint boiling 
milk, \ tea-spoonful vanilla flavouring, 
the white of i egg. 



Method 

Split the biscuits carefully in halves by 
inserting the point of a knife between 
the joins. Trim each piece into a strip 
about an inch wide. When all are 
ready place them in a row, and cut the 
edges even at the top and bottom. 
Have a Charlotte russe tin ready, and 
put the white of the egg in a plate. 
Take a strip of biscuit and stand it 
against the side of the mould ; take a 
second strip, dip one side very lightly 
into the egg, and press it gently against 
the one in the mould ; moisten the edge 
of a third piece and press it to the 
second. Continue in this manner until 
the sides of the tin are completely 
lined. Should the mould be wider at 
the top than at the bottom some of 
the biscuits must be shaped to cor- 
respond, as it is imperative that the 
case be quite firm throughout. Put 
the isinglass in a cup, pour the boiling 
milk on it, and stir it occasionally 
until dissolved. Have the cream in a 
large basin, and whip it to a thick froth, 
thoroughly stir the melted isinglass, 
which by this time will have cooled 
considerably, but should still be quite 
liquid, and add it with the vanilla 
flavouring gradually to the cream. 
Beat for 3 or 4 minutes until the 
cream is again very thick, then pour it 
into the mould, and set it aside to 
stiffen. In 2 hours it will be quite 
firm. 

At first it may be found rather 
difficult to fit the strips of biscuit 
neatly into the mould, but a little 
experience will soon overcome this 
difficulty. 
Sufficient for i^-pint mould.

exclude the air, or the cheese will go 
mouldy. If this is done the cheese 
will keep for a week or 10 days.

101 



No. 393. CROUTONS (Fried). 

Ingredients 

3 slices bread, 2 oz. butter. 

Method 

Cut the bread a third of an inch thick 
from a rather stale loaf, and stamp it 
out into rounds with a plain cutter 
about \\ inches in diameter. Melt the 
butter in a small frying-pan, put in the 
croutons, and fry them until they 
are quite crisp, and of a pale golden 
colour. Drain them carefully on 
kitchen paper, and they are ready for 
use. 

When croutons are used as a founda- 
tion for small savouries, much of the 
excellence of the savoury depends on 
their careful preparation. They must 
be free from grease, crisp but not 
tough, and very hot. 



No. 394. CRUMPETS (To Toast). 

Ingredients 

6 or 7 crumpets, i oz. butter. 

Method 

Have a very clear fire and a hot 
muffin-dish and cover ready. Toast 
the crumpet carefully until nicely 
browned on one side, then turn it and 
toast on the other. Be very careful 
not to hold it so near as to let it burn 
or get blackened against the bars. 

Butter each crumpet, as it is done, 
on the top side, sprinkle it with a very 
little salt, cut it in half, and place it in 
the hot dish. Do all as quickly as 
possible, but remember that they must 
be thoroughly cooked. Serve immedi- 
ately they are ready, and let them be 
eaten very hot. 

For crumpets, muffins, hot toast, etc., 
only very fresh butter should be used, 
as heat always accentuates any fault in 
this respect. 

Time For 6 crumpets, about 15 
minutes. 

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

in the centre, and strain the water into 
it, using a wooden spoon to mix it 
into a smooth paste. Turn it on to a

it on to a floured board, and roll it out. 
Cut the butter into thin slices, lay it 
on half the paste, fold over it the other 
half, and roll it out into a sheet \ of 
an inch thick. Fold this in three, roll 
it out again, and the crust is ready for 
use.

CRUST, DRIPPING CRUST, HALF PUFF 



quired, as it much depends on its 
thickness.) Turn it on to a floured 
board, knead it slightly, roll it out to 
^-inch thickness, and it is ready for 
use. 

This makes a very delicate crust for 
fruit tarts, etc., and may be used in 
place of puff or short crust. 



No. 398. CRUST, DRIPPING. 

Ingredients 

i Ib. flour, 4 oz. clarified beef drip- 
ping, \ tea-spoonful baking-powder, 
\ tea-spoonful salt, about 3 table-spoon- 
fuls milk, \ pint water. 

Method 

Mix the salt and baking-powder with 
the flour and rub in the dripping, then 
add the milk and water gradually, and 
with a wooden spoon make the mixture 
into a smooth paste ; turn it on to a 
well-floured board, roll it out, sprinkle it 
with flour, roll it out again to required 
thickness, and it is ready for use. 



No. 399 CRUST, LARD. 

Ingredients 

i Ib. flour, 4 oz. lard, i oz. butter, 
3 table-spoonfuls milk, \ pint water. 

Method 

Rub the lard and butler into the 
flour, and make them into a smooth 
paste with the milk and water, using a 
wooden spoon to mix the dough with, 
turn it on to a floured pastry-board, roll 
it out once or twice, and the crust is 
ready for use. 

No. 400. CRUST, PUFF. 

Ingredients 

i Ib. flour, i Ib. butter, yolks of 2 eggs, 
juice of i lemon, \ tea-spoonful salt, 
7 or 8 table-spoonfuls water. 

Method 

Put the flour in a basin and make a 
hollow in the centre, in which place 



the yolks of the eggs (first removing the 
speck), salt, lemon juice, and sufficient 
very cold water to make a smooth 
paste, mixing the dough with a wooden 
spoon as the water is added. Turn the 
crust on to a floured pastry-board, and 
leave for 5 minutes, then roll it out 
into a sheet \ an inch in thickness, and 
sift a little flour on it. Press the butter 
into a sheet about an inch thick, and 
lay it in the centre of the paste, fold 
over each end on to it, entirely hiding 
the butter, sift a little flour over, and 
roll the paste out into a long sheet \ of 
an inch thick. If this is properly done 
the paste and butter will flatten out 
without the butter breaking through 
the paste. Sift a little flour on the 
board and on the paste between each 
rolling-out. Fold the paste in three, 
and roll out ; fold again in three, roll out 
a second time, then put the paste on a 
floured dish, and leave it in a very cool 
place, or, in summer, over ice for \ an 
hour. At the end of thai time fold 
and roll out twice again, set it aside for 
\ of an hour, then fold and roll out 
twice making 6 rollings-out in all 
and it is ready for use. It is most 
important to have the butter thoroughly 
cold and hard, as if it is at all soft and 
greasy it is impossible to prevent it 
breaking through the paste, which will 
then not rise properly. Should it 
seem at all watery, wring it dry in a 
cloth, or the paste will be heavy, but 
if good fresh butter is used this ought 
not to be necessary.

No. 415. CURRIES (Remarks on). 

Curries are commonly known as dry 
curries and wet curries. In a dry 
curry, the meat, after being cooked in 
the curried sauce, is stirred over a gentle 
fire until all the sauce has evaporated, 
great care being taken that the meat 
does not get burnt in the process. In 
a wet curry, the meat is served in a 
small quantity of very thick sauce, and 
this is the more ordinary way. 

Curries to be made in perfection 
should be of fresh meat, but the 
ordinary housekeeper seldom wishes to 
disguise her uncooked meat in this 
form. If care be taken in the prepara- 
tion of the sauce, and all the skin, fat, 
and gristle be removed from meat, or 
skin and bones from fish, and they be 
cut into small dice and slowly heated 
in a well-made sauce, a really palatable 
curry may be easily obtained from re- 



io6 



CURRY SAUCE CUSTARD (BOILED) 



mains of cold meat and fish. Recipes 
for various curries will be found 
throughout the book. The amount of 
curry powder must be increased if a 
very hot curry is wished, and the 
difference in the heat of curry powders 
must also be considered. Personally, 
I always use Vencatachellum's curry 
powder; I find it keeps well, and is of 
excellent flavour. 

The border of rice to a curry should 
be very carefully prepared, so that the 
grains are separate and dry. If the 
precise directions given in recipe No. 
1025 are followed, this will be attained 
without difficulty.

CUTLETS (TO CUT) DAMSON JELLY 



No. 424.-CUTLETS (To Cut and 
Trim). 

Choose a nice piece of the best end of 
neck of mutton or lamb, and have the 
meat cut to include as many bones as 
you require chops for the dish. Direct 
the butcher to saw off the chine and 
chop through the bones, but do not 
allow him to divide the cutlets. Have 
a very sharp knife, and cut the neck 
into small, neat chops, taking care they 
are all the same size. Lay each cutlet 
on its side, take off most of the fat, 
leaving a thin border round the meat, 
and trim the cutlets into a nice shape. 
Make a small cut each side through 
the fat and skin attached to the top 
of the cutlet, and scrape the bone 
quite clean for i^ or 2 inches down, 
this is to enable a frill to be slipped 
round the top of the bone, and it gives 
the cutlet a smarter appearance.

No. 449.- DISH ING UP (Remarks on). 

Food is so entirely dependent for its 
perfection on the way it is dished, and 
sent to table, that too much attention 
cannot be given to this point. 

A good cook spares no trouble, even 
with the most ordinary materials to 
make each dish look dainty and ap- 
petising, but this must be done with 
expedition in serving hot dishes, or 

H 



food excellently prepared will be en- 
tirely spoilt. To dish up really well, 
a cook must be devoid of hurry and 
confusion ; she should think out all 
the small details of her requirements, 
and have them ready to hand before 
she begins. She should not have to 
leave a dish of cutlets to look for the 
frills, or to let the fish cool whilst pre- 
paring lemon and parsley. It is well 
to have all the plates and dishes chosen 
and polished, and sundries ready quite 
an hour before dinner is to be served, 
but care should be taken not to dish 
up too socn. No dish is improved by 
waiting, and a young and anxious cook 
is apt to forget this in her desire to 
avoid unpunctuality. If everything is 
made ready in good time, the actual 
dishing will only take a few moments, 
and should be postponed until the 
dishes will be immediately carried to 
table. 

The size of the dishes should be 
chosen with a view to neatness. Let 
those for joints be of sufficient size to 
allow 3 inches clear margin all the way 
round to the inside rim ; on the other 
hand Irish stew, haricots, etc., should 
be dished compactly with the gravy 
poured evenly over. A stew or curry 
spread over a large dish looks at once 
slovenly and ill-cooked, whereas the 
same material carefully arranged can 
have quite a dainty appearance. 

All entrees, and vegetables served 
as entremets, should be served in 
entree dishes, and these are a great 
help in producing a dainty effect. 

With all hot dishes, hot plates must 
be sent to table, and the dishes also 
should be made thoroughly hot, those 
of china being heated on the plate 
warmer ; silver dishes should be half- 
filled with boiling water, then emptied 
and polished quite dry with a clean 
soft cloth. Every possible care should 
be taken to let all hot dishes be really 
hot and the cold dishes perfectly cold. 
Creams and jellies, should be set on

DRESDEN PATTIES DRIPPING (TO USE) 



ice whenever practicable, and all food 
should be set aside to cool in as cold 
a place as possible. 

No. 4SO.-DRESDEN PATTIES. 

Ingredients 

2 French rolls, 2 table-spoonfuls 
milk, 2 oz. butter. 

Method 

Cut each roll crosswise in three 
pieces of equal thickness, and with a 
plain round cutter stamp them into 
rounds about 2 inches in diameter; 
then hollow out the centre of these, 
leaving about \ inch of bread all round 
and at the bottom. Put the rounds in 
a flat dish, and pour the milk on them, 
a tea-spoonful at a time. (They must 
not be made too wet or the cases will 
break.) When they have soaked up 
all the milk, drain them, melt the 
butter in a small frying-pan, and fry 
them for 3 or 4 minutes on each 
side until they are a light golden 
colour, then take them out, drain care- 
fully, and fill them with any good 
preparation of minced chicken and 
tongue, or oysters, etc., and serve. 
These are a nice substitute for puff- 
paste patties. 

Time To fry patty cases, 6 or 8 

minutes. 
Sufficient for 6 patties. 



No. 451. DRIPPING (To Clarify). 

Method 

Cut the dripping into small pieces 
and put it in a basin ; pour on it 
sufficient boiling water to cover it, and 
stir well until all the dripping is dis- 
solved. Strain it into a fresh basin, 
and set it aside to become cold. Re- 
move the dripping from the water and 
lightly scrape any sediment off the 
bottom ; absorb any water on a clean 
cloth, and the dripping is ready for 
use. 



No. 452. D RIPPING (To Clarify, 
another Method). 

Method 

Put the dripping in a saucepan with 
sufficient hot water to cover it and 
bring gently to the boil. Simmer it 
for 2 or 3 minutes, then strain it into 
a clean basin and set it aside. When 
cold and firm remove the dripping 
from the water, and scrape any sediment 
off the bottom. If drops of water cling 
to the dripping, absorb them on a clean 
cloth. 



No. 453. DRIPPING (To use). 

All dripping should be clarified be- 
fore it is used, whether for frying or 
basting, or in the making of cakes or 
pastry. 

For pastry and cakes use only beef 
dripping, and this is always to be 
preferred for frying and for basting 
poultry and game. Mutton dripping 
can of course be used for basting all 
joints of mutton, and it is well to re- 
member not to use the beef dripping 
for this purpose. Always pour the 
dripping from the pan into a fresh 
basin, and set it apart until clarified. 
For frying, it is best to save the drip- 
ping until you have between 2 and 
3 Ibs, then clarify it altogether, and set 
it apart in a large basin to be used for 
frying only. If care is taken it can be 
used several times. Never mix beef 
and mutton, or used and unused drip- 
ping, and always baste if possible with 
the same kind as the meat. 

If the fat from fried bacon is poured 
off every morning into a basin, in a week 
there will be sufficient to baste a fowl 
or pheasant. Meat can of course be 
basted over and over again with the 
same dripping clarified each time, but 
for basting game dripping can only be 
used once, and should then be thrown 
away.

No. 478. EGGS (To Choose). 

Hold the egg to the light, or in front 
of a lighted gas or candle, and if the 



egg looks clear it is good, if thick it is 
stale, and if a black spot is visible it is 
worthless. Cooks should be exceed- 
ingly careful as to the quality of the 
eggs they employ, as an even slightly 
tainted egg will entirely spoil an other- 
wise perfect dish. Eggs served by 
themselves should if possible be new 
laid, and very fresh eggs should be 
chosen for delicate sweets. 

No 479. EGGS (To use Economically). 

However fresh the eggs may be, 
always break each one separately into a 
small basin or cup before adding it to 
others, or to any mixture. If it looks at 
all doubtful throw it away and wash the 
cup before breaking another egg into 
it. 

To break an egg, hit it smartly in the 
middle against the edge of a basin or 
cup ; if you wish to separate the yolks 
and whites, catch the yolk in half the 
shell and pour it into the other half 
over a basin until only the yolk is left. 
You must do this quickly and carefully 
or the whites will be specked with 
yolk. 

Many sweets require only the whites 
of eggs, and it is well to remember in 
connection with this that custard is 
always richer made with yolks only ; 4 
yolks can be used instead of 3 whole eggs, 
and in this way two sweets can be made 
to fit into each other. For instance, 
meringues can be made with the whites 
left from a rich custard, and a vanilla or 
any other cream would use the yolks 
left from a lemon sponge. The cold 
eggs left from breakfast can be put into 
boiling water, boiled for 10 minutes, 
and used for salads or garnishing a 
hicken in bechamel or a similar dish. 

No. 480. EGG and BREADCRUMB, to. 

In all cases where egg and bread- 
crumbs are directed to be used, the 
appearance of the^dish much depends 
on the neatness of the cook.

EGG BALLS EGGS (EN CAISSES) 



The egg should be well beaten and 
strained into a small basin. This will 
be found much more convenient than 
a flat plate. Anything too large to be 
dipped into the basin should be brushed 
over with egg. Have a very clean pastry- 
brush and set it aside for this pur- 
pose. Each time after using wash it 
thoroughly in very hot water and let it 
dry before putting it away. Paint the 
cutlet, or whatever it may be, rather 
lavishly with egg, and sprinkle the 
breadcrumbs all over it so that the 
egg is entirely covered. Breadcrumbs 
should be made of rather stale bread ; 
they should be sifted and spread out 
on a plate to dry before they are put 
away or they will mould. It is very 
much more economical to have some 
breadcrumbs always in readiness, as a 
great deal more of new bread must be 
used, and then it is often unsatisfactory. 
Pieces of bread and crusts cut off toast 
should be dried in the oven, then 
crushed with the rolling-pin, or in the 
mortar, and carefully sifted. Keep the 
breadcrumbs in a tin, and only turn 
out the quantity you think you will 
require to use. If you have any left 
over sift them before mixing them with 
those in the tin. 

Keep breadcrumbs made from the 
crumb of bread in a separate tin from 
those made of dried crusts, etc.

No. 519. FISH (Remarks on). 

The choosing, preparation, and cook- 
ing of fish require great care and nicety. 

The first thing necessary is that the 
fish itself should \>t perfectly fresh and 
of good quality ; secondly, it must be 
thoroughly cleansed ; and thirdly, it 
must be cooked skilfully, so that it is 
thoroughly, but not over, done. Fish 
to be boiled should be put into cold 
water and brought gradually to the 
boil, then allowed to simmer gently 
until tender, when it should be taken 
up immediately, and served as soon as 
possible. To keep it hot, if required 
to wait, leave the fish on the fish-plate 
across the kettle and cover it with a 
clean cloth. Dish boiled fish on a hot 
napkin, and garnish it with very fresh 
parsley and cut lemon. Lobster coral 
may be advantageously used sprinkled 
over the surface of a fine turbot, and 
cray-fish, fillets of soles, prawns, etc., 
are used to garnish large fish when more 
effect is desired. 

Fish to be fried should be dried in 
a clean cloth, then floured and covered 
with egg and breadcrumbs, or dipped 
in batter as preferred. Next to oil, lard 
or refined suet will be found the best 
for frying fish, but clarified dripping can 



FISH (AU GRATIN) FISH SALAD 



be used with satisfactory results. When 
cooked, the fish must be thoroughly 
drained on kitchen paper, and garnished 
with fried parsley. It is as well to serve 
fried fish on fish-papers as it is apt to 
stain a damask serviette. 

Fish to be broiled must be opened, 
seasoned, and placed on a gridiron 
which has been previously warmed and 
rubbed with suet. A clear fire is im- 
peratively necessary, and great care 
must be taken not to let the fish be 
smoked or burnt.

Use). 

Foie gras should be served in the 
terrine in which it is bought. This 
should be placed on a very clean 
d'oyley, and garnished with a little 
very fresh parsley. Some small pieces 
of crisp toast should be placed on the 
table. 

The remains of a terrine of foie gras 
may be used to great advantage in cook- 
ing. Small pieces may be put among 
the pieces of meat or game in a good pie, 
or a small quantity may be added to the 
ingredients of a plain forcemeat, and 
will, in either case, be found to much 
improve the flavour of the whole. An 
excellent savoury can also be made, for 
which a recipe will be found below.

Ingredients 

2 or 3 slices of buttered toast, 
\ small terrine foie gras, a very little 
pepper.

Cut the toast into small, neat fingers, 
about i inch wide and 2 long; it 
should be very fresh and crisp. Cut 



the foie gras about \ inch thick, and 
lay it on the toast, so as to cover it, 
but not to come quite to the edge. 
Sprinkle a very little cayenne or ground 
pepper over, and make the toast very 
hot in the oven. Serve very hot, gar-

lightly, and mix the grated cheese with 
them; break the butter into small pieces 
and add it to the yolks. Beat the 
whites to as stiff a froth as possible, stir 
them into the mixture, season with 
pepper and salt, and bake in a well- 
buttered, round cake-tin. Serve im- 
mediately it is taken out of the oven, 
and pin a very white napkin neatly 
round the tin. 

Time 15 to 20 minutes.

No. 532. FORCEMEATS (Remarks 
on). 

Great care must be taken in the 
preparation of the ingredients for force- 
meats, and these should be so perfectly 
mixed that no flavour unduly predomi- 
nates. Breadcrumbs should be fresh and 
carefully sifted, and suet, parsley, etc., 
must be minced as finely as possible. 

The suet, butter, and veal force- 
meats are those most usually employed 
on ordinary occasions, but forcemeats 
are capable of great variation, and 
dishes may be much improved by 
using a suitable and dainty forcemeat. 
Fillet of veal stuffed with oysters,

FORCEMEAT BALLS FORCEMEAT, CHESTNUT 



partridges with mushrooms, and capons 
with truffles, are dishes well worth 
the trouble involved in their prepara- 
tion. With fish the improvement is, 
perhaps, even more noticeable. Oyster 
forcemeat is particularly suitable for 
stuffed cod, but it will also be found 
excellent with any baked and stuffed 
fish, or mushrooms may be substituted 
with very good effect. For plain 
forcemeat for fish I prefer one made 
with butter to that made with suet ; 
a little anchovy may be added when 
liked. The taste and judgment of the 
cook will guide her in the selection 
of a suitable forcemeat for different 
dishes, and a little forethought will 
often suggest a pleasing addition to the 
plain ingredients.

142 FRUIT JELLY (WINTER) FRYING (REMARKS ON) 



each of which very gently press a 
strawberry, pour in a little jelly, just 
sufficient to form a setting for the fruit, 
and let it set. When it is firm add 
more jelly to the depth of an inch. 
Let that set. Then lay in a cherry or 
two, a strawberry, and 3 or 4 pieces of 
peach and apricot. Pour in a little 
more jelly, but very carefully, or the 
fruit will float to the top ; let this set, 
and continue in this manner until all 
the fruit is used, and the mould full. 
The filling of the mould must be 
effected extremely gradually, or the 
fruit will not be evenly distributed 
throughout the jelly. Care must also 
be taken that the fruit is not placed 
too closely together, or the jelly will 
appear dull and heavy when turned 
out. In warm weather it is almost 
imperative to keep the mould on ice, 
or the jelly will not be firm. 
Sufficient for i -quart mould. 



No. 565. FRUIT JELLY (Winter).

put a layer of strawberries at the 
bottom of a deep glass dish or bowl, 
sift sugar on them, then put a layer 
of raspberries and red currants, and 
build the rest of the strawberries into 
a cone shape, with the white currants 
arranged on, and round them. Sprinkle 
sugar over each layer of fruit, and let 
it stand. Just before serving, pour the 
wine over the fruit. The salad should 
be mixed at table. 

Fruit salads can be varied indefinitely, 
but care should always be taken that 
only very fresh and fine fruit is used, 
and the wine should be light, and of 
good quality. If pine apple is used, 
the skin should be removed, and each 
slice cut into quarters.

Ingredients 

\ Ib. fruit, 3 oz. sugar, puff crust, 
No. 400, made with 8 oz. flour, and 
other ingredients in proportion. 

Method 

Stew the fruit with the sugar until 
nearly all the juice is absorbed, and 
set it aside to cool. Roll out the paste 
thin, stamp it out into rounds with a 
4-inch cutter, lay some of the stewed 
fruit on the half of each, turn the 
other half over, and press the edges 
together, wetting them with a little 
water, or white of egg, to make them 
stick. Make the half circle neat with 
the cutter, and bake in a moderately 
quick oven. 

Time 15 to 20 minutes. 
Sufficient for 8 turnovers. 



No. 568. FRYING (Remarks on). 

There is hardly a more uncommon 
or valuable quality in a cook than that 
of being able to fry really well. Success 



GAME (HASHED) 



in this mode of cooking is so entirely 
a matter of care and trouble, that it is 
astonishing that pains-taking people 
should still fail to serve up their fried 
dishes so as to do them any credit. 
If a few simple rules are faithfully 
adhered to, the whole difficulty will be 
easily overcome. 

The first point to be considered is 
the frying fat, as this is the most im- 
portant factor. It is absolutely useless 
to attempt to fry in 2 or 3 spoonfuls 
of lukewarm grease. At least 2 Ibs. 
of fat should be used, and this must 
be boiling before the frying-basket is 
plunged in. On all occasions where 
it is at all practicable, use the frying- 
basket. It has a great many advan- 
tages, and for small delicate entires, 
chipped potatoes, filleted fish or smelts, 
it is almost indispensable. The fat 
should be melted in a saucepan (into 
which the basket will just fit), and 
brought slowly to boiling-point; a 
crumb of bread thrown in will brown 
instantly when the fat is ready for use, 
and the basket should then be im- 
mediately plunged in. If the right 
quantity of fat is used, the contents of 
the basket will be covered, and there 
will be no necessity to turn them when 
half done, an operation usually fraught 
with danger to the appearance of the 
entree. Be very careful that the fat 
does not burn ; once the fat is really 
boiling, a slight degree of heat is 
sufficient to keep it so. The same fat 
may be used by a careful cook over and 
over again, but it should be clarified 
each time. 

Basins of fat should be kept care- 
fully separate. Fat used for frying fish 
must be kept for that purpose alone. 
There should also be a basin of fat 
reserved for cutlets, rissoles, etc. As 
I have mentioned before, clarified 
dripping can perfectly be used, but, 
if fat is purchased for the purpose, 
refined suet is an excellent preparation 
for frying. 

For fritters and delicate entremets, 



a basin of very pure lard should be 
kept, and carefully strained each time 
it is used. If the fat should, unfortu- 
nately, be burnt, the whole must be 
thrown away, and the same quantity 
of fresh substituted, but this accident 
should be an unusual occurrence. 

In dishing up, it should be remem- 
bered that frying is boiling in fat, and 
that draining is quite as necessary 
after frying as after ordinary boiling. 
Never turn anything fried straight out 
of the basket or pan on to a dish ; 
have ready some kitchen paper, and 
absorb all the grease possible. In 
taking up the frying-basket, let it drain 
over the saucepan for a minute, and 
then turn the contents on to paper. 
It is well to place the paper on a dish, 
and let this rest on the kitchen fender, 
as all fried dishes should be served 
extremely hot. 



No. 569. GAME (Hashed). 

Ingredients 

Remains of cold game, f pint stock, 
\ small onion, | oz. butter, i tea-spoon- 
ful arrowroot, i table-spoonful claret or 
port, seasoning salt and cayenne. 

Method 

Remove all skin and fat from the 
game, and cut it into dice. Cut up 
the onion and fry it with the butter 
in a very clean saucepan for 5 or 6 
minutes, then pour off any butter re- 
maining, add the bones and skin of 
the game, and cover them with the cold 
stock. Bring all to the boil, and 
simmer for an hour. Strain the broth 
(which now will be reduced to about 
half a pint) into a fresh saucepan. Mix 
the arrowroot smoothly with the wine, 
and stir this into the broth. Continue 
stirring over the fire until nicely thick- 
ened, then put in the game, and let 
it heat slowly by the side of the fire.

GAME PIE GAME (RAISED PIE OF) 



Add a seasoning of salt and a little 

cayenne, and serve very hot. 

Time To make sauce, about i hour 

and 10 minutes. 
To heat meat, 15 to 20 minutes. 



No. 570. GAME PIE. 

Ingredients 

Back and hind-quarters of a hare, 
i brace partridges, forcemeat No. 537 
or No. 538, puff crust No. 400, made 
with i Ib. flour, and other ingredients 
in proportion, \ pint stock or gravy 
jelly, 2 hard-boiled eggs, seasoning 
pepper and salt, yolk of an egg. 

Method 

Cut the hare into small joints, and 
each partridge into quarters. Line a 
pie dish with a thin layer of the force- 
meat, then lay in the pieces of hare 
and partridge, sprinkle them with 
pepper and salt, and build the pie up 
in a dome shape, filling the interstices 
with more forcemeat. Cut the eggs 
into slices, and lay them round the 
edge of the pie ; pour in the gravy jelly 
or stock, which must be warmed just 
enough to become liquid. Moisten 
the edges of the pie-dish, lay a thin 
border of crust round, roll out the 
cover, place it on top, and ornament 
the edges neatly; brush the pie over 
with a paste-brush dipped in beaten 
egg-yolk, and bake the pie in a good 
oven for about a hours. The pie 
may be ornamented with leaves of 
pastry in a wreath or other design 
when liked. These must be slightly 
wetted on the under side, and 
lightly pressed on the cover to cause 
them to adhere. A buttered paper 
should be laid over the top of the pie 
to protect the crust, and the pie must 
be carefully watched, so that the outside 
does not take too deep a colour whilst 
the contents are cooking. 
Time 2\ hours. 
Sufficient for i large pie. 



No. 571. GAME (Raised Pie of). 

Ingredients 

2 brace of partridges, grouse, or 
other birds, forcemeat No. 538, raised 
crust No. 395, made with i Ib. flour, 
and other ingredients in proportion, 
^ pint gravy jelly No. 613, 2 hard- 
boiled eggs, seasoning pepper and salt, 
yolk of an egg. 

Method 

Butter a raised pie-mould and line 
it with crust, reserving sufficient 
for the cover. Spread a very thin 
layer of forcemeat at the bottom of 
the pie, and place on it some of the 
pieces of game, which must be cut into 
small neat joints, sprinkle them with 
pepper and salt, and build the pie up 
in a dome shape, filling the interstices 
with more forcemeat until all the pieces 
are used. Cut the eggs into slices, 
lay them round the edge of the pie, 
and pour in the gravy jelly, which 
must be warmed just enough to become 
liquid. Roll out the cover, place it 
on top, fasten the edges together 
securely, and ornament them neatly. 
Make a wreath of small pastry leaves, 
and decorate the top of the pie with 
these, slightly moistening their under- 
side, that they may adhere properly. 
Brush the pie with a pastry-brush 
dipped in beaten egg-yolk, and bake in 
a good oven for 3 hours. A buttered 
paper should be laid over the top of 
the pie to protect the crust as soon as 
the pie is nicely coloured. The pie 
should be left in its mould until cold, 
when the mould must be carefully un- 
done and lifted away, and the pie 
garnished with very fresh parsley before 
it is sent to table. If liked, the lid 
of the pie may be removed, and re- 
placed by a thick layer of very fresh 
and delicately made aspic, lightly 
chopped. 

Time 3 hours. 
Sufficient for i large pie. 



GAME (RISSOLES OF) GARNISHING (REMARKS ON) I45 



No. 572. GAME (Rissoles of). 

Ingredients 

Remains of cold game, \ pint stock, 
-| small onion, \ oz. butter, the yolks 
of 2 eggs, seasoning salt and cayenne, 
i egg, breadcrumbs, frying fat. 

Method 

Carefully remove all skin and fat 
from the game, and chop it finely. 
Cut up the onion, and fry it with 
the butter for 5 or 6 minutes. 
Strain off any fat, add the bones and 
skin of the game, and cover with the 
cold stock. Stew this for i hour. 
Then strain the broth into a fresh 
saucepan, and boil it rapidly until re- 
duced to f of a pint. Take it off the 
fire and let it cool for 5 or 6 minutes. 
Beat and strain the yolks of 2 eggs and 
add them to it. Mix well, add the game 
and seasoning, and stir all over the fire 
until the sauce is very thick, but do not 
allow it to boil, or it will curdle instantly. 
Set it aside to cool in a basin, and when 
cold, make it into small rolls about z\ 
inches long and i inch deep. Dip these 
into beaten egg, cover them with fine 
breadcrumbs, and arrange them in a 
fry ing- basket. Have ready a saucepan 
of boiling lard or refined suet, plunge 
the basket into this, and fry the rissoles 
a light golden-brown. Turn them on 
to kitchen paper to drain, and serve 
on a hot napkin, garnished with fried 
parsley. 

Time To make gravy, about \\ hours. 
To cook mixture, 10 to 15 minutes. 
To fry rissoles, 6 or 7 minutes. 
Sufficient for 8 or 10 rissoles. 



No. 573. -GAME SOUP. 

Ingredients 

Remains of a brace of birds, i oz. 
fresh breadcrumbs, \ small onion, \ oz. 
butter, 3 pints stock, i tea-spoonful 
arrowroot, i wine-glassful claret or port, 
seasoning salt and cayenne. 



Method 

Take all the flesh off the birds, and 
set it aside. Melt the butter in a stew- 
pan, and fry the onion in it for 7 or 
8 minutes ; pour off all fat, add the 
bones and trimmings of the game, 
cover them with the cold stock, and 
stew gently for 3 hours; then strain, 
and set aside to cool. When cold, 
skim off every particle of fat, and heat 
the stock in a fresh saucepan. Mince 
the meat and pound it and the 
breadcrumbs together in a mortar, 
moistening them with one or two 
spoonfuls of game stock, then stir this 
into the hot stock ; add the wine and 
arrowroot smoothly mixed, and stir all 
until the soup is nicely thickened, when 
season with a little salt and cayenne, 
and serve. 

Time To make stock, about 3 hours. 
To heat and thicken soup, 10 to 15 

minutes. 
Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. 

No. 574. GARNISHING (Remarks on). 

Garnishing, in general, must be 
simple in design and colouring, and 
care should be taken that it is not 
overdone. Parsley and cress are most 
used, and these should be perfectly 
fresh and well washed. Boiled fish 
should be garnished with fresh, and 
fried fish with fried parsley. Lemons 
cut into thin slices or small devices 
are suitable with both. Lobster-coral 
alternated with fresh parsley is an 
effective garnish to turbot, and the coral 
may also be used to form a design on 
the fish. 

Roast chickens and fowls should 
be garnished with watercress. Boiled 
fowls covered in sauce look well with 
hard-boiled yolk of egg rubbed through 
a fine sieve on to the breast of the 
bird. Game need not be decorated. 
Joints of boiled or braised beef and 
mutton should have small heaps of the 
vegetables cooked with them, carefully 
arranged round the dish. 



146 



GENOISES GIN SAUCE 



The decoration of hot dishes must, 
of course, be quickly done, that the 
meat may not cool during the process. 

In garnishing cold dishes a little 
moie latitude may be allowed, and time 
is then not so much an object. Beef 
should be garnished with little heaps 
of scraped horse-radish and sprigs of 
fresh parsley. Aspic, in croutons, or 
chopped, may be employed to garnish 
all cold meats with good effect. In 
garnishing sweets, such as trifles, a great 
deal may be done by the dainty com- 
bination of colour to be obtained from 
angelica, glace cherries, and apricots, etc. 
Natural taste is necessary, but a little 
care and trouble will be well repaid. 
More precise directions for garnishing 
various dishes will be found included 
in the recipes for them.

Method 

Put the sugar and water into a small 
saucepan, and boil them together for 
5 minutes. Mix the arrowroot smoothly 
with the lemon juice. Add this with 
the gin to the sugar and water. Bring 
again to the boil, simmer for 2 or 3 
minutes until slightly thickened ; strain 
into a very hot sauce-boat, and serve. 

Time Altogether, about 10 minutes. 
Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. 



No. S79.-GINGER-BEER. 

Ingredients 

i oz. ground ginger, i oz. German 
yeast, thick slice toast, rind of i and 
juice of 3 lemons, 2 Ibs. loaf sugar, \ oz. 
cream of tartar, 2 gallons boiling water. 

Method 

Cut the lemon peel very thin, and 
put it with the strained juice into a 
large earthenware bowl. Add the 
ground ginger, cream of tartar, and 
loaf sugar. Spread the yeast on a thick 
slice of toast, add it to the other in- 
gredients, and pour over all 2 gallons 
of boiling water. Mix all well together, 
taking care not to break the toast, and 
set the bowl aside for 24 hours. At 
the end of that time take out the toast 
and skim off any particles of yeast 
there may be floating on the surface. 
Then fill the bottles (which should be 
of stone, as wine bottles would break), 
taking great care not to disturb the thick 
sediment at the bottom of the bowl, 
which must not be used. Then cork 
the bottles carefully with new corks, 
which must be previously soaked in 
boiling water for 10 minutes to cause 
them to shrink, drive the corks firmly 
in, and tie them down with stout twine.

Mo. 589. GLAZING (Directions for). 

Method 

Melt the glaze in a small glaze-pot, 
or in a jam-pot, set in a saucepan of 
boiling water, and with a pastry-brush 
brush the meat over with the hot 
liquid. A second coat ma}', with ad- 
vantage, be given. The appearance of 
all cold joints is immensely improved 
by glazing, and hot joints well repay 
the trouble by their excellent appear- 
ance. In the latter case, the glazing 
must be done very expeditiously, or 
the joint would cool, and lose in taste 
what it gained in appearance. 

Glaze can so easily be prepared by 
boiling down good brown stock or 
gravy, that no household need be 
without it. 

Meat brushed over with glaze will 
keep good and fresh for some days.

No. 607. GRAVIES (Remarks on). 

Directions for making gravy from 
the tin for roast meat are given 
below, and this is the most satis- 
factory method to employ for beef, 
mutton, etc. Poultry and game must 
have a little gravy made separately, 
either prepared from the trimmings of 
the birds, or from a little fresh meat, 
unless there is some light stock in the 
larder when that may be used instead. 
Gravy for game should, if possible, be 
made from the trimmings and bones of 
a bird prepared for a previous meal. 
In households where game is frequently 
eaten, there is generally a carcass and 
trimmings of some game bird, which, 
stewed down with a few vegetables, 
would produce a small quantity of 
well-flavoured gravy for the fresh bird.

No. 614. GRAVY (For Roast Joints). 

Sufficient gravy for the joint can 
generally be obtained by straining off 
all the dripping in the tin in which 
the meat was cooked, adding, accord- 
ing to the size of the joint, from to 
^ pint of really boiling water with a 
pinch of salt, and stirring them well 
together. The gravy thus obtained 
should be strained round, but not 
over the joint, and the meat sent to 
table instantly. Great care must be 
taken to pour off all . the dripping, or 
the gravy will be greasy, and the cool- 
ing fat will cake round the spoon and 
the inside of the dish before the joint 
is removed from table. This always 
gives a slovenly and unappetising ap- 
pearance to the meat, and is entirely 
unnecessary if care be taken.

sprigs of parsley. Anchovies and sar- 
dines should be carefully drained and 
arranged cross-wise in a lattice work, 
with little heaps of capers decorating 
the end of the dish. Lax, caviare, 
olives, etc., can be tastefully arranged 
in separate compartments or dishes, 
garnished with parsley or fresh cress.

No. 677. JELLIES (Remarks on). 

Great care must be taken with 
jellies that they are of such a consist- 
ency as to be firm enough to retain 
their shape without possessing any 
gluey taste or solidity of substance. 
Where fresh fruits are used in making 
the jelly, care must be taken that the 
delicate flavour of the fruit is not im- 
paired by too long boiling, i oz. isin- 
glass of good quality to a quart mould 
should make a perfect jelly, light and 
delicate, but quite firm enough to retain 
its shape. In summer the jelly should 
be set on ice, if this is not obtainable 
an additional \ oz. of isinglass must be 
used. Jelly made from stock care- 



fully prepared from calf's feet is always 
to be preferred when obtainable, but 
very good results are possible from 
isinglass with very much less time and 
trouble. Jellies should be made at 
least six hours before they are required.

No. 747. LOBSTERS (To Choose). 

Lobsters, if bought alive, should feel 
heavy for their size, and be full of 
motion. If freshly cooked they should 
be very stiff, and the tails much curved 
inwards. Cooked lobsters should also 
feel heavy. The hen lobster is much 
prized on account of the coral, which 
is very valuable for garnishing and for 
use in sauces.

be destroyed instantly. To put on 
lobsters merely in hot water is a bar- 
barous, unnecessary, and inexcusable 
cruelty, as their flavour is by no means 
improved by this method of cooking.

No. 788. -MEN US (To Arrange). 

The sequence of the courses re- 
mains the same, however many or few 
there may be, I therefore give the 
order in which they are served for a 
complete dinner. 

HORS D'CEUVRES. 

SOUP. 

FISH. 

ENTREES. 

ROAST. 

ENTREMETS. 

GAME. 

SWEETS. 

SAVOURY. 

ICE PUDDING. 

DESSERT. 

Some of these courses can, with ad- 
vantage, be omitted in giving a small 
dinner. The excellence of each indivi- 
dual dish should be considered of much 
greater importance than the number and 
variety of things put on the table. 

In summer, game can be well re- 
placed by roast chicken or capon, 
served with a very fresh salad and a well- 
cooked entremet of asparagus ; broad 
or French beans is always acceptable. 

As a general rule, 4 or 5 well-cooked 
and carefully-chosen dishes, form the 
most agreeable dinner. It should be 
remembered that game invariably 
comes immediately before the sweets, 
however long or short the dinner. 
At a formal dinner vegetables are 



MERINGUES MILK PUNCH 



handed separately only with the joint. 
In selecting dishes, two roast courses 
should not be given, therefore with 
game braised or stewed meat is usually 
served. If two entrees are given they 
should be of different colours, i white 
and i brown.

No. 814. MUTTON (To Choose). 

It will be noticed that all the recipes 
given are calculated for small mutton, 
i.e. Southdown or Scotch, a leg of 
which averages in weight about 7 
Ibs. This is always to be preferred 
when the number in family does not 
necessitate very large joints. For ex- 
cellence of flavour no mutton can 
excel the Welsh, and these little joints 
are most convenient for families of 2 
or 3 persons. Legs can be bought as 
small as 4^- Ibs., and all the joints are 
worth the extra price paid when a 
small delicate joint is required. Large 
mutton should be carefully cooked, so 
that it is done throughout without 
being burnt outside. 



No. 815. MUTTON, BREAST OF 
(and Caper Sauce). 

Ingredients 

2 or 3 Ibs. breast of mutton, f pint

mutton into a stewpan with sufficient 
water to cover it. Bring gently to the 
boil, and let it simmer gently until 
done. Make the caper sauce as 
directed, letting it become rather 
thick. Take out the mutton, drain it, 
and place on a very hot dish. Cover 
it completely with the sauce, and serve. 
Time To simmer mutton, i hour. 
Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

(Rolled). 

Ingredients 

3 or 4 Ibs. breast of mutton, force-

the meat carefully. Spread the force- 
meat on the meat, roil it up and tie it 
securely with tapes. Roast it in front 
of a good fire, or in a rather hot 
oven, and keep it well basted. When 
cooked take it up, untie the tapes, 
and serve the joint on a very hot 
dish, with a little clear gravy poured 
round.

and put it in the stewpan with the salt, 
peppercorns, and cold water. Bring 
gradually to the boil, and simmer 
gently until reduced to i quart. Strain 
the broth into a clean basin, and set it 
aside until quite cold. When required 
for use take off every particle of fat, 
and heat up as much as will be taken 
at one time. 

If the patient is allowed vegetables, 
the addition of a carrot, small onion, 
and sprig of parsley will much im- 
prove the flavour of the broth.

No. 824. -MUTTON CUTLETS (Re- 
marks on). 

Endless recipes could be given for 
the various forms of serving this dish, 
but as the difference is not in the 
cooking of the cutlets, but in the 
choice of the vegetable or sauce which 
accompanies them, I have avoided 
unnecessary repetition, and given merely 
a few suggestions. The vegetable or 
pure'e should be arranged in the form 
of a pyramid for the cutlets to rest 
against. Sauce should be poured 
round the cutlets, which should be 
neatly arranged, standing in the centre 
of the dish. 

Cutlets plainly fried No. 821, or Mar- 
inaded No. 822, can be served with

This is a very advantageous way of 
buying mutton when the housekeeper 
has a cool larder. If the forequarter 
is carefully divided, it can be made to 
provide 4 hot dishes at small expense. 
A forequarter of small mutton weighs 
from about 1 1 Ibs. to 15 Ibs. Cut off the 
shoulder and hang it up, as this will 
keep the longest. You have then left 
the best end of the neck, the breast, and 
the scrag end of the neck. The breast 
can be boiled with caper sauce, or 
stuffed and rolled. The neck can be 
roasted, used for cutlets, or boiled. 
The scrag end can be made with care 
into an excellent haricot or Irish stew, 
and the shoulder roasted, or cooked in 
any way preferred.

No. 855. OMELETS (Remarks on). 

In making omelets, be careful not to 
let the mixture be too much spread. 
A small round frying-pan is the most 
suitable for cooking them in. Great 
care must also be taken not to let the 
omelet burn ; it should be cooked over 
a gentle fire, and stirred unceasingly 
until it sets. Where a gas cooker is 
used, the toaster will be found to 
answer admirably for cooking ome- 
lets. Place the omelet on the top 
of the toaster, stir it for 3 or 4 
minutes, then take out the spoon, and 
hold the frying-pan underneath the red- 
hot grid for i or two minutes. This is 
the most perfect way of cooking 
omelets. Too much expedition in 
serving cannot exist; the omelet should 
not be put in the pan until the maid is 
ready to carry it straight to the dining- 
room as soon as it is finished.

No. 903. PASTRY (Remarks on). 

Care, a light cool hand, and a well- 
managed oven, render the making of 
good and wholesome pastry a simple 



matter. All the materials must be per- 
fectly good of their kind, whether 
butter, dripping, or lard is used. Short 
crust made with a moderate proportion 
of butter is preferable for ordinary 
fruit tarts, as being much more whole- 
some than richer crusts. 

In making puff crusts, two things 
should be noted, the condition of the 
butter must be very cold andyfrv/;, and 
a good steady heat must be main- 
tained in the oven the whole time of 
cooking. In summer, puff paste must 
be kept over ice in the intervals be- 
tween rolling. For all pastes, use a 
wooden spoon to mix with, and pro- 
ceed with as much expedition as 
possible. 



No. 904. PASTE (Feuilletage.) 
Ingredients 

i Ib. finest Vienna flour, i Ib. fresh 
butter, \ tea-spoonful salt, yolks of 2 
eggs, about 7 or 8 table-spoonfuls of 
very cold water. 

Metlwd 

Put the flour in a bowl with the salt, 
rub in i oz. of the butter, make a hole 
in the centre of the flour, put in the 
yolks of the eggs, first carefully remov- 
ing the specks, and add just sufficient 
very cold water to make a firm, smooth 
paste, using a wooden spoon to mix 
with. Turn the paste on to a floured 
board, and leave it to cool for ten 
minutes, then roll it out about f-inch 
thick. Wring the butter in a very clean 
cloth to extract any moisture, and be 
sure that it is firm and cool, or the paste 
will not rise properly. In summer the 
butter should be placed on ice for half 
an hour before it is used. Put the 
butter in the centre of the paste, which 
fold over as if making a dumpling, 
dredge a little flour on, and roll the 
paste out -inch thick, taking care 
that the butter does not break through. 
Fold the paste in three, and roll it out 
again, then put it on a floured dish, and 



226

knife remove the soft inside paste, leaving 
rather less than \ inch thickness all the 
way round, and \ inch at the bottom. 
When wanted for use, make the patty 
cases very hot in the oven, have ready 
the preparation also heated, fill the

No. 989. PRESERVING (Remarks on). 

Fruit used for preserving must be 
picked on a dry day and very fresh. 
If the jam cannot be made the day the 
fruit is brought in, it should at least be 
stalked and put in a pan with the sugar 
in layers. It will then keep 24 hours 
with much less harm than if left un- 
touched. 

Jams must always be made in copper 
preserving-pans, and stirred with a 
wooden or silver spoon. Tin must 



24 6 PRUNES (COMPOTE OF)-PUNCH (REMARKS ON) 



not be used, or it will spoil the colour 
of any red jam. It is impossible to 
give the exact time for boiling, the 
jam must be tried, and not considered 
done until a little poured on a plate 
sets. The jam, when potted and tied 
down, must be kept in a cool, dry 
place. The different kinds should be 
used more or less in rotation, so that 
if any jam shows signs of turning, it 
would be discovered quickly, and 
should then be re-boiled and consumed 
as soon as convenient. If this pre- 
caution were more generally taken, 
large quantities of jam would not be 
discovered unfit for use.

minutes before serving dredge the

nicely frothed. Place them on a very 
hot dish, remove the skewer and trus- 
sing strings, and garnish them with fried 
breadcrumbs. Send brown gravy and

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. 



No. 992. PUNCH (Remarks on). 

All punches are obtained by the 
mixing of various spirits and liqueurs, 
with a sherbet of water, sugar, and 
lemon juice, flavoured with lemon peel. 

It is essential to a punch that the 
mixture should be cooked, but no 
punch should ever be allowed to boil. 
For this reason it is always advisable to 
make punch in a bain-marie saucepan, 
so as to avoid the possibility of this 
happening. But though it is essential 
that the mixture should be cooked, it 
is important that the spirits and liqueurs 
should be left to simmer for as short a 
period as is necessary, for them to blend 
thoroughly with the sherbet and to be- 
come sufficiently hot. A general 
principle to be observed in punch- 
making should therefore be, to cook 
all the ingredients which go to make 
up the sherbet first, and only to add 
the spirits and liqueurs when these are 
thoroughly blended. Lemon peel is a 
flavouring used in almost all punches, 
but it should be used judiciously. It 
is better not to put shavings of the peel 
into the mixture, as is often done, 
because, if left in even for a short 
time, the flavour is apt to be too pro- 
nounced, and even bitter. The best 
plan is to rub one or two of the pieces 
of sugar to be used in the punch on 
the peel of one of the lemons. Quite 
enough flavour is obtained in this way, 
and there is no fear of the punch 
acquiring the bitter taste of over- 
soaked peel. Spices, if used at all, 
should be used very sparingly.

ROASTING (REMARKS ON) RUM PUNCH 



259 



Method 

Mince the meat as finely as possible, 
mix it with the gravy, and season with 
pepper and salt. 

If you have a small piece of puff or 
short crust left over from making a pie 
or tart use it, otherwise make a very 
small quantity of paste, as directed 
above. Roll it out as thinly as possible, 
and cut it into 2-inch squares, which 
turn so as to form a diamond shape ; 
place a small tea-spoonful of mince on 
one half, fold over the other, and press 
lightly round ; then fold the edge 
daintily round, forming the rissoles 
into crescents ; brush them over with 
the egg, beaten and strained ; crush the 
vermicelli with the rolling pin, sprinkle 
a little over each, arrange them in a 
frying-basket, plunge them into boiling 
fat, and fry a delicate golden brown. 
Turn them on to kitchen paper to 
drain, and serve on a hot napkin, 
garnished with fried parsley. 

There is often sufficient for this dish 
left on the bones of a chicken or 
pheasant before it is stewed down for 
gravy. The legs of a partridge or 
similar bird can also be advantageously 
used in this way. 
Time To fry, 5 or 6 minutes. 
Sufficient for 8 or 9 rissoles. 



No. 1042. ROASTING (Remarks on). 

The old-fashioned and excellent 
method of roasting before an open fire 
is now, unfortunately, almost obsolete. 
To obtain as good results with oven 
cookery as was formerly easily obtain- 
able with an open range is by no 
means easy. The tendency of the hot, 
dry air of the oven is to dry and 
harden the outer portion of the joint, 
thus making it difficult for the heat to 
penetrate the inner parts. This can 
only be obviated by constant and 
thorough basting, and every cook should 
pay great attention to this point. 
Poultry and game should be covered 



with a sheet of buttered paper to 
protect the breast, and this should be 
removed about 10 minutes before the 
bird is served, to allow of the breast 
taking a nice colour. Good clarified 
dripping answers perfectly for the 
basting of all birds, butter is really an 
unnecessary extravagance. Dripping 
used for basting game will not be fit 
for use a second time, as it will have 
acquired too strong a " gamey " flavour 
to be pleasant. All birds are much 
improved by having a slice of fat bacon 
tied on the breast, this, of course, must 
be removed before they are sent to 
table. 



No. I043.-RUM PUNCH. 

\ bottle rum, \ pint brandy, i 
liqueur-glass curagoa, i pint water, 
\ pint lemon juice, 6 lumps sugar,

and sugar into a bain-marie saucepan ; 
add a scrape of nutmeg, and let the 
mixture or sherbet simmer for a 
\ of an hour ; add the curagoa to the 
rum, mix in the brandy, and then stir 
them, not too fast, into the saucepan. 
Let the whole mixture simmer for 
a minute or two up to a temperature 
a little beyond drinking-point, and 
serve in small tumblers. 

If the rum is very old and soft the

No. 1063. SAUCES (Remarks on). 

The badness of the sauces served at 
ordinary tables has become so pro- 
verbial as to be a disgrace to house- 
keepers. 

This is quite unnecessary, and 
every cook should endeavour to over- 
come the difficulty which is apparently 
felt by most in making the proper 
accompaniments to their dishes. 



Sauces should never be made at 
the last minute, this occasions hurry ; 
and a sauce, however simple, requires 
time and care. All wine sauces, 
gravies, and bread sauce can be pre- 
pared hours before they are required, 
and heated up in a bain-marie when 
wanted for table. If the necessary 
bain-maries are not at hand, pour the 
sauces into gaily pots, and stand these 
in a stewpan of boiling water. 

One of the most necessary sauces 
to learn is the ordinary melted butter. 
This is the foundation of so many 
sauces, and is so constantly required 
that every cook should study one of 
the simple recipes given, and learn to 
make it perfectly. 

White sauces should be of a nice 
creamy white, smooth and thick, and 
those intended to mask the meat with 
which they are served, such as caper 
sauce with mutton, and bechamel with 
fowl, should be sufficiently thick to really 
do so. Nothing looks more miserable 
than a chicken with a poor-looking 
sauce imperfectly covering its limbs. 

Brown sauces should not be so thick 
as white sauces, but should lightly 
adhere to the spoon. Care must be 
taken to make them an appetising 
colour, by the addition of a few drops 
of browning, if necessary. Arrowroot is 
very much better than flour for 
thickening brown and wine sauces; it 
gives a clear transparency, instead of 
the raw dulness of flour. It should be 
used in very small quantities, and the 
flavour is then quite imperceptible, 
even to the most delicate palates. For 
most white sauces I prefer flour, and 
in my recipes will be found mentioned 
the thickening I have found most suit- 
able. 

The exact quantity of sauce to 
make is largely a matter of experience, 
and, of course, varies according to the 
individual tastes of families. Cooks 
are generally inclined to make a 
good deal more than is required, but 
it is as great a fault to have too little, 



SAUCE (ALLEMANDE) SAUCE (FOR BRAWN) 



265 



ind a more irreparable one. One table- 
spoonful of sauce is usually enough to 
illow for each person, and i table 
spoonful over; of bread sauce more 
is often liked. Bread sauce should be 
Df a fair consistency, neither sloppy 
nor firm. In conclusion, I would 
suggest that when sauce is left at the 
table it should not too hastily be thrown 
iway, as it can very often be advan- 
:ageously used in making rissoles, 
scallops, etc. 

Sauce-boats should be most care- 
iilly heated, or the sauce will be 
:ooled before it reaches the table. 
Fhis is especially disagreeable in the 
:ase of white sauces, when a skin is 
ikely to form on the top. Fill the 
sauce-boats with boiling water, and 
eave them for at least 10 minutes, 
)nly emptying them out immediately 
Before the sauce is out in.

No. 1080. -SAVOURIES (Remarks on). 

Savouries should be simple, and they 
should be savoury, not sweet, and cer- 
tainly not both mixed together, as when 
anchovies are served with cream. 

The idea of a savoury is to leave a 
clean taste in the mouth, and the 
materials should be chosen with that 
object in view. Anchovies, in various 
forms, provide a large choice, and soft 
roes on toast, cheese souffle's, or toasts 
and olives prepared in different ways 
will usually be found acceptable. The 
perfection of the savoury depends 
largely on the little crouton which is 
used as a foundation, and too much 
care cannot be taken in its preparation. 
Let your savouries be invariably hot.

Time 30 to 40 minutes. 
Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. 



No. iii2. SOUPS (Remarks on). 

Directions for soup wherever possible 
have been given for small quantities, as 
the ingredients can easily be doubled 
when more is required. 

Many persons are under the impres- 
sion that good soup cannot be made 
without fresh meat. If the recipes 
given are carefully followed, I think 
it will be found that this idea is a 
mistaken one, and that extremely 
palatable soups may be made of the 
bones and trimmings of joints, un- 
cooked bones being especially valuable. 

The principal points to be remem- 
bered are, to bring soup slowly to 
boiling point, and to simmer it gently, 
but continuously, for 4 or 5 hours, then 
immediately to strain off the stock 
through a fine sieve, and to set it aside 
until quite cold so that all the fat may 
be easily removed. If any fat is left 
in the stock, clearing is impossible. 
Sherry should be used only in small 
quantities. Clear soup is often served 
which tastes dangerously like hot sherry 
and water, and this is a most objection- 
able start to a dinner, and quite 
sufficient to spoil any one's appetite. 
Sherry of fairly good quality should be 
used. Raw, fiery "cooking sherry" is 
quite unsuitable, and the soup is much 
to be preferred without any wine at all. 



Thick soups must be carefully passed 
through a fine sieve and heated afresh. 
They must be rich and thick, but not 
so solid as to set in the plate. Except 
for milk soups arrowroot is much to be 
preferred as thickening to flour. An 
ounce of butter stirred into vegetable 
soups just before serving greatly im- 
proves their flavour. 



No. 1113. SOUP (Good, from Bones). 

Ingredients 

i quart stock No. 1125, or No. 1126,

No. 1124. STOCK (Remarks on). 

In every recipe for doing-up meat, it 
will be observed that stock is mentioned 
as preferable to water. It is better to 
use stock which is prepared rather than 
to make a hasty gravy from the trim- 
mings of the meat to be done up. To 
have a sufficient supply for this, as well 
as for soup, necessitates some care and 
trouble, but is not necessarily a large 
expense. If the bones and trimmings 
of meat and game are carefully set 
aside and boiled down while fresh, with 
some good vegetables, a constant order 
for gravy meat from the butcher's 
can be easily avoided. Raw bones 
can also be substituted with good 
effect. The stock, however, must be 
freshly made, and poured off, and the 
saucepan cleaned out. The odious and 
dirty practice of adding good and fresh 
meat to the refuse of a week's stock- 
pot is as unwholesome as it is wasteful. 
The original stock has often become 
tainted, and the whole is spoilt. It 
should be a standing rule that the 
stock is never left a night in the stew- 
pan ; 5 or 6 hours' gentle simmering 
will draw out all the good from soup 
and vegetables, and they are then done 
with, and should be disposed of after 
the stock has been carefully strained 
off. 

It should also be borne in mind 
that the stock-pot is not intended as a 
receptacle for every oddment the larder 
may furnish ; pieces of bread, fat, etc., 
do not improve the flavour or quality of 
stock. On the other hand, much may 



280 STOCK (FROM BONES) STOCK (FOR GAME GRAVIES) 



be done by a careful cook to improve 
the stock by materials at hand. The 
water in which a delicate-flavoured vege- 
table, such as asparagus, has been boiled, 
should be set aside in a clean basin, 
and used when cold, instead of plain 
water. Bones of game are valuable, 
however small, and should be used 
separately as a foundation for game 
gravy. 



No. 1125. STOCK (From Bones).

over a slow fire for 8 or 10 minutes 
until the meat is equally browned, 
moving them about with a wooden 
spoon that they may not burn ; then 
add the bones of the meat and the 
boiling water, and skim carefully, add- 
ing the cold water, a tea-cupful at a 
time, to encourage the throwing -up 
of the scum ; when no more scum 
appears, put in the vegetables, washed,

No. 1130. STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Ingredients 

12 Ibs. ripe strawberries, 6 Ibs. pre- 
serving sugar, i oz. isinglass. 



Method 

Remove the stalks, rejecting all un- 
sound fruit. Put the strawberries and 
sugar into a large bowl in alternate 
layers, and leave them for 12 hours. 
Turn them into a copper preserving- 
pan and boil them for i hour ; try a 
little on a plate, and a few minutes 
before it sets put \ pint of the jam 
into a saucepan, stir into it the isinglass 
until melted, then add it to the rest of

Sufficient for about 14 Ibs. jam. 



No. 1131. STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Ingredients 

1 8 strawberries, i quart clear wine 
jelly No. 243, or No. 670. 

Method 

Remove the stalks from the straw- 
berries. Have a jelly-mould with 6 
knobs, into each of which very gently 
press a strawberry, pour in a little jelly 
sufficient to form a setting for the 
fruit, and let set. When it is firm add 
more jelly to the depth of i inch. 
Let that set. Then lay in 4 or 5 straw- 
berries, pour in a little more jelly, but 
very carefully, or the fruit will float out 
of the knobs. Add fruit and jelly 
alternately in this manner until the 
mould is full. The filling of the 
mould must be effected extremely 
gradually, or the fruit will not be 
evenly distributed throughout the jelly. 
Care must also be taken that the 
fruit is not placed too closely together 
or the jelly will appear dull and heavy 
when turned out. In warm weather 
it is almost imperative to keep the 
mould on ice, or the jelly will not be 
firm. 

If ice cannot be obtained an extra 
| oz. of isinglass must be used. 
Sufficient for i -quart mould.

It's quite a HOME-MADE SOUP! 



EDWARDS' 



DESICCATED 



SOUP 



Made in 4 VARIETIES: Brown, White, Tomato, Gravina. 

FOR THE TABLE. 

If you like a good, tasty, HOME-MADE SOUP, you 
should use BROWN, WHITE, or TOMATO. They 
are made from home-grown vegetables and beef, and 
are simply delicious. Children thoroughly enjoy 
them, and we know of no soups at anything: like their 
price which bear any comparison with them. 

For a trial you can get a PENNY PACKET of any 
respectable grocer, but the larger sizes are more 
economical. 

FOR THE KITCHEN. 



QRAV1NA is particularly suited for enriching 
gravies, sauces, stews, rissoles, ragodts, minced 
collops, meat pies, hashes, etc., and indeed almost 
anything. It has an excellent flavour, and gives 
substance and piquancy wherever used. It Is very 
handy and economical in all kinds of cookery. It is 
a perfect gravy in itself, without any addition. Try 
it, and you will be surprised. 

If you cannot get the Soups, send to Fredk. KingSr Co., Ltd , 

3 Camomile Street, London, E.G. 

8 penny stamps for an 8d. tin of Brown, White, or Tomato. 
6 penny stamps for a 6d. tin of Gravina.
