The Vital Difference 



By C. H. Woodward 



"Wheat is wheat," said some one, "so why- 
should Whole Grain Wheat be superior to 
any other wheat product, or product made of 
wheat?" 

"Paper is paper," said another, "but if one 
piece has the Government's promise to pay- 
on it, it is money, but it is still paper." 

One paper possesses something the other 
paper lacks — and it makes a lot of difference. 

Whole Grain Wheat possesses something 
ill other wheats (or products made of wheat) 
lack — and it makes a vital difference. 

Take away from the paper the Govern- 
ment's promise to pay and it no longer func- 
tions as money. 

Take away from wheat any of the prom- 
ises Nature endowed it with and it no longer 
functions as food. 

And that is true of beans, 
and peas, and lentils and all 
other natural substances. 

THUMBPRINT products, 
Whole Grain Wheat, Whole 
Grain Rice, Whole Navy 
Beans, Whole Lima Beans, 
Whole Red Kidney Beans, 
Whole Lentils, Whole Ripe 
Peas, and Liquid Life all 
bear the thumbprint of Na- 
ture by which they are iden- 
tified as Natural foods for 
replenishment of the human 
bloodstream. 

They bear Nature's prom- 
ise to pay. 

These same foods when 
denatured do not bear Na- 
ture's promise, and are like 
the paper that lacks the Gov- 
ernment's promise to pay — 
it will not function as money. 
Denatured foods create 
disease, not because of what such foods con- 
tain, but because of what they lack. 

Denatured foods cause your teeth to decay ; 
they shorten your life ; they depreciate your 
mental and physical ability ; they stand in 
your way of achievement ; they double your 
cost of living and cheat you of your life at 
the same time. 

"Man cannot change the air he breathes, 
nor the water he drinks, nor the nature of 
the foods he eats, because his vital relations 
are forever fixed." — John Burroughs. 

Civilized man has unthinkingly tried to 



"My own experi- 
ments conducted 
with hundreds of 
albino rats of the 
Tyler strain con- 
clusively prove 
that Whole Grain 
Wheat surpasses 
in nutritive prop- 
erties any other 
Grain Food kinown 
to the American 
Public." 



change the nature of the food he eats, by 
separating it into parts and rejecting some 
and choosing others ; by cooking his food in 
the presence of oxygen and thereby denatur- 
ing it. These are the ways he changes the 
nature of his food, and this change brings 
disease with all the things that go with it, 
and death long before the appointed time. 
THUMBPRINT products are cooked 
ready to eat, but they are whole, natural 
substances and are not cooked in the pres- 
ence of oxygen. They are prepared and 
cooked under a patented process which 
prevents the loss of any element and thus 
prevents changing their nature. 

They have been demonstrated biologi- 
cally to produce the same nutritional effect 
as the raw, ripe, whole product which they 
originally were. 

These foods are not 
"cures" nor "remedies" in 
the sense usually understood, 
but more than 75 human 
ailments have disappeared 
out of the lives of users of 
THUMBPRINT products. 
These ailments disappear be- 
cause the individual quits 
creating the condition by 
substituting natural food for 
unnatural food. 



ALFRED W. McCANN 

Author of "Science of 
Eating" 



It costs less to be well 
than to be sick. Why not 
quit creating disease and 
start to get well and keep 
well through obeying the 
fixed laws of Nature which 
you are helpless to change 
or modify, instead of vio- 
lating them? 

Proofs are available out 
of the lives of more than 
100,000 people and proofs out of your own 
life will arise if you follow directions in 
the use of these foods. 

THUMBPRINT products are never sold 
through stores because they reduce the 
grocery bill, but directly to the consumer 
by our own sales organization, delivered 
for $2.00 per dozen; 4 dozen, $7.60.

MEASURES AND MEASURING 

The success of cookery lies very much in accurate meas- 
uring. 

Use standard measuring utensils, for success. 

y 2 pint is the standard measuring cup size. 

1 cup equals 16 tablespoonfuls. 

Yz cup equals 5 tablespoonfuls and 1 teaspoonful. 

Fractions of a cup should be measured with a tablespoon, 
using 4 for a quarter of a cup. 

1 tablespoon equals 3 teaspoonfuls. 

All measures should be level, unless otherwise stated. 
Dry materials should be put into the cup with a table- 
spoon and leveled with a spatula, not dipped with the cup. 

Liquids should be filled to the very top of the measure. 

Solid fats (lard or butter) should be packed solidly into 
the cup and cut level with the spatula.

Don't Skim Your Milk! 

Doctors Warn 



Because of the great and vital health 
value of whole cream milk, all doctors 
warn against skimming it. Doctor 
Herman N. Bundeson says, "The en- 
tire (whole) milk should be used, and 
the cream not removed, in order to 
obtain the benefits of its full food 




BOWMAN'S MILK is just 
such whole milk. Nothing is 
taken from it — nothing added 
to it. It comes to you just 
as rich in cream as when it 
was taken from the cow.

the pan with hot water. When the mixture becomes 
smooth with constant stirring, add the shrimp, veg- 
etables and garlic and seasonings. Cook until all water 
has evaporated, stirring constantly from the bottom to 
prevent sticking. When this stage has been reached, 
add one cup water, let boil up and remove from fire. 
Meanwhile, boil rice hard for twenty minutes, remove 
from fire, pour into colander and blanch with cold water. 
Drain, return to pot, cover tightly and allow to steam 
twenty minutes more. Each flake or rice should stand 
separate. Mound rice in center of serving dish, pour 
shrimp mixture over and around it and serve at once.

French Salad 
Dressing 



How Wright's French Salad 
Dressing Is Made 

The makers of Wright's French 
Salad Dressing have taken the finest 
salad oil, combined it with mellow, 
aged-in-the-wood vinegar, and added 
paprika, salt, sugar and spices. The 
ingredients are mixed in such a way 
that the dressing retains its Perfect 
blend and rich body. The result is a 
ready to use French Dressing, indes- 
cribably good and of a consistency 
that makes sure it will stay on the 
salad and not run off on the plate. 
Wright's French Salad Dressing is deli- 
cious on salads of lettuce, vegetables or 
fruits and as a sauce for meats and sea foods. 



Wright's French Salad Dressing is made by the manufacturers of 
Wright's Mayonnaise, Wright's Sandwich Spread and Wright's 
Thousand Island Dressing.

132 Ye Kirke Cookerie 



Custard 

1 qt. milk y 2 tablespoon vanilla or 

4 eggs nutmeg 

Yz cup sugar (For custard baked in 

Y\ tablespoon salt large mold use 6 eggs.) 

Scald the milk (use double boiler if possible.) Beat 
the eggs slightly, add sugar and salt. Gradually add hot 
milk to Ggg mixture, stirring constantly. Cook either 
as Baked or Thin Custard. 

Baked Custard 
Proceed as above. Pour the mixture into buttered 
custard cups or a baking dish. Set in a pan of warm 
water and bake in a slow oven. Test with a knife blade, 
when blade comes out clean remove from oven. Custard 
may be sprinkled with nuts or nutmeg before baking, to 
vary. 

Thin Custard 

Proceed as above. Cook in double boiler, stirring 
until mixture thickens and coats a metal spoon. Strain 
immediately, chill and flavor? If cooked too long the 
custard will curdle. Should this happen by using an 
egg-beater it may be restored to a smooth consistency, 
but custard will not be as thick. Eggs should be beaten 
slightly so that custard may be smooth. When eggs are 
expensive use 3 eggs and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. 

Thin custard may be used in many ways as a sauce — 
with stale cake, with fruit, with cocoanut added, or as 
a pudding sauce.

Dilute with six quarts ice water to one part lemon sirup 
and serve from a glass pitcher, garnishing if desired with 
thin slices of lemon or orange, maraschino, or sprigs of 
mint. Lemon syrup is convenient to take for picnics or 
in the automobile lunch basket. 

Plain lemonade is the basis of most ices and fruit 
drinks. Other fruit flavors may be added to the basic 
mixture as desired. 

Cherries, raspberries and blackberries all yield 
juices that are especially delicious as to flavor and lend 
a lovely color to a punch. Pineapple juice is liked by 
most people and a little goes a long way toward strength- 
ening the fruit mixture. Avoid getting drinks too sweet 
or filling them full of crushed or cut-up fruits. Thick 
mixtures are not easy to drink, nor are they so refresh- 
ing as those that are clear and zestful. Ginger ale or 
charged water gives an extra snap to fruit punch.

How to make Good Coffee 

Four things are essential — 

Chase & Sanborn's SEAL BRAND Coffee 
Freshly boiling water 
Clean coffee pot 
Exact measurements 

It is a splendid plan to have two coffee pots — a 
granite one for the making of coffee and a heavy china 



224 Ye Kirke Cookerie 



or earthenware pot for the serving of coffee. 

As soon as the coffee is made, strain into the earth- 
enware pot which has been scalded out with boiling 
water. Then empty the grounds from the granite coffee 
pot and fill it with water until time to wash it. This will 
keep the coffee pot clean and sweet and protect the fine 
flavor of the coffee. 

Rule for Making 

Proportion : 1 rounded tablespoonful of Chase & 
Sanborn's SEAL BRAND Ground coffee to 1 full cup of 
water. (Note: 1 full cup of water equals \y 2 cups filled 
to average depth and with space allowed for adding 
cream.) 

Place coffee in pot and add boiling water. Boil 
coffee and water together for five minutes, not longer. 
Pour out one cup to clear spout and pour back into pot. 
Now pour into pot a large tablespoonful of cold water 
and let stand for three minutes. This will force the 
grounds to the bottom. 

Crystal Clear Coffee 

Can be secured by the use of the white of an egg 
dissolved in water. The white of one Qgg will suffice for 
six or seven brewings. Save the yolk for other use. Do 
not throw the shell away, for the crushed shell in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water put into the pot after the 
brewing will clear it perfectly. 

The white of egg should be dissolved in a pint of 
cold water and kept in the ice box. Use two tablespoon- 
fuls of this mixture to clear each brewing, stirring it up 
each time before using. This should be added after the 
boiling stops. Then pour out one cup-ful (to clear the 
spout) pouring this back into the pot at once. Then let 
stand for a minute or two and serve immediately with 
good cream. 

This rule applies to the making of coffee in the 
ordinary coffee pot (which should be porcelain or gran- 



Beverages 225 



ite lined without filtering attachment of any kind). If 
you prefer a patent pot follow the rule accompanying it. 

Iced Coffee 

1 cupful finely ground Chase & Sanborn's SEAL 
BRAND Coffee. 

5 cupfuls boiling water 

2 tablespoonfuls cold water 

Proceed as given in the rule for making hot coffee. 
The above you will note will make a much stronger 
liquor. This is to allow for dilution by the melted ice. 
As soon as the coffee is clear fill glasses three-fourths 
full with cracked ice and after putting a spoon in the 
glass to prevent breakage, pour the hot coffee over the 
ice. Serve black or with cream and sugar, as may be per- 
ferred.
