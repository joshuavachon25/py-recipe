PREFACE 

A SCORE of years ago (1880-1885) I was living in the mountains of 
West Virginia. While riding on horseback through the dense forests of 
that great unfenced state, I saw on every side luxuriant growths of fungi, 
so inviting in color, cleanliness and flesh that it occurred to me they 
ought to be eaten. I remembered having read a short time before this 
inspiration seized me a very interesting article in the Popular Science 
Monthly for May, 1877, written by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, Jr., entitled 
"Toadstool Eating." Hunting it up I studied it carefully, and soon 
found myself interested in a delightful study which was not without im- 
mediate reward. Up to this time I had been living, literally, on the 
fat of the land bacon; but my studies enabled me to supplement this, 
the staple dish of the state, with a vegetable luxury that centuries ago 
graced the dinners of the Caesars. So absorbing did the study become 
from gastronomic, culinary and scientific points of view, that I have con- 
tinued it ever since, with thorough intellectual enjoyment and much 
gratification of appetite as my reward. I hope to interest students in 
the study as I am myself interested. 

For twenty years my little friends the toadstools have been my 
constant companions. They have interested me, delighted me, fed me, 
and I have found much pleasure in making the public acquainted with 
their habits, structure, lusciousness and food value. 

My researches have been confined to the species large enough to ap- 
pease the appetite of a hungry naturalist if found in reasonable quantity ; 
and my work has been devoted to segregating the edible and innocuous 
from the tough, undesirable and poisonous kinds. To accomplish this, 
because of the persistent inaccuracy of the books upon the subject, it 
was necessary to personally test the edible qualities of hundreds of 
species about which mycologists have either written nothing or have 
followed one another in giving erroneous information. While often 
wishing I had not undertaken the work because of the unpleasant results 



Preface 

from personally testing fungi which proved to be poisonous, my reward 
has been generous in the discovery of many delicacies among the more 
than seven hundred edible varieties I have found. 

For ten years I have planned to publish in book form what I know 
about toadstools ; each effort to compile my information has shown me 
how much more I ought to know before going into print. Even now 
my work is still unfinished. 

I am urged by my many toadstool friends (as I lovingly call those 
who, from all over the land, send me specimens for identification, and 
grow interested with me in the work), to publish what I already know 
upon the subject, that they, and others, may have a helpful book to 
guide them to a goodly portion of the edible species, and away from 
those that are inedible or poisonous. 

In this book I comply with these requests. I have selected over seven 
hundred of the most plentiful and best varieties for the table, from my 
toadstool bill of fare; and I describe and caution against several species, 
some of which are deadly in their effects, if eaten; others of which in- 
duce ill-effects more or less serious. One thousand species and varieties 
are named and described. 

Birds, flowers, insects, stones delight the observant. Why not toad- 
stools? A tramp after them is absorbing, study of them interesting, 
and eating of them health-giving and supremely satisfying.

INTRODUCTION 



AMERICA is without a text-book of the American species of Fungi, 
among which the edible and poisonous varieties are found. Many 
excellent but expensive foreign volumes describe species common to 
both continents, and several special but widely scattered monographs 
have been published here. The need of the mycologist, mycophagist 
and amateur toadstool student is a book giving the genus, names and 
descriptions of the prominent American toadstools whose edibility has 
been tested, or whose poisonous qualities have been discovered. The 
absence of such a book, and the universal and rapidly-growing interest 
all over the United States in edible fungi, have led to the publication of 
the present work, which includes every species known to be esculent in 
North America. As a precautionary measure, full explications of all 
those known or suspected to be poisonous are included. 

Many species found in this country only have been described and 
named by various authors, from the time of Schweinitz (1822) to the 
present day. These have been published in the botanical magazines 
and in the papers of scientific societies and colleges. The greater num- 
ber have as author Professor Charles H. Peck, New York State Botanist, 
who has contributed an annual report each year from 1868. These 
appear in the reports of the State Museum of New York, and coming 
from the pen of our ablest mycologist are of great value to everyone 
interested in the study. The classifications and (in many instances) 
modified descriptions by such an eminent authority upon fungoid growth 
should therefore be the guides to American forms, that the confusion 
created by numerous descriptions of the same fungus by different ob- 
servers may be avoided. 

Professor N. L. Britton, editor of the Torrey Botanical Club, has 
courteously given permission to use the descriptions of new species 
given in its instructive Bulletins. 

Professor A. P. Morgan and Laura V. Morgan, with equal courtesy,

Introduction 

grant the use of text and illustrations contained in the most complete 
monograph published upon the Lycoperdaceae (puff-balls, etc.) of 
America. 

While the scientific classifications and descriptions have been strictly 
followed, the language has been simplified with no sacrifice of scientific 
accuracy that this volume may be fully adapted to popular use. 

Professor Peck has given his valuable assistance in the identification 
of many species, all that were difficult or obscure having been submitted 
to him, and the writer is deeply indebted to him for many and long- 
continued courtesies, aiding in study and in the preparation of this work. 

Several new species have been found by the writer, the greater part 
of excellent food value. He preferred that these should be named, de- 
scribed and placed in their proper genus and section by Professor Peck, 
believing it to be best for the discoverers of new species to defer to one 
whose vast experience enables him to name and classify in accordance 
with the demands of American species. 

Where a species is vouched for as edible, it has been personally tested 
by the author and his willing undertasters up to eating full meals of it, 
or at least beyond all doubt as to its safety. Where others have eaten 
species which he has not had the opportunity to test, their names and 
opinions are given. When species heretofore under the ban of suspicion 
are in this volume, for the first time, announced to be edible (there are 
many of them), personal tests have not been considered sufficient, as 
idiosyncrasy might have affected the results. Others, at the writer's re- 
quest, have eaten of the species until their innocence was fully established. 
In some cases, where the reputation of the fungi eaten was especially bad, 
scientists of note have made elaborate and exhaustive physiological tests 
of their substances, and in every instance* confirmed the human testing. 

While species which contain deadly poisons are few, their individuals 
are produced in great number. Nicety in distinguishing their botanic 
variance from edible species closely resembling them is necessary. No 
charm will detect the poison. Eating toadstools before their certain 
identification as belonging to edible species, is neither bravery nor 
common sense. The amateur should go slow. 

The question often asked is : By what rule do you distinguish between 
edible and poisonous mushrooms? The answer usually surprises the 
questioner there is no general rule. All such rules which have been 
given are false and unreliable. The quality of each was learned, one at

Introduction 

a time. Sweet and sour apples alike grow on large and small trees, may 
be red or green, large or small, oblong or globular, and no visible ap- 
pearance gives the least clue to the quality. 

In a few genera certain rules may be applied, as in Clavaria all not 
bitter or tough are edible. But such generalizations are each limited to 
its own genus. 

The toadstools containing deadly poisons are thought to be confined 
to one genus of the gilled kind Amanita, and to Helvella esculenta, 
now Gyromitra esculenta, to which are charged fatal results. The 
poisonous qualities of Gyromitra esculenta are not proven. Recent 
testings of this species prove it to be harmless and of good quality. By 
far the greater number of species contained in Amanita are notable for 
their tender substance and delicious flavor. By their stately beauty and 
unusual attractiveness both the poisonous and harmless kinds are seduc- 
tive. Any toadstool with white or lemon-yellow gills, casting white 
spores when laid gills downward upon a sheet of paper, having rem- 
nants of a fugitive skin in the shape of scabs or warts upon the upper 
surface of its cap, with a veil or ring, or remnants or stains of one, hav- 
ing at the base of its stem in the ground a loose, skin-like sheath sur- 
rounding it, or remnants of one, should never be eaten until the collector 
is thoroughly conversant with the technicalities of every such species, or 
has been taught by one whose autJiority is well known , that it is a harm- 
less species. This rule purposely includes the renowned Amanita Cas- 
saria, everywhere written as luscious. I regard it as the most dangerous 
of toadstools, because of its close resemblance to its sister plant the 
Amanita muscaria which is deadly. In the description of these spe- 
cies, other forcible reasons are given. 

Another deadly species the Amanita phalloides is frequently mis- 
taken by the inexperienced for the common mushroom. Safety lies in 
the strict observance of two rules : Never eat a toadstool found in the 
woods or shady places, believing it to be the common mushroom. 
Never eat a white- or yellow-gilled toadstool in the same belief. The 
common mushroom does not grow in the woods, and its gills are at first 
pink, then purplish-brown or black. 

If through carelessness, or by accident, a poisonous Amanita has 
been eaten, and sickness results, take an emetic at once, and send for a 
physician with instructions to bring hypodermic syringe and atropine 
sulphate. The dose is y^-g- of a grain, and doses should be continued

Introduction 

heroically until the -$ of a grain is administered, or until, in the phy- 
sician's opinion, a proper quantity has been injected. Where the vic- 
tim is critically ill the -jV of a grain may be administered. 

In every case of toadstool poisoning, the physician must be guided 
by the symptoms exhibited. Professor W. S. Carter, by numerous 
exhaustive trials upon animals, has proved that atropine, while valuable 
as against the first, is not an antidote for the late effects of the greater 
toadstool poisons. (See his chapter on toadstool poisons, especially 
prepared for this work.) 

There are other species which contain minor poisons producing very 
undesirable effects. These are soon remedied by taking an emetic, 
then one or two doses of whisky and sweet oil; or vinegar may be 
substituted for the whisky. A few species of fungi are innocuous to 
the majority of persons and harmful to a few. So it is with many 
common foods strawberries, apples, tomatoes, celery, even potatoes. 
The beginner at toadstool eating usually expects commendation for 
bravery, and fearfully watches for hours the coming of something 
dreadful. Indigestion from any other cause is always laid to the tradi- 
tionary enemy, fright ensues, a physician is called, the scare spreads, 
and a pestilential story of " Severe Poisoning by Toadstools," gets into 
the newspapers. The writer has traced many such publications to im- 
prudences in eating, with which toadstools had nothing to do. 

The authoritative analysis of several common food species by La- 
fayette B. Mendel, of Sheffield Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, 
Yale University, is given, and will correct the popular error about the 
great nutritive value of fungi, arising from previous erroneous analyses. 

While species are reported as found in certain localities, it by no 
means follows that their growth is confined to these places. A species 
reported as found in the Adirondack mountains, unless belonging to the 
few peculiar to northern regions and high altitudes, is reasonably sure 
to be more plentiful in a like habitat south and west of them. South 
it will appear earlier and its season last longer . 

Size is largely dependent upon latitude and may vary greatly in the 
same group. Temperature, moisture, favorable nourishment are im- 
portant factors in growth. 

Each species has its favorite habitat, and will thrive best upon it. 
There are few things under the sun upon which fungi do not grow. 
Their mission is particularly directed toward converting decaying mat-

Introduction 

ter, or matter which has accomplished its work in one direction, into 
usefulness in another. They are the wood-choppers, stewards, caterers 
of the forest, converters in the fields and chemists everywhere. They 
can not assimilate inorganic matter because of the absence of chlorophyl 
in their composition, but in organic matter they are omnivorous. When 
they feed on dead substances they are called saprophytes ; when their 
support is derived from living tissues, parasites. 

Scores of species of fungi were found in the forests, ravines and clear- 
ings of the West Virginia mountains from 1881 to 1885 inclusive, and 
eaten by the writer years before he had the opportunity to learn their 
names from books or obtain the friendly assistance of experts in identi- 
fying them. He knew the individuals without knowing their names, as 
one knows the bird song and plumage before formal introduction to the 
pretty creatures that charm him. 

After he was able to get European publications upon the subject, and 
by their aid trace the species he had eaten to their names, descriptions 
and qualities, he was surprised to read that many of them were warned 
against as deadly. As informed by these books, he properly ought to 
have died several times. It soon became evident that authors had fol- 
lowed one another in condemning species, some because they bore brill- 
iant hues, others because they were unpleasant when raw (just as is a 
potato), rather than investigate their qualities by testing them. Here 
was a realm of food-giving plants almost entirely unexplored. The 
writer determined to explore it. Instead of the one hundred and eleven 
species then recorded by the late Doctor Curtis as edible, my number 
of edible species now exceeds his by over six hundred.* 

Let us clear away the rubbish and superstition that have so long ob- 
scured the straight path to a knowledge of edible toadstools. Let us 
bear in mind that a mushroom is a toadstool and a toadstool is a mush- 
room the terms are interchangeable. If toads ever occupied the one- 
legged seat assigned them from time immemorial, they have learned in 

* This book contains one hundred and fifty pages more than were originally esti- 
mated and promised to the subscribers. That all known edible and poisonous species 
might be fully described and published within one volume, the author was compelled 
to cut fifly thousand words from his manuscript. The localities from which species 
have been reported and the names of the reporters have been taken out, excepting 
where it was desirable to show that foreign species have been found in the United 
States, and where tested species have been found by the author. The principal cut 
has been from the notes of the author and of enlarged descriptions.

Introduction 

this enlightened age that the ground is much more reliable, and so squat 
upon it, except when exercising their constitutional right to hop. Snails, 
slugs, insects of many kinds, mice, squirrels and rabbits prey upon good 
and bad, each to its liking, notwithstanding oft-repeated assertion that 
snails and slugs infect noxious varieties only, or that animals select the 
innocuous only. We are warned against those which grow in the dark 
or damp ; the mushroom of commerce is grown by the ton in the sub- 
terranean quarries of France, and everywhere in vaults and cellars for 
domestic use. The valued truffle never sees the light until it is taken 
from darkness to be eaten, and other varieties of the best prefer seclu- 
sion. 

The wiseacres tell us that they must have equal gills, must not have 
thin tops, must not turn yellow when sprinkled with salt, must not 
blacken a silver spoon, that we must not eat of those changing color 
when cut or broken, of those exuding milk, or those which are acrid, 
hot, or bitter, and give many other specifics for determining the good 
from the bad. These tests are all worse than worthless, for if confidence 
is placed in them they will not only lead us away from esculent and 
excellent varieties but directly into eating venomous ones. 

There are whole genera of fungi which are innocuous ; but in the 
Family of Agaricaceae, where the greatest variety of the edible and poison- 
ous species are found, it is necessary to master one by one the details 
of their construction and learn to distinguish their differences as one 
does those of the many kinds of roses, or pinks, or hundreds of bright- 
faced pansies, and in the mastery of them lies the only charm that will 
safely guide. 

Carefully remove the first toadstool found from whatever it is growing 
upon, and with it a portion of that from which it springs. If it is the 
earth a curious white network is discernible, fine as the delicate spin- 
ning of the spider, spreading its meshes throughout the mass. It will 
often remind of miniature vines climbing over miniature lattices. This 
is the mycelium from which the toadstool grew. In many instances it 
penetrates the earth to a considerable depth, and takes possession of 
large territory. It is often seen as the gardener turns up the soil or its 
fertilizer, and is perhaps taken for a mold. If the specimen is gathered 
from mat of wood leaves, the same white vine is observable slipping in 
between its layers. If taken from a tree, the decay ing wood is traversed

Introduction 

by it. From wherever a toadstool is plucked, it is removed from its 
mycelium. 

This mycelium is but a thread-like mass of simple cells joined 
together at their ends and interlacing in a way a thousand-fold more 
intricate than a Chinese puzzle. Nothing in its structure indicates what 
its special product will be. The fungus which, is plucked from it is in 
all its parts simply a mass of these threads cells strung together, in- 
terlacing and ramifying. 

When the season favors, the mycelium which has, winter and sum- 
mer and from year to year, lived its hidden life, or has sprung from a 
germinating spore develops a number of its cells in a minute knob, 
small as a pin head. At this point the cells make special growth 
efforts to bring themselves within the favoring influences of heat and 
moisture; this tiny knob labors within itself, producing cell after cell, 
which takes shape and function for the future toadstool. 

As it rapidly enlarges it pushes its way toward the surface of the 
ground, becomes more or less egg-shaped in this stage of its growth, 
and if cut in half longitudinally and examined, it will display what it is 
going to be when it grows up. 

Suppose that it belongs to the first of the two great sections into 
which fungi are divided under the classification of Fries, who modified 
that of Persoon. The first has the spores which represent the seeds 
in plants naked, and it is called sporifera or spore-bearing. The sec- 
ond, which has the spores enclosed in cells or cysts, is called sporidifera 
or sporidia-bearing. If the cap of a gill-bearing toadstool be laid, gills 
downward, on a watch crystal or piece of white paper for a few hours, 
or, in some instances, a few minutes, a complete representation of the 
spaces between the gills will be found deposited as an impalpable pow- 
der. These are the spores. 

The first section is divided into four cohorts. Two of these have 
hymeniums or spore-bearing surfaces more or less expanded. These 
are Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes. In Hymenomycetes the 
hymenium is always exposed in matured plants, as with the common 
mushroom. When young, some plants are covered with a membrane. 
In Gastromycetes the hymenium is always concealed within a covering 
which bursts at maturity, as with the Lycoperdons or puff-balls. Cohort 
Coniomycetes includes rusts, smuts, etc., formed for the most part on 
living plants. There is no hymenium present. The spores are produced 

xv 



Introduction 

on the ends of inconspicuous threads, free or enclosed in a bottle-like 
receptacle called a perithecium. Cohort Hypomycetes is composed 
of those species of fungi commonly called molds. The spores are 
produced, naked, from the ends of inconspicuous threads. 

In the Agaricaceae the first family in Hymenomycetes the young 
plant is completely enveloped. (Plate III, fig. B, p. 2.) Its head is 
as yet undefined and its body may be classed as dumpy, but shut in 
and protected are a great quantity of knife-like plaits (Plate III, fig. C., 
p. 2), on the outer surface of which, when the plant matures, will be 
borne its spores. It therefore belongs to the Hymenomycetes, and to 
the Family Agaricaceae gill-bearing. 

If the ground becomes moist or there comes a heavy dew or a rain, 
the young plant, closely compacted and very solid, which has been 
under the surface for many days waiting its chance to get forth to light 
and air, rapidly swells, breaks through the moistened earth, goes 
rapidly to cell-making, ruptures its outside covering, the head expands 
and in so doing spreads out its gills or hymenium. (Plate III, figs. C, 
D, E, p. 2.) The membrane which covered the gills either vanishes, 
or gathers round the stem in the form of a ring or circular apron, or it 
may partially adhere to the edges of the top, cap or pileus and hang as 
a fringe from it ; the stem elongates ; the whole plant assumes the colors 
of its species and in a few hours or days at most it stands forth, a 
marvel of beauty, structure and workmanship. 

But little is known of how these spores reproduce themselves. The 
microscope fails to completely penetrate the mystery. A whole fungus 
is but a mass of cells, the spore is but one of them. That these simple 
cells do produce after their kind there is no doubt, but so minute is the 
germ and hidden its methods that science has failed to solve them. 

The first Family of Hymenomycetes is Agaricaceae. Its members 
always have gills or modifications of them. In some cases notably in 
Cantharellus the gills have the appearance of smooth, raised veins 
over which is the spore-bearing surface. The hymenium is but an 
extension of the fibers of the cap, folded up like the plaits and flutings 
of ruffles, and laundered with exquisite neatness. If it is carefully 
detached and spread out like a fan it will cover a large surface, many 
times the size of the cap from which it has been taken, and will show 
that what is a consumption of material in dress ornamentation is 
utilized by economical Dame Nature to increase the spore-bearing

Introduction 

surface within a small space and for purely business purposes spore- 
bearing. The color of these spores has much to do with the classifica- 
tion. The microscope with high light reveals the delicate shades of 
their coloring, but the main colors are readily distinguished by the 
naked eye when the spores are collected in a mass on glass or paper. 

The Polyporaceae have in place of gills closely packed tubes on the 
inside of which is the spore-bearing surface ; each has a mouth from 
which to eject the spores. 

The Hydnaceae bear their spores from spines or spicules of various 
length protruding from the external surface of the cap. Sometimes the 
spines mock in miniature the stalactites of the Caverns of Luray, some- 
times the shaggy mane of the lion, sometimes flowing locks of hair. 
These three Families belong to the Cohort Hymenomycetes, having 
their spore-bearing surface exposed early in life by the rupture of the 
universal veil. 

The Lycoperdons or Puff-balls have the hymenium enclosed within an 
outer case, just as the apple with its seeds is enclosed for a dumpling. 
When the spores are matured the sack is ruptured and they escape as 
the dusty powder so well known to all. The Puff-ball belongs to the 
Cohort Gastromycetes, because its spores are protected within the hy- 
menium until they are matured. 

There are other Families which contain edible species. The Clavar- 
iaceae branched or club-shaped often found in as beautiful forms as 
delight us in coral, includes a few. 

In Ascomycetes, of the covered spore division Sporidifera, there are 
several species which are excellent, and as they dry readily are much 
valued for flavoring purposes when winter forbids the growth of outdoor 
fungi. Of these the Morell has preference. The cap is covered with 
sinuosities and pits which bear the spores. There are several varieties 
of the Morell in the United States. They are known among the coun- 
try people who cook and pickle them, as Honey-comb mushrooms. 

The Tuberaceae are subterranean fungi. The common truffle so 
much prized by epicures is a good representative. It is found a foot or 
more under the surface of the earth, and of such value is it that in some 
countries pigs are trained to hunt it from its hiding place. It is one of 
the few foreign growths apparently not taking kindly to our country. 
Efforts have been made to import and cultivate it, but without success.

Introduction 

It is possible, even probable, that it may yet be found in America by 
assiduous search. 

I have said that there is but one way to distinguish the edible from 
the non-edible fungi ; that is by mastering the characteristics of each 
species one by one. There are signs which point to the evil and those 
which point to the good, but they must be used as signals, not directors. 

A nauseous, fetid odor should condemn a species as non-edible at 
once. Those having the flavor of flour or fresh meal are generally 
accepted as worthy of trial. Slimy, water-soaked, partially decom- 
posed plants, or those impressing one as unpleasant in any way, should 
never find their place upon the table. Do not eat of any toadstool, 
unknown to the collector, beyond the careful and systematic testing 
required to determine whether it is edible or not. 

A few species have a serious charge remaining against them ; that of 
partiality. They unmistakably signify with whom they will agree and 
with whom they will not. These are notably Clitocybe illudens, Lepiota 
Morgani, Panaeolus papilionaceus, all specialized in their places in the 
text. 

Other species have hereditary taints upon their reputations. Most, 
if not all of them have stood present tests and relieved themselves of 
suspicion. But, alas that it should be so ! The stigma must rest upon 
them for yet a while and until their defenders are so numerous that their 
purity, without a smirch, is popularly proclaimed. 

Wherever wood grows and decays as it will, Polyporus, Panus, Len- 
zites, Schizophyllum and kindred genera stand prominently forth in 
countless numbers. The great majority of them are inedible because of 
their woody substance. A few are valued as food. Very many of them 
yield their soluble matter and flavor when boiled, and in this way make 
excellent soups and gravies, just as flax-seed and the bark of the slip- 
pery elm yield succulent matter. These, however, are not, with a few 
exceptions, mentioned in this book. Numbers of Clavarieae and Hyd- 
neae are in the same category. M. C. Cooke tersely says: "Fruits 
that are not peaches or apricots maybe very good plums." In the in- 
troductions to genera their attributes are given; under "Instructions to 
Students" every guide to identification and selection will be found. 

A Glossary, containing the botanic terms used in this book and, it is 
believed, all other terms used by mycologists in describing fungi, follows 
the descriptive text. It is strongly advised that it be carefully studied. 



Introduction 

The roots and derivatives of the botanic terms are fully and carefully 
given by Dr. John W. Harshberger, professor of botany, University of 
Pennsylvania, to whom the author is specially indebted. 

The excellent Glossary published by Dr. Edwin A. Daniels, Boston, 
has furnished many comprehensive definitions. It is the property of 
the Boston Mycological Club, and can be obtained from its secretary 
for twenty-five cents. 

The determination of the proper accentuation of the generic and spe- 
cific terms has been in many cases a difficult task, and, in some cases, 
owing to the dubious origin of the words in question, there is certainly 
room for difference of opinion. This task has been kindly and con- 
scientiously performed by Prof. M. W. Easton, professor of Compara- 
tive and English Philology, University of Pennsylvania. Thanks are 
due to the Hon. Addison Brown, president of the Torrey Botanical 
Club, and Dr. Nathaniel L. Britton, professor of Botany in Columbia 
College, authors of " Illustrated Flora," for the determination of the 
accentuation of non-classical words ending in imis. 

Three indexes are given : the first refers to the general contents, the 
second to the genera, the third to species and their genera, alphabetic- 
ally arranged. 

Mrs. Emma P. Ewing and Mrs. Sarah T. Rorer have kindly furnished 
some of their recipes for the preparation of several varieties of toad- 
stools. The best results of the author's long experience in cooking 
toadstools are given in the chapter ' ' Recipes for Cooking and Prepar- 
ing for the Table," together with others selected from many sources. 
The personal taste of the server must be guide to the choice. 

A child-friend of the writer, in telling him of her mother's cook, said : 
" She's a good cooker, but she has a bad temper." A good "cooker" 
will soon learn how to best display the individual flavor of each species. 
And be it known that each species of toadstool has a flavor of its own. 
These flavors vary as much as among meats and vegetables. No one 
species can be taken as standard of excellence. 

The greatest care has been taken to secure illustrations correct in 
every botanic detail. With few exceptions the colored figures were 
drawn and painted by the writer. To obtain this important feature the 
requirements of art have frequently been sacrificed. An artist can make 
a picture of a toadstool ; the mycologist must guide his brush or pencil 
in the making of a correct presentation. The happy combination of 



Introduction 

artist and mycologist occurs in Mr. Val. W. Starnes, Augusta, Ga., to 
whom this volume owes many of its illustrations. Mr. Frank D. Bris- 
coe, widely known as an artist of rare ability, has arranged and painted 
in groups the studies made by the writer from typical plants, and added 
to the illustrations many excellent drawings of his own. 

The unfailing reliability of the sun has been masterfully used by Dr. 
J. R. Weist, ex-Secretary of the American Society of Surgeons, Rich- 
mond, Ind. ; H. I. Miller, Superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis 
Railroad, Terre Haute, Ind., and Mr. Luther G. Harpel, Lebanon, Pa., 
in making the unexcelled photographs generously contributed by them. 
The author is most thankful to them and to Mr. C. G. Lloyd, Cincin- 
nati, Ohio a scientific gentleman devoting lavishly of his time and 
money to the spread of mycological knowledge for the privilege of 
selecting from his extensive collection of realistic photographs those 
adaptable to the species described herein. 

The author's thanks are gratefully given to the many who have by 
help and encouragement furthered his efforts in producing this, the 
first American text-book upon fungi. Space precludes the naming of 
the many, but the few named do not outrank them in their interest, help 
and the author's appreciation: 

Miss Lydia M. Patchen, President of the Westfield, N. Y., Toadstool 
Club (the first in America); Mrs. E. C. Anthony, Thomas J. Collins, 
E. B. Sterling, Berry Benson, Melvil Dewey, New York State Librarian; 
Dr. J. E. Schadle, Prof. J. P. Arnold, University of Pennsylvania; 
Prof. W. S. Carter, University of Texas; Boston School of Natural 
History; Massachusetts Horticultural Society; Prof. Wm. G. Farlow, 
University of Harvard. 

Thus aided the author believes that his own conscientious, patient, 
loved labor in the study of edible and non-edible fungi and the produc- 
tion of this volume will be far-reaching in its one object encouraging 
the study of toadstools. 

The time for writing a complete flora of the United States has not 
yet come ; a large part of the country remains as yet unexplored by 
mycologists ; new species are being constantly discovered in the districts 
best known. Every book on the subject must be necessarily incomplete. 

On the other hand, so far as concerns the known fungus-flora, there 
is imperative need of some guide to the student, which shall at least 
save him some part of the weary toil of hunting through the scattered

Introduction 

literature in which alone, as things are at present, can be found the in- 
formation he seeks. In this book I have tried to meet this need. It is 
not complete, but I have tried to so arrange the matter that the student 
can always decide whether the particular specimen in hand is or is not 
included, and, at least for all of our more conspicuous fungi, determine 
the family and genus. If the student can do so much, the task of find- 
ing the specific name, even when not included in this book, becomes 
very much simpler. 

So much for the more scientific aspect of my book. But I have 
also kept in constant view the needs of the large and constantly growing 
number of persons who have no aim further than to learn to know the 
principal toadstools seen in their walks, just as they wish to know the 
principal trees and the more conspicuous birds. For such as these, the 
difficulty of deciding whether or no a particular individual fungus is 
described in the brief (sketching) manuals hitherto accessible is even 
more formidable than with the special student of botany. 

Finally, I have kept in view throughout the work the needs of the 
mycophagists. They are not pot-hunters; they care much less for the 
physical pleasure of the appetite than for the close study of Nature 
that their inclination leads them into. Some day the delights of a 
mushroom hunt along lush pastures and rich woodlands will take the 
rank of the gentlest craft among those of hunting, and may perchance 
find its own Izaak Walton. 

AUTHOR'S AND PUBLISHER'S NOTE. 

It is the intention of the author and the publisher to keep this book 
up to date. Recognizing that future testing will prove many more 
species of toadstools to be edible, and that scientists will have more 
exact knowledge of toadstool poisons and their antidotes, they announce 
that illustrated sheets publishing new edible species and current informa- 
tion upon fungi will be, from time to time, issued, conforming in shape 
and style to this volume and at an acceptable price. 

That the author and publishers may keep in touch with the owner of 
each volume, and be informed of new discoveries in species and of new 
experience, owners are requested to communicate their book numbers 
to Captain Charles Mcllvaine, or the Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis.

INSTRUCTIONS TO STUDENTS 



To CATCH fish one must know more than the fish ; to find toadstools 
one must know their season and habitats. They are propagated by their 
spores and from their mycelium that web-like growth which is the re- 
sult of spore germination. 

The spores of ground-growing kinds, when shed upon the ground, 
are washed by rains along the natural drainage ; therefore, when a speci- 
men of one of these kinds is found, it is well to look up and down the 
natural water-shed, and follow it. Good reward will usually come of it. 
Few fungi are strictly solitary. 

Careful observation of the habitats of the various genera and species 
will enable the student to know what may and may not be expected in 
a particular locality, and will save many a hunt. 

When an unknown species is found, collect it carefully, examine it 
closely, note all its features. Determine to which division of fungi it 
belongs. If to the gilled family (Agaricaceae) obtain the color of the 
spores (see directions). Look at the chart "Tabular View of Genera 
of Agaricaceae," Plate I, p. 2 (after W. G. Smith, but enlarged, redrawn 
and emended). If the spores are white, it belongs to one of the genera 
in the first column Leucosporae; if pink, to one in the second column, 
and so on. It is often difficult to determine the spore color, because 
spores vary through many shades of the typical color. What are called 
white spores may be creamy, dirty, yellowish or brownish-white ; pink 
spores will vary from almost white to reddish and salmon-color ; brown 
spores from light-ochraceous through cinnamon to rusty ; purple spores 
from dark-violet to purplish-black. Experience alone will enable the 
student to decide which color series is present. The Genera Charts, pre- 
ceding the five different color series, show typical spore colors only. 
Again, authors describing the species frequently fail to see colors alike; 
if they do, their names for them frequently vary. For instance, few 
persons will agree upon a color expressed as " livid." 

xxiii 



Instructions to Students 

The color system principally used by botanists is Saccardo's "Chro- 
motaxia," costing fifty cents. It is decidedly inadequate. Ridgway's 
"Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists" is far better, but it is out of 
print and obtainable only at the principal libraries. "The Prang Stand- 
ard of Color" is the most complete ever issued, but it is inapplicable to 
existing descriptions of fungi. 

Take, to print upon, sheets of Bristol-board or any stiff, hard-sur- 
T M , . faced white paper 6x9 inches or larger. Cut a round 
Preserve hole, four inches in diameter, in one of the sheets. Use 

this as a stencil. Lay it upon a print-sheet and where 
the opening occurs, paint with a weak solution of gum arabic H oz. 
(one teaspoonful) to one pint of water. Dry the print-sheets. 

When a spore-print is to be taken, select a fully-grown specimen, re- 
move the stem, place the spore-bearing surface upon the gummed 
paper, cover tightly with an inverted bowl or saucer, and allow to stand 
undisturbed for eight or ten hours. The moisture in the plant will 
soften the gummed surface ; the spores will be shed and will adhere to 
it, making a perfect, permanent print. When the print is plain, remove 
the specimen carefully and dry the print. Number the print-cards to 
correspond with the number of the specimen in the "Record of Fungi," 
and place them in a box or cover. Some genera shed their spores sooner 
and more freely than others. A surplus of spores is objectionable. In 
order to know when a print is plainly made, without disturbing the 
process, have either a specimen of the same age, or a piece of the one 
under the bowl, on another piece of gummed paper, covered in like 
manner. This can be examined and will give the desired information. 
A little experience will enable the student to obtain good and lasting 
prints. 

The large black figures on some calendars, if cut with the white about 
them, are convenient as trial sheets for spore-printing. Lay the speci- 
men partly on the white, partly on the black. If the spores are light, 
they show best on black ground, and if colored, they show best on the 
light. 

Spore measurements, as given by different observers, vary to such a 
degree that they are of little value, excepting as determining a few 
species, but spore shapes and characteristics are of use as a last resort, 
in accurate determinations. A microscope of considerable power is 
needed.

logical publications.

The spore color being determined, turn to the Genera Chart, showing 
Use of Charts spores of like color. Ascertain from the specimen whether 
of Genera. or no t j S ca p or hymenophore is distinct or easily sep- 

arable from the stem and the gills free from the stem; if they are, it 
may belong to one of the genera in the upper row of figures ; if the cap 
is not easily separable nor the gills free, look at the shape of the gills, 
and find on the chart a corresponding gill-shape. It is probable that 
the genus can thus be determined. Then turn to this genus in the text, 
read the heading, look over the "Analysis of Tribes," go to the tribe 
nearest in designating the properties of the specimen ; comparing the 
specimen with the descriptions of species given thereunder, will probably 
enable the seeker to decide upon its name. 

It should be remembered that the descriptions in the text are of the 

xxv 



Instructions to Students 

specimen or specimens which the author of the species saw. What the 
author says fixes the type of the species. Specimens of the species 
may, and very frequently do, vary greatly from the type. If the first 
attempt to fix the genus is not satisfactory, try again, and keep on try- 
ing until reasonably sure. The amateur will find, however good an 
opinion may exist in his mind of the stock of patience on hand, that the 
territory of patience has just been reached. 

An excellent blank form for "Collectors' Notes" is published by the 
Maki , Boston Mycological Club, at one cent. It is desirable 

Preserving: that there should be uniformity in collectors' notes, and 
Notes 

that they should be as full as possible. A form of this, or 

a similar kind, should be filled in and kept, and should also be used 
when specimens are sent to an expert for identification. Such specimens 
should be fresh, wrapped separately in tissue paper, numbered, and a 
few should be packed in a box that will not crush in the mail. The 
address of the sender should be upon the outside. The collector's 
notes should be sent in a letter, with a postage stamp for reply enclosed. 
If the specimens have to go a great distance, they should be partially 
dried in a slow, open oven, or they will be a rotten mass when they 
reach their destination. 

There is but one way by which to determine the edibility of a species. 
To Test ^ ^ ^^ s an d smells inviting, and its species can not be 

Edibility of determined, taste a very small piece. Do not swallow it. 

Q|k/lSfjS}Q 

Note the effect on the tongue and mouth. But many 
species, delicious when cooked, are not inviting raw. Cook a small 
piece; do not season it. Taste again; if agreeable eat it (unless it is 
an Amanita). After several hours, no unpleasant effect arising, cook a 
larger piece, and increase the quantity until fully satisfied as to its 
qualities. Never vary from this system, no matter how much tempted. 
No possible danger can arise from adhering firmly to it. Recipes for 
preparing, cooking and serving are given in chapter on cooking. 

It is better for the student to first become familiar with the common 
species, one at a time, than to attempt tracing the rare or many. 
Worry, fatigue and uncertainty are plentiful in an indiscriminate gather- 
ing of fungi. One species a day, properly traced and named, means 
learning three hundred and sixty-five species a year. 



XXVI 



Instructions to Students 

Unfamiliar terms will be encountered in the descriptive text. The 

Glossary defines them ; and not only those in this book, 
The Glossary. . . . .. , , . , , 

but, it is believed, all those found in other books upon 

fungi. Where possible throughout the text, botanical terms have been 
anglicized. The meanings of those remaining unchanged should be 
memorized. It is quite as easy, and far better, to learn the botanical 
names of species and their characteristics, as to learn their common 
names; easier in fact, for the common names often vary with locality. 
The writer received a letter from an Alsatian living in St. Louis, telling 
him of favorite fungi he used to eat when in his own country. To all 
he gave local names, not one of which could be referred to the particu- 
lar species meant. 

Success and pleasure in the study of fungi will attend the student 
who observes carefully and who systematically records that which is 
observed.

UNGI composed of membranes, fleshy, woody or gelatin- 
ous, growing on wood or on the ground. The hymenium 
or spore-bearing surface exposed at an early stage. The 
spores are borne on basidia, spread over the surface. 
The common mushroom is typical of the family. All the 
members resemble it, more or less, in organization and reproductive 
organs. These latter, in the mushroom, are spread over lamella; or 
gills. The spores, after ripening and dissemination, germinate and 
produce a mycelium or thread-like vine, which in turn develops the 
spore-producing part of the plant. Hymenomycetes is divided into the 
following six Families: 

a. HYMENIUM FIGURATE. 

I. Spread over the surface of lamellae or gills AGARICACE^E. 

II. Lining the interior of tubes or pores POLYPORACE^E. 

III. Clothing the surface of spines or protuberances of various forms HYDNACE^E. 

b. HYMENIUM EVEN. 

IV. Horizontal and mostly on the under surface THELEPHORACE^:. 

V. Vertical and produced all over the surface CLAVARIACE^. 

VI. Superior, gelatinous fungi .TREMELLACE^E. 

FAMILY I. AGARIC ACE^J. 

In the Agaricaceae the hymenium is spread over lamellse or gills 
which radiate from a center or stem. The gills are composed of a 
double membrane, and are simple or branched. 

The parts of an Agaric may all be present as in Amanitae, or severally 
absent in other genera. When the young fungus is entirely enclosed in 
a wrapper or case, this case is called the universal veil. When this 
veil is ruptured by the growth of the stem, that part which remains 

i 



Agaricaceae 

attached to the base is called the volva. The membrane reaching from 
the stem to the margin of the cap is the partial veil ; when it ruptures 
by the expansion of the cap and all or a portion adheres to and about 
the stem it forms the annulus or ring. In some species one or both 
veils may be present, or one or both may be absent. 

The stem is central when supporting the cap at its center ; excentric 
when at one side of the center; lateral when it supports the cap from 
the side. If the stem is absent, the cap is said to be sessile; if the cap 
is horizontal and supported by a broad base it is dimidiate; if attached 
to its place of growth by its back it is rcsnpinate. 

Genera are largely distinguished by the manner in which the gills are 
attached to the stem. These distinguishing attachments are shown in 
the plates illustrating genera and in Plate IV. Gill-shapes. 

For convenience Agaricaceae is divided by the color of the spores into 
five series: white, pink, brown, purple, black. The last two, owing 
to the similarity of hue, are by some writers (preferably) included in 
the black-spored series. Spore color is a valuable assistant in deter- 
mining species. 

Series I. LEUCOSPOR-ffi. Or. white; Gr. seed. 

Spores white, rarely dingy or inclining to reddish. In the genus 
Russula the spores of some species are white, in some cream-color, and 
in several pale ochraceous. Variations from pure white are found in 
the spores of Tricholoma personatum and a few other species. Gill- 
color is not a guide \ to spore-color. Purple, yellow, brown, pinkish 
gills may produce white spores. 



AMANITA.

Mount Amanus.) 

Amanita. Universal veil (volva), which is at first continuous (completely en- 
veloping the young plant), distinct from the skin of the cap. Hymen-

and easily separable from the stem, which leaves a socket in the flesh 
when it is removed. All growing upon the ground. Fries.

Spores white. 

On the ground. 

The nearest allied genus, Aman- 
itopsis, is separated by the absence 
of a ring, and Lepiota by its lack 
of a volva; Volvaria, Acetabula- 
ria and Chitonia, possessing volvas, 
are distinguished by the color of 
their spores. 

Amanitae are the most beautiful and conspicuous of fungi. While 
there are comparatively few species of them, the individual members 
are plentiful in appearing from spring until the coming of frost. They 
are solitary or gregarious in growth. Occasionally two or three are 
found together. They frequent woods, groves, copse, margins of woods 
and land recently cleared of trees. They are seldom found in open 
fields. A careful study of all their botanic points should be the first 
duty of the student of fungi. Familiarity with every characteristic of 
the Amanitae will insure against fatal toadstool poisoning, for it is the 
well-grounded belief of those who have made thorough investigation 
that, with the exception of Helvella esculenta, now Gyromitra escu- 
lenta, the Amanitae, alone, contain deadly poisons. 

No Amanita, or piece of one, should be eaten before its identity is fully 
established and its qualities ascertained by referring to the descriptions 
Jierein given or to the opinion of an expert. 

They are the aristocrats of fungi. Their noble bearing, their beauty, 
their power for good or evil, and above all their perfect structure, have 
placed them first in their realm ; and they proudly bear the three badges

Agaricaeeae 

Amanita. of their clan and rank the volva or sheath from which they spring, the 
kid-like apron encircling their waists, and patch-marks of their high 
birth upon their caps. In their youth, when in or just appearing above 
the ground, they are completely invested with a membrane or universal 
veil, which is distinct and free from the skin of the cap. As the plant 
grows the membrane stretches and finally bursts. It sometimes ruptures 
in one place only and remains about the base of the stem as the volva. 
When such a rupture occurs the caps are smooth. In most species por- 
tions of the volva remain upon the cap as scruff or warts pointed or 
rough or as feathery adornment ; any or all of which may in part or 
whole vanish with age or be washed away by rain. 

Extending from the stem to the margin of the cap, and covering the 
gills, is the partial veil a membranaceous, white texture of varying 
thickness. As the cap expands this veil tears from it. Portions fre- 
quently remain pendant from the edges, the rest contracts to the stem 
as a ring, or droops from it as a surrounding ruffle, or, if of slight con- 
sistency, may be fugacious and disappear, but marks, remains, or the 
veil itself will always be traceable upon the stem. 

The Amanitae are of all colors, from the brilliant orange of the A. 
Caesarea, the rich scarlet or crimson of the A. muscaria, to the pure 
white of the A. phalloides in its white form. 

Their stems are usually long, and taper from the base toward the top. 
In some forms the base is distinctly bulbous. The volva at the base is 
attached to the stem at its lower extremity. It may be visible as a 
cup or ruptured pouch with spreading mouth, or it may be of such 
friable texture as to appear like mealy scales. Often, when the plant 
is pulled from the ground, the volva remains, but the marks of its 
attachment will appear and should be carefully looked for. Their gills 
are commonly white, are of equal length and radiate from near the 
stem, which they do not reach, to the circumference of the cap. They 
are white, unless tinged with age, excepting upon A. Caesarea and A. 
Frostiana where they are yellow.* Their caps are umbrella-shaped, flat 
or convex. Their flesh is white, does not change color when bruised. 
They are scentless and almost tasteless when fresh, when old they have 
a slightly offensive odor and taste. 

The family is not a large one, not over thirty members complete its 
circle. Every feature, every part of its several members, should be 
thoroughly known before the intimacy of eating. While at least nine 
* A. Frostiana is not always yellow gilled.

of the family are not only edible but delicate and sapid, far better will Amanita, 
it be to leave all alone than to make a mistake. A piece of a poison- 
ous variety the size of a dime will often cause serious disorders if eaten. 
Many persons have died from eating very small quantities. 

Because of its ovate or button-like form when young, it is frequently 
mistaken for the common field mushroom; even experienced mycoph- 
agists have been deceived by it. No other poison has so puzzled 
scientists. Other varieties of fungi may interfere with digestion, but to 
the Amanitae all deaths from toadstool-eating are traceable. Its subtle 
alkaloid is absorbed by the system, and in most cases lies unsuspected 
for from six to twelve hours, then its iron grip holds to the death. For 
centuries it has defied all remedies. The problem has been partially 
solved. At Shenandoah, Pa., August 31, 1885, a family of five were 
poisoned by toadstools ; two died, three lived. Noting the sad account 
in the newspapers, I at once wrote to Shenandoah for specimens of the 
fungi eaten and a description of the treatment. I promptly received 
from Dr. J. E. Schadle (now Professor Schadle), the physician in 
charge of the cases, a box containing two harmless varieties and sev- 
eral fine specimens of the Amanita phalloides, all of which were gath- 
ered on the same spot and by the same person who gathered the toad- 
stools doing the poisoning. They told the tale. A remarkably full 
and interesting account of the cases was sent to me by Dr. Schadle. 
After exhausting all other remedies, and after two of the five had died, 
he administered subcutaneously, by hypodermic injection, sulphate of 
atropine a product of the deadly nightshade analagous to belladonna 
rir to ^h * a grain at a dose. It proved to be an antidote and 
saved the lives of the remaining three. 

The action of atropine in arresting the deadly work of poisoning by 
amanitine had been foreshadowed by Schmidberg and Koppe, and 
dwelt upon in numerous published articles by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, to 
whom more than any other is due the branding of the murderous mem- 
bers of the Amanita family ; but for the first time atropine was used 
upon the human system to ward their blows. 

All of the species herein described are found in the United States. 
Of the twenty-seven, nine are edible, nine are either known to be deadly 
or are so closely allied to deadly species that it is unsafe to class them 
as other than poisonous until absolute proof is obtained of their harm-

ANALYSIS OF SPECIES. 

* Volva opening at the top or splitting all around, leaving a mani- 
fest, free border at the base of the stem. Pileus naked or with broad 
membranace'ous patches. 

** Volva splitting regularly all round the lower portion, persistent, 
more or less closely embracing the base of the bulbous stem. The 
upper portion being adnate to the pileus appears on it by expansion as 
scattered, thick warts. 

*** Volva friable, entirely broken up into wart-like scales, there- 
tore not persistent at the base of the stem, which is at first globose-bulb- 
ous, becoming less so as it lengthens. Pileus bearing mealy patches, 
soon disappearing or with small, hard, pointed warts. 

**** Volva rudimentary, flocculose, wholly disappearing. 

* Volva bursting at top, etc. 
A. viro'sa Fr. virus, poison. 

MINING white. Pileus 3-4 in. broad, fleshy, at 
first conical and acute, afterwards bell-shaped, 
then expanded, naked, viscous in wet weather, 
shining when dry, margin always even, but most 
frequently unequal, turned backward and inflexed. 
Flesh white, unchangeable. Stem 4-6 in. long, 

-wholly stuffed, almost solid, split up into longitudinal fibrils, cylindrical 
from the bulbous base, often compressed at the apex, torn into scales 
on the surface, springing from a lax, wide, thick volva, which bursts 
open at the apex. Ring close to the top, lax, silky, splitting up into 
floccose fragments. Gills free, thin, narrow, narrowing at both ends, 
but a little broader in front, not decurrent on the stem (although the 
apex of the stem is often striate), crowded, somewhat floccose at the 
edge. Fries. 

The pilei are most frequently oblique, extended and lobed on one 
side as in Hygrophorous conicus, scarcely ever depressed. The pileus 
rarely becomes yellow. The fragments of the veil often adhere to the 
edge of the gills.

This species is common and variable. It occurs everywhere in woods 
and assumes such different colors that the inexperienced mycologist is 
apt to mistake its different forms for distinct species. With us the pre- 

7 



Agaricaceae 

Amanita. vailing colors of the pileus are white, yellowish- white, grayish-brown 
and blackish-brown. It is remarkable that the form with a greenish 
pileus, which seems to be common enough in Europe, does not occur 
here. Fries also mentions a form having a white pileus with a black 
disk. A somewhat similar form occurs here, in which the pileus is 
grayish-brown with a black disk. Some of the variously colored forms 
were formerly taken to be distinct species, in consequence of which 
several synonyms have arisen, of which A. virescens Fl. Dan., Amanita 
viridis Pers., and Amanita citrina Pers., are examples. A. verna 
Bull, is a variety having a white pileus, a rather thick annulus and an 
appressed volva. It sometimes occurs early in the season; hence the 
specific name. It also occurs late in the season and runs into the typical 
form so that it is not easy to keep it distinct. The flesh and the lam- 
ellae are white, the stem is white, pallid or brownish, and the annulus is 
either white or brownish. The bulb is generally very broad and abrupt 
or depressed, though it sometimes is small and approaches an ovate 
form. The large bulbs are sometimes split externally in two or three 
places and are, therefore, two- or three-lobed. In such cases the volva 
is less persistent than usual and its free portion then furnishes merely an 
acute edge or narrow margin to the bulb. Specimens sometimes occur 
in which the margin of the pileus is narrowly adorned with a slight 
woolly hairiness, but usually it is perfectly smooth and even. By this 
character, taken in connection with the membranous volva and bulbous 
base of the stem, the species is readily distinguished. Sometimes a 
strong odor is emitted by it, but usually the odor is slight. Authors 
generally pronounce this a poisonous and very dangerous species. Its 
appearance is attractive, but its use as food is to be avoided. Peck, 
33d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Common in woods and recently cleared woodlands. Frequent over 
the United States. June to frost. 

An exceedingly poisonous, dangerous, seductive species, responsible 
for most of the deaths from toadstool eating ; because in its white form 
it is mistaken for the common mushroom Agaricus campester. The 
real fault is with the collector, who should never eat any fungus found 
in the woods, believing it to be the mushroom. The mushroom does 
not grow in the woods. Neither has it white gills, nor white spores, nor 
a volva at the base of the stem as have Amanitae. 

The caps of A. phalloides vary in color white, oyster-color, smoky 



Leucosporae 

brown. The color of the commonest form is from white to a light hue Amanita. 
of greenish yellow. The center of the cap, whatever may be the pre- 
vailing color, is usually several shades darker. In shape, the cap 
changes from a knob in youth, through the shapes of expansion, until 
it becomes fully spread, when it is umbrella-shaped, or almost flat. 
Some forms have a slightly raised portion or umbo in the center of the 
cap. The gills are white, of good width, rounded next to the stem and 
free from it. 

The stem conforms in color to the cap, but in lighter shades. White- 
capped varieties have white stems. The stem has a sudden broad, dis- 
tinct bulb at the base. On the upper side of the bulb there is usually a 
margin or rim. The stem tapers more or less toward the cap, from 
which it is easily separable. The cup, wrapper or volva is torn or split 
or irregular at the upper part, and is not pressed to the stem as in some 
forms. 

Professor Peck, in his 48th Report, gives the following excellent synop- 
sis of differences between the poisonous Amanita and edible fungi, for 
which it could only by great stupidity be mistaken : 

Poison amanita. Gills persistently white. Stem equal to or longer 
than the diameter of the cap, with a broad, distinct bulb at the base. 

Common musliroom. Gills pink, becoming blackish-brown. Stem 
shorter than the diameter of the cap, with no bulb at the base. 

From all forms of the edible Sheathed amanitopsis the Poison ama- 
nita differs in its distinctly bulbous stem, in having a collar on the stem 
and in the absence of striations on the margin of the cap. 

From the edible Reddish amanita, it is easily separated by the entire 
absence of any reddish hues or stains and of warts upon its cap. 

From the Smooth lepiota its distinct, abrupt and marginal bulb at 
once distinguishes it. 

A. ver'na Bull. vernus, of spring. A variety of A. phalloides. 
POISONOUS. White. Pileus ovate then expanded, somewhat de- 
pressed, viscid, margin orbicular, even. Stem stuffed then hollow, 
equal, floccose, closely sheathed with the free border of the volva. Ring 
reflexed, swollen. Gills free. Pileus glabrous, even on the margin, 
white, viscid when moist. Gills white. Stem ringed, white, floccose, 
stuffed or hollow, closely sheathed at the base by the remains of the 
membranous volva, bulbous. Spores globose, 8/* broad .

Agaricaceee 

Amanita. In woods. Spring and summer. 

The Vernal Amanita scarcely differs from white forms of the A. 
phalloides except in the more persistent and more closely sheathing 
remains of the wrapper at the base of the stem. It is probably only a 
variety of that species, as most mycologists now regard it, and it should 
be considered quite as dangerous. I have not found it earlier than in 
July, although in Europe it is said to appear in spring, as its name im- 
plies. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Common over the United States. West Virginia, New Jersey, Penn- 
sylvania, May to November. It appeared at Mt. Gretna, Pa., on May 
28, 1899. Mcllvaine. 

The absence of a ring separates white forms of A. volvata and A. 
vaginata. 

The virulence of its poison is the same as that of A. phalloides. 

A. magnivela'ris Pk. magnus, large; velum, veil. Pileus con- 
vex or nearly plane, glabrous, slightly viscid when moist, even on the 
margin, white or yellowish-white. Gills close, free, white. Stem long, 
nearly equal, glabrous, white, furnished with a large membranous white 
annulus, sheathed at the base by the appressed remains of the mem- 
branous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and radicating. 
Spores broadly elliptical, 10x6-8;*. 

Pileus 3-5 in. broad. Stem 5-7 in. long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Solitary in woods. Port Jefferson, Suffolk county. July. 

The species resembles Amanita verna, from which it is separated by 
its large persistent annulus, the elongated downwardly tapering bulb of 
its stem, and especially by its elliptical spores. Peck, 5oth Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

I have not seen this species. Its resemblance to A. verna is enough 
to place the ban upon it until it has been tested. 

A. map'pa Fr. mappa, a napkin. From the volva. Pileus 2-3 in. 
broad, commonly white or becoming yellow, slightly fleshy, convexo- 
plane, obtuse or depressed, orbicular, dry, margin for the most part 
even. Stem 2-3 in. long, 3-5 lines thick, stuffed then hollow, almost 
equal above the bulb, rather smooth, white. Ring superior, soft, lax, 
here and there torn. Volva regularly circularly split, somewhat ob- 
literated ; the globoso-bulbous base united with the stem, with an acute

This is a dangerous species, because containing a deadly poison and 
resembling the most common forms of Amanitopsis, therefore likely to 
be mistaken for them. Specimens sent by me to Professor Peck were 
identified as his species. I add my own description. 

Pileus oval, broadly umbonate, date-brown toward and on umbo, 
soft, dry, smooth, more or less sulcate on edge. Flesh white, thin, 
except at center. Stem tapers rapidly above ring and at base, white- 
reddish-brown toward middle, narrows toward volva from which it is 
almost free at the base, hollow, furfuraceous above ring. Gills white, 
crowded, free. Ring white, thin, persistent, but at times hard to dis- 
tinguish because clinging to stem. Volva free, fitting close, upper

it is not. White forms occur. 

Not as virulent as A. phalloides, but like it in its POISONOUS ef-

Open woods, under pines on lawns. July to October. 

Reported from North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Mary- 
land, New Jersey, Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York. 
Peck, Rep. 23, 32, 33, 48. 

This emperor of fungi is the most showy of its race. It grows to 10 
in. in height. The cap reaches 8 in. in diameter and the stem over i % 
in. in thickness. In very much smaller specimens about the same pro- 
portions occur. The cap is at first ovate, then hemispherical, then ex- 
panded. It has no warts or scales upon it. The margin is distinctly 
striate. The flesh is white, yellow or reddish under the skin; next to 
the gills it is usually yellow. 

The stem tapers upward from the socket at its base. It is yellowish 
and covered with loose fibrils of darker hue. The ring is white, but 

12 



Iieucosporse 

frequently tinged with yellow. In taste and smell it is mild. Open Amanita. 
woods is its favorite habitat, yet it is found growing luxuriantly under 
pines, maples, elms, on lawns. It is not often found, but when it is, it 
is solitary, or in groups or rings. In the latitude of Philadelphia it is 
found from July until October ist. Further south its stay conforms to 
temperature, and it is more frequent. There is no doubt of its rare 
edibility abroad, and of its being eaten in America. 

A specimen believed to be it should never be eaten until carefully 
distinguished from A. muscaria and A. Frostiana, which have warts or 
scales on the cap (which sometimes are not discernible after rain), 
white gills, and a volva which soon breaks up into fragments or scabs. 

Appearing like a small form of A. muscaria, to which it was formerly 
referred, is A. Frostiana Pk. (Frost's Agaric). It closely resembles 
small A. Caesarea, especially in the yellow tinge of stem, ring and gills. 
The volva and ring (persistent in A. Caesarea) soon disappear, but are 
traceable by fluffy fragments, or yellow stains. It is extremely poison- 
ous. 

The differences, concisely, are these : A. Caesarea (Orange Amanita). 
Cap smooth, though occasionally with a few fragments of the volva as 
patches upon it. Gills yellow. Stem yellow. Volva usually persistent, 
sometimes breaking up into soft, fluffy masses. 

A. muscaria (Fly Amanita). Poisonous. Cap covered with remains 
of the volva as scales or wart-like patches. Gills white. Stem white or 
light-yellow. Volva not persistent, breaking up into fluffy fragments 
or scales. 

A. Frostiana. Poisonous. Smaller and more delicate than the two 
preceding. Cap smooth or with yellow scales or wart-like patches. 
Gills yellow or tinged on edge with yellow. Stem white or yellow, 
the ring evanescent, but always leaving a yellow mark on stem. Volva 
yellow, breaking up into yellow fluffy fragments. 

Far better for the amateur to let the A. Caesarea, and anything re- 
sembling it, respectfully alone.

Amanita. The writer has not had opportunity to eat A. Caesarea. If such 
should occur he would go about it very cautiously. No suspicion 
attaches to it abroad, but evidence is accumulating in the hands of the 
writer (not yet convincing) that either locality may render it poisonous 
or that A. muscaria varies so much in appearance as to deceive even 
the expert into mistaking it for A. Caesarea. It is possible that A. 
muscaria is, at times, in certain localities, harmless; but no such ex- 
ception as this is noted in the entire fungoid realm. It is not so common 
that collectors should mourn its waste. It is better, far, to let it alone. 

**Volva splitting regularly all around; pileus bearing thick warts, etc. 

A. musca'l'ia Linn. nnisca, a fly. (Plate VI, fig. 4, p. 6. Plate

first thick, and in wet weather glutinous, but which gradually disappears, 
and sprinkled with thick, angular, separating fragments of the volva ; 
margin when full-grown slightly striate. Flesh not compact, white, 
yellow under the pellicle. Stem as much as a span long, shining white, 
firm, torn into scales, at first stuffed with lax, spider-web fibrils, soon 
hollow\ the adnate base of the volva forms an ovate bulb, which is mar- 
ginate with concentric scales. Ring very soft, torn, even, inserted at

Var. atba Pk. It also occurs on Long Island in two forms, the 
normal one and a smaller one, in which the warts of the pileus are 
evanescent or wanting. Not unfrequently it makes a close approach to 
white forms of A. pantherina, in having the upper part of the bulb uni- 
formly margined by the remains of the definitely circumscissile volva, 
but this margin is more acute than in that species. Peck, 46th Rep.

"At Cincinnati, yellow A. muscaria are all we find." Lloyd. 

Reported from most of the states. At Mt. Gretna I found it in great 
quantity, and frequently three or four tightly crowded together. Many 
pounds of it were sent to Professor Chittenden, Sheffield Laboratory, 
Yale University. Near Haddonfield, N. J., large patches annually 
grow under pines, gorgeous in their rich orange-red caps, usually scaly, 
with at times lemon-yellow in the same clusters, smooth as A. Caesarea. 
It grows from July until after hard frosts. 

It is undoubtedly poisonous to a high degree. Its juices in minute 
quantity, carefully and scientifically injected into the circulation of ether- 
ized cats, kill in less than a minute. A raw piece of the cap, the size 
of a hazel nut, affects me sensibly if taken on an empty stomach. Diz- 
ziness, nausea, exaggeration of vision and pallor result from it. The 
pulse quickens and is full, and a dreaded pressure affects the breathing. 
I have not noticed change in the pupil of the eye. Nicotine from 
smoking a pipe with me abates the symptoms, which entirely dis- 
appear in two hours, leaving as reminiscence a torturing, dull, skull- 
pervading headache. If, as is asserted on good authority, the Siberians 
use it as an intoxicant, they certainly suffer the accustomed penalty.

Agaricaceae 

Amanita. It is possible that persons may, in a degree, become immune to its poi- 
son, as they do to arsenic, strychnia, opium, nicotine, or it may be that 
a portion of the poison is extracted by boiling. It is, however, ex- 
tremely dangerous to rely upon extracting by any means the poison of 
the Amanita, and to eat the residue. Acetic acid or vinegar does not 
destroy the poison ; it dissolves it to an extent and extracts it, and be- 
comes as poisonous as the plant itself. There is no means of telling 
how much of the poison remains in the plant after such treatment. The 
safe plan is to eat, only, of toadstools which do not contain any poison 
to extract. 

One redeeming virtue, alone, rests with A. muscaria it kills flies. 

A. Frost'iana Pk. in honor of Charles C. Frost. POISONOUS. 
(Plate VI, fig. 5, p. 6.) Pileus convex or expanded, bright-orange or 
yellow, warty, sometimes nearly or quite smooth, striate on the margin. 
Gills free, white or slightly tinged with yellow. Stem white or yellow, 
stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes evanescent ring, bulbous at the base, 
the bulb slightly margined by the volva. Spores globose, 8-io/x. in 
diameter. 

Plant 2-3 in. high. Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem about 2 lines 
thick. June to October. 

This appears like a very small form of the Fly Agaric, to which, as 
var. minor, it was formerly referred. The only decided characters for 
distinguishing it are its small size and globose spores. Our plant some- 
times grows in company with A. muscaria, but it seems to prefer more 
dense woods, especially mixed or hemlock woods. It is generally very 
regular and beautiful and has the stem quite often of a yellow color, and 
the bulb margined above with a collar-like ring. Peck, 33d Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Mcllvaine. 

A. Frostiana is found well over the land. It is frequent in shady 
woods and seems to favor ground under the prevailing tree oak, chest- 
nut, pine, hemlock, whichever it may be. From the many hundreds 
I have seen, I think it more likely to be mistaken by the novice for A. 
Caesarea than A. muscaria, because of its often yellow gills and stem. 
It is much smaller and thinner than either. In the states I have found 
it, it is darker than described, being a rich reddish-orange or scarlet. 
The partial veil or ring is very evanescent but often found upon the 

16 



Leucosporae 

stem as a yellow, floccose remnant. The stain of the ring is always Amanita. 
noticeable. The volva is seldom found entire. It, too, is evanescent, 
but, like the veil, is found yellow and fluffy, adhering to the fingers 
when touched. 

It is probable that its highly colored cap has caused it to be gathered 
by the careless collector of bright-capped Russulae, and that thus R. 
emetica got its bad name. Examine carefully any toadstool resembling 
it. The Russulae have neither ring nor volva. 

A. excel'sa Fr. excelsus, tall. POISONOUS. Pileus 4-5 in. broad, 
brownish-gray, darker in the center, fleshy, soft, globose, then plane, 
pellicle thin, but viscous, and in reality separable in wet weather, then 
the surface is often wrinkled-papillose, or in a peculiar manner hollowed 
and pitted, sprinkled with angular, unequal, whitish-gray, easily sep- 
arating warts, the remains of the friable volva; margin at first even, 
but when properly /developed manifestly striate, even furrowed. Flesh 
soft, white throughout, unchangeable. Stem 4-6 in. long, I in. thick, 
at first stuffed, almost solid, but at length hollow, globose-depressed at 
the base, attenuated upward from the bulb, covered, sometimes as far 
as the ring, sometimes only on the lower part \vlthdense, squarrose, con- 
centric scales (from the epidermis of the stem being torn), striate at the 
apex. Ring superior, large, separating-free or at length torn. Gills 
quite free, rounded (not decurrent on the stem in the form of lines), 
very ventricose, K in. and more broad, shining white. 

The bulb when young is somewhat marginate, but by no means sep- 
arable, the margin proper, like that of A. muscaria, is marked with 
scales, buried in the soil, somewhat rooting, beneath the margin marked 
here and there with a concentric furrow. The shorter gills intermixed 
are more numerous than is usual among Amanitae. There is a smaller 
variety, with the margin more frequently striate and the stem stuffed, 
then hollow. Fries.

or somewhat depressed, with a sticky pellicle, which is at first thick and 
olivaceous dingy-brown, then thinned out, almost disappearing and 
Jivid, the disk only becoming brownish; margin evidently striate; the 
fragments of the volva divided into small, equal, white, regularly 
arranged, moderately persistent warts. Flesh wholly 'white, never 
yellow beneath the pellicle. Stem 3-4 in. long, >2 in. thick, at first 
stuffed then hollow with spider-web fibrils within, equal or attenuated

base by the separable volva which has an entire and obtuse margin. 
Ring more or less distant, adhering obliquely, white, rarely superior. 
Gills free, reaching the stem, broader in front, 3-4 lines broad, shining

It is readily distinguished from A. muscaria, var. umbrina, by the

Qualities not stated. 

Massachusetts, Francis. 

A. Strobilil'or'mis Vitt. strobilis, a pine-cone, from the shape of 
the warts. (Plate IX, fig. 3, p. 18.) Cap 3-10 in. across, convex 
or nearly plane, white or cinereous, sometimes yellow on the disk, 
rough with angular, mostly persistent warts which sometimes fall away 
and leave the pileus nearly smooth ; generally whitish, sometimes tinged 
with brown ; the margin even and extending a little beyond the lamellae. 
Gills free, rounded behind. Veil large and portions sometimes adhere 
to margin of cap. Stem 3-8 in. long, up to 1*4 in. thick, equal or 
slightly tapering upward, solid, floccose-scaly, white, bulbous, the bulb 
very large, sometimes weighing a pound, margined above and furnished 
with one or two concentric furrows, somewhat pointed below, firmly 
and deeply imbedded in the earth, floccose-mealy when young.

Edible. W. G. Smith, Curtis, Peck. 

This is among the best of species. Its size, solidity, flavor are 
marked. I have found specimens weighing a pound and a half. It 
grows singly, but when one is found several are apt to be neighbors. 
When young, the cap is but a small knob upon a beet or top-shaped 
base, which is largely under ground. It cuts like a soft turnip, and has 
a strong, pungent, unmistakable odor, like chloride of lime, which en- 
tirely disappears in cooking. As the plant develops the bulb decreases 
in size. On all the many specimens the author has seen and eaten, the 
scabs are light brown and reddish-brown. 

A. SOlita'ria Bull. growing alone. Pileus convex or plane, warty, 
white or whitish, even on the margin. Gills reaching the stem, white 
or slightly tinged with cream color. Stem at first mealy or scaly, equal, 
solid, white, bulbous, the bulb scaly or mealy, narrowed below into a 
root-like prolongation. Ring lacerated, often adhering in fragments to 
the margin of the pileus and gills. Spores elliptical-oblong, 8-13x6.5^.

Solitary in woods and open places. July to October. 

Georgia, H. N. Starnes; Indiana, H ' . I . Miller; West Virginia, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mcllvaine. 

Edible. Curtis, H. N. Statues, Philadelphia Myc. Club. 

In many localities I find it quite plentiful, and it is so reported from 
Georgia. Southern and middle New Jersey woods abound with it, and 
at Mt. Gretna, Pa., it is always present in its growing months. 

The cap is sometimes tinged with brown as are the angular, erect 
warts which are generally numerous, but often falling off or few and 
scattered. The flesh is white and smells like chloride of lime, but not 
nearly so strong as A. strobiliformis. The volva is broken up into 
floccose scales which cling to bulb and lower part of stem. These scales 
may be white and mealy or brownish. The entire fungus has a fluffy 
exterior, which is easily removed by rubbing. The annulus is torn, a 
part often adhering to the margin of the pileus and the gills. This and 
the long, tapering, rooting bulb are marked characteristics. The bulb 
is brittle. It is difficult to get the fungus from the ground entire. 

Stem and cap are juicy, tender, mild in flavor, wholesome. It is not 
equal in flavor to A. rubescens, but is more delicate. 

By many its properties have been stated as poisonous, doubtful. 
Quantities of it have been eaten by myself and friends. Hypodermic 
injection of its juices into the blood circulation of live animals prove it 
perfectly harmless. 

A. can'dida Pk. shining white. PileilS thin, broadly convex or 
nearly plane, verrucose with numerous small, erect, angular or pyramidal, 
easily separable warts, often becoming smooth with age, white, even on 
the margin. Flesh white. Gills rather narrow, close, reaching to the 
stem, white. Stem solid, bulbous, floccose-squamose, white, the annulus 
attached to the top of the stem, becoming pendent and often disappear- 
ing with age, floccose-squamose on the lower surface, striate on the 
upper, the bulb rather large, ovate, squamose, not margined, tapering 
above into the stem and rounded or merely abruptly pointed below. 
Spores elliptical, 10-13x8^. 

Pileus 3-6 in. broad. Stem 2.5-5 m - long, 5-8 lines thick, the 
bulb 1-1.5 m - thick in the dried specimens.

lieucosporae 

This is a fine large species related to A. solitaria, but differing from Amanita. 
it in the character of its bulb and of its annulus. The bulb is not mar- 
ginate nor imbricately squamose. Its scales are small and numerous. 
Nor is it clearly radicating, though sometimes it has a slight abrupt 
point or myceloid-agglomerated mass of soil at its base. The veil or 
annulus is large and well developed, but it is apt to fall away and dis- 
appear with age. Its attachment at the very top of the stem brings it 
closely in contact with the lamellae of the young plant and the striations 
of its upper surface appear to be due to the pressure of the edges of 
these upon it. It separates readily from the margin of the pileus and is 
not lacerated. In the mature plant the warts have generally disap- 
peared from the pileus and sometimes its margin is curved upward

*** Whole volva friable, etc. 

A. rubes'cens Pers. rubesco, to become red. (Plate IX, fig. 2, 
p. 18. Plate XII, fig. 4, p. 32.) Pileus about 4 in. broad, dingy- 
reddish, becoming pale flesh-color, tan, scarcely pure, fleshy, convex, 
then plane, obtuse, moist but not glutinous in rainy weather and opaque 
when dry, covered with unequal, soft, mealy, whitish, easily-separating 
warts, which are smaller, harder and more closely adherent in dry 
weather ; margin even and, when old, slightly striate only in wet weather. 
Flesh commonly soft, white when fresh, reddening when broken. Stem 
4-5 in. long, as much as I in. thick, stuffed, somewhat solid, though 
soft within, conico-attenuated from the thickened base, reddish-scaled, 
becoming red-white, and without a trace of a distinct volva at the base. 
Ring; superior, large, membranaceous, soft, striate and white within. 
Gills reaching the stem in an attenuated manner, forming decurrent lines 
upon it, thin, crowded, soft, as much as % in. broad, shining white. 

Very changeable, but readily distinguished from all others of the 
same group by the flesh being reddish when broken; the stem and pileus 
are commonly spotted-red when wounded. In dry weather it is firmer, 
flesh reddening more slowly, warts minute. Odor scarcely any. There

It is quite common, often growing in large patches. Recent authors 
agree upon the edibility and deliciousness of this species. The author 
knows it to be one of the most plentiful, useful and delicious, after sev- 
eral years of pleasant experience with it. 

In July, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, I found, growing from the ground gre- 
gariously, a singular fungoid growth from 2-5 in. high; cap hemis- 
pherical, i in. in diameter, tightly fitting a solid stem of nearly the 
diameter of the cap. The whole was watery white, and evidently af- 
fected by a parasite. It was edible. September ist Professor Peck 
wrote to me : "I think I have found the identity of the diseased 
Agaric, of which you sent me samples some time ago. I mean the one 
affected by Hypomyces incequalis Pk. The host is Amanita rubescens, 
at least sometimes, and probably always." 

The plant is very heavy for its size. The lack of a volva, the dingy 
color and reddish stains .distinctly separate this from any poisonous 
Amanita. 

A. spis'sa Fr. compact, dense; of the warts. Pileus umber, sooty

A. spissa has been reported from but few localities. It is rare in the Amanita. 
latitude of Philadelphia. Half a dozen specimens have been found in 
neighboring New Jersey. 

Taste and smell strong, but when cooked the dish is savory and not 
unlike one of A. rubescens. 

A. as'pera Fr. asper, rough. Pileus 2-3 in. across. Flesh rather 
thick at the disk, whitish, white or reddish with tints of livid or gray, 
reddish or brownish under the cuticle; convex then plane, margin thin 
and even, rough with firmly adnate, minute, closely crowded, angular 
warts, reddish-brown or livid-brownish, not pure white, unchangeable. 
Gills free and rounded behind, not striately decurrent, ventricose, white. 
Stem stuffed, striate above the ring, short at first, ovate, then elon- 
gating to 2-3 in., attenuated upward from a wrinkled bulb, squamulose, 
white without and within. Ring superior, entire. 

Spores 8x6/u. Massee; 8x67/4 W.G.S. 

The flesh of stem and bulb when eaten by insects is reddish, the bulb 
when old is a reddish-brown. The large ring and stem become red 
when touched. In these particulars it resembles A. rubescens. In smell 
it is somewhat strong, not unlike A. strobiliformis, but not nearly so 
pungent. 

Cooked it is of excellent quality and flavor. I have eaten it since 1885 . 

A. abrup'ta Pk. abrupt, of the bulb. Pileus thin, broadly convex 
or nearly plane, covered with small angular or pyramidal, erect, some- 
what evanescent warts, white, slightly striate on the margin. Flesh 
white. Gills moderately close, reaching the stem and sometimes ter- 
minating in slightly decurrent lines upon it, white. Stem slender, gla- 
brous, solid, bulbous, white, the bulb abrupt, subglobose, often coated 
below by the white persistent mycelium, the ring membranous, per- 
sistent. Spores broadly elliptical or subglobose, 8-iox6-8/x. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 2.5-4 m - l n g, 3~4 lines thick. 

The chief distinguishing mark of this species is the abrupt, nearly 
globose, bulbous base of the stem. This is somewhat flattened above 

o 

and is sometimes longitudinally split on the sides. The small warts of 
the pileus are easily separable, and in mature specimens they have often 
wholly or partly disappeared. The remains of the volva are not pres- 
ent on the bulb in mature dried specimens, which indicates that the 

23 



Agaricaceae

spissa, etc. The latter species have the bulb of the stem similar to that 
of our plant, but the color of the pileus and other characters easily sep- 
arate it. Peck, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

Alabama, U. and E.; West Virginia, Nuttall; New Jersey, Ellis; 
Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, in a cluster of a dozen individuals, and after- 
ward until frost, strong smelling, warts brownish-white, Mcllvaine. 
It is edible and equal to A. strobiliformis. 

A. calyptra'ta Pk. Pileus fleshy, thick, convex or nearly plane, 
centrally covered by a large irregular persistent grayish-white fragment 
of the volva, glabrous elsewhere, striate on the margin, greenish-yellow 
or yellowish-brown tinged with green, the margin often a little paler or 
more yellow than the rest. Lamellae close, nearly free, but reaching 
the stem and forming slight decurrent lines or striations on it, yellowish- 
white tinged with green. Stem stout, rather long, equal or slightly 
tapering upward, surrounded at the base by the remains of the ruptured 
volva, white or yellowish white with a faint greenish tint. Spores 
broadly elliptic, IO/A long, 6/u- broad, usually containing a single large 
nucleus. 

Pileus 10-20 cm. broad. Stem 10-15 cm. long, 12-20 mm. thick. 

Rich ground in fir woods or their borders. Autumn. Oregon. Dr, 
H . Lane. 

This is a large and interesting species, well marked and easily recog- 
nized by its large size, by the greenish tint that pervades the pileus, 
lamellae, annulus and stem, and especially by the large persistent patch 
of grayish-white felty material that covers the center of the pileus and 
sometimes extends nearly to the margin. This is in fact the upper part 
of the ruptured volva that is carried up by the growing plant, and is 
very suggestive of the specific name. In the young state the plant is 
entirely enveloped in the volva, which then is similar to a goose egg in 
size and shape, and its walls are one-fourth to one-half inch thick. So 
thick and firm are they that the young plant appears sometimes to be 
unable to break through and it decays in its infancy. 

Dr. Lane says that, having found that the Italians made use of this 
mushroom for food, he began eating it and introducing it to his friends, 
and he learned by personal trial that it is a thoroughly good and whole- 
some mushroom, which, when broiled with bacon, fried, baked or 
stewed, may be eaten with perfect safety and that it is a nutritious food.

Leucosporee 

A. Creimla'ta Pk. PileuS thin, broadly ovate, becoming convex Amanita. 
or nearly plane and somewhat striate on the margin, adorned with a few 
thin whitish floccose warts or with whitish flocculent patches, whitish or 
grayish, sometimes tinged with yellow. Lamellsp close, reaching the 
stem, and sometimes forming decurrent lines upon it, floccose crenulate 
on the edge, the short ones truncate at the inner extremity, white. 
Stem equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow, white, 
the annulus slight, evanescent. Spores broadly elliptic or subglobose, 
7.5-101". long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single large nucleus. 

PileuS 2.5-5 cm - broad. Stem 2.5-5 cm - l n g> 6-8 mm. thick. 

Low ground, under trees. Eastern Massachusetts. September. Mrs. 
E. Blackford and George E. Morris. 

The volva in this species must be very slight, as its remains quickly 
disappear from the bulb of the stem. The remains carried up by the 
pileus form slight warts or thin whitish areolate patches. The annulus 
is present in very young plants, but is often wanting in mature ones, in 
which state the plant might be mistaken for a species of Amanitopsis. 
Its true affinity is with the tribe to which A. rubescens belongs. As in 
that species, the bulb soon becomes naked and exhibits no remains of 
the volva. It is similar to A. farinosa also in this respect, but quite 
unlike it in color, in the adornments of the pileus and in the character 
of its margin, which is even in the young plant and but slightly striate 
in the mature state. Its dimensions are said sometimes to exceed those 
here given, and it is reported to have been eaten without harm and to 
be of an excellent flavor. I have had no opportunity to try. Peck, 
Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 27, January, 1900. 




Agaricaceae 

AMANITOFSIS Roze. 

Amanita; op sis, resembling. 

Amanitopsis. AFLFH AVING a universal veil at first completely envel- 

oping the young plant, which soon bursts through, 
carrying particles of it on the pileus, where they 
appear as scattered warts readily brushed off; the 
remainder or volva closely enwraps the base of the 
stem. Ring absent. Spores white. This genus 

r ^^B-^>Jwrj= _--. 

^ ** was formerly included in Amanita. It differs from 
Amanita in the absence of a ring or collar upon the stem and in the 
more sheathing volva. It differs from Lepiota in having a volva. 

Close observation is necessary in collecting Amanitopsis for the table. 
It has no trace of ring or veil upon the stem . So far as the species are 
known no poisonous one exists. But Amanita spreta Pk., which is 
deadly, so closely resembles forms of Amanitopsis that those confident 
of their knowledge will be deceived. The veil or traces of veil, which 
Amanita spreta always has, sometimes so adheres to and wraps the stem 
that it is not noticeable without close examination, thus giving to it 
every appearance of an Amanitopsis. 

The volva of A. spreta is attached for a considerable distance to the 
base of the tapering stem, and is not readily removed. This is a guide 
to detect it. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. 

Amanitopsis corresponds to Volvaria in the pink-spored series, in 
which, as far as known, there is no poisonous species. 

All American species of Amanitopsis are given. Several have not 
been tested by the writer because of lack of opportunity. 

A. vagina'ta Roze vagina, a sheath. (Plate X, figs. I, 2, p. 28.) 
PileilS thin, fragile, glossy, smooth except in rare instances where a 
few fragments of the volva adhere to it for a time, deeply and distinctly 
striate on the margin, sometimes umbonate. Flesh white, in the dark 
forms grayish under the skin. Stem ringless, sometimes smooth, but 
generally mealy or floccose, hollow or stuffed with a cottony pith, not 
bulbous. Volva long, thin, fragile, closely sheathing yet free from the 
stem, except in the lower part, easily detachable and frequently remain- 
ing in the ground when the plant is pulled. Color variable, generally 
mouse-gray, sometimes livid, tawny-yellow or white, in one variety a

Var. futva Schaeff. yellowish. Tawny-yellow or pale ochraceous. 

This plant is widely dispersed, having been reported from many local- 
ities in the United States, also from Nova Scotia and Greenland. 

On ground in woods and on margins of woods, under trees, in shaded 
grassy places. Sometimes in open stubble and pastures. June to frost. 
Mt. Gretna, September, 1899, found a cluster on decayed chestnut 
stump. Various colors abound hazel, brown, gray, yellow, whitish. 
The caps and stems are tender as asparagus tips, but without much dis- 
tinct flavor when cooked. 

Great care must be taken to distinguish these forms from Amanita 
spreta Pk. which is poisonous. See heading of genus Amanitopsis. 

A. niva'lis Grev. snowy. (Plate X, fig. 3, p. 28.) Pileus at first 
ovate, then convex or plane, smooth, striate on the thin margin, white, 
sometimes tinged with yellow or ochraceous on the disk. Flesh white. 
Gills subdistant, white, free. Stem equal, rather tall, nearly smooth, 
bulbous, stuffed, white; the volva very fragile, soon breaking tip into 
fragments or sometimes persisting in the form of a collar-like ring at the 
upper part of the bulb. Spores globose, 7.5-10^ in diameter. 

Plant 4-6 in. high. PileilS 2-3 in. broad. Stem 2-4 lines thick. 
July to October. 

It approaches in some respects A. Frostiana, but its larger size, 
smooth pileus, lighter color and the absence of an annulus will easily 
distinguish it from that species. Peck, 33d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Specimens have been repeatedly found by the writer in open oak 
woods near Philadelphia. 

A strong, unpleasant bitter, which appears to develop while cooking, 
renders it unpalatable. It is harmless, but its use is not advised. 

A. velo'sa Pk. velosus, fleecy. Pileus at first subglobose, then bell- 
shaped or nearly plane, generally bearing patches of the remains of the 
whitish felty or tomentose volva, elsewhere glabrous, becoming sulcate-

Under oak trees. Pasadena, California. April. A. J. McClatchie. 

This fungus is closely related to A. vaginata, from which it may be 
separated by the more adherent remains of the thicker volva which 
sometimes cover the whole surface of the pileus, and by the thicker gills 
which are somewhat adnate to the stem and terminate with a decurrent 
tooth. Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 22, No. 12. 

As it is probable this species will be found elsewhere than California, 
and from its close relation to A. vaginata likely to be edible, its descrip- 
tion is here given. 

A. Strangllla'ta (Fr.) Roze choked, from the stuffed stem. (Plate 
X, fig. 4, p. 28.) Pileus at first ovate or subelliptical, then bell-shaped, 
convex or plane, warty, slightly viscid when moist, deeply and distinctly 
striate on the margin, grayish-brown. Gills free, close, white. Stem 
equal or tapering upward, stuffed or hollow, nearly smooth, white or 
whitish, the volva soon breaking up into scales or subannular fragments, 
Spores globose, io-i3)u,.

Peck, 33d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

A. Cecilia B. and Br. is a synonym. 

Not distinct in color and general appearance from A. vaginata, but 
distinctly separated by its warty pileus and evanescent mouse-colored 
volva which does not sheath the stem. Pileus striate when young, then 
sulcate. Stem mealy, especially on the upper part. 

Woods, open grassy places, wheat stubble, etc. June to September. 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Mcllvaine. 

In the latitude of Philadelphia the plant is found in great abundance. 
Its rather early appearance, staying quality, delicate consistency and 
flavor make it valuable as a food supply. 

Pearl color, bluish-gray and gray are the prevailing cap-coloring.

Volva adnate, white, downy, margin free and lax, sometimes almost 
obsolete. Gills truly adnate, crowded, with many intermediate shorter 
ones, white. Spores subglobose, with an oblique point, 7-8/ut Massee. 
Tender, good flavor, yielding more substance when cooked than any 
other Amanitopsis. 

A. volva'ta Pk. possessing a volva. Pileus convex, then nearly 
plane, slightly striate on the margin, hairy or floccose-scaly, white or 
whitish, the disk sometimes brownish. Gills close, free, white. Stem 
equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed, minutely floccose-scaly, 
whitish, inserted at the base in a large, firm, cup-shaped, persistent 
volva. Spores elliptical, lOxSyu,. 

Plant 2-3 in. high. Pileus 2-3 broad. Stem 3-4 lines thick. 
Peck, 33d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

The plant is easily recognized by its large, cup-shaped volva and cap, 
which is not smooth, as is usual in a species with a persistent mem- 
branous volva, more or less scaly with minute tufts of fibrils or tomen- 
tose hairs. The gills are white in the fresh plant. 

Professor Peck notes the species as quite rare. Numerous specimens 
occur in the sandy oak woods of New Jersey, and in oak woods near 
Angora, Philadelphia. July to October. 

Care must be taken to determine the absence of an annulus or any 
trace of one. Tender, delicate, without pronounced flavor. Equal to 
Amanitopsis vaginata. 

A. farino'sa Schw. covered with farina, meal. PileilS nearly plane, 
thin, flocculent-pulverulent, widely and deeply striate on the margin ,

LEPIO'TA Fr.~ 

Lepis, a scale. 

PileilS generally scaly from the breaking up of the cuticle and the Lepiota. 
adherence of the concrete veil. Grills free, often very distant from the 
stem and attached to a cartilagi- X^i^ (Plate XI.) 

nous collar. Stem hollow or stuffed, 
its flesh distinct from that of the 
pileus. Ring at first attached to 
the cuticle of the pileus, often mov- 
able, sometimes evanescent. 

On the ground . Several are found 
in hot-houses and hot-beds, and are 
probably introduced species. 

The universal veil, covering the 
entire plant when very young, is 
closely applied to the pileus, which 
from the breaking up of the cuticle 
is generally scaly. The stem in 
most species differs in substance 
from the pileus. This is readily 
seen by splitting the plant in half 
from cap to base. It is easily sep- 
arated from the cap, leaving a cup- 
like depression therein. Grills usu- 
ally white. In some species they are yellow-tinted. In others they 
become a dingy red when wounded or ageing. 

The veil in this genus, being concrete with the cuticle of the pileus, 
never appears as loose warts or patches, neither is there a volva as in 
Amanita and Amanitopsis. These three genera are the only ones in 
the white-spored series having gills free from the stem. In a few species 
the gills are slightly attached to the stem, but are never decurrent upon 
it as in Armillaria. When the plant is young it is egg-shaped. It then 
gradually spreads, becomes convex, and opens until it is nearly flat, 
with a knob in the center. 

The only species in this genus known to be poisonous to some persons 
is L. Morgani Pk., which is distinguished by its green spores and white

the ring. The remainder of the veil united with the pileus breaking up 
and becoming downy or scaly. Collar at the apex of stem not so large 
as in Proceri, hence the gills are not usually so remote. Taste and 
smell unpleasant, resembling that of radishes.

Readily known by its extremely tall stem, shaggy cap, distinct umbo 
and the channel between the gills and stem. Resembles no poisonous 
species. 

Before cooking the scurf should be rubbed from the caps, which alone 
should be eaten, as the stem is tough. Though the flesh is thin, the 
gills are meaty and have a pleasant, nutty flavor. Fried in butter it 
has few equals. It makes a superior catsup.

of any in this section, and consequently not much value as food. 

L. gracilen'ta Krombh. gracilis, slender. Pileus rather fleshy, 
thickest at the disk, ovate then bell-shaped, finally flattened, obscurely 
umbonate; at first brownish from the adnate cuticle, which, breaking 
up into broad adpressed scales, allows the whitish pileus to be seen be- 
neath them. Gills remote, very broad, crowded, pallid. Stem whit-

Peck in Bot. Gaz., March, 1879. 

Open dry grassy places. Dayton, Ohio. A. P. Morgan. 

This species is remarkable because of the peculiar color of the spores. 
No green-spored Agaric, so far as I am aware, has before been dis- 
covered, and no one of the five series, in which the very numerous species 
of the genus have been arranged, is characterized in such a way as to 
receive this species. 

It seems a little hasty to found a series (Viridispori) on the strength 
of a single species. Until other species of such a supposed series shall 
be discovered it seems best to regard this as an aberrant member of the 
white-spored series. The same course has been taken with those Agarics 
which have sordid or yellowish or lilac-tinted spores. 

It gives me great pleasure to dedicate this fine species to its discoverer 
Mr. Morgan. Peck. 

Commonly 6-8 in. high, 5-9 in. diameter, though larger specimens 
are sometimes found. It is the most conspicuous Agaric in the meadows 
and pastures of the Miami valley; it appears to flourish from spring to 
autumn whenever there is abundance of rain. 

It is heavier and stouter than L. procera and I am disposed to claim 
that it is the largest Agaric in the world. Spores 10-12x7-8)".. In 
immature specimens they are greenish-yellow. Morgan.

very abundant in the western and southwestern states. Mr. H. I. 
Miller, Terre Haute, Ind., writes August 18, 1898: "I have recently 
measured several which were more than twelve inches across. At the 
present time this mushroom is growing in more abundance throughout 
Indiana than any other. It grows luxuriantly in the pastures, generally

Leucosporse 

in grand fairy rings, five, ten, fifteen feet in diameter. We find it also Lepiotn, 
in the woods. It is beautifully white and majestic, and these rings can 
be seen in meadows where the grass has been eaten close, for half a 
mile or more. The gills are white until the cap is almost opened, by 
which time the green spores begin to cause the gills to change to green. 
The meat is fine and is usually more free from worms than other mush- 
rooms. Six families, here, have eaten heartily of them. The experi- 
ence is that one or two members of each family are made sick, though 
in two families, who have several times eaten them, no one was made 
sick. I enjoy them immensely, and never feel any the worse for eating 
them. I doubt if we have a finer-flavored fungus. The meat is simply 
delicious. One fairy ring yields a bushel." 

Prof. W. S. Carter, University of Texas, Galveston, reported to me 
(and sent specimens of L. Morganii) the poisoning of three laboring 
men from eating this fungus. They were seriously sick, but recovered. 

The conclusion is inevitable that this green-spored Lepiota contains a 
poison which violently attacks some persons, yet is harmless upon others. 

I have not had opportunity to test it. It should be tested with great 
caution. (See Supplement, pages 730 and 738.) 

CLYPEOLA'RII. Clypeus, a shield. Ring fixed; stem sheathed, etc.

Agaricaceae 

Lepiota. sis, because the American plant which I have referred to it does not in 
all respects agree with this description, but comes so near it that it can 
scarcely be specifically distinct. In the American plant, so far as I 
have seen it, erect, acute scales are always present, especially on the 
disk, and the down of the pileus does not always break up into distinct 
areas or scales. Neither is the stem usually scaly, but rather clothed 
with soft tomentose or almost silky fibrils. The gills are crowded and 
some of them are forked. At the furcations there are slight depressions 
which interrupt the general level of the edges, and give them the ap- 
pearance of having been eaten by insects. The plant has a slight odor, 
especially when cut or bruised. Peck, 35th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Remarks under L. acute*squamosa apply to L. Friesii, which Fries 
himself doubts being distinct from the first. The plants vary greatly in 
size, color and habitat. The name acutesquamosa carries a descrip- 
tive meaning with it that L. Friesii does not. 

It does not appear to have been reported except by Professor Peck, 
but probably appears as L. acutesquamosa in other lists. 

The edible qualities are excellent. 

L. acutesquamo'sa Wein. acutus, sharp; squama, a scale. Pileus 
fleshy, obtuse, at first hairy-floccose, then bristly with erect, acute, 
rough scales. Stem somewhat stuffed, stout, bulbous, powdered above 
the moderate-sized ring. Gills approximate, lanceolate, simple. Fries. 

PileilS convex or nearly plane, obtuse or broadly subumbonate, 
clothed with a soft tawny or brownish-tawny tomentum, which usually 
breaks up into imperfect areas or squamae, rough with erect, acute scales, 
which are generally larger and more numerous on the disk. Gills close, 
free, white or yellowish. Stem equal, hollow or stuffed with webby fila- 
ments, subbulbous. Spores about 7x34/4. 

Woods and conservatories. Buffalo, G. W. Clinton; Albany, A. F. 
Chat field; Adirondack mountains and Brewertown, Peck. 

The form found in the hot-houses seems to have the tomentum of the 
pileus less dense and the erect scales more numerous than in the form 
growing in woods. The annulus is frequently lacerated. In the speci- 
mens of the woods the erect scales are sometimes blackish in color, and 
they then contrast quite conspicuously with the tawny or brownish- 
tawny tomentum beneath them. They vary in size and shape. Some 
resemble pointed papillae, others, being more elongated, are almost

and more numerous on the disk than elsewhere, and often they are 
wholly wanting on the margin. Peck, 35th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

West Philadelphia, 1897, on lawn and growing from trunk of a maple 
tree; Mt. Gretna, Pa., mixed woods. Mcllvaine. 

I first saw specimens of L. acutesquamosa when sent to me by Miss 
Lydia M. Patchen, President Westfield Toadstool Club. It was later 
found by myself and tested. Specimens were sent to Professor Peck 
and identified as L. acutesquamosa. 

Caps and stems brownish-purple. The pointed squamules or tufts 
have dark-brown points, shaded to a delicate purple at base. Gills 
light, faint flesh-color. Veil is silky, transparent, beautiful, quite tena- 
cious stretching until cap is well expanded, persistent, though at times 
fugacious. Smell like stewed mushrooms. The caps are of excellent 
substance and flavor. 

L. his'pida Lasch. rough. Pileus 2-3 in. across. Flesh thin, 
white, unchangeable; hemispherical then expanded, umbonate, tomen- 
tose or downy at first from the remains of the universal veil ; during 
expansion the down becomes broken up into small, spreading, scaly 
points, which eventually disappear, umber-brown, sometimes with a 
tawny tinge. Gills free but near to the stem, the collar of the pileus 
prominent and sheathing the stem, crowded, ventricose, simple, white. 
Stem about 3-5 in. long, 3-5 lines thick, attenuated upward, densely 
squamosely-woolly up to the superior, membranaceous, reflexed ring, 
dingy-brown, stem tubular, but fibrillosely stuffed. Spores 6 7x4/u. 
Massee. 

In margins of and in open mixed woods, under pine trees, Haddon- 
field, N. J., July to September, 1892. Quite plentiful year after year in 
the same places. The American plant is taller than the English species, 
the stem reaching five inches, and the color of the cap a delicate tawny- 
brown. Smell slight, but pungent like radishes. 

The whole fungus is tender and delicious. It is one of the few Lepi- 
otae that stews well. 

L. feli'na Pers. belonging to a cat. Pileus thin, bell-shaped or 
convex, subumbonate, adorned with numerous subtomentose or floccose 
blackish-brown scales. Gills close, free, white. Stem slender, rather

Woods. Adirondack Mountains. August and September. 

It is easily distinguished from A. rubrotincta by the darker color of 
the scales of the pileus, by the loose floccose filaments that clothe the 
brown stem, by the fugacious ring and the smaller spores. Peck, 35th 
Rep. N. Y. State Dot. 

The caps compare favorably with other Lepiotae in substance and 
flavor. 

L. crista'ta A. and S. crista, a tuft, crest. Pileus thin, bell-shaped 
or convex, then nearly plane, obtuse, at first with an even reddish or 
reddish-brown surface, then white adorned with reddish or reddish- 
brown scales formed by the breaking up of the cuticle, the central part 
or disk colored like the scales. Gills close, free, white. Stem slender, 
hollow, equal, smooth or silky-fibrillose below the ring, whitish. Rin^ 
small, white. Spores oblong or narrowly subelliptical, 5-7x3-4/1. 

Plant 1-2 in. high. Pileus .5-1.5 in. broad. Stem 1-2 lines thick. 

Grassy places and borders of woods. June to September. 

This species is easily known by its small size and the crested appear- 
ance of the white pileus, an appearance produced by the orbicular un- 
ruptured portion of the cuticle that remains like a colored spot on the 
disk. The fragments or scales are more close near this central part and 
more distant from each other toward the margin, where they are often 
wholly wanting. The scales are sometimes very small and almost gran- 
ular. In very wet weather the margin of the pileus in this and some 
other species becomes upturned or reflexed. Peck, 35th Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

Found in Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. June to September, 
1897. Mcllvaine. 

Scales were appressed and slightly tinged with brown, often very 
small. Caps of same, upturned and bare near margin. Taste sweet, 
slightly like new meal. Odor strong. 

Cooked it is of good consistency and pleasing to taste.

L. alluvi'naPk. alluvies, the over-flowing of a river. Pileus thin, Lepiota. 
convex or plane, reflexed on the margin, white, adorned with minute 
pale-yellow hairy or fibrillose scales. Grills thin, close, free, white or 
yellowish. Stem slender, fibrillose, whitish or pallid, slightly thickened 
at the base. Ring slight, subpersistent, often near the middle of the 
stem. Spores elliptical, 6-7x4-5^. 

Plant 1-2 in. high. Pileus .5-1 in. broad. Stem 1-1.5 l mes thick. 

Alluvial soil, among weeds. Albany. July. 

In the fresh plant the scales are of a pale yellow or lemon color, but 
in drying they and the whole pileus take a deeper rich yellow hue. The 
ring is generally remote from the pileus, sometimes even below the 
middle of the stem. Peck, 35th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

In 1897, I found it growing among weeds on lot near University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Seemingly it is a city resident. 

The taste and smell are pleasant. Cooked it is tender and savory. 
Both stems and caps are good. 

L. metulse'spora B. and Br. metula, an obelisk. Pileus thin, bell- 
shaped or convex, subumbonate, at first with a uniform pallid or brown- 
ish surface, which soon breaks up into small brownish scales, the margin 
more or less striate, often appendiculate with fragments of the veil. 
Gills close, free, white. Stem slender, equal or slightly tapering up- 
ward, hollow, adorned with soft floccose scales or filaments, pallid. 
Ring slight, evanescent. Spores long, subfusiform. 

Plant 2-3.5 in. high. Pileus .5-1 -5 in- broad. Stem 1-2 lines 
thick. 

Woods. Adirondack mountains. August and September. 

This species occurs with us in the same localities as L. felina, which 
it very much resembles in size, shape and general characters, differing 
only in color, the striate margin of the pileus and the character of the 
spores. 

The species has a wide range, having been found in Ceylon, England, 
Alabama and Kentucky. Peck, 35th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

This has not been elsewhere noted in the United States, probably 
from neglect of the spore characters, being reported as L. clypeolaria.

L. naucina Fr. is the European species which has its American coun- 
terpart in L. naucinoides Pk. The variations in the American species 
are noted under L. naucinoides. 

As Amanita phalloides in its white form the poisonous white Ama- 
nita, resembles L. naucina or L. naucinoides in some stages of its growth 
and may be confounded with it, careful note should be taken of their ex- 
ternal differences. In L. naucinoides the bulb and stem are continuous, 
each passing into the other imperceptibly; in A. phalloides the junc- 
tion of stem and bulb is abrupt and remains so, and the bulb is more 
or less enwrapped in the volva. The ring is also larger than in L. nau- 
cinoides and is pendulous, and the gills are permanently white. A cer- 
tain means of distinguishing between them is by the application of heat 
as in cooking. On toasting both it will be found that the gills of the 
Amanita remain white, but those of the Lepiota turn quickly brown. 

L. naucinoi'des Pk. No translation applicable. (Plates XV, XII, 
fig. 2, p. 32.) Pileus soft, smooth, white or snowy-white. Gills free, 
white, slowly changing with age to a dirty pinkish-brown or smoky- 
brown color. Stem ringed, slightly thickened at the base, colored like 
the pileus. Spores subelliptical, uninucleate, white, 8-10 long xS-8/* 
broad. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

L. naucinoides Pk. is the American counterpart of L. naucina Fr., 
a European species, excepting that the spores of the latter are described 
as globose. The caps are ovate when young and usually from I / 3 in. 
across when expanded, but occasionally reach 4 in., smooth, but 
frequently rough or minutely cracked in the center, white or varying 
shades of white deepening in color at the summit. In a rare form var. 
squamo'sa, large, thick scales occur which are caused by the breaking

Agaricaceae 

Lepiota. up of the cap surface. When young the gills are white or faintly yellow, 
becoming pinkish or dull brown in age. The pinkish hue is not always 
apparent. The outer edge of the veil or ring is thickest; usually it is 
firmly attached to the stem, but movable rings are frequently noticed. 
When the plant ages the ring is often missing, but traces of it are always 
discernible. Stem rarely equal, often it is distinctly bulbous, generally 
tapering upward from a more or less enlarged base, hollow when fully 
grown, until then containing cottony fibers within the cavity or appearing 
solid, 2-3 in. long, %% in. thick. 

Its habitat is similar to that of the common mushroom lawns, 
pastures, grassy places though unlike the latter it is found in woods. 
Until thoroughly acquainted with it, specimens found in woods and 
supposed to be L. naucinoides should not be eaten. An Amanita might 
be mistaken for it. It is readily distinguishable from the common 
mushroom and its allies by the color of the gills and spores which are 
white, and differences in stem and veil. 

It is found from July until after hard frosts. It was first reported 
edible by Professor Peck in 1875, under the name of Agaricus naucinus. 

The L. naucinoides is rewarding the favor with which it has been 
received as an esculent, it being equal to the common mushroom and 
quite free from insects. Large crops of it are reported from all over the 
country, and from many sections it is told of as a stranger. During 
1897-98 the author has found it in plenty upon ground familiar to him 
for years, upon which it had not previously shown itself. The common 
mushroom must look to its laurels. 

Its cultivation as a marketable crop is possible and probable. 

L. cepsesti'pes Sow. cepa, an onion; stipes, stem. (Plate XII, fig. 
3, p. 32.) Pileus thin, at first ovate, then bell-shaped or expanded, 
umbonate, soon adorned with numerous minute brownish scales, which 
are often granular or mealy, folded into lines on the margin, white or 
yellow, the umbo darker. Grills thin, close, free, white, becoming 
dingy with age or in drying. Stem rather long, tapering toward 
the apex, generally enlarged in the middle or near the base, hollow. 
Ring thin, subpersistent. Spores subelliptical, with a single nucleus, 
8-10x5-8/4. 

Plant often cespitose, 2-4 in. high. Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem

Whoever has seen the seed-stalks of an onion knows the shape from 
which this fungus takes its name. The dense clusters are graceful, 
dainty, and contain many individuals of all ages from the very young 
with egg-shaped heads, like pigmy C. comatus, to the fluff-capped eld- 
est, willowy and fair to look upon. The out-door kind soon droops 
when matured ; the young plants of a cluster will remain fresh for 
several days after taken from their habitat. Stems in these tufts are 
often quill-shaped, and the striations on the cap margins are shorter 
than those on their indoor cousins. These grow in hot-houses and sta- 
bles. One of the two forms has a yellow cap, the other is white and 
fair. 

These forms have often come to my table as a pleasant winter sur- 
prise. Children in the hot-houses of Haddonfield, N. J., watched for 
its appearance among the bedded plants, sure of a present when they 
brought me a meal of it. Both the white and yellow varieties were 
equally enjoyed. 

The entire fungus is tender and delicious cooked in any way. 

L. farino'sa Pk. farina, meal. Pileus thin, rather tough, flexi- 
ble, at first globose or ovate, then bell-shaped or convex, covered with 
a soft, dense, white veil of mealy down, which soon ruptures, forming 
irregular, easily-detersible scales, more persistent and sometimes brown- 
ish on the disk. Flesh white, unchangeable. Gills close, free, white, 
minutely downy on the edge. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward > 
somewhat thickened at the base, slightly mealy, often becoming gla- 
brous, hollow or with a cottony pith above, solid at the base, white, 
pallid or straw-colored, the ring lacerated, somewhat appendiculate on 
the margin of the pileus, evanescent. Spores subovate, 10-13x81*.

Ohio, Lloyd, Prof. William Miller (Lloyd Myc. Notes). 

L. Americana Pk. (Plate XII, fig. i, p. 32. Plate XVa.) Pileus 
at first ovate, then convex or expanded, urnbonate, scaly, white, the 
umbo and scales reddish or reddish-brown. Gills close, free, white. 
Stem somewhat thickened at or a little above the base, hollow, bearing 
a ring, white. Spores subelliptical, uninucleate, 8-iox5-8/u,. 

The American lepiota belongs to the same genus as the parasol 
mushroom and the Smooth lepiota. It has one character in which it 
differs from all other species of Lepiota. The whole plant when fresh 
is white, except the umbo and the scales of the cap, but in drying it 
assumes a dull reddish or smoky-red color. By this character it is 
easily recognized. 

In the very young plant the cap is somewhat egg-shaped and nearly 
covered by the thin reddish-brown cuticle, but as the plant enlarges the 
cuticle separates and forms the scales that adorn the cap. On the 
central prominence or umbo, however, it usually remains entire. The 
margin of the cap is thin and is generally marked with short radiating 
lines or striations. The gills do not quite reach the stem and are, there- 
fore, free from it. Sometimes they are connected with each other at or 
near their inner extremity by transverse branches. They are a little 
broader near the margin of the cap than at their inner extremity. The 
stem affords a peculiar feature. It is often enlarged towards the base 
and then abruptly narrowed below the enlargement, as in the Onion- 
stemmed lepiota. In some instances, however, the enlargement is not 
contracted below and then the stem gradually tapers from the base up- 
ward. The stem is hollow and usually furnished with a collar, but some- 
times this is thin and may disappear with advancing age. Wounds or 
bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues. 

The caps vary in width from 1-4 in. ; the stems are from 3-5 in. 
long, and 2-5 lines thick. Sometimes plants attain even larger 
dimensions than these. The plants grow singly or in tufts in grassy 
ground or on old stumps. They may be found from July to October. 

In flavor this species is not much inferior to the parasol mushroom, 
but when cooked in milk or cream it imparts its own reddish color to

Redman's Woods, Haddonfield, N. J. September, 1894. Mcllvaine. 

This species is included in Amanita by Fries and Stevenson. Massee 
places it in Lepiota. In the dozen or more specimens I have found, 
there was no trace of a volva, even when very young. I tested it care- 
fully and at one time ate three good-sized caps without experiencing 
any indications of poison. I have seen it during but one season and 
not then (at one time) in sufficient quantity to make a meal off it. 
Cooked it has a slight oheesy flavor which is pleasant. 

L. illi'nita Fr. illino, to smear over. PileilS rather thin, soft, at 
first ovate, then campanulate or expanded, subumbonate, smooth, white, 
very viscid or glutinous, even or striate on the margin. Gills close, 
free, white. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed or hollow, 
viscid, white. Spores broadly elliptical, 5x4/1, broad. 

Plant 2-4 in. high. Pileus 1-2.5 in. broad. Stem 2-3 lines thick. 

Thin or open woods. Adirondack mountains. July to September. 

This is a smooth white species with the stem and pileus clothed with 
a clear viscid or glutinous veil. The margin of the pileus is often even, 
but the typical form of the species has it striate. The flesh is soft and

ARMILLA'RIA Fr. 

Armilla,3i ring. 

Armuiaria. Pileus and Stem continuous. Veil partial, sometimes only indicated 

(Plate XVII.) by the scales which clothe the stem 

terminating in the form of a ring. 
Spores white. On the ground or on 
stumps. 

In the young plant the veil extends 
from the stem to the pileus, some- 
times forming scaly patches upon it ; 
below the ring it is attached to the 
stem often in scales. 

But for the presence of the ring 
the species of this genus could be dis- 

tributed in Tricholoma, Clitocybe and Collybia, with which they agree 
in all other characters. 

In Amanita and Lepiota, the other ringed genera of the white-spored 
series, the flesh of the stem and pileus is not continuous; and their stems 
are therefore easily separated. Amanita is also distinguished by its

The substance of A. robusta differs from all other Armillaria in being 
very compact. It is not acrid but has a marked flavor. Cut into small 
pieces and well cooked it makes an acceptable dish. It is best in 
croquettes and patties, or served with meats. 

A. viscid'ipes Pk. viscidus, sticky; pes, a foot. PileilS fleshy, com- 
pact, convex or nearly plane, glabrous, whitish with a slight yellowish 
or reddish-yellow tint. Flesh white, odor peculiar, penetrating, sub- 
alkaline. Gills narrow, crowded, sinuate or subdecurrent, whitish. 
Stem equal, solid, viscid and slightly tinged with yellow below the 
narrow membranous ring, whitish above. Spores elliptical, 8x5/4. 

Pileus 3-6 in. broad. Stem 3-4 in. long, 6-12 lines thick. 

In mixed woods. Rock City, Dutchess county. October. 

It is a large fine fungus, easily known by its white and yellowish hues, 
its crowded gills, viscid stem and peculiar penetrating almost alkaline 
odor. The cuticle of the pileus is thin and soft to the touch, but it 
sometimes cracks longitudinally and is sometimes slightly adorned with 
innate fibrils. A. dehiscens is said to have a viscid stem, but it is also 
squamose and the pileus is yellowish-ochraceous. Peck, 44th Rep 
N. Y. State Bot. 

Quite common in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Mcllvaine. 

It loses its strong odor when cooked and is equal to other Armillaria 
in edibility. Unless well cooked it has a slight saponaceous flavor. 
This is easily overcome by a few drops of lejnon juice or sherry.

The general appearance of this species is suggestive of Tricholoma 
album, but the presence of a veil separates it from that fungus and places 
it in the genus Armillaria. The veil, however, is often slightly lacer- 
ated or webby and adherent to the margin of the pileus. Peck, Bull.

Young specimens are quite as edible as A. mellea, and rather more 
juicy. 

' II. CLITOCYB^E. Gills not sinuate, etc. 

A. mel'lea Vahl. melleus, of the color of honey. (Plate XVI, fig. i, 
p. 52.) PileilS adorned with minute tufts of brown or blackish hairs, 
sometimes glabrous, even or when old slightly striate on the margin. 
Gills adnate or slightly decurrent, white or whitish, becoming sordid 
with age and sometimes variegated with reddish-brown spots. Stem 
ringed, at length brownish toward the base. Spores elliptical, white, 
8-io/n long. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Spores 9x5-6;* W.G.S.; iox8/* B.; 8-io/u, Peck. 

The A. mellea is unusually prolific and is common over the United 
States and Europe. Specimens may be found in the spring-time, but 
in middle latitudes it is common from August until after light frosts. It 
is usually in tufts, some of which contain scores of plants and are showy 
over ground filled with roots, or on stumps or boles of decaying trees. 
It frequents dense woods and open clearings. I have seen acres of dense 
woodland at Mt. Gretna, Pa., so covered with it and its varieties that 
but few square yards were unoccupied. 

A description of the typical A. mellea will rarely apply to any one 
plant. A combination of its variable features in one description would 
include something of nearly every white-spored Agaric under the sun. 
Yet there is something indescribable about it which once learned will 
unerringly betray it. 

Its Caps vary from perfectly smooth, through tufts of scales and hairs, 
more or less dense, to matted woolliness. It may show any one of these 
conditions in youth and be bald in age. Some shade of yellow is the 
prevailing color, but this will vary from whitish to dark-purplish or 
reddish-brown. When water-soaked it is one color, when dry, another. 
Commonly the margins of the Caps are striated, sometimes they are 
smooth as a cymbal, and not unlike one, have a raised place or umbo 
in the center. Flesh white or whitish. Gills when young are white or 
creamy, usually running down the stem, sometimes slightly notched at 
attachment. They freckle in age and lose their fair complexion. The 
Veil or collar about the stem is as variable as fashion thick and closely 
woven or flimsy as gossamer, or vanishing as the plant grows old. The 

55 



Agaricaceae 

Armiiiaria. Stems may be even as a lead pencil, or swollen like a pen-holder, or 
bulbous toward the base, or distorted by pressure in the tufts. It is as 
variable in color as the cap, usually darkening downward in hues of 
brown. The outside is firm and fibrous, sometimes furrowed, inside 
soft or hollow. 

Cap 1-6 in. across. Stem 1-6 in. long, %-% in. thick. 

Var. obscu'ra has the cap covered with numerous small blackish scales. 

Var. flava has the cap yellow or reddish-yellow, but in other respects 
it is like the type. 

Var. glabra has the cap smooth, otherwise like the type. 

Var. radica'ta has a tapering, root-like prolongation of the stem, 
which penetrates the earth deeply. 

Var. bulbd ' sa has a distinctly bulbous base to the stem, and in this 
respect is the reverse of var. radicata. 

Professor Peck writes: "Var. exannulata (Plate XVI, fig. 2, p. 52) 
has the cap smooth and even on the margin, and the stem tapering at 
the base. The annulus is very slight and evanescent or wholly wanting. 
The cap is usually about an inch broad, or a little more, and the plants 
grow in clusters, which sometimes contain forty or fifty individuals. It 
is more common farther south than it is in our state (N. Y.), and is 
reported to be the most common form in Maryland. This I call var. 
exannulata." From Dr. Taylor, Washington, D. C. ; Indiana, H. I. 
Miller. 

To these may be added also var. al'bida Pk. in which the pileus is 
white or whitish. 

A variety, perhaps a variation of var. bulbosa was sent to me by E. 
B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J., and afterward found by myself at Mt. 
Gretna, Pa. The Cap purplish-brown, convex, striate and light on 
margin, edge irregular with parts of veil attached. Flesh white, very 
thin. Gills decurrent, arcuate, pinkish-gray. Stem stuffed, fibrous, white 
above, dense floccose veil, same color as cap below, swollen toward 
base which is pointed, sulcate, white inside, closely clustered and some of 
the stems distinctly bulbous. Taste decidedly unpleasant. An intense 
acridity develops and increases when the juices of raw pieces are swal- 
lowed, and the salivary glands are much excited. The acridity is not 
lost in cooking. It simply can not be eaten. Specimens were sent by 
me to Professor Peck who referred it to A. mellea. 

I have never seen the abortive form of Clitopilus abortivus, though 

56 



Leucosporee 

found in many places and in great quantity, showing any part or trace ArmUiaria. 
of the original plant. But that a similar monstrosity occurs upon A. 
mellea is shown by individuals and parts of individuals of a cluster being 
aborted. Without such positive proof, no one would suspect either of 
these odd formations to be abortive of either C. abortivus or A. mellea, 
or any other fungus. I consider the abortive form of A. mellea far 
superior in substance and flavor to it or any of its varieties. 

The Armillaria can not be ranked among the tender or high-flavored 
toadstools, yet their abundance, meaty caps and nourishing qualities 
place them among our most valuable food species. 

The caps when chopped into small pieces make good patties and 
croquettes. They have an impressive flavor of their own, and offer an 
esculent medium for seasoning and the gravies of various meats. 

A. nardos'mia Ellis nardosmius, of the odor of nardus. (A name 
applied by the ancients to several plants, especially spica nardi spike- 
nard.) Pileus fleshy, firm, thick and compact on the disk, thin toward 
the margin, whitish, variegated with brown spots, with a thick, tough 
and separable cuticle. Flesh white. Gills crowded, subventricose, 
slightly emarginate, whitish. Stem solid, fibrous, not bulbous, sheathed 
below by the brown velvety veil, the ring narrow, spreading, uneven on 
the edge. Spores subglobose, 6/* in diameter. 

Pileus about 3 in. broad. Stem 1.5-3 m - long, 4-6 lines thick.

ArmUiaria. A., mu'cida Schrad. mucidus, slimy. Pileus commonly shining 
white, thin, almost transparent, hemispherical then expanded, obtuse, 
more or less radiato-wrinkled, smeared over with a thick tenacious glu- 
ten ; margin striate when thinner. Stem 1^3 in. long, 1-2 lines thick 
at the apex, thickened at the base, stuffed, thin, rigid, curved ascend- 
ing, smooth, white, but sooty scaly at the base when most perfectly de- 
veloped. Ring inserted at the apex of the stem, bent downward and 
glued close to the stem, furrowed, the white border again erect, with a 
swollen and entire margin, which sometimes becomes dingy brown. 
Gills rounded behind, obtuse, adhering to the stem and striato-decurrent, 
distant, broad, lax, mucid, always shining white. 

Very variable in stature, from i in. (when of this size the stem is 
almost equal) to as much as 6 in. broad. The color of the pileus varies 
gray, fuliginous, olivaceous. The gills sometimes become yellow, but 
only from disease. Sometimes solitary, sometimes a few are joined in 
a cespitose manner at the base. Stevenson.

Commonly considered esculent in Europe. 

Dirt adheres so tenaciously to it that it is difficult to clean. This, 
however, occurs only when the fungus grows from roots and pushes its 
way up through covering earth. When growing from trees it is attractive 
and of good quality. 

Should be chopped fine and well cooked.

Gr. a hair, a fringe. 

PileilS symmetrical, generally fleshy, never truly umbilicate, seldom Tricholon . 
umbonate. Veil absent or appearing only as fibrils or down on the 

margin of the pileus. Gills sinuate _- ^ (Plate XIX.) 

(the small sudden curve near the 
stem always apparent in the young 
plant), sometimes with a slightly de- 
current tooth. Stem central, usually 
stout, fleshy-fibrous, without a bark- 
like skin. Flesh continuous with 
that of the pileus. Ring and Volva 
absent. Spores white or dingy. 

But one is known to be poisonous. 
Some are acrid or unpleasant in fla- 
vor. With one exception all grow 
on the ground in pastures and woods, 
appearing from May to late in the 
autumn. 

. Gills generally white or dingy, fre- 
quently spotted or stained. The pi- 
leus may be smooth or adorned with 
fibrous or downy scales, dry, moist, 
viscid or water-soaked. 

The distinguishing feature of Tricholoma is the sinuate gills. In 
Collybia the stem bears a distinct bark-like skin ; in Clitocybe the gills 
are never sinuate ; species of Pleurotus are distinguished by growing on 
wood only, and Paxillus by their strongly-incurved margin and anas- 
tomosing gills. 

In cooking Tricholoma consistency must 'be the guide to plan and 
time. The tougher varieties require to be cut into small pieces and to 
be well cooked, while the brittle and delicate varieties will cook quickly. 
Many of them make excellent soups.

Trichoioma. Pine woods, especially in sandy soil. Albany county. September

This is a noble species but not plentiful in our state (N. Y.). The 
pileus is said to become greenish very late in the season. The stem, in 
the typical form, is described as sulphur-yellow in color, but with us it 
is more often white. The scales of the disk are sometimes wanting. 
In our plant the taste is slightly farinaceous at first, but it is soon 
unpleasant. 

Var. pinastreti A. and S. is a slender form having a thin, even pileus, 
thinner and more narrow gills and a more slender stem. A. crassus

Woods. The plants are often cespitose. 

I suspect that Agaricus frumentaceus of Curtis's catalogue belongs to 
this species. Both the pileus and stem, as well as the gills, are apt to 
assume darker hues with age or in drying, and this character suggested 
the specific name. The species is classed as edible. Peck, 44th Rep.

T. transmutans is reported from many states. It has a mealy taste

Agaricacese 

Trichoioma. Mixed woods. Suffolk county, N. Y. September. 

The plants referred to this species are not uncommon on Long Island, 
growing on sandy soil in woods of oak and pine. They are usually 
more or less irregular and the pileus becomes fragile. It is quite vari- 
able in color, sometimes approaching a smoky-brown hue, again being 
nearly white. The taste of the typical form is said to be bitter, but the 
flavor of our plant is scarcely bitter. In other repects, however, it 
agrees well with the description of the species. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y.

Trichoioma. lings upon its cap, gill and stem, in shades of red, subdued though 
they be, give it a handsome personality distinct from any other. 

The species is a variable one in its minor markings. When moisture 
is prevalent the caps of all are viscid. Both young and old are often 
cracked. Stems frequently not squamulose at apex, frequently rosy 
when young, often flattened. The fibrous interior of the stem and its 
fibrous connection with the flesh of the cap are very marked. Gills 
emarginate in youth as well as in age. It is solitary, gregarious, occa- 
sionally bunched. 

An excellent fungus, a free late grower, meaty, easily cooked, and 
of fine flavor. 

T. frumenta'ceum Bull. frumentum, made of corn. Pileus 2-3 in.

Flesh white. Stem 3 in. long, % in. thick, solid, equal, fibrillose 
when dry, whitish. Grills rounded, somewhat crowded, rather broad, 
white, at length spotted-red. 

Wholly becoming pale white, but the stem and pileus are alike marked- 
red, and the gills are at length reddish, wherefore, as well as for the 
strong smell of new meal, it is undoubtedly nearest to A. pessundatus. 
When full grown it has all the appearance of Entoloma. On the

September and October. 

A rare but beautiful species. It is 
often cespitose. It departs from the 
character of the genus in growing on 
decaying wood. Peck, 44th Rep. 
N. Y. State Bot. 

Trichoioma decorosum is not rare in Pennsylvania. I have found it 
at Angora, Philadelphia and in Chester county, Pa., growing in clus- 
ters and singly. At first sight one might take it for one of the many 
forms of Armillaria, but even cursory examination shows the difference. 

It is of good consistency and flavor, having a decided mushroom taste. 

T. flaves'cens Pk. pale yellow. Pileus convex, firm, often irregu- 
lar, dry, slightly silky becoming bare, sometimes cracking into minute 
scales on the disk, whitish or pale yellow. Flesh whitish or yellowish. 
Gills close, white or pale-yellow, emarginate, floccose on the edge. 
Stems firm, solid, often unequal, central or sometimes eccentric, single or 
cespitose, colored like the pilous. Spores subglobose, 5/* in diameter.

Agaricaceae 

Trichoioma. Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 1-2.5 in- long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Pine stumps. Albany and Rensselaer counties. October. 

The species seems to be related to T. rutilans but has not the red or 
purplish tomentum of that fungus. It, like T. decorosum, is always 
lignicolous. T. rutilans is sometimes so. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y. State 
Bot. 

Frequently found in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
Pine stumps. September to frost. Mcllvaine. 

The flesh compares with that of T. rutilans, and makes an equally 
good dish. 

T. gran'de Pk. Pileus thick, firm, hemispherical, becoming con- 
vex, often irregular, dry, scaly, somewhat silky-fibrillose toward the 
margin, white, the margin at first involute. Flesh grayish-white, taste 
farinaceous. Gills close, rounded behind, adnexed, white. Stem stout, 
solid, fibrillose, at first tapering upward, then equal or but slightly 
thickened at the base, pure white. Spores elliptical, 9-1 ix6/*. 

Pileus 4-5 in. broad. Stem 2-4 in. long, 1-1.5 in. thick. 

Among fallen leaves in woods. Cattaraugus county. September. 

The plants are often cespitose, and then the pileus is more or less 
irregular and the gills somewhat lacerated. The species is related to 
T. columbetta, from which its larger size, constantly scaly pileus, more 
cespitose mode of growth, larger spores and farinaceous taste separate 
it. The scales of the pileus are brownish, and the pileus itself is some- 
times slightly dingy on the disk. The young margin is pure white like 
the stem, and both it and the upper part of the stem are sometimes 
studded with drops of moisture. 

The plant was found on trial to be edible, but not of first quality. 
The flesh is not very tender, nor the flavor captivating even in young 
specimens. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

The species is very variable and the following varieties have been de- 
scribed : 

Var. A. Pileus nearly always repand or lobed, at first bare, even, 
at length cracked-scaly, often reddish spotted, the margin when young 
indexed, tomentose. Stem obese, even, unequal, swollen, an inch thick. 
The typical form. 

Birch wood among mosses. 

Var. B. Pileus subflexuous, silky-fibrillose, at length scaly, some- 
times dingy-brown spotted, the margin scarcely tomentose. Stem 
longer, equal or slightly narrowed at the base. 

Bushy places. Intermediate between A and C. 

Var. C. PileilS regular, flattened, evidently fibrillose, sometimes 
spotted with blue, four inches broad. Stem equal, cylindrical, fibrillosc- 
striate, four inches long. 

Beech woods. A showy variety so diverse from variety A that it 
might be regarded as a distinct species, did not variety B connect them, 
and so much resemble both that it might with equal propriety be re- 
ferred to either. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 1-4 in. long, 3-12 lines thick. 

Woods and pastures. Albany county, N. Y. 

It may be distinguished from T. album by its mild taste. It is re- 
corded as edible. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Edible, Curtis, Cooke, Stevenson. 

This much varied Trichoioma is as varied in its habitat. I have 
found it on vacant lots in Philadelphia, in mixed woods at Devon, Pa., 
and in the forests of the West Virginia mountains, and eaten it since 
1881. 

It cooks readily and is of mild, agreeable flavor. 

T. ru'tilans Schaeff. rutilo, to be reddish. Pileus fleshy, campanu-

The Fragrant tricholoma has a distinct farinaceous odor and flavor. 
In other respects it closely resembles the Earth-colored tricholoma of 
which it is considered a mere variety. The typical European plant is 
said to be without odor or nearly so and has not been classed among 
the edible species by European writers. But our variety, though not 
high-flavored, is fairly good and entirely harmless. Its cap varies con- 
siderably in color but is some shade of gray or brown. Its center is 
without any prominence or very bluntly prominent, and its surface is 

71 



Agaricacese 

Trichoioma. commonly very obscurely marked with innate fibrils or in small plants 
may have very small flocculose tufts or scales. The flesh is whitish as 
also are the gills, though these sometimes assume a more decided gray- 
ish hue. They are rather broad and loose and sometimes uneven on 
the edge or even split transversely. They are usually deeply excavated 
next the stem and attached to it by a narrow part. The stem is whitish 
or slightly shaded with the color of the cap. It often has a few longi- 
tudinal fibrils, but never any collar. It may be either solid, stuffed or 
spongy within, or in large specimens, hollow. 

The plants grow gregariously or sometimes in tufts on the ground 
under or near trees or in thin woods, especially of pine, or in mixed 
woods. The caps vary from 1-4 in. broad, and the stems from 1-3 in. 
long and from 2-6 lines thick. The plants occur in autumn. In Europe 
there is a variety of this species which also has a farinaceous odor, but 
it differs from our plant in having reddish edges to the gills. It is called 
variety orirubens. Peck, 49th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Var. fragrans is plentiful and gregarious among New Jersey pines. 
October to frost. Other varieties are often found. Specimens found 
by me at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and sent to Professor Peck who identified 
them as var. fragrans Pk., were decidedly umbonate. Gills were easily 
separable from cap. 

Var. fragrans is a favorite. It is pleasant to many, even raw. Plenti- 
ful salting while cooking develops a high and exquisite flavor. 

T. fumes'cens Pk. smoky. PileilS convex or expanded, dry, 
clothed with a very minute appressed tomentum, whitish. Gills narrow, 
crowded, rounded behind, whitish or pale cream color, changing to 
smoky-bine .or blackish where bruised. Stem short, cylindrical, whitish. 
Spores oblong-elliptical, 5-6.5^. 

Pileus i in. broad. Stem I-I-5 in. high, 2-3 lines thick. 

Woods. Columbia county. October. Rare. 

The species is remarkable for the smoky or blackish hue assumed by 
the gills when bruised and also in drying. It is apparently related to 
T. immundum Berk., but in that species the whole plant becomes 
blackish when bruised, and the gills are marked with transverse lines 
and tinged with pink. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

sometimes long and rooting, usually smooth, at times reticulated with 
black fibrils, or is scaly. Distasteful. 

The species is variable in size and color. Stevenson remarks: 
"Scarcely any species has been more confounded with others." It may 
always be safely distinguished by its odor, by its distant gills, by the 
smooth cuticle of the cap cracking into scales, and by the change of 
color to reddish when bruised.

When quite young T. sulphureum is showy and inviting. Its smell

SfJ- broad. PileilS 4-7 cm. broad. Stem 5-7 cm. long, 6-12 mm. thick. 

The central part of the pileus is sometimes a little darker than the 
rest. The peppery or acrid taste is very distinct and remains in the 
mouth many minutes. This and the innately fibrillose character of the 
pileus are distinguishing characters of the species. The plants appear 
from September to November. Peck, Torr. Bull., Vol. 26.

Agaricaceae 

When T. personatum becomes known to the collector, either in the 
field or on the table, it is sure to become a favorite. It is fleshy, rotund, 
stocky, moist and smooth, with a tendency in its cap to be wavy-rimmed 
and jauntily cocked in wet weather. It grows singly or in troops, oc- 
casionally in tufts of from five to six individuals. A patch of it is valu- 
able and worth husbanding with covering of fine straw. Cortinarius 
violaceus resembles it somewhat in color and shape, but it shows a spi- 
dery veil, and has brown spores. It is edible. 

The common name of T. personatum in England is Blewits, which 
translated into understandable English is believed to be "blue-hats." 
It is everywhere eaten, being of substantial substance, good flavor and 
cookable in any way. It is especially fine in patties, stews and cro- 
quettes.

CLITO'CYBE Fr. 

Gr. sloping. (From the depression of the pileus.) 

PileilS generally fleshy, becoming thin toward the margin, flexible or ciitocybe. 
tough, plane or depressed, margin involute. Gills adnate or decurrent, 
never sinuate. Stem confluent and homogeneous with flesh of pileus, 
somewhat elastic, with a spongy stuffing, frequently becoming hollow, 
externally fibrous. Universal veil when present conspicuous on the 
pileus like frost or silky dew, but commonly wanting. 

Growing on the ground, frequently in groups. The thinner and 
hygrophanous species appear late in autumn. Some are quite fragrant. 
Collybia, Mycena and Omphalia are separated by their stems being car- 
tilaginous, not externally fibrous as in Ciitocybe. Tricholoma by its 
sinuate gills. 

Variations in species of Ciitocybe are great. A few are easily fixed 
in the genus, but many of them will puzzle the amateur and perplex 
the expert. The gills are always attached to the stem, and usually run 
down it. They are not notched next to the stem as in Tricholoma. 

Like Tricholoma, Ciitocybe has many species, most of which are com- 
mon, and are probably edible. I therefore give Professor Peck's de- 
scription of all Clitocybes thus far submitted to him. 

I know of but one species which is injurious to some persons Ciito- 
cybe illudens. Many eat and enjoy it. It does not agree with others. 
A few untried species are suspicious to a like extent. Ciitocybe illu- 
dens possesses the property of phosphorescence. 

Several species of Ciitocybe have not been seen or tested by me, nor 
have I information that these have been tested.

C. nebllla'risBatsch. nebula, a cloud. (Plate XXIV, fig. 7, p. 82.) 
The Clouded clitocybe, Clitocybe nebularis, takes its name from the 
clouded-gray appearance of its thick cap, which is at first convex, but 
when mature, either flat or a little depressed. Its flesh is white, thick- 
est in the middle, and in a vertical section is seen to taper rapidly down- 
ward into the stem. The gills are close together and rather narrow for 
the size of the plant. They are white or yellowish-white. The stout 
solid stem usually tapers upward from the base and is whitish. 

The cap is two to four inches or more broad, the stem one to two 
inches long and about half an inch thick. The Clouded mushroom 
grows in woods, and sometimes forms large tufts or clusters among fallen 
leaves. It is found in autumn, but is not very common in this country. 
Authors differ in their estimate of the edible qualities of this mushroom, 
but the more recent ones generally agree in classing it as edible . ' ' Mush-

September. 

This species is intermediate between C. nebularis and C. clavipes. 
In its general appearance, and in the character of the pileus and stem, 
it resembles C. nebularis, but in the character of the more distant gills 
and in the size of the spores it is nearer C. clavipes, of which it might 
perhaps be regarded as a variety. Two forms are distinguishable. In 
one the gills are more distant, slightly rounded behind, and adnate or 
abruptly terminated ; in the other they are closer and more distinctly 
decurrent. The plant is edible. Peck, 42d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

I have known this fungus very favorably since 1883, and regard it as 
one of the best. I have seen it in the West Virginia mountains only, 
but it will probably be found in cool, shaded, high localities all over the 
country. Both it and the C. nebularis are well worthy df search.

Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

A pale form of this species grows on sandy soil, in which the pileus 
is smoky white, but it becomes grayish-brown in drying. The mycelium 
binds together a mass of sand, so that when the plant is taken up 
carefully a little ball of sandy soil adheres to the base of the stem. The- 
stem is sometimes pruinose. The flavor is mild and agreeable. Peck,

This large and robust fungus is closely allied to C. Candida Bres., 
from which it differs in the naked margin of the pileus, the absence of 
any marked odor and especially in the more elliptical shape of its spores. 
The same plant has been collected in Maryland by Mr. L. J. Atwater, 
who considers it edible, having eaten it with satisfaction and safety.

Agaricacese 

Clitocybe. This fungus is quite plentiful in Pennsylvania and in open oak woods 
in New Jersey. Its size and sometimes gregarious growth give it a 
permanent food value. Its texture is coarse, but when cooked it is 
highly satisfactory. 

C. gallina'cea Scop.- t -/w//ww f a hen. Application not apparent.

Pileus 1-3 in. broad. Stem 2-4 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Open places, grassy ground, etc. Albany and Sandlake. June and 
October. This species forms dense tufts, often composed of many in- 
dividuals. In this respect it is related to such species as C. tumulosa, 
C. aggregata and C. illudens. From the crowding together of many 
individuals the pileus is often irregular. Sometimes the disk is brown- 
ish and occasionally slightly silky. The gills are sometimes slightly 
sinuate, thus indicating a relationship to the species of Tricholoma. The 
taste, though mild, is somewhat oily and unpleasant. The plants appear 
in wet, rainy weather, either early in the season or in autumn. Speci- 
mens have been sent to me from Massachusetts by R. K. Macadam and 
Professor Farlow, and from Pennsylvania by Dr. W. Herbst. Peck, 
43d Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

The early spring clusters are remarkable for their tenderness and 
excellence. Clusters of hundreds of individuals grew abundantly at Mt. 
Gretna in May, 1899. When the fungus was young the gills were

Clitocybe. sometimes adnate, almost free, often decurrent. The varying color of 
oysters is well seen in C. multiceps. 

Edible. They should be well cooked. The addition of a little lemon 
juice or sherry conceals a slight raw taste sometimes present.

firm, solid, long, smooth, tapering at the base. 

Height 5-8 in., breadth of pileus 4-6 in. Stem 6-8 lines thick. 

Spores 4- 5 yx Peck. 

Grows in clumps or large masses about stumps or decaying trees from 
August to October. Its bright, deep yellow is attractive from a distance. 
As many as fifty plants may form a cluster. Cap from 2-6 in., fleshy, 
convex or expanded, often with a raised center directly over the stem; 
flesh juicy and yellow; gills yellow, widely separated, running down 
stem unequally; stem long, firm, solid, smooth, tapering toward base. 
When cooked the taste is rather saponaceous. Strong stomachs can 
retain a meal of them, but the fungus generally sickens the eater. 
Many testings show it to contain a minor poison. It is not deadly, but 
should not be eaten. Bull. No. 2, Phila. Myc. Center. 

New York, Peck, Rep. 23-49. Well known in southern states. 
Indiana, H. I. Miller. 

The mysterious property of phosphorescence is possessed by this 
fungus. As heat is known to develop in masses of the fungus it is of 
interest to know whether it is from the phosphorescence or a ferment. 
Its radiance by night surpasses its splendor by day. Mr. H.I. Miller, 
of Terre Haute, Ind., first drew the writer's attention to this quality. 
A large box of specimens sent by him retained their luminous quality 
after three days of travel to such an extent that the print of a newspaper 
could be read when held close to the mass. 

Mr. Miller writes: "There is something about this fungus which 
generates heat. When I bring in a basketful of it. for the pleasure its 
phosphorescence affords my friends, I find that after having been in the 
6asket for two or three hours, and while piled one bunch upon top of 
another, that to insert one's hand among the different clusters is like 
putting it close to a hot stove."

Leucosporae 

This fungus is so inviting in quantity and beauty that one turns from ciitocybe. 
it with a regret that lingers. Eaten in quantity it acts upon some persons 
as an emetic. I have several times eaten of it without other than 
pleasurable sensations, but persons partaking of the same cooking have 
been sickened. 

C. fumo'sa Pers. fumus, smoke. Pileus 1-3 in. across, fleshy, mar-

Var. polius found growing in large quantities in Boston navy yard in 
stone barn. Determined by Professor Peck. A fair edible. R. K. 
Macadam. 

This woods-growing Ciitocybe has been many times found by me in 
a hot-house in Haddonfield, N. J. Professor Peck confirmed my iden- 
tification. Either its spores or mycelium had evidently been carried 
thither in the wood-earth used by florists. The hot-house crops ap- 
peared in March, and continued until June. 

Several of the plants showed an effort to comply with some condi- 
tion unusual to them, by producing gills upon the upper side of the 
pileus. Those below were venose and crisped. 

This wild species had thus been brought into cultivation. The culti- 
vated plants were much more tender than the wild. Both are excellent. 

C. COnnex'a Pk. connexus, joined. From its relation to Tricholoma.

The gills sometimes terminate rather abruptly and are not strongly 
decurrent, hence it might easily be mistaken for a Tricholoma. The 
margin of the pileus is sometimes marked with slight ridges as in Ag. 
laterarius. The odor is weak but aromatic and agreeable. Peck, 26th

Pileus depressed from the first, then broadly, i. e., plano-infundibuli- 
form, thin but equally fleshy, soft, not flaccid, but easily splitting from 
the margin toward the center (almost papery and involute when old), 
upward of a foot broad, often excentric and generally sinuately lobed, 
moist and adpressedly downy when growing, slightly flocculose and 
cracked into scales when dry; margin at first very thin, involute, 
pubescent, soon spreading, glabrous, at length revolute, coarsely fur- 
rowed or radiately wrinkled. Gills slightly decurrent, closely crowded, 
almost 3 lines broad (23 times as broad as thickness of flesh of pileus), 
connected by veins, thin, fragile, straight, but sometimes varying to 
crisped and anastomosing, whitish then yellowish or tinged with rufous, 
smell weak. Fries. 

This species was placed in Ciitocybe in Syst. Myc. and Epicrisis, but 
in Hym. Europ. Fries removed it to Paxillus in which he is followed by 
Stevenson. Cooke and Massee continue it in Ciitocybe. Dr. Somers

The pileus is always very dry because the surface absorbs moisture. 
Odor weak, pleasant, almost that of A. infundibuliformis. On account 
of its gigantic stature and color, it has often been interchanged with A. 
gigantea Sow. ; it is in no wise, however, allied to that species, but is so 
closely allied to A. infundibuliformis that it might be taken for a very 
luxuriant form of it. Stevenson.

C. infundibulifor'mis Schaeff . infundibulum t a funnel ; forma, form. 
(Plate XXIV, fig. n, p. 82.) The Funnel-form clitocybe, Clitocybe 
infundibuliformis, is a neat and pretty species easily recognized by the 
funnel shape of its mature cap and by its pale red color. When very 
young the cap is slightly convex and often adorned with a slight umbo 
in its center. As it matures the margin becomes elevated so that the 
cap assumes a shape somewhat resembling that of a wine glass. The 
margin is sometimes wavy. The flesh is thin and white. The gills are 
close, thin, white or whitish and decurrent. The stem is smooth, col- 
ored like or a little paler than the cap and mostly tapering from the 
base upward. 

The cap is 2-3 in. broad, the stem I % 3 in. long and K-> in. thick. 

The funnel-shaped mushroom grows in woods or copses in summer 
and autumn, especially in wet seasons. It is somewhat variable in color, 
but is usually a pale-red, tinged with buff, and sometimes becoming 
more pale with age. It delights to grow among fallen leaves, and often 
there is an abundant white cottony mycelium at the base of the stem. 
When it grows in clusters the caps are apt to be irregular because of 
mutual pressure. "Mushrooms and Their Use." Peck.

and remains in the mouth a long time. Two persons were made ill by 
eating it, but their sickness lasted only about three hours. Peck.

A form occurs with a decidedly bulbous base. Gills appearing emar- 
ginate with a decurrent tooth. 

Ciitocybe laccata is made the type of a new genus by Berkeley and 
Broome. Massee accepts the genus but it is not generally accepted by 
the standard authors. It is a well defined genus, and a fitting place for 
C. laccata, C. amethystina, C. ochropurpurea, C. tortilis, which it 
puzzles anyone to identify as Ciitocybe.

"In my opinion it is a good species and should be kept distinct as 
Bolton gave it, and not be tacked on to C. laccata as a variety. I should 
write it Ciitocybe amethystina Bolt." Peck, letter September 17, 1897. 

New York, Peck, Rep. 41; New Jersey, Sterling; Mt. Gretna, Pa.,

Generally included in C. laccata as a variety, and has therefore been 
reported under that name. 

Great quantities of C. amethystina grew in troops on beds made up 
of wood earth about the cottages at Mt. Gretna, Pa. The woods over 
them is dense. 

The caps are tough, but they cook readily and make a pleasing dish. 

C. tor'tilis Bolt. tortilis, twisted. PileilS membranaceous, convexo-

Hard ground in an old road. Sandlake. August. A species closely 
allied to C. laccata and appearing like an irregular dwarf form of that 
species. Sometimes cespitose. Peck, 4ist Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Excepting that this fungus is frequently found with C. laccata, and 
might be taken for a new species if not here described, it would not be 
separated from C. laccata. 

Its edible qualities are similar. 

C. ochropurpu'rea Berk. ochra, ocher; purpureus, purple. (Plate

Leucosporae 

Its spores darken when shed in quantity, have a granulated and light- ciitocybe. 
lilac appearance. It is a solitary grower, sometimes reaching the height 
of six inches. The upturned, wavy pileus, showing the purple gills in 
contrast with the pale Naples-yellow of the cap is markedly attractive. 
The stem is often rough with fibers, hard and tough. The caps are 
tough. It grows in grassy woods and open places. The novice, even 
the expert, will be puzzled to place it in its genus. 

Specimens were sent to me by Miss Lydia M. Patchen, Westfield, 
N. Y., and E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J. I afterward found many at 
Mt. Gretna, Pa. I reported their edible qualities to Prof. Peck who 
wrote, September 3, 1897: "I have often wished it was edible, but it 
has such a disagreeable flavor when fresh that I have never ventured to 
eat it. I have known it to be mistaken for the common mushroom, 
but not eaten." 

Though tough it cooks tender and is excellent. Stew and put in 
patties or croquettes.

Agaricaceae 

COLLY'BIA Fr. 

Gr. a small coin. 

CoUybia. PileilS fleshy, usually thin, margin incurved at first, not corrugated. 
Stem different in substance from the pileus, but confluent with it; hol- 
low, with a cartilaginous bark, internally cartilaginous or soft, often 
rooting. Gills free or obtusely adnexed, membranaceous, soft. 

Growing on the ground, wood, leaves and decaying fungi. 

In Clitocybe and Tricholoma the substance of the stem and pileus is 
alike; they differ in the character of the stem. Tricholoma has no 
distinct bark-like coat, and in Clitocybe the stem is covered with mi- 
nute fibers. In Mycena as in Collybia the stem is different in substance 
from the pileus, but is distinguished by the margin of the pileus being 
straight. It is most closely allied to Marasmius, which is characterized 
by its tough coriaceous substance, which when dried fully revives and 
expands on being moistened. The line between them can not always 
be closely drawn, and there are numerous species which it is difficult to 
place with certainty in either genus. This does not apply to the fleshy 
edible species of this genus as they are quite distinct from Marasmius. 

Peck's 49th Report contains a monograph of the New York species 
of Collybia, supplemented by one of those found in other states. 

Several common, prolific, long-season, delicious fungi occur in this 
genus. They vary in size from " a small coin " to five inches across. 
They grow in woods, on wood, on ground, on leaves, on lawns and 
among moss and grass in shaded places. The writer has tested many 
species raw, and eaten small quantities cooked, which are not herein 
described for the reason that not enough of a species was found to test 
to full extent. So far as is reported and as his experience goes, there is 
not a poisonous species in Collybia. Many of them are strong in odor.

able. I began eating it in 1881, and it has continued to be a favorite. 
The caps should be broiled or fried. They are sweet, pleasing in texture, 
and delicately flavored. 

C. platyphyl'la Fr. Gr. broad; a leaf. (Plate XXIXa, fig. i,

at the apex, whitish, shortly and bluntly rooted at the base. Gills ob- 
liquely cut off behind, slightly adnexed, / in. and more broad, distant, 
soft, white. 

Odor not remarkable. It inclines toward the Tricholomata in the 
somewhat membranaceous cuticle of the soft stem. Fries.

Solitary, gregarious, rarely clustered. On rotten wood, roots, ground 
near stumps, among leaves, etc. June to October. 

Distinguished by the very broad and deeply emarginate gills, which 
frequently slope up behind to near the cap then with a short turn down- 
ward connect with the stem which is either stuffed or hollow, and by 
the abundant, cord-like rooting mycelium. The gills are very broad. 
Professor Peck says: "The species is quite variable. The pileus is 
sometimes irregular and even eccentric, the thin margin may be slightly 
striate, is often split and in wet weather may be upturned or revolute. 
The lamellae are sometimes 3 in. broad or more and transversely split. 
They may be obscurely striated transversely and even veiny above with

Excepting from California, C. longipes has not previously been re- 
ported as found in the United States. It is not plentiful in the forests 
of West Virginia, yet I often found it upon rotting stumps and logs, 
solitary, but up to a dozen in the same vicinity. It is unmistakable. Its

West Virginia, 1882, Mcllvaine. 

In the West Virginia mountains C. fusipes is frequent. Caps in the 
clusters rarely exceed I %. in. across. They show an auburn or bur- 
gundy shade of brown in their color. When young they are smooth 
and appear to remain so unless rained upon or moistened, when they 
crack more or less finely in drying. At first the connection of the gills 
with the stem is peculiar they join in a collar-like ring at the top of the 
stem. As the cap expands the gills part more or less and separate 
from the stem. The stem is markedly spindle-shaped, though variously 
flattened by compression in dense clusters; the outside often splitting, 
breaking and turning out from the stem. 

The caps, alone, are good, the stem being hard and refractory. The 
caps are very fine, cooked in any way. 

The caps dry well, and are a pleasant addition to gravies, soups and 
other dishes. They make a choice pickle.

at i-i K . It is generally found in clusters more or less dense. The CoUybia. 
color varies from yellowish to a dark yellowish-brown. The center is 
darker than the margin. The cap viscid when moist, often irregular 
from crowding. Gills may be rounded or notched at their attachment 
to the stem, whitish or yellowish. Stem usually hollow, 1-4 in. long, 
1-3 lines thick, whitish when young becoming colored with the dense 
brownish velvety hairs. 

It grows on stumps, roots in the ground, trunks and earth heavily 
charged with wood matter. I have found it in every month of the year. 
The heavier crop appears in September, October and November, and 
lasts until long after heavy frosts. Then sporadic clusters spring up 
wherever the winter sun gives them encouragement. 

It sometimes does considerable damage to the tree so unfortunate as 
to be its host. It begins its growth upon some injured or decayed spot 
and by continually insinuating itself under the surrounding bark it, by 
its mycelium and growth, pries the bark away from the wood until the 
tree is entirely denuded. 

It is a valuable species, not only on account of its continuous growth, 
but because of its plentifulness and excellent substance.

dense somewhat pulverulent whitish pubescence or down. Spores 
minute ovate or subelliptical, slightly pointed- at one end, 56x34/1. 

Among fallen leaves in woods. Common. July to October. 

The plants commonly grow in tufts, but sometimes in lines or arcs of 
circles or scattered. They revive under the influence of moisture and 
thereby indicate an intimate relationship to the genus Marasmius. The 
pileus varies much in color, but commonly has a dull reddish or russety 
tinge when moist, sometimes approaching bay-red. It fades in drying 
and becomes almost white or grayish-white, but sometimes the center 
remains more deeply colored than the margin. The stem is commonly

somewhat flattened either at the top or throughout its entire length. 
Sometimes the stems become united at the base which union is sug- 
gestive of the specific name. Peck, 49th Rep.

C. dryophila is so common and variable that descriptions would fail 
to cover it in its eccentricities. The writer has eaten it in all the forms 
obtained since 1881. A very pretty form grew in large quantities 
among pine needles at Eagle's Mere, Pa., in August, 1897. It was 
cooked and served at the hotel table. Many ate it and were delighted. 

Dr. Badham refers to a case in which illness was caused by eating it. 
In my eighteen years' experience with it, knowing it to have been en- 
joyably eaten by scores of persons, I have not heard of the slightest 
discomfort from it.

Agaricaceee 

Mycena. Mycena is a large genus composed of small species. About sixty 
members have been found in America. They are from % to I in. 
across the cap, with thin stems and altogether delicate appearance. Yet 
the flesh of most of them has a gummy consistency in the mouth, and 
they shrink but little in stewing. Heretofore not any appear to have 
been reported as edible, probably because the size of the species has not 
attracted experimenters. While some have a strong odor and taste of 
radishes, and one species is bitter, it is probable that all are edible. 
The writer has eaten, raw and cooked, small quantities (all he has found) 
of many species not here reported as edible, which will, when further 
tested, be reported upon. 

The substance and flavor of those here given is remarkably pleasant. 
Their late coming, hardiness and abundance are commendable qualities.

occurs also solitary, larger, pileus as much as 2 in. broad, wrinkled-

are these : Stem in general thinner, less tense and straight, often curved, 
more fragile. Pileus membranaceous, conico bell-shaped, umbonate, 
striate but not corrugated, moist in rainy weather. Gills adnate, with 
a decurrent tooth, more crowded, whitish then flesh-colored. The color 
both of the pileus (normally dingy-brownish then livid) and of the stem 
(normally becoming livid-brownish) is much more changeable than that 
of A. rugosa, becoming yellow, rust colored, etc. It is not so tough 
and pliant as A. rugosa. Forms departing from the type are very nu- 
merous; the most beautiful is var. calopus (6V., beautiful; Gr. , afoot) 
with chestnut-colored stems, united in a spindle-shaped tail. Fries.

Common. Autumnal. Very variable. On trunks, fallen leaves. 

Two well-marked varieties of this very variable species were observed 
the past season. One grows on the ground among fallen leaves. It has 
a dark brown pileus, close lamellae and a very long stem, generally of a 
delicate pink color toward the top. It might be called var. longipcs. 
The other grows under pine trees, has a broadly convex or expanded 
grayish-brown pileus and a short stem. It might be called var. expansns.

' 'M. alcalina is closely allied to it (M. galericulata), but has a stronger 
alkaline odor and a rather more fragile stem. In one of your specimens 
I detect a slight incarnate tint to the gills, and this is pretty conclusive 
evidence that it belongs to M. galericulata. Species of Mycena are not 
generally reckoned among edible fungi or even promising fungi; I sup- 
pose on account of the thin flesh of the cap, but of course it is possible 
to make up in numbers what is lacking in size. I am glad to know you 
have found this to be an esculent one. " Letter Professor Peck to C. 
Mcllvaine, October 5, 1893. 

The caps and stems when young make as good a dish as one cares to 
eat. The substance is pleasant, and the flavor delicate. They are best

The American species of Omphalia number between thirty-five and Omphaiia. 
forty. Many of them are common. Few woods are free from them. 
Several of them are beautiful. They are usually small and lacking in 
substance. Raw, the writer has not found one that is objectionable in 
any way; a few have a woody taste. But two species have been found 
by him in sufficient quantity to make a dish. It is probable that all are 
edible. At best the species of Omphalia are valuable in emergency only.

The quantity alone, in which this small species can be found, makes 
it worth mentioning as an edible species. It is common over the United 
States where coniferous trees abound. Its favorite habitat is upon the 
rotting debris of these trees. Occasionally it grows from the ground, 
but only from that which is heavily charged with woody material. It 
is social in troops, or affectionate in clusters, or maintains a single ex- 
istence. 

It is edible, of good substance when stewed, tender and of fair flavor.

Gr. a side ; Gr. an ear. 

Stem excentric, lateral or none. Epipliytal (very rarely growing on pieurotus.

The excentric, generally lateral stem, absent in some of the species, 
separates this from other genera of the white-spored series. 

Pileus varying from fleshy in the larger to membranaceous in the 
smaller forms, but never becoming woody. Veil generally wanting, 
when present its remains sometimes appear on the margin of the pileus, 
or as an evanescent ring on the stem. Gills, edge acute, generally de- 
current, in some species with a well-marked tooth, rarely simply adnate. 
Stem fleshy, confluent and homogeneous with the pileus. 

Wood, dead or alive; a few species appear on the ground. 

P. ulmarius and others of the larger forms, when growing in an up- 
right position, may have the stem central and the pileus horizontal. 
The stems of some species of Clitocybe and Omphalia if growing later- 
ally are sometimes excentric and oblique. 

This genus is analogous to Claudopus, pink-spored, and Crepidotus, 
brown-spored. 

Spores white, but those of P. sapidus are faintly tinged with lilac, 
and of P. ostreatus, var. euosmus, with purple.

Pieurotus. If any odium attaches to the word toadstool, it should be forgotten 
and forever banished in presence of this cleanly, neat, handsome genus, 
choice in its growing places from lichen-covered stumps, or bark-clad 
boles, or highly perched limbs, or the scented surfaces of decaying 
wood. Several of its species perfume themselves throughout with pleas- 
ant spicy odors. Many are most accommodating in their constant 
coming. 

Mr. H. I. Miller, superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis Rail- 
road, writes: "Most of the mushroom books give greatest space to the 
A. campester. For some parts of the country this may be desirable, 
but for Indiana and Ohio, considering the food value, the P. ostreatus 
is the best fungus we have in these states, from the fact that anybody 
wanting a mess can nearly always obtain a basketful of this variety, 
whereas the others depend upon a good many weather conditions. 
Having located a few logs and stumps in the spring, where the P. ostre- 
atus grows, these same stumps and logs can be used all season. The 
crops are successive, and while some of the spots seem to be barren for 
a few days at a time, the others will be bearing. It does not make 
much difference what the kind of log or stump, whether it be beech, 
oak or elm, or what the species of tree. I think I have found them on 
all our forest trees, and it is not necessary for the tree to be dead. If 
there is a decaying portion, the spores seem to be carried by the little 
black beetle that infests the ostreatus, from one place to another, and 
wherever a small spot of dead wood is found we are likely to find the P. 
ostreatus. This being the only edible mushroom that we can find in 
large quantities all through the season in this neck of the woods, it 
seems to me that a general knowledge of it will serve the economic pur- 
pose more than any other fungi." 

The presence of the P. ostreatus and its esculent companions is noted 
from our northern boundary to the gulf. Poplar, maple, birch, hick- 
ory, ash, apple, laburnum and oak trees are its favored residences. 
Deer feed upon it, and kine are attracted by its scent even when deep 
under snow. When properly selected and slowly cooked, the Pleuroti 
are toothsome. 

From the fact that the spores of this fleshy and valuable genus find 

136 



Leucosporae 

fostering lodgment in many trees when in decay, it is more than prob- Pieurotus. 
able that the several species can be propagated by planting their spores 
upon such decaying woods, or by transplanting the mycelium. 

Growths of P. ostreatus, P. sapidus, P. salignus, and probably other 
species of Pieurotus, can be forced, by watering the spots upon which 
they are known to grow. Dr. Kalchbrenner mentions that the P. 
sapidus is in this way cultivated in Hungary. Acting upon this men- 
tion the writer had good success with P. ostreatus. Experiments in 
this direction are likely to be interesting and rewarding. 

No species is suspected of being noxious.

The gills are sometimes torn across like those of Lentinus. 

The historic elms of Boston Common have borne copious crops of 
this well-known and easily distinguished species from time immemorial. 
Every fall, about the first of September, if the season is favorable, later 
if not, copious crops appear decorating the trunks, and branches, some- 
times at a height of thirty or forty feet. Growth takes place where 
branches have broken off or the trees have been wounded from other 
causes. They occur very generally on elms in the outlying districts of 
the city, but are rare in the country, seeming to be distinctly urban in 
their tastes. No damage is apparent from their growth. 

Immediately in the rear of Independence Hall, Philadelphia, a fine 
cluster appears with equal autumnal regularity. 

Though the elm tree is the chosen habitat of this fungus, it is little 
less select in its choice than other members of its genus.

Not observed in England until 1887. 

Quite common throughout the United States, growing upon decaying 
wood, whether above or under ground. It has few distinct features. 
The only positive one distinguishing it from P. ostreatus is its lilac- 
tinted spores. The tint is faint but noticeable upon white background. 
Excepting for purposes of the student, its separation, as a species, from 
P. ostreatus is not necessary. When old it has more body than the 
latter, but is equally superior as a food fungus. 

Professor Peck remarks of it: "A stew made of it is a very good 
substitute for an oyster stew." 

It can be cultivated by watering the places upon which it is known to 
appear.

tered small wart-like or glandular bodies. 

On trunks. A very constant but somewhat rare variety ; easily known 
by the dark-brown pileus. The gland-like bodies on the gills are due 
to the outward growth of the hyphae of the trama in minute patches 
here and there. Massee. 

Var. euosmus Berk. strong-smelling. Strong scented, imbricate. 
Pileus fleshy, depressed, shining, silky when dry, at first white with a

On elm trunks. Pilei very much crowded, 2 in. or more across, 
deeply depressed, unequal, at first white, invested with a slight blue 
varnish, at length of a pale brown. Stems distinct above, connate be- 
low. Gills rather broad ; running down to the bottom of the free por- 
tion of the stem. Spores oblong, narrow, oblique, white, tinged with 
purple. The whole plant smells, when first gathered, strongly of tarra- 
gon. B. and Br. 

Found at Richmond, Ind., Dr. J. R. Weist. On hickory stump at 
Mt. Gretna, Pa., Mcllvaine; Haddonfield, N. J., T. J. Collins. 

This esculent fungus closely allied to P. ostreatus, and differing only 
in having lilac spores, has been followed from book to book by a bad 
reputation, probably because of its "rosy" or lilac spores all fungi 
having pink spores having been, until recently, ignorantly branded by 
authors as poisonous. The writer has eaten meals of it many times, as 
have his friends. It is in every way equal to P. ostreatus. 

The rare qualities of this species are stated in the descriptive heading 
of the genus. Its very name implies excellence. The camel is grate- 
fully called the ship of the desert ; the oyster mushroom is the shell- 
fish of the forest. When the tender parts are dipped in egg, rolled in 
bread crumbs, and fried as an oyster they are not excelled by any vege- 
table, and are worthy of place in the daintiest menu. 

P. salig'nus Schwam. salix, willow. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, sooty

Agaricaceee 

Pieurotus. ash-color or ochraceous, fleshy, compact, spongy, somewhat dimidiate, 
horizontal, at first pulvinate, even, at length depressed behind and here 
and there strigose, the incurved margin entire. Stem always short, 
firm, more or less tomentose. Gills horizontal, hence less manifestly 
decurrent, separate behind, but branched in the middle, crowded, dingy, 
often eroded at the edge, not glandular. 

Among the larger and firmer species. Solitary, scarcely ever cespi- 
tose. It is commonly confounded with A. ostreatus, but is certainly a 
different species. Although the stature is in general the same, it is 
easily distinguished by the pileus being more compact, and more pul- 
verulent when young, then depressed, by the gills being thinner, more 
crowded, somewhat branched, but not anastomosing behind, and dingy 
soot-color; the spores also are dingy. Stevenson. 

Spores oblong or cylindrical-oblong, 8x4/4 W.G.S.; 8-10x3-4/1^. 

Dr. Curtis wrote of this: "Indeed I have found several persons who 
class this among the most palatable species. To such persons a dish 
of fresh mushrooms need seldom be wanting, as this one can be had 
every month of the year in this latitude." 

In New Jersey, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Pa., I have found P. 
salignus in quantity. It has been sent to me by Dr. J. R. Weist, of 
Richmond, Ind., who writes, "I have eaten it with great enjoyment." 

In 1 88 1 I found it frequently on water beeches and willows, and thor- 
oughly tested its edible qualities. R. K. Macadam, Boston. 

When young or fresh, it is quite equal to any Pieurotus. When old, 
as with others of the Pleuroti, it is tough. Nevertheless their margins 
are always edible unless decaying.

sometimes channeled above, grayish-tomentose. Spores elliptical, 7.6x 
45^ broad; odor and taste farinaceous. 

Ground. Sandlake. June. Edible. 

It grows singly or in tufts and is an inch or more in height. The 
margin is thin and sometimes striatulate and reflexed. Toward the 
base the flesh is thicker than the breadth of the gills. The cuticle is 
tough' and separable. The flesh is said by Gillet to be tender and 
delicate. Persoon describes the disk as spongy-squamulose, but in our 
specimens it is merely pubescent or tomentose. Peck, 39th Rep. N. Y. 
State Dot. 

Recorded as edible by Professor Peck. At Eagle's Mere, Pa., I 
found many specimens agreeing with this description. They grew from 
decaying wood under ground, yet had the appearance of growing from 
the earth. It is probable that others have been deceived. In quality 
I found this to be one of the best. 

P. sero'tinus Fr. late. PileuS fleshy, 1-3 in. broad, compact, 
convex or nearly plane, viscid when young and moist, dimidiate kid- 
ney-shaped or suborbicular, solitary or cespitose and imbricated, vari- 
ously colored, dingy-yellow, reddish-brown, greenish-brown or olivace- 
ous, the margin at first involute. Gills close, determinate, whitish or 
yellowish. Stem very short, lateral, thick, yellowish beneath and min- 
utely tomentose or squamulose with blackish points. Spores minute, 
elliptical, 5/x long, 2.5/x. broad.

pienrotns. The species is not noticeably viscid after its youth. The viscidity 
can be detected in old specimens by moistening the pileus. Its flavor 
is not marked, nor is its texture as pleasing as most others of its genus, 
but being a late species it satisfies the longing of the mycophagist for 
his accustomed food. 

P. pulmona'rillS Fr. pulmo, lung, from texture. PileilS 2-3 in. 
broad, ash-colored, continuous with the stem, fleshy, soft, but tough, 
flaccid, obovate or kidney-shaped, plane or reflexo-conchate at the mar- 
gin, even, smooth. Flesh thin, soft, white. Stem very short, solid, 
exactly lateral, horizontal or ascending, round, villous, expanded into 
the pileus. Gills decurrent but ending determinate ly , moderately broad, 
distinct, not branched or anastomosing at the base, livid or ash-color. 

The primary form is solitary. The pileus is ashy-tan when dried. It 
differs from A. salignus alike in the definitely lateral stem and in the 
thin flaccid pileus. Fries. 

Not previously reported. 

Found by Miss Madeleine Le Moyne, Washington, Pa., September, 
1898, and sent to writer. Gills 3 lines broad, not narrow in proportion 
to flesh. 

Taste and smell similar to P. ostreatus. Cooked it is tender, and 
more succulent than P. ostreatus. 

Ill . RESUPINA'TI. 

P. mastruca'tus Tic.~mastnica, a sheepskin. Pileus up to 2 in. 
long and I in. broad, sessile, at first resupinate then expanded and 
horizontal, often lobed, upper stratum of pileus gelatinous, brown, 
bristling with squarrose or erect squamules. Flesh thickish. Gills 
radiating from the point of attachment, broad, rather distant, grayish- 
white. 

On old trunks. Imbricated. Readily distinguished by the brown, 
squarrosely scaly pileus. Massee. 

Spores oblong, oblique, 8x5ft Morgan. 

In June, 1886, the writer found this species in oak woods near Phila- 
delphia. It grew on fallen trunks and on decaying spots of living 
timber. 

It is edible, and of good flavor, but is rough in the mouth. If found 
in quantity, the extract of it would make a delicate soup.

HYGROPHORUS PRATENSIS. 



HYGROPH'ORUS Fr. 

Gr. moist; Gr. to bear. 

Pileus regular or undulated and wavy, often viscid or moist. Flesh Hygrophorus. 
of the pileus continuous with that of (Plate XXXVIII.) 

the stem and descending as a trama 
into the gills. Gills adnate or ad- 
nexed, more or less decurrent, waxy, 
often thick and forked, edge always 
tliin and sharp, often branched. 

On the ground. Many species are 
brightly colored. Spores white. 

This genus differs from the pre- 
ceding genera in the manifest trama, 
the substance of which is similar to 
that of the pileus ; from Lactarius 

and Russula by the trama not being vesicular, but somewhat floccose 
with granules intermixed ; from Cantharellus, its nearest ally, by the 
sharp edge of the gills. The Cortinarii, Paxilli and Gomphidii are at 
once distinguished from it by their colored spores and the changing color 
of their gills, as well as by other marks. From all the other genera of 
Agaricini it is distinguished by a mark peculiar to itself, viz., by the 
hymeneal stratum of the gills changing into a waxy mass, which is at 
length removable from the trama. This altogether singular character is 
specially remarkable in H. caprinus, coccineus, murinaceus, etc. Hence 
the gills seem full of watery juice, but they do not become milky like 
those of the Lactarii. Fries. 

From the description by Fries, the author of the genus, it is manifest 
that one has to wait the ripening of the fungus before the peculiar char- 
acteristic mark of the genus, i. e. gills turning into a waxy mass, 
easily removable from the cap can be observed. Many of the species 
are difficult to determine when fresh. Nevertheless, there is an inde- 
scribable, watery, waxy, translucent appearance about the gills which 
catches the eye of the expert, and is soon learned by the novice. The 
white spores readily separate the genus from kindred shapes in the col- 
ored-spored genera. 

So far as tested none of the species is poisonous. One English spe-

Gregarious, and often in tufts, sometimes in partial rings. 

An exceedingly variable species. White, buff, smoky, pinkish colors 
are common. The cap shapes are also diverse. The margins of some 
are incurved; of others repand. The weather seems to have much to 
do with their shapes. 

M. C. Cooke says: " It requires careful cooking, as it is liable to be 
condemned as tough, unless treated slowly, but it is a great favorite 
abroad." He calls them "Buff Caps." 

All fungi are the better for slow cooking. The H. pratensis in all its 
forms is excellent, but particularly so in croquettes and pates.

Flesh sometimes equal, sometimes abruptly thin. Commonly con- 
founded with H. niveus, but it is more difficult to distinguish it from 
white forms of H. pratensis. It is distinguished chiefly by its smaller 
stature, by the color being constantly white, sometimes becoming pale, 
by the obtuse pileus being scarcely turbinate, at length cracked into patches 
and floccose when dry, and by the gills being thinner, etc.

"Mony littles make muckle," says the Scotch proverb. It applies 
well to the brave little toadstool looking through the first grass of lawns 
for the coming of spring, and coming again in the autumn, defiant of 
early frosts. Small though it be, its numbers soon fill the basket. 

The "Ivory Caps" are plentiful, and extend their haunts to the 
woods, where thick mold or grassy places abound.

The H. niveus, H. virgineus, "Ivory Caps" as M. C. Cooke calls 
them, are pretty and plentiful in some sections. In the West Virginia 
mountains, along grass-grown road-sides, their purity and exquisite 
perfume attracted me in 1 88 1. I have them and a few others to thank 
for seducing me into becoming a mycophagist. I think of them affec- 
tionately. I have seldom met with them since. They are found on 
lawns and in pastures and on grassy edges of woods, early in spring and 
late in autumn.

The resemblance to H. miniatus in color is great, but there is a marked 
difference in the gills, which extend further down the thinner stem. It 
is tougher, and takes longer to cook. It has a flavor of its own which 
is enjoyed by some and condemned by others. 

H. COCCl'neilS Schaeff. of a scarlet color. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 6,

This, like H. fuligineus, has a 

short white space at the top of the stem, free from the viscidity that 
exists elsewhere. It resembles in many respects Hygrophorus spe- 
ciosus, which has the pileus red, fading to yellow with advancing age. 
Perhaps the three may yet prove to be forms of one very variable 
species, for the most conspicuous differences between them consist in 
the colors of the pileus. The constancy with which the three styles of 
coloration has thus far been maintained indicates a specific difference, 
but color alone is not generally regarded as having any specific value.

know it. It is easily prepared and requires little cooking." 

I have eaten en joy ably of it since 1881. 

Plentiful in the Jersey pines, in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and 
equal to any toadstool of its size. 

H. fuligi'neilS Frost resembling soot. Pileus convex or nearly 

plane, glabrous, very viscid or glu-

the disk often darker or almost black. 
Gills subdistant, adnate or decurrent, 
white. Stem solid, viscid or gluti- 
nous, white or whitish. Spores ellip- 
tical, 7 9x5 /A. 

The Sooty hygrophorous resembles 
the Club-stemmed clitocybe in the 
color of its cap, but in nearly every 
other respect it is different. When 
moist the cap is covered with an abun- 
dant gluten which when dry gives it a 
shining appearance as if varnished. 
The color varies from grayish-brown 
to a very dark or sooty-brown with 
the central part usually still darker or 

almost black, but never with an umbo. The flesh and the gills are white. 

The stem also is white or but slightly shaded toward the base with the 

color of the cap. It is variable in length and shape, being long or short, 

straight or crooked, everywhere equal in thickness or tapering toward 

the base. It is glutinous and unpleasant to handle. 

The cap is 1-4 in. broad, the stem 2-4 in. long, and 4-8 lines thick. 

The plants grow either singly or in tufts. In the latter case the caps 

are often irregular from mutual pressure. 

The plants occur early in October and November, in pine woods or 

woods of pine and hemlock intermixed. 

This mushroom is tender and of excellent flavor, but its sticky and 

often dirty covering should be peeled before cooking. Peck, 49th Rep.

repand or lobed, very irregular, even, smooth, viscid. Flesh of the same 
color, fragile. Stem 3 in. long, %-\ in. thick, solid when young, at 
length hollow, very stout (not compressed), ventricose (attenuated at 
both ends), striate, and for the most part squamulose at the apex, when 
dry light yellowish or of the same color as the pileus, always white and 
often incurved at the base. Gills ascending, ventricose, 2-4 lines 
broad, thick, distant, white-light yellow or yellow and often reddish at 
the base. Fries. 

The largest of the group and very handsome. It certainly differs 
from H. coccineus, for which it is commonly mistaken, in stature, in 
the adnexed gills, and in the white base of the striate stem. The attach- 
ment of the gills varies, but from the form of the pileus they ascend to 
the base of the cone and appear free.

An old-time cure-all had medicinal virtues proportionate to its offen- 
siveness. Old-time writers, contrariwise, gave every toadstool a bad 
name which changed color or displeased their noses. The pretty little 
Hygrophorus conicus, for these reasons, has, until now, been under the 
ban of suspicion. M. C. Cooke, in his handy book, Edible and Poison- 
ous Mushrooms, was the first to lighten its sentence and make it a sort 
of ticket-of-leave culprit. 

The writer has frequently eaten it, and is glad to vouch for its harm-

Nearly all grow on the ground. 

Distinguished from all other fungi by the presence of a granular milk 
which pervades every part of the plant and especially the gills ; it is 
commonly white, sometimes changing color and in section Dapetes 
highly colored from the first. The nature of the milk, especially its 
taste, whether acrid, subacrid or mild, must be carefully noted in dis- 
tinguishing species, as it is the most useful characteristic. 

In Russula, the only allied genus, the milk-bearing cells are present, 
but their contents do not appear as milk. 

Many of the species are peppery, acrid, astringent; some mildly so, 
others will be long remembered if tasted raw. Yet not a species is hot- 
ter than some radishes, onions, and others of our favorite vegetables. 
Who would condemn them because they are peppery? There is not a 
single species of Lactarius which retains its pepperiness after cooking. 
This quality has to be and is supplied by one of our favorite condiments

been condemned without trial. It is remarkable that not one of the 
fungi known to be deadly gives any warning by appearance or flavor of 
the presence of a poison. The day will probably come when it can be 
said that if toadstool eaters will confine themselves to hot species, other- 
wise attractive, they will run no risk. Panus stypticus is astringent, 
not hot.

Poisonous, and Gillet declares it to be deleterious and even danger- 
ous, and that in the raw state it is a very strong drastic purgative. On 
the other hand, Cordier states that almost all authors agree in stating 
that it is eaten with impunity, and that Letellier has eaten it more than 
once without inconvenience. 

Cooke states: "Whether it is poison is rather uncertain, and prob- 
ably assumed from its acridity." 

Bulliard says: "It is very acrid and this is changed by heat into an 
astringent of such power that a very little suffices to produce the most 
terrible accidents." On the other hand, Boudier says that the pres- 
ence of an acrid milk is an indication of no importance, that in cer- 
tain parts of the country they eat such Lactaria as even L. piperatus 
and do not experience any trouble. Certain Russulae as acrid as any

L. insulsus is another peppery member of Lactarius which has 
suffered unjustly. I have eaten it since 1881, and think it the best of 
the hot milk species. Its flesh is not as coarse as others, and is of 
better flavor. There is little difference in quality between it and L. 
deliciosus. 

L. hys'ghlUS Fr. Gr. a crimson dye. PileilS 2-3 in. broad, rigid,

viscid, zoneless or rarely obscurely zonate, reddish-incarnate, tan-color 
or brownish-red, becoming paler with age, the thin margin inflexed. 
Gills close, adnate or subdecurrent, whitish, becoming yellowish or 
cream-colored. Stem 1-2 in. long, 48 lines thick, equal, glabrous, 
stuffed or hollow, colored like the pileus, or a little paler, sometimes 
spotted. Milk white, taste acrid. 

Woods. Sandlake and Canoga, N. Y. July and August. Not

The reddish hue of the pileus distinguishes this species from its allies. 
The gluten or viscidity of the pileus in our specimens was rather tena-

The specimens which I have referred to this species were found in the 
Catskill mountains several years ago, growing in hemlock woods, under 
spruce and balsam trees. I have not met with the species since. The 
pileus in the larger specimens had a minutely tomentose appearance, 
but in the dried specimens this has disappeared. They also varied in 
color from blackish-brown to pinkish-brown and grayish-brown, but 
they can scarcely be more than a mere form or variety of the species 
the description of which, as given by Fries, I have quoted. In the 
Handbook the pileus is described as dark fuliginous-gray or brown, and 
Gillet describes it as black-brown, dark fuliginous or lead color, and 
adds that the plant is poisonous and the milk very acrid and burning. 
Cordier says that the flesh is white and the taste bitter and disagreeable.

Poisonous. Gillet. 

L. pergame'nilS Fr. parchment. White. Pileus fleshy, pliant,

Milk white, acrid. 

Very much allied to L. piperatus, but differing in the stem being 
stuffed, at length softer internally, elongated, 3 in., unequal, attenu- 
ated downward and here and there ascending, quite smooth; in \hepilens 
being thinner, pliant, elastic, most frequently irregular and excentric, 
for the most part flexuous, at first convex (not umbilicate), then rather 
plane, the surface very smooth, but unpolished and wrinkled in a pecu- 
liar manner ; and in the gills being adnate, not decurrent, very crowded, 
very narrow (scarcely I line broad), always straight and horizontal , not 
arcuate or extended upward, soon straw-color : The flesh is very milky, 
but the gills are sparingly so. Fries.

L. piperatus is a readily distinguished species. It is very common. 
In 1 88 1, after an extensive forest fire in the West Virginia forests, I saw 
miles of the blackened district made white by a growth of this fungus. 
It was the phenomenal growth which first attracted my attention to 
toadstools. I collected it then in quantity and used it, with good results, 
as a fertilizer on impoverished ground. 

It has been eaten for many years in most countries, yet a few writers 
continue to warn against it. It is the representative fungus of its class 
meaty, coarse, fair flavor. It is edible and is good food when one is 
hungry and can not get better. It is best used as an absorbent of 
gravies.

In common with all peppery Lactarii the present species loses the 
quality in cooking. The edible qualities then depend upon texture, 
substance, flavor. The species is coarse but meaty and of fair flavor.

Much smaller than L. piperatus. Pileus convex, then plane with 
depressions in center, margin involute. Gills slightly decurrent, densely 
crowded, very narrow. Stem short, firm, solid. Milk white, very hot. 

L. involutus is readily mistaken for small forms of L. vellereus and 
L. piperatus. The extremely narrow gills, so close and firm that it takes 
sharp eyes to follow them, are a distinguishing mark. 

Its flesh is of same consistency as L. piperatus hard and coarse. It 
loses its pepperiness in cooking and is a good emergency plant, or 
solvent.

America is rich in this section. Fries records but two species, L. 
deliciosus and L. sanguifluus, while America has four. The edible

edible and is well marked by its dark-red milk. Mcllvaine.

specimen with milk distinctly orange, and changing to green. The 
milk in this species varies in color, much depending upon moisture. It 
grows in patches, sometimes in clusters. 

Edible. Curtis. 

There is no question of its edibility. Old and modern writers applaud 
it. Each cooks to his liking and thinks his own way best. It requires 
forty minutes' stewing or baking; less time if roasted or fried. It can 
be cooked in any way, but, like all Lactarii, it must be well cooked.

It is edible, but coarse. Good flavor. 

L. chelido'nium Pk. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, at first convex, then

Spores globose, 7.5ft. Milk sparse, saffron-yellow ; taste mild. 

Sandy soil, under or near pine trees. Saratoga and Bethlehem. 

The milk of this species resembles in color the juice of celandine, 
Chelidonium majus. It is paler than that of L. deliciosus. By this 
character and by the dull color of the pileus, the narrow lamellae, short 
stem and its fondness for dry situations, it may be separated from the 
other species. Wounds of the flesh are at first stained with the color 
of the milk, then with blue, finally with green. A saffron-color is some- 
times attributed to the milk of L. deliciosus, which may indicate that 
this species has been confused with that, or that the relationship of the 
two plants is a closer one than we have assigned to them. Peck, 38th

The relationship of this plant is with L. serifluus, to which it was 
formerly referred, but from which I am now satisfied it is distinct. The 
hollow stem is a constant character in our plant, and affords a ready 
mark of distinction. The plant, though large, is very fragile, and 
breaks easily. The taste is mild or but slightly acrid. Sometimes there 
is an obscure zonation on the pileus, which, in large specimens, is apt 
to be irregular and much worm-eaten. The milk looks like little drops 
of water when first issuing from a wound, but it becomes a little less 
clear on exposure to the atmosphere. The decided but agreeable odor 
of the dried specimens persists a long time. Peck, 28th Rep. 

This plant is sometimes cespitose. The pileus when dry is tawny- 
gray and scaly or cracked scaly. The margin may be even or coarsely

sulcate-striate. The flesh is grayish or reddish-gray. The color of the Lactarins. 
lamellae varies from creamy-white to tawny-yellow. The stem often has 
a conspicuous white myceloid tomentum at its base. I have never 
found this plant with a white or milky juice, and therefore I am dis- 
posed to regard it not as a variety of L. helvus, but as a distinct species. 
Its mild taste and agreeable odor suggested a trial of its edible qualities. 
It is harmless, but the lack of flavor induces me to omit it from the list 
of edible species. Peck, 5Oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Agaricaceae 

Lactarius. Pa. Solitary and gregarious, moist woods and wooded places. July 
to September. Mcllvaine. 

In my long experience with the plant I have not seen any change of 
color, save that, like the white milk of other species, it darkens slightly 
to a cream color. I have found it distinctly umbilicate and quite um- 
bonate in the same patch. 

L. lignyotus is one of the best of Lactarii and quite equal to L. 
volemus. 

L. COrru'gis Pk. having wrinkles or folds. Pileus 3~5 in. broad, 
firm, convex, then nearly plane or centrally depressed, rugose reticulated, 
covered with a velvety pruinosity or pubescence, dark reddish-brown or 
cliestnut-color, fading with age to tawny-brown. Gills close, dark 
cream-color or subcinnamon, becoming paler when old, sordid or brown- 
ish where bruised or wounded. Stem 35 in. long, 612 lines thick, 
equal, solid, glabrous or merely pruinose, paler than but similar in color 
to the pileus. Spores subglobose, 1013^1. Milk copious, white, taste 
mild. 

Thin woods. Sandlake, Gansevoort and Brewerton, N. Y. August 
and September. 

This curious Lactarius is related to L. volemus, from which it may 
be separated by its darker colors and its corrugated pileus. The flexu- 
ous reticulated rugae present an appearance similar to that of the 
hymenium of a Merulius. The pileus is everywhere pruinose-pubescent 
and the gills bear numerous spine-like or acicular cystidia or spicules, 
4 5/tx long. These are so numerous on and near the edges of the gills 
that they give them a pubescent appearance. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

I found many at Mt. Gretna, Pa., up to 6K in. in diameter. Flesh 
not so firm as L. volemus. Stem equal, rugulose, flattened in old 
specimens. Milk very slightly acrid. 

Better in taste and quality than L. volemus. 

L. lute'olllS Pk. yellowish. PileilS 2-3 in. broad, fleshy, rather 
thin, convex or nearly plane, commonly umbilicately depressed in the 
center and somewhat rugulose, pruinose or subglabrous, buff-color. 
Flesh white, taste mild. Milk copious, flowing easily, white or whitish. 
Gills close, nearly plane, adnate or slightly rounded behind, whitish,

becoming brownish where wounded. Stem I-I-5 m - l n g. 3~5 nnes Lactanus. 
thick, short, equal or tapering downward, solid, but somewhat spongy 
within, colored like the pileus. Spores globose, 7.6/x. broad. 

Dry woods. East Milton, Mass. August. H '. Webster. 

This species is related to Lactarius volemus and L. hygrophoroides, 
but its smaller size and short stem will distinguish it from the former 
and its close gills from the latter. Its paler buff-color will separate it 
from both. Some specimens have a narrow encircling furrow or de- 
pressed zone near the margin and a slightly darker shade of color on 
the margin. The milk constitutes a remarkable feature of the species. 
According to the notes of the collector it is exceedingly copious, rather 
sticky, serous in character with white particles in suspension. It flows 
from many points as soon as the plant is disturbed and it stains the gills. 
It is impossible to collect an unstained specimen, so free is the flow of 
the milk. He, Mr. Webster, says: "I have never succeeded in pick- 
ing a specimen so quietly as to prevent an instant and copious flow of 
its milk." Torrey Bull., Vol. 23, No. 10, 1896. 

Angora, West Philadelphia, August, 1897. I* 1 oak woods. August, 
September. Mcllvaine. 

Quite frequent there. My attention was directed to it by the "nar- 
row encircling furrow or depressed zone near the margin." 

It is of like quality to L. volemus. 

L. Gcerar'dii Pk. Pileus 1.5-4 m - broad, broadly convex plane or 
slightly depressed, dry, generally rugose-wrinkled, with or without a 
small umbo or papilla, dingy-brown, the thin spreading margin some- 
times flexuous lobed or irregular. Gills distant, adnate or decurrent, 
wlute or whitish, the interspaces generally uneven. Stem 12 in. long, 
36 lines thick, subequal, stuffed or hollow, colored like the pileus. 
Spores globose, white, 9-1 1.3^. Milk white, unchangeable, taste mild. 

W 7 oods and open places. Poughkeepsie, W. R. Gerard. Green- 
bush, Sandlake and Croghan, N. Y. July to September. 

This Lactarius closely resembles the Sooty lactarius in color, but dif- 
fers from it in its more distant gills, white spores and constantly mild 
taste. Wounds of the flesh and gills do not become pinkish-red as in 
that plant. From L. hygrophoroides its darker color, hollow stem and 
more globose rougher spores separate it. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. State

Grassy ground and borders of woods. Albany, Greenbush and Sand- 
lake. July and August. 

This plant has almost exactly the color of L. volemus, but differs 
from it in its distant gills, short stem, less copious milk and less globose 
spores. Its flesh is white, with a thickness about equal to the breadth 
of the gills. It is probably edible, but has not yet been tested. The 
typical L. hygrophoroides is described as having the pileus yellowish- 
red and pulverulent, and the gills luteous. It is also represented as a 
small plant; but our specimens, while not fully agreeing with this de- 
scription, approach so closely to it in some of their forms that they 
doubtless belong to the same species. We have therefore extended the 
description so that it may include our plant. In wet weather the pileus 
sometimes becomes funnel-form by the elevation of the margin. Peck, 
38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

growing on borders. 

Its edible qualities are excellent. 

L. mitis'simus Fr. mitis, mild. Pileus 1-3 in. broad, golden-tawny, 
zoneless, fleshy, thin, somewhat rigid, convex, papillate, depressed,

woody or bitterish and unpleasant. Flesh whitish, pinkish or reddish 
gray, odor none. 

Fields, copses, woods, swamps and wet places. July to October. 
Very common. 

This species grows in almost every variety of soil and locality. It 
may be found in showery weather on dry, rocky soil, on bare ground 
or among mosses or fallen leaves. In drier weather it is still plentiful 
in swamps and wet, shaded places, and in sphagnous marshes. It some- 
times grows on decaying wood. It is also as variable as it is common. 
Gillet has described the following varieties : 

Var. cinnamo 'metis . Pileus cinnamon-red, sub-shining. Stem stuffed, 
then hollow; taste mild, becoming slightly acrid or bitter. 

Var. ru'fus. Pileus dull chestnut-red; becoming more concave. 
Stem spongy; taste mild. 

Var. ba'dius. Pileus bay-red, shining as if varnished, with an obtuse 
disk and an inflexed, elegantly crenulate margin. Stem very glabrous, 
hollow. 

The first and second varieties have occurred within our limits. The 
first also has the stem elastic and furnished with a whitish or grayish 
tomentum or strigose villosity at the base, when growing among moss 
in swamps. A form occurred in Sandlake, in which some of the speci-

mens were proliferous. The umbo had developed into a minute pileus. Lactarius. 
With us the prevailing color of the pileus is yellowish-red or cinnamon- 
red. Sometimes the color is almost the same as that of L. volemus 
and L. hygrophoroides, and again it is a tan-color or a bay-red, as in 
L. camphoratus, from which such specimens are scarcely separable, ex- 
cept by their lack of odor. In young plants the pileus usually has a 
moist appearance, which is sometimes retained in maturity. Cordier 
pronounces the species edible, and says that he has tested it several 
times without inconvenience. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

The description of Fries as enlarged and modified by Professor Peck, 
together with that of the varieties placed to the credit of the species by 
Gillet, are given above in full. The species with its ascribed varieties 
is common and well known. Var. ba dins occurs in West Virginia and 
Pennsylvania. They are all edible and vary but little in quality. 
L. subdulcis requires long cooking. 

L. muta'bilis Pk. changeable. Pileus 2-4 in. broad, thin, convex 
or nearly plane, zonate when moist, reddish-brown, the disk and zones 
darker, zoneless when dry, flesh colored like the pileus. Milk sparse, 
white, taste mild. Gills narrow, close, adnate, whitish, with a yellow- 
ish or cream-colored tint when old. Stem 1-2 in. long, 3-5 lines thick, 
equal or tapering upward, stuffed or spongy within, glabrous, colored 
like the pileus. Spores subglobose, rough, 7 .6p- broad.

The species is allied to L. subdulcis, from which the larger size and 
zonate pileus separate it. The zones disappear in the dry plant, and 
this change in the marking of the pileus suggests the specific name. 
They appear to be formed by concentric series of more or less confluent 
spots and are suggestive of such species as L. deliciosus and L. subpur- 
pureus. Peck, 43d Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Veil and consequently the ring ab- 
sent. Stem smooth, stout, rigid, 
brittle, spongy within. Gills rigid, 
fragile, edge thin and acute. Spores 
rounded, often echinulate, white or 
yellowish. On the ground. 

Closely allied to Lactarius but 
separated by the absence of milk. 
The gills of some species exude wa- 
tery drops in moist weather. Owing 

to the similarity of form and the vari- RUSSULA 

able coloring many species are diffi- 
cult to determine ; all the characters should be carefully noted, not 
omitting that of the taste. 

Russulae are readily distinguished by the stout, short, brittle stem and 
the fragility of the pileus and gills. They especially love open woods 
and appear during the summer and fall months, some being found until 
sharp frosts occur. 

It has been claimed by mushroom growers, until within a few years, 
that the spores of the mushroom have to pass through the digestive 
apparatus of the horse before they will germinate. It has been conclu- 
sively demonstrated that such a transmission is not a necessity. It was 
for a long time my opinion following the opinion of others that such 
assistance was necessary. In my many efforts to propagate valuable 
food species of the wild toadstools I endeavored to find the method by 
which the spores were disseminated, and through what digestive medium 
they passed either of insect or animal before germination. Noticing 
that the Russulas were fed upon by a small black beetle, I planted in 
suitable places, not the toadstools, but the beetles found upon them. 
The result was that in several instances I grew the Russulae. My 
experiments, while interesting, are not conclusive, because I later found 
that the same results could be obtained from the toadstool itself when 

185 



Agaricaceee 

Bussuia. planted under its own natural life conditions. It is certain that beetles 
can not be raised by planting Russulae. 

The beetles known as tumble-bugs canthon laevis deposit eggs in 
the center of balls made of animal droppings ; dig a hole in the ground 
and drop them into it. These droppings frequently contain the spores 
of the meadow mushroom. Thus planted with the proper surrounding 
of manure, and at the proper depth, the spores germinate, spread 
mycelium, and a crop of mushrooms is the result. The beetle becomes 
a horticulturist. No wonder the Egyptians, thousands of years ago, 
made it the scarabeus their sacred emblem, and that, 'today, the 
fleur-de-lis of France, so the Rosicrucians say, perpetuates its glorious 
worth and calling. 

Most Russulae are sweet and nutty to the taste ; some are as hot as 
the fiercest of cayenne, but this they lose upon cooking. To this genus 
authors have done especial injustice ; there is not a single species among 
them known to be poisonous, and, where they are not too strong of 
cherry bark and other highly flavored substances, they are all edible; 
most of them are favorites. Where they present no objectionable ap- 
pearance or taste, their caps make most palatable dishes when stewed, 
baked, roasted or escalloped. The time of cooking should be deter- 
mined by the consistency of the variety; some will cook in five minutes, 
others not under thirty. Salt, butter and pepper are the only neces- 
saries as seasoning. 

ANALYSIS OF TRIBES. 

I. COMPACTS (compingo, to put together; compact). Page 187. 

Pileus fleshy throughout, hence the margin is at first bent inward and 
always without striae, without a distinct gluey pellicle (in consequence 
of which the color is not variable, but only changes with age and the 
state of the atmosphere). Flesh compact, firm. Stem solid, fleshy. 
Gills unequal. 

II. FURCATE (furca, a fork. With forked gills). Page 191. 

Pileus compact, firm, covered with a thin, closely adnate pellicle, 
which at length disappears, margin abruptly thin, at first inflexed, then 
spreading, acute, even. Stem at first compact, at length spongy-soft 
within. Gills somewhat forked, with a few shorter ones intermixed, 
commonly attenuated at both ends, thin and normally narrow.

Pileus without a viscid pellicle, absolutely dry, rigid, the cuticle com- Eussuia. 
monly breaking up into flocci or granules. Flesh thick, compact, firm, 
vanishing away short of the margin wliich is straight (never involute), 
soon spreading, and always without strice. Stem solid, at first hard, 
then softer and spongy. Gills, a few dimidiate, others divided, rigid, 
dilated in front and winning out with a very broad, rounded apex , 
whence the margin of the pileus becomes obtuse and is not inflexed. 
Exceedingly handsome, but rather rare. 

IV. HETEROPHYLL/E (R. heterophylla, the typical species 
of the section). Page 198. 

Pileus fleshy, firm, with a thin margin which is at first inflexed, then 
expanded and striate, covered with a thin adnate pellicle. The gills 
consist of many shorter ones mixed with longer ones, along with others 
which are forked. Stem solid, stout, spongy within 

V. FRAGILES (fragilis, fragile or brittle). Page 2OI. 

Pileus more or less fleshy, rigid-fragile, covered with a pellicle which 
is always continuous, and in wet weather viscid and somewhat separ- 
able; margin membranaceous, at first convergent and not involute, in 
full-grown plants commonly sulcate and tubercular. Flesh commonly 
floccose, lax, friable. Stem spongy, at length wholly soft and hollow. 
Gills almost all equal, simple, broadening in front, free in the pileus 
when closed. Several doubtful forms occur. R. Integra is specially fal- 
lacious from the variety of its colors.

Sandy soil in pine woods. Quogue. September. 

This species is related to Russula delica, but is easily distinguished 
by its short stem and crowded gills. The pileus also is not shining and 
the taste is tardily somewhat acrid. From Lactarius exsuccus it is 
separated by the character of the gills and the very short stem which is 
about as broad as it is long. The spores also are larger than in that 
species. The gills in the young plant are sometimes studded with 
drops of water. They are not clearly decurrent. Some of them are 
forked at the base. The pileus is but slightly raised above the surface 
of the ground and is generally soiled by adhering dirt and often marked 
by rusty or brownish stains. The plants grew in old roads in the woods 
where the soil had been trodden and compacted. Peck, 43d Rep. N. Y.

Spores minutely echinulate, white, broadly elliptical, 8-iox6-7/A 
Mas see. 

In appearance it resembles Lactarius vellereus and L. piperatus, but 
its gills do not distill milk or juice. It differs, too, in its mild taste. It 
is related to R. brevipes Pk. 

A large, coarse species, cup-shaped at maturity. I have found it in 
several localities in Massachusetts in July and August. It is of fair 
quality cooked, but much inferior to R. virescens, etc. Macadam. 

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in mixed woods, August 
to October. Mcllvaine. 

Edible. Taste mild. From the juiceless variety of L. vellereus its 
mild taste alone furnishes a separate character. Peck. 

I have eaten it since 1882, but it is not a favorite. Its quality is fair. 

R. sor'dida Pk. dirty. (Plate XLIV, fig. 4, P . 184.) Pileus firm, 
convex, centrally depressed, dry, sordid-white, sometimes clouded with 
brown. Gills close, white, some of them forked. Stem equal, solid, 
concolorous. Spores globose, 7- 5/*' Taste acrid. Flesh changing color 
when wounded, becoming black or bluish-black. 

Plant 4-5 in. high. Pileus 3-5 in. broad. Stem 6-12 lines thick. 

Ground under hemlock trees. Worcester. July. 

It resembles L. piperatus in general appearance. The whole plant 
turns black in drying. Peck, 26th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

It is of better quality than most coarse-grained Russulse. 

FURCA'T.^. 

K. furca'ta Fr. furca, a fork. Pileus 3 in. broad, sometimes 
greenish, sometimes umber-greenish, fleshy, compact, gibbous then 
piano-depressed or infundibuliform, even, smooth, but often sprinkled 
with slightly silky luster, pellicle here and there separable, margin thin, 
at first inflexed, then spreading, always even. Flesh firm, somewhat 
cheesy, white. Stem 2 in. or a little more long, solid, firm, equal or 
attenuated downward, even, white. Gills adnato-decnrrent , rather thick, 
somewhat distant but broad, attenuated at both ends, frequently forked, 
shining white. Fries. 

Spores globose, echinulate, 6-7/4 C.B.P.; 7-8x9^, Massee. 

In woods, and grass under trees. 

The frequently forked gills, from which the species takes its name, 
their being thick and slightly decurrent, help to distinguish it. It is 
quite common in its several varieties. 

Taste mild at first. A slight bitter develops which disappears in 
cooking. It is then of good quality, not equal to R. virescens. Older 
writers marked it poisonous, doubtless for no other cause than its slight 
bitter. I have eaten it freely for fifteen years. 

R. sangui'nea Fr. sanguis, blood. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, blood- 
red or becoming pale round the even, spreading, acute margin, fleshy, 
firm, at first convex, obtuse, then depressed and infundibuliform and 
commonly gibbous in the center, polished, even, moist in damp weather. 
Flesh firm, cheesy, white. Stem stout, spongy-stuffed, at first con- 
tracted at the apex, then equal, slightly striate, white or reddish. Gills 
at first adnate, then truly decurrent, very crowded, very narrow, con- 
nected by veins, fragile, somewhat forked, shining white. Fries. 

Spores 9-iOju, diameter Massee. 

In pine and mixed woods. July to October. 

Color same as R. rubra but differs in its hard cheesy flesh, rigid, 
slightly yellowish gills in age. The gills of R. sanguinea are truly 
decurrent, and pointed in front.

Agaricaceee 

Bussuia. Poisonous. Stevenson. Krapp says he has experienced grave incon- 
veniences from eating it. 

Myself and very many friends eat all fresh inviting Russulae. We do 
not discriminate against a single peppery or acrid species, not even the 
R. emetica which has been severely maligned. In fact the peppery 
Russulae are usually substantial in flesh and choice in substance. 

The opinion of many is that R. sanguinea is one of the best. I have 
eaten it for years. 

R. depal'lens Pers. palleo, to be pale. PileilS 3-4 in. across, pal- 
lid-reddish or inclining to dingy-brown, etc., fleshy, firm, convex, 
then plane, more rarely depressed, but commonly irregularly shaped 
and undulated, even, the thin, adnate pellicle presently changing color, 
especially at the disk, the spreading margin even, but slightly striate 
when old. Flesh white. Stem about i2 in. long, solid, firm, com- 
monly attenuated downward, white, becoming cinereous when old. Gills 
adnexed, broad, crowded, distinct, but commonly forked at the base, 
often with shorter ones intermixed. Inodorous, taste mild. The color 
of the pileus is at first pallid-reddish, or inclining to brownish, then 
whitish or yellowish, opaque in every stage of growth. It approaches 
nearest to the Heterophyllae. Fries. 

In beech woods, pastures, etc. August to September. 

Spores subglobose, echinulate, 7-8p Massee. 

R. depallens somewhat resembles R. heterophylla. Both are edible. 
It is a solitary grower and not common, but when found it occurs in 
good quantity. It belongs to the best class of Russulae. 

R. SUbdepal'lens Pk. sub, de and palleo, to be pale. Pileus fleshy, 
at first convex and striate on the margin, then expanded or centrally 
depressed and tuberculate-striate on the margin, viscid, blood-red or 
purplish red, mottled with yellowish spots, becoming paler or almost 
white with age, often irregular. Flesh fragile, white, becoming cinereous 
with age, reddish under the cuticle, taste mild. Lamellae broad, sub- 
distant, adnate, white or whitish, the interspaces venose. Stem stout, 
solid but spongy within, persistently white. 

Spores white, globose, rough, 8/u. broad.

Leucosporae 

Closely related to Russula depallens, from which it differs in having Russula. 
the margin of the pileus striate at first and more strongly so when ma- 
ture, also in the pileus being spotted at first, the gills more distant, the 
stem persistently white and the spores white. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club. 
Vol. 23, No. 10. October, 1896. 

I do not doubt its edibility. See R. depallens. 

R. ochrophyl'la Pk. ochra, a yellow earth; phyllon, a leaf. Pileus 
2-4 in. broad, firm, convex becoming nearly plane or slightly depressed 
in the center, even or rarely very slightly striate on the margin when 
old, purple or dark purplish red. Flesh white, purplish under the ad- 
nate cuticle, taste mild. Gills entire, a few of them forked at the base, 
subdistant, adnate, at first yellowish, becoming bright ochraceous buff 
when mature, dusted by the spores, the interspaces somewhat venose. 
Stem equal or nearly so, solid or spongy within, reddish or rosy tinted, 
paler than the pileus. Spores bright ochraceous buff, globose-verru- 
culose, IO/A broad. 

The ochery-gilled Russula is a large fine species, but not a common 
one. It differs but little in color and size from the European pungent 
Russula, Russula drimeia, but it is easily distinguished from it by its 
mild taste. 

The cap is dry, convex or a little depressed in the center, purple or 
purplish red, the white flesh purplish under the cuticle, which, however, 
is not easily separable. 

The gills are nearly all entire, extending from the stem to the margin 
of the cap. They are therefore much closer together near the stem than 
at the margin. They are at first yellowish, but a bright ochraceous buff 
when mature. They are then dusted by the similarly colored spores. 

The stem is stout, nearly cylindric, firm but spongy in the center and 
colored like the cap, but generally a little paler. There is a variety in 
which the stem is white and the cap deep red. In other respects it is 
like the typical form. Its name is Russula ochrophylla albipes. 

The ochery-gilled Russula grows in groups under trees, especially 
oak trees, and should be sought in July and August. Peck, 5ist Rep.

Agaricacese 

RI'GID^E. 

Russuia. R. lac'tea Fr. lac, milk. Pileus 2 in. broad, at the first milk-white, 
then tan-white, throughout compactly fleshy , bell-shaped, then convex, 
often excentric, without a pellicle, always dry, at the first even, then 
slightly cracked when dry, margin straight, thin, obtuse, even. Flesh 
compact, white. Stem 1/^-2 in. long, \% in. thick, solid, very com- 
pact, but at length spongy-soft within, equal, even, always white. Gills 
free, very broad, thick, distant, rigid, forked, white. Fries. 

Spores subglobose, echinulate, 7~9/x Massee. 

Closely allied to R. albella Pk. from which it differs in its shorter 
stem, and pileus cracking into areolae, and gills not being entire. 

In mixed woods, in patches, not common. 

Botanic creek, West Philadelphia, Pa., patches, Mcllvaine, 1887. 

Edible and of good flavor. Macadam. 

Raw, it has a raw, rather unpleasant taste and odor, a little like 
some acorns. But its firm, thick flesh, meaty gills and stem, and good 
flavor when well cooked, rank it equal to any. 

R. albella Pk. whitish. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, thin, fragile, dry, 
plane or slightly depressed in the center, even or obscurely striate on 
the margin, commonly white, sometimes tinged with pink or rosy-red, 
especially on the margin. Flesh white, taste mild. Lamellae entire, 
white, becoming dusted by the spores. Stem 1-2 in. long, 3-4 lines 
thick, equal, solid or spongy within, white. 

Spores white, globose, /.6/* broad. 

Dry soil of frondose woods. Port Jefferson. July. 

Closely allied to R. lactea, but differing in its fragile texture, entire 
lamellae, more slender stem, and in the pileus not cracking into areas. 
Peck, 50th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

R. vires'cens Fr. viresco, to be green. (Plate XLIV, fig. 6, p. 
184.) Pileus green, compactly fleshy, globose then expanded, at 
length depressed, often unequal, always dry, not furnished with a pellicle, 
wherefore the flocculose cuticle is broken up into patches or warts, margin 
straight, obtuse, even. Flesh white, not very compact. Stem solid, 
internally spongy, firm, somewhat rivulose, white. Grills free, some-

ones intermixed, white. Fries. 

Taste mild; good, raw. 

Spores scarcely echinulate, almost globular, 6^ W.G.S. Spores 
8 IO/A Mas see; 67.61*- Peck. 

Cap round when young, very hard, then convex or becoming dished, 
sometimes repand. It is without a separable skin, covered with various 
sized areas of mouldy looking patches which are at times distinctly 
cracked. The color varies from a bright bluish-green to grayish-green, 
such shades remind one of mouldy cheese or the shades of Roquefort ; 
again the color may vary in shades of light leather brown, occasionally 
the caps are almost white, opaque in each shade of color. Flesh crisp, 
brittle, thick, white, mild, good raw. Gills and stem as described. 

R. virescens is common in the United States but not generally plenti- 
ful. It is a solitary grower, usually but few are found in a patch. 
Striking in appearance when its green colors are present, and always 
clean looking and inviting. It sometimes attains the size of 5 in. across. 
It is a hot weather Russula and rarely appears before the latter part of 
June, then after rains. 

To eat, it should be in a healthy, fresh condition. All Russulae 
impart a stale flavor if any part of gills or cap is wilting, drying or 
decaying. It requires forty minutes' slow stewing, or it can be dressed 
raw as a salad. Roasted or fried crisp in a hot buttered pan it is at its 
best. It should be well salted. 

R. lep'ida Fr. lepidus, neat, elegant. Pileus 3 in. broad, blood- 
red-rose, becoming pale, whitish especially at the disk, somewhat equally 
fleshy, convex then expanded, scarcely depressed, obtuse, opaque, un- 
polished, with a silky appearance, at length often cracked scaly , margin 
spreading, obtuse, without striae. Stem as much as 3 in. long, often 
I in. thick, even, white or rose-color. Gills rounded behind, rather 
thick, somewhat crowded, often forked, connected by veins, white, often 
red at the edge. 

Taste mild ; wholly compact and firm, but the flesh is cheesy, not 
somewhat clotted. The gills are often red at the edge, chiefly toward 
the margin, on account of the margin of the pileus being continuous 
with the gills. Fries. 

Spores 8- 1 ox6-8/u. Syll.

Agaricaceae 

Kussuia. Frequent. July to October, in mixed woods. 

A common and variable species in size and color, but the cap is 
always some shade of rose-red or lake. The flesh is compact and 
cheesy. The gills sometimes edged with pink as they near the margin. 
Taste mild. 

The crisp flesh of R. lepida requires forty minutes' slow stewing, if 
stewed. It yields a delicate pink shade to the dish. Roasted or cooked 
in a hot buttered pan it is excellent. 

R. ru'bra Fr. ruber, red. Pileus unicolorous, a cinnabar-ver- 
milion, but becoming pale (tan) when old, disk commonly darker, com- 
pact, hard but fragile, convex, then flattened, here and there depressed, 
absolutely dry, without a pellicle, but becoming polished-even, often sinu- 
ously cracked when old, margin spreading, obtuse, even, always per- 
sistent. Flesh white, reddish under the cuticle. Stem 2-3 in. long, 
about I in. thick, solid, even, varying white and red. Gills obtusely 
adnate, somewhat crowded, whitish, then yellowish, with dimidiate and 
forked ones intermixed. 

Very acrid, very hard and rigid, most distinct from all the others of 
this group in the pileus becoming polished-even, although without a pel- 
licle, in the flesh being somewhat clotted, and in the very acrid taste. 
Gills often red at the edge. Fries. 

Spores whitish, Fries; spheroid, 8-io/u. K. 

Krapp says he has experienced grave inconveniences from eating it. 
European authorities mark "poisonous." 

I do not hesitate to cook it either by itself or with other Russulse and 
serve it at my table. It is easier cooked than R. virescens and others 
of the crisp species, and has equal flavor. 

R. Linnse'i Fr. in honor of Linnaeus. Pileus 3-4 in. broad, uni- 
colorous, dark purple, blood-red or bright rose, opaque, not becoming 
pale, everywhere fleshy, rigid, piano-depressed, sometimes spread up- 
ward, even, smooth, dry, without a separable pellicle, margin spreading, 
obtuse, without striae. Flesh thick, spongy-compact, white. Stem I % 
in. and more long, I in. and more thick, stout, firm, but spongy-soft 
within, somewhat ventricose, obsoletely retictdated with fibers, intensely 
blood-red. Gills adnate, somewhat decurrent, rather thick, not crowded,

R. Linnaei is one of our handsomest and best Russulae. European 
authors state its habit to be exactly that of R. emetica, but though I have 
known it intimately for many years I have not been struck with this in 
the American plant. Its large size, its more or less red stem never en- 
tirely white, at times hollow, cavernous, its less solid flesh, habit of grow- 
ing in troops, sometimes parts of rings, flourishing best where the leaf 
mat is heaviest, loving the leaf drift in fence-corners, are well marked 
distinctions. 

When young there is no better Russuia. As it ages the ,stem be- 
comes soft, spongy and should be thrown away. The caps, only, eaten. 

R. oliva'cea Fr. oliva, an olive; olivaceus, the color of an olive. 
Pileus 2-4 in. across, dingy-purple then olivaceous or wholly brownish- 
olivaceous, fleshy, convexo-flattened and depressed, slightly silky and 
squamulose, margin spreading, even. Flesh white, becoming somewhat 
yellow. Stem firm, ventricose, rose-color to pallid, spongy-stuffed 
within. Gills adnexed, wide, yellow, with shorter and forked ones 
intermixed. 

Mild. Near to R. rubra, but certainly distinct in the stem being 
definitely spongy, in the pileus being unpolished, and in the gills being 
soft and brightly colored; corresponding with R. alutacea. Fries.

and is of good flavor. 

HETEROPHYL'L^E. 

R. ves'ca Fr. vesco, to feed. Pileus red- flesh-color, disk darker, 
fleshy, slightly firm, piano-depressed, slightly wrinkled with veins, with 
a viscid pellicle, margin at length spreading. Flesh cheesy, firm, shin- 
ing white. Stem solid, compact, externally rigid, reticulated and 
wrinkled in a peculiar manner, often attenuated at the base, shining 
white. Gills adnate, crowded, thin, shining white, with many unequal 
and forked ones intermixed, but scarcely connected by veins. 

Of middle stature. Taste mild, pleasant. Fries. 

Spores globose, echinulate, white, 9 io/, diameter Massee. 

In mixed woods. Common. August to frost. 

R. vesca is frequent in woods or margins, and under trees in the 
open. It is especially fond of growing in the grass under lone chestnut 
trees. The caps seldom exceed 2.% in. across. 

It is one of the best. 

R. cyanoxan'tha (Schaeff. ) Fr. Gr. blue; Gr. yellow. (From the

pale often yellowish, margin commonly becoming azure-bine or livid 
purple, compact, convex then plane, then depressed or infundibuliform, 
sometimes even, sometimes wrinkled or streaked, viscous, margin 
deflexed then expanded, remotely and slightly striate. Flesh firm,

cavernous within when old, equal, smooth, even, shining white. Gills 
rounded behind, connected by veins, not much crowded, broad, forked 
with shorter ones intermixed, shining white. 

Allied to R. vesca in its mild, pleasant taste and in other respects, 
but constantly different in the color of the pileus, which is very variable, 
whereas in R. vesca it is unchangeable. The peculiar combination of 
colors in the pileus, though very variable, always readily distinguishes 
it. Fries. 

Spores 8-9|u,, cystidia numerous, pointed, Massee; 8-iox6-8/x Sacc. 

In mixed woods. Common. August to October. 

Pronounced one of the best esculent species by all authorities. 

R. heterophyl'la Fr. Gr. differing; Gr. a leaf. (Gills differing 
in length.) Pileus very variable in color, but never becoming reddish 
or purple, fleshy, firm, convexo-plane then depressed, even, polished, 
the very thin pellicle disappearing, margin thin, even or densely but 
slightly striate. Flesh white. Stem solid, firm, somewhat equal, even, 
shining white. Gills reaching the stem in an attenuated form, very nar- 
row, very crowded, forked and dimidiate, shining white. 

Taste always mild, as in R. cyanoxantha, from which it differs in its 
smaller stature, in the pileus being thinner, even, never reddish or pur- 
plish, with a thin closely adnate pellicle, in the stem being firm and solid, 
and in the gills being thin, very narrow, very crowded, etc. The apex 
of the stem is occasionally dilated in the form of a cup, so that the gills 
appear remote. Fries. 

Spores echinulate, 5x7/u- W.G.S.; /-8/i diameter Massee.

Edible, of a sweet nutty flavor. Stevenson. 

R. heterophylla is very common. Its smooth, even pileus, colored in

grubs. Specimens for the table should be young and fresh. Wilted 
specimens are unpleasant. 

R. fffi'tens Fr. fcetens, stinking. Pileus 4-5 in. and more broad, 
dingy yellow, often becoming pale, thinly fleshy, at first bullate, then

thin, rigid- fragile, pallid. Stem 2 in. and more long, %-\ in. thick, 
stout, stuffed then hollow, whitish. Gills adnexed, crowded, connected 
by veins, with very many dimidiate and forked ones intermixed, whitish, 
at the first exuding watery drops. 

Fetid. Taste acrid. Very rigid, most distinct from all others in its 
very heavy empyreumatic odor. In very dry weather the odor is often 
obsolete. The margin is more broadly membranaceous and hence 
marked with longer furrows than in any other species. It differs from 
all the preceding ones in the gills at the first exuding watery drops. 
The gills become obsoletely light yellow, and dingy when bruised. 
Fries. 

Pileus fleshy, with a wide thin margin, hemispherical or convex, then

The verdict is against it. Both smell and taste are usually un- 
pleasant. Cooked it retains its flavor, more closely resembling wild 
cherry bark than anything else. On two occasions I ate enough to con- 
vince me that it was not poisonous. 

R. el'egans Bresad. elegans, pretty. Mild at first, becoming acrid

Russuia. the West Virginia mountains, I began testing this Russula and soon 
found that it was harmless. At least twenty persons ate it in quantity, 
during its season, for four years. Yet, in my many published articles, I 
continued, out of regard for the opinions of others and in excess of 
caution, to warn against all bitter and peppery fungi. But from that 
time until the present I have eaten it, and I have made special effort to 
establish its innocence by getting numbers of my friendly helpers to eat it. 
It was suggested by one of its prosecutors that perhaps I was mis- 
taking another fungus for it. In October, 1898, I sent to Professor 
Peck a lot of the Russula I was eating. He wrote: "It seems to be 
R. emetica as you state. It certainly is hot enough for it."

Common in woods, grassy, mossy places. July to frost. Mcllvaine. 

Named from the furrows of the margin being like the teeth of a comb. 

Both the appearance and smell of this Russula will detect it. The 
peculiar comb-like furrows of its margin, viscid or varnished-looking 
cap, and strong but more spicy smell than cherry-bark are noticeable. 

It is edible, but so strong in flavor that a piece of one will spoil a 
dish if cooked with other kinds. 

R. ochroleu'ca Fr. Gr. pale yellow ; Gr. white. Pileus yellow, 
becoming pale, fleshy, flattened or depressed, polished, with an adnate 
pellicle, the spreading margin becoming even. Stem spongy, stuffed, 
firm, slightly reticulato-wrinkled , white, becoming cinereous. Gills 
rounded behind, united, broad, somewhat equal, white becoming pale. 

Odor obsolete, but pleasant. The pileus is never reddish. It agrees

taste ; it differs however in the stem being slightly recticulato-wrinkled, 
white becoming cinereous, in the adnate pellicle of the pileus, in the 
margin remaining for a long time even (remotely striate, but not tuber- 
cular, only when old), and in the gills being rounded behind and be- 
coming pale. The color of the pileus is constant. The gills remain 
free and do not exude drops. Fries.

Spores papillose, 7//, W.G.S., 8x9/1, Massee. 

Frequent in woods. July to October. 

Not as common as R. emetica, yet frequently found, usually solitary, 
at times gregarious. It is quite peppery, but loses pepperiness in cook- 
ing. Myself and others have frequently eaten it. 

R. ci'trina Gillet citrina, citron colored. Mild. Pileus 2-3 in. 

across, slightly fleshy at the disk, margin thin; convex then more or 
less expanded and slightly depressed, rather viscid when moist, smooth, 
slightly wrinkled at the margin when old, bright lemon-yellow, color 
usually uniform, sometimes paler at the margin, occasionally with a 
greenish tint, center of pileus at length becoming pale-ochraceous ; pel- 
licle separable. Gills slightly decurrent, broadest a short distance from 
the margin, and gradually becoming narrower towards the base, forked 
at the base and also sometimes near the middle, white, \% lines deep 
at broadest part. Stem 23 in. long, about 4 lines thick, equal or 
slightly narrowed at the base, slightly wrinkled, straight or very slightly 
waved, solid. 

Spores subglobose, echinulate, 8/* diameter. 

In woods. 

Known by the clear lemon-yellow or citron-colored pileus and the 
persistently white gills and stem. The taste is mild at first, but be- 
comes slightly acrid if kept in the mouth for a short time. Massee. 

R. citrina can hardly be classed among the acrid species. The taste 
is slightly of cherry-bark and disappears in cooking. It is usually found 
in patches which contain ten to twenty individuals. It is a species of 
fair quality.

Very acrid. Smaller and more fragile than the rest of the group, 
directly changing color. The color is variable, often opaque, typically 
flesh-color, when changed in color white externally and internally, often 
with reddish spots. Among varieties of color is to be noted a livid 
flesh-colored form, with the disk becoming fuscous. 

It is not easy to define it from fragile forms of R. emetica, but the 
gills are much more crowded, thinner, and often slightly eroded at the 
edge, ventricose; the pileus thinner and more lax, etc. Stevenson.

with the spores. 

Taste mild, often astringent. The most changeable of all species, 
especially in the color of the pileus which is typically red, but at the 
same time inclining to azure-blue, bay-brown, olivaceous, etc. Some- 
times the gills are sterile and remain white. Fries.

It is difficult to separate R. integra from R. alutacea. The spores 
usually show upon the gills as pale dull yellow powder. It is of equal 
excellence. 

R. decolo'rans Fr. de and coloro, to color. Pileus 3-5 in. broad, 
color various, at first orange-red, then light yellow and becoming pale,

white, but becoming somewhat cinereous when broken, and more or less 
variegated with black spots when old. Stem elongated, 35 in., cylin- 
drical, solid, but spongy within, often wrinkled-striate , white then be- 
coming cinereous especially within. Gills adnexed, often in pairs, thin, 
crowded, fragile, white then yellowish. 

Taste mild. Colors changeable according to a fixed rule, but not 
variable. The gills are not ochraceous-pulverulent as in R. integra, nor 
shining and pure yellow as in R. aurata, etc. Fries.

This species closely resembles pale forms of R. furcata, from which 
it is separated by the absence of any silky micor and by the yellowish 
color and elliptical shape of the spores and by the yellowish hue of the 
lamellae. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Pileus sometimes depressed in center, very viscid when wet. 

A troop of this Russula upon brown wood mat is a pretty sight. Its 
rich and brightly-colored cap attracts the eye from a distance. The 
yellow edge of its gills is the distinctive mark of the species. 

The smell is pleasant, the taste slightly of cherry bark. 

Cooked it is one of the best Russulse.

R. alutacea is easily recognized among Russulae by its mild taste and 
broad yellow gills. In young specimens one sometimes has to look at 
the gills at an angle to detect the yellow. It is quite common but a 
solitary grower. It is everywhere eaten as a favorite. Only fresh 
plants yield a good flavor. When the stem is soft, it should be thrown 
^way.

Var. rose'ipes Sec., given by Massee, has been retained as a distinct 
species by Professor Peck, Rep. 51, and is described in place. R. 
pusilla Pk., 5<Dth Rep., is closely allied to it. 

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina. Common 
in woods and under trees in short grass. July to September. Mcllvaine. 

This little Russula is ubiquitous. It does not amount to much when 
other fungi are plenty, because of its very thin cap, but it thrives in all 
sorts of summer weather. When its companions are scarce or parched 
R. puellaris is gladly gathered by the mycophagist, its numbers making 
up for its lightness and lack of flavor. 

R. pusilla Pk. little. Pileus very thin, nearly plane or slightly 
and umbilicately depressed in the center, glabrous, slightly striate on 
the margin, red, sometimes a little darker in the center, the thin pellicle 
separable. Flesh white, taste mild. Lamellae broad for the size of the 
plant, subventricose, subdistant, adnate or slightly rounded behind, 
white, becoming yellowish-ochraceous in drying. Stem short, soft, 
solid or spongy within, white.

Pileus scarcely I in. broad. Stem 6-12 lines long, 2-3 lines thick. 

Bare ground in thin woods. Port Jefferson. July. 

The coloring matter of the pileus may be rubbed upon paper and 
produce on it red stains if the surface is previously moistened with water 
or dilute alcohol. This is one of the smallest Russulas known to me. 
The pileus was less than an inch broad and the stem less than an inch 
long in all the specimens seen by me. The species is closely allied to 
R. puellaris, and especially resembles the variety intensior in color. It 
differs in its smaller size, even or but slightly striate margin, broad 
lamellae and in the stem or flesh not becoming yellowish spotted where 
touched. Peck, Soth Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

or when old obsoletely striate at the margin. Flesh white. Stem ^ 
in. long, 3-4 lines thick, stuffed then hollow, soft, fragile, equal, even, 
white, never reddish. Gills somewhat free, connected by veins, crowded, 
narrow, all equal, ochraceous-egg-yellow. 

Always small, very regular, taste mild. When young the pileus is 
always of a beautiful yellow. Fries. 

Spores yellow, echinulate, 8/x, W.G.S.; globose, rough, 6-7/* C.B.P.; .

Allied to R. vitellina, but differs in having the margin of the cap 
even, and but little odor. 

The plant I have so referred has the gills at first white and the stem 
yellow like the pileus; it may be a new species. In beech woods, 
Morgan; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in mixed woods, 
often under beeches, August to November, Mcllvaine. 

The plants I have found have white gills when young (few species 
have not), but rapidly become yellow. The stem is usually white when 
young, and sometimes remains so, but often becomes more or less 
yellow. 

It is a pretty species. The flavor is not as strong as in some species, 
but is delicate. 

R. nauseo'sa Fr. Pileus variable in color, typically purplish at the 
disk, then livid, but becoming pale and often whitish, laxly fleshy, thin, 
at first piano-gibbous, then depressed, viscid in wet weather, furrowed 
and somewhat tubercular at the somewhat membranaceous margin. 
Flesh soft, white. Stem short, about I in. long, 4 lines thick, spongy- 
stuffed, slightly striate, white. Gills adnexed, ventricose, somewhat 
distant, here and there with a few shorter ones intermixed, light yellow 
then dingy ochraceous. 

The taste is mild, but also nauseous, as the odor often is. The habit 
is that of R. nitida, of the same color of pileus, but differing in the color 
of the gills. Fries.

The odor and taste of R. nauseosa are misnamed, therefore the plant. 
They are heavy at times, when the plant is wet or old, as is the case 
with R. fcetens, but they are always of cherry bark. Both odor and 
taste disappear in cooking. The species is as good as any Russula of 
its texture. 

H. vitelli'na Fr. vitellus, yolk of egg. Pileus i in. broad, uni- 
colorous, light yellow then wholly pallid, somewhat membranaceous, at 
length tuberculoso-striate , somewhat dry, disk very small, slightly fleshy. 
Stem thin, scarcely exceeding I in. long, 2 lines thick, equal. Gills 
separating-free, equal, distant, rather thick, connected by veins, saffron- 
yellow. 

Pretty, very fragile, strong-smelling, mild. Fries. 

Spores 7-8/u, diameter Massee. 

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, August to October. In 
pine and mixed woods, July to October. Not common in number. 

This pretty species has a cherry-bark taste and smell like R. fcetens, 
though not so offensively heavy. It is not poisonous. A small piece 
of it will affect a whole dish of other Russulae. 

R. chamseleonti'na Fr. changing color like a chamaeleon. Pileus 
1-2 in. broad, thinly fleshy, soon flattened, sometimes oblique .with a 
thin, separable, viscid pellicle, which is at first flesh-color, then pres- 
ently changing color, becoming yellow at the disk and at length wholly 
yellow, margin even, then slightly striate. Stem as much as 3 in. long, 
but thin, somewhat hollow, slightly striate, white. Gills more or less 
adnexed, thin, crowded, equal, narrow, somewhat forked, light-yellow- 
ochraceous. 

Mild, inodorous, very fragile. Pileus rosy blood-red, purplish lilac, 
etc. Sometimes even at the first yellowish at the disk. Fries. 

Spores globose, ochraceous, 7-8/* diameter Massee. 

In pine and in mixed woods. August to October. Mcllvaine. 

The change in color of the cap which gives name to this species is 
not remarkable. Most species of Russulae are sensitive to light. An 
otherwise highly colored cap will be almost white when a leaf adheres 
to it. If in youth it grows under dense shade it will be very much 

212 



Leucosporae 

lighter than if where light is generous, and will remain so. If in grow- 
ing it thrusts itself out of shadow, its color will change and it will 
deepen. The apparent rarity of R. chamasleontina I think due to the 
close observation necessary to detect its changes in color, which, as I 
have found it, are by no means constant. It is quite plentiful in the 
pines of southern New Jersey, and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., it is frequently 
found. 

It is a good esculent species. 





Agaricaceee 

CANTHAREL'LUS Adans. 
Gr. a vase, a cup. 

Canthareiius. Hymenophore continuous with the stem, descending unchanged into

In Canthareiius the gills vein-like and gen- 
erally thick with an obtuse edge are entirely 
different from those of all the preceding 
genera. In those they are thin, and distinct 
from the pileus and from each other. In 

Hygrophorus the gills are frequently thick, 
CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS. 

but the edge is always sharp. The species 

of Craterellus are funnel-shaped, resembling some of those in Cantha- 
reiius, but are distinguished by their lack of evident gills. 

Monograph New York Species of Canthareiius, Peck, Bull. 1887. 

The members of this genus are few, but they are choice. Of them 
is the Canthareiius cibarius, of which Trattinik quaintly says : "Not 
only this same fungus never did any one harm, but might even restore 
the dead." 

The writer first made its acquaintance when among the West Virginia 
mountains in 1881. The golden patches of single and clustered 
cibarius, fragrant as ripened apricots, tufting the short grass or mossy 
ground under beeches, oaks and like-growing trees, through which the 
sunlight filtered generously, were so tempting, that he determined there 
must be luxury, even in death, from such toadstools. 

Experiments made by the writer in West Virginia where the species 
grows luxuriantly and is of much higher flavor than any he has found 
elsewhere, prove that it is easy to transplant within congenial habitats, 
either by the mycelium or spores. Nature, there, resorts to washing 
masses of leaves containing the propagating parts of the fungus along 
the depressions of the water-sheds, and it is found growing plentifully 
where the wind has drifted forest leaves against trees, brush, and fence- 
corners. 

Other species of the genus do not, as a rule, grow so plentifully, 
neither are they of equal excellence, but several of them are equal to

There is such a marked difference between the excellence of the genus 
in West Virginia and other localities, that it is possible C. aurantiacus 
may be noxious elsewhere, but the writer has not found it so ; and it 
would be an astonishing contradiction of Nature's ways if it was. 

Stevenson says: "It (C. cibarius) must have four hours slow cook- 
ing." The writer has found thirty minutes to be sufficient; and it will 
fry in butter as quickly as any other fungus.

CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS. 



Reported from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific and from Columbia 
river to Louisiana. June to Sep- 
tember. 

Wherever grown C. cibarius is 
one of the best. In European 
countries it is highly rated, and 
is expensive. Its mode of growth 
varies with its plentifulness. In 
the West Virginia mountains large 
patches of it closely cover the 
ground. Clusters weighing % 
pound are frequent. 

When shredded, or cut across 
the fibers, slow cooking for half 
an hour is sufficient, if the plants 
are fresh. If gathered for some> 
hours, they should be soaked for 
a time. 



C. mi'nor Pk. Pileus fleshy, thin, convex then expanded and de- 
pressed, egg-yellow. Grills very narrow, distant, sparingly branched,

Grows in the West Virginia mountains, along with C. cibarius, and

flavor to those found there. I usu'ally cooked them together and thus 
got quantity well flavored.

Var. pallidus Pk. Pileus and gills pale yellow or whitish yellow. 

Stevenson says of the English species, "Unpleasant, reckoned pois- 
onous." The writer's acquaintance with C. aurantiacus has been prin- 
cipally confined to West Virginia. There its taste is mild, scent but lit- 
tle, flavor not distinguishable from eastern C. Cibarius. There it is per- 
fectly safe and wholesome ; neither have the writer and his friends any 
reason for condemning it. 

C. umbona'tllS Fr. having an umbo. Pileus I in. and more broad, 
ashy-blackish, slightly fleshy, convex when young, umbonate, at length 
depressed, even, dry, flocculoso-stiky on the surface, shining brightly 
especially under a lens. Flesh soft, white, often becoming red when 
wounded. Stem 3 in. long, about 4 lines thick, stuffed, equal, elastic, 
villous at the base, ash-colored, but paler than the pileus. Gills decur- 
rent, thin, tense and straight, crowded, repeatedly divided by pairs, 
shining-white . 

Odor and taste scarcely notable. Gregarious. Among the taller 
mosses the stem is longer. Often overlooked from its habit being that 
of an agaric. It varies with the pileus squamulose and blackish. 

In woods. April to August. Fries. 

The rather prominent gills of this small species are likely to confuse 
those not familiar with its variance from the genuine type. Reddish 
tinge to flesh not noticed in the American species. The writer has 
gathered it in several states and enjoyed it for many years. 

C. rosel'lus Pk. rosy. Pileus thin, funnel-shaped, regular, glabrous, 
pale pinkish-red. Flesh white. Gills narrow, close, dichotomous, deeply 
decurrent, whitish, tinged with pink. Stem equal, slender, solid, 
subglabrous, often flexuous, colored like the pileus. Spores minute, 
broadly elliptical, 3.5x2.5^. 

Pileus 4-8 lines broad. Stem about I in. long, scarcely I line thick.

CANTHARELLUS ROSELLUS. 
Natural size. 



Mossy ground in groves of balsam. 
North Elba. September. This small 
species belongs to the section Agar- 
icoides, and is apparently closely al- 
lied to C. albidus, from which its 
smaller size and different color dis- 
tinguish it. The pileus is sometimes 
deeply umbilicate. Peck, 42d Rep. 
N. Y. State Bot. 

Frequent in pine woods of New 
Jersey, near Haddonfield, where the 
plant is sturdier than described. 
Though small it grows gregarious 
and in troops from which appetizing 
quantities can be gathered. 

It makes a pretty dish of pinkish 
hue and one of rare excellence. 



C. lutes'cens Bull. yellowish. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 9, p. 508.) 
PileilS thin, fleshy, convex, umbilicate, brownish-floccose, yellowish. 
Gills very distant, sparingly branched, arcuate-decurrent, pale ochrace-

Height 2-3 in., breadth of PileilS 8-15 lines. 

Mossy ground in woods. Catskill and Adirondack mountains, also 
Sandlake. August to October. 

This is regarded by some as a variety of A. tubaeformis. Peck, 23d 
Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

In mixed and scrub-pine woods near Haddonfield, N. J. ; mixed 
woods Angora and Kingsessing, Philadelphia. 

Perhaps constancy to C. cibarius has influenced the writer in favor of 
members of its family, and accounts for the gusto in "Fine" set opposite 
his notes to the present species. Nevertheless such is his opinion.

ty. July. 

This interesting species is related 
to the C. floccosus, both by its short 
stem and its abundantly anastomosing folds. The two species should 
be separated from the others and constitute a distinct section. The 
flesh in C. brevipes is soft and whitish, and the folds are generally thin- 
ner than in C. floccosus. Peck, 33d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Plentiful in West Virginia mountains in 1884, growing in patches. 
Found in mixed woods near Cheltenham, Pa., and at Springton, Pa., 
1887.

Agaricaceae 



CanthareUus. In West Virginia it is prolific and rivals the C. cibarius in excellence. 
The flesh is softer, not so fibrous, and cooks more readily. 

In that locality there is a marked difference between C. brevipes and 
C. floccosus. The latter is much longer, and markedly resembles the 
large end of a gold lined cornet. Like the C. cibarius it is not of as 
good quality in eastern states.

MARASMIUS OREADES. 
About one-half natural size. 



Pileus regular, thin, tough and pliant, 
somewhat distant, variously at- 
tached or free, with an acute 
entire edge. Stem cartilaginous or 
horny, continuous with the pileus 
but of different texture. Not pu- 
trescent but drying up with lack 
of moisture, reviving and assuming 
the original form with the advent 
of rain. This character distin- 
guishes Marasmius from all other 
genera of Agaricaceae. 

Its nearer relations are Collybia 
and Mycena. 

Fries says that all Agaricaceae 
having the smell of garlic are found 
in this genus. On the ground, but generally on wood or leaves. 

Professor Peck reports over forty species of this genus found in New 
York state. Several not found in New York are reported from other 
states. The writer has found a few such species in Pennsylvania and 
West Virginia. Many untried species will probably prove to be edible ; 
the majority are too small to be of food value. M. urens, reported pois- 
onous, and M. peronatus, heretofore considered poisonous, have been 
found by the writer to be edible. Several species not described herein 
have been tested for edibility to a limited extent only. 

In this genus occurs the famed M. oreades, the Mousseron of France, 
the Champignon and Scotch bonnet of England, the Fairy-ring mush- 
room of America.

M. peronatus is the wood-cousin of M. oreades. It is still reputed 
poisonous by all writers upon the subject, though M. C. Cooke gives it 
the benefit of a doubt. The name is given because of the base of the 
stem being densely covered with short hairs or a woolly down, and is 
thus easily recognized. It is common in woods, among decaying 
leaves, especially of the oak, from May until after frosts. It is usually 
solitary, but a few individuals are sometimes clustered. It is quite 
peppery to the taste, but pleasantly so. I have repeatedly eaten it, 
as have my friends. It loses its acridity in cooking, and though the 
caps are tougher than M. oreades, they make a highly flavored and 
delicious dish. Collectors should carefully test it for themselves.

and in rings, but can be found from May until after frost. If one knows Marasmius. 
where the rings are to be found M. oreades can be gathered when 
shriveled, and are quite as good, after soaking, as when fresh. 

M. oreades must be sought for where the grass is luxuriant. It hides 
among it. It is well worthy of the search. Raw, fresh or shriveled, 
it is sweet, nutty, succulent when eaten; stewed well it is delicious. 
Though tough its consistency is agreeable. The most delicate stomachs 
can digest it. The writer saved the life of a lovely woman by feeding 
her upon it when nothing else could be retained ; and of another, by 
feeding Coprinus micaceus, after a dangerous operation. He introduced 
these species, together with a few others, into a large hospital in Phila- 
delphia, where they were used with marked beneficial effect, and such 
use is now widespread. 

When dried, by exposure to the air or sun, it can be kept indefinitely, 
neither losing its aroma or flavor, which it graciously imparts to soups 
or any other dish. 

Collybia dryophila, Stropharia semi-globata, and Naucoria semi- 
orbicularis are sometimes found growing with it. These species are 
delicious and harmless. 

Lafayette B. Mendel in the Am. Jour, of Physiology, March, 1898,

hard and firm, continuous with the 
flesh of the pileus. 
Growing on wood. 
Spores somewhat round, even, 
white. 

Distinguished from other coriace- 
ous genera by its serrated and torn 
gills. 

"The genera Lentinus and Len- 
zites are found in every region of the 
world ; their principal center, how- 
ever, is in hot countries, where they 
attain a splendid development. On 

the contrary, toward the north they rapidly decrease in number." 
Fungi. Cooke and Berkeley. 

In habitat and mode of growth Lentinus closely resembles Pleurotus, 
and parallel genera with colored spores. When young the species are 
inviting, and when well cooked are meal-giving. They are not delica- 
cies, but substantials. They dry well. Grated they make soups, and 
give their pleasant flavor to any dish.

Professor Peck writes to me: "This plant, by reason of its rather 
tough substance, has commonly been referred to Lentinus, under the 
name L. Lecomtei Schw., but this reference is scarcely satisfactory to 
me, since the edge of the lamellae is scarcely at all serrate as required 
by that genus. It seems to me it would go better under the genus

times called Lentinus strigosus, but I do not think the two are distinct 
species, however distinct they may be in form." February 26, 1894. 

Like all Lentinus the present species is rather tough, yet chopped 
into small pieces, well cooked and seasoned, it is quite equal to P. 
ostreatus and many others of high renown.

Lentinus lepideus is a sort of commercial traveler. It is common 
wherever railroads are. It is partial to oak ties and its mycelium is in- 
jurious to them. It is found upon pine and other timbers. The writer 
has collected large clusters of it from oak sawdust. The European 
plant is noted as "almost always solitary." In the United States it is 
seldom so. It is noted as growing in damp, dark places, but it loves 
the sim. 

As a food it is about on a par with P. ulmarius, not as tough, but 
harder when old. It is a reliable species from spring until late autumn, 
is persistent and dries well. It is neat, handsome, prolific. When 
young it makes a good dish, and when old can be used to advantage in 
soups.

Leucosporse 

L. COChlea'tllS Fr. cochlea, a snail. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, flesh- 
color, but becoming pale, somewhat tan, fleshy-pliant, thin, com- 
monly excentric, imbricated, very unequal, somewhat lobed or con- 
torted, sometimes plane, sometimes funnel-shaped-umbilicate, but not 
pervious, smooth. Stem solid, firm, sometimes central, most frequently 
excentric, sometimes wholly lateral, always snlcate, smooth, flesh-colored 
upward, reddish-brown downward. Gills decurrent, crowded, serrated, 
white-flesh-color. Fries. 

Pliant, tough, flaccid, very changeable in form, sometimes solitary, 
sometimes cespitose, imbricated, growing into each other. From very 
small forms which are commonly solitary, with the stem and pileus 
scarcely I in', it ranges to 3 in. 

On stumps. Frequent. August to October. 

According to Fries the odor is weak, of anise; but it is generally 
strong and very pleasant. Stevenson. 

Spores nearly globular, 4/u. diameter Morgan; spheroid or ellipsoid- 
spheroid, uniguttate, 4 6/* K.; almost globular, 4/x. W.G.S. 

The dense clusters of all sized members are usually plenty in favored 
localities. It is inviting in appearance, taste and spicy odor. It re- 
tains a suspicion of the latter when cooked which gives the dish a flavor 
pleasant to many. It must be young to be tender. When dry like 
others of its kind it can be grated and used in many ways. 

L. Un'dei'WOOdii Pk. Pileus fleshy, tough, convex or nearly plane, 
the glabrous surface cracking into areola-like scales which are indistinct 
or wanting toward the margin, whitish or slightly tinged with buff or 
pale ochraceous. Flesh white. Gills moderately close, decurrent, 
slightly connecting or anastomosing at the base, somewhat notched on 
the edge, whitish, becoming discolored in drying. Stem stout, hard, 
solid, eccentric, squamose, colored like the pileus. Spores oblong, 
13-15x5-6.5^. 

Plant cespitose. Pileus 3-6 in. broad. Stem 1-5-3 m - l n g, about 
I in. thick. 

This differs from L. magnus in its cespitose habit, eccentric stem, . 
longer spores, less distinctly areolate-squamose pileus and in its habitat. 
The gills are connected at the base very much like those of Pleurotus 
ostreatus. Peck, Torr. Bull. Vol. 23, No. 10.

Agaricacese 

Lentinus, The writer first met with it in North Carolina, near Washington, on 
oaks and railroad timbers, and in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. It 
attains quite a size, grows singly and in clusters. Its clean, cake-like 
appearance is attractive. Cooked it ranks with P. ulmarius, L. lepideus, 
and Panus strigosus.

ANALYSIS OF SPECIES. 

* Stem excentric. 
** Stem lateral. 
* Stem absent. Pileus resupinate or dimidiate. 

Species of this genus are among our most observable fungi. Their 
settlements are frequent on decaying trees, stumps, branches, on fences, 
cut timber, etc. Most of them are small, but their coriaceous build pre- 
vents their shrinking in cooking. Most species have a pleasant fari- 
naceous taste and odor, which they yield, together with a gummy sub- 
stance, to soups and gravies. 

Tasting a small piece will immediately tell, if the species is not 
known, whether it is edible or of the styptic kind.

often lobed, cinnamon-color becoming pale, at length more or less 
scaly. Flesh thin. Gills narrow, forming decurrent lines on the stem, 
somewhat branched ; pinkish-white then pale-ochraceous. Stem about 
?a in. long, 3-4 lines thick, solid, unequal, pale, base downy. Massee. 

On trunks of beech, poplar, etc. 

Often imbricated and more or less grown together. Allied to Panus 
torulosus, but distinguished by the much thinner pileus, more expanded 
and excentric, also dimidiate, flaccid, cinnamon becoming pale, but the 
form not constant. Stem about ,'2 in. long, 4 lines thick, often com- 
pressed, downy at the base. Pileus 2-4 in. broad, scaly when old. 
Gills decurrent in long, parallel lines, not at all resembling those of 
Pleurotus ostreatus, which anastomose behind, but frequently unequally 
branched, at first whitish or pale flesh-color, then wood-color, crisped 
when dry. Fries. 

Always known by its shell-like form and its tough substance. 

Sent to the writer by Mr. E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J. September, 
1898. 

The appearance of scales upon the pileus was scarcely noticeable. 
Taste pleasant. The fungus is tough when old, but yields an excellent 
gravy. 

P. torulo'sus Fr. a tuft of hair. (Plate LIV, p. 232.) Pileus 2-3 
in. broad, somewhat flesh-color, but varying reddish-livid and becoming 
violet, entire, but very excentric, fleshy, somewhat compact when young, 
plano-infundibuliform, even, smooth. Flesh pallid. Stem short, com- 
monly i in., solid, oblique, tough, firm, commonly with gray, but often 
violaceous down. Gills decurrent, somewhat distant, simple, separate 
behind, reddish then tan-color. 

Very changeable in form, at first fleshy-pliant, at length coriaceous. 
In the covering of the stem it approaches Paxillus atro-tomentosus, but 
there is no affinity between them. Fries.

Paaus. P. laevis B. and C. light. Pileus 3 in. broad, orbicular, slightly 
depressed, white, clothed in the center with long, intricate, rather deli- 
cate hairs, which are shorter and more matted toward the inflected mar- 
gin ; substance rather thin. Stem 3 in. high, > in. thick, attenuated 
upward, generally excentric, sometimes lateral, not rooting, solid, hairy 
below like the margin of the pileus. Gills rather broad, entire, decur- 
rent, but not to a great degree, the interstices even above, behind 
clothed with the same coat as the top of the stem. Spores white. 

On oak and hickory trunks. 

A most distinct species, remarkable for its great lightness when dry 
and the long villous but not compressed or compound flocci of the 
pileus. Sometimes the center of the pileus becomes quite smooth when 
old. 

One of the prettiest of fungi. The markings upon the white margin 
are more precise than those of the finest bee comb. One does not tire 
looking at the work of Nature's geometrician. It is not plentiful, but is 
of useful size. It has good flavor and cooks quite tender.

A remarkably handsome fungus. A specimen taken from a cluster 
growing upon an apple tree measured 10 in. across. Its creamy white- 
ness, and short hairy stem make it unmistakable among other tree- 
fungi. 

When very young it is edible, but soon becomes woody. Even when 
aged it yields a well flavored gravy.

margin. Stem lateral, very short, or entirely absent, and attached by 
a downy base. Gills radiating from the point of attachment; narrowed 
behind, lanceolate, honey-colored, margin entire, rigid, scarcely crowded, 
shorter ones intermixed. Spores subglobose, smooth, 5/u, diameter. 

On trunks and branches. 

Pileus about i in. broad, often in imbricated tufts. It is doubtful 
whether this is not a distinct species from the type described by Fries. 
Cooke and Massee. 

Panus albido-tomentosus is given by Cooke and Massee as a variety 
of Panus farinaceus. The writer decides to give it place as a species. 

It has been sent to me by Mr. H. I. Miller, from Terre Haute, Ind., 
by Dr. E. L. Gushing, Albion, N. Y., Miss Madeleine Le Moyne, 
Washington, Pa. I have found it in West Virginia, New Jersey and 
many parts of Pennsylvania. It is plentiful in patches upon branches 
and boles of deciduous trees. Long, slow cooking makes it tender. 
It makes a luscious gravy after thirty minutes' stewing. 

* Stem absent, pileus resupinate or dimidiate. 

P. betuli'nilS Pk. bctula, birch. Pileus thin, suborbicular or dimi-

Gregarious, cespitose, remarkable for its astringent taste. The pileus 
sometimes has a funnel-shaped appearance with lobes all around. 

On stumps, etc. Common. August to February. 

Reckoned poisonous. Stevenson. 

Spores obovoid-spheroid, 2-3x1-2^ K.; 3x4^ W.G.S. 

Plentiful and general. The markings upon the cap in moist weather 
are sometimes exquisitely regular. 

The immediate and lasting unpleasantness of this fungus to mouth 
and throat, whether cooked or raw, will cancel all desire to eat of it 
forevermore. A nibble will detect it. It is reckoned poisonous, and 
may be. No one but a determined suicide would resort to it. Dr. 
Lambotte asserts that it is a violent purgative.

as inedible, a few of our best American edibles are found in it notably 
Pluteus cervinus.

Growing in woods and on rich mold, rotten wood and damp ground, 
hence often found in hot-houses and gardens. V. Loveiana Berk, is 
parasitic on Clitocybe nebularis. 

There are thirteen species reported from different parts of the United 
States. Most of them grow upon wood. Two species have previously 
been reported as edible, to which I have added V. Taylori, tested by 
myself. 

One species, V. gloiocephala, is upon the authority of Letellier, 
given as poisonous. It is found in several parts of the United States, 
but no comment has been made upon its edibility. I have not seen it. 
A careful study of its botanic characters is urged. It should be re- 
garded as poisonous until its reputation is cleared up, as it probably 
will be.

PLU'TEUS Fr. 

{Pluteus, a shed. From the conical shape of the pileus.) 

Stem fleshy, distinct from the pileus. Gills free, rounded behind 
(never emarginate), at first cohering, white, then colored by the spores. 

Generally growing on or near trunks of trees. 

Resembling Voivaria in all respects but the volva. Spores rosy. 

Several of the genus are edible. Pluteus cervinus is one of our earli- 
est, persistent, plentiful, delicious food species- The caps of those 
tested are tender, easily cooked and best fried. 

ANALYSIS OF SPECIES. 

*Cuticle of the pileus separating into fibrils or down, which at length 
disappear. 

**Pileus frosted with atoms, somewhat powdery. 
***Pileus naked, smooth. 

* Cuticle of pileus fibrillose, etc. 

P. cervi'nus Schaeff. cervus, a deer. (Plate LXI, fig. I, p. 242.) 
Pileus fleshy, at first campanulate, then convex or expanded, even, 
glabrous, generally becoming fibrillose or slightly floccose-villose on the 
disk, occasionally cracked, variable in color. LamellSB broad, some- 
what ventricose, at first whitish, then flesh-colored. Stem equal or 
slightly tapering upward, firm, solid, fibrillose or subglabrous, variable 
in color. Spores broadly elliptical, 6.5-8x5-6.5^.

Agaricaceae 

piuteus. Plant 2-6 in. high. Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 3-6 lines thick. 

The typical form has the pileus and stem of a dingy or brown color 
and adorned with blackish fibrils, but specimens occur with the pileus 
white, yellowish, cinereous, grayish-brown or blackish-brown. I have 
never seen it of a true cervine color. It is sometimes quite glabrous 
and smooth to the touch and in wet weather it is even slightly viscid. 
It also occurs somewhat floccose-villose on the disk, and the disk, 
though usually plane or obtuse, is occasionally slightly prominent or 
subumbonate. The form with the surface of the pileus longitudinally 
rimose or chinky is probably due to meteorological conditions. The 
gills, though at first crowded, become more lax with the expansion of 
the pileus. They are generally a little broader toward the marginal 
than toward the inner extremity. Their tendency to deliquesce is often 
shown by their wetting the paper on which the pileus has been placed 
for the purpose of catching the spores. The stem is usually somewhat 
fibrous and striated but forms occur in which it is even and glabrous. 
When growing from the sides of stumps and prostrate trunks it is apt to 
be curved. Two forms deserve varietal distinction. 

Var. afbns. Pileus and stem white or whitish. 

Var. al'bipes. Pileus cinereous yellowish or brown. Stem white or 
whitish, destitute of blackish fibrils. 

In Europe there are three or four forms which have been designated 
as species under the names of A. rigens, A. patricius, A. eximius and 
A. petasatus, but Fries gives them as varieties or subspecies of A. cer- 
vinus, though admitting that they are easily distinguished. None of 
these have occurred in our state. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Var. visco'sus. The normal character of the cuticle of the species is 
slightly viscid in wet weather, but the specimens we collected and photo- 
graphed were exceedingly viscid. They also differed from the normal 
form in their lighter color, flesh much thicker at the disk and thin at the 
margins, and cuticle not appearing fibrillose. It is close to petasatus, 
but differs, however, in its narrower gills and in having no striae. It is 
a good variety if it is not a good species. Lloyd, Myc. Notes.

Its free gills should distinguish it from any Entoloma, though both 
have pink spores and eventually pink gills. Among the earliest of

then knows the toadstool season to be truly opened. 

Caps only are tender. The stems are edible, but they are not of the 
same consistency as the caps, therefore will not cook with them. Fried 
in a buttered pan or broiled, they are exceedingly toothsome. 

In October, 1898, a beautiful variety (see Plate LXI, fig. 2, p. ), 

occurred which I had not previously seen. It was sent by me to Pro- 
fessor Peck. The plants grew in large clusters from rotting, refuse 
straw in the ruin of a stable ; the white, cottony mycelium running 
upon and through the straw. The solid stems of some were straight, 
others curved, ranging from 26 in. long, the taller ones tapering from 
base to spindling apex, the shorter ones decidedly bulbous and ending 
abruptly. They were twisted and delicately marked. These markings 
break up into dark thread-like fibrils, leaving the stem striate and satin- 
glossy. PileilS from 24 in. across, dark Vandyke-brown when young, 
lighter in age, streaked, glossy. Gills at first white, tardily changing 
to light salmon color, broad, ventricose, free. 

Taste and smell pleasant of almonds. Good, delicious. 

Professor Peck wrote of it: "It has the general appearance of 
Pluteus cervinus, but these specimens seem to depart from the usual 
form of growing in clusters from the ground, and in having an almond 
flavor. Without knowing more about it I would scarcely feel justified 
in separating it from such a variable species. As Fries sometimes re- 
marks concerning variable species : Perhaps several species are con- 
cealed under the one name, but a pretty full and accurate knowledge of 
them is desirable if one is to split them up." 

This is excellent judgment. While I believe the above to be a dis- 
tinct species, the disposition to make new species of varieties is regret- 
table in many botanists.

At times the caps are a deep sepia-brown. It is readily distinguished 
from P. cervinus by the wrinkled, downy disk of the cap and the gills 
having dark-brown edges. Smell rather strong. Professor Peck says 
he has not seen it with the margin fimbriate. Neither have I, though 
this is prominent in the European species.

Piuteus. Plant 1.5-3 m - high. PileuS 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 lines thick. 

Decaying wood and prostrate trunks in woods. Hilly and mountain- 
ous districts. June to September. 

The species is closely related to P. cervinus and P. umbrosus, but is 
readily distinguished from them by the peculiar vesture of the pileus 
and stem. The granules are so minute and so close that they form a 
sort of plush on the pileus, more dense on the disk and radiating 
wrinkles than elsewhere. The clothing of the stem is finer, and has a 
velvety-pubescent appearance, but in some instances it breaks up into 
small scales or squamules. The color of the pileus and stem is usually 
some shade of yellow or brown, but occasionally a grayish hue pre- 
dominates. The darker color of the granules imparts a dingy or smoky 
tinge to the general color. The disk is often darker than the rest of 
the pileus. Peck, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

when dry, yellow or brown. Lamellae close, broad, rounded behind, 
ventricose, whitish or yellowish, then flesh-colored. Stem slender, 
glabrous, hollow, equal or slightly thickened at the base, yellow or yel- 
lowish white, with a white mycelium. Spores subglobose or broadly

In our plant small young specimens sometimes have the stem solid,

ENTOLO'MA Fr. 

Gr. within ; Gr. a fringe. 
(Probably referring to the innate character of the pseudo veil.) 

Entoioma. Pileus rather fleshy, margin incurved, without a distinct veil. Stem 
fleshy or fibrous, soft, sometimes waxy, continuous with the flesh of the 
pileus. Gills sinuate, adnexed, often separating from the stem. Spores 
rosy, elliptical, smooth or subglobose and coarsely warted. 

Corresponding in structure with Tricholoma, Hebeloma and Hypho- 
loma; separated from other rosy-spored genera by the sinuate gills. 

About twenty species of Entoioma are given in the states ; of them 
seventeen are described by Professor Peck, as found in New York. I 
have not found a single species in sufficient quantity to test its edibility. 

Two of the European species, E. sinuata Fr. and E. livida Bull., are 
reputed to be very poisonous, producing headache, dizziness, vomiting, 
etc. Worth ington Smith ate % oz., which nearly proved fatal. 

Professor Peck reports a species, E. grande Pk., which he considers 
suspicious. 

Even the reported poisonous species have a pleasant odor correspond- 
ing to those of the esculent species. This makes them the more de- 
ceptive and dangerous. The pinkish or flesh-colored spores and gills 
distinguish Entoioma from Hebeloma, which has brown spores, and 
Tricholoma, which has white. Pluteus, which has pink spores and gills, 
is readily separated from it. 

Great caution should be observed. Entolomas should be thrown away 
or carefully tested.

Some of the best of edible kinds are within this genus; a few are un- 
pleasant raw, none poisonous. 

Most authors follow Fries in the arrangement of the species, dividing 
them into two groups, the Orcelli, distinguished by deeply decurrent 
gills and an irregular, scarcely hygrophanous pileus, with the margin at 
first flocculose; and Sericelli, distinguished by adnate or slightly de- 
current gills and a regular silky or hygrophanous-silky pileus with a 
naked margin. This arrangement is not strictly applicable to some of 
our species. C. abortivus, C. erythrosporus and C. Noveaboracensis 
have the gills deeply decurrent in some individuals, adnate or slightly 
decurrent in others, and therefore the same species might be sought in 
both groups. For this reason the primary grouping of our species has 
been made to depend upon the variation in the spore colors. By far 
the greater number of our species appear to be peculiar to this country, 
only two of them occurring also in Europe.

faces. This form equals its original. 

C. prunulus has a strong smell of fresh meal. It is a delicious species. 

Stew. It is one of the very best in patties, croquettes, etc.

fleshy, soft, plane or slightly depressed, 
often irregular, even when young, 
slightly silky, somewhat viscid when 
moist, white or yellowish- white. Flesh 
white, taste and odor farinaceous. Gills 
deeply decurrent, close, whitish then 
flesh-colored. Stem short, solid, floc- 
culose, often eccentric, thickened above, 
white. Spores elliptical, a-iox5//.. 

Generally a little smaller than the 
preceding species, softer and more irre- 
gular, but so closely allied that by some 
it is considered a mere variety of it. It 
is said to be edible and of delicate flavor. 
It occurs in wet weather in pastures and 
open places. Peck, 42 d Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 8-1 8 lines long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Pastures. Saratoga county. 

The species is related to C. prunulus from which it is distinct by its 
shorter, paler spores, its glabrous pileus cracked in areas on the disk 
and tinged with red or yellowish and by its paler gills. From C. pseudo- 
orcella it differs in its glabrous pileus with no silky luster and in its 
closer gills. Its odor is obsolete but it has a farinaceous flavor. It is 
probably esculent, but has not been found in sufficient quantity to afford 
a test of qualities. Peck, 42d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

C. unitinct'lis Pk. one-colored. Pileus thin, submembranaceous , 
flexible, convex or nearly plane, centrally depressed or umbilicate, 
glabrous, subshining, often concentrically rivulose, grayish or grayish- 
brown. Flesh whitish or grayish-white, odor obsolete, taste mild. 
Gills narrow, moderately close, adnate or slightly decurrent, colored like 
the pileus. Stem slender, straight or flexuous, subtenacious, equal, 
slightly pruinose, grayish-brown, with a close white myceloid tomentum 
at the base and white root-like fibers of mycelium permeating the soil. 
Spores elliptical, 7.5x5/4.

Our species has been found to be edible, but its flavor is scarcely as 
agreeable as that of some other species. Peck, 42d Rep. N. Y. State 
Bot. 

It requires longer cooking than C. prunulus, and is then quite equal 
in excellence. 

The fungus is so named because of the abortive form of it frequently 
found associated with it. This is faithfully portrayed on Plate LXIII. 
This is in every way similar to the aborted forms of C. prunulus and 
Armillaria mellea. 

Both forms plentiful near Philadelphia. The undeveloped masses 
are also similar to those of C. prunulus. 

The abortive form is a superior edible to the original.

Woods and pastures. Adirondack mountains, Albany and Rensselaer 
counties. August to October. 

The plant is gregarious or cespitose. Sometimes, especially in the 
variety, it grows in lines or arcs of circles. The margin is often undu- 
lated, and in the variety it is, when fresh and moist, clothed with a film 
of interwoven webby white fibrils which give it a peculiar appearance, 
and if the spore characters are neglected it might be mistaken for Clito- 
cybe phyllophila. The disk is often tinged with reddish-yellow or rusty 
hues when moist, and its rivulose character is then more distinct. A 
farinaceous odor is generally present, especially in the broken or bruised 
plant, but its taste is bitter and unpleasant. Sometimes bruises of the 
fresh plant manifest a tendency to assume a smoky-brown or blackish 
color. The base of the stem is sometimes clothed with a white myceli- 
oid tomentum. Peck, 42d Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

The species of this genus were formerly distributed among the Pleu- 
(Plate LXX.) roti and Crepidoti, which they re- 

semble in all respects except the 
color of the spores. The genus at 
first was made to include species with 
lilac-colored as well as pink spores, 
but Professor Fries limited it to spe- 
cies with pink spores. In this sense 
we have taken it. The spores in 
some species are even, in others 
rough or angulated. The stem is 
either entirely wanting or is very 
short and inconspicuous, a character 
indicated by the generic name. The 
pileus often rests upon its back and 
is attached by a point when young, 

but it becomes turned backward with age. The species are few and in- 
frequent. All inhabit decaying wood.

C. ni'dlllans Pers. nidus, a nest. Pileus 1-3 in. broad, stemless, ciaudopus. 
attached by the pileus or rarely narrowed behind into a short stem-like 
base, caps often overlapping one another, suborbicular or kidney-shaped, 
downy , somewhat pointed-hairy or scaly-hairy toward the margin, yellow 
or buff color, the margin at first turned inward. Lamellae rather broad, 
moderately close or subdistant, orange-yellow. Spores even, slightly 
curved, 6-S//, long, about half as broad, delicate pink. 

Decaying wood. Sandlake. Catskill and Adirondack mountains. 
Autumn. 

This fungus was placed by Fries among the Pleuroti, and in this he 
has been followed by most authors. But the spores have a delicate 
pink color closely resembling that of the young lamellae of the common 
mushroom, Agaricus campestris. We have, therefore, placed it among 
the Claudopodes, where Fries himself has suggested it should be placed 
if removed at all from Pleurotus. Our plant has sometimes been referred 
to Panus dorsalis Bosc., but with the description of that species it does 
not well agree. The tawny-color, spoon-shaped pileus, pale floccose 
scales, short lateral stem and decurrent lamellae ascribed to that species 
are not well shown by our plant. The substance of the pileus, though 
rather tenacious and persistent, can scarcely be called leathery. The 
flesh is white or pale yellow. The hairy down of the pileus is often 
matted in small tufts and intermingled with coarse hairs, especially 
toward the margin. This gives a scaly or pointed-hairy appearance. 
The color of the pileus is often paler toward the base than it is on the 
margin. Peck, 39th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Mt. Gretna, Pa., November, 1898, decaying stumps. Mcllvaine. 

An autumnal species growing upon wood. Not common. 

The light yellow tomentosity of the cap arranges itself into shapes as 
fascinating as crystals of snow. 

Taste pleasant, mild. Texture more solid than P. ostreatus, con- 
sequently tougher. It is edible but not desirable. Must be chopped 
fine and cooked well.

Series III. OCHRO'SPOILffi (Dermini). Spores brown. 

Ochrosporae, third in color series, ranges in spore color from dull 
ochraceous, through bright ocher, to rusty orange and ferruginous or 
iron-rust. The various shades will tax even a color expert. 

There are no species in the series corresponding to Amanitae. In 
Acetabularia there is a cup-like volva ; in Pholiota there is a distinct 
interwoven ring on the stem ; in Cortinarius the secondary veil is like a 
cobweb, and may form an imperfect zone around the stem, or hang as 
fibers from the margin of the cap; Pluteolus exactly resembles Pluteus. 

There are many edible species of good quality in the series. None 
are known to be poisonous. The substance,. as a rule, is tougher than 
in most of the preceding genera, and in many instances has a strong 
woody flavor. Several species are late growers, and are among the best 
of fungi. Notably in Pholiota. 



ACETABULA'BIA Berk. 
Acctabulum, a vinegar-cup. From the cup-like volva.

Pileus more or less fleshy. Gills adnate, with or without a decur- Phoiiota.

Spores sepia-brown, bright yellowish-brown or light red. 

Generally on wood, sometimes on the ground in damp moss, fre- 
quently densely cespitose. Some of the species are large and bright 
colored. Distinguished from all other genera of the brown-spored 
series by the possession of a distinct ring. In Cortinarius the veil and 
ring are web-like. 

Stevenson notes in his description of the genus: "None are to be 
commended as edible." My investigation shows that there are several 
delicious species, notably P. squarrosa and subsquarrosa. Their late- 
ness and plentifulness make them valuable food fungi. I have nothing 
but praise for the entire genus.

This fungus occurs sparingly in rich woods near Boston. It is much 
esteemed in Germany, and eagerly sought by the common people, who 
call it familiarly the "Zigeuner" (Gypsy). Boston Myc. Club Bull. 
1896. 

I have found this species in but one place on the south hill of the 
great Chester valley, Pa., where it grows plentifully in woods. The 
taste raw was slightly acrid, but when cooked this disappeared. Many 
ate of the species and enjoyed it.

The Early Phoiiota is a small but 
variable species. From other similarly 
colored species that appear in grassy 
ground early in the season, the collar on 
the stem will generally distinguish it. 
Its cap is usually convex when young 
but nearly flat in the mature plant. It 

is rather pale in color but not a clear white, being tinted with yellow or 
pale tan-colored hues. The gills are whitish when the cap first opens, 
but they soon change to a rusty-brown hue in consequence of the ripen- 
ing of the spores. They are excavated at the inner extremity and 
slightly attached to the stem. They are ventricose when the cap is 
fully expanded. The stem is rather slender, nearly or quite straight 
and soon smooth and hollow. It is pale or whitish, and usually furnished 
with a small collar. Sometimes the collar is slight and disappears with 
age and sometimes the fragments of the veil remain attached to the 
margin of the cap leaving nothing for a collar. 

The plants usually grow in grassy ground, lawns and gardens, and 
appear from May to July. 

Var. minor Batt. is a small form having the cap only about I in. 
broad and the remnants of the veil adherent to the margin of the cap. 
It is represented by figures 6 to 12.

Edible. Curtis. 

The American species, as I have repeatedly found it, is not so large as 
given in the European description, and the habitat is more closely con- 
fined to the trunks of standing trees and stumps not much decayed. It 
is a showy species, to be seen from afar off, especially after the leaves 
fall. Taste when young, raw, is sweet, mealy; when mature, like stale 
lard. 

Cooked, the caps are of good substance and flavor. One of the very 
best. 

P. squarrosoi'des Pk. squarrosus, scurfy; eidos, form. Pileiis 
firm, convex, viscid when moist, at first densely covered by erect papil-

revealing the whitish color and viscid character of the pileus. Lamellse 
close, emarginate, at first whitish, then pallid or dull cinnamon color. 
Stem equal, firm, stuffed, rough with thick squarrose scales, white 
above the thick floccose ring, pallid or tawny below. Spores minute, 
elliptical, 5 X 4A*- 

Densely cespitose, 3-6 in. high. Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 3-5

This is evidently closely related to A. squarrosus, with which it has, 
perhaps, been confused, but its different colors and viscid pileus appear 
to warrant its separation. Peck, 3ist Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Occurred in large clusters on sugar maples at Eagle's Mere in Octo- 
ber, and on stumps at Mt. Gretna. It very closely resembles P. squar- 
rosa. Its caps are of the very best.

P. SUbsquarro'sa Fr. sub, under; squarrosus, scurfy. (Plate LXXI#, Phoiiota. 
tig. 4, p. 270.) PileilS 2 in. and more broad, brown rust-color, with 
darker, adpressed, floccose scales, fleshy, convex, obtuse or gibbous, 
viscid. Stem 3 in. long, 4-5 lines thick, stuffed (often hollow when 
old), equal, yel!ow-rust-color, clothed with darker scales which are 
adpressed, or spreading only at the apex, not rough, furnished with an 
annular zone at the apex, becoming yellow-rust-color within. Grills 
deeply sinuate, emarginate, almost free, arcuate, crowded, at first pale 
then dingy yellow. 

Spores rust-color. The pileus is viscid, but not glutinous like that 
of A. adiposus. It holds a doubtful place between A. aurivellus and 
A. squarrosus, departing from both, however, in the gills being at the 
first yellow; and from A. squarrosus, to wrjich it is more like, in the 
gills being emarginato-free, not decurrent. Somewhat cespitose. Al- 
most inodorous. Fries.

Not previously reported. 

The maple trees in West Philadelphia frequently show large clusters 
of it up to twenty feet from ground ; to be seen from afar after the leaves 
have fallen. Our American species differs somewhat from the European. 
American species : 

PileilS 13 in. across, fleshy, convex, very viscid, rich brownish- 
yellow, covered with darker adpressed floccose scales. Flesh slightly 
yellow. Gills white when very young slightly emarginate, adnexed, 
crowded, K in. broad, brown. Stem 2-3 in. long, 1 A in. thick, equal 
or tapering toward base, stuffed, then hollow, covered with squamose 
scales as far up as the slight ring, smooth above ring. Ring mem- 
branaceous, slight. 

Spores rust-color. 

The species is variable and differs greatly in youth and maturity. 

The caps, fried in hot buttered pan, are unexcelled. 

Equally fine in croquettes and patties.

PHOLIOTA ADIPOSA. 
About natural size. 



Pileus fleshy, firm, at first hem- 
ispherical or subconical, then convex, 
very viscid or glutinous when moist, 
scaly, yellow. Flesh whitish. Gills 
close, adnate, yellowish becoming 
rust-color with age. Stem equal or 
slightly thickened at the base, scaly 
below the slight radiating floccose 
ring, solid or stuffed, yellow, gener- 
ally rust-color at the base. Spores 
elliptical, 7.6x5^. 

The Fat pholiota is a showy spe- 
cies. Its tufted mode of growth, 
rather large size, yellow color and 
rusty-brown scales make it a notice- 
able object. The stem is somewhat 
and the cap very viscid when moist, 
and this viscidity when dry gives it a shining appearance. The scales 
of the cap become erect or reflexed and sometimes appear blackish at 
the tips. They sometimes disappear with age. The flesh is firm and 
white or whitish. The gills when young are yellow or pale-yellow, but 
when mature they assume a ferruginous or rusty color like that of the 
spores. The stem is similar in color to the cap, but paler or nearly 
white at the top and usually reddish-brown or rusty-brown at the base. 
The collar is slight and often scarcely noticeable in mature specimens. 

The Cap is 2-4 in. broad, the Stem 2-4 in. long and 4-6 lines thick. 
The plants commonly grow in tufts on stumps or dead trunks of de- 
ciduous trees in or near woods. They may be found from September 
to November. It is well to peel the caps before cooking. This species 
is not classed as edible by European authors, but I find its flavor agree- 
able and its substance digestible and harmless. Peck, 49th Rep. N. Y.

as are also the crowded rough scales. Ring membranaceous, entire, 
not far removed from the pileus, of the same color. Gills adnate and 
without a tooth, somewhat thin, crowded, at the first bright sulpliur- 
yellow, at length rust-color, edge quite entire. 

Pileus by no means hygrophanous. It is distinguished from all others 
by the sulphur-yellow scales on the tawny pileus. Forming small clusters. 
Inodorous. The ring is sometimes only indicated by an annular zone.

The scales of the pileus are sometimes arranged in concentric circles.

Specimens, clustered, found by me on railroad ties at Haddonfield,

without tinge of purple ; skin minutely cracked, showing the white flesh 
in the interstices; stem I 2 in. long, 34 lines thick, slightly thickened 
upward, pale orange, solid, squamulose; ring floccose ; taste when raw, 
slightly bitter. These were sent to Professor Peck who wrote: "Ap- 
pears to be a form of P. ornella Pk., but it differs some in color, being 
more of a green hue than of purple or olivaceous. It is pretty and I 
would like to know more about it before deciding on it fully." 

I have not since found it. Very palatable when cooked.

It varies much, and is deceptive on account of the vanishing veil. In 
hedges there is a very small cespitose form with the pileus only }% in.

never has a distinct pellicle, by the 

veil which is continuous and homogeneous with the fibrils of the pileus, 
and by the rusty-brown spores. All grow on the ground. They are

The specimens which I have referred to this species appear to be a

dimensions of the spores have been taken from the American plant. I 
do not find them given by any European author. Peck, 46th Rep.

In October, 1897, P. reticulatus grew in large quantities on a fallow 
lot close by the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. The lot was 
thickly covered with tall heavy-stemmed weeds, a mat of which, from 
the year before was present. The reticulations upon the cap are intri-

Agaricacese 

Fiammuia. The genus Flammula is not represented in our territory by a large 
number of species. It is, nevertheless, not very sharply distinct from 
the allied genera, Pholiota, Hebeloma and Naucoria. From Pholiota 
it is especially separated by the slight development of the veil which is 
merely fibrillose or entirely wanting. It never forms a persistent mem- 
branous collar on the stem. From Hebeloma it may be distinguished 
by the absence of a sinus at or near the inner extremity of the gills, by 
the absence of white particles or mealiness from the upper part of the 
stem and by the brighter or more distinctly rusty or ochraceous color of 
the spores. From Naucoria the fleshy or fibrously fleshy stem affords 
the most available distinguishing character. The genus belongs to the 
Ochrosporae or ochraceous-spored series, but the spores of its species 
vary in color from ochraceous or tawny-ochraceous to rust-color or 
brownish-rust color. The three things to be especially kept in mind in 
order to recognize the species are the color of the spores, the adnate 
or decurrent but not clearly sinuate gills and the fleshy or fibrously 
fleshy stem without a membranous ring. 

Our species are mostly of medium size, none being very small and 
one only meriting the appellation large. They appear chiefly in late 
summer or in autumn and grow in woods or in wooded regions either 
on the ground or more often on decaying wood. Many are gregarious 
or cespitose in their mode of growth. Some have a bitterish or unpleas- 
ant flavor and none of our species has yet been classed as edible. Fries 
arranged the species in five groups, of which the names and more 
prominent characters are here given. Pec&,$oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

The few species which the writer has found to be edible, and the two 
new species found by him, were tested after the publication of the above. 
Several of the species found are not mentioned herein for the reason that 
a sufficient quantity was not obtained to make certain their quality as a 
food. The bitterness, as far as observed, with which most of the species 
are tainted disappears in cooking.

Gregarious on partly burned anthracite coal, Mt. Gretna, Pa. Sep- 
tember. C. Mcllvaine. 

The species is peculiar in its color and habitat. In the dried speci- 
men the gills have assumed a brown color with no ochraceous tint. 
Mr. Mcllvaine remarks that it is an edible species, dries well, and is 
excellent when cooked. Its relationship is with F. anomala Pk., but it 
is a larger plant with darker color and a different habitat. Peck, Bull. 
Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 26, F. 1899. 

It grows on partly burned anthracite coal, not buried, as printed in 
the Torrey Bulletin. The mycelium completely involves the pieces of 
coal, holding them tightly in its meshes. Patches of it were strictly 
limited to the size of the ash-pile containing the partly burned coal. 
Quite fifty were found. 

As stated, it is edible, and it is of remarkably fine substance for a 
Fiammuia. 

LU'BRICI. Pileus viscid, etc. 

F. edlllis Pk. eatable. Pileus fleshy, convex, obtuse, glabrous, 
moist, brown, grayish-brown or yellowish-brown, sometimes rimose. 
Flesh whitish. Lamellae rather broad, close, decurrent, bright tan 
color, becoming brownish-rusty. Stems cespitose, equal, stuffed or hol- 
low, brown. Spores subelliptical, 13x5-6/4. 

Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Grassy ground, along pavements, in gutters and by the side of wooden 
frames of hotbeds. Haddonfield, N. J. October. C. Mcllvaine. 

The collector of this species informs me that the flavor of the fresh 
plant is slightly bitter, but that this disappears in cooking and the fungus 
furnishes a very good and tender article of food. Successive crops con- 
tinued to appear for a month. In the dried specimens the stem is 
striate. Peck, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3. 

This new species appears annually in the same place. I have not 
found it elsewhere. It is meaty and excellent.

Gregarious and in loose tufts, not plentiful. It is a pretty plant, 
usually of a bright yellow, sometimes darker at the center of cap. 
Traces of an evanescent fibrillose ring are occasionally found or the fibrils 
adorn the margin of the cap. The gills next to the stem are either 
rounded, attached or slightly decurrent. 

Raw the taste is slightly bitter. This disappears in long cooking.

F. flavida is a frequent species, gregarious and tufted on decaying 
vood, either standing, fallen, or as roots in the ground. The texture 
and substance are good. The slight bitter when raw disappears in 
cooking. The caps, only, are tender.

(almost conico-attenuated) upward, whitish with adpressed silky-hairy 
down (becoming tawny when the down is rubbed off) slightly striate, 
with white hairs at the base, and somewhat mealy at the apex. Veil

and Galera because they corre- 
spond with Omphalia and Eccilia. 
The pileus is, however, distinctly 
umbilicate or depressed in only a 
few of them ; the others are placed 
here on account of their somewhat 
decurrent gills, which are broadest behind and triangular.

in minute flakes to the edge of the 
young pileus. Stem cartilaginous, 
hollow or with a spongy stuffing. 
Growing on wood or on the ground, 
sometimes rooted. Spores various 
shades of brown, dull or bright. 

Naucoria corresponds with Colly- 
bia, Leptonia and Psilocybe; from 
the latter it is distinguished by the 
spore colors and from Galera in the 
brown-spored series by the margin 
of the pileus being at- first incurved. 
"The spores are rust-color, or 
brownish rust-color. The color of 
the pileus is some shade of yellow. 
The stem is not distinctly ringed, 
but sometimes a slight spore-stained 
band marks the place of the obsolete 
ring." Peck, 23d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

The members of this genus are with two or three exceptions very 
common, and common over the land. The greater number grow on 
the ground among grass; a few grow upon decaying wood. The stems 
are not of the same texture as the cap and frequently will not cook 
tender. The caps, however, are, of all species tested, tender and of 
good flavor. Species of the genus are among the first to appear in spring, 
and well reward the enterprising mycophagist for his early tramps.

semi-orbicularis and N. pediades, both of which are edible, that it is 
here given, that it may be recognized by students on the Pacific coast 
or wherever it occurs.

Ochrosporse 

GALE'KA Fr. 

Galerus, a cap. 

PileilS more or less membranaceous, conical or oval, then expanded, Gaiera. 
striate, margin at the first straight, then adpressed to the stem. Gills 
not decurrent. Stem somewhat cartilaginous, continuous with the 
pileus, but differing in texture, tubular. Veil none or fibrillose. Spores 
tawny-ochraceous. 

Slender, fragile, generally growing on the ground. 

Gaiera corresponds with Mycena, Nolanea, Psathyra and Psathyrella, 
which are distinguished by their spore colors. In the brown-spored 
series Naucoria is separated by the margin of the pileus being at first 
incurved, and Tubaria by the decurrent gills. 

The genus is composed of small species, but many grow in clusters, 
and are of a consistency which decreases but little in quick cooking. 
Those tested are delicate in texture and flavor. 

G. lateri'tia Fr. later, a brick. Pileus i in. high, pale yellowish 
when moist, ochraceous when dry, hygrophanous, membranaceous, 
acorn-sJtaped then bell-shaped, obtuse, even, smooth, slightly and densely 
striate at the margin when moist. Stem 3 in. and more long, i line 
thick, tubular, attenuated upward, tense and straight, even, but white- 
pruincse, whitish. Gills adnexed in the top of the cone, hence appear- 
ing as if free, ascending, very narrow, crowded, cinnamon. 

Gills almost adpressed to the stem, almost pendulous. Remarkably 
analogous with A. ovalis, but easily distinguished by the linear gills 
and the absence of a veil ; very fragile. Fries. 

Spores 1 1x5/1 W.P.; i I-I2X5-6/A Masses. 

West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania. On dung 
and rich pastures. June to frost. Mcllvaine. 

The narrow conical cap, distinctly striate, distinguishes this species 
from G. tenera. In quality there is no difference. It is a well-flavored, 
delicate species.

16.5x8-10/1 Peck. 

Var. pilosella (Agaricus pilosellus Pers.), has both pileus and stem 
clothed with a minute erect pubescence when moist. A form is some- 
times found in which the center of the pileus is brown or blackish-brown. 
Peck, 46th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Var. obscu'rior Pk. A notable form of this species was found grow- 
ing in an old stable of an abandoned lumber camp. The plants were 
large, the pileus in some being more than an inch broad, the stems 
were 3-6 in. long and the color was rust-colored as in G. ovalis, to 
which the plants might be referred but for the large spores. Essex 
county. July. I have labeled the specimens variety obscurior. Peck, 
5oth Rep. 

Haddonfield, N. J. ; Chester county; West Philadelphia, Pa. ; West 
Virginia. In rich pastures, on lawns, dung in woods. Common. June

low, slightly striate at the top, sprinkled with white mealy particles, 
white or yellowish. Spores ovate or subelliptical, brownish-rust-color, 
13x8^. 

Pileus 6-12 lines broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 1-1.5 l mes thick. 

Damp vegetable mold in woods. Tompkins county. July. 

This species is well marked by the pale-yellow color of the pileus and 
its plicate striations which are very distinct even in the dried specimens. 
They extend half way to the disk or more. When dry the pileus is seen 
to be sprinkled with shining atoms as in some other species of the same 
genus. Occasionally the yellow cuticle cracks into squamules or small 
scales. Peck, 46th Rep. 

Trenton, N.J., Sterling; Haddonfield, N. J. ; Pennsylvania. Among 
chips in woods and on woods ground. Mcllvaine. 

This species is frequent, and when plentiful well worth gathering. It 
has a more woody flavor than other Gaiera, but is tasty.

Agaricacese 

Gaiera. Though small it makes up in quantity when found. The stems are 
not as tender as the caps. Quality good. 




BOLBI'TIUS Fr. 

Gr. cow's dung. 

Boibitius. Pileus membranaceous. Gills adnexed or free, membranaceous, soft, 
salmon-color or rusty, dissolving (not dripping as in Coprinus), pow- 
dered with the rusty spores. Stem central; universal veil absent, 
partial veil often obsolete. 

Very delicate and fragile, remarkable among the Ochrosporae for the 
gills dissolving into mucus, and in this respect analogous with Coprinus 
among the Melanosporae, and Hiatula amongst the Leucosporae. Grow- 
ing on dung or amongst grass where dung abounds. 

A small but very natural genus, with the vegetative portion like 
Coprinus and the fructification resembling Cortinarius, hence occupying 
an intermediate position between these two genera. Fries. 

B. Bol'toni Fr. after Bolton. Pileus rather fleshy, viscid, at first 
even, then with the membranaceous margin sulcate, disk darker, subde- 
pressed. Stem attenuated, yellowish, at first floccose from the remains 
of the fugacious veil. Gills subadnate, yellow then livid-brown. Fries.

CREPIDO'TUS Fr. 

Gr. a slipper. 

Crepidotus. Veil wanting or not manifest. Pileus eccentric, lateral or resupinate. 



(Plate LXXXI.) 




Spores rust-color. 

The Crepidoti correspond in shape 
and habit to the smaller Pleuroti and 
the Claudopodes, but they are dis- 
tinguished from both by the rust-color 
of their spores. These are globose 
in several species, in others they are 
elliptical. In some there is a depres- 
sion on one side which gives them a 
naviculoid character and causes the 
spore to appear slightly curved when 
viewed in a certain position. In con- 
sequence of the similarity of several 
of our species, the character of the spores is of much importance in 
their identification, and it is unfortunate that European mycologists 
have so generally neglected to give the spore characters in their 
descriptions of these fungi. In most of the species the pileus is at first 
resupinate, but it generally becomes reflexed as it enlarges. It is gen- 
erally sessile or attached by a mass of white fibrils or tomentum. For 
this reason it is usually somewhat tomentose or villose about the point 
of attachment, even in species that are otherwise glabrous. In several 
species the pileus is moist or hygrophanous and then the thin margin is 
commonly striatulate. This character is attributed to but one of the

dozen or more European species. Their mode of growth is usually Crepidotus. 

gregarious or somewhat loosely imbricated, in consequence of which 

the pileus, which in most species is white or yellowish, is often stained 

by the spores, and then it has a rusty, stained or squalid appearance. 

The species occur especially on old stumps, prostrate trunks and soft 

much decayed wood in damp, shaded places. Peck, 39th Rep. N. Y. 

State Bot. 

C. ful'vo-tomento'sus Pk. tawny-tomentose. Pileus %-2 in. 

broad, scattered or gregarious, suborbicular, kidney-shaped or dimidi- 
ate, sessile or attached by a short, white-villose tubercle or rudimentary 
stem, hygrophanous, watery-brown and sometimes striatulate on the 
margin when moist, whitish, yellowish or pale ochraceous when dry, 
adorned with small, tawny, hairy or tomentose scales. Lamellae broad, 
subventricose, moderately close, rounded behind, radiating from a lateral 
or eccentric white villose spot, whitish becoming brownish-ferruginous. 
Spores elliptical often uninucleate, 8-10x5-6/4. 

Decaying wood of poplar, maple, etc. Common. June to October. 

A pretty species, corresponding in some respects to the European C. 
calolepis, but much larger and with tawny, instead of reddish scales. 
The cuticle is separable and is tenacious, though it has a hyaline gelatin- 
ous appearance. The pileus is subpersistent, and specimens dried in 
their place of growth are not rare. Peck, 39th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Haddonfield, N. J. ; Angora, West Philadelphia. On decaying 
hickory. Mcllvaine. 

Substance fair. Taste strong but pleasant.

Agaricaceee 

CORTINA'RIUS Fr. 

Cortina, a veil or curtain. 

Cortinarius. Veil resembling the consistency of a cob-web, superficial, distinct 
from the cuticle of the pileus. Flesh of pileus and stem continuous. 
Gills persistent, dry, changing color, powdered with the spores. Trama 
fibrillose. Spores globose or oblong, somewhat ochraceous on white 
paper. Fries. 

This genus is not easily confounded with any other, the cob-webby 
veil stretched from stem to pileus in the young plant not being found in 
other fungi. This must be looked for only in youth, as from its tender 
character it soon breaks and often appears only as a very indistinct 
collar on the stem, colored from catching the falling spores. The colors 
are generally pronounced and often extremely bright, there being very 
few prettier toadstools than those inclined to the blue or purple shades, 
which are not uncommon in the immature form. The color of the 
spores is also a marked feature, being rusty or brownish-ochraceous, 
turning the gills to the same color at maturity. On account of this 
change it is generally necessary to have specimens at both stages of 
growth to accurately determine the species. The gills are thin, attached 
to the stem in various manners, rarely slightly decurrent. 

Cortinarius is distinguished from Flammula by growing on the ground 
and by the bright ferruginous color of its spores. 

Cortinarius is a sturdy, hardy genus preferring northern latitudes and 
autumnal months, though several of its species grow as far south as Ala- 
bama, and one, a new species described by Professor Peck, is found on 
the Helderberg mountains in May. The genus contains many species, 
most of which produce in great numbers, yet being woods-growing, and 
coming as they do when leaves are falling, they are often missed because 
of their similarity to their surroundings. 

Heretofore, less than a dozen species have been reported as eaten. 
This number is now doubled. While several species are bitter and oth- 
ers equally unpleasant, not one has been accused of harm. It is highly 
probable that other varieties than those herein given will prove equally 
acceptable as food. I have tested all I have found in sufficient quantity 
to warrant passing judgment upon them. 

The genus does not contain as many species of superior excellence as 
other fleshy genera of like numbers. The flesh is frequently dry and of 



Ochrosporae 

a strong woody or musky flavor, which it does not lose in cooking. The Cortinarfus. 
stems are seldom cookable. All can be fried in butter, but cut in small 
pieces and well stewed, or stewed and served in patties, or made into 
croquettes are certain ways of keeping them in palate memory.

Oclirosporee 
pip-shaped, 9X7/A Cooke. Cortinarius. 

A very common and prolific species in West Virginia, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, North Carolina. Mcllvaine. 

Pushing from the earth in great clusters it raises the mat of leaves 
above it into hut-like mounds through which it seldom bursts. Yet side 
openings to its huts show its coziness, and reveal the ground thickly 
dusted with its spores. Detecting these mounds is part of the wood- 
craft of a toad-stool hunter. 

Where clusters are not dense, or the fungus is solitary, the stem is 
frequently swollen at the base, even bulbous. 

Both caps and stems are edible, but the stems are not equal to the 
caps. It is a valuable food species, because of its lateness and quantity. 
It is not of best quality. 

C. tur'malis Fr. turma, a troop. (Plate LXXXII, fig. 4, p. 306.) 
PileilS yellow-tan, most frequently darker at the disk, not changeable, 
compact, convex then plane, very obtuse, even, smooth (sometimes 
obsoletely piloso-virgate), when young veiled with pruinate but very 
fugacious villous down, soon naked, viscid. Flesh white. Stem some- 
times 3 in., sometimes 6 in. long, i in. thick, solid, very hard, rigid, 
cylindrical, here and there attenuated at the base, shining white when 
dry, when young sheatJied with a white woolly veil, naked when full 
grown. Cortina entirely fibrillose, superior and persistent in the form 
of a ring, at length ferruginous with the spores. Gills variously adnexed, 
rounded or emarginate, even decurrent with a tooth, crowded, serrated, 
white then clay-color. Fries. 

I find it edible and of great value, being plentiful in pine woods, 
Maryland. I have collected a bushel in less than an hour in October. 
Under pine needles forming mounds. Taylor. 

The localities and the habit of C. turmalis are very like that of C. 
sebaceus. The leaf mat broods the clusters. 

C. turmalis is on a par with C. sebaceus. Personally I prefer the 
latter,

Mushroom beds, manured soil in conservatories or in plant pots. 
Boston, Mass. R. K. Macadam. Haddonfield, N. J. C. Mcllvaine. 

This interesting species is closely allied to Cortinarius multiformis and 
belongs to the Section Phlegmacium. It has a slight odor of radishes 
and is pronounced edible by Mr. Mcllvaine. Its habitat is peculiar, 
but it possibly finds its way into conservatories and mushroom beds 
through the introduction of manure or soil, or leaf mold from the woods. 
It seems strange, however, that it has not yet been detected growing in 
the woods or fields. Hebeloma fastibile is said sometimes to invade 
mushroom beds, and our plant resembles it in so many particulars that 
it is with some hesitation I separate it. The chief differences are in 
the stem and spores. The former, in Hebeloma fastibile, is described 



Ochrosporae 

as solid and fibrous-squamose and the latter as 10x6 micromillimeters Cortinarius. 
in size. The brighter color of the smaller spores and the stuffed or 
hollow smooth stem of our plant will separate it from this species. 
Peck, Bull, of the Torrey Bot. Club, October, 1896. 

Cortinarius intrusus was a happy find. Several pints of it were col- 
lected by the author in February usually a famine month for the 
mycophagist. They grew on the ground, in beds among plants, and 
with potted plants in a hot-house in Haddonfield, N. J. The crop con- 
tinued well into the spring. The species is delicate, savory, and a most 
accommodating renegade from its kind. I have never found it else- 
where.

intense blue then becoming purplish, at length dingy cinnamon. Stem 
about 2 in. long, % in. thick (bulb more than an inch), firm, equally

The American species seldom entirely loses the bluish-purple color 
of its cap. The beautiful color fades somewhat or becomes splotched 
with yellow. Neither does the bulb ordinarily disappear with age. It 
is common. Taste of cap is mild, somewhat woody. They require 
long, slow stewing, and are better made into patties and croquettes.

CORTINARIUS COLLINITUS. 
About natural size. 



The Smeared cortinarius is much 
more common than the Violet cor- 
tinarius and has a much wider range. 
Both the cap and stem are covered 
with a viscid substance or gluten 
which makes it unpleasant to handle. 
The cap varies in color from yellow 

to golden or tawny-yellow and when the gluten on it has dried it is 
very smooth and shining. The flesh is white or whitish. The young 
gills have a peculiar bluish-white or dingy-white color which might be 
called grayish or clay color, but when mature they assume the color of 
the spores. They are sometimes minutely uneven on the edge. 

The stem is straight, solid, cylindrical and usually paler than the cap. 
When the gluten on it dries it cracks transversely, giving to the stem a 
peculiar scaly appearance. 

The cap is 1/23 in. broad, and the stem 24 in. long, and M % 
in. thick. 

The plant grows in thin woods, copses and partly cleared lands and 
may be found from August to September. 

It is well to peel the caps before cooking, since the gluten causes dirt 
and rubbish to adhere tenaciously to them. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

In 4ist Rep. N. Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist., p. 71, Professor Peck de- 
scribes a closely allied species, C. muscigenus, n. sp., "separated by its 
more highly-colored pileus, striate margin and even, not diffracted- 
squamose stem."

In appearance the Smeared cortinarius does not appeal to be eaten. 
Neither does an eel. But peeled both are inviting. Raw, the caps of 
this fungus have a strong woody smell and taste. This is somewhat 
subdued by cooking. 

I have found the plant in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and North 
Carolina, often among the leaves in mixed woods, but it prefers a goodly 
supply of light and the freedom of open places. It is often gregarious, 
sometimes tufted. 

C. io'des B. and C. PileilS 1/^-2 in., convex, at length plane,

This is a small but beautiful species, the pileus, lamellae and stem 
being of a bright-violet or purplish-violet hue. The spores are sub-

C. viola'ceus Fr. (Plate LXXXII, fig. 2, page 306.) One of our

pileus in the young plant, brownish-cinnamon in the mature plant. 
Stem solid, fibrillose, bulbous, colored like the pileus. Spores sub- 
elliptical, 12. 5/n long. 

The Violet cortinarius is a very beautiful mushroom and one easy of 
recognition. At first the whole plant is uniformly colored, but with age 
the gills assume a dingy ochraceous or brownish-cinnamon hue. The 
cap is generally well formed and regular and is beautifully adorned with 
little hairy scales or tufts. These are rarely shown in figures of the 
European plant, but they are quite noticeable in the American plant and 
should not be overlooked. The flesh is more or less tinged with violet. 

The gills when young are colored like the cap. They are rather 
broad, notched at the inner extremity and narrowed toward the margin 
of the cap. When mature they become dusted with the spores whose 
color they take 

The stem also is colored like the cap. It is swollen into a bulb at 
the base and sometimes a faint ochraceous band may be seen near the 
top. This is due to the falling spores which lodge on the webby fila- 
ments of the veil remaining attached to the stem. 

Cap 2-4 in. broad. Stem 3-5 in. long, about > in. thick. Peck,

being distinguishable by the naked eye. July. Peck, 5oth Rep. N. Y.

The spider web veil is exquisitely displayed in this species. This, 
with its strongly bulbous base and violet tinge throughout, easily mark 
it. Though usually solitary great numbers of it are found in its settle- 
ments. The mixed woods of central New Jersey abound with it in July, 
August and September. Throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia 
it is common, and is reported from several other states. In Redman's 
woods, near Haddonfield, N. J., a densely clustered form of singular 
beauty occurs. A dozen individuals of various forms and sizes with 
swollen stems form a compact mass, rich in color, and cutting crisp and 
juicy as an apple. They are far better than other Cortinarii I have 
eaten. I have not seen it elsewhere.

CORTINARIUS ARMILLATUS. 



Agaricaceee 

Cortinarins. Odor of radish. A very striking species. From the pileus not being 
hygrophanous, at the first smooth and at length torn into fibrils or 
squamulose, it might easily be taken for a species - of Inoloma. The 
cortina itself is paler than the zones. It differs from all others in these 
zones. The rings are usually somewhat oblique. Pries. 

Professor Peck in the 23d Rep. N. Y. State Cab. Nat. Hist., describes 
the American species as follows : 

"PiletlS fleshy, thick, convex or subcampanulate, then expanded, 
minutely squamulose, yellowish-red. Lamellae not close, broad, slightly 
emarginate, whitish-ochraceous, then cinnamon. Stipe stout, solid, 
fibrillose, whitish, girt with one to four red bands, bulbous. 

"Height 4-6 in., breadth of pileus 2-4 in., stipe 4-8 in. thick. 

"Woods. North Elba. August. 

"A large and noble species. The margin of the pileus is thin and 
sometimes uneven ; the upper band on the stem is usually the brightest 
and most regular. The pileus is not distinctly hygrophanous."

September 8, 1897, Mr E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J., sent me 
several specimens new to me and remarkable in having two well-defined 
veils, the lower and thicker one of which left a dark zone upon the 
stem, the upper, fibrillose, was more persistent, but left a fainter im- 
pression. These veils are not mentioned in Professor Peck's description 
of the American species, but are prominently noted in that of Fries, as 
above. In a very young specimen both veils were present. Cap light 
brown, minutely squamulose, with a few small red spots; margin thin, 
involute, flesh thick, yellowish, firm; gills distant, rounded behind, 
slightly emarginate, alternate ones short, light brown inclined to cinereous 
on edge. 

Spores brown. Small young specimens did not show bulbous stem 
as distinct as larger and older ones. 

I afterward found several specimens at Mr. Gretna, Pa., September 
and October, 1897. 

The flesh is excellent, closely resembling Pholiota subsquarrosa. 
The species seems to be rare. If found in quantity it will prove one of 
our very best edibles.

from the hymenophore and easily separable from it. Spores dingy-white 
or ferruginous. 

Fleshy putrescent fungi, margin of pileus at first involute, then con- 
timially and gradually unfolding and expanding. Fries. 

Pileus symmetrical or eccentric. Stem central, eccentric or wanting. 
Edge of gills entire, sharp. 

The marked features of this genus are the strongly involute margin, 
the soft, tough, decurrent gills, separating readily from the flesh, and 
the color of the spores. 

The members of this genus possess some of the characters of Boletus. 
The gills separate easily from the hymenophore as do the tubes of the 
latter, and their anastomosing tendency is in P. porosus so marked that 
the hymenium consists of large angular tubes. The gills of P. solidus 
B. and C. form pores at the base, and its spores are elongated, both 
features indicating an affinity with Boletus.

So far as known the species of this genus are harmless. Many of 
them are large, fleshy and inviting in appearance, but their flesh is 
usually dry and coarse, and, though absorbent, is hard to cook tender. 
P. atrotomentosus, which seems to be rare, is an exception. The flesh 
of this species being firm in texture and readily made into a first-class 
dish. 

LEPIS'TA. 

P. lepis'ta Fr. lepista, a pan. Pileus 2-4 in. broad, flat or depressed, 
dirty-white, smooth, sometimes minutely cracked near the margin 
which is thin,. involute and often undulate. Stem very variable in length, 
1-4 in., %% in. thick, dingy white or cream, solid, white inside, 
equal, with a cartilaginous cuticle passing between the gills and the 
flesh of the pileus, base blunt, villous, white. Gills very decurrent, 
crowded, 2-3 lines broad, slightly branched but not at the base, dingy- 
white becoming darker, 

Spores reddish, becoming dingy brown. Broadly pyriforme 6x8/*

On ground in woods and margins of woods. 

Flesh white. Gills narrow, crowded, brittle, decurrent, dingy-white 
or pale-buff, easily separating from cap. Stem solid, elastic, at length 
hollow, often short, an inch long, tapering downward, frequently up to 
four inches in length and equal, base villose. 

Resembling Lactarius piperatus and some forms of Clitocybe. It is 
separated from the former by the absence of milk and from the latter by 
its involute margin. The Clitocybe resembling it are all edible. 

Smell strong, like old oily nuts. Edible but coarse.

Found near Philadelphia, gregarious in old woods. September. In 
New Jersey in pine woods on stumps and on the ground, probably 
growing from roots. Mcllvaine. 

Grows singly or cespitose, sometimes in large tufts, when the pileus is 
frequently irregular from compression. In wet weather the pileus is 
moist and sometimes obscurely mottled with dark spots. Occasionally 
it has an unpleasant dirt-like odor. Peck. 

Cordier considers this species suspicious and Paulet inutile on account 
of its bad taste. 

The flesh differs from most Paxilli in being very fine grained and 
cooked is of the consistency of a marshmallow. The taste is marked 
but pleasant. 



Agaricaceae 



Series IV, PORPHYRO'SPOR-ffi (Pratelli). Gr. purple. 

Spores typically black-purple or brownish-purple, more rarely dusky 
brown. (It is to be observed that the spores vary in color according to 
the color of the ground on which they are deposited. ) There are sterile 
forms with the gills persistently white (A. obturatus, A. udus) . Those 
species are more deceptive in which the gills continue for a long time 
white, and even begin to decay before they are discolored by the spores ; 
these may be easily mistaken for Leucospori. Fries. 

Pratelli is the name given by the early authors to this series, based 
upon the spore color; Porphyrosporae is the name now used. The spe- 
cies within the group are closely allied to those having black spores 
without a tinge of purple or violet (Melanosporae), but in none of the 
species do the gills deliquesce as in Coprinus, neither are there resupi- 
nate or lateral stemmed species. 

There is a present tendency to do away with this series and include 
all dark-spored species in the Melanosporae. Professor Atkinson and 
Bertha Stoneman, in their "Provisional Key to the Genera of Hymen- 
omit the series and give " Melanosporae, Gill and Butz 
(Pratellae and Coprinariae in broadest sense). 
Spores dark brown, purplish-brown or black." 
It is frequently difficult to determine by the 
spore-color of this series even to which series a 
specimen belongs. Many of our best edibles 
belong in this series. I know of none noxious.

AGAR'ICUS. 

Agaricon, a Greek name for fungi, said to be derived from the name 

of a town, Agara. 

Pileus fleshy, flesh of the stem different from that of the pileus, fur- 
nished with a distinct ring. Gills at first enclosed by the veil, free, 
rounded behind, at first white or whitish, in some species this stage last- 
ing but a short time, then pink or reddish, at length dark purplish- 
brown from the spores. Spores brown, brownish or reddish-purple. 

On the ground, generally in pastures, meadows or manured ground, 
a few species occur in woods. 

Analogous with Lepiota of the white-spored series. Stropharia also 
bears a ring and has similar colored spores, but is separated by the flesh 
of stem and pileus being continuous and the gills being more or less 
adnate. 

Formerly in Agaricus as sub-genus Psalliota (psallion, psalion, in 
poetry, a ring). When Psalliota was raised to generic rank it was given 
the name of the great genus Agaricus as a mark of distinction on ac- 
count of its including the most widely known and useful mushroom of 
the world Agaricus campester. The name Psalliota is not in modern 
use. 

Old Agaricus included many subgenera and consequently many more 
species. Now it contains but few. All of them are highly flavored and of 
marked excellence. Before the subgenera under Agaricus were promoted 
to full generic standing it was customary to state the name of a species 
thus: Agaricus (Psalliota) campester. Agaricus (Stropharia) semi- 
orbicularis. This was lengthy and clumsy. In 'the older books this 
form prevails. Often, however, the subgenus is omitted before the 
name, which compels the student to look up the subgenus to which the 
species belongs. The older books are therefore puzzling to modern 
students, who find there simply the name Agaricus to guide them. The 
present genus of a known species in old Agaricus can be easily found 
by looking in the index for its specific name. The name of the genus 
follows it in parentheses. 

All of the genus can be cooked in any desired way.

Var. villa ticus Brond. belonging to a villa. Cap scaly. Stem scaly. Agaricus. 

Var. Jiorteri sis Cke. growing in gardens. Cap brownish or yellow- 
ish-brown, covered with fibrils or minute hairs. This is a cultivated 
species. 

"Var. Bu'channi. Cap white, smooth, depressed in center, the mar- 
gin naked. Stem stout. Ring thin, lacerated. A rare variety, some- 
times occurring in mushroom beds. 

"Var. elongdlus elongated. Long-stemmed variety. Pileus small, 
smooth, convex, the margin adorned with the adherent remains of the 
lacerated veil. Stem long, slender, slightly thickened toward the base. 
Ring slight or evanescent. This is also a variety of mushroom beds. 

"Var. vaporarius. Green-house variety (A. vaporarius Vitt. ) Pileus 
brownish, coated with long hairs or fibrils. Stem hairy-fibrillose, be- 
coming transversely scaly. Conservatories, cellars, etc. Not differing 
greatly from Var. hortensis." Peck, 36th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

The A. campester is known the world over as the common mush- 
room. It is cosmopolitan, appearing in pastures and rich places from 
spring and until long after severe frosts. It is the sweet morsel of gour- 
mets. Indirectly it has done more damage than the assembled vicious- 
ness of all other toadstools. It is by mistaking the young button forms 
of the deadly Amanita for the button forms of the common mushroom 
that most cases of fatal toadstool poisoning are brought about. It is, 
also, usually the persons who think they know the mushroom, and can 
not be deceived, that get poisoned. If two rules are observed danger 
can be avoided, (i) Never eat a fungus gathered in the woods be- 
lieving it to be the mushroom. The typical A. campester does not 
grow in the woods ; species of Agaricus somewhat resembling it do. 
(2) Look at the gills; those of the mushroom are at first a light-pink 
which rapidly, as the plant matures, darken to a dark-brown, purplish- 
brown, or purplish-black. This is due to the ripening of the spores. 
Those of the Amanita are constantly white. 

Pages could be written upon the mushroom and its culture, and reci- 
pes for the cooking of it would fill a volume. One important thing is 
omitted from them all it is culinary heresy to peel a mushroom. Much 
of the flavor lies in the skin, as it does in that of apples, apricots, 
peaches, grapes, cherries and other fruits. The mushroom should be 
wiped with a coarse flannel or towel until the skin is clean. See chapter 
on cooking, etc.

Agaricaceae 

Agaricus. Lafayette B. Mendel, in American Journal of Physiology, March, 
1898, gives the following analysis of A. campester: 

Two varieties of the common mushroom were collected in New Ha- 
ven. Fifteen specimens of one variety weighed i% ounce, an average 
weight of 43 grains each. The analysis gave :

cules when young, somewhat attenuated, even, smooth, white, becoming 
somewhat light yellow. Ring medial, torn, fugacious, of the same 
color. Gills rounded-free behind, crowded, soft, broader in front,

In taste and smell A. silvaticus resembles A. silvicola, but is stronger. 
It is a frequent but not common species in the localities where I have 
found it. Quantities of it have not occurred, but myself and friends 
have eaten it for years, knowing no distinction in effect between it and 
allied species. Its strong taste requires that it be well cooked. It does 
not lose its high flavor, which may be objectionable to some. I prefer 
using its juices as a flavoring. 

A. diminuti'vus Pk. diminutive. PileuS thin, fragile, at first con- 
vex, then plane or centrally depressed, sometimes slightly umbonate, 
whitish or yellowish, faintly spotted with small thin silky appressed 
brownish scales, the disk brownish or reddish-brown. ' Lamellae close,

This is a small but symmetrical and beautiful Agaric. It is perhaps 
too closely related to the preceding species (A. silvaticus) , of which it 
may possibly prove to be a mere variety or dwarf form. Its pileus is 
quite thin and fragile. Usually the darker or reddish hue of the disk 
gradually loses itself in the paler color of the margin, but sometimes the 
whole surface is tinged with red. Peck, 36th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

vaticus that its being a dwarf form of the latter seemed more than prob- 
able. Its edible qualities are the same. 

A. Rod'mani Pk. Pileus rather thick, firm, at first convex, then 
nearly or quite plane, with decurved margin, smooth or rarely slightly 
cracked into scales on the disk, white or whitish, becoming yellowish 
or subochraceous on the disk, the flesh white, unchangeable. Lamellae 
close, narrow, rounded behind, free, reaching nearly or quite to the 
stem, at first whitish then pink or reddish-pink, finally blackish-brown. 
Stem short, subequal, solid, whitish, smooth below the ring, often 
scurfy or slightly mealy-squamulose above; ring variable, thick or thin, 
entire or lacerated, at or below the middle of the stem. Spores broadly 
elliptical or subglobose, generally uninucleate, 5-6x4-5^.

Grassy ground and paved gutters. Astoria, L. I. Rev. W* Rodman. 
Washington Park, Albany. May to July. 

This species is intermediate between A. campestris and A. arvensis, 
from both of which it may be distinguished by its narrow gills, solid stem 
and smaller, almost globose, spores. In size, shape of the pileus and 
general appearance it most resembles A. campestris, but in the whitish 
primary color of the gills and in the yellowish tints which the pileus 
often assumes, it approaches nearer to A. arvensis. Peck, 

36th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

I can now add my own testimony to that of Mr. Rodman as to its 
edibility. Its flesh is firm but crisp, not tough, and its flavor, though 
not equal to that of the common mushroom, is nevertheless agreeable, 
and its use as food is perfectly safe. Peck, Rep. 49. 

This species has grown freely for several years at Hull and Cohasset, 
Mass. It is usually found about June ist, and is not seen again until 
early autumn. It is the handsomest mushroom I have seen, and its 
edible qualities are on a par with its appearance. Macadam.

taste agreeable, odor distinct, suggestive of the odors of the seashore. 
Lamellae narrow, close, free, pinkish becoming purplish-brown with age, 
the edge white. Stem short, stout, firm, solid, equal, sometimes bulb-

This is a very interesting and an excellent mushroom. Dr. Dearborn 
writes that he has used it on the table for fourteen years and that it is 
the only mushroom that he has ever eaten in which the stem is as good 
as the cap. He considers it the most hearty and satisfying of all the 
numerous species that he has ever eaten. Both its taste and odor is 
suggestive of the sea. The latter is quite strong, and perceptible by 
one riding along the road by whose side the mushrooms are growing. 
They sometimes grow in semicircles and attain a larger size in warm 
weather than in the colder weather of autumn. They are most abun- 
dant in August. The flesh, when cut or broken, quickly assumes a pink

character and with the maritime habitat makes the species easy to rec- 
ognize. Another species, Agaricus haemorrhoidarius Kalchb. exhibits 
a similar change of color in its wounded flesh, but is of very rare occur- 
rence with us, does not, so far as ascertained, grow near the sea, has a 
darker cap and a long hollow stem. The stem in the maritime mush- 
room is short and solid. Its collar is very slight and easily destroyed.

This is a small mushroom, peculiar in having the young gills of a dark 
color and in the absence of any pink hues. The gills sometimes be- 
come moist and manifest a tendency to deliquesce. The drying speci-

Agaricaceee 

Agaricus. Cultivated fields and pastures. Summer and autumn. 

This species is so closely related to the common mushroom that it is 
regarded by some authors as a mere variety of it. Even the renowned 
Persoon is said to have written concerning it : " It appears to be only a 
variety of A. campestris." Fries also says that it is commonly not dis- 
tinguished from A. campestris, but that it is diverse in some respects; 
its white flesh being unchangeable, its gills never deliquescing, remain- 
ing a long time pale and not becoming dark-red in middle age. Berk- 
eley says of it: "A coarse but wholesome species, often turning yellow 
when bruised." Peck, 36th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Unless the numerical system of John Phoenix to express degrees of 
quality is adopted by a mycophagists' congress, and one species of 
fungus is chosen as the standard of excellence, the comparative excel- 
lence of species will never be settled. English epicures shun A. 
arvensis ; the French prefer it. Berkeley says it is inferior to the com- 
mon mushroom; Vittadini says it is very sapid and very nutritious. So 
opinion varies. Individual tastes must decide excellence. Comparison 
never will. Toadstools differ in substance, texture and taste as one 
meat or vegetable differs from another. Beef could not be chosen as 
the standard for meats, or cabbage as the standard for vegetables. 
Agaricus arvensis is good.

A. s-ilvicola, by many authors considered a variety of A. campester, 
is, seemingly, becoming common. Professor Peck in 46th Rep. has 
made the abrupt bulb and its usual double veil distinctive marks which 
ally it to A. arvensis. He therefore calls it var. abruptus. As this 
book goes to press Professor Peck writes me that he concludes var. 
abruptus to be a good and distinct species. It is therefore given as 
such. While familiar with it since 1881, I never found it in quantity 
until 1898, at Mt. Gretna, Pa. There, among the straw and rubbish 
of abandoned camps on wood margins, it grew in great quantity; 
sometimes singly, at others in crowded clusters. When growing singly 
it exhibits all the characteristics of its description; when clustered, 
the stems are not always bulbous. The caps are thin but fleshy, 
brittle and bear a disproportionate width to the stem like a plate on 
a pipe stem. The cap^s when mature are usually tinged with yellow and 
are spread flat; the ring is large, often double, yellowish, often torn, 
fragments of it frequently hang from the cap margin ; the bulb when

Agaricacese 

Agaricus. perfect is small, abrupt, as if it had once been round but the stem 
pushed into it. It has a strong spicy mushroom odor and taste, and 
makes a high-flavored dish. It is delicious with meats. It is the 
very best mushroom for catsup. Mixed with Russulae or Lactarii or 
other species lacking in mushroom flavor, it enriches the entire dish. 
The stems, excepting of the very young, are tough. 

Larvae do not infest A. silvicola. Its habit of growth shows it to be 
cultivatable. It has but one draw-back. Growing as it does in woods 
and in the presence of the poisonous Amanita, it is possible for the 
careless collector to confound the two. The Amanitae have larger bulbs, 
cups at the base, and white gills; the A. silvicola has no volva, has 
whitish gills when very young only, they become pinkish, then a marked 
blackish-brown.

Indiana, H. I. Miller, 1898; Haddonfield, N. J., Mcllvaine. 

June 2, 1896, I found several specimens of a fungus new to me, and 
sent them to Professor Peck for identification. He pronounced it a 
dwarf form of his species A. subrufescens. The cluster grew on a flor- 
ist's compost pile at Haddonfield, N. J. Its flesh has a flavor like that 
of almonds. 

This species is now cultivated and has manifest advantages over the 
marketed species it is easier to cultivate, very productive, produces in 
less time after planting the spawn, is free from attacks of insects, carries 
better and keeps longer. 

Amateurs are likely to succeed in growing it, and to have goodly crops 
of mushrooms instead of disappointments. 

A. placo'myces Pk. Gr. a flat cake. (Plate XCIII, fig. 3, p. 332.) 
Pileus thin, at first convex, becoming flat with age, whitish, brown in 
the center and elsewhere adorned with minute brown scales. Lamella} 
close, white, then pinkish, finally blackish-brown. Stem smooth, an- 
nulate, stuffed or hollow, bulbous, white or whitish, the bulb often 
stained with yellow. Spores elliptical, 5-6.5/1* long. 

Cap 2-4 in. broad. Stem 3-5 in. long, H to nearly % in. thick. 

It grows in the borders of hemlock woods or under hemlock trees 
from July to September. It has been eaten by Mr. C. L. Shear, who 
pronounces it very good. I have not found it in sufficient q-uantity to 
give it a trial. This mushroom is very closely related to the wood 
mushroom or silvan mushroom, Agaricus silvaticus, a species which is 
also recorded as edible, but which is apparently more rare in our state 
(New York) than even the flat-cap mushroom. This differs from the 
silvan mushroom in its paler color, in having the cap more minutely, 
persistently and regularly scaly, and in its being destitute of a prominent 
center. In the silvan mushroom thte scales, when present, are few, and 
they disappear with age. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Mrs. E. C. Anthony, Gouverneur, N. Y., June, 1898, writes: "In 
great abundance on lawn, tumbling over one another in their haste to 
make their appearance. One of the largest, which did not have half a 
chance to display its proportions, would probably measure 7 in., per- 
haps more. When mature they crack across the top, showing the white

perceptible odor when fresh." 

Indiana, H '. I. Miller, edible, good. 

Specimens sent to me by Mrs. Anthony, though not fresh, were eaten 
by me. They very much resembled the common mushroom, but proba- 
bly, owing to their condition, were not so tender. 

I have not found the species. The illustration is after a painting by 
Mrs. E. C. Anthony, 

A. varia'bilis Pk. variable. (Plate XCIII, fig. i, p. 332.) Cap 
2-6 in. across, ovate, bell-shaped, irregularly convex and wavy, margin 
incurved but never striate, smooth, minutely fibrillose, with few remain- 
ing floccose scales; mature plant pure white, when young distinctly 
tinged with lilac and here and there with yellow when mature, slightly, 
broadly umbonate and depressed around umbo, cracks along gills. 
Flesh thick in center, very thin, even membranaceous toward, margin, 
spongy, unchangeable. Gills free, close, thin, flaccid, ventricose, nar- 
row next stem, but few short, pure-white when young, then dark-umber 
without purple tinge. Stem equal, tubed, white, silky, smooth above 
ring, rippled and minutely furfuraceous (scurfy) below, flocculose-fur- 
furaceous when young, densely hairy at base, and occasionally slightly 
expanding, but not bulbous, densely cespjtose with a coarse, white, 
root-like mycelium. Veil heavy at first, mottled with yellow scales be- 
neath ; as cap expands veil becomes, thin, like tissue paper, ruptures at 
both stem and margin leaving torn ring on stem and appendiculate frag- 
ments on edge of cap. 

Spores shed in great quantity, rich dark umber-brown without shade 
of purple. 

Taste strong like almond. Smell slightly of musk, like the* running 
mycelium of A. campester. 

Found at Mt. Gretna, Pa. Charles Mcllvaine. 

I have never found worms in this species. It is very prolific and its 
habitat shows that it can be cultivated. Its freedom from worms and 
lasting carrying quality will make it commercially valuable. 

It grew in an old roofless stable from September until after several 
frosts, in enormous quantity, 25 or 3.0 pounds in a patch. It differs 
from A. subrufescens in not having a shade of red about it, in its very 
distinct light-lilac cap when full grown, and in its snow-white youth.

This species is remarkable for the peculiar upper surface of the pileus 
which is broken into pyramidal areas. The sides of these are marked 
by parallel lines in such a way that they appear as if formed by small 
tablets placed one upon another, each successive tablet being a little 
smaller than the one immediately preceding it. Only dried and broken 
specimens have been seen by me and the notes of the collector do not 
give the color of the young lamellae. There is a trace of a thick ring on 
the broken stem of one specimen. Peck, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol.

The species belonging to this genus are rather small, and from their 
habitats are frequently passed or overlooked. Yet many of them are 
common and plentiful. Those which have been tested are excellent and 
worth seeking in their season. The entire genus has been under a 
cloud. Writers upon it assert some of its members to be dangerously 
poisonous. So far as carefully tested by the writer no doubtful one has

soaking weather in later autumn in shaded woods; it is large (pileus 
and stem 3 in. and more), stem squarrose with white spreading scales, 
intensely verdigris or azure-blue-pelliculose and very glutinous. From 
this there is a long series of forms with the gluten more separating (on* 
the separation of the gluten the pileus becomes yellow), and the scales 
alike of the pileus and stem rubbed off. Finally, a smaller form occurs 
in open meadows, stem scarcely 2 in. long, only 2 lines thick, becoming 
azure-blue-green and without scales, pileus 12 in. broad, pale verdigris

species. As it is asserted to be poisonous by European writers it may 
be. M. C. Cooke says: "It has the reputation, which is somewhat 
general on the continent, of being poisonous, but probably this is only 
assumed from its disagreeable taste and repulsive appearance." Collect- 
ors are cautioned to look out for it, and not to eat of it carelessly.

common, frequent, solitary species, easily recognized by its hemi- 
spherical cap, dark mottled gills. At first sight it resembles* Naucoria 
semiorbicularis. 

The caps are equal to any mushroom. I have eaten it since 1881.

on the stem. Stem fleshy, similar 
in substance to that of the pileus with 
which it is continuous. Gills at- 
tached to the stem, sometimes with a 
notch at the juncture (emarginate), 
occasionally separating and then ap- 
pearing to be free. 

Generally cespitose, mostly grow- 
ing on wood above or under the

Members of this purple-spored genus grow upon decayed wood, 
either standing or as roots in the ground, or from ground heavily laden 
with woody material. They grow singly, in groups, or in densely- 
tufted or overlapping masses. The several species vary in shades of 
yellow, red, orange, brick-color and brown; their caps are from i 6 in. 
across ; their stems are short or long, as the number in the cluster per- 
mits ; when growing singly the stems are short and sturdy. There is a 
floccose veil, or remnants of one, about the stem. The gills are yel- 
lowish, greenish, olivaceous or greenish shades of yellow, gray, purple, 
almost black. They are showy, easily recognized and are found from 
September until mid-winter. I have gathered them when frozen hard. 
The flesh is solid, or spongy, flexible or fragile, white or yellowish; the 
tastes are sweet, nutty, bitter and saponaceous. Patches of them and 
they are frequent in almost every woods in the land often yield several 
bushels. Tons of them annually go to waste. 

Old authors and some copyists say "the species are not edible, the 
tough ones being bitter, the fragile ones almost void of flesh." Eighteen 
years of experience with them warrants my saying that there is not a 
single wild genus approaching it in economic value, and when its most 
prominent species are properly cooked, few equal it in consistency and 
flavor. As a pickle the Hypholomas have no superior. 
23 ' 353 



Agaricacese 

Hyphoioma. Half a dozen or more of the species are exceedingly difficult to sep- 
arate. Professor Peck has happily made a new species, H. perplexum, 
which is well named. For all culinary purposes these affiliated species 
may be gathered under that convenient name ; for botanic purposes his 
description covers several perplexing characteristics common to what 
have been written as separate species, and covers a composite species. 

The occasional bitter taste of some species is not constant, and can 
not be relied upon as a distinguishing mark. In the same tufts some 
individuals may be mild, others bitter; some individuals in groups are in 
a position and of an age to absorb water ; others are not. There will 
be a marked difference in their taste raw. A few in the same group may 
have been infested by insects ; others not. Those infested are often in- 
tensely bitter, while their companions are of pleasant flavor. The same 
remarks apply to neighboring clusters and individuals. I am of the 
opinion, from long observation, that the bitter is largely due to the in- 
jury and excrement of larvae. Changes of taste occur in toadstools in 
a most marked and rapid manner. Apples from the same tree, chest- 
nuts from the same tree, acorns from the same oak, radishes from the 
same seed, blackberries from the same bush, differ widely in taste. Why 
not toadstools of the same species? 

I have often seen species of this genus, described as having stems up 
to 5 in. long, stretch and twist their stems to over a foot in order to get 
their caps from the inside of, or from a crack in a decaying stump, out into 
the light; and I have seen stems of the same species stout, solid and 
sturdy when individuals grew upright and singly. But wherever and 
however they grow, Hypholomas are safe. I have eaten them indis- 
criminately since 1 88 1, and as long ago as 1885 published their edibility.

Porphyrosporae 

The Perplexing Hypholoma has received the name because it is one Hyphoioma. 
of a group of five or six very closely allied species, whose separation 
from each other is somewhat difficult and perplexing. Of these six 
species three have a decidedly bitter, unpleasant flavor, and three are 
mild, or not decidedly bitter, if we may rely on the published descrip- 
tions of them. The three bitter ones, also, have no purplish tints to 
the mature gills; but two of the mild ones have. By using these and 
other distinguishing characters the six species may be tabulated and 
their several peculiarities more clearly shown. 

Taste bitter I 

Taste mild, or not clearly bitter 3 

I. Stem solid or stuffed, flesh whitish, gills whitish, then 

sooty-olive sublateritium 

I . Stem hollow, flesh yellow 2 

2. Cap yellow or tinged with tawny, stem yellow, gills 

yellow, becoming greenish fasciculare 

2. Cap brick-red, stem ferruginous, gills green, becom- 
ing olive elaeodes 

3. Cap red or brick-red, with a yellow margin; gills yel- 
low, then greenish, finally purplish-brown perplexum 

3. Cap yellow, or slightly tawny on the disk only 4 

4. Gills gray, becoming purplish-brown capnoides 

4. Gills yellow, becoming gray, neither green nor pur- 
plish epixanthum 

Probably in general appearance the Perplexing hypholoma most 
nearly resembles the brick-red Hypholoma, H. sublateritium; but it has 
often been mistaken for the tufted Hypholoma, H. fasciculare. From 
this it may be separated by the more red cap, the whitish flesh, the 
purplish-brown color of the mature gills, and the mild flavor. FromH. 
sublateritium it is distinguished by its usually smaller size, more slender 
hollow stem, the yellow greenish and purplish tints of the gills, and the 
absence of a bitter flavor. Some may prefer to consider it a variety of 
this fungus, rather than a distinct species. 

Its cap is 1-3 in. broad, its stem 2-3 in. long and 2-4 lines thick. 
It commonly grows in clusters, though sometimes singly, on or about 
old stumps or prostrate trunks of trees, in woods or open places. The 
caps of the lower ones in a cluster are often defiled and apparently dis- 
colored by the spores that have lodged on them from the upper ones. 

355 



Agaricaceae 

Hyphoioma. It appears in autumn, and continues until freezing weather stops its 
growth. It is a very common species, as well as a late one, and may 
often be gathered in large quantity. Its flavor is not first quality, but 
with good preparation it makes a very acceptable dish. It has been 
tested by myself and correspondents several times, and has been proved 
harmless. Peck, 49th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

West Virginia, 1881-1885; New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsyl- 
vania, October to January. On stumps, roots, ground containing de- 
cayed woody matter. Mcllvaine. 

H. perplexum is abundant in most if not all the states. I have eaten 
it and its allied species since 1881 ; dried them, pickled them, and fed 
them to many. If the collector gets puzzled, as he will, over one or 
all of these species, because no description fits, he can whet his patience 
and appetite by calling it H. perplexum and graciously eating it. 

H. capnoi'des Fr. Gr. like smoke, from the color of the gills. 
Pileus I in. sometimes 3 in. broad, ochraceous-yellowisJi, fleshy, convex, 
then flattened, obtuse, dry, smooth. Flesh somewhat thin, white. Stem 
23 in. long, 24 lines thick, growing together at the base, hollow, 
equal, often curved and flexuous, becoming silky-even, pallid, whitish at 
the apex, here and there striate, becoming rust-colored under the surface- 
covering when old. Cortina appendiculate, white, then becoming 
brownish-purple. Gills adnate, easily separating, somewhat crowded, 
rather broad, arid, at first bluish-gray then becoming brownish-purple.

pleasant. The basket is soon filled from its clusters. There is not a 
better Hyphoioma. The slightly soapy taste which attaches to most of 
the abundant and better known species is absent in this.

Porphyrosporae 

H. fascicula'ris Huds. fasciculus, a small bundle. (Plate XCVIII, 
P- 352.) PileilS about 2 in. broad, light yellow, the disk commonly 
darker, fleshy, thin, convex, then flattened, somewhat umbonate or 
obtuse, even, smooth, dry. Flesh light yellow. Stem very variable 
in length, hollow, thin, incurved or flexuous, fibrillose, of the same 
color as the pileus and flesh. Gills adnate, very crowded, linear, some- 
what deliquescent, sulphur-yellow then becoming green. 

It is very easily distinguished from the preceding species by its bitter 
odor and taste, light-yellow flesh, and somewhat deliquescent, sulpJiur- 
yellow then green gills. It forms also more crowded clusters. There 
are many remarkable varieties ; one robustior ( more robust ) , stem 
thickened at the base, another nana (dwarf), both on the ground.

"It is very usual to regard this as a poisonous species, but possibly 
it is not so in reality." Cooke. 

West Virginia, 1881, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Mcllvaine. 

A very common species appearing in October and lasting until well 
into the winter, growing in large, overlapping masses or in tufts from 
old stumps or roots, and about trees where decay has begun. Some- 
times solitary. It is then short-stemmed and sturdy. There are sev- 
eral closely allied species. To know the one from the other, a careful 
study of the group is necessary. (See introduction to genus, H. 
epixanthum, H. sublateritium, H. capnoides, H. elaeodes, and H. per- 
plexum.) Old authors give it as bitter and poisonous. The bitter is 
not always present. Any there is disappears in cooking. It is not 
poisonous, but one of our most valuable species. I have eaten it since 
1 88 1. A little lemon juice or sherry will cover the slightly saponaceous 
taste sometimes present. The caps only are good. It makes a choice 
pickle and a good catsup. 

H. epixan'thum Fr. Gr. epixanthos, yellowish-brown. Pileus 2-3

pileus, white. Gills adnate, crowded, at first light yellow-white, at 
length becoming ash-colored, not deliquescent, and not becoming purple 
or green. 

Strong smelling, odor acid ; extremely variable in stature ; not hy- 
grophanous. Fries.

(See H. perplexum, H. sublateritium and compare descriptions.) 

This species, in common with its allies, is extremely hard to deter- 
mine. When growing singly from roots or from ground heavily charged 
with decaying wood, it is a sturdy, solid plant; when in clusters the 
stem is longer, more flexible and the whole character of the plant is 
modified. Except for botanic purposes there is no occasion to puzzle 
over it. It is in every way an excellent and useful fungus. 

H. disper'sus Fr. dispergo, to scatter. Pileus i-i/ in. broad, 
tawny-honey-color, not hygrophanous, slightly fleshy, bell-shaped then 
convex, at length expanded, even, superficially silky round the margin 
with the veil, or squamulose, otherwise even and smooth. Flesh thin, 
a little paler than the pileus. Stem 2 in. or a little more long, 2 lines 
thick, tubed, equal, tense and straight, tough, fibrilloso- silky , somewhat 
rust-colored, becoming dingy-brown at the base, pale at the apex. 
Gills adnate, thin, ventricose, broad, 3-4 lines, crowded, at first pallid- 
straw color, at length crowded, obsoletely green. Fries. 

Gills broader than H. fascicularis, etc. Solitary, scarcely ever ces- 
pitose. On pine stumps and the ground. April to November.

Its habit is the same as H. fascicularis, to which it is closely allied, 
and to me seems but a form of this very variable species. It is equally 
good. 

H. sublateri'tium Schaeff. sub and later, a brick. (Plate XCVII, 
fig- 3 P- 35 2 -) Pileus 2-3 in. and more broad, tawny-brick-red, but 
paler round the margin and covered over with a superficial, somewhat 
silky, whitish cloudiness (arising from the veil), fleshy, convexo-plane, 
obtuse, discoid, dry, even, becoming smooth. Flesh compact, white, 
then becoming yellow. Stem 3-4 in. long, 3-5 lines thick, stuffed, 
stout and firm, commonly manifestly attenuated downward, rarely equal, 
scaly-fibrillose , fibrils pallid, rust-colored downward. Cortina superior, 
at first white, at length becoming black. Gills adnate, more or less 
crowded according to stature, narrow, at first dingy-yellowish and darker 
at the base, then sooty, and at length inclining to olivaceous. 

Spores brownish purple. Somewhat cespitose. Stem incurved from 
position. There are many varieties: B, somewhat solitary, the pileus 
and stem, which is thickened at the base, of the same color, reddish. 
C, smaller, pileus light yellowish, the hollow stem equal. Schaeff. 

Var. sqnamo'sum, Cooke. Pileus convex, bright brick-red, shading 
to yellow at the margin, spotted with superficial scales. Flesh very 
thick, yellowish. Gills narrowish, adnate. Stem elongated, stout, pale

young.

Edible. Dr. Taylor, 1893. Dept. of Agr. Rep. No. 5. 

H. sublateritium has many forms. Both Fries and Stevenson indi- 
cate this as a variable species and my own observation confirms the 
truth of this. 

This is a very common autumnal species, lasting into the winter. Old 
authors give it as bitter and very poisonous. I tested it in 1881 and 
have been eating it, in common with all Hypholomas I have found, ever 
since. At times it is bitter. I believe this to be due to the passage of 
larvae through the flesh. Unattacked specimens are slightly saponaceous 
to the taste while others in the same bunch are bitter. 

VlS'CIDI. Pileus viscid, etc. (None known to be edible.) 
Velutini. Pileus silky, etc. 

H. veluti'miS Pers. vellus, a fleece. Velvety. Pileus fleshy, thin,

broad, attached, tapering toward the outer extremity, dark brown tinged 
with red, the edge whitish-beaded. Stem equal, rather slender, hollow, 
fibrillose, subconcolorous, white-mealy and slightly striate at the top.

Quantities of var. leiocephalus grow in the West Virginia forests on Hyphoioma. 
stumps and on the ground from decaying roots. \% in. is the limit of 
its width. Its frequent and dense clusters, its tenderness and deli- 
cacy of flavor make it a favorite.

PileilS thin, convex or subcampanulate, grayish-white, obscurely spotted

Spores brown, elliptical, 8x4-5^. 

Pileus about i in. broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 1.5-2 lines thick. 

At the base of trees and stumps in woods. Alcove. September. 

The cespitose habit and obscurely spotted grayish-white pileus are 
marked features of this species. From H. silvestre the species may be 
distinguished by its smaller size, adnexed or nearly free lamellae which 
have no rosy tint, and by its very cespitose mode of growth. Peck, 
46th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

The caps are oyster-color. Amateurs accustomed to the gayer colors 
of the autumnal Hypholomas will not suspect this of belonging to the 
genus, until the color of the spores is obtained. 

The caps are fine. 

H. lachrymabun'duni Fr. lachryma, a tear. Pileus 2-3 in. broad, 
whitish when young, then dingy-brown, becoming pale around the mar-

hollow, somewhat thickened at the base, scaly with fibrils, becoming 
brownish-whitish. Veil separate, clothed with fibers, hanging from the 
pileus, white. Gills adnate, crowded, 3 lines broad, whitish then 
brownish-purple, edge whitish and distilling drops in wet weather.

Our specimens do not agree in all respects with the published de- 
scription of the species. The pileus is sometimes wholly destitute of 
scales and sometimes densely clothed with hairy, erect ones. The species 
is manifestly variable. Peck, 3Oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

" Like H. fascicularis in quality. Intensely irritant. It is bound with 
the weight of its own guilt." Hay. 

This is a good specimen of Hay's comments. H. fascicularis is never 
irritant, is good eating, is innocent. 

There is irony in the comment of Dr. Cooke: "This doubtful spe- 
cies is used by the smaller ketchup makers." 

I have not seen this species. When I do I shall eat it and expect to 
live. 

APPENDICULA'TI. Pileus hygrophanous, smooth. 

H. incer'tum Pk. (Plate XCVIII.) Pileus fragile, convex or sub- 
campanulate, then expanded, hygrophanous, often radiately wrinkled, 
whitish with the disk yellowish, the thin margin sometimes purplish- 
tinted, often wavy, adorned by fragments of the white flocculent fuga- 
cious veil. Lamellae close, narrow, whitish then rosy-brown, the edge 
often uneven. Stem equal, straight, hollow, easily splitting, whitish 
with a frosty bloom or slightly scurfy at the top. Spores elliptical, 
purplish-brown, 8x5^*. 

Plant gregarious or subcespitose, 2-3 in. high. Pileus 1-2 in. 
broad.' Stem 1-2 lines thick. 

Ground among bushes. Green Island and Sandlake. June and July. 

The veil is sometimes so strongly developed as to form an imperfect 
ring. The color is nearly white from the first. Peck, 2Qth Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

As the name indicates, I was uncertain whether this was a form of H. 
Candolleanum, to which it is very closely related, but as Fries says of 
that "Gills at first violaceous," and as our plant has them at first white 
or whitish, I concluded to risk the uncertainty on a new species. 

I have seen Central Park, New York, well covered with it in May. It 
is also common in the vicinity of Boston. Of very agreeable flavor and 
delicate substance. The profusion of its growth compensates for its 
small size. Macadam.

It differs somewhat in texture from other Hypholomas, being more 
delicate in texture and substance. It is excellent. 

H. suba'qililum Banning. aquilus, brownish, tawny. Pileus brown, 
convex, smooth, hygrophanous, often shaded into ocher at margin, veil 
delicate, silk-like, encircling and covering the marginal extremities of 
the lamellae but forming no ring on the stem. Flesh white, turning 
umber when cut. Lamellae adnexed or nearly free, close, forked, um- 
.ber. Stem cespitose, regular, hollow, silky, white, 2-3 in. long.

H. subaquilum is closely allied to H. appendiculatum, but is dis- 
tinguished by its darker colored cap and gills. 

Its edible qualities are the same. It is among the best.

PSILO'CYBE Fr. 

Gr. naked; head. 



Porphyrosporse 



Pileus more or less fleshy, smooth, margin at first incurved. Gills PsUocybe. 
becoming brownish or purple. Stem somewhat cartilaginous, rigid or 
tough, tubular, hollow or stuffed, often rooting. Veil absent or rudi- 
mentary, never forming a membrane. Spores purple, purple-brown or 
slate-color. 

Generally growing on the ground, gregarious, sometimes cespitose. 

Psilocybe is analogous in form to Collybia, Leptonia and Naucoria, 
which are distinguished by their spore colors. Separated from Psathyra 
by the incurved margin of the pileus. 

But one species of Psilocybe is herein given as edible. Of it, alone, 
the writer has had opportunity to eat meals. Several others of the 
species have been found by him and tested in small quantity. They are 
all of good texture, substance and flavor, though most are small. He 
is of the opinion that increased testing will prove the entire genus edi- 
ble. Nothing can or should be prognosticated about a toadstool, but 
the indications are all in favor of Psilocybe. 

P. spadi'cea Schaeff. spadiceus, date-brown. Pileus thin, submem-

Pellicle which is viscous and separable in wet weather, slightly striate 
chiefly round the margin. Stem as much as 3 in. long, scarcely i line 
thick, tubular and containing a pith, equal, more frequently flexuous, 
smooth, capable of being twisted round the finger, smooth, becoming 
pale; furnished with a veil when young. Gills ascending into the sum- 
mit of the cone, adnexed, almost linear, crowded, becoming purple-

Not common in America, but frequently found. According to M. 
C. Cooke a careful authority P. semilanceata has a dangerous reputa- 
tion. It is said to have proved fatal to children when eaten raw. It is 
not deleterious when cooked. 




Porphyrosporse 



PSA'THYRA Fr. 

Gr. friable. 



Veil none or only universal, and 
floccoso-fibrillose. Stem somewhat 
cartilaginous, fistulose with a tube, 
polished, fragile. PileilS conical or bell- 
shaped, membranaceous , the margin at 
the first straight and adpressed to the 
stem. Gills becoming purple or brown- 
ish. Slender, fragile, hygrophanous. 

Some of the last species of Hypho- 
loma and Psilocybe are very closely 
allied to them. The Coprinarii are 
readily distinguished by the gills being 
white or ash-color, then black, not 
dusky-brown nor becoming purple. 

Psathyra corresponds with Mycena, 
Nolanea, Galera and Psathyrella. All 
the species grow on the ground or on 
trunks. Stevenson. 

But four American species reported.

F. MELANOS'POBJE (spores black). Gr. black; GV. seed. 



'ARIOUS as are the spore colors in this series (in 
its broadest sense), there is an entire absence of 
brown and purple shades in the black spores of four 
of the genera belonging to this group or series. In 
Gomphidius the spores are dingy-olivaceous. It 
is an outsider affiliating with thoroughbreds because 
of more technical congeniality than other genera 
afford. Like comets in the universe, it has no 

home. The singular genus Montagnites (of which but one species has 
been found in America, and that in Texas) has the relationship of 
spore-color. Panaeolus, Anellaria, Psathyrella, when young, have gills 
free from each other; Coprinus, in early life, presents them pressed 
tightly together; as the plants age and the spores ripen, the entire gill 
structure becomes black and dissolves into an inky fluid, the color of 
which is due to the spores. 

The species are all of delicate body, and many of them add gener- 
ously to table luxuries. 



COPRI'NUS Pers. 
Gr. dung. 

Coprinus. Pileus separate from the stem. Gills membranaceous, at first closely 
pressed together, cohering, at length melting into a black fluid. Trama 
obsolete. Spores oval, 1 even, black. 

The extreme closeness of the gills and their entire deliquescence into 
a fluid, black from the spores, sharply define this genus and separate it 
from all others. At first the form is oval or cylindrical; most are 
furnished with a downy or scurfy veil often adhering to the pileus, 
sometimes forming an adhering volva at the base of the stem. Nearly 
all are ephemeral, many completely disappearing in a day. 

Cystidia (sterile cells) of large size are frequent on the gills of many 
species.

CHART OF GENERA ix BLACK-SPORED SERIES MELAXOSPORAE, PAGE 368 



Melanosporae 

The majority grow on richly manured ground or dung, some on rotten Copriuus. 
wood and other materials Bolbitius, the only ally, has the same 
ephemeral existence, and grows in similar situations, but the gills only 
soften (not melting) and the spores are somewhat rust-colored. 

The blackening of the gills is not a process of decay, but is due to 
the growth of the spores, and the plant is still (before deliquescence) 
perfectly edible although not so inviting in appearance as before. 

Species of Coprinus are very common and are easily recognized by 
the deliquescent gills which, when mature, stain the fingers black. 

In "Once upon a Time," when country people made their own writ- 
ing inks, the convenient Coprinus gave its juices for this purpose. A 
little corrosive sublimate added to the boiled and strained fluid pre- 
vented it from molding. 

With few exceptions the species are small. They are tender, of real 
mushroom flavor and highly enjoyable. They make a thin, well flavored 
catsup, but are better used to give flavor to their less favored brethren. 

They stew in from two to fifteen minutes, depending upon the solidity 
of the species. 

ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBES. 

A. PELLICULOSI (pellicula, a thin skin). Page 370. 

Gills covered above with a fleshy or membranaceous skin, hence the 
pileus does not split along the lines of the gills, but becomes lacerated 
with the edges turned upward.

hard rain and often in the most unexpected places. It is a rather do- 
mestic species, usually in troops, but often in clusters of from five to 
fifty individuals. I have seen it lift firmly sodded ground about rail- 
road stations, and again, bulging the surface of gardens like mole-hills. 

There are toadstools of higher flavor, but not one of greater delicacy. 
In this C. comatus is not excelled from its earliest stage until fully 
ripened. It is everywhere commended. 

Lafayette B. Mendel, in American Journal of Physiology, gives the 
following analysis : 

The specimens were freshly gathered and had not yet turned " inky." 
They varied very widely in size, thirty-six mushrooms weighing 1485 
grams, of which 980 grams belonged to the caps (pileus) and 505 
grams to the stems. The average weight of a fresh specimen was thus: 

Pileus 27 grams 

Stem 14 

Total weight 41 

A specimen which had attained the average growth weighed : 

Pileus 43 grams 

Stem 25

otherwise hollow, with spider-web threads within, attenuated upward, 
downy, shining white. Ring not very conspicuous and soon vanishing. 
Gills free, remote, slightly ventricose, at the first somewhat naked and 
remaining long shining white, at length timber-blackish, never becoming 
purple.

It grows singly or in clusters of many individuals on rich ground, 
whether lawns, gardens, gutter sides, or in woods, but not on dung. I

Very variable in size, but clearly distinguished by its snow-white color 
and adnexed gills. Like all of the thin, delicate species of this genus 
there is little substance left after cooking, but the savory flavor is im- 
parted to the cooking medium. 

***** Mica'cei. Pileus at first covered with minute, glistening 

scales, etc. 

C. micaceus (Bull.) Fr. mica, grain, granular. (Plate CIII, fig. 
2, p. 372.) Pileus thin, ovate, then bell-shaped, with the margin 
more or less revolute, wavy, splitting, closely striate, with a few minute 
scales and sparkling atoms, or naked, varying in color from whitish- 
ochraceous to livid-brown, generally darker when moist or old. Gills 
rather narrow, crowded, white then pinkish, finally black. Stem slender, 
fragile, easily splitting, slightly silky, white, hollow, often twisted. 
Plant mostly cespitose.

Common from spring until frost. This is the oval-capped toadstool 
found in clusters about trees, posts, along grassy sides of pavements, pop- 
ping up, Brownie-like, from sodded places. Although small and thin, its

clusters soon fill baskets, and its continuous growth in some places, from Coprinus. 
month to month, year to year, makes it one to be depended upon. 
Stewed for ten minutes it makes a rich, luscious dish. C. congregatus 
closely resembles it and is equally good. 

****** Glabra'ti. Pileus smooth, etc. 

C. deliques'cens (Bull.) Fr. Pileus 3~4 ' n - broad, livid-fuliginous, 
membranaceous, bell-shaped then expanded, smooth, but dotted with 
minute points on the disk, never downy or split, the edge turning up- 
ward and striate, the striae broad but not deep. Stem 4 in. long, 2-4 
lines thick, hollow, with a bark-like covering, equally attenuated up- 
ward, smooth, shining white. Gills free, at length remote from the stem, 
very crowded, flexuous, very narrow, only % line broad, lurid-blackish.

Frequent on stumps and among fallen leaves, sometimes in tufts. 
July to October. 

Spores elliptical, obliquely apiculate, 8x5/1. Massee. 

Sometimes confounded with C. atramentarius. 

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Mcllvaine. 

C. deliquescens is of good size and quality. The stems do not cook 
well with the caps. The flavor is the same as C. atramentarius. 

C. COngrega'tllS (Bull.) Fr. Pileus /-K in. high, cylindrical, then 
bell-shaped, finally expanded and split at the margin, smooth, viscid, 
margin slightly striate, ochraceous. Gills about I line broad, slightly 
adnexed, white, finally becoming black. Stem i^ in. high, equal, 
smooth, hollow, whitish. 

On the ground, also in hot-houses. Massee. 

Readily distinguished by the densely cespitose mode of growth, the 
small size, the viscid, ochraceous, glabrous pileus which remains elon- 
gato-cylindrical for some time, then becomes campanulate and finally 
expands and splits at the margin. 

Densely cespitose, fragile, readily distinguished from C. digitalis by 
its much smaller size. Fries. 

Spores ;x8/x W.G.S.; ioxs/* W.P.

forms are inodorous. The pileus of the long-stemmed form is sometimes 
entirely clear brown, at others grayish with a brownish disk. Stem 
very weak, 5 in. and more in length, I line thick, attenuated at both 
ends. Pileus thin, expanded bell-shaped, about I in. across, when 
young elegantly flocculose, then furrowed, disk livid. Gills rather dis- 
tant.

Melanosporae 



This little Coprinus is a valuable species when found. A patch of it Coprinus. 
about a tree or stump is treasure trove. Patches of it appear in July 
and bear until October. The not-particular observer would mistake it 
for C. micaceus.

C. domesticus is the largest of its sec- 
tion and is sometimes of remarkable growth. I have seen it start from 
under a board in a cellar and prolong its stems for over a foot to get its 
caps to air and light. Under such conditions the stems are twisted in 
a confused mass. 

It is very tender with a decided mushroom flavor. Cook at once.

Of such size and delicate substance as to be of little food value. But 
it has a strong mushroom flavor which is choice as a flavoring. It ap- 
pears during the summer months on dung and dung heaps. It must 
be cooked as soon as gathered.

In the black-spored series Psathy- 
rella is separated by the striate 
pileus, not exceed 1 '^'; the gills, 
Anellaria by the ri.Vg and Coprinus 
by the deliquescent gills. 

Panaeolus, in its entirety, has a 
precise looking membership. If 
the gills were cut from cardboard 
and fixed by machinery, they could 
not be more correct. Some of the 
species are among the earliest ar- 
rivals at toadstool lawn parties, and 
some are the last to leave. Several 
are culinary favorites, notably Pan- 
papilionaceus possesses intoxicating properties. 



P. campanulatus is reported to be a sedative. 

The edible species are easily cooked and are exceptionally delicate 
and well flavored. 

P. retiru'gis Fr. rete, a net; ruga, a wrinkle. Pileus about i in.

Mr. R. K. Macadam, Boston, Mass., informs me that he has infor- 
mation of a case of poisoning by this fungus. "The victim experi- 
enced dizziness, dimness of vision, trembling and loss of power and 
memory. He recovered after simple treatment and was well inside of 
24 hours." 

A full account of this case is in "The London Medical and Surgical 
Journal," Vol. 36, November, 1816. The poison acts as a sedative. 

I have several times eaten of this fungus in small quantities, because 
larger could not be obtained, and with no other than pleasant effect. 
There does not appear to be any case of poisoning reported by it since 
1816, which, considering the inquisitiveness of man, is singular. Caution 
is advised. 

P. papiliona'ceus Fr. papilio, a butterfly. Pileus subhemispherical, 
sometimes subumbonate, smooth, or with the cuticle breaking up into 
scales, whitish-gray, often tinged with yellow. Lamellae very broad, 
attached, becoming black. Stem slender, firm, hollow, pruinose above, 
whitish, sometimes tinged with red or yellow, slightly striate at the top 
and generally stained by the spores. 

Height 3-5 in., breadth of pileus 6-18 lines.

Melanosporse 

On dung and rich soil. Common. May and June. 

A small form occurs with the pileus nearly white, scarcely half an 
inch in diameter, and the cuticle not cracking. Peck, 23d Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

The effects of P. papilionaceus are very uncertain. I have seen it 
produce hilarity in a few instances, and other mild symptoms of intoxi- 
cation, which were soon over, and with little reaction. But I have seen, 
at table, the same effects from eating preserved peaches and preserved 
plums which had fermented. Many personal testings have been with- 
out effect. Testings upon others vary with the individuals. The fungus 
seems to contain a mild stimulant. It is not dangerous, but should be 
eaten with caution. Being of small size, and not a prolific species, 
quantities of it are difficult to obtain. Moderate quantities of it have 
no effect whatever.

In the black-spored series Panaeolus and Anellaria are distinguished 
by their pilei not being striate and Coprinus by its deliquescent gills. 

The species are small and can seldom be gathered in quantity. But 
those tested have the full mushroom flavor and are valued for the flavor 
they give to less gifted species when cooked with them. 

P. gra'cilis Fr. slender. Pileus 3^-1 in. broad, sooty, livid, etc.,

This is allied to A. gracilis Fr., but the 
edge of the gills is not rosy. When dry-

GOMPHI'DIUS Fr. 

A wooden bolt or nail. 

Hymenophore decurrent. Gills distant, composed of a mucilaginous 
membrane, which can be readily separated into two plates, continuous 
at the edge which is acute and powdered with the blackish fusiform 
spores. Veil viscoso-floccose. Fleshy, putrescent, pileus at length the 
shape of an inverted cone. 

A small genus with great difference among the species. Intermediate 
in habit between Cortinarius and Hygrophorus. 

Universal Veil glutinous, at first terminating on the stem in a floccose 
ring soon disappearing. The Gills frequently admit of being detached 
and stretched out into a continuous membrane. Fries. 

A genus possessing several well-marked characters. The very decur- 
rent gills differ from all others in their soft mucilaginous consistency. 
The spores are larger than usual in the Agaricaceae and have the elon- 
gated spindle-shape found in Boleti. The stem and pileus are of the 
same substance, and the pileus and veil are both glutinous when moist. 
The spores have been described as greenish-gray becoming black, and 
as dingy-olive, 

I have had opportunity to see but two species of this small genus 
G. rhodoxanthus and G. viscidus. Of these the spores are decidedly 
olivaceous. If the six other species recorded as found in the United 
States are as creditable, they are well worth hunting for. G. Oregonen- 
sis Pk, is reported as edible and as a valuable food species in Oregon.

Melanosporaa 

The glutinous coatings to pileus and stem do not appear on the Ameri- 
can form of G. rhodoxanthus in the localities I have found it in during 
fifteen years. 



G. glutino'sus (Schaeff.) Fr. glutin, glue. Pileus 2-5 in. broad, 
purple-brown, often mottled with black spots, fleshy, convex, obtuse, 
at length plane, even depressed, even, smooth, very glutinous. Flesh 
thick, about % in., soft, white. Stem 2-3 in. and more long, about 
% in. thick, solid, whitish, thickened and externally and internally 
yellow at the base, viscid with the veil, fibrillose or varying with black 
scales. Cortina often woven in the form of a ring, but soon fugacious. 
Gills deeply decurrent, distant, distinct, branched, quite entire, muci- 
laginous, 3-4 lines broad, at first whitish, then cinereous, clouded with 
the spores. 

Trama none, wherefore the gills easily separate from the pileus. 
Taste watery, moldy. Odor not marked. Stevenson.

G. Oregonen'sis Pk. Pileus at first convex, becoming nearly plane 
or somewhat centrally depressed, viscid, brown or dark-brown, becom- 
ing black in drying, taste sweet and pleasant. Lamellae numerous, 
rather close, adnate or slightly decurrent, blackish in the dried plant. 
Stem short, solid, equal or slightly tapering upward, colored like the 
pileus. Spores oblong, I o-i 2. 5/x. long, 4~5/x broad. 

Pileus 5-10 cm. broad. Stem 2.5-5 cm. long, 4-10 mm. thick.

tion, Gomphidius rhodoxanthus can not be mistaken for any other spe- 
cies. 

It is not common in localities I have frequented, but its presence is 
pretty general in the United States, specimens having been sent to me 
from Georgia, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, etc., and I have found it 
in West Virginia, North Carolina, Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia, 
and other places in Pennsylvania, from July to September, 1898, in- 
clusive. Having enjoyed it in West Virginia in 1882, I was delighted 
to find it in generous quantity at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and to eat many 
meals of it.. Its caps are not excelled by any edible fungus. They 
have solid, delicious substance and rich full flavor. 

The plant is often cespitose. I have never found its cap viscid or 
glutinous. The cooked flesh has the latter consistency. 




MONTAGNITES Fr.

Polyporaceee 



FAMILY II. POLYPORACE^J. 

Hymenophore inferior, facing the ground. Hymenium consisting of 
tubes with poriform mouths which are round or angular, sometimes 
sinuous or torn, lined with 4-spored sporophores and cystidia. 

Fleshy, coriaceous or woody fungi, most abundant and luxuriant 
in warm countries. Intermediate between the Agaricaceae and the 
Hydnaceae, connected with the former by Daedalea and Lenzites, and 
with the latter by Fistulina and Irpex. Fries. 

Within this large family are famed edible species, notably in Boletinus, 
Boletus and Fistulina. In the woody species the razor-strop man finds 
material for his strops (Polyporus celulinus) ; the surgeon styptics; the 
peasant punk to catch sparks from his flint, and the 4th of July urchin 
a fire-holder to light his pyrotechnics. The Chinese have placed some 
species in their fathomless materia medica, while the Polyporus of the 
locust tree is used in America as a medicine for horses. No fungoid 
growth is more universal. They are the ever active pruners of our trees 
and converters of forest debris. They begin the task in Nature's labora- 
tory of changing decaying wood into assimilable shape as food to feed 
the very trees that dropped it. Some are of annual growth, others add 
to their substance year after year, often attaining enormous size. In 
summer and in winter they are ever present objects for interesting study.

descending like a trama among the tubes. Tubes not easily separable 
from the hymenophore and from each other. Stem ringed, hollow. 
Spores pale yellowish. Sylloge, Vol. VI, p. 51. 

Professor Peck has for excellent reasons, given in his Boleti of the 
United States, emended the generic diagnosis of Fries thus : Hyme- 
nium composed of broader radiating lamella connected by very numerous 
more narrow anastomosing branches or partitions and forming large 
angular pores. Tiibes somewhat tenacious, not easily separable from the 
hymenophore and from each other, adnate or subdecurrent, yellowish. 
Professor Peck classifies Boietinus as follows : 

Stem hollow B . cavipes 

Stem solid I 

I . Stem lateral or eccentric B. porosus 

I . Stem central 2 

2. Pileus^pale yellow, silky B. decipiens

Polyporacese 

3 . Pileus red B. paluster Boietmus. 

3. Pileus soon red-squamose B. pictus 

Boleti of the United States, p. 76. 

There are six species given as found in the United States B. cavipes 
Kalchb., B. pictus Pk., B. paluster Pk., B. decipiens Pk., B. porosus 
Pk., B. appendiculatus Pk. of these I have found and eaten four. B. 
decipiens has, at this writing, not been seen by Professor Peck, but 
Professor Farlow, of Harvard, has informed him of authentic specimens. 
There is every probability of its being as edible as the others; a descrip- 
tion of it is, therefore, given. 

In consistency Boletinus is of the best, being rather like that of marsh- 
mallows, and the same as Boletus subaureus. The flavor is mild and 
pleasant. 

Professor Peck mentions that the smell of B. porosus is sometimes 
unpleasant. I have been fortunate in not having had this experience. 

B. ca'vipes Kalchb. Pileus broadly convex, rather tough, flexible, 
soft, subumbonate, fibrillose-scaly, tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with 
reddish or purplish. Flesh yellowish. Tubes slightly decurrent, at first 
pale-yellow, then darker and tinged with green, becoming dingy-ochra- 
ceous with age. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, somewhat 
fibrillose or floccose, slightly ringed, hollow, tawny-brown or yellowish- 
brown, yellowish at the top and marked by the decurrent dissepiments 
of the tubes, white within. Veil whitish, partly adhering to the margin 
of the pileus, soon disappearing. Spores 8-IOX4//.. 

Pileus 1-5-4 in. broad. Stem 1.5-3 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 
Swamps and damp mossy ground under or near tamarack trees. New 
York, Peck; New England, Frost. 

The pileus is clothed with a fibrillose tomentum which becomes more 
or less united into floccose tufts or scales. The umbo is not always 
present and is generally small. The young stem may sometimes be 
stuffed, but, if so, it soon becomes hollow, though the cavity is irregu- 
lar. The freshly shed spores have a greenish-yellow or olivaceous hue, 
but in time they assume a pale or yellowish-ochraceous hue. This spe- 
cies is apparently northern in its range. It loves cold sphagnous 
swamps in mountainous regions. Peck, Boleti of the U. S.

B. pic'tus Pk. Pileus convex or nearly plane, at first covered with a 
red fibrillose tomentum which seon divides into small scales revealing the 
yellow color of the pileus beneath. Flesh yellow, often slowly changing 
to dull pinkish or reddish tints where wounded. Tubes tenacious, at 
first pale yellow, becoming darker or dingy ochraceous with age, some- 
times changing to pinkish-brown where bruised, concealed in the young 
plant by the copious whitish webby veil. Stem equal or nearly so, 
solid, slightly and somewhat evanescently annulate, clothed and colored 
like or a little paler than the pileus, yellowish at the top. Spores 
ochraceous, 9 11x4 5/*.

It is sometimes found upon much decayed chestnut stumps. 

The caps of some species are so cracked as to appear distinctly 
areolate. The white webby veil is often persistent. The fungus is one 
of the handsomest. Its rich variegated colors impress it upon eye-mem- 
ory. It is one of the very best edible species.

BOLETINUS PALUSTER. 

Natural size. (After Peck.) 

Its taste is sweet, smell mild, 



and cooked it is of excellent body and flavor. 

B. deci'piens (B. and C.) Pk. Pileus dry, minutely silky, whitish- 
yellow or pale-buff, flesh buff, one-third in. thick; hymenium plane 
or somewhat concave, yellow, consisting of large, unequal, flexuous 
radiating tubes resembling multiseptate lamellae. Stem equal, solid but 
spongy. Veil floccose, evanescent, adhering for a time to the margin 
of the pileus. Spores rather minute, oblong, ochraceo- ferruginous (rusty 
yellow), 8-10x3.5-4/01. 

Pileus 2 in. broad. Stem 2-2.5 m - l n g> 3-4 l mes thick. 

Thin woods. North and South Carolina. M. A. Curtis. 

Specimens of this species have not been seen by me. The authors 
remark that its affinities are clearly with Boletinus flavidus and its allies, 
from which it is distinguished by its large radiating pores. They also 
say that when dry it is scarcely distinguishable from Paxillus porosus 
Berk., except by its spores. This would imply that its stem is eccen- 
tric or lateral, and I have been informed by Mr. Ravenel that it is some- 
times so. But specimens of this kind, labeled Boletinus decipiens B. 
and C., have been received, which show by their spores that they are 
Paxillus porosus. Besides, Professor Farlow informs me that authentic 
26 401 



Polyporaceae 

Boietinus. specimens of B. decipiens in the Curtisian Herbarium have only central 
stems, from which things I suspect that the two species have been con- 
fused. The spore dimensions here given are derived from a specimen 
in the Curtis Herbarium, through the kindness of Professor Farlow. 
Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

I have not recognized this Boietinus. Its affinities are with excellent 
edible species. 

B. poro'silS (Berk.) Pk. (Plate CXIII.) Pileus fleshy, viscid when 
moist, shining, reddish-brown. Flesh 3-9 lines thick, the margin thin 
and even ; hymenium porous, yellow, formed by radiating lamellae a line 
to half a line distant, branching and connected by numerous irregular 
veins of less prominence and forming large angular pores. Stem lateral, 
tough, diffused into the pileus, reticulated at the top by the decurrent 
walls of the tubes, colored like the pileus. Spores semi-ovate. 

Pileus 2-5 in. broad. Stem 6-1 6 lines long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Var. opa'cus (Paxillus porosus Berk., Bull. N. Y. State Mus. 2, p. 
32). Pileus dry, glabrous or subtomentose, not shining, brown or 
tawny-brown. Spores brownish-ochraceous, 9-nx6-8/A. 

Damp ground in woods and open places. Ohio, Lea, Morgan; North 
Carolina, Curtis; New England, Frost, Farlow ; Wisconsin, Bundy; 
New York, Peck. 

This species is remarkable for its lateral or eccentric stem. There 
is often an emargination in the pileus on the side of the stem which 
gives it a kidney shape. In the typical form it is described as viscid 
when moist, and the Wisconsin plant is also described as viscid, but in 
all the New York specimens that I have seen it is dry and sometimes 
minutely tomentose. I have, therefore, separated these as a variety. 
The color of the pileus varies from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown or 
umber. A disagreeable odor is sometimes present. The tubes are 
rather short and tough and do not easily separate from the hymeno- 
phore and from each other. In the young plant they are not separable. 
They sometimes become slightly blue where wounded. As in other 
species they are pale yellow when young, but become darker or dingy- 
ochraceous with age. The spores have been described as bright yel- 
low, but I do not find them so in the New York plant. The plant is. 
incongruous among the Paxilli by reason of its wholly porous hymenium,

Polyporaceae 

BOLE'TUS Dill. 
Gr. a clod. 




Boletus. ^^^jS^'HE name of a fungus considered a great delicacy 

among the Romans, derived from bolos, a clod, 
probably to denote the round figure of the plant. 
Hymenium wholly composed of small tubes, 
connected together in a stratum, the surface of 
which is dotted with their poriform mouths, and 
which is distinct from the hymenophore on ac- 
count of the latter not descending into a trama. Tubes packed close 
together, .easily separating from the hymenophore and from one another. 
Pores or mouths of the tubes round or angular (in the subgenus Gyrodon 
sinuous or gyroso-plicate). Spores normally fusiform, rarely oval or 
somewhat round. Growing on the ground, fleshy, putrescent, with cen- 
tral stems. Mostly edible, and of importance as articles of food; a few 
poisonous. Fries. 

No American species in Gyrodon. It is therefore omitted in synopsis 
of tribes. C. M. 

This genus abounds in species and is related to Boletinus on one hand 
and to Polyporus on the other. From the latter it is distinguished by 
the absence of a trama and from both by the tubes being easily separa- 
ble from the hymenophore and from each other. Some of the species 
are very variable, others are so closely allied that they appear to almost 
run together. 

The species are generally terrestrial, but B. hemichrysus is habitually 
wood-growing, and others are occasionally so. 

The spores vary so much in color in such closely related species that 
this character is scarcely available for general classification, but it is val- 
uable as a specific character and should always be noted.

Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

C. H. Peck, N. Y. State Botanist, has contributed to Mycological 
literature his careful arrangement and analysis of species of this genus, 
in his "Boleti of the United States." Species of the genus are found in 
every state of the Union. Several species are common to all the states. 
Comprehending, as do the states, all sorts of climates within their vast 
range of latitude, differences in appearance and structure in the same 
species must be expected, dependent largely, as they are in most fungi, 
upon habitat and environment. These variations will frequently sug- 
gest new species. Descriptions which are typical and which can be 
recognized as standard are most desirable. Professor Peck's are ac- 
cepted by the writer as such, that there may be uniformity, and are 
quoted as fully as space will permit. Such variations as are attributa- 
ble to locality will be noted.

Polyporaceee 

Boletus. Since 1882 the writer has given great attention to the edible qualities 
of the Boleti. He is convinced by many personal tests and those made 
by his family and friends, that much, if not all, of the suspicion thrown 
about Boleti is unjust and erroneous. He is able to state positively that 
change of color when bruised or broken ; bitter and pepperiness have 
nothing whatever to do with the edible qualities of species exhibiting 
them, excepting in B. felleus, which exhibits an intense bitter, not lost 
in cooking. It is not poisonous. 

The writer has the courage of his convictions, and has taken interest 
in eating species with a bad reputation whenever opportunity afforded, 
that their just dues might be given them. He has never experienced 
the slightest inconvenience.- But others may not be so fortunate. 

Before cooking Boleti the stem, unless crisp and tender, should be 
removed, as should the tubes unless young and fresh. They broil, fry, 
stew, make good soups and dry well. See recipes. 

It is believed that all species of Boleti up to this time found in 
America are described in this volume. When no remarks of the writer 
follow the descriptions, he has not had an opportunity to test the edible 
quality of the species.

B. specta'bilis Pk. spectabilis, distinguished. Pileus broadly con- 
vex, at first covered with a red to- 
mentum, then scaly, viscid when 
moist, red, the tomentose scales be- 
coming grayish-red, brownish or yel- 
lowish. Flesh whitish or pale-yellow. 
Tubes at first yellow and concealed 
by a reddish glutinous membrane, 
thenochraceous, convex, large, angu- 
lar, adnate. Stem nearly equal, an- 
nulate, yellow above the annulus, red 
or red with yellow stains below. 
Spores purplish-brown , 1315 x6 7/*. 
Pileus 2-5 in. broad. Stem 3-5

Thin woods in swamps. New York, 
Peck; Wisconsin, Btmdy. 

This is a rare and showy species 
which inhabits the cold northern swamps of the country. It probably 
extends into Canada. When cut, the flesh emits a strong, unpleasant 
odor. Wounds of the flesh made by insects or other small animals have 
a bright-yellow color! When young, the tomentose veil covers the 
whole plant, but it soon parts into scales on the pileus and partly or 
wholly disappears from the stem. Peck, Boleti of the U. S.

as if with patches of innate fibrils. Flesh white. Tubes at first whitish, 
becoming dingy or brownish-ochraceous, nearly plane, adnate or slightly 
decurrent, rather large, angular. Stem nearly equal, annulate- whitish 
above the ring, colored like the pileus below, sometimes slightly reticu- 
lated at the top. Spores ferruginous-brown, 10-12x4-5^.

Boletus. B. Clin'tonianus Pk. PileilS convex, very viscid or glutinous, glab- 
rous, soft, shining, golden-yellow, reddish-yellow or chestnut color, the 
margin thin. Flesh pale yellow, becoming less bright or dingy on ex- 
posure to the air. Tubes nearly plane, adnate or subdecurrent, small, 
angular or subrotund, pale-yellow, becoming dingy-ochraceous with 
age, changing to brown or purplish-brown where bruised. Stem equal 
or slightly thickened toward the base, straight or flexuous, yellow at the 
top, reddish or reddish-brown below the annulus, sometimes varied with 
yellow stains, the annulus white or yellow, persistent, forming a thick 
band about the stem. Spores brownish-ochraceous , I 0-11x4-5^. 

Pileus 2-5 in. broad. Stem 2-5 in. long, 4-9 lines thick. 

Mossy or grassy ground in woods or open places, especially under or 
near tamarack trees. New York, Peck; New England, Frost. 

This is apparently closely related to B. elegans, from which it differs 
in its thick persistent ring, in its stem which is not at all dotted and in 
its longer and darker-colored spores. Its smaller tube's and persistent 
ring separate it also from B. flavus. In the typical form the pileus is 
bay-red or chestnut color, but plants growing in open places generally 
have it yellowish or reddrsh-yellow. It is mild to the taste and I have 
eaten it sparingly. It sometimes grows in tufts. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. inflex'us Pk. curving. PileilS convex, glabrous, viscid, yellow, 
often red or reddish on the disk, the margin thin, inflexed, concealing 
the marginal tubes. Flesh whitish, not changing color where wounded. 
Tubes rather long, adnate, yellowish, becoming dingy-yellow with age, 
the mouths small, dotted with reddish glandules. Stem rather slender, 
not ringed, solid, viscid, dotted with livid-yellow glandules. Spores 
yellowish, 10 12x4 5/*. 

Pileus about i in. broad. Stem about 2 in. long, 2-4 lines thick. 

Open woods. Trexlertown. September. Herbst. 

This Boletus belongs to the tribe Viscipelles. It is remarkable for and 
easily recognized by the inflexed margin of the pileus, which imitates to 
some extent the appendiculate veil of Boletus versipellis. It sometimes 
grows in tufts. The paper in which fresh specimens were wrapped was 
stained yellow. Boletus Braunii Bres. has an inflexed margin, but that 
is a much larger plant with a yellowish-brown pileus, a fibrillose stem 
and much smaller spores. Peek, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 22, No. 5.

IOX3-4/X. 

Pileus 2-5 in. broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 6-10 lines thick. 

Woods. Minnesota, Johnson; Wisconsin, Bundy. 

This is apparently a rare species in this country. I have not seen it. 
It is said to resemble B. luteus, from which it is separated by the large 
angular mouths of the tubes. In British Fungi the spores are described 
as "spindle-shaped, yellowish-brown;" in Sylloge, as "ovoid-oblong, 
acute at the base, granulose, pale ochraceous." Peck, Boleti of the 
U. S. 

B. fistulo'silS Pk. Pileus convex, viscid, glabrous, yellow, the 
margin at first incurved or involute. Flesh yellow. Tubes plane or 
subventricose, medium size, round with thin walls, adnate or sometimes 
depressed around the stem, yellow. Stem rather slender, subequal, 
viscid, glabrous, hollow, yellow, with a white mycelioid tomentum at 
the base. Spores elliptical, 13x6^. 

Pileus about i in. broad. Stem 2-'4 in. long, about 3 lines thick. 

Grassy woods. Auburn, Ala. July. Underwood. 

A small but pretty species of a yellow color throughout. It is re- 
markable for its hollow stem, which is suggestive of the specific name. 
It is referable to the tribe Viscipelles. Pefk, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, 
Vol. 24, No. 3. 

B. sphseros'porus Pk. globose-spored. (Bulletin Torrey Botanical 
Club, Vol. XII.) Pileus at first hemispherical, then convex, glabrous, 
viscid, creamy-yellow, becoming reddish-brown or chestnut color with 
age. Flesh pale yellowish-brown. Tubes adnate or slightly decur- 
rent, large, angular, pale-yellow, becoming brown, sometimes tinged 
with green. Stem stout, equal, even or slightly reticulated at the top, 
the membranous anmilus persistent, sometimes partly adhering to the 
margin of the pileus. Spores globose or broadly elliptical, 8~9/* long.

PileuS 2-5 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 6-10 lines thick. 

Pine woods and groves. New York, Peck. 

B. luteus has an international reputation for edibility. I have found it 
at Waretown and Haddonfield, N. J. ; in Bartram's Garden, West Phila- 
delphia, always under pines. At Waretown it was gregarious. Pine 
needles, sand, anything through which it grows, adheres to the glutin- 
ous cap. It must be carefully cleaned before cooking. It is then of 
choice consistency and good flavor.

Polyporaceae 

Sandy soil in pine woods. New York, Peck, Clinton; New England, 
Frost. 

The species is closely related to B. luteus, from which it differs in its 
smaller size, more slender stem and glutinous collapsing veil. Peck, 
Boleti of the U. S. 

Found at Waretown, N. J., 1887, under pines and in same locality 
as B. luteus, for which it can be readily mistaken. It is usually covered 
with adherent sand or pine needles. Its flesh is tender with a pleasant 
glutinosity. Flavor good. 

B. fla'vidllS Fr. light yellowish. PiletlS thin, gibbous, then plane, 
viscose, livid, yellowish. Flesh pallid. Tubes decurrent, with large

Pine woods and swamps. Pennsylvania, Schweinitz; North Carolina, 
Curtis; New England, Frost; California, H. and M.; Rhode Island,

Fries says that this species is more slender than its allies, and differs 
from them all in its merely glutinous veil. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Dr. Curtis, of North Carolina, places it among edible species. 

Many specimens were found by the writer near Waretown and Had- 
donfield, N. J., and a few at Mt. Gretna, Pa. The stems are thin and 
slightly spreading at the top. They are hard. The caps are excellent. 

B. America'llUS Pk. Pileus thin, convex or nearly plane, sometimes 
umbonate, soft, very viscid or glutinous when moist, slightly tomentose 
on the margin when young, soon glabrous or the margin sometimes 
remaining scaly, rarely scale-spotted from the drying of the gluten, 
yellow, becoming dingy or less bright with age, sometimes vaguely 
dotted or streaked with bright red. Flesh pale-yellow, less clear or 
pinkish-gray on exposure to the air. Tubes plane or convex, adnate, 
rather large, angular, pale-yellow, becoming sordid-ochraceous. Stem 
slender, equal or slightly tapering upward, firm, not at all annulate, 
yellow, often pallid or brownish toward the base, marked with numerous 
brown or reddish-brown persistent glandular dots, yellow within. Spores 
oblong or subfusiform, ochraceo-ferruginous, 91 1x4 5^.

Thin woods and open places. New York, Peck; North Carolina, C. 
J. Curtis; Massachusetts, Mississippi, G. Survey (Rep. 51). 

This plant might almost be considered a stout variety of the preced- 
ing, but in addition to its thicker pileus and stouter stem, it has smaller 
tubes of a clearer yellow color, and the exuding drops are yellow, not 
whitish, as in that species. In habit it appears more like B. granulatus, 
from which it is distinct in color. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

From early October, through heavy frosts and until long after No- 
vember snows I found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in 18971898. 
Specimens were sent to Professor Peck and identified as this species. It 
grew in grass on borders of woods, or gravelly ground, sometimes 
among pine needles. Large troops of it were frequent, and tufts con- 
taining many individuals were common. 

I regard B. subaureus as among the most valuable of our food species. 
Its plentifulness, lateness, excellent quality will commend it to all My- 
cophagists. It can be cooked in any way. The tubes need not be re- 
moved. 

B. hirtel'lus Pk. slightly hairy. Pileus broadly convex, soft,

the darker, more brown color of the spores. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. punc'tipes Pk. punctum, a dot; pes, a foot. Pileus convex or 
nearly plane, glutinous when moist, yellow, the thin margin at first 
minutely grayish-pulverulent, becoming recurved with age. Tubes 
short, nearly plane, adnate, small, subrotund, at first brownish, then 
sordid-ochraceous. Stem rather long, tapering ifpward, grandular- 
dotted, rhubarb-yellow. Spores 9 10x4-5;*. 

Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 3-5 lines thick. Mixed

occur also on the tubes. The species is rare. Peck, Boleti of the 
U. S. 

Not seen by Professor Peck since its discovery in 1878.

Polyporaceee 

Boletus. B. granula'tllS granula, a granule. PileuS convex or nearly 
plane, very viscid or glutinous and rusty-brown when moist, yellowish 
when dry. Flesh pale-yellowish. Tubes short, adnate, yellowish, 
their mouths simple, granulated. Stem dotted with glandules above* 
pale-yellowish. Spores spindle-shaped, yellowish-orange, /.5-IOX2-3/X,. 

PileuS 1.5-4 m - broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Woods, especially of pine and in open places under or near pine 
trees. Very common. 

The plant is generally gregarious and sometimes grows in circles, 
whence the name B. circinans Pers. Occasionally it is cespitose. The pi- 
leus is very variable in color pinkish-gray, reddish-brown, yellowish- 
gray, tawny-ferruginous or brownish and is sometimes obscurely spot- 
ted by the drying gluten. The flesh is rather thick and often almost 
white, except near the tubes, where it is tinged with yellow. The tubes 
are small, at first almost white or very pale-yellow, but they become 
dingy-ochraceous with age. The stem is generally short, stout and 
firm, whitish-pallid or yellowish, and often dotted to the base, though 
the glandules are more numerous and distinct on the upper part. Peck, 
Boleti of the U. S. 

B. granulatus is of frequent and general occurrence. I have found it 
in the pine woods of New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and 
West Virginia, and in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in mixed woods. 

It is a late-growing species, appearing in September and continuing 
until frost. 

All authors, with one exception (Gillet), give the species as edible. 
From frequent and copious testings, the writer vouches for its edibility 
and excellence. It bears favorable comparison with any of the late 
Boleti. 

B, bre'vipes Pk. brevis, short; pes, foot. Pfleus thick, convex, 
covered with a thick, tough gluten when young or moist, dark chestnut 
color, sometimes fading to dingy-tawny, the margin inflexed. Flesh 
white or tinged with yellow. Tubes short, nearly plane, adnate or 
slightly depressed around the stem, small, subrotund, at first whitish 
becoming dingy-ochraceous. Stem whitish, not dotted or rarely with a 
few very minute inconspicuous dots at the apex, very short. Spores sub- 
fusiform, 7.5x3//..

Polyporaceee 

Sandy soil in pine groves and woods. New England, Frost; New Boletus. 
York, Peck. 

The species is closely related to B. granulatus, from which it differs 
especially in its darker colored pileus, more copious gluten, shorter 
stem and the almost entire absence of granules from the tube mouths 
and stem. In the rare instances in which these are present they are ex- 
tremely minute and inconspicuous. The plant occurs very late in the 
season and the pileus appears as if enveloped in slime and resting stem- 
less on the ground. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Specimens found in pine woods of New Jersey, identified by Professor 
Peck. Lambertville, N. J., C. S. Ridgway; Haddonfield, N. J., T. 
J. Collins; Pleasantville, Isaac F. Shaner. 

B. brevipes is a disreputable, dirty, tramp-looking fungus, from which 
the collector would expect no good. Nevertheless, when it has had a 
good scrubbing it becomes respectable and is sweet, tender, good eat- 
ing. When other species abound, it does not pay for the cleansing. 

B. COllilli'tllS Fr. collino, to besmear. Pileus convex, even, becom- 
ing pale when the brown gluten separates. Flesh white. Tubes adnate, 
elongated, naked, the mouths two-parted, pallid, becoming yellow. 
Stem firm, often tapering downward, somewhat reticulate with appressed 
squamules, white, becoming brown. 

Woods of pine or fir. North Carolina, Curtis/ New England, Frost. 

I have seen no specimens of this apparently rare species. It is said 
to be solitary in its mode of growth and to resemble B. luteus in size 
and color, but to be distinct from it by its ringless, dotless stem. Dr*. 
Curtis records it as edible. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

I found three specimens at Haddonfield, N. J., October, 1897, under 
scrub pines. Cap 2;^ in. across, convex, gibbous; stem equal, 2% in. 
long, K in. in diameter, slightly tapering at base. The two-parted 
mouths to the tubes were very distinct. The stems were tough, but the 
caps, washed and fried, were good. 

B. di'chrous Ellis. Pileus convex, viscose, dull red. Flesh soft, 
dull, yellowish-white, changing to greenish-blue where wounded, finally 
yellow. Tubes subdepressed around the stem, large, unequal, straw-

In the American plant the spores are 10-1 2x4-5^. 

Cordier classes it among the edible species. Peck, Boleti of the 
United States. 

B. mi'tis Krombh. mild. Pileus convex, then plane or depressed, 
firm, viscid, yellowish-flesh color, reddish-rust color when dry. Flesh 
pale, grayish-yellow. Tubes short, olivaceous or golden-yellow, their 
mouths compound, angular, unequal. Stem firm, short, even, narrbwed 
toward the base, colored like the pileus. Spores 1214x41*. 

Pileus 2-2*. 5 in. broad. Stem 2-2.5 in. long. 

Mixed woods. New England, Frost. 

This species is unknown to me and is recorded by Mr. Frost only. 
Peck, Bol.eti of the United States. 

B. uni'color Frost MS. Pileus broadly convex or nearly plane, vis- 
cid when moist, even, sometimes streaked as if with minute innate brown 
fibrils, pale-yellow. Flesh pale-yellow. Tubes adnate or slightly de- 
current, rather short, compound, lemon-yellow, becoming darker with 
age. Stem even, equal or narrowed toward the base, colored like the 
pileus. Spores reddish-yellow, 9-11x4^1. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad . Stem 2 in. long, 4-6 lines thick.

Polyporaceas 

Pine woods and open sedgy places. New England, Frost. Boletus. 

Specimens not seen. The species seems too near B. bovinus, of 
which it may possibly be a variety, but its yellow flesh and the colors 
ascribed to the tubes and spores require its separation. Rev. C. J. 
Curtis sends notes of a species found by him in North Carolina, which 
agree with this in its characters so far as noted. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

B. ignora'tus Pk. PileuS convex, viscid, bright lemon-color, marked 
with wrinkled lines of orange color, which are distributed over the pi- 
leus, giving it a streaked appearance. Flesh white, solid, does not 
change color when cut or broken; taste slightly acid. Pores lemon- 
color, moderately large, free, connected with the stem by web-like fila- 
ments. Stem larger at the apex, somewhat tapering toward the base, 
yellow, smooth, solid. Spores 4.5xn/>t. 

This closely approaches Boletus unicolor Fr., from which it scarcely 
differs except in its white flesh and free tubes. Fungi of Maryland, 
Mary E. Banning. Peck, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

B. bovi'nus bos, an ox. PileuS nearly plane, glabrous, viscid, pale 
yellow. Flesh white. Tubes very short, subdecurrent, their mouths 
compound, pale yellow or grayish, becoming rust-colored. Stem equal, 
even, colored like the pileus. Spores fusiform, dingy greenish-ocher, 
7.5-10x3-4,*. 

Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 1.5-2 in. long, sometimes cespitose. 

Pine woods. North Carolina, Schweinitz, Curtis; Pennsylvania, 
Schweinitz; New England, Frost, Palmer, Bennett, Sprague, Farlow; 
California, H ' . and M . 

The shallow tubes, 2-3 lines long, are said to resemble the pores of 
Merulius lacrymans. The species is recorded edible by Curtis, Gillet 
and Palmer. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

West Virginia mountains under hemlocks, 1882-1885, and near Had- 
donfield, N. J., under pines. Mcllvaine, 1892. Gregarious and in 
clusters. The pore surface was in some specimens broadly wrinkled. 

Smell and taste pleasant. Cooked, the quality is of the best in Boleti. 

B. rubinel'lus Pk. dim. of ruber, red. Pileus broadly conical or 
convex, viscid when moist, subtomentose or slightly pubescent when 
dry, red fading to yellow on the margin. Flesh whitish or yellowish,

Polyporaceee 

Boletus, taste mild. Tubes adnate or slightly depressed around the stem, dingy- 
reddish, becoming subferruginous. Stem equal, slender, even, colored 
like the tubes, yeflow witJiin, sometimes yellow at the base. Spores 
oblong-fusiform, ferruginous-brown, 12.5 1 5x4^. 

PileilS 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 1-3 lines thick. 
Mixed woods or under or near coniferous trees in open places. New 
York, Peck. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. pipera'tus Bull. piper, pepper. PileilS convex or nearly plane, 
glabrous, slightly viscid when moist, yellowish, cinnamon or siibferm- 
ginous. Flesh white or yellowish, taste acrid, peppery . Tubes rather 
long and large, angular, often unequal, plane or convex, adnate or sub- 
decurrent, reddish-rust color. Stem slender, subequal, tawny-yellow, 
bright yellow at the base. Spores subfusiform, ferruginous-brown, 
9-1 IX4/M. 

Pileus 1-3 in. broad. Stem 1.5-3 m - l n g, 2 ~4 l mes thick. 

Woods and open places. Common and variable. 

This species may easily be recognized by its peppery flavor. The 
pileus sometimes appears as if slightly tomentose, and both this and the 
preceding species recede from the character of the tribe by the slight 
viscidity of the pileus. This is sometimes cracked into areas and some- 
times the margin is very obtuse by the elongation of the tubes. Peck, 
Boleti of the U. S. 

Haddonfield, N. J., 1892. Mcllvaine. 

This fungus is reckoned poisonous by Stevenson. Massee gives its 
taste as very hot. The taste of the American plant is peppery but not 
offensively so. This pepperiness it loses in cooking. It has been eaten 
by the writer and his friends with enjoyment and without any discom- 
fort. 

B. subsanguin'eus Pk. sub and sangttineus, bloody. (Plate CXVI, 
fig. 4, p. 420.) PileilS convex or slightly depressed in the center, gla- 
brous, viscid, bright-red or scarlet. Flesh thick, firm but flexible, white, 
slowly changing to a pale brownish-lilac on exposure to the air, taste 
slightly bitter. Tubes very short, 24 mm. long, adnate, but often sep- 
arating from the stem with the expansion of the pileus, reddish, the 
mouths minute, stuffed at first, pinkish, then brownish-yellow, changing 
to a light-brown where wounded. Stem short, thick, uneven, often

PileuS 2.5-10 cm. broad. Stem 2.5-5 cm - l n g> 2-4 cm. thick. 

Solitary, gregarious or cespitose. Under beech trees. West Phila- 
delphia, Pa. August. C. Mcllvaine. 

This is a very showy species, easily recognized by its bright-red vis- 
cid pileus and its short, thick and uneven or somewhat lacunose stem. 
It is closely related to the European B. sanguineus With., from which 
it is separated by its minute tubes, its uneven stem and the brownish 
hues assumed where wounded. 

The spore characters of this and the four succeeding species are un- 
known, but the other characters are quite distinctive and apparently 
sufficient for the recognition of the species. The descriptions have been 
derived from colored figures and other data furnished by Mr. Mcllvaine, 
who says all are edible. Peck, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No. 27. 

When slowly stewed for thirty minutes, there is no better Boletus. 

PULVERULENTI. 

Pileus clothed with a yellow dust or a yellow powdery down. Stem 
more or less yellow powdered, neither bulbous nor distinctly reticulated. 

The species which constitute this tribe are easily distinguished from 
all others by the sulphur-colored pulverulence which coats the pileus 
and stem like a universal veil. They appear thus far to be peculiar to 
this country. Though strongly resembling each other in the tribal 
character they are very diverse in other respects. One species, by its 
viscidity, connects with the preceding tribe; another by its differently 
colored tube mouths is related to the Luridi ; and the third is peculiar 
in its ligneous habitat.

South Carolina, Ravenel; North Carolina, Curtis; New York, Peck. 

The species is remarkable for its habitat, which is lignicolous. The 
New York variety grew on a stump of white pine. By its eccentric 
stem it connects this genus with Boletinus, through Boletinus porosus. 
According to the authors of this species it resembles Boletus variegatus. 
Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. Kavenel'ii B. and C. after Ravenel. Pileus convex or nearly 
plane, slightly viscid when young or moist, covered with a sulphur-yel- 
low powdery down, becoming naked and dull-red on the disk. Flesh 
whitish. Tubes at first plane, adnate, pale-yellow, becoming yellowish- 
brown or umber, dingy-greenish where bruised, the mouths large or 
medium size, subrotund. Stem nearly equal, clothed and colored like 
the young pileus, yellow within, with a slight evanescent webby or 
tomentose ring. Spores ochraceous-brown, io-i2x5-6/M. 

Pileus 1-3 in. broad. Stem 1.5-4 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods and copses. South Carolina, Ravenel; North Carolina, Curtis; 
New York, Peck; New England, Frost. 

This is a very distinct and very beautiful species. Mr. Ravenel re- 
marks in his notes that "this plant is not infested by larvae and preserves 
more constant characters than any other Boletus with which I am ac- 
quainted." The webby powdered filaments constitute a universal veil 
which at first covers the whole plant and conceals the young tubes. As 
the pileus expands this generally disappears from the disk, and, sep- 
arating between the margin and the stem, a part adheres to each. The 
flesh is sometimes stained with yellow. The tubes in some instances be- 
come convex and slightly depressed around the stem. They are almost 
white when young, and often exhibit brownish hues where wounded. 

422 



Polyporaceae 

The plant is sometimes cespitose. I have observed a greenish tint to Boletus, 
the freshly shed spores, but it soon disappears. Boletus subchromeus 
Frost Ms. is this species. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. auriflam'meus B. and C. flaming yellow. Pileus convex, dry, 
powdered, bright golden-yellow. Flesh white, unchangeable. Tubes 
plane or convex, free, yellow, their broad angular mouths scarlet. Stem 
slightly tapering upward, powdered, colored like the pileus. Spores 
10-12.5x5/4. 

Pileus 8-12 lines broad. Stem 1-1.5 in. long. 

Woods. North Carolina, Curtis; New York, Peck. 

This is evidently a rare species and as beautiful as it is rare. The 
whole plant is bright-yellow except the tube mouths, and is sprinkled 
with yellow dust or minute yellow branny particles. In the New York 
specimen the scarlet color is wanting in the marginal tube mouths and 
the stem is marked with fine subreticulating elevated lines. In other 
respects it agrees well with the diagnosis of the species. Peck, Boleti 
of the U. S. 

SUBPRUINOSI sub, pruina, hoar frost. 

Pileus glabrous, but more often pruinose. Tubes adnate, yellowish. 
Stem equal, even, neither bulbous nor reticulated. 

The species of this tribe have the pileus neither viscid nor distinctly 
and permanently tomentose. Typically it is glabrous or merely pruinose, 
but Fries has admitted into the group one species with a pulverulent, 
and one with a silky pileus. The species are not sharply distinguished 
from those of the following tribes, and possibly some have been admitted 
here which might as well have been placed there. Some of the species 
are variable in color and their characters are not sufficiently well known.

B. minia'tO-oliva'ceilS Frost olive-red. Pileus at first convex and 
firm, then nearly plane, soft and spongy, glabrous, vermilion, becom- 
ing olivaceous. Flesh pale-yellow, changing to blue where wounded. 
Tubes bright lemon-yellow, adnate or subdecurrent. Stem glabrous, 
enlarged at the top, pale-yellow, brighter within, sometimes lurid at the 
base. Spores 12.5x6^. 

Var. sensi'bilis (Boletus sensibilis Rep. 32, p. 33). 

Pileus at first pruinose-tomentose, red, becoming glabrous and ochra- 
ceous-red with age. Tubes bright-yellow tinged with green, becoming 
sordid-yellow. Stem lemon-yellow with red or rhubarb stains at the 
base, contracted at the top when young, subcespitose. Spores 10-12.5 
x4-5^. 

Pileus 2-6 in. broad. Stem 3-4 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods and their borders. New England, Frost ; New York, Peck. 

Though the sensitive Boletus differs considerably in some respects 
from the olive-red Boletus, it is probably only a variety, and as such I 
have subjoined it here. In it every part of the plant quickly changes 
to blue where wounded, and even the pressure of the fingers in handling 
the fresh specimens is sufficient to induce this change of color. I have 
not found the typical plant in New York, but specimens received from 
Mr. Frost are not, in the dry state, distinguishable from the variety.

have eaten it, and continue to do so. Yet Professor Peck (48th Rep., Boletus, 
p. 202) reports a case brought to his notice of an entire family being 
sickened by eating B. sensibilis. All recovered. It may, therefore, be 
one of those species which, while disagreeing with some persons, can 
be eaten by the majority. Clitocybe illudens, Lepiota Morgani and 
others of the Agaricaceae are such species. 

B. bi'color Pk. two-color. (Plate CXVII, figs. I, 2, p. 424.) Pi- 
leus convex, glabrous or merely pruinose-tomentose, dark-red, firm, be- 
coming soft, paler and sometimes spotted or stained with yellow when 
old. Flesh yellow, not at all or but slightly and slowly changing to 
blue where wounded. Tubes nearly plane, adnate, bright-yellow, be- 
coming ochraceous, slowly changing to blue where wounded, their 
mouths small, angular or subrotund. Stem subequal, firm, solid, red, 
generally yellow at the top,. Spores pale,- ochraceous-brown, 10 
12.5x4-5/4. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 1-3 in. long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Woods and open places. New York, Peck; Wisconsin, Bundy. 

The color of this plant is somewhat variable. In the typical form the 
pileus and stem are dark red, approaching Indian red, but when old the 
color of the pileus fades and is often intermingled with yellow. The 
surface sometimes cracks and becomes cracked in areas. From the 
European B. Barlae this species is separated by its solid stem; from B. 
versicolor by its small tube mouths and its red stem. Peck, Boleti of 
the U. S. 

Plentiful at Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, August, September, 1898, in 
mixed woods. Very variable in shape and color. Identified by Pro- 
fessor Peck from painting and description. 

Fine eating, one of the very best. 

B. glabel'lllS Pk. smooth. PileilS fleshy, thick, broadly convex or 
nearly plane, soft, dry, subglabrous, smoky-buff. Flesh white, both it 
and the tubes changing to blue where wounded. Tubes nearly plane, 
adnate, ochraceous, tinged with green, their mouths small, subrotund. 
Stem subequal, glabrous, even, reddish toward the base, pallid above, 
with a narrow reddish circumscribing zone or line at the top. Spores 
oblong, brownish-ochraceous, tinged with green when fresh, 10-12. 5x4^. 

PileilS 3-5 in. broad. Stem 1-3 in. long, 5-10 lines thick. 

425 



Polyporacese 

Boletus. Grassy ground under oaks. New York, Peck. 

The species is well marked by the reddish band or line on the stem 
just below the tubes, but this disappears in drying. Peck, Boleti of 
the U. S. 

B. aluta'ceilS Morgan yellowish. PileuS cushion-shaped, glabrous, 
ahitaceous with a tinge of red. Flesh white, inclining to reddish. Tubes 
semifree, medium in size, unequal, angular, greenish-yellow. Stem 
nearly equal, striate, reticulate at the apex, colored like the pileus. 
Spores fusiform, brownish-olive, 12.5x5^. 

Pileus 3 in. broad. 

Rocky woods of oak and chestnut. Kentucky, Morgan. 

The general aspect of the figure of this species recalls some of the 
forms of Boletus subtomentosus. The tubes are nearly equal in length 
to the thickness of the flesh of the pileus. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Quite frequent at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in mixed woods, principally oak 
and chestnut. 

Stem should be removed, and tubes when old. It cooks well and is 
especially good. 

B. tenui'culus Frost thin. Pileus nearly plane, thin, lurid-red on 
a yellow ground. Flesh unchangeable. Tubes short, adnate, small, 
golden-yellow. Stem slender, equal, colored like the pileus. Spores 
iox6ju.. 

Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem 4-6 in. long. 

Woods. New England. Frost. 

The thin pileus and long slender stem readily distinguish this species. 
Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. auri'porus Pk. golden-pore. Pileus convex or nearly plane, 
glabrous or merely pruinose-tomentose, grayish-brown, yellowish-brown, 
or reddish-brown. Flesh white, unchangeable. Tubes plane or slightly 
depressed around the stem, adnate or subdecurrent, bright golden-yel- 
low, retaining their color when dried. Stem equal or slightly thickened 
at the base, viscid or glutinous when moist, especially toward the base, 
colored like or a little paler than the pileus. Spores 7-5- IOX 4~5/*- 

Pileus 1-3 in. broad. Stem 1-3 in. long, 2-4 lines thick.

Polyporacese 

Thin woods and shaded banks. New York, Peck; New England, Boletus. 
Frost. 

This species is remarkable for the rich yellow color of the tubes, 
which is retained unchanged in the dried specimens, and for the viscid 
stem. This character, however, is not noticeable in dry weather and 
was overlooked in the original specimens. 

Boletus glutinipes Frost Ms. is not distinct. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Hopkins' Woods, Haddonfield, N. J. Grassy oak woods. 1891

The caps are delicious. 

B. innix'us Frost. Pileus convex or nearly plane, glabrous, yellow- 
ish-brown, slightly cracked in areas when old, yellow in the interstices. 
Flesh white. Tubes adnate, lemon-yellow, unchangeable. Stem slen- 
der, short, much thickened at the base in large specimens, yellowish, 
streaked with brown, brownish within. Spores iOx5/x,. 

Grassy woods. New England. Frost. 

The whole plant often reclines as if for support, Peck, Boleti of the 
U. S. 

B. parasi'ticus Bull. a parasite. Pileus convex or nearly plane, dry, 
silky, becoming glabrous, soon tessellately cracked, grayish or dingy- 
yellow. Tubes decurrent, medium size, golden yellow. Stem equal, 
rigid, incurved, yellow without and within. Spores oblong-fusiform, 
pale-brown, 12.5-15x4^. 

Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 2-4 lines thick. 

Parasitic on species of Scleroderma. New York, Gerard; New Eng- 
land, Sprague, Bennett. 

This species is very rare in this country. It is remarkable for its 
peculiar habitat. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

New York, Lydia M . Patchen; Westfield, on Scleroderma vulgare. 

I found many specimens of this rare species during August, 1897, 
growing on Scleroderma vulgare. 

Professor Peck, to whom I sent specimens, identified them as B. par- 
asiticus. The tubes were large, unequal, dissepiments thin, decurrent. 
The Sclerodermas frequently appear to be parasitic upon the Boletus. 
I have seen the host' plant thrown entirely free from the ground by the 
Boletus. 

427 



Polyporaceae 
Boletus. B. parasiticus is edible, but it is not of agreeable flavor. 

B. dictyocepll'alus Pk. reticulate. Pileus convex, glabrous, reticu- 
late with brown lines beneatJi the thin separable cuticle , brownish-orange, 
darker in the center and there tinged with pink. Flesh white, un- 
changeable. Tubes nearly plane, slightly depressed around the stem, 
grayish-yellow, becoming brown where bruised. Stem equal or slightly 
tapering at the top, solid, rimose, dotted with scales, lemon-yellow, 
darker toward the base. Spores 15 2Ox6/u.. 

Pileus 2.5 in. broad. Stem 3-4 in. long, 5-6 lines thick. 

Mixed woods. North Carolina. C. J. Curtis. 

The description here given has been derived from a single dried speci- 
men and from the notes kindly sent by Mr. Curtis. The species is 
apparently well marked and very distinct by the peculiar reticulations of 
the pileus. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. subgla'bripes Pk. rather smooth. Pileus convex or nearly 
plane, glabrous, reddish inclining to chestnut color. Flesh white, un- 
changeable. Tubes adnate, nearly plane in the mass, pale yellow, be- 
coming convex and darker or greenish-yellow with age, the mouths 
small, subrotund. Stem equal, solid, scurfy, pale yellow. Spores 
oblong-fusiform, 12.5-15x4-5^. 

The smoothish-stemmed Boletus is well marked by its cylindric mi- 
nutely scurfy stem which is colored like the tubes. Its cap is smooth 
and nearly always some shade of red or L 'Specimens occur occa- 
sionally in which it approaches grayish-bro\,,i or ,y oc, 1-brown . The 
flesh is white and unchangeable when cut or bro! \, 

The tubes at first have a nearly plane surface, but this becomes some- 
what convex with age, and slightly depressed around the stem. The 
tube mouths are small and nearly round. The color of the tubes is at 
first a beautiful pale yellow, but it becomes darker or slightly greenish- 
yellow with age. 

The stem is colored very nearly like the tubes, but sometimes it has 
a slight reddish tint toward the base. Its peculiar feature consists of 
the minute, branny particles upon it. They are so small and pale that 
they are easily overlooked. 

There is a variety in which the cap is corrugated or irregularly pitted 
and wrinkled. Its name is Boletus subglabripes corrugis Pk. 

428 



Polyporaceae 


The cap is 1^-4 in. broad, the stem is 2-3 in. long and 4-8 lines Boletus,

B. pal'lidus Frost pale. (Plate CXVII, fig. 4, p. 424.) Pileus 
convex, becoming plane or centrally depressed, soft, glabrous, pallid or 
brownish-white, sometimes tinged with red. Flesh white. Tubes 
plane or slightly depressed around the stem, nearly adnate, very pale or 
whitish-yellow, becoming darker with age, changing to blue where 
wounded, the mouths small. Stem equal or slightly thickened toward 
the base, rather long, glabrous, often flexuous, whitish, sometimes 
streaked with brown, often tinged with red within. Spores pale ochra- 
ceous-brown, io-i2x5-6/x. 

PileilS 2-4 in. broad. Stem 3~5 lines long, 4-8 lines thick. 

Woods. New England, Frost; New York, Peck. 

The species is readily recognized by its dull pale color, rather long 
stem, and tubes changing to blue where wounded. Peck, Boleti of the 
U. S. 

Common in West Virginia mountains, Angora, West Philadelphia, 
Mt. Gretna, Pa. Solitary, on ground in mixed woods. 

The caps are tender and delicately flavored. 

B. rubropunc'tus Pk. red-dotted. (Plate CXVII, fig. 3, p. 424.) 
Pileus convex, glabrous, re 1 dish-brown. Flesh yellowish, unchange- 
able. Tubes nearl" i ' , depressed about the stem, their mouths 
small, round, LrigUt golden-yellow, not changing color where bruised. 
Stem firm, solid, tapering upward, yellow, punctate with reddish dots 
or squamules. Spores olive-green, 12.5x4-5^. 

Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods. Port Jefferson. July. Cold Spring Harbor, H. C. Beardslee. 

This is a pretty Boletus, well marked by the red dots of the stem. 
It is apparently a very rare species. B. radicans is said to have the 
stem sprinkled with red particles, but that is a larger plant with the 
margin of the pileus persistently involute or incurved and with a radi- 
cating stem, characters which are not shown by our fungus. Peck, 5oth 
Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

I found my specimens at Mt. Gretna, Pa., August-September, 1898.

Stem at first extended, neither bulbous nor reticulated with veins, 
wrinkled or striated in some species. Flesh in some changing color 
where wounded. 

The tubes are generally yellow or greenish-yellow. In some species 
they are occasionally somewhat depressed around the stem, but they do 
not form a rounded free stratum, nor, with the exception of B. rubeus, 
are they stuffed when young as in most of the Edules. The species are 
scarcely separable from those of the preceding tribe except by the more 
evidently tomentose young pileus.

Doylestown, Pa., PascJiall. Quite common on flat benches where hem- 
locks and spruces have grown. 

When the caps are cooked they are sweet, nutty, excellent. 

B. Roxa'nse Frost. Pileus broadly convex, at first subtomentose, 
then covered with red hairs in bundles, yellowish-brown. Flesh yel-

brownish-black striations, yellow, velvety and brownish-rufescent at the 
base. Spores lo-i 3x4/4. 

Pine and oak woods. Minnesota, Johnson.

Polyporaceee 

Boletus, wounded. Tubes subadnate; greenish-yellow," changing to blue where 
wounded; their mouths rather large, angular, unequal. Stem subequal, 
rigid, fibrous-striate, red or pale-yellow. Spores fusiform, pale-brown, 
11-12.5x4-5^. 

Pileus 1-3 in. broad. Stem 1-3 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods and mossy banks. 

The species is common and very variable. The color of the pileus 
may be yellowish-brown, reddish-brown, brick-red, tawny or olivaceous. 
The subcutaneous reddish tint and the reddish chinks of the cracked 
pileus are distinguishing features. Wounds of the tubes sometimes 
become blue then greenish. Authors disagree concerning the edible 
qualities of this Boletus. Stevenson gives it as edible, but Cordier and 
Gillet say that it is regarded with suspicion. In one strongly marked 
form the tubes are decidedly depressed around the stem, in another the 
flesh is whitish tinged with red. It may be doubted whether these are 
varieties or distinct species. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

I have found, and eaten plentifully of this species in West Virginia, 
North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, from July until October. 
I have no hesitancy in recommending it in all of its varieties. Excepting 
from very young specimens the tubes and stems should be removed. 
The flesh is sweet, delicate and toothsome. 

B. fumo'sipes Pk. Pileus convex or nearly plane, minutely tomen- 
tose, sometimes minutely rivulose, dark olive-brown. Flesh whitish. 
Tubes at first nearly plane, becoming convex with age, their mouths 
whitish when young, becoming yellowish-brown, changing to bluish- 
black where bruised. Stem equal, solid, smoky-brown, minutely scurfy 
under a lens. Spores purplish-brown, 12.5-15x5-6^. 

Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 3-4 lines thick. 

Woods. Port Jefferson. July. 

This species resembles small dark-colored forms of B. chrysenteron, 
and this resemblance is still more noticeable in those specimens in which 
the pileus cracks in areas, for in these the chinks become red as in that 
species. The different color of the stem and tubes will at once separate 
these species. Peck, 5oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

and yellow, yellow under the cuticle, the thin margin at first inflexed, Boletus, 
then horizontal, curved upward when old. Flesh pale-yellow, chang- 
ing to blue where wounded. Tubes adnate or slightly depressed around 
the stem, lemon-yellow and stiiffed when young, becoming yellow and 
sometimes red at the mouths. Stem small, often flexuous, colored like 
the pileus, reddish within, white-tomentose at the base. Spores 9-12.5 
X4-5/*. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 1-3 in. long, 3-5 lines thick. 

Deep woods. Rare. New England, Frost. 

This is apparently too closely related to B. chrysenteron, and it also 
resembles B. bicolor. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. frater'nus Pk. Pileus convex, becoming plane or depressed, 
slightly tomentose, deep red when young, becoming dull red with age. 
Flesh yellow, slowly changing to greenish-blue where wounded. Tubes 
rather long, becoming ventricose, slightly depressed about the stem, 
their walls sometimes slightly decurrent, the mouths large, angular or 
irregular, sometimes compound, bright yellow, quickly changing to blue 
where wounded. Stem short, cespitose, often irregular, solid, sub- 
tomentose, slightly velvety at the base, pale reddish-yellow, paler above 
and below, yellow within, quickly changing to dark green where 
wounded. Spores 1 2. 5x6/1*. 

Pileus i-i-5 in. broad. Stem I-I-5 in. l n g, 3-6 lines thick. 

Shaded streets. Auburn, Alabama. July. Underwood. 

The species is apparently allied to B. rubeus, but is very distinct by 
its small size, cespitose habit, color of the flesh of the stem and by the 
peculiar hues assumed where wounded. When the pileus cracks the 
chinks become yellow as in B. subtomentosus. The species belongs to 
the tribe Subtomentosi. Peck, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3. 

B. subtomento'sus L. sub; tomentosus, downy. Pileus convex or 
nearly plane, soft, dry, villoso-tomentose , subolivaceous , concolorous be- 
neath the cuticle, often cracked in areas. Flesh white or pallid. Tubes 
adnate or somewhat depressed around the stem, yellow, their mouths 
large, angular. Stem stout, somewhat ribbed-sulcate, scabrous or 
scurfy with minute dots. Spores 1012.5x4-5^. 

Pileus 1-4 in. broad. Stem 1-2.5 m - long, 2-5 lines thick. 

Common and variable. The pileus is usually olivaceous or yellow-

Polyporaceae 

Boletus, ish-brown, but it may be reddish-brown or taTvny-red. When it cracks 
the chinks become yellow. The species, as I understand it, may be 
distinguished from its near relative, B. chrysenteron, by its paler flesh, 
the clearer yellow tubes not changing to blue where wounded, and by 
the chinks of the pileus becoming yellow. The species is recorded 
edible by Cordier, Curtis and Palmer. Gillet says it is only medium in 
quality. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Found and eaten in West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Penn- 
sylvania. Specimens received from Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama. 
I have not seen any change of color in flesh or tubes. It is common 
in Woodland Cemetery and Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. If the 
tubes are not removed the dish is slimy. The B. chrysenteron also 
makes such a dish when stewed, but fried, and well done, both species 
are decidedly good. 

B. CSespito'sus Pk. cespitose. Pileus broadly convex or nearly 
plane, sometimes slightly concave by the elevation of the margin, even, 
brown or blackish-brown, the margin often a little paler or reddish- 
brown. Flesh slightly tinged with red. Tubes adnate or slightly de- 
current, yellow, their mouths rather large, angular, concolorous. Stem 
short, even, solid, glabrous, tapering upward, brown or reddish-brown. 
Spores oblong-elliptic, lOft long, 5/* broad. 
Pileus 1-2.5 cm - broad. Stem 2-2.5 cm. long, 4-6 mm. thick. 

Cespitose. Virginia. August. R. S. Phifer. 

A small species growing in tufts and referable to the tribe Subtomen-

Flesh white, unchangeable, brownish-red above. Tubes adnate, yellow, 
their mouths minute, subrotund. Stem firm, clavate, even, woolly-scaled, 
yellow or brownish, yellowish-white within. Spores 12x4/4. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad.

Polyporaceee 

this name do not in my opinion belong to it, and its occurrence here is Boletus, 
somewhat doubtful. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

In oak woods near Bartram's Garden, West Philadelphia, in 1887- 
1888, I found several Boleti answering the description, exactly, of B. 
spadiceus. They proved to be good eating. 

B. radi'cans Pers. radix, a root. Pileus convex, dry, subtomen- 
tose, olivaceous-cinereus, becoming pale-yellowish, the margin thin, in- 
volute. Flesh pale-yellow, instantly changing to dark blue, taste bit- 
terish. Tubes adnate, their mouths large, unequal, lemon-yellow. Stem 
even, tapering downward and radicating, flocculose with a reddish 
bloom, pale-yellow, becoming naked and dark with a touch. 

Pileus 2-3 in. broad. Stem 2 in. long, 6 lines thick. 

Woods. Ohio, Morgan. 

Of the American plant Mr. Morgan says that the pileus is quite firm 
and dry, becomes reddish or brownish-yellow and nearly glabrous, 
that the flesh is pale-yellow, but that he has not observed any bluish 
tinge, and that the spores are olive, fusiform, 10 12.5x5;*. Those of the 
European plant have been described as very pale ocher, almost white, 
6ju, long, 3/x broad. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

Near Bryn Mawr, Pa. W. C. Alderson, 1894. 

Several specimens brought to me were eaten. The change in color 
of flesh was instantaneous upon exposure to the air. Taste strong and 
raw rather than bitterish. The caps alone were cooked, and dish marked 
"fine." 

B. muta'bilis Morg. changeable. Jour. Cin. Soc. Nat. Sci., Vol. 
VII. Pileus convex, then plane or depressed, compact, dry, sub- 
tomentose, brown. Flesh bright-yellow, promptly changing to blue 
where wounded. Tubes adnate or subdecurrent, their mouths large, 
angular, unequal, some of them compound, yellow changing to green- 
ish yellow and quickly becoming blue where wounded. Stem stout, 
solid, flexuous, subsulcate, yellowish beneath the brown dot-like scales, 
bright yellow within. Spores olive, fusiform, 12-13x5^. 

Pileus 2.5-4 m - broad. Stem 2-3 in. long, 6 lines thick.

A shade of yellow sometimes appears beneath the brown of the pileus, 
and as the plants grow old the pileus becomes blackish, glabrous and

Boleti of the U. S. 

B. badi'ceps Pk. badius, bay and head. (Plate CXVI, p. 420.) 
Pileus firm, convex or somewhat centrally depressed when mature, dry, 
velvety, obliquely truncate on the margin, bay-red or dark-maroon 
color. Flesh white unchangeable, taste and odor mild, sweet, sug- 
gestive of molasses. Tubes plane, adnate, white or whitish, becoming 
dingy with age, the mouths minute. Stem equal or slightly swollen in 
the middle, radicating, glabrous, solid, brownish. 

Pileus 4-8 cm. broad. Stem 4-5 cm. long, 1.5-3 cm - thick. 

Oak woods. West Philadelphia, Pa. August and September. Charles 
Mcllvaine. 

The truncate or beveled margin of the pileus is a striking feature in 
this species. It is about 4 mm. broad and as even as if cut with a 
knife. Sometimes the surface of the stem ruptures transversely just be- 
low the top, the liberated shreds above curling upward against the tubes 
and those below curving outward and downward. In mature plants 
brownish spots appear in the flesh of the pileus. "When cooked it is 
of high flavor and tender as kidney," C. Mcllvaine. Peck, Bull. Tor- 
rey Bot. Club, January 27, 1900. 

LACERI'PEDES lacerated stem. 

Stem elongated, coarsely pitted or deeply and lacunosely reticulated 
in small hollows, the ridges somewhat intumescent in wet weather and 
more or less lacerated, giving a rough or shaggy appearance to the stem. 

The species of this tribe are few, very closely allied and so far as 
known are peculiar to this country.

PileilS 1.5-4 m - broad. Stem 3-7 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

This is distinguished from the other species by the dry squamulose 
pileus and the color of the stem. The latter is sometimes curved at the 
base. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

B. Russelli occurs in the West Virginia mountains, where I found 
and ate it in August, 1883. Though solitary in its method of growth, 
it is frequent in many parts of Pennsylvania, among leaves in mixed 
woods. August to October. 

Taste when raw, sweet, mild. Cooked it is rather soft, tasty. Tubes 
and stem should be removed. 

B. Mor'gani Pk. Pileus convex, soft, glabrous viscid, red or yel- 
low, or red fading to yellow on the margin. Flesh whitish tinged with 
red and yellow, unchangeable. Tubes convex, depressed around the 
stem, rather long and large, bright-yellow becoming greenish-yellow. 
Stem elongated, tapering upward, pitted with long, narrow depressions, 
yellow, red in the depressions, colored within like the flesh of the pileus. 
Spores olive-brown, 18-22/1. long, about half as broad. 

PileilS 1.5-2.5 in. broad. Stem 3-5 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Rocky hillsides in woods of deciduous trees. Kentucky, Morgan. 

In wet weather the anastomosing ridges of the stem swell and become 
broadly winged, thereby giving the stem a peculiar lacerated appear- 
ance. The glabrous viscid pileus and the coloration of the stem distin- 
guish the species. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

B. Morgani is found in like localities with B. Russelli. Excepting in 
its smooth, viscid cap and whitish flesh, it closely resembles the latter. 
The ridges in the stems of both species swell when moist. 

Its edible qualities are the same as B. Russelli. 

B. Be'tula Schw. birch. Pileus convex, viscose and shining in wet 
weather, tessellately cracked and reticulated, orange-fawn color, rather 
small. Flesh yellowish-white. Tubes separating, rather large, yellow, 
almost like those of B. subtomentosus but not greenisli. Stem long,

CALO'PODES. Gr. beautiful; Gr. feet. 

Stem stout, at first bulbous, typically venose-reticulated with veins. 
Tubes adnate, their mouths not reddish. 

The reticulate stem and adnate tubes of one color distinguish the 
species of this tribe. In the Luridi the mouths of the tubes are differ- 
ently colored, and in the closely related Edules the tubes are more or 
less depressed around the stem or sub-free, and their pores are com- 
monly stuffed when young. Fries did not admit species with whitish 
tubes into this tribe, but we have done so in those cases in which this 
was the only character to exclude them.

of the U. S. 

West Virginia, 1882-1885. Mt. Gretna, Pa. ; New Jersey, Mcllvaine. 

The caps, alone, of this species, are desirable, the stems not cooking 
well. Its way of bunching itself gratifies the collector, as do its flavor 
and quality. 

B. pacliypus Fr. Gr. thick-footed. Pileus convex, subtomentose,. 
brownish or pale tan-color. Flesh thick, whitish, changing slightly to

firm, reticulated, at first ovate-bulbous, then elongated, equal, varie- 
gated with red and pale-yellow. Spores large, ovate, pale yellowish- 
ochraceous, 12.5-14x5-6^. 

Pileus 4-8 in. broad. Stem 2-4 in. long. 

Woods, either of pine or beech. 

This species is noted for its thick, stout stem, which sometimes at- 
tains a diameter of more than two inches. It approaches the Edules in 
habit, but according to Gillet it is poisonous, or at least to be suspect- 
ed, has a penetrating unpleasant odor and a somewhat nauseous flavor. 
He also describes the pores as at first whitish. The stem is sometimes 
intensely blood-red. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

A common species in West Virginia mountains, 18811885, in beech 
groves. August to frost. It is rare in the pines of New Jersey, though 
I have found it there. Like B. felleus, its size and attractiveness induce 
the finder to over and over again try cooking it, hoping the discovery of 
a successful way to rid it of its unpleasantness. I have never suc- 
ceeded It is not poisonous.

Tubes subfree, rounded-depressed around the stem, their mouths not 
at first reddish, but commonly white-stuffed. Stem stout, bulbous as 
in the Luridi but not, with a few exceptions, reticulate nor dotted with 
pointed scales nor red. Flesh scarcely changeable. Taste pleasant. 

This tribe is not sharply limited but partakes to some extent of the 
characters of Calopodes and Luridi. From the former its nearly free 
and at first white-stuffed tubes and its generally even stem separate it, 
from the latter its tubes with concolorous mouths or at least with mouths 
not red or reddish when young will distinguish it. The species are gen- 
erally of large or medium size and noted for their esculent qualities.

One of the handsomest of Boleti. It varies greatly in size and 
color, but traces of purple or lilac are always detectable. The reticu- 
lations upon the stem are often obscure, especially in young specimens.

Polyporaceae 

Boletus. Indiana, H. I. Miller, Dr. J. R. Weist; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia, Mcllvaine. 

Some species of fungi appear to have that prize of Fairyland the 
Wishing Cap and by its power be able to take on any form they please. 
Boletus edulis is one of them. Its variableness is puzzling. It is eaten 
everywhere where found and is a favorite. Carefully sliced, dried and 
kept where safe from mold it may be prepared for the table at any 
season. 

TJ. edulis Bull. Var. davipes Pk. (Plate CXIX, fig. i, p. 445.) 
Pileus fleshy, convex, glabrous, grayish-red, bay-red or chestnut-color. 
Flesh white, unchangeable. Tubes at first concave or nearly plane, 
white and stuffed, then convex, slightly depressed around the stem, 
ochraceous yellow. Stem mostly obclavate (inversely club-shaped) 
and reticulate to the base. Spores oblong-fusiform, 12-15x4-5^. 

The club-stemmed Boletus is so closely related to the edible Boletus 
and so closely connected by the intermediate forms that it seems to be 
only a variety of it, but one worthy of illustration. It differs in the 
more uniform color of the cap, in having the tubes less depressed 
around the stem and less tinted with green when mature, and in having 
the stem more club-shape and commonly reticulated to the base. The 
lower reticulations are usually coarser but less permanent than the up- 
per. The cap is more highly colored when young and is apt to become 
paler with age, but the margin does not become paler than the central 
part, as it so often does in the edible Boletus. Individuals sometimes 
occur in which the stem is nearly cylindric and reticulated only on the 
upper part. These connect so closely with the edible Boletus that we 
have considered this to be a mere variety of it. In size and in edible 
qualities it is very similar to that species. Peck, 5 Ist Rep. N. Y. State 
Bot. 

Same in quality as B. edulis. 

B. vari'ipes Pk. variable stem. Pileus convex or nearly plane, 
thick, soft, dry, scaly, pointed scaly or minutely tomentose, grayish or 
pale grayish-brown, sometimes tinged with yellow or ochraceous. Flesh 
white, unchangeable. Tubes convex or nearly plane, slightly depressed 
around the stem, at first white, then greenish-yellow, their mouths 
small, subrotund, ochraceous, stuffed when young. Stem firm, reticu-

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898. Stem slightly reticulated at top, 
indistinctly striate below. 'Smell and taste strong, like B. felleus, but 
sweetish, not bitter. When tubes are removed and cap fried it is 
excellent. 

Var. al'bipes. Stem whitish, wholly reticulated, the reticulations 
coarser near the base. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898. Taste slightly acrid, smell slight. 
Excellent. 

Var. pallid 'ipes. Stem pallid, slightly furfuraceous, even or obscurely 
reticulated toward the base, distinctly reticulated above. Peck, Boleti

Satiny, shining. Taste slightly acrid, smell slight. Excellent. 

Var. tenu'ipes. Stem slender, elongated. Peck, Boleti of the U.S. 

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898, on decaying chestnut stump and on 
ground. Excellent. Mcllvaine. 

This species, with its varieties, grows in mixed woods, the density of 
which has much to do with its general appearance. Individuals grow- 
ing where the sun plays upon them, show the reticulations plainer than 
those maturing in the shade. The tubes should be removed before 
cooking. The caps are best fried. 

B. exi'mius Pk. select. PileuS at first very compact, subglobose 
or hemispherical, subpruinose, purplish-brown or chocolate color, some- 
times with a faint tinge of lilac, becoming convex, soft, smoky-red or 
pale-chestnut. Flesh grayish or reddish-white. Tubes at first con- 
cave or nearly plane, stuffed, colored nearly like the pileus, becoming 
paler with age and depressed around the stem, their mouths minute, 
rotund. Stem stout, generally short, equal or tapering upward, ab- 
ruptly narrowed at the base, minutely branny, colored like or a little 
paler than the pileus, purplish-gray within. Spores subferruginous,

This plant is remarkable for the whitish or leprous spots which the

color of the flesh and tubes. The stem is very thick at the top but 
tapers downward. Peck, Boleti of the U. S.

Spores rusty-ochraceous, 9-12x4-5^. 
The Related boletus belongs to the 
tribe of Boleti known as Edules be- 

cause of their especially esculent character, but it differs from the gen- 
eral character of the tribe in having its tubes not at all or but slightly 
shortened around the stem and in its stem not being thickened or bulb- 
ous at the base. The species is quite variable in the color of the cap, 
which is generally darker in young plants, paler in old ones. It may 
be brown, reddish-brown or btackish-brown when young, but is more or 
less tinged with tawny or ochraceous when old. It is smooth and even 
or minutely tomentose and sometimes slightly rugose. In wet weather

BOLETUS AFFINIS. 



the margin of the cap sometimes curves upward, giving a very convex Boletus, 
surface to the tubes. Sometimes the wounded flesh slowly assumes a 
yellowish hue. The peculiar rusty-ochraceous hue of the spores is also 
seen sometimes in the tubes of old specimens. As in many species, the 
flesh of old plants is more soft than that of young ones. The stem is 
quite variable and is often narrowed downward. It is sometimes very 
obscurely reticulated at the top. 

The cap is generally 2-4 in. broad, the stem 1.5-3 m - l n g 4-8 lines 
thick. The plants are found in thin woods or in bushy places in July 
and August. 

Var. maculo ' sus Pk. differs from the type simply in having a few 
yellowish spots scattered over the cap. 

While not as high flavored as some Boleti this is, nevertheless, a 
fairly good and perfectly safe one. Peck, 49th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Very open timber in Woodlands Cemetery, Philadelphia. August,

The deeply cracked surface of the pileus is the most notable feature 
of this species. This sometimes is seen even in quite young plants. 
The cracked areas are quite unequal in size. The deep chinks with 
sloping sides cause them to appear like frusta of polygonal pyramids. 
In some specimens the reticulations of the stem extend nearly or quite 
to its base, and make the place of the species ambiguous between the 
Calopodes and Edules. Peck, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

The deep cracks in the cap readily distinguish this species. After 
rains the caps are frequently slightly dished and widely cracked at 
margin. The exposed flesh dries with a fine silky gloss. The caps 
are excellent. The tubes and stem should be removed.

All authors, up to this date, agree in stating that the species within 
this series are poisonous. Experiments made by Smiedeberg and 
Koppe with Boletus Satanus developed symptoms closely resembling 
poisoning by Amanitae. Kobert, who made analysis of B. luridus, 
shows that it contains muscarine, which is one of the most deadly poisons. 
Such a mass of evidence commands respect. It is urged upon finders 
of these species to either leave them alone or test them in minute 
quantities until they have established their ability to eat them without 
injury. 

I have taken special pains to establish the edibility of B. Satanus and 
B. luridus. For fifteen years I have eaten them in quantity when 
opportunity afforded, in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
My family, and my friends in widely separated localities, have partaken 
freely of them many times and without discomfort. They are remark- 
ably fine eating. The same can be said of B. alveolatus, B. purpureus, 
B. subvelutipes. I have not seen the other species of this tribe. 

I have determined so many of the reputed poisonous species to be 
edible, that unless positively authenticated, I do not accept repute as 
truth, but carefully test suspicious species upon myself. When sure 
there is no danger, I as carefully have them tested by my numerous 
under-tasters male and female. 

B. Sa'tanus Lenz. Satanic. Pileus convex, glabrous, somewhat 
gluey, brownish-yellow or whitish. Flesh whitish, becoming reddish or 
violaceous where wounded. Tubes free, yellow, their mouths bright 
red becoming orange-colored with age. Stem thick, ovate- ventricose, 
marked above with red reticulations. Spores I2x5/*.

Though mild to the taste, this Boletus is said to be very poisonous, 
a character suggestive of the specific name. Fries describes the color 
of the spores as earthy-yellow; Smith as rich brown. Peck, Boleti of

Polyporaceee 

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mcllvaine. Boletus. 

Boletus Satanus is sometimes plentiful in spots. Where it luxuriates 
it is a rich decoration to the ground, and earth upon upturned-roots 
upon which it often grows. It does not live long after reaching ma- 
turity, but decomposes into a putrescent mass. 

Its reputation rivals that of the original possessor of its name. But 
old proverb sayeth that even "The Devil is not as black as he is 
painted." See remarks heading Luridi. 

B. alveola'tllS B. and C. Pileus convex, glabrous, shining, bright 
crimson or maroon-color, sometimes paler and varied with patches of 
yellow. Flesh firm, white, changing to blue where wounded. Tubes 
adnate, subdecurrent, yellow with maroon-colored mouths, the hymenial 
surface uneven with irregular alveolar depressions. Stem very rough 
with the margins of rather coarse subreticular depressions, the reticula- 
tions bright-red above with yellow stains. Spores yellowish-brown, 
1 2. 5^1 5x4-5/1. 

Pileus 3-6 in. broad. Stem 3-4 in. long, 9 lines thick.

West Virginia mountains, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, in mixed woods 
and on banks of streams. Mcllvaine. 

B. alveolatus appears to be more generally distributed than B. Satanus. 
It is not as clannish, though occasionally three or four are found grow- 
ing together. When growing from the banks of creeks, or between the 
roots of beech and other trees in low places, it is often deformed in cap 
and stem. The texture is firm, close and the taste is very pleasant. It 
botanically takes its place in this suspected series. I consider it one of 
the best Boleti. See remarks heading Luridi. 

B. lu'ridus Schaeff. lurid in color. Pileus convex, tomentose, 
brown-olivaceous, then somewhat viscose, sooty. Flesh yellow, chang- 
ing to blue where wounded. Tubes free, yellow, becoming greenish, 
their mouths round, vermilion, becoming orange. Stem stout, vermilion, 
somewhat orange at the top, reticulate or punctate. Spores greenish- 
gray, 15x9. 

Pileus 2-4 in. broad. Stem 2-3 in. long.

Polyporaceae 

Boletus, lated stem, is regarded as a variety of this species. The red-stemmed 
Boletus, B. erythropus Pers., is also indicated as a variety of it by 
Fries. It is smaller than B. luridus, has a brown or reddish-brown 
pileus and a slender cylindrical stem, not reticulated, but dotted with 
squamules. It has been reported from California by Harkness and 
Moore. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Var. erytliropus received from Dr. J. W. Harshberger, Philadelphia, 
May, 1896. 

Often shining as if varnished and very handsome. I frequently found 
it in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in mixed woods 
among leaves. Its reputation is bad. It is undoubtedly edible by 
many, and is delicious. The caution heading Luridi should be carefully 
observed. 

B. purpu'reilS Fr. purple. Pileus convex, opaque, dry, somewhat 
velvety, purplish-red. Flesh in the young plant only becoming blue, 
then dark-yellow. Tubes nearly free, yellow or greenish-yellow, their 
mouths minute, purple-orange, changing to blue where wounded. Stem 
stout, firm, adorned with purple veins or dots, sometimes reticulated at 
the apex only, yellow, reddish within, especially at the base. Spores 
greenish-brown, 1012x56/1..

West Virginia, Mt. Gretna, Pa., Mcllvaine. 

At Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897-1898, B. purpureus was common in oak 
and chestnut woods. It is a showy species, easily distinguished by its 
velvety cap. In young specimens the stem is robust, then tapering 
upward. When old the cap loses its rich color toward the margin, 
becoming yellowish. The flesh is thick, firm and of excellent flavor. 
It undoubtedly proved itself delicious and harmless to many eating it. 

B. vermiculo'sus Pk. wormy. Pileus broadly convex, thick, firm, 
dry, glabrous, or very minutely tomentose, brown, yellowish-brown or 
grayish-brown, sometimes tinged with red. Flesh white or whitish, 
quickly changing to blue where wounded. Tubes plane or slightly 
convex, nearly free, yellow, their mouths small, round, brownish-orange, 
becoming darker or blackish with age, changing promptly to blue

The species is separated from B. luridus by its dry pileus, white 
flesh, even stem, which is neither reticulated nor dotted, and by its 
smaller spores. I can not distinguish specimens of B. Spraguei received 
from Mr. Frost, from this species. The name is scarcely appropriate, 
for specimens are not always infested by larvae. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

I have not seen this species, therefore, have not tested it. CAUTION . 

B. subvelu'tipes Pk. velvety-stem. Pileus convex, firm, subgla- 
brous, yellowish-brown or reddish-brown. Flesh whitish, both it and 
the tubes changing to blue where wounded. Tubes plane or slightly 
convex, nearly free, yellowish, their mouths small, brownish-red. Stem 
equal or slightly tapering upward, firm, even, somewhat pruinose above, 
velvety with a hairy tomentum toward the base, yellow at the top, red- 
dish-brown below, varied with red and yellow within. Spores I5~i8x

This species resembles the preceding one in general appearance, but 
it is very distinct by its much longer spores and by the velvety hairiness 
toward the base of the stem. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

Boletus subvelutipes is common in some localities in Pennsylvania, 
especially on the Springton Hills, in chestnut and oak woods. I have 
frequently eaten it and found it excellent. Others should carefully 
test it. 

B. fir'mus Frost firm. Pileus convex, very firm, slightly tomen- 
tose, gray, often pitted. Flesh yellowish or deep-yellow, changing to 
blue where wounded. Tubes adnate, deeply arcuate, unequal, yellow,

this a synonym of Boletus floccopus. The species does not appear to

Woods, swamps and open places. 
(Plate CXXI.) . 

Very common and appearing through 

summer and autumn. 

This may fairly be called our most 
common and variable species. It is 
recorded in nearly every local list of 
fungi. The pileus is convex, hemis- 
pherical or even subconical. It may be 
glabrous, minutely tomentose, subvel- 
vety or squamulose. The flesh is white 
or whitish and sometimes slightly change- 
able where wounded. The tubes are gen- 
erally rather long and with a rounded or 
convex surface. The stem is distinctly 
scabrous or roughened with small black- 
ish-brown or reddish dots or scales, the 
ground color generally being whitish, 
grayish or pallid. The spores have 
been described as pale-brown and light- 
yellowish. When caught in a mass on white paper they appear 
to me to approach snuff-brown. The viscidity of the pileus is not 
always clearly discernible. Indeed the pileus is often quite as dry as in 
B. versipellis. When moistened by heavy rains it sometimes is smooth 
and clammy to the touch but scarcely viscid. Several varieties have 
been indicated which are expressive of the variations in the color of the 
pileus. 

Var. testa ceus. Pileus brick-red. 
Var. auranti'acus. Pileus orange or orange-red. 
These appear to connect this species and B. versipellis. 
Var. aluta'ceus. Pileus yellowish-tan color. 
Var. fuligin'eus. Pileus fuliginous or cinereous-fuliginous. 
Var. ftis'cus. Pileus brown or dark-brown. 
Var. oliva'ceus. Pileus olivaceous. 

Var. ni'veus. Pileus white, when old sometimes stained with blue or 
livid-blue. 

To these might be added :

wounded. 

Var. graci'lipes. Stem very slender, 2-3 in. long, 2-3 lines thick. 
Pileus thin, translucent when held toward the light. 

This Boletus is classed among the edible species, but it is said to be 
less agreeable than B. edulis. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mcllvaine. 

The numerous varieties with their peculiarities here given by Professor 
Peck will enable the finder of a Boletus with a distinctly scabrous stern 
roughened with scales, not reticulate to select its name. For the 
mycophagist it is enough to know that he has Boletus scaber. In all of 
its varieties it is edible. The stems, often the tubes, unless young, 
should be discarded, as they do not cook in the same time as the caps. 
The comparative excellence of the species rests with the devourer. It 
deserves a high place. 

B. scaber, var. areolatus, Plate CXVIII, fig. 4, has slight flavor, 
but is of pleasing consistency. 

B. -durius'culus Schulz somewhat hard. Pileus 2-5 in. across, 
hemispherical, minutely velvety, viscid when moist, varying in color 
from pale-brown, through dingy-chestnut, to umber-brown, often be- 
coming cracked in areas when dry, interstices paler. Flesh thick, white 
or tinged yellow, when cut becoming reddish copper-color. Tubes % 
% in. long, shortened round the stem and free, openings about %mm. 
across, often compound, irregularly angular, bright-yellow. Stem 4-7 
in. long, fusiform, thickest part 1)22 in. across, situated below the 
middle, yellowish, rough with blackish points, which are sometimes ar- 
ranged in a subreticulate manner, apex sometimes more or less grooved, 
solid, flesh of upper part becoming coppery like the pileus. Spores 
elongate-cylindrical, pale-umber, i4-:6x5-6/x. 

In woods. Esculent and very delicious. Allied to Boletus scaber, 
but distinguished by the bright-yellow tubes and the very firm flesh, 
which turns coppery-red when exposed to the air ; this color eventually 
changes to a dingy grayish-violet. Also allied to Boletus porphyro- 
sporus. Massee.

Pileus 1-2 in. broad. Stem 1-2 in. long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods. New York, Peck. 

This is closely related to B. scaber, of which it may possibly prove 
to be a dwarf form ; but it is easily distinguished by its smooth or only 
slightly scurfy and subbulbous stem. It presents no appearance of the 
colored dot-like squamules which are a constant and characteristic 
feature of that species. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

West Virginia. Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. Mcllvaine. 

Specimens found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., had a satiny, glossy stem, 
beautifully furfuraceous, and stem not thickened at base. Professor 
Peck, to whom specimens were sent, writes: "Stem is a little more 
furfuraceous, and not thickened at the base, otherwise the agreement is 
very good." It is good fried. 

B. chro'mapes Frost. Pileus convex or nearly plane, slightly and 
sometimes fasciculately tomentose, pale-red. Flesh white, unchangeable. 
Tubes subadnate, more or less depressed around the stem, white or 
whitish, becoming brown. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, 
rough-spotted, whitish or pallid, chrome-yellow at the base both without 
and within, sometimes reddish above. Spores oblong, 12-14x4-5. 

PileilS 2-4 in. broad. Stem 2-4 in. long, 4-6 lines thick. 

Woods. New England, Frost; New York, Peck. 

The yellow base of the stem appears to be a peculiar and constant 
character by which the species may easily be recognized. It imitates 
Boletus piperatus in this respect, but in everything els.e it is very dis- 
tinct from that plant. Sometimes the stem' is so badly infested by 
larvae that it is difficult to procure a sound specimen. The spores have 
a subferruginous color with a slight incarnate tint, but the rough-dotted 
stem indicates a relationship with B. scaber. Through this species, Bo-

present custom to write it "chromopus." Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

A dozen or more specimens referable to this species were found by 
me at Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1897, in mixed woods. The caps were 
eaten and were excellent. 

B. neblllo'sus Pk. PileilS convex, dry, snuff-brown or smoky-brown. 
Flesh white, unchangeable. Tubes convex, depressed around the stem,

By a painting made by the writer September, 1885, Professor Peck 
identified the species of which it is a picture as B. nebulosus Pk. The 
following notes accompany it, which have been verified many times 
since their writing : 

Oak woods. West Philadelphia, Pa., September. Mt. Gretna, Pa., 
September. 

Pileus chestnut-brown and darker, covered with small, low, black 
spots; convex, often depressed in center, sharp on margin. Flesh 
white, thick, solid, unchangeable. Tubes very small, and light pink- 
ish-brown. When touched they change to a deeper hue. Stem same 
color as pileus, but a shade lighter, solid, scurfy, having a striate ap- 
pearance, enlarging toward base. 

Taste sweet and pleasant. Cooked it is juicy, meaty and very fine. 

B. ful'vus Pk. brownish-yellow. (Plate CXVI, fig. 3, p. 420.) 
Pileus thick, convex or subcampanulate, dry, glabrous, rimose-areolate,

HYPORHO'DII. Gr. somewhat rose-colored. 

Tubes adnate to the stem, whitish, then white-incarnate from the 
rosy spores. 

In this tribe the tubes are at first whitish, but with the development 
of the spores they usually assume a pinkish or flesh-colored hue. 
Wounds of the tubes in some species cause a change in color but not to 
blue, nor are the tube mouths differently colored as in the Luridi. The 
stem in some is more or less reticulated but this is scarcely a constant 
or reliable character in these species. Typically the spores are rosy or 
flesh-colored, but I have admitted species in which they incline to rust- 
colored, giving more weight to the color of the tubes than to that of 
the spores.

The species is compared to Boletus scaber, from which it differs in its 
smaller tubes and smooth stem, and from both this and B. albellus it 
differs in the color of the tubes and in the yellowish flocci of the pileus. 
I have seen no specimens, but on account of the color of the tubes I 
have placed the species with the Hyporhodii. Peck, Boleti of the U.S.

The slender habit separates this species from all the others here in- 
cluded in this tribe. Its spores are not a clear incarnate in color, but 
incline to dull-ferruginous, and by this character this and the preceding 
species connect this tribe with Versipelles. In color B. gracilis resem- 
bles some forms of B. felleus, but in size, habit and color of spores it 
is easily distinct. The tomentum of the pileus sometimes breaks into 
tufts or squamules. This is Boletus vinaceus, Frost MS. Peck, Boleti 
of the U. S. 

B. gracilis, var. laevipes, was found by the writer in Woodland Ceme- 
tery, West Philadelphia, August, 1897, an d at Mt. Gretna, Pa., Sep- 
tember, 1898. The stem of some specimens spreads at the top. The 
pileus is often cracked on the margin, and the upturning of the margin 
often exposes the tubes. Painting, as of this species, identified by 
Professor Peck. 

The taste is at first sweet, then bitter. The bitterness is lost in cook- 
ing. Edible, good.

The mild taste and darker colored spores will separate this Boletus 
from any form of B. felleus. Its stem reticulated above distinguishes it 
from B. alutarius. It resembles B. modestus in some respects, but its 
tubes are not at all yellow. Peck, Boleti of the U. S.

Boletus indecisus so closely resembles B. felleus in some of its forms 
that until the color of the spores is ascertained, the sweet taste, without 
trace of bitter, is the only thing that will enable the finder to discrimi- 
nate between them. Young B. felleus are at first pleasant to the taste 
and do not, at once, develop their intense bitter in the mouth. They 
m*ay readily be taken for B. indecisus. If, by mistake, a single B. fel- 
leus is cooked with mild species, the dish will be spoiled. Specimens be- 
lieved to be B. indecisus should be tested. A minute will perfectly sat- 
isfy anyone.

Common in West Virginia mountains where it grows with B. felleus, 
from which it is impossible to distinguish it without tasting. It is de- 
licious when cooked. But I long ago ceased collecting for the table 
any Boletus questionable for B. felleus. I have been deceived so many 
times taken the bitter for the sweet that, preferring the sweet, I take 
no chances for the bitter. 

B. felleus Bull./*/, gall. Bitter. (Plate CXXII, fig. 2, 3, 4,

even, variable in color, pale-yellowish, grayish-brown, yellowish-brown, 
reddish-brown or chestnut. Flesh white, often changing to flesh color 
where wounded, taste bitter. Tubes adnate, long, convex, depressed 
around the stem, their mouths angular, white, becoming tinged with 
flesh-color. Stem variable, equal or tapering upward, short or long, 
sometimes bulbous or enlarged at the base, subglabrous, generally 
reticulated above, colored like or a little paler than the pileus. Spores 
oblong-fusiform, flesh-colored, 12.517.5x45/4. 

Var. obe'sus. Pileus large. Stem thick, coarsely and distinctly 
reticulated nearly or quite to the base. 

Pileus 3-8 in. broad. Stem 2-4 in. long, 6-12 lines thick. 

The variety is large and solitary in its mode of growth. It is remark- 
able for the coarse reticulations of the stem which extend nearly or quite 
to the base. After heavy rains the pileus is viscid. It may prove to 
be a distinct species. 

The flesh in the American plant does not always assume incarnate 
hues where wounded. The color of the fresh tubes often changes to a 
deeper tint where wounded. Peck, Boleti of the U. S. 

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Mcllvaine; 
Indiana, H. I. Miller. 

A very common species in woods and on thin margins, on open 
grassy places, and about decayed stumps. I saw hundreds of plants, 
var. obesus, some a foot in diameter, in a wheat stubble near oak 
woods. 

One of the most attractive of Boleti. Its cap resembles a handsomely 
browned cake. Its solidity is inviting; its flesh, generous in quantity, 
excites appetite. Until one experiences its intense lasting bitter, one

Another distinguishing mark from B. alboater is the velvety pileus of 
the latter. B. nigrellus is mild in taste and smell and an excellent 
species for the table.

Peck, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No. 27. 

In commenting upon this new species to the writer, Professor Peck 
says: "I suspect that the spores of this (B. eccentricus) are pinkish 
or rosy. If so, it belongs here (in Hyporhodii). If not, it may have 
to go in the Luridi, or possibly may be made the type of a new tribe. 

CARIO'SI caries, rottenness. 

Stem never reticulated, stuffed with a spongy pith, at length com- 
monly excavated. Tubes at first white, then often yellowish, their 
mouths minute, round. 

Fries adds to these characters, "spores white." But in our species 
the spores are pale-yellow when shed in a mass on white paper. They 
are more elliptical in outline than the spores of most Boleti. The 
character of the stem is peculiar and easily distinguishes the tribe. The 
exterior is firm, the interior soft and spongy, becoming irregularly 
hollow or cavernous in the typical species.

Boletus castaneus is one of the neatest looking of fungi. The pre- 
vailing color is cinnamon, that of the tubes white or very light yellow, ' 
spotted with brown wherever insects have touched them. The pore 
surface of mature specimens is usually irregular. Whoever has seen 
the stalagmites of Luray Cave will recognize their color on the stems of 
B. castaneus. These are brittle, snapping like pipe stems, with a small 
tube in center. 

The fungus is common from June until September. It is gregarious, 
occasionally three or four individuals form a group. Either raw or 
cooked the caps are edible and will become favorites.

On account of the color of the spores this species has been placed 
with the Cariosi. The description does not mention the character of 
the interior of the stem, and the decurrent tubes depart from the char- 
acter of the typical species so that its true position is uncertain. The 
species seems well marked by the character of the pileus. Peck, Boleti

APPENDIX (Boletus). 

The descriptions of the following species are scarcely sufficient to 
permit of the satisfactory reference of the species to their places in the 
tribes. It is to be hoped that these plants may again be found and 
their proper relations be ascertained. 

B. Ana'nas Curt. Pileus pulvinate, thickly and rigidly floccose-ver- 
rucose, yellow, flocci white above, flesh-colored beneath, the margin 
thin, membranous, lacerated; hymenium plane, depressed around the 
stem, yellow or tawny-yellow, becoming greenish where wounded, their 
mouths medium size, obtusely angular. Stem even, solid, somewhat 
enlarged at the base, white. Spores ferruginous. 

Pileus 3-4 in. broad. Stem 3-4 in. long, 6-9 lines thick. 

Under prostrate trunks of pine trees. 

South Carolina, Ravenel; North Carolina, Curtis. 

This is said to approach S. strobilaceus in habitat, but to be other- 
wise very different. It is placed among the Subtomentosi in Sylloge, 
but from these it recedes by its floccose wart-like scales. Peck, Boleti 
of the U. S. 

B. radico'sus Bundy. Pileus thin, wide, recurved, yellow tinged 
with brown, the cuticle easily removed. Flesh pale-yellowish tinged 
with pink, not changing color when bruised. Tubes decurrent, large, 
uneven-mouthed, compound, angular, tinged with brown. Stem flexu- 
ous, yellow above, whitish below, rough with dark appressed scales, 
fibrous-rooted.

because it expresses what appears 
to me to be the most important 
generic character, that is, tubes not 
easily separable from the hymeno-

the tough substance the transition 
between Boletus and Polyporus is 
made.

reddish and then to blackish where wounded. Tubes adnate, whitish, 
becoming brown or blackish with age; their mouths large, angular,

Strobilomyces. rough fuzzy cap reminds of short fur that has been wet and dried. Its 
appearance is unique among Boleti. Before cooking the stem and tubes 
should be removed, unless the latter are very firm and fresh. The 
squamules must be cut away or the dish will be rough. 

With many this Boletus is a prime favorite. It has a strong woody 
taste, sometimes musky, sometimes faintly of anisette. It cooks well 
by any method. 

S. floc'copus Vahl. floccose-stemmed. Pileus convex, soft, cov- 
ered with areas of bunched rough, scaly tomentum, cinereous, at 
length blackish, appendiculate with the silky, thick annular veil. Tubes 
shortened behind, their mouths large, whitish-gray. Stem stout, pitted 
above, umber-tomentose below. Spores perfectly globose, brown, 9/1 
broad. 

PileilS 4-5 in. broad. Stem 4-5 in. long, I in. thick. 

Woods. North Carolina and Pennsylvania, Schweinitz; Ohio, Mor- 
gan; New York, Peck. 

According to Fries this is a larger and firmer species than S. stro- 
bilaceus but manifestly related to it. The New York specimens which 
I have referred to it differ from S. strobilaceus in no respect, except in 
the tubes being depressed around the stem. Unless there are other 
differences in the European plant, it scarcely seems to me to be worthy 
of specific distinction. Boletus floccopus, Rost. tab. 40, is referred to 
Boletus scaber, as is B. holopus, Rost. tab. 48. Peck, Boleti of the 
U. S. 

I agree with Professor Peck that this species is not worthy of specific 
distinction. During 1898 I found a bunch containing eight individuals 
which varied through all botanic characteristics given to both species. 
The largest individual was 4)^ in. across cap, the smallest i/ in. On 
some the tubes were adnate, on others shortened behind. There was 
no difference in flavor excepting that due to age.

A small genus of which F. hepatica is the principal species. This is 
known and valued in Europe and wherever found in this country. Un- 
fortunately it is rare or unknown in many localities. A new species has 
recently been found in the United States Fistulina firma, by Mrs. A. 
M. Hadley, Manchester, N. H. a white-flesh species whose edibility 
is not reported. Torrey Bull., 1899. F- pallida B. and Rav. ; F.

Small specimens may be confounded with F. pallida, which follows. 

Fistulina hepatica is celebrated in most countries, and known usually 
as the Beefsteak fungus. It grows from decaying crevices in oak, chest- 
nut and other trees and stumps, but those named are its favorites. July, 
August, September are its months, and after rains. In some localities' 
and years it is rare. At Mt. Gretna, in 1898, a hundred pounds of it 
could be gathered almost any day.

Fistulina. August, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, Pa., I found several specimens in vi- 
cinity which, though evidently F. hepatica, were remarkable for their 
structure 2-4 in. across, irregularly cylindrical, with spore surface 
covering the entire fungus. Stem curt, eccentric, almost central. 
Specimens were sent Professor Peck, who writes: 

"The sample of Fistulina which you send is a singular thing. Sac- 
cardo has noted a somewhat similar form but without pore surface. 
Yours has pore surface, but I do not find spores developed in it. I am 
inclined to think it a monstrosity, as you do, but as you say you have 
found several of them I think it would be well to put it on record and I 
will enter it in my record as Fistulina hepatica monstrosa n. var. and 
indicate its characters." Letter from Professor Peck, August 28, 1899. 
I have partially succeeded in transplanting the mycelium of F. 
hepatica. Experiments in this direction, I feel confident, will introduce 
this valuable fungus to localities where it is not now found, or is rare. 
Experiments with the spores have not been as yet successful.

On fallen trunks and on stumps. May to November. Mcllvaine. 

This species does not seem to be common in America, but is found 
throughout Europe. It varies in size from 3 in. to over 3 feet. It 
has been known to attain the circumference of 7 ft. 5 in., and the weight 
of 40 Ibs. Dr. Badham says that it can not be masticated and that its 
expressed juice is very disagreeable. The fact, however, remains that 
it is eaten, and is recorded as edible by most authors. It is undoubt- 
edly tough, but cut fine and stewed slowly for half an hour it is quite as 
tender as the muscle of an oyster and has a pleasant flavor. 

P. pi'cipes Fr. pix, pitch ; pes, a foot. Pallid then chestnut, com- 
monly pale yellowish-livid, with the disk chestnut. PileilS fleshy- 
coriaceous, then rigid, tough, even, smooth, depressed at the disk or 
behind. Flesh white. Stem excentric and lateral, equal, firm, at first 
velvety, then naked, dotted, black up to the pores. Pores decurrent, 
round, very small, rather slender, white, then slightly pale yellowish. 
Fries. 

Imbricated, odor somewhat sweet. The pileus is depressed behind, 
commonly emarginate, funnel-shaped with lobes all round. 

On trunks, especially willow. Frequent. July to December. Steven- 
son. 

Many young plants, in tufts upon a decaying oak log, were found by 
me at Mt. Gretna, August, 1899. They were oyster-color, the very 
thin caps translucent, 2-6 in. across, -fa in. thick; pores not visible to 
the naked eye. The black dots upon the stems developed some time 
after gathering.

Polyporaceae 

Poiyporus. They were pleasantly crisp when stewed and of fine flavor. Older 
specimens were bitter and tough. 



III. MERISMA. 

P. umbella'tus Fr. umbella, a sun-shade. Very much branched, 
fibrous-fleshy, toughish. Pileoli very numerous, % \% in. broad, 
sooty, dull-red or pallid light-yellow, entire, umbilicate. Stems elon- 
gated, separate, united at the base, white. Pores minute, white. 

The pileoli have occurred white. Fries.

verneur, N. Y., Mrs. E. C. Ant/tony; West Virginia, New Jersey, Penn- 
sylvania. On decaying roots in ground and on stumps. May to 
November. Mcllvaine. 

Tufts dense, branches spreading from a center. The pilei up to 2 in. 
across, connected at base. The dense spreading tufts, up to a foot 
across and half as high, are very noticeable. The flesh is soft and of 
good flavor. Cook like P. intybaceus. 

P. a'nax Berk. Fleshy, fibrous, rather tough, dusky-gray, branch- 
ing out from a thick, single stem at the base and forming a large head 
of branches and pileoli 10-20 lines in diameter; the branches terminate 
in numerous large pileoli of various forms and size, imbricating, con- 
fluent and recurved. Flesh and pores white. Stems thick, growing 
together, white. Pores large, unequal, angular, white. Spores white, 
subelliptic, 7-8/u, long. 

Ohio, at the base of oak trees and stumps. Autumn. Morgan. 

This species has apparently been confused by some American my- 
cologists with P. intybaceus. I have received specimens of it bearing 
that name. The spores of that species are described as elliptic or ovoid. 
The spores of Poiyporus anax, as shown by our specimens, are globose.

POLYPORUS IXTYBACEUS. 



Polyporacese 

Poiyporus. apply with exceptional force to the cooking of P. intybaceus. If it is 
cut in thin slices across the grain and slowly stewed for half an hour it 
will be tender and of good flavor. It can then be served in that way, 
or made into patties or croquettes. 

P. crista'tus Fr. crista, a crest. Branched, firmly fleshy, fragile. 
Pileoli about 3 in. broad, reddish-green, entire and dimidiate, imbri- 
cated, depressed, somewhat pulverulent-villous, then cracked into scales. 
Stems connate, irregularly shaped, white. Pores minute, angular and 
torn, whitish. Fries.

On ground over roots, open woods and grassy places. September, 
October. Mcllvaine. 

Variable in form, but usually in rose-shaped clusters, which are 
slightly greenish at times ; oftener shades of yellow. The substance is 
the same in texture as P. intybaceus. Cook in same manner. 

P. COn'fluens Fr. stems confluent; adherent. Pile! branched, fleshy, 
fragile, thick, dimidiate, imbricated, confluent, smooth, fleshy-yellow 
becoming obscure, slightly scaly. Stem short. Pores short, minute, 
pallid-white. 

Eaten about Nice; savor a little sharp. Cordier; North Carolina, 
superior eating. Curtis. Pine woods. New Scotland. September. 

Our specimens are not at all squamulose, and this character is not 
attributed to the species by all authors. It is probable that it is not 
uniform in this respect. Peck, 39th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

P. Berk'eleyi Fr. Very much branched. Pileoli very large, subzon- 
ate, finally tomentose, yellowish, fleshy, tough becoming corky and 
hard. Stem short or none, arising from a long and thick common base 
growing out of the ground usually near trees or stumps. Pores rather 
large, irregular, angular, pale yellowish. 

A magnificent specimen found near Boston a dozen years ago and 
exhibited in the window of Doyle, the florist, was fully four feet high 
and from two to three feet broad, containing very many pileoli.

Pores minute, somewhat round, pallid, at length torn. 

The rigid cuticle separates into granules or fibrillose squamules. 
Pores becoming dark when touched. Fries. 

Edible, Curtis. Esculent when young. On the continent its esculent 
qualities are known and appreciated. Cooke. 

West Virginia, Chester county, Pa., Eagle's Mere, Pa. On decay- 
ing stumps and roots. Mcllvaine. 

It is well marked by its spore-surface becoming black to the touch. 
When young and fresh it stews to a pleasant, edible consistency, but is 
tough if not well cooked or too old. The flavor of a gravy from it is 
at all times good. 

P. SUlpllll'reilS Fr. sulphur, brimstone. (Plate CXXV, fig. 2, 
p. 476.) In many cespitose layers, 1-2 ft. and more, juicy-cheesy. 
Pile! 8 in. or more broad, reddish-yellow, imbricated, undulated, rather 
smooth. Flesh light yellowish, then white, splitting open and not 
hardened when old. Pores minute, plane, sulphur-yellow. Fries. 

Soon becoming pale. Commonly sessile, but varying with a stem, 
lateral on standing trees, but expanded on all sides on fallen ones; also 
club-shaped, porous throughout. Sow. In its fullest vigor it is filled 
with sulphur-yellow milk.

Polyporaceae 

Poiypoms. times with a short stem. Very occasionally a single pileus will protrude 
from a tree like a giant yellow tongue shaded with reddish-orange. 
Usually the pilei are in clusters united in a solid base, white-fleshed and 
rich in color. I have seen clusters two feet across. On an old willow 
at Mt. Gretna, a cluster 18 in. across afforded a dozen meals. When- 
ever a meal was wanted a pound or two was broken off. It lasted until 
January. If P. sulphureus is cooked properly it is a delicious fungus. 
Cut fine, stew slowly and well, season, add butter, milk with a little 
thickening. 

P. macula'tllS Pk. having macttfa-spots. Pileus of a cheesy con- 
sistence, broad, flattened, sometimes confluent, sessile or narrowed into 
a short stem, slightly uneven, white or yellowish-white, marked with 
darker zones and watery spots. Pores minute, subangular, short, 
whitish, sometimes tinged with brown. Flesh white. 

Pileus 4-6 in. broad, 6-8 lines thick. 

Prostrate trunks of trees in woods. Worcester. July. 

In texture and shape this species is related to P. sulphureus, but the 
pores are smaller than in that species. The plants are sometimes cespi- 
tose, sometimes single. The spots in the dried specimens have a 
smooth depressed appearance. Peck, 26th Rep. 

Angora, West Philadelphia. September, 1896. Mt. Gretna, Pa., 
September, 1897-1898. On white oak trunks. Mcllvaine. 

Several specimens of different ages proved good eating. Like P. 
sulphureus it must be well cooked. 

P. hetero'clitus Fr. Gr. one of two; Gr. , to lean. In many ces-

reared against the base of tree or stump, they deceive by their likeness 
to gaudy bouquets, left by foreign picnickers. In quality it is the same 
as P. sulphureus. It does not, however, retain its edibility. As it ages 
it becomes offensive. 

P. por'ipes Fr. porous-stemmed. Pileus i-S-3 in. broad, rather 
fleshy, sinuately repand, smooth, grayish-brown. Stem central or ex- 
centric, firm, smooth, 1.5-3 m - l n g 4-6 lines thick, punctuated by 
the whitish decurrent pores. 

On earth in hilly regions.

center, broken into minute appressed squamules, zoned. Flesh fibrous, 
white-pliable. Tubes very shallow, round mouths with obtuse divisions, 
china-white, running down to base of stem. Stem eccentric, almost 
lateral, entirely surrounded by pores, connate at base, % in. thick. 

Smell pleasant.

the ground in woods, August to November, Mcllvaine. 

When raw tastes like the best chestnuts or filberts, but rather too dry 
cooked. Curtis. 

It must be chopped fine and slowly cooked. 

P. immi'tis Pk. wide, rude. Pilei cespitose-imbricated, broad, 
slightly convex or flattened, more or less rough or uneven, radiately- 
wrinkled, tuberculose or fibrous-bristled, zoneless, white, becoming 
tinged with yellow or alutaceous in drying. Flesh white, slightly fibrous, 
soft and moist when fresh, cheesy when dry, with a subacid odor. Pores 
minute, angular or even subflexuous, about equal in length to the thick- 
ness of the pileus, the dissepiments thin, white, often at length dentate 
or lacerate on the edge. Spores minute, white, elliptical, 3-4x18-20/4. 

Pile! 2-4 in. broad, the flesh commonly 3-4 lines thick.

Polyporacese 

Poiyporus. Several clusters grew on dead black oaks. The pilei overlap and 
the wrinkled corrugated margins curve downward, giving them the 
semblance of shells. From a distance a group looks like Pleurotus 
ostreatus. The substance is juicy ; while cooking it is at first bitter, but 
this disappears. It becomes tender and well flavored. 

P. alliga'tus Fr. alligo, to bind to. In many cespitose layers, 
fibrous-fleshy, rigid-fragile. Pile! tan-isabelline, imbricated, unequal, 
zoneless, villous. Pores minute, soft, white, readily becoming stopped 
up with flocci. 

Often clavate when young. Commonly wrapping round stipules and 
grasses. Fries. 

Spores elliptical, pale, 6x//i Massee. 

Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. Among oak trees on grassy 
ground. July, August, September. Mcllvaine. 

Tufts frequently weigh two pounds. When young the plant cooks 
well, is tender and of sweet, pleasant flavor. When old it has a sour 
unpleasant odor. 

IV. APUS. 

P. chio'neus Fr. Gr. snow. White pileus I in. and more broad, 
fleshy, soft, becoming even, smooth, zoneless, often extended behind, 
margin inflexed. Pores curt, very small, round, equal, quite entire.

This snow-white Poiyporus is too conspicuous to be passed unseen. 
One does not expect to find snow-balls stuck against trees in August. 
At a distance it resembles one. When young and fresh it is good. 

P. betuli'nus Fr. betula, birch. PileilS fleshy, then corky, hoof- 
shaped, obtuse, zoneless, smooth, the oblique vertex in the form of an 
umbo, pellicle thin, separating. Pores late of being developed, curt,

Polyporaceee 

On living and dead birch. Common. May to December. Poiypoms. 

Pileus 3-6 in. broad. The pileus is at first pale, then acquiring a 
brownish tinge. The edge is always very obtuse. Stevenson. 

The lower surface or hymenium is frequently rough with numerous 
acicular projections, making the plant look like a Hydnum when viewed 
horizontally. Peck, 24th Rep. N. Y.. State Bot. 

Massachusetts, Kansas, New York. Peck, Rep. 24. 

Wherever the birch grows this neat, white-fleshed Polyporus abounds. 

When young it is eaten by deer. Dried it burns with a white flame, 
or holds fire as well as the best punk. It is a valuable fuel, already 
prepared for the stove. In the birch forests near Eagle's Mere, Pa., 
tons of it can be seen protruding from tree and log. 

When very young it is fair. Unpleasant when old. 

V. RESUPINATI. 

P. sinuo'sus Fr. full of folds. Broadly effused, adnate, dry, the 
evanescent mycelium somewhat rooting, white then yellowish. Pores 
large, surface flexuous, acute, lacerated. Odor of licorice.

Folyporaceee 

MERU'LIUS Hall. 
(Plate CXXVI, fig. 3, p. 478.) 

Merulius. Hymenophore resting on a loose mold-like mycelium, covered with 
the soft, waxy, continuous hymenium, having its surface variously 
plicate or wrinkled, the folds forming irregular pores, sometimes obso- 
letely toothed. 

Generally on wood. 

I have tasted, raw, every species I have found. They are all more 
or less woody in flavor, and I believe them to be edible. At the best 
Merulius would be an emergency genus. M. tremellosus is substantial, 
as is M. rubellus Pk. 

M. tremello'silS Schrad. tremellosus, trembling. Resupinate; mar- 
gin becoming free and more or less reflexed, usually radiately-toothed, 
gelatinoso-cartilaginous ; hymenium variously wrinkled and porous; whit- 
ish and subtranslucent looking, becoming tinged brown in the center. 
Spores cylindrical, curved, about 4x1/1.

dark places. Margin sometimes tinged rose, radiating when well de- 
veloped. Mas see.

1 899 . Mcllvaine . 

M. tremellosus is a common species and rather attractive looking. 
In substance it approaches Tremella and Peziza. The spore-bearing sur- 
face is superior (turned upward) and then sometimes turned in at the 
margin which frequently is bright rose color, sometimes yellowish-rose. 
It is rather tasteless slightly woody in flavor, rather tough. An emer- 
gency species. 

M. rubellus Pk. rubelhis, dim. of ruber, reddish. Generally cespi- 
tose, imbricated, sessile, dimidiate, soft, tenacious, tomentose, evenly 
red, pale when dry; margin mostly undulately inflexed; hymenium

Hydnaceae 



FAMILY III. HYDNA'CE^E. 

Hymenium inferior or amphigenous (not confined to one surface), 
from the first definitely protuberant, spread over persistent spines, 
bristles, teeth, tubercles or papillae. Fries. 

While the highest members of this family possess the general form of 
the mushroom, others, lacking a stem, recline on the back (resupi- 
nate) ; the lowest, without even the appearance of a distinct pileus, 
seem to be simply spread over the supporting body (effused). In the 
highest class the spines or other spore-bearing surface are inferior, i. e., 
below the pileus; in the others they are of course superior, i. e., above 
the pileus. 

Of the eleven genera but two contain species of food value. Hyd- 
num, characterized by its acute spines, embraces species which are 
eaten as delicacies, and Irpex, distinguished by its somewhat acute 
teeth growing from a ridgy hymenium, contains those which may furnish 
sustenance in time of need. In Caldesia, bearing spines, the texture is 
floccose not fleshy. Sistotrema has a pileus and a central stem, but in- 
stead of spines bears irregular flattened teeth. The remaining genera 
are separated by the tubercles, granules, folds, etc., which take the 
place of spines or teeth. 

Several species of Hydnum are common to earth and wood, others 
are distinct in their habitats.

Hydnacese 



Hydnunu 



HYD'NUM. 

Gr. name for some edible fungus. 

YMENIUM inferior, bearing awl-shaped Spines, 
distinct at the base. Fries. 

In this genus the spines proceed from an even 
surface, not folded or wrinkled, and are covered 
with the spore-bearing surface. 

The forms are extremely variable, the type of 
the first section, H. repandum, being easily mis- 
taken for one of the Agaricaceae until examined, 

the stem being nearly central and upright, while in other forms it is 
lateral or absent. Some are dimidiate (as if part of the pileus had 
been removed and the plant attached by the remaining portion) ; the 
lower forms are resupinate.

H. imbrica'tum L. imbrex, a tile. Pileus about 2-5 in. broad, Hydnum. 
umber, zoneless, fleshy, rather plane, somewhat umbilicate, fioccose, 
tessulato-scaly. Flesh dingy whitish. Stem curt, 1-3 in. long, 1-2 in. 
thick, even. Spines 4-6 lines long, decurrent, ashy-white. 

There are two forms ; one with the pileus plane and with thick per- 
sistent scales, another with the pileus somewhat infundibuliform, and 
with thinner, at length separating scales. Stevenson. 

Spores pale yellow brown, rough, 6-7x5;* Massee; 6x5/, W.G.S. 

Fleshy. The numerous scales over lapping toward the center. The 
surface of the cap often cracks in a tesselated manner. Flesh dingy, 
buffish or reddish. Spines short, blunt, grayish-white and mostly of 
equal length. 

In pine and mixed woods. Autumn. 

Of delicate taste. Cordier. Edible. Curtis. 

Fine specimens grew at Mt. Gretna, Pa., from September to Novem- 
ber. Until closely examined the cap may be mistaken for that of H. 
zonatum. The zones of the latter and the pervading rust-color will 
distinguish it. Both are edible, though H. zonatum is much tougher. 
H. imbricatum is slightly bitter, raw. It must be sliced thin and well 
cooked. 

H. Iseviga'tum Swartz lavis, smooth. Pileus 4-6 in. broad, um- 
ber, fleshy, compact, firm, regular, plane, even, very smooth, margin 
circinate (not repand). Flesh whitish, compact, but by no means 
fibrous, soft when fresh, pliant when dry. Stem short, thick, even, 
pallid-brown. Spines thin, pallid-brown. 

Its size is that of H. imbricatum, but it occurs twice as large, with 
the pileus minutely rimuloso-rivulose, by no means scaly. The stem 
varies curt and unequal or longer and equal. Quite distinct from H. 
fragile. Stevenson.

Hydnum scabrosum is frequently found in Pennsylvania, among pines 

and in mixed woods where pines grow. It occurs at Mt. Gretna, Pa., 

and on Springton Hills under hemlocks. 

The caps are soft, fleshy, and equal to H. repandum in quality. 

H. squamo'sum Schaeff. squama, a scale. Pileus 1-^-3 in. across, 
reddish-brown, fleshy, irregular, depressed, smooth, breaking up into 
irregular scales. Flesh whitish. Stem curt, attenuated downward,

light in color. 

July to November. 

Edible. Curtis. 

Common to most countries, and, although given as a ground-growing 
species, it is rather indiscriminate in its habitats. Woods, fields, leaf- 
covered or bare places, much decayed wood and stumps are its living 
places. Dr. Cooke thinks it irreproachable. Popularly it goes by the 
name of the Hedgehog mushroom. 

H. repandum varies greatly in shape, color and texture. In the open 
it is usually symmetrical and tough ; when clustered it is irregular, often 
fanciful and quite brittle tender. 

When sliced thin an hour's slow cooking is sufficient. All writers 
commend it, and properly. 

H. rufes'cens Pers. ntfus, red. Pileus 2-3 in. across, thin, fragile, 
usually regular, pubescent, reddish. Spines 1-3 lines long, regular.

repandum. Usually more regular. 

Commonly found in woods. New York, Peck; North Carolina,

Edible, Curtis. Edible, Leuba. 

Fries considered H. rufescens a variety of H. repandum, and the 
writer agrees with him. It is given distinct place here because Massee 
and Stevenson books in the hands of many students of fungi give it 
importance. 

It is quite as good as H. repandum. 

H. ferrugi'neum Fr. Pileus 1-4 in- across, cor^y, soft, convex, 
then plane or depressed, irregularly pitted, ferruginous, at first with 
whitish tomentum. Flesh ferruginous. Spines thin, acute, about 2 
lines long, rusty-brown. Stem firm, 2-3 in. long, unequal, rusty- 
brown. Spores subglobose, 4/1, diameter. 

In fir woods. Often gregarious; soft when young, corky and dry at 
maturity. Massee.

H. velle'reum Pk. This species appears to be very much like the 
preceding one (H. albonigrum Pk.) from which it is separated by its 
smaller size and the paler brownish or rusty-brown substance of its 
pileus and stem. Peck, 5oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

At Mt. Gretna, Pa., the species grows with H.. albonigrum. In 
quality it is the same.

plane, subpruinose, white. Flesh 
white. Spines short, white. Stem 
short, solid, central or eccentric, white. 
Spores subglobose, 4-5/4 broad. 

The whitish Hydnum is uniformly 
colored in all parts. It grows in 
groups or in clusters. In the latter 
case the caps are sometimes irregular 
because of the crowded mode of 
growth and the stems are occasionally 
eccentric. It is a small species not 
liable to be mistaken for any other 
except possibly for very small pale 

forms of the spreading Hydnum. But wholly white examples of this 
species have never been seen by me. 

The caps are 1-2 in. broad and the stems are generally about I in. 
long and 3-5 lines thick.

HYDNUM ALBIDUM. 



Hyduaceae 

Hydnum. The plants grow in thin woods or in open bushy places and appear in 
June and July. It is not a common species, and though well flavored 
it is not of very great importance as an edible mushroom, because of its 
scarcity and small size. Peck, 5ist Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Port Jefferson. July. This fungus has been tested and found to be 
edible. Peck, 5oth Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897. Specimens identified by Professor Peck. 
Mcllvaine. 

The caps are edible and superior to H. repandum. 

H. fen'nicum Karst. Cap fleshy, fragile, unequal, at first scaly, at 
length breaking up, reddish-brick color becoming darker, margin 
undulately lobed, 2-4 in. broad. Flesh white. Stem sufficiently 
stout, unequal below, attenuated, flexuous or curved, smooth, of the 
same color as the cap, base acute, light white tomentum outside, inside 
light pale-blue or dark-gray (wood-ash), 1-3 in. long 1 , .4-1 in. thick. 
Teeth decurrent, equal, pointed, from white dusky, about 4 mm. long. 
Spores ellipso-spheroidical or sub-spheroidical, rough, dusky, 4-6)". long, 
3-5/u, broad. 

Found in gravelly or sandy soil in woods. 

Found at Angora near Philadelphia. Top cracked. Identified by 
Professor Peck. 

Occurs frequently at Mt. Gretna, Pa., ground in mixed woods. 
August to September. The taste and smell are at first inviting, but 
the extreme bitter which develops destroys all desire to eat it. 

H. spongio'sipes Pk. Pileus convex, soft, spongy-tomentose, but 
tough in texture, rusty-brown, the lower stratum more firm and fibrous, 
but concolorous. Spines slender, 1-2 lines long, rusty-brown, becom- 
ing darker with age. Stem hard and corky within, externally spongy- 
tomentose, colored like the pileus, the central substance often trans- 
versely zoned especially near the top. Spores subglobose, nodulose, 
purplish-brown, 4-6/4 broad. 

Pileus 1.5-4 in. broad. Stem 1.5-3 in. long, 4-8 lines thick. 

Woods. Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. August.

Edible. Curtis. 

Grows upon standing and fallen timber which is attacked by decay. 
Fir, oak, beech, ash, birch, hickory and other trees are inhabited by it. 
August to frost. 

This beautiful species can not be mistaken for any other. Its name 
is the best guide to its identification. Dame Nature has made many 
exquisite decorations for herself and this is one of them. 

It is generally eaten, but is rare. Professor Peck speaks affectionately 
of it as a gratuitous adjunct to his bill of fare when on botanical tramps 
in the Adirondacks. 

H. capnt-ur'si Fr. bear-head. 6-8 in. high, 6-8 in. across. Tufts 
usually pendulous, compact, white, becoming yellow and brownish. 
Spines up to I in. long, round, pointed. Branches in every direction, 
short. (Plate CXXXIVa.) 

Closely resembling H. coralloides and in small forms with shorter 
spines easily mistaken for it. Position of growth has much to do with

Hydnum caput-ursi is common in West Virginia forests. It is con- 
spicuous on standing oaks, and at a distance a puzzling object to one 
not familiar with such excrescences. It grows on standing oaks near 
Haddonfield, N. J., and sparsely at Mt. Gretna, Pa. 

It is more compact, and is tougher than H. coralloides and H. Me- 
dusae, but cooks tender and is very good. 

H. caput-Medll'sse Bull. head of Medusae. (Plate CXXXV.) 
318 in. across, 28 in. high. Tufts pendulous. White then grayish. 
Body compact, tapering to a solid base, more or less stem-like. Spines 
covering entire surface. Those upon top are long, thin, straight or 
distorted, growing shorter around and to the under side where they 
are short and straight. The wavy appearance of the slender spines re- 
mind of the snaky locks of Medusa, hence the name. 

Edible. Curtis. Edible. Leuba. 

On elms at Haddonfield, N. J. ; on oaks at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and in 
Woodland Cemetery, and on elms in Washington Square, Philadelphia, 
Pa. Mcllvaine. 

Commonly eaten in Italy and parts of Austria ; rare elsewhere in 
Europe. Occurring over the United States. Specimens eighteen 
inches across were seen by the writer in the West Virginia mountains. 

Mr. H. I. Miller, Terre Haute, Ind., sent me a fine specimen weigh- 
ing loK pounds. 

The American species, as far as seen by the writer, changes to a light 
yellow when ageing. The entire fungus is edible and excellent, but the 
tender spines and more delicate parts make a dish equaled by few fungi. 

H. erina'ceum Bull. erinaceus, a hedgehog. 2-8 in. and more 
across. Tufts pendulous. White and yellowish-white becoming yel- 
low-brownish, fleshy, elastic, tough, sometimes emarginate (broadly 
attached as if tuft was cut in two, sliced off where attached), a mass of 
latticed branches and fibrils. Spines i ^-4 in. long, crowded, straight, 
equal, pendulous. Stem sometimes rudimentary.

A dead beech trunk at Eagle's Mere, Pa., in August, 1898, bore at 
least fifty pounds of it. It draped one side of the tree from root to top 
with yellowish, pendulous tufts, with spines up to 3 in. long, which 
waved in the wind. The spines and tender parts were stewed, and en- 
joyed by many. It shrinks very much in drying, becoming sour.

The largest known Hydnum. 

Received from E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J., September, 1897. 
The specimens formed part of a dense fasciculate mass weighing over 
20 pounds, growing on a beech stump. Edges of the young plant are 
edible, but have little taste. 




503 



Hydnaceae 

IRTEX Fr. 

A harrow. 

Irpex. Hymenium inferior, toothed from the first. Teeth firm, somewhat 
coriaceous, acute, concrete with the pileus, arranged in rows or like 
network, connected at the base by folds, which are gill-like (in sessile 
species) or resemble honeycomb (in resupinate ones). Sporophores 
4-spored. Growing on wood, somewhat growing from the side or upon 
the back, approaching Lenzites and Daedaleae. 

Irpex differs from Hydnum in having the spines connected at the 
base, and in their being less awl-shaped and pointed. 

It is reported as found well up in the northern States, but its species 
prefer warm climates. Irpex contains no choice species, but all I have 
tested can be eaten. 

I. obli'qilUS Fr. oblique. White, inclining to pale, effused (spread), 
forming an adnate crust, circumference flaxy. Teeth extended from a 
base resembling honeycomb, compressed, unequal ', incised, oblique, 23 
lines long. 

At first abundantly porous, but toothed from the first, at length quite 
as in Hydna. 

On stumps and dead branches. November to February. Stevenson. 

This spreads in irregular patches on the surface of decaying wood. 
The pores for a small space round the margin are round and distinct, 
but toward the center are greatly lengthened out, lying one upon an- 
other in an imbricated manner. The color is white at first, when old it 
changes to a yellow-brown, and at last to a dirty fuscous black. Bolton. 

At first it looks more like a small white orbicular resupinate Poly- 
porus than an Irpex. Peck. 

The species is common and can be collected at most times of the 
year. When fresh and moist it can be shaved from its host plant. 
Goodly quantities can thus be obtained. It stews to a firm gelatinous 
mass of pleasant flavor. The lost hunter need not die of starvation in 
any woods if he will but study the tree-growing fungi, and especially 
the small species, hitherto insignificant in food circles. 

I. car'neus Fr. resembling the color of flesh. Reddish, effused, I-

Angora, Philadelphia, September, 1897. Mel lvalue. 

The entire fungus is good, cooking like a Hydnum. 

L defor'mis Fr. deformed. White, effused, crustaceous, thin, cir 
cumference pubescent, somewhat flaxy. Teeth extended in awl-shape 
from a minutely porous base, thin, somewhat digitato-incised (cut in 
finger-shape), 1-2 lines long. Fries. 

It approaches the Polypori. Grows on wood. Stevenson. 

North Carolina, Schweinitz, Curtis; Massachusetts, Frost. 

Common on stumps and trees. The awl-shaped teeth, which have 
the appearance of shreds, can be scraped from the fresh plant, or if 
dried plants are moistened, the teeth are detachable, and are food-giving. 

I. flLSCO-viola'ceus Fr. fuscus, brown; violaceoiis, violet. Pileus 
2 in. long, more than I in. broad, white inclining to hoary, effuso- 
reflexed, coriaceous, silky, zoned. Teeth in rows in the form of plates, 
brownish-violet, incised at the apex. Fries. 

On pine trunks. Stevenson. 

Decaying trunks of spruce, abies nigra. Adirondack mountains. 
July. 

Our specimens are not "silky," as required by the description, but 
villose or tomentose-villose as in Polyporus hirsutus and P. abietinus, 
the latter of which this species closely resembles. The hymenium, 
however, is coarser, more highly colored and lamellated to such an 
extent that young specimens might easily be taken for a Lenzites. 
Peck, 30th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Found in West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. 
Mcllvaine. 

Very common on logs of coniferous trees. It is difficult to collect it 
entirely free from resin, which as a seasoning is not recommended.

Thelephoraceee 



FAMILY IV. THELEPHORA'CE-ffi Fr. 

Gr. a teat; Gr. to bear. 

Sporophore erect and stipitate, with a central stem, effused, with the 
upper portion free and bent backward, or entirely resupinate. Hyme- 
nilllll perfectly even or radiately wrinkled, glabrous or minutely bristled 
with projecting cystidia; basidia normally 4-spored. Spores without 
a division, colorless or colored. Massee. 

In Thelephoraceae are shapes closely resembling those found in Hyd- 
naceae, Polyporaceae and Agaricaceae. The genus Craterellus is closely 
allied to Cantharellus, and, though the spore surface is much less 
wrinkled or veined, resembles it in several of its species. Other types 
show likeness to Merulius in Polyporaceae ; others to Tremellineae and 
Clavariaceae. Many puzzles are presented by its species, but the solv- 
ing is interesting. 

Though populous it contains but few edibles. The best of them is 
Craterellus cornucopoides.

Thelephoracesa 

CRATEREL'LUS Fr. 

Crater, a bowl. 

Cratereiius. Hymenium waxy-membranaceous, distinct but adnate to the hymeno- 
phore, inferior, continuous, smooth, even or wrinkled. Spores white. 
Fries. 

This, the only genus of Thelephoracese containing edible fungi, has 
the form and general appearance of Cantharellus to which it is allied, 
but it is distinguished by its nearly even hymenium, which in Canthar- 
ellus has the form of gills, fold-like and thick but still distinctly gills. 
The species vary from fleshy to membranaceous, all having a funnel- 
shaped pileus and stem merging into it. On the ground. Autumn. 
The slightly veined surface where the spores are borne, and the spores 
themselves, when a microscope is brought to bear upon them, distin- 
guish this genus from Cantharellus; and its thin flesh and funnel-shape 
from the large forms of Pistillaria. Several of the species are edible. 
It is probable that all are. 

Toadstools, despite their name, are more popularly associated with 
fairies than with toads. "Fairy rings," "Fairy Bread" and "Fairy 
Clubs" are titles belonging to them, and these link us to the pretty be- 
lief of childhood a belief we often do not outgrow. A group of C. 
lutescens or C. cornucopoides may well be likened to fairy trumpets, 
or to a tiny orchestrion thrusting its horns through wood earth where 
roots of stumps abound. 

C. Cantharellus Schw. (Plate XLVI, fig. 3.) Cap 1-3 in.

35 lines thick, glabrous, solid, yellow. Spores on white paper yel- 
lowish or pale salmon. 

Spores 7.5-10x5-6^ Peck. 

West Virginia, Mcllvaine. 

No one not looking for minute botanic details would separate this 
species from Cantharellus cibarius, especially if found growing near or 
with it. The pinkish tinge sometimes present in C. Cantharellus I have 
never observed in C. cibarius. The present species is of equal excel- 
lence.

PLATE CXXXVI. 




Thelephoraceae 

C. COrmiCOpoi'des Pers. cornu and copies, horn of plenty. (Plate Cratereiius. 
CXXXVI, fig. 8, p. 508.) Cap dark sooty shades of gray or brown 
shades of well-worn velveteen 1-2 in. across, whole plant from 2-4 
in. high, trumpet-shaped, or like a funnel with its open mouth, plane, 
wavy, split or in folds. Substance very thin and either brittle or tough. 
The inside is sometimes minutely scaly, the opening extending to the 
base; outside, where the spores are borne, it has neither gills, pores nor 
protuberances, but a slightly uneven surface varying little in color. 
Stem obsolete or seldom noticeable. Odor slight. 

Spores pointed, 1 1-12x7-8/4 Massee. 

Grows single, clustered or in troops along shaded roads, or from leaf 
mold and ground in woods. July to frost. 

Large patches, clustered, grow near stumps in moist places on Bo- 
tanic Creek, West Philadelphia. It is plentiful near Haddonfield, N. 
J., at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and many other places in the United States. 

It is not pleasant to look upon, because of its peculiar color, but 
when one gets used to it it has an attractiveness of its own. Its graceful 
shape, even its funereal hue and name Trompet du Morte are alluring. 

It dries well, and when moistened expands to its normal size. It is 
a first-class edible fungus. It should be stewed slowly until tender. 

C. clava'tus Fr. clava, a club. Pileus 2 in. broad, somewhat light- 
yellowish, fleshy, top-shape, truncate or depressed, flexuous, unpolished, 
attenuated into the solid stem. Flesh thick, white. Hymenium even, 
then corrugated, purplish then changing color. Fries. 

Spores elliptical, pale-yellow, 10- 12x4-5^ Massee. 

Professor Peck notes that the species so closely resembles Cantharellus 
cibarius that it might easily be mistaken for a deformed condition of it. 

The resemblance to the yellow forms of Clavaria pistillaria is marked. 

Massachusetts, Sprague, Farlow ; New York, Peck, Rep. 32; West 
Virginia, Pennsylvania, Mcllvaine. 

An excellent species. Its scarcity is regrettable. 

C. du'bius Pk. Pileus infundibuliform, subfibrillose, lurid-brown, 
pervious to the base, the margin generally wavy and lobed. Hymenium 
dark cinereous, rugose when moist, the minute crowded irregular folds 
abundantly anastomosing, nearly even when dry. Stem short. Spores 
broadly elliptical or subglobose, 6-7.5/4 long. 

509 



Thelephoraceae 

Cratereiius. Plant simple or cespitose, 2~3 in. high. PileilS 1-2 in. broad. 

Ground under spruce trees. Adirondack mountains. August. 

In color this species bears some resemblance to Cantharellus cinereus. 
From Cratereiius sinuosus it is separated by its pervious stem, and from 
C. cornucopoides by its more cespitose habit, paler color and smaller 
spores. Peck, 3ist Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Mcllvaine. 

Its edible qualities are in every way equal to those of C. cornuco- 
poides. 

C. Sinuo'sus Fr. sinus, a curve. Strong scented. Pileus funnel- 
shaped, downy, grayish-brown, margin undulated. Stem pale yellow, 
elongated, stuffed. Hymenium with anastomosing ribs, grayish. 
Spores elliptical, pale yellow, 8-9x5/4. 

In woods, Pileus K i in. high and broad. Stem about I in. high, 
sometimes very short. Smell strong, musky. Hymenium becoming 
tan-color when dry. Pileus more or less villose. Massee. 

The above description is given so that Var. crispus which follows 
may be compared with it. Fries considered var. crispus a good species. 

Var. crispus crispus, curled. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 7, p. 508.) 
Margin of hymenium sinuous and crisped. Pileus pervious. Stem 
stuffed at base only. Hymenium almost even. Massee. 

Solitary and cespitose in mixed woods. 

Found by Dr. S. C. Schmucker near West Chester, Pa., 1896; Wm. 
H. Rarer, Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1897. 

Cap varies in color from dark to light brownish-gray. Gills brown- 
ish-gray, almost even. Stem hollow, dark yellow. Smell strong, 
musky, much like A. silvicola. 

Substance tender and of markedly high and pleasant flavor. 




Clavariaceee 



FAMILY V. CLAVARIA'CEJE. 

Hymenium not distinct from the hymenophore, covering entire outer 
surface. Somewhat fleshy, not coriaceous, vertical, simple or branched. 
Fries. 

For the most part growing upon the ground. 

In this family there is no separation into stem and pileus, with the 
spore-bearing surface restricted to gills or tubes, but the substance of 
the plant is continuous, and the spores are produced on the clubs or 
branches. 

But three genera Clavaria, Sparassis and Pistillaria include species 
of food value. They are easily recognized. 

The genus Calcocera resembles Clavaria in form, but is very different 
in material, being a jelly-like viscid, cartilaginous substance, horny 
when dry, resembling that of Tremella. 

SYNOPSIS OF GENERA. 

SPARASSIS. Page 5 12. 
Very much branched, branches compressed, plate-like, crisped. 

TYPHULA. 
Simple or club-shaped, with a thread-like stem. 

CLAVARIA . Page 513. 

Fleshy, simple or branched, branches typically round, some forms 
club-shaped. 

PISTILLARIA. 

Club-shaped, simple, rigid when dry; usually minute. 

PTERULA. 

Branches numerous, slender, forming a tuft, or single, leathery, round 
or compressed. 



'Clavariace 

SPARAS'SIS Fr. 

Gr. to tear in pieces. 

Sparassis. Fleshy, branched, with flat leaf-like branches, composed of two plates, 
fertile on both sides, with four-spored sporophores. Fries. 

Very beautiful plants of striking appearance. 

Unfortunately they are not common, although they generally occur 
yearly in the same locality. 

S. Herb'stii Pk. Plants much branched, forming tufts 4-5 in. high 
and 56 in. broad, whitish, inclining to creamy-yellow, tough, moist, 
the branches numerous, thin, flattened, concrescent, dilated above and 
spatulate or fan-shaped, often somewhat longitudinally curved or wavy, 
mostly uniformly colored, rarely with a few indistinct, nearly concolor- 
ous, transverse zones near the broad, entire apices. 

Spores subglobose or broadly elliptical, 5-6x4-5^1. 

Trexlertown. August. 

Closely allied to S. spathulata Schw., but differs in its paler color 
with no rufescent hues, more branching habit and absence of any dis- 
tinct zones. 

Four specimens were found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., during August, 1898. 
These were not as symmetrical as S. crispa, which they closely resem- 
bled in fold and texture. They were of equal excellence cooked. 

S. lamino'sa Fr. a thin plate. Base branching, straw-color. 
Branches erect, crowded, growing together, straight at the top, zone- 
less, entire. 

North Carolina, Curtis. On oak log. 

Edible, Curtis. "Deliciosa," Fries. 

S. cris'pa ^r.crispus, curly. (Plate CXXXVII.) Height 3-12 
in., width 4-24 in. Tufts very handsome, whitish, oyster color or pale- 
yellow, very much branched. Branches flat, leaf-like. Spore surface 
on both sides, sometimes crimped on edges. Compacted into a round 
mass, ending below in a solid rooting base. 

Spores pale-ochraceous, 5-6x3-4/4 Massee. 

Very variable in size. On ground in woods and grassy places in 
open woods. Summer, autumn.

Clavariaceae 

North Carolina, Curtis; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Mcllvaine. 

Have seen it 2 ft. across. " Delicosissima." Fries. 

A perfect specimen of S. crispa resembles a huge rosette, round and 
many-folded in tortuous design. The folds are wide, flattened branches 
springing from a common base, thin, semi-transparent, not unlike damp 
sheets of gelatine although thicker. Surfaces of the leaves are dull, like 
the flattened seaweeds and the light-colored sea-rock mosses. S. crispa 
may be easily dried, and though shrinking much in size, retains its 
shape, forming a very pretty ornament for the desk of the mycologist. 
It is not common. Where it has chosen a habitat several tufts may be 
found during the moderate season. The writer found three specimens 
ranging from 6-12 in. in diameter near Haddonfield, N. J., others, not 
as large, in West Virginia and in Chester county, Pa. 

It has long been known as edible. It makes an ever-to-be-remem- 
bered dish. 



CLAVA'RIA L. 

Clava, a club. 

Fleshy, branched or simple, somewhat round, without a distinct stem, ciavaria. 
Hymenium continuous, dry, homogeneous. For the, most part growing 
mi ground. Fries. 

The members of this genus vary greatly in form, which in some is 
that of a club growing singly or cespitose, while others present a more 
or less bush-like appearance, being slightly or excessively branched. 

The color of the plant covers a wide range, as it may be white, red, 
yellow, violet or their various shades, and to be in harmony the spores 
do not confine themselves to one color, but are white, ochraceous or 
cinnamon. In cases where the plant is not otherwise well defined the 
spore colors will be found a valuable aid in placing it.

. Excepting to toadstool hunters the Clavaria, though numerous, are 
not known to those who "Know a toadstool when they see it." They 
bear no semblance to the stereotyped toadstool. They seem to possess 
an imitative faculty. Those growing among grasses harmonize with 
the faded stalks under debris or the bleached surfaces of blades famish- 
ing for sunlight ; those of the woods take on the color of the leaf mat or 
of the lichens, and shapes of club and deer-horn mosses, or assemble in 
groves as pigmy trees, boled and sturdy-branched in mimicry of their 
giant protectors towering above them. In their forms many are deli- 
cate, graceful, beautiful, others are intricate. There is fascination for 
eye and brain in looking through the vistas and labyrinths of their 
branches. 

A few species are tough as shoe-strings; a few bitter; one, C. dicho- 
toma, on the authority of Leuba, contains a minor poison. The genus 
is plentiful and reliable. Many individuals are of marked excellence. 
In soups, stews, patties, they remind one of noodles; sometimes of 
macaroni. The hard parts of the stem should be removed, the branches 
broken or cut in % in. lengths. If stewed, they require time and slow 
cooking; if fried in butter they are crisp, choice bits.

Clavariaceee 

Height 2-4 in., 2-4 in. across; pale-yellow, dingy-yellow. Stem ciavana. 
or trunk short, robust, whitish. Branches very numerous, dense, 
fragile, erect, straight, lighter than the yellow tips (fading with age) 
which are toothed. Flesh white. Spores white. Taste and odor 
pleasant. 

Woods and open places. June to frost. 

Indiana, H, I. Miller; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Mcllvaine. 

The C. fiava and C. botrytes have long been noted edible species, 
liberally commended abroad and in the United States. Variations in 
their structure are interchangeable ; variations in their quality are due 
to environment. There is a slight difference in the measurement of 
their spores, but the difference is not so great as between spores of the 
same specimen. Specific differences may exhibit themselves in young 
plants, yet disappear with age. 

Plants for the table should be young and fresh. When aged or when 
the ravages of insects appear, they should not be used, as they then 
have an unpleasant taste which will effect a whole dish. 

They should be cut into small pieces and stewed slowly for fully thirty 
minutes. They can be seasoned and eaten as a stew or made into 
patties. 

C. botry'tes Pers. Gr. a cluster of grapes (from shape). Height 
34 in., 36 in. across, white, yellow, pinkish, dingy in shades of these 
colors. Base thick, short, fleshy, unequal. Branches many, swollen, 
thick, crowded, unequal, enlarged at the ends and divided into several 
small branchlets which are sometimes reddish at tips. Flesh white. 

Spores ellipsoid, sub-transparent, white, 8x5/4 Massee, 

On wood earth. Common. 

New York, Peck, Rep. 24; West Virginia, New Jersey, Mcllvaine. 

A general favorite and highly esteemed in Europe. Edible. Curtis. 

"When old the branches both of this species and of C. flava become 
elongated, obtuse, very fragile, and of a uniform color. The yellow 
tips of the latter and the red ones of the former species wholly dis- 
appear." Peck, 32d Rep. 

Excepting when young (not always then) the red tips to the branch- 
lets can not be relied upon as distinctive features of this species. The 
place of its growth and the character of the soil have very much to do

ciavaria. with its size, and the color and quality of its flesh. A well-shaded thin- 
soiled spot will, after a rain, grow pale, spindling, tender bunches, 
having but a tinge of red upon the points; perhaps not any. A rich, 
better lighted spot will produce more robust and highly colored plants. 
The same can be said of C. flava. C. botrytes is plentiful in Pennsyl- 
vania, New Jersey, West Virginia and like latitudes. It must be well 
cooked. 

C. amethys'tina Bull. amethyst in color. (Plate CXXXIX, fig. i,

most simple. Branches round, even, fragile, smooth, obtuse, known 
by its color. 

Spores elliptical, pale ochraceous, sub- transparent, 10-12x6-7/1, 
Massee. 

Common in open woods and grassy places. 

New York, Peck 3Oth Rep. ; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jer-

Eaten in Europe, and by some preferred to any other. 

A handsome species, very brittle, and though large, delicate. 

C. fastigia'ta fastigium, the top. Height 1-2 in., tufted, yellow. 
Branches numerous, flexible, tough, equal, fastigiate (branches point- 
ing upward), sometimes short and simple, when higher very much 
branched. 

Spores white, irregularly globose, 4-6/4 Massee. 

In pastures and grassy places, during warm months. 

North Carolina, Curtis; California, West Virginia, New Jersey, Penn- 
sylvania, Mcllvaine. 

Commonly eaten throughout Europe. In Germany they call it 
Ziegenbart goat's beard. 

This is one of the species that has to be looked for. Grass tufts hide 
it. Its yellowish stools are not unlike them in color. It is freely found, 
and, though not of the best, well rewards the seeker. 

C. niUSCOi'des muscus, moss. Height i-iK in., slightly tufted,

ous, repeatedly forked, straight, closely pressed, tips pointed. 

Spores dark cinnamon, Fries; creamy yellow 4x6/4 W.G.S. 

Var. fumida. The whole plant is a dingy, smoky-brownish hue, 
otherwise of the typical form. Catskill mountains. September. In 
the fresh state the specimens appear very unlike the ordinary form, but 
in the dried state they are scarcely to be distinguished. Peck, 4ist 
Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Eaten in Germany. 

This form occurs in West Virginia mountains and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., 
Trenton, N. J., in August and September, among leaves in mixed 
woods. It compares favorably with the ordinary run of Clavaria. 

C. dicho'toma God. dividing by pairs. Cespitose, white; branches 
regularly dividing by pairs, elongated, flexuous, diverging, somewhat 
compressed, extremities obtuse, rounded at or just below the apex 
broadly compressed. 

On the ground, under beeches. 

"Notwithstanding its beauty this is dangerous. In 1883, when it 
was very plentiful, I saw entire families sick from it and in 1888 there 
was a repetition with new victims.

C. fusifor'mis Sow. fusus, a spindle. (Plate CXXXVIII, fig. i, 
p. 514.) Yellow, cespitoso-connate, slightly firm, soon hollow. Clubs 
somewhat fusiform, simple and toothed, even, attenuated to the base 
which is of the same color. Stevenson. 

Spores pale yellow, globose, 4~5/* Massee. 

Closely resembles C. inaequalis Fl. Dan. 

Woods and pastures. August to November. 

Received from E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J., August, 1897. 

The clubs are -^g- in. through, 4 in. high, light clear yellow, trans- 
lucent, clustered in groups of four or five united at the base. 

Tender, well flavored, cooks easily. 

C. auran'tio-cinnabari'no Schw. aurantius, orange; cinnabaris, 
vermilion. Orange-red; base white with a sub-hairy powder; clubs 
simple, flexuous, fleshy, somewhat tenacious, fasciculate, thickened in 
the middle and attenuated toward either end, at first cylindrical then 
compressed, 67 mm. thick, 2-4 in. high. 

Pennsylvania. On the ground among rhododendrons. 

Received from E. B. Sterling, Trenton, N. J. 

The plant when fresh is a beautiful rose color, inclining to orange at 
the tips. It reminds one of the peach-blow vase color in some of its 
shades. The single clubs, growing in cluster, to the height of four 
inches, graceful in outline, exquisitely shaded, are a sight one lingers 
over. While they invite the mycophagist to eat them, his voracity is 
checked by their beauty. They are tender and delicious. It is regret- 
table that thus far it has not been reported in quantity. 

C. insequal'is Fl. Dan. unequal. Height 2-3 in. club-shaped, 
yellow, gregarious, single or in loose tufts, fragile, stuffed. Clubs club- 
shaped or almost equal, simple, sometimes forked or variously cut at 
tip, one color. 

Spores colorless, elliptical, 9-10x5/4 Massee. 

523 



Clavariaceee 

ciavaria. Woods and pastures. August to October. 

Distinguished from C. fusiformis by the tips not being sharp-pointed 
and colored. 

North Carolina, Schweinitz; New Jersey, Sterling. 

This Ciavaria is quite common in New Jersey. Its clusters are clear 
bright yellow and conspicuously pretty. The clubs are translucent and 
smooth. Excepting in color it resembles C. aurantio-cinnabarino. In 
the many specimens seen there was nothing to suggest the propriety of 
the name, excepting height of clubs. 

A dish of it is a delicacy. 



C. vermicula'ris Scop. vermis, a worm. Height 1-2 K in., white, 
tufted. Clubs simple, quill-shaped, stuffed, awl-shaped, brittle, pointed. 

Spores white, elliptical, 4x3/4 Massee. 

New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Thin grassy woods 
and among grass. July to October. 

Edible. Cordier. 

Common in southern New Jersey, and in warm soils from June to 
frost. When growing among grass it is not conspicuous and is often 
missed unless specially sought for. Its purity, its choice of refreshing 
abode, its excellent qualities, make it select among Ciavaria. 

HOLOCO'RYNE. Gr. entire; Gr. a club. 
Clubs almost simple, distinct at the base. 

C. pistillar'is L.pistilhim, a pestle. (Plate CXXXVIII, figs. 2, 
3, p. 514.) Height 2-12 in., up to I in. and more thick, color light 
yellow, ochraceous, brownish, chocolate. Clubs Indian-club shape, 
ovate-rounded, puckered at top, simple, fleshy, white within, spongy, 
exterior smooth or more or less wrinkled, usually with smooth base. 

Spores white, 10x5/1 W.G.S.; 9-1 1x5-6/4 Massee. 

Mixed woods, moss and grassy places. August until November. 

North Carolina, Pennsylvania, California, Alabama. 

Eaten in Poland, Russia and Germany. 

The writer first found this truly club-like species in West Virginia in 
1882, and ate it. But few specimens were found, and those of a dark 
chocolate color. At Mount Gretna in 1897 an< 3 1898 the yellow va-

Clavariaceae 

riety grew in considerable quantity from July until after frost. The ciavaria. 
largest specimen found measured 5)^ in. and was I in. in diameter at 
its thickest part. The average height is 2% in. Both varieties grew 
in mixed woods from the leaf-covered ground. They are often clus- 
tered, four or five together, and of different sizes. The surface, especi- 
ally of the dark variety, is regularly, vertically wrinkled, truncated in 
few places, very much resembling that of the Craterellus cantharellus. 
The stems of both are white. The apex of the clubs is folded inward 
as though pulled by drawing-strings. 

The flesh is soft, white, fine grained. A slight bitter is present in the 
dark variety, when raw, which entirely disappears upon cooking. This 
is one of the best of Clavariae. 

C. clava'ta Pk. Simple, straight, clavate, obtuse, smooth, not hol- 
low, yellow when fresh, rugose-wrinkled and orange-colored when dry, 
4-6 lines high. 

Damp shaded banks by road-sides. Sandlake. June. Peck, 25th 
Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Patches of it are conspicuous golden-hued upon somber back- 
ground. They are seen at Eagle's Mere, Mt. Gretna, and on the 
Springton Hills, Pa., along wooded road-sides. Raw, they have a mild, 
pleasant flavor, and have the same when cooked. A small species sel- 
dom found in sufficient quantity to make a comforting dish.

Tremellaceee 



FAMILY VI. TREMELLA'CEJE Fr. 

Whole fungus homogeneous, gelatinous, shrivelling when dry, reviv- 
ing when moistened, pervaded internally with branched filaments, 
terminating toward the surface all round in sporophores. Spores trans- 
parent, from globose to sausage-shape and curved, sometimes septate. 
Fries. 

The Tremellaceae, as their name signifies, tremble, because jelly-like 
when moist. They are hard, tough, horny when dry, but swell and 
become gelatinous when wet. In the typical genus, Tremella, there is 
often but little consistency. Whoever has climbed an old rail fence on 
a rainy day has had the doubtful pleasure of acquaintance with some of 
them. Sections for the microscope are obtainable by hardening them 
in alcohol. 

There are several edible species in the family. They are good in 
soups, giving them flavor and body, and some are excellent when 
stewed.

Tremellaceee 



Sub-Family AuriculariesBr 

HIKNE'OLA Fr. 

Hirnea, a small jug. 

Gelatinous, rather cartilaginous, soft and tremulous when moist, but 
not distended with jelly, horny when dry, becoming somewhat cartila- 
ginous when moistened. The hard skin forming the hymenium, which 
covers the cup-shaped cavity and is of a different color, can be sepa- 
rated entire after a thorough soaking in water. Sporophores (spore- 
bearing processes) not involved in jelly. Spores oblong, curved. Fries. 

A very peculiar and distinct genus separated from the neighboring 
genera by its disk-like, somewhat cup-shaped cavity and by its not be- 
ing distended with jelly. 



(Plate CXLIII.) 



H. auri'cula-Jllde'a (Linn.) Berk. Jew's ear. 1-4 in. across, thin, 

and flexible when moist, hard when dry, 
date-brown or blackish. Hymenium veno- 
so-plicate (vein-plaited), forming irregu- 
lar depressions such as are in the ear, yel- 
lowish-gray or grayish beneath and hairy. 
The large depressions or corrugations 
branch from smaller ones near the center of 
the plant. 

Spores 20-25x7-9/4 Massee. 
H. auricula-Judea is not very particular 
in the trees it patronizes. Elm, maple, 
hickory, balsam-fir, spruce, alder bear it. 
When the plant grows on upright timber it 
usually turns upward. It is not generally 
reported in the United States. 

Ohio, Maryland, Miss Banning; Indi-

Ilvaine. Extensively used in China, where eating it probably ante- 
dates all European records by several thousand years. It is brought 
there dried from Tahiti in great quantities and made into soup. 

The writer has found and eaten several specimens of it. It is not as 
tender as other gelatinous species, but it is an oddity that pleases.

HlRHEOLA AURICULA-JUDKA. 

A.bout two-thirds nat. size. 



Tremellacese 
Sub-Family Tremellineae. 

TREMEL'LADill. 

Tremo to tremble. 

Distended with jelly when moist, tremulous, without a defined mar- Tremeiia. 
gin and without nipple-like elevations. Spore-bearing processes globose, 
becoming divided into four parts, each division producing an elongated 
free point terminating in a simple spore. Fries. 

Distinguished by its peculiarly convoluted habit and jelly-like sub- 
stance, which is more or less inclined to be cartilaginous. 

Exidia, similar in form, is separated by possessing minute nipple-like 
elevations and Hirneola by its distinct difference in form. 

Generally growing on dead wood ; some species are found on trees 
and others on the ground, etc. 

Old tradition, in many countries, attests that the Tremellas are Fairy 
bread, and T. albida the choicest baking. Pretty, indeed, must have 
been the feasts when piles of such purity filled the board, and the bril- 
liant Pezizae were wassail cups. 

They are better suited to Fairy appetites than to those of mortals ; 
being watery their nutritive value is small. Nevertheless they have 
dainty flavor. 

So far as tested no suspicion rests upon Tremellae.

Spores subpyriform. 

On roots, dead branches, stumps, rails, etc. 

From July to December, 1898, tufts five inches in diameter grew 
from an oak stump close by the writer's cottage at Mt. Gretna, Pa. 
These tufts dried, and revived after rain into a gelatinous condition. 
They were nibbled at raw, and several were cooked. Tufts were found 
elsewhere in the same woods and eaten by others. They were unani- 
mously approved. The species dries hard, like thin glue, but is darker. 
A dried piece swells in the mouth, grows tough, and has but little taste. 
Flavor develops in cooking.

Richmond, Ind., November, 1898, sent me fine specimens. 

Very common as an apparent exudation from sticks, branches and 
rails. It can usually be collected in quantity from June until far into 
the winter. It can be found in every month in the year. 

During the civil war the writer's first attempt at making a dish of 
cornstarch resulted in getting it into knots. T. mesenterica, when stewed, 
very much resembles these same knots. It has a mild, woody flavor, 
slightly sweet, and is good.

I found T. mycetophila growing para- 
sitic upon Marasmius oreades, August, 
1894. The mass was 2 in. in diameter. 
Separating them was taking the host from

Where birch, sugar-maple, hickory are in abundance the T. albida 
will be found. At Eagle's Mere and Springton, Pa., and other wooded 
places, it is common during the warm months. It has slight taste, 
sweet, woody, but makes a pleasant dish.

Discomycetes 



SUB-CLASS ASCOMYCETES. 

The reproductive bodies consisting of sporidia mostly definite, con- 
tained in asci mother cells or sacs springing from a naked or enclosed 
stratum of fructifying cells and forming a hymenium or nucleus. The 
sporidia are often accompanied by simple or branched threads, which 
are abortive asci, called paraphyses. 

In Hymenomycetes the spores are entirely unenclosed and are borne 
on stalk-like processes on the gills of Agaricaceae, in the tubes of Poly- 
poraceae, on the spines of Hydnaceae, etc. In Ascomycetes they are 
enclosed in sacs springing from the external layer of the fruit-bearing 
surface, which may be on the outer surface of the plant or enclosed. 

COHORT DISCOMTCETES. Gr.-a. sac; Gr.-a fungus. 

The most important distinctive feature of Discomycetes consists in 
the disk or hymenium being fully exposed at maturity. It includes 
families which contain choice edible species. 

FAMILY. HELVELLA'CB^J. 

Fleshy, waxy or gelatinous; hymenium or sac-bearing surface ex- 
posed at first, or at length more or less exposed. Where a distinct 
stem is present it is surmounted by a more or less definite pileus or the 
stem is expanded into a club-like head. In Peziza the definite stem is 
absent and the plant is seated on the supporting surface. 

Many more genera than are noted below are included in Helvellaceae, 
but are not known to contain edible species.

Heiveiia. Stem of medium thickness. Pileus hanging loosely over the stem, 
more or less folded, but not into pits. Hymenium on the upper side 
only. 

Helvetia esculenta is now Gyromitra esculenta, and is in bad repute. 

Meanings of the unfamiliar words are too lengthy to give in the de- 
scriptions of species. They are in the Glossary. 

Dr. Badham says: "All Helvellae are esculent, have an agreeable 
odor, and bear a general resemblance in flavor to the Morell." 



H. cri'spa Fr. curled.

Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Distinguished from all other spe- 
cies by the stout, costate, lacunose, 
hollow stem; entirely glabrous, fra- 
gile and with a semi-transparent 
look. Color variable, included un- 
der the following forms : 

Var. al'ba. Pileus whitish.

Edible. Badham, Cordier, Cooke, Berkeley, Peck. 
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Mcllvaine. 
H. crispa is white and variable in shape of cap. In its color it differs 
from all others of its genus. It is found in the woods only, from July 
until frost. It is not usually abundant. It is an esculent species and 
good of its kind.

It presents characters essentially different from those of any species 
hitherto described. Its nearest ally is H. crispa, from which it differs 
in the color of the hymenium and stem and in being a larger species. 

H. lacuno'sa Afzel. uneven, pitted. Pileus inflated, lobed, cinere-

On shady ground. Otowanie woods, Lancaster county. 

The prominent character in this species, as indicated by the name, is 
the sulcate stem. The furrows are very deep, and extend, without 
interruption, the entire length of the stem. The whole stem, as shown 
by a cross-section, is made up of the costae intervening between these 
furrows. I do not find the stem "stuffed," as required by the descrip- 
tion in Syst. Myc., Vol. II, p. 15. The pileus is generally darker than 
that of H. crispa. Peck, 3ist Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

VER'PA Svvartz. 
Verpa, a rod. 

Ascophore stipitate, campanulate, ;ittached to the tip of the stem and Verpa. 
hanging down like a bell, surrounding but free from the side of the stem, 
regular, smooth or slightly wrinkled but not ribbed, persistent, thin, 
excipulum formed of interwoven, septate hyphae, hymenium entirely 
covering the outer surface of the ascophore; asci cylindrical, 8-spored. 
Spores elliptical, continuous, hyaline or nearly so, I -seriate; paraphyses 
septate. Stem elongated, stuffed. 

Very closely allied to Helvella ; distinguished by the ascophore be- 
ing more regular in form, and more evidently deflexed round the apex 
of the stem, which it surrounds like a thimble on a finger, and is quite 
free from the stem except at the apex. 

The species grow on the ground, in spring. Massee. 

V. digitalifor'mis Pers. digitus, a finger. Pileus at first nearly 
even, olivaceous-umber, dark at the apex. Stem obese, furnished at 
the base with a few reddish radicles, white with a slight rufous tinge, 
marked with transverse reddish spots; smooth to the naked eye, but un- 
der a lens clothed with fine adpressed flocci, the rupture of which gives 
rise to the spots, which are, in fact, minute scales. In the mature plant 
the pileus is % in. high, bell-shaped, finger-form, or subglobose, more 
or less closely pressed to the stem, but always free, the edge sometimes 
inflexed so as to form a white border, wrinkled, but not reticulated, un- 
der side slightly pubescent; sporidia yellowish, elliptic. Stem 3 in. 
high, }z in. or more thick, slightly attenuated downward,' loosely 
stuffed, by no means hollow. Berkeley.

Leotia. 




LEOTIA LUBRICA. 
Natural size. 



MOKCHEL'LA Dill. 
Gr. a mushroom. 

Stipitate or subsessile. Pileus globose or ovate, adnate throughout Morcheiia. 
its length to the sides of the stem, remaining closed at the apex, hollow 
and continuous with the cavity of the stem ; externally furnished with 
stout, branche'd and anastomosing ribs or plates, every part bearing the 
hymenium. Stem stout, stuffed or hollow; asci cylindrical, 2-4-8- 
spored. Spores i-seriate, continuous, hyaline, elliptical; paraphyses 
septate, clavate. 

Most nearly allied to Gyromitra ; differs in the ribs of the pileus be- 
ing deep and plate-like, and anastomosing to form elongated or irregu- 
larly polygonal deep pits. 

Growing on the ground in the spring. Massee. 

Stem stout; pileus ovoid or conical, deeply folded into pits, resem- 
bling honeycomb. 

Notwithstanding Dill, the author of the genus, describes the caps as 
adnate throughout their length to the stem, such is not the case. Pro- 

541 



Helvellaceae 

Morcheiia. fessor Peck arranges the genus into two groups, "in one of which the 
margin of the cap is wholly attached to the stem, in the other it is 
free." In the latter group are M. bispora and M. semilibera. 

The species are so much alike that botanical descriptions are omitted 
of all but M. esculenta and Professor Peck's species. 

Not one of the Morells is even suspicious. They are favorites wher- 
ever found. The Morell is one of the few species known to the settler 
and to the farmer. It loves old apple orchards, probably because ashes 
have been used about the trees ; ashes and cinders are its choice fertil- 
izers. In Germany peasants formerly burned forests to insure a bounti- 
ful crop. Mr. Moore, of San Francisco, Cal., says: "We find it in 
profusion on burnt hillsides all along the Pacific coast." 

But it does not confine its habitat to burned surfaces. It grows in 
thin open woods or on borders of woods. It grows under pine, ash, 
oaks and other trees. Strange to say it grows under the walnut tree 
where very few fungi of any kind grow. Especially does it love the 
white walnut or butternut. 

Morcheiia dry well and keep well for winter use. 

M. CSCulen'taPers. esculent. (Plate XLVI, fig. 2, p. 214.) Pileus 
globose, ovate or oblong, adnate to the stem at the base, hollow, ribs 
stout, forming irregular, polygonal, deep pits, pale dingy yellow, buff 
or tawny, 1.252.5 in. high and broad. Stem stout, whitish, almost 
even, hollow or stuffed, 1.25-2.5 in. high, .8 in. and more thick; asci 
cylindrical, 8-spored. Spores continuous, smooth, hyaline, elliptical, 
ends obtuse, 19-20x10/1, paraphyses rather slender, slightly thickened 
upward. 

On the ground. Spring and early summer. Edible. 

Variable in form, size and color, but distinguished by the pileus 
being adnate to the stem at the base, and the stout ribs anastomosing 
to form irregular, polygonal pits of about equal size, and not elongated. 
Mas see. 

Common over the states, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. 
In orchards, on ashes and cinders, under walnut, pine and oak trees. 
May and June. Mcllvaine. 

The common Morell varies in size, 24 in. high, sometimes larger. 
The cap, usually broader than it is long, oval, at times tapering to a 
rounded top. The cavities resemble those of a weather-beaten honey-

Total nitrogen, according to Lafayette B. Mendel, 4.66 per cent. 

M. cras'sipes Pers. crassus, thick; pes, a foot. Agreeing with M. 
esculenta in having the pits of the pileus irregular in form, not much, 
if at all, longer than broad, and in not having a main series of more or 
less parallel and vertical ribs ; differing in the stout stem being much 
longer than the pileus. Massee. 

Attains a height of 9 in. or more. 

Not rare in May. Kansas, Cragin; Minnesota, Johnson. 

Esculent. Cooke. 

M. delicio'sa Fr. The Delicious morell is easily known by the shape 
of its cap, which is cylindrical or nearly so. Sometimes it is slightly 
narrowed toward the top and occasionally curved, as in the preceding 
species, but its long narrow shape and blunt apex is quite strongly con- 
trasted with that species. It is usually two or three times as long as it 
is broad, and generally it is longer than the stem. Specimens also oc- 
cur in which the cap is slightly more narrow in the middle than it is 
above and below, and rarely it is slightly pointed at the apex. The 
pits on its surface are rather narrow and mostly longer than broad. The 
stem is often rather short. 

The plant varies from 1*2-3 in. high. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State 
Bot. 

Its name gives it esculent properties. 

M. COn'ica Pers. conical. The Conical morell has the cap conical 
or oblong-conical, as its name indicates. The longitudinal ridges on 
its surface run more regularly from top to base than in the Common 
morell. They are connected by short transverse ridges which are so 
distant from each other or so incomplete that the resulting pits or de- 
pressions are generally longer than broad, and sometimes rather irregu- 
lar. The color in the young plant is a beautiful buff-yellow or very- 
pale ochraceous, but it becomes darker with age. 

The plants are generally 3-5 in. high, with the cap i%2 in. thick 
in its broadest part, and distinctly broader than the stem. Peck, 48th 
Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

Helvellaceae 

Morcheiia. H. I. Miller, orchards, thin woods; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia, Mcllvaine. 

The conical form distinguishes M. conica from M. esculenta, if they 
are really different species, as some writers doubt. For the table there 
is not any difference. 

M. bi'spora Sor. Two-spored. The Two-spored morell is very simi- 
lar to the Half-free morell in external appearance. It is distinguishable 
by its cap, which is free from the stem almost or quite to the top. The 
stem of the European plant has been described as stuffed, but in our 
plant it is hollow, though possibly in very young plants it may be 
stuffed. The remarkable and very distinctive character which gives 
name to the species can only be seen by the aid of a microscope. In 
this species there are only two spores in each ascus or sack and these 
are much larger than the spores of the other species. They are two or 
three times longer and sometimes slightly curved. The spores of the 
other species are eight in an ascus and are very much alike in size and 
shape, and do not furnish decided specific characters ; but in this species 
their importance can not be overlooked. Their length is about 6o/*, 
while in the others it is 20-25/4. 

This is probably our rarest species. I am not aware that it has been 
found in but one locality in our state. A few years ago Mr. H. A. 
Warne detected it growing among fallen leaves in a ravine near Oneida. 
I have not tested its edible qualities, but would have no hesitation in 
eating it if opportunity should be afforded. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. 
State Bot. 

Var. trunca'ta. Pileus broadly rounded or truncate, its costae slightly 
prominent, the margin often a little recurved; paraphyses numerous. 
Stem long. 

Michigan. May. Hicks. Peck, 46th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

M. angus'ticeps Pk. angustus, narrow ; caput, head. Pileus oblong- 
conical and subobtuse or narrowly conical and acute, adnate to the stem, 
1-2 in. high, and about half as broad at the base, ribs longitudinal, 
here and there anastomosing or connected by transverse veins. Stem 
subequal, hollow, whitish, furfuraceous without and within, even or 
rarely rough with irregular longitudinal furrows ; asci cylindrical. Spores 
elliptical, whitish tinged with ocher, 2025x12.5-18/4; paraphyses 
short, clavate, with one or two septa near the base.

Helvellacese 



West Albany Moreheiia. 



Sandy soil in the borders of woods and in open places, 
and Center. April and May. 

Two forms occur, one with the pileus oblong-conical, rather obtuse, 
often tipped with a slight umbo or papilla, and with a diameter a little 
surpassing that of the stem from which the base is separated by a slight 
groove; the other with the pileus narrowly conical, rather acute, 
scarcely exceeding the stem in diameter and without any separating 
groove. The stem and fruit are alike in both forms. The stem is 
usually about equal in length to the pileus. The species is related to 
M. conica and M. elata, but may be separated from both by the size of 
the spores and the character of the paraphyses. In our plant I have 
never seen these as long as the asci. Large forms appear also to ap- 
proach M. rimosipes, but that species has the margin of the pileus more 
free, the stem proportionately longer, and the paraphyses as long as 
the asci, if we may rely upon the figure of it. Our plant is edible. 
Peck, 32d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

The plants are commonly 2-3 in. high, with the cap generally less 
than an inch broad in its widest part, but 

sometimes much larger specimens occur. (Plate CXLVIII.) 

Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 



M. semilib'era B.C. half-free. The Half- 
free morell has a conical cap, the lower half 
of which is free from the stem. It rarely ex- 
ceeds i in. or i % in. in length, and is usually 
much shorter than its stem. The pits on its 
surface are longer than broad. Deformed 
specimens occur in which the cap is hemi- 
spherical and very blunt or obtuse at the 
apex ; in others it is abruptly narrowed above 
and pointed. 

The plants are 2-4 in. high. The species is 
rare with us. Peck, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot. 

Spores pale-yellow. 

Odor feeble, becomes stronger in drying. 

Much less sapid than M. esculenta. Neither 

of these funguses should be gathered after 

rain, as they are then insipid and soon spoil.

MORCHELLA SEMILIBERA. 



Badham. 



Helvellaceae 



GYROMI'TKA Fr. 

Gyro, to turn; mitra, a head-covering. 

Gyromitra. Ascophore stipitate ; hymenophore subglobose, inflated and more or 
less hollow, or cavernous, variously gyrose and convolute at the surface, 
which is everywhere covered with the hymenium ; substance fleshy ; 
asci cylindrical, 8-spored. Spores uniseriate, elongated, hyaline or 
nearly so, continuous; paraphyses present. 

Helvetia of old authors. 

Distinguished from Morchella by the thick, brain-like folds of the 
hymenophore not anastomosing to form irregularly polygonal depres- 
sions ; and from Helvella in the hymenophore not being free from the 
stem at the base. 

Growing on the ground. Massee. 



(Plate CXLVIIIa.) 




G. esculen'ta Fr. (Plate VI, fig. 6, p. 6.) Pileus rounded, 
lobed, irregular, gyrose-convolute, glabrous, bay-red. 
gtem stout ^ stuffed or hollow, whitish, often irregular. 
Spores elliptical, binucleate, yellowish, 20-22/x long. 
The Edible gyromitra, formerly known as Helvella 
esculenta, is easily recognized by its chestnut-red 
irregularly rounded and lobed cap with its brain-like 
convolutions. The margin of the cap is attached to 
the stem in two or three places. When cut through 
it is found to be hollow, whitish within and uneven, 
with a few prominent irregular ribs or ridges. The 
stem is whitish, slightly scurfy, and when mature, hol- 
low. In large specimens it sometimes appears as if 
formed by the union of two or more smaller ones. 
The plant is 24 in. high and the cap commonly 23 in. broad. 
Specimens sometimes occur weighing a pound each. It is fond of sandy 
soil and is found in May and June. It grows chiefly in wet weather or 
in wet ravines or springy places in the vicinity of pine groves or pine 
trees. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

SECTION OF GYRO- 
MITRA ESCULENTA. 



Helvellaceee 

Since 1882 myself and friends have repeatedly eaten it. In no instance Gyromitra. 
was the slightest discomfort felt from it. It was always enjoyed. Mr. 
Charles H. Allen, San Jose, Cal., writes to me that G. esculenta grows 
plentifully in his region, and that it is not only edible, but he has found 
it one of the best. But the species, though long ago esteemed highly 
in Europe and by many in America, now rests under decided suspicion. 
It is not probable that in our great food-giving country anyone will be 
narrowed to G. esculenta for a meal. Until such an emergency arrives, 
the species would be better let alone. If utilized employ only perfectly 
fresh and sound specimens. 

G. cur'tipes Fr. curtus, short; pes, afoot. Pileus inflated, gyrosely 
undulated, oblong, rotund, at first pallid then brownish; margin of 
pileus closely adnexed to the stem. Stem irregular, short or almost 
absent. Asci cylindrical. Spoi'idia .30x9^1 fusiform, uninucleate. 
Paraphyses clavate. 

On the ground. Spring. Readily distinguished from other species 
by the almost obliterated stem. Fries commends it highly as an 
esculent. 

Separated from G. esculenta by paler color, shorter stem and differ- 
ent spores. 

G. Carolillia'na (Bosc.) Fr. Pileus rotund, base free, surface 
woven into deep irregular undulating folds. Stem conical, sulcate. 
Asci cylindrical. Sporidia 3-3. 2x I/A; somewhat fusiform; paraphyses 
thickened toward the top.

the leaves among which it grows, whitish underneath; asci 8-spored. 
Spores oval, 28-307*. long, by about 14^ wide, hyaline, somewhat 
roughened-tuberculate, usually nucleate, the highly refractive nucleus 
spherical or oval, II/A or, if oval, 14x11;* in diameter; paraphyses 
slender, enlarged at the apex, faintly septate. 

In rich woods, mostly in beech-leaf mold. Putnam county, Ind., 
May, 1892, 1893 an< 3 1894. First found by Dr. W. V. Brown. 

The plant is esculent, tender and possesses a fine flavor. Often as 
many as 8 or 10 plants would be found in one small area, but the plant 
appears to be local and never very abundant. Some single plants would 
weigh nearly half a pound. 



Mitrula. 



MI'TRULA Fr. 
(Emended, Massee.) 

Ascophore stipitate, fleshy. Head subglobose, ovate, or clavate, 

even, glabrous, everywhere covered with the 
(Plate CL.) hymenium, adnate throughout to the more or 

less elongated stem ; asci cylindric-clavate, 
8-spored. Spores narrowly elliptic-fusiform, 
hyaline, continuous or septate, irregularly 
I 2-seriate; paraphyses present. Fries. 

M. vitelli'na Sacc., var. irregularis Pk. 
vitellus, egg-yolk. Pileus clavate, often 
irregular or compressed and somewhat lobed, 
obtuse, glabrous, yellow, tapering below into 
the short, rather distinct, yellowish or whitish 
stem. Spores narrowly elliptical, 8-iOju, long. 

When the Irregular mitrula is well grown 
and symmetrical it closely resembles the 
typical European plant, but usually the clubs 
or caps are curved, twisted, compressed or 
lobed in such a way that it is difficult to find 
two plants just alike. The plants are usually 
only one or two inches high, so that they 

would scarcely be thought of any importance as an edible species. But

sometimes it grows in considerable profusion in wet mossy places in Mitmia. 
woods, so that it would not be difficult to gather a pint of them in a 
short time. Its beautiful bright yellow color makes it a very attractive 
object. It is our largest species of Mitrula and occurs in autumn. 

It was first reported as an edible species in the forty-second report. 
Its flesh is tender and its flavor delicate and agreeable. Peck, 48th Rep. 

Ontario, Dearness (LI. R. 4). West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsyl- 
vania. Common, gregarious in moist woods. September to Novem- 
ber. Mcllvaine. 

Those fortunate enough to find this species will hunt for it again 
assiduously. Even raw, when cut in strips, it makes a picturesque and 
delicious salad. 



SPATHULA'RIA Pers. 
A spatula. 

Receptacle erect, spathulate, compressed, hollow, adnate to the stem, Spathniana. 
down which it runs for some distance on opposite sides, everywhere 
covered with the hymenium. Stem subcylindrical, hollow; asci clavate, 
apex narrowed, 8-spored. Spores elongated, cylindric-clavate, multi- 
septate at maturity, arranged in a parallel fascicle in the ascus; para- 
physes filiform, septate. 

Distinguished by the broad, flattened ascophore running down oppo- 
site sides of the stem. 

Growing on pine leaves or on the ground among moss. Massee. 

Resembling a spatha, an instrument for stirring a liquid, shaped like

Professor Peck gives S. rugosa, which has the club wrinkled. 

This odd, pretty little plant was found by me in great numbers at 
Eagle's Mere, Pa., August, 1897, growing among mosses. The con- 
trast of its bright yellow paddle-shapes against the moss-green is very 
pleasing to one who loves choice bits of color. Its consistency when 
stewed is tenacious but tender, and its flavor is delicate. 



Geoglossnm. (Plate CLI.) 




GEOGLOS'SUM Pers. 
(Emended.) 

Entire fungus more or less clavate, erect, the apical, 
thickened portion everywhere covered with the hymen- 
ium ; glabrous or hairy, often viscid; asci clavate, 
apex narrowed, 8-spored. Spores elongated, ar- 
ranged in a parallel fascicle, cylindrical or very slightly 
thickened above the middle, and inclined to become 
cylindric-clavate, brown, septate, usually slightly 
curved; paraphyses septate, brown at the tips, often 
longer than the asci. 

Distinguished among the clavate species by the long, 
narrow, brown, septate spores. The entire plant is 
black in all British species. 

Growing on the ground, among grass, etc. Massee.

The genus is large. Professor Peck reports 150 American species. 
Some are large, others require the microscope to find them. 

They are rather indiscriminate in their habitats; some are eccentric; 
these grow on damp walls, on dung, in cellars and cisterns, on spent 
hops and on old fungi. One or two species grow on sticks under water, 
an unusual place for fungi of any kind. Minute species grow upon 
stems of herbaceous plants; nine or ten upon the nettle. Two species 
contain a milky fluid, P. succosa and P. saniosa. Many are known in 
Europe which have not been found in America. European authors 
differ as to their qualities; some call them insipid, some speak of them 
with kindly respect. Much depends upon their cooking. They are, 
as a rule, tenacious in texture. To cook them properly requires time 
and slow stewing. They then become soft and rather glutinous. Their 
flavor is slight but pleasant, and their consistency agreeable.

P. badia is frequent on bare ground, along wood roads, etc. In the 
West Virginia mountains it occurs where there have been brush fires. 
It is a meaty plant, without much flavor. It must be cut fine and slowly 
cooked if stewed, or can be quickly fried in a hot buttered pan. It has 
more flavor fried crisp than stewed. 

P. COChlea'ta spiral. Sessile, cespitose, variously contorted and 
plicate, fleshy, brittle, disk umber-brown, externally paler and pruinose, 
sometimes altogether paler and leather-color or pale dingy-ochraceous, 
23.2 in. diameter; when solitary or almost so, at first globose, then 
expanding with the margin involute, finally spreading and irregularly 
plicate; excipulum spongy and cavernous, due to the loose weft formed 
by interlacing, hyaline, thin-walled, flaccid, septate hyphae, cortex com- 
pact, running out into irregular groups of cells that form the scurfy ex-

The plant when fresh has the peculiar fungoid flavor suggestive of 
that of chestnut blossoms. The species is apparently allied to P. 
Petersii, from which it may be distinguished by its larger spores and 
distinct but peculiar odor. The spores also are not binucleate, as in 
that species. In drying, the hymenium is apt to become blackish. Peck, 
Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 23, No. 10. 

A cluster 4 inches across, in general appearance resembling P. re- 
panda, was found by the writer at Mt. Gretna, Pa., June, 1898, grow- 
ing from between the staves of an empty flour barrel which was exposed 
to the weather. The margin instead of being revolute, turned inward 
(involute) until it touched the short stem. The cluster was eaten and 
had the flavor of P. repanda. In June, 1899, several pounds grew on 
and around the same barrel. Professor Peck recognized it as P. odorata.

near Scarboro, England, and is regularly collected and sold along with

Hypocreaceae 



COHORT PTRENOMTCETES. 
FAMILY. HYP OGRE AC E-ffi. 

HYPO'MYCES Fr. 

Gr. under; Gr. fungus. 

Perithecia (the hollow narrow-mouthed cases which contain the Hypomyce*. 
spores) gregarious, with a cottony stroma in which they are more or 
less immersed. Mostly parasitic on various Hymenomycetes or Dis- 
comycetes; bright colored, with papilliform (nipple-shaped) or slightly 
elongated ostiola (apertures). Asci mostly cylindrical, 8-spored, with- 
out paraphyses. Sporidia oblong or fusoid, uniseptate, hyaline. Co- 
nidial stage represented by Asterophora, etc. 

This parasite attacks several species of fungi, and so alters their 
structure and appearance that it is difficult to distinguish the host-plant. 
The attack is made in the extreme youth of the plant. The writer is 
fully satisfied from his own observation that H. lactifluorum and H. 
purpurea infest Lactarius piperatus. The milk cells are so changed by 
H. lactifluorum that they yield no milk. When attacked by H. pur- 
purea the milk is a beautiful purple. In both cases the pepperiness of 
the host-plant is destroyed. I have seen the same host plant attacked 
by both forms of the Hypomyces. After the host-plant of Hypomyces 
lactifluorum is fully grown, and infested, it is frequently attacked by 
Hypomyces purpureus. Purple spots appear, which gradually spread 
until the entire plant is covered. This Hypomyces seems to affect the 
milk cells. A beautiful, profuse, purple fluid results. 

The parasite is proving itself an enemy to fungi, but a friend to man. 
Upon L. piperatus and upon Amanita rubescens it very much adds to 
the weight of the plants, and improves the texture and edible qualities. 
The same may be said of L. volemus, but not to such a degree. Prof. 
M. W. Easton in August, 1899, found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa., 
attacked by a parasitic fungus in such a manner as to destroy its milk- 
36 561 



Hypocreacese 

Hypomyces. giving quality and completely transform its gills into a corrugated, 
granular surface. 

Professor Peck, to whom I submitted the parasite, thinks it a new 
species and calls it H. volemi. 

Further study of Hypomyces and its effect upon fungi, and of the 
particular host-plants is desirable. 

H. lac'tifluorum (Schw.) Tulasne lac, milk; fluerum, flowing. 
(Plate CXXXVI, fig. 5, p. 508.) Asci long and slender, sporidia in 
one row, spindle-shaped, straight or slightly curved, rough, hyaline, 
uniseptate, cuspidate-pointed at the ends, 3038x6-8^. 

The general appearance is much the same as that of H. aurantius 
(Pers. ) Tul., but the sporidia are larger, rough and warted, and the 
felt-like mycelium is wanting. 

In the affected species of Lactarius the gills are entirely obliterated, 
so that the hymenium of the agaric presents an even, orange-colored 
surface on which the subglobose perithecia are thickly bedded, with 
only their slightly prominent reddish ostiola visible. In decay the color 
changes to a purplish-red.

This fungus puzzled me for many years. August, 1896, I sent sev- 
eral specimens to Professor Peck of different colors orange, red, whitish 
and purple. 

Professor Peck kindly identified the specimens and wrote : "In one 
the matrix of the host-plant has not been so completely changed or 
transformed as in the other. It would be interesting to know what 
species of Lactarius it is that Hypomyces attacks. I have never been 
able to ascertain, and have sometimes thought it might be Cantharellus 
cibarius, but this specimen of yours indicates, rather, a Lactarius." 

Of the purple specimen he wrote: " This is a beautiful thing, and 
as I find nothing like it described I have given it a name Hypomyces 
purpureus Peck." 

Well cooked, in small pieces, it is one of the very best.

Pennsylvania. August. Charles Mcllvaine. 

The species is similar in all respects to H. lactifluorum, except in 
color. It is apparently parasitic on some species of Lactarius, but the 
host plant is so transformed and discolored that the species is not 
recognizable. Peek, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 25, No. 6. 

H. purpureus Pk. was sent by the writer to Professor Peck in Au- 
gust, 1897, who wrote: "This is a beautiful thing and as I find noth- 
ing like it described, I have given it a name." 

Of itself H. purpureus is a minute parasitic fungus as above described. 
But it possesses the power of so altering the structure changing form, 
shape and appearance of the fungus upon which it has taken its abode 
that the host-plant, be it Cantharellus cibarius, Craterellus cantharellus 
or one of the Lactari, or whatever the species, becomes difficult to rec- 
ognize, so that it is not yet certain upon which species it is parasitic. 
It may be upon many. 

The present plant seems to be parasitic upon one of the Lactarii. It 
therefore becomes necessary to describe the host as it appears when 
possessed by the parasite. The plant is variable in shape from an ir- 
regular nodule to a distorted-capped, short-stemmed mass, 2-4 in. 
across, 13 in. high, hard, brittle, coarse in appearance and rough to 
the touch ; deep orange, wholly or in part stained with a beautiful pur- 
ple. The purple juice exudes and dyes everything with which it comes 
in contact. The growth is very heavy for its size. 

To all appearances it is the same host as is attacked by Hypomyces 
lactifluorum, resembling it in every particular excepting in the purple 
stain and juice. 

It is frequent in open oak and chestnut woods, but prefers oak. It 
grows from among leaves or from grassy spots. August to October. 

While it is beautiful in its coloring it is not inviting in appearance as 
an edible. Yet sliced, cut small and stewed for twenty minutes it is one 
of the very best fungi I have eaten.

FAMILY. TUBERA'CE-ffi. 

Subterranean; ascophore irregularly globose, usually large, not rup- Tuber, 
turing. 

To this family belongs the Truffle 

of commerce renowned for its fla- (Plate CLIII.) 

voring qualities. It has not yet 
been found in America, though 
several fungi are ignorantly bought 
in our markets under that name ; 
notably Coprinus comatus or maned 
mushroom. The writer has fre- 
quently been informed with all the 
logical force of genuine market- 
women that this was the real Truffle, 
because they raised it themselves. 

Until quite recently but one 
species of Truffle has been reported 

as growing in America. This, Tuber niveum Desf. or Terfezia leonis 
Tul. was found by Rev. A. B. Langlois, St. Martinville, La. He re- 
ported it as growing plentifully, buried or nearly so in the red sand land 
along the Red river near Natchitoches. He writes me: "The people 
where it is found are looking for it with great care and are eating it with 
great relish. I had occasion to eat it once and I found it delicious." 
He kindly sent the original illustration from which the accompanying 
drawing was made. It was taken from Jour. Myc., January, 1887, J. 
B. Ellis, who first published a description of the American representa- 
tive of the species. He describes it as "subglobose, up to full two 
inches in diameter, strongly plicate or furrowed below, nearly smooth 
and pale reddish-brown outside, marbled-white within and of compact 
texture much like a potato, but softer. When first dug from the ground 
the color is pure white, the reddish tint being due to exposure to the 
air. The asci obovate or subglobose, 75 80x60 /O/A. Each contains 
eight globose spores, thickly clothed with obtuse, elongated, wart-like 
tubercles and about 2Op in diameter. The home of the white Truffle is

Tuberaceae 



Tuber, said to be in Northern Africa, though it is not uncommon in Southern 
Europe, where its growth is favored by mild winters." 

It is probable that the Truffle will be found in other southern states. 
Perhaps in the north, as Fries reports that two specimens were found 
near Linkoping, Sweden, and Mr. H. W. Harkness reports Tubers in the. 
Sierras at the height of 7,000 feet. It is worth hunting for. 

It is possible that the common Truffle Tuber aestivum will be found 
in America. Fame awaits the finder. A description of it with illustra- 
tion is therefore given.

Peridium warty, of a blackish-brown color, 
the warts polygonal and striate; 
flesh transversed by numerous veins ; 
asci 4-6-spored ; spores elliptical, 
reticulated. 

This plant, the common Truffle of 
our markets, is abundant in Wilt- 
shire and some other parts of Eng- 
land, and probably occurs in many 
places where it escapes observation 
from its subterranean habit. Bad- 
ham. 

It is cultivated largely in France. 
"Perigord Truffles" are a costly 

delicacy. The Truffle is of subterranean habit, growing under various 
kinds of trees and from 1248 in. under ground. As it does not mani- 
fest its presence above ground, dogs and pigs are trained to find it by 
scent. An interesting chapter on Truffles will be found in British 
Edible Fungi, M. C. Cooke, 1891. Any plant of similar habit, when 
found, should be immediately sent by the finder to a known expert for 
identification. 

Thirteen species of Tuber and several Terfeziaa are reported in Cali- 
fornia, and are described and beautifully illustrated in "California 
Hypogaeous Fungi" by H. W. Harkness, "Proceedings of the Cali- 
fornia Academy of Sciences," 1899. 

Terfezia spinosa Harkness closely resembles T. leonis Tul., and T. 
(sphaerotuber) Californicum n. sp., found under oaks beneath vegetable 
humus in Alameda county, Cal., Professor Harkness remarks, is nearly

identical with an edible species found in Italy. All species found in Tuber. 
California are said to be edible, but to be too rare to be of food value. 

There is a well known growth, found from New Jersey south to the 
Gulf and west to Kansas, called Tucka- 
hoe (Pachyma cocos) . (Plate CLV), 
an Indian name meaning a round loaf or 
cake, and famed for its edible qualities. 
Its exact place in plant growth has been 
variously determined. It is now con- 
ceded that it is the sclerotium or cellular 
reservoir of reserve material of some 
fungus. It is usually found attached to 
the roots of trees, in low marshy places. 
It grows several feet below the surface, 
and to the size of a man's head. It 
varies in shape, being oblong or round, 
having a coarse brown covering, looking 
like a cocoanut. Its interior is white, 
compact, without cellular structure; it 
has no mycelium or trace of fructifica- 
tion. It contains, as high as 77 per cent, of pectose and is therefore 
highly nutritious.

As has been stated, the two Cohorts in which a hymenium or spore- 
bearing surface is present are called Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes. 
In the first the hymenium is exposed, as in the common mushroom. In 
the second Gastromycetes the hymenium is at first enclosed in a sac 
or peridium, as in the common puff-ball. 

The botanical description of Gastromycetes, given by M. C. Cooke, 
is: "Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in 
most cases of closely-packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked 
spores on distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the 
insisting coat or peridium.' 

The Gastromycetes are usually large, ground-growing fungi. A few 
grow upon wood. The peridium is of dense structure, usually globose 

568 



Phalloideae 

and of considerable thickness. It commonly consists of two layers. 
These form the sac holding the spore-bearing structure, which is called 
the gleba. The gleba consists of innumerable chambers or cells, 
curved and branched, and only to be distinguished by magnifying. 
The primary structure is retained in some species throughout the life of 
the plants, excepting changes due to growth and maturing, or in others 
these cells or chambers are large and few, and form distinct peridiola, 
which contain the spores. 

The maturing of the plant and the consequent changes in the gleba 
is accompanied by various transformations of the peridium." 

It is impossible within the scope of this book to even name all the 
genera of Gastromycetes. Professor Morgan's table of the families and 
table of the genera of Lycoperdaceae are here given. The orders are 
defined as are some of the genera, and the edible species are described.

Plant 6-8 in. high. Volva 2> in. in diameter. Stipe i% in. PhaUus. 
thick in the middle. Pileus 2 in. in height. The long veil usually 
clings close to the stipe though sometimes swinging free and much ex- 
panded. In this species the gleba extends over the apex and there is 
no thick smooth ring encircling the perforation as in the preceding 
species (P. Daemonum). Morgan. 

Growing in woods about old stumps and rotten logs. West Virginia, 
in woods, along mountain trails; Mt. Gretna, Pa., in mixed woods, 
summer. Mcllvaine. 

In the forests of the West Virginia mountains, P. duplicatus is fre- 
quent. Before rupture of the volva the plant is a semi-gelatinous mass, 
tenacious and elastic. It has little taste or smell. Cut in slices and 
fried, or stewed, it is a tender, agreeable food. 

b. Veil not reticulate, concealed beneath the pileus. 

P. Ravenel'ii B. and C. Volva subglobose or ovoid, pinkish ; with an 
inner membrane, the lower half of the veil surrounding the base of the 
stem; segments 2 or 3. Stem cylindric, tapering at each end, cellu- 
lose; the veil membranous, scarcely half as long as the pileus and con- 
cealed beneath it. Pileus conico-bell-shaped ; the surface not reticu- 
late-pitted after deliquescence ; the apex smooth and closed or finally 
perforate. Spores elliptic-oblong, 4x52^. 

Plant 5-7 in. high. Volva i>2-2 in. in diameter. Stem nearly i in. 
thick. Pileus i / in. in height. This species vitiates the genus Dic- 
tyophora and it can not very well be placed in Ithyphallus.

By the elongation of the stem the thin membrane which separates the 
stipe from the pileus is torn into shreds and the pileus is thus liberated 
from the stipe except at the apex. Morgan. 

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Summer and autumn. 
Mel 'lvalue. 

P. impudicus makes itself known wherever it grows. The stench of 
the full-grown plant is aggravatingly offensive, attracting blow-flies in 
quantities, and the carrion beetle Necrophorus Americanus. It is 
common over the United States, in woods, open fence corners, along 
road-sides, but a favorite abode is in kitchen yards and under wooden 
steps, where, when mature, it will compel the household to seek it in 
self-defense. It is a beautiful plant. 

When in the egg-shape it is white or light dull-green, semi-gelatinous, 
tenacious and elastic. As many as a dozen sometimes grow in a bunch, 
each from a peculiar white, cord-like root or mycelium. They look, 
when young, like bubbles of some thick substance. In this condition 
they are very good when fried. They demand to be eaten at this time, 
if at any.

of the forest carpet. The plant has 
not .the mal-odor of its relations, 
but is not pleasant. In the egg 
shape it is gelatinous, tenacious, 
rather firm, edible and good when 
sliced and fried.

This order contains many of our most delicious and important food 
species. The characteristics of all genera are given. In several of them 
no species are reported edible, but it is more than probable that all are.

Geaster. short pedicel, dehiscent at the apex by a single mouth. Capillitium tak- 
ing its origin from the inner surface 
of the peridium and also from a dis- 
tinct central columella, which arises 
from its base; threads simple, long, 
slender, thickest in the middle and 
tapering to each extremity, fixed at 
one end and free at the other. Spores 
small, globose, minutely warted, 
brown. Morgan. 

G. minimus, when found by the 
writer, was not tested because not 
found in condition. It is a plant 
beautiful in its oddity. Its seven to 
nine outer segments of skin loosen 
at the bottom, spring up, raising 
the oval body of the plant with 
them, turn their points down and 
balance on the lower points, and look, 
in miniature, just as would two sec- 
tional orange peels spread at their 
loose points if one was rested, point 

to point, upon the other. This hoisting of the spore-bearing part aloft, 
that it may better eject its spores to the wind, does not seem to have 
been noted by Professor Morgan. Specimens sent to Professor Peck 
by the writer beautifully illustrated this enterprise of the plant. 

G. hygrome'tricus Pers. (Plate CLX, 2 figs., p. 580.) Peridium 
depressed-globose, the cuticle deciduous with the mycelium; outer 
peridium deeply parted, the segments 7-20, strongly hygrometric, 
acute at the apex; inner peridium depressed-globose, sessile, reticulate, 
pitted, whitish becoming gray or brownish; the mouth an irregularly 
lacerate aperture. Threads of the capillitium rather thinner than the 
spores, hyaline. Spores globose, minutely warted, brown, 8-1 I/A in. 
in diameter. 

Growing in fields and woods in sandy soil. A very common species 
found everywhere in the world. Inner peridium % i in. in diameter, 
the segments expanding to a breadth of 23 in. The inner layer of the

outer peridium is cartilaginous-gelatinous, hard and rigid when dry, Geaster. 
swelling greatly and flexible when wet ; though constantly becoming 
more and more cracked and fissured, it retains its hygroscopic qualities 
a long time, and the outer peridium remains lying on the soil, stellate 
in shape, spreading out its rays in moist weather and bending them 
inward in dry. Morgan. 

Mr. Morgan made a new genus Astraeus, in which he placed this 
species. It is so widely known as Geaster hygrometricus that to avoid 
confusion it is placed in its old genus. 

This natural barometer, spreading its stellate covering on the soil 
about it when the air is laden with moisture, and closing it around 
its puffy body when humidity is absent, is odd and interesting. The 
entire genus is more or less gifted with this weather-wise quality. The 
species is very common, but seldom found in number. Once, in the 
West Virginia mountains, 1882, I found a large patch of it, and was 
able to collect from it enough young ones to test its edibility. It is 
difficult to find before it bursts its outer coat. When young it is, 
when cooked, soft and creamy inside. The outer part is tough and 
semi-glutinous but of pleasant texture. It has not a marked flavor, but 
makes a succulent dish.

Peridium large, globose and nearly sessile, or turbinate with a well-de- 
veloped base ; cortex a very thin adherent layer, often smooth and con- 
tinuous, sometimes composed of minute spinules or granules; inner 
peridium a loosely woven and very fragile covering, after maturity 
breaking up into fragments from above downward and gradually falling 
away. Subgleba cellulose, mostly definitely limited and concave above, 
persistent; mass of spores and capillitium dense, compact, persistent a 
long time and slowly dissipating after the fracture of the peridium ; the

Lycoperdacess 

C. gigantea Batsch. gigantic. (Z. bovista Linn. ; L. maximum Caivatia. 
Schaeff. ; L. giganteum Batsch.) Very large, 10-20 in. in diameter, 
obconic or depressed-globose, nearly or quite sessile, white or whitish, 
becoming discolored by age, smooth or slightly roughened by weak 
spinose or minute floccose warts, sometimes cracking in areas; capilli- 
tium and spores yellowish-green to dingy-olive. Spores smooth, 41*. in. 
in diameter. Edible. Peck, 32d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

Spores globose, even or sometimes minutely warted, 3.54-5 m - in 
diameter, often with a minute pedicel. Morgan. 

Common over the states. Growing on the ground in grassy places 
in fields and woods. August to October. 

tv As the name implies, this species is gigantic. It is the largest of all 
fungi. It has attained the diameter of three feet in this country, but is- 
reported larger in Europe. I have found it in West Virginia weighing 
nine pounds, but one is reported as found in Gordon Park weighing 
fdrty-seven pounds. I have often followed the advice of Vittadini and 
sliced a meal for my family from growing individuals. The cut surface 
contracts and dries!' The plant seems to be deprived of its power to 
further ripen. It can thus be cut for many days. It has other than 
food uses in its dry form as a sponge, as tinder, as a color, as a styptic 
in hemorrhage ; the Finns make a remedy of it for diarrhea in calves, 
and it is burned under bee-hives to stupefy bees. 

It, as well as L. cyathiforme, is an admirable and delicate fungus. 

C. pachyder'ma Pk. Gr. thick-skinned. Peridium very large, 
globose or obovoid, often irregular, with a thick cord-like root; cortex 
thin, smooth, whitish, persistent, drying up into polygonal areolae 
which are white in the center with a brown border ; inner peridium very 
thick but fragile, with a separable membranaceous lining, after maturity 
gradually breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba ob- 
solete ; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow then olive-brown ; 
the threads very long, occasionally septate, branched, mostly thinner 
than the spores. Spores globose, distinctly warted, 5-6ft in diameter, 
sometimes with a minute pedicel. 

Growing on the ground. Arizona, Pringle; Dakota, Miss Nellie 
Crouch. Peridium 4-8 in. in diameter. Remarkable for its thick 
peridium, which becomes white spotted and areolate. Morgan. 

I have not seen this species.

ited and concave above, persistent. 

C. cyathifor'mis Bosc. cup-shaped. (L. cyatki forme Bosc.) (Plate 
CLXII, p. 584.) Peridium 3-6 in. in diameter, globose or depressed- 
globose, smooth or minutely floccose or scaly, whitish cinereous brown 
or pinkish brown, often cracking into areas in the upper part, commonly 
with a short, thick, stem-like base; capillitium and spores purple-brown, 
these and the upper part of the peridium falling away and disappearing 
when old, leaving a cup-shaped base with a ragged margin. Spores 
globose, rough, purple-brown, 5-6. 5/x. broad. Peck, 48th Rep. N. Y. 
.State Bot. 

Common over United States. Indiana, H . I. Miller ; West Virginia, 
New Jersey. On open grassy ground. July to October. Mcllvaine. 

Often a queer, ragged, cup-shaped, purplish mass is noticed protrud- 
ing from the ground, looking as if the upper half had been cut off hori- 
zontally. This is the mature C. cyathiformis, or rather, what is left of 
it. The upper half has blown away and is spreading its spores else- 
where. 

A first-class Lycoperdon, meaty and of excellent flavor. When it 
occurs, it is usually in plenty. On the great parade ground at Mt. 
Gretna, Pa., it annually appears in large quantities. Cows are fond'of 
it, and it is this fungus which is currently believed among farmers to 
affect milk. I have watched cows pawing it to pieces and eating por- 
tions of it. 

C. fra'gilis Vitt. fragile. Peridium obovoid, plicate below, with a 
short-pointed base and a cord-like root. Cortex a smooth continuous 
layer, very thin and fragile, separable, white or grayish, becoming 
brownish and tinged with violet and purple, commonly areolate above; 
inner peridium thin, violet to purple, velvety, extremely fragile, after 
maturity the upper part soon breaking up into fragments and falling 
away. Subgleba occupying but a small portion of the peridium, cup- 
shaped above, persistent; mass of spores and capillitium from violet to 
pale purple; the threads very long, mostly thinner than the spores, 
scarcely branched. Spores globose, minutely warted, 4-5.5/1 in diame- 
ter, sessile.

growing in great patches of numerous individuals. I do not know that 
the edible qualities of this species have been tested. Morgan. 

Chester county, Pa. Springton Hills. On ground in mixed woods. 
August to October. Mcllvaine. 

Not a frequent species with us. I have seen it only in the locality 
named. The substance is very like that of L. pyriforme. When white 
it has a strong but pleasant odor, and in this condition it is an excellent 
fungus. The slightest change to yellow makes it bitter. 

C. rubl'O-fla'va Cragin reddish-yellow. Peridium obconic, taper- 
ing gradually downward to the rooting mycelium. Cortex a very thin 
furfuraceous or granulose coat, with a few short, scattered spinules 
above; inner peridium thin and fragile, at first whitish, soon becoming 
orange-red to orange-brown in color, after maturity the upper part 
breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba occupying 
about a third part of the peridium ; mass of spores and capillitium red- 
dish-ocher then olivaceous-orange ; the threads very long, rather thicker 
than the spores, branched. Spores globose, even, 3-3.5^ in diameter, 
sometimes with a minute pedicel. 

Growing on the ground. Kansas, Cragin, Kellerman. Peridium

CALVATIA ELATA. 
(After Morgan.) 



Lycoperdaceee 

GENUS IX. LYCOPER'DON Tourn. 

Mycelium fibrous, rooting from the base. Peridilim small, globose, Lycoperdon, 
obovoid or turbinate, with a more or less thickened base; cortex a sub- 
persistent coat of soft spines, scales, warts or granules; inner peridium 
thin, membranaceous becoming papyraceous, dehiscent by a regular 
apical mouth. Morgan. 

When the plant sits (without stem) directly upon the ground or 
wood it is sessile. The outer layer of the two parts of its covering is 
the exterior peridium (sometimes spoken of as cortex} . This frequently 
breaks up into scales, spines, bristles, minute flocculent or powdery 
masses, and these vary in size and in many species disappear as the 
plant matures. These are of determining value in several species of 
Lycoperdaceae. Plants with coarse, long spines are echinate because 
they bristle. When the spines incline together and form a point they 
are stellate. Various formations of this outside covering are also called 
warts. The inner rind or skin is the true peridium. 

The mass of thread-like filaments which fills the interior of the plant 
is called the capillitium. The filaments are deftly interlaced. At times 
filaments springing from the base do not interlace with the others ; these 
are called columellce. These filaments bear the spores the dust which 
puffs out in such quantity and gives the common name to the plant 
puff-ball and its Mephistophelian one The Devil's Snuff-box. In 
some species the filaments at the base of the plant are sterile they do 
not bear spores. These filaments are more contracted and form the 
neck, stem or subgleba. The gleba is the upper interior of the plant, 
in which the spores are contained. See plate CLVI. 

Dehiscent is said of an organ which opens of itself at maturity. A 
plant is dehiscent at the discharging point of its spores. If this is at 
the summit it is apically dehiscent. 

The descriptions herein given of American representatives of European 
species are in many instances those of A. P. Morgan, who has made 
special study of this genus, and those of Professor C. H. Peck, whose 
interstate experience acquaints him with every varying form. Mr. Mor- 
gan has kindly given permission to use his text and drawings. 

No one has yet had reason to doubt the harmlessness of any puff- 
ball. There are a few I have not eaten, but believing that these will be 
proven edible, descriptions of all species occurring in America are given.

Gastromycetes 

Lycoperdon. There are first and second-class puff-balls. Usually the small species 
are slightly strong, and if a shade of yellow appears upon breaking any 
puff-ball, it will be more or less bitter and will spoil a whole dish. The 
larger species are milder. The flavor of purf-balls appears to be issued 
to them as a ration. It is all there in a little fellow, and in a big one it 
is simply spread through more substance.

2, p. 568.) Peridium % 1) in. broad, subglobose, generally nar- 
rowed below into a short stem-like base, whitish brownish or pinkish- 
brown, echinate above with rather stout spines, which at length fall off

Ground and decaying wood in woods. Albany, Forestburg and 
Adirondack mountains. August to October. 

The whole plant is generally obovate, pyriform or turbinate, and the 
spines are larger and more or less curved at and near the apex, dimin- 
ishing in size toward the base where they are more persistent. In the 
immature condition it is difficult to distinguish it from L. pediceltetum ; 
but when mature its smooth peridium and spores destitute of pedicels 
separate it. Peck, 32d Rep. N. Y. State Bot. 

L. echinatum appears to be common to all the states. August to 
frost. It is frequent but not abundant. Raw the taste is slight. Cooked 
it is tender and of good flavor.

obovoid, sometimes subturbinate, with a short stout base; the mycelium 
forming a thick cord-like root. Cortex consisting of very long white 
spines, converging and often coherent at the apex; the spines at length 
fall away from the upper part of the peridium, leaving the inner perid- 
ium with a smooth purplish-brown shining surface, sometimes faintly 
reticulated. Subgleba occupying about a third part of the peridium; 
mass of spores and capillitium at first olivaceous, then brownish-purple;

and convergent above, becoming shorter downward, gray or brownish 
in color; these finally fall away, leaving the inner peridium with a 
brown or purplish-brown, smooth, shining surface. Subgleba occupy- 
ing from one-third to one-half of the peridium ; mass of spores and 
capillitium olivaceous, then brownish-purple; the threads branched, the 
main stem about as thick as the spores, with slender, tapering branches. 
Spores globose, distinctly warted, 5-6/x in diameter.

broad, generally narrowed below into a short stem-like base, white ci- 
nereous or brownish, mealy-spinulose, hairy-spinulose, echinate or stel- 
lately echinate, when denuded smooth and subshining; capillitium and 
spores finally purplish-brown, columella present. Spores rough, 5-6/u. in 
diameter. 

Sandy pastures, woods and bushy places. Common. August to 
October. 

This appears to be one of the most polymorphous species we have. 
It is so variable that I have been obliged to modify the usual description 
very much, in order to include forms which are quite diverse, yet which 
appear to me to run together in such a way that I am unable to draw 
any satisfactory line of distinction between them. 

There are three principal varieties which I have referred to this 
species. The first is usually 1-2 in. broad, sessile, or with a very short 
stem, nearly smooth, being mealy or pruinose, and having a few minute, 
weak, scattered spinules or scales. Its color is generally whitish or 
white slightly clouded with brown. It grows in sandy pastures and 
cleared lands, and is probably the nearest of the three in its resemblance 
to the type. 

I regard the second and third as worthy of a name and designate and 
define them as follows : 

Var. hirtel'lum. Peridium hairy-spinulose with erect or curved 
sometimes stellately united spinules, which are often of a blackish color. 

Ground and decaying vegetable matter in woods. 

. Var. stella re. Peridium echinate or stellately echinate with rather 
stout easily deciduous spines. 

Ground in woods and bushy places. 

In this species the capillitium and spores are at first greenish*yellow, 
olive-tinted or brownish; but when fully mature they are purple-tinted. 
Some care will, therefore, be necessary, lest the last variety be confused

(After Morgan.) 



Gastromycetes 

Lycoperdon. L. elonga'tum Berk. elongated. Peridium globose above, con- 
tracted below into a stout thick base, more or less elongated and cylin- 
dric or tapering downward ; mycelium composed of thick fibers. Cor- 
tex a loose flocculose white or yellowish coat, drying up into a mealy 
or furfuraceous persistent layer, which scarcely reveals the pale shining 
surface of the inner peridium. Subgleba occupying more than half the 
interior of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium pale olivaceous, 
then pale brown or finally purplish ; the threads much branched, the 
main stem much thicker than the spores, the branches tapering. Spores 
globose, distinctly warted, 5.5-6.5^ in diameter. 

Growing on the ground in damp woods. Ohio, Morgan. Peridium 
1-2 in. in diameter and 2-3 in. in height, the base %-i in. in thick- 
ness. In form it somewhat resembles L. gemmatum, but it has a cor-

L. el'egans Morgan elegant. Peridium large, depressed globose, 
plicate underneath and sometimes with a narrow umboniform base, 
which is continuous with the thick root. Cortex at first flocculose, 
white or yellowish, drying up into a dense furfuraceous persistent coat, 
which becomes ochraceous or brownish in color, and sometimes ob- 
scurely areolate. Subgleba broad, convex above, occupying a third 
part or more of the peridium ; mass of spores and capillitium olivaceous, 
then pale-brown or finally purplish-brown; the threads much branched, 
the main stem thicker than the spores, the branches long and tapering. 
Spores globose, distinctly warted, 5-6> in diameter. 

Growing on rich soil on the open prairie about Iowa City, la., Prof. 
T. H. McBride. Peridium 1^3 in. in diameter. In form and size 
this species somewhat resembles Calvatia fragilis, but the threads are ar-

L. rimula'tum Pk. rimula, a small chink. Peridium depressed Lycoperdon. 
globose or broadly obovoid, plicate under- 
neath with a slender fibrous mycelium. 
Cortex at first a thin, smooth, continuous 
fibrillose layer, gray or bluish-gray, some- 
times with a purplish tinge; this at length 
breaks into a network of fine lines or fis- 
sures, gradually dries up into minute thin 
adnate scales, and finally falls away from 
the smooth grayish or purplish-brown 
surface of the inner peridium. Subgleba 
broad, but distinct, plane above, occupy- 
ing about a fourth part of the peridium ; 
mass of spores and capillitium purplish- 
gray, then brownish-purple; the threads 

simple or scarcely branched, variable in thickness, but always thinner

subcylindric, arising from a fibrous mycelium. Cortex consisting of 
long, thick, erect spines or warts of irregular shape, with intervening 
smaller ones, whitish or gray in color, sometimes with a tinge of red or 
brown ; the larger spines first fall away, leaving pale spots on the sur- 
face, and giving it a reticulate appearance. Subgleba variable in amount, 
usually more than half the peridium ; mass of spores and capillitium 
greenish-yellow, then pale-brown; threads simple or scarcely branched, 
about as thick as the spores. Spores globose, even or very minutely

Var. hir'tum. Turbinate, subsessile, hairy with soft, slender warts 
which generally become blackish. 

Var. papilla'tum. Subrotund, sessile, papillose, furfuraceous-pul- 
verulent. 

Very common and known in all countries. It is, to my thinking, our 
prettiest puff-ball. Its beautifully studded surface, reminding of ex- 
quisite settings, is in itself worth studying for the designs. It is usually 
solitary or in small groups, but at times these groups contain scores of

individuals. It grows in the open on the ground or from both ground Lycoperdon. 
and wood, in woods. 

I think it equal to any other puff-ball. But great care must betaken 
to examine each specimen before putting it into the pan. A single one, 
which has turned yellow in the slightest degree, will spoil a whole dish. 
And this is the case with any of the small puff-balls. One ageing L. 
pyriforme will embitter a hundred. 

L. perla'tum Pers. perfero, to endure. (Enduring through winter.) 
Peridium turbinate, broad and depressed above, plicate underneath 
and contracted into a short and pointed or sometimes elongated and 
tapering base; mycelium fibrous. Cortex of long slender spines, 
mingled with smaller spinules and warts, gray brown or blackish in 
color; the longer spines first fall away, leaving a reticulate surface to 
the inner peridium. Subgleba occupying one-third to one-half of the 
peridium ; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then brown- 
ish-olivaceous ; the threads mostly simple, some of them thicker than 
the spores. Spores globose, even or very minutely warted, 3.5-4.5^

Center, Brewerton and Catskill mountains. Autumn. Oneida. Warne. 
The pedicellate spores constitute the peculiar feature of this species. 
It is one which suggests the name and which enables the species to be 
easily distinguished from all its allies. The spore is terminally and per- 
sistently attached to the pedicel, as in some species of Bovista. The 
plant is sometimes sessile, but usually it is narrowed below into a stem- 
like base. In the immature ^state it has a rough, shaggy appearance, 
but the spines shrivel with age so that it appears less rough when old. 
The pitted surface of the denuded peridium affords a mark of distinc- 
tion from L. echinatum. L. pulcherrimum B. and C. is evidently the 
same species, but the name here adopted has priority of publication.

LYCOPERDON SEPARANS 

With magnified spores. 

(After Morgan.) 



Lycoperdacese 

This is another very variable species. The typical form is a small one, Lycoperdon. 
minutely echinate and having the denuded peridium smooth. The plant 
often occurs much larger and more coarsely echinate with stout 
angular spines or pyramidal warts, which fall off and generally leave 
the surface of the peridium velvety. 

Var. typ'icum. Small, 69 lines broad, globose, minutely echinate, 
the warts quickly falling off and leaving the peridium smooth. (L. 
Wrightii B. and C.) 

Var. sep' arans. Larger, 1024 lines broad, subglobose or lentiform, 
echinate with coarse substellate spines or pyramidal warts, which at 
length fall off and leave the peridium smooth or velvety. (L. separans 
Pk.) 

Var. atropunc 'ttim . Larger, 1015 lines broad, subglobose, pure 
white, warts or coarse spines brown or blackish at the tips. 

This species is generally gregarious, but sometimes it forms tufts of 
several individuals closely crowded together. It sometimes occurs in 
cultivated grounds and stubble fields. The under surface is occasionally 
plicate as in the long-stemmed puff-ball. In the var. separans the 
warts or spines are crowded at their thickened bases and slightly at- 
tached to each other, so that they come off at maturity in flakes or 
patches. When the denuded surface of the p*eridium is velvety, it is 
usually of a darker color than when smooth, being subcinnamon, reddish- 
brown or dark-brown. Peck, 32d Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

GENUS XI. CATAS'TOMA Morg. 

Puff-balls growing just beneath the surface of the ground and con- Catastoma. 
nected immediately with it by filamentous threads, which issue from 
every part of the cortex; after maturity, when the peridium breaks 
away, the lower part of the outer coat is held fast by the soil, while the 
upper portion which has attained the surface remains, covering the in- 
ner peridium like a cap or inverted cup ; consequently the apparent 
apex at which the mouth is situated is the actual base of the plant as it 
grows. The capillitium threads are similar to the densely interwoven 
hyphas, which form the inner peridium and are evidently branches of 
them radiating from the interior. It is plain that the affinities of these 
plants are closest with Tylostoma and Astrasus, but the needs of a sys- 
tematic arrangement, according to more obvious characters, causes us 
to place them next to Bo vista. Morgan.

growing along brook-banks or under trees, generally choosing hard 
ground, are known to all who observe Nature's curiosities. When quite 
young they are white inside. As they enlarge the center darkens and 
this purplish color finally develops into a grayish-purplish-black which 
extends throughout the interior and gives it a granular appearance. 
The fungus is solid, cutting like a potato. Its smell is strong; also its 
taste when raw. Sliced and well-cooked the species is good, even after 
it has become purplish, but if a single one is wilted it will embitter a 
whole dish. Or if it is not very well stewed or fried it remains strong. 
In no condition is it injurious. Specimens must be pared, and the base

TOADSTOOL POISONING AND ITS TREATMENT 

BY W. S. CARTER, M. D. 

Professsor of Physiology and Hygiene, University of Texas, Galveston, Texas. 

THE poisonous mushrooms v or so-called toadstools, may be grouped 
in two classes: (i) Those containing minor or irritant poisons, which 
act locally on the gastro-intestinal tract, such as the Clitocybe illudens, 
Lepiota Morgani and others, and (2) those containing major poisons 
which act on the nerve centers after absorption, causing symptoms to 
appear a long time after the poison has been taken and very often ter- 
minating fatally. This group includes the Amanita muscaria, the 
Amanita bulbosa or Am. verna and the Amanita phalloides. 

From the prompt way in which vomiting and purging begin after 
eating the toadstools of the first group there seems to be no doubt of the 
local irritant action on the alimentary canal. Grave symptoms from 
any constitutional effect or any serious disturbances of the circulation do 
not occur. Although intensely disagreeable, such poisoning terminates 
in recovery and may not be regarded as dangerous unless the poison be 
taken in enormous quantity or by one in poor health. 

In poisoning by the deadly toxic Amanitae vomiting and purging may 
also occur as prominent symptoms, but generally only occur late ten 
to fifteen hours after eating the toadstool and are due to the action of 
the poison on the nerve centers. This is clear from the fact that these 
symptoms appear when the poison is given either hypodermatically or 
intravenously to animals. 

It is exceedingly unfortunate that these deadly poisonous toadstools 
do not give some warning either in an unpleasant taste or contain an 
irritant which would act locally to cause emesis and purgation, for in 
that case the patient would get rid of the poison before such large 
quantities were absorbed and fatal poisoning would be less frequent. 
They are not at all unpalatable and sometimes large quantities are eaten 
by mistake 

621 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

Formerly frequent allusion was made to the possibility of poisoning 
by decomposition products from putrefactive changes in mushrooms. 
Not a single case has come to the writer's notice where this form of 
poisoning has actually occurred. In many reported cases of poisoning 
it is distinctly stated they were eaten soon after gathering ; in none does 
the reporter mention any suspicion of poisoning of this nature. 

At one time very many mushrooms were supposed to be poison- 
ous. We now know that there are only a few dangerous ones, and 
where serious poisoning occurs it seems clearly to be due to some defi- 
nite and constant poisons contained in certain fungi. We shall not deal 
here with the irritant poisons, as they are not dangerous and usually 
Nature gets rid of them easily, but shall consider the poisons of the 
Amanita muscaria or "Fly mushroom," the A. bulbosus vernus Bull, or 
A. verna, and the A. phalloides or "death cup." The writer has not had 
any personal experience with poisoning by these in man, but bases his 
observations upon over one hundred experiments made upon lower ani- 
mals.* This is a distinct advantage in reaching any conclusion, as the facts 
are definite without any doubt as to the kind or quantity of the poison 
taken. In many of the reports of poisoning by mushrooms in man no 
mention of the species is made. In all these cases many kinds have been 
mixed together in preparing them for the table and it has never been known 
how many of the poisonous and how many of the edible ones have been 
eaten by any one individual partaking of the dish. Of course the fluid 
in which they are cooked contains some of the poison. This explains 
why some patients recover after having eaten several mushrooms while 
others die from a part of one only. (See report of six cases by Dr. G. E. 
Caglieri, New York Med. Record, August 28, 1897; a ^ so Dr. Berry's 
cases reported by Prentiss, Philadelphia Med. Journal, September 24, 
1898.) Then, too, different poisonous species may be mixed together. 
The symptoms produced by the different Amanitae poisons are quite 
different. Those containing irritant poisons may be taken with those 
containing deadly poisons. This accounts for the great variety of symp- 
toms presented in cases reported. 

*A11 of the toadstools used have been very kindly furnished and identified by Capt. 
Chas. Mcllvaine. Unfortunately only fifteen experiments could be made with the fresh 
funpi while the writer was at the University of Pennsylvania. Since leaving there it 
has been impossible to get any in a fresh state, and the other experiments have been 
made either with dried fungi or alcoholic or glycerine extracts of the fresh. 

622 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

POISONING BY AMANITA MUSCARIA. 

The symptoms of poisoning by this fungus usually appear from eight 
to twelve hours after it has been eaten, unless it has been taken in 
enormous quantities, as in the cases reported by Prentiss (Phila. Med. 
Jour., September 24, 1898), where they came on in half an hour. 

These begin with cramp-like pains in the extremities, colicky pains 
in the abdomen, burning thirst, vomiting and purging. The pulse may 
be very slow and strong at first, but later becomes rapid, small and fee- 
ble. The blood pressure is low and, as a result of this disturbance of 
the circulation, faintness is a common early symptom. Extreme pallor 
is often noticed. The secretions are increased, and the sweat and the 
saliva may be secreted in abnormal quantities. 

The pupils are strongly contracted and dullness of the vision or 
double vision may be noticed early. 

The respirations are slow and become shallow and stertorous when 
the poisoning is severe. 

The mental state may be clear at first, but becomes dull, deepening 
into unconsciousness and deep coma if a large quantity has been taken. 

Convulsions are reported to have occurred in some cases from poison- 
ing by this toadstool in man. The dried Amanita muscaria or extracts 
of the fresh fail to produce convulsions in the lower animals, even in 
frogs, which are very susceptible. Either there is a considerable dif- 
ference in the susceptibility to this poison or there is some poison pres- 
ent in the fresh fungus which is lost by drying. 

Small amounts of the dried Amanita muscaria are said to be used by 
inhabitants of northern Asia for the stimulating effect upon the nervous 
system, producing, like other narcotic poisons, a dreamy state of intoxi- 
cation, deepening into sleep (Von Boeck in Ziemssen's Cyclopedia of 
Medicine, Vol. VII). 

In animals the most striking effect is upon the circulation. When in- 
jected intravenously it causes tremendous inhibition of the heart's action 
a moderate amount causing the heart to beat slowly and powerfully ; 
a large amount causing complete arrest. Even with the partial inhibi- 
tion there is an enormous fall of pressure. The slowing of the heart 
soon passes off, and when a moderate amount has been injected, the cir- 
culation quickly returns to normal. 

623 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

In one of my experiments on a dog, the heart stopped for i% min- 
utes and then began beating again, the circulation soon recovering. 

Late in the poisoning the heart beats may be rapid and feeble and the 
blood pressure low. The lowered blood pressure is largely due to 
dilatation of the small blood vessels resulting from a loss of control over 
them by the nerve center which normally keeps the arterioles in a state 
of partial contraction. 

The inhibition of the heart is due to the action of the well-known 
alkaloid muscarine upon nerve ganglia in the heart. The contraction 
of the pupil and the increased secretory activity of the glands are also 
due to this substance which was discovered by Schmideberg and Koppe 
in 1869. 

It was soon found that although dogs recovered from the immediate 
or early effects (i. e., from the muscarine) of enormous quantities of toad- 
stools, they succumbed from the late effects of much smaller quantities. 
Atropine fails to avert this result from the late effect, whether given be- 
fore the poison, with it, or after it. The inhibition of the heart passes 
off long before death occurs. Late death does not appear to be due to 
muscarine. 

*A11 these facts put together point to the existence of some other 
poison or poisons in the Amanita muscaria to which atropine is not an 
antidote. 

This peculiar poisoning causing death so late will be discussed again 
after considering the other poisonous mushrooms as they act similarly. 

Gastro-intestinal symptoms were not as common in my experiments 
with Amanita muscaria as with the Amanita phalloides. Vomiting and 
purging occasionally occurred early, but much more frequently late in 
the poisoning and often not at all. 

Convulsions did not occur in any of the animals poisoned by this 
fungus. Convulsions are recorded in some cases of poisoning in man, 
but not so constantly as with the A. phalloides and A. verna. Where 
they occurred either a large amount had been taken (as in Prentiss' 
case) or there is some doubt about the Amanita muscaria having been 
the only toadstool eaten (as in Caglieri's cases). Frogs are very easily 
thrown into spasms, but no spasms were observed, even in fatal poison- 
ing of them by this toadstool. 

Regarding cerebral symptoms, little can be said except that uncon-

terminating fatally the animal seemed to be conscious, but so depressed 
that it was unable to stand' or even move when called. 

Concerning differences in the susceptibility of different animals to the 
poisons of Amanita muscaria, cats seemed to be more susceptible than 
dogs in the earlier experiments with extracts of the fresh fungus, but 
more numerous experiments with the dried fungus failed to show any 
greater difference than can be observed between different animals of the 
same kind. 

As to the nature of the poisons very little can be stated from the ex- 
periments, as they were undertaken as a preliminary step to chemical 
studies to be carried on later. The alkaloid muscarine is one of our 
best known poisons and nothing can be added to what is already known 
about it. The poisons are extracted by distilled water as well as by a 
solution of sodium chloride; they are soluble in glycerine and in alcohol 
and very little difference can be seen in the action of these extracts, un- 
less the alcoholic extract contains more of the muscarine, while the 
glycerine extract contains more of the other poisons. 

It is stated that muscarine is not poisonous to flies ; that the Amanita 
muscaria contains a volatile poison which is poisonous to flies (hence 
the name "Fly mushroom" ), and which is lost by drying; that inhabit- 
ants of northern Asia use the dried fungus (after the volatile poison has 
been lost) for producing intoxication (Von Boeck in Ziemssen's Cyclo- 
pedia, Vol. VII, p. 927). My experiments have been entirely with 
mammals and frogs, and unfortunately those performed with the fresh 
toadstools were not numerous enough to enable me to draw positive 
conclusions as to any loss of toxicity by drying. A single experiment 
with a cat seemed to indicate that boiling of the fungus lessened the 
toxicity but subsequent experiments indicated that a boiled solution was 
no less toxic than one not boiled. 

One thing we can state definitely; that boiling the dried A. muscaria 
abes not destroy its toxicity. This indicates that the poison is not of 
an albuminous nature, which would be coagulated by heat. 

Whether or not any volatile poison is lost by boiling a solution of the 
fresh fungus or by drying at 40 C. can not be stated definitely as the 
experiments made with the fresh fungus were few in number on account 
of the extreme difficulty in getting them perfectly fresh. 

The average of six observations in which it was possible to weigh 
the toadstools before and after drying at 40 C. showed a loss of 84.4 
40 625 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

per cent, of water. In other words, i gram of the dried equals 6.4 
grams of the fresh. 

Comparing the lethal doses of the dried with the lethal doses of the 
fresh extracted by glycerine and alcohol, it does not appear that there 
is any great loss of the toxicity by drying as is shown by the following : 
Lethal dose of dried in Experiment 31 was .085 gram, per kilo of body 
weight; in Experiment 55, .033 gram, per kilo caused early death, 
while .223 gram, of dried per kilo and .120 gram, per kilo caused 
death from late effects (Exps. 32 and 57). The lethal doses of the fresh 
were .91 gram, per kilo (Exp. 29) and 1.055 gram, per kilo (Exp. 
36) when a glycerine extract of the fresh growth was used, while 1.222 
gram, per kilo (Exp. 16) made from an alcoholic extract failed to kill. 

It may be well to introduce here the results of an experiment which 
shows there is no highly poisonous volatile material given off from the 
A. phalloides. This is rather an important fact to determine, as the 
opinion is held by some that there is a volatile poison, and most of my 
experiments were made with the dried fungus. A I per cent, solution 
of fresh A. phalloides was distilled until three-fourths of the fluid had 
passed over as distillate. The latter was injected into the vein of a dog 
and found not at all toxic. The opportunity has not been afforded me 
of repeating this experiment personally, but Dr. J. P. Arnold has kindly 
repeated it for me, injecting the distillate into rabbits and frogs and failed 
to find it toxic. Certainly if there is any volatile poison in the A. phal- 
loides it must be either in very minute quantity or very slightly toxic. 

ANTIDOTAL VALUE OF ATROPINE. 

In arriving at any conclusion we must bear in mind the variation of 
different animals in their susceptibility to poisons. Thus, to give the 
greatest difference observed, .085 gram, dried Amanita muscaria 
per kilo of body weight killed one dog in an hour, while in another 
dog .223 grams, of the same preparation per kilo only killed after 24 
hours, the cardiac inhibition having disappeared one-half hour after the 
poison was injected. However, an average of six (6) experiments on 
cats and dogs with dried A. muscaria in which no antidote was given 
shows the lethal dose to be .103 gram, per kilo of body weight. The 
average of four (4) experiments, in which the fungus, dried in the same 
way, was used but atropine was given as an antidote, gives the lethal 
dose of .335 gram, per kilo and death only occurred late in each case. 

626 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

There can be no doubt, therefore, of the antidotal value of atropine for 
poisoning by Amanita muscaria. 

It should be borne in mind, however, that it is not an infallible anti- 
dote even when given early, and that it does not prevent death from the 
late effects in severe cases, although given in large doses. In some ex- 
periments atropine was administered at the same time the poison was 
given and in others before it. t 

The important practical lesson is that too much reliance should not 
be placed upon atropine. It will be shown later that it has little value 
as an antidote to A. verna and A. phalloides. Probably these fungi 
contain less muscarine than A. muscaria. Although there is no drug 
so antagonistic in its physiological action to the poison of the A. mus- 
caria as atropine, the use of other remedies should not be neglected. 
The symptoms have to be treated as they arise. Strychnia, alcohol in 
moderate amounts and suprarenal extract could all be used to ad- 
vantage in restoring the circulation, especially late in the poisoning. 
Atropine merely removes the inhibition of the heart which occurs as an 
early symptom. 

External heat should be applied if the body temperature is sub- 
normal. The treatment of gastro-intestinal symptoms will depend upon 
the conditions of each individual case. The injection of a large amount 
of warm physiological salt solution (.6 .7 per cent, sodium chloride) 
into the subcutaneous tissues should also be tried in severe cases seen 
late in the poisoning. 

POISONING BY AMANITA VERNA OR A. BULBOSUS VERNA BULL. 

The symptoms appear from six to fifteen hours after the ingestion of 
the poison and may be largely choleraic in nature, i. e. t vomiting and 
purging, the discharges from the bowel being watery with small flakes 
suspended and sometimes containing blood. 

The disturbance of the circulation is somewhat similar to that caused 
by A. muscaria, viz., slow, strong pulse early, but rapid and weak later. 
Dizziness and faintness may be early symptoms. Sometimes the skin 
is pale and covered with cold, clammy sweat; at others there is great 
cyanosis. The body temperature is subnormal, unless nervous symp- 
toms are very severe. Very prominent among the symptoms are tetanic 
convulsions, which may appear comparatively early and persist until 
the end. 

627 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

In animals the effect of this toadstool is entirely different from that of 
A. muscaria. Perhaps the most striking difference is the frequency 
with which convulsions appear. Convulsions occurred repeatedly in 
mammals and in nearly every frog to which the toadstool was given. 
This fungus seems to contain some poison that acts upon the spinal cord 
very much as strychnia does, though less powerfully, of course. 

The circulatory conditions are also different. The inhibition of the 
heart may be pronounced as an early condition, but the pressure does 
not return to the normal after this disappears, either from giving 
atropine or from cutting the pneumogastric nerves. Section of these 
nerves removes the cardiac inhibition much more completely than after 
poisoning by the A. muscaria. There is often a fall of pressure without 
cardiac inhibition. In other words, there is a much greater permanent 
fall of blood-pressure due to paralysis of the nerve center controlling 
the blood vessels (vaso-motor center). This condition will last a long 
time and does not show the same tendency to disappear as after A. 
muscaria. Moreover it is produced by comparatively small amounts 
of the A. verna. 

The respirations are very slow. The blood is poorly oxygenated and 
this probably causes the cyanosis sometimes observed in men poisoned 
by this fungus. 

Bloody fluid is sometimes vomited or comes from the nose. It may 
also occur in the discharge from the bowel. 

Retching and purging occurred more frequently as early symptoms 
than in animals poisoned by A. muscaria. 

Coma appeared early and continued until death. The administration 
of atropine soon after giving the poison when cardiac inhibition was 
present, caused a slight temporary rise of blood pressure but did not 
affect the dilated condition of the blood vessels. The pressure con- 
tinued low notwithstanding the atropine. Although the experiments 
with this fungus were not as numerous as with the A. muscaria because 
of difficulty in obtaining it, yet it seems clear that atropine is of very 
little value as an antidote. Death very rarely resulted from the cardiac 
inhibition occurring early but usually came on late after that condition 
had disappeared. The lethal dose was no larger when atropine was 
given than when no antidote was used. 

Amanita verna is very much more toxic than A. muscaria, the average 
of four experiments in which the former was given without an antidote 

628 



Toadstool Poisoning and. its Treatment 

being .034 gram, (dried) per kilo of body weight, while .103 gram, 
(dried) per kilo, was the average for the latter fungus. 

POISONING BY AM ANITA PHALLOIDES. 

The symptoms described in man are very similar to those caused by 
the A. verna, except that the convulsions are less constant and cyanosis 
is not mentioned. In some cases vomiting and purging are prominent 
symptoms. There is dizziness and fainting, extreme ashy pallor, cold 
skin covered with sweat, subnormal temperature, muscular twitchings 
and occasional convulsions and somnolence which deepens into coma 
and lasts until death, which usually occurs two or three days after eating 
the poison. Sometimes the gastro-intestinal symptoms are less severe 
or may be absent, though they are usually present; in that case the 
nervous symptoms are more prominent, particularly the convulsions and 
circulatory disturbance. 

In experiments upon animals the convulsions were not observed so 
constantly as with the A. verna. Out of twenty-five dogs poisoned by the 
Amanita phalloides, convulsions only occurred twice, while twelve frogs 
injected with different preparations (dried toadstool and glycerine and 
alcoholic extracts of the fresh) failed to show a convulsive seizure in a 
single instance. It seems to be difficult for mycologists to draw a sharp 
line between the A. verna and the A. phalloides and say to which of 
these two certain fungi belong. This may explain why convulsions are 
recorded more frequently in persons poisoned by this toadstool than in 
animals poisoned by it. Frogs are very susceptible to poisons acting 
upon the spinal cord, and all of those poisoned by lethal doses of A. 
verna had convulsions, while none of those poisoned by the A. phal- 
loides had any. It would therefore appear from this striking difference 
in the physiological actions that the two are separate and distinct. 

The circulatory and gastro-intestinal symptoms were quite similar to 
those caused by the A. verna. 

A. phalloides is less toxic than the A. verna, but more so than the 
A. muscaria, the average lethal dose of the dried fungus (eight experi- 
ments) for dogs, where no antidote was used, being .117 gram, per 
kilo. 

The antidotal value of atropine is very slight, if indeed it has any 
action other than removing the temporary cardiac inhibition. The ani- 
mals very seldom died from this, but mostly from the late effects after 

629 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

the inhibition had disappeared. In four experiments on dogs in which 
atropine was given either at the same time as the poison or before it, 
the average lethal dose was .198 gram, of the dried fungus per kilo. 
Two dogs were killed by .1 gram, per kilo without atropine; another 
was given the same amount and was given atropine hypodermatically a 
number of times and recovered, though very ill for two days. 

Transfusion of physiological salt solution (.6 per cent, table salt) 
was practiced in three dogs. Although death occurred in all of these 
and the lethal dose was not unusually high, the pressure was restored 
for a time at least. It should be employed in treating poisoning in man, 
and not be depended upon as the only procedure, but used in conjunc- 
tion with other remedies. This will be referred to again in describing 
treatment. 

It will be seen from the above that poisoning by the A. verna and 
A. phalloides present symptoms in the lower animals which are quite 
different from those caused by the A. muscaria, and that in either case 
poisoning is far more serious than by the latter fungus. This is not only 
because they are so much more toxic, but also because there is no de- 
cidedly antagonistic action by atropine, and hence its value as an anti- 
dote is much less. 

In treating a case of poisoning by either A. verna or A. phalloides the 
only thing that can be done is to meet the indications in the individual 
case. If the heart is beating slowly, atropine should be given in liberal 
doses. This will not overcome the chief disturbance of the circulation, 
viz., the tremendous dilation of the blood vessels. Strychnia will do 
this to a certain extent, but its use may be contra-indicated by twitch- 
ings or convulsions from the toadstools. If it can be used it is exceed- 
ingly valuable, as it stimulates not only the vaso-motor center^ but the 
respiration and heart as well . Caffein or strong coffee may also be used 
to this end if the stomach will retain it. Suprarenal extract should 
also be given hypodermatically, as it will restore the blood pressure more 
nearly to normal than any other drug, according to our experiments. 
It has the advantage of not increasing the excitability of the spinal cord 
as strychnia does, and hence would not be contra-indicated by nervous 
symptoms. 

Perhaps the most rational treatment to meet the most serious condi- 
tion of the poisoning by these toadstools is the transfusion of normal 
saline solution (.6-. 7 per cent, solution of table salt) into the subcu- 

630 



-toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

taneous tissues. This should, of course, only be given by a physician, 
as great care is required in sterilizing the syringe. It can be given with 
a fountain syringe and aspirating needle beneath the skin of the thigh. 
Large quantities should be used at least a quart ( 1000 cc. ) or more. 
The fluid is rapidly absorbed by the lymphatics and gets into the blood 
vessels. It restores the blood pressure by increasing the fluid in the 
vessels and also doubtless aids the organs of excretion in eliminating the 
poison ; at the same time it would relieve the intense thirst patients 
complain of. Clinicians who have observed cases of poisoning by the 
A. phalloides in man have suggested this procedure as the most rational 
one to meet the symptoms presented. From the condition produced 
in animals poisoned by this toadstool the writer was led to the same 
conclusion. In two experiments upon dogs, when transfusion of warm 
physiological salt solution was made directly into the vein after poison- 
ing by the A. phalloides, death occurred in both cases and the lethal 
dose was not unusually large, although the amount transferred was equal 
to the estimated volume of the blood of the animal in one case and half 
that amount in another. In another animal atropine was given before 
the poison and the pressure had been reduced by the latter to one-fifth 
of the normal, the transfusion of an amount of normal salt solution 
equivalent to two-thirds of the bulk of blood restored the pressure to 
three-fourths of normal in about 15 minutes, but further injection of the 
poison caused late death. 

Although the rise of pressure is not so great from transfusion as from 
suprarenal extract in large doses, it is more permanent. Transfusion 
(or transfusion into the subcutaneous tissues by hypodermoclysis which 
amounts to the same thing) has the additional advantage of increasing 
the flow of urine, which is often suppressed in these cases. Even if it 
does no good it can do no harm if done antiseptically and should be 
tried but always in conjunction with other remedies. 

A remarkable case of recovery after the injection of a large amount 
of normal saline solution has been reported by Delobel (Presse medicale 
September 30, 1899). A man aged fifty-two ate some A. phalloides; 
he was seen four hours afterward. The skin was covered with cold, 
clammy sweat ; body temperature was sub-normal ; shivering and 
tremors present; had not vomitedor purged ; urine suppressed; respira- 
tion stertorous; pulse 28 per minute and so feeble that it was almost 
imperceptible. Two full doses of atropine were given hypodermatically 

631 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

as well as 10 cc. of ether and 200 cc. of strong coffee with 20 cc. of 
rum were given by the mouth and hot bottles applied externally. In 
spite of all this the symptoms became worse and the patient sank into a 
condition of profound collapse, the pulse dropping to 24 per minute 
and the tremors ceased. One liter ( i quart) of normal saline solution 
was injected hypodermatically and improvement began in 15 minutes 
after the injection. The respiration lost the Cheyne-Stokes character; 
the pulse improved in tension and in an hour was 60 per minute ; the 
skin improved and the temperature returned to normal and the patient 
went to work next day. 

The circulatory symptoms are most prominent and demand most 
attention. Vomiting and purging have to be treated according to the 
conditions in the individual case and no rule can be followed. As the 
peripheral vessels are dilated the body temperature is usually subnormal. 
This should be overcome by applying hot bottles externally. 

The suppression of urine should receive attention, and the activity of 
the kidneys be stimulated as much as possible. It is probable the sup- 
pression is largely due to the tremendous fall of blood pressure. If the 
urine is secreted but retained in the bladder it should be drawn off. 

Just as there is no simple way of detecting the presence of poisonous 
mushrooms in a mixture of mushrooms, so there is no simple way of 
destroying or removing the poisons. Pouchet stated that boiling de- 
stroyed the poison and Chestnut has stated the poison of A. phalloides 
is a toxic albumen. If this were the case boiling would destroy it. In 
our experiments, however, boiling has not diminished the toxicity at 
all and it can be definitely stated that the poison is not an albumen. 

There is also a popular impression that vinegar will remove the poison 
and numerous observers claim to have removed the poison of A. mus- 
caria completely by soaking the fungus in vinegar. We have not had 
the opportunity of trying this with fresh A. muscaria, but in one experi- 
ment in which the A. verna was soaked over night in vinegar it failed 
to get rid of the poison any more than would have dissolved in that 
amount of water. 

Toadstool poisoning differs from most poisonings in the long time 
elapsing before death in fatal cases. The only inorganic poisons caus- 
ing death after such a long interval produce profound tissue changes. 
Husemann believed death from poisonous mushrooms to be due to fatty 
degeneration of the various organs. We have examined microscopically 

632 



Toadstool Poisoning and its Treatment 

the tissue of dogs and cats dying from the late effects of the A. mus- 
caria and A. phalloides and found them to be perfectly normal. 

Mr. V. K. Chestnut, in a bulletin published by the United States 
Department of Agriculture (Circular No. 13, p. 23), states that death 
from the A. phalloides is due to a destruction of the red-blood corpus- 
cles. Upon what authority this assertion is made is not stated. The 
conclusion has probably been based upon the venosity of the blood in 
cases of poisoning resulting from the disturbance of the respiration and 
circulation. The blood corpuscles of animals poisoned by all three of 
the Amanitae studied have been counted repeatedly in our experiments 
and in none of them has there been any appreciable reduction. 

It can be positively stated that death is not due to a destruction ol 
the red blood cells. 

Further, the coloring matter of the blood (haemoglobin), which car- 
ries oxygen to the tissues, has been examined with the spectroscope to 
see if any new compound had been formed which would prevent it from 
carrying oxygen. No such compound has been found no alteration 
could be detected in the haemoglobin. It is quite evident that these 
toadstools do not kill by their action on the blood, for in a number of 
experiments the blood was examined a very short time before death. 

Thinking that they might act upon the nerve cells of the brain and 
spinal cord very much as certain toxins of infectious diseases do, those 
structures were examined by special staining methods (silver impregna- 
tion), but no greater variation than is normal could be detected in any 
of those examined. 

No statement can be made as to the cause of this late death, but it 
would appear to be due to some disturbance of nutrition. 

Late death occurs not only in animals, but in most of the cases of 
poisoning in man recorded in medical literature. 

The contrast between the early and late symptoms is not so great in 
poisoning by A. phalloides and A. verna as in the case of poisoning by 
A. muscaria. In the first two the serious symptoms appear early and 
continue till the end ; in the last the early effects of the muscarine soon 
passes off or can be removed by atropine, but the late symptoms, strik- 
ingly in contrast with the early ones, still appear, and continue till death.

RECIPES 

FOR 

COOKING AND PREPARING FOR THE TABLE 

PREPARING toadstools for the table should begin while collecting them. 
Have a soft brush, a knife, half a dozen one or two-pound paper bags 
and an open-topped, roomy, shallow basket. As edible species are 
Collecting". found, cut them loose well above their attachment. Keep 
Cleansing-. the spore surface down until the top is brushed clean and 
every particle of dirt removed from the stem. This prevents dirt from 
getting upon the spore surface, from which it is very hard to dislodge. 
Never clean a toadstool over other toadstools. If the stem is hard, 
tough or wormy, remove it. 

Having cleaned the plant, place it in one of the paper bags, spore 
surface down. Write its name on the bag. Place but one kind in the 
same bag, unless species of about the same texture and flavor are found 
and mixing is not objectionable. Where another species is found, give 
it a bag to itself. 

Select fresh, inviting plants only. Do all possible cleaning in the 

field. Plants keep clean, pack better, and more of them

can be carried. A careless jumble is gritty, bruised 

and disappointing. 

If not ready to cook the find, place the bags in the ice chest. It is 
best to cook fungi as soon as possible. Cooked, they can be kept much 
longer than when uncooked. 

When ready to cook, wash the plants by throwing them into a deep 
pan of water. Pass the fingers quietly through them

upward; let stand a moment for the dirt to settle, then 
gather them from the water with the fingers as a drain. Remove any 
scurf or adhering dirt with a coarse flannel or a cloth. Wash in this way 
through two or three waters. Lay to drain. By experience in drain- 
ing, exactly the amount of water necessary to cook a particular species

can be allowed to remain within its spore surface, if it is a gilled species. 
To other kinds, water must usually be added. 

The removal of the skin of any toadstool is seldom justifiable. As 
with the apple and most fruits, the largest amount of flavor is in the 
skin. 

By the consistency of the species in hand, decide upon the best 
method of cooking it and the time and medium required. If it is thin, 
juicy, tender, from five to ten minutes' slow stewing will be ample; if 
it is thick, dry, tough, from thirty to forty minutes will be required. 
After any species is cooked tender, it may be seasoned to one's liking 
and served as one chooses. 

Many species, which absolutely refuse to become tender after prolonged 
stewing, quickly succumb in the frying pan and make crisp, delicate 
morsels. Edible kinds which dry well, or are hard when found, often 
grate or powder easily, and are excellent (after soaking) made into 
soups, fritters or pates. 

Hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for cooking the common mush- 
room and the few other fungi heretofore eaten, are at hand. The 
simpler methods those which retain the natural flavor of the species 
cooked are the best. 

When a species has good body, and but little flavor, it may be made 
delicious by cooking with it another species of higher flavor. 

The most concise instruction is : Cook in any way you can cook an 
oyster. 

The writer's best and long- tried recipes are here given. Mrs. Sarah 
Tyson Rorer has kindly contributed some of her own choice methods ; 
Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, of culinary celebrity, is represented; and that 
every recipe needed may be found herein, the most sensible of English 
and French recipes are given. 

TO COOK MUSHROOMS. 

Gather mushrooms whenever they can be found. That is the best 
time of the day to collect them. The gills grow darker and the flavor 
improves as the spores ripen. They are in good condition up to the 
time the gills begin to grow moist and to soften. 

Cut off the extreme butt of the stem, holding the gills downward. 
Rub off the cap and stem with a rough towel or flannel. Do not peel. 
Wash in cold water. Drain well, gills downward. 

636 



Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

The English method is to scald them, but there is more of custom 
than use in it. 

Mushrooms may be preserved temporarily by boiling them in salt 
and water for five minutes, draining and wiping dry. A better way is 
to cook them, place in ice-chest, and reheat when wanted. Mcllvaine. 

To BROIL. Use well-spread caps only. Use double iron broiler. 
Place the caps on it, gills down, and broil two minutes, turn and broil 
two minutes more. While hot, season with salt and pepper, and butter 
well, especially upon the gill side. Serve upon toast. Mrs. S. T. Rorer, 

BAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST. 

Bake under a glass or basin, on toast along with scalded or clotted 
cream or a little melted butter, and salt and pepper to taste. They 
take about a quarter of an hour in a gentle oven or before a fire ; when 
they are taken up, do not remove glass for a few minutes; by that time 
the vapor will have condensed and gone into the toast. Stevens. 

CRUSTS OF MUSHROOMS. V/~ 

Cut into small, even-sized squares a pint of the selected toadstool; \ i 
stew in a little water until done; add two ounces butter and one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Wet a teaspoonful of 
flour with two gills of cream and mix with the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Add, and mix well with the toadstool. 

Cut the upper crust from some small French rolls. Scoop out the 
inside of both upper and lower part, brush them with melted butter and 
Brown in the oven; fill them, put on the top. Serve. 

Or, when cooked as directed, serve in paper cases, or pastry shells. 

TO DRY MUSHROOMS. (English method.) 

Take those neither very young nor very old. Remove the butts only. 
Then slice, string or skewer the slices lightly, and expose to a current 
of warm dry air. A warm oven, with the door open, is a good place. 
When quite dry and shrivelled, pack in tins, with spice at top and bot- 
tom. When wanted for use, soak the slices in tepid water for some 
hours. Then cook. Hay.

STEWED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST. 

Cut the mushrooms caps and stems into pieces of equal size. Place 
in a covered saucepan. To each pint add one ounce (two level table- 
spoonfuls) of butter. Enough water will have been retained by the gills 
after washing to make sufficient liquor. Stew slowly twenty minutes; 
season to taste with pepper and salt. Place upon toast. Mcllvaine. 

TO FRY MUSHROOMS. 

Lay them in a frying pan in which butter has been heated boiling 
hot. After frying five minutes serve on a hot dish pouring over them 
the sauce made by thickening the butter with a little flour. This is as 
delicious as more elaborate ways of cooking and retains the mushroom's 
distinctive flavor in full perfection. 

FRICASSE OF MUSHROOMS. 

Wash, put them into a chafing dish, sprinkle over a teaspoonful of 
salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful of black pepper, cover and cook slowly 
for five minutes. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a gill of milk, 
strain this into the mushrooms, bring to boiling point, add the yolks of 
two eggs slightly beaten, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and serve 
at once. Mrs. S. T. Rarer. 

MUSHROOM PICKLES. 

One-half peck of either Agaricus campester, Lepiota procera, Hy- 
pholoma fascicularis, Hypholoma perplexum, Clitocybe multiceps, 
Russula virescens. Select sound specimens, cut off ends of stems 
(entire stem of fascicularis or procerus), rub the tops with flannel 
dipped in salt. Throw them into milk and water (one-fourth milk). 
Drain and put them into a stew pan. Sprinkle the layers with salt 
one-half gill to one-half peck mushrooms. Cover them close and put 
them over a gentle fire for five minutes to draw out the water. Then 
put them on a coarse cloth and drain until cold (or put on mosquito 
netting in a colander). 

To prepare a pickle for them : Take one-half gallon vinegar (if strong 
dilute with water), two ounces mace, one-fourth ounce cloves, one-half 
pound salt (Worcester), one teaspoonful red pepper, one nutmeg cut 
in slices. 

Put in a jar covered with a wet cloth and keep the cloth wet. Place 
over a very slow fire, cook as long as the acid is prominent and no longer.

Take small wide-mouthed bottles, fill with the mushrooms, pour on 
the pickle until the bottle is filled. Tie down tight. (To slice a nut- 
meg, boil it in vinegar slice while hot. Makes of salt vary in strength ; 
the "Worcester" is a strong salt.) 

N. B. When H. fascicularis is used, wipe the tops with a wet cloth. 

Mcllvaine. 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. (English style.) 

Take buttons and remove butts only. Put into jars and cover with 
cold, spiced pickling vinegar. Add a few peppercorns and mustard 
seeds and seal hermetically. Hay. 

MUSHROOM CATCHUP. 

Take the opened toadstools, clean carefully, bruise them. Put a 
layer on the bottom of an earthen pan, strew salt over them (two 
tablespoonfuls to one-fourth peck), another layer, more salt and so on. 
One-half ounce cloves, one-half ounce mace, one-half ounce allspice, 
one-half ounce whole pepper. Let stand six days. Stir every day. 
Then put in gentle oven, cover pan with wet cloth, keep wet, and heat 
for four hours. Strain through a fine cloth or sieve. To every gallon 
of liquor add one quart red wine. Salt to taste. Add a race or two 
.of ginger cut small. Strain ; let catchup get cold. Pour it from the 
settlings. Bottle. Cork tight. Mcllvaine. 

MUSHROOM CATCHUP. 

A catchup superior to that sold in the stores may be made at home. 
Break the toadstools into bits and place in a stone jar, with an ounce 
and a half of salt for every quart of plants. Let stand in a cool place 
for three days, stirring several times a day. On the third day put over 
the fire, in a porcelain kettle, and heat slowly. In about half an hour 
the juice will flow freely, when strain through a hair sieve, return to the 
fire and boil twenty minutes. Measure the liquid and to each quart 
allow an ounce of ginger root, a blade of mace, a bay leaf, a pinch of 
cayenne, and an ounce each of allspice and black pepper; boil down to 
one-half the quantity, add a teaspoonful of the best brandy to each 
half-pint. Bottle. Cork and seal with wax or rosin. Anon.

MUSHROOM CATCHUP. (English style.) 

Remove the butts. Sprinkle all with salt. Pile in a bowl. Let 
them remain so for three days, stirring occasionally. Then squeeze 
out all the liquor. To each gallon of it add cloves and mustard seed, 
crushed, of each half an ounce; allspice, peppercorns and ginger, 
crushed, of each one ounce. Heat slowly up to boiling point in a 
covered vessel. Set aside in a warm place for a fortnight. Then strain 
and bottle. If the catchup shows signs of not keeping, add more salt 
and spice, heat and proceed as before. Hay. 

CANNED MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Cook together, until a light brown color, two tablespoonfuls each of 
butter and flour, add a can of button mushrooms, with the water it con- 
tains, and a cupful of water or broth. Simmer five minutes, stirring 
meanwhile, season and serve. The flavor of the mushroom is more dis- 
tinct and pronounced if the sauce is seasoned only with salt and mixed 
pepper. If broth is used in the preparation of mushroom sauce instead 
of water, it should be the broth of such meat as the sauce is to be 
served with for instance, chicken broth when to be served with chicken, 
beef broth when to be served with beef, etc. 

Mrs. Emma P. Ewing. 

FRESH MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Put in a graniteware or porcelain-lined saucepan two tablespoonfuls 
of butter. When hot add two cups of fresh, prepared mushrooms, cover 
closely, and cook briskly two or three minutes. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper, and serve with broiled beefsteak, birds, or sweetbreads. 

Mrs. E. P. Ewing. 

TO COOK BOLETI. 

Remove the stems, and the tubes unless they are compact and young, 
or the dish will be slimy from the tubes. Wipe the caps clean. 

To BROIL. Put on wire broiler or in a hot buttered pan. Cook well. 
Add butter, pepper and salt. 

To STEW. After cutting the caps in pieces of similar size, stew in a 
covered saucepan for twenty minutes. Do not use much water. When 
done, add butter, or cream, pepper and salt. Some persons may pre- 
fer to add a little lemon juice or sherry.

Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

To BAKE. Bake for half an hour in covered dish, add oil or butter, 
a little parsley, and garlic if liked, pepper and salt. 

To FRY. Remove the tubes from all the caps, excepting of very 
young or very short-tubed species. Slice the caps as you would egg- 
plant. Fry in butter, oil or fat, or dip in batter or in egg crumbs. 

Mcllvaine. 

B. EDULIS SOUP (as made in Hungary). Having dried some Boleti 
in an oven, soak them in tepid water, thickening with toast bread, till the 
whole be of the consistency of a puree, then rub them through a sieve, 
throw in some stewed Boleti, boil together, and serve with the usual 
condiments. Paulet. 

To DRY BOLETI (English method). Gather in dry weather. Re- 
move stems and tubes. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Slice. String 
the slices. Hang up in a warm place for two days. Then give them a 
minute in a moderately warm oven. Pack in tins with spice. When 
wanted steep the slices in tepid water for some hours, till they swell. 
Then proceed to dress as for fresh Bolets. The Russians retain the stems 
and dry their Bolets whole, stringing them up the stem and through the 
center of the cap. Hay. 

TO COOK CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS. 

Cut the mushrooms across and remove the stems ; put them into a 
closely-covered saucepan with a little fresh butter, and sweat them un- 
til tender, at the lowest possible temperature. A great heat always de- 
stroys the flavor. Mrs. Hussey. 

Wash, cut into pieces and put into boiling water; then stew with 
fresh butter, a little olive oil, chopped tarragon, pepper, salt and a little 
lemon peel; when cooked simmer over a slow fire for twenty minutes, 
moistening from time to time with beef gravy or cream. When ready 
to serve thicken with the yolk of egg. M. C. Cooke. 

To FRY. Dip caps in egg and bread crumbs, season with pepper and 
salt and fry in hot butter or oil. 

To STEW. Cut the whole plant into small pieces across the grain, 
stew slowly in a covered saucepan for forty minutes. Add thickened 
cream or milk. Use freely of butter and season to taste. 

To ROAST. Place in a hot dry pan over a slow fire, shake and turn 
until the plants are crisp. Butter and season with pepper and salt. A 
fine camp dish.

To PRESERVE FOR WINTER USE. Pull into strips one-half inch wide, 
spread on a piece of mosquito netting and place in the sun or current 
of warm air. When dry hang up in small bags or mosquito netting in 
a dry place. Mcllvaine. 

TO COOK CLAVARIA. 

Fry in hot butter, oil or fat until well done; or stew, covered with a 
little water, over a slow fire for half an hour. When done add cream 
or milk, a little flour, plenty of butter and season with pepper and salt. 
Salt last, always, or it will harden the plants. Mcllvaine. 

To PlCKLE (English recipe). Put the tender parts into jars with 
peppercorns, mustard seeds and nasturtium seeds. Pour on them cold 
white wine vinegar. Fill up and cork hermetically. Hay. 

TO COOK CLITOCYBE MULTICEPS. 

To BAKE. Wash caps, remove stems, let drain for a few minutes; 
place gills upward in a pan ; place on gills a small-sized lump of butter ; 
season with pepper and salt; grate cheese over each layer, cover pan, 
and place in hot oven to bake for one-half hour. 

An exceptionally fine dish. They are excellent fried. 

Other species of similar consistency may be cooked in the same way. 
See Toadstools with Cheese. Mcllvaine. 

TO COOK COPRINUS. 

"In regard to the C. micaceus I find that they are better cooked after 
the following recipe : 

"Trim the stems, wash the toadstools carefully through several waters, 
then drain them in a colander. Spread them out in a long baking pan, 
dust lightly with salt, pepper, put over a few bits of butter, cover with 
another pan and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes. Add 
four tablespoonfuls of cream, bring to boiling point; dish on toast. 

"The C. atramentarius may be cooked in precisely the same manner. 
I find that all these inky mushrooms are better cooked in a very slow 
heat in the oven, and they must be covered or they lose their flavor." 

Mrs. S. T. Rarer. 

C. comatus, or any other Coprinus, maybe treated in the same man- 
ner ; or they may be stewed slowly in a covered dish for from five to 
ten minutes. Mcllvaine. 

642 



Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

CROQUETTES. 

To one pint of any well-cooked toadstool of meaty species, add two 
hard-boiled eggs, a sprig of parsley; pepper and salt to taste; chop all 
very fine, then take two level tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour, 
put over the fire with the toadstools and eggs ; mix thoroughly together, 
set aside to cool. When cold, shape, dip in egg and bread crumbs, 
and fry in hot oil, butter or fat. Mcllvaine. 

DEVILED TOADSTOOLS. 

For deviled toadstools prepare the meat as for patties, adding the 
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to each pint of meat, a pinch of red 
pepper and a little chopped parsley. Serve hot or cold in halves of 
egg shells, nested among green. Mcllvaine. 

TO COOK FISTULINA HEPATICA. 

Mrs. Hussey says of it: "If it is not beef itself, it is sauce for it." 

It can be sliced thin and dressed as a salad with mayonnaise dressing 
or otherwise. 

The simplest and best way is to cut the fungus into slices as one 
would egg-plant. If it is small, slice it into two parts, fry in hot butter, 
season with pepper and salt. 

Another favorite way is to slice the plant across the grain, cut into 
squares of one-half inch and cook very slowly in a covered pan for 
twenty minutes. Add a little water, and plenty of butter. Season with 
pepper and salt. 

The F. hepatica always has a slightly acid taste, which is very 
acceptable to most persons, but objectionable to a few. Mcllvaine. 

SALAD. Cut in thin slices and rub them with garlic. Mingle with 
lettuce or other green salad. Dress with oil, vinegar, pepper, mustard 
and salt. Serve. Hay. 

TO BROIL ANY CAPPED FUNGUS. 

Select those that are spread open and keep the unopened for other 
styles of serving. Cut off the stems close to the tops. Baste well with 
melted butter and sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt. Heat the broiler 
very hot, lay the caps upon it with the gills up and broil over a clear fire, 
turning the broiler first on one side and then on the other. As soon as 
tender, which will be in about five minutes, open the broiler, remove 

643 



Recipes for Cooking 1 and Preparing for the Table 

the caps with care, and place on well-buttered slices of the toast which 
have been previously prepared. Pour over the whole a sauce made of 
drawn butter, or hot water thickened with flour to the consistency of 
cream. 

FRIED TOADSTOOLS. 

Take the caps only one pint well drained and carefully seasoned 
with one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful black pepper. Place 
in a pan with one ounce of butter (a lump the size of a small egg). 
Fry slowly for ten minutes. Add a little milk or cream thickened with 
flour. Serve on hot toast. 

TO COOK HYDNUM. 

In cooking Hydnei care must be taken to cook slowly and well. 

Use the tender parts only of stems and caps of the capped species, 
and soft, fresh parts of the maned species ; cut into small pieces of 
similar size, stew slowly in covered saucepan for from thirty to forty 
minutes, season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve. 

Or, after stewing for forty minutes as above, drain off the water, chop 
fine, make into croquettes or into pates. 

A HUNTER'S TOAST. 

Carry a vial of olive oil or a small can of butter, some pepper and 
salt mixed. An edible toadstool found, collect a few dry twigs, fire 
them. Split a green stick (sassafras, birch or spice-wood best) at one 
end ; put the toadstool in the cleft, hold it over the fire ; oil or butter, 
season. Eat from the stick. Mcllvaine. 

TO COOK HYPHOLOMAS. 

To STEW. Wash the caps, stew slowly in the water which the gills 
retain, for half an hour, keeping dish covered. Add plenty of butter, 
pepper and salt to taste, add cream or milk with a little thickening. 

The Hypholomas have a slightly bitter taste, of which most persons 
become very fond; if it is objectionable, add a small amount of lemon 
juice or sherry. Mcllvaine. 

H. PERPLEXUM. Put one dessertspoonful of vinegar in a quart of 
water. Soak the caps in this mixture twenty minutes. Then take them 
out and stew slowly for half an hour in a covered vessel, adding butter, 
pepper and salt to suit the taste. A small quantity of onion is thought 

644

by some to improve th flavor, and a thickening of flour and milk just 
before serving is an improvement. Prof. C. H. Peck. 

The above is given as recipe for cooking H. perplexum. It answers 
equally well for the many Hypholomas resembling it. Mcllvaine. 

To BXKE. Wash caps, remove stems, let drain for a few minutes, 
place gills upward in a pan, place on gills a small-sized lump of butter, 
season with pepper and salt, cover pan, and place in oven to bake for 
one-half hoar. Mcllvaine. 

TO COOK LACTARII. 

The rich juices of the Lactarii are best retained by baking. The spe- 
cies grow hard and granular if cooked rapidly. Baked they are excel- 
lent. This method is preferable to stewing, but no one will despise a 
properly made stew of them. 

TO COOK MARASMIUS OREADES. 

Remove the stems, wash the caps, place in a covered saucepan and 
simmer for thirty minutes, adding sufficient water to prevent scorching; 
add a little milk or cream, butter and season with salt and pepper to 
taste. 

Or, simply fry in butter, make a gravy and season to taste. 

To DRY. String the caps on threads and loop up in a dry place, and 
when thoroughly dry place in tight glass jars or tin cases. 

TO COOK THE MORELL MORCHELLA (from Persoon). 

1 . Having washed and cleansed them from the earth which is apt to 
collect between the plaits or hollows of the plant, dry thoroughly in a 
napkin and put them into a saucepan with pepper, salt and parsley, 
adding or not a piece of ham. Stew for an hour, pouring in occasionally 
a little broth to prevent burning. When sufficiently done, bind with 
the yolks of two or three eggs and serve on buttered toast. 

2. MORELLES A L'lTALIENNE. Having washed and dried, divide 
them across, put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion, chevril, 
burnet, tarragon, chives, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine oil. 
Stew till the juices run out, then thicken with a little flour; serve with 
bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon juice. 

645 



Recipes for Cooking 1 and Preparing for the Table 

PATES. 

The toadstools good for croquettes and pates are such as the Puff- 
balls, Lactarii, Gomphidius rhodoxanthus, Fistulina hepatica, Tricho- 
loma personatum and many others of the meaty kinds. Cut the toad- 
stools into small pieces, cook slowly until tender, adding butter; pepper 
and salt. Let them cook almost dry, then add cream or milk and thick- 
ening. Fill pastry shells and serve. Mel lvalue. 

A pretty effect is produced by dipping the rims of the shells in par- 
tially beaten white of egg, then in finely-chopped parsley before filling. 

TO COOK PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS. 

Remove tough stem-part, if any, and use only such parts of the 
plants as seem fresh and tender. 

To STEW. Cut in small pieces across the grain. Stew twenty minutes 
over slow fire with a little water. Add cream or milk with a little 
thickening; season with butter, pepper, salt. 

To FRY. Cut into pieces about the size of a medium-sized oyster, 
dip in egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot butter or oil, as oysters 
are fried. Mcllvaine. 

WITH CHEESE au gratin. Cut into medium-sized pieces. Stew 
slowly, rather dry, for fifteen minutes. Pour off liquor; save it. Place 
in baking dish (or in individual dishes, clam shells, etc.) a layer of 
ostreatus, buttering and seasoning each layer, sprinkle with bread 
crumbs and grated cheese and so on until dish is filled, placing cheese 
on top. Pour liquor over the dish. Place in slow oven and bake until 
well browned. 

This manner of cooking is a favorite. Any toadstool may be cooked 
in this way. Mcllvaine. 

Wash. Put them into a chafing dish with one ounce of butter to 
each half pound of plant. Sprinkle over half a teaspoonful of salt, 
cover the dish and cook slowly for five minutes. Beat the yolks of two 
eggs with one gill of good milk, lift the lid, add the mixture of eggs 
and milk; when smoking hot serve. Do not allow the mixture to boil 
or the eggs will become curdled. 

RECIPE No. 2. Wash. Dust with salt and pepper, dip in egg, 
then in bread crumbs and fry quickly in smoking hot olive oil. 

The following recipe was given me by a chef: 

"Put into the saucepan a tablespoonful of butter, add a clove of garlic, 

646 



Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

a thin slice of onion, stir until slightly brown and add a tablespoonful 
of flour. Mix carefully, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of beef extract 
dissolved in half a cup of water and the same quantity of cream. Bring 
to boiling point, add a tablespoonful of chopped carrot, a bay leaf, and 
a blade of mace. Stand the mixture on the back part of the stove 
where it will scarcely boil, for ten minutes. Strain and add half a 
pound of ostreatus. Cover and cook for ten minutes. Serve on toast." 

Mrs. S. T. Rorer. 

TO COOK PUFF-BALLS. 

To FRY. Remove the thin outer rind, slice, dip in egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry as egg-plant; serve without tomato sauce. 

To STEW. Cut in dice-shaped pieces, stew for fifteen minutes in a 
little water, pour off the water, dust with a little flour, add a small 
quantity of milk or cream, butter, pepper and salt and a little parsley. 
Stew slowly for five minutes. Serve. These also may be served in 
pates. When these are broken open they should be perfectly white in- 
side ; any stains or yellow part should be removed, otherwise they will 
be bitter. Mcllvaine. 

SALADS. Cut into strips, mingle with mustard and cress, or with 
blanched dandelions, scallions and hard-boiled egg, and dress as ordi- 
narily for a salad. Or, amalgamate with potato salad a 1'Allemande. 

Hay. 
TO COOK TRICHOLOMA PERSONATUM. 

To STEW. Wash and cut into small pieces. Stew for thirty minutes. 
Pour off the water, add milk slightly thickened, butter, pepper, salt and 
a little chopped parsley. Mcllvaine. 

TO STEW THE TOUGHER TOADSTOOLS. 

(Hydnaceje, Polyporaceae, Etc.) 

Cut into small pieces of even size. Soak for half an hour in tepid 
water. Remove from water, do not drain ; place in covered pan and 
simmer for forty minutes. Add proper proportion of thickened milk or 
cream, butter, pepper, salt. 

Those who like may add parsley or nutmeg, or beef gravy ; in fact, 
any flavoring. Mcllvaine. 

647 



Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

SALADS. 

Many species of fungi make good salads. The best of these are, 
Russulas when young, fresh and firm ; either sliced raw or stewed and 
drained ; Clitocybe multiceps stewed and drained ; Tricholoma per- 
sonatum, raw or stewed; Clitopilus prunulus, raw or stewed; Coprinus 
comatus, C. micaceus, atramentarius, raw; Clavaria, fresh, young, brit- 
tle, either raw or stewed; Fistulina hepatica, raw; any of the edible 
Polyporaceae, after stewing; any of the edible Hydnaceae after stewing ; 
the puff-balls, raw or stewed. Any favorite species will make a salad. 

After cooking allow to drain and cool ; then mix with mayonnaise 
dressing, or make a dressing to taste of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. 
Serve on lettuce. 

SOUP. 

Dame Nature never made a soup. Soup is a human invention of 
more or less distinctiveness. Usually it is a successful disguise or cov- 
ering of invisibility for something which furnishes the name. 

To make two quarts of a distinctly fungoid soup take one quart of 
any edible toadstools, carefully cleaned. Put in a well-covered boiler 
with three pints of water, and boil slowly for one hour. Rub the whole 
through a colander. Reject that which does not rub through readily. 
Add one-half pint of milk thickened with one tablespoonful of flour, 
one ounce of butter, a dessertspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Bring to a boil. Serve. 

Any chosen thing or things may be added to the above the toad- 
stools can not resent it. Mcllvaine. 

TOADSTOOLS WITH CHEESE. 

Several varieties of fungi are delicious when baked with a small quan- 
tity of cheese grated upon them ; notably Clitocybe multiceps, the 
Hypholomas, Armillarias, Pleurotus ulmarius and ostreatus, Lentinus 
lepideus and many Boleti. See recipe for baking. When several layers 
of plants compose the dish, cheese should be grated on each layer. 

Mcllvaine. 

BAKED TOADSTOOLS OF ANY GILLED KIND. 

Wash, place the caps in a tightly covered dish or pan after dipping 
them in bread crumbs. Lay them in layers, with a small piece of 
butter on each toadstool, as well as the proper amount of pepper and 

648 



Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the Table 

salt. Bake from twenty to forty minutes as suits the consistency of the 
species. Serve on toast. 

Or, the caps prepared as above, may be laid upon pieces of toast and 
placed in the pan. If this plan is adopted the lower pieces of toast 
become saturated with the liquor; therefore, in serving, cut from top to 
bottom of dish. 

See To Cook Clitocybe Multiceps. Mcllvaine. 

A CAMP BAKE. 

Cover the bottom of a tin plate with caps, spore surface up. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, place a bit of butter on each. Put another tin 
plate on top. Set on coals or a heated stone for fifteen minutes. Eat. 
No better baking will result in the best oven. Mcllvaine.

RAISING MUSHROOMS AT HOME 

By the courtesy of the publishers of The Woman's Home Companion, the author 
is permitted to republish his article, " Raising Mushrooms at Home," which appeared in 
the October, 1901, number of that excellent monthly encyclopedic in all home matters. 

'N October is the time to prepare the manure and beds 
for house-raising of mushrooms. During the warm 
months they can not be cultivated without trial of 
one's temper and test of one's taste. Any one hav- 
ing control of a cellar can raise a fine crop of expec- 
tations, and may raise a crop of mushrooms by either 
accident or experience. They are at all times the 
most contrary of growths, and require the nicest man- 
agement and much patience. The first thing to do is to select a well- 
ventilated spot away from direct drafts, where the temperature can be 
maintained at from fifty to sixty degrees and a moist atmosphere as- 
sured. Thoroughly cleanse the cellar and give it an entire covering of 
whitewash. 

Decide upon the size of bed desired. In width the bed should not 
exceed reaching distance* to its center when there is a pathway on each 
side of it, say six feet. The length of the bed should reach to its use- 
ful stopping-place. If the cellar has a portable heater in it, and is warm, 
the bed should be ten to twelve inches in depth ; if the heater is walled 
in, or the cellar is cool, the bed should be fifteen inches deep. 

Calculate how much fresh horse-manure, with the long straw only re- 
moved from it and that has not been rained upon, it will take to make 
a bed of desired dimensions solidly tramped. Get it, put it in a com- 
pact heap, and keep it covered from rain. It will heat rapidly and get 
smoking-hot, because a fermentation sets in which produces heat. If 
loam can be procured from a pasture or elsewhere it is well to add one- 
fifth (in bulk) of it to the manure, mixing it thoroughly. This addi- 
tion retards the fermentation and absorbs the ammonia a valuable fer- 

650 



Raising Mushrooms at Home 

tilizer which would otherwise be driven off by the heat. It also takes 
up any surplus of moisture. 

After the compact pile has been thus prepared it should stand two or 
three days, then be well forked over and again piled. This forking 
should be repeated from four to six times, at intervals of from two to 
four days, depending upon the use or not of loam, which affects the 
rapidity of heating. If loam is used the forking should be at longer in- 
tervals unless the heat becomes excessive. The manure will probably 
then be in good order to go into beds. It is upon proper, careful prep- 
aration of this medium that successful mushroom-raising greatly de- 
pends. All work and hopes are thrown away if the greatest care is not 
exercised. Just as it is folly to buy poor seeds upon which to expend 
costly labor, so it is folly to make beds of poorly prepared manure. 

The manure must neither contain too much nor too little water. By 




BRICK CUT FOR PLANTING. 



far the largest percentage of failures is due to too much. It rots the 
spawn vine (mycelium), and thus destroys the starting place of the 
fruit, or mushroom. The object in forking the manure so frequently 
is to sweeten it (as the operation is called) and to prevent overheating 
from fermentation. If it gets too hot it "burns" gets too dry. 
Molding, too, is avoided. Moldy manure will not produce. If, in 
forking over the pile, dry places are found, they should be sprinkled 
with water; if, when the fermentation grows less active, the manure is 
too wet, spread it out to air and dry somewhat. It is in good condi- 
tion and properly moist when tight squeezing will not press water from 
it. Far better that it should be too dry than too wet. The manure now 
ready should be moved to the cellar and made in,to beds while warm. 

Good ventilation is a necessity. Two thermometers are needed 
one to mark the temperature of the cellar, the other to place well and 
solidly down in the bed to record what it is doing in the heat way. It 
is probable that the mercury will rise slowly. It may go as high as 

651 



Raising Mushrooms at Home 

one hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and thirty degrees. Do 
not disturb the bed, however high it goes. When it falls to between 
ninety and eighty degrees plant the spawn. If possible, keep the tem- 
perature up for several days. It should then fall slowly to sixty 
degrees, but go down no farther. Never plant on a rising temperature. 

Mushroom-spawn comes in brick-shaped blocks. They can be pur- 
chased, of good quality, from any reliable seedsman. These blocks 
are made of a mixture of dungs, through which the mycelium, or vine, 
from which mushrooms grow, has been run. After this mixture is filled 
with the vine (badly named spawn) it is pressed into blocks and dried. 
It should be kept dry until used. Spawning a bed is nothing more 
than placing cuttings of this exceedingly fine vine under the influence 
of moisture and heat in a soil fitted for its growth (such as the bed 
should be), then inducing it to run and fruit. Spawn is originally made 
to grow by planting the seed of mushrooms in specially prepared dungs 
and germinating them. The mycelium, or vine, coming from this 
germination is called "virgin spawn," and is perpetuated in its growth 
by running (training) it through manures, pieces of which form the 
spawn of commerce. 

With a sharp hatchet cut the bricks into twelve pieces of equal size ; 
a fine, clean meat-saw may be used, as it reduces breakage. With the 
hand make holes in the bed ten inches apart each way. These holes 
must be so deep that when the lumps of spawn are thrust firmly down 
into them the top of the lumps will be not less than one inch or more 
than two inches below the surface of the bed. Cover the lumps firmly. 
Have the surface of the bed as even as possible. Without having to go 
very far into the cold region of mathematics, the number of bricks of 
spawn needed is easily figured. Ascertain the number of holes, ten 
inches apart, that can be made in the bed. Divide this number by 
twelve, and lo ! you have it. 

After the bed is spawned it is well to lay a double thickness of news- 
papers over it, putting a few plastering-laths or light sticks upon them 
to keep them in place. This is to keep the heat in the bed, as it is 
desirable that the temperature should not run down too rapidly. It 
should be two weeks falling to sixty degrees. 

Ten days after spawning, if the heat of the bed has gone down to 
sixty-five or sixty degrees, cover the bed with two inches of loam and 

652 



Raising Mushrooms at Home 

pat it solid with spade or board. The bed should not be covered with 
loam when the temperature is too high. Removing the papers will 
allow the heat to escape. At the time of covering with loam the spawn 
should have begun to spread. It will show plainly in the manure close 
to the lumps of spawn. Its odor is unmistakable, being musky, spicy, 
much like mushrooms, but stronger. Care should be taken not to dis- 
turb the new mycelium, as all breakage of the fine, web-like threads 
lessens its product. The mycelium should start and grow quickly up to 
the time of covering with loam. After that a slow increase is best. To 
effect this the surrounding outside temperature should be from fifty- 
seven to sixty-two degrees. Ventilation should be upward and good, 
but not directly upon the bed. 

The mycelium will now run and completely fill the bed. Minute 
white nodules will appear upon the threads of it ; these are the beginnings 
of the mushrooms to come. In from seven to eight weeks after spawn- 
ing tiny button mushrooms should appear on top of the bed. If the 
cellar has been cool it may be a few days longer. Mr. Falconer says, 
"If the temperature of the bed falls below fifty-seven degrees, and the 
atmospheric temperature below forty-five degrees, the beds should be 
covered with matting or other material." Newspapers will do. Upon 
the appearance of the mushrooms is the time a moist atmosphere is 
needed. This is obtained by sprinkling the walks and cellar well with 
warm water. This moisture should be kept up all the while the crop is 
growing. Unless the fruiting beds show a marked dryness they should 
not be watered. If watering is required, do it very carefully with a 
fine rose or syringe. Have the pure water at ninety degrees, and do 
not more than moisten the loam covering. Never let the water settle 
in pools or wash the surface. 

After the bed is in bearing the addition of strong, liquid manure 
plentifully applied between the bunches (never on them) will add to 
their weight and size. It should be done with a long spout without 
rose. A sprinkling of salt on bare places is beneficial. 

GATHERING THE CROP. 

The mushrooms will now show in various sizes, from pin-head to 
large, full-grown specimens, singly and in dense clusters. As fast as 
they reach the desired size twist them from their sockets. Do not cut 
or pull them. Keep the gills downward, to prevent dirt getting in them.

Raising Mushrooms at Home 

Take care not to disturb those left in the beds more than is necessary. 
It is unnecessary to add, cook them, but it is very necessary to tell how, 
because many excellent cooks commit the outrageous sacrilege of peel- 
ing mushrooms. A large amount of the flavor and deliciousness of a 
mushroom is in the skin as it is in the apple. One might just as well 
peel a strawberry. First, always holding the plant gills downward and 
not over others, cut away the extreme base of the stem and brush off 
any adhering dirt. If the cap shows much scruff, rub it off with a piece 
of coarse flannel or cloth. Throw the mushrooms thus cleaned into cold

water; they will float. Run the fingers through them several times, 
then lift them to a fresh pan of water, wash them and place them, 
gills downward, on a cloth to drain, or put them in a colander. Then 
cook them to taste. Here, again, sacrilege is frequent. Many foods 
are simply mediums for added flavors. Not so the mushroom ; it 
has a decided, exquisite flavor of its own. It should not be made 
in cooking to taste like something else. Put the mushrooms in a 
stew-pan with a little water; cover them, and stew slowly for twenty 
minutes, adding butter, salt and pepper to taste. Cream or milk may 
be added. Another very good vy is to butter well a medium-hot

pan; cut the mushrooms into equal-sized pieces, put them in it, cover, 
and fry. Stir them from time to time, and when quite done season with 
salt and pepper. A good gravy is made for them by using water, milk 
or cream. Now if you must have a meat of some sort, put the meat on 
one dish and the mushrooms on another. By doing this you spoil the 
taste of neither. 

Beds will continue to produce for several weeks if properly cared for. 
As soon as they cease bearing remove them, clean up, white-wash, coal- 
oil every inch of wood, salt the floor, and be ready to try again. After 
the amateur has his or her hand in, the bed area can be largely increased 
by building rough berths, one above the other, in which beds can be 
made. An important bit of advice is: Start in a small way. Do not 
expend any more money than you can afford to lose.

ONE THOUSAND AMERICAN FUNGI

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION 

THE first edition of "One Thousand American Fungi" so fully 
embodied the species known to be edible, that the field for fresh inves- 
tigation has been confined principally to newly discovered species. In 
the eighteen months elapsing since the publication of the first edition, 
Professor Charles H. Peck the American authority upon fungi has 
reported several. These, with his descriptions, are named in the sup- 
plement. 

The many requests made of the author for information upon the 
raising of mushrooms show a prevalent interest in the industry. What 
he knows is stated herein; what he does not know, and what is not 
known upon the subject, would furnish trie matter for a volume. 

Interest in the study of fungi is well established and is rapidly in- 
creasing. This department of botany has been made a specialty in 
many colleges and schools. Its importance is everywhere recognized. 

The author and publishers feel a just pride in the success of "One 
Thousand American Fungi." The prompt sale of the first edition, and 
immediate demand for the second, warrant it. Their thanks are due to 
the many who have kindly interested themselves in obtaining subscrip- 
tions to the author's edition.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION 

In preparing the third edition of this volume for publication, the 
editor has left almost intact the valuable work of the late Dr. Mcllvaine. 
The changes to be noted in the revision are more matters of re-arrange- 
ment than alterations of the original text. 

It is gratifying to record the fact that while a large amount of addi- 
tional literature has been published concerning many of the species rep- 
sented in the first and second editions, there appears none that essentially 
affects the value of the observations there recorded. 

Of the great number of new species of fungi discovered since the last 
edition, the most interesting, as pertaining to the scope of this work, are 
those published by Professor Chas. H. Peck in the Reports of the New 
York State Museum. From these, thirty or more have been included as 
a supplement to this edition. These have been selected as most likely to 
be found by those using this work. In re-grouping Prof. Peck's illus- 
trations, to adapt them to the cut form in this book, care has been taken 
to represent, as fully as possible, effects difficult to secure where color 
can not be employed. The natural size of the plants is indicated on 
each cut, and the spores are represented magnified 400 diameters. 
Prof. Peck's wording is scrupulously transcribed in all descriptive mat- 
ter preceding the occurrence of his name in italics.

Amanita calyptrata albescens Pk. Rep., 1899: 840. Sandy soil, 
Gansevoort, Saratoga county, New York. July. Our specimens differ 
from the typical form of the species (A. calyptrata Pk. see page 26) in 
being wholly white or whitish. The 
type (A. calyptrata) which was sent 
from Oregon, has the pileus yellow 
or yellowish brown, and the lamellae 
yellowish white, both having a slight 
tinge of green. The peculiar thick, 
felty, white fragment of the volva 
that adheres to and covers the central 
part of the pileus forms a characteris- 
tic feature of the species and is sug- 
gestive of its name. This, together 
with the thick remains of it at the base 
of the stem, and the more strongly 
striate margin of the pileus, easily 
distinguishes the species from A. 
spreta, to which it is closely allied. 
Because of its different color I have 
considered our plant a variety of the 
species and named it variety albescens. 

The Oregon plant (A. calyptrata) 
is known to be edible, but as only two specimens of the variety were 
found, no opportunity for testing its edible quality was given. Peck. 

Amanita Frostiana pallidipes Pk. Rep., 1899: 855. The typical 
form of this species, which is common in our cool northern woods, has 
the pileus and annulus, and usually the stem also, of a yellow color, 
that of the pileus sometimes verging to orange. But in warmer and 
more open or bushy places forms occur in which the whole plant is 
whitish, but in other respects has the characters of the species. Some-

times the pileus is pale-yellow and the stem and annulus white. The 
warts are soft and flocculent, are sometimes numerous and persistent, 
and again are few or wanting. The form with yellow stem and annulus 
and yellow or orange pileus may be considered the typical form of the' 
species, but forms having the stem and annulus pale or white may be 
designated as variety pallidipes. Peck. 

For illustration of the species, A. Frostiana, from which this variety 
differs as above described, see plate VI, fig. 5. 

Undoubtedly POISONOUS. Mcllvaine. 

Amanita glabriceps Pk. Rep., 1908: 18. Pileus thin, ovate or 
oval becoming broadly convex or centrally depressed, glabrous, rarely 
adorned when young with a few patches of the ruptured volva, viscid 

when moist, often finely striate on the 
margin, white or yellowish white, some- 
times slightly brownish in the center. 
Flesh white under the separable cuticle. 
Lamellae thin, crowded, free, unequal, 
white. Stem long, slender, stuffed, glab- 
rous or floccose-squamulose, bulbous, white, 
the thin, flabby annulus sometimes rup- 
tured and partly adhering to the margin 
of the pileus ; sometimes disappearing with 
age. Bulb margined by the remains of the 
definitely circumcissile volva. Spores glo-

This species is closely related to Aman- 
ita pJialloides Fr. from which it is separat- 
ed by its more slender habit, its longer 
slender stem with a webby pith and a 
more narrow bulb margined by the remains of the more definitely cir- 
cumcissile volva. Amanita phalloides striatula Pk. is a small variety of 
this species rather than of A. phalloides. Peck.

Supplement 



(Plate CLXXXVIII.) 



This variety differs from the type (see Amanitopsis volvata, page 31) 
in its purer white glabrous pileus, its long stem and in having the bulb 
deeply buried in the ground. The remains of the ruptured volva are 
generally more closely pressed about the base of the stem than in the 
species, in which the bulb is above or just at the surface of the ground. 
In both forms the lamellae change color in drying, becoming much 
darker than when fresh. The stem is from four to six inches long. 
Sometimes the pileus is adorned by one or two small fragments of the 
volva which adhere to it. Peck. 

Great care should be taken in establishing the true specific status of 
the specimens if inclined to test the edibility of this variety. Should 
there be the least semblance of an annulus in any specimen, beware! 

Lepiota clypeolaria (Bull.) Fr. Pk. Rep., 1900: 173. Shield Lep- 
iota. ( PI. CLXXXVIII. ) Pileus thin, soft, convex or subcampanulate, 
becoming nearly plane, obtuse or umbonate, squamose, whitish or yel- 
lowish, the center or umbo smooth, yellow- 
ish or brownish, the margin often appen- 
diculate with fragments of the veil. Flesh 
white. Lamellae thin, close, free, white. 
Stem slender, equal or slightly tapering 
upward, hollow, fragile, pallid, adorned 
with soft, loose, white or yellowish floccose 
scales or filaments. Spores oblong or sub- 
fusiform, 12 2O/A long, 6 8/>. broad. 

The cap of the shield lepiota is at first 
somewhat ovate or bell-shaped, but with 
advancing age it becomes convex above 
or nearly flat. It is white or whitish, but 
spotted with numerous small scales of a 
)-ellowish or brownish-yellow color. These 
scales are the result of the breaking up of 
the thin cuticle that covers the very young 

* & Vsnat. 

plant, and they have the same color as it. 
A small space in the center is brown or yellowish brown, or darker than 
the rest of the cap, because the cuticle covering it remains unbroken 
and retains its color. The center in some specimens is more prominent 
than in others, giving what is called an umbonate cap. The margin of

(Plate CLXXXIX.) 



the cap is sometimes shaggy, especially in young plants, by the adher- 
ing fragments of the whitish veil. 

The gills are thin, closely placed side by side and rounded at the 
end next the stem, but they are not attached to the stem. They are 
white. The stem is rather long and slender, fragile and adorned with 
loose, soft fibrils or flocculent, cottony tufts, which give it a somewhat 
shaggy appearance, but it becomes smoother as the plant grows older. 

The cap is usually from 12.5 inches broad, and the stem from 1.53 
inches long and 1.53 l mes thick. The plants grow in woods, specially in 
hilly and mountainous regions, and are generally solitary or few in a place, 
but in favorable seasons they are of frequent occurrence and may be found 
from July to October. Though small and thin, the caps are well-flavored 
and make a desirable dish. L. metulaespora B. and Br. scarcely differs 
from this species, except in the striate margin of its cap. Peck. 

Tricholoma subacutum Pk. Rep., 1888: 112. Pileus at first ovate 
or broadly conical, then convex and subacutely umbonate, dry, silky 
and obscurely virgate with minute innate fibrils, whitish tinged with 

smoky-brown or bluish-gray, darker 
on the umbo. Flesh white, taste acrid 
or peppery. Lamellae rather close, 
slightly adnexed, white. Stem equal, 
stuffed or hollow, silky -fibrillose, 
white. Spores broadly elliptical or 
subglobose, .00025 to .0003 inch long, 
.0002 to .00025 broad. 

Pileus 1.5 to 3 inches broad; stem 
2 to 4 inches long, 3-6 lines thick. 

Woods and groves. North Elba, 
Essex county, New York. Septem- 
ber. 

The species is perhaps too closely 
related to T. virgatum, but it is sep- 
arable by its prominent subacute 
umbo, paler pileus, hollow stem and 
hot or peppery taste. The cuticule 
is separable from the pileus. Peck.

and includes it under his rubric of " Edible Fungi." He remarks that 
the flesh has no decided odor and that it is sometimes acrid and some- 
times mild. 

Tricholoma unifactum Pk. Rep., 1905 : 36. Pileus fleshy but thin, 
convex, often irregular, sometimes eccentric from its crowded mode of 
growth, whitish. Flesh whitish, taste mild. Lamellae thin, narrow, 
close, rounded behind, slightly ad- 
nexed, sometimes forked near the 
base, white. Stem equal or thicker 
at the base, solid, fibrous, white, 
united at the base in a large fleshy 
mass. Spores white, subglobose, 
.00016 to .0002 of an inch broad. 

Pileus 12 inches broad ; stem 
12 inches long, 35 lines thick. 

Under hemlock trees. Horicon, 
Warren county, New York. July. 

The united tricholoma belongs to 
the section Guttata and is closely 
related to the northern tricholoma 
(Tric/wloma boreale} and to the 
whitish tricholoma (Tricholoma al- 
belluin}. From the former it is 
separated by its different color, mode 
of growth and lack of odor ; and 
from the latter by its color, the ab- y 2nat 
sence of spots on the cap and by its 
smaller subglobose spores. The stem and gills are white, the cap is; 
nearly so. It has a watery white appearance when moist. The plants 
grow in clusters, several stems arising from a large whitish fleshy mass, 
by which character it is at once distinguished from all our other species 
of Tricholoma. 

The taste is mild and there is no decided odor. The flesh is tender 
and of excellent flavor when properly cooked. Peck. 

Clitocybe adirondackensis Pk. Rep., 1900: 174. Adirondack 
Clitocybe. Pileus thin, convex or nearly plane and umbilicate, or

centrally depressed and funnel-form, glabrous, moist, white or pale tan 
color. (Appearing like Clitocybe infundibuliformis membranacea Fr.) 
Flesh white. Lamellae thin, narrow, close, very decurrent, white. Stem 

nearly equal, glabrous, stuffed or hollow, 
colored like the pileus. Spores subglo- 
bose or broadly elliptic, 4-5^ long, 3-41* 
broad. 

The Adirondack clitocybe is common 
in the northern forests of the state, but 
is not limited to them. Its cap is thin, 
and soon becomes nearly flat with a de- 
curved margin and a central depression 
or umbilicus; or very concave by the 
elevation of the margin, and then it re- 
sembles a wineglass in shape. Its mar- 
gin is sometimes wavy or irregular. In 
color it varies from white to a very pale 
red or tan color. White specimens some- 
times have the center slightly darker 
than the rest. 

The gills are very narrow, being scarcely broader than the thickness 
of the flesh of the cap. They are closely placed, white and decurrent. 
The stem is nearly cylindric, smooth and stuffed or hollow. It is col- 
ored like the cap. Often there is a white tomentum or cottony sub- 
stance at its base. 

The cap varies in size and is 1-2 inches broad; the stem 1.5-3 inches 
long and 1-2 lines thick. It may be found from July to October. Its 
flavor is suggestive of that of the common mushroom. Peck. 
Agaricus adirondackensis Pk. Rep., 1908: 77 

Clitocybe maculosa Pk. Rep., 1900: 174. Spotted Clitocybe. Pileus

with numerous small round spots, yellowish-white, the young margin 
involute and minutely downy. Flesh white, taste mild. Lamellae nar- 
row, close, very decurrent, whitish or slightly yellowish, some of them 
forked. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, glabrous or sparingly 
fibrillose, stuffed, sometimes becoming hollow, whitish. Spores subglo- 
bose or orbicular, 4-5^ broad.

Supplement 



(Plate CXCII.) 



The peculiar mark by which the spotted clitocybe may be distin- 
guished consists in the small round definite spots in the central part of 
the cap. They have a slightly darker or watery or yellowish color and 
appear as if depressed below the rest of the 
surface. The cap is smooth and whitish or 
yellowish white and is generally depressed 
in the center and decurved on the margin. 
The margin is usually adorned with slight, 
short radiating ridges. The flesh is white 
and the taste mild. 

Agaricus maculosus Pk. Rep., 1908 : 78. 

The gills are closely placed side by side,

pears in August and September. I 
have found it in the Adirondack for- 
ests only. Its range is probably north- 
ward, and its rarity detracts from its 
importance as an edible species. Peck.

interspaces venose, milk white, mild. 
Stem short, equal or tapering down-

The distant-gilled Lactarius is sim- 
ilar to the orange Lactarius in color, 
but in other respects it is quite dis- 
tinct. The short stem, widely sepa- 
rated gills and pruinose surface of the 
cap are distinctive features. The cap 
is broadly convex and often has a 
small central depression or umbilicus. 
In some cases it becomes nearly plane 
or even slightly funnel-shape by the 

spreading or elevation of the margin. The surface, specially in young 
and in well-developed specimens, has a soft pruinose or almost velvety 
appearance to the naked eye, and when viewed through a magnifying 
glass it is seen to be covered with minute persistent granules. The sur- 
face is sometimes wrinkled and frequently it cracks in such a way as to 
form small angular or irregular areas. The color is a peculiar one, vary-

mg somewhat in shade, but with tawny hues prevailing. It has been 
described as yellowish tawny, and brownish orange. The flesh is white 
or whitish and has a mild taste. 

The gills are wide apart, somewhat arched in specimens having a con- 
vex cap and slightly decurrent in those with fully expanded or centrally 
depressed caps. Their color is white or creamy yellow and in old and 
dried specimens they have a white pruinosity as if frosted by the spores. 
The milk is white and mild. 

The stem is short, rarely more than an inch long, and is cylindric or 
tapering downward. It is solid and colored and clothed like the cap. 

The cap is I to 4 in. broad; the stem is usually about I in. long, 4 
to 8 lines thick. It is found in thin woods, bushy places and pastures 
from July to September. It is similar to the orange Lactarius, L. vol- 
emus, in its edible qualities. Peck, Rep. 1878: 678. 

Lactarius subpurpureus Pk. Rep., 1875: 43. In his report of 
1900, page 176, Prof. Peck redescribes the species and adds interesting 
notes concerning its forms and color. 
Remarking upon its relationship, habitat 
and edibility, he says: "This lactarius 
is distinguished from all our other spe- 
cies by the dark red milk that issues 
from wounds of the flesh or gills. It 
belongs to the same group of species as 
L. deliciosus, L. indigo and L. cJieli- 
doninm. It is also allied to the Euro- 
pean L. sanguifluus. The plants grow 
in woods and swamps among mosses and 
fallen leaves, and occur from July to 
October. When fresh their taste is 
slightly acrid, but when they are cooked 
it is scarcely inferior to that of L . delici- 
osus. Peck. 

I had not seen this species when the 
first edition of this work went to press, 
consequently could not report its edible 

qualities. The favorable testing by Professor Peck 'adds weight to the 
opinion I have frequently expressed, that acridity of species when

Eussula abietina Pk. Rep., 1900: 180. Fir Tree Russula. Pileus 
thin, fragile, convex, becoming nearly plane or slightly depressed in 
the center, viscid when moist, the viscid pellicle separable, tuberculate 

striate on the margin. Flesh white, 
taste mild. Lamellae subdistant, ven- 
tricose, narrowed toward the stem, 
rounded behind and nearly free, whit- 
ish, becoming pale yellow, the inter- 
spaces venose. Stem equal or taper- 
ing toward the top, stuffed or hollow, 
white. Spores bright yellowish och- 
raceous, subglobose, rough, 8-io/u. 
broad. 

The fir tree russula is closely related 
to the youthful russula, R. pnellaris 
Fr., from which it is separated by the 
viscid cap, the gills rather widely 
separated from each other and nearly 
free, the stem never yellowish nor 
becoming yellow where wounded, and 

the spores having an ochraceous hue. They are much brighter and 
more highly colored in the mass than the mature gills. The cap 
varies much in color, but the center is generally darker than the rest. 
It may be dull purple or greenish purple with a brownish or blackish 
center, or sometimes with an olive green center, or it may be olive green 
or smoky green with a brownish center. Olive green and purplish hues 
of various shades are variously combined, but sometimes the margin is 
grayish and the center olive green. The flesh is white and its taste 
mild. The gills are white when young, or barely tinged with yellow, 
but they become pale yellow with age. They are neither crowded nor 
widely attached to the stem, and are connected with each other by cross 
veins, which can be seen at the bottom of the interspaces. The stems 
are rather slender, soft or spongy, sometimes becoming hollow and oc- 
casionally tapering 'upward. They are very constantly and persistently 
white. The cap is 1-2.5 inches broad, the stem 1-2.5 inches long,

In his Report for 1902, page 45, 
Prof. Peck redescribes the species 
with some slight changes and addi- 
tions due to later accessions of ma- 
terial, and adds: 

The crusted russula is closely re- 
lated to the greenish russula (R. vir- 

escens}, and the cracked russula {R. cutefracta). From the former it 
differs in its slightly viscid cap, of which the cuticle cracks and forms 
small, crust-like patches or scales on the margin, but usually remains 
entire in the center. From the latter it is distinct by the absence of 
any red or purplish tints in the flesh and the stem. Even in purplish 
specimens the flesh and stem are wholly white. 

The cap is very convex or almost hemispheric when young, nearly 
plane or centrally depressed when mature. The surface cracks toward 
the margin as in R. cutefracta, while the center nearly always remains

entire. These surface chinks form small areolae or scales, which appear 
like fragments of a crustaceous cuticle. 

The color varies greatly. It may be straw-yellow, pale ochraceous, 
brownish ochraceous, greenish with a yellowish ochraceous center or a 
dull brownish purple. The center is sometimes paler, sometimes darker 
than the margin. The gills are white, narrowed toward the stem and 
nearly free. They are sometimes forked, especially near the stem, and 
intervening short ones occur near the margin. They are white and un- 
changeable. The stem is also white. This mushroom is more common 
with us than the greenish russula, which it resembles in size and flavor. 

Edible. The flesh is white and the taste mild or sometimes slightly 
and tardily acrid. The acridity if present is destroyed by cooking. Peck. 

Russula rugulosa Pk. Rep., 1900: 179. Rugulose Russula. Pileus 
rather thin, fragile, convex, becoming nearly plane or centrally depressed, 
viscid when moist, roughened or uneven with small tubercles and rugae, 

even on the margin when young, becoming 
tuberculate striate with age, the viscid pellicle 
separable on the margin. Flesh white, reddish 
under the cuticle, taste tardily acrid . Lamellae 
rather close, adnate or slightly rounded be- 
hind, white. Stem nearly equal, spongy 
within, white. Spores white, rough, sub- 
globose, 8 IO/A broad, shining in trans- 
mitted light. 

The rugulose russula is closely related to 
the emetic russula, but differs from it in the 
uneven or rugulose surface of the cap, in the 
tardily acrid taste and in its closer adnate 
gills. Its cap is red, varying from pale-red 
to dark-red, viscid when moist, even on the 
margin when young, but somewhat tuber- 
culate and striate when old. Its surface is 
roughened by minute tubercles or pimples, 

which sometimes appear to run together and form short ridges. These 
are sometimes absent from the center of the cap. The viscid cuticle 
easily peels from the margin of the cap, but not from the center. The 
flesh is white, except just under the cuticle, where it is reddish. It is

soft and fragile, and its taste is slowly and much less sharply acrid than 
in the emetic russula. Its gills are closely placed, attached to the stem 
and persistently white. The stem is brittle, soft and spongy within, 
smooth and white. The cap is 24 inches broad, the stem 23 inches 
long, 4-8 lines thick. 

It grows in woods among mosses and fallen leaves or on the bare 
ground, and appears in August and September. It is an inhabitant of 
the Adirondack forests. Its slightly acrid flavor is destroyed in cook- 
ing, and k affords a harmless, tender and agreeable food. Peck. 

llussula variata Banning, in Pk. Rep., 1905 : 41. PileilS firm, con-

The variable russula is appro- 
priately named, for its caps are 
very variable in color. They are 
dark purple or reddish purple 
variously intermingled or variegated with green, or wholly pale green. 
The viscid pellicle is closely attached to the cap in the center, but it is 
separable on the margin. In drying it sometimes forms obscure spots. 
Notwithstanding the variations in the color of the caps, the species is 
easily recognized, for the gills are very constant in their characters. 
Their narrowness, closeness and numerous bifurcations are peculiar and 
very constant features. They are sometimes slightly decurrent, especi-

ally in mature specimens, whose upcurved margin gives the cap a more 
or less funnel shape. The stem is white and solid, or sometimes with 
central cavities arranged one above another. It belongs to the section 
Furcatae, as shown by the even margin of the cap and the gills tapering 
toward each end. 

The acrid taste of the fresh cap is destroyed in cooking, and the 
flavor is then very good. Peck. 

Cantharellus cinnabarinus Schw., Pk. Rep., 1898: 679. Cin- 
nabar Chantarelle. (Plate CC.) Pileus firm, convex or slightly de- 
pressed in the center, often irregular with a wavy or lobed margin, 

glabrous, cinnabar red. Flesh white. 
LamellSB narrow, distant, branched, 
decurrent, red. Steill equal or ta- 
pering downward, glabrous, solid or 
stuffed, red. Spores elliptic, S-IO/A 
long, 4-5/u. broad. 

The cinnabar Chantarelle is readily 
recognized by its color. It is exter- 
nally red in all its parts, the interior 
only being white. It is a small spe- 
cies, but often quite irregular in 
shape. Small specimens are more 
likely to be regular than large ones. 
Sometimes the cap is more fully 
developed on one side than on the 
other. This makes the stem eccen- 
tric or in some cases almost lateral. 
The color is quite constant, but in 
some instances it is paler and ap- 
proaches a pinkish hue. It is apt 
to fade or even disappear in dried 
specimens. The gills are blunt on 

the edge as in other species of this genus. They are forked or branched, 
narrow and decurrent. 

The stem is small, smooth and usually rather short. It is generally 
solid, but in the original description it is characterized as stuffed. The 
cap is 8 to 1 8 lines broad, the stem 6 to 12 lines long and I to 3 broad.

It grows gregariously in thin woods and open places, and may be found 
from July to September. It sometimes occurs in great abundance, 
which adds to its importance as an edible species. The fresh plant has 
a tardily and slightly acrid flavor, but this disappears in cooking. In 
Epicrisis, Fries referred this species to the genus Hygrophorus, and in 
Sylloge also it is placed in that genus, but it is a true Cantharellus and

This dichotomous chantarelle is a small but 
common species in our hilly and mountainous 
districts. It grows in woods among mosses or 
in pastures and bushy places among grasses 
and fallen leaves. It is gregarious and ap- 
pears from July to September. 

The cap is generally broadly convex with 
decurved margin, but sometimes it becomes centrally depressed by the 
elevation of the margin. The umbo is small and usually acute, or 
papillalike, but it is often entirely absent. The margin is involute and 
minutely flocculent or downy when young, but it soon becomes naked. 
The surface is smooth or obscurely silky and occasionally becomes min- 
utely rimose areolate. The color is very variable and may be grayish 
white, grayish brown, yellowish brown, blackish brown or bluish gray. 
The gills are narrow, thin, close, decurrent and 1-3 times forked. They 
are white or whitish sometimes tinged with yellow. In moist weather 
wounds on gills and stem sometimes become reddish. The stem is equal

in diameter or slightly tapering upward. It is glabrous or slightly 
fibrillose, solid, whitish, or pallid, or colored like the pileus, and when 
growing among mosses is clothed below with a soft, dense, white to- 
mentum, which binds it so closely to the mosses that it is difficult to take 
a specimen without breaking the stem unless the mosses are taken with it. 

It is related so closely to CantJiarcllus umbonatns that it has sometimes 
been regarded as a variety of it or has even been confused with it, but 
the gills of that species are described as straight, and in our plant they 
are constantly repeatedly forked as in C. aurantiacus and C ' . albidus. 
The umbo in our plant is small and pointed and often wholly wanting, 
but in C. umbonatns it is represented as broad and blunt. Because of 
these discrepancies it seems best to keep our plant distinct. 

As an edible mushroom it is not as tender as some nor as highly 
flavored, but it is satisfactory and enjoyable. Peck.

Plants of this genus often prove poisonous, and should not be at- 
tempted as edible except by those who are able to carefully test them. 

Oortinarius COrmgatus Pk. Rep., 1898: 674. Corrugated Cortin-

like the pileus. Spores broadly elliptical, rough, ii-i6/u, long, 8-io/x 
broad. 

The corrugated Cortinarious is a well-marked and easily-recognized 

species, quite distinct from its allies. 
Although the color of the pileus is vari- 
able, its viscid, corrugated surface and 
the viscid bulb of the stem afford dis- 
tinctive and easily-recognized charact- 
ers. Sometimes the corrugations or 
wrinkles anastomose with each other in 
such a way as to give a reticulated ap- 
pearance. The color varies from yellow 
to reddish tawny or reddish ochraceous. 
The margin in young plants is incurved. 
There is a variety in which the cap is 
adorned with darker colored spots or 
scales. This bears the name, variety 
subsquamosus. In all other respects it 
is like the species. 

The gills are closely placed side by 
side. They are at first of a pale hue, 
but assume a darker and more definite 
tawny color with age. They are usually 
minutely uneven or eroded on the edge 
and transversely striate on the sides. They are slightly narrowed toward 
the stem. 

The stem is generally a little longer than the width of the cap. It is 
commonly smooth, but sometimes sprinkled near the top with minute 
yellowish particles and adorned below with a few fibrils. It is hollow 
and has a distinct viscid bulbous base, the viscidity of which is a pecu- 
liar feature. This bulb in the very young plant is even broader than 
the young cap, that at this stage of development appears to rest upon 
it. The color of the bulb is usually like that of the cap, but the stem 
is commonly paler than either. 

The cap is 2 to 4 inches broad ; the stem 3 to 5 inches long, 3 to 8 lines 
thick. The plants are gregarious in woods and bushy places, and may 
be found from June to September. It sometimes grows in considerable 
abundance, and as an edible species it is not to be despised. Peck.

The margin of the pileus is generally

ference between the margin and the rest 
of the pileus is not clearly shown in the 
dried specimens. The species belongs 
to the section Myxacium. Peck. 

As to edible qualities we have no 
available report concerning this species. 
None in this genus has been found to be 
harmful, even though several are bitter and many unpleasant. The flesh 
is apt to be dry and of a strong woody flavor, and cooking does not 
dissipate either of these characteristics. 

Agaricus abruptibulbus Pk. Rep., 1908: 60. (A. silvicola Vitt., 
A. arvensis var. abruptus Pk). (Plate CCVII.) Agaricus abruptns 
Pk. is described on page 343 as A. silvicola Vitt. It is very common 
in the woods of West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In the 
summer of 1901 I found it in Rockingham county, North Carolina. 
The probabilities are that its spread is extensive. 

Being the wood cousin of the field mushroom (A. campester) it de- 
serves more than ordinary attention. It is found during months which 
do not favor the growth of the mushroom. It is equally good, though 
not so fleshy. It gives the true mushroom flavor to less flavored edible 
species when cooked with them. 

When seen at a distance, growing in the woods, it has the appearance 
of an Amanita, but the color of the gills, which are never white after the 
cap opens and become as the spores ripen a blackish brown, distin- 
guishes it at once. Neither has it a volva. 

The excellent photograph of the species, taken by the late Dr. J. R. 
Weist, Richmond, Ind., presents a life-like picture of it. Mcllvaine.

The cap is generally some shade of 
brown, but sometimes when young it

fibrils or scales, though these sometimes become obscure or disappear 
with age. When young it is hemispheric or very convex, but it soon 
becomes broadly convex or nearly flat, with the center either slightly 
depressed or somewhat prominent. The flesh is generally whitish or 
grayish white when first exposed to the air. It assumes the red color 
rather slowly and after a time loses it again. 

The gills are pink or rarely whitish when young, but become brown

tapering upward, sometimes slightly thickened or bulbous at the base, 
sometimes not. It is hollow, but the cavity small, at first fibrillose and 
more or less adorned with floccose scales toward the base, but these 
generally disappear with age, and the primary white color of the stem 
is 'apt to become darker with age. The collar is membranaceous and

Agaricus Morgan! Pk. Bot. Gaz., 4: 137. The majority of my- 
cophagists are immune to the poison of this species. (See page 738.) 
Yet many cases of severe, but not fatal poisoning by ; t came within the 
writer's knowledge during the season of 1900-1901. 

A valuable report is contained in a letter from George B. Clementson, 
attorney, Lancaster, Wis. : 

" * * Agaricus Morgani has grown in this locality this season in 

unusual abundance. While I was absent last week, my father picked a 
number, mistaking them for L. procera, and my mother, in preparing 
them for the table, ate a small piece of the cap of one a piece, she 
assures me, no larger than a hickory nut. About two hours afterward 
and shortly after dinner (at which the mushrooms were not served, and 
at which nothing indigestible was eaten) she experienced a peculiar 
numbness and nausea, with constriction of the throat. Vomiting set in 
within half an hour and was excessive, lasting several hours and giving 
no relief. She was very greatly weakened and thought herself dying, 
being so reduced at one time that she was unable to see. Purging set 
in not long after the vomiting. The constriction of the throat did not 
disappear until after the vomiting stopped. 

"Whisky and nitroglycerine (by the stomach) were given to keep up 
the heart's action. 

"It seems probable that the poison itself did not directly affect the 
heart, but that the alarming weakness was due to the vomiting and 
purging. That is my mother's own opinion. After being in bed for a 
day she was able to get around, but suffered considerable pain in the 
abdomen for forty-eight hours. 

" I presume that owing to the fact that my mother is not very strong 
and has a weak stomach, she was more violently affected than many 
might be. But a poison that in any person can produce such symp-

toms, when taken in so small a quantity, ought to be labeled decidedly 
dangerous. 

"There can be no question that the specimens were A. Morgani, 
as I examined some that were left of those picked, and also gathered 
others from the same patch where these were obtained. 

"As everything relating to mushroom poisoning should be of interest 
to the mycologist and mycophagist, I take the liberty of reporting this 
case." 

The Agaricus Morgani appears to be spreading. In 1901 I found 
large specimens of it outside a stable in Lebanon, Pa. Its appearance 
and luxuriance are so much in its favor, that the toadstool lover will be 
tempted to try it. Experiments in eating it should be conducted with 
the greatest caution. Mcllvaine. (See page 738.)

Morgani, pages 37-39 and plate Vila and XIV. 

Agaricus naucinoides Pk. Rep., 1871: 72. This valuable food 
species is spreading and rapidly increasing in many of the states. Prof. 
Charles H. Peck (Rep., 1900: 162) says of it: "It has shown con- 
siderable variability in some of its characters. Usually its pileus is very 
white and smooth, clean and attractive, but specimens have been found 
this year having the pileus dingy or smoky brown, others have been 
seen in which the cuticle of the pileus was cracked in such a way as to 
form minute squamules, and in one or two instances plants were ob- 
served having the surface of the pileus adorned with minute granules, a 
character attributed to L. naucina Fr. In such cases the importance of 
recognizing the spore characters is shown. By disregarding this char- 
acter our plant has sometimes been referred to L. naucina and some- 
times to Agarictis cretaceus Fr., both of which it closely resembles, and 
with which it appears to be confused by European mycologists, some 
referring it to one species and some to the other."

These lamellae are uneven on the edge, and in some cases they appear 
to extend upward on the stem till they meet the true lamellae. 

From further gatherings made in Washington, D. C., and Newark, 
Wayne county, New York, Prof. Peck draws another description (Rep., 
1907: 139) as follows: 

Pileus fleshy, convex, becoming nearly plane in larger plants, even, 
obtuse, glabrous, whitish or yellowish. Flesh white. Lamellae thin, 
close, adnate, purplish brown in the mature plant. Stem commonly 
short, solid, sometimes hollow in large plants, white, annulate, the 
annulus thick, white, with la'mellae on the upper surface. Spores 
elliptic, .0004 to .0005 of an inch long, .0002 to .0003 broad. 

Prof. Peck further remarks upon this characteristic species as follows : 
"The species is well marked by the peculiar character of its collar. On 
the upper surface are miniture gills which radiate from the stem to the 
margin of the collar. These are narrow, white and uneven or dentate 
on the margin. They are sometimes stained by the spores, but these 
have probably fallen from the true gills above. In some instances the 
inner extremity of the false gills extends upward on the stem and ap- 
pears to connect with the gills above. This peculiar character of the 
collar seems to be shown in Stropliaria coronilla (Bull.) Fr. and forcibly 
suggests the thought that our plant is specifically the same as the 
European." 

Prof. Peck, loc. cit. draws a table of comparative characters between 
the American and the European species, and concludes that while there 
is a strong similarity between them, it seems to him best to retain the 
species above described. 

Prof. Peck secured enough material of the species to test it as to its 
edibility, and includes it under the heading Edible Fungi, but does not 
describe the edible qualities. 

Hypholoma Bonghtoni Pk. Rep., 1909: 23. Pileus fleshy, thin 
except in the center, broadly convex or subhemispheric, rarely with a 
slight umbo, glabrous or slightly fibrillose, often concentrically and 
areolately cracking, pale reddish brown or grayish brown. Flesh 
whitish, taste disagreeable. Lamellae unequal, moderately close, ad- 
nate, purplish brown, seal brown or blackish, obscurely spotted, whitish 
on the edge. Stem equal, floccosely fibrillose, striate at the top, hol-

low, white or whitish. Spores black on white paper, broadly elliptic, 
10-12 x 7-8/t. 

Pileus 2.5-7cm. broad, stem 2.5-6cm. long, 4-iomm. thick. 



(Plate CCXI.) 




Ground in woods and in open places. 
Near Pittsford, Monroe county, and at 
Menands, New York. August. 

This species is closely allied to Hy- 
pJioloma vclutinnm (Pcrs.) Fr., from 
which it may be separated by its dry, 
not hygrophanous, pileus, its whitish 
flesh and stem, the absence of cystidia 
and the larger spores. The spore print 
of both this and Hypholoma rigidipes 
Pk. is black on white paper. This 
would indicate a close relationship to 
the Melanosporae, not only of these

two species, but probably also of the 
closely related species, H. velutinum 
(Pers.) Fr. and H. lachrymabundum 
Fr. Peck. 

There is no report on the edibility of 
this species. It is, however, doubtless 
safe. 

Boletus acidus Pk. Rep., 1905 : 15. 
Pileus fleshy, rather thin, firm, con- 
vex, very glutinous when moist, yel- 
lowish white, the margin of the young 
plants often appendiculate with frag- 
ments of the whitish floccose and glu- 
tinous veil. Flesh whitish, taste acid and disagreeable. Tubes short, 
adnate, concave in the mass in young plants, becoming plane with age, 
the mouths minute, subrotund, pale yellow, becoming darker with age.

Stem firm, equal or slightly tapering upward, subflexuous, solid, 
minutely dotted with brown or brownish glands both above and below 
the slight, mostly glutinous and evanescent annulus. Spores subferru- 
gineous, oblong elliptic, .0003-. 0004 of an inch long, .000 12-. 00016 
broad. 

Pileus 1-2 inches brad. Stem 1.5-3 inches long, 2-3 lines thick. 
Under pine and hemlock trees. Port Henry, New York. August. 

This species belongs to the section Viscipelles. It is closely related 
to Boletus punctipes and B. americamis, from which it is separated by 
its slight but mostly evanescent annulus, and by its acid taste. Peck 

The edible qualities of this species are unknown. Whatever may be 
its innocence, its acidity renders it at least forbidding. 

Boletus AtkinSOni Pk. Rep., 1904: 20. Pileus fleshy, convex or 
nearly plane, dry, grayish brown or yellowish brown, sometimes min- 
utely rimosely squamulose. Flesh white, taste mild. Tubes convex, 
plane or slightly concave in the mass, 
adnate or slightly depressed around the 
stem, 3-4 lines long, the mouths min- 
ute, at first whitish and stuffed, soon 
open and yellow or subochraceous. 
Stem stout, equal or slightly thickened 
at one or both ends, solid reticulated 
wholly or at the top only with fine 
anastomosing brownish lines, pallid. 
Spores fusiform or oblong, .0004 to 
.0005 of an inch long, .00016 to .0002 
broad. 

Pileus 34 inches broad ; stem 2-4 
inches long, 612 lines thick. 

Woods. Port Jefferson, New York. 
August. 

The species belongs to the section 
Edules. The reticulations of the stem 
are so delicate that they sometimes 
nearly disappear in drying. Peck. 

There is no report available as to the edible qualities of this form.

Boletus laricinus Berk., Pk. in Rep., 1904: 46. Pileus flesh}-, 
broadly convex or nearly plane, viscid when moist, sometimes squam- 
ose, dingy white or grayish white. Flesh white. Tubes short, adnate 

or slightly decurrent, whitish when 
young, becoming darker and brown 
with age, their mouths large, angu- 
lar, subcompound. Stem short, 
solid, annulate, reticulate above the 
ring, grayish or brownish below. 
Spores brown, oblong, .0004 to 
.0005 of an inch long. .00016 to 
.0002 broad. 

Under or near larch trees. New 
York. October. 

The larch boletus takes its name 
from its place of growth. It is 
closely related to the Elba boletus 
(B. elbensis Pk.) which is found 
under or near tamarack trees in the 
northern part of our state. In the 

n ^giifiH^ ^Sl^^i larch boletus the cap is paler and 

^ i/ 2nal has no pinkish brown tint which 

often is seen on the cap of the Elba 
boletus. The cap is sometimes adorned by brown or blackish scales 
which are easily rubbed or washed away, leaving the whitish cap en- 
tirely naked. The flesh is soft and white or whitish. The tubes are at 
first whitish, but they change with age to brownish and then to a dark 
sepia color. The mouths are large and angular. In some cases shorter 
dissepiments within the larger tubes give them the appearance of being 
composed of two or more smaller ones. The tube walls extend down- 
ward on the stem to the ring and by anastomosing give the reticulated 
appearance called cribose in the older descriptions. This is one of the 
distinguishing characters between the larch boletus and the Elba boletus. 
The larch boletus is worthy of a place among our esculent species. I 
have not yet tested the edible qualities of the Elba boletus. Peck.

tint, the central part adorned with many minute slightly darker areolate 
spots or dots. Flesh whitish, taste mild. Tubes small, adnate or 
depressed about the stem, ventricose 
in the mass, the mouths subrotund, 
at first whitish, becoming greenish yel- 
low. Stem equal or tapering upward, 
pallid, solid, fibrose striate. Spores 
dark olive green, oblong, .00045 to 
.0006 of an inch long, .00016 to .0002 
broad. 

Pileus 3 to 4 inches broad ; stem 3 to 
5 inches long, 4 to 8 lines thick. 

In woods. Bolton, New York. August. 

This species belongs to the section 
Edules. It was not found in sufficient 
quantity for testing its edibility, but it 
is probably edible. Peck. **&& y 9na t 

Scleroderma verrucosum maculatum Pk. Rep., 1899: 848. Sub- 
sessile, globose or depressed globose, I to 3 inches broad. Peridium 
thick, firm, brown, adorned with minute, thin, dark brown squamules 

which often fall from the upper part, 
leaving it dotted with small, round, pale 
or yellowish spots. Spores blackish in 
the mass, globose, warted, .0006 to 
.0007 of an inch broad. Tramal walls 
yellowish brown. 

Mucky soil in woods. Rosendale, 
New York. September. 

The specimens found were too old to 
show the interior color of the young 
plant, and not old enough to show the 
manner in which the peridium ruptures. 
The general color of the peridium is 
Vandyke brown, and the scales are so 
minute that at first sight it appears to be 
smooth. On close inspection it is seen to be abundantly dotted with 
minute flattened scales, which are so loosely attached that they are apt

to fall away, each one leaving a small pale spot or dot on the peridium 
similar to those left by the falling of the warts from the peridium of 
Lycoperdon gemmatum. Scleroderma verrucosum is said to be very 
variable in size and color and in the degree of roughness of the exterior. 
Its warts are described as persistent and adnate. Authors do not agree 
in their description of the spores, one describing them as minute and 
another saying that they are larger than those of any other species of 
this genus. But in no description do I find any reference to the decidu- 
ous character of the scales and the consequent dotting of the surface of 
the peridium which is shown by our specimens. For this reason it has 
seemed best to separate our plant as a variety worthy of recognition. 
Possibly a more complete knowledge of it may show it to be worthy 
even of specific distinction. Peck. 

All North American species of this genus, so far as known at present, 
are edible. Care should be taken however to pare them well; to see 
that the specimens are not wilted; to cut away the bases, and to cook 
them thoroughly. 

Agaricus Morgani Pk. Since the remarks concerning this species 
on pages 730 and 731 were set in type, Mr. O. E. Lansing, Jr. (who 
collected, in 1902, the material which I then photographed and which 
now forms the upper half of Plate Vila.) reports that: At about 6 p. 
m. he ate a bit, about the size of a silver quarter, of one of the plants 
photographed. In about two hours he was attacked with numbness of 
the legs, faintness, burning in the throat and nausea; followed soon by 
excessive vomiting and purging which continued at intervals until 4 a. 
m. accompanied by great fear of death. Lassitude and weakness super- 
vened but he was able to go about his duties that morning, and no fur- 
ther unpleasant effects followed so far as he now remembers. 

In both the case of Mr. Lansing and that of Mrs. Clementson (page 
730) the poisoning resulted from eating a small piece of the raw plant. 
It is possible that those who have found the species inocuous ate the 
cooked plant only. However, the species is one that should be carefully 
diagnosed, well separated in the mind from A. procerus, and its collec- 
tion as a food rigidly avoided. Millspaugh.
