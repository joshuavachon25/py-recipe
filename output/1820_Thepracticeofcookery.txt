Google 



This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on Hbrary shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we liave taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying.

+ Refrain fivm automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attributionTht GoogXt "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner

X HE practical part of Cookerj/^ Pastry^ and Con^ 
fectumary^ which now forms so essential and import- 
ant a branch of Female education, is undoubtedly 
of the greatest utility. It embraces objects inti- 
mately connected with the comfort^ as well as the 
expenditure of every family ; because, by extending 
the former, and abridging the latter, it is entitled 
to claim no inconsiderable share of attention and re- 
gard. A thorough conception of it, however, can 
only be attiuned by experience and practice. 

From this source, the Author of the present work 
acquired her knowledge of these arts ; and it will 
be readily admitted, that few are more capable, or 
better qualified to communicate them to others. 
These considerations, joined to the solicitations of 
the Author^s numerous pupils, originally induced 
her to publish it. The doing so has been attended 
with such success, that six editions, consisting of 
upwards of ten thousand copies, have already had 
a very rapid tale-— a circumstance which affords the 
most ample testimony of its having met with the 
approbation of a discerning and intelligent Public. . 

It only remains to be observed, that in this 
seventh edition, not only every new and material 
improvement has been carefully adopted, but the 
most simple rules, founded on a very lon^ «:cA^^- 



4 TO THE PUBLIC. 

tenRivc practice, are laid down, for the ease and ac- 
commiKlation of every practitioner. In short, no 
exertion ha6 been wanting to render the whole uni- 
versally useful^ to combine simplicity with elegance^ 
and economy with variety. 



N. B.— rAc liquid measures are given^ Jirst in

ing table :

IfEMARKS ON CHOOSING PROVISIONS. 

Veef^'i}^ beef^ if young, has a fine^ 
mnooth, open grain, of a pleasing carnation 
ised, and is very tender ; tiie fat rather white 
t^aan yellow, and the suet white.-*— The graia 
{jfeow beef is closer, and the fat whiter^ 
but tibe lean not so bright a red as ttie otdicv. 
The grain of bull beef is still closer, the &t 
hard and sflsiinny, the lean of a deep red,xkiiA 
smdls stronger than cow -or ox beef 

Mutton. — If young,^ it will feel very ten- 
der ; but if old, it v'Al be hard, «nd the &t 
fibrous and dammy. The grain of ram

mutto)! is dose, the flesh 6f a deep red, and 
the fet spongy. The flesh of ewe mutton is 
pkler thkn^the wedder, and the grain closer. 
Sh6rt-shanked mutton is the best. 

Lamb.— If the vein in the neck of the 
fore-qtiarto? appears of a fine blue, it is 
fresh ; but if green or yellow, it is stale. If 
the bind quarter has a faint disagreeable 
smell near the kidney, or if the knuckle be 
Hmber, it is not good. The head is good 
WheSithe eyes &re bright and plump, but 
Statle if sunk arid wrinkled. 

FealU^Tbe flesb of cow-calf is whiter 
i^h'^that of bull, but not so firm ; the fillet 
of the former is generally preferred, on ac 
G^ilnt of the udder. If the vein in the 
i^holilder is not of a bright red, it is not 
frefeh ; and if there be any green or yellow 
iBlp^ts in it, it is bad. A good neck and 
toeast will be white and dry ; but if clam- 
igfly, and look green or yellow at the upper 
end, they are. stale. The kidney is apt 
soonest to taint in the loin, and if stale, it 
will be soft and slimy. A leg is good if it 
be firm and white ; but bad if limber, and 
the flesh flabby, with green or yellow spots. 
The same observations with regard to the 
lamb's head hold as to this. 

Par^.-r-Measley pork is dangerous to eat.

It is known ,by the fat being full of little 
kernels. If young, the lean wiU break on 
being pinched, the skin will dint by pinch- 
ing it with the fingers, and the fat» Uke lard, 
will be soft and pulpy. If the rind is thick, 
rough, and cannot be easily pinched^ it is 
old. If the flesh is cool ^and smooth, it i& 
fresh ; but if clammy, it is tainted, and the 
knuckle part will always be the worst: 
i^ ^ Hams. — ^Those are best which . have the 
shortest shank. If, by introducing: a knife 
under the bone, it come out clean, and smell 
well, it is good ; but if /it be daubed and 
isimeared,or has a disagreeable smell, it is.bad. 
JSacon. — If good, the fat will feel oily, 
kx^ white, the lean will be of agood colour, 
and stick close to the bone ; but bad, or will 
be soon rusty, if there are streaka. in the 
lean. The rind of young bacon> is always 
thin> but thick if old. . - 

. Brawn. — ^The rind of old brawn is thick 
a^d hard. The rind and fat of biurrow and 
sow brawn are very tender. 
♦. F<^i[^it.-^The fat of venison must deter- 
mine the choice of it. If the fat is thick, 
bright, and clear, the clefts smooth and 
close, it is young ; but if the clefts are wide 
;and rough, it is old. It will first change at 
the haunches and shoulders. If fresh, it will

Turkej^^^^U a cock->tuTkey is youngs it 
wili have a' smooth black leg, with shovt 
apurs, the eyes full and bright, and tbe feet 
limber and mokt ; but see that the sptil^s 
are hot scraped, to deceiTe. When stale, 
the feet are dry and the eyes sank. Th^ 
kgs of the hen^ if she is old, wiU be Miigh 
and red ; and if with egg, the vent will be 
soft and openJ 

Cocks md Hetu.'^The spars of a yoKmg 
cock are short. The vents will foe open^ if 
stale ; but dose and hard, if fresh. Beiis 
are always best wheii fv^ of eggs^ and just 
before they begin to lay. The eotnb of a 
good capdi is pale, the breast fat, the belly 
thick, and the rump large. 

Geese. — ^A yellow bill and feet, with few 
hairs upon them, are the marks of a yotmg 
goose ; but these are red when old. The feet 
will be limber, if fresh ; but stiff and dry, if 
stale. Green geese are in season firom May 
to June, till they are three months dd. A 
stubble goose is good till it be five or six 
months old, and should be picked dry. The 
same rules will hold as to wild geese, with 
respect to their being young or old.

and stiff. Those of a tame one are. of a 
duidky yeUow, and thick. The feet of a 
wikL duck are smaller than a tame one^ and 
are of a ]«ddish colour. 

Pkea$ants. — These beautiful birds are of 
the English cock and hen kind, and, of a 
fine fiavour^ The cock has spurs^ and the 
ben^ is most valued when with egg. The 
spurs of a young cock are round ; but if old^ 
they are long and sharp. If the vent of the 
hen be open and gxeen, she ia stale ; if with 
egg, 4t will be soft. 

Woodcocks — are birds of passagey ami 
found with us only ia the winter. . They 
are best a f(t»rtni^t or three weeks after 
their first appearance^ and have rested after 
their long flight over the ocean. If fat, 
they wiU be firaxi and thick, and a vein^of

ohoiee of a turkey will hold as to these birds* 
' JPigeans, S^c. — ^They are full and fat at the 
vent, and limber-footed, when new ; . but if 
the. toes are harsh, and the vent loose, open, 
and. green, ihsj are stale. If old, the .legs 
Viill be large, and red. The tame pigeon is 
preferable ;to the wild, is larger in the body, 
and fat and tender. Wood-pigeons^are lar- 
ger than wild ones,, but like them in .other 
respects. The same rules will hold in the 
choice of the ^foi?^r,^Zc^r^, thrush^ U^hy 
Uackbircly 8^c. 

\ . JBTar^^.— When old, the daws are blunt 
and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the 
deft wide and large ; if young, the claws 
are. smooth and sharp, the ears tear easily, 
and the cleft in the lip much spread. . The 
body.. will be stiff, and the flesh p^de, if 
newly killed; but if the flesh is tuming 
black and the body limber, it is stale : they 
are not:.always considered the worse* of bet- 
ing kept till, they smell a little. . . \ i v.

wool and daws are smooth. If stale, they 
will be limber, the flesh bluish, and hame a 
kind of slime upon it ; but if fresh, they 
will be stiff, and the flesh \rhite and dry. 

Fish. — ^The general rule for knowing 
whether fish are fresh or stale, is by obser- 
ving the smell and colour of the gills,, which 
should be of a lively red ; whether they be 
luurd or easily opened, the standuig out or 
sinking in of the eyes, the fins stiff or lim^ 
ber, or by the gills. Fish taken in running 
water are always better than those fi'om 
ponds. 

' Turhot — ^is good when thick and plump, 
and the belly of a yellowish white ; but bad, 
if thin and bluish. It is in season the greater 
part of the summer, and is generally caught 
in the German and British Oceans. 

Soles^-^Qxe good when thick and firm, 
and the belly of a fine cream colour ; but bad 
if flabby, or incline to a bluish white. Mid- 
summer is the principal season for them. 

. Lob^ers. — If fi'esh, the tail will be stiff, 
and puH up with a spring ; but if stale, it 
will be flabby, and have , no spring. If 
newly taken, the daws will have a quick 
and sttong motion upon pinchjing the eyes ; 
t}ie heaviest are. esteemed the best. The 
cock lobster is narrow in the back part of

teXLy smaller than the feiiKsJe, ha& the high- 
est flavour, the flesh firmer, and the body

SStmrgetm.^^The flesh of a good one is 
white, with a few blue "mn^ the grain even^ 
the skin tender, good coloured, and toft, 
and the veins and gristles blue ; when these 
are brown or yellow, and the skin harsh, 
tough, and dry, the fish is had. It has a 
pleasant smell when good, but a disagree- 
able one when bad. It should cut firm 
without crumbling. The females are full 
of roe. 

Dried Ling. — It is best when thick in 
the pole, and the flesh of a Inight ydlow. 

Cod — ^is good when thick at the neck, the 
flesh white and firm, of a bright dlear co- 
lour^ and the gills red. When flabby it is 
not good. 

S^te — is good when very whitel and 
thick. When too firesh, it eet& tough ; and 
if stftle, it has a disagreeable smdh .- ^

Trout, — ^AH kinds of fresh-water fish aie 
excdQent ; but the best are red and ydkyw. 
The female i» most esteemed, and is known 
by its small head, and deep body. They 
are in high season the latter end of May^ . 

Tend. — This is also a fresh- watev fish, 
and is in season in July, August,' land Sep* 
tember. It should be dressed alive ;• but: if 
dead^ see that the gtUs are red, and hard to 
open, the eyes bright, and the boe^ firm 
and stifi. > 

Salmon — ^when fresh, is of a fine red, and 
particularly so at the gills; the scales bright^ 
and the fish very stiff. The spring is the best 
season for this fish. Pickled salmon is good, 
if the flesh feels oily, and the scales stiff and 
shining. 

Smelts. — ^When firesh, they are of a fine 
silver hue, very firm, and have an agreea- 
ble smell, resembling that of a cucumber. 

Mvh — ^are always in season, except du- 
ring the hot summer months. 

Flounders — are in season from January 



10 llARKETING. PART I. 

to March, and from July to September. 
When fresh they are stiff, their eyes bright 
9nd full, and theu* bodies thick. 

Oysters-^Bxe known to be alive arid vi- 
gorous when they dose fast upon the kiiife, 
and let it go as soon as they are wounded 
in the body ; are best when large and white, 
and are in season from September to April. 
' i Praums and Shrimps — ^wfaen in perfect 
tion» have an excellent snidl, are firm and 
stiffs and their tails turn stiffly inwards.-^ 
Their colour is bright when fresh ; but 
stale, if the tails are limber, and they look 
pale and clammy. 

Cro&^^-^When in perfection, the joints of 
the legs are stiff, and the body of a sweet 
smell. When too long kept, the joints are 
limber, the eyes look dead and loose, and 
they have a bad smell. Rock crabs arc the 
best. 

Butter. — In buying fresh butter, trust 
more to taste than smell. In choosing salt 
butter, trust rather to smell than taste. If it 
is in a cask, have it unhooped, and probed 
to the bottom. * 

Cheese.^^im is old, with a rough and rag- 
ged coat, or dry at top, you may expect to 
find worms or mites in it. If moist, spongy, 
or full of holes, it is magotty. When you 



CHAP. II. EOAAaMNO^ BOUSING, &c. II 

perceive any. blemishes on the outside, be 
sure to probe it to the bottom ; for thougk 
the blemish appear small, the eheese may be 
considerably injured within. « 

JEgg^. — ^^ judge properly of an egg, put 
the gi^eater end of it to your tongue, and if 
it feel warm, it is new ; but if cold, it m 
stale ; pr if, by holding it up before the sun 
or a candle, the yoke a^ip&n round, and 
the vihite dear and fair, it is good ; but if 
th^ yoke is broken, and the white doudy, 
it is bad. - « .;

A leg of mutltm of six pounds will tslke 
about an hour and a quarter to roast; nine 
pounds, an hour and three quarters; and 
twelve pounds, two hours and a half. To 
pari and veal it is common to allow a quar- 
ter of an hour to every pound ; and tO' a 
pig J if newly killed, little more liian an hoM ; 
if killed a day or two, some time longet^i 
but much depends upon the fire ; and it w 
observable, that meat takes l6nger of ddsig 
in frosty than in fresh and mild weathet.''' 

Fowls require a brisk fire, to maOke them 
eat sWeet and look well. The Inreast of a 
goose or turkey must be papered tiH nearly 
done^ A middling one will take an hotir 
to roast; a very large one an hourdiida 
quarter, and a small one three quarters of 
an hour; a large fowl, or duck, three quar- 
ters of an hour; a middling one half an 
hour ; and chickens, pigeons, and other small 
birds, about twenty minutes ; but this en- 
tirely depends upon the fire being quick

Iped well. A leg of veal of twelve pounds 
will take three hours and a half to boil, and 
will be whiter and more plump the slower 
it Is boiled. Mutton and beef do not re- 
quire much boilitig; but iamb^ pork^ a))d 
vealf must be well done. A leg of park 
will take an hour more to boil than a leg of 
Mo^of the same weight; a leg of lamb of 
ibur! pounds will take an hour and a half; a 
SbBi^ ^y tongue vfVH take three hours boiU 
ing^ and a pickled one two, after being pre- 
i^otisly Trteeped two hours. ' Fowls must be 
boAed in plenty of Wftter, on a good fire, 
ahd'W^ scummed. They may be boiled 
in a cloth or haggies-bag ; the bag by some 
is ^fierred, as it retains the juice; but it 
fldiot be cleaned well, and large enough to 
allow the fowl to swell. A small turkey 
will take about an hour to boil ; a large one 
kn hoUr and a half; a hen half an hour> and 
a ki^e chicken about twenty minutes. 

■Spoiling.— After the gridiron has been 
Well heated on a clear glossy fire, rub it 
over with a piece of suet. Steaks in parti- 
cular require to be frequently turned, and 
served very hot.

OF SOUPS. 



Brown Soup. 

Take six pounds of beef, and score it, to 
draw out the juice; then put it in a pot 
with six Scotch pints of water, (three gal- 
lons English,) a small piece of the lean of 
bacon ham, two or three onions, a large car- 
rot, two turnips cut small, and a biinch of 
sweet herbs. Boil it three hours on a mo- 
derate fire till it is a good deal reduced, and 
the soup strong and well tasted. Thetk ciit 
a pound of beef into sm^lL steaks ; season 
them with mixed 8pide3, wd dredge, th&tji 
with a little flour. Put a piece of butter 
into a frying-pan, and turn it poitsti^tljr 
one way till it is of a rich darkibro^^^ Lay 
in the steaks ; and when Inrownedl qx\ both 
sides till they are crisp; take them outy.4rfiin 
theni from the butter, and put them anvoDg 
the soup, adding some more mixed spices 
and salt. When the soup has boiled three 
quarters of an hour, strain it through a 
Bieve, and scum o£f the &t.

Transparent Soup. 

This is made the same way as the former, 
with the addition of the whites of six beat 
eggs, and two table-spoonfuls of mushroom 
ketchup. This being added to the soup, 
let it boil about five minutes more, then run 
it through a jelly-bag till it is clear. Serve 
it up on toasted bread, or vermicelli.

better than one made with sugar. The ar-

more disagreeable and offensive than to see

' » To heat Butter. 

Put a little milk or water in the bottom 
of a sauce-pan, with a quarter of a pound of 
butter cut in slices ; dredge in a little flour, 
and shake the pan constantly round to the 
right hand until the butter turns thick, 
smooth, and white like a cream. 

To clarify Butter. 

Put the butter in a pan, and let it boil ; 
then take it off, and scum it. Pour it out 
into a bason ; taking care to keep back the 
milk and sediment at the bottom of the pan. 
This answers for all kinds of potted meat.

over them two pints (four quarts) of boiling 
white- wine vinegar, and close up the pit- 
cher. Let it stand by the fire five or six 
days, and shake it every day ; then tie it 
up, and let it stand three months, by which 
time it will lose the bitter taste. When it 
is to be bottled, put the whole into a hair

tie a day longer, and bottle off the fine. 
Liet the remainder settle till it fines itself^ 
and continue to do so till the whole is fit to 
be bottled. It may be used in any white 
sauce without hurting the colour, and is 
good for fish sauce and made dishes. A 
tea-spoonful will be sufiicient in white sauce^ 
and two in brown sauce, for a fowl. It is a 
most useful pickle, and gives a grateful fla- 
vour; but be careful always to put it in 
before thickening the sauce, or putting in 
cream, to prevent curdling.

and shoulders very clean in cold water, and 
pour boiling water all over the one side of 
the fish, and with a knife, as quick as possi- 
ble, take oiF the black slime that covers the 
skin, but take care not to break it. Turn 
the fish carefully, and do the same to the 
other sidf. Have a pan boiling with as 
much water as will cover it, mix into it half 
a mutehldn (half a pint) of common vine-

keep the bread crisp, and the parsley green, 
till the following sauce is made : strain the 
stock, and thicken it with a little butter 
knead in flour, adding half a mutchkin 
(half a pint) of white wine, half a hundred 
of oysters, with some of their liquor, the 
squeeze of a lemon, a little white pepper 
and salt, and the meat of a boiled lobster 
cut small. Boil it a few minutes, and scum 
it well ; then lift the dish from the fijre, 
and wipe it clean. Pour some of the sauce 
about the fish, and serve up the rest in a 
boat or bason. Garnish with fiiedi flouh^

stock is strong and well tasted, strain, and 
thicken it with browned butter and flour, 
and season with spices and a spoonful of 
ketchup ; then put it in a sauce-pan, and 
when it comes to boil, put in the fish, with 
some oysters or mussels, and a little of their 
juice, also some cut pickles when they are 
about to be dished. If you want the sauce 
rieher, make a stock of beef in place of fish. 
It is much the better of a little wine.

.OF PUDDINGS, FAKCAKF8, AKD t^JSTAttOS. 



Observations oa maJdfig Puddings. 

W^HEN a pudding is to be boiled» take care 
that the cloth it is to be put into is very 
clean, and that it be dipped in boiling water, 
dredged with flour, and shaked weU before 
the pudding is put into it. K a bread pild- 
ding, it must be tied loose ; if a biatfcer one, 
it must be tied tight. If it is to be boiled 
in a shape, or bason, it must be buttered 
well before it is put in; when ready^ it must 
be takmi out carefully, and allowed to stand 
a few minutes befoie the tie is unlobsed. 
All puddings must be boiled in plenty 
of water, turned frequently, kept close co- 
vered, and never allowed to go off the boiL 
If the pudding is to be baked, the dUsh or 
pan must be also buttered before it is put 
in. Bread and custard puddings require 
tinie, and a moderate oven, to raise dion; 
on the contrary, batter and rice puddings 
require a quick oven. Butter to be used in 



line puddings must not be oiled, but cast to a 
cream ; because when oiled, it makes them 
eat heavy, and is apt to swim on the top. 
Ornament all fiiiepuddihg»^ith a cut puff 
paste border and flowers.

if four pounds of sugar is to be dsoA&ed, pn^ 
a mutchkin (pint) of water in a brass pan ; 
bopeak into it the iwhil^ of two eggs^ • and 
cast it with a switch ; break the sugar weU> 
and put it into it ; pour over it another half 
mutchkin (half a pint) of water, and give 
the pan a shak^. Let it jstand to soften a 
little, and then put it on the fire ; stir it till 
the sugar is quite dissolved n when it comes

half mutchkin (hali' pint) of water ; and let 
it boil a little longer ; then take it ofl^ and 
when it has settled, sciim it, and lay '■ the

run from it : put the syrup again on the 
fire, and let it boil a few minutes longer, 
then set it off to settle a little, take off the 
scum, and it will l)e sufficiently clarified. 

To botl Stugar to Pearling Height. 

Clarify the sugar as in last receipt ; then 
set it on the fire, and when it turns up in

and then into the syrup, to try it, shaking

strongly through the holes of the skimmer. 
Wfaein you see the syrup flying from it like

' To candy Sugar. 






Harving boiled the sugar as in last receipt, 
take it off the fire, then hold the pan to one 
side, and candy the syrup, by grinding it 
with the baqk of a spoon upon the side of 
the pan. This answers for candying all kinds 
of fruit flowers. 

To boil Sugar to Crackling He^At. 

Boil the sugar a degree higher than candjf 
heighty have ready a pot of cold water, and 
a bit of stick ; dip the stiqk, foi^t into the 
boiling syrup, then into the water, and try 
it in the teeth. If it sticks to them like 
glue, it is not enough; but when it crackles, 
it is finished. In boiUng sugar to this height 
it is apt to fly, therefore take care that the 
fire is not too brisk ; or if it cannot be other- 
wise managed, put in the smaltesit bit gf 
sweet butier^ to check it*

, , : To preserve Oranges whole. 

Take half a dozen of large highHX>loured 
bitter oranges, and cut them out with an 



(^ngie razor, (no deeper than the yellow 
rhind) ill hnitatftiri t# floWefrt * and 4eaT«8; 
or grate and ridge th^ilQ ; tiien lay ihetA m 
ib tnueh water ad will carer them/ mteed 
with half a pound of dalt, and put < a ' piatci 
above them, to keep them under the waiter, 
iifter they hirre lain two days, take them 
out, and put them in fresh water other two 
days^ then put them on the fire with cold 
water, and let them boil till the head of a 
pin can easily pierce the skin. Clarify M 
pound of sugar for each orange : make a 
small hole in the stalk end, and scrape out 
the pulp and seeds carefully with the shank 
of a tea-spoon ; place them in a potting* 
pan, so 88 that one may not lie above ano- 
ther : fill the oranges with the syrup^ and 
pour t^e rest of it over them ; when tbe 
syrup is cold, put a plate on the firuii; to 
keep them under it : after they have lain 
two days, take them up one by one» and 
pour the syrup out of them ; then strain 
the syrup, put it on to boil, and scum it; 
when it has boiled about six minutes,? take 
it off to cool a little, and then pour it into 
and over the oranges ; let them stand four 
days, and then take them out again ; if they 
are dear and transparent, and the aynqp 
pjBetty thicks squeeze in tbe juioe of iour 



bitter oranges^ to prevent it froi9ev:^ndyii^ 
which gives tbe oranges a finetflnvour ; b<^ 
u|> the ^y rup agaiA^ and scum it^ then put 
in the oranges one by one ; ^nd when thej 
have boiled five minutes longer, take tbem 
OII4; tcarefnlly^ pot them up» pour tbe syrup 
over themi but be sure they are wdl cover*- 
ed with it. Preserved angeUca^ nicked 
found the edges with a runner, in imita- 
tion of the leaves of a pine-apple, makes 
beautiful tops to the oranges. • 

To preserve Orange Skins. 

t w 

\ . 

^ Do them the same way as directed in tln^ 
last receipt ; only observe to case the skinis^ 
in cHie another, and put them into a can 
that will hold them easUy ; clarify weight 
for weight of sugar and skins, and pom: the 
syrup over them when it is quite cG^d: put 
a small saucer, with a small weight upcm 
it, to keep the skins down among tbe sy** 
rup: let them stand four or five dayis, tiU 
very thin, then strain and boil it up with 
more wgar, till it is (tf a proper thickness!, 
and when it is cold, pour it over the skins^: 
let them stand three or four days Jonger^ 
and the syrup ^vill be thin again, though 
not so thin as before : then strain, boil, and 



setim it, put the skins in a pah aiiiong the 
syhip, and let them boil until the^' are 
transparent ; case, and pot them up as be^- 
fore, and pour the syrup over them, taking 
care they are well covered with it. Three 
or four of the skins turned down, with a 
slice of preserved orange between each, 
make a very pretty asset. 

* 

To preserve Oranges in Slices. 

Grate the oranges, and cut them cross-i 
ways in thin slices ; pick out the seeds, but 
take care not to break the pulp : lay tiie sli-

eount' preferred by some. The slices ought 
neither to be cut too thick nop toothin* . 

Brisket qfBeef, — ^This part is generally 
boiled, and cut tbe long way, quite down 
to the bone. The £pit of this slice is .firm 
and gristly. Before helping it about, always

Pare^Qfu^ier of Ijamb. — This is always 
roasted. First separate the shoulder fixmi 
the breast, arid squieeze an orange or lemon 
cm the parts ; sprinkle them with salt, and 
join them, again; then separate thegristlj 
parts from the ribs, to make them divide 
easily, and Carve the shoulder in the same 
way as mutton. The company can thus be 
served with the ribs, gristly part, or shoulder, 
as they incline. 

Ham. — There are three ways oi cutting 
a ham ; some begin at the knuckle, some 
begin at the thick end, and others in the 
middle, which is perhaps the best method. 
It must be cut in very thin slices.

the body. The most delicate parts Bre the 
neck and ribs, but every part of a young 
pg eats well. 

launch of Venison. — First cut it cross 
down to the bone at some ' little distance 
from the knuckle ; then from the middle of 
that cut make another, as deep as you can, 
the length- way, so that the two cuts * may 
form the letter T : after this, take as many 
slices lengthways as you may find occasion 
for. • These slices must neither be cut too 
thick nor too thin. They are served up 
with some of the £at and gravy, along with 
red currant jelly. 

' FISH. 

Salmon. — The belly is the fattest part; 
it is therefore proper to help a thin slice 
of both back and belly along with the skin, 
to those whp like it. 

TurboL — The thickest part of it is es- 
teemed the best. Enter the fish-knife in 
the middle, over the back-bone, and take off 
a neat piece on one side close to it. 

Soah.— Cut them right through the mid- 
dle, bone and all.

To preserve the Whiteness and Flavour of 

Fresh Fish. 

The fish being well cleaned, washed, and 
wiped, cut and pare ofi* the tails and fins, to 
make them bleed ; then pass a rod through 
the under chop, and hang them. This will 
make them of a delicate whiteness and fla- 
vour, prevent their being discoloured by the 
blood, and of course make them keep longer.

RULES 



FOR 



PLACING DISHES ON A TABLE. 



BB 



The grand object, in the setting out of a 
table, is to have it finished with the best 
of meats, well dressed, and arranged with 
taste and judgment. 

If three courses are intended, the first 
generally consists of soup, or of fish dressed 
or plain boiled ; the second, of roasted, baked, 
or made dishes ; and the third, of dessert and 
ornamental dishes, for which, see chap. v. 
p. 251. ; also of fruits, natural, artificial, 
and preserved ; custards, cheese-cakes, frit- 
ters, meringues, wafers, &c. 

If there is only to be one course, and the 
company very large, the table must be fur- 
nished with good substantial dishes, and par- 
ticipate of the other two courses. In that 
case, too, soup may be placed at both ends,, 
and removed by fish. If there is no soup, 
plain or dressed fish, or made dishes, may 
be substituted in its place.
