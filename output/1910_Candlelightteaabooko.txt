pagne. Pour over block of ice in punch bowl on 
which has been placed a couple of bunches of hot- 
house grapes (green preferred), and several pink roses.

sweet cream is used, add sugar first, then whiskey^

Fill individual moulds about one-quarter full of aspic 
jelly; let stand until it begins to congeal, then press 
in chicken, nuts or sweetbread salad, that has already 
been mixed with mayonnaise. When thoroughly chilled, 
turn out on lettuce leaf and serve with a touch of 
mayonnaise on top of each mould.

ASPIC JELLY 

Aspic jelly is made from any meat stock, chicken, 
beef or veal; clear with white of egg, the same as for 
bouillon, then add to one quart of stock one box of 
gelatine that has been soaked for an hour in a cup of 
cold water; season highly with salt, cayenne, table- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Pour in square mould and 
cut in small squares before serving. If preferred indi- 
vidual moulds can be used. 



MOULDED FRUIT SALAD 

Make the same as any fruit salad, using juice of 
minced fruit for the jelly. To one pint of juice add 
three tablespoonsful of granulated gelatine; when jelly 
begins to congeal pour in moulds and press in fruit. 
No sugar must be used in jelly for fruit salad, but a 
small amount of lemon juice adds very much. When 
ready to serve, turn out on lettuce leaf, with a touch 
of mayonnaise. The daintiest fruit salad is made of 
Hawaiian pineapple, white grapes, marischino cherries, 
oranges, grape fruit and a few nut kernels.

with highly seasoned mayonnaise, garnish with sliced 
deviled olives. If canned shrimps are used drain well 
before mixing salad.
