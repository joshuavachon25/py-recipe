MY FRIEND, "THE CHIEF," 
HERBERT CLARK HOOVER 

IN TOKEN OF MY 

GREAT ADMIRATION AND 

AFFECTION FOR ONE WHOSE 

NOBILITY OF CHARACTER 

AND BRILLIANCY OF INTELLECT 

ARE EQUALLY OUTSTANDING, 

THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED 



PREFACE 

THIS book grew out of the author's work as Chief of the Statis- 
tical Division of the United States Food Administration from June 
11, 1917 to March 1, 1919. When plunged into the business of 
making war it was found in this country, as it had been in every 
other of the fighting nations, that many data were lacking which 
were essential to any reasonable prediction as to what the food 
position was going to be with the passage of time. The work of the 
Statistical Division of the Food Administration in its early days 
was chiefly a desperate struggle to get some sort of approximation 
to an answer for such questions as: " What is our normal consump- 
tion of milk?" "How much wheat can we spare for export?" 
"How much meat must be conserved to meet export demands 
and still not injure physiologically the home population?" 

As time passed and the organization of the food producing and 
distributing agencies of the country was perfected, we came to 
possess unique sources of information from which questions like 
the above could be answered. Still more broadly it was perceived 
that we had better material than had ever been available before on 
which to attempt a thorough and searching statistical survey of 
the food resources and food consumption of the United States. In 
the summer of 1918 I began the task of putting together the material. 
It has proved a far greater labor than was anticipated. 

No attempt has been made to discuss the related literature. 
This omission is deliberate. For the United States certainly a 
statistical analysis of the sort here attempted is pioneer work. 
In my opinion what is most wanted, is a careful, critical, clear and 
unbiased presentation of the statistical data, rather than my 
opinion as to their interpretation. The data comprised in this book 
have interest and significance, it is believed, for a wide range of 
specialists, including certainly the student of agricultural problems, 
of nutritional physiology, of economics, of sociology, and of com- 
merce. The point of view of the writer has been to act as the hod- 
carrier to these various specialists, delivering to them a mass of 
carefully made bricks, believed to be solid and true. From these 

9 



10 PREFACE 

bricks they can build whatever structures they like, far better than 
the statistical hodsman could hope to. 

At this point 1 wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to my loyal 
assistants in the Statistical Division of the Food Administration, 
Dr. Frank M. Surface, Mr. Stephen Chase, Mr. Mortimer B. Lane, 
and Mr. John Rice Miner, without whose aid this work could not 
have been completed for many months, if not years, and without 
whose advice on many technical points the results would have been 
far from having that degree of reliability which I think they now 
possess. The diagrams are the work of Mr. Rudolph von Huhn, 
whose untiring efforts to make the most significant graphical repre- 
sentations of the data have enhanced the value of the work to the 
reader. 

Finally, I wish to pay tribute to my Chief in the Food Adminis- 
tration, Mr. Herbert Clark Hoover, whose never-failing interest 
in the project, whole-hearted encouragement of its prosecution, and 
penetrating criticism of the results at all stages, contributed much 
to whatever measure of success may have been attained in the 
investigation. Such keen and just insight into the problems and 
methods of scientific research as is an integral part of Mr. Hoover's 
daily thought and life, is as rare among great administrators as it 
is welcome.

THE NATION'S FOOD 



CHAPTER I 
THE FOOD PROBLEM 

The substantial truth of the slogan "Food will win the war " 
must now be evident to any thinking person. The relatively enor- 
mous proportion of the total man power involved in direct or indirect 
military activities in all of the belligerent nations except the United 
States, with the heavy involvement of farm man power in this 
country; the disparity between tonnage supplies and needs which 
resulted in a far-reaching dislocation of the normal world trade in 
foodstuffs; the widespread crop reduction below the normal in 
1916 and 1917: and other factors served to make the food problem 
assume a direct military importance in the late conflict, vastly 
greater than it had ever had before. The western world had come 
to look upon its food supply as an inexhaustible thing. Free com- 
munication, both international and national, had made famine or 
anything approaching famine a thing unheard of or undreamed of 
in the part of the world of which we are speaking. Food was to 
be sure sometimes relatively scarce, but that condition only meant 
at the worst high prices for a time. All this the war changed. All 
too many people during the last three years have been brought 
within a threateningly short distance of the grim specter of famine. 

With the ending of actual warfare and the opening of the stage 
of negotiations on November 11, 1918, the food problem of the world 
became not less, but even more pressing than it had been during 
the war. In the first place the moral and spiritual motive on the 
farmer's part to keep production at a maximum in order to help 
"win the war" ceased at once to operate. In the second place, as 
events have shown, the internal political readjustments which 
are taking place in every country involve a general disorganization 
which is not conducive to the production of maximum crops. Hun- 
ger is a potent stimulus to Bolshevism. But unfortunately Bol- 
shevism is not a good alleviaht of hunger. It works in fact quite 
the other way, except for the very short period in which the uprising 
2 17

masses steal any goods, edible or other, which the classes may hap- 
pen to have on hand. In consequence of the destruction of war, on 
the one hand, and Bolshevism on the other hand, the world food 
problem is made more difficult by the additional burden of countries 
normally food exporting, such as Russia, Germany and Austria, and 
devastated countries like Poland, Northern France, Serbia, etc. 

The food conditions in Europe on December 1, 1918, are shown 
graphically in Fig. 1.

FIG. 1. Food map of Europe. 

This diagram shows clearly what a pressing matter the after- 
war food problem is. 

From the beginning of the war Germany realized the menace of 
food shortage. Her very position at the outset, with the certainty 
of an effective blockade sooner or later, made it imperative for her to 
take stock of her food resources, both actual and potential. Hence 
in the report of the Eltzbacher Commission we had the first serious 
attempt at a survey of national food resources. Since that time 



THE FOOD PROBLEM 19 

all of the other principal belligerent countries have carried through 
similar studies, with greater or less critical, scientific acumen. 

It is the purpose of this present book to give as careful and critical 
analysis of the food resources of the United States, as it is possible 
to make with existing information. The need of such a study 
for the United States at this time is greatly enhanced and indeed 
made imperative, by reason of the fact that to an ever-increasing 
degree this country is being called upon to feed Europe. England, 
France, and Italy bore the brunt of the actual fighting for nearly 
four years. This splendid stemming of the tidal wave of mingled 
science and savagery which is Hun warfare, was only accomplished 
at the expense of every form of productivity other than military. 
Especially has agricultural production suffered in these three coun- 
tries because of two factors: first the drawing of agricultural labor 
into the armies, which could not be prevented, on the one hand 
because of the fearful necessity for men at the front, and on the 
other hand because it has not been practically feasible to demon- 
strate to draft officials the essentially skilled character of agri- 
cultural labor. In the second place the enemy occupation of some 
of the best agricultural land, in the case of France and Italy, has 
made tremendous inroads on the national production of foodstuffs. 

With the existing shortage of ocean tonnage, and the enhanced 
needs for what does exist, America becomes almost the only prac- 
tically available source from which may be eked out the diminished 
food resources of the Allies. The extent to which these countries 
have relied upon the United States for food since the beginning 
of the war is not generally recognized. It will be profitable to 
examine, cursorily the facts. 

There are here tabulated (Table 1) the total exports to the 
United Kingdom, France, and Italy of each, of the more important 
food materials from the beginning of the war until our entrance, 
viz., from July 1, 1914, to April 1, 1917, and for comparison with 
this the total exports of these same commodities to the same coun- 
tries for the first year of participation of the United States in the 
war, April 1, 1917 to April 1, 1918. In subsequent tables these 
commodities are reduced to nutritive units and the three periods 
before the war, since the beginning of the war until our entrance, 
and our first year as a belligerent, are compared. 

The detailed exports for the two periods, since the beginning of 
the war until our entrance, and our first year in the war, with the

period from July 1, 1914 to April 1, 1917 reduced to a yearly aver- 
age, are shown in Table 1. In right-hand columns are given 
the increase or decrease in the year's exports of each commodity 
during our first year as a belligerent. These increases or decreases 
are shown both in absolute and percentage figures. 

It will be noted from the last lines of Table 1, that during our 
first year in the war, the total exports to the Western Allies were 
over 600,000,000 pounds, or 280,000 metric tons, less than the 
average for the preceding years of the war. The percentage figures 
show, however, this was a decrease of only 3.95 per cent. As will 
be shown in subsequent chapters our available food resources 
from which to ship abroad were notably low in 1917-18. 

The figures for wheat show the one really large decrease which 
is, of course, due to the small size of the 1917 crop. Wheat exports 
decreased over 68 million bushels, or 56 per cent, of the average for 
the first years of the war. 1 It is interesting to note that every other 
cereal shows an increase, rice leading with an increase of 153 million 
pounds or 4822 per cent. Wheat flour made a substantial gain of 
7 million barrels or 114 per cent. The increases and decreases were 
made in classes, all the cereals increased except wheat, all the fats 
show quite a marked decrease, as do the dried fruits. Canned beef, 
fresh beef, bacon, and hams and shoulders increased, while pickled 
beef, fresh pork and pickled pork decreased. Condensed milk 
increased over 230 million pounds, or 386 per cent. Refined sugar 
decreased 380 million pounds, or 44 per cent. Linseed oil cake 
and meal exports, which decreased after the beginning of the war, 
again show an increase in 1917-18 of about 87 million pounds, or 
211 per cent. There were no exports of corn oil from April 1, 1917 
to April 1, 1918. 

In order to show that, while the total exports of wheat to our 
Western Allies have decreased, there has been a greater degree of 
concentration, Table 2 has been prepared, which gives for different 
periods the total wheat exports to the Western Allies and to all 
other countries with their percentages of the total exports. 

1 The export figures here used are the official returns of the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Commerce. They do not include shipments to our own Expeditionary 
Forces abroad, or to certain other destinations. More detailed discussion 
of this point will be presented in a later chapter. For the present purpose, 
which is merely to give a general picture of the export situation, these in- 
complete figures will suffice.

For the last column of Table 2 it may be seen that the percentage 
of total exports of wheat to the Western Allies has been steadily 
increasing. During our first year in the war when we exported 154 
million bushels the Allies received 114 million bushels or about 
% of the entire exports. In the month of April, 1918 the United 
Kingdom, France and Italy received over 90 per cent, of all the 
wheat exported. 

Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the total exports expressed in nutritive 
units, (1) for the average of the three years preceding the war, 
(2) for the average of the period from the beginning of the war until 
our entrance, and (3) for our first year in the war.

In Fig. 2 the facts regarding the exports of essential nutrients 
since the beginning of the war are shown graphically. 

It is apparent that average rate of export of protein and of 
carbohydrates to the Western Allies from the United States in- 
creased after we beciame an active belligerent, by an amount well 
over 200 per cent, as compared with our prewar exports to these 
same countries. In the case of fat the increase is not nearly so 
great, but still notable enough if considered by itself, amounting 
to over 80 per cent, more than the prewar rate. 

These facts make apparent the necessity for taking such an 
account of stock of our food resources as this book attempts. Great 



THE FOOD PROBLEM

as this country is in its agricultural power it is not an inexhaustible 
reservoir. We have to feed something over a hundred million people 
at home out of our supply. It is obviously the part of wisdom, 
in the face of lack of knowledge as to how long the excessive demands 
on America for food may continue, to attempt to arrive at as ac- 
curate a balance sheet as possible of what we may count on in the 
way of food, and what we need for ourselves in order to keep this 
population in a sufficiently nourished and hence efficient condition. 
And it must be always remembered that for the next few years at

least now that the war has ended, the demand from Europe on 
America for food is .certain to be extremely heavy, perhaps as 
heavy as during the period of active fighting. The reconstruction 
period seems likely to be a long and painful one. Furthermore 
the neutral countries in Europe, with the cessation of hostilities 
and the lifting of embargoes, will turn perforce to America for 
the replenishment of their sadly depleted food resources. Al- 
together it is apparent that the food problem will be a very real one 
in the life of this country for several years to come. It is the 
chief purpose of this volume to contribute in some degree a critical 
physiological basis for the intelligent discussion of this problem. 



CHAPTER II 
THE PLAN 

The basis of any adequate survey of food resources must be 
essentially physiological, rather than one of commodities or trade. 
The value of foods fundamentally depends upon their content 
of nutrient materials. To get information on how much food a 
nation produces or needs for consumption, which shall be an ade- 
quate guide foir the administration of social problems such as 
those created by war, it is necessary to have something more than 
raw crop statistics. Modern research in the physiology of nutri- 
tion has shown that besides a sufficient gross amount of protein, 
fat and carbohydrate, it is necessary to have in a diet which is 
adequately to sustain an individual or a nation a certain amount 
of accessory substances, certain ones of which are generally called 
vit amines. 1 These substances are not uniformly or universally 
distributed among edible materials. Consequently an adequate 
survey of food resources must take into account not alone the 
total supplies and consumption of protein, carbohydrate and fat, 
but also the distribution of these nutrients among the several 
classes of commodities, the vitamine content of which is known, 
in general terms at least. 

So then, specifically, the problems with which this investigation 
has to do are such as these : 

1. How much protein, fat and carbohydrate is annually produced 
in the United States in forms used, or usable, as human food? 

2. How much of these basic nutrients in forms available for 
human food are imported and exported each year? 

3. What quantities of basic nutrients are annually consumed as 
human food? 

4. What is the distribution of the nutrients produced, imported, 
exported and consumed, among the several classes of food 
commodities?

for the Preservation of Vitality and Health, N. Y., 1918. 

26 



THE PLAN 27 

5. What proportion of the total nutrient material produced in 
the United States is consumed by domestic animals? 

These problems are at once physiological and social. The war 
situation made it urgently necessary to undertake their solution. 
Properly to attack these problems demanded the working out and 
application of novel methods, because the problems themselves 
are new. 

The first step obviously is to make a classification of food 
materials, so that one may effectively apply proper statistical and 
physiological methods. Broadly speaking the ultimate sources 
of food are the soil and the sun. The energy derived from the 
sun through the mechanism of the green plant builds up the in- 
organic chemical elements of the soil, air, and water, into compounds 
which can be utilized as food by man, either directly or secondarily 
in the form of the products of animals which have been nourished 
on the primary foods of the plant world. 

For the purpose of statistical analysis all nutritive materials 
produced and consumed fall into one or another of the following 
categories, which are obviously based on the considerations set 
forth in the preceding paragraph. 

I. Primary Foods 

Including all plant materials used as human food or fractions of 
such materials, and all animals or animal products in which the 
animal gets its nourishment from some source other than the pri- 
mary feeds and fodders as defined below, either 

(a) Directly as harvested, with only such sophistication as 
comes from cooking: such as, for example, potatoes, 
fish, oysters. 

(6) In derivative form, where by process of manufacture a 
food product is prepared from a raw plant product: 
such as, for example, wheat flour or cottonseed oil. 

II. Primary Feeds or Fodders 

Including all plant materials or fractions of such materials used 
for the nourishment of domestic animals, either 

(a) Directly as harvested, such as the coarse grains, or 
(6) In derivative or manufactured form, such as manufac- 
tured feeds. 



28 THE NATION'S FOOD 

III. Secondary Foods 

Including all edible products of animals used for human food, the 
animals being nourished with primary feeds and fodders. This 
rubric comprises animal foods produced, 

(a) Directly, without involving the death of the producing 
animal, such as, for example, honey, eggs, or milk, and 

( 6) Derivatively, involving the death of the animal, such as, 
for example, the meats. 

The basic idea in this classification is, of course, to allocate the nu- 
trient resources of the nation according to the usage made of them. 
We have certain products of the soil, and of the seas and fresh water 
lakes and streams, which are directly produced and directly con- 
sumed as human food. To produce a crop of potatoes or of cod 
fish or oysters it is not necessary to feed out to the growing crop some 
other crop such as hay or grain. Therefore these are direct, pri- 
mary food products. On the other hand there are many foods such 
as the meats, eggs, etc., where to obtain a pound of protein, or fat, 
or carbohydrate for human consumption it is necessary to use a 
certain amount of other protein, fat, and carbohydrate, primarily 
produced, as fodder or feed. Human food produced in this manner 
is obviously secondarily produced and cannot be allowed to count 
in the net nutritive balance sheet on the same basis as the 
primarily produced food. It is a relatively more expensive form 
of nourishment. 

It is evident that under this classification many raw food mate- 
rials will of necessity fall in part into two or more categories. For 
example, to take the case of wheat, the major part of the raw grain 
is ground into flour and as such used as human food, but in the proc- 
ess of making the flour there is produced a certain amount of feeding 
stuffs, bran, middlings, etc., which only indirectly contribute to 
human nutrition through the products of animals which eat these 
wheat feeds. Finally a certain small proportion of the wheat grain 
is fed directly as such to live stock. Similar considerations apply 
to very many other food materials. That all this adds a consider- 
able complexity to the problem is evident. But it is equally clear 
that if anything approaching reliability in the final result is to be 
attained due regard must be paid to these complicated subdivisions 
in usage of the raw food materials. Otherwise the same nutritive 



THE PLAN 29 

material will be duplicated in the accounting and a misleading result 
reached. 

The general plan of this study has been first to determine as 
accurately as possible from existing official statistics, for each year 
from 1911 to date, the amount of the basic nutrients, protein, fat, 
and carbohydrate, 

(a) produced, 
(6) imported, 
(c) exported, 

classifying the results under the main headings given above. From 
this tabulation as a base one may then proceed to calculations of 
consumption and the like. 

In making up the basic tables each commodity or derivative of 
a commodity has been listed separately and converted as such into 
nutrient values. In the matter of units of measure the following 
general plan has been followed : in all basic tables the quantities of 
production, export and import are first given in the American units 
(bushels, pounds, gallons, etc.) of the original statistics. These 
quantities are then all converted into metric tons. 1 All nutrient 
values, protein, fat, and carbohydrate, are given in metric tons. 
Energy values are expressed in millions of small calories. 2 

Regarding the sources of the basic statistics the following general 
statement may be made here, to be supplemented by more detailed 
statements in subsequent chapters where necessary. For produc- 
tion figures the fundamental sources, in the case of primary products, 
are the successive Year Books of the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture. Each volume of this publication carries as an appendix 
statistical tables giving the Department's official figures of crop 
production. A secondary source for crop production figures is 
found in the successive volumes of the Monthly Crop Report of 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Its figures are again official 
and form the basis of the tabulations of the Year Book, but fre- 
quently give more detailed information. Reliable statistics of the 
derivative products such as flour, meals, etc., are much more difficult 
to obtain than crop production figures, for the reason that they are 
not officially collected and published. In this field resort has been

30 THE NATION'S FOOD 

had to a variety of sources, such as trade papers, census returns, 
special ad hoc inquiries of manufacturers; etc. At the appropriate 
points detailed statements as to how our figures were arrived at 
will be forthcoming. 

Export and import figures are taken from the official reports 
(annual and monthly) of the foreign commerce of the United States 
compiled by the Department of Commerce. In a few cases where 
it has been clear from information available to the Food Adminis- 
tration that the official figures of the Department of Commerce were 
in error we have not hesitated to use other and, as we believe, more 
correct statistics, but in each such case specific notation of the fact 
is made. 

In the computation of nutrient values use has been made chiefly 
of the factors given by Atwater and Bryant. 1 It has been necessary, 
in some cases, to supplement their tables from data given by Leach 2 
and Henry and Morrison. 3 

All calculations in this work have been repeatedly checked 
and every possible precaution taken to guard against error. It is 
too much to hope that so extensive a piece of statistical work should 
be without errors, but I hope that their number is small and their 
net significance in the final results negligible.

CHAPTER III 

THE PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED 

STATES 

(Commodity References Nos. 1-35) 

We come now to the direct statistical analysis of food resources 
under the first rubric, the primary food materials. At the outset it 
should be understood that the tables in this and subsequent chapters 
do not include every single commodity used as food. Many 
minor and insignificant items are omitted, from necessity. There 
simply are no statistics available for such things as mushrooms, 
wild berries, game, and a large number of other subsidiary food 
items. The omissions, however, are really not a matter of concern. 
The total contribution of these omitted subsidiary items to the 
total nutritional intake of the population is statistically insignificant. 
It undoubtedly does not amount in the aggregate to as much as the 
probable error of the statistics of the staple foods. The endeavor 
has been made to include in the tables every item of food which 
fulfilled the following two requirements : (a) a significant contribu- 
tion to the national nutrition, and (6) available statistics either 
for an exact determination or a reasonable estimate. 

Table 7 gives for each year from 1911 on the production of 
all the primary food materials produced in the United States for 
which any sort of statistics could be obtained. It is necessary 
for an understanding of the tables that a precise explanation be 
given of each item. 

Before passing to this detailed discussion certain matters of 
general explanation should be presented. 

1. All years, unless otherwise specified in particular cases, are 
fiscal years beginning on July 1 of the first year named and ending 
June 30 of the second named year. This fiscal year is chosen for 
two reasons, viz.: 

(a) It is the period for which all import and export statistics 
are normally compiled by the U. S. Department of Commerce. 

(6) It includes within its limits practically the complete harvest- 
ing period of all crops grown in continental United States. 

31 



32 

2. In the columns giving nutrients, the terms protein, fat, and 
carbohydrate are used in the following senses, which are in accord 
with general usage in works on nutrition: 

(a) Protein. An arbitrary term used to designate a group of 
chemical compounds assumed to include all the nitrogenous matter 
of the food except the nitrogenous fats. It is quantitatively 
estimated by multiplying the total nitrogen found by analysis by 
the factor 6.25. 

(6) Fat. Under this term is included the total ether extract. 
The ether extract includes, besides the true fats, fatty acids, nitro- 
genous fats (lecithins), and other related compounds. 

(c) Carbohydrates. The carbohydrates include sugars, starches, 
cellulose, gums, woody fibers, etc. Carbohydrates are usually 
determined by difference in the analysis of foods. 

3. In no case is any account taken of " carry-over " in the 
production figures at this point. There is no necessity for includ- 
ing figures on " carry-over' 7 when, as in the present study, a period 
of several years in time is included in the statistical analysis. 
Under such circumstances the inclusion of carry-over or invisible 
stock estimates would simply complicate and confuse the result. 
The correct theory of the matter appears to be that in any investi- 
gation of food resources and consumption over a period of years, 
residual stocks should be regarded as having passed into consump- 
tion or export or both. This they always do sooner or later. Full 
physical proof of this fact was found in the United States in the 
summer of 1918 when the country had no appreciable residual 
stocks of certain important commodities at the end of the crop 
year. A further discussion of " carry-over " in the case of certain 
crops will be given in a later chapter. 

4. Unless otherwise specified in particular cases, use has been 
made throughout of the following general plan of determining 
nutrient values. First there are made necessary general deduc- 
tions from the total crop to cover the loss for food usage resulting 
from any or all of the following general causes : 

(a) Seed for next crop. 

(6) Loss from, failure to harvest, and incomplete harvesting, 
frost damage, and other factors lowering, in the field, the total net 
production. 

(c) Nutritional loss from plant diseases or weather injury 
which do not affect the total quantity harvested but do affect the 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 33 

food usage of the product. A good example here is anthracnose 
in beans, which diverts to lower grade food or fodder uses significant 
portions of the harvested crop. 

(d) Loss from vermin (rats, mice, etc.) and other causes in 
storage and transportation, including decay and spoilage of 
perishables. 

(e) Manufacturing losses. 

(/) Diversion to industrial, non-food uses, including the making 
of alcoholic beverages. 

Having made the best estimates possible of such general deduc- 
tions Atwater and Bryant's nutritive factors are applied to the 
residue remaining. Now these authors give, for all foods in which 
there are losses or wastage in cooking or preparation for the table, 
two sets of nutritive factors; one for the food "as purchased," 
the other for the " edible portion." In both cases the analyses 
are complete (i.e., the percentages add to 100), the percentage of 
" refuse" being put into the "as purchased" as a part of the 
analysis. In consequence one gets the same net amount of protein, 
say, in the apple crop if he applies the Atwater-Bryant " as pur- 
chased" percentage 0.3 to the weight of the whole crop, as he 
will get if he first deducts 25 per cent, from the weight of the 
crop, which is their figure for inedible refuse, and then to the 
balance left applies their "edible portion" protein factor of 0.4. 
Since the net result is the same as we have in all but one case, 
namely fish, used the "as purchased" factor on the whole crop 
remaining after the general deductions above explained. In all 
cases the amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrate given in the 
tables in this book are net amounts remaining after (a) general 
deduction for seed, crop spoilage and losses, etc., and (b) after 
allowance for refuse in preparing food as purchased for eating. 

We may now proceed to a detailed discussion of the sources, 
significance and corrections of the several items in Table 7. 

GRAINS AND THEIR DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

1. Corn Meal (Maize Meal) and Corn Flour. There are no 

official annual statistics as to the production of corn meal in this 

country. The only available data are the returns of the Census 

of Manufactures 3 made at quinquennial intervals. To arrive at 

1 The exact bibliographical reference to the last volume of the summary 
of this work is "Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914," Washington, 
1917. Detailed chapters regarding special commodities are separately issued.

34 

annual estimates the following procedure was adopted. To the 
census returns as to production of corn meal and corn flour in mer- 
chant mills for the four years 1899, 1904, 1909, 1914, a parabola was 
fitted by the method of least squares. From the fitted line annual 
figures were read off for the years up to 1917-18. In this last year 
there has been such a marked and abnormal increase in the corn 
milling capacity of the country that another procedure was adopted 
to reach an estimate. For the first six months of 'the year (July, 
1917 to December, 1917, inclusive) the value was estimated from the 
parabola. For the last six months (January to June, 1918, inclusive) 
the total rated capacity of existing and operating merchant corn 
mills was taken, on the assumption that under the present stress 
of need the mills were operating to full capacity. 

The procedure so far gave the production of corn meal in mer- 
chant mills only. More than in the case of any other grain, corn 
is custom ground. The farmer takes his grain to the mill and pays 
the miller to turn it into meal. The amount of such custom milling 
of corn is too great to neglect. It has, however, been steadily 
decreasing, at least since 1899. In that year 30.5 per cent, of the 
total output of corn meal in the country was ground in custom mills. 
In 1909 this percentage had dropped to 20.7. We have assumed 
that it has continued to decrease at the same rate since that time, 
and have accordingly applied a sliding scale increase to the merchant 
mill output relative to the custom mill to get the total. 

2. Hominy and Grits as Corn. Again there are no official an- 
nual statistics of production, so that recourse was had to the quin- 
quennial returns of the Census of Manufactures. To the figures 
of output of hominy in merchant mills (in terms of bushels of corn 
used in the manufacture of this product) for the years 1904,1909, 
1914 a straight line was fitted by the method of least squares, and the 
values read off for individual years, and by extrapolation after 
1914. There appeared to be no sufficient ground for differential 
treatment of the year 1917-18 in respect of this commodity. Also 
no correction has been made for manufacture of this product in 
custom mills. In 1909 only approximately 1 per cent, of the total 
was so made, and the proportion was decreasing rapidly. 

3. Wheat (Nutrients in Flour). The basis for the computation 
here was the official statistics as to the wheat crop in successive 
years as given by the Department of Agriculture. For the years 
1911-12 to 1915-16 the crop figures were taken from the U. S. 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 35 

Department of Agriculture Yearbook 1 for 1916, p. 571. For the 
year 1916-17 the crop figure was taken from the Monthly Crop 
Report 2 (U. S. Department of Agriculture) for December, 1917, 
p. 117. For the year 1917-18 the Food Administra'tion estimate 
of the wheat crop, based on its marketing statistics was used. 

Starting with the total crop figures the following deductions 
were made in order to arrive at the net amount available for human 
consumption: (a) the amount used for seed, determined on the 
basis of acreage and the average amount per acre used for seeding 
purposes in the different states; (6) 5 per cent, of the crop to cover 
wastage in storage and transit, loss by vermin, etc.; (c) 2 per cent, 
of the crop to allow for the amount fed to live stock direct. This 
last item, of course, is included later in the computations of fodder 
and feed, but in the present chapter we are dealing strictly with 
human food. The proportion of 2 per cent, of the crop so used is 
the Department of Agriculture's average estimate on the point. 
(d) The amount used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages. 
This is an extremely small item, amounting to an annual per capita 
consumption of less than 0.006 lb., all of which was stopped during 
our participation in the war owing to the closing of distilleries. 

No deduction is made for industrial non-food or non-fodder uses 
of wheat for the reason that the amount of such use is so insignifi- 
cantly small that anything approaching an accurate estimate is 
utterly impossible. The 5 per cent, general deduction for loss may 
probably be safely regarded as also including any non-food uses 
other than those already allowed for. 

Having made the above mentioned deductions it is assumed that 
the balance remaining is ground into flour and feeds. In Table 
7 the nutrients of the flour fraction of the balance are set down. 

Considerable thought and study has been given as to whether 
a different set of factors for the calculation of the nutrients in the 
flour should not be used for the year 1917-18 in view of the milling 
regulations which required, during the major portion of that year, 
a higher milling extraction of the wheat as flour than had prevailed 
before. It has finally been decided to use the same analytical 
factors for this as other years, because investigation showed that 
the new flour was so nearly identical in chemical composition with 
the old as not to make it worth while to take a different basis of 

1 Hereafter this publication will be referred to by the initials D.A.Y.B. 

2 Hereafter this publication will be referred to by the initials M.C.R. 



36 THE NATION'S FOOD 

computation so far as concerns analysis. We have, of course, made 
allowance for the higher quantitative extraction of the berry to 
flour in 1917-18. 

It might at first thought be supposed that separate account 
should be taken of wheat used in breakfast foods. Consideration 
will, however, make it apparent that this is ndt necessary in the 
method here followed, because we have included as flour all the 
Wheat which goes into these products, in our method of calculation. 
The only possible criticism which could be made on this point 
would be that the nutritive value of these breakfast foods is dif- 
ferent from flour. The difference, however, is so small, and the 
total amount of wheat which goes into these products is so small 
as compared with what is consumed as flour that no statistically 
significant error is introduced by the method here used. 

4. Oatmeal. This item includes rolled oats and all other 
products of oats used as human food as well as oatmeal in the strict 
sense. There being no official statistics on the production of these 
commodities the data were collected ad hoc by the Statistical 
Division of the Food Administration from the Oat Millers' As- 
sociation. Oatmeal being a derivative product used practically 
only as human food the whole output has been converted into 
nutrient values. 

5. Barley Meal. This rubric includes all products of barley 
used as human food. The production of barley flour, which is a 
new product in the United States manufactured in commercial 
quantities for general consumption (other than as baby food) 
only during very recent years, has become in that year a very 
significant item. The returns for the production of barley flour 
we have from the Milling Division of the Food Adminstration 
for a portion of the year 1917-18 and have made an estimate for 
the whole year's production from the known data. There being 
no official annual figures on the production of milled barley prod- 
ucts resort has been had again to the quinquennial returns of 
the Census of Manufactures and a straight line fitted by least 
squares to the production figures there given for the years 1909 
and 1914, and the estimated production of individual years read 
off the line, except in the case of 1917-18 as above explained. The 
barley products here dealt with being derivative products, used 
for human food only, the total production has been converted to 
nutrient values. 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 37 

6. Rye Flour. The same procedure and sources to arrive at 
annual estimates of production were adopted here as in the case 
of barley meal. 

7. Buckwheat Flour. The same procedure and sources were 
used for this commodity as for rye flour and barley meal and flour, 
except that in the case of buckwheat flour there appeared to be no 
good reason for any differential treatment of the year 1917-18. 

8. Rice. The crop figures, in terms of cleaned rice, were taken 
for the year 1911-12 and 1912-13 from D.A.Y.B., 1914, p. 590; 
for the years 1913-14 to 1915-16 inclusive from D.A.Y.B., 1916, 
p. 607; and for 1916-17 and 1917-18 from M.C.R., December, 
1917, p. 117. From the total crop was deducted (a) 5 per cent, 
of the crop for wastage and spoilage, (&) the amount used as 
seed, and (c) the amount used in the manufacture of alcoholic 
beverages. The residue after these deductions was converted to 
nutrient values. 

VEGETABLES 

9. Beans. Official estimates of the bean crop have been pub- 
lished by the Department of Agriculture only since 1914-15. 
In the years before that no data whatever were available. The 
figure for 1915-16 (M.C.R., Sept., 1916, p. 89) was for the 5 prin- 
cipal bean growing states only, New York, Michigan, Colorado, 
New Mexico, California. In later years returns from an additional 
state, Arizona, have been included. The figures given include, how- 
ever, practically the whole of the commerical crop. The 1915-16 
figure is from M.C.R., December, 1917, p. 127, and those for 
1916-17 and 1917-18, ibid., p. 117. For the years prior to 1914 
we have estimated annual production figures to a rough approxima- 
tion, on the general assumption that there has been no very violent 
change in bean husbandry as to acreage planted, methods of 
cultivation, or yield during the last 10 years, and that therefore 
the crops during the past 4 years make possible an approximate 
estimate for the three preceding years. 

In all cases there has been made a deduction of one-fourth of 
the total crop before converting to nutrients, to allow fdr (a) seed 
and (6) wastage and spoilage in handling and storage, including 
effects of disease on nutritive values and usage, etc. 

10. Peas (Other Than Canned). The pea crop in the United 
States harvested as dry grain, as distinct from that harvested 
green for canning, is not large. Unfortunately the Department 



38 THE NATION'S FOOD 

of Agriculture until very recently has never collected statistics as 
to its amount. Consequently in order to get at any approximation 
to the amount of this commodity available for human food we 
are forced to make the best estimate possible from the published 
data for two years only. In M.C.R., May, 1918, p. 51, figures 
are given for the edible dried pea production in the five important 
producing states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Idaho, Washington, and 
Colorado, for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18. These sta'tes cover 
practically the whole of the commercial crop. Working from 
these figures and census returns as a basis, estimates have been 
made for the other years. In each case one-fourth of the estimated 
crop has been deducted for seed and losses in storage and handling. 
This deduction might seem large, at first thought, but it must be 
remembered that a fair proportion of the dried pea crop goes as 
seed for the green pea crop used in canning. 

11. Potatoes. The basic statistics for potato production were 
derived from the following sources: 1911-12 to 1915-16 inclusive 
D.A.Y.B., 1916, p. 614; 1916-17 and 1917-18, M.C.R., December, 
1917, p. 117. From the figures as given in these sources we have 
deducted one-third of the crop in each year to allow for (a) seed 
and (6) spoilage and wastage. The residual values are then con- 
verted to nutrients. 

12. Sweet Potatoes. The crop statistics for sweet potatoes are 
given in D.A.Y.B., 1916, p. 617, for the years 1911-12 to 1916-17, 
inclusive. For 1917-18 the figure was taken from M.C.R., De- 
cember, 1917, p. 117. A deduction of one-third of the crop is 
made in each year to allow for seed and spoilage and wastage 
in handling. The residue is converted to nutrient values. 

13. Onions. Statistics on the onion crop were first published 
by the Department of Agriculture for the year 1914r-15. The 
sources of the data for that and following years afre: 1914-15, 
M.C.R., November, 1915, p. 73; 1915-16, ibid., August, 1916, p. 80; 
1916-17 and 1917-18, ibid. t December, 1917, p. 117. The returns 
are for 13 states (12 in 1914-15) only, but cover practically the 
whole of the commercial crop. The crop of onions is highly variable 
in amount if one may judge from the four years for which figures 
are available. This makes estimating the crop of the missing 
years very difficult. The crops of the missing years, however, 
probably did not deviate far from the average of the four years 
for which data are available. On this basis, conservative estimates, 
erring almost surely in the direction of under-statement, have been 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 39 

made for the three years 1911-12 to 1913-14, inclusive. In all 
cases a deduction of one-fourth of the crop has been made to allow 
.for spoilage, loss in storage and transit, etc. 

14. Cabbage. Cabbage crop statistics were started by the 
Department of Agriculture first for the year 1914-15. The figures 
for that year are given in M.C.R., November, 1915, p. 73. For the 
year 1915-16 the reference is M.C.R., September, 1916, p. 92. 
The data for the last two years are given in M.C.R., December, 
1917, p. 117. The statistics are for the crop produced in nine 
states, but cover practically the whole of the commercial crop. 
Before calculating the nutrients one-third of the estimated crop 
for each year is deducted for loss in storage and handling. On 
the basis of existing information for the last four years the three 
preceding years have been estimated. 

15. Canned Peas. The statistics for the production of canned 
peas were taken from "The Canning Trade Almanac of the Canning 
Industry, 1918 " for the years 1911-12 to 1916-17, inclusive. The 
statistics are collected by the National Canners' Association under 
the personal supervision of the Secretary, Mr. Frank Gorrell. 
For the last year the production was reported to the Statistical 
Division of the Food Administration by each canner, and the 
statistics compiled by that Division. No deductions were made 
from the total production figures in calculating the nutrients. 
It should be understood that the canned pea pack does not nutrition- 
ally duplicate anything in the item " Dried Peas" given above. 
They are a separate and distinct production. 

16. Canned Corn. The sources and method of handling the data 
were precisely the same for canned corn as for canned peas above. 

17. Canned Tomatoes. The sources and method of handling 
the data were the same for this commodity as for canned peas and 
canned corn. 

SACCHARINE MATERIALS 

18. Beet Sugar. This item includes the best sugar produced 
in the continental area of the United States. The sources of the 
statistics are as follows: for the years 1911-12 to 1915-16, in- 
clusive, D.A.Y.B., 1916, p. 643; 1916-17 and 1917-18, M.C.R., 
July, 1918, p. 76. No deductions are made from this item in con- 
verting to nutrients. The carbohydrate content is taken as 100 
per cent. 

19. Domestic Cane Sugar. This item includes the Louisiana 
cane sugars. It is given as a separate item because the carbohydrate 



40 THE NATION'S FOOD 

content of these sugars is less than 100 per cent. We have taken as 
a fair average carbohydrate content for all these sugars 95 per cent. 
No deduction from the production is made in calculating the nutri 
ents. The source of the statistics isfor the years 1911-12 to 1916-17, 
inclusive, M.C.R., May, 1917, p. 42; for 1917-18, Willett and Gray's 
Weekly Statistical Sugar Trade Journal, March 21, 1918, p. 128. 

20. Molasses. This item includes the molasses produced in the 
United States from sugars from the following sources: U. S. Cane, 
U. S. Beet, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and Cuba. The imports of sugar 
from the last three sources are computed in Chapter VI as refined 
sugar, and hence in counting the molasses as domestic production 
(which it is in the sense that it is made here) we are making no 
nutritional duplication. Molasses varies greatly in its sucrose con- 
tent. As a fair general average we have taken the carbohydrate 
content of all molasses at 65 per cent. This is conservative, as 
At water and Bryant (p. 64) give the average as 69.3. We have 
lowered this because of Leach's (p. 568) data based on a larger 
number of analyses, showing a greater range of variation and a 
lower minimum value. (See also Henry and Morrison, p. 637.) 
Molasses is stated to have a " protein" content of from 2 to 4 
per cent. Really, however, this is chiefly nitrogenous material 
not nutritionally available. Henry and Morrison (p. 186) say, 
regarding this point: "The crude protein of both beet and cane 
molasses consists largely of compounds having little nutritive value." 
It appears ridiculous in face of these facts to include the fairly 
large number of tons of protein which would result from applying 
the At water-Bryant factor to the total molasses production. We 
have accordingly called the protein and fat content of molasses 
zero. This gives a fuel value per pound of 1209 calories. 

The statistics of production used were compiled by Mr. Joshua 
Bernhardt, the sugar statistician of the Statistical Division of the 
Food Administration, from information from a variety of trade and 
technical sources, and from Department of Agricultural figures. 
The really difficult problem with molasses is the proper allocation 
of the total crop between the following general classes of use, 
(a) human food, (b) stock feed, (c) industrial alcohol. On this 
point the advice of Dr. C. L. Alsberg, Chief of the Bureau of Chem- 
istry of the Department of Agriculture, of Mr. George M. Rolph, 
Head of the Sugar Division of the Food Administration, and Dr. 
William Marshall, Controller of the International Sugar Committee, 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 41 

has been obtained. The net result of our investigation of the matter 
is embodied in the following percentage allocation scheme, which 
has been made the basis of the deductions in the molasses item in 
Table 7.

21. Glucose and Grape Sugar. The figures on the production of 
liquid glucose and grape sugar were arrived at from information 
given in the Census of Manufactures and from a special question- 
naire sent to glucose manufacturers at the request of the writer 
by Mr. George S. Mahana of New York. On this basis of infor- 
mation obtained from the manufacturers as to their sales, 4 per 
cent, of the production in each year was deducted for non-food 
industrial uses. An average carbohydrate content of 85 per cent, 
was. assumed in the conversion to nutrient values. 

22. Honey. There are no official statistics of honey production. 
Dr. E. F. Phillips of the Bureau of Entomology of the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, who has for many years been in charge of 
agricultural investigations, estimates that during the period covered 
by the present study 250,000,000 Ib. fairly estimates the average 
annual production. We have accordingly adoptedj this figure. 
No deductions are made. 

23. Sorghum Syrup. This commodity is rather extensively used 
in the South as a sweetening agent. The production figures are 
from M.C.R., October, 1916, p. 102, for the years 1911-12 to 1915- 
16, inclusive, and from M.C.R., December, 1917, p. 117. The 
average carbohydrate content, as furnished by the Bureau of 
Chemistry, is 68.1 per cent. 

24. Maple Sugar. Statistics are available only for the census 
year, 1909, and for the years 1917-18 and 1918-19 (M.C.R., June, 
1918, p. 61). From these data estimates have been made for the 
other years. No deductions have been made. 

25. Maple Syrup. The sources and treatment are the same as for 
maple sugar. 



42 

FRUITS 

26. Apples. The production statistics for apples were taken, 
for the years 1911-12 to 1915-16, inclusive, from D.A.Y.B., 1916, 
p. 635; for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18 from M.C.R., December, 
1917, p. 117. Before calculating nutrient values one-third of the 
crop in each year was deducted for wastage and spoilage. 

27. Peaches.- The statistics of production for this crop were 
taken from D.A.Y.B., 1916, p. 637, for the years 1911-12 and 1915- 
16, inclusive, and for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18 from M.C.R., 
December, 1917, p. 117. A deduction of one-third of the crop was 
made for spoilage and wastage. 

28. Pears. Statistics on the production of pears were only 
started by the Department of Agriculture in 1914-15. For that 
year the data were taken from M.C.R., November, 1915, p. 65; 
for the year 1915-16 from M.C.R., August, 1916, p. 80; and for 
the last two years from M.C.R., December, 1917, p. 117. The 
production in the years prior to 1914-15 was estimated from a fitted 
straight line. In each year one-third of the crop was deducted 
for wastage and spoilage. 

29. Oranges. Official statistics on the commercial production of 
oranges begin only in 1916-17 and were taken from M.C.R., 
December, 1917, p. 117. The production in earlier years has been 
estimated on the basis of the two known years and census returns 
in 1909. One-fifth of the crop is deducted for spoilage and wastage. 
It should be remembered that we are dealing here with statistics 
of a commercial pack and not with a total crop as in apples, some 
of which never even harvested, and consequently it is proper 
to make a smaller deduction than in the other fruits. 

29a. Prunes. The statistics of production of this, and the two fol- 
lowing dried fruit crops, are taken from the California Annual, Vol. 2, 
No. 1, June 15, 1918. This is a publication of the California Packing 
Corporation. While the figures are trade rather than official 
estimates they are probably as accurate as other crop estimates. 
In any case they are the only data available on these crops. 

296. Raisins. 

29c. Apricots, dried. 

VEGETABLE OILS AND NUTS 

Here we shall include as oils only cottonseed, corn, cocoanut, and 
olive oils. The other vegetable oils produced in this country are too 
small in amount in respect of human food use to be significant 
and detailed statistics regarding such minor items are largely 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STAPES 43 

lacking. Furthermore it is possible to take account of the more 
important of them by the procedure followed with peanuts, where 
the fat content of the original crop is counted. It would be im- 
possible accurately to divide the fat content of the peanut crop 
between peanuts as such and expressed oil, because of lack of suf- 
ficiently accurate and detailed statistics. But such procedure is 
wholly unnecessary because the whole fat content is accounted for 
by the method here used. 

Other than the direct consumption as oil, the chief forms in 
in which vegetable oils and fats are consumed as food in this country 
are oleomargarine and lard substitutes. Oleomargarine is carried 
as a separate item under Secondary Foods (cf. Chapter IV) and 
in the duplication of cottonseed and cocoanut oils which is thus 
brought about there is a safe allowance for the unenumerated minor 
oils. The chief vegetable oils used in lard substitutes are cottonseed, 
corn, and peanut oils, all of which are fully counted here. 

30. Peanuts. Peanuts constitute the only nut crop sufficient 
in magnitude to be significant in the nutritional sense. Official 
statistics on this crop have only been published by the Department 
of Agriculture during the past two years (M.C.R., December, 1917, 
p. 126) . Before that time only census data are available. We have 
made estimates for the earlier years, on the assumption that the 
increase in the peanut crop was evenly distributed in time prior 
to 1916. In all cases 15 per cent, of the crop is deducted for seed 
and loss in harvesting, storage, and handling. 

The distribution of the nutrient value of the peanut crop presents 
a difficult problem. Of the portion of the peanut crop actually 
harvested as grain, which is what the statistics here given refer to, 
comparatively little is fed to livestock, 1 though a large proportion 
of the crop as grown is so fed. 

The Fat and Oil Survey of the U. S. Food Administration 
furnishes figures on the peanut oil production. Working back 
from these figures the portion of the crop pressed for oil has been 
calculated. From this fraction of the crop there goes to human 
nutrition 75 per cent, of the fat content (data from Fat and Oil 
Survey) and none of the protein or carbohydrate. Of the balance of 
the harvested crop we have estimated that 90 per cent, of all the 
nutrient material goes to human food, and 10 per cent, to fodder. 
The nutrients, as they appear in Table 7, have been calculated on 

1 As we are informed by a practical Southern farmer of wide experience. 



44 THE NATION'S FOOD 

this basis. It is obvious that these are rough estimates, but it 
seems impossible to get more accurate information. 

In the matter of analysis difficulty was experienced because 
of the wide discrepancies between published figures. Atwater and 
Bryant (p. 75) give a fat content of the whole nut, as purchased, of 
29.1 per cent. This is obviously too low, as is evident from known 
facts as to the yield of peanut oil in crushing. Generally speaking 
the yield is 40 to 50 Ib. of oil per 100 Ib. shelled nuts. 1 Atwater 
and Bryant give the inedible refuse (shells) as 24.5 per cent, of total 
weight. It is then clear that nothing like the actual oil recoveries 
could be got from this 29.1 per cent. After thorough study of all 
the available analyses it has been decided to use throughout this book, 
the following figures for the nutrient content of whole peanuts 
with shell (unhulled) as purchased. 

Protein 19.5 per cent. 

Fat 33.2 per cent. 

Carbohydrate 14.4 per cent. 

These figures correspond to a commercial oil yield of 40 Ib. 
per 100 Ib. of peanuts with hulls removed, which is conservative. 

31. Cottonseed Oil. The basic statistics were the production 
of crude oil in each year as given in " Cotton Production and Dis- 
tribution, Season of 1916-17" (Bureau of the Census, Bulletin 
135, 1918), for all the years up to 1917-18. In this last year the 
total production was estimated from the known production to 
June 30, 1918. The crop year for cottonseed oil is from August 1 
to July 31, inclusive. From the total crude oil produced was 
deducted in each year the amount used for non-food industrial 
purposes, chiefly soap-making. The balance remaining was 
converted to refined oil and the nutrient values calculated. The 
deductions for industrial uses were made on the basis of information 
contained in the Fat and Oil Survey. 

32. Corn Oil.- The only available statistics on this product are 
given in the Census of Manufactures at quinquennial periods. 
A straight line was fitted by least squares to the 1909 and 1914 data 
and the other years read off from this line. The Fat and Oil 
Survey indicates that there is no appreciable quantity of refined 
corn oil used for non-food purposes, and therefore no deductions are 
made from the total production of refined oil here given.

Also Armsby, H. P., "The Conservation of Food Energy," Philadelphia, 
1918, p. 52. 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 45 

33. Cocoanut Oil. This is a product which has been manufac- 
tured in this country for edible purposes only in recent years. 
The figures for production were obtained from the Food Administra- 
tion's Fat and Oil Survey and from the Bureau of Chemistry 
of the Department of Agriculture. Only the edible oil is taken 
account of. The much larger portion of the total production 
used for non-food industrial purposes is not included here. 

34. Olive Oil. The statistics for this commodity are derived 
from the Fat and Oil Survey of the U. S. Food Administration. 
Only the edible oil production is taken, and therefore no deduction 
is made for industrial uses. 

FISH 

35. Fish. There are no official statistics as to the total catch 
of fish in this country. I have accordingly asked the U. S. Bureau 
of Fisheries to help in arriving at an estimate in this matter. After 
careful consideration they state that during the years covered by 
this study the best estimate they can make is that the average annual 
catch amounted to 2,000,000,000 lb., including all salt and fresh 
water fish, shell fish, etc., privately caught and locally consumed, as 
well as commercially caught. The figure also includes all canned 
fish. 

In arriving at nutritional figures for this lump catch, it has seemed 
advisable to work with the edible portions only, deducting the 
refuse at one operation. For twenty-five leading varieties of fish 
and shellfish Atwater and Bryant's figures yield an average refuse 
percentage of 48.184. We have accordingly reduced the 2,000,000,- 
000 lb. gross catch by this percentage. For the same twenty-five 
varieties we have determined the average analytical results for 
edible portion, as given by Atwater and Bryant, with the following 
results. 

Protein 17.2 per cent. 

Fat 3.9 per cent. 

Calories 497 per lb. 

These factors have been applied to the figures as given. 

Table 6 gives in detail the conversion factors used. Since in 
this study conversions were first made to short tons of 2000 lb. 
the table is presented in that form. The results were then con- 
verted to metric tons by multiplying by the factor 0.9072.

* These conversion factors for wheat flour were used for all years except 1917-18. In that 
year, on account of the higher milling extraction, the factors became: Protein = 0.002531, fat = 
0.000222, carbohydrate = 0.016672, calories = 0.073309. 

** See text, p. 43, for treatment of peanut crop. The factors here given relate only to whole 
peanuts and are 90 per cent, of total nutrient values. 

** Calories calculated from final total nutrients as given in Table 7. 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 



We come now to the consideration of Table 7 which gives the detailed 
results for primary foods.

THE NATION S FOOD 



It is not proposed to enter upon any detailed discussion of the 
results shown in Table 7 until certain other data are in hand, 
because to do so would inevitably involve unnecessary duplication. 
Here it is desirable only to summarize in convenient form for reference 
the data of Table 7. This is done in Table 8.

The data of Table 8 are shown graphically in Fig. 3. 

From the summary and Fig. 3 we note : first of all, that while the 
total production of primary foods generally increased up to the 
year 1915-16 it fell off badly in the two following years, 1916-17 
and 1917-18, going back in 1916-17 to practically the level of the 
earliest of the prewar years here discussed. The yearly fluctua- 
tions are, however, much less violent in the nutrients than in the 
gross totals of commodities. This can best be demonstrated by 
reducing the figures of Table 8 to a relative basis, by taking the 
average of the whole period as 100, for each column, and then 
reducing each year figure to that relative base. This is done in 
Table 9. 

The much smoother increase in the nutrients to the high point 
in 1915-16, as compared with the gross commodity total is apparent. 

Protein shows the greatest percentage change, the production 
having increased 42 per cent, from 1911-12 to 1915-16. It also

suffered most in the slump of 1916-17, dropping back 40. per cent, 
in one year from its highest point. The increase in calories amounts 
to 35 per cent. The greatest increase in fat production was from 
1912-13 to 1914-15, amounting to 18 per cent., less than half of 
the increase in protein production. One might think that all the 
nutrients ought to change proportionately to each other and to the 
total crop. Thus it may puzzle one at first thought to under- 
stand why the nutrient production was higher for all three in 
1913-14 than in 1912-13, while the total production of primary 
foods as commodity was 6 per cent, lower in 1913-14 than in 1912- 
13. The explanation for the apparent paradox is seen to be simple 
by examination of the separate items in Table 7. In 1913-14 
the vegetables and fruits gave generally a lower production than in 
the previous year. But the grains were higher, and also the sugars 
and fats. Thus, while the decrease in the fruits and vegetables 
was sufficient to bring about a decrease in gross tonnage, the higher 
nutrient content of grains, fats, and sugars turned the nutrient 
scale the other way. 

The year 1917-18 was below the general average of the whole 
period in all items of primary nutrient production except fat. 
The stimulation of high prices to the producer and great demand 
for vegetable oils, and the response of the people of the country to 
the request of the Food Administration to eat more corn meal re- 
sulted in a notable increase in the net production of nutrient fat 
in the form of primary foods during the past year. The result 
is of great significance as indicating the possibilities of fat pro- 
duction from vegetable sources in this country under stress of 
necessity. To go into the matter a little more closely, it is seen 
that the total production of primary foods in 1917-18 was 1,113,974 
metric tons lower than in 1912-13, a decrease of approximately 
3 per cent. But in 1917-18 the net nutrient fat produced in the 
primary foods for human food uses was 113,274 metric tons higher 
than that produced in 1912-13. It thus appears in comparing 
these two years that with a 3 per cent, smaller total primary food 
production, there was a 12 per cent, greater production of net 
nutrient fat from the primary foods. Even this certainly does not 
represent the extent to which we might go, in dire necessity, in 
speeding up and extending the manufacturing processes which 
make available for human food the fat content of the primary 
crops. 



PRIMARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 57 

With a single exception, 1917-18 shows the highest production 
of fat. The exception is 1914-15, when the cottonseed oil produc- 
tion was very high owing to a bumper cotton crop and brought 
up the total. 

The last line of Table 8 is of interest in showing the net per- 
centage nutrient content of all primary foods over the whole seven 
year period. From this line it is seen that, after making all due de- 
ductions for seed, invisible loss, etc., the net percentage of protein 
in the primary foods was 5.5, of fat 2.6 and of carbohydrate 41.4, 
with a fuel value of 985 calories to the pound. It should be under- 
stood that these percentages are net. Besides the general deduc- 
tions from the commodities as explained above, allowance was 
made in calculating the nutrients for inedible refuse in preparing 
the foods for the table. Putting all the nutrients together it 
appears that of the net tonnage of primary food commodities 
produced in this country for human consumption only 49.5 per cent, 
has direct true nutrient value. The remaining 50.5 per cent, 
represents (a) water, (6) inedible refuse, and (c) ash. 

The relation of the different primary food commodities to the 
total production of nutrients will be discussed in a later chapter. 



CHAPTER IV 

THE SECONDARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED 

STATES 

(Commodity References Nos. 36-48) 

In this chapter will be considered the production of the remain- 
ing materials used as human food in addition to the primary foods 
listed in Chapter III. Here again there are of necessity minor 
omissions, and in some cases we have had to resort to estimates 
because of lack of statistics. No account is taken of the production 
of meats through game, goats, rabbits or horses. None of these 
items is of any statistical significance in the nutrition of this nation, 
though in certain foreign countries each of them assumes some 
importance. Here it would be impossible to include these items 
in any case because of lack of information. 

Just as in Chapter III it will be necessary to give a detailed ex- 
planation of how the figures on each item were obtained. The 
reference numbers to items will continue serially from those in 
Chapter III. 

In Table 1 1 are given data as to the domestic production of the 
following commodities: 

MEATS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

36. Beef. The data here include the total production of what 
is technically known as carcass beef. This means the meat and fat 
of the dressed carcass. This item does not include (a) the visceral 
fat, from which oleo oil is made and which is accounted separately 
for in the oleomargarine and in the oleo oil produced for export, 
or (6) the edible offal, liver, tongue, etc. 

To arrive at total production the starting point was the statistics 
of slaughter of cattle under federal inspection, published by the 
Bureau of Animal Industry of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
It was assumed that the percentage of inspected slaughter to the 
total slaughter in the whole country was the same as that found 
at the last census (56.39 per cent.) for all years up to 1916-17. 
It is known that during the past two years there has been a marked 

58 



SECONDABY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 59 

change in this percentage. After careful consideration the follow- 
ing estimates were made : 

Year Percentage of inspected 

slaughter to total 

1916-17 63 

1917-18 72 

The number of animals slaughtered, as above calculated, was 
then multiplied by the average live weight per animal for the same 
year, as determined at the Chicago packing establishments. 1 
This gave the total live weight slaughtered. There may be some 
criticism of using Chicago average live weights rather than those 
from some other point or points but, on the whole, it seemed wisest 
to use the Chicago figures for the reason that it is the largest market 
and, over a period of' years such as we are here dealing with, 
probably the most representative. Having arrived at total live 
weight figures 52.5 per cent, of these was taken as representing 
dressed weight. 

In obtaining the nutritive values Atwater and Bryant's (p. 28) 
figures for " Sides, All analyses" were used, taking the "As pur- 
chased" values, which as already explained (p. 33) make allowance 
for inedible refuse as a part of the analysis. 

37. Edible Offal from Cattle. In obtaining the edible offal figures 
2.9 per cent, of the live weight as given under Reference No. 36 was 
taken to represent the production of these products. This per- 
centage figure was calculated from data reported by the packers. 

To obtain the nutritive value of the edible offal Atwater and 
Bryant's figures for the following organs were averaged: brain, 
heart, kidneys, lungs, marrow, sweetbreads, suet and tongue. In 
making the average each organ was allowed to count roughly in 
proportion to its weight. The final weighted average analysis 
of beef offal "as purchased" was as follows:. 

Protein 16 . per cent. 

Fat 14.9 per cent. 

Carbohydrate 1.0 per cent. 

Calories 945 per Ib. 

The carbohydrate is, of course, glycogen in the livers. 

1 1 wish to acknowledge my great indebtedness to the various Chicago 
packers, particularly Armour & Co., for furnishing much needed data on 
various points connected with this analysis of meat production. For many 
points no official statistics are either collected or published, and the books of 
the packers are the only source of information. 



60 THE NATION'S FOOD 

38. Veal. In principle the method of arriving at production 
figures for veal was the same as that used for beef. Starting with 
inspected slaughter the census percentage of 33.46 per cent, in- 
spected to total slaughter was applied for all years up to 1916-17. 
For 1916-17 a percentage of 45 was assumed, and for 1917-18 a 
percentage of 50. The number of animals slaughtered, as above 
determined, was multiplied by the average Chicago live weight 
for each year. The percentage of dressed weight to live weight 
was taken at 62.11 per cent. The analytical figures for sides as 
purchased were used. 

39. Edible Offal from Calves. The edible offal for calves was 
taken at 5.23 per cent, of the live weight on the basis of packers' 
reports. The nutritive values of the offal were computed on the 
same plan as that employed for beef edible offal, with the following 
weighted average analytical results : 

Protein 17.3 per cent. 

Fat 6 . 1 per cent. 

Carbohydrate 0.0 per cent. 

Calories 576 per Ib. 

40. Pork and Lard. Here the percentage of inspected to total 
slaughter is taken for all years at 58.86 per cent, there being no 
evidence of any significant change in this respect in recent years. 
The average percentage of dressed weight to live weight is taken 
at 71.97 per cent, for all years, on the basis of packers' reports. 
This dressed weight percentage includes the lard produced from the 
carcass, along with the pork, so that lard is not set down as a sepa- 
rate item in Table 11. The analytical figures used were those for 
"Side, lard and other fat included as purchased" (Atwater & 
Bryant, p. 39). 

41. Edible Offal from Hogs. Packers' reports indicate the 
edible offal to be 5.559 per cent, of the live weight. This figure was 
accordingly used. For the analytical constants we have again 
made a weighted average of the organs included, with the following 
results : 

Protein 18 . 4 per cent. 

Fat 8 . 8 per cent. 

Carbohydrate 0.8 per cent. 

Calories 732 per Ib. 



SECONDARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 61 

42. Mutton and Lamb. Here the percentage of inspected to 
total slaughter is taken at 76.95 for all years. On account of the 
inclusion here in one group of old and young animals it was thought 
desirable to get the dressed weight in a different manner than in the 
other cases. Through the kindness of Armour & Co., we were able 
to get average absolute dressed weights from all their plants and 
these absolute weights were applied to total slaughter. The analy- 
tical figures used were for sides as purchased, including tallow. 

43. Edible Offal from Sheep and Lambs. The percentage of 
edible offal here, from packers' reports, is 2.77 per cent, of the live 
weight. The weighted average analytical constants used are: 

Protein 19.8 per cent. 

Fat 8 . 9 per cent. 

Carbohydrate 2.8 per cent. 

Calories 796 per Ib. 

44. Oleomargarine. The statistics on the production of oleo- 
margarine were obtained from the " Annual Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Internal Revenue for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 
1917" (p. 150) for all years up to 1917-18. The production for 
1917-18 was estimated on the basis of monthly returns from the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue through April, 1918. 

As already explained (p. 43 supra) this item involves some nu- 
tritional duplication, in respect of the vegetable oils which oleomar- 
garine contains. This duplication is allowed to stand in order to 
correct in the total for the omission of minor vegetable oils from the 
primary foods. 

45. Oleo Oil for Export. This item is inserted here as well as 
in the export table on the following reasoning. Oleo oil is made from 
the visceral and caul fat of beef, which is not included in the dressed 
weight of beef in Table 11. That portion of the oleo oil which is 
domestically consumed is used in making oleomargarine and its 
production is accounted for in Item 44 above. But if we did not 
insert here the oleo oil which is exported as such, we should be short 
on the production side of the ledger by just that amount. It is not 
an insignificant item, and therefore it has been inserted here. The 
data are from the successive numbers of the Monthly Summary of 
Foreign Commerce issued by the Department of Commerce. The 
same item appears unchanged in Table 37, Chapter VII, among 
other exports. 



62 THE NATION'S FOOD 

POULTRY AND EGGS 

46. Poultry. Unfortunately there are no annual statistics as 
to either amount of poultry on farms, or production of poultry. 
Consequently we have had to estimate this item. This has been 
done after consultation with the Animal Husbandry Division of 
the Department of Agriculture. The best that can be done is an 
estimate of the annual production of all sorts of poultry. The 
values given are arrived at partly from Census figures and partly 
from an assumed annual increase, accompanying the increasing 
population of the country and the steady and intensive propaganda 
on the part of the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural 
Experiment Stations, and the Colleges of Agriculture for more and 
better poultry. 

An average live weight of 3 Ib. per head is assumed. This 
seems reasonable when it is remembered that the total includes 
everything from turkeys and geese to broiler chicks. 

Because of the heterogeneous inclusiveness of the item the ques- 
tion of proper analytical factors is a difficult one. It has been 
approached from the general angle of weighting the analyses of 
Atwater and Bryant for the different sorts of poultry, broiler chicks, 
fowls, turkeys, etc. in roughly the proportion that the specified 
kind of poultry is marketed, and then taking a weighted average 
analysis to apply to the lump production figure. In determining 
the weighting factors the writer has ventured to allow himself to 
estimate them on the basis of his own fairly long and intimate 
acquaintance with the poultry industry in this country. The 
refuse percentage in preparing poultry for the table is large from 20 
to 40 per cent, in Atwater and Bryant's computation. This ex- 
plains in part why the total contribution to the nutrition of the 
nation by poultry is so comparatively small. 

The weighted mean analysis used in calculating nutrients is 
as follows : 

Protein 13.3 per cent. 

Fat 9 . 3 per cent. 

Calories 639 per Ib. 

47. Eggs. Again annual statistics are lacking, and an estimate 
has to be made on the basis of Census returns. In 1909 the Census 
estimated the number of eggs produced in the year at 1,591,311,371 



SECONDARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 63 

dozen. The Animal Husbandry Division of the Department of 
Agriculture is of the opinion, with which the writer agrees, that 
owing to better methods of husbandry the productivity per fowl 
has been rising somewhat since 1909. They suggest that in recent 
years an annual production of 1,875,000,000 dozen probably repre- 
sents the facts. The production in 1917-18 was unquestionably 
lower than in the previous year, due to high prices for feed on the 
one hand, and for poultry on the other hand. On the basis of the 
above consideration I have estimated annual production figures as 
shown in Table 11. The average weight of eggs was taken at 1.5 
Ib. per dozen. 

X 

DAIRY PRODUCTS 

48. Dairy Products (as Milk). Under this rubric are included 
all the dairy products, milk, butter, cheese, etc. It is possible to 
get a much more accurate result by handling the matter in this way 
than would be the case if one attempted to separate the several it ems. 
All are expressed in terms of milk. 

To obtain the production of milk it is assumed that each cow, 
as enumerated each year under the rubric "Dairy Cows" by the 
Bureau of Crop Estimates of the Department of Agriculture, 
produces on the average 154 Ib. of butter fat in the year. This 
estimate is one which is agreed to by the Dairy Division of the 
Department of Agriculture and is probably very close to the truth. 
Multiplying this average annual production by the number of dairy 
cows gives the total production of butter fat. It is next assumed 
that the milk will average to test 3.6 per cent. fat. This estimate 
may be a little high, but it cannot be far from the fact. This leads 
to an average milk production per cow of 4278 Ib. per year. 

As to the nutritional distribution of the product it is assumed 
that 96 per cent, of the fat content of the milk, and 50 per cent, each 
of the protein and carbohydrate content go to human food uses. 
Of the remainder it is assumed that 3 per cent, of the total fat and 
40 per cent, each of the total protein and carbohydrate contents 
go to animal feed; in the form of skim milk, butter milk, and milk 
sucked by calves. The residue (1 per cent, of the total fat content, 
and 10 per cent, each of protein and carbohydrate contents) is 
assumed to be lost, wasted, and used for non-food industrial purposes. 

The conversion factors, by which commodities in units given are

Since at this point we are concerned only with the presentation 
of basic data, detailed discussion of the results set forth in Table 1 1 
will be deferred to a later chapter. Before passing to the next phase 
of the subject, however, it is of interest to compare the total sec- 
ondary food production in the successive years covered. This is 
done in Table 12 and in Fig. 4.

SECONDARY FOOD PRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES 73 



jit is evident that the production of secondary foods is a more 
stable matter than the production of primary foods. The maximum 
fluctuation in the relative figures of Table 13 amounts to only 
12 or 13 points in any nutrient or the total production. This would, 
on the whole, be expected because of the fact that animal produc-

1911. Solid line denotes total secondary food production; dash line, protein con- 
tent of secondary foods; dot line, fat content of secondary foods; dash-dot line, 
carbohydrate content of secondary foods. 

tion operates from a base which is much more nearly perennial 
than crop production and is also less influenced by small environmen- 
tal changes. The growth and production of a herd of cattle or hogs 
is less affected by unfavorable weather conditions in a particular 
season than is a crop of wheat, for example. 

A second point which strikes one at once in comparing secondary 



74 THE NATION'S FOOD 

with primary food production is that, during the period of time 
here under discussion, the maximum productivity is attained in 
different years in the two cases. The maximum of gross production 
of secondary foods is reached in the last year of the period, 1917-18. 
The same is also true of all the separate nutrients except protein, 
which falls in 1917-18 a little behind the 1916-17 production. 
The maximum primary production was, as we have seen earlier, in 
1915-16. 

The last line of Table 12 shows that of the 368,541,782 metric 
tons of secondary foods produced in the seven years, which amount is 
the residue after all necessary deductions, 3.8 per cent, net was 
protein available for human nutrition, 9.1 per cent, fat and 1.8 
per cent, carbohydrate. Or, put it another way, all the net nutrients 
in secondary foods, after allowing for inedible refuse, amount to 
but 14.7 per cent, of the total net tonnage of such foods. The 
remaining 85.3 per cent, represents (a) water, (6) inedible refuse 
and (c) ash. These figures, in comparison with the similar ones 
for primary foods given in the preceding chapter, show at once 
how different in a physiological sense the secondary foods are from 
the primary. The great outstanding function of the secondary 
foods is to supply fat in a form relished by human beings. Further 
of course these foods play an important role in supplying body 
building protein and vitamines. 



CHAPTER V 
TOTAL HUMAN FOOD PRODUCTION] 

Having now completed the survey of the production of primary 
and secondary food materials separately, it is desirable to combine 
the two and put the material in such form as to make possible 
certain general conclusions regarding the total production of human 
food in this country. At the outstart it needs to be again made 
clear exactly what the figures signify. As explained in the text 
of Chapters III and IV, in detail, the total production in metric 
tons means, in case of each commodity, the net production of that 
commodity available for human food, after deductions for seed, 
spoilage, animal feeding, industrial uses, etc. The nutrient pro- 
duction figures show, for each commodity, the net amount of protein, 
carbohydrate, fat, and calories, which can be got as human nutrients 
out of the total produced, after allowing for the inedible refuse which 
was still included in the total commodity production figures, even 
after the general deductions described above had been made. 

It will be of interest to consider first the results in the mass. 
Table 14, which is a combination of Tables 8 and 12, shows the total 
production of human food in each year covered in this study and 
the percentage contribution of primary and secondary foods to 
this total. 

The total production of human food within the period under 
consideration increased rather steadily to a maximum point in 
1915-16 and then fell off in the last two years. The same course 
was true of protein, carbohydrate and calories. The fat production 
followed a different line, reaching a maximum in 1917-18. 

Comparing the four war years with the three prewar years, it 
is seen that the average annual production had been definitely 
greater in the war period. The absolute and percentage amounts 
of the increase are shown in Table 15.

cross hatched bar. 

The greatest average annual increase is in carbohydrate, then 
follow calories and protein close together. Fat production shows 



78 THE NATION'S FOOD 

the smallest relative increase over prewar conditions. In general 
the war years show about 10 per cent, increase in production of 
human food over the prewar. This result is shown graphically in 
Fig. 5. 

This increase in production of food in the United States during 
the four war years is the result of two circumstances : first, favorable 
crop conditions in the first two years of the war, and second, heavy 
export demand with associated high prices, which led the farmer 
to plant large acreages. That the second of these factors alone will 
not suffice to bring about increased production, unless the first is 
present, is shown by the conditions in 1917-18, when the production 
fell off badly in the face of the highest prices known for many years 
for farm products. 

It is instructive in this connection to compare 1917-18, our 
first year in the war as a combatant, with the three preceding war 
years. Owing to the fact that this country was actively involved 
and that furthermore the need on the part of the Allies for food 
from America was greater than in any prewar year of the war, there 
was every incentive to an increased production. But the fact is 
that production in 1917-18 fell distinctly below the average of the 
three preceding years 1914-15 to 1916-17, inclusive, for all items 
except fat. This is shown in Table 16.

The results in this table are extremely interesting from a nutri- 
tional standpoint. It appears that while the gross total production 
of food in our first year in the war was only insignificantly smaller 
(0.8 per cent.) than the average of the three preceding war years, 
we were short 5 per cent, in protein, and nearly 10 per cent, in 
carbohydrate. In total calories we were 4.5 per cent, short. Only 



TOTAL HUMAN FOOD PRODUCTION 



79 



in fat was the 1917-18 human food production as great as in the 
three preceding years, and there the excess was only 2.4 per cent. 
Following the lean year 1916-17, which depleted all reserves nearly 
to the vanishing point, it is clear that during our first year in the 
war our food problem was a real one. Only by a reduced domestic 
consumption and the most widespread and rigid conservation could 
there be any hope of meeting a normal export program. In later 
chapters the facts regarding consumption and export will be 
presented. 

The next point to which attention may be turned is the propor- 
tionate contribution of primary and secondary foods to the total 
nutritional production. Taking the whole seven year period to- 
gether it is seen that while only 42 per cent, of the total tonnage of 
human food production is primary and 58 per cent, secondary, 
51 per cent, of the protein, 94 per cent, of carbohydrates and 59 
per cent, of the fuel value come from the primary foods, which are 
of course chiefly of plant origin. The secondary or animal foods 
make their large contribution in fat, furnishing 83 per cent, of the 
total. Protein for human food is produced about equally from 
plant and animal sources. If we put fish, here classed as a primary 
food source because no feed is expended in its production, with the 
other animal foods the protein balance in production would be 
thrown definitely to the animal side. 

Altogether Table 14 is an impressive object lesson to those 
tending to belittle the importance of foods of animal origin in the 
national nutrition. Any source which contributes, in fact, about 
half the protein and half the calories, and nearly 85 per cent, of 
the fat produced in the country, cannot safely be treated in a step- 
motherly manner, if the proper nutrition of the nation is to be 
maintained. Furthermore these facts woulol appear to give little 
comfort to the vegetarian cult. The United States is a reasonably 
healthy nation, as populations go. This condition of health is 
maintained on a diet in which animal products contribute very 
substantial amounts, as has been seen. 

The figures of Table 14 also demonstrate in a striking manner 
what a vast quantity of raw materials has to be grown to yield a 
sufficient amount of nutrients. Summing the percentages of the 
last line of Table 14 it is seen that only 29.0 per cent, of the total 
tonnage of human food materials produced is net nutrients. The 
remaining 71.0 per cent, of the total tonnage is made up of water, 



80 THE NATION'S FOOD 

ash, and inedible refuse. What this means may be made clear 
by a comparison. Suppose one found that 71.0 per cent, of his 
winter's coal supply was slate and stones which would not burn, 
and only 29.0 per cent, was real coal which would burn. That situa- 
tion would exactly parallel that of the material used to stoke the 
human furnace. These facts are shown graphically in Fig. 6, 
in such way as to show the net nutrients and wastage in the total 
and in primary and secondary human foods. 




FIG. 6. Diagram based on Table 14 to show graphically the net nutrients in 
human food, of primary and secondary origin. Cross-hatched areas represent pri- 
mary foods, and stippled areas secondary foods. 

The next point to which attention may be turned is that of the 
relation of production to population. Many years ago Malthus 
argued that population always tends to outrun subsistence. It is 
of course clear at once that in a food-exporting country like the 
United States subsistence is still far ahead of population, but it is 
desirable to set forth here the facts as to per capita production 
during the period covered by the study. 

The population of continental United States, as estimated by the 
Bureau of the Census for January 1 of each year (the mid-point of 
the fiscal years used in this study) is shown in Table 17.

It is evident from this table that there is as yet no occasion for 
worry along Malthusian lines in this country, so far as subsistence 
is concerned. Not only do we produce more food than we consume, 
but there is no definite falling off in the ratio between subsistence 



82 



THE NATION'S FOOD 



produced and population. There were more total nutrients per 
capita produced in human foods in 1917-18 than in 1911-12. Fur- 
thermore the annual average production of all nutrients, separately 
and combined, was distinctly higher during the war period than 
before the war. 

We may turn now to one of the most interesting points in the 
whole study, namely the relative nutritional importance of the 
productions of different commodity groups and single commodities. 
In making an analysis of this point it is desirable to get as long a time 
base as possible, in order to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in the 
crops in individual years. 4 Consequently averages for the whole 
period of seven years have been used throughout. Tables 19 and 
22 give the annual average nutritional content of each of the sev- 
eral primary and secondary human food groups. These seven year 
averages are first stated in absolute figures (metric tons) and then 
as percentages of the total. Finally the percentages are cumulated.

FIG. 7. Diagrams showing the relative importance of the different main groups of 
human foods, in the production of nutrients in the United States. 



TOTAL HUMAN FOOD PRODUCTION 85 

The results of these tabulations are of interest and significance 
from the standpoint of national nutrition. Taking first protein 
we see that approximately 85 per cent, of our total production of 
protein f otr human food purposes is contained in the three commodity 
groups, grains, meats and dairy products. Of the remainder 11.5 
per cent, is produced in two groups, viz., poultry and eggs, and 
vegetables. Nearly 42 per cent, of the total protein produced in 
human foods in this country is derived from the grains and 25 per 
cent, from the meats. 

Approximately 92 per cent, of the nutrient fat produced in the 
form of human foods comes from three sorts of commodities; 
namely, meats with 55 per cent, of the total, dairy products with 
25 per cent, of the total, and oils and nuts with 12 per cent, of the 
total. 

Ninety-one per cent, of the carbohydrates are produced in the 
grains,, sugars and vegetables, with the grains preeminent (72 
per cent, of the total). 

In the total production of energy values (calories) in human food 
the grains are again outstanding, with 42 per cent, of the total. 
With meats and dairy products they make up 81 per cent, of the 
total calory production. Oils and nuts and sugars stand on approxi- 
mately an equal basis, with about 5 per cent. each. 

Altogether it is plain that in the production of human foods in 
this country, grains, meats and dairy products are the most impor- 
tant sources, in the order named. Outstandingly the United States 
is a grain producing nation. 

Let us turn next to a consideration of the relative nutritional 
importance of the production of individual commodities used as 
human food. The data are given in Tables 23 to 26 inclusive. 
These tables are drawn up on the same plan as those for the com- 
modity groups just examined. Seven year annual averages were 
made from the earlier basic tables for each commodity. These 
means are then arranged in descending order of importance, first 
in absolute and then in percentage terms.

FIG. 11. Diagram showing the relative importance of the different human food 
commodities in the production of energy values (calories) in the United States. 

Figures 8 to 11 inclusive are diagrams based on Tables 23 to 26. 
The bars show the relative importance of the several commodities 
in respect of production. 



92 THE NATION'S FOOD 

The outstanding position of wheat in the human food production 
of this country is the most striking feature of these tables. It 
stands first in the production of protein, carbohydrate and calories, 
and fifth in the production of fat. No other raw material source 
of human food stands near it in general importance. These tables 
show very clearly why it is that so much stress was laid upon this 
commodity in connection with the food factor in winning the war. 
Even though the claim be allowed that there are plenty of other 
foods just as good as wheat the fact still remains that in bulk signifi- 
cance in the production of human nutriment in this country wheat 
stands in a class by itself. The energy content of the wheat crop 
is nearly double that of its nearest competing commodity. The 
same is true of the protein content, while in carbohydrate content 
the average net wheat crop for human consumption is about 6 
times as great as that of the closest competing commodity. About 
2 per cent, of all the fat for human nourishment produced in this 
country is in the wheat crop. 

Next to wheat in all round nutritional importance from the 
production standpoint in this country comes the hog. This lowly 
creature stands far and away ahead of any other source in the pro- 
duction of fat for human nourishment, with over 42 per cent, of 
the total production of this nutrient to its credit. It stands fourth 
in the production of protein, and second in the production of total 
energy values. 

The third outstanding producer of human nutriment is the dairy 
cow. She stands second in the production of protein and fat, fourth 
in the production of carbohydrate, and third in energy value. If 
we take into account the nutritional significance of the dairy prod- 
ucts in the broadest sense, including a valuation of the growth 
promoting substances of milk, it would probably be correct to place 
the dairy cow ahead of the hog as a contributor to our food resources. 
Leaving further discussion of this point aside, however, until we 
have consumption figures in hand, it is entirely clear that the wheat 
crop, the hog, and the cow together comprise our great reservoir 
of human nutrients. Together they produce 62 per cent, of all 
the protein and carbohydrate used as human food, 69 per cent, of 
all the fat, and 65 per cent, of all the calories. 

The second most striking feature of Tables 23 to 26 consists in 
the fact that only a comparatively few commodities are at all sig- 
nificant individually in the total nutrient production of the coun- 



TOTAL HUMAN FOOD PRODUCTION 93 

try. In the case of protein there are only 12 commodities which 
individually contribute as much as 1 per cent, to the total produc- 
tion, and only 8 that contribute as much as 2 per cent. The total 
fish catch, for example, furnishes less than 2 per cent, of the total 
protein produced in the country. There are only 11 commodities 
individually contributing as much as 1 per cent, of the total fat 
produced for human food. The same is true of carbohydrate pro- 
duction, of which there are 12 commodities each contributing 1 
per cent, or more to the total energy production. 

These facts make it evident that any campaign for increased food 
production, to be really effective in a nutritional sense, must be 
concentrated on a very few of the great staples. Even if one mul- 
tiplied the onion crop, for example, by such a practically impossible 
amount as ten fold it would still contribute something less than 1 
per cent, of the total calory production in the form of human foods. 
The United States Department of Agriculture has showed great 
wisdom during the war in concentrating its production campaign 
chiefly on wheat and hogs. 

Another point in the same connection relates to the home garden 
movement. That it was and is in every respect a highly laudable, 
patriotic, and to some extent economical thing for everyone who 
can do so to grow food in his back yard, goes without saying. But 
the public is prone to over-estimate the nutritional significance of 
this sort of activity. When it is remembered that the total com- 
mercial production on the farms of the country of sweet potatoes, 
beans, peas, onions, cabbage, and of corn, peas, and tomatoes for 
commercial canning, amounts altogether to only 2 per cent, of the 
total calory production in human foods, and further when one re- 
calls that the home garden production of vegetables cannot possibly 
be more than a very small fraction of the commercial production 
of vegetables, it is clear that the home gardens can contribute to the 
total nutritional resources of the country only an extremely in- 
significant bit. 

Again, the poultry industry considers itself, and rightly so, an 
important enterprise in the welfare of the country. But considered 
objectively as a nutritional resource, poultry and eggs together con- 
tribute less than 2 per cent, of the total production of calories in 
human food, only about 6 per cent, of the total protein, and about 3 
per cent, of the fat. 

Of the vegetables the potato is the only one which makes, by 



94 THE NATION'S FOOD 

itself, any particularly significant contribution to our food resources. 
This crop makes up about 3 per cent, of the total protein production, 
nearly 6 per cent, of the total carbohydrate production, and a little 
over 3 per cent, of the calorie production. 

Taking all the data of Tables 23 to 26 together it is clear that 
the statistics on human food production given in this and the pre- 
ceding chapters must be within 2 or 3 per cent, of absolute 
completeness, from the nutritional point of view. For the minor 
crops which are here omitted obviously produce far less net nutrient 
material than those listed in the last half of Tables 23 to 26. But 
the last 24 commodities listed in Table 26 contribute all together 
less than 3 per cent, of the total energy value of the 48 human foods 
listed. And these last 24 items include such crops as fish, veal, peas, 
onions, cabbages, oranges, peaches, etc. It is obvious that the 
omission of such things as strawberries, blueberries, mushrooms, 
cucumbers, celery, home garden vegetables, etc., cannot possibly 
have affected significantly the net result. 

In concluding this chapter I wish to emphasize once more what 
was said at the beginning, lest there may be any misunderstanding 
on the reader's part, namely, that in this chapter we have dealt 
with figures of production only, not consumption, and of human 
foods only, not feeds or fodders. 



CHAPTER VI 
GROSS IMPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 

(Commodity Reference Nos. 49-97) 

Having dealt with the production of human foods in the United 
States we turn, as the next step in the analysis which will finally 
end in consumption statistics, to a consideration of the human 
food materials which come into this country in the way of imports. 
Here the basic statistics are those of the Department of Commerce. 1 
Included in the food imports as here given are the shipments of food 
materials from Porto Rico and Hawaii to the United States. Those 
from Alaska are allowed for in production (fish) and those from 
the Philippine Islands are included in the Department of Commerce 
import figures. 

The present chapter deals with gross imports only, and in 
consequence no deductions are made here for industrial uses and the 
like from the gross imports as given by the Department of Com- 
merce. When later we come to apply net imports and exports 
to the determination of consumption, proper deductions for the 
factors mentioned will be made. 

Unfortunately it has not been possible to include every item of 
foodstuffs imported, for the reason that the import statistics 
of certain minor items are given in values only and not in pounds 
or other unit of quantity. It would be an extremely hazardous 
procedure to attempt to convert values to quantities on these items, 
particularly for earlier years. Hence it has seemed wisest to leave 
such items out of the tables altogether. In any case they are 
insignificant nutritionally. A few other items such as mushrooms 
and truffles, were omitted because of their slight nutritional 
significance. 

In a few cases it has been necessary to estimate the imports for 
the earlier years, because in those years the figures for these par- 
ticular commodities were not separately stated in the reports of the 

1 Monthly Summary of Foreign Commerce of the United States, Depart- 
ment of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. 

95 



96 THE NATION'S FOOD 

Department of Commerce. Instead they were then included in 
some general "all other" class. In making such estimates the 
guide has been the importation in the years when it was definitely 
known. 

The gross imports, under the sanje general classifications as 
were used in Table 7, Chapter III, of primary foodstuffs are 
exhibited in Table 28. Notations regarding the separate com- 
modities are as follows : 

GRAINS AND THEIR DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

49. Macaroni. This item includes besides macaroni, the other 
alimentary paste products, spaghetti, vermicelli and spaghetti 
and the like. The analytical figures used were the averages of the 
analyses of macaroni, vermicelli and spaghetti, as given by Atwater 
and Bryant. 

50. Rice. This item includes the cleaned and rough (uncleaned) 

. whole rice imported from all foreign countries and from our insular 
possessions, especially Hawaii. The uncleaned rice imports have 
been converted to a cleaned basis, before calculating the nutrients, 
so that the one item includes both cleaned and rough as cleaned. 

51. Rice Flour. This item includes rice flour, meal and broken 
rice. This agglomerate was assumed to have the same nutritive 
values as whole cleaned rice. A deduction will be made farther 
on for fodder and non-food uses of this item. 

52. Wheat The nutrients in the flour from all the wheat 
imported were calculated, making allowance for a different rate 
of extraction in 1917-18, as in the case of our domestic production. 
Deductions will be made later. 

53. Wheat Flour. Total nutrients calculated. 

VEGETABLES 

54. Beans and Lentils. The nutritional factors for this item 
were obtained by averaging Atwater and Bryant's factors for 
dried beans, dried lima beans and lentils. 

55. Onions. Nutrients in total imports calculated. Deduc- 
tions for spoilage will be made later. 

56. Peas, Dried. Nutrients in total imports calculated. 

57. Potatoes. This item does not include sweet potatoes, the 
imports of which are too small to be separately listed by the De- 
partment of Commerce. The nutrients in the total imports were 
calculated. Deductions for spoilage will be made later. 



GROSS IMPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 97 

SACCHARINE MATERIALS 

58. Honey. The Department of Commerce has given separate 
import figures on this item only for the fiscal years 1917-18 and 
1916-17. The figures for the earlier years are estimates based on 
the assumption that the imports of this commodity were much 
smaller in the years when it was included in "all other articles. " 

59. Molasses. Here the same nutrient factors as for domestic 
molasses were used, which, it will be recalled, left out the ostensible 
protein content on the ground that this was really nutritionally 
inert nitrogenous matter. Deductions from this item for in- 
dustrial uses will be made later. 

60. Beet Sugar. Nutrients of total imports as refined sugar 
calculated. 

61. Cane Sugar. Cane sugar is imported into the United States 
in the form of raw sugar to the extent of all but a trifling amount. 
Before calculating nutrients the imports have been converted 
to terms of refined sugar (see p. 170 supra for the reason), on the 
assumption that 100 pounds of raw yields 93 pounds of refined. 

62. Maple Sugar and Syrup. The analytic factors used for this 
item were the averages of At water and Bryant's factors for maple 
sugar and maple syrup. Inasmuch as imports of these commodities 
were not separately reported until 1914-15 I have estimated the 
import of the three first years at the average of the four following 
years. 

FRUITS 

63. Bananas. The import statistics are given in units of 
bunches. The average weight of a bunch has been taken here as 
54 pounds and the Department of Commerce figures converted from 
bunches to pounds before calculating nutrients. A deduction of 
10 per cent, is made for the stems before calculating nutrients. A 
further deduction for spoilage will be made later. 

64. Currants. Nutrients in total imports calculated. 

65. Dates. 

66. Figs. 

67. Raisins. In items 65, 66 and 67 the nutrients in the total 
imports have been calculated. 

68. Olives. Inasmuch as there is a great variation in the analy- 
sis of olives as reported by different authorities, and as import 
figures are given in gallons, and furthermore as both ripe and green 



98 

olives are imported and differ considerably in composition, it becomes 
a puzzling matter to decide upon proper nutrient factors for this 
item. After studying the matter it has been decided to take the 
Atwater and Bryant figure for green olives as purchased, as prob- 
ably being as near to a fair average as one can get. A gallon of 
olives is taken to weigh 8.1 pounds. 

69. Oranges. On this item a departure has been made from the 
general rule of not considering imports stated in values only. Be- 
cause of the desirability of getting a consumption figure for this 
fruit it was felt to be desirable to make some estimate of the imports 
in terms of poundage, using the value figures as the basis. This 
has been done with results which, if admittedly rough, are cer- 
tainly nearer the truth than would be a complete omission of this 
import item. 

VEGETABLE OILS AND NUTS 

70. Almonds. 

71. Filberts. 

72. Peanuts. 

73. Walnuts. 

In items 70 to 73 inclusive the nutrients in the total imports 
have been calculated. Inasmuch as a portion of the imports in 
each of these cases is in the form of shelled nut meats, and the balance 
in the form of unshelled nuts, the nutrients have been separately 
calculated for the two moieties, and then the results combined to 
give the values here used. 

74. Cocoanut, Shredded. Only the shredded or manufactured 
portion of the cocoanut imports is taken here, because the edible 
oil from the rest of the cocoanut importation has been taken account 
of under production. The shredded cocoanut is used directly as 
human food. 

75. Cream and Brazil Nuts. Nutrients in the total imports 
were calculated. 

76. Chinese Nut Oil. 

77. Edible Olive Oil. 

In items 76 and 77 the nutrients in the total importation have 
been calculated. No deductions are made here or later, as these 
oils are practically entirely used for food purposes. 

78. Cocoanut Oil. 

79. Cottonseed Oil. 



GROSS IMPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 99 

In items 78 and 79 deductions for industrial uses will be made 
later. Here the nutrients of the total imports are taken. 

80. Cacao, Crude. This and the following item are included 
in the general group of oils and nuts, not because they have a 
completely logical status here, but because in a nutritional way 
they come nearer to this than to any other main group. The out- 
standing nutritional contribution of cacao and its products is fat. 

The analytical figures for crude cacao were taken from Leach. 
In determining the protein factor the theobromine content was first 
subtracted from the total nitrogenous material. The factors here 
given are for the whole bean, nut and shell. 

Here the entire nutrients in the imports are taken. Deductions 
will be made later for extracted cocoa butter industrially used. 

81. Cocoa and Chocolate, Mfd. This item does not include 
confectionery, but does include all other manufactured cocoa and 
chocolate. No deductions are made from this item, either here or 
later. For the analytical factors the average of Atwater and Bry- 
ant's figures for cocoa and for chocolate was used. 

82. Cured Fish. This item includes the following rubrics of 
the Department of Commerce Reports: " Cured cod, haddock, 
hake and pollock," " Cured herring" and " Cured mackerel." 
The analytical factors used are the averages of Atwater and Bry- 
ant's figures for (a) salt cod as purchased, (6) smoked haddock as 
purchased, (c) mackerel, salt, entrails removed, as purchased, (d) 
smoked herring as purchased, the salt cod being weighted twice to 
the others once, to allow for salt herring for which analyses are not 
available, and for the larger amount of cod in the composite figure. 

83. Fresh Fish. For this item the same nutrient factors were 
used as in the case of the item fish (No. 35) in Table 7. Since these 
figures were for edible portions only the same deduction for refuse, 
48.184 per cent., has been made from the gross import figures as in 
the production statistics, before calculating the nutrients. 

84. Crab Meat. Nutrients in total importation calculated. 

85. Lobsters. This item includes both whole or fresh and 
canned lobsters. 

The nutrients were calculated separately for the two sorts and 
the results combined. 

The factors used in calculating nutrients in short tons from the 
commodity units given are exhibited in Table 27. The values got by 
these factors are changed to metric tons by multiplying by 0.9072.

The first noticeable feature of the summarized import data is 
the course of events in successive years. It is plain that throughout 
the seven years covered here there has been a steady increase in 
food imports. This increase has been relatively most marked 
in protein and fat. The precise character of these yearly changes 
is most clearly to be seen from Fig. 12, 

The dominant position of sugar in our food imports is apparent. 
The carbohydrate line ascends steadily alongside the total line, 
but without showing the fluctuations of the latter. The fat and 
protein imports are insignificant as compared with the carbohydrate. 

Comparing the prewar averages with those for the war years 
it is seen that the total gross primary food imports were 17.4 per cent, 
greater in the war period than prewar; the protein imports were 
59.8 per cent, greater; the fat imports were 51.2 per cent, greater; 
the carbohydrate imports were 22.2 per cent, greater; and 
the calory content of the gross primary food imports was 25.3 
per cent, greater in the war period. These are all notable increases. 
They indicate first the negligibly small effect of the German sub- 
marine campaign on our food imports, and second the fact that 
high prices in the United States in the war period greatly stimu- 
lated the imports of primary foodstuffs.

THE NATION'S FOOD 



It is a matter of great interest to see what proportion of our 
total primary food production the gross primary food imports 
form. In order to show this Table 30 has been prepared. 

The data of Table 30 are shown graphically in Fig. 13. 

The percentages of Table 30 are higher than would have been 
expected generally. We are accustomed to think of the United 
States as a food exporting country, which in a broad way it is. 




FIG. 13. Showing the percentages which total primary food imports are of 
total domestic production of primary foods. Solid line, total imports and total 
productions; dash line, protein; dot line, fat; dash-dot line, carbohydrate. . 

But this does not mean that it imports only insignificant quantities 
of food materials. Taking the three year prewar period the gross 
primary food imports were in total 13.9 per cent, of the total 
domestic production of primary foods. Or put in another way, 
of the total normal primary human food resources of the country, 
from which must come domestic consumption and export, about 
one pound was imported for every seven produced here. Sub- 
stantially the same thing was true of fat in primary foods. 



GROSS IMPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 111 

In the case of protein the prewar average gross primary imports 
were just 4 per cent, of our domestic production of protein in 
primary foods. The carbohydrate percentage is 23. This means 
that in the total carbohydrate resources of the country in the form 
of human foods approximately one pound was imported, for every 
four pounds domestically produced. These percentages greatly 
increased in the war period, as the last line of the table shows. 
In 1917-18, chiefly because of the falling off in sugar imports, 
the percentages for gross total, carbohydrate and calories fell off 
slightly. The protein and fat percentages were, however, higher. 

Another matter of considerable interest is the weighted average 
analysis, as given in the last line of Table 29, of imported primary 
foods as compared with domestically produced primary foods. By 
comparing these figures with those given in Table 8 (Chapter III) 
it is seen that the imported foods contain less than half as much 
protein as the domestically produced. They are, however, richer 
in fat and carbohydrate, especially the latter. This of course arises 
from the tremendous relative weight of sugar in our primary food 
imports. If one were to consider the other primary food imports 
alone, leaving out the sugars, it would be found, as would be ex- 
pected a priori, that the imports are much richer in protein and fat 
than the domestic production of the same food. Overseas trade in 
food naturally tends toward concentrated forms of nutriment. 

We will now turn to a consideration of the gross imports of sec- 
ondary human foods. The basic data are shown in Table 32. The 
conversion factors are given in Table 31. The data came from the 
reports of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, of the 
Department of Commerce. The general plan followed has been 
as in the case of primary food imports. No deductions are made at 
this point. Whatever deduction may be necessary will be made in 
connection with the consumption tables in 'a later chapter. "As 
purchased" analyses, which allow for inedible refuse as explained 
earlier (cf. p. 33 supra), are used throughout. 

MEATS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

86. Beef and Veal.- These meats are given as one item in the 
import statistics of the Department of Commerce, and it is there- 
fore impossible to separate them here. It is probable, however, that 
the veal constitutes only a very small fraction of the total under 
this rubric. Accordingly we have felt justified in using factors for 



112 

beef in calculating the nutrients. The same factors were used as 
for the item Beef in Chapter IV. (Reference No. 36.) 

87. Mutton and Lamb. Here again the factors for mutton 
(Reference No. 42) were used in calculating the nutrients, on the 
assumption that the great bulk of the imports fell into that cate- 
gory, and because of the impossibility of separating the imports. 

88. Fresh Pork. Here a different set of factors was used for 
calculating nutrients than in the case of domestic production, for 
the reason that in the production figures lard was included with the 
fresh pork. In the imports this would not be the case. As a 
matter of fact, a study of imported and exported meats indicated 
that the fairest factors to use in calculating nutrients for these 
items would be Atwater and Bryant's figures for medium fat loins. 
Accordingly that plan has been adopted for the imports. 

89. Bacon and Hams. The factors used for calculating nutrients 
were derived by first taking an unweighted average of Atwater and 
Bryant's figures for "Ham, smoked, all analyses" and "Shoulders, 
smoked, all analyses," and then taking an average of these figures 
and "Bacon, smoked, all analyses." This assumes an equal rep- 
resentation of bacon, hams and shoulders in the imports. This may 
or may not be correct, but even if it is not, any weighting to allow 
for difference in the import of the three commodities, would prac- 
tically make very little difference in the final factors. This must 
clearly be so because of the general similarity of the analyses of 
these products. 

90. Bologna Sausage. Analytical figures were taken from At- 
water and Bryant. 

91. Oleo Stearin. This material is taken as 100 per cent. fat. 

POULTRY AND EGGS 

92. Eggs, Whole. The same analytical factors are used as in 
production statistics. (Reference No. 47.) 

93. Eggs, Dried, Frozen, etc. Here we are dealing with a group 
of egg products largely used by manufacturing bakers, etc. It 
being impossible to get any absolutely exact analytical figures for 
such a mixture the Atwater and Bryant factors for the edible portion 
only of fresh eggs have been used. This is as close an approxima- 
tion as it seems possible to make. It would be rather seriously 
inaccurate if dried eggs formed any considerable proportion of the 
total, but we understand that such is not the case. 



GROSS IMPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 113 



DAIRY PRODUCTS 

94. Butter. In the import statistics of the Department of 
Commerce butter substitutes are included with butter. No allow- 
ance can be made for this in the nutrient factors because of lack of 
data. Consequently we have used At water and Bryant's figures for 
butter. 

95. Cheese. This item in the imports includes "cheese and 
substitutes for. " The "substitutes" must, however, be a very 
small fraction of the total. We have used At water and Bryant's 
figures for "cheese, full cream, as purchased" in calculating nutri- 
ent factors. 

96. Cream. Nutrient factors calculated from Atwater and 
Bryant's "Cream as purchased," analysis. 

97. Milk. This import item is given in the reports of the De- 
partment of Commerce only in terms of money value, and includes 
both fresh and condensed milk. The figures set olown in Table 
32 under this item are estimates of the whole fresh milk equivalent 
of this importation. Estimating the matter in this way gets over 
some difficulties in calculating nutrient values and probably leads 
to a more accurate final result than could be reached by attempt- 
ing to deal with the condensed milk fraction of the total import 
separately.

The first thing which strikes one in connection with this table 
is that secondary food imports are of extremely little significance in 
the nutrition of the nation. In terms of gross commodity the 
secondary food .imports in the whole period of seven years here 
covered were only 0.19 per cent, of the domestic production of 
secondary foods. Comparing in the same way the total of Table 
32 with those of Table 12 (Chapter IV) for productions of second- 
ary foods, we find the imported protein in 0.60 per cent, of domestic 
production; while for carbohydrate and calories the percentages 
are respectively 0.22 and 0.39. From these figures it is evident 
enough that the whole secondary food importation into the United 
States might be cut off absolutely, and from a nutritional point of 
view the population would never know that anything had happened. 
The contrast between the primary and the secondary foods in respect 
to their importation is striking. It would make a great difference 



122 THE NATION'S FOOD 

in the nutritional welfare of this country if our primary food imports 
for any reason stopped. 

The secondary food imports are so small and unimportant in re- 
lation to the total that no special significance attaches to the yearly 
fluctuations in the amount of such imports. In general these im- 
ports increased to 1914-15, then fell off greatly in the next two years 
and revived a little last year. 

A noteworthy feature of the secondary food imports is the very 
different weighted average composition which they show in com- 
parison with the domestic production of the same class of food- 
stuffs. Such a comparison is afforded by the last lines of Tables 
33 and 12 (Chapter IV). The protein content of the imported 
secondary foods is about 3 times higher than that of the domestic 
production and the fat and calory contents are each about twice as 
high. The difference seems largely traceable to the fact that all 
the nutrients of milk appear in the imports, while deductions were 
properly made in the domestic production of dairy products, and to 
the different relative contributions of the several commodities to 
the totals in the two cases. 



CHAPTER VII 
GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 

(Commodity Reference Nos. 98-151) 

We come now to the consideration of the last element necessary 
to a calculation of consumption, namely exports. The United 
States is, broadly speaking, a great food exporting nation. This 
phase of the general problem of making a nutritional balance sheet 
has, on this account, especial interest for us. 

The general plan in dealing with exports will be the same as that 
of the earlier chapters, with some differences arising out of the form 
in which the basic statistics are available in the reports of the De- 
partment of Commerce. The export statistics of the United States 
in the strict sense of the word, are reported in two categories, namely; 
first, exports of domestic merchandise, meaning materials which 
either originate in this country or have been so manipulated as to 
enhance their value by processes of manufacture; and, second, 
exports of foreign merchandise, meaning the export of previously 
imported materials. There is still a third class of shipments out 
of the United States, namely those to our non-contiguous posses- 
sions, Hawaii, Porto Rico .and Alaska. These latter shipments 
are not exports in a commercial or economic sense, but so far as 
the present study is concerned they are. In arriving at a balance 
sheet of the food in the United States it makes no difference whether 
wheat flour went to Hawaii or to China. In either case it left the 
continental area of the United States and was not available for 
consumption within that area. The foods shipped to us from 
these non-contiguous areas have been taken account of in imports 
and production. It is clear therefore that the outgo in the same 
directions must be set down on the other side of the ledger. Con- 
sequently three basic " export" tables are required in order to 
arrive at a final net export result: viz. Domestic Exports, Foreign 
Exports, and Shipments to Non-contiguous Possessions. 1 In 

1 It should perhaps be explained that the shipments in both directions be- 
tween the United States and the Philippine Is' ands are included in the regular 
import and export statistics. In other words, these islands are regarded, in 
this sense, as a foreign country. 

123 



124 THE NATION'S FOOD 

order not to encumber the text with too many and too detailed 
tables, it has been decided to present in this chapter only the fol- 
lowing export tables : 

1. Gross domestic exports of primary human foods to foreign 
countries and insular possessions. 

2. Gross domestic exports of secondary human foods to foreign 
countries and insular possessions. 

(1 and 2 comprise exports of human foodstuffs produced in 
the United States.) 

To arrive at these final tables it was necessary to work out in 
addition detailed tables of (a) domestic exports to foreign countries, 
(6) domestic exports to insular possessions, (c) re-exports of imported 
foreign primary human foodstuffs, (d) re-exports of imported foreign 
secondary human foodstuffs. For the reasons above stated it 
seems unnecessary, however, to include all this detail here. 

There is one further point in connection with the method of 
handling the export statistics here which needs careful discussion 
and explanation, because it is the point on which there is likely to 
be most difference of opinion and criticism. It will be noted in 
the export tables in this chapter that of the five great cereals, wheat, 
corn, oats, barley and rye, wheat is the only one included in the 
tables. In case of all the others only the derivative products ap- 
pear and not the whole grain. Thus for corn, only the cornmeal 
export appears. The export of corn, as grain, is accounted for 
among the exports of " Primary feeds and fodders, including raw 
grains." The same is true of oats, rye and barley. 

The first mental reaction of everyone at this point will be to say 
that surely the rye which is exported is used but slightly, if at all, 
as feed for animals. Of course it is not; so far there is no difference 
of opinion. But the first concern -of this whole study is the most 
accurate determination possible of the domestic consumption of 
human food in the United States. We are not, here and now, 
primarily concerned with what happens to our food exports after 
they reach their destination. In determining human food con- 
sumption in this country we start with certain known general 
principles, of which the first is that, broadly speaking, no one of the 
five grains, wheat, corn, oats, barley and rye, is consumed as human 
food in the United States, at least in any appreciable quantity, 
until after it has passed through a manufacturing process such as 
grinding, cracking, rolling, etc. This being so, the amount used 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 125 

in human consumption can be most accurately determined if we 
get statistics of the amount of the derived product, flour, meal, etc., 
actually produced by the mills of the country. This has been done 
in Table 7. The balance of the crop of each of the grains which 
remains after the manufacture of the derivative human food prod- 
ucts is used up in one or another of three ways: either as food for 
animals, or as export, or for industrial, non-food purposes. 

Since for reasons of accuracy, as above stated, the derivative 
products of the grains are alone considered on the production side 
of the human food ledger, it is clear that it would be unfair to 
balance against these the exports of the whole grains. This would 
give an erroneous result in two directions. First, and most im- 
portant, it would make the domestic consumption appear smaller 
than it really is; and second it would imply that all of the raw grain 
exported goes to human food uses, which is only in degree less 
erroneous than to say that all of the export goes to animal feeding. 
The method here used of charging exports of derivative cereal prod- 
ucts only against production, in balancing the human food ledger, 
gives accurate results as to domestic consumption, which is our pri- 
mary problem. At the end of the analysis it also gives accurate 
results as to total amount of nutrients shipped abroad, because all 
of the raw grain imports and exports are accounted for in the tables 
dealing with the class of materials here grouped together under the 
rubric " Primary feeds and fodders, including raw grains." Wheat 
is the only grain differently treated, and in that case the total 
exports, as well as total imports, have been included in the human 
food tables because so very large a fraction of the crop goes to human 
food. It was simpler and just as accurate in such cases to deduct 
proper amounts for uses other than as human food. The corn crop 
presents exactly the opposite situation. Only a small fraction of 
it is consumed directly by human beings. 

With this explanation it is hoped that the reader will be willing, 
for the sake of accuracy in the determination of our domestic 
consumption of food by human beings, to forego any reference 
value which would attach to having data as to exports and imports 
of the whole grains available here. 

In Table 35 are given the total domestic exports of primary foods 
to all destinations, both foreign and U. S. insular, grouped as in 
former tables. Special explanations of the method of arriving at the 
figures are not necessary for many of the items. The nutrient 



126 THE NATION'S FOOD 

conversion factors used are the same as those which have been used 
in the earlier tables and the commodity statistics are taken without 
change from the reports of the Department of Commerce. In 
general no deductions for non-food uses, losses, spoilage, etc., 
are made on export figures, for the simple reason that the whole 
amount as stated leaves our shores, and we are not now concerned 
with what happens to it afterward. There are some commodities 
which have not appeared before, and for these special explanations 
follow. 

GRAINS AND THEIR DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

98. Bread and Biscuit. For the calculation of nutrients of this 
item the weighted averages of all analyses of "crackers 7 ' as given 
by Atwater and Bryant were used. This includes Boston crackers, 
butter crackers, cream crackers, egg crackers, flat bread, graham 
crackers, miscellaneous crackers, oatmeal crackers, oyster crackers, 
pilot bread, pretzels, saltines, soda crackers and water crackers. 

101. Rice. The figures are for cleaned rice. 

103. Wheat. Nutrients in flour which would be produced from 
the stated amount of wheat were calculated, allowing as before for 
higher milling extraction in 1917-18. In other words, the figures 
represent what would have been the nutritive value of the exported 
wheat to the American people had it stayed here. 

VEGETABLES 

105. Beans and Dried Peas. The factors for calculating nutri- 
ents were obtained by averaging Atwater and Bryant's analyses 
of dried beans, dried lima beans and dried peas. 

SACCHARINE MATERIALS 

There is a small export of confectionery from the United States 
which is not reported except in money values. It is nutritionally 
so insignificant an item that it is not worth while to attempt to 
estimate poundage from the values given. 

109. Grape Sugar. The carbohydrate content is taken at 91 
per cent, in calculating nutrient values. 

113. Syrup. This item does not include maple syrup. It is 
made up of the various sorts of mixed cane and corn syrups. In 
calculating nutrients on this item, an average carbohydrate con- 
tent of 85 per cent, has been assumed. 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 127 

114. Refined Sugar. In the export statistics this item includes 
maple sugar. The proportionate amount of the latter in the total, 
however, is so very inconsiderable that no attention has been paid 
to its presence in calculating nutrients. In other words a carbohy- 
drate content of 100 per cent, is used for this item. 

FRUITS 

118. Peaches, Dried. Atwater and Bryant give no analysis 
of dried peaches. As a sufficiently close approximation the analysis 
of dried apricots has been used in calculating the conversion factors 
for dried peaches. These two fruits in the fresh state are very 
nearly alike in composition, and must also be so in the dried state. 

FISH 

127. Fresh Fish. This item is the same as the "Fish, fresh, 
except salmon" export item of the Department of Commerce Re- 
ports. In dealing analytically with this rubric a different pro- 
cedure has been followed than in the case of the production and 
imports. In both those cases it will be recalled that before cal- 
culating nutrients the inedible refuse was deducted. In the case of 
exports the following average of Atwater .and Bryant's fresh fish 
"as purchased" analyses is used to get the conversion factors, 
and these are applied to the total poundage exported. 

Protein 10.0 per cent. 

Fat 2 . 8 per cent. 

Calories 304 per pound 

128. Cured Fish. This includes the total exports of dried, 
smoked, and cured fish which are separately reported by the De- 
partment of Commerce under three heads, viz., (a) "Dried, smoked 
or cured cod, haddock, hake and pollack/' (6) "Dried, smoked 
or cured herring/' and (c) "Fish, dried, smoked or cured, all others." 
The same analytical factors were used as for the corresponding 
import item in Chapter VI. 

129. Pickled Fish. This is the "Fish, pickled, except salmon" 
item of the Commerce Reports. The same analytical factors 
were used as for item 127. 

The conversion factors for such items as have not been given in 
previous chapters are presented in Table 34.

* In the total domestic exports of the year 1917-18 are included the shipments to the Ameri- 
can Expeditionary Forces abroad, as well as shipments to the Commission for Relief in Belgium 
and American Red Cross. 



136 THE NATION'S FOOD 

The next point for consideration is the export of secondary 
foods. No summary or discussion of the gross domestic exports 
of primary foods will be made at this point for the reason that such 
discussion may better be deferred until some further data have been 
presented. The gross domestic exports of secondary human food 
materials appear in Table 37. There are certain items in the table 
which need explanation, but no space will be taken to discuss items 
which have simply received routine treatment, namely export 
statistics taken from Commerce Reports, and conversion factors 
based upon Atwater and Bryant's analyses of the same product, 
or the use of the same conversion factors as in earlier chapters for 
the same products. 

MEATS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS 

132. Canned Beef. The analytic values used to obtain con- 
version factors were those for canned corned beef, as given by 
Atwater and Bryant. The product is fairly representative of all 
the canned beef products in its composition. 

133. Pickled Beef. The analysis used was that of "salted 
mess beef" as given by Atwater and Bryant. 

134. Fresh Pork. The same factors were used as in Chapter 
VI for the imports of the same commodity. 

135. Pickled Pork. To obtain conversion factors an average 
was taken of the analyses of "Dry-salted bellies," "Salt pork, 
clear fat," and "Salt pork, lean ends" as given in Atwater and 
Bryant. 

136. Canned Pork. The analysis of canned boar's head was 
used, as being probably most nearly representative of the run of 
export canned pork. 

138. Hams and Shoulders. Average analyses of hams and 
shoulders were used. 

139-141. Lard, Neutral Lard and Lard Compounds. All these 
products were taken as 100 per cent. fat. 

142. Sausage, Canned. This item includes "canned sausage" 
and "all other sausage" of the domestic export list, and "sausage" 
of the insular list. The average was taken of all analyses of 
canned sausage as given in Atwater and Bryant. Sausage, all 
other. The average was taken of all analyses of fresh sausage as 
given in Atwater and Bryant. 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 137 



143. Mutton. This export item is exclusive of canned mutton. 
The same analysis was used as for mutton and lamb in Chapter IV. 

144-146. Stearin from Animal Fats, Tallow and Oleo Oil. 
These products were taken as 100 per cent. fat. 

151. Milk, Condensed and Evaporated. For the conversion 
factors an average was taken of Atwater and Bryant's figures for 
condensed, sweetened milk and evaporated, unsweetened milk. 

The conversion factors for such products as have not previously 
appeared are given in Table 36.

* The same conversion factors apply to neutral lard, lard compounds and substitutes , 
stearin from animal fat, oleo oil and tallow. 

In Table 37 appear the detailed figures for gross domestic ex- 
ports of secondary human food materials. 

There is only one point regarding the shipments of food to our 
insular possessions which calls for special comment. It is this: 
if one examines carefully into the matter i't will be found that there 
was a/ general tendency for the shipments of human food to Porto 
Rico and Hawaii to increase beginning with the year 1914-15, and 
continuing until 1917-18. Or, in other words, the export of food- 
stuffs to these territories showed the same reaction to war conditions 
as did exports to foreign countries. That this should have been the 
fact seems ridiculous, but it is a fact. It is difficult to conceive that 
the onset of a war in Europe in August, 1914 should have forthwith 
enhanced the need of the inhabitants of Hawaii and Porto Rico 
for imported food. The true explanation of this curious result is

probably to be found in the generally more sprightly selling activity, 
following the war's beginning, by firms doing an export business in 
this country. Generally people nowadays buy not what they need 
or want but what somebody succeeds in selling them. Having one's 
selling hand in, through practice on the foreigner who really had en- 
hanced needs for imported foods as soon as the war was under way, 
it is easily conceivable that our insular brothers have been oversold. 
With Tables 35 and 37 in hand we may proceed to an examina- 
tion of the course of the export movement of human foods produced 
in the United States during recent years. A summary table which 
makes such study possible is given as Table 38.

Table 38 brings out clearly the profound change wrought in 
our export trade in primary human foodstuffs by the war. In 
1914-15, the first year of the war, our gross exports of the commodi- 
ties here under consideration more than doubled in comparison 
with the previous year. Since 1914-15 the gross total exports of 
10 



146 THE NATION'S FOOD 

primary foods from this country have steadily fallen, year by year, 
until in 1917-18 the figure was back nearly to the prewar average, 
and actually smaller than the exports of the same group of commodi- 
ties in 1912-13. A study of Table 35 shows that this decline since 
the first year of the war is almost entirely accounted for in the first 
group of commodities, namely the grains and their derivative prod- 
ucts. To be still more specific it is in the export of wheat and its 
products that the great change has been. In 1914-15 we exported 
8,556,274 metric tons of wheat and wheat products (flour, bread 
and biscuit). Against this the highest previous export was in 
1913-14, with a total gross export of the same products of 3,619.- 
382 metric tons, or less than half as much. It is obvious a priori 
that the export pace for wheat set in 1914-15 could not possibly be 
maintained, since in that year the total was swelled enormously by 
drawing on stored reserves, which high prices brought to light. 
Reserves, invisible supplies and the like can be drawn on to the 
'point of exhaustion just once. Thereafter exports must come each 
year out of the surplus of that year's crop over domestic needs. 
In just such manner did events follow in the case of wheat and its 
products. After the banner export year of 1914-15 the amount sent 
away from our shores was smaller each year, reaching in 1917-18 a 
total (again for the same three products, wheat, wheat flour, bread 
and biscuit) of 3,008,707 metric tons. To be sure almost all of this 
went in 1917-18 to the Allies, which in 1914-15 was very far indeed 
from being the case. We have no occasion, in short, to reproach 
ourselves with having failed to do our just part in feeding the Allies. 
The decline in wheat exports since 1914-15 merely means that in 
each succeeding year since then the total amount of invisible wheat 
in reserve in this country, which the glitter of foreign gold would 
alone bring forth, was getting nearer and nearer the vanishing point. 
Before the end of 1916-17 it was all gone. The wheat exports of 
1917-18 came out of, first a small exportable surplus from the crop 
of the same year, and to a much larger degree from the savings re- 
sulting from conservation, guided and directed by the Food Adminis- 
tration, but actually accomplished by the housewives of America. 

The course of events in the successive years is shown graphically 
in Fig. 14, for the total exports a>nd the individual nutrients. 

The next point of interest to which attention may be turned is the 
relation of gross exports to production. Table 39 gives the facts 
for primary human foods. For each year and each nutrient com-

pound, there is stated in this table the percentage which the total 
gross exports form of the total domestic production.

148 THE NATION'S FOOD 

The results of the table are very striking. It is seen clearly 
how enormously our exports of primary human foods increased at 
the beginning of the war, in relation to production, in respect 
of all nutrients except fat. In the first year the ratio of exports 
to production about doubled for the total protein and carbohydrate. 
In the fat content of primary foods the ratio increased from the 
1913-14 level to about what it was in 1911-12. In all cases the 
ratio fell off in 1915-16, because of the large production of that year, 
only to advance again in 1916-17. The latter year marked what 
is to be regarded as the most serious over-export in relation to pro- 
duction of any year of the war. 

The situation in regard to the exports of fat in the form of 
primary foods, which includes all the vegetable fats used as human 
food, is interesting. In spite of the world shortage in fats the ex- 
ports of this nutrient fell off markedly from the prewar average 
during the war period. As will presently appear, this was com- 
pensated for in the export of animal fats, but there is no apparent 
reason for the decline in the export-production ratio shown in the 
fat column of Table 39. 

In 1917-18, our first year in the war, the export-production 
ratio fell back nearly to the prewar normal. This is unquestion- 
ably a healthy state of affairs at the beginning of a food exporting 
nation's participation in a great waf. It means that we start off 
from atn approximately normal base. If the exigencies of the oc- 
casion should demand it, a nation could later over-export in relation 
to production, just as we did in 1914-15. But at the end of 1917-18 
we were clearly insured against any difficulty as to domestic needs 
because we were holding about a normal proportion of our food pro- 
duction in this country. It must again be emphasized, lest a 
wrong conclusion be drawn, that in 1917-18 practically our total 
food exports went to the Allies, instead of being distributed among 
many countries as in the prewar years. In other words, the decline 
of the export-production ratio in 1917-18 does not at all mean 
that we did not do our just part in feeding the Allies that year. 

Another point which needs attention is the change in the nutrient 
concentration of our primary food- exports in the war years as com- 
pared with prewar conditions. This matter will be more directly 
elucidated in a later table but the general drift of affairs is plain 
enough here. Comparing prewar and war averages it is seen 
that while the ratio of total primary food exports to production was 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 149 

7.4 points higher in the war years than prewar, the protein export- 
production ratio advanced 10.8 points, the carbohydrate ratio 11.5 
points, and the calorie ratio 9.8 points. Plainly more concentrated 
forms of primary foods were exported during the war period than 
in prewar years. This is of course as it should be. The fat con- 
tent as before forms an exception. The export-production ratio 
for this nutrient was 2.3 points lower on the average in the war years 
than in the prewar years. 

The general relations of the export-production ratio for primary 
human foods are shown graphically in Fig. 15 on a percentage basis. 







FIG. 15. Showing the percentage changes during the successive years in the 
ratio between gross exports and production of nutrients in the United States in the 
form of primary human foods. 

It is seen that with the single exception of fat the export-produc- 
tion ratio was above the prewar average in each year of the war, by 
amounts varying from as low as 10 per cent, to as high as 112 per 
cent. This diagram raises an interesting question. How long could 
the country continue exporting food at a higher ratio to pro- 
duction than the normal average? It seems fairly clear from the 
1917-18 figures that we had then about reached the end of such 



150 



THE NATION'S FOOD 



exportation, and must drop back to the normal export-production 
ratio. In the earlier years of the war there were large invisible 
reserves particularly of the grains which could be drawn on to 
increase the ratio. As already pointed out these had disappeared 
by 1917. It is certain that the 1917-18 bars would have been 
below the line instead of above it, had it not been for the Food 
Administration's conservation campaign. 

' We may next turn to a further consideration of the exports of 
secondary foods. Table 37 gives the combined gross exports of 
these foods to foreign countries and to insular possessions. The 
results of Table 37 are summarized by years in Table 40. This 
enables a direct examination of the course of the secondary food 
exports in successive years.

GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 



The course of the secondary food exports in successive years is 
shown graphically in Fig. 16, which is drawn on the same plan as 
Fig. 14. 

It is at once apparent that the secondary food exports have 
followed a totally different course since 1911 to that shown in Fig. 



IL

14 for the primary food exports. The overseas shipments of 
secondary food products were in process of steady decline before the 
war, reaching a minimum in 1913-14, the year immediately preceding 
the outbreak of hostilities. With that event began a marked rise 
in the curve, which has continued throughout the war, reaching 
a maximum (to date) in 1917-18. There is thus exhibited a 
beautiful compensatory behavior between primary and secondary 



152 



THE NATION S FOOD 



food exports. During the war period, as has been seen, the former 
decreased sharply, while the latter increased. The net combined 
result will be shown in a later table. 

It is noteworthy that the export of fat in secondary foods during 
the war years has not kept pace with the total export of such foods. 
There is a distinct and increasing lag each year. In other words, 
our secondary food exports have been progressively less rich in fat 
during the war period. This has been due to the combined operation 
of two factors: first, an actual diminution in shipments of the more 
important pure animal fats such as lard; and, second, an increase 
in the proportion to the total secondary exports of the less fatty 
products, as for example meat and milk. 

The change in the carbohydrate content of the secondary ex- 
ports, which represents almost entirely the sugar in condensed milk, 
is most striking. The exports of condensed milk have increased 
so enormously in the past few years as to result in a total carbohy- 
drate content of the secondary food exports more than 10 times as 
great in the war period as prevailed in prewar years. In 1917-18 
we have the extraordinary result that in the total secondary food 
exports animal products there were something over one-half 
as many tons of carbohydrate as of protein. 

The next point of interest is the relation of secondary food ex- 
ports to the total domestic production of the same commodities. 
The necessary data are given in Table 41.

GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 153 

From this table the following points appear: 

1. There was in general a marked increase in the export-produc- 
tion ratio with the beginning of the war, in the case of secondary 
foods just a&in the case of primary. This was true for all nutrients 
except fat.

2. By comparing Table 41 with Table 39 it is apparent that, 
even at the highest point, the export-production ratio is much 
smaller for secondary foods than for primary. In other words 
we export a much larger proportion of our production of primary 
foods than we do of secondary. The actual comparisons for the 
average of the whole 7 year period are: For total food, 15.4 per cent. 
to 1.7 per cent.; for protein, 22.6 per cent, to 3.3 per cent.; for fat, 
17.7 per cent, to 11.2 per cent.; for carbohydrate, 22.4 per cent. 
to 2.5 per cent.; for calories, 21.9 per cent, to 9.4 per cent. 



154 THE NATION'S FOOD 

3. The fat in secondary food exports shows the least relative 
change in the export-production ratio in the war period as compared 
with the prewar period, and carbohydrate shows the greatest 
relative change. This is clearly shown in Fig. 17, which is drawn 
on the same plan as Fig. 15 for primary foods. 

It is evident from this diagram that the relative increases during 
the war period in the export-production ratio were, on the whole, 
much greater in the secondary than in the primary foods, though 
the ratios themselves were absolutely higher in the latter group. 
The changes in the export-production ratio for protein and carbo- 
hydrate in secondary foods were enormous. 

It will be of interest next to combine the gross exports of primary 
and secondary foods in a grand total, in order that the general 
trend of all human food exports from this country during the war 
may be seen. This is done in Table 42, which combines into a single 
series of totals the data of Tables 38 and 40. 

By comparing this table with Table 14 in Chapter V it is seen 
at once that the contribution of primary and secondary foods in 
the exports is very different from what it is in production. Whereas 
of the total human food produced 58 per cent, is of secondary 
origin, only 13 per cent, of the exported food is secondary. A con- 
siderably larger proportion of the exported fat is of primary origin 
than in the production. Of the total calories exported 77 per cent, 
are of primary origin, while of the total calories produced 59 per 
cent, are primary. In short, primary foods are exported in higher 
proportion to secondary than they are produced. 

| The changes in human food exports as a result of the war are 
shown in total in Table 42. Taking the four war years as compared 
with the three prewar it is seen that the total food, protein and 
carbohydrate exports about doubled in the war period. The fat 
exports increased about one-sixth. The exported calories nearly 
doubled. These facts enable us to form a picture of the significance 
of our food exportation during the war. While our average annual 
food exports nearly doubled during the war period, the average 
annual food production in this country increased in the same period 
less than 10 per cent. But percentages on such different bases 
may be misleading. Figures 18 and 19 show graphically the true 
relation between production and export of human foods.

From these diagrams it is evident that the average annual excess 
of gross human food exports in the war period over prewar was 
not generally greater, and was in some cases distinctly smaller 
than the average annual excess in production in the war period 
as compared with the prewar. To make the comparison precise 
on this point, and also introduce the year 1917-18, Table 43 has 
been prepared.

It is clear from this table that the excess of domestic production 
of human foods during the war period was not entirely exported, save 
in the case of carbohydrate. There has been, of course, a larger 
and a more prosperous domestic population during the war period 
than prewar, and this will account for some of the difference 
probably for all of it and even more in the case of protein. But 
the broad fact is that while it is true that we doubled our exports of 
human food while production increased less than 10 per cent., and 
furthermore notably increased the export-production ratio, there 
nevertheless remained in the country more tons of human food (with 
the exception of carbohydrate) during the war period than did in 
the three years preceding the war. The case in 1917-18 was in some 
respects worse than for the whole war period and in some respects 
better. It was chiefly better in two respects: First, the concentra- 
tion of nutrients of the exported human foods was high in 1917-18 
(compare calories with total food in last two columns of Table 43) ; 
and, second, in that virtually all the exports in 1917-18 went to 
the Allies. The latter is the really outstanding feature of the case. 



158 



THE NATION'S FOOD 



The relative concentration of nutrients in exported human foods 
is much greater than in the total production, as would be expected. 
The calory content of exported foods is rather more than double that 
of all foods domestically produced. 

Figure 20 shows graphically the course of the export movements 
in the successive years. 




FIG. 20. Showing the course of total human food exports since 1911. Solid 
line denotes total human food exports. Dash line, protein content; dot line, fat 
content; dash-dot line, carbohydrate content. 



From this diagram it is evident that the compensatory increase 
in secondary food exports during the war years was not sufficient 
in magnitude to offset the downward tendency of the primary food 
exports. The fat exports form a nearly horizontal line. 

Consideration may next be given the question of the relative 
importance of the different human food commodities and groups of 
commodities in the exports. In approaching this matter it has 
seemed best to use averages for the prewar period (3 years) and the 
war period (4 years) rather than to take an average of the whole 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 159 

seven years, as was done for production. The reason obviously is 
because the volume of the exports was so violently changed by the 
war, while the changes in production are only such as might happen 
at any time one had a succession of two or three good crop years. 
Tables 44 to 47 give the group averages and percentages for the 
different nutrients, as well as the cumulated percentages.

The overwhelming importance of the grains in furnishing pro- 
tein in our human food exports is clear. This commodity group 
furnished 87 per cent, of the protein in the exports before the war, 
and 81 per cent, during the war period. The contribution to pro- 
tein exports by the meats rose in the war period to 12 per cent., 
from the 7 per cent, which it had been before. In the prewar 
period dairy products had stood in the seventh place, contributing 
less than a half of our per cent, of the exported protein (in human 
foods). During the war period the dairy products rose to third 
place, furnishing nearly two and a half per cent, of the total ex- 
ported protein. This is the most notable change in position in the 
table. The fruits and fish, low in nutrient concentration, dropped 
down in relative position in the table during the war years, as would 
have been expected.

In the fat exports of human foods the oils and nuts, without 
changing their relative position, lost in percentage contribution 
to total, and the grains and dairy products gained, the latter notably. 
The meat group also gained, and is, of course, outstanding in its 
contribution to total fat exports. The three groups, meats, oils 
and nuts, and grains, together contribute 95 to 99 per cent, of our 
total fat exports in human foods. 

In carbohydrate exports the grains, of course, come first. Their 
percentage contribution dropped somewhat, however, during the 
war period. The sugar made a notable gain in percentage con- 
tribution during the war, while the fruits fell off as would be expected.

Here in final summary it is seen that the grains and meats 
contribute together about 84 per cent, of the total energy value of 
the human food exports. They contributed this proportion before 
the war, and almost identically the same proportion since, what one 
group lost the other having gained. During the war dairy prod- 
ucts moved up to fifth place, from eighth where it had been before. 

Tables 48 to 51 give the relative nutritional importance of 
individual commodities in the total human food exportation. This 
is of considerable interest in comparison with the similar tables for 
production given in Chapter V and consumption in Chapter IX.

170 THE NATION'S FOOD 

Wheat and wheat flour stand at the head here as would be ex- 
pected, from data already presented. Together they account for 
about 80 per cent, of the protein exported in human foods. There 
are many notable changes in the position of commodities in the war 
years as compared with prewar. Thus fresh beef moved up from 
twentieth to fifth place in relative importance. Fresh pork moved 
up from thirty-fourth place to sixteenth. Rye flour advanced 
from thirty-seventh to nineteenth place. Condensed milk, as has 
been seen already, made a notable advance in its export significance, 
changing from fifteenth place to the eighth. 

Before the war five commodities, wheat, wheat flour, hams and 
shoulders, bacon and rice accounted for more than 90 per cent, of 
the protein exported in human foods. During the war period rice 
has been dropped from this list, and four other commodities have 
come in, namely, fresh beef, beans and dried peas, oatmeal and rolled 
oats, and condensed and evaporated milk. So that, during the war 
period eight commodities contributed 90 per cent, of the total 
exported protein. 

Lard stands at the top of the list in both periods, but it contrib- 
uted 10 per cent, less to the total fat exports in the war period than 
before. One observes in the case of the fat the same thing which 
was apparent in protein exports, namely that in the war period there 
was an increased scattering of exports of nutrients among different 
commodities. Thus in the present case, while in the prewar period 
9 commodities contributed over 90 per cent, of the total fat ex- 
ported in human foods, in the war period 13 commodities were 
required to get over the 90 per cent. mark. In both periods only 
two primary products were included in this 90 per cent, group, 
namely cottonseed oil and wheat (including flour in the war period) . 
The most notable single commodity advance in percentage contribu- 
tion to fat exports during the war is perhaps that of bacon, though 
it involves only a slight change in position in the table. But bacon 
which contributed 8 per cent, of the total exported fat in prewar 
times contributed 22 per cent, during the war period. 

Of the total exported carbohydrate four or five commodities, 
wheat, flour, rice and syrup or refined sugar and glucose account 
for over 90 per cent. In the prewar period syrup was one of the 
five commodities necessary to make up 90 per cent., but was re- 
placed during the war period by refined sugar. Also glucose came 
in the list before the war. Condensed milk moved up from nine-

teenth to ninth place, because of the tremendously increased ex- 
ports and its high sugar content. 

Table 51 well shows the readjustment and changes in human 
food exports brought about by the war. In both prewar and war 
periods 12 commodities contributed over 90 per cent, of the total 
caloric value of the exports. But only 8 out of the 12 commodities

on the prewar 90 per cent, list appear in the war period 90 per cent, 
list. And only 7 out of the 12 commodities on the war 90 per cent, 
list appear in \ the prewar. Refined sugar advanced during the 
war period to third place in caloric contribution to the exports, 
whereas formerly it had been in the fourteenth place in the 
commodity list. Cornmeal and oatmeal, as well as, of course, 
condensed milk, became more important factors in the nutrient 
exports during the war. Fresh beef came forward from forty-first 



GROSS EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FOODS 173 

position to fourteenth. But even then fresh beef contributed 
less than 1 per cent, to the total caloric value of the exported 
human foods. In general, foods of relatively high nutrient con- 
centration moved up in the list during the war and those of rela- 
tively low nutrient concentration went down. This is, of course, 
an expected consequence of the shortage of tonnage.

contribution to the caloric content of exported human foods. 

As a whole these tables bear out the point made when the similar 
production tables were under discussion, namely that the contri- 
bution of a relatively few food commodities to the total is so 
tremendous that a whole flock of really minor, though usually 
considered important, staple foods might be totally neglected 
without making any special difference in the net nutritional result. 
This fact is so evident that in the days of Paley it might well have 
been adduced as a special instance of the goodness of God to food 
administrators as a class. 

The data of Tables 48 to 51 are shown graphically in Figs. 21 
to 24. 



174 THE NATION'S FOOD 

It is evident from these diagrams that, in our exports of human 
food, wheat, wheat flour, lard, bacon, cottonseed oil, hams and 
shoulders, and refined sugar are the only items of special significance 
in a nutritional sense. All but a relatively small percentage of the 
total nutritional value of the human food exports is comprised 
in these commodities. 

Before leaving the subject of exports, and concluding this 
chapter, it is necessary to recall to mind that the data regarding 
what are technically called " foreign exports," which are the re- 
exports of imported foods of foreign origin have not been presented. 
The amounts involved are not generally large, but in arriving 
at a final net export balance accurately it is essential to include 
these re-exports of imported articles. It does not seem necessary, 
however, to present the detailed figures here. In arriving at net 
exports and imports, given in the next chapter, the " foreign export" 
figures were used in attaining the final result. 



CHAPTER VIII 

NET IMPORTS AND NET EXPORTS OF PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY HUMAN FOODS 

It is now possible, by combining the data discussed in Chapters 
VI and VII to arrive at net figures on imports and exports. The 
first step in this process is to make net foreign import tables, which 
can be done by combining Tables 28 and 32 in Chapter VI, which 
exhibit the gross importation of primary and secondary human 
foods, with the tables prepared in connection with, but omitted 
from Chapter VII, which exhibit the re-exportation of these same 
imported foods. The balance, shown in Tables 53 and 55, gives 
the amount of imported foods remaining in this country for con- 
sumption therein. 

In Chapter VI it was pointed out that in making the nutrient 
calculations on imports no deductions for loss, spoilage, etc., were 
there made, it being the intention to make such allowances on the 
final net import tables.. This is done in Tables 53 and 55. In 
arriving at the amounts to be deducted it has been necessary simply 
to make the best percentage estimate possible, there being no exact 
statistics on the matter. Some of these estimates are certainly 
rough, but it must be remembered that because of the slight im- 
portance of imports in the total nutritional intake of this country, 
with the exception of sugar and rice, an estimate of a deduction 
for industrial use or spoilage may be very far out of the way without 
having any significance in the final consumption result. The United 
States is, in this regard, in a very different position from a nation 
dependent upon imports for the major portion of its food. Anyone 
who is critically interested may calculate for himself the effect 
of doubling or halving the percentage deductions of imports listed in 
Table 52 upon the final per capita consumption figures of Chapter 
IX. He will find that only an insignificant and inappreciable 
effect is produced.

NET IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF HUMAN FOODS 



177 



In Table 52 are listed the items on which deductions have been 
made, showing the amount in each case. These amounts are 
stated in percentages and are to be understood as percentages of the 
net imports deducted. For example, suppose in a particular year 
x bushels of wheat were imported and y bushels were re-exported. 
Then (x y) is the net import. According to Table 52 the deduction 
on wheat is 5 per cent. Then the final figure which appears in 
Table 53 for net wheat imports is (x y) 0.05 (x y). The 
same rule is applied in all the other cases. In the case of items not 
mentioned in Table 52, no deductions have been made. 

The same percentage deductions are applied to each of the 
seven years, except in the case of cottonseed and cocoanut oils. 
Undoubtedly the true losses and industrial uses vary somewhat from 
year to year, but it is assumed that these variations are likely to be 
as often in excess as in defect of the percentages here used. In the 
case of the oils more definite figures can be arrived at, and hence 
are used. 

The net primary food imports consumed in the country are shown 
in Table 53.

From this table it is evident that in general the amount of im- 
ported primary foods consumed in the United States has increased 
steadily since 1911-12. The energy content has gone up every year 
except the last. There are some fluctuations in the protein and fat 
curves but the general upward trend is unmistakable in all. In all 
cases the annual average for the war period is higher than in the 
prewar years. 

The secondary food imports consumed in this country are ex- 
hibited in Table 55.

The same regular course of net imports consumed here is not 
observed in the case of secondary foods as was with the primary 
(cf. Table 54). The high points for net secondary food imports 
were in 1913-14 and 1914-15. The anmlal average net import 
rate was lower in the war period than prewar for protein, fat and 
calories. Further, the nutrient concentration of the net secondary 
food imports fell off greatly, on the average, in the war period. This 
is in marked contrast to the net primary food imports, where the 
concentration of nutrients on the average increased in the war 
period. 

Tables 54 and 56 are combined in Table 57, which shows the net 
imports by years of all human foods.

The data of Table 57 are shown graphically in Fig. 25. It is 
clear that the general tendency has been toward the consumption 
of more and more imported foods in this country during the period 
under investigation, but the course of events has not been entiiely 
regular. This is shown in Fig. 25. 

The preponderant effect of sugar in the net imports of food is 
clear. The carbohydrate line is the dominant one. About 70 
per cent, of the weight of all the food brought into the United States 
for consumption is carbohydrate. Protein and fat form a very 
small part of the imported food. 

The way is now cleared for the final net export and import table, 



NET IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF HUMAN FOODS 



195 



which is the last step necessary for the calculation of consumption. 
Table 58 gives the net balance sheet of the external movement of 
foodstuffs to and from this country. The figures in this table are 
the result of taking for each commodity the difference between the 
total gross exports, and the imports for consumption, and calling 
the balance minus when more goes out of the country than comes in, 
and plus when the case is the other way about. In other words, 



FIG. 25. Showing the course of net foreign imports of human foods (consumed 
in the United States) since 1911. Solid line denotes total net food imports; dash 
line, protein content; dot line, fat content; dash-dot line, carbohydrate content. 

Table 58 gives the balances resulting from algebraically adding the 
total gross exports ( ) of Tables 40 and 43 and the residual imports 
for consumption (+) of Tables 53 and 55. If the residual imports 
are larger than the gross exports the balance will be plus, and will 
be marked + in Table 58. If, on the other hand, the gross exports 
are larger than the residual imports the item will be marked minus. 
To get consumption it is necessary then only to add or subtract, 
according to the sign of the item, the figures of Table 58 to the cor- 
responding production figures.

NET IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF HUMAN FOODS 



203 



Table 58 includes both primary and secondary foods. Certain 
special items, such as flour, bread and biscuit, macaroni, etc., which 
have up to this point been handled separately in the import and 
export statistics, are here combined, in the interest of simplicity, 
and referred to the basic raw material, in this case wheat. This 
combination simplifies the table and at the same time leads up to a 
more accurate determination of consumption than would be possible 
if the attempt were made to handle the special items separately. 

This table furnishes a great deal of information not hitherto 
available in readily comprehensible form. We commonly think 
of this country as a food exporting nation, but the matter when 
analyzed is not to be covered by any such simple offhand statement. 
There are very complex interrelationships of human food materials 
in their export and import movements. 

In order to gain a comprehensive idea of the matter it will be 
well to start with a yearly summary of Table 58. This is given in 
Table 59.

NET IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF HUMAN FOODS 205 

Taking all human foods together in this way, it appears that 
in 1911-12 we imported a greater total tonnage of food commodities 
than we exported. Each year since the export tonnage has been 
greater than the import, but in 1913-14 the departure from the line 
of balance was only very slight. In the first year of the war, 
1914-15, the net export of human foods was over 5,000,000 metric 
tons a stupendous amount. After that year the net export fell 
off rapidly year by year until in 1917-18 the net export line was 
nearly back to the zero balance line, and almost in the position 
that it was in the prewar period. 

During the whole period this nation has had a net export balance 
of protein and fat in human foods. And, as Fig. 27 shows, the 
war has not greatly changed the horizontal course of the lines, for 
these two nutrients. The case is very different with carbohydrate. 
The United States had a net import of carbohydrate before the war. 
Its enormous import of sugar was sufficient more than to offset 
all the carbohydrate in exported foods. With the outbreak of the 
war, however, and the enormous exports of breadstuffs and in- 
creased exports of sugar the carbohydrate balance swung very far 
down on the export side in 1914-15. Since then it has been swing- 
ing back again, until in 1917-18 the United States was once more in 
the prewar condition of having a net import of carbohydrate. 

The story of the separate commodity groups is an interesting 
one. In the case of the grains used as human food and their de- 
rivative products we have had a net export balance throughout the 
period investigated. The only point of note is its amount, which 
increased enormously in the early years of the war. 

The vegetables in general showed a net import balance in the 
prewar years. The scale turned the other way to a small export 
balance during the first two years of the war, and then in 1916-17 
swung back the other way to a net import balance which increased 
(so far as nutrients are concerned) in 1917-18. 

The sugars are always a net import balance commodity group. 
The amount runs nearly level, speaking in a broad way, year after 
year. 

Fruits show a net import balance every year. The net import 
of bananas far overtops the net exports of most of the other fruit 
items. 

Oils and nuts form a heterogeneous group. Nuts exhibit, of 
course, a net import balance throughout. Vegetable oils show 



206 



THE NATION S FOOD 



a diminishing net export balance to 1917-18 when it turns to an 
import balance. It must be remembered always that we are now 
speaking only of commodities used as human food. The course 
of the vegetable oils is so interesting that it seems worth while 
to show it graphically, as is done in Fig. 28.

FIG. 28. Net exports and imports of vegetable oils used as human food since 

1911-12. 



Chocolate and cocoa, of course, exhibit always an import 
balance. 

Fish show a small net import balance throughout. 

Turning to the secondary foods a more consistent condition of 
net exportation is encountered. In the meat products the balance 
is always in this export direction, increasing steadily in amount 
during the war period. The same is true of poultry and eggs and 
oleomargarine. 

The dairy products have exhibited an extreme change in their im- 
port-export movement in the period here covered. Before the war 
we showed a small but growing import balance of these products. 
With the onset of the war the balance went the other way and we 
have a steadily increasing net export. The facts are shown graphic-

What this diagram means is that before the war we added to

of dairy products. Since the war we have subtracted from our

human food resources in this country by sending out ever increasing 
amounts of milk and its products. 

It is of interest to compare the totals of Table 59 with those 
of Table 14 (Chapter V) which gives the total production of human 
food in the United States. Taking the whole seven years in- 
vestigated as a unit it is seen that the net amount of human food 
(as commodity) subtracted as net exports from our national food 
resources was, in round figures, 12.5 million metric tons. In 



208 THE NATION'S FOOD 

the same period we produced 630.4 million metric tons of human 
food. In other words, our net loss or outgo of human foods as 
exports was rather less than 2 per cent, of our total production of the 
same foods. 

Owing to the relatively high nutrient concentration of exported 
foods, a slightly different result is obtained with the various nutri- 
ents. Taking protein first it is seen that the total production of 
protein in human foods was, in the whole seven years, 28.6 million 
metric tons. The net subtraction of this fundamental nutrient, 
in the form of human food, amounted in the same period to 3.0 
million metric tons. The net loss by export thus was about 10.5 
per cent, of the production. 

In the case of fat the net exports over the whole seven year period 
are almost exactly 10 per cent, of the production. The carbo- 
hydrate situation is that if the period from July, 1911 to July, 1918 
is taken as a unit, there was no loss by export, but the people of 
the country had all the carbohydrate they produced, which was in 
round figures 115 million metric tons in the form of human foods, 
plus 28,943 metric tons imported. It is, of course, the fact that 
this is a sugar-importing nation which brings about this quite un- 
expected result. 

Taking energy content as indicative of general food value it is 
seen that the net loss in seven years from this country by exports 
of human food was 49.6 million million calories, while the production 
in the same period was 963.6 million millions. The net loss thus 
amounted to about 5 per cent, of the production. 



CHAPTER IX 

THE CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED 

STATES 

We come now to the first goal to which the long and tedious 
calculations in the preceding chapters have been leading, namely 
the consumption of human foodstuffs in the United States. Hither- 
to there have been available only the roughest guesses as to the 
total domestic consumption of all but a few items of food, such as 
wheat and sugar. If anyone were confronted, as the Food Adminis- 
tration was almost daily from the time it started, with the naive and 
simple question, "How much corn, or oats, or molasses, or fish, or 
milk, or nuts' r or any one of a long series of other foods "is con- 
sumed annually in the United States as human food?" no accurate 
answer could be given. Yet the question is obviously a fair one, 
and one which somebody in the nation ought to be able to answer 
with a considerable degree of accuracy. For some 20 odd great 
staple commodities or groups of like commodities it is now possible 
to present figures of a relatively high degree of accuracy as to con- 
sumption. On the basis of these figures it is possible to discuss 
effectively many interesting and important problems; such as, for 
example, that of the relative significance of great groups of staples, 
like the grains and the vegetables, in the nutrition of the people of 
the nation. We can calculate with accuracy the total national food 
bill, and so forth. 

The statistical material in this book has been so developed to 

this point that in order to get the consumption figures it is only 

necessary to add or subtract, according to the sign, the figures of 

Table 58 in the last chapter from those of Tables 7 and 11 of Chap- 

14 209 



' 
210 THE NATION'S FOOD 

ters III and IV. These two tables, 7 and 11, it will be recalled, give 
the net production of human foods. Of course it is necessary to 
group and combine certain items of Tables 7 and 11 to conform to 
the rubrics of Table 58, but this is easily done. 

The final net results as to consumption of human foods are set 
forth in Table 61. In that table the results are given for the sev- 
eral nutrient values, protein, fat, carbohydrate and calories, only. 
This is the most scientific, and as soon as one becomes accustomed 
to it, by far the most useful way of thinking about food consumption. 

There are certain points regarding the makeup of Table 61 
which need to be mentioned here. It will be recalled that in an 
earlier chapter it was stated (p. 32) that no account was taken of 
"carry-over' 7 or crop-end reserves. This policy has been followed 
throughout, and for the reasons earlier stated is undoubtedly the 
most accurate method possible to follow. For practically all human 
foods either one or both of the following conditions obtain regarding 
carry-overs: Either there is absolutely no definite information in 
existence regarding the amount of such carry-over, or it is certain 
that the amount is negligibly small in comparison with the total 
consumption. The one outstanding exception is wheat and its 
products. There the annual reserve on July 1 is accurately known 
and the amount is often large enough to be significant. Conse- 
quently it has seemed advisable in the final consumption table to 
make allowance for the carry-over of this crop each year. The 
theory of the thing is clear. As shown in Table 60 the total re- 
serves of wheat and flour in the country on July 1, 1911, were the 
equivalent of 97,995,000 bushels of wheat. On July 1, 1912, the 
reserves were 84,189,000 bushels of wheat. The reserves being 
smaller at the end of 1911-12 than at the beginning means that the 
difference was consumed in this country. Or, for the year 1911-12, 
there should be added to the consumption figures arrived at Jby 
subtracting net exports from production, 97,995,000 84,189,000 = 
13,806,000 bushels. The same method has been followed for each 
year, except of course that when the reserves are larger at the end 
of the year than at the beginning the difference is subtracted from 
rather than added to the gross consumption. 

The crop-end reserves of wheat and flour are shown in Table 
60 for each year since 1900.

One further point regarding wheat is to be noted. Since Chap- 
ter III was written a revision of the estimate of the 1917-18 wheat 
crop has been made. The final official estimate by the Food Admin- 
istration 1 of that year's crop is 608,287,000 bushels, instead of 
the 620,000,000 bushels used in Chapter III. We have accordingly 
made this reduction in wheat figures for 1917-18 in Table 61.

THE NATION S FOOD 



The first thing which impresses one about the consumption fig- 
ures is their extreme uniformity from year to year, as compared with 
production, exports, imports, with which we have hitherto dealt. 
This is exactly what would be expected, of course. No matter how 
much production, exports and imports may fluctuate, within rather 
wide limits, the people of this country eat about the same amount

each year. To have the statistical calculation come out to this 
result so beautifully is strong evidence of the correctness of the long 
and tedious preliminary calculations which have been presented 
in the earlier chapters. There has been a rather steady small in- 
crease in total gross food consumption, but as Fig. 31 so plainly 
shows, this has been very closely proportional to the increase in 
the population. 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 221 

In the seven year period here discussed the greatest relative 
advance in consumption was in respect of fat, and the least relative 
advance in respect of protein. Ca/rbohydrate content and calories 
increased in the seven years in amount consumed to a degree in- 
termediate between fat and protein. The protein relative line falls 
below the population relative line each year after 1913-14. This

means that since 1913-14 somewhat less prptein has been consumed 
in gross in proportion to the population. The relative line for fat 
was below the population line till 1914-15, and thereafter followed 
it closely. 

The relative figures from which Fig. 31 is plotted are given in 
Table 63. 

With such gratifying assurance of the smoothness of the con- 
sumption results we may proceed to an analytical discussion of the 
numerous highly interesting problems which center about human 
food consumption, and for which data have hitherto been lacking.

The first of such problems to which attention may be turned is : 
To what relative degree do primary, as distinguished from sec- 
ondary, human foods contribute to the total nutritional intake of 
our population? From Table 62 it is seen that 47 per cent, of the 
protein consumed comes from primary sources and 53 per cent, from 
secondary sources. Thus, broadly speaking, the American people 
get over one-half of their protein from animal sources, exclusive of 
fish, which are included in the primary foods. This fact indicates 
at once the importance of maintaining the nation's animal herds 
intact and keeping the price of animal products at not too high a 
level, unless we are prepared to face the alternative of a radical 
and fundamental alteration in the established dietary habits of the 
people. 

In general there has been but little change in this protein- 
source dietary habit in the seven years included in this study. 
What change there has been is in the direction of a smaller propor- 
tion of protein from secondary sources and a larger from primary, 
but the movement has been but slight. As would be expected, a 
much larger proportion of the total fat consumed in human food 
comes from secondary sources than is the case with protein. The 
figures are 82 per cent, from secondary sources and 18 per cent, from 
primary. Again there has been little change in the seven years. 
In spite of all propaganda from dietary crafnks and from commercial 
interests it is clear that the American people depend to an over- 
whelming degree upon animal sources for their fat intake, rather 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 223 

than upon vegetable oils, nuts and the like. This condition is 
naturally reversed as regards carbohydrate. Ninety-four per 
cent, of this nutrient comes from primary sources and only 5 from 
secondary. In the total nutritional calory intake 61 per cent, comes 
from primary foods and 39 per cent, from secondary.

It is interesting to compare the percentage of American nutri- 
tional intake derived from primary and secondary sources with 
corresponding British figures. Calculating roughly from Table I 
of the official British report 1 on the subject I find that 42 per cent, 
of the protein intake, 92 per cent, of the fat intake, and 35 per cent, 
of the energy value of the total nourishment of the population of

the United Kingdom comes from secondary sources. In other words, 
the British get less of their protein and calories and more of their 
fat from animal products exclusive of fish than the Americans do. 
The differences, however, are not great, indicating generally similar 
dietary habits in the two populations, a fact which is known on 
general grounds to be true.

FIG. 33. Diagram showing the relative proportions of the American and the British 
food intake derived from animal sources (exclusive of fish). 



The above comparisons regarding primary and secondary sources 
of human food are shown graphically in Figs. 32 and 33. 

The next problem concerns the relative proportion of the total 
nutritional intake furnished by the several different large food 
commodity classes. The data on this point for the main groups are 
collected in Tables 64 to 67 inclusive. The arrangement of these 
tables is to give first the annual average for the six years preceding 
the entrance of the United States into the war, and then to give 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 225 

1917-18, our first year in the war, separately. The reason for such 
a time division is obvious. There is no reason to suppose that the 
consumption of food in this country was affected by the War till the 
time we entered and the United States Food Administration began 
its work. Before then the population had gone on consuming food 
at about the usual normal rate. There was no reason or incentive 
to do otherwise, except in so far as price had an influence. But in 
1917-18 a wholly new and extraordinary influence was brought into 
play to alter the national food habits. This was the Food Adminis- 
tration, which through its recommendations, on the one hand, and 
regulations on the other hand, sought to modify the consumption 
rate of certain commodities and succeeded in doing so, as will 
presently appear in detail. 

In Tables 64 to 67 the percentage figures are first given sepa- 
rately and then accumulated to 100 in another column. 

The data of Tables 64 to 67 are shown graphically in Fig. 34. 

From these tables and diagrams it is seen that the grains stand 
at the head of the list in contribution of protein, carbohydrate 
and calories. Meats come first in contribution of fat, second in 
protein and calories. Thirty-six per cent, of our protein intake 
normally is in the form of grain, 26 per cent, in meats and 20 per 
cent, in dairy products. These three great commodity groups 
together make up nearly 83 per cent, of the total protein intake. 

The total consumption of human food was absolutely higher in 
1917-18 than the average of the preceding six years. This is to be 
expected from the increase of the population, and means nothing 
till converted to relative terms. But the proportion of the total 
contributed by the grains and meats is smaller in 1917-18. In other 
words, the two great commodity groups on which the most stress 
was laid in the conservation campaign of the Food Administration 
show an absolute reduction in the part which they play in nutri- 
tion. The effect of the conservation work will, however, be more 
clearly shown when we come to the consideration of individual 
commodities. 

Of the fat normally consumed 51 per cent, is furnished by the 
meats as a group; 27 per cent, by the dairy products; and 12 per 
cent, by the vegetable oils and nuts. The grains normally furnish 
3.98 per cent, of the fat intake and in 1917-18 this rose slightly to 
4.16, due to the increased consumption of cornmeal.

modity groups to the nutritional intake of the United States, for (a) six years 
before our entry into the war and (6) 1917-1918. 

The energy values of the groups are especially interesting as 
furnishing a general index of food values. Of the total energy fur- 
nished by the human food consumed 35 per cent, comes from the 
grains, 22 per cent, from the me'ats, 15 per cent, from the dairy 
products and 13 per cent, from the sugars. These four groups 
make up about 85 per cent, of the total energy value of all the 
food consumed. Vegetables contribute only about 5 per cent, fruit 
and poultry about 2 per cent, each, and vegetable oils and nuts 
nearly 5 per cent.

On the basis of Table 67 it is of interest to examine somewhat 
more carefully the changes in consumption rate in 1917-18 as 
compared with the average of the six preceding years. Such 
a comparison is made in Table 68 and shown graphically in Fig. 35.

232 THE NATION'S FOOD 

From Table 68 and the diagram it is observed that the total 
increase in human food consumption in 1917-18 was less (nearly 
Yi per cent.) proportionately than the increase in population, 
both being compared with the average of the six preceding years. 
The consumption of meats practically did not increase at all, 
and the consumption of grains only about 1 per cent. 

The great increases were first in the consumption of vegetables 
and oils and nuts, amounting to 30 per cent, in the one case and 
29 per cent, in the other, and second in oleomargarine where the 
consumption increased nearly 116 per cent, in 1917-18 over the 
average of the preceding six years. In the case of vegetables 
and oils and nuts the increased consumption in 1917-18 is probably 
to be attributed largely to the activity of the Food Administration 
in urging the consumption of these commodities to afford a relief 
of the pressure on wheat and meat products. In the case of oleo- 
margarine the increased consumption is clearly due entirely to a 
favorable price differential as compared with butter and lard, 
taking into a'ccount palatability. 

The only two great commodity groups showing decreases in con- 
sumption in 1917-18 are fruits and fish. In both cases the result 
is probably to be explained by price influences, taken together 
with palatability and popular ideas as to relative necessity in the 
diet. For example the price of meat may rise relatively much 
more than that of fruits or fish without leading to any reduction 
in consumption, owing to the general belief that meat is a more 
necessary article of diet than the other two sorts of food 
mentioned. 

We may next consider the gross consumption of individual 
commodities on the same plan that has just been used in handling 
the groups. The data are given in Tables 69 to 72, inclusive. In 
these tables it will be noted that the cumulated percentage columns 
run to more than 100 per cent, by trifling amounts. This is to take

export table but not in production. In the main consumption 
table it is carried into the sub-total "Meats" but does not appear as 
a separate item, because of the impossibility of calculating it as 
such.

CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 237 

Taking first the protein consumption, as given in Table 69, it 
is seen that wheat stands at the head of the list as a source of protein 
for the population of this country, contributing nearly 29 per cent, 
normally to the total. Dairy products are second with 20 per cent, 
of the total. Beef with 14 per cent, and pork with 11 per cent.

stand next. The other commodities contributing more than 2 
per cent, to the total protein intake of the population are, in the 
order named: Poultry and eggs, corn, potatoes and fish. Taken 
together, these 8 commodities furnish 92 per cent, of the total 
protein intake. We see here again, just as in the case of the pro- 
duction tables, that a very few commodities furnish a very large

percentage of the nutritional intake. This fact, in and of itself, 
helps enormously toward the possibility of making an investiga- 
tion such as this substantially accurate in its results. It is clear 
that the minor items omitted from the calculations have no signifi- 
cance in the final general result. If four food commodities furnish 
nearly 75 per cent, of the total protein ingested it is obvious that a 
large error, or even the entire omission, of single ones of the other 
minor items can have but little effect.

hatched bars denote the consumption in 1917 and 1918. 



Comparing the order of the commodities in 1917-18 with the 
average of the six preceding years, it is seen that the only change of 
position among the eight commodities normally furnishing over 90 
per cent, of the protein is in respect of the last one on the list, namely, 
fish. In 1917-18, the legumes (beans and peas) moved up to the 
eighth place and fish moved to the ninth place. 

Turning to the fat consumption, it is seen that approximately 
40 per cent, of the total fat in the nutritional intake of this country 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 239 

comes from pork and its products. The hog is in a class by itself 
as a source of fat for human nutrition, with the population of this 
country. Dairy products stand second in the list, with approxi- 
mately 27% per cent, of the total. After the dairy products there 
is a considerable drop in percentage contribution in passing to 
the next item on the list, namely the vegetable oils, which normally 
furnish only about 10 per cent, of the fat intake. Beef contributes

almost exactly the same percentage. The four commodities named 
together furnish nearly 87 per cent, of the total fat intake. Only 
one other commodity group namely, poultry and eggs furnishes 
more than 2 per cent, normally. 

In 191718 there are some changes of significance in the relative 
position of the commodities as fat contributors. The first four items, 
pork, dairy products, oils and beef, stand in the same order in 1917- 
18 as in the six years preceding. Nuts moved up in 1917-18 to the

into the war. The cross hatched bars denote the consumption in 1917 and 1918. 

the great commodity groups before our entry into the war, and 
13 in 1917-18, contribute less than 1 per cent, to the total fat 
intake. 

In carbohydrate consumption wheat stands at the head of the 
list with over 42 per cent, normally. The sugars stand second with 
about 26 per cent., and corn with 11 comes next. These three 
commodities, together with potatoes and the dairy products, con- 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 241 

tribute altogether 90 per cent, of the carbohydrate intake. There 
is no change in the relative position of the commodities falling in 
the 90 per cent, group in 1917-18 as compared with the average of 
the six preceding years. 

A noteworthy feature of this Table 71, dealing with carbohy- 
drates is the relative position of the sugars. Many persons regard 
sugar as a pleasant but not essential part of the dietary. It is 
obvious enough that this is a mistaken point of view. Any com- 
modity which furnishes nearly 26 per cent, of the carbohydrate in- 
take of the population may be regarded as an important essential. 
To get an idea of the importance of the sugar relatively it is only 
necessary to compare it with some of the items farther down in the 
table. For example, we see that the sugars contribute more than 
20 times as much to the carbohydrate intake of the nation as does 
rice. 

In Table 72 we get a summarized view of the general nutritional 
importance of the several food commodities, because here we are 
dealing with the energy content as measured in calories. The order 
of the products in this table may be taken as the general order of 
nutritional significance of the great staple foods in this country. 
Wheat stands at the head of the list, contributing nearly 26 per 
cent, to the total. Pork comes next with normally 16 per cent., 
and dairy products third with 15 per cent., and the sugars fourth 
with 7 per cent. Then follow corn, beef, the vegetable oils, po- 
tatoes, poultry and eggs. These 9 commodity groups together 
make up over 91 per cent, of the total nutritional intake of the 
population. The smallest contribution to the total nutrition is 
made by oranges furnishing about Ko of 1 P er cent, of the total. 
Bananas and fish furnish only about V\ Q of 1 per cent, of the total, 
and rye and rice only a little more. 

The changes in 1917-18 as compared with the average in the six 
preceding years, as shown in Table 72, are extremely interesting. 
The figures show in much more detail than any that have been 
available hitherto the precise effects of the conservation and sub- 
stitution campaign of the United States Food Administration during 
1917-18. While wheat normally contributes 25.9 per cent, of the 
total nutritional intake (as measured by energy value) , in 1917-18 
it contributed but 21.9 per cent. Or, put in another way this result 
means that as a result of the conservation campaign, wheat fell off 
% in its contribution to the natural nutrition. To go farther down

the total nutritional intake contributed 1 per cent, in 1917-18. 
Rice, in other words, gained by % what it was before in its impor- 
tance in feeding the American people. 

The changes in consumption, as indicated in Table 72, are of 
such great interest that it is worth while to examine them more in 
detail. To this end a table on the same plan as Table 68 is shown.

this diagram the total length of the bars from the line shows the 
total percentage increase or decrease in consumption in 1917-18

therefore the part of the increased consumption to be expected as a 
result of population increase. Where the black bar is below the

top of the cross-hatched population bar it means a conservation. 
Thus the true conservation on wheat amounted to 10.80 + 5.73 = 
16.53 per cent, of the normal average consumption. 

The table and diagram bring out very clearly the effectiveness'of 
the Food Administration's campaign for conservation and substi- 
tution in foods. It will be noted at once that the commodities 
showing great increases in consumption in 1917-18 over the pre- 
ceding years are, for the most part, those which the Food Adminis- 



244 THE NATION'S FOOD 

tration urged to be substituted for articles of which the supply was 
less abundant, and for which the needs of the Allies were greater. 
Thus, rye which constituted the most popular of the substitutes for 
wheat in the public mind, shows the greatest increased consumption 
in 1917-18. Next to it stands the " Other cereals " of our classi- 
fication, including barley and buckwheat. Nuts, rice and the vege- 
tables generally show increases beyond the population increase, 
showing that the people very generally followed the suggestions of 
the Food Administration to consume more of these products and 
save wheat. The articles on which the Food Administration most 
strongly urged conservation namely, wheat, beef, mutton, pork 
and the sugars all show either a consumption actually below the 
normal average, or else a very slight increase in consumption, well 
below the population percentage increase. In either case a real 
and substantial conservation is, of course, shown. The decrease 
in consumption of the most popular fruits, oranges, apples and 
bananas, is largely if not entirely explained by high prices for those 
products. 

The most interesting stage of any discussion of food namely, 
the per capita per diem consumption, may be considered next. Cal- 
culating the results on this basis puts them in a form where one 
may form a better judgment of their meaning and compare them 
with accepted dietary standards. In this connection it is to be re- 
membered that hitherto there have been no careful studies on a 
per capita basis of the actual nutritional intake of the population 
as a whole. All dietary standards are based not on the actual 
practice of the whole population, but rather upon dietary studies 
made on restricted groups of selected individuals. While a very 
large number of such studies have been made by the United States 
Department of Agriculture, particularly from ten to twenty years 
ago, it must be obvious that since such studies are made on selected 
small groups they can only inferentially give any picture of what is 
taking place in the population as a whole. The theory of random 
sampling makes it clear that any considerable inference from dietary 
studies, as they have been carried on, to the whole population rests 
on an exceedingly dubious foundation. It will therefore be of great 
interest to compare the results of the present careful investigation of 
the population as a whole with the results of previous dietary studies. 

In reducing consumption data to a per capita basis it would 
obviously be foolish to take the actual total population as a base, 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 245 

for the reason that the amount of food consumed changes with 
the age of the individual, particularly in early life. On account 
of this fact the usual practice in computations of this kind is 
reduced, not to a per capita basis, but to an adult man basis. 
In doing this a fractional factor is used to multiply the number 
of individuals of certain lower ages, the magnitude of the factor 
being proportional to the relation which the nutritional intake of 
the individual at the younger age bears to that of an average 
adult man. 

In the present study the following age-intake factors have been 
used: 

Age in years Man value factor 

0-5 0.50 

6-13 0.77 

14-18, male 1 .00 

14-18, female 0.83 

19 on, male 1 .00 

19 on, female 0.83 

The man factor values here used have been adopted after careful 
study of the subject. They differ in detail somewhat from those 
adopted by English physiologists in similar calculations, but in 
the net end result come to much the same thing. 

Applying these factors to the total population of the United 
States, and assuming that the age distribution of the population is 
the same in each of the years studied we get the population in terms 
of adult men as set forth in Table 74, for the midyear point of each 
of the years included in this study. The population equivalents in 
Table 74 are used for the base for the per capita per diem calcu- 
lations which follow.

Before entering on the detailed discussion of per capita consump- 
tion figures it is well to recall a point which is liable to escape atten- 
tion, unless special attention is called to it. This is the fact that the 
final figures in this chapter, which are called " consumption figures," 
really include something more than consumption in a nutritional 
sense. They include the food actually eaten plus that which is 
wasted by loss in cooking, in garbage, etc. It is necessary to be 
entirely clear on this point. In calculating the nutrients in earlier 
chapters, use has been made of factors which allowed for inedible 
refuse, so that all of the inedible portions of the foods as produced or 
imported have already been deducted in the calculations up to this 
point. Even after all deductions of inedible portions have been 
made, however, it is obvious that there is still a considerable amount 
of loss and wastage of strictly edible material, which might be saved 
and consumed under a theoretically ideal system of preparing food 
for the table plus a conscientious ingestion of every bit of edible 
material. Of course, as a matter of fact, neither of these theoret- 
ically ideal conditions at all prevail. There is a considerable loss 
of nutrient values in the process of cooking as ordinarily practised. 
This loss is undoubtedly greater for fats than for any other of the 
nutrients. It is a troublesome and time-consuming process for the 
housewife to conserve and utilize all of the fat which gets melted and 
floats about in the water in which foods are cooked, or adheres to 
the utensils in which they are prepared. Nor, in the minds of most 
people, is there any necessity or desirability of saving this fat. 
In fact, a great many people in this country object very strongly to 
what they designate as " greasy cooking/' Consequently, floating 
fat of soup stock is skimmed off and thrown away in the vast majority 
of instances. The result is that in calculations made in the way 
those of this study have been made, which include the total nutrient 
value in the edible portion of food materials, after deducting inedible 
waste and deducting the losses which accrue up to the time the 
food reaches the consumer, there is bound to be an apparently 
high consumption of fats. The figures here presented are really 
statements of consumption plus edible waste and should be so- 
regarded. 

Another important factor is that of edible waste in garbage: 
That is to say, the uneaten portion of the prepared food which is 
edible and might be consumed, but is not for reasons of taste, over- 
estimation of ingestive capacity, etc. 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 247 

It is quite impossible to arrive at any accurate estimate of what 
the amount of losses of nutrients in cooking and in avoidable wast- 
age of edible material is. On the first point it would be extremely 
difficult ever to gather accurate data because the practice of house- 
wives and cooks varies so enormously in this regard. That a great 
deal can be accomplished in reducing the amount of edible material 
going into the garbage can has been demonstrated with both the 
civilian and the Army population of the United Spates during the 
past year. 1 

The recent study of Murlin (loc. cit.) gives the data regarding 
edible waste obtained from the nutritional surveys of the training 
camps. The average figures for 213 messes show that 7 per cent, 
of the protein supplied was wasted, 9 per cent, of the fat and 6 per 
cent, of the carbohydrate. Because of special conditions sur- 
rounding the investigation, however, and because of the differences 
of camp life, these figures are not at all applicable to civilian 
conditions. 

Looking at the matter from the national point of view, it seems 
probable that of the protein in human foods left in the country for 
consumption in the statistical sense, it is safe to say that 5 per

cent, is lost in edible wastage; of the fat left in the country for 
consumption as human food, it is believed that at least 25 per cent, 
is lost through wastage. This figure seems large, but it probably 
underestimates rather than overestimates the fact. Of the carbo- 
hydrates, probably there is 20 per cent, of edible wastage. 

The total statistical consumption (ingestion plus edible wastage) 
of human food in the United States, by years from 1911 to 1918 is 
shown on an " adult man" per capita basis in Table 75. 

Applying the estimated percentage deductions for edible wastage 
stated above to the per capita average for the whole period we 
have the following results for ingested human food : 



114 grams protein 

127 grams fat 

433 grams carbohydrate. 
3424 calories . . 



per man per day 

per man per day 

per man per day 

per man per day 



These figures are probably very close to the fact as regards 
protein and carbohydrate. They are probably somewhat too high 
still as regards fat, because the edible wastage of this component 
is higher than the 25 per cent. used. The intention, however, has 
been to use the most conservative figures in estimating waste. 

For purposes of comparison Table 76 is inserted. This table 
is based upon certain American dietary studies analyzed in the 
writer's statistical laboratory.

CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 249 

The general agreement of these results with those set forth in 
the present study, which were reached by totally different procedure, 
is evident. The statistical estimate of per capita protein consump- 
tion over the whole population is distinctly higher than in this small 
group. The fat consumption is higher but not by so large an 
amount as protein. The farmers and professional men show

a higher net energy intake than the general average for the 
whole country, which would, of course, be expected. Mechanics 
are a little lower than the average for the country in energy intake. 
In any case there is one fact which must not be lost sight of, 
namely that while the figures of Table 75 do in fact represent 
ingestion and waste it still is true, and the constancy of the figures 
in successive years proves its truth, that to maintain naturally 
and unconsciously a contented feeling the population in respect of 



250 



THE NATION S FOOD 



nutrition, actually uses up the amounts of nutrients indicated in 
Table 75. To make these gross consumption figures materially less 
would require a profound readjustment of the dietary and culinary 
habits of the people, fixed by centuries of usage. Discussion of the 
minimum protein, fat and carbohydrate requirements of a nation are 
in considerable degree academic if they base themselves upon net

of human food, per adult man per day. 



consumption rather than gross consumption. A considerable 
excess over any agreed upon minimum physiological requirements 
must always be allowed, because there will inevitably be, in fact, 
a margin between actual gross consumption and net physiological 
ingestion or utilization. The present study, through the figures 
summarized in Table 75, gives a clearer and probably more nearly 
exact picture of what this margin between net and gross con- 
sumption must be, in a population of the habits of the American 



CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 251 

people, than has hitherto been available. It may well be theoret- 
ically true that a man needs only 75 grams or 50 grams of protein 
per day to sustain life and health, but in actual fact the American man 
uses up, in one way or another, about 120 grams a day. Furthermore, 
if the last seven years experience is any criterion, he will continue 
to use up about 120 grams per diem until such time as his general 
habits of life are in some manner rather profoundly changed. 
Doubtless they can be changed. But until they are, one must count 
on supplying about 120 grams of protein per day to each man equi- 
valent component of the population. 

The data of Table 75 are shown graphically in Figs. 41 and 42. 

From these diagrams it is apparent that there has been only a 
very slight decrease in per capita gross food consumption since 1911. 
This probably does not mean that the population is eating any less, 
but that because of the gradually rising prices through all this period 
there has been a minutely slight narrowing of the margin between 
gross and net consumption, or, put in another way, there has been 
some reduction in the wastage of edible foods. 

In Table 77 are shown the gross consumption figures, on a per 
capita per day adult man basis, for all commodities.

CONSUMPTION OF HUMAN FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES 259 

In bringing this book to a conclusion, the writer would empha- 
size that he has been solely concerned in the presentation of an 
accurate picture of the facts regarding an obviously important mat- 
ter, national nutrition. He has no theories to propound about these 
facts, and discussions about the relations of national nutrition to var- 
ious social, political, medical, economic, or industrial problems are 
conspicuously absent from the book. This is deliberate. It does 
not indicate that the writer fails to perceive these problems, and 
their relation to national nutrition. It means rather that he has 
thought it wiser to separate sharply the facts as such from their 
possible application. The book constitutes a definite piece of 
statistical research, precisely delimited as to scope. It makes avail- 
able for the first time a knowledge, to at least the first degree of 
approximation, of how much and what kinds of food the American 
people as a great whole eat. 



APPENDIX 

THE CONSUMPTION OF NUTRIENTS BY DOMESTIC ANIMALS IN 
THE FORM OF FEEDS AND FODDERS 

It was the original intention in this study to follow the statistical 
analysis of human food consumption with an equally detailed and 
searching analysis of the consumption of nutrients by the domestic 
animals. Indeed, the preliminary statistical work had been com- 
pleted. But the signing of the armistice and the consequently 
necessary diversion of the writer's energies and interests into 
totally different channels have made the carrying out of the original 
plan impossible. It does, however, appear desirable that all of 
the work done on the animal feeds and fodders should not be lost. 
Consequently, I am inserting here as an appendix the final table 
of consumption of animal feeds in the several years. The figures 
in this table were reached by precisely the same statistical plan 
as has been followed in the case of human foods in the body of the 
book. Exports and imports were balanced to get net exports. 
These net exports were deducted from net production (after taking 
out losses, etc.) to find net consumption. In the final table here 
reproduced many single products, which in the intermediate 
calculations were kept separate, are grouped in large general classes, 
such as "Wheat and products." This rubric includes all the wheat 
milling by-products, wheat fed as such, etc. 

Beyond the figures given in this table should come the nutrients 
derived by grazing animals from green pasturage harvested by the 
animals themselves. In certain of the European countries attempts 
have been made to estimate this exceedingly difficult quantity. 
Under the conditions of animal husbandry prevailing in the United 
States, and having due regard to the enormous size of the country 
and the consequent diversity of conditions, it seems to the writer 
hopelessly impossible to arrive at a significant national estimate 
of the amount of nutriment got by animals from pasturage. One 
can, of course, guess at a figure, but there is no means' of evaluating 
the probable error of the guess. Consequently, the figures given 
in the following table are to be interpreted as minimum amounts 
of nutrients consumed by domestic animals, which can be definitely 
accounted for statistically. To them should be added the unknown 
X of pasturage.
