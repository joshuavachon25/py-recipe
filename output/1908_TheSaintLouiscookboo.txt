PREFACE. 



The Woniairs Cliarity Board and the fliitiior Cliarity Board 
of the Missouri Baptist Sanitarium, as their names imply, are or- 
ganized for the great purpose of increasing the charity fund. 

The expenses are*heavv and the funds limited. The cry of 
the helpless sick is continually in our ears and the needs of this de- 
partment are very urgent. Last year the two boards were able to 
support 170 beds in the charity ward, but it has been accom- 
plished only with tireless exertion, and the cry for more help is 
calling to us — "For ye have the poor with you always, and when- 
soever ye will ye may do them good." It is for this great pur{)ose 
this Cook Book has been compiled. The most earnest eifort lias 
been made to give the pul)lic a reliable work, composed of rec- 
ipes gathered from the best home-keepers. It is ottered at 
$1.00 a volume and we send it forth with the cordial recjuest that 
you will number it among your cook books, and thereby not only 
add a work of intrinsic value but by so doing you will contribute 
to sutl'ering poor of The ^lissouri Baptist Sanitarium. 

There is an old adage to the etfect that nature itself tells us 
w hat to eat in the various vegetables and fruits of each season, as 
well as in the varieties of flesh and fish meats. 

When housewives complain that they grow tired of the "same 
thing, day in and day out, for the table, and do not know what to 
offer for a change,"' they might go to wise Mothei- Nature for 
hints. 

In winter it is true in the particular degree of climak? we 
must consider, there is not the variety in fresh vegetables, of 
course, that is to be had in more Southern latitudes. But it will 
be then in the serving the housewife can show her ability to pro- 
vide those changes for her table so necessary to the health of her 
family. 

In fJanuary she will find jjonltry and fish; the latter where 
water courses run swift through the fertile Missouri lowlands. 

Pigeons, chickens, turkeys in plenty, and this is the month of 
the year for fresh pork in all its best forms: sausage, head chease 
spare ribs, the sucking pig: these are all good during this month. 



Spinach, salsify, lettuce, cabbage, white and sAveet potatoes, 
and in sheltered places hardy turnips, carrots and parsnips. 

As for fruits apples may be had all winter; pears of late fall 
ripening, well wrapped ; grapes in abundance ; oranges and ba- 
nanas brought from the South, but in season. And in the dried 
fruits count prunes, dates, figs, all of which properly cooked 
oU'er suitable variety for the first month of the year. 

For February the list must of course read about the same; 
where care can be given to growing vegetables under glass cu- 
cumbers and tomatoes may be oifered once in a while, but the 
flavor is never so good as when grown out of doors. 

In March we may have fresh rhubarb, that fruity vegetable 
which is in itself a remedy for all the "Spring Fevers" so many 
are subject to. Its fragrant acid acts directly upon the system 
that has been loaded, as it were, with caloric-nuiking foods the 
past months. In March, too, the housewife should not grudge 
the sums spent for early berries, water cresses, and all the green 
things she can find, if they are quite fresh; these are indeed na- 
ture's physics for the human body.

FOOD IN SEASON. 



In April if the season be natural come berries; the very first 
are therefore costly. Spring carrots are to be had, too; that 
homely vegetable so little appreciated nsually. And so whole- 
some are they ; so full of the iron and salts needed in the blood. 
Young chickens are on hand now; tender pullets and fat capons; 
young geese and ducklings, just right for the table. Such heavy 
meat as pork should be given up now; year old mutton, or lamb 
that is not over six months old gives fine roasts with mint sauce 
for the spring dinners. 

May gives the housewife plenty to choose from in most lo- 
calities; she has lamb chops, squabs, pigeons, spring chickens, 
young turkeys, a great delicacy, these, and many j)laces tiny new 
potatoes, to say nothing of the spring onions, dandelions, mus- 
tard greens, chives and lettuce that are sure to come up alongside 
of the almost ripe tonuitoes, cucumbers, etc. As much fruit and 
as many vegetables as ])ossible on the family table, with poultry 
substituted for meats, and fresh fish when possible, should be the 
rule this month. - ^ 

June gives everything good to eat: all the berries; cucum- 
bers, tomatoes, new potatoes, egg plant, cauliflower, spinach, 
cress, lettuce, there is no end to the list, and by judicious selection 
the table may have something different every day of the week. 

Beans, both the lima and the butterbean are fine all through 
the summer ; many times green corn may be had early this month ; 
also where care has been taken with the early cantaloupes. But 
it is not worth the while of the thrifty housewife to pay exorbit- 
antly for these ; they are not needed with the delicious black and 
dewberries that are so cheap. If these are served fresh, with 
very little sugar, without cream, only rinsed and chilled they are 
all the better. It seems to be the pride of the average housewife 
to "put up" all the fresh fruit she can get hold of in i)lace of al- 
lowing her family to eat it fresh and raw, the way the Lord in- 
tended it to be eaten, at the right time and season. 

July and August call for no list : Dame Nature takes care 
of her children generously during these months; she fills h;^;- 
trees with glowing fruit; she sweetens the melons as they li;-; sli'.> 
puts the bloom u|)on the peach and the apricot and gives it - de- 



iicious flavor to the nectariiio. In addition she ripens every vege- 
table the human can desire; corn is sweet; okra ripens; tomatoes 
hang like crimson apples in the sun : fish, flesh and fowl are all 
good to eat now ; the only thing left to do is to prepare and serve 
them right. 

All summer vegetables are good during September and mel- 
ons are usually finer; September peaches, pears and grapes are 
ripening too, and as for meats, lamb, good beef, fowl of all sorts, 
with the addition of wild game in many places, are all to be had. 
To specify would only be to repeat ; the markets and the gardens 
where the housewife is fortunate enough to have her garden to 
go to, answer in lavish profusion. 

In October the housewife finds fresh vegetables again in the 
markets sown during the smnmer months and it is well to provide 
them instead of beginning with canned goods. 

String beans and corn, radishes, turnips, blood beets and 
fresh young carrots add to the list, and graj^es are ripening finer 
each day in their different varieties. Late plums and the cling 
stone peaches are good in the fruit line also, and cantaloupes are 
still to be had. O.ysters may safely be used this month, but care 
should be taken as to their freshness. Fowl and game should 
supply the meats of the table; the long months are at hand when 
heavy meats will have to be served. 

For the next two months, November and December, the 
housewife has to serve very much as in January; markets are sup- 
plied from the far South during these months and vegetables are 
not fresh. Sweet potatoes should be offered now ; they are good 
and may be served in a variety of w^ays, each palatable and savory. 
Fresh pork in December may safely be used, but it should be 
cooked long and well.

POULTRY 



To select }>onltrv, choose those that are fresh and fat. To 
determine whether they are youno-, try the skin inider the wing or 
leg, if easily broken, it is young, or turn the wing backwards, and 
if it yields easily, it is tender. 

Choose a yellow-skinned fowl, and a hen bird is preferable, 
as having the finer flavor, and being more profitable on account 
of their shorter, broader shape, thus giving more meat in propor- 
tion to the Aveight. The hen turkey is especially fine for boiling. 

.Chickens should be scalded. Other fowls and game should 
be picked dry until the featht'rs are removed. Singe to remove 
the down and hair. 

Turkeys should l)e bought with white meat and black legs. 
As they advance in years their legs become red. Chicken turkeys 
are one of the most esteemed luxuries in the market, and whether 
thej' are best roasted and stuffed with chestmits and sausages, so 
that the crisp skin is fairly bursting with savoriness, or boiled 
with a celery sauce, so that each mouthful fairly melts in the 
mouth, epicures find it hard to decide. 

HOW TO HAVE A COOP OF FAT HEALTHY FOWLS. 

Build a coop so that a rat can not get into it ar any time. 
This may be done by setting it some distance from the ground 
on post but this can be left to the builder as there are various ways 
to exclude these pests. Build so that it may be well ventilated 
and screen the south side with wire if possible. Now buy of your 
dealer one dozen or more chickens, broilers and young hens or 
whatever kind you desire. In the winter and fall it is well to buy 
about three nice turkeys find that they all get along nicely to- 
gether. Place news papers the more the better on the floor, put a 
heavy vessel half full of water (use a heavy vessel so that the 
fowls can not turn it over easily), every morning in summer time 
or Ayarm weather twice a day. Now have a little trough made of 
boards about three feet long, place it in the coop for their food, 
take the crumbs and grind stale bread, potatoes or any left oyer 
vegetable, but be sure that it is cut up fine, moistened, but not 
sloppy, Ayheat or chopped corn cooked should be used also daily. 
The vessels should be removed every evening and remain outside 
the coop over night to air and be kept clean. Allow no slop or 



THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. 41 

moisture or sour food in the coop, tlie papers that you ])hice daily 
will pack together without odor, and can be easily removed with 
n long- handle shovel every few days. I have ke])t fowls for years 
in this manner and have never had a sick or unhealthy one.

ing CA^ery 15 minutes. Noav put into the oven and bake Avith the 
coA'er on until thoroughly done turning over once and basting as

ROAST TURKEY. 

Carefully pluck the bird, siiige it with Avliite paper, and wipe 
thoroughly with a cloth, draw it, preserve the liver and gizzard, 
and be particular not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will 
remove the bitter taste it imparts where it once touches. Wash 
it inside wclK and wipe it thoroughly with a dry cloth, the out- 
side merely re(iuires wiping nicely. Cut olf the neck close to the 
back, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over, break the 
leg-bones close beloAV the Icnee, draw out the strings from the 
thighs, and flatten the breast-bone to make it look plump. After 
this is all done, prepare a dressing of chopped sausage and bread- 
crumbs, mixing in butter, pepper, salt and thj^me to flavor. Fill 
the craw and the body of the turkey Avith this, and sew up care- 
fully. Dredge with flour and put in the oven to roast, basting 
freely, first with butter and water, tJien with the gravy from the 
pan. The time it takes to roast will depend both on the age and 
the weight of the turkey. If you have a good fire, you will be 
safe to allow 10 minutes or so to the pound. Roast to fine brown 
and serve with the chopped giblets, which should be well stewed, 
add cranberry sauce. J//'.s'. A. Rirlx'ftU. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Select a young gobbler, or hen, and to heighten this rich 
flavor have it dry picked. If the turkey has been carefully 
drawui, wipe out the inside thoroughly with a damp cloth, wash- 
ing with much w-ater extracts the delicate juices. If not very 
tender, par boil for an hour before roasting or stuffing. After the 
turkey has been filled, not too tightly, with the kind of dressing 
decided upon, sew up wdth twine, draw the legs firmly against the 
body, fold the wings under the back and tie all firmly together 
v»ith cotton cord. Grease the bird well with butter, place it in a 
hot oven to sear quickly to prevent the juices escaping during the 
roasting. When seared add a pint of boiling water and baste fi"e- 
quentl^^ Twenty minutes to the pound is the usual length of 
time allowed for roasting. 

Giblet Drcssiug.^ — Take the gizzard, heart and liver of a 
turkey, boil till tender, and three-quarter pound salt pork, chop 
altogether, then take stale bread crumbs, add to thi> chopped meat, 
then add pepper and salt and sage, or prepared seasoning, and 
wet it up with the Avater in which the giblets were boiled. This 
makes a delicious dressing. If an onion flavor is liked, chop up 
1 onion and add. Mrs. I. H. Cadwallader.

KOASTED TUKKEY WITH OYSTER DRESSING. 

1 quart of fresh oysters, 1 pint of bread crumbs, 3 eggs and a 
small piece of butter. This is enough dressing for a 12 lb. tur- 
key. jNIix Avell together and stuff the turkey, bake 214 hours. 
Always have oven hot before putting in the turkey, it is well to 
have a covered baking pan, as it improves your turkey very much. 
This recipe is excellent when done properly. 

Miss Rose Fournie. 



, ROAST GOOSE. 

Parboil until tender, use turkey dressing, or seasoned mashed 
potato. Roast with a pint of water in the pan and baste often, 
when done pour off the surplus fat as it is too rich for the gravy, 
and add water to make up the amount required. 

]\[rs. I. H. Cadivallader. 

TO ROAST A TURKEY. 

After turkey has been stuffed tie down legs over tail bone to 
prevent breaking through. Place in roaster, 2 mason jar tops, 1 
at each of 2 corners diagonally, on which rest the perforated rack. 
(This is done to keep the turkey out of the water.) Put 1 qt. of 
water in the pan and then put in the turkey. After the turkey 
is in the pan brush over the breast Avith melted butter, put on top 
securely. A ten pound turkey requires 3 hours in a moderate 
oven. Regular turkey roasters are self-basters, but if any other 
kind of pan is used the turkey should be basted every 20 minutes. 

Mrs. B. A. Wilkes. 

TURKEY WITH OYSTER DRESSING. 

An oyster dressing is considered by all lovers of the bivalve 
a great addition to this king of birds. Add to % loaf of stale 
bread % cupful melted butter, season with salt and pepper, add 1 
quart of oysters finely chopped, use the liquor and water enough 
to make the right consistency. Fill the turkey with his mixture. 

Chestnut Dressing. — Shell 1 quart of chestnuts, put them in 
hot water and boil until skins are softened, then drain off the 
water and remove the skins. Replace the blanched chestnuts in 
water and boil until soft, chop fine, add i/^ loaf stale bread, i/o cup- 
ful melted butter, season with pepper and salt, and add enough 
hot water to soften bread crumbs. 

Mi's. I. H. Cadwallader. 



THE ST. LOUIS COOIv BOOK. 47 

TO STEAM FOWL. 

Prepare the fowl as for baked chicken, place in the dish, well 
season, add 1 cup of rice partly cooked and steam until done. 
Brown in oven if desired. Serve rice as a vegetable. 

Mrs. I. H. Cadioallader. 

WILD DUCK ROASTED. 

It is well to have your duck lying in salt water about 1 to 2 
hours before roasting as it takes away the wild smell. Use the 
following recipe for dressing and bake 1 hour, basting often. 
Soak a cupful of stale bread in cold water, after it is soaked 
squeeze out as dry as possible, chop fine the liver and heart, fry a 
slice of onion in about a tablespoonful of butter, add 2 table- 
spoonsful of raisins, 1 egg, a little nutmeg, salt and pepper to 
taste, mix all together in a bowl and add a wineglass of sherry 
w ine.

take a large spoonful of grated chocolate, wet with very little 
boiling water and rubbed to a smooth paste. This will make a 
brown coloring, beat this into the second cup of mixture. A few- 
drops of fruit coloring stirred into the third cup, and the yolks 
of the eggs beaten stirred into the fourth cup. When cold and 
beginning to form pour carefully into a cool wet mold white first, 
then pink, yellow, and last the brown. This may be flavored to

into the water 1 cup of sugar and I/2 a cup of butter, grate a nut-

cient sauce for each. Take upon a platter and pour the sauce

CANNED FRUIT 



Fruits are best when served ripe, and in season. Should be 
cooked in earthen or granite ware. Use wooden spoon in stirring. 
Keep canned fruit in dark closet. After cans have been used once 
and before fruit is again put into them, they should be put into a 
kettle of water containing a handful of Sal-soda, which must be 
brought to a boil, let them cool in the water, rinse thoroughly in 
cold water, AMien fruit is hot the jar, cover and rubber should 
be hot. Mrs. Jennie M. Bull. 

In preparation of these non-metalic surfaces only should be 
allowed to come in contact with the materials employed. Fruits, 
are agreeable and refreshing, but as the proportion of water is 
high, and of nitrogenous matter low, they are of little nutritive 
value. When taken in moderation the}^ are very wholesome. 
Fruit is best eaten in the morning. 

CANNED CHEERIES. 

Use large red or white cherries. Wash, remove stems and 
pit, then follow directions for canning fruit. 

Mrs. Jennie M. Bull. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Select some fine, free-stone peaches, pare, cut in two and 
stone them. Have your mason jars ready and fill up with the 
peaches, then fill to the top w^ith the juice which you have pre- 
pared before hand. A half a cup of sugar to a cup of water. 
Now close up and stand your jars, in a large kettle of water and 
let this water boil for about 25 minutes, then close up air tight. 
Your peaches will remain like fresh peaches. 

Mrs. A. Ricketts. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Wipe peaches and allow them to stand in hot water long 
enough to loosen the skins. Allow two-thirds fruit to one-third 
sugar. 21/2 cups water to each pound of sugar; boil sugar and 
water ten minutes, then cook small quantity of fruit at a time in 
syrup. By so doing, fruit will keep its shape. 

Mrs. Jennie M. Bull.

CANNED PEACHES. 

Allow half a ijound of sugar to 1 lb. of peaches, and to every 6

main in the pan at back of the stove away from the strong heat 
until upon tipping the vessel up you can see some liquid, then fill 
the jars which you must have standing in a large pan of hot water 
(put in when cold), keep in a dark closet. The peaches should be 
ripe but not soft. Mi's. Lyle. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE.

3 scant pints of water, boil syrup five minutes and skim or strain 
if necessary, then add the fruit (which should be weighed after 
it is cut and ready to use) and let it boil up. have cans hot, fill and 
shut up as soon as possible. Use the best white sugar, cut the 
fruit 14 iiich thick. 

Pineapple, quince and all hard fruits should be cooked in 
boiling water until nearly soft, then put in syrup to finish cook- 
ing. Fill jars and seal as directed. While filling jars place them 
on a cloth rung out of hot water. Mrs. Jennie M . Bull. 

CANNED SKAWBERRIES. 

Allow 2 baskets to a qt. jar, put ^ lb. granulated sugar, 2 
tablespoonsful water on to boil until syrup will drop from spoon. 
Drop in fruit carefully, allow to boil about two minutes, then 
carefully skim out the fruit into the jars and fill to overflowing 
with hot syrup. Seal inunediately. 

Mrs. Jennie M. Bull. 

,CANNED TOMATOES. 

Use very ripe tomatoes. First put them in a large pan of 
boiling water to loosen the skins, which is then easily removed; 
then put the tomatoes into the kettle, set over a moderate fire and 
let them come to a boil. After they have boiled slowly one-half 
hour, they are put into jars whilst boiling hot and sealed tightly. 
Set in a cool dark closet. Be sure to fill the jars quite full, else 
they will not keep.

times while boiling and pour back through the ])ercolator, as this 
brings out the strength of the coffee. Coffee should not be al- 
lowed to stand and should be made just before serving. If pos-

BEEF TEA. 

This much abused article will Hiul its chief use in those weak 
conditions in which the patient needs stinudatino;. There is very 
little nourishment in it, but it seems to liave a remarkable jjower 
to sustain life out of all projiortion of the amount of solid matter 
which it contains. If a i)atient has a continued fever, and it is 
known that beef tea will be wanted from day to day, too much 
pains cannot be taken in its preparation. It is well to observe the 
following rules : 

Never let the beef tea boil. 

Always begin Avith cold water. 

The finer the beef is cut the better. 

There should be no fat. gi-istle or bones adhering to the meat. 

The proper proportion of beef and Avater is 1 pound to 1 pint. 

Beef tea that jellies when cold has not been properly made. 

After being made carefully remove from the surface all 
traces of fat. 

To Avarm u]) Beef tea, })ut in a cu]) and set cu]^ in a vessel of 
boiling water. 

Use folloAving rcci] e to get all the virtue of the meat : 

Take 1 lb. fresh beef, cut A^ery fine, soak in 1-3 qt. of cold 
Avater over night, keep on ice. In the morning remOA^e the meat 
saving the AAater in Avhich it has soaked, put the meat into 2-3 qt. 
of Avater and let it simmer for 2 hours, keeping the Avater up to its 
original level by replacing Avhat is lost by evaporation, using 
water of the same temperature. Xoav pour the beef broth into the 
liquor in Avhich the meat Avas soaked, squeezing the meat as dry as 
possible. 

The meat Avhicli remains should be spread on a porcelain })an 
and sloAvly dried in an open oven. 

^^'h(Ml perfectly dry it can easily be reduced to a ])OAV(ler in 
a mortar. Mix this meat })OAvder in a li([iior, and you have all the 
elements of the meats in a fluid form. Salt to taste and add 10 
drops of iiniriatic acid, and 3 grains of pepsin. This is the only 
prepartion of beef tea Avhich contains all the virtue of the meat. 
Other beef teas are stimulating but they haA^e no nutritiA-e value 
whatever. " Mrs. Paul Jones. 

BLACKBERRY JUICE. 

1 cup of juice, 1/2 cupful of sugar, 1-3 cupful of Avater. Let 
it come to a good boil, seal Avhile hot. Grape juice can be made 
the same Avay. Mrs. A. IF. Payne. 



THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. J93 

BEEF TEA. 

1 lb. loan beef chopped tine in a mason jar without any water. 
Seal tightly and place jar in a pot of cold water, bringing it slow- 
ly to a boil. When beef fibers separate, draw the juice into a cup 
and season to taste. This is very nourishing for the sick. 

Mrs. P. D. aunter. 

BUTTERMILK WITH E(;G. 

Beat up well one ^gg to a glass of buttermilk, a little salt or 
sugar as desired, is fine for kidney trouble. 

Mrs. P. G. Bezner. 

CHICKEN TEA. 

Cut in small pieces a chicken from Avhicli the skin and fat 
have been removed. Boil the pieces in 1 qt. of water, with a lit- 
tle salt for '20 minutes. The tea should be poured from the chick- 
en before the meat is quite cold.

Dr. M. •/. Helm, Long Beach, Col. 

EGG TOAST. 

Brown a slice of bread nicely and dip in hot water slightly 
salted, butter it, and lay on top an egg that has been broken into 
boiling water and cooked until the white is done. Season the 
egg with a bit of butter and a little salt. 

Mr.H. G. ^Y. Brown. 

The best way to cook an egg for an invalid is to drop it into 
hot water, or pour boiling water over it in the shell and let it 
stand for a few minutes on the back of stove. 

Mrs. G. W. Brown.

to a pulp. Add 4 tablespoonsful of either sherry or grape juice 
and fill the glass with seltzer. Shake, strain and serve with 
fresh mint protruding from the glass. 

Mrs. S. M. Green. 

MEAT EOR INVALIDS. 

Salted meat is objectionable, and is unsuitable for invalids. 
Beef and mutton are the innncij^le fresh meats. The foruier is 
richer in flavor, containing more iron and is more satisfying and 
more strengthening, but makes greater demands among the diges- 
tive powers. In many cases of illness it may be eaten with im- 
punity, but in I^nteric fever it produces injurious etfects. Even in 



THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. J95 

the form of beef tea it often increases the irritation, keeps np the 
fever, and aggravates the diarrhoea. Administered in a raw state 
and reduced to a pulp, it is very useful in some derangements. It 
has proved very valuable in Cholera Infantum, and Dysentery, 
when everything else has failed. Mutton or mutton broth is much 
preferred for delicate persons. Veal and lamb are more jellatin- 
ous. less stimulating, less nutritious and less easily digested than 
beef and mutton, and cannot be advised for the sick. 

Pork, on account of its fatness, is not. so easy of digestion as 
other meats. 

Bacon and ham do not easily disngree with the stomach but 
have no place in the sick room. 

Venison is lean, dark colored and savory, and is easily digest- 
ed by the dyspeptic and convalescent. 

Sweet bread is easily digested, and Avhen simply cooked is not 
unsuitable for the convalescent. 

Preserved meat is not so iioiirishiiig as the same amount 
of properly cooked fresh beef. 

Extracts of meat may often prove a temporary substitute for 
beef tea. but it must not supersede it in the sick room. 

Birds occupy an important place among the sources of food, 
especially in the diet of the sick room. 

Vegetable broth made of any ordinary market vegetable, in 
season, by boiling and straining, is useful as a substitute for ani- 
mal foods when the latter are not allowed. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Put about 4 lbs. of mutton, {not lamh,) neck piece preferred, 
in cold water enough to cover. Simmer, not boil, nearly all day, 
or until the meat is in shreds. Strain through a colander; place 
liquor in ice box over night. Next morning remove the grease 
W'hich has risen, being careful not to let any particles remain on 
the jelly. Keep jelly on ice. and when required for use, take I 
tablespoonful to Y2 cup of boiling water. Salt to taste, before 
serving. This is excellent for those suffering from dysenteric 
troubles. 

( )ATMEAL GRUEL. 

1 teacup of rolled oatmeal woU cooked and strained, through 

a fine sieve, 1/2 pt. milk, 1/2 pt. cream, heated, then add oatmeal, 

salt, sugar, and nutmeg if desired. 

Mrs. G. IF. Brown. 



J96 THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. 

RAW BEEF TEA. 

What is called iiiicookeil or raw beef tea. Only a little of 
this should be made at a time, as it sours quickly. Take one 
ounce of beef at a time, and as soon as one cupful is g;iven pre- 
pare the next. The beef should be from the top part of the round ; 
this must be cut across the grain, and shred down with a knife. 
For each ounce allow two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Let the 
meat soak fifteen minutes, and then the water will be colored with 
the juice. Use no salt, as this is given only to patients in very low 
condition. In summer it should be given cold. Indeed, at any- 
time, the colder the better ; but if it should be desired, allow it to 
warm just enough to remove the chill, but on no account must it 
boil. 

SLIPPERY ELM TEA. 

A teaspoonful of powdered slippery elm in a tumbler, pour 
on cold Avater and season with lemon and sugar. 

Mrs. G. ^Y. Brown. 

TAPIOCA GRUEL. 

A scant teacup of tapioca soaked and cooked until well done. 
Take % pt., of milk and 14 pt. of cream, heat and stir into tapioca. 
Season w^ith sugar or salt, and nutmeg. More milk can be used 
if desired. Mrs. G. IF. Brown. 

TOAST. 

Toast a slice of bread a nice brown, being careful not to let it 
burn. Put into a bowl and pour over it enough boiling water 
to cover. Cover the bowl and let stand, then add a little piece 
of ice. When cool give to patient by teaspoonful. 

Mrs. G. IF. Brown. 

TOAST WATER. " 
Bread for toast water should be toasted as brown as possible 
without burning, and covered with boiling water. When cold 
strain off the water and sAveeten if desired. It may also be flav- 
ored with a little orange or lemon peel.

Household Suggestions 

A GOOD WAY TO AVASH AVHITE SILK GLOVES 

i& to rub them well in lukewarm water, to which a little ammonia 
has been added, and rinse quickly in clear water of the same tem- 
perature. Hang them Avhere they will dry rapidly, and then put 
them between sheets of white paper and under a weight. Treated 
in this way they will not turn yellow. 

A GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR A FRENCH SEAM 

is to place together, on the wrong side, the tAvo edges of the gar- 
ment which are to be sewed, and run them through the medium 
hemmer of the sewing machine, thus making one row of stitching 
do as well as two would. T.J. 

A SUGGESTION. 

A tablespoonful of butter rubbed in a teaspoonful of flour 
and added to your hot stewed gooseberries, will add greatly to the 
flavor and make them much more delicious. 

Mrs. II. M. PUUhuri/. 

AN OUTDOOR CUPBOARD 

was made by a handy woman this way : Outside the kitchen win- 
dow a frame was made of boards a foot wide ; lighter boards were 
inserted for shelves, and nailed fast to the sides of the frame. 
The entire outside of this skeleton cupboard was then covered with 
wire netting. The kitchen window formed the door. Before 
and after the ice season such a cupboard will be found very useful 
for storing meat and ''left-overs. ' which Avould spoil if left in 
the kitchen. 

CARPET WxVSH. 

1 bar of ivoy soap dissolved in 1 gallon of hot water, 4 ozs. 
borax, 4 ozs. salsoda, stir until ingredients are dissolved, tiien add 
4 gallons of warm water, and i/o pt. of alcohol. Use a brush, 
wash a small spot of the carpet at a time and wipe dry as you 
can with a clean woolen cloth. Mrs. Robert E. Smith. 



J98 THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. 

CINDERS OR DUST IN THE EYE. 

Evelyn G. To remove a particle of dust from the eye, use a 
bit of tissue-paper twisted to a point and dampened. This paper 
is softer even than a fine handkerchief and ma}^ be used for re- 
moving the foreign body with but slight discomfort. 

COLD CREAM. 

Melt (j drachms each, white wax and spermaceti with 4 oz. of 
sweet almond oil over hot water, add II/2 oz. glycerine to "1 oz. 
orange flower water, and put 2 ozs. of borax in this to dissolve. 
Add this to the melted oils, and perfume with 15 drops each of 
oil of neroli, petit grain and bigarade, this will be much better if

DANDRUFF PROBABLY DUE TO A MICROBE. 

D. J. L. Dandruff is generally considered to be a germ dis- 
ease due to a microbe, which is probably in the pores of the skin 
as well as in the hair sac or root. A useful ointment consists of 
one drachm of precipitated sulphur to one ounce of vaseline. 
This is applied to the scalp and nuiy be left for several days. 

FOR A ,COUGH. 

V2. cnp of flax seed, -1 qts. of water boil 1 hour, strain through 
a cloth, add i/o cup of sugar and the juice of 3 lemons. 

Mrs. P. G. Bezner. 

FOR THE HANDS. 

1 nail cleaner. 1 bottle of lemon juice (have lemon juice 5 
parts and alcohol 1 part). Anothe,!- bottle with lotion: 14 o^- 
of gum tragacanth added to 1 pint of rain water which has stood 
3 days, then 1 ounce each of glycerine, alcohol and witch-hazel, 
also add a little good delicate perfume. Apply lemon juice, then 
the lotion. Mrs. II. M. Pillshnri/. 

FOR THE HANDS. 

For perspiration, moisten the hands several times a day with 
a mixture of 5)0 grams of cologne, and 50 grams of tincture of 
Belladonna. When bathing the hands use the purest soap and 
thoroughly rinse. 



THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. - J99 

FOR THE TEP:TH. 

Use precipitated chalk for bni>hing the teeth once a day. 
Use Barry's Antiseptic to remove soreness from tlie o-nms. 
Use often Listerine dihited as an antiseptic. 

FOR TRAVELERS. 

Always carry a bottle of Violet watt'r for cleaninu' the face. 
On a soft coal route the skin gets dirty and the water in the dress- 
ing room, which ahvays is hard, leaves it as black as it finds it, 
while the alcohol in the Violet water readily removes the dirt. 
This has been repeatedly tested, and when one has occasion to go 
directly from the train to some social function, and wishes not to 
be grimy but presentable, this will be found to be a useful bit of 
information. 

FOR THE HAHJ. 

To cure dandruti', use ten grains of corrosive sublimate, and 
5 ozs. distilled witch hazel. Use a dropper to apply it at night, 
and a bit of absorbent cotton to rub it in thoroughly but not- 
hard. Sometimes it takes little of this, sometimes it takes more. 
It is always well to use it once a week. 

To thicken and nourish the hair use crude ])etroleum. It is 
far the best to promote a growth where there is no dandrutf. 
Use it every night and nuissage. The odor soon passes oif, and 
the petroleum in its crude state is not greasy. 

FOR THE FACE AND NECK ALMOND MEAL IS EX- 
CELLENT IN PLACE OF SOAP. 

4 ounces of powdered orris root, 4 oz. wheat flour 1 oz. powd- 
ered castile soap, 1 oz. of borax, all in Hne powder. 10 drops of 
the oil of bitter almond, 2 fluid drachms of the oil of btu-gamont, 
mix well and strain through cheese cloth. 

FOR THE E^ ES. 

2 or H drops of essence of peppermint, is excellent to remove 
slight inflammation from the eyes, and is soothing and cooling. 
Use in a wine glass of water. Boric acid dissolved in water is 
also excx^llent for the eyes. Bathe the eyes frequently in cold 
water, doing so 3 times a day for 5 minutes will strcMigthen and 
preserve them.

HOW TO LOOK NEAT WHILE DOING HOUSEWORK 

is a problem every woman tries to solve for herself. Here is one 
way to do it : In the morning arrange your hair carefully, and 
put on a Avhite shirtw^aist and a short, dark skirt. AVliile getting 
breakfast, and afterward, when you are alone, wear a gingham 
apron made like a child's, and buttoned up the back. Have the 
apron quite large and with full sleeves gathered to a band at the 
wrist. Have a large pocket in the apron. In this way the dress 
may be kept entirely covered, and when the apron is removed one 
is neat in appearance for the husband's return or for the chance 
visitor.

KEEP CLEAN THE PLATES EKOM WHICH YOUR PETS 

EAT 

if you want A-our dogs and cats to he well. P>otli animals have a 
keen sense of smell, and a sour plate is often the cause of their 
lack of appetite. Have a distinctive sort of dish for the animals, 
so that it will not be mixed with others in the house. 

PAINT DARK CIX)SETS WHITE 

and it will be an easy nuitter to tell if they are clean. Too many 
houses have dark closets in bedroom, kitchen, hall or bathroom. 
They are often overlooked in the weekly cleaning and are a ''thorn 
in the flesh," of the neat housekeeper. Finish them all with white 
paint — floors, walls and shelves — and they will be an inspiration 
to cleanliness. L. M. M. 

MAKING TOILET SOAP AT HOME. 
R. L. K. Soap can be made at home, but in order to have it 
pay it must be made in large quantities. Before it is used it 
should be dried thoroughly. AMiy do you not try using oatmeal 
on your hands for a time? Keep a jar of the dry oatmeal on the 
washstand. Every time you wash your hands use the meal, rub- 
bing it over the hands like soap. It both softens and cleanses the 
skin. 

SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR AVOIDINC; BILIOUSNESS. 

Safi'ron. In the first place chew your food well. Do not 
hurry over your meals. If you have little time do not eat so 
much, but eat it slowly. Avoid all indigestible dishes, rich grav- 
ies, sweets, tea and coffee. Eat sparingly of meat. Eat plenty 
of fruit. Plain apple juice is often beneficial. A cool bath in 
the morning with vigorous rubbing, well- ventilated rooms both 
day and night, and outdoor air will all help you to overcome the 
tendency to "biliousness."' 

TO CURE HOUSEMAID'S KNEE. 

Domestic. Housemaid's knee is sometimes cured by keeping 
off the knees, Avhile the afflicted member is firndy bandaged. But 
in many cases the fluid which has collected must be drawn oft' by 
means of a needle. This must be done by a skillful physician. 

TONIC FOR THE HAIR. 

2% grains of quinine. 1 drachm of cacliarides and V^ pint of 
bav rum, with a little strong sage tea used at the same time. 



202 THE ST. LOUIS COOK BOOK. 

HEALTH SUGCiESTIONS. 

A pint of liike warm water Avith a pinch of salt in it.if drunk 
before breakfast, will cure many cases of indio^estion and stom- 
ach trouble. Mrs. Thos. J. AMns. 

For acute indigestion, 1 teaspoonful of Brown's Jamaica (lin- 
ger taken in I/2 glass of warm water in which 1/0 teaspoonful of 
sugar has been dissolved. J/r.y, Thos. J. Akins. 

1 teaspoonful of '"Spirits of Camphor" diluted with 5 tea- 
spoonsful of water and a little sugar, will positively cure the most 
ulcerated form of soar throat or tonsilitis if the throat is swabbed 
every half hour. Always use a new mixture and a new swab for 
each application, as the use of it once renders it unfit for the pa- 
tient a second time. 

The same proportion of alcohol used alternately secures good 
results with ulcerated soar thi'oats. Mrs. Thos. J. Akhis. 

iCloths wrung from hot water will relieve inflammation of 
the bowels or stomach if continued for several hours. This will 
often prevent appendicitis. Mrs. Thos. J. Akins. 

Vomiting or nausea can be released by a little cayenne pep- 
per, about what will go on a lOct. piece in half glass of milk, 
drink nothing cold. Mrs. P. G. Bezner. 

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

1. Alcohol will take out grease. 

2. Tough meat may be made tender by sprinkling with vine- 
gar. 

'^. Hold a hot flat iron a few mimites above a white spot on 
furniture. It will soon disappear. 

4. Iced alum water is good for a steam burn — keeping burn 
covered well with soft cotton. 

5. Kerosene oil and a soft cloth will keep nudioganv furn- 
iture in fine condition. 

For a moth and dust proof cover for dress suits and woolen 
clothes, make 'large bags of unbleached muslin. Put drawing 
strings at top and bottom. Soak them in turpentine and hang 
in the open air until the odor is destroyed. Place the clothes on 
a hanger, adjust and draw the strings tightly. These bags have 
also been successfully used in storing furs for the summer.

A little ground coffee sprinkled on the back part or a little 
vinegar kept boiling on the stove while onions or cabbage are 
cooking will prevent the disagreeable odor from going through 
the house. 



TOILET. 

One who wishes to keep her skin smooth and free from min- 
ute dry scales, will mask it with a good cold cream before going- 
out of doors. Put on a thick coating of the cream, massaging it 
well. Gently wipe off with an old linen handkerchief any that 
shows, after which dust over with powder, and wear a veil. 
When done so, there is no appearance of make-up, but the skin is 
thoroughly protected from the winds. 

,Chiff'on make the best veil. It may be white or any color 
provided the eyes will not feel any strain. 

A Good Cold Cream. A cream with cucumber juice should 
always be used when it is possible, as it softens and whitens also. 
The cucumber should be ripe enough to use at the table. Cut 
into bits, peel and all, put several into a porcelain kettle, with 
just as little Avater as is needed to prevent scorching, simmer until 
mushy. Strain through a sieve, and again through cheese cloth. 
An essence is made of this that preserves it by adding an equal 
quantity of alcohol, and reduce to a powder a quarter of an ounce 
of olive oil soap, add this to three ounces of the essence and let

plain cucumber juice and shake until mixed well, have 4 oz. sweet 
almond oil in china bowl, pour in the mixture and add 3 quarters 
of a drachm of tincture of benzoin. Perfume as desired. Stir 
until creamy. If as little water as possible is used in preparing 
the cucumber, it will give all its good qualities to this excellent 
cream. 

TOILET.

face until dry, leaves a beautiful velvet surface, and no appear- 
ance of powder. Can be made in i/2 or 1-^ quantity: IV2 lbs.

WHAT TO READ. 

If you have the ''bhies." read the twenty-seventh Psahn. 

If people seem unkind, read the fifteenth chapter of John. 

If you are discouraged about your work, read the one hun- 
dred twenty-sixth Psahn. 

If you can't have your own way in everything, keep silent 
and read the third chapter of James. 

If you are losing confidence in men, read the thirteenth chap- 
ter of First Corinthians. 

AVHEX ^lATEKIAL IS TO BE CUT AWAY UNDER LACE. 

use a piece of pasteboard four inches long, rounded at one end, 
and cut wide enough to slip along between the lace and material. 
This will make tlie work easier and safer. Missouri. 

Canteloupe and Avatermelon must be served very cold, that 
they may not contaminate the contents of the refrigerator. Avhile 
they are becoming chilled they should be wrapped in paraffin 
paper, a supply of which can be bought for one dollar, and which 
keeps in perfect condition nil fcxxl likely to suffer by contamina- 
tion. 

A THOUGHT FOR THE YOUX(f HOUSE-KEEPER. 

The sweet 3'Oung girl who has just assumed the responsibility 
of a partnership business by getting married is confronted with 
many perplexing problems, that fortunately she never dreamed 
of when mother solved them and father paid the bills. 

If you will inaugurate a system of order upon entering this 
stage of life it will mitigate many annoyances sparing you time 
and trouble. 

Remember that we are habitors. that is when \\t' have be- 
come accustomed to seeing and doing things a certain way it is 
ver}' hard to correct' them. If men did not have method and or- 
der in their business, would we not have many more business 
failures? Then we should know the purpose or object of our busi- 
ness, pardon the word business, I use it for the want of something 
better that will express what I want to say. For the home should 
be considered so sacred, that women should look upon it as far

superior in ewrv aspect to aiiytliiiio- that is suiiirestive of business. 
Ill the first place study, what is her hope and aim is it not to make 
the best man in the world a place of (piiet retreat when he comes 
home tired from business worries, all the people he has come in 
contact witli to-day is not sweet to him like you are. your home 
may be a little cottaov. a residence, a mansion, it makes little diif- 
erence if love dwells there. 

He has or should have spent the day faithfully looking after 
his business alfairs. Now you are the vice-president and the 
treasurer of this little Corporation and you are just as anxious to 
perform your duties as carefully and as he does his. \ on now 
enjoy the same class of individuals that we call friends, your tastes 
are similar, you like to consult each other's views and please each 
other, allowing each to have their own opinion about things. 

Bv doing this you are free from the busy class of meddler- 
\vho never made any one better but like all evils are a necessity to 
all connnunities. for did they not exist the true wonuin could not 
be appreciated as she is by her husband and friends. 

So I shoidd suggest that you avoid this class of women. 
There is a great deal said against women's clubs, now my idea is 
that clubs like tr\ists are both good and bad, that is some are good 
and some are bad. The Club should be an incentive for higher 
likes and higher ideas,as women exchange their ideas and o[)iuious 
and discuss interesting and helpful subjects when they meet, they 
often display art and beauty in dress that is a helj) to all and a 
necessity as women should make themselves as attractive as i)os- 
sible. If you W\n\ that you are not benefited by the society of a 
Club in wliicli you lia\e become a member you can cpiietly with- 
draw, but if you hnd out that it has helped you to see a better side 
of life and not conflicted Avith your home duties by all means keep 
up your obligation towards it. This is your business. Tn these 
days of stupendous business competition, many intricacies arise, 
about the finances of a family, would it not be wise to come to some 
agreement \\\n)\\ a fixed sum of a portion of your income for house- 
hold and personal expenses [)utting aside an t>mergencv fund, (for 
you will often have to resort to this). If the income is ^mall man- 
age to save a little for a rainy day. This suggestion is only made 
for the beneht of those who ha\"e limited income. For the rich 
who have ac(|uired great wealth have no need of suggestion along 
this line. And the poorer classes that i> the masses of the people 
should not criticise their extravagances. It is commendable in 
the rich when they >i)end their money generously. It is human to

desire and want the beautiful and the luxuries, and they should 
have them, but uuAvise to envy or live beyond our own income. 
The Great Ingersol said a Avise thing when he said that the rich 
should spend more money and the poor should spend less. Meet 
all your obligations promptly, you will take pleasure in this when 
you once acquire the habit. And remember that true happiness 
comes from a sense of knowing and doing our duty.

^So it is with the fiae aroma of butter. The 
time which butter stays iu a grocery store, in 
the jobber's hands and the one to seven days in 
the creamery where it is made and shipped once 
a week means great loss in flavor, if other 
makes of butter were as fine as ours (not a fact) 
when fresh from the churn by the time you 
spread it on your daily bread it has lost much 
of its freshness and can not compete with ours. 
^ Place with us a standing order for 3, 4 or 5 
pounds a week of "Hoard's Gilt Edge Butter" 
made to your order, salted, half salted or fresh, 
colored with harmless vegetable color or uncol- 
ored, packed in a special package with your 
name and address, and before it is an hour out 
of the churn it is on its way to you to be deliv- 
ered at your residence by our wagons in about 
48 hours from the churn, in original package.

A TRULY AMERICAN BAPTIST PAPER 

The Central Baptist 



is in a Class by itself 



Every department of the denominational life 
receives attention at the hands of its editors 



It knows no North, no South, no East, no West among Baptists. 

It stands for and pushes the work of them all. 

It is not local in its record of denominational domgs. 

Its contributed articles are from the best pens in the denomination. 

It is thoroughly orthodox and yet conservatively fair, and even those who 
may not endorse fully all of its positions cannot do otherwise than admire its 
policy of straightforward candor. 

A Colorado pastor says: "THE CENTRAL BAPTIST contains more 
missionary information than can be found anywhere else. It has all that any 
paper in the North has and all that any paper in the South has. It is thoroughly 
representative of every mission interest and enterprise." 

Its treatment of the Sunday-school lesson and Sunday-school work is unique. 
The Hon. E. W. Stephens is now on a tour of the world. He will return 
shortly, when it is expected that he will resume his inimitable treatment of the 
lessons. Sunday-school work, Sunday-school methods, Sunday-school interests 
are covered in the department "Sunday-school Methods." 

No less careful work is done for the B Y. P. U. 

The women's societies of America make free use of its columns to exploit 
their work. 

"Our Home" page is brimful of good things for the boys and the girls. 
"The Children's Corner" delights the younger ones. 

The range of the news department is comprehensive In fact THE CEN- 
TRAL BAPTIST is worthy the attention of pastors. Christian workers, and 
those who would have the best throughout the denomination everywhere. 

If you are not acquainted with THE CENTRAL BAPTIST send for 
sample copies. You wiJI then subscribe.

SHREDDED WHOLE WHEAT 

for the Housekeeper to lean upon in every emergency. Ready- 
cooked, ready-to-serve, it contains all of the nutritive elements of 
the whole wheat, steam-cooked and drawn into fine porous 
shreds so that the stomach may easily take up all its strength 
giving properties. See Shredded Wheat Recipes in this Book.
