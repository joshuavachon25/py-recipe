In compiling the iollowlLii.-. ■■:0i% the pubhsher \m>' 
had but one necessaiv o'v t, in the undertaking. 
From experience he h.is set;;i .ho want of a decided 
GmadisiTivade-mecimi of coohery. He therefore, 
endeavors in this publication to secure all the 
desiderata of a Housewife's culinary knowledge,and 
herewii;h presents before her ni<. array of Receipts 
unequalled, as a whole, to any thing hitlierto pu))- 
lished in this country. 

There are certainly many publications of the 
same class as the one now belore tt\e reader, but 
as they all invariably have a cosmopolitan character, 
a work more restricted and withal U>eal in its aim, 
was much required. This deficiency, it will be 
seen, is herein fully supplied. 

The present work therefore undertakes to meet 
the wants and views of tlie Canadian Housewife- 
There is scarcely an article m the shape of the 
manufacture of Sauces, the preparations of Fish, 
the various uses, purposes, and dressing of Meat ; 
the minutiae of Poultry, Game, and Pastry, but

PREFACE. 

what the subsequent pages detail ; and, in addition, 
many valuable recipes for the sick and convalescent 
are given. 

The compiler would also call attention to the 
excellent rules and maxims laid down in the 
** Introductory Observations "—a careful study 
of which will be found to be of the most essential 
service in house-keeping. 

As Carving is a requisite accomplishment at 
the table, full and complete directions for the 
mastery of this art is annexed, with illuBtrations. 

In all these various departments, the compiler 
has been somewhat indebted to a late work of M. 
Soybr's, the celebrated French Cook, as well as 
to some of the latest English, French, and Ameri- 
can works on the same subject ; and having thus 
carefully culled and collated from these source.-^ all 
that was valuable and appUcable to this country, he 
most respectfully submits the same for the approval 
and patronage of the Canadian Housewife.

DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 



Addrebs ismore require'l than strenijlh in the inantier uf 
usiiiff the carvinjj knife, which, for a lady, ahouid be light ; 
of a middling size and a keen edge ; to facilitate carving, 
the butcher should always be desired to divide the joints 
of all carcase meat. If the meat belonging to ei'di bone 
be to<» thick, a small slice may be taken between every 
two bones. The more fleshy joints are to be helped in 
ihin slices, smoothly cut. The dish should not be too far 
off the carver, as it makes the task more difficult, and 
gives an awkward appearance. 

In helping flsh, care should be taken not to break the 
flakes, which in cod and fresh salmon are large, and add 
much to the beauty of its appearance. A fish slice not 
being sharp, divides it best on this account. Part of the 
roc, liver or milt, should be helped to each person. 

In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose or turkey, for 
a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to 
pinion, withomt making wings, there will be more prime 
pieces. 

Cod^s Head and Shoulders. 




This fish when in season and properly boiled, makes a 
very handsome dish. The parts about the back-bone, on 
the shoulders, are the best. Take off a piece down to 
the bone in the direction a, b^ c, d, putting in the spooB

by putting the spoon mto the mouth. 

Edge-bone of beef. 




Cut off a slice an inch thick all the lengh from a, to *, 
and then help. The soft fat. which resembles marrow, 
lies at the back of the bone, below c ; the firm fat must 
be cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the meat d. It 
is proper to ask which is preferred, as tastes differ. The 
skewer that keeps the meat properly together, when boil- 
ing, is here shown at a. 

Sirloin op Beef.— Begin either at the end, or by cut- 
ting into the middle. For the outside, the slice should be 
cut down to the bones. Give with each piece some of 

the soft fat. „ ^, « 

The inside, done as follows, eats excellently t—Havc 
ready some shalot-vinegar boiling hot ; mince the meat 
large, and a good deal of the fat ; sprinkle it with salt, 
and pour the shalot-vinegar and the gravy on it. Help 
as quickly as possible, on hot plates. 

Round or Buttock of BEEF.--Cut in the same way as 
fillet of veal. It should be kept even all over. A deep 
slice should be cut off the beef before you begin to help, 
as directed above for the edge-bone. 



DIRKOTIONS FOR CARVING. 



Ill 




FiLLBT OF Veal. — In an ox this part is round of beef. 
I Ask whether the brown be liked, otherwise help the next 
ilice. The bone is taken out and the meat tied close, 
before dressing. It should be cut thin and very smooth. 
I A stuffing is put into the flap which completely covers it ; 
you must cut deep into this, and help a thin slice, as like- 
wise of fat. 

Brkast of Vkal.— One part (which is calle,; the brisket) 
is thick set, and has gristles : put your knife about four 

[inches from the edge of this, and cut through it, which 
will separate the ribs from the brisket. Ask which is 

|chosen, and help accordingly. 

Oalf'8 Head. — Cut slices from the fleshy part, at the 
neck end, there lies the throat sweetbread, which you 
should help a slice of with the other part. Many like the 
eye : which you must cut out with the point of your knife, 
and divide In two. If the jaw-bone be taken off, there 
will be found some fine lean. Under the head is the 
palate. 

Shoulder of Mutton. 




This is a good joint, and by many preferred to the ler, 
lit being full of gravy. The flgure represents it as laid m 
[the dish with its back uppermost. When cut, it should be 
[in the hollow part of it, in the direction of a, 6, and the 
[knife be passed deep to the bone. The prime part of the 
[at lies on the outer edge, in the direction /, g. If Um

A lea of wether mutton may be known by a round lump 
of fat at the edge ot the broadest part, as at a. Ihe best 
part is in the midway, at b, between tlie ivnuckle and

Jt Fore-quarter of Lamb, 



V 




Separate the shoulder from the scoven, (which is the 
breast and ribs) by passing? the knife under in the direction 
of a, V, c, d, keeping it towards you horizontally, to pre- 
vent cutting the meat too much off the bones. If grass 
lamb, the shoulder being large, put it into another dish. 
Then separate the gristly part from the ribs in the line «, 
e; and help either from that, or from the ribs, as may be 
chosen. 

Hani. 




Ham may be cut three ways: the common method is, 
to begin in the middle, by long slices from a, to &, from 
the centre through the thick fat. This brings to the 
prime at first; which is likewise accomplished by cutting

Sucking Pig- 




The cook usually divides the body before it is sent to 
table, and garnishes the dish with the jaws and ears. 

The first thing is, to separate a shoulder from the car- 
case on one side, and then the leg, according to the direc- 
tion ffiven by the dotted line a, b,c. The ribs are then to 
be divided into about two helpings ; and an ear or jaw pre- 
sented with them, and plenty of sauce. The joints may 
either be divided into two each, or pieces may be cut from 
them. The ribs are reckoned the finest part. 

Goose, 




Cut off the apron in the circular line a, ft, c, and pour 
into the body a glass of port wine ; and a large tea-spoon- 
ful of mustard. Turn the neck end of the gooie towards' 



you.

e towards* 



you, and cut the whole breast in long slices from one wing 
to another ; but only remove them as you help eaeh person, 
unless the company is so large as to require the legs like- 
wise. Take off the leg, by putting the fork into the small 
end of the bone, pressing it to the body, and having passed 
the knife at d, turn the leg back, and, if a young bird, it 
will easily separate. To take off the wing, put your fork 
into the small end of the pinion, and press it close to the 
body ; then put in the knife at d^ and divide the joint, 
taking it down in the direction d, e. Nothing but practice 
will enable people to hit the joint exactly at first. When 
the leg and wing of one side are done, go on to the other ; 
but it is not often necessary to cut up the whole oroose, 
unless the company be large. There are two side-bones 
by the wing, which may be cut off, as likewise the back . 
and lower^si de-bones ;'but the best pieces are the breast, 
and the thighs after being divided from the drum-sticks. 

Hare. 




The best way of cutting it up is, to put the pomt ot the 
knife under the shoulder at a, and so cut all the way down 
to ^\iQ rump, on one side of the back-bone, at the line a, 
i. Do the same on the other side, so that the whole hare 
will be divided into three parts. Cut the back into four, 
which, with the legs, is the i)art most esteemed. Ihe 
shoulder must be cut off in a circular line, as c, a, a ; and 
help the company, giving some pudding and gravy to 
every person. This wav can only be practised when the

manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken oflf, and the

wings, breast, and merrythought, but the bird bemg small, 
the two latter are not often divided. The wing is con- 
sidered as t^l best, and the tip of it reckoned the most 
delicate moilel of the whole. 

Pigeons.— Cut them in half either from top to bottom 
or across. The lower part is generally thought the best ; 
but the fairest way is to cut from the neck down the back.

miRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS 

FOR THE USE OF 

THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. 



*' Those deserve the greatest praise who best acquit themtelyes of th« 
duties which their station requires." 



[The following pructi 
work entitled *** 



hints are 

t«8tic 



are abridged from a rery valnabl« English 
Cookery.''] 



In the variety of female acquirements, though domestic 
occupations stand not so high in esteem as they formerly 
did, yet, Ewhen neglected, they produce much human mi- 
sery. There was a time when ladies knew nothing beyond 
their own family concerns ; but, in the present day, there 
are many who know nothing about them ; each of these 
extremes should be avoided. But is there no way to 
unite jin the female character, cultivation of talents and 
habits of usefulness? Happily there are still great num- 
bers in every situation, whose example proves that this is 
possible. How necessary then is domestic knowledge in 
those whose limited means press on their attention con- 
siderations of economy. 

If we carry on our observations to married life, we shall 
find a love of employment to be the source of unnumbered 
pleasures. To attend to the nursing, and at least early in- 
struction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the 
ways of piety and usefulness : to preside over the family 
and regulate the income allotted to its maintenance : to 
make home the sweet refuge of a husband fatigued by in- 
tercourse with a jarrinsr world : to be his enlightened conix 
panion and the chosen friend of his heart : these, are wo- 
man's duties, and delightful jones they are, if haply she be 
married to a man whose soul can duly estimate her worth, 
and who will bring his share to the common stock of fe^ 
licity. Of such a woman, one may truly say, " Happy the

ThA manner of carving is not only a very necessary 
br^ch of TXmation, to^enable a lady t<> do the ^^on^^^^^^

consumption of a family. 

The mistress of a family should always remember that

one wec'i, the next must repay it. The general will have 
no public day this week." The fault was never repeated. 

To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted ; for people 
ought to form their conduct from their circumstances, but 
It is presumed that a judicious arrangement, according to 
them, will be found equally advantageous to all. 

By good hours, especially early breakfast, a family it 
more regular, and much time is saved. If oiders be given 
soon in the morning, there will be mere time to execute 
them ; and servants, by doing their work with ease, will 
be more equal to it, and fewer will be necessary. 

It is worthy of notice that the general expense will be 
reduced and much time saved, if every thing oe kept in its 
proper place, applied to its proper use, and mended, when 
the nature of the accident will allow, as soon as broken. 

All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness ; 
sugars of diflferent qualities kept broken, currants washed, 
picked and perfectly dry ; spices pounded, and kept In very 
small bottles closely corked ; not more than will be used 
in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much 
less is necessary when boiled whole in gravies, &c. 

It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the 
good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the 
mistress and servants of great houses will hereafter be cal- 
led to a strict account. 

Some part of every person's fortune should be devoted 
to charity ; by which a " pious woman will build ujp her 
house before God, while she that is foolish (a. e. ^ends no- 
thing to the Lord) pulls it down with her hands." No one 
can complain of the want of gifts to the poor in this land ; 
but there is a mode of relief which would add greatly to 
their comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity, 
and such materials as are often thrown away, the ezpensa 
would not be felt. 

Many well-meaning servants are ignorant of the best 
means of managing, and thereby waste as much as would 
maintain a small family, besides causing the mistress of 
the bous^ much chagrin by their irregularity ; and znapj

inff space between, and let it grow hard gradually. Thus 
it will save a full third in the consumption. 

Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice shoil 
be pared first to preserve the peel dry ; some should be 
halved, and when squeezed, the pulp cut out, and the out- 
sides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the 
first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a proper 
Quantity should be bought and prepared as above directed, 
especially by those who live in the country, where they 
cannot always be had; and they are perpetually wanted in 
cookery. 

When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purpos- 
es contrive to have pudding, custard, »fec. to employ the 
volks also. Should you not want them for several hours, 
beat them up with a little water, and put them in a cool 
Dlace, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a 
mistake of old, to think that the whites made cakes and 
nuddings heavy ; on the contrary, if beaten long and 
separately, thev contribute greatly to give lightness, are 
an advantage to paste, and make a preti^ dish beaten 
with fruit, to set in cream, &c. 

If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should 
be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed 
off- and to have them fresh done when the least defect ap- 
pears, and never to put by any soup, gravy, &c., in them, 
or any metal utensil ; stone and earthen vessels should be 
nrovided for those purposes, as likewise plenty of common 
dishes, that the table set may be used to put by cold meat. 

Tin vessels if kept damp, soon rust, which cause holes. 
Fenders, and tin linings of flower-pots, ifec. should be pain- 
ted every year or two. 

Do not let knives be dropped into hot dish-water. It is 
a eood plan to have a tin pot to wash them m, just high 
enough to wash the blades without wetting the handles. 

A bowl containing a quart of water, set in an oven when 
baking, will prevent pies, cakes, &c. from being scorched. 

Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed 
red war©, by which a strong poison is produced.

Vinegar, by its acidity, does the same, tlie glazing being 
of lead or arsenic. 

To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, 
and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place 
it in the sun ; renew the process once or twice. 

The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is II 
a stone jar on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel 
into a saucepan of water, called a water-bath. 

If chocolate, coffee jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered to 
boll over, the strength is lost. 

The cook should be charged to take care of jelly-bags, 
tapes for the collared things, &c. which if not perfectly 
scalded and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when 
next used. 

Cold water thrown on cast-iron, when hot, will cause it 
to crack. 

In the following receipts, though the quantities may be 
accurately directed, yet much must be left to the discre- 
tion of the person who uses them.

of the flavour of spices Bait, garlic, butter, &c. which can 
never be ordered by ge •v-a! rules; and if the cook has 
not a good taste, all t'li :'*ijci\ iients niiich nature and art 
can furnish, will not give exquisite flavour to her dishes. 
The proper articles should be at hand, and she must pro- 
portion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety 
in flavour be given at the same time to the different dishes 
served.

PART I. 

SIMPLIFIED RULES FOR SOUPS, BROTHS AND 

GRAVIES. 

The Keader will doubtless be aware that the 
principal reason why a great number of the peo- 
ple in this country dislike the making of soup, 
18 the expense attending the purchase of the ne- 
cessary ingredients laid down in the generality 
of receipt books. In the following pages refer- 
ence has been carefully studied to obviate this 
disadvantage; and the compiler, therefore, has 
no hesitation in. recommending the receipts here- 
with given for that purpose, not only as being 
highly wholesome and nutritious, but likewise 
simple in preparation and economical in mate- 
rial, so that soup may form a part of the daily 
fare of every dinner table. 



General Directions respecting Soups and Gravies, 

When there is any fear of gravy-meat being 

spoilt before it is wanted, season well and fry it

lightly, which will preserve it two <^ay8 longer ; 
but the gravy is best when the jmces are fresh. 

When soups or gravies are to be put by, let 
them be changed every day into fresh scalded 
pans. Whatever has vegetables ^ boiled m it is 
apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. 
Never keep any gravy, cfec, in metal. 

When fat remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of 
aour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled 
in, will take it off. 

If richness or greater consistency be wanted 
a good lump of butter mixed with Aour, and 
boiled in the soup, will give either of these 
qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the 
full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time 
should be allowed for soups andgravie.; and 
they are best if made the day before they are 
wanted. 

Soups and gravies are far better when the 
meat is put at the bottom of the pan and stewed, 
and the herbs, roots, &c., with the butter than 
when water is put to the meat at first ; and the ^ 
eravv that is drawn from the meat should be 
llmost dried up before the water is P^t to it.- 
Do not use the sediment of gravies, &c., that have 
stood to be cold. When onions are strong boi a 
turnip with them, if for sauce; this will make 
them mild. 

If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover 
them in boiling, that the watery particles may 
evaporate.

A clear jelly of cow-heel is very useful to 
keep in the house, being a great improvement 
to soups and gravies. 

Truffles and morels thicken soups and sauces, 
and give them a fine flavour. Wash half an 
ounce of each carefully, then simmer them a few 
minutes in water, and add them with the liquorj 
to boil in the sauce, <fec., till tender. 



Please pay attention to the following receipt 
for when you are perfect in it, and can make it 
quick and well, almost every sort of soup can be 
made from it, and it will often be referred to in 
different sauces and dishes. — Soyer. 

Stock Broth for Clear Soup. 

1. Cut two pounds of knuckle or scrag of veal 
into small pieces, place them in the iron pot or 
stewpan, with two ounces of salt butter or drip- 
ping, two ounces of lean bacon cut small, three 
tea-spoonfuls of salt, half a spoonful of pepper, a 
gill of water, three middle-sized or six ounces of 
onions, sliced. Put on the fire; when boiling, 
stir it for about ten minutes, or until it forms a 
►whitish thick gravy at the bottom, or gets rather 
dry, then add five pints of hot or cold 
water ; when boiling, let it simmer gently for 
three quarters of an hour, skim it well, pass it 
through a sieve, and it will be clear and ready 
for use for making soups. In case bacon or ham 
cannot be obtained, use half a pound more meat

and a little more salt. The meat not being over- 
stewed, will be found excellent eaten plain, or 
with parsley and butter, or any sauce. 

2. Proceed exactly as No. 1. Add two cloves 
and about two ounces of carrot, and the same 
of turnip, leeks, celery, or a quarter of a pound 
of one of them, if you cannot get the variety. 
To add more zest to the flavour, add the smallest 
quantity of thyme, winter savory, or a bay leaf. 
This is very important, as it gives you the key 
whereby you may vary the flavour of every 
kind of soup. 

NoTE.—This broth is of a nice white colour, and should 
it be required to look like sherry wine, add suflflcient 
colouring, (44), or half a burnt onion, when it is making. 

Brown Gravies. 

8. The following is very good for brown 
sauce, and also for every kind of roast 
meat, game, or poultry ; and a gill of it may be 
used to give a colour to any kind of broth, instead 
of colouring or burnt onions : 

Grease the bottom of the pot with about two 
ounces of fat, butter, or dripping; cut four onions 
in thick slices crossways, lay them on the bottom, 
and place over them three pounds of leg or shin 
of beef, or clod and sticking ; cut it slantway in 
pieces, chop the bone, then add two tea-spoonfuls 
of salt, half a spoonful of pepper ; set it on the 
Are until it begins to hiss, which indicates that 
all the moisture is dispersed ; reduce the heat of 
the fire by throwing ashes on the top ; put on

the pan with the cover over. Let the onions 
stew until quite brown, but not burnt, and the 
fat is as clear as oil, which you will easily per- 
ceive by holding the pan or pot on one side, the 
contents of which will be smoking hot, and stick 
to the bottom, though not burning; immediately 
add five pints of cold water; when boiling, skim 
and simmer one hour ; pass through the sieve, 
and put by till wanted. It will keep for many 
days in winter, and also in summer, by boiling 
it every other day, with the tiddition of half a 
gill of water added to it now and then. 

The remains of roast or boiled meat, game, 
poultry, (fee, may be added, cut up, and the 
bones broken, using only half the quantity of 
meat. The meat may be taken out and served 
separate, with a mustard or any sharp sauce. 

The addition of cloves (say four), a little mace, 
carrots, turnips, and celery, and a few sweet 
herbs, will vary the flavour of the gravy. 

J sharp Brown Sauce for boiled Fowls and Meat. 

4. Put a table-spoonful of chopped onions into 
a stew pan with one of Chili vinegar, one of 
common vinegar, one of colouring, three of water, 
two of mushroom ketchup, two of Harvey's sauce, 
one of anchovy, and a pint of melted butter, 
let it simmer until it becomes rather thick to 
adhere to the back of the spoon, add half a tea- 
spoonful of sugar. This is excellent to almost 
all kinds of broiled meats, and gives a nice relish 
to stews, fish, poultry, &c.

Clear Vegetable Soup. 

6. Cut in small dice, two-thirds of carrots and 
turnips, and one-third of onions, leeks, and celery, 
altogether about half a pound; wash them well, 
drain, put into pan or iron pot, two ounces of 
butter or dripping, and a tea-spoonful of sugar ; 
put on the fire, stir often ; when no moisture is 
to be seen add three pints of broth No. 1, simmer 
and skim, until the carrots are tender, and serve. 
If all the above vegetables cannot be obtained 
at the same time, use the same weight of either. 
Be careful thai vou remove the fat from all clear 
soup. All clea vegetable soup, when done, 
ou^ht to partake of a brownish colour. 

The addition of a few green peas, when in 
season, small pieces of broccoli, a cauliflower, 
or a few Brussels sprouts, previously boiled, 
makes an improvement in the above. A little 
chervil and tarragon render it both pleasant and 
refreshing. 

Clear Turnip Soup, 

6. Peel and cut in large dice half a pound of 
turnips, put in pan-with butter or fat, and a little 
sugar ; proceed as above, add the broth, simmer 
skim, and serve. Give it a nice brown colour. 
If turnips are either streaky or spongy, they will 

not do. 

Carrot Soup. 

7. For carrots proceed as above and simmer 
till tender ; they take twice as long as th« arti- 
chokes doing.

when nothing but the clear fat is seen in the pan 
and they are sufficiently done, add the broth. 
A few minutes will cook them. 

Vermicelli and MaccaronL 

9. Boil three pints of the broth No. 1, break 
into it a quarter of a pound of vermicelli or 
maccaroni ; boil till tender, and serve. Macaroni 
takes twice as long as vermicelli doing. 

Or, the maccaroni can be boiled separate, and 
kept in salt and water for some days, and used 
as required for soups and made dishes. 

Rice, 

10. Wash well two ounces of common Bengal 
rice ; boil it gently in three pints of broth ; when 
tender, serve. In case of illness, two ounces of 
tapioca or semolina may be used instead. 

White Soup with Meat. 

11. When the broth No. 1 is done, skim off the 
fat, put the meat in the tureen, then put into a 
basin two ounces of flour, mix gently with half 
a pint of milk, a half tea-spoonful of salt, and a 
quarter ditto of pepper ; add to the broth by 
degrees ; boil it ten minutes, and keep stirring ; 
skim and serve with the meat. Fried or toasted 
bread cut in dice may be added.

12. May be easily and cheaply made thus ; — 
(1) Purchase a calf's head ; if large, use half for 
a day's dinner ; cut the head open, take out the 
brains, put it in the pot with six tea-spoonfuls of 
salt, two of pepper, four onions, parsley, and a 
little thyme ; put in six quarts of water, in which 
mix one quarter of a pound of flour ; being 
placed, set it to boil gently, skim it occasionally, 
boil three hours ; just before serving, add a 
wineglass of vinegar ; serve with parsley and 
butter, alone, or with the brains, boiled and put 
in it; serve with sauce. No. 4. Take what may 
remain of (1), with the other half of head, and 
remove the bone ; cut the meat into pieces ; add 
it in proportion of one pound of meat to every 
four quarts of broth of No. 1; mix some flour 
and Ailk, as above, and add it to it, and half a 
tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper, and four cloves; 
let it simmer on the fire for one hour, tie up six 
sprigs of savory, same of thyme, which put into 
the soup, and remove when serving. The juice 
of half a lemon is an improvement, just before 
serving, as well as a drop of wine, if handy. If 
required brown, add three table-spoonfuls of 
colouring ; and use water or broth for thickening, 
instead of milk. The water in which the calf s 
head is boiled may be kept, and added to the 
stock. This soup will keep for a long time if 
boiled occasionally, and a little water added ; it 
should never be covered, or fermentation will

rice, cfec, previously boiled, can be used in the 
same way. 

Puree, or Thick Vegetable Soupa.— Green Pea, 

15. Put a quart of large green peas in the pot 
or pan, with two ounces of butter or fat, and the 
same of lean bacon cut small, a middling-sized 
onion, little mint, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, one 
of sugar, half the same of pepper, a gill of water ; 
set on a slow fire, stir now and then, or until no 
more moisture remains on the bottom of the pan ; 
add two or three table-spoonfuls of flour, stir

round quick, and break the peas against the side 
of the pan with a wooden spoon ; moisten with 
a quart of milk and a quart of water, simmer 
twenty minutes, or more if old peas, and serve. 

This, by leaving out the bacon, becomes Meagre 
Soup. Fried bread, in small dice, is a good 
accompaniment. 

If you have any broth (No. 1), use it instead 
of the milk and water. 

By passing the peas through a hair sieve, 
which is done by breaking and pressing them 
with the back of the spoon, an inviting pur^e is 
produced ; after which warm up, and serve. 



Pumpkin Soup, 

16. Is a very favourite dish in many parts of 
France, especially with the juveniles ; and when, 
in season, there is not a school, college, hospital, 
convent, or monastery, where it is not made ; a 
proof that it must be very wholesome. The 
Vegetable Marrow^ the American Butter Squash, 
and the Mammoth Gourd, are good substitutes. 

Cut about two pounds of the flesh of the 
pumpkin into large dice, put it into your pan, 
with three ounces of salt butter or fat ; add two 
tea-spoonfuls of salt, the same of sugar, a little 
pepper, and half a pint of water ; set on the fire, 
and stew gently for twenty minutes. When in 
pulp, add two table-spoonfuls of flour, stir round, 
Mid moiatan with three pints of either milk,

p^ This soup is on the list of meagre soups, 
and freely partaken by Catholics during Lent, 
the word meagre meaning, want of strength. 
But this soup, and many others in the same 
category, are well worthy the attention of the 
middle classes of this country, it being only 
meagre in name, and not in fact, as it possesses 
a large quantity of farinaceous matter ; bread 
being also served with it. 

Vegetable Marrow. 

17. Peel and take out the inside,if seeded,cut in 
slices about two pounds ; putin saucepan on the 
fire, with a quarter of a pound of butter or fat ; 
add two tea-spoonfuls of salt, one of sugar, and 
one quarter of the same of pepper, a gill of water, 
and one onion sliced ; stew gently until in pulp, 
then add two table-spoonfuls of flour, and pro- 
ceed as for pumpkin soup. 

Turnip Soup, 

18. Use two and a half pounds of good turnips, 
and proceed as above. 

New Spring and Autumn Soup. 

19. A most refreshing soup, when the markets 
are full of everything, and few use them, can be 
made as a honne-houche. Wash, dry, and cut 
up four cabbage lettuces, and one coss ditto, a

handful of sorrel, a little tarragon and chervil, 
and two or three small cucumbers peeled and 
sliced ; put into a saucepan a quarter of a pound 
of butter, then set in the vegetables ; put on a 
slow fire, and stir often, until there is no liquid 
remaining ; add two table-spoonfuls of flour, mix 
well, and moisten with two quarts of broth (No. 
1) or water, and set it to boil ; when boiling, 
add a pint of green peas, two tea-spoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, a little pepper and salt ; when 
the peas are tender, serve. If you use water, 
increase the quantity of seasoning. 

Red Carrot Soup. 

20. Scrape gently, and cut in very thin slices 
two pounds of carrots ; put them in the sauce- 
pan or pot, with two onions sliced, two ounces 
of ham cut small, two cloves, a little thyme, 
salt, pepper, sugar as above, half a pint of water,

MANUAL OF COOKERY, 

Various Meat Soups, 



28. OibleL-^Theae should be procured ready 
cleaned, but if not, they must be scalded ; when 
done, cut them into about twelve pieces, wash 
them well, and dry in a cloth ; put into a pan a 
quarter of a pound of butter or dripping, set it 
on the 6re, melt it, then add four ounces of flour 
stir continually until it begins to brown, add two 
ounces of lean bacon, and two onions or leeks 
sliced, fry a few minutes longer, put in the 
giblets, fry gently for ten minutes, stirring now 
and then, pour over two quarts of water, stir till 
boilmg, and set it to simmer; then add two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, half one of pepper, one of sugar 
three cloves, a little thyme, bay leaf, and about 
a quarter of a pound ot celery well washed and 
cut up small; continue simmering until the 
giblets are tender, remove the fat, and serve. A 
wineglass of sherry and a little cayenne may be 
added. A pound of beef or veal is, of course, a 
great mprovement. This receipt is for the giblets 
of a, middle-sized turkey. ^ 

Hare Soup, 

24. Take an old hare that is good for nothing 
else, cut It into pieces, and put to it a pound and 
a half of lean beef, two or three shank-bones of 
mutton well cleaned, a slice of lean bacon or 
hani an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs : pour

Itill the hare is stewed to pieces ; strain off the 
hiquor and give it one boil, with an anchovy out 
into pieces ; and add a spoonful of soy, a little 
I Cayenne, and salt. A few fine fc*'cemeat-balls, 
fried of a good brown, should be served in the 
Itureen. 

Ox -rump Soup, 

25. Two or three rumps of beef will make it 
stronger than a much larger quantity of meat 
without these ; and form a very nourishing soup. 

Ox Tail. 

26. Cut them at the joints, and proceed as for 
giblets, adding one pint more water for two 
small tails, and simmer half an hour longer, or 
till done. This should be of a brown colour. 
Vegetables cut into dice may be added. Serve 
when tender ; some will take double the time 
cooking, according to size. 

Ox Cheek. 

27. Boil half a large cheek for twenty minutes 
in two quarts of water, to set it ; take it out, 
cut it into thin slices, or small pieces, and then 
proceed exactly as for giblets. Serve when 
tender. 

N'ew Mutton Broth, 

28. Cut two pounds of the scrag, or any other 
lean part of mutton, in ten or twelve pieces.

30. Put into the iron pot two ounces of drip- 

ping, one quarter pound of bacon, cut into dice, 

two good onions sliced ; fry them gently until 

brownish, then add one large or two small 

turnips, the same of carrots, one leak, and one 

head of celery, all cut thin and slanting (if all 

these cannot be obtained, use any of them, but 

about the same amount); fry for ten minutes 

more and then add seven quarts of water ; boil 

up, and then add one pound and half of 'split 

peas ; simmer for two or three hours, until re- 

duced to a pulp, which depends on the quality

Scotch Mutton Broth. 



31. Soak a neck of mutton in water one hour; 
cut off the scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with 
two quarts of water. As soon as it boils skim 
it well, and then simmer it an hour and a half; 
then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into 
pieces (two bones in each),take some of the fat off 
and put as many as you think proper ; skim the 
moment the fresh meat boils up, and every 
quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four 
or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and 
three onions all cut but not small, and put them 
in soon enough to get quite tender ; add four 
large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wetted 
with cold water. The meat should stew three 
hours. ISalt to taste, and serve all together. — 
Twenty minutes before serving put in some 
chopped parsley. It is an excellent winter dish. 

Veal Broth.

quarts of water, two ounces of rice, and a little 
salt, and a blade of mace, till the liquor is half 
wasted away.

It may be seasoned, instead of cream, with two 
glasses of sherry or Madeira, a large spoonful 
of ketchup, and some Cayenne. When in the 
tureen, add salt. 

Partridge Soup. 

34. Take two old partridges ; skin them ; and 
cut them into pieces, with three or four slices of 
ham, a stick of celery, and three large onions 
cut into slices. Fry them all in butter till brown, 
but take care not to burn them. Then put them 
into a stew-pan, with five pints of boiling water, 
a few pepper-corns, a shank or two of mutton, 
and a little salt. Stew it gently two hours ; then

pounds of the lean of fresh beef, and a pound of 
bacon or pickled pork ; cut then^. into pieces and 
put ^ them into a large soup pot with the peas 
(which must first be well drained) and a table- 
spoonful of dried mint, rubbed to powder ; and 
five quarts of water, and boil the soup gently 
for three hours, skimming it well, and then put 
m four heads of celery cut small, or two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered celery-seed. It must be 
boiled until the peas are dissolved. Serve with 
toast. 

Green Pea iSoup, 

38. In shelling the peas, divide the old from 
the young; put the old ones, with an ounce of 
butter, a pint of water, the outside leaves of a 
lettuce or two, two onions, pepper, and salt, to 
stew till you can pulp the peas ; and when vou 
have done so, put to the liquor that stewed them 
some more water, the hearts and tend^^r stalks 
ot the lettuces, the young peas, a handful of 
spmach cut small, and salt and pepper to relish 
properly, and stew till quite soft. If the soup is 
too tfnn, or not rich enough, either of these 
faults may be removed by adding an ounce or 
two of butter, mixed with a spoonful of rice or 
wheat-flour, and boiled with it half an hour 
Before serving, boil some green mint shred fine

or ham-bone, <fec., may be boiled with the old 
peas, which is called the stock. More butter 
than is mentioned above may be used with ad- 
vantage, if the soup is required to be very rich. 

When peas first come in, or are very young, 
[the stock may be made of the shells washed, and 
boiled till they will pull with the above : more 
thickening will then be wanted, 

Onion Soup 

39. Into the water that has boiled a leg or 
neck of mutton, put carrots, turnips, and (if you 
have one) a shankbone, and simmer two hours. 
Strain it on six onions, first sliced and fried of a 
light brown, simmer three hours, skim it care- 
fully, and serve. Put into it a little roll, or fried 
breaJ. 

Gravy Soup. 

40. Wash and soak a leg of beef; break the 
bone,and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, 
a large bunch of sweet herbs, two large onions 
sliced and fried afine brown (but not burnt), two 
blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of 
allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew till the 
soup is as rich as you choose ; then take out the 
meat, which may be served with a little of the 
gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat ; 
which will serve for basting, or for common pie- 
crust. Have ready such vegetables as you choose 
to serve. Cut carrots, turnips, and celery, small, 
and simmer till tender : some people do not like

add to it a large spoonful of soy, and one of mush- 
room-ketchup. A French roll should be made 
hot, put into the soup till moist through, and 
served in the tureen. 

Scotch Leek Soup. 

41, Put the water that has boiled a leg of 
mutton into a stew-pot, with a quantity of 
chopped leeks, and pepper and salt; simmer 
them an hour : then mix some oatmeal with a 
little cold water quite smooth, pour it into the 
soup, set it on a slow part of the fire, and let it 
simmer gently ; but take care that it does not! 
burn to the bottom. 

Mock- Turtle Soup, 

42. Boil a large calfs head one hour, take the| 
bones out, put the meat to get cold, then cut it 
up in small pieces ; boil two shins of beef in the 
same liquor as the head was boiled in with the 
bones of the head. Add one head of celery, two 
carrots, two turnips, three onions, and six cloves, 
then boil six hours, strain through a sieve— take 
off all the fat. Put half a pound of butter into 
a stew pan, dry it up with flour, let it stand on

j1 Good Soup, 

43. Put into a stew-mug, a leg or neck of 
mutton, with carrots, turnips, and one or two 
onions, a bunch of parsley, m*\rjoram, and two 
or three quarts of water. Place the mug before 
the fire and let it remain there the whole day, 
turning it occasionally. The next day put the 
whole of it in a pan, and place it on a brisk fire. 
When it commences to boil, take the pan off the 
fire and put it on the hob to simmer until the 
meat is done. When ready for use, take out the 
meat, dish it up with carrotg and turnips, and 
send it to the table. Pass the soup through a 
sieve, skim off the fat, and put it on the fire, with 
a little powdered arrowroot to thicken it. When 
it is sufficiently thick, pour in a little sherry 
wine, and season to your taste. 

Colouring for Soups and Gravies, 

44. Put four ounces of lump sugar, a gill of 
water, and half an ounce of the finest butter 
into a small tosser, and set it over a gentle fire. 
Stir it with a wooden gpoon, till a bright brown.

Then add half pint of water ; boil, skirn, and when 
cold, bottle and cork it close. Add to soup or

Oyster Soup. 
45 Make a rich mutton broth, with two largel 
onions, Wee blades of mace, and black pepper. 
When strained pour it on a hundred and titty 
oysters, without the beards, and a bit of butter 
rolled in flour. Simmer gently a quarter of an| 
hour, and serve. 

Rich Oyster Soup. 
46. Take a small can of oysters, wash them 
clean in their liquor and put them in a stew-pan, | 
then strain the liquor into them free from grit, 
add as much milk as you require soup, simmer 
a quarter of an hour, but not boil ; add an ounce! 
of butter well mixed with flour, nutmeg.Cayenne 
pepper, and salt to palate, a few drops of essence 
of lemon ; break into the whole half a dozen 
crackers and serve up. 

Beef Broth, or French Pot-au-feu. 

46. It consists in a decoction of beef, leg of 
veal, an old hen, carrots, turnips, leeks, celery, 
cloves stuck in a burnt onion, water and salt. 
This broth must be done gently for three hours, 
80 that the water dissolves the mucous parts 
of the meat, and easily separates from the scum. 
It can be prepared in a 6atn-marw, and in this 
manner is more delicate. 



BROTHS. 



S5 



Brotli of Beef^ Mutton and Veal 
46 Put two pounds of lean beef, one pound 
of scrag of veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, 
9,veet herbs, and ten peppercorns, into a sauce- 
nan with five quarts of water ; simmer to three 
Quarts, and clear off the fat when cold. Add 
one onion, if approved. ' 

Soup or broth made of different meats is more 
supporting, as well as better flavored. 

To remove the fat, take off the broth, vn<\ 
when it is cold, if there be any still remaining 
lav a bit of clean blotting-paper on the broth 
when in the basin and it will take up every par- 
tide Or if the broth is wanted before there is 
time to let it get cold, put a piece of cork up the 
narrow end of a funnel, pour the brotAi into it, let 
it stand for a few minutes, and the fat will rise 
to the top ; remove the cork , and draw off into a 
basin as much of the broth as is wanted, which 
will be perfectly free from fat. 

Chicken Broth. 
47 May be made of any young fowl which is 
afterwards to be brought to the table^; but the 
best sort is to be procured from an old cock or 
hen, which is to be stewed down to rags wit,h a 
couple of onions, seasoned with salt and a little 
whole pepper ; skim and strain it. 

Eel Broth. 
48. Clean half a pound of small eels, and set 






36 



MANUAL OF COOKBRy. 





on with three pints of water, some parsley, one 
slice of onion, and a few peppercorns ; let them 
simmer till the eels are broken, and the broth 
good, or reduced to a pint and a half. Add salt, 
and strain it oflf. It is very nutritious. 

Beef Tea, 

49. Cut one pound of fleshy beef in thin slices ; 
simmer with a quart of water an hour and a half I 
after it has once boiled and been skimmed. Sea-| 
son, if approved; but it wants generally only a 
little salt. 

60. Another, (very grateful in convalescence 
when there is a tendency to diarrhoea). Put into 
a preserving jar alternate layers of beef, cut into 
small pieces, and sliced turnips ; when the jar 
is filled, place it into a water bath or slow oven, 
and let it remain for two or three hours ; then 
drain off all the tea, using a little pressure to as- 
sist the operation, and let it stand till cold, when 
any fat may be taken off, if wanted directly, it 
may be removed while hot with silver paper. 

Teakettle Broth. 

51. Cut some small squares of crumb of bread 
into a broth basin, and some finely-chopped pars- 
ley, with enough of salt to flavour it ; pour over 
it some boiling water, softening the whole with 
a spoonful or two of cream or milk. Some in- 
valids like the flavour of mint, and peas when in 
season; and if this can be allowed by the medi.

cal man, the water used must have a few youBg 
peas, or pea-pods, and a leaf of mint boiled in it, 
before pouring it over the bread ; without this 
addition, it is often much liked by invalids, ai 
being so free from grease, and so clean-tasting. 
A little clear gravy may sometimes be added 
with advantage. Season to palate. 

Broth for Invalids, 
52. Take six pounds of shin of beef, six pounds 
of any white meat, seasoned, and an onion, if 
liked; put it in a stone jar, and tie down with 
bladder ; let it boil twelve hours in a large sauce- 
pan of water, then strain it off. A tea or table- 
Bpoonful is enough for an invalid, if taken se- 
veral times during the day. What remains after 
the soup has been strained makes excellent com- 
mon stock with additional water. 

Directions for Gravies, 

63. Gravy may be made quite as good of the 
skirt of beef, and the kidney, as of any other 
meat, if prepared in the same way. ; - r- 

An ox-kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut 
all to pieces, and prepared as other meat ; and so 
will the shank end of mutton that has been 
dressed. 

The shank-bones of mutton are a great im- 
provement to the richness of gravy ; but first 
soak them well, and scour them clean. 

Tarragon giv^es the flavour of French cookery.

and in high gravies is a great improvement ; but 
it should be added only a short time before 

serving. 

Clear Gravy. 

64. Slice beef thin; broil a part of it over a 
very clear quick fire, just enough to give colour 
to the gravy, but not to dress it: put that and 
the raw into a very nicely tinned stew-pan, with 
two onions, a clove or two. whole black peppers, 
berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet herbs: 
cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and 
skim it well two or three times ; then cover it, 
and simmer till quite strong.

Oni of our greatest modern cooks (Soyer) places his 
Stock, for Sauces, principally in butter. Now, butter, with 
all due respect to Mons. Soyer's opinion, is not the impor- 
tant essential preparation which cooks in general use in 
culinary operations, in this country. We prefer using 
the gravies of meats, which, with the addition of onion, 
parsley, or any other kitchen herb, tinctures the gravy 
or sauce according to the palate. Nevertheless, we here 
give a variety of sauci s as prepared by Soyer, and other 
eminent cooks. The majority of them are composed of 
ingredients, some of which are not always availabjle in this 
country, it is true, but the other portions of their consti- 
tuent parts will not only be found useful, but accessible, 
by every family. 

Melted Butter, 

1. Take two ounces, of butter, and two ounces 
of flour, half a tea-spoonful of salt, a quarter that 
of pepper, mixed together with a spoon, put into 
a quart pan, with a pint of cold water ; place it 
on the fire, and stir continually, take it out when 
it begins to simmer, then add one more ounce of 
butter, stir till melted, and it is ready for use, or 
as the foundation of the following sauces : — 

2. Another. — One ounce of butter, one and a 
half of flour, a little more salt, pepper, and a gill 
more water ; simmer, and serve. 

Melted butters may be improved by adding 
half a table-spoonful of vinegar.

Celery Sauce,— Boil in a half-pint of white 
gravy, if handy, if not, water, one fine head of 
celery, cut in one inch lengths and well washed,

Cucumber Sauce. — Cut up two cucumbers 
lengthways, remove the seeds, cut them in one 
inch pieces, boil them in a gill of white gravy, 
with salt and pepper, add it to the melted butter ;

3. Put a quarter of a pound of butter and eight 
ounces of flour in a saucepan, and set it on a slow 
fire ; keep stirring for ten minutes, or till light 
brown, then take it off and let it get nearly cold, 
then pour over sufficient brown stock, No. 3, to 
make it a nice thickness, or like thinnish melted 
butter; then boil for half an hour, skim, strain 
it into a basin, and use where and ^hen required. 
If you have this sauce by you, use it instead of 
melted butter for brown sauces. To make it

White Sauce for Fricassee of Fowls, Rabbits^ 
White Meat, Fish or Vegetables. 

6. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this 
favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour 
is but small. The water that has boiled fowls, 
veal, or rabbit ; or a little broth, that inay be in 
the house ; or the feet and necks of chicken, or 
raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew with a 
little water any of these, with a bit of lemon-peel, 
some sliced onion, some white pepper-corns, a

little poliflded mace, or nutmeg, and a bunch of 
sweet herbs, until the flavour be good, then 
strain it, and add a little good cream, a piece of 
butter, and a little flour : salt to your taste. A 
squeeze of lemon may be added after the sauce 
is taken off the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of 
egg is often used in fricassee, but if you have 
any cream it is better ; and the former is apt to- 
curdle. 

Sauce for Wild Fowl, 

7. Simmer a tea-cupful of port wine, the same 
quantity of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a. 
little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit 
of mace, for ten minutes; put in a bit of butter, 
and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through 
the birds. In general they are not stuffed as 
tame, but may be done so if liked. 

Another for the same, or for Ducks, 

8. Serve a rich gravy in the dish ; cut the 
breast into slices, but don't take them off; cut 
a lemon, and put pepper and salt on it ; then 
squeeze it on the breast, and pour a spoonful of 
gravy over before you help. 

Sauce for cold Fowl, or Partridge, 

9. Rub down the yolks of two eggs, boiled 
hard, an anchovy, two dessert-spoonfuls of oil^ 
three of vinegar, a shalot, cayenne if approved, 
and a tea-spoonful of mustard. All should be 
pounded before the oil is added. Then strain it. 
Shalot-vinegar instead of shalot, eats well.

and as much butter, mixed with a little milk, as 
will make sauce enough ; but first rub a little 
flour with it. Set them over the fire, and stir 
all the time: and when the butter has boiled 
once or twice, take theme ff, and keep the sauce- 
pan near the fire, but not on it: for if done too 
much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze alittle 
lemon-juice, and serve. Alittle cream is a great 
improvement. Observe , the oysters will thin 
the sauce, so put butter accordingly. '' J -f

Forcemeat, 

63. Whether in the form of stuffing-balls, or 
for patties, makes a considerable part of good 
cooking, by the flavour it imparts to whatsoever 
dish it is added, if properlj^ made. Exact rules 
for the quantity cannot easily be given ; but the 
following observations may be useful, and habit 
will soon give knowledge in mixing it to the 
taste. At many tables, where every thing else is 
well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing 
According to what it is wanted for, should be 
the selection from the following list, observing 
that of the most pungent articles, least must be 
used JSTo one flavour should predominate 
greatly ; yet, if several dishes be served the same 
day, there should be a marked variety in the 
taste of the forcemeat, as well as of the gravies 
It should be consistent enough to cut with a 
knife, but not dry and heavy.

Forcemeat, to force Fowls or Meat, 

64. Shred a little ham, or gammon, some cold 
veal, or fowl, some beef suet ; a small quantity of 
onion, some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, 
nutmeg, or pounded mace, and either white 
pepper, or Cayenne, and bread crumbs. 

Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with one or 
two eggs beaten and strained. For forcemeat 
patties, the mixture as above. 

Browning for Sauces, 

65. Put half a pound of brown sugar into an 
iron saucepan, and melt it over a modera-te fire 
for about twenty-five jninutes, stirring it con- 
tinually, until quite black, but it must become so 
by degrees, or too sudden a heat will make it 
bitter, then add two quarts of water, and in ten 
minutes the sugar will be dissolved. Bottle 
for use. 

Sauce for roasting Pig, 

66. Chop the brains a little, put in a tea-spoon- 
ful of white gravy, that runs from the pig, and 
a small piece of anchovy. Mix them with about 
half a pound of butter, and as much flour as will 
thicken the gravy, a slice of lemon, a spoonful 
of white wine, some caper-liquor and a little 
salt. Shake it over the fire, and pour it into 
the dish. 

Or broil a few currants, and send them up, 
with a glass of currant jelly in the middle.

OBSEEVATI0N8 ON THE MODE OP PURCHASING, PRE- 
SERVING AND DRESSING FISH. 

Persons in purchasing fish, should first ascertain 

«;!i »n^ -f, '■ *H'?'?''yl'« i°^^ by examining the 
eyes and gills, which, as a general rule, if fresh 
Jill be bright and red; if stale, the eve will b«

Care should be taken to clean the fish verv 
mcelym hard water, (without too much waS 
to soften It.) By placing fish into salt and wate? 
for one hour before boiling, it will become fin 
and eat more solid, " "'ui

over the kettle, to keep hot for serving; and a 
clean cloth over the fish to prevent it losing its 
colour. 

Small fish nicely fried, covered with egg and 
crumbs, make a dish far more elegant than if ser- 
ved plain. — Great attention should be paid to 
garnishing fish: use plenty of horse-radish, pars- 
ley, and xemon. 

When well done, and with a very good sauce, 
fish is more attended to than any other dish. 
The liver and roe should be placed on the dish, 
so that the lady may see them, and help a part 
to every one. 

If fish is to be fried or broiled, it must be wrapt 
in a nice soft cloth after it is well cleansed and 
washed — When perfectly dry, wet with an egg 
if for frying, and sprinkle the finest crumbs of 
bread over it; if done a second time with the 
egg and bread, the fish will look much better; 
then have a thick-bottomed frying-pan on the 
fire, with a large quantity of lard or dripping 
boiling-hot, plunge the fish into it, and let it fry 
middling quick, till the colour is a fine brown 
yellow, and it is judged ready. 

The same dripping, with a little fresh, will 
serve a second time. Butter gives a bad colour, 
oil fries of the finest colour for those who will 
allow the expense. 

Garnish with a fringe of curled raw parsley, 
or parsley fried, which must be thus done : When 
washed and picked, t^ "ow it again into

clean water; when the lard or dripping boils, 
throw the parsley into it immediately from the 
water, and instantly it will be green and crisp 
and must be taken up with a slice: this may be 
done after the fish is fried. 

If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned 
floured, and put on a gridiron that is very clean ■ 
which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of 
suet to prevent the fish from sticking. It must 
be broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not 
taste smoky ; and not too near, that it may be 
scorched. '' 

Strong Fish Gh-avy. 
1. Skin two or three eels, gut and wash them 
very clean ; cut them into small nieces, and put 
into a saucepan. Cover them with water, and 
add a little crust of bread toasted brown two 
blades of mace, some whole pepper, sweet herbs 
a piece of lemon-po.], an anchovy or two, and a 
tea-spoonful or two of horseradish. Cover close 
and simmer; add a bit of butter and flour, and 
boil with the above.

8. The fish-kettle must be of a proper size, 
and in the nicest order. Set the fish in cold 
water sufficient to cover it completely, throw a 
handful of salt and a glass of vinegar into it, and 
let it gradually boil: but skim it well, and 
preserve the beauty of the colour. 

Serve it garnished with a complete fringe of 
curled parsley, lemon, and horse radish. 

The sauce must be the finest lobster, and 
anchovy butter, and plain butter, served plenti- 
fully in separate tureens. 

To boil Salmon. 

4. Clean it carefully, boil it gently and take 
it out of the water as soon as done. Let the 
water be warm if the fish be split. If underdone 
it is very unwholesome. Serve with shrimp or 

anchovy-sauce. 

To broil Salmon. 

6. Cut slices an inch thick, and season with 
pepper and salt; lay each slice in half a sheet of 
white paper well buttered, twist the ends of the 
paper, and broil the slices over a slow fire six or 
eight minutes. Serve in the paper with anchovy 

sauce. 

To pot Salmon, 

6. Take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do 
not wash it ; salt very well, let it lie till the salt 
is melted and drained from it, then season with 
beaten mace, cloves, and whole pepper : lay in a

drain it from the gravy, put it into the pots to 
keep, and when cold cover it with clarified butter. 
In this manner you may do any firm fish. 

An excellent dish of dried Salmon. 
1. Pull some into flakes; have ready some 
eggs boiled hard, and chopped large ; put both 
into half a pint of thin cream, and two or three 
ounces of butter rubbed with a tea-spoonful of 
flour; skim it and stir till boiling hot; make a

Cod. 

10. Some people boil the cod whole ; but a 
large head and shoulders contain all the fish that 
is proper to help, the thinner parts being over- 
done and tasteless, before the thick are cooked ; 
the lower half, if sprinkled and hungup, will be 
in high perfection one or two days ; or it maybe 
made Salter, and served with egg-sauce, potatoes, 
and parsnips. Cod, if boiled quite fresh is watery ; 
but eats excellently if salted and hung up for a 
day to give it firmness, then stuffed and broiled, 
or boiled. 

Cod^s Head and Shoulders^ 

11. Will eat much finer by having a little salt 
rubbed down the bone, and along the thick part, 
even if to be eaten the same day. 

Tie it up, and put it on the fire in cold water 
which will completely cover it ; throw a handful 
of salt into it. Garnish with a large quantity of 
double parsley, lemon, horse-radish, and the milt, 
roe, and liver. 

Serve with Fish-sauce, No. 33, oyster or shrimp- 
sauce, and anchovy and butter. 

Cod Sounds boiled. 

12. Soak them in warm water half an hour, 
then scrape and clean ; if to be dressed white, 
boil them in milk and water ; when tender serve 
them in a napkin with egg-sauce. The salt must 
not be much soaked out, unless for fricassee.

Spitchcock Eels. 

39. Take one or two large eels, leave the skin 
on, cut them into pieces of three inches long, open 
them on the belly side, and clean them nicel}^ ; 
wipe them drj^, and then wet them with beaten 
egg, and strew chopped parsley over both sides, 
pepper, salt, a very little sage, and a bit of mace 
pounded fine and mixed with the seasoning. Rub 
the gridiron with a bit of suet, and broil the 
fish of a fine colour. 

Serve with anchovy sauce. No. 56, 

Fried Eels. 

40. If small, they should be curled round and 
fried, being first dipped into egg and crumbs of 
bread. 

Boiled Eels. 

41. The small ones are best : do them in a 
small quantity of water, with a good deal of 
parsley, which should be served up with them 
and the liquor. Serve, chopped parsley and 
butter for sauce.

over them to soak halfanhour ; <irain them dry, 
and make just hot through before the fire, then 
rub some cold butter over them and serve. Egg- 
sauce, or buttered eggs and mashed potatoes, 
should be sent up with them. 

Baked Herrings or Sprats: 
48 Wash and drain without wiping them; 
season with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a 
few whole cloves ; lay them in a pan with plenty 
of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay-leaves. 
Add half vinegar and half small beer, enough to 
cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake 
in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over 
them the night before, to make them look red. 
Gut, but do not open them. 

Sprats, 

49. Wipe the sprats gently with a cloth and 
put them in your frying-pan, which requires to 
be very clean, and hot through ; sprinkle in it 
about half a tea-spoonful of salt to every dozen 
of middle-size fish, which place immediately m 
the pan: leave them for two minutes, turn 
carefully with the blade of a knife, leave them 
three or four minutes longer, and serve very hot. 

50. Another.—Dip each sprat in flour, put in 
the pan a little fat, or oil ; when very hot, put 
in the fish, which semi-fry as above. They may 
also be lightly covered with egg and bread 
crumbs— or use sifted biscuit crumbs, which is a 
very agreeable variety of dressing them.

51 To Broil— Take a skewer long enough to 
holda dozen sprats; dip them lightly in flour ; 
nut the gridiron on as clear afire as possible, and 
when hot lay them on for two minutes ; turn 
them carefully, leave them till done, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and serve with toast or 
made into sandwiches. 

LobsUrs and Shrimps. 

62. To pot ioftsem.— Half boil them, pick out 
the meat, cut it into small bits, season with mace, 
white pepper, nutmeg, and salt press close into 
a pot and cover with butter, bake half an hour , 
pu^t he spawn in. When cold take the lobster 
out, and put it into the pots with a little of the 
butter. Beat the other butter in a mortar with 
some of the spawn; then mix that coloured 
butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover 
the pots, and strain it. Cayenne may be added 
if approved. Potted lobster may be used cold, or 
fls a fricassee, with a cream-sauce: it then ooks 
very nice, and eats excellently, especially if there 

'* Ma7kerei, Herrings, and Trout, are good potted 
as above. 

Stewed Lobster, a very high relish. 
53. Pick the lobster, put the berries into a dish 
that has a lamp, and rub them down with a bit 
of butter, two spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, one 
of soy, or walnut ketchup, a li"le salt and 
Cayenne, and a spoonful of port ; stew the lobster 
cut into bits with the gravy as above.

little white gravy and cream. 

Currie of Lobsters, 

55. Take them from the shells, and lay into a 
pan, with a small piece of mace, three or four 
spoonfuls of veal-gravy, and four of cream : rub 
smooth one or two tea-spoonfuls of currie powder, 
a tea-spoonful of flour, and an ounce of butter: 
simmer an hour; squeeze half a lemon in, and 
add salt. 

Prawns and Cray-fish in jelly, a beautiful dish,

into the bottom of a deep small dish : when cold, 
lay the cray-fish with their back downwards, 
and pour more jelly over them. Turn out when 
cold. 

To butter Prawns or Shrimps. 

57. Take them out of the shells; and warm 
them with a little good gravy, a bit of butter and 
flour, a scrape of nutmeg, salt, and pepper;

very little mace and cloves. Press them into a 
pot, set it in the oven ten minutes, and when 

cold put butter. 

Hot Crab. 

59. Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell 
from the head, then put the meat with a little 
nutmeg, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, crumbs of 
bread, and three spoonfuls of vinegar, into the 
shell again, and set it before the fire. You may 
brown it with a salamander. 

Dry toast should be served to eat upon. 

Dressed Crab cold, 

60. Empty the shells, and mix the flesh with 
oil, vinegar, salt, and a little white pepper, or 
Cayenne : then put the mixture into the large 
shell, and serve. Very little oil is necessary. 

Oysters, 

61. To feed Oysters.— Put them into water, and 
wash them with a broom till quite clean ; then 
lay them bottom-do wnwar is into a pan, sprinkle 
with flour or oatmeal and salt, and cover with 
water. Do the same every dt /, and they will 
fatten. The water should be pretty salt. 

To stew Oysters. 

62. Open and separate the liquor from them, 
then wash them from the grit , strain the liquor, 
and put with the oysters a bit of mace and 
lemon-peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer 
them very gently, and put some cream, and a 
little flour and butter.

Boiled Oysters. 

63. Let the shells be nicely cleaned first and 
serve in them, to eat with cold butter. 

To scallop Oysters. 

64. Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, 
salt, nutmeg, and a bit of butter, into saucers, and 
and bake before the fire, or in an oven. 

Fried Oysters, to garnish boiled Fish. 

66. Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, 
season it a very little, dip the oysters into it, 
and fry them a fine yellow-brown. A little 
nutmeg should be put into the seasoning, and a 
few crumbs of bread into the flour. ^ 

Oyster Patties, 
66. See Patties. 

To pickle Oysters, 

Ql, Open the number you intend to pickle, put 
them into a saucepan with their own liquor for 
ten minutes, simmer them very gently ; then put 
them into a jar, free from grit, and cover them 
when cold with the pickle thus made. Boil the 
liquor with ab't of mace, lemon-peel, and black 
peppers, and to every hundred put two spoon- 
fuls of the best vinegar. 

They should be kept in small jars, and tied 
close with bladder, for the air will spoil them. 

Note.— jPbr making Fish Pies will be found 
under the head Pies.

Another way to pickle Oysters, 

68. Wash four dozen of the largest oysters you 
can get in their own liquor, wipe them dry, strain 
the liquor off, adding to it a dessert-spoonful of 
pe|>per, two blades of mace, a table-spoonful of 
salt, if the liquor be not very salt, three of white 
wine, and four of vinegar. — Simmer the oysters 
a few minutes in the liquor, then put them in 
small jars and boil the pickle up, skim it, and 
when cold, pour over the oysters : cover close. 

New way of boiling Fish, 

69. The addition of a few herbs and vegetables 
in the water gives a very nice flavour to the fish. 
Add, according to taste, a little sliced onion, 
thyme, bay-leaf, winter savoury, carrots, celery, 
clove, mace, using whichever of these ingredients 
you can procure ; it greatly improves skate, 
fresh haddocks, gurnet, <fec. Fresh-water fish, 
which have no particular flavour, are preferable 
done thus, with the addition of a little vinegar. 
Choose whatever sauces you please for any of 
the above fish, from the series at No. 2. 

Salt Fish, Cod^ Ling, and Cod-Sounds. 

70. Soak two pounds of salt fish for six hours, 
if not previously soaked, or according to the 
cure ; put them in boiling water, in which some 
parsnips have been previously boiled. Twenty 
minutes, if the fish is thick, will be suflicient ; 
and serve with egg-sauce No. 42. Proceed the 
same with cod-sounds.

Tench and Perch, 

71. Tench and perch must be well scaled 
and cleaned, and put into the pan with a pint 
of water and a tea-spoonful of salt, one onion 
sliced, three sprigs of thyme, bay-leaf, pepper, 
parsley, celery, all in proportion ; a wine-glass 
of vinegar. If they weigh one pound boil for 
half an hour, according to size. Serve with any 
fish-sauce. Eels, Carp, and Pike, may be done 
as above, with a little scraped horse-radish, and 
served with parsley and butter. 

Cod Liver Stuffing. 

'72. Half a pound of raw chopped liver, three 
quarters of a pound of bread crumb or biscuit 
powder, salt, pepper and parsley; mix with two 
whole eggs. Use as stuffing for any kind of fish. 

Fricassee of Frogs, 

73. Kill and strip the skin off the hind legs of 
twenty-four frogs, which wash well, dry, roll in 
flour, fry in butter or beef dripping. Serve up 
with dry toast, or bread and butter In this way 
they are very delicious and tender eating. 

To Stew Frogs. 

74 Prepare your frogs as in above receipt, 
steeped in salt and water for half-an-hou?, dry 
and roll them in flour, and brown them in fry- 
pan, put them in gravy, No. 63, and stew one 
hour, with herbs and seasoning to palate, a little 
brown sauce No. 8, and ketchup. Garnish with 
lemon, or to fancy.

MEATS. 
VENISON, BEEF, VEAL, PORK, MUTTON AND LAMB. 

[Preliminary to the introduction of the articles contained 
in the above heading, the subjoine i observations on meats 
in general will be found well worthy of study, and the 
prudent housewife will find ample satisfaction in the re- 
sult, by seeing that the rules laid down are strictly (where 
practicable) observed. As the taste, or choice, of indivi- 
duals in particular joints, and their mode of cooking, vary 
very much, great varieties in the different modes of dress- 
ing are extensively given. Some valuable hints, also, with 
regard to market purchases and the keeping and dressing 
of meat, will be found interspersed throughout the obser- 
vations.] 

I 

In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the 
bone should be taken out, afi it is apt to taint ; as 
also the kernels of beef. 

The shank bones of mutton should be saved, 
and after soaking and brushing, may be added to 
give richness to gravies or soups. They are par- 
ticularly nourishing for sick persons. 

When sirloins of beef, loins of veal or mutton, 
come home, part of the suet may be cut off for 
puddings, or to clarify. 

Dripping will baste every thing as well as 
butter, except fowls and game. 

The fat from off a neck or loii of mutton, 
makes a much more lighter pudding than suet.

MANUAL or COOKERY, 




■ 




Meat and vegetables that have been frozen, 
should be soaked in cold water till thawed,' 
before using. Putting them into hot water, or 
to the fire, with the idea of expediting the expul- 
sion of the frost, makes il impossible for any 
heat to dress them properly afterwards. 

In warm weather, where meat has been touch- 
ed by flies, the part should be cut off, and after- 
wards well washed. 

In the height of summer, it is a very safe way 
to let meat that is to be salted, lie an hour in cold 
water, rubbing well any part likely to have been 
fly-blown; then wipe it quite dry, and rub the 
salt thoroughly into every part, throwing a hand- 
ful 07er it besides. Turn it every day, a^id rub 
the pickle in, which will make it ready for the 
table in three or four days. If requi, d to 
be extra corned wrap it in a well-floured cloth 
after rubbing it with salt. This last method will 
corn fresh beef fit for the table the same day it 
is purchased ; but it must be put into the pot 
when the water boils. 

If the weather permit, meat eats much better 
for hanging two or three days before it is salted. 

The water in which meat has been boiled 
makes an excellent soup, by adding vegetables, 
oatmeal, or peas. 

Wash all meat before you dress it, if for boiling, 
the color will be better for soaking, but if for 
roasting, dry it. 

Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat 
white.

Roast-beef bones, or shank of ham, make excel- 
lent pea-soup ; and should be boiled with the 
peas the day before eaten, that the fat may be 
taken off. 

Parlicular care must be taken that the pot is 
well skimmed the momenta boils, otherwise the 
foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The 
more soups or broths are skimmed, the better and 
cleaner they will be. 

Vegetables should not be dressed with the 
meat, except carrots or parsnips with boiled 
beef. 

In roasting meat, a very good way is to put a 
little salt and water into the dripping pan, and 
baste for a little while with this before using its 
own fat or dripping, when dry, dust it with flour, 
and baste as usual. 

Salting meat before it is put to roast draws 
out the gravy ; it should only be sprinkled when 
almost done. 

Old meats do not require so much dressing as 
young, not that they are sooner done, but they 
cm be eaten with the gravy more in. 

When you wish to have fried things look as 
well as possible, do them twice over with egg 
aid crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to 
giate quite fine will not look well. The fat you 
fry in must always be boiling hot the moment 
the fish, meat, <fec., are put in, and kept so till 
fiiished. A small quantity never fries well. 

To keep meat hot it is best to take it up when 
done, and, if not immediately wanted, set the

dish over a pan of boiling water, putting a deep 
cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and 
then throw a cloth over that. This way will not 
dry up the gravy. 

Meat boiled quick will be hard ; but care 
must be taken that in boiling slow it does not 
stop, or the meat will be underdone. 

The boiler and utensils should be kept scru- 
pulously clean. 

The length of time required for roasting and 
boiling depends upon the size of the joint, and 
the strength of the fire. In roasting solid pieces 
it is usually conceded that for each pound from 
twenty to twenty-five minutes should be allowed 

Beef of ten pounds weight will take rather 
better than two hours and a half to roast ; twenty 
pounds will take three hours and three quarters. 

A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half. 

A chine of pork two hours. 

A leg of pork or of lamb takes twenty minutes 
to a pound. 

A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours 
and a half, and others in proportion. 

A dried tongue, after being well soaked, will 
take four hours slow boiling ; a tongue out of 
pickle, from two and a half to three hours, or 
longer, if very large. 

Venison^ to keep,

pounded ginger over every part, which is a good 
preventative against the fly. By thus managing 
and watching, it will hang a fortnight. When 
to be used, wash it with a little luke-warm water, 
and dry it. Pepper is likewise good to keep it. 

To dress Venison. 

2. A haunch of buck will take three hours and 
a half or three quarters roasting ; doe, only three 
hours and a quarter. Venison should be rather 
over than under-done. 

Spread butter over a sheet of white paper, and 
put it over the fat, first sprinkling it with a little 
salt ; then lay a coarse paste on strong paper, 
and cover the haunch ; tie it with fine pack- 
thread, and set it at a distance from the fire, 
which must be a good one. Baste it often ; ten 
minutes before serving take off the paste, draw 
the meat nearer the fire, and baste it with butter 
and a good deal of flour to make il froth up well. 

Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not 
into the dish (unless there is none in the venison), 
and made thus : Cut off the fat from two or three 
pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks 
on a gridiron for a few minutes just to brown one 
side ; put them into a saucepan with a quart of 
water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer 
it gently ; then uncover it, and stew till the 
gravy is reduced to a pint. Season with only 
salt. Currant-jelly must be served in a boat. 

Formerly pap-sauce was eaten with venison ; 
which, as some still like it, it may be necessary

to direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with 
port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon ; 
and when quite smooth take out the cinnamon 
and add sugar. Olaret may be used for it. 

Make the jelly-sauce thus. Beat some currant- 
jelly and a spoonful or two of port wine, and set 
it over the fire till melted. Where jelly runs 
short put more wine, and a few lumps of sugar, 
to the jelly, and melt as above Serve with 
French beans. 

Haunch, Neck, and Shoulder of Venison, 

3. Roast with paste as directed above, and the 
same sauce. 

To stew a Shoulder of Venison, 

4. Let the meat hang till you think it fit to 
dress, then take out the bone, beat the meat with 
a rolling-pin, lay some slices of mutton-fat, that 
have lain a few hours in a little port wino, 
among it, sprinkle a little pepper and allspice 
over in fine powder, roll it up tight, and tie it. 
Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it, 
with some mutton or beef gravy not strong, half 
a pint of port wine ; some pepper and allspice. 
Simmer it close covered, as slow as you can, for 
three or four hours. When quite tender, take 
off the tape, and set the meat in a dish ; strain 
the gravy over it; serve with currant-jelly 
sauce — This is the best way to dress this joint, 
unless it is very fat, and then it should be roasted. 
Tlie bone should be stewed with it.

Breast of Venison,

Hashed Venison,

some without seasoning, as before; and only 
warmed through, not boiled. If there is no fat 
left, cut some slices of mutton-fat, set it on the

till dry, then put to the hash, and it will eat 
as well as the fat of the venison.— i^or Venison 
Pasty look under the head Pastry ; as likewise an 
excellent imitation. 

Beef, to keep. 

7. Take out the kernels in the neck-pieces 
where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from 
each round of beef ; one in the middle, which is 
called the pope's eye ; the other from the flap ; 
there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle 
of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially 
in summer, salt will be of no use for keeping the 
meat sweet. There is another kernel between 
the rump and the edge-bone. 

As butchers seldom attend to this matter, the 
cook should take out the kernels ; then rub the 
salt well into the beef intended for boiling, and 
slightly sprinkle that which is for roasting. 

The flesh of cattle that are killed when not 
perfectly cleared of food, soon spoils. They 
should fast twenty-four hours in winter, and 
double that time in summer, before being killed.

MANUAL OF OOOKSRT. 



To salt Beef or Pork for eating immediately. 
8. The piece should not weigh more than ^\q 
or six pounds. Salt it very thoroughly just 
before you put it into the pot; take a coarse 
cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it 
up close. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and 
boil it as long as you would any other salt beef 
of the same size, and it will be as salt as if done 
four or ^YQ days. 

Great attention is requisite in salting meat ; 
and in the country, where large quantities are 
cured, this is of particular importance. Beef and 
pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours 
afterwards hung to drain, before it is rubbed 
with salt ; which method, by cleansing the meat 
from the blood, serves to keep it from tasting 
strong. It should be turned every day ; and if 
wanted soon, should be rubbed as often. A 
salting-tub or lead may be used, and a cover to 
fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt meat 
will find it answer, well to boil up the pickle, 
skim it, and when cold, pour it over meat that 
has been sprinkled and drained. 

To salt beef red; which is extremely good to eat 
fresh from the Pickle, or to hang to dry, 
9. Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as 
you can (the flank is most proper), sprinkle it and 
let it drain a day ; then rub it with common salt, 
saltpetre, and bay-salt, but only a small propor- 
tion of the saltpetre, and you may add a few 
grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the

pickle every day into the meat for a week, then 
only turn it. It will be excellent in eight days. 
In sixteen drain it from the pickle. A little of 
the coarsest sugar may be added to the salt. It 
eats well, boiled tender with greens or carrots. 

The Dutch way to salt Beef, 

10. Take a lean piece of beef ; rub it well with 
brown sugar, and let it be turned often. In three 
days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and 
saltpetre beaten fine ; rub these well in, and 
turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight 
in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large 
weight ; hang it to dry in a wood-smoke, but 
turn it upside down every day. Boil it in spring- 
water, and press it ; it will grate, or cut into 
shivers, like Dutch beef. 

Beef a-la-mode. 

11. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer 
or ox. Cut into long slices some fat bacon, (][uite 
free from yellow; let each bit be near an inch 
thick; dip them, into vinegar, and then into a 
seasoning ready prepared of salt, black pepper, 
allspice, and a clove, all in fine powder, with 
parsley, chives, thyme, savoury, and knotted 
marjoram, shred as small as possible, and well 
mixed. With a sharp knife make holes deep 
enough to let in the larding ; then rub the beef 
over with the seasoning, and bind it up tight 
with tape. Set it in a well-tinned pot over a 
stove ; three or four onions must be fried b^own

and put to the beef, with two or three carrots, 
one turnip, a head or two of celery, and a small 
quantity of water ; let it simmer gently ten or 
twelve hours, or till extremely tender, turning 
the meat twice. 

Put the gravy into a pan, remove the fat, keep 
the beef covered, then put them together, and 
add a glass of port wine. Take off the tape, and 
serve with the vegetables; or you may strain 
them off, and send them up cut into dice for 
garnish. Onions roasted and then stewed with 
the gravy are a great improvement. A tea-cupful 
of vinegar should be stewed with the beef. 

Beef en Miroton, 

12. Cut thin slices of cold roast beef and put 
them into a frying-pan with a quarter pound of 
butter, and six onions, turn the pan frequently, 
then mix a little broth and some salt, pepper, and 
after a few boils serve up hot. This dish is 
excellent and economical. 

To stew a Rump of Beef 

13. Wash it well ; and season it high with 
pepper, Cayenne, salt, allspice, three cloves, and 
a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up 
tight, and lay it into a pot that will just hold it. 
Fry three large onions sliced, and put them to it, 
with three carrots, two turnips, a shalot, four 
cloves, a blade of mace, and some celery. Cover 
the meat with good beef-broth, or weak gravy.

till quite tender. Clear off the fat ; and add to 
the gravy half a pint of port wme, a glass of 
vinegar, and alarge spoonful of ketchup ; simmer 
half an hour, and serve in a deep dish. Mall a 
pint of beer may be added. The herbs to be 
used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, 
basil, savoury, marjoram, pennyroyal, knotted 
marjoram, and some chives if you can get them, 
but observe to proportion the quantities to the 
pungency of the several sorts ; let there be a 
good handful altogether. ^ ra a 

Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles and 
morels, or pickles of different colours, cut small, 
and laid in little heaps separate ; chopped 
parsley, chives, beet-root, &c. If, when done, 
the gravy is too much to fill the dish, take only 
a part to season for serving, but the less water 
the better ; and to increase the richness, add a 
few beef-bones and shanks of mutton in stewing.— 
A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great 
improvement to the gravy. 

To stew Brisket of Beef. 
14 Put the part that has the hard fat into a 
stew-pot, with a small quantity of water; let it 
boil up, and skim it thoroughly ; then add carrots, 
turnips, onions, celery, and a few pepper-corns. 
Stew till extremely tender; then take out the 
flat bones, and remove all the fat from the soup. 
Either serve that and the meat in a tureen ; or 
the soup alone, and the meat on a dish, 
garnished with some vegetables. The fol^wmg

sauce is much admired, served with the beef :— 
Take half a pint of the soup, and mix it with a 
spoonful of ketchup, a glass of port wine, a tea- 
spoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of 
butter, and salt ; boil all together a few minutes 
then pour it round the meat. Garnish as the 
former. 

To press Beef. 
15. Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank 
or the tops of the ribs, with salt and saltpetre 
tive days, then boil it gently till extremely 
tender: put it under a great weight, or in a 
cheese-press, till perfectly cold. 

It eats excellently cold, and makes good sand- 
wiches. 

Jin excellent mode of dressing Beef 
16. Hang three ribs three or four days ; take 
out the bones from the whole length, sprinkle it 
with salt, roll the meat tight, and roast it. 
JVothingcpn look nicer. The above done with 
spices, cfec, and baked, is excellent. 

To collar Beef 

11. Choose the thin end of the flank of fine 
mellow beef, but not too fat; lay it into a dish 
with salt and saltpetre, turn and rub it every day 
for a week, and keep it cool. Then take out 
every bone and gristle, remove the skin of the 
mside part, and cover it thick with the following 
seasoning cut small ; a large handful of parsley

pennyroyal, pepper, salt, and allspice. Roll the 
meat up as tight as possible, and bind it, then 
boil it gently for seven or eight hours. A cloth 
must be put round before the tape. Put the beef 
under a good weight while hot, without undoing 
it: the shape will then be oval. Part of a breast 
of veal rolled in with the beef, looks and eats 

very well. 

Beef-steaks 

18. Should be cut from a rump that has hung a 
few days. Broil them over a very clear or char- 
coal fire : put into the dish a little minced shalot, 
and a table-spoonful of ketchup ; and rub a bit 
of butter on the steak the moment of serving. 
It should be turned often, that the gravy may 
not be drawn out on either side. Pepper and 
salt should be added when taking it off the fire. 

Beef -steaks and Oyster-sauce. 

19. Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and 
throw them into cold water to take off the grit, 
while you simmer the liquor with a bit of mace 
and lemon-peel ; then put the oysters in, etew 
them a few minutes, add a little cream if you 
have it, and some butter rubbed in a bit of flour : 
let them boil up once ; and have rump-steaks, 
well seasoned and broiled, ready for throwing 
the oyster-sauce over, and serve. 

Italian Beef -steaks,

part* beat, it and season with pepper, salt, and 
onion; lay it in an iron stew-pan that has a 
cover to fit quite close, and set it by the side of 
the fire without water. Take care it does not 
burn, but it must have a strong heat: in two or 
three hours it will be quite tender, and then serve 
with its own gravy. 

Beef'Collop. 

21. Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or 
any other tender part, divide them into pieces 
three inches long : beat them with the blade 
of a knife, and flour them. Fry the collops quick 
in butter two minutes; then lay them into a 
small stewpan, and cover them with a pint of 
gravy ; add a bit of butter rubbed in flour, pep- 
per, salt, the least bit of shalot shred as fine as 
possible, half a walnut, four small pickled cu- 
cumbers, and a tea-spoonful of capers cut small. 
Take care that it does not boil; and serve the 
stew in a very hot covered dish. 

Round of Beef, 

22. Should be carefully salted, and wet with 
the pickle for eight or ten days. The bone should 
be cut out first, and the beef skewered and tied 
up to make it quite round. It may be fctuffed 
with parsley, if afiproved ; in which case the 
holes to admit the parsley must be made with 
a sharp pointed knife, and the parsley coarsely 
cut and stuffed in tight. As soon as it boils it 
should be skimmed, and afterwards kept boiling 
ver^ently. ^

To dress the inside of a cold Sirloin of Beef 

23. Cut out all the meat.and a little fat.in pieces 
as thick as your finger, and two inches long : 
dredge it with flour ; and fry in butter, of a nice 
brown ; drain the butter from the ireat, and toss 
it up in a rich gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
anchovy and shalot. Do not let it boil on any 
account. Before you serve, add two spoonfuls 
of vinegar. Garnish with crimpled parsley. 

Beef Cakes for a dde dish of dressed Meat, 

24. Pound some beef that is underdone with a 
little fat bacon, or ham; season with pepper, 
salt, and a little shalot, or garlic ; mix them well; 
and make into small cakes three inches long ; 
and half as wide and thick; fry them a light 
brown, and serve them in a good thick gravy. 

To dress cold Beef that has not been done 
enough, called Beef olives. 

25. Cut slices half an inch thick and four inches 
square; lay on them a forcemeat of crumbs of 
bread, shalot, a little suet, or fat, pepper and 
salt. Roll them, and fasten with a small skewer; 
put them into a stewpan with some gravy made 
of the beef bones, or the gravy of the meat, and 
a spoonful or two of water, and stew them till 
tender. Fresh meat will do. 

To mince Beef 

26. Shred thej|(iderdone part fine, with some 
of the fat ; put w into a small stew-pan, with

some onion or shalot, (a very little will do), a 
little water, pepper, and salt; boil it till the 
onion is quite soft, then put some of the gravy of 
the meat to it, and the mince. Don't let it boil. 
Have a small hot dish with sippets of bread 
ready, and pour the mince into it, but first mix 
a large spoonful of vinegar with it ; if shalot- 
vinegar is used there will be no need of the 
onion, nor the raw shalot. 

To hash Beef, 

21. Do it the same as in the last receipt; only 
the meat is to be in slices, and you may add a 
spoonful of walnut-liquor or ketchup. 

Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or 
minces that they get hard. All sorts of stews, 
meat dressed a second time, should be only 
simmered ; and this last only hot through. 

To pickle Tongues for boiling. 

28. Cut off the root, but leave a little of the 
kernel and fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it 
drain from the slime till next day; then for 
each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, 
th^ same of coarse sugar, and about half as much 
of saltpetre ; rub it well in, and do so every day. 
In a week add another heaped spoonful of salt. 
If rubbed every day, a tongue will be ready in 
a fortnight; but if only turned in the pickle 
daily, it will keep four or fim weeks without 
being too salt. ^|f

tender ; allo\* five hours ; and if done sooner, it 
is easily kept hot. The longer kept after drying 
the higher it will be: if hard, it may require 
soaking three or four hours. 

To roast Tongue and Udder. 

29. After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with 
common salt and saltpetre three days; then boil 
it, and likewise a fine young udder with some 
fat to it, till tolerably tender ; then tie the thick 
part of oiie to the thin part of the other, and 
roast the tongue and udder together. 

Serve them with good gravy, and currant-jelly 
sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder. 
This is an excellent dish. 

To stew Tongue. 

30. Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common 
salt for a week, turning it every day. Boil it 
tender enough to peel; when done, stew it in a 
moderately strong gravy ; season with soy, 
mushroom-ketchup, Cayenne, pounded cloves, 
and salt, if necessary. Serve with trufflec», 
morels, and mushrooms. In both thi's receipt 
and the next, the roots mnst be taken off the 
tongues before salting, but some fat left. 

An excellent way of doing Tongues to eat cold. 

31. Season with common salt and saltpetre, 
brown sugar, a little bay-salt, pepper, cloves, 
mace, and allspj|Mpin fine powder for a foi tnight ; 
then take away me pickle, put the tongue into

with brown crust, and bake slowly till so tender 
that a straw would go through it. 

The thin part of tongues, when hung up to 
dry, grates like hung beef, and almost makes a 
fine addition to the flavour of omelets. 

Beef-heart. 

82. Wash it carefully; for stuffing, use an 
anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, 

Eepper, salt, nutmeg, a little onion, crumbs of 
read, and an egg to bind it all, and serve rich 
gravy, and currant-jelly sauce. 

Hash with the same, and port wine. 

Stewed ox-cheek. 
33. Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before 
is to be eaten ; put it into a stew-pot that will 
cover close, with three quarts of water ; simmer 
it after it has first boiled up and been well-skim- 
med. In two hours put plenty of carrots, leeks, 
two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
some whole pepper, and four ounces of allspice. 
Skim it often ; whe,^ the m«-at is tender take it 
out,; let the soup get cold, take off the cake of 
fat, aod serve the soup separate or with the 
meat. 

It should be of a fine Jbrown ; which may be 
done by burnt sugar; or by frying some onions 
quite brown with flour, and,, simmering them 
With it. This last way improves the flavour of 
all soups and gravies of the brown kind.

If vegetables are not approved in the soup, 
they may be taken out, and a small roll bo toast- 
ed, or bread fried and added. Celery is a great 
addition, and should always be served. Where 
it is not to be got, the seed of it gives quite as 
good a flavour, boiled in and strained off. 

Stewed Beef Steaks. 

34. Stew the steaks in three parts of a pint of 
water, to which has been added a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two blades of mace, an onion stuck with 
cloves, say three, an anchovy, and a lump of 
butter soaked in flour, pour over a glass of 
Sherry or Madeira. Stew with the pan covered 
down, until the steaks are tender, but not too 
much so ; then place them in a frying-pan with 
enough of fresh butter, hissing hot,to cover them, 
fry them brown, pour off the fat, and in its place 
pour into the pan the gravy in which the steaks 
were stewed ; when the gravy is thoroughly 
heated, and is of a rich consistency, place the 
steaks in a hot dish — pour the sauce over them. 
The steaks should be large, the finest from the 
rump, and have a due proportion of fat with 
them. 

Beef Cake. 

35. Choose lean beef — it should also be very 
tender— if a pound, put six ounces of beef suet, 
mince finely and season with cloves, mace, and 
salt, in fine powder — put the largest proportion 
of salt and least of mace — add half the quantity 
of the latter of Cayenne ; cut into thin slices a

pound of bacon, and lay them all round the inside 
but not at the bottom, of a baking dish ; put in 
the meat, pressing it closely down, cover it with 
the remaining slices of bacon, lay a plate over it 
face downwards, and upon it something heavy to 
keep it from shifting. If there be three pounds 
of beef, bake two hours and a half; remove the 
bacoH and serve with a little rich gravy. These 
cakes may be made of mutton, veal, or venison. 

Ox'feet or Cow-heels^ 

36. May be dressed in various ways, and are 
very nutritious in all. Boil them ; and serve in a 
napkin, with melted butter, mustard, and a large 
spoonful of vinegar. 

Or boil them very tender, and serve them as 
a brown fricassee : the liquor will do to make 
jelly sweet or relishing, and likewise to give 
richness to soups or gravies. 

Or cut them into four parts, dip them into an

(if you like them,) to serve round. Sauce as 
above. Or bake them as for mock-turtle.

Soused Tripe, 

88. Boil the tripe, but not quite tender ; then 
put it into salt and water, which must be chan- 
ged every day till it is all used. When you dress 
the tripe, dip it into a batter of flour and eggs, 
and fry it of a good brown. 

Marrow-bones, 

39. Cover the top with floured cloth ; boil them 
and serve with dry toast. 

Veal, 

[There is more difficulty in the choice of veal than any 
other meat, although it is generally thought the easiest. 
The preference is sometimes given to the cow calf, from 
its being whiter and having the udder ; but if a bull calf 
has been properly fed, and killed at about ten weeks old, 
nothing can be finer in flavour or closer in grain when 
cooked, and will be much more juicy than the cow calf. 
The grain should be close, firm, and white, the fat a pinkish 
white, not a dead white, and the kidneys well covered with 
thick white fat ; this is first-class veal. The second quality 
is darker in flesh, and equally as nourishing as the first ; 
the third quality will have less fat round the kidney, be 
coarser grained, and the lean red. It is often as nourish- 
ing as the white, but not so delicate or digestible. It is 
caused by the calf being reared in the open air. If the 
suet under the kidney is soft and clammy the meat is not 
flresh. The neck is the first joint that becomes tainted. 
Calves' liver should be firm, free from gristle or spois, and 
the heart surrounded with fat. When veal is to be kept, it 
should be hung up, and not allowed to rest on anything, 
or it soon becomes tainted.] 

To keep a leg of Veal. 

40, The first part that turns bad of a leg of 
veal, is where the udder is skewered back. The

skewer should be taken out, ind both that and 
the part under it wiped every day, by which 
means it will keep good three or four days, in 
hot weather. Take care to cut out the pipe that 
runs along the chine of a loin of veal, as you do 
of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of 
the breast of veal is likewise to be taken off; 
and the inside of the breast wiped and scraped, 
and sprinkled with a little salt. 

Leg of Veal, 

41. Let the fillet be cut large or small as best 
suits the number of your company. Take out 
the bone, fill the space with a fine stufiiog, and 
let it be skewered quite round ; and send the 
large side uppermost. When half-roasted, if not 
before, put a paper over the fat ; and take care 
to allow a sufficient time, as the meat ib v^ery 
solid ; serve with melted butter poured c v^tv it.- - 
You may pot some of it. 

Shoulder of Veal. 

42. Cut off the knuckle for a stew or gravy. 
Roast the other part with stuffing : you may lard 
it. Serve with melted butter. 

. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left 
on, eats extremely well with mushroom or 
oyster-sauce, or mushioom -ketchup in butter. 

Neck of Veal, 

43. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with 
onion-sauce. It should be boiled in milk and

water. Parsley and butter may be served with 
it, instead of onion-sauce. 

Or it may be stewed with whole rice, small 
onions, and peppor-corns, with a very little water. 

Or boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. 

The best end may be either rousted, broiled 
as steaks, or made into pie*!. 

Breast of Veal. 

44. Before roasted, if large, the two ends may 
be taken off and fried to stew, or the whole may 
be roasted. Butter should be poured over it. 

If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome 
sizes, put them into a stewpan, and pour some 
broth over it ; or if you have no broth, a little 
water will do ; add a bunch of herbs, a blade or 
two of mace, some pepper, and an anchovy ; stew 
till the meat is tender, thicken with butter and 
flour, and add a little ketchup ; or the whole 
breast may be stewed, after cutting off the two 
ends. 

Serve the sweetbread whole upon it : which 
may either be stewed, or parboiled, and then 
covered with crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, 
and browned. 

If you have a few mushrooms, truflBies, and 
morels, stew them with it, and serve. 

Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion- 
sauce, is an excellent dish if not old nor too fat. 

To roll a Breast of Veal.

it with herbs chopped very fine, mixed with 
salt, pepper, and mace. Lay some thick slices of 
fine ham ; or roll into it two or three calves' 
tongues of a fine red, boiled first an hour or two 
and skimmed. Bind it up tight in a cloth, and 
tape it. Set it over the fire to simmer in a small 
quantity of water, till it is quite tender , this 
will take some hours. Lay it on the dresser, 
with a board and weight on it till quite cold. 

Pigs' or calves' feet, boiled and taken from the 
bones, may oe put in or round it. The different 
colours laid in layers look well when cut; and 
you may put in yolks of eggs boiled, beet-root, 
grated ham, and chopped parsley, in different 
parts. 

Do another way, 

46 When it is cold, take off the tape, and 
pour over it the liquor ; which must be boiled 
up twice a week, or it will not keep. 

Veal rolls of either cold meat or fresh 
47. Cut thin slices, and spread on them a fine 
seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped 
bacon or scraped ham, and a little suet, parsley, 
and shalot, (or instead of the parsley and shalot^ 
some fresh mushrooms stewed and minced,) pep- 
per, salt, and a small piece of pounded mace. 

This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a 
sausage, or be rolled with the meat. Ili either 
case tie it up very tight, and stew it very slow- 
ly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. 
Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely.

Harrico of Veal, 

48. Take the best end of a small neck ; cut the 
bones short, but leave it whole: then put it into 
a stewpan just covered with brown gravy ; and 
when it is nearly done, have ready a pint of boil- 
ed peas, six cucumbers pared and sliced, and two 
cabbage-lettuces cut into quarters, all stewed in 
a little good broth : put them to the veal, and 
let them simmer ten minutes. When the veal is 
in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it 
and lay the lettuce with forcemeat-balls round it! 

Minced Veal, 

49. Cut cold veal as fine as possiblcjbut do not 
chop it. — Put to it a very little lemon-peel shred, 
two grates of nutmeg, some salt, and four or five 
spoonfuls of either a'little weak broth, milk, or 
water ; simmer these gently with the meat, but 
take care not to let it boil ; and add a bit of but- 
ter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of thin toasted 
bread, cut into a three-cornered shape, round the 
dish. 

To pot VeaL 

60. Cold fillet makes the finest potted veal; or 
you may do it as follows : 

Season a large slice of the fillet before it is 
dressed, with some mace, pepper-corns, and two 
or three cloves ; lay it close into a potting-pan 
that will but just hold it, fill it up with water, 
and bake it three hours ; then pound it quite 
small in a mortar, and add salt to taste: put a 
little gravy that was baked with it in pounding if

to be eaten soon ; otherwise only a little butter 
just melted. When aone cover it ov«r with 
butter. 

To pot Veal or Chicken with Ham. 

51. Pound some cold veal or white of chicken, 
seasoned as directed in the last article, and put 
layers of it with layers of ham pounded or rather 
shred ; press each down and cover with butter. 

Veal Collops, 

52. Cut long thin collops ; beat them well ; 
and lay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same 
size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned 
high, and also a little garlic and Cayenne. Roll 
them up tight, about the size of two fingers, but 
not more than two or three inches long; put a 
very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg 
over ; fry them of a fine brown, and pour a rich 
brown gravy over. 

To dress Collops quick. 

53. Cut them as thin as possible with a very 
sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, 
and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, 
with a dust of pepper and salt; set them on the 
fire while you beat the collops ; and dip them 
into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, 
and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. 
Then put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and 
give the collops a very quick fry ; for as they 
are so thin, two minutes will do them on both 



VEAL. 



109 



sides : put them into a hot dish before the fire ; 
then strain and thicken the gravy, give it a boil 
in the frying-pan, and poiir it over the collops. 
A little ketchup is an improvement. 

64. Another way. — Fry them in butter,only sea- 
soned with salt and pepper ; then simmer them in 
gravy eii>her white or brown, with bits of bacon 
served with them. 

If white, add lemon-peel and mace, and some 
cream. 

Scallops of cold Veal or Chicken, 

55. Mince the meat extremely small : and set 
it over the fire with a scrape of nutmeg, a little 
pepper and salt, and a little cream, for a few 
minutes ; then put it into the scallop-shells, and 
fill them with crumbs of bread, over which put 
some bits of butter, and brown them before the 
fire. 

Either veal or chicken looks and eats well pre- 
pared in this way, and lightly covered with 
crumbs of bread fried ; or these may be put on 
in little heaps. 

Veal Cutlets. 

56. Cut slices about three-quarters of an inch 
thick, beat them with a rolling-pin, and wet 
them on both sides with egg : dip 'them into a 
seasoning of bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, 
knotted marjoram, pepper, salt and a little 
nutmeg grated ; then put them into papers folded 
over, and broil them ; and have in a boat melted - 
butter, with a little mushroom ketchup.

Fricandeau of Veal. 

67. Cut a large piece from the fat side of a leg, 

about nine inches long, and half as thick and 

broad ; beat it with the rolling-pin ; take off the 

skin, and trina off the rou.rh edges. Lard the top 

and sides ; and cover it with fat bacon, and then 

with white paper. Lay it into the stew pan 

with any pieces of undressed veal or mutton, 

four onions, a carrot sliced, a faggot of sweet 

herbs, four blades of mace, four bay-leaves, a 

pint of good veal or mutton broth, and four or 

five ounces of lean ham or gammon. Cover the 

pan close, and let it stew slowly thi ^e hours ; 

then take up the meat, remove all the fat from 

the gravy, and boil it quick to a glaze. Keep 

the fricandeau quite hot, and then glaze it; and 

serve with the remainder of the elaze in the dish, 

and sorrel-sauce in a sauce tureen. 

A cheaper, but equally good, Fricandeau of Veal. 
58. With a sharp knife cut the lean part of a 
large neck from the best end, scooping it from 
the bones the length of your hand, and prepare 
it the same way as in the last receipt : three or 
four bones only will be necessary, and they will 
make the gravy ; but if the prime part of the leg 
is cut off, it spoils the whole. 

Fricandeau another t^^ai/.— Take two large round 
sweetbreads, and prepare them as you would 
veal ; make a rich gravy with truffles, morels, 
mushrooms, and artichoke-bottoms, and serve It

60. Another. — Prepare as before, and dress the 
cutlets in an oven ; pour over them melted 
butter and mushrooms. 

Or, pepper, salt, and broil them, especially 
neck steaks. They are excellent without herbs. 

Veal Olives. 

61. Cut long thin collops, beat them, lay on 
them thin slices of fat bacon, and over these a 
layer of forcemeat seasoned high^ with some 
shred shalot and Cayenne. Roll them tight, 
about the size of two fingers, but not more than 
two or three inches long ; fasten them round 
with a small skewer, rub egg over them, and fry 
of a light brown. Serve with brown gravy, in 
which boil some mushrooms pickled or fresh. 
Garnish with balls fried. 

Veal Cake, 

62. Boil six or eight eggs hard ; cut the yolks 
in two, and lay some of the pieces in the bot- 
tom of the pot : shake in a little chopped parsley, 
some slices of veal and ham, add then eggs 
again ; shaking in after each some chopped pars- 
ley, with pepper and salt, till the pot is full. 
Then put in water enough to cover it, and lay

OD it about an ounce of butter; tie it over TVith 

a double paper, and bake it about an hour. 

Then press it close together with a spoon, and 

let it stand till cold. 

^ It may be put into a small mould ; and then 

It will turn out beautifully for a supper or side 

dish. 

Veal Sausages, 

63. Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat 
bacon, some sage, a little salt, pepper, and a few 
anchovies. Beat all in a mortar, and when used 
roll and fry it, and serve with fried sippets, or 
on stewed vegetables, or on white collops. 

Scotch Collops 

64. Cut veal into thin bits about three inches 
over, and rather round.; beat with a rolling-pin 
and grate a little nutmeg over them: dip into 
the yolk of an egg; and fry them in a little but- 
ter of a fane brown: pour the butter off: and 
have ready warm to pour upon them half a pint 
of gravy, a little bit of butter rubbed into a 
little flour a yolk of egg, two large spoonfuls of 
cream, and a bit of salt. Don't boil the sauce, 
but stir It till of a fine thickness to serve with

Serve bacon and greens to eat with it. 

The brains must be boiled ; and then mixed 
with melted butter, scalded sage chopped, 
pepper, and salt. 

If any of the head is left, it may be hashed 
next day, and a few slices of bacon just warmed 
and put round. 

Cold calf's head eats well if grilled. 

To hash Calfs Head, 

(jQ. When half-boiled, cut off the meat in slices, 
half-an-inch thick, and two or three inches long : 
brown some butter, flour, and sliced onion, and 
throw in the slices with some good gravy, truf- 
fles, and morels; give it one boil, skim it well, 
and set it in a moderate heat to simmer till very 
tender. Season with pepper, salt, and Cayenne, 
at first ; and tes minutes before serving, throw in 
some shred parsley, and a very small bit of 
tarragon and knotted marjoram cut as fine as 
possible; just before you serve, add the squeeze 
of a lemon. Forcemeat balls, and bits of bacon 
rolled round. 

6V . Another way. — Boil the head almost enough 
and take the meat of the best side nearly off the 
bone with a sharp knife; lay this into a small 
dish, wash it over with the yolks of two eggs, and 
cover it with crumbs, a few herbs nicely shred, a 
little pepper and salt, and a grate of nutmeg, all 
mixed together first. Set the dish before the fire ;

and keep turning it now and then, that all parts 
of the head may be equally brown. In the mean- 
time slice the remainder of the head and the 
tongue, but first peel the tongue: put a pint of 
good gravy into a pan, with an onion, a small 
bunch of herbs (consisting of parsley, basil, sa- 
voury, tarragon, knotted morjoram, and a little 
thyme), a little salt and Cayenne, a shalot, a glass 
of sherry, and a little oyster-liquor. Boil this for 
a few minutes, and strain it upon the meat, which 
should be dredged with some flour. Add some 
mushrooms either fresh or pickled, a few truffles 
and morels, and two spoonfuls of ketchup ; then 
beat up half the brains, and put this to the rest 
with a bit of butter and flour. Simmer the whole. 
Beat the other part of the brains with shred 
lemon-peel, and a little nutmeg and mace, some 
parsley shred, and an egg. Then fry it in little 
cakes of a beautiful yellow brown. Dip some 
oysters into the yolk of an egg, and do the same; 
and also some relishing forcemeat-balls made as 
for mock-turtle. G-arnish with these, and small 
bits of bacon just made hot before the fire. 

To collar Calfs Head, 

68. Scald the skin off a fine head,clean it nicely 
and take out the brains. Boil it tender enough 
to remove the bones ; then have ready a good 
quantity of chopped parsley, mace, nutmeg, salt 
and white pepper, mixed well ; season it high 
with these ; lay the parsley in a thick layer, then

Pork, 




[The quality of pork entirely depends on the feeding. One 
thing is very certain^ that whatever a pig is fed upon it 
will be much better m size and quality it kept clean md 
washed once a week ; the old saying, " the hog thri/es 
best in mire," does not hold good. Those breeds that pro- 
duce a fine close-grained meat, not too much fat, and tiat 
Arm, solid and pinkish white, are the best ; if the tongue 
is clean and full, the animal has been well fed and the tesh 
is healthy. The flesh of the second quality of pork :vill 
be hard and red, and the fat of a yellow white. The neat 
of the the third quality, will be coarse-grained, the fat 
soft, and the tongue and kidneys discoloured. Measly 
pork will be known by the small kernels in the fat. I' the 
flesh IS clammy and moist it is not fresh. The best wiy to 
judge the freshness of this, or other meat, is to take with 
you, in hot weather, a wooden skewer, and insert it ii the 
flesh near the bone, and the smell will detect it Inme- 
diately, this is much better than touching the meat The 
skm of a sucking pig should be clear and fresh, the tcngue 
clean, the flesh of a pinkish hue, and not too large in size. 
In roastmg or boiling, ample time should be allowed for 
the jomt. Pork is always salted for boiling.] 

Salt Pork. 

8D. Take a four-quart pan, cut up some pork 
and greens, remove the stalk, slice them, and also 
add four onions sliced, four cloves, and one tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; press it well down ; put over 
it a quarter of a pound of dripping, add a pint of 
water, and stew for three hours ; a little salt may 
be added if the pork is not salt enough ; it will 
make an excellent soup if filled up with water 
half an hour previous to using. Red cabbage 
may also be used, but first boiled for ten minutes 
in plain water ; then add half a pint of vinegar 
*nd twelve pepper-corns, if handy.

intD a pau, w'th a quart of peas; fill up with 
water, add two tea-spoonfuls of salt, one of 
pepper, one of sugar, two onions; bake for three 
hours. Salt beef is also good done this way ; a 
little mint may be added. Three pints of large 
peas alone, with a little dripping, is also very 
nice. 

Pork and Cabbage. 

82. Cut two good Savoy cabbages in thin slices, 
wash them, put half in pan, then a piece of pork 
about two pounds, or either ham, bacon, or salt 
beef; season as foregoing receipt, add the re- 
mainder of the cabbage; season again; add, if 
you have it, four cloves, or pepper-corns, four 
unions, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; do not fill 
tt with water to the brim, or it will boil over. 
Red eabbiige may be used the same way, only 
adding half a pint of vinegar, and if beef, two 
ounces of dripping. Harricot beans, and other 

'>ulse, may be done precisely the same way. In 
tact, all dried pulse may be here used, and we 
cannot too strongly recommend both the dried 
harricot beans and lentils. 

Spring or Forehand of Pork, 

83. Cut out the bone ; sprinkle salt, pepper, 
and sage dried, over the inside ; but first warm 
a little butter to baste it, and then flour it ; roll 
the pork tight, and tie it ; then roast about two 
hours.

To roast a Leg of Pork, 

84. Choose a leg of fine young pork : cut a slit 
in the knuckle with a sharp knife ; and fill the 
space with sage and onion chopped, and a little 
pepper and salt. When half-done, score the skin 
in slices, but don't cut deeper than the outer 
rind. Apple-sauce, No. 27, and potatoes should 
be served to eat with it. 

To boil a Leg of Pork, 

86. Salt it eight or ten days : when it is to be 
dressed, weigh it ; let it lie half an hour in cold 
water to make it white ; allow twenty minutes 
for every pound, from the time it boils up ; skim 
it as soon as it boils, and frequently after. Allow 
water enough. Save some of it to make peas- 
soup. Some boil it in a very nice cloth, floured ; 
which gives a very delicate look, It should be 
small and of a fine grain . 

Serve peas pudding and turnips with it. 

Shoulders and Breasts of Pork. 

86. Put them into pickle, or salt the shoulders 
as the leg ; when very nice, they may be roasted. 

Rolled Neck of Pork. 

Si. Bone it ; put a forcemeat of chopped 
sage, a few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper 
and two or three berries of allspice, over 
the inside; then roll the meat as tight as 
you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good dis- 
tance at first.

and a little flour, then sprinkled with dried sage

Pork Griskin 

90. Is usually very hard ; the best way to pre- 
vent this is, to put it into as much cold water as 
will cover it, and let it boil up ; then instantly 
take it off, and put it into the oven : a very few 
minutes will do it. Remember to rub butter 
over it, and then flour it, before you put it to 
the fire. 

Blade-hone of Pork, 

91. Is taken from the bacon-hog ; the less meat 
left on it in moderation, the better. It is to be 
broiled ; and when just done, pepper and salt it. 
Put to it a piece of butter, and a tea-spoonful of 
mustard ; and serve it covered, quickly. A nice 
lunch. 

To dress Pork as Lamb. 

92. Kill a young pig of four or five months 
old ; cut up the fore quarter for roasting as you 
do lamb, and truss the shank close. The other 
parts will make delicate pickled pork ; or steaks,

naoment they are taken off the fire, a few at a 
time. 

Sausages. 

94. Chop fat and lean of pork together; season 
it with sage, pepper, and salt, and you may add 
two or three berries of allspice ; half fill hogs* 
guts that have been soaked and made very clean ; 
or the meat may be kept in a very small pan, 
closely covered ; and so rolled and dusted with 
a very little flour before it is fried. Serve on 
stewed red cabbage; or mash potatoes put in a 
form, brown with salamander, and garnish with 
the above ; they must be pricked with a fork 
before they are dressed, or they will burst. 

*dn excellent Sausage to eat cold. 

96. Season lean and fat pork with some salt, 
saltpetre, black pepper, and allspice, all in fine 
powder, and rub into the meat ; the sixth day 
cut it small ; and mix with it some shred shalot 
or garlic, as fine as possible. Have ready an 
ox-gut that has been scoured, salted and soaked 
well, and fill it with the above stuffing ; tie up 
the ends, and hang it to smoke as you would 
hams, but first wrap it h.. :k fold or two of old 
muslin. It must be hii^ a Tied. Some eat it 
without boiling, but oth^ iike it boiled first.

The skin should be tied in different places, so as 
to make each link about eight or nine inches 
long.

96. Chop a pound and a half of pork, and the 
same of veal, cleared of skin and sinews ; and 
three quarters of a pound of beef suet ; mince 
and mix them ; steep the crumb of a small loaf 
in water, and mix it with the meat, with also a 
little dried sage, pepper, and salt. 

To scald a Sucking Pig, 

9V. The moment the pig is killed, put it into 
cold water for a few minutes ; then rub it over 
with a little resin beaten extremely small, and 
put it into a pail of scalding water half a minute ; 
take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair 
as quickly as possible ; if any part does not come 
off put it in again. When quite clean, wash it 
well with warm water, and then in two or three 
col 1 waters, that no flavour of the resin may 
remain. Take off all the feet at the first joint; 
make a slit down the belly, and take out the 
entrails ; put the liver, heart and lights to the 
feet. Wash the pig well in cold water, dry it 
thoroughly, and fold it in a wet cloth to keep it 
from the air.

of great advantage. Let it be scalded which the

onions, crumbs of bread, salt and pepper, into 

the belly, and sew it up. Observe to skewer 

the legs back, or the under part will not crisp. 

Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry ; then 

have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub 

the pig with it in every part. Dredge as much 

flour over as will possibly lie, and do not touch 

it again till ready to serve; then scrape off the 

flour very carefully with a blunt knife, rub it 

well with the buttered cloth, and take off the 

head while at the fire; take out the brains, and 

mix them with the gravy that comes from the 

pig. Then take it up ; and, without withdraw 

ing the spit, cut it down the back and belly ; lay 

it into the dish, and chop the sage and bread 

quickly as fine as you can, and mix them with 

a large quantity of fine melted butter that has 

very little flour. Put the sauce into the dish 

after the pig has been split down the back, and 

garnished with the ears and the two jaws; take 

off the upper part of the head down to the 

snout, or served whole, if small; the head only 

being cut off, to garnish as above. 

Pettitoes, 

99. Boil them, the liver, and the heart, in a 
small quantity of water, very gently ; then cut 
the meat fine, and simmer it with a little of the 
water and the feet split, till the feet are quite 
tender ; thicken with a bit of butter, a little 
flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and 
pepper ; give it a boil up, pour it over a few sip- 
pets of bread, and put the feet on the mince.

To make excellent meat of a Hog^s Head, 

100. Split the head, take out the brains, cut 
off the ears, and sprinkle it with common salt for 
a day ; then drain it ; salt it well with common 
salt and saltpetre three days, then lay the salt 
and head into a small quantity of water for (>wo 
days. Wash it, and boil till all the bones will 
come out ; remove them, and chop the head as 
quick as possible ; but first skin the tongue, and 
take the skin carefully off the head, to put under 
and over. Season with pepper, salt, and a little 
mace or allspice berries. Put the skin into a small 
pan, press the cut head in, and put the other 
skin over ; press it down. When cold, it will 
turn out, and make a kind of brawn. If too fat, 
you may put a few bits of lean pork to be pre- 
pared the same way. Add salt and vinegar, and 
boil these with some of the liquor for a pickle to 
keep it. 

To collar Pig^s Head, 

101. Scour the head and ears nicely ; take off 
the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and 
the brain ; lay it into water one night; then 
drain, salt it well with common salt and salt- 
petre, and let it lie five days. Boil it enough to 
take out the bones ; then lay it on the table, 
turning the thick end of one side of the head 
towards the thin end of the other, to make the 
roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well with salt and 
white pepper, and roll it with the ears ; and if 
you approve, put the pig's feet round the out-

side when boned, or the thin parts of two cow- 
heels. Put it in a cloth, bind with a broad tape, 
and boil it till quite tender ; then put a good 
weight upon it, and don't take off the covering 
till cold. ^ 

If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it 
longer, and let the proportion of saltpetre be 
greater ; and put in also some pieces of lean pork 
and then cover it with cow-heel, to look like the 
horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle 
of salt and water boiled with vinegar ; and is a 
very convenient thing to have in the house. If 
likely to spoil, slice and fry it either with or 
without batter. 

To roast Porker's Head. 

102. Choose a fine young head, clean it well, 
and put bread and sage and onion, as for pig ; sew 
It up tight, and roast it as a pig, and serve with 
sauce JSfo. 27. 

To dry Hog's Cheeks, 

103. Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and 
split the head, taking off the upper bone, to 
make the chowl a good shape ; rub it well with 
salt ; next day take away the brine, and salt it 
again the following day: cover the head with 
half an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay-salt 
a httle common salt, and four ounces of coarse 
sugar. Let the head be often turned ; after ten 
days smoke it for a week, like bacon.

To prepare Pig's Cheek for boiling, 

104. Cut off the snout, and clean the head ; 
divide it, and take out the eyes and the brains ; 
sprinkle the head with salt, and let it drain 
twenty-four hours. Salt it with common salt and 
saltpetre : let it lie eight or ten days if to be dress- 
ed without stewing peas, but less if to be dressed 
with peas; and it must be washed first, and 
then simmered till all is tender. 

Different ways of dressing Pig's Feet and Ears. 

106. Clean carefully, and soak some hours, and 
boil them tender ; then take them out ; boil some 
vinegar and a little salt with some of the water, 
and when cold put it over them. When they are 
to be dressed, dry them, cut the feet in two, and 
slice the ears ; fry, and serve with butter, mus- 
tard, and vinegar. They may be either done in 
batter, or only floured.

till every bone can be taken out ; throw in half 
a handful of chopped sage, the same of parsley, 
and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and mace, in 
fine powder ; simmer till the herbs are scalded, 
then pour the whole into a melon-form. 

Pig's Harslet, 

108. Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads,and 
fat and lean bits of pork, beating the latter with 
a rolling-pin to make it tender ; season with 
pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion shred fine ; 
when mixed, put all into a cawl, and fasten it 
up tight with a needle and thread. Then roast. 

Or serve in slices with parsley for a fry. 
Serve with a sauce of port-wine and water, and 
mustard, just boiled up and put into the dish. 

Mock Brawn. 

109. Boil a pair of neat's feet very tender; take 
the meat off, and have ready the belly-piece of 
pork salted with common salt and saltpetre for 
a week. Boil this almost enough ; take out any 
bones, and roll the feet and the pork together. 
Then roll it very tight with a strong cloth and 
coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang 
it up in the cloth till cold; after whi«h keep it 
in a sousing-liquor, as is next directed. 

Souse for Brawn, and for Pig's Feet and Ears. 

110. Boil a quarter of a peck of wheat bran, a

To dress Hams. 



129 



111. If long hung, put the ham into water a 
night ; and let it lie either in a hole dug in the 
earth, or on damp stones sprinkled with water, 
two or three days, to mellow ; covering it with 
a heavy tub, to* keep vermin from it. Wash 
well, and put it into a boiler with plenty of 
water ; let it simmer four, five, or six hours, 
according to the size. When done enough, if 
before the time of serving, cover it with a clean 
cloth doubled, and keep the di«h hot over boiling 
water. Take off the skin, and strew raspings 
over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve 
the skin as whole as possible, to keep over the 
ham when cold, which will prevent its drying. 

To make Black Puddings, 

112. The blood must be stirred with salt till 
cold. Put a quart of it, or rather more, to a 
quart of whole grits, to soak one night; and 
soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather more 
than two quarts of new milk made hot. In the 
meantime prepare the guts by washing, turning, 
and scraping with salt and water, and changing 
the water several times. Chop fine a little winter 
savoury and thyme, a good quantity of penny- 
royal, pepper, and salt, a few cloves, some all- 
spice, ginger, and nutmeg; mix these with three 
pounds of beef suet, and six eggs well beaten 
and strained ; and then beat the bread, grits, 
&e., all up with the seasoning : when well mixed, 
have ready some hog's fat cut into large bits;

and a8 you fill the skins, put it in at proper 
distances. Tie in links, only half filled ; and boil 
in a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or 
they will burst. When boiled lay them between 
clean cloths till cold, and hang them up in the 
kitchen. When to be used, scald them a few 
minutes in water, wipe and put them into the 
oven. 

If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing 
into basins, und boil it covered with floured 
cloths ; and slice and dry it when used. 

118. Another way. — Soak all night a quart of 
bruised grits in as much boiling hot milk as will 
Bwell them and leave half a pint of liquid. Chop 
% good quantity of pennyroyal, some savoury 
and thyme ; salt, pepper, and allspice, finely 
powdered. Mix the above with a quart of the 
blood, prepared as before directed, and half fill 
the skins, and puu as much of the leaf (that is, 
the inward fat) of the pig as will make it pretty 
rich. Boil as before directed. A small quantity 
of leeks finely shred and well mixed, is a great 
improvement. 

White Hog*s Pudding, 

114. When the skins have been soaked and 
cleaned as before directed, rinse and soak them 
all night in rose-water, and put into them the 
following filling: — Mix half a pound of blanched 
almonds cut into seven or eight bits, with a 
pound of grated bread, two pounds of marrow or 
suet, a pound of currants, some beaten cinnamon,

cloves, mace, and nutmeg, a quart of cream, the 
yolks of six and whites of two eggs, a little 
orange-flower water, a little fine Lisbon sugar, 
and some lemon-peel and citron sliced, and half 
fill the skins. To know whether sweet enough, 
warm a little in a panikin. In boiling, much 
care must be taken to prevent the puddings from 
bursting. Prick them with a small fork as they 
rise, and boil them in milk and water. Lay them 
in a table-cloth till cold. 

Hog's Lard 

116. Should be carefully melted in ajar put into 
a kettle of water, and boiled, run it into bladders 
that have been well cleaned. The smaller they 
are the better the lard keeps ; as after the air 
reaches it, it becomes rank. Put in a sprig of 
rosemary when melting. 

This being a most useful article for frying fish, 
it should be prepared with care. Mixed with 
butter, it makes fine crust. 

To cure Hams, 

116 Hang them a day or two ; then sprinkle 
them with a little salt, and drain them another 
day ; pound an ounce and a half of saltpetre, the 
same quantity of bay-salt, half an ounce of sal- 
prunel, and a pound of the coarsest sugar. Mix 
these well ; and rub them into each ham every 
day for four days, and turn it. If a small one, 
turn it every day for three weeks; if a large 
one, a week longer ; but don't rub after four 





132

days. Before you dry it, drain and cover with 
bran. Smoke it ten days. 

117. Another way. — Choose the leg of a hog 
that is fat and well-fed ; hang it as above ; if 
large, put to it a pound of bay salt, four ounces 
of saltpetre, a pound of the coarsest sugar, and 
a handful of common salt, all in fine powder, 
and rub it thoroughly. Lay the rind downwards 
and cover the fleshy part with the salts. Baste 
it as often as you can with the pickle ; the more 
the better. Keep it four weeks, turning it every 
day. Drain it, and throw bran over it; then 
hang it in a chimney where wood is burnt, and 
turn it occasionally for ten days. 

118.-4 method of giving a higher flavour, — 
Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung two 
or three days ; let it drain ; make a pickle of a 
quart of strong beer, half a pound of treacle, an 
ounce of coriander-seeds, two ounces of juniper- 
berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of 
allspice, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of 
sal-prunel, a handful of common salt, and a head 
of shalot, all pounded or cnt fine. Boil these all 
together a few minutes, and pour them over the 
ham : this quantity is for one of ten pounds. Rub 
and turn it every day, for a fortnight ; then sew 
it up in a thin linen bag, smoke it three weeks.

four ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, 
an ounce of sal-prunel, and a little common salt ; 
sprinkle the pork with salt, and drain it twenty- 
four hours; then rub with the above ; pi/ the 
pieces tight in a small deep tub, filling up the 
spaces with common salt. Place large pebbles 
on the pork to prevent it from swimming in the 
pickle which the salt will produce. If kept from 
air, it will continue very fine for two years. 

To make a Pickle that will keep for years, for 
Hams, Tongues, or Beef if boiled and skimmed 
between each parcel of them, 

120. To two gallons of spring- water put two 
pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay, and 
two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a 
pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan 
that will hold four gallons, and with a cover that 
will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as 
they will bear, before you put them into the 
pickle ; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in 
a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the 
hams, <fec., well with the pickle, and pack them 
in close; putting as much as the pan will hold, 
so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle 
is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may 
lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks ; a 
tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion to 
its size. They will eat well out of the pickle 
without drying. When they are to be dried, let 
each piece be drained, over the pan ; and when 
it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and

dry it thoroughly. Six or eight ho'ars will smoke 
them, and there should be only a little sawdust 
and wet straw burnt to do this ; but if put into 
a baker's chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and 
let them hang a week. 

Excellent Bacon. 

121. Divide the hog, and take the chine out : 
it is common to remove the spare-ribs, but the 
bacon will be preserved better from being rusty 
if they are left in. Salt the bacon p'x days, then 
drain it from that first pickle; mix iS much salt 
as you judge proper with eight ounces of bay- 
sftlt, three ounces of saltpetre, and a pound of 
coarse sugar, to each hog, but first cut off the 
hams. jRub the salt well in, and turn it every 
day for a month. Drain, and smoke it a few days; 
or dry without, by hanging in the kitchen, not 
near the fire.

122. Sprinkle each flitch with salt.and let the 
blood drain off for twenty-four hours : then mix 
a pound and a half of coarse sugar, the same 
quantity ot bay-salt, not quite so much as half a 
pound of saltpetre, and a pound of common salt ; 
and rub this well on the bacon, turning it every 
diay for a month; then hang it to dry, and after- 
wards smoke it ten days. This quantity of salts 
la sufficient for the whole hog^

MUTTON. 



Mutton, 



186 



[Sheep between four and five years old produce the finest 
quality of mutton, but it is seldom got above three, and 
often under two years. The flesh should be a darkish, 
clear, red colour; the fat white and firm, the meat short 
and tender when pinched, and ought not to be too fat. 
The fat of second quality mutton is rather spongj the 
lean close, rough grained, a deep red, and the fat adheres 
firmly to the meat. Third quality mutton may be from a^ 
sheep which has had some disense and recovered ; the 
liver, would always show this, but as butchers generally 
remove it, and do not let it be seen, you cannot judge from 
it',. The flesh. however, will be paler, the fat a faint white,' 
aiid the flesh loose from the bone ; if very bad and diseas- 
ed, the fat will be yellow, and the lean flabby and moist. 
To ascertain if it is fresh, use skewerb, as for pork.] 

On keeping and dressing Mutton, 

128. Cut out the pipe that runs along the bone 
inside of a chine of mutton ; and if to be kept a 
great time, rub the part close round the tail 
with salt, after cutting out th^ kernel. 

The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the 
leg should be taken out by the butcher, for it 
lamts first there. The chine and rib-bones should 
be wiped every day ; and the bloody part of the 
neck be cut off, to preserve it. The brisket 
changes first in the breast; and if it is to be 
kepti it is best to rub it with a little salt, if the 
weather be hot. 

For roasting the hind-quarter, it should hang 
as long as it will keep, but not so long as to 
tairit; putrid juices ought not to betaken mtb 
the stomach. 

Mutton for boiling will not look of a good 
colour if it has hunglong.

Leg of Mutton boiled, 

124. To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling,trim 
it as for roasting ; soak it for a couple of hours 
in cold water ; then put only water enough to 
cover it, and let it boil gently for three hours, or 
according to its weight. Some cooks boil it in 
a cloth; but if the water be afterwards wanted 
for soup, that should not be done ; some salt and 
an onion put into the water is far better. When 
nearly ready, take it from the fire, and, keeping 
the pot well covered, let it remain in the water 
for ten or fifteen minutes. 

The English taste being in favor of meat in 
which the gravy has been retained, this joint is 
esteemed to be in perfection when a little undc^r- 
done. It is sent to table with caper-sauce, No. 36, 
and mashed turnips. 

Neck of Mutton, 

126. Is particularly useful, as so many dishes 
may be made of it ; but it is not advantageous 
for the family. The bones should be cut short, 
which the butchers will not do unjess desired. 

The best end of the neck may be boiled, and 
served with turnips ; or roasted, or dressed in 
steaks, in pies, or harrico. 

The scrags may be stewed in broth . or with 
a small quantity of water, some small onions, a 
few pepper-corns, and a little rice, and served to- 
gether.

half-way down, and chop off the ends of the bones 
about four inches. The skin should not be taken 
off till boiled, and then the fat will look whiter. 
When there is more fat to a neck or loin of 
mutton, than it is agreeable to eat with the lean, 
it makes an uncommonly-good suet pudding, or 
crust for a meat pie, if cut very fine. 

Shoulder of Mutton roasted. 

126. Serve with onion sauce, No.lY. The blade- 
bone may be broiled. 

To dress a Haunch of Mutton 

127. Keep it as long as it can be preserved 
sweet by the different modes: let it be washed 
with warm milk and water, or vinegar, if neces- 
sary ; but when to be dressed, observe to wash 
it well, lest the outside should have a bad fla- 
vour from keeping. Put a paste of coarse flour 
on strong paper, and fold the haunch in : set it 
at a great distance from the fire, and allow pro- 
portionable time for the paste ; don't take it off 
till about thirty-five or forty minutes before 
serving, and then baste it continually. Bring 
the haunch nearer to the fire before you take off 
the paste, and froth it up as you would venison. 

A gravy must be made of a pound and a half 
of loin of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water 
to half, and no seasoning but salt; brown it 
with a little burnt sugal*, and send it up in the 
dish ; but there should be a good deal of gravy

To roast a saddle of Mutton. 

128. Let it be well kept first. Raise the skin, 
and then skewer it on again ; take itoffaqu^^rter 
of an hour before serving, sprinkle it with some 
salt, baste it, and dredge it well with flour. 
The rump should be split, and skewered back on 
each side. The joint may be large or small 
according to the company ; it is the most elegant 
if the latter. Being broad it requires a high and 
strong fire. 

Fillet of Mutton braised. 

129. Take off the chump end of the loin, butter 
some paper, and put over it, and then a paste 
as for venison ; roast it two hours. Don't let it 
be the least brown. Have ready some French 
beans boiled and drained on a sieve; and while 
the mutton is being glazed, give them one heat-up 
in gravy, and lay them on the dish with the meat 
over them. 

Harrico. 
180. Take off some of the fat, and cut the 
middle or best end of the neck into rather thin 
steaks ; flour and dry them in'their own fat of a 
fine light brown, but not enough for eating. 
Then put them into a dish while you fry the 
carrots, turnips, and onions; the carrots and 
turnips in dice, the onions sliced ; but they must 
only be warmed, not browned, or you need not 
fry them. Then lay the steaks at the bottom of

a stewpan, the vegetables over them, and pour 
as much boiling water as will just cover them- 
give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on 
the side of the fire to simmer gently till tender. 
Jn three or four hours skim them; and add 
pepper, salt and a spoonful of ketchup. 

To hash Mutton. 
131. Cut thin slices of dressed mutton, fat and 
lean ; flour them ; have ready a little onion 
boiled in two or three spoonfuls of water; add 
to It a little gravy and the meat seasoned, and 
make it hot, but not to boil. Serve in a covered 
dish. Instead of onion, a clove, a spoonful of 
currant-jelly, and half a glass of port wine will 
give an agreeable flavour of venison, if the meat 
be line. 

Breast of Mutton. 
132. Cut off the suprefluous fat, anr roast and 
serve the meat with stewed cucumbers ; or to 
eat cold covered with chopped parsley. Or half 
boil and then grill it before the fire ; in which 
case cover it with crumbs and herbs, and serve 
with caper-sauce, No. 35. Or if boned, take off 
a good deal of the fat, and cover it with bread 
herbs, and seasoning ; then roll and boil ; and 
serve with chopped walnuts,or capers and butter. 

Loin of Mutton^

sonae think it cuts better. Or for steaks, pies, 
or broth. ^ '

To roll Loin of Mutton, 



134. Hang the mutton till tender ; bone it ; and 
lay a seasoning of pepper, allspice, mace, nutmegs 
and a few cloves, all in fine powder,over it. Next 
day prepare a stuffing as for hare ; (see to roast 
hare) beat the meat, and cover it with the stuff- 
ing ; roll it up tight, and tie it. Half-bake it in a 
slow oven ; let it grow cold ; take off the fat, 
and put the gravy into a stewpan ; flour the 
meat, and put it in likewise ; stew it till almost 
ready ; and add a glass of port wine, some 
ketchup, an anchovy, and a little lemon-pickle, 
half an hour before serving ; serve it in the gravy, 
and with jelly-sauce. A few fresh mushrooms 
are a great improvement ; but if to eat like hare 
do not use these, nor the lemon-pickle. 

Mutton Ham. 

135. Choose a fine-grained leg of wether- 
mutton, of twelve or fourteen pounds weight ; 
let it be cut ham-shape, and hang two days. 
Then put into a stewpan half a pound of bay- 
salt, the same of common salt, two ounces of 
saltpetre, and half a pound of coarse sugar, all 
in powder ; mix and make it quite hot ; then rub 
it well into the ham. Let it be turned in the 
liquor every day ; at the end of four days put 
two ounces more cf common salt ; in twelve days 
take it out, dry it, and hang it up in wood-smoke 
a week. It is to be used in slices with stewed 
cabbago, mashed potatoes, or eggs.

To boil Shoulder oi Mutton with Oysters, 

186. Hang it some days, then salt it well for 
two days ; bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper 
and a bit of mace pounded : lay some oysters 
over it, and roll the meat up tight and tie it. 
Stew it in a small quantity of water, with an 
onion and a few pepper-corns, till quite tender. 

Have ready a little good gravy, and some 
oysters, stewed in it ; thicken this with flour and 
butter, and pour over the mutton when the tape 
is taken off. The stewpan should be kept close 
covered. 

Mutton Collops, 

137. Take a loin of mutton that has been well 
hune:; and cut from the part next the leg, some 
collops very thin. Take out the sinews. Season 
the collops with salt, pepper and mace ; then 
strew over them shred parsley, thyme, and two 
or three shalots : fry them in butter till half-done; 
add half a pint of gravy, a little juice of lemon, 
and a piece of butter rubbed in flour ; and 
simmer the whole ve^^y gently five minutes. They 
should be served immediately, or they will be 
hard. 

Mutton Steaks 

138. Should be cut from a loin or steak that 
has hung ; if a neck the bones should not be long. 
They should be broiled on a clear fire, seasoned 
when half-done, and often turned; take them 
up into a very hot dish, rub a bit of butter on 
each, and serve hot the moment they are done.

Mutton Sausages, 
139. Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg 
of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled ; 
chop it small, and season it with pepper, salt] 
mace, and nutmeg: add to it six ounces of beef 
suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a 
pint of oysters, all chopped very small ; a quarter 
of a pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy 
liquor, and the yolks and whites of two eggs well 
beaten. Put it all, when well mixed, into a little 
pot ; and use it by rolling it into balls or sausage 
shape and frying. If approved a little shalot may 
be added, or garlic, is a great improvement. 

To dress Mutton Rumps and Kidney, 
140. Stew six rumps in some good mutton- 
gravy half an hour ; then take them up, and let 
them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the 
fat; and put into it four ounces of boiled rice 
an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace • 
boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps 
with yolks of eggs well beaten ; and strew over 
them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, 
chopped parsley, and thyme, and grated lemon- 
peel. Fry in butter till a fine brown. While the 
rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put 
them to roast in an oven. When the rumps are 
fried, the grease must be drained before they are 
put on the dish, and the pan being cleared like- 
wise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the 
latter on the dish; th« rumps put round on the 
rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and

141. Half-fry, stew them, while hot, with 
herbs, crumbs, and seasoning ; put them in paper 
immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be 
careful the paper does not catch ; rub a bit of 
butter on it first to prevent that. 

An excellent Hotch-Potch, 

142. Stew peas, lettuce, and onions, in a very 
little water, with a beef or ham bone. While 
these are doing, fry some mutton or lamb steaks 
seasoned, of a nice brown ; three quarters of an 
hour before dinner, put the steaks into a stew- 
pan, and the vegetables over them ; stew them, 
and serve altogether in a tureen.

Lamh, 



[House-lamb is in season in March; grass-lamb comes in 
the end of May. Although preference is generally given to 
the former, both, nevertheless, are favourite dishes. Prime 
lamb should be at least four months old, and ought to weigh 
from thirty to forty pounds ; the fat should be white and 
clear in appearance, the flesh a pinkish white, smooth and 
firm to the touch. Second quality is not so well covered 
with fat, the flesh red, the meat softer, and the joints pre- 
sent a coarser appearance. Third quality is flabby, lean 
and red; the fat yellow. To ascertain if fresh, place the 
finger between the loin and kidney, if moist or tainted, do 
not purchase it.] 

Leg of Lamb 

145. Should be boiled in a cloth to look as white 
a8 possible. The loin fried in steaks and served 
round, garnished with dried or fried parsley; 
spinach to eat with it; or dressed separately, or 
roasted. 

Fore-quarter of Lamb. 

146. Roast it either whole, or in separate parts. 
If left to be cold, chopped parsley should be sprin 
kled over it. The neck and breast together ii 
called a scoven.

Leg, Breast, Scrag, and Head of Lamb. 

14'7. Put the joint into a saucepan, with one 
carrot, two turnips, one leek, cut in thick slices, 
thirty young button onions whole, three tea- 
spoonfuls of salt and one of pepper, cover with 
water, and set it on the fire, or in your oven for 
one hour ; at the end of one hour put in one pint 
of peas, a little green mint, and a tea-spoonful of

sugar ; set it by the side of the fire or in the oven 
for half an hour longer, and serve. This is for 
a leg or joint of five pounds weight ; for a larger 
one take a little longer time. A bunch of parsley 
and sweet-herbs may be added, but should be 
removed when served. The flavour is exquisite, 
and may be served with vegetables or without, 
as liked, but then the broth should be strained, 
and the vegetables served separate, or the broth 
made into spring or other soups. 

Breast of Lamb and Cucumbers, 
148. Cut off the chin-bone from the breast, and 
set it on to stew with a pint of gravy. When 
the bones would draw out, put it on the gridiron 
to grill; and then lay it in a dish on cucumbers 
nicely stewed. 

/ Shoulder of Lamb^ forced^ with Sorrel-sauce. 

149 Bone a shoulder of lamb, and fill it up 
with forcemeat : braise it two hours over a slow 
stove. Take it up, glaze it ; or it may be glazed 
only, and not braised. (The method for both see 
end of Part IV.) Serve with sorrel-sauce under 
the lamb. 

Lamb Steaks. 

160. Fry them of a beautiful brown ; when ser- 
ved, throw over them a good quantity of crumbs 
of bread fried, and crimped parsley. 

Mutton or lamb steaks, seasoned and broiled 
in buttered capers, either with crumbs and herbs, 
or without, are a genteel dish, and eat well. 
Serve with Sauce Robart, No 22.

powder, a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour • 
shake the steaks in this liquor, stir it, and let it

Roast Sweetbread, 

166. Boil sweetbreads, either heart or throat, 
trim them and dry them, then egg and bread 
crumb them ; brown them before the fire or in 
the oven; put good clear gravy under them, and 
water-cresses, as a garnish.

other, which will hold a small strip of bacon 
when put between them. Cut the pieces of bacon 
two or three inches long, and a quarter to half 
an inch square, put each one after the other in 
the pin, insert it in the meat, and leave only half 
an inch out ; eight pieces to each pound. 

To hraise, 

159. Is to put meat into a stew-pan, covered 
with fat bacon ; then add six or eight onions, a 
faggot of herbs, carrots if to be brown, celery, 
any bones, or trimmings of meat or fowls, and 
some stock (which you will find among soups and 
GRAVIES.) The bacon must be covered with a 
paper, and the lid of the pan must be put down 
close. Set it on a slow stove ; and, according to 
what it is, it will require two or three hours. 
The meat is then to be taken out ; and the gravy 
very nicely skimmed, and set on to boil very 
quick till it is thick. The meat is to be kept hot ; 
and if larded, put into the oven for a few minutes, 
and then put the jelly over it, which is called 
glazing, and is used for ham, tongue, and many 
made dishes. White wine is added to some gla- 
zing. The glaze should be of a beautiful clear 
yellow brown, and it is best to put it on with 
a nice brush. 

To clarify Butter for potted things 

160. Put it into a sauce-boat, and set that over 
the fire in a stew-pan that has a little water in. 
"When melted, take care not to pour the milky

PART V. 



POULTRY, EGGS AND GAME. 

[Fowls.— If a rooster is youm . s spurs will be short ; if 
fresh, the vent will be close and dark. Pullets are best 
just before they commence to lay ; their eombs and legs 
will be smooth ; if old hens, rough. A good capon has a 
thick belly and large rump ; there is a particular fat at his 
breast, the comb very pale. If a turkey-cock is young, it 
has a smooth black leg, with short spur ; the eye full and 
bright, if fresh, the feet supple and moist; if stale, the eye 
will be sunk and feet dry. The freshness of the hen is 
known by the same rules. The bill and feet of a young 
goose will be yellow, and but few hairs upon them ; if old 
they will be red : if fresh the feet will be pliable, if stale, 
dry and stiff. Green geese (till four months old) should 
be scalded ; a stubble goose picked dry. Choose ducks 
by the same rules ; they should be picked dry ; ducklings 
scalded. Pigeons should be very fresh; when they look 
flabby about the vent, and discoloured, they are stale ; the 
feet should be supple, if old, the feet are harsh. Wood- 
pigeon is large, and the flesh dark-coloured. Plovers are 
latest and best that feel hard at the vent ; in other respects 
choose by the same marks as other fowl ; there are three 
sorts, the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. 
Partridges are in season in autumn : if young, the bill is 
of a dark colour, the legs yellowish , if fresh, the vent will 
be firm, if stale, greenish. The cock pheasant is consi- 
dered best, except when the hen is with egg.] 

Directions for dressing Poultry and Game. 

All poultry should be carefully picked, every 
plug removed, and the hair singed with white 
paper. The cook must be careful in drawing 
poultry of all sorts, not to break the gall-bag, 
for no washing will take off the bitter where it

has touched. In dressing wild fowl, be careful 
to keep a brisk fire. 

Tame fowls require more roasting, and are 
longer in heating through than others. All kinds 
should be continually basted, that they may 
appear of a fine colour. A large fowl will take 
three quarters of an hour ; a middling one half 
an hour ; a chicken twenty minutes. A capon 
will take from half anlhour to thirty-five min- 
utes ; a goose, an hour; wild ducks, a quarter 
of an hour ; pheasants, twenty minutes ; a small 
turkey stuffed, an hour and a quarter ; grouse 
a quarter of an hour; quails, ten minutes ; and 
partridges, from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
A hare will take near an hour. 

Almost any kind of vegetables, such as carrots 
turnips, onions, potatoes, celery, or mushrooms 
maybe put raw in the pan and cooked under 
poultry, as well as cabbage, spinach, or greens 
previously boiled and chopped. ' 

To blanch Poultry and Game, 

1. Is to set it on the fire in a small quantitv 
of cold water and let it boil; as soon as it boils 
It IS to be taken out, and put into cold water for 
a few minutes. 

To boil Turkey, 

2. Make a stufiing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, 
nutmeg, lemon-peel, a few oysters or an anchovv 
a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg: put this 
into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boil the

Have ready oyster-sauce made with butter, a 
little cream, and a spoonful of soy, if approved, 
or No. 39; and pour it over the bird; or liver- 
sauce, No. 15. Hen-birds are best for boiling 
and should be young. 

To roast Turkey, 

3. The sinews of the legs should be drawn 
whichever way it is dressed. The head should 
be twisted under the wing; and in drawing it, 
take care not to tear the liver, nor let the eall 
touch it. 

Put a stuffing of sausage-meat ; or, if sausages 
are to be served in the dish, a bread stuffing. 
As this makes a large addition to the size of the 
bird, observe that the heat of the fire is constantly 
to that part ; for the breast is often not done 
enough. A little strip of paper should be put 
on the bone, to hinder it from scorching while 
the other parts roast. Baste well and froth it 
up. Serve with gravy in the dish, and plenty of 
bread-sauce in a sauce tureen. Add a few crumbs 
and a beaten egg to the stuffing of sausage-meat. 

Pulled Turkey. 

4. Divide the meat of the breast by pulling 
instead of cutting ; then warm it in a spoonful or 
two of white gravy, and a little cream, grated 
nutmeg, salt, and alittle flour and butter ; don't 
boil it. The leg should be seasoned, scored, and 
broiled, and put into the dish with the above 
round it. Cold chicken does as well.

To boil Fowl with Rice. 

6. Stew the fowl very slowly in some clear 
mutton broth woll skimmed ; and seasoned with 
onion, mace, pepper, and salt. About half an 
hour before it is ready, put in a quarter of a 
pint of rice well washed and soaked. Simmer 
till tender-; then strain it from the broth, and 
put the rice on a sieve before the fire. Keep the 
fowl hot, lay it in the middle of the dish, and

will be very nice to eat as such, but the less 
liquor the fowl is done with the better. Gravy 
or parsley and butter, for sauce.

113. Stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert- 
spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter, and pepper 
and salt ; let the other be unseasoned. Serve 
with a fine gravy. 

To boil Ducks. 

14. Choose a fine fat duck ; salt it two days, 
then boil it slowly in a cloth. Serve it with 
onion-sauce. No 11. (To stew ducks, see Stews.) 

To hash Ducks. 

15. Cut a cold duck into joints ; and warm it, 
without boiling, in gravy* and a glass of port 
win«. ^ 

To roast Goose. 

16. After it is picked, the plugs of the feathers 
pulled out, and the hairs singed, let it be well 
washed and dried, and a seasoning put in of onion,

When the breast is rising, take off the paper* 
and be careful to serve it before the breast falls* 
or It will be spoiled by coming flatted to table.' 
Let a good gravy be sent in the dish. Apple^ 
sauce, No. 21 ; gooseberry-sauce for a green goose 
(To stew giblets, see Stews.) 

Pigeons in jelly. 
17. Pick two very nice pigeons : and make them 
look as well as possible by singeing, washing, and 
cleaning the headd well.' Leave the heads and 
the feet on, but the nails must be clipped close 
to the claws. Roast them of a very nice brown ; 
and when done, put a little sprig of myrtle into 
the bill of each. Have ready a savory iellv 
and with it half fill a bowl of such a "size hs 
shall be proper to turn down on the dish you 
mean it to be served in. When the jelly and the 
birds are cold, see that no gravy hang to the 
birds, and then lay them upside d^ wn in the jelly. 
Before the rest of it begin to set, pour it over the 
birds, so as to be three inches above the feet. 
This should be done full twenty-four hours before 
serving. This dish has a very handsome appear- 
ance in the middle range of a second coursp. 
The head should be kept up as if alive, by tying 
the neck with some thread, and the legs bent as 
if the pigeon sat upon them. 

To pot Pigeons, 
18. Let them be quite fresh, clean them care- 
fully, and season them with salt and peppei : lay

them close in a deep paD. Cover them with 
butter, then take very thick paper tied down, 
and bake them. When cold, put them into pots 
that will hold two or three in each ; and pour 
butter over thern, using that which was baked 
as part. Observe that the butter should be 
pretty thick over them, if they are to be kept. 
If pigeons were boned, and then put in an oval 
form into the pot, they would lie closer, and 
require less butter. They may be stuffed with 
a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, <fec. and 
then they will eat excellently. If a high flavour 
is approved of, add mace, allspice, and a little 
Cayenne, before baking. Wild pigeons may be 
done this way. (To stew pigeons, see Stews.) 

Roast Pigeons, 

19. Should be stuffed with parsley, either cut 
or whole; and seasoned within. Serve with 
parsley and butter. Peas or asparagus should be 
dressed to eat with them. 

Pigeon Pudding. 

20. Pluck, draw, and stuff two pigeons with 
the veal stuffing, No. 78 ; cut some large thin 
slices of beef, and some of the bacon ; season 
well ; roll the pid^eons in the meat and bacon, lay 
them in the pudding ; boil four eggs hard, cut 
into quarters, and fill the cavities ; mix a tea- 
spoonful of flour with half a pint of milk, or 
water, close up, and boil for one hour and a half, 
and serve.

Grouse, 

40. Roast them like fowls, but the head is to 
be twisted under the wing. They must not be 
overdone. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish, 
and bread-sauce, or sauce No. 7. 

To roast Wild Fowl. 

41. The flavour is best preserved without 
stuffing. Put pepper, salt, and a piece of butter, 
into each. 

Wild fowl require much less dressing than 
tame ; they should be served of a fine colour, 
and well frothed :ip. A rich brown gravy 
should be sent in the dish; and when the breast 
is cut into slices, before taking off the bone, a 
squeeze of lemon, with pepper and salt, is a 
great improvement. 

It^ To take off the fishy taste which wild 
fowl sometimes have, put an onion, salt, and hot 
water, into the dripping pan, and baste them 
for the first ten minutes wit', this; then take 
away the pan, and baste constantly with butter. 

Guinea and Pea-Fowl 

42. Eat much like pheasants. Dress them in 
the same way, see No. 35. 

To Bone Birds. 

43. Begin to bone any birds by first taking 
out the breast-bone, when you will have sufficient 
space to remove the back with a sharp knife, and 
then the leg bones ; the skin must not be broken^ 
but the meat of the legs must be pushed inwards^

ally if you also nick the skin here and there 
with a small knife, to let it out. Serve with a 
line froth, rich gravy, melted butter, and currant 
jelly sauce ; the gravy in the dish. For stuffing 
use the liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a lit- 
tle suet, herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, a little 
onion, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it all 
The ears must be nicely cleaned and singed. 
They are reckoned a dainty. 

To jug an old Hare, 

2^ After cleaning, cut it up and season it 
with pepper, salt, allspice, pounded mace, and a 
little nutmeg. Put it into a jar with an onion, 
a clove or two, a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece 
of coarse beef, and the carcase bones over all. 
lie the jar down with a bladder or leather or 
strong paper ; and put it into a saucepan of 
water up to the neck. Keep the water boiling 
five hours. When it is to be served, boil the 
gravy up with a piece of butter and flour; and 
If the meat gets cold, warm it in this but not to 
boil. 

Broiled and hashed Hare, 
3. The flavour of broiled hare is particularly 
tine, the legs or wings must be seasoned first : 
rub with cold butter, and serve hot.— The other 
parts warmed with gravy and a little stuffing 
may be seryed separately.

Cut the skin off the neck and head ; take care to

out the liver, lights, <fec., and be sure to draw the 
gut out of the vent. Cut the sinews, that lie 
under the hind legs, bring them up to the fore 
lege, put a skewer through the hind leg, then 
through the fore leg under the joint, run it 
through the body, and do the same on the other 
side. Put another skewer through the thick 
part of hind legs and body, put the head between 
the shoulders, and run a skewer through, to keep 
it in its place. Put a skewer in each ear to make 
them stand erect, and tie a string round the 
middle of the body over the legs, to keep them 
m their place. A young fawn must be trussed 
just in the same manner, except that the ears 
must be cut off.

same manner ; they should always be boiled by 
themselves. Should the cabbage be left, it may 
be chopped, put into a saucepan with a lump of 
butter, and pepper and salt, and made hot, and 
sent to table. 

To stew old Peas. 
23. Soak them in water all night, if not fine 
boilers; otherwise only half an hour ; put them 
mto water enough just to cover them, with a 
good bit of butter, or a piece of beef or pork. 
Stew them very gently till the peas are soft, and 
the meat is tender ; if it is not salt meat, add 
salt and a little pepper. Serve them round the 
meat. 

Stewed Beans,

butter has been placed— preserve them as white 
as you can—chop a few sweet herbs with some 
parsley very fine, stew them in a pint of the

To boil Potatoes. 
^ 21 Set them on a fire, without pareinff them,

some salt in, and a pint of cold water, and let 
tiiem boil again till almost done. Pour off the 
water, and put a clean cloth over them, and then 
the saucepan-cover, and set them by the fire to

Potatoes look best when the skin is peeled, not 
cut. * ' 

Do new potatoes the same, but be careful thev 
are taken off in time, or they will be watery. 
Before dressing,rub off the skin with a cloth, and 
salt, and then wash. 

To mash Potatoes,

Potato Balls, 



30. Mash some floury potatoes quite smooth, 
season with pepper and salt, add fresh butter 
until sufficiently moist, but not too much so ; 
make mto balls, roll them in vermicelli crumbled,' 
or bread crumbs ; in the latter case they may be 
brushed with the yolk of egg—fry them a nice 
brown. Serve them on a napkin, or round a 
dish of mashed potatoes which has not been 
moulded. 

To broil Potatoes, 

31. Parboil, then slice and broil them. Or par- 
boil, and then set them whole on the gridiron 
over a very slow fire, and when thoroughly done 
send them up with their skins on. This last way 
is practised in many Irish families. 

Carrots 

32. Require a good deal of boiling. When 
young, wipe off the skin when half boiled; when 
old, boil them with the salt meat, but scrape them 
first. 

To boil Squash. 

33. The summer squash is much better when 
the rind begins to turn yellow— it is then less 
watery and insipid than when younger. Cut 
them in pieces, take out the seeds, boil them till 
tender—they will take about three-quarters of 
an hour; when done, drain well, till you have 
got out all the water— mash them with a little 
butter, pepper and salt.

Beet-Root 
89. Makes a very pleasant addition to winter- 
salad, of which they may agreeably form a full 
half. This root is cooling, and very wholesome. 
It IS extremely good boiled, and sliced with a 
small quantity of onion ;or stewed with whole 
onions, large or small, as follows:-— 
^ Boil the beet tender with the skin on, slice it 
into a stewpan with a little broth, and a spoon- 
ful of vinegar ; simmer till the gravy is tinged 
with the color, then put it into a small dish, and 
make a round of the button-onions, first boiled 
till tender; take off the skin just before serving, 
and mind they are quite hot and clear. If beet- 
root is in the least broken before dressed it parts 
with its color, and looks ill. 

To bake Egg-plant. 
40. The purple plant is considered the best. 
Put them whole into your stew-pan, with plenty 
of boiling water, and simmer till quite tender ; 
drain, peal and mash them smooth—mix them 
with some bread crumbs, powdered, sweet mar- 
joram, and some butter, a few pounded cloves, 
grate some bread over the top, and put in your 
oven to brown ; serve in the same dish.

Mushrooms, 



[The cook should be well acquainted with the different 
^Z \ ^^}^^^^^ called by this name by ignorant people, as 
the death of many persons has been occasioned by the use 
or poisonous kinds. The eatable mushrooms first appear 
small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow 
very fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As the 
size increases the under part gradually opens, and shows 
a fringy fur of a very fine salmon-color, which continues 
more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and 

*f ^ }^l^^ ^"^ ^ ^^^^^ brown. These marks should be 
attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily 
parted from the edges and middle. Those that have a 
white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, though 
many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as 
the right sort. Put in a small onion with the mushroome, 
that you may know by its turning almost black, whether 
there is a poisonous one among them. If the onion turns 
black throw away all the mushrooms.] 

Mushrooms Toasted. 

61. First cut two good slices of bread, half an 
inch thick, large enough to cover the bottom of 
a plate, toast them, and spread some cream over 
the toast. Remove all the earthy part 
from the mushroom, and lay them gently on the 
toast, head downwards, slightly sprinkle them 
with salt and pepper, and place in each a little 
cream; then put a tumbler over each and place 
them on a stand before the fii'e, and keep turn- 
ing them so as to prevent the glass breaking, and 
in ten to fifteen minutes the glass will fill with 
vapour, which is the essence of the mushroom ; 
when it is taken up, do not remove the glass for 
a few minutes, by which time the vapour will 
have become condensed and gone into the bread,

but when It IS the aroma is so powerful as to 
pervade the whole apartment. The sight, when 
the glass IS removed, is most inviting, aid the 
taste IS worthy of Lucullus. In the absence of 
cream, use butter, or boil some milk till reduced 
to cream with a little salt, pepper, and one 
clove ; when warm put in an ounce of butter, 
mixed with a little flour, stir round, put the 
mushroom on the toast with this sauce, cover 
with a basin, and place in the oven for half an 
hour. In this way all kinds of mushrooms will 
be excellent. They may be put into baking 
pans : cover with a tumbler as above, and bake 
in oven. — Soter. 

To stew Mushrooms, 
62. The large buttons are best, and the small 
flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the lar^e 
buttons with salt and a bit of flannel, cut out the 
fur, and take off the skin from the others. 
Sprinkle them with salt, and put into a stewpan 
with some pepper-corns ; simmer slowly till done 
then put a small bit of butter and flour, and two 
spoonfuls of cream ; give them one boil, and serve 
with sippets of bread.

mushrooms, drain them, and stew them with

they are done, stir into the sauce the yolks of two 
or three eggs, and some cream. Toast and butter '

54. Peel a pint of mushrooms, cut them up. 
and put them in a pan with as much coJd water 
as will keep them from burning, [m- Throw 
in with them a small onion to test their goodness, 
as, If there is a bad or poisonous one among them 
the onion will turn of a blueish-black while cook- 
ing. In that case, throw them all away.l Stew 
them slowly till they have lost all shipe and 
have become an undistinguishable mass. Then 
strain them. Put into a stew-^an a large piece

9. Take some of the middle, or scrag, of a 
small neck ; season it ; and either put to it,^ or 
not, a few slices of lean bacon or ham. If it is 
wanted of a high relish, add mace, Cayenne, and 
nutmeg, to the salt and pepper ; also forcemeat 
and eggs; and if you choose, add truffles, morels, 
mushrooms, sweetbreads cut into small bits. 
Have a rich gravy readj , to pour in after baking. 
It will be very good without any of the latter 
additions. 

J[ richer Veal Pie. 

10. Cut steaks from a knuckle of veal ; season 
them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a very little 
clove in powder; slice two sweetbreads, and 
season them in the same manner ; lay a pufF paste 
on the ledge of the dish ; then put the meat, yolks 
of hard eggs, the sweetbreads, and some oysters, 
up to the top of the dish ; lay over the whole 
some very thin slices of ham, and half fill the dish 
with stock made from the bones; cover, and,

as it can possibly hold, and do not cut it till cold ; 
then fiist cut out a large bit, going down to the 
bottom ot the dish ; and when done thus, thinner 
slices can be cut; the different colours, and the 
clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled appearance. 

A small pie may be made to eat hot, which 
with high seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, 
morels, (fee, have a very good appearance. 

The cold pie will keep many days. Slices 
make a pretty side dish. 

Instead of isinglass, use a calf's foot, or a cow- 
heel, if the jelly is not likeh- to be stiff enough. 

14. Another. — Well soak half a calf's head, and 
boil half an hour, the tongue longer ; then cut 
the meat in pieces ; stew the bones with a little 
mace, white pepper, or anything that will make 
it good without colouring the liquor; place at 
the bottom of the dish sonieparsley, ham, tongue^ 
and pieces of boiled eg^^ then put some slices of 
the brain3. which should be boiled rather hard : 
add salt, and about two spoonfuls of water, and 
cover with shoi't crust. The liquor the bones 
are boiled in should be reduced till it is strong 
and of a nice flavor; strain it, and while the pie 
is hot pour as much in as the dish will hold ; let 
it stand all night, and when wanted turn it out 
upside down, with parsley round. 

Medley Pie. 

16. Cut slices of beef, mutton, or pork with 
bacon (or use bacon alone) ; lay them in a dish

cover it over, pinching the edge. When they 
come out, pour into each a spoonful of gravy 
made of a bit of mutton. 

Lamb Pie, 

19. Make it of the loin, neck, or breast: the 
breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate 
things that can be eaten. It should be very 
lightly seasoned with pepper and salt ; the bone 
taken out, but not the gristles; and a small 
quantity of jelly-gravy be put in hot; but the 
pie should not be cut till cold. Put two spoon- 
fuls of water before baking. 

Grass lamb makes an excellent pie, and may 
either be boned or not, but not to bone it is per- 
haps the best. Season with only pepper and 
salt ; put two spoonfuls of water before baking, 
and as much gravy when it comes from the oven. 

Note. — Meat pies being fat, it is best to let out the gravy 
on one side, and put it in again with a funnel, at the 
centre, when little or much may be added. 

Chicken Pie, 

20. Cut up two young fowls ; season with 
white pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all 
in the finest powder ; likewise a little Cayenne. 
Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammon 
of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by 
turns in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish, 
put a little water; but none if in a raised crust. 
By the time it is done, have ready a gravy of 
thuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag with some 
shankbones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion,

mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot 
you may add truffles, morels, mushrooms, &q ' 
but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a 
dish put as much gravy as will fill it; but in 
raised crust, the gravy must be nicely strained 
and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelH- 
clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of 
two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then 
run it through a fine lawn sieve. 

Rabbits, if young and in flesh, do as well; 
their legs should be cut short, and the breast- 
bones must not go in, but will help to make the 
gravy. 

Green-goose Pie, 

21. Bone two young green geese, bui first take 
away every plug, a;ad singe them nicely. Wash 
them clean ; and season them high with salt 
pepper, mace, and allspice. Put one inside the 
other ; press them as close as vou can, drawing 
the legs inwards. Put a good deal of butter over 
theni, and bake them either with or without 
crust ; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit 
close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. 

Buck Pie. 
22. Bone a full-grown young duck and a fowl • 
wash them, and season with pepper and salt, and 
a small proportion of mace and allspice, m the 
finest powder. Put the fowl within the duck 
and in the iormer a calfs tongue pickled red' 
boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole 
close ; the skins of the legs should be drawn

inwards that the body of the fowl may be quite 
smooth. If approved, the space between the 
sides of the crust may be filled with a fine force- 
meat, made according to the receipt given for 
making forcemeat in page 59. Bake it in a slow 
oven, either in a raised crust, or pie-dish with a 
thick crust, ornamented. 

The large pies are made as above ; but with a 
goose outwards, then a turkey, a duck next, then 
a fowl ; and either tongue, small birds, or force- 
meat in the middle. 

23. Another.-^MLsike a puff-paste crust; then 
scald two ducks, and make them clean ; cut off 
the feet, the pinions, the neck, and head, picked 
and scalded with the gizzards, livers and hearts : 
pick out all the fat of the inside ; lay a crust 
over the dish, season the ducks with pepper and 
salt, inside and out, lay them in the dish, and 
the giblets at each end, seasoned ; put in as much 
water as will almost fill the pie, lay on the crust, 
and bake it, but not too much. 

Venison Pasty. 

24. A shoulder boned mak'^s a good pasty, but 
it must be beaten and seasoned, and the want of 
fat supplied by that of a fine well-hung loin of 
mutton, steeped twenty-four hours in equal parts 
of rape, vinegar, and port. The shoulder being 
sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well 
with sugar for two or three days, and when to 
be used wipe it perfectly clean from it and the 
wine.

When ham is used for gravy or pies, take the

You may add sliced onions. Cover with a crust.

ped parsley or eschalot, a small piece of winter

ing. The same paste will do for fruit pies, with 
grated lemon or orange-peel, instead of herbs. 

Raised crust for Meat Pies^ or Fowls, 8fc, 

36. Boil water with a little fine lard, and an 
equal quantity of fresh drippiug, or of butter, 
but not much of either. While hot, mix this 
with as much flour as you will want, making the 
paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which you 
will make it by good kneflding and beating it 
with the rollirj'gpin. When quite smooth, put 
in a lump into a cloth, or under a pan, to soak 
till near cold. Those who have not a good hand 
at raising crust may roll the paste of a proper 
thickness, and cat out the top and bottom of the 
pie, then a long piece for the sides. Cement the 
bottom to;the sides with egg, bringing the former 
rather further out, and pinching both together ; 
put egg between the edges of the paste, to make 
it adhere at the sides. Fill your pie, and put on 
the cover, and pinch it and the side crust 
together. The same mode of uniting the paste ia 
to be observed if the sides are pressed into a tin 
form, in which the paste must be baked, after it 
shall be filled and covered ; but in the latter 
case, the tin should be buttered, and carefully 
taken off when done enough ; and as the form 
usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is 
proper, the paste should be put into the oven 
again for a quarter of an hour. Put egg over at 
first with a feather.

Yeast, or Suffolk Dumplings. 

58. Make a very light dough with yeast, as 
tor bread, but with milk instead of water, and 
put salt. Let it i ise an hour before the fire. 

Twenty minutes before you are to serve, have 
ready a large stewpan of boiling water ; make 
the dough into balls, the size of a middling apple ; 
throw them in, and boil twenty minutes. If you 
doubt when done enough, stick a clean fork into 
one, and if it come out clear, it is done. 

The way to eat them is to tear them apart on 
the top with two forks, for they become heavy 
by their own steam. Eat imr ^diately with 
meat, or sugar and butter, or salt. 

Common Pancakes. 

69. Make a light batter of eggs, flour and 
milk. Fry in a small pan, in hot dripping or 
lard. Salt or nutmeg, and ginger, may be added. 

Sugar and lemon should be served to eat with 
them. Or, when eggs are scarce, make the 
batter with flour and small beer, ginger, (fee. ; or 
clean snow, with flour, and a very little m'ilk, 
will serve as well as e^g.

strained, with a pint ot cream, four ounces of 
sugar, a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, and 
as much flour as will make it almost as thick as 
ordinary pancake batter, but not quite. Heat 
the fryingpan tolerably hot, wipe it cli an, then 
pour in the batter, to make thin pancakes. 

Irish Pancakes, 

■ 62. Beat eight yolks and four whites of eggs, 
strain them into a pint of cream, put a grated 
nutmeg, and sugar to your taste ;set three ounces 
of fresU butter on the fire, stir it, and as it warms 
pour it to the cream, which should be warm 
when the eggs are put to it: then mix smooth 
almost half a pint of flour. Fry the pancakes 
very thin ; the first with a bit of butter, but not 
the others. Serve several on one another. 

New-England Pancakes. 

63. Mix a pint of cream, five spoonfuls of fine 
flour, seven yolks and four whites of eggs, and a 
very little salt; fry them very thin in fresh 
butter, and between each strew sugar and cinna- 
mon. Send up six or eight at once.

at least. It will be extremely light. Put a 
good quantity of fine lard in a stewpan, and 
drop a spoonful of the batter at a time into it. 
Fry them ; and serve as a sauce, a glass of white 
wme, the juice of a lemon, one dessert-spoonful 
of peach-leaf or almond-water, and some suear 
warmed together. °

PASTRY. 231 



PART X. 

PASTRY. 

[Pastry is best when rolled on marble, or on a large slate. 
A good pastry cook never leaves any of the paste adhere- 
ing to the board or dish, used in making it. In very hot 
weather, butter should be put into cold water to keep it 
as firm as possible ; and if made early in the morning, and 
preserved from the air until it is to be baked, the cook 
will find it much better. A good hand at making pastry 
will use much less butter, and produce lighter crust than 
others. Salt butter, if very good, and well washed, makei 
a fine flaky crust. Preserved fruits should not be baked 
long ; those that have been done with their full proportion 
of sugar, need no baking ; the crust should be baked in & 
tin shape, and the fruit be afterwards added ; or it may be 
put into a small dish, or tart-pans, and the covers bo 
naked on a tin cut out according to taste.] 

Rich Fuff Paste, 

1. Puffs may be made of any sort of fruit, but 
it should be prepared first with sugar. 

Weigh an equal quantity of butter with as 
much fine flour as you judge necessary; mix a 
little of the former with the latter, and wet it 
with as little water as will make into a stiff 
paste. Roll it out, and put all the butter over it 
in slices, turn in the ends, and roll it thin ; do 
this twice, and touch it no more than can be 
avoided. The butter may be added in twice ; 
and to those who are not accustomed to make 
paste it may be better to do so. A quicker oven 
than for short crust is required.

^ less rich Paste, 

2. Weigh a pound of flour, and a quarter of 
a pound of butter, rub them together, and mix 
into a paste with a little water, and an egg well 
beaten-— of the former as little as will suffice, or 
the paste will be tough. Roll, and fold it three 
or four times. 

^ Rub extremely fine in one pound of dried flour, 
six ounces of butter, and a spoonful of white 
sugar ; work up the whole into a stiff paste with 
as little hot water as possible. 

Crust for Venison Pasty, 

3. To a quarter of a peck of fine flour use two 
pounds and a half of butter, and four eggs ; mix 
into paste with warm water, and work it smooth 
and to a good consistence. Put a paste round 
the inside, but not to the bottom of the dish, and 
let the cover be pretty thick, to bear the long 
continuance in the oven. 

Mice Paste for Sweets, 

4. Boil a quarter of a pound of ground rice 
in the smallest quantity of water ; strain from it 
all the moisture as well as you can ; beat it in a 
mortar with half an ounce of butter, and one 
egg well beaten, and it will make an excellent 
paste for tarts, <fcc.

chops into a dish, and cover it with the rice ; by 
the addition of an egg the rice will adhere better. 
Rabbits fricasseed, and covered thus, are very 
good. 

Potato Paste. 

6. Pound boiled potatoes very fine, and add, 
while warm, a sufficiency of butter to make the 
mash hold together, or yon may mix with it an 
egg ; then before it gets cold, flour the board 
pretty well to prevent it from sticking, and roll 
it to the thickness wanted. 

If it is become quite cold before it be put on 
the dish, it will be apt to crack. 

Raised Crust for Custards or Fruit, 

7. Put four ounces of butter into a saucepan 
with water, and when it boils, pour it into as 
much flour as you choose ; knead and beat it till 
smooth ; cover it, as in page 209. Raise it ; and 
if for custard, put a paper within :o keep out the 
sides till half done, then fill with a cold mixture 
of milk, egg, sugar, and a little peach-water, 
lemon-peel, or nutmeg. By cold is meant that 
the egg is not to be warmed, but the milk should 
be warmed by itself — not to spoil the crust. 

The above butter will make a great deal of 
raised crust, which must not be rich, or it will 
be difficult to prevent the sides from falling. 

Excellent short Crusts. 

8. Take two ounces of white sugar, pounded 
and sifted, quite dry ; then mix it with a pound

of flour well dried ; rub into it three ounces of 
butter so fine as not to be seen — put into some 
cream the yolks of two eggs, beaten, and mix the 
above into a smooth paste; roll it thin, and bake 
it in a moderate oven. 

9. Another. -^Mix with a pound of fine flour 
dried, an ounce of sugar pounded and sifted ; 
then crumble three ounces of butter in it, till it 
looks all like flour, and with a gill of boiling 
cream, work it up to a fine paste. 

10. Another, not sweet, but rich, — Rub six 
ounces of butter in eight ounces of fine flour; 
mix into a stiffish paste, with as little water as 
possible; beat it well, and roll it thin. This, as 
well as the former, is proper for tarts of fresh or 
preserved fruits. Bake in a moderate oven.

11. Dry a pound of the best flour, mix with it 
three ounces of refined sugar ; then work half a 
pound of butter with your hand til] it comes to 
froth ; put the flour into it by degrees, and work 
into it, well beaten and strained, the yolks of 
three, and whites of two eggs. If too limber, 
put some flour and sugar to make it fit to roll. 
Line your pattypans, and fill. Fifteen minutes 
will bake them. Against they come out, have 
ready some refined sugar, beat up with the white 
of an egg, as thick as you can ; ice them all over, 
set them in the oven to harden, and serve cold.

dish, a paste being put round the edge; when 
one layer is in, sprinkle half the sugar, and 
shred lemon-peel, and squeeze some juice, or a 
glass of cider if the apples have lost their spirit ; 
put in the rest of the apples, sugar, and the 
liquor that you have boiled. Cover with paste. 
You may add some butter when cut, if eaten hot ; 
or put quince-marmalade, orange-paste, or cloves'

Venison Pasty. 

43. A shoulder boned makes a good pasty, but 
it must be beaten and seasoned, and the want of 
fat supplied by that of a fine well-hun^ loin 
of mutton, steeped twenty^four hours in equal 
parts of rape, vinegar, and port. 

The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advan- 
tage to rub it well with sugar for two or three 
days, and when to be used wipe it perfectly clean 
from It and the wine. Three or four hours in a 
slow oven will be sufficient to make it tender 
and the flavour will be preserved. Either in a 
shoulder or side, the meat must be cut in pieces 
and laid with fat between, that it may be pro' 
portioned to each person, without breaking up 
the pasty to find it. Lay some pepper and salt 
at the bottom of the dish, and some butter. 

The venison bones should be boiled with some 
fine old mutton— of this gravy put half a pint, 
cold, into the dish ; then lay butter on the veni- 
son, and cover as well as line the side with a 
thick crust, but don't put one under the meat 
Keep the remainder of the gravy till the pastv 
IS taken from the oven; put it into the middfe 
by a funnel, hot, and shake the dish to mix well. 

Potato Pasty, 
44. Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as 
possible ; mix them with salt, pepper, and a 
good bit of butter. Make a paste ; roll it out 
thin like a large puff", and put in the potato ; 
fold over one half, pinching the edges. Bake in 
a moderate oven.

Cfieap and excellent Custard. 

45. Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of 
lemon-peel, a bit of cinnamon and sweeten it. 
Meanwhile rub down smooth a large spoonful of 
rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix with 
it two yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a bapin 
of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold, and 
then pour that to the boiling ; stirring it one 
way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to 
boil up ; then pour it into a pan, stir it some 
time, add a large spoonful of peach-water, two 
tea-spoonfuls of brandy, or a little ratafia. 
Marbles boiled in custard, or any thing likely to 
burn, will, by shaking them in the saucepan, 
prevent it from catching. 

Richer Custard, 

46. Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel and 
cinnamon ; mix a pint of cream, and the yolks 
of five eggs well beaten ; when the milk tastes 
of the seasoning, sweeten it enough for the 
whole ; pour it into the cream, stirring it well; 
then gv7e the custard a simmer till of a proper 
thickness. Don*t let it boil ; stir the whole time 
one way ; season as above. If to be very rich, 
put no milk, but a quart of cream to the eggs. 

Baked Custard. 

47. Boil one pint of cream, half a pint of milk ; 
with mac€, cinnamon, and lemon-peel, a little of 
each. "When cold, mix the yolks of three eggs ; 
sweeten them and make your cups or paste nearly 
full. Bake them ten minutes.

till thick enough ; then add a large glass of rich 
wine, and half a glass of brandy ; give the whole 
one scald, and put it in cups, to be eaten cold. 

• Almond Custard. 
49. Blanch and beat four ounces of almonds 
line with a spoonful of water; beat a pint of 
cream with two spoonfuls of rose- water, and put 
them to the yolks of four eggs, and as much 
sugar as will make it pretty sweet ; then add 
the almonds ; stir it all over a slow fire till it is 
of a proper thickness ; but don't boil. Pour it 
into cups. 

Cheesecakes. 
60. Strain the whey from the curd of two 
quarts of milk; when rather dry, crumble it 
through a coarse sieve, and mix with six ounces 
of fresh butter, one ounce of pounded blanched 
a monds, a little orange-flower water, half a 
glass of raisin wine, a grated biscuit, four ounces 
ot currants, some nutmeg, and cinnamon, in fine 
powder and beat all the above with three eggs

or good milk, and add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, 
and three ounces of currants. 

Lemon Cheesecakes, 

52. Mix four ounces of sifted lump-sugar, and 
four ounces of butter, and gently melt it ; then 
add the yolks of two and the white of one egg, 
the rind of thiee lemons shred fine, and the juice 
of one and a half; one Savoy biscuit, some 
blanched almonds pounded, three spoonfuls of 
brandy; mix well, and put in paste made as 
follows : eight ounces of flour, six ounces of but- 
ter, two-thirds of which mix with the flour first, 
then wet it with six spoonfuls of water, and roll 
the remainder in. 

53. Another way, — Boil two large lemons, or 
three small odcs, and after squeezing, pound 
them well together in a mortar, with four ounces 
of loaf-sugar, the yolks of six eggs, and eight 
ounces of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans 
half full. 

Orange cheesecakes are done the same way, 
oi!ly you must boil the peel in two or three 
waters to take out the bitterness, or make them 
of orange marmalade well beaten in a mortar. 

Potato Cheesecakes, 

54. Boil six ounces of potatoes, and four ounces 
of lemon-peel ; beat the latter in a marble mortar

reduce to powder, and sift it with as much more 
as will make one pound. Mix it with one pound 
of flour, four well-beaten eggs, and six ounces of 
warm butter. Drop the mixture on buttered 
tins, and bake in a very slow oven, for twenty 
or thirty minutes. Should look pale, but be 
perfectly crisp.

spoonful of raspberry-jam, two whites of eggs, 
juice of one lemon ; beat for half an hour. Serve 
up sprinkled with fancy biscuits. 

Royal Paste, called " Au Choux,** 

66. This paste is the basis of many sorts of 
pastry ; it is used to mix an infinite number of 
second-course dishes of various forms, and of 
different denominations. 

Take a stewpan large enough to contain four 
quarts of water, pour half a pint of water into it, 
with a quarter of a pound or a little more of 
fresh butter, two ounces of sugar, a little salt, 
and the peel of a lemon ; let the whole boil till 
the butter is entirely melted. Then take some 
very fine dry flour and shake it through a sieve. 
Take the lemon-peel out with a ladle, and throw 
a handful of flour into the preparation while 
boiling ; take care, however, not to put more 
flour than the liquor can soak up. Stir with a 
wooden spoon till the paste can easily be detached 
from the stewpan, and then take it off the fire. 
Next break an egg into this paste, and mix it 
well ; then break a second, which also mix ; do 
not put more eggs than the paste can absorb, 
but you must be careful not to make this pre- 
paration too liquid. It is almost certain, that 
about five or six eggs will be wanted for the 
above quantity ; then form them en chouXj by

Circumference. As this paste swells very much 

you must dress it accordinprly, putting the choux 

^° » ^aKjng ^heet, at an inch distant' from each 

other. Brush them over as usual with egs; wash 

to which has been added a little milk. Put 

them into an oven moderately hot, but do not 

open the oven till they are quite baked, other- 

wise they would flatten, and all attempts to 

make them rise again would be useless ; next 

dry them. Sometimes you may glaze them ; at 

other times you may send them up without being 

glazed. To detach them from the baking sheet, 

apply the sharp edge of your knife, and take 

them off gently. Then make a small opening on 

the side, into which put, with a tea-spoon, such 

sweetmeats as you think proper, and send them

Soyer^s Apple Cake, 
66. Butter a pie-dish near a quarter of an inch 
thick, throw in a large quantity of bread-crumbs 
as much as will stick, when pressed well, on the 
butter; then have some apples already stewed 
down and sweetened, of which nearly fill the 
dish, put one ounce of butter in bits, cover over 
with bread-crumbs, also half an inch thick put 
into hot oven; when done, pass a knife round 
and turn it out, sugar over, and glaze with a red 
hot shovel. If used hot, a little rum put round 
It and lighted is very nice.

PART XI. 



CAKES, BREAD, &c. 



[After currants are nicely washed, they should be dried 
in a cloth, and set before the fire. If damp, they will 
make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are added, a 
dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and 
shaken, which causes the thing they are put with, to be 
lighter. Eggs should be long beaten, whites and yolks 
apart, and always strained. Sugar should be powdered 
on a board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn- 
sieve. Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and with 
a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar to a paste, then 
mixed with a little wine or cream, so as to divide easily 
among the other ingredients. After all the articles are put 
into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, 
as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being 
well incorporated. Whether black or white plum-cakes, 
they require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat 
equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, 
milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is 
less easily divided than if the butter be first put with those 
ingredients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the 
fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, 
especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the 
batter will not rise. Should you fear i ts catchmg by being 
too quick, put some paper over the cake to prevent its 
being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body 
of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To 
know when it is soaked, take a bright knife and plunge 
into the centre, draw it out, and if the least stickiness 
adheres, put the cake Immediately in, and shut up the 
oven. If theheat issumcient to raise, but not to soak, 
get fresh fuel quickly put m, and keep the cakes hot till 
the oven is fit to finish the soaking.]

a pound of butter, withhalf a pint of milk ; when 
just warm, put to it a quarter of a pint of yeast, 
and work up to a good dough. Let it stand before 
the fire a few minutes before putting it into the 
oven ; add seeds, or currants, and bake an hour 
and a half. 

11. Another, — Mix a pound and a half of flour, 
and a pound of common lump-sugar, eight eggs 
beaten separately, an ounce of seeds, two spoon- 
fuls of yeast, and the same of milk and water. 

Note.— Milk alone causes cake and bread soon to dry. 

Common Bread Cake, 

12. Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from 
the dough, when making white bread, and knead 
well into it two ounces of butter, two of sugar, 
and eight of currants. Warm the butter in a 
tea-cupful of good milk. 

By the addition of an ounce of butter, or sugar, 
or an egg or two, you may make the cake better. 
A tea-cupful of raw cream improves it much. It 
is best to bake it in a pan^ rather than as a loaf, 
the outside being less hard.

of flour, four ounces of sugar, a nutmeg, or not, 
as you like, a few Jamaica peppers, a dessert- 
spoonlul of carraways; put a spoonful or two of 
cream into a cup of yeast, and as much good 
milk as will make the above into a light paste. 
Set it to rise by a fire till the oven be ready. 
Bake on tins. 

Richer Buns, 

29. Mix one pound and a half of dried flour

ginger, the same of allspice and cinnamon, in 
powder; the rind of one lemon grated, and as 
much treacle as will make it in a paste to spread 
on tins very thin. Take it gently when hot, cut 
it in squares, and, while warm, roll it over a 
round stick. Keep in a dry place. 

Note.— Cakes or biscuits if kept in paper, or in a draw- 
er will taste disagreeable. A pan and cover, or tureen, 
will preserve them long and moist. Or, if to be crisp, 
laying them before the fire will make them so. 

To make Yeast, 

38. Boil one pound of potatoes to a mash; 
when half cold, add a cupful of yeast, and mix it 
welL It will be ready for use in two or three 
hours, and keeps well. 

Use double the quantity of this to what you do

make a very light paste, rather like a batter, and 

let it ris^ before the fire half an hour; then add 

some more flour, to make it a little stifFer, but 

not stiff. Work it well, and divide it into small 

loaves, or cakes, five or six inches wide, and 

flatten them. When baked and cold, slice them 

the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to 

brown a little. 

Note. — The cakes, when first baked, eat deliciously but- 
tered for tea ; or with carraways, to eat cold. 

To make Bread. 

35. To four pounds of flour, add four spoonfuls 
of yeast ; a pint of water, a little salt ; make it 
into a stiff paste, set it by the fire to rise for 
two hours, knead it well and make it into loaves 
and bake in oven with a good steady heat. 

The Reverend Mr. Haggefs economical Bread, 

36. Only the coarse flake-bran is to be removed 
from the flour ; of this take five pounds, and boil 
it in rather more than four gallons of water ; so 
that when ])erfectly smooth, you may have three 
gallons and three quarts of bran-water clear. 
With this, knead fifty-six pounds of the flour, 
adding salt and yeast in the same way, and pro- 
portions as for other bread. When ready to bake, 
divide into loaves, bake two hours and a half. 

Thus made, flour will imbibe three quarts more 
of bran-water than of plain ; so that it not only 
produces a more nutritious substantial food, but 
makes an increase of one-fifth of the usual quan- 
tity of bread. When ten days old, if put into

Rice-and-Wheat Bread. 

37. Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of 
water till it becomes perfectly soft ; Avhen it is 
of a proper warmth, nJx it well with four pounds 
of flour, and yeast and salt as for other bread ; 
of yeast about four large spoonfuls; knead it 
well ; then set it to rise before the fire. Some of 
the flour should be reserved to make up the 
loaves If the rice should require more 
water, it must be added, as some rice swells more 

than other. 

French Bread. 

38. With a quarter of a peck of fine flour mix 
the yolks of three and whites ol two eggs, beaten 
andstraineJ, a little salt, half a pint of good 
yeast that is not bitter, and as much milk, made 
a little warm, as will work into a thin light 
dough. Stir it about, but don't knead it. Have 
ready three dishes, divide the dough equally in 
them, set to rise, then turn them out into the 
oven,' which must be quick. Rasp when done. 

To discover whether bread has been adulterated 

with wtiiting or chalk. 
89. Mix it with lemon-juice, or strong vinegar, 
and if this puts it into a state of fermentation, 
you may be certain it has a mixture of alkabne 
particles; and these are sometimes in large 
quantities in bakers' bread.

Excellent Rolls. 

40. Warm an ounce of butter in half a pint of 
milk, put to it a spoonful and a half of yeast of 
small beer, and a little salt. Put two pounds of 
flour into a pan, and mix in the above. Let it 
rise an hour ; knead it well ; make into seven 
rolls, and bake in a quick oven. 

If made in cakes three inches thick, sliced and 
buttered, they will resemble the celebrated Sally 
Lunn Bath roll. 

French Rolls, 

41. Rub an ounce of butter into a pound of 
flour; mix one egg beaten, a little yeast that is 
not bitter, and as much milk as will make a 
dough of a middling stiffness. Beat it well, but 
do not knead ; let it rise and bake on tins. 

Potato Rolls. 

42. Boil three pounds of potatoes, bruise and 
work them with two ounces of butter, and as 
much milk as will make them pass through a 
cullender. Take half or three quarters of a pint 
of yeast, and half a pint of warm water, mix 
with the potatoes, then pour the whole upon five 
pounds of flour, and add some salt. Knead it 
well : if not of a proper consistence, put a little 
more milk and water warm : let it stand before 
the fire an hour to rise; work it well, and make 
into rolls. Bake about half an hour in an oven 
not quite so hot as for bread. They eat well, 
toasted and buttered.

45. Warm two ounces of butter in as much 
skimmed milk as will make a pound of four into 
a very stiff paste, beat it with a rolling-pin, and 
work it very smooth. Roll it thin, and cut it 
into round biscuits ; prick them full of holes 
with a fork. About six minutes will bake them. 

Plain and very crisp Biscuits.

SWEET DISHES, SWEETMEATS, AND PRE- 

St:EVES. 



[Great caro has been taken in selecting the following 
receipts, to enable tiie purveyor to furnish the table with 
such clelicacies as cannot fail to satisfy the palate of the 
most fastidious epicure. These relisliinc: dainties should 
be got up with great precaution and cleanliness. The 
following colourings to stain jellies, ices, or cakes, should 
be strictly observed lo render them delicate and beauti- 
ful :— For red^ boil lifteen grains of cochineal in the finest 
powder, with a dram and a half of cream of tartar, in half 
a pint of water, very slowly, half an hour. Add in boiling 
a bit of alum the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, 
and some liquor poured over. For whtte^ use almonds 
finely powdered, with a little drop of water ; or use cream. 
For yellow^ yolks of Qgg»^ or a bit of saffron steeped in the 
liquor and squeezed. For green^ pound spinach leaves or 
beet-leaves, express the juice, and boil in a tea-cup in 
a saucepan of water to take off the rawness. Sweetmeats 
should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry 
place ; unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, 
a warm one does not hurt ; but when not boiled long 
enough, heat makes them ferment ; and damp causes 
them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or 
three times in the first two months, that they may be gently 
boiled again, if not likely to keep. Jellies of fruit, made 
with equal quantity of sugar, that is, a pound to a pint, 
require no very long boiling. A pan should be kept for 
the purpose of preser'ing. Sieves and spoons should be 
kept likewise for sweet things. Sweetmeats keep best in 
drawers that are not connected with a wall. If there be 
the least damp, cover them only with paper dipped in 
brandy, laid quite close; putting a little fresh over in 
spring, to prevent insect-mould.]

5. Cut a fine rich pufF paste rolled thin, with 
tin shapes made on purpose, one size less than 
another in a pyramidical form, and lay them so;

Rice Flummery. 

9. Boil with a pint of new milk, a bit of 
lemon-peel, and cinnamon ; mix with a little cold 
milk as much rice-flour as will make the whole 
of a good consistence, sweeten, and add a spoon- 
ful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten;

Cwrc?s and Cream. 



11. To four quarts of new milk warmed, put 
from a pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, 
according to its sourness ; keep the pan covered 
until the curd be of firmness to cut three or four 
times across with a saucer, as the whey leaves it; 
put it into a shape, and fill up until it be solid 
enough to take the form. Serve with cream 
plain, or mixed with sugar, wine, and lemon. 

Blanc -mange, 

12 Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half- 
pints of water half an hour; strain it to a pint 
and a half of cream ; sweeten it, and add some 
peach-water, or a few bitter almonds ; let it boil 
once up, put it into what forms yo" please. 
If not to be very stiff, a little less isinglass will 
do. Observe to let the blanc-mange settle before 
you turn it into the forms, or the blacks will re- 
main at the bottom of them, and be on the top 
of the blanc-mange when taken out of the moulds. 

Jaune- mange. 

13. Pour a pint of boiling water over two 
ounces of isinglass, and when it is dissolved add 
three quarters of a pint of white wine, the juice

jln excellent Trifle, 

14. Lay macaroons and ratafia-drops over the 
bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin 
wine as they will suck up; which, when they 
have done, pour on them cold rich custard made 
with more eqgs than directed in the foregoing 
pages, and some flour. It must stand two or 
three inches thick ; on that put a layer of rasp- 
berrv-jam, and cover the whole with a very high 
whip made the day before, of rich cream, the 
whites of two well beaten eggs, suyar, lemon-peel, 
and raisin wine ; w(ll beat with a whisk, kept 
only ^o whip syllabubs and creams. If made the 
day before used, it has a far better taste. 

Chantilly Cake, or Cake Trifle. 

15. Bake a rice cake in a mould. When cold, 
cut it round about two inches from the edge with 
a sharp knife, taking care not to perforate the 
bottom. Put in a thick custard, and some tea- 
spoonfuls of raspberry-jam, then put on a whip. 

Gooseberry Fool, 

16. Put the fruit into a stone jar, and some 
good sugar ; set the jar on a stove, or in a sauce- 
pan of water over the fire ; if the former, a large 
spoonful of water should be added to the fruit. 
When it is done enough to pulp, press it through 
a cullender ; have ready a sufficient quantity of 
new milk, and a tea-cup of raw cream, boiled 
together; or an eg^ instead of the latter, and 
left to be cold ; then sweeten it pretty well with 
fine sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees with it.

^/i excellent Cream. 

18. Whip up three quarters of a pint of very 
rich cream to a strong froth, with some finely 
scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the juice, half 
a glass of sweet wine and sugar, to make it 
pleasant, but not too sweet ; lay it on a sieve 
or in a form, and next day put it on a dish, and 
ornament it with very light puff-paste biscuits, 
made in tin shapes the length of a finger, and 
about two thick, over which sugar may be 
strewed, or a light glaze with isinglass. Or you 
may use macaroons, to line the edge of the dish. 

Burnt Cream. 

19. Make a rich custard without sugar, boiling

When cold it will be ready. A ratafia-drop may 
be put in each, if you choose it. If you wish it 
to keep, scald the cream previously. 

Ratafia Cream. 

21. Boil three or four laurel, peach, or nec- 
tarine-leaves, in a full pint of cream ; strain it ; 
and when cold, add the yolks of three eggs beaten 
and QJtrained, sugar, and a large spoonful of 
brandy stirred quick into it. Scald till thick, 
stirring it all the time. 

Lemon Cream. 

22. Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it 
the yolks of two eggs well boaten, four ounces 
of fine sugar, and the thin rind of a lemon ; boil

Almond Cream. 

25. Beat four ounces of sweet almonds, and a 
few bitter, in a mortar, with a tea-spoonful of 
water to prevent oiling, both having been 
blanched. Put the paste to a quart of cream, 
and add the juice, of three lemons sweetened; 
beat it up with a whisk to a froth, which take 
off on the shallow part of a sieve ; fill glasses with 
some of the liquor and the froth. 

Coffee Cream, much admired, 

26 Boil a calf's foot in water till it wastes 
to a pint of jelly, clear of sediment and fat. Make 
a tea-cup of very strong coffee ; clear it with a 
bit of isinglass to be perfectly brighr.; pour to 
it the jelly, and add a pint of very good cream, 
and 8s much fine sugar as is pleasant; give one 
boil up, and pour into the dish. It should jelly, 
but not be stiff. Observe that your coffee be 
fresh. 

Excellent Orange Cream. 

27. Boil the rind of a Seville orange very 
tender; beat it fine in a mortar; put to it a 
spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville 
orange, four ounces of loaf sugar, and the yolks 
of four eggs; beat together for ten minutes; 
then, by degrees, pour in a pint of boiling cream ; 
beat till cold; put into custard-cups set into a 
deep dish of boiling water, and let them stand 
till cold again. Put at the top small strips of 
orange-pareing cut thin, or preserved chips.

28. Scrape into one quart of thick cream, one 
ounce of the best chocolate, and a quarter of a 
pound of sugar; boil and mill it; when smooth 
take it off, and leave it to be cold ; then add the 
whites of nine eggs. Whisk; and take up the 
froth on sieves, as others are done ; and serve 
the froth in glasses, to rise above some of the 
cream. 

Raspberry Cream, 

29. Mash the fruit gently, and let them drain ; 
then sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will 
produce more juice ; tiien put the juice to some 
cream, and sweeten it; after which, if you choose 
to lower it with some milk, it will not curdle; 
which it would, if put to the milk before the 
cream ; but it is best made of raspberry-jelly, 
instead of jam, when the fresh fruit cannot be 
obtained. 

Clouted Cream, 

30. String four blades of mace on a thread ; 
put them to a gill of new milk, and six spoonfuls 
of rose-water ; simmer a few minutes; then by 
degrees stir this liquor strained into the yolks 
of two new eggs well beaten. Stir the whole 
into a quart of very good cream, and set it over 
the fire; stir it till hot, but not boiling hot; 
pour it into a deep dish, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Serve it in a cream dish, to eat with 
fruits. Many people prefer it without any 
flavour but that of the cream ; in which case use

a quart of new milk and the cream. When done 
enough, around mark will appear on the surface 
of the cream, the size of the bottom of the pan it 
is done in, and when that is seen, remove the pan 
from the fire. 

. Orange Jelly, 

31. Grate the rind of two Seville and two 
China oranges, and two lemons ; squeeze the juice 
of three of each, and strain, and add the juice to 
a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, and a quarter 
of a pint of water, and boil till it almost 
candies. Have ready a quart of isinglass-jelly 
made with two ounces ; put to it the syrup, and 
boil it once up ; strain off the jelly, and let it 
stand to settle as above, before it is put into the 
mould. 

Cranberry Jelly, 

32. Make a very strong isinglass-jelly. When 
cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry 
juice pressed and strained ; sweeten and boil it 
tip ; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must 
be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. 

Cranberry and Rice Jelly. ' 

28. Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, 
and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice 
as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly ; boil it 
gently, stirring it, and sweeten to your taste. 
Put it in a basin or form, and serve to eat as the 
afore-directed jelly, with milk or cream.

CcUfi Feet Jelly. 

34. Boil two feet in two quarts and a pint of 
water till the feet are broken, and the water half 
wasted; Strain it, and, when cold, take off the 
fat, and remove the jelly from the sediment ; 
then put it into a saucepan, with sugar, ra^sin- 
wine, lemon-juice to your taste, and some lemon- 
peel. When the flavour is rich, put to it the 
whites of five eggs, well beaten, and their shells 
broken. Set the saucepan on the fire, but don*t 
stir the jelly after it begins to warm. Let it boil 
twenty minutes after it rises to a head ; then pour 
it through a flannel jelly-bag, first dipping the 
bag in hot water to prevent waste, and squeezing 
it quite dry. Run the jelly through till clear ; 
then put it into glasses or forms. 

The following mode will greatly facilitate the 

clearing of jelly : When the mixture has boiled 

twenty minutes, throw in a tea-cupful of cold 

water; let it boil five minutes longer ; then take 

the saucepan off the fire covered close, and keep 

it half an hour; after which, it will be so clear 

as to need only once running through the bag, 

and much waste will be saved. Observe, ft»et 

for all jellies are boiled so long by the people 

who sell them, that they are less nutritious ; 

they should be only scalded to take off the hair. 

The liquor will require greater care in removing 

the fat; but the jelly will be far stronger, and 

of course allow more water. 

Note.— Jelly is equally eood made of cow-heels nicely 
cleaned ; and as they bear a less price than those of calves, 
and make a stronger jelly, this observation may be useful.

Apple Jelly to serve at table. 
35 Prepare twenty apples ; boil them in a pint 
and a halt of water, till quite tender ; then strain 
the liquor throue:h a cullender. To every pint 
put a pound of fine sue^ar ; add grated orange or 
lemon; then boil to a jelly. 

Baked Pears, 

36. These Deed not be of a fine sort; but some 
taste better than others, and often those that are 
least fit to eat raw. Wipe, but don't pare, and 
lay them on tin plates, and bake them in a slow 
oven. When enough to bear it, flatten them 
with a silver spoon. They should be baked 
three or four times, and very gently. 

Stewed Apples. 

37. Scoop out the core, pare them very fine, 
and as you do it, throw in water. For every 
pound of fruit, make half a pound of single-refined 
sugar in syrup, with a pint of water ; when skim- 
med, put the pippins in, and stew till clear : then 
grate lemon over, and serve in the syrup. Be 
careful not to let them break. 

They are an elegant and good dish for a corner 
or dessert. 

Stewed Pears. 

88. Pare and halve, or quarter, large pears, 
according to their size ; throw them into water, 
as the skin is taken off before they are divided, 
to prevent their turning black. Pack^ them* 
round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as much

sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and 
aid lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some all- 
spice cracked; just cover them with water. 
Cover them close, and stew three or four hours; 
when tender, take them out, and pour the liquor 
over them. 

- To prepare Ice for Iceing. 

89. Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to 
powder, throw a large handful and a half of salt 
among it. You must prepare it in a part of the 
house where as little of the warm air comes as 
you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being 
in a bucket, put your cream into an ice-pot, and 
cover it; immerse it in the ice, and draw that 
round the pot, so as to touch every possible part. 
In a few minutes put a spoon in, and stir it well, 
removing the parts that ice round the edges to 
the centre. If the ice-cream or water be in a 
form, shut the bottom close, and move the whole 
in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that 
without danger of waste. There should be holes 
in the bucket, to let off the ice as it thaws. 

Note. — When any fluid tends towards cold, the moving 
it quickly accelerates the cold; and likewise, when any 
fluid is tending to heat, stirring will facilitate its boiling^. 

Ice Waters, 

40. Rub some fine sugar on lemon or orange,' 
to give the colour and flavour, then squeeze the 
juice of either on its respective peel ; add water 
and sugar to make a fine sherbet, and strain it 
before it be put into the ice-pot. If orange the

greater proportion should be of the China juice, 
and only a little of Seville, and a small bit of the 
peel grated by the sugar. 

Currant or Raspberry Water Ice, 

41. The juice of these, or any other sort of 
fruit, being gained by squeezing, sweetened and 
mixed with water, will be ready for iceing. 

Ice Creams. 

42. Mix the juice of the fruits with as much 
sugar as will be wanted, before you add cream, 
which should be of a middling richness. 

Butter to serve as a little Dish. 

43. Roll butter in different forms; either like 
a pine, and make the marks with a tea-spoon, or 
roll it la crimping rollers, work it through a 
cullender, or scoop with a tea-spoon, and mix 
with grated beef, tongue, or anchovies. Make a 
wreath of curled parsley to garnish. 

Potted Cheese. 

44. Cut and pound four ounces of rich cheese, 
one ounce and a half of fine butter, a tea-spoon- 
ful of white pounded sugar, a little bit of mace, 
and a glass of white wine. Press it down in a 
deep pot. 

Roast Cheese to come up after Dinner, 

45. Grate three ounces of fat cheese, mix it 
with the yolks of two eggs, four ounces of grated 

bread, and three ounces of butter; beat the

an oven covered with a dish, till hot through, 
remove the dish, and let the cheese brown a 
little. Serve as hot as possible. 

Welsh Rabbit, 

46. Toast a slice of bread on both sides, and 
butter it; toast a slice of fine rich cheese on one 
side, and lay that next the bread, and toast the 
other with a salamander ; rub mustard over, and 
serve very hot, and covered. 

Cheese Toast, 

4t. Mix some fine butter, made mustard, and 
salt, into a mass; spread it on fresh-made thin 
toasts, and grate or scrape cheese upon them. 

Anchovy Toast, 

48. Bone and skin six or eight anchovies; 
pound them to amass with an ounce of fine butter 
till the colour is equal, and then sp^'ead it on 
toasts or rusks. 

Buttered Eggs, 

49. Beat four or five eggs, yolks and whites 
together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in 
a basin, and thei) put that in boiling water, stir 
it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs 
into a saucepan ; keep a basin in your hand, just

it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in the 
saucepan, and pouring it into the basin, more 
perfectly to mix the egg and butter, until they 
shall be hot without boiling, 

Serve on toasted bread ; or ia a basin, to eat 
with salt-fish, or red herrings. 

To green Fruits for preserving or pickling. 

50. Take pippins, apricots, pears, plums, 
peaches, while green for the first, or radish-pods, 
French beans for the latter, and cucumbers for 
both processes ; and put thpm, with vine-leaves 
under and over, into a block tin preserving-pan, 
with spring-water to cover them, and then the 
tin cover to exclude all air. Set it on the side of 
a fire, and when they begin to simmer, take thera 
off, pour off the water, and ir not green, putfre.-^h 
leaves when cold, and repeat the same. Take 
them out care^'illy with a slice; they are to be 
peeled, and th^n done according to Ihe re- 
ceipts for the several modes. 

To clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats. 
51. Break as much as required in large lumps, 
and put a pound to half a pint of water, in a bowl, 
and it will dissolve better than when broken 
small. Set it over the fire, with the well-whipt 
white of an ecrg; let it boil up, and, when ready 
to run over, pour a little cold water in to give it 
a check ; bub when it rises a second time, take it

pour the syrup into a vessel very thickly from 
the sediment. 

To candy amj sort of Fruit, 

52. When finished in the syrnp, put a layer 
into a new sieve, apd dip it suddenly into hot 
water, take off the syrnp that hangs about it ; 
put it on a napkin before the fire to drain, then 
do some more in the sieve. Have ready sifted 
double-relined sugar, which sift over the ifruit on 
all sides till quite white. Set it on the shallow 
end of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn it 
two or three times. It must not be cold till dry. 

Jl beautiful Preserve for Apricots. 

53. When ripe, choose the finest apricots; 
pare them as thin as possible, and weigh them. 
Lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow 
part upwards. Have ready an equal weight of 
good loaf-sugar finely pounded, and strew it 
over them ; in the meantime break the stones, 
and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain 
twelve hours, put it, with the sugar and juice, 
and also the kernels, into a preserving-pan. Let 
it simmer very gently till clear; then take out 
the pieces of apricots singly as they become so; 
put them into small pots, and pour the syrup 
and kernels over them. The scum must be taken 
oft as it rises. Cover with brandy-paper.

To preserve Apricots in Jelly, 

54. Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it; 
weigh an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder 
and strew over it. Next day boil very gently 
till they are clear, move them into a bowl, and 
pour the liquor over. The following day pour 
the liquor to a quart of apple liquor, made by 
boiling and straining, and a pound of fine sugar; 
let it boil quickly till it will jelly ; put the fruit 
into it, and give one boil, skim well, and put 
into small pots. 

Apricots or Peaches in Brandy. 

65. Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have 
ready a quarter of the weight of fine sugar in 
fine powder. Put the fruit into an ice-pot that 
shuts very close; throw the sugar over it, and 
then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the 
top and cover of the pot, put a piece of white 
paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water till 
the brandy be as hot as you can possibly bear to 
put your finger in, but it must not boil. Put 
the fruit into ajar, and pour the brandy on it. 
When cold, put a bladder over, and tie it down 
tight. 

Orange Marmalade 

66. Rasp the orangos, cut out the pulp, then 
boil the rinds very tender, and beat fine in a 
marble mortar. Boil three pounds of loaf-sugar

To fill preserved Oranges ; a corner dish. 
58 For five take a pound of Naples biscuits, 
some blanched almonds, the yolks of four eggs 
beaten, sugar to your taste; four ounces of butter 
warmed, grate the biscuits, and mix with the 
above and some orange-flower water. Fill pre- 
served oranges, and bake in a very slow oven. 
If you like them frosted, sift sugar over them as 
soon as filled : otherwise wipe them. Custard 
to fill will do as well ; if so, you need not bake 
the oranges, but put it in when become cold. 

To keep Oranges or Lemon for Pudding, ^c. 

59. When you squeeze the fruit, throw the 
outside in water, without the pulp ; let them re- 
main in the same a fortnight, adding no more ; 
boil them therein till tender, strain it from them, 
and when they are tolerably dry, throw them 
into any jar of candy you may have remaining 
from old sweetmeats ; or if you have none, boil a 
small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar 
and water and put over them ; in a week or ten 
days boil them gently in it till they look clear,

and that they may be covered with it in the jar. 
You may cut each half of the fruit in two, and 
they will occupy a small space. 

Orange Chips, 

60. Cut oranges in halves, squeeze the juice 
through a sieve; soak the peel in water ; next day 
boil in the same till tpnder, drain them, and slice 
the peels, put them to the juice, weigh as much 
sugar, and put altogether into a broad earthen 
dish, and put over ^hc lire at a moderate dis- 
tance, often stirring till the chips candy; then 
set them in a cool room to dry. They will not 
be so under three weeks. 

Orange-flower Cakes. 

61. Put four ounces of the leaves of the flowers 
into cold water for an hour ; drain, and put be- 
tween napkins, and roll with a rolhng-pin till 
thev are bruised ; then have ready boiled one 
pound of sugar to add to it in a thick syrup, 
give thpm a simmer, until the syrup adheres to 
the sides of the pan, droo in little cakes on a 
plate, and dry as before directed. 

To pi^eserve Strawherries whole, 

62. Take equal weights of the fruit and double- 
refined sugar; lay the former in a small dish, 
and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over ; 
give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar 
may touch the under side of the fruit. Next day

Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not 
dead ripe. In either of the above ways, they eat 
well served in thin cream, in glasses. 

To dry Cherries with sugar. 

63. Stone six pounds ; put them into a preserv- 
ing-pan, with two pounds of loaf-sugar pounded 
and strewed among them ; simmer till they begin 
to shrivel; then strain them from thejuice ; lay 
them on a hot stove, or in an oven wi>en either 
is C3ol enough to dry without baking them. The 
same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit. 

To dry Cherries without sugar, 

64. Stone, and set them over the fire in the 
preserving-pan ; let them simmer in their own 
liquor, and shake them in the pan. Put them 
by in common China dishes ; next day give them 
another scald, and put them, when cold, on sieves 
to dry, in an oven of steady heat. Twice heat-

65. Weigh the finest raorellas, having cut off 
half the stalk, prick them with a new needle, and 
drop them into a jar or wide-mouthed bottle. 
Pound three quarters the weight of sugar or 
white candy : strew over; fill up with brandy, 
and tie a bladder over.

Cherry Jam, 

66. To twelve pounds of Kentish or duke cher- 
ries, when ripe, weigh one pound of sugar ; break 
the 'stones of part, and blanch them: then put 
them to the fruit and sugar and boil all gently, 
till the jam comes clear from the pan. Pour it 
into China plates to come up dry to table. Keep 
in boxes with white paper between. 

Currant Jam, black, red, or white, 

67. Let the fruit be very ripe, pick it clean 
from the stalks, bruise it, and to every pound 
put three quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar ; stir 
it well, and boil half an. hour. 

Currant Jelly, red or black,

Jpple Jelly for preserving Apricots, or for any 

sort of Sweetmeats. 

70. Let apples be pared, quartered, and cored ; 
put them into a stew-pan with as much water 
as will cover them; boil as fast as possible; 
when the fruit is all in a mash, add a quart of 
water ; boil half an hour more, and run through 

ajellv-bag, 

if in summer, codlins are best ; in September, 
golden rennets or winter-pippins. 

Dried Apples, 

71. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, 
and flatten them by degrees, and gently, when 
soft enough to bear it. If the oven be too hot 
they will waste ; and at first it should be very 
cool. The biffin, the minshui crab, or any tart 
apples, are the sorts for drying. 

Gooseberry Jam for Tarts, 

72. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy goose- 
berries, when ripe and gathered in dry weather, 
into a pre8erving-pan,with a pint of currant-juice, 
drawn as for jelly ; let them boil pretty quick, 
and beat them with the spoon ; when they begin 
to break, put to them six pounds of white sugar, 
and simmer slowly to a jam. It requires long 
boiling, or will not keep ; but is an excellent 
thing for tarts or puffs. Look at it in two or three 
days, and if the syrup and fruit separate, the 
whole mu3t be boiled lonf er. Be careful it does 
not burn at the bottom.

While Gooseberry Jam, 



73. Gather the finest white gooseberries, or 
green if you choose, when just ripe; top and 
tail them. To each pound put three quarters of 
a pound of fine sugar, and half a pint of water. 
Boil and chirify the sugar in the water as direct- 
ed in page 284 ; then add the fruit ; simmer gen- 
tly till clear, then break it, and in a few minutes 
put the jam into small pots. 

To preserve Greengages, 

74. Choose the largest, when they begin to 
soften; split them without paring, and strew a 
part of the sugar which you have previously 
weighed an equal quantity of. Blanch the ker- 
nels with a small sharp knife. Next day, pour 
the syrup from the fruit, and boil it with the 
other sugar, six or eight minutes, very gently; 
skim, and add the plums and kerno. ^Oimmer 
till clear, taking off any scum that , .>ut the 
fruit singly into small pots, and pour the syrup 
and kernels to it.. If you would candy it, do not 
add the syrup, but observe the directions given 
for candying fruit in page 286 ; some may be 
done each way; 

Raspberry Jam, 
76. Weigh equal quantities of fruit and sugar ; 
put the former into a preserving-pan, boil and 
break it, stir constantly, and let it boil very 
quickly. When most of the juice is wasted, add 
the sugar, and oimmer half an hour,

This way the jam is greatly superior in colour 
and flavour to that which is made by putting 
the sugar in first. 

76. Another way.— Put the fruit in a jar 'n a 
kettle of water, or on a hot hearth, till the juice 
will run from it, then take away a quarter of a 
pint from every pound of fruit ; boil and bruise 
it half an hour, then put in the weight of the 
fruit in sugar, and, adding the same quantity of 
currant-juice, boil it to a strong jelly. 

The raspberry-juice will serve to put into 
brandy, or may be boiled with its weight in sugar 
for making the jelly or raspberry-ice or cream. 

Ginger Drops; a good Stomachic. 

77. Beat two ounces of fresh candied orange 
in a mortar, with a little sugar, to a paste ; then 
mix one ounce of powder of white ginger with 
one pound of loaf-sugar Wet the sugar with a 
little water, and boil altogether to a candy, and 
drop it on paper the size of mint-drops. 

Lemon Drops. 

78. Grate tnree large lemons, with a large 

piece of double-refined sugar; then scrape the 

sugar into a plate, add half a tea-spoonful of flour, 

mix well, and beat it into a light paste with 

the white of an egg. Drop it upon white paper, 

and put them iato a moderate oven on a tin 

plateu

Biscuits of Fruit. 
79 To the pulp of any scalded fruit put an 
eaual weight of sugar sifted, beat it two hours, 
then put it into little white paper forms, dry in 
a cool oven, turn the next day, and in two or 
three days box them. 

Peppermint Drops. 

80. Pound and sift four ounces of double-re- 
fined sugar, beat it with the whites of two eggs 
till perfectly smooth; then add sixty drops of 
oil of peppermint, beat it well and drop on white 
paper, and dry at a distance from the fire. 

Ratafia Drops, 

81. Blanch and beat in a mortar four ounces of 
bitter, and two ounces of sweet almonds with a 
little of a pound of sugar sifted, and add the re- 
mainder of the sugar, and the whites of two eggs, 
making a paste ; of which put litt e balls, the 
size of a nutmeg, on wafer-paper ; bake gently 
on tin-plates. 

Raspberry Cakes ^ 
82 Pick out any bad raspberries that are 
among the fruit, weigh and boil what quantity 
vou please, and when mashed, and the liquor is 
wasted, put to it sugar the weight of the fruit 
yoVL first put into the pan, mix it well off the 
fire until perfectly dissolved, then put it on 
china-plates, and dry it in the sun. As soon as 
the top part dries, cut with the cover of a can-

To keep Currants. 

83. The bottles being perfectly clean and dry, 
let the currants b^ cut from the large stalks 
with the smallest bit of stalk to each, that the 
fruit not being wounded, no moisture may be 
among them. It is necessary to gather them 
when the weather is quite dry ; it is best to cut 
them under the trees, and let them drop gently 
into the bottles. 

Stop up the bottles with cork and rosin, and 
put them into a trench in the garden with the 
neck downwards ; stocks should be placed 
opposite to where each sort of fruit begins. 

Cherries and Damsons keep in the same way. 

Currants may be scalded, as directed hereafter 
for gooseberries. 

To keep Gooseberries. 

84. Before they become too large, let them be 
gathered, and take care not to cut them in taking 
oiF the stalks and buds. Fill wide-mouthed bot- 
tles ; put the corks loosely in, and set the bottles 
up to the neck in water in a boiler. When the 
fruit looks scalded, take them out; and when 
perfectly cold, cork close, and rosin the top. 
Dig a trench in a part of the garden least used, 
sufficiently deep for all the bottles to stand, and 
let the earth be thrown over, to cover them a 
foot and a half. When a frost comes on, a little 



■A ■ 








296

fresh litter from the stable will prevent the 
ground from hardening so that the fruit cannot 
be dug up. Or, scald as above ; when cold, fill 
the bottles with cold water, cork them, and keep 
them in a damp or dry place ; they will not be 
spoiled. 

China Orange Juice.— A very useful thing to 
mix with ''water in Fevers, when the fresh 
Juice cannot be procured. 

85. Squeeze from the finest fruit a pint of juice 
strained through fine muslin, and gently simmer 
with three quarters of a pound of double-refined 
sugar twenty minutes ; when cold put it in small 

bottles. 

To keep Lemon Juice. 

86. Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a 
cool place two or three days, if too unripe to 
squeeze easily ; cut the peel off some, and roll 
them under your hand to make them part with 
the juice more readily; others you may leave 
unpaired for grating, when the pulp shall be 
taken out and dried. Squeeze the juice into a 
China basin; then strain it through some muslin, 
which will not permit the least pulp to pass. 
Have ready half and quarter ounce phials per- 
fectly dry; fill them with the juice so near the 
top as only to admit half a tea-spoonful of sweet 
oil into each; or a little more, if for larger 
bottles. Cork the bottles, and set them upright 
in a cool place. 

When you want lemon-juice, open such a

To preserve Fruit for Tarts, or Family -desserts, 

SY. Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American 
apples, gather when ripe, and lay them in small 
jars that will hold a pound; strew over each jar 
six ounces of good loaf-sugar pounded ; cover 
with two bladders each, separately tied down ; 
then set the jars on a large stewpan of water up 
to the neck, and let it boil three hours gently. 
Keep these and all other sorts of fruit free from 
damp. 

To keep Damsons for Winter Pies, 

88. Put them in small stone jars, or wide 
mouthed bottles ; set them up to their necks in 
a boiler of cold water, and lighting a fire under, 
scald them. Next day, when perfectly cold, fill 
up with epring water; cover them. 

89. Another way. — Boil one-third as much 
sugar as fruit with it, over a slow fire, till the 
juice adheres to the fruit, and forms a jam. Keep 
it in small jars in a dry place. If too sweet, mix 
with it some of the fruit that is done without 
sugar.

PART XIII. 

SALADS, TOMATOES, AND PICKLES. 

rSoTfKR, the celebrated French cook says : " What is more 
refreshing than salads when your appetite seems to have 
deserted you, or even after a capacious dinner--the nice, 
fresh, green, and crisp salad, full of life and health, which 
seems to invigorate the palate and dispose the masticating 
powers to a much longer duration." Experience has 
taught us to say that Soyer is right, and salads should be 
brought into more general use, viev ng them at once as 
food and a purifier of the blood ; to tl t end we here insert 
some of the .numerous herbaceous .ilants, which, with 
a few " flxins," nicely finishes up a dinner at small cost. 
Use a wooden spoon and fork.] 

Salad Sauce. 
1. Boil one egg hard, when cold remove the 
yolk, put it into a basin, bruise it to a pulp with 
a wooden spoon, do not use iron, then add a raw 
yolk and a tea-spoonful of flour, a small tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a quarter of pepper, then 
add half a spoonful of vinegar; stir it round, 
pour oyer a table-spoonful of oil by degrees, keep 
stirring, then a little more vinegar, two more of 
oil, until eight tea-spoonfuls of oil and three of 
vinegar are used; season with half a tea-spoon 
ful of chopped onions, two of parsley, half of 
tarragon and chervil, a pinch of cayenne and six 
tea-spoonfuls of melted butter cold. The white 
of the egg may be chopped up and added. It 
will keep for some time if properly corked, and

ing salads : a gill of whipped cream is good in it. 

Fish Salad, 

2. For a small lobster salad, half fill a bowl 
with any kind of salad herb, endive, lettuce, (fee. 
Then break a lobster in two, open the tail, extract 
the meat in one piece, break the claws, cut the 
meat of both in small slices, about a quarter of 
an inch thick, arrange these tastefully on the 
oalad, take out all the soft part from the belly, 
mix it in a basin with a tea-spoonful of salt, half 
of pepper, four of vinegar, four of oil; stir it well 
together, and pour on the salad ; then cover it 
with two hard eggs, cut in slices, a few slices of 
cucumbers, and, to vary, a few capers and some 
fillets of anchovy ; stir lightly, and serve, or use 
salad sauce, No. 1. 

If for dinner, ornament it with some flowers of 
the nasturtion and marigold. 

3. Another. — Make a salad, and put some of 
the red part of the lobster to it, cut. This forms 
a pretty contrast to the white and green of the 
vegetables. Do not put much oil, as shell-fish 
absorb the sharpness of the vinegar. Serve in a 
a dish, not a bowl. 

Crab Salad. 

4. The same as the lobster. 

Note.— Remains of cold cod, fried soles, halibut, brill 
turbot, sturgeon, cut as lobster, plaice, and all kinds o} 
fresh water flsh, may be used in the same way.

Coss Lettuce, 

5. Take two large lettuces, remove the faded 
leaves and the coarse green ones, cut the i^reen 
top off, pull each leaf off separate, cut it length- 
ways, and then in four or six pieces. This is 
better without washing. Having cut it all up, 
put it into a bowl; sprinkle over a small tea- 
spoonful of salt, half one of pepper, three of oil, 
and two of vinegar ; with the spoon and fork 
turn the salad lightly in the bowl till well mixed ; 
the less it is handled the better ; a tea-spoonful 
of chopped chervil and one of tarragon is a great 
improvement. 

Cabbage Lettuce, 

6. Proceed the same as above, pull off the 
outer leaves, take off the others one by one, and 
cut in two, put them in a pan with cold water, 
then drain them in a cloth, by shaking it to and 
fro, and extract all the water, put them into a 
bowl, and season and dress as above. To vary 
them, two hard boiled eggs, cut in quarters, 
may be added ; a little eschalot, a few chives, or 
young onions. To improve the appearance of 
these salads, when on the table, the flower of 
the nasturtion may be intermixed with a little 
cut beet-root and slices of radish. Slices of 
cucumber may be also introduced. 

Endive. 

♦7. This ought to be nicely blanched and crisp, 
and is the most wholesome of all salads. Take 
two, cut away lie root, remove the dark green

8. Another, French Fashion. — Pub in one clove 
of garlic, or rub a piece of crust of bread slightly 
with it, or the salad-bowl, mix the salad in the 
bowl as before; if rubbed slightly on the bread 
mix it with it. If properly contrived, it gives a 
flavour which no one can detect. Tarragon or 
chervil may be used in these salads. 

Marsh Mallow, 

9. The roots of these should be removed, as 
like\xise the faded leaves ; dress as for lettuce, 
No. 5, eggs and beet-root may be introduced in 
th^s, being almost a winter salad. Dandelion or 
dent-de-lion, should not remain long in water, as 
they will get too bitter ; dress them as endive. 
Water-cresses, the same, with a little cucumber 
and celery. 

Mustard and Cress. 

10. These, if eaten alone, make an excellent 
salad; they should be quickly washed and used, 
dressed as lettuce. A little tarragon or chervil, 
or a few chives, may be used. 

Beet-root Salad^ with Onions, 

11. Boil four onions in the skin till tender, also 
a piece of beet-root ; let both get cold ; remove 
the skin, cut them in slices, put them in a plate, 
one slice on the edge of the other alternately ;

put into a small basin half a tea-spoonful of salt, 
a quarter of pepper, one of good vinegar, three 
of oil, mix them well ; pour over when ready to 
serve. Celery, young onions, and radishes may 
be used in salad with the above dressing, adding 
a tea-spoonful of mustard. 

Haricot and Lentil Salad, 

12. To a pint of well-boiled haricots, add a 
tea-spooiiful of salt, quarter of pepper, one of 
chopped onions, two of vinegar, four of oil, two 
of chopped parsley, stir round, and it is ready: 
lentils are done the same way. A little cold meat 
cut in thin slices, may be added as a variety. 

Green French Beans, 

13. Cold boiled French beans put into a bowl 
make a very nice salad mixed with some chervil, 
tarragon, chopped chives, celery, <fee., with the 
usual salad-sauce. 

m^* Brussels Sprouts may be done the same 
way. 

Potatoes 

14 If any cold potatoes remain, cut them into 
thin slices, and season as before. Haricots, cold 
meat, or a few chopped gherkins may be added.

mustard, and salt. When well mixed, add by 
degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very

two or three inches long. Shake them in the 
seasoning, and then put more ; cover the bowl 
close, and let the salad be prepared three hours

a few slices of the fat. 

Sidney Smith's Receipt for Salad, 

Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve, 
Unwonted softness to the salad give ; 
Of mordant mustard add a single spoon- 
Distrust the condiment which bites so soon; 
But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt ; 
Three times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 
And once with vinegar, procured from town. 
True flavor needs it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. 
Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole ; 
And, lastly, on the flavoured compound toss 
A magic tea-spoon of anchovy sauce. 
Then, though green turtle fail, though venison's tought 
And ham and turkeys are not boiled enough. 
Serenely full the Epicure may say — 
Fate cannot harm me— I have dined to-day !

MANUAL OF COOKERY. 



[Tomatoes deservingly class among the most wholesome 
of vegetables, but are frequently spoiled by the manner in 
which they are prepared for table; it is very seldom they 
are sufficiently cooivcd, and they are more often served as 
. a sour porridge than otherwise. They should always be 
well cooked, from one to three hours, according to the 
nature of the cooking, which, when thoroughly done, may 
be closely sealed in cans or bottles, and kept for years ; or 
the pulp may be spread upon plates and dried in the sun 
or in a slow oven, it will keep as well as dried pumpkin, 
apples, peaches, &c., and will be equally acceptable in the 
winter time. For every-day use, as much as the family 
will consume in a week may be cooked at once, which can 
be eaten cold or warmed up.] 

j1 Tomato Dinner. 
17. The fruit should be cut in halves, and the 
seeds scraped out. The mucilage of the pulp may 
be saved, if desired, by straining out the seeds 
and adding it to the fruit, which should boil 
rapidly for an hour and simmer three hours more 
until the water is dissolved and the contents of 
the saucepan a pulp of mucilaginous matter, 
which is much improved by putting in the pan, 
either before putting in the fruit or while it is 
cooking, an ounce of butter and half a pound of 
fat bacon cut fine, to half a peck of tomatoes, and 
a small pepper-pod with salt to suit the taste. 
The fat adds a pleasant flavor, and makes the 
dish actual food instead of a mere relish. The 
pan must be carefully watched, and but little 
fire used, and the mass stirred often to prevent 
burning, towards the last, when the water is 
nearly 111 evaporated. The dish may be rendered 
still more attractive and rich as food by breaking 
in two or three eggs, and stirring vigorously just 
enough to allow the eerffs to become well cooked.

Stuffed Tomatoes, 

18. Scoop out the inside of a dozen large to- 
matoes, without spoiling their shape. Pass the 
inside through a sieve, and then mix it with 
grated bread, chopped sweet herbs, nutmeg, 
salt, and pepper. Stew well with a laurel leaf, 
or two peach leaves. Remove the leaves, and 
stuff the tomatoes with the mixture, tying a 
string round each to keep them in shape. Sprin- 
kle them all over with rasped bread-crust. Set 
them in a buttered dish, and bake them in an 
oven. Take off the strings, and serve up the to- 
matoes. Egg plants may be cooked in the same 
manner. 

Tomato Sweetbreads, 

19. Cut up a quarter of a peck or more of fine 
ripe tomatoes ; set them over the fire, and let 
them stew, with nothing but their own juice, 
till they go entirely to pieces ; then press them 
through a sieve, to clear the liquid from the seeds 
and skins ; have ready four or five sweetbreads 
that have been trimmed nicely, cleared from the 
gristle and laid open to soak in warm water ; 
put them into a stewpan with the tomato-juice, 
seasoned with a little salt and Cayenne ; add 
two or three tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in 
flour : set the saucepan over the fire, and stew 
the sweetbreads in the tomato-juice till they are 
thoroughly done ; a few minutes before you 
take them off, stir in two beaten yolks of eggs. 
Serve up the sweetbreads in a deep dish, with

Scalloped Tomatoes, 

20. Take fine large tomatoes, perfectly ripe; 
scald them to loosen the skins, and then peel 
them ; cover the bottom of a deep dish thickly 
with grated bread-crumbs, adding a few bits of 
fresh butter ; then put in a layer of tomatoes 
seasoned slightly with a little salt and Cayenne 
and some powdered mace or nutmeg; cover 
them with another layer of bread-crumbs and 
butter, then another layer of seasoned tomatoes, 
and proceed thus till the dish is full, finishing at 
the top with bread-crumbs ; set. the dish into a 
moderate oven, and bake it near three hours. 

Stewed Tomatoes, 

21. Slice the tomatoes into a tinned saucepan; 
season with pepper and salt, and place bits of 
butter over the top ; put on the lid close, and 
stew twenty minutes. After this, stir them fre- 
quently, letting them stew till well done; a 
spoonful or two of vinegar is an improvement. 
This is excellent with roast beef or mutton. 

Tomato Soup. 

22. Put in five quarts of water a chicken, or 
a piece of any fresh meat, and six thin slices of 
bacon ; let them boil tor some time, skimming 
carefully, then throw in five or six dozen peeled 
tomatoes, let the water boil away to about one 
quart, take out the tomatoes, mash and strain 
them through a sieve ; mix a piece of butter as 
large as a hen's egg with a table-spoonful of

half an hour. Lay slices of toasted bread in the 
tureen and pour the soup on. 

Fried Ham with Tomatoes, 

23. Fry some slices of cold boiled ham. Then 
fry some tomatoes, allowing one to each slice of 
meat. Lay the tomatoes on the ham, shake a 
little pepper over them, and serve. 

Tomato Preserves, 

24. Take the round yellow variety as soon as 
ripe, scald and peel ; then to seven pounds of 
tomatoes add seven pounds of white sugar, and 
let them stand over night ; take the tomatoes out 
of the sugar, and boil the syrup, removing the 
scum ; put in the tomatoes, and boil gently fifteen 
or twenty minutes; remove the fruit again, and 
boil until the syrup thickens. On cooling, put 
the fruit into jars, and pour the syrup over it, 
and add a few slices of lemon to each jar, and 
you will have something to please the taste of 
the most fastidious. 

Tomato Sauce, 

25. Take one dozen of ripe tomatoes, put them 
into a stone jar, stand them in a cool oven until 
quite tender. When cold, take the skins and 
stalks from them, mix the pulp in the liquor

which you will find in the jar, bat do not strain 
it, add two tea-spoonfuls of the best powdered 
ginger, a dessert-spoonful of salt, a head of garlic 
chopped fine, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, 
a dessert-spoonful of Chili vinegar or a little 
Cayenne pepper. Put into small-mouthed sauce 
bottles, sealed. Kept in a cool place, it will 
keep good for years. It is ready for use as soon 
as made, but the flavor is better after a week or 
two. Should it not appear to keep, turn it out, 
add more ginger ; it may require more salt and 
Cayenne pepper. It is a long tried receipt— a 
great improvement to curry. The skins should 
be put into a wide mouthed bottle, with a little 
of the different ingredients, as they are useful for 
hashes or stews. 

Tomato Catsup. 

26. Take ripe tomatoes, and scald them just 
sufficient to allow you to take off the skin ; then 
let them stand for a day, covered with salt ; 
strain them thoroughly to remove the seeds ; 
then to every two quarts, three ounces of cloves' 
two of black pepper, two nutmegs, and a very 
little Cayenne pepper, with a tittle salt ; boil 
the liquor for half an hour, and then let it cool 
and settle ; add a pint of the best cider vinegar, 
after which bottle it, corking and sealing it 
tightly. Keep it always in a cool place. 

27. Another way, — Take one bushel of toma- 
toes, and boil them till they are soft ; squeeze 
them through a fine wire sieve, and add half a

about three hours ; or until reduced to about 
one-half; then bottle, without straining. 

To pickle Tomatoes, 

28. Always use those which are thoroughly 
ripe. The small round ones are decidedly the 
best. Do not prick them, as most receipt-books 
direct. Let them lie in strong brine three or 
four days, then put them down in layers in your 
jars, mixing with them small onions and pieces 
of horse-radish ; then pour on the vinegar (cold), 
which should be first spiced as for peppers; let 
there be a spice-bag to throw into every pot. 
Cover them carefully, and set them by in the 
cellar for a full month before using. 

To Cook Tomatoes as a Vegetable. 

29. Cut as many tomatoes in half as will make 
a dish ; put them into a baking dish, with a lump 
of butter and some pepper and salt. Bake them 
until soft, and then dish up hot.

[PioKLES should be kept closely covered; always use a 
wooden spoon, all mettle being improper. The large jars 
should be seldom opened ; and small ones, for the different 
pickles in use, for common supply. Acids dissolve the 
lead that is in the tinnings of saucepans. When necessary 
to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on the hot hearth, or in 
an enamelle'^' saucepan. Pickles should never be put into 
glazed jars, as salt and vinegar penetrate the glaze, which 
is poisonous.] 

Cold Pickles, 

30. Season some of the best vinegar with a 
little garlic, a little tarragon, and a little sweet 
oil. Put it into a glass jar,' and keep it jfvell cov- 
ered. You may throw into it the green seeds 
of nasturtions, morella cherries, little onions, 
small young carrots when but a finger long.radish 
pods, and various other things. Keep the jar 
well closed, and the pickles will be as good and 
keep as long as if they had oeen boiled. 

Nasturtions and cherries will keep in plain 
vinegar without any seasoning. 

Indian Pickle. 

31. Lay a pound of white ginger in water one 
night ; then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt, in 
a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready. 

Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlic three 
days, then put it in the sua to dry. Salt and 
dry long pepper in the same way. 

Prepare various sorts of vegetables thus :

not too large. All must be salted, drained, 
and dried in the susi, except the latter ; over 
which you must pour boiling vinegar, and in 
twelve hours drain them, but no salt must be 
used. 

Put the spice, garlic, a quarter of a pound 
of mustard-seed, and as much vinegar as you 
think enough for the quantity you are to pickle 
into a large stone jar, and one ounce of turmeric, 
to be ready against the vegetables shall be dried. 
When they are ready, observe the following 
directions: — Put some of them into a stone jar, 
and pour over them one quart of boiling vinegar. 
Next day takeout those vegetables ; and when 
drained, put them into a large stock jar, and 
boiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of 
the vegetables ; let them lie a night, and do as 
above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed 
each set from the dust which must inevitably 
fall on them by being so long in doing ; then, 
to every gallon of vinegar put two ounces of 
flour of mustard, mixing by degrees, with a little 
of it boiling hot. The whole of the vinegar 
should have been previously scalded, but left to 
be cold before it was put to the spice. Stop the 
jar tight. 

This pickle will not be ready for a year ; but 
you may make a small jar for eating in a fort-

night, only by giving the cauliflower one scald 
in water, after salting and drying as above, but 
without the preparative vinegar ; then pour the 
vinegar, that has the spice and garlic, boiling 
hot over. If at any time it be found that the 
vegetables have not swelled properly, boiling 
the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will 

plump them. 

Pickle Onions. 

32. In the month of September, choose the 
small white round onions, take off the brown 
skin, have ready a very nice tin stewpan of boil- 
ing water, throw in as many onions as will cover 
the top ; as soon as they look clear on the outside, 
take them up as quick as possible with a slice 
and lay them on a clean cloth ; cover them close 
with another, and scald some more, and so on. 
Let them lie to be cold, then put them in ajar, 
or glass, or wide-mouth bottles, and pour over 
them the best white wine vinegar, just hot, but 
not boiling. When cold cover them. Should 
the outer skin shrivel, peel it off. They must 
look quite clear. 

To pickle Gucumbers and Onions sliced, 

33. Cut them in slices, and sprinkle salt over 
them, next day drain them for five or six hours ; 
then put them into a stone jar, pour boiling 
vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm 
pla5je. The slices should be thick. Repeat the 
boiling vinegar,and stop them up again instantly ; 
and so on till green ; the last time put pepper 
and ginger. Keep in small stone jars.

To pickle young Cucumbers,

on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week — 
drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour 
boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the 
fire, covered with plenty of vine-leaves ; if they 
do not become a tolerable good green, pour the 
vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, 
and when it boils, pour it over them again, 
covering with fresh leav^^s ; and thus do till they 
are of as good a color as you wish them. As it is 
now known that the very fine green picklea are 
made so bv usint: brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, become 
highly poisonous, few people like tc eat them. 

To pickle Walnuts. 

35. Put them into a jar, cover them with the 
best vinegar cold, let them stand four months ; 
then pour off the pickle and boil as mnch fresh 
vinegar as will cover the walnuts, adding to 
every three quarts of vinegar one quarter-pound 
of best mustard, a stick of horse-radish sliced, 
one half-ounce of black pepper, one half-ounce 
of cloves, one ounce of ginger, one half-ounce ot 
allspice, and a good handful of salt — pour the 
whole, boiling hot, upon the walnuts, and cover 
them close ; they will be fit for use in three or 
four months. You may add two ounces of garlic, 
or shalot, but not boiled in the vinegar. 

5]^" Of the pickle in which the walnuts stood 
for the first four months, you may make excel- 
lent ketchup .

An excellent way to pickle Mushrooms, to 
preserve the flavour, 

86. Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flan- 
nel and salt; and from the larger, take out the 
red inside. When they are black they will not 
do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and 
put them into a stew-pan with some mace and 
pepper ; as the liquor comes out shake them 
well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of 
it be dried into them again ; then put as much 
vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it 
one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. 
They will keep two years, and are delicious. 

Mushroom Ketchup. 

BY. Take the largest broad mushrooms, break 
them into an earthen pan, strew salt over, and 
stir them now and then for three days Then 
let them stand for twelve, till there is a thick 
scum over ; strain, and boil the liquor with 
Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, a clove 
or two, and some mustard-seed. When cold, 
bottle it, and tie a bladder over the cork ; in 
three months boil it again with some fresh spice, 
and it will then keep a twelvemonth. 

To pickle Red Cabbage, 

38. :Slic8 it into a cullender, and sprinkle each 
lay^ with salt ; let it drain two days, then put 
it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put a few slices of red beet-root. Ob- 
serve to choose the purple red cabbage. Those

Some persons prefer boiling the vinegar with 
the spice and throwing it on to the pickles, cab- 
bage, or onions, when cold. 

Lemon Pickle. 

39. Wipe six lemons, cut each into eight 
pieces; put on them a pound of salt, six large 
cloves of garlic, two ounces of horse-radish sli- 
ced thin, likewise of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and 
Cayenne, a quarter of an ounce each, and two 
ounces of flour of mustard ; to these put two 
quarts of vinegar. Boil a quarter of an hour in 
a well-tinned saucepan; or, which is better, do 
it in a strong jar, in a kettle of boiling water ; or 
set the jar on the hot hearth till done. Set the 
jar by, and stir it daily for six weeks, keep the 
jar close covered. Put it into small bottles. 

To keep Capers, 

40. Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, 
and become cold — and tie them close, to keep 
out the air, which makes them soft.

ALE, BEEE, WINES AND SUMMER DEINK8. 

[To be successful in producing a " horn " of bright clean- 
tasted ale, or beer, it will be essential to see that the casks 
and bottles be perfectly prepared and cleansed to avoid 
any musty or other unpalatable flavour, and that the corks 
be of the best quality. During hot or thundery weather 
if beer turns sour, a tea-spoonful of salt of wormwood put 
into the jug will rectify it. Let it be drawn just before it 
19 drunk or it will be flat.] 

Strong Beer or Ale, 

1. Tweve bushels of malt to the hogshead for 
beer, (or fourteen if you wish it of a very good 
body,) eight for ale; for either pour the whole 
quantity of water hot, but not boiling, on at 
once, and let it infuse three hours close covered ; 
mash it in the first half-hour, and let it stand the 
remainder of the time. Run it on the hops pre- 
viously infused in water ; for strong beer three 
quarters of a pound to a bushel ; if for ale, half 
a pound. Boil them with the wort two hours 
from the time it begins to boil. Cool a pailful 
to add three quarts of yeast to, which will pre- 
pare it for putting to the rest when ready next 
day ; but if possible put together the same night. 
Tun |s usual. Cover the bung-hole with paper 
when the beer has done working ; and when it 
is to be stopped, have ready a pound and a half 
of hops dried before the fire, put them into the

months in casks, and twelve months in bottles 
before it be drank. It will keep fine eight or ten 
years. It should be brewed the beginning of 
March. 

The ale will be ready in three or four months; 
and if the vent-peg never be removed, it will 
have spirit and strength to the very last. Allow 
two gallons of water at first for waste. 

After the beer or ale has run from the grains, 
pour a hogshead and a half for the twelve bushels, 
and a hogshead of water if eight were brewed ; 
mash, and let stand, anri then boil, <fec. Use some 
of the hops for this table-beer that were boiled 
for the strong. 

Excellent Table Beer, 

2. On three bushels of malt pour of hot water 
the third of the quantity j^ou are to use, which is 
to be thirty-nine gallons. Cover it warm half 
an hour, then mash, and let it stand two hours, 
and a half more, then set it to drain. When dry, 
add half the remaining water, mash, and let it 
stand half an hour, run that into another tub, 
and pour the rest of the water on the malt, stir 
it well, and cover it, letting it infuse a full hour. 
Run that off, and mix all together. A pound 
and a half of hops should be infused in water, as 
in the former receipt, and be put into the tub for 
the first running. 

Boil the hops with the wort an hour from the 
time it first boils. Strain off and cool. If the 
whole be not opol enough that day to add to the

yeast, a pail or two of wort may be prepared, 
and a quart of yeast put to it over night. Before 
tunning, all the wort should be added together, 
and thoroughly mixed with the lad(:^-pail. When 
the wort ceases to work, put a bit of paper on 
the bung-hole for three days, when it it may be 
safely fastened close. In three or four weeks the 
beer will be fit for drinking. 

Note.— A cork should replace the tap when taken out 
of the empty barrel, and the vent-peg fastened in, as the 
admission of air will make it foul and musty. 

To refine Beer, Me, Wine, or Cider. 

^ 3. Put two ounces of isinglass shavings to soak 
in a quart of the liquor that you want to clear, 
b<^at it with a whisk every day till dissolved. 
Draw off a third part of the cask, and mix the 
above with it : likewise a quarter of an ounce of 
pearl-ashes, one ounce of salt of tartar calcined, 
and one ounce of burnt alum powdered. Stir it 
well, then return the liquor into the cask, and 
stir it with a clean stick. Stoo it up, and in a 
few days it will be fine. 

To preserve Yeast, 
4. When you have plenty of yeast, begin to 
save it in the following manner: whisk it until 
it becomes thin, then take a new large wooden 
dish, wasn it very nicely, and when quite dry, 
lay a layer of yeast over the inside with a soft 
brush;* let it dry, then put another layer in the 
aame manner, and so do until you have a suflS- 
cient quantity, observing that each coat dry

out; stir it in warm water. — If to be used for 
brewing, keep it by dipping large handfuls of 
birch tied together; and when dry repeat the 
dipping once. You may thus do as'many as you 
please ; but f ake care that no dust comes to them, 
or the vessel in which it has been prepared as 
before. When the wort is set to work, throw 
into it one of these bunches, and it will do as 
well as with fresh yeast; but if mixed with a 
small quantity first, and then added to the whole, 
it will work sooner. 



[In this highly-favoured Canada, this adopted country of 
ours, where all kinds of food are abundant and cheap, but 
wines comparatively scarce and high-priced, from the fol- 
lowing carefully selected receipts the want may be sup- 
plied at a trifling expense. If carefully made and kept, 
say three or four years, a proportionable strength being 
given, they would answer every purpose of foreign wines 
for health, culinary, or other domestic purposes.] 

Raspberry or Currant Wine. 

5. Put five quarts of currants, and a pint of 
raspberries, to every two gallons of water ; let 
them soak anight; then squeeze and break them 
well. Next day rub them well on a fine wire 
sieve, till all the juice is obtained, washing the 
skins again with some of the water; then to 
every gallon put four pounds of very good moist 
sugar, tun it immediately, and lay the bung 
lightly on. Do not use any thing to work it. In

two or three days put a bottle of brandy to every 
four gallons ; bung it close, but leave the pe^ 
out at top a few days; keep it three years, and 
It will be a very fine agreeable wine ; four years 
would make it still better. 

Raspberry Wine. 

6. To every quart of well-picked raspberries 
put a quart of water ; bruise and let them stand 
two days ; strain off the liquor, and to every 
gallon put three pounds of lump-sugar; when 
dissolved put the liquor into a barrel, and when 
fine, which will be in about two months, bottle 
It, and to each bottle put a spoonful of brandy 
or a glass of wine. 

Raspberry Brandy, 
V. Pick fine dry fruit, put into a stone jar 
and the jar into a kettle of water, or on a hot 
hearth, till the juice will run ; strain, and to 
every pint add half a pound of sugar, give one 
boil, and skim it ; when cold put equal quantities 
of juice and brandy, shake and bottle. Some 
people prefer it stronger of brandy. 

Black Currant Wine, very fine. 
8. To every three quarts of juice, put the 
same of water unboiled; and to every three 
quarts of the liquor, add three pounds of pure 
moist ^ugar. Put it into a cask, preserving a

White Currant Shrub, 

9. Strip the fruit, and prepare in ajar as for 
jelly; strain the juice, of which put two quarts 
to one gallon of rum, and two pounds of lump- 
sugar; strain through a jelly -bag. 

Blackberry Wine, 

10. Measure your berries and bruise them, to 
every gallon adding one quart of boiling water; 
let the mixture stand twenty-four hours, stirring 
occasionally ; then strain off the liquor into a 
cask, and to every gallon adding two pounds of 
sugar ; cork tight, let it stand till the following 
October. 

Note.— We are told that from the above receipt, you 
will have wine ready for use, without any further strain- 
ing or boiling, that will make lips smack as they never 
smacked, under similar influence, before. 

Elder Wine, 

11. To every quart of berries put two quarts 
of water, boil half an hour, run the liquor, and 
break the fruit through a hair-sieve ; then to 
every quart of juice, put three quarters of a 
pound of sugar. Boil the whole a quarter of an

hour with some Jamaica peppers, ginger, and a 
few cloves. Pour it into a tub, and when of a 
proper warmth into the barrel, with toast and 
yeast to work, which there is more difficulty to 
make it do than most other liquors. When it 
ceases to hiss, put a quart of brandy to eight 
gallons, and stop up. Bottle in the spring or at 
Christmas. The liquor must be in a warm 
place, to make it work. 

Excellent Ginger Wine, 
12. Put into a very clean boiler ten gallons of 
water, fifteen pounds of lum^-sugar, with the 
whites of six or eight egg^^ well beaten and 
strained; mix all well while cold; when the 
liquor boils skim it well ; put in half a pound of 
common white ginger bruised, boil it twenty 
minutes. Have ready the very thin rinds of 
seven lemons, and pour the liquor on them ; when 
cool tun it with two spoonfuls of yeast: put a 
quart of the liquor to two ounces of isinglass- 
shavings, while warm, whisk it well three or 
four times, and pour all together into the barrel. 
Next day stop it up ; in three weeks bottle, and 
m three months it will be a delicious and refresh- 
ing liquor; and though very cool, perfectly safe. 

Excellent Raisin Wine. 

13. To every gallon of spring-water put eight 
pounds of fresh Smyrna raisins in a large tub ; 
stir it thoroughly every day for a month ; then 
press the raisins in a horse-hair bag as dry as

possible ; put the liquor into a cask ; and when 
it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best 
brandy or strong whiskey, stop it close for 
twelve months ; then rack it off, but without the 
dregs; filter them through a bag of flannel of 
three or four folds; add the clear to the quanti 
ty, and pour one or two quarts of brandy, ac- 
cording to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, 
and, at the end of three years, you may either 
bottle it, or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine 
would be extremely good, if made rich of the 
fruit and kept long, which improves the flavour 
greatly. 

Sack Mead. 

14. To every gallon of water put four pounds 
of honey, and boil it thr< e quarters of an hour, 
taking care to skim it. To every gallon add an 
ounce of hops ; then boil it half an hour, and let 
it stand till next day : put it into your cask, and 
to thirteen gallons of ^he liquor add a quart of 
brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fer- 
mentation is over, and then stop it very close. 
If you make a large cask, keep it a year in cask. 

Ratafia. 

16, Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot 
kernels, bruise and put them into a bottle, and 
fill nearly up with brandy. Dipsolve half a 
pound of white sugar-candy in a cup of cold 
water, and add to the brandy after it has stood 
a month on the kernels, and they are strained 
off ; then filter through paper, and bottle for use.

MANUAL OF COOKBRY. 



The leaves of peach and nectarines, when the 
trees are cut in the spring, being distilled, are an 
excellent substitute for ratafia in puddings. 

A rich and pleasant Wine. 
16. Take new cider from the press, mix it with 
as much honey as will support an ogg, boil gently 
fifteen minutes, in an enamelled pot. Skim it 
well; when cool, let it be tunned, but don't 
quite fill. In March following, bottle it, and it 
will be fit to drink in six weeks ; but will be less 
sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have 
a rich strong wine, and it will keep well. This 
will serve for any culinary purposes which sack, 
or sweet wine, is directed for. 

Honey is a fine ingredient to assist, and render 
palatable new crabbed austere cider. 

An excellent Method of making Punch. 

17. Take two large fresh lemons with rough 

skins, quite ripe, and some large lumps of double 

refined sugar. Rub the sugar over the lemons 

till it has absorbed all the yellow parts of the 

skins. Then put into the bowl these lumps, and 

as much more as the juice of the lemons may be 

supposed to require ; according to taste, then 

squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar; and 

with a bruiser press the sugar and the juice well 

together, for a great deal of the richness and fine 

flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing 

and mixing process being thoroughly performed. 

Then mix this up well with boiling water (soft

water is best) till the water is rather cool. When 
this mixture (called the sherbet) is to your taste, 
take brandy and rum in equal quantities, and 
put them to it, mixing the whole well together 
again. The quantity of liquor must be according 
to your taste: two good lemons are generally 
enough to make four quarts of punch, including 
a quart of liquor, with half a pound of sugar ; 
but this depends much on the taste, and on the 
strength of the spirit. 

As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, 
the sherbet may be strained before the liquor is 
put in. Some strain the lemon before they put 
it to the sugar, which is improper ; as, when the 
pulp and sugar are well mixed together, it adds 
much to the richness of the punch. 

When only rum is used, about half a pint of 
porter will soften the punch : and even when both 
rum and brandy are used, the porter gives a 
richness, and to some a very pleasant flavour. 

Note. This receipt has been greatly admired by con- 
noisseurs. It is impossible to take too much pains in the 
process of wixing, and in minding to do them well^ that all 
the different articles may be most thoroughly incorporated. 

18. Artother. — Take three large lemons, and 
roll them very hard on the table to make them 
more juicy ; then pare them as thin as possible. 
Cut out the pulp and throw away the seeds and 
the white part of the rind. Put the yellow rind 
and the pulp into a pint of boiling water ; set it 
on the fire, and let it boil two or three minutes. 
Take it off, and throw in a tea-spoonful of raw

green tea of the best sort, and let it infuse about 
five minutes. Then strain it through linen. Stir 
into it three quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar, 
and a pint of brandy, or any other suitable 
liquor. Set it again over the fire, and when it 
is just ready to boil, remove it, and pour it into 
a china punch-bowl. 

[For the benefit of the poorer class of persons, we cive 
the following tried receipts, which will be found less 
iDjurious in their effects than others of a more potent and 
exciting character, though quite as palatable.] 

Vin de Pommes : or, Apple Wine, 

19. Boil a gallon of water, in it cut up one 
pound of apples into quarters, and boil them till 
they can be pulped, pass the liquor through a 
cullender, boil it up again with half a pound of 
brown sugar, scum, and bottle for use. Take care 
not to cork the bottle; keep in cool place. The 
apple may be eaten with sugar and a scrape of 
nutmeg ; or as sauce for roast pork or goose. 

20. Another way.-^ Bake the apples, then put 
them into a gallon pan, add the sugar, and pour 
boiling water over, let it get cold, pass the liquor 
as above, and bottle for use. 

For Spring Drink, 

21. Rhubarb, in the same quantities, and done 
in the same way as apples, adding more sugar, 
makes ^ nice cooling drink. 

Also green gooseberries, similarly prepared.

For Summer Drink, 

23. One pound of red currants, bruised with 
some raspberry ; half a pound of sugar added to

Lemonade to be made the day before wanted, 

26. Pare two dozen of tolerably-sized lemons 
as thin as possible, put eight of the rinds into 
three quarts of hot not boiling water, and cover 
it over for three or four hours. Rub some fine 
sugar on the lemons to attract the essence, and 
put it into a china-bowl, into which squeeze the 
juice of the lemons. To it add one pound and a 
half of fine sugar, then put the water to the 
above, and three quarts of milk made boiling 
hot; mix, and pour through a jeily-bag till per- 
fectly clear. 

Lemonade that has the flavour and appearance 

of Jelly. 

27. Pare two Seville oranges and six lemons 
as thin as possible, and steep them four hours in 
a quart, of hot water. Boil a pound and a quar- 
ter of loaf-sugar in three pints of water, and 
skim it. Add the two liquors to the juice of six 
China oranges, and twelve lemons ; stir the 
whole well, and run it through a jelly-bag till 
clear. Then add a little orange-water, if you 
like the flavour, and, if wanted, more sugar. It 
will keep well if corked. 

Ginger Beer. 
28. The following is a very good way to make 
it: Take of ginger, bruised or sliced, one and a 
half ounce; cream of tartar, one ounce; loaf 
sugar, o^e pound ; one lemon sliced ; put them 
into a pan, and pour six quarts of boiling water

yeast, with the white of one egg mixed in it, 
and stir it for about a minute. Let it 
stand till next day, then strain and bottle it. It 
is fit to drink in three days, but will not keep 
good longer than a fortnight. The corks should 
be tied down, and the bottles placed upright in 
a cool place. 

Raspberry Vinegar. 

29. Put a pound of fruit into a bowl, and pour 
upon it a quart of the best vinegar ; next day 
strain the liquor on a pound of fresh raspberries; 
and the following day do the same, but do not 
squeeze the fruit, only drain the liquor as dry 
as you can from it. The last time pass it through 
a canvass previously wet with vinegar to pre- 
vent waste. Put it into a stone jar, with a pound 
of sugar to every pint of juice, iDroken into large 
lumps ; stir it when melted, then put the jar into 
a saucepan of water, or on a hot hearth, let it 
simmer, and skim it. When cold, bottle it. 

This is one of the most useful preparations that 
can be kept in a house, not only as affording the 
most refreshing beverage, but being of singular 
efiicacy in complaints of the chest. A large 
spoonful or two in a tumbler of water will give 
you a nice cooling drink. Be careful to use no 
glazed nor metal vessel for it. The fruit with 
an equal quantity of sugar, makes excellent 
Raspberry Cakes without boiling.

COOKEET FOR THE SICK, COFFEE, <fec. 

[To assist in the speedy recovery of sick persons and con- 
valescents, or those whose system have become reduced 
from^eneral debility, it has been thought advisable to 
devote a few pages to receipts for such preparations as 
will afford nourishment, with delicacy of flavour which 
18 necessary to persons with lost appetites. It may not 
be out of place to remind those who have care of the sick 
that It IS beneficial to furnish the patient with a chanee of 
diet occasionally, and to always have one kind ready for 
use. These should succeed each other, varied in form and 
flavour.] ^ 

Extract of Malt^ for Coughs. 
1. Over half a bushel of pale ground malt pour 
as much hot, not boiling water,"as will just cover 
it. In forty-eight hours drain off the liquor 
entirely, but without squeezing the grains; put 
the former into a large sweetmeat-pan, or sauce- 
pan, that there may be room to boil as quick as 
possible, without boiling over; when it begins 
to thicken stir constantly. It must be as thick 
as treacle. A dessert-spoon thrice a-day. 

A very strengthening Broth, 

2. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a 
very large handful of chervil, in two quarts of 
water to.one. Take off part of the fat. Any 
other herT) or roots may be added. Take half a 
pint three or four times a day.

Calves'-fcei Broth, 

7. Boil two feet in three quarts of water, to 
half ; strain and set it by ; when to be used, take 
off the fat, put a latge tea-cupful of the jelly in- 
to a sauce-pan, with half a glass of sweet wine, a 
little sugar and nutmeg, and heat it up till it be 
ready to boil, then take a little of it, and beat 
by degrees to the yolk of an egg, and adding a 
bit of butter, the size of a nutmeg, stir it all to- 
gether, but don*t let it boil. Grate a bit of fresh 
lemon-peel into it.

of veal, and two of beef, the bottom of a penny- 
loaf, two or three bl des of mace, half a nutmeg 
sliced, and a little salt, irf three quarts of water, 
to three pints; strain, and take off the tat. 

Chicken Broth, 

9. Put the body and legs of the fowl that 
chicken panada was made of, as in page 334, 
after taking off the skin and rump, into the water 
it was boiled in, with one blade of mace, one 
slice of onion, and ten white pepper-corns. Sim- 
mer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If 
not water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter

13. Take a leg of well-f^d pork, just as cut up, 
beat It, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle 
tire, with three gallons of water, and simmer to 
one. Let half an ounce of mace, and the same of 
nutmegs, scew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. 
When cold, take off the fat. Give a tea-cupful 
morning, noon, and night, putting salt to taste. 

Arrow-root Jelly. 
^ 14. Of this beware of having the wrong sort, 
for It has been counterfeited with bad effect. If 
genuine, it is very nourishing for weak bowels. 
Put into a saucepan half a pint of water, a glass 
of sherry, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar; boil 
once up, then mix it by degrees into a dessert- 
spoonful of arrow-root,previously rubbed smooth, 
with two spoonfuls of cold water; then turn the 
whole into the saucepan ; stir and boil it three

Pour three quarts of water to them, and set them 
on a hot hearth close covered ; let them simmer 
as gently as possible for five hours, then strain 
it off, and put it in a cold place. 

This may have the addition of a pound of beet, 
if approved, for flavour. It is a remarkably 
good thing for people who are weak. 

Tapioca Jelly. 

16. Choose the largest sort, pour cold water 
on to wash it two or three times, then soak it in 
fresh water five or six hours, and simmer it in 
the same until it becomes quite clear ; then put 
lemon-juice, wine, and sugar. The peel should 
have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. 

Panada, made in Jive minutes. ' 

17. Set a little water on the fire with a glass

up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, 
and let it boil as fast as it can. When of a pro- 
per thickness just to drink, take it off;

like ; it should be such as you can drink, though 
tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment. 

Sippets y when the Stomach will not receive Meat, 

19. On a very hot plate put two or three 
sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy 
from beef, mutton, or veal, if there is no butter in 
the dish. Sprinkle a little salt over. 

Eggs. 

20. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten 
and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a break- 
fast more supporting than tea only. 

An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten 
separately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will 
afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove 
lighter than when taken together. 

Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in 
small quantity, convey much nourishment ; the 
yolk, only, when dressed, should be eaten by 
invalids.

and the same quantity of new milk, in a iar,

add the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small Umon, 
six spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, 
and syrup of lemons one ounce. 

J jP/i ^ • Caudle. 

28. Into five large spoonfuls of the purest 
water rub smooth one dessert-spoonful of fine 
fiour. Set over the fire five spoonfuls of new 
milk, and put two bits of sugar into it; the 
moment it boils, pour into it the flour and water ; 
and stir it over a slow fire twenty minutes. It 
is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This 
is an excellent food for babies who have weak 

bowels.

the water, adding milk while doing. The pro- 
portion of water must be small. This is much 
ordered, with toast, for the breakfast of weak 

persons. 

Ground-rice Milk. 

32. Boil one spoonful of ground-rice rubbed 
down smooth, with three half pints of milk, a 
bit of cinnamon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg. 
Sweeten when nearly done. 

Sago, 

33. To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold 
water an hour ; pour that off, and wash it well, 
then add more, and simmer gently till the berries 
are clear, with lemon-peel and spice, if approved. 
Add wine and sugar, and boil all up together. 

Sago Milk, 

34. Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly and 
wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that 
a small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and 
when done it will be diminished to about a pint. 
It requires no sugar or flavouring. 

Asses' Milk

made. It should be milked into a glass that is 
kept warm, by being in a basin of hot water. 

The fixed air that it contains gives some people 
a pain^n the stomach. At first, a tea-spoonful 
of rum may be taken with it, but should only be

Artificial Asses^ Milk, 

36. Boil together a quart of water, a quart of 
new milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half 
an ounce of eringo-root, and half an ounce of 
conserve of roses, till half be wasted. 

This is astringent; therefore proportion the 
doses to the effect, and the quantity to what will 
be used while sweet. 

3*7. Another. — Mix two spoonfuls of boiling 
water, two of milk, and an egg well beaten; 
sweeten with pounded white sugar-candy. This 
may be taken twice or thrice a day. 

j1 refreshing Drink in a Fever, 
38. Put a little tea-sage, two sprigs of balm, 
and a little wood-sorrel, into a stone jug, having 
first washed and dried them ; peel thin a small 
lemon, and clear from the white ; slice it, and 
put a bit of the peel in; then pour in three pints 
ojf boiling water, sweeten and cover it close. 

39. Another DnnA;.-— Wash extremely well an 
oun-?^ of pearl-barley ; shift it twice, then put to 
it three pints of water, an ounce of sweet almonds 
beaten fine, and a bit of lemon-peel ; boil till 
you have a smooth liquor, then put in a little 
syrup of lemons and capillaire. 

jlpple Toast and Water, 

40. See page 126, No. 20. A piece of bread 
slowly toasted till it gets quite black, and added, 
makes a very nice and refreshing drink for 
invalids.

Apple Barley Water, 

41. Aquarter of apoiind of pearl-barley,in8tead 
of toast, added to the former, and boil for one 
hour, is also a very nice drink. 

Water Gruel. 

42. Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees 
into a pint of water, and when smooth boil it. 

43. Another wa'i/.—'Ruh smooth a large spoon- 
ful of oatrr<?al with two of water, and pour it 
into a pint of water boiling on the fire ; stir it 
well, and boil it quick ; but take care it does not 
boil over. In a quarter of an hour strain it off ; 
add salt and a bit ofbutter when eaten. Stir 
until the butter be incorporated. 

Barley Gruel. 

44. Wash four ounces of pearl-barley, boil it 
in two quarts of water and a stick of cinnamon, 
till reduced to a quart; strain and return it into 
the saucepan with sugar, and three quarters of 
a pint of port wine. Heap up and use as wanted .

port, some sugar and nutmeg ; boil together, and 
serve with toast. Or it may be made of good 
British wine.

48. See No. 25, page Z2l. 

Toast and Water, 

49. Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till 
extremely brown and hard, but not the least 
black ; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, 
and cover it over an hour before used. This is 
of particular use to weak bowels. It should be 
of "a fine brown colour before drinking. 

Jpple Rice Water, 
50. Half a pound of rice, boiled with apples 
until in pulp, passed through a cullender, and 
drunk when cold. All kinds of fruits may be 
done the same wav. Figs and French plums are 
excellent; also raisins. A little gmger, if ap- 
proved of, may be used. 

Barley Water, 
61. Wash a handful of common barley, then 
simmer it gently in three pints of water with a 
bit of lemon-peel. This is less apt to nauseate 
than pearl-barley; but the other is a very 
pleasant drink.

62. Another way.— Boil an ounce of pearl- 
barley a few minutes to cleanse, then put on it 
a quart of water, simmer an hour; when half 
done, put into it a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and 
one bit of sugar. If likely to be too thick, you 
may put another quarter of a pint of water. 
Lemon-juice may be added, if chosen. 

Lemon-water^ a delightful Drink, 

63. Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into 
a teapot, a little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, 
or a large spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint' 
of boiling water, and stop it close two hours. 

Apftle Water, 

64. See page 326, No. 19. Or, cut two large 
apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling water 
on them ; or on roasted apples ; strain in two or 
three hours, and sweeten lightly. 

Raspberry Vinegar Water, 

66. See page 329. This is one of the most 
delightful drinks that can be made. 

Whey, 

66. That of cheese is a very wholesome drink 
especially when the cows are in fresh herbage.

Pour the whey off, and add to it half a pint of 
boiling water, and a bit of white sugar. Thus 
you will have a whey perfectly cleared of milky 
particles, and ap weak as you choose to make it. 

Butter-milk, with Bread or without. 

68. It is most wholesome when sour, as being 
less likely to be heavy ; but most agreeable when 
made of sweet cream. 

Dr, Boerhaave's sweet Butter-milk, 

69. Take the milk from the cow and put into a 
small churn ; in ten minutes begin churning, and 
continue till the flakes of butter swim about 
pretty thick, and the milk is discharged oi all 
the greasy Darticles, and appears thm and blue. 
Strain it through a sieve, and drmk it as fre- 
quently as possible. It should form the whole 
of the patient's drink, and the food should be 
biscuits and rusks, in every way and sort ; ripe 
and dried fruits, of various kinds, when a decline 
is apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisms 
in particular, make excellent suppers for invalids, 
with biscuits, or common cake. 

Orgeat. 
60. Beat two ounces of almonds with a tea- 
spoonful of orange-flower water, and a oi^^^^^J 
almond or two f then pour a quart of milk and 
water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar, or 
capillaire. This is a fine drink for those who

have a tender chest ; and in the gout it is highly 
useful, and, with the addition of half an ounce of 
gum-arflbic, has been found to allay the painful- 
ness of the attendant heat. Half a glass of brandy 
may be added if thought too cooling in the latter 
complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put 
into a basin of warm water. 

Egg Wine, 

61. Beat an egg, mix with it a spoonful of cold 
water; set on the fire a glass of white wine, half 
a glass of water, sugar, and nutmeg. When it 
boils, pour a little of it to the egg by degrees till 
the whole be in, stirring it well; then return the 
whole into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, 
stir it one way for not more than a minute; for if 
it boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve 
with toast. 

Note.— Egg wine may be made as above, without 
warming the egg, and it is thev lighter on the stomach, 
though not so pleasant to the taste. 

[Having now paid attention to the necessary requirements 
of the eick, which we hope will be attended with the full 
restoration of health to the patient, it will not be out of 
place to insert the annexed receipts, which will be found 
acceptable by the attendant nurse, with the adjunct of a 
light bun, cracknel, &c., as being highly refreshing.] 

To make Coffee. 

62. Put two ounces of fresh-ground coflfee, of 

the belt quality, into a coffee-pot, and pour eight 

coffee-cups of boiling water on it ; let it boil six

tiful clearness. -, • t /* 

Fine cream should always be served with cottee 
and either pounded sugar-candy, or fine sugar. 

If for foreigners, or those who like it extremely 
strong, make only eight dishes from three ounces. 
If not fresh roasted, lay it before a fire until per- 
fectly hot and dry ; or, you may put the smallest 
bit of fresh butter into a preserving-pan of a 
small size, and, when hot, throw the coffee 
in it, and toss it about until it be freshened, 
letting it be cold before ground. 

Simplified mode of making Coffee. 
63 Put one ounce of ground coffee in a pan, 
which place over the fire ; keep stirring it until 
quite hot, but take care it does not burn ; then 
pour over quickly a quart of boiling water, close 
It immediately, keep it not far from the fire, but 
not to simmer : then fill your cup without shak- 
ing it ; or pass it through a cloth into a coffee- 
pot, or it may be made pome time previous, and 
warmed again. The grounds can be kept, and 
boiled for making the coffee of the next day, by 
which at least a quarter of an ounce is saved. 
In country places, where milk is good and cheap, 
half boiled milk should be used with the coffee. 
Warming coffee will economise full ten per cent.

Coffee Milk. 



64. Boil a dessert-spoonful of erround coffee in 
nearly a pint of milk, a quarter of an hour ; then 
put into it a shaving or two of isinglass, and clear 
it ; let it boil a few minutes, and set it on the 
side of the fire till fine. 

This is very good for breakfast ; it should be 
sweetened with sugar of a good quality. 

Chocolate, 

66. Those who use much of this article will find 
the following mode of preparing it both useful 
and economical : 

Cut a cake of chocolate in very small bits ; put 
a pint of water into the pot, and, when it boils, 
put in the above ; mill it off the fire until quite 
melted, then put it on a gentle fire till it boils ; 
pour it into a basin, and it will keep in a cool 
place eight or ten days, or more. When wanted 
put a spoonful or two into milk, boil it with 
sugar, and mix it well. 

This, if not made thick, is a very good break- 
fast or supper. 

Patent Cocoa

many as superior to tea or coffee, for breakfast.

PARTXVI. 

THE DAIRY, POULTRY, &c. 

rCows should be carefully treated ; if their teats are sore, 
they should be soaked in warm water twice a day, and 
dressed with soft ointment, or washed with smnt ana 
water. The milk should be given to the pigs. When the 
milk is brought into the dairy, it should be stramed and 
emptied into clean pans immediately in winter, but not 
till cool in summer. White ware is preferable, as the red 
is porous, and cannot be so thoroughly scalded All the 
utensils, shelves, dressers, and the floor, should be kept m 
perfect deanliness, and cold watei thrown over every part 
very often. There should be shutters to keep out the sun 
and the hot air. Meat hung in a dairy will spoil milk. 
The cows should be milked at a regular and early hour, 
and the udders emptied, or the quantity will decrease. A 
change of pasture will tend to increase the milk. Feed 
the cbws well two or three weeks before they calve, which 
makes the quantity of milk more abundant alter. J 

To prepare Rennet to turn the Milk. 
1. Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as 
killed, and scour it inside and out with salt, 
after it is cleared of the curd always found in it. 
Let it drain a few hours : then sew it up with 
two good handfuls of salt in it, or stretch it well 
salted on a stick ; or keep it in the salt wet, and 
when wanted soak it a little in fresh water, and 
repeated the same when again required. 

To make Cheese, 
2. Put the milk into a large tub, warming a 
part till it is of a degree of heat quite equal to 
new ; if too hot the cheese will be tough, i'ut 




h i ^ 



348 



MANUAL OF COOKERY. 



in as much rennet as will turn it, and cover it 
over. Let it stand till completely turned ; then 
strike the curd down several times with the 
ekimming-dieh, and let it separate, still covering 
it. There are two modes of breaking the curd ; 
and there will be a difference in the taste of the 
cheese, according as either is observed ; one is, 
to gather it with the hands very gently towards 
the side of the tub, letting the whey pass through 
the fingers till it is cleared, and ladling it off as 
it collects. The other is, to get the whey from it 
by early breaking the curd ; the last method de- 
prives it of many of its oily particles, and is there- 
fore less proper. 

Put the vat on a ladder over the tub, and fill 
it with curd by the skimmer; press the curd 
close with your hand, and add more as it sinks ; 
and it must be finally left two inches above the 
edge. Before the vat is filled, the cheese-cloth 
must be laid at the bottom : and when full, draw 
smooth over on all sides. 

There are two modes of salting cheese : one by 
mixing it in the curd while in the tub after the 
whey is out; and the other by putting it into 
the vat and crumbling the curd all to pieces 
with it, after the first squeezing with the hands 
has dried it. The first method appears best on 
some accounts, but not on all ; and therefore the 
custom of the country must direct. Put a board 
undftr and over the vat, and place it in the press ; 
in twdhours turn it out and put a fresh cheese- 
cloth ; press it again for eight or ten hours ; 
then Rait it all over, and turn it again in the vat,

and let it stand in the . ress fourteen or sixteen 
hours, observing to ; - the cheese last made 
undermost. Before putting them the last ime 
into the vat, pare the edges if they do not look 
smooth. The vat should have holes at the sides 
and at bottom, to let all the whey pass thi'0"g^^- 
Put on clean boards, and change and scald them. 

To preserve Cheese sound, 
3 Wash in warm whey, when you have any, 
and wipe it once a month, and keep it on a rack. 
If you want to ripen it, a damp cellar will bring 
it forward. When a whole cheese l^ cut the 
larger quantity should be spread with butter 
inside, and the outside wiped to preserve it To 
keep hose in daily use, moist, let a clean cloth 
be wrung out from cold water, and wrapt round 
them when carried from the table. Dry cheese 
mlyhe used to advantage to grate for serving 
witl macaroni, or eaung without. These oj.serva^ 
tions are made with a view to make the above 
articles less expensive, as in most families where 
much is used there is waste. 

Cream Cheese. 
4 Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last 
of the milk into a pan with two joonfuls of 
rpnnet When the curd is come, strike it down 
two or three times with the skimming-dish just

your hand, and put it into a vat with a two- 
pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours, 
take it out, and bind a fillet round. Turn every 
day till dry, from one board to another ; cover 
them with nettles, or clean dock-leaves, and put 
between two pewter-plates to ripen. If the 
weather be warm, it will ready in three weeks. 

5. Another sort — Put as much salt to three 
pints of raw cream as shall season it ; stir it well, 
and pour it into a sieve in which you have folded 
a cheese-cloth three or four times, and laid at 
the bottom. When it hardens, cover it with 
nettles on a pewter-plate. 

To a quart of fresh c eam put a pint of new 
milk warm enough to m ;ke the cream a proper 
warmth, a bit of sugar, and a little rennet. 

Set near th^ "re till the curd comes ; fill a vat 
made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw, or 
rushes sewed together. Eave ready a square of 
straw, or rushes sewed flat, to rest the vat on, 
and another to cover it ; the vat being open at 
top and bottom. Next day take it out, and 
change it as above, to ripen. A half pound 
weight will be sufficient to put on it. 

To scald Cream, as in the West of England. 

6. In winter let th' milk stand twenty-four 
hours, in the summer twelve at least : then put 
the milk-pan on the stove. It must remain on 
the fire till quite hot, but on no account boil, or 
there w^U be a skin instead of a cream upon the 
milk. You will know when done enough, by

the undulations on the surface looking thick, and 
having a ring round the pan the size of the 
bottom. The time required to scald cream de- 
pends on the size of the pan, and the heat of the 
fire; the slower the better. Remove the pan 
into' the dairy when done, and skim it next day. 
In cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours. 
The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream 
thus prepared, and if properly done is very firm. 

Butt er -milk ^ 

7. If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and 
most wholesome food. Those who can relish 
sour butter-milk, find it still more light ; and it 
is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. 
Butter-milk, if not very sour, is also as good as 
cream to eat with fruit, if sweetened with white 
sugar, and mixed %vith a very little milk. It 
likewise does equally well for cakes and rice- 
puddings. 

To keep Milk and Cream. 

8. In hot weather, when it is difficult to pre- 
serve milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the 
cream, it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding 
the new milk very gently, without boiling, and 
setting it by in the earthen dish, or pan, that it 
is done in. This method is pursued in Devon- 
shire, and tor butter, and eating, would equally 
answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &a 
Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four 
houra if scalded without sugar ; and, by adding 




862 



MANUAL OF COOKERY. 



to it as much powdered lump-sugar as shall make 
it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping 
it in a cool place. 

rTHEBB is no one article of family consumption more in 
use, of greater variety in goodness, or that is of more con- 
sequence to have of a superior quality, than butter, and the 
economising of which is more necessary. The sweetness 
of butter is not affected by the cream being turned, of 
which it is made. When cows are in turnips, or eat 
cabbages, the taste is very disagreeable ; and the following 
ways have been tried with advantage to obviate it : When 
the milk is strained into the pans, put to every six gallons 
one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one ounce of 
nitre in a pint of spring-water, and put a quarter of a pint 
to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or, when you churn, 
keep back a quarter of a pint of the sour cream, and put 
it into a well scalded pot, into which you are to gather the 
next cream; stir that well, and do so with every iresh 
addition.] 

To make Butter, 

9. During summer, skim the milk when the 
sun has not heated the dairy; at that season it 
should stand tor butter twenty-four hours with- 
out skimming, and forty-eL_,ht in winter. Deposit 
the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your 
dairy is not more so. If you cannot churn daily, 
change it into scalded fresh pots ; but never omit 
churning twice a week. If possible, put the 
churn in a thorough air ; and if not a barrel one, 
set it in a tub of water two feet deep, which will 
^ive firmaess to the butter. When the butter is 
come, pour off the butter-milk, and put the butter 
into a fresh-scalded pan, or tubs which have 
afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on 
it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness before

with fiat boards so perfectly that not the least 
taste of the butter-milk remain, and that the 
water, which must be often changed, shall be 
quite clear in colour. Then work some salt into 
it, weigh, and make it into forms ; throw them 
into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover. 
You will then have very nice and cool butter in 
the hottest weather. It requires more working 
in hot than in cold weather; but in neither 
should be left with a particle of butter-milk, as 
is sometimes done, which will cause a sour taste. 

To "preserve Butter, 
10. Take two parts of the best common salt, 
one part good loaf-sugar, and one part of salt- 
petre ; beat them well together. To sixteen 
ounces of butter thoroughly cleansed from the 
milk, put an ounce of this composition: work it 
well,' and pot down, when become firm and cold. 
The butter thus preserved is the better for keep- 
ing and should not be used under a month. This 
article should be kept from the air, and is best m 
pots of the best gj^^.^A earth, that will hold from 
ten to fourteen pouad'^ each. 

To preserve BMer for Winter, the best way. 
11 When the butter has been prepared, m 
above directed,take two parts of the best common 
salt, one part of good loaf-sugar, and one part 
of seltpetre, beaten and blended well together. 
Of this mixture put one ounce to sixteen ounces

of butter, and work it well together in a mass. 
Press it into the pans after the butter is become 
cool ; for friction, though it be not touched by 
the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold 
ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some 
salt ; and when that is turned into brine, if not 
enough to cover the butter entirely, add some 
strong salt and water. It requires only then to 
be covered from the dust. 

riN order to have fine fowls, it is necessary to choose a 
good breed. They should be fed as nearly as possible at 
the same hour and place. Potatoes boiled, unskmned, m 
a little water, then cut, and wet with skimmed milk, form 
one of the best foods. Turkeys and fowls thrive amazmglv 
on them. The best age for sitting a hen, is from two to 
five years; and you should remark which hens make the 
best brooders, and keep those to laying who are giddy and 
careless of their young. Hens sit twenty days. Convenient 
places should be provided for their laying, as these will 
be proper for sitting likewise. While hens are laying, feed 
them well,and sometimes with oats. The day after chickens 
are hatched, give them some crumbs of white bread, ana 
small (or rather cracked) grits soaked in milk. The pip 
in fowls is occasioned by drinking dirty water, or taking 
filthy food. A white thin scale on the tongue, is the 
symptom. Pull the scale ofi' with your nail, and rub the 
tongue with |ome salt; and the complaint will be re- 
moved.] 

To make Hens lay. 

12. Dissolve an ounce of Glauber's salts in a 
quart of water ; mix the meal of potatoes with a 
little of the liquor, and feed the hens two days, 
giving them plenty of clean water to drink. The 
above quantity is sufficient for six or eight hens. 
They should have plenty of clean water in reach. 
In a few days they will produce eggs.

To fatten Fowls or Chickens in four or five days, 

18. Set rice over the fire with skimmed milk, 
only as much as will serve one day. Let it boil 
till the rice is quite swelled out ; you may add 
a tea-spoonful or two of sugar, but it will do 
well without. Feed them three times a day, in 
common pans, giving them only as much as will 
quite fill them at once. When you put fresh, let 
the pans be set in water, that no sourness may 
be conveyed to the fowls, as that prevents them 
from fattening. Give them clean water, or the 
milk of the rice, to drink ; but the less wet the 
latter is when perfectly soaked, the better. By 
this method the flesh will have a clear whiteness 
which no other food gives. The pen should be 
daily cleaned, and no food given for sixteen 
hours before poultry be killed. 

Feathers. 

14. In towns, poultry being usually sold ready 
picked, the feathers, which may occasionally come 
in f^maXl quantities, are neglected ; but orders 
should be given to put them into a tub free from 
damp, and as they dry to change them into paper 
bags, a few in each : they should hang in a dry 
kitchen to season; fresh ones must not be added 
to those in part dried, or they will occasion a 
musty smell, but they should go through the 
same process. In a few months they will be fit 
to add to beds, or to make pillows, without the 
usual mode of drying in a gently heated oven.

To choose Eggs at Market, and preserve them. 

1 6. Put the large end of the egg to your tongue; 
if it feels warm it is new. In new-laid eggs, there 
is a small division of the skin from the shell, 
which is filled with air, and is preceptible to the 
eye at the end. On looking through them against 
the sua or a candle, if fresh, eggs will be pretty 
clear. If they shake they are not fresh. 

Ducks 

16. Generally begin to lay in the month of 
February. Their eggs should be daily taken 
away, except one, till they seem inclined to sit ; 
then leave them, and see that there are enough. 
They require no attention while sittihg, except 
to give them food at the time they come out to 
seek it ; and there should be water placed at a 
moderate distance from them, that their eggs 
may not be spoiled by their long absence in 
seeking it. Twelve or thirteen are enough ; in 
an early season it is best to set them under a hen. 

Ducks should be accustomed to feed and rest 
at one place, which would prevent their strag- 
gling too far to lay. When to be fattened, they 
must have plenty food, however coarse, and in 
three weeks they will be fat. 

Qeese 

1*7. Require little expense; as they chiefly 
support themselves on commons^ or in lanes* 
where tfiey can get water. The largest are es- 
teemed best, as also are the white and grey. 
Thirty days is generally the time tlio goose sits,

hut in warm weather she will sometimes hatch 
sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded 
bran and light oats ; and as soon as the goslings 
ate hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten 
days, and feed them with barley-meal, bran, 
curds, (fee. For green geese, begin to fatten them 
at six or seven weeks old, and feed them as above. 
Stubble geese require no fattening if they have 
the run of good fields. 

Turkies 

18. Are very tender when young. As soon as 
hatched, put three pepper-corns down their 
throat. Great care is necessary to their well- 
being, because the hen is so careless that she will 
walk about with one chick, and leave the re- 
mainder. Turkies are violent eaters; and must 
be left to themselves, giving them one good feed 
a day. The hen sits twenty-five or thirty days ; 
and the young ones must be kept warm, or the 
least cold or damp kills them. They must be fed 
often ; and at a distance from the hen. They 
should have curds, green cheese pareings cut 
small, and bread and milk with chopped worm- 
wood in it; and their drink sweet milk and 
water. Let the hen be under a coop, in a warm 
place, exposed to the sun, for the first three or 
four weeks ; and the young should not be suffered 
to go out in the dew at morning or evening. 
Twelve eggs are enough to put under a turkey ; 
and when she is about to lay, lock her up till 
she has laid every morning. Fatten them with

sodden oats or barley for the first fortnight ; and 
the last fortnight give them as above, and rice 
swelled with warm milk, over the fire, twice 

ft day. 

Pea Fowls, 

19 Feed these as you do turkies. They are 
80 extremely shy that they are seldom found for 
some days after hatching; and it is ^r^^S^^l 
pursue them, as many people do, m the idea of 
bringing them home, as it only causes the hen to 
carry the young ones through dangerous places, 
and by hurrying she treads upon them. The 
cock kills all the young chickens he can get at,by 
one blow on the centre of the head with his bill ; 
and he does the same by his own brood before 
the feathers of the crown come out. I^ature 
therefore impels the hen to keep them out of his 
way till the feathers rise. 

Guinea Fowl. 

20. Guinea hens lay a great number of eggs ; 
and if you can discover the nest, it is best to put 
tho>m under common hens, who are better nurses. 
Thev require great warmth, quiet and caretul 
feeding, with rice swelled with milk, or bread 
soaked in it. When first hatched, put twopepper- 
corns down their throats.

fed. They should be kept very clean, and the 
bottom of the dovecot be strewed with sand 
once a month at least. Tares and white peas 
are their proper fcod. They should have plenty 
of fresh water in their house. Vermin are their 
great enemies, and destroy them. If the breed 
should be too small, put a few tame pigeons of 
the common kind, and of their own color, among 
them Observe not to have too large a propor- 
tion of cock-birds ; for they are quarrelsome, 
and will soon thin the doveoot. 

Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in 
health. Lay a large heap of clay near the house : 
and let the salt-brine that may be done with in 
the family be poured upon it. , 

Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed is a universal 
remedy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs 
and breasts are sometimes scabby; in which 
case, take a quarter of a pound of bay-salt, and 
as much common salt ; a pound of fennel-seeds, a 
pound of dill-seeds, as much cinnamon-seeds, and 
an ounce of asafoetida; mix all with a little 
wbeaten flour, and some fine worked clay ; when 
all are well beaten together, put it i^^^o t^o 
earthen pots, and bake them in the oven. AVhen 
cold, put them in the dove-cote; the pigeons will 
eat it, and thus be cured.
