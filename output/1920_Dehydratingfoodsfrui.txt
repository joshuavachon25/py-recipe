A FOREWORD 



THE NEW FOOD ECONOMY 

We have passed through a long and trying experi- 
mental stage of saving foods by dehydration. At last, 
means and methods have not only been perfected, but 
are at the service of every one. 

Dehydration may be accomplished easily and suc- 
cessfully, both in the kitchen and in commercial plants, 
— by the bushel or by the ton, as the case may be. 

For several years patient and unceasing work has 
been done along this line in order to attain the desired 
results, and personally I acknowledge with grateful 
appreciation the kindly co-operation and suggestions 
from Messrs. George Hillard Benjamin, O. H. Benson, 
Woodford Brooks, Joseph S. Caldwell, H. C. Gore, 
S. C. Prescott, Lou D. Sweet, the late Waldron 
Williams, F. G. Wiechmann and other sincere and 
able investigators. 

Moreover, in writing upon the development of de- 
hydration in the United States, it is only just to pay a 
sincere tribute to the altruistic and laudable efforts 
of Mrs. Oliver Harriman in behalf of this beneficent 
work.

DEHYDRATING FOODS 



CHAPTER I 

REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

The dehydration of foods is one of the most im- 
portant considerations in the world. It is the means of 
preserving foods quickly, cheaply and perfectly, and it 
will save thousands of tons of garden, orchard and farm 
produce which have gone to waste hitherto. 

By dehydration, all kinds of foods — fish, meats, 
fruits and vegetables, and even milk and eggs — may 
be reduced to a fraction of their original weight and 
bulk. Moreover, when properly dehydrated, the foods 
maintain not only their nutritive properties, but their 
flavorings and colorings as well, being far superior to 
canned products in this regard. 

Those of us who have worked practically at dehydra- 
tion and with dehydrated products realize, that this 
art or science is bound to effect a revolution in our 
means and methods of food preservation, and interest 
in dehydration and appreciation of its possibilities are 
spreading rapidly throughout tl^e world. 

During my lectures upon foods and cookery during 
the past two years most of the questions coming from 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

the audiences were about dehydration, or "drying" 
as the majority consider it, while I have people calling 
at my testing kitchen almost daily regarding systems 
and methods, among them being visitors from Cuba, 
South American countries, Italy, France, Great Britain 
and Canada, in addition to those from all over the 
United States. 

There is a very essential di£Perence between drying 
and dehydration, and this fact must be recognized. 
As we know, all food materials are composed of myriads 
of tiny cells, these cells holding flavorings, colorings 
and nutrients, together with a large percentage of 
fluid — practically water. The problem has been how 
to extract the water from the cells without causing 
chemical changes and loss of essential principles. 

Broadly speaking, dehydration is a method of ex- 
tracting the water quickly without rupturing the mem- 
branes or cell walls. Thus only the water is taken away, 
and the volatiles, the flavoring essences, the colorings 
and the nutritive properties are left in the cells. It is 
just the principle of osmosis (a sweating, as it may be 
termed), and when the dehydrated or dehumidified 
products are soaked in water for a time their cells 
absorb moisture, and furnish, to all intents and pur- 
poses, fresh food materials which may be cooked and 
dealt with just as could, be the original raw foods. 

Drying, on the other hand, is a slow process, — so 
slow that the cell walls crack and open, allowing the 
volatiles and aromatics to escape and the coloring prin- 
ciples to change; hence the flavor and appearance of 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

dried products are not and cannot be equal to those of 
dehydrated products. 

As tangible evidence of this we will consider grass 
and hay. Hay is dried grass, and even though you 
soak hay in water you cannot "restore" it, whereas 
dehydrated grass "comes back" fresh, green and succu- 
lent. 

Let us take dried apples as another example. Dried 
apple pie is always dried apple pie, as every one can 
tell upon tasting it, whereas pie made from dehydrated 
apples yields a dish that is really fresh apple pie, and 
it cannot be distinguished from pie made with the 
fresh-cut fruit. 

To emphasize still further the conspicuous merits 
of dehydrated fruits and vegetables, I have often 
served dehydrated products and strictly fresh ones at 
the same meal, and no one could tell which was which. 
Recently a food commissioner from a neighboring coun- 
try wrote to ask me what I thought of dehydration, and 
what plant or system of dehydration could I recom- 
mend. I replied that the subject was too important to 
deal with satisfactorily by correspondence, but that 
if he would call at my testing kitchen in New York he 
could see my exhibit of dehydrated products, — fish, 
oysters, meats and ahnost every fruit and vegetable 
grown in the United States, and that we could then 
discuss the technical details of dehydration to good 
advantage. 

This man came and brought another food official 
with him, whereupon I prepared a luncheon at which 

3 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

were served fresh-picked carrots, spinach, turnips and 
cabbage, the latter chopped finely and served raw with 
a dressing, as cabbage salad. At the meal I served the 
same things dehydrated, the carrots and spinach having 
been dehydrated a couple of years previously. My 
guests confessed that they could not tell which were the 
fresh vegetables and which were the dehydrated ones. 
Finally, one of them said, "Oh, Mrs. Andrea can 
make anything taste good," but while I appreciated 
the compliment, I protested very promptly, saying 
that he was not being fair to dehydrated products, 
because all can cook and serve dehydrated products 
that will be just as delicious as fresh-picked stuff, 
provided that they will follow simple rules and direc- 
tions. And, as it happened, m this particular instance 
my maid had prepared everything under my directions, 
so the whole thing was really a sincere tribute to 
dehydration. 

As drying is a more convenient term to use, we will 
consider it for our purpose herein as dehydration, desic- 
cation or dehumidifying; consequently, when the word 
"drying" is used it is to be understood in its restricted 
sense. 

I have tested samples of dehydrated fruits and 
vegetables from Denmark, Germany, Russia and other 
European countries, but find that over there they 
precook everything before dehydrating it. This means 
a great loss in flavor and appearance, and when the 
precooking has involved a boiling process a large per- 
centage of the valuable nutrients and solubles escape

ji 



REGAKDING DEHYDRATION 

into the water, with consequent and material loss of 
desirable properties. 

We have improved vastly over the European meth- 
ods, for we dehydrate most of our produce raw, with 
few exceptions, such as potato, beets and com, the 
latter being steamed only long enough to set the milk. 

Just a word of caution will be it propos here. There 
is dehydration and what many people mistake for 
dehydration, the latter being improperly and imper- 
fectly done. The produce must be dried "below the 
enzyme stage" and throitghovi; uniformly from centre 
to surface. That is to say, there must not be enough 
moisture left to permit of fermentation or mold, but 
at the same time there must be a sufficient percentage 
of moisture left in the products so that they will 
"restore" as they should. 

Already, many people have met with disastrous losses 
through trying to put dehydrated products on the 
market in packages, without realizing the importance 
of the foregoing. The products molded and spoiled, 
and in many cases developed grub worms and insects, 
all of which meant loss and disappointment to the 
packers, and distrust of dehydrated products on the 
part of the public. 

This need not be a source of discouragement, however, 
for proper dehydration and treatment of the products 
overcome these troubles, and we must remember that 
when canned foods were first put on the market, con- 
stant spoilage and loss occurred until the packers 
learned the means and methods now employed by them. 



DEHYDRATING POODS 

Of course, reasonable care must be exercised in regard 
to keeping foods that have been dehydrated, for nothing 
in Nature will stand abuse or mistreatment. As an 
instance of this I was once called into consultation with 
some people who were putting out dehydrated milk 
(milk powders) on a large scale. They were having 
Constant trouble with their customers, with bakers 
especially, who claimed that while they realized what 
milk powders could do when used in their bread, cake 
and other mixtures, the powders became rancid and 
unusable, so that they would not experiment with them 
any farther. Upon visiting these dissatisfied bakers 
I found that after having purchased the powdered 
milk in barrel lots they were keeping these barrels 
open, and close to radiators, ovens and other sources 
of heat, so no wonder rancidity and spoilage ensued. 

When this little matter of cause and effect was 
pointed out, and their future supplies were kept in 
dry, cool and suitable places, no further complaints 
were received, and the business has grown to enormous 
proportions. 

In concluding this chapter I would say that while 
those who have worked with ddliydration, and have 
used properly dehydrated products, become enthusiaatic 
converts to this form of food preservation, as the sub- 
ject is so new and as yet comparatively little known, 
I will now quote statements regarding dehydration 
from various authorities in support of my own views 
and claims.

REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

General Realization coming 

As a people we have not yet realized that for many decades 
we have been paying millions of dollars annually for water 
that we did not want, — water that we might just as easily 
have had well-nigh for nothing, by working the pimip or 
turning on the faucet. 

Take, for instance, a case of canned tomatoes costing about 
$4 and containing two dozen tins, each weighing 2 pounds. 
The canner's outlay for the tomatoes themselves did not ex- 
ceed 15 cents. In other words, the ultimate consumer is 
spending $3.85 for 15 cents worth of tomatoes, and probably 
full 90 per cent of each 2-pound can is tin and water — 
mostly water. 

The economic wastage becomes still more conspicuous 
when you realize that a tax in the way of freight chiarges is 
being levied for the transportation of every pound of that 
water, and of the cans and boxes that make it possible to 
ship the tomatoes in that form. The canned tomato is no 
whit more palatable or nourishing than its dried rival. The 
24-can case tips the scales at 60 pounds, while the same 
qiiantity of the vegetable when dried weighs only %i pounds, 
and can be packed in pasteboard containers. 

Probably the sacrifices due to the water content of the 
canned product can be made even plainer. It is practicable 
to ship dried in 1 car what it would take 80 cars to carry of 
the canned goods. In a carload of canned tomatoes there are 
10,000 pounds of tin and 14,000 pounds of lumber, a total of 
24,000 pounds, and for SO cars freight would have to be paid 
on 860 tons of materiab that could in no wise help the hungry 
consumer. An expert has further elaborated upon the wastage 
and lost motion involved. He says: *' There is the movement 
of the tm-making material from the mines to the tin-plate 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

factory, and the movement of the tin plate from the tin- 
plate factory to the tin-can plant; and the movement of the 
logs to the sawmill and of the lumber thence to the box 
shook works, and the shooks from there to the cannery. The 
aggregate of this service gives us 105 carloads as against 1 
carload of dried vegetables." The cardboard containers 
are made from waste material, and the cartons, folded flat, 
capable of holding a carload of desiccated vegetables, can be 
carried in a very small space. 

Last year we raised 400,106,000 bushels of potatoes, and 
from government sources we learn that only about 82 per 
cent of our total potato crop ever moves out of the territory 
in which the tubers are grown. A staggering percentage of 
the potatoes are scrapped or fed to cattle simply because they 
are not first class, measured by market standards, or it is 
impossible to ship them away to other districts for human 
consumption. 

The potato is 78 per cent water in its edible portion. In 
Germany they dried in the course of twelve months, according 
to the latest available reports, 800,000,000 bushels, sub- 
stantially twice as many potatoes as we raise in the whole 
United States annually. Every pound of those desiccated 
potatoes was 100 per cent foodstuff, and could be kept many 
months without deterioration. This was apart from the 
potatoes which were utilized in the ordinary fresh condition. 

Again, for fresh vegetables shipped long distances we pay 
extravagantly. This is to cover spoiling in transit or pres- 
ervation while on the road, besides taking care of the trans- 
portation charges. A western grower urged Congress about 
a year ago to take steps to promote dehydration in this 
country. According to him: ''Just before I left California 
I. saw a shipment of 50 pounds of green sprouts about to be 
despatched to some point east where the express rate is 

8 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

12 cents a pound. In order to ship that 50 pounds of green 
sprouts they had to include a 100-pound cake of ice, and 
to pay on that ice at the same rkte, making a total express 
outlay of $18. The whole 50 pounds could have been dried 
and mailec} by parcel post, the package weighing 3 pounds 
and calling for S5 cents in stamps." — The Sun, New York. 

The United States Department of Agriculture informs us 
that fully 50 per cent of all the vegetables and fruits grown in 
America never reach the consumer. They rot on the ground. 

This tremendous loss is due to difficulties of transportation 
combined with the fact that only the fanciest quality of 
fruits and vegetables will pass final market inspection for 
profitable shipping and trading. 

The American dehydrating processes now encouraged 
would conserve every particle of these waste products, con- 
tributing tremendously thereby to the wealth of the farm, 
and adding thousands of tons of perfect foods to the nation's 
dietary. 

The value of vegetables and fruits because of their flavor, 
fiber and indispensable alkaline salts is recognized by scien- 
tists all over the world. Their use is essential to the physical 
welfare of soldiers, sailors and civilians. 

In the dehydrated products the food elements, the al- 
bumens, starches, sugars, fats, oil and salts suffer no impair- 
ment of their food value. The food cells and cell membranes 
are not injured, but retain their normal function. 

The dehydrated product after immersion in water resumes 
its original freshness and appearance, retains its original 
coloring principles, its essential oils and other volatile con- 
stituents. 

The drying process so imprisons the delicate bouquet and 
the fine flavor of the raspberry that the manufacturers of 

9 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

pure fruit extracts actually prefer the dehydrated berry to 
the fresh berry. The reason for this is very simple. The 
extract manufacturer has to wait from two to five days after 
the berry is picked before he can put his hands upon it. On 
the other hand, when picked fresh and put into the dehydrat- 
ing machine right on the farm or in a near-by plant the full 
flavor and bouquet of the berry is sealed up at once and 
remains sealed up until it is again released by its bath in 
cold water before cooking. 

What is true with regard to the raspberry is also true with 
regard to apples, apricots, figs, peaches, pears, plums, cherries, 
quinces, strawberries, blackberries, huckleberries, currants, 
grapes, rhubarb, tomatoes, eggplant, squash, pumpkin, com, 
peas, mushrooms, string beans, horseradbh, herbs, etc. — 
The Globe, New Yobk. 

Dehy(h'ation is the science of removing water from vege- 
tables and fruits. There are two methods, — the German, 
which cooks the vegetable with live steam before drying, to 
break down the starch cells, and the American, which dries 
by passing hot air over the product. There is no loss of taste, 
color or food value with the American process. Virtually 
all fruits and vegetables can be dehydrated and they will 
keep indefinitely. — General Facts about Dehydbation, 

PUBLISHED BY THE FoOD FOR FRANCE FUND, NeW YoBK 
CiTT. 

In order that the layman may realize something of what 
dehydration involves, it might be well to show how large a 
part water plays in some staple fruits and vegetables. Let 
us tabulate these for easier reference.

The housewife pays for all of this water at exactly the 
same rate per pound as she does for the food content. Fur- 
thermore, the nutritive value of dried fruits and vegetables 
increases directly as the percentage of water diminishes. 
Plainly we are dietary spendthrifts when we insist upon 
fresh produce, and it is evident that we can effect a very 
handsome saving if we will content ourselves in the cold 
seasons with dehydrated products. 

By the latest American process the products to be dried 
are commonly treated within a very few hours after they 
have been gathered; in fact, they reach the so-called dry- 
ventors far fresher than most of us know such commodities. 
We have to wait at times days before they come to the table, 
and nearly every hour after picking there is measurable 
deterioration and loss of flavor. 

The ultimate products when soaked in water, as they 
should be for a short time before cooking, regain their original 
form, and taste as crisp and fresh and full-flavored as though 



11 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

newly gathered. Of course, the dried foodstuffs occupy but 
a small part of the space taken up by the original fresh 
produce. 

For example, a barrel of dried mixed vegetables that will 
make first-class soup weighs but 100 pounds and will provide 
a steaming plate for 7,000 persons. Before drying, these 
vegetables fill something like 80 barrels. This saving in 
weight and bulk is a matter of especial importance now be- 
cause of car shortage and railway congestion. — The 
Herald, New Yobk. 

And the weight of expert opinion is emphatically that we 
are about to decide in favor of a revolution; that we are 
about to institute a change in our mechanism of food supply 
more fundamental in its nature, and more far-reaching ih its 
results, than anything since the invention of the tin can 
itself. We are going to discard the whole elaborate system 
of preserving our food in condition to eat; instead of wetting 
it down and cooking it before preservation, we are going to 
dry it out thoroughly, and, in all but a few cases, preserve it 
raw. Dehydration is the word. — American Cookery, Bos- 
ton, Mass. 

And last, but not least, there are various types of dryers 
for home use, so that the housekeeper can see and learn how 
to dry or dehydrate her fruits and vegetables so that they 
can be "restored" by simply soaking in water at any time 
during the winter. The original orchard and garden fresh 
flavors and colors will be in them to perfection, for proper 
drying means that merely the water content has been removed 
without rupturing the cell walls or changing the flavors, 
colors and nutritive properties. It is a pleasant considera- 
tion that no winter day can prove so cold and dreary but 
that you can have the cheer and good things of summer time

on the home table by means of dehydrated products. — The 
TaiBUKEy New Yobk. 

The one great lesson taught by the special instruction train 
to promote food preservation, which was visited by himdreds 
of persons last evening at the Erie station, is that of dehy- 
drating foods. Everything from peas to prunes, including to- 
matoes, asparagus, spinach, carrots, beans, pineapple, squash, 
can be dehydrated to advantage, eliminating the need for 
tin cans, glass jars and sugar, and absolutely doing away 
with the waste resulting from ''spoiled" jars. 

Absolutely every bit of the dried fruits and vegetables in 
the train had been " put up " by Mrs. A. Louise Andrea. Mrs. 
Andrea received first prize for everything she canned and 
preserved at the San Francisco fair. Mrs. Andrea spoke 
informally to the groups of interested women who gathered 
around her» answered questions, and explained many of 
her little discoveries which make her work so successful. — 
The News, Newbxtboh, N. Y. 

Drying of garden products, however, is going to make the 
amount of food stored away for next winter's use much 
larger than it would be otherwise. This old-new idea of 
food drying has taken forcible hold of the American people. 
Revived at this time of imperative need, it has appealed to 
every one through its practicability. Food so prepared is 
wholesome, palatable and extremely cheap. From being the 
preoccupation of scientists, the subject of food drying has 
come to be, next to the war itself, the biggest topic of the 
day. 

Mr. Lou D. Sweet, president of the Potato Association of 
America, says on this subject: ''Dehydration has come to 
stay in this country, and those who are familiar with the 
problem of food production and conservation are firm in the 

13 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

opinion that ve are seeing only the beginning of what is sure 
to expand into an enormous and important industry. Every 
encouragement, therefore, should be given to home drying, 
in order that the people nmy become familar with the excel- 
lence of the products which may be prepared by this method, 
and to save the vast quantities of excellent food which goes 
to waste for lack of adequate means of conservation."-^ 
Chables Lathbop Pack, President, National War Gab- 
den COMMISBION. 

A single pound of dried tomatoes or cabbage is equal to 
10 pounds of the fresh vegetable, and at least that number 
of pounds of the canned. A paper carton of dried tomatoes, 
no larger than a package of breakfast food, and weighing 
2} pounds, is equivalent, in food values, to an entire case 
of canned tomatoes, containing two dozen cans, weighing 
60 pounds. When cooked, each will make the same volume 
of food. 

The use of dried vegetables in caf^, hotels and clubs 
carries with it many advantages. It enables the chef to 
have on hand, at aU times and to meet any emergency de- 
mand, a supply of all varieties of vegetables. The compact- 
ness and lightness of these dried vegetables avoids the ne- 
cessity of maintaining large storage rooms, often refrigerated, 
for a tin of dried vegetables weighing 10 poimds, and occupy- 
ing less than 2 cubic feet of space, will provide enough food 
for a thousand persons at one meal. As the food is non- 
perishable, it can be carried on the pantry shelves indefi- 
nitely without deterioration, and when wanted for use the 
soaking of a few handf uls in water will render the vegetable 
ready for cooking. 

Practically every variety of fresh vegetable is now being 
successfully dried. In the big drying plants on the Pacific 

14 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

coast all kinds of vegetables, berries and fruits are de- 
hydrated. 

The best proof of the utility of evaporated vegetables is 
shown by the kind of institutions which use them. Famous 
hoteb, clubs and caf^ from Maine to California are using 
them regukirly in their service, and many of the leading 
chefs of the country have testified to the merits of the new 
form of food. In New York the Manhattan and Ritz-Carlton 
hotels use evaporated vegetables, and the same is true of the 
Willard in Washington, the Palace and St. Francis in San 
Francisco, and many others throughout the country. An 
equally large list of prominent clubs and caf6s have become 
converted to the new product. 

The owners of ocean-going vessels are abo becoming in- 
terested in evaporated vegetables for use in feeding the 
passengers and crews during a voyage. The great saving 
in space, their wide variety, and other advantages have led 
some of the large operating companies on the Pacific coast 
to try out the products, and all of them report the results as 
being most satisfactory. — Thb Stewabd, New Yobk. 

The advantages of dehydration are almost too obvious to 
require extended statement. Most evident of all is the loss 
in weight. All the vegetables in common use contain from 
^5 to 95 per cent of water. The dehydrated product made 
from these vegetables should contain from 5 to 10 per cent 
of water. There is, therefore, a very large reduction in 
weight and consequent saving in the transportation charges, 
which in general are based upon weight. 

Similarly there is a loss in bulk amounting to from 50 to 
80 per cent of the bulk of the raw material. The importance 
of these factors to railroads in times of congestion such as 
we have just passed through, or to ships in overseas service, 

15 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

is very evident. In the mere matter of sending food to 
armies, one ship could easily carry the vegetable requirements 
which in the green or fresh state would take from 10 to ^ 
ships. 

From the standpoint of agriculture the greatest advantage 
of dehydration undoubtedly appears in the stabilization of 
crops and the conservation of materials. Under the present 
conditions we are confronted by either a feast or a famine. 
If we consider potatoes as the most typical root crop, it is a 
matter of experience that a year in which we get a very large 
harvest and consequently low prices is likely to be followed 
by a lean year with a small crop and high prices. This 
pendulum swing goes on decade after decade. With de- 
hydration the excess of the years of great yield can be stored 
up and made available in the following year, when prices 
are higher and the crop much smaller. After a short time 
this would tend to equalize the amount of planting, and, 
other things being equal, to give us year by year a sufficient 
quantity of food materials at normal prices. 

The second great advantage is in the conservation of food 
materials. It is estimated that over 50 per cent of the fruits 
and vegetables grown in this coimtry now never reach the 
consumer, as a result of poor transportation facilities, irregu- 
larities in marketing or other causes. By making use of the 
process of dehydration the second quality materials could 
be preserved by drying, and made available for human 
food and not allowed to rot and waste, ' Again, taking the 
potato as typical, those of classes 2 and 3 (culls) could be 
used for the manufacture of dehydrated potato and potato 
flour, a product which has not yet received in this country 
the attention which it deserves, but which is now being 
manufactured to some extent in a number of different parts 
of the country. 

16 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

A third factor of importance in the relation of dehydration 
to agriculture lies in the fact that a better diversity of crops 
can be secured, and as a result of this there will be a good 
variety of the vegetables which are the equivalent of fresh 
materials available to poor and rich throughout the year. 
This means practically better feeding for the people at large, 
evening up of prices, and the prevention of famine or great 
food shortage as a result of poor crops in any particular 
location. — Maj. S. C. Fbescott, United States Depabt- 

MENT OF AgBICXTLTURE. 

Dehydration of fruits and vegetables is a field offering great 
possibilities, once processes have been developed to make 
good products. Millions of pounds of water are being carried 
about in this country every day in freight cars at high rates, 
in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables. The water not 
only costs consumers millions of dollars in freight and bulk, 
but is the chief factor in decay and freezing. By good proc- 
esses of dehydration, which are now being perfected, apples 
and berries can be made dry as chips, and potatoes and 
cabbage likewise. A bushel of potatoes in the form of dried 
flakes can be carried home under your arm in a tin can. No 
peeling, no freezing, no decay, no waste. MiUions of pounds 
of such potatoes were dehydrated in America and sent to the 
Allies. In a little tin you will soon buy mixtures of dehydrated 
vegetables, six or eight different kinds, for soup. — The 
Satubdat Evening Pobt. 

I am deeply interested in the industry of desiccated vege- 
tables and fruits. I believe that the general use of such 
products by the general public would be highly beneficial. 
The rapidity with which the samples are dried and the low 
temperature employed secure the full value of these products 

17 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

in SO far as their vitamine and antiscorbutic properties are 
concerned. — Db. Harvey W. Wiley. 

In my opinion, gathered from my own experiments and 
the evidence gathered in Germany, the food values of dried 
vegetables remain the same as fresh. Regarding the so- 
called vitamines, the leaf v^etables, such as cabbage, spin- 
ach and cauliflower, contain more than do the fruits and 
other vegetables, but owing to the high prices in wintertime 
the consumer with a limited pocketbook is going to buy 
the grain products he considers essential and cut out these 
green leaf vegetables. This is a great mistake. Children par- 
ticularly, and even the grown-ups, need this particular sub- 
stance which occurs in largest amount in these green vege- 
tables which will not be bought by consumers during the 
high-priced season, hence my great interest in the possibility 
of converting these leaf vegetables during the season when 
they are very cheap into an imperishable commodity which 
everybody can buy when fresh vegetables are too expen- 
sive in the winter season. — Pbofebbob McCollitm of 

ROCKEFELLEB INSTITUTE OF HyGIENE.

CHAPTER II 

USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

As intimated previously, almost everything which 
may be eaten can be dehydrated. As a matter of 
fact, I have succeeded with everything but watermelon, 
in which the percentage of moisture is so excessive and 
the cellular structure so delicate that I must exclude 
watermelon from the practicabilities, albeit the rind 
may be dehydrated for future use in pickles and con- 
serves. While it would seem that the tomato comes 
in the "impossible" category, nevertheless, the tomato 
can be dehydrated to good advantage, in quarters if 
the tomatoes are small, or sliced, and then ground 
into powder, if desired, the latter being the best for 
soups and sauces. Directions for making these are 
given elsewhere in this volume. 

Whether for commercial purposes or for home use, 
it must be realized that through dehydration the 
finest and freshest of farm and garden produce is 
always available for the bleak winter months, and 
for use where such produce cannot be grown. One 
can have young, tender beans, fresh peas, sweet com, 
succulent, tender spinach, tropical dainties and a 
multitude of other food things at any time during 
the winter, and at any place whatever, all preserved 
at their freshest and best, and when cheap and plenti- 
ful. In fact, in many districts produce develops so 

19 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

rapidly and in such abundance during the summer that 
it can be often had for the mere picking, and those 
having farms and gardens may dehydrate in their 
kitchens such small amounts of fruits and vegetables 
as it would not pay to put up by a canning process, 
but which can be saved to perfection and without cost 
by simply using a little home dehydrator over a kitchen 
range. 

Those intending to do dehydration on a commercial 
scale are naturally interested in the possible sources 
oi their raw materials and markets for the finished 
goods. I do not think that at first it would be advisable 
to try to sell small package lots to housewives and 
famiUes, for the time and expense involved would 
hardly warrant this. Worth-while quantities may be 
easily sold to hotels, restaurants, clubs, camps, board- 
ing schools, hospitals and other institutions, however, 
and to the supply departments of railroads, steamships 
and saiHng vessels. The advantages of such products 
are so many and so obvious that but little salesmanship 
is necessary, for it is a matter of obtaining fresh produce 
which is already cleaned and ready for use, which takes 
up little storage space, and at a positive saving of 
cost and labor to the purchasers. 

The tremendous reduction in space and weight is 
all-important as far as dining cars and ships are con- 
cerned. Many of the latter heretofore have been 
going without fresh fruits and vegetables on account 
of lack of room and refrigeration, to the detriment of 
both passengers and crews*. But where a truck load 

20 



USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

of good, fresh produce has been reduced to a mere 
case or barrel, all the previous objections are done 
away with, and dehydrated fruits and vegetables will 
be carried and served, thus preventing scurvy and 
other ailments, and adding materially to the health, 
efficiency and happiness of all concerned. 

To prove my point I am constantly receiving letters 
asking where good dehydrated products can be secured. 
The following, from one of the largest corporations in 
the United States, is an example: — 

Deab Mrs. Andrea: — We are operating a large con- 
cession in South America, and are obliged to transport to 
our workers there commissary supplies. These have to go 
up a long river in gasoline boats and then on mule back. It 
has occurred to us that we might use to advantage dehydrated 
vegetables in this connection, and write you, as we under- 
stand that you have done a great deal of work in connection 
with the dehydration of vegetables, to ask if you can inform 
us the name and address of manufacturers of best grade of 
these products. We will greatly appreciate any information 
you can give us. 

Other profitable channels are opening up, such as 
the furnishing of basic materials for jams, jellies, 
syrups and extracts, for the fruits employed therein 
may be dehydrated and set aside to be used when 
convenient, and the resultant products are in no wise 
inferior to those made from the fresh fruits. 

There is no need of worry as to the outcome of 
a dehydration business, properly conducted. In the 
first place, it is dealing with a necessary factor in 

21 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

my eidiibit I have an ordinary can of spinach which 
contains 1 pound and 14 ounces, as printed on the 
label according to legal requirements. It is a large 
can, No. 8 size, and adjoining it I have a tiny can of 
dehydrated spinach which contains just as much of 
the actual vegetable as the large can does. This shows 
at a glance the astonishing difference in size, bulk and 
weight between canned and dehydrated goods. More- 
over, the dehydrated spinach, like, other foods pre- 
served in this manner, may be kept in a paper bag, a 
cardboard box, jar or other receptacle. The canned 
spinach contains a very large percentage of water, 
which the consumer must pay for, whereas for de- 
hydrated spinach the chef or housekeeper simply 
draws the water from a faucet or well, adding it as 
desired. Furthermore, when the ordinary can of 
spinach has been opened its entire contents must be 
used up quickly or they will si>oil, whereas with the 
dehydrated spinach a woman can use any portion she 
pleases, according to the needs of the moment, and 
the rest will keep for some future occasion. I have a 
stock of dehydrated spinach which has been in a 
cardboard container for three years, and it still comes 
back and cooks up perfectly. 

Following this subject of spinach still further, there 
is another advantage of the dehydrated as against the 
basket of fresh spinach for the hotel man or housewife. 
When one buys a basket of spinach there come with 
it roots, dirt and usually many decayed leaves, with 
weeds thrown in for good measure occasionally. Last, 

24 



USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 



but not least, there is the arduous and disagreeable 
task of picking the spinach over, selecting the edible 
portions and then washing them, and unless washed 
very thoroughly .and in a certain way the spinach 
will be gritty when it goe3 on the table. So, in addi- 
tion to the labor involved, by the time the spinach has 
been picked and washed a large portion of it has 
been rejected, whereas the dehydrated product comes 
picked over, cleaned and in compact form all ready 
to cook, for spinach does not need any soaking in 
order to restore it, but the necessary water can be 
added and the cooking proceeded with immediately. 

To further exemplify how dried foods save space, 
glass and tin here are the results of some tests made 
in the Tribune Laboratory: —

Where it is intended to market the products in

amples of trade names there are registered and in use

CHAPTER ni 

FOR PETS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS 

Our bird and animal friends and their owners will 
profit through this new method of preserving grasses, 
herbs, fruits and vegetables. 

As I have already stated, grass can be dehydrated 
and then restored to excellent condition. This will 
be welcome news to many people who have pet cats, 
especially to those living in places where the animals 
are deprived of outdoor exercise and such pasturage 
as even cats love and can obtain here and there in 
winter. To be perfectly healthy a cat needs a little 
grass at times and an occasional morsel of catnip or 
some other herb. 

I have made many cats and their owners happy 
through a Uttle present of some dehydrated grass 
and dehydrated catnip. The grass allowed to soak 
for a couple of hours looks, and doubtless tastes, 
like June grass. Certainly the cats appreciate it, and 
as for the spray of catnip dehydrated and then re- 
stored, the little animals' relish of it is very agreeable 
to behold. 

The same thing holds true with herbs. These have 
a fragrance, flavor and value such as many of the old 
dried herbs cannot possibly furnish, and while i have 
not taken up, as yet, the subject of dehydratea herbs 

26 



FOR ANIMALS 

for general medicinal use» I am satisfied that here is a 
big and profitable field. 

Speaking of grass and other green f odder, it is true 
that silos give many farmers, stock raisers and dairy- 
men an invaluable adjunct. At the same time, there 
are thousands of men owning horses, cows and other 
animals who cannot avail themselves of ensilage, and 
whose animals must sorely miss a taste of green food 
during the long winter months, and really suffer for 
want of it. 

A stock of dehydrated grass, green com leaves, pea 
pods, turnip-tops and the like would not only be of 
practical value but a real kindness to the animals for 
whose care, comfort and happy condition the owner 
is responsible. 

It is astonishing what a considerable amount of green 
fodder can be reduced to an infinitesimal compass and 
stored in any convenient place, even in a cold building, 
for dehydrated products will not freeze. A Uttle of this 
fodder steeped in tepid water for a short time will be a 
most welcome treat, and will tend toward preventing 
many ailments animals are subject to that are fed 
exclusively upon dried food. 

This brings up a very important potential proposi- 
tion of salvage, utilizing to good purpose pea pods, 
cauliflower leaves and other rejects from canning 
plants and elsewhere. Of course, when considering 
the use of such rejects it is necessary to be assured that 
no disinfectant has been thrown on them, for this is 
sometimes practiced in the case of heaps of outer 

27 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

leaves of vegetables and whatnot in order to prevent 
flies and odors. 

In this connection it is well known how much better 
off hens and chickens are if fed green stuff from time 
to time, whether egg production has to be considered 
or the marketing of poultry for table use. Here is a 
convenient and economical means of adding to the 
poultry rations, not only grass and other leaves, but 
an occasional meal of vegetables, the culls and un- 
marketable produce being useful in this way. When 
dehydrating, however, only fresh and sound stuff 
must be used. Badly wilted or decomposed parts will 
spoil the entire output; but as intimated, vegetables 
too small to market, or that cannot be shipped profit- 
ably in their heavy raw state, may be put to good use 
in this and other ways. 



28 



CHAPTER IV 

DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

We will now consider dehydration in commercial 
or community plants. Such plants have been and are 
being established all over the United States and in 
other countries as well, and various types of dehy- 
drators are being used, — tunnel, kiln and chamber 
driers, some of the latter being portable and others 
equipped with traveling belts instead of trays, this 
with a view to doing away with labor in handUng and 
thereby reducing cost. 

As regards the commercial proposition, markets and 
sales require particularly careful consideration. 

A community plant may be conducted on a co-op- 
erative basis, with the idea of supplying local families 
with fruits and vegetables for home use, the idea 
being always to take advantage of summer low prices 
and abundance as against scarcity and high prices 
during winter. 

People bring their produce to the community plant 
where it is treated, either for a cash consideration or 
for a percentage of the produce itself. That is to say, a 
certain portion of everything bought is retained in the 
community plant to pay its operating expenses, and 
the balance returned to the farmer or producer who 
brings it in to be dehydrated. The patrons are en- 
couraged, and in some instances required, to bring 

29 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

their fruits and vegetables peeled and cut, or otherwise 
prepared before bringing them to the dehydrator. 
The objection to this is, however, the rapid deteriora- 
tion of materials after the protective skins have been 
removed and the cut surfaces exposed. For this 
reason it is better to have peelers and cutters available 
at the plant. And, once for all, the produce must be 
sound and as fresh as possible. Dehydration will not 
save "turned" or decomposed materials. 

Where the community plant is conducted in an 
ordinary business way the products are sold and a 
division of profits is made, pro rata, with the stock- 
holders, as in any other business, the stockholders 
in this case buying whatever they need from the com- 
munity plant and paying for it just as every one else 
would. In addition to this, if local producers are 
interested in the plant financially, it will tend toward 
assurance of raw material, both as to quality and 
regular supply. 

The managers of community plants, however, must 
assure themselves that those interested fully ap- 
preciate how much raw materials shrink when dehy- 
drated, otherwise there is apt to be suspicion and dis- 
satisfaction. 

People must realisse, for example, that a pound of 
fresh carrots comes down to % oimces or less upon 
being prepared and dehydrated, it being remembered 
that part of the loss is caused through cleaning and 
peeling, and, with many things, through necessary 
rejection of bruised surfaces. The same reasoning 

30 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

applies to pod and leaf vegetables, so it is not only 
advisable but necessary to give ocular demonstration 
and proof at the very outset. 

Many systems of dehydration are being exploited 
just at present, '*most of them bad/' as one of the 
foremost experts in the country said to me. 

Dehydration seems so simple and so easy at the 
first glance that many people have gone into the busi- 
ness without due consideration or adequate knowledge. 
Experience shows them, however, that there is a lot 
to learn and many factors to take into account. Hence 
they have obtained consequences instead of results. 

There are different qualities of dehydration, — poor, 
better and best. The first test of a dehydrated product 
is its keeping quaUty, and then, all-important to the 
consumer, how it restores and tastes when served. 
Poorly dehydrated products will not keep long; fur- 
thermore, they take too much time to restore (even 
when they will restore at all), and are then insipid and 
inferior in flavor* In fact, I have countless specimens 
of so-called dehydrated stuff which has been both 
brought and sent to me to find out why it would not 
come back, or why it quickly molded. If overdried 
or dried too slowly the cell walls have been ruptured, 
chemical changes have taken place, and in many in- 
stances an actual cooking has resulted, usually because 
too high a temperature has been employed or too 
much time has been consumed in the process. As for 
the molding, this is generally caused by the inner 
cells retaining too much moisture, and here is one of 

31 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

the points regarding which many dehydrators go 
wrong, as I will explain presently. 
f I obtain the best results by starting the dehydration 
I at a relatively low temperature, and I insure a perfect 
1 product by having a certain amount of moisture in 
the dehydrator at first. Relatively good products 
may be obtained without the employment of such 
moisture, or through a one-temperature drying, but 
some initial moisture and raising of temperature will 
be necessary to obtain perfect results, and here is the 
reason. If raw materiab are subjected immediately 
to a high, dry temperature there is a very rapid evap- 
oration from the surface or superficial cells, which 
**skin dries" the material, forming practically a glaze 
or coating which prevents the inner cells from liberating 
^ their moisture as they should do. Consequently when 
the product is apparently dehydrated, the inner cells 
still contain too much moisture, and are still subject 
to enzymic action, besides which this moisture exuding 
later on will furnish a dampness sufficient to allow 
of the superficial molding which has given so many 
people such trouble and loss. At one time hot dry 
air was considered so necessary that attempts were 
made to eliminate moisture from the air by passing it 
through or over some hygroscopic substance such as 
calcium chloride or sulphuric acid, or by heat-drying 
the air before it was admitted to the drying chamber, 
but such methods proved fallacious besides adding 
to the operating costs. 
Dehydration is such a new subject that it is difficult 

32 



II 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

to find a standard or basis of agreement upon all points 
among those who are experimenting with it. But with 
all due deference to contrary opinions, and after 
having carefully tested many systems and worked 
with the subject for some years, I am able to secure 
the best results by observing the following rules: to 
use radiate heat rather than direct heat; to start 
with the lowest temperature necessary and finish with 
the highest temperature suitable. And, by the way, 
times and temperatures vary for different products. 
But whatever the necessary time or temperature, I 
can only get results satisfactory to myself by starting 
at the minimum temperature and finishing at the 
maximum temperature for each particular product, 
having moisture in the dehydrator for a certain length 
of time, which insures all the cells (both inner and 
outer) being uniformly dehydrated, finishing up with 
the highest heat called for, and dry heat at this latter 
period. 

My conclusions have been formed, as I say, through 
years of tests and at times great discouragements, to 
say nothing of mistakes and the following of theories 
which seemed plausible, but whidi e3q)erience and 
better knowledge of the subject made me discard. I 
still have people calling upon me who maintain that 
immediate, dry, direct heat and just the one tempera- 
ture are all-sufficient. The samples of their products 
force me to disagree with them, and m several in- 
stances I have noticed that the previous ideas of using 
dry, direct heat and a one-temperature process have 

33 




DEHYDRATING FOODS 

been abandoned and other dehydration methods have 
been sought after, for it was ascertained, in the pro- 
verbially dear school of experience, that rapid "skin 
drying" means molding later on and imperfect restora- 
tion. 

Further considerations, and essential considerations 
regarding commercial dehydrators handling ton lots 
of produce, are the costs. There are time, fuel, labor 
and other "overheads" to be charged up against the 
products, and I have seen plants where the cost of 
production per finished pound was more than the food 
could be sold for, even though the products were of 
pretty fair quahty. Hence, an apparatus which might 
be used profitably in connection with dyes or chemicals 
would not handle food materials economically. There- 
fore, as there is dehydration and dehydration, so 
there are plants and plants, and it is very important 
when considering a plant to go into the matter of 
costs carefuUy, to say nothing of quality of output, 
and finally to plan and arrange the various steps so that 
there will be no waste action. 

Speaking of heat, radiate heat does give better 
results than direct heat from a furnace. The drying 
is more uniform and evaporation is more gentle and 
regular, all of which has an important bearing upon 
the finished goods. 

Heat, circulation and elimination of moisture are 
such essential factors in dehydration that these three 
coactive points should be carefully considered before 
purchasing any plant or adopting any system. And 

34 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

with a dehydration plant for which a large sum is spent 
and which does not embody these three factors in 
proper relation to each other, and which is so expensive 
to operate that the resultant products cost too much, 
loss and disappointment are the certain consequences, 
in which event it is not fair to blame dehydration and 
its principles. 

Some people rely upon huge blowers. These have 
the fault of sweeping air so rapidly over the cut surfaces 
of the materials that "'skin drying" or surface coating 
is often caused thereby; besides which the use of too 
much power or waste heat means an unnecessary" fuel 
expenditure. The best products that I have found 
are obtained by a suction or drawing of the air, giving 
a slight vacuum effect, or by a process in which the 
fanning or blowing seems almost insignificant at first 
sight, but, which nevertheless, circulates the air in the 
dehydrator quite sufficiently, and the radiate heat, 
together with the correct amount of moisture elimina- 
tion, afford results which are eminently satisfactory. 

The Vacuum Process 

While vacuum dehydrators are excellent for many 
substances, no doubt, I have yet to be convinced that 
they are practicable, commercially speaking, as far 
as vegetables are concerned. 

From what I have seen, the equipment is elaborate 
and quite expensive. This system requires a cham- 
ber containing steam-heated shelves, together with 

35 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

a vacuum pump and the necessary heating appa 
ratus. 

As it is impossible to set an exact time for the de- 
hydration of any one material, it is necessary, with this 
system, to "turn off the vacuum" and open the cham- 
ber in order to inspect the material, and then to reseal 
and re-establish the vacuum in case the product is 
not ready for removal. Moreover, all this may have 
to be done more than once, and in case too high a 
vacuum is used the materials are apt to be shattered 
severely. In fact, I have seen foods treated by this 
process which were puffed up and blistered in many 
places, and in other materials the cellular structure 
was obviously broken down, although this may have 
been the fault of the operator and not of the system. 

It is claimed for the vacuum process that fish and 
meats dehydrated thereby do not undergo protein 
coagulation, but for that matter I have seen fish and 
meats of various kinds dehydrated perfectly by other 
processes, and the delicate flavors and aromas of fruits 
and vegetables retained just as well. 

Despite the foregoing, however, I do believe that a 
good, commercial vacuum dryer will be procurable. In 
fact, I am to test one that is nearly finished and very 
promising. 

Regarding Appearance of Products 

While it is most important to furnish or produce 
dehydrated foods that will restore and cook perfectly 

S6 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

• 

as to flavors, colors and other qualities, we must not 
overlook the necessity of attractive appearance when 
dehydration has been accomplished, as this means 
salability and demand. I am very sure that people 
would hesitate before buying, and even refuse to buy, 
dehydrated foods that were badly discolored and dis- 
agreeable looking. As a matter of fact, I have seen 
dehydrated stuff which restored and cooked very well 
indeed, but which was so dingy and dark and unat- 
tractive in the packages that most people would not 
take it as a gift, even though the producer knew that 
it would look well and taste good after restoration or 
rehydration. 

Really precooked stuff does not look attractive, but, 
on the other hand, many raw materials treated with a 
little steaming before dehydration do look attractive 
and promising, and, when shown in connection with 
some of the same things restored, it is an easy matter 
to convince prospective purchasers. 

The drying should stop when the product is leathery 
and when np moisture can be squeezed out from the 
ends of pieces after breaking. The ^"brittle" stage 
may be reached during the conditioning later; but 
the products must not be dried "brittle" in the dryer. 

In order to set color and texture, steam blanching is 
advisable. In other words, most raw materials should 
be subjected to a brief period of steaming. This is 
called "blanching," a canner's term, and although 
I do not like the word blanching, as it is commonly 
used, I am following the precedent. 

37 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Blanching may be done in boiling water, but then 
the materials lose some of their nutrients, whereas 
by blanching in steam nothing is lost and the color is 
intensified. Take the case of Brussels sprouts, for 
example. Cut the sprouts in half lengthwise and 
then dehydrate some without blanching and others 
after being steam-blanched. You will find that the 
blanched sprouts look much better upon the comple- 
tion of dehydration; also they restore more quickly, 
and even look better when cooked. 

The blanching should be quickly done. The truck 
containing the trays can be run into a steam chamber, 
left in for a brief period, and then be immediately 
placed in the dehydrator, which should be ready 
heated to the starting temperature. As soon as fruits 
and vegetables are peeled and cut they become subject 
to chemical changes, decomposition and the action of 
bacteria, yeasts and molds, so prompt action is nec- 
essary to arrest and avert undesirable change and 
destructive action. 

If no steaming apparatus is available and blanching 
must be done in boiling water, the material should be 
placed in a wire basket and active boiling be assured 
for the time necessary for each material. 

While approximate times and tables are given later 
on in this book, it must be understood that the times 
can only be approximate, for the produce varies ac- 
cordmg to the season, soil in which grown, and its 
staleness or freshness, and, of course, the way in which 
it is cut, — slices, cubes, strips and their relative 

88 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

thickness. Hence judgment must be exercised, but 
a little experience will soon enable one to determine 
the exact length of time for blanching, and, as ex- 
plained later on, for the dehydration process itself. 

Another question comes up, and that is the matter 
of cold-dipping. This means quickly dipping the 
blanched materials into cold water. Immediately 
after blanching, the materials are plunged into cold 
water, then quickly taken out, drained for a few mo- 
ments and placed in the dehydrator. It is said to set 
the color, the shock destroys certain bacteria, and that 
some products restore quicker after undergoing the 
cold-dip. So, while the cold-dip may be used, if de- 
sired, I have discarded it as of no particular advantage. 

After the products are removed from the dehydrator 
there is a process very essential, which has been called 
"conditioning" or "curing." 

This means that the product is to be exposed in trays 
or bins for a time, and it should be covered carefully 
with cheesecloth, for the greatest care must be exer- 
cised to prevent insects getting at the material that 
is "conditioning;" otherwise infestation is probable, 
with disastrous consequences. There are moths which 
particidarly favor dehydrated fruits and vegetables, 
and consider them ideal media in which to lay their 
eggs. These eggs would hatch later, and the grub 
worms, or larvse, would rapidly cause havoc in the 
product. Hence it is most important that the strictest 
precautions be observed. I have found that 72 hours 
is sufficient time for conditioning, and in this time the 

39 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

products dry out still further, so that is another reason 
why they should not stay in the dehydrator until 
brittle, but rather come out leathery, although suffi- 
ciently dry. 

The dehydrator and conditioning rooms must be 
kept inunaculately clean; windows and doors should 
be screened, and I would advocate a thorough steriliza- 
tion of the entire plant at brief intervab. Moreover, 
while '* conditioning," the products should be kept in 
a relatively cool, dark place and eternal vigilance be 
exercised to exclude the troublesome moth pests. 
Moreover, darkness prevents the products bleaching 
out, and for this reason it is advisable to have screens 
or shutters whereby the light can be excluded when 
desired. 

During "conditioning" the product should be turned 
over twice a day so as to let the air get at it uniformly, 
and while this "conditioning" may seem like a trivial 
matter, again I say that it is most necessary. 

Auxiliaries such as peelers and cutters may be em- 
ployed to good advantage, depending largely upon 
quantity handled and labor costs, and, as with every- 
thing else, there are poor, good and best machines for 
this purpose.

CHAPTER V 

PACKING AND PRESERVATION 

The matter of sulphuring is a much-disputed point. 
Some people advocate it, wliile others are violently 
opposed to it. Those who favor it claim that it is not 
injurious to health, while their opponents assert that 
it is. 

Be that as it may, how long does sulphuring protect 
fruits and vegetables against insect attack? We have 
all seen sun-dried apricots, etc., horribly infested, 
although these products have admittedly been sul- 
phured. 

At present, therefore, sulphurization would seem to 
be a matter of personal predilection. 

Generally speaking, apples, apricots, pears and 
peaches are sulphured before drying in order to pre- 
vent discoloration, and in many cases, after sun drying, 
to destroy the grub worms with which they have be- 
come infested during the process. 

As 1 have stated previously, I am not advocating 
the use of sulphur, and when we read that during the 
war the government specifications called for non- 
sulphured potatoes, it is readily seen that sulphuring 
is not looked upon with favor generally. There are 
those, however, who wish to employ sulphur, especially 
with potatoes, so for that reason I will say that one 
producer whom 1 know very well says that he uses 

41 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

^0 pounds of sulphur to 100,000 pounds of sliced or 
cubed potatoes, these being all ready for the dehydrator. 
Moreover, he employs just a suggestion of sulphur 
fume in the dehydrator during the entire process, al- 
though the main sulphuring is done before the potato 
goes into the dehydrating chamber, and he states that 
sulphurization eflEectually prevents enzymic action, 
so that while the blanched product will ferment in 
humid cUmates the sulphured potato will not. 

In using sulphur judgment must be exercised and 
allowances made for whether the product is new or 
old, and how thickly the trays are loaded. 

In dealing with sulphured potatoes ultima! ely, it is 
very important that they should be cooked in steam 
instead of boiling water, as when cooked in boiUng 
water they become slimy and have a disagreeable 
eflEect, which can be removed, however, by putting the 
pieces in a sieve or colander, after cooking, and letting 
hot water run through them. 

Sulphuring is an easy matter for those who wish 
to employ the process, but it should be done out of 
doors, as the fumes are very disagreeable. 

For small quantities of material a wooden box large 
enough to enclose the trays, one over the other, may be 
used, the lowest tray being a few inches above the 
ground. Sulphur can be placed in a metal container 
and ignited, but the product should not be left over the 
fumes longer than is necessary. 

For large quantities a wooden receptacle can be 
constructed which will hold anywhere from 8 to 15 

42 



PACKING AND PRESERVATION 

trays, — in fact, the average truck load of trays, — 
and the sulphur employed as just stated, some pro- 
ducers fuming for 10 minutes, while others advocate 
as much as 25 or 30 minutes. 

Dipping fruits to prevent discoloration has been 
tried extensively, chlorate of potash, permanganate 
of potash, sulphate of magnesia, chloride of lime, 
peroxide of hydrogen, etc., being used in different 
strengths, but none of these has proved satisfactory. 

Some people engaged in commercial dehydration sub- 
ject the products just before packing, or in the open 
packages, to a temperature of 180° to 185° F. for a 
period of from 3 to 5 minutes, in order to steriUze 
them. The material is put into cold chambers and the 
temperature is then quickly raised to the required 
degree. If in an oven the door should be left slightly 
open. Seal packages immediately after sterilizing. 

Regarding packages there are many forms of commer- 
cial cartons used, vegetables like potatoes and beans, 
which do not stain, being put up in ordinary paper car- 
tons, while berries and the like are put into cartons 
which are paraffined. There is also a very good pack- 
age, grease-proof, which is silica lined and waxed on 
the outer surfaces, and the reports I receive as to it 
are very favorable. There are also tin cans sealed 
under a vacuum process after being packed, while 
other cans have covers which can be pried open and 
snapped shut again. For moist, tropical climates cans 
may be necessary and probably are, but, generally 
speaking, dehydrated products keep better if the 

43 



DEHYDRATING FOODS '

packages allow of some circulation of air, although f 

they must be insect proof. 

For home use, paper bags securely tied and pref- 
erably paraffined, ordinary cardboard boxes, crocks, i 
wooden pails, etc., may be utilized, but the packages j 
must be kept in a dry place and preferably at a mod- 
erate temperature.

CHAPTER VI 

DEHYDRATING FOODS IN THE HOME 

Followed by General Hints and Data 

A good little home dehydrator is a useful and val- 
uable article. It will prevent internment in the kitchen 
and standing over a hot stove, for you can put your 
fruits and vegetables into it» use your little dehydra- 
tor on your range or stove, and practically no more 
attention is necessary untU the time is up for the 
product to have finished drying. In this way you can 
save both small and large amounts of summer food 
materials, obtained when they are cheap and plenti- 
ful, for use next winter in so perfect a degree that they 
will be as tasty and delicious as when fresh picked. 

Furthermore, if you still want to have home-canned 
fruits and vegetables of your own, and good jams, 
jeUies and preserves, you can make these up in winter, 
and at any time most convenient to yourself, from the 
products which you have dehydrated during the 
sununer, for from the products which you have de- 
hydrated during the summer you can do your canning 
and conserving just as perfectly as if you did it at 
the time you got the fresh product. 

In order to satisfy myself that dehydrated products 
would do anything that fresh produce would do, I 
tested them out in every way, including canning, and 
in consequence I have a complete stock of canned 

45 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

fruits and vegetables, perfect jellies, jams, marmalades 
and conserves of every kind, all from dehydrated 
materials. 

Y^liere a coal range is being used constantly, the home 
dehydrator very soon pays for itself by affording the 
means of saving small lots of fruits and vegetables which 
might be lost or thrown away but for dehydration. 

It does not pay to put up just a small lot of stuff 
in glass jars, for there is so much work involved, — the 
sterilizing of jars, rubbers and tops, then the filling 
and emptying of the hot-water bath and other inci- 
dentals, whereas the fruits or vegetables on hand may 
be cut as desired, placed on the trays in the dehydrator 
and the drying down on the top of the range, where- 
upon no close attention is necessary. When the time 
is up the produce may be examined, and if dehydra- 
tion is completed the material may be set in a shallow 
pan or other cheesecloth-covered receptacle and put in a 
cool, dark place to condition for three days or so, stirring 
the stuff a couple of times daily so as to allow uniform 
curing. A cheesecloth covering is very advisable. 

If comparatively large amounts are to be dehydrated 
at home, a regular day's work can be devoted to this 
purpose, and as the dryer may be filled and emptied 
two or three times a day, it will be realized that a large 
amount of good farm or garden produce may be set 
aside to be used during the foUowing winter, where- 
upon it will be foimd to be as delicious as the fresh- 
picked, — that is, if it has been properly dehydrated, 
— a simple matter, after all. 

46 



N 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

There are as many theories about home dehydration 
as there are about home dryers. I do not think it is 
worth while to go into the details of these various 
theories, so I will tell what means and methods I 
have personally found to be the best, after several 
years of doing dehydration in my kitchen. 

The very first, and a most important, consideration 
is the dryer itself. You cannot get satisfactory results 
from a dryer which is not built on correct principles, 
and which works against Nature's laws, as many of 
the little dryers do. 

As I said earlier in this volume, drying and dehy- 
dration are not the same thing. I think it will be well 
to give my reasons again for making that statement. 

Everything is composed of tiny cells, each cell 
containing flavoring essentials, coloring matter and 
nutritive properties, and of course a relatively large 
amoimt of fluid. By dehydration you quickly draw 
the water or fluid through the cell walls or membranes 
without rupturing the cell walls. Thus you leave 
everything in the cells except the water, and this can 
be restored by allowing the products to soak in water 
for a certain length of time, when they will take back 
all or nearly all of the water that was originally ex- 
tracted. Whereas mere drying is a long, slow process, 
and after a time the cell walls crack and allow the 
volatiles to escape and chemical changes to take place, 
so that you lose flavor, coloring and other properties. 

To dehydrate, whether it be on a large commercial 
scale in ton lots, or in small quantities in the home, 

47 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

you must have a certain degree or degrees of heat, 
neither too little nor too much, for if the temperature 
is too low you do not extract your moisture rapidly 
enough, and if the temperature is too high you break 
the cells and even cook the produce, and if it is once 
cooked it will never restore to a nice fresh flavor, 
appearance and condition. 

So you must have the requisite heat; also a good 
circulation of air and an efficient means of taking 
away the moisture that is liberated from the cells, 
and this must be done quite rapidly and continuously. 

Hence while drying can be done in an oven, dehydra- 
tion is impossible thereby, for the necessary circula- 
tion and prompt removal of moisture cannot be ob- 
tained. Consequently the stuif bakes or else cooks in 
its own steam. 

I have tested something like twenty home dryers, 
but I have found that most of them lack the necessary 
qualifications whereby good products can be assured. 
As I have stated already, in order to dehydrate prop- 
erly there must be a certain amount of heat, a circula- 
tion of air and a continuous means of removing the 
moisture that is Uberated by evaporation. The ma- 
jority of the home dryers are painfully lacking in these 
respects. Many of them do not give imiform dehydra- 
tion, even on one tray, and taking the trays through- 
out, you will find that the product on some of the 
trays is hardly warmed through, while the material on 
the other trays is overdried or even scorched. 

When you have a dryer with trays set above each 

48

other and with an open bottom, which is placed on a 
coal range or over a gas or oil burner, the materials 
on the lowest trays become warmed first, and as the 
moistmre is Eberated it rises and upon coming into 
contact with the cooler materials on the upper trays 
the moisture condenses and precipitates. Thus you are 
working against yourself. Of course, this can be ob- 
viated to a certain extent by changing the trays from 
time to time, but this requires work and attention 
which are not always convenient. However, there is 
a home dryer which does away with the need of this 
work and fussing. It is a simple and inexpensive little 
dehydrator which you place over the source of heat, 
and beyond looking at the thermometer inside once or 
twice during the process of drying, no more attention 
is necessary. Furthermore, this little dryer is equipped 
with a deflector or radiator which distributes the heat 
and so helps to prevent scorching or cooking when 
placed over the direct flame of a gas or oil burner. 

Speaking of this particular little home dehydrator, 
one of the greatest food authorities in the United States 
called at my testing kitchen and saw the dehydrator 
operating, and also examined the splendid products 
emanating therefrom. He wrote an article for one of 
the leading New York newspapers, in which he said 
that *'this little cheap device makes use of a scientific 
principle which is foolproof in its operation and which 
turns out the finest foods I have ever seen.'' 

It is always well to have a thermometer, for then 
you can be assured that you are employing the proper 

49 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

degree of heat as per the temperatures given with the 
approximate tJme-tables in this book. Guessing at the 
temperature is a mistake, for then you can neither be 
sure of quality of your product nor the time to leave 
it in the dehydrator. It is well to be as exact as possi- 
ble, so obtain a thermometer with a flat back, and 
after putting the dehydrator on the range or stove 
with the heat on, place the thermometer on one of 
the lower trays, and see that it registers the proper 
degree of heat before you put your produce into the 
dehydrator. 

I found it well to have a little moisture in the bottom 
of the dehydrator so that the outer surfaces of the cut 
materials will not become glazed over, as they will if 
dry heat is immediately applied. That "skin drying" 
prevents the moisture from the interior of the pieces 
getting out as it should. Consequently, when the 
product feels quite dry and you might think it was 
dehydrated throughout, there is still enough interior 
moisture to cause a fermentation and eventually form 
a mold on the surfaces by slowly coming through. 
I have seen cubed carrots, for example, which were 
quite brittle and which would snap in two, and many 
would judge that these carrots were sufficiently de- 
hydrated, but upon peeling off the outer surfaces the 
cubes would bend instead of snapping, and one could 
promptly see that the middle of the cubes had not 
been thoroughly dried. 

In the case of produce with which it is advisable to 
use moisture, I put a shallow pan of boiling water in 

50 



■Tlar drylnc 2.5 pounds 



DEHYDRATING fflNTS AND DATA 

the bottom of this little home dehydrator, which is 
arranged for this purpose, and I leave the water in for 
half an hour. This gives a certain amount of humidity 
which keeps the cut materials from becoming glazed 
over or seared, and permits of their being warmed 
throughout, — the pores all being opened, so to speak, 
— uniform moisture liberation being assured. At the 
end of the half hour I remove the pan of hot water and 
allow the dehydration process to take its natural course, 
finishing with a fairly high and dry heat. (See approxi- 
mate time and heat tables.) 

Now to mention blanching and cold-dipping in con- 
nection with home work. I have dealt with this in my 
previous chapters upon dehydration, so in case you 
have not read them I would refer you to those chapters, 
as blanching assures the maintenance of pretty colors, 
especially the green shades. 

For blanching at home a special steamer is not 
necessary. You may do the steam blanching in the 
washboiler, as directed later. After taking the tray 
out of the boiler, shake gently for a few moments to 
allow it to drain, then insert the tray into the de- 
hydrator, which has previously been brought up to 
the starting temperature as given in the time-table. 

Manipulating the trays in this way saves a lot of 
handling and possible breakage of the product, and 
you thus obtain a nicer looking and a better dehydrated 
product. 

In the ta*ble, where no blanching time is given, you 
will understand that it is purposely omitted. Regard- 

51 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

ing the produce which I have found it advisable to 
blanch, I mention a special time in each instance. 

Only a day or two ago I made another test while 
dehydrating a quantity of Brussels sprouts. Half of 
them I blanched and set into the dryer without cold- 
dipping. The rest I blanched and cold-dipped, but 
found that the cold-dipped ones took from 20 minutes 
to a half hour longer to dehydrate than did the ones 
that were not cold-dipped. The explanation for this 
is that the second lot, having been cooled off by the 
dipping, required a certain amount of warmth before 
dehydration could proceed, and, possibly, ''the pores 
having to be opened." It is analogous to what we 
experience in a Turkish bath, the pores being opened 
in the hot room and then closed by a plunge into the 
cold-water tank. I do not use cold-dipping. 

After removing your product from the dehydrator, 
be sure to allow it to cure or "condition" three days 
and nights, stirring twice a day or so, so as to aUow 
the air to influence throughout and evenly, and then 
pack away in cardboard boxes, lard pails or other 
receptacles, making sure that they are covered tightly 
enough to keep out insects of all kinds, but not so 
that they will be absolutely air-tight. I have seen de- 
hydrated products that were kept in glass jars, tightly 
sealed with rubbers, just as in home canning, but 
materials kept in that way have a rather musty odor, 
and do not have as good a flavor as foods kept in 
packages which are not air-tight. 

I wish that I could give exact times for dehydrating 

62 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

(as absolutely as I am able to do for home canning), 
but this is impossible, since fruits and vegetables vary 
so much according to their freshness and whether they 
are grown in sandy or clay soils, or in wet or dry seasons. 
Moreover, there is the cutting to consider, as to whether 
they are cut into very thin slices, strips or cubes, or 
into relatively thick pieces. While approximate times 
can be given and are given, the final test is through an 
examination of the materials. When they are leathery 
and no moisture appears upon breaking a piece and 
squeezing the ends, then it is safe to say that dehydra- 
tion is complete. The material should not be brittle 
as it comes from the dehydrator, although it may be- 
come so after a few hours or days, which is all right 
then. 

Furthermore, every piece or strip will not be dried 
to exactly the same stage, but during '^ conditioning" 
and turning over they average up, some which are a 
little too dehydrated perhaps absorbing moisture from 
those which have not been quite sufficiently dehy- 
drated, the latter giving out their little surplus of 
moisture, so that it may be said to average into proper 
state. For this and other reasons the *' conditioning" 
is a very important matter and should never be neg- 
lected. I say this after having tested products in 
two ways, — one "conditioned" as aforesaid, and the 
other being packed into closed receptacles directly 
after taking the stuff out of the dehydrator. To 
further assure myself on this point I have even put 
the dehydrated products directly from the dehydrator 

5S 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

into tin cans, sealing them hermetically forthwith, 
also into vacuum jars; but after restoring and cooking, 
my preference is decidedly in favor of the air "condi- 
tioned" product. 

As many raw materials reduce, approximately, from a 
pound to an ounce or so through peeling, trimming and 
dehydrating, it will be readily seen what a saving of 
space is assured by this process, and if the packages 
are stored in a dark, dry place, at a moderate tem- 
perature, and the contents have been properly de- 
hydrated, there is little danger of spoilage, although 
it is just as well to use up everything the following 
winter. Yet I have some stocks of dehydrated fruits 
and vegetables which have been kept for three years 
or more, and are still in perfect condition. 

A Time-table 

All fruits and vegetables should be cut uniformly 
so that dehydration will be even throughout. They 
should be as fresh as possible, and all wilted and 
decayed portions should be removed. 

The following time-table is the one used in a de- 
hydrating plant where very good products are turned 
out in large quantities from a chamber tray system. 
And here most of the fruits and vegetables are sliced 
or shredded not to exceed one-eighth inch in thickness. 
Even these times depend somewhat on the condition of 
the raw materials, and where heavier slices or shreds 
are used the drying times must be increased accordingly.

DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Fish and Meats 

Fish and meats should be dried at relatively low 
temperatures, otherwise coagulation will result. 

Fatty portions and connective tissues should be 
removed. 

When fresh these materials will dry quicker than 
when previously frozen. Moreover, they will restore 
better. 

They should be restored in cold water. 

Codfish dries well in both the conunercial or home 
dryers, either as steaks or in flakes. Time, about 5 
hours, maximum temperature, 130^ F. Dip fish in 
weak brine solution for 15 minutes, dry without 
rinsing in clear water, and dehydrate. 

The "lean" fish dehydrate well, but the oily kinds, 
such as salmon, cannot be dried as easily or as well 
until one has acquired experience and technique. 

Oysters and clams dry out well, temperature not to 
exceed 130** F. Suitable for chowders or stews. These 
products may be restored in cold milk. 

Good results are obtained by first dipping meat in 
soya bean or other oil of good food value. After 
dehydration the meat should be dipped into warm 
water, 130° F. or thereabouts, in order to rid it of 
the oil. Then return to dryer long enough to get rid 
of the surface moisture.

Sugar beets may be dehydrated, stored and the 
sugar extracted therefrom as and when convenient. 

A good deal of spoiled product comes through the 
carelessness or negligence of employees. It is well, 
therefore, to have thermostatic temperature regula- 
tion and other automatic devices wherever possible. 

Fruits cut into halves should be dried with the cut 
side up, or they will lose valuable juices.

DEHYDRATING FOODS 

If okra, siring beans and peas aie blandied in boiling 
water, a half teaspoon of soda to each gallon of water 
helps to set the color. 

To prerent apple, pear, apricot and peach from dis- 
coloring, drop the pieces, as cut, into cold water con- 
taining lemon juice or salt, — juice of 1 lemon to 3 
quarts of water, or S level tablespoons of salt to 1 
gallon of water. These fruits should not be blanched. 

Bell peiq>ers may be peeled quickly by placing them 
in a pan and heating in the oven until the skins blister, 
whereupon the skins can be readily pulled off. 

Dehydrated tnashed potato may be obtained and 
stocked by boiling potatoes until tender, pressing 
through a ricer on to the trays and drying until crisp. 

Large stalks, as with spinach, should be cut from the 
leaves, dried separately and mixed in later; otherwise 
the leaves will become overdried while the stalks are 
being dehydrated. 

Cut cauliflower "flowerets" into halves or slices. 
Dry separately from the stalks. The stalks make 
good soup stock, but the leaf parts should be removed. 

It is well to spread the trays with cheesecloth when 
treating bananas and the like. Acid fruits should not 
come into contact with the metal tray bottoms, neither 
should tomatoes. 

Onion slices should be cut across, otherwise the mem- 
branous "onion skin" may prevent uniform drying. 

If large berries are to be dried whole, they should be 
pierced lengthwise. A steel knitting needle will serve 
the purpose.

DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

Com on the cob can be dehydrated, but the centre 
of the cob must be bored out. Com dried in this 
way takes too long to dry and to restore to be prac- 
ticable. 

Changes of flavors, or rather addition of flavors, 
may be produced by blowmg in fine powders during 
drying, — mint, for example; many novel and appetiz- 
ing effects are thus made possible. 

When prunes, peaches and other fruits are dipped 
into hot lye solution, the dipping basket should there- 
after be plunged into cold, fresh water so as to wash 
off the lye. 

Fruits must be well ripened but not soft, and well 
sorted and picked over. When paring and slicing are 
done, exposure to air is to be avoided. Rapid, con- 
tinuous work and fresh, sound produce are necessary 
for the best results. 

As regards soup mixtures, the components must be 
dried separately and then mixed as desired, taking 
care to use materials that will all restore and cook 
up equally or nearly so. Whole peas and beans require 
longer soaking than the usual soup vegetables; conse- 
quently, they should be avoided in the original com- 
bination, although they may be added, if desired, after 
longer and separate soaking, and then cooked in.. A 
popular combination is turnips, carrots, onions, cab- 
bage, celery, potatoes and a little parsley, while some 
producers add leek, tomato and green pepper. The 
proportions or percentages vary considerably.

CHAPTER VII 

DIRECTIONS FOR HOME DEHYDRATING 

(VEGETABLES) 

To obtain the very best dehydrated products, see 
that only first quality food is used. Those that are 
young and tender, in other words, "in prime condi- 
tion," will, when soaked, restore to a first-class product. 

The first step is the cleansing. Thoroughly wash 
so that no grit, dirt or sand is left. Then scrape or 
pare to remove skins, with such vegetables as potatoes, 
carrots, etc., or shell to remove pods from peas, lima 
beans, etc. 

The second step is cutting the product into the 
desired shape, such as slicing, cubing, dicing or shred- 
ding. To facilitate the work the drying tray should 
stand under the cutting machine, so that the cut 
product drops directly onto the tray. 

The third step is blanching. A wash boiler is excel- 
lent for this, and will hold the small trays of most 
home dryers. Blanching is as important for home 
dehydrating as it is for home canning, and is done for 
practically the same reasons, namely, to kill certain 
bacteria, to improve the color and to soften the texture 
slightly. 

Blanching is best done in steam, as there is less loss 
of mineral salts than when boiling water is used.

HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

To steam-blanch, place four tall, clean tin cans in 
the boiler, partly fill these with boiling water to hold 
them steady so that the edges of the tray will rest on 
them, then add boiling water to the boiler to a depth 
of 3 inches, and when the water is boiling lower the 
tray so that it rests on the cans, and cover boiler 
tightly; or else use hooks to suspend the trays. 
Water should not be so high that it wiU touch the 
product when in active motion. 

Have a clock in sight when blanching and remove 
the product when the time is reached. 

The fourth step is to place the tray of blanched 
material into the dryer, which should have been heated 
to the required temperature; and let me caution you 
that there must be no *' guesswork" as to this tem- 
perature. A small and inexpensive thermometer is 
necessary. Place this in the dryer, and when the 
correct temperature is reached and the fire so regu- 
lated that the desired temperature is maintained^ 
place the material in the dryer. The regulating of the 
temperature should be started sufficiently early, so 
that there may be no delay after the blanching is 
done. 

The fifth step in home dehydrating is called ''condi- 
tioning." After your product has reached its dried 
stage it is then placed in a rack or pan and set in a 
cool, dry place for three days. During this period the 
dried product is poured into another container once 
or twice each day. This mixes it and allows all parts 
to diy evenly. If there are no screens on doors and 

67 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

windows, be sure to plaoe a piece of clean cheesecloth 
over the product during the '* conditioning" period. 
This prevents any insects from alighting on the food 
and depositing their eggs. If this should happen, then 
look out for worms and trouble. 

The sixth and last step is storing. Home-dried 
foods can be stored in clean boxes, heavy paper bags, 
cartons that can be sealed against insects, parafl&ned 
containers, cans, etc. After packing the foods keep 
them in a cool, dry closet or room. 

When is the Product Dry? 

The best test I find is to break or cut a piece in two, 
and press the cut edge between the fingers. If no 
moisture is noticeable it is sufficiently dry. 

Length of Time for Drying 

This can be given only approximately, as varieties 
of the same product differ in their drying time. 

Again, the age of the product has a great deal to do 
as regards the time required; also how thick the slices 
are cut. The larger the surface that is exposed to the 
heat, naturally the less time is required for evapora- 
tion of the moisture. Likewise some home dryers may 
take longer than others. In my kitchen we have 
noticed a difference of nearly an hour when using the 
same product on different kinds of home diyers, to say 
nothing of quality of finished product. 

I would advise that you keep a careful record of 

68 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

your drying time and use this as a guide for your next 
summer's work. 

In all home drying the temperature must be raised 
very gradually. The degree of heat first mentioned 
should be maintained for about a quarter of the whole 
drying time. With few exceptions, such as herbs 
and leaf products, the drying time is usually of several 
hours' duration. From this you can see that the 
product is kept for some time at the opening or start- 
ing temperature, and then the heat increased 10 
degrees for another period, and so on until the finish- 
ing heat is reached. A very little experimenting with 
one product will give you an idea as to how the heat 
affects it. 

BeeU 

Select beets that are young. Leave all the root and 
8 inches of the top on the beet. Wash carefully and 
place in boiling water, leaving in the water until the 
skin can be slipped off with the hands. This can be 
determined by trying a single beet. Dip beets in cold 
water a minute, drain and remove skins. At same 
time cut away any blemish. Slice vegetable one- 
eighth inch in thickness onto the trays, and place 
each tray in the dryer as soon as prepared. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F. 
Finishing temperature, 145^ F. 
Approximate time, about 8 to 4 hours. 



69 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Beets are sufficiently dry when there can be no 
moisture pressed from them. The length of time 
depends upon the age of the vegetable. A young 
beet without a woody center will dry quicker than an 
old one. 

" Condition " as directed on page 67. 

Beet Greens 

Prepare and diy as directed for Spinach. (See 
page 82.) 

Brussek Sprouts 

Look over vegetable, remove all decayed or wilted 
leaves. Wash in cold water, drain, cut in halves length- 
wise and place on trays. Blanch in steam as directed 
on page 67 for 3 minutes, counting time from moment 
cover is placed on boiler. Remove tray, shake to drain 
and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F. 
Finishing temperature, 145^ F. 
Approximate time, about S to 4 hours. 

The sprouts are sufficiently dried when no moisture 
can be pressed from a cut end. The light leaves in 
center of vegetable may discolor durjing drying, but 
will restore to their natural color.

Blanch in steam 3 minutes, shake to remove water 
and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F. 
Finishing temperature, 135° F. 
Approximate time, about 3} to 4 hours. 

Cabbage is sufficiently dry when no moisture can be 
pressed from stalk portions. Do not increase tempera- 
ture too rapidly or the leaves will not retain their light 
color. 

"" Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Carrota 

Select young, tender carrots. Wash with brush in 
water, scrape and wash again. Cut crosswise into 
one-eighth inch thick slices, or lengtiiwise into slices. 
Pile slices one on another and return them to slicing 
machine for cutting into Julienne strips. Place cut 
carrots on trays and steam-blanch for 3 minutes, re- 
move trays, shake to drain and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 2} to 4 hours. 

If a piece of carrot is broken and no moisture can be 
pressed out, the product is ready to come from dryer. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

The Julienne strips will dry somewhat quicker than 
the slices. Carrots may also be cut into one-fourth

inch cubes. If one vegetable is cut into different 
shapes, each should be dried on separate trays to give 
a uniform product. 

Cauliflower 

Select large, firm, white heads and immerse flower 
side down for 1 hour in a bowl of cold salted water to 
draw out any insects. Then rinse and drain. Separate 
the head into flowerets, cutting off the large stems. 
Every part should be cut into slices one-eighth inch 
thick. Place prepared vegetable on trays, about an 
inch thick, and steam-blanch for 8 minutes. Remove 
from steam, shake a moment and place in dryer. The 
flowerets should be cut lengthwise. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F. 
Finishing temperature, 145^ F. 
Approximate time, about 4 to 6 hours. 

Cauliflower is sufficiently dried when no moisture 
can be pressed from stem of flowers. 
. "Ccmdition" as directed on page 67. 

Instead of separating the cauliflower into its flowers, 
it can be cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. It is 
very interesting to see how the small wisp of dehydrated 
cauliflower rehydrates into its natural colored and sized 
floweret. Indeed, while this vegetable may darken 
considerably during the drying it restores beautifully. 
All leaves should be removed from the stems before 
drying. 



73

Celery 

Select crisp, tender stalks. The white bleached 
celery becomes somewhat dark in drying, whereas the 
green seems to hold its color better. Separate leaves 
from stalks and dry each separately. Directions for 
drying celery leaves will be given under Spinach, on 
page 82. Cut away all discolored parts and cut cross- 
wise into half-inch length pieces. Place on trays an

Corn 

The sweetest dehydrated product will be obtained 
from com in the "^milk" stage; that is, when a kernel 
of com is pressed and the milk flows. Beyond this is 
the "'dough" stage. Husk, place on trays and steam- 
blanch com on the cob long enough to set the milk, 
— about 5 minutes. Drain and cut com from the cob, 
cutting kernels abovit half through for one tray; then, 
using back of the knife, scrape the cobs (on another

Peas 

Select young and strictly fresh-picked peas, and on 
no account use any that have stood until pods are 
wilted. A quick way to shell the peas is to place the 
washed pods in a large saucepan of boiling water and 
leave for 6 minutes. Then drain on to the tray and 
rub the pods briskly over the tray with the hands to 
loosen the peas, and if the mesh is too fine for them to 
drop through, it is a simple matter to shake the peas 
to one end and empty them on to another tray. When 
one tray is loaded to a depth of about 1 inch, steam- 
blanch for 2 minutes, remove tray, shake to drain and 
set in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F.

Potatoes 

White Pqtato 

If a peeling machine is used, there will be less waste 
if potatoes of uniform size are used. While washing the 
vegetable, grade for size. Peel vegetable thinly and 
drop immediately into cold water to keep it white. 
When sufficient have been peeled to fill one tray, the 
potatoes should be sliced one-fourth of an inch thick 
directly onto the tray. Each tray can be loaded 1 inch 
deep. Place the filled tray in the steam container and 
blanch for 3 minutes; remove from steam, dip the tray 
into salted tepid water for a minute, drain by shaking 
and place in the dryer.

Potatoes are dried until they are brittle. 

** Condition" as directed on page 67. 

If a variety is desired, cut some of the sliced potatoes 
into Julienne strips or larger strips (five-eighths of an 
inch thick), like French fried. Again, these vegetables 
can be steamed until cooked in their jackets, then the 
skins peeled off with the fingers and the cooked potatoes 
pressed through a ricer directly onto the trays. If 
you have no ricer put them through your food chopper, 
loading each tray direct from the chopper. Spread 
evenly on the tray and place in the dryer. When 
dried mark the container holding this product "De- 
hydrated Mashed Potato." Directions for using this 
are found on page 153, in last part of recipe for Mashed 
Potatoes. 

Sweet Potato 

Select potatoes of uniform size and wash well with a 
brush. Place in a saucepan with boiling water and 
boil until slightly tender. Drain and peel at once by 
scraping the skins. Sweet potatoes can also be pared 
in a peeling machine. Cut the precooked potato into 
one-eighth inch thick slices directly onto the tray, 
loading it to a depth of 1 inch, then set tray in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 125^ F.

Mashed Sweet Potato," and is your sweet potato flour 
when ground. (See Sweet Potato Pie, on page 193.) 

Pumpkin 

Select a firm, deep-colored pimipkin and cut into 
strips 2 or 3 inches wide. Peel, remove seeds and 
soft, stringy centers, then cut into slices one-eighth

Spinach and Similar Produce 

Look over the vegetable very carefully, removing all 
wilted, decayed leaves and foreign matter, and cutting 
off the roots. Have a dishpan filled with water as 
hot as for dish washing, put in the spinach and wash 
carefully. Lift out spinach, pour off water, rinse pan 
and return spinach. Add more hot water and rinse 
thoroughly, then lift out the vegetable and place on 
trays. While loading the trays cut off the stems and 
dry them on a separate tray. Load tray to a depth 
of several inches, shake to drain the product, then 
place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110^ F. 
Finishing temperature, 180^ F. 
Approximate time, about 1} to 2| hours. 

Spinach is dry when the thick part can be pressed 
without showing moisture, but be careful not to over- 
dry or the product breaks.

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

The stems of spinach are dried separately from the 
leaves, as they usually require longer time, and if they 
were left on, the leaves would probably be dried to a 
powder stage when the stems were ready. After drying 
and "conditioning" the leaves and stems separately 
they may be mixed and then packed. The spinach can 
also be cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. This will 
materially hasten the drying, reducing the time to 
about 1 hour. Celery leaves, Swiss chard and beet 
tops are treated the same as spinach. The heavy 
midrib of the chard is cut out and dried separately from 
the leaf. 

Squash 

I prefer a late squash to the summer variety. Cut 
into strips 2 inches wide, peel and remove soft centers 
and seeds. Cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. 
Place on trays and insert in the dryer without blanching.

Soup Mixtures 

These consist of different kinds of dehydrated vege- 
tables rather finely cut and mixed in varying propor- 
tions according to the flavors desired. A good way to 
do is to use proportions as given in your favorite recipe. 

The vegetables usually combined in these mixtures 
are onions, carrots, turnips, cabbage, celery, parsley, 
potatoes and green pepper. Dry separately. 

For a vegetable soup the vegetables look daintier if 
cut in different shapes. For instance, potatoes and 
turnips can be cubed, carrots and peppers in Julienne 
strips, celery and onions sliced, cabbage shredded and 
parsley powdered. 

Try the following combinations, or arrange your own 
proportions: —

readily see how far the soup mixture goes. It is in a 
most convenient form, and is a decided addition to 
many dishes, especially those of the pot-roast style.

Potato Flours 

A very excellent grade of home-made potato flour is 
prepared as follows: — 

Make sure that both the sweet and white potatoes 
are dehydrated until they are brittle. After "con- 
ditioning'' run these products separately through your 
food chopper, using a medium-coarse knife, then change 
to the finest knife and run it through twice. This 
produces a fine product. Shake through several sifters, 
starting with the coarser mesh and finishing with a 
fine one. Your finely sifted home-made potato flour 
is ready to be made up into various recipes, such as 
combining with com meal or wheat flour into muflSns, 

86 



\^GETABLE FLOURS AND MEALS 

biscuits, griddle cakes, waffles or breads, and even into 
a good pastry if used in proportion of about one-eighth 
potato flour to balance of wheat flour. 

The first sifting of the flour was coarse, and this can 
be kept to use in potato croquettes, soups or lor thick- 
ening sauces, et6. 

The sweet potato flour is all ready to have the 
custard addition, then turned into a pastry lined pie 
tin as a Sweet Potato Pie; see page 193. 

Pumpkin Flour 

This is prepared by drying the pumpkin until it is 
brittle, then ** conditioning,'' putting through the food 
chopper, and sifting as is done with potato flour. When 
so prepared it is no trouble to make pumpkin pie, 
timbales or any other dish in which mashed pumpkin 
is the foundation. In fact, with a supply of dehydrated 
vegetables made into flour or meid in your kitchen 
pantry it is far easier to make many dishes than when 
one must start with the preparation of the raw vegeta- 
ble. 

These two recipes are given simply as a guide to 
direct you so that you can make any one or all of the 
meals in the list. The main point to remember is that 
any dehydrated vegetable that is to be ground up into 
meal must first be dried until it is brittle, or it cannot 
be put through either your food chopper or your hand- 
flour mill and give a satisfactory product.

CHAPTER IX 

HOME DEHYDRATING 
(FRUITS) 

Both the large and small fruits can and should be 
dehydrated. Many of the directions given for vegeta- 
bles are applicable to fruits. 

Only firm, ripe fruits should be used if their original 
shape and color are to be retained in both the dried 
form and when rehydrated. 

Naturally, after the fruit has been cooked, it will be 
changed in shape, and frequently the color will be 
somewhat different, in many cases this being accentu- 
ated after the addition of the sugar. 

To wash the tender small fruits such as berries, 
place them in a shallow flat strainer and hold them 
under the cold-water faucet. Let the water run gently 
on them. This can readily be done if the hand is held 
under the faucet so that the water first strikes the 
hand, and then trickles off on to the fruits. Be careful 
that the berries are not crushed or broken, as that 
means a loss of juice, which naturally would impair 
both color and flavor. 

After washing, the berries are drained and gently 
rolled out of the strainer on to the trays, which should 
be covered with a thickness of clean cheesecloth. This 
is done to prevent the fruit from coming in contact with 
the metal trays, as the acid would cause chemical action. 

While the berries are being placed on the trays any 

88 



HOME DEHYDRATING, FRUITS 

wilted, ^nripe ones can be removed; also leaves or any 
foreign matter. 

Fruit should be promptly placed in the dryer after its 
preparation. Be very careful not to load the trays 
more than two layers deep. Berries are very tender 
fruit, and if loaded deeper they will be crushed out of 
shape. During drying examine the trays, and if fruits 
are lumping and sticking together, sq[)arate carefully 
so that the drying is done evenly. 

The test for drying is by pressing a cut edge, and if no 
moisture exudes the product is sufficiently dried. 

After drying the "conditionmg" period must be 
observed, as with vegetables. When this is finished 
the fruits are stored in similar containers, and should 
preferably be kept in the dark so that they will not be 
faded by the light. 

Apples 

Select firm, sound fruit. Remove cores with a coring 
machine or knife, if apple is to be cut into rings, and 
pare quickly. As soon as peeled cut into slices one- 
fourth inch thick and place on trays about 1 inch 
thick. As soon as a tray is ready it should go immedi- 
ately into the dryer and other trays loaded as quickly 
as the apples are pared. The quicker this is done the 
better the product, as there will be less danger of oxidiz- 
ing or discoloration. 

Starting temperature, 120** F. 
Finishing temperature, 160^ F. 
Approximate time for drying, 5 to 6 hours.

Blackberries 

Select such fruit as you would for table use. Look 
over, rejecting decayed and wilted berries, and wash if 
necessary. This can be done as follows: place berries 
in a shallow wire basket, hold the hand under cold 
water faucet, and let water trickle on fruit through the 
fingers. Drain and place berries in single layers on 
trays lined with one thickness of cheesecloth. As 
quickly as loaded set trays in dryer.

Perfectly sound fruit should be selected and all of one 
color kept together. Look over before pitting, remov- 
ing all decayed and crushed cherries. Both the sweet 
and sour cherries may be dried. There is less loss of 
juice if fruit is dried whole, with pit left in. Where 
cherries are large they may be pitted with a machine, 
the juice saved and sterilized. Some cut the fruit in 
halves. If this method is followed the cut side should 
be placed uppermost on the dryer to prevent further 
loss of juice. As soon as prepared load cheesecloth

in wire basket and immerse in boiling water for a 
minute until skins crack. Remove from water, drain 
and pull skins off with the fingers. Cut fruit in halves, 
remove stones and place on cheesecloth-covered tray 
with cavity side up, loading trays one layer deep, and 
place each tray in dryer as soon as it is ready. Work 
quickly so that the fruit does not darken by being ex- 
posed to the air.

CHAPTER X 

COOKING DIRECTIONS 

In restoring the dehydrated products you will notice 
that some take more time to rehydrate» or bring back, 
just as some require more time to dry than others do. 

Where long soaking is necessary, say 8 or more hours, 
it is convenient to put the product to soak over night. 

It is advisable to soak the food in a deep bowl, with 
the amount of water needed, and turn into the sauce- 
pan when ready for cooking. 

Do not have heat too strong at first, but bring gradu- 
ally to boiling point, and then boil gently (a little more 
than simmering) until tender. 

The water in which vegetables are soaked and cooked 
should be used as part of the liquid in the sauce (see 
recipe for Vegetable Sauce, page 109} when the vegeta- 
ble is served with one. The liquid may also be used in 
soups, thus obtaining flavor and utilizing the mineral 
salts that were dissolved during the boiling of the 
vegetable. 

Vegetables may be soaked in tepid water instead of 
cold, which will hasten their restoration. 

If dehydrated foods are being soaked in hot weather, 
they should be placed in the refrigerator or other cold 
place. Then cook as soon as the product has been re- 
stored. 

95 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Where dehydrated products are to be used for flavor- 
ing, break or cut into small pieces before soaking. 

Fruits as well as vegetables should be cooked in the 
same water in which they are soaked. Bring very 
slowly to boiling point and simmer for 15 minutes, then 
drain, add sugar to liquid, reheat until boiling, add fruit 
and simmer until tender. Best results are always 
obtained by very slow cooking. A fireless cooker serves 
excellently for this purpose. 

Regarding length of time necessary to rehydrate the 
dried product, this depends largely upon how the ma- 
terial was treated before dehydrating, A vegetable 
that was cooked until tender, then dehydrated, will 
restore quicker when soaked, and will cook in a very 
short time. 

Furthermore, after the food is dehydrated, if it is 
ground into a powdered form, litUe time will be re- 
quired for cooking, and no previous soaking is neces- 
sary. 

If your dehydrated products are cut in different ways, 
such as sliced, diced or into strips, select the style of 
product best suited to the recipe. As an example, sliced 
potatoes would be your choice for escalloped potatoes. 

The thoughtful and careful housekeeper who plans 
her meal in advance will find that dehydrated products 
are very easy to serve. The foods that require long 
rehydrating may be soaked over night for a midday 
meal, putting them to soak as late in the evening as is 
convenient. And for the evening dinner, start soaking 
dehydrated products early in the morning. 

96 



COOKING DIRECTIONS 

Suppose, in looking over the recipes included here- 
with, that a housekeeper plans her meals ahead for a 
week. The recipes given, generally speaking, are 
sufficient to serve four people. With this in mind any 
one can cut the proportions in half or double them, 
according to requirements. Or if one wishes to cook 
enough of any one kind of the dehydrated product for 
a second meal, follow the Preliminary Directions, and 
the food is then ready to be served in any way desired. 

There are also a number of recipes for dishes that 
are really a meal in themselves, and, with the addition 
of bread and butter, a salad dessert or fruit, nothing 
more is required. Any one of the following will furnish 
a most delicious meal and one requiring but little 
work:*—

Measurements for Cooking Dehydrated 

Vegetables 

The cup specified in the recipes is the cook's half- 
pint measuring cup, and when dehydrated products 
are used the cup is measured heaping full. 

A tablespoon or teaspoon means all that the spoon 
will hold. 

The above refer to dehydrated vegetables that are 
cut into dices, slices or Julienne strips. 

97 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

When the product is finely cut before dehydrating, 
more can be put into the cup than when the pieces are 
larger. In this event use level measure; also when the 
dehydrated product is powdered, use level measure. 

Unless otherwise stated, all other ingredients are 
measured level.

in water until tender, dissolve cubes in a cup of the boil- 
ing liquid, add to vegetables, bring to boiling point and 
serve. In this way a vegetable soup may be quickly 
prepared, requiring about a half hour. 

Many other soups may be made from the dehydrated 
products by using the recipes given here as a basis for 
other soups. To save time, put the dehydrated product 
through a food chopper, or if the product is dried until 
brittle it can be ground into coarse meal through the 
hand-flour mills. In this event soaking is not neces- 
sary.

CHAPTER XV 

RECIPES FOR USING DEHYDRATED FRUITS 

The measurement for these products is *' heaping*' 
unless given by weight or otherwise stated. 

The fruits are generally soaked in cold water and 
slowly cooked until partly done in the same water. 
Then drain, add sugar to juice» let this boil for several 
minutes, then add the partly cooked fruit and continue 
simmering until tender. The slower dehydrated fruits 
are cooked the richer and better looking will be the 
finished product. 

A very slow oven or a fireless cooker prepares these 
foods the best. All of the larger fruits, such as de- 
hydrated prunes, pears, apricots, peaches and plums, 
are delicious when cooked in the oven in a bean pot or 
casserole. 

Time required to rehydrate fruits depends upon the 
condition and kind of product. While approximate 
time is given in the recipes, however, each cook must 
use her own judgment, and from personal experience 
determine the length of time the special kinds require. 

I have used a dehydrated banana that required no 
soaking, as it was found to be sujBSciently tender when 
prepared as the recipe stated. Again I have seen the 
same fruit when dehydrated by others to be quite hard, 
thus needing some time to rehydrate.

Canning and Preserving Dehydrated Products 

Perhaps our summer has been spent in dehydrating 
our supply of fruits, and winter finds no shelves of 
canned fruits, sparkling jellies, delicious jams, marma- 
lades and all the other good things that we have become 
accustomed to. 

But with our stock of dehydrated fruits we may have 
some of them canned, make conserves, jams, marma- 
lades of others, yes, and jellies and pickles too. . And 
best of all, both our dehydrating and, later on, our 
canning may be done in comfort, for dehydrating is 
carried on at a low temperature; consequently, the 

194 



DEHYDRATED FRUIT RECIPES 

kitchen is not overheated, and in winter, when our 
dehydrated product may become a canned one, we 
are very glad of the extra heat. 

Whoever spent a really comfortable day canning 
and making all the other goodies in hot summer 
weather? Standing over the fire carefully stirring the 
kettle of jam can be comfortably done, however, when 
the snow is on the ground, and not when old Sol is 
doing his utmost to make the work a martyrdom. So 
do not think that because your fruits are in a de- 
hydrated stage you are barred from enjoying them as 
of yore. No, indeed; the dried product gives an 
excellent canned or jellied one, and this is equally true 
of the other forms of preserves, such as jams and 
conserves. 



195 



ADDENDA 
Practical SuggMtions 

Dehydrated products do not restore satisfactorily until 
they have been out of the dehydrator for 24 hours. This 
is probably because the ceUs are tired and need a little rest 
and recuperation, for even "inanimate" matter becomes 
exhausted. 

Be careful not to i7KDEB-DBr, for if free moisture is left in, 
molding is apt to ensue. 

Approximate time-tables have been given, but, as ex- 
plained with them, the times indicated are approximative 
only, or, in plainer term, elastic. Climate, soil, season, al- 
titude, thickness of slices or pieces, water content, age of 
produce are all factors requiring consideration, but with a 
little practice one is soon able to tell by the ''feel*' whether 
dehydration is completed or not, and the test suggested 
previously for free moisture is a safe guide always. Generally 
speaking, products should be leathery and just past the free 
moisture stage. If dried in machine to crisp or brittle stage, 
restoration and quality are doubtful. Most products will 
harden during the conditioning period, which is as it should 
be. 

If a batch of fruits or vegetables should prove insufficiently 
dehydrated after removal from dryer, replace until really 
finished — in low temperature at first, and when material 
is well warmed through raise the temperature to maximum 
for that particular product. 

Dehydrate in dry weather if possible. This applies to 
packing away also. 

196 



ADDENDA 

Dehydrators, large or small, should be thoroughly cleaned 
and sterilized at frequent intervals. 

Produce must be cubed, sliced or stripped uniformly, other- 
wise part of the dehydrator's contents will be ready to come 
out before the rest is done, resulting, perhaps, in both under 
and over drying. 

Moist air is always best in the dehydrator during the first 
quarter or third of the process. 

It is best to cut glutinous material into thin slices or fine 
strips — bell peppers and okra, for example. While such 
things may be dehydrated whole or in large sections, it takes 
very much more time. As a matter of fact, the finer all 
materials are cut, the greater will be the saving of time, fuel 
and attention. Output will be increased also, as the de- 
hydrator can be filled and emptied more frequently. 

With a view to the appearance of finished product, two 
agents are employed by some operators to prevent discolora- 
tion, namely, sulphur and carbonic add gas. The latter was 
in vogue many years ago, having been employed in the old- 
style drum dryers, coke being the source usually. 

Drying times for potatoes vary greatly according to age 
of vegetable. 

When piling trays, allow for circulation of air and libera- 
tion of moisture. Slices should not lie closely on top of each 
other. 

Stems must be removed from leaves of spinach and the 
like before drying, but can be mixed later, after separate 
drying. With cabbage, the thick midrib should be cut from 
leaf and sliced before drying. 

Flavoring herbs, mint, etc., should not be blanched, as 
thereby they lose much of their volatile properties. 

Restoring and cooking are very important considerations. 
Do not drown products by using too much water for restora- 

197 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

tion, but see that there is sufficient for fuU absorption, and 
a little more. Cook the products in the same water in which 
they were restored, as directed in recipe section. 

In dehydrating large quantities there will necessarily be 
a good deal ci broken pieces and scraps. These may be dried 
and mixed for soup stock. 

Before attempting to market various runs, test samples 
for restoration and other qualities. 

Be careful to keep containers insect-proof. Bags and 
packages must have no holes, and must be kept securely 
sealed. It is well to coat with paraffin after sealing. If 
glass jars and crocks are used, they must be tightly covered. 

As volatiles and other essentials are retained through 
dehydration, this process may become an important factor 
in the manufacturing of perfumes. Tests are being made 
now, in my experimental kitchen, with flower petals and 
other materials, to determine whether they can be dehy- 
drated and used later for perfume making, when and as 
convenient. 

Fruit juices are being dehydrated and used in powder 
form for flavorings. 

Vegdakle Ccloringa, — Pure vegetable colorings are made 
by grinding spinach, beets, carrots, etc., to powder after 
dehydration.

A FOREWORD 



THE NEW FOOD ECONOMY 

We have passed through a long and trying experi- 
mental stage of saving foods by dehydration. At last, 
means and methods have not only been perfected, but 
are at the service of every one. 

Dehydration may be accomplished easily and suc- 
cessfully, both in the kitchen and in commercial plants, 
— by the bushel or by the ton, as the case may be. 

For several years patient and unceasing work has 
been done along this line in order to attain the desired 
results, and personally I acknowledge with grateful 
appreciation the kindly co-operation and suggestions 
from Messrs. George Hillard Benjamin, O. H. Benson, 
Woodford Brooks, Joseph S. Caldwell, H. C. Gore, 
S. C. Prescott, Lou D. Sweet, the late Waldron 
Williams, F. G. Wiechmann and other sincere and 
able investigators. 

Moreover, in writing upon the development of de- 
hydration in the United States, it is only just to pay a 
sincere tribute to the altruistic and laudable efforts 
of Mrs. Oliver Harriman in behalf of this beneficent 
work.

DEHYDRATING FOODS 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 



CHAPTER I 

REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

The dehydration of foods is one of the most im- 
portant considerations in the world. It is the means of 
preserving foods quickly, cheaply and perfectly, and it 
will save thousands of tons of garden, orchard and farm 
produce which have gone to waste hitherto. 

By dehydration, all kinds of foods — fish, meats, 
fruits and vegetables, and even milk and eggs — may 
be reduced to a fraction of their original weight and 
bulk. Moreover, when properly dehydrated, the foods 
maintain not only their nutritive properties, but their 
flavorings and colorings as well, being far superior to 
canned products in this regard. 

Those of us who have worked practically at dehydra- 
tion and with dehydrated products realize that this 
art or science is bound to effect a revolution in our 
means and methods of food preservation, and interest 
in dehydration and appreciation of its possibilities are 
spreading rapidly throughout the world. 

During my lectures upon foods and cookery during 
the past two years most of the questions coming from 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

the audiences were about dehydration, or "drying'* 
as the majority consider it, while I have people calling 
at my testing kitchen almost daily regarding systems 
and methods, among them being visitors from Cuba, 
South American countries, Italy, France, Great Britain 
and Canada, in addition to those from all over the 
United States. 

There is a very essential difference between drying 
and dehydration, and this fact must be recognized. 
As we know, all food materials are composed of myriads 
of tiny cells, these cells holding flavorings, colorings 
and nutrients, together with a large percentage of 
fluid — practically water. The problem has been how 
to extract the water from the cells without causing 
chemical changes and loss of essential principles. 

Broadly speaking, dehydration is a method of ex- 
tracting the water quickly without rupturing the mem- 
branes or cell walls. Thus only the water is taken away, 
and the volatiles, the flavoring essences, the colorings 
and the nutritive properties are left in the cells. It is 
just the principle of osmosis (a sweating, as it may be 
termed), and when the dehydrated or dehumidified 
products are soaked in water for a time their cells 
absorb moisture, and furnish, to all intents and pur- 
poses, fresh food materials which may be cooked and 
dealt with just as could be the original raw foods. 

Drying, on the other hand, is a slow process, — so 
slow that the cell walls crack and open, allowing the 
volatiles and aromatics to escape and the coloring prin- 
ciples to change; hence the flavor and appearance of 

2 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

dried products are not and cannot be equal to those of 
dehydrated products. 

As tangible evidence of this we will consider grass 
and hay. Hay is dried grass, and even though you 
soak hay in water you cannot "restore" it, whereas 
dehydrated grass "comes back" fresh, green and succu- 
lent. 

Let us take dried apples as another example. Dried 
apple pie is always dried apple pie, as every one can 
tell upon tasting it, whereas pie made from dehydrated 
apples yields a dish that is really fresh apple pie, and 
it cannot be distinguished from pie made with the 
fresh-cut fruit. 

To emphasize still further the conspicuous merits 
of dehydrated fruits and vegetables, I have often 
served dehydrated products and strictly fresh ones at 
the same meal, and no one could tell which was which. 
Recently a food commissioner from a neighboring coun- 
try wrote to ask me what I thought of dehydration, and 
what plant or system of dehydration could I recom- 
mend. I replied that the subject was too important to 
deal with satisfactorily by correspondence, but that 
if he would call at my testing kitchen in New York he 
could see my exhibit of dehydrated products, — fish, 
oysters, meats and almost every fruit and vegetable 
grown in the United States, and that we could then 
discuss the technical details of dehydration to good 
advantage. 

This man came and brought another food official 
with him, whereupon I prepared a luncheon at which 

3 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

were served fresh-picked carrots, spinach, turnips and 
cabbage, the latter chopped finely and served raw with 
a dressing, as cabbage salad. At the meal I served the 
same things dehydrated, the carrots and spinach having 
been dehydrated a couple of years previously. My 
guests confessed that they could not tell which were the 
fresh vegetables and which were the dehydrated ones. 
Finally, one of them said, "Oh, Mrs. Andrea can 
make anything taste good," but while I appreciated 
the compliment, I protested very promptly, saying 
that he was not being fair to dehydrated products, 
because all can cook and serve dehydrated products 
that will be just as delicious as fresh-picked stuff, 
provided that they will follow simple rules and direc- 
tions. And, as it happened, in this particular instance 
my maid had prepared everything under my directions, 
so the whole thing was really a sincere tribute to 
dehydration. 

As drying is a more convenient term to use, we will 
consider it for our purpose herein as dehydration, desic- 
cation or dehumidifying; consequently, when the word 
"drying" is used it is to be understood in its restricted 
sense. 

I have tested samples of dehydrated fruits and 
vegetables from Denmark, Germany, Russia and other 
European countries, but find that over there they 
precook everything before dehydrating it. This means 
a great loss in flavor and appearance, and when the 
precooking has involved a boiling process a large per- 
centage of the valuable nutrients and solubles escape

REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

into the water, with consequent and material loss of 
desirable properties. 

We have improved vastly over the European meth- 
ods, for we dehydrate most of our produce raw, with 
few exceptions, such as potato, beets and corn, the 
latter being steamed only long enough to set the milk. 

Just a word of caution will be a propos here. There 
is dehydration and what many people mistake for 
dehydration, the latter being improperly and imper- 
fectly done. The produce must be dried "below the 
enzyme stage" and throughout; uniformly from centre 
to surface. That is to say, there must not be enough 
moisture left to permit of fermentation or mold, but 
at the same time there must be a sufficient percentage 
of moisture left in the products so that they will 
"restore" as they should. 

Already, many people have met with disastrous losses 
through trying to put dehydrated products on the 
market in packages, without realizing the importance 
of the foregoing. The products molded and spoiled, 
and in many cases developed grub worms and insects, 
all of which meant loss and disappointment to the 
packers, and distrust of dehydrated products on the 
part of the public. 

This need not be a source of discouragement, however, 
for proper dehydration and treatment of the products 
overcome these troubles, and we must remember that 
when canned foods were first put on the market, con- 
stant spoilage and loss occurred until the packers 
learned the means and methods now employed by them. 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Of course, reasonable care must be exercised in regard 
to keeping foods that have been dehydrated, for nothing 
in Nature will stand abuse or mistreatment. As an 
instance of this I was once called into consultation with 
some people who were putting out dehydrated milk 
(milk powders) on a large scale. They were having 
constant trouble with their customers, with bakers 
especially, who claimed that while they realized what 
milk powders could do when used in their bread, cake 
and other mixtures, the powders became rancid and 
unusable, so that they would not experiment with them 
any farther. Upon visiting these dissatisfied bakers 
I found that after having purchased the powdered 
milk in barrel lots they were keeping these barrels 
open, and close to radiators, ovens and other sources 
of heat, so no wonder rancidity and spoilage ensued. 

When this little matter of cause and effect was 
pointed out, and their future supplies were kept in 
dry, cool and suitable places, no further complaints 
were received, and the business has grown to enormous 
proportions. 

In concluding this chapter I would say that while 
those who have worked with dehydration, and have 
used properly dehydrated products, become enthusiastic 
converts to this form of food preservation, as the sub- 
ject is so new and as yet comparatively little known, 
I will now quote statements regarding dehydration 
from various authorities in support of my own views 
and claims.

General Realization coming 

As a people we have not yet realized that for many decades 
we have been paying millions of dollars annually for water 
that we did not want, — water that we might just as easily 
have had well-nigh for nothing, by working the pump or 
turning on the faucet. 

Take, for instance, a case of canned tomatoes costing about 
$4 and containing two dozen tins, each weighing 2 pounds. 
The canner's outlay for the tomatoes themselves did not ex- 
ceed 15 cents. In other words, the ultimate consumer is 
spending $3.85 for 15 cents worth of tomatoes, and probably 
full 90 per cent of each 2-pound can is tin and water — 
mostly water. 

The economic wastage becomes still more conspicuous 
when you realize that a tax in the way of freight charges is 
being levied for the transportation of every pound of that 
water, and of the cans and boxes that make it possible to 
ship the tomatoes in that form. The canned tomato is no 
whit more palatable or nourishing than its dried rival. The 
24-can case tips the scales at 60 pounds, while the same 
quantity of the vegetable when dried weighs only 2| pounds, 
and can be packed in pasteboard containers. 

Probably the sacrifices due to the water content of the 
canned product can be made even plainer. It is practicable 
to ship dried in 1 car what it would take 30 cars to carry of 
the canned goods. In a carload of canned tomatoes there are 
10,000 pounds of tin and 14,000 pounds of lumber, a total of 
24,000 pounds, and for 30 cars freight would have to be paid 
on 360 tons of materials that could in no wise help the hungry 
consumer. An expert has further elaborated upon the wastage 
and lost motion involved. He says: " There is the movement 
of the tin-making material from the mines to the tin-plate 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

factory, and the movement of the tin plate from the tin- 
plate factory to the tin-can plant; and the movement of the 
logs to the sawmill and of the lumber thence to the box 
shook works, and the shooks from there to the cannery. The 
aggregate of this service gives us 105 carloads as against 1 
carload of dried vegetables." The cardboard containers 
are made from waste material, and the cartons, folded flat, 
capable of holding a carload of desiccated vegetables, can be 
carried in a very small space. 

Last year we raised 400,106,000 bushels of potatoes, and 
from government sources we learn that only about 32 per 
cent of our total potato crop ever moves out of the territory 
in which the tubers are grown. A staggering percentage of 
the potatoes are scrapped or fed to cattle simply because they 
are not first class, measured by market standards, or it is 
impossible to ship them away to other districts for human 
consumption. 

The potato is 78 per cent water in its edible portion. In 
Germany they dried in the course of twelve months, according 
to the latest available reports, 800,000,000 bushels, sub- 
stantially twice as many potatoes as we raise in the whole 
United States annually. Every pound of those desiccated 
potatoes was 100 per cent foodstuff, and could be kept many 
months without deterioration. This was apart from the 
potatoes which were utilized in the ordinary fresh condition. 

Again, for fresh vegetables shipped long distances we pay 
extravagantly. This is to cover spoiling in transit or pres- 
ervation while on the road, besides taking care of the trans- 
portation charges. A western grower urged Congress about 
a year ago to take steps to promote dehydration in this 
country. According to him: "Just before I left California 
I saw a shipment of 50 pounds of green sprouts about to be 
despatched to some point east where the express rate is 

8 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

12 cents a pound. In order to ship that 50 pounds of green 
sprouts they had to include a 100-pound cake of ice, and 
to pay on that ice at the same rate, making a total express 
outlay of $18. The whole 50 pounds could have been dried 
and mailed by parcel post, the package weighing 3 pounds 
and calling for 35 cents in stamps." — The Sun, New York. 

The United States Department of Agriculture informs us 
that fully 50 per cent of all the vegetables and fruits grown in 
America never reach the consumer. They rot on the ground. 

This tremendous loss is due to difficulties of transportation 
combined with the fact that only the fanciest quality of 
fruits and vegetables will pass final market inspection for 
profitable shipping and trading. 

The American dehydrating processes now encouraged 
would conserve every particle of these waste products, con- 
tributing tremendously thereby to the wealth of the farm, 
and adding thousands of tons of perfect foods to the nation's 
dietary. 

The value of vegetables and fruits because of their flavor, 
fiber and indispensable alkaline salts is recognized by scien- 
tists all over the world. Their use is essential to the physical 
welfare of soldiers, sailors and civilians. 

In the dehydrated products the food elements, the al- 
bumens, starches, sugars, fats, oil and salts suffer no impair- 
ment of their food value. The food cells and cell membranes 
are not injured, but retain their normal function. 

The dehydrated product after immersion in water resumes 
its original freshness and appearance, retains its original 
coloring principles, its essential oils and other volatile con- 
stituents. 

The drying process So imprisons the delicate bouquet and 
the fine flavor of the raspberry that the manufacturers of 

9 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

pure fruit extracts actually prefer the dehydrated berry to 
the fresh berry. The reason for this is very simple. The 
extract manufacturer has to wait from two to five days after 
the berry is picked before he can put his hands upon it. On 
the other hand, when picked fresh and put into the dehydrat- 
ing machine right on the farm or in a near-by plant the full 
flavor and bouquet of the berry is sealed up at once and 
remains sealed up until it is again released by its bath in 
cold water before cooking. 

What is true with regard to the raspberry is also true with 
regard to apples, apricots, figs, peaches, pears, plums, cherries, 
quinces, strawberries, blackberries, huckleberries, currants, 
grapes, rhubarb, tomatoes, eggplant, squash, pumpkin, corn, 
peas, mushrooms, string beans, horseradish, herbs, etc. — 
The Globe, New York. 

Dehydration is the science of removing water from vege- 
tables and fruits. There are two methods, — the German, 
which cooks the vegetable with live steam before drying, to 
break down the starch cells, and the American, which dries 
by passing hot air over the product. There is no loss of taste, 
color or food value with the American process. Virtually 
all fruits and vegetables can be dehydrated and they will 
keep indefinitely. — General Facts about Dehydration,

In order that the layman may realize something of- what 
dehydration involves, it might be well to show how large a 
part water plays in some staple fruits and vegetables. Let 
us tabulate these for easier reference.

The housewife pays for all of this water at exactly the 
same rate per pound as she does for the food content. Fur- 
thermore, the nutritive value of dried fruits and vegetables 
increases directly as the percentage of water diminishes. 
Plainly we are dietary spendthrifts when we insist upon 
fresh produce, and it is evident that we can effect a very 
handsome saving if we will content ourselves in the cold 
seasons with dehydrated products. 

By the latest American process the products to be dried 
are commonly treated within a very few hours after they 
have been gathered; in fact, they reach the so-called dry- 
ventors far fresher than most of us know such commodities. 
We have to wait at times days before they come to the table, 
and nearly every hour after picking there is measurable 
deterioration and loss of flavor. 

The ultimate products when soaked in water, as they 
should be for a short time before cooking, regain their original 
form, and taste as crisp and fresh and full-flavored as though 



11 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

newly gathered. Of course, the dried foodstuffs occupy but 
a small part of the space taken up by the original fresh 
produce. 

For example, a barrel of dried mixed vegetables that will 
make jBrst-class soup weighs but 100 pounds and will provide 
a steaming plate for 7,000 persons. Before drying, these 
vegetables fill something like 30 barrels. This saving in 
weight and bulk is a matter of especial importance now be- 
cause of car shortage and railway congestion. — The 
Herald, New York. 

And the weight of expert opinion is emphatically that we 
are about to decide in favor of a revolution; that we are 
about to institute a change in our mechanism of food supply 
more fundamental in its nature, and more far-reaching in its 
results, than anything since the invention of the tin can 
itself. We are going to discard the whole elaborate system 
of preserving our food in condition to eat; instead of wetting 
it down and cooking it before preservation, we are going to 
dry it out thoroughly, and, in all but a few cases, preserve it 
raw. Dehydration is the word. — American Cookery, Bos- 
ton, Mass. 

And last, but not least, there are various types of dryers 
for home use, so that the housekeeper can see and learn how 
to dry or dehydrate her fruits and vegetables so that they 
can be "restored" by simply soaking in water at any time 
during the winter. The original orchard and garden fresh 
flavors and colors will be in them to perfection, for proper 
drying means that merely the water content has been removed 
without rupturing the cell walls or changing the flavors, 
colors and nutritive properties. It is a pleasant considera- 
tion that no winter day can prove so cold and dreary but 
that you can have the cheer and good things of summer time

on the home table by means of dehydrated products. — The 
Tribune, New York. 

The one great lesson taught by the special instruction train 
to promote food preservation, which was visited by hundreds 
of persons last evening at the Erie station, is that of dehy- 
drating foods. Everything from peas to prunes, including to- 
matoes, asparagus, spinach, carrots, beans, pineapple, squash, 
can be dehydrated to advantage, eliminating the need for 
tin cans, glass jars and sugar, and absolutely doing away 
with the waste resulting from "spoiled" jars. 

Absolutely every bit of the dried fruits and vegetables in 
the train had been "put up" by Mrs. A. Louise Andrea. Mrs. 
Andrea received first prize for everything she canned and 
preserved at the San Francisco fair. Mrs. Andrea spoke 
informally to the groups of interested women who gathered 
around her, answered questions, and explained many of 
her little discoveries which make her work so successful. — 
The News, Newburgh, N. Y. 

Drying of garden products, however, is going to make the 
amount of food stored away for next winter's use much 
larger than it would be otherwise. This old-new idea of 
food drying has taken forcible hold of the American people. 
Revived at this time of imperative need, it has appealed to 
every one through its practicability. Food so prepared is 
wholesome, palatable and extremely cheap. From being the 
preoccupation of scientists, the subject of food drying has 
come to be, next to the war itself, the biggest topic of the 
day. 

Mr. Lou D. Sweet, president of the Potato Association of 
America, says on this subject: "Dehydration has come to 
stay in this country, and those who are familiar with the 
problem of food production and conservation are firm in the 

13 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

opinion that we are seeing only the beginning of what is sure 
to expand into an enormous and important industry. Every 
encouragement, therefore, should be given to home drying, 
in order that the people may become familar with the excel- 
lence of the products which may be prepared by this method, 
and to save the vast quantities of excellent food which goes 
to waste for lack of adequate means of conservation." — 
Charles Lathrop Pack, President, National War Gar- 
den Commission. 

A single pound of dried tomatoes or cabbage is equal to 
10 pounds of the fresh vegetable, and at least that number 
of pounds of the canned. A paper carton of dried tomatoes, 
no larger than a package of breakfast food, and weighing 
2| pounds, is equivalent, in food values, to an entire case 
of canned tomatoes, containing two dozen cans, weighing 
60 pounds. When cooked, each will make the same volume 
of food. 

The use of dried vegetables in caf^s, hotels and clubs 
carries with it many advantages. It enables the chef to 
have on hand, at all times and to meet any emergency de- 
mand, a supply of all varieties of vegetables. The compact- 
ness and lightness of these dried vegetables avoids the ne- 
cessity of maintaining large storage rooms, often refrigerated, 
for a tin of dried vegetables weighing 10 pounds, and occupy- 
ing less than 2 cubic feet of space, will provide enough food 
for a thousand persons at one meal. As the food is non- 
perishable, it can be carried on the pantry shelves indefi- 
nitely without deterioration, and when wanted for use the 
soaking of a few handfuls in water will render the vegetable 
ready for cooking. 

Practically every variety of fresh vegetable is now being 
successfully dried. In the big drying plants on the Pacific 

14 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

coast all kinds of vegetables, berries and fruits are de- 
hydrated. 

The best proof of the utility of evaporated vegetables is 
shown by the kind of institutions which use them. Famous 
hotels, clubs and caf^s from Maine to California are using 
them regularly in their service, and many of the leading 
chefs of the country have testified to the merits of the new 
form of food. In New York the Manhattan and Ritz-Carlton 
hotels use evaporated vegetables, and the same is true of the 
Willard in Washington, the Palace and St. Francis in San 
Francisco, and many others throughout the country. An 
equally large list of prominent clubs and cafes have become 
converted to the new product. 

The owners of ocean-going vessels are also becoming in- 
terested in evaporated vegetables for use in feeding the 
passengers and crews during a voyage. The great saving 
in space, their wide variety, and other advantages have led 
some of the large operating companies on the Pacific coast 
to try out the products, and all of them report the results as 
being most satisfactory. — The Steward, New York. 

The advantages of dehydration are almost too obvious to 
require extended statement. Most evident of all is the loss 
in weight. All the vegetables in common use contain from 
65 to 95 per cent of water. The dehydrated product made 
from these vegetables should contain from 5 to 10 per cent 
of water. There is, therefore, a very large reduction in 
weight and consequent saving in the transportation charges, 
which in general are based upon weight. 

Similarly there is a loss in bulk amounting to from 50 to 
80 per cent of the bulk of the raw material. The importance 
of these factors to railroads in times of congestion such as 
we have just passed through, or to ships in overseas service, 

15 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

is very evident. In the mere matter of sending food to 
armies, one ship could easily carry the vegetable requirements 
which in the green or fresh state would take from 10 to 25 
ships. 

From the standpoint of agriculture the greatest advantage 
of dehydration undoubtedly appears in the stabilization of 
crops and the conservation of materials. Under the present 
conditions we are confronted by either a feast or a famine. 
If we consider potatoes as the most typical root crop, it is a 
matter of experience that a year in which we get a very large 
harvest and consequently low prices is likely to be followed 
by a lean year with a small crop and high prices. This 
pendulum swing goes on decade after decade. With de- 
hydration the excess of the years of great yield can be stored 
up and made available in the following year, when prices 
are higher and the crop much smaller. After a short time 
this would tend to equalize the amount of planting, and, 
other things being equal, to give us year by year a sufficient 
quantity of food materials at normal prices. 

The second great advantage is in the conservation of food 
materials. It is estimated that over 50 per cent of the fruits 
and vegetables grown in this country now never reach the 
consumer, as a result of poor transportation facilities, irregu- 
larities in marketing or other causes. By making use of the 
process of dehydration the second quality materials could 
be preserved by drying, and made available for human 
food and not allowed to rot and waste. Again, taking the 
potato as typical, those of classes 2 and 3 (culls) could be 
used for the manufacture of dehydrated potato and potato 
flour, a product which has not yet received in this country 
the attention which it deserves, but which is now being 
manufactured to some extent in a number of different parts 
of the country. 

16 



REGARDING DEHYDRATION 

A third factor of importance in the relation of dehydration 
to agriculture lies in the fact that a better diversity of crops 
can be secured, and as a result of this there will be a good 
variety of the vegetables which are the equivalent of fresh 
materials available to poor and rich throughout the year. 
This means practically better feeding for the people at large, 
evening up of prices, and the prevention of famine or great 
food shortage as a result of poor crops in any particular 
location. — Maj. S. C. Prescott, United States Depart- 
ment OF Agriculture. 

Dehydration of fruits and vegetables is a field offering great 
possibilities, once processes have been developed to make 
good products. Millions of pounds of water are being carried 
about in this country every day in freight cars at high rates, 
in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables. The water not 
only costs consumers millions of dollars in freight and bulk, 
but is the chief factor in decay and freezing. By good proc- 
esses of dehydration, which are now being perfected, apples 
and berries can be made dry as chips, and potatoes and 
cabbage likewise. A bushel of potatoes in the form of dried 
flakes can be carried home under your arm in a tin can. No 
peeling, no freezing, no decay, no waste. Millions of pounds 
of such potatoes were dehydrated in America and sent to the 
Allies. In a little tin you will soon buy mixtures of dehydrated 
vegetables, six or eight different kinds, for soup. — The 
Saturday Evening Post. 

I am deeply interested in the industry of desiccated vege- 
tables and fruits. I believe that the general use of such 
products by the general public would be highly beneficial. 
The rapidity with which the samples are dried and the low 
temperature employed secure the full value of these products 

17 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

in so far as their vitamine and antiscorbutic properties are 
concerned. — Dr. Harvey W. Wiley. 

In my opinion, gathered from my own experiments and 
the evidence gathered in Germany, the food vakies of dried 
vegetables remain the same as fresh. Regarding the so- 
called vitamines, the leaf vegetables, such as cabbage, spin- 
ach and cauliflower, contain more than do the fruits and 
other vegetables, but owing to the high prices in wintertime 
the consumer with a limited pocketbook is going to buy 
the grain products he considers essential and cut out these 
green leaf vegetables. This is a great mistake. Children par- 
ticularly, and even the grown-ups, need this particular sub- 
stance which occurs in largest amount in these green vege- 
tables which will not be bought by consumers during the 
high-priced season, hence my great interest in the possibility 
of converting these leaf vegetables during the season when 
they are very cheap into an imperishable commodity which 
everybody can buy when fresh vegetables are too expen- 
sive in the winter season. — Professor McCollum of 
Rockefeller Institute of Hygiene.

CHAPTER II 

USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

As intimated previously, almost everything which 
may be eaten can be dehydrated. As a matter of 
fact, I have succeeded with everything but watermelon, 
in which the percentage of moisture is so excessive and 
the cellular structure so delicate that I must exclude 
watermelon from the practicabilities, albeit the rind 
may be dehydrated for future use in pickles and con- 
serves. While it would seem that the tomato comes 
in the "impossible" category, nevertheless, the tomato 
can be dehydrated to good advantage, in quarters if 
the tomatoes are small, or sliced, and then ground 
into powder, if desired, the latter being the best for 
soups and sauces. Directions for making these are 
given elsewhere in this volume. 

Whether for commercial purposes or for home use, 
it must be realized that through dehydration the 
finest and freshest of farm and garden produce is 
always available for the bleak winter months, and 
for use where such produce cannot be grown. One 
can have young, tender beans, fresh peas, sweet corn, 
succulent, tender spinach, tropical dainties and a 
multitude of other food things at any time during 
the winter, and at any i)lace whatever, all preserved 
at their freshest and best, and when cheap and plenti- 
ful. In fact, in many districts produce develops so 

19 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

rapidly and in such abundance during the summer that 
it can be often had for the mere picking, and those 
having farms and gardens may dehydrate in their 
kitchens such small amounts of fruits and vegetables 
as it would not pay to put up by a canning process, 
but which can be saved to perfection and without cost 
by simply using a little home dehydrator over a kitchen 
range. 

Those intending to do dehydration on a commercial 
scale are naturally interested in the possible sources 
of their raw materials and markets for the finished 
goods. I do not think that at first it would be advisable 
to try to sell small package lots to housewives and 
families, for the time and expense involved would 
hardly warrant this. Worth-while quantities may be 
easily sold to hotels, restaurants, clubs, camps, board- 
ing schools, hospitals and other institutions, however, 
and to the supply departments of railroads, steamships 
and sailing vessels. The advantages of such products 
are so many and so obvious that but little salesmanship 
is necessary, for it is a matter of obtaining fresh produce 
which is already cleaned and ready for use, which takes 
up little storage space, and at a positive saving of 
cost and labor to the purchasers. 

The tremendous reduction in space and weight is 
all-important as far as dining cars and ships are con- 
cerned. Many of the latter heretofore have been 
going without fresh fruits and vegetables on account 
of lack of room and refrigeration, to the detriment of 
both passengers and crews. But where a truck load 

20 



USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

of good, fresh produce has been reduced to a mere 
case or barrel, all the previous objections are done 
away with, and dehydrated fruits and vegetables will 
be carried and served, thus preventing scurvy and 
other ailments, and adding materially to the health, 
efficiency and happiness of all concerned. 

To prove my point I am constantly receiving letters 
asking where good dehydrated products can be secured. 
The following, from one of the largest corporations in 
the United States, is an example : — 

Dear Mrs. Andrea : — We are operating a large con- 
cession in South America, and are obliged to transport to 
our workers there commissary supplies. These have to go 
up a long river in gasoline boats and then on mule back. It 
has occurred to us that we might use to advantage dehydrated 
vegetables in this connection, and write you, as we under- 
stand that you have done a great deal of work in connection 
with the dehydration of vegetables, to ask if you can inform 
us the name and address of manufacturers of best grade of 
these products. We will greatly appreciate any information 
you can give us. 

Other profitable channels are opening up, such as 
the furnishing of basic materials for jams, jellies, 
syrups and extracts, for the fruits employed therein 
may be dehydrated and set aside to be used wheii 
convenient, and the resultant products are in no wise 
inferior to those made from the fresh fruits. 

There is no need of worry as to the outcome of 
a dehydration business, properly conducted. In the 
first place, it is dealing with a necessary factor in 

21 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

life, namely, food. No matter what happens, whether 
wars, revolution or business depressions, every one 
must eat. Jewelry, books and even clothing may be 
unsalable at times, but where food of the finest and 
best quality can be supplied in convenient form, and 
at such a saving of labor, spoilage, space, bulk and 
weight, there will always be purchasers aplenty, and as 
dehydrated products become more appreciated, as they 
are bound to be, the number of purchasers will con- 
stantly increase. 

Nor need the competition of home dehydrators be 
feared. While there will be plenty of home dehydra- 
tion done, this will not appreciably affect dehydration 
done on a large and commercial scale any more than 
home canning has prevented packers from doing a 
world-wide business, and in many instances acquiring 
large fortunes. 

In marketing dehydrated products, while little 
argument will have to be used, as the facts speak for 
themselves, there will always be a certain amount of 
demonstration necessary, showing the dehydrated 
product in both its dried and restored forms. Occa- 
sionally a cooked demonstration will be demanded, 
which can be given very easily, quickly and success- 
fully, if done according to directions and recipes given 
later on. 

People are astonished at seeing for the first time how 
wonderfully fruits and vegetables "comx back." 
Indeed, it is a modern food miracle, hence this compari- 
son should be in evidence as a selling factor. 

22 



USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

As it takes a little time to restore the products, it 
is neither convenient nor economical to restore samples 
constantly, for being restored in plain water and 
having come back to their original state or condition 
they will naturally spoil in the course of two or three 
days, just as fresh-cut foods would, and of course in 
hot weather decomposition would take place more 
quicklj^ than during the winter months. 

To have the comparison in convenient and econom- 
ical form, however, you can allow the fruits and vege- 
tables to soak in water for the required time, and 
when they are restored put them into small bottles 
or jars full of fresh water, to which a few drops of 
formaldehyde are added. I have tried many preserva- 
tives and find formaldehyde to be the most satisfactory 
for this purpose. Just a few drops are to be added, 
however, — not more than three drops to a 2-ounce 
bottle, or five or six drops to a half-pint jar. If more 
than this is added the products will darken and lose 
their fresh, attractive appearance. The bottles must 
be tightly corked, while if jars are used rubber rings 
must be employed and sealing done just as in canning. 
Bear in mind, also, that formaldehyde is poison, so these 
display products are not to be eaten, but are merely to 
show how dehydrated foods will "come back." 

In making a selling demonstration, a very con- 
vincing part of the exhibit may be a tin of canned 
spinach purchasable at any store carrying a good 
stock of canned goods. Then in a small open can you 
may have a small amount of spinach dehydrated. In 

23 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

my exhibit I have an ordinary can of spinach which 
contains 1 pound and 14 ounces, as printed on the 
label according to legal requirements. It is a large 
can, No. S size, and adjoining it I have a tiny can of 
dehydrated spinach which contains just as much of 
the actual vegetable as the large can does. This shows 
at a glance the astonishing difference in size, bulk and 
weight between canned and dehydrated goods. More- 
over, the dehydrated spinach, like other foods pre- 
served in this manner, may be kept in a paper bag, a 
cardboard box, jar or other receptacle. The canned 
spinach contains a very large percentage of water, 
which the consumer must pay for, whereas for de- 
hydrated spinach the chef or housekeeper simply 
draws the water from a faucet or well, adding it as 
desired. Furthermore, when the ordinary can of 
spinach has been opened its entire contents must be 
used up quickly or they will spoil, whereas with the 
dehydrated spinach a woman can use any portion she 
pleases, according to the needs of the moment, and 
the rest will keep for some future occasion. I have a 
stock of dehydrated spinach which has been in a 
cardboard container for three years, and it still comes 
back and cooks up perfectly. 

Following this subject of spinach still further, there 
is another advantage of the dehydrated as against the 
basket of fresh spinach for the hotel man or housewife. 
When one buys a basket of spinach there come with 
it roots, dirt and usually many decayed leaves, with 
weeds thrown in for good measure occasionally. Last, 

24 



USES FOR DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS 

but not least, there is the arduous and disagreeable 
task of picking the spinach over, selecting the edible 
portions and then washing them, and unless washed 
very thoroughly and in a certain way the spinach 
will be gritty when it goes on the table. So, in addi- 
tion to the labor involved, by the time the spinach has 
been picked and washed a large portion of it has 
been rejected, whereas the dehydrated product comes 
picked over, cleaned and in compact form all ready 
to cook, for spinach does not need any soaking in 
order to restore it, but the necessary water can be 
added and the cooking proceeded with immediately.

CHAPTER III 

FOR PETS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS 

Our bird and animal friends and their ownei's will 
profit through this new method of preserving grasses, 
herbs, fruits and vegetables. 

As I have already stated, grass can be dehydrated 
and then restored to excellent condition. This will 
be welcome news to many people who have pet cats, 
especially to those living in places where the animals 
are deprived of outdoor exercise and such pasturage 
as even cats love and can obtain here and there in 
winter. To be perfectly healthy a cat needs a little 
grass at times and an occasional morsel of catnip or 
some other herb. 

I have made many cats and their owners happy 
through a little present of some dehydrated grass 
and dehydrated catnip. The grass allowed to soak 
for a couple of hours looks, and doubtless tastes, 
like June grass. Certainly the cats appreciate it, and 
as for the spray of catnip dehydrated and then re- 
stored, the little animals' relish of it is very agreeable 
to behold. 

The same thing holds true with herbs. These have 
a fragrance, flavor and value such as many of the old 
dried herbs cannot possibly furnish, and while I have 
not taken up, as yet, the subject of dehydrated herbs 

26 ^ ' 



FOR ANIMALS 

for general medicinal use, I am satisfied that here is a 
big and profitable field. 

Speaking of grass and other green fodder, it is true 
that silos give many farmers, stock raisers and dairy- 
men an invaluable adjunct. At the same time, there 
are thousands of men owning horses, cows and other 
animals who cannot avail themselves of ensilage, and 
whose animals must sorely miss a taste of green food 
during the long winter months, and really suffer for 
want of it. 

A stock of dehydrated grass, green corn leaves, pea 
pods, turnip-tops and the like would not only be of 
practical value but a real kindness to the animals for 
whose care, comfort and happy condition the owner 
is responsible. 

It is astonishing what a considerable amount of green 
fodder can be reduced to an infinitesimal compass and 
stored in any convenient place, even in a cold building, 
for dehydrated products will not freeze. A little of this 
fodder steeped in tepid water for a short time will be a 
most welcome treat, and will tend toward preventing 
many ailments animals are subject to that are fed 
exclusively upon dried food. 

This brings up a very important potential proposi- 
tion of salvage, utilizing to good purpose pea pods, 
cauliflower leaves and other rejects from canning 
plants and elsewhere. Of course, when considering 
the use of such rejects it is necessary to be assured that 
no disinfectant has been thrown on them, for this is 
sometimes practiced in the case of heaps of outer 

27 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

leaves of vegetables and whatnot in order to prevent 
flies and odors. 

In this connection it is well known how much better 
off hens and chickens are if fed green stuff from time 
to time, whether egg production has to be considered 
or the marketing of poultry for table use. Here is a 
convenient and economical means of adding to the 
poultry rations, not only grass and other leaves, but 
an occasional meal of vegetables, the culls and un- 
marketable produce being useful in this way. When 
dehydrating, however, only fresh and sound stuff 
must be used. Badly wilted or decomposed parts will 
spoil the entire output; but as intimated, vegetables 
too small to market, or that cannot be shipped profit- 
ably in their heavy raw state, may be put to good use 
in this and other ways. 



28 



CHAPTER IV 

DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

We will now consider dehydration in commercial 
or community plants. Such plants have been and are 
being established all over the United States and in 
other countries as well, and various types of dehy- 
drators are being used, — tunnel, kiln and chamber 
driers, some of the latter being portable and others 
equipped with traveling belts instead of trays, this 
with a view to doing away with labor in handling and 
thereby reducing cost. 

As regards the commercial proposition, markets and 
sales require particularly careful consideration. 

A community plant may be conducted on a co-op- 
erative basis, with the idea of supplying local families 
with fruits and vegetables for home use, the idea 
being always to take advantage of summer low prices 
and abundance as against scarcity and high prices 
during winter. 

People bring their produce to the community plant 
where it is treated, either for a cash consideration or 
for a percentage of the produce itself. That is to say, a 
certain portion of everything bought is retained in the 
community plant to pay its operating expenses, and 
the balance returned to the farmer or producer who 
brings it in to be dehydrated. The patrons are en- 
couraged, and in some instances required, to bring 

^9 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

their fruits and vegetables peeled and cut, or otherwise 
prepared before bringing them to the dehydrator. 
The objection to this is, however, the rapid deteriora- 
tion of materials after the protective skins have been 
removed and the cut surfaces exposed. For this 
reason it is better to have peelers and cutters available 
at the plant. And, once for all, the produce must be 
sound and as fresh as possible. Dehydration will not 
save *' turned" or decomposed materials. 

Where the community plant is conducted in an 
ordinary business way the products are sold and a 
division of profits is made, fro rata, with the stock- 
holders, as in any other business, the stockholders 
in this case buying whatever they need from the com- 
munity plant and paying for it just as every one else 
would. In addition to this, if local producers are 
interested in the plant financially, it will tend tow^ard 
assurance of raw material, both as to quality and 
regular supply. 

The managers of community plants, however, must 
assure themselves that those interested fully ap- 
preciate how much raw materials shrink when dehy- 
drated, otherwise there is apt to be suspicion and dis- 
satisfaction. 

People must realize, for example, that a pound of 
fresh carrots comes down to 2 ounces or less upon 
being prepared and dehydrated, it being remembered 
that part of the loss is caused through cleaning and 
peeling, and, with many things, through necessary 
rejection of bruised surfaces. The same reasoning 

30 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

applies to pod and leaf vegetables, so it is not only 
advisable but necessary to give ocular demonstration 
and proof at the very outset. 

Many systems of dehydration are being exploited 
just at present, "most of them bad," as one of the 
foremost experts in the country said to me. 

Dehydration seems so simple and so easy at the 
first glance that many people have gone into the busi- 
ness without due consideration or adequate knowledge. 
Experience shows them, however, that there is a lot 
to learn and many factors to take into account. Hence 
they have obtained consequences instead of results. 

There are different qualities of dehydration, — poor, 
better and best. The first test of a dehydrated product 
is its keeping quality, and then, all-important to the 
consumer, how it restores and tastes when served. 
Poorly dehydrated products will not keep long; fur- 
thermore, they take too much timxC to restore (even 
when they will restore at all), and are then insipid and 
inferior in flavor. In fact, I have countless specimens 
of so-called dehydrated stuff which has been both 
brought and sent to me to find out why it would not 
come back, or why it quickly molded. If overdried 
or dried too slowly the cell walls have been ruptured, 
chemical changes have taken place, and in many in- 
stances an actual cooking has resulted, usually because 
too high a temperature has been employed or too 
much time has been consumed in the process. As for 
the molding, this is generally caused by the inner 
cells retaining too much moisture, and here is one of 

31 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

the points regarding which many dehydrators go 
wrong, as I will explain presently. 

I obtain the best results by starting the dehydration 
at a relatively low temperature, and I insure a perfect 
product by having a certain amount of moisture in 
the dehydrator at first. Relatively good products 
may be obtained without the employment of such 
moisture, or through a one-temperature drying, but 
some initial moisture and raising of temperature will 
be necessary to obtain perfect results, and here is the 
reason. If raw materials are subjected immediately 
to a high, dry temperature there is a very rapid evap- 
oration from the surface or superficial cells, which 
"skin dries" the material, forming practically a glaze 
or coating which prevents the inner cells from liberating 
their moisture as they should do. Consequently when 
the product is apparently dehydrated, the inner cells 
still contain too much moisture, and are still subject 
to enzymic action, besides which this moisture exuding 
later on will furnish a dampness sufficient to allow 
of the superficial molding which has given so many 
people such trouble and loss. At one time hot dry 
air was considered so necessary that attempts were 
made to eliminate moisture from the air by passing it 
through or over some hygroscopic substance such as 
calcium chloride or sulphuric acid, or by heat-drying 
the air before it was admitted to the drying chamber, 
but such methods proved fallacious besides adding 
to the operating costs. 

Dehydration is such a new subject that it is difficult 

32

DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

to find a standard or basis of agreement upon all points 
among those who are experimenting with it. But with 
all due deference to contrary opinions, and after 
having carefully tested many systems and worked 
with the subject for some years, I am able to secure 
the best results by observing the following rules: to 
use radiate heat rather than direct heat; to start 
with the lowest temperature necessary and finish with 
the highest temperature suitable. And, by the way, 
times and temperatures vary for different products. 
But whatever the necessary time or temperature, I 
can only get results satisfactory to myself by starting 
at the minimum temperature and finishing at the 
maximum temperature for each particular product, 
having moisture in the dehydrator for a certain length 
of time, which insures all the cells (both inner and 
outer) being uniformly dehydrated, finishing up with 
the highest heat called for, and dry heat at this latter 
period. 

My conclusions have been formed, as I say, through 
years of tests and at times great discouragements, to 
say nothing of mistakes and the following of theories 
which seemed plausible, but which experience and 
better knowledge of the subject made me discard. I 
still have people calling upon me who maintain that 
immediate, dry, direct heat and just the one tempera- 
ture are all-sufficient. The samples of their products 
force me to disagree with them, and in several in- 
stances I have noticed that the previous ideas of using 
dry, direct heat and a one-temperature process have 

33 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

been abandoned and other dehydration methods have 
been sought after, for it was ascertained, in the pro- 
verbially dear school of experience, that rapid "skin 
drying" means molding later on and imperfect restora- 
tion. 

Further considerations, and essential considerations 
regarding commercial dehydrators handling ton lots 
of produce, are the costs. There are time, fuel, labor 
and other "overheads" to be charged up against the 
products, and I have seen plants where the cost of 
production per finished pound was more than the food 
could be sold for, even though the products were of 
pretty fair quality. Hence, an apparatus which might 
be used profitably in connection with dyes or chemicals 
would not handle food materials economically. There- 
fore, as there is dehydration and dehydration, so 
there are plants and plants, and it is very important 
when considering a plant to go into the matter of 
costs carefully, to say nothing of quality of output, 
and finally to plan and arrange the various steps so that 
there will be no waste action. 

Speaking of heat, radiate heat does give better 
results than direct heat from a furnace. The drying 
is more uniform and evaporation is more gentle and 
regular, all of which has an important bearing upon 
the finished goods. 

Heat, circulation and elimination of moisture are 
such essential factors in dehydration that these three 
coactive points should be carefully considered before 
purchasing any plant or adopting any system. And 

34 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

with a dehydration plant for which a large sum is spent 
and which does not embody these three factors in 
proper relation to each other, and which is so expensive 
to operate that the resultant products cost too much, 
loss and disappointment are the certain consequences, 
in which event it is not fair to blame dehydration and 
its principles. 

Some people rely upon huge blowers. These have 
the fault of sweeping air so rapidly over the cut surfaces 
of the materials that "skin drying" or surface coating 
is often caused thereby; besides which the use of too 
much power or waste heat means an unnecessary fuel 
expenditure. The best products that I have found 
are obtained by a suction or drawing of the air, giving 
a slight vacuum effect, or by a process in which the 
fanning or blowing seems almost insignificant at first 
sight, but, which nevertheless, circulates the air in the 
dehydrator quite sufficiently, and the radiate heat, 
together with the correct amount of moisture elimina- 
tion, afford results which are eminently satisfactory. 

The Vacuum Process 

While vacuum dehydrators are excellent for many 
substances, no doubt, I have yet to be convinced that 
they are practicable, commercially speaking, as far 
as vegetables are concerned. 

From what I have seen, the equipment is elaborate 
and quite expensive. This system requires a cham- 
ber containing steam-heated shelves, together with 

35 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

a vacuum pump and the necessary heating appa 
ratus. 

As it is impossible to set an exact time for the de- 
hydration of any one material, it is necessary, with this 
system, to "turn off the vacuum" and open the cham- 
ber in order to inspect the material, and then to reseal 
and re-establish the vacuum in case the product is 
not ready for removal. Moreover, all this may have 
to be done more than once, and in case too high a 
vacuum is used the materials are apt to be shattered 
severely. In fact, I have seen foods treated by this 
process which were puffed up and blistered in many 
places, and in other materials the cellular structure 
was obviously broken down, although this may have 
been the fault of the operator and not of the system. 

It is claimed for the vacuum process that fish and 
meats dehydrated thereby do not undergo protein 
coagulation, but for that matter I have seen fish and 
meats of various kinds dehydrated perfectly by other 
processes, and the delicate flavors and aromas of fruits 
and vegetables retained just as well. 

Despite the foregoing, however, I do believe that a 
good, commercial vacuum dryer will be procurable. In 
fact, I am to test one that is nearly finished and very 
promising. 

Regarding Appearance of Products 

While it is most important to furnish or produce 
dehydrated foods that will restore and cook perfectly 

36 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

as to flavors, colors and other qualities, we must not 
overlook the necessity of attractive appearance when 
dehydration has been accomplished, as this means 
salability and demand. I am very sure that people 
would hesitate before buying, and even refuse to buy, 
dehydrated foods that were badly discolored and dis- 
agreeable looking. As a matter of fact, I have seen 
dehydrated stuff which restored and cooked very well 
indeed, but which was so dingy and dark and unat- 
tractive in the packages that most people would not 
take it as a gift, even though the producer knew that 
it would look well and taste good after restoration or 
rehydration. 

Really precooked stuff does not look attractive, but, 
on the other hand, manj^ raw materials treated with a 
little steaming before dehydration do look attractive 
and promising, and, when shown in connection with 
some of the same things restored, it is an easy matter 
to convince prospective purchasers. 

The drying should stop when the product is leathery 
and when no moisture can be squeezed out from the 
ends of pieces after breaking. The "brittle" stage 
may be reached during the conditioning later; but 
the products must not be dried "brittle" in the dryer. 

In order to set color and texture, steam blanching is 
advisable. In other words, mt)st raw materials should 
be subjected to a brief period of steaming. This is 
called "blanching," a canner's term, and although 
I do not like the word blanching, as it is commonly 
used, I am following the precedent. 

37 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Blanching may be done in boiling water, but then 
the materials lose some of their nutrients, whereas 
by blanching in steam nothing is lost and the color is 
intensified. Take the case of Brussels sprouts, for 
example. Cut the sprouts in half lengthwise and 
then dehydrate some without blanching and others 
after being steam-blanched. You will find that the 
blanched sprouts look much better upon the comple- 
tion of dehydration; also they restore more quickly, 
and even look better when cooked. 

The blanching should be quickly done. The truck 
containing the trays can be run into a steam chamber, 
left in for a brief period, and then be immediately 
placed in the dehydrator, which should be ready 
heated to the starting temperature. As soon as fruits 
and vegetables are peeled and cut they become subject 
to chemical changes, decomposition and the action of 
bacteria, yeasts and molds, so prompt action is nec- 
essary to arrest and avert undesirable change and 
destructive action. 

If no steaming apparatus is available and blanching 
must be done in boiling water, the material should be 
placed in a wire basket and active boiling be assured 
for the time necessary for each material. 

While approximate times and tables are given later 
on in this book, it must be understood that the times 
can only be approximate, for the produce varies ac- 
cording to the season, soil in which grown, and its 
staleness or freshness, and, of course, the way in which 
it is cut, — slices, cubes, strips and their relative 

38 



DEHYDRATING IN LARGE QUANTITIES 

thickness. Hence judgment must be exercised, but 
a little experience will soon enable one to determine 
the exact length of time for blanching, and, as ex- 
plained later on, for the dehydration process itself. 

Another question comes up, and that is the matter 
of cold-dipping. This means quickly dipping the 
blanched materials into cold water. Immediately 
after blanching, the materials are plunged into cold 
water, then quickly taken out, drained for a few mo- 
ments and placed in the dehydrator. It is said to set 
the color, the shock destroys certain bacteria, and that 
some products restore quicker after undergoing the 
cold-dip. So, while the cold-dip may be used, if de- 
sired, I have discarded it as of no particular advantage. 

After the products are removed from the dehydrator 
there is a process very essential, which has been called 
"conditioning" or "curing." 

This means that the product is to be exposed in trays 
or bins for a time, and it should be covered carefully 
with cheesecloth, for the greatest care must be exer- 
cised to prevent insects getting at the material that 
is "conditioning;" otherwise infestation is probable, 
with disastrous consequences. There are moths which 
particularly favor dehydrated fruits and vegetables, 
and consider them ideal media in which to lay their 
eggs. These eggs would hatch later, and the grub 
worms, or larvae, would rapidly cause havoc in the 
product. Hence it is most important that the strictest 
precautions be observed. I have found that 72 hours 
is sufficient time for conditioning, and in this time the 

39 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

products dry out still further, so that is another reason 
why they should not stay in the dehydrator until 
brittle, but rather come out leathery, although suffi- 
ciently dry. 

The dehydrator and conditioning rooms must be 
kept immaculately clean; windows and doors should 
be screened, and I would advocate a thorough steriliza- 
tion of the entire plant at brief intervals. Moreover, 
while "conditioning," the products should be kept in 
a relatively cool, dark place and eternal vigilance be 
exercised to exclude the troublesome moth pests. 
Moreover, darkness prevents the products bleaching 
out, and for this reason it is advisable to have screens 
or shutters whereby the light can be excluded when 
desired. 

During "conditioning" the product should be turned 
over twice a day so as to let the air get at it uniformly, 
and while this "conditioning" may seem like a trivial 
matter, again I say that it is most necessary. 

Auxiliaries such as peelers and cutters may be em- 
ployed to good advantage, depending largely upon 
quantity handled and labor costs, and, as with every- 
thing else, there are poor, good and best machines for 
this purpose.

CHAPTER V 

PACKING AND PRESERVATION 

The matter of sulphuring is a much-disputed point. 
Some people advocate it, while others are violently 
opposed to it. Those who favor it claim that it is not 
injurious to health, while their opponents assert that 
it is. 

Be that as it may, how long does sulphuring protect 
fruits and vegetables against insect attack? We have 
all seen sun-dried apricots, etc., horribly infested, 
although these products have admittedly been sul- 
phured. 

At present, therefore, sulphurization would seem to 
be a matter of personal predilection. 

Generally speaking, apples, apricots, pears and 
peaches are sulphured before drying in order to pre- 
vent discoloration, and in many cases, after sun drying, 
to destroy the grub worms with which they have be- 
come infested during the process. 

As 1 have stated previously, I am not advocating 
the use of sulphur, and when we read that during the 
war the government specifications called for non- 
sulphured potatoes, it is readily seen that sulphuring 
is not looked upon with favor generally. There are 
those, however, who wish to employ sulphur, especially 
with potatoes, so for that reason I will say that one 
producer whom 1 know very well says that he uses 

41 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

250 pounds of sulphur to 100,000 pounds of sliced or 
cubed potatoes, these being all ready for the dehydrator. 
Moreover, he employs just a suggestion of sulphur 
fume in the dehydrator during the entire process, al- 
though the main sulphuring is done before the potato 
goes into the dehydrating chamber, and he states that 
sulphurization effectually prevents enzymic action, 
so that while the blanched product will ferment in 
humid climates the sulphured potato will not. 

In using sulphur judgment must be exercised and 
allowances made for whether the product is new or 
old, and how thickly the trays are loaded. 

In dealing with sulphured potatoes ultimately, it is 
very important that they should be cooked in steam 
instead of boiling water, as when cooked in boiling 
water they become slimy and have a disagreeable 
effect, which can be removed, however, by putting the 
pieces in a sieve or colander, after cooking, and letting 
hot water run through them. 

Sulphuring is an easy matter for those who wish 
to employ the process, but it should be done out of 
doors, as the fumes are very disagreeable. 

For small quantities of material a wooden box large 
enough to enclose the trays, one over the other, may be 
used, the lowest tray being a few inches above the 
ground. Sulphur can be placed in a metal container 
and ignited, but the product should not be left over the 
fumes longer than is necessary. 

For large quantities a wooden receptacle can be 
constructed which will hold anywhere from 8 to 15 

42 



PACKING AND PRESERVATION 

trays, — in fact, the average truck load of trays, — 
and the sulphur employed as just stated, some pro- 
ducers fuming for 10 minutes, while others advocate 
as much as 25 or 30 minutes. 

Dipping fruits to prevent discoloration has been 
tried extensively, chlorate of potash, permanganate 
of potash, sulphate of magnesia, chloride of lime, 
peroxide of hydrogen, etc., being used in different 
strengths, but none of these has proved satisfactory. 

Some people engaged in commercial dehydration sub- 
ject the products just before packing, or in the open 
packages, to a temperature of 180° to 185° F. for a 
period of from 3 to 5 minutes, in order to sterilize 
them. The material is put into cold chambers and the 
temperature is then quickly raised to the required 
degree. If in an oven the door should be left slightly 
open. Seal packages immediately after sterilizing. 

Regarding packages there are many forms of commer- 
cial cartons used, vegetables like potatoes and beans, 
which do not stain, being put up in ordinary paper car- 
tons, while berries and the like are put into cartons 
which are paraffined. There is also a very good pack- 
age, grease-proof, which is silica lined and waxed on 
the outer surfaces, and the reports I receive as to it 
are very favorable. There are also tin cans sealed 
under a vacuum process after being packed, while 
other cans have covers which can be pried open and 
snapped shut again. For moist, tropical climates cans 
may be necessary and probably are, but, generally 
speaking, dehydrated products keep better if the 

43 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

packages allow of some circulation of air, although 
they must be insect proof. 

For home use, paper bags securely tied and pref- 
erably paraffined, ordinary cardboard boxes, crocks, 
wooden pails, etc., may be utilized, but the packages 
must be kept in a dry place and preferably at a mod- 
erate temperature.

CHAPTER VI 

DEHYDRATING FOODS IN THE HOME 
Followed by General Hints and Data 

A good little home deliydrator is a useful and val- 
uable article. It will prevent internment in the kitchen 
and standing over a hot stove, for you can put your 
fruits and vegetables into it, use your little dehydra- 
tor on your range or stove, and practically no more 
attention is necessary until the time is up for the 
product to have finished drying. In this way you can 
save both small and large amounts of summer food 
materials, obtained when they are cheap and plenti- 
ful, for use next winter in so perfect a degree that they 
will be as tasty and delicious as when fresh picked. 

Furthermore, if you still want to have home-canned 
fruits and vegetables of your own, and good jams, 
jellies and preserves, you can make these up in winter, 
and at any time most convenient to yourself, from the 
products which you have dehydrated during the 
summer, for from the products which you have de- 
hydrated during the summer you can do your canning 
and conserving just as perfectly as if you did it at 
the time you got the fresh product. 

In order to satisfy myself that dehydrated products 
would do anything that fresh produce would do, I 
tested them out in every way, including canning, and 
in consequence I have a complete stock of canned 

45 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

fruits and vegetables, perfect jellies, jams, marmalades 
and conserves of every kind, all from dehydrated 
materials. 

Where a coal range is being used constantly, the home 
dehydrator very soon pays for itself by affording the 
means of saving small lots of fruits and vegetables which 
might be lost or thrown away but for dehydration. 

It does not pay to put up just a small lot of stuff 
in glass jars, for there is so much work involved, — the 
sterilizing of jars, rubbers and tops, then the filling 
and emptying of the hot-water bath and other inci- 
dentals, whereas the fruits or vegetables on hand may 
be cut as desired, placed on the trays in the dehydrator 
and the drying down on the top of the range, where- 
upon no close attention is necessary. When the time 
is up the produce may be examined, and if dehydra- 
tion is completed the material may be set in a shallow 
pan or other cheesecloth-covered receptacle and put in a 
cool, dark place to condition for three days or so, stirring 
the stuff a couple of times daily so as to allow uniform 
curing. A cheesecloth covering is very advisable. 

If comparatively large amounts are to be dehydrated 
at home, a regular day's work can be devoted to this 
purpose, and as the dryer may be filled and emptied 
two or three times a day, it will be realized that a large 
amount of good farm or garden produce may be set 
aside to be used during the following winter, where- 
upon it will be found to be as delicious as the fresh- 
picked, — that is, if it has been properly dehydrated, 
— a simple matter, after all. 

46 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

There are as many theories about home dehydration 
as there are about home dryers. I do not think it is 
worth while to go into the details of these various 
theories, so I will tell what means and methods I 
have personally found to be the best, after several 
years of doing dehydration in my kitchen. 

The very first, and a most important, consideration 
is the dryer itself. You cannot get satisfactory results 
from a dryer which is not built on correct principles, 
and w^hich works against Nature's laws, as many of 
the little dryers do. 

As I said earlier in this volume, drying and dehy- 
dration are not the same thing. I think it will be well 
to give my reasons again for making that statement. 

Everything is composed of tiny cells, each cell 
containing flavoring essentials, coloring matter and 
nutritive properties, and of course a relatively large 
amount of fluid. By dehydration you quickly draw 
the water or fluid through the cell walls or membranes 
without rupturing the cell walls. Thus you leave 
everything in the cells except the water, and this can 
be restored by allowing the products to soak in water 
for a certain length of time, when they will take back 
all or nearly all of the water that was originally ex- 
tracted. Whereas mere drying is a long, slow process, 
and after a time the cell walls crack and allow the 
volatiles to escape and chemical changes to take place, 
so that you lose flavor, coloring and other properties. 

To dehydrate, whether it be on a large commercial 
scale in ton lots, or in small quantities in the home, 

47 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

you must have a certain degree or degrees of heat, 
neither too Httle nor too much, for if the temperature 
is too low you do not extract your moisture rapidly 
enough, and if the temperature is too high you break 
the cells and even cook the produce, and if it is once 
cooked it will never restore to a nice fresh flavor, 
appearance and condition. 

So you must have the requisite heat; also a good 
circulation of air and an efiicient means of taking 
away the moisture that is liberated from the cells, 
and this must be done quite rapidly and continuously. 

Hence while drying can be done in an oven, dehydra- 
tion is impossible thereby, for the necessary circula- 
tion and prompt removal of moisture cannot be ob- 
tained. Consequently the stuff bakes or else cooks in 
its own steam. 

I have tested something like twenty home dryers, 
but I have found that most of them lack the necessary 
qualifications whereby good products can be assured. 
As I have stated already, in order to dehydrate prop- 
erly there must be a certain amount of heat, a circula- 
tion of air and a continuous means of removing the 
moisture that is liberated by evaporation. The ma- 
jority of the home dryers are painfully lacking in these 
respects. Many of them do not give uniform dehydra- 
tion, even on one tray, and taking the trays through- 
out, you will find that the product on some of the 
trays is hardly warmed through, while the material on 
the other trays is overdried or even scorched. 

When you have a dryer with trays set above each 

48 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

other and with an open bottom, which is placed on a 
coal range or over a gas or oil burner, the materials 
on the lowest trays become warmed first, and as the 
moisture is liberated it rises and upon coming into 
contact with the cooler materials on the upper trays 
the moisture condenses and precipitates. Thus you are 
working against yourself. Of course, this can be ob- 
viated to a certain extent by changing the trays from 
time to time, but this requires work and attention 
which are not always convenient. However, there is 
a home dryer which does away with the need of this 
work and fussing. It is a simple and inexpensive little 
dehydrator which you place over the source of heat, 
and beyond looking at the thermometer inside once or 
twice during the process of drying, no more attention 
is necessary. Furthermore, this little dryer is equipped 
with a deflector or radiator which distributes the heat 
and so helps to prevent scorching or cooking when 
placed over the direct flame of a gas or oil burner. 

Speaking of this particular little home dehydrator, 
one of the greatest food authorities in the United States 
called at my testing kitchen and saw the dehydrator 
operating, and also examined the splendid products 
emanating therefrom. He wrote an article for one of 
the leading New York newspapers, in which he said 
that "this little cheap device makes use of a scientific 
principle which is foolproof in its operation and which 
turns out the finest foods I have ever seen." 

It is always well to have a thermometer, for then 
you can be assured that you are employing the proper 

49 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

degree of heat as per the temperatures given with the 
approximate time-tables in this book. Guessing at the 
temperature is a mistake, for then you can neither be 
sure of quahty of your product nor the time to leave 
it in the dehydrator. It is well to be as exact as possi- 
ble, so obtain a thermometer with a flat back, and 
after putting the dehydrator on the range or stove 
with the heat on, place the thermometer on one of 
the lower trays, and see that it registers the proper 
degree of heat before you put your produce into the 
dehydrator. 

I found it well to have a little moisture in the bottom 
of the dehydrator so that the outer surfaces of the cut 
materials will not become glazed over, as they will if 
dry heat is immediately applied. That "skin drying" 
prevents the moisture from the interior of the pieces 
getting out as it should. Consequently, when the 
product feels quite dry and you might think it was 
dehydrated throughout, there is still enough interior 
moisture to cause a fermentation and eventually form 
a mold on the surfaces by slowly coming through. 
I have seen cubed carrots, for example, which were 
quite brittle and which would snap in two, and many 
would judge that these carrots were sufficiently de- 
hydrated, but upon peeling off the outer surfaces the 
cubes would bend instead of snapping, and one could 
promptly see that the middle of the cubes had not 
been thoroughly dried. 

In the case of produce with which it is advisable to 
use moisture, I put a shallow pan of boiling water in 

50

after drying 2.5 pounds 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

the bottom of this little home dehydrator, which is 
arranged for this purpose, and I leave the water in for 
half an hour. This gives a certain amount of humidity 
which keeps the cut materials from becoming glazed 
over or seared, and permits of their being warmed 
throughout, — the pores all being opened, so to speak, 
— uniform moisture liberation being assured. At the 
end of the half hour I remove the pan of hot water and 
allow the dehydration process to take its natural course, 
finishing with a fairly high and dry heat. (See approxi- 
mate time and heat tables.) 

Now to mention blanching and cold-dipping in con- 
nection with home work. I have dealt with this in my 
previous chapters upon dehydration, so in case you 
have not read them I would refer you to those chapters, 
as blanching assures the maintenance of pretty colors, 
especially the green shades. 

For blanching at home a special steamer is not 
necessary. You may do the steam blanching in the 
washboiler, as directed later. After taking the tray 
out of the boiler, shake gently for a few moments to 
allow it to drain, then insert the tray into the de- 
hydrator, which has previously been brought up to 
the starting temperature as given in the time-table. 

Manipulating the trays in this way saves a lot of 
handling and possible breakage of the product, and 
you thus obtain a nicer looking and a better dehydrated 
product. 

In the table, where no blanching time is given, you 
will understand that it is purposely omitted. Regard- 

51 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

ing the produce which I have found it advisable to 
blanch, I mention a special time in each instance. 

Only a day or two ago I made another test while 
dehydrating a quantity of Brussels sprouts. Half of 
them I blanched and set into the dryer without cold- 
dipping. The rest I blanched and cold-dipped, but 
found that the cold-dipped ones took from 20 minutes 
to a half hour longer to dehydrate than did the ones 
that were not cold-dipped. The explanation for this 
is that the second lot, having been cooled off by the 
dipping, required a certain amount of warmth before 
dehydration could proceed, and, possibly, "the pores 
having to be opened." It is analogous to what we 
experience in a Turkish bath, the pores being opened 
in the hot room and then closed by a plunge into the 
cold-water tank. I do not use cold-dipping. 

After removing your product from the dehydrator, 
be sure to allow it to cure or "condition" three days 
and nights, stirring twice a day or so, so as to allow 
the air to influence throughout and evenly, and then 
pack away in cardboard boxes, lard pails or other 
receptacles, making sure that they are covered tightly 
enough to keep out insects of all kinds, but not so 
that they will be absolutely air-tight. I have seen de- 
hydrated products that were kept in glass jars, tightly 
sealed with rubbers, just as in home canning, but 
materials kept in that way have a rather musty odor, 
and do not have as good a flavor as foods kept in 
packages which are not air-tight. 

I wish that I could give exact times for dehydrating 

52 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

(as absolutely as I am able to do for home canning), 
but this is impossible, since fruits and vegetables vary 
so much according to their freshness and whether they 
are grown in sandy or clay soils, or in wet or dry seasons. 
Moreover, there is the cutting to consider, as to whether 
they are cut into very thin slices, strips or cubes, or 
into relatively thick pieces. While approximate times 
can be given and are given, the final test is through an 
examination of the materials. When they are leathery 
and no moisture appears upon breaking a piece and 
squeezing the ends, then it is safe to say that dehydra- 
tion is complete. The material should not be brittle 
as it comes from the dehydrator, although it may be- 
come so after a few hours or days, which is all right 
then. 

Furthermore, every piece or strip will not be dried 
to exactly the same stage, but during "conditioning" 
and turning over they average up, some which are a 
little too dehydrated perhaps absorbing moisture from 
those which have not been quite suflSciently dehy- 
drated, the latter giving out their little surplus of 
moisture, so that it may be said to average into proper 
state. For this and other reasons the "conditioning'* 
is a very important matter and should never be neg- 
lected. I say this after having tested products in 
two ways, — one "conditioned" as aforesaid, and the 
other being packed into closed receptacles directly 
after taking the stuff out of the dehydrator. To 
further assure myself on this point I have even put 
the dehydrated products directly from the dehydrator 

53 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

into tin cans, sealing them hermetically forthwith, 
also into vacuum jars; but after restoring and cooking, 
my preference is decidedly in favor of the air "condi- 
tioned" product. 

As many raw materials reduce, approximately, from a 
pound to an ounce or so through peeling, trimming and 
dehydrating, it will be readily seen what a saving of 
space is assured by this process, and if the packages 
are stored m a dark, dry place, at a moderate tem- 
perature, and the contents have been properly de- 
hydrated, there is little danger of spoilage, although 
it is just as well to use up everything the following 
winter. Yet I have some stocks of dehydrated fruits 
and vegetables which have been kept for three years 
or more, and are still in perfect condition. 

A Time-table 

All fruits and vegetables should be cut uniformly 
so that dehydration will be even throughout. They 
should be as fresh as possible, and all wilted and 
decayed portions should be removed. 

The following time-table is the one used in a de- 
hydrating plant where very good products are turned 
out in large quantities from a chamber tray system. 
And here most of the fruits and vegetables are sliced 
or shredded not to exceed one-eighth inch in thickness. 
Even these times depend somewhat on the condition of 
the raw materials, and where heavier slices or shreds 
are used the drying times must be increased accordingly.

DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Fish and Meats 

Fish and meats should be dried at relatively low 
temperatures, otherwise coagulation will result. 

Fatty portions and connective tissues should be 
removed. 

When fresh these materials will dry quicker than 
when previously frozen. Moreover, they will restore 
better. 

They should be restored in cold water. 

Codfish dries well in both the commercial or home 
dryers, either as steaks or in flakes. Time, about 5 
hours, maximum temperature, 130° F. Dip fish in 
weak brine solution for 15 minutes, dry without 
rinsing in clear water, and dehydrate. 

The "lean" fish dehydrate well, but the oily kinds, 
such as salmon, cannot be dried as easily or as well 
until one has acquired experience and technique. 

Oysters and clams dry out well, temperature not to 
exceed 130° F. Suitable for chowders or stews. These 
products may be restored in cold milk. 

Good results are obtained by first dipping meat in 
soya bean or other oil of good food value. After 
dehydration the meat should be dipped into warm 
water, 130° F. or thereabouts, in order to rid it of 
the oil. Then return to dryer long enough to get rid 
of the surface moisture.

Sugar beets may be dehydrated, stored and the 
sugar extracted therefrom as and when convenient. 

A good deal of spoiled product comes through the 
carelessness or negligence of employees. It is well, 
therefore, to have thermostatic temperature regula- 
tion and other automatic devices wherever possible. 

Fruits cut into halves should be dried with the cut 
side up, or they will lose valuable juices. 



63 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

If okra, string beans and peas are blanched in boiling 
water, a half teaspoon of soda to each gallon of water 
helps to set the color. 

To prevent apple, pear, apricot and peach from dis- 
coloring, drop the pieces, as cut, into cold water con- 
taining lemon juice or salt, — juice of 1 lemon to 3 
quarts of water, or 3 level tablespoons of salt to 1 
gallon of water. These fruits should not be blanched. 

Bell peppers may be peeled quickly by placing them 
in a pan and heating in the oven until the skins blister, 
whereupon the skins can be readily pulled off. 

Dehydrated mashed potato may be obtained and 
stocked by boiling potatoes until tender, pressing 
through a ricer on to the trays and drying until crisp. 

Large stalks, as with spinach, should be cut from the 
leaves, dried separately and mixed in later; otherwise 
the leaves will become overdried while the stalks are 
being dehydrated. 

Cut cauliflower "flowerets" into halves or slices. 
Dry separately from the stalks. The stalks make 
good soup stock, but the leaf parts should be removed. 

It is well to spread the trays with cheesecloth when 
treating bananas and the like. Acid fruits should not 
come into contact with the metal tray bottoms, neither 
should tomatoes. 

Onion slices should be cut across, otherwise the mem- 
branous "onion skin" may prevent uniform drying. 

If large berries are to be dried whole, they should be 
pierced lengthwise. A steel knitting needle will serve 
the purpose. 

64 



DEHYDRATING HINTS AND DATA 

Corn on the cob can be dehydrated, but the centre 
of the cob must be bored out. Corn dried in this 
way takes too long to dry and to restore to be prac- 
ticable. 

Changes of flavors, or rather addition of flavors, 
may be produced by blowing in fine powders during 
drying, — mint, for example; many novel and appetiz- 
ing effects are thus made possible. 

When prunes, peaches and other fruits are dipped 
into hot lye solution, the dipping basket should there- 
after be plunged into cold, fresh water so as to wash 
off the lye. 

Fruits must be well ripened but not soft, and well 
sorted and picked over. When paring and slicing are 
done, exposure to air is to be avoided. Rapid, con- 
tinuous work and fresh, sound produce are necessary 
for the best results. 

As regards soup mixtures, the components must be 
dried separately and then mixed as desired, taking 
care to use materials that will all restore and cook 
up equally or nearly so. Whole peas and beans require 
longer soaking than the usual soup vegetables; conse- 
quently, they should be avoided in the original com- 
bination, although they may be added, if desired, after 
longer and separate soaking, and then cooked in. A 
popular combination is turnips, carrots, onions, cab- 
bage, celery, potatoes and a little parsley, while some 
producers add leek, tomato and green pepper. The 
proportions or percentages vary considerably.

CHAPTER VII 

DIRECTIONS FOR HOME DEHYDRATING 
(VEGETABLES) 

To obtain the very best dehydrated products, see 
that only first quahty food is used. Those that are 
young and tender, in other words, "in prime condi- 
tion," will, when soaked, restore to a first-class product. 

The first step is the cleansing. Thoroughly wash 
so that no grit, dirt or sand is left. Then scrape or 
pare to remove skins, with such vegetables as potatoes, 
carrots, etc., or shell to remove pods from peas, lima 
beans, etc. 

The second step is cutting the product into the 
desired shape, such as slicing, cubing, dicing or shred- 
ding. To facilitate the work the drying tray should 
stand under the cutting machine, so that the cut 
product drops directly onto the tray. 

The third step is blanching. A wash boiler is excel- 
lent for this, and will hold the small trays of most 
home dryers. Blanching is as important for home 
dehydrating as it is for home canning, and is done for 
practically the same reasons, namely, to kill certain 
bacteria, to improve the color and to soften the texture 
slightly. 

Blanching is best done in steam, as there is less loss 
of mineral salts than when boiling water is used.

HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

To steam-blanch, place four tall, clean tin cans in 
the boiler, partly fill these with boiling water to hold 
them steady so that the edges of the tray will rest on 
them, then add boiling water to the boiler to a depth 
of 3 inches, and when the water is boiling lower the 
tray so that it rests on the cans, and cover boiler 
tightly; or else use hooks to suspend the trays. 
Water should not be so high that it will touch the 
product when in active motion. 

Have a clock in sight when blanching and remove 
the product when the time is reached. 

The fourth step is to place the tray of blanched 
material into the dryer, which should have been heated 
to the required temperature; and let me caution you 
that there must be no "guesswork" as to this tem- 
perature. A small and inexpensive thermometer is 
necessary. Place this in the dryer, and when the 
correct temperature is reached and the fire so regu- 
lated that the desired temperature is maintained^ 
place the material in the dryer. The regulating of the 
temperature should be started sufficiently early, so 
that there may be no delay after the blanching is 
done. 

The fifth step in home dehydrating is called "condi- 
tioning." After your product has reached its dried 
stage it is then placed in a rack or pan and set in a 
cool, dry place for three days. During this period the 
dried product is poured into another container once 
or twice each day. This mixes it and allows all parts 
to dry evenly. If there are no screens on doors and 

67 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

windows, be sure to place a piece of clean cheesecloth 
over the product during the "conditioning" period. 
This prevents any insects from alighting on the food 
and depositing their eggs. If this should happen, then 
look out for worms and trouble. 

The sixth and last step is storing. Home-dried 
foods can be stored in clean boxes, heavy paper bags, 
cartons that can be sealed against insects, paraffined 
containers, cans, etc. After packing the foods keep 
them in a cool, dry closet or room. 

When is the Product Dry? 

The best test I find is to break or cut a piece in two, 
and press the cut edge between the fingers. If no 
moisture is noticeable it is sufficiently dry. 

Length of Time for Drying 

This can be given only approximately, as varieties 
of the same product differ in their drying time. 

Again, the age of the product has a great deal to do 
as regards the time required; also how thick the slices 
are cut. The larger the surface that is exposed to the 
heat, naturally the less time is required for evapora- 
tion of the moisture. Likewise some home dryers may 
take longer than others. In my kitchen we have 
noticed a difference of nearly an hour when using the 
same product on different kinds of home dryers, to say 
nothing of quality of finished product. 

I would advise that you keep a careful record of 

68 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

your drying time and use this as a guide for your next 
summer's work. 

In all home drying the temperature must be raised 
very gradually. The degree of heat first mentioned 
should be maintained for about a quarter of the whole 
drying time. With few exceptions, such as herbs 
and leaf products, the drying time is usually of several 
hours' duration. From this you can see that the 
product is kept for some time at the opening or start- 
ing temperature, and then the heat increased 10 
degrees for another period, and so on until the finish- 
ing heat is reached. A very little experimenting with 
one product will give you an idea as to how the heat 
affects it. 

Beets 

Select beets that are young. Leave all the root and 
3 inches of the top on the beet. Wash carefully and 
place in boiling water, leaving in the water until the 
skin can be slipped off with the hands. This can be 
determined by trying a single beet. Dip beets in cold 
water a minute, drain and remove skins. At same 
time cut away any blemish. Slice vegetable one- 
eighth inch in thickness onto the trays, and place 
each tray in the dryer as soon as prepared. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 



69 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Beets are sufficiently dry when there can be no 
moisture pressed from them. The length of time 
depends upon the age of the vegetable. A young 
beet without a woody center will dry quicker than an 
old one. 

** Condition " as directed on page 67. 

Beet Greens 

Prepare and dry as directed for Spinach. (See 
page 82.) 

Brussels Sprouts 

Look over vegetable, remove all decayed or wilted 
leaves. Wash in cold water, drain, cut in halves length- 
wise and place on trays. Blanch in steam as directed 
on page 67 for 3 minutes, counting time from moment 
cover is placed on boiler. Remove tray, shake to drain 
and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 

The sprouts are sufficiently dried when no moisture 
can be pressed from a cut end. The light leaves in 
center of vegetable may discolor during drying, but 
will restore to their natural color. 

''Condition" as directed on page 67.

Beans 

Select stringless variety, remove stems and tips. 
Wash in cold water, drain and cut lengthwise into even 
sizes. Place on trays about 1 inch deep, and blanch 
in steam from 3 to 5 minutes. Remove tray, shake to 
drain and place in dryer. 



Starting temperature, 110 F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 

Beans are sufficiently dried when no moisture can 
be pressed out. 

"Condition," as directed on page 67. 

Lima beans are shelled, placed on trays and blanched 
from 3 to 5 minutes, depending upon age of the prod- 
uct. Remove tray, shake to dry and place in dryer. 



Starting temperature, 110 F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 3^ to 4| hours. 

Drying test is the same as for stringless beans. 

"Condition," as directed on page 67. 

Wax beans are treated the same as stringless beans. 

Cabbage 

Remove outside wilted and decayed leaves and cut 
away the stalks. Slice cabbage, from one-eighth to 
one-fourth inch thick, directly onto the trays so 

71 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

the product lies about 1 inch in thickness on the trays. 
Blanch in steam S minutes, shake to remove water 
and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 135° F. 
Approximate time, about 3§ to 4 hours. 

Cabbage is sufficiently dry when no moisture can be 
pressed from stalk portions. Do not increase tempera- 
ture too rapidly or the leaves will not retain their light 
color. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Carrots 

Select young, tender carrots. Wash with brush in 
water, scrape and wash again. Cut crosswise into 
one-eighth inch thick slices, or lengthwise into slices. 
Pile slices one on another and return them to slicing 
machine for cutting into Julienne strips. Place cut 
carrots on trays and steam-blanch for 3 minutes, re- 
move trays, shake to drain and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 2| to 4 hours. 

If a piece of carrot is broken and no moisture can be 
pressed out, the product is ready to come from dryer. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

The Julienne strips will dry somewhat quicker than 
the slices. Carrots may also be cut into one-fourth 

72 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

inch cubes. If one vegetable is cut into different 
shapes, each should be dried on separate trays to give 
a uniform product. 

Cauliflower 

Select large, firm, white heads and immerse flower 
side down for 1 hour in a bowl of cold salted water to 
draw out any insects. Then rinse and drain. Separate 
the head into flowerets, cutting off the large stems. 
Every part should be cut into slices one-eighth inch 
thick. Place prepared vegetable on trays, about an 
inch thick, and steam-blanch for 3 minutes. Remove 
from steam, shake a moment and place in dryer. The 
flowerets should be cut lengthwise. 



Starting temperature, 110 F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 4 to 6 hours. 

Cauliflower is suiBBciently dried when no moisture 
can be pressed from stem of flowers. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Instead of separating the cauliflower into its flowers, 
it can be cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. It is 
very interesting to see how the small wisp of dehydrated 
cauliflower rehydrates into its natural colored and sized 
floweret. Indeed, while this vegetable may darken 
considerably during the drying it restores beautifully. 
All leaves should be removed from the stems before 
drying. 



73 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Celery 

Select crisp, tender stalks. The white bleached 
celery becomes somewhat dark in drying, whereas the 
green seems to hold its color better. Separate leaves 
from stalks and dry each separately. Directions for 
drying celery leaves will be given under Spinach, on 
page 82. Cut away all discolored parts and cut cross- 
wise into half -inch length pieces. Place on trays an 
inch deep and steam-blanch for 3 minutes. Remove 
trays, shake to dry and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 

Celery is suflSciently dried if no moisture is apparent 
when pieces are pressed between fingers. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Corn 

The sweetest dehydrated product will be obtained 
from corn in the "milk" stage; that is, when a kernel 
of corn is pressed and the milk flows. Beyond this is 
the "dough" stage. Husk, place on trays and steam- 
blanch corn on the cob long enough to set the milk, 
— about 5 minutes. Drain and cut corn from the cob, 
cutting kernels about half through for one tray; then, 
using back of the knife, scrape the cobs (on another 
tray) to obtain the pulp. Treated in this way there is 

74 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

little danger of including the chaff from the cob. Place 
directly into dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time about 3 to 4 hours. 

When corn is hard it is ready to come from the dryer. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67. 



Kohl-rabi 

Use only such vegetables as are free from fibrous 
centers. Wash and peel thinly, cut into slices one- 
eighth of an inch in thickness, place on tray and steam- 
blanch for 3 minutes. Remove trays, shake a moment 
to drain and set tray in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 hours. 

Kohl-rabi is properly dried when no moisture can be 
pressed from a cut end. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 



Okra 

The very small pods may be dried whole, the larger 
pods being cut into slices one-fourth of an inch thick. 
Wash pods, cut or leave whole, place in single layer on 

75 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

tray and steam-blanch for 3 minutes. Remove tray, 
shake well to drain and place in the dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 135° F. 
Approximate time, when cut, about 3 hours. 

Product is sufficiently dried when no moisture can 
be pressed from the ends. When the pod is dried 
whole, break and press to determine if dried. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Onions 

Use vegetable of one color to give best dried product. 
Peel and cut across the onion into slices one-eighth 
inch thick. It is not necessary to steam-blanch onions, 
but place each tray into the dryer as soon as it is 
ready. Product should not be too thick on the trays 
to be evenly dried. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 

Onions are dried enough when no moisture can be 
pressed from a cut end. 

"Condition'* as directed on page 67. 

During drying this vegetable is apt to discolor, but 
rehydrates to a good color. 



76 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

Parsley and Other Herbs 

Wash to remove all dust, cut away any wilted or 
decayed parts, and dry without separating leaves and 
stems. Place on tray to a depth of 2 or 3 inches and 
set in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate time, 45 minutes to 1| hours. 

If no moisture can be pressed from thick part of 
stems the product is sufficiently dried. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

If desired, before packing, part of the product can 
be powdered and stored in glass jars. 

Parsnips 

This is one of the vegetables that should not be used 
if old, as it develops a woody, fibrous center. Wash, 
scrape and wash again, cut into slices one-eighth inch 
thick and place on tray. Blanch in steam for 3 min- 
utes, remove tray and shake to drain. Then place in 
thp dryer. 



Starting temperature, 110 F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 3 to 4 hours. 

Parsnips are sufficiently dry when no moisture can 
be pressed from a cut edge. 

"Condition** as directed on page 67. 

77 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Peas 

Select young and strictly fresh-picked peas, and on 
no account use any that have stood until pods are 
wilted. A quick way to shell the peas is to place the 
washed pods in a large saucepan of boiling water and 
leave for 6 minutes. Then drain on to the tray and 
rub the pods briskly over the tray with the hands to 
loosen the peas, and if the mesh is too fine for them to 
drop through, it is a simple matter to shake the peas 
to one end and empty them on to another tray. When 
one tray is loaded to a depth of about 1 inch, steam- 
blanch for 2 minutes, remove tray, shake to drain and 
set in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 3| to 4| hours. 

To test when dry cut open, and if no moisture shows 
in center remove from dryer. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 



Peppers 

The small pods may be dried whole like okra pods. 
Larger peppers should be placed on plates in the oven 
until the skins blister, then peel with the fingers. Cut 
large peppers into strips one-eighth of an inch wide, 
discarding all seeds, or they may be cut in halves, 

78 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

in which event remove the midribs. Place on trays and 
dry without blanching. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 

Finishing temperature, 140° F. 

Approximate time, about 3 hours or longer, depending 

upon how the product is prepared, — whether cut small 

or left whole. 

The whole and cut peppers are sufficiently dried 
when no moisture can be pressed from a cut edge. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Potatoes 

White Potato 

If a peeling machine is used, there will be less waste 
if potatoes of uniform size are used. While washing the 
vegetable, grade for size. Peel vegetable thinly and 
drop immediately into cold water to keep it white. 
When sufficient have been peeled to fill one tray, the 
potatoes should be sliced one-fourth of an inch thick 
directly onto the tray. Each tray can be loaded 1 inch 
deep. Place the filled tray in the steam container and 
blanch for 3 minutes; remove from steam, dip the tray 
into salted tepid water for a minute, drain by shaking 
and place in the dryer. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 
Finishing temperature, 160° F. 
Approximate time (according to age). 

79 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Potatoes are dried until they are brittle. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

If a variety is desired, cut some of the sliced potatoes 
into Julienne strips or larger strips (five-eighths of an 
inch thick), like French fried. Again, these vegetables 
can be steamed until cooked in their jackets, then the 
skins peeled off with the fingers and the cooked potatoes 
pressed through a ricer directly onto the trays. If 
you have no ricer put them tlirough your food chopper, 
loading each tray direct from the chopper. Spread 
evenly on the tray and place in the dryer. When 
dried mark the container holding this product "De- 
hydrated Mashed Potato." Directions for using this 
are found on page 153, in last part of recipe for Mashed 
Potatoes. 

Sweet Potato 

Select potatoes of uniform size and wash well with a 
brush. Place in a saucepan with boiling water and 
boil until slightly tender. Drain and peel at once by 
scraping the skins. Sweet potatoes can also be pared 
in a peeling machine. Cut the precooked potato into 
one-eighth inch thick slices directly onto the tray, 
loading it to a depth of 1 inch, then set tray in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 125° F. 
Finishing temperature, 155° F. 
Approximate time (according to age). 

The test for sweet potatoes is the same as for white 
ones. 

80 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Prepare some of the sweet potatoes by cooking in 
boiling water until nearly done, then remove skins and 
put through food chopper. Load tray evenly and place 
in dryer, using same temperature as above. When 
product is brittle it is dried. This is a "Dehydrated 
Mashed Sweet Potato," and is your sweet potato flour 
when ground. (See Sweet Potato Pie, on page 193.) 

Pumpkin 

Select a firm, deep-colored pumpkin and cut into 
strips 2 or 3 inches wide. Peel, remove seeds and 
soft, stringy centers, then cut into slices one-eighth 
of an inch thick. Place prepared pumpkin on trays to 
a depth of an inch, and place directly into the dryer 
without blanching. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 3| to 4 hours. 

Pumpkin is sufficiently dried when no moisture can 
be pressed from a cut edge. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Rhubarb 

The firm, prime stalks give best results. When 
very young do not skin, but if the rhubarb is old, then 
peel. Cut into pieces about a half inch long, cover the 
trays with one thickness of clean cheesecloth, then 

81 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

load trays with rhubarb an inch thick and steam-blanch 
for 1| minutes. Remove from steam, shake to drain 
and place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time (according to age). 

Cut a piece of dried rhubarb and press cut edge. If 
no moisture shows, it is sufficiently dried. 
*' Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Spinach and Similar Produce 

Look over the vegetable very carefully, removing all 
wilted, decayed leaves and foreign matter, and cutting 
off the roots. Have a dishpan filled with water as 
hot as for dish washing, put in the spinach and wash 
carefully. Lift out spinach, pour off water, rinse pan 
and return spinach. Add more hot water and rinse 
thoroughly, then lift out the vegetable and place on 
trays. While loading the trays cut off the stems and 
dry them on a separate tray. Load tray to a depth 
of several inches, shake to drain the product, then 
place in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 130° F. 
Approximate time, about It} to 2} hours. 

Spinach is dry when the thick part can be pressed 
without showing moisture, but be careful not to over- 
dry or the product breaks. 

82 



HOME DEHYDRATING, VEGETABLES 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

The stems of spinach are dried separately from the 
leaves, as they usually require longer time, and if they 
were left on, the leaves would probably be dried to a 
powder stage when the stems were ready. After drying 
and "conditioning" the leaves and stems separately 
they may be mixed and then packed. The spinach can 
also be cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. This will 
materially hasten the drying, reducing the time to 
about 1 hour. Celery leaves, Swiss chard and beet 
tops are treated the same as spinach. The heavy 
midrib of the chard is cut out and dried separately from 
the leaf. 

Squash 

I prefer a late squash to the summer variety. Cut 
into strips 2 inches wide, peel and remove soft centers 
and seeds. Cut into slices one-eighth inch thick. 
Place on trays and insert in the dryer without blanching . 



Starting temperature, 110 F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 31 hours. 

Drying is finished when no moisture can be pressed 
from a cut piece. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Tomatoes 

Select firm, sound tomatoes that are ripe. Remove 
skins by placing in a wire basket and scalding in boiling

DEHYDRATING: FOODS 

water for from 1 to 1| minutes, or until skins crack. 
When cool enough to handle pull off the skin and cut 
out core; also remove any blemishes. Cut crosswise 
into slices one-fourth of an inch thick. Cover trays 
with a piece of clean cheesecloth, then place slices in a 
single layer and insert trays in the dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 140° F. 
Approximate time, about 2 to 3 hours. 

When tomatoes are suflBciently dried no moisture 
can be pressed from fleshy part of the slice.

Soup Mixtures 

These consist of different kinds of dehydrated vege- 
tables rather finely cut and mixed in varying propor- 
tions according to the flavors desired. A good way to 
do is to use proportions as given in your favorite recipe. 

The vegetables usually combined in these mixtures 
are onions, carrots, turnips, cabbage, celery, parsley, 
potatoes and green pepper. Dry separately. 

For a vegetable soup the vegetables look daintier if 
cut in different shapes. For instance, potatoes and 
turnips can be cubed, carrots and peppers in Julienne 
strips, celery and onions sliced, cabbage shredded and 
parsley powdered. 

Try the following combinations, or arrange your own 
proportions : —

Mix thoroughly before packing. This gives 5 cups 
of dehydrated vegetables, which is sufficient to flavor 
from 20 to 24 quarts of liquid. From this you can 
readily see how far the soup mixture goes. It is in a 
most convenient form, and is a decided addition to 
many dishes, especially those of the pot-roast style. 
Have all soup vegetables finely cut, as this gives best 
flavoring.

VEGETABLE FLOURS AND MEALS 

Under this heading may be found — 

Pea meal or flour. 
Bean meal or flour. 
White potato meal or flour. 
Sweet potato meal or flour. 
Pumpkin meal or flour. 
Squash meal or flour. 
Tomato meal or flour. 
Corn meal or flour. 
Spinach meal or flour. 

Potato Flours 

A very excellent grade of home-made potato flour is 
prepared as follows : — 

Make sure that both the sweet and white potatoes 
are dehydrated until they are brittle. After ** con- 
ditioning" run these products separately through your 
food chopper, using a medium-coarse knife, then change 
to the finest knife and run it through twice. This 
produces a fine product. Shake through several sifters, 
starting with the coarser mesh and finishing with a 
fine one. Your finely sifted home-made potato flour 
is ready to be made up into various recipes, such as 
combining with corn meal or wheat flour into muflBns, 

86 



VEGETABLE FLOURS AND MEALS 

biscuits, griddle cakes, waffles or breads, and even into 
a good pastry if used in proportion of about one-eighth 
potato flour to balance of wheat flour. 

The first sifting of the flour was coarse, and this can 
be kept to use in potato croquettes, soups or for thick- 
ening sauces, etc. 

The sweet potato flour is all ready to have the 
custard addition, then turned into a pastry lined pie 
tin as a Sweet Potato Pie; see page 193. 

Pumpkin Flour 

This is prepared by drying the pumpkin until it is 
brittle, then "conditioning," putting through the food 
chopper, and sifting as is done with potato flour. When 
so prepared it is no trouble to make pumpkin pie, 
timbales or any other dish in which mashed pumpkin 
is the foundation. In fact, with a supply of dehydrated 
vegetables made into flour or meal in your kitchen 
pantry it is far easier to make many dishes than when 
one must start with the preparation of the raw vegeta- 
ble. 

These two recipes are given simply as a guide to 
direct you so that you can make any one or all of the 
meals in the list. The main point to remember is that 
any dehydrated vegetable that is to be ground up into 
meal must first be dried until it is brittle, or it cannot 
be put through either your food chopper or your hand- 
flour mill and give a satisfactory product.

CHAPTER IX 

HOME DEHYDRATING 
(FRUITS) 

Both the large and small fruits can and should be 
dehydrated. Many of the directions given for vegeta- 
bles are applicable to fruits. 

Only firm, ripe fruits should be used if their original 
shape and color are to be retained in both the dried 
form and when rehydrated. 

Naturally, after the fruit has been cooked, it will be 
changed in shape, and frequently the color will be 
somewhat different, in many cases this being accentu- 
ated after the addition of the sugar. 

To wash the tender small fruits such as berries, 
place them in a shallow flat strainer and hold them 
under the cold-water faucet. Let the water run gently 
on them. This can readily be done if the hand is held 
under the faucet so that the water first strikes the 
hand, and then trickles off on to the fruits. Be careful 
that the berries are not crushed or broken, as that 
means a loss of juice, which naturally would impair 
both color and flavor. 

After washing, the berries are drained and gently 
rolled out of the strainer on to the trays, which should 
be covered with a thickness of clean cheesecloth. This 
is done to prevent the fruit from coming in contact with 
the metal trays, as the acid would cause chemical action. 

While the berries are being placed on the trays any 

88 



HOME DEHYDRATING, FRUITS 

wilted, unripe ones can be removed; also leaves or any 
foreign matter. 

Fruit should be promptly placed in the dryer after its 
preparation. Be very careful not to load the trays 
more than two layers deep. Berries are very tender 
fruit, and if loaded deeper they will be crushed out of 
shape. During drying examine the trays, and if fruits 
are lumping and sticking together, separate carefully 
so that the drying is done evenly. 

The test for drying is by pressing a cut edge, and if no 
moisture exudes the product is sufficiently dried. 

After drying the "conditioning" period must be 
observed, as with vegetables. When this is finished 
the fruits are stored in similar containers, and should 
preferably be kept in the dark so that they will not be 
faded by the light. 

Apples 

Select firm, sound fruit. Remove cores with a coring 
machine or knife, if apple is to be cut into rings, and 
pare quickly. As soon as peeled cut into slices one- 
fourth inch thick and place on trays about 1 inch 
thick. As soon as a tray is ready it should go immedi- 
ately into the dryer and other trays loaded as quickly 
as the apples are pared. The quicker this is done the 
better the product, as there will be less danger of oxidiz- 
ing or discoloration. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 
Finishing temperature, 160° F. 
Approximate time for drying, 5 to 6 hours. 

89 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Length of time depends upon the kind of apple, as 
well as thickness of slices. Apples are sufficiently dried 
when a cut edge is pressed and no moisture is noticed. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Apricots 

Use firm fruit, but well-ripened. Reject all soft 
apricots and cut away any bruises. Cut in halves 
without peeling, remove stone and lay in single layer 
on trays with cut side up. As soon as loaded place 
trays in the dryer. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 
Finishing temperature, 150° F. 
Approximate time for drying, 5 to 7 hours. 

Apricots are dried when no moisture can be pressed 
from a cut edge. 

"Condition " as directed on page 67. 

Bananas 

Select firm, ripe, yellow bananas. Remove skins 
and cut lengthwise into quarters, or crosswise into 
slices one-eighth inch thick. Place in single layer on 
trays, dust very lightly with powdered sugar, shaking off 
all surplus, and set trays in the dryer. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 135° F. 

Do not have heat any higher or the fruit will soften. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67.

HOME DEHYDRATING, FRUITS 

Blackberries 

Select such fruit as you would for table use. Look 
over, rejecting decayed and wilted berries, and wash if 
necessary. This can be done as follows: place berries 
in a shallow wire basket, hold the hand under cold 
water faucet, and let water trickle on fruit through the 
fingers. Drain and place berries in single layers on 
trays lined with one thickness of cheesecloth. As 
quickly as loaded set trays in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 
Finishing temperature, 150° F. 
Approximate time for drying, 5 to 7 hours. 

Berries are dried when no moisture can be pressed 
when berries are cut. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Cherries 

Perfectly sound fruit should be selected and all of one 
color kept together. Look over before pitting, remov- 
ing all decayed and crushed cherries. Both the sweet 
and sour cherries may be dried. There is less loss of 
juice if fruit is dried whole, with pit left in. Where 
cherries are large they may be pitted with a machine, 
the juice saved and sterilized. Some cut the fruit in 
halves. If this method is followed the cut side should 
be placed uppermost on the dryer to prevent further 
loss of juice. As soon as prepared load cheesecloth 

91 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

covered trays two layers deep and place at once in the 
dryer. 

Starting temperature, 115° F. 

Finishing temperature, 145° F. 

Approximate drying time for cut fruit, 4 to 5 hours. 

Cherries are dry if no moisture shows when a cut 
edge is pressed. 

''Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Cranberries 

If this fruit is dehydrated it is available at any time 
of the year. Examine and remove all decayed and 
broken-down fruits; likewise unripe berries. Cut in 
halves and place on cheesecloth-covered trays to a 
depth of a half inch, and set in dryer. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 
Finishing temperature, 145° F. 
Approximate drying time, 2 to 3^ hours. 

Berries are dry when no moisture can be pressed from 
a cut edge. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

After product is dried stems can be readily removed. 

Currants 

The cherry currant gives the better dried product. 
Remove soft and decayed fruit, but do not stem, as 
this can be done after drying. Load cheesecloth-

covered trays to a depth of an inch and place in 
dryer. 

Starting temperature, 120° F. 

Finishing temperature, 145° F. 

Approximate drying time, 3 to 5 hours. 

Currants are dried when no moisture can be pressed 
from a cut edge. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Peaches 

The yellow fleshed peaches give a richer looking 
finished product than do the white fruit. These may be 
peeled or not. A quick way to peel is to place peaches 
in wire basket and immerse in boiling water for a 
minute until skins crack. Remove from water, drain 
and pull skins off with the fingers. Cut fruit in halves, 
remove stones and place on cheesecloth-covered tray 
with cavity side up, loading trays one layer deep, and 
place each tray in dryer as soon as it is ready. Work 
quickly so that the fruit does not darken by being ex- 
posed to the air. 



Starting temperature, 120 F. 
Finishing temperature, 150° F. 
Approximate drying time, 5 to 7 hours. 

Peaches are dried when the product is leathery. 
Press a cut edge to determine if there is any moisture. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67. 
Peaches may be cut in quarters if desired, or sliced. 

93 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Pears 

These should be perfectly ripe but of firm texture. 
Pare, cut in halves or quarters, remove cores and place 
on cheesecloth-covered trays with cavity side up. As 
soon as a tray is loaded it should go into the dryer. 
There should be no undue delay in the preparation of 
fruits for the dryer, and this is especially true of the 
kinds that tarnish quickly when their pared and cut 
surfaces are exposed to the air. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 150° F. 
Approximate drying time, 6 hours. 

When dried there will be no moisture when cut edge 
is pressed, and the product will be leathery. 
"Condition" as directed on page 67. 

Plums 

Thoroughly ripened fruit should be selected in which 
the sugar is well developed. Cut in halves, removing 
stems and pits, load on cheesecloth-covered trays with 
cavity side up, and to a depth of one layer only. Place 
in dryer as soon as each tray is ready. 

Starting temperature, 110° F. 
Finishing temperature, 150° F. 
Approximate drying time, 5 to 6 hours. 

When dried there should be no moisture when a cut 
edge is pressed. Product should be like peaches, — 
somewhat leathery. 

"Condition" as directed on page 67.

CHAPTER X 

COOKING DIRECTIONS 

In restoring the dehydrated products you will notice 
that some take more time to rehydrate, or bring back, 
just as some require more time to dry than others do. 

Where long soaking is necessary, say 8 or more hours, 
it is convenient to put the product to soak over night. 

It is advisable to soak the food in a deep bowl, with 
the amount of water needed, and turn into the sauce- 
pan when ready for cooking. 

Do not have heat too strong at first, but bring gradu- 
ally to boiling point, and then boil gently (a little more 
than simmering) until tender. 

The water in which vegetables are soaked and cooked 
should be used as part of the liquid in the sauce (see 
recipe for Vegetable Sauce, page 109) when the vegeta- 
ble is served with one. The liquid may also be used in 
soups, thus obtaining flavor and utilizing the mineral 
salts that were dissolved during the boiling of the 
vegetable. 

Vegetables may be soaked in tepid water instead of 
cold, which will hasten their restoration. 

If dehydrated foods are being soaked in hot weather, 
they should be placed in the refrigerator or other cold 
place. Then cook as soon as the product has been re- 
stored. 

95 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

Where dehydrated products are to be used for flavor- 
ing, break or cut into small pieces before soaking. 

Fruits as well as vegetables should be cooked in the 
same water in which they are soaked. Bring very 
slowly to boiling point and simmer for 15 minutes, then 
drain, add sugar to liquid, reheat until boiling, add fruit 
and simmer until tender. Best results are always 
obtained by very slow cooking. A fireless cooker serves 
excellently for this purpose. 

Regarding length of time necessary to rehydrate the 
dried product, this depends largely upon how the ma- 
terial was treated before dehydrating. A vegetable 
that was cooked until tender, then dehydrated, will 
restore quicker when soaked, and will cook in a very 
short time. 

Furthermore, after the food is dehydrated, if it is 
ground into a powdered form, little time will be re- 
quired for cooking, and no previous soaking is neces- 
sary. 

If your dehydrated products are cut in different ways, 
such as sliced, diced or into strips, select the style of 
product best suited to the recipe. As an example, sliced 
potatoes would be your choice for escalloped potatoes. 

The thoughtful and careful housekeeper who plans 
her meal in advance will find that dehydrated products 
are very easy to serve. The foods that require long 
rehydrating may be soaked over night for a midday 
meal, putting them to soak as late in the evening as is 
convenient. And for the evening dinner, start soaking 
dehydrated products early in the morning. 

96 



COOKING DIRECTIONS 

Suppose, in looking over the recipes included here- 
with, that a housekeeper plans her meals ahead for a 
week. The recipes given, generally speaking, are 
sufficient to serve four people. With this in mind any 
one can cut the proportions in half or double them, 
according to requirements. Or if one wishes to cook 
enough of any one kind of the dehydrated product for 
a second meal, follow the Preliminary Directions, and 
the food is then ready to be served in any way desired. 
There are also a number of recipes for dishes that 
are really a meal in themselves, and, with the addition 
of bread and butter, a salad dessert or fruit, nothing 
more is required. Any one of the following will furnish 
a most delicious meal and one requiring but little 
work : — 

Savory Meat Stretching Dish (page 114). 

One-dish Meal (page 115). 

Corn Chowder (page 137). 

Pot Roast and Vegetables (page 116). 

Vegetable Stew (page 117). 

Measurements for Cooking Dehydrated 
Vegetables 

The cup specified in the recipes is the cook's half- 
pint measuring cup, and when dehydrated products 
are used the cup is measured heaping full. 

A tablespoon or teaspoon means all that the spoon 
will hold. 

The above refer to dehydrated vegetables that are 
cut into dices, slices or Julienne strips. 

97 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

When the product is finely cut before dehydrating, 
more can be put into the cup than when the pieces are 
larger. In this event use level measure; also when the 
dehydrated product is powdered, use level measure. 

Unless otherwise stated, all other ingredients are 
measured level.

meat and rinse out the pan in which it was browned 
with a very little hot water and add to soup pot. Let 
this simmer for an hour, then gradually bring the 
soaked vegetables and water to a boil, add to meat 
stock, also "bouquet," and salt to taste; simmer for 
several hours. Strain through colander, and when 
liquid is cold remove all fat. May be served as clear 
soup, or, if desired, add a quarter cup of Soup Vegeta- 
ble Mixture which has been soaked for a half hour in 
the stock; then cook gently until vegetables are tender, 
— usually about 20 minutes, as vegetables are finely 
cut.

Vegetable Soup 

2 Quarts soup stock. 

^ Cup dehydrated soup mixture. (See page 85.) 

Soak vegetables in stock for 10 minutes, then bring 
slowly to boiling point and simmer until vegetables are 
tender. Instead of using soup stock, cold water and 
bouillon cubes may be used. Soak and cook vegetables 
in water until tender, dissolve cubes in a cup of the boil- 
ing liquid, add to vegetables, bring to boiling point and 
serve. In this way a vegetable soup may be quickly 
prepared, requiring about a half hour. 

Many other soups may be made from the dehydrated 
products by using the recipes given here as a basis for 
other soups. To save time, put the dehydrated product 
through a food chopper, or if the product is dried until 
brittle it can be ground into coarse meal through the 
hand-flour mills. In this event soaking is not neces- 
sary.

CHAPTER XV 

RECIPES FOR USING DEHYDRATED FRUITS 

The measurement for these products is "heaping" 
unless given by weight or otherwise stated. 

The fruits are generally soaked in cold water and 
slowly cooked until partly done in the same water. 
Then drain, add sugar to juice, let this boil for several 
minutes, then add the partly cooked fruit and continue 
simmering until tender. The slower dehydrated fruits 
are cooked the richer and better looking will be the 
finished product. 

A very slow oven or a fireless cooker prepares these 
foods the best. All of the larger fruits, such as de- 
hydrated prunes, pears, apricots, peaches and plums, 
are delicious when cooked in the oven in a bean pot or 
casserole. 

Time required to rehydrate fruits depends upon the 
condition and kind of product. While approximate 
time is given in the recipes, however, each cook must 
use her own judgment, and from personal experience 
determine the length of time the special kinds require. 

I have used a dehydrated banana that required no 
soaking, as it was found to be sufficiently tender when 
prepared as the recipe stated. Again I have seen the 
same fruit when dehydrated by others to be quite hard, 
thus needing some time to rehydrate.

Canning and Preserving Dehydrated Products 

Perhaps our summer has been spent in dehydrating 
our supply of fruits, and winter finds no shelves of 
canned fruits, sparkling jellies, delicious jams, marma- 
lades and all the other good things that we have become 
accustomed to. 

But with our stock of dehydrated fruits we may have 
some of them canned, make conserves, jams, marma- 
lades of others, yes, and jellies and pickles too. And 
best of all, both our dehydrating and, later on, our 
canning may be done in comfort, for dehydrating is 
carried on at a low temperature; consequently, the 

194 



DEHYDRATED FRUIT RECIPES 

kitchen is not overheated, and in winter, when our 
dehydrated product may become a canned one, we 
are very glad of the extra heat. 

Whoever spent a really comfortable day canning 
and making all the other goodies in hot summer 
weather? Standing over the fire carefully stirring the 
kettle of jam can be comfortably done, however, when 
the snow is on the ground, and not when old Sol is 
doing his utmost to make the work a martyrdom. So 
do not think that because your fruits are in a de- 
hydrated stage you are barred from enjoying them as 
of yore. No, indeed; the dried product gives an 
excellent canned or jellied one, and this is equally true 
of the other forms of preserves, such as jams and 
conserves. 



195 



ADDENDA 
Practical Suggestions 

Dehydrated products do not restore satisfactorily until 
they have been out of the dehydrator for 24 hours. This 
is probably because the cells are tired and need a little rest 
and recuperation, for even "inanimate" matter becomes 
exhausted. 

Be careful not to under-dry, for if free moisture is left in, 
molding is apt to ensue. 

Approximate time-tables have been given, but, as ex- 
plained with them, the times indicated are approximative 
only, or, in plainer term, elastic. Climate, soil, season, al- 
titude, thickness of slices or pieces, water content, age of 
produce are all factors requiring consideration, but with a 
little practice one is soon able to tell by the "feel" whether 
dehydration is completed or not, and the test suggested 
previously for free moisture is a safe guide always. Generally 
speaking, products should be leathery and just past the free 
moisture stage. If dried in machine to crisp or brittle stage, 
restoration and quality are doubtful. Most products will 
harden during the conditioning period, which is as it should 
be. 

If a batch of fruits or vegetables should prove insufficiently 
dehydrated after removal from dryer, replace until really 
finished — in low temperature at first, and when material 
is well warmed through raise the temperature to maximum 
for that particular product. 

Dehydrate in dry weather if possible. This applies to 
packing awaj' also. 

196 



ADDENDA 

Dehydrators, large or small, should be thoroughly cleaned 
and sterilized at frequent intervals. 

Produce must be cubed, sliced or stripped uniformly, other- 
wise part of the dehydrator's contents will be ready to come 
out before the rest is done, resulting, perhaps, in both under 
and over drying. 

Moist air is always best in the dehydrator during the first 
quarter or third of the process. 

It is best to cut glutinous material into thin slices or fine 
strips — bell peppers and okra, for example. While such 
things may be dehydrated whole or in large sections, it takes 
very much more time. As a matter of fact, the finer all 
materials are cut, the greater will be the saving of time, fuel 
and attention. Output will be increased also, as the de- 
hydrator can be filled and emptied more frequently. 

With a view to the appearance of finished product, two 
agents are employed by some operators to prevent discolora- 
tion, namely, sulphur and carbonic acid gas. The latter was 
in vogue many years ago, having been employed in the old- 
style drum dryers, coke being the source usually. 

Drying times for potatoes vary greatly according to age 
of vegetable. 

When piling trays, allow for circulation of air and libera- 
tion of moisture. Slices should not lie closely on top of each 
other. 

Stems must be removed from leaves of spinach and the 
like before drying, but can be mixed later, after separate 
drying. With cabbage, the thick midrib should be cut from 
leaf and sliced before drying. 

Flavoring herbs, mint, etc., should not be blanched, as 
thereby they lose much of their volatile properties. 

Restoring and cooking are very important considerations. 
Do not drown products by using too much water for restora- 

197 



DEHYDRATING FOODS 

tion, but see that there is sufficient for full absorption, and 
a little more. Cook the products in the same water in which 
they were restored, as directed in recipe section. 

In dehydrating large quantities there will necessarily be 
a good deal of broken pieces and scraps. These may be dried 
and mixed for soup stock. 

Before attempting to market various runs, test samples 
for restoration and other qualities. 

Be careful to keep containers insect-proof. Bags and 
packages must have no holes, and must be kept securely 
sealed. It is well to coat with paraffin after sealing. If 
glass jars and crocks are used, they must be tightly covered. 

As volatiles and other essentials are retained through 
dehydration, this process may become an important factor 
in the manufacturing of perfumes. Tests are being made 
now, in my experimental kitchen, with flower petals and 
other materials, to determine whether they can be dehy- 
drated and used later for perfume making, when and as 
convenient. 

Fruit juices are being dehydrated and used in powder 
form for flavorings. 

Vegetable Colorings. — Pure vegetable colorings are made 
by grinding spinach, beets, carrots, etc., to powder after 
dehydration.
