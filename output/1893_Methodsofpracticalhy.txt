SECTION VI. 
MEAT. 1 

236. A right supervision of the nutrition of mankind 
with meat in the most extended sense of the term is prac- 
ticable only if there is performed a twofold investigation. 
On the one hand, the health of the living beast must be 
pronounced on by the veterinary surgeon ; and on the other, 
after slaughter, the flesh, and especially the intestines, of the 
animal must be examined by an expert. In consequence of 
the eminent importance of a correct decision upon meat, the 
necessary knowledge should become also the common pro- 
perty of medical men. 

An inspection of the flesh of game and poultry has been 
hitherto almost universally deficient. At most its freshness 
is tested. 

A. Examination of Meat. 

237. In the examination of meat it is not sufficient to 
say whether a sample in question is injurious to health or 
not, as in many cases meat, without being strictly hurtful, 
may evince properties or changes which make it disgusting, 2 
and hence unfit for public consumption. Though we must, 
as far as possible, distinguish between what is loathsome and 
what is unwholesome, an absolute line cannot be drawn, as 
in sensitive persons the consumption of a disgusting sub- 
stance may be directly injurious to health. 

For a correct decision we must take up the following 
questions : 

1 By " meat " we understand in these pages the entire recent animal nutri- 
ment, therefore including the edible viscera. 

2 A rigid, universally valid definition of "disgusting" cannot be given. 
Disgust is excited among individuals with very different readiness, and a 
substance is often consumed in ignorance with the best appetite, though it 
would have been rejected with loathing if particulars about it had been known.

J. THE EXAMINATION OF MEAT FOR ITS PROPORTION 
OF NUTRIENT MATTER. 

21)8. The chemical examination of meat for its chief 
components (water, albumenoids, fat, ash) is scarcely per- 
formed for hygienic purposes, as sufficient analyses are 
available, and as frauds and dangers to health cannot thus 
be detected. If necessary, it is performed according to the 
general methods laid down in 209. 

The composition of muscular tissue fluctuates greatly, according to 
its proportion of fat. (See Table IX.) Fat meat is always absolutely 
poor in water ; the proportion of albumenoids in fat meat is generally 
somewhat, and sometimes considerably, smaller than in lean meat. 



EXAMINATION FOR NUTRIENT MATTER. 3 

The difference between meat as tough or tender, dry or juicy, savoury 
or insipid, cannot as yet be sufficiently explained chemically. 

It is estimated that an ox contains from 40 to 48 per cent, of muscular 
flesh, 11 per cent, of bones, and 1 1 to 25 per cent, of fat. According to 
Friedel, meat, as bought of the butcher, contains as an average 83 per 
cent, of muscular flesh, 8 '4 per cent, of bones, 8 '6 per cent, of fat. 

As among us there is no kind of animal known the flesh 
of which is per se injurious, the detection of the substitution 
of one kind of meat for another is of hygienic importance 
only in as far as the flesh of horses, dogs, and cats in our 
districts seems more or less disgusting to most persons. 
Berlin consumes yearly 8000 horses. 

The distinction between the various kinds of meat is easy 
for the veterinary surgeon trained in comparative anatomy, 
in so far as the bones, the tongue, and certain viscera support 
the diagnosis (see Zeitschrift fur Fleiscli- und Milch-hygiene, 
1891, No. 10), but it is often very difficult if separate pieces 
of meat have to be pronounced upon. Horse-flesh and 
beef are certainly deep red, the former frequently with a 
brownish cast ; mutton is red or dark- red, pork and veal are 
of a pale colour. The odour is somewhat different (especially 
on the application of heat), but it is not easy to found a 
certain opinion upon it. 

The fat is better available for a diagnosis ; that of the 
horse is yellow and soft, that of the ox is harder and yellow 
only in old animals; mutton may be recognised by hard 
white fat, and pork by soft white fat. 

On chemical analysis the different melting-points of the fat ( 312) 
give a clue to the origin of the meat, but the fats from different parts 
of the body of one and the same animal are so unequally fusible that 
this criterion may often fail. In. one and the same ox E. Schulze and 
A. Reiiiecke (Konig, p. 199) found the melting-point of the kidney fat 
50, but that of the fat of the muscles 41 to 42. In a sheep fluctua- 
tions of 52 to 41 have been observed, and in a pig from 48 to 42 -5. 
Horse-fat melts at 32 to 3 7 '2. Every author gives statements which 
are rather discrepant. 

Niebel ( Ueber den Nachweis des Pferdefteisches in Nalirungs- 
mitteln, Berlin, 1891) has recently shown in a very interest- 
ing investigation the high proportion of glycogen and sugar 
in horse-flesh, and applied the determination of these sub- 



4 MEAT. 

stances to the diagnosis of beef and horse-flesh. The de- 
termination of glycogen is unfortunately so elaborate an 
operation, that the method (according to Brucke and Keilz) 
cannot be here given in detail. The results seem very well 
adapted for a certain decision in disputed cases. 100 grm. 
of the dry substance, free from fat, contained : 



Glycogen. Glucose. 

Horse .... 1-5-47 0*8-4 '9 3-8-6-2 

Ox ..... 0-0-8 0-2-1-0 0-3-1-0 

Long keeping, smoking, pickling or roasting destroy the 
glycogen but slightly ; young, well-fed horses contain more 
glycogen than such as are old and worn-out. Even in 
sausage this method gives certain results if the quantity of 
horse-flesh added is not too small. 

II. EXAMINATION WHETHER MEAT IS FRESH. 

239. The living muscle has a faint alkaline reaction ; 
lactic acid is formed in abundance in the muscles of the 
slaughtered animal. On long preservation this acid has a 
relaxing action upon the meat. Meat which has been hang- 
ing or lying for some time offers much less resistance to our 
teeth than such as has been freshly killed. 

As long as meat has an acid reaction there exists no 
decided putridity. ."We may therefore regard the test with 
litmus paper as an important method of ascertaining the 
freshness of meat. As soon as an alkaline reaction sets in 
ammonia and substituted ammonias being formed by the 
activity of schizomycetes putrefaction has already reached 
an advanced stage. 

The smell and taste are altered in a well-known manner. 
The sense of smell gives the earliest and most trustworthy 
indication of incipient decomposition. 

Eber (Archiv /. Wiss und Pract. Tkierheilkunde, xvii., 
1891) recommends the formation of ammonia by putrefac- 
tion to be observed by the approach of a glass rod moistened 
with hydrochloric acid (cloud of sal-ammoniac). As strong 
hydrochloric acid gives off fumes in the air, he pours into a 



EXAMINATION WHETHER MEAT IS FRESH. 5 

small glass cylinder a few cubic centimetres of a mixture of 
1 part hydrochloric acid and 3 parts alcohol + 1 part ether. 
The glass is stoppered and shaken, so that its sides are 
moistened. A fragment of the meat stuck upon a wire is 
then introduced without touching the sides of the cylinder. 
A cloud appears only if NH 3 is present. 

The colour of fresh meat is light reddish-grey to dark 
brownish-red ; if decomposing it changes to a greenish-grey 
or greenish-violet. The change of colour is to be seen first 
on the specular part of the sinews. The consistence of fresh 
meat is firm ; on commencing putrefaction it becomes some- 
what soft; the surface often shows smeary deposits of 
bacteria. 

Kraus has made an especial study of the species occurring 
on the outside of meat. He found fifty-one species, none of 
them pathogenic, but one species very similar to Bac. coli 
communis and to Gaertner's Bac. enter idis (Zeit. /. Fleisch- 
und Milch-hygiene, 1890-91, part 5). 

According to Gaertner, meat three days old contains bacteria only in 
the outer margin zone ; meat ten days old and quite putrid to the 
depths of 1 centimetre is quite permeated by bacteria ; the blood-vessels 
are, however, free from microbia if the meat has been obtained from 
a healthy animal. The examination must take place on dyed micro- 
tome sections. Occasionally also plate-cultures with exactly known 
quantities of an infusion of finely ground meat are useful, enumerating 
the colonies. 

In venison epicures accept a degree of putrefaction (hav.t goM) which 
hygiene cannot approve. I cannot lay down a limit of toleration. 

Occasionally there occurs luminous meat, fishes, &c. 
With us this light is produced chiefly by the greenish phos- 
phorescent Bacterium phosphorescens (Fischer), which spreads 
over the meat (see 84). Very dilute plates on gelatine 
containing 3 per cent, of common salt yield a pure culture. 
Plate-culture is rendered difficult by the circumstance that 
Bacillus fluorescens putidus is antagonistic and interferes with 
the growth of Bacillus phosphorescens, and numberless septic 
germs are always present upon meat or fish along with the 
luminous bacilli. (See also Beyrinck, CcntralUaU f. Bakteri- 
logic, vii, p. 338.) 



6 MEAT. 

III. EXAMINATION WHETHER MEAT HAS BEEN OB- 
TAINED FROM A SOUND OR A DISEASED ANIMAL. 

240. If in this research we restrict ourselves to a scrutiny 
of the muscular flesh by means of the unaided senses, it will 
often prove impossible to detect the flesh of unhealthy ani- 
mals, much more to diagnose the disease. Hydatids and 
cretified trichinae are certainly detected by an experienced 
observer, and meat infiltrated by water, traversed by extra- 
vasated blood, having the colour of gall or a blackish-red 
(from imperfect bleeding) will be recognised. But we can- 
not ascertain much more. 

For a decisive judgment in difficult cases we absolutely 
require to know the condition of the skin and the intestines, 
or rather a skilful examination of the entire slaughtered 
animal, followed up by a microscopic or bacteriological in- 
vestigation according to the methods given in 39, &c. In 
many cases the inoculation of experimental animals with 
particles of the flesh supplies additional data. 

The diagnosis of all the different diseases of animals can 
of course not be here explained. In as far as they are 
infectious they are closely analogous to human diseases. 
Here will be merely given a review of the most important 
diseases occasioned by animal and vegetable parasites, since 
these possess almost exclusively a prominent importance 
from the hygienic point of view. 

A. Animal Parasites. 

241. The majority of the animal parasites hitherto known 
are of considerable size, whence their examination involves 
no especial difficulty, always supposing that the parasite does 
not occur too sporadically. 

1. TRICHINA. 

An experienced eye can recognise trichina? especially 
when cretified with the lens, though this procedure is 
always uncertain, and a microscopic examination should not 
be neglected. For inspection we cut at least 6 to 8 sec- 



ANIMAL PAEASITES. 



tions of 1 cm. in length from the meat in question, using a 
curved pair of scissors. These sections are cut in the direc- 
tion of the fibres, selecting as far as possible the vicinity of 
the parts where the muscles are attached to the bone, and 
pushing the place to be cut gently forwards. 

If the entire carcase is available the trichinae are sought 
for at their favourite stations : the muscles of the diaphragm, 
the belly, the neck, the eyes, the root of the tongue, the 
larynx, and in the intercostal muscles. Chatin has recently 
found trichinae both free and capsulated in the adipose tissue, 
which disagrees with earlier experience. 

The sections of meat are then laid side by side upon a 
port-object, covered with another port-object, and pressed 
together so as to obtain thin, translucent preparations. The 
sections must be so thin that on slight pressure they become 
J cm. in breadth. The examination is effected with a 
magnifying power of 30 to 80 dia- 
meters, though a rapid preliminary 
view is best taken with 20 to 30 
diameters. 

The image presented by trichinae 
in a muscle is different according 
to the length of time which has 
passed since the invasion of the 
trichinae. 

When the embryo trichinae are 
born in the bowel they are only 
from O'l to 0*15 mm. in length ; 
soon after birth they perforate the 1W1||1| IHH I 1 ^'Ill- 
coats of the bowel 1 and migrate |ji 
into the muscles of the body ; quite 
young muscle trichinae may have Fm.89.-You ng Muscle Trichi-

a length of 0'3 to 04 mm. After 

they have penetrated into a muscular fibrilla, the worms 
which were previously straight grow in about fourteen days 
to the length of from 0'6 to 1 mm. and the breadth of

drops 



0'05 mm., whilst the body is curved spirally. By degrees, 
in the course of some weeks, there is formed hy the re- 
active growth of the interfibrillar connective tissue a 
capsule of about 0*4 mm. in length, oval in form, but 
subsequently of the shape of a lemon, around the worms, 
which are now completely at rest. After some months 
of fat appear at the poles of the capsule in 
which there gradually appears a continu- 
ally increasing deposit of lime. If after 
about 1| year the capsule conceals the 
form of the trichina the latter can be 
made visible by adding a drop of acetic acid, 
when the lime is dissolved with an escape 
of carbonic acid. If, as it often happens, 
the trichinae are dead and decayed, the 
stout homogeneous capsule after removal 
of the lime admits of an accurate diagnosis. 

When weak, stale vinegar has been used to re- 
move the lime it has happened that the so-called 
" vinegar eels " (from 1 to 2'5 mm. in length) have

occasioned errors. But trichinae are never so ireely 

mobile and are otherwise very different on close scrutiny. 




' 90 ; 

Muscul 



Iii order to decide whether the meat in question contains 
living or dead trichinae, we require to observe distinct move- 
ments. Even within the capsules in a warm room distinct 
movements of the anterior extremity are observed in recent 
trichinae, and become more lively if we seek to open up the 
capsules with preparing needles and heat the port-object 
slightly (to above 40) ; the application of an acid stimulates 
the creatures to rapid but transient movements. 

If a certain decision cannot be arrived at in this manner 
rats and rabbits are fed on the suspected meat. After the 
lapse of three weeks, if the parasites are living, the muscles 
are found pervaded by young trichinae. 

In general trichinae often die spontaneously in the course of years, 
but cases have been published where they have remained living for 7, 
8, 10], 11], 13, and, on one occasion, 24 years. See Dammaim. 



ANIMAL PARASITES. 9 

(Deutsche Zeitschrift f. T/tiermediz, iii. 92). According to Gerlach they 
perish at a temperature of 56, which in the interior of large pieces of 
meat is attained only after prolonged roasting. 1 According to Fiedler 
a heat of 62 to 69 is required to kill trichinae. According to Leuckart 
they are little injured by free/ing ; three days' exposure to - 25 left 
muscular trichinae uninjured. 

On salting they perish quickly only in the superficial layers ; at the 
depth of from 2 to 3 cm. only after some weeks ; they were still alive 
in the interior of a ham which had been salted two months previously. 
In putrid meat they survive for weeks. 

Smoking and drying greatly injure trichinae. In well-smoked hams 
they are usually dead, as in the majority of American hams in which 
trichinae have been found remarkably often. Latterly the proportion 
of trichinae has been reduced in consequence of stricter regulations. In 
Prussia about one pig in 1800 or 2000 is trichinised. 

Besides in pork, trichinae have been found in the flesh of 
rats (from 6 to 8 per cent, of all rats are said to be trichinised), 
more rarely in mice and hamsters, occasionally in beasts of 
prey cat, dog, fox, badger, bear. According to Johne the 
examination of sausages for trichinae can be carried out with 
some degree of accuracy only if at least three to four thin 
sections per kilo are cut out of the sausage at different places. 
Harpooning out morsels from the sausage is, in his opinion, 
quite insufficient. Consequently a rational search for trichinae 
is practicable only before the mass has been stuffed into 
the skins. 

242. Occasionally there occur parasitic worms which 
have an approximate similarity to trichinae ; the character- 
istics of the latter are : 

1. The shining, non-striated, lemon-shaped capsule. 

2. A thin anterior and a thicker, rounded, posterior end 
of the body. The oesophagus, except at the head extremity, 
is surrounded as far as the middle of the worm with a thick

coating of large cells (the " cellular body "), which is almost 
entirely wanting in other worms which might have come in 
question. 

3. The residence in the muscles. 

A series of larval forms of worms of the families of Ascarides, Stron- 
gylides, and Filariae occasionally occur in capsules which have a remote 
resemblance to the capsules of the trichinae, but they are found much 
more frequently in the viscera than in the muscles (the latter in fishes, 
moles, and mice). In all the characteristic cellular body is wanting, 
and they possess a conically pointed tail. The Ascarides 
have also a boring-tooth at the head-end. 

The young form of Trichocephalus dispar, a cylindrical 
worm common in the bowels of man. and of the domestic 
animals, greatly resembles a trichina, but it has a cellular 
body, which extends to the posterior third part of the 
worm : in its trichina-like stage it is from three to four 
times smaller than the intestinal trichinae. It is never 
met with in the muscles. 

Miescher's Tubes, Psorospermian Tubes, Rainey's Bodies. 
We find not uncommonly, in the longitudinal direction of 
the muscular fibres, lancet-shaped, darkly granular tubes 
(length up to 10 mm., breadth O2 mm.} ; they are found in 
the muscles of swine, oxen, sheep, and horses, which under 
a low magnifying power have a certain resemblance to 
trichinae (Fig. 91) ; but in them every indication of a 
worm is absent. We find instead, with a magnifying 
power of 300 to 400 diameters, that the contents of the 
tube consist of lentil-, bean-, or half-moon-shaped structures, 
densely crowded together, some of them, again, being en- 
closed in a thin-skinned globe. The tubes lie in the sarko- 
lemma of a muscular fibre. 

Analogous structures occur in masses in bags, which hang 
freely in the oesophagus, especially of sheep and goats, having their 
point of attachment to the muscles of the oesophagus. For details on 
signification of these organisms see 93. 2. 

2. HYDATIDS. 

243. The flesh of numerous animals harbours hydatids 
the non-sexual, youthful form of tape-worms, which are 
developed from the hydatids when they find their way into 
the intestinal canal of another suitable animal. The follow- 
ing table gives a conspectus of the species :

The sheep harbours no hydatids pathogenic for man. 

244. The hydatid of Taenia solium (formerly known as 
Cysticercus cellulosce) forms in pork, and that of T. saginata 
in beef, in the adult state, roundish or oval bladders, from 
the size of a pea to that of a cherry, translucent, and filled 
with a watery liquid : these bladders are found not only in 
the muscles but occasionally in other parts of the body. If 
gently pressed and rolled between the fingers they feel com- 
pact, and with a little skill it is almost always practicable 
to evert the neck-process, together with the head (which in

the developed hydatid is visible as a white opaque spot) out 
of its receptacle. 1 

If an entire animal has to be examined, we test first those 
favourite spots of the Cysticercus which are accessible for 
scrutiny the root of the tongue (swine), the heart and 
masseter muscles (ox). In the former locality the hydatids 
may often be seen in the living animal. Hydatids on the 
surface of a piece of meat, which have been dried up and 
thus rendered less distinct, may be rendered visible again 
by steeping in weak acetic acid (Laboulbene). 




FIG. 94. Head of Tacnia solium. 

If the hydatids (Fig. 94) are numerous (from 10,000 to 
20,000 have been found in one pig), the macroscopic diag- 
nosis is very easy. Sporadic hydatids may naturally be over- 
looked, even in the most careful scrutiny of meat, as cutting 
up the muscles for examination of course injures the appear- 
ance of the meat. 

For an accurate diagnosis the head 2 of the Cysticercus is 
everted (Heller), cut off 1 along with the shortest possible

2 Thirty-two days after the infection of an animal with tapeworm-eggs, the 
hydatids are the size of a hemp-seed, with an indication of the position of

they are perfectly developed ; after two and a half months they are capable

piece of the neck, and placed in glycerine with gentle pres- 
sure under a magnifying power of eighty diameters. We 
now search for the four sucking-cups of the worm, and in 
case of the tapeworm of swine we search for the very 
characteristic double garland of hooks, consisting of twice 
sixteen hooks. A single hook, distinctly seen, establishes 
the diagnosis. We must also note the rounded or oval 
calcareous corpuscles which are everywhere imbedded in the 
tissue of the head, which disappear on the application of 
acetic acid, and may assist in the diagnosis in doubtful cases 
(Ostertag). If there is before us only a single hydatid, 
which may have been calcified or boiled, the diagnosis may 
become difficult, as also if the Cysticerci are very young, and 
at the same time very numerous, or are even dead (the 
appearance then reminding us of tuberculosis). In Prussia 
there is 1 hydatised (measly) pig to 324 healthy individuals ; 
in Berlin, 1 to 124. 

In the Cysticercus of the ox, which is in Germany less 
common than in swine, 1 the hooks are wanting. 2 The 
Taenia proceeding from them is also known to be devoid of 
hooks. Especial attention must here be given to the suction- 
cups. The Cysticercus of the ox is also devoid of a distinctly 
prominent rostellum, but they possess in its stead a pit-like 
depression on the surface of the head (so-called frontal 
suction-cup). 

The hydatids of oxen and swine are not well able to resist external 
agencies. Their vitality is always extinguished fourteen days after the 
slaughter of their host. Leuckart never obtained a positive result in 
dietetic experiments with quite fresh ham prepared from hydatidous 
meat. According to Perroncito a hydatid prepared out died on immer- 
sion for one minute in water at 50. 



of becoming a tapeworm in the intestines of another animal. In three to 
six years the Cysticercus dies and is calcified. 

1 The hydatid of swine is decidedly more common, yet in some districts 
Taenia mediocanndlata is much more common in man than Taenia solium. 
The bad habit of eating raw pork is declining, but the consumption of raw 
beef is increasing. In Berlin Ostertag found on careful examination only one 
hydatidous animal among 400, in 1889 and 1890. 

2 Small points are present only in the earlier stages of development, but 
they subsequently disappear without further growth.

245. Echinococci, i.e., the hydatids of the small three- 
jointed tapeworm of the dog (Taenia eckinococcus) , which is 
altogether only 4 to 6 mm. in length occur, very frequently in 
some districts as thin-skinned water-vesicles, especially in 
the liver and lungs of oxen, sheep, and swine. They are more 
rarely found in other organs (the muscles included), none 
being entirely safe from them. 

In South Germany this disease 
is the third in point of frequency 
among those observed on slaugh- 
tering. In Iceland 28 per cent, 
of dogs suffer from Taenia echino- 
coccus, and from 2 to 25 per cent, 
of the inhabitants have the cysts 
of Echinococcus ; 7 per 1000 of 
the bodies dissected at the Patho- 
logical Institute at Berlin have 
suffered from the same cause. 1 

The mature cysts of Echino- 
coccus present the following ap- 
pearance : In a fibrous capsule, 
more or less substantial, lies the 
cyst, very variable in size (from 
1 to 10 cm. in diameter), filled 
tightly with a clear aqueous liquid. 
The side of the cyst, which is very 
distinctly stratified on its (optical) section, presents a very 
characteristic aspect, lined with a ciliated epithelium. In the 
cyst there is always found in young animals, and more rarely 
in aged animals, merely the above-mentioned liquid ; gene- 
rally there are suspended to the side of the cyst the so-called 
brood-capsules, pullulations of the parenchyma, into which 
the epithelial layer extends downwards.

1 In Australia tapeworms and their earlier stages have become a fearful 
nuisance. Public attention is being drawn to the necessity of absolutely 
excluding all animals which may be the hosts of these parasites from access 
to all reservoirs, aqueducts, gathering grounds, and feeders which are con- 
nected with the water-supply of cities. Editor. 



ANIMAL PARASITES. 




FIG. 96. Brood-capsule of an Echi- 
nococcus with Heads of Tapeworms 
according to Schmidt-Multheim. 



By growth and investigation there then appear on the 
brood-capsules the heads of 
the tapeworms with their 
rostellum, four suction-cups 
and their hooks, arranged in 
two series each of 14 to 25 
pieces. From a single brood- 
capsule there may arise numer- 
ous heads (as many as 22). 
Along with this development 
of heads there takes place a 
formation of daughter-cysts, 
which arise in different man- 
ners, and may finally lie either within or without the 
mother-cyst. 

At the great age which the Echinococci often attain we 
find occasionally in the interior of the 
cysts merely detritus, defunct heads with 
detached hooks, the latter floating freely 
in the liquid of the cyst. 

The diagnosis is based : 

1. In typical cases on the macrosco- 

pic appearance of the large cysts, 
which are in part nested within 
each other. This character is not 
always sufficient. 

2. On the microscopic detection of the hooks or of the 

scolices, and the characteristic stratification of the 
sides of the cysts. 

3. On the chemical character of the liquid. It is free from 

albumen, and consequently does not coagulate on boil- 
ing ; it contains small quantities of sugar, inosite 
and succinic acid. 

Fishes have been hitherto but little examined for parasites. 
In botryocephalic regions (Baltic provinces, Western and 
Southern Switzerland, Northern Italy) the corresponding 
Cysticercus has often been frequently found in the species 
mentioned on p. 11.

3. SOME ANIMAL PARASITES OF LESS IMPORTANCE. 

I. Worms. 
I. CESTODES. 

246. 1. Coenurus cerebralis is the cystic worm of Taenia 
coenurus of the dog. It is 30 to 40 cm. in length, and is 
frequently found in the brain and in the spinal cord of 
sheep. Young animals only are susceptible ; old individuals 
enjoy immunity. It is rarer in the ox, and in man it is 
absent. The cysts which are developed and which reach 
their full size in two to three months (varying from the size 
of a pigeon's egg to that of a hen's egg), are provided on their 
internal side with numerous (up to 500) heads, which may 
be everted outwards, and which possess hooks. 

2. Taenia expansa. A large tapeworm which often appears in 
masses in the bowel of young sheep (tapeworm disease), and occasions 
a cachectic condition. Intermediate host unknown. 

II. XEMATODA (ROUND-WORMS). 

3. Ascaris mcgalocephala. The large-headed round-worm or thread- 
worm often occasions intestinal obstruction in horses, and more rarely 
perforation. In oxen Ascaris lumbricoides often occurs. 

4. Strongylus armatus. The embryos are introduced into their host 
(horse) when drinking water. The larvae live in aneurisms of the 
mesenteric arteries ; on migrating thence they suck themselves fast to 
the bowel and become sexually mature (| to 12 mm.) 

Strongylus tetmcantkus encysts itself in the submucosa of the bowel 
of horses. 

5. Strongylus contortus (male from 1 to H ; female, 3 cm. in length) 
establishes itself in masses in the abomasus of young sheep and occa- 
sions there a violent inflammation. The "red stomach-worm disease" 
occasions emaciation and often death. 

6. Strongylus filaria (male from 2 to 3 and female from 8 to 9 
cm.\ white and filiform, produces in the sheep and the goat (as do 
Strongylus micrurus in the ox and Strongylus paradoxus in the swine), in 
the respiratory organs which it infests, bronchitis, lobular pneumonic 
foci, and, finally, nodes of connective tissue inclosing the worms. 
Sheep often die from the parasites occurring in masses. Swine and 
cows certainly suffer, but generally survive the affection. The lungs 
are diseased to a very disgusting extent. Among game also (roe, hare, 
&c.) species of Strongylus effect devastations. Similar is the effect of 
PseudaliiLs capillaris in the sheep and the chamoib. (See Arthur Miiller, 
Nematoden der Siiugcthierlunye. Deutsch. Zeitsch. f. Thiennedicin, 1889.

7. Echinorrhynchus gigas. This powerful worm, with its proboscis 
beset with thorny barbed hooks, bores its way into the intestinal 
mucous membrane in swine (rarely in man), occasioning there inflam- 
mation and waste. Its early form is introduced into swine by the 
larvee of insects. 

III. TREMATODA (FLUKES). 

247. 8. Distomum hepaticum and lanceolatum. Two 
species of flukes are often found in the liver of sheep and 
oxen (more rarely in goats and swine), less frequently in the 
lungs, and extremely rarely in the muscles, the subcutaneous 
tissue, &c. In one liver there may be contained from 500 
to 1000 flukes. Distomum hepaticum is from 1J to 4 cm. 
in length, and from J to 1 cm. in breadth. The accompany- 
ing figure shows more plainly its form, 
leather-brown; it occurs chiefly in the 
enlarged and cretified biliary ducts and 
also the parenchyma of the liver, which 
is often destroyed to a great extent after 
being first attacked with interstitial hepa- 
titis, perihepatitis, and hepatoscirrhus. 
On the surface the worms are mostly 
beset with warty points. From the ova 
of the distoma there are developed in 
water ciliated embryos which undergo 
in small water-snails (Limnceus trun- 
catulus) a farther development to larvae. 
In the larvae occurs their development to 
a second generation of tubular larvae 
(redia), in which there appear tadpole- 
like motile organisms (cercaria), which 
are encysted either in the snails, or more 
frequently whilst adhering to the grass 
after leaving them, and are swallowed by grazing sheep, &c. 

The embryos pass through the biliary ducts into the liver, 
and, in rare cases, into the systemic circulation. In man 
Distomum ranks among the rarest parasites. 

The presence of numerous flukes brings on in consequence 
of the consecutive inflammation of the liver, anaemia, ascites,

and severe sickness in sheep, very rarely in man. The ox 
is very slightly sensitive to the destruction of the liver by 
Hukes. See Schaper, Deutsche Zeitsch. f. Thiermedicin, 1889. 
A complete monograph. Latterly there has often been found 
in the muscles of swine a small Distomum (size of an 
encysted trichina), the meaning of which is obscure. 

Distomum lanceolatum is much smaller, from J to 1 cm. 
in length and from 1 to 3 mm. in breadth, and is in many 
districts very pernicious. It is diffused among domestic ani- 
mals, and has not yet been detected in man. Its inter- 
mediate host is not yet known with certainty; species of 
Helix are suspected. 

2. Articulata. 

248. 9. Pentastoma denticulatum, the flat white larva of Pentastoma 
taenioides, about ^ cm. in length, is often found encysted in the 
abdominal glands and the intestinal coats, or free in the peritoneal 
cavity and in the respiratory passages of sheep, oxen, and other phyto- 
phagous animals. The worm-like larva is not a worm, but an acaroid 
creature (family of Acarinse), and has a body composed of about 
eighty segments, covered with thorns, and four or six feet with 
double retractile claws. 

The larva), which appear to be generally introduced through the 
respiratory passages, are developed in the nasal and pharyngeal cavity 
of the Canidse, and sometimes of man, forming parasites from 2 to 
13 cm. in length, having ninety joints, broad in front and pointed 
behind ; they occasion violent irritation of the mucous membrane, and 
sometimes of the brain. The ova, which are produced in masses, infect 
plant-feeders, and occasionally man. 

10. Oestrus avis. The young larvae of the bot-flies are deposited by 
the female near the nostrils of sheep ; they creep into the cavities of 
the nose, the forehead, and the jaws, grow for three-quarters of a year, 
becoming grubs of from 2 to 3 cm. long, with two large, claw-like, oval 
hooks and eleven yellowish brown segments. When they migrate, they 
occasion in slight cases catarrh of the mucous membrane, in more 
severe cases cerebral symptoms, or even death (spurious staggers). 
Other species of Oestrus may become hurtful by the development of 
their Iarva3 in the stomach of animals, or in cutaneous boils. 1 



1 Certain species of Calliphora and Lucilia, which normally prey upon 
carrion, occasionally become parasitic. Of the.se the screw-worm of Texas is 
the most dreaded. According to Kiiby and Spence, quoted by Westwood 
("Classification of Insects," ii. 569), there have I -en many cases of these 
species depositing their eggs in the wounds of persons sleeping in the open air.

11. It may be mentioned that the following parasites may be trans- 
ferred from the skins of other animals to man : 

Sarcoptes scabiei communis = Sarcoptes major, Gerlach = the large 
acarus of the itch. Lives upon horses, dogs, sheep, and goats. 

Sarcoptes minor, F. and G. Lives on cats and rabbits. 

Dermatophagus and Dermatocoptes are transferred to man only tem- 
porarily, and always perish quickly. 

Dermanyssus avium (blood-sucking bird-tick). Eare on man. 

Leptus autumnalis. The harvest mite or tick. 

Demodex (Acarus) folliculorum. Occasion severe skin disease in dogs ; 
harmless to man. 

B. Vegetable Parasites. 

249. Hitherto we have had merely to test for schizo- 
mycetes. Only the fewest bacterial diseases of animals can 
be detected by an examination of the flesh; it is at most 
unusually pale, infiltrated with saline secretions, or traversed 
by extravasated blood. A diagnosis is often practicable for 
an experienced observer by the state of an entire dissection. 
A bacteriological examination conducted according to the 
methods given in 64 will be decisive for the diagnosis. 
Sometimes a smear-preparation is sufficient, sometimes sec- 
tion-preparations have to be got ready, but especially cultures 
and experiments on animals. 

The most important diseases to be considered are : 
1. Tuberculosis (pearl- disease). 1 Very common in oxen, 
rare in calves, very rare in sheep, goats, horses, cats, and 
dogs ; rather common in swine and in poultry. In the ox, 
tuberculosis generally takes a chronic course with the forma- 
tion of small and large sarcomatous, granulated tumours, 
which have their seat in the serous membranes (pleura, peri- 
toneum, the coating of the diaphragm), but also in the lungs, 
the lymphatic glands, and all the other viscera. These 
luxuriant growths are at first soft, but may afterwards calcify 
or shrivel up like connective tissue ; true tyrosis is rare. 



1 In Bavaria about 5000 tuberculous oxen are yearly slaughtered; in Baden 
about 1 per cent, of the cattle slaughtered are thus affected, at Augsburg 2'2 
per cent., at Munich 2.7 per cent., at Berlin 4'5 per cent., at Copenhagen 
6 per cent., at Frankenberg 16 '6 per cent., and in Zittau actually 22 "4 per 
cent. Swine are rarely infected (about 1 in 4000 in Baden), young calves very 
rarely (1 in 24,000). 



20 MEAT. 

Sometimes such growths are found in an otherwise healthy 
and well-nourished animal in a single locality, as a symptom 
of a purely local disease. In other cases the entire animal 
is pervaded with nodes (the muscles excepted) ; there occur 
at the same time in the lungs pneumonic infiltrations with 
a tendency to tyrosis and purulent liquefaction, so that the 
type of phthisis may be perfectly developed. Less common 
is tuberculosis of the bowels, the genitals, and the udder, &c. ; 
acute miliary tuberculosis is rare. In advanced stages of 
the generalised disease the animals become emaciated, the 
flesh is watery, and the fat disappears. 

The pearly nodes are very characteristic ; in doubtful cases 
the bacillar tubercles must be recognised by staining smear- 
or section-preparations, or preferably by introducing small 
particles into the anterior chamber of the eye, or into the 
peritoneum of rabbits, when tubercular iritis or peritonitis 
appears in about four weeks. For particulars see 46, 51, 
7-4, 75, and 86. 

A pseudo-tuberculosis, observed first by Ebertli and recently by 
A. Pfeiffer (Ueber die bacillare Pseudotuberculose der Nayethiere, Leipzig, 
1889), which occurs in rodents on inoculation and feeding (other ani- 
mals of different classes are not susceptible). The exciter is a bacillus, 
twice as long and three times as broad as Koch's tubercle bacillus. It 
can easily be cultivated upon gelatine, which it does not liquefy, and is 
preferably stained with niethylene blue. The disease spreads especially 
along the lymph-passages ; the nodes and nodules, which appear spe- 
cially in the abdominal organs, shelter the microbia in luxuriant heaps. 
The macroscopic pathological-anatomical aspect is very similar to that 
of tuberculosis ; the differential diagnosis is very easy, according to 
what has been said. This destructive disease of rabbits and guinea-pigs 
has been frequently studied in France. 

2. Glanders = Malleus humid us morve. 

Characteristic alterations in the flesh are absent. Among animals, 
horses are almost exclusively attacked ; goats are rather susceptible to 
this infection, sheep less so, swine scarcely ever. Glanders may be com- 
municated to dogs and cats. Oxen are not susceptible. See 86. 

The three main seats of chronic glanders are : 

1. The nasal septum, and in general the mucous membrane of the 
nose. Round-celled infiltration, with necrotic ulcerated disintegration ; 
lardaceous basis, with a tendency to the formation of pale radiating 
scars. At the same time there occurs nasal catarrh, often on one side 
only. Infiltration of the lymph-glands, especially in the neck. 

2. Lunrjs. Partly disseminated infiltration in the form of whitish 



VEGETABLE PARASITES. 21 

nodules (acute form), partly larger nodes resembling sarcoma (chronic 
form). The granulation tumours may become caseous, suppurate, 
become ichorous, and shrivel up like connective tissue. At the same 
time there occur pneumonic infiltrations. The pulmonary affections 
are very rarely absent, and often indeed are primary. 

3. Skin. Nodes, surrounded by swollen lymph-glands, lie at diffe- 
rent depths -beneath the skin ; they are afterwards resolved into pus, 
and form tumours, which perforate the skin. Nodes occur also fre- 
quently on the internal organs, especially the spleen. 

In acute glanders the most prominent feature is a serous-purulent 
hsemorrhagic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the respiratory 
organs, with formation of ulcers and suppuration, but there may also 
occur affections of the lungs and skin. 

The important diagnosis of chronic glanders is often difficult to 
effect during the lifetime of the subject, in spite of all expedients. 
Staining the bacilli in smear-preparations requires a prolonged applica- 
tion of Loeffler's alkaline methylene blue. For cultures, especially 
on potato, see 86. For a check by inoculating animals it is recom- 
mended to select male guinea-pigs. On inoculating in a fold of skin 
there appear in succession ulcers of the skin and swellings of the 
lymph-glands near the place of the operation, inflammation of the 
testes, inflammation of the joints, nodes of the skin and of the nasal 
mucous membranes. Death generally ensues in four weeks. Strauss 
recommends inoculation of the peritoneal cavity of male guinea-pigs ; 
after twenty-four to forty-eight hours there occurs a typical swelling 
of the testes. 

3. Anthrax (splenic fever). This affection is common in 
oxen and sheep, rare in horses and swine. The spleen is 
strikingly enlarged, brittle; very often there is found a 
hsemorrhagic necrotic inflammation of the bowel and a some- 
what extended sanguineous-gelatinous saturation of the 
connective tissue of the cutis, frequently carbuncular inflam- 
mations of the skin. Lungs, liver, and kidneys hyperaemic, 
and traversed by ecchymoses ; in the acutest cases an almost 
normal section may be observed. The muscles are often 
quite unchanged, though now and then a dark colour and 
interspersion with hasmorrhages may be observed. Even 
when only muscles are available, it will be possible to find 
the bacilli of anthrax on the microscopic examination of 
stained smear- or sectional-preparations (spores are always 
wanting) ; small quantities of blood or of flesh inoculated 
subcutaneously in rabbits, guinea-pigs, or mice produce in 
them fatal anthrax. 



22 MEAT. 

In a case in which a man became fatally diseased after eating ham; 
Tavel demonstrated in the patient a microbe morphologically identical 
with that of anthrax, but which did not kill mice until thirty-one days. 
Anthrax is also a very rare affection in swine ; the case is not quite 
clear (Centralblatt f. Bd., ii. 281). 

4. Cliarbon symptomatique. A pernicious disease of oxen, 
sheep, swine, and horses. The septicaemia disease proceeds 
from deep injuries of the skin or mucous membrane. At 
the point of infection there is sanguineous-gelatinous infil- 
tration of the cellular tissue of the hypoderma ; the adjoining 
muscles are coloured brown or black ; the entire prominent 
tumour is interspersed with gas-bubbles, which crackle or 
rustle on pressure. Sanguineous-serous efflux into the 
hollows of the body and the retro-peritoneal tissue, fre- 
quently haemorrhages in the serous membranes. Spleen 
normal. A certain diagnosis may be effected by means of 
the short characteristic bacilli ( 88). Eabbits and mice are 
almost non-susceptible ; guinea-pigs perish invariably if 
small traces of the muscle are inserted under the skin. 

5. Malignant Oedema. A rare disease in cattle. Not epizootic, but 
widely distributed. State of section as in charbon symptomatique ; the 
development of gas is not absent. 

A certain diagnosis is obtained by the detection of the characteristic 
bacteria (see 88) in the oedema and the organs ; during life they are 
not present in the blood, but they become distributed in it after death. 
All the animals commonly used for experiments are susceptible, even 
rabbits (a distinction from charbon symptomatique). 

6. Pulmonary Disease of Oxen. Interstitial infections, 
pneumonia with secondary hepatisation, and pleuritis. The 
character of the disease approximates to human pneumonia ; 
the tendency to exuberant growth of the connective tissue 
and shrivelling of the tissue gives the lungs, if the animal is 
killed in the later stages of the disease, a peculiarly compact, 
characteristic structure. The ejection of necrotised portions 
is also not wanting. Xo changes are found in the rest of the 
body. The micrococci cultivated by Fuels and Nolen from 
the lungs in this disease are round and have sheaths ; they 
are frequently arranged in short series, and in a gelatine 
plunge -culture they resemble Friedlander's pneumonia 
microbia, but all the cultures become yellow. Injection into

the lungs reproduces the disease in oxen, dogs, rabbits, and 
guinea-pigs. 

Among the pernicious febrile diseases of swine, attended 
with a spotty redness of the skin, and formerly confounded 
as the erysipelas of swine, three are now distinguished : 

7. Bacillary erysipelas, swine erysipelas in the stricter 
sense. A septic, intensely feverish disease tending to 
haemorrhages, violent gastro-enteritis, swelling of the spleen 
and all the lymphatic apparatus, parenchymatic inflammation 
of the organs. A certain diagnosis is founded on the pure 
cultivation of the fine bacillus which Koch described as the 
cause of the septicaemia of mice (see 84). Animals suitable 
for inoculation: house-mice (not field-mice), white rats, 
rabbits become diseased slowly, and guinea-pigs not. 

8. Swine-plague. The most prominent feature is a cheese- 
like, necrotic multiple, lobular pneumonia, accompanied by 
parenchymous degenerations in the liver, kidneys, and heart. 
The spleen, the bowel, and the lymphatic glands are not 
generally much modified. (See 84.) 

Mice and rabbits die quickly, guinea-pigs and rats are not 
easily infected. 

Identical, or nearly allied bacteria, produce the game- and 
cattle-disease (Bellinger), chicken-cholera and the pulmonary 
disease of horses (Kitt, Hiippe), but the appearance of the 
diseases is very different. 

Tri oxen the exantliematic form prevails, strong swelling of the skin, 
enormous gelatinous, subcutaneous infiltration of the connective tissue, 
similar changes in the mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue and 
their submucous membranes. Haemorrhages everywhere. Spleen nor- 
mal, as also the blood. Hsemorrhagic enteritis rarely absent. 

In game there predominates the pectoral form. Jelly-like interstitial 
pneumonia, pleuritis, pericarditis. 

In poultry (chicken-cholera) the prominent feature is hsemorrhagic 
enteritis with desquammation of epithelium and an abundant efflux of 
liquids. There occur haemorrhages into the flesh of the heart, and 
croupy heemorrhagic pneumonia. The flesh is often quite normal, at 
other times of a dark reddish grey, and undergoes lardaceous degenera- 
tion. The most certain diagnosis is obtained by introducing the blood 
into the pectoral muscles of a pigeon, which perishes in from twelve to 
fourteen hours, with a yellowish, caseous infiltration at the place of 
inoculation.

9. Swine disease (hog-cholera). A necrotic enteritis, predominantly 
typhic. Very destructive in America, England, and Sweden. The 
exciter of the infection is not known with certainty. 

10. Pycemia and Septicaemia. In connection with injuries, 
but especially after parturition, pyremic affections often 
occur cryptogenetically. As in man the condition found on 
dissection is very various. In the pycemic forms there are 
especially multiple (embolic) foci of suppuration present in 
the body (in the different organs), along with haemorrhages 
on the serous membranes. In the forms generally known as 
septicaemia every symptom may be wanting except a dull 
swelling and fatty degeneration of most organs (heart, liver, 
spleen, &c.). 

The most common form is the septic inflammation of the 
uterus and udder of cows, the septic inflammation of the 
umbilical cord in calves, &c., and the consequent multiple 
inflammation of the joints. The characteristic symptom is 
here a yellow gelatinous infiltration at the tarsial articulation, 
and the efflux into the joint of a yellow exudation. But 
affections with the aspect of septic gastro-enteritis play here 
an important part. 

In all cases a number of micro-organisms are concerned in 
these processes, the most important of which seems to be 
Bacillus enteritidis. (See 84.) 

Another organism approximating in many respects to the 
typhus bacillus was isolated by Gaifky and Prak from hams 
of horse flesh, which had occasioned a certain dangerous 
illness and one fatal case (Arl. aiis den A'cm. Gesundkeits- 
amt.j vol. vi.). The microbe produced in animals experi- 
mented upon, whether subcutaneously or by way of the 
stomach, diarrhoea, emaciation with fever, paralysis of the 
hinder extremities, and death. 

11. S)ysei)tery in cahcs. Similar to human dysentery, attacks calves 
only in the few first days of their lives, and often destroys them in 
numbers. Its aetiology is unknown. 

12. Diphtheria. The diphtheria of calves, according to Loeffler, is pro- 
duced by large bacteria with an undulating curvature. (Concerning the 
common diphtheria of poultry, and especially of pigeons, see 84 and 
1)3.) Notwithstanding the external similarity of the various animal 



DISEASES FROM UNKNOWN PARASITES. 25 

diphtherias with the typical human diphtheria ( 86) the diseases are 
setiologically quite distinct. 

13. Actinomyces lovis. In 1877 Bellinger detected as the 
common cause of a series of tumour-like diseases in oxen the 
radiating microbe. Between 1870 and 1885, 105 cases have 
been accurately observed. 

Most commonly (50 per cent, of the cases) the microbe produces large 
sarcomatous growths at the angle of the lower jaw, which, where they 
come in contact with the periosteum, often coalesce with it. The lar- 
daceous tumour extends into the bone, strongly rarifying its texture ; 
it includes softer insulated portions, containing yellow or yellowish 
grey glands of the size of a millet-grain. Such growths were formerly 
characterised as osteo-sarcoma ( = wind-thorn = Spina ventosa) ; similar 
growths in the tongue (29 per cent, of the cases) give rise to the forma- 
tion of " wooden tongue ; " the microbe has also been found near the 
oesophagus in the lymphatic glands, in the liver, lungs, the thymoid 
gland, &c. Latterly it has been repeatedly discovered in man as the 
cause of chronic suppuration. For its microscopic appearance see 88. 

A second distinct kind of actinomyces has been found by Dunker in 
pork : Actinomyces muscularum suis. The " lawns " are situate in the 
muscular fibrillse, and have a great tendency to cretification. Compare 
Hertwig (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, i. p. 209). The surrounding flesh 
is, where the microbe is abundant, generally soft, watery, slippery, and 
of a pale yellowish grey. Often we merely find chalky concretions 
which are not easily interpreted. 

The animals slaughtered for food are non-susceptible to many human 
diseases, e.g., typhus, cholera asiatica, diphtheritis, scarlatina, measles, 
whooping-cough, and malaria. 



C. Diseases from Unknown Parasites. 

250. 1. Foot and Moutli Disease (aphthous disease). A 
very frequent infectious disease of oxen, sheep, and swine ; 
more rarely of goats, horses, dogs, and poultry; very 
rarely of man. The termination is generally favourable. 
Along with fever there generally occur blisters and tumours 
on the mucous membrane of the mouth, at the crown, and at 
the division of the hoof; sometimes pustules occur on the 
udder. The infection is conveyed by the saliva and the con- 
tents of the pustules. In the internal organs there are few 
changes ; sucking calves suffer from aphthae and erosions in 
the stomach and the intestinal canal ( 256). 



26 MEAT. 

2. Rabies (hydrophobia). In the rabies of food animals, which chiefly 
concerns us, characteristic changes are generally absent. The symptoms 
before death are generally restlessness, inclination to butt, emaciation, 
paralysis. Death in from four to eight days after the outbreak of the 
disease. 

3. Sheep-pox. Analogous to but distinct from small-pox. In severe 
cases it is frequently complicated with septic processes. 

4. Cattle-plague. Derived from Central Asia, and occasionally deci- 
mating horned cattle and sheep in Europe. The essential feature of 
the process consists in necrotic-diphtheritic insulated deposits in the 
inflamed intestinal tract from the mouth to the large intestine. The 
trachea and the nasal cavity present a similar aspect. The lungs are 
hypersemic, the liver of a clay colour and brittle. The gall-bladder is 
very full ; parenchymatic nephritis. Fatal to from 90 to 95 per cent, 
of the cattle, and to about 60 per cent, of the sheep attacked. The 
death of oxen takes place generally in a few days with great emaciation 
and violent fever. The cause of the infection unknown. Man enjoys 
immunity. 



IV. EXAMINATION OF MEAT FOR POISONS. 

251. As far as inorganic poisons are concerned their 
detection is effected by the methods given under House- 
hold Utensils and Requisites; for organic poisons special 
works must be consulted (see Bibliography under 95). 
Thorough chemical training and experience are here necessary 
for a successful result. An idea of the complication of the 
investigations, which may be necessary under certain circum- 
stances, may be gathered from 256. 

Poisoning experiments with meat which has been rendered 
poisonous by ptomaines, or with its decoctions, &c., are very 
much more promising with rabbits, guinea-pigs, and mice 
than with dogs and cats ; but occasionally positive results 
have been obtained with the latter animals : they are 
certainly not susceptible to the ptomaines of Bac. enter Ltidis. 

B. The Examination of Meat. 
I. Fresh Meat. 

| 252. Hygiene divides fresh meat for convenience into 
four classes, a sharp demarcation between which is im- 
possible : 



FRESH MEAT. 27 

1. Sound meat. Harmless and appetising for man and the 
lower animals, whether in a raw or in a cooked state. 1 

2. Meat which, whether raw or cooked, is harmless to 
man and to the lower animals, but which has more or less 
decidedly disgusting or unappetising properties. 

3. Flesh of diseased animals which, whether raw or 
cooked, is harmless to man, but by which cattle- diseases may 
be propagated. 

4. Meat injurious to man on eating or cutting up. 

a. Hurtful only when raw. 

I. Hurtful also when cooked. 

253. I. Sound meat, harmless and agreeable to man and 
to lower animals, whether raw or cooked. The distinc- 
tion between meat of first and second quality is of sub- 
ordinate importance for hygiene, but it is so practical that 
I give it here. 

As a matter of course the expert in meat subdivides the quality here 
termed la into groups of different excellence, according to the race of 
the beast, its age, its state of nutrition, and especially according to the 
region of the body from which the part in question is taken. Into 
these considerations I cannot enter. 

la. Meat of prime quality. The flesh of beasts rationally 
nourished or fattened, which have been killed either in 
perfect health or affected with the following diseases without 
their general health or state of nutrition being disturbed. 

1. Single organs containing vesicles of Echinococcus or 

Coemmis, pulmonary worms, Distomum, isolated 
Miescher's tubes. 

2. Single organs displaying pathological changes, e.g., 

chronic diseases of the heart or neoplasm confined to 
a single organ. 

The diseased organs are to be destroyed according to 
254 Single specimens of Distomum are found in some 
places in so many livers that they are ignored in deciding 
upon the meat. In Munich, e.g., no sheep's liver can be 
found free from Distomum. 

1 Raw meat, however sound and healthy, cannot well be called appetising 
to the majority of civilised men. Editor. 



28 MEAT. 

1&. Meat of second quality. Here ranks meat which is 
deficient in some of the attributes of enjoyable food, or 
against which slight objections may be raised as to its 
appetising nature. Such meat is generally sold at a reduced 
price at so-called free stalls. 1 

1. Meat from beasts which are too old or too lean; from 

calves which have not yet got eight incisors; from 
cows or oxen which do not weigh at least 200 kilos. 

2. From beasts with localised, scattered, easily removable 

pearl-nodules ; from such in which one or other 
Echinococcus may have been found in the muscles. 
Pork containing a few Adinomyces musculorum suis. 

'->. Of animals which have fallen off in condition in conse- 
quence of chronic affections of single organs. 

4. Flesh of beasts which have been killed from necessity 
in consequence of recent injuries the slaughter to 
take place at latest twenty-four hours after the injury. 
Any indication of infection (strong swelling, fever, 
&c.) excludes the meat. The injured organs are to 
be destroyed. 

254. II. Meat, raw or boiled, not hurtful to man or to 
lower animals, but with more or less pronounced disgusting 
or non-appetising properties : 

1. Meat of intensely unpleasant smell and taste. 

a. Flesh of male breeding animals : bulls, boars, rams. 

b. Flesh of beasts which have absorbed evil-tasting 

or malodorous substances from their food or from 
medical treatment, c.y., by the ingestion of cam- 
phor, carbolic acid, petroleum, balsam of sulphur, 
or by feeding on fish or spoiled oil-cake, &c. 

2. Flesh of animals which have been fed on loathsome but 

tasteless offal (e.g., the fiesh of horses which have died 
a natural death). Demonstrable in general only by 
the evidence of witnesses. 2 



1 Tables or counters in the markets where meat of inferior quality is 
allowed to be sold. 

In some parts of England pigs are fed on butchers' refuse, blood, &c. 
Editor. 



FRESH MEAT. 29 

3. The flesh of unborn or aborted calves, though of healthy 

mothers. The young of diseased beasts are to be 
regarded as dangerous to health. 

4. The flesh of animals drowned or suffocated in smoke. 

The meat is then of a dark brownish-red, and satu- 
rated with blood. The flesh of animals w^ich have 
died of apoplexy is similar. 

5. Meat which has been improperly treated, e.g., by blow- 

ing air into the cellular tissue of the cutis. The air 
thus introduced and its micro-organisms promote 
putridity. 

C. The flesh of hunted or baited animals. Draught-oxen 
which have been over-worked, and fat swine which 
have been over-driven, sometimes perish in a few 
hours. According to Gerlach the flesh is decolorised, 
tender, the transverse striation often imperfect, the 
blood thick, oedema of the lungs, and transuda- 
tions in the serous cavities. The meat is said to be 
even injurious to health, though proof is wanting. 

7. The flesh of animals which have died a natural death, 

when it is testified by a veterinary surgeon that it 
is not decidedly injurious. 

8. Meat and other animal matter containing animal 

parasites. 

a. Such as cannot be transferred to man at all, or at 

least not in the stage of development concerned : 
Distomum hepaticum and lanceolatum, vesicles of 
Echinococcus or Coenurus, Miescher's tubes or 
the actinomyces of swine when very numerous, 
pulmonary worms. Taenia coenurus, Taenia 
echinococcus, and pulmonary worms do not de- 
velop in man; Distomum only if the larvae are 
swallowed, Echinococci only on swallowing the 
ova. 

b. Calcified specimens of parasites which have died 

spontaneously, and which would otherwise be 
dangerous to man, such as Trichinse. 
No objection can be raised against the consumption of 



30 MEAT. 

such meat and its sale at a low price, and with due declara- 
tion it cannot be objected to. Meat infested with parasites 
to a great extent is to be destroyed as exceedingly disgusting. 
Above all things care must be taken that dogs do not devour 
the diseased organs with Coenurus cysts or Echinococci, 
thus infecting themselves and giving opportunity to spread 
parasitic infection. 

| 255. III. In the following diseases the flesh must be 
pronounced exceedingly loathsome and perilous to public 
health, although it may be consumed by men without injury, 
if the beasts are slaughtered at the very onset of the 
disease : 

Cattle-plague, Charbon symptomatique, 

Pulmonary disease, Sheep-pox, 

Bacillary erysipelatous fever, Swine-plague. 

Although the meat of class III., whether raw or cooked, 
has never yet given rise to disease in man mankind not 
being susceptible to the diseases in question yet its sale, 
and, as a rule, its consumption, should be most strictly pro- 
hibited, since such meat, as long as it is raw, may spread 
diseases among animals and seriously threaten national 
prosperity. On the other hand, in districts gravely attacked 
by an epizootic, the use of meat from animals certified by 
the veterinary surgeon as having been slaughtered at the 
commencement of the disease, may be safely allowed to men, 
though, of course, in a cooked state, and with a declaration 
of its nature. In fact, it has been consumed without injury 
on a large scale in epizootics, e.g., cattle-plague. Such meat 
will always, however, be considered disgusting, at least to 
persons not accustomed to it. 

Thorough investigations have shown that whilst the bacilli 
of erysipelas die at 52, boiling, pickling, roasting, and smok- 
ing destroy the bacilli very slowly and imperfectly, and that 
consequently such meat, even when cooked, involves a 
certain danger for the stocks of swine. (Pt-tri, Arbeiten aus 
dcm Kaiserl. Gesundhcits Ami., vi.) 



FRESH MEAT. 31 

Persons in Austria have been taken ill after consuming the flesh of 
erysipelatous swine, which had not been sufficiently cooked. This can 
scarcely have been in cases of bacillary erysipelas, which, according to 
Bellinger and Schottelius, does not render the flesh injurious. The 
flesh of animals affected with swine-disease, as long as it was regarded 
simply as pneumonia, was admitted for food without hesitation, and 
has never occasioned any injury. The meat of animals suffering from 
charbon symptomatique is very commonly consumed in Upper Bavaria 
without penalties ; in Baden it is prohibited. Lemke observed severe 
diarrhoaa in young dogs which had been fed upon such meat. 

' If beasts are slaughtered only in the later stages of the 
disease, the flesh is generally so changed, and is consequently 
so disgusting, that its prompt destruction becomes obligatory. 
It is best to prohibit its use as soon as distinct pathological 
changes are observed on slaughtering. In the later stages 
of the disease there often occurs a mixed infection with 
septic microbia, as in sheep-pox. 

256. IV. We must pronounce unconditionally injurious, 
or suspicious of unwholesomeness, the meat of : 

1. All beasts which have perished from disease, or have 
been slaughtered compulsorily on account of disease, espe- 
cially of a febrile character, except on production of a 
veterinary certificate that it is edible, with a statement of 
the reasons. Here must be included all meat saturated with 
blood, with cedematous liquids, or of a yellow or other ano- 
malous colour, of abnormal taste and smell, unless it is 
referred by veterinary certificate to one of the former 
categories. 

If the presence of diseases is shown which have no in- 
fluence upon the general condition, the use as food of a beast 
slaughtered under such circumstances may be permitted, e.g., 
in tympanitis from fodder of an excessive quantity or un- 
suitable kind, extraneous bodies in the respiratory organs, 
incomplete parturition, accidents of all kinds. The veteri- 
nary surgeon has to decide whether such meat belongs to 
category I. or II. 

In Saxony the flesh of a beast which has been slaughtered 
more than twelve hours after an injury may only be sold on 
production of a veterinary certificate. 



32 MEAT. 

Hygiene cannot pronounce the flesh of animals which have died of 
diseases as injurious per se, especially as death from apoplexy (effusion 
of blood on the brain) must be considered equivalent to death from a 
bullet- wound in the brain. But, in the first place, a beast which has 
died a natural death is not completely bled ; the meat is consequently, 
in our ideas, rendered poor in appearance, if not unappetising, and 
passes quickly into putrefaction. Secondly, the public has such an 
instinctive aversion to the flesh of beasts which have perished that it is 
well to uphold on principle the prohibition of the consumption of such 
meat, unless the official veterinary surgeon places it in category II. 
Concerning certain infectious diseases of beasts to which man is not 
liable see 254 and 255. 

The following diseases of the lower animals are particularly- 
dangerous to man : 

A. Animals affected with glanders, tuberculosis, splenic 
fever, malignant oedema, septic processes, foot and mouth 
disease, possibly also Actinomyces bovis, tetanus, and rabies, 
are dangerous in cutting up and dressing the meat, especially 
in presence of small wounds in the fingers. 

The bacilli of glanders seem able to penetrate through the healthy 
mucous membrane, whence contact with them is in the highest degree 
dangerous to num. Cases of infection with tuberculosis by an injury 
received during dissections and slaughterings are known in great 
numbers. On splenic fever see the following page. 

Foot and mouth disease is sometimes communicated to man by the. 
secretion of the vesicles, to the attendant or to the slaughter-man, and 
leads to a disease quite analogous to that of cattle. 

In the dissection of rabid animals infection has only once been found 
to be communicated to man. The muscular flesh and the blood do not 
contain the poison of rabies. No case of rabies has been recorded from 
eating the flesh of rabid cattle, which has been often observed. In any 
case, no objection can be raised against slaughtering and consuming 
cattle which have been killed after a suspected bite, but before the 
actual outbreak of the disease. 

B. Meat is dangerous if consumed in the following cases : 
a. Dangerous only if consumed in a raw condition, the 

unvvholesomeness being destroyed by cooking: cysticerci and 
trichinae, tuberculosis, glanders, actinomycosis, foot and 
mouth disease. 

From the larval states of T. solium and T. mediocannellata tape- 
worms are developed in the human intestines. (Fur their tenacity of 
life see 243.) 



FBESH MEAT. 33 

Notwithstanding the official inspection, numerous persons still die 
yearly of trichinosis. In 1883, at Deesdorf and Nienhagen, 503 persons 
were infected by the flesh of a single trichinous pig, and 66 of the cases 
proved fatal. In 1865, at Hedersleben, 337 persons were attacked, and 
the deaths were 101. (For their tenacity of life see 241.) 

The bacilli of tuberculosis in meat and milk resist strong attacks 
fairly well : a temperature of 60 for twenty minutes and one of 71 
for ten minutes do not injure them, as little as does desiccation at 30. 
They also resist for a long time putrefaction, salting, and alcohol 
(Galtier, Comptes Eendus, 104 and 105). Dried bacilli remain for months 
capable of life. 

Whilst certain proofs are at hand that tuberculosis may be caused by 
eating the bacilli of tubercle, and whilst no one doubts that the con- 
sumption of raw animal organs interspersed with the nodules of pearly 
disease is highly dangerous, the question, in spite of many investiga- 
tions, is not quite clearly decided as to the dangerousness of the flesh 
of tuberculous animals if the few macroscopic tubercle-nodules are not 
present in the actual pieces of muscle consumed. 

Whilst Johne concluded from the dietetic experiments recorded in 
literature that 4 7 '7 per cent, of the animals experimented upon were 
infected by the ingestion of the raw flesh of tuberculous animals, and 
35'5 per cent, by the use of such meat which had been boiled for ten 
to fifteen minutes, Bellinger (Deutsche Zeitschrift f. Thiermediz., vol. xiv. 
1888) advocates the harmlessness of the flesh of highly tuberculous 
animals if the tubercular nodes (a great rarity) have not been actually 
developed in the muscles. Kastner, with Bollinger, has injected into 
twelve guinea-pigs the expressed juice from the muscles of highly 
tuberculous cattle which had been slaughtered ; and notwithstanding 
the selection of this most certain method of infection, he did not obtain 
any positive results (Munch. Med. Wochenschrift, 1889). In opposition 
to Kastner, Forster found the flesh of animals affected with " pearl - 
disease" often infectious. Steinheil (Munch. Med. Wochenschrift, 1889), 
who with Bollinger injected eighteen rabbits with the juice of Iliopsoas 
from men dead of tuberculosis, obtained entirely positive results. Expe- 
riments with the muscular juice of animals which have died of tuber- 
culosis are still wanting. The confiscation of the flesh of every animal 
which displays tuberculous changes, as done in Berlin, and as resolved 
on by a great majority of votes at the first International Congress on 
tuberculosis at Paris, seems to me not well grounded. The view taken 
by Bollinger seems to be the correct opinion for practice ; animals with 
localised tuberculosis are referred to category 1. 6 ( 254) ; those with 
generalised tuberculosis may at most be utilised for glue and stearine, 
unless means are found of thoroughly boiling the entire flesh before 
sale, as has recently been attempted in several abbatoirs (e.g., in Berlin). 
As long as the meat is not loathsome, this is decidedly the best way 
for its utilisation. 

Pickling and smoking, as practised for the kitchen, do not, accord- 
ing to the experiments of I. Forster with meat containing the nodules

of " pearly disease," appreciably diminish tlie infectious character of the 
bacilli of tubercle. 

Attacks of glanders in animals (especially in the Felidse), in conse- 
quence of infective food, have been observed in zoological gardens. No 
infection has hitherto been demonstrated in man from the use of such 
meat (Decroix even ate the raw flesh without injury), but the possibility 
of infection is beyond doubt (e.g., by raw sausages made of horse-flesh). 

Diseases in man which can be with certainty referred to the use of 
organs containing actinomyces as food are hitherto not known ; but 
the possibility of infection must be unconditionally admitted, espe- 
cially for the actinomyces of oxen. Meat containing such parasites 
is always disgusting. 

In Berlin pork interspersed with actinomyces is destroyed, but Johne 
considers this unnecessary. 

Foot-and-mouth disease has not hitherto been certainly transferred 
to man by the use of meat, and when cooked the meat is harmless ; 
but the raw meat should be handled carefully, as man enjoys no 
immunity against the disease. (See Milk.) 

13. Meat is dangerous, both in a raw and a cooked state, in 
eases of : splenic fever, malignant oedema, sepsis, and chicken- 
cholera. 

An incomplete salting for fourteen days does not suffice to 
kill the bacilli in a ham from a pig affected with splenic fever. 
'Salting for H months is effective (Peuch, Comptes Hendus, 
ex. p. 285, 1887). Desiccated bacilli free from spores, ac- 
cording to Koch, are capable of survival for at most ft ve weeks. 

Well-boiled splenic fever flesh is seldom dangerous, as the sporeless 
bacilli perish at 60, and no great quantities of ptomaines are contained 
in the meat. Meat in the raw state is, on the contrary, very dangerous. 
If the meat is kept in a warm place (20 to 25), the bacillus develops 
spores on tlie surface of the meat (Schmidt-Muhlheim, Centralblatt f. 
Baderiologie^ vi.), which for a short time (from one to five minutes) 
resist even the temperature of ebullition, and can bear 80 for half an 
hour. Twelve cases of illness occurred in Germany in 1887 from the 
consumption of splenic fever meat, as against seventy-eight from flaying 
the carcases. Bollinger (Zoonosen) reports several cases where the 
butchers were taken ill, though the consumers remained in health. 
The symptoms of infection in man proceeding from the bowels are : 
sudden severe sickness, with languor, nervous symptoms, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, cyanosis, collapse. Cuticular carbuncles and the cedema of 
splenic fever may also occur in infection by way of the bowels. I am 
not able to find any certain statements concerning malignant oedema. 
The consumption of poultry suffering from chicken-cholera has occa- 
sioned sickness in man. 



FRESH MEAT. 35 

Of by far the greatest importance in practice is the poison- 
ous character of the flesh of cattle suffering from septic 
pyaemic processes. The flesh is generally pernicious, whether 
boiled or raw. Boiling indeed often slightly diminishes its 
malignity, but the broth has often been found intensely 
poisonous. The meat, therefore, along with pathogenic mi- 
crobia, contains the poisonous products of their metabolism. 

It is beyond doubt that various kinds of septic bacteria 
may have occasionally come into action. Hitherto only a 
few cases of meat-poisoning have undergone a careful 
bacteriological study. For the results see 2-49. The 
symptoms of the cases studied by Gaertner and referred to 
Bac. enter itidis were : violent catarrh of the stomach and 
bowels (sometimes with blood in the evacuations), with deep 
prostration, weakness of the heart, with rapid pulse, fever, 
pains in the limbs. On dissection, there appears strong 
injection of the small intestine, which is filled very full; 
smaller and larger haemorrhages in the most varied organs, 
especially underneath the mucous membrane ; the spleen not 
enlarged. 

The symptoms of an acute septic enteritis as here described 
predominate in the majority of the cases of meat-poison- 
ing which have been reported, though individual cases show 
a number of variations. Sometimes there occur nervous 
symptoms (paralysis of the muscles of the eyes, troubles of 
the pupils, difficulties of deglutition, &c.). In Gaertner's epi- 
demic, convalescence was accompanied with desquamation 
of the skin of the fingers; in other cases nettle-rash has 
been observed. 

A second group of diseases after the use of meat takes 
the aspect of cholera (see, e.g., Hygien. Rundschau, i. 196). 

A third group, lastly, of meat-poisoning cases assumes the 
deceptive clinical aspect of Typhus dbdominalis ; the incuba- 
tion is more prolonged (generally from four to nine days). 
On dissection, the results seem to support the diagnosis as 
Typhus abdominalis (tumour of the spleen, ulcerated intestine). 
Here must be placed the two most extensive " flesh 
epidemics " hitherto known (see Die Fleischvergiftungen von 



36 MEAT. 

Andelfingen [1839, 391 cases, 10 deaths] and Klolen [1878, 
657 cases, 6 deaths] by Dr. J. J. Suter, Hygienische Tages- 
fragen, vi., Munich, 1889). In any case, notwithstanding all 
approximations, there is here no question of Typhus dbdomi- 
nalis, against which all the lower animals possess an 
immunity, but of a septic micro-organism of pathogenic 
attributes. In the Kloten epidemic the cause was traced 
with certainty to two young calves which had been attacked 
with septic disease. Many secondary cases in the families 
of the patients were especially noteworthy. 

2. The flesh of all animals which have perished with the 
symptoms of an acute poisoning by organic compounds. 
Strong views were formerly taken on the dangerous character 
of the flesh, not only of poisoned animals, but of such as had 
been treated with organic medicines. In fact, literature con- 
tains a number of cases of this kind, though certainly lacking 
in part full critical observations. 

Thus there have been observed beef rendered poisonous by 
atropine ; poisonous flesh of lambs which had been experi- 
mentally killed with mix vomica ; in Australia, poisonous 
flesh of sheep which had perished from brow r sing poisonous 
cucurbitaceoe (Jahresbericht f. Pkarmak, 1871) ; poisonous 
fishes poisoned with Cocculus indicus ; poisonous snails which 
had fed upon the box-tree. A large dose of powder of 
hellebore, which had been administered to a cow medically by 
a quack, rendered its flesh poisonous. Eecent experiments 
by Frohner and Knudsen completely demonstrated the harin- 
lessness, both to men and dogs, of the flesh of sheep which 
had been fatally poisoned with eserine and strychnine, pilo- 
carpine and veratrine (Zcitsclirift /. Fleisch u. Milclihygienc, 
vol. i.), whence they infer that it is impossible to render 
flesh poisonous by the medical treatment of the animals. 
This naturally holds good only for the muscles, liver, 
kidneys, and heart. On the contrary, the stomach and the 
intestinal canal may easily become poisonous. 

An animal may easily be rendered sick by metallic 
poisons (especially lead and arsenic), but its flesh is not thus

mental poisoning cases only in traces in the tissues. 
Sonnenschein found in 1 kilo of the flesh of a cow, which, 
in the course of six months had taken medicinally 506 grm. 
of arsenic, only 04 mg. After the ingestion of tartar emetic 
Harms showed the harmlessness of the flesh. As various 
poisons are found in large quantities, the stomach, along 
with the entire intestinal canal, should be removed by way 
of precaution. Concerning arsenic, and especially concern- 
ing copper and zinc, there exist, in fact, statements as to their 
presence in the liver in a relatively high proportion. That 
meat may become poisonous by the accidental introduction 
of lead (use of leaden chopping block, &c.) is a matter of 
course. 1 

II. Meat in Incipient Decomposition. 

257. 1. The flesh of healthy, and still more of diseased 
animals, when beginning to pass into putrid decomposition, 
may become exceedingly dangerous. A slightly putrid odour 
does not, according to Gerlach, indicate injurious decomposi- 
tion if the meat is from healthy animals, " but if it really 
stinks, and has become inferior-looking, brittle, and smeary, 
if the loose connective tissue between the muscles, and 
especially between the muscular fasciculi, has taken a 
greenish colour or is quite decayed, whereby the meat on a 
cut surface appears porous," it must be rejected as injurious. 
Long before this point it is naturally disgusting : Haut gout. 
( 239.) 

It is said that negroes often reject as exceedingly disgust- 
ing raw fresh meat and eggs, whilst they consume readily, 
and even by preference, the semi-putrid residues of the meals 
of beasts of prey, stale and half-hatched eggs, if only they 
are cooked. 

A multitude of cases have been published in which meat, 

1 The author does not raise the question whether the flesh of poultry, 
rabbits, &c., may become poisonous by feeding upon plants or insects which 
are perfectly harmless to them, though dangerous to other animals. French 
army surgeons in Algeria report that the frogs there prey largely on 
cantharides, and that the soldiers by eating such frogs are sometimes 
attacked with cystitis. Editor. 



38 MEAT. 

fish, pates, lobsters, &c., were consumed when fresh and 
proved to be perfectly wholesome, whilst the very same 
viands, if eaten one day or a few days later, occasioned the 
most severe sickness. (See, e.g., Schmidt-Miilheim in the Zeit. 
f. Fleischbeschau und Fleischproduction, 1887, H. 3, 4, 5.) 

Here we unquestionably have to do with the formation of 
ptomaines by means of bacteria which in any manner (from 
the air or from impure surroundings) find their way into 
food. Properties which particularly strike the senses are 
mostly absent in such " spoiled " foods. Hence, in deciding 
upon doubtful cases, every slight indication of spoiling, 
such as a somewhat modified smell, taste, colour, appearance, 
consistence, &c., must once for all be characterised as ex- 
ceedingly suspicious, and possibly dangerous. The symptoms 
observed after the consumption of such spoiled foods have 
the greatest similarity to those produced by the ingestion of 
the flesh of animals suffering from septic disease. The types 
of disease in individual cases vary greatly, according to the 
ptomaines which have been generated. 

Recently A. Pfeiffer and Schmidt-Miilheim detected between the 
layers of a "salmon-ham" (i.e., salted salmon), which, notwithstanding 
the faultless appearance of the meat, had occasioned injury to health, 
a curved bacillus, which produced slimy masses, and was easily culti- 
vated on artificial media. 

There is especial danger in the consumption of the flesh 
of morbid (especially septically morbid) animals when it has 
been kept for a long time. The formation of ptomaines, 
which had begun during life, evidently increases considerably 
afterwards. Such meat decomposes with exceptional rapid- 
ity ; the more rapidly any meat decays, the more dangerous 
it usually becomes. 

2. Mouldy meat is loathsome and suspicious. 

3. It is not easy to decide once for all concerning " lumi- 
nous meat." Bacterium phosphorescens (see 239), which in 
our climates is the main cause of luminosity, forms, if cul- 
tivated in broth, no poisons. (See K. B. Lehmann and 
Tollhausen, Centralblatt /. Bacteriologie, v.) As we learned, 
luminous meat is roasted in masses, and is eaten without 



SOME NOTES ON AQUATIC ANIMALS. 39 

injury. The development of the luminous bacillus does not 
therefore per se involve any injury to health ; it is not even 
an indication of abnormally long preservation, or of too high 
a temperature of the larder, &c. Still such meat is decidedly 
disgusting, and the possibility that, along with the harmless 
luminous bacilli, injurious microbia may have been developed, 
is never excluded. In decided putridity the luminosity 
diminishes, or is quite extinguished. 

APPENDIX I. SOME NOTES ON AQUATIC ANIMALS. 

258. Whilst in our climate there occurs no mammal or 
bird the flesh of which is per se poisonous, some otherwise 
much admired aquatic animals are at times poisonous. 
Especially in the perch (Perca fluviatilis), sometimes also in 
the pike and the burbot (Gadus lota), the roe and the ovaries 
at the time of spawning contain poisons which act like 
cholera, though the males are usually harmless. Mussels 
are sometimes altogether very poisonous, especially the liver 
and the ovaries. In mussels it is proved that their residence 
in polluted waters is the cause of the poison, which, accord- 
ing to Schmidtmann, disappears in pure sea-water ; a similar 
cause is conceivable in many cases for fish. 

Poisonous perches have no peculiar external feature ; 
poisonous mussels have generally thin shells, not of a dark 
blue, but brownish ; the flesh and the alcoholic extract are 
of an orange-yellow ; the smell often resembles that of wad- 
ding. Mussels of this appearance are not admissible for 
consumption. An exact decision as to their poisonous nature 
can be obtained only by an experiment on rabbits (subcu- 
taneous injection of a concentrated decoction of mussels). 
Brieger has prepared several ptomaines from poisonous 
mussels. 

Similar observations have been made concerning poisonous 
oysters, shrimps, crabs, &C. 1 

1 The mackerel (Scomber scombrus) is accused of being occasionally poisoncms. 
The evidence is scarcely satisfactory, and the reported cases may be traceable 
to incipient decomposition, which in this fish sets in rapidly.

Stale, diseased, or dead aquatic animals (fish, crabs, mussels, &c.) are 
to be regarded as loathsome, and under certain circumstances very 
dangerous to health. Eisner regards crabs which have died of the 
saprolegnia plague as dangerous to health. Crabs boiled after a natural 
death do not display rolled-up tails. Concerning fishes poisoned with 
Cocculus indicus see 256. 

APPENDIX II. EGGS (EGGS OF THE COMMON FOWL). 

259. It is well known that a fresh egg is translucent if 
we hold it in the hand, closed in the shape of a tube, and 
look through it up at the bright sky ; putrescent or incu- 
bated eggs are less pervious to light. Fresh eggs sink at 
once in a solution of common salt containing from 5 to 10 
per cent. ; stale eggs, which have lost weight by the evapo- 
ration of water and the absorption of air, float more or less 
perfectly. The albumen of eggs which have been kept in 
milk of lime or otherwise preserved for a long time loses the 
property of being beaten up to froth. 

As long as an egg does not betray itself as bad by smell, 
and taste, it can scarcely ever be unwholesome. Incubated 
eggs are disgusting, but not hurtful, unless putrescent. 
Preserved egg-albumen may become very dangerous by the 
formation of ptomaines (Glasrnacher, Berlin. Klin. Woclien- 

xrhrift, 1886).

SECTION VII. 

PREPARATIONS OF MEAT AND PRESERVED 
MEATS. 

1. Sausage. 

260. In preparing sausage, chopped meat or the blood 
and internal organs (liver, lungs, heart) of various slaugh- 
tered beasts, along with salt and other condiments, are filled 
into the cleansed bowels (more rarely, the bladder and the 
stomach) of oxen and swine, and recently into cases of 
parchment. 

The exact composition of sausages varies enormously in 
different districts, but the following types recur constantly : 

1. Meat sausage. Pork, veal, beef, and fat. Smoked, boiled, or 

roasted. 

Here belong " cervelat " sausage, the sausages of Lyon, Eatis- 
bon, and Gotha, ham sausage, garlic sausage, Frankfurt roasting 
sausage, &c. 

2. Black pudding. Chiefly swine's blood and pork fat. If much 

cartilage or bacon is added, the result is rind sausage. 

3. Liver sausage. 1 Liver, kidney, omentum are finely chopped, along 

with sinews and cartilage. It is boiled or roasted like the 
former. 

4. White sausage. Pork and veal with onions, white bread, and milk. 

Boiled. 

As additions, pepper and salt are constantly used, and in end- 
less variety : pimento, saltpetre, coriander, bay, cloves, onions, 
garlic, chives (Aliium sclwenoprasum), pistachios, basil, marjoram, 
truffles, sardines, &c. 

The preservation, according as the sausages have to be kept 
for a longer or shorter time, is effected in various manners. 



1 Liver cheese is a mixture of liver and blood with meal and bread-crumbs. 
It is not filled in skins, but sold as a cheap paste. The decision on this cheap 
product (very popular in Munich) does not come under this heading. 



42 PREPARATIONS OF MEAT. 

1. Sausages for prompt consumption are : 

a. Boiled or kept at 70 for at least twenty minutes (scalded). 

b. Smoked. 

a. Kept in smoke for sixty to ninety minutes. In order 

to remove the wrinkles they are afterwards scalded. 
ft. Subjected to the " rapid smoking process." (See 26.) 

2. Sausages for longer preservation are always poorer in water, and 

are more carefully smoked : 

a. They are wrapped in paper or linen (to prevent the deposition 

of soot) and suspended in smoke for a long time ; or, 

b. They are repeatedly brushed over at short intervals with a 

mixture of 1 part pyroligneous acid (wood vinegar) to 3 
parts of water. The acid is allowed to soak into the 
sausage in a warm place, and is then brushed over again. 
The process is complete in one day. On the large scale 
this method is almost exclusively applied. 

It is manifest that in the manufacture of sausages a large 
quantity of inferior meat is used, which as such would not 
find ready sale, 1 e.g., the abdominal muscles, the neck, &c. To 
this no objection can be raised, though other circumstances 
render a strict hygienic control necessary. It is most impor- 
tant to ascertain the proportion of water, starch, foreign 
colouring matters, the use of diseased or spoiled meat, bad 
skins, and the freshness of the sausage. 



A. EXAMINATION OF SAUSAGE. 
I. Examination of the Chemical Constituents. 

2G1. 1. Proportion of water. About 20 gins, are com- 
minuted, spread out, dried at 100 for about twenty-four 
hours, and weighed. 

2. Fat and album c no ids, if necessary, according to 211. 

3. Starch. Latterly it has become customary to add to 
the sausage mass starch, from 2 to 5 per cent, (up to 20 !). 

Detection. The cut surface of such sausages, if touched 

J It must be pronounced disgusting when the embryos of calves found on 
slaughtering cows are chopped up. The common practice of using the blood 
of beasts caught during slaughtering is very dangerous, as they may after- 
wards be condemned on inspection. 

[Blood should never be used for human food ; its proper employment is in 
making manures. Editor.} 



EXAMINATION OF THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS. 43 

with an iodised solution of potassium iodide, turns blue. 
In uncooked sausages we can detect with the microscope 
blackish-blue clots ; in cooked samples there appears a more 
diffused blue colour, as the starch is converted into paste. 
The qualitative examination is always certain if the result 
is strong ; every sausage contains, indeed, small quantities of 
starch in the spices (pepper), but these are never sufficient 
to occasion a diffused macroscopic blue stain over the cut 
surfaces on the application of iodine. The quantitative deter- 
mination is effected by converting the starch into sugar ( 221). 

4. Colouring-matters. Portions are extracted with ethylic 
or amylic alcohol ; if anything dissolves with a red colour, 
artificial colouring- matters are present. Colours are also 
used which cannot be thus detected, e.g., cochineal, soluble in 
ammonia. 

5. Saltpetre. To give the meat a fine red colour, saltpetre 
is universally employed, but it "has no preservative action. 

Detection. The qualitative detection is effected in an 
aqueous solution as directed in 181. Eabuteau recommends 
(Gaz. Mdd. de Paris, 1874) to prepare an extract in hot 
water free from fat, to precipitate it for quantitative deter- 
mination with lead acetate, to remove the lead from the 
filtrate by means of soda, and to filter again. If the filtrate 
is now evaporated to dryness and extracted with absolute 
alcohol, the nitrates are left so pure that they may be 
dissolved in water and determined as in 181. Small 
quantities of nitric acid may be derived from the water used. 
According to Menges (Serafini, Archiv f. Hygiene, xiii.), 
there are added to sausages which have to be kept for a long 
time from 2 to 4 grm. per kilo, of meat ; to such as are to 
be promptly consumed, from ^ to 1 grm. Serafini found 
O05 to 0'55 per cent. About half the sausages contained no 
saltpetre at all. 

Saltpetre is a decided poison. 5 grm. can occasion serious 
illness, and 8 grm., though mostly from 8 to 15 grm., have 
proved fatal. The literature at my disposal contains nothing 
on saltpetre poisoning, acute or chronic, from the consump- 
tion of meat. 



44 PREPARATIONS OF MEAT. 

Serafini has recently collected a large number of state- 
ments from the literature of the toxicology of saltpetre 
(Archiv f. Hygiene, xiii.), from which I borrow the result 
that there has been observed a very variable degree of sen- 
sitiveness to poisoning with saltpetre. On one occasion 1 
grm, produced nausea, vomiting, and long persistent want of 
appetite (Kemmerich). The nitrates pass partly in the 
body into nitrites, which are much more poisonous. 

The question as to the poisonous character of saltpetre 
seems to require a special experimental investigation. 

6. Organic poisons. Ptomaines. See 79. 

This investigation may be very readily found needful, but 
it can be undertaken only by a chemical specialist. (See 
Ehrenberg, Zeit. f. pliysiologische Chemie,l887, vol. xi., and 
Brieger, Zeit. f. Fleisclibescliau, 1888, No. 9.) "Sausage 
poison " is no unitary or constant substance. 

II. Examination of the Flesh of Diseased Beasts. 

262. Animal parasites. Concerning trichinae see 241. 

Cysticerci are easily found by the following method 
(/Schmidt-Mulhewi) : In a conical glass there are placed 
along with about 10 grm. of sausage 100 cc. hydrochloric 
acid at J per cent., and 5 cc. of pepsine-glycerme (obtained 
by allowing the mucous membrane of the purified stomach 
of a dog or a pig to soak with glycerine for eight days, and 
then digesting it from four to six hours at 40 with frequent 
stirring). Whilst the flesh and the cysticercus vesicles are 
dissolved and the fat floats on the surface, the head-processes 
of the cysticerci are scarcely attacked by the pepsine, and 
sink to the bottom as masses resembling grains of rice, 
showing a distinct transverse sulcation. The head may be 
separated by means of preparing needles. In dilute glycerine 
under a magnifying power of about 100 diameters the suc- 
tion pits may be distinguished, and, in case of Cysticercus 
cellulose, the hooks. It is more difficult to find in the sedi- 
ment the portions of membrane with the heads of Ecliino- 
coccus armed with small hooks. 



CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SAUSAGE. 45 

The smell, the taste, the consistence, and the colour are 
to be carefully examined. 

Bacteriological examinations (see 239) show very high 
numbers of microbia. Deetjen (Dissertation, Wiirzburg, 1890) 
detected in 1 grm. of fresh " Lyon sausage," according to the 
time of boiling : 

Unboiled, quite fresh .... 1,894,000 scliizomycetes 
Kept unboiled for four days . . 6,654,000 

Boiled by the author for quarter of an 

hour 61,000 

Boiled by the author for half an hour . 9,000 

Obtained fresh from the maker (ready for use) : in winter, from 
324,000 to 448,000 ; in summer (better boiled), from 14,000 to 37,000. 

Sporiferous bacilli, chiefly of species which bordered on Bac. mesen- 
tericus vulgatus. They must have been present partly as bacilli, but 
partly in the state of spores. In " cervelat " sausage, made at Gotha, 
and faultless in appearance, microbia were found up to 5^ millions, 
doubtless on account of the long preservation. 

Much more important than such enumerations is the 
search for pathogenic species which are little affected by 
the ordinary preparation of sausages. See the statements of 
(Jaffkyand Paak, 249, 10. Compare also the notices in 
266. The researches of Serafini at Munich (Archiv f. 
Hygiene, xiii.), like our own, showed chiefly a spore-bearing 
microbe, which he determined as Bacillus mesentericus vul- 
gatus, and which, according to him, is derived from the 
sausage-skins employed. 

B. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SAUSAGE. 

263. 1. Proportion of Moisture. Very watery sausages 
of low value are often met with in trade (with or without 
starch). 

Trillich found at Munich in ordinary meat sausages from 
63 to 79 per cent, of water. A degree of moisture of more 
than 70 per cent, characterises these sausages as inferior. 
Konig regards 56*6 per cent, as the maximum, and from 40 
to 50 per cent, as the normal moisture of good sausages. 

Of course sausages rich in water are more liable to decom- 
position than others, and are on this account open to objec- 



4 6 PREPARATIONS OF MEAT. 

tion. It seems that for cheap sausages the determination of 
moisture is the most important point. 

2. The Addition of Meal '(crumbs of white bread must be 
considered similar). According to the assertion of the 
makers, the addition of starch is to 

1. Render the sausage-mass more coherent. 

2. Improve the appearance. 

The intention in adding starch is at the same time : 

1. To substitute cheap starch for a part of the more 

expensive meat. 

2. To produce a more hygroscopic and at the same time 

more showy sausage. 

3. To prepare a coherent sausage from inferior, sparingly 

coherent meat. 

4. To protect the sausage against loss of weight on keeping. 

Sausage free from starch loses from 10 to 15 percent, 
in three or four days ; such as contain starch, it is 
said, much less. 

Points 1, 3, and 4 depend upon correct though covetous 
considerations ; but as regards point 2 we must remark : 

It is certain that a sausage, if boiled for a time for con- 
sumption, retains decidedly more water (from 20 to 25 per 
cent, more than raw) if from 3 to 5 per cent, of starch has 
been added, as Naumann and Long observed (Ckem. Zdtung, 
ix. 97). Of course such a boiled sausage is bulkier and 
heavier. But if the sausage, as it is customary in many 
places in South Germany (especially Munich), is not really 
boiled, but merely laid in water at TO 3 for twenty or twenty- 
live minutes, the proportion of starch (from 1 to 10 per 
cent.) is without influence on the power of retaining water. 
Sausages made experimentally with very watery meat (up to 
79 per cent.), and free from starch, lost only from J to 3i- 
per cent, of their water, whilst others prepared with an 
addition of starch behaved the same. (Trillich, Sixth Meeting 
of the Association of Bavarian Chemists, 1887.) 

The superior courts have predominantly pronounced 
against sanctioning an addition of meal : 

1. Because it is unnecessary if good materials are employed 



CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SAUSAGE. 47 

(sausages of the most celebrated makes are always 
found free from starch). 

2. Because it aims at a deception of the public, at least by 

substitution of meal for meat, and sometimes even of 
water for meat. 

See Bellinger, Zeit. f. Thiermedizin, iii. 1887. 
Except the decrease of the nutritive value, it does not 
appear that any hygienic grounds tell against this use of 
meal, but that is sufficient to call for the opposition of 
physicians. It has not been shown that paste sausages spoil 
more rapidly. 

3. Oolouring-matters. Even the employment of harmless 
colouring-matters for dyeing sausage mass is objectionable. 
If the pigment is non-poisonous, its use probably shows a 
desire to make an inferior product appear better. An infe- 
rior article will not rarely prove at the same time unwhole- 
some. Eeichhardt (Archiv f. Pharmacie, 1873) describes 
the illness of an entire family from the consumption of 
coloured though non-arsenical sausages. 

4. Use of the Flesh of Diseased Animals. All circum- 
stances which render fresh meat unwholesome or more or 
less disgusting exclude it on principle from use in sausage-r 
making. In view of the difficult control of sausages, hygiene 
must demand that only meat of the categories La, and b 
shall be employed. 

Fresh sausages have often proved poisonous, especially if the flesh 
of septic beasts has been used, chiefly in raw sausages or in such as 
have been imperfectly boiled or roasted. The flesh of healthy horses 
is not objectionable for sausage meat, but its use must be stated to the 
purchaser ( 238). 

Similarly, the bowels of diseased beasts must be rejected 
as utterly loathsome and dangerous such, e.g., as contain 
tubercular or septic ulcerations. 

264. 6. Spoiled Sausages. The slightest suspicion of 
corruption, the slightest change in the smell, taste, colour 
and consistence of a sausage exclude it from consumption. 
The fearful dangers of sausage-poisoning must determine us 



48 PREPARATIONS OF MEAT. 

to take up the strictest point of view. Poisonous sausages 
are smeary, pasty, slightly acid, and have readily a putrid 
odour and taste. The colour is mostly changed from red to 
grey. Cases, however, have been recorded in which sausages 
of alleged faultless properties have proved poisonous. As 
yet, certain indications for poisonous sausages have heen 
wanting. 

The changes begin in the interior of the sausage, where 
the preservative action of the smoke has penetrated least; 
thick sausages which have been kept long are especially 
dangerous. Kussmaul described a case where the flesh of 
a diseased cow was consumed without injury, whilst a 
" Schwartenmagen " l prepared from portions of the cow 
very quickly occasioned the most violent poisoning (Archiv 
f. Klin. Med., iv.). 

The symptoms of sausage-poisoning vary considerably in 
individual cases, but the following are rarely absent : gastro- 
enteritic phenomena, intense debility, dryness of the oeso- 
phagus, paralysis of different muscles, especially of the eye, 
and difficulty of deglutition. Disturbances of consciousness 
have likewise often been observed. For the bibliography 
of the subject see Spiit in Friedreick's Blatter, 1889, p. 469. 

2. Tinned Meat and other Tinned Pre- 
parations of Animal Origin. 

265. The contents of the tins are sterilised by heat. If 
they are of a fresh odour and of an unsuspicious taste, their 
examination must extend principally to : 

1. Water, fat, albumen, and common salt, in order to 

decide upon the nutritive value. 

2. Preservative agents : common salt, boric acid, salicylic 

acid, saltpetre. 

3. Metals that have been dissolved off the sides of the 

tins: lead, tin, zinc, copper. (See 460, 461, and 
462.) 



Sausage-meat containing much fat and cartilage, and filled into a stomach. 



SALT MEAT, DRIED AND SMOKED MEATS. 49 

Schiitzenberger and Boutmy detected in sixteen tins of preserved 
meats, in which they examined only the layer in contact with the metal 
in 100 grm. : from 5 to 125 'mgrrn. of tin, from 8 to 148 myrm. of lead, 
and considerable traces of copper. A great portion was probably 
derived from the solder. 

The examination for trichinse and echinococci is effected 
without especial difficulty as in sausage. The meat of dis- 
eased animals cannot in general be detected. Of course 
every indication of an escape of blood into the muscles, or of 
other pathological symptoms, must be regarded as disgusting 
and as suspicious in regard to unwholesomeness. If the 
contents of the tins are spoiled, if they have a suspicious 
smell (especially on cooking) or taste, they must be regarded 
as extremely dangerous. The contents of tins, which were 
originally sound, if left standing open in the air may become 
poisonous from the formation of ptomaines. Thus, according 
to Camus (Rev. d' 'Hygiene, 1877), the first half of the con- 
tents of a tin of lobsters was harmless, but the rest a few 
days afterwards was very poisonous. 

The presence of bacteria in tinned meat, as it has been 
sometimes found (for the bibliography see Serafini), by no 
means proves it to be spoiled. The resistent spores of bacilli 
may survive the process of sterilisation without endangering 
the product in the tin, at least at a cool temperature. Of 
pathogenic bacteria the spores of splenic fever have at most 
once remained alive. 

All that has been said applies to ordinary salt meat, in which it must 
be remembered that common salt (up to 5 per cent.) penetrates into the 
meat by diffusion, whilst some albumen and considerable quantities of 
extractive matter and of the salts of the meat are dissolved out. 



3. Salt Meat, Dried and Smoked Meats, 
Hams. 

266. The meat used for such treatment must strictly 
correspond to the general requirements for meat to be used 
as food. Smoking and drying, salting and pickling, attack 
the animal and vegetable parasites in very different degrees. 

VOL. II. D 



5 o PREPAKATIONS OF MEAT. 

Trichinse ( 241) and ecchinococci ( 243) are attacked much 
more readily than bacteria, among which only bacilli of 
splenic fever, free from spores, show great sensitiveness. 
The most necessary details for the several bacteria are given 
in 71 and 81. 

Compare the more extensive works of Freitag and Forster 
(Archiv f. Hygiene, xi.) and Beu (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, 
viii. 513). 

Ptomaine-poisonings by decayed hams have been observed 
in considerable numbers. 

Dried and pulverised beef, in consequence of slight de- 
composition of the fat, readily assumes a more or less 
unpleasant odour, which (along with other causes) has 
hitherto frustrated all attempts to introduce meat-powder 
(carne pura, &c.) as a popular article of diet. 

4. Preserved Fish. 

267. For preserved fishes no method of examination has 
been generally adopted except that by the senses. The 
strictest judgment of anything in the least suspicious is a 
duty, since corrupting, and especially badly preserved, fishes 
have often given rise to severe epidemics. Poisoning cases 
have especially occurred in the south of Eussia from the 
consumption of sturgeons salted and kept in pits. 

liecently Arustamoff (Centralblatt /. Balderiologie, x. 114) 
has bred from poisonous kinds of sturgeons two mobile short 
bacilli, microscopically similar to each other, one of which 
leaves gelatine solid, whilst the other liquefies it. Both 
proved infectious for rabbits, forming poisonous transforma- 
tion products in culture, and are regarded by their discoverer 
as the cause of the poisonous effect of preserved sturgeons. 
The symptoms are the same as those of meat and sausage 
poisoning. For the bibliography of the subject see Senkpiehl. 

Luminous fishes are to be considered like luminous meat. The red 
coloration of stock-fish, which has been often observed, and which 
depends on microbia, does not involve per se any poisonous property, 
but it makes the fish unattractive.

SECTION VIII. 
MILK. 1 

268. Milk is one of our most important articles of diet ; 
but there are few nutrients offered for sale so frequently 
and to such an extent in a state against which hygiene and 
national economy must alike protest. This state of affairs is 
favoured by the indifference of buyers, and is due to ignor- 
ance, convenience, or covetousness. 

The inspection of milk demands our very special attention 
for four reasons : 

1. Since milk serves as a nutriment at the sensitive age 

of childhood. 

2. Since the common deceptive manipulations reduce very 

considerably the nutritive value of this distinguished 
article of diet. 

3. As milk is an excellent nutrient medium for very many 

microbia, whence both poisoning and infections may 
be readily occasioned by its use. 

4. Because even the recent milk of diseased beasts, or 

of those improperly fed, may occasion poisoning or 
infection. 

A. Examination of Milk. 

I. Examination of the Properties which appeal 
to the Senses. 

269. Good cows' milk should be white with a slight 
yellowish cast, opaque and homogeneous, without flocks or 
clots, &c. The more opaque a milk the higher is generally 
its proportion of fat (see, however, 275). The taste and 

1 All that is said in the following pages refers to cows' milk.

54 MILK. 

smell a,re hard to describe, but universally known. Skimmed 
or watered milk inclines more to a bluish colour; a drop 
placed on the thumb-nail is more translucent than new 
milk, and is more inclined to run off. (Nail test.) 

By the growth of microphytes, and, it is said, by certain foods, milk 
often becomes strikingly yellow, red, or blue (see 297). If allowed to 
stand in a glass tapering downwards, there are deposited at the bottom 
particles of dirt derived from cow-dung, and in some cases slimy or 
tough, colourless or coloured, masses, which must be examined micro- 
scopically for pus, blood, epithelium, &c. 

Colostrum, 1 biestinys, the milk secreted a few days before and the 
first days after calving. It is yellowish, interspersed with flocks 
and ilocculi, insipid and slightly saline in taste. Immediately and 
for twenty-four hours after the birth the colostrum on ebullition 
coagulates in toto (very much globulins along with increased serum 
albumen). After some days Hakes of albumen separate out on ebulli- 
tion. The reaction, according to Pfeiffer, is alkaline, according to 
Fleischinann, generally acid : the proportion of lactose is usually very 
low. 

The examination of milk by taste and smell requires no 
special direction ; both these tests are undertaken with milk 
which has been gently heated. 

II. Microscopic Examination. 

270. The fat-globules of milk (from 19 to 17 fi in diam- 
eter) were formerly counted up, and their number was used 
for determining the value of the milk a troublesome and 
untrustworthy method. One cubic centimetre contains from 
691 to 2291 millions of fat-globules (Tayonaga-Soxhlet). 
In the colostrum the globules are strikingly unequal in size ; 
along with very small there occur very large globules, and 
in addition colostrum corpuscules are never wanting (from 
15 to 50 fji in diameter) which must be regarded as granu- 



1 To give a notion of the varying composition of colostrum, the following 
two analyses by Fleischmann are appended : 

Immediately after calving : fat, 3'4 ; total solids, 28'3 ; caseine, 4 - 8 ; 
albumen, 15'8 ; lactose, 2'5 ; ash, 1'8. 

One day after calving : fat, 4'0 ; total solids, 21 '3 ; caseine, 7 '3 ; albumen, 
75 ; lactose, 1*5 ; ash, 1. 

The specific gravity of colostrum is from 1/046 to TO 80.

lated epithelium-cells of the mammary-gland in the course 
of fatty degeneration (Fig. 99). 

The cow-dung collected in the tapering glass displays 
under the microscope vegetable tissue (parenchyma, prosen- 
chyma) and vessels of a yellow or yellowish-green (biliary) 
colour: starch granules can often be detected in the cells 
distinctly by the addition of iodine. Starch fraudulently 
added would also be detected by the microscope (starch-paste,

which is said to have occurred, is detected by a blue colora- 
tion if the quantity of iodised potassium iodide added is 
not too small) ; milk itself takes up a trace of iodine. 

Corpuscules of blood and pus are easily detected by the 
microscope ; the spectroscope likewise often does good service 
in the detection of blood. (For the detection of microbia see 
285.) 

III. Qualitative Composition of Milk. 

271. 1. Albumenoids. According to Hoppe-Seyler there 
occur in milk at least two albumenoids : 

a. Caseine precipitated from highly diluted milk by a little acetic 
acid and the introduction of C0 2 . According to E. Pfeiffer it 
may be obtained more conveniently and quite as accurately by 
adding dilute HC1 (2 per cent.) to milk diluted with only five 
parts of water. (The precipitate includes all the fat which must 
be removed by treatment with ether.) 

6. Serum albumen is precipitated by boiling the filtrate of a. 
In the filtrate of 6 there are still contained small quantities of albu- 
menoids, which may be precipitated by high concentration and the 
addition of tannin. The ferment of rennet precipitates especially 
caseine, whilst albumen remains in solution. 

Other methods of precipitation by means of salts, e.g., magnesium 
sulphate, yield other precipitates variously named. Practically little 
has been hitherto gained by these divisions. 



56 MILK. 

The practical hygienist for the present will therefore take 
up the position recently adopted by E. Pfeiffer and Duclaux, 
and regard all the albumenoids obtained by the precipitation 
of the albumenoids of milk as mere modifications of caseine. 

2. Fat. Butter-fat has a composition differing from that 
of all other animal and vegetable fats by its proportion of 
low (volatile) fatty acids. For particulars see Butter. 

3. Sugar. In the milk of all mammals (and almost ex- 
clusively there) is contained alone milk-sugar (lactose) 
C ]2 H 22 O n + H 9 O, a hard variety of sugar which grates under 
the teeth and tastes but slightly sweet. For its reduction 
see 217, and for its polarising action compare 30. By the 
action of the rnicrobia of lactic acid it readily yields fermen- 
tation-lactic acid ; witli yeast it ferments slowly and with 
difficulty. (See 92.) 

4. Among the constituents of the ash of milk, phosphoric acid, 
potassium, and calcium are prominent. According to Soldner 25 per- 
cent, of the phosphoric acid in the ash of milk are derived from 
caseine : all the sulphuric acid comes from the albumenoids. Calcium 
is, e.g., partly combined with caseine, but a considerable part, according 
to Soldner, is merely suspended in the milk as tricalcium phosphate. 

r>. Nitrates, nitrites, and sulphates are absent in pure milk. A little 
citric acid according to Soxhlet and Scheibe, from 17 to 2 yrm. per 
litre small quantities of urea, cholesterin, lecithin, and hypoxanthin 
arc, of no practical importance. 

( Concerning the products which appear on the decompo- 
sition of milk by the influence of different bacteria see 285. 

IV. Quantitative Chemical Examination of Milk. 

272. It is especially important to determine : 

1. The specific gravity. 

2. The total dry matter. 

3. The proportion of fat. 

4. The acidity. 

Of less importance, and rarely required for hygienic and 
market-police purposes, are : 

o. The determination of albumen, milk-sugar, and ash. 
All quantitative results are given in percentages by 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 57 

weight, i.e., x grm. substance in 100 grm. milk (not in 
100 cc.}. 

In every quantitative determination care must he taken : 

1. That before each sampling (especially for the market 
inspection) the milk is most thoroughly mixed by good 
stirring or shaking. The extreme tendency of the cream to 
separate out may otherwise lead very readily to false results. 

2. The milk must be examined very soon after it is drawn. 
If this is impossible, it must be set in ice in the meantime, 
attending to what is said below concerning contraction. 

3. In case of exact determinations of small quantities of 
milk (not exceeding 50 grm.\ the milk taken must not be 
measured, but weighed accurately, as it flows more or less 
completely from the pipette according to its proportion of fat. 

As evaporation easily occurs in weighing milk, the following indirect 
method is taken : We weigh, about from 30 to 50 cc. of milk and a 
glass rod in a beaker covered with a glass plate or in a stoppered 
weighing-glass, pour out about 10 cc. as estimated by the eye, along the 
glass rod for analysis, and find the remaining weight of the weighing- 
glass. The difference of the two weights shows the quantity of milk 
taken. 

1. DETERMINATION OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 

273. For this purpose we use a very fine arseometer, 
especially constructed for milk, and known as a lactodensi- 
meter, preferably such in which the figures representing the 
third decimal place of the specific gravity are at a distance 
of 8 to 10 mm. from each other, so that the fourth decimal 
may be read off. The ordinary Quevenne's milk-glass or 
hydrometer, where the figures are at the distance of 3 mm. 
from each other, is to be used only as a make-shift. All 
arseometers must be standardised by comparison with the 
Westphal balance. 

The milk-araeometers generally show the specific gravities 
only from 1-020 to 1-040. Only the figures 20 to 40 are 
written on the instrument, and we commonly speak (as in 
the case of urine), instead of a milk as of specific gravity 
1-0314, of one of 31 '4 degrees. The degrees, therefore, show 
by how many thousandth parts the milk is heavier than water. 



58 MILK. 

The most necessary precautions in determining the specific 
gravity of milk are as follows : 

1. The milk must never be weighed immediately after 
milking, since shortly after milking it rises not incon- 
siderably (from 0'8 to 1-5 degree). It is not certainly 
known upon what this depends perhaps upon a contraction 
of the milk globules from a subsequent contraction of the 
butter-fat. In any case the freshly drawn milk should be 
cooled for about six hours at a temperature of 5 (ice-closet), 
or at least be placed overnight in a cellar, or in the water of 
a Howing well, before it is weighed. 

Milk obtained in the market lias almost always stood long enough 
after milking to have reached its maximum density before it is brought 
into the laboratory and submitted to examination, for though milk 
reaches its greatest contraction more slowly at the temperature of a 
room than when placed in ice, it is generally completed in twelve to 
twenty-four hours. In doubtful cases the milk should be weighed 
again the next day, after prolonged standing in the ice-closet. 

2. The milk, before the determination of its specific gravity, 
should be free from froth. This is effected by pouring it in 
slowly along the sides of the hydrometer-jar, which should 
be so wide and high that the instrument may float without 
touching. The anuometer should be immersed slowly and 
cautiously, not allowing it to sink far above the correct 
graduation. When it has come to rest it is plunged at most 
1 deeper, and read off after it has adjusted itself. As the 
milk always ascends a little on the stem of the araeometer, 
in consequence of adhesion, the true horizontal level of the 
liquid should always be carefully read off. 

3. The specific gravity must never be taken without a 
simultaneous correct determination of the temperature of 
the milk, and in the interest of accuracy the milk should 
always be brought approximately to the temperature of 15 
by setting the vessel in cold or hot water ; all readings are 
reduced to this temperature. It is evident that the specific 
gravity of the milk gives at lower temperatures too high, 
and at higher temperatures too low, a value. For correction 
the Table XI. is employed. 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 59 

2. DETERMINATION OF TOTAL SOLIDS. 

274 According to E. Pfeiffer. We place a small plati- 
num capsule in a weighing-glass, pour in from 3 to 4 grm. 
of milk, and weigh again. After exposure to 100 in a 
drying-closet for eighteen to twenty-four hours, all the water 
is evaporated, and the capsule is weighed again a few times, 
until the weight has become constant. As Pfeiffer ascer- 
tained by check determinations, this method yields very good 
results, and the desiccated milk can further be used for the 
determination of ash ( 281). The practical milk-chemists, 
however, persist that a correct determination of dry matter 
can be effected only : by desiccation upon porous material, 
e.g. . 

According to Halenke and Moslinger (modified by Herz), we dry in 
the drying-closet, in a porcelain capsule of 10 cm. in diameter, about 
30 grm. of sand, previously ignited and extracted with ether, along with 
a glass rod, and weigh when cold. About 10 grm. of milk are poured 
in, the whole is quickly weighed again, the milk is distributed with the 
glass rod, and the capsule is placed upon a water-bath which is in brisk 
ebullition. The water evaporates on frequent stirring ; especially to- 
wards the end of the process care must be taken for the utmost possible 
comminution of the clots, which may readily inclose water. Any solid 
crusts which have been formed may be more easily rendered friable by 
slight moistening with water. After the water seems to be evaporated 
the capsule is still left for two hours on the water-bath, which is kept 
in full ebullition, stirring only at intervals ; the capsule is then wiped 
dry underneath, and allowed to cool in the desiccator ; two check 
determinations should exactly agree with each other, and not a grain 
of sand must be lost. 

According to the Adams method of determining fat, the total dry 
matter is ascertained simultaneously ( 277). This method may be 
particularly recommended. 

3. DETERMINATION OF FAT. 

A. APPKOXIMATE METHODS. 

275. For a long time the attempt was made in practice 
to make shift with inaccurate instruments for the determina- 
tion of fat, as their easy application was enticing. But since 

1 Professor J. A. Wanklyn insists, on the contrary, that "the employment 
of plaster of Paris or sand is to be avoided " (" Milk Analysis," p. ly). 



6o 



MILK. 



it has been shown that all these methods gave not even 
approximate but totally inaccurate values, and that under 
certain circumstances they failed entirely, they are no longer 
used by any chemist, and the physician will find it preferable 
not to employ them any longer. (See Vogel.) 

As such instruments are still frequently found in the hands of market 
inspectors, police officials, and of laymen, they must be briefly men- 
tioned. 

Above all, those apparatus must be mentioned which depend on the 
inaccurate assumption that the proportion of fat and the opacity of 
milk are exactly proportional, and which proceed from the fundamental 
notion of adding water to a milk until it is so far transparent that a 
writing or a mark can be distinguished through it. The percentage of 
fat is then to be concluded from the quantity of water which has to be 
added to a given volume of milk. Other kindred methods (e.g., Donne 
with his lactoscope) determined the thickness of the stratum of undi- 
luted milk through which the flame of a candle can be distinctly seen. 
Of the numerous instruments all constructed upon this supposition, 
one, the lactoscope of Feser (Fig. 100), has gradually 
superseded the others, in consequence of its cleanly and 
convenient manipulation ; I will therefore content my- 
self with describing it. 

In a wide transparent glass tube, #, slightly contracted 
below, there is sealed a small cylinder of opal glass, m, 
which is everywhere at the exact distance of 4'75 mm. 
from the external cylinder, and is graduated with black 
transverse lines. Into the glass cylinder, which is care- 
fully cleansed and dried, there are poured, by means of 
the accompanying pipette, 4 cc. of milk, and spring 
water is added (in portions of 5 to 10 cc.), shaking vigo- 
rously each time, until the degrees are distinctly visible 
by re He -ted light. The quantity of water which has 
been added, or the corresponding volume of fat, is then 
read off on the graduation of the lactoscope. 

Dietzsch has recently modified the instrument by 
placing only one mark on the outer glass cylinder. If 
to 4 cc. of milk water is then added up to this mark, the 
milk, if it contains more than 2*8 or 2 '9 per cent, of 
fat which Diet/sell takes as a minimum must be so 
opaque that the black marks cannot be recognised. If 
they can be counted, the market inspector hands over 
the sample to the chemist for closer examination. 

The use of Feser's apparatus is uncertain even for an 
experienced operator evidently as other circumstances than the mere 
proportion of fat may come into question. Thus, as Vogel mentions, 
Feser himself with his apparatus found in a milk 3} per cent, of fat, 
whilst Vogel by the gravimetric process found only l'G9 per cent., or

about one-half. The opacity of milk is greatly increased by boiling, 
owing to a change in the albuminous corpuscules. 

But even if there occur no particular difficulties, the apparatus must 
be pronounced little trustworthy. It presupposes, of course, uniform 
illumination, and a uniform judgment whether the marks are distinct 
or indistinct, &c. The black marks on the opal glass are in time 
washed away, so that more water must be added for their recognition. 

What has been said of the lactoscope holds good mutatis 
mutandis of the other optical methods. No one at present 
would venture in a law court to give an opinion on the 
proportion of fat in a milk in reliance upon an optical 
examination. 

Still more deceptive than the results of the optical method 
are those obtained with the cremometer. It was sought to 
ascertain the percentage of fat from the depth of the stratum 
of cream which separates out in a measuring cylinder when 
the milk is left at rest for twenty-four hours. But the 
cream separates out from the milk sometimes not at all, 
sometimes imperfectly, and often very slowly ; the cream is 
sometimes rich and at other times poor in fat. For parti- 
culars see Vogel and Herz. The manifold modifications of 
the simple cremometer are by no means improvements 
capable of making the apparatus useful for the purposes of 
the sanitary police. 1 

276. A process which stands at the limit of an accurate 
determination and valuation is that with the lactobuty- 
rometer, invented by Marchand, subsequently improved by 
Salleron and then by Tollens and Schmidt. 

Principle. The method depends on the idea of extracting 
the milk- fat from the liquid milk by means of ether, separat- 
ing the fat from its ethereal solution by alcohol, and calcu- 
lating the percentage of fat from the volume of fat thus 
separated. 

Execution. Into a glass tube holding 40 cc., and sealed at 
the bottom (Fig. 101), there are introduced 10 cc. of milk by 
means of a pipette, then 10 cc. of ether (of the specific gravity 

1 It is to be regretted that the lactometer is still recommended in manuals 
for medical officers of health. See Wankljn's "Milk Analysis," p. 8. Editor.

0-725 to 0-730 at 15) ; the tube is then stoppered with a 
soft cork well pressed, and well shaken; the cork is then 
cautiously eased and the shaking repeated until a perfectly 
homogeneous mixture is obtained. We 
then add 10 cc. of alcohol at 91 per 
cent, (specific gravity 0*8203), and the 
whole is again well shaken for a longer 
time (some minutes) until the clots of 
caseine formed are finely and uniformly 
divided. The tube, firmly closed, is then 
placed for at least a quarter of an hour 
in a tall, wide cylinder full of warm 
water at 48, when a clear yellowish 
layer of fat separates out at the surface 
of the liquid. Drops of fat which rise 
more sluggishly can be made to unite 
with the main mass by gentle tapping. 
When the operation is completed the 
ethereal fatty stratum (about 1 cc.) 
must rise sharply and distinctly above 
the remaining liquid. The apparatus 
is then placed for a time in water at 
20, when some portions of fat which were held back by the 
warmer liquid mixture separate themselves, and the cubic 
centimetres of fat liberated are read off. 

Various authors recommend the milk to be first shaken 
up, before adding the ether, with from three to five drops of 
acetic acid, or with one drop of soda-lye, in order that the fat 
may be more readily taken up by the ether.

The columns B show directly what percentage of fat the 
milk contains when the quantities of the ethereal fat solution 
are read off in columns A. 

The method gives generally not only approximate values 
but even very good results, but in many cases it fails us. If 
the milk contains less than 2*9 per cent., the method, accord- 
ing to Tollens and Schmidt themselves, is not quite trust- 
worthy (for skim-milk it is therefore generally useless) ; if it 
contains more than 3 '5 per cent, of fat we may, according to 
Fleischmann, obtain errors up to 1 per cent. Sometimes 
there occurs no separation at all of a fatty layer, or one 
which is too low by one-half. In spite of this undeni- 
able faulty side of the method, it is recommended where 
there is no balance and no Soxhlet apparatus available, 
especially if we have to do with the control of numerous 
kinds of milk presumably normal (e.g., in dairies for the 
control of contractors who supply milk). If a remarkable 
result is obtained with the method, one of the processes of the 
following section is to be used, but not much time is lost : 

The " lactocrit " of De Laval is a centrifugal apparatus, driven by 
steam, in which samples of milk warmed, and with the addition of 
a mixture of lactic acid and sulphuric acid, are made to revolve with 
extreme rapidity for three to four minutes ; the percentage of fat can 
then be read off at once. Suitable only for use on the large scale in 
dairies. 

B. ACCURATE METHODS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAT. 

277. 1. Gravimetric Determination of Fat. The propor- 
tion of fat is ascertained accurately by the following 
methods : 






64 MILK. 

1. The residue of the milk desiccated upon sand or 
gypsum l ( 274), after it has been finely pulverised, is put in 
a paper case, extracted with ether, and the fat obtained is 
weighed according to 214. 

Latterly, the Adams method, the absorption of the milk 
by paper spirals, is universally recommended as very good. 
Specially prepared filter-paper (exhausted with alcohol and 
ether) is here employed. Of this material a slip of 56 cc. in 
length and 6 cm. in breadth is coiled loosely into a spiral, 2 
held together by two rings of platinum wire ; the coil is 
then dried in the desiccating closet and weighed (). About 
o grin, of milk are weighed off in a small covered beaker, the 
spiral is allowed to absorb the milk all but traces, and 
weighed back into the residue of milk. The spiral is lifted 
out by the upper platinum ring, or by the twisted place which 
it has occupied, and dried on a porcelain capsule at 100 for 
one hour. The fat is then- extracted with ether in Soxhlct's 
apparatus and weighed ( /'). The extracted paper spiral is 
also weighed (e). Then e + f a is the dry substance 
present in the quantity of milk absorbed. 

The method of Adams constantly secures more advocates, 
and will completely supersede the tedious sand or gypsum 
method. The results agree excellently with those of 
Soxhlet's aru'ometric method, but are slightly higher (more 
correct than those of the gypsum method). The earlier 
objections against the Adams process, depending on the use 
of a material imperfectly extracted with alcohol and ether, 
are done away with. 

2. Eecently E. Pfeiffer has proved that by the careful 
execution of an older process (Hoppe Seyler's) fairly con- 
cordant values are obtained for the fat. As this method is 
simple and convenient it is here described in the author's 
words : 



1 For the determination of fat in skim milk gypsum is urgently advocated. 
35 grm. of the finest gypsum and 10 grm. of milk are dried upon the water- 
bath without stirring ; the dry mass obtained is weighed, ground very finely, 
and extracted. 

2 Schleicher and Schiill offer for sale a suitable paper in proper coils. 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 65 

About 10 grm. of milk are weighed, mixed with 40 cc. of 
distilled water, and there are added 3 or 4 cc. of a 2 per cent, 
hydrochloric acid (2 cc. of the pure concentrated hydrochloric 
acid with 100 cc. of water). The flocculent precipitate formed 
on stirring is immediately placed on a folded filter of 9 cm 
in diameter, which 
has been previously 
extracted with ether, 
slightly washed with 
water, and then dried 
in the desiccation 
closet from five to 
six hours. The dried 
filter is then bent 
together at the top 
and extracted with 
ether, according to 
214. The loss of 
weight after desicca- 
tion shows the pro- 
portion of fat. 

For the examination 
of human milk the me- 
thod of E. Pfeiffer is 
modified as follows : 
About 10 grm. of milk 
are weighed off as rapidly 
as possible in a small 
beaker, and mixed with 
about 10 cc. of absolute 
alcohol. On stirring 
there appears at once a 
very finely divided pre- 
cipitate, which is imme- 
diately placed upon a folded filter of 9 cm. in diameter, previously ex- 
tracted with ether and alcohol. The residue of the precipitate is very 
carefully rinsed out of the beaker with a portion of the filtrate, and the 
beaker itself finally cleansed out with a mixture of 10 cc. distilled water 
and 10 cc. absolute alcohol, using the caoutchouc scrubber, and the 
precipitate is then washed upon the filter with the same liquid. The 
funnel with the filter and precipitate is after washing placed imme-

metric Dteremination of Fat.

diately in the drying-closet, where it is allowed to remain for three to 
four hours. Then follows extraction in Soxhlet's apparatus. 

If a determination of albumen in the milk is made accord- 
ing to Ritthausen ( 279), the fat may be determined by ex- 
tracting the copper precipitate, a manipulation which must 
in any case be carried out for determining the albumen. 

A series of my own determinations, with hydrochloric acid 
as well as Ritthausen's precipitation, have afforded me accu- 
rate results, so easily obtained that I may recommend the 
method especially for any one who works without extensive 
apparatus. 

2. The arccomctric method of determining the fat according 
to Soxhlet. 

278. Along witli the chemical methods above described, 
a physical process, devised by Soxhlet, and elaborated in its 
minutest details, has latterly met with universal accept- 
ance. It is now regarded as the best method for the deter- 
mination of fat, but it unfortunately requires a somewhat 
costly apparatus. 

On account of the advantages of the method, and of the 
rapidity with which the apparatus admits of the successive 
completion of very many determinations of fat, it is indispens- 
able for every one who performs many examinations of milk. 
A scrupulously accurate observance of what seem to be the 
most unimportant details of the instructions is necessary for 
correct work, especially as regards the manner of shaking 
and the maintenance of the temperature. 

Principle. The principle is that ether, if mixed in certain 
quantities with milk and potassa-lye, dissolves all the fat of 
the milk, and that at a given temperature a perfectly definite 
specific weight corresponds to every percentage of fat in the 
ethereal solution of fat. 

For the performance of the process there are required (verbatim 
according to Soxhlet) : 

1. The apparatus as figured with the three accompanying tubes for 
measuring milk, potassa-lye, and ether, which can be fixed on the 
stand of the apparatus, and several -shaking-flask? (a). 






QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 67 

2. Potassa-lye of specific gravity T26 to 1*27. 

3. Washed ether (which has been shaken up with distilled water). 

4. Ordinary ether. 

5. A vessel of the capacity of at least 4 litres, with water which must 

be brought to the temperature of 17 or 18. For the simul- 
taneous execution of several experiments the vessel must be 
correspondingly large. If the room is warm 17 is taken as the 
initial temperature, if cooler, 18. 

The execution of the process : Measure off 200 cc. of the milk, which 
must have been thoroughly mixed and cooled (or warmed) to 17^ 
(17 or 18), by sucking the largest pipette full up to the mark ; the con- 
tents of the measuring-tube are allowed to flow into one of the shaking- 
bottles (a) of the capacity of 300 cc., and the measuring- tube is finally 
emptied by blowing into it. 

In a similar manner 10 cc. of potassa-lye are measured off with the 
smallest pipette, shaking well up, and adding 60 cc. of washed ether 
which has been measured off in the corresponding pipette. The ether, 
when measured in, should have a temperature of 16'5 to 18'5 (normally 
17'5). After the flask has been well closed with a cork or a caoutchouc 
stopper it is shaken up violently for half a minute, placed in the vessel 
with water at 17 to 18, and during a quarter of an hour it is very 
gently shaken every half minute, giving each time three or four shocks 
in a vertical direction. After standing quietly for a quarter of an 
hour longer, a clear layer will have collected in the upper contracted 
part of the bottle. The collection and clarification of this layer is 
accelerated if towards the end of the time a slight rotatory movement 
is given to the contents of the bottle. It is indifferent whether the 
entire solution of the fat has collected on the surface or only a portion, 
if it is large enough to allow the hydrometer to float. The solution 
must be perfectly clear. In milk very rich in fat (4^ to 5 per cent.), 
the separation takes a longer time than that mentioned above some- 
times, exceptionally, from one to two hours. In such cases, and indeed 
generally, if a sufficiently large water-vessel is at hand, it is judicious 
to lay the bottles which must be well corked horizontally. 

The apparatus for the determination of specific gravity, shown in 
Fig. 102, is arranged as follows : 

The stand carries, by means of displaceable nuts, a support for the 
cooling- tube A, to the efflux-tubes of which are fixed short caoutchouc 
pipes. The support of the cooling-tube can rotate on its perpendicular 
axis, so that it may be placed in a horizontal position. A glass tube, B 
2 mm. wider than the float of the araeometer, is fixed centrically in the 
condensing-tube. In order to prevent the upper part from being closed 
by the araeometer, or to prevent the latter from wedging fast, there are 
at the lower part of B three points projecting inwards. The upper, 
open end must be closed with a cork. 

The araeometer G has on the scale of its stem the degrees 66 to 43, 
which at 17^ C. correspond to the specific gravities 0'766 to 0'743. 

In the float of the araeometer there is a thermometer, graduated in 



68 MILK. 

fifths of a degree Centigrade, by means of which one-tenth of a degree 
can be read off. 

For use, the caoutchouc pipe of the lower lateral outflow -tube, 6, on 
the cooling-tube, is plunged into the vessel of water, suction is applied 
at the upper flexible pipe until the intermediate space of the cooler is 
filled with water, and the whole is closed by uniting the ends of both 
flexible pipes by means of a small glass tube. The stopper a of the 
.shaking bottle is removed, in its place is fixed the cork D, through the 
two apertures of which there pass elbow-tubes of different lengths, the 
longer-limbed one, s, being pushed down so far that its end almost 
plunges into the layer of ether-fat. After the small caoutchouc bag has 
been fitted on the shorter elbow-tube, and the cork in the tube B has 
been eased, the pinch-cock q is opened, and the caoutchouc ball E is 
pressed as gently as possible. The clear solution of fat rises into the 
araeometer tube and lifts the araeometer. When the latter floats, the 
pinchcock is closed, and the cock fixed in the araeometer tube to prevent 
the ether from evaporating. The operator waits for one or two minutes, 
until the temperature has become equalised, and the height of the scale 
is read off, but not until the araeometer has been brought into the 
middle of the liquid, which is easily effected by inclining the elbow- 
tube on its movable holder, and turning the screw at the foot of the 
stand. 

As the specific gravity is reduced by a rise of temperature and is 
raised by a lower temperature, the temperature of the ethereal fat- 
solutioii must be taken into account in determining the specific gravity 
of the ethereal fat solution. We therefore, shortly before or after the 
reading of the araeometer, take the temperature of the liquid to one- 
tenth of a degree on the thermometer in the araeometer. If the tem- 
perature was exactly 17 '5, the indication of the araeometer is at once 
available, otherwise the specific gravity read off must be reduced to the 
temperature of 17'5. For every degree which the thermometer indi- 
cates above 17 '5 a degree must be added to the figure read off on the 
araeometer, and for every degree which it shows less than 17 '5 a degree 
must be deducted ; but the deviation from the mean temperature 17-5 
should not exceed 1. From the specific weight found for 17'5 the 
proportion of fat may be found in percentages by weight on reference 
to Table XII. 

Example. Specific, gravity of the ethereal solution of fat at 17'0 C = 
57'0 ; therefore at 17*5 = 57'0 - 0'5 = 56'5. To this specific gravity 
the corresponding proportion of fat is 3 '69 per cent. 

In order, after the completion of an investigation, to have the appa- 
ratus ready for the next determination, the cock of the shaking- 
bottle is eased, and the solution of fat is allowed to flow back into it. 
The araeometer-tube B is then filled with ordinary ether, and this also 
is allowed to flow off. If a powerful current of air is driven through 
the entire apparatus by means of a blast, it is quickly obtained clean 
and dry. In case of need it is again rinsed out with ether.

4. DETERMINATION OF THE ALBUMENOIDS. 

279. In general a determination of nitrogen by the Kjeldahl 
process (213) is sufficient for the estimation of the albumenoids ; they 
are rarely determined as such. We shall therefore describe merely the 
excellent method proposed by Ritthausen. We prepare : 1. Solution 
of copper sulphate, 34*64 crystalline copper sulphate per litre, i.e., the 
stock-liquid of Fehling's solution ( 215) diluted with an equal volume 
of water. 2. Soda-lye, 15 grm. caustic soda per litre. Specific gravity 
1-0180. 

We weigh out 10 grm. of milk, add 100 cc. of water and exactly 15 cc. 
of solution of copper sulphate, and stir, adding then 7 cc. soda-lye and 
stirring again. Almost always there appears in a few moments a light- 
blue, finely flocculent precipitate, which quickly subsides, and over it 
a clear, colourless, neutral liquid, free from copper and albumen. The 
precipitate is collected on a weighed folded filter, dried, weighed again, 
extracted with ether in Soxhlet's apparatus (determination of fat by 
observing the decrease of weight). On weighing : filter + albumen + 
copper hydroxide (the copper on the filter is in this state) = A , the filter 
alone = F. Then A - F = 0'2026 albumen, for the hydrated copper 
oxide from 15 cc. of solution of copper sulphate weighs 0'2026. For 
very accurate determination there are to be deducted, according to 
Pfeiffer, from 16 to 19 mgrm. for constituents of the ash of milk which 
have been simultaneously precipitated. 

If, on working carefully according to the above directions, there 
appears, instead of the light-blue, finely flocculent precipitate, a dark- 
blue sediment of large flocks, the reaction must be examined. If alka- 
line, it is very cautiously diluted with highly dilute hydrochloric acid ; 
if acid, the above soda-lye is added drop by drop. For further details 
see Pfeiffer. 

On the fractionated precipitation of the albumenoids compare 271. 



5. DETERMINATION OF LACTOSE. 

280. The filtrate from Ritthausen's precipitation of albumen, which 
is free from albumen, fat, and copper, is diluted to 400 cc., and treated 
according to 279. 



6. DETERMINATION OF ASH. 

281. The residue from the determination of solids effected in a 
platinum capsule on C. Pfeiffer's method is conducted according to the 
rules given in 274. An addition of sodium carbonate or bicarbonate 
cannot be distinctly detected gravimetrically, as 1 grm. of soda-ash per 
litre gives milk an alkaline taste, although the ash is increased only 
from 075 to 0'85 per cent. The ash of pure milk is very faintly alka- 
line, but that of milk to which ordinary soda or bicarbonate has bet n 



70 MILK. 

added has a very strong alkaline reaction. In incinerating milk it 
is very important to avoid an excessive heat. 

The detection of an addition of soda is more practically effected as 
according to 283 than in the ash. 

Heavy metals are sought for according to Section XVIII. 



7. DETERMINATION OF THE REACTION AND THE 
ACIDITY OF MILK. 

282. Milk freshly drawn from the udder has always an 
arnphoteric reaction, i.e., it can both redden blue litmus 
paper and turn reddened paper blue. But here a very 
sensitive pale neutral litmus paper is required. This pro- 
perty is due to the presence of mono-potassium phosphate 
(H. 2 KP0 4 ) with an acid reaction, along with (HK. 2 P0 4 ) with 
a faintly alkaline reaction with litmus. 

With phenolphthaleine which shows a violet colour only 
with basic substances or an excess of alkali, milk behaves 
like an acid, and we may determine the degree of acidity by 
the volume of soda-lye which must be added to produce a 
violet colour. On standing the acidity increases by the 
formation of lactic acid, and accordingly the increased con- 
sumption of soda-lye. Two methods of titration have been 
proposed. 

Method of Soxhlct and Henkcl. 50 cc. of milk which may 
be measured -f- 2 cc. of an alcoholic solution of 2 per cent, 
solution of phenolphthaleine are titrated with one-fourth 
normal soda-lye. For 100 cc. of fresh milk there were 
generally consumed 7 cc. of this soda-lye for the production 
of a faint rose-colour. At Wiirzburg we generally found for 
fresh market-milk from 9 to 97 cc. If comparable values 
are to be obtained the milk must not be diluted with water, 
as in this case (according to Soldner) less lye is consumed 
for the same quantity of milk for the production of a rose- 
colour. 

Plant (Archiv f. Hyyienc, xi.), according to a very careful 
investigation, containing numerous valuable details, always 
mixes 25 cc.. of milk and 1 cc. of Soxhlet's solution of 
phenolphthaleine and titrates with baryta-water, of which 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 71 

1 cc. = 5 mgrm, S0 3 . On using baryta- water he always has 
rather higher acidities than with soda-lye, and more accurate 
final reactions, by means of which, e.g., he was able to 
demonstrate a distinctly reduced acidity in fresh milk after 
a short ebullition, in consequence of the escape of carbonic 
acid. He generally found from 85 to 95 mgrm. of acid 
(calculated as S0 3 ) in 100 cc. of fresh milk, but after boiling 
about 10 mgrm. less. On standing the C0 2 which has been 
absorbed slowly escapes, 

E. Pfeiffer proposes to dilute 10 cc. of milk (it is here 
sufficient to measure) with 40 cc. of water, adding a few drops 
of a concentrated solution of phenolphthaleine in alcohol at 
50 per cent., and dropping in cautiously decinormal soda- 
lye until a pale rose-colour appears. Or 0'8 to 0*9 cc. of 
one-fourth normal soda for fresh milk. (See Dissertation, by 
J. Clauss, Bakterioloy. Untersuch. der Milch in Wurzburg, &c., 
1889.) 

According to our experiments for 100 cc. of undiluted 
milk, there is required about twelve times as much soda-lye 
as for 10 diluted to 50 cc. Titration after dilution, according 
to Pfeiffer, is more pleasant, as the change of colour is more 
prompt and the consumption of milk smaller. But since 
Plaut also has carried out all his numerous analyses accord- 
ing ,to Soxhlet's method, the choice of this latter process is to 
be recommended. 

8. DETECTION OF PRESERVATIVE AGENTS AND 
OTHER CHEMICALS ADDED. 

283. The true preservative agents (benzoic acid, salicylic 
acid, boric acid) are with us rarely added to milk. Their 
detection is treated of in 226. Salicylic acid, if added 
rather freely to milk, may be detected by a slight addition 
of ferric chloride. An especially prominent part is played 
by sodium carbonate and bicarbonate in improving milk, 
although both these additions do not prevent the formation 
of acid, but merely hinder such acid from coagulating the 
milk. The neutralisation of the acids formed even promo t< s 



72 MILK. 

the production of a fresh supply. The detection of any 
appreciable quantity of soda is easy and distinct. 

Lazarus (Zeit. f. Hygiene, viii.) showed that heating for 
one or two hours to 100 is sufficient as a preliminary test. 
Milk with alkaline additions (soda, sodium bicarbonate, lime, 
borax) takes a brown or brownish-red colour; the colour 
taken by unsophisticated milk is at most very slight. 

E. Schmidt's Method. 10 cc. of the milk in question are 
mixed with 10 cc. of alcohol, and with a few drops of a 1 per 
cent, solution of rosolic acid. Pure milk assumes merely a 
brownish-yellow colour, whilst milk containing sodium car- 
bonate or bicarbonate appears more or less of a rose-red 
colour. An addition of 01 per cent, of sodium bicarbonate 
can be detected in this manner with great distinctness if the 
same test is simultaneously applied for comparison with 
normal milk. Phenolphthaleine is not applicable for this 
purpose. 

For a quantitative determination of the bicarbonate added 
the method of Fade is greatly recommended, and may be 
consulted in the Chemikcr Zcitung, 1889. Repertoriuni, 228. 

9. CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF CURDLED MILK 1 

284. It may occur that milk arrives in the laboratory 
which has curdled in transit. In this case we seek to 
procure a fresh sample ; the curdled milk is well shaken up 
in the bottle, a part of it is poured upon a filter, and in the 
filtrate (milk-serum) the specific gravity is determined 
( 20) ; it should not fall below T027. (Compare Raduliseu. 
Chemikcr Zcituiig, 1890, No. 50.) To the residue in the 
bottle there is added some concentrated ammonia until it 
slightly predominates ; the bottle is shaken again, and its 
contents, the total solids and the fat, are determined gravi- 
metrically, taking into consideration the possible presence of 
lactic acid in the weighed fat. The filtered serum, after the 
determination of its specific gravity, is tested for metals, 



1 For some remarks on the examination of milk for poisons, see 297. 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 73 

which may have been introduced on standing in metal vessels 
or in such as are badly glazed ( 297). 



10. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK. 

285. Milk from a healthy cow is secreted free from 
microbia ; but microbia always find their way into the milk 
from the surface of the udder, from the hands of the milker, 
from particles of dung, from the milk-cans which are never 
free from microbia, and, finally, from the air of the cow- 
house, which very rapidly multiply if the milk is not at once 
exposed to very low temperatures. 

Recently Leopold Schulz, working in my laboratory, has 
observed that the residues of milk in the excretory ducts of 
the udder present one of the most important sources of infec- 
tion for milk. Fractionated milking shows a rapid decrease 
of the number of microbia in the portions successively 
drawn : e.g., the first 300 cc. contained per cubic centimetre 
75,000 microbia, an intermediate portion 10,000, whilst the 
last portion was sterile. If a milk is diluted with water a 
crop of bacteria is thus obtained. 

The method of examination is that customary for liquids. 
Smear-preparations on cover-glasses may be splendidly dyed, 
according to Arens (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie,*.) by placing 
the dried and fl.ambe' cover-glasses in a small capsule con- 
taining 5 cc. chloroform and 1 cc. of a saturated alcoholic 
solution of methylene blue. After five minutes the chloro- 
form is allowed to run off and evaporate, the glasses are rinsed 
with water, and there is thus obtained an isolated coloration 
of the bacteria with the ground at most of a pale blue. 

More important is the examination by cultivation; on 
account of the great number of micro-organisms plentiful 
dilution is necessary, and agar should be used for the 
plates. In cases of new milk 5 cc. of milk should be first 
added to 100 cc. of sterilised water, and of this again 1 cc. 
to 100 cc. of sterilised water, and plates prepared from the 
first and second dilution with 0*5 and 1-0 cc. The number 
of microbia of the plate multiplied by 2121 gives the number 



L 



74 MILK. 

of microbia in 1 cc. Milk which has been exposed for somtf 
time .to a higher temperature must be diluted from ten 
to fifty times more strongly. If the several kinds have to 
be isolated from the milk, a still greater dilution may be 
necessary. 

By this method Clauss, in my laboratory, found in new 
Wurzburg milk, bought at 8 A.M. on a winter morning, from 
the dairymen, or from the peasants who supply milk, and 
preserved in a sterilised vessel for at most thirty minutes to 
one hour before a window secured with wadding, from 1*2 to 
2 '3 million schizomycetes (on one occasion only as few as 
220,000) ; Hohenkamp found in summer 1*9 to 7'2 millions. 
If the milk is exposed to a temperature of about 25 the 
number of microbia increases in twenty-four hours from 
1 to 2000 times, at 10 about 20 times; at temperatures a 
little above there ensues an unimportant increase ; tem- 
perature below diminishes the number of microbia to 
two-thirds (Clauss). 

The species commonly found in milk are : Bacillus acidi lactici 
( 84), Bacillus butyricus (Hiippe) ; Clauss found regularly at Wlirzburg 
two white cocci which do not liquefy gelatine Fluorcscens liquefaciens, 
and a " fan-bacillus " resembling the bacillus of lactic acid. One kind 
of coccus left the reaction of milk unaltered, the other occasioned a 
slight formation of acid ; whilst the bacilli of lactic acid, Fluorescent 
and the fan-bacilli, produce acid of about equal strength. Compare 
Leopold Schulz (Dissertation, Wurzburg, 1891), who obtained somewhat 
discrepant results. Grotenfeld describes also an anaerobic Streptococcus 
which produces lactic acid. 

LoelHer examined milk which had been slightly boiled and stop- 
pered with wadding, but had gradually passed into decomposition. 
He found purely sporiferous bacilli which attacked and peptonised 
albumen, and gave rise to an alkaline reaction, among which were 
Bacillus me*cntericus vulgatus and liodermos (^ 84). 

Blue milk contains Bacillus cyanocienus ( 84), red milk Bacillus 
prodigiosus, or the bacillus of red milk ( 84), or the quite recently 
discovered Sarcina rosea (Cent./. Bakttrwlogie, vi. 596). Yellow milk 
is produced by Bacillus synxanthus (Fliigge, MikroorganismeH) p. 290). 
Milk is rendered slimy and capable of being drawn into threads by a 
short, thick bacillus, which has been studied by Schinidt-Muhlheim and 
Loetner, and which is inclined to resolve itself into coccus-like segments. 
The slime seems in part to be a gummy carbohydrate formed from 
milk-sugar by the activity of microbia, but it consists in part of the 
metamorphosed bacterial protoplasm. More recent researches show, 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 75 

moreover, that various micro-organisms render milk stringy ; thus 
micrococciis occasion "die lange \\'ei" in Holland (Milc/tzeitung, 1889, 
pp. 421, 955), whilst Adametz describes a Bacillus lactis viscoscvs 
(Milc/izeitung, 1889, p. 941 ; CentralUatt f. Bakteriologie, vii., viii., ix.). 
In his latest investigations (quoted CentralUatt /. Baltieriologie, ix. 
p. 698) Adametz already enumerates eleven species which render milk 
stringy ; a part of them, however, may be mutually identical. The 
subject of the decomposition of milk by scliizomycetes and other organ- 
isms is being very carefully studied, and many new results may be 
expected. 

Numerous inicrobia communicate a bitter taste to milk, as we may 
easily convince ourselves by tasting old milk-cultures of different bac- 
teria. This is especially the case among three microbia which have not 
hitherto been described, among which are a coccus, a bacillus, and the 
Proteus rulgaris (CentralUatt f. Bakteriologie, ix. 653). 

All these micro-organisms find their way into the milk only after 
milking. Under certain circumstances pathogenic microbia (species 
producing typhus, cholera, suppuration, &c.) may be present in milk, 
and may increase in it to a certain extent (see 300). 

The milk of diseased animals may contain a series of pathogenic 
organisms, especially the bacilli of tubercle, cocci producing suppuration, 
&c. The detection of tubercle bacilli by staining generally miscarries ; 
it is much more certain to inject from 10 to 15 cc. of the milk into the 
peritoneal cavity of a guinea-pig. The milk must be as fresh as pos- 
sible. About four weeks after the injection the animals are killed, 
when there appears the characteristic type of tuberculosis of the peri- 
toneum. Concerning Monilia Candida see 91 ; it may be readily 
detected by plate-cultures. 

11. DETERMINATION OF DIET IN MILK. 

Renk has proposed the following simple practical method 
(Munchner. Med. Woclienschrift, 1890, Nos. 38 and 3). The 
milk in question is well stirred up or shaken, and 1 litre is 
poured into an ordinary glass mixing cylinder. After two 
hours the dirt will have been deposited. The milk is slowly 
drawn off through a syphon of glass and caoutchouc down to 
about 30 cc., without stirring up the sediment. The glass is 
then filled up with spring water to 1 litre, and the sedimen- 
tation and syphoning are repeated until the residue lies in 
perfectly clear water. It is then collected upon a dried and 
weighed filter, which is weighed again after repeated drying.

recalculate it as recent cow-dung we must remember that 
the latter never contains more than 20 per cent, of dry sub-

12. ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COAGULATION 
OF MILK AND THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS. 

286. Milk of medium keeping properties (i.e., of medium 
impurity at a normal composition), coagulates, according to 
Soxhlet, at 35 in 19 hours, at 30 in 21 hours, at 25 in 29 
hours, at 20 in 48 hours, at 17-1- in 63 hours, at 15 in 88 
hours, at 10 in 198 hours. 

Whilst 100 cc. of milk freshly purchased from the dealers 
required at "Wurzburg, according to Soxhlet, about 9-5 cc. of 
one-fourth normal soda-lye for neutralisation, milk at the 
beginning of coagulation required 30 cc. ; if it had passed 
into gelatinous coagulation, about 34 cc. ; and if it had be- 
come curdy, 37 to 43 '8 cc. of the same one-fourth normal 
soda-lye. 

The degree of acidity in milk (the most convenient scale 
for decomposition), if it has been at once cooled, remains for 
some time evidently constant (incubation-stage, according to 
Soxhlet); at 10, milk of medium keeping property remains 
from 52 to 72 hours without perceptible change in the 
acidity ; at 15, 36 hours ; and at 35, from 3 to 8 hours. 

The time of incubation evidently means that the percep- 
tible action of the schizomycetes begins only when they have 
sufficiently multiplied, which at different temperatures re- 



QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 77 

quires different lengths of time. If to freshly drawn milk 
we add small quantities of sour milk rich in bacteria, the 
incubation and the time of coagulation are much abridged. 

The chief cause of the coagulation of milk is the formation 
of lactic acid ( 285). 

Coagulation is produced, according to Segelke, by O55 to 
0'60 per cent, of free lactic acid at the temperature of a 
dwelling-room, and by 0'20 per cent, not below the boiling- 
point. 

The utmost cleanliness in milking, immediate and rapid 
cooling, and preservation at a low temperature, are conse- 
quently the fundamental conditions for a rational preserva- 
tion of milk. 

Methods of examining milk may here be mentioned which have been 
devised for cheese-factories, but certainly admit of a further applica- 
tion. (See Herz, Kuhmilch.) 

1. Schatzmanri's Fermentation Test. Portions of milk of 100 cc. each, 
in sterilised glass jars with porcelain covers, are placed in a water-bath 
at 40. At the expiry of six 'and nine hours respectively, milk must 
give no signs of fermentation, coagulation, &c. If coagulation appears 
at the expiry of twelve hours, the milk is to be regarded as suspicious. 

2. Schatzmann's Caseine Test. If 100 cc. of milk are mixed with 2 cc. 
of a solution of rennet of a known concentration (1 tablet of rennet in 
500 cc. of water), the milk, in a water-bath at 35, coagulates not sooner 
than in ten and not later than in twenty minutes. Colostrum and 
milk turning sour curdle in seven to eight minutes, saline milk later 
or not at all, the milk of feverish beasts slowly. In inflammation of 
the udder (mastitis), the coagulurn is flocculent, not compact, &c. 

From the above two methods Diethelm has combined a third, espe- 
cially useful in the manufacture of cheese, but less so in hygiene 
(Cheese-fermentation test). 

13. DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNBOILED AND BOILED 

MILK. 

287. 1. Unboiled milk turns tincture of guaiacum blue, 
boiled milk does not. According to Arnold, this depends on 
the presence of ozone. 

2. On boiling milk, there is, according to Schreiner, an 
escape of sulphuretted hydrogen. Boiled milk contains none. 
The smell and taste are perceptibly modified by boiling. 

3. Before boiling (according to Schreiner), milk requires 



78 MILK. 

for coagulation 10 to 12 per cent, more of sulphuric acid at 
O'l to 0'2 per cent., than after. 

4. Boiling increases the opacity of milk very considerably, 
evidently by a change in the aggregation of the swollen and 
dissolved albumenoids. This also occasions the formation of 
a film on boiling. 

APPENDIX TO SECTION A. EXAMINATION OF MILK. 

288. The Examination of Milk by the Market 

Inspectors. In order to facilitate the control of milk, 
in almost all towns police officers or especial market 
inspectors are entrusted with a preliminary examination. 
These persons are instructed to examine the milk of the 
dairymen and milk-dealers at irregular intervals with the 
Quevenne araeometer (milk-glass), and, if needful, with 
Feser's or Dietzsch's lactoscope, with which instruments 
they are supplied. If the araeometer is used, the milk must 
be well stirred up in the sale-can, which must be properly 
marked, poured into a suitable glass-cylinder (hydrometer- 
jar, eprouvette), and the temperature read off according to 
the Centigrade scale. For every degree of temperature above 
15 C., O2 must be added to the reading of the araeometer; 
for each degree below 15 C., 0*2 must be subtracted, as 
tables of corrections scarcely come into the hands of the 
police. If the market inspector finds new milk marking 
below 30 or above 34, skim milk below 33, or milk from 
a centrifugal machine below 33*5, the milk is to be charac- 
terised as suspicious ; from -J to -J litre are to be filled into a 
clean dry bottle, closed with a clean new cork, the projecting 
end of which is cut off, and the bottle is at once sealed up 
and sent to the public analyst. A ticket is attached with 
the following particulars : Date (day and hour), the degree 
of the lactodensimeter read off, the temperature observed, 
the number of the lactodensimeter (the correction table for 
which is kept by the analyst), any observations made as to 
abnormal appearance, odour, or taste of the milk ; finally, the 
name and address of the vendor, along with his statements 
concerning its source, time of milking, state of health of the 



COMPOSITION AND FLUCTUATIONS OF MILK. 79 

cows, their time of feeding, and the supposed cause of the 
inferior condition of the milk. 

Where the market inspectors are entrusted also with lacto- 
scopes, they must, in cases where a watery appearance, along 
with a normal specific gravity, give ground for suspecting a 
combined sophistication, make the attempt to arrive at the 
truth by the optical method (the minimum of fat required 
varies in different places from 2*5 to 3 per cent.). But it 
is always well for the analyst to examine every sample of 
milk which appears suspicious to an experienced market 
inspector rather than to trouble the police with methods of 
testing the untrustworthiness of which has been long ago 
demonstrated. From time to time the milk of all the dealers 
and peasants should be chemically examined. 

B. Normal Composition of Milk, and its 
Fluctuations owing to the Breed of the 
Cattle, the Food, &c. 

289. Milk as obtained by completely draining the udder 
of a cow is called new milk (full milk, entire milk) ; in 
general the new milk of several cows comes to market mixed 
as market milk, in which the individual differences of the 
milk of the several cows are compensated. According to the 
market regulations of most German towns, new milk must 
be sold in tin vessels distinctly marked V.M. or M. ; in like 
manner, milk which before sale has been skimmed to obtain 
the cream must be marked as skimmed milk (A.M.), whilst 
milk almost entirely deprived of cream in a centrifugal 
machine is marked as centrifugalised milk or "whizzed" milk. 

The composition of new milk is :

The specific gravity at 15 is from T029 to 1*034. 

It must in general be pointed out that the quantity of 
milk yielded by a cow, and its proportion of total solids and 
of fat, vary often in opposite proportions. It is certain, how- 
ever, that the Dutch cows, which produce an abundance of 
milk, yield a much more watery milk (containing often only 
2J per cent, of fat) than other races which yield smaller 
quantities of rnilk. The dry substance free from fat which 
varies only from 7 '8 to 10 -2 per cent., fluctuates relatively 
less than the fat 2 - 5 to 4*5 per cent. In every district the 
analyst should collect observations on the average composi- 
tion of milk for the several months ; mean values for exten- 
sive districts or entire counties can serve only for arriving at 
a correct opinion. 

Skim milk (milk deprived of cream) is always commenc- 
ing to turn sour, as from twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
have to elapse before it is skimmed. The proportion of fat 
varies greatly ; extreme figures cannot be given ; the specific 
gravity amounts to from T032 to 1*033 and more, unless it 
has been simultaneously watered. 

Centrifugalised milk, according to Fleischmann and 
Dietzsch, contains about from 0*2 to 0*6 per cent, of fat, and 
has a specific gravity of 1'0335 to 1*03G. 

Half-milk is unfortunately allowed to be sold in many 
places, e.fj.y Berlin, Zurich ; it consists of skimmed evening 
milk and new morning milk, or of milk which has been 
partially freed from cream. Its sale ought to be prohibited, 
since it creates a sort of milk not easily controlled, and of a 
condition not easily definable. 

290. Along with the above-mentioned differences de- 
pending on race, there occur variations in the composition of 
milk due to a series of influences hard to estimate. For 
conditions affecting the odour and the taste, see 297. 

1. The food exerts an influence if the cows are in- 
duced to take a very watery food not accompanied with 
sufficient dry substances, as distillers' refuse, 1 beetroot 

1 Schlempe is a name given to distillers' waste, varying according as grain, 
potatoes, or beet-root serve as the raw material. It consists of water (90 per 



COMPOSITION AND FLUCTUATIONS OF MILK. Si 

cuttings, 1 or doses of salt to create thirst. The milk then 
becomes very abundant, but it is as if watered in the body 
of the cow, and is simultaneously poorer in fat and in other 
solids. Some days generally elapse before the full effects of 
such a change of diet appear; they are rarely recognised 
before one or two days. Small changes in the food are often 
for a considerable time without important influence. On 
grazing in pastures the milk is rapidly rendered richer in 
fat than during stall feeding. 

As for the different kinds of forage the following points are to be con- 
sidered : Every forage in a mouldy, ptitrescent, or even in an acid 
fermenting condition is injurious both to the cow and the milk. 
Hay (especially clover hay), green fodder from clover fields or good 
meadows, and all kinds of grain, are to be regarded as good. Mangolds, 
boiled potatoes, fresh or freshly dried brewers' grains, moderate quanti- 
ties of malt sprouts, are also rational food. Raw potatoes, the leaves of 
potatoes, fruit and residues of fruit, the leaves, &c., of beets, and sour- 
whey must be rejected. (According to the conditions of the Milk- 
suppliers' Association in the Algau.) 

The question of feeding with distillery waste, &c., is answered by 
Konig as follows : The residues from the starch manufacture and from 
treacle 2 are an unwholesome fodder, whether fresh or dried. Fresh 
grain and potato-waste, not sour, and fresh dried, are admissible, but 
milch-cows should not receive more than 20 litres of this fresh waste 
daily, otherwise the milk will be too watery and will occasion diarrhoea 
in children. 

A certain chemical proof of the use of these substances can scarcely 
be produced. Smell and taste, an occasionally abnormal proportion of 
water, or its disagreement with the consumer, will furnish the experi- 
enced observer with a clue. 

2. Moderate viork of cows has no influence upon the milk. 
Very severe labour may cause the production of a quite 
abnormal milk containing little fat and dry matter but an 
increase of mineral substance. 

3. The manner of milking is of great importance for the 
quality of the milk. In the udder of cows a separation of 
cream takes place exactly as in a vessel. Hence the portions 

cent. ), cellulose, and albumerioid substances, with variable small quantities of 
unfermented starch or sugar.

facture.

of milk first drawn are poor in fat, and the last portions rich 
in fat. Schmidt-Miihlheim found in the first 500 cc. drawn 
from different cows 0'8, 0*6, 0*8, 0'6 in the portions first 
obtained, and in the last portions 5'6, 4'8, 5*1, 4*9 per cent, 
of fat, i.e., about seven times as much as in the first portions. 

Hence it follows that a good average milk can be obtained only if the 
udder is entirely emptied, and the milk obtained is well mixed. It is 
evident that in the establishments for the milk-cure the milking into 
ihe glass, still so much admired, yields milk of a very unequal compo- 
sition, and is to be abandoned, a matter to which the physicians of these 
establishments should attend. Secondly, it must be at once pronounced 
a fraud when a producer of milk, e.g., seeks to collect the last fraction 
of a milking separately, 1 and sells it as cream or uses it for the produc- 
tion of butter (Wiirzburg, " three groschen cream," according to Her/), 
whilst he sells the first portions (milk which has in a certain sense been 
already skimmed in the cow) as new milk. Fleischmann says very 
justly : "Every buyer of milk assumes tacitly that he obtains milk 
which represents the average produce of one cow or of several cows, 
and every seller acknowledges this supposition as a matter of course." 
The first couple of strokes should not be collected, but should serve in 
;i manner to rinse out the excretory ducts, removing impurities and 
microbia which have entered 

4. The time of milking has no distinct influence upon the quality of 
Ihe milk if it is performed at exactly equal intervals of twelve hours, 
/.<'., evening and morning. If cows are milked three times daily, e.g., 
morning, noon, and evening, the quantity of milk after the shorter 
intervals (therefore at noon and in the evening) is smaller, but its per- 
centage of fat or of solids is rather higher. A cow, if milked on suc- 
cessive days at exactly identical times, gives milk of almost exactly 
identical composition even if her food has been changed ; upon this fact 
depends the process of the coir-house tast, 294. Moderate differences 
may be produced by the manner of milking, by the physical condition 
of the cow, &c. Even a strange locality and an unaccustomed milker 
are said to have an influence. 

f). The age of the cow or the number of calvings has an influence 
ii] ton the milk which is but little understood. Cows are not allowed to 
conceive prior to their third year ; pregnancy lasts 284 days. Colostrum 
is secreted for a short time before and after the birth, and then milk 
for 300 days. The quantities of milk after the several births increase 
from 1530 litres at the first to 2350 at the sixth, and decrease to 480 
litres at the fourteenth (Fleischmann). A decided influence of the 
number of the pregnancies upon the composition of the milk has not 
been hitherto detected ; aged cows often give strikingly inferior milk. 
The researches of Vieth, of England, carried out on an enormous

MOST FREQUENT SOPHISTICATIONS OF MILK. 83 

amount of material, showed that the best milk is always obtained in 
October, November, and December. This seems to depend less on the 
conditions of food than that about this time most cows are approaching 
the end of their period of lactation. 

The milk is affected in a quite irregular manner if the rut appears in 
the cows in the course of the period of lactation ; sometimes the milk 
remains unaffected, sometimes it becomes scanty but rather richer. 
Occasionally it curdles on boiling even when fresh ; at other times it 
is unchanged in quantity but thin and poor. 

7. The milk is greatly affected if the cows are taken ill ; 
intestinal disturbances act like defective nutriment. Accord- 
ing to Fleischmanii the specific gravity in simple indigestion 
may often fall to 27 or 29. What can be said on the 
special abnormities of freshly drawn milk within the narrow 
limits of this book has already been given. 



APPENDIX TO SECTION B. 
THE MOST FREQUENT SOPHISTICATIONS OF MILK. 

291. The favourite sophistications of milk consist, on the 
one hand, in the more "or less complete removal of the cream 
and the other on the addition of water. Adulterators 
frequently apply both these methods simultaneously, from 
the following reasons : 

If milk is deprived of a large part of its lightest con- 
stituent, the fat (specific gravity at 15 0'93), it becomes 
specifically heavier, and a simple determination of its specific 
gravity reveals the fraud. But if to a milk which in spite of 
its fat is still heavier than water, on account of its dissolved 
salts, sugar, and albumenoids (1'029 to 1-033), we add water, 
its specific gravity will fall below the normal limits and thus 
betray the sophistication. It is evident that simultaneous 
skimming and watering, if carried on under the guidance of 
the lactometer, may produce a milk of the same specific 
gravity as the new milk. 

Experienced milk sophisticators add to the new milk, 
whether pure or watered, so much skim milk that its specific 
gravity exactly comes up to the limit fixed by authority, or 
they mix the skimmed milk with the smallest quantity of 



84 MILK. 

new milk, which brings it to the prescribed weight of 
half-milk. 

In comparison with these methods of sophistication all 
others fall far into the background. It is beyond doubt 
that the additions again and again mentioned in books 
chalk, milk of lime, gum, emulsion of oil of almonds, cane- 
sugar, starch, or even calves' brains stirred up (!) have, in 
recent days at least, been very rarely observed. I shall 
therefore not give any particulars as to their (usually for 
the most part easy) detection. On the addition of starch, 
see 270; for gum, see 215; for cane-sugar, consult 
220. Moreover, 1 per cent, of cane-sugar betrays itself 
by the taste. Concerning soda and preservative agents see 
283. On one occasion ultramarine was found to the extent 
of 82 mgrm. per litre. 

A refined fraud has been several times detected in France. 
There is added to new milk a quantity of heated skim-milk 
which has recovered by heating the opacity which it had 
lost by skimming. A chemical examination easily discovers 
the removal of the fat, but optical methods fail completely. 

C. Decision on Milk. 

292. As milk is consumed very extensively without 
previous boiling, the following pages treat always of deci- 
sions on unboiled milk. If by boiling a number of the 
grounds enumerated for objection are obviated, they must 
still be taken into account in the decision, since milk is 
universally sold unboiled. The bulk of the public are not 
convinced of the necessity of boiling, and no one can judge by 
the mere appearance of milk whether it must be boiled, nor 
whether it has been boiled or not. The chief questions which 
we are to answer are the following : 

1. Does the milk in question contain the proportion of 
nutrient substances which we should expect, and if 
not, why not ? 

a. Because the cows are in a condition unfit for 
producing milk ? 



DECISION AS REGARDS NUTRITIVE VALUE. 85 

b. Because the milk has been subjected to fraudu- 

lent manipulations ? 

2. Is the milk fresh, endowed with all the attributes of an 

article of consumption, i.e., of agreeable taste and 
normal appearance, &c., or is it unappetising, unclean, 
entering into decomposition, or already decomposed ? 

3. Is the milk free from hurtful substances, and from 

foreign substances altogether ? 
a. From chemical poisons ? 

1. From the cow. 

2. Introduced through secondary channels. 

I. From other additions (water, preservative agents, 
starch, &e.) ? 

c. From all exciters of infection ? 

1. Derived from the cow. 

2. Introduced secondarily, that is, by contact 

with impure hands and utensils, by the 
addition of water, or by standing in sick- 
rooms or infected stalls. 

As soon as one of these points is answered unfavourably 
for the vendor the hygienist must object to the milk, whether 
the cows are diseased or badly fed, or whether intentional 
sophistication has taken place. 

i. Decision on Milk as regards its Nutritive Value. 

293. If milk in its proportion of fat and solids falls 
below the minimum which is demanded by 1 local regulation 
for the district in question, it must be pronounced of inferior 
quality. In most parts of Germany from 2J to 3 per cent, 
would be an easily fulfilled demand made upon new milk. 
The project for an imperial ordinance on milk-control pro- 
posed to accept 2J per cent, of fat, which in South Germany 
at least would permit of a very extensive removal of cream ; 
Berlin required 2 '7 per cent, of fat; Paris, 3 '5 per cent.; 
New York, 3 per cent. ; London, 3 per cent. 



Tiiis value is to be ascertained by stall-trials. 



86 MILK. 

A milk of inferior nutritive value must be condemned 
by the physician from the point of view of the physiology 
of nutrition as a scarcely suitable food for invalids and 
children ; its use may, e.g., render the success of milk-cures 
questionable. 

If the courts of justice have to decide whether a milk of 
low value is inferior with or without the fault of the vendor, 
the hygienist has to raise the question whetlier the milk, in 
addition to its inferior value, may not possess other suspicious 
attributes. For this purpose an examination of the cause of 
the inferiority becomes necessary. 

2. Decision as to the Addition of Water and the 
Removal of Cream. 

294. If we have to do with the milk of the dairymen, a 
mixture of very many samples, a certain decision on the 
addition of water and the abstraction of cream may be easily 
arrived at, since mixed milk must always correspond with the 
average milk of the district. 

If we have the collective milk of a small dairy farmer 
(three or four cows), our opinion must here be less certain, 
since in fact several cows may simultaneously yield abnor- 
mally bad milk ; the decision is quite uncertain when, accord- 
ing to the declaration of the vendor, the question is about 
the milk of a single cow. 

In the two latter cases an absolutely certain decision can 
be arrived at merely by the so-called stall-trial. As soon as 
practicable (one or at most three days after the milk has been 
objected to) the cow or cows must be thoroughly milked into 
empty vessels, at the same hour as the last milking, under 
official control. The milking must be performed by an 
experienced hand by a stranger, if it is officially demanded. 
The milk must then be very well stirred for taking the 
sample. 

If the milk is found identical on each occasion, the vendor 
or producer incurs no penalty; but hygiene demands that 
even in this case milk of decidedlv inferior value should be

excluded from sale, or that it should at least be made pub- 
licly known that at present the cows of A. B. are yielding 
milk of inferior value. When the producer, as shown by a 
new investigation, is again able (whether by improved diet 
or by decreased exertion 1 ) to supply milk of normal quality, 
the fact is again made known. Such means would rapidly 
lead to an improvement in the quality of milk, as they have 
already done, e.g., in Brunswick. 

295. In many cases, certainly after the analysis has 
shown suspicious numerical values in a milk, the stall-trial 
will not exonerate the producer, but will lead more assuredly 
to the penalty as it reveals the fraud. It is then in such cases 
demanded that the expert should give a decision as to what 
has been done to the milk, whether merely removal of 
cream, merely addition of water, or both. If a stall -trial has 
been made, these questions may be exactly answered ; but if 
such a trial is wanting, from whatever reason, the average 
composition of the milk of the district is taken as a basis. 

It must be here conceded that recently single investigators, 
at least for certain beasts, after a series of careful experi- 
ments, allege a strongly fluctuating composition of milk from 
day to day, notwithstanding the most uniform feeding, and 
the observance of all precautions. Compare Macfarlane, 
J}eutsch. Molkerei Zeitung, 1891, p. 5, and Viertelg. f. Fortsch. 
d. Chemie der Nahrungs- und Genussmittel, 1891, p. 17. If 
these results appear more frequently, the entire significance 
of the stall-trial will be brought into question. 

Numerous formulae have already been drawn up for calculating the 
remaining constants of milk from the specific gravity and the per- 
centage of fat the two values most easily determined. Among these 
formulae the recent ones of Fleischmann (Dammer's Lexikon der 
Verfalschungen, article " Milch," by Fleischmann), deserve the greatest 
attention. 
He puts 

.s = specific gravity of the milk. 

d = degrees of the lactodensimeter, i.e., specific gravity of the 
milk minus the specific gravity of water.

beasts of burden. Editor.

r = total solids minus fat = (t-f) in per cents, by weight. 
m = specific gravity of total solids. 

We have then the following relations, which enable us to calculate t 
from / and s : 



(2.)/=0'833f- 2-22. 



2-665 

s 

100s -100 



We will now draw conclusions from the values obtained for s, /, , 
and m. 

1. If .s, /, and t are uniformly diminished as compared with the stall- 
trial or the average, so that r also becomes small, a corresponding addi- 
tion of water has taken place. In this case m has remained unchanged, 
and gives a value approximating to 1'3 or 1-4. 

2. If /alone is remarkably low, t less reduced, s increased, and r 
normal, cream has been abstracted. Its amount is found by comparison 
with the percentage of fat in the milk from the stall-trial. In this case 
in will be raised decidedly above 1'3 or T4, since the light fat has been 
removed from the solids, thus increasing their specific gravity. 

M. If / is remarkably low, t and r reduced, but s tolerably normal, 
we have combined falsification of adding water and abstracting 
cream. 

In order to obtain more exact values as to the degree of watering, of 
removing cream, or of combined falsification, we have from Recknagel 
(tiechste Versaitnnl. der fr. rer. layer Chan., Munich, 1887) formulas l 
in which 

all letters marked with 1 refer to stall-trial milk, 
all marked with 2 refer to the sample in question. 

hi addition to the above signs, there occur also the following : 

a- = cc. of water which have been artificially added in 100 <jrm.

v = cc. of water which have been artificially added to 100 gnu.

those of Kecknagel a table which, without calculation, enables us to read off

The following four examples will show how the formula acts

whence w = 2'8 (31/8 - 28'5) + 3 (3'47 - 3'09),

w = 10 '38 per cent.

V - "100 -To-38~-~3 ; 09 "~ 



i.e., no fat has been removed, but about 10 per cent, of water has been 
added.

i.e., whilst the milk contains in 100 parts 21 parts of added water (or 
100 parts of the original milk have been diluted to 125 parts), the milk 
has riot been deprived of cream, as is approximately = 0. That the 
minimum surplus of fat of 0'05 is to be explained by small errors of 
observation or by the manner of sampling requires no demonstration.

90 MILK. 

We have here a combined sophistication ; the milk has been first 
partially skimmed, and then from 7 to 8 per cent, of water has been 
added. The specific gravity would here have shown nothing suspicious ; 
indeed, in many districts where the cattle give poor milk, a sample with 
d = 32 '5 and/ = 2 '86 would be scarcely objected to. 

296. The attitude assumed by hygiene in reference to 
skimming and watering is perfectly definite (even if we dis- 
regard the above-mentioned decrease in value). 

1. A removal of cream by centrifugalising adds no further 
disadvantages to the reduction of value, as the creaming is 
effected rapidly (half an hour), and the milk remains fresh. 

2. Milk deprived of cream by standing in the ordinary 
manner (twelve to forty-eight hours at 10 to 15) is to be 
judged according to 332, and according to 297 is no 
longer to be considered fresh milk. Whoever buys new milk 
has, according to a tacit supposition, a right to entire milk. 

3. Watering involves the risk especially if well-water is 
used from wells communicating with cesspools that organ- 
isms pathogenous for man may pass into the milk, and may 
multiply largely therein, especially if it is improperly pre- 
served. It cannot be denied that water must be used for 
rinsing out the pails, but milk-cans which are rinsed with 
water containing the bacilli of typhoid fever, and are dried 
in an invert position, will introduce into the milk far fewer 
typhoid bacilli capable of development than if only 5 per cent, 
of water were directly added. In Holland, incomprehensibly 
enough, watered milk may be sold if it is only duly declared. 



3. Freshness and Relishing Quality of Milk. 

297. As soon as milk is in such a state that it is con- 
sumed by man without relish, or with repugnance even 
if raw it must be objected to, although no proof can be 
submitted that it is injurious. So long as there is no place 
provided for the sale of boiled milk, not hurtful but inferior 
in value as there is in some towns for meat this is the 
only point of view from which it can hygienically be regarded. 

1 . Any milk which has passed the incubation stage of the 



FRESHNESS AND EELISHING QUALITY OF MILK. 91 

formation of acid, i.e., which requires for 100 cc. more than 
10 cc. of one-fourth normal soda-lye, may be suspected as on 
the point of turning sour, and must on no account be pro- 
nounced fresh milk. It is not yet exactly unrelishing, but 
it is no food for children and invalids, i.e., it is no longer 
milk of the first quality. 1 As cleanly milk at 15 does not 
vary in its degree of acidity in thirty-six hours, such milk is 
either abnormally dirty or mixed with stale residues of milk, 
abnormally warm (not cooled, conveyed on summer days\ or 
it has been kept for an unusually long time. Milk which 
requires per 100 cc. from 11 to 11 '2 cc. of one-fourth normal 
soda-lye coagulates on boiling. 

2. Any milk in which there may be detected the admix- 
ture of any solid whatever (flocks, clots, &c.), which on 
standing for two hours in a measuring-cylinder deposits a 
sediment (cow-dung, sandy particles), possesses a changed 
appearance, or which only on boiling coagulates in flocks or 
altogether, is undoubtedly repugnant, and often injurious to 
health. 

Flocks occur in colostrum ;' it occasions diarrhoea in children, and 
has an unpleasant taste, on account of its low proportion of sugar. Its 
sale is generally prohibited until about eight days after the birth. 

In inflammation of the udder (mastitis) the milk is flocculent, gene- 
rally containing blood and pus, and it may unconditionally become 
dangerous (Vaughan, Arch. f. Hygiene, vii.). 

The slimy milk, forming long threads, as it seems in many diseases 
of the udder to be directly emitted, and which in other cases only 
arises outside the cow, is harmless, but per se repugnant. In Holland, 
however, milk is intentionally made slimy by adding portions of milk 
containing the micrococcus of the long " wei ; " in northern countries 
something similar is effected by the addition of Pinguicula. 

Milk seems never to be obtained free from small fragments of excre- 
ment, whence it is always strained before being sold to the public. If 
this is omitted, it must be pronounced insufficiently clean. 

Renk is unwilling to sanction any sediment. According to our 
experience in Wiirzburg, milk containing not more than 2 mgrm. dirt 



1 In many places "sour milk" is prepared for sale as a refreshing article 
of food and consumption. Here, of course, acidity, high number of microbia 
( 285), and coagulation are not defects, but necessary properties. Of course 
only the new milk of healthy cows should be set to turn sour, and that in clean 
rooms and vessels. If a down of Oidium lactis is developed on the surface, 
the milk is not appetising. 



92 MILK. 

per litre may be regarded as sufficiently clean (see 286). On the 
contrary, many wholesale dairies demand from the producer unstrained 
milk, in order to judge of the degree of cleanliness in the production. 

3. All milk which deviates decidedly in colour from the 
normal quality (it takes a pale yellow tint when the cows 
are turned out to graze) is to be rejected as offensive and 
occasionally injurious to health. 

The presence of pus renders milk yellowish, highly repulsive, and 
dangerous to health. In "yellow gait," an infectious inflammation of 
the udder observed in Switzerland, and occasioned by streptococci, the, 
milk is deep yellow, flocculent, and quite irregular in composition. 
Bloody milk may be occasioned by rough milking, the ingestion of 
turpentine, and, it is alleged, by the consumption of much fresh clover. 
In jaundice the yellow bile-pigment finds its way into the milk. 

Blue, yellow, or red milk proves prolonged, unclean, warm housing. 
Blue milk caused by Bacillus ci/anogenus sen syvcyanus is harmless 
according to Neelsen, Hu'ppe, and Haubner, but hurtful according to 
Hosier and Uffelmann. Hosier's observations refer to cows suffering 
from gastritis : a mother with her two children, after taking such milk, 
were attacked with febrile enteritis with prostration the Bacillus 
cyanogeaus was certainly innocent of the mischief (Virch. Arch. vol. 43). 
Concerning the harmfulness of yellow and red milk there exists no 
evidence. Abnormally watery milk, as yielded by many diseased cows, 
often attracts attention by its blueish colour. 

A series of plants are said to colour milk, e.g., yellow or reddish 
carrots, madder, rhubarb, species of bed-straw ; blue alkanet, mercu- 
rialis, melampyrum, species of polygonum, &c. Further experiments 
are here desirable. 

Such colours, if they occur, may often be difficult to interpret. From 
a hygienic point of view they appear scarcely dangerous, but always 
unpleasant. 

4. Any milk of an abnormal taste and smell is always 
inferior in value, but mostly disgusting, and sometimes even 
dangerous to health. 

Hilk tastes disagreeably rancid, bitter, &c., immediately after milk- 
ing, if half-decayed fodder has been consumed, or rancid oil-cake, 
cocoa-nut cake, spoiled beets and potatoes, sour brewers' grains. But 
certain plants, even if eaten fresh, give the milk a bad taste, e.g., beet 
leaves and heads, various Compositse (e.g., wormwood, &c.), too much 
pea- or bean-straw. Hilk of a bad taste is often injurious, especially 
after the consumption of spoiled, rancid, or fermenting fodder, pro- 
ducing intestinal catarrh. Milk previously good often readily takes 
a sour, bitter, irritating taste in consequence of the action of schizo- 
mycetes ( 285). The milk may also be rendered bitter by scliizo- 



POISONS IN MILK. 93 

mycetes whilst in the udder. If the bitter taste can be traced to 
schizomycetes, the milk is highly suspicious as regards its injurious 
action on health. 

Cows which have recovered from inflammation of the udder often 
yield milk of a salty taste. In general, however, the milk is salty only 
from one or from some of the teats, or only the first part of the milk 
drawn from one teat is affected. The taste of the milk is often more 
saline than if 5 grm. of common salt had been added per litre. The 
proportion of ash is often raised twofold (Engling). I am not aware 
whether such milk is injurious. 

New milk has often an abnormal odour if the cows have been brows- 
ing on a variety of strongly-smelling plants garlic, carraway, fennel 
or if they have been taking strong-scented medicines, e.g., camphor, 
oil of turpentine, &c. 

If milk is allowed to remain in strongly-smelling places it may 
absorb mouldy smells, or also the smell of carbolic acid, &c. 

For a full discussion of the most important faults of milk, chemical 
and bacteriological, a subject far from having been as yet satisfactorily 
investigated, see Hess, Schaffner and Bondzynski, Milchzeitung, 1891, 
No. 13. 

4. Poisons in Milk. 1 

298. If milk from any source has had a poisonous action, 
we may presume that milk from the same source will con- 
tinue to have a poisonous action, and proceed accordingly. 
But milk is only examined for poisons on very special 
evidence. 

Poisons find their way into milk : 

1. From fodder. Occasionally the transit of poisonous 
substances into milk is said to have been observed 
from poisonous plants, such as veratrum, belladonna 
(atropin), colchicum, &c. 

According to Eatti the inhabitants of a district of Rome 
were taken ill in consequence of consuming the milk of goats 



1 For the detection of these poisons the instructions hold good which have 
been given in 251 concerning meat. According to Vanghan tyrotoxicon is 
detected as follows : The milk, coagulated spontaneously or by the intentional 
addition of acids, is filtered, the filtrate is rendered slightly alkaline with 
potassa-lye, and shaken out with ether. The residue left on the evaporation 
of the ether consists of a little water, from which crystals of tyrotoxicon are 
deposited possessing an unpleasant smell and taste. Very small quantities 
given to young cats in milk produce violent vomiting and diarrhrea, and may 
prove fatal. A critique of the chemical reactions of tyrotoxicon may be found, 
by H. A. Weber, in Journ. Am. Chem. Soc. (1890, p. 485). 



94 MILK. 

which had grazed in meadows abounding in colchicum 
(Jahresber. f. Pliarmacie, 1885, p. 487). Feeding on artichokes 
is also said to have occasioned the production of very dangerous 
milk (?) Ckemiker Zeitung (xv. p. 773). Kinimel Findlay 
in the Miincli. Med. Wochensclirift (1890, p. 64) describes a dis- 
ease of cows in Ohio caused by (infected ?) grass. The milk 
may prove fatal to man. (Milk sickness.) 

According to Bollinger (Deutsche Zeit. /. Thiermed., vol. vi.) 
the milk of cows was poisonous which had been fed upon oil- 
cake containing seeds of castor-oil plant. 

Goats' milk has proved rapidly fatal when these animals 
had fed upon laburnum, which they endure very readily. 

2. Small quantities (generally mere traces) of arsenic, 
lead, copper, antimony, mercury, iodine, aloes, may 
pass into milk from medicines given to cattle ; lead 
may also be introduced by the use of food coated with 
plumbiferous dust (near white-lead works). 

Poisonings in this manner have not come to my knowledge. 
The following observation of Harms (Jahresber. 5 und 6 der 
hannov. Thierarzneischule) show that great caution is necessary. 
A milch-cow received a dose of 45 gnu. tartar-emetic ; 15 litres 
of her milk were given to five kids and two puppies. Violent 
diarrhoea occurred in all these animals. 

j. Lead, copper, and zinc may be introduced into milk 
from the vessels in which it is preserved, especially if 
it has become sour. In Wiirteuiberg the use of zinc 
and copper utensils is positively prohibited. Tinned 
iron is in general use, but enamelled pans are prefer- 
able. 1 Fleck is of opinion that the absorption of zinc 
is the very cause why milk keeps well in zinc pails. 

4. By the action of schizomycetes. Vanghan regards 
tyrotoxicon as the cause of summer diarrhoea and 
cholera infantum. This fact has been demonstrated 
by a series of severe, in part even deadly poisoning 
cases in America consequent upon the use of milk, 
vanilla-ice, &c. In Europe it has not yet been shown 
with certainty (Arch. /. Hyg. , viii., and Centralblatt 
f. JJahteriologie, iii. 591.) Hitherto, moreover, the

carbonate, capable of being attacked by sour milk. Editor. 



MICRO-ORGANISMS IN MILK. 95 

exciting microbe has not been discovered. Milk con- 
taining ptomaines may generally be detected by its 
smell and taste. The European records of cases con- 
tain a largQ number of milk- and cheese- poisonings, 
which may be not unnaturally referred to tyrotoxi- 
con (Jansen Hyg. Rundschau, i. 233). 

The symptoms of poisoning with tyrotoxicon are : violent vomiting, 
diarrhoea with watery dejections, prostration, pains in the limbs, head- 
ache, violent thirst. Frequently also abdominal pain, sensation of cold, 
spasms of the muscles therefore a type of illness resembling cholera. 
The recovery is generally slow. 

5. Artificial Additions. 

| 299. Every milk containing any addition whatever is 
objectionable. Even though dextrine, gum, starch, &c., are 
harmless for adults, they are not necessarily so for the tender 
age of children (e.g., starch) ; further, only milk of inferior 
value is furnished with such additions. Concerning preser- 
vative agents see 231. Soda and sodium bicarbonate are 
utterly objectionable additions ( 283) ; they further serve 
to deceive the public as to the newness and cleanly condition 
of 'milk. Proust regards the addition of sodium carbonate 
as very hurtful to children (Milchzeitung, p. 273). Com- 
pare Lazarus, Wirkung der gebrduchlicheren Mittel zar Milck- 
konservirung (Zeit. f. Hygiene, viii.). 

6. Micro-organisms in Milk. 

300. According to 285 all milk met with in trade, 
if not sterilised, contains microbia, mostly in abundance. 
The enumerations which are hitherto available do not permit 
of any practical hygienic application, or at least they scarcely 
give us a deeper insight than the simpler titrations of the 
acidity. The determinations of the several kinds of microbia 
may be more important. Any milk which contains bacteria 
pathogenic for man is injurious to man ; if it contains merely 
species pathogenic to the lower animals it must at least be 
characterised as repulsive, keeping it distinctly in view that 



96 MILK. 

our experience of the effects upon man of such milk are as 
yet very defective. The milk of cattle suffering from acute 
disease is almost always scanty, poor in nutritive matter, and 
of a non-appetising appearance. In general, therefore, all 
milk of diseased animals must be treated as directly per- 
nicious ; that is, it must be excluded from human food, and 
at most used after boiling for the food of beasts. Injuries 
to health from milk occur most frequently in the following 
cases : 

In tuberculosis. The bacilli of tubercle are found not merely in the 
milk of cows which suffer from tuberculosis of the udder, diagnosed by 
nodose hardening without inflammation (Bang). Hirschberger, in 
Bollinger's Institute (Dentsch. Arch. /. Klin. Med. 1889, p. 500), inocu- 
lated guinea-pigs eleven times successfully with the contents of the 
udders of twenty cows, in which on slaughtering tuberculosis (in some 
cases only slight) was recognised, though not in the udder. As about 
10 per cent, of milch cows are tuberculous the danger to health by the 
use of the raw milk of one cow appears very considerable. By centri- 
fugal treatment the bacilli of tubercle pass along with other bacteria 
from the milk into the cream though the milk remains infectious. 
(Bang, Deutsche Zeitsch rift f. Thiermed., xvii. 1). 

Fortunately mixed milk, as purchased, is generally harmless ; ten 
samples of mixed trade-milk purchased at Munich were all harmless. 
Natural milk containing the bacilli, if diluted forty, fifty, or a hundred 
times, is found to have become harmless (Gebhard, in Bollinger's 
] nstitute). 

In foot and mouth disease. After the consumption of unboiled milk 
children are often attacked with aphthae and intestinal catarrh, and 
calves still more frequently. The exciter of the infection is quite 
unknown. Heating to 00 does not destroy the virulence which is only 
put an end to by ebullition (Dieckerhoff). 

In cases of suppuration on or in the milk-glands staphylococci and 
possibly streptococci become mixed with the milk. In cases also of 
artificial infection with Staphylococcus pyogencs aitreus its transit into 
the milk has been observed. The ingestion of milk with which 
cultures of staphylococcus had been mixed, proved fatal to young 
rabbits in about one-fourth of the cases. Karlinski (Centralblatt f. 
Jfakterwlogie, vi. and viii. 375) and Eiselsberg (Berlin Klin. Wochen- 
sc/mft, 1891, No. 23). 

In Mastitis contagiosa Nocard and Mollereau isolated a streptococcus 
which, if injected into the glands of healthy animals, rendered them ill. 
The sour, slimy milk was indeed harmless for animals fed with it, 
which, however, does not prove its harmlessness to man. Kitt's 
studies on mastitis and the accompanying changes in the milk have 
made known a pathogenic bacterium (Deuts'-h. Zeit. f. Thier. Medecin, 



MICRO-ORGANISMS IN MILK. 97 

xii.). Kitt, however, does not regard the unitary character of the 
process as probable. 

In splenic fever the transition of the bacilli into the milk has 
already been observed. The milk of cattle suffering from rabies does 
not contain the poison of that disease, as Pasteur and Zagari have 
shown experimentally (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, iii. 409). With this 
practical experience agrees ; the harmfulness of such milk has never 
been observed, but often its harmlessness. 

In cattle-plague and charbon symptomatique milk has never been 
found injurious, but it is exceedingly disgusting. 

In sepsis (putrescent inflammation of the uterus) the milk is 
extremely suspicious and probably not seldom poisonous. 

301. It must never be forgotten that microbia can be 
introduced into milk not merely from the udders of diseased 
cattle, but may be transferred by particles of dung, frag- 
ments of straw, &c., e.g., with bacilli of splenic fever, of 
Oidium albicans, and of Bacillus coli communis. 

R. Demme isolated from milk insufficiently boiled, which 
had acted pathogenically or toxically upon infants, a species 
of saccharomyces (S. rubcr), evidently closely allied to the 
" red yeast " of laboratories. Puppies fed with milk-cultures 
of this microbe became ill (Centralblatt f. Balderiologie, ix. 
270). This micro-organism is certainly derived not from the 
cow but from the surroundings. 

It has been repeatedly remarked that at a suitable tempera- 
ture the majority of pathogenic bacteria multiply luxuriantly. 
This is especially the case with the exciters of typhus, 
cholera, pneumonia, diphtheria, glanders, and with species 
producing septic and suppurative processes. Such proof is 
wanting for the bacilli of tubercle. We cannot here examine 
whether numerous epidemics of typhus, scarlatina, diphtheria, 
&c., of late years can be rightly referred to the use of milk. 
See references concerning such epidemics in Uffelmann's 
Jahresberichte uber die Fortscliritte der Hygiene. To my 
knowledge the presence of the bacilli of typhus or diphtheria 
in milk has not been demonstrated in such epidemics. See 
E. Roth (Milchtyphus Vierteljahrschrift f. oeff. G-esundheits- 
pflege, 1890, xxii. part ii.) and Almquist (Zeit.f. Hygiene, viii.). 
However imperfect the proof of a connection between the use 
of milk and the attack of illness has been, in many cases the 

VOL. II. G 



98 MILK. 

possibility or rather the probability of an infection by means 
of milk remains unconditional, for all cases the exciting 
organisms of which retain their vitality in milk. 

In such considerations it must be remembered that non- 
sterilised milk aifords a far worse nutrient medium than 
sterilised, and that the acid formed attacks the pathogenic 
microbia in a shorter time. 

According to L. Heim (Arbeit, d. Kais. Gesundh., vol. v.), the exciters 
of the following diseases remain capable of development in the most 
favourable cases in days : 

Cholera. Typhus. Tuberculosis. 

In milk 6 35 10 

In butter ... 32 21 30 

In curd ... 1 2 

In whey ... 2 1 14 

In cheese . . 1 3 14 

Milk coagulated with rennet is regarded as cheese. Sterilisation was 
intentionally avoided, no enumeration was attempted, the presence of 
the microbia being merely established. On one occasion Heim observed 
a longer continuance of life in warm milk than in cold. Hesse observed 
that on one occasion the bacilli of typhus remained alive for four 
months. Gasperini (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, vii. 641) found the 
bacilli of tubercle remaining alive in butter for 68 and 120 days. 
Lower values were found for butter by Laser (Zeit. f. Hygiene, x.). 
Typhus bacilli remained alive in butter from five to seven days, 
cholera bacilli for five, and the bacilli of tubercle for less than twelve 
days. 

Concerning scarlatina and the other acute exanthemata a 
decision is attainable only by means of epidemiological studies, 
as their exciting organisms are unknown. All the positive 
statements, especially of English investigators, on the microbe 
of scarlatina are hitherto inaccurate. A so-called epidemic 
of scarlet fever in cows was found to be cow-pox (Crook- 
shank, Centralblatt /. Bakteriologie, iii. 331). In other cases 
eruptions on the teats came into question. Klein's micro- 
coccus of scarlatina cannot be distinguished from Streptococcus 
pyogcncs. 

7. Decision on Milk for Infants. 

302. There has been recently a universal effort in cities 
to procure an especially rich milk for infants. It is the duty 



DECISION ON MILK FOR INFANTS. 99 

of hygiene when an opinion is required on such milk, or on 
an entire dairy, to see above all things 

1. Whether the cattle kept are of races which give rich 
milk ( 290). 

2. Whether healthy cattle are kept, especially if any cows 
suffering from tuberculosis or foot-and-mouth disease are used 
to supply milk. Consequently a permanent veterinary con- 
trol is essential, or, as Schmidt-Miilheim proposed, an exami- 
nation of milk for tubercle-bacilli (by inoculating guinea-pigs) 
is made monthly or every two months. 

Plaut has recently observed that the acidity of the quite 
fresh milk of diseased cows is almost invariably abnormally 
low. He proposes to include a titration of acidity in the 
preliminary examination of the health of cows. 

3. Whether the cattle are rationally fed. Hitherto dry 
food, i.e., good hay not mouldy or scorched and grain, 
were considered as the ideal ; latterly green food from good 
meadows is regarded as perfectly suitable.. All the inferior 
foods mentioned in 390 must be absolutely excluded from 
use. 

4. Whether the cattle, the stall, the appliances and milkers 
are carefully cleanly. 

5. Whether every occasion is carefully avoided which 
might render milk obtained in good condition subsequently 
hurtful. Milk must therefore be rapidly cooled, not pre- 
served in vessels of lead, zinc, or copper, or in unclean 
wooden pails, nor allowed to remain in close, mouldy rooms, 
&c. Dwelling-rooms and especially sick-rooms are absolutely 
unfit for keeping milk. In domestic epidemics in the milk- 
business, e.g., on the outbreak of scarlatina, diphtheria, 
typhus, cholera, &c., the sale of milk must at once cease. 

6. Whether preservative agents are excluded (see 235). 
In any case it must only be given to children when boiled. 
The demands just made for the production and the sale 

of milk for children, invalids, and convalescents hold good 
naturally as the ideal for the total production of milk.

APPENDIX L PRESERVED MILK. 1 

303. We distinguish : 

1. Milk evaporated to the consistence of a syrup. 

a. Sweetened milk to which an eighth of its volume 
of cane-sugar has been added, and which is 
then evaporated down in a vacuum apparatus 
to a third of its volume, and is then rapidly 
cooled and at once soldered up in tins. 
I. Unsweetened evaporated milk. Formerly such 
preparations did not keep well, but now, e.y., 
Loeffluiid obtains a product which keeps for 
an indefinite time, and is known as " Allgau 
Cream -Milk." It is evaporated down to from 
one-third to one-fourth of its volume, and is 
then heated to above 100 after being soldered 
up. 

Tins containing 330 grin, with 37 per cent, 
of solids, yield, if made up to 1 litre, an 
excellent unsweetened milk. The contents of 
the tins will keep indefinitely, being really 
sterilised. According to Soxhlet it is import- 
ant to free the milk by centrifugal action from 
the " milk-slime " (a little albumen and potas- 
sium phosphate) which is enclosed in all the 
coarser impurities, not separable by the finest 
sieve. 

"2. Preserved Milk. Milk enclosed in tins, not concentrated 
and not sweetened, but sterilised by over-heating. 
Without great importance as being too bulky. 
3. So called milk-powder. Milk evaporated to the state of 
a powder and retaining only 5 per cent, of water.

Even the best useful preparations, e.g., from Drenkhan in 
Holstein, do not yield a product exactly like milk ; the solution

is somewhat imperfect, and a slight accompanying taste of 
milk which has been boiled for a long time is unmistakable. 

The examination for determining the nutritive value in all 
these cases is to be conducted according to Section IV., and 
to the rules specially given for milk. Further, all the tests 
must be undertaken which are practised for preserved foods 
(animal and vegetable) ( 265). The decision upon their 
value as nutriment for adults on the basis of these examina- 
tions presents no difficulties. For the nutrition of infants the 
high proportion of cane-sugar in many preparations is very 
disturbing. See Uffelmann and Munk, Handbuck der 
Didtetik, p. 306. 

Very recently "sterilised milk for children" is prepared 
industrially in many towns. What we understand under milk 
for children has been said above ; in testing the sterility by 
means of plate- cultures the following must be considered. 
If the milk was sterile it is possible that micro-organisms may 
have subsequently entered owing to bad soldering. The ex- 
amination should therefore be made not only on freshly- 
sterilised milk, but on such as has been kept for about a week. 
The keeping should be twofold ; some bottles are kept in the 
incubation-niche, which only really sterile milk can bear 
without evincing decomposition ; other bottles are allowed to 
stand at the temperature of a dwelling-room, and are thus 
tested for their durability under the conditions of practice. 
In all cases we should wait for eight days before enumerat- 
ing the plates which have been made up, since microbia which 
have not been killed may be so enfeebled that their develop- 
ment is much retarded. 

According to the researches of Freudenreich (Annal. de 
Microgr., 1888, No. 1) an absolute sterilisation of milk 
destruction not merely of cocci and bacilli, 1 but of the resist- 
ant spores of the latter is at present not practicable without 

1 According to the researches of Van Geuns (Arch. f. Hygiene, ix. ) the most 
important pathogenic species, when free from spores, are killed in one minute 
by a temperature of 60, though splenic fever and malignant redema require 
80 or 78. See also H. Bitter, Versuche uber das Pasteurisircn dtr 
Milch. Zeit.f. Hygiene, viiu

prolonged heating to 100 and upwards, and thus producing 
an irritating taste and a brownish colour, owing to a partial 
formation of caramel. For the present, therefore, we must 
be content to require of " sterilised " milk that if kept in a 
cool cellar for eight days not the slightest decomposition 
can be detected either by the senses or by acidimetry, 
but we must lay down the postulate that a method for the 
absolute sterilisation of milk on an industrial scale should 
be sought for. 1 

Concerning the difficulties of a perfect sterilisation of milk 
by the appliances of the laboratory and the household, com- 
pare the diligent investigation of E. Strub (Centralblatt f. 
Bakteriolor/ie, vii., Nos. 21 and 23, as also H. Bitter, VersucJic 
nber das Pasteurisiren der Milch. Zcitschrift f. Hygiene, viii.). 

APPENDIX II. CREAM. 

304. Cream is partly obtained by allowing milk to stand 
for some time at rest in cool rooms and skimming off the 
upper layer, or it is rapidly separated by means of centrifugal 
apparatus. 

The product brought to market as cream varies exceed- 
ingly in its composition. For instance, Sendtner found at 
Munich the following fluctuations in the price and com- 
position of cream :

1 Even the most recent process of Xeuhaus, Gronwald, and Oehlmaim of 
Berlin yields, according to Petri and Maassen (Arbeit, aus d. Kaiserl. 
Gesundheit. Amt., vii.), no sterile milk if resistent spores are present. The 
milk will doubtless keep for weeks and months at the temperature of a dwell- 
ing room, but often spoils in the incubation-niche. 



BIBLIOGRAPHY. 103 

Hence an accurate definition of cream is impossible ; its 
nutritive and commercial value is about in proportion to the 
percentage of fat. Cream readily turns sour, but in this 
state also it forms a special food. 

The acidity may be determined as for milk ( 282) ; for 
three separate specimens of " sweet cream " I consumed 
respectively per 100 grm. lO'O, 10*0, and 11-2 cc. of one- 
fourth normal soda-lye, i.e., values similar to those of milk 
not quite fresh. Two samples of " sour cream " required per 
100 grm. 33*0 and 41 '6 cc. of one-fourth normal soda-lye, 
which agrees with sour milk (see 286 and 297). 

The special hygienic requirements made upon sweet and 
sour cream do not differ from those made from sweet and 
sour milk (see 297).

SECTION IX. 

BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

1. BUTTER. 

305. Butter is a fat obtained from the milk of cows by 
mechanical manipulations, and used for human food partly 
un sal ted and partly salted. 

Whilst the other animal and vegetable fats and oils consist 
almost solely of the glycerine-compounds (glycerides) of 
palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, butter contains also the 
glycerides of lower, somewhat volatile fatty acids, chiefly 
butyric acid (but also capronic, caprylic, and caprinic acid). 
Spallanzani gives recently as the average composition of 
butter-fat 51 per cent, butyrin, TO per cent, capronin, 0*3 
per cent, caprylin and caprinin, and 9 3 '6 per cent, of glycer- 
ides of fixed fatty acids. The preparation of butter from 
milk renders it necessary that casein, water, milk-sugar, and 
salts are present in the best butter. In salt butter this " non- 
fat " is increased by the common salt used. 

After the butter has been melted all the " non-fat " collects 
at the bottom of the vessel. The butter-fat, when it has been 
decanted off clear, is no longer known as butter, but is called 
butter-melt. 1 

The most important tasks of a hygienic examination of 
butter are to determine 

1. Whether the permissible proportion of the ordinary 

impurities of butter (" non-fat ") has not been exceeded 
determination of fat. 

2. Whether no foreign (cheaper) fats have been incorpo- 

1 This method of preparing butter is very rarely used in Britain, and the 
German names given in the text have consequently no English equivalents, 
save the word " ghee," of Indian origin. Editor,

rated with the butter determination of volatile fatty 
acids and of the specific gravity. 

3. Whether the butter has undergone no additions of alien 

colouring-matters or preservative agents. 

4. Whether the butter is fresh or already in the course of 

decomposition (rancid). 

In taking samples of butter it must be kept in mind that often a 
piece of old or falsified butter is coated outwardly with a layer of fresh, 
pure butter to deceive the buyer. Such butter generally betrays itself 
on cutting the lumps by the difference of colours and the appearance 
of strata at the section. Melted butter which has not been stirred 
whilst congealing has a different composition in the parts at the margin 
of the vessel which were first solidified, and the portion at the centre 
which congealed latest. It may even occur that a portion remains 
liquid (butter-oil). If possible, therefore, the bulk should be thoroughly 
mixed before sampling, or small portions should be taken from different 
parts of the mass and mixed together. The outside of large lumps of 
butter is often paler in colour than the interior owing to the action of 
light ; the outside is generally more rancid than the inside and richer 
in bacteria. 

A. Examination of Butter. 
I. Examination with the Senses. 

30G. Consistence, colour, smell, and taste allow of many 
conclusions as to the nature of the butter. 

Abnormally hard butter is produced by feeding the cows with palm- 
kernels and linseed-cake. Excessively watery butter is often betrayed 
on spreading it out by the drops of water which issue ; excessive arti- 
ficial colouring is at once recognised by experienced buyers, and the 
flavour is an excellent preliminary test for the freshness of butter and 
for the manner of its preparation and the care employed. But for this 
purpose the butter should be heated to about 20, as in cold butter an 
unpleasant taste is less distinct. It may be at once distinguished 
whether butter has been made from fresh, sweet cream, e.y., obtained 
with the centrifugal apparatus (sweet-cream butter), or if it is a pre- 
paration from sour cream 1 which has been slowly separated and kept 
for a Ion" time. 



1 Sour butter is a bye-product of the manufacture of fat cheese. From the 
cheese milk, which still contains much albumen and fat, these substances are 
eliminated and churned along with cream. With good management products 
of a pleasant taste may be obtained, but very bad sorts are sometimes met 
with in trade. 



DETERMINATION OF ASH. 107 

Further causes for bad flavour are stated to be : feeding the cows 
with beets, or with spoiled earth-nut (Arachis) and cocoa-nut cake, 
&c., whilst the best-tasting butter so-called spring- or May-butter is 
obtained when the cows are at pasture, especially on mountain meadows. 



2. Determination of Moisture. 

307. We evaporate down 5 grm. of butter upon 30 to 
50 grm. of sand previously ignited and weighed as described 
for milk ( 274). The loss of weight shows the water. 

The attempt to expel the water by heating in a porcelain capsule 
without addition gives inaccurate results. The water is not readily 
expelled, and the lower fatty acids are volatilised. 

3. Determination of the Proportions of Fat and 
Non-fat. 

308. Five grammes of butter are heated in a porcelain 
capsule with 20 grm. gypsum (see 277) for six hours to 100, 
and frequently stirred with a glass rod. When cold it is 
extracted with absolute ether ( 214) until completely ex- 
hausted (six to eight hours). The ethereal extract, carefully 
evaporated in a capacious weighing-glass ( 214), must be 
perfectly homogeneous, and must not display any turbidity 
from drops of water. It must then be kept for an hour at 
a temperature not exceeding 100, allowed to cool in the 
exsiccator, and weighed. On subtracting the percentage of 
fat as found from 100 the remainder is "non-fat." 

A determination of albumen can be made in the residue free from 
fat according to Kjeldahl's method ( 212). 

4. Determination of Ash. 

309. We weigh off about 10 grm. butter in a platinum 
capsule, heating at first very slowly to prevent spirting, and 
then burn the butter with a small flame. The charcoal is 
extracted with water, according to 210. During the final 
ignition of the ash we must prevent loss from the decrepi- 
tation of the sodium chloride by covering the capsule with a 
plate of platinum. 



io8 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

The sodium chloride is extracted from the ash by means of hot water. 
The filtrate is made up to 100 cc., carefully and accurately neutralised 
with dilute nitric acid, and the chlorine is titrated in an aliquot part 
according to 175 (or, by preference, determined gravimetrically). The 
ash dissolved in hot dilute nitric acid may be examined for poisonous 
heavy metals according to the rules given for domestic utensils. But 
the heavy metals may be extracted sufficiently for a qualitative recogni- 
tion without incineration by heating with dilute hydrochloric acid. 

If the proportion of sodium chloride is alone to be determined, 
10 grm. butter are twice shaken up in the parting-funnel, each time 
with 40 cc. of warm water ; the watery extract is filtered when cold, 
made up to 100 cc. by washing with water, and then treated as above. 
Lactose may be extracted for analysis. 



5. Determination of Volatile Fatty Acids. 

310. From the point of view of the official inspection of 
foods, it is very important to ascertain whether butter has 
undergone an addition of foreign fats. Hygiene is also con- 
cerned in this determination. There is, indeed, no fear that 
poisons may insinuate themselves in such adulterations, 
since there is no poisonous fat available. But in view of the 
impossibility of the chemical detection of disgusting fats 
(e.g., those of cattle which have died a natural death), it is 
important that the addition of foreign fats to butter should 
be avoided. 

Of all the numerous methods which have been devised for 
controlling the purity of butter-fat, few, unfortunately, have 
proved trustworthy, hence only the most customary is here 
mentioned. Numerous procedures, of older date, formerly 
valued, have been abandoned, and even the one here 
described is of limited applicability. It depends on the fact 
that of all the animal and vegetable fats butter contains 
by far the highest proportion of the lower, readily volatile 
fatty acids. 

The original Reichert-Meissl method has experienced 
several improvements since its publication in 1879, especially 
at the hands of Sendtner and Wollny ; its execution demands 
the most scrupulous observance of the instructions in seem- 
ingly insignificant details, and experienced chemists always 
carry out the determination in duplicate, and consider the 



DETERMINATION OF VOLATILE FATTY ACIDS. 109 

mean of the two results as correct. At present the modifica- 
tion given by Wollny (Milchzeitung, 1887) is almost universally 
adopted ; in the author's words it runs as follows : 

5 f/rm. of butter melted out, decanted off clear from the sediment 
and filtered, are weighed into a flask containing 300 cc. (round 
form) ; length of neck, 7 to 8 cm,. ; width of neck, 2 cm. ; 2 cc. of soda- 
lye at 50 per cent, which have been preserved and measured with 
exclusion of carbonic acid and 10 cc. of alcohol (96 per cent, by 
volume) are added, and the mixture is heated with a reflux condenser 
($ 214) on a boiling-water bath, occasionally moving the flask. The 
alcohol is then distilled off from a closed flask, whereby the latter must 
lie for at least half an hour in a boiling- water bath, and then 100 cc. of 
distilled water are introduced by means of a pipette into the flask, 
which must then lie for a quarter of an hour longer in the water-bath, 
protected against the access of carbonic acid, so that the soap is com- 
pletely dissolved. The clear solution of soap is then at once and 
whilst at a boiling heat neutralised with 40 cc. sulphuric acid, from 30 
to 35 cc. of which neutralise 2 cc. of the soda-lye employed (25 cc. mono- 
hydrated sulphuric acid to 1 litre of water) ; two fragments of pumice 
of the size of a pea are added, and the flask is at once connected to the 
refrigerator. For this purpose there is used a glass tube 0*7 cm. wide, 
which at 1 cm. above the cork is blown out to a ball of 2 to 2 '5 cm. 
in diameter, and immediately above the ball is bent obliquely 
upwards at an obtuse angle, runs on in this direction about 5 cw., 
and is then bent obliquely downwards at an obtuse angle. It is con- 
nected with the refrigerator by means of a caoutchouc tube, not too 
narrow. When this has taken place the mixture in the flask is heated 
without boiling until the insoluble fatty acids are melted to a clear 
transparent mass ; then, within half an hour, exactly 110 cc. are distilled 
off into a measuring-flask, the distillate is mixed by shaking, and 100 cc. 
are filtered off into a measuring-flask. From this latter vessel they are 
poured into a beaker, 1 cc. phenolphthaleine solution (0'5 grm. to 1 litre 
alcohol at 50 per cent.) added, and titrated with decinormal baryta- 
water. When a red coloration appears the contents of the beaker are 
poured back into the flask, the liquid again decolorised is returned to 
the beaker and mixed with a few drops until a red colour becomes just 
visible. (The experiment is to be decided by a single drop.) 

From the number of cubic centimetres consumed and multiplied 
by 1*1, that number must be deducted which has resulted from a blank 
experiment (without fat), conducted exactly in the same manner, and 
which must not exceed 0.33. 

Explanations. There are first about from 50 to 80 grm. of butter 
taken from different parts of the sample, melted in a -capsule on 
the water- bath (not over a free flame), and filtered by means of a hot- 
water funnel. If in the filtrate a watery liquid collects below the hot 
butter-fat, the supernatant fat is poured clear into another capsule and 
stirred with a glass rod whilst cooling. Of this we weigh by means of 



i io BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

the same glass rod exactly 5 grm. into each of the flasks of prescribed 
size, previously dried with care, saponify with the alcoholic soda-lye, 
expel the alcohol exactly as prescribed to frustrate the formation of 
esters, and exclude the introduction of carbonic acid, as the latter would 
hrst l>e absorbed by the excess of lye, then liberated by the sulphuric 
acid like the fatty acids, and on titration might require an extra con- 
sumption of lye. The pieces of pumice render an equable distillation 
possible without bumping. 

Besides the volatile fatty acids, properly so called, higher fatty acids 
;ire carried over into the distillate along with the hot vapours ; they 
float on the surface like eyes, and may be removed by nitration. The 
longer the distillation is continued the more of these higher fatty acids 
are carried over. 

As the Wollny modification of the Reichert-Meissl process 
is coming more generally into use both in Germany and 
abroad, it is advisable to work on this method only, as the 
results obtained by other processes do not admit of com- 
parison. 

6. Determination of the Specific Gravity. 

311. This may be effected by means of the Westphal 
balance exactly as in 20. The determination is effected 
either at 35 or 100. In the latter a peculiar sinking 
appendage is needed, and the cylinder for the fat is set in a 
boiling-water bath, closed above, the fumes being conducted 
away. Konig lias prepared especial areometers for testing at 
300, the scale of which extends from 0'S55 to Q-870.

From 10 to 20 per cent, of the three last fats may be 
detected in butter by the specific gravity with tolerable 
certainty. 

7. Determination of the Melting-point. 

312. A glass tube having thin sides is drawn out at 
one part ; the thin part thus produced is bent upwards (a), 
and the tube is connected by means of a small piece of, 



DETERMINATION OF THE MELTING-POINT. 



in 



Caoutchouc pipe (d) with a thermometer (c). At the place 
where the contraction begins a little of the solid fat, which 
must have been congealed for at least forty-eight hours and 
kept in a cold place, is applied to the side of the glass by 
means of a platinum loop ; the thermometer with the small 
tube is held in a beaker of cold water, which is slowly heated 
over a small flame, whilst the thermometer is constantly 
moved. When the fat begins to flow down the side of the 
glass we note down the " begin- 
ning of melting," whilst as the 
" final point of melting " we take 
the moment when the turbid drop 
of fat flowing down becomes per- 
fectly clear. 

In the same manner Bensemann de- 
termines the initial and final points of 
the fusion of fatty acids insoluble in 
water. For their production 5 grm. 
oil or fat are saponified by boiling with 
2 grm. caustic potassa in 25 grm. alco- 
hol, heated on the water-bath with 
250 grm. water until the alcohol is 
completely expelled, when the soap is 
decomposed by an excess of hydro- 
chloric acid. On further heating the 
free fatty acids form a clear supernatant 

stratum, which after congealation is washed upon a well-moistened 
filter, first with cold, then with ^ litre of boiling water, and dried at from 
90 to at most 100 until the weight has become constant. These fatty 
acids also must have been left for a long time in the cold before they 
are fit for an exact determination of the melting-point. 

As examples of the results of the method I may quote Bense- 
mann (Repert.f. Analyt. C/iemie, 1884, iv. 167, and 1886, vi. 202).

This method, as far as the fatty acids insoluble in water 
are concerned, is suitable for oils and other fats. The cor- 
rection of the numbers found with reference to the length 
of the mercurial thread projecting outside of the bulb is 
generally omitted. For the method of executing such cor- 
rections and other points to be kept in view in the most 
delicate determinations, see Reissert (Berichte der Dcutsch. 
C/iem. GeselL, 1890, p. 2239). 

8. Examination for Free Fatty Acids. 

313. Eecent fats of all kinds contain, along with the 
neutral triglycerides (glycerine esters) of the fatty acids, only 
minimum quantities of free fatty acids. If, on keeping, such 
free acids appear in large quantities, we call the fat, which 
1ms then an unpleasant taste and smell, rancid. The cause 
of rancidity consists of the following factors : 

1. The oxygen of the air combines with the fats (Duclaux, 
Ritsert), but only during the simultaneous action of sun- 
1 iglit, forming, according to Duclaux, oxy-f atty acids ; accord- 
ing to Bonzynski and Rufi, free oleic acid. 

2. The activity of bacteria splits up fats. Hitherto no 
such bacteria are accurately known, but the greater durability 
of salted butter and the efficacy of other preservative agents 
seem to prove the joint action of bacteria, which was formerly 
enormously over-estimated (see 316). 

3. Lastly, we find in the seeds of plants ferments capable 
of splitting up plants, and which, on prolonged keeping, 
come into activity (Siegmund). 

For determining the degree of rancidity, 50 grin, of the fat, 
which has been melted and decanted off clear, must be dis- 
solved in about 50 cc. of ether, a few drops of an alcoholic 
solution of phenolphthaleine are added, and normal alcoholic 
potassa-lye l is added until a violet colour begins to appear. 

1 Alcoholic normal potassa-lye is obtained by dissolving about 60 yrm. 
caustic potassa in 1 litre alcohol at 96 per cent. It is ascertained by titration 
with normal sulphuric acid how much more alcohol must be added to 
rectify the strength. Does not keep long, but turns slowly to a darker brown. 
Holde (Konigl. Versuchs anstalt, Berlin) dissolves the caustic soda in alcohol 
at 50 per cent., as such a solution keeps better (Chemiker Zeitung Rep., 1889, 
p. 340). 



EXAMINATION FOR COLOURING SUBSTANCES. 113 

According to Kottsdorfer we say the fat has as many degrees 
of rancidity as cubic centimetres of normal potassa-lye are 
required to neutralise 100 grm. of fat. According to Besana, 
the more modest appellation, degrees of acidity, is more 
accurate (see 317). 

The method has latterly undergone various modifications. 
Besana, e.g., extracts 10 grm. of oil three times with 45 cc. of 
alcohol at 95 per cent., and titrates the decanted alcoholic 
extracts with aqueous decinormal soda-lye. I have never 
experienced difficulties with the older, simple method. 

9. Examination for Preservative Agents. 

| 314. In addition to common salt boric acid and salicylic 
acid are sometimes used. Salicylic acid can be shaken out 
from the melted butter with a solution of sodium bicarbonate 
as a sodium salt, and may then be separated from the fat by 
filtration. Boric acid may be extracted in hot water. (For 
details, see 227 and 231.) 

10. Examination for Colouring Substances. 

315. The public, it is alleged, require yellow butter the 
whole year through. Butter, however, has a decided yellow 
colour only whilst the cattle consume green fodder. Hence, 
unfortunately, the custom of colouring the butter has become 
very general. Thus it is supposed that a satisfactory guar- 
antee is afforded for the constant uniformity of the butter. 
Latterly the fashion of colouring butter is again declining. 

The chief colouring substances used are : 1. Annatto = Orleans = 
benefit (!) = carottine. A reddish-brown substance of intense tinc- 
torial strength, obtained from tlie fruits of Bixa orellana. Met with in 
trade either as a watery paste or dissolved in oil. 2. Saffron, generally 
sophisticated with safflower, marigolds, or with other substances (see 
363). 3. Turmeric, a yellow powder from the roots of Curcuma longa 
and rotunda. 4. Juice of carrots (Daucus car otto). 5. For colours see 
next page. 

All colouring-matters may be detected by shaking up the melted and 
filtered butter with a mixture of fifteen parts of methylic alcohol 1 

1 Not methylated spirit. Editor. 
VOL. II. H 



ii 4 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

and two parts of carbon disulphide. The fat dissolves in the carbon 
disulphide and separates out, whilst the methylic alcohol floats above 
it. The latter takes up very freely the colouring-matters of annatto, 
saffron, and turmeric ; little of the colouring-matter of carrots passes 
into the methylic alcohol, as it is very soluble in carbon disulphide, 
whence in this case the fatty stratum remains coloured. 

A differential diagnosis of the several colours is not quite easy. 
Among the reactions laid down in the literature of the subject the 
following seem useful. The methylic alcohol drawn off with the 
syphon is evaporated down in small portions in porcelain capsules on 
the water-bath, and touched with one drop of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. Annatto, saffron, and carrot turn to a dark blue, more or less 
inclining to green ; the tone of the colour is somewhat varied, and is 
much affected by the purity of the isolation. Saffron may be detected 
by its odour, even if present only in very small quantities. Turmeric 
is turned to a violet-red by concentrated sulphuric acid, and, in contra- 
distinction to the other colouring-matters, which are scarcely, if at all, 
affected, it is turned brown by alkalies. Marigold behaves like carrot. 
The colouring-matter of samower and the aniline colours possibly used : 
dinitrocresol ammonium, potassium, or calcium (saffron substitute, 
Victoria yellow), aniline yellow (naphthol yellow S), Martins yellow 
(naphthol yellow) have few characteristic reactions, but they also colour 
methylic alcohol. For further details see 495 a. See also Martin 
(Ghem. Zeit. Repertorium, 1887, p. 132), Leeds (Chem. Zeit. Repertorium, 
1887, p. 188), Stebbins (Ckern. Zeit. Repertorium, 1887, p. 232). 

ii. Bacteriological Examination. 

316. According to Lafar (Arcliiv f. Hygiene, xiii.), in the 
quantitative determination of the bacteria of butter, the best 
procedure is as follows : We introduce into 100 cc. of sterilised 
water about O'l to 0'3 gnu. of butter, shake it well round 
after the water has been heated to 38-40 (not previously), 
and obtain thus a fine emulsion, of which quantities of from 
0'05 to 0'5 are used for making up several plate-cultures. 
Butter is always very rich in microbia, the surface always 
more than the interior. Hence a layer of 1 cm. in thickness 
is always removed before taking the specimens. Lafar found 
in fresh butter in the interior on an average 10 to 20 million 
bacteria per gramme ; amongst these were regularly two 
optionally anrcrobic short rods, one of them not liquefying : 
PMC. lutyri colloidcus, capable of growing luxuriant and 
slimy upon gelatine and agar and upon potato, approximat- 
ing to the typhus bacillus, and the other liquefying, and in 



DECISION UPON BUTTER. 115 

its cultivations resembling the hay bacillus, but fluorescent, 
named Sac. fluorescens butyri, and perhaps in part the cause 
of the aroma of butter. 

The sterilising of butter can be effected neither by salts nor 
by cold. If oxygen is excluded no rancidity is occasioned, in 
spite of the abundant presence of the optionally anasrobic 
Bac. butyri colloideus. Laser (Zdt. /. Hygiene, x.) never failed 
to find in butter Oidium lactis either microscopically or by 
culture ; it was especially easy to find in the caseine which 
separates out of butter at a brood- temperature (1 loopful 
yielded from twenty-five colonies to an innumerable swarm). 
Laser proposes to utilise its occurrence as a reagent for the 
presence of small quantities of butter. For staining these 
butter-organisms the method of Arens is excellent ( 285). 

B. Kriiger found (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, vii. No. 14) that a 
growth of bacteria scarcely occurs upon melted butter, at least as far 
as the aerobic species are concerned. In "cheesy butter/' badly 
washed, yellow and ill-smelling, he found a series of schizomycetes 
and saccharomycetes, one of the latter, Saccharomycetes flavus lactis, 
determining the yellow coloration. 

Bang killed animals by dietetic tuberculosis on feeding them witli 
butter obtained from the milk of cows suffering from tuberculosis 
of the udder. Other explorers have demonstrated a transmission of the 
bacilli of tubercle into cream and milk.

A butter of a good quality should not contain more than 



ii6 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

15 per cent, of not-fat; that with more than 20 per cent, is 
not marketable (Agreements of the Bavarian chemists). 
Butter abounding in water is low in its nutritive value, 
insipid ; if it is spread upon bread, water or butter-milk 
oozes out, which is not appetising. 

The proportion of salt in salt butter rarely exceeds 2 to 
2i- per cent., as even if 4 per cent, of salt is added a large 
part of the salt remains behind in the water in which 
it is kneacled up. The German navy does not accept as 
"keeping butter" any quality which contains more than 
3 1 per cent, of common salt. Yieth is not inclined to 
sanction more than 2 per cent. Further means of preserva- 
tion except thorough washing (to eliminate butter-milk rich 
in microbia), the addition of salt and a low temperature, seem 
unnecessary for short preservation ; butter for eating should 
be quite fresh ; for the preservation of butter for voyages 
wo may. in case of need, permit the addition of small quan- 
tities of boric or salicylic acid (of course with a formal 
declaration) if the means above-mentioned fail. I may pro- 
nounce this ono of the cases where our present chemical 
means of preservation, cautiously applied, are admissible, 
especially as such preservative agents may be easily washed 
out before consumption. 

Colouring butter, if well-prepared, sound, harmless vege- 
table colours annatto, 1 saffron, carrots, &c. are used, is 
hygienically unexceptionable, but scarcely makes the product 
more appetising. It is conceivable that butter may be 
rendered unwholesome by rancid colouring-matters in the 
course of putresceiit decomposition. The use of poisonous 
colours. c.</., dinitrocresol-potassiuin would be exceedingly 
likely to injure health (see 457). ~\Ve must strongly ap- 
prove of the point of view adopted by the United States that 
every artificially coloured butter is to be legally regarded as 
artificial butt or.

DECISION UPON BUTTER. 117 

The mixture of butter with foreign fats 1 may be detected by 
the Keichert-Meissl-Wollny method, since all other fats con- 
tain smaller quantities of volatile fatty acids. Meissl required 
that the volatile fatty acids from 5 grm. of fat should con- 
sume at least 26 cc. of lye. Sendtner (Arch. f. Hygiene, i. 
p. 140) seeks to establish twenty-four. Recent Italian in- 
vestigations have found lower values. Besana, who has pub- 
lished the most numerous analyses (114), found by Wollny's 
modification 21*8 to 30 '2, Spallanzani in seventy analyses 
even 20'63 to 30'6 (Ghem. Zeit. Rep., 1889, p. 309). 

Beef fat, consumes only . . . 0'70 cc. 

Hog's lard ... 0'90 

Margarine ,, . . . 1*98 
Vegetable fats . from 0*6 to 1-0 

Cocoa-nut fat 0*7 to 0'9 



From these numbers it appears that an approximately 
accurate determination of the foreign fat added is not 
possible. To butter with an accidentally very high propor- 
tion of volatile fatty acids, large quantities of other fats may 
be added until the minimum value is reached. 

If butter is burnt during melting it undergoes a loss of volatile acids. 
Such butter cannot be judged by the proportion of fatty acids. The 
conclusion of hygiene concerning the addition of foreign fats to butter 
lias been already denned ( 310). 

Butter tastes and smells the more unpleasantly the more 
free fatty acids it contains. 

According to Stockmeier (Bericht liber die viii. Versammlnng Bayer. 
Cliem. in Wiirzburg, 1889), to which we are indebted for the most 
thoroughgoing information, fat quite free from acids has an insipid 
taste ; fresh butter lias from two to five degrees of rancidity ; a ran- 
cidity of from five to six degrees is slightly unpleasant to smell and 
taste. Stockmeier met witli 110 persons to whom butter of eight 
degrees of rancidity was other than unpleasant. After the use of such 
a product there sometimes occurs a feeling of discomfort, eructations, 
heart-burn, &c. ; in two attacks of illness of this nature, after a moderate 

1 According to Huggenberg all the samples purchased as good, pure butter 
at Chemnitz contained from 60 to 70 per cent, of foreign fat (Chem. 
Zcitung, 1886). 



ii8 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

use of butter, the same author detected a rancidity of 12 and 13 '7 
degrees. Melted butter-fat becomes rancid only very slowly. Cold fats 
of the same degree of rancidity taste less rancid than if hot. In winter 
rancid butter is much more readily sold without suspicion than in 
summer. The materials hitherto available are certainly in need of 
decided extension ; but it is still, according to our present knowledge, 
probable that butter with from eight to ten degrees of rancidity and 
upwards may occasionally prove injurious to health. 

According to Besana (Chemiker Zeituny, 1891, p. 410), the unpleasant 
rancid taste is not always proportional to the acidity. He found 
strongly rancid butter unfit for use with only 2'8 degrees of acidity, 
consequently other substances must also come into play. Quite similar 
results have been published by B. Fischer (Jahresberickt dtr Chemischcn 
UntersucJiunysstation der Stadt Breslau, 1891). Here butter with five 
degrees of acidity was several times found unpleasant, whilst once 
15 'of) degrees of acidity did not appear rancid to the taste. 

Further investigations of a toxicological character are here necessary. 

Heavy Metals. Copper, lead, and tin in butter are to be 
judged not differently than if they were met with in other 
substances. If hot rancid fat is allowed especially to stand 
in copper vessels there is formed a fatty salt of copper with a 
green colour. Minimal quantities of copper are sufficient to 
produce a strong coloration of the fat, so that for the detec- 
tion of copper it has been recommended to shake up an acidu- 
lated liquid and pour in a little oil. 

The common assumption that the salts of copper, with the 
fatty acids, are more poisonous than other salts of copper is 
a fable (K. B. Lehmann). See 484. 

Milk containing pathogenic bacteria may yield a similar 
butter (compare 301). 



APPENDIX L MARGARLXK AND ARTIFICIAL 
BUTTER. 

r>18. Margarine, 1 formerly known as "artificial butter," 
is a substitute for butter introduced into trade and prepared 
in different methods. 

The best method (MJge-Mourids) proceeds as follows : Fresh beef-fat 
(especially from the kidneys and omentum) is washed, chopped up 



1 Margarine is the name officially introduced as the name for substitutes 
for butter since July 12, 1887. 



MARGARINE AND ARTIFICIAL BUTTER. 119 

finely, melted at 50, poured off from the non-fat, let cool at 24, when 
the tristearine separates out in a crystalline state. The more easily 
liquefied trioleine and tripalmitine (called jointly oleomargarine) 
yield if churned up with water, milk, and a little butter-colour ( 315), 
after salting and washing, a preparation of a butter-like taste, de- 
cidedly appetising. 

The examination is conducted as for butter; to facilitate 
the control the law of the German empire prohibits the sale 
of margarine which contains more than, an equal weight of 
milk, or more than 10 per cent, of cream. 

Artificial butter at 100 has the specific gravity of 0*859 
to 0-861, or at 35, 0'9019; according to Reichert-Meissl 
only about 2 cc. of decinormal lye are consumed for 5 grm. 

Hygiene has nothing to object to a product prepared 
exactly according to the above directions ; it is not yet even 
proved with certainty that it is less fully utilised in the diges- 
tive organs than is butter. An addition of vegetable oils (oil 
of arachis, nut-oil, cotton-seed oil), as it is customary in many 
places, cannot be regarded as injurious to health. If, indeed, 
the fat of diseased animals (see Meat), fat from the establish- 
ments of knackers, or old, stale fat is used, if the margarine 
is not prepared with the utmost cleanliness, if flesh and con- 
nective tissue are not carefully removed from the preparation, 
if poisonous colours are used, &c., margarine may be harm- 
ful : products thus prepared are loathsome, and are uncon- 
ditionally to be objected to. 

In order to recognise an addition of margarine to cow- 
butter, Soxhlet has proposed to mix with all artificial butter 
small quantities of colourless phenolphthaleine, about 1 grm. 
to 100 Ib. 

If such butter is incorporated with natural butter, on melt- 
ing the butter with a little water and adding some soda, the 
mass turns to a rose or a violet colour. For daily practice 
the ash of cigars may be substituted for soda. There is no 
hygienic objection to this proposal. 1 



1 The sale of margarine under its own name is perfectly free in Britain, a 
restriction which is much resented by the trade. In most other European 
countries the law is similar. Editor. 



120 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 



APPENDIX II. FOOD FATS. 

319. Among animal fats, along with butter and marga- 
rine, the following are extensively used for human consump- 
tion : hog's lard, beef-fat (especially that from the kidneys), 
and goose-grease. Among vegetable fats the principal are : 
the oil of olives, poppy-seed, beech-nuts, earth-nuts, sesame, 
walnuts, sun-flowers, cotton-seed ; of late the consumption 
of purified cocoa-nut fat for food is constantly extending, 
a practice decidedly to be approved of. 

We cannot here enter closely into the diagnosis of these substances ; 
the detection of cheaper adulterants in the more expensive kinds is 
often very difficult, and not always certain. As general methods for 
investigation may be mentioned : 

1. Determination of the specific gravity, 311. 

Determination of the melting and solidifying points of the fat 

and of its fatty acids, ^13. 

3. Determination of the quantity of iodine which the non-saturated 
fatty acids (oleic acid) in the mixture are capable of combining 
with (Hiibl's iodine number). 

At the same time the odour, the taste, and especially for cotton-seed 
oil the colour reactions play an important part. 

Whilst for all further details I refer to the special literature 
of the subject mentioned below, I mention the following 
methods of examination for certain coarser frauds. 

1. Examination for Proportion of Water and for Additions of Inorganic 
Substances in Solid Fats. All food fats should be free from water, i.e., 
when melted they should form perfectly clear liquids. The proportion 
of water may be found approximately by setting a weighed quantity of 
fat for some time in a graduated cylinder in warm water. Any 
particles of tissues, which are scarcely likely to be present, subside to 
the bottom along with the water, as also any heavy-spar, gypsum, talc, 
&c. &c., which may have possibly been added, forming thus an aqueous 
and above this a fatty stratum. 

If soaps are present, which are sometimes intentionally produced by 
adding lye to the fat in order to give it the power of taking up more 
water, the fat and the water separate from each other very imperfectly. 
We proceed then and indeed always, unless we aim at merely approxi- 
mate correctness as for butter (desiccation upon sand). 

'2. Examination for the Addition of "Mineral Fats." Liquid and 
semi-solid hydrocarbons (vaseline, paraffine oil, &c., which are therefore 
not fats at all) have often been used for the adulteration of fats in 
quantities up to 33 per cent. They may be detected by boiling 10 grin. 



FOOD FATS. 121 

fat with about 10 cc. of strong potassa-lye and 50 cc. alcohol, until the 
solution is perfectly clear. If the alcohol is completely evaporated off 
in the water-bath the soap which has been formed must form a per- 
fectly clear solution in the water ; any portion which remains undih- 
solved consists of a mineral oil, which may be separated from the soap 
by nitration through a wet filter, or by means of a parting-funnel. 
The paraffine may be further purified by dissolving in petroleum ether, 
filtering, and evaporating oft* the solvent. 

3. Examination for Rancidity and the Addition of Soap. If recent 
animal fat is shaken up with an equal volume of warm spirit and a 
little water is added to the liquid when cold, the reaction is rarely 
neutral, generally faintly acid, seldom strongly acid. The degree of 
rancidity is determined by titration as in butter. If the extract with 
warm alcohol has an alkaline reaction, lyes have been added and soap 
has been formed. For the certain detection of soap the melted fat must 
be shaken out with hot water, the solution of soap formed must be 
separated from the fat when cold, the fatty acids separated by means of 
sulphuric acid, dried and weighed, and the alkalies determined in the 
filtrate. 

320. Every fat of abnormal smell, taste, colour, 1 and 
consistence, until the true cause of the appearance is de- 
tected, must be regarded as suspicious. American lard, 
pressed out of bacon which has been treated with super- 
heated steam, is smeary, soft, but not injurious. 

The nutrient value and the wholesomeness of all the ani- 
mal and most of the vegetable fats is approximately alike ; ' 2 
the presence of water reduces it, and it must therefore be 
objected to in all fats except butter. Soap, or the addition 
of lye, as a means for introducing water or less valuable fats, 
is to be condemned. A derangement of health by propor- 
tions too small to be detected by the taste is improbable; 
larger quantities of soap, as is well known, excite vomit- 
ing. The thought of consuming soap is disgusting to most 
persons. The rancidity of animal fats might be determined 
like that of butter (317). I found in three samples of 

1 Kyll has observed green spots on btitter owing to the harmless Pleura- 
coccus vulyaris. It has a disgusting aspect. 

3 The sparing fusible fats are imperfectly utilised, e.g., mutton fat. Com- 
pare Chocolate. In Portugal the incredible falsification of olive-oil with the oil 
from the seeds of the euphorbia ceous tree, Jatropha curcas, which are more 
drastic than castor-oil, is said to have occurred. Hiepe (Rep. der Anal. Chemie, 
1885). 



122 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

good olive-oil, supplied by respectable firms, 2*1, 44, and 54 
degrees of rancidity; in two cheap "food oils," from small 
shops, 9-0 and 10'6. 

Poisonous goose-grease has been described by Siedler 
(Franks' Mayaz., ii. p. 588). Its action was evidently due to 
ptomaines. According to Eisner, the fat of geese which have 
died of disease is of a sweetish, repulsive smell and taste. 

Vaseline and other mineral oils are quite incapable of 
absorption ; they therefore constitute at least worthless 
ballast for the digestive organs. In England some cases of 
violent illness have occurred in children, with intestinal 
symptoms, after the ingestion of vaseline, mixed with sugar, 
for a catarrh of the organs of respiration. Shepter Robinson 
(Brit. Mcd. Journal, 1886, p. 296), and Vincent (Brit. Heel 
Journal, 1886, p. 543).

CHEESE. 123 



II. CHEESE. 

321. All the varieties of cheese, about 150 in number, 
differing in part fundamentally among themselves, are ob- 
tained from milk. The following may serve as an outlined 
classification : 

I. Rennet or Sweet Milk Cheese. The caseine is precipitated from 
sweet milk by means of rennet (the ferment of the abomasum of 
calves) : 

1. Cream-cheese, or super-fatty cheese, obtained from cream or from 

new milk to which cream has been added, in which the per- 
centage of fat is decidedly greater than that of caseine. 

2. Fat cheese, from new milk, the proportions of fat and of caseine 

being more or less equal. 

3. Semi-fat cheese made from partially skimmed evening milk and 

new morning milk in equal parts. 

4. Lean cheese made from milk entirely or partially skimmed ; tlie 

proportion of fat considerably below that of caseine. 

II. Sour Milk Cheese. The caseine is precipitated from sour milk on 
heating by the lactic acid. 

III. Whey Cheese. The albuminous matter which remains in the 
whey after Process I. is obtained by careful evaporation. 

Group I. comprises by far the most numerous and most important 
sorts, that is, among soft cheeses ; Limburg cheese and the various 
cream cheeses used as luxuries ; among hard cheeses the Emmenthal, 
the Algauer, North German, English and Dutch sorts, are all rennet 
cheeses. Group II. includes fresh curd- and hand-cheeses ; Group III. 
plays no part in the markets of the world. 

It is comprehensible that the proportions of fat, of albu- 
menoids, and of water fluctuate enormously, according to 
the manner of preparing cheese ; in addition, there are im- 
portant differences involved in the ripening and storage with 
the co-operation of various bacteria, &c. The holes in cheese 
are produced by the development of carbonic acid. 

It must further be mentioned that to many sorts, such as 
Gorgonzola, Koquefort, Stilton, the spores of moulds are 
intentionally added ; the greenish tracts in these cheeses are 
mould-vegetations hitherto imperfectly studied botanically. 
Schabzieger cheese (herb-cheese) receives a flavouring addi- 
tion of Melilotus coerulea ; occasionally other spices are added, 
e.g., cloves. 



124 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

Careful bacteriological studies on cheese, and especially on its ripen- 
ing process, have been made by Adametz and Von Freudenreich (sec 
Bibliography). In 1 grm. of household cheese there were found 8^ 
millions of bacteria on an average, and in 1 grm. of ripe Emmenthaler 
a mean of 5^ millions (Adametz) ; in older cheeses, according to Von 
Freudenreich, often only 100,000 ; a number of species, chiefly aerobic, 
have been isolated and described. It would not be legitimate to enter 
more closely into this subject, as these preliminary studies are scarcely 
yet available for hygienic practice. Very recently Von Freudenreich has 
proved that the microbia which occasion inflammation of the udder 
if introduced into milk produce cheese which occasions flatulence 
(Bacillus Guillebeau a, b, c). Adametz and Weigmann have furnished 
strict proof that the formation of holes in cheese in general is occasioned 
by bacterin. Numerous quite recent investigations are occupied with 
further studies on the bacteriologic causes of the defects of cheese. 



A. Examination of Cheese. 

822. Taking samples. Of smaller sorts of cheese we 
take the entire piece ; of larger kinds, e.g., Emmenthaler, we 
take a section tapering like a wedge from the margin to the 
centre, and after carefully removing the rind we comminute 
it, according to its consistence, either with a rasp or in a 
mortar, so as to obtain a perfectly uniform mixture, which 
for most rapidly obtaining portions for the several determina- 
tions is kept at a low temperature in a vessel fitted with 
a glass stopper. 

The water, or the dry substance, is determined as directed 
for milk; from 2 to 3 grm. of the sample are dried at 100, 
along with 30 grm. of sand (previously ignited), until the 
weight becomes constant. The quantity of the volatile fatty 
acids, or of the ammonium compounds which escape along 
with the water, is so trifling that, according to Sartori, it may 
be safely neglected. 1 

The fat 2 is obtained by extracting the dry substance with 

1 An examination with the senses furnishes experienced persons, but only 
such, with important data for a decision. 

2 To prove an addition of foreign fats, the fat must be extracted from 
about 40 yrm. of cheese, the ether evaporated, and the fat further examined 
as directed for butter ( 317). At present cheese is obtained from whizzed 
milk, to which margarine or vegetable oils have been added in place of the 
natural fat which has been removed (so-called artificial cheese). 



DECISION UPON CHEESE. 125 

ether according to 214. Along with fat the etherial ex- 
tract contains small quantities of free fatty acids, which may 
be determined, like butter, by titration (313), as also lactic 
acid, especially in new cheese. Fatty acids combined with 
alkalies are left behind in the cheese. Their determination 
is not generally effected. The proportion of nitrogen is 
determined in a specimen freed from fat, but it is not re- 
calculated as albumen, since cheese contains considerable 
quantities of amides, lecithin, nuclein, and other nitrogenous 
" non-albumen." 

The ash is determined in 5 grm. of cheese, and further examination 
as directed for butter. Traces of copper are found in many cheeses ; 
lead occurs in cheese enveloped in plumbiferous tinfoil. The presence 
of chalk, gypsum, soil (in Gorgonzola) is readily detected by an analysis 
of the ash. 

Colouring-matters are used as for butter, but not to the same extent 
as formerly. 

An addition of starch could be easily detected by means of iodine. 
Crushed boiled potatoes are occasionally stirred into cheap "curd- 
cheese." It is alleged that cheese is sometimes rubbed over with urine 
to give it a piquant flavour ; the detection would be easily effected by 
extracting the rind with sodium carbonate, and testing the nitrate for 
uric acid ( 197 a). 

Certain characters for the detection of unwholesome 
cheeses are wanting ; but when the smell and the taste differ 
from those of the sort in question, there is room for great 
suspicion. Cheese, however, has had a poisonous action, 
though presenting no remarkable properties. Sertuerner has 
described various cases of cheese-poisoning. 

B. Decision upon Cheese. 

| 323. The chemical composition gives a decision on the 
nutritive value ; in consequence of their high proportion of 
albumen at a cheap price, the half-fatty cheeses rank among 
our most valuable foods. 

Unwholesome adulterations occur very rarely, and do not 
require any especial consideration. Concerning colouring- 
matters what has been said of butter applies here also. The 
superficial staining with Croton tindorium and magenta, 



126 BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

commonly practised in Holland, is unimportant if the 
magenta is free from arsenic. Concerning the heavy metals 
see Butter ( 317). 

Cheese must be pronounced disgusting when it not merely 
displays small plots of mould on the surface, but is pervaded 
within and without with distinctly recognisable mould vege- 
tations. The vegetations in Roquefort, &c., not recognised 
by the outside public as mould, are not to be hygienically 
objected to. Cheese is also disgusting when it is inhabited 
by great numbers of dipterous larvae, if it has a putrid 
smell, is abnormally soft (deliquescent), or displays recent 
fermentation. 

A more definite account of the changes in poisonous cheese 
is to be expected from thorough bacteriological-chemical 
researches. In the meantime we must be satisfied with a 
strict rejection of all cheese which excites in our senses even 
the most remote suspicion of unwholesomeness, as certain 
characters which point to the presence of cheese-poison are 
wanting. Injurious cheese has been repeatedly distinguished 
by a remarkable smell and taste (strong acidity, musty taste, 
remarkable softness, brick-like colour, a sharp taste). 
"Brick-cheese," and other soft cheeses, are more frequently 
poisonous than hard cheese. Tyrotoxicon, which has been 
repeatedly found in poisonous cheese in America, is sought 
for in a crushed or comminuted portion ( 298) ; for the 
detection of other ptomaines see 79 a. Tyrotoxicon is highly 
poisonous. 

Black cheese (F. J. Her/, Milclwitunrj, 1880, p. 498 and Hueppe, I. c. 
1880, p. 059), occasioned by the development of a black saccharomycete, 
is harmless but repulsive. Blue cheese is said to occur frequently in 
Holstein, and notwithstanding its unappetising, blue-stained colour and 
its greyish-bine spots, it is consumed without injury (Von Klenxe, 
see Bibliography). Hitherto the careless use of iron implements has 
been considered a main cause of this defect. Recently De Vries has 
detected in blue Edam cheese motionless bacteria, not yet closely 
described, which generate a colouring-matter only in the absence of air 
(Milch:. eitung, 1888, Nos. 44 and 45). 

Artificial cheese, injurious to health, has not yet been observed ; its 
nutritive value will be equal to that of natural cheese similar in com- 
position ; its relishing quality generally leaves much to be desired.

SECTION X. 
FLOUR AND BREAD 1 

324. In our districts only wheat, spelt, and rye play an 
important part as bread-stuffs. In mountainous regions and 
in northern countries there are used also barley, oats, and 
buckwheat ; and in the south, maize, rice, and several sorts of 
millet. 2 Buckwheat and rice do not yield bread, but only 
porridge, &c. 

With us, along with Triticum xnhjare, several species belonging to 
the genus Triticum are cultivated, although to a less extent : Triticum 
durum, especially grown in the south of Europe, yields hard grain, 
very rich in gluten, and is used for the manufacture of maccaroni ; 
Triticum turgidwn, cultivated especially in England and Holland, yields 
a Hour rich in starch, poor in gluten, and therefore bad to bake; 
Triticum dicoccum, and Triticnm inonoc<>ccum. In these two kinds, as 
also in Triticum spclta, extensively grown in South Germany, the 
grains remain after thrashing inclosed in the gluma. 

Of rye (Sec ale cercale), rice (Oryza sa/'v'm), and maize (Indian corn or 
mealies, Z<'<i maus) only one species of each is cultivated, though there 
are several varieties. 

Buckwheat (Polygonum fagopyriim} is not a graminaceous plant, but 
belongs to the Polygonaceie. 

A. Examination of Flour. 

325. By flour we understand the product of grinding 
grains of wheat, freed from the seeds of weeds, from dirt, 
and from their own husks, between millstones or fluted 
rollers. 



1 Some complete analyses are given in Table IX. 

- In Britain rye is not now used for bread, and is cultivated only as green 
fodder for cattle. Next to wheat, oats are the commonest grain in the north 
of England and in Scotland. Barley is extensively used in North Africa and 

Western Asia. Editor.

CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 129 

In modern advanced milling a series of very different white floura 
are obtained from wheat, the whitest qualities being obtained from the 
interior of the grain. There are distinguished, e.g. 

00. Imperial select flour. 4. Flour for rolls. 

0. Select flour. 5. White pollards. 

1. and 2 Bakers' select. 6. ' Black pollards. 
3. Pastry flour. 7. Bran. 

Groats, grits, and dust are, in an ascending series, names for pre- 
liminary stages of flour. The waste-products of milling are used for 
feeding domestic animals. 

The finest wheat flours are poor in albumen (10 '1 per 
cent.), the coarsest contain from 13 to 16 per cent, of 
albumen, along with an abundant admixture of cellulose. 
The kind of wheat used is very important for the proportion 
of albumen. 

Eye flour is of a darker colour, and is not ground as finely 
as wheat. 

Admixtures of bran can be detected by spreading out the 
sample upon a dull, dark paper. The expert can estimate 
the degree of contamination with bran by the colour and 
the feel of the flour. The examination of flour involves the 
determination of the following points : 

1. Proportion of water, ash, albumenoids, and, if neces- 
sary, fats. 

2. Presence of foreign constituents : mineral powders, the 
seeds of weeds, diseased grain. 

3. Presence of products of decomposition, moulds, &c. 

i. Chemical Examination. 

326. Proportion of Water. We proceed exactly as 
directed in 209. 

Flour containing a normal amount of water, if pressed in 
the hand, forms a loose lump, which readily falls asunder ; 
damp flour clots in the sacks, and still more if pressed in the 
hand and keeps badly ( 332). 

Fat and Albumenoids. We proceed exactly according to 
214 and 211. 

The most important albumenoid substance of grain is gluten. 

VOL. II. I 



130 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

The baking property of flour depends on the proportion of gluten ; if 
it is too small, or if it has been modified by processes of decomposition 
from the germination of the grain, from too prolonged storage, or from 
having been kept in a room which had been sulphured, it may no 
longer be in condition to yield a compact dough which will rise well. 

A simple method determines the gluten in wheat (not in rye) accu- 
rately enough for practical purposes ; 50 grm. of flour are well mixed 
iu a capsule with an equal weight of water, and allowed to stand for 
thirty minutes to one hour. The paste is then collected in a fine linen 
cloth which is closed up in the form of a bag, and the paste is kneaded 
under the water flowing from a tap. The starch runs out in a milky 
suspension, whilst the gluten remains behind yellow, tough, and plastic. 
After some time the cloth is removed from the gluten thus approxi- 
mately purified, and the kneading is completed by hand until the 
water runs off clear. The fresh gluten, well pressed, ought to amount 
to 25 to 30 per cent, of the weight of good wheat flour fit for baking, 
or 12 to 15 per cent, when dried. Bad flour yields little, or dark 
coloured, slimy gluten, deficient in plasticity. 

The proportion of gluten is higher in richly nitrogenous wheats than 
in such as are poor in nitrogen, but the quantities are not proportional. 
Heinrich and Meyer (Centralblatt f. Agrikidtur-Chemie, 1890, p. 342) 
found a Danish sort with T84 per cent, nitrogen and 15 per cent, 
gluten ; and in a German sort, 1'50 per cent, nitrogen and 6'3 per cent, 
dry gluten. Rye yields no plastic gluten, but a deliquescent gluten 
which cannot be washed. 

Halenke and Moslinger, as they repeatedly obtained by washing the 
normal proportion of gluten from flour which did not bake well, 
recommend the following test. A paste is made up of 50 grm. flour 
and 25 grm. water, and laid underneath a glass bell. Bad baking flour 
often appears shiny in half an hour and begins to deliquesce, and 
after twelve hours the paste is quite melted away. 1 Paste from good 
flour is then still dry, firm, and elastic. I have no experience on the 
subject. 

The suitability for baking can be directly tested (both for rye flour 
and wheat flour) by measuring the expansion of a piece of dough on 
baking it in a tube rubbed over with oil in an oil-bath. The apparatus 
founded upon this principle is called the aleurometer. The tougher 
the gluten the better it retains the carbonic acid evolved, and the 
greater is its suitability for baking. 

A large addition of common salt renders it possible to bake bread of 
good appearance even from flour of bad quality. Alum, copper sul- 
phate, and lime-water have a similar effect. 

The proportion of cellulose may be accurately determined according 
tj the directions in 221. 



1 Formerly, when every family in the Xorth of England baked its own bread, 
the complaint was general after a cold, wet summer and autumn that "the 
dough ran away out of the oven." Editor. 



CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 131 

327. Ash 1 and Inorganic Additions. The quantitative 
determination is effected as in 210. Wheat and rye flour 
contain, according to their degree of fineness, from 0*5 to 
1-8 per cent, of ash; the proportion of ash is higher the 
more of the bran, which is rich in silica, is left in the flour ; 
from 0'5 to I'O is present in ordinary qualities. The flour of 
leguminous seeds contains from 2'5 to 3'3 per cent, of ash. 

If about 10 cc. chloroform, and then about 5 cc. of flour 
are put in a test-tube, which is covered with the thumb, 
shaken, and allowed to stand, the flour, which has about the 
same specific gravity as the chloroform, remains suspended, 
i.e., floating, whilst mineral matter present falls to the bottom 
as a whitish powder. Flour is rarely quite free from such 
matter (from the abrasion of the millstones and sand) ; but if 
the grain has been well cleansed and not sophisticated, a 
minimum quantity only should be found. If the deposit is 
large, a larger sample of flour is treated in the same manner, 
the sediment is collected by pouring off the meal and the 
chloroform, and examined as follows. There may occur : 2 

CaC0 3 = calcium carbonate, marble or chalk-powder. 

MgC0 3 + CaCOs = dolomite, a mixture of calcium and magnesium 
v y ' carbonate. 

CaS04 = calcium sulphate, gypsum. 

BaS0 4 = barium sulphate, heavy spar. 

Silica and calcium aluminium silicates. 

If the sediment effervesces with hydrochloric acid, CCb is present ; if 
it readily dissolves entirely, there aie merely carbonates, and perhaps 
a little calcium sulphate. Larger quantities of gypsum dissolve only 
on long boiling with much water or hydrochloric acid (or slowly in 
sodium bicarbonate in the cold) ; an addition of barium chloride to the 
hydrochloric solution reveals the sulphuric acid as white BaS(>4. If, 
after repeated energetic treatment with an excess of hot dilute hydro- 
chloric, there still remains an undissolved residue, it is heavy spar, which 
defies all solvents, or possibly quartz-powder or silicates. 

In order to decide whether magnesium or calcium has been dissolved 
in the hydrochloric acid in succession, they are tested for in succession 
according to 187. 

1 The ash of pure grain is rich in PaO 5 and potassa, poor in lime and sul- 
phuric acid. This is altered by an addition of gypsum. Traces of copper are 
always present (see Bread), Kassner once found 1 yrm. nickel per kilo grain. 

2 It may happen that the addition of copper or zinc sulphate or alurn, 
which in some places is very common in baking, is made to the flour. For 
detection see Bread. For lead, which may be derived from millstones care- 
lessly mended with lead, see 481. 



132 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

A residue insoluble in boiling hydrochloric acid, several times re- 
newed, which may be barium sulphate or silica, or a sparingly soluble 
silicate of calcium and aluminium, may be mixed dry in a finely 
powdered state, with pure anhydrous sodium carbonate, and melted 
together. There are formed BaS0 4 + Na 2 C0 3 = BaCO 3 + Na 2 SO4, if 
heavy spar is present. The melt is extracted with water to remove the 
NasS0 4 ; the BaCOs insoluble in water may be easily dissolved in HC1, 
and on adding dilute sulphuric acid to this solution insoluble BaSCX is 
reprecipitated. If it has not been previously boiled with HC1, and if 
CaS0 4 is still present, we have after fusion CaCOs along with BaC0 3 , 
and after dissolving the matter insoluble in water in HC1, we have 
CaCl 2 along witli BaCl 2 . A 25 per cent, solution of ammonium sul- 
phate precipitates here merely BaS0 4 ; the lime may be thrown down 
from the filtrate by means of ammonium oxalate and ammonia. 

If silicates were present there will be formed on fusion SiC^Xa.}, and 
SiO ; ;Na-2 sodium silicates, which are soluble in water ; on the addition of 
hydrochloric acid to the aqueous solution there is thrown down gela- 
tinous silica Si(OH)4 and Si0 3 H 2 , which,* on evaporation to dryness, 
m )istening with strong hydrochloric acid and reheating, is converted 
into the insoluble anhydride Si0 2 . 

2. Microscopic Examination of Flour for its Origin. 

328. Sophistication of wheat flour with rye flour does 
not occur ; bad wheat flour is sometimes used as a substitute 
for rye, barley waste has been ground up and added to other 
kinds of flour, but these are rather rare cases. Such substi- 
tutions would have no hygienic importance. Here it may be 
merely remarked in general that wheat and rye starch in 
mixtures cannot be distinguished with certainty (see 345) ; 
on the other hand, the fragments of cells, hairs, &c., occur- 
ring in the flour furnish data for a diagnosis. (See Biblio- 
graphy, | 34G, and the remarks in 338.) 

A very good characteristic is the colour of the layer of 
gluten cell?. In rye it is commonly from light to dark blue, 
whilst in. wheat no such colours have been hitherto observed 
(Arch. / Hyyicne, iv.). 

3. Chemical and Microscopic Detection of Diseased 
Grains of Cereals and of the Seeds of Weeds. 

329. It may be important to detect in flour the seeds of 
weeds. If the meal is coarse (groats), the expert, after pass- 
ino- a sample through a sieve, will be able with the naked 



DETECTION OF DISEASED GRAINS. 133 

eye to detect any characteristic fragments of weeds, especially 
tares Agrostemma githago, Centaurea cyanus, among the 
coarser fragments. By seeking out fragments of the various 
kinds of seeds, weighing them, and recalculating them, a pro- 
portion of the most important kinds of weeds, of fragments 
of soil, mouse dung, &c. 5 may be determined. Thus, e.g., I 
found in a sample of bad, coarsely ground rye flour from 
North- Western Germany in 100 grm.

In other samples, used for making bread in rural districts, 
I found 0'15 per cent, of dirt. In finely ground flour the 
detection by botanical means is much more difficult, and here 
chemical methods must be tried in the first place. (See 
330.) 

For diseased grains which, like the seeds of weeds, ought 
to be removed before grinding, a microscopic examination is 
in part necessary. An examination of the un ground wheat 
is always much easier, since most of the seeds in question 
have a form which is easily recognised with the naked eye. 




134 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

The seeds and fruits of weeds which occur most frequently are derived 
from Ranunculus arvensis (meadow crowfoot), Adonis cestivalis, Delphi- 
nium consolida (field larkspur), Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard), Rhapha- 
nus raphanistum, Eapistrum rugosum, Viola tricolor, Papaver rhceas (wild 
poppy, and other sorts of poppy), Vicia angustifolia, V. cracca, V. sativa 
and other sorts of tares, species of Lathyrus, Agrostemma githago (corn- 
cockle), Caucalis daucoides, Centaurea cyanus (corn-flower or corn-bottle), 
Galium tricorne and other rubiaceous plants, species of Galeopsis, 
lihinantlius hirsutus, and some kindred species, Melampyrum arvense, 
Convoluolus arvensis, Lithospermum arvense, Lolium temulentum (darnel), 
Bromus secalinus, and numerous other grasses. Along with these there 
are never absent in wheat, which has not been cleansed, grains affected 
with secale and other diseases ; mice dirt, bodies of dead beetles, &c., 
are more rare. For representations see Harz (Bibliography), and in 
Dammer's Lexicon der Verfalschungen. 



1. DETECTION OF THE SEEDS OF WEEDS WHICH ARE 
HYGIENICALLY MOST IMPORTANT. 

330. 1. Agrostemma yitliago, L. (cockle or corn-cockle). 
- The large, characteristic seed, of a dull black colour, beset 
with fine protuberances, and having obtuse angles, contain, 
along with an intensely white starch, the poisonous glycoside 
(Agrostemmasapotoxin) of the saponine group. 

In coarse flour the black, warty fragments of the shells of the seeds 
can be easily recognised microscopically after the sample has been 
boiled for some time with hydrochloric acid at 5 per cent. In fine 
flour either the very large, characteristic starch-grain (as much as 120 p 
in length), consisting of the minutest particles, must be recognised 
microscopically, or saponine must be detected chemically. For this 
purpose a large portion of the meal is extracted with hot alcohol at 7() 
per cent., tin 1 , alcohol is completely driven off on a briskly boiling-water 
bath, and the extract is mixed with water. Even very small propor- 
tions of saponine may be recognised by the strong froth which they 
produce ii' mixed up with water. Similar starch grains are found in 
Spergula and other field- weeds. See Franz Beneke (Litpert. f. Analyt. 
Chen tie, vol. v. No. 13). 

Bread from wheat flour containing a considerable addition of cockle- 
seed was found by the author to have a bluish cast, not liable to be 
mistaken for bread containing the seeds of Rliinanthacese ; the colour 
was evidently due to the husks of the seed. 

2. Tares. There are found in grain numerous seeds of 
leguminous plants, most frequently tares : Vicia sativa, V. 
angustifolia, Ervum tetraspcrmum, E. kirsutum, &c., and 



DETECTION OF DISEASED GRAINS. 135 

some species of Lathyrus. According to VogI, acid alcohol 
(Vogl's alcohol, i.e., alcohol at 70 per cent., with 5 per cent, 
hydrochloric acid), takes, on soaking with fragments of tare- 
seeds, or more rapidly on heating, a rose, purple, or violet 
colour. Bean meal, according to Vogl, behaves in a similar 
manner. The husks of the seeds have a very characteristic 
structure. 

With comminuted white beans steeped in acid alcohol I observed 
merely a faint yellow colouring ; chamois-coloured beans took a yellow 
with a rose-coloured tint, whilst speckled and dark beans gave a 
splendid coloration from red to violet. With the dark seeds of Vicia 
angustifolia I obtained a fine rose-coloured extract ; with the pale seeds 
of Vicia sativa only a pale yellow extract with a very faint reddish 
tint. Ervum hirsutum gave a splendid red, Lathyrus sativus a very fine 
violet, Trifolium repens a red. Acid alcohol takes also a rose colour 
with a variety of rye by no means rare with many gluten-cells of a 
blue colour (Archivf. Hygiene, i. and iv.). 

3. Hhinanthacece. The seeds of Melampyrum arvense, L., 
Ehinanthus major, hirsutus, &c., along with other seeds of the 
same family, contain the colourless, non-poisonous glycoside 
rhinanthine, which is split up by acid alcohol into a blue or 
blueish-green body, rhinanthocyan, and sugar. (For parti- 
culars see K. B. Lehmann, Archivf. Hygiene, iv.) 

The seeds are fundamentally different, those of Bhinantlms being 
winged, reniform, and flat ; those of Melampyrum resemble wheat, and 
when fresh are yellowish white ; on keeping they become blue-black or 
black. 

In flour the Rhinanthacese are easily detected if they occur in the 
proportion of from 1 to 2 per thousand, by boiling for five minutes 
with Vogl's alcohol. Even minimum traces may be detected by a 
blueish-green coloration. The alcoholic extract has a well-defined 
spectral band between C and D, almost identical with that of an indigo 
solution ; even in concentrated solutions it leaves one-third of the space 
from C free. Alkalies change the colour through red into yellow. On 
examining the flour after boiling with hydrochloric acid, the dark- 
coloured fragments of tissue can be easily referred to Melampyrum or 
Rhinanthus, which are very different in tneir structure. (Figures : 
Archivf. Hygiene, iv.) 

Bread baked with flour containing the seeds of the Rhinanthaceae 
(even 1 or 2 parts per thousand) has a colour varying between violet- 
brown, violet, and blue-black ; sometimes there are only single spots, 
but if the seeds are plentiful wheaten bread may be rendered entirely 
blue-black. An extract with acid alcohol takes here often only a very 



136 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

pale colour. A microscopic examination of the darkest particles of 
tissue leads easily to an exact decision as to the genus of the Rhinan- 
thaceae. 

4. Lolium temulentum (darnel). On the determination of 
this species of grass, the bearded fruits of which are some- 
times not rare among uncleansed grain, recent investigations 
are wanting. In Moller its microscopic structure is very 
accurately described and figured. The starch-grains, like 
those of oats, are composed of numerous granules. Acid 
alcohol takes up a dirty, greenish yellow colour, which is 
not characteristic. 

Other seeds of weeds are partly not to be detected with certainty, 
and partly their detection offers no present interest. 

Nevinny found at Vienna, in 1887, out of 713 samples of flour 15 
per cent, contaminated in this manner. There were recognised :

2. DETECTION OF DISEASED GRAINS. 

331. 1. Anguillula tritici. Often found in masses in 
wheat in damp seasons. The grains remain small, short, 
thick, indistinctly three-cornered, and blackish. In the 
grains thus characteristically modified and steeped in water 
for some hours, the microscope reveals briskly mobile worms 
from 0*6 to 1 mm. in length. The disease is called gout or 
cockle-disease, from the slight resemblance of the grains to 
the seeds of Agrostemma. 

2. Ergot. This name is given to the permanent mycelium 
(sclerotium) of a fungus, Secale cornutum, which grows at 
the expense and in place of a grain of corn. 1 (Rye fre- 
quently, barley more rarely, wheat rarely, wild grasses, such 
as Lolium, Bromus, Molinia, &c., not uncommonly.) Upon 



1 From this there is developed upon moist earth a pedunculated support 
(claviceps form), the spores of which germinate upon the young plants of 
grain, and grow into them as far as the embryo, and then become conidia 
(sphacelia form). The ultimate stage is the formation of the permanent 
mycelium (Secale cornutum). 



DETECTION OF DISEASED GRAINS. 137 

Lolium perenne it is universally diffused in autumn at Wiirz- 
burg, Darmstadt, Zurich, Schafhausen, &c. The sclerotia are 
stout grains, from 1 to 2 or 4 cm. in length, from 2 to 8 mm. 
in thickness, curved, furrowed, violet-black externally, with 
whitish stripes within. At present it is rare to find ergot 
in flour, "as it is carefully sought out on account of its value 
as a drug. 

Detection in Flour. Preliminary test : A reagent-glass is 
filled to one-half with flour and then up to one-fourth with 
soda-lye ; the mass is then well stirred up with a glass rod, 
stoppered, and allowed to stand. On lifting the stopper 
after some time (thirty minutes), the herring-odour (trime- 
thylamine) is never wanting if ergot is present ; but it may 
also occur, especially in spoiled grain, in the absence of 
ergot. The following simple method is preferable : A test- 
glass one-fourth full of meal is extracted twice in succession 
with boiling absolute alcohol, eliminating thus small quantities 
of a yellow colouring-matter. Acid alcohol ( 330) is then 
added, which takes up a brownish red colouring-matter, 
gradually in the cold, but better on the application of heat ; 
2 per cent, may be just recognised, but 5 per cent, very 
distinctly. 

If examined with the spectroscope, the red solution shows 
two bands (I. at D.f E. and II. at E.JF.). This reaction 
gives good results also in bread. 

The best method of detection, though rather circumstantial, is that 
given by C. Hoffmann : 10 grm. meal, 20 cc. ether, 10 drops sulphuric 
acid at 20 per cent, are mixed together, allowed to stand for thirty 
minutes at the temperature of a dwelling-room, put upon a filter, and 
after the liquid has run off washed with ether until 20 cc. of filtrate 
have been obtained. To this filtrate there are added from 10 to 15 
drops of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. After a short 
time the latter settles to the bottom of the vessel, of a fine violet colour, 
containing all the colouring-matter. The ether is decanted off, the 
violet solution is supersaturated with dilute sulphuric acid, and the 
colouring-matter is taken up with fresh ether. In this manner O'l- 
thousandth part can be detected with certainty. 

In coarse meal, for a quantitative determination fragments of ergot are 
sought out ; pieces of 2 to 3 cbmm. yield a good colour reaction with a 
little, acid alcohol, and they may also be easily recognised microscopi- 
cally. They consist of entangled colourless fungoid hyphae, which 



138 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

break up into short fragments, and in quantity contain colourless drops 
of oil, which reflect light strongly. The adherence of fragments of the 
indistinctly cubic, violet-red zone of rind may assist the diagnosis, 
which moreover is very easy with the experience obtained from some 
comparative preparations of the smallest fragments. If the flour has 
been ground very fine, the chemical detection is more certain, although 
a quantitative determination has not yet been effected. 

3. Usiilaginece. A number of fungi of the family of the 
Ustilagineae destroy the grains of corn. 

Ustilago carbo, Tulasne (smut, or smut-brand). Found on oats, 
barley, wheat, sometimes on meadow-grasses. The spores form a black, 
dusty powder, occupying the gluma in place of the grain, which is 
entirely destroyed. The spores are almost regularly globular, light 
brown, smooth. Fig. 104, c. 

Ustilago maydis, DC. Converts various parts of the young maize 
plant (pod, stem, and leaves) into large boils, containing enormous 
masses of spores. Spores roundish or egg-shaped. Surface warty, 
brown. 

Tilletia caries and Tilletia Icevis (canker, or stinking disease of wheat). 





Tilletia caries. Tilletia Iceuis. Ustilago carlo. 

FIG. 104. Spores of Ustila^inese according to Mo'ller (magnified 
3uO diameters). 

The fungi, which macroscopically are very similar to each other, till 
the grains witli a moist, smeary, black powder. 

Microscopically the spores of Tilletia are larger than those of Usti- 
lago. In T. caries, Fig. 104, a, they are globular or roundish ellipsoidal, 
with net-like ridges ; in T. Iwvis, Fig. 104, 6, they are more irregular 
arid smooth. 

Numerous other species of Ustilago, Tilletia, and of other allied genera 
destroy rye, millet, &c. They are not yet universally distributed in 
our regions. 

The so-called black disease of grain, occasioned by fungi, is hard 
to determine and often imperfectly developed, belonging to the genera 
Macrosporium, Helminthospormm, Torula, Alternaria, &c., sometimes 
attacks especially rye ; the grains become covered with a thick grey 
coating, not easily removed, and are said to be rendered poisonous. 
Compare Von Thiimen (VerofferMick. dtr K.K. Versuchsstalion zu, 



EXAMINATION OF FLOUR FOR SOUNDNESS. 139 

Klosterneuburg, near Vienna, No. 13, 1890, and Centralblatt. /. Bakleri- 
ologie, viii. 277). The important Uredinaceous species, Puccinia 
graminis, attacks only the stems and the leaves, not the grains, as also 
probably Cladosporium herbarum. 



4. Examination of Flour for Soundness. 

332. Fresh, good flour has a pleasant characteristic 
odour and mild taste. Decompositions of the flour by fungi 
may, for the most part, be directly recognised: a bitter, 
mouldy, sharp, irritating taste ; a dull, mouldy smell, and 
sometimes a grey colour. 

Even fresh flour always contains rather numerous spores 
of moulds and bacteria ; by plate-cultures of from 1 to 5 
mgrm. of flour we easily obtain an insight into the numerical 
relations. Accurate enumerations are still wanting. See 
Bernheim (Chem. Zeitung, 1889, p. 513). 

According to these researches fresh flour taken from the grind ing- 
shafts of a mill contains per milligramme from 35 to 200 microbia, 
among which there are many hyphomycetes. Bought polenta meal 
contains from 400 to 500, mondamine about 120. 

If flour is allowed to lie, especially in a damp place, the number of 
microbia increases rapidly. According to Poehl (Ber. d. d. Chem. 
Gesellsch., 1883, p. 1915) sugar is formed from the starch, and further, 
if kept moist, lactic and butyric acids, peptone, and poisonous fission- 
products of the latter. Storage in sacks for two to three years gives 
occasion to the origin of poisonous alkaloids, which may be extracted 
from the meal by ether, and removed from the ethereal extract by means 
of water (Ballaud., Journ. de Pliarm. et de Chimie). But even if there 
are no especially unfavourable conditions in its preservation, or it is 
kept too long, flour in the summer months easily becomes " warm," the 
gluten is thereby rendered " short," and the flour is fit for baking only 
if it is ground over again with an addition of sound flour ( 326). It 
must then be rapidly used, otherwise the added meal is decomposed in 
the same manner. According to Aime Girard (Annal. de Chimie et de 
Phys., ser. vi. vol. iii. p. 289) the spoiling of the meal is determined 
especially by decompositions of the fat in the germ, in which it is 
abundantly present. The germ should therefore be removed to render 
the flour capable of keeping. 

Flour from sprouted grain (wheat or rye) displays remark- 
able radiating clefts, beginning at the margin, a distinct 
stratification of the starch-grains, the margin of which often 



140 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

appears as if gnawed or notched (Fig. 105). But latterly 
the certainty of these criteria has been strongly doubted. 
According to Hilger and Giinther the acidity of the flour 
from sprouted grain (lactic acid) is increased from 0'02 to 
0'04 per cent, to O06 or Oil per cent, and in like manner 
the maltose from 0*17 to 0'32 per cent, to 0'51 or 1-1 per 
cent. Acari are not rarely found, and seem at times to be 
transferred to man 1 (see Centralblatt f. Bakterioloyie, i. 429, 
and vi. 422). 

B. Examination of Bread. 

333. For the preparation of bread a thin preliminary 
paste is first made with a part of the flour mixed with yeast 
or leaven; it is then allowed to stand covered for some 
hours at a gentle heat, and the remainder of the meal is 
kneaded in. When the dough is ready it contains from fifty 
to sixty parts of water 2 to a hundred parts of flour. The 
processes in the dough are threefold (see Dimiienberger in 
the Bibliogiaphy : 

1. The cere aline, a diastatic unorganised ferment pre- 

existing in the grain, partially converts the starch 
into dextrine and maltose. 

2. The yeast-cells, added either in the yeast or in the 

leaven, form from the maltose carbonic acid and 
alcohol. 

3. If leaven was used containing numerous schizomycetes 

along with the yeast-cells, there are always formed a 
little lactic, acetic, and butyric acids. 

The various recent proposals to produce carbonic acid in the paste, 
not by fermentation but by the transformation of salts (HC1 + 
( ( :J Xa,., Liebig), (P0 4 CaH + C0 3 NaH, Horsford) [C 4 H 7 0, ; K (tartar) + 
COaXall, baking-powder] or to prepare the dough with water satu- 
rated with carbonic acid under pressure (Dauglisln are free from

Unfortunataly bad, half-spoiled materials are often used, which, to say the 
least, are not appetising. 



EXAMINATION OF BREAD. 141 

objection hygienically, but hitherto they have not come into general 
use. 1 

The pores in the bread are formed by the expansion of the 
carbonic acid and the evaporation of alcohol in the baker's 
oven, the temperature of which ranges from 200 to 270, and 
at the same time a further portion of the starch is converted 
into dextrine. The interior of the loaf only reaches tempera- 
tures of about 100 ; in the crust carameloid substances of 
pleasant taste are formed by the high temperature at the 
surface. 

100 kilos, of flour yield from 112 to 120 kilos, of long loaves with a 
thick crust, or from 120 to 135 kilos, of round loaves with a thin crust. 
In German ammunition bread (Lenz) : 50 kilos, meal + 450 grm. salt 
yield twenty-three loaves of 3 kilos, each. It must not contain less than 
50 per cent, of solid matter, not more than 2 per cent, of ash, and 3 per 
cent, of bran. 

In the examination of bread, in addition to the points dis- 
cussed in speaking of bread, we are interested in a series of 
further questions. 

Appearance. Wheat bread has a light colour, rye bread is 
dark. The sorts of wheat flour poor in bran are chiefly used, 
which yield a paler bread; in rye meal, in addition to the 
admixture with more bran, the action of the acidity of the 
dough upon the gluten comes into play as a darkening agent. 
Bread is rendered blue or violet by seeds of the Rhinan- 
thacese ( 330). Flour from badly cleansed grain scarcely 
ever yields light-coloured bread. 

If bread is baked for an insufficient time, if the oven is too 
cool, if the dough has been made too watery, or the gluten has 
in part lost its fitness for baking, there is produced an im- 
perfectly porous, dense, watery bread sometimes traversed by 
water stripes (portions containing much moisture and too 
little air). On moulds (hyphomycetes), see 341. 

1 la England leaven is never used except in the preparation of oaten bread. 
The addition of potatoes is legalised, though it is a fraud on the consumer, 
since their value, both nutritive and commercial, is inferior to that of wheat 
flour. Baking-powder, and the solid, so-called German yeast, are used to a 
arger extent than in most parbs of the European continent. Editor. 



142 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

For determining the proportion of moisture a large piece 
is cut out, so that the proportion of crumb and crust may be 
the same as in the loaf. From round loaves the sample is 
taken by means of two radial sections ; from long loaves a 
slice of about 2 cm. in thickness is cut right through. For 
weighing an apothecary's balance is used, and the weight is 
determined accurately to 1 cgrm. Before drying the bread 
is torn into small pieces. 

334. The examination for ash (the ash of the flour + 
sodium chloride), albumen, fat, and cellulose is executed as 
usual. 

In Belgium, North France, and England, the dough l is 
not uncommonly mixed with a little copper sulphate or alum 
to cause it to rise more quickly and to appear whiter; 50 
mgrm. of copper sulphate per kilogramme of dough, or 3 grm. 
of alum have a striking action (Bruylant, Rev. Inter nat. des 
Falsific., 1889). Especially flour from sprouted corn, or flour 
injured in its baking properties, by storage, &c., can be baked 
after receiving these additions, because, as it is alleged, the 
deliquescent constituent has been precipitated again. For- 
merly zinc sulphate, which is much less effective, was used 
along with copper sulphate. 

Alum is detected in flour, according to J. Herz, as follows : A test- 
glass is filled with meal to one-third of its capacity, a little water is 
dropped in with the washing-bottle, and the meal is thoroughly moist- 
ened by striking with the hand. Next we add a few cubic centimetres 
of alcohol and a few drops of freshly prepared tincture of logwood 
(5 grm. logwood with 1UO re. of alcohol at 9(j per cent., allowed to stand 
and iiltered), the thick paste is shaken up, the glass is filled up with 
a saturated solution of sodium chloride without shaking again. From 
0-05 to O'l per cent, of alum are recognised by a blue colour and O'Ol 
per cent, by a violet colour. Bread is steeped for six or seven minutes 
in tincture of logwood and pressed out. In presence of alum it takes 
in two or three hours a violet red, but otherwise merely a yellow colour. 
The sensitiveness is the same as in flour. Check experiments should be 
made with bread which is certainly free from alum, and with such as 
has been moistened with a solution of alum. 



1 Steeping the seed-corn in liquids containing copper or arsenic has no 
influence on the composition of the grain reaped. 



EXAMINATION OF BKEAD. 143 

Copper sulphate may be extracted from meal by water; 
the solution is coloured a reddish brown with potassium 
ferrocyanide. Bread is .touched at once with the reagent, 
which produces reddish brown spots; an addition of 550 
mgrm. per kilogramme or upwards renders the bread re- 
markable by its greenish colour. Pure flour, according to 
numerous analyses by French chemists, on an average has 
8 mgrm. copper per kilogramme; this copper, derived from 
the plant, does not react with potassium ferrocyanide. 

Zinc sulphate is sought for in the ash. See Section 
XVIII. 

For the quantitative determination of zinc and copper the bread is 
incinerated in a porcelain capsule after it has been well moistened 
with concentrated sulphuric acid, and dried again upon the sand-bath. 
The difficult quantitative determination of alumina is best left to a 
chemical specialist. 

Lead and zinc have been introduced into bread by the use of painted 
or impregnated wood to heat the baker's oven (e.g., Ducamp, Annal 
cV Hygiene, 1877, Sept.) ; hitherto, however, no mercury or arsenic has 
been met with. But arsenic has repeatedly been introduced into dough, 
from malice or by mistake, and occasioned wholesale poisonings (Paris, 
Wiirzburg, Kaiserslautern, &c.). 



335. For determining acidity 100 grm. of bread, finely 
comminuted, is introduced into a calibrated roomy beaker 
with so much hot water that the volume amounts to 400 cc., 
well stirred up, and allowed to stand for some hours in a cool 
place. For titration we take two portions each of 100 cc., 
using one-fourth soda, and as indicator phenolphthaleine. 
The acid of the bread can be almost completely extracted 
from the bread with water; free acetic and lactic acid is 
present only in very small quantities ; along with acid 
potassium phosphate (K. B. Lehmann). I am still engaged 
with further studies on this subject. 

336. On microscopic examination we find in bread 
chiefly swelled and ruptured starch grains, totally distorted 
into balls and clots. In order to search for fragments of 
weeds, &c., I recommend treating about 10 grm. of bread 



144 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

exactly according to the Weender method for determining 
cellulose ( 221). From the cellulose obtained pure by 
decantation, characteristic fragments of weeds may be isolated, 
especially cockle, ergot, corn-flowers, galium (less easily tares, 
&c.). I have instituted also quantitative determinations of 
weeds (cockle) in this manner, determining the surface of the 
isolated fragments of the seed-husks, and comparing them 
with the surface of a known weight of cockle-seeds. I 
have met with loaves containing up to 7*0 per cent, of 
the dry substance. Isolated fragments of corn-cockle may 
be weighed. 

It has been recently recommended to destroy the starch 
with strong hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate, espe- 
cially also for the microscopic diagnosis of rye and wheat 
Hour. (See Soltsien, Pharm. Zeitung, 1889, p. 313.) 

The examination for hyphoniycetes in bread must also be conducted 
microscopically, but unfortunately it is little demanded from a hygienic 
point of view. Examinations of bread by the plate method are still 
wanting, but might be easily effected with the finely grated material. 
Bacillus mcsentericus vulgatus ( 84) has recently been shown by 
Kratschmer and Niembwicx to be the cause of a slimy decomposition 
of bread (Centralblatt f. Balderiologie, vi. 501), and Uffelmann (Central- 
biatt /. Bakteriologie^ viii. 482) shows that besides B. mesentericus vulgatus, 
11. niesentericus liodermus occasions this decomposition. Loaves which 
are slightly acid seem subject to this decomposition. 



C. Decision Concerning Flour. 

337. 1. Proportion of Moisture and Soundness. Flour 
contains generally from 12 to 14, rarely only from 10 to 12 
per cent, of water; the presence of 18 per cent, must be 
pronounced too great. Such flour has not merely a diminished 
nutritive value, but it is frequently spoiled, as moisture 
greatly promotes decomposition. If any suspicious property 
is detected : a mouldy smell, an irritating taste, an abnor- 
mally high number of rnicrobia, a microscopically rich assort- 
ment of hyphoniycetes, the flour must be pronounced as 
strongly suspicious of unwholesomeness, as shown in 341. 



DECISION CONCERNING FLOUR. 145 

A certain criterion for the unwholesomeness of a spoiling 
flour is unfortunately still wanting, but especially in the 
summer months much flour which has become heated is still 
baked. The destructive pellagra of Upper Italy may certainly 
be traced to spoiled maize. (Compare also Ergot.) 

The preservation of flour is still in many cases irrational ; the storage 
in sacks is quite unsuitable ; it is recommended in preference to store 
it on open, airy warehouse floors, frequently turning it over, or to solder 
up the flour, previously dried at 100, in metal vessels. 

338. 2. Admixture of Diseased G-rain. Ergot, according 
to Kobert, contains, along with the paralysing ergotic acid, 
sphacelic acid which occasions gangrene, and besides numer- 
ous harmless alkaloids, the highly poisonous cornutine, which 
occasions abortion, muscular cramps, and violent intestinal 
irritation. 

Ergotised bread most frequently brings on chronic poison- 
ing ; after its use for five days, though sometimes only after 
the consumption of such bread for five weeks, symptoms of 
poisoning have been observed. For the phenomena of the 
affections which appear sometimes as Ergotismus yangrcenosus, 
and sometimes as Ergotismus convulsivus, see medical litera- 
ture. Even quite recently there have occurred amongst us 
epidemics (e.g., inHessen, 1879 to 1880). One part per 1000 
of ergot in bread is said to be sufficient to bring on chronic 
poisoning (certainly J to 1 per cent.). A single dose of 4 grm. 
may occasion severe poisoning. Children are particularly 
susceptible. Small quantities of ergot seem often to occur 
in badly cleansed grain ; of four samples of coarse rye meal 
from the north-west of Germany which I recently examined 
all contained ergot, one sample as much as 0*9 per cent. (See 
Kobert, Arcliiv /. Exper. Pathologie, 1884, and Krysinski, 
Patlwl. und Krit. Beitrdge zur Mutterkornfrage, Jena, 1888.) 

A remarkable fact, too little recognised, is that fresh ergot is in many 
places eaten by children in the fields as a delicacy in not inconsiderable 
quantities it is alleged without any bad consequences ; two persons 
assured me that they had often done it. Poehl expresses the direct view 
that the action of ergot depends on ptomaines formed in moist ergotised 
flour. On the other hand, we must remember that the experiments on 
animals have all been made with pure ergot. 

VOL. II. K 



146 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

Spores of Ustilaginea; probably occur only scattered. 
Otherwise poisoning is conceivable in view of the danger 
that our indigenous Ustilagineas may act like Ustilago maydis. 
Concerning the latter, there exist along with numerous posi- 
tive American statements (e.g., Rademacher and Fischer, 
Pkarm. Journal, vol. xx. 1887), the account of a contractive 
action on the uterus, also experiments on ruminants (Brefeld) 
without any result. Robert also did not succeed in isolating 
a poisonous substance from Ustilago maydis. 

On the other hand, there exist, especially concerning Tilletia caries, a 
series of veterinary observations showing that beasts became seriously 
ill, or perished after consuming strongly sporiferous meal. (For the 
bibliography see in Friedberger and Frohner, Spec.. PathoL u. Therap. 
dcr Thierkranl-hciten, 2nd edition, vol. i. p. 219.) We may readily 
assume a formation of ptomaines by these fungi. In any case it is 
advisable for the present to declare flour injurious to health if it con- 
tains an abundant proportion of Ustilaginese without regard to the 
species. The Uredineoe also on the stalks and leaves are said often to 
have had an injurious action. (See literature cited above.) 

Strongly narcotic symptoms have been observed last year 
in France consequent upon the consumption of grain covered 
with abundant fungoid vegetations (Prilleux, Centralblatt f. 
Bakteriologie, x. 200), and Russia (Woronin and Sorokin, 
Centralblatt f. BuUcrioloyie, x. 231, &c.). Careful botani- 
cal examination detected numerous heterogeneous fungi, 
which are described in detail, though none of them can be 
definitely regarded as the cause of the toxical action of 
the grain. Nothing is remarked concerning the seeds of 
weeds. 

.'539. 3. Seeds of Weeds. Any detection of seeds of weeds 
in Hour or bread to at all a plentiful extent warrants its 
being regarded as hygienically exceptionable. If a poisonous 
weed has been detected this decision is a matter of course, 
but even the recognition of non-poisonous weeds is sufficient, 
as it proves the Hour to have been imperfectly cleansed, and 
thus betrays the possible presence of poisonous weeds which 
have hitherto not been detected at all, or at least not with 
certainty. 



DECISION CONCERNING FLOUR. 147 

From 4 to 5 grm. of cockle-seeds baked into white bread are sufficient 
to produce slighter irritations of the mucous membranes (pharynx, 
bronchial canal, and stomach). See K. B. Lehmann and Mori, Arch. f. 
Hygiene, ix. Calves are killed by a dose of about 250 grm. ; all domestic 
animals, especially the carnivora, suffer from their ingestion, but sheep 
and rabbits very little. For particulars on the toxicology of the Sapo- 
nine group see Arbeiten des Pharmak. Instit. in Dorpat, parts i. and vi., 
edited by Robert. 

In northern, and especially in north-western Germany, grain is con- 
sumed (from country mills), which in many cases is badly cleansed to 
an incredible degree. (See 330 to 336.) 

Concerning darnel (Lolium temulentum) earlier statements are partly 
contradictory ; poultry in general bear it easily. 0. Becker (Arch. /. 
Pharmacie, 1872, p. 178) observed in several persons, after partaking of 
a loaf containing 17 per cent, of darnel, trembling, dizziness, and sweat- 
ing. Gainpf even reports a fatal case (Jahresbericht f. Pharmacie, 1878, p. 
636) ; on the contrary, Wilson alleges that he has consumed considerable 
quantities of the seed of darnel baked up in bread without injury. 
Antze (Hyg. Rundschau, i. 315) has recently isolated from Lolium a 
volatile alkaloid, loliin, and a non- volatile alkaloid, temulentine, and 
has established their intensely poisonous action on rabbits and men in 
experiments which are certainly described in a rather inaccurate 
manner. 

Latliyrus Gicera, L. Clymenum, and L. sativus have occasioned in the 
south very severe affections of the spinal cord (spastic spinal paralysis) 
if admixed with bread. (See Schuchardt, Deut. Arch. f. Klin. Med., 
vol. xl. 1887, and J. Ch. Huber, Friedreich's Blatter, 1886, p. 34.) 

Tares (Vicia) seem non-poisonous ; animals bear them perfectly ; I am 
not aware of experiments on men. Among the other leguminous plants 
occurring among grain, some may possibly be poisonous, e.g., Ervum 
ervilia has a poisonous action upon swine in Greece. 

I have personally eaten in large quantities Rhinanthus seeds baked 
up into bread (twice 10 grm. and once 35 grm.} without any bad effects, 
and to beasts they seem harmless (Arch. f. Hygiene}. Similarly inert 
were seeds of Melampyrum arvense and sylvaticum (15 grm. of each), 
which I recently consumed baked up in bread, though certainly only 
once. The " melampyrism " of the French is very probably caused by 
another weed. Delphinium consolida, Adonis, and probably Ranunculus 
seeds may also have a poisonous action, as they notoriously contain 
poisons, but hitherto they have never been recognised as causes of 
poisoning. Numerous field- weeds have not been examined. 

340. 4. Mineral Components or Additions. As soon as 
rye flour yields more than 2*5 per cent, of ash, or a wheat 
flour more than 2 per cent, it has not been well prepared 
(badly cleansed, or ground with bad millstones), or got up 
fraudulently ; more than 0*2 per cent, of sand is inadmissible. 



T4 8 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

Danger is not occasioned by calcium sulphate, calcium or 
magnesium carbonate, but it is by relatively small quan- 
tities of barium salts soluble in the gastric juice, e.g., barium 
carbonate. (See Section XVIII.) Whilst an addition of 
barium carbonate at once renders flour unwholesome the 
insoluble barium sulphate is harmless. For a fatal case of 
poisoning by a tart containing 274 per cent, of barium car- 
bonate, see Vierteljah. f. ger. Mcdicin, vol. xxviii. 1878. For 
the presence of lead see Section XVIII 

The addition of copper or zinc sulphates must be objected 
to from a hygienic point of view. 

Concerning the much discussed unwholesomeness of small 
quantities of these substances compare Section XVIII. ; in 
any case, they have no business in bread, and in Germany at 
least there is absolutely no ground for their toleration, 1 since 
they enable the use of inferior flour hygienically suspicious, 
and an increase of the proportion of water (as likewise does 
alum) by 6 or 7 per cent. Further, the addition of these 
substances, where customary, is often practised in so slovenly 
;i manner that we have no guarantee against the incidental 
presence in bread of doses which are toxicologically serious. 

There have been found, e.g., O53 grm. copper sulphate, and 0'35 firm. 
/inc sulphate per kilogramme of bread. Compare Eulenberg and Volil 
(Vierteljahrsclirift f. yericld. Medicin, 1870, p. 322), and Kuhlmann 
(Dingier 's Poli/t. Journal, vol. xxxix. p. 439). 

Small admixtures of alum may be in themselves hygienically un- 
important, but they are objectionable on the same grounds as the 
presence of copper. In Antwerp there has been recently found in flour 
as much as r.12 per cent, of alum, the workman who had to make this 
addition confessed that he judged the quantity merely by the eye. Two 
Dutch professors declared from two to five per thousand of alum in 
bread not injurious ; here also experiments are wanted for a certain 
decision. Generally speaking, flour with an abundant addition of alum 
is regarded as exciting disturbances in digestion and constipation. See 
49()a. 

D. Decision on Bread. 

341. In a special decision on bread, in addition to the points 
mentioned under flour, the following must be considered : 

1 Is there such ground in any other country ? Editor. 



DECISION ON BREAD. 149 

1. The moisture in bread must in no case exceed 40 to 45 
per cent. In general the proportion of moisture fluctuates 
greatly, and is very essential for determining the nutritive 
and the commercial value of any sample. According to 
Konig the average moisture is : 

Per Cent. 



Rye bread. . . . 42-fi 
Ammunition bread . . 36 '7 
Pumpernickel 1 . . . 43 '4 



Per Cent. 

Rolls .... 28-6 
Fine wheat bread . . 35 '6 
Coarse wheat bread . . 40 '5 

According to Fehling, white bread contains 45 per cent, of moisture, 
and black bread 48 per cent. 

New bread, whilst still hot, is universally regarded as 
unwholesome, as on mastication it forms lumps not easily 
pervaded by the gastric juice. As a rule, newly baked bread 
should not be eaten before the lapse of twenty-four hours. 
On keeping, ammunition bread loses daily 1 per cent, of its 
weight by the escape of water ; the soldiers do not generally 
obtain it until it is eight days old. 

Bread, after some time, becomes "old," or "stale," not so much by 
the loss of water as by the transit of moisture from the starch to the 
gluten. The crust becomes softer, and the crumb drier ; by heating 
(to about 80 internally) the water (a kind of water of hydration) is 
driven back from the gluten to the starch. Thus is explained the 
paradoxical fact that dry bread may be rendered " new " again by a 
short heating. If the proportion of water was below 30 per cent., and if 
the bread consequently was already several days old, a slight moisten- 
ing of the surface is previously necessary. Additions of barley, oats, or 
maize cause the bread quickly to appear dry. An admixture of potato 
flour yields moist bread. The addition of bran facilitates the fraudu- 
lent production of watery bread. Artificially freshened bread, if other- 
wise not spoiled, cannot be regarded as unwholesome, nor can it be 
pronounced inferior in value from a hygienic point of view. 

It occurs again and again that old remnants of bread, comminuted, 
are mixed up with new dough to the extent of about 1 per cent. The 
hygienist must here ask above all things what was the nature of such 
stale bread ; if it consisted of refuse or mouldy fragments, the bread 
produced will be disgusting, or under certain circumstances even inju- 
rious ; if it was good although old, 110 hygienic principle seems to be 
violated. The practice requires strict suppression, as no distinction is 
generally made whether the bread thus added was more or less spoiled. 

1 Pumpernickel is a very course rye bread containing much bran. It is 
chiefly used in Westphalia, and is totally unknown in Britain. Editor. 



150 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

2. Thorough Baking. Bread which has not been properly 
fermented, which is watery or not well baked, is difficult of 
digestion, and for persons of weak digestive organs it may 
be positively unwholesome. Growths of hyphomycetes occur 
in such bread in exceptional abundance; resistant spores 
may survive after imperfect baking, and the proportion of 
water fosters their growth as also in good bread which has 
been kept in a damp place. Bread from flour which has 
been damp and has had its gluten modified is tenacious of 
damp, and will have risen badly. 

3. Acidity. On titrating dough according to 335 I 
found in 100 grin, of commercial bread, containing from 30 
to 45 per cent, of moisture, very considerable differences, 
due to the kind of flour used, quite independent of the 
manner of preparation. Thus, in fine white bread the acidity 
was generally only from 1 to 2, but rising exceptionally to 
5 and 6. Heavy North German coarse rye bread showed an 
acidity of from 1 or 2 to 17 and 18. From about 110 
examinations of bread I have deduced the following names 
for the degree of acidity (see K. B. Lehmann, Archiv f. 
Hygiene, xvi.): 

Normal Alkali per 100 <jrm. of Frexh Cnaab of Bread. 

Name. 

1 to 2 . . . . . . . Not sour.

7tolO Distinctly sour. 

]0 to 15 . . . . . . . Strongly sour. 

15 to 20 ....... Very strongly sour. 

20 to 25 Extremely sour. 

4. Bread from spoiled flour contaminated with organic or 
inorganic constituents is to be judged like such flour. 

5. Mouldy bread has often had injurious effects ; it is 
always disgusting, and tastes unpleasantly. Kowalowsky 
maintains that he has observed in bread made from mouldy 
flour a diminution of the albumen at the expense of the other 
nitrogenous constituents (Chcm. Zcitung Repert., 1890, p. 191). 

Until it has been demonstrated that certain kinds of mould do not 
render bread injurious, it must always be regarded as unwholesome. 



DECISION ON BREAD. 15 1 

In view of the low resistance of the moist spores of moulds to heat, we 
must always assume infection of the bread subsequent to baking, in 
which flies are occasionally concerned. Payen has indeed asserted that 
the spores of Oidium auruntiacum resist a temperature of 120. 

The most celebrated and most frequently described is a reddish- 
yellow mould, Thamnidium auranti'icum (= Oidium aurantiacum), 
which has often occasioned epidemics in France. The use of such 
bread, which has a bitter taste and an offensive smell, produced violent 
thirst ; prisoners fed upon it were reduced in health ; the transforma- 
tion products of the microbe seem therefore to be injurious. Feeding 
with the mould had no effect on the lower animals (Rochard) ; but 
Decaisne alleges that he has rendered cats and rabbits ill by feeding 
with this mould. In 1871 the bread at Paris was in many cases quite 
uneatable in consequence of the orange mould. Besides and along 
with Oidium aurantiacum, species of Mucor, Rhizopus, Aspergillus, and 
Penicillium have often been observed upon and in bread. Catarrh of 
the bowel has not unfrequently been the consequence of the use of 
such bread, but severe illness seems to have been rarely observed, e.g., 
Robertson (Lancet, September 10, 1887). The Jahresb. f. Pharmakol., 
&c., 1866, p. 428, report the illness of an entire family after the use of 
very mouldy bread ; the severe illness of three persons, and the death 
of a girl five years of age from eating mouldy black bread. Brugna- 
telli and Zenoni assert that they have isolated alkaloids from mouldy 
maize-bread. For the bibliography of mould-poisonings and figures of 
the various moulds see Rochard (Annal. d'Hygiene, 2nd series, vol. xl. 
p. 40). 

Bacillus prodigiosus renders bread and other starchy substances dis- 
agreeable in appearance on account of red spots, but does not seem to 
form poisonous transformation products. Whether Bac. mesentericus 
vulgatus renders bread unwholesome is not determined, but it unques- 
tionably renders it unpleasant, 

| 342. On the question what bread is best adapted for 
nutriment, the following points have to be considered : 

1. If it is required to present to a sound stomach the most 
nutritious bread possible at a low price, a rye bread containing 
a moderate proportion of bran (about 20 per cent, of the 
grain must be separated out as bran) which is utilised down 
to 10 per cent, of the solids is by far the most practical, 
although 22 per cent, of the nitrogen is lost in the bowel. 
The moderate acidity which ascends in the bowel, and the 
moderate proportion of bran, accelerate the peristaltic motion, 
whence the rather high loss of solids ; the nitrogen of the 
bran is utilised only to two-thirds of its weight, whence the 
relatively high loss of albumen in the faeces. But such, 



152 FLOUR AND BREAD. 

bread is cheap, agreeable in taste, and does not disagree even 
in quantity. 

2. If the digestive organs are remarkably well developed 
or accustomed to it, even the heavy groat bread, strongly 
acid, and made from the whole grain, can be tolerated. On 
account of its cheapness it forms a good nutriment, in virtue 
of its high proportion of acid and bran, notwithstanding its 
imperfect utilisation (the loss of total solids being 19 per 
cent., that of nitrogen 42 per cent., and of carbohydrates 
10 per cent.). 

According to Uffelmann this would be in fact the cheapest form of 
nourishment with bread. G. Meyer finds the utilisation so imperfect 
that, according to his experiments, nutrition with the more expensive 
fine rye bread (or medium fine bread) would be cheaper. Rubner also 
finds it economically more correct to eliminate a part of the bran and 
to use it as cattle food. Wicke has recently again shown in Rubner's 
laboratory that a decortication which removes 5 per cent, of the grain 
raises the utilisation from 79 to 87 per cent., and therefore involves a 
direct advantage (Archil' f. Hygiene, xi. and xii.). 

3. If, on the contrary, a bread-nutrition is to be selected 
which burdens the stomach as little as possible, and is as 
little voluminous as is practicable, fine white bread, especially 
rolls, must be preferred, as of them only 5 per cent, of the 
total solids, 20 per cent, of the nitrogen, and 1 per cent, of 
the carbohydrates reappear in the fzeces. In spite of the 
good utilisation, the kilogramme of absorbed albumen and 
carbohydrates in the form of white bread is more expensive 
than in other sorts of bread. 1

grinding ; it is therefore a preparation doubtfully appetising, 
and is generally coloured. 1 

In preparations of leguminous seeds the degree of commi- 
nution is important ; a microscopic examination easily shows 
how far the several cells are untouched or crushed. The 
finest products of this kind scarcely contain any unbroken cells.

Strikingly yellow colorations of vermicelli, the object of

APPENDIX II THE MOST IMPORTANT KINDS OF 

STARCH. 

344. Starch is obtained industrially by elutriating the 
ground materials with water. Starch should be free from 
ash, pure white, dry, free from the spores of moulds, of a 
pure smell and taste. On its composition see Table IX. 

In view of the extensive application which starch expe- 
riences (that of wheat, of potatoes, maize, rice, and some 
exotic plants) as an article of food, a tabular conspectus of 
the most important kinds is here given. The differential 
diagnosis depends on microscopic characters, and is without 
hygienic importance, as all kinds of starch agree probably in 
their chemical composition, and are equally utilisable and 
wholesome. Foreign sorts, though without any hygienic 
ground, have a higher commercial value, and are especially 
prized for the lood of children. Of native starches, potato- 
starch (often named potato-flour, or swelled and moulded as 
German sago) and wheat-starch (under all possible names, 
and also as a powder) are principally met with in trade ; 
maize-starch is sold as maizena and mondamine, &c. ; 2 rice- 
starch is the most expensive. The following conspectus 
shows the most important starches and their names, according 
to Moller :

Table for the Determination of the most Important Starches. 2 

(In part according to Moller.) 

345. I. All or nearly all the starch-grains are single, not compound. 
a. Grains roundish, lumpy, or lenticular ; stratification exists at 
most only at the margin. 

1. Along with large roundish grains, the stratification of 
which is barely indicated, there are small globular or 
angular fragmentary grains ; intermediate forms be- 
tween these two kinds cannot be detected with cer- 
tainty. Wheat, Rye, Barley. 

These sorts of starch cannot be distinguished with certainty 
without taking into account the form of fragments of the pericarp 
which may possibly be present. We have to consider : 

1. For wheat: Nuclear splits in the large grains not very 
frequent. ^Majority of the large grains roundish and 
from -20 to 30 p. in diameter, the largest 50 p.. JVheat. 
2. For rye : In the large grains cross clefts are very common. 
Along with the large roundish grains there are also 
crooked forms. The majority of the large grains are 
from 30 to 35 p. in diameter, the largest 50 p.. Rye. 



1 It will be seen that the nomenclature of the starches i.s very confused. 
1-dltor. 

- For quantitative determination of potato, wheat, and rye starch the use 
of a polarising microscope is recommended. The potato-starch grains appear 
much lighter ; the percentage of the two kinds of grain may be found by 
counting. (Chem. Zcituny, 1890, p. 1605.)

3. For barley : Very like wheat-starch, but bean-shaped 
and irregular lumpy forms are rather more common. 
The large grains are generally from 20 to 30 /*, not 
above 35 p in diameter. Barley. 

b. The grains have all indistinctly crystalline surfaces, sharp edged, 

with a nuclear cleft, but not stratified. The angular grains are 
in reality parts of larger aggregations. Diameter 20 /*. Maize. 

c. Grains simple, roundish egg-shaped, with pronounced stratifi- 

cation. 

1. Many grains above 50 /z in diameter. 

a. Most grains egg-, shell-, or hatchet-shaped, single 
falsely connected grains. Nucleus chiefly at the 
pointed end. Potato. 

j8. Numerous grains, more than 100 JLI, shield-shaped; 
nucleus at the broad end, partly emarginate and 
partly drawn out to a point. No compound grains. 

2. Xo grains above 50 p.. 

a. Grains flat, rod-shaped on a side view. 

1. Grains drawn out into a short point at the 

narrow end, near the nucleus. Curcuma. 

2. Grains sharpened like a wedge at the broad end, 

otherwise similar. Dioscorea. 

3. Very similar, but more sausage-shaped. Banana. 
/3. Grains not flat, tuberous, rounded. 

1. The large grains are chiefly bean- or kidney- 

shaped, distinctly stratified at the margin, and 
show a nuclear fissure running in the longitu- 
dinal axis, with numerous cross fissures. The 
small grains are rounded or longish (beans, 
lentils, peas, tares). Legumens. 

2. The starch from mature wheat or rye is similar; 

but here, along with the stratification, the 
gnawed appearance of the margin and the 
occurrence of radiating clefts are striking. 
Wheat and rye (from mature grain). 

3. Grains of a rather irregular form, and with very 

distinct stratification around a nucleus situated 
centrally or near the obtuse end. Maranta. 

II. Grains mostly compound or having many surfaces, i.e., sharply 
(It-tilled, rectilinear surfaces may be seen on the rounded grain. 
a. Grains composed of numerous (as many as 100 and upwards) 
small angular granules. The aggregates may reach CO/i in 
sixe, the granules 6 to 8/z, or at most 10 p.. 

1. There are only the above-described forms, with sharply 

angular granules. Rice. 

2. There are also small rounded or spindle-shaped granules. 

Oats. 

l>. Granules roundish, polygonal, united into small aggregations. 
Buckwheat. 



HINTS ON FOODS FOE CHILDREN. 157 

c. Compound grains very scanty ; the granules mostly isolated, 

angular, large (up to 35 p.). Nucleus and nuclear fissure gene- 
rally distinct. Maize. 

d. Starch grains composed only of two to four granules, which are 

partially (often mostly) broken. 

1. Some few small granules with flat planes often adhere to 

a large, roundish main grain (30 to 80 /*), or they may 
have fallen off. Stratification distinct around an ex- 
centric, often split. Sago. 

2. The parts of a compound grain almost equal in size, twin 

forms most frequent. 

a. Many broken grains, drum-shaped, rarely exceed 
ing 20 p. ; a central nuclear hollow, stratification 
indistinct. Manihot. 

|8. Fractional grains, of the shape of a sugar-loaf, in 
size as much as 50 p.. Stratification around an 
excentric nucleus. Batatas (sweet potato). 

The fact that many starches, to give them the appearance of a purer 
white, have received the addition of a blue colour, is hygienically of no 
importance, as the dye-wares employed (ultramarine, prussian blue, or 
smalt) are quite harmless in the proportions present. 

APPENDIX III A FEW HINTS ON FOODS FOR 
CHILDREN. 

346. The numberless preparations for the artificial 
nourishment of children may be divided into (1) preparations 
of finely ground cereals or leguminous seeds ; (2) prepara- 
tions in which the starch is partially converted into dextrine ; 
(3) preparations more or less dextrinised, to which con- 
densed milk, often strongly sweetened, has been added. 

The examination is conducted according to the methods 
given for flour and milk ; the determination of the various 
carbohydrates simultaneously present must be regarded as of 
exceptional importance (see 221). Particulars both as to 
their composition and examination may be found in Konig 
(Chemie der menschlich. Nahrungs- und Genussmittel). 

The physiological decision does not lie within the scope of 
the present work. See Munk and Uffelmann, Erndhrung 
des gesund. und krank. Menschen, 2nd edit., Vienna and 
Leipzig, 1891. Moreover, foods for children must most 
strictly conform to the principal demands laid down for flour 
and milk.

SECTION X.* 

VEGETABLES, POTATOES, FRUIT, AND THEIR 
PREPARATIONS. 

i. Potatoes. 

347. Sound, ripe, i.e., fully matured potatoes form one 
of the most important popular foods. 

A chemical analysis (see Table IX.) is scarcely ever necessary on 
hygienic grounds ; if required, we must cut discs from the peeled 
potatoes, of which about 200 grm., accurately weighed, are strung on a 
thread and dried at about 30 ; they are then ground finely (say in a 
new coffee-mill) ; the air-dried meal is weighed and examined exactly 
like the flour of wheat. 

Within a limit of error of about 1 per cent, the proportion 
of starch and the total solids may be read off from the 
specific gravity by means of the following table. 

The determination is carried out as follows : 

Over a capacious cylinder of glass there is laid a metal rod, from 
which a point projects downwards towards the level of the water. When 
the water touches this point the cylinder contains, e.g., 2 litres of water. 
We then weigh off 1 kilo of cleansed dried potatoes and place them 
in the empty vessel : 1 litre of water is then added, and more water 
is allowed to flow in from a burette until its level exactly touches the 
point (e.g., 120 cc.). If there are altogether 1120 cc. of water in the 
vessel along with the potatoes, then : 

2000 - 1120 = 880 cc. is the volume, and 1000 : 880 = 1-136 the 
^specific gravity; therefore, according to the following table, the total 
solids amount to 317 per cent., and the starch to 25 '9 per cent.

This method gives available values only for sound, ripe potatoes. 
As long as no trace of sprouts appears in the depressions of the potato- 
tubers they are, according to Xowak, to be considered as immature. 

Young, unripe potatoes (especially, it is said, when they 
have grown upon a heavy soil), and also potatoes which have 
been kept too long and are sprouting, contain solanine, 
especially in the skin and in the shoots. Ripe potatoes 
which have reached their full size are either very poor in 
solanine or totally free from this alkaloid. 

Haaf found in 1 Idlo. of germinated potatoes freed from the sprouts 
0-32 ()rm., in the same when peeled 0'24 r/rm., in 1 ki'o. of unripe 
potatoes 0*42 yrm., and in unripe potatoes peeled 0*32 r/rm. solanine 
(Schweiz. Wochensch.f. Pkarmacie, 1864.) 

The rather frequently observed injuries to health, especially 
from the use of young potatoes, is often ascribed to solanine, 
but such potatoes are difficult to digest, on account of the 
high proportion of water and the small percentage of starch 
(see Fruit). The poisonous character of solanine in potatoes 
is at least exaggerated ; the diseases of cattle ascribed to the 
consumption of solaniferous potato-waste (distillery waste) 
have been partly infectious diseases and in part poisonings 
with ptomaines. Potatoes are further said to lose the chief 
part of their solanine by boiling. For the bibliography of 
works, &c., on solanine, see Perles' Arch. f. cxpcr. PathoL, 
vol. xxv. 



FRESH AND DRIED VEGETABLES AND FRUIT. 161 

On keeping, there ensues in the potato a slow decrease of 
the starch, which passes temporarily into dextrine, and in 
small quantities into sugar. If potatoes are preserved in a 
very cold place, the consumption of sugar is arrested more 
than the formation of sugar, and the tubers become therefore 
unpleasantly sweetish. 1 If they are then removed to a room 
not artificially heated, the sugar is destroyed, and the taste 
becomes normal again. Frozen potatoes are often destroyed 
by putrefaction after thawing, but before they putrefy they 
are not hurtful to health. Tubers bared of soil become 
dark-coloured next the stem ; their pungent taste is said to 
be due to solanine. 

The potato-disease (occasioned by Peronospora infestans) 
attacks both the leaves and the tubers; the latter are de- 
stroyed partly by dry and partly by wet decomposition, when 
various moulds and certainly schizomycetes establish them- 
selves as saprophytes. E. Kramer recently described a 
bacillus nearly allied to Hueppe's Bacillus butyricus as the 
cause of the wet-rot in potatoes. If the spoiled parts are 
cut away, the remainder may be eaten without injury ; the 
decayed part tastes and smells so badly that no one will 
consume it. 

2. Vegetables and Fruit in the Fresh and Dried 
State. 

348. Vegetables scarcely require a hygienic examination ;, 
if they have become too old and woody they are inferior in 
value, poor in nutritive matter, and are imperfectly utilised ; 
stale vegetables are inferior in value, and not appetising. 
If vegetables are watered with cesspool drainage containing 
the ova of Taenia solium, the latter may find their way into 
man, and grow up to cysticerci; pathogenic bacteria may 
possibly be introduced by vegetables which have not been 
purified. An investigation in this direction is much required.

pathogenic for man (e.g., typhus bacilli into turnips) seems 
impossible, according to recent researches. 

According to Lominsky (Centralblatt f. JBakteriologie, viii. 
325), various bacteria penetrate into the roots of young 
plants, but do not increase in them. Several pathogenic 
species, if inoculated into living leaves, are said not merely 
to maintain themselves, but even to multiply. A verification 
of these observations is desirable. 

Very remarkable are tlie observations of De Loos (Jahresbericlite f. 
Pharmdlc.j 1877, p. 536), according to which sometimes vegetables from 
a plnmbiferons soil (situation of some disused white-lead works) take 
up very considerable quantities of lead. Thus, 650 grm. of turnips 
had absorbed 10 myrm. of lead, six carrots (-21-2 rjrm.) 17 mgrni. ; four 
endives, it is alleged, had taken up even 130 myrm. It may oftener 
happen that plnmbiferons dust adheres to plants. 

Mistakes of Acthusa cynapium (fool's parsley) for oarsley, Cicuta 
virosa (water-hemlock) for celery, Oenantlie crocata for carrots, &c., are 
not rare. Cases of poisoning occasioned in this manner have been 
repeatedly observed. 

Sauerkraut produced from white cabbage by lactic fermentation 
contains 91 per cent, water and from 1 to H per cent, lactic acid (E. 
Reichardt, Chem. Zcituiuj Hep., 1891, p. 96). 

Dried vegetables are now produced of excellent quality, and, when 
properly prepared, taste as if fresh. New methods do not come into 
question in hygienic examinations. 

349. Concerning fruit there exist to my knowledge no 
recent hygienic researches. Unripe fruit, rich in cellulose, 
acids, and in tannin, and poor in sugar, occasions catarrh of 
the stomach and bowel. As criteria of ripeness the popular 
characteristics suffice for an experienced observer. 

For stone fruit and berries, the colour, consistence, and 
taste must be examined, for seed fruits l it is necessary to 
examine whether the pips have taken a brown colour. For 
carriage (e.g.. to England) it is necessary to despatch fruit 
before full ripeness, and allow it to ripen out in an airy 
situation. 

A severe case of poisoning by twenty-five (!) unripe pears is reported 
in the Vienna Med. Prcsse, 1886, No. 34. The poisoning in which 
nervous disturbances (cramp, and loss of speech for six days), predomi- 



1 Seed fruits," in contradistinction to stone fruit, are apples, pears, &c. 



PEESERVED VEGETABLES AND FRUIT. 163 

nated over the gastric symptoms, was referred to prussic acid from the 
pippins. Prussic acid poisonings by peach-kernels, bitter almonds, &c., 
are known to have been observed not nnfrequently. 

Mouldy fruit must be judged as in 341. A severe 
poisoning of a mother with her child by mouldy cherries (the 
mould is said to have been Cladosporium herbarum), with the 
symptoms of European cholera, was observed by Bondier. 
Many persons are said to take mouldy cherries intentionally 
as a gentle laxative. 

Dried fruit, dried southern fruits, are to be examined for dirt (sand, 
&c.), for mould and mites. The latter are rarely entirely absent. A 
decision is come to as above ; numerous mites render the fruit disgust- 
ing. In American dried fruit a proportion of zinc has latterly been 
detected in several cases. 

349 a. Among the fruit juices raspberry juice especially 
plays a prominent part. Currant and cherry juice are of less 
interest. The attempt is made to obtain the juices from the 
pressed and sweetened fruits in a permanent state partly by 
boiling and partly by fermentation. Salicylic acid and other 
preservative agents appear perfectly unnecessary. The pure 
juice of cranberries contains 0*64 to -I 76 per cent, of benzoic 
acid (Mach and Portele). 1 As the colour occasionally suffers 
by unsuitable preparation or preservation, it is artificially 
heightened with the vegetable colours (infusion of field- 
poppy flowers). See Lecco, Eev. Internationale des Falsifi- 
cations, 1890, p. 117, or more commonly with tar colours. If 
the customary red coal-tar colours are used in the small 
quantity necessary, and if they are free from arsenic and 
other impurities, then, as it will be explained in 494, no 
objection can be raised from a hygienic toxicological point of 
view. For the detection of these colours we may use the 
methods given in 399. For metals see 460. 

3. Vegetables and Fruit Preserved in Boxes. 

Preserved vegetables are partly sterilised by heat alone 
without any additions, the closed vessels (tins, &c.) being

1 64 VEGETABLES, POTATOES, FRUIT. 

heated in a water- or a lime-bath, or they are converted by 
the plentiful addition of sugar, sometimes of vinegar or anti- 
septics, &c., into such bad nutrient media that when they are 
well boiled, poured into clean glasses and tied up, they 
require no further heating to be permanent. 

350. We are here concerned merely with the exami- 
nation. 

1. For Soundness. Every indication of fermentation 
(bubbles of carbonic acid) or alteration of taste necessitates 
caution in forming an opinion ; after a repeated boiling such 
preparations are almost always safe if they have been kept 
in glass or earthenware, but they are always to be suspected 
if metal boxes have been used. The acids formed during 
fermentation facilitate the solution of poisonous metals. Pre- 
serves in a state of incipient putridity, i.e., ill-smelling pre- 
serves, are probably injurious in consequence of the formation 
of ptomaines. A layer of mould, which can easily be removed, 
may generally be regarded as harmless to health if the taste 
of the preserve l has undergone 110 change. 

2. For metallic poisons (copper, lead, tin, zinc) see Section 
XVIII. A question continually discussed, especially in 
France, is the imwholesomeness of preserved vegetables to 
which a bright green colour has been imparted by salts of 
copper. Traces of copper are very prevalent in uncoloured 
vegetables ; in such as have been stained Gautier found a 
mean of 90 'nirjrm. per kilogramme, but as much as 150 and 200 
myriu. of copper have been found in peas which, according 
to Brouardel, did not betray themselves by any unusual taste. 
Cronquist found at Stockholm as much as 0'2 yrm. For a 
decision 011 such additions see Section XVIII. They are in 
any case unnecessary, as the public would rapidly become 
accustomed to yellowish green vegetables of the natural 
colour. 2 

1 The German word, konscrrc, includes preserves, pickles, and preserved 
meats. Editor. 

- It has been suggested in France that whilst the addition of copper to 
vegetables for exportation might be sanctioned, it should be strictly suppressed 
in such as are for home consumption. Editor. 



MUSHROOMS. 165 

Tins for preserves have often been the means of introduc- 
ing into preserved vegetables appreciable quantities of lead 
and tin. 

Gautier states the average proportion of lead in tinned 
vegetables as 2*5 mgrm. per kilogramme. He found animal 
substances preserved in oil much richer in lead ; in sardines, 
lobsters, &c., preserved in oil, he found from 10 to 50 mgrm. 
per kilogramme ; the oil from the preserved meats was often 
still richer in lead. 

Ungar and Bodlander (Ergdnzungslieft zum CentralUatt / 
Gresundheitspflege, vol. i.) detected from 200 to 400 mgrm. 
tin per kilogramme in vegetables and fruits which had been 
preserved in boxes of tinned iron. Blarez obtained similar 
results (Journal de Pharmacie et de Chemie, 1890, part 4). 
Ungar and Bodlander even seek in one case to refer a case 
of acute illness in a human subject to the presence of tin in 
preserved fruit. See 487. 

Tinned tomatoes often occasion poisoning in England and America, 
where they are in request ; the cases are referred to metals (lead and 
tin). An organic acid in the fruits effects the solution of the hurtful 
metals. 

3. For preservative agents (see 228). Brand found 
enormous quantities of S0 2 , as much as 1'57 grm. per litre, 
in tinned vegetables, especially asparagus. In other samples 
there was found 0'34 per cent, of S0 3 , where the sulphurous 
acid had therefore been already oxidised. (Bayr. Industrie 
u. Gewerbsblatt, N. F. 1889, 21, 703; Glum. Zrit. Rep., 1889, 
p. 349. 

4. For the nutritive value of such preserved foods, for the 
proportion in which they are utilised in the human system, 
and for their worth at the price, see 222. 

4. Mushrooms. 

351. The examination of the fungi fit for consumption 
must be effected according to one of the special works cited 
below, accompanied with coloured figures. Whoever has not 
made a thorough study of these plants should confine himself 



166 VEGETABLES, POTATOES, FRUIT. 

to the consumption of five or six common species not likely 
to be mistaken for others. Even the f ungologist ventures to 
eat, relatively speaking, few species. 

There are no general characters for the recognition of 
edible fungi; thus, e.g., the dreaded blue coloration of a 
broken part occurs also in certain wholesome species; an 
unpleasant smell of a fresh mushroom is no more proof of 
poisonous properties than a pleasant smell and taste are of 
the contrary, tXrc. 

It must be noted that the virulence of many (of all ?) 
poisonous fungi varies enormously according to the year and 
the locality ; e.g., Amanita phalloides, from one and the same 
locality near Berne, was in two successive years very poison- 
ous and almost harmless ; Boletus luridus yielded, according 
to Bohm, in four successive seasons smaller and smaller pro- 
portions of muscarine ; species of agaric were very often 
eaten in the neighbourhood of Munich, when they suddenly 
became at once poisonous. Exactly those fungi which are at 
times harmless demand the most numerous sacrifices, as it is 
customary in many places to eat them without hesitation, it 
is natural that, along with the fluctuating poisonousness of 
one and the same species, cases of poisoning may often arise 
from confounding poisonous with harmless species. 

It is a matter of course that even of the kinds known as 
wholesome only such specimens must be gathered as are 
fresh, not corroded, decayed, or damaged by rain, and the 
mushrooms must be carefully cleansed before use. It is not 
advisable to preserve portions of dishes of mushrooms which 
have not been consumed. The use of dried mushrooms is as 
far as possible to be avoided ; they are, according to Bischoff, 
seldom correctly determined, often imperfectly cleansed, 
often preserved in an unappetising manner, dusty and per- 
forated by insects. The superior preserved mushrooms of 
commerce kept in glasses fulfil all conditions, and must be 
judged like preserved vegetables. 

In Berlin tlie dried morels consist only to a small extent of the dried 
Morchella esculenta (according to Bischoff) ; many samples contained 
chiefly poisonous species of Helvella, and in consequence occasion 



BIBLIOGRAPHY. 167 

frequent poisoning cases. The dried mushrooms were found by the 
same author composed of various harmless kinds of Boletus. The 
poisonous Sderoderma aurantiacum was once found instead of truffles. 
These confusions or substitutions would evidently prove often more 
serious in their results if many fungi did not lose their virulence on 
drying, especially Helvella esculenta. 

The theory of nutrition at present takes a view opposite to 
that formerly held as far as the fungi are concerned, i.e., 
that in spite of the high percentage of nitrogen in their 
solids they do not rank higher in nutritive value than the 
majority of vegetables. Like the latter they yield an edible 
food only in presence of much water, their proportion of 
nitrogen is largely referable to worthless amido-compounds, 
the utilisation of their albumen is very imperfect. Like the 
majority of green vegetables, they contribute more to enjoy- 
ment than to nutrition. (For details see the works below 
mentioned, especially that by Uffelmann.)

SECTION XI. 

SUGAR, HONEY, SACCHARINE. 
i. Sugar and Honey. 

352. For domestic purposes the sweetening ingredient 
almost exclusively used is saccharose, obtained from the 
sugar-cane or from beets. The crystalline products met with 
in the form of loaves or cubes scarcely require any hygienic 
examination, as they consist approximately of pure cane- 
sugar. Farina-sugar, powdered sugar, &c., are said to be 
occasionally falsified with other white powders, as flour (see 
327). 

The ash is determined with small quantities of pulverised 
sugar ; further quantities are not added until the former 
portions are completely incinerated. It is recommended to 
add to the sugar a little vaseline, containing no ash, as the 
combustion is thus rendered much more tranquil. 

The recent proposal to ignite 5 grin, powdered sugar in a 
platinum capsule along with 5 to 7 yrm. of coarsely powdered 
quartz sand yields excellent results (Alberti and HempeL 
Chcm. Zeitu.ncj Pep., 1891, p. 227). 

A proportion of inverted sugar ( 220) occasionally met 
with in cane-sugar, and falsifications of crude cane-sugar 
with the less sweet grape-sugar, do not concern hygiene. 
Reasons for this will follow. A detection or a determination 
of these sugars, which reduce Fehling's solution, is easily 
effected in presence of cane-sugar as directed in 221. 

Grape-sugar from grapes is scarcely met with in trade as 
an article of food. But artificial grape-sugar (so-called starch- 
sugar or potato-sugar) plays an important part. 1 Starch- 

1 Would it not be better to confine the name grape-sugar to the natural 
product from grapes, and to call the artificial product exclusively starch- 
sugar, potato-sugar, or glucose? Editor. 



SUGAR AND HONEY. 169 

sugar is obtained by boiling starch with diluted sulphuric 
acid. 

After the sulphuric acid has been removed by means of calcium car- 
bonate and the liquid decolorised with animal charcoal, the solution 
obtained is evaporated down. A moderately pure starch-sugar separates 
out in crystals on slow cooling ; the ordinary qualities are obtained by 
strong evaporation, and are rich in maltose and dextrine-like substances. 
Sieben found, e.g., 20'1 per cent, of water, 21 '7 glucose, 15'8 maltose, 
41-96 dextrine, and 0'3 per cent, of ash. This examination is made 
difficult by the fact that the dextrines are neither absolutely incapable 
of fermentation (though they ferment only with difficulty), nor are 
they quite incapable of reducing solution of copper. See remark at the 
conclusion of this section. 

Starch-sugar (of a faint sweetish taste) is used partly as a 
syrup for a cheap sweetening agent in food, partly it serves 
(or served) as an addition to wine or to must, as a substitute 
for honey, for glazing coffee-beans, &c. 

On the alleged unwholesomeness of impure glucose, rich 
in non-fermentable dextrinoid substances, see Wine. 

353. Pure honey (bees') has, according to Sieben, an 
average composition of 34'7 dextrose, 39 '2 levulose, 1*1 
saccharose, 20 water, and 5 non-sugar. Its appearance 
(clear or rendered turbid by crystalline granulation), colour, 
and aroma vary rather considerably according to its origin 
and composition. " Virgin honey " is the finest quality ob- 
tained in May and June, and caused to flow out of the comb 
spontaneously by the heat of the sun. Centrifugal honey is 
obtained by "whizzing" the comb; the ordinary sorts are 
melted out of the comb. 

In sixty genuine samples of honey the invert- sugar fluctuated from 
68 to 79 per cent, the proportions of dextrose to levulose varied also 
(limits : 57 per cent, dextrose to 43 levulose, and 32 dextrose to 68 
levulose). Cane-sugar was entirely absent in twenty-seven cases, but 
rose in some cases to 8 per cent. ; l the moisture ranged from 16 to 25 
per cent. ; the non-sugar varies from T3 to 8'8 per cent. (Sieben). 



1 Had the bees obtained cane-sugar from adjacent sugar-works, a case 
which has happened? The bees, however, distinguish between cane-sugar 
and beet-sugar, eschewing the latter if the former is accessible. Editor. 



170 SUGAR, HONEY, SACCHARINE. 

In genuine boney non-fermentable carbohydrates, or such 
as after careful ( 220) inversion did not reduce copper 
solutions, are always absent. The non-sugar consists of 
albuminous substances wax, pollen, acids (always a little 
free formic acid), and salts. 

In Switzerland honey is sold in quantity by all possible 
names, mixed with syrup of starch-sugar. These products 
strike the connoisseur at once by their want of fine aroma 
and taste. The chemical detection is based upon the spar- 
ingly fermentable dextrines in starch-sugars. To ascertain 
if a honey is genuine we proceed as follows, according to 
Sieben : 25 yrm. of honey in 180 cc. of water are mixed with 
12 grin, of press-yeast, free from starch, and allowed to 
ferment for two days at the temperature of a dwelling-room ; 
the liquid is clarified with aluminium hydroxide, and the 
residual liquid is filtered. It must be : 

1. Perfectly inactive with polarised light. 

2. It must not reduce Fehling's liquid, even if it has been 

heated with hydrochloric acid, as in saccharifying 
starch or dextrine ( 220). 

In the opposite case syrup of starch-sugar is present. 

If we do not employ press-yeast, as did Sieben, but the rather less 
powerful beer-yeast or even wine-yeast, we find that the sparingly 
fermentable carbohydrates of the dextrine group may occur even in 
genuine honey to the extent of 6 to 9 per cent. But these dextrines 
are more readily fermentable than the so-called "gallisine" in impure 
starch-sugar, though the latter disappears on sufficiently continued 
fermentation, with press-yeast whirh is often renewed. 

Compare 300 and Amtlior (licrichtf J. f> Vcrs. Ihiyer. Chem. in 
Munch, 188~, and Zdt. f. Any. Chan., 1889); Yon Raunier (Zeit. /. 
Any. Chem., 1889 and 1890, and 9 l^rmtnm. J layer. Chun, in Erlangen, 
1890) ; and, lastly. Mader (Arch.f. llyyiene, x. 399). 

The quantitative determination of dextrine is effected according to 
the principles laid down in 220. 

An addition of starch is revealed by the microscope (in 
pure honey there should be no figured elements except 
pollen) ; an addition of mineral powders is detected on 
determining the ash; pure honey contains only from 0'2 to 
0'3 per cent, of ash ; possible addition of gelatine is shown 



SUGAK AND HONEY. 171 

by a solution of tannin, which in genuine honey produces 
merely tender flocks, but such as has been adulterated with 
gelatine a dense precipitate. 

These sophistications are not injurious to health, and must 
be judged according to the principles laid down in 364. 
Compare Wine. 

Langelutje Sugar-honey. Kecently, according to Weigle, 
there is met with a product composed of invert-sugar, water, 
very small quantities of mineral matters and free acids, 
which can be distinguished from genuine honey neither 
chemically, physically, nor by taste, and is consequently a 
complete substitute 1 (Glum. Zeitung, xv. 1891, and Chem. 
Zeitung Rep., 1891, p. 146). 

Poisonous honey rarely occurs in Europe ; H. Wagner 
mentions poisonous honey collected by humble bees from 
aconite flowers. The honey of Trebizonde is poisonous from 
the presence of aiidromedo-toxine (Pltigge), derived from 
azalea blossoms. Species of kalmia, andromeda, rhododen- 
dron, and azalea render the honey of New Jersey poisonous 
(Tresh). Numerous other species of ericaceae contain the 
same poison ; our erica, calluna, rhododendron, and ledum 
do not. For details on andromedo-toxine see De Zaayer, 
Pfliigcr's Arckiv, vol. xl. The poison is soluble in alcohol, 
insoluble in ether and chloroform, white, crystalline, non- 
nitrogenous, and excites violent vomiting. 

For this section compare E. Sieben, Ueber die Zusammensetzung des 
Stcirkezuckersyrups, des Honigs und die Verfalschung des Letzteren ; Zeit. 
des Vereins f. d. Rubenzuckerindustrie des Deutschen Reiches, 1884, p. 837. 
This distinguished work adduces many auxiliaries for the examination 
of sugar mixture (especially dextrose along with maltose, dextrose with 
levulose), and numerous citations. It is not practicable here to enter 
more closely into these researches, which require an experienced chemist, 
and which are hygienically only of subordinate interest.

name, and with a distinct declaration of its artificial character. Editor. 



i;2 SUGAK, HONEY, SACCHARINE. 

2. Saccharine. 

354. Latterly saccharine 



(orthobenzoic sulphinid, C G 

has appeared in trade as a white inodorous powder three 
hundred times as sweet as cane-sugar. It is sparingly soluble 
(1 : 260), reaction slightly acid ; an alkaline salt has been 
recently introduced as "easily soluble saccharine." Its taste 
is slightly aromatic, and its after-taste irritating only when 
the powder itself, or a concentrated solution, is tasted ; dilute 
solutions have a purely sweet flavour. It is partly recom- 
mended as a substitute for cane-sugar in certain cases, e.g., 
for champagne, chocolate, &c.. and for diabetic patients as a 
substitute for sugar in general. 

As 2 rjrm. saccharine suffice to give 1 kilo, of starch- 
sugar the same sweetening power as that of 1 kilo, cane- 
sugar, it is likely that substitutions of a cheaper for a more 
expensive material will be attempted in this direction. 

The detection of saccharine is effected by extracting the 
dried substance with anhydrous ether; if the evaporated 
residue has a sweet taste saccharine is present, all sugars and 
also glycerine being insoluble in ether. Ch. Schmitt (Rep. 
d. Anal. CJicm., 1887, p. 438) has given a chemical test, 
founded on the conversion of saccharine into salicylic acid. 

According to the researches of Immerheiser (Vcrsamnil. d<-r Bayer. 
Chem. in Erlangen, 1800), ;i slight proportion of salicylic acid is 
present in many pure wines, whereby the value of this test is rendered 
questionable. 

The method most recommended at present is that of Weigle-Hilger : 
the substance dried up upon sand is exhausted with ether + petroleum 
ether (a). The residue, after evaporating off the ether, is dissolved in 
slightly alkaline water, freed from any powder of sulphur and drops of 
ethereal sulphurated oil by passing through a moist filter, mixed with 
soda and evaporated to dryness, and introduced into melting saltpetre. 
Thus sulphuric acid is obtained from the sulphur of the saccharine, 



1 According to E. Salkowski the older samples of this preparation are con- 
taminated with 60 per cent., and in the more recent with 30 per cent, para- 
sulphamine benzoic acid, which does not affect the subjoined remarks, as 
they refer to samples made in the summer of 1889. 



SACCHARINE. 173 

which is precipitated with BaCl 2 , and weighed as in 176, 1 mgrm. 
BaS04 = 0'78 mgrm. saccharine. 

The decision on saccharine from a hygienic point of view 
is given by F. Jessen and K. B. Lehmann (Arch. f. Hygiene, 
x.), according to their own experiments, as follows : 

1. Saccharine is, according to the experiments of all 
authors, non-poisonous ; neither single enormous doses (5 grm. 
to a strong man), nor the daily ingestion for three months of 
O'l or 0'2 grm. saccharine (corresponding in sweetening 
power to from 30 to 60 grm. of sugar), produced in five men, 
two boys, and two girls any symptom of disturbed health. 

2. The utilisation of milk in man is not affected. The 
action of saliva upon starch is not affected by easily soluble 
saccharine; the peptonisation of albumen in artificial digestive 
experiments is slightly retarded. Experiments on the lower 
animals (Ogata) proved that in dogs sugar retards the diges- 
tion of albumen. 

3. The substitution of saccharine for a carbohydrate 
reduces nutritive value, since saccharine has no nutritive 
value at all. A substitution of pure starch-sugar sweetened 
up with saccharine for an equal weight of cane-sugar cannot 
be regarded, physiologically speaking, as an injury. 

4. For the diabetic patients saccharine affords the possi- 
bility of an agreeable variety in the taste of their food ; the 
substitution of saccharine for sugar in champagne may be not 
unwelcome (?) to lovers of sweet champagne, as a large pro- 
portion of sugar often affects digestion unfavourably. The 
antiseptic and antizymotic properties of saccharine have no 
practical value. 

5. If the use of saccharine is thus hygienically unobjection- 
able a declaration of its presence should be unconditionally 
demanded. 

With these conclusions the most recent results of E. 
Salkowski (who has not met with our researches), are in com- 
plete accord (Virchow's Archiv, vol. 120, p. 325). Also the 
Versamm. Bayer. Chemiker in Erlangen, 1890, takes a very 
similar view. 



SECTION XII. 

VEGETABLE ARTICLES OF CONSUMPTION 
FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

i. Tea. 1 

355. Tea. The plant producing tea. Thea chinensis, is an 
evergreen shrub closely allied with the camellia of our conserva- 
tories, which is grown not only in China and Japan but in 
some other subtropical regions. 2 Its young leaves yield the 
fine teas, whilst- the older leaves produce inferior sorts. Tea 
reaches us principally in two forms : 

Green Tea. Immediately after gathering the leaves are 
heated for a few minutes in iron pans, then kneaded, rolled 
up, and dried in the sun. 3 

Black Tea. The leaves are first allowed to ferment in 
heaps, when they assume a dark colour, and are then dried 
like green tea. Tea for exportation is often scented by inter- 
stratifying it with odoriferous flavours, which are sought out 
afterwards. Green tea for the European consumer is gener- 
ally or universally 4 coloured by dusting it over with .Prussian 
blue, smalt, indigo, turmeric, clay, or gypsum, in a manner 
which is certainly harmless. Along with these inoffensive 
substances, the detection of which would lead us too far. lead 
chromate is said to be used. (Compare here, as well as upon 
colouring and the lead lining of the tea-chests. Section XVIII.) 

1 Of the composition of these substances, Table X. gives a general account, 
which is noticed in the text only in so far as it leads to direct conclusions. As 
our knowledge of their physiologically active constituents is in many cases 
still very fragmentary, and a decision on the value of the different sorts can 
be given with more certainty by the taste and the scent of the expert than by 
chemical analysis, I have communicated the chemical examination only in so 
far as it is practically required for the recognition of sophistications.

TEA.

In books we find much said concerning all possible falsifications of 
tea by the leaves of other plants. Dozens of plants (cherry, sloe, 
willow, willow-herb, ash, strawberry, &c.) are said to have been used as 
substitutes. Hilger mentions, on the contrary, that he has only once 
detected an admixture of willow-leaves. In a series of examinations of 
tea of the cheapest sorts and tea-dust, I was not able to detect any 
sophistication with strange leaves. 

Falsifications of tea are carried on in Russia on the most 
extended scale by admixture with epilobium leaves or 
exhausted tea-leaves. See Tichmorow's careful studies 
( Vierteljahrschrift in den Fortschritte u. d. g. der Chemie der 
Nahrungs und Genussmittel, 1890, p. 444. Good figures, 
macroscopic and microscopic, may be found in Mace, Sub- 
stances Alimentaires, Paris, 1891. In the Caucasus, Vaccinium 
arctosdaphyllos L. is used for the falsification of tea, and it 
has already reached England under the name Batum tea. 

356. For botanical investigation tea-leaves are softened 
in hot water and spread out upon plates of glass ; or they 
may easily be preserved entire by laying 
them in glycerine-gelatine or in Canada 
balsam after previous drying between 
blotting-paper. Fig. Ill shows the char- 
acteristic representation and the course 
of the nerves of the tea-leaf ; particular 
weight must be laid upon the arched con- 
nection of the lateral nerves. 



If the exterior of the leaf gives rise to suspicion, 
portions, especially from the vicinity of the 
nerves, are examined under the microscope with 
a magnifying power of 300 diameter. In a 
genuine tea-leaf, not too young, we shall rarely 
fail to find the highly characteristic stone-cells l 
very large, knotty, ramified growths, the length 
of which almost equals the entire thickness of the 
leaf (Fig. 113, id). Less characteristic are the 
calcium oxalate glands, which otherwise also are FIG. 111. Tea-leaf, 
found frequently in leaves (Fig. 113 K}. In Natural size. 

addition there are also on young leaves more or 
fewer long hairs, often bent at the base in a right angle (Fig. 112 A) 




1 The finest teas, consisting of the youngest leaves, often do not display the 
stone-cells, which should be sought under the main rib of the leaf.

sometimes the young leaves appear quite sappy, whilst the old leaves 
are often nearly bald. The openings of the fissures (Fig. 1 1 2 sp) are 
large, broad, without accompanying cells, not particularly character- 
istic. The epidermis of the upper and under side of the leaf is not

striated. Dilute potassa-lye, or a saturated solution of chloral hydrate, 
facilitates the examination by rendering the preparation more luminous. 
A doubtful tea-leaf can generally be distinguished from the above- 
mentioned substitutes by means of these characteristics. But leaves of

other Camelliaceae (which, unlike the leaves above-mentioned, possess 
also stone-cells) may be used for the falsification of tea (Riche and 
Collin, Ohem. Zdt. Rep., 1890, p. 42). 

Of much more commercial importance than the addition of 
strange leaves is the mixture of good tea with leaves which 



TEA. 177 

have been already used. This is said to be carried out on the 
very largest scale. The demonstration of this fraud is difficult 
even for specialist experts, and this on the following grounds : 

1. We may attempt the determination of thein (caffein), 
but even in good teas its proportion fluctuates from 1 to 3 
per cent., 1 most commonly from 1-8 to 2 '3 per cent. 

According to Hilger and Vite', caffein is best determined 
in tea in the following manner : 

5 grm. of tea in powder fine enough to pass a hair sieve with 
meshes 4 cmm. are three times extracted for an hour, using each 
time 300 cc. of water (conveniently done in an egg-shaped tea- filter). 
The united extracts neither strained nor filtered are concentrated 
down to one-fourth, and then whilst hot mixed with freshly precipitated 
lead hydroxide, with an addition of coarse-grained sand, previously 
washed. The mixture is evaporated to dryness on the water-bath, and 
the whole is extracted for three hours with chloroform in Soxhlet's 
apparatus. The residue left on distillation is dissolved in hot water, 
the filtrate is evaporated down in a crystallising capsule or small flask 
on the water-bath, and the residue is dried at a temperature not exceed- 
ing 100 (preferably in a steam-drying closet) and weighed. 

2. The percentage of tannin which is decreased by extrac- 
tion can be restored by the addition of catechu, which at the 
same time improves the colour. Thus the value of a deter- 
mination of the extract is rendered questionable. 

According to Tichomizow the tannin in the extracted 
leaves is diffused in the entire leaf, whilst that in the leaves 
which have not been extracted is confined to certain tissues. 
The following characteristic is said to be the most important : 
if dry tea-leaves are laid from one to four days in a solution 
of copper acetate saturated in the cold, then well washed, cut 
up into pieces, and dyed with iron acetate ; in tea which has 
been extracted, the idioblasts take a blue-black colour, whilst 
in unchanged tea they remain colourless. This circumstance 
had not been regularly confirmed by us. 

A determination of the ash furnishes a more important 

1 Evidently certain volatile, odoriferous, and sapid substances (tea-oil) deter- 
mine the value of tea to a greater extent than does the caffeine. Tea-oil is 
present to the extent of 0'6 to 0'8 per cent., being more abundant in green than 
in black tea. Paul and Cownley in England were unable to find any connec- 
tion between the price of tea and its percentage of caffein. 

VOL. II. M

indication. It must not fall below 3 per cent, nor exceed T 
per cent. Of the ash only from 2*5 to 4 per cent, should be 
soluble in water, and not more than 1 per cent, must be 
insoluble in acid. In deciding on a tea, the task of the 
hygienist is to ascertain if the sort in question is genuine and 
has not been previously used. Its value as a matter of enjoy- 
ment can be better determined by the taste of the connoisseur 
than by any examination. The substitutes hitherto in use 
must be pronounced harmless but worthless. Of course there 
is the possibility of the ignorant addition of unwholesome 
leaves. Hence every strange leaf found which does not 
admit of exact determination is to be condemned as possibly 
hurtful. See 304. 

2. Coffee and Coffee Adulterants. 

357. The name coffee belongs only to the seed of the 
coffee-tree (Coffca arabica) ; the pulp enclosing these seeds is 
also met with in commerce as " Sakka coffee." 1 

In the cultivation of the coffee-tree in the tropical regions 
almost of the entire earth numerous qualities of the coffee- 
bean are obtained differing in form, size, and colour. Some- 
times the colour is "improved" by the addition of Prussian- 
blue, indigo, ultramarine, charcoal, chrome-yellow, ochre, 
turmeric, china-clay, &c. Coloured unroasted coffee gives 
off a little colouring-matter to distilled water, but it must be 
noted that every raw coffee colours calciferous (hard) water 
green, owing to the presence of viridic acid (caffeo-tannic 
acid). Coffee is occasionally found falsified with abundance 
of the shells of the fruits (coffee-flights), small stones, stunted 
berries, in other words, with coffee-waste. 

Spoiled or "haverised" coffee, that is, a product spoiled 1>y the intro- 
duction of sea-water, is artificially got up for sale. The common salt 
must not exceed O'O and not fall below O'lo per cent. 

358. Roasted unground coffee is an important article of 
commerce. On careful boiling scarcely any caffein is lost, but 

1 The Liberian coffee, which has been experimentally cultivated in Trinidad, 
does not seem chemically identical with that produced by C.arabica. Editor. 



COFFEE AND COFFEE ADULTERANTS. 179 

there is formed " caffeon," an oily substance of an aromatic 
odour, which takes part in the effects of coffee. The sugar 
is converted into caramel and other decomposition products. 

An increase of bulk takes place in consequence of the 
tumescence of the beans ; the proportion of water is reduced 
from 12 to 13 per cent, to from 1 to 3, so that the specific 
gravity of the coffee-beans sinks from 1*041 or 1'368 to 0*5 
or 0'65 (Fade). In many cases some sugar, or more fre- 
quently crude syrup, is added during burning so as to glaze the 
beans. The alleged object of the glazing is to prevent the 
escape of the aromatic substances ; it really causes the reten- 
tion of water in the coffee to the extent of 10 per cent., 
consequently a gain of about 8 per cent. At the same time 
the cheap syrup added increases the weight by from 5 to 25 
per cent. (Konig), and coffee thus rich in caramel seems to 
the public very strong and rich. 

According to Stutzer, burnt coffee is often coloured with 
caput mortuum, and made shining with vaseline. 

The caffein is determined as follows (method of Hilger 
and Kornauth) ; it must not fall below 1*9 per cent., calculated 
on the dry substance. 

5 yrm. coffee, very finely pulverised, are perfectly extracted with hot 
water ; the extract is precipitated with neutral lead acetate ; the nitrate 
is then entirely freed from lead by passing through it a current of 
sulphuretted hydrogen, evaporated to dryness with magnesia and sand- 
in a Hofmeister capsule, and the dry residue, finely powdered, is 
completely extracted with chloroform. The evaporated residue of the 
chloroform extract is w r ell boiled with water, filtered, and the filtrate con- 
centrated in vacuo to a small volume ; the rest of the moisture is then 
removed in the water-drying niche. The remaining catl'ein should 
then be tested microscopically for its purity. 

Latterly on the Rhine and in Hungary, among other places, an " arti- 
ficial coffee " has been introduced into commerce, made up in the form 
of roasted coffee-beans, from a paste in which there occur acorns, corn, 
lupins, shells of black pepper, and sometimes even genuine caffein, &c. 
This fraudulent coffee generally sinks rapidly in the water, whilst 
genuine roasted coffee floats even upon ether. 1 

The retention of the shape and colour of the coffee-bean shows the 
object of the mixture to be fraud. The composition of the mixture, 

1 To evade this test falsifiers sometimes shake up ground coffee with a little 
oil, which prevents it from sinking. This ruse may be defeated by extraction 
with ether, which dissolves out the oil. Editor. 



i8o VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

not easily controlled, renders a right decision difficult from a hygienic 
point of view. That lupins, which in a recent state have occasioned 
fearful havoc among flocks of sheep in consequence of the presence of 
poisons which are imperfectly known, are harmless when roasted, is 
not yet proven. 

Eoasted ground coffee has to be tested microscopically for 
its purity. To this end the powder is thoroughly boiled out 
with water, and the finest particles are placed at once under 
the microscope, whilst from the coarser fragments the thin- 
nest possible sections are prepared. Potassa-lye may be 
added to render them more transparent. The inexperienced 
observer should prepare himself check-specimens from roasted 
and unroasted coffee-beans. 

Essentially we find in ground coffee merely the knotted, 
thickened, polygonal, thick-sided endosperm cells (Fig. 114), 
the contents of which (fat. sugar, and starch) are distorted on 

roasting. The upper layer of cells 
f the endosperm has an approxi- 
mately cubic form. The small 
embryo has no characteristic tis- 
sue. But the thin seed film which 
is mostly rubbed off the beans, 
and is only preserved in the groove, 
lias large, rather characteristic, 
. chiefly obliquely porous stone cells,

359. The falsification of roasted ground coffee is on a 
very large scale. Most of the adulterants are also sold 
distinct from coffee, and in all possible combinations and by 
all possible and fantastic names, as substitutes for coffee, 
with the alleged intention of substituting for expensive coffee 
a cheaper and " at the same time nutritious " beverage. Hence 
we must first examine them alone. The most important 
adulterants are prepared from chicory roots (beet-roots very 
often pass by this name). 

Figs (especially old inferior fruits) ; cereals, especially

barley and malt; leguminous seeds, i.e. lupins, canevallia, 
species of astragalus ; cassia seeds have some time ago been 
introduced into the market as negro coffee, and by other 
names. 

All these substances when roasted (and in part mixed with 
syrup) form brown powders or compact masses, with a vari- 
able proportion of moisture. The resemblance of these sub- 
stances to coffee consists chiefly in the brown colour common

to all, and in the bitter aromatic taste. The caramel gene- 
rated during roasting is the chief cause of both these pro- 
perties. Caff em is entirely wanting in the above-named 
preparation. Hager's assertion that lupins contain alkaloids 
similar to caffein in their action is not yet demonstrated. 
Sakka coffee ( 357) contains, on the other hand, some 
caffeine ; and kola-nuts, which, it is said, are used for the 
sophistication of coffee, contain abundance of caffein. Along 



1 82 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 



with the above-named adulterants there are used, according to 
authors, at least a dozen other substances. 

All the substitutes for coffee colour cold water, in conse- 
quence of their large proportion of caramel. All yield to 
boiling water an abundance of extractive matters, especially 
sugar, and the brown, bitter products of its caramelisation. 

The determination of the extractive substances, according to Trillich, 
is effected as follows : 10 grin, of the adulterant are placed in a beaker 
with a glass stirring-rod, and covered with 250 cc. water ; the total 
weight is accurately determined to O'l grm. ; it is then heated, replacing 
the water lost by evaporation, and boiled for fifteen minutes from the 
first bubbling. Particular care must be taken that the liquid does not, 
boil over at the beginning of ebullition ; afterwards it boils quietly.

When cold it is made up to the original weight, mixed, filtered, and the 
specific gravity of the filtrate determined at 15 by means of the West- 
phal balance or the pycnometer. In Schult/e's table of extracts 
(Table XIII.) we read off the contents of the solution in percentages by 
weight = ./-, and then calculate </, the proportion of extract of the 
adulterant, the moisture of which, c, is determined separately according 

to the formula: a = ; i; "' . In this manner Trillich found as a 

mean for chicory, 70'7 per cent. ; for tig coffee, 73'5 ; for barley coffee, 
65 per cent, of extract ; on the contrary, for Sakka coffee, only 20, and 
for genuine coffee about 25 per cent. 

In chicory we easily find the vessels 'Fig. H7</) densely beset with 



COFFEE AND COFFEE ADULTERANTS. 183 

aureolated dots extended in breadth ; the ramified pipe-shaped lacteal 
vessels (Fig. 116 scJi) are also generally found without difficulty; the 
various kinds of beets also display dotted vessels, and in fig coffee we 
find lacteal vessels and isodiametric stone-cells. The tissues of the 
grains of corn, especially the cells of the gluina of barley, rich in silica, 
and with a wavy outline, are easily distinguished ; leguminous seeds 
are characterised by the pallisade cells of their seed-husk. 

The following can no longer be regarded as substitutes 
(since their extracts are devoid of every similarity with coffee), 
but purely as adulterants : date-kernels, wood, turf, spent 
tanners' bark, &c., which an experienced microscopist may 
generally detect without special difficulty. 1 

360. From what has been said, the fact of the addition 
of a substitute to ground coffee is in general not very difficult 
to establish. The preliminary trial, the brown coloration of 
cold water on scattering upon its surface ground coffee, 
certainly gives an affirmative result also with " glazed " 
coffee (see above), and it may yield as high a percentage of 
extract as the substitutes. 2 A sophistication with strange 
powders can scarcely be overlooked on a microscopic exami- 
nation of comparative preparations. What substitutes have 
been added can frequently be decided with certainty only 
by the aid of the text-books of the microscopy of food, and 
only by the experienced observer. 

Injuries to health have never occurred from the rational 
use either of genuine coffee or of its substitutes. A decision 
on the value of various sorts of coffee cannot be given by the 
hygienist, since the laboratory examination is not sufficiently 
decisive. That sea-soaked coffee, coffee with an amount of 
water artificially increased, products containing stones, in- 



1 It is singular that a British patent should have been granted for the use 
of date-kernels as a substitute for coffee. The distinction which the Germans 
make between substitutes ("surrogate") and adulterants (Falscliunysmittd) is 
to be regretted. Editor. 

2 In doubtful cases the ethereal extract is also determined : coffee yields, if 
exhausted in Soxhlet's apparatus, about 15 to 16 per cent., whilst the substi- 
tutes yield only from 1 to 3 per cent. G-enuine roasted coffee floats on water, 
which the substitutes do only if artificially greased (Kornauth). The ash of 
pure coffee does not exceed 4 per cent. ; that of roasted chicory is 4, and that 
of roasted figs 5 per cent. 



1*4 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

ferior or dyed samples, &c., may under certain circumstances 
be unappetising, or even injurious, is a matter of course. 
See Section XVIII. 

The substitutes, with insignificant exceptions, are devoid 
of caffein and caffeone, and can therefore have no exciting 
action. For those who like their taste they may be harmless 
means of enjoyment. To speak of a nutritive value is ail 
exaggeration, since the trifling quantities of sugar or other 
extractive substances contained in a few cups of spurious 
coffee vanish entirely as compared with the requirements of 
the organism. Whether any of the substitutes which con- 
tain no caff em are more valuable than others is not to be 
decided from a hygienic point of view. Unappetising, sandy, 
mouldy preparations are of course to be objected to. The 
presence of hyphomycetes, if necessary, is to be examined by 
the plate process. 1 

3. Cocoa and Chocolate. 

361. The cocoa-tree (Tkcobroma cacao and its allies) is 
cultivated extensively, especially in tropical America ; it 
bears in its cucumber-like fruits large seeds, which, after 
they have in general been "rotted" (i.e., undergone a 
peculiar fermentation), are sent off and submitted to further 
treatment. The seeds are gently roasted, peeled, and finely 
ground ; the product pressed in moulds is called cocoa-paste. 
The latter, according to Zipperer, contains about 50 per cent, 
of cocoa-fat, 4 to 8 per cent, of water, about 10 per cent, of 
starch, 7 to 8 per cent, of tannin and sugar, 2 '9 to 4'8 per 
cent, of ash (according to Weigmann as a mean o'56 per cent.), 
the rest consists of proteine substances and cellulose. Theo- 
bromine is present, according to Zipperer, as 0'5 per cent., 
but according to Weigmann as much as 1*7 per cent. Konig 
takes 1*03 per cent, as the mean. The two chief products 
of cocoa are made from the cocoa-paste. 

1. Cocoa, Cocoa-powder. Almost half the fat is removed 



1 Kxtraccs of coffee occur in commerce to a considerable extent, some of 
which evidently contain little if any coffee. Editor. 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 185 

by hot pressure, leaving a product containing about 30 per 
cent, of fat. On heating the residual mass with potash or 
soda, and an addition of some magnesia (according to pre- 
scription up to 2 per cent, of the paste, but in practice often 
as much as 5 per cent.), there is obtained the Dutch opened 
or soluble cocoa. The Swiss chemists object to any addition 
of soda which exceeds 2 per cent., calculated on the weight 
of the cocoa-powder free from oil. 

2. Chocolate. Chocolate is produced by the addition of 
cane-sugar (up to from 60 to 65 per cent.) and spices up to 
1 per cent, (natural vanilla, artificial vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, 
&c.) to cocoa-paste not freed from fat. 

Chocolate, after the deduction of the sugar, should not con- 
tain less than 40 or more than 50 per cent, of fat, not more 
than 3*56 per cent, (on an average 2*13 per cent, of ash). 
The Swiss chemists do not sanction more than 2 per cent, 
of ash. The proportion of water is only about 2 per cent. 

Falsifications of cocoa and its preparations have latterly 
become less common. The most frequent are : 

1. Use of the ground shells of the cocoa-seeds, which are 
very inferior in value, and which are often soiled with earthy 
substances, and decidedly increase the ash. The ash of the 
shells varies from 7 to 13 per cent. 

2. Occasionally the most varied brown powders : ground 
barks, powdered bricks, dust, iron oxides, especially the 
starch of other plants, are added to the preparations of cocoa. 
Coloured substances are especially requisite if colourless 
additions are used in large quantities. 

3. Sometimes a portion of the natural cocoa-fat is removed 
by pressure, and there is substituted for it in chocolate 
mutton-fat, which is cheaper. Or there is added to the 
chocolate cocoa-fat or mutton-fat, in order to be able to work 
in more starch or sugar. The fat of the cocoa-nut or dika- 
fat (from Mangqfera galonensis) serve as additions. 

The examination of cocoa preparations will scarcely ever 
become the duty of the physician or the hygienist. Chemists 
conduct these investigations essentially according to the 
general methods given in 209. 



1 86 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

The search for adulterants is partly conducted by the 
analysis of the ash (see also Spices), partly the ethereal 
extract after the expulsion of the ether is tested for its 
melting-point (cocoa-fat melts at 30, cocoa-nut oil at 26 to 
27, dika-fat at 31, mutton-fat at from 40 to 50). A 
microscopic examination detects the presence of shells and 
strange starches. Along with other characteristic elements 
the shells have massive vascular bundles with spiral vessels, 
which only occur rarely in the pure seeds. Cocoa starch is 
not very readily coloured blue by iodine ; it consists of very 
small, round granules, provided with a slight depression in 
the middle. Wheat or potato starch, if added, may be easily 
detected according to 345 ; the grains are much larger. 
If cocoa or chocolate on boiling with water becomes thick 
or pasty, this indicates an addition of starch, dextrine, or 
gum. 

Decision. Hitherto, to my knowledge, no preparation of 
cocoa has ever had a directly injurious action. The addition 
of mineral or other worthless powders is frequently un- 
pleasant, and, like the addition of shells, diminishes the 
nutrient value or the agreeableness of the product. Mutton 
f.'it seems to me also unpleasant ; its nutritive value differs 
considerably from that of cocoa-fat on account of its high 
melting-point. 

The efforts of the Association of German Chocolate- 
makers, which deserve public recognition, and the pressure 
of competition, have greatly contributed to create a beneficial 
guarantee for the purity and agreeable quality of cocoa and 
chocolate. Any addition of starch in the cheaper sorts must, 
according to an agreement among the members of the 
association, be distinctly shown on the packages in percentage 
by weight. 

4. Tobacco. 

362. The leaves of various species of Nicotiana are 
slightly dried in the air, laid up in heaps, and submitted to 
processes of fermentation. The fermented leaves are partly 
worked up without further preparation to cigars and cut 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 187 

tobacco (for smoking) ; partly they are mixed with so-called 
" sauces " (generally saccharine and scented vegetable ex- 
tracts), and used for snuff and chewing-tobacco. Cut 
tobaccos are also often "improved" by saucing; covering- 
leaves or entire cigars are coloured brown, &c. 

It is still scarcely known what ingredient in tobacco deter- 
mines its value as . a luxury ; along with nicotine there come 
into question also nicotianine (tobacco-camphor), resins, am- 
monia, and substituted ammonias, and especially the strongly 
scented fermentation oils. The smoker inhales partly the 
combustion, and partly the distillation products of tobacco- 
leaves an extremely complicated mixture, in which nicotine 
falls into the background. It was not detected at all by 
Eulenberg and Vohl, but it has been detected with certainty 
by Heubel. In addition there have been isolated in smoke : 
nicotianine, pyridine, piccoline, lutidine, collidine, sulphuretted 
hydrogen, hydrocyanic, acetic, and carbonic acids, and, lastly, 
carbon monoxide. 

From the above it cannot surprise us that a chemical 
examination scarcely decides anything concerning the value 
of a tobacco as a means of enjoyment. In addition the taste 
of individual smokers varies extremely. 

The proportion of nicotine fluctuates enormously in the different 
sorts of tobacco, according to variety, soil, and manner of preparation. 
Ohio is said to contain 0*68 per cent., and Kentucky 4'5 per cent, of 
nicotine. The finer qualities are often poor in nicotine. 

In the examination for a decision on tobacco the following 
points must be especially kept in view : 

1. All manner of leaves are said to be added to tobacco 
(beet, nut, potato, &c.), but the frequence of these falsifica- 
tions seems to have been greatly exaggerated in the older 
books. As in tea the addition is to be detected by macro- 
scopic, but especially by microscopic examination. The leaves 
are previously well boiled in water and rendered transparent 
with potassa-lye. The examination is carried on according 
to the instructions in Moller's book, with the aid of com- 
parative preparations of the most important leaves. I did 
not succeed at Munich in detecting parts of strange plants 



1 88 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

in five samples of the cheapest tobacco bought at poor shops ; 
of course the cheaper sorts contain more stalks. 

The hygienic decision upon such leaves must generally be 
to the effect that nothing is known of a harmful action of 
their smoke. Of course any doubt as to the harmlessness, 
e.g., of potato leaves, will be expressed in the decision as a 
suspicion of their hurtfulness. The smoke of any substitute 
cannot easily be more poisonous than that of tobacco-leaves. 

2. The various colourings and other preparatory agents of 
smoking-tobacco or cigars have scarcely any hygienic im- 
portance, and just as little the ordinary preparation of snuff, 
though the latter is got up to a far greater extent with the 
most heterogeneous sauces, submitted to a more prolonged 
fermentation, and mixed with perfumes. On the other 
hand, all manner of heterogeneous additions are said to be 
frequently used in snuff: powdered wood, glass powder, 
even powdered hellebore, the two last of which must be 
condemned from a hygienic point of view, as they may exert 
violent irritation in an indescribable manner. 

.'). An entire series of seven cases of lead poisoning in 
consequence of snuff being wrapped in lead foil. By reason 
of its acidity the snuff took up as much as 2J per cent, of lead. 

Concerning tin-poisonings by snuff nothing is known. 

5. Spices. 

o63. The examination of the various spices for their 
trade value or purity is the task of the food- and of the 
trade -chemist. The chemical, and especially the micro- 
scopic part of the investigation, often necessitate thorough 
independent study. A knowledge of drugs is also often 
needed for a certain decision. I must here content myself 
with some general remarks, and a reference to the special 
literature of the subject, for here, if anywhere, only the most 
accurate representation can really assist us. The most im- 
portant l spices now in use are for us :

state are noticed here, not the green vegetables used for flavouring soups, &c.

of certain Zingiberaceae, known as ginger, galangals, and 
santonica, 1 also the fruits of similar plants, Cardamons. 

Sophistications and impurities of the entire unground spices 
are in general easy to recognise. Stalks, light grains, and 
sand are at once noticed on picking over a portion, as also 
mouldiness, a musty smell, &c. The following points are 
hygienically important : 

1. Saffron. As genuine saffron costs 12 per kilogramme 
it is falsified to an enormous extent. Entire saffron on soften- 
ing in water shows the characteristic structure of the cornet- 
shaped hyla of the crocus, which in well-preserved specimens 
adhere to the style by threes. Ground saffron is mostly 
falsified. (Kayser found among 127 sorts 114 sophisticated !) 
Hut even entire saffron very often undergoes the most 
varied additions. The presence of the yellow, harmless 
flowers of the marigold (Calendula) and safflower (Cartkamus 
tinctorius) is readily detected by the microscope ; it is best to 
use specimens which have been well boiled in water. Saffron, 
if thrown upon water, colours it, whilst marigold, safflower. 
and various preparations got up with aniline dyes do not 
colour water at all, or but slightly ; genuine saffron may be 
by degrees entirely decolorised with hot water. If scattered 
upon concentrated sulphuric acid every genuine fragment of 
saffron becomes surrounded with a pure blue halo which 
quickly turns brown. Most of the substitutes give a dirty 
yellowish brown colour ; marigold turns to a greenish blue. 
Potassa-lye decolorises saffron and safflower but little; 
marigold takes a characteristic yellowish green. 

The ash of saffron varies from pure white to greyish white, that of 
marigold is intensely green from the presence of manganese ; the ash 
of carthamus is a reddish brown from iron. The ash of saffron contains 
13-">3 per cent, of phosphoric acid, that of salllower 2, and that of mari- 
gold 0'37 per cent. (Ivunt/.e and Hilger;. 

Of the various vegetable additions which decrease the value of the 
sample there may be mentioned : tender rootlets, cut crocus petals, the 
stigmas of maize, the tlowers of Lypcria crocea (Cape saffron), sandal -

spices, far more common, e.y. , than is saffron. Editor.

wood, bark of Scotch firs, flour. To improve the colour the most varied 
pigments have been applied. 

Among the latter there have been already recognised : 
Dinitrokresol potassium, aurantia, Victoria yellow, Martius 
vellow and gold orange, coralline, picric acid, phenylamidoazo- 
benzol-sulphuric acid (Hilger and Kuntze), several of which 
are powerful poisons. The first mentioned, formerly met 
with in commerce as "saffron substitute," has occasioned 
fatal results in human subjects. See 495. 

The diagnosis of these substances is possible only by 
means of the literature of tinctorial substances cited in 
49 5a, and is always difficult. 

For weighting saffron all possible powders have been used, 
after the saffron has been rendered adhesive, e.g., with sugar, 
honey, glycerine. Altogether the falsification of saffron is 
an in exhaustively rich theme. 

2. The alleged substitution of other buds for those of 
capers formerly common e.g., Caltha palmtris, is now pro- 
bably rare ; it is easily detected by the botanist by means of 
the structure of the flowers, and hitherto it has not been of 
hygienic importance. 

3. Vanilla. Falsifications of vanilla consist chiefly in the 
substitution of the inferior wild sorts for the more valuable 
genuine pods. It is also said that samples occur in trade 
which have been extracted, are scented with balsam of 
Peru, and sprinkled over with crystals of benzoic acid. The 
last process is to imitate the valued appearance of many 
genuine kinds which have a natural coating of vanilline, 
which has effloresced or crystallised out. 

The well-known fact that occasionally after the use of 
vanilla (especially vanilla ice-creams) severe poisoning has 
occurred, which takes the type of European cholera, is still 
unexplained. It is said to have been directly shown that the 
use of the vanilla-pod alone, and not a milk-ptomaine, or a 
metallic poison, can have been the cause of the disease. See 
Frankel, Berliner klin. Wochenschrift, 1873. There are two 
possibilities. On the one hand, it is conceivable that vanilla- 
plants which have grown on certain poisonous trees (Jatropha- 



192 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

curcas) yield poisonous pods. To me, the hypothesis seems 
more plausible that a poison is sometimes afterwards 
formed in the vanilla-pod, since all the pods, gathered 
whilst unripe, have to undergo a kind of fermentation. 
Hitherto there is no means, chemical or microscopical, of 
distinguishing a poisonous from a harmless pod. In a very 
remarkable case of poisoning with vanilla ices in America, 
Vaughan succeeded in proving the presence of tyrotoxicoii 
and the non-poisonous character of the vanilla (Arch. f. 
Hygiene, vii.). I believe that in the great majority of cases 
similar explanations are correct. 

In the " vanillism " of the vanilla workers the action of 
vanilla upon the nervous system is complicated with a skin 
disease occasioned by mites. 

The substitution of vanilla-sugar (sugar mixed with artificial vanil- 
line) lias hitherto never been attended with vanilla poisoning, and is 
hygienically to be approved of. 1 

4. The various cases of poisoning with nutmegs seem to 
depend only on the ingestion of irrationally large doses 
(e.g., severe poisoning from the consumption of 1J nutmegs). 

Concerning a peculiar toxicity of the " wild " nutmegs and 
mace which occasionally appear on the market nothing has 
come to my knowledge. 

The wild " Bombay mace " is of a deep reddish-brown 
colour, almost tasteless and inodorous. The colouring-matter 
extracted with alcohol is precipitated by lead acetate in very 
distinct flocks of an intense red. With pure mace there is 
only produced a whitish precipitate. The colouring-matter 
resembles that of turmeric, but may be distinguished by the 
reactions with boric acid (Chemiker Zeitung Rep., 1891, p. 55). 

5. Sophistications of pepper with spurious grains made up 
of flour, paste, pepper-dust, &c., with the addition of capsicum, 
have again repeatedly occurred of late. 

6. The aromatic, harmless fruits of the Japanese Illicium 

1 In view of the rarity and the doubtful origin of the reputed vanilla 
poisonings, we may well demand much more conclusive evidence before taking 
this advice and sacrificing the vanilla plantations of the Seychelles, Mauritius, 
Trinidad, &c. Editor.

verum, Hooker =r Illidum anisatum, Auct, has repeatedly 
given rise to poisoning cases, being confounded with Illidum 
religiosum, which is very similar in structure but poisonous. 
As a spice it seems needless. Much literature on the sub- 
ject : Jahresbericht fur Pharmakogn, 1880, p. 268; 1881-82, 
p. 895; and 1888, p. 72. 

364. The non-specialist, except in signal cases, should 
beware of passing an opinion on the purity of ground spices. 
Certainly a microscopic examination with reference to special 
works will often conduct the experienced observer to his 
object. But even he will often in practice encounter great 
difficulties, as the falsifier can constantly use new and more 
suitable substances, i.e., not yet perfectly examined, brought 
from all parts of the world. We must also remember that 
the dealer, even with every precaution, cannot supply 
absolutely pure wares; occasional strange vegetable cells, 
grains of starch, fibres, particles of dust, and sand will be 
found in every spice. 

That fraud is here carried on systematically is shown, 
e.g., by the following facts. In 1886, at Vienna, 68 per cent, 
of all ground spices were falsified (Nevinny) ; the purest was 
cayenne pepper (20 '5 per cent, of the samples adulterated). 
Cinnamon and pepper were very impure (with respectively 
79 and 86 per cent, of fraudulent samples) ; of the samples of 
cloves 100 per cent, were falsified. The adulterants em- 
ployed were : 

Cereal flours . . 49 cases. | Bread with other matter 8 cases.

194 VEGETABLE ARTICLES FREE FROM ALCOHOL. 

Matta powders from dried pears, bran, certain sorts of millet, 
mildewed barley, and other inferior and certainly often 
unpleasant materials. They are coloured and weighted with 
mineral powders (heavy-spar, calcium carbonate, lead chro- 
mate [!]), and form an especial article of trade. There are 
sorts of different colours, such as pepper-matta, cassia-matta, 
pimento-matta, which are sold at from ^ to ^ of the price of 
the genuine article. 

A favourite fraud is to add, intentionally, the dirt, stalks, 
the light grains, &c., obtained in cleansing the good ware, 
to the other lots intended for grinding. 

An important check on the purity of spices, which is 
available even for an inexperienced observer, is a determina- 
tion of the ash according to the rules of art ( 210). All 
additions of mineral powders, the use of dirty uncleansed 
material and of a great number of substitutes, are detected, 
or at least shown as probable, by the mere determination of 
the ash. 

The polarising microscope also readily detects a number of 
frauds, e.g., in case of pepper. See Hebert, Chem. Zeitung 
Hep. 1891, xv. 84. 

The ninth Congress of Bavarian Chemists in 1890 adopted 
the following resolution : 

1. In the microscopic examination of spices the impalpable 
parts must be separated from the coarser by means of a 
suitable sieve. As far as possible microscopic sections of the 
coarser particles should be prepared and examined. At 
least six separate specimens of the material in question 
should be taken and examined with the microscope. 

The retention of permanent preparations of wares found 
sophisticated or unmarketable is absolutely necessary for the 
purpose of their production as corpus delicti. 

2. In determining the proportion of mineral constituents 
(ash), an elutriation process is recommended according to the 
result of the microscopic examination. 

3. Slight admixtures of single starch grains of the most 
different kinds in ground spices do not interfere with the 
marketable character of the wares concerned. Saffron, with 



SPICES. 195 

which are mixed separated elements of the tissues of the 
style, the leaves, the flower, or other parts, is still to be 
regarded as marketable and not to be condemned. 

An admixture of small quantities of the tissues of clove- 
stalks in cloves leaves the ware still marketable. 

4. In examining ground spices only such samples are to be 
pronounced pure which are perfectly free from every admixture. 

5. The highest limits of the proportion of ash in a ware to 
be considered marketable are : 

Mineral Constituents.

Chillies 5'0 0'5 

All these numbers refer to the air-dried ware. 

The decision on all these falsifications and negligences 
from a hygienic point of view is as follows : Although hitherto 
a danger to health from such manipulations has rarely been 
detected, the physiological efficacy of the spices which play 
an important part in the economy of our nutrition must be 
greatly enfeebled or perhaps altered (e.g. by the substitution 
of flour mixed with chillies for pepper). Secondly, the possi- 
bility exists at any moment that hurtful substitutes may be 
selected by an unscrupulous industry, of which potassium 
dinitrokresol, lead chromate, and mildewed cereal grains can 
already be cited as instances. It is, lastly, unpleasant to 
consume dirt of all kinds in place of clean spices. These 
motives determine us in principle to protest from a hygienic 
point of view against all falsifications of spices.

SECTION XIII. 
BEER.^ 

365. The production of beer is effected, in its main 
features, as follows : 

Barley is steeped for some days in water, then spread out 
on cool floors, and allowed to germinate. The ferment known 
as diastase is formed, and some maltose and dextrine are pro- 
duced from the starch. The green malt thus obtained is 
dried in airy rooms, and is then further more or less dried in 
kilns and separated from the rootlets and plumules. Darker 
malts, so-called " colouring malts," are obtained by roasting 
the kiln- dried malts more strongly. 2 During drying a 
further portion of the starch is converted into dextrine ; 
roasting products are formed ; the diastase is little affected. 

Then follows an infusion of the bruised malt in hot water, 
and the starch is converted by the diastase into maltose. 
This procedure is conducted in different manners in the 
different methods of brewing. The large quantity of diastase 
in malt permits of the addition of unmalted grain, e.y., bruised 
wheat, rice, &c., to increase the proportion of maltose. The 
final result is a brown sweetish liquid, the wort, which is then 
boiled up with hops, " hopped wort," freed from suspended 
flocks of albumenoids by filtration, cooled as rapidly as pos- 
sible, and pumped into the cold fermenting cellars (3 to 4). 
Here the yeast is added, and a moderately rapid alcoholic 
fermentation is produced at the expense of the maltose. 
After the chief fermentation is at an end, the new beer is 

1 The author here refers to so-called "brown beer," formed by bottom 
fermentation. " White beer " he mentions at the end of the section. The 
reader, German or English, who wishes to compare continental methods of 
brewing with those adopted in this country is referred to the English works 
mentioned in the Bibliography. Editor.

respectively at 65 to 76, and at 163 to 22Q.ditor. 



EXAMINATION OF BEER. 199 

carefully drawn off clear from the yeast, which subsides to 
the bottom, and is filled into store-casks, in which it under- 
goes a slow second fermentation in the store-cellar at 1. 
When this second fermentation is over the casks are bunged 
up, and the yeast is allowed to deposit. 

From the maltthe beer derives maltose, dextrine, albumenoids, 
and salts ; from the hops, resins, tannin, and a bitter principle. 
The fermentation produces besides alcohol and carbonic acid 
a little glycerine and succinic acid, and the salts of the water 
used in the process reappear. But the presence of a little 
lactic and acetic acid may always be detected, evidently in 
consequence of a schizomycetic fermentation. 

In Bavaria, beer (brown beer), in virtue of a law recently formulated 
(May 18, 1868), may be prepared only from barley- malt, hops, and 
water, with the aid of yeast. As the malt-duty, a rather high tax 
charged per hectolitre of malt, is in Bavaria an important part of the 
public revenue, every use of substitutes for barley-malt crushed wheat, 
wheat-malt, rice, starch, sugar, &c. or of foreign additions in general, 
is punishable as a fraud on the revenue, whether or not it involves an 
infraction of the German law on articles of food or against the demands 
of hygiene. This fiscal regulation will, of course, not engage our 
attention. 1 

A. Examination of Beer. 

366. The most important determinations to be made in 
beer (expressed as x grin, in 100 grm. of beer) are : 

1. Determination of the specific gravity at 15. 

2. Determination of the proportion of alcohol = A. 

3. Determination of the extract = E. Extract is the 
sum of the non-volatile constituents. This magnitude is 
also expressed as extract residue, as it represents the residue 
of the extractive substances of the wort which have not been 
volatilised as carbonic acid during fermentation. 

4. Determination of the concentration of the wort = e. 
As on fermentation about two parts by weight of sugar 
yield one part of alcohol, by doubling the alcohol found in the 
beer, and adding it to the extract as found, we may calculate 

1 As long as the malt-tax existed in this country the British law on brew- 
ing materials was similar to that of Bavaria. Editor. 



200 BEER. 

approximately how much extract the wort contained before 
fermentation set in. We find, e.g., in the example carried 
out in the following pages, 3*43 per cent, of alcohol and 
7-64 per cent, of extract: (3-43 X 2) + 7'64 = 14*50. This 
figure would be accurate enough for a rapid expression, but 

100 (E+ 2-0665 x^) 
by means of the formula - m ~+ T0665 x A m&y 

calculate the original extract accurately : 

100 (7-64 + 2-0665 x 343) _ 
~ 100 + 1-0665 x 3-43 

5. Comparison of the degree of fermentation (V). By 
this we understand the proportion of the quantity of extract 
e E (converted into alcohol and carbonic acid) to the total 
e contained in the wort.

i. Taking Samples of Beer for Examination. 

367. As beer, if not drawn sccundum artem, quickly 
passes into a modified and useless condition, the following 
rules must be observed : 

Beer is drawn into new litre bottles of green glass l (wine- 
bottles, not jugs). The bottles, and also the corks, are laid 
previously for an hour in boiling water, then carefully drained 
and allowed to cool, filled with beer at the tap, duly corked 
and sealed. The beer must be examined at once ; on pro- 
longed transmission, especially in hot weather, beer, even taken 
as above, will be quickly somewhat changed. For despatch in 
summer the bottles must be packed in ice. Hilger asserts 
that only beer which is already changing (turbid) becomes 

1 The action of light promotes the decomposition of beer. 



SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 201 

perceptibly worse on a journey. Good beer scarcely suffers 
at all by transmission in bottles in summer to great distances 
without ice. 

For bacteriological examination beer is best taken at the bung-hole 
by means of a large sterilised pipette, and is then examined exactly 
like water ( 200), filled into flasks or bottles, and immediately ex- 
amined further ( 374). Large store- vats, in which the bung-hole is not 
easily accessible, are specially tapped at the side, and the fine stream 
escaping is received in sterilised vessels. 

2. Examination with the Senses. 

368. Beer is either quite clear (bright) or it shows a 
more or less distinct opalescence dust-like turbidity, faint 
dimness, strong dimness ; if the transparence is further 
decreased it is said to be muddy. 

Causes of turbidity may be : 

1. Yeast or bacteria. Often both mixed ; the most frequent kind of 
turbidity. Easily recognised by the microscope ; by means of counting 
plates Wahl found in bright beer 5, in " fine " beer 18, in " dusty-turbid " 
beer 82 yeast microbia per cubic centimetre. Emmerich found in beer 
moderately turbid with yeast 3900 per cubic centimetre. According to 
Lindner (Centralblattf. Bakteriologie, viii. 697) turbity is often occasioned 
by Sarcinae. 

2. Resins. Yellowish granules and crumbs with intervening drops 
of oil, which dissolve under the microscope in an excess of alcohol or 
readily in potassa-lye. Rare. 

3. Albumenoid bodies. Flocculent turbidities which take a yellow 
colour with iodine. 

4. Starches and dextrines. No distinct microscopic image ; if pre- 
cipitated by five volumes of alcohol, collected on a filter, and dissolved 
in a little water, they give a violet red, or red colour with iodised 
potassium iodide. 

The examination of the taste and smell is important. An 
acid taste shows the necessity of testing for acetic acid 
( 371); a taste or odour of sulphurous acid, mouldiness, 
&c., indicate examination in these directions. 

3. Specific Gravity. 

369. The beer, after it has been brought approximately 
to the temperature fixed for weighing, is well shaken in a 
flask half filled, to expel carbonic acid, and filtered through 



202 BEER. 

wadding to remove froth. The specific gravity is taken to 
the fourth place with the pycnometer ( 20) or Westphal's 
balance. Araeometers are not sufficiently accurate. 

As pycnometers we use, in. preference to the instrument 
described ( 20), small bottles with a long narrow neck, 
holding about 50 cc. of beer. The neck has a fine gradua- 
tion, by means of which the quantity introduced can be read 
off very accurately, without the necessity of filling the 
bottle each time up to one fixed mark. Before use the 
pycnometer must be gauged by ascertaining how much it 
weighs when empty, and what is its weight when filled up 
successively to different degree-marks with water at 15. 

We find the pycnometer empty = 1 1 '45 1 3. 

full to mark = 60-9759. Contents alone = 49 '5246. 

20 = 61-1859. =49-7346. 

, 54 = 61-5463. =50'0950. 

60 = 61-6105. =50-1592. 

We can easily draw up a table by interpolation. The difference of 
weight, e.g., at mark and mark 20 = 0'210. If we divide this number 
by 20, we find as the first part of the table : 

Volume at mark = 49'5246 cc. 

1=49-5246 + 0-0105. 

2 = 49-5246 + 2 x 0'0105, &c. 

Between the degrees 20 and 54 the increase per degree is 0"0106 cc. ; 
between 54 arid 60 = 0'0107 cc. 

The weight of the empty pycnometer should often be checked, as it 
gradually decreases by the solution of portions of the glass. 

Both when gauging the pycnometer, and when using it 
for the examination of beer, everything depends on the liquids 
having the exact temperature of 15. They are brought as 
nearly as possible to this temperature. The pycnometer, 
before reading off, is placed for fifteen minutes in water at 
15, and the result is read off whilst standing in the water, 
touching merely the neck with the warm fingers. Before 
weighing, the pycnometer must be carefully dried both 
externally and internally if any moisture adheres to the 
neck above the level of the liquid ; any change of volume 
thus occasioned is indifferent, since the volume has been read 
off, and the weight is not affected. 



ALCOHOL. 203 

Example. The above pycnometer full of beer to the mark 41 weighs : 
62-4790, contains therefore 62-4790 - 11-4513 = 51 "0277 grm. of beer. 
According to the table it holds up to the mark 49*9572 cc. of water ; 
the specific gravity of the beer is therefore 51*0277 : 49 -95 72 = 1 '02 14. 



4. Alcohol. 

370. We weigh in a weighed flask 75 c.c. of beer 
correctly to the second decimal ; pour the beer into the 
distilling-flask ( 3), rinsing the weighing-flask out with 
about 10 c.c. of water, and distil the alcohol with good con- 
densation into a long-necked pycnometer until the distillate 
amounts to about two-thirds the volume of the beer. The 
condensation-tube of the refrigerator is drawn out into a 
long point leading to a funnel placed in the neck of the 
pycnometer. The distillation is conducted carefully with a 
small flame, so as to avoid frothing over; if this danger 
threatens, a high foam rising up on the surface of the 
liquid, the flame is withdrawn until the froth has subsided, 
when the distillation can generally be continued with safety. 
In the worst case the apparatus must be allowed to cool, the 
flask opened, and a knife-point full of tannin must be added. 
In this case the residue cannot be used for the examination 
of extract. 

If the liquid in the pycnometer has risen up into the neck 
it is placed for a quarter of an hour in water at 15, the 
volume is read off, the vessel is dried and weighed as above, 
and the proportion of alcohol is found from the Baumhauer- 
Holzner table (Table XIV.). 

Example. Flask with 75 cc. beer = 106 '75 grm., empty flask = 30'15 
grm., therefore 76'60 grm. beer have been used. The same pycnometer 
as above was employed. When filled up to the mark 54 with alcohol 
distillate it weighed 61 '0840. Therefore the distillate alone = 61 '0840 - 
11-4513 = 49-6327. According to the table of corrections the pycno- 
meter up to the mark 54 contains 50'0950 water, therefore the specific 
gravity of the alcohol, 49-6327 : 50*0950 = 0'99077. According to 
Table XIV. this corresponds to alcohol at 5 '29 per cent, by weight. 
Considering that the 49 '632 7 grm. distillate have been obtained 
from 76'6 grin, of beer, the actual percentage of alcohol of the beer 
49-6327 x 5-29 

= ** "-is 7 i 3er cent - "y wei ght. 



204 BEER. 

5. Determination of Extract. 

75 cc. of beer weighed in a flask are carefully evaporated 
down to two-thirds in a capsule on the water-bath, or on an 
asbestos plate, rinsed again into the flask with distilled water, 
and made up to the original weight. If no tannin has been 
added, the residue obtained on determining the alcohol may 
be employed. The specific gravity of the beer thus watered or 
freed from alcohol is again determined, and the proportion of 
extract in percentages by weight can be read off in Schulze- 
Ostermann's table (Table XIII.). 

In the above example the residue after distillation was poured back 
into the flask, rinsed, and so much water added that the flask with its 
contents again weighed exactly 206 '75 grin. The contents of the flask 
are poured into a dry beaker, mixed, and the pycnometer used above is 
filled again after it has been previously rinsed out twice with the de- 
alcoholised beer. The reading showed, e.g., contents up to mark 32 ; 
according to the table, the pycnometer holds up to this degree 49 '86 18 
grin, water at 15. The pycnometer when empty weighs 11 '4513, and 
with the de-alcoholised beer, 62*7958 r/rw. Hence the specific gravity is 

'49-&G18 ~ = 1*0297. According to Schultze-Ostermann's table, 

this corresponds to 7 '6382 per cent, of extract by weight. 



6. Acid (Total Acid, Carbonic Acid, Acetic Acid). 

371. Every beer has naturally an acid reaction in con- 
sequence of the free acids and acid salts which it invariably 
contains. It is hence perverse to object to beer as acid as 
it is said to have happened because it reddens litmus-paper. 

According to a general agreement, the total acidity is 
ascertained by first expelling from 100 cc. of shaken beer the 
free carbonic acid by heating for ten minutes to 40 in an 
uncovered beaker, then titrating with one-fifth normal baryta- 
water, continuing to add until a drop of the beer no longer 
reddens neutral lilac litmus-paper. The determination is 
always to be effected in duplicate, and a drop of distilled 
water must be placed as a check upon a slip of litmus-paper 
in order to compare the colour of moist neutral litmus-paper. 

Total acidity is expressed either by the number of cubic 



GLYCERINE. 205 

centimetres of normal lye which are consumed by 100 grin. 
beer, or as grammes of lactic acid in 100 grm. of beer ; 1 cc. 
normal lye saturates 0'09 grin, lactic acid. 

If, therefore, 100 cc. have consumed 10'2 cc. of one-fifth normal solution 
of baryta, the total acidity corresponds (if the beer has the specific 

gravity l'015)-g 1-Q15 == Q' 1 ^ 2 P er cent - l ac tic acid. 

It is important to ascertain the presence of other volatile 
acids beside carbonic acid. Acetic acid especially can some- 
times be found in considerable quantities. The quantity of 
volatile acid is expressed by the number of cubic centimetres 
of normal soda-lye consumed by the distillate of 100 grm. of 
beer. 

We work with the Landmann apparatus (212, Fig. 84). Water in 
full ebullition is poured into the flask a, and 100 cc. beer in the flask 
b. The volatile acids driven over along with the watery vapour are 
collected in d. It is useful to pass through the cork of b a tall and 
moderately wide upright tube, open above and below, dipping into the 
water. It affords safety against the reflux of the contents of the beer- 
flask if from any cause the water should cease boiling. 

For the determination of carbonic acid (rarely performed) 
we perforate the cork of the bottle with a tube of brass or 
steel, closed with a cock, and provided with a wide, globular 
enlargement. The cock is cautiously opened by degrees, and 
the escaping carbonic acid is received in baryta-water as in 
179 a. Afterwards the cock is entirely opened, and the 
contents of the bottle are heated in the water-bath. It is 
necessary to have small beer-bottles and large receivers of 
baryta-water. 

7. Glycerine. 

372. 50 cc. of beer are mixed with about 3 grm. of caustic lime, evapo- 
rated down to a syrup, then mixed with about 10 grm. of coarsely 
powdered marble or sea-sand, and evaporated to dryness. The entire 
dry residue is pulverised and placed in a capsule of filter paper, which 
is introduced into an extracting apparatus and extracted f o:? six to eight 
hours with not more than 50 cc. of strong alcohol. To the extract 
obtained, which is of a pale colour, there is added at least an equal 
volume of anhydrous ether ; and the solution, after standing for a 
time,, is poured into a weighed flask and filtered through a small filter, 



206 BEER. 

and washed with a little alcohol-ether. After evaporating off the 
alcohol-ether, the residue is dried in the desiccation closet at 100-105, 
loosely covered until the weight becomes constant. In beers which are 
very rich in extract, the ash from the glycerine is determined and 
deducted. If sugar is present in the glycerine, it also is to be deter- 
mined according to Soxhlet and deducted. 



8. Maltose, Dextrine, Nitrogen, Ash, Preservative 
Agents. 

Maltose ( 220), dextrine (same section), nitrogen ( 212), ash ( 210). 
Very slow combustion and the avoidance of bright redness are absolutely 
necessary. A determination of the ash is required for the detection of 
an addition of sodium bicarbonate. Sulphurous acid ( 228), salicylic 
acid ( 229). 

9. Substitutes for Hops. 

373. The substances enumerated in 380 can be sought 
for with success only by a critical chemist. A parallel expe- 
riment must always be made with pure beer. Dragendorff, 
in concert with liis pupils, has worked out the methods very 
carefully. For Dragendorff 's original memoir see Medicus, 
Nalirungsmittcl, p. 112. Compare further Adams, The 
Analyst, 1890, p. 121; and Allen and Chattaway, The 
Analyst, 1890, p. 181. 

Two methods only can be here described : 

1. According to Dragendorff, a falsification of beer may 
sometimes be detected as follows : It is evaporated down to 
the half, mixed with an excess of basic lead acetate, rapidly 
filtered, and the filtrate mixed with a few drops of a solution 
of gelatine (1 : 20) and sulphuric acid, exactly enough for the 
precipitation of the lead. If the filtrate has a bitter taste, 
substitutes must be further sought for. 

2. Detection of Picric Acid according to Fleck. 500 cc. of 
beer are evaporated to the consistence of a syrup, the residue 
extracted with ten times its volume of absolute alcohol, the 
latter filtered off, and the filter well washed with alcohol. 
The alcohol thus obtained is evaporated, the residue boiled in 
water, the water of the filtrate evaporated away, the residue 
extracted with ether, and the extract evaporated. The 



NUTRITIVE VALUE. 



207 



residue re-crystallised from chloroform consists only of picric 
acid, and may be weighed. If the residue is finally covered 
with a solution of potassium cyanide and caustic potassa and 
dried on the water-bath, there appears a blood-red spot of 
isopurpuric acid. 3 mgrm. may be determined in 1 litre of 
beer. 

10. Bacteriological Examination of Beer. 

374 This is effected exactly as that of water (sample to 
be taken according to 367), using the gelatine - wort 
described in 58. 

The investigation has rather a zy mo-technical than a 
hygienic meaning. Besides the schizomycetes (which princi- 
pally form acids, and especially lactic and acetic acids), 
among which pediococci and sarcinse play a prominent part 
(Lindner), there occur here various saccharomycetes and 
hyphomycetes. See Jorgensen, Die Mikro-organismen der 
Gdhrungsindustrie, 2nd edition, Berlin, 1890, with biblio- 
graphic references in detail. Numerous researches are given 
in abstract in the CentralUatt f. Bakteriologie. 

It may here be indicated that the various species and 
forms of yeast are now used in pure cultures for the produc- 
tion of beer, and that " wild yeasts " are recognised as chief 
enemies to the production of good beer. See 92 and 368.

208 BEER. 

It would be useless to give the limit values of the hundreds 
of analyses, as both the minimum and the maximum figures 
present quite abnormal values. In consequence of the abun- 
dant proportion of sugar and dextrine, and the appreciable 
amount of albumen, beer has decidedly a nutritive value 
which is not insignificant. Even the alcohol, setting its 
toxic signification on one side, must be viewed as a nutritive 
substance. 

Hygiene must of course pronounce figures which fall below 
the mean standard of draught beer as inadmissible, since its 
interest is that the nutritive value of this important means of 
popular enjoyment and nutrition (especially for women after 
a confinement, convalescents, &c.) should not be diminished. 
Beers containing less than 3 per cent, of alcohol, and 11 per 
cent, concentration of wort, 1 must be pronounced weak, of 
inferior value, and not calculated to keep. In Bavaria at 
least 11 - 8 were formerly prescribed for draught beer, and for 
lager beer at least 13 '7 per cent, extract of the original wort 
(concentration of wort). A^ogel says, " Though this stipula- 
tion has long ago ceased to be legally valid, the conviction 
has gradually made its way everywhere that these values 
must be preserved, at least in beers of the Bavarian char- 
acter." Bock is boiled down to 15 to 10, and Salvator to from 
17 to 18 - 5 per cent. Beers which, instead of being made 
from malt alone, receive an addition of starch, maltose, potato 
sugar, &c., in the wort, are relatively poorer in nitrogenous sub- 
stances, ash, and especially in phosphoric acid. This, indeed, 
may be pronounced a somewhat trifling disadvantage, since 
the 7 '4 rjrm. of albumen contained in 1 litre of malt beer can 
be reduced at furthest to one-half, whence the balance of 
nutrition will not be much affected. According to the agree- 

O O 

ments of the Bavarian chemists the extract of normal beers 
usually contains 1 per cent, nitrogen = 6*25 per cent, albu- 
men. Konig, on the other hand, assumes 12 to 13 per cent. ; 
O'Go per cent, of nitrogen is, according to the agreements, 
the very lowest limit. 



1 The Swiss chemists demand 12 per cent. 



SOUR, FLAT, "LONG," AND TURBID BEER. 209 

2. Beer which is too New. 

376. If the calculation of the degree of fermentation 
( 366) shows less than 48 per cent., it is to be pronounced 
insufficiently fermented (too recent). Such beer may have 
a direct injurious action. Firstly, in consequence of the pro- 
portion of hop-resin (or of constituents of the hop which are 
imperfectly known, and which act directly upon the urinary 
organs). Spasm of the bladder, irritation of the urethra, &c., 
are symptoms identical with those produced by decoctions of 
hops (Mori., Arch. f. Hygiene, vii.). Not until the further 
course of fermentation are these resins satisfactorily pre- 
cipitated out of the beer. 

Hygiene cannot express satisfaction that the Bavarian 
chemists on July 18, 1891, resolved in future to require 
only a degree of fermentation of 44 per cent., " as the tech- 
nical advances in the brewing industry permit such beer to 
be satisfactorily produced, and as it suits better the present 
taste of the drinking public." 

On the chemistry of hops see Greslioff, Chemisclie Studien uber 
Hopfen. Allgem. Brauer und Hopfenzeitung, 1887, No. 83, where the 
researches of the author and others are carefully given ; also Bungener 
and Lintner, Zeit. /. das gesammte Brauwesen, 1891, p. 358. 

In " beers of luxury " (luxus biere) the degree of fermen- 
tation may descend to 45 per cent. ; even at this degree the 
alcohol and extract are abundant enough to produce a beer 
which will keep. Of course the ash, glycerine, &c., will be 
increased in a proportion corresponding to the extract or to 
the alcohol, 

3. Sour, Flat, " Long " Beer, and such as is Rendered 
Turbid by Yeast. 

377. Such beers are no longer enjoyable, and may be 
condemned on this account. Properties hurtful to health 
are also possible. It is evidently at times doubtful whether 
a beer is to be referred to one of these categories, when we 
must proceed according to the following points of view : 



VOL. II. 






210 BEER. 

Sour Beer. L. Aubiy, taking his standing upon abundant 
experience, proposed the following theses on sour beer at the 
fifth free convention of Bavarian chemists at Wiirzburg. See 
also the transactions of the sixth convention at Munich, in 
which the same views were maintained by Aubry and H. 
Vogel. 

1. Any beer which is characterised by a strikingly sour and 
bad taste, having an acidity exceeding 3 cc. of normal alkali 
( = 0'27 grin, lactic acid per 100 grm. beer), and in the sedi- 
ment and suspended matter of which acid bacteria can be 
shown in a quantity large, as compared with the yeast, must 
be pronounced acid. 

2. Every beer the total acidity of which does not exceed 
the limit fixed in the agreement, but which contains an 
excess of acetic acid, is to be considered as acid if the quantity 
of the latter from 100 cc. of beer requires for neutralisation 
more than 1 cc. of decinormal soda-lye, i.e., when it contains 
O'OOG grin, acetic acid. 

According to the views of Vogel and Aubry it is sometimes 
chiefly the lactic acid, and sometimes rather the acetic acid 
which gives beer a sour taste. 

Eckenroth found beers from the Palatinate and from 
^Munich which were by no means to be regarded as sour, for 
which .r5 cc. of decinormal soda-lye were necessary to 
neutralise the distillate. He proposes not to regard a beer 
as sour unless more than 5'0 cc. are requisite. 

For healthy persons sour beers are doubtless often harm- 
less, but for convalescents and for persons with sensitive 
digestive organs they are always hazardous. 

Flat Beer. If beer has stood for some time, especially at a 
rather high temperature, it loses its carbonic acid, becomes 
warm and ill tasting, and is no longer enjoyable. Here be- 
long especially dribblings of casks and leavings of beer, which 
unconscientious publicans sometimes collect and sell again. 
Such beer is exceedingly offensive. In general, such beer is 
also sour and spoiled, and may be unwholesome. 

' Long " Beer. Beer is rendered " long " by certain schizo- 
mycetes (Yon Laer, Wockensckrift f. Bmucrei. 1889, p. 1006). 



SOUR, FLAT, "LONG," AND TURBID BEER. 211 

To my knowledge it has never yet proved injurious to health, 
but it is not appetising. 

378. Beer rendered Turbid ~by Yeast. At the conventions 
cited in 377, the Bavarian representatives of applied chem- 
istry resolved, on the motion of Aubry and H. Vogel, that 

1. Beers which are but slightly fermented must, for con- 
sumption, be perfectly free from yeast, i.e., yeast must not 
be present in them in the form of turbidity. 

2. Beers which have been thoroughly fermented, which 
have at least 48 per cent, of true fermentation, and which 
are otherwise of a normal character, are admissible for use 
with a slight opacity; it must, however, not be so strong 
that a perceptible deposit of yeast appears on standing for 
twenty-four hours at the temperature of a dwelling-room. 

3. Beers which are strongly turbid in consequence of yeast, 
and which deposit much yeast, are unfit for use. 

4. Yeasty beers are to be regarded as spoiled only if along 
with the yeasts bacteria are abundantly present, if a chemical 
examination shows scope for continued decomposition (acidi- 
fication), and if at the same time the taste is bad. 

Concerning the hurtfulness of yeasty beers, we knew, until 
lately, very little of a positive nature. It is certain in country 
districts that much yeasty beer is still consumed in summer 
without injury ; that in the beers of Ziegenhain and Lich- 
tenhain in Thuringia large quantities of yeast are drunk with 
pleasure the beer is so turbid that it looks unpleasant in 
glasses, and is therefore drunk out of wooden cups. In like 
manner we drink entire masses of yeast in fermenting must. 
The French prisoners at Ingolstadt received in 1871 daily each 
two tablespoonfuls of beer-yeast to prevent scurvy, " with the 
best success." On the other hand, we cannot doubt that the 
use of yeasty beers often gives rise to severe intestinal 
catarrh. See Simanowsky, Ueber die Gcsundheitsscliddlichkeit 
hefetruber Biere (Arch. f. Hygiene, iv.). 

The question has been greatly advanced by Neumayer at 
the Hygienic Institute at Munich (Arch.f. Hygiene, xii.). He 
has proved by an extensive series of experiments on lower 



212 BEER. 

animals and on men that yeast (twelve different kinds) is 
perfectly harmless, even in very large doses (8 and even 30 
firm, daily), without the presence of some fermentable sub- 
stance. If taken with thoroughly fermented beer it produces 
for the most part merely slight disturbances, but all kinds of 
yeast have an injurious action if large doses of yeast and 
copious supplies of fermentable substances (new beer, sac- 
charine solution, &c.) are taken simultaneously. Neumayer 
proved that both in vitro and in the stomach the process of 
fermentation at 37 generates abnormal products (fusel oils), 
and substances of an intensely bitter taste, which may have a 
poisonous action. 

The observations of Simanowsky show that every new, 
yeasty beer must at least be regarded as hurtful to health. 
Under all circumstances beers, which are generally drunk 
clear, are not appetising if turbid, whether the turbidity is 
due to yeast or other suspended matter. 

For clarifying turbid beers the following harmless agents 
are permissible (see Verhandl. der Bayer. Chemiker in 
Number g, 1885) : 

Filtering apparatus, shavings of beech or hazel well boiled 
out, isinglass, Raja clavata, and good gelatine. If the clari- 
fying agents are kept for a long time in solution they often 
spoil and become unpleasant if not injurious. 

4. The Use of Substitutes, Preservative Agents, 
Effervescing Powders, Sodium Bicarbonate. 

379. If we take up fully and entirely the point of view 
that a beverage consisting purely of barley-malt, water, and 
hops is to be considered as the ideal of beer, and if we grate- 
fully recognise the beneficial results of the Bavarian malt- 
tax for the character and the universal reputation of Bavarian 
beer, the following considerations are drawn up from a 
general hygienic point of view in agreement with the purpose 
of the book, according to which not everything prohibited on 
grounds of national economy or fiscal policy is directly hostile 
to health. 



THE USE OF SUBSTITUTES, &c. 213 

Substitutes for Barley-malt. Various cereals (wheat, rice, 
maize, malted or unlimited, potato- starch, maltose, glucose). 
On the nutritive value of such beer, see 375 ; on the 
question of the unwholesomeness of glucose and the products 
of its fermentation, see Wine. 

All beers brewed with substitutes for malt are said to have 
the property of retaining carbonic acid very imperfectly. 
Whilst malt beers contain abundance of carbonic acid at from 
12 to 15 and have a good taste, the substitute beers must be 
cold as ice if they are not quickly to become flat by the escape 
of C0 2 . This is a great hygienic disadvantage, since beer 
which is too cold readily produces catarrh of the intestines. 

Glycerine. If we find more than 0'25 per cent, of glycerine 
in beer, it has very probably been added artificially. The 
addition of glycerine makes the beer sweeter, seemingly 
richer and fuller in the mouth. An addition of 1 to 2 yrm. 
of glycerine per litre is probably not to be regarded as 
injurious to health, but to many persons this perfectly ex- 
traneous addition will appear repulsive. Further, only weak, 
poor beer will be provided with this addition, and may probably 
be regarded at once as badly brewed, ill-fermented, or spoiled. 

How much glycerine beer may contain as a minimum 
cannot yet be said. According to Borgmann and Egger, to 
100 alcohol there belong about 5 '5 to 3*8 glycerine ; latterly, 
in beers prepared with pure cultures of yeast, the glycerine 
has been reduced to 2 '63 per 100 parts of alcohol. 

Decoction of Liquorice (for the chemical detection see 
Kayser, Eep. d. Anal. Chem., 1884, No. 4, and H. Vogel, 
Verhandl. der Bayer. Chem. in Nurnberg, 1885, p. 89). From 
a hygienic point of view this substitute may be judged 
similar to the addition of glycerine in small quantities, i.e., it 
is harmless but alien, and scarcely appetising. 

Saccharine must be judged hygienically according to 354. 
It should be strictly prohibited in brewing, for by its sweeten- 
ing power it enables beers poor in extract to assume the 
character of the valuable Bock or Salvator beers, rich in 
extract (K. B. Lehmann). The excuse that saccharine is 
used merely for preservation is foolish. 



214 BEER. 

. Beer-colour and Colouring-malt. According as the malt 
used has been strongly or lightly dried the beer is darker or 
lighter. To produce dark beers strongly roasted colour-malt 
is added directly to the malt or to the wort, or there is used 
an extract of high-coloured malt, "beer colour." Under the 
name "patent colour malt" there has come into use a malt 
pale on the surface, but dark brown inwardly. Its use pro- 
tects against an empyreumatic flavour, but it may easily 
introduce more or less raw starch into the beer. Instead of 
these colouring agents there is often used, especially if the 
beer turns out too pale, "beer colour," i.e., burnt sugar (cane- 
sugar or starch-sugar). There is no certain chemical test 
to show whether the one or the other colour has been used. 
Hygiene has nothing to object to these colouring-matters if 
they have been properly prepared from appetising materials 
and are not spoiled. It can ascribe no value to the circum- 
stance that an extract of coloured malt contains a little more 
nutritious matter than the quantity of beer colour which 
gives the same shade. But very dark beers must be viewed 
with some suspicion, since the colour (especially formerly) 
might often simulate a strongly concentrated wort ; and, 
secondly, according to experience, it is sometimes added to con- 
ceal turbidities of different kinds. The position of chemists 
and zymoteclmicists on the colour question is still not fully 
explained, but it is discussed in the Transaction of the fourth 
free Association of Bavarian Chemists at Kiirenbenr. 

O 

Guyot alleges that he has found methyl-orange in beer at 
Paris. 



380. Substitutes for Iltyis. The hop has three functions 
in beer. Firstly, it gives a bitter aromatic taste ; secondly. 
its tannin promotes the elimination of various albumenoids, 
i.e., clarification; and lastly, it has preservative qualities. As 
hops in many seasons are rather dear, the idea was obvious 
to substitute for them other bitter, and, to some extent, tan- 
niferous substances, of which we mention : 

Artemisia absynthium (wormwood), Leclnm pnlustre (marsh -rosemary), 
Altnyanthes trifuliata (bitter clover), Coronilla scorpioidea, Buxus semper- 



THE USE OF SUBSTITUTES, &c. 215 

rirens (box-tree), Cnicus benedictus (lioly thistle), Erythrcea centaurium 
(centaury), the roots of species of gentians, the bark of Quassia amara 
and species of willow, the fruits and seeds of Colchicum autumnale, 
Anamirta cocculus (Cocculus indicus), Capsicum annuum, the pith of 
colocynths, the resin of aloes, and lastly even picric acid. 

Of the above-mentioned drugs some are probably harmless 
(willow-bark, gentian, centaury), some more questionable 
(Ledum, Artemisia, Buxus), and a number intensely poison- 
ous (Colchicum, Menispermum cocculus, containing picrotoxin) ; 
substances containing strychnine are said to have been used ; l 
picric acid is a formidable poison, 04 grm. of which produce 
serious symptoms. In view of the difficulty of distinguishing 
these bitters chemically, and the dangerous character of a 
number of them, a general prohibition of them would be 
very judicious. No exception should be made even for the 
harmless kinds, as they diminish the enjoyable character of 
the beer. The hop certainly contains poisons ( 376), but 
the experience of centuries has taught us that no danger is 
to be apprehended if it is used according to the rules of art. 

Ferraud and Chevalier (Journal de Chemie et de Pharmacie, 1868) 
allege that at that time the beer at Lyon was invariably mixed with 
picric acid, in consequence of which they were attacked with illness. 
Colchicin has often been really or in supposition found in beer, as also 
buxin. But as in notoriously pure beers substances have been found 
which act like curare, the utmost caution is requisite in the chemical 
interpretation of the results obtained ; many able chemists express 
themselves very doubtingly whether such substances have been really 
found of late in Germany. See, e.g., L. A. Buchner, Friedr&ich's Blatter^ 
1883, p. 81. 

Sodium Bicarbonate. Its use is probable if the proportion 
of ash exceeds 0'3 per cent., 2 or on titration the total acidity 
is found less 1'5 cc. normal alkali per 100 beer. As soon as 
an addition of sodium bicarbonate is proved the beer is to be 
judged as if sour, i.e., it is suspected of being unwholesome. 
The addition often serves directly to promote the decompo- 
sition of the beer ; compare Milk, 284.

are concerned. Editor.

216 BEER. 

Effervescing Powders. Publicans sometimes seek to give 
flat beer the semblance of freshness by means of so-called 
effervescing powders, containing tartaric acid, along with 
sodium bicarbonate, which develop carbonic acid in the beer. 
This is detected, like the bicarbonate, by the proportion of 
ash. The decision is the same as that on flat beer it is 
unpleasant, and, if spoiled, may be directly unwholesome. 

APPENDIX L DRAWING BEER. 

| 381. If much beer is drawn, and a cask is quickly 
emptied, the most rational procedure is to draw it with a brass 
or wooden cock. On. the lead in the cocks see Section 
XVIII. 

In many cases it is desired always to draw beer which 
foams briskly, although the cask may only be slowly emptied. 
To this end air is forced into the cask by a pump, with the 
advantage that the beer is forced into the taproom by atmos- 
pheric pressure in tubes of tin or caoutchouc. Hygiene 
disapproves of these arrangements, because very frequently 

1. The impure air of the room is forced into the beer, 
which must be regarded as unpleasant. 

2. If an air-receiver is introduced, the air readily comes in 
contact with rancid oil. 

3. The beer stagnates in the narrow pipes, and takes up 
metal from the lead pipes (which are often strongly plum- 
biferous), or odorous (mal-odorous) matters from the caout- 
chouc pipes. 

4. The entire beer-engine, unless very frequently cleansed, 
gets into a condition of loathsome dirtiness. 

These evils are in part not easy of removal. It is better, 
instead of the beer-engines, to screw a cylinder of liquefied 
carbonic acid upon the casks remaining in the cellar, by 
which pure carbonic acid gas exerts the pressure, and no 
impurity finds its way into the beer. Lintner found that the 
beer drawn with carbonic acid from a 40-litre barrel was 
unimpeachable after several days (Lintner, Zeit.f. d. Gesamint. 
Brauwesen., vol. viii., New Series, No. 5). The temperature 



WHITE BEER. 217 

of draught beer should lie between 10 and 15; if warmer 
its taste is unpleasant, and if colder it is apt to disagree. 
The ideal of beer-drawing is, however, direct tapping from 
the cask without pipes, &c., the cask standing in a cool, airy 
locality, free from smoke. If it is intended to use com- 
pressed carbonic acid as above described, care must be taken 
that the beer comes as little as possible in contact with pipes 
or tubes. 

APPENDIX II. SMALL BEER. 

382. Small Beer (convent, schops, 1 &c.). There are 
drawn thin beers for workmen and servants, containing only 
1 to 2 per cent, extract, about 1 per cent, of alcohol, O'OG 
to 0*08 of ash, and which require for neutralising 100 grm. 
00 '3 to 00*5 cc. normal alkali. They are obtained by a re- 
peated extraction of the malt which has been once used for 
ordinary beer, and treating this thin wort as for beer. The 
keeping properties of this liquid are very low, and it readily 
becomes yeasty and sour. Schops is often made by simply 
watering beer, which on any account (incipient decomposition) 
is scarcely saleable. 

It is examined like beer ; the principal point for the 
hygienist to decide is whether it is sour or not. This point 
is found according to the rules given for brown beer. See 
Prior, Zur Beurtheiluny der Naclibiere ; Bericht iiber die 
Sechste Versammlung der freien Verein. Bayer. Chem. in 
Miinchen. 1887. 



APPENDIX I II. WHITE BEER. 

383. By white beer 2 we understand an acidulous bever- 
age, chiefly obtained from barley and wheat malt by rapid 
top-fermentation, the properties of which differ much at 
different places. It is mostly sold in bottles. According to 

1 For complete analysis see Table X. Convent, kofent, schops, German 
names for small beer. 

2 For complete analysis see Table X. 



218 BEER. 

the resolution of the Bavarian chemists at Niirnberg, 1885, 
when white beer is required in bottles in a briskly efferves- 
cent state and clear, an addition of an enlivening material is 
necessary in the form of cane sugar. Only by this means 
can a productive secondary fermentation be kept up in the 
bottles, as the main fermentation almost entirely consumes 
the fermentable material.

SECTION XIV. 
WINE. 1 

384. The preamble to the German Act concerning the 
traffic in articles of food, &c., May 14, 1879, declares uncon- 
ditionally that the name wine can be given only to a beverage 
prepared by alcoholic fermentation from the juice of grapes 
without any addition. In reality alien additions are often 
made to wine or to the must before fermentation (water, 
sugar, alcohol, colouring and aromatic substances). 

Pure grape-juice contains especially: grape-sugar, levu- 
lose, sometimes jointly amounting to from 10 to 30 per cent. ; 
malic acid, tartaric acid (or, in its stead, in the Southern 
wines, its isomer para -tartaric acid), together from 0*4 to 
2'0 per cent. ; gum, mannite, albumenoid substances, tannin ; 
phosphoric acid and sulphuric acids combined with calcium 
and potassium ; little sodium chloride. 

The fermentation is effected by yeasts which adhere to the skins of 
the grapes, and are introduced into the must on pressing. If it is 
desired to produce white wine, the must is quickly pressed away from 
the skin and stalks ; for red wine the skins of purple grapes are allowed 
to ferment along with the must, yielding thus a wine rich in tannin 
(from the stalks and in seeds) and in colouring-matter, which is ex- 
tracted from the skins by the alcohol and the acid. 

During fermentation there are formed from the sugars 
ethylic alcohol and small quantities of higher alcohols (see 
Spirits), carbonic acid (which escapes), a little glycerine and 
snccinic acid. There always appear traces of esters (e.g., 



1 On sweet wines see appendix to Wine. 

220 



WINE. 221 

ethyl-esters of cenanthylic and caprylic acid), which impart 
to the wine its aroma (bouquet). 

The hope of obtaining wines of peculiarly good properties 
by adding to the freshly pressed grape-juice pure cultures of 
suitable yeasts in considerable quantity has hitherto been 
fulfilled only to a very limited extent. See Mliller-Thurgau 
(VierteljaKrschrift uber den Fortschritt der Ckemie der Nali- 
rungs- und Genussmittd, 1890, p. 464). The sugar is generally 
fermented away except in traces. If the proportion of sugar 
is in very considerable quantities, the alcohol which is formed 
checks complete fermentation, and there remains especially 
levulose, which ferments more slowly (select wines 1 ). The 
tartar is insoluble in the alcoholic liquid ; there separates out 
a mixture of acid potassium tartrate COOH CHOH - 
CHOH COOK, and neutral calcium tartrate C 4 H 4 6 Ca on 
the sides of the cask. The yeast also deposits at the bottom, 
and the wine after some time may be drawn into new 
casks. 

The composition of light wines varies greatly, according 
to locality and season (Table X. gives some mean numbers 
according to Konig). 

For a general survey the following results by Dietzsch 
may be communicated. In 100 cc, there are:

A. Examination of Wine. 

385. Since a Commission which came together in 1884 
in the Imperial Office of Health has agreed upon unitary 
methods for the analysis of wines, they must be taken as a 
basis for all examinations of wine, as by this means alone 
can comparable results be obtained. In the following pas- 
sages only the methods of hygienic importance will be 
verbally quoted : for other matter we refer to the excellent 
brief commentary on these resolutions which has been pub- 
lished by Max Earth, the Principal of the liuf'ach experi- 
mental station for the cultivation of wine (Die Wciuanalyse, 
Hamburg and Leipzig. Yoss, 1884), of which I have made 
frequent use below. 

In like manner the short but clear Anleitung zur Ckem. 
Analyse dcs Wcines of Borgmann will prove of the best 
service. 

We regularly determine : 

(Quantitatively. 



Specific gravity. 
Extract. 
Alcohol. 
Glycerine. 



Total free acid. 
Sulphuric acid. 
Ash. 
Polarisation. 



Sugar. 
Gum. 



SAMPLING AND EXAMINATION. 223 

Qualitatively. 

Alien colouring- 
matters. 



Under some circumstances there may be required a quantitative 
examination for : 



Sugar. 

Volatile acid. 
Tartar and free 

tartaric acid. 
Succinic acid, malic 

acid, citric acid. 



Salicylic acid (quali- 
tative only). 

Sulphurous acid. 

Tannin. 

Mineral constituents 
separately. 

Nitrogen. 



All quantitative statements in wine are given as grammes 
in 100 cc. 

It would be more consistent to state the constituents as percentages 
by weight ; but these may be found by calculation if the specific, 
gravity is known, which lies outside the limits O99 to 1*01 only in 
strongly sacchariferous or imperfectly fermented wines, and is generally 
very close upon 1. 



i. Sampling and Examination with the Senses. 

386. The obtaining samples for chemical examination is 
often preceded by a trial by specially trained, sworn tasters. 
But in the inspection of cellars the chemist may personally 
try the wines, and cause the samples to be taken in well- 
cleansed bottles, if bottled wines are not in question. If 
possible, two bottles of each suspected sort should be taken, 
so that the determinations may all be carried out in duplicate, 
which is especially needful in case of wines. Until analysis 
the sealed and labelled bottles must be kept in a locked cellar. 

Musts or new wines show, "at the time when the vine 
blossoms " (i.e., when the cellars become warmer), a disen- 
gagement of carbonic acid an after-fermentation, which is 
the stronger the richer the new wine is in sugar and the 
poorer in alcohol. Ked wines deposit in the casks, as well 
as in bottles, a coloured sediment at the bottom, which often 
appears suspicious to the ignorant, and consists, besides 
tartar, of earthy salts, colouring and tanning principles, &c. 



224 WINE. 

Such suspicious deposits have to be examined chemically and 
bacteriologically ; sometimes, in case of bottles with everted 
bottoms, it may happen that grains of shot (lead with traces 
of arsenic) have got wedged between the glass sides l during 
cleansing. Many wines take a darker colour if allowed to 
stand open to the air. See 403, footnote. The observer 
should beware of giving an opinion founded merely on the 
smell and taste. 

2. Specific Gravity. 

387. The determination is performed as for beer, with the 
Westphal balance or the pycnometer at 15, and must never 
be omitted. 

3. Alcohol. 

388. We proceed exactly as for beer, distilling ( 3) from 
100 cc. of wine only 60 to 70 cc. into a pycnometer holding 
100 cc. The distillate is filled up to the mark 100; the 
contents are mixed by means of a rotary movement, placed 
in water at 15*5 ; finally made up exactly to 100, proceeding 
further as for beer. The proportion of alcohol is found from 
the specific gravity according to the Table XV". (Hehner's 
table). 

Besides el hylic alcohol, the principles of the bouquet which may he 
present, volatile acids (salicylic acid if it has been added, and, in case 
of sour wines, acetic acid) pass into the distillate ; but these trifling 
quantities exert no perceptible influence upon the specific gravity of 
the distillate, except in the case of wines which are totally spoiled. 
In this case it must be neutralised before distillation. The residue 
from the distillate can be used for the determination of sulphuric acid. 

4. Extract. 

389. For determining the extract, 50 cc. of wine are 
measured out at 15 C., evaporated down on the water-bath 
in platinum capsules (of 85 mm. diameter, 20 mm. depth, 



1 Shot should be entirely discarded for cleansing bottles. Small fragments 
of quartz are preferable. Editor. 



GLYCEKINE. 225 

and 75 cc. contents ; weight about 20 grm.*). The residue is 
then heated for 2J hours in the water-drying niche. Of 
sacchariferous wines, i.e., wines containing more than 0*5 
grm. sugar in 100 cc., a smaller quantity must be taken after 
suitable dilution, so that TO or at most 1/5 grin, extract 
may have to be weighed. By extract residue we understand 
residue free acid. (In beer extract, residue = extract ; 
see 366). 

The water-drying niche is a drying-box of metal with double sides, 
the intervals being filled with water. 

It is very important that these directions should be accurately 
followed as regards the size of the capsules, the length of time, &c, 
They are supplied by all manufacturers of platinum articles at about 
1, 10s, according to the price of the metal. 

Indirect Method. The indirect determination of the extract of wine 
by ascertaining the specific gravity of the de-alcoholised liquid (as for 
beer, 370, 5), and reading off the extract in Schulze-Ostermann's table 
(Table XIII.), gives for ordinary wines results which are more or less 
discordant. Still more inaccurate is the table drawn up by Hager for 
the same purpose. These tables are founded on pure extracts of malt. 
Hager, moreover, had dried the extract of malt which he used for this 
purpose at 110, and on this account they were suitable only for the 
determination of extracts in similar sugary liquids, e.g., for sweet wines 
in which the direct determination gives unequal results according to 
the quantity of wine used. The extract of ordinary wines, however, 
consists merely of traces of sugar with glycerine, acids, and mineral 
constituents, the specific gravity of which differs considerably from that 
of sugar. Hence in such wines the extract must always be determined 
by the direct process exactly as directed, whilst in sweet wines the 
indirect method is preferable (Haas, Mittheil. der Jc. Jc. Chem. Pliys. Ver- 
suchsstation Klosterneuburg, part 5, 68). 



5. Glycerine. 

390. 100 cc. of wine (for sweet wines see below) are evaporated 
down to about 10 cc. in a capacious but not shallow capsule on the 
water-bath ; a little quartz-sand and milk of lime l are added until the 
reaction is strongly alkaline, and the whole is evaporated almost to 
dryness. The residue, whilst being constantly triturated, is treated 



1 Earth (Pharm. Centralhalle, 1884, p. 482) states the method more pre- 
cisely ; he uses 2 grm. quartz-sand, and from 3 to 4 cc. of milk of lime, which 
has been well shaken up, and which has been obtained by making up 151 
calcium oxide with water to 500 cc. 

VOL. II. P 



226 WINE. 

with 50 cc. alcohol at 96 per cent, by volume, boiled on the water-bath 
whilst stirring, the solution is passed through a filter, and the insoluble 
matter is exhausted with small quantities of the same alcohol at the 
same temperature, which generally requires from 50 to 150 cc., so that 
the total nitrate makes up from 100 to 200 cc. The alcoholic extract is 
evaporated on the water-bath to a syrupy consistence. The evaporation 
of the main quantity of the alcohol is not excluded. The residue is taken 
up with 10 cc. of absolute alcohol mixed with 15 cc. of ether in a vessel 
which can be stoppered, allowed to stand until it is clear, and the clear 
liquid is decanted off and filtered if needful 1 into a light weighing-glass 
capable of being closed with a glass stopper. Here it is cautiously 
evaporated until the residue no longer flows, and then dried for one 
hour in the water-drying niche. When cold it is weighed. In case of 
sweet wines 2 (more than 5 grm. of sugar in 100 cc. of wine), we add to 
50 cc. in a spacious flask a little sand, and a sufficiency of slacked lime 
reduced to powder are heated, and the flask is heated on the water-bath 
with occasional shaking. When cold 100 cc of alcohol at 96 per cent, 
by volume are added, the precipitate formed is allowed to settle, filtered 
off from the liquid, and washed with alcohol of the same strength. The 
alcohol of the filtrate is evaporated away, and the residue is treated as 
above directed. 

Caution is necessary in boiling out the calcareous dry residue with 
alcohol ; the mass covered with alcohol must be well and continuously 
triturated witli the pestle, otherwise it is apt to spirt. A large water- 
bath and a small flame must also be used lest the alcohol should 
become ignited. 

If a determination of glycerine has to be undertaken (see decision, 
$ 401, 5), in order to detect an addition of glycerine or alcohol to wine, 
this procedure must be exactly followed, otherwise we obtain quite 
different results from which false conclusions might be drawn. The 
determination of glycerine is at once a weak and an important point in 
the analysis of wine. What we ultimately weigh as glycerine differs 
very greatly in colour and odour from genuine glycerine ; it is very 
impure glycerine. 

In forming a decision all the relations of the constituents of wine, 
as observed, have to be referred to the glycerine so obtained, and in 
default of anything better we have to take this so-called glycerine into 
account. On the one hand it contains nitrogenous substances (possibly 
also mannite), and on the other hand genuine glycerine is volatilised 
dining evaporation and drying. But if we always work in a perfectly 
uniform manner we obtain quite uniform results, which alone can be 
here decisive. 



1 The sediment can be rinsed with a mixture of one part absolute alcohol 
and 1 .^ part ether. 

- For sweet wines the process is especially untrustworthy. 



VOLATILE AND FIXED ACIDS. 227 

6. Free Acid. (Totality of the Constituents of Wine 
having an Acid Reaction.) 

391. Just as in beer the acidity is always calculated as 
"free lactic acid," so in wine it is always reckoned as free 
tartaric acid. In reality it is affected by the presence of 
acid salts, especially tartar, acid potassium tartrate, and also 
by phosphates, malic acid, &c. 

25 cc. of wine are drawn off with a pipette into a beaker, 
shaken to expel carbonic acid, and titrated with decinormal 
(or one-fifth normal) soda-lye. Whoever has the necessary 
experience can, even without an indicator, recognise the final 
point approximately by the fact that a newly added drop of 
the lye produces no change of colour at the spot where it falls 
into the liquid, since the colouring-matter, especially of white 
wines, acts as a natural indicator. The titration is, however, 
always repeated a second time, adding 0*5 cc. less lye than 
in the first experiment, titrating drop by drop, and (as in 
beer) after every agitation placing a drop with the end of 
the stirring-rod upon very sensitive litmus paper until it is 
no longer reddened. 

If we titrate 25 cc. of wine with one-fifth normal lye, a simple multipli- 
cation of the cubic centimetres consumed by 0"06 gives the quantity of 
free tartaric acid sought for. If, e.g., the quantity of wine used was 9 '4 cc., 
then 9"4 x O06 = 0-564 grm. free tartaric acid contained in 100 cc. 

of wine (1 cc. of normal lye = 0'075 tartaric acid ; therefore 4 x - x 

o 

9-4 = 0-564). 

7. Volatile and Fixed Acids. 

392. The volatile acids are determined as in beer, and calculated as 
acetic acid. We pour (Fig. 84, 212) 50 cc. of wine into the flask b, 
and about 250 cc. of water into a, and distil until there are about 200 cc. 
in the receiver, the wine being concentrated only to about 15 cc., and 
must by no means be burned. The titration must be effected with 

one-fifth normal soda-lye, if, e.g., 3 -5 cc. have been used. 

0-042 grm. = 0*084 per cent, acetic acid is present. The determination 
is generally effected only in such wines as attract attention by a decided 
acidity. 

If it is desired to ascertain the non- volatile acids (expressed as tartaric 



228 WINE. 

acid), the number of cubic centimetres of one-fifth normal lye found for 
volatile acids are subtracted from the number found by the direct 
titration of an equal quantity of wine, and the difference is multiplied by 



, lX 0015. 

o 

O.K 

Example. 50 cc. of wine on direct titration consume _ - - x 0*015 = 

lO'o 

0'230 ; therefore the proportion of fixed acid calculated as tartaric 
acid = 0-460 per cent. 



8. The Several Organic Acids and the Tartar. 

393. The examination of wine for free tartaric, the 
quantitative determination of free tartaric acid if present, 
and of the tartar, as well as the determination of citric and 
succinic acid, are of too little hygienic importance to be here 
described. 

9. Tannin. 

394. All determinations of tannin determine also the 
colouring-matter of wine ; such analyses are performed on 
red wines only. 

For an accurate determination the detailed process of 
Lowenthal-Neubauer-Sckrceder must be recommended, in 
which the wine is mixed with solution of indigo, and titrated 
with potassium permanganate in presence of sulphuric acid

For approximate determinations Earth, in connection with the recom- 
mendation of the Commission, and improving upon it, proposes the 
following method : 

He mixes 12 cc. of wine with 30 cc. alcohol, shakes it up, allows it to 
deposit, filters off 35 cc. (corresponding to 10 cc. of the original wine), 
evaporates it down to about 6 cc., and makes it up with water to 10 cc. If 
necessary, the free acid is neutralised down to 0'5 yrm. in 100 cc. 1 cc. 
of a 40 per cent, solution of sodium acetate is added, and lastly, avoiding 
excess, a 10 per cent, solution of ferric chloride. There is now formed 
a precipitate, from the volume of which, after standing for twenty-four

hours, the proportion of tannic is found. In order to read off the 
volume accurately, the determination is effected in test-glasses 18 mm. 
in width in their upper part, but contracted in their lower part to a 
width of 8 mm. and graduated. The quantities of precipitate signify 
the following percentages of tannin :

It has been further proposed (Girard) to soften about 5 grm. of catgut 
(violin strings before oiling) in water, to wash repeatedly, twist, dry, 
and after weighing to allow it to lie for a couple of days in 100 cc. of 
wine. After the membrane (which is thus tanned) has been washed 
and dried until the weight becomes constant, the tannin is found 
approximately by the increase of weight. 



10. Sugar. 

395. Sugar is to be determined after an addition of sodium car- 
bonate by Fehling's method (using separate solutions, according to 215), 
and in wines rich in sugar (i.e., containing more than 0'5 grm. sugar per 
100 cc.), with observance of the modifications indicated by Soxhlet and 
Allihn (see 219), and to be calculated as grape-sugar. Strongly 



230 WINE. 

coloured wines, if their proportion of sugar is low, are to be decolorised 
with purified animal charcoal ; but if the sugar exceeds 0'5 per cent, 
with basic lead acetate, and then to receive an addition of sodium 
carbonate (see 396). 

If polarising points to the presence of cane-sugar (for details see section 
on polarisation), the sugar must be again determined after the inversion 
of the solution. (Heating with hydrochloric acid in the manner indi- 
cated. Cane-sugar is calculated from the difference.) 

The decolorising agents remove colouring-matter and tannin, which 
are also reductive. As animal charcoal retains sugar from strong sugary 
solutions, its use is inadmissible for wines containing much sugar. 

For a general indication of the percentage of reductive 
sugars Earth recommends the following process : 

5 cc. of the alkalised wine are placed in a test-tube with 
3 cc. of Fehling's solution, and heated in a water-bath in full 
ebullition until the liquid floating above the precipitate is 
perfectly clear ; if it still shows a distinct blue tint 5 cc. more 
of wine are added. If after subsidence decoloration appears, 
the proportion of sugar lies between 0'2 and O'l per cent. 
If a blue colour still remains the wine contains less than O'l 
per cent, of sugar. If the proportion of sugar is more than 
0*2 and less than 0*5 per cent., the experiment is repeated 
with 5 cc. of Fehling's solution. But if the percentage of 
sugar is greater than O'O, it must be ascertained more ex- 
actly according to 219. Reischauer's star ( 220) may also 
be conveniently used for the determination of small quantities 
of sugar. 

ii. Polarisation. 

396. For examination in the polarising apparatus wine 
must be decolorised. To this end we proceed as follows : 

1. In white wines GO cc. are mixed in a measuring-cylinder with 3 cc. 
of basic lead acetate, and filtered. To 31 '5 cc. of the filtrate we add 1'5 cc. 
of a saturated solution of sodium carbonate, filter again, and polarise 
the filtrate. We thus obtain a dilution of 10 : 11, which must be kept 
in mind. 

2. In red wines GO cc. of wine are mixed with G cc. of basic lead 
acetate ; to 33 cc. of the filtrate there are added 3 cc. of the saturated 
solution of sodium carbonate ; the liquid is again filtered and polarised. 
The dilution here amounts to 5 : G. The above relations (in white and 
red wines) are selected, so that the last filtrate suffices to fill the tube 
220 mm. in length, the capacity of which is about 28 cc. 



POLARISATION. 231 

The filtrate from the basic lead acetate precipitate must be colourless ; 
if this is not effected by the quantities of basic lead acetate indicated, 
which may be the case with the deeply red wines of southern regions, 
the addition of lead acetate, and accordingly the subsequent addition of 
solution of sodium carbonate, must be increased in proportion. 

It is absolutely necessary to filter off the first lead precipitate before 
precipitating the excess of lead with sodium carbonate, as otherwise the 
soda would act also upon the lead-compound of the colouring-matter, 
so that we should finally obtain dirty yellowish brown or green liquids, 
which cannot be polarised. 

In place of basic lead acetate we may use for decolorisation the smallest 
possible quantities of purified animal charcoal. In this case an addition 
of soda is not required for polarisation, and the volume of the wine is 
not altered. 

The examination of polarisation is always undertaken in a 
tube 220 mm, in length. 

In pure wines there occur the following substances capable 
of acting upon the plane of polarisation of light : 

1. Small quantities of dextrose and levulose. Only in 
select wines and in southern wines there occur considerable 
quantities of unfermented sugars, among which levulose pre- 
dominates as being less easily fermented. 

2. Tartaric acid (dextro-rotatory), and some constituents 
not accurately known. 

Thoroughly fermented wines, which have been artificially 
sweetened when in the state of must, behave in the polarising 
apparatus like ordinary wines, if merely invert-sugar, cane- 
sugar, or pure crystalline grape-sugar 1 has been used. If 
the quantity of sugar added is very large, or the entire 
quantity is not thoroughly fermented, the same conditions 
occur as in select wines (levo-rotation), but of course there 
is dextro-rotation if non-inverted cane-sugar or (rare) un- 
fermented grape-sugar is used. But cane-sugar is usually 
inverted by the ferment ; invert-sugar is levo-rotatory. 

If impure glucose (starch-sugar, see 352) has been added, 
we find, along with dextrose which may have escaped fer- 
mentation, more or less of a substance allied to dextrine and 
strongly dextro-rotatory amyline (Bechamp) or gallisine 



1 As pure grape-sugar is very costly only cane- or invert-sugar is used by 
the more cautious sophisticates. 



232 WINE. 

(Schmitt, of Wiesbaden). The latter has isolated the sub- 
stance and studied it closely (Mitthcilungen aus der amtlich. 
Lebensmitteluntersuclmngsanstalt, Wiesbaden, Director Schmitt, 
1883-84). The substance (C 12 H 24 10 ) is, inter alia, insoluble 
in ether, almost insoluble in absolute alcohol, readily soluble 
in water and dilute alcohol. It reduces Fehling's solution, 
and, if heated for a long time to 105 in an aqueous solution 
with oxalic acid, it passes slowly into glucose. It is strongly 
dextro-rotatory, a i = ca. 80". There have been found in 
eleven commercial sorts of solid starch, sugar from 7 to 21 
per cent. 

Recently Scheibler and Mittelmeyer have proved that 
gallisine is identical with the isomaltose ; which has been 
carefully studied by E. Fischer (Chem. Zcitnnr/, 1891, p. 79). 

The interpretation of the results obtained by a determina- 
tion of the polarisation, which, according to the Berlin 
resolutions, are to be expressed in degrees Wild, 1 is to be 
effected (literally according to Borgmann) by the following 
consideration and further examination. 

I. The Wine shows no Deflection on Polarisation. 

This is (lie behaviour of most pure, perfectly fermented wines. 

But the non-polarisation maybe effected by the simultaneous presence 
of the non-fermentable substances of commercial potato-sugar, which 
arc dextro-rotatory, and by levo-rotatory sugar ; or by the presence of 
dextro-rotatory cane-sugar and levo-rotatory invert-sugar, so that in 
both cases the right- and left-deflection annul each other. 

a. We add in a ilask to 50 c>:. of wine 5 ft 1 , of dilute hydrochloric acid 
of specific gravity I'l, heat for ten minutes in the water-bath, and 
polari.se after decolorising with basic lead acetate. 

In presence of uni'ermented cane-sugar the wine is now levo-rotatory, 
as, on heating with acid, cane-sugar is converted into levo-rotatory 
invert-sugar. 

I. We mix 50 cc. of the de-alcoholised wine, made up with water to 
its original volume, in a small Ilask with yeast, well washed, and heat 
it to 30 in the water-bath until the fermentation is at an end, which 
is recognised by the cessation of the evolution of carbonic acid. The 
fermentation varies in its duration according to the quantity of sugar 



1 1 Wild = 4-6043 Soleil ; 1 Soleil = 0'2172 Wild ; 1 Wild = 2'8900 3 
Ventzke-Soleil ; 1 Ventzke-Soleil = 0'3460' J Wild. The degrees of Schmidt 
and Hansch are equal to those of Ventzke-Soleil. 



POLARISATION. 233 

contained in the wine, but it is completed in two or three days, even 
in wines which are rich in sugar. In wines which show no rotation, 
there either occurs no fermentation, or it ceases after one day. We 
then decolorise with basic lead acetate and polarise. 1 

If the wine is now dextro-rotatory, the simultaneous presence of 
levo-rotatory sugar and the non-fermentable substances of commercial 
potato-sugar is demonstrated. 

If no modification of the rotation is observed in a and 6, the absence 
of unfermented cane-sugar, of the non-fermentable substances of potato- 
sugar, and of levo-rotatory sugar is certainly established. 



II. The Wine is Deflected to the Right on Direct 
Polarisation. 

This dextro-rotation may be due to the presence of unfermented 
cane-sugar, to the non-fermentable substances of potato-sugar, or to 
both jointly. 

We invert the wine according to I. a . 

a. The wine after inversion rotates to the left ; it contains therefore 
unfermented cane-sugar. 

b. The wine rotates to the right more than + 0'8 Wild. The pre- 
sence of the non-fermentable substances of commercial potato-sugar is 
demonstrated. 

c. The wine rotates less than + 0'8 Wild and more than + 0'3 
Wild. (Pure wines may show a rotation up to + 3 Wild.) 

In the last case (c) we proceed as follows for the elimination of any 
dextro-rotatory tartaric acid : 

210 cc. of the wine are evaporated to a thin syrup in a porcelain 
capsule on the water-bath, with the addition of a few drops of a 20 per 
cent, solution of potassium acetate To the residue we gradually add 
with continual stirring 200 cc. of alcohol at 90 per cent, by volume. 
The alcoholic solution, when perfectly clear, is decanted off into a flask 
or filtered, and the alcohol is distilled or evaporated away down to 
about 5 cc. 

The residue is mixed with about 15 cc. of water and a little animal- 
charcoal which has been elutriated in water, filtered into a small 
graduated cylinder, and washed with water until the filtrate makes up 
30 cc. 

If on polarisation it shows a deflection of more than + 0'5 Wild, 
the wine contains the non-fermentable substances of commercial 
potato-sugar (amyline). 



1 If the wine contains no reductive sugar (or less than 0'3 per cent.), the 
fermentation experiment may be omitted. 



234 WINE. 



III. The Wine Rotates to the Left on Direct Polarisation. 

The wine then contains unfermented levo-rotatory sugar, which may 
be derived either from sugar originally present in the must, or may 
have been formed by inversion from cane-sugar added to the must. 
But it may at the same time contain the non-fermentable principles 
of potato-sugar and unfermented and not inverted cane-sugar. 

AVe now know that even the dextrinoid substances can be perfectly 
fermented by the repeated addition of fresh, particularly powerful sorts 
of yeast (press-yeast). See Borgmann, Fresenius, Immerheiser ; but 
we have not confirmed the observations (List) that such substances 
occur even in pure wines. 

12. Gum. 

397. In order to ascertain an addition of gum we mix 4 cc. of wine 
with 10 cc. of alcohol at 90 volumes per cent. If gum is present there 
appears a milky turbidity, which does not become completely clear 
even after many hours. The precipitate formed adheres in part to the 
bottom and the side of the glass turned away from the light, and forms 
little solid lumps. In genuine wine there are formed nocks, which 
soon deposit, and remain rather loose. For a closer examination it is 
well to evaporate the wine to the consistence of a syrup, to extract it 
with alcohol of the above strength, and dissolve the residue in water. 
The solution is mixed with a little hydrochloric acid (specific gravity, 
I'lO), heated for two hours under pressure, and the reduction value is 
then determined with Fehlmg's solution, and calculated as dextrose. 
In genuine wines no appreciable reduction is obtained in this manner. 
Dextrines mi-ht be ascertained in the same manner. 



13. Ash and its Several Constituents. 

398. The extract of 50 cc. of wine after weighing is 
incinerated at a gentle heat exactly according to 210. If 
the ash burns white slowly and with difficulty it is abnor- 
mally rich in chlorine. Chlorine may be determined in the 
ash after a cautions previous neutralisation with nitric acid 
free from chlorine, as in water ( 175), or gravimetrically, as 
silver chloride. For a direct titration of sodium chloride in 
wine, see Chemiker Zeituny Rcpert., 1891, p. 194. 

Sulphuric acid is directly determined in wine as in water 
( 176); a quantitative examination is effected only if a 
qualitative test has given cause to suspect the presence of 
abnormal quantitative quantities. 



ASH AND ITS SEVERAL CONSTITUENTS. 235 

For a preliminary estimate of the quantity of sulphuric 
acid present Barth proceeds as follows : 

He prepares a solution of barium chloride of known strength by dis- 
solving 14 grm. pure, dry, crystalline barium chloride with the addition 
of 50 cc. hydrochloric acid. If we use 10 cc. of wine for the test, 1 cc. 
of barium chloride consumed represents 1 grm. potassium sulphate per 
litre of wine. Every 10 cc. of wine are therefore mixed with 0'7, 1, 1'5, 
2 cc., and, if necessary, more solution of barium chloride. The liquid 
is boiled, allowed to settle, filtered, and the clear nitrate is tested with 
solution of barium chloride. The proportion of sulphuric acid is greater 
than corresponds to the barium chloride which has been added if a 
turbidity or a precipitate is produced in the filtrate on adding more 
barium chloride. It is smaller if the filtrate remains clear. 

In wines with an ash which has not a distinct alkaline reaction, 
phosphoric acid is determined by evaporating the wine down with 
sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate, igniting the residue slightly, 
and taking it up in dilute nitric acid, applying then the molybdenum 
method. If the ash is distinctly alkaline its nitric solution may be at 
once used for determining the phosphoric acid. 

If there is any suspicion both the ash (metals) and the 
wine may be directly tested (arsenic). 

Poisonous metals may be introduced into wine by the most 
diverse causes, e.g., accidental use of arsenic instead of 
gypsum, cleaning casks with arsenical sulphuric acid, pre- 
servation in or treatment with zinciferous or plumbiferous 
vessels or utensils, cleansing bottles with leaden shot, and 
formerly often by sweetening wines with sugar of lead. 
Copper is introduced into wine by sprinkling vineyards with 
preparations of copper (against the phylloxera), but only in 
traces which are hygienically indifferent, about from O'l to 
0*9 mgrm. per litre. 

Barium may be introduced by the dangerous attempt to 
remove sulphates from wine (derived from "plastering") by 
means of barium chloride, if an excess has been used.

15. Colouring- Matters. 1 

399. Eed wines are frequently more valuable than white 
wines from the same situation, whilst pale red wines are less 
valuable than those of a more intense colour. It has there- 
fore been for a long time often customary to colour such 
wines. The voluminous literature of the subject contains so 
much worthless matter that we must feel indebted to Haster- 
lick (of Hilger's laboratory), who has recently published a 
many-sided examination of the more recent methods (KrUische 
Studien iibcr die bislicrigcn Mcthoden zum Nacliweis frcmder 
Farlstoffc im Wcin. Dissert. Erlangen, 1889). The following 
information is mostly taken from his work, in which we also 
find many literary abstracts : 

1. Vegetable Colouring-Matters! 1 Bilberries, mallows, elder- 
berries, kernies-berries (Phytolacca). The three colouring- 
matters first mentioned approximate very closely to each 
other and to the colouring-matter of red wines. The pigment 
of Phytolacca alone can be accurately detected (even when 
mixed with red wine) by the reddish violet coloration of the 
precipitate produced with salts of lead, and which must be 
filtered off. 

The other vegetable colouring-matters give with this re- 
agent greyish blue, blueish green, or green precipitates which 
can be distinguished from each other at most if no pigment 
of red wine is present. Caustic lime even permits no certain 
diagnosis if coloured white wines are mixed with red wines. 

Latterly the fruit of the Chilian Tiliaceous plant, Aristotelia maqni, 
has been used for colouring wines, especially in France. The pigment 



1 White wines, especially the gold-coloured southern wines, are sometimes 
coloured with burnt sugar (caramel). This harmless colouring may be detected 
by an addition of fresh white of egg, which has been pressed through a piece 
of flannel and diluted with an equal volume of alcohol at 15 per cent. Normal 
white wines give a strong turbidity with this solution, and a much paler 
nitrate than the original wine, whilst coloured wines do not. 

- In Germany it has not been customary to search for vegetable colours, on 
account of the bad methods. I do not enter upon the detection of extracts of 
dye-woods, the weed-colours (orchil, &c.) betray themselves by the blue colour 
produced with alkalies. 



COLOUKING-MATTEKS. 237 

is nearly allied to that of wine. By the addition of 10 cc. of soda-lye 
at \ per cent, to 2 cc. of wine, we obtain a blueish green or greenish 
colour, which is permanent if heated, and fades but little, whilst if the 
maqui colouring-matter is present in quantity there appears a yellowish 
green colour, which quickly turns to a pure yellow on the application 
of heat. 

2. Coal-Tar Colouring- Matters. Numerous coal-tar colours 
have been used experimentally both pure and in mixtures for 
colouring wine, since a beginning was made with magenta in 
1878. Chemists were often unable to indicate with exact- 
ness the colouring-matter in question, even though they 
proved the presence of a coal-tar colour beyond all doubt. 
According to Hasterlick coal-tar colours are certainly present 
if the following reactions succeed : 

1. On shaking out the wine, slightly supersaturated with 
alkali, with ainylic alcohol the latter is coloured red. 

2. On shaking out the wine with ether the latter takes a 
distinct red colour. 

3. Magenta may be certainly detected by shaking out 100 
cc. wine with 5 cc. ammonia and 30 cc. of ether, when the 
ether remains colourless. If it is drawn off with a pipette 
and allowed to evaporate entirely in a watch-glass along with 
a thread of wool, the thread becomes rose-coloured even if 
mere traces of magenta are present. 

4. (According to Cazeneuve.) 10 cc. of wine are shaken 
in the cold for a minute with 0*2 grm. of mercury oxide, and 
after settling are filtered through a three or fourfold moist 
filter. A second portion is treated in the same manner, but 
it is boiled for a moment after shaking, but before filtration. 
The filtrate must be clear ; a turbid filtrate proves merely 
that the shaking, ebullition, and settling have not been con- 
tinued long enough. If the filtrate is not colourless tar 
colours are present. 

Erythrosine, eosine, methylene blue, and some other blue colours 
escape this method as they are precipitated. A series of other colouring- 
matters are partially precipitated, e.g., safranine, chrysoidine, chrysoine, 
methyleosine, yellow II, red NN, red I, ponceau ER. 

This method has repeatedly .been found not perfect. 



238 WINE. 

Eecently Ferreira da Silva (Cliem. Zeit. Rep., 1891, 229) 
alleges that he has not been able to decolorise 10 cc. of a pure 
Portuguese wine with less than 5'0 grm. of yellow mercuric 
oxide. 

5. (According to Carpenne, improved by me.) Smear- 
preparations of press-yeast or other yeast are made upon 
covering-glasses and allowed to dry. They are then floated for 
four hours in a watch-glass filled with the wine in question. 

E. Heitzmann found in my laboratory, with a little experience a 
very large number of colouring-matters may be recognised by a distinct 
red coloration of the cells, whilst ten different genuine red wines gave 
merely a faint brownish colour. Heitzmann was able to distinguish 
3 to 5 mgrm. of different colouring-matters in 1 litre of red wine, in 
five sets of experiments almost without an error. I had given him for 
examination each time twelve to fifteen samples of red wine, coloured 
and uncoloured, about which lie knew nothing. Bolder additions of 
from 5 to 10 mgrm. per litre yielded very striking results. 

No certain result can be obtained by shaking out non-alkalised wine 
with amylic alcohol, since acid, especially new wine, gives a slight red 
colour to amylic alcohol. Heitzmann finds 0*5 mgrm. magenta, 2*5 
mgrm. of acid magenta, and from 2 to 3 mgrm. of many other tar- 
colours per litre of wine suffice to render the colour of amylic alcohol 
much more intense and fiery than it is ever produced by wine alone. 

If the amylic alcohol extract or the shaking out of the 
coloured amylic alcohol with distilled water gives an absorp- 
tion spectrum with one or two distinct bands between C and E, 
but especially between D and E, a tar-colour is present ( 14). 

The spectroscopic detection of magenta and acid magenta for such 
extracts is exceedingly sensitive ; the pigments of wine and other vege- 
table colours are little adapted for spectroscopic detection. It is also 
impracticable to examine directly with the spectroscope red wines 
which have been coloured withtar-colours. 



B. The most frequent Processes for the 
Artificial Improvement and Increase of 
Wine. 

400. A. Procedures in which the volume is not (appre- 
ciably) increased. 

1. Addition of alcohol to the wine after fermentation 
renders it stronger and more permanent (Vinage). 



IMPEOVEMENT AND INCREASE OF WINE. 239 

2. Addition of esters (essences, oils of wine, bouquets) 

renders it more highly flavoured and fragrant. 

3. An addition of glycerine makes it sweeter, fuller in the 

mouth (known as Scheelising) ; said to be much used 
in North Germany. 

4. An addition of gypsum (plaster) to the pressed grapes. 

Plastering is used chiefly (or exclusively) with red 
grapes. The colour of the wine is rendered more 
fiery ; the wines become clear more rapidly, and are 
earlier fit for carriage, in consequence of the promo- 
tion of the fermentation. 

The following transposition occurs : 

CaS0 4 + C 4 H 5 K0 6 = S0 4 HK + C 4 H 4 CaO<5 

Potassium Acid potassium Calcium 

bitartrate. sulphate. tartrate. 

According to Kayser (Repert. d. Anal. Chemie, 1882, p. 65), the trans- 
position goes further : 

S0 4 HK + P0 4 H,K = S0 4 K 2 + P0 4 H 3 

Acid potassium Acid potassium Neutral potas- Phosphoric 
sulphate. phosphate. sium sulphate. acid. 

This latter reaction is still undecided, and is doubted by many. See 
Roos and Thomas (Comptes Rendus, 1890, vol. cxi., p. 575). 

5. An addition of marble dust to the must, in order to 

take up the free acid (Chaptalising), sometimes along 
with an addition of sugar (see No. 9 below). If the 
marble is added cautiously, calcium tartrate separates 
out instead of tartar. If marble is added more freely, 
there are readily formed from the free malic acid 
soluble calcium malates of an unpleasant taste. 

6. Addition of red colouring-matters, vegetable or derived 

from coal-tar ( 399). 

7. Addition of preservative agents : in addition to fumi- 

gating the casks with sulphur (hitherto indispensable), 
there are added sulphites, salicylic acid, &c. 

B. Methods which increase the volume. 

8. The addition of alcohol and water (sometimes with 

glycerine) to the fermented wine (Mouillage). 



240 WINE. 

9. Gall's process. Must which is too acid is diluted with 
water until its acidity becomes normal (about J per 
cent.), and then cane- or grape-sugar is added until it 
contains from 20 to 30 per cent, of sugar (Gallising). 
10. Petiot's process. The grapes which have once been 
pressed are pressed again or several times along with 
a solution of sugar. The second wine (Piquette) is 
used either alone or mixed with genuine wine 
(Petiotising). 

Pezeyre recommends that the grapes which yield TOO litres 
natural wine should be once more pressed along with 100 litres 
of warm water +17 kilos, sugar + 300 yrm. tartaric acid. The 
wine is said not to be distinguishable by taste from the wine 
of the first pressing (premier j?ts), and a third pressing still 
yields a tolerable small wine. Others obtain even larger quan- 
tities of wine. Piquettes are in general rich in bouquet- 
substances, and often contain some unfermented sugar. 

11. Yeast wines are obtained by causing sugar-water to 
ferment with wine-yeast, with an addition of tartaric 
acid. 

Latterly much wine has been obtained by fermenting 
water and raisins, with the occasional addition of suitable 
ingredients. A manufacture of wine from, water, sugar, 
tartaric acid, and alcohol, i.e., from purely artificial ingre- 
dients, is said to be practised. 

C. Decision on Wine. 

401. The question is often put to the food-chemist 
whether a wine just examined is a pure natural wine, and 
often whether it agrees with the statements on the label as 
to oriain and acre, or what additions it may have undergone. 

O O i/O 

The hygienist can and should decide only : 

1. Whether a wine in question is free from injurious sub- 
stances, i.e., whether any other disturbances of health are 
to be dreaded than those which, according to experience, 
resujt from the consumption of similar quantities of pure 
wine. 

2. Whether the wine is fit for a means of enjoyment. 



DECISION ON WINE. 241 

The requirements in this respect must naturally vary accord- 
ing to the purpose which the wine is intended to subserve. 
In any case no objectionable property must be present, and 
no disgusting addition must have taken place. 1 

Thus the point of view which hygiene can logically take 
is, in my opinion, clearly indicated. 

In frequent contradiction to existing legislation, to the 
efforts of so many associations, and to the wishes of numerous 
consumers and producers of wines, hygiene cannot condemn 
a wine which meets hygienic demands, even though the 
analysis or the confession of the producer renders artificial 
additions indubitable. It must, on the contrary, under some 
circumstances, warn the public against a pure wine of ba.d 
quality as unwholesome. There is sometimes, therefore, for 
the hygienist a real improvement of wine which he can only 
praise and recommend. 

For instance, K. Kayser (Vereinbarungen der Bayr. Chem., p. 174) 
obtained experimentally, from a must containing 10 per cent, of sugar 
and 1*2 per cent, of acid (calculated as tartaric acid), a wine A. When 
he mixed a portion of the must with the liquid, which he obtained by 
digesting the lees with warm water, and again pressing them, with the 
addition of cane sugar, there was obtained, after fermentation, tlie wine B. 
No one can doubt that, in spite of the considerable increase of volume, 
a more wholesome and cheaper product was obtained, whilst A was on 
the very limit of potability, and in any case would keep very badly.

I do not, therefore, need to examine how various corpo- 
rations, commissions, and law-courts have pronounced on the 
concrete question, what kind of improvements of wine are 
to be allowed or forbidden. These decisions are often dis- 
crepant, and are always chiefly dictated by principles of

national economy and social politics, even though they may 
be hygienically permitted. In this respect the opinions of 
the Health Office make a beneficent exception. Just as little 
have I here to diagnose from each other the concepts of 
natural wine and artificial wine, of wines properly and im- 
properly gallised, &c., though hygiene would gladly welcome 
the creation of legal definitions. 1 

It must l)e remarked that the wine-chemist, even if lie lias much 
experience, and is in possession of numerous confirmatory analyses of 
pure wines from the same district, has often great difficulty in solving 
the questions laid before him, and indeed sometimes cannot do it with 
certainty. " Coupage," the artful mixture of wines in order to produce 
sorts which the public like to buy, lias been highly developed, and 
renders the task of the chemist difficult. Even the detection of addi- 
tions to wine is not always practicable when the wine-sophisticators go 
to work cautiously, and use pure ingredients. It is even said to occur 
not rarely that cautious sophisticates sometimes ascertain, by sending 
a sample to the establishment for investigation, whether modern science 
can detect any fault in the artfully concocted preparation which, they 
allege, " has been offered them for sale." Such faults may mostly 
be corrected if the deceivers possess an accurate analysis ! For an 
interesting case of conflicting decisions on one and the same wine 
see the PharmaL Jahresbericht, 1883-84, p. 1025, where two opinions 
by Kayser and Xessler, based upon an accordant analysis, are con- 
trasted. 

In the sequel rules for a, decision on the purity of wine 
are given only in so far as it seems necessary in the interest 
of the completeness of the hygienic considerations, and for 
explaining to the physician the results of the chemist ; 
everything here mentioned is taken from the report of the 
" Commission." 



1 So much only may be mentioned. In the "considerations" which the 
"Commission'' appends to its; methods it utters annihilating words on the 
comprehension of the wine question which prevails in our courts. "If there 
takes place an addition of the above solution of sugar (sweetened extract of 
lees 2 kilos, and water 2 kilos, each, to 1 kilo, of sugar) to the must in mode- 
rate quantity, it can in by far the most numerous cases not be chemically 
detected in the wine. If it is declared by authority that the sale of such 
improved drinks is an offence against the law on articles of food, honest 
persons will avoid improving wine. But they can then in most cases not 
compete with other producers and dealers. The danger is at hand that by 
interfering with the rightful improvement of sour musts, the wine-trade may 
be driven into the hands of dishonest people." 



DECISION ON WINE. 243 

But the answer is often not easy even when the questions 
of the hygienist are thus more narrowly limited. As the 
action of a number of the substances which come here into 
consideration has not been accurately examined, and as 
many additions, harmless in themselves, may be used in a 
state of greater or less impurity, a cautious decision is in 
general advisable. 

The German Bill on the sale of wine which has been 
much criticised, and has not yet become law took up en- 
tirely a hygienic point of view (Chem. Zeit., 1887, p. 367), 
and its first section which alone concerns us runs, avoiding 
any definition of wine, as follows : 

" No wine, beverages containing wine or resembling wine, 
to which, during or after their preparation, there have been 
added compounds of barium, metallic lead or lead compounds, 
glycerine, kermes-berries, compounds of magnesium, salicylic 
acid, impure spirit (containing free amylic alcohol), uncrys- 
tallised starch-sugar, tar-colours, or mixtures containing any 
of these substances, or which contain in 1 litre of liquid 
more sulphuric acid than occurs in 2 grm. neutral potassium 
sulphate, may be kept commercially for sale, or sold to 
others for the purposes of food or enjoyment. The same 
prohibition extends to the same class of beverages to which 
there have been added, during or after their preparation, 
soluble salts of aluminium (alum, &c.), or mixtures contain- 
ing such substances. Effervescing wines underlie this pro- 
hibition only when more than O'Ol grm. alum is contained in 
1 litre." 

We have now to consider the hygienic importance of the 
several constituents analytically ascertained. 

1. Alcohol. Too small a proportion of alcohol (below 4 
or 5 per cent.), whether natural or caused by dilution, causes 
the wines to appear of bad keeping properties. A wine with 
a proportion of alcohol below 4 per cent, does not meet the 
demands which we are accustomed to make on wine as an 
article of enjoyment. 

Against too high a percentage of alcohol it can at most be 
objected that such wines are too intoxicating ; but the best 



244 WINE. 

wines have exactly this property. 1 But hygiene is perfectly 
in accord with the proposal that sweetened and watered wines 
should not contain more than 9 per cent, of alcohol, as its 
object is to combat strongly alcoholic, cheap beverages. 

For the artificial increase of the percentage of alcohol the 
best refined spirit is generally used, 2 which has no other 
effect than that produced by the fermentation of grape-juice. 
The use of badly purified, fuseliferous spirit in the manu- 
facture of wine (not easily detected, even by the experienced 
chemist) must be judged toxicologically according to Section 
XV. 

2. On the "bouquet" substances (esters of various alco- 
hols, especially the higher) which occur in every wine, but 
are sometimes added in abnormally high doses by manufac- 
turers of wine, there is a work by Poincare and Valois 
(Pharm. Zcitung, 1886, No. 11), from which it appears that 
large doses of these compounds are hurtful, but small pro- 
portions, such as might be added to wine, unobjectionable. 3 

3. Sugar. In connection with alcohol the proportion of 
sugar may be here considered. Wines which have been 
thoroughly fermented contain usually from 0*01 to O'l, or at 
the utmost 0*25 per cent, of sugar. A higher percentage in 
a German wine, other than one made from selected grapes, 
signifies either incomplete fermentation or the addition of 
sugar to the wine after fermentation. In no case does the 
presence of sugar signify unwholesomeiiess. 

For the preparation of the finer wines the must is at 
present sweetened chiefly with invert-sugar, which is either 
purchased ready-made (almost free from acid), or is prepared 



1 This may be called in question. The "grand cms'' of Burgundy, Impe- 
rial Tokay, &c., are less intoxicating than the low, brandied sherries too 
commonly sold in England. Editor. 

- The Paris Academie de Medecin has formally pronounced the addition of 
alcohol to wine, according to modern custom, unwholesome. The Academy 
does not protest against the addition of sugar to must if only crystallised 
sugar is used (Wcinlaubc, 1886, p. 404). A hygienic basis for this view 
seems to me impossible. 

3 Unfortunately I can give no further information concerning this work, as 
T have been unable to obtain it either in the original or in a full abstract. 



DECISION ON WINE. 245 

by the wine-grower by inverting the finest cane-sugar with 
a little sulphuric acid. Against these products, which border 
very closely upon the constituents of grape-juice, absolutely 
no objection can be raised on the part of hygiene. As little 
can be urged against crystallised glucose, or against pure cane- 
sugar which is first inverted by yeast and then fermented. 

The conditions are less clear as regards starch-sugar, i.e., 
glucose manufactured from starch. 

The above-mentioned non-fermentable constituents of 
starch-sugar, amyline, or gallisine ( 396), were for a long time 
considered as very poisonous, 1 especially on account of some 
experiments by Schmitz and by Nessler. 

Schmitz (Dissertation, Bonn, 1878) has subcutaneously injected, especi- 
ally into animals, residues of the fermentation of potato-sugar, and with 
these preparations lie has obtained generally pain, but almost always 
at the same time lassitude, stupor, trembling, &c. An injection of the 
extract of gallised wine gave rise, in a young dog, to repeated vomiting. 
Only one feeding experiment was made with a purified preparation by 
Neubauer, and it took no effect. Two experiments made on men, on 
the different action of gallised and non-gallised wines, gave no con- 
cordant results. Nessler, in 1880, observed in two experiments on 
himself and on Earth, on the use of bitter and ill-flavoured residues of 
fermentation free from alcohol, headache, sweating, and on one occa- 
sion vomiting. (For details see Schmitt.) 

But recently (1884) Von Mehring (Deutsche Vierteljahr- 
schrift f. offentl. G-esundheitspflage, vol. xiv.), in eleven ex- 
periments on animals (including man), and Schmitt (of 
Wiesbaden), along with his medical colleague, A. Pfeiffer, 
observed no injury either from impure residues of fermen- 
tation and crude potato-sugar, or from carefully purified 
gallisine and strongly gallised wines. Schmitt even alleges 
that he has used as the material for his experiments the 
same potato-sugar which Nessler had employed in his re- 
searches. Von Mehring even does not hesitate to pronounce 
the non-fermentable substances, like dextrine, good nutri- 
ments. Eecently Scheibler and Mittelmeyer have even 



1 In the latest edition of Eisner's work, 1889, we read that the injurious 
action of the non-fermentable part of starch-sugar upon the organism of man 
and other animals, though formerly often denied, is now placed beyond all 
doubt. 



2 4 5 WINE. 

demonstrated that gallisine is identical with E. Fischer's 
isomaltose (Chem. Zeitung, 1891, p. 79). 

I must admit that these investigations have led me to the 
conviction that a variety of conditions must co-operate for 
the origin of poisonous substances in gallising, if, indeed, 
they do originate ; gallisine is in any case not responsible for 
the toxic action. But I cannot yet, like Schmitt, undertake 
the responsibility of pleading for potato-sugar. Hygiene has 
nothing to object to the use of pure sugar of well-known 
qualities (grape-sugar, cane-sugar, or invert-sugar), but it has 
no cause to advocate impure potato-sugar in opposition to 
these well-known substances, even though it may be cheaper 
by a few "pfennige," 1 and yields a mouth-filling preparation. 
Wine has not to serve as an article of food. 

The addition of saccharine is to be judged according to 354. 
According to trials made at the experimental station for the growth 
of wine and fruit at Klosterneuburg, 01)01 per cent, of saccharine per- 
ceptibly improved the flavour of wine, 0*002 per cent, distinctly, and 
and 0*003 per cent, very remarkably. A larger addition than the 
latter, -i.e., 3 f/rm. per hectolitre, is not to be recommended. Such 
small quantities are also pronounced harmless by the "Austrian 
Supreme Sanitary Council." 

4. Extract. From the proportion of extract no conclusion 
can be drawn as to uiiwholesomeness. But for the sake of 
completeness room may here be found for the indications of 
the above-mentioned Commission how inferences may be 
drawn from the extract. 

" Wines prepared exclusively from pure grape-juice rarely contain 
quantities of extract which fall below T5 ym\. in 100 cc. Hence wine 
poorer in extract is objectionable if it contains a smaller proportion, 
unless it can be shown that there occur natural wines of the same season, 
and from a similar position, with as low a proportion of extract." 

This last sentence often furnishes the defence with a much desired 
way of escape, since proof is advanced of the previous occurrence (under 
the most unfavourable conditions conceivable) of the production of a 
similarly wretched wine. 

" Without the deduction of the non-volatile acids, the residual extract 
in natural wines amounts, according to present experience, to at least 
1*1 ynn., and, after such deduction, to at least 1-0 yrm. in 100 cc. Wines 



One pfennig = yi^ part of <i shilling. 



DECISION ON WINE. 247 

showing smaller residual extracts are to be condemned, unless it can be 
shown, &c., as above. 

" A wine which contains mineral matter to the extent of decidedly 
more than 10 per cent, of the residual extract must accordingly contain 
more extract than was otherwise assumed as the minimum. In natural 
wines there very frequently occurs a proportion approaching one part 
by weight of mineral matter to ten parts by weight of extract. A well- 
marked deviation from this proportion does not, however, at once 
warrant the conclusion that the wine is falsified." 

5. The proportion of glycerine in pure wines fluctuates 
very considerably; according to 384, from 0'3 to 1-38 per 
cent. As, however, it is a bye-product of fermentation, it 
bears a certain proportion to the percentage of alcohol. 

"The proportion between alcohol and glycerine may fluctuate in 
natural wines between 100 parts by weight of alcohol to 7 parts by 
weight of glycerine, and 100 parts of alcohol to 14 of glycerine. In 
wines which show a different proportion, the addition of alcohol or of 
glycerine is to be inferred. As in the cellar manipulations, small 
quantities of alcohol (at most, 1 per cent, by volume) may find their 
way into the wine, this circumstance must be taken into considera- 
tion in forming a decision." 

If alcohol and glycerine have been added simultaneously, the detec- 
tion is almost impossible, as we have no means for a sufficiently accu- 
rate determination of the succinic acid which is formed simultaneously 
during fermentation. Even if we could do this the falsifiers would 
.add succinic acid just as they now artificially increase the proportion 
of phosphoric acid. 

An addition of glycerine, as it can be practically applied, 
should not be pronounced hurtful, for even if large quantities 
of undiluted glycerine, taken at once, act as a purgative, say 
from 15 to 30 grm., and if very large doses have an action 
resembling that of alcohol, there is no doubt that the addition 
of a few grammes of glycerine (about 5 grm. per litre) are 
perfectly harmless in such dilution. Experiments on the 
guinea-pig a very susceptible animal prove that J grm. 
daily per kilogramme can be mixed with the food without 
injury. But the idea of consuming added glycerine excites 
disgust in the majority of persons. This disgust is increased 
by the representation that much glycerine is obtained from 
the fat of beasts which have died of disease. 1 

1 This representation is, of course, not quite accurate. The number of such

6. Wines with a total acidity of 1*1 to 1'3 per cent, or 
upwards are unfit for drinking ; they taste unpleasantly, and 
very often occasion diarrhcea. They keep badly, as they 
contain only 5 to 6 per cent, of alcohol. Such wines are fit 
only for the manufacture of vinegar, or they might have been 
gallised when in the state of must. 

u The quantity of free tartaric acid in natural wines amounts to not 
more than one-sixth of the total non-volatile acids." 

Larger quantities of free tartaric acid may generally be traced to the 
use of unripe grapes, or the addition of tartaric acid to the diluted and 
fortified wine. 

Tartaric acid in general in the form of acid potassium tartrate or 
tartar, is never absent in wine, as are also malic and succinic acids, and 
to a slight extent citric acid. 

As regards the proportion of acetic acid, the Commission for the 
Statistics of Wine at Carlsruhe in 1890 resolved that white wine con- 
taining O'OSO per cent,, and red wine with 0'120 per cent, of acetic acid r 
are to be pronounced " inclining to sourness," whilst white wine with 
0'120 per cent,, and red wine with O'lGO per cent, of acetic acid, are 
spoiled, and no longer fit for consumption. 

7. A proportion of tannin not too low is desirable. On the 
one hand (according to Nessler), it renders the wine more 
capable of resisting schizomycetes ; secondly, the tannin is 
the essential factor for the medicinal dietetic action of red 
wines. In. red wines O25 per cent, is a high, and O'l per 
cent, a low proportion ; white wines usually contain only 
about 01 per cent. 

8. An addition of water 1 will not easily act injuriously 



beasts is small as compared with those slaughtered, and a very large and in- 
creasing proportion of the glycerine procurable is obtained from vegetable fats, 
especially palm-oil. Editor, 

1 Here it may be mentioned that, as in the case of milk, the presence of 
nitric acid assists in betraying the presence of water. 

If the percentage of nitric acid in the water used was low the simplest form 
of the test is sufficient. White wine is decolorised by shaking up with 
animal charcoal (free from nitric acid), and red wine with basic lead acetate 
and magnesium sulphate. The clear nitrates are allowed to flow into con- 
centrated sulphuric acid, in which about O'Ol yrm, diphenylamine per 100 cc. 
has been dissolved. 1 myrm. N-_>O,5 in 100 cc. of wine gives a distinct blue 
coloration. In utilising the results care is necessary, as the^casks, &c., have 
to be rinsed with water. If such water is very rich in nitric acid a demon- 
strable quantity of nitric acid may be introduced into the wine. On the 
other hand, slight quantities of nitric acid disappear from wine in time. 



DECISION ON WINE. 249 

upon health, as any poisons contained in the water will be 
strongly diluted, and the majority of pathogenic schizomy- 
cetes will be rather speedily destroyed. Still the possibility 
is admitted that an addition of unwholesome water might 
render wine injurious to health. 

9. Ash. "Universally valid limits for the several mineral matters can- 
not be assumed. The supposition that the better growths of wine always 
contain more phosphoric acid than the inferior sorts is unfounded." 

" Wines which contain less than 0'14 mineral matter per 100 cc. are 
to be condemned, unless it can be proved that natural wines from the 
same position, and of the same season, which have been submitted to 
the same treatment, are found with similarly low quantities of mineral 
substances." 

" Wines which contain more than 0'05 grm. sodium chloride in 100 cc. 
are to be condemned. The proportion of chlorine in pure wines varies 
from 2 to 6 mgrm. in 100, corresponding to from 3 to 10 mgrm. of 
sodium chloride. Clarifying ingredients rich in salt, well-waters 
abounding in salt (and therefore in general greatly polluted), and the 
intentional addition of salt (in order to increase the ash), are to blame 
for the high percentage of sodium chloride. Hence such a proportion 
of salt is often the indication of a composition which -is hygienically 
objectionable. The proportion of phosphoric acid rarely falls below 
20 mgrm. for 100 cc. in pure wines. 

" Wines which contain more than 0'092 grm. sulphuric acid 
(S0 3 ), corresponding to 0'20 grm. potassium sulphate (K 2 S0 4 ), 
in 100 cc. are to be characterised as having become too rich 
in sulphuric acid, whether by plastering or in some other 
manner, e.g., strong and often repeated sulphuring ( 233)." 

Though a proportion slightly exceeding 2 grm. potassium 
sulphate per litre may perhaps be tolerated without injury 
by the majority of persons, the view taken in this resolu- 
tion must be strongly approved and supported on hygienic 
grounds. 1 

1 It must be remarked that if judged by this rule numerous old wines, 
certainly not plastered but frequently sulphured, would have to be condemned. 
Thus List has repeatedly found 077 to 0*89 grm. SOs per litre in wines from 
the cellars of palaces, and in older wines (1783 to 1822) several times from 
1*3 to 1'5 grm. SOs. The former figures would represent nearly 2 grm., and 
the latter about 3 grm., potassium sulphate per litre. These were wines famed 
as genuine medical wines. Compare E. List, Ueber den Schwefelsaurcgehalt 
des Weines in 6 Vortrage aus dem Gebiete der Nahrunysmittclchemie, Wurzburg, 
1883. 



250 WINE. 

Marty, in a communication to the Academic de Medec., 
stated that after the prolonged use of wine containing # *8 
grm. ( = 1*74 S0 3 ) potassium sulphate per litre, he felt unwell. 
The symptoms were discomfort, acid eructations, and colic. 

10. Sulphurous and salicylic acids are to be judged accord- 
ing to 228 and 229. Large doses of sulphuric acid, and 
the presence of salicylic acid, always suggest that we have 
before us a product of poor keeping properties, which may, 
perhaps, have already been in a state of incipient decom- 
position. (See 234 and 235.) 

11. Vegetable colouring-matters are almost all hygieni- 
cally inert ; l none of the plants yielding colouring-matters 
is hurtful with the exception of Phytolacca decandra the 
fine blackish violet berries of this plant, which is often 
cultivated in the South for the purpose of colouring wines. 
Children have frequently, after eating them, been attacked 
with vomiting and diarrhoea. Maqui-berries are used in 
their native country for the manufacture of jams, and seem 
therefore harmless. 

12. Keel coal-tar colours are probably for the most part 
harmless ; but as some of them may be injurious, and as their 
use is unattended with any advantage, they are rightfully 
prohibited. As cheap waste colours, manufacturing residues, 
&c., have been in use, and perhaps still are, it is pointed 
out that the harmlessness of the pure colours by no means 
involves the harmlessness of these waste products ; a pro- 
portion of arsenic was formerly frequent. (See 494, &c.) 

If we finally sum up the decision of hygiene on the most 
important methods of improving and increasing wine, and on 
the manufacture of artificial wines, we must say that the 
addition of water, sugar, alcohol, moderate quantities of 
glycerine and vegetable colouring- matters (mallows, bil- 
berries, elder-berries), cannot be regarded as unwholesome as 
long as 

1. The product obtained is sound, capable of keeping, and 
not too rich in alcohol.

physiologically indifferent. Editor. 



SWEET WINES AND MEDICINAL WINES. 251 

2. The additions themselves are not contaminated; at 
most the addition of glycerine might perhaps be regarded 
as objectionable. 

Impure water, impure spirit, impure potato-sugar, artificial 
colouring-matters, the addition of bouquet materials, render 
wine suspected of unwholesomeness. If such hurtful pro- 
perties do not always exist, if they are not always capable 
of demonstration, or if, as in the case of potato-sugar, they 
have been greatly exaggerated, hygiene must nevertheless, on 
principle, condemn the use of such substances, as they may 
occasion derangements of health, and as there is no ground 
for their permission. 

APPENDIX I. SOUTHERN WINES, SWEET WINES, 
AND MEDICINAL WINES. 

402. As " southern wines " we meet with wines from the 
sweet grapes of semi-tropical regions. The concentration of 
the must is further increased by the use of raisins, " straw- 
grapes," l &c. According to List we may conveniently 
distinguish : 

1. Dry Wines (vino seco), poor in sugar (containing not more than 
^ per cent, of sugar), rich in alcohol, and generally poor in glycerine ; 
obtained by the rapid fermentation at a high temperature of the grapes 
of southern climates, and having undergone at most a moderate addition 
of alcohol. 

2. Sweet Wines (vino dulce). Wines from southern grapes, to which 
there has been added after fermentation the inspissated must of sugary 
grapes, or the sweet juices of other fruits, such as dates, figs. &c. At 
the same time they often receive an addition of pure spirit, of cognac, 
liqueurs, and often of colouring-matters, such as inspissated scorched 
must, elder-berries, &c. Such wines contain from 4 to 15 per cent, of 
reductive sugar ; the difference of extract minus sugar must amount to 
at least 4 grm., and the phosphoric acid 40 mgrm., in 100 cc. 

The Hungarian wines of the first pressing (i.e., Tokay) are obtained 
from grapes rich in sugar, to which there are added during pressing 
large quantities of dry grapes (i.e., raisins which have been left on 
the vines). 

In many cases bungling imitations of the genuine sweet 
wines are concocted from inferior southern or Hungarian 

1 I.e., grapes plucked and spread out on straw in the sun. 



252 WINE. 

wines by an addition of alcohol, cane- or invert-sugar, and 
sugar-colour; but recently cane-sugar is often added, even 
to the superior southern wines, instead of the more costly 
inspissated must or of raisins. 

A decision on such wines concerns the hygienist only 
when they are offered for sale as medicinal wines ; as dessert 
wines, beverages of luxury, they do not concern the hygienist, 
as even the most wretched imitations can scarcely occasion 
any injury to health, and may be consumed with pleasure by 
those who like them. 

It is not easy to say what demands are to be made upon 
wines which are declared on the labels to be "medicinal 
wines," since wine may be prescribed for very various pur- 
poses (e.g., as stimulans, as antidiarrhoi'cum, &c.). For 
many purposes the alcohol is the most important ingredient, 
and for others the tannin ; sugar is often very welcome 
(agreeable taste), and often very unsuitable (in various affec- 
tions of the stomach). The demands of the Free Association 
of Bavarian Chemists appear very suitable, as rendering it 
more easy for the physician to make a selection among the 
different kinds : 

1. Medicinal wines may not contain more sulphuric acid 

than corresponds to 1 grm. potassium sulphate per 
litre (compare 401). As much as 4 grm. potassium 
sulphate have been found in southern medicinal wines. 

2. Medicinal wines must contain no sulphurous acid. 

3. In medicinal wines the proportion of sugar and alcohol 

must be given on the labels of the bottles in per- 
centages of weight ; it may be desirable to know the 
acidity, and in red wines the proportion of tannin. 
Hence it appears perfectly permissible to use for medi- 
cinal purposes native (i.e., German) wines of known quality, 
in which no great acidity must be present, not above 0'6 per 
cent. See Yon Kerschensteiner, Fifth Meeting of Bavarian 
Chemists, 1887, pp. 59 and 60. 

At the Xinth Congress of Bavarian Chemists, just con- 
cluded, medicinal wines are denned as " wines employed in 
preparing medicines" (Chemiker Zeitung, 1890, No. 42). It

would be greatly to be regretted, from a hygienic point of 
view, if the strict requirements laid down for wines sold 
especially for the use of sick persons were not retained, 
especially the third stipulation. 

To consider champagne and effervescing wines would take 
us too far. On their hygienic meaning nothing of any con- 
sequence can be said, save that the high percentage of sugar, 
and perhaps the excessive addition of flavourings, may in- 
terfere with the wholesomeness of some brands. 1 See F. 
List, Die Schaumweine (Eighth Congress of Bavarian Chemists 
at Wurzburg, 1889). 

APPENDIX II. INITIAL POINTS FOE EXAMINING 
SPOILED WINES, WINES OF ABNORMAL ODOUE 
AND TASTE, AND WINES ENGAGED IN FERMEN- 
TATION. 

403. In examining if a wine is spoiled or not, in very 
many cases the taste and smell on careful observation will 
suffice, even for a non-expert. Hitherto, indeed, the follow- 
ing typical diseases of wine are known, which are all to be 
referred to microbia as yet insufficiently studied. 

I follow here E. List, who at the Sixth Congress of 
Bavarian Chemists at Munich, 1887, gave a survey of the 
position of the question, with further literary notices. 

The bacteriological investigation should be attempted with 
wine-gelatine (1 litre wine and 100 gelatine, &c.), or with 
wine which has been rendered free from microbia by filtra- 
tion through cells of biscuit porcelain. 

1. Formation of mould by saccliaromyces (Mycoderma vini, Pasteur; 
Saccharomyces mycoderma, Eees). Flourishes especially on the surface 
of wines poor in alcohol ; the complete layers sink to the bottom, and 
make room for new strata. Ferments alcohol into C0 2 and water. A 
proportion of 11 to 12 per cent, of alcohol is a protection against this 
microbe. The wine tastes flat. 

2. Acetic Fermentation of alcohol by Bacillus aceticus, a very short

purely a dessert-wine, and that the dry qualities are much less sought after 
than in Britain. Editor.

bacillus, sometimes hanging together like a necklace, forming thick 
layers, but imperfectly studied. It is even capable of attacking wines 
containing 12 per cent, of alcohol. This process, which leads to ail 
absolute destruction of the value of the wine, can be arrested only by 
pasteurising. The presence of 0'05 per cent, of acetic acid does not 
interfere. It occurs not rarely in southern red wines. For the acetic 
acid microbia see Zeidler (Centralblatt f. Balderiologie, ix. 10). 

3. The Breaking or Inversion of Wine. The tartaric and malic acid, 
the tannin and the colouring-matter are destroyed, and the alcohol 
disappears. The colourless liquid contains chiefly potassium carbonate, 
along with a series of volatile fatty acids. In this process, according 
to Pasteur, two species of microbia are concerned. E. Kramer (Land- 
ivirthschaftliche Versuchstationen, xxxvii., p. 325) detected seven bacilli 
and two cocci, for the study of which the original must be consulted. 

4. In the ropiiiess of wines the sugar of new wines passes into a 
gummy substance. 

Kramer has recently published some remarks on the bacillus which 
occasions the mucic fermentation of wine (at the expense of the glucose), 
Bacillus viscoaus vini, Kramer (Monatshefte fur Cheinie, 1889, p. 467). It 
is a short bacillus, often linked together in long chains. A distinct 
form is the Bacilli's riscosus sacchari, Kramer, which succeeds only on 
neutral or slightly alkaline media containing cane-sugar ; again dis- 
tinct is the micrococcus of ropy milk ( 285). 

5. The bitterness of red wines seems to be occasioned by a bacillus. 
Even old wines become bitter in the bottles. (See Haas, Allgem. Wein 
Zeitnng, 1891, p. 4.) 

Moreover, wines, especially such as have been already deprived of their 
alcohol by one of these micro-organisms, may be further decomposed 
by hyphomycetes and septic organisms. 

In all these diseases the colour is usually altered. Red wines espe- 
cially become brownish, turbid, and even colourless. 

Blackening of wine 1 occurs also if wine comes in prolonged contact 
with rusting iron (nails, the hoops of casks). If the wine is slightly 
acid, black iron taunate is precipitated at once ; if it is strongly acid, 
blackening takes place only on neutralising the acid, i.e., on admixture 
with soda-water (sodium bicarbonate). 

Wine may from various causes assume the taste and smell of sulphu- 
retted hydrogen, c.y., by absorbing sulphur compounds from the soil, 
by standing for a long time on lees sprinkled with powdered sulphur, 
or in casks into which sulphur has fallen during fumigating, by the 
activity of saccharomycetes, and lastly, by the putrefaction of the 
residual dregs in the cask. 

Iii how far these diseases of wine may render it unwhole- 



1 Subsequent darkening of white wines on exposure in a glass for some 
hours may be either a sign of the use of over-ripe grapes or of piquette. It 
has no hygienic importance. 



FERMENTING MUST AND NEW WINE. 255 

some to man is. scarcely yet known. In any case they 
render it worthless as an article of enjoyment, and should 
therefore at once exclude it from sale. Nos. 1 and 2 are 
mostly commonly observed, but also the other diseases are 
often a great plague in many districts. Deficiency of alcohol, 
the use of rotten grapes, prolonged fermentation on the skins, 
warm cellars, premature bottling, &c., are the most frequent 
causes of the decompositions of wine. The presence of sul- 
phuretted hydrogen is generally difficult to decide on, but 
it must be regarded as much more serious if it is due to 
processes of putrefaction. Blackening in consequence of the 
presence of iron is in itself not hygienically objectionable ; 
but wine will probably not keep as well if its tannin is in 
combination with iron. 

The clarification of dull wines with gelatine, isinglass, or 
albumen (if needful, with the judicious use of tannic acid), 
which form a voluminous precipitate and carry down all sus- 
pended matter, must be pronounced hygienically free from 
objection ; clarification with blood or milk is less rational. 
Blood may possibly introduce pathogenic microbia (the 
bacilli of tubercle remain alive for three days in alcohol 
at 46 per cent.); milk is said to have introduced lactic 
fermentation. 



APPENDIX III. FERMENTING MUST AND 
FERMENTING NEW WINE. 1 

404. Whilst fresh unfermented grape-juice is drunk 
only in the so-called grape-cure, the fermenting must, in 
all stages of its development, plays an important part as a 
delicacy in all the wine countries. It is rich in carbonic 
acid and turbid from accumulations of yeast ; its composi- 
tion is intermediate between those of wine and of must, and 
the proportion of alcohol fluctuates greatly. The ingestion 

1 Two German synonyms " Federvveisser " and "Sauser " do not admit 
of intelligible translation. " Federweisser " literally means something white, 
like feathers or down. " Sauser " = buzzer or hummer, from the buzzing 
noise made by the fermenting must. 



256 WINE. 

of yeast is evidently as a rule harmless ( 378). Among 
the new points of view considered in the examination of 
and the decision on wine, it must be remembered that fer- 
mentation is often forcibly repressed by strong doses of 
salicylic or sulphurous acid. 

APPENDIX IV. FRUIT-MUST AND FRUIT- WINE. 

405. Pleasant and even fine beverages are obtained from 
apples (cider), from pears (perry), and in many places also 
from currants, 1 gooseberries, and bilberries, with or with- 
out the addition of sugar. (For the analysis of these liquors 
see Table X.) 

Without the addition of sugar to the apples no cider can 
1 >e obtained which will remain good for more than two years. 
The addition of sugar to the must, or of alcohol to the wine, 
are necessary if the wine is to remain sound. 

Pure cider contains about from 3 '6 to 6'1 per cent, of 
alcohol, and a proportion of 10 per cent, renders it perfectly 
fit for keeping. (See A r on Hoffmann, Vicrtcljalir. f. Gcr. 
Mcdicin, 1890, p. 115.) The examination and the hygienic 
decision are substantially the same as for wine. 

Mixtures of grape- and fruit- wines are said to be often 
sold as wine. This fraud does not concern hygiene. 

APPENDIX V. VINEGAR. 
A. Examination. 

40G. Vinegar is essentially acetic acid tit 3 to 8 per cent, 
(generally 4 to 5 per cent.), containing a little acetic ether, 
and diluted with water. Various other ingredients are added 
during preparation. We distinguish three kinds of vinegar : 

1. Obtained from alcoholic liquids by the acetic fermentation. The 
alcohol in wine, beer, cider, &c., Tinder certain circumstances is con- 
verted into acetic acid by the Bacillus aceticus ( 403). 



1 We have tasted red currant wine which had been in bottle twenty years, 
and was in excellent condition, far superior to the "British wines" of 
commerce. Editor. 



VINEGAR. 257 

Vinegar thus obtained always contains tartrates, acetates, phosphates, 
&c., which on ignition leave an alkaline ash. 

Only wine-vinegar contains potassium tartrate, but tartaric acid is 
sometimes intentionally added to spirit- vinegar which is to be sold as 
wine-vinegar. 

2. Produced by the quick vinegar process. Dilute alcohol in contact 
with air trickles over shavings of beech-wood, and is converted into 
acetic acid, perhaps with the joint action of microbia. Thus a strong 
vinegar is produced (spirit- vinegar), containing from 8 to 10 per cent, 
of acid, which is sold in a diluted state. It contains salts only to a 
small extent. 

3. Obtained by the dry distillation of wood. The brown, crude 
wood vinegar has an empyreuinatic odour. When carefully rectified 
it yields a very pure acetic acid (essence of vinegar) of about 70 per 
cent., from which cheap vinegar is obtained. Salts are introduced 
merely to a slight extent by the water used for dilution. 

The strength of vinegar is ascertained by titration with 
normal soda- lye, using phenolphthaleine as indicator. To 
each cubic centimetre of lye there corresponds 0'06 grm. of 
acetic acid. Hence, if for titrating 20 cc. of vinegar (strictly 
speaking, 20 grm:) there have been used 12 cc. normal lye, of 
this portion 0'72 grm. or 100 cc. vinegar contain 3 '6 grm. 
acetic acid. 

Falsifications of vinegar with sulphuric and hydrochloric 
acid have occurred, and, it is alleged, also with nitric acid. 1 
The addition of tartaric acid, which is more expensive than 
acetic acid, serves merely to simulate wine-vinegar. 

Free mineral acids are detected by adding from 4 to 5 
drops of a O'l per thousand solution of methyl- violet (Stock- 
meier recommends the mark B 2 N".56, by Bayer, of Elberfeld). 
If only from O'l to 0'05 per cent, of a free mineral acid is 
present, the violet colour passes into a bluish green or 
green ; in pure acetic acid there occurs no change of colour. 
According to Lunge a few drops of a solution of tropeoline 
(Mark 00) colour pure vinegar yellow, but red if free 
mineral acids are present. 

For the quantitative determination of the free mineral acids we 
proceed according to Hilger (Arch. f. Hygiene, viii. 448) : 20 cc. of the 
vinegar in question are exactly neutralised with normal alkali by 



1 The presence of nitric acid in vinegar is very doubtful. Editor. 
VOL. II. R 



258 WINE. 

means of the " spotting " method ; the neutral liquid is concentrated 
on the water-bath to the tenth part of its volume, mixed with a few 
drops of the solution of methyl-violet, diluted with water to about 
3 to 4 cc., and mixed, whilst hot, with normal sulphuric acid until the 
change of colour (violet into green), which is very distinct. The normal 
sulphuric acid consumed is deducted from the normal alkali, and the 
residue of normal alkali is calculated for the mineral acid present. 
1 cc. normal alkali = O049 grm. sulphuric acid (HoSOi). 

Example. 20 cc. of vinegar consume 14'15 cc. of normal alkali. 
After the concentration with methyl-violet as indicator, there are con- 
sumed 13'3 cc. of normal sulphuric acid. The difference is 0'85 cc. 
normal alkali. Therefore in 20 cc. : 13-3 x 0'06 = 0'798 acetic acid, 
and 0'85 x 0*049 = 0'042 grm. sulphuric acid, or 3*99 per cent, acetic 
acid and - 2 per cent, sulphuric acid. 

A little hydrochloric and sulphuric acid are found in every vinegar 
in the state of salts ; a quantitative examination is in general thought 
requisite only if free mineral acids are detected. 

If vinegar has still a pungent taste, and is not flat after 
exact neutralisation, it contains a fraudulent addition of 
acrid vegetable matter : pepper, capsicum, grains of Para- 
dise, &c. Vinegar has been met with containing I per cent. 
of amylic alcohol, and with appreciable quantities of cresolic 
acid. 

B. Decision. 

407. Without any appreciable nutritive value, vinegar 
is an important relish for food, and it is extensively used as 
a preservative agent. The three kinds of vinegar described 
may be regarded as nearly equal from a hygienic point of 
view. Wine-vinegar is justly valued more highly, as it 
contains traces of compounds of a pleasant odour and flavour. 1 

Vinegar with only from 1 to 2 per cent, of acetic acid, 
as occasionally happens, is to be condemned as inferior in 
value, not capable of keeping, and unfit for the purposes of 
preservation. The Bavarian food-chemists rightly demand 



1 The cider-vinegars of America, and the sugar- and honey-vinegars made 
on the small scale in England, have a very similar aroma. On the other 
hand, the spirit- and the wood- vinegars, the beer-vinegars provincially called 
"alegar" and even the malt-vinegars so much vaunted in England, however 
strong and free from adulteration, are deficient in aroma. The question has 
been raised whether the presence of dextrine may not interfere with the 
production of esters. Editor. 



BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WINE. 259 

4 per cent, of acetic acid as a minimum. Concerning an 
injurious action of Awguillula oxyphila (vinegar-eels), nothing 
trustworthy is known. The worms, from 1 to 2J mm. in 
length, which are often found in extraordinary abundance, 
especially in weak vinegar, render it disgusting. Lindner 
(Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, vi.) has recently attempted to 
render the injurious character of the vinegar-eels probable 
in an extensive memoir, but without real evidence. 

Free mineral acids have no right to be present in vinegar, 
and represent a coarse sophistication. Still I do not feel at 
liberty to pronounce an addition of from to 1 per cent, of 
mineral acid directly injurious to health. That powerful 
acids may occasion disturbances of the stomach is well 
known, just as may result from the use of strong vinegar. 
The mineral acids in very low degrees of concentration may 
be more pernicious than acetic acid, but it is scarcely satis- 
factorily proved. 

The acid substances commonly used rank among our 
ordinary spices, and must be judged as such. The use of 
substances whose effects are not accurately known, e.g., the 
berries and the bark of the mezereon, must of course be 
condemned, as under some circumstances dangerous to 
health.

SECTION XV. 

BRANDIES FOR DRINKING AND CHOICE 
SPIRITS. 

408. The various brandies and liquors are obtained by 
the distillation of fermented liquids from sacchariferous por- 
tions of plants (cherries, damsons, gentian roots, &c.), but more 
simply by diluting alcohol with water, and adding aromatic 
substances, ethereal oils, sugar, colouring-matters, &c. 

The spirit of commerce (industrial alcohols of the French) 
is obtained in Germany from potatoes, more rarely from 
grain (rye, maize), 1 by saccharifying the boiled materials 
with malt ( 365), fermenting them by means of yeast, and 
distilling off the alcohol. With the improved distilling 
apparatus now in use a crude spirit is at once obtained 
containing about 90 per cent, of alcohol. The alcohol is 
defuselised in general in special rectifying works, i.e., it is 
mixed with an equal volume of water, filtered over fresh 
wood-charcoal, and then submitted to fractionated distilla- 
tion. The first running consists principally of aldehyde, 
then follow grades of ethylic alcohol of different purity, the 
two best of which are known as wine-spirit and fine-spirit ; 
prime and second spirit are inferior sorts, and the last pro- 
duct of distillation is the after-running. Crude potato-spirit 
contains as much as 3 per cent, of fusel oil, under which 
name are included all the volatile products other than alde- 
hyde, ethylic alcohol, and water. The finest sorts of spirits 
are free from fusel oil. The lowest contain 1 per cent., or 
even more. The after - runnings are very rich in fusel. 
Spirit for burning may occasionally contain as much as 10 
per cent, of fusel-oil.

from maize. Editor.

Single brandies contain from 20 to 38 per cent, by volume 
of alcohol, and are obtained by the addition of water to 
ordinary alcohol ; more frequently they are rectified over 
carraway, aniseed, fennel, or juniper berries, from which 
they take up the ethereal oils. Often the latter are added 
directly. 

Double brandies contain about 36 volumes per cent, of 
alcohol, and about 13 per cent, of sugar, along with aro- 
matic substances. 

Corn Irandy is a spirit from a mash of grain intentionally 
not completely rectified, and diluted with water. Its colour 
is partly extracted from the wood of the casks on lying, and 
partly produced by the addition of burnt-sugar. It is often 
got up by adding strongly fuseliferous corn brandy of a 
characteristic taste to potato-spirit * poor in fusel. 

Kirsch wasscr (cherry brandy), maraschino (from the fruits 
of Prumis mahalel) and mountain ash), spirit prepared by 
distilling the fermented fruits, contain from O'OOo to O'Ol 
per cent, of hydrocyanic acid. 

Lees-spirit is obtained by distilling the residue from the 
preparation of wine. Cognac (French brandy) is produced 
by distilling the wine itself. 

Cofjnac contains about GO per cent, by volume of ethylic 
alcohol, and it is exposed to the most multifarious imitations, 
especially by the addition of " cognac essence " (an artificial 



1 Corn brandy makes the nearest approach to whiskey, but it is a much 
inferior spirit. Editor. 



BRANDIES FOR DRINKING AND CHOICE SPIRITS. 263 

mixture of fruit-ethers to fine-spirit and water). Genuine 
cognac comes from the Charente, especially from the town 
Cognac, but cognac is now also manufactured in Germany, 
and in other countries. 

According to the researches of Pasteur, Morin, and Ordonneau, cognac 
is chiefly distinguished from the industrial alcohols by its large per- 
centage of normal butylic alcohol. The industrial alcohols contain in 
its stead isobutylic alcohol, which has a much less pleasant taste. In 
cognac there are also found aldehyde, acetic ether, acetone, normal pro- 
pylic alcohol, amylic, hexylic, heptylic alcohols, the propionic, butyric, 
caprylic, and cenanthic esters and amine bases. A terpene very sparingly 
volatile is also a condition of the flavour. 

Rum is obtained from the fermented treacle, and the 
residues of the sugar-cane and arrac, chiefly from a mash 
of rice. 1 The preparation of these exotic spirits is often 
insufficiently known ; the addition of various flavouring- 
matters is very general. 

All the above-named superior spirits contain higher 
alcohols of a pleasant flavour, but in part still little known. 
In consistency, science is compelled to include these sub- 
stances under the name of fusel oils. 

Liqueurs are either alcoholic extracts of plants, filtered or 
distilled, or fine-spirit perfumed with ethereal oils, almost 
always with a plentiful addition of cane-sugar, and often 
with colouring-matters. So-called health-liqueurs contain 
not uncommonly hazardous bitter drugs (aloes), but more 
generally they are harmless, sweetened extracts of orange- 
peel, rhubarb, bitter drugs, calamus, spices, &c. 

409. All these spirituous liquors are conveniently divided 
into two groups : draught-brandies and spirits which are 
luxuries. The first category only is consumed to such an 
extent, and in such quantities, that practical hygiene can 
take closer cognisance of its composition. The unlimited 
variety renders it further very difficult to establish fixed 
rules for the spirits of luxury. 



1 Genuine arrac shcmld be distilled from the fermented juice of the cocoa- 
nut palm. It is, however, frequently distilled from rice and sugar, fermented 
with the cocoa-nut juice. Editor. 



264 BRANDIES FOR DRINKING AND CHOICE SPIRITS. 

A sharp boundary -line cannot be drawn between both 
groups, but for the present we may characterise as draught- 
brandies those intended for drinking on the large scale, 
which are indigenous, generally not sweetened, only slightly 
flavoured with ethereal oils (carraway, juniper, &C. 1 ), and 
kept on draught. They consist generally of diluted potato- 
spirit, corn-spirit, or lees-brandy. 

As spirits of luxury we must characterise those kept and 
sold in original bottles, imported or made from the finest 
native ingredients, generally sweetened, and more expensive. 

We generally examine the draught-brandies only for the 
presence of injurious substances mixed with the alcohol. 
The luxury-spirits are examined only if they are genuine 
products, which has no hygienic interest. The following 
explanations apply only to draught- spirits. A few apho- 
ristic remarks are appended on the spirits of luxury. 

A. Examination of Draught-Spirits. 

410. The specific gravity is determined according to 
309. In ordinary spirits, containing neither sugar nor 
vegetable extractive substances, we may ascertain the per- 
centage of alcohol from the specific gravity with tolerable 
accuracy by means of Table XVI. 

It is generally expressed in volumes per cent., i.e., ->' cc. 
alcohol in 1.00 cc. of spirit. The recalculation to grammes in 
100 cc. is effected by multiplying the ,/ found by 0'79.*>8 (the 
specific gravity of alcohol). 

The determination of alcohol, however, must in general be 
preceded by distillation as for wine ( :>S8). The ethereal 
oils and ethers which pass over into the distillate are so 
trifling in quantity as not to affect the accuracy of the 
result. If a determination of fusel oil is performed, it may 
accompany the determination of the alcohol. 

The dry residue and the ash are determined as for wine (^ 389 
and 398). The sugar (fruit- and grape-sugar) are determined directly,

of Germany. Juniper npproximates to gin, or rather to "Geneva." Editor. 



EXAMINATION OF DRAUGHT-SPIRITS. 265 

and the cane-sugar after inversion with acid. Copper is sought for 
colorimetrically with a freshly prepared solution of potassium ferro- 
cyanide. It may be derived from the distillery plant. 

Ammonia, nitric acid, and nitrous acid, which may be introduced into 
spirits by bad water, are detected according to 194, 181, and 183. 

Sulphuric acid, or minute quantities of ammonium hydrocyanate, is 
sometimes added to spirits to make them "bead" better. Free sul- 
phuric acid is determined in the residue from distillation, according to 
406. The ash must also be tested for alumina, since alum is some- 
times used for clarifying. According to Sonnenschein alum is said to 
remove the smell of fusel. 

For the determination of hydrocyanic acid 10 cc. of spirit are care- 
fully superstratified with 1 '5 cc. of recently prepared tincture of guiacum 
(from one part of guiacum resin, and five parts alcohol) and solution of 
copper sulphate at ^ per cent. The liquids are then suddenly mixed, 
and the intensity of the blue coloration is measured against comparative 
liquids obtained by adding officinal bitter-almond water of a known 
strength of hydrocyanic acid to 50 per cent, alcohol in different pro- 
portions. Officinal water of bitter almonds contains exactly O'l per 
cent, hydrocyanic acid HCN. 

Nitre-benzol. If we suspect that an odour of bitter almonds is derived 
from nitre-benzol instead of from oil of bitter almonds (benzo-aldehyd), 
we add to about 50 cc. some zinc and mineral acid. It is better to 
distil away the chief portion of the alcohol from about 200 cc. of the 
spirit and examine the residue. By means of reduction with zinc and 
hydrochloric acid aniline is formed, which may be separated by 
rendering the mixture alkaline with soda-lye, and then shaking out the 
mixture with ether. If a splinter of pine- wood moistened with dilute 
sulphuric acid is dipped into the aniliniferous liquid it takes on drying 
an intense yellow colour. Aniline takes a rose-violet colour with a 
solution of chloride of lime. 

If an addition of denaturised spirit l is suspected (the official pre- 
scription being 2^ litres of a mixture of four parts wood-spirit and one 
part of pyridine to 100 litres of alcohol), it is better to test for the 
pyridine bases (Schweissinger, Pharm. Centralhalle, 1890, p. 141) rather 
than for methylic alcohol, the detection of which is difficult and 
uncertain. 10 cc. of the distillate is mixed with ten drops of a con- 
centrated (20 per cent.) solution of mercuric chloride, shaken up and 
allowed to subside. To a second similar test we add further 10 cc. of 
pure alcohol, and as a counter-check there are used quantities of alcohol 
of 10 cc., each mixed respectively with 0'5 and 0'25 cc. of the denaturised 
spirit. There appears a white precipitate, or at least a turbidity of 
mercuric chloride pyridine (HgCl 2 . C 5 H 5 N). In this manner 5 per 
cent, of denaturised spirit (=0'025 per cent, of pyridine) may be 
detected with certainty. An addition of 1 per cent, of denaturised 
spirit to draught-spirits is very distinct and unpleasant to the taste.

411. Fusel OIL A preliminary test for the presence of 
fusel oil can 'be made by rubbing a few drops of the alcohol 
on the hands and examining the smell. The brown colour 
on heating with concentrated sulphuric acid and various 
ingenious methods proposed by Uffelmann (Archf. Hygiene, 
iv.), are, according to Sell, not free from ambiguity, and may 
therefore be passed over. 

For the determination of fusel oil various methods have 
been proposed. The most convenient is that of Rose, which 
is now in general use. 

Principle. If pure chloroform is shaken up 
with alcohol at 30 per cent, by volume, the vol- 
ume of the chloroform is increased by taking up 
alcohol, If higher alcohols are present, even in 
very moderate proportion, the increase in the 
volume of the chloroform is rather considerable, 
and from the degree of this increase the per- 
centage of the higher alcohols may be deduced. 

Execution. (According to Sell, who has most thoroughly 
studied the method of Rose as improved by Stutzer and 
Reitmair) : 

Of 200 cc. of spirit, measured at 15, to which a few 
drops of potassa-lye have been added, four-fifths are dis- 
tilled off with an ascending condensing-tube (Fig. 85) and 
good refrigeration. The distillate is made up exactly like 
wine, at 15 to 200 -., with distilled water, and the specific 
gravity is determined. Hereupon we find in Table XV. 
the proportion of alcohol in percentages by volume (#), 
and calculate how much water (./) must be added to 100 cc. 
of the distillate in order to obtain an alcohol of 30 per 
cent, by volume.

This addition of water (or of alcohol) is effected gradually 
in a large flask, shaking vigorously, and cooling down to 
15. After the mixture we ascertain whether at 15 the specific gravity 
of the 30 per cent, alcohol 0-9656 has been exactly reached.

We now introduce into the apparatus here shown, which is introduced 
into water at 15, 20 cc. of the purest anhydrous chloroform cooled 
down to 15. It is allowed to flow in from a pipette without touching 
the sides of the apparatus until the lower meniscus of the chloroform 
coincides with the mark 20 ; 100 cc. of the 30 per cent, distillate are 
then added, and I cc. sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1'2857. 150 
strong agitating shocks are then given, and the drops of chloroform 
clinging to the sides are then united to the chief mass, which has col- 
lected at the bottom by means of a rotatory motion after the apparatus 
has been again placed in water at 15. 

The present volume of the chloroform is increased, e.g., to 21 '90. By 
direct reading off from the following table, we find that the proportion 
of fusel oil in the alcohol in question /= 0-1724 per cent.

It would take us too far to examine the influence of the numerous 
other constituents of the distillate aldehyde, acetal, furfurol, ethereal 
oils, &c. upon the quantitative result. We must here refer to Sell's 
exhaustive account. In ordinary draught-spirits the errors are not of 
great importance. 

The ethereal oils in slight quantities occasion a small decrease of the 
volume of the chloroform, but in large proportions they cause an 
increase.

B. Decision on Draught-Spirits. 

412. As it is beyond doubt that especially the use of 
spirits, the richest in alcohol among our beverages, produces 
the most severe affections of chronic alcoholism, the question 
has been repeatedly raised whether the danger cannot be 
restricted by means of legislation. It is at present certain 
that especially the strong draught brandies are hygienically 
objectionable. Of 265 samples of " schnaps " examined from 
all parts of Germany 

23 contained less than 30 per cent, alcohol by volume. 

24 from 30 to 35 
94 from 35 to 40 
81 ., from 40 to 45 
31 from 45 to 50 

9 ., from 50 to 78 ,, ,, 

Hygiene is not in a position to decide below what per- 
centage a spirit ceases to be injurious, but it may demand 
that for draught- spirits a certain maximum percentage of 
alcohol should be laid down, c.y., 40 per cent, by volume, as 
Bar proposes. 

If unanimity prevails among hygienists on this first point, 
there is a second which is still disputed, i.e., the question : 
In how far is the iujuriousness of spirits determined by the 
presence of fusel oil ? Whilst I must refer to Sell for the 
literature of this very difficult question, which, though ex- 
ceedingly voluminous, is poor in large systematic works, I 
bring into prominence merely the following main points: 

1. Beyond doubt all the other alcoholic-ethereal consti- 
tuents of spirits are more deleterious than ethylic alcohol. 

Dujardin-Beaumetz and Audige (Bulletin gen. de 7'herapeutique, 1875) 
state that a dog quickly dies if it has in its stomach, per kilogramme of 
its own weight : 

Ethylic alcohol . . . . 5*5 to 6'5 grm. 

Or propylic alcohol 1*76 grm. 

Or butylic alcohol ..... 1'80 grm. 

Or amylic alcohol . . . . 1'4 to 1'55 grm. 

Accordingly amylic alcohol is four times more poisonous than ethylic 
alcohol. 



EXAMINATION OF DRAUGHT-SPIRITS. 269 

Aldehyde is fatal to dogs in the proportion of 3'5 grm. per kilo- 
gramme of their weight. Aldehyde has an irritating taste and smell. 

Brockhaus made experiments upon himself with aldehyde, acetal, 
propylic, isobutyric, and amylic alcohols, all of which were more un- 
pleasant to take and more effective than ethylic alcohol. Unfortunately 
he states the doses taken only in drops.. Ten drops of aldehyde, 
suitably diluted, occasioned intense irritation, produced dizziness and 
headache ; 1 00 drops of amylic alcohol in ^ litre of wine caused a strong 
burning and irritating sensation in the mouth, and brought on pains 
in the stomach, nausea, and inebriation. According to these experi- 
ments on a man accustomed to alcohol, the substances in question were 
far more than four times (rather from ten to twenty-five times) more 
poisonous than ethylic alcohol (Centmlblatt f. allg. Gesundheitspflege, i. 
1882, p. 146. 

Among the basic principles which Morin described in fusel oils, and 
which are said to be produced by the action of ammonia upon glyce- 
rine, 1 grm. per kilogramme of the weight of the animal is sufficient to 
kill a rabbit. 

2. On the other hand, it cannot be said with certainty 
whether the quantities of fusel oils which occur in the 
majority of our draught-spirits (from below 0*2 to 0'3 per 
cent.) in reality appreciably intensify their hurtfulness. Of 
256 samples at the " Gesundheitsamt," 33 were free from 
fusel, 106 contained from to 01 per cent., 82 contained 
from 01 to 0-2, 29 from 0*2 to 0'3, and 6 from 0'3 to 0'5 
per cent. 

The experiments on the large scale instituted by Dujardin-Beaumetz 
and Audige on pigs, and carried out almost for three years, showed 
with probability a slighter imwholesomeness in potato-, beet-, and 
grain-spirit, purified as completely as possible, and free from fusel, as 
compared with impure sorts ; but here also contradictory results were 
observed, so that the authors themselves do not regard their laborious 
results as decisive. 

Among more recent results I may mention only those made by Strass- 
maim (Exper. Untersuchnng zur Lehre vom chron. Alkoholismus. Viertel- 
jahr. f. Gerickt. Med., 1888) on twelve dogs with ethylic alcohol at 32 
per cent, by volume, in which amylic alcohol was substituted for parts 
of the ethylic alcohol. 

Newer experiments also by Strassmann ( Viertelj. fur offent. Gesund- 
heit, 1890, vol. xxii.) showed no especial toxicity of small admixtures of 
fusel oils as far as dogs are concerned. 

Certainly f x cc. of alcohol at 30 per cent, free from fusel was much 
more hurtful than x cc. of 30 per cent, alcohol containing by volume 
0'4 per cent, of fusel. 

An artificial " schnaps " with 29 per cent, ethylic alcohol and 3 per 



270 BRANDIES FOR DRINKING AND CHOICE SPIRITS. 

cent, amylic alcohol proved fatal in half the usual time ; a mixture of 

31 per cent, ethylic alcohol and 1 per cent, of amylic alcohol caused 
intensification of many of the symptoms without accelerating death ; a 
mixture of 31 '1 per cent, of ethylic alcohol and 0'3 per cent, amylic 
alcohol produced no other effects than those of pure ethylic alcohol at 

32 per cent. 

Various inquirers have also experimented on man. 

Zuntz (in Sell, p. 347) seeks to refer the unpleasant action of 
fusel to its disagreeable smell and taste. He took for a considerable 
time doses of from 1 to 1^ grm. fusel in gelatine capsules without 
effects (corresponding to from 200 to 300 grm. of unusually fuseliferous 
brandy), and contends warmly that the action of spirits are so deleteri- 
ous, especially because the people who consume it are not as well 
nourished as beer and wine drinkers. Zuntz considers admixtures of 
0'3 to 0*4 per cent, of fusel not markedly injurious. 

However, the question of the toxicity of the fusel oils for 
man may be ultimately decided. I believe that hygiene may 
now on good grounds take up the following position : 

1. It is certain that the higher alcohols, aldehydes, esters, 
&c., are not absolutely necessary for the flavour of draught- 
spirits. The thirty- three kinds of spirits free from fusel 
which were examined in Berlin had, e.g., no unusual odours, 
or some of them were flavoured with the most varied aromas. 
Hence there is no necessity for a flavouring with fusel oil, or 
a minimum of this constituent might suffice. In Switzerland 
quantities of fusel oil not exceeding 0'2 (calculated for ab- 
solute alcohol) are permitted, which corresponds to O'l per 
cent, or less in the aqueous " schnaps." See CJicmiker 
Zdtung, 1890, Xo. 81. 

2. Even if the temptation to drink brandy were decreased 
by the elimination of the fusel oils, this would be decidedly 
no reason for their retention. 

3. Fusel oil is far more poisonous than ethylic alcohol. It 
is, indeed, not probable that a proportion of fusel oil below 
0%3 per cent, will render the action of ethylic alcohol more 
hurtful, but hygiene will rejoice over any legislative regula- 
tion of the question which demands a smaller proportion, say 
01 per cent. But we must emphasise the conclusion that 
we have hitherto no warrant for regarding the fusels of one 
kind of spirit as less injurious than those of another, and 



DECISION ON FINE SPIRITS AND LIQUEURS. 271 

judge those of a pleasant flavour more leniently than such as 
have a disagreeable taste. 

4. Though the removal of fusel oil is hygienically desir- 
able, it represents only a subordinate point in the contest 
against alcoholism. 

The other constituents of spirits have little importance. I 
cannot find a trace of sulphuric acid injurious to health. 
Constituents of impure water, copper, &c., must be judged 
according to 201. Pyridine bases are poisonous, but in the 
proportions in which they may find their way into draught 
spirits by the addition of denaturised spirit, they are scarcely 
injurious. Nitro-benzol is a very powerful poison : twenty 
drops have proved sufficient for fatal poisoning, hence its 
addition must be absolutely condemned. It is questionable 
whether the very small quantities of hydrocyanic acid, which 
may be found in kirsch-wasser, &c., have any hygienic 
(toxicological) signification. 



APPENDIX. DECISION ON FINE SPIRITS AND 
LIQUEURS. 

413. There can be no doubt that if the points of view 
which have been developed above for draught-spirits are 
correct, they must be here also decisive. Only the fact that 
these liqueurs which are mostly very rich in alcohol, as much 
as 50 to 80 per cent, by volume (and often very rich in fusel 
oils), are consumed merely in small quantities and riot 
habitually, can be adduced as a reason why hygiene has 
hitherto paid little attention to the meaning of these liquids. 
In fact, in deciding on these beverages the odour and taste 
of experienced connoisseurs play the chief part. Even a 
chemical examination throws very little light on the genuine- 
ness of a sample. In any case, quite special knowledge and 
materials for comparison are necessary. 

The recent investigations of Nessler and Earth (Zeit. f. 
Anal. Chemie, 1895), and W. Fresenius (ibid. 1890), and 
especially of Sell (see Bibliography), have proved the abso- 



272 BRANDIES FOR DRINKING AND CHOICE SPIRITS. 

lute incapacity of our present methods to recognise good 
imitations of cognac, arrack, and rum as falsifications. 

Only one fine liqueur has experienced a fairly unanimous 
decision and condemnation, i.e., absinth. It derives from 
wormwood (Artemisia, absyntliium) the poisonous ethereal oil 
of wormwood which aggravates the effects of alcohol to a 
very considerable extent, and produces muscular convulsions, 
klonic cramps, and epileptiform conditions in the type of 
chronic poisoning. The other vegetable ethereal oils (aniseed, 
fennel, &c.) are, according to Magnan, four or five times less 
injurious. 1

SECTION XVI. 

CLOTHING. 
A. Examination of Clothing. 

414. For a long time our clothing has been an object of 
diligent hygienic studies, which have been conducted with 
especial zeal for the last few years. All the physical pro- 
perties of the different tissues have been carefully studied, 
partly with the aid of very delicate methods, so that their 
investigation in different respects has become very easy. 
But as few of these methods are practically applicable, 
and as they often require a peculiar apparatus for their 
execution, they will be in the sequel in many cases merely 
mentioned or quoted. 1 

The most important questions are the following : 

1. Examination of the raw material employed. 

2. Examination of its behaviour with water and air. 

3. Examination of its thermic properties. 

4. Examination of colours and mordants with respect to 

their injurious influence upon health. 
See section on Domestic Kequisites (XVI 1 1.).

animals (species of goat, camel, alpaca, and vicuna). The 
two last-mentioned llama-like animals of South America 
yield peculiarly fine wool.

method, there is given merely a brief notice of its results. 

VOL. II. S

2. Silk, i.e., cocoon threads of the silk-moth (Bonibyx mori) 
and a series of other moths, especially the oak silk-moths 
(Anther ea yamamaya and Anther ea Pernyi), the Ailanthus- 
moth (Attacus cynthia], &c. A product of wild Indian 
cocoons has been introduced into trade as tussah-silk. 



II. From the Vegetable Kingdom. 

a. HATES. 

1. Cotton, i.e., the seed-hairs of the cotton shrubs, various 
species of the genus Gossypium. 

I. BAST FIBRES. 

1. Linen, from the flax-plant (Linum usitatissimum). 

2. Jute, from the tropical shrub (Corchorus capsularis). 
2. Hemp, from the hemp-plant (Cannabis sativa). 
Numerous other vegetable fibres play a subordinate part, 

though rather as stuffing material than for spinning. See 
Von Hb'hnel. 

410. In the diagnosis of these fibres chemical methods 
play merely a subordinate part. If the material has been 
finely fibrillated (if necessary, by prolonged boiling in water, 
alcohol, or exceedingly dilute acids applied witli caution), 
and freed us far as possible from colouring-matter, an ob- 
server of some experience 1 can generally, by a microscopic 
or micro-chemical examination, arrive at a certain decision 
in a few minutes. Fibres from the length and breadth of 
the tissue must always be examined separately, as the warp 
and the weft often consist of different materials. The tests 
and the reactions mentioned in the following explanations 
are : 

1. Ammoniacal solution of copper hydroxide, prepared by 
precipitating a solution of copper sulphate with a little 



1 The only difficulty is in the distinction between hemp and flax, which is 
hygienically unimportant. Intense dyes may render the diagnosis difficult. 



THE DISTINCTION OF THE TEXTILE FABRICS. 275 

ammonia, filtering off the cupric hydroxide in a funnel closed 
with glass wool, 1 and dissolving by pouring upon it a mini- 
mum of liquid ammonia. There is formed a deep blue 
liquid, which dissolves cellulose rather rapidly in the cold, 
but scarcely attacks lignified cellulose. 

2. Aniline sulphate. A few drops of aniline oil are 
allowed to fall into dilute sulphuric acid, shaken up, and 
filtered if necessary. Lignified cellulose, if moistened with 
a few drops of this reagent, takes an intense yellow colour 
in a few minutes, whilst pure cellulose is not changed. The 
lignine reaction disappears on bleaching. 

3. Molisch's reaction. A small specimen of the tissue, 
freed as much as possible from dyes by boiling in water, is 
covered with 2 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid, and there 
are added two drops of a solution of thymol in water (satu- 
rated in the cold). If carbohydrates are present (especially 
cellulose, i.e., vegetable fibre), the liquid takes a reddish- 
violet colour on agitation 

4. Reactions with iodine and sulphuric acid. Iodine solution = 
1 grm. potassium iodide in 100 cc. of distilled water, to which so much 
iodine has been added that a little remains undissolved at the bottom. 
Sulphuric acid = 2 vols. glycerine + 1 vol. distilled water + 3 vols. 
concentrated sulphuric acid, which are added slowly, whilst the vessel 
is continually refrigerated. 

The fibre is first treated with a little solution of iodine upon the 
port-object. The excess is removed, and from one to two drops of the 
sulphuric acid are added to the preparation, which is almost dry. Pure 
cellulose is coloured blue ; lignified cellulose, yellow. Fibres which 
have been dyed and bleached give quite different reactions.

28o CLOTHING. 

2. Behaviour of Clothing with Air and Water. 
1. BEHAVIOUR WITH AIR. 

417. For scientific purposes we proceed as in testing the 
permeability of building materials, according to Von Petten- 
kofer. A tube of 1 scm. in section, or preferably wider, is 
stretched over the tissue, and the air which passes through 
at a certain pressure (5 cm. of water as measured.) Every- 
thing depends on the degree of tension of the tissue, its being 
stretched smoothly, &c. For practical purposes a considera- 
tion of the material is generally sufficient, remembering the 
following relative figures determined by Yon Pettenkofer at 
a water-pressure of 4*5 cm. 

There passed through flannel . . 100 parts. 

medium tine linen 58 ,, 

silk ... 40 
., ,, buckskin . 58 ,, 

,, ,, kid-leather . . 1 ,, 

,, wash-leather . 51 ,, 

Xocht obtained much more considerable differences when he worked 
with a difference of water-pressure of only 0'04 water and pieces of 
tissue of 50'7 scm. : 

Flannel . . . 100 ' Old fustian . . 98 

Old flannel . .128 Linen . . .16 

Jager's cloth . . 150 Lahmann's cloth . 249 

Fustian . . . 25 

Nocht has further tested the permeability of wet tissues for air by the 
same method at pressures of 1 to 2 mm. The result was that if we take 
the permeability of dry flannel = 100, that of Lahmann's material (wet) 
was 28, Jager's material 3'0, and the other tissues of wool, cotton, and 
linen about 2. 

2. BEHAVIOUR WITH WATERY VAPOUR. 

418. A determination of the combining power of aeriform 
water is of subordinate interest. For all clothing material it 
is independent of the temperature, and depends merely on 
the relative moisture and the material. The determination 
is effected by accurately weighing specimens of cloth, previ- 
ously dried over sulphuric acid, in air-tight tin cases, exposing 



BEHAVIOUR WITH AIR AND WATER. 281 

them then to air of known moisture, and determining the 
increase of weight in J, 1, '2, and in 48 hours. In fog liquid 
water is suspended in the air, and the absorption of water 
rises very decidedly above the hygroscopic maximum. 

1000 grm. of dry cotton and linen absorb in two hours in air saturated 
with moisture about 80 grm., flannel absorbs 118 grm. of watery vapour. 
The colour has no influence. (Boubiioff, Arc/i.f. Hycj., i.) According 
to Noclit, cotton absorbs in forty-eight hours from 164 to 174 grm., 
linen 206 grm., and flannel 281 grm. 

3. BEHAVIOUR WITH LIQUID WATER. 

419. (a.) For determining the absolute capacity for water 
we plunge the air-dried tissues to be compared under water 
in a dish, and press them several times together. Lastly, we 
submit all the substances in question to pressure with the 
hand as equal as possible, and determine the increase of 
weight, which may be calculated for 100 scm. or 100 grm. 
Of course we obtain in this manner only comparative values, 
which indeed are somewhat fluctuating, as considerably more 
water remains in the elastic wool. In 100 grm. there were 
found

(Jtiger's tissue) (Lahmann's tissue) 

The first three samples were strongly pressed with the hand. The 
last samples were not pressed, but merely hung up to drain until water 
ceased to drop. 

(b.) The power of taking up water, i.e., the rapidity with 
which it absorbs water, is ascertained. (Compare Mense, C., 
Ueber das Verhalten von Kleidungsstqffen gegeniiber tropfbar- 
flilssigem Wasser. Dissertation, Munich, 1890.) 

1. By laying upon a capsule of water, and observing when 
it sinks. Warm water wets tissues much more rapidly than 
does cold. 

2. By stretching the cloth on a frame, allowing drops of 
water of a known size to fall upon it (e.g., -*$ to jV cc.). 



282 CLOTHING. 

3. By weighting slips of cloth by sewing a glass rod to 
their lower end and suspending them to the depth of 1 cm. 
in water (the level of which is kept constant), and observing 
the height and the speed of the rise of the moistened zone. 

Such experiments should always be made simultaneously 
with various specimens, remarking that wool (especially 
Jager's wool) was wetted most slowly, 1 then followed cotton 
and linen, while silk was wetted most rapidly. 

Tissues of the same material are wetted the less readily 
the heavier the dressing and the rougher the surface. Wash- 
ing increases the absorbent power of most materials, but in 
silk, which is rendered rougher, the contrary effect is pro- 
duced. A decided influence of the greater or less density of 
a tissue was remarkably not to be recognised. 

The following may serve as examples : 

Complete moistening, i.e., sinking of tissues floating upon water, took 
place, according to Mense :

If it is required to test tissues rendered water-proof by 
impregnation with certain salts (especially salts of alu- 
minium) we proceed in a similar manner, adding, however, 
an examination of the permeability for air, in order to 
ascertain whether it has been affected in this respect by the 
process of impregnation. 

Experiments on tissues which have been worn and washed 
are desirable to ascertain the durability of the water- 
proofing. 

1 Xocht found that ordinary flannel was wetted much less readily than 
Jager's wool. Lahmann's "reform cotton" behaved like Jager's wool. Half 
wool flannels were wetted with as much difficulty as pure wool. Old, worn 
woollen tissues were wetted very rapidly, perhaps because the epidermal coat- 
ing of the wool-fibre was injured. I found that extraction with ether had no 
influence on the capability of the wool for absorbing water. 



THERMIC PROPERTIES OF CLOTHING. 283 

(c.) Testing the behaviour of the clothing with sweat. 
According to the researches of E. Cramer (Arch.f. Hygiene, x.), 
a standard for the quantity of sweat absorbed may be found 
by determining the quantity of sodium chloride in the 
clothing. Sweat contains 0*38 per cent, sodium chloride ; 
the clothes are extracted by repeated applications of hot 
water, using a meat-press and titrating the chlorine in the 
collected and concentrated extracts. Cotton worn next to 
the skin retains the solid constituents of sweat much better 
than does wool, which allows them to travel into the outer 
layers of clothing. If a woollen shirt remains clean longer, 
the outer garments, if of woollen, are soiled the more. The 
soiling by sweat (as measured by the sodium chloride) on 
drawers, shirt, and socks (all of cotton) is in equal times 
as 1 : 2 : 8. 

(rf.) The elimination of the water taken up (drying) may be 
approximately determined by hanging up the tissues and 
weighing them at certain intervals. The behaviour of the 
hygroscopic water has no practical interest ; the escape of 
liquid water takes place much more slowly and uniformly 
from wool than it does from cotton and linen. 

In an instance given by Boubnoff wool evaporated, e.g., in. the first 
seven half hours, from 9'8 to 14*6 per cent, each, in all 87 '1 per cent, of 
water ; in the following half hours respectively 6*5, 4*5, and 1*9 per cent. 
Cotton and linen give off about 50 per cent, in the first half hour, in 
the second 30 per cent., and in the last half hour the remainder. In 
that time wool loses only about 36 per cent. According to Nocht, 
however, thick cotton tissues (fustian, Lahmann's tissue, &c.), behave 
like wool on drying, though he found thin linens dry more rapidly. 



3. Thermic Properties of Clothing. 

420. The qualities of clothing materials in reference to 
the conduction and radiation of heat concern us merely in 
as far as they affect the thermic economy of the body. 

The radiation of heat from the rough surfaces of clothing 
is greater than from the smooth skin (Rubiier), and it is 
approximately equal for all kinds of tissues (Krieger). They 
may be ascertained (Kubner) by observing a thermo-battery 



284 CLOTHING. 

placed at equal distances from equally heated surfaces of 
naked skin and of different tissues, behind the opening of a 
screen. 

For the dark rays of heat the absorption of heat is, it 
appears, approximately equal for all materials ; for bright 
heat rays it depends in the highest degree on the colour. 
Any differences in the various materials vanishes in com- 
parison. For determining the effect, Krieger (Zeit. f. Biologic, 
1869, p. 523) placed cylinders filled with cold water and 
covered with cloths of different colours at the same incli- 
nation to the rays of the sun, and determined the rise of 
temperature of the water. He obtained the following 
relative figures : 

Absorption through white shirting . . . .100 
,, pale yellow .... 102 
dark yellow . . . .140 
,, light green .... 155 
,, turkey red . . . .165 
,, dark green . . . .168 
light blue . . .198 
black 208 

Conduction of Heat. Every covering of the human body 
with badly conductive articles of clothing reduces the loss 
of heat (liubner and Eumpel, Arch. /. Hygiene, ix.), both 
indirectly and directly. 

On the one hand, the loss of heat by radiation is decreased 
since the temperature of the radiating surface is much 
reduced by the feeble conductive power of the clothing ; 
the promotion of radiation by the rough surfaces (see above) 
is thus far more than compensated. This is also shown by 
a thermo-battery to which the human body is placed opposite, 
behind a screen with an aperture. The several substances 
act in the proportion as they interfere with the radiation of 
heat. If the radiation of the naked body = 100, that of a 
person wearing a woollen shirt = 73, and if fully clothed 
only = 33 (liubner and Eurnpel). 

Secondly, the loss of heat by conduction is diminished 
since in the pores and interstices of the clothing there exists 



THERMIC PROPERTIES OF CLOTHING. 285 

a sparingly mobile stratum of air forming an exceedingly 
bad conductor of heat. 

To test the retardation of the conduction of heat 1 Krieger 
(Zeit.f. BioL, 1869) enveloped a sheet-metal cylinder filled 
with hot water successively in the substances to be tested, 
and observed the falling of a thermometer introduced. These 
experiments have been improved and extended, in a manner 
which may serve as a model, by Schuster (Arch. f. Hygiene, 
viii.). The latter observed by how many degrees centi- 
grade the cylinder cooled in forty minutes, when at the 
beginning of the experiment it was 33 warmer than its sur- 
roundings. In this method the loss of heat was reduced by 
thin linen tissue about 4, and of thick woollen cloth by 
18 to 27. A second layer, supported at some distance from 
the clothed cylinder by means of a fine wire framework, 
reduced the loss further by about 20. 

As the experiments showed that all clothing materials 
(perhaps with the exception of silk) are equally good or bad 
conductors of heat, but that their bad conductive power de- 
pends chiefly on the circumstance that much finely-divided, 
sparingly mobile air is inclosed in the loose tissue, an exami- 
nation of the texture of the material, and of its thickness, 
renders it possible to decide on its power of retaining heat, 
even without experiments. Wool, in addition to its loose 
texture, is further rendered retentive of heat by the circum- 
stance that its rough surface irritates the skin, and causes a 
determination of blood thither, and that its prominent hairs 
retain a moderately thick stratum of heat between the skin 
and the woollen shirt. 

Loss of Heat. The diminution of the total loss of heat in 
man by means of clothing has been shown by Eubner by his 
air-calorimeter (Zeit.f. Biologie, 1888), which depends mainly 
upon the principle of measuring the heat communicated to 
an enclosed volume of air by a human arm, its expansion 
being ascertained by a volumeter. A minute description of 



1 These experiments determine jointly the indirect and direct effect of 
the disturbed conduction of heat. 



286 CLOTHING. 

this apparatus, which is scarcely available in practice, cannot 
be given here. Suffice it to say that the apparatus, if care- 
fully calibrated, is applicable for the accurate measurement 
of the calories given off. Two similar apparatus allow of a 
simultaneous comparative examination of both arms, the one 
clothed and the other not clothed. 



4. Permeability for Rays of the Sun. 

421. Boubnoff has recently examined to what extent 
tissues transmit the sun's rays by observing the blackening 
of salts of silver covered by different tissues. He observed 
that all substances transmit the rays of the sun, those undyed 
much more than those dyed, black materials least. The per- 
meability for air has no effect on that for the rays of the 
sun, though the thickness of the material is of importance. 



APPENDIX. THERMIC PROPERTIES OF WET 
TISSUES. 

422. The above- described methods render it possible to 
examine the effects of wet tissues upon our thermic economy. 
Our feelings tell us that the efficacy of clothes as a protec- 
tion for heat is cancelled by thorough wetting, and even 
over-balanced, liubner found that an arm wrapt in moist 
flannel bandages loses by conduction and radiation as much 
heat as if completely naked, and that the total loss of heat, 
including that due to evaporation, was three times that of 
a naked arm, and five times that of one clothed. 



Although no figures are available, it may !>e assumed with certainty 
that cotton and linen tissues which are rapidly saturated by rain or 
sweat, and which when wet rapidly and totally lose their porosity, 
will behave more unfavourably than wool in experiments of measure- 
ment. At least Noclit found that a cylinder of hot water wrapped in 
wet cotton and linen tissues was cooled more strongly by about 33 per- 
cent, than if it was wrapped in wool or mixed wool. Here Lahmann's 
cotton did not behave differently from other vegetable fibres. 



DECISION ON CLOTHING. 287 



5. Bacteriological Examination. 

The investigation as to the microbia present in clothing 
materials must be effected after the careful comminution of 
a weighed and measured sample of the tissue exactly accord- 
ing to the methods for the bacteriological analysis of soils. 
In order to ascertain the property of clothing, especially 
underclothing, to take up bacteria on wearing, Hobein (Zeit. 
/ Hygiene, ix.) proceeded by fastening to the inside of under- 
clothing, close to each other, pieces of different materials in 
immediate contact with the skin, each of the size of one 
square centimetre. As was to be expected, the property 
of taking up microbia depended directly on the roughness 
and the thickness (loose texture) of the material. For par- 
ticulars see the original. 

The facts recently ascertained that pathogenic organisms 
are separated out with sweat (Br miner, Berlin klin. Wochen- 
schrift, 1891, No. 21, and Yon Eiselberg, ibidem, No. 23) 
must be kept in mind. Pathogenic organisms are more 
frequently introduced into clothing by pus, feces, gonor- 
rhoeal secretions, sputa, &c. An examination for particular 
kinds would have to be effected by staining, cultures, and 
inoculation in the known manner. 

The examination of rags is effected in the same manner. 



B. Decision on Clothing-. 

423. With the decision upon clothing, as regards its 
durability, fastness of dyes, value in comparison with price, 
&c., however important in practical life, we have here nothing 
to do, since the quality of the raw material and the method 
of production have in many cases a decisive influence, which 
can only be estimated by the technicist. 

For the recognition of artificial wool, rag-wool (shoddy, 
mungo) in woollen goods, I must refer to the work of Yon 
Hoehnel. 

I will here merely make a few remarks on the appropriate 



288 CLOTHING. 

selection of clothing, especially underclothing, for different 
climates. It must not be forgotten that some individuals 
are much more sensitive than others to unsuitable clothing, 
and that habit exerts an incredible influence. 

i. Clothing for Cold Climates. 

424. Thick materials woven loosely with many fine 
intervals in which the air is not easily movable, therefore 
by preference wool. Many strata one above the other are 
to be recommended. Furs with the hairy side turned to the 
skin afford an especially energetic protection against cold. 
The garments should fit rather tightly. 

If wool cannot be tolerated next to the skin on account of 
its great sensitiveness, soft vicuna wool affords a less irritat- 
ing substitute. As long as the wearer does not sweat, cotton 
cloth of a porous texture (reform-cotton, &c.) may do good 
service. 

2. Clothing for Hot, Dry Climates. 

325. Thin cotton or linen tissues. The garments should 
be roomy and consist of but few layers. For wear in the 
open air light- coloured garments should be used to diminish 
the absorption of heat, but with dark linings to cut off the 
excessive action of the sun's rays. 

3. Clothing for Hot, Moist Climates. 

426. Light woollen tissues which take up sweat slowly, 
but which even when thoroughly moistened are not such 
good conductors of heat us linen and cotton, since numerous 
pores still remain filled with air. If there are no consider- 
able fluctuations of temperature, porous cotton tissues, Lah- 
mann's material, &c., may be worn. 

4. Clothing for Climates with Fluctuating 
Temperature. 

| 427. As proposed under 3, but the substitution of cotton 
for woollen tissues cannot be recommended. In addition, 
overcoats which may be put on or thrown off as required. 



BIBLIOGRAPHY. 289 

5. Clothing as Protection against Rain. 

428. Caoutchouc for garments must be almost absolutely 
condemned. It is admissible only in a cold, wet climate, as 
the body underneath quickly breaks out into sweat. Porous, 
water-proof, impregnated woollen tissues have probably a 
great future. Even ordinary woollens, as compared with 
cotton, afford for a long time protection against rain ; but, 
finally, woollen garments become very heavy from the large 
quantity of water which they take up. On this account 
soldiers' cloaks have to be carried rolled up in rain and used 
as a dry nightdress.

SECTION XVII. 

SOME HINTS FOR THE HYGIENIC EXAMINATION OF 
AND DECISION UPON A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS 
ARRANGEMENT. 1 

I. Building Materials. 

429. The most important building materials in use are, 
along with quarry stones, hewn stones, and artificial stones 
(bricks, slag bricks, so-called floating bricks, cement castings, 
&c.), wood and iron. The connecting materials used are 
mortars of lime, gypsum, and cement in the widest sense of 
the word. 

i. The Stones. 

An examination of building materials is scarcely demanded 
from the hygienist ; the experience of the architect generally 
suffices to make a suitable selection. Human skill is able to 
make even less suitable material fit for use by appropriate 
application. For instance, quarry stones impervious to air 
can be utilised by means of thick connective masses of 
mortar, and by the large dimensions or by the good artificial 
ventilation of the rooms constructed. 

1 The following section shows by its title that I confine myself as far as 
possible to the most .weighty and most elementary questions in this region 
which has hitherto been so little explored hygienically. I have contented 
myself with simply indicating many points, and I have made little mention 
of the use of complicated and sparingly available apparatus. A division into 
"examination" and "decision" is mostly proposed where no especial methods 
of investigation were to be described. Some information concerning the 
locality and the soil for building are to be found in 165. In various places 
I quote as projects for imperial legislation the moderate minimum require- 
ments which the " German Association for the Care of Public Health " for- 
mulated in 1889 at its meeting in Strassburg as "Draught of Imperial 
Regulation for Insuring Healthy Dwellings," and has published in its report 
after the most thorough discussion by the most experienced authorities. 

291 



292 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS AEEANGEMENT. 

For special purposes we may occasionally determine : 

1. The volume of the pores ( 161). 

2. The permeability for air. A circumstantial experiment. We 
ascertain how much air passes through cylinders of different building 
materials of equal surface (e.g., 1 sdm.) and equal thickness (e.g., 1 dm.) 
under equal pressures. The experiments presuppose that the curved 
surface of the cylinder is made perfectly air-tight by a coat of water- 
glass, paraffine, or caoutchouc. Any accidental crevice, crack, &c., 
renders the block useless. 

3. The quantity of water which the stone can take up from moist air 
and from liquid water. The absorption from moist air is trifling, but 
from water, finely porous stones, e.g., bricks, gradually take up water 
almost to the extent of 100 per cent, of the volume of the pores. Low 
porosity is always a sign of low permeability for air. 

4. The rapidity with which water is taken up. The narrower the 
pores the slower is the absorption, but the more completely they are 
filled. 

5. The resistance of the stones and of the hardened mortar to strain 
and crushing. For this purpose very costly testing machines are 
required. The examination generally takes place in official establish- 
ments, which issue certificates to manufacturers and dealers. 1 

6. The resistance to frost. If stones after saturation with water are 
alternately fro/en (in a space cooled by means of a freezing mixture) 
and thawed again, they crack, if of inferior quality, and fragments, 
small or large, split oft' and crumble away. The method is to be left 
to the technologists. 

7. For bricks, especially if they have to serve for the 
construction of arches, &c., it is necessary to ascertain that 
they are not made from clay containing limestones. Such 
stones when the bricks are burnt become caustic lime, and 
when moistened they cause a disruption of the bricks,, as 
the quicklime is converted into calcium hydroxide with an 
increase of volume. As a test a considerable number of 
bricks are steeped in water for an hour, placed in a shaded 
place, and examined after the lapse of twenty-four hours. 
Such as contain lime are burst. White crumbs of lime are 
often seen on the surface of bricks. 



1 It is very questionable how this subject can come under the purview of 
the hygienist at all. It is the business of the architect. Editor. 



TIMBER. 293 



2. Timber. 

430. Timber may be examined for its 

a. Dryness. Recent timber contains from 30 to 60 per 
cent, of water ; air-dried, fit for building, from 20 to 25 per 
cent. ; a lower proportion than 15 per cent, is rarely found in 
perfectly air-dried wood. 

b. Firmness. No cracks must occur in the direction of the 
annual rings, but longitudinal chinks may be found. The 
exact examination takes place in the same manner as for 
stone. 

c. Soundness. Colour, gravity (not too light), resistance 
to pressure and shocks, absence of Merulius lacrymans and 
other fungi producing diseases in timber. (See 439). 

d. Botanical origin. Men of experience very readily dis- 
tinguish most kinds of timber macroscopically, and a micro- 
scopic diagnosis is possible even with small fragments. (See 
Holler's copiously illustrated article, " Nutzholzer," in Dam- 
mcr's Lexicon). 

Oak-wood is highly valued on account of its firmness, endurance of 
weather, extreme resistance to water, and relatively great security against 
fire. Resinous fir and larch-wood are highly prized 011 account of their 
great resistance to the effects of weather and moisture. Larch grown 
on mountains resists alternate moisture and dryness longer than oak, 
and is therefore preferably used for structures which lie partly above 
and partly below or close to the ground. The common pine, however, 
finds more general application on account of its low price. All 
mountain timber is preferred to that of the plains. The pitch-pine 
is not used in Germany for ordinary buildings. The red beech serves 
chiefly for floors (passages, &c.) and balustrades of stairs, and when 
impregnated for superior flooring. Ash is suitable for many purposes 
as a substitute for oak. 

e. Season of Felling. Timber felled in winter is often con- 
sidered the most valuable. If the transverse section is 
touched with iodised potassium iodide it shows a blue colour 
from the starch deposited in the medullary radiations. 
According to R. Hartig the preference for winter wood is 
unfounded.

has been artificially dried, steamed (with or without pressure), 
lixiviated (e.g., floated), does not concern us. On the other 
hand, the detection of metallic salts which have been used 
for impregnation has an interest. Burnetising (ZnS0 4 ), 
Boucherising (CuSOJ, and Kyanising (HgCl 2 ) meet with 
extensive application. In general we proceed according to 
460. Zinc and copper are found in the ash, and may be 
at once determined. Mercury may be sought for after 
destroying the wood with chlorine, according to Fresenius 
and Babo. Such impregnated timber must not be used as 
fuel for bakers, and kyanised wood should not even be em- 
ployed for dwelling-houses and stalls for cattle. 

An impregnation of wood with the heavy oils of tar 
(Bethelising) betrays itself by its odour and inflamma- 
bility. The preservative action of this process is especially 
powerful. 

On iron structures little can be said from a hygienic point 
of view. 

Within buildings they require a fire-proof coating by means of pieces 
of brick, Monier-coiistructions, c., as in serious conflagrations they 
may occasion or accelerate the collapse of the buildings. If properly 
enclosed they may be considered fire-proof, and gradually displace the 
use of wood in buildings, thus diminishing its dangers (wood diseases 
and fire). 1 



3. The Cements (Mortars). 

431. For connecting the building materials there are 
used various sorts of mortar, which will be first briefly 
described and then represented in their applications. We 
distinguish wall-mortar, which serves to connect the stones, 
and plasterers' mortar, with which they are coated over. 

1. Lime Mortar. A mixture of one part stiff lime-paste 
(slacked lime is slowly worked up with water to a stiff

uniform paste) and from three to four parts of calcareous or 
quartz-sand l of very various fineness. 

Mortar hardens in the air by loss of water and slow 
absorption of carbonic acid. 2 

The investigator seeks to ascertain : 

1. Proportion of Free Water (K. B. Lehmann and Nuss- 
baum). The authors weigh a copper boat (Fig. 124, A) in a 
weighing-tube with caoutchouc stoppers, fill the boat with the 
mortar in question, and weigh it again in the weighing-tube. 
It is preferable to undertake simultaneously a number of

determinations of different samples of mortar. The boats are 
thrust one behind another into a combustion-tube of sparingly 
fusible glass (Fig. 124, B), drawn out at one end to a beak. 
Two small gas-flames are then lighted beneath the metal 
cylinder, and the thermometer is observed. It can be easily 
kept at from 100 to 105. There is drawn through the 
combustion-tube for J to 1J hour a current of air by means 
of an aspirator which is joined on at a. The air before 
entering at ~b passes first through a Peligot-tube of the 

1 Even if the mortar contains, as, e.g., at Munich, gravel (about 50 per 
cent.), it is not sifted prior to analysis. 

2 Much mortar used in London and some other large English cities is made, 
instead of clean sharp sand, with sifted soil from fields and gardens, rich in 
decaying organic matter. The lime is slacked in large quantities, and is 
allowed to lie for a considerable time before it is used. It is needless to say 
that such mortar is not merely deficient in adhesive power, but gives off 
unpleasant and hurtful fumes. Editor.

strongest soda-lye, then a tall vessel filled with soda-pumice, 
a Peligot-tu.be with sulphuric acid, and a tall vessel with 
sulphuric pumice (see 128). All the carbonic acid and the 
water are thus removed, and the mortar is dried without 
any possible absorption of C0 2 . 

2. The proportion of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ). It is best to 
heat 100 cc. of distilled water for a few minutes to gentle ebullition in 
a flask of the capacity of 120 cc., in order to expel the carbonic aeid. 
Portions of mortar rapidly weighed (of recent mortar about 1 grm. t and 
of old mortar from 3 to 8 grin.) are dropped in, and the flask is closed 
with a caoutchouc stopper. After from 24 to 48 hours, during which 
time the cold contents of the flask are frequently shaken up, twice 25 cc. 
of the clear supernatant liquid are taken off from the undissolved matter 
and titrated with decinormal sulphuric acid after an addition of rosolic 
acid. Each cubic centimetre corresponds to 3'69 mgrm. Ca(OH) 2 . As 
100 cc. of water dissolve 1 rngrn. CaCOs, we find, strictly speaking, 
always 2'6 'nt'jrm. Ca(OH)a too much. All other methods we find much 
less practical. 

2. Cement Mortar. By cement we understand an artificial 
preparation which, in the kind most frequently met with, 
Portland cement, 1 is obtained by burning a mixture of 
natural aluminium silicates with limestone. The masses 
are well mixed, made up into bricks, and burnt to a sinter- 
ing state (i.e., incipient fusion). The finished product contains 
about GO per cent. CaO, 24 per cent. Si0 2 , 7'5 per cent. 
A1 2 3 , 3'5 per cent. Fe 2 3 , and small quantities of potassa, 
soda, and magnesia. 

On burning there are produced from aluminium silicate, iron silicate, 
and calcium carbonate, fusible calcium ferrate; there are unstable com- 
pounds of lime with silica and alumina suspended in the melt (calcium 
silicates and al animates not accurately known), whilst water and OCX 
are eliminated. If the elevated temperature is maintained too long, 
and there are formed solid crystalline compounds of the kind intimated, 
the cement loses its cohesive power. 

If properly burnt Portland cement comes in contact with water, 
there are formed calcium-hydrosilicate (CaSiOs + H. 2 0), calcium 
hydro-aluminate, and ferrate. Calcium hydroxide is set free, which 

1 I cannot here enter into the analyses of cement, the consideration of 
Roman cement (a kind less strongly burnt, poorer in lime, setting quickly, and 
chiefly suited for hydraulic work) and puzzolaue cement (a mixture of ground 
rocks, such as puzzolane, trass, c., containing silica and alumina, &c., ground 
up with caustic lime). On this subject, which as yet is not perfectly chemi- 
cally intelligible, mere indications must suffice. 



THE CEMENTS (MORTARS). 297 

gradually takes up C0 2 , and thus contributes to the solidity of the 
cement. The calcium hydroxide not combined to carbonate crystallises 
by the influence of the alkalies. 

Cement remains perfectly compact and impervious only 
whilst moist (preferably under water) ; in the air there 
always occurs a certain shrinking (minute chinks, and some- 
times the separation of entire surfaces of cement from the 
stones). Of the various causes of this phenomenon I men- 
tion only that the silica which was at first swollen afterwards 
shrinks again. A high proportion of magnesia (above 3J 
per cent.) especially deteriorates the cement. (See Chemiker 
Zeitung, xv. 1891, p. 1145). 

The several kinds of cement behave very differently as to the time 
which they require for hardening (if it takes longer than two hours the 
cement is said to set slowly), as to the proportion of sand which, may 
be added without injuring the firmness of the concrete to be formed, &c. 

We may easily ascertain the time of setting or hardening by mixing 
up small lots of cement with water. Complete hardening does not 
take place until the lapse of some days, or with many cements even 
weeks. The trial lots must be kept moist in the meantime, and a trial 
with hammer and chisel enables us to form some decision as to the 
firmness obtained. All cement factories, moreover, cause their pro- 
ducts to be officially tested, 1 and send out along with their products 
certificates of their cohesive power, firmness, and time of setting. 

For structures above the level of the water or the ground 
cements which set slowly are preferred; those which set 
quickly have often lost their cohesive power before they 
come to rest in their places. In this case they have no 
more firmness. 

Cement is of great importance in modern elevated con- 
structions for the preparation of concrete (a mixture of 
river-gravel, fragments of stone or brick, and cement). 
Wall-gypsum is also fit for use above ground. Such mix- 
tures serve very extensively for producing firm foundations, 
bedding for pavements, and massive intermediate flooring. 
In a hygienic point of view the last employment is im- 
portant ; it presents great advantages for cellar stories, 
upper and basement kitchens, sculleries, baths, and closets, 

1 This refers, of course, to Germany. Editor. 



298 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

as compared with floorings on wooden beams, which in such 
positions are very objectionable. It has an advantage over 
arches, as affording a horizontal floor without demanding 
great height. 

3. Mixed Mortars of Quicklime, Cement, and Gypsum. 
For improving lime-mortar, that is, for amending, harden- 
ing, and for making it more quickly cohesive, so as to 
expedite work, additions of cement or gypsum are often 
used. 

For tliis purpose only cements which set slowly can be employed, as 
others already lose their cohesive power before the mortar is used, and 
then they injure instead of improving the firmness of the mass. But 
the behaviour of the different cements is dissimilar, and an experiment 
is required before they are used. 

Besides the frequent addition of gypsum as plaster for inside walls, 
it is also used in many places (e.g., the Southern Harz) for plastering 
outer walls. This mass, known as " wall-gypsum," sets more slowly 
than modellers' gypsum ; it is weather-proof and attains great firmness, 
both which points are proved by buildings erected in the middle ages. 
This gypsum has a coarser grain than modellers' gypsum ; it is burnt 
differently, up to a red heat, and does not expand on setting (see 
Feichtinger.) 



II. Plan of the Building. 

432. In drawing up the sketch of ground-plan it is in 
the first place important to carry out the programme of the 
owner at the least expenditure, and further to utilise the 
plot of ground at disposal in the most advantageous manner, 
effecting a distribution and arrangement of the rooms suitable 
in every respect. 

The hygienic demands on the plans for building are not 
yet universally recognised, and are not, indeed, sufficiently 
established to expect full recognition. The most important 
of these requirements are : 

1. The staircase, the kitchen, and offices should be placed 
at the shady sides, if any (or at the least favourable side of 
the plot as regards air, light, and insolation), so that the 
sunny or more favourable aspects may be fully and entirely 
reserved for the rooms which serve for prolonged occupation. 



PLAN OF THE BUILDING. 299 

2. The rooms in which malodorous gases and vapours are 
produced (kitchen, wash-house, bath, and closet) should not 
be in the direction exposed to the local winds, as otherwise 
the air from them will be conveyed through the dwelling- 
and sleeping-rooms. 

3. For summer ventilation it is necessary to arrange the 
rooms so as to provide them with window and door open- 
ings in such a manner that a through current may be pro- 
ducible in all rooms, as otherwise on calm sultry days a 
sufficient aeration is not attainable. This condition is of 
great value for cooling the rooms in the evening. 

4. All rooms intended for prolonged occupation must have 
their windows on the sides which receive sufficient light, air, 
and sun. 

5. All other rooms (ante-chambers, hall, bath, W.C.) 
should at least be sufficiently supplied with indirect light, 
and thorough ventilation for them must be secured. 

By a proper arrangement of the staircase a tolerable 
illumination and sufficient ventilation may be provided for 
the ante-chambers, if these have no window leading into 
the open air. In every such room there is placed a window 
(with an iron grating against burglars) opening to the stair- 
case, whilst the latter has, near its ceiling, ventilating 
apertures which can be easily regulated with a chain and 
catch (lattice- traps, tilting-boards, &c.). 

6. The number and position of the staircases must be such 
that in danger of fire they can be quickly and easily reached 
from all parts of the house. For further security it is neces- 
sary that the ante-chamber, hall, house, and court doors must 
open outwards, and that every dwelling-room has a direct 
exit to the hall or the staircase. 

The proposed Imperial law makes the extremely moderate 
demands that 

The height of a building towards the street must not be greater than 
the distance to the opposite line of buildings. 

1. The greatest permissible height of the walls of the building facing 
the court, and provided with the windows prescribed in 7, is 1 ^ time 
the mean distance from the opposite boundary of the vacant space. 



3 co A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

2. The mean width of a court upon which windows open must not 
be less than 4 m. 

3. A joining together of adjacent plots of land in order to obtain the 
prescribed distance, or the prescribed minimum width, is permissible as 
long as it is guaranteed that the courts shall not be built upon. 

4. Every part of a ground-plot which is not built upon must be pro- 
vided with an access for the sake of cleansing at least 1 m. in width and 
2 m. in height. 

5. On building lots which are already occupied with loftier or more 
crowded buildings than the stipulations of 2 admit, the following re- 
gulations come into force in case of new structures : 

The height of a building to the street may be l- time the distance 
to the opposite line of buildings, and towards the court three times the 
width of the court. 

The width of the court may be reduced to 2*50 m. 

6. In applying this determination no deterioration of the conditions 
of light and air formerly existing must be in any case occasioned. 

A new structure is permissible only if care is taken for the sufficient 
supply of wholesome drinking-water, and for the removal of refuse and 
waste matter in a manner not injurious to health. 



III. Examination of and Decision on a 
House when completed. 

I. Stability and Durability. 

433. 1. Thickness of the walls. Walls built solid, if 
loaded, must be at least from 25 to 30 cm. in thickness. If 
such walls are higher than 10 m., they must up to that height 
be thicker by at least 12 to 15 cm. 

All loaded walls must be connected together in each story 
by means of beams or of iron bearers, so that no bulging out- 
wardly may occur ; this is especially to be kept in mind 
where the thrust of an arch or any similar action may come 
into play. The stability of a wall depends indeed as much 
on the firmness of the materials employed (stones and mortar), 
and the goodness of the workmanship, as on its thickness. 
All the joinings must be perpendicular or horizontal, and be 
everywhere of equal width, if bricks are used. 

2. Defects in consequence of bad workmanship or of in- 
sufficient thickness show themselves by fissures and cracks. 
If they are short and very narrow no danger is to be appre- 



CELLAES AND CELLAR-DWELLINGS. 301 

bended ; I5ut if they extend through entire stories or through 
several stories, or if they are wide (4 mm. and upwards), a 
thorough investigation by experts is required, or a repair or 
rebuilding of the parts endangered. If such defects appear 
before the completion of the structure, it must be con- 
sidered that the loading will be very considerably increased 
with use. 

3. If the building-ground or the foundations were bad, or 
if the intermediate floors were not strong enough, or if in 
inhabited houses they have been weakened by timber diseases, 
this is shown by subsidence. This defect is perceived partly 
by chinks and crevices, partly by the settling of parts 
which are heavily burdened (such as near stoves, hearths, 
safes), but especially by the circumstance that the locks of 
doors no longer fit, doors and windows gape or become 
wedged up, or the floors no longer lie horizontally. 

2. Cellars and Cellar-Dwellings. 

434. An ideal cellar should have a uniform low tem- 
perature (from 5 to 15) ; it should be dry, and be secure 
from ground-water and ground-air. In practice these re- 
quirements cannot in general be perfectly combined. 

Care must be taken that the moisture which is thus 
naturally precipitated on the cold walls of the cellar may be 
diminished by powerful airing (ventilation) in the cooler 
season (autumn), but not augmented by the inrush of the 
moisture of the soil or by ground- water. 

As in the construction of cellars the porosity of the 
masonry is of no importance, and the hardening of moist or 
wet lime-mortar proceeds very slowly, cement-mortar alone 
is to be recommended for underground structures, and thus 
forms a complete protection against water oozing in from the 
sides. 

The floor of the cellar is preferably laid with cement upon 
a substratum of concrete. But if it does not lie above the 
highest level of the ground-water, the entrance of the latter 
can scarcely be prevented even with the best cemented 



302 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

masonry, and such a structure must be pronounced a total 
failure. 

Warm cellars preserve articles of food badly; potatoes 
sprout, beer and wine are exposed to decompositions ; damp 
cellars promote mouldiness of the articles stored in them. 

435. In general we attempt to prevent the ascent of 
moisture in the cellar- walls by isolating materials : plates of 
lead, asphalt, glass, tarred paste-board or cement, in the 
entire walls as high as the floor of the ground-story. 

Sometimes water-proof layers are inserted in the foundation walls, 
upon which the cellar-walls are erected, below the level of the cellar- 
flooring. Sometimes the entire cellar-wall is outwardly coated with 
cement, arrangements all of which deserve to he recommended. 

Determinations of the carbonic acid show if the ground- 
air has been properly excluded. As the ground-air contains 
several per cents, of carbonic acid, whilst the open air has 
only from O3 to 0'4 per thousand, a strong influx of carbonic 
acid is in general easy to recognise. Uffelmann detected in 
a cellar with a very porous flooring always from 1 to 5 '7 per 
thousand of carbonic acid. 

Since the ground-air has been found to be free from 
microbia, its systematic exclusion has no longer quite the 
same importance as formerly, when it was dreaded as the 
introducer of disease-germs. Still, its high proportion of car- 
bonic acid, its moisture and its odour often bad are reasons 
enough for excluding it from the cellar as far as practicable. 

It is vc-ry judicious to exclude the cellar-air (which is always damp 
and more or less malodorous) from the house l>y laying an air-tight 
stratum of asphalt over the ceiling of the cellar, and causing the cellar- 
stairs to open direct into the court close to the hack-door of the house. 
A penthouse with lateral screens in case of need covers both doors, and 
protects any one going into the cellar against had weather. This may 
be especially recommended if washing is done in the cellar, as if the 
cellar-stairs open within the house the rooms are filled with watery 
vapour and the smell of suds. A disadvantage lies in the insecurity 
against robbery. 

436. Cellar-dwellings must be pronounced anti-sanitary, 
as they are always damp. For their disadvantages see 



ROOFS AND ROOF-DWELLINGS. 303 

438, and Betke (Bibliography). The proposed Imperial 
law demands that- 
The floor of all dwelling-rooms (to be erected in future) must lie 
above the highest level of the ground-water, and in regions liable to 
floods above high-water mark. 

The floors and walls of all rooms serving for the prolonged abode of 
man must be secured against ground-moisture. 

Dwellings in cellars, i.e., in stories the flooring of which lies below 
the surface of the ground, are not permissible. 

Rooms serving for the prolonged stay of human beings, especially 
single rooms, may be constructed only on condition that the floor is 
at most 1 m. below, and the opening of the window at least 1 m. 
above, the surface of the earth. Relief from these conditions is per- 
missible if the industrial utilisation of the space requires a deeper 
situation. 

Cellar-dwellings may be made tolerable by deep air-shafts 
carried outside along the cellar-walls, and if they are pro- 
vided we may judge more leniently. In this case a porous 
wall-dressing must be used. 1 

3. Roofs and Roof-Dwellings. 

437. The space under the roof (garrets, attics, mansarde- 
rooms) must always be dry, airy, protected against dust and 
soot, and their temperature must not fluctuate too extremely. 

Eoof-dwellings demonstrably present conditions very un- 
favourable to health, in consequence of their very unsatis- 
factory thermic relations. It is hence imperative that the 
roof in inhabited rooms must receive thermic protection by 
means of quiescent strata of air, and by lining the inner side 
of the walls with materials which are poor conductors of 
heat. The examination is conducted in a manner which is 
at once apparent. In towns where the air is much polluted 
by soot the demands of free aeration, and of the exclusion of 
soot, cannot well be simultaneously satisfied. 

The most important materials for roofing are at present 
tiles, slates, sheet-metal, cemented wood, and roofing-paper. 

1 Cellar-dwellings are still too common in England, the only large town 
where they are (or were lately) entirely absent being Sheffield. In this point 
the sanitary condition of Paris is much superior to that of London. Editor. 



304 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

Eoofs of straw, reeds, and shingles are disappearing more 
and more on account of the danger of fire. 

A tile-roof, the joints of which are carefully coated with some 
weather-proof material, presents the advantages of a good ventilation 
through its pores, tolerable thermic conditions, and moderate expense. 
It excludes dust and soot. This is not effected by the more airy tile- 
roofs with joints not coated, nor by slate-roofs on laths. 

If a slate-roof lies on a wooden support covered with roofing-paper, 
the nuisance of dust and soot is entirely at an end, but the ventilation 
becomes very slight. In this case care must be taken for the ventila- 
tion of the wood-work of the roof, or it may quickly fall to ruin. 

The latter defect pertains in a still higher degree to sheet-metal 
roofs, which must be considered hygienically objectionable on account 
of their unfavourable thermic properties. 

If the attic story contains rooms for permanent occupation, roofing 
with wood and cement is greatly to be recommended, as it affords ex- 
tremely favourable thermic conditions at a moderate cost. At the same 
time, it has the advantage that the rooms have nearly horizontal ceilings, 
whilst the fiat roof can serve as a resort in the evening after sultry days 
whilst, the rooms are still heated. 

A roof of roofing-paper takes a very subordinate place for dwelling- 
rooms, but it is very extensively used for factories, barracks, &c. It 
also requires ventilation of the beam-work, and whitewashing as a 
protection against heat. 

In all air-tight kinds of roofing the ventilation is to be 
considered as necessary if it has below a wooden lining or a 
coating of mortar. If the air can play round the beams 
below, the occasional aeration of the rooms in question is 
sufficient for the preservation of the woodwork. 



4. The Walls. 

438. 1. Dampness of the Walls. For accurate examina- 
tion (after removing in case of need a piece of the paper- 
hangings) we bore a hole with a steel gauge-chisel through 
the entire thickness of the wall-plaster, if possible over a 
joint of the mortar. AVe collect the mortar in a glass with 
a caoutchouc stopper : we then bore deeper into the mortar 
at a joint (to about 5 cm.}, and collect this also in a separate 
glass. We then effect in each specimen a determination of 
the water and quicklime, according to 431. For an 
accurate decision we should take specimens of the plastering 



THE WALLS. 305 

and the wall-mortar at different parts of the room, two at 
least. There are hitherto no methods for this purpose which 
do not injure the paper-hangings. Hygrometric examinations 
of the air yield very uncertain results. The sound of the 
mortar on tapping, the touch on feeling it, and ocular in- 
spection are all but doubtful auxiliaries, thus, e.g., a cold wall 
always feels moister than one which is warm. 

If it is required to determine the source of the water, 
attention must be given to the fact that 

1. The house has been damp from the beginning. 

2. The house was only superficially dry when first occupied ; the 
places which are now remarkably damp are to be referred to the con- 
densation on the cold walls of gaseous water as it is exhaled by the 
inmates, and by every particle of linen hung up to dry. This case may 
be observed every winter in many cellar dwellings. 

3. Condensed water on cisterns of cold water (sweat- water, as called 
by masons) may render the rooms damp in which the cistern is placed. 

4. The water may be derived from leaky pipes, or from defective 
roofing, or, in time of rain, from windows which do not fit tightly. 

5. The walls on the weather-side may be so thin that they allow 
rain, which beats against them, to penetrate, and they are not pro- 
tected with a coating of slates, shingles, or roofing-tiles. 

6. The moisture is ascending ground-water. This case is the most' 
unfavourable ; it shows that the foundation-walls extend into the 
ground-water, or into wet strata of earth, without the introduction of 
materials impervious to water. A remedy is here difficult. 

For deciding these questions no particular methods are 
required, merely a careful examination and a consideration 
of all the conditions. 

As soon as extensive damp spots are observed in several 
places, and perhaps water oozing down, and vegetations of 
mould upon paper-hangings, articles of leather, &c., and 
suitable measures l do not at once remove the mischief, the 
house must at once be considered as dangerous to health. 

Articles of food (bread, meat, &c.) become mouldy in a 
damp atmosphere much more readily than in dry air. 

Good dry walls contain not more than from 04 to O6 per 

1 The presence of calcium chloride and nitrate in the mortar promotes 
renewed dampness, as these salts are very hygroscopic. They are introduced 
by the use of water containing chlorides and nitrates, or by the infiltration of 
sewage into the building, from which it cannot again be removed. 

VOL. II. U 



306 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

cent, of free water. New buildings, according to K. B. Leh- 
mann and Nussbaum, may be regarded as dry if the entire 
mortar does not contain more than 1 per cent, of water. 

If the moisture reaches 4 or 5 per cent, it is perceptible 
to our feeling. 

At what proportion of moisture hygiene should sanction 
the occupation of a newly-built house can only be determined 
by the aid of further data. For the present, 1 per cent, may 
be regarded as a limit to be aimed at. In any case, in a 
house with rational arrangements for heating and ventilation 
and with the guarantee that these are used we may be 
rather more lenient. I consider 1-5 to, at the outside, 2 per 
cent, the utmost limit. 

It cannot be denied that houses with proportions of moisture 
evidently not inconsiderably higher are taken into occupation. The 
unpleasantness and the danger to health of drying a house by living in 
it are universally known. Firstly, damp walls are good conductors of 
heat in winter, and are therefore cold (danger of taking cold) ; secondly, 
a quantity of water in the walls is a preliminary condition for a growth 
of micro-organisms in or upon them ; and, lastly, the presence of water 
in paper-hangings renders possible a development in them of arseniu- 
retted hydrogen. Infectious diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, are frequent 
in damp houses, and articular rheumatism and chronic diseases of the 
kidney demand numerous sacrifices, though we have not yet reached a 
clear understanding of the connection. 

Authors have also, certainly, expressed an opposite opinion. 
Edlefsen cannot recognise any connection between articular 
rheumatism and damp dwellings, although this disease ap- 
pears strikingly accumulated in many houses (Fourth 
Congress for Internat. Med. in 1885). Hiillman (Deutsche 
Viertcljalirsclirift fur offcn. Gesundlieitspfleye, 1885) finds 
the occupation of damp newly- built houses quite harmless 
if there is sufficient ventilation, with the addition of an 
aspect open to the wind, and he supports this opinion with 
rather copious statistics. Notwithstanding these results, the 
greatest caution appears to me to be for the present our 
duty. 

439. 2. The best known and most dreaded disease of 
timber is caused by the house-fungus (Merulius lacrymans). 



THE WALLS. 307 

It is developed chiefly in damp wood excluded from air, e.g., 
on the under side of flooring-boards which lie upon moist 
earth without an isolating stratum of air, on beam-heads 
built into walls, &c. 

In our forests the house-fungus very rarely occurs, it is 
almost always introduced from other structures (wood from 
infected buildings, the shoes and tools of the workmen, wood 
from infected sheds, &c.). 

House-fungus is recognised by its mycelium, which in its 
earliest stages forms whitish, woolly, cobweb-like flocks, but 
afterwards forms thicker layers, lines, or cords of a whitish- 
grey, afterwards ash-grey colour and strong lustre. (For 
the microscopic peculiarities of the mycelium, see Hartig.) 
Under favourable conditions the fungus grows with enorm- 
ous rapidity grows over or through stone and ironwork by 
means of long tough extended lines, and forms ultimately, 
where the mycelium arrives at daylight, flat, expanded, 
leathery, plate or console- shaped fruit-bearers of a yellowish- 
brownish or brownish-red colour, from 5 to 30 cm. in 
diameter, supporting a dark brown layer of fruit. The 
latter displays wide wavy pores of an irregular shape, and 
emits clear drops ; the spores, which fall out in masses, are 
of a cinnamon-brown, oval, bicellular. 

House-fungus sometimes betrays itself before it comes 
visibly to light by the damp smell of the rooms (the putre- 
fying fruits emit a very offensive smell), by the sinking in 
of parts of the floor which are heavily burdened (near the 
stove), and by the cessation of vibration. The last symptoms 
are due to the circumstance that the wood loses a large part 
of its mineral constituents, of its cellulose and its coniferine, 
and therewith forfeits its elasticity and firmness. The wood 
loses as much as a quarter of its bulk and the half of its 
weight, and in a dry state it becomes friable. At the same 
time its power of absorbing water increases threefold. 

Hartig has recently shown that, along with Merulius 
lacrymans, other fungi (e.g., Polyporus vaporarius) effect the 
destruction of wood most rapidly, attacking it even in the 
forest. 



3 o8 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

Polyporus vaporarius forms a snow-white mycelium which 
does not turn grey even with age, and scarcely apparent 
white fruits with small pores. It attacks only moist wood, 
as its cords have not the power of transferring water from 
damp to dry parts of a house. 

A disease of wood known as " red stripiness " destroys 
timber without any externally visible mycelium. In its 
highest degrees it is known as dry rot. We speak also of 
a " suffocation " of timber. We now know these affec- 
tions also are determined by pileate fungi; and Polyporus 
vaporarius, as well as the true house-fungus, may be the 
cause. Other fungi which behave in a similar manner have 
not been as yet sufficiently investigated. The more de- 
veloped diseases of timber in a house must be judged very 
severely. The safety and the agreeableness of the dwelling 
suffer very considerably; remedies are difficult and costly, 
<md there is always danger that the house may become 
totally useless. Fungi are further a sign of deficient dry- 
ness of the rooms ; indeed, rooms which were previously 
dry may be made damp again by house-fungus. 

Besides the indirect injuries, Ungefug alleges (Viertdjahr- 
sclirift fur ycr. MecL, vol. xxvii., &c., Bibliography) that he 
has observed attacks of disease in a family who lived in a 
house very strongly attacked with fungus. The symptoms 
were not characteristic, fever, constipation, catarrh of the 
respiratory organs; spores were abundant in the sputum. 
For the present the connection between the illness and the 
fungus seems to me by no means free from doubt, such 
affections would otherwise be observed more frequently. 
The presence of spores in the sputum is not necessarily 
connected with any hurtfulness of the spores.

440. 3. Wall-colours and Paper-hangings. The coating 
of the walls deserve our attention on several grounds. 



FLOORS AND CEILINGS. 309 

Whilst lime-colours scarcely interfere with the porosity of 
the walls, and consequently with ventilation through the 
pores, size-colours, paper-hangings, and oil paints are in an 
ascending series hindrances to the exchange of air and the 
transfer of water. Walls coated with plates of stone, or 
imitations of stone, leather-hangings, &c., exclude the air 
almost absolutely. For an accurate determination of the 
ventilation through the pores we proceed in any given case 
as in 117. Wainscoting of wood is now always applied 
so as to be at a distance of from 3 to 5 cm. from the wall, 
and affords apertures at top and bottom for the change of 
air ; otherwise it warps, splits, &c. In this state it does not 
at all interfere with the interchange of air. 

For paper-hangings the search for arsenic is often very 
important (see Section XVIII.). 

Esmarch undertakes a bacteriological examination of walls by 
rubbing a surface of 25 scm. with a piece of fine sponge about the 
size of a bean, previously sterilised by boiling in water. The sponge 
with the adhering fungi is then worked up to a roller-plate. For the 
application of this method to comparative enumeration, see the original 
(Zdtsch. f. Hygiene, vol. ii.). The presence of caustic lime in the walls 
certainly prevents any development of microbia for a very long time. 
Washing with lime-water destroys all. 

For the detection of the bacilli of tubercle, collected dust or scrapings 
of the plaster, or the washings of paper-hangings, &c., are introduced 
into the peritoneal cavity of guinea-pigs ( 75). See Cornet (Zeit. f. 
Hygiene, v.), "The Distribution of the Bacilli of Tubercle outside of 
the Body." 

5. Floors and Ceilings. 

441. Floors should be smooth, not splintery, lasting, and, 
above all, well joined, so as completely to shut off the false 
bottom. 

Different woods are suitable for floors in the following 
decreasing order : oak, impregnated red beech, white beech, 
ash, American pitch pine, Scotch fir, pine. The boards 
should be dove-tailed to each other, and either be laid in 
asphalt or lined below with impervious roofing-paper. 

Beneath the flooring there follows in " parquet " and 



3 io A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

" band " floors l a dead floor constructed of ordinary but 
sound planks ; the space between the latter and the plank of 
the ceiling of the room below is filled in its upper half with 
some porous material, a bad conductor of heat and sound, 
and as safe as possible in case of fire ; the lower half is left 
void. 

It is important to ascertain what material has been used 
for the false flooring. Along with the above-mentioned 
properties such flooring must be free from damp, from 
nutritive media, from inferior organisms, and from unappe- 
tising or disgusting materials. 2 

Instead of washed, dry sand and gravel, dry clean building rubbish, 
and other indifferent materials, Emmerich discovered the nse of 
incredibly filthy matter. The examination is conducted like that of 
soils ( 157), the most interesting points to be determined being 
chlorine, nitric acid, nitrous acid, and ammonia. The mouldy, putres- 
cent smell of such materials, and even of entire dwellings where it 
has been used, puts us on the track. An examination of the rubbish 
taken out will generally render an analysis superfluous. 

Emmerich was also able to detect considerable increases of tempera- 
lure in the dirty matter filled in between the floor and the ceiling. 
Such increases are due to the vital processes of micro-organisms, and 
are detected by the introduction of thermometers. He further detected 
the increase of carbonic acid in the air of uninhabited rooms, and lastly 
(Arclt.f. ][iiyien<', vol. ii.), by the culture Friedlander's coccus of pneu- 
monia from the false floor of a hall in a prison during an epidemic of 
pneumonia. Heinzelmann repeatedly detected the bacilli of tetanus 
in false floors at Munich. The examination scarcely requires special 
methods ; for the details we may refer to the works cited. More par- 
ticular instructions as to how a material for false bottoms is tested as to 
its hygienic properties, and also as to the deadening of sound, may be 
found in Nussliauin (ArcJi.f. Hygiene, v.). 

The decision upon any impurities detected in a false 
bottom must, according to what has been said, be abso- 
lutely strict. Polluted material is at once repulsive and 
hurtful to health, and must be replaced by clean substances. 

For a decision on odours see sewer gases.

Ventilation (of the beam-heads) is necessary for the tim- 
bers if they are not to fall to early destruction. In this 
respect panel work has advantages. 

6. Windows and Doors. 

442. Windows and doors must close well, and the 
former should always admit of opening. It is very judicious 
to provide them with a trap arrangement (capable of revolv- 
ing on a horizontal axle). Double windows are a protection 
-against the cold in winter, and to some extent against heat 
in summer. They are also a security against dust and the 
noise of the streets. For simple windows double glazing 
{the two panes placed at an interval of 7 cm.) from each 
other afford a similar protection. 

Except at the northern sides shutters or lattices outside 
the glass windows are necessary to exclude the summer sun. 1 
Interrupted shutters with louvre boards are now generally 
used, which render it possible to keep the rooms cool, though 
.at the expense of the light. All curtains, blinds, &c., inside 
the windows serve merely as a protection against light ; as a 
security against cold their action is very imperfect.

443. Rooms for prolonged occupation should, according 
to the proposed imperial law, have a window-surface = ^ of 
the surface of the floor. 

For schools one-fifth is generally demanded; Tischler 
-considers one-seventh sufficient for village schools as a 
moderate demand. In schools, offices, &c., the light should 
enter only from the left, though a slight simultaneous 
illumination from the right does little harm. If light is 
introduced from the front it dazzles the pupils, and if from 
behind the teacher. The depth of the rooms, and the more

312 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

or less free position of the house, come here prominently 
into consideration. In the upper rooms smaller windows 
suffice than in the lower. The position of the house with 
respect to the cardinal points is important. In a northern 
aspect the diffused light can be fully utilised. In the other 
directions curtains are required, which should be thin and 
of a light colour by preference white or pale grey. 

For private houses the darkening action of thick curtains must be 
taken into account, as they especially screen the upper part of the 
window, which is optically the most valuable. All decorative curtains 
should be placed as far as possible in front of the wall, and not of the 
surface of the window. The colour of the ceiling, of the walls, of the 
door, of the stove, and of the furniture is important ; a light colour 
for the walls, which reflects light well, is especially desirable for north 
rooms if they are intended for work. 

For an objective decision on the amount of illumination with day- 
light of a given spot, L. Weber has devised his room-goniometer. See 
Dinyler's Polyt. Jonrtud, vol. cclix. p. 122. A short description with a 
figure is found in Uffelmann's Handbuch der Hygiene, p. 26. Fifty square 
degrees on a dull day = about 10 metre-candles (see 447). 

Weber's photometer, to be described below, may be used 
for measurements of daylight ( 447X

in the bibliography of the section on air. 1 This especially 
refers to the quantitative determination of carbon monoxide 
(see 134), which is hygienically the most important con- 
stituent of coal-gas. Such gas, how brilliant soever may be 
the illumination it produces, is bad hygienically if its pro- 
portion of carbon monoxide exceeds from 5 to 7 per cent. 
Unfortunately proportions of 10 per cent, are often found. 
"Water-gas" with about 30 per cent, of CO is absolutely 
inadmissible for private houses ; in manufactories and 
smelting-works, where there are better guarantees for well- 
fitting piping, and for circumspection in the use of so- 
dangerous a compound, it may be used, but with caution. 2 
In comparison with carbon monoxide the toxicity of all the 
other ingredients of coal-gas entirely vanishes. Sulphuretted 
hydrogen ought to be absent, as it burns to sulphurous acid. 
Carbon disulphide, and more complicated organic compounds 
of sulphur, should be present only in the minutest possible 
traces. An examination of the gases escaping from a burner 
which has " struck back " readily shows, on applying lead 
paper, sulphur in organic combinations, which is thus con- 
verted into H 2 S (Chem. Zeit. Repertorium, 1891, p. 6). For 
the luminous power the proportion of benzene is especially 
important, along with it ethylene, propylene, and butylene, 
the heavy hydrocarbons. 

The odoriferous constituents of coal-gas (acetylene, the 
higher hydrocarbons, such as naphthaline, organic sulphur 
compounds) betray the danger of poisoning by carbon mon- 
oxide only when the escape passes free into the air. If a 
street main is broken the soil at first absorbs the odoriferous 
substances perfectly, but subsequent portions passing through 
the same soil give off a peculiar aromatic odour, and not until 
the absorbent power of the earth is exhausted does the true 
smell of coal-gas make its appearance. In winter especially 



1 The examination by means of Bunte's burette is sufficient for most pur- 
poses, and is well and fully described by Leybold (Journal f. Gasbeleuchtuny, 
1890, p. 233). 

2 It is not sufficiently known that by a simple process invented by the 
editor the carbon monoxide may be completely removed from water-gas. 



3 i4 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

coal-gas may diffuse itself 30 m. and more in the soil from 
a ruptured pipe, and into heated houses, which often may 
themselves not have any gas piping laid in. If the escape 
of gas is not perceptible to the smell, CO may be de- 
tected by the methods given in 134. Or some white 
mice may be placed in a cage in the locality to be examined, 
and if they die their blood may be examined for carbon 
monoxide. 

It may be very important to seek out defective places in 
gas-piping ; this is done by approaching them with a candle, 
and thus rendering any escaping gas visible by ignition. For 
this purpose the light must not be too strong, and as a 
matter of course in a room into which gas has already 
escaped in quantity, such investigations can only be under- 
taken after a thorough ventilation on account of the risk of 
explosion and of poisoning. If a gas-pipe has burst under- 
ground, the search for the faulty part by digging down and 
trying with a light is often difficult and depending on acci- 
dent. Coal-gas explodes violently if mixed with from five 
to eight parts of air. Hollow rods are thrust down in the 
direction of the gas-pipe at distances of from 1 to 3 m. ; the 
gas issues from the rods near the damaged place, and is 
recognised by its odour and by ignition. 

Gas-burners may often be judged by the eye without any 
testing. In those of improved construction the heating and 
contamination of the air and the expense decrease pari passu 
with the increasing utilisation of the luminous power. 

The slit-burners are to be regarded as quite injudicious: 
very similar are the fish-tail burners ; much better are the 
Argand burners, provided with many line apertures for the 
escape of the gas. Here a much higher temperature of the 
flame and a greater luminosity are secured by a lamp 
cylinder. Very much preferable arc the recently devised 
systems in which both the coal-gas and the air supplied 
arc warmed previously (regenerative, intensive burners, &c.). 
See 447. 



ARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION. 315 

PETROLEUM. 

445. American petroleum in its crude state l consists of 
a mixture of very numerous hydrocarbons, chiefly of the 
formula C n H 2n+2 , i.e., belonging to the marsh-gas series. 2 By 
fractionated distillation the mixture is resolved into petro- 
leum ether (boils at from 40 to 70), gasoline (70 to 80), 
petroleum naphtha C == petroleum benzine (80 to 100), 
petroleum naphtha B = ligroin (100 to 120), petroleum 
naphtha A (120 to 150), then in petroleum distilling from 
140 to 150, and up to 300, and lastly, heavy oils, lubricat- 
ing oils boiling above 300. 

According to Thorner, a petroleum containing more than 
6 per cent, of oil distilling below 140 is to be objected to as 
dangerous. If it contains more than 8 per cent, of substances 
volatile above 310 its luminous power is decreased in an 
undue manner. 

In Germany an Imperial law of February 24, 1882, pre- 
scribes that petroleum which, at a barometric pressure of 
760 mm., gives off inflammable vapours at a temperature 
below 21, may be sold only with special precautions, and 
must be labelled as dangerous. 

For determining the flashing-point of the vapours, the 
employment of Abel's petroleum-tester is obligatory. Since 
each instrument is accompanied with a full description, with 
illustration and tables, the following general remarks may 
suffice : 

The petroleum, refrigerated before the experiment down to 12, is 
introduced into a brass cylinder up to a mark. It is suspended about 
half full in an air-bath, which is heated by a surrounding water-bath. 
The latter is filled at first with warm water at 58, and kept at 55 
during the experiment by means of a spirit-flame. The petroleum 
vessel closes with a lid ; a spring which is drawn up each time on 
pressing a button permits the following action. A slide in the lid of 

1 Various important matters on the purification of petroleum, apparatus for 
testing, &c., may be found in a paper by Kissling (Chemiker Zeitung, 1890, 
No. 68). 

- Hydrocarbons of the ethylene, naphthene, and benzene series may also be 
found in small quantities. Caucasian petroleum behaves quite differently. 



3i6 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS AKRANGEMENT. 

the brass cylinder opens for two seconds, and at the same time the- 
flame of a very small lamp burning on the lid lowers itself into the 
internal space of the petroleum vessel. As soon as the vapours have 
reached a certain density there appears a bluish flame of short duration. 

We begin testing at lower or higher temperatures, according to the 
barometric pressure (e.g., at from 715 to 725 mm. at 15'5, at 745 to 755 
at 16'5 C ), as the development of vapour is promoted by a low baro- 
metric pressure. As soon as the thermometer has risen ^ the experi- 
ment is repeated until a distinct blue flame flashes up. 

The temperature of ignition thus is re-calculated for the normal 
height of the barometer, 760 mm. The following figures are a brief 
extract from the table which accompanies the instrument.

Consequently, if a petroleum flashes at 730 mm. of the barometer, at 
19'0, its flashing-point for the normal barometric level of 760 mm. is 
at 201). 

Petroleum, which does not meet the very moderate German 
requirements, is scarcely met with in trade, but according to 
Eisner there are often good and cheap sorts of petroleum 
with a flashing-point of 40 Abel. The "Kaiserol" (impe- 
rial oil) in such general use gives an Abel test of 42. The 
hygienist will rarely use the instrument. 

The hygienic decision on the construction of lamps has 
to consider that round burners generally give a more con- 
venient illumination than fiat burners ( 447j, though there 
are recent Hat 1 turners of very judicious construction and 
very considerable illuminating power, so that a direct exami- 
nation according to the principles laid down in 447 cannot 
be dispensed with. A danger of explosion scarcely exists 
with the more recent construction of lamps and the judicious 
use of superior qualities of petroleum, as the latter are in 
general even much less inflammable than the law requires. 

The vacuum formed in the oil-holder by the consumption of the 
petroleum becomes gradually filled with petroleum vapour and air. 
Explosive mixtures can be formed only under two conditions : 



ARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION. 317 

1. The petroleum lias been badly purified, so that it emits explosive 
vapours without being strongly heated. 

2. Conditions occur in which the vapours produced are abnormally 
heated : 

a. Another burning lamp is placed below the oil-holder of a burning 

suspended lamp. 

&. By occlusion of the air-holes in the perforated gallery of the brass 
cylinder, so that the upper parts of the burner are imperfectly 
cooled. 

c. Particles of wick which, when the lamp has been carelessly 
trimmed previously, have fallen upon the plate of the burner- 
tube (the transverse closing of the inner free space of the 
burner-socket of an annular burner), and have become ignited 
so as to heat the petroleum-holder. 

But for these explosive vapours really to explode, air rich in oxygen 
must be mixed with them, which cannot readily occur without the 
oxygen being first consumed, except in wide burner-sockets not suffi- 
ciently filled by the wick. A defective nature of the wick is therefore 
.a main cause of explosions. 

The petroleum vapours are less frequently ignited when, 011 carrying 
the lamp, the hot upper oil-receiver comes suddenly in contact with 
the cold petroleum and breaks. 



2. EXAMINATION OF AND DECISION ON THE 
QUANTITY OF LIGHT FURNISHED. 1 

446. We express the luminous power (strength of light) 
of any given source of light by comparing it with the 
" normal candle," which is taken as a unit. 

Unfortunately the most different sources of light are still used as 
normal candles. Those best known in Germany are : 

The German Union paraffine candle 2 consumes, when the flame is 
50 mm. in height, 7 '7 grm. paraffine (congelation-point, 55) per hour, 
and yields an intensity of light 1-224 (weight of a candle, 50 grm.). 

The Munich stearine candle consumes, for a flame 50 mm. in height, 
from 10'2 to 12 grm. stearine, and yields a light of the intensity of 
1135. 

The amyl-acetate lamp of Von Hefner Alteneck yields, for a flame 
40 mm. in height, a light of the intensity of 100. It is considered the 
most constant source of light. See the critical researches of Lowen- 
herz and Drehschmidt (Journal f. Gasbeleuchtung, 1891, No. 34). A 



1 On the "illuminative power of lamp-shades" see the thorough investiga- 
tion by H. L. Cohn, Wiesbaden, 1885. 

2 This candle may be known by a red thread in the middle of the wick. 



318 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARKANGEMENT. 

chief difficulty consists in procuring amyl-acetate of unitary compo- 
sition. 1 

The height of the flame must be often measured with a 
wire fork, the points of which are fixed exactly at the dis- 
tance required (40 or 50 mm.). If the flames are too high, 
the wick must be carefully shortened. 

The determination of the intensity of the light is generally 
effected by means of the Bunsen photometer. For approxi- 
mate determinations, as they suffice for hygienic purposes, 
this instrument may be simply improvised by means of a 
rib of wood 2 m. long, graduated in centimetres, upon which 
a paper screen can be caused to slide. On the middle of the 
screen there, must be a grease spot. 

The intensity of the illumination of the screen by two 
sources of light, to the left and the right, is equal when the 
grease spot disappears if viewed from both sides, i.e., when it 
appears as bright as the parts of the screen which are not 
greased. When this point is reached, if the sources of light 
are at unequal distances from the screen, their intensities 
are inversely as the square of the distances from the screen. 

In a practical experiment the name of the normal candle and tlu- 
source of light under examination are placed in a darkened room at 
the same level to the left and the right of the screen. The screen is 
then displaced upon the rib until the grease-spot disappears, when the 
distances of the sources of light from the screen are read off. If in one 
experiment the grease-spot disappears when the normal candle was at 
the distance of 50 cm. from the screen, and the lamp to be compared 
with it at 150 cm., the intensities of the lights are as : 

2250 

1 :..: = r,0--':150-,U, * = 7so = 

The light has the luminous power of nine normal candles.

AETIFICIAL ILLUMINATION. 



319 



If we consider the illuminative material consumed in an 
hour (the weight in case of candles, petroleum, &c., and the 
volume as measured by the meter in case of gas), we can 
readily ascertain the hourly cost of the various illurninants 
per 100 normal candles. 

Simple as are the principles of these measurements, it is difficult to 
obtain absolutely correct values. For this purpose there are required 
dark rooms, costly photometers, accurately constructed, and with an. 
auxiliary flame at the screen to correct the absorption of light by the 
latter, the greatest attention to the normal candles, &c. (see Kubner, 
Lehrbuch d. Hygiene, p. 230). 

447. If the hygienist wishes to procure an apparatus 
for the measurement of light, the photometer of L. Weber 
is preferable to all others. It permits not only a measure -

ment of the intensity of sources of light, but of the degree 
of illumination of an object, e.g., of a sheet of paper, whether 
by diffused daylight or by artificial lights which is hygieni- 
cally of especial importance. 



320 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

A minute description of the apparatus would take us too 
far, and is also needless, since each such apparatus supplied 
by the firm Schmidt & Hansch is accompanied with a 
pamphlet which completely explains its use. The principle 
of the apparatus is as follows : 

Into the metal tube B, graduated longitudinally, there fall 
lights of two kinds. On the one hand light from the benzene 
burner C, capable of being accurately regulated. This light 
passes at I) through a displaceable plate of opal glass, and at 
p is entirely reflected into the right half of the field of vision 
of the eye-piece at o. At the same time, light from the 
object to be examined falls through the left-hand half of the 
tube .Z>, passing generally also through a plate of opal glass 
at (]. The nearer b is to C, the brighter is the right-hand 
field of view, and the nearer l> is to a the darker is the right- 
hand field. By a suitable displacement of 1}, both halves of 
the field of vision can be made exactly equally bright. 1 

.For absolute measurements the strength of the benzene 
burner, C (approximately one normal candle), must be exactly

plates of opal glass weaken the light,

Determination of Constants. For this purpose we place a normal 
candle (or a Hefner-Alteneck amylacetate lamp) at a known distance 
from Bi (50 cm.), and displace b until the illumination on the left and 
right is equal. 

We have now on the left : strength of the source of light = 1, dis- 
tance from the opal -glass plate at y = bQ cm. Suppose that the opal 
glass at (f allows l/x of the incident light to penetrate. On the right 
we have : strength of the source of light = 1, distance of the displace- 
able plate of opal glass from ('= E. Suppose that this plate transmit

of opal glass which is to be inserted at g, and which is supplied by the 
maker along with the apparatus. For determining the intensity of 
very powerful sources of light, several plates of opal glass may be 
introduced simultaneously at g. 

Execution of a Measurement. If an unknown source of light of m 
normal candle-power is to be compared with the Weber benzene normal 
burner, we set it at an arbitrary distance from #, e.g., 60 cm. If 
J2 = 21 cm. for an equality of light, then : 

60 2 x . 60 2 
= 2T2 >< , *?- 2T* x A. 



If the two sources of light have different colours, equality of light is 
not obtained at any position of b ; we therefore insert into the eye- 
piece a red and afterwards a green glass, and thus determine separately 
the intensity for the red and for the green rays. On this subject and 
on the application of the values, see the description which accompanies 
the instrument. 



I. USE OF THE APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE INTENSITY 
OF THE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED SURFACES EMIT IN 
METRE-CANDLES. 

1. If a matt white surface is illuminated by the flame of a normal 
candle, a spot which lies at the base of a perpendicular let fall upon 
the surface receives, according to L. Weber's definition, the luminous 
intensity of a metre-candle. If we allow this light to fall into the left 
compartment of our apparatus, and displace b until the lights are equal, 
we obtain a new constant, with which we may test surfaces of paper 
illuminated at pleasure. 

The constant is obtained on the simple assumption that the paper 
reflects 1/x of the light, and that the displaceable opal glass plate trans- 
mits \ly as before, when equality of light prevails at the distance e of 
the slide from the candle.

For carrying out an experiment light is thrown into the left com- 
partment of the apparatus from a sheet of paper, the unknown intensity

In examining a very bright light a plate of opal glass must here also 
be introduced at </, which modifies the constants accordingly.

exactly in its place the mouth of the tube BI itself, closed with a plate 
of opal glass. In calculating the constants we have then merely in 
place of \jx (the quantity of light reflected by the paper) to take 1/asi, 
i.e., the quantity of light transmitted by the opal glass. With the aid 
of the constant K., thus obtained, we proceed exactly as explained 
under 1. 

Hermann Colin demands for workrooms the following intensity of 
the illumination of the paper : if possible an illumination of 50 metre- 
candles, and as a minimum 10 metre-candles, whether in case of 
artificial or of natural illumination. The ordinary lamps give 10 
metre-candles only at a distance of m., but the intensity of the 
lighting can be enormously increased by screens and reflectors properly 
applied. 



3. HEATING AND POLLUTION OF THE AIR BY SOURCES 
OF LIGHT OF DIFFERENT STRENGTH. 

For a general view it is sufficient to examine the following

It follows that the solid illuminants (especially tallow) 
occasion by far the greatest inconvenience by the produc- 
tion of carbonic acid, of watery vapour, and by the liberation 
of heat. For gas and petroleum everything depends on the 
construction of the lamps. Well-made petroleum lamps are 
scarcely inferior to the best gas-burners ; bad petroleum 



ARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION. 323 

lamps are worse than Argand burners, but still much better 
than slit-burners, which, according to E. Fischer, contami- 
nate and heat the air from two to three times as strongly as 
Argand burners. 

In order to compare the pollution of the air in a given 
case, e.g., in a theatre with gas and electric lighting, an 
experiment has to be made with the different illuminants 
both in a full and an empty house, determining the carbonic 
acid and the temperature (if needful), also the atmospheric 
moisture at different points and at different times after the 
beginning of the lighting. The temperature in the open air, 
the ventilation, the strength of light, the number of the 
audience should, of course, be as uniform as possible if the 
observations are to be mutually comparable. The results are 
plotted out graphically and compared with each other and 
with the requirements in 151. As a pattern for such in- 
vestigations see Eenk's work mentioned in the Bibliography. 

The pollution of the air by the products of imperfect 
combustion, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrous acid, 
nitric acid, &c., can be determined quantitatively only by 
experienced chemists. But little on this subject is avail- 
able. Erismann made use of the following method: The 
air to be examined is passed through potash bulbs to re- 
move the carbonic acid, and then through a combustion- 
tube filled with ignited copper oxide. There is thus car- 
bonic acid formed from the hydrocarbons, and it is again 
taken up in absorption apparatus (Pettenkofer's baryta 
tubes) and titrated. 44 mgrm. carbonic acid correspond 
to 16 mgrm. of marsh-gas, CH 4 . E. Cramer disapproves 
of this method ; he ascertained by complicated experiments 
that from 1 grm. of illuminating material burnt there are 
formed from 0'64 to 0'85 grm. carbonic acid, whilst from 
5 to 107 mgrm. carbon is eliminated as such (soot), or is 
imperfectly burnt. The combustion is most imperfect in 
experiments of short duration with petroleum slit-burners ; 
a large part of the soot is deposited on the wick or on the 
burner, to be again burnt in the further course of the 
experiment. 



324 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS AKRANGEMENT. 

Hyponitric acid always occurs ; in contact with water it 
is converted partly into nitrous and partly into nitric acid. 
Quantitative experiments not yet concluded yielded per 
1 grm. stearine a formation of quantities of N0 2 H up to 
0-322 mgrm. ; the nitric acid formed simultaneously is not 
determined. 

The air in Cramer's own experiments was rendered tran- 
siently unpleasant to the nose by from 1-5 to 3'6 (on an 
average, 2 -2) per 1000 parts of carbonic acid. This was 
certainly occasioned by the traces of nitrous acid. How- 
ever, the initial sensation of dryness in the nose was quickly 
tolerated. A stay of two hours in air containing from 4 to 5 
per 1000 of C0 2 , generated by the combustion of coal-gas, 
had no permanent effects. Some S0 2 is probably never 
absent in the products of the combustion of coal-gas. 1 

APPENDIX I. ELECTRIC LIGHT. 

448. The electric glow-light produces no carbonic acid, 
no other substances which contaminate the air, and very 
little heat. The arc-light develops about 1 per cent, and 
the glow-light 6 per cent, of that given off by an Argand 
burner of the same illuminating power. 

The works cited in the Bibliography develop in full the 
plan of experiments by which may be shown the superiority 
of the electric light over other sources of light in the ex- 
amination of lighted buildings. It is essential for the 
observer to have the building quite at his disposal several 
times; on one occasion when filled with people, and on 
another when empty, but in any case once when lighted 
with gas, and once when illuminated electrically. Numer- 

1 It must not be forgotten that the products of the combustion of the 
common illuminants differ not merely in quantity but in quality. Sulphurous 
acid has never been detected as given off in the combustion of stearine, 
paraffine or tallow candles, nor of properly refined petroleum. It is present 
to a serious extent in the products of the combustion of coal-gas, as is shown 
by its action upon plants, books, pictures, curtains, articles of metal, &c. 
These injuries do not occur if some other source of light is introduced in 
place of gas. Editor. 



VENTILATION. 325 

ous determinations of carbonic acid, of moisture, and of 
temperature at various points of the locality, and at equal 
intervals from the beginning of the experiment, quickly give 
a clear view of the comparative conditions. The lustre of 
the electric light may be disturbing; the carbon filament 
of a glow-lamp (if reduced to an equal surface) emits a 
light twelve times stronger than that of a slit-burner, and 
seven times stronger than that of an Argand burner (Renk). 
For determinations of the lustre, which are not quite simple, 
see Eenk (Arch. f. Hygiene, iii). Shades of matt glass 
easily admit of the prevention of dazzling. From the 
hygienic point of view the electric light is beyond question 
the best next to sunlight. The fluctuations in the intensity 
of the arc-light, which hitherto are scarcely avoidable, render 
it not perfectly suitable for the illumination of rooms in 
which any fine work has to be carried on. 



V. Ventilation. 

449. In a previous section of this book it has been 
explained how the quantity of the exchange of air through 
the pores and crevices is determined ( 117). The inter- 
change of air in artificial ventilation is ascertained according 
to 116. In artificial ventilation a determination of the 
volumes of air entering and escaping will not unfrequently 
show discrepancies, even if the observations are made as 
simultaneously as possible. Especially chimneys which 
draw well often carry away more air than enters through 
the ventilation channels ; a considerable quantity of air 
penetrates through chinks, crevices, and pores. If calcula- 
tions have to be made concerning ventilation, the larger of 
the values found by the two methods is to be regarded as 
correct. 

If rooms are warmed by fresh air previously heated, its 
quantity will generally suffice for a renewal of the air. But 
if the warming is effected by means of hot bodies, an ex- 
amination of the volume of fresh air which enters will be 



326 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

necessary, as in the latter case the heating of the fresh 
air occasions special expense, and in consequence its quantity 
is often reduced too much from a mistaken economy. 

The quality of the air which enters may be controlled by 
a determination of the carbonic acid, and by the thermo- 
meter and hygrometer; for the two latter determinations 
see Heating. 

If we find a higher proportion of carbonic acid than in 
the open air (samples being taken by means of a long glass 
tube inserted in the aperture for the entrance of air), 
there is something wrong, in case of air-heating, either in 
the hot-chamber, or in the calorifer, or there is a reflux 
of air from the room into the channels, which is not un- 
common in winter when school-rooms are energetically 
heated during the intervals between school-hours. 

If the air entering is full of dust (not filtered), this is 
best detected by the deposition of dust in the heating- 
chamber, or on the heating bodies (in case of mechanical 
ventilation), or in the entrance channels. If at the same 
time the air is heated, or the calorifer is not air-tight, 
black stains near the air-inlets betray the presence of soot. 
The smell of soot and a sensation of dryness in the throat 
assist in the detection of smoke in the air. Not unfrequently 
this sensation is erroneously referred to an excessive dryness 
of the air. 

We must never be content with the mere removal of air, 
since the air entering is often derived from localities where 
it is accompanied by offensive smells (kitchens, privies, &c.). 
In mechanical ventilation pressure is from the same reason 
always to be preferred to suction. 

The inlet for warmed air is generally placed at the height 
of the human head ; the exit for the air which has been used 
is twofold, one for winter at the level of the floor, and one 
for summer aloft, and capable of being opened or closed by 
valves. Anemometers and determinations of carbonic acid 
suffice to reply to the question whether one or the other 
exit is to be preferred at any given time. Abt (Hyg. Rund- 
schau, i. 148) has discussed this question in an investigation 



HEATING. 317 

containing many interesting details. On ventilating valves 
at room-stoves see 451. 

In ventilation by mechanical appliances (wing-screws, 
water-jet ventilators), it must also be considered whether 
an annoying noise is not produced which is often conveyed 
to a distance in the ventilating pipes. (In water-jet ventila- 
tors this may be avoided by lining the pipe with felt near 
the rose.) We must also consider whether drops of water 
may be projected into the room along with the compressed 
air, and whether the air (generally not warmed) is not intro- 
duced in such compact streams as to annoy persons sitting 
near the inlet. If a valve is fixed obliquely before the 
apertures, compelling the air to enter laterally, complaints 
will rarely be occasioned. 

For an adult in dwelling-rooms we generally require, as 
a minimum, 20 cbm. of air (for hospitals two or three times 
as much). More modern hospitals afford 100 cbm. space 
and upwards per bed, which deserves to be much appreci- 
ated. Three interchanges of air per hour are practicable 
without occasioning a draught (i.e., a velocity of wind not 
exceeding 0.7 m.), but not more. A minimum of 60 cbm. of 
air is thus always available. A renewal of the air is not 
possible without occasioning the sensation of a draught if 
the velocity of the wind exceeds 0*7 in. 

For schools about from 5 to 6 cbm. per child is a minimum. 
The proposed Imperial law demands for bedrooms for child- 
ren under 10 years of age 5 cbm., and for each elder person 
at least 10 cbm. Even if a sufficient supply of air is secured 
in some other manner, there must be at least 1 sdm. of 
window-surface for each child, and for each adult double 
the surface (Draught Imperial law). 

VI. Heating. 

450. A description of the various heating systems with 
their advantages and disadvantages, especially, from an 
economical point of view, is explained in the text-books 
on hygiene. The means to control the effect of a heating 



328 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

installation are simple. Both for central and local heating 
the following must be undertaken : 

1. The temperature must be determined in various parts 
of the room by thermometers, protected if needful by the 
interposition of boards against direct radiation. Such in- 
vestigations throughout the house are particularly needful 
in central heating arrangements, since they often bring to 
light serious defects in the distribution of warmth, especially 
in defective heating with air-pipes. 

2. Determination of atmospheric moisture according to 
119, and a decision according to 151. Contrivances for 
moistening the air may be tested by observing their effects 
with the hygrometer. Too strong moistening may cause 
the masonry (which is colder than the air of the room) 
to be thoroughly moistened, and it must therefore be avoided 
at least as much as dry air. 1 

i. Stove Heating. 

451. In heating with stoves we must especially consider : 
1. Testing the radiant heat of the stove with the blackened 
bulb thermometer ( 104). Generally speaking, we wish to 
warm with radiant heat as little as possible. Metal stoves 
radiate more strongly because their surfaces are much more 
strongly heated. In order to reach conclusions comparative 
experiments should be made on different stoves which warm 
the room equally, using the same thermometer. (For the 
more accurate examination with the thermic battery see 



1 It would be utterly useless to describe the construction of English house- 
fires. They warm a room entirely by radiant heat, and are calculated to 
waste 90 per cent, of the heat generated by the combustion of the fuel. Hence 
they have become more and more objectionable as coal is rendered dearer in 
consequence of the exhaustion of the more superficial beds, the higher wages 
of the colliers, and the operations of the coal-merchants. They have the dis- 
advantage of producing large quantities of dust, soot, and smoke, and of 
rendering different parts of a room very unequal in temperature. Many 
German authorities do not admit the alleged hygienic advantages of radiant 
heat (Dr. F. Fischer). The open fire-place ventilates the lower part of a 
room too strongly, but leaves the air in the upper part stagnant. This evil is 
the worse the lower the grate is placed. Editor. 



STOVE HEATING. 329 

Eubner's Lehrlucli der Hygiene, p. 241.) The action of stove 
screens must be checked in the same manner. 

2. The temperature of the surface of the stove may also be examined. 
For earthenware stoves it is sufficient to apply a thermometer to the 
stove, keeping it in its place with a pad of wadding and a card. For 
iron stoves alloys of known melting-points ( 100). 

It is hygienically useful to keep the temperature low, certainly not 
exceeding 100 ; at higher temperatures the fine dust which deposits on 
the stove is consumed, and the pyrogenous products formed irritate 
the mucous membranes. At the same time there is the danger that 
children burn themselves. 1 A smooth surface and a good lining of 
fire-clay in the iron parts are important for preventing the ignition of 
dust, and for preventing excessive heat. 

Examination as to length of time required to reach a desired tem- 
perature, or a certain rise of temperature. It is in such experiments 
necessary for the external temperatures to be alike. 

3. Structure of the chimney. Examination whether the 
stoves "draw." Chimneys have a round or quadratic sec- 
tion in order to facilitate cleansing with brushes and balls. 
The diameter is, according to the size of the bricks, from 
15 to 20 cm., or for larger heating installations from 25 
to 30 cm. Two or three stoves may vent into one 
chimney if they are otherwise properly constructed. The 
chimney should be carried vertically from the stove to the 
highest point of the roof (or of any loftier roofs adjoining), 
and should run in the inner not outer walls, in order 
to avoid, as far as possible, the influence of the varying 
external temperature, and of the wind. For the sake of 
cleanliness it is advantageous if the chimney runs below the 
stove down into the cellar, so that the soot can be removed 
both here and on the roof, or in the attics in the case of 
steep roofs. A slight inclination from the perpendicular is 
permissible ; the angle of the incline must not exceed 30, 
and the elbow should be carefully rounded off. 

A chimney is tested for draught by lighting paper in it, 
or holding a burning match at the stove door; the paper 
should burn briskly without smoke, and the match should 
be blown out or flare strongly. 

1 This danger is naturally much greater with open fires. In Britain many 
children and women are thus burnt to death or seriously injured. Editor. 



330 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

As the column of air in the chimney is colder than the 
open air (height of summer, a warm day in winter after 
severe cold), it may be necessary, even in the best con- 
structed chimneys, to burn first some paper in the stove. 
If a chimney seems blocked up with soot the chimneysweep 
should be consulted. 

4. Stoves with very narrow exit-flues or pipes, and especi- 
ally those without smoke-vents, should always be condemned, 
since they show that they are apt to contaminate the air 
strongly with carbonic acid, or possibly carbon monoxide. 

This applies as well to the so-called carbonnatro stoves. 
They pollute the air abundantly with carbon monoxide ; it 
applies also to all gas-stoves, such as are still frequently in 
use in bath-rooms, and often without an exit-pipe. Carbon 
monoxide is not here formed, but carbonic acid is produced up 
to from 2 to 3 per cent., and at the same time the propor- 
tion of oxygen is diminished by from 3 to 4 per cent, (see 
151). Severe fainting fits and direct danger to life may 
be occasioned (see Knorr, Arch. f. Hygiene, xi.). The nose 
readily detects smoke-gases ; smoke contains 8 to 10 per 
cent, of carbonic acid. 

5. Stove Valve. Stove-valves of the old construction in the chimney 
which at a given moment allow the latter to be entirely shut oft', 
should be legally prohibited as quite anti-sanitary. If they are so con- 
structed that not more than three-quarters of the section can be shut 
off there is little objection to be made, as the danger of poisoning with 
carbon monoxide seems removed. 

The desired object is not entirely gained by the use of 
screwed stove-doors in place of valves, especially in case of 
tile-stoves, as the air of the room penetrates into the interior 
of the stove through joints and chinks, and thence into the 
chimney, which is rather rapidly cooled. Especially in self- 
replenishing stoves the degree of accuracy with which the 
degree of combustion may be governed by regulating the 
supply of air requires examination. An inspection of the 
colour of the fire through windows of mica is generally 
sufficient in a dark room. 

It is easy to ascertain whether a so-called Degenklob 



CENTRAL HEATING INSTALLATIONS. 331 

ventilation-trap acts. This apparatus is a throttle-valve, 
which closes a short ventilation-tube opening downwards 
where the smoke-flue makes an upward elbow. When the 
fire is burning brightly its supply of air is partially closed, 
and the throttle- valve is opened. A measurement with the 
anemometer determines the effect of this excellent venti- 
lating arrangement. 

6. I must refer to technical treatises for the question what stoves best 
fulfil their purpose. In general, small stoves with short pipes utilise 
the heat imperfectly. An increase of the surface by means of ribs and 
open spaces surrounded by flues is practical. (The large stoves which 
are still customary in isolated places, and in Berlin, utilise the heat much 
better.) It is more advantageous to feed several stoves, placed side by 
side or one above another, from one fire-place. The hearth may serve 
as fire-place (a throttle- valve which in summer cuts off the heating-gases 
from the way to the stoves, and which at the same time opens a direct 
passage to the chimney, should then be provided). In other cases the 
fire-place is preferably served from the entrance-hall, whereby dust, 
ashes, and dirt are kept at a distance from the dwelling-rooms. 



2. Central Heating Installations. 

452. The complicated technical examinations of such 
arrangements do not fall within the plan of this work. The 
skilled hygienist can, however, very well determine the effect 
of such heating by means of the thermometer, hygrometer, 
and, if needed, the anemometer (see 450) ; special apparatus 
are not needed. 

In all varieties of heating by means of air, simple or com- 
pound (fire-, water-, steam-, steam and water-, air-heating) 
the temperature of the heated air must not exceed 40, or at 
the outside 60. This may be attained by placing ribs or 
steam-pipes on the calorifers, or by leading such pipes through 
wide water-mains. 

Among central-heating arrangements those with hot air 
give principally cause for complaint, because formerly they 
were often constructed in a negligent manner. I discuss 
them, therefore, thoroughly, and add merely a few remarks 
on the other systems of heating. 

1. The inlet- channel for air into the heating-chamber should 



332 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

be open to inspection, having smooth sides, should be easily 
cleansed, and should be actually clean. When this is not the 
case the deposit of dust as a bad conductor may easily inter- 
fere with the utility of heating. At high temperatures the 
dust burns away ( 449). Heating-chambers should be 
lighted up by windows, whitewashed, completely enclosed. 
The calorifers should be kept so clean that no soot can enter 
the chamber. (The doors for cleaning open outwards.) 

2. The calorifers should be large so that they need not be 
heated too strongly, and they should be lined with clay as 
far as the flame reaches. The combustion of dust can be 
effected only by this means. The air in the heating-chamber 
should not be hotter than from 80 to 100. Thermometers 
must be provided. A good automatic regulation of the fire, 
as has been recently aimed at (Rietschel and Henneberg), 
greatly improves the system. 

3. The air must be freed from dust by filtering-cloth and 
a " water-veil " (fine artificial rain). For an examination of 
filtering tissues see Eietschel, Gesundheits Ingcnieur, 1889, p. 
106. The filter-cloths must be brushed every fourteen days. 

4. There should be an arrangement for the evaporation of 
clean water in the heating-chamber, which is automatically 
supplied in the evaporation- vessels. 

5. Complaints about the distribution of temperature in 
hot-air arrangements in the various stories of a house, or in 
the different rooms of a tenement, should lead to an examina- 
tion whether the hot-air pipes in the upper stories are 
suitably narrower than in the lower, and if the rooms which 
lie horizontally from the source of heat are provided with 
pipes of a sufficient width. But even in case of correct 
dimensions of the pipes an unbearable heat may be produced 
in the upper stories if the valves in the lower stories are 
closed as soon as the inmates consider their rooms sufficiently 
warm. 

In heating with hot water care must be taken that the 
pipes are free from dust, and secure against frost. They 
should be easily accessible, and be yearly submitted to a 
thorough cleansing before being used for heating. In case 



WATER-SUPPLY. 333 

of constant use freezing is not to be feared ; where the use 
is intermittent serious trouble is often occasioned by over- 
flows into dwelling-rooms. That hot-water heating at high 
pressure can be arranged only with correspondingly strong 
and faultless pipes, and is better avoided in place of a safer 
heating with warm water, is a matter of course. 

In heating with steam-pipes inclosed portions of water 
are to be avoided, as they occasion much annoyance by 
keeping up a hammering noise. Accumulations of air in 
portions of the piping which have been temporarily left out 
of use are to be feared. This misfortune is most common in 
low-pressure steam systems, and it greatly interferes with 
the efficacy of the system, especially when its management 
is left to servants. The manner of construction should 
exclude all such disturbances. Arrangements affected with 
such faults should not be accepted. 

The introduction of the stand-pipe and the expansion 
vessel in low-pressure steam heating require caution, since 
if the pressure of 1-5 atmosphere is exceeded, boiling water 
may be projected out. 

In low-pressure steam-heating the encased pipes require 
especial examination, i.e., whether the casing does not in fact 
completely prevent the emission of heat from the pipes, &c. 
Thermometric measurements allow a decision on this head. 



VII. Water-Supply. 

453. In addition to the points explained in the section 
on " Water," we must add : 

1. The Examina tion of House- Cisterns, if any. They should 
consist of sheet-iron coated with enamel colours free from 
lead, but not of lead, tin, or zinc. Lead is inadmissible even 
where leaden pipes may be used (see 201, 6), as in a 
cistern the access of air is always promoted. An inspection 
of the cistern often reveals impurities : entrance of dust in 
consequence of defective adjustment and covering, develop- 
ment of dense flocculent masses of bacteria, larvae of aquatic 
insects, &c. 



334 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

The overflow-pipes of cisterns should not open into the 
soil-pipe of a W.C. without the intervention of a syphon. 

2. Examination of the security of the water-pipes 
especially narrow branch-pipes against frost. 

Water-pipes should not lie against the outer walls, or if placed there 
they should be surrounded with a heat preservative mass (asbestos, 
cork, slag-wool, kiesel-guhr, &c.). Such a coating is also necessary in 
rooms which are rarely heated (W.C., bath). The main inflow and out- 
flow pipes should lie at lea*t from O8 to I'OO in. below the earth in 
order to remain at a uniform temperature. 1 



VIII. Removal of Foul Water (House 
Sewerage). 

454. In an examination it must first be ascertained 
whether the foul waters from the house fall into a sewer or 
into a settling-pit. In houses w T hich stand alone the latter 
is the only possible method if no discharge into a stream is 
possible ; but it is at least requisite that the settling-pit 
should be sufficiently far from the house. 

In the course of the foul water to the settling-pit, it is 
advisable to arrange one or two small well-cemented pits 
as clarifying tanks, so that the water in the settling-pit is 
clear enough to be used for watering vegetables. These 
clarifying tanks should be easily cleansed. 

The water-pipes in the house must fit tightly; they must 
never be of stoneware with tarred joints but of iron with 
lead joints ; and where they are connected with inlets, 
water-joints must be used. In new buildings the syphon is 
often omitted, especially in baths, wash-houses, c., owing to 
the negligence of the persons executing the work. The 
water-joints are generally pipes bent in the shape of a U. 
More complicated joints are often used in kitchen drain- 
pipes. If the present joints act badly, so that sewer-gases 



1 It need scarcely be added that cisterns are to be condemned from a 
sanitary point of view. In practice they are never made dust-proof. In those 
cities in Britain where the water-supply is in the hands of the municipality, 
cisterns are as a rule absent, and water can be obtained from the pipes at 
any moment.- Editor. 



REMOVAL OF FOUL WATER. 335 

may penetrate into dwellings, it is necessary to ascertain it' 
one of the following main errors does not occur (Eenk) : 

1. The soil-pipe does not vent freely above the roof. It 
is desirable that both the kitchen drain-pipe and the exit- 
pipe from the W. C. should pass above the roof. 

2. The soil-pipe is too narrow in proportion to the outflow- 
pipes. 

3. The pipes leading clown from the gratings of the sinks, 
or from their syphons, are abnormally wide, so that on abun- 
dant pouring, emptying jugs of water, &c., even a wide exit- 
pipe runs full, and the syphon concerned, or those lying 
above it, are emptied or much weakened, while those below 
are overpowered. 

4. The joints are so badly constructed that the column of 
water which forms the junction is only a few millimetres 
high ; and if there is any inaccuracy in the fitting of the 
joint it is altogether useless. Such a joint also very quickly 
fails if it is allowed to stand for a time unused in hot weather 
(evaporation of the water). 

5. More complicated joints, instead of having a narrow 
peripheric and a wide central limb, are often in error con- 
structed in the inverse manner, so that any action weakens 
the joint to a great degree. It must be accepted as a prin- 
ciple that the pipe for the escape of foul water must always 
be expanded from the grate of the sink to the house sewer, 
but never contracted. 

The very slight over- pressure of the sewer air over the air 
of the room positive or negative is never able to break 
through a water-joint of a few centimetres in height. All 
overpowering or exhaustion of water-joints is due merely to 
condensations or expansions of air which occur in the soil- 
pipe by the abundant influx of water, if the enclosed air can- 
not communicate with the external air without hindrance or 
interruption from any of the defects enumerated under 1-4. 

6. The arrangement is indeed properly constructed, but 
has been carried out imperfectly (bad cementing, soldering 
of the several pieces of pipe), or it may have become defec- 
tive (iron pipes may have been corroded by rust, tubes of 



336 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

zinc or lead may have been attacked by sewage in conjunc- 
tion with sewage gases, or of moist mortar or cement ; leaden 
pipes may have been gnawed by rats or by the larvae of 
solitary wasps, rupture of the pipes by frost, &c.). 

7. Lastly, putrid odours are not necessarily occasioned by 
sewage gases, in the strict sense of the term ; syphons filled 
with putrescent matter, floors or false flooring impregnated 
with filth, may sometimes simulate the entrance of sewage 
gases. As to the hygienic importance of sewage gases see 
the next paragraph. 

In an inquiry at what point sewage gases escape the nose 
plays the most important part, if the leak is not large enough 
to be at once visible. The deflection of the flame of a candle, 
or the production of soap-bubbles after the suspected part 
has been coated over with thick soap-froth, are important 
means of detection. In kitchen sinks the examination is 
best undertaken after dinner, as then the outfall pipes are 
slightly warmed by the passage of the slops, and sewer-gases 
will be evolved plentifully. Strongly-scented ethereal oils 
(oil of aniseed, &c.) have been poured into the pits or house 
drains in order to give a definite odour to the escaping 
sewer-gases. 

IX. Closets. 

455. Every closet must have a window leading into the 
open air ; the soil-pipe must be prolonged above the roof, 
and have a free opening above. If the water-supply and 
the water-joints are good a ventilation from the staircase or 
by air-shafts may suffice. 

If water is not laid on in the closet, the soil-pipe of each 
seat cannot be shut off from the main-pipe by a syphon, as 
the contents of such a syphon (faeces and urine) would 
pollute the air at least as strongly as any sewage gases 
which might enter. The outfall of the fcecal matters should 
be facilitated by causing the lateral soil-pipes to vent into 
the main-pipe at an acute angle, and an escape of sewage 
gas is to be prevented by a valve which generally closes the 



CLOSETS. 337 

funnel of the basin, or, better still, by heating or exhausting 
the main soil-pipe ; narrow soil-pipes easily become choked, 
and sometimes freeze up in winter. 

The soil-pipe is most cheaply heated by placing it next the kitchen 
chimney. A branch from the soil-pipe may be carried into the upper 
or lower part of such chimneys, or into an adjacent fume-pipe. A 
ventilation of the closet, in the absence of water-joints, is very danger- 
ous ; if the sewer-gases are warmer than the external air they escape 
into the closet, and that the more readily the easier is the outlet through 
the open window. On the other hand, a close connection of the soil- 
pipe to the removal-pail, or the cesspool, greatly impedes the escape of 
sewage gases (Von Pettenkofer). 1 

We may ascertain by means of a benzoic acid match whether 
sewage gas escapes from the seat ; the anemometer ( 114), if 
held in the opening of the closet-funnel, gives a quantitative 
estimation of the movement of the air ( 116). The water- 
tightness of the soil-pipe can often be ascertained only by 
removing its wooden casing. The water-tightness of a tub 2 
is found by inspecting its place. To determine the water- 
tightness of cesspools is difficult. Even well-cemented cess- 
pools are not absolutely impervious for a long time; the 
more rarely a pool of moderate size is filled and emptied, the 
more pervious and the more dangerous it becomes. An 
examination of the soil around the cesspool for Nad, &c., 
permits a definite conclusion. Depositing tanks for faecal 
matter are absolutely inadmissible. 

456. In water-closets simple flat U-shaped syphons are 
effective against sewage gases. The effectiveness of the water 
influx must be controlled experimentally. Closets in which 
the fseces fall into water facilitate rinsing away, as the 
excrementitious matter does not adhere, and thus economise 
water, but cause annoyance during defsecation by splashing. 
Weak rotating currents of water which fall into wide, dish- 

1 This passage refers only to towns where the "pail system" or the old 
cesspool arrangement is still in vogue. In most British towns the soil-pipes 
vent into the public sewers. Cesspools are tolerated only in country places.

338 A DWELLING-HOUSE AND ITS ARRANGEMENT. 

shaped basins are unpractical ; they often merely drive the 
faeces round in a circle. 

If there is abundance of water at a considerable pressure 
at disposal, it may be taken directly from the pipes to rinse 
out the basin, simply turning a cock. Against this arrange- 
ment there are no hygienic objections, though prejudices 
often prevail. If the water-supply is obtained from cisterns 
they must be fixed sufficiently high, and must be of adequate 
capacity to effect a proper action. 

The fearful smell often met with from water-closets, apparently well 
constructed, often becomes intelligible if we remove the wooden casing 
of the pan. There appear then imperfect joints, and infiltrations of 
polluted water into the non-ventilated corners between the seat and the 
casing. On several occasions I could detect merely an imperfect con- 
nection of the water-pipe with the rinsing arrangement as the cause of 
the mouldy smell ; a flexible pipe connected both, and had been secured 
with a brass wire, which was corroded away, and now allowed an escape 
whenever the water was turned on. 

I cannot enlarge more fully on the construction of house 
and street sewers. They can be examined -as to their imper- 
viousness or water-tightness only by laying them bare- 
especially the stratum of earth underneath the sewer, and its 
chemical examination ( 156). Whether their incline is 
sufficient must be ascertained by examining the sewage 
matters which accumulate in them in course of time. A 
" revision-shaft," which is officially required in many cities 
at the spot where the house-sewer vents into the street or 
court-sewer, greatly facilitates an examination. 

For a formal decision concerning an entire sewerage system there 
are, above all things, required, in addition to technical knowledge and 
practical experience, a most accurate acquaintance with local circum- 
stances, the incline of the ground, the rainfall, the existence of brooks 
for rinsing, &c. Especial methods of examination are scarcely requisite. 

It is very important here for the sections of the sewers to be duly 
proportioned, so that always narrow sewers may open into wider ones, 
and not inversely, and that the bottoms of the drains are narrow and 
smooth. These essentials have often been neglected in old sewerage 
systems. 

The danger to health of sewage gas is estimated extremely 
high in England. In numerous instances attacks of typhoid 



CLOSETS. 339 

fever are especially attributed to the respiration of sewage 
gases. In Germany Uffelman adopts to some extent the 
English point of view, whilst Pettenkofer, Soyka, and Eenk 
maintain that the toxicity of sewage gases has not been 
hitherto demonstrated by the illness of the inhabitants of 
sewered houses. 

A circumspect hygienist must unconditionally admit the possibility 
of an injurious action of certain septic gases in a concentrated state, 
although hitherto no especially poisonous gases are known except 
sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia. Interesting experiments have 
been made by Herbert Barker (Sanitary Review, 1158) on dogs, birds, 
and mice concerning the action of sewages gases and the air of cesspools. 
He observed in these animals, shut up in chests traversed by the air in 
question, faintness, trembling, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhoea. 
According to special experiments with sulphuretted hydrogen, he is 
disposed to attribute the chief result in the experiments to the effects of 
this gas. Unfortunately he has contented himself with qualitative 
analyses of the air in the chests (H 2 S, NH 4 S, C0 2 ). Odoriferous sub- 
stances, as yet imperfectly known, may easily play a part in the 
poisonings. Literature certainly contains somewhat numerous reports 
of illness occasioned by inhaling the perfume of flowers (see Chevallier 
tils, Annal. d' Hygiene, 1865, p. 293). Vallin reports cases which he 
regards as poisoning by the use of putrid, stinking paste in putting up 
paper-hangings, or by washing walls with a putrescent glue colour 
(Annal. d'Hygiene, 1880, p. 50). Still an infection of typhoid 1 in this 
manner will always appear to us incomprehensible, since sewage air is 
always poor in micro-organisms, or free from them entirely, and as the 
men employed in sewers are nowhere especially liable to infectious 
diseases. 

Decidedly more dangerous are sewers, settling-pits, &c., which are 
not air-tight, as they occasion the soil to be saturated with nutriment 
for micro-organisms. 

It is clear that incautious manipulation of relatively recent 
fecal matter on the part of scavengers (want of cleanliness) 



1 The bacilli of typhoid (Centralblatt f. JJakteriologie, v. p. 530) persist, 
according to Uffelmann, at least 5J months at 17 ; the bacilli of cholera were 
mostly reduced in number after twenty-four hours, and destroyed often after 
forty-eight hours, but always after three to four days. This was also observed 
by Kitasato and Kaupe, whilst Gruber discovered cholera bacilli in the dejec- 
tions of cholera patients after fifteen days, and Karlinski after twenty-five 
days. Schiller (Arb. aus dem Kaiserl. Gesundhcitsamt, vi. 1890) found cholera 
bacilli still living in sewage, and in a mixture of fresh urine and faeces for 
thirteen to fourteen days ; typhoid bacilli six days in sewage, and from one 
to four weeks in a mixture of urine and faeces. 



340 A DWELLING-HOUSE AttD ITS AKRANGEMENT. 

may occasion infections ; but there are cases, such as those 
described by Ducamp (Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, viii. 404), 
which are very difficult to explain. Six workmen at Mont- 
pellier, who drew out a disgustingly stinking vessel from a 
choked-up drain, were all taken ill with different intensities 
partially with the incubation stage of a gastric nervous 
affection, complicated with tetanus. Intestinal symptoms 
and typhus fever were absent. What gas can the vessel 
have given oft 1 ?

SECTION XVIIL 
ARTICLES OF USE, OR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES. 

457. As articles of use we characterise all those sub- 
stances which play a certain part in the household, whether 
in connection with food (cooking utensils, wrapping-papers) 
or with dwellings (carpets, curtains, lamp-screens) or cloth- 
ing (tissues, paper-collars, flowers, &c.), or come otherwise in 
more or less intimate contact with mankind in daily use 
(address-cards, toys, quack medicines, requisites for the 
toilet, &c.). 

The hygienist has to examine these articles for a great 
number of injurious substances, inorganic and organic, 
especially poisonous metallic salts and poisonous colours. 
It seemed, therefore, judicious to reserve to this section 
whatever might have been said in earlier chapters on the 
detection of and the decision on such substances, and to 
enlarge this section to a condensed chemistry of the most 
important poisons, or to a toxicology of the most important 
substances in the household. 

Here it was necessary, if the compass of the book should 
not be exceeded, to observe a careful limitation to questions, 
the solution of which might be successfully undertaken by 
less experienced operators, and to substances to which 
(rightly or wrongly) an especial hygienic importance is at 
present ascribed. 

As a matter of course substances which only occasionally 
from grave negligence lead to poisoning cases (lye, sul- 
phuric acid, petroleum, phenol, &c.), will not be here taken 
into consideration. For the sake of convenience wo consider 
the examination of and the decision on inorganic and organic 
substances separately.

344 AKTICLES OF USE. 

458. As an introduction we here communicate the two 
German statutes on this subject, since they are founded 
upon careful consideration of the demands of hygiene and 
of technics, and may be regarded as happy compromises. 



STATUTE CONCERNING THE TRAFFIC IN ARTICLES CONTAINING 
LEAD AND ZINC. June 25, 1887. 

1. Implements for eating, drinking, and cooking, and measures for 
cooking may not be made 

1. Entirely or partly of lead, or of a metallic alloy containing more 

than 10 per cent, by weight of lead. 

2. May not be coated inwardly with a metallic alloy containing more 

than 1 per cent, by weight of lead, or be soldered with a metallic 
alloy which contains more than 10 parts of lead in 100 parts of 
the alloy. 

3. May not be provided with enamel or glazing which, if boiled 

for thirty minutes in vinegar containing 4 per cent, by weight 
of acetic acid, gives off lead to the solvent. 

The prescription under figure 2 concerning solder does not extend to 
table-ware or measures for liquids made of Britannia metal free from 
lead. 

For the construction of so-called beer-engines, and for syphons for 
beverages charged with carbonic acid, for the metallic parts of sucking- 
bottles for infants, only such alloys may be used as contain in 100 parts 
not more than 1 per cent, by weight of lead. 

2. For the construction of mouth-pieces for sucking-bottles, sucking- 
rings, and shields for corns, caoutchouc containing lead or zinc may not 
be used. 

Plumbiferous caoutchouc may not be used for drinking-cups and for 
toys, with the exception of massive balls. 

Flexible piping made of plumbiferous caoutchouc may not be used 
for beer, wine, or vinegar. 

3. Vessels and appliances for the preparation of beverages and fruit- 
juices may not be constructed contrary to the directions of 1 in those 
parts which in their intended or probable use come in immediate 
contact with the contents. 

Boxes for preserved meats or fruits must be made on the inside in 
conformity with the conditions of 1. 

For keeping beverages, vessels must not be used in which there are 
remnants of leaden shot. For enveloping snuff and chewing-tobacco, 
as also cheese, metal-foil must not be used containing more than 1 per- 
cent, by weight of lead. 

The fourth paragraphs relate to penalties, &c. The law came into 
force on October 1, 1888. 



ARTICLES OF USE. 345 

STATUTE CONCERNING THE USE OF INJURIOUS COLOURS IN 
THE PREPARATION OF FOODS, ARTICLES OF CONSUMPTION, 
AND OBJECTS OF UTILITY. July 5, 1887. 

1.1. Colours injurious to health may not be used in the production 
of articles of food or enjoyment, if intended for sale. 

2. Injurious colours in the meaning of this law are those colouring- 
matters and preparations of colours which contain antimony, arsenic, 
barium, cadmium, chrome, copper, coralline, gamboge, lead, mercury, 
picric acid, tin, uranium, zinc. The Imperial Chancellor is empowered 
to issue detailed directions concerning the methods to be adopted in 
determining the presence of arsenic and tin. 

2. 1. For preserving or packing up articles of food or enjoyment 
which are intended for sale, vessels, wrappings, and covers may not be 
used if in their manufacture colours of the kind specified in 1, section 
2, have been employed. 

2. This determination does not extend to the use of barium sul- 
phate, chromic oxide, copper, tin, zinc, and their alloys as metallic 
colours, cinnabar, stannic oxide, tin sulphide, as mosaic gold, as also 
all colours burnt in upon vitrified masses, glazes, and enamels, and 
also the outer coating of vessels of waterproof materials. 

3. For the production of cosmetics (articles for cleansing, preserving, 
or colouring the skin, the hair, or the inside of the mouth) intended 
for sale, the substances mentioned in 1, section 2, must not be used. 
This regulation does not apply to barium sulphate (heavy spar, blanc 
fixe), cadmium sulphide, chromic oxide, cinnabar, zinc oxide, tin oxide, 
zinc sulphide, or to copper, tin, or zinc in the state of powders. 

4. 1. Those colours specified under 1, section 2, must not be used 
in the manufacture of toys, including sheets or books of pictures, 
and water-colours for children), frame- work for flower-pots, and arti- 
ficial Christmas-trees. 

2. This regulation does not apply to the substances mentioned in 2, 
section 2, as also to antimony sulphide and cadmium sulphide as 
colouring-matters for gum mass, lead oxide in varnish, white lead as an 
ingredient in so-called wax-casting, but only if it does not exceed 
1 part by weight in 100 piarts by weight of the mass, lead chromate 
(alone or in combination with lead sulphate) as an oil or lake colour, or 
with a coating of varnish or lacquer, compounds of zinc insoluble in 
water, but in case of caoutchouc toys, only in so far as they are used to 
colour the caoutchouc mass, as oil or lake colours, or with a coating of 
lacquer or varnish, and all colours burnt in, as glazes or enamels. As 
far as the substances mentioned in 7 and 8 are used in the manu- 
facture of toys, the regulations laid down in 7 and 8 apply simply to 
the latter. 

5. For the production of letterpress and lithographic printing upon 
the articles enumerated in 2, 3, and 4, only those colours are pro- 
hibited which contain arsenic. 



346 ARTICLES OF USE. 

6. Water-colours of every kind may not be sold or offered for sale 
as free from unwholesome or poisonous matters if they do not conform 
to the regulations in 4, sections 1 and 2. 

7. In the manufacture of paper-hangings, furniture-prints, carpets, 
tissues for curtains or hangings, masks, candles, artificial leaves, flowers, 
and fruits, colours which contain arsenic may not be used. But this 
regulation does not apply to the application of arsenical mordants and 
fixing agents for the purpose of dyeing or printing warps or tissues. 
But such warps and tissues may not be used in the production of the 
articles specified in section 1 if they contain the arsenic in a form 
soluble in water, or in such a proportion that more than 2 mgrm. 
arsenic are present in 100 scm. of the product when finished. The 
Imperial Chancellor is empowered to issue detailed instructions as to 
the means to be adopted for determining the proportion of arsenic. 

8. The regulations in No. 7 apply also to the manufacture of 
writing-materials intended for sale, lamps and light-screens, &c. The 
production of wafers is subject to the regulations in 1, though with 
the proviso that, if they are not intended to be eaten, the use of barium 
sulphate (heavy spar, blanc fixe), chromic oxide, and vermilion is 
permitted. 

9. Arsenical water- or size-colours may not be employed for the 
preparation of washes for floors, ceilings, walls, doors, windows of 
dwelling- or work-rooms, for shutters or curtains, furniture, and other 
articles of domestic use. 

10. The regulations of 2-9 do not apply to the use of colours 
which contain the substances scheduled in 1, section 2, not as con- 
stituent ingredients, but merely as impurities, and at most in quantities 
unavoidable according to the methods of production technically in 
use. 

11-15 contain penalties. The law came into force May 1, 1888. 

459. Whilst the law of the empire lays down a limit 
of admissibility only for arsenic, Prior and E. Kayser have 
proposed the following limits for other elements, seeking as 
far as possible to take practical relations into account. The 
Bavarian chemists had adopted these figures, but the law of 
the empire considers it better to trust to the experience of 
experts, rather than to fetter their freedom of judgment by 
limit-numbers. These limits, however, seem to me very 
useful for the guidance of less experienced hygienists, as 
they agree fairly well with sanitary requirements. 

There may be sanctioned as impurities in 100 grin, of the permitted 
colours the following quantities of those which are prohibited : 
a. Antimony, arsenic, chrome, copper, lead, together or of each, 
0*2 Qrm. 



OBTAINING MATERIAL FOR EXAMINATION. 347 

6. Barium, cobalt, nickel, tin, uranium, 1 zinc, jointly or of each, 
1 -0 grm. 

In general, according to Prior, 1 grm. of an opaque colour is needed 
for 100 scm. of painted wood, or 600 sera, of coloured paper or paper- 
hangings. 

Lastly, the Bavarian chemists plead for the sanction of as much as 
12 per cent, zinc chromate in green mixed colours (zinc-green, 490) 
for coloured papers, artificial flowers, and paper-hangings, and as much 
as 3 per cent, of barium carbonate in coloured lakes. For antimony in 
yarns and tissues they propose the same strict limits as the Imperial 
law does for arsenic.

I. Obtaining the Material for Examination in a 
Form suitable for Analysis. 

460. As the operations to be described below are gene- 
rally to lead not only to qualitative but also to quantitative 
results, it is often necessary to set out with a weighed 
quantity, and to avoid every loss in working. The material 
must undergo very different kinds of treatment in order to 
be fit for analysis. 

1. Metal vessels, metal coatings, metal foil for packages, 
&c. 3 We weigh off from \ grm. to 1 grm. in the form of 

1 According to Robert and Woroschilsky, uranium is equal to arsenic in 
toxicity, and should therefore be placed in class a. See Arbeit, des Pharmak. 
Instit. zu Dorpat., Part V., 1890. 

2 What is here said does not refer to free yellow phosphorus. For its 
detection the matter in question is distilled in an apparatus similar to that in 
Fig. 84, but with an upright condenser. Into the flask a standing in the 
water-bath is put the substance in question, ground up with water to a thin 
paste, and acidulated with sulphuric acid. From the flask b there is passed a 
powerful current of steam through a and the condenser. Then when the 
steam condenses in the cooler there appears, if the room is darkened, a 
splendid phosphorescent ring. Small fractions of a milligramme give this 
reaction. The distillate in d gives the reaction of phosphoric acid only if free 
phosphoric acid was present, which is tested for according to 185. 

3 In order to test the thickness of silvering or nickelising, we place a 
measured piece of the metal in dilute nitric acid until fresh acid ceases to 
dissolve any more of the metal required, and proceed then according to the 
systematic process ( 462). 

II the more exact nature or the purity of the layer of tin on sheet-iron has

fine particles, detached from the substance with a pen-knife, 
scissors, or a glass file, and dissolve by boiling in dilute 
nitric acid, to which hydrochloric acid may be added if a 
white powder (metastannic acid, Sn0 3 H 2 ) remains undis- 
solved. We may, however, at once collect the metastannic 
acid upon a filter for analysis ( 481). 

The solution obtained is evaporated down as far as pos- 
sible, to expel excess of acid, and is then diluted with water. 
In this manner we examine for copper, zinc, and lead, or 
also for iron and nickel. 

2. Enamelled or glazed vessels are nearly filled with 
acetic acid at 4 per cent., and the contents are boiled for 
half an hour; the liquid is then concentrated in a vessel 
free from lead, filtered if requisite, and treated with a 
current of sulphuretted hydrogen. 

In general we test merely for lead, which is shown accord- 
ing to 467. A precipitate formed consists of lead sulphide. 

Eilsinger asserts that in almost all enamels he has ob- 
tained a stanniferous solution on digestion for from six to 
eight hours in the cold with hydrochloric acid at 1 per cent, 
(detection according to 474). 

3. In the examination of water we simply evaporate 1 
litre or several litres of water down to about 200 cc. ( 197), 
with the addition of a little nitric acid. But in case of 
waters rich in organic matters, incineration is necessary, 
possibly with the addition of a little saltpetre. 

401. If the inorganic substances to be sought for are 
mixed with an abundance of organic matter, e.g., in clothing, 
paper, paper-hangings, toys, articles of food, &c., a mecha- 
nical separation may be first attempted. Thus layers of 



to be examined, we heat weighed pieces of the metal in dilute nitric acid as 
long as stannic acid is deposited. When this is effected the pieces are removed 
from the capsule and the contents are examined for tin and lead. The pro- 
portion of the two results enables the quantity of lead in the tin to be deter- 
mined. Examinations of the solder with which tins are closed up is trouble- 
some, as very little material is available. The only resource is careful scraping 
off with a knife. These investigations are important, since solder containing 
much lead is often used even when the cans are tinned with the finest tin. 



OBTAINING MATERIAL FOR EXAMINATION. 349 

colour may be scraped off from a measured surface, and thus 
the working up of the organic matter may be to a great 
degree obviated. The further separation of organic and 
inorganic substances is then effected 

a. By preparing extracts with water, acids, or alkalies, 
which, however, is chiefly advisable only in a preliminary 
search for certain substances, and should be omitted by 
beginners, unless there is abundance of material. But for a 
decision it is often very important to know whether elements 
are present in a soluble or an insoluble form; e.g., in the 
examination of textile fabrics for antimony and arsenic, as 
also in the search for barium, it must never be omitted to 
ascertain whether the poisons are soluble in water or dilute 
hydrochloric acid. 

The more experienced operator will often be able to obviate 
the more circumstantial methods I and c by a judicious 
selection and combination of solvents. 

&. By destroying the organic substance. 

1. According to the principles laid down in 210, the 
substance is burnt to ashes in a porcelain capsule. But anti- 
mony and arsenic may thus escape, at least in part, and also 
copper, mercury, and zinc may be partly volatilised by con- 
version into chlorides in presence of much sodium chloride. 
In order to avoid this loss the dried organic substance 
should be moistened with concentrated sulphuric acid before 
incineration, as copper and zinc sulphates are certainly not 
volatile. This method is very certain for all heavy metals 
except mercury, though the incineration is rendered more 
tedious. 

2. The organic substance, dried and finely powdered, or 
cut up extremely finely (from 1 to 10 grm.), is introduced 
in small portions into a capacious crucible containing melting- 
saltpetre in excess (i.e., so much that the melt always remains 
of a pale colour). This method is much to be recommended 
for articles of caoutchouc, and indeed for all the heavy 
metals except mercury. Even arsenic is not volatilised. 
Copper oxide is sometimes separated out as a grey turbidity, 
but almost all other substances are converted into com- 



35 ARTICLES OF USE. 

pounds soluble in water. Insoluble residues are : ferric 
oxide, lead sulphate, silicates, barium sulphate, and possibly 
silver chloride. In many cases it is practicable to use in- 
stead of saltpetre nitric acid, with which the substance is 
evaporated down in a porcelain capsule upon an asbestos 
plate. When the liquid is almost expelled there suddenly 
takes place a rather violent oxidation of the mass, sometimes 
attended with slight phenomena of combustion. By subse- 
quent repeated additions of small quantities of nitric acid 
we obtain a very rapid and convenient mineralisation. With 
copper, e.g., this method gives very good results. 

3. According to Fresenius and Von Babo we destroy the 
organic matter by means of nascent chlorine. Available for 
the determination of all metals, as well as arsenic, antimony, 
&c. The method is especially applicable to foods, animal 
organs, portions of dead bodies, &c. Liquids, beer, wine, &c., 
previously evaporated down to the consistence of a syrup 
(with an addition of soda), may be treated in this manner. 
Every trace of alcohol must be previously expelled. The 
substance, comminuted as finely as possible, is stirred up to 
a thick paste with much pure (free from arsenic) hydro- 
chloric acid. About 3 grin, potassium chlorate are added. 
The whole is then transferred to a roomy flask, which is 
closed with a caoutchouc stopper having two perforations. 
Through the one there passes a tube-funnel, cut off short, 
fitted with a cock, and filled with a saturated solution of 
potassium chlorate. Through the other enters an ascending- 
tube cut off below the stopper. The flask is allowed first to 
stand for about one hour at the temperature of the room, and 
is then heated upon an asbestos plate, very cautiously at first, 
but afterwards more boldly. After some time the solution 
of potassium chlorate is allowed to fall in drop by drop by 
opening the cock. 

The development of chlorine must be continuous, but 
never so strong that the gas above the level of the liquid 
shows a distinct yellowish-green colour. After a time it may 
become needful to add repeatedly more hydrochloric acid, 
but ultimately the liquid becomes pale yellow or yellowish- 



SYSTEMATIC SEPARATION AND DETECTION. 351 

brown, and only fats and derivatives of fats are suspended 
in it, and a few unchanged mineral constituents. After the 
funnel-cock has been replaced by a long elbow-tube, the 
dissolved chlorine is expelled by a current of washed car- 
bonic acid, and the liquid, which has lost the smell of 
chlorine, is filtered. 

A complete destruction of the organic substances, as it is required for 
any exact examination for metals, can be obtained by this method only 
with great difficulty, so that it can be recommended only when the 
other processes are inapplicable on account of volatilisation. 

There remain upon the filter, the contents of which must be re- 
peatedly boiled out with water, along with fats, and possibly cellulose : 
barium and lead sulphates (white), cinnabar (red), chromic oxide (green), 
silver chloride (white, but turning to a violet in light). Of these sub- 
stances, chromic oxide and cinnabar, which were present in an in- 
soluble state in the original material, have no hygienic interest. On 
the other hand, lead sulphate, barium sulphate, and silver chloride 
may have been formed from soluble compounds during the destruction 
of the organic substances. Sulphuric acid may be formed from the 
sulphur of the albumenoid substances and the sulphides. The filter 
with the residues from chlorination is burnt in a crucible. Lead 
sulphate is detected according to 467 ; barium sulphate and silicates 
as in 327, and silver chloride as in 465. 



2. Systematic Separation and Detection of the most 
Important Elements. 

462. The aqueous solution of the saltpetre melt, and 
also the solution in chlorine and hydrochloric acid, contains, 
with the few exceptions enumerated in the foregoing section, 
the elements which are hygienically important in their 
entirety : 

Antimony Chrome Mercury 

Arsenic Cobalt Tin 

Barium Copper Uranium 

Bismuth Lead Zinc 

Cadmium Nickel 

We must not omit in our considerations silver and iron ; 
silver because it may easily occur in our analyses in various 
alloys, and still more as a coating on metals of inferior value. 



352 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Iron is found in most every substance which has to be 
analysed ; manganese, as a constituent of the ash of many 
plants, must also be mentioned. 

We shall first give a short methodic process 1 for the 
detection and separation of the several elements enumerated 
above, a procedure which the beginner must always follow 
if the question is not merely the recognition of a given 
element ; in this latter case Chapter III. ( 467) will often 
greatly simplify the operation. The separation, according to 
the indications of these schemes, is quantitatively accurate ; 
if such a determination is required the elements, after 
separation, can be converted into the most convenient form, 
according to Chapter IV., 481. 

SCHEME I. 

463. If the solution contains no hydrochloric acid, a little is added, 
when silver is precipitated, as AgCl (see 465). Any lead chloride 
which accompanies the silver chloride may be removed by means of 
boiling water, when the plumbiferous solution is added to the filtrate. 
A precipitation of mercury as mercurous chloride need not be feared, 
on account of the previous treatment with chlorine (simple incineration 
and fusion with saltpetre are inadmissible in case of mercury ; see 
461). 

SCHEME II. 

464. We pass into the hydrochloric solution a current of sul- 
phuretted hydrogen free from arsenic ( 471) from a Kipp apparatus, 
shaking repeatedly, and continuing this treatment for thirty minutes to 
four hours. For shorter experiments we may use instead of a Kipp 
apparatus a simple flask with a cork having two perforations. Through 
the one aperture there passes a long vertical tube which plunges into 
the liquid, and the other a short gas-delivery tube. If the precipitation 
is supposed to be completed, we allow the beaker containing the pre- 
cipitate to remain for a time covered, and try if it has still a strong 
smell of sulphuretted hydrogen. If the odour has disappeared, the 
introduction of the gas must be continued. 

There are thus deposited arsenic, antimony, tin, mercury, lead, 
silver, bismuth, copper, and cadmium as sulphides, which may be 
separated after filtering and washing with hot distilled water. The 

1 For the following schemes, as well as the special reactions, the judicious 
work of Arnold (Kurze Anleituny zur qualitativcn Chemischen Analyse, 3rd 
edit., Hanover, 1890) has been largely taken as a foundation (in some parts 
verbatim). 



SYSTEMATIC SEPARATION AND DETECTION. 353 

filtrates and washings are poured together, and examined further accord- 
ing to Scheme III. 

The filter with the precipitated sulphides is placed in a capsule and 
heated with yellow ammonium sulphide ; filtered after a few minutes, 
the extraction is repeated, and the liquids thus obtained are poured 
together. 

A. The solution in ammonium sulphide contains arsenic, antimony, 
tin, and traces of copper in the form of sulpho-salts (e.g., ammonium 
sulpharseniate AsS/NH^g). 

It is evaporated to dryness, the dry residue is again evaporated to 
dryness with small portions of fuming nitric acid cautiously added 
until it becomes a light yellow, and a further addition of acid liberates 
no more red fumes. A few drops of pure soda-lye are added, the 
whole is ground up with a dry mixture of sodium carbonate and 
sodium nitrate (1:2), and the saline mixture when well dried is slowly 
melted (Meyer's flux) |TJ. 

The flux is dissolved or suspended in water, a current of carbonic 
acid is introduced, the liquid is filtered off from the undissolved sub- 
stances (sodium pyrantimoniate and tin oxide). The filtrate contains 
all the arsenic as sodium arseniate (As04Nas), for the further demon- 
stration of which compare 471 pT|. The insoluble compounds of 
tin and antimony are dried on the filter, incinerated in a porcelain 
crucible, and the ash is fused with potassium cyanide. The metals are 
thus reduced, and may be weighed. The tin pTj dissolves in a little 
hydrochloric acid ; the residue, consisting of metallic antimony [T|; dis- 
solves in hydrochloric acid with the addition of a little potassium 
chlorate, forming antimony chloride, and may be precipitated by 
sulphuretted hydrogen as orange-red antimony sulphide (see 473). 

B. The mercury, lead, copper, silver, bismuth, and cadmium sul- 
phides are insoluble in ammonium sulphide ; they are boiled with 
two-thirds concentrated nitric acid and one-third water. 

a. There remain undissolved : black = mercury sulphide, HgS ; soluble 

in aqua-regia (see 466) | jT|. 

yellowish grey flakes = sulphur. Burns

Formed in small quantities from 
lead sulphide on boiling in nitric

(b.) Lead, silver, bismuth, copper, and cadmium are dissolved and 
filtered off. 

The solution is rendered alkaline with ammonia, any precipitate 
formed being disregarded, and then rendered strongly acid with an 
excess of dilute sulphuric acid.

is reason to test for cadmium (in 
examining yellow colours), we intro- 
duce, in the absence of copper, a 
current of sulphuretted hydrogen, 
when yellow cadmium sulphide is 
precipitated pp. If copper is pre- 
sent its precipitation is prevented by 
adding potassium cyanide until the 
blue colour disappears (formation 
of potassium cupro- cyanide [CuCN, 
KCN]). After precipitating and 
filtering off the cadmium the copper 
is precipitated with soda-lye 



SCHEME III. 

The nitrate from the sulphuretted hydrogen precipitate is mixed 
with much ammonia and solution of ammonium chloride, and then 
with yellow ammonium sulphide. The precipitate filtered off may 
contain :

As Sulphides.

For separation the filter, still moist, having been washed with ammo- 
nium sulphide, is placed along with the precipitate in a cold mixture 
of one volume concentrated hydrochloric acid, and five volumes water. 

A. There dissolve as chlorides: chromium, iron, aluminium, man- 
ganese, zinc ; barium (calcium) and phosphoric acid, if present, pass also 
into solution. The filtrate is boiled to expel the hydrogen sulphide, 
and the flocks of sulphur are filtered off. Two preliminary tests are 
made, each with a small aliquot part of the measured liquid. 

1. For chrome, by evaporating down and melting with soda and 
saltpetre, as in 461. If chromium is abundant, the change of colour- 
on introducing the sulphuretted hydrogen will have attracted attention, 
the yellow passing into a green ( 463). 

2. For phosphoric acid : by addition of concentrated nitric acid and 
ammonium molybdate ( 1 85). 

If chromium is present it is separated as follows : The solution is 



SYSTEMATIC SEPARATION AND DETECTION. 355 



mixed with bromine water (distilled water in which bromine has been 
dissolved until the colour is a deep brown), supersaturated with sodium 
carbonate, gently heated and filtered when the liquid has become a 
pure yellow (no longer green). The filtrate contains all the chrome 
as sodium chromate ; by heating with alcohol and hydrochloric acid 
the chromate is reduced to chromium chloride, and precipitated with 
ammonia ( 478) as greyish green chromium hydroxide Cr 2 (OH) 6 jjT|. 

If no chrome is present, or when the sodium carbonate precipitate, 
after removal of the chrome, has been dissolved in concentrated nitric 
acid, the phosphoric acid is separated. For this purpose the liquid is 
boiled with an excess of the purest tin. There is formed a precipitate 
consisting chiefly of tin phosphate [Sn 3 (P04)4] and tin hydroxide 
[Sn(OH) 2 ], along with a little accompanying iron phosphate and alu- 
minium phosphate. The washed precipitate is freed from tin (as tin 
sulphide) and phosphoric acid (as ammonium phosphate) by digestion 
for two hours with ammonium sulphide ; the accompanying ferrous 
sulphide and aluminium hydroxide remain undissolved ; after solution 
in nitric acid they are added to the filtrate from the tin precipitate pTf. 

When the phosphoric acid has been removed ammonia and ammo- 
nium chloride are added in excess. 



1. The precipitate consists of 
ferric hydroxide and aluminium 
hydroxide. It is quickly filtered 
off ITsl. For separating iron and 
aluminium dissolve in a little 
hydrochloric acid and precipitate 
ferric hydroxide Fe 2 (OH) 6 by boil- 
ing with excess of soda-lye Q^j. 
The filtrate is acidified with hy- 
drochloric acid, and the alumina 
is precipitated by adding ammonia 
in excess, and boiling until the 
liquid no longer smells of ammo- 
nia. The precipitate is aluminium 
hydroxide, A1 2 (OH) 6 QT|. 



2. The filtrate contains zinc and 
manganese. It is acidified with 
acetic acid, and treated with sul- 
phuretted hydrogen. A white 
precipitate zinc sulphide, ZnS QeJ. 

3. The filtrate from 2 mixed 
with ammonia and ammonium 
sulphide yields a precipitate of 
manganese sulphide, which, ac- 
cording to quantity and purity, 
may be yellowish, flesh-coloured, 
or greenish p7|. If phosphoric 
acid was originally present, bar- 
ium^v^ may be present in the 
filtrate, which must be remembered 
during the examination. For re- 
actions, see end of 481. 



B. A black, undissolved residue consists of nickel and cobalt. 

Qualitative Recognition. We dissolve in a little aqua-regia ; evaporate 
almost to dryness and divide into two portions. The one-half is mixed 
with potassium cyanide until the precipitate formed is redissolved, and 
then heated to boiling, adding excess of soda-lye and bromine-water. 
On heating, if nickel is present, black nickel-oxide, is precipitated 
(Ni 2 3 )|jF|. The other half is boiled with a fragment of caustic 
potassa, when a blue colour indicates cobalt 1*2(7 1. 

For quantitative separation and determination, see 481.

3. Special Reactions of the Elements of 
Hygienic Importance. 

1. SILVER. 

465. 1. Hydrochloric acid precipitates white flocculent .silver 
chloride (AgCl), which turns brown or violet on exposure to light 
(separation of metallic silver), and dissolves readily in ammonia or 
potassium cyanide. 

2. In neutral liquids, potassium chromate precipitates brownish-red 
silver chromate (AggOQi). 

3. Sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonium sulphide precipitate black 
silver sulphide, soluble in hot nitric acid (AgS). 

2. MERCURY. 

466. Upon sheet copper or brass (brass wool) mercury 
is deposited from neutral or slightly acid solutions (even in 
presence of many organic substances, c.y., in urine) on shak- 
ing or prolonged standing, as a greyish-white coating which 
on friction becomes silvery white, and disappears if slightly 
heated. The brass wool, after being rinsed in water and 
alcohol and being dried, is heated in a tube of sparingly 
fusible glass, and the sublimation of the mercury is ob- 
served. The reaction is not interfered with by the simul- 
taneous presence of iron, lead, zinc, antimony, arsenic ; silver 
also gives a grey but not volatile coating. A trace of iodine 
vapour turns the grey coating to a reddish-yellow. (See 
136.) 

2. From mercuric salts potassium iodide precipitates scar- 
let mercuric iodide (HgI 2 ), and from mercurous salts a 
greenish-yellow mercurous iodide (Hg 2 I 2 ), both soluble in 
excess of potassium iodide. 

3. Sulphuretted hydrogen or ammonium sulphide precipitates mer- 
curic salts, first whitish, then yellowish, and lastly black. The HgS 
formed is insoluble in hydrochloric or nitric acid, but readily soluble 
in aqua-regia. In the mercurous salts sulphuretted hydrogen produces 
at once a precipitate of black HgS, which encloses metallic mercury 
in a state of fine division, and which is easily soluble in nitric acid. 
Yellow ammonium sulphide converts it entirely into black HgS. 



SPECIAL REACTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS. 357 



3. LEAD. 

467. 1. Sulphuric acid precipitates (completely only on 
addition of alcohol) white lead sulphate (PbS0 4 ), insoluble 
in water and acids, soluble in potassa-lye and basic ammo- 
nium tartrate (the latter reaction distinguishes it from 
barium sulphate). 

2. Hydrochloric acid precipitates white lead chloride 
(PbCl 2 ), but only from concentrated solution ; it dissolves 
readily in much water, especially if heated (AgCl is insoluble 
in water). It is insoluble in ammonia. 

3. Potassium chromate precipitates yellow lead chromate 
(PbO0 4 ) from a neutral, an acetic, or a slightly nitric solu- 
tion; potassa-lye converts it into the red basic chromate 
(PbO + PbCr0 4 ) ; it dissolves in an excess of potassa-lye, 
especially if heated. 

4. Potassium iodide precipitates yellow lead iodide (PbI 2 ). 

5. Sulphuretted hydrogen or ammonium sulphide pre- 
cipitates black lead sulphide (PbS); in presence of much 
free hydrochloric acid the precipitate is first red (PbCl 2 + 
PbS), but is gradually entirely converted into PbS. Lead 
sulphide gradually dissolves in hot dilute nitric acid to Pb 
(N0 3 ) 2 ; if very concentrated nitric acid is used a little 
insoluble lead sulphate is formed at the same time (see 1). 

4. COPPER. 

468. 1. An excess of liquid ammonia colours a solution 
of copper blue after in many cases a greenish-blue precipitate 
of a basic salt has been first produced. Potassa- and soda- 
lye precipitate blue copper hydroxide [Cu(OH) 2 ], which if 
boiled passes into black copper oxide (CuO), and is soluble 
in NH 3 . 

2. A red deposit of copper is deposited upon bright iron 
(knife-blades, needles), even from very dilute acid solutions 
of copper. This reaction is interfered with by the presence 
of silver, mercury, and antimony, but not by iron, lead, tin, 
zinc, and arsenic. 



358 ARTICLES OF USE. 

3. Potassium ferrocyanide precipitates reddish - brown 
copper ferrocyanide (Cu 9 FeC 6 N 6 ), insoluble in dilute acids ; 
very small quantities may be detected by a red-brown 
colour. 

4. Sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonium sulphide pre- 
cipitate black copper sulphides, whether the solution has 
an acid or an alkaline reaction. The sulphide is easily 
soluble in hot nitric acid. 

5. CADMIUM. 

469. Sulphuretted hydrogen or ammonium sulphide precipitates 
yellow cadmium sulphide, which, unlike the two other yellow sulphides 
(As-jSa and Sn-_>S.V>, is insoluble in ammonium sulphide, but easily soluble 
in hot nitric acid. 

6. BISMUTH. 

470. 1. Sulphuretted hydrogen or ammonium sulphide precipitates 
brownish-black bismuth sulphide (Bi 2 S 3 ) easily soluble in hot nitric 
acid. 

A solution of stannous chloride in soda-lye precipitates black 
bismuthous oxide (BiO). 

3. All solutions of bismuth compounds which do not contain too 
large a quantity of free acid are decomposed by a plentiful addition 
of water, a white basic salt being precipitated (e.cj. : BiCl 3 + H 2 = 
BiOCl + 2HC1). 

Tartaric acid does not prevent the precipitation by water (a distinc- 
tion from antimony). An excess of potassa- or soda-lye does not render 
clear solutions of bismuth which have been made turbid by the 
addition of water ; there is formed Bi(OH) :! bismuth hydroxide. (Dif- 
ference from stannous salts.) 

4. Potassium cliromate precipitates yellow bismuth chromate, easily 
soluble in dilute nitric acid, insoluble in potassa-lye. (Difference from 
lead chromate.) 

7. ARSENIC. 

471. The distinction between arsenious acid (As 2 3 ) and 
arsenic acid (As 2 O.) is unimportant for hygiene, as the latter 
acts physiologically like the former, though more slowly. It 
is, therefore, sufficient if we detect arsenic in either form. 

In consequence of the delicacy of arsenic tests employed, 
blank experiments must always be made beforehand to 
check the reagents sold as free fr,om arsenic (zinc, acids, 



SPECIAL KEACTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS. 359 

&C.) 1 ; i.e., no tests can be accepted as valid if they succeed 
with the reagents alone. 

As the material for the detection of arsenic we take either 
scrapings of colour or extracts with concentrated ammonia 
filtered and evaporated down (Gutzeit and Fliickiger). 
Dragendorff recommends that the finely comminuted sub- 
stance should be first evaporated down to dryness in a 
porcelain capsule on the water-bath with nitric acid (of 
specific gravity, 14), then placed in a boiling flask and 
extracted for two hours. To 100 scm. of wall-paper or 200 
scm. of woven tissue there is used at first 50 cc. of nitric 
acid, and then as much sulphuric acid. It is, of course, 
most accurate to use the sulphuretted hydrogen precipitate 
from Fresenius-Babo's digestion after its oxidation (Meyer's 
Flux, 464 A). 

For preliminary investigations it is sufficient to use paper- 
hangings, textile goods, &c., directly if the proportion of 
arsenic is appreciable. 

1. The substance in question (tissue, paper, pigment) is 
placed in a test-glass, covered with dilute sulphuric acid, 
a piece of zinc, free from arsenic, about the size of a pea 
is dropped in, the glass is closed with a perforated caoutchouc 
stopper, through which there passes a tube drawn out to a 
point, and the escaping hydrogen mixed with arsenic hydride 
is ignited as soon as we are sure that all the atmospheric air 
has been expelled. On& or several cold lids of porcelain 
crucibles must be moved slowly over the flame, when 
brownish or blackish spots (" mirrors ") are formed and 
are further examined ( 472). As small a quantity as T Jo 
myrm. may thus be detected. 

2. Gutzeit' s Reaction. We pour into a capacious test-glass 
3 cc. hydrochloric acid and 6 cc. water, mixed with a little 
iodised potassium iodide, until the colour becomes yellow ; 
a little zinc is added, a stopper of cotton-wool is quickly 



1 The physician will be rarely required to prepare his own reagents (see 
Baurnert), but he s'lould always test them. Barium sulphide for the prepara- 
tion of pure hydrogen sulphide may now be bought.

thrust into the upper section of the tube, and a piece of 
white blotting-paper, moistened with a drop of concentrated 
solution of silver nitrate (1 nitrate -f 2 water) is laid over 
the mouth. There then appears a lemon-yellow spot (Ag 3 As 
+ 3AgN0 3 ) with a brownish margin, which becomes at 
once black if moistened with water (separation of silver). 
The reaction (for details see 472) must be produced in the 
absence of direct sunlight. If the proportion of arsenic is 
very small, i.e., if the reaction does not at once appear, the 
glass is placed in a shut-up closet, from which it is taken 
out for examination every five or ten minutes. In a blank 
experiment no yellow colour should appear in thirty minutes. 
100 w0r???. arsenic is very distinct, and ToVo~ wgrm. can s ^^ 
be recognised after some time. At the same time the odour 
of garlic is observed. The filter-paper should not have been 
kept in the laboratory for any length of time, as substances 
may be taken up, especially from coal-gas, which, without 
containing arsenic, may simulate its reactions (Curtmann, 
Cliem. Zeit. Repertorium, 1891, p. 82). 

3. An analogous reaction (although sufficiently sensitive 
for sanitary purposes, and not affected by light and water) 
is obtained by using a solution of mercuric chloride (1'20) 
instead of the silver solution, the procedure being otherwise 
quite similar. Arsenic is shown by a yellow colour which 
becomes brown. 

4. Bettendorfs Reaction. The suspected substance is dissolved in 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, and a piece of the purest tin-foil is 
added. In presence of arsenic there appears a brown coloration, or the 
separation of brown flocks, which consist of stanniferous arsenic. The 
method is much recommended for examining the " non-arsenical " 
hydrochloric acid. Instead of tin a pasty solution of stannous chloride 
in concentrated hydrochloric acid is frequently used, saturated with 
washed hydrochloric gas, and filtered through asbestos. The German 
Arzneibnch (Pharmacopoeia Germanica?) requires that no brown colour 
should appear in an hour. (Bettendorf's reaction ; for a criticism of 
this reaction see Chem. Zeit. Re-pert., 1890, p. 352, and 1891, pp. 33 
and 256.) 

The chief objection to Bettendorffs reagent is that it has in itself a 
yellowish colour, and that a series of non-arsenical substances acetates, 
phosphates, glycerine, calcium phosphates, &c. produce a slight dark 
coloration. 



SPECIAL REACTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS. 361 

The chief method for an exact qualitative determination 
is still that of Marsh, which must therefore be briefly de- 
scribed. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 126. 

Into the gas-generating flask there plunges an open funnel- 
tube; b is a tube filled with calcium chloride to retain 
water ; the tube c, d, e is made of sparingly fusible potash 
glass about 7 mm. internal diameter by drawing it out in 
some places to a diameter of from 1 to 1J mm. internal 
width. Into the flask a there are put about 10 grm. zinc 
free from arsenic, and from 10 to 15 per cent, of pure hydro- 
chloric or sulphuric acid, so that a slow current of hydro-

gen is evolved. 1 We wait for thirty minutes until all the 
air is expelled, and heat then for one hour, keeping up a 
gentle current of gas. Heat is applied in one, or in a second 
place immediately in front of a contraction of the tube 
(Fig. 126). If arsenic is present it appears in the contracted 
parts as a brownish, blackish, or black coating. 

When the reagents have been found free from arsenic the 
flask is almost entirely emptied, fresh zinc is introduced, if 
needful, and after the air has been expelled (in about fifteen 
minutes) the substance in question is dissolved in hydro- 



1 The purer the zinc the slower is the current, but it may be accelerated 
by platinising the zinc before the experiment. For this purpose the frag- 
ments of zinc are covered with dilute sulphuric acid, and a couple of drops of 
platinum chloride are added. As soon as the escape of gas becomes violent 
the zinc is removed from the liquid, washed, and dried. 



362 ARTICLES OF USE. 

chloric acid, is poured in slowly, and in portions through the 
funnel-tube. 1 

As in the preliminary experiment we endeavour to obtain 
several deposits of arsenic (mirrors), for which a very short 
time is sufficient if the proportion of arsenic is not quite a 
minimum. The escaping gas is then lighted at g (Fig. 126), 
and some cold lids of porcelain crucibles are held in the 
flame, which, if arsenic is present, has a bluish white colour. 
Arsenical spots are again formed. Finally the flame may be 
extinguished, and the gas passed into a solution of silver 
nitrate, slightly acidified with nitric acid. The liquid be- 
comes turbid from the deposition of silver, and after filtra- 
tion takes a yellow colour 011 the addition of ammonia drop 
by drop. 

The conditions for the success of Marsh's reaction are the 
slow, uniform development of the gas, the absence of oxidising 
agents, and substances which yield sulphuretted hydrogen. 

472. Although by preparing Meyer's flux ( 464a), we 
may in every important case exclude from the outset the 
possibility of confounding the arsenical spots with those of 
antimony, since no antimony enters into solution, we test 
each time for the most important reactions of antimony 
according to the following conspectus : 

DISTINCTION OF ARSENIC AND ANTIMONY BY MEANS OF THE 
MARSH APPARATUS. 

A rtenic. Antimon ij. 

AsH 3 has a strong smell of garlic. SbH 3 is inodorous. 



AsH 3 burns with a bluish white

1 Dragendorff recommends the 50 cc. of arsenical maceration liquid to be 
introduced at once, and that heat should be applied at once (after shaking up 
the flask) for exactly ten minutes, to the place in front of the first contraction 
of the reduction tube. See 485. 



SPECIAL REACTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS.

Arsenic. 

AsH 3 + 6 AgN0 3 + H 2 = 6 Ag + 
6N0 3 H + AsH 3 3 . 

When the filtrate is neutralised 
with ammonia yellow Ag 3 As0 3 is 
deposited. 

Arsenical spots only behind the 
heated place, shining brownish 
black or brown ; volatile if heated 
in a current of hydrogen ; garlic 
smell. 

Soluble without colour in a 
solution of sodium hypochlorite. 1 

In contact with iodine vapour, 
the spot gradually changes into 
yellowish brown arsenious iodide, 
which is decolorised if breathed 
upon. If a drop of strong sul- 
phuretted hydrogen water is then 
applied to the spot yellow arsenic 
sulphide is formed. 



Antimony. 

SbH + 3 AgNOs = Ag 3 Sb + 3 
N0 3 H. 

If the precipitate is dissolved in 
tartaric acid it yields with sulphu- 
retted hydrogen orange red anti- 
mony sulphide. 

Antimonial spots : partly before 
the heated place. Velvet black ; 
not readily volatile if heated in a 
current of hydrogen ; inodorous. 

Not affected by sodium hypo- 
chlorite. 

On similar treatment there is 
formed reddish brown antimoni- 
ous iodide which does not dis- 
appear if breathed upon. It is 
changed into orange red antimony 
sulphide by a drop of strong sul- 
phuretted hydrogen water. 



8. ANTIMONY. 

473. 1. A white basic salt is thrown down from solution 
of antimonial salts by an excess of water. Tartaric acid 
dissolves the precipitate or prevents its formation (distinc- 
tion from bismuth). 

2. If no free nitric acid is present, antimony in a hydro- 
chloric solution, placed in the concavity of a platinum lid, 
can be deposited upon the platinum as a brown or black 
coating by means of metallic zinc. The spot is insoluble in 
hydrochloric acid, easily soluble in nitric acid. 

3. Sulphuretted hydrogen precipitates orange-red anti- 
monious sulphide (Sb 2 S 3 ), or antimonic sulphide (Sb 2 S 5 ), 
soluble in ammonium sulphide. 

4. It is best recognised in the Marsh apparatus, like 
arsenic, from which it must have been previously separated, 
as in 464. For its distinction from arsenic, see 472. 



1 Sodium hypochlorite is obtained by rubbing up chloride of lime with 
soda-l}e and filtering the liquid, which is slightly alkaline.

9. TIN. 

474. 1. Nitric acid with heat separates out white meta- 
stannic acid (H 9 Sn0 3 ), which on ignition passes into stannic 
oxide Sn0 2 . 

2. Metallic zinc precipitates tin from a hydrochloric solution. The 
black deposit of tin does not adhere to platinum as does antimony. 

3. If salts of tin are suspended in a bead of phosphatic salt, moistened 
with solution of cobalt nitrate, and held in the oxidising flame of the 
Bunsen burner, the melt takes on ignition a bluish green colour (see 
Cobalt). 

4. Sulphuretted hydrogen precipitates from the stannous salts a 
brownish black stannous sulphide (SnS), but from the stannic salts 
yellow stannic sulphide (SnS 2 ), both soluble in ammonium sulphide, 
or in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid. 

10. IRON. 

475. 1. Ferrous salts take a deep blue colour (Turnbull'. 
blue Fe 3 (FeC G N G ) 2 ) with potassium ferricyanide and hydro- 
chloric acid ; but take no colour with potassium sulpho- 
cyanide. 

2. Ferric salts take a deep blue with potassium ferro- 
cyanide and hydrochloric acid [Prussian blue Fe 4 (FeC 6 N 6 ) 3 ] ; 
potassium sulpho-cyanide gives a blood-red colour [formation 
of Fe 2 (CXS) 6 ]. 

3. Sodium acetate gives a dark red colour with formation of ferric 
acetate ; on boiling with an excess of sodium acetate, all the iron is 
precipitated as basic iron acetate Fe^OH^CaHsO.,^ + 4 C.>H 4 0... 



4. Ferrous and ferric salts give black precipitates with 
ammonium sulphide, but not with sulphuretted hydrogen in 
acid solution. 

11. COBALT. 1 

476. Very small quantities of cobalt salts, if melted in a loop of 
platinum wire, colour melted phosphatic salt or borax (a so-called 
bead) a splendid blue. 

2. Salts of cobalt mixed with an excess of potassium cyanide, and a 
little yellow ammonium sulphide, take a blood-red colour. Further 
reactions in Scheme III. | 20 |. 



1 In the separation of nickel and cobalt ( 481) a series of reactions of these 
metals are described. 



SPECIAL REACTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS. 365 

12. NICKEL. 

477. Potassa- and soda-lye precipitate pale green nickel hydroxide 
Ni(OH) 2 , insoluble in an excess of the solvent. 

No characteristic coloration of the borax bead. Further reactions 
in Scheme III. [ 10 |. 

13. CHROME. 

478. 1. Chromium oxide salts are entirely precipitated 
by ammonia on ebullition; the precipitate [chromium 
hydroxide O 2 (OH) 6 ] is greyish green ; the supernatant 
liquid is at first green or reddish violet, but becomes colour- 
less when the precipitation is completed. 

2. If we melt compounds of chromic oxide with potassium 
nitrate and soda, there is formed potassium chromate, 
K 2 Cr0 4 giving a yellowish solution in water, which forms 
a yellow precipitate with lead acetate (PbCr0 4 ) (compare 
| 467). If boiled with hydrochloric acid and alcohol, a 
greenish solution of chromium chloride is formed precipitable 
as in 1. 

3. For detecting traces of chromic acid the solution is 
concentrated as much as possible, and dropped into a dilute 
acidified (sulphuric acid) solution of hydrogen peroxide, 
upon which floats a thin stratum of ether. The blue 
coloration formed in the lower stratum passes over to the 
ether if slightly shaken. See 132. 

14. ZINC. 

479. 1. Zinc salts, if moistened with cobalt nitrate and 
ignited upon wood charcoal, yield, without melting, masses 
of a fine green colour (Einmann's green). 

2. Sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonium sulphide pre- 
cipitate white zinc sulphide (ZnS) from acetic, neutral, or 
alkaline solutions of zinc, but not from a hydrochloric liquid. 

15. MANGANESE. 

480. 1. If manganese is fused upon platinum foil with soda and a 
little saltpetre, there is formed a bluish green mass (sodium man- 
ganate Na 2 Mn0 4 ). 



3 66 ARTICLES OF USE. 

2. If red lead is heated with an excess of nitric acid, and there is 
added a trace of manganese salt, or a liquid (free from ammonium 
chloride) to be tested for manganese, the liquid assumes an intense 
purple red colour, due to the formation of permanganic acid. Thn 
colour becomes more distinct after the excess of the red lead has 
subsided. 

3. Ammonium sulphide precipitates a hydrated yellowish - white 
manganese sulphide (MnS), which in large quantities appears of a 
flesh colour, and becomes brown on drying. Sometimes the flesh- 
coloured precipitate becomes converted into the green, anhydrous 
.sulphide even in the cold, or more rapidly if boiled. 

4. The Quantitative Determination of the most 
Important Elements. 

(.) GENERAL METHODS. 

481. 1. Electrolytic Separation as a Metal. If a moder- 
ately strong galvanic current is passed through a dilute nitric 
solution of certain metals, silver and copper are deposited at 
the positive electrode (platinode) as metals, and lead peroxide 
at the negative electrode, in a form which, after desiccation, 
admits of direct weighing. Mercury, zinc, nickel, and other 
metals can be thus determined, but the methods which 
also require special arrangements are neither so necessary 
nor so general in hygienic work as to require here a par- 
ticular description. See 

CLASSEN, A., Quantitative chemische Analyse (lurch EleJctrolyse. 3rd 
edit. Berlin. 1892. 

2. Weighing as Sulphide. The sulphides obtained from a 
great number of metals, by precipitation with sulphuretted 
hydrogen, are not adapted for weighing, as they become 
partially oxidised whilst drying ; mercury sulphide forms an 
exception. To avoid this defect they are heated (after the 
sulphuretted hydrogen precipitates have been heated in a 
crucible of Berlin porcelain, along with the filter, until the 
latter is completely consumed) with powdered roll-sulphur 
free from ash (about 3 to 5 gnn.\ in a current of hydrogen 
in a Rose crucible. A Eose crucible is made of unglazecl 
porcelain, and has a perforated lid, through which a porcelain 



QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF ELEMENTS. 367 

tube is introduced. After a strong current of hydrogen 
(dried by a passage through concentrated sulphuric acid) 
has been passed in, the crucible is heated, when the hydrogen 
takes fire. After about thirty minutes, when the sulphur is 
consumed, the substance is allowed to cool in a current of 
hydrogen, and weighed as sulphide. This method is well 
suited for copper, lead, and zinc. 

3. The hydroxides or oxides are precipitated by boiling 
with potassa-lye or ammonia, filtered off, dried, and con- 
verted into oxides by ignition. This procedure is available, 
e.g., for copper, iron, nickel, chrome. 

4. The oxides or sulphides are reduced to the metallic 
state by ignition in a current of hydrogen (Eose's crucible), 
e.g., silver, cobalt, nickel, copper (compare 219). 

5. The majority of metals, when present only in small 
quantities, may be approximately determined by colori- 
metric methods, founded on their most sensitive colour 
reactions. See, e.g., a colorimetric determination of iron, 
195. 

(6.) SPECIAL METHODS. 

Silver. Precipitate as silver chloride with hydrochloric acid, stirring 
well ; allow it to subside in the dark, filter, detach the precipitate from 
the paper, ignite, and weigh as AgCl. Any portion which still adheres 
to the filter is dissolved in a minimum of nitric acid after the paper 
has been burnt, precipitated with hydrochloric acid, washed by decanta- 
tion, united with the bulk, fused along with the latter in a porcelain 
crucible, and weighed as AgCl. 

Mercury. As mercuric sulphide HgS, direct as it is obtained 
according to Scheme II. |1T|, after it has been freed from lead sulphate 
by treatment with ammonium tartrate, and from any adhering sulphur 
by treatment with carbon disulphide. It is dried on weighed filter at 
100, and weighed. Mercuric chloride is soluble in ether. 

Lead. 1. Very small quantities may be determined colorimetrically 
as lead sulphide. We make a solution of 0-160 grm. lead nitrate in 
1 litre, i.e., O'l mgrm. lead per cubic centimetre as a comparative solu- 
tion, and add one or several cubic centimetres to portions of 100 cc. 
water, adding to each 5 cc. of soda-lye free from iron, and 5 cc. of strong 
sulphuretted hydrogen water. The same is done with the solution of 
lead in question made up to 100 cc., and the brownish-black shades 
of colour are compared. On the addition of alkali as little as 0-01 
mgrm. may be recognised in 100 cc. by the brownish colour. The 
filters must of course be free from iron. 



368 ARTICLES OF USE. 

2. Larger quantities are determined as lead sulphide according to 
481, 2, or : 

3. The lead sulphide is dissolved in nitric acid of a moderate degree 
of concentration, evaporating off the greater part of the acid ; the 
liquid is diluted with water, filtered, and the lead is precipitated as 
lead sulphate by means of sulphuric acid in presence of alcohol. 

Copper. 1. Very small quantities may be determined colorimetrically 
as copper ferrocyanide. A solution is prepared by dissolving T971 grm, 
copper sulphate (CuS0 4 + 5H 2 0) in 1 litre. Of this 1 cc. = 0'5 mgrm. 
copper. 100 cc. of water are mixed with varying proportions of this 
solution, and to each of these, as well as to the cupriferous liquid made 
up to 100 cc., there is added 1 cc. of a dilute solution of potassium ferro- 
cyanide. The solutions must be so weak as to give merely colorations, 
but not precipitates. 0*1 mgrm. is thus distinctly shown in 100 cc. The 
presence of nitric acid interferes. 

2. Copper may also be determined colorimetrically with ammonia as 
blue cupric oxide ammonia. This method has the advantage that the 
copper can be afterwards determined in any other manner, as the 
addition of ammonia, unlike that of potassium ferrocyanide, does not 
interfere with other reactions. 

3. Electrolytically (commencement of 481). 

4. By boiling with an excess of potassa-lye as copper oxide (same ). 
The black cupric oxide must not be ignited along with the filter. 

5. Yolumetrically, as copper sulphate. Cupriferous precipitates are 
dissolved in nitric acid, the copper nitrate after the abundant addition 
of ammonium sulphate is evaporated to dryness, and further heated 
upon an asbestos plate, when ammonium nitrate is volatilised and 
copper sulphate is formed. The copper sulphate is dissolved in water 
with 10 cc. of a colourless saturated solution of potassium iodide, when 
iodine is disengaged and copper iodide is formed 

CuS0 4 + 2KI = Cul + K 2 S0 4 + I. 

The free I is titrated with decinormal sodium thiosulphate (according 
to 135) ; as often as 1 cc. of this solution is consumed 12'57 mgrm. 
iodine are recognised = G'3 mgrm. copper. (I have often used with 
advantage this method by de Hab'n.) 

Arsenic. 1 1. We supersaturate the filtrate from Meyer's flux with 
ammonia, add magnesia mixture, collect on a small filter the precipitate, 
which is deposited on standing for twenty-four hours in the cold 
(ammonium magnesium arseniate), wash with very dilute ammonia, 
and proceed exactly as directed in 190 for the treatment of ammo- 
ium magnesium phosphate. The magnesium pyr-arseniate ultimately 
obtained by ignition contains 48'41 per cent, of arsenic. 

2. Mayrhofer has recently proposed to convert the arsenic into arsenic 
hydride, to conduct it into an acidified standard solution of silver 

1 The German official method (Bauaiert) is scarcely used on account of 
its tediousness. 



QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF ELEMENTS. 369 

nitrate and determine the loss of strength in the latter, occasioned 
by the precipitation of metallic silver by the arsenic hydride. The 
titration is effected as according to Volhard with potassium sulpho- 
cyanide. See Benefit iiber die VII. Versammlung Bayr. Chem. in Speyer, 
1888, p. 141. 

Antimony. 1. We weigh the metallic antimony contained according 
to 464, A. |T]. 

2. Or we precipitate the metallic antimony from the precipitate of 
antimony sulphide (dissolved in hydrochloric acid with the addition of 
a little potassium chlorate) by the introduction of pure metallic iron 
(binding- wire). The blackish metal deposited is collected on a weighed 
filter, washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, and afterwards with water, 
dried in the filter, and weighed. 

Tin. On dissolving alloys in nitric acid tin remains perfectly in- 
soluble as white metastannic acid (Sn0 3 H 2 ). When filtered, ignited, 
moistened with nitric acid, and again ignited, it becomes tin oxide 
(Sn0 2 ), in which state it is weighed. 

Iron. 1. Small quantities colorimetrically, according to 195. 

2. Larger quantities are precipitated as ferric hydroxide, according to 
Scheme III. fiT|, and converted into ferric oxide by ignition in a porce- 
lain crucible. 

3. The volumetric process is also convenient. We boil the iron 
hydroxide in a flask with zinc and sulphuric acid, without removal of 
alumina, whereby there is formed greenish ferrous hydroxide. The 
reduction is complete when a drop of the solution is no longer reddened 
by a solution of potassium sulphocyanide. 

We now dissolve 1*5 arm. potassium permanganate in 1 litre, and 
ascertain its standard by a fresh solution of dry, well-crystallised 
ferrous ammonium sulphate, of which 700 grm. are dissolved in 1 litre. 
Such a solution contains per litre exactly 1 grm. iron in the ferrous 
state. It consumes for oxidation exactly as much oxygen as a solution 
containing 1 % 125 grm. oxalic acid, which may also be used instead of 
the ferrous ammonium sulphate. We mix 50 cc. of the oxalic acid, or 
ferrous ammonium sulphate solution, with an excess of sulphuric acid, 
and add now (after heating to ebullition if oxalic acid has been used) 
permanganate solution until a permanent reddening appears. We use 
about 46 cc. 

In titrating our reduced solution of iron, which we decant away from 
the zinc without filtering, and titrate as rapidly as possible without heat- 
ing, the consumption of each 46 cc. solution of permanganate signifies 
50 mgrm. of iron. More dilute solutions can be used for very small 
quantities of iron. Compare 195. 

Aluminium. The alumina, A1 2 (OH) 6 , which has been precipitated, 
is ignited, weighed as AlgOg, Scheme III. |U|. If iron is present the 
mixture A1 2 3 + Fe 2 8 is weighed according to Scheme III. |TT|, the 
iron is titrated as above, recalculated as Fe 2 03, and deducted. The 
remainder is A1 2 3 . 

Cobalt and Nickel. If only one of these metals is present in the 

VOL. II. 2 A 



370 ARTICLES OF USE. 

mixture thrown down by sulphuretted hydrogen, according to Scheme 
III. 1 19 1 and |2o|, we proceed as follows : 

1. Nickel. Dissolve in hydrochloric acid, heat with an excess of 
soda-lye almost to ebullition in a porcelain basin, wash the apple-green 
nickelous hydroxide very well out by decantation, filter, dry, incinerate 
apart from the filter, and weigh after ignition as nickelous oxide (NiO). 

2. Cobalt. We proceed at first as above, but we avoid a great excess 
of soda-lye, and boil until brownish-black cobalt oxide separates out ; 
filter, wash very well, ignite with the filter, and then convert it into 
metallic cobalt in a Rose crucible in a current of hydrogen, but without 
the addition of sulphur. 

If both metals are simultaneously present they are jointly precipi- 
tated with soda-lye, converted together into metals in a Rose crucible, 
without the addition of sulphur, and weighed. They are dissolved in 
aqua-regia, neutralised with potassa-lye, a concentrated solution of potas- 
sium nitrite is added in excess, as also a little acetic acid. If the pre- 
cipitation is complete after standing for twenty-four hours in a warm 
place, we collect the yellow cobalt potassium nitrite (Co^NO^oKe) upon 
a filter, wa.sli with dilute sodium acetate (1 : 9) and potassium nitrite, 
incinerate the desiccated filter along with its contents, dissolve in 
hydrochloric acid, precipitate cobalt hydroxide with KOH as above, 
and convert it according to 2 into cobalt capable of being weighed. 
Cobalt + nickel - cobalt = nickel. 

Chrome. Soluble salts of chromium oxide are boiled in a porcelain 
capsule with an excess of ammonia, according to 478 ; the chromium 
hydroxide separated out is converted into chromic oxide, Cr 2 3 , by 
ignition in a porcelain crucible. Chromic acid and its salts are pre- 
viously reduced according to 464 JTTj. 

Zinc. 1. Very small quantities of zinc are determined colorimetrically. 
For this purpose 4'415 grin, zinc sulphate (ZnS0 4 + 7HoO) are dissolved 
in 1 litre (i.e., 1 rngrni. zinc in 1 cc.), and 100 cc. of water are mixed 
with varying proportions of this solution. Largely diluted solutions 
of zinc give, with potassium ferrocyanide, whitish turbidities, from the 
intensity of which in 100 cc. an approximate estimate may be deduced. 

2. The zinc chloride, obtained from zinc sulphide (Scheme III. I IG |) 
by treatment with hydrochloric acid, is converted into zinc carbonate, 
the bulk of the acid being first neutralised with soda-lye, the liquid 
heated in a porcelain basin almost to ebullition, when an excess of 
soda-lye is gradually added. The zinc carbonate, filtered off according 
to the rules in 7, is placed in a porcelain crucible and ignited until 
the weight is constant ; the zinc oxide (ZnO) is weighed. Or according 
to Rose ( 481, 2). 

Barium. After separating out the heavy metals, according to 
Schemes I. and II. (iron and phosphates being chiefly concerned), by 
precipitation with sulphuric acid, barium sulphate is treated according 
to 176. Flour must always be examined according to 327. The 
examination of a portion of the original material in dilute hydrochloric 
acid for soluble compounds of barium must never be omitted ( 461). 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 371 



B. Decision on Inorganic Substances. 

482. The following section considers the toxicology of 
the elements above described only from the following points 
of view : 

1. Only the compounds of the greatest hygienic import- 
ance are discussed, i.e., chiefly those substances solely which 
may come into play in the household, and among these only 
the concentrations which actually occur in the household. 

2. "We treat merely of the introduction of substances by 
way of the digestive organs, by respiration, or of the un- 
injured skin and mucous membranes. All artificial ways 
of introduction (subcutaneous injection) are left out of 
consideration. 

3. Here and there only supplemental notes referring to 
industrial hygiene are introduced for the sake of com- 
pleteness. 

It is very striking how insufficient is our knowledge of 
many of the poisons to be here considered. Especially 
concerning copper, zinc, and tin we may read the most 
contradictory assertions. According to my own experience 
in case of copper ( 484), I am inclined to suppose that 
a series of cases have been falsely ascribed to poisonings 
by small quantities of metal. In general merely extremely 
small quantities even of the more soluble salts of the 
heavy metals are absorbed and pass into the organism. 
The maximum of the above-named metals, which we find 
in the entire body in acute arid even in chronic poisoning 
cases, does not exceed a few milligrammes, not considering 
the quantity present in the liver. 

It must, of course, be admitted as possible that there 
may occur in some persons an abnormally high sensitive- 
ness for certain metals or metallic salts, just as a similar 
phenomenon occurs for very many other poisonous sub- 
stances (e.g., Urticaria) after the consumption of cray-fish 
soup (Astacus fluviatilis) of strawberries, &c., and that a 
portion of the mysterious poisoning cases by metals which 



372 ARTICLES OF USE. 

we find in literature may thus be explained. It is further 
conceivable that possibly certain metallic compounds, as yet 
scarcely known, which might occur in food, are more readily 
absorbed than others. Especially large doses may occasion- 
ally exert a corrosive action upon the mucous membrane, 
and may thus occasion increased absorption. But at present, 
in the majority of cases, we cannot decide among these pos- 
sibilities. Very interesting facts which are here appropriate 
are found collected in Lewin's book, NebenwirTcungen der 
Arzneimittel, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1892. Many facts are explained, 
but the majority of observations are as yet unintelligible. 

In case of poisoning by foods, which contained mere traces 
of metals, we have, in addition to the phenomena discussed, 
to keep in view the possible action of a ptomaine. I must 
confess that the latter, where it is possible under the 
circumstances, seems to me worthy of the greatest atten- 
tion. I tun even convinced that a series of supposed 
poisonings by metals are in reality due to the action of 
decomposed foods. 

MERCURY. 

482 a. Mercury conies into action in the household at 
the utmost when opportunity is given for its evaporation 
by the breakage of a barometer, &c. (see 137). The greater 
are the sufferings of workmen who use metallic mercury 
the makers of mirrors, thermometers, &c. Minimum quanti- 
ties of mercury evidently suffice for chronic poisoning. Tin 
containing mercury has recently occasioned severe cases of 
poisoning when melted (II. Kayser). The soluble salts of 
mercury act like the metal. Mercurous nitrate occasions 
the disease of men employed in dressing hair-skins. 

Cinnabar, the red modification of mercury sulphide HgS, 
used as a pigment, is insoluble, and may be consequently 
considered as non-poisonous. 

LEAD. 

483. Metallic lead dissolves in distilled water in presence 
of carbon dioxide and air, and also in the most various kinds 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 373 

of drinking waters, unless solution is prevented by a large 
percentage of calcium bicarbonate. The latter, however, is 
not a perfect protection if the vessel is not entirely filled 
with water, and if air has access. 

All organic acids dissolve lead, not merely pure lead, but 
the alloys of lead and tin (tinned utensils, plumbiferous 
solder), the more the larger the proportion of lead and the 
more abundant the access of air. The corrosion is greatest 
when the metal is alternately wetted and exposed to the air, 
and when the temperature is high. On prolonged standing 
the lead in alloys is in part reprecipitated by the tin. The 
quantitative results of such experiments vary considerably in 
different authors according to the conditions of the experi- 
ment; if the proportion of lead is low (about 10 per cent, 
or less) mere traces of lead are dissolved by vinegar in the 
course of a few hours. 

Glazed and enamelled vessels may yield very considerable 
quantities of lead. Thus, e.g., Fleck obtained from a vessel 
holding about 1 litre, on boiling three times in succession 
( 460), 17-2, 151, and 12'3 mgrm. of lead. There are even 
on record cases (Schramm) where a culinary vessel of 
earthenware containing f litre yielded in twenty-four hours 
1-47 grm. lead. 

The cause of the extraction of lead is partly the use of 
bad materials, but still more imperfect burning. An ex- 
traction of lead has even been observed in cases of vessels 
of enamelled iron. Lead is very often present in the glaze 
or the enamel, but that need not concern us if nothing is 
dissolved out on the official trial, as it is then insoluble. 

The agitation commenced by W. Schultze against the use 
of plumbiferous glass for beer glasses is quite unjustifiable ; 
the minimum traces of lead alleged to pass into solution 
are quite irrelevant. (See Amthor, Ch. Zeil, 1890, No. 69.) 

Among the compounds of lead which are economically 
important, the salts of the common organic acids are readily 
soluble in water. Dilute acetic acid dissolves also reddish 
yellow litharge (lead oxide, PbO), red lead (minium, Pb 3 4 ), 
white lead (basic lead carbonate, PbC0 3 + PbO). 



374 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Hydrochloric acid converts all the above-mentioned com- 
pounds into sparingly soluble lead chloride. It also splits 
off lead chloride from chrome-yellow (PbO0 4 ) and chrome- 
red (PbCr0 4 + PbO), setting free the chromic acid. Lead 
chloride is sparingly soluble in water; but even lead sul- 
phate, though exceedingly difficult to dissolve, is soluble 
enough to give rise to chronic lead poisoning. 

Acute lead poisoning is very rare in domestic life, as for it 
large quantities of the salts of lead are necessary on account 
of their difficult absorption, when their bad taste acts as a 
warning. An acute poisoning may at most be occasioned 
by vinegar, wine, &c., which have been allowed to stand in 
leaden vessels. The symptoms are exactly those of copper 
and zinc poisoning. The literary statements concerning 
acute poisonings by small quantities of lead chromate appear 
improbable. Kern, in my laboratory, observed only transi- 
tory affections in dogs 011 the administration of 5 grm. in 
one dose, and in cats by 2 grm. He took personally 0*1 grm. 
at once without any result. 

The more important and more common is chronic lead 
poisoning, which may be occasioned by every preparation 
of lead, on the ingestion of extremely minute quantities, 
if only continued for a sufficient time. We may admit 
with Brouardel that even 1 mgrm. of lead acetate daily 
may suffice in some months for poisoning, whilst 0'2 to 04 
grm. taken in the course of a single day occasions at most 
vomiting, and was formerly often prescribed as a styptic 
and anti-diarrhceic. 

We can scarcely imagine a method in which chronic lead 
poisoning has not already been effected. 

The well-known symptoms are : a slate-grey border on 
the gums, lead colic, violent pains in the joints, lead paralysis 
(especially of the extensors of the wrist), and finally, injury 
to the brain, shrinkage of the kidneys, &c. 

According to the above, lead and compounds of lead, even 
in the smallest traces, are to be condemned in all substances 
destined for ingestion, and to be banished as completely as 
possible from the household, but certainly from the kitchen 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 375 

and the dining-room. The prescriptions of the Imperial law 
( 458) seem to me defective in one point only, there is no 
prohibition against the use of lead chromate in dyeing tissues. 
It is quite conceivable that danger may threaten not merely 
the maker of the clothes or yarns, but also the wearers. 

The symptoms of poisoning by lead chromate in man 
combine those of lead and of chrome. In the lower animals 
I obtained with it merely pure lead poisoning. Among 
thirty-four yellow tissues procured in Wlirzburg eight con- 
tained lead chromate in plenty ; a sample of cotton yarn 
contained in 100 grm. not less than 16 grm. lead and 8 grm. 
chrome ! Compare more detailed statements on record, 
K. B. Lehmann, Archiv f. Hygiene, xvi. 

In toys protected with a good linseed oil varnish it can 
scarcely occasion danger. Linseed oil varnish, prepared by 
boiling linseed oil with lead oxide, certainly contains lead, 
but in a very sparingly soluble form 1 and a very minute 
quantity; further a very small quantity is sufficient for a 
coating. 

Concerning the admissibility of lead water-pipes, in case 
of hard water poor in free carbonic acid, I have given my 
opinion in various passages (see Index). For a brief dis- 
cussion of all separate cases of the entire question see 
Dragendorff, p. 445. 

COPPER. 

484. Metallic copper, whether pure or alloyed with tin 
(bronze) or with zinc (brass, pinchbeck), is very sparingly 
soluble in water. 

In presence of air, however, copper dissolves well in dilute 
organic acids, in the fatty acids of rancid fats ; even moist 
carbonic acid forms basic copper carbonate (genuine verde- 
gris). Its ready solubility in all the mineral acids is known ; 
copper chloride may be formed by means of acetic acid and 
sodium chloride. Salts of copper are blue or green. 

1 Instead of litharge a preparation of manganese is now very generally used 
in the manufacture of linseed oil varnish. The danger of lead poisoning by 
its use is thus totally removed. Editor. 



376 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Among the salts the chloride, sulphate, nitrate, and the 
salts of organic acids dissolve readily in water; the basic 
acetates (the green and blue verdegris of commerce) form 
with excess of water a solution of copper acetate and a 
separation of more strongly basic acetates. 

Weak hydrochloric acid dissolves also copper hydroxide 
(Brerner blue), basic copper carbonate (mountain-blue and 
mountain -green), basic copper acetate, copper arsenite 
(As0 3 ) 2 Cu = Scheele's green, the double compound of copper 
arsenite and copper acetate (Schweinfurt green). See 
Arsenic. 

Copper oxide (CuO) is very sparingly soluble in the liquids 
of the body, and copper sulphide is insoluble. 

Acute Poisoning, Such a result cannot be produced by the 
metal, or by the sparingly soluble preparations (copper oxide, 
&C.) 1 Doses of the readily soluble compounds corre- 
sponding to from 10 to 30 mgrm. of copper suitably diluted 
and with correctives for the taste have, in general, no action. 
In doses of from 50 to 100 mgrm. Cu, and in a concentrated 
form, they certainly occasion sickness and vomiting. From 
0*2 to 0*3 grin, of copper sulphate are given several times in 
quick succession as an emetic. As much as 2J grm. copper 
sulphate in from five to six days is frequently given in croup. 
Otherwise it generally occasions no disturbance. There is 
no case on record in which a, healthy adult has been seriously 
injured by doses of 200 mgrm. Cu. 

After the ingestion of 132 mgrm. Cu in 200 grm. of peas, 
coloured even with copper acetate, there occurred no disturb- 
ance beyond a strong coppery taste lasting for some hours, 
and vomiting after three hours. A medical practitioner in 
my laboratory consumed in two meals the same weight of 
copper boiled up in meat. He experienced no symptoms at 
all. I have calculated that iu the very rarest case of a full 
meal in which all the ingredients contained a maximum 
proportion of copper, about 190 mgrm. might be ingested. 

1 Some desultory observations seek to refer chronic affections of the stomach 
to a copper coin which has remained in that organ. 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 377 

Larger quantities would at once betray themselves by the 
taste; 1200 mgrm. of Cu, corresponding to 5 grm. copper 
sulphate, is the smallest authenticated dose which has 
occasioned copper-poisoning in an adult. 

An especial toxicity of copper chloride, acetate, butyrate, 
oleate, or lactate could not be traced in experiments made 
in my laboratory on dogs, cats, rabbits, and on men. The 
soluble copper albuminates act, according to Feltz and Bitter, 
about like copper ammonium sulphate. 

Chronic Poisoning. Neither in man nor in the lower 
animals have injuries been observed in any series of experi- 
ments in consequence of small or medium doses from about 
50 to 100 mgrm. daily, after a little vomiting in the first 
days. Even doses of several decigrammes (from 3 to 5) 
of copper ammonium sulphate 1 taken for some months 
(Bourneville) occasioned no severe disturbances. There 
occurred at most some transitory intestinal affections. 
Toussaint (Vierteljahr. f. ger. Med., 1857) was not able 
to produce chronic poisoning in himself by very large 
doses of salts of copper. It must be remembered that 

1 The system rapidly becomes habituated to salts of copper. A dog experi- 
mented upon by Meyerhardt in my laboratory vomited after consuming 1 grm, 
copper chloride mixed with meat. But on the following days he ate without 
any symptoms O'l, then 0'2, 0'5, 1, 2, 2, 2 grm. Meyerhardt himself experi- 
enced some tendency to vomit the first time when he took, in solution, 10 
mgrm. copper in the form of copper sulphate. He continued these 10 mgrm. 
doses without intermission for fifty days, and he then took daily 20 mgrm. for 
thirty days, likewise without intermission. Kant in a similar manner took 
for fifty-one days copper acetate, beginning with 5 mgrm., and then increasing 
to 10, 15, 20, 25, and for the last eighteen days 30 mgrm. The last dose is 
almost equivalent to O'l grm. copper sulphate. He experienced no trace of 
indisposition. 

Hermbstadt (Orfila, vol. i., p. 316) relates as a proof of habituation to 
copper, that in his youth he ate eagerly "kummest," a favourite Thuringian 
dish, consisting of cabbage which had passed into the acetic fermentation, and 
was then boiled in a copper kettle. But when he again partook of this dish, 
after twelve years' absence from home, he was attacked with the most violent 
cholera and vomiting, whilst his family, who partook of the same dish but had 
not been absent from home, were not affected. This incident is capable of 
another interpretation. 100 grm. "sauerkraut" (a dish very similar to 
kummest) which in Hermbstadt's experiments occasioned colic, took up in 
the author's experiments, if preserved in copper vessels, in 24 hours only 2'88 
mgrm., and in 48 hours only 5 '9 mrgm. of copper. Quantities of 30 to 100 
myrm. Cu are always inert if mixed with food. 



378 ARTICLES OF USE. 

the preparations were taken in a concentrated form as 
pills. Galippe gave daily to dogs J grm. the most different 
salts of copper without injury. What has been said hitherto 
of nervous disturbances, paralysis, &c., occasioned by copper, 
is so unconnected that we have no occasion to admit any 
causal connection, and for the present we may refer the 
affection to the joint presence of lead, or to other accidental 
causes ( 482). 

From the above the danger of a systematic poisoning by 
copper is extremely smaller than is generally assumed, e.g., 
by Orfila. 

Of demonstrable severe acute poisoning cases by copper, 
produced by its admixture with food, not a single one has 
come to my knowledge. The reports in literature refer 
either to poisonings by ptomaines or to quite different 
poisons. See K. B. Lehmami's work mentioned in the 
bibliography. The danger of chronic poisoning by pre- 
served vegetables ( 349), bread ( 340), drinking-water 
( 201), or cheese ( 521) has, according to what has been 
said, probably never existed. The French Conseil d'Hygiene 
formally permits the addition of copper to peas, &c., if it is 
declared, and if it does not exceed 40 mgrm. per litre. 

The inhalation of copper-dust, bronze-dust, dust of copper 
acetate, as it occurs to workmen in certain manufactures, 
scarcely occasions serious disease. A reddening of the edge 
of the gums, and greenish spots on the teeth and the 
mucous membrane of the cheeks have been observed (Bailly, 
Chevallier, and Boys de Loury), but no other disturbances. 
At Fiirth, the chief seat of the manufacture of bronze- 
colours, nothing is known of copper-poisoning (Von Ker- 
chensteiner, Merkel). 

ARSENIC. 

48f>. Arseiiious acid [white arsenic (As. 2 3 )] and arsenic 
acid (As0 4 H 3 ), and their alkaline salts, are readily soluble in 
water. Copper arsenite (Scheele's green Cu 3 As 2 3 + 2H 2 0), 
mineral green, emerald green, and its double compound with 
copper acetate, Schweinfurt green, mitis green, Neuwied 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 379 

green, mountain green, May green, Vienna green, &c., are 
soluble in acids. Eealgar, AsS 2 , varying in colour from 
reddish-yellow to orange-yellow, and orpiment, As 2 S 3 , of a 
gold-yellow colour, are insoluble in water and dilute acid, but 
soluble in weak alkalies (ammonium carbonate, and therefore 
in the intestinal canal). Orpiment generally contains also 
a proportion of arsenious acid. Concerning the presence of 
arsenic in earthy colours see 491. Crude sulphuric acid 
often contains 1 grm. As 2 3 per kilo. In crude hydro- 
chloric acid there have been found even 6 grm. As 2 3 per 
kilo. (G. Buchner, Prauss). All the soluble arsenic com- 
pounds are easily absorbed, and easily again eliminated. 

Acute domestic poisonings with arsenic are tolerably rare, 
but they were formerly very common when Schweinfurt 
green and arsenical aniline colours were in use, e.g., on 
sewing or wearing a green ball-dress, on applying strongly 
arsenical wall-papers (fatal poisoning of an upholsterer, 
Journ. de Chim. Med., 1868), on the consumption of con- 
fectionery coloured with arsenical colours or arseniferous 
magenta, &c. 10 mgrm. As 2 3 have been observed to be 
dangerous to life, and 100 mgrm. are certainly fatal. The 
type of acute poisoning commences with a feeling of thirst 
and burning in the throat, and then becomes very similar to 
an attack of cholera. 

Chronic arsenical poisoning cases, especially from paper- 
hangings, have been, and still are, by no means rare occur- 
rences. The prolonged daily ingestion of very small 
quantities, from 1 to 3 mgrm., suffice evidently for severe 
poisoning. The symptoms of chronic arsenical poisoning 
are : catarrh of all the mucous membranes, especially of the 
conjunctiva of the eyes, ulceration of the nostrils, loss of 
hair, and cutaneous eruptions (eczema), increase of the liver 
and fatty degeneration, sometimes jaundice; after large 
doses of AsH 3 haemoglobinuria has often been observed, 
along with faintness, vomiting, diarrhoea, a sweetish taste 
in the mouth, &c. 

Arseniferous paper-hangings may exert a poisonous 
action in two manners : on the one hand, arseniferous dust 



380 ARTICLES OF USE. 

may become detached, especially if the colours are impeiv 
fectly fixed; secondly, in damp rooms hydrogen arsenide 
may be evolved under the influence of the acid generated 
on the decomposition of the paste and the size, and the 
simultaneously occurring processes of reduction (probably 
by moulds). This gas, even in the smallest quantities, is 
recognised by its garlic-like odour. A great number of 
serious poisoning cases have been recorded as occasioned by 
arsenical paper-hangings. Recently Rossbach (Tod durcJi 
arsenhaltige Tapeten oder Vergiftung mit Phosphor, Jena, 
1890, with bibliography of the subject) has with great 
probability referred the death of some children to residence 
in rooms containing arsenic hydride. 

Arseniferous hangings have had an injurious action even 
when pasted over with several layers of paper free from 
arsenic. In any case, arsenical paper-hangings are suspected 
more frequently than heretofore as having been the causes of 
illness (see, e.g., Kirchgassner, Vicrtclj. f. ger. Mcd., October 
1868). 

According to these observations compounds of arsenic 
should be absolutely banished from our houses; this con- 
demnation falls in the first place upon the brilliant green 
colours, Scheele's green and Schweinf urt green (lamp-shades, 
window-blinds, paper-hangings, gratings for flower-pots, 
artificial flowers), the aniline colour prepared with arsenic 
(especially formerly), or with the cheap refuse colours. 

There have been found, e.g., green stuffs containing I'Sarsenious acid 
in the square foot, playing-cards containing 5'4 cjrm. As 2 3 , paper- 
hangings with 1'7 <irm. per square metre. Very recently B. Fischer 
again found at Breslau a number of wax tapers coloured with Schwein- 
furt green. In 100 yrm. there were determined about 2, yrm. of the 
poisonous pigment. In 1878, of six of the finest green colours in 
Vienna only one was found free from arsenic ; the others contained 
quantities up to 2^ per cent, of arsenic. This is now no longer the case. 
Thus lately Oesterle, in sixteen samples of the aniline colours of com- 
merce, obtained no arsenical reaction on using J grm. of each in the. 
Marsh apparatus (C/tem. Zeit. Expert., 1890, p. 234). 

The German legal prescriptions, 458, suppress arsenic 
almost entirely, since they merely permit the use of arseni- 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 381 

ferous mordants in dyeing and printing tissues, with the 
condition that the finished goods must contain no arsenical 
compound soluble in water, and in general not more than 
2 mgrm. arsenic in 100 scm. of tissue. Unfortunately, in a 
succeeding paragraph a quantity of arsenic is permitted in 
dyes as an impurity, without any definite limit. Especially 
earthy ferruginous pigments often contain considerable 
quantities of arsenious acid; iron arsenite is certainly a 
sparingly soluble substance. 

Dragendorff 1 pronounces a material harmless as to its percentage of 
arsenic, if 100 scm. of paper-hangings, or 200 scm. of tissue, do not 
contain more than from 0'05 to 0'06 mgrm. arsenious acid, but rich in 
arsenic if from 0'7 to 0*8 are contained in the same volume. He is 
therefore decidedly stricter in his demands than the evidently mild 
German law. Schmelck alleges that he has observed in Sweden 
attacks of illness produced by bed-quilts containing 0'2 mgrm. arsenic 
in 100 scm. 

ANTIMONY. 

486. Metallic antimony (in type metal) is quite in- 
soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. 

Colourless tartar - emetic (antimonyl - potassium tartrate 
C 4 H 4 SbK0 7 + JH 2 0) is easily soluble in water. Of late 
other salts of antimony have been used in dyeing in its 
place, e.g., antimonyl potassium oxalate, antimony fluoride, 
antimony sulphate, &c. These antimony salts form in- 
soluble compounds with the colouring substances which they 
fix, and if the work is correctly performed, the superfluous 
soluble salt is washed out again. The orange -coloured 
golden sulphide Sb 2 S is insoluble in water, weak hydrochloric 
acid, and ammonium carbonate ; it is sometimes added to 
caoutchouc articles on vulcanising. Antimonial cinnabar 
(Sb 2 OS 2 ) is now scarcely in use ; it is soluble in hydrochloric 
acid. 

Antimonial compounds can scarcely come into action in

the household by way of the digestive organs. Tartar 
emetic has proved fatal in doses of 0*5 grm.\ as an emetic 
it is given in repeated doses of 0*03 to 0*1 grm. Cases are 
known in which even 10 mgrni. produced violent emesis. 
Chronic poisonings have been produced experimentally by 
small doses ; if from 1 to 10 mgrm. are taken daily for 
about a fortnight severe chronic illness is occasioned. 

Of much greater hygienic importance is the action of 
tartar emetic by way of the skin, when it occasions eczema 
and inflammations of the skin. Such cases have been 
repeatedly known, occasioned by tissues from which the 
antimonial mordants have not been properly washed out. 

Biselioff found in lOOyrra. of yarn 14 mr/rm. of antimony soluble in 
water, and from 36 to 310 mgrm. soluble in hydrochloric acid (Re- 
per tor ium fur Anal. Chemie, 1883, No. 20). Kayser found in 100 scm. 
of a red-brown lining cloth, which had occasioned eczema, 85 mgrm. of 
antimony soluble in water. It is generally assumed that only such 
compounds are harmful as are soluble in water. Forth lias proved the 
harmlessness of antimony tannate by experiments on his own person 
(wearing stockings specially prepared). 

The injuries to the skin thus occasioned may serve as 
entrances for pathogenic micro-organisms, and thus occasion 
" blood-poisoning." The Bavarian agreements propose the 
same demands for antimony in tissues as for arsenic. 



TIN. 

487. Metallic tin is almost insoluble in distilled water 

O 

and in spring water ; also in solutions of common salt. In 
acetic acid and other organic acids it is slightly soluble, but 
readily soluble in hydrochloric acid. 

From alloys of lead and tin both metals pass into solution 
in acetic acid at first ; after some hours the tin precipitates 
most of the lead, whilst the proportion of tin slowly in- 
creases. The precipitated lead, as well as that in solution, is 
liable to occasion illness if mixed with food. 

The soluble salts of tin used in dyeing, pink-salts (SnCl 2 + 
NH 4 C1), sodium stannate (Sn0 3 Na 2 ), and sodium stannite 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 383 

(SnO + NaOH), 1 can scarcely occasion injury in domestic 
life. 

Metastannic acid (Sn0 3 H 2 ), stannic oxide (Sn0 2 ), tin sul- 
phide = mosaic gold (SnS 2 ), are quite insoluble in water and 
dilute acids. The tin in preserved vegetables is also found 
insoluble in acids. 

Acute poisoning cases have not been hitherto traced with 
absolute certainty to compounds of tin met with in the 
household. 

Notwithstanding the intense toxicity of the soluble compounds of tin, 
if injected subcutaneously, morbid phenomena can be occasioned by 
way of the stomach only by doses so large as do not readily occur in 
domestic life. The absorption is very slight. After taking O'o grm. 
of tin in the form of preserved food, Ungar and Bodlander found 
only 4 mgrm. of tin in the urine, and no morbid symptoms whatever ; 
but they allege having an acute case of poisoning in man with tin by 
preserved asparagus. Similar cases have been reported from England. 
Preserved cherries contained 0'67 per cent, tin malate (abstract in 
Viertelj. in d. Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Nahrungsmittel, 1890, 
p. 227). And from Holland, where 270 soldiers had eaten meat and 
salad from tin cans (Chem. Zeitung, xv., 1891, p. 564). Several similar 
cases have recently become known. 

It has already been intimated (see 484, Copper) that such cases of 
acute poisoning with tin excite in me the suspicion of poisoning with 
a ptomaine. 

Chronic poisonings are scarcely to be apprehended. Ungar and 
Bodlander have produced in dogs, along with disturbances of digestion, 
grave affections of the spinal cord in the course of more than a year. They 
gave a dog weighing 7J kilos, at first O'Ol to 0'12, and finally 0*4, 0'6, and 
0*8 grm. of tin in the state of soluble sodium stannite. In another 
case, 0'02 to 0'2 and 0'6 of stannous chloride were admitted for the 
same length of time. A chronic affection in man by the abundant use 
of tinned foods is conceivable only if what is certainly possible, but 
quite unproven the susceptibility of man to tin is much greater than 
that of the dog. 

ZINC. 

488. Metallic zinc, like lead, is somewhat soluble in 
water with the co-operation of free carbonic acid, but readily 
soluble in organic and inorganic acids. Dilute acids dissolve 
zinc-white (zinc-oxide, ZnO), zinc-yellow (zinc-chromate, 

1 Tin-crystals (stannous chloride SnCl 2 + 2H 2 0) are used on a large scale in 
dyeing. Sodium stannite is rarely used in England. Editor. 



384 ARTICLES OF USE. 

ZnCr0 4 ), and lithopone [a white powder formed by mixing 
zinc sulphate and barium sulphide = ZnS + ZnO + BaS0 4 , 
used for colouring walls]. 

Acute Poisoning. As far as observations are available, 
what has been said concerning copper holds good here 
qualitatively and quantitatively. Zinc sulphate is used as 
an emetic, and large doses (several grammes) have at times 
occasioned severe illness and even death. Zinc oxide is said 
to be bearable by grammes without injury, but if accidentally 
mixed with confectionery it has occasioned vomiting and 
diarrhoea (Zeit. des allg. osterr. Apothekervereins, vol. xvi. 1878, 
p. 407). 

Inflammation of the skin has been occasioned by wearing 
paper collars containing zinc oxide. Persons have been 
known in whom mild zinc ointment produces inflammation 
of the skin. 

Chronic poisoning by the ingestion of small doses (up to 
10 mgrm.} does not seem to occur. Aarlandt and Mylius 
report that in the districts where zinc blende is mined zinci- 
ferous waters are in many cases universally drunk without 
injury, so, e.g., at Tuttendorf, water containing 7 mgrm. zinc 
per litre has been in use for more than a century (Corre- 
2K>ndcnzUatt des Vcr. Anal. Ckem., 1879, Xos. 2 and 3). In 
the north of France milk is always preserved in zinc pails, 
and never occasions poisoning. In human organs, especially 
in the liver, there are often found considerable quantities of 
zinc, though no symptoms of zinc poisoning have occurred, 
and no medical treatment has been required. These facts 
are connected with the wide distribution of zinc in articles 
of food. 

If larger doses (decigrammes or upwards) are introduced 
into the stomach for some time (in medicines), chronic dis- 
turbances of digestion may occur with their consequences 
(cachexia), but authorities are agreed that severe danger to 
health can scarcely arise ; speedy recovery generally ensues 
after the digestion has been improved by the elimination of 
the zinc. 

Some observers speak also of nervous disturbances which 



DECISION ON INORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 385 

occur in zinc workers after about ten years, e.g. y resembling 
Tabes dorsalis (Schlokow). Unquestionable observations on 
chronic nervous affections, similar to lead poisoning, have 
not been made known. They are at least much rarer than 
from lead. Tracinski considers the ascription of the diseases 
of zinc smelters to zinc as not sufficiently demonstrated, and 
calls attention to lead, cadmium, arsenic, carbon monoxide, 
sulphur, and carbon dioxides, which come simultaneously 
into play (Viertelj. fur off. Gesundheitspflege, 1888, p. 59). 

Concerning the " casting-fever " of zinc and brass workers 
from inhaling the fumes of zinc (?) or zinc oxide, see Hirt 
(Krankheiten der Arleiter, i. 85, ii. 165, iii. 82). 

According to Tracinski the "casting-fever" is entirely 
absent at the zinc works. 

NICKEL. 

489. Only metallic nickel and the salts formed from it by the acids 
used in the household possess hygienic interest. 

According to Rhode, 500 cc. of 2 or 4 per cent, lactic, acetic, nitric, or 
tartaric acid, on standing for twenty-four hours in a basin of pure 
nickel or nickelised brass, &c., take up about from 25 to 35 mgrm. of 
nickel. In three hours, at the temperature of ebullition, there are 
taken up from 12 to 30 mgrm. ; a 4 per cent, acid does not dissolve an 
importantly greater quantity than one at 2 per cent. Butyric acid 
attacks nickel more slightly. According to Laborde and Riche solu- 
tions of alkaline carbonates also take up a little nickel. 

Domestic poisonings with nickel have not been hitherto observed. 
Rhode has used nothing but nickel vessels in his house for five years. 
Evidently even the more soluble salts of nickel are not readily absorbed, 
or they are promptly eliminated by way of the liver and the bowel. 
About ^ grm. of nickel sulphate, given daily to powerful dogs, occa- 
sioned neither acute nor chronic affections. See Jung, H. Schulz, and 
Geerkens, Laborde and Riche. Very large doses act about similarly to 
the salts of copper. The hygienic decision must for the present agree 
with that given on copper. 

CHROME. 

490. Chrome yellow (PbCrOJ and chrome red (PbCr0 4 + 
PbO) and barytes yellow (BaCr0 4 ) are insoluble in water, 
but soluble in dilute acids. The case is the same with zinc 
yellow (ZnCr0 4 ), which usually contains potassium chromate, 
and gives it up in water. Chrome green (Cr 2 3 + 2H 2 0) = 

VOL. II. 2 B 



386 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Guignet's green, or permanent green, is quite insoluble. It 
is a dark green colour, which is rendered lighter and of a 
bluish-grey by an admixture of barium sulphate. Or it is 
changed to a bright green by the addition of any of the chrome 
yellows enumerated above (Victoria green, permanent green, 
oil green, Niirnberg green, zinc green). 

Guignet's green is harmless ; the compounds of chromium 
oxide are altogether very slightly poisonous. The chromates 
may occasion lead, zinc, or barium poisoning, in addition to 
the effects of chromic acid. Hitherto only chromate of lead 
has been closely studied ( 483). Concerning the other 
substances we can only say that zinc and barium chromates 
must be poisonous. Potassium chromate and chromic acid 
are very poisonous. 

ALUMINA. 1 

490tf. Alum, aluminium chloride, and sulphate are easily 
soluble in water. They are used in dyeing, but in the course 
of the processes they are almost invariably changed into 
insoluble compounds (alumina, coloured lakes), which have 
no toxicological importance. Concerning alum in bread, see 
o40. Wibmer took by degrees in 1-i- days 3*65 yrm. alum 
dissolved in 350 grm. water. The result was some consti- 
pation (Hepertorium der Pharmacie ron Buchner, 1831, vol. 39). 

The various blue, green, &c., ultramarines are compounds 
of alumina, potassa, silica, and sulphur of unknown consti- 
tution, and varying composition. They evolve sulphuretted 
hydrogen in contact with acids, but in the doses in which 
they may be introduced into the human system in domestic 
life they do not involve appreciable hurtfulness. 

COBALT, IRON, URANIUM, CADMIUM, SILVER, GOLD. 

491. Household poisonings by these metals are scarcely 
known, though some of them are very poisonous if they are

showing that they are not open to any hygienic objection. Plagge and

artificially introduced into the body in suitable compounds. 
Here we must refer to the text-books of toxicology. But 
danger is scarcely possible in the following forms, almost the 
only states in which they occur in domestic life. 

Cobalt : Cobalt silicate = Si0 3 Co = smalts. Cobaltous oxide, stan- 
nous oxide = CoO + SnO = coeruleum. Cobalt oxide, aluminium oxide 
=A1 2 3 . Co 2 3 = Thenard's blue = cobalt ultramarine. Cobalt oxide, 
zinc oxide = Co 2 3 + ZnO = Kinmann's green = green vermilion. 

Cobalt scarcely meets with practical applications in any other state. 

Iron in its ordinary forms may be regarded as harmless. They are : 
Metallic iron and steel, oxide of iron = Fe 2 3 = English red = caput 
mortuum, mixtures of iron oxide, iron hydroxide, and iron carbonate as 
rust ; the ferric salt of hydroferricyanic acid = (FeCy6) 3 Fe 4 = Paris 
blue, Berlin blue, Prussian blue. The ferrous salt of hydroferrocyanic 
acid = Fe 2 Cyi 2 Fe 3 = Turnbull's blue. 

As little injurious are the compounds of iron formed in the prepara- 
tion of food, iron salts of the acids of fruits, of milk, of tannin, &c. 

The yellow, brown, and red earth colours (ochres, terra di Sienna, &c.), 
which consist of ferric oxide and carbonate, are per so quite harmless, 
but they sometimes contain quantities of arsenic which are not unim- 
portant. Iron arseniate is insoluble. Iron arsenite is soluble only if 
heated with concentrated acids. 

Silver and Gold. When pure, or in their usual alloys with copper, 
they are unimportant, as they are never dissolved in quantities to prove 
injurious. 

Cadmium. Is used only as cadmium sulphide, CdS, a pigment 
insoluble in water, dilute acids, and alkalies. According to Marme it 
is harmless if given to animals in large doses. Soluble salts of cadmium 
are very poisonous. 

Uranium. Used at present only for the production of yellow colours 
in glass, porcelain, and enamels. Its intense toxicity, discovered by 
Robert, will not readily have opportunities for development. 



BARIUM. 

492. Barium chloride is easily soluble in water; the 
carbonate dissolves in dilute acids, and the chromate (barium 
yellow) in hydrochloric acid, but not in acetic acid. Barium 
sulphate (heavy spar, blanc fixe, permanent white) is quite 
insoluble. It plays an important part in the manufacture of 
paper-hangings and coloured papers, as a harmless, unchange- 
able body colour. 

On acute barium poisoning, see 340. Chronic poison- 
ings have not been hitherto observed.

II. ORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 

A. Examination for Organic Substances. 

493. As far as colourless organic substances are of 
especial hygienic importance, they have been considered in 
previous chapters ; other important substances of this kind 
do not occur among articles of common use. 1 On the other 
hand, the organic colouring-matters concern hygiene to a 
somewhat high degree. 

Among the many vegetable colouring-matters and the few 
animal substances in practical use, gamboge (the inspissated 
milky juice of Hebradodendron cochinensis) employed as a 
yellow pigment, is the only one known as a poison. The 
Swiss chemists prohibit also berberine (Chemiker Zeitung, 
1891, No. 80). 

On the other hand, among the hundreds of coal-tar colours 
which have come into use, some possess great importance, 
either by the frequency of their employment, their great 
toxicity, or their demonstrated harmlessness. 

The presence of an organic colouring-matter is rendered 
probable in general by the circumstance that the reactions 
for inorganic coloured compounds fail, if, e.g., the ash shows 
no constituent which may have occasioned the colour, such 
as chrome, lead, copper, &c. But frequently, in spite of the 
presence of such elements, we may often have before us 
organic colours fixed by means of metallic mordants. Or- 
ganic colouring-matters, in contrast to those of inorganic 
nature, are often soluble not only in water, but also in 



1 It is, perhaps, necessary to mention oxalic acid, which occasionally proves 
poisonous by being confounded with other white powders, and is often very 
carelessly, used as a cleansing agent. It is recognised by the white precipitate 
which it gives with solutions of calcium chloride of a neutral or an alkaline 
reaction (calcium oxalate), and by its property of very quickly decolorising 
solutions of permanganate in presence of sulphuric acid ( 197). Of course 
all the methods for the removal of organic matter destroy also oxalic acid 
( 461). If there occurs an oxalate insoluble in water, it must be dissolved 
in dilute hydrochloric acid, adding afterwards calcium chloride and ammonia. 
For the detection of phenol see Dragendorff (Bibliography). 



EXAMINATION FOE ORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 389 

alcohol, ether, petroleum-ether, chloroform. Others dissolve 
in water or alcohol on the addition of a little acid or alkali, 
and show, on the addition of acid or alkali, very striking 
changes of colour, such as scarcely occur in inorganic com- 
pounds. It is recommended to prepare extracts with the 
above-mentioned solvents, and to place them (after concentra- 
tion if requisite) in white porcelain capsules or large watch- 
glasses set on a white support, adding different reagents, the 
most important of which are : concentrated hydrochloric acid, 
concentrated sulphuric acid (with a subsequent addition of 
water), soda-lye. It may also be important to show whether 
the colouring-matter discharged by stannous chloride in 
an aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid is de- 
colorised (reduced), which is the case with almost all the 
azo-dyes now so largely in use. 

The production of reactions by laying dyed swatches in 
the reagents leads often to more uncertain results, as the 
colours are often mixtures, and the reactions appear dis- 
tinctly only with the pure colours. If we have to examine 
powder-colours, we may obtain an insight into the purity or 
the unitary character of the colouring-matter by scattering 
a very little of the powder upon wet filter-paper, and then 
upon concentrated sulphuric acid, observing the character of 
the halos which form around each particle of the powder. 
Tinctorial chemists separate solutions of mixed colouring- 
matters by fractionated introduction of wool or silk, and 
comparing the shades obtained each time. See also

woods. 1882. 2nd edit. 

It had been my intention to give criteria for the recog- 
nition of the most important, and especially of the poisonous 
dyewares. But I have abandoned this intention, as, after 
a close investigation, I must dissuade the physician from 
making experiments in order to detect a given colouring- 
matter, especially when it occurs not as a pure powder- 
colour, but only as a dyed specimen. The number of the 
artificial organic colours now in use exceeds 300, and those of

them which are poisonous are generally not characterised by 
such reactions that their mention here would be useful with- 
out enumerating the numerous substances which are either 
decidedly harmless, or whose physiological action is unknown. 
These substances, on account of the similarity of their re- 
actions, must come in question in the differential diagnosis. 
Even thorough chemists if not quite specially engaged with 
tinctorial chemistry though in possession of the best and 
most recent works on the subject, and of numerous compara- 
tive colours, regard the determination of an unknown colour 
submitted to them as generally a very difficult problem, and 
often as one not to be solved with certainty. An uncertain 
determination is generally useless for a decision. 

I must, therefore, content myself with referring to the 
bibliography of the subject, endeavouring to treat the alleged 
results with great scepticism. When an organic colouring- 
matter is said to have exerted a poisonous action, we must 
never forget to test the suspected substance for arsenic and 
antimony, as well as for other inorganic poisons. (See 
Decision.} Experiments on animals should be made upon 
dogs, or especially upon cats, rather than upon rabbits. (See 
95.) 



B. Decision on Organic Substances, 1 especi- 
ally Coal-Tar Colours. 

494. The hygienic signification of the tar-colours has 
been hitherto very variously estimated. When the intensely 
toxic action of the first, crude, often intensely arsenical, 



1 Along with the coal-tar colours we may here mention gamboge and oxalic 
acid. 

Gamboge in doses of O'l to 0'2 grm. is a drastic purgative which occasion- 
ally produces other unpleasant effects (violent vomiting, irritation of the 
kidneys), and in larger doses it may prove fatal. Sonnenschein reports a case 
of death in a man from 0'37 <jrm. 

Oxalic acid has proved fatal in 5 grm. doses, quantities of 45 grm. have 
been endured. The action is partly that of ordinary acid-poisoning (corrosion, 
hujrnatemesis, and collapse) ; partly in subsequent stages, cerebral, with 
convulsions and paralysis. Anuria and glykosmria are frequent. 



DECISION ON ORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 391 

colours had been observed, we were disposed to judge the 
tar-colours very severely ; when it was afterwards found out 
that the impurities had been the chief cause of the injuries 
to health, there followed a period in which no coal-tar colour 
was recognised as poisonous in a pure state (Eulenberg and 
Vohl, 1870). Subsequent research, however, has made 
known a series of tar-colours which possess, in fact, con- 
siderable toxicity. There are already some cases known 
not very many in which severe and even deadly poison- 
ings have been occasioned by pure colouring-matters. At 
the same time there still exist the possibilities described 
by Eulenburg and Yohl ( Vierteljahrsschrift fur gericlitliclie 
Mediz., 1870), whereby harmless colours may become in- 
jurious ; but the realisation of these possibilities has become 
decidedly rarer with the changes and improvements in 
technical chemistry. 

1. Colours may be contaminated by means of poisonous 
raw materials (aniline, phenol, &c.). 

2. Oxidising agents which ought to have been washed out 
have been left behind from negligence, e.g., arsenic acid, 
mercuric and mercurous nitrates, mercuric chloride, tin and 
zinc chlorides, antimony oxide and chloride, lead peroxide. 

There was especial danger in the use of the richly arseni- 
ferous residual colours, waste colours. 1 

3. Harmless colour bases are combined, not with harmless 
acids, like the acetic, but the poisonous arsenious or picric acid : 

e.g., Aniline-green picrate = iodine-green. 

Kosaniline picrate = mauvaniline (orange). 2 

4. The cloth is previously treated with poisonous mordants 
which form with the bases upon the fibre sparingly soluble 
lake colours, e.g., tartar emetic, arsenic acid, &c. From 
negligence the excess of soluble mordant is left in the fibre. 

Toxic actions of tar-colours may occur, especially in two 
ways: 

1 The waste from the Medlock process for making magenta is largely used 
for killing vermin, under the name of " London purple." Editor. 

2 Neither of these colours can be called a picrate. Picric acid is often added 
to aniline greens in the dye-bath, if a more yellow tone is desired. Editor. 



392 ARTICLES OF USE. 

1. By the consumption of coloured foods. 

2. By the wearing of dyed clothing. 

495. The question whether dyed tissues, free from 
poisonous antimonial or arsenical mordants, may produce 
affections of the skin seems decided, at least, for picric acid. 
E. v. Hosslin (Munch, med. Wochenschrift, 1888, p. 637) 
describes an intense inflammation of the skin of the feet, 
with the formation of small vesicles and a strong yellow 
coloration in a man who wore shoes dyed with picric acid, 
along with stockings which were too thin. The colouring of 
the shoes was so intense that colouring-matter could be 
distinctly wiped off with a wet finger. 

The question is less definite for the orange or red colours 
which are often accused. Corallin (substances containing 
rosolic acid), though accused by Tardieu and Eoussin, has 
been proved by Landin, Babault, Bourguignon, and Weikert 
(1869) to be perfectly harmless when pure. Hence the 
former complaints must be referred to an impure material 
(arsenical mordant ?). Sell has met with corallin which 
contained from its preparation an admixture of free 
phenol, by which the formation of vesicles might easily be 
explained. Aniline orange (Victoria yellow) has been 
especially often accused as the cause of skin affections. 
Crookes has admitted that the pure colouring-matter is the 
injurious principle, which is very possible, in view of its 
intimate connection with picric acid. Experiments also 
prove that striped stockings occasioned vesicles only where 
the coloured pails came in contact with the skin. To 
explain the striking fact that all men are not equally sensi- 
tive to aniline orange, Crookes refers to the unequally basic 
reaction of the sweat ; alkalies are able to dissolve aniline 
orange, but water is not 1 (Fharm. Journal, 1868, October). 

Whether or no Crookes has found the right explana- 
tion, it is plain that the skin of different men reacts very 



1 Compare notice, 495A, on safranine and cosine. Weyl observed a case 
where new indigo-blue stockings, which had not been perfectly freed from 
sulphuric acid by washing, occasioned irritation of the skin (Berlin med. 
(Resell. Sitzuny, 22,1889).

differently with chemical agents. See Von Sehlen, Central- 
Matt fur Bakt., vol. viii., p. 92. 

49 5 A. I give now a list of those coal-tar colours on the 
harmlessness or toxicity of which we have definite informa- 
tion. Unfortunately the majority of the observations have 
only been made on dogs and rabbits, and the meritorious 
work of Weyl, from which I chiefly derive the following 
observations, has only appeared in part. 

I call the substances injurious which, if given daily to a 
strong dog in doses of several centigrammes, occasion a dis- 
turbance of health either immediately or after a few repeti- 
tions. On the contrary, the colours which, when given for 
weeks in doses of 1 grm. or several grammes, are tolerated 
without disturbance, or only with unimportant symptoms in 
the intestinal canal, or with slight transient albuminuria, are 
pronounced harmless. We must not forget that even a few 
milligrammes of the coal-tar dyes colour very intensely, and 
that hardly more than a few milligrammes, or at most centi- 
grammes, can find their way into the human stomach, even 
when very carelessly used, e.g., by children. In extremely 
large doses, of course, many substances e.g., all our spices 
are injurious. 

Austria has, by the law of May 1, 1886, excluded all the 
coal-tar dyes (and rosolic acid) from use in colouring food 
and articles of consumption. 

YELLOW COLOURING-MATTERS. 

A. HARMLESS OR SLIGHTLY POISONOUS. 

Naphthol yellow S. (acid yellow S., fast yellow, aniline yellow, 
succinine, sulphur yellow, citronine, jaune nouveau, jaune solide). 
From 2 to 4 grm. occasion in man colic and diarrhoea. Dogs scarcely 
affected by large doses. Said to be used in Algeria for colouring 
vermicelli. 

Fast yellow R. (acid yellow R., yellow W.), Cazeneuve. 

Brilliant yellow. Very large doses harmless to the dog. 

Orange I. (a-Naphthol orange, Tropaeoline OOONI). 

Bismarck brown. Slightly poisonous. 0-35 grm. per kilogramme 
cause albuminuria and vomiting in dogs ; increased doses occasion no 
more injury. Small doses, 0-045 per kilogramme, quite harmless. 



394 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Soudan I. In very large doses (5 grm. daily) it produced slight 
albuminuria in a large dog. 

Ponceau 4 G. B. (croceine orange, brilliant orange). Large doses 
not toxic to the dog. 

Chrysoidine. Dog weighing 9'5 kilos, received 1 grm.. daily for a 
month. Merely slight loss of weight and presence of albumen in the 
urine. Larger doses (10 grm. at once) occasion more severe albumin- 
uria. Blascliko observed in some workmen severe dermatitis, alleged 
to be occasioned by this dye, but not in others. 

Azarine. Dog weighing 10 kilos, took 20 grm. in twenty days. 
Only slight albuminuria. 

Fast brown. Dog of 5-6 kilos, consumed daily for a month 2 grm. 
colouring-matter. Attacked with slight but persistent diarrhoea. 

Chrysamine R. Large doses occasion slight albuminuria in the dog. 

Butter yellow (dimethylamidoazo benzol). Harmless to rabbits, 
according to Weyl. 

B. POISONOUS. 

Picric acid. Toxicity considerable, especially for persons in feeble 
health, though it has been exaggerated. From 0*6 to 0'9 potassium 
picrate has often been tolerated by man for a long time ; was at one 
time used as a medicine. Very small doses occasion a yellow colora- 
tion of the skin and conjunctiva. 

Saffron substitute (gold yellow, Victoria yellow, Victoria orange, 
aniline orange = potassium or ammonium salt of a dinitrocresol). Very 
poisonous. O'OoO per kilogramme, administered by way of the stomach, 
killed dogs with violent emesis, dyspncea, and repeated cramps. A 
fatal case has occurred in a human subject by 4| grm. administered 
instead of saffron to effect abortion. 

Martius yellow (naphthol yellow, Manchester yellow, saffron 
yellow, jaune d'or, dinitronaphthol.) Strong poison. 0'14 grin, per 
kilogramme for two days killed a dog with emesis, violent thirst, rise 
of temperature, and albuminuria. 

Aurantia (Imperial yellow). A Basle specimen was found poisonous 
by Gnehm. Others found Berlin specimens harmless. Weyl could not 
1 est their substance from want of material. 

Orange II. (gold orange, /3-naphthol orange, tropa?oline 000 No. 2, 
mandarine, mandarine G extra, chrysaurine). 14 grm. given in three 
doses kill a dog of 10| kilos, in nineteen days. Diarrhoea, loss of 
appetite, albuminous urine, ulceration of the bowel, fatty degeneration 
of liver and kidneys. 

Metanil yellow (orange M. X.). 21 grm. of this dye killed a dog 
of 11| kilos, in twelve days. Vomiting, albuminuria, death without 
characteristic symptoms. 

Safranine. Administered by way of the stomach. 2 grm. daily 
harmless ; on the prolonged use of large doses it produces diarrhoea 
and cachexy ; 0'05 yrm. per kilogramme killed a dog if injected sub- 



DECISION ON ORGANIC SUBSTANCES. 395 

cutaneously (Weyl, Zeit. /. Hygiene, 1889, viii. 35). Weyl observed 
affections of the skin from a vest lining dyed with safranine. 1 

BEDS. 

Rouge soluble (azorubine S, fast red C, crimson). Harmless. 

Rouge pourpre (new coccine, brilliant ponceau, cochineal red D, 
fast red D, Bordeaux S, amaranth, azoacid rubine 2 B). Harmless. 

Bordeaux B. Fast red B. Harmless. 

Ponceau R. (ponceau 2 R, xylidine red, xylidine ponceau). Harmless. 

Metanitro azotine. 1 to 2 grm. daily harmless to a large dog. 

Orchil substitute (naphthion. red). 24 grm. were given in a month 
to a dog weighing 4*5 kilos, without injury. 

Congo red. Very large doses occasioned merely slight albuminuria. 

Magenta (aniline red, rubine, roseine, f uchsine). Impure magentas 
occur in trade also as maroon, garnet, geranium, cerise ; is perfectly 
harmless. Men tolerate 0'5 grm.. daily for a long time ; 50 mgrm. daily 
were given for five weeks without effect. 20 grm. have been given to 
dogs at once without injury. 

Acid magenta (rubine S, acid rubine), the sodium salt of the sul- 
phonic acid of magenta, is to be regarded similarly. 

Coralline, Peonine, Rosolic Acid, see 495. Pure coralline was 
found harmless by Weikert if ingested along with food. 

Eosine, Erythrosine (and a series of closely allied derivatives of 
fluoresceine containing bromine and iodine are, according to Grand- 
homme, quite harmless to rabbits and to the men employed at the 
colour-works). Weyl observed a case in which an affection of the skin 
was occasioned by wearing a ribbon dyed with eosine by the eosine ? 

GREEN. 

Dinitrosoresorcine (dyes cotton green if mordanted with salts of 
iron : Resorcine green, Alsace green, solid green). Large doses occasion 
at most slight albuminuria in the dog. 

Naphthol green. The same. 

Acid green (Helvetia green), harmless according to Cazeneuve, is 
no longer in use. 

Malachite green. Harmless (Grandhornme). 

BLUE, VIOLET, AND BLACK. 

Wool black. Very large doses merely occasion slight albuminuria. 

Naphthol black. The same. 

Azo blue. The same. 

Water blue (China blue, marine blue), non-poisonous according to 
Cazeneuve ; also pronounced harmless by Santrini, like water blue, 
black blue, and Nicholson blue (alkali blue). 

1 Safranine must have been placed by accident among the yellows. It is a 
beautiful and peculiar rose dye. Editor. 



396 ARTICLES OF USE. 

Victoria blue. Injurious according to Santrini ; 10| grm. fatal in 
twenty-two days to a dog weighing 5^ kilos. 

New blue. Injurious according to Santrini ; 12'5 grm. in thirty 
days fatal to a dog weighing 4^ kilos. Persistent vomiting, salivation, 
extreme emaciation. 

Gallocyanine. Included among the poisonous colours by Santrini. 
A dog weighing 5 '4 kilos, remained healthy after the ingestion of 7 -5 
yrm. in thirty days. On dissection incipient fatty degeneration in liver 
and kidneys. 

Indigo extract. Harmless according to Santrini. 

Induline (an extensive group of nearly allied colours, including 
Coupler's blue, fast blue B and R, acetiiie blue, nigrosine), are harmless 
according to Cazeneuve, but very poisonous according to Santrini. 

Gentiana violet. 4-7 grm. taken by way of the mouth by a dog 
weighing 3 kilos, proved fatal in seven days ; loss of appetite and 
diarrhoea. On dissection there was found incipient interstitial hepatitis 
and hypersemia of kidneys (Santrini). 

Methyl violet and its allies (dahlia, aniline blue [gentiana blue 6 B]), 
seem quite harmless (Grandhomme, Stilling, Santrini), as also acid 
violet, according to Cazeneuve and Santrini. 

Alizarine blue. Perfectly insoluble in water ; according to Ehrlich 
practically harmless introduced by way of the stomach. Alizarine 
blue S (the sodium salt of the sulphonic acid of alizarine) is poisonous. 
0'4 grm. per kilogramme is a fatal dose for cats, and about 1 grm. per 
kilo, for rabbits. 

Coeruleine. Insoluble, harmless (Ehrlich). 

Cceruleine S. Poisonous subcutaneously (Ehrlich). 

Indophenol. Insoluble in water, occasions diarrhoea if ingested into 
the bowel in large quanities (Ehrlich). A dog weighing 3 kilos, received 
in thirty days 18 grm. per os. Remained in health. On dissection 
slight fatty degeneration of liver (Santrini). 

Methylen blue. Rather poisonous ; according to Kowalewsky 
(Centralblatt f. die med. Win&en, 1878, p. 209) cats easily tolerate the 
intervenous injection of 0'04 grm. in solution of sodium chloride. 
Ehrich and Lipmann gave inwardly for therapeutic purposes from O'l 
to TO grm. of methylen blue without any injury (Deut. Med. Wochen- 
schrift, 1890, No. 23). 

Ethylen blue behaves in a similar manner.

SECTION XIX. 

POINTS OF VIEW FOR INVESTIGATING THE 
CAUSES OF AN EPIDEMIC. 

496. However satisfactory has been the increase of our 
knowledge concerning the exciters of a considerable number 
of infectious diseases during late years, our accurate acquaint- 
ance with the true causes of the occurrence of epidemics 
increases but slowly. Altogether, I may venture to say, 
scarcely one extensive epidemic has been hitherto fully and 
completely explained, so as to give no room for objections ; 
no doubt some unexplained phenomenon has always remained. 
If statistics have rendered it probable that, e.g., water or milk 
had conveyed the exciter of the infection, the direct recogni- 
tion of the latter has generally been lacking. If the water, 
according to all the rules of logic, has been excluded as 
the conveyer of the infection, no other satisfactory explana- 
tion has been found to take its place. If a parallelism has 
been ascertained between the level of the ground- water and 
the movement of the disease, no one has been able to explain 
how these two facts are connected together. According to 
my conviction, we know at present a number of things con- 
cerning the causes of infectious diseases, but a clear under- 
standing of the causes of epidemics is wanting the bridges to 
join the bacteriological and the epidemiological phenomena are 
often wanting. Along with further bacteriological laboratory 
researches on the properties of the exciters of infection, 
unprejudiced, many-sided observations of epidemics are of 
great value, especially when they have taken place in small 
localities known in detail to the observer, or at least acces- 
sible to investigation. 

Only we must not forget that good epidemiological observa- 

399 



400 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF AN EPIDEMIC. 

tion must be commenced years "before the epidemic, and must 
be continued yearly. The following scheme will explain the 
course which the investigations have to follow. 

A. Plan of Investigation. 

I. General Observations on the Scene of an Epidemic, 
its Inhabitants and the Meteorological Factors. 

497. 1. General character of the district. Geology, 
altitude, relations to water, character of the superficial 
strata, &c. Compare 154. 

2. The meteorological factors, according to the closest 
possible observations in detail, especially the temperature of 
the air and the soil, height of barometer, downfall, level of 
ground-water, percentage of carbonic acid in the ground-air, 
dependence of the level of ground-water on rainfall or on the 
height of the water of a river. 

3. Hygienic arrangements of the district; state of dwellings, 
water supply, source of food (milk, meat, &c.) ; removal of 
refuse, washing linen, &c. Have there occurred extensive 
excavations, dredgings, &c. ? 

4. The relations of the life and traffic of the inhabitants 
(statistics of occupation, settled population, and intercourse 
with strangers), military and civil population, intercourse 
with neighbouring places, c. (statistics of intercourse). 

As far as the observations can be expressed by maps, plans, 
curves, &c., this should be done, as it will give a much more 
rapid insight than can be obtained from tables. (See 140.) 

II. Special Observations on the Persons Attacked, 
and their Conditions of Dwelling 1 and Living. 

| 498. These observations are collected by means of 
printed schedules of questions, to be filled up by the phy- 
sician attending the case. To facilitate a conspectus they 
may be printed upon papers of various colours, differing 
either according to sex or according to locality, but otherwise 
alike. 



OBSERVATIONS ON PERSONS ATTACKED. 401 

They must contain the following questions : 

1. PERSONALITY OF THE PATIENT. 

Name, fore-name, sex, age, native place. 1 

2. ABODE. 

Street, number of house. 

Story, whether front or back of house. 

In hotels, barracks, &c., number of rooms. 

Since when has the patient lived in the dwelling in 
question, or where did he live recently, or whence has 
come? 

3. CONDITION OF DWELLING. 

Water-supply. 

State of W.C., &c. ; is there any escape of sewage gas ? 
Position of bedrooms. 
Degree of cleanliness of house. 
How many persons per room ? 

Have cases of the same disease occurred previously in the 
same house ? If so, was it disinfected, and how ? 

4. OCCUPATION. 

Where did the patient chiefly remain of late, and where 
did he work, attend school, &c. ? 

What can be ascertained concerning the conditions there, 
in the sense of questions 2 and 3 ? 

5. NUTRITION. 

Whence has milk been procured ? Have substances been 
consumed which seem connected with the present epidemic, 
e.g., artificial mineral waters, &c. ? 

Has the nutrition been good, medium, or insufficient ? If 
another standard for a good position in life is preferred, can 
the density of population serve as such ?

name " is what in Britain is called the Christian name. Editor. 
VOL. II. 2 G 



402 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF AN EPIDEMIC. 

Celli (Central, f. Bdkteriol., \. 159) and Hesse (Zeit. f. Hygiene, v.) have 
shown by methodical researches that a series of pathogenic microbia 
may multiply well, or at least may be maintained for some time upon 
many of our articles of food. The foods were sterilised in a steam-pot, 
inoculated with pure culture, and examined after various intervals of 
time. Meat, raw or boiled, boiled white of egg, and milk are excellent 
media for cultures. Staphylococcus aureus nourishes even upon strongly 
salted sausages. Typhus remains alive on the same substance at least 
for a month, whilst cholera dies in a few hours. Cheese is a poor 
medium for typhus, splenic fever, and staphylococcus, and for cholera 
it is no culture-medium at all. The bacilli of cholera, in contradis- 
tinction to typhus and staphylococcus, can multiply for 2i months upon 
slices of apple and pear. Upon discs of melon the organisms in general 
died off rapidly. 

6. INTERCOURSE. 

Has direct personal contact occurred with sick persons, 
e.g., attendance upon those attacked with illness ? 

Has there been indirect intercourse with the sick, i.e., 
with persons engaged in attendance upon patients, or have 
the persons attacked come in contact with articles used or 
soiled by the sick, e.g., linen ? 

7. MANNER OF INFECTION. 

How, where, and whereby does the patient believe he has 
been attacked, or can he say on this point nothing definite ? 

Day when taken ill, or supposed day of infection, if such 
can be given. 

8. SPECIAL STATEMENTS. 

E.g., since the commencement of the epidemic the patient 
has drunk no unboiled water ; patient has been engaged for 
weeks in disinfecting infected houses. 



III. Bacteriological Observations. 

499. Occasionally, e.g., in cholera, bacteriological ex- 
aminations of the dejections may be necessary or desirable 
for the diagnosis. 

Search for the exciting cause of the infection, as far as 
it is known, should be made in all places where it is to 
be expected for general or special reasons, i.e., examination 



UTILISATION OF THE OBSERVATIONS. 403 

of soil, air, water, ceilings, linen, milk, and possibly other 
foods. A main condition for success is very prompt and, as 
far as possible, multiplied investigation. A division of the 
duty among several inquirers will in most cases be requisite. 
If the direct detection fails researches may still be de- 
sirable, e.g., whether the supposed exciter of the infection 
can maintain itself or increase in a given water, and other 
biological studies. 

B. Utilisation of the Observations. 

500. When the material of the enumeration papers is 
completed, it is utilised by arranging it successively accord- 
ing to the most different points of view. We may, e.g., arrange 
the papers according to streets and quarters, or, again, ac- 
cording to altitudes, or to water-supply, &c., and thus quickly 
ascertain the prevalence of the disease under the most varied 
conditions. The results obtained are tabulated or plotted 
out graphically. 

When in possession of all these results we may endeavour 
to answer the following questions : 

I. Whence is the epidemic originally derived ? How are 
the first attacks connected with those in other places and 
among themselves ? What was the route of introduction ? 
Have men or inanimate objects effected the introduction ? 

II. What is the relation between the increase and decrease 
of the epidemic in general, or in its several chief foci, to the 
progress of the meteorological factors, and to the rise and 
fall of the ground- water (all shown graphically) ? 

III. Are the cases of the disease grouped locally in any 
perceptible manner, or are certain districts especially at- 
tacked ? 

a. If yes, what is the cause of this localisation, or what is 
the relation of the most severely visited places (streets, 
houses) to those which have escaped from the follow- 
ing points of view : 

1. Position in altitude or depth, in a hollow, on a 
steep declivity, on a high flat, &c. 



404 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF AN EPIDEMIC. 

2. Permeable or non-permeable subsoil, purity and 

moisture of soil. 

3. Supply of drinking-water. 

4. Drainage. 

5. Supply of milk. 

6. Density of population and degree of comfort. 

Isolation of the houses. 

7. Occupations. 

8. Intercourse with strangers. 

I. If no, can any other regular factor be recognised in the 
occurrence of the attacks of the disease ? e.g., 

1. Are certain ages attacked ? 

2. Are certain occupations attacked ? 

o. Can there be found among those attacked any 
common disposing cause (e.g., insufficient 
nourishment) ? 

The questions under b must be considered, even if striking 
localisations of the disease are found to exist. 

IY. As a supplement to the inquiry in how far the 
localities attacked are distinguished by any characteristic 
from those which have escaped, the following consideration 
may serve : I )o quarters or districts, provided with the 
same hygienic arrangements and exposed to the same danger, 
differ in the frequency of the attacks ? Such considerations 
are especially needful if the studies described under III. 
seem to have revealed any regularity, e.g., rendered it pro- 
bable that a certain water-supply is to blame for the 
attacks. In such a case the following points have to be 
weighed : 

Are all the houses, streets, or town-quarters supplied with 
the water in question similarly attacked ? 

a. If this is the case have they possibly, besides the water- 
supply, such a similarity in their situation, inhabitants, 
degree of cleanliness, that the water is not necessarily the 
cause of the disease. 

b. If this is not the case may the surprising fact that 
single public buildings, hospitals, &c., remained free from 
attack though supplied with the same water, be explained 



BIBLIOGRAPHY. 405 

by the supposition that the water was not drunk at all, 
or only after it had been boiled, &c. 

All the results obtained in Section III. have to be tested 
with a similar scepticism; unfortunately such scepticism 
leads almost always to the unsatisfactory answer that a 
definite channel of infection cannot be demonstrated in this 
manner with absolute certainty. 

V. Bacteriological results may be of decisive significance 
for a full explanation of the epidemic, but in order to reach 
full certainty it must be here logically demanded that the 
exciting cause must not have 'been present before and after 
the epidemic, as well as during its continuance.

SECTION XX. 

EXAMINATION OF AND DECISION ON DIS- 
INFECTIVE AGENTS AND DISINFECTIVE 
APPARATUS. 

I. Chemical Disinfectants. 

501. All disinfectants are applied either in the gaseous 
state or in solution in water. It is the purpose of the in- 
vestigation to determine how great the percentage of the air 
or the water can be to the disinfective agent, in order that 
it may effect its purpose in the time desired. Earlier ex- 
periments with chemical disinfectants have often yielded too 
favourable results not always in agreement with each other, 
since a number of the more minute experimental conditions 
have been discovered only of late years. 

Four grades 1 of an unfavourable effect upon micro-organisms are 
conceivable, according to 

1. The growth is not disturbed, but the pathogenic, zymogenic, &c., 
functions are enfeebled. Enfeeblement, Mitigation. 

2. The organisms can no longer multiply, but they are not killed. 



3. The vegetative states of the micro-organisms are destroyed, but 
not the enduring forms (spores). Antisepsis. 

4. The vegetative and spore forms are killed. 

Sterilisation or Disinfection. 

An enfeeblement is intentionally produced only for strictly defined 
purposes (obtaining protective inoculative matters). We do not dis- 
criminate between 3 and 4. In general we wish to obtain by our 
operations complete disinfection. 

For experiments in disinfection we use chiefly the bacilli 
and the spores of splenic fever, the bacilli of typhus, 

1 As the first indication of an attack we observe a retarded development 
when transferred to a good nutrient medium (heat, cold, and chemicals act 
in this manner). 



4o8 DECISION ON DISINFECTIVE AGENTS. 

the vibrios of cholera, and Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus ; 
sometimes, also, if it is required to test the maximum per- 
formance, there are employed spores of certain saprophytes, 
e.g., those of the hay bacillus, of Mesentericus vulgatus, of the 
spores of bacilli inhabiting garden soil. 

Temperature exerts a twofold influence. On the one 
hand it strengthens the fungicide action of the antiseptics 
hitherto tried (Henle, Behring); secondly, it allows the 
bacteria more readily to overcome the inhibitive power of 
small quantities of disinfectants (Behring), the aseptic action 
is reduced, whilst the antiseptic property is heightened. 

The disinfective action differs also in different nutrient 
media. Thus the bacilli of splenic fever, if suspended in 
water, are quickly destroyed at a concentration of 1 : 500,000 ; 
in broth at 1:40,000, and in blood-serum at 1 in 2000 
(Behring). 

Von Esmarcli lias shown that spores of splenic fever obtained from 
different cultures at different times possess very different resistance 
against chemical and thermic action (Zeit. f. Hygiene, v. 71). A great 
number of specimens were found perfectly dead on the fourth day t 
in 5 per cent, carbolic water ; others were still alive after sixteen 
to twenty-one days, and one even after forty-two days. The resistance 
against currents of steam varies in a similar manner. Every investi- 
gator, therefore, who tests a new disinfectant on the spores of splenic 
fever should state what is the resistance of the spores employed against 
carbolic acid. Or, preferably, as C. Friinkel mentions (Zeit. f. Jlygicne, 
vi., pp. 524 and 525), the different powers of resistance are handed 
down as a racial peculiarity, only extremely resistant spores should 
be used for such experiments. Friinkel names the bacilli which 
remained alive in 5 per cent, carbolic acid for less than ten days, 
" feebly resistant " ; those which remain alive from ten to twenty days, 
"medium resistant" ; those which survive from twenty to forty days, 
" highly resistant " ; and those which live for longer than forty days, 
" extremely resistant." 

Disinfection by means of gases has proved unsatisfactory ; 
sulphurous acid, chlorine, and bromine act only in very large 
doses and on prolonged application. On the technical details 
of these experiments, which for practical purposes do not 
need repetition, see Mittheilungen ans clem k. Gestmdheitsamt, 
Proskauer on " Sulphurous Acid," vol. i. p. 234 ; Fischer and 



CONCENTRATION WHICH INSURES ASEPSIS. 409 

Proskauer on " Chlorine and Bromine," vol. ii. p. 228 ; 
Buchner, Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, 1887, vol. ii. No. 12. 

On the other hand, the disinfectant power of liquids has 
had to be tested for practical purposes, and still every year 
some new disinfectants are introduced into commerce. 



1. Determination of the Concentration which insures 

Asepsis. 

502. We prepare, e.g., a 10 per cent, solution of the 
disinfectant, and add respectively 1, 0'5, - 3, 0*1 cc. to each 
10 cc. of liquid gelatine. The tubes then contain each 1 per 
cent., 0-5 per cent., 0'3 per cent. O'l per cent, of the dis- 
infectant; we then make up plunge or smear cultures and 
plates with the microbe in question. The same experiment 
is then repeated, using broth in place of gelatine as a 
nutrient medium. We may also inoculate the disinfected 
nutrient medium with mere sporiferous material, which has 
been previously freed from all bacilli by heating to 70 for 
half-an-hour, and observe whether the spores develop to 
cultures. 

Behring has given this examination the following practical 
form : We take from the infected liquid nutrient medium 
to be tested, e.g., serum, a drop, and enclose it with a little 
vaseline hanging in a port-object ground concave on the 
lower side of a cover-glass. Then known quantities of the 
disinfectant, larger and larger, are added by degrees to the 
nutrient medium, repeating the installation of a drop culture 
after every addition and vigorous shaking. After 24 or 2 -24 
hours' stay in the incubation stove we may satisfy ourselves 
by means of the microscope concerning the growth in the 
several drops. 

2. Determination of the Concentration which insures 

Antisepsis. 

503. We cultivate the microbes in question in broth, 
filter before spores have been formed, and use the filtrate 
as in 502, with certain quantities of the disinfectant of 



410 DECISION ON DISINFECT! VE AGENTS. 

known strength. The filtration is effected through asbestos, 
and its object is to remove clots of bacilli. From these 
tubes we take, after the expiry of 1 minute, 5 minutes, 
10, 15, 30 minutes, and 1 hour, a small platinum loop of 
material, introduce each into 10 cc. of liquefied gelatine, 
and form plates. We thus obtain such results as the follow- 
ing: x per cent, of the disinfectant kills in 20 minutes, 
y per cent, in 1 minute, &c. If we suspect that the trace 
of disinfectant conveyed in the loop may have simulated 
the destruction of the microbes by rendering growth in the 
gelatine impossible, we check the result by inoculation with 
fresh microbiferous material or gelatine, to which has been 
added a similar loop full of the liquid to be disinfected at 
the same degree of dilution. 

It must not be forgotten that bacteria enfeebled by disinfective action 
are more sensitive to the presence of traces of disinfectant in a nutrient 
medium than fresh spores (Geppert). 

The error of the simultaneous introduction of small quanti- 
ties of disinfectives may be avoided if we infect larger 
quantities of broth; e.g., 100 cc. instead of 10 cc. of gelatine, 
and then place the culture-flask in the incubation niche. 
On the one hand the quantity of disinfectant is thus enor- 
mously diluted, and 011 the other an optimum temperature 
is supplied to the bacteria (Behring). It must be urgently 
desired that this method should always be used as a check 
on the gelatine plates. 

Cocci and bacilli without spores have been dried upon 
silk threads or bits of filter-paper in the exsiccator and 
examined like the sporiferous preparations ( 504). This 
method does not seem to deserve recommendation. 

Geppert has lately shown that frequently when an ex- 
amination by culture experiments showed a destruction of 
the micro-organisms (spores of splenic fever), the simul- 
taneous inoculation of animals proved fatal to the latter. 
Hence follows the necessity of checking the results obtained 
in culture experiments by experiments upon animals. 
Behring found the contrary. 



EXAMINATION OF THE SPORICIDE POWER. 411 



3. Examination of the Sporicide Power. 

504. Sporiferous materials have hitherto been used 
dried on silk threads. (See for the preparation of such 
threads, 74.) The silk threads are placed for a known 
time in capsules of water, to which definite quantities of 
the disinfectant have been added. The threads were then 
taken out, washed by shaking them in sterilised water, 
and pressed into a glass box lined with agar. It was then 
placed in the incubation-niche, and the growth or the 
germination, if it occurred, was observed. 

The early experiments of Nageli and H. Buchner have 
shown that under circumstances an impure result is obtained, 
when particles of the nutrient medium upon which the 
spores were cultivated envelop them on the silk thread and 
protect them against the action of the sporicide agent. The 
results then cause the effects of the disinfectant to appear 
too little favourable. Geppert has recently proved that an 
inverse error may occur ; e.g., silk threads absorb very 
rapidly so much solution of mercuric chloride that it 
cannot be removed by simply washing. The spores then, 
when introduced into gelatine, fail to germinate, not be- 
cause they are dead, but because the surrounding gelatine 
is rendered aseptic by the mercuric chloride which diffuses 
into it. 

We work, therefore, now generally with sporiferous liquids, 
i.e., with a suspension in sterilised broth of a sporiferous 
" lawn " which has been cultivated upon agar. It is easily 
obtained by pouring a little broth upon an agar cultivation 
held in a sloping position, passing the needle lightly over 
the surface of the "lawn," and filtering the emulsion 
through glass wool. This liquid may then be treated 
exactly according to 2. 

More like the method with silk threads is a desiccation of the watery 
suspension on sterilised cover-glasses or pieces of platinum wire. These 
objects, after remaining for a time in the disinfective liquid, may be 
perfectly freed from any adhering traces of the disinfectant by a thorough 



412 DECISION ON DISINFECTIVE AGENTS. 

washing with water or alcohol. Ammonium sulphide and sulphuretted 
hydrogen have recently been used for removing mercuric chloride 
(Geppert). 

505. Along with these methods of investigation which 
form an indispensable basis for a decision upon and a com- 
parison of the several means, experiments are necessary 
which belong intimately with hygienic practice. Thus 
experiments have to be made with actual soiled linen, with 
fasces artificially mixed with cholera bacilli, with the entire 
sputum of phthisical patients ; in such experiments consider- 
ably larger quantities of the disinfectant are always found 
necessary than with pure cultures. 

In order that a chemical disinfectant may be recommended 
to the general public for universal use, it must 

1. Produce quick sterilisation even when the agents 
of infection are mixed with large quantities of organic 
substances. 

2. It must be cheap, easy to procure and to keep. 

3. It must not be a strong poison. Properties are de- 
sirable such as a remarkable smell or an unpleasant 
taste, which may serve as a caution against its ingestion. 
Of course too intense an odour becomes an objection to 
its use. 

4. Its action must be easily observed. This property is 
met with in acids and powerful alkalies ; thus milk of lime 
added to a stool in such proportions as to turn red litmus- 
paper decidedly blue is sufficient, according to Pfuhl, in the 
course of an hour, for the certain disinfection of an added 
mixture of typhus and cholera bacilli. 

5. The objects to be disinfected must be damaged as little 
as possible. 

A disinfectant fulfilling all these requirements has not 
hitherto been discovered. Mercuric chloride along with 
acids, quicklime, chlorine, and preparations of phenol and 
cresol, contest among themselves for superiority. 

The special requirements for surgical, &c., disinfectants 
cannot be here considered. 



DISINFECTION BY HEAT. 41 3 

II. Disinfection by Heat. 

506. Disinfection by heat may be effected 

1. By ignition or combustion. 

2. By boiling in water. 

3. By dry hot air. 

4. By steam. 

1. Ignition can be endured without injury only by pla- 
tinum; the other metals and articles of glass are easily 
injured. Hence this method plays a great part in the labora- 
tory, but not in practice (53). Worthless articles, such as old 
clothing, rags, straw from beds, toys, &c., are simply burnt in 
preference, in order to destroy any adhering micro-organisms. 

2. Boiling in water or in a weak solution of soda is very 
practical for a number of articles, thus, e.g., surgical instru- 
ments are most simply and certainly sterilised in this manner. 

3. Dry hot air is now used only in special cases, since only 
temperatures (140-150) which already char vegetable 
tissues destroy the more resistent spores in a short time (30 
minutes). Hot air is used in the laboratory for the disinfec- 
tion (53) of glass vessels, instruments, wadding, paper. In 
practice apparatus is no longer constructed for disinfec- 
tion by hot air. Occasionally, however, a baker's oven, if its 
use can be obtained gratuitously, may serve, if not for the 
destruction of the spores of splenic fever, for killing the non- 
sporiferous bacteria of cholera, typhus, and diphtheria, and 
especially of animal vermin. 

4. The method of practical disinfection now universally in 
use consists in the application of hot watery vapour. The 
simplest apparatus of this kind approximates closely to 
Koch's steam-pot ( 53). The objects are left for a certain 
time in steam ascending from boiling water and escaping at 
an aperture above. (Disinfection in a current of steam.) If 
only so much steam enters as to replace that lost by conden- 
sation, we speak of disinfection by stagnant steam. There 
exist a series of apparatus (in contradistinction to those 
described in which the steam acts at the pressure of the 



414 DECISION ON DISINFECTIVE AGENTS. 

atmosphere) constructed for the use of steam at a tension of 
from ^g- to 2 atmospheres. In these apparatus, after the air 
has been expelled, the aperture for the exit of the steam is 
closed by a safety-valve, which allows a transitory escape of 
steain only when the desired tension is exceeded. 

507. If it is desired to obtain a steam-disinfecting 
apparatus, such as are now to be procured in many different 
designs and sizes at very different prices, from a large series 
of establishments, attention must be given to the following 
points. (According to E. von Esmarch, Dcsinfections apparate 
und ihre Amvcndung. Hyy- Rundschau, 1891, No. I. 1 ) 

1. In general we prefer an apparatus without tension, or 
one not exceeding -^ to -^ atmosphere. Steam of a higher 
tension certainly acts more quickly, since the objects sooner 
reach a temperature of 100. These advantages, however, are 
more than compensated by the disadvantage of the necessity 
for a more solid construction of the apparatus, of procuring 
a steam boiler and trustworthy heater. The steam is prefer- 
ably allowed to enter from above, since the heavier cold air 
is thus easily expelled. 

2. The apparatus are most conveniently made of iron 
coated with oil-colour. If high-pressure steam is used, the 
thickness of the sides must not be less than 3 mm. Apparatus 
of wood and stone are not to be recommended ; if of wood 
they are certainly cheap but not durable, if of stone they 
are neither cheap nor durable, and they are very costly in 
use, on account of their great absorption of heat, unless kept 
in constant action. It is advisable to have the apparatus 
jacketed with some material which is a poor conductor of 
heat. 

3. The shape has no fundamental importance. Horizontal 
cylinders, round or oval, are relatively cheap, but in them 



1 It is very important for the steam to be saturated. Non-saturated steain, 
though strongly heated, acts badly. A full steam-temperature exists in the 
objects to be disinfected only as far as water is condensed. The condensation 
zone moves forward towards the interior of the packages in a sharp line 
(Teuscher, Frosch, and Clarenbach). 



DISINFECTION BY HEAT. 415 

the space is not so well utilisable; rectangular horizontal 
chests have the opposite qualities. 

4. Apparatus for detached hospitals should not contain 
less than 2 cm. Larger hospitals and small towns require an 
apparatus of 5 cm. capacity, or two holding 2 cm. each. It 
is often very desirable to have a movable apparatus, such as 
are now manufactured in abundance. 

5. The steam may be introduced either directly below or 
at the side. Apparatus (Thursfield) in which the water- 
boiler incloses the disinfecting space like a jacket permit of 
an inexpensive preliminary heating of the space. The steam 
is often obtained from a source which is already existing (e.g., 
in manufactories). 

6. Many apparatus admit of heating the disinfecting space 
independently of the entrance of steam by means of closed 
steam-worms. Thus before disinfection we may obtain a 
preliminary heating, and after it a desiccation of the objects. 

Yon Esrnarch regards the preliminary and the subsequent 
heating, which extend the duration of the disinfective process 
to double the time (from 20 to 40 minutes), as not absolutely 
necessary, and as certainly to be dispensed with in time of 
epidemics, when the apparatus is in great requisition. How- 
ever, bed feathers retain immediately when taken out from 
3 to 5 per cent, of moisture, and merely fractions of a per 
cent, if dried. Inferior qualities are often rendered hard 
and lumpy by this retention of moisture. Good ventilation 
may also, however, approximately expel this residual moisture. 
As to the erection of the apparatus, we must consider 

7. The apparatus must be set up in a thoroughly ventilated 
room, as it will otherwise be rendered permanently damp. 

8. If it is necessary to work regularly with a large appara- 
tus, two rooms are necessary, one for the articles to be dis- 
infected and one for those already disinfected. The apparatus 
is best placed so that it is fitted with the middle of its 
longitudinal diameter into the wall separating the two 
rooms. At each end there is a door. The articles to be 
disinfected are introduced through the door in the room for 
holding such articles, and those already disinfected are 



416 DECISION OF DISINFECTIVE AGENTS. 

emptied into the room for disinfected objects. There must 
be no other access from the one room to the other save 
through the apparatus. 

In working the arrangement it is requisite that 
(1.) The articles to be disinfected must not receive any 
spots. Kust-spots will be avoided if all the metal baskets 
for containing the articles are carefully wrapped round with 
linen or flannel. Finer articles (body linen, light-coloured 
clothes, &c.) must be inclosed in linen bags as a protection 
against drops of condensed water. The firmness of the 
tissues does not suffer, but various tones of colour, impressed 
patterns, &c., disappear. 

2. Old articles which have contracted a fusty smell must 
not be disinfected along with new clothing, &c., since the 
latter often take up the disagreeable smell. 

508. Strictly speaking the examination of the capability 
of a disinfecting apparatus may be effected in a twofold 
manner, either by means of the contact thermometer, or 
with cultivations of bacteria. It is preferable to use both 
these procedures simultaneously. If we wish to use the 
contact thermometer we place it in the midst of a thick 
bundle of blankets, such as they might be rolled up in 
practical disinfection. 

If the temperature rises to 100 the circuit is closed and 
the signal-bell sounds. We then know what length of time 
is required until the temperature necessary for the destruc- 
tion of the spores has been reached. From this time the 
articles must remain in the apparatus for about twenty 
minutes. For thoroughgoing experiments several contact 
thermometers are naturally used at once, in order to obtain 
;in accurate representation of the distribution of the tem- 
perature in space. Simple thermometers for reading off, 
and maximum thermometers to be read off after the experi- 
ment, do good service. The temperature of the steam 
entering or escaping, and in apparatus working at high 
pressure, the indications of the manometer are useful as 
checks. 



MECHANICAL DISINFECTION. 417 

If we have no contact-thermometer at disposal which 
ought to be attached to every disinfection apparatus we in- 
troduce into the interior of a. roll of blankets slices of potato, 
with sporiferous cultures of splenic fever, small packets of 
sporiferous garden soil, wrapped up in sterilised paper, and 
withdraw them from the apparatus in fixed successive 
experiments, i.e., after 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 minutes from the 
beginning of the appearance of steam, and we examine the 
vitality and the virulence of the heated bacteria by means 
of cultures and experiments on animals. In from thirty to 
forty minutes, after the appearance of steam, the resistant 
spores of splenic fever ought to be dead. It seems unjustifi- 
able to declare an apparatus bad which does not quickly 
destroy the most resistant spores (hay-bacillus, bacilli from 
garden soil), for which high-pressure steam is needed. 1 We 
may regard it as certain that the unknown exciters of 
the diseases not as yet thoroughly setiologically investigated 
(measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, &c.) will not be more 
resistant than the spores of splenic fever. If such resistant 
spores of splenic fever are destroyed in from thirty to forty- 
five minutes from the beginning of heating, if the cost of the 
apparatus is not too high, its construction substantial, and 
the consumption of fuel moderate, the apparatus may be 
recommended, always supposing that the articles to be disin- 
fected leave the apparatus dry, without spots or other damage. 

This is not the place to enter upon the reasons why the 
various apparatus act differently well, and cheaply ; the 
biblographical indications give sufficient indications on this 
subject. 

III. Mechanical Disinfection. 

509. It is sometimes possible simply to remove the 
micro-organisms without killing them. This principle comes 
especially into play in rubbing the walls with black bread, 
which has been found successful by Yon Esmarch. It is 
easy to satisfy ourselves of the efficacy of this method after 



1 On the sensitiveness of various bacilli to heat see 303 and 53. 
VOL. II. 2 D 



4i 8 DECISION OF DISINFECT! VE AGENTS, 

rubbing. 1 The ventilation of sick-rooms may also be re- 
garded as mechanical disinfection, though its efficacy cannot 
be readily shown by experiment,

APPENDICES. 



THE following pages supply all important advances relating to the 
subject of the present work which have been made during the 
progress of the translation, up to January 1st, 1893. 

K. B. LEHMANN. 

47. Botkin greatly recommends Gram's method of rinsing the sec- 
tions with aniline water after taking them out of the aniline-water 
gentiana-violet solution before introduction into iodised potassium 
iodide. Such preparations bear the subsequent treatment with alcohol 
much better (Central. f. Bakt., xi. No. 8). 

60. Reinsch recommends nutrient albuminiferous media sterilised 
with ether in the cold (Central. /. Bakt., xi. 30). 

65. On improvising in bacteriological work compare the note- 
worthy article by Von Esmarck (Hygien. Rundschau, ii. 653). 

79. Wassermann and Proskauer suspect that the toxalbumens are 
not albumenoid bodies, but merely substances precipitated along with 
albuminous bodies. Various authors also incline to this opinion. 

83. For further micrococci with spontaneous movement see Central, 
f. Bakt., vi. 566 ; vii. 637 ; xii. 49. A Sarcina with spontaneous move- 
ment has also been discovered. 

83. On Streptococcus longus compare Behring (Central. f. Bakt., xii. 
No. 6). 

83. Jordan has observed two cases of erysipelas occasioned by 
Stapliylococcus (Langenbeck's Archiv, xlii., 1892). 

83. Leuconostoc mesenterioides grows upon nutrient media free from 
sugar, without membranaceous coatings, after the manner of a Strepto- 
coccus (Liesenberg and Zopf, Central, f. Bakt., xii. 659). 

84. The typhus bacillus is still, as formerly, especially difficult to 
diagnose if mixed with other bacteria. Dunbar (Zeit. f. Hygiene, xiii.) 
has shown that all the methods hitherto recommended for obtaining 
typhus cultures by additions of acids, phenol, &c., in order to check 
the development of other bacteria, have only a very limited utility, 
since Bac. coli communis, which is never absent in the bowel, is still 

more resistant against injuries. Further, Bac. coli communis upon such 

419 



420 APPENDIX. 

prepared media grows more similar to the typhus bacillus than other- 
wise. As Bac. coli communis has spontaneous motility, and presents 
flagella, we must use for a differential diagnosis, according to Dunbar 
in the first place the circumstances that (1) Bac. coli communis coagu- 
lates milk, which the typhus bacillus does not ; (2) Bac. coli communis 
forms gas in ordinary bouillon, whilst the typhus bacillus does not. 

Ferrati's results are quite similar (Arch. f. Hygiene, xvi. 1). Also 
Weyland, who compared the formation of C0 2 in broth by the typhus 
bacillus, in bouillon with that of a bacillus resembling that of typhus, 
observed in the former a much smaller quantity of C0 2 (Arcli.f. Hygiene, 
xiv., part iv.). 

85. Arens discovered in my laboratory a method of detecting a 
few cholera spirilla in water. To 175 cc. of the suspected water he 
adds 25 cc. of Karlinski's pancreas broth (200 grm. ox-pancreas, 500 cc. 
distilled water, 20 grm. Witte's peptone) and 1 cc. of potassa-lye at 10 
per cent. The whole is placed in the incubation niche. After from 
twenty-four to thirty-six hours a very thin greyish veil can be noticed 
on the surface of the liquid, consisting entirely of spirilla. To ascer- 
tain if the cholera spirilla are present in this veil, firstly pancreas 
bouillon, diluted with from eight to ten volumes of water, is infected 
with it, to test for indol, and secondly plates are made up with it, so 
as to get a pure culture of the spirillum. 

By this means Arens was certain to find two cholera germs in 5 cc. 
of water, and almost certain to find one germ in 5 cc. Heim and 
Dahmeii have published similar methods (Central./. Bald., xii., pp. 353 
and 620). 

$ 85. On the morphology of the cholera bacilli compare Frieclrich 
(Arl>. anf; dcm I'ais. Gesundheitsamt, vol. viii.), and Douglas Cunningham 
(" Scientific Memoirs of Medical Officers of the Army of India," part 
vi., and Arcli.f. Hygiene, xiv. 45). 

85. According to Gamaleia (La Semaine 3[edicale, 1892, No. 3D), 
the dog is very susceptible to cholera. 

$ 85. Concerning the behaviour of the cholera bacilli upon fruit, 
drinks, tobacco, bread, &c., compare 1'akt. Central., xii., pp. 755 and 913. 

$ 80. Richard Pfeiffer describes the exciter of influenza as a fine 
bacillus, generally associated in pairs, and capable of being stained 
with carbolic magenta, but not by Gram's method. 

The bacillus grows with certainty only if a little blood preferably 
normal human blood is rubbed down upon agar congealed in a 
slanting position, and mixed with \\ per cent, of sugar. A brood 
temperature is necessary. The culture is best obtained from a smear- 
preparation of the sputa of influenza-patients, diluted with broth free 
from germs. The colonies form small drops, clear as water, which 
reach their full growth in forty-eight hours, and (not confluent) die oil' 



APPENDIX. 421 

in from four to five days. These organisms are very readily killed by 
dryness (twenty to twenty-four hours), heat (five minutes at 66). 
According to Pfeiffer the only animal susceptible to the disease is the 
ape. Pfeiffer and Beck (Deutsch. med. Wochenschrift, 1882, No. 21), 
Pfuhl (Central./. Bakt., xi., No. 13). 

86. A rather circumstantial but alleged excellent method for 
detecting the bacilli of tubercle in milk has been given by Tekewitsch 
(Miinch. med. Wochenschrift, 1892, No. 5). Kitasato (Zeit. f. Hygiene, 
xi. 441) and Pastor (Central, f. Bakt., xi., No. 8) give instructions for 
cultivating tubercle bacilli from human sputum. 

86. J. Forster has very carefully examined the resistance of the 
tubercle bacilli to heat, using very eligible methods. 
At 55 they die in four hours (not in three). 
At 60 one hour (not in three-quarters). 
At 70 ten minutes. 
At from 80 to 90 in five minutes. 
At 95 in one minute. 

Similar but rather lower resistances have been found by Bonhoff 
(loc. cit., 1009 ; Hygien. Rundschau, ii. 



86. Maffucci has described the bacillus of chicken cholera very 
thoroughly (Zeit. f. Hygiene, 1892, xi. 445). 



87. Klein (Central, f. Bald., x., No. 6) and Sanfelice (Annal del ind. 
d'lyien di Roma, vol. i., fasc. iv., 1892) describe an aerobic pseudo- 
( edema bacillus. The last work contains much interesting matter on 
anaerobic bacilli. 

On Actinomycosis compare Woepf and Israel (Virchow Archiv, cxxvi. 
11). Gruber describes a new pathogenic microbe of the group of 
Actinomyces : Micromyces Hofmani (Arch./. Hygiene, xvi.). 

91. On the technics of the examination of the Hyphomycetes 
compare Unna (Central, f. Bakt., 1892, No. 11). Unna now knows and 
describes nine exciters of favus (Central, f. Bakt., xiii. 1). 

91. Roux, G., and Linossier, G., have made new investigations on 
the "soor" fungus, in which they show a kind of formation of 
chlamydospores. They dispute a connection with Monilia Candida 
(Arch, de Med. experimentale, 1890). 

93. Schottelius has described in a very careful study a peculiar 
organism which he considers as the exciter of foot-and-mouth disease, 
and which he names Streptocythen. This organism consists of globes 
of unequal size, grouped together in the form of a rake. The terminal 
members have an amoeboid movement. Single globules possess a 
peculiar spontaneous motility. They are most readily stained according 
to Gram's method. They grow sparingly and slowly upon glycerine- 
agar and glycerine-broth in the shape of tender, almost translucent, 



422 APPENDIX. 

pearly-grey colonies. The transfer to animals has been hitherto 
unsuccessful (Central./. Bakt., xi., Nos. 2 and 4). 

On Dysentery compare Councilman, W. P., " The Form of Dysenteria 
produced by Amceba coli" (Journal of American Medical Association, 
June 6, 1891). According to the researches of Maggiora there is also 
a flux (or form of flux) which has nothing in common with the dysen- 
tery ainojba), but rather seems determined by a virulent form of 
Bacillus coli communis. JMaggiora only once found amoeba? among 
2000 patients from the province of Alessandria (Central, f. JJakt., xi., 
Nos. 6 and 7). 

In dysentery in South Japan Ogata never found amoeba*, but fine, 
short bacilli in pure cultures. They liquefied gelatine, and could be 
transferred to animals (Centra?./. Bakt.j xi., Xos. 9 and 10). 

J5 93. For the examination of the higher fungi are recommended : 
Ludwig, F. (Leltrbuch der niedcren Cryptogamen, Stuttgart, 1892), and 
Von Tavel ( Vergleichende Morphologic der Pihe, Jena, 1892). 

In both these works the recent researches of Brefeld are placed in 
the foreground. 

On the process of fermentation thorough information is found in 
A. Koch (Jahresberichte iilicr die Fortschritte in der Lehre von den Gahrungs 
tiryatrismen). Two yearly issues have appeared. Braunschweig. 1891 
and 1892. 

$ 135. In order to try if a solution of sodium thiosulphate is still 
good, it is mixed with iodine until the colour becomes slightly yellow, 
when on the addition of barium chloride no precipitate of barium 
.sulphate should appear. 

S 149. Georg Buclmer has instituted extended investigations on the 
proportion of CO- in the atmosphere (Wollmjs Fnrsclmugen auf den 
Gebiet tier Agriculturphysik, xv., Xos. 3 and 4), which supply com- 
parative values useful to the liygienist.

the lowest possible temperatures are recommended. 

$ 191. G. Bucliner (('hem. Zeituwj, 1892, p. 1954) }>oints out that 
in determining the hardness of water with soap the experiment should 
be made at 15 J . Lower temperatures decrease the consumption of soap, 
and higher temperatures increase it very considerably. 

$ 201. For the possibility but the great improbability of the occur- 
rence of epidemics by drinking-water, evidence is given by the experi- 
ments of Schonwerth, who repeatedly infected a well with chicken- 
cholera, and allowed fowls to use the water (Arch. f. Hygiene, xv., 
part i.).

determination of nitrogen can be very conveniently used for a deter- 
mination of carbon. 

227. The following simple recognition of boric acid deserves recom- 
mendation : The liquid in question is rendered alkaline, evaporated 
down, and incinerated. The ash is extracted with water, cautiously 
acidulated with weak hydrochloric acid, and reduced to dryness. laying 
in it a small slip of turmeric paper. The dry turmeric paper shows a 
cherry red colour, which if moistened with alkalies passes into a bluish 
green. Brand, G/iem. Zeitung Hep., 1892, p. 350. 

234. Tappeiner and Brandl found, in chemical dietetic experiments 
on the dog, that on the prolonged ingestion of doses of from (VI to 
0'9 grrti. sodium fluoride, stiffness of the position of the vertebral 
column gradually appeared. Much fluorine is stored up in the body, 
especially in the bones, as calcium fluoride. Hence sodium fluoride 
cannot by any means be regarded as an indifferent preservative agent 
(Arch. /. experim. Path., xxviii.). 

239. Mai jean distinguishes meat which has been frozen from normal 
meat by examining a little blood from the interior of the meat. 
Freezing deforms and decolourises the blood-corpuscles ; the serum 
takes a dark colour. Despatch in manipulation is necessary (Ghem. 
Zeitung Rep., xvi. 133). 

247. Distomum lanceolatum has hitherto been observed only four 
times in man. 

248. On Pentastomum denticulatum see Ostertag (Zeit. /. Fleisch- 
und Milch Hygiene, ii. part iv.). 

249. On tuberculosis in the carnivora, compare Jensen (Deutsche 
Znt. f. Thier. Med., xvii. part iv.). 

256. Ostertag (Zeit. f. Fleisch und Milch Hygiene} takes a decided 
position against the too strict treatment of the flesh of cattle with 
localised tuberculosis, as often from 30 to 50 per cent., according to 
the result of trial inoculations, must be characterised as tuberculous. 
According to Rockl (Arb. des k. Gesundheitsamts, vii. parts ii. and iii.), 
the proportions are much more favourable. 

Ostertag even pleads for the harmlessness of meat if there are found 
in the spleen, lungs, and liver, single (embolic), dry, old tubercular 
nodes, always supposing that the flesh is free (Zeit. f. Fleisch und Milch 
Hygiene, ii. part i.). 



424 APPENDIX. 

256. Kastner, under the advice of Bellinger, has sought to explain 
the difference of his results (mentioned in the text) on the inoculation 
of guinea-pigs with the expressed muscular juice of tuberculous animals 
from those of Steinheil. Kastner's earlier experiments were made 
with the flesh of beasts suffering from the ordinary calcifying type of 
cattle tuberculosis. The recent experiments which gave chiefly posi- 
tive results were made with the flesh of cattle, which contained 
casifying nodes (the ordinary form in man, rare in oxen). 

258. Segers describes chronic poisoning among the Fuegians by 
poisonous mussels. Cirrhosis of the liver is the most prominent 
symptom (Semaine Medic., 1891, No. 54). 

266. On the proportion of saltpetre and common salt in salt meat, 
compare Nothwang (Arch. f. Hygiene, xvi. 122). The loss of albumen 
in salting is from 1 '5 to 2 per cent. That of P 2 5 , 35 to 50 per cent. 
The nitrous acid found in the brine is explained by the reductive action 
of meat upon the saltpetre.

of Fischel and Enoch (Fortscliritte der Medicin, 1892, No. 8).

is occasioned not alone by fat but by caseine in a very fine state of 
division (Cliem. News, 1892, p. 187).

enteritis, is described by Gaffky (Deutach. Med. Wochensclirift, 1892, 
No. 14).

has given decidedly different results from those of Antze (Arch. f. Exp.

340. The baking powders containing alum and sodium carbonate, 
extensively used in England, disturb the pepsine digestion, according 
to Hehner, and occasion slight illness even in small doses (Society of 
Public Analysts, Oct. 5, 1892). 

340. Tonissari found in meal considerable quantities of caustic 
baryta as a widely diffused addition (!) Numerous cases of illness were 
the consequence of consuming such bread. 

341. In mouldy bread the relative proportion of nitrogen increases 
considerably from the partial disappearance of the carbohydrates. 

349. Oranges superficially stained with Biebrich scarlet are sold in 
Paris as blood oranges. 

356. Herr Wolffin, in my laboratory, could not confirm the state- 
ments of Tichomirow on the detection of extracted tea. 

356. For the analysis of tea see Domergue and Nicolas (Journ. de 
Pharmacie et de C/iemie, 1892, p. 302 ; Chtm. Zeit. Rep., 1892, p. 126).

359. In Belgium falsifications of raw coffee-beans with artificial 
coffee-beans have been detected. 

359. Van Hamel Eoos met with roasted coffee in trade, which had 
been extracted with ether (for the manufacture of coffee extract), and 
then roasted again. It contains only 1 instead of 13 to 14 per cent, of 
fat (Revue Internationale des Falsi/icat., iv. 166).

374. Bertschinger found among twenty-eight Swiss beers none with 
a degree of fermentation up to 48 per cent. ; among eleven celebrated 
German beers exported into Switzerland the degree of fermentation 
ranges from 47'5 to 61'7 per cent. 

384. Since 1891 Germany has adopted a rational wine law which 
meets the demands of hygiene and of national economy. 



426 APPENDIX. 

387. Of late very good results have been obtained by fermenting 
grape juice with noble yeasts. 

390. In the determination of glycerine improvements have been 
effected in the first place by the critical work of Suhr (Arch. /. Hygiene, 
xiv. 305). He combines different new methods, and proceeds as fol- 
lows : He steams to expel the alcohol in part, distils off the glycerine 
from the residue at a reduced atmospheric pressure, precipitates the 
glycerine with benzol chloride (adding potassa-lye) as benzol ester, 
which is filtered off, dried and weighed, or determined volumetrically. 

It is also recommended to titrate with permanganate after distilling 
off the glycerine as above (Fox, Benedict-Zsigmondi, Schaumann). 

391. On the acidity of wine and its determination, compare J. A. 
Mu'ller (Ann. Chini. Phys., 1591, Oth series, xxv. 118). 

^ 393. According to C. Schinitt, wine prepared secundum artcm con- 
tains the sulphurous acid, not as such, but as sulphaldehydic acid, 
which is said to have no action on the organism. 

397. Lintner considers the results of the experiments of Medicus 
and Immerheiser as determined by the use of yeast containing bacteria. 
Dextrine, according to Lintner, cannot be fermented by pure Saccharo- 
myces cerevisice (Ztit.f. Angewandte C/temie, 1892, p. 328). 

401. The degypsifying wines with salts of barium is decidedly to 
be condemned ; also the use of stontium salts is prohibited in France as 
injurious to health. 

403. According to Schaffer and Von Freudenreich, sound natural 
wines free from water contain no bacteria. In artificial wines bacteria 
arc found regularly. 

405. The cliief difference between wine and cider and perry is in 
the absence of tarturic acid in the two latter. The tartaric acid 
may disappear also in grape wines which are diseased or strongly 
plastered. 

408. On absinthe see Sohet (Revue Intermit, dcs Falsifications, 
iv. 110). 



8 417-419. Rubner (Arrh. f. Iltjgicn^ xv. 29) has enriched the ex- 
amination of materials for clothing with new methods and results. 

1. Determination of the thickness of clothing materials. 

From eight to sixteen discs of the materials are laid upon each other, 
and the total thickness is measured under different pressures. There 
is manifested the great compressibility of knitted tissues and flannels 
as compared with linen and cotton. 

2. Determination of total thickness of human clothing. A needle is 
thrust through the clothing until its point just touches the skin, and a 
disc of cork is made to slide upon the needle until it touches the outer 
surface of the clothing. We thus obtain the thickness of the clothing 



APPENDIX. 427 

sive of the interjacent layers of air. The latter are ascertained by 
subtracting the thickness of the several tissues from the thickness of 
the total clothing. 

4. From a determination of the surface weight of different tissues and 
their thickness, we find the specific gravity of the clothing materials. 

The specific gravity varies enormously with the proportion of air, for 
cotton from 0-147 to 0768, for wool from OO95 (yarn) to 0'358 (flannel). 

5. The specific gravity of clothing materials free from air is for silk, 
cotton, and wool almost exactly =1*3. Hence, and from the specific 
gravity of the clothing, we may calculate the volume of the pores. In 
1000 parts by bulk of woollen flannel it is not less than 923. 

This investigation contains new results concerning the behaviour of 
the tissues with water. 

431. Emmerich (Arch. f. Hygiene, xiv. 243) determines the moisture 
in mortar by drying large specimens in a vacuum exsiccator. The 
apparatus employed is unfortunately rather expensive. 

447. In a room strongly lighted with gas, A. V. Bibra found in a 
number of careful experiments 1 to 2 mgrm. IS^Os per litre. He dis- 
cusses the toxicological literature of N 2 0s at length, but without 
original experiments on animals (Arch. f. Hygiene, xv. 216). 

447. In an abstract Kirchner correctly points out that Weber's 
photometer gives us a measure for the magnitude of the illumination, 
whilst the spacial angle-metre measures its quality. 

451. According to Thomson the quantity of smoke in a chimney 
flue can be determined by the discoloration of a slip of white paper 
(kept cold) in a given time (Journal of Gas Lighting, 1892, 437). 

456. As a large work of reference on all questions on house build- 
ing, we must recommend Baukunde des Architecten. 1891. Berlin. 
Toche). 

489. Cheese attacks nickel vessels remarkably strongly, perhaps in 
consequence of the formation of valerianic acid (Hellig, Chem. Zeit. 
Rep., 1892, p. 212). 

490a. Aluminium. See Lunge and E. Schmid (Chem. Zeit. Rep., 
1892, p. 37), and Rupp (Chem. Zeit. Rep., 1892, p. 21) ; Ohlmiiller and 
Heise (Arbeit aus dem k. Gesundheitsamt, viii. 377). 

494. On the poisonous character of methylen blue, compare Gal- 
liard (Toxicite du bleu de Methylene, Revue Internat. des Fals., iv. 181), 
and Guttmann and Ehrlich (Ueber die Wirkung des Methylenblaus bei 
Malaria, Berlin Klin. Wochenschrift, 1891, No. 39). 

495. Bulewsky has concluded a very valuable study on the exami- 
nation of and the decision on caoutchouc articles (Arch. /. Hygiene, xv. 
part ii.). 



428 APPENDIX. 

All caoutchouc articles with which children come in contact are 
harmless if (1) they float in water ; (2) if they are elastic ; (3) if 
they are of a soft consistence. Black dolls, coloured in the mass, 
contain lead oxide, and are poisonous (they sink in water). Red and 
reddish brown dolls, dyed in the mass, contain antimony sulphide 
(Sb 2 S 5 ), and are harmless. All grey articles of caoutchouc at which 
children often suck (e.g., grey teats) are relatively pernicious, as they 
contain zinc oxide. Caoutchouc articles are often superficially stained 
with poisonous colours. 

$ 501. On the advantages of the use of hot solutions of chemical 
disinfectants, see Adolf Heider (Arch.f. Hyyicne, xv. part iv.). 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE TABLES 

(INTERPOLATION). 

The following tables are of two kinds. The one group (I., II., VII. 
IX., X.) require no further explanation ; their indications are at once 
intelligible, as they contain simple constants. 

The tables III., IV., V., VI., &c., on the contrary, give laws according 
to which the magnitudes are mutually dependent, e.g., the proportion 
of fat and the specific gravity. It is plain that the table can merely 
regard individual cases, and does not give direct answers to the questions 
with which we are engaged. In such cases the value required is found 
by simple calculation (interpolation), as will be shown in two examples. 

1. How great is the highest possible atmospheric moisture, and the 
corresponding vapour tension at 24*7 ? 



Max. Tension. 

According to Table VI. at 24 = 22*2 mm. 21*5 grm. 

25 = 23'6 mm. 22'9 grm. 



Difference for 1 = 1*4 mm. or 1.4 grm. 

If the temperature in the interval between 24 and 25 rises by 01, 
the tension rises by 014 mm. and the highest possible moisture by 0*14 
grm. Hence for 24*7 the maximum tension is 22'2 + 7 x 0*14 = 
23*18 mm., and the maximum moisture = 21*5 + 7 x 0*14 = 22'48 grm. 

2. (a.) A sample of unskimmed milk had at 10 the specific gravity 
1*0243, or marked 24'3, what will it mark at the conventional normal 
temperature 15 ? 

In Table XI. we look down the column headed 10, and find the 
number 24*3. If we proceed horizontally in this line to the column 
15, we find there the number 25, and know that at 15 the milk would 
mark 25. 

(b.) If the milk at 10 Centigrade marked only 24*6, we cannot find 
this number in column 10, and have to interpolate. The two nearest 
values in the column 10 are 24*3 and 25*3. 

Milk weighing 24*3 would be (according to column 15) 25. 
j) 25*3 ., 26. 

For every tenth which the weight of the milk increases in the interval 
from 24*3 to 25*3, it weighs one-tenth heavier at 15. Hence at 15 
the sample would have the specific gravity : 24'6 + 7 x 0*1 =25*3. 

(c.) Double interpolation is required in the following example : 

Skimmed milk at 25*3 Cent, weighs 33*5, what will it weigh at 15 ? 

429 



430 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE TABLES. 

According to Table XI. a. : 

If at 25 it weighed 33, at 15 it would be 31. 
25 34-1, 15 32. 

Therefore for O'l which the milk increases in weight at 25, it is 0'09 
heavier at 15. 

If at 26 it weighed 33% at 15 it would be 31. 
26 34-3, 15 32. 

Therefore for each O'l which tlie milk weighs heavier at 26, at 15 
it weighs O09 heavier. Consequently if at 25 it weighed 33*5, at 15 
the weight would be 31 + 5 x 0-09 = 31 '45 ; if it weighs 33*5 at 26, the 
weight at 15 will be 31 + 3 x 0'09 = 31'27. 

From these two values the exact value may be deduced as follows : 

Milk which at 25 weighs 33'5, has at 15 the specific gravity 31 '45. 
26 33-5, 15 31-27. 



Or for a decrease of 1 = 0*22. 
Hence for 25'3 31 '45 - 3 x 0-002 = 31-45-0'066 = 31'384. 



This last calculation to three decimal places has no practical value, as 
the accuracy of the entire table does not extend beyond the first decimal 
place.

1 Instead of the complete figures for the specific gravity, only the 2nd, 3rd, 
and 4th decimal places are here given, corresponding to the scale on the hydro- 
meter ; thus, e.g., the number 43'0 represents the specific gravity 07430.
