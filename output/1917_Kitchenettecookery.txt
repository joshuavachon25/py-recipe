FOREWORD 

As the artist presents his finished picture, 
mounted or framed so that his friends may 
drink in its beauty without the odor of 
paints or brushes, so I offer this Uttle book 
to you, friends of the business world, who 
must needs eat and mayhap, too, love to 
cook what you eat rather than sit forever 
around a boarding-house table. 

I do not offer you my paints and brushes, 
that is, calories and proteins; nor even a 
dissertation on the chemistry of cooking 
or the physiology of digestion — for there 
are many books on those lines better than 
I could possibly write. I will refer you to 
them should this volume send you delving 
deeper for yourself into this fascinating 
play. I simply pass on to you the practical

application of these underlying principles 
which I have made in my own kitchenette 
apartment, the Scribbler's Den. 

Come with me into my playhouse and 
as my guest "bide a wee."

KITCHENETTE COOKERY 

CHAPTER I 

FITTING SHELVES TO SPACE AND 
SERVICE 

A KITCHENETTE is, as its name implies, a 
wee kitchen, and so tiny are the kitchenettes 
in the newest apartment houses that they 
make you think of children's playhouses. I 
dubbed my first one a playhouse, for many 
a luscious bite came forth after a bit of play. 

To one whose whole life, in so far as it has 
touched the kitchen, has known nought but 
the big old kitchen of her mother, a readjust- 
ment of both thought and body is necessary 
before a kitchenette becomes truly a play- 

1 



Kitchenette Cookery 

house. My first real kitchenette — in col- 
lege days I cooked in one made over from 
a clothes closet — was less than seven 
feet long and less than three feet wide 
with an adjoining supply closet. My pres- 
ent play kitchen measures seven and a 
half feet by two and a quarter feet, with 
no supply closet — just dreadful high 
shelves, of which the topmost one can only 
be reached from a stepladder — or a box on 
a chair and the cook on top with arms out- 
stretched, while the sink is so low that she 
must make a crook of her back to wash 
the dishes. Apartment house builders and 
plumbers must all be bachelors or widowers, 
for, if they had wives, they too would realize 
the objection to reaching from sky to river 
bottom every time a meal was cooked. 

By dint of keeping at it, I finally per- 
suaded my landlord to have the carpenter 
put up one shelf, and after waiting vainly 
for the fulfillment of promises of more, 

2 



Pitting Shelves to Space and Service 

purchased my own shelves and screws 
and, by means of a dollar bill, induced the 
janitor to put up two more shelves. These 
gave ample room for the necessary pots 
and pans and the foods to be cooked in 
them. 

On the topmost shelf are kept the cake 
tins, jelly molds, the ice-cream freezer, 
and other utensils which are not used 
every day. The next shelf is my grocery 
store and by stocking it well in the begin- 
ning and watching that the supplies do not 
get too low a complete dinner is always 
possible without calling on the butcher, 
baker, or grocer, or even stopping at the 
delicatessen shop. All dry groceries, as 
beans, split peas, cereals, sugar, etc., are 
poured out at once from the bags or boxes 
in which they arrive from the grocery 
store and placed in glass jars. Then no 
one is forgotten and reordered, or allowed 
to nm out, as it is always easy to see when 

3 



Kitchenette Cookery 

the supply is getting low. The lower 
shelf — although it is travesty to call it 
low — carries the casseroles, glass jars, 
and other food containers. 

NOT STEPS BUT A REACH 

Because we have tiny kitchens instead of 
the old rambling ones in which our mothers 
or their hired girls traveled so .many miles 
in preparing the meals, it does not mean that 
we cannot have the good things to eat, or 
that our womanly hands must needs lose 
their traditional cunning in cookery. Far 
from it — in fact it enriches our inherited 
cunning, for it makes us take a new tack, 
since our difficulty now lies not in having 
to walk so far from pantry to stove but in 
so arranging our cooking tools that each 
one is conveniently within reach, for there 
is no room to run about. 

Each pot and pan, knife and spoon, 
must have its place and learn to keep it. 

4 



Pitting Shelves to Space and Service 

Each utensil for which a place is allowed 
must have its definite purpose in order to 
keep its place for there is no room for use- 
less or merely ornamental kitchen devices 
in so small a kitchen. 

On the back of one of the big doors 
which conceal the kitchenette when closed 
is my kitchen cabinet. To use it the door 
must be opened and by means of a foot 
clamp firmly fastened to the floor so that 
it will not swing. The hanging work 
table lifts up and by means of an adjust- 
able bracket and support becomes a solid 
working surface. Sugar and flour con- 
tainers are so fastened to the heavy outer 
edges of the door that they swing in to 
let the sugar or flour fall into the pans 
standing on the table below. 

A curtain rod fastened to the door six 
inches above the table holds the knives, 
spatula, and cooking spoons. A ready-to- 
hang shelf above carries the glass containers 

5 



Kitchenette Cookery 

holding bread crumbs, cereal, corn meal, 
brown sugar, powdered sugar, elbow maca- 
roni, coffee, and tea. The spice containers 
hold the nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, 
mustard, pepper, and paprika, as well as 
cream of tartar, baking powder, and salt. 
Hanging from hooks just below the shelf 
are the vegetable chopper and cutters, 
can opener, Dover egg beater, kitchen 
scissors, and measuring spoons. 

On an enameled rack fastened to the end 
wall and fitted out with hooks for carrying 
pots and pans hang most of the cooking 
tools. I call this my Kitchen Carryall. 
On the first row of hooks hang the measuring 
cups, one glass and one aluminum — glass 
to measure sugar and flour and show the 
half and quarter cupfuls so frequently 
used in kitchenette cookery, and metal to 
measure scalding water or milk for sponge 
cakes. Two cups make cake mixing much 
quicker under any circumstances. 

6 



Fitting Shelves to Space and Service 

The "crab" hangs on the top row, too. 
It is a metal lifter which closes like a 
crab's claw on the hot pan or food which 
needs to be lifted or turned. Beside the 
crab hang the candy thermometer, skimmer, 
and egg whip. The food chopper hangs 
just below, where it can be readily lifted 
off and screwed on to the table edge. 
It is quite a worker in this kitchen. 

On a ready-to-hang shelf, which is se- 
curely fastened to the back wall by means 
of two large screws, reside my dishes, a 
cottage set of forty-three porcelain pieces. 
There is no unused space on this shelf 
either. Each dish has its place and must 
take it. Several brass-headed tacks placed 
near the back of the shelf form a plate 
rail to hold the platter and vegetable 
dish in place, while six screws under the 
shelf hold the six cups. 

The roll of paper toweling hanging just 
below does away with the old-fashioned 

7 



Kitchenette Cookery 

and unsightly kitchen cloths. At a cost 
from one fifth to one third of a cent apiece 
for absorbent paper squares it is not un- 
duly expensive to use them in place of 
cloths which must be frequently laundered, 
especially if you must needs pay for every 
bit of laundering done. Here paper towels 
have found many uses, such as wiping 
tables, as oven cloths, drying lettuce, 
wiping off greasy plates, and for draining 
greasy water. 

A KITCHENETTE STOVE 

We hunted for some time to find the 
proper stove for this playhouse, for just as 
the sinks would give our backs unneces- 
sary bending, so would most of the small 
stoves, in which the ovens are set below 
the cooking surface of the stove. Our 
present stove fills the bill nicely in having 
a high oven for baking as well as a broiler — 
frying has no legitimate place in a kitchen- 

8 




THE POTS AND PANS EACH HAVE THEIR HOOKS. 



Fitting Shelves to Space and Service 

ette apartment — but it is unnecessarily- 
large, fitting in without an inch to spare. 
Two burners instead of four, with the sim- 
merer and the oven four to six inches shal- 
lower, would serve the needs of a kitchenette 
cook just as well and leave the extra space 
for other uses — you have to count the 
inches in so small a kitchen. Some day 
stove manufacturers will build kitchenette 
stoves which will exactly fit our needs 
as well as our space, but not imtil they are 
convinced that we women really don't 
want to break our backs any longer. The 
shelf under this stove comes in very handy 
to carry the bread box, scales, and pres- 
sure cooker. 

i The small ice box, which ordinarily needs 
refilling but every other day, stands on a 
cement base set into the floor from which 
a pipe drains off the drip of the melting 
ice. Contrary to rule, the milk bottle 
takes its place beside the ice as does the 

9 



Kitchenette Cookery 

lettuce washed and placed in a cheesecloth 
bag. The floor of the ice-box holds the 
butter, cheese, eggs, and cream; the first 
shelf contains the half-a-can portions in 
glass jars and any cooked foods, while 
the top shelf is reserved for the fresh 
fruits. It is surprising how much food the 
little box will hold. 

KITCHENETTE DISH WASHING 

Stretched from one faucet in the sink 
to the other is a little wire rack which holds 
the soap, cork knife polisher, and the dish 
mop, a tinseled one. The flat suction sink 
stopper and rubber dish scraper hang above 
the sink. Sievelike cups cover the faucet 
ends to prevent the water from splashing. 

No dishpans hang on these walls — and 
why should they? — for the always abundant 
hot water of the modem apartment makes 
both teakettles and dishpans merely hang- 
ers-on of other days, when all the water had 

10 



Fitting Shelves to Space and Service 

to be heated and sparingly used. A paper 
towel or paper napkin wipes off the plates 
which under the fall of hot water from the 
hot-water faucet are automatically washed, 
or at most need but a switch or two with 
a dish mop to take their places in the 
wire dish drainer. The rack is then lifted 
into the sink for a moment, and the scald- 
ing water poured over the dishes, which 
are soon as dry and shiny as any you would 
wish to see. Only the glasses and silver 
need to be wiped with a tea towel, which 
is quickly washed right in the kitchen 
sink on a little aluminum washboard that 
you slip over the left hand, one of the 
newest devices found in the house-furnish- 
ing stores. Modem kitchenette dish wash- 
ing has several strong points of which to 
boast : 

No greasy dishwater — for it all runs 
down the sink as used. 

No smelly dishcloth or dish towels, for 
11 



Kitchenette Cookery 

it takes but one tea towel for glasses and 
silver. 

No horrid pots and pans, for you can 
not so dub lightweight utensils. 

No manicured hands ruined by dish 
washing, for your hands scarcely touch 
the water.

CHAPTER II 
THE POTS, PANS, AND CONTAINERS 

We business women go at our house- 
keeping quite differently from other women, 
partly because of the system business life 
has instilled into us and partly from ne- 
cessity. We know that our housekeeping 
is going to receive a minimum of time and 
attention, so that we must arrange to 
eliminate as many of its details as possible 
and let the rest almost automatically 
take care of themselves. This requires 
tools to fit the task and those that will 
do the work with the least trouble. 

One of my hardest workers is an alu- 
minum four-piece set which does duty as 
a roaster, large kettle, steamer, colander, 

13 



Kitchenette Cookery 

and vegetable cooker. This, with a small 
aluminum double boiler, is a treasure since 
I have found it possible to procure the steel 
wool and soap combination cleaner, now put 
up by several firms, to keep aluminum in 
good condition. Steel wool — aptly called 
the "shearings of a hydraulic ram" — 
applied with just a little "elbow grease" 
every few weeks keeps the aluminum uten- 
sils bright and shiny. It is the alkali of 
hard water which discolors them by at- 
tacking the surface of the aluminum, so 
by avoiding the use of extra alkali or soda 
in washing I avoid unnecessary work. 

The hardest worker of all is a small 
double boiler; the upper part is used in 
preparing half-a-can recipes or in cooking 
about a pint of food material either directly 
over the flame or in simmering it over the 
lower water-filled boiler. The lower boiler 
is used in the cooking of larger amoimts 
of food directly over the flame. This 

14 



The Pots, Pans, and Containers 

utensil serves not only in its capacity as 
a double boiler but as a teakettle for boil- 
ing water for tea or coffee. 

The aluminum pans cost more than 
some others — the four-piece set costing 
over three dollars and the double boiler 
eighty-five cents — but a business woman 
counts so much of her time as money 
that her home hours become precious. 
So for her, if not for all, it is economy 
in the long run to buy utensils that both 
do good work and require the least time 
and care later. 

A PRESSURE COOKER AS A TIME SAVER 

The waffle iron has its regular Sunday 
breakfast to prepare, while my best play- 
fellow, a steam pressure cooker, does double 
duty. It plays its part as a steam canner 
when a basket of peaches or com has been 
sent in from the country by friends, as well 
as to cook combination meals in double- 

15 



Kitchenette Cookery 

quick time. It is a large cast aluminum 
kettle with its cover fastened down to re- 
tain the steam by means of copper bolts 
which develop muscle and sometimes 
temper in the unscrewing when the table 
and guests are waiting — but then what 
good friend has not his drawbacks. 

The pressure cooker's greatest asset to 
the kitchenette dinner party, besides cut- 
ting the cooking time in two or three, is 
that the odors of the cooking are all re- 
tained in the kettle and released to the 
great out-of-doors instead of in the room 
itself — by setting the cooker on the sill 
of an opened window before turning the 
exhaust valve to release the pressure prior 
to removing the cover. A ball-and-spring 
safety valve eliminates all possible troubles 
from too high pressure, for when thirty 
pounds of steam pressure is reached, 
as shown on the dial, a whistle blows 
which not only lets off the extra steam 
16 



The Pots, Pans, and Containers 

but gives warning to the cook lady to turn 
down her gas flame. 

GLASS JARS FOR DRY GROCERIES 

Glass jars with wide mouths and rubber 
rings around the top to exclude air and 
break the click of glass in closing come in 
various sizes. Pint and quart sizes at 
fifteen and twenty cents apiece best fit 
the need of a kitchenette. This is a pur- 
chase to be made but once, and once 
these jars are used you will never part 
with them, or be out of the food material 
needed through having forgotten that "the 
powdered sugar was all used up last time. " 

The little two-cup percolator, which in 
the first few weeks of its stay was as good 
as an alarm clock piping out " Get up and 
see your percolator perk", has had a tragic 
career. It had a dreadful accident. Some- 
body set it on the stove with coffee in the 
top but no water below, and it lost both 

17 



Kitchenette Cookery 

its spout and handle, was badly burned, 
and had to spend four weeks in its manu- 
facturer's hospital for injured goods. How- 
ever, you would never know it now as it 
sings its cheery morning song. 

THE UTENSILS AT WORK AND PLAY 

In order to prove the advantage of hav- 
ing utensils and food containers, work 
table and stove so close together, let us 
make a Baker sunshine cake. Bringing 
down the small-tube cake tin, size Num- 
ber 5, from the top shelf, we can stand 
in front of the work table, reach down 
into the ice box for our two eggs, reach 
to the right without a step for the flour 
sieve, egg whip, measuring cups, flour pan, 
and the long-handled saucepan with a 
rounded bottom which does duty as a 
mixing bowl. 

Baking powder from the shelf above is 
measured with the measuring spoon which 

18 



The Pots, Pans, and Containers 

hangs in front of us and is added to the 
sifted and measured flour, sifted again 
once or twice, and set aside while the 
sugar is measured and lifted once. The 
eggs are separated, and the yolks dropped 
into a third of a cupful of cold water 
which has been placed in the mixing bowl. 
The whites of the eggs are beaten up 
with the egg whip until the platter can 
be inverted without the mass moving. 
The yolks and the water are beaten up 
with the Dover egg beater for five or six 
minutes until light and foamy. The sugar, 
then the sifted flour and baking powder, are 
added gradually, continuing the beating 
with the beater. The flavoring is added 
now, and the whites of the eggs carefully 
folded, not stirred or beaten, into the 
mixture. It is a very foamy mass as it 
is poured into the pan, half filling it, as a 
sunshine or sponge cake should rise as 
high again while in the oven. We may 

19 



Kitchenette Cookery 

put this mto a cold oven — that is, light 
the oven gas just as we put the cake 
into the oven and let it gradually get 
hot. A cake without shortening needs 
to rise and bake slowly so as not to be 
tough. 

We must look at our cake frequently to 
see that the heat is right for the cake to 
rise but not to brown during the first 
fifteen minutes. It should take from forty 
to forty-five minutes for the entire baking. 
If the oven gets too hot turn down the 
flame or turn out one of the burners. It 
is done and ready to come out when the 
edge begins to shrink away from the side of 
the pan, and it stops its funny little sizzling 
sound of baking. It should come out of the 
oven at once and be turned upside down 
to "hang" for a time before it is removed 
from the pan on to a wire rack to air, 
cool, and to be frosted. 

In three minutes we can have all the 
20 



The Pots, Pans, and Containers 

soiled dishes washed up, for as we have 
finished with egg beater, cup, or pan we 
have set it under the cold-water faucet 
to soak in cold water. 

It has taken just twenty minutes to 
put the cake into the oven and five more 
to leave the same order we found. Cake 
making as simple as this becomes a pleasant 
diversion with the added zest of serving 
real homemade cake to friends who drop 
in later. 

Simplified kitchens give greater satis- 
faction in return for the time spent in their 
planning than almost anything else, since 
to most women cooking is either a distinct 
pleasure or a dreadful cross.

CHAPTER III 
THE FIRST BILL OF GROCERIES 

The first bill of groceries is not such an 
enormous one, after all, for our kitchenette 
supply space is almost microscopic as com- 
pared with our mother's pantry and cellar 
supply shelves, and so must be filled 
accordingly. 

The staple groceries which we could at 
once turn out of their bags and boxes 
into our glass jars, or keep in their own 
containers, would include the following : 

Floiir, 5 pounds Powdered Sugar,

MARKETING FOR TWO 

The ability to market or purchase food 
supplies is not a matter of inheritance 
or of theoretical knowledge any more than 
the fact that four times four equals sixteen 
is inherited or is a matter of theoretical 
knowledge. Somewhere in the course of 
our school days we found that four fours 
gave us sixteen, over and over again, and 

25 



Kitchenette Cookery 

the theoretical fact became a practical one 
that we could use. So it is with market- 
ing, whether for one or two or more. Of 
course I knew theoretically how to buy 
cabbage, etc., how to pick out a solid 
head, and what it cost at the time and in 
the place where I was studying marketing. 

But unlike the axiom that four times 
four equals sixteen, which is unchanged 
whether in China or in Philadelphia, and 
the same fifty years ago as to-day, food 
prices differ not only in different parts of 
the country but often just across the 
street, or even at another counter of the 
same market ; they not only have changed 
in the last fifty years but have literally 
galloped within the last year — sometimes 
they leaped just overnight. 

I have taken to marketing as I have 

taken to other games — and there is 

certainly enough of a gamble in marketing 

for foods these days, for no matter how 

26 



The First Bill of Groceries 

well I play my hand, sometimes I win, 
sometimes I lose; but I am finding it as 
fascinating a game as ever I played. 

From my store of theoretical knowledge 
I brought out and turned into everyday 
use these divisions of all foods, which aid 
in the planning of my menus and in the 
marketing to fit or adjust them.

WHERE KNOWLEDGE OF POOD VALUES HELPS 

There are just five of these groups, but 
every food is so chemically constructed 
that it more naturally falls into one group 
than another, so I have to carry but five 
groups in mind in order to plan my meals, 

28 



The First Bill of Groceries 

I aim to plan them so that I have a food 
out of each of the five groups at least 
twice each day — that is, I may have 
meat only for dinner, but I will use milk 
or cheese in my lunch dish so that gives 
fiesh foods twice. 

This flesh or protein group includes the 
foods that cost the most money, so if we 
are playing the marketing game to reduce 
expenses, it pays to find out the cost of 
various kinds of meat, fish, and cheese, 
and to serve flesh foods just twice instead 
of several times a day. 

The least expensive group is the next 
one, the starches — and although we have 
most of us inherited the notion, not fact, 
that we must have potatoes with meat, 
we can find by a study of their make-up 
that rice, macaroni, and bread all have 
the starch which potatoes supply, and so 
we can turn up other cards and win the 
game by knowing which ones to play. 

29 



Kitchenette Cookery 

As Americans we are apt to overeat 
rather than undereat, so that for one who 
knows the game and how to be diplo- 
matic with her partner's tastes and fancies, 
it is not impossible to win the prize. 

CHOOSING QUANTITIES 

Another phase of the kitchenette market- 
ing is getting the right amount — not too 
much or too little — of the food desired. 
Where there are pantry and cellar supply 
shelves, it pays to buy foods in quantities, 
but not so for our kitchenette apartment. 
All fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as 
meats, must find a place in the refrigerator, 
and as the walls of the refrigerator are 
not elastic, the garbage pail is too apt 
to get more than its share of food that is 
wasted because of the lack of a cool place 
to keep it. 

A glance at a two weeks' market order, 
after some of these experiences had taught 
30

wisdom in small-quantity buying, tells how 
it can be done.

THE QUANTITY TO ORDER 

In buying ribbon we instinctively ask the 
price per yard and then order a yard or 
two, or if less than a yard, we call for 
a half, a quarter, or an eighth of a yard 
— never ten cents' worth. We should 
so order our food — by the pound, half 
pound, quarter pound, or other definite 
measure. Just because it is easier or a 
matter of habit to follow the line of least 
resistance, we too often say "ten cents' 
worth, please", when it comes to buying 
food, and, by. not being exact ourselves, 
encourage our grocer to become careless 
too. 

The profits on retail groceries are not 
large, so that our very carelessness necessi- 
tates the grocer adding to his overhead 
expense the cost of expensive scales on 
which he can weigh accurately the "ten 
cents' worth" of food which retails at 
twenty-five or thirty-five cents a pound 
32 



The First Bill of Groceries 

— which charge we must pay in the in- 
creased cost of our groceries. The alter- 
native open to the grocer who has not 
invested in these expensive scales is to guess 
at the quantity, and guessing sometimes 
is overweight, sometimes underweight — 
his loss or ours. 

Another necessary point is to see that 
we get the quantity we order, for a second 
result of this same carelessness on the part 
of the buyer is the condition existing in 
many stores : when you ask for three pounds 
of rib roast at twenty-two cents a pound, 
they cut it off and, on weighing, invariably 
find that they have made a mistake and 
cut too much. "Seventy-five cents' worth ; 
that's all right, isn't it?" This with a 
manner that makes us feel very small not 
to say "Oh, certainly" and pay the bill. 

It does take courage to refuse it, but it 
doesn't take more than a few refusals to 
convince the butcher that we know how 

33 



Kitchenette Cookery 

much meat we want. He wants our trade, 
and competition is keen, so that he will 
serve us as we wish, when we let him 
know that we ourselves know what we 
want. The grocer, too, will go to the 
trouble to look up specific brands of goods 
for us when he finds that we really don't 
want substitutes. 

The brands of canned and package 
foods are becoming so numerous that 
there is a great field for interesting ex- 
ploration among them as well as in the 
market among the fresh fruits, vegetables, 
and meats. The business woman is at a 
great disadvantage when it comes to the 
choosing of these latter, for she must needs 
turn the picking out of her order over to 
her grocer or market man because her 
daily work seldom gives her the time to 
go to market. But she can train her 
grocer to send her good products by re- 
turning poor goods just a few times. 
34 



The First Bill of Groceries 

If we give the grocer a fair deal, he'll 
give us one — but let us not give him a 
chance to act on the basis that we don't 
know what we want.

CHAPTER IV 

COUNTING COSTS 

When I started out to fit up this 
kitchenette I had a very vague idea as to 
how much it would cost, for the paper 
houses I had furnished in school days had 
long ago gone with the notebooks contain- 
ing them, the way college notebooks go. 
I was not seeking to spend a certain 
amount of money for furnishings, or to 
get along on the fewest and cheapest of 
kitchen tools — but to purchase the tools 
best fitted for the tasks as I found them. 

In looking for china, I found a cottage 

set that included all the necessary pieces 

for kitchenette dining service, and, although 

they were American porcelain, not so at- 

36

Counting Costs 

tractive as the more expensive china, a set 
with a tiny band of gold and two pink 
roses on each dish fitted in harmoniously 
with the color scheme of the dining and 
living room of my two-room suite. In 
looking for silver I searched for simple 
lines, and as that day the pocketbook had 
cautioned "Go easy", I found among in- 
expensive, silver-plated ware a set of 
dessert knives, forks, spoons, and tea- 
spoons which met these demands as well 
as the size of the small gate-legged oak 
table. 

I saved all bills and purchase slips to 
check up some day. The following list 
includes utensils which I purchased in the 
house-furnishing departments of several 
large department stores, house-furnishing 
stores, and ten-cent stores. It may be of 
use as a guide for another who, too, starts 
with a hazy idea of the cost of kitchenette 
utensils. Prices, of course, are continually

varying, due to qualities of material and 
conditions of the general market.

CHAPTER V 

BREAKFAST ON A TIME LIMIT 

Neakly every one has a time limit for 
breakfast — either in the preparing or eat- 
ing of it. That is probably the reason 
that for most people breakfast becomes 
more or less of a static affair. You may 
like coffee and toast as the framework of 
the meal, and some one else may wish fruit 
and eggs, varying the drink from coffee to 
cocoa or milk. If we must catch a certain 
car, we know about how long it takes 
to put down our static breakfast, and if 
we must needs prepare it also, we have 
found out how long that takes. When a 
change in the routine is made, we must 
42 



Breakfast on a Time Limit 

allow extra time or take the chance of 
missing that car. 

As a light breakfast suits the mistress 
of this kitchenette, the routine is to 
turn on the hot-water faucet (in a house 
where forty-eight apartments are supplied 
with hot water from a boiler, I count 
the water fresh enough to use for cooking), 
measure two level tablespoonfuls of coffee 
into the top of the percolator, and pour 
over it a cup of water, now quite hot 
from the faucet, and set the coffeepot on 
the simmerer. In three minutes it begins 
to bubble up and sing its cheery song. I 
light the burners of the oven for toast, cut 
two slices of bread, prepare grapefruit, 
orange, or bananas, and set my breakfast 
table. Getting the pint bottle of milk 
from the dumb waiter, I wipe off the 
mouth of the bottle and dip out the cream 
for coffee. When the gas oven has been 
lighted for five minutes, the slices of bread 

43 



Kitchenette Cookery 

are placed on the broiler, set up close to 
the flame. Three minutes of close watch- 
ing are necessary now to ensure slices of 
golden brown toast without even a 
blackened streak near the edges. This is 
buttered, and the coffee poured, and all 
soon disappear in order that a certain car 
may be caught. 

For the bride whose time limit is set by 
another's car and appetite, I have in- 
cluded a variety of breakfasts which may 
be built up from the static breakfast of 
fruit or cereal, eggs or meat, toast or hot 
bread, and breakfast drink.

CHAPTER VI 
LUNCHEONS AT HOME AND BY BOX 

Luncheons at home, seldom possible 
for the business woman, but usually for 
the bride — kitchenette apartments seem 
invariably to be occupied by one or the 
other — are nearly always eaten alone. 
But even so they can be attractive and 
appetizing, although we naturally demand 
menus that are quickly and easily prepared. 

Some luncheon tastes run to salads, some 
to cream soups, and some to "creamed on 
toast" dishes, but a varied and pleasing 
list of limcheon menus can be made up by 
using one of these three groups for the 
main dish in each menu. In fact a 
luncheon dish with bread and butter, a 
cup of tea or cocoa (rarely coffee), and bit 
of sweet either in fruit or cake is getting 

51 



Kitchenette Cookery 

to be the popular luncheon to-day. We 
are learning that when we are not sawing 
wood we don't need to eat hearty foods, 
and in fact are much more comfortable 
for not eating sawing-wood meals. 

Plain Tea 
1 teaspoonful tea 1 cupful boiling water 

Rinse out a china or earthenware tea- 
pot with boiUng water and put into it a 
level teaspoonful of tea. Pour in a meas- 
uring cupful of boiling water and let it 
stand in a warm place, but not over the 
flame, for three minutes and serve at once. 
Serve with sugar, cream, or lemon to suit 
the individual taste. After measuring the 
water with a measuring cup once or twice 
it is easy to determine how far such a cup 
fills your teapot, and you can then dis- 
pense with measuring the water, pouring 
the boiling water directly on to the tea. 
One such cupful gives two teacups of tea. 

52 




AFTERNOON TEA ON THE TEA-WAGON. 



Luncheons at Home and by Box 

Boiled Coffee 
2 tablespoonf uls coffee 1 cupful boiling water 

Measure two level tablespoonfuls or one 
rounded one that is just equal to the two 
level, into a coffeepot which has been 
freshly rinsed out with boiling water. Add 
one measuring cupful of rapidly boiling 
water and let it boil for three minutes. 
After the three minutes of boiling, add a 
tablespoonful of cold water and let it 
stand a few minutes before serving. By 
tucking a piece of tissue paper into the 
spout to withhold the aroma while the 
coffee is boiling, a better-flavored coffee 
results. 

Cocoa 
2 tablespoonfuls cocoa 1 cupful boiling water 
2 tablespoonfuls sugar 1 cupful milk 
1 teaspoonful com- A few grains of cinna- 

starch mon 

Mix the sugar and cocoa, level table- 
spoonfuls of each, with the cornstarch, in a 

53 



Kitchenette Cookery 

saucepan, add the cinnamon, and pour on 
the boiling water. Let boil up for three 
minutes. Add the milk slowly, bring to 
the boiling point, and whip for a minute 
with the Dover egg beater. Serve with a 
teaspoonful of whipped cream to each cup. 
This recipe gives two cupfuls of cocoa. 

CREAM SOUPS 

For a simple and satisfying luncheon for 
one person, nothing is better or easier to 
prepare than a cream soup, with crackers, 
or bread and butter, and a bit of a sweet 
to finish off the meal. Any one of the fol- 
lowing cream soups is sufficient for a 
limcheon for one; the recipes can be 
doubled or tripled to serve more people: 

Cream of Peanut Butter Soup 

I tablespoonf ul butter 1 tablespoonful peanut 
^ tablespoonful flour butter 

I teaspoonful salt 1 cupful milk 

I teaspoonful paprika 

54 



Luncheons at Home and by Box 

In the top pan of the double boiler, 
placed directly over the flame, melt the 
butter and add the flour and salt. Set 
aside from the flame and add the cupful 
of milk slowly, stirring until evenly mixed. 
Return to the flre and let cook up for two 
miiiutes. Fill the lower part of the double 
boiler with hot water and place the soup 
pan above it. Mix the peanut butter with 
a little cold milk and add to the soup, and 
stir until smooth. Just before serving, 
give it a turn with the Dover egg beater, 
so as to serve a very creamy soup. 

Cream of Tomato Soup for Two 

1 tablespoonf ul butter 1 cupful strained tomato 
1 tablespoonf ul flour 1 cupful milk 

1 teaspoonful salt i teaspoonful paprika 

J teaspoonful soda 

Melt the butter, add the flour, remove 
from the flre, and add the milk, stirring 
until smooth, and return to the flre to 
cook up for two minutes. Heat the 

55 



Kitchenette Cookery 

strained tomato to boiling and add the 
soda, skimming off the foam which forms. 
Pour the heated tomato into the hot milk 
and turn off the flame under the milk at 
once. Add the salt and paprika, whip 
for a minute with the Dover egg beater, 
and serve. 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 
Creamed Asparagus on Toast 
1 cupful milk i teaspoonful salt 

1 tablespoonful butter 1 tablespoonful flour 
Cooked asparagus 

Melt the butter, stir in the flour and salt, 
remove from the fire, and stir in the milk. 
If this is added slowly and let boil up for 
a few minutes, a white sauce without 
lumps is the result. Heat the asparagus 
by steaming it in a wire sieve placed over 
a saucepan of hot water while making the 
sauce. Place the heated asparagus on 
slices of hot buttered toast and pour over 
it the hot white sauce. 

56 



Luncheons at Home and by Box 

Nearly all cooked vegetables are deli- 
cious when heated up in this cream sauce 
and make an appetizing luncheon dish of 
left-over bits. 

LUNCHEON SALADS 

Another good way of disguising bits of 
left-over foods is to combine them, mix 
with a salad dressing, and serve on a bed 
of lettuce. Vegetables can be combined 
with other vegetables, fruits, meat, or fish. 
A few nuts or chopped olives added to a 
mixture of fruits, or fruit and vegetables, 
change the character of the dish. 

There are several good salad dressings 
which can also be varied to provide the 
"something different" dish by adding a 
tablespoonful of tomato catsup, chopped 
peppers, or pickles. 

French Dressing 

I teaspoonful salt 1 tablespoonful lemon 

i teaspoonful paprika juice or vinegar 

I teaspoonful pepper 3 tablespoonfuls oil 

57 



Kitchenette Cookery 

Drop the dry ingredients into a glass- 
stoppered bottle, add the lemon juice, and 
give it a shake. Add the oil and shake 
vigorously for half a minute just before 
serving on the salad. 

Thousand Island Salad Dressing 
To two thirds of a cupful of mayonnaise 
dressing add two teaspoonfuls each of 
chopped green peppers, pimientos, and 
chives, the sifted yolk of one hard-cooked 
egg, half a teaspoonful of paprika, tomato 
catsup, tarragon vinegar, and three table- 
spoonfuls of chili sauce. 

Cooked Salad Dressing 

f cupful cream | teaspoonful mustard 

2 tablespoonfuls vine- J teaspoonful paprika 

gar i teaspoonful salt 

2 tablespoonfuls butter 2 egg yolks or 1 whole 

egg 

Mix the salt, paprika, and mustard and 
add the beaten egg, melted butter, and 
58 



Luncheons at Home and by Box 

cream. Cook in a double boiler, stirring 
gently until slightly thickened, add the 
vinegar slowly, stirring continually until 
well mixed. Remove from the fire and 
whip up with the Dover egg beater for 
just a moment before cooling. 

LUNCHES BY BOX 

Box lunches can be made appetizing by 
careful packing. Glass jars for salad or 
cream soup, to be heated up on an alcohol 
stove or electric plate, and waxed paper 
for wrapping individual sandwiches, cake, 
or cookies are essential. 

For the lunch to be taken on a hike, a 
thermos bottle in which to carry hot coffee 
or hot soup is almost indispensable. Where 
a cold drink is desired this same bottle can 
be used equally well. Following are recipes 
for various sandwiches which are especially 
suited for box lunches : 



59 



Kitchenette Cookery 

Egg Sandwiches 
Chop the whites of hard-cooked eggs and 
put the yolks through a strainer. Season 
with a boiled or mayonnaise salad dressing 
and spread between thin slices of buttered 
bread. 

Nut and Olive Sandwiches 
Chop equal quantities of English wal- 
nuts or pecans and olives, moisten with 
mayonnaise dressing, and spread between 
thin slices of buttered bread. 

Jam or Jelly Sandwiches 
Mix together a quarter of a cupful of finely 
chopped English walnuts or pecans with 
half a cupful of currant jelly or strawberry 
jam, season with lemon juice if too sweet, 
and spread between slices of buttered bread. 

Fig or Date Sandwiches 
Mix together half a cupful each of dates 
or figs and Enghsh walnuts, season with 
60 



Luncheons at Home and by Box 

lemon juice, and spread on slices of buttered 
bread. The dates should first be cooked 
in a little water before being chopped and 
mixed with the nuts. 

Sardine Sandwiches 

3 large sardines 1 tablespoonful olives, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter chopped 

I teaspoonful paprika 1 teaspoonful parsley, 

1| teaspoonful lemon chopped 
juice 

Cream the butter; skin and bone the 
sardines, mash, and add to the butter, 
with the lemon juice and paprika. Add 
the olive and chopped parsley, and spread 
between thin slices of white bread.

CHAPTER VII 
DINNERS FOR SELF AND FRIENDS 

We shall have to admit that the business 
woman is at a disadvantage when it comes 
to cooking dinners — for there is no gain- 
saying the fact that a dinner really worthy 
the name is hard to prepare when it is 
known to be intended for but one — so 
when the mood for real dinners is on, the 
business woman is apt to search for victims 
among her friends. 

A kitchenette dinner, even when the 
victim is secured, is a type all its own. 
There is the necessary informality of serv- 
ice, too, that adds to rather than detracts 
from the charm of a kitchenette dinner 
party. My guests have usually counted 
it great fun to arrive in time to watch a part 
of the play of preparation — and as the 
62

kitchenette opens right into the living and 
dining room, it is impossible for the cook 
lady to hide. 

As the dessert and salad — when the 
latter is to be served as a separate com-se 
— are prepared, they are placed on the 
tea wagon with the sugar bowl and cream 
pitcher. The tea wagon is then pulled 
to the left of the hostess's place so that 
she can change the courses without getting 
up from the table. 

A LUSCIOUS ROAST BEEF 

For this dinner I secured a three and 
three-quarter pound porterhouse roast — 
that is the first cut of rib roast — which 
that day was twenty-two cents a pound. It 
came rolled and tied, as I had asked the 
butcher to prepare it. Lighting the gas 
under the oven that it might have ten 
minutes or so in which to become very hot, 
I wiped off the meat with a piece of paper 

63 



Kitchenette Cookery 

toweling dipped in water, and placed the 
meat on a wire rack in my large aluminum 
pan (to be used as a roaster) with the skin 
side up. This was put in a hot oven and 
the meat turned once during the first fifteen 
minutes, then dredged with flour, salted with 
a teaspoonful of salt, peppered with a shake 
of the pepper shaker, and basted with the 
fat that had melted out. The flame was 
then turned down, as after the first searing 
in a hot oven, to make the meat retain all 
its juices, a roast or a steak should continue 
its cooking slowly. 

No water was added to the pan, as it 
changes the flavor, and we wanted a truly 
roast this time. Every ten or fifteen 
minutes the meat was basted and dredged 
with flour and in just an hour and a 
half was ready to serve — not roasted to 
death but cooked through. Sometimes, 
for the last half-hour's cooking, I invert 
the other aluminum pan over the meat, 
64 



Dinners for Self and Friends 

making a roaster, although when not too 
busy to baste the meat I prefer the flavor 
of a basted roast. 

As this was to be an oven dinner, the 
potatoes were sliced and allowed to stand 
in cold water while the biscuits were mixed 
and set into the ice box until the meat was 
ready to come out of the oven. The bis- 
cuits, cut with a very small cutter, were 
then placed in the oven where they would 
be baked by the time the other things were 
on the table. The dish of escalloped pota- 
toes was ready to go into the oven when the 
heat of the oven was turned down for the 
meat. This gave them time to be thor- 
oughly cooked.

A CHICKEN A LA KING DINNER 

As dinners are built around the meat 
dish, and for the informal service of a 
kitchenette apartment must necessarily 
consist of but two or at most three courses, 
the combination dishes of meat, fish, or 
fowl with vegetables, such as chicken a la 
king, casserole of veal, or creamed salmon 
in rice, are especially adapted to our pur- 
pose. For the dish of chicken a la king 
the thighs, legs, and part of the breast 
were steamed for ten minutes imder ten 
pounds of pressure in the pressure cooker 
and cut up into small pieces.

1 tablespoonful flour | cupful thin cream 

1 teaspoonful lemon or kumquat juice 

Skin the mushroom caps and cut the

one tablespoonful of butter until slightly 
browned. While these are cooking, in an- 
other saucepan melt a tablespoonful of 
butter and stir into it the flour, salt, and 
paprika. Add the chicken stock and cream, 
stirring constantly, and add the peppers and 
mushrooms. When it has boiled for three

minutes, add the lemon or kumquat juice 
and chicken. As it boils up again, stir in 
the well-beaten yolk of egg until evenly 
blended and serve on toast points at once. 
For the beet salad cut the beets into small 
balls and place them on a bed of shredded 
lettuce. To shred the lettuce, wash thor- 
oughly to remove grit, dry on a paper 
towel, and cut into strips with the kitchen 
scissors. Lettuce for salads is much crisper 
if it has lain in a piece of cheesecloth on ice 
for an hour or more before serving. Pour 
over this a French dressing.

CHAPTER VIII 

HIGH-PRESSURE DINNERS 

It was quarter past one when we came 
in and took off our wraps and we had to 
leave the house by quarter past two in 
order to secure our seats for a lecture. On 
a wild impulse I had asked three friends to 
come out and be good sports with me in 
getting a bite to eat. Veal stew and 
dumplings I had planned for myself, with 
just a pound of stewing veal in the refrigera- 
tor. New Bermuda potatoes were on hand, 
however, and we hastily washed and 
brushed these while the meat was turned 
into the hot pressure cooker to brown in a 
bit of vegetable oil and butter. The meat 
browned, the potatoes were turned in and

High-Pressure Dinners 

salted with the meat on the rack, two cups 
of hot water added, and the cover was 
clamped on. In five minutes the pressure 
gauge ran up to twenty pounds, where by 
turning down the gas flame, it was held for 
ten minutes. 

A can of tomatoes was opened, sugared, 
and put on to heat. Four level table- 
spoonfuls of coffee were put into the per- 
colator and two cups of hot water added 
and set over the simmerer of the gas 
range to percolate. The celery was washed 
and cut and the tiutter put on the butter 
dishes. The mushroom caps were washed 
and peeled and the bread cut. The ten 
minutes up, the pressure cooker was taken 
to the window sill and exhausted to the 
outer air. The meat and potatoes were 
removed, and three tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour and the mushroom caps were 
added to the stock in the kettle to make 
the brown gravy. 

73 



Kitchenette Cookery 

The salad had to be stretched as much as 
the meat, so each salad plate drew for its 
share two heart leaves of lettuce with some 
shredded outer leaves. Two tablespoon- 
fuls of grated carrot were placed on each 
serving of lettuce; a French dressing was 
quickly made in the glass-stoppered salad 
bottle and poured over the carrot and 
lettuce. 

In just forty minutes from the time we 
entered the door we sat down to the fol- 
lowing dinner:

BOSTON BAKED BEANS IN A KITCHENETTE? 

Did you ever stop to think that even 
Boston baked beans are really boiled, not 
74 



High-Pressure Dinners 

baked? For even in the Boston way the 
beans are first parboiled, put into the bean 
pot with hot water added, and so boiled 
instead of baked in the oven. 

Here is where my pet, the pressure 
cooker, best shows off his time-cutting 
qualities. For the parboiling process two 
cups of beans are washed and soaked in 
lukewarm water for an hour or two, then 
put into the cooker with a teaspoonful of 
soda and two cupfuls of boiling water to 
parboil. The cover is clamped on, and the 
pressure run up to twenty pounds, where 
it is held for five minutes by turning the 
gas lower. After this cooking, drain off 
the water, add more hot water to rinse, and 
again drain the beans. Now pour the beans 
into a bean pot and add a quarter of a 
pound of salt pork scalded and cut into 
small pieces. To half a cup of hot water 
add three tablespoonfuls of molasses, one 
eighth teaspoonful of ginger, one eighth 

75 



Kitchenette Cookery 

teaspoonful of mustard, and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Pour this over the beans, and 
if necessary add more water until you can 
see it. 

Place the bean pot inside of the cooker, 
on the wire rack, and add two cupfuls 
of hot water. Let the pressure run up 
to fifteen pounds. Turn down the flame 
so that the pressure remains steady at 
fifteen pounds for an hour and a half. 
When the beans are taken out of the pot, 
they have the rich, brown color and the 
identical flavor of real Boston baked beans 
— such at least was the verdict of two 
Bostonians who happened to be the victims 
of this experiment. 

To have baked beans for dinner and only 
start them soaking at three o'clock in the 
afternoon and use but one gas flame for 
less than two hours instead of eight hours 
of oven heat is certainly worth while. Is 
it any wonder that I am fond of my pet?

CHAPTER IX 
EXPERIMENTS TRIED ON FRIENDS 

A LITTLE bride next door came in to ask 
how long she should roast a four and a 
half pound chicken which "hubby had 
ordered home for a company dinner that 
night." She wanted that chicken just 
right, and I was looking for victims — 
both chickens to roast and folks to eat 
them, so I claimed this an opportunity 
not to be lightly passed by, and together 
we set to on Mister Chickie. 

We first singed off the remains of his 
feathered coat over the gas flame, holding 
neck and wings in one hand and legs in 
the other, for just a moment or two, being 
careful not to let the flame itself touch 
and char the bird. As the crop had been 
removed it was not necessary, as otherwise, 

80 



Experiments Tried on Friends 

to cut the slit in the skin at the back of 
the neck and pull out the gullet, crop, and 
windpipe. I am always glad when the 
butcher has completed his end of the 
job by removing all, instead of just part, 
of these internal structures, replacing the 
gizzard, liver, and heart in the cavity when 
he delivers the chicken. Our butcher, 
however, had failed to remove heart, lungs, 
and kidneys from the body of the fowl, 
so I had to insert my hand and with a 
slow pressing and pulling motion of my 
fingers along the backbone work under 
the soft structures and remove them all. 
The heart we placed with the gizzard and 
liver to be cooked for the giblet gravy, 
throwing away the rest. 

We cut off the neck bone, but not the 
skin, even with the wings, then held the 
bird under the cold-water faucet for just 
a moment and wiped it off, inside and out, 
with a soft paper towel. The stuffing, 

81 



Kitchenette Cookery 

wherein lay the experiment for me — my 
"trick on Mister Chickie" — consisted of 
the following : 

3 cupfuls soft bread crumbs 

J cupful peanut butter 

1 teaspoonful salt 

J teaspoonful paprika 

1 egg, lightly beaten 

J cupful liquid, stock or water 

This was all mixed together and stuffed 
into the chicken until it resumed its nor- 
mal shape. With the kitchenette darning 
needle and a bit of white twine, a few 
stitches were taken to close the cavity, 
so that the dressing would not cook out 
in the oven. We folded forward the neck 
skin, folded back the wings and tied them 
securely down with a cord, and inserted 
a few pieces of salt pork over the breast 
of the chicken, fastening them imder the 
neck skin with the darning needle itself. 
The legs were pulled back close to the body 
82 



Experiments Tried on Friends 

and tied securely by drawing another cord 
around the body of the bird. 

Mister Chickie, on a rack, not on the 
bottom of the roasting pan, then took his 
stand in the center of a hot oven for fifteen 
minutes. During this time he was turned 
so as to become evenly browned on all sides. 
At the end of fifteen minutes a cup of hot 
water was put into the pan, and with a 
long-handled spoon was poured all over the 
chicken. After each moistening, or, as it 
is called, basting, we dredged it lightly 
with flour. A teaspoonful of salt was 
added after the dredging, and the gas 
flame of the oven was turned down so that 
the chicken would continue to cook at a 
lower temperature for an hour and a half 
in order to be thoroughly done yet tender. 
Every ten minutes or so we basted and 
dredged it and added our pared potatoes 
and the giblets tp the pan to cook three 
quarters of an hour before serving. 

83 



Kitchenette Cookery 

When all else was on the table, out of 
the oven came Mister Chickie, as plump, 
shiny, and brown as any one would wish 
to see. All cords and threads and the 
darning needle were carefully removed, lest 
our carver should encounter them in his 
carving. 

The greater part of the fat left in the 
roasting pan was poured off for future use, 
while the pan with the gravy was returned 
to the fire and the minced giblets and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt were stirred into it. Half a 
cupful of milk was added, and it was 
allowed to boil up for two minutes and 
poured into the gravy bowl. The rest — 
there were only bones left to tell the tale. 

A SUNDAY DINNER FOR FRIENDS 

They said they liked this dinner, these 
two guests of mine, and they certainly 
didn't do any perfunctory nibbling. To

be served lamb, though, on a Sunday and 
when one is a guest, must have been 
somewhat of a shock. I was a Uttle du- 
bious myself, for he was a traveling man 
used to hotel service, and she hadn't kept 
house for nearly four years, but was 
regularly eating where dinners cost seventy- 
five cents a cover. 

A peculiar circumstance made me ven- 
ture to invite them. He had declared that 
ten years hence no woman would cook — 
they would all consider it beneath them; 
and I wanted him to see my playthings 
that made me contradict his prophecy with 
a "You just wait until we women have 
our kitchens fitted up as conveniently for 
work as you men have your offices, and 
see if we don't love to cook." I couldn't 
resist showing off my pet, the large pres- 
sure cooker (I am charging up to entertain- 
ment the greater part of the fourteen 
dollars paid for it), so instead of roasting 

85 



Kitchenette Cookery 

my stuffed breast of lamb for an hour and 
a quarter in the oven, I roasted it a la 
the cooker. 

The meat I had was but two pounds of 
a breast of lamb. By cutting between the 
bones and flesh a pocket was made which 
was stuffed with slices of tart apples 
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. With 
my kitchen darning needle I caught to- 
gether the edges with a few stitches and 
browned the roll in butter for five minutes 
in the bottom of the cooker placed directly 
over the flame, then lifted it up by means 
of the double fork or "crab" in order to 
insert a wire rack for it to rest upon during 
the remainder of the cooking. The meat 
was seasoned with salt and pepper, four 
washed and brushed potatoes were laid 
in beside it, and a cup of hot water poured 
into the kettle. 

The cover clamped on, the heat was 
turned on for eight minutes imtil tiie

Experiments Tried on Friends 

pressure gauge told us — both Mr. and 
Mrs. Guest were watching with interest 
now — that the lamb was being cooked in 
steam at twenty pounds' pressure. The 
flame was lowered to keep this tempera- 
ture for ten minutes; it was only out of 
respect for the lamb that I didn't let the 
pressure go up to thirty pounds, when the 
safety valve would exhaust with a shrill 
whistle, for the fun of startling my guests. 
I let the kettle do it once when cooking 
macaroni and had to call my dish macaroni 
a la Du Pont, for each little macaroni 
stick exploded. 

At the end of ten minutes of cooking 
under twenty pounds' pressure, I turned 
off the gas, allowed it to cool for five 
minutes imtil the pressure was down to 
zero, then carried the cooker to the open 
window and turned the exhaust valve, 
letting all the unpleasant lamby smell pass 
off with the steam to the outside air. 

87 



Kitchenette Cookery 

While the cooker was taking care of the 
lamb, the macaroni was cooked, salad 
made, and coffee put on to percolate. In 
just one hour to the minute we sat down 
to the following dinner :

CHAPTER X 
A BITE TO EAT AT BEDTIME 

The American habit of nibbling must 
have its wants suppHed even in a kitchen- 
ette apartment. Here it is a simpler matter 
to open the big doors separating the kitchen- 
ette from the living room and prepare the 
dishes on the gas stove than to get out a 
chafing dish. 

Bedtime bites vary from simple nibbles 
of toasted wafers and cheese to the more 
elaborate lobster Newburg, or oyster stew. 
Shellfish seem to belong naturally to late- 
hour dining. 

Cream Cheese Toasted Wafers 
Soften a cream cheese, spread on crisp 
salted wafers, and lightly brown in a 
quick oven. Serve with hot cocoa.

Pimiento Cheese Wafers 
Soften a pimiento cheese, add a bit of 
cream, and spread on salted wafers. Serve

" Slum GuUey " 

New England boys named this dish 
"Slum GuUey", although it is really de- 
rived from the Tourquemada. Adapted to 
kitchenette preparation, it is made as 
follows in the aluminum skillet : 

3 tablespoonfuls butter IJ cupfuls tomatoes 

1 green pepper or two 2 eggs 

pimientos Salted crackers 

1 small onion J teaspoonful of salt 

Cut fine both pepper and onion, and 
brown them in the butter. Add the tomato 
and salt and let it cook up. Beat up two 
eggs, pour into the mixture, and cook gently 
for just a moment until the egg thickens a 
bit. Serve at once on salted crackers.

boiler placed directly over the flame, and 
add the tomatoes. When it again cooks up, 
salt it, and add the crab meat; place over 
the lower part of the double boiler filled 
with hot water and let it simmer for ten 
minutes. Serve on pieces of crisp toast 
or crackers.

1 small can tuna fish 1 green pepper 

1 grapefruit French dressing 

Open the small can of tuna fish, turn out

odor. Shred the green pepper and cut 
out the sections of the grapefruit ; serve on 
a bed of crisp lettuce in a salad bowl. 
Pour the French dressing over just be- 
fore serving. 

Oyster Salad 

1 dozen oysters 2 tablespoonfuls pre- 

J cupful whipped cream pared horse-radish 
1 cucumber | teaspoonful salt 

1 pimiento J teaspoonful paprika 

1 tablespoonful lemon juice 

Parboil the oysters and cut into pieces, 
mix with sHced cucumbers and pimiento, 
and serve on crisp lettuce with a cream 
dressing. To make the dressing, mix 

93

thoroughly the salt, paprika, lemon juice, 
and horse-radish and fold into it the whipped 
cream. 

Pepper, Grapefruit, and Tomato Salad 

1 green pepper 1 grapefruit 

3 tomatoes French dressing 

Cook the green pepper in boiling water 
for one minute and cool. Remove the 
grapefruit sections, cut tomatoes into sec- 
tions instead of slices, and shred the pepper. 
Mix with French dressing and serve on 
crisp lettuce leaves. 

Shrimp Salad 
Remove the shrimps from the can and 
let stand in ice water for half an hour. 
Drain on a soft paper towel, remove in- 
testinal veins, and cut into half -inch pieces. 
Let stand for half an hour, mix with a French 
dressing, and serve on lettuce with mayon- 
naise dressing.

Mayonnaise Dressing 

1 egg yolk J teaspoonful salt 

2 tablespoonf uls vine- 1 cupful oil 

gar (olive or cottonseed) 

2 tablespoonfuls lemon ^ teaspoonful pepper 
juice I teaspoonful mustard 

1^ teaspoonful paprika 

To make a quick mayonnaise that will 
not curdle requires the use of utensils and 
materials that are equally cold. Fill the 
lower part of a double boiler with ice 
water. Place the upper boiler over this, 
and mix the pepper, paprika, and mustard. 
To this add the beaten egg yolk, mix 
thoroughly, and slowly add the vinegar 
and the lemon juice. With the Dover egg 
beater beat this up and add the oil by the 
half teaspoonful until three or four table- 
spoonfuls of it have been added. Con- 
tinuing the beating with the Dover egg 
beater, add the remainder of the oil more 
rapidly, and at the very last add the salt. 
Serve on salad.

CHAPTER XI 

HALF-A-CAN RECIPES 

One of the difficulties of using canned 
goods in cooking for one or two is that 
only part of a can can be eaten at one 
time, and we do not always know just 
what to do with the rest. Because I found 
this trying, I began to play tricks on my 
canned goods and reduced some of my 
old-time standard recipes to fit my smaller 
pans. In this way I learned a variety of 
ways for using each can, so that there is 
neither waste nor a needless repetition of 
dishes. With the necessarily small refriger- 
ator of a kitchenette, it is likewise impossible 
to keep a lot of left-overs, so by using these 
recipes I avoid them. 

In opening a can of any vegetable, and 
96 



Half-a-Can Recipes 

sometimes of fruit that is not to be served 
again for a week or so, I pour it out at once, 
always at once, one half to be used and the 
other half put into a saucepan to be heated 
up to the boiling point and poured into a 
sterilized half-pint jar. After sealing and 
cooling, these can be set into the refrigera- 
tor. It takes but a few minutes to do this, 
but it saves a monotonous repetition of the 
same food. 

Canned goods used most frequently in 
this way are corn, peas, tomatoes, asparagus, 
string beans, lima beans, baked beans, beets, 
and salmon. All but the beets are used 
for cream soups. I have one basic recipe 
which can be adapted to any vegetable in 
making a cream soup to serve ^two or three 
persons. 

Basic Recipe for Eight Cream Soups 

1 tablespoonful butter 2 cupfuls milk 

1 tablespoonful flour J teaspoonful salt 

I to 1 cupful vegetable pulp 

97 



Kitchenette Cookery 

Melt the butter, add the flour and salt, 
and remove from the flame while stirring 
in the milk. Cook up the vegetable and 
mash through a strainer, or merely dice 
up very fine and heat for a hurry-up soup. 
Cook up the milk and flour, and when it 
has boiled for three minutes pour in the 
hot vegetable pulp — except in tomato soup. 
Remove from the fire at once, give it a few 
turns with the Dover egg beater, and serve. 

Seven Creamed Dishes 

The only difference between the cream 
soups and creamed dishes is that for the 
one tablespoonful each of butter and flour, 
one cupful instead of two cupfuls of milk 
is used, and the vegetables are added whole 
or in pieces rather than mashed. Com, 
peas, asparagus, string beans, lima beans, 
beets, and salmon are all delicious when 
served in this way. They may be served 
on hot toast, in little toasted bread cases 
98 



Half-a-Can Recipes 

made by cutting out boxes of stale bread 
and buttering and toasting them in the oven, 
or in pattie cases. Baking-powder biscuit 
dough can be used for pattie cases by roll- 
ing out to a quarter of an inch in thickness 
and cutting two rounds, cutting a smaller 
round out of one of these. The ring so 
made is placed on top of the first round, 
moistened with a bit of milk to unite them 
in the baking. With a sharp-pointed knife 
cut out the soft center part and fill with 
the creamed dish made.
