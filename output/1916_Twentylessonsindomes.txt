INTRODUCTORY 



MARKETING 

(Family Budget) 

System must be used in directing the marketing for the family. 

One essential to proper marketing is a family budget. The budget 
for food must be subdivided to establish just how much money can be 
expended for various provisions. In this respect the value of the knowl- 
edge of a balanced ration is apparent. Without such knowledge the dis- 
penser of the budget is like a ship without a rudder. 

The family in moderate circumstances with a smaller budget must 
figure more closely than those in affluence; the family in poor circum- 
stances can more easily and properly provide for the family needs by 
keeping a budget. In fact, the latter has greater need of a budget for 
expenses than the former. 

Certain days should be marked as days for purchase of certain pro- 
visions. This may be determined by local markets. 

The writer has not found the PARCELS POST altogether a satis- 
factory method of procuring produce — your local merchants who are, 
perchance, your neighbors, will feel a more intimate need for providing 
the quality commensurate with price than someone fifty or one hundred 
and fifty miles away, to whom you cannot return undesirable merchandise. 

There is no food problem so complex as scientific marketing, com- 
plex because so many elements enter into a day's dietary. 



BALANCED RATION 

Always bear one thing in mind, the necessity of a ration which will 
provide necessary combinations to appease hunger, to furnish warmth, 
energy and tissue building material as well as to please the palate and the 
eye. 

However, too much attention is often given to pleasing the palate 
rather than to furnishing nutrition. In planning each meal the bulky 
starchy foods predominate in quantity, the proteins second, fats and 
sweets third, while there should be sufficient liquid to act as a dissolving 
and distributing agent. 



METHODS OF COOKING 

• • . ~ ■ ■ ■ ' 

Baking : Cooking by hot air confined in an oven. 

Slow Oven : Temperature is about 250 to 300 degrees Fahr. 

Moderate Open : Temperature is about 350 to 400 degrees Fahr. 

Hot Oven ; Temperature is 400 to 450 degrees Fahr. 

Very Hot Oven : Temperature is 450 to 550 degrees Fafir. 

. Broiling : • Is applying intense heat by means of open fire to sear the 
surfaces of fish or meat, then reducing heat until food is cooked. Tem- 
perature is 375 to 400 degrees Fahr. 

Boiling : Cooking food in water at 212 degrees Fahr. 

Liquids, heavier than plain water, reach a heat greater than 212 degrees Fahr., 
which is greatest heat of boiling water. Water heavily salted reaches more than 
212 degrees. 

Milk boilg at 214 degrees Fahr. 

Milk scalds at 196 degrees Fahr, when in double boiler. 

Milk is pasteurized at 165 degrees Fahr., holding at that temperature twenty 
minutes.. 

Milk is sterilized at 212 degrees Fahr., holding that temperature half an hour. 

Simmering : Cooking food in water below boiling point or about 185 
degrees Fahr. 

Braising: Cooking food in slow oven with moisture surrounding 
food in the pan. 

Stewing : Cooking at 186 degrees Fahr. 

Poaching: Cooking at 160-180 degrees Fahr. 

Frying : Cooking in deep fats or oils : 

First. Fat should be hot enough to prevent article absorbing it. 

Second. Fat should entirely submerge the article. 

Third. Article should not be wet or very cold. 

Fourth. Some food requires special protection of egg and crumbs 
to prevent breaking apart or absorbing fat. 

Fifth. All foods, after frying, should be drained on unglazed paper 
to eliminate superfluous fat. 

Vegetable Oils are better for frying than lard or other animal fats, 
as they do not burn at as low a temperature and are not as readily ab- 
sorbed by the food. 

Batters and Doughs are the usual forms in which flour is used. 

Thin Batter: One measure of liquid plus one and one-half measure 
of flour. 

Very Thin Batter : One measure of liquid to one measure of flour. 

Drop Dough : One measure of liquid to two measures of flour. 

8 



METHODS OF COOKING 



Stiff Dough : One measure of liquid to three measures of flour. 

Leavening: Leavening other than yeast or baking powder is pro- 
duced when SODA is added to neutralize the acid of SOUR MILK or 
MOLASSES. The gas thus formed is not as easily controlled, nor is it 
sufficient for the amount of flour which would be required to complete a 
mixture. Caution must be observed, therefore, in the combination of 
soda with such acids as are found in sour milk and molasses, not to use 
too much soda. The rule is to use just enough soda to neutralize the acid, 
then use one-half as much baking powder (CALUMET) as the same 
recipe would demand when made with sweet milk. The sweeter molasses 
and syrups do not require nearly as much soda as the black molasses. 
The sweeter or fresh buttermilk and the just turned milk do not require 
nearly as much soda as the longer standing buttermilk and the com-, 
pletely soured milk. 

Rule for Use of Soda: One level teaspoon soda to two cups com- 
pletely soured milk. 

One-half level teaspoon soda to two cups just turned milk. 

One level teaspoon soda to one cup dark molasses. 

Rule for Use of Baking Powder: One level teaspoon of baking 
powder to each level cup of pastry flour in bread or cake making. 

One and one-half level teaspoon of baking powder to each level cup 
of bread flour. 

The teaspoon rounded or struck off on the edge of the can equals 
two level teaspoons and is more easily measured off by busy cooks than 
by leveling and then dividing. 

To level a teaspoon, draw a knife oyer edges. 



Important Equivalents to Memorize 



1 quart flour (about) is equivalent to 1 pound avoirdupois 
1 pint sugar (about) is equivalent to 1 pound avoirdupois. 
1 pint butter (about) is equivalent to 1 pound avoirdupois. 
1 quart is equivalent to 4 cups, liquid measure. 
1 pint is equivalent to 2 cups, liquid measure.' 
y 2 ^ pint is equivalent to 1 cup, liquid measure. 

1 cup is equivalent to 2 gills. 

2 gills are equivalent to 8 fluid ounces. 

16 level tablespoons are equivalent to 1 cup liquid measure. 

8 level tablespoons are equivalent to % cup liquid measure; 
4 level tablespoons are equivalent to ,% cup liquid measure. 

1 level tablespoon is equivalent to 3 level teaspoonfuls. 

2 level tablespoons sugar are equivalent to 1 ounce avoirdupois. 
2 level tablespoons butter are equivalent to 1 ounce avoirdupois. 

4 level tablespoons cocoa or flour is equivalent to 1 ounce avoirdupois. 

2 level tablespoons liquid is equivalent to 1 ounce avoirdupois. 

3 level teaspoons are equivalent to 1 tablespoonful. 
2 level teaspoons are equivalent to 1 dessertspoonful. 

. 1 square of chocolate is equivalent to 1 ounce of chocolate. 
1 square of grated chocolate is equivalent to 4 level tablespoons of chocolate. 

9 or 10 eggs, depending upon size, are equivalent to 1 pound. 
1 lemon, juice of, is equivalent to about 4 tablespoons. 

: 1 cup of egg white is equivalent to about 8 egg whites. 
■ 1 cup of egg yolk is equivalent to about 12 egg yolks. 
1 cup of shelled nuts is equivalent to about 4 ounces. 
Measures are always level, unless otherwise stated. 

Directions for Measuring 

Dip the spoon into the materials and strike off with straight edge of a knife.] 
, In measuring butter, lard or margarine, pack the cup or spoon closely and 
strike off with the straight edge of a knife. 

In measuring flour in the "cup measure, tap the measure lightly to insure 
against unfilled spaces. 

To measure % teaspoon divide a level teaspoonful lengthwise. 

To measure % teaspoon divide the half teaspoon once crosswise. 

A heaping measure, whether . spoonful or cupful, means all the measure 
will hold. 

A teaspoon dipped full and drawn under the side of the can of CALUMET 
Baking Powder gives practically a teaspoon and a half. This is a quick method 
to measure the one and one-half teaspoon to each cup of flour in making breads, 
biscuit, muffins, etc. 

In measuring CALUMET for cakes, dip the teaspoon full and level with a 
knife, one teaspoonful for each cupful of sifted flour. . 

The measuring cups for kitchen use vary in size. Most of the glass and 
aluminum are the half pint liquid measure. The half pint dry measuring cup, 
which is not easily distinguished, hold two level tablespoonfuls more than the 
liquid measure. 

The half pint based on the dry pint measure was the original measuring cup 
for kitchen use. But manufacturers are now generally making the kitchen 
measuring cup to conform to the United States Bureau of Standards, standard 
liquid measure. The small difference between the liquid and dry measure carries 
little effect in the making of breads and cakes, so long as the several ingredients 
are measured in the same size cup to insure proper proportions.

Lesson Number One 



The Function of Food 

Hutchinson defines food as "anything which, when taken into the 
body, is capable of repairing its waste, or of furnishing it with material 
from which to produce heat for nervous and muscular work." 

The two main functions of food are to provide warmth and energy, 
and to build tissue or repair waste. Energy includes muscular and nerve 
strength. 

Certain foods provide energy but cannot rebuild tissues, while 
others provide energy and rebuild as well; nevertheless, some^ mis- 
guided housewives work on the principle that "a merciful Providence 
fashioned us 'holler' " and simply provide for filling this "holler" with- 
out reference to the real function of food. Food, therefore, must be 
selected with care, and a well-balanced ration must be the housewife's 
study. 

In this connection, three aspects at once present themselves for our 
consideration, viz.: the physiological, the economical and the moral. 
Vegetarians defend their theory of living with the plea that their prac- 
tice is conducive to a healthier and longer life and to a better moral 
temperament tnan the use of, a mixed diet; that it is less costly to the 
state and to the individual ; and that the slaughter of animals for food is 
inhuman. However much weight their arguments may bear upon the 
individual, there are always present the habits which mankind has ac- 
quired and which enter largely into, or are controlled by, our pursuits 
as a whole. 

"We come now to .the relation of food to the human system as to its 
assimilation and digestion. The kitchen is the chemical laboratory in 
which our food is converted from its crude state to a condition that is 
at once suitable and palatable. 

The application of heat to various foods affects differently their 
condition for easy assimilation by the digestive system. Heat, when ap- 
plied to meat, partially coagulates some of the proteins contained therein, 
thus rendering them less easy to assimilate, but on the other hand heat 
and moisture convert the insoluble connective tissues into soluble gelatin 
and thus the fibers are made easier of digestion. At the same time cook- 
ing kills disease germs, and parasites which are sometimes present. 

COOKING is also of great importance in facilitating the digestion 
of vegetable foods. The action of heat and moisture breaks down the 
cellulose, bursts the starch grains and allows the digestive fluids to act 
more freely. 

APPLICATION OP HEAT: After the ambitious young house- 
wife has labored conscientiously to prepare for the oven her various pies, 
cakes and breads, observing accurate measure, proper consistency and 
careful mixing, she is often at a loss as to why her efforts have resulted in 
dismal failure or perhaps only a near success. 

11 



LESSON No. 1 Domestic Science 



Such disappointment is nearly always caused through ignorance of 
the proper application of heat to the different articles to be baked. The 
following general rules will assist in securing the proper results. 

Do not hurry the baking of bread, cakes or pies. Flour contains 
much starch, which must be thoroughly cooked, for the digestion or as- 
similation of raw or uncooked starch is comparatively slow and difficult. 
Have the oven at moderate heat to start the baking of these articles. It 
is also well to know that if the loaf of yeast bread is not well baked in the 
center, the yeast germ or plant, given the warmth and moisture of the 
digestive apparatus, will resume its work of fermentation, thus causing 
serious digestive inconvenience. 

The medium loaf of bread requires about forty-five minutes. 

Fruit pies should bake half an hour at least. Small tea biscuits 
require from ten to twelve minutes. Cake should not be allowed to 
brown until the mixture has risen to its full height, and is not ready to 
be taken from the oven until the surface near the center of the cake will, 
spring back under a slight pressure of the finger. 

Fruit pies have an annoying habit of leaking juice when not prop-' 
erly put together. No such difficulty will be experienced if three level 
tablespoons of flour are mixed well with the sugar that is used for each 
pie. A final precaution is to moiston the rim or edge of the under pastry' 
before pressing the upper one closely to it. 

* * ♦:« 

Food Principles 

For convenience, food is divided in five classes: "Water, Protein, 
Fats, Carbohydrates, and Mineral Matter. 

WATER ranks next to. air as an essential to life. We will treat it 
only in its relation to food preparation. 

Uses: "We have constant use for water in the body. It quenches 
thirst; it aids in regulating body temperature; it aids digestion since it 
forms a part of all digestive secretions of the body and acts as a solvent, 
dissolving most substances and reducing them to a condition to be used 
in the body; it acts as a carrier; it enters into the formation of blood 
which carries building material to the various parts of the system, and 
it also carries off waste. "Water constitutes about 65 per cent of the body. 

The necessity for a clean sanitary source of water supply cannot be 
too strongly urged. If any uncertainty exists in regard to the water 
for food purposes it should be analyzed. Impure water cannot be always 
detected by color, taste or smell. Boiling will purify most water by de- 
stroying the bacteria, but boiling also changes its taste by removing 
mineral salts and dissolved gases. After water is boiled, pouring from 
one vessel to another, holding one considerably above the other, will 
restore some of the oxygen which has been driven out by boiling process. 

CAUTIONS IN THE USE OF WATER: Do not use water left 
standing in open vessels. Use freshly boiled water for tea, coffee and 
cocoa. Keep kettles free from lime deposit that accumulates in the 
bottom.

Domestic Science LESSON No. 1 

Classification of Foods as Organic and Inorganic 

(A) Organic foods are of animal and vegetable origin and include : 

1. Proteins such as 

a Albumen; b Casein; c Fibrin; d Gelatin; e Extractives; f Gluten; g Legumin. 

Protein contains nitrogen. It is a muscle builder and is the food con- 
stituent that makes and repairs tissue. Foods rich in protein are lean 
meat, dried peas, beans, lentils, milk and cheese : Gelatin is not a real 
protein, and is not of such great food value. Protein like carbohydrates 
and fats, is capable of furnishing warmth and energy to the body. 

2. Carbohydrates such as 

Starch: Cereals, potatoes, roots. \ 

Sugar: Cane, beet, fruit sugars. > Vegetable carbohydrates 

Cellulose : Fruit and vegetable fiber. ) 

Mn C k°Iuga r r animal 8tarCh \ Animal carbohydrates. 

CARBOHYDRATES give heat and energy. 

Foods rich in carbohydrates include the starchy vegetables, as po- 
tatoes, cereals and their products, as flours, macaroni, spaghetti, noodles, 
breads, muffins, cake, biscuit, crackers, cornstarch and cereal puddings, 
etc., also tapioca, bananas and cocoa. Carbohydrates include the sweets, 
as cakes, icings, candies, preserves, jelly, rich breads, cookies, sweet pud- 
dings, stewed fruit, honey, syrups and sugary foods. 

3. Fats or reserve-force foods are constituents of meats and fish, 
cream, butter, margarine, cream soup, cheese, olive, cottonseed and nut 
oils, ripe olives, nuts, rich pastry, suet pudding, fritters, all foods cooked 
in fats or oils, chocolate. 

Fats like carbohydrates are valuable foods in that they produce 
warmth or energy. Weight for weight, fats produce 214 times the heat 
produced by carbohydrates or proteins. 

(B) Inorganic foods include : 

4. Mineral matter found in the ash of foods, consists of com- 
pounds of sodium, lime, iron, potash, sulphur, phosphorous. They are 
found principally in cereals, milk, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and in 
J solution in water. 

5. Water does not give heat or energy, but is useful in tissue build- 
ing. The controlled evaporation of water from the body keeps it at a 
uniform temperature. Even solid foods contain large amounts of water. 

Mineral salts and water enter into the composition of all tissues of 
the body. 

13 



LESSON No. 1 Domestic Science 



ASSIMILATION 

"THE IDEAL DIET is that combination of food which, while im- 
posing the least burden upon the body, supplies it with exactly sufficient 
material to meet its wants. ' ' ( Schuster. ) 

The man weighing 160 pounds and doing a moderate amount of 
muscular work requires the following amounts of food : 

Three to five ounces of protein and sufficient carbohydrates and fat 
combined to produce 3,000 to 3,500 Calories. In this connection it may 
be stated that the food is ultimately burned, in the body. This burning 
takes place slowly, and is known as oxidation.* 

3,500 Calories is about equivalent to the amount of heat produced by 
burning a pound of coal. 

The problem of a proper diet must be laid out along the. lines above 
indicated! But the matter is far more complicated than would appear. 
Many other things must be considered. The proteins found in different 
foods, are not all the same. The casein of milk is different from the 
albumen of the egg. Experiments have shown that some proteins are 
more completely digested than others, and only the amount digested is of 
food value. 

/Then again different people have what are called idiosyncrasies, 
peculiar physical conditions precluding the use of foods common to the 
majority, though otherwise the person is physically normal. In catering 
to these peculiarities, or to preference in tastes, we must all the more bear 
in mind the necessity of proper amounts of the different food materials, 
protein, carbohydrates and fat. 



THE DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS as placed by Atwater is, viz. : 

1st. The protein of ordinary animal foods may be readily and 
completely digested. 

2nd. The protein of vegetable foods is much less easily digested 
than that of animal foods. 

3rd. Animal fats are not as easily digested as vegetable oils. 

jith. Sugar and starch furnish heat and energy quickly. 

5th. Animal foods contain more proteins than vegetable foods and 
are more easily digested. 

A diet of animal food leaves very little undigested matter. 



•A Calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilo- 
gram of water 1° centigrade or 1 pound of water 4' Fahr.

Lesson Number Two 



Leavening Agents 

"The common leavening agents in use in the home are yeast and 
baking powder. Yeast is a microscopic plant which, in the leavening 
process, produces changes which finally result in the breaking .up of 
sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxid gas. Baking powder is a mixture 
of several substances which produce this same gas by chemical action. 
This gas, by forming in small bubbles throughout the dough mass, light- 
ens or leavens it. Carbon dioxid gas is sometimes called carbonic acid 
gas. This is the gas which is present in all carbonated waters, whether 
natural as in springs or artificial as in soda fountain waters." 

N. B. — The text of this chapter is taken with the permission of the 
author, Thomas G. Atkinson, from Domestic Science Text Book, Baking 
Powder, A Healthful, Convenient Leavening Agent. 

Baking Powder a Necessity 

Baking powder has done much to lighten and decrease the hours 
of labor of the housewife. It has made possible the easy and rapid 
production of many new, dainty and nutritious foods. The best powder 
may be purchased at a mdoerate price and the wholesomeness of the food 
prepared therefrom need not be questioned. That it is a convenience 
that cannot be dispensed with is appreciated most by those who use it 
most intelligently 

Use of Baking Powder 

The use of baking powder has become very general throughout the 
United States. The Memorial of the American Baking Powder Associ- 
ation presented in Congress in 1900 shows that at that time there was 
produced annually baking powders of the different types, as follows : 

Tons used per annum : Manufacturing concerns : 

Alum, 50,000 644' Alum and alum-phosphate 

Cream of tartar, 9,000 10 

Phosphate, 300 1 

The directions for the use of baking powder in general call for two 
heaping teaspoons to a quart of flour. This amount is unnecessary with 
the stronger powders, and makes a poorer instead of a better biscuit. 
The housewife will obtain better results if she uses the smaller proportion 
called for in the directions given by the manufacturer. With the stronger 
baking powders one heaping teaspoonful to a quart of floflr is a great 
sufficiency. To use more than directed means to introduce an unneces- 
sary amount of residue in the finished food. 

How to Measure 

Always measure the baking powder by the level teaspoonful. Scrape 
the straight edge of a knife across the spoon, keeping the blade pressed 
to the sides of the bowl. In this way you will always get the same 
amount.

LESSON No. 2 Domes tic Science 

Advantages of Baking Powder 

With a properly compounded baking powder, the chemical reaction* 
will always be the same, v and any influence which it may exert upon the 
flavors of the finished food will always be the same. Baking powder has 
these two advantages over yeast: (1) The gas is given off at once upon 
the addition of water or in the oven during the heating; (2) and the 
presence of butter, lard or eggs does not hinder the chemical action. 

The leavening, from whichever source, is always the result of the 
same gas, carbon dioxid, and in the study of bakmg powder we are 
interested in learning how this gas is produced by chemical action. 

Sources of Carbon Dioxide 

Carbon dioxid is found in nature combined chemically with many 
metals, and these combinations are known as salts of carbonic acid, or 
more commonly as carbonates. Those with which one is most familiar 
are chalk, marble and limestone, all of which are different forms of 
calcium carbonate. If any of these are heated to a very high tempera- 
ture, carbon dioxid gas is set free and lime remains ; but this very high 
temperature is never reached in baking. Baking soda is another car- 
bonate with which all are familiar. 

The Ingredients of Baking Powder Soda 

Soda is the carbonate which is used at home for cooking purposes ; 
it is also commonly known as saleratus, or baking soda. This is the- 
carbonate used almost exclusively in the manufacture of baking powder 
and always named on the label as soda. It is sometimes referred to as 
the alkali of the baking powder. It is a white crystalline substance' of 
very high purity, being ras free from impurities as granulated sugar. It 
is manufactured from common salt through the action of acid ammonium 
carbonate. 

The reaction is represented by the following equation : 
NaCl pluB NH« HCO, equals NaH CO a plus NH CI 
v Salt Acid Ammonium Soda Ammonium 

Carbonate Chloride 

Soda; when heated, readily gives off carbon dioxid gas, and hence 
may be, and often is, used in cooking without the addition of any other 
substance for the purpose of leavening. The heat, however, does not 
drive off all of the gas. The reaction which takes place is represented 
by the following formula: 

SNaHCO, equals NaaC0 8 plus H 2 plus C0 2 

Soda Normal sodium Water Carbon 

Carbonate Dioxid 

The residue of normal sodium carbonate thus left in the bread gives 
it a disagreeable, alkaline taste, and also colors the bread an objectionable 
yellow; hence, soda by itself is unsatisfactory for use as 'a leavening 
agent. 

32 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 2 

Ammonium Carbonate 

Ammonium carbonate has been sometimes used as a leavening agent. 
This, upon being heated, breaks up into two different gases, ammonia 
gas and carbon dioxid gas. Some of the ammonia gas remains in the 
bread when cooked ; therefore, its use in baking powder has been almost 
entirely discontinued. 

Magnesium Carbonate 

Magnesium Carbonate is the only other substance at present used 
for the purpose of furnishing carbon dioxid gas. The heat of the oven 
is not sufficient in this case to cause all the gas to be set free. Magnesium 
carbonate is a very light powder. One pound will occupy as much space 
as six pounds of soda. The purpose of those who Use this ingredient 
in the manufacture of baking powder is mainly to add to the bulk of 
the powder and thus make the thoughtless purchaser believe she is getting 
raore^ for her money. 

Other Substances Necessary- 
It will be seen from what has just been said, that none of these car- 
bonates are, of themselves alone, satisfactory for baking purposes. Some- 
thing else is necessary. 

If one has ever dropped a little vinegar on some soda, he has noticed 
that a gas was set free. This is carbon dioxide gas. Vinegar contains 
an acid, acetic acid, and it is the action of this acid upon the soda that 
sets free the gas. Any soluble acid will have this same action on soda, 
hence, if we unite such an acid with the carbonate, soda, we have the 
necessary substances with which to produce carbon dioxid gas. 

The Acid Substance 

For the making of baking powder, both acid and carbonate, how- 
ever, must be dry substances, and not liquid, like acetic acid of vinegar. 
The acid should also dissolve in water. There are many such dry acids, 
most of them organic substances. Citric acid, the principal acid con- 
tained in lemons, is one of these. Tartaric acid is another. 

Beside the true acids, there are some salts which have an acid nature 
and which are called acid salts. Of these, calcium acid phosphate, com- 
monly called acid phosphate, is one, and potassium acid tartrate, com- 
monly known as cream of tartar, is another. There are some salts which 
are not acid salts (inasmuch as all of the hydrogen atoms of the acid 
have been replaced by a metal) which nevertheless act as very weak 
acids. The most common of these is sodium aluminum sulphate, some- 
times called "Alum." 

Any of these three kinds of substances, the acid, the acid salt, or 
the salt with acid properties, acts upon soda and sets free carbon dioxid 
gas. The action takes place almost as quickly as the "acid" or salt 
dissolves. These substances just mentioned, acid phosphate, "Alum," 
tartaric acid and cream of tartar, together with the soda, are the active 

33 



LESSON No. 2 Domestic Science 



"principles in baking powder. In addition to these there is generally a 
quantity "of starch and sometimes dried white of egg. Soda has been 
studied. The other substances must€iow be considered. 

Tartaric Acid and Cream of Tartar 

Tartaric acid is manufactured from Argol, which is the sediment 
that separates out at the bottom of the, wine vat during the fermenta- 
tion. This substance is colored by the color from the grapes, and is a 
mixture of tartaric acid, calcium tartrate, cream of .tartar and all kinds 
of organic impurities. This mixture is» dissolved in water, precipitated 
with powdered chalk and calcium chloride, filtered and then the precipi- 
tated calcium tartrate is dissolved in sulphuric acid. This solution is 
again filtered and treated with some decolorizing agent, such as bone 
black or infusorial earth, and the subsequent clear, colorless solution 
evaporated and the tartaric acid allowed to crystallize. Cream of tartar 
is also obtained from the same sediment, Argol.. It is decolorized by 
heating with animal charcoal, filtered and recrystallized. 

Acid Phosphate 

Calcium Acid Phosphate is prepared from the same source as is 
much of the "Phosphate," used at soda fountains. The bones from 
healthy cattle are heated in large revolving cylinders until they are 
thoroughly charred. In this condition the mass is black and is known as 
bone black, although in/reality it consists of both calcium phosphate and 
charcoal. This substance is use^d to decolorize the juices of the cane in 
the manufacture of cane sugar. In the manufacture of phosphate It is 
again heated to a very high temperature whereby all charcoal is burned 
off and only the calcium phosphate remains. It is then further purified, 
concentrated, crystallized and dried to a white powder. 

A more recent process is the manufacture of phosphate for food 
purposes from phosphate rock. This material was not formerly used 
on account of the great difficulty -of excluding from the finished acid 
(phosphate the harmful impurities, fluorides, always found in the rock. 
Bone phosphate is the better on this account and is always used by the 
careful manufacturer of high grade baking pOwder. 

Calcium acid phosphate for baking powder is prepared in two 
degrees of fineness, powdered and granular. The granular (the acid 
phosphate as found in Calumet Baking Powder is of the granular type) 
jis much more expensive but has the great advantage of making a baking 
powder that will keep longer than one made from powdered phosphate. 

"Alum" 

The so-called "Alum" used in baking powder is not the alum which 
jis sold at the drug store by that name. The common alum of trade, 
iwhich is also used as medicine, contains potassium, an element that is 
!toxic in very small quantities, and water of crystallization ; it is, in fact, 

, 34 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 2 



potassium aluminum sulphate, combined with water of crystallization, 
K AL (S0J 2 12 (H 2 0). The so-called "alum" of baking powder is a 
different thing and is more properly named sodium aluminum sulphate, 
being a mixture of sodium sulphate and aluminum sulphate, both of them 
harmless and non-toxic. It contains neither potassium nor water of 
crystallization. The term alum has been used for this article on baking 
powder labels at the request of some food commissioners who felt that 
this word would be better understood by the common people as showing 
in a general way the character of the substance. Unfortunately, it has 
had the very different effect of misleading the public into the 
erroneous idea that it actually is the alum of commerce and of medicine — 
a mistake of which certain manufacturers have not failed to take advan- 
tage in decrying baking powder containing alum. 

It is prepared by mixing solutions of two sulphates, sodium sulphate 
and aluminum sulphate, concentrating the mixture and fusing the result- 
ing dried mass. This leaves a mixture which for our present purposes 
we may designate by the formula : 

Na Al (SO.), 

Sodium Aluminum Sulphate 

There is no potassium in this substance at all, as there is in the 
common alum, and no ammonia as in the less common ammonium alum. 



Starch 

We also find that besides the soda and the "acid," starch is used in 
baking powder. This starch is corn starch of the highest grade of purity 
and specially prepared for food purposes. 

The starch serves three purposes, two of which play an important 
part in keeping the baking powder from spoiling, while the third adds 
to the efficiency of its use. 

FIRST : It separates the soda from the acid or acid acting salt and 
thus by mechanically separating them retards such chemical action as 
could be brought about by moisture. The air always contains moisture. 
This is very noticeable on rainy days, but it escapes attention in fair 
weather. Not only is carbon dioxide set free when water or milk is poured 
on the baking powder, but even the moisture in the air gradually causes 
the change. Moisture from any source thus spoils the powder. 

SECOND : Starch absorbs water and thus prevents moisture from 
bringing the active ingredients in contact with each other. In this way 
it aids materially in keeping the powder from spoiling. Starch is, for 
these reasons, a necessary ingredient of baking powders, and most 
especially necessary in the case of straight phosphate baking powders, 
which, even when starch is present, deteriorate very rapidly. 

THIRD: Starch also dilutes the strength of the baking powder, 
so that it may be made to produce the amount of gas desired for efficiency 
and for convenience in household methods of measurement. 

35 



LESSON No. 2 Domestic Science 

The laws of ai ew States require that a baking powder shall produce 
at least 10% of its weight of carbon dioxid gas. Almost all baking 
powders are made stronger than this. The majority of those .upon the 
market yield 12% of gas, while the best produce between 14% and 15%. 

White of Eggs 

There is one ingredient mentioned above, as being sometimes used 
in baking powder, which, has not yet been discussed. That is Dried 
White of Eggs, sometimes called egg albumen. It is prepared by drying 
the white of fresh eggs at a. low temperature, and then grinding to 
a fine powder'. ' Fourteen pounds of whole eggs will produce about one 
pound of this dry powder. It dissolves easily in cold water and the 
viscubus, egg-white nature of this solution holds the bubbles of gas as 
they are set free from the baking powder. "White of eggs is used by many 
manufacturers of baking powder. "This increases the efficiency of the 
carbon dioxid gas evolved by a baking powder to an extent of 2.5% 
to 3.2% when used in strong baking powders. It is extremely beneficial 
in producing light biscuits when the oven temperatures are not properly 
controlled or when the dough has to stand for some time before baking. 

The amount of dried white of egg used in baking powders is very 
small, being 15/100 of 1%. Even in this small proportion it has the 
effect above mentioned. It also makes possible a simple test whereby the 
freshness of baking powder may be determined, by the salesman in 
testing the stock upon the retailers' shelves, by the grocer himself, or 
by the housewife in the home. Both the increase in lightness and the 
possibility of the test are due to the viscous nature of the white of eggs, 
whereby the bubbles of gas are imprisoned as soon as they are set free 
by chemical action. 'This test is described by one manufacturer as 
follows: 

" First take an ordinary drinking glass holding one half pint, or in 
other words, the quantity that is usually known in the household as 'one 
cupful.' All that is needed is this empty glass, which must be dry, an 
ordinary teaspoon and a little water of the ordinary room temperature 
(not ice water nor hot water). Place two level teaspoonfuls of the 
powder in the dry glass to which add the same quantity (two teaspoon- 
fuls) of water, quickly; stir rapidly for a moment (while counting five), 
just long enough to thoroughly moisten the powder; remove the spoon 
and watch the mixture rise./- Note the action of the powder. It rises 
slowly and evenly, requiring two minutes to show the full strength. If 
the powder is of full strength, and you have proceeded properly the gas 
released will form bubbles • sufficient to half fill the glass. Caution: 
Don't attempt to make the mixture rise by continued stirring, as whip- 
ping or beating the mixture breaks the gas bubbles that are formed and 
allows the gas to escape. Allow the powder to rise of its own strength." 

Manufacturers make the following use of this test. Whenever 
complaints are made to the grocer or when goods appear to have been 
stored in damp places, or too near the stove, the salesman tests the baking 

*.» . —

powder as above described and if it is found to have deteriorated, it is 
at once exchanged for fresh goods without cost to the retailer. "Without 
this simple test it would be necessary to send the goods complained of 
to the factory for chemical analysis. As a result of such tests by the 
salesmen, deteriorated goods may be entirely removed from the market 
so that the consumer will never receive a baking powder which does not 
do its work perfectly. Of course, the above test cannot be made unless 
the white of egg is present. 

The Healthfulness of the Residues 

The healthfulness of these residues is discussed in Bulletin No. 103 
of the United States Department of Agriculture, professional paper, en- 
titled "Alum in Foods," this being the decision of the Referee Board 
after a long extended investigation. The members of this board were 
selected by the President of the United States because their high scien- 
tific knowledge, the eminent positions they occupy, and the complete 
facilities for investigation at their command, were such as to render their 
conclusions respect-impelling and final. The following is a quotation 
from the report : 

"Alum, as such, is not present in food when eaten." 



Properly Balanced Action 

A study of the keeping qualities and of the speed of action has 
resulted in the production of baking powders containing a combination 
of two of these ' ' acids. ' ' The most notable are those containing phosphate 
and "alum." The aim has been to produce a baking powder with a 
correctly balanced action, giving off a proper amount of gas in the cold, 
with a sufficiently large amount of gas that will only be given off on 
heating the mixture in the oven, and, at the same time, a powder that will 
not easily spoil. As a result of such consideration and extensive experi- 
ments, baking powders have been produced superior to any made with 
a single "acid" ingredient. Properly proportioned powders, of the 
"phosphate-alum" type, are not only the best in keeping quality, but, 
when they contain sufficient phosphate, have also the best balanced speed 
of action, and insure the housewife against the dangers either of fallen 
biscuits on the one hand or of biscuits, which have crusted over too 
quickly to obtain the desired lightness, on the other hand. 



Cost of Baking Powder 

The cost of any material used for a piece of work must be figured 
on the cost of that material for a single unit of the work to be done. 

An example of the difference in cost of baking powder is the fol- 
lowing : 

37 



LESSON No. 2 Domestic Science 

"A" sells baking powder at fifty cents per pound and directs that 
yojl use two heaping teaspoonfuls to the quart of flour. 

"B" sells baking powder at twenty-five cents per pound, and directs 
that you use two rounded teaspoonfuls to the quart of flour. 

What does it cost to leaven a quart o£ flour with "AV powder as 
compared with that of " B 's ' ' ? ~ ;;, , J1; . 

Answer — Four times as much. 

Caution: Never use more baking powder than recommended by 
the manuf ac'turer. By following directions you will get the best results. 

A baking powder that gives off nearly all of its gas in the cold, as 
does a straight phosphate or a tartaric acid and a cream of tartar baking 
powder,, will produce a large dough biscuit before being placed in the 
oven. The dough in this r case is already much distended and the gluten 
of the flour will not hold much more gas without breaking and allowing 
the gas to escape. Practically all of the gas has been set free before it 
is placed in the oven. If placed in an oven of a low temperature, any 
jarring of the floor or slamming of the door of the oven is likely to cause 
a fallen cake. This danger applies especially to straight phosphate and 
to cream of tartar and tartaric acid powders. 

Most of the widely advertised "pure cream of tartar ^baking 
powders contain tartaric acid. 



Self-Rising Flour 

Self -rising flour is nothing more than a mixture of flour and salt 
with soda and an "acid" ingredient, or in other words, with ingredients 
such as are used in making a baking powder. This mixing is almost 
always done without any chemical control of the purity or strength of 
the ingredients or of the proportioning of the ingredients. The soda and 
"acid" are purchased of the manufacturers with a formula for mixing 
them. The formula is never changed no matter how much the purity 
or strength of the ingredients may vary. Such a product subjects the 
user thereof to every inconvenience and disappointment as to flavor and 
color in the finished food, such as would result from the use of the cheap- 
est baking powder, manufactured without chemical control. Inasmuch 
as excessive quantities of the soda and acid are frequently added, the 
housewife is also preparing food containing excessive amounts of residue, 
when she uses self -rising flour. 

Because of the large amount of water contained in flour, and the 
lack of protection from atmospheric moisture through the use of cloth 
bags as containers, the keeping qualities of the self -rising mixture are 
seriously impaired. 

Less baking powder is required for eake making than for biscuits, 
muffins, etc., — therefore self-rising flour would contain more baking 
powder than should be used in the making of cakes.

Cakes and Their Process 

The housewife who can serve to her family and guests dainty and 
rich cakes is the envy of her less fortunate sisters, and perhaps her near 
friend -will exclaim, "You always do have such luck with your cakes." 

Luck may enter into the work once in a while, and sometimes, too, 
a clever guess may be made as to the materials, but guesswork spells 
failure more often than success. 

Neither does the art of cake making consist in the possession of 
numerous recipes.. It depends upon certain fundamental rules and a 
certain knowledge of the application of heat. Some people grasp these 
things intuitively, while- others have to give more thought to the subject. 

For instance, eggs and their manipulation are one of the main 
stumbling blocks, although each detail of cake making is important. 
Eggs contain albumen, which begins to coagulate at about 134 degrees 
Fahr., while flour has to be subjected to a much greater heat in order 
to cook the starch. Therefore it will readily be understood that all cakes 
must rise to their full extent before browning over the top or applying 
heat enough to cook the flour. 

A quickly effervescing baking powder is also to be avoided in the 
making of cakes. If a quickly effervescing baking powder is used, it 
should be held back until the cake is ready for the pan, when it should 
be beaten in thoroughly and the batter immediately put into the pan 
for baking. More important still is the proportion of baking powder. 

Accuracy in measurement of all materials is absolutely necessary. 
Every kitchen should be provided with one or two of the glass or tin 
measuring cups and with them this accuracy can be obtained; Other 
tools necessary for cake making are the egg whip for the white of 
the egg and a rotary beater for the yolks, a wooden spoon with slotted 
bowl for the creaming of butter and sugar and mixing. The large size 
ordinary milk crock is superior to any other mixing bowl.. « 

For the baking of cakes the aluminum pans with the tubes are a 
little better than those without. Do not grease the sides of the cake pans. 
Grease the bottom and flour the sides and bottom. A paper is necessary 
for fruit loaf cakes or for any cake baked in a long sheet. Do not grease 
either paper or pan, unless the paper does not entirely cover the bottom 
of the pan. Then grease the uncovered bottom and corners. 

Prepare the pans first, then prepare and measure all the materials 
before beginning the mixing. The whites and yolks of the eggs should 
be beaten separately unless the recipe specifically directs otherwise. If 
the butter is cold and hard, warm the sugar slightly or add a couple of 
tablespoons of hot water to the sugar. Never melt the butter. Cream the 
butter and sugar thoroughly, until white and creamy.

In making measurements, level off the cup or spoon with a knife. 
The proper proportion of baking powder is one level teaspoon for each 
level cup of flour. Cakes are never as delicious made with bread flour 
as with winter wheat or pastry flour. All cake recipes presuppose that 
winter wheat flour is to be used. Therefore, if bread flour is used, the 
measurement must be one-fifth less as bread flour takes up more moisture, 
or substitute for one-third of the flour an equal amount of corn starch or 
rice starch. 

HIGH ALTITUDES — Almost all cake recipes are compounded for 
low altitude and the amount or proportion of flour depends on the alti- 
tude. For instance, a cake recipe calling for two and one-half cups of 
flour in ordinary altitudes would in Butte or Denver, or any point 
in the mountains, require three cups, about one-fifth, more flour. 

Do not use butter for greasing the pans, as there is the same objec- 
tion to it as in all other forms of cooking, it burns 4x>o easily. Use 
vegetable oil or lard. 

Begin the baking of cakes in a low oven. As soon as the cake batter 
has risen to its full extent, increase the heat and when well set and lightly 
browned, reduce the heat if not quite baked. 

The texture of a cake containing many eggs may be toughened by 
too hot an oven, just the same as a puff omelet is spoiled by over cooking. 

If sour milk is used, neutralize its acid with the smallest bit of soda 
and use about half as much baking powder as with sweet milk. 

If fruit or nuts sink to the bottom of the cake, it shows that the 
batter is too thin. 

An accurate unit of measure could not be established for unsifted 
flour, as its density differs. That is why we always say sift the flour 
once before measuring. Then add the baking powder and sift two or 
three times to insure the perfect mixing of the two materials. 

When cakes are properly mixed, the materials are in right propor- 
tion and an efficient baking powder is used, there is no danger of the 
usual activity around the house disturbing the cake or causing it to fall. 
"When many egg whites are required a few drops of lemon juice added 
to the whites when beaten foamy will be an advantage, as the acid has 
the property of keeping the air cells intact. This is particularly desir- 
able in the making of meringues. 

A cake is ready to take from the oven when it will spring back after 
a slight pressure of the finger. 

Cakes baked in shallow or layer cake pans require about one-fifth 
more flour than when baked in loaf pans. A corresponding proportion of 
baking powder should also be used. 

Before the advent of baking powder, cakes were made without 
leavening in some instances, such as fruit cakes and pound cakes, but 
the habit of the people is different from that of sixty years ago ; we now 

46 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 3 

Carbohydrates 

demand that bread and cake mixtures be leavened in order that the 
digestive process be not taxed by the use of heavy cakes and breads. 

It is therefore advisable to add baking powder and soda to some of 
the old fashioned fruit cake recipes. 

Use of soda should be restricted to the amount necessary to neutral- 
ize the acid of the milk or molasses. Too little carbon dioxide would be 
thus generated to leaven the amount of flomr used for such mixtures, 
therefore it is necessary to supply the carbon dioxide in the form of 
baking powder in the proportion of half a level teaspoon to each cup of 
flour, when soda is used with the acid of molasses or sour milk. 

Adjusting Oven : The tendency of many ovens is to accumulate too 
great heat in the upper part. It is sometimes necessary to place a 
shallow pan or kettle cover on the upper rack directly over the cake. 



The appearance while baking, is a guide to regulating the heat. 
The cake should look raw and bubbly over the top until just as high as it 
is going to be, then increase the heat slightly. The last ten minutes of 
baking, the heat is usually decreased.

Yeast Breads 

YEAST, Explanatory: 

In the development of yeast SUGAR is the SPUR. SALT the 
BRIDLE. 

Necessary conditions for the propagation of the yeast germ are 
warmth and moisture— product is C0 2 +C 2 H 8 0, carbon dioxid and 
alcohol. 

The yeast plant thrives on sugar and converted starch which is in the 
flour. As it developes the process produces carbon dioxid gas, alcohol and 
a lactic acid — later on another change produces acetic fermentation due 
to bacteria and known as souring. A tiny bit of soda may be used to 
overcome this tendency. But the formation of acetic acid must be re- 
garded as an accident due to carelessness. However, the tiny bit, of soda 
will do no harm. 

Diseases of Bread. Care must be taken to insure against the devel- 
opment of foreign bacteria and moulds by a sanitary cleanliness of ves- 
sels and coverings with which jloUghs are surrounded. The conditions 
which will spoil jellies and preserves and cause themto mold will pro- 
duce dangerous conditions in breads and flours. Such conditions are 
induced by dark and damD storage places. 

When once the bread utensils are infected only a thorough over- 
hauling will eradicate the fungus. 

The common disease from fungus growth develops first in the center 
of the loaf. The growth permeating the entire loaf, causing a stringy, 
pasty condition. 

COMPRESSED YEAST is skimmed from fermented rye and 
pressed. Each cake of compressed yeast is estimated to contain fifty 
billion yeast cells. Compressed yeast is frequently adulterated by the 
addition of starch or flour. 

Present day conditions make it unnecessary for the housewife to 
use home-made yeast as the compressed yeast is as rapid as the best home- 
made soft yeast, and far more dependable. 

The dry yeasts found in the market are scientifically prepared and 
as economical as those made at home. 

One of the frequent faults in bread making is the use of too much 
yeast. 

In making rolls, rusks or buns in which eggs and shortening are 
used, start the dough with a sponge. 

The grain will be finer and the bread whiter if well kneaded, due 
to the aeration or bringing in of oxygen to the dough. The sponge or 
dough should be set away in a warm (75 degrees Fahr.) moist place 
until leavened to double its bulk. 

In the absence of the proof-box as used by bakers for bread raising, 
a good substitute may be had in the oven of the gas range by placing 

51 



LESSON No. 4 , Domestic Science 

Carbohydrates * 

a disli of hot water. under the lower shelf or rack of the oven; the. oven 
is hot to be heated or lighted. A cupboard is very easily arranged with 
open or slatted shelves for this purpose where no gas range is in use. 

A great many housewives now make use of the fireless cookers for 
setting the sponge and dough to rise, but for pans of bread or rolls there 
is nothing quite equal to the proofing cupboard, as it insures against 
drafts and does away with the covering of the pans. 

A large crock or jar is to be preferred for the setting of sponges 
or doughs as the stoneware is not susceptible to varying temperature. 

If fresh mashed potatoes are not at hand or convenient, one-half 
cup flour, scalded, may be used. In either case the cooked starch supplies 
the proper food and conditions to promote the rapid development, of 
the yeast plant 

' Make this the basis of all yeast doughs, whether recipes call for it 
or not. Less yeast is required and a much better bread or roll is the 
result. 

Knead yeast dough until it is full Of small bubbles, discernible by 
blisters over the surface of the dough. 

Set to rise in warm steamy atmosphere until doubled in bulk. Roll 
\ dough should not be mixed as stiff as bread dough 

Sponges must not be allowed to stand too long. 

I The sponge is ready to mix when bubbles gather on the surface and 
| break occasionally*

Salt-Rising Bread 

Explanatory; The leavening for salt-rising bread is established by 
a process of fermentation which is set up in the flour and water or flour 
and milk. . Bacteria plays an important part in this process, and the 
yeast plants of the air or wild yeast find the batter a good medium for 
development. 

It has been established, too, that in a surgically clean room it is 
almost impossible to produce the necessary ferment. The same batter 
placed in a room far from clean will foam up in' a short time. 

Salt-rising bread requires more heat while in the process of fermen- 
tation and a much longer time to bake than yeast breads. 

Method : Stir two tablespoons of corn meal into a half pint of water 
that has been heated to 130 degrees Fahr. Add one-half teaspoon of salt 
and mix well. Make this in a tall pitcher ; cover with a dish and surround 
with water at about 160 degrees Pahr. Keep over night in a warm place. 

Then warm one quart of milk and to it add one teaspoon of salt and 
sufficient warm flour to make a heavy batter. Add the emptyings and 
beat five minutes. Cover and stand in a warm place for about two 
hours. Then add flour to make a very, soft dough. Knead till smooth 
and elastic. Divide into four loaves. Place each in individual loaf pan ; 
cover with a towel; keep in warm place. When light bake one hour in

Lesson Number Five 



Proteins 

Milk 

Milk contains all of the food principles but they are not in the right 
proportion to make it a perfect food for an adult. 

Skim milk is whole milk from which the fat has been removed. It 
may usually be bought for half the price of whole milk. 

Buttermilk is the milk left after the butter fat has been removed 
from the cream by churning. Commercial buttermilk is made by adding 
certain lactic acid bacteria to whole or skimmed milk. 

Certified milk is milk which is certified to be pure, clean milk, to 
contain comparatively few bacteria and none of these to be disease pro- 
ducing. Certified milk sells for about twice as much as ordinary milk. 

Pasteurized milk is milk heated in a sterile container to 165 degrees 
Fahr. for 15 minutes or to a little lower temperature for a longer time. 

Scalded milk is milk heated in a double boiler until bubbles appear 
around the edge, about 185 degrees Fahr. 

Eggs 

Eggs are a protein food. Usually they are easily and thoroughly 
digested. For this reason eggs are often prescribed for those who need 
nourishing foods. 

Eggs lack carbohydrate, so we eat them with toast, rice or potatoes. 
They are rich in mineral salts. 

Eggs are much more easily digested when cooked at a low temper- 
ature, 160 to 180 degrees Fahr. 

Keep eggs in a cool, dry place. The shell is very porous and water 
evaporates through it easily; air rushes in to take its place and causes 
decomposition of the egg. 

On account of its lack of flavor, a raw egg does not cause the diges- 
tive juices to flow and is not very easily digested. 

A soft cooked egg digests very quickly. 

A medium cooked egg is harder to digest than a raw, soft cooked or 
hard cooked egg. A hard cooked egg, when cooked at a proper tempera- 
ture, is mealy and about as easily digested as a soft cooked egg. 

Boiled Eggs 

Method No. 1 : Place eggs in a quantity of cold water ; put over the 
fire and allow to come to a boil. If soft egg is desired, remove at once. 
If the white is desired well cooked, with yolk soft, allow to stand in 
boiling water one-half minute. 

55 



LESSON No. 5 Domestic Science 

Proteins 

' Method No. 2 : Place eggs in rapidly boiling water, two quarts at 
least; remove from fire and allow eggs to remain uncovered from eight 
to ten minutes, time depending on how much cooking is desired. 

Method No. 3: Place eggs in rapidly boiling water, allowing to 
continue boiling. For soft cooked eggs remove promptly at three and a 
half minutes. 

The four-minute egg insures no uncooked white around the yolk. 

This method, however, is the least desirable. If eggs are overlooked 
for a moment too long, drop them into cold running water and the 
cooking will be arrested. 

Explanatory: The albumen of egg coagulates or cooks at 130 de- 
grees Fahr. Water boils at 212 degrees Fahr. ; hence eggs cooked too 
rapidly or exposed to too great heat are rendered tough and indigestible. 

BUTTERMILK is of about the same food value as milk and has 
important dietetic qualities, containing lactic acid. Buttermilk can be 
retained and digested by invalids or persons suffering from stomach 
trouble when fresh milk is rejected, as fresh milk will form a curd or 
cheese in the stomach when taken down in quantities. To avoid dis- 
tress and receive most benefit as a food, milk should be taken by the 
spoon. Physicians who make a specialty of children's dietary sometimes 
prescribe a modified buttermilk to the exclusion of fresh milk. 

For Infant Feeding: Explanatory: The use of buttermilk pur- 
chased from dairies seems distasteful to many where certified regulations 
are not in operation, and there are occasions when it is impossible to 
secure any supply of buttermilk. To provide against such contingency, 
lacto tablets can be purchased at the druggist's with instructions for con- 
verting sweet skim milk into buttermilk. For infant feeding it is desir- 
able to eliminate the butter-fat. 

The source of buttermilk does not alter the necessity for churning 
it in a small churn, as the casein must be broken or separated. In the 
absence of the churn a good rotary egg beater may be used. It is best 
to get a small churn and churn the milk soured at home, as in that way 
you are sure of its freshness and cleanliness. 

Method : The first formula or basis is : 

1 tablespoon flour put in oven until it is a golden brown, which 
turns the starch to dextrin. 

1 tablespoon granulated sugar,, 

1 quart buttermilk. 

PASTEURIZATION: 

Cook the buttermilk directly over the fire, stirring constantly to pre- 
vent it curdling. Make a paste of the browned flour and sugar and stir 
into the hot buttermilk and boil from five to ten minutes, still stirring. 

Fried Eggs 

For two eggs select a skillet not larger than a tea saucer. 
Heat the skillet and place drippings or butter in it 

56 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 5 

Proteins 

Break the eggs into a saucer and slip into the skillet. Season with 
salt and pepper and cover. Do not have too much heat under the 
skillet. 

Poached Eggs 

Have water in a skillet salted and heated to just Doiling point. Break 
the eggs into a dish and then slip them into the water, moving the 
pan where the water wilb remain hot but not boil. This method will 
produce an egg of jelly-like consistency. 

A muffin ring may first be placed in the water, one for each egg, or 
the aluminum egg poachers may be used. They are very convenient 
and practical. 

Puff Omelet 

4 eggs 1 tablespoon butter or oleomas 

4 tablespoons warm water garine 

Salt and pepper to season Skillet eight or nine inches in 

diameter for this quantity 

Preparation: Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks until stiff and 
lemon colored. 

"Whip the white very stiff. Add seasoning and water to the yolks. 
Add the whites and pour into the pan in which the tablespoon of butter 
has been melted. 

Place pan over the fire until well set around the edges. Then remove 
to oven or place under broiler until top is dry and center cooked. This 
takes but a few minutes, and care must be taken not to overcook, as too 
much heat will cause the omelet to shrink. 

Holding pan in the left hand, fold over away from the handle of 
the pan and turn onto a warm platter. Sprinkle with parsley and serve. 

Custard (Cooking School) 

2 cups milk 4 tablespoons sugar 

1 tablespoon flour 3 egg yolks 
Nutmeg 2 egg whites 

2 teaspoons sugar 2 tablespoons cold water 

Preparation: Place the milk in double boiler. Mix the flour and 
sugar. Separate eggs; beat the yolks with two tablespoons cold water. 

Add the mixed flour and sugar to the hot milk ; allow to cook a few 
moments, then add the egg yolks. 

If flavoring is desired, add a few drops. 

As soon as the custard coats the spoon it is time to remove it from 
the hot water. 

When ready to serve the custard, beat the whites of the eggs stiff, 
add the two teaspoons of sugar. Prepare a dish of water which is hot 
enough to give off steam but not boiling rapidly. Drop spoonfuls of 
the meringue into this water; when glossed over and cooked take up (

each meringue and place on top of the custard and sprinkle with nut- 
meg. Be careful that the meringues are not overcooked or they will 
coagulate and fall.

Cheese 



Cheese has nearly double the amount of protein (muscle builder), 
weight for weight, that beef has and should be placed in the regular 
dietary as a staple rather than as an auxiliary food. 

SKIM MILK CHEESE is about 1/3 protein, 1/3 fat and 1/3 water. 

EICH CREAM CHEESE has a larger percent of both fat and pro- 
tein than steak, eggs, milk or bread. 



The harder breads and crackers are recommended as proper com- 
plement to induce mastication. 

Cheese dishes require the green vegetable with rice, potatoes or 
Italian paste to balance the meal, with fruits as a dessert. 



Cottage Cheese 

(Schmierkase) 

Pour as much boiling water into the thick sour milk as you have milk, 
stirring as it is poured. Let it stand five minutes, then pour into a drain 
bag. If only a small quantity is being made, put a square of cheese cloth 
into a strainer and pour in the curds and whey. "When drained, gather 
up the edges of the cheese cloth, tie with a cord and allow to hane over 
night. 

Kase Kuchen 
(Cheese Pie) 

3 eggs 1 heaping teaspoon flour, or 
Grated rind and juice of 1 bread crumbs 

lemon 2 cups cheese 
1 cup sugar 

Preparation : Mix the sugar and flour, reserve two egg whites, beat 
up the remaining egg white and the yolks, then put all of the 
materials together into the double cooker. This can be turned into the 
uncooked pastry shell and baked until the pastry is cooked and the filling 
set. The reserved whites of the eggs may be beaten with two tablespoons 
sugar and used as a meringue.

Lesson Number Seven 



Proteins 

Fish 

Fish belongs to the group of foods rich in protein or nitrogenous 
matter. 

The muscle building matter in fish, such as white fish, cod, haddock 
and halibut, is about the same as in beef or mutton. Phosphates are more 
abundant in fish than in meats ; there is also much more waste and the 
edible portion contains more water. Dark fleshed fish, as salmon, catfish, 
sturgeon and tuna, have the fat distributed through the body, and while 
more difficult of digestion, furnish more food value than the white fleshed 
fish — cod, haddock, etc. 

HOW TO SELECT FISH: Fish to be eatable must be fresh from 
the water or handled carefully in cold storage. Stale fish is a dangerous 
food. Fresh fish have bright scales and eyes, with gills that are pink. 
The flesh must be firm and free from unpleasant odor. 

Beware of the fish markets where channel cat and horned pout are 
to be found skinned, soaking in water and ice. To use a simile — how 
much egg albumen would you have remaining were you to break an egg 
into a quantity of water? — the albumen or protein would be dissipated 
or dispersed in the water. The same effect would be produced on the 
soluble proteins by soaking lean meat or fish in an abundance of water. 

HOW TO PREPARE FISH: Fish that have been out of the 
water long and dried over should be dipped in water a moment to loosen 
the scales. 

Make an incision on each side and the length of the fins, deep enough 
to draw the fins entirely out, leaving no small bones to embarrass the 
diner. Many fish like white fish, blue fish, pike, pickerel and Lake Supe- 
rior trout have a layer of blubber or fat and a row of small bones that 
extend from the back fin to the head. In making the incision beside 
the fin, extend it to the head and remove the fat and the bones. In 
cooking some of the smaller fish, especially when broiling, the head 
and tail are not removed. In that case make the incision beside each fin, 
but do not draw out. Catfish, horned pout and fish without scales are 
often skinned. This is not necessary if the fish are dipped in very warm 
water and then scraped and scrubbed. 

HOW TO COOK FISH : It is well to bear in mind that the flesh 
of fish is largely composed of the same ingredients as meat, though in 
different proportions. Too much heat or too prolonged cooking render 
it tough and unpalatable. Fish require much the same methods in pre- 
paration as meat. The structure, however, is much more delicate and so 
also is the flavor. The flavor of fish is often destroyed by unskillful meth- 
ods in cooking and serving. 

61 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 7 

Proteins 

TO STEAM FISH is better than to boil it. 

TO BRAISE FRESH FISH that is sold in slices, such as salmon, 
halibut, cod, etc., is much the better method of cooking; it conserves the 
nutriment and improves the flavor, and with certain accompaniments 
and seasoning is a tasty method Of serving. To braise fish slices, sur- 
round them in a shallow casserole or sauce pan with a little sliced or 
canned tomato, sliced onion, green or red pepper, with a sprinkle of 
bread crumbs and seasoning of salt and pepper. Finish, if desired, with 
a few slices of bacon laid over the top. Time required, about thirty 
minutes. 

TO FRY FISH: For family service would advise frying fish in 
shallow fat or oil in a skillet requiring only a few tablespoons, rather 
than in the kettle of deep fat or oil 

Fish slices and all skinned fish, such as channel cat, blue cat, horned 
pout and eels, should all be dipped in beaten egg or batter, then in 
bread crumbs or flour. When the fish is brown on both sides cover, reduce 
the heat and allow to finish slowly. Season while cooking. 

The fresh water fish, such as lake trout and those belonging to the 
white fish family, as blue fish, cat, pike, crappy, bass and sun fish, are 
the choice fish to select for frying. However, the three latter are very 
choice fish to broil. 

TO BROIL : Broiling is a popular method of cooking sun fish, blue 
gill, all varieties of the bass family, perch, pike and similar fish, and 
requires the same preparation as for frying. Instead of the skillet, pre- 
pare the broiler, having it heated for three to five minutes before placing 
the fish on it. Do not have the heat as great as for meat. When browned 
on both sides, reduce the heat and finish slowly. Season while cooking. 

BAKING FISH requires the same preparation, except that the fins 
are not generally removed, but the incisions are made, enabling a less 
difiScult service. 

STUFFING for BAKED FISH is ordinarily a combination of bread 
crumbs, mashed potato, with a seasoning of onions or garlic, green pep- 
per, salt and white pepper. The bread crumbs may be moistened with 
a few spoonsful of tomato juice instead of water. 

PLANKED FISH service is suitable for any fish weighing three 
pounds or over. 

After the housewife has once mastered the planking of a fish it will 
be found a more agreeable method than frying, as it requires less 
attention just when there are so many details of the dinner calling for 
quick attention. 

Fish for planking are usually shad, white fish, blue fish, pike, Lake 
Superior trout, and the larger of the cat family, of which the channel 
eat is the choicest variety. The blue cat follows. 

62 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 7 

Proteins 

To prepare for planking, split the fish and remove all of the bones, 
after having prepared according to instructions for frying. The cat fish 
may be prepared as previously instructed. 

For family use the heavy white ironstone china platter may be used 
instead of the plank. 

The fish plank is an oval-shaped board about one inch thick, made 
from dry-kilned birch or other suitable wood. A deep groove follows 
the edge. The plank is heated as hot as can be without scorching. The 
fish, laid open, is placed skin side down. If the fish under preparation 
is not a fat fish, baste with a little melted butter, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Place under the broiler fire or on the top shelf of a coal range 
oven. After the surface is slightly browned, reduce the heat. A four- 
pound fish requires about thirty minutes. 

For the most efficient method of planking, the writer recommends 
the heavy platter of ironstone china or white enameled ware, as it fur- 
nishes the dish on which to serve the fish, keeping it and the accompany- 
ing potatoes warm throughout the dinner. 

To plank fish on a platter, proceed as with plank of wood. Heat the 
platter quite hot, placing the fish skin side down. Neither platter nor 
plank require greasing. 

GRATED CHEESE makes a nice garnish for planked fish if 
sprinkled over the fish about five minutes before removing from the fire. 

POTATO ROSES, SARATOGA POTATOES or RICED POTA- 
TOES may be used as a border around the fish when ready to serve. 



Fish Chowder 

FISH CHOWDER is a way of serving fish free from bones. 

Method: Place half a pound of salt pork, diced, in a deep skillet. 
Allow to fry out. Slice one onion into the fat and simmer while prepar- 
ing half a dozen small potatoes by peeling and dicing. Drop them into 
the fat and stir around until ready to brown over. Then place two pounds 
of flaked and boned fish on the surface of the potatoes ; cover and allow 
to simmer until potatoes are tender, when fish will be found cooked. 
Season with salt and pepper ; add about three-quarters of a cup of rich 
milk and allow to come to boil. 

GREEN or RED PEPPER, cut up with the onion, will improve the 
dish. 

FISH CHOWDER, served as a soup, must have quantities of water 
or milk, with requisite seasoning added to the chowder. 

FISH SAUCES are very simple, usually a combination of butter, 
water, flour and lemon juice, with a variety of seasonings.

LESSON No. 7 Domestic Science 



Fish Accompaniments 

Baked salmon is considered one of the most elegant of dinner fish 
and is rich enough in itself to furnish the heavy course. 

Care must be exercised to serve appropriate dishes with it, such as 
entrees, sauces, vegetables and desserts, to make the dinner complete. 

Contrary to a heavy meat dinner, a rich dessert is desirable with a 
fish dinner. 

The entrees, however, must not be sweet. 

Certain vegetables associate themselves with a fish course. 

A baked salmon brought to the table with one-half of the platter 
banked with fresh, crisp watercress is a feast for the epicurean eye, as 
well as for the palate. The cress not only garnishes the dishjbut sprigs 
of it should be served with the dish. 

"Water cress, lending a zest to many dishes, is particularly appropri- 
ate with salmon. 

The entrees that can be served are many, including stuffed green 
peppers, French or cream pea patties, celery or macaroni croquettes, 
various vegetables au gratin with cheese, combinations of egg, mush- 
rooms in many forms and the Italian pastes. 

The sauces are not so many but more important, as no fish is ever 
served without a sauce. 

Baked salmon requires one of the following sauces: Lemon butter 
sauce, sauce Bechamel, sauce Genoise, Hollandaise, sauce Tartare, an- 
chovy butter, Spanish Bernaise, piquant or horse-radish sauce. 

The principal vegetables to accompany a fish dinner are peas, string 
or butter beans, cauliflower, artichokes, fried green peppers or fried 
green tomatoes with Irish potatoes in some form. 

Salads of cucumbers lead, with combination, tomato, cold slaw, pea 
and cheese salads following. 

Very finely shredded cabbage with green peppers is good. 

The dessert usually takes the form of a rich pastry, such as lemon, 
orange, rhubarb or pineapple pie. 

Puddings are not acceptable with a fish dinner. 

Fish not so rich as salmon are cooked with a larding of bacon or 
salt pork, or a sprinkle of cheese. The larding is accomplished by cutting 
gashes in the fish and laying in long slices of pork or bacon. 

The soup to precede the fish is never of a meat stock, or boullion. 
It is usually a cream of some vegetable or fish, more often of a vegetable. 

The preferred stuffing for a fish is of bread with plenty of onion and 
green peppers minced fine. 

Grated cheese sprinkled over a baking fish about fifteen minutes be- 
fore removing from the oven is a great addition, giving a piquancy much 
desired.

Lesson Number Eight

PROTEIN AS FOUND IN MEAT: With meat prices soaring, 
the thrifty housewife looks about for new ways to serve cheaper cuts. 
This is well, for the cheaper cuts, be it known, are as rich in nutri- 
tive value as the expensive cuts. The housewife among the poorer 
classes of other countries seems to come naturally by the principles of 
the conservation of the full value of food products, just as the earnest 
thinking women of this country are coming to realize the significance 
of this problem. 

Although a common article of diet, little is known about the selec- 
tion, cooking and nutritive value of the different cuts of meat. 

As a rule, round steak is cut too thin, thereby losing much of the 
juice contained in it. 

Lean of meat supplies a valuable form of protein or muscle build- 
ing. 

The structure of meat should be well understood in order to make 
clear the science of properly conserving the protein and gaining full 
food value for expenditure, and full flavor to make the dish palatable 
and tasty. 

The protein is found in large proportion in the muscular part of the 
animal. As a rule, meat must be cut across the grain or muscle. This 
peculiarity of structure makes the loss of protein more rapid if the meat 
is not carefully seared to prevent its loss. 

A gentle heat is necessary to break down and soften the tissue, but 
the searing process must first be performed, then the heat reduced until 
cooking is finished. This is an inexorable rule to be followed, except 
when making beef tea or soups. 

Meat intended for BEEF TEA and SOUPS requires just the oppo- 
site treatment to extract the juice. 

The protein of meat is similar in its property to the white of egg, 
and when subjected to intense heat coagulates or hardens, making it indi- 
gestible as well as unpalatable. This coagulation begins at about 130 de- 
grees Fahr., therefore, in stewing or cooking meat in water, learn to 
maintain the cooking below the boiling or bubbling point of water, which 
in this altitude is 212 degrees. 

Meat should be simmered not boiled. 

To the housewife who uses a gas range, the use of the small simmer- 
ing burner for that purpose, with the flame turned low, is recommended. 
For the owner of a wood or coal range, it is a very easy matter to keep 
the kettle at the right point of heat on the back of the range. 

65 



LESSON No. 8 Domestic Science 

Proteins 

To prepare a POT EOAST, the cook formerly put the meat into a 
kettle of hot drippings, turning constantly until seared entirely over 
the surface. The principle was right, but not everyone cares to stand 
over the sputtering grease. A little easier way is to place meat in a ves- 
sel and pour over it boiling water in which a large spoonful of salt has 
boiled, as this increases the heat of the water. 

BOILING SALTED WATER will have a greater heat than boiling 
unsalted water. 

OVEN ROASTS may be treated in the same way, then placed in 
hot oven for twenty minutes, later reducing heat and allowing to cook 
at the lower temperature. 



Hungarian Goulash (Gulyas) 

(A choice dish of mutton) 

2 pounds mutton (cheaper cuts) 3 medium potatoes 

2 medium onions 1 green pepper 

% cup drippings or margarine 1 cup rich milk or evaporated 
Salt and paprika to season milk reduced slightly 

Parsley to garnish 

* Preparation : Place the drippings in a deep stew kettle, al umin um 
preferred ; slice the onions and green pepper into it and cook briskly for 
ten minutes. Then cut the meat into pieces about the size of an egg and 
cook until well seared over, about fifteen minutes. 

Add half a cup of hot water ; cover and cook until tender over sim- 
mering burner or low fire, adding water in small quantities as necessary. 

When meat is tender, place the potatoes, which have been diced, on 
top of the meat ; cover again and steam until tender, but not too soft. 

Then add the milk, salt and a genero is seasoning of the paprika. 
Serve garnished with minced parsley. 

The main point to remember is to keep barely enough water on the 
meat so when finally the milk is added there is no water remaining. That 
is the secret of the choice flavor. 

Beef or veal may be used, taking the cheaper cuts. But the Hun- 
garians use mutton in making this dish, for which they are famous. 

Mexican Round Steak 

Select a thick steak and hack with a sharp knife, working in all the 
flour possible. Put into hot skillet with half cup of drippings, turning 
until well seared. Pour over it one cup of water and a covering of 
tomatoes, a couple of medium onions minced fine, with a minced green 
pepper. Cook for about one hour. Season with salt and pepper; cover 
with a liberal grating of cheese and slightly brown. This method con- 
serves all of the meat juices and provides a delicious gravy.

Proper Method of Broiling a Steak 

(Under Gas Broiler) 

Order your steak two inches thick. 

Heat the broiler by lighting the burner five minutes before putting 
the steak on the rack. Prepare the steak by cutting away all superfluous 
fat, which has a tendency to scorch and fill the pan with drippings that in 
turn may catch fire. 

Place the steak as close to the flame as possible and sear over quickly, 
turning two or three times during the first eight or ten minutes, then 
reduce the heat and place the steak a little further away from the flame. 

In turning the steak be careful not to pierce the lean part of the 
meat with the fork, as that will release the juice and make the meat drier. 

Steak two inches thick requires about 30 minutes. 

Steak an inch thick requires from 8-15 minutes to broil. Do not 
hurry the process after the first seven or eight minutes, unless your 
steak is very thin, in which case it will be finished in that time. 

When the steak to be broiled is not large enough to cover a consider- 
able part of the broiler, it is a good plan to place a shallow biscuit or 
pie pan directly under the rack where the meat is placed, in this way 
retaining the juice and drippings in one place and lessening the liability 
of the drippings catching fire, at the same time conserving the juices 
for serving with the steak. 

Do not attempt to broil a round steak. Its texture is such that the 
heat draws out the juice before it is seared. The steaks to broil are: 
sirloin, tenderloin, porterhouse and club. 

From an exceptionally prime beef a nice two inch thick cut from 
either the shoulder or chuck or from the rump is suitable for broiling. 

TO BOIL A HAM; Whether or not a ham should be soaked over 
night is simply a matter of taste. Saltpetre is not as much used as for- 
merly in preserving ham and the soaking over night may now be dis- 
pensed with. 

Cleanse the ham properly, then pour over it a gallon or so of boiling 
water. Cover and place over simmering burner of the gas range or on the 
back of the wood or coal, range and cook until tender without allowing to 
boil at a gallop. 

The ham, or any other meat can cook at a temperature of 175 de- 
grees Fahr. 

If a fireless cooker is convenient, allow the kettle to remain on the 
fire fifteen minutes before placing in the cooker. If hot radiators are 
part of the cooker equipment, the fifteen minutes on the range are not 
necessary.

LESSON No. 8 Domestic Science 

Proteins 

TO ROAST A HAM : Remove it from the fireless cooker, place in a 
roaster or dripping pan ; take off all the skin and surplus fat ; cover with 
fine bread crumbs, sprinkle with brown, sugar, cinnamon and spices, and 
stick cloves over the surface. Place in a moderate oven. about thirty, to 
forty-five minutes. 

Cider Sauce 
(To serve with Baked Ham) 

1 pint cider 3 tablespoons flour 

1 tablespoon capers ^ teaspoon curry powder 
3 tablespoons ham fat from kettle 1 teaspoon whole allspice 

% cup chopped gherkins 

Preparation: Place the ham fat in the skillet; add curry powder; 
allow to heat thoroughly. Then add the flour, following it with the hot 
cider and allspice. Cook until creamy. 

In the absence of cider, hot water to which three tablespoons of 
vinegar and two finely grated apples have been added, may be substi- 

Meat Loaf 

1 pound uncooked beef 1 cup milk 

1 pound uncooked mutton 2 eggs 

3 cups bread crumbs Seasoning to taste, add onions 

' 1 pound fresh lean pork or garlic, if desired 

Preparation: Put the meats through the food chopper, mix with 
the other materials, beating the eggs slightly. 

Bake thirty minutes in moderate oven. 

Care should be taken not to overcook meat loaf as it makes it dry. 

The most acceptable seasoning is a combination of sage, marjoram, 
sweet basil, thyme and summer savory.

Preparation : Trim meat free from fat and gristle ; cut into cubes 
size of an egg ; roll them in flour. Place a stew pan over the fire and put 
into it the drippings and onion and when hot turn in the meat and 
brown, then the tomatoes and sliced pimientoes and cook until meat is 
tender. Make a border of the cooked rice or spaghetti either on a chop 
plate or platter. Serve the chili con carne in this border. Garnish by 
placing half slices of lemon and rings of pimientoes, alternately, aroundj 
the border of rice.

Mutton Curry 

3 cups of mutton from the neck 2 medium onions, minced 

cut into inch cubes 1 quart boiling water 

1 stalk celery 2 sprigs mint 

Minced parsley 3 tablespoons each margarine and 

1 teaspoon curry powder flour 

Boiled rice Salt and pepper 

Preparation : Put the meat over a gentle fire to stew or simmer in 
the quart of water. When almost tender add the minced onion and half 
a dozen leaves of the mint. Remove when tender and strain the liquor. 

Melt the margarine, add the curry powder, let saute about three 
minutes ; add the flour and the strained liquor, then the seasoning. 

Cook until creamy, pour it over the meat or add the meat to it. 
Serve either in a border or around a mound of cooked rice. The mound 
is much to be preferred, as in this way the rice does not chill and the meat 
and curry sauce is poured around it. Sprinkle over all the remaining 
minced mint and the minced parsley 

Braised Soup Meat 

Select some of the cheaper cuts of meat with the bone included ; for 
instance, rib end of beef or oxtail. 

The soup meat, if properly treated for soup making, is at its best 
rather tasteless for hashes, etc. 

Try this method of braising the soup meat and serve at the same 
meal at which the soup is served. 

Half an hour before dinner take the pieces of meat from the kettle, 
drain, roll in cracker meal, which has been seasoned with salt, paprika 
and pepper, place in a small dripping pan, surround with half a can of 
tomatoes, a small onion sliced and a green pepper minced. Place in a 
hot oven, basting frequently. To make the dinner complete, serve baked 
potatoes. The meat left over can be used for hash or meat pie, and has 
a good flavor. 

Soup Stock of Fresh Meat 

There is no economy in mere bones for soup stock. Select meaty 
bones. Cover with cold water, and allow to stand half an hour or so. 

Put over a slow fire or the simmering burner and by no means 
permit the kettle to borl. A tireless cooker with the heated radiator is a 
sure method of getting proper results. 

If beef is used, half a day is none too long for cooking. Veal, mutton 
or oxtail requires less time. 

When all the flavor is extracted from the meat, strain and season 
as desired.

Soup Stock of Left Overs 

The wise housewife has a stock kettle. Into this go the clean scraps, 
bones and trimmings, the broken-up carcass of roast fowl and the bones 
left on the platter after serving broiled steak. 

Exceeding care must be taken to have these materials at once 
covered with cold water and brought nearly to the boiling point and 
allowed to simmer till no more eood remains. 

Salt and perhaps the herb seasoning may be added while simmering 
this, but do not attempt to add onion or vegetable seasoning unless to 
serve at once as the vegetable flavors being volatile are lost or deterior- 
ated by standing. 



Veal Soup Piquant 

2 quarts veal stock i tablespoon flour (heaping) 

2 cups diced cold veal 1 tablespoon margarine (heaping) 

1 lemon, seasoning of salt and Sprig of sweet basil 
paprika 

Preparation : Season the stock with the salt and sweet basil, pour 
over the creamed margarine and flour. Boil up. Cut the lemon in thin 
slices, place in the tureen and pour over it the stock. Serve at once. 

TO PREPARE A LARGE FOWL or TURKEY for ROASTING: 

When the fowl is trussed and dressed ready for the roasting pan, sear 
well. Then place in the roaster in hot oven for about ten minutes. 
After that cover and reduce the heat. 

TO PREPARE FOWL for DRESSING : It should be split down the 
back, opened up and all of the viscera removed without making the other 
openings. When prepared and cleaned, place breast side down and fill 
with the dressing. Have ready some short steel skewers, such as the 
butcher provides, and a length of wrapping twine. Put the skewers 
through the edges of the back, take the center of the twine and, begin- 
ning at the neck, lace the twine around the skewers. This method will 
be found much superior to the old way of closing the openings with a 
darning needle and twine.

Vegetables 

Explanatory: Vegetables as a rule should be cooked in uncovered 



RICE and MACARONI should be cooked in rapidly boiling water, 
not that they will cook more quickly, but the action of the water separates 
the particles. 

All vegetables should go over the fire in boiling water. To green 
vegetables add a pinch of salt. 

ROOTS and TUBERS are better cooked in unsalted water as the 
cellulose or woody fiber is toughened by the salt. 

It is well known that vegetables containing protein, as PEAS, 
LENTILS and BEANS, are not so readily softened in hard water, so 
a pinch of bicarbonate of soda is added to soften the water and soak 
the vegetables more quickly. Do not add soda to green vegetables. 

If green vegetables become wilted, restore them by placing in cold 
water. Salt water tends to toughen the cellulose.' 

Vegetables with a strong odor, such as cabbage, onions and cauli- 
flower should be cooked in boiling water, uncovered. 



Classification of Vegetables

the skin. Therefore pare very thin and put the potatoes in boiling 
water to cook. If a seasoning ofjsalt is desired, add salt ten minutes 
before potatoes are tender., 

In ordinary altitudes potatoes require from twenty-five to thirty- 
five minutes to boil, but in the higher altitudes more time is required on 
account of rapid evaporation. 



Mashed Potatoes 

6 potatoes 2 tablespoons butter 

1 tablespoon salt Hot milk to cream 

Preparation : Pare and put potatoes over to cook in boiling water. 
When tender drain them carefully. Put one cup of milk to. scald. 
Add butter and salt to the potatoes and mash with wire potato masher. 
Add boiling milk, a little at a time until the potatoes have taken up all 
they will absorb. Serve in hot tureen. Sprinkle with minced parsley. 



Riced Potatoes 

This is an excellent variation from plain boiled or from mashed 
potatoes. Cook same as for mashed potatoes. When ready dip the 
ricer in boiling water, fill with potatoes and press through ricer into 
hot tureen, shake seasoning of salt and pepper over them, dot with 
bits of butter and serve hot. Very nice when pressed directly into 
individual side dishes or shallow ramekins which have been heated. 



Potatoes O'Brien 

Dice carefully six medium cold boiled potatoes in half inch cubes: 
Dredge very lightly with flour, season with salt and pepper and let stantj. 
while mincing two green bell peppers, and one small onion. Put three 
tablespoons of oil or drippings into a frying pan, throw in the minced 
onion and peppers, saute, but do not brown. Then put in the potatoes 
and allow to cook through. 

Turn onto a hot platter in a mound and sprinkle with finely minced 
parsley. In using green peppers always discard the seeds.

Rice 

Explanatory : In rice producing countries rice is used in the daily 
foods as we use Irish Potatoes, and "Wheat Breads. It is eaten alone 
or with a little dried fish, other foods to balance the ration. In China, 
Japan and Java, Soy-bean sauce or Soy-bean Cheese or similar products 
are eaten with rice, and supply the necessary complement of protein 
in the daily diet. 

Rice is valuable as a starchy food, but in boiling parts with a con- 
siderable per cent of both starch and mineral matter, therefore, the 
water in which rice is cooked, holds food value, and if rice is cooked in 
more water that can be absorbed, the remaining liquor or water should 
be retained for soups or gravies. 

For nutritive purposes we would recommend the cooking of rice in 
just sufficient water to be absorbed, i. e., four times as much water as 
measure of rice. 

EFFECT OF POLISHING RICE: Farmers' Bulletin No. 417 
has this to say, " Using the grain without polishing is economical and 
furnishes a rice of much higher food value. In the process of polishing 
nearly all fats are removed." We are to understand from that, that 
the unpolished rice is the more wholesome and nutritive. 

Boiled Rice, No. 1 

1 cup unpolished rice 4 caps boiling water 

1 teaspoon salt * 1 teaspoon butter 

Preparation : Place boiling water in the upper kettle of rice boiler, 
with salt and butter, add the cleaned rice and keep rapidly boiling for 
fifteen to twenty minutes. When the rice has absorbed most of the 
water this kettle can be set into the water vessel and allowed to complete 
the cooking uncovered in the double boiler. 

If an ordinary sauce pan is used instead of the double cooker, an 
asbestos mat may be placed under the kettle to complete the cooking. 

Boiled Rice, No. 2 

% cup rice 4 cup* boiling water 

1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon butter 

Preparation : Put the water into a much larger kettle than is neces- 
sary for amount of materials. Add the salt and butter, and when boiling 
sprinkle in the cleaned rice. Boil at a gallop thirty minutes. Pour into 
a strainer or sieve, dash a cup of clear water oyer the rice and set in 
a warm oven to dry. The water in which the rice was cooked may be 
preserved for soups or broth.

Spanish Rice 

Rice Oil or butter 

Salt Clear stock or water 

Preparation : Place sauce pan over fire with a level tablespoon of 
oil or butter. Sprinkle into it the cleaned uncooked rice and cook 
over a low flame for five minutes. Add a dash of salt and the stock and 
cook twenty minutes briskly. 

Note: If onions, curry powder or green peppers are to be a part 
of this dish, they are first sauted in the oil and then rice is added. 



Italian Pastes 

VEGETABLES, Starchy and Italian Pastes 

MACARONI, Explanatory: Macaroni or any of the Italian pastes 
with cheese or with cream sauce should be served in place of a meat 
dish instead of with a meat dish. 

Such a dish contains sufficient nutriment to make a complete ration 
served with a green vegetable or salad. 

A few years ago the best grades were imported but it is now con- 
ceded that American made pastes of standard brands excel all others 
in food value and sanitary manufacture. 

The pastes intended for cooking in soups are first dropped into 
boiling salted water for twenty minutes and boiled rapidly, using a 
large quantity of water. The pastes are then drained and put into 
soup kettle with the soup to finish. For all other dishes the pastes must 
be dropped into salted boiling water and cooked at a rapid boil thirty 
minutes. Then put into a collander and cold water run through to 
blanche and separate. 

EGG NOODLES (Manufactured) : The manufactured egg noodles 
are treated the same as Macaroni and Spaghetti and if made by a reliable 
firm will be found to be a trifle richer in nutrition than the other pastes 
as egg enter into their manufacture. The egg noodles are perhaps a 
nicer addition to soups than any of the other pastes. The best of the 
manufactured noodles are superior to those made at home and make a 
better appearing dish. 

Hominy 

HOMINY, Explanatory : We have two sorts of Hominy, one almost 
the entire grain with the hull taken off, the other the grain ground after 
the hull has been removed. The latter is known as hominy grits. Both 
kinds should be soaked in cold water over night, then cooked slowly. 
The markets supply the soaked hominy. 

Dried hominy doubles in bulk when soaked.

Domestic Science LESSON No. 11 

Carbohydrates. 

To Cook Dry Hominy 

1 cup dry hominy V2 teaspoon salt 

1 quart water 

Preparation : Soak the hominy over night in water in which it is 
to be cooked. Add the salt and cook slowly about four hours. Cook 
in tireless cooker if possible. 

Hominy may be served plain, in place of potatoes, or with a little 
butter, salt, pepper or cream. 

Hominy with Tomatoes Au Gratin 

Cooked hominy Canned tomatoes 

Bread crumbs Grated cheese 

Seasoning of Bait and paprika 

Preparation: Brush a baking dish with melted shortening, put a 
layer of hominy, then tomatoes and sprinkle of bread crumbs and cheese. 
Make three layers, having cheese and bread crumbs finish top. 

Place in moderate oven for thirty minutes. Serve hot or cold. This 
dish is extremely nourishing. 

Brush a baking dish with melted shortening and line plentifully with 
bread crumbs. Put in an inch deep layer of cold cooked hominy, then 
seasoning of salt and paprika or chili powder and a grating of cheese. 
Cover with bread crumbs. Make two such layers. 

Before adding the top layer of crumbs pour over tomato juice and 
then for the top layer have a goodly quantity of bread crumbs and 
grated cheese. Set the dish in another one of hot water and bake one- 
half hour. 

Hominy Fritters 

2 eggs 1 cup cooked hominy 

V2 cup milk 1 teaspoon CALUMET Baking 

1 teaspoon salt Powder 

Y 2 cup flour 

Preparation : Break the two egg whites into a bowl and beat very 
stiff, drop in the yolks and beat a moment more. Then add flour, salt, 
milk and CALUMET. Lastly stir in the hominy. Give these slightly 
more time to bake than griddle cakes. Serve hot with maple syrup, or 
with fried chicken. These fritters may be fried in deep fat or oil. 

Grits Blocks 

They may be prepared in the same manner as hominy, put in a mold 
to cool, cut into strips, cover with beaten egg, and then cracker meal. 
Fry in deep fat.

All measures level unless otherwise specified. 



Legumes 

Vegetables Containing Nitrogen and Starch 

Explanatory: The legumes are peas, beans, lentils and peanuts. 
They are rich in nitrogen and are exploited by vegetarians to take the 
place of meat in the dietary. Legumes furnish a hearty food and, 
supplemented by fats and other forms of starch than those which they 
contain, supply an energy making diet. 

* Legumin is digested and absorbed more slowly than other forms of 
protein, such as found in the casein of milk or albumin of eggs, etc., 
therefore, not suitable for constant diet of persons of sedentary habits. 
They are properly muscle and tissue builders when the system or diges- 
tive organs will assimilate them. 

The protein of beans and peas is of such a nature that it is easily 
toughened by hard water — it is therefore desirable to overcome this ten- 
dency by using a little soda. The better way to introduce the soda is to 
place 1 level teaspoon in the water in which the beans are soaked over 
night, pouring off the water in the morning. 

Baked Beans with Tomatoes 

2 cups tomatoes 2 cups navy beans 

Ya pound bacon ends or bam fat Vz teaspoon soda 

from boiled ham 1 small onion, grated 

1 pimiento 

Preparation : "Wash and cleanse the beans, and soak over night in 
water to much more than cover, dissolving the soda in the water. In 
the morning put the beans with the bacon ends to boil in fresh water 
that will cover at all times during cooking. The beans will require 
about one hour boiling, but watch carefully and when you can blow upon 
two or three beans and see the skin curl away or crack, it is time to put 
them in the bean pot to bake. 

Place the grated onion in the pot, pour in half of the beans, then the 
bacon and balance of the beans. Add the tomatoes to the liquor with 
seasoning of salt and pepper with a few spoonfuls of molasses if desired, 
and fill the bean pot. The beans require several hours to bake. 

If you are the happy possessor of a fireless cooker you may put the 
beans to soak in the morning and allow to bake the following night in 
the cooker. 

Stewed Lentils 

Wash half a pint of lentils, cover with cold water, and soak over 
night. Next morning drain, cover with fresh water, add a pinch of soda, 
and cook slowly one hour or until tender. Drain, return to the kettle, 
add a tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper. 
Shake for a moment until thoroughly hot and serve. 

78 



Lesson Number Thirteen 



Vegetables, Green and Succulent 

Explanatory: *The green or so-called succulent vegetables should 
be served at least once a day to serve as ballast and to excite the peri- 
staltic movement of the intestine. 

These vegetables are useful for their natural salts, which salts are 
easily lost in cooking, therefore in cooking such vegetables, if full benefit 
is desired from their use they should be cooked in very little water. 

SPINACH : This should be freed from sand and grit in quantities 
of water. Then placed to cook in covered vessel with no more water 
than clings to the leaves. Place the vessel where it will heat slowly and 
finally simmer. Then remove the cover. The liquor formed will most 
of it be taken up. That remaining may be used for soup or with the 
left-over spinach by the addition of some cream sauce and more water. 

While spinach is more often served as a vegetable, it is frequently 
used for salads, being first cooked then chilled, chopped and molded. 
It supplies salad material, extremely wholesome and palatable. 

GREEN PEPPERS : Green peppers add an important item to salad 
materials. They may be minced or cut into rings for salad, or they may 
be dropped into boiling water for a few moments until the skin can be 
peeled from them, then dropped into cold water, cut into small pieces, 
drenched with French dressing and served. 

ASPARAGUS: This contains a substance known as asparagin, 
which has a decided action upon the kidneys, and while it is popularly 
supposed to be beneficial, it is not known with any certainty just what 
its merits or demerits are. 

In preparing asparagus it is well to use a soft vegetable brush and 
go over each stalk separately to remove the grit which accumulates 
around the tips as it pushes its way above ground. The scales should 
be removed from the stalk. 

Salad Plants 

Explanatory : The salad plants are classed as ideal additions to the 
dietary, supplying as they do, natural mineral salts and volatile oils. 

Salad plants are usually much better and more appropriately dressed 
with a French dressing, or in some cases with a whipped cream dressing, 
rather than the heavier cooked or mayonnaise dressing. 

Salad plants are kept fresh and become crisp by folding in wet 
towel and keeping in cool place or near ice. If freshly pulled they 
should be allowed to remain in wet towel about one hour before serving. 

79 



LESSON No. 13 Domestic Science 



CHICORY is a common plant resembling the bleached endive, and 
with a much stronger flavor. It is a common winter salad plant, and 
often preferred to lettuce. After blanching and crisping in ice water, 
it is usually served with a French dressing. 

It is the root of this plant that is cut up, dried, roasted and marketed 
as a substitute for coffee. 

Chicory is bleached the same as celery, by tying the tops together 
and covering with sand. 

Chicory or Succory, as it is sometimes known, is at its best in the 
fall and often replaces the garden grown lettuce as a succulent green 
for salads and garnishes. 

LETTUCE in season all the year is one of our most common and 
universal salad greens. 

Its principal use is in salads, but sometimes it is cooked and served 
like spinach. The hothouse and winter lettuce is more delicate in flavor 
than that grown out of doors. It is wholesome, cooling and palatable. 

It is too delicate to serve with cooked or mayonnaise dressing, and 
wilts quickly when mixed with any dressing. French is the best dressing 
for it. Many prefer it sprinkled with salt or served with cream and a 
little sprinkle of sugar. 



Edible Weeds 

LAMBS ' QUARTERS : This is a common weed growing along road- 
sides and in gardens. It is light green in color with leaves that look 
dusted with frost. In the early season it is an easily accessible green 
and is cooked like spinach, with ham, bacon or by itself. 

PEPPER GRASS: Pepper grass or wild mustard is an edible 
weed, and is akin to true mustard as a seasoning, containing the mustard 
flavor without the irritating effect. 

NETTLES : These when young are used as greens, but care must 
be taken in their handling. They are the coarsest in texture of the edible 
weeds. 

SORREL : Sorrel or sour grass is both wild and cultivated. Used 
with chicory or lettuce as a salad. Also is used in soups and sauces. It 
contains oxalic acid. 

DANDELIONS: These form one of the most wholesome of all 
greens. They are at their best as soon as the leaves extend about two 
inches above the ground. They are in much finer condition when found 
in sheltered places. 

The leaves grow bitter as they grow older. 

Cook them in as little water as possible. 

To eat them as a salad, cleanse and free from grit and throw into 
cold water, then drain and serve, usually with salt and pepper or a 
French dressing. 



Lesson Number Fifteen 



Herbs 



SAGE is one of the important condiments and can be purchased dry 
or powdered. The sage now in powdered form is much superior to that 
of some years ago. Like all other articles covered by the pure food laws, 
it has been greatly improved. I would suggest, however, if sage dried on 
the stem is desired, that it be purchased green and cleansed thoroughly 
before drying, and then plaeed in covered receptacles to protect it from 
dust 

MINT : Spearmint is also called the meadow mint and grows wild 
in most parts of the United States. It is used both fresh and dried. 

Minced fine, mixed with vinegar and sugar, it becomes the mint 
sauce served with lamb. 

Crushed* and boiled in a syrup it is used for sherbets and punches. 

The leaves may also be candied, the same as violets or rose leaves. 
It may be dried to use for sweets or preserved in vinegar for sauces and 
salads. 

TARRAGON ; The green leaves of tarragon are mixed with lettuce 
and served with French dressing as a dinner salad. 

They are also dried and used in powdered form and in vinegar. 

Tarragon vinegar is used for sour sauces or salad dressings. It may 
be purchased as such or prepared when the fresh tarragon can be ob- 
tained, but the process takes about two months. 

CAPERS are the flower buds of a trailing shrub grown largely in 
Southern Europe. The buds are packed in bottles and covered with vine- 
gar. They are used for meat sauces and salads. 

NASTURTIUM : The fruit of the common garden nasturtium has 
a flavor similar to capers and is frequently used as a substitute. It is 
also added to pickles to preserve them and to spiced fruits. A half pint 
of nasturtiums added to a large jar of pickles will prevent mold. The 
flowers are used for sandwiches and as a garnish to summer salads. 

Remember this, and plant quantities of nasturtiums in the spring. 

GARLIC is a very strong member of the onion tribe. The bulbs or 
' ' cloves ' ' grow in clusters. One ' ' clove ' ' is sufficient to flavor a good-sized 
dish of food. 

Cloves of garlic may be cut up and placed in a bottle and the bottle 
filled with vinegar. This vinegar may be used for salads when the flavor 
of garlic is desired. 

BAY LEAVES: The dried bay leaves are imported and may be 
purchased at the drug stores. A dime!s worth will last an ordinary fam- 
ily a year or more. They "have a peculiar aroma and are in great demand 
as a seasoning for soups meats and sauces, 

82 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 15 

SWEET BASIL: Sweet Basil is a delightful herb to cultivate, 
grows profusely and gives forth a welcome aroma. 

A few sprigs dropped into the soup kettle impart a seasoning that 
can be compared to nothing else. 

Gathered and dried it may be used alone or mixed with other herbs 
to season soups and sauces. 

PARSLEY is of two varieties, the plain or single leaf and the fern 
or curled leaf. The former is used chiefly for soups, etc., and the latter 
is used as a garnish for salads, 

TO DRY PARSLEY FOR GARNISHING, select the large, curly 
variety. Wash thoroughly. Dip one piece at a time into boiling watet, 
shake well and dry in the hot sun or warm oven. Keep in dry place 
between layers of paper in a tin can. It can then be used for garnishing 
by crushing the dry leaves. It is not as good for seasoning, but the color 
is a brighter green. For seasoning, dry it without dipping in the hot 
water and tie in bunches. Keep in tin cans or glass jars. 

WATER CRESS grows wild in streams or on the border of lakes. 
Mixed with other salad materials it is excellent. It is popular as a 
garnish for certain meat and fish dishes and is eaten when so served. 
It is anti-scorbutic, palatable and wholesome. 

Mixed Herbs 

For general kitchen use a very satisfactory mixture of herbs for sea- 
soning is sage, marjoram and thyme in proportions of thyme and mar- 
joram in equal quantity with double the amount of sage. Buy these 
herbs, dry, wipe leaves of dust, crumble and rub through coarse sieve, 
discarding the stems. 

This method will be found much more satisfactory than purchasing 
them already ground. The flavor is much more pungent and one can be 
confident that there are no ground stalks in the preparation. 

Seasoning Powder of Herbs 

One-half ounce each of thyme, summer savory, sweet marjoram, 
s i yeet basil, dried grated lemon rind, one ounce of dried parsley, one 
ounce of celeTy seed. 

Grind and powder these ingredients. Rub through a fine sieve and 
| bottle. This powder may be used as a seasoning for dressings, brown 
sauce, soups and other meat dishes. 

Herbs, To Preserve 

Herbs should be gathered on a bright dry day, just before flowering. 

Remove each leaf, place in the hot sun or in a warm oven so as to 
dry quickly to retain aromatic quality and color. 

Bottle when dry in wide neck bottles. 

83 



Lesson Number Sixteen 



Condiments 

Condiments are primarily used to give relish to the food and gratify 
the taste, and as such should be used sparingly. The people of warm 
climates use them more generously because of the fact that, as a constant 
ingredient in meat dishes, they prevent unnatural ferments from forming. 

They stimulate the digestion and are beneficial when used in 
moderation. It is from the Orientals and people of hot climates that we 
get our highest condiments. The hot weather dishes we naturally season 
more highly. The principal condiments are ginger, white and black 
pepper, mace, nutmeg, Indian curry powder, mustard, cloves, allspice, 
cinnamon, cassia, dill, fennel, cumin seed, coriander, celery seed, caraway, 
cardamon, anise, and the chili, bird' and cayenne peppers. 

BLACK PEPPER is made from the unripe berries, which are 
picked, dried, and ground, shells and all. The whole berries are called 
pepper corns. 

WHITE PEPPER is made from the ripe seed kernels of the same 
berry. Both white and black pepper contain an essential oil and 
flavoring. Of the two the white is the more pungent. 

MIGNONETTE pepper is the coarsely ground white pepper. 

PAPRIKA is made from Hungarian sweet red pepper. 

CAYENNE PEPPER is made by grinding the fruit pod of cap- 
sicum. 

CHILI PEPPERS are small pointed peppers used in making chili 
sauce. 

TABASCO SAUCE is made from the very hot bird pepper. 

PIMIENTOES: One canned variety of red pepper is marketed 
under the name of pimientoes. These are not at all hot, but have a 
distinctive flavor. The small sized can is sufficient for an average 
family for as long as they will keep, or they may be removed to a glass 
and covered with vinegar. 

GINGER is the root of a plant native to Southern Asia. Jamaica 
ginger is the best variety. The very young roots are scraped, boiled 
in a syrup until very clear and sold as candied or crystallized ginger. 
In the green condition or crystallized, ginger is used to flavor the insipid 
fruits. 

CLOVES are an unexpanded flower bud dried. In purchasing 
cloves select those rich in oil and of a dark color. Cloves very pungent 
must be used sparingly. 

ALLSPICE (Pimento) consists of the berry of a tropical shrub. 
On account of similarity in flavor to that of a mixture of cinnamon, 
nutmeg and cloves, it is called "allspice." 

84 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 16 

CINNAMON is the most generally used and popular of the spices. 
The best cinnamon <;omes from Ceylon. It is the bark of a tree of the 
laurel family, the same family that gives us in the temperate climate 
such plants as the sassafras and spice bush. True cinnamon is of splintery 
fibrous quality and is sweet and spicy, retaining its flavor long in the 
mouth. 

CASSIA is a species of cinnamon and is often sold under the latter 
name. 

CARAWAY, CORIANDER, POPPY SEED, CUMIN SEED, 
FENNEL and DILL are used by the Germans as flavorings for cakes, 
and breads, and are also greatly prized by the Orientals. 

CUMIN SEEDS are the chosen flavor for Dutch cheese. 

CARDAMON SEEDS are used as seasoning for meats, breads and 
cakes. The seeds are enclosed in a white pod and must be crushed or 
ground when used in breads and cakes. 

NUTMEGS are the seed kernel of a fruit which resembles a peach. 
The short round nutmegs are better than the long ones, which are rather 
dry. The tree from which they are gathered is a native of the East India 
Isjands and is cultivated in India and Central America. The best nut- 
megs, the Penang, ^re the shape of damson plums about an inch in 
length and are called Queen nutmegs. They average about seven to an 
ounce. The small pointed nutmegs, known as wild nutmegs, are of 
inferior quality and lack the oil and fragrance of the Queen nutmeg. 

MACE is the seed coat of the nutmeg, and like it, has an essential 
oil. It comes whole or ground and is more pungent than the nutmeg. 
Its quality depends greatly upon the kernel from which it is gathered. 
That from the Queen nutmeg being the best. 

MUSTARD is composed of both white and black mustard seeds. 
The black seeds contain an acrid substance which, when distilled with 
water changes into a pungent essential oil. The bright yellow mustard 
is usually colored with tumeric. 

INDIAN CURRY POWDER is not as popular as it should be. 
It can be procured, bottled, for use, better than it can be put up. Not 
many understand that to bring out the essential flavor the curry powder 
should first be sauted in oil or butter. 

% pound each of coriander seed and % ounce of cardamon seed 

tumeric 1 ounce each of Jamaica ginger 

1 ounce each of cumin seed and and allspice 

fennel seed 10 bay leaves 

Preparation : Grind all the ingredients except the bay leave's. Rub 
them through a fine hair sieve, mixing with the bay leaves. Bottle and 
cork sufficiently to exclude the air. 

CREOLE SEASONING. The Creole seasoning as marketed in 
the South is conceded to be a necessary adjunct to Creole sauces, used 
much with fish. It is made of ground sweet red peppers. 

GUMBO FILEE is made up of the young shoots of the Sassafras 
which are gathered, dried and powdered. In conjunction with ground 
okra it forms an ingredient for Gumbo Soups, and stews. 

85 , 



Fruits 

Fresh fruits are generally more appetizing, refreshing and cooling 
than tiie cooked fruits. 

Over-ripe and unripe fruits are to be avoided. 

Unripe fruit causes stomach and intestinal disturbances. 

Fortunately for the family purse the most useful fruits are long 
in season, the most reasonable in price, more plentiful and with better 
possibilities of preserving a supply when out of season. Fruits, like 
vegetables, are valuable for water acids and mineral salts which are 
more available in the uncooked than in the cooked fruit. 

Fruits of great acid content, as, PIE PLANT, CRANBERRIES, 
GOOSEBERRIES, CURRANTS, when made into pies or sauces will 
have better dietetic value if soda is used to neutralize some of the acid. 
In pie making, the soda (one-half teaspoon to each pie) may be well 
mixed with the sugar. A tablespoon of flour mixed with the sugar will 
not only take up the moisture but will take up some of the acid, not neu- 
tralizing it but rendering it less concentrated. 

In cooking fruits, sugar should be added before the process is com- 
plete. By cooking fruit a long time or in the presence of acids, the cane 
sugar is changed to invert sugar which has a peculiar penetrating sweet- 
ness, not as pleasant as the sweetness of cane sugar. 

When sweetening fruit sauces a small saving in sugar is gained by 
allowing the sugar to cook with the fruit. Long cooking is to be avoided, 
as the flavor of fruit would be affected. 

Preserving Hints 



Do not buy over-ripe or imperfect fruit for canning or preserving. 
There is no economy in it. 

Do not sprinkle sugar over the fruit and allow it to stand and 
draw out the juice. This will make most fruits leathery and it is only 
recommended in the making of conserves. 

Pineapples and quinces are more tender if simmered, covered closely, 
in clear water, or steamed until they begin to soften, then finished in 
the syrup. 

Have the syrup boiling when the fruit is added, then lower the 
Iheat and cook gently. Do not stir the fruit any more than necessary. 

Overcooking is an almost universal error. Skim out the fruit 
before it is soft and thoroughly cooked, as the hot syrup poured over 

86 



Domestic Science j LESSON No. 17 



it after it is put into jars will complete the cooking. After removing the 
fruit, boil the syrup for eight minutes before pouring over the fruit. 

For preserving without sealing, equal quantities (by weight) of 
fruit and sugar should be Used. Put them away in small receptacles to 
avoid disturbing a quantity. 

Small fruits retain their shape and color if sugared an hour before 
using. 

To prevent breaking, stand the glass jars on a folded wet towel, 
while filling with hot fruit. 

The jars in which fruit or vegetables are canned should be thor- 
oughly sterilized by heat and heated before filling. 

Sterilization by heat is the only insurance necessary against the 
insiduous bacteria. 

When canning fruits for pie material omit the sugar. 

When canning fruits for sauce, sterilize the jars, fill with fruit. 
Make a syrup of one part water to two parts sugar, cooking it five 
minutes, fill jars and set them in a boiler, place covers and cook one 
hour. Secure the covers and remove from the fire. 

Fruit Jelly 

The jellying of any juice depends upon the "pectin" contained 
in the fruit. Pie plant is deficient, hence the difficulty in making it jell. 

Here is a trade secret. Do you notice the labels on the store jelly 
read something like this: "The contents of this package are pure 
juice of strawberries and apples and cane sugar"? Which, being in- 
terpreted, means that the package labeled ' ' Strawberry Jelly, ' ' in com- 
pliance with the Pure Food Law, which demands that the ingredients be 
printed on the label, is not pure strawberry jelly. Strawberries are 
deficient also in that property of frmt known as pectin, and apples, 
which are generously supplied .with that property are levied upon to 
supply this want. 

Apples can always be relied upon to hefp ouT fhe housekeeper and 
manufacturer alike in this respect. 

Fruit juices must be well cooked, say about twenty minutes or more 
before adding the sugar, which should first be warmed in the oven. 
After adding the sugar, boil the syrup about five minutes, test and put 
in sterilized jars. Cover with paraffin. 

The piquant delicacy of the fruit flavor is destroyed by cooking 
too long with the sugar, and with a very acid juice the jellying property 
is destroyed by the turning of the sugar in long cooking with an acid 
into a mixture of dextrose and levulose. The sugar once turned to levu- 
[lose is syrupy in its consistency.

Miscellaneous Recipes Simplified 
Sauce Tartar 

A combination of chopped pickles, olives and capers with a ealad 
dressing preferably a mayonnaise dressing. 

German Cream Salad Dressing 

% teaspoon sugar % cup very rich sweet cream 
% teaspoon of white pepper (Sour cream is preferred bj 

1 teaspoon of salt many) 

% cup vinegar 

Preparation : Mix the dry ingredients, add the cream and stir until 
dissolved, then add the vinegar, stirring all the time. Never add the 
salad dressing to salad until just before serving. It is well to press gently 
in a towel. or napkin all greens which have been chilled in ice water, 
that they may be perfectly dry before adding the dressing. When the 
salad dressing is poured over the wet salad leaves, it is diluted, and the 
greater part falls to the bottom of the bowl, a watery, insipid mixture. 
"Evaporated milk is an excellent substitute for cream in this dressing. 
Use one-third as much vinegar as evaporated milk. * 

Salad Dressing 

It is almost impossible to make a perfect emulsion of oil and vinegar 
without using something for a medium. In mayonnaise dressing this 
is accomplished by using the yolk of eggs. There are salads where 
the use of a mayonnaise seems out of place and the French dressing just 
suits the palate. There is no hard and fast rule for the making of French 
Dressing. The only difficulty is that when the oil floats, too much vinegar 
has been added. This is One of the rules that is proven more in the 
exception than in observance. ^ 

1 teaspoonful salt % cup olive, oil 

1 teaspoonful sugar 4 to 6 tablespoons vinegar 

% teaspoonful pepper 

French Dressing 

% teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon olive oil 

% teaspoon pepper 2-4 tablespoon vinegar 

METHOD : The materials may be put together in a bottle, a patent 
stoppered bottle is very convenient for this purpose, as it is easily cleaned, 
and can be placed in the ice chamber of the refrigerator without fear of 
spilling its contents. Put the materials together, any time before serving, 
to chill and when salad is ready to serve, shake well and pour over the 
salad. 

Worcestershire, Harvey, Walnut, anchovy or tobasco sauce may be 
used to season a French dressing. Or an aromatic vinegar may be used 
instead of the plain. Onion juice or tomato catsup is equally in favor 
as seasoning.

Domestic Science LESSON No. 18 



Rubbing the salad dish with a cut clove of garlic is a popular sea' 
soning. 

For family use the housewife puts the salad and dressing all together 
and serves it complete. By a constant change of seasonings a variety of 
salads may be made up of the same materials. 

Salads should hold a prominent place in the daily menu. 

The green vegetables contain the salts necessary to the well being 
of our systems. The oil contributes to the heat of the body and a small 
amount of acid aids in the digestion of other foods and lends zest to 
the meal.

Cream Sauces 

Explanatory; Cream sauces without sugar are the base for any 
seasoning which may be added as desired, such as lemon juice, peppers, 
parsley, eggs cooked or uncooked, fish, etc., and are used (1st) for soups, 
(2nd) as accompaniment for meats, fish and vegetable dishes, (3rd) as a 
medium for croquettes and timbales. The sauces differ as to consistency. 

Cream Sauce (No. 1, Thin) 

1 cup milk % teaspoon salt 

} tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon flour 

Preparation : There are three ways of making whioh applj? to aU 
three sauces. The butter may be omitted in No. 1. 

Method No. 1 : Mix the flour with about half its bulk of milk, beat 
smooth and add enough more to thin sufficiently to add to the hot milk 
without lumps, Heat the milk and stir in the mixture with the butter 
and salt. . Cook until creamy. 

Cream Sauce (No. 2, Medium)

Lesson Number Nineteen 



Beverages 

COFFEE, Explanatory: Coffee heads the list of desirable bever- 
ages. 

Green Coffee improves with age under proper conditions. 

Roasted CoffSe on the contrary deteriorates. 

Boasted and Ground Coffees, like most of our food 1 products, were 
for years, badly adulterated, but that condition has been largely changed 
with the advent of our pure food laws. Our greatest protection is in a 
sealed package with the manufacturer's name on the label. 

COFFEE CHAFF: Coffee processes in the last decade have dis- 
closed the means of eliminating the undesirable chaff to which was laid 
the only real objection to coffee effects, as the chaff contains the tannin, 
the effect of which, in coffee, has been considered injurious. 

The ordinary grinding process of a decade ago has undergone a 
revolution to the vast improvement o^ coffee. The better grades are 
now steel cut into uniform size instead of crushed into large and small 
particles and dust 

Quality in a measure determines the price. 

GROUND CHICORY is often added to cheap or inferior coffee. 
We advise that ground chicory root (which resembles ground coffee) be 
purchased of tea and coffee merchants, and added to coffee if the flavor 

is desired. 

i 

COFFEE ECONOMY: It is economy to use pulverized coffee of 
high grade rather than cheap grade coffee coarsely or indifferently 
ground. 

COFFEE PERCOLATORS: These standardize the coffee to be 
served, as they compel accurate measurement, 

LEFT-OVER COFFEE : Good coffee may be kept hot for some 
(time provided the grounds are removed; properly made coffee may be 
reheated if poured off the grounds before setting it away. There is no 
reason why a housewife who would carefully put away a thimbleful of 
butter left on a plate would throw away two or three cups of left-over 
coffee. 

METHOD : Pour the coffee from the grounds and set away. When 
coffee is prepared for the following meal, make the measure less by the 
amount of left-over coffee. Make coffee in Esual way. Reheat but do not 
boil the cold coffee and when the regular coffee is ready for the table 
add the reheated coffee to it.

LESSON No. 19 Domestic Science 



Perfect Coffee 

Select a good quality of coffee, not necessarily the highest priced. 
Have the coffee ground fine and uniform, steel cut preferred. Supply 
yourself with a granite coffee pot with a white lining or one of aluminum, 
always keeping it as sweet and clean as your dinner plates. For six 
persons place six rounding tablespoons of coffee in the coffee pot. Pour 
over the coffee three pints (six cups) of boiled water. Place over a 
gentle flame and simmer five minutes after reaching the boiling point. 
Then mix about two teaspoons of egg in one-half cup of cold water and 
pour into the coffee to clear. 

To secure the perfeet beverage it is absolutely necessary to immerse 
the coffee and simmer in order that the essential oil and flavor of the 
berry be extracted. Some particular persons heat the ground coffee 
slightly before adding the water. 

Cafe Noir 

(After Dinner Ooffee) 

After dinner coffee is stronger and richer than that made for the 
breakfast table, and is served clear, although cream may be passed with 
the sugar. 

When Cognac or Petit Brule is served with the after dinner coffee, 
cream is entirely out of place. 

# When Cognac is served with the black coffee, the loaf or domino 
sugar is placed in the spoon over the cup of coffee, and the cognac is 
poured over the sugar and a lighted match touched to it When burned 
away, the spoon and contents are dipped into the cup. This carmelizes 
the sugar and when added to the coffee imparts to it a special flavor, 
that is very appropriate after a heavy dinner. 

Tea 

Scald the pot. Eemove the water, and put in a level teaspoon of 
£Ood tea to each cup of water. Take the water at its first boil. Cover 
the pot with a cozy and stand it away from the fire for five minutes. 
Stir the tea and pour at once. 

The ordinary English tea cozy, a sort of padded cap, is to be recom- 
mended. 

CAUTION : Tea must not be made over the fire, nor should it be 
made in a metal pot. The tannic acid acts on the metal, destroys the 
flavor of the tea and makes the infusion unwholesome. 

LEMON WITH BLACK TEA serves a certain dietetic purpose. 
"This is not a mere fad or 'foreign fashion,' there is a scientific reason 
beneath the surface. The citric acid of the fruit offsets the tannic add 
of the tea rendering it refreshing and wholesome. It is needless to add 
that black tea be used, not the green or mixed." — R. M. Fletcher Berry.

Domestic Science LESSON No. 19 



Chocolate 

To make one quart of chocolate, put into a saucepan four rounding 
teaspoons of grated chocolate. Add a half pint of boiling water, stirring 
all the white, until the mixture reaches boiling point. Boil just a moment. 

Add one and one-half pints of milk, and three rounding tablespoons 
of sugar, and stir constantly until the milk is very hot. Take from the 
fire, turn into a heated chocolate pot and serve with whipped cream. 

In the absence of whipped cream which is not always available, a 
marshmallow is placed in each cup and the chocolate poured around it. 

Plain cream is passed in a pitcher. 

The chocolate is very often made with water omitting the milk 
entirely. 

Lemons in Drinks 

"When one is forty miles from a lemon, one may still have 'lemon- 
ade* by using citric acid in crystals or pulverized, with or without a 
pure lemon tincture as flavoring. No ill effects can .accrue from using 
this acid in such trifling quantity as required to make tart a drink or 
pudding sauce. It cannot completely take the place of the fruit juice, 
but, as it is the acid found in, and taken from the fruits of the citrus 
family, it can be substituted, therefore, if necessary, in moderation with- 
out harm." — R. M. Fletcher Berry. 



EQUIPMENT OF KITCHEN 

(Care and Requirements) 

Kitchen Floor 

The kitchen floor will be more sanitary and easily kept clean if well 
oiled. Then, with warm, soapy water the floor can be cleansed. Avoid 
white scrubbed floor. Constant scrubbing with strong alkalies robs the 
wood of its natural resistance to absorption. Thereby rendering it less 
sanitary. 

A model kitchen will be provided with ranges, work tables, sink and 
cupboards easy of access and arranged in proper relation to each other 
to avoid needless steps in the preparation of the food, in the placing of 
it on the table, and the clearing up of soiled dishes. 

China Closets and Cupboards 

For convenience in placing food and dishes on the table a combina- 
tion china closet and cupboard should be built in between the kitchen and 
dining-room with shelves, and drawers and a serving buffet accessible 
from both rooms. 

Wheel Tray 

If living in rented apartments without these conveniences built in, 
provide a wheel tray upon which to place all needed articles for setting 
the table. When food is prepared the wheel tray will convey it to the 
dining-room and later carry the soiled dishes to the kitchen. 

In the absence of a wheel tray a light pine box thirty-two inches long 
and about twenty-four by fourteen inches can be substituted by putting 
ball bearing rubberoid casters on one end and staining the box to corre- 
spond with the finish of the woodwork or enameling it an ivory white. 

, Sinks 

Sinks should be placed in the center of wall space instead of in 
corner of kitchen. 

Sinks should have drain pipe in the center with drainboard on each 
side. The drain pipe should be provided with large trap and easily re- 
movable screw cap, which, in case of emergency can be taken off to drain a 
stopped up pipe. Before leaving the kitchen sink when the work is com- 
pleted, a quart or so of boiling water should be poured down the sink to 
flush the pipes and leave the trap full of clean water. 

Pantry 

Only in the larger families are pantries a necessity where large stores 
of food must be kept. 

For the small or medium family kitchen cupboards and refrigerator 
will take care of all provisions and have everything easily accessible. 

94 



Domestic Science LESSON No. 20 



Lighting and Ventilation 

Too much attention cannot be given to the proper arrangement for 
light and ventilation. If the kitchen is a one-story addition, there is noth- 
ing better than a properly constructed metal skylight with ventilator. 

Windows should be placed over sinks and work tables. Casement 
windows with fine white screening provide good light and ventilation 
over sinks and ranges. They may be fitted with sliding frames or with 
glass doors. Windows should be placed in all outside walls of the kitchen. 
Large, easily reached windows should be placed in cellar-way. Shelves, 
cupboards and drawers are much more satisfactory if coated with white 
paint or enamel. 

A kitchen closet shallow in depth should be fitted with hooks for 
brooms, mops, pails, brushes and shelves for soaps and cleaning powders, 
and all of the paraphernalia for cleaning purposes. 

Refrigerators 

These should be built into wall so that ice can be put in from out- 
side. Drain pipe with trap should be connected with sewer. There 
should be a trap in the sewer pipe in addition to the small trap in ref rig. 
erator pipe. The connection must not be sealed. 

Refrigerators if not properly cared for may become a serious menace 
to health. Cleanliness is essential to the proper care of foods. 

Milk, cream and butter should each have their perfectly tight cov- 
ers, as their flavor and keeping quality is subject to surrounding odors. 
The flavor of butter is easily destroyed when left uncovered in a refrig- 
erator in which fruit or onions are exposed. 



Gas Range 

The gas range seems to be the most difficult of all ranges to keep 
clean, and manufacturers are placing ranges now on the market that are 
enameled. 

Do not use scouring soaps on the gas range. If inclined to rust, rub 
a little clean grease on it. 

The blaze should be light blue. If the balance of air (oxygen) and 
gas (carbon) is as it should be the flame will produce the greatest amount 
of heat. The red or yellow flame indicates that there is not enough air 
mixed with the gas. This condition should be changed at once by open- 
ing the air mixer or reducing the flow of gas from the small orifice. This 
is accomplished with a wrench to fit the connection, or with a pair of 
pliers. The difference can be easily noted in the supply of heat by hold- 
ing the hand over the flame when the air is shut off, and again when the 
adjustment is right.

LESSON No. 20 ' Domestic Science 

System 

System is a great aid to efficiency in all things but more so in the 
kitchen than in any other part of the home. 

It is not always possible to proceed in the same routine each day with 
the household duties but certain duties must be taken care of each day 
that there may be no accumulation of neglect. 

WORK TABLES, SINKS and RANGE OVENS should be proper 
height from the floor to eliminate tedious stooping. Thirty-two or thirty- 
four inches is now considered standard. The kitchen is the laboratory^ 
or workshop of the home and should be properly equipped for efficient 
work. Certain essentials are necessary to neatness and dispatch. The 
furniture of the kitchen should be arranged so that few steps are required. 

SHELVES or RACKS with large china closet hooks on the under 
side arranged near the range and tables afford a convenient means of 
having at hand small skillets, cooking forks, basting spoons, egg beaters 
and the various tools in almost constant use. 

The FLOUR and SUGAR BINS should be metal lined with cover of 
same materials to properly safeguard these materials from mice or pests. 

HOLDERS about a foot square made from heavy outing cloth with 
brass ring secured to one corner should hang near the range where hands 
can find them quickly. 

A HIGH STOOL relieves some of the strain, when duties demand 
much standing in the kitchen. 

BRUSHES of all kinds should be in the kitchen to facilitate clean- 
ing. 

Fit the tables and movable furniture with BALL-BEARING 
CASTERS. 

ALUMINUM solves the problem in cooking utensils, being at once 
light, durable and fool-proof. When accidents happen, as happen they 
will, the aluminum dish comes out of the mishap unscathed. Acid does 
not form a poison when in contact with aluminum. 

COOKING UTENSILS should be selected with long, strong handles, 
rather than bails, so as to keep the hands as far away as possible from 
the uncomfortable and destroying heat, also pans and kettles provided 
with long handles can be hung up, thus disposing of them to better advan- 
tage in the cupboard. While the first cost of aluminum may seem higher 
than for other metals, their long wear and serviceable quality makes 
aluminum utensils cheaper in the end. 

Molding Canvas, being a piece of blue and white ticking or can- 
! vas three-quarters of a yard square and double, forms a better sur- 
face on which to roll out baking powder biscuits, cookies, doughnuts, 
pastry, etc., than the ordinary molding board. Less flour adheres to the 
article under preparation. It can be folded up and laid away each time, 
is less trouble to care for and more cleanly than the molding board. 

The canvas or ticking may go to the laundry just the same as any 
other kitchen linen.

Dish Washing r > 

Collect knives, then forks and spoons, place them in a bowl, handles 
up. When ready to wash set bowl and all into the dish pan. This is 
a much more sensible way than scattering them in the dish pan of hot 
water. Scrape all crumbs, scraps and dough from the dishes into the 
waste jar, if there is some definite use for them. If there is no animal 
to dispose of them scrape them into a paper and burn them. , 

Dishes with egg or dough adhering to them should be put to soak 
in cold water. 

Pile all dishes of each kind together in the dish pan with drainer near 
at hand. Fill the dish pan half full of soapy water. Wash the glasses 
first, rinse and dry at once. Then wash the cups, saucers, plates, etc., 
taking the cleaner and smaller dishes first. Wash the silver, rinsing all 
with hot water. Last of all wash the cooking utensils and scour if neces- 
sary. Do not put wooden handles of knives, forks or the Dover egg 
beater into the water. Never leave soap in the sink or dish pan. When 
all are wiped, pile the different kinds together and put in their places. 
Empty dish pan, wash the towels in hot water, rinse and hang to dry. 
Wash table in cold soapy water, soap dish and sink in hot soapy water. 

Towels made from flour sacks or unbleached muslin of same quality, 
and hemmed, make the best dish towels. The best dish cloths and the 
most satisfactory, are those sold for the purpose as they never become 
stringy. A small ox-fiber brush with a long handle and a good bristle 
bottle brush are, with the dish mop, indispensable in doing up the kitchen 
work and save the hands a great deal of discomfort, keeping them in 
better condition. No woman with common sense will recklessly or need- 
lessly sacrifice the comfort and appearance of her hands over such a 
mechanical detail of the housework. 

Neither can the washing of the dishes be accomplished nran en- 
tirely sanitary way unless the dish cloth and dish towels give place to 
hot soapy water and dish mop and long handled brushes. These sanitary 
Conditions preclude the putting of the hands into the water. My further 
advice is to make one operation per day of the dish washing, for the 
small family, and where no maid is kept. In large families a dish wash- 
ing machine is an economy of time, energy and a necessity. >

Don't be without reliable scales. 

Don't be without a set of tested measures, both dry and liquid. 

Don't be without a yard stick. 

Don't buy from a dealer or huckster who uses dented measures. 

Don't be afraid to tell your dealer if you are being cheated; it 
may be the fault of his clerk. 

Don't waste energy, time and strength by taking unnecessary steps. 

Don't fail to use your head to save your heels. 

Don't neglect your refrigerator; several million bacteria may be 
breeding in the drain pipe. 

Dont fail to make an intimate acquaintance of the sanitary paper* 
specially prepared for various household purposes. 

Don't have sink and table too low for comfort. Secure good light 
for sink and range, and don't have either in dark corner. 

Don't overlook covering drain boards with zinc or galvanized iron 
when the sink and drain shelves are not in one piece. The most sanitary 
sink is of white enamel, with sink, wall back and drain shelves in one 
piece. 

Fireless Cooker — The fireless cooker with radiator is almost as nec- 
essary as the range. Fitted with aluminum vessels and heating plate 
or radiator, they can be obtained at the stores, and are so complete that 
the amateur hesitates to make one at home, but many very good ones 
are made with a 50-pound lard can, a galvanized inner can for a lining 
and a filling of clean ashes as a non-conductor. The aluminum cooker 
vessels with tightly clamped cover and the radiators purchased at the 
department stores complete a very serviceable fireless cooker. 

Consult your State "Weight and Measure Department regarding 
weights and measures. 

Send to the Agricultural Department at Washington, D. C, for 
pamphlets on cooking, canning of fruits and vegetables, sanitation and 
plans for model farms and farm houses. These are free for the asking. 

Every kitchen should be provided with a tested scale of about 20 
pounds capacity. 

See that every dollar buys a hundred cents' worth 

Check up your purchases when delivered and see if they agree with 
your order. 

Order your groceries for the day early in the morning and do not 
ask your dealer to deliver twice in one day. 

Pay your bills promptly and discourage the trading stamp evil. 

Discourage also the killing of calves for food as one of the reasons 
for the high cost of beef. Let them grow until they are valuable as food 
and a profit to the stock raiser.

Hints for the House-wife 



Contributed by Ralph W. Smith, Minn. Dept. of Weights and Measures. 

Make a business of your kitchen and run that business as carefully 
as does the merchant who sells you your food commodity. 

Provide yourself with a reliable scale and correct measures, and in 
order to give them ,fhe' same legal status as those of your merchant, as 
well as to assure yourself of their accuracy, have them tested and sealed 
by a Weights and. Measures officer.* 

Inform yourself as to the Weights and Measures laws of your State 
or City that you may know haw food products should be sold; use your 
sealed scale and measures to check your purchases ; if there is a violation 
of the law or a discrepancy in weight or measure, notify the Weights

In making a purchase by weight, observe whether the scale is in 
balance before the weighing is performed, that is, whether the beam 
oscillates freely in case of a beam scale, or whether the indicating pointer 
rests on zero in a computing scale. 

Bear in mind that a liquid quart is not the same as a dry quart, but 
that the dry quart of 67.2 cubic inches is over 14 per cent larger than the 
liquid quart of 57.75 cubic inches. Remember also that in most States 
the sale, of a dry commodity by the bushel, peck, etc., means a sale of a 
definite number of pounds. In buying dry commodities, therefore, pro- 
cure the bushel list of your State and check your purchases bv weight 
from that table. 

Buy in definite quantities, as so many pounds or so many quarts; 
DO NOT buy a dime's worth or a quarter's worth. 

If you buy foodstuffs put up in package form, remember that there 
is a Federal law requiring the net contents of the package to be marked 
thereon. Look for this marking and you can still tell just how much 
you are buying. 

Familiarize yourself with the tables given below so that you ean 
think intelligently in terms of the different units :
