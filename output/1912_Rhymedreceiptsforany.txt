SALADS 

Well read, deeply learned and thoroughly 
grounded in the hidden knowledge of all salads. 
— Beaumont and Fletcher. 

Variety's the very spice of life 
That gives it all its flavor. 

— Corvper.

CUCUMBER BOATS 

The hand that hath made you fair, hath made 
you good. 

— Measure for Measure. 

Take small cucumbers for your fleet. 
And treat each one the self-same way. 

Cut lengthwise slice from lower side. 
Forming a keel that straight will stay. 

Then hollow out the upper side 

To make a little oval boat, 
And set each on a sep'rate plate, 

As if it ready were to float. 

Fill in as cargo shredded pine 

(Fragrant, and sweet beyond all 
praise) , 
Diced cucumbers, and walnut meats. 

All closely bound with mayonnaise. 



Now launch your fleet, and rest assured 

The venture will successful be. 
How good it were could such a fate 
L Bless all the ships you send to sea! 






JAPANESE SALAD 

The image of it gives me content already. 
— Measure for Measure. 

In Chrysanthemum Land, far over the 

sea, 
They gave me this salad for Sunday 

night tea, 
And, I'm sure you'll believe, I ate it with 

glee. 

Shredded apples, and truffles, and celery 
white. 

Well seasoned and mixed, as I saw with 
delight. 

With Chrysanthemum flowers all glow- 
ing and bright; 

These covered with mayonnaise, golden 

of hue. 
With hard-boiled eggs garnished, and 

green olives too. 
Were served in a bowl of rich Japanese 

blue.

BANANA SALAD 

HoTV many things by season seasoned are 
To their right praise and true perfection. 

— Merchant of Venice. 

Select bananas, gold of hue. 

And uniform in size, 
With care remove the fruit, and slice 

Quite thin — I would advise. 

Mix these slim rounds with pecan meats 

Broken in tiny bits, 
And grape fruit shredded finely, too. 

And robbed of all its pits. 

This medley next is drenched with oil. 

And lemon juice combined, 
The hollow skins are then filled up, 

Or — shall we say — relined ? 

Now place upon crisp lettuce leaves, 

Or curly water-cress, 
The golden shapes, and walnuts add 

Shorn of their outer dress.

STUFFED PRUNE SALAD 

Just, as in nature, thy proportions be. 
As full of concord their variety. 

— A. Cowley. 

Wash a pound of large prunes — the 
larger, the better — 

And soak for three hours (do this to the 
letter!). 

Then cook them, I pray, until they are 
tender, 

And after they cool, to give them new 
splendor. 

Their pits cast aside — their stony inter- 
nals — 

And stuff them quite full with rich wal- 
nut kernels. 

On separate plates leaves of lettuce ar- 
ray, 

And three prunes — or four — in each 
nest stow away; 

Then cast over all that goldenest bless- 
ing. 

Which we mortals name a mayonnaise 
dressing.

MUSK MELONS AND GRAPE- 
FRUIT 

No other terms than unconditional and immedi- 
ate surrender. I propose to move immediately 
upon your works. 

— U. S. Grant. 

Select small melons — firm, and chilled — 

And cut each one in two. 
Next scoop the centre out and leave 

A gen'rous space in view. 

With grape-fruit bits, and melon dice 

Proceed these nests to fill. 
Then with French dressing marinate, 

And win your guests' good will. 

Instead of grape-fruit — oranges 

May be preferred by some, 
And if they're used with chopped nut 
meats 

All cavilling is dumb.

PEACH SALAD 

A modern ecstasy. 

— Macbeth. 

Choose fine large peaches, peel and halve, 

And cast the stones aside, 
Then, till they're very firm and cold, 

On ice let them abide. 

Put lettuce leaves on separate plates. 
And in each nest the fruit — 

Filled with whipped cream and mayon- 
naise — 
The hardest taste they'll suit.

WATERMELON SALAD 

I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in it. 

— Twelfth Night. 

Before the coming of Jack Frost, 
While summer lingers with her spell, 

Let this most simple salad course 
Charm eye, and palate, too, as well. 

Out of a watermelon ripe 

Cut rounds from the delicious red, 
Using the scoop with which the cook 

Oft makes potato balls instead. 

Drain these and chill, then place each one 
Amid crisp leaves of lettuce green, 

Like hearts of rose, while over all 
French dressing glistens with its sheen.

FLOWER OF A LILY 

(pimento and cheese salad) 

Practice is everything. 

— Periander. 

Drain a small can of Pimentoes, 

Then each one lay out flat, and trim 

The edges evenly and neat. 

And shape into a cone form slim. 

Next mash a cheese — one made of 
cream — 

With enough oil, or cream, that you 
May roll it with your hand in pipes 

Like macaroni thick and new. 

Each cone of red Pimento lay 
On little leaves of lettuce white. 

And when the cheese is pressed inside 
French dressing add, just seasoned 
right. 

If these precepts you take to heart, 
And strive to follow well and true, 

Each guest will murmur with delight 
When the lily flower meets his view. 



BANANA AND NUT SALAD 

These reasons made his mouth to water, 

— Butler. 

Here's a dainty salad. 
Worthy of a ballad, 
Or — you will admit — of any kind of 
song. 
Take some red bananas 
(Product of Havana's!), 
Strip of peel, and cut in cubes just three 
inches long. 

Next these pieces (which you 
Roll in crumbs of rich hue, 
Made of peanuts powdered fine as ocean's 
sand,) 
Lay on lettuce duly. 
And to crown all truly 
O'er the whole French dressing you pour 
with spendthrift hand.

DESSERTS 

The daintiest last to make the end most sweet. 

— Richard II. 

Any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William 
cook. 

— // Henry IV. 









MT. ETNA IN ICES 

Comfort me with cold. 

— King John. 

In crystal glasses for your guests 

First, as foundation stand 
Ice-cream that's from Pistachio made. 

Green as the summer land. 

Next strawberries — fresh, luscious, red — 

Arrange in layer neat, 
Flavored with Maraschino wine. 

Like breath of flowers sweet. 

And now vanilla ice-cream take 

And build a little cone, 
A tiny mountain from whose top — 

As if with lava strewn — 

Some almonds place; the mimic stream 

Will cause no least alarm. 
Indeed, Mt. Etna viewed like this 

Possesses only charm.

FRUITED WHIPPED CREAM 

Infinite riches in a little room. 

— Marlowe. 

Whip until stiff a pint of cream 

(The cream must suffer, and not you!) , 

Sweeten it now with lavish hand, 
And add this mixture thereunto. 

One cup of strawberries left whole, 
And one of shredded, juicy pine, 

With orange and banana mixed, 
Cut into dice all rather fine. 

Serve very cold. And, one thing more. 
Be sure the cream is extra sweet. 

The fruit is acid, and you know 
" The little less " oft mars the treat. 









PEAR COMPOTE 

That I should live so long 
And ignorant of such wealth as this. 

— Randolph. 

Peel some small pears, and leave them 
whole, 

Nor cut their stems away, 
In water stand, where lemon juice 

Will keep them white, they say. 

Next boil a cup of sugar sweet — 

The granulated's best — 
With tablespoon of water, till 

It threads. That is the test! 

Dry well, and form in pyramid 
The pears, on which you pour 

The half-cold sirup, so each one 
With glaze is coated o'er. 

Put this to cool. Then, with whipped 
cream 
Heaped all around the base, 




wa 



M^StntXf Mtttipt$^ 



Serve cold as ice from Polar seas, 
Or any frigid place. 

Good as this sounds, if o'er the fruit, 

Before the sirup's " set," 
Almonds are cast, or other nuts. 

You'll find it better yet. 

AFTERTHOUGHT 

Thrice better, though, if peaches small 
Are used the self -same way. 

Well sprinkled with pistachio nuts — 
None can this fact gainsay.

" MOONSHINE " 

Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. 

— Hamlet. 

" Find out moonshine " was the word 
That " a wood near Athens " heard; 
And to Bottom, when he cried. 
An almanac there was suppHed. 
But no almanac to-day 
Of my " Moonshine " aught can say. 
Rather seek of me to know 
In the lines subjoined below: 

Yolks of eggs, that number three, 

Must be beaten steadily 

Till they spread a glist'ning froth, 

Stiff as snow from out the north. 

Now for sugar — piled up high 

Thrice in teaspoon it must lie — 

This is added to the bowl, 

And with force you beat the whole. 



Next three peaches, ripe and sweet. 
In small pieces join the treat, 



egg /- =\ri-ig

Then a pint of thick, rich cream, 
Then vanilla — a small stream — 
And, for a completer spell, 
Brandy goes the list to swell. 
Just a trifle, if you please, 
What two teaspoons hold with ease. 

Now the whole must frozen be. 
Ere it's really done, you see, 
Just as if it were ice-cream 
(Though it tastes more like a dream!) 
Serve in glasses very thin — 
How it glimmers there within. 
Golden as the Harvest Moon 
Caught somehow by mortal spoon.

MELON RINGS AND ICE- 
CREAM 

They're welcome all, let 'em have kind admittance. 

— Timon of Athens. 

Select small, spicy Cantaloupes — 
You know the kind I mean — 

Slice cross-wise into rings, then scrape 
The seeds away quite clean. 

The fruit is chilled, and, when it's served. 

Each circle on its plate 
Has for a heart rich, white Ice-cream — 

Is that a cruel fate?

FRENCH PINEAPPLE BISQUE 

A hit, a very palpable hit! 

— Hamlet. 

Beat with one cup of sugar white 
(The powdered is the best, I deem), 

Yolks of four eggs, then stir till light, 
And add thereto a pint of cream. 

Next turn into the foamy mass 
A can of golden, shredded pine, 

Mixed well with brandy (one small 
glass). 
And macaroons crushed very fine. 

Let freeze ; and when the time draws nigh 
To serve this dainty at your feast. 

See it approach with kindling eye — 
Perfection — at the very least!

DATE JELLY 

Feelf masters, how I shake. 

— II Henry IV. 

To make this jelly stew some dates, I 

pray. 
Until the stones slip easily away. 
Then take a mold — a circle one is best — 
And in it place, like lining in a nest, 
The rich, dark fruit cut into little strips; 
Next add a layer made of almond chips ; 
Then one of dates, then nuts, then dates 

once more. 
And over all clear lemon jelly pour. 
Set on the ice until it's time to serve 
Heaped with whipped cream in many a 

graceful curve.

ORANGE COMPOTE 

He hath been used 
Ever to conquer. 

— Coriolanus. 

Take oranges of medium size. 

The peel remove, I pray, 
From each a round cut from one end, 

And scoop the seeds away. 

Fill up the httle cups thus formed 

With strawberry preserve, 
The flavor mixed with orange juice 

Is more than most deserve. 

Then top each orange with whipped 
cream, 

A cap all soft and white, 
Made up of puffs, while for rosettes 

Whole strawberries gleam bright. 

On separate plates the fruit then serve 

With lady fingers slim, 
And I've no doubt a king would say 

The dish was fit for him,!

WATERMELON BALLS 

Give us a taste of your quality. 

— Hamlet. 

Cut a fine melon into halves. 

And from the lovely pink 
Make balls with a potato-scoop — 

They're prettier than you think. 

Next chill and sweeten, then pile up 

In glasses sparkling bright. 
The rosy shapes with sherry drenched 

To make the flavor right.

TURKISH PARFAIT 

Give us the luxuries of life and we will dispense 
with its necessaries. 

— J. L. Motley. 

" Coffee, which makes the politician' 

wise," 
From Turkey comes in this dehcious 

guise: 
Within a basin put a quarter-pound 
Of freshly roasted berries, still unground, 
A bit of sweet vanilla pod, then pour 
On these a pint of hot cream (and no 

more). 
Set all to steep for thirty minutes quite. 
What time — with quarter-pound of 

sugar white. 
You cream the yolks of half a dozen eggs. 
And put the same — the chef from Tur- 
key begs — 
With the infusion. Next the basin stand 
In boiling water, and with vig'rous hand 
The fragrant mixture stir repeatedly 
Until it's thick as honey from the bee. 









Remove and strain. Add half a pint of 

cream. 
And beat o'er ice till cold. Then serve 

and dream! 









VIENNA FILLED APPLES 

A dish fit for the gods. 

— Julius Caesar. 

Take apples and remove the cores, 
Scrape well the pulp away, 

And in each hollow cup thus formed 
This medley duly lay: 

Sugar, and grated lemon peel, 
And raisins chopped to shreds. 

With apple snips, and bits of nuts. 
And cinnamon in threads. 

Now set the apples in a pan, 

And pour upon the fruit 
A cup of wine — with water mixed — 

And sweet, the taste to suit. 

When you have stewed the apples till 
They've very tender grown, 

Serve cold, each on a sep'rate plate. 
With the rich sauce o'erstrewn.

FRENCH ORANGE COMPOTE 

Muse, sing the man that did to Paris go. 

— TV. King. 

Sugar and water you combine 

To make a sirup sweet, 
Adding a little lemon juice, 

The flavor to complete. 

Peel oranges, the seeds discard. 

Cut into quarters true, 
Lay in the boiling sirup next. 

And cook ten minutes through. 

Place on a crystal dish the fruit. 
O'er which the siinip pour. 

And strew with candied cherries red, 
To give the one touch more.

CHRISTMAS CHARLOTTE 
RUSSE 

We'll keep our Christmas merry still. 

— Walter Scott. 

Whip up a pint of well chilled cream 

Till it's a fairy fluff, 
Then powdered sugar fold within, 

Your taste is guide enough. 



Add tablespoon of gelatine 

Dissolved in water cold 
(The cup should be but quarter full. 

And drop by drop it's told). 

Next candied cherries, chopped in bits. 
Ruddy and gleaming bright. 

From a big cup are turned upon 
The mass of snowj^ white. 

Serve this within a sponge-cake shell, 
The dish all wreathed about 

With holly leaves, between whose 
green 
Red berries twinkle out.

"LADY BALTIMORE" CAKE 

I awoke one morning and found myself famous. 

— Byron. 

In a southern city shady there's a cake 

named for a Lady, 
One who doubtless was the darling of the 

house of Baltimore, 
Naught know we of this fair sister, yet 

a writer — Owen Wister — 
Called his novel by the cake's name — 

into thousands it did soar! 
But it surely was the Cake's fame that 

did make the story soar — 
Merely this, and nothing more. 

For that peerless, toothsome matter, this 

is how they make the batter: 
Just one cup of golden butter, two of 

sugar, I implore! 
Cup of milk, and three of flour — half 

another of that dower — 
Two teaspoons of baking-powder, whites 

of six eggs well whipped o'er. 






And one spoon in which rose-water has 
been duly filtered o'er. 
JNIerely these, and nothing more. 

Now there still remains the " filling," 

which the layers keep from spilling 
(And it's thickly used as frosting on the 

top and sides galore) : 
Three cups sugar, one of water, boiled 

until it threads (or "oughter"). 
Beaten with the whites of three eggs, in 

which cup of raisins pour — 
Also cup of chopped pecan meats, and 

five figs sliced thin, you pour. 
Only these, ar^^^ nothing more. 










" ROCKS " 

Like, but oh! how different. 

— Wordsworth. 

Most people think that rocks are stones 

And never meant to eat, 
But if you'll make the ones I mean, 

You'll find them quite a treat. 

One cup of powdered sugar take, 

Two-thirds of butter add, 
And cream together soft and smooth — 

The work will make you glad. 

Two eggs, well beaten, go in next, 

Then 'tis the flour's turn. 
One cup, and half a cupful more — 

But any extra spurn. 

A teaspoonful of cinnamon. 

And one of powdered clove, 
A pound of walnuts chopped with pound 

Of raisins that we love. 

These add with soda — well dissolved 
(A teaspoonful — that's all!) 



4/ Mt^stntXt Mtttii^i^ V^ 



In water hot, to keep the " rocks " 
From an untimely fall. 

On buttered tins the mixture drop 
From spoon — 'twill oddly form — 

Bake in an oven not too cold, 
Nor yet again too warm. 

Taste one when done, and you will own. 
Before you are much older. 

The only fault with such a rock 
Is that it's not a boulder.

ICE-CREAM CAKE 

Best of all 
Among the rarest of good ones. 

— Cymheline. 

Make a good sponge-cake (any book 
Will tell you how to do the trick), 

Use layer-pans in which to cook 

The batter, spread a half inch thick. 

When they are baked, set by till cold, 

Nor let impatience mar their gold. 

Then, calling all your native skill. 

Whip hard a pint of rich, sweet cream 

(Suppose it treated you so ill, 
AVhat would you think?) . Well, to my 
theme. 

Atone with sugar sifted through. 

And add vanilla extract, too. 

Next in the mass so fluffy fair 

(As 'twere a cloud from Heaven 
dropped!), 
^ Fold in with the extremest care 



One pound of almonds, blanched and 
chopped. 
This 'twixt the layers thickly pour — 
Who eats one slice will ask for more. 



Ah! willingly I would forsake 

Doughnuts, and other simple things, 

For this — the queen of ev'ry cake — 
How glad I am it has no wings! 

And yet it goes so quickly too, 

I'm sure it has them. What say you? 









NUT WAFERS 

well done I I commend your pains. 

— Macbeth. 

Here are cakes for dainty eating: 

Peanut butter, just a cup, 
In the bowl some soda meeting 

(Half a teaspoon, you take up). 

Add one cup of clear, warm water. 
Stir till paste is smooth as silk. 

Leaving not a trace, my daughter, 
Of the soda white as milk. 

Then, still beating like a Vandal, 

Mix in flour just enough 
To form dough that you can handle — 

It must be a plastic stuff. 

Knead this well with your ten fingers, 

Then cut wafers very thin, 
And where moderate heat lingers 

Is the place to bake them in. 

Let the oven do its duty. 

You'll discover by and by 
That each wafer is a beauty 

When it comes out crisp and dry. 



SPICED COFFEE CAKE 

Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. 

— Samuel Johnson. 

Sometimes it chances John will sigh 

For dainties tasted long ago, 
And should you wish to still that cry. 
And have him laud you to the sky. 
The means are duly set below. 

The usual cup of butter take, 

And just the same of sugar, too, 
Alack! how true with us who bake. 
No matter how our brains we rake, 
Repeat we must, repeat we do. 

Molasses next — rich, nutty, brown — 

One cup of this, and one as well 
Of strong, cold coffee — best in town — 
One egg, four cups of flour down. 
Into the mixture go to dwell. 

Add cup of raisins — stoned, you know — 

And baking-powder, teaspoons three. 
While cinnamon will one o'erflow. 



And cloves will e'en be measured so, 
Thus ends the ancient recipe. 



AFTERTHOUGHT 

Now if you ask how long it should 

Within the oven's arms abide? 
I cannot answer if I would, 
I only know that it makes " good," 
When the broom proves it's satisfied. 









" BETHLEHEMS " 

They are ever forrvard 
In celebration of this day. 

— Henry VIII. 

Of all the cakes that come for Christmas 

Day 
The little Bethlehems must lead the way, 
So simple, too, to make, as you will see 
If you will read this rhyme attentively. 

First butter take, about a fourth of cup, 

Then sugar — brim but once same meas- 
ure up. 

Cream these together till they're smooth 
as silk, 

And add straightway half-cup of sweet- 
est milk. 

Next sift one cup — and half one more 

— of flour 
Into the bowl — a sudden fairy shower! — 
With two teaspoons of baking-powder 

white. 
Now beat — and beat again — till all is 

light; 



=^ " ^ 



Then in the mixture fold with careful 
hand 

Whites of two eggs, whipped so they 
stiffly stand, 

And, last of all, a dash of flav'ring sweet. 

Rose, or vanilla, and the whole's com- 
plete. 



Put in star pans, but give each room to 

grow, 
And bake in oven, neither quick, nor slow ; 
Then, when the little shapes have grown 

quite cold, 
Wrap them in softest frosting smoothly 

rolled ; 

Let some the red of holly berries wear, 
While others don a sno^v\^ mantle fair, 
But white, or red, this do they clearly 

say: 
" We wish you all a Merry Christmas 

Day!"

" DIVINITY " 

Thank me for this, more than for all the favors. 
Which all too much I have hestorved on thee. 
— Two Gentlemen of Verona. 

Throughout the land in ev'ry school 

and college 
Where girls do gather, there you'll find 

this knowledge, 
Lectures and lessons may all forgotten 

be. 
But never how to make " Divinity." 
And so it chanced that, once upon a time, 
A maid, skilled in the art, gave me this 

rhyme : 

Two cups of granulated sugar, 
And one of maple sirup sweet. 

With a tablespoon of vinegar. 
And cup of water — I entreat — 

Boil these until a little hardens 
In water in a handy bowl. 

Then add a spoonful of vanilla, 
_ And from the fire take the whole. 



57 ix^^mtrn Mtttiptn \r^ 



What time this mixture has been cooking. 

Another pan near by must hold 
One cupful of same kind of sugar, 

And half a cup of water cold. 
These two together must boil until 

Your spoon a silver thread can spin, 
Then drop the mass on the stiff-whipped 
whites 

Of two fresh eggs, and beat it in. 

Next stir with this the first concoction 
(Which should by now be slightly 
cool). 
And beat till all begins to stiffen. 

Then add nut meats — two cups, the 
rule. 
Drop on waxed paper, if such your wish 
is. 
Or pour the whole into a pan. 
Tracing with deft, unerring knife-point 
Shapes that no mortal maid will ban.

COFFEE FUDGE 

Right noble is thy merit. 

— Richard II. 

Of granulated sugar take 

Two cups, full to the top, 
And one of coffee, rich and strong, 

Now mingle ev'ry drop. 

Next add some butter — golden — sweet — 

A teaspoonful (not two!) ^ 
Or, if rich cream you'd rather have, 

One tablespoon will do. 

Boil all together on the stove 
Until — mark this, I pray — 

A little beaten with a spoon 
Will stiffen right away. 

Then quickly take the saucepan off. 

But dream not labor's done. 
Call in the strength of your right arm 

And beat the mass like fun; 



Nor stop a moment till it grows 

Quite stiff, and then with speed ^- 






Stir in a cup of pecan nuts, 

Chopped fine to meet your need. 

Pour out into a buttered tin 

(The stuff will scarcely budge), 

Mark off each toothsome square with 
skill, 
And you have — Coffee Fudge !

SEA FOAM CANDY 

Fruit of the wave! Oh! dainty and delicious. 

— W. A. Croffut. 

Two cups full of sugar — light brown of 

hue — 
A tea-cup of water, added thereto. 
Must boil until done. And this is the 

test: 
Dropped in cold water a bit may be 

pressed 
Into soft shapes that will easily budge 
(Less brittle than Taffy — harder than 

Fudge) . 

Have ready — stiff whipped — the white 

of one egg. 
And pour in the sirup — slowly, I beg — 
All the time stirring with increasing 

haste. 
And adding vanilla extract to taste; 
Then beat a while longer till, very light, 
The mixture proclaims your efforts just 
L right. I 



Drop from your spoon's tip with infinite 

care, 
On paraffine paper the candy so fair. 
And each httle snowy, ghstening heap 
Will look like the Foam that crowns the 

great deep. 
The Sea's children, though, would envy 

our treat. 
Far better, I'm sure, they'd find it to eat.

PEPPERMINT DROPS 

Our intent mas at this time to move inward de- 
light. 

— Beaumont and Fletcher. 

Two cups of sugar — pulverized — 

And half a cup of water cool 
Within a pan, quite medium-sized, 

Are set to boil. This is the rule: 
That they be boiled five minutes long 
(Your spirits you can cheer with song!). 

Flavor with oil of peppermint 

(You'll have to judge by your own 
taste). 

For this there are no rules in print, 
I only caution: " Do not waste 

The essence." Since the little less 

Oft pleases more than the excess. 

Now stir the mixture till quite thick. 
And here again you use your wit, 
Then drop on paper — waxed, and slick — 

The fairy shapes as you see fit. 
If served when dinner's run its course, 
We all can dine without Remorse.

PEANUT BRITTLE 

Less noise, less noise. 

— I Henry IV. 

Two tablespoons of butter, 

Of vinegar but one, 
A cup of rich molasses — 

The list is almost done — 
Except for cup of sugar. 

Brown as a Spanish nun. 

Upon the fire these are 

Boiled, till in water cold 
The sirup cracks, then peanuts 

(Just what a cup will hold). 
Divested of their jackets, 

Are in the mixture rolled. 

Off from the stove take saucepan 

And soda — one teaspoon 
Dissolved in water — dash in, 

Then beat the stuff and soon 
Turn into pans, and set them 
^. To cool beneath the moon. ^ 

%>. 54 J^ 






CHOCOLATE CARAMELS 

Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though 
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the 
judicious grieve. 

— Hamlet. 

One cup of sugar, one also 

Molasses filled, and one of milk. 

Small spoon of butter — these, you know, 
With chocolate, grated fine as silk 

(Unsweetened, too, a quarter pound). 

Are creamed by stirring round and 
round. 

This mixture's boiled until it's done 
(Cracking in water proves that true), 

Then into buttered pans it's run 
Inch thick, or even less will do ; 

But one thing more — and all is told — 

Mark of¥ in squares when nearly cold. 










BUTTER SCOTCH 

Our old and faithful friend. 
We're glad to see you. 

— Measure for Measure. 

This candy's out of date, they say. 

Old-fashioned quite, and lacking style, 

Alas ! that f av'rites have their day — 
Well, Robbie Burns thought it worth 
while ! 

And if he failed the fact to mention, 

At least it is a Scotch invention. 

Now should you wish the sweet to make, 
These simple rules pray don't despise: 

Of sugar — brown — one cup you take, 
A piece of butter, walnut size, 

Vinegar in a teaspoon's hold. 
And half a cup of water cold. 

Boil all together patiently 

For twenty minutes, then you can 

Some flavor add — "a drappie wee — " 
Before the whole is turned in pan. 

And after that? Why, that is all, 

Except on you great praise will fall. 






STUFFED DATES 

To tell the secrets of my prison house. 

— Hamlet, 

How hard to have a heart of stone! 
But if you would that wrong atone, 
Some almonds blanch, sprinkle, when dry. 
With as fine salt as you can buy. 
And in an oven quickly brown. 
Then from the biggest dates in town 
Take out the stones, and in each bed 
Pop in a salted nut instead. 
Draw close the edges, and the whole 
In granulated sugar roll. 

(another change) 

A softer heart than that you make, 
If fine chopped peanuts you will take. 
While sweeter heart, as pure as snow. 
Is furnished by the marshmallow. 
One square of that most toothsome paste 
Makes of a date a dream to taste ; 
But do not close the edges to. 
Leave just a little white in view.

MAPLE CREAM CARAMELS 

Practice is the best of all instructors. 

— Old Maxim. 

Few ingredients, indeed, 
For these caramels you need. 
Sugar from the maple trees, 
Sweet with kiss of sun and breeze. 
Two pounds you must measure true, 
Then fresh butter — ounces two — 
And a cup of tliick, rich cream. 
Moving like a lazy stream. 

Now the sugar must be set. 
With a dash of water wet, 
On the stove to melt in haste. 
And when on the fragrant paste 
Little bubbles skim with ease. 
Pour the cream in slowly, please. 
Stir it gently — gently, pray — 
Then without the least delay- 
Add the butter, stiri'ing still 
(Ah! this candy calls for skill). 
Soon your labors will be o'er, 
Soon you'll rest and stir no more. 



i 









When the sirup brittle grows 
In water, cold as winter snows. 
Turn in pans, and when it's cool 
Mark in squares. So ends the rule.

MOLASSES CANDY 

A brittle glory. 

— Richard II. 

Take two cups of rich molasses. 
Brimming measure, I advise. 

Mix with these a cup of sugar. 

And some butter — small egg size. 

Now a tablespoon of glycerine 
With the rest is duly blent, 

To produce a magic smoothness 
Like an oil of good intent. 

Put this mixture in a kettle 

Set above a fire strong, 
Where it stays till it has boiled hard 

Five-and-twentv minutes long. 

Test as usual in iced water. 

If it snaps you know it's done. 

Stir in soda — one half teaspoon — 
And in pans the candy run.

After it has cooled a little. 
Pull until it's almost white. 

And with scissors snip in pieces — 
Each a mouthful of dehght!

SANDWICHES 

And if it please you so; if not, why so. 

— Two Gentlemen of Verona. 

The dial points at five. 

— Comedy of Errors. 






FRUIT SANDWICHES 

'Tis almost five o'clock . . . His time you were 
ready. 

— Much Ado about Nothing. 

Get a fresh loaf of baker's bread 
(The Graham loaf is to my taste), 

Cut into slices cobweb thin. 

And then prepare this simple paste: 



Take figs that over-seas do come. 

Almonds that dream of southern 
France, 

And apples that, much nearer home, 
The beauty of our land enliance. 

Put these together, one and all, 
And, with a hand as firm as fate. 

Chop into bits " exceeding small " — 
And you've a filling up-to-date. 










STRAWBERRY SANDWICHES 

'Tis deeds must win the prize. 

— Taming of the Shrew. 

Cut bread in thin and crustless rounds, 
Or oblongs — if you choose — 

And spread with butter gen'rously 
(All but the best refuse!). 

Next make a paste of strawberries 

And powdered sugar fine, 
With which each sandwich you proceed 

Most carefully to line. 

For a " pink " luncheon these are served 

With baby ribbon tied, 
Delicious to the taste, and sight. 

The honors they divide.

GRAHAM BREAD AND CHEESE 
SANDWICHES 

Pray does anybody here hate cheese? I would 
be glad of a bit. 

— Dean Srvift. 

Put the merest glow of butter 
On each sHce of Graham bread, 

Then a coating of French mustard 
Do more generously spread. 

After which — oh ! most delicious — 
Comes a layer of cream cheese, 

Stuffed with olives, chopped and num'- 
rous, 
As round honey swarm the bees.

APPLE AND NUT SAND- 
WICHES 

My custom always of an afternoon. 

— Hamlet. 

These little sandwiches for tea 

Are simple, you'll declare. 
Cut white bread very slenderly, 
And trim the edges, so there'll be 

No brown crust anywhere. 

The slices spread with butter sweet — 

A tiny, golden sheen — 
Then apple discs, so slim and neat, 
With mayonnaise, and chopped nut-meat. 

Put in the space between. 










BROWN AND WHITE SAND- 
WICHES 

Soon at five o'clock 
Please you I'll meet with you. 

— Comedy of Errors. 

Thin slices of brown bread, 

Thin sHces of white, 
Each with nut butter spread — 

The housewife's deHght! 
These alternately press 

Together with care. 
Cut into strips, and dress 

A feast anywhere. 






GINGER SANDWICHES 

Thank God for tea! What would the world do 
without tea? How did it exist? I am glad I was 
not born before tea. 

— Sidney Smith. 

Crystallized Ginger from the distant 

East, 
The kind that often tops a home-made 

feast, 
May be to other uses put. Here's one: 
Chopped fine, each morsel — gleaming 

like the sun — 
Is dipped in orange juice, then thickly 

spread 
Between thin layers of fine wheaten 

bread. 
Ah! Ginger that's "hot i' the mouth," 

'tis true 
I find you good. And so without ado 
Will Martha — cumbered with her cares 

— when she 
Has unexpected friends drop in to tea. 






NASTURTIUM SANDWICHES 

To the dominion of the Tea-table I submit. 

— Congreve. 

Slice fresh white bread and thickly 
spread 

With mayonnaise, in lieu of butter, 
Then cut each slice in circles nice — 

Using for this a biscuit-cutter. 

Take leaves that twine on nasturtium 
vine, 
Shield-like in shape, and oh! how ten- 
der — 
And place their green the bread between. 
Curling about the stems so slender. 

Then girdle round the snowy mound 
Nasturtium blossoms, fair and fra- 
grant, 

The sight complete would tempt to eat 
An appetite however vagrant.

OYSTER BALLS 

Brave conquerors — for so you are. 

— Love's Labour's Lost. 

Of sifted pastry flour, one cup. 
The yolk of one egg beaten up, 
A pinch of salt, a tablespoon 
Of oil, as gold as Han^est moon. 
Are put into the mixing-bowl, 
And water added to the whole. 
Ice-cold, and just enough to make 
A batter that will drop; then take 
And beat all well. This is the test: 
That bubbles form upon the crest. 
Into the foaming mass, I beg. 
Stir the stiff-beaten white of egg. 
And half a pint of oysters chopped. 
The mixture now is lightly dropped 
From spoon, and fried that pretty brown 
The trees put on in Richmond town. 
Serve on hot platter, where between 
Sprigs of parsley, emerald green. 
Small triangles of toast appear 
And lend the dish a further cheer.

STRAWBERRY SCRAMBLE 

Doubtless God could have made a better berry, 
but doubtless Gad never did. 

— Walton. 

The Princess said, " The snow lies white, 

And forth we mustn't ramble, 
There's not a strawberry in sight. 

But we'll have Strawberry Scramble." 
(I grieve to say her maidens choked, 

They had to hide their laughter — 
She thought they coughed, they thought 
she joked — 

She proved her words soon after.) 



She ordered up her chafing-dish, 

And all ingredients needful. 
It only seemed she had to wish. 

Her servants were so heedful! 
One tablespoon, and half again. 

Of butter, she demanded, 
Melted it in the pan, and then 

The following commanded: 

n^T ^ — ^ ^ 







Six eggs, which had been beaten up. 

Small spoon of baking-powder, 
And large of sugar, half a cup 

Of milk. Her voice rang louder: 
"What ho! some salt." Then all was 
cast 

Upon the melted butter. 
And slowly stirred till, thick'ning fast, 

Her Highness, in a flutter. 

The whole into a dish did pour, 

And duly laid for cover 
Strawberrj'^ jam, inch deep, or more — 

Fit treat for any lover. 
On ev'ry side were voices raised 

And, with no long preamble. 
Her maids in hearty accents praised 

The peerless Strawberry Scramble. 



nJT A — 



CELERY OMELETTE 

^ <ii*A that I do love to feed on. 

— Taming of the Shrew. 

Cook until soft a cup — or more — 

Of celery cut into dice, 
Drain well, and add a cup of sauce 

That's rich, and white, and ver>^ nice. 



With salt and pepper season all, 
Then make an omelette, golden 
light — 

Fold in the dressing, and you'll have 
A dish to tempt an anchorite. 






ITALIAN OYSTERS 

This treasure of an oyster. 

— Antony and Cleopatra. 

Into the chafing-dish put these: 

A teaspoonful of butter, please, 

And two of sauce called Worcestershire; 

One tablespoon of sherry clear 

Upon this mixture lightly toss. 

And one as well of Shrewsb'ry sauce ; 

While slice of lemon — not too thin — 

And pinch of salt are cast within. 

When these are bubbling o'er the blaze 

Entrancing odors, worthy praise, 

Fill ev'ry corner of the room. 

Dispelling far dyspeptic gloom. 

And now's the time to add with care — 

Well drained — a pint of oysters rare. 

Then cook the whole until you see 

The oysters curhng up with glee, 

At which, I beg, without delay 

Put out the flame, and bear away I 

The dish, for ready 'tis to pour J 

]^ 79 ^J^

On hot, crisp biscuits salted o'er. 

And guests will find these oysters — 

Well, 
More savory than tongue can tell! 










STUFFED EGGS ON ANCHOVY 
TOAST 

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you 
up. 

— Julius Caesar. 

Spread some rounds of bread with butter, 
On which put Anchovy paste, 

Forming thus a good foundation 
That will suit most any taste. 

Next, some eggs proceed to devil, 

After cutting off one end. 
These, when ready, stand on toast rounds 

(Cut end down will firmness lend). 

Over each, at time of serving, 

Pour a lot of mayonnaise. 
As the seal of all your labors 

On a dish befitting praise.

BAKED MACARONI AND OYS- 
TERS 

Ladies and Gentlemen, will you eat any oysters? 

— Dean Swift. 

Cook till quite soft in water salt 
Some macaroni slim — then halt! 
Drain well, and rinse in water cold — 
(Be sure you do just as you're told). 
Next in a buttered baking-tin 
The macaroni lay within, 
Two inches deep the structure rear, 
On which there duly must appear 
A layer thick of rich, white sauce, 
And one of oysters which, of course. 
With salt and pepper's sprinkled o'er; 
Now macaroni comes once more — 
Layer by layer you repeat 
Until the dish is full — complete. 
Put sauce and macaroni last. 
On which fine crumbs are thickly cast, 
With butter dot — then bake till brown, 
And you've a dish to please the town.

EGGS A L'AURORE 

What an excellent thing did God bestow upon 
man when he gave him a good stomach. 

— Beaumont and Fletcher. 

To make this dish the writer begs 
That you will use six hard-boiled eggs. 
Press through a colander the yolks, 
And cut the whites with skilful strokes 
In disc-like shapes. Now one yolk more, 
This time from egg, not cooked, but raw. 
You beat up light as foam, and toss 
Into a cup of thick, white sauce. 
Put this in baking-dish and drop 
The hard-boiled eggs upon the top, 
Then in the oven let it heat 
A little while, and when complete 
Serve in same dish, and you will swear 
Its likeness to Aurora fair.
