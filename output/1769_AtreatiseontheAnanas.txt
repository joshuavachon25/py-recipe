<)£"$"$ -& F fl// ife vegetable Productions intended for 
O X. alimental Food, with which the bounteoui 

■***■*■ God of Nature hath /applied Mankind, ike 
Two, which are made the Subjefl of the en r uing Trca- 
tife, have among]} us de/ervedly obtained the higheft 
Fjlimation. Tfiefe are the Melon and the Pine- 
Apple. With Refpecl to the CharaSiers of -which 
two Plants, the candid Reader may perhaps expeif 

this Place to have fomewhat more particidarly pre- 
i/ed; tko' I judged it improper to detain him with 
it in the Work itfef. 

The Melon belongs properly to the twenty- frji 
Oafs of Linnaeus, termed Moncecia, which compre- 
hends /uch Plants as have no hermaphrodite Flowers, 
but bear both male and female on the fame Plant. lis 
Place is in the tenth Order of this' Clafi called Syn- 
a 2 geneiia, - 



u Preface 

genefia, which contains fuck Plants as have their male 
Flowers furnijhed with Filaments or Stamina that 
have united Antherae. 

♦; 

The fevered Species of the Melon produce an oval 
charmeF d Fruit, divided into three Capfules, which 
tare cut into three, parts ; and full of oblong feeds. 

. The Fine, as it is ufually called by Gardeners, which 
tears this Fruit,, has long trailing Stalks, fumiflicd 
with fever al 'Tendrils . or Clafpers, and is rough and 
hairy as well as the Leaves, which are femewhat like 
Cwumber Leaves, but roun ler. The Flowers are Yd- 

* 

tow, of the fame Jhape with the leaves, but fmaller 
than the Flowers of the Cucumber. Thefe again are 
fucceeded by pr. tty large oval Fruit, which fometimes 
is divided, as it were, into feveral parts by deep 
furrows running lengthways, like the Seftions of the 
feveral Meridians impreffed upon the artificial Globe. 
jit other Times the Fruit hath its outjide covered 
with a kind of raifed Net-work. The ir\fide of it is 
ef a redijh Colour, when it is ripe, of a very plea- 
Jcnt a.td inviting Scent, and of a much fweeter Tajte 

than 



p 

To the Reader, its 

than the Cucumber is, having a great Quantity of flat 
oblong Seeds included in a moijt watery Pulp. The 
Seed is ufed in Phyfic, and is one of tlve greater cold 
Seeds, and a very common ingredient in Emtdjiom, be~ 
ing kindly cooling and obferved by Experience to be 
proper and ufeful in Fevers and ether inflammatory 
Diflempers. It alfo minifters itlief in Affettiam of 
the Bladder and Urethra, proceeding from Stone, Strart* 
gury and Heat of Urine. J. Bauhine gives an Ac- 
count of a particular Species of this Plant, which he 
calls the Melo longus, or long Melon, fcur Spans 
in Length, and incurvated like a Cow's Horn. 

Pliny the elder gives to the Fruit the Refemblance 
of a Quince, and fays that they were called Melope- 
pones : That one of them firjl grew by Chance in the 
Campania in Italy, and that the Country was Jlocked 
afterwards from the Seed which it produced. Be/ides 
the admirable Figure, Colour and Scent of this Fruit, 
he reckons it particularly wonderful that, tho 9 it does 
not hang from a Tree, as all ether Fruit of the Ap- 
pie-Kind does, but grows upon the Surface of the 

Earth,

Farth, it Jhould j/ct, when it is come to its Maturity, 
Jlart and recede from the Stalk or Stem in the ex* 

traordimry Marnier that we . Iways fee it. 

But to the Ananas or Pine-Apple, the pre- 
ference is always given by Conno'tfeurs in Tafie. 

TVs Plant is of the feventh Orier (Polygyria 
cr having many Styles) of the thirteenth Clafs, in 
the Syftem of the great Botaniji Linnsejs, termed Po- 
lyandria. The whole Clafs confijls of fuch Plants as 
bear hermaphrodite Flowers furnifhed with many F(- 
laments fixt (not to tlie Cup, but to the fiefliy hub- 
Ranee at the Head of the Faotfialk within the Cup. 
This particularly has a Flower confijllng of one Leaf, 

I which is divided into thr.e Parts, and is Funnel- 
Jl;aped. The Embryo's are produced in the Tubercles. 
Thefe afterwards become a f.efliy Fruit, full of juice. 
The Seeds, which are lodged in the Tubercles, are very 
[mall, and in a manner Kidney -Jltaped. 
Of the feveral Species of this Fruit, cultivated in 
Europe, the Reader will find a fathfaBory Account in 
the Body of the fubfequent Treatife -, fo that a further 
pefcription may be judged unneceffary here. There are

<gnd Colour of their Fruit. As any of them Jhall hap- 

pen to become common in Europe, I can only re+ 

commend it to the Public to encourage the good, and 

tejeSl the Sorts that Jhall prove indiferent. 

7he Fruit of the Pine-Apple, which undoubted!} 

furpajfes all the Fruits with which the World is at 

prefent acquainted, is produced from an herbaceous 

Plant, having Leaves fomewhat refembling tkofe of the 

Aloe, and which are for the mojl part ferrated or 

Jawed on the Edges, but much thinner, myre Jlender, and 

lefs juicy. The Fruit correffonds in Shape with the 

Cone of the Pine-Tree-, to which Circumflance it is in 
.-.■• m \ 

all Probability indebted for its Denomination. 

We now meet with it both in the Eaft and Weft 
Indies in great Plenty and of extraordinary Good* 
fiefs. But it is only of late Tears that the Plant has 
been introduced into the European Gardens, jo ast$

ceeded in the Attempt was Mr. Le Cour of Lcydea 
in Holland. This Gentleman, after having made va- 
rious expenftve efforts to little Purpofe, at length hit 9 
upon the proper MJkoJ ani Temperature, r ijing 
Fruit, which was /aid to be equal in Goodnefs and 
Flavour to that of the Weft Indies. But I can- 
not be of opinion that any exotic Fruit, raifed by Fire 
in cold climates, can be equal to that which is pro* 
duced and matured upon the natural Soil by the ge<* 
nerous warmth of the fervent Sun. However, to this 
worthy encourager of the Art of Gardening, who 
fpared neither Fains nor Cqft in the profecution of it, 
all, who are fond of the fame falutary Employment^ 
or reap the Benefit of it. are indebted for this King 
of Fruits. For tho' large Quantities of it have been 
Jince imported from our Settlements in America, it 
was from him that our Gardens in England were 
fir ft fupplieJ. And the Ai thcr of the following Trea* 
tife prefumes that he may plead fome Merit with the 
public, in having been the firft who has brought it: to 
an improved Size and excellence without thsAJfiftance

Roof behind, to the Top of the uprighr Glirs in rrax, 
there will be a Defcent of one Fool asd £2 LcJits. 

Or, it .would anfwer, and with £u&z*zlz certr 
convenience, if there was no Eikk-wcrk a: Hi oa 
the Back -Part of this Frame, bu that whclt S*ic 9 
from the Bottom to the Top, was to cooiuxof Eoajis 
nailed to two ftroog. Potts. By whkh means, when 
the Heat of the Dung or Tan, was abased ia Jlz 
Pit, it might quickly be renewed by putting a £xocg 
Lining of Horfe-Dung 00 the out-uie againft the 
Back-Part of the Frame, and railing it higher cr 
finking it lower, according to the Degree of Hsu 
which the Plants may happen to require, A further 
Caution is necefiary, that the Glafies mull be every 
wJbere over- laid, and by 00 means pjttyed at the

^Bottom of the Panes. For a ftrong Steam will natu- 
rally arife from the Heat of the Dung, which, if 
confined, would infallibly occafion large Drops to 
hang upon the Glafs. • Thefe would frequently fall 
into the Hearts of the Plants and entirely fpoil them. 
Nor is any thing fo deftru&ive to thefe tender Plants 
as an infeited Air, which would be the immediate 
confequence of fuch Confinement. 

It is alfo neceflary, for the Converiiency of cove- 
ring the glazed Roof of this Frame, to have a Sail- 
Cloth fattened to a Roll, to let down and draw up, 
which isgrenly preferable to any other Covering. 

Further obferve, that the fruiting- P'ants muft be 
fluffed, when they require a frefh Pit of Dung or 
Tan. Thev muft all be removed from under this- 
Frame: And it is very poffible that this Work may v 
become neceflary, when 1 the Severity of the Wea- 
ther may not permit them to be expofed, and you 
m-y not-have the Coveniency o( putting them under 
Shelter as they require. Henceis apparent the necef- 
fity of having another Pit, which V would recom- 
mend 



P I N E-A P PL E. , jf 

mend to be "llhade twerity-five Feet ih Length, and 
to have it parted in the middle with Boards : So that 
Drhen the Heat of one Pit is abated, the other may b& 
ready to receive them. This fpare Pit will be very' 
Serviceable for the purpofe of railing many tender 
Plants. And if you fix a Board at the Back-Part 
and Side*, it' wifl be better for your Succefnon 
Plants which are producedTrotn Crowns and Sucker^* 
if covered with Lights in the fame manner as- your 
Melons and Cucumbers- are-; tho* Ihave broughtmy* 
Sucoeflion Plants -to Perfection under my Cucurtiber 
Frames for many Years paft. The whole Work ihay^ 
then without-Bifficulty be performed, if you have Wo* 
Pit& made aecordmg to the directions here given.* 
And let your Frame be fo contrived as to Aide from* 
one Pit to the other, which may eafily be done." 

This refiduary Pit then, being full twelve Fdet ih 
Length and fix Feet in Breadth,- will hold thirty tvfro' 
fruiting Plants (that is) Four Rows, and eight in a 1 
Row ; and may be made larger or fmallcr, accord-' 
ing to the Numbfer- of fruiting Plants which you in> 
tend to have.

Having faid as nuchas is neceflary conrermng 
the Repositories adapted to your fruiting Plants ; it 
will be proper to give fome directions for preparing 
the Pit which is deftined to receive them. 

Firfl, provide Yuurlelf with Such a Quantity of 
Dung, as will be Sufficient to fill your Pit within 
fourteen Inches of the Top of your Brick-work, 
when fettled. But this Duig, before it is put into 
the Pit, fliould be well worked together, in the fame 
manner as is pracUfed for your Cucumber Bed*:. It 
will thus heat more kindly andwith more Regularity, 
than when it is thrown in without mixing. This. 
done, provide a Sufficient Quantity of Tanner's Bark 
to plunge your Pots in. But if your Situation Is fuch 
that Tanner's Bark cannot conveniently be had, you 
mult get Saw-duLt in the Room of it, which willan- 
fwer the fame purpofc : but then its Heat will abate 
much fooner than the former, and thereby oscafion; 
the Gardener the more Trouble. 1 do not therefore 
by any means recommend Saw-dutt, where Tanner's 
Bark may be had: Tan being fo extremely ufeful 

and

that it is abundantly the beft, and will continue its 
Heat much longer than any Compoft that I am yet 
acquainted with. I have indeed brought Pine- Apple* 
to Perfe6Hon many Years with Horfe-Dung only, but 
have been obliged to fhift them oftener than when 
Tan was ufed. * J;have alfo made Ufe of Tan for thtf

till it has acquired its proper warmth, before you 
venture to put your Plants into it. 
Eut if the Plants are to be reared by the benefit of 
Horfe-Dung only, neither is it proper to put that 
into the Pit too wet ; especially in the Winter-Sea- 

Ifon, when poffibly it might i-ccaficm a confiderable

on which yoUr Hopes principally depend. 
The next Point is, to be crovided with a pro*

but that which I fhall recommend, I have found by 
Experience preferable to any other, and to be the 
Cumpoft which the Pine delights in. Of this it 
h proper to have as much at firft as will ferve 
you for two or three years : Since by laying together . 
it will be much improved, and become abundantly 
more ufeful than it is when frefh-mixt.

But, if it be itfelf of. a loamy Nature, mix with

Yard, if it can be thence procured ; but if not, 
take the fame quantity of good . rotten Dung from 
your old Cucumber or Melon-Beds. Mix thefe 
well together, and turn the whole three or four 
tilries,! that it may thoroughly imbibe the Air. All 
the large clods fliould be well broken, but not fifted 
or fcreened as is the Pra<5Vice with many 5 fo (hall

than ordinary, they will require Pots of fomewhat 
a more capacious fize, tho' in genera! the fmall 
Pots are big enough. Thefe Pots at the Time of 
planting muft be filled with the above Compoff; 
taking previous Care that there be an Oyfter-Shell 
over the Hole at the bottom of each Pot, that the 
Earth may lay hollow «nd the Water pafs off freely. 
For without this precaution the Plants will rot. 
They muft not be planted too deep : For if the 
Earth fhould get between the Leaves, It would be 
detrimental to them. Neither fhould they be plant- 
ed too lhallow ; for fo they would be liable to be 
difplaced by watering or any thing elfe that might 
lightly touch them. So that Difcretion in this Arti-

to the former, at convenient diftances of Time, as th« 
feverity of the Weather fhall demand, it will main* 
lain its Heat much longer, than if the whole Quan- 
tity was to be heaped up at once, and will ftrike a 
courifhing warmth to the Plants through the Back* 
Part of the Frame. This Is much preferable to the 
Heat which is communicated by Fire, and the 
Plants thus managed require lefs Water during the 
Wimer-Seafon, than thofe which are raifed by means 
ef the Stove. 

For the better convemency of watering the Plants 
in this Frame, you fhould be furnifhed with a Tia- 
Pipe abcut five Feet in length. By means of this 
you will be enabled to reach the Pots which are pla- 
ced at the Back Part of the Frame, without break- 
ing or injuring the Leaves of thofe which ftand to 
Front. The large end of this Pipe fhould be three 
Inches and a hilf in Diameter, and half an Inch at 
.the fmall End. and fhould be turned in the fams 
XLior.cr as the Bole of a common Tobacco-Pipe i 



PFNE-APPLE. J* 

that the Water may gradually run tipoa flferth * ThS 
Pipe is preferable -for Ufc in* the Winfer-Seafbn t<* 
any Watering-Pot that can be made for the purpofe. 

Having by tbefe dhre&ion* preferred your Plant! 
to the middle of February, they (hould now be fliifted 
into Pots aboutnine Inches deep, and ten Inches in 
Diameter. This is the proper fife ef the Pots in 
which they ihcfuld be planted to produce Fruit. But 
obferve that, at. this Time of flufting them, no 
MoufcLmuft.be taken. off/ nor muft any of the Roots 
be difturbed at all, but they muft immediately be 
fet in with Care, filling the Pots with "ftefh Mould, 
as before direfted.; * 

If your Bed.be made entirely of TaA, you fhoull 
now add ai Jitde fre(h Tan to it, miiing the old and

If thefe Plants are carefully managed in this man- 
ner during the Winter-Seafon, they will begin to 
fhew their Fruit about the middle of March. And 
if any of them mould happen to fk:w Fruit ear* 
Her, they muft not be fhifred after the firft appearance 
cf it. For this cannot be done without checking 
them greatly ; the natural Conference of which will 
be, that the Fruit will be long in ripening and at 
laft fmall, and but indifferently flavoured. 

When the Fruit appears to the beans of thefe 
Plants, you fhould be careful not to water them over 
the Leaves, more efpecially when they are in Bloom. 
iFor it will prevent feveral of their Tubercles from 
/welling: And this will render the Fruit unfighxlyv

that proper Notice be taken of the white Infers 
which are found about the Pine, and which are 
always injurious if but a little neglected, and fre- 
quently deftruclive to the Plants, 

Thefe Infects are not fo Common to be met with 
upon Pines which are managed according to 
the directions here laid down, as they are upon 
fuch as are raifed in Stoves. The caufes of them 
are varioufly affigned. Very often they are brought

are imputed to the bad iiate of Healthj and by others 
to the uncleanlinefs of the Plants ; and to the laft of 
thefe perhaps the firft is owing : But from continued 
obfervation I hsve reafon to conclude that they are 
principally occafioned by the dry Air, which is 
owing to the beat of the Fire in the Stove. Thefe

the various forts, which are raifed in England, the 
Cantaleupe, tho' fpmewhat more tender than the

When the Seed is taken from the Fruit, it fhould 
be laid in the Sun and well-dried ; after which it 
Ihould be put into a Phial and clofe corked, and 
then fet in a Place which is expofed to the Sun. 
Thus the watry Part will be foon dried up, and 
they will be as good, as if they had been kept 
elfcwhere In Paper for two or three Years. Many,

theneceffary allowance for the Time of the Bung** 
working, and the Beds coming to a proper Heat ; 
that the Plants may not, when they are arrived at 
this pitch, wait for the Bed. If the Soil, where 
you make your Bed be very dry, you may now 
dig a Trench about twelve or fourteen Inches deep, 
anfwering to the length and breadth of your Frame; 
otherwife ic is always befl to make it on the plain 
furface of the Ground. You are to make this Bed 
two Feet wider than the Frame, mixing the long 
and fhort Dung well together, that it may Heat 
regularly. Let the back part be raifed half a Foot 
higher than the Front. This will give the Glafs a 
greater Slope to the Sun, and the Plants will re- 
ceive the Benefit of it. This Bed muft alfo be 
covered with Cow- Dung, as was directed for the 
o.hers, and afterwards with Mould, about three 
Inches thick, all over the Surface. 

Three Days after the Bed is made, you are to 
put about three Pecks of good Earth under the 
Centre of each Light, raifing it into a fort of an 
Hillock,

Hillock, with a defcent Hope around. Then put 
on the Lights, tilting each Light with a notched 

Stick, that the Steam of the Bed may pafs off. la

about two Days the Earth will be thoroughly warm. 
Then carefully turn the Plants out of the Pots, having

firft watered them, that the Earth may not fall 

■ 

from the Roots, and put two Plants on each Hil- 
lock ; without difturbing the ball of Earth which 
is about their Roots. If the Mould fhould appear 
dry, give them a little Water $ but not till you 
fcave taken off the chill from it, \>y fetting it on the 
Dung a few Hours before it is wanted for ufe. Nei- 
ther let it be too warm : for that would prove as 
hurtful to the Plants as the contrary Quality. It 

* * * 

*he Sun fhould fhine out, fliade them till they have 
taken frefh Root. But if the Weather prove cold 
^nd foggy while the Plants are young, tilt up the 
Lights according, to the Heat of the Bed ; and 
hang a Mat gently over that part of the Light which 
is tilted, that the Plants may at the fame time receive 
a moderate fhare of Air, and the Steam pafs off

without injury. For if the cold Air is too freely 
admitted at this Seafon, it will frequently deftroy the 
Plants : And if the Lights are kept too clofe and the 
Steam confined, the danger will be equal. For the 
Plants will imbibe an infe&ed air andfoon fhew their 
iidcnefs by the yellownefs of their appearance. 

As the Runners advance, obferve to dtfjpjfe them 
with regularity, that they may not crbfs or be en- 
tangled one with another. And as they proceed 
in Length, encourage the Roots by adding* fome 
frelh Earth around the Hillock on which the Plants 
are placed. But in doing this, be very careful not 
to. bruife the Runners, or bury any of their Leaves. 
Let the Gardener obferve particularly, not to lay 
this frefli Earth fo high as the Top or Summit of 
th^ Hillock or Eminence before- mentioned, by two 
Inches pr thereabout, that the Main Stem may be 
kept dry ; otherwife being watered, would foak to 
this principal part, and caufe it to rot. And Itet 
ii; be underftood that this Mould is not to be hid 
on aJJL at once, but at different times, as occafroa* 

may

may require. This will greatly encourage the Fibres 
and promote the growth of the Plants, and will 
fufficiently recompence the Gardener for his Trou- 
ble, who is defirous of having his Melons excel- 
lent and of rich Flavour. 

When the young Fruit begin to appear upon the 
Runners, forbear to water them, till they are grown 
to the fize of a Walnut, unlefs the Mould fliould be 
very dry indeed ; and then let them have it but fpa- 
ringly. For a little too^ much Water at this Time 
when the Fruk i&fetting, will caufe the Branches 
to {hoot with great Luxuriency, and the young 
Melons wHl be apt to drop off. For the De- 
ftruftlott of the Fruit is generally owing to the 
cxurberant quantity of , Sap which the Branches 
contain. 

At the firfl: appearance of the young Fruit, you 
will perceive abundance of Male Blofibms, I have 
feen many unexperienced Perfons pick off thefe 



to- the manifeft prejudice of the Crop. For thefe 
falls Bloflbms (as they are too Commonly fo called)

are abfolutely necefiary for the Impregnation of 
the Ovary of the fruitful Plants. And when the 
Female i$ deprived of the Farina of the Male 
Bloffoms, which is as neceflary to the Generation 
pf Plants, as the Seed of Animals is to the Pro- 
pagation of their refpe&ive Species, your expe&a- 
tion muft fail of Courfe. 

When the Bloffoms are all over, and the Fruit 
advances in Magnitude, lay a piece of Glafi or 
Tyle under each Melon, to keep it from the 
Earth. And, if the Weather fhould prove mild 
give them a good Watering. This will caufe 
them to fwell apace. And freih Air fhould be 
admitted at all opportunities when the Weather 
is f ne. 

Should yoq find the Heat of the Bed to abate 
and decline, add a frefh Lining of new Dung, as 
before directed. And it may be requifite' to re- 
peat this two or three times. For the Fruit will 
be furprifingly forwarded in a little Time by 
keeping up a proper Warmth. And when it is 

about 



MELON.. 55 

about three parts grown, turn it every four or five 
Days; that each part may receive equally the 
Benefit of the Sun. And remember, that when 
it is full grown, it muft not be watered. For 
that would confiderably retard its Ripening, and 
in a great Meafure rob it of the Richnefs of itt 
Flavour. 

Many eminent Gardeners have a Cuftom, (and 
by no means a bad one) of. placing the Fruit when 
it is full grown, upon Bricks. This has feme 
good Effe&s. For it raifes them above the Leaves, 
whereby they, are fully expofed to the Sun and 
Air, and the Stems are fecured from rotting. 

When the Melon begins to turn yellow, and 
to crack at the part which is affixt to the Stalk 
and to diffufe a fine Smell, it is then ripe and fit 
for cutting. For if it be fuffered to remain on 
the Vine a Day or two after thefe appearances, it 
w ill lofe much of its Flavour. Let it be cut in the 
Morning before the Sun fhines upon it, and kept 
in a cool place, till it is wanted for the Table*

The Place where thefe Plants ^re to be ratfed, 
fhould be well expofed to the Sun, and enclofeej. 
with Reed Hedges, Mudwalls or Pales, to break 
off the violence of the Wind. And the Frames 
wherein the Plants are to. produce their Fruity 

'i 

fhould be larger than thofe which are made Ufe 
of for the railing of Cucumbers. The fize of 
a Two-Light MELON-Frame, fhould be feven 
Feet and an half long, and four Feet and an half 
wide ; and a Three-Light one in proportion. Ths 
beft Compoft for your Plant is the following, viau 
Take one Load of loamy Earth from under the Turf 
of a good Pafture, half that quantity of good old 
Cow-Dung, and three Wheel-Barrows full of

rotten Dung from the old Cucumber or Meloh 
Beds. Mix thefe well together by ftirring, and then 
throw the whole up in a Ridge to receive the Air. 
This fhojdd be prepared three or four Months be- 
fore it is ufed. The large Clods; fhould be well 
fcroken, but it muft not be fcreened or lifted. If 
Cucumbers are to be raifed ia the fame Ground,- it 
will be necefliry to make a Divifion with a Reed- 
Hedge, Mudwall, &c, running North and Souths 
For they are apt to degenerate, when raifed toga* 
ther. Nor, for either purpofe, fhould you tread 
Or beat the Beds clofe ; but let them fettle of them* 
felves. For this will prolong the Fermentation pf 
them, and they will be the lefs fubjeft to burni 
1 have found by Experience that the mixing of 
Coal-Aihes with the Dung m)l prevent the free 
penetration of the Air and frequently ruin the beft 
Crops. The frequent flopping of the Runners wiH

Egg. Then .flop them two joints beyond the 
Fruit. 

For the convenience of watering the Plants, 
without wetting the Leaves or Fruit, place a Gar- 
den-Pot, with a fmall Hole at the Bottom, among 
the Leaves and at fome diftance from the principal 
Stem. Put a little Hay or Grafs at the Bottom of 
it, that the Water may not pafs through too freely 
to wafh the Mould from the Roots : Removing the 
Pot difcretionally to any part of the Bed which 
may require Water. For this is abundantly better 
than making a Drill, as is the common Pra&ice, 
around the infide of the Bed. 

Some Perfons raife their principal Crop of 
Melons under Bell or Hand-Glaffes, and oiled 
Paper: For which the following particular Di- 
rections are neceflary. 

About the third or fourth of March, prepare the 
Dung as before directed for the Plants raifed under 
J-ights. Spw your Seed about the twelfth of the fame

Month. And when they have one fmall rough 
Leaf, plunge them in fmall Pots in a frefh Bed; 
where they are to remain till the Beginning of 
•April. Then the Dung muft be got in readinefs by 
mixing and-preparing it, as before dire&ed, in a 
heap to ferment ; and the Ground muft be got ready, 
where the Ridges are to be made, by ftraining 
a Line and digging a Trench three Feet wide and 
fix Inches deep, and leaving a Space of fevea 
Feet between each Trench. The Length muft 
of courfe be proportioned to the number of Gla£- 
fes, which you intend to have in each Row 5 which 
muft be full fix Feet apart. Then wheel your 
Dung into the Trench, allowing eight Barrows of 
Dung to each Hole. 

Your Dung Bed being made ftreight on the 
Sides and level pn the Top, it muft be covered 
with, Gow-Dung two Inches thick : Then fpread 
two Inches of good Mould all over the Bed, Now 
put the Glaffes upon the proper Spots, where 
the Plants are to be placed, that they may draw

of Earth at a Time from the Compoft (made as be* 
.fore dire&ed for the early Crops) and lay it on 
thofe Spot* fourteen Inches thick* Into this the 
Plants are to be remoyed about three Days af- 
terwards. 

In about three Days therefore water the Plants ia 
the Pots, that the Earth may cling to the Roots. 
Then turn them out gently and plant them under 
fhe Glafies, where they are to remain for Fruiting. 
Jfe fur* . to keep them watered, and (haded from 
{lie Sun* till they have taken frefli Root. After 
thisy Care muft be taken to give them frefh A^ 
in the Heat of the Day. This will prevent the 
Leaves from being fcorched. And, as the Plants 
advance in Growth, the Bed muft be earth'd up 
irkh the Mould between the Ridges rauct with fame 
of the Compoft, till it is almoft as high as the little 
Hills whereon the Plants grow. 

In the beginning of May, if the Heat of the 
lUdges or Beds abate, and the Nights continue calck

Tate the Mould from the Sides of the Beds^ai 
deep as the Bottom of the Dung. Then add a frefli 
lining of New Horfe-Dung, and cover it agaia 
with the Mould taken from the Sides. 

As the Plants encreafe in Growth fo as to pufl* 
againft the Sides of the Glafs, get fome Reed or 
Mofs, and lay it all over the furface of the Bed, for 
the Vines to run upon, and to preferve the Eantr 
from drying too faff. 

When the Plants are grown fb large that they 
cannot be contained under the Bell or Hand-G!a£- 
fes, they fhould then be covered with Paper Frames 
made fWl five Feet and an half wide. Aftcf ontsr 
king off the Glafles, fee that the Braae&eaTky reg«N 
larly and without being entangled with each othet 
before you put on the Frames. 

When the Bed$ are* thy* coveted with oiled Pa-* 
per Frames, the'Paths between them lhould be filled 
up with Mould as high as the Beds. 

For the convenience of watering thefe Plants, a 
deep Drill fhould be drawn with a Hoe, clofejto

the outfiefe of the Frames ; and when they require 
Water, pour it into thefe Drills, that the Fibres may 
lave the Benefit of it, without jour wetting the 
Leaves or Branches. 

Cover them in cold Nights, heavy Rains, and 
bluftering Winds ; that the Frames may not be 
blown off, or the Branches difplacecL But when 
the Weather is mild, moderate Air will be very 
ferviceable to them, and then die Frames are to 
be tilted with a forked Stick 

With refpe& to other Articles thefe differ not 
from thofe which are raifed under Lights. It 
would therefore be fuperfluous, to trouble the Rea~ 
der with a Repetition of them.
