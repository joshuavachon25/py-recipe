" Invalid Cookery should form the basis of every trained 
nurse's education.'''' 

A good sick cook will save the digestion half its work. 

Florence Nightingale 

The careful preparation of food is now recognized to be 
of vital importance to an invalid, and a valuable assist- 
ance, in many cases, to the physician, in hastening the 

recovery of a patient.

PREFACE. 



" Food is the only source of human power to work or to 
think." 



'T^HIS work is designed to meet the demands made 
■*■ upon me by the numberless classes of trained 
nurses whom" it has been my pleasure and privilege 
to instruct during my thirteen years of service as a 
teacher of cookery. 

It is earnestly hoped that, besides meeting this long 
felt need, it will do a still broader work in thousands 
of homes throughout the land, where it will be of in- 
estimable help to the mothers upon whom so much 
of the welfare of the family depends. 

The opening chapters are equally valuable to those 
who care for the sick and those who see in correct 
feeding the way of preventing much of the illness 
about us. 

Emphasis has been laid on the importance of diet 
from infancy to old age. The classification, compo- 
sition, nutritive value, and digestibility of foods have 
been carefully considered with the same constant pur- 
pose of being a help to those who arrange dietaries. 
The chapter on infant feeding is an authoritative 



yiii PREFACE. 

guide to aid in the development of the baby, while 
child feeding is considered with like care. Consid- 
erable matter has been introduced with reference to 
diet in various diseases, and the recipes for the die- 
betic have involved much thought and labor. 

The hundreds of thoroughly tested recipes cover 
the whole range of the subject of cookery for the sick 
and convalescent. They are, for the most part, indi- 
vidual, thus requiring but a minimum of time for 
their preparation, while many have their caloric value 
given. 

I wish to express my sincere thanks for the sym- 
pathy, encouragement, and help I have received from 
pupils, superintendents of nurses, professors, and 
physicians, which have made this work possible.

FOOD AND COOKERY 

FOR THE 

SICK AND CONVALESCENT. 



CHAPTER I. 
POOD AND ITS RELATION TO THE BODY. 

FOOD is that which builds and repairs the body, and 
furnishes heat and energy for its activities. Meta- 
bolism includes the processes by which food is assimi- 
lated and becomes part of the tissues, and the excretion 
of broken-down tissues as waste products. The body, 
by the analysis of its different organs and tissues, is found 
to contain from twenty to twenty-five chemical elements, 
of which the principals are : carbon (C), 21^% ; hydrogen, 
(H), 10%; oxygen (O), 62|%; and nitrogen (N), 3%. 
Phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), chlorine (CI), 
fluorine (Fl), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sodium (Na), 
magnesium (Mg), and silicon (Si) are some of the others 
present. The elements found in the body must be sup- 
plied by the oxidation and utilization of the food stuffs, 
and the health of the individual will suffer if these are 
not properly maintained. 

Food adjuncts are such substances as stimulate the 
appetite without fulfilling the requirements of food. Ex- 
amples : tea, coffee, spices, flavoring extracts, condiments, 
etc., etc. 

While air is not classified as a food, it is essential to life. 
Combustion cannot take place without it, and all food 
must be oxidized (which is a process of slow combustion) 
before it can be utilized by the body.

Prof. W. 0. Atwater. 



The chief office of proteins 1 is to build and repair tis- 
sues, and they only can do this work. And this is true 
only of the albuninoids. The body cannot appropriate 
nitrogen of extractives or gelatin. Gelatin acts as a tissue 
sparer rather than builder. Proteins also furnish heat 
and energy, and in cases of emergency are capable of 
supplying fat. The chemical elements found in protein 
foods are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, 
and generally phosphorus and iron. They differ from the 
other food principles inasmuch as they contain nitrogen, 
around which all chemical reactions centre, and nitrogen 
is essential to life. 

The principal animal proteins are meat, fish, eggs, 
and cheese ; the principal vegetable proteins are cereals, 
peas, beans, and lentils. The proteins obtained from ani- 
mal foods are more easily digested and more completely 
absorbed than those obtained from vegetable foods. This 

1 Protein is a comprehensive term which includes all nitrogenous 
substances and is used as a synonym for proteid. 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 3 

is due in part to the presence of the large quantity of 
cellulose in vegetables. During the oxidation of proteius 
ammonia is set free, which neutralizes the acids constantly 
being formed. 

The waste products of proteins are excreted by the 
urine in the form of urea. A well-balanced dietary con- 
tains all the food principles in correct proportions to the 
needs of the individual. It is possible to sustain life 
on proteins, mineral matter, and water, provided a large 
quantity of water is drunk. 

Proteins are the most expensive foods, and there is often 
found to be an insufficient quantity in dietaries, especially 
among the poorer classes. It is conceded to be true, 
that in the United States with those of large incomes 
there is an excessive use of proteins. There is a growing 
tendency among those who have given the subject the most 
atteution to decrease the amount in the daily dietary. The 
actual requirement of protein necessary for the best of 
health is still a question for discussion. Atwater allows 
125 grams daily for a man doing an average amount of 
work, Voit 100 to 120 grams, while according to Chitten- 
den's theory from 40 to 60 grams is sufficient. The result 
of Chittenden's work has not met with general approval, but 
sufficient time has not elapsed for clinicians to discredit it. 
Between 75 and 118 grams is now generally conceded to 
be sufficient to meet all requirements. The body does not 
store up nitrogen except as used for the building of new 
tissues. Consequently when protein foods are taken in ex- 
cess (being complicated in structure) much energy is re- 
quired to break them up into the simpler compounds, the 
kidneys are overtaxed, and a poisonous irritating action in 
circulation is produced. Our people eat more than any other 
people, and do correspondingly more work. The grow- 
ing child suffers more from the lack of protein than the 
adult, as much material is required for building as well as re- 
pair. Until recently it was supposed that metabolism went 
on much faster in young cells, but now the greater activity 
of the child is held responsible for these rapid changes. 



4 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The chief office of carbohydrates is to furnish heat and 
energy and store fat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen, the hydrogen and oxygen always being in 
the proportion to form water (H 2 0). 

Starch, the chief source of carbohydrates, abounds 
throughout the vegetable kingdom, being obtained from 
seeds, roots, tubers, stems, and pith of many plants. 
Examples : cereals, potatoes, sago, tapioca, etc. 

Sugars, the other source from which carbohydrates are 
obtained, are classified as follows : — 

/"Cane sugar (Sucrose). 
Sucroses I Beet sugar. 

(Disaccharids) -J Maple sugar. 

C 12 H2 2 1 i I Malt sugar (Maltose). 

VMilk sugar (Lactose). 

Glucoses f Grape sugar (Dextrose). 

(Monosaccharids) • ) Fruit sugar (Lsevulose). 
C 6 H 12 6 ( Invert sugar (Honey best example)- 

Hutchison. 

Carbohydrates include the cheapest kinds of foods and 
are apt to be taken in excess in institutions where large 
numbers are fed. They give variety and ballast, and are 
the best absorbed of all compounds. 

Carbohydrates in the form of starch furnish a bulky 
food ; and while a certain amount of bulk is necessary, 
an excess causes gastric disorders. Sugar is oxidized and 
absorbed more readily than starch. The monosaccharids 
are ready for absorption, dextrose being the sugar found 
in the blood. Some sugar is absorbed through the walls 
of the stomach, and this holds true of no other foods ex- 
cept alcohol and a very small per cent of peptones (pro- 
teins), Practically no water is absorbed through the walls 
of the stomach. 

Sugar (sucrose), on account of its cheapness and com- 
plete absorption when taken in combination and mod- 
eration, makes a desirable quick-fuel food. Milk sugar 
(lactose) is equal in nutritive value to cane sugar. Being 
less sweet to the taste and more slowly absorbed, it is 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 5 

often used to advantage for infant feeding aud sick-room 
cookery, where expense is not considered. The usual 
retail price of milk sugar is about thirty cents per pound. 
Milk sugar, under ordinary conditions, does not ferment 
and give rise to an excess of acids. 

Sugars are more rapidly oxidized than starches. The 
former may be compared to the quick flash of heat from 
pine wood, the latter to the longer-continued heat from 
hard wood.

Showing how proteids, fats, and carbohydrates are split up in 
the body. 

The starches furnish the necessary bulk to our foods 
and are also protein sparers. Proteins give such an in- 
tense heat that but for the starches much of their energy 
would be wasted. 

The waste products of carbohydrates are carbon dioxid 
(C0 2 ) and water (H 2 0), which leave the body through the 
lungs, skin, and urine. 

The fats and oils also furnish heat and energy, and 
constitute the adipose tissue of the body. Examples: 
Fats of meat, butter, cream, olive oil, etc. They are an 
expensive concentrated fuel wood, yielding two and one- 
fourth times as much energy as an equal weight of car- 
bohydrates. To those who do not consider expense in 



6 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

feeding, there is a strong tendency to increase the use 
of fats and oils and decrease the carbohydrates, while 
in many respects they are interchangeable. " In the diet 
of children, at least, a deficiency of fat cannot be replaced 
by an excess of carbohydrate ; and that fat seems to play 
some part in the formation of young tissues which can- 
not be undertaken by any other nutritive constituent of 
food," is a prevailing belief among competent observers. 

Carbohydrates (except small amounts in combination 
with nitrogen) and fats do not become integral parts of body 
cells. Fat is not deposited as fat in the protoplasm itself. 

Water constitutes about two-thirds of the weight of the 
body, and enters into the composition of all the tissues 
and fluids. To keep the necessary proportion, a large 
quantity needs to be ingested. One of the great dietetic 
errors is the neglect to take a sufficient quantity. The 
amount found in foods is insufficient, and about five cup- 
fuls should be taken daily in beverages. A vegetable diet 
diminishes the need of water, while one composed largely 
of animal food increases this need. 

Mineral matter is necessary for the building of tissues, 
being found, principally, in the bones and teeth. It aids 
in the digestion of foods, and also assists in the diffusion 
of the fluids of the body. Phosphate of lime, or calcium 
phosphate, is the mineral basis of bones. Potassium, 
magnesium, sodium, and iron are minerals, all of which 
are essential to life. They usually enter the body in 
organic compounds. Sodium chloride (NaCl), common 
salt, is found in all tissues and secretions of the body 
except the enamel of the teeth. A sufficient quantity is 
obtained from our foods for the body's need : the average 
person, however, takes an additional quantity as a condi. 
ment, thus stimulating the appetite and increasing the 
flow of gastric juice. 



ESTIMATES OF FOOD VALUES. 



CHAPTER II. 
ESTIMATES OP FOOD VALUES. 

THE familiar comparison between the body and the 
locomotive engine serves as a most forcible illustra- 
tion for studying the fuel value of foods. 

Food furnishes fuel to supply heat and energy for the 
body as wood and coal do for the locomotive. The food 
not only does this work, but it must also build and repair 
the human structure, while the locomotive is not capable 
of making its own repairs. 

Latent beat is just as surely found in meat or bread as 
in wood or coal. They are both waiting to be oxidized, 
that they may be converted into heat and energy. As 
different kinds of wood and coal are capable of giving off 
different degrees of heat, and also giving off that heat in 
longer or shorter periods of time, so different food stuffs 
work in comparatively the same way. 

The subject of the fuel value of food is of such great 
importance that within the last few years much time has 
been devoted to experiments along this line, and the 
results have furnished much valuable knowledge to aid 
us in correct feeding. 

The latent energy in different foods has been deter- 
mined by their oxidation, outside the body, in the ap- 
paratus known as the bomb calorimeter. Still further 
experiments have been made with the respiration calo- 
rimeter. By this apparatus not only is the fuel value 
of all the food taken into the body determined, but the 
excreta, products of respiration, and heat given off by 
the body are measured. From this statement it can be 
seen that man himself is used in making the experiments. 



8 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Results have shown that the oxidation of foods is the 
same in the body as outside the body. 

"The amount of heat given off in the oxidation of a 
given quantity of any material is called its ' heat of com- 
bustion,' and is taken as a measure of its latent or 
potential energy." The calorie is the unit measure of 
beat used to denote the energy-giving power of food, and 
is equivalent to the amount of heat necessary to raise one 
kilogram of water 1° C. or about one pound of water 4° F. 

1 gram x proteid furnishes 4 calories 

1 " carbohydrates furnishes 4 " 

1 " fat 2 furnishes 8.9 " 

Bulletin No. 142 U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
1 gram alcohol furnishes 7 calories 

While proteins are capable of furnishing heat and 
energy as well as building and repairing tissues, it must 
always be remembered that their chief office is for the 
latter work. It is impossible for metabolism to go on 
without the production of some heat. The proteins are 
the only foods that contain nitrogen. 

To determine the amount of nitrogen in a given food 
stuff, divide its grams of protein by 6.25. One gram 
nitrogen equals 6.25 grams protein. The excretion of 
nitrogen for a man of average weight is about twenty 
grams daily, the same amount being consumed. When 
the quantity of nitrogen is increased, there is a corre- 
sponding increase of its excretion, thus establishing 
nitrogenous equilibrium. 

1 28.3 grams equal 1 oz. 

2 In estimating the caloric value of fats for the sake ofconvenience, 
1 gram is considered as yielding 9_calories. 



ESTIMATES OF FOOD VALUES. 



How to determine the Caloric Value of any Food. 

It is necessary to know the percentages of protein, fat, 
and carbohydrate to determine the caloric value * of any 
food. With such percentages at hand in one hundred 
grams, by moving the decimal point two places to the left, 
is found the value of one gram. Multiply this amount by 
the number of grams called for ; then multiply the pro- 
tein and carbohydrate by four and the fat by nine.

12 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

A man of average weight (one hundred and fifty-four 
pounds, or seventy kilos), at moderate work, requires 
about three thousand calories daily. The standard diet- 
aries include one hundred and eighteen grams protein, fifty 
grams fat, and five hundred grams carbohydrates. 

Protein 118 grams X 4 = 472 calories 

Carbohydrates 500 " X 4 = 2000 " 

Fat 50 " X 9 = J150 " 

Total caloric value 2922 "

A woman needs eight-tenths as much food as a man. 

The quantity of food required in a temperate and warm 
climate is about the same; the kinds, however, vary. 
Mother Nature, always wise and unerring, produces differ- 
ent crops to meet different needs. In our own country 
oats is grown in the northern part, rice in the southern. 

In a cold climate more food is needed, — a fact not due 
to the temperature, but to the greater activity of the 
inhabitants, — and fat forms a larger proportion of the 
diet, as it is oxidized slowly in the body. 

A tall, thin person consumes more food than a short, 
stout person, for the reason that the larger surface ex- 
posed is the cause of a greater loss of heat. 

Age has a marked effect upon the rations needed. A 
child from three to five years old requires four-tenths as 
much food as a man at moderate work ; from six to nine 
years, one-half as much; while a boy of fifteen years 
requires as large a quantity as a man of sedentary 
habits. 

The abuses of diet in youth are responsible for much 
Buffering which develops later in life. The laws of ite-

tributive justice may be slow, but are, nevertheless, sure. 
Again, many of the diseases which occur after middle life 
are due to the habit of eating and drinking such foods 
as were indulged in during the early years of vigorous 
manhood. 

In advancing years, when growth has ceased and ac- 
tivity has lessened, food is oxidized more slowly ; there- 
fore, a smaller quantity is required, and that in a form 
to be easily digested. 

In arranging menus for individuals or families, per- 
sonal idiosyncrasies must be considered. It is a homely 
saying, but true, that, " Oue man's meat is another man's 
poison." 

The "Dietary Computer," by Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, 
is of great value to one whose desire it is to make out 
bills of fare according to food values. By its use money 
spent for foods could be used to better advantage, fami- 
lies would be better nourished, and disease would be less 
frequent. 

Experience has taught when it is best to eat, and what 
to eat. 

Nutrition depends upon digestion, absorption, and as- 
similation. In health they work harmoniously. In disease 
where one is disturbed the others are affected. 



14 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

CHAPTER III. 
DIGESTION. 

FOOD, before it can be utilized by the body, must un- 
dergo many mechanical and chemical changes to 
render it capable of digestion, absorption, and assimila- 
tion. 

Digestion is the conversion of insoluble and indiffusible 
substances into soluble and diffusible substances capable 
of being absorbed. Absorption is the taking up of the 
digested food by the blood-vessels and lymphatics and 
conveying it to the blood, by which it is carried to every 
part of the body. Assimilation is the taking up by the 
different tissues from the blood such material as they need 
for growth and repair. 

Digestion is carried on principally by ferments, and 
these act by contact. Food is taken into the mouth, 
masticated by the teeth, moistened by the saliva, and 
coated by the mucin in the saliva, which makes it easy to 
swallow. The saliva is an alkaline fluid secreted by three 
pairs of glands, — the parotid, submaxillary and sub- 
lingual. Ptyalin, which acts in an alkaline medium, is 
the ferment found in the saliva. It has the power of 
changing starch to maltose and dextrose, but has no effect 
on proteids or fats. The flow of saliva is continuous, but 
greatest during eating, about three pints being secreted 
every twenty-four hours. 

Thorough mastication is very important, that the food 
may be finely divided before passing on into the alimen- 
tary canal. If not well masticated it is retained in the 
stomach for too long a time, thus favoring the develop- 
ment of bacteria, which give rise to acid fermentation. 

The stomach normally contains few if any bacteria as 
they do not thrive where there is great activity or in an 
acid medium. 



DIGESTION. 15 

Food is forced by peristaltic action through the oesopha- 
gus into the cardiac portion of the stomach, where it conies 
in contact with the gastric juice. The gastric juice is a 

fluid which contains hydrochloric acid (HC1) and three 
ferments (enzymes), pepsin, remain and lipase. The flow 
of gastric juice is intermittent, but about the same quan- 
tity is secreted, daily, as of saliva. 

Pepsin acts upon proteid foods, changing some to al- 
bumoses and peptones, while by far the largest part is 
simply swollen in gastric digestion. Pepsin is the prin- 
cipal ferment which acts upon gelatin. Bennin is a 
milk-curdling ferment, lipase is a fat-splitting ferment 
recently discovered. 




Cut showing the division of the stomach into two portions. 

The digestion of starch continues for about one-half 
hour after entering the stomach ; by that time the food 
material is sufficiently mixed with the gastric juice to 
render the whole acid, thus destroying the alkaline reac- 
tion. A certain amount of cane sugar is inverted (broken 
up into dextrose and luevulose) by the hydrochloric acid 
in the stomach. Fats are set free, and to some extent 
melted in the stomach. About six per cent of proteins, 
twenty per cent of sugar, and some salts are absorbed 
through the walls of the stomach. Water passes on with 
the partially digested food. If the food is liquid, the 



16 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

water leaves the stomach very quickly, and in drinking 
water some leaves the stomach before the last swallow is 
taken. 

The stomach plays a very important part in digestion : 

1. Mechanical: 

It acts as a reservoir and it reduces food to a liquid or 
semi-solid consistency. Both are very essential. 

2. Chemical : 

The. actual digestion by chemical means is compara- 
tively slight, but it is possible that the products of stomach 
digestion (chemical products) are important in stimulating 
the mechanical and chemical processes in the rest of the 
digestive tract 

The stomach has two muscular motions. The first is 
a turning movement, which takes place in the larger or 
cardiac portion, mixing the food with the gastric juice, 
thus bringing the whole to a semi-fluid consistency. 

The second is a wave-like movement which takes place 
in the pyloric end, by means of which the food is allowed 
to pass by intervals into the duodenum, which is the 
entrance to the small intestine. 

The juice poured out in the pyloric portion contains 
no hydrochloric acid, but is neutral or slightly alkaline ; 
pepsin is present. 

The quantity of gastric juice varies not only in differ- 
ent individuals, but in the same individual according to 
the diet. Extremes in temperature exert an influence on 
gastric digestion. Pawlow has made many very interest- 
ing experiments along this line, and has discovered that a 
diet composed chiefly of meat produces a large flow of 
gastric juice poor in ferments ; bread produces a small 
flow of gastric juice rich in ferments; while milk produces 
a moderate flow of gastric juice and a moderate amount 
of ferments. To keep in good normal condition without 
gain or loss of body weight, a plain, wholesome, mixed 
diet is the most satisfactory. 

There is great danger, especially in the young, of be- 
coming addicted to digestive habits. Each food calls 



DIGESTION. 17 

forth a, special gastric juice, and if the diet is limited to a 
few foods the power to assimilate others becomes lessened ; 
therefore if the diet is increased, gastric disturbances are 
apt to occur. When a patient has been kept for some time 
on a milk diet, other foods must be introduced gradually, 
and in small quantities, for the comfort of the individual. 

The stomach being capable of great distension, often 
gives rise to the taking of too much food at a single time. 
Three meals daily meet the needs. of the average person. 
Dinner should be the heartiest meal, and should be served 
after the work of the day is over, when suflicient time 
may be allowed for eating, which may be followed by 
rest. 

In cases of impaired digestion, fifteen or twenty minutes 
is recommended for rest after each meal. Where a light 
breakfast is taken, a lunch should be indulged in in the 
middle of the forenoon. There are frequently found 
people of small stomach capacity who seem to require 
food at frequent intervals in small quantities ; whereas if 
a meal is taken which would serve the needs of the 
average person, gastric disturbances follow. 

Appetite has a marked effect on gastric digestion, and 
it is often necessary to stimulate the appetite. Attractive 
surroundings (plants, flowers, music, singing birds, etc.) 
are provided in institutions where money is not the first 
consideration. The sanitariums and hospitals in Ger- 
many are far in advance of ours in this respect. Good 
cooking plays a far more important part than surround- 
ings, and it is the duty of the cook to stimulate the appe- 
tite by appealing to the sense of hearing, smell, sight, 
and taste. 

The digestibility of foods is calculated by the length of 
time they remain in the stomach. The average meal leaves 
the stomach in about four or five hours. The following 
table will be found of value in considering the ease or 
difficulty with which certain foods are digested.

Digestion principally takes place in the small intestine. 
The stomach acts as a reservoir for food, and plays a 
very important part, although instances are recorded 
where people have been well nourished after the removal 
of the stomach. There was, however, a radical change in 
the diet, the food being taken in a liquid or semi-solid state. 

Food in the small intestine comes in contact with two 
fluids, — the pancreatic juice and the bile (which is poured 
out from the liver), both of which are alkaline fluids. 
The flow of pancreatic juice is suspended except during 
digestion, while the flow of bile is constant but greatest 
during digestion. 

The pancreatic juice contains four ferments, — amylop- 
sin, trypsin, steapsin, and invertin. 

Amylopsin acts upon starches and completes their 
digestion. Trypsin completes the digestion of proteins.

It8 action is similar to the action of pepsin in the gastric 
juice, but it is able to act in an alkaline medium. The 
proteins which were simply swollen in the stomach are 
now penetrated by this juice and their digestion is com- 
pleted. Steapsin splits the fats into glyceri*2 and fatty 
acids. The fatty acids combine with an alkgune solution 
aud form soap. The bile salts also plq^Bn important 
part in the digestion of fats, but afreet neither proteins 
nor carbohydrates. They, too, combine with fatty acids 
to form soap, and soap forms an emureion. Fats thus 
emulsified are ready for absorption. Invertin acts upon 
cane sugar, changing it to levulose aud dextrose. 

The action of micro-organisms is going on all the time 
in the intestines. Proteins are decomposed by bacterial 
action and carbohydrates fermented which gives rise to 
acids and gases. 

The liver acts as a storehouse for the body, to be 
called upon as needed. Some of the carbohydrates 
which during digestion have been converted into sugar, 
on reaching the liver are changed into glycogen, and 
glycogen is reconverted into sugar before* entering the 
general circulation. 

The digested food is now ready for absorption, although, 
as has been stated, the digestion of all foods need not be 
completed before the absorption of some foods take place. 
For example, alcohol, sugar, and some proteins and salts 
are absorbed in the stomach. Liquids are the first to 
leave the stomach, then carbohydrates, proteins, and fats 
in the order given. 

White of egg (albumen) and skim milk as they require 
so little stomach digestion are the most quickly absorbed 
of protein foods. 

Food is moved along from the small to the large intes- 
tine by peristaltic muscular contraction. Absorption of 
food occurs almost entirely in the small intestine, and for 
the most part in the upper part. By the time the intes- 
tinal contents have reached the caecum practically all the 
nutritive portion has disappeared. 



20 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Bile salts, on account of their great value, are nearly 
absorbed before reaching the rectum, and are used over 
and over again. Salts, bile pigments, connective tissue, 
and cellulose are not digested (although some authorities 
affirm that the cellulose in young vegetables is partially 
digested) ; these, with the waste products of metabolism, 
are excreted through the rectum as faeces. 



FOOD AND HEALTH VERSUS DRUGS AND DISEASE. 21 



CHAPTER IV. 

FOOD AND HEALTH VERSUS DRUGS AND 
DISEASE. 

T^R. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES is reported to 
*-J have said, " I can count on the fingers of one hand 
the drugs commonly used by the general practitioner." 
Drugs are used at the present time to a less extent, and 
administered in smaller doses, than ever before. The phy- 
sician of to-day knows that the recovery to health from 
disease is a natural process, and administers drugs to assist 
nature rather than to effect a cure. The study of foods 
and their effect on the individual is of equal importance 
to the study of drugs. 

All infectious diseases are due to bacterial action. 
Germs enter the system in different ways. 

1. Through the gastro-enteric tract. 

2. Through the air passages. 

3. Through the skin, cuts, etc. 

4. Through the genito-urinary system. 

Drugs do not .kill bacteria; exception must be made, 
however, to the valuable discovery of anti-toxins, which 
have done so much for the advancement of medical 
science. 

The healthy person is constantly coming in contact 
with disease germs, but he is immune from the disease of 
which they are the cause, as anti-toxins are constantly 
being formed within the body which neutralize the poison- 
ous effects of the germs. 

Health may be defined as a sound mind in a sound 
body. The necessary conditions for health are : — 

1. A correct supply of food. 

2. The proper cooking of same. 



22 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

3. Air and sunlight supply. 

4. Good environment. 

5. Exercise. 

6. Rest. 

7. Sleep. 

8. Bathing. 

It is safe to state that two-thirds of all disease is 
brought about by errors in diet, — either the food prin- 
ciples have not been properly maintained or the food has 
been improperly cooked. To one accustomed to visiting 
children's hospitals, or children's wards in general hos- 
pitals, this statement cannot seem an exaggeration, as 
the results of mal-nutrition are everywhere in evidence. 
Correct feeding should begin at birth, and continue through 
childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. Children more 
readily succumb to disease than older people ; herein lies 
the necessity of paying the strictest attention to their 
nourishment and care. 

" I have come to the conclusion that more than half the 
disease which embitters the middle and latter part of life 
is due to avoidable errors in diet, . . . and that more mis- 
chief in the form of actual disease, of impaired vigor, and of 
shortened life accrues to civilized man ... in Eugland and 
throughout central Europe from erroneous habits of eating 
than from the habitual use of alcoholic drink, considerable 
as I know that evil to be." — Sib Henry Thompson. 

The effect of foods on metabolism is a subject which 
has received much attention during the last fifty or sixty 
years. " Metabolism is the sum of the chemical changes 
within the body, or within any single cell of the body, by 
which the protoplasm is either renewed or changed to per- 
form special functions, or else disorganized and prepared 
for excretion." 

As early as the seventeenth century the idea was ad- 
vanced that food furnished the necessary fuel for the 
body, but this theory attracted but little attention and 
seemed to be of almost no practical value as an aid to 
better living. 



FOOD AND HEALTH VERSUS DRUGS AND DISEASE. 23 

Towards the close of the eighteenth century oxygen 
was discovered by Priestley, which explained the process 
of combustion, which he believed to take place in the 
animal organism as well as outside the body. Liebig 
made valuable advances in the study of metabolism, and 
later investigations have verified the truth of his state- 
ments. In 18-10 he published a dietary study which, 
from the standpoint of modern work, on account of its 
incompleteness, is of but little value. Still it was a 
pioneer publication which gave much assistance to many 
of his followers. 

From 1850 to 1870 many experiments were made along 
these lines with animals, including cattle, dogs, and sheep. 
In 1865 and 1866 Voigt and Pettenkofer published the 
results of many experiments which they had made on man. 
To Voigt and his follows should be given the credit of the 
most valuable work of recent years. 

Thorough work of a very high order has been done in 
Russia from which much accurate knowledge has been 
gained. The name of Van Noorden stands out promi- 
nently on account of his work on metabolism. Japan, 
Italy, Sweden, and England have all furnished students 
who have aided science along this line. As Americans 
we are especially proud of that which has been done in 
our own country. Chittenden and Flint have been earnest 
workers, and more accurate results are being obtained 
each year at the expense of our own government, under 
the able direction of Professor Atwater. 

In the latest experiments account is taken of all food 
consumed, the excretory products, and the total energy 
manifested during the experiment, as heat or muscular 
work. The ideal has not as yet been reached, as no ac- 
count has been made of body gain or loss, or the energy 
stored or transformed during the experiment.

CHAPTER V. 
INFANT FEEDING. 



IT would seem that every child's birthright should be a 
healthy mind in a healthy body, but man is not yet 
wise enough and science has not opened its doors suffi- 
ciently wide to render perfect living possible. Still search- 
ing for new truth, each year adds its part towards the 
complete solution, and " It is a proper or improper nutri- 
ment which makes or mars the perfection of the coming 
generation." 

The power of the baby to grow mentally and physically 
must depend chiefly on its feeding, — although air and 
sunlight supply, environment, rest, sleep, exercise, bath- 
ing, and clothing all play a part not to be overlooked. 

A young baby is a young animal, and must eat, sleep, 
and use some muscular effort in kicking and crying (at 
least one-half hour each day), to expand the chest 
and gain strength. A baby should be handled but little, 
and kept as quiet as possible. Much sleep is necessary, 
for during sleep the child develops and grows. For the 
first month a child requires sleep from twenty to twenty, 
two hours daily; three months, eighteen to twenty 
hours ; six months, sixteen to eighteen hours ; one year, 
fourteen to fifteen hours. A child gets the best sleep 
in a darkened, well- ventilated, quiet room ; for during 
sleeping hours there is a subconscious activity, and if 
there is light and noise present the nervous, muscular, 
and tissue growth are hindered. Avoid the use of too 
much or too heavy clothing or covering, as either is a 
hindrance to the best growth and development. 

The average weight of a child at birth is seven and one- 
seventh pounds for a male, while a female weighs about 



INFANT FEEDING. 25 

seven pounds. Many children have greater weight at 
birth, while still others weigh less ; in either case the chil- 
dren are likely to be healthy. A child loses in weight for 
the first three or four days, but should regain its birth 
weight by the end of the second week ; then there should 
be a constant increase of body weight, which should be 
in proportion to the original weight. The weekly gain 
should be from five to eight ounces until the fifth month, 
and from that time until the twelfth month the weekly 
gain is not as great, — about three and one-half to seven 
ounces. The child's birth weight should be doubled at 
five months and trebled at fifteen months. From these 
figures it can be seen that the most rapid gain is during 
the first five months. Regular increase in weight is the 
best and safest guide known for determining the health 
conditions of the child. Children do not gain as rapidly 
during the summer months, this being especially true dur- 
ing the teething period. 

Nature has provided an animal food for the young of 
all mammalia, and mother's milk is the typical nourish- 
ment for her offspring in the early period of its existence. 
Statistics show that children among the slums of large 
cities will survive if fed from the breast, when if arti- 
ficially fed, death is almost sure to follow. 

The baby should be put to the breast six hours after 
birth; thus the secretion known as colostrum is injected, 
whose office is to cleanse the alimentary canal, thus pre- 
paring it for the milk secretion, which appears usually on 
the third day. After bathing and dressing, if the child lies 
quietly, it is left until the time of putting to the breast, 
but if it cries, one-half tablespoon of sterilized water is 
given at about 99° F., — the temperature of the child at 
birth. Children, like adults, need more water than is 
found in the food, and the baby should be given one-half 
tablespoon boiled water every four hours, after the second 
day, — the quantity being increased in proportion to the 
increase of the stomach capacity. It is best to have the 
baby drink it from a spoon, especially if it is to be fed 



26 



FOOD AND COOKERY. 



from the breast; it is, however, generally easier for the 
child to take it from a small bottle with nipple attached. 
If the bottle is used, it is sometimes difficult to get the 
child to take the breast. 

Regular feeding must be insisted upon as best for 
mother and child. It tends to keep the quality of the 
milk uniform, thus enabling the child to sleep better, not 
be overfed, and lessening the causes for indigestion. 
Too long intervals between the nursings produce a diluted 
product; while too short intervals, a condensed product. 
If regular feeding is observed the milk supply will agree 
with the capacity of the child's stomach. By more fre- 
quent nursing the milk glands are stimulated to secrete a 
larger quantity, and the little stomach capable of distension 
is overtaxed. Mothers should be made to realize that 
upon this care during a few months much of the later 
health and vigor of their offspring depend.

That the baby may not be overfed, it is necessary to 
emphasize the stomach capacity at different ages; thus the 
following table may be of value : —

- A mother's first thought should be for the welfare of 
her child, aud she should wisely regulate her exercise and 
sleep, making an effort to control emotions and avoid 
nervous disturbances, which so readily affect the composi- 
tion of the milk. A plain, wholesome diet, including meat, 
eggs, fish, cereals, fresh vegetables, and fruit, is recom- 
mended. Highly seasoned foods, pastry, and an excess 
of sweet foods should be avoided. Milk, or a beverage of 
which the principal constituent is milk, should be taken. 
While tea and coffee are not prohibited, cocoa is much 
more desirable. Oftentimes the three meals prove insuf- 
ficient, and a luncheon may be introduced in the forenoon, 
and milk or gruel before retiring. 

If the mother's milk proves inadequate to the child's 
needs, it often may be made suitable by change of diet 
and proper exercise. A child will lose on too rich a food 
as well as one lacking in nutritive value. The protein 
and fat in human milk are subject to variations, while the 
mineral matter and milk sugar are nearly constant. 

To increase the supply of milk, increase the liquid in 
the diet. To decrease the supply (which is seldom neces- 
sary), decrease the liquid. To increase the amount of 
protein, eat more meat and decrease the exercise; to de- 
crease the quantity, eat less meat, increase the quantity 
of liquid, and increase the exercise. To increase the fat, 
increase the meat, and also fats in a readily digested form, 



28 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

and walk two miles daily. To decrease the fat, eat cor- 
respondingly less meat and fat. 

Too much protein, which is the result of a large amount 
of meat, in the diet with little exercise, causes constipa- 
tion and colic. If the fat is increased with the protein, 
diarrhoea and vomiting follow.

Water 87.88%

Milk sugar 7.00%

Lactalbumin 1.00 % 

Note. — While human milk has a slightly alkaline reaction, it is also 
amphoteric. It will change red litmus paper blue ; blue litmus paper red. 



Cow's Milk. 

Average, good herd milk. 

Composition. Reaction slightly acid. 

Water 87.25% 

Fat 4.00% 

Milk sugar 4.75 % 

Mineral matter 0.75 %

Lactalbumin 0.60% 

By comparing the tables showing the composition of 
human and cow's milk, it will be seen tbat cow's milk 
contains more protein and mineral matter and less sugar 
of milk, the fat and water varying but little. The calf 
grows faster than the baby, therefore needs more building 



INFANT FEEDING. 29 

material. The baby, having a relatively larger surface 
exposed, loses more heat. 

The protein of milk is composed of lactalbumin and 
caseinogen. Lactalbumin is soluble in water, and as there 
is a larger percentage of this constituent in human than 
in cow's milk, the former during digestion forms into 
succulent curds ; while the latter, containing more case- 
inogen, forms into dense cheesy curds. 

Certified milk is the ideal artificial food for infant feed- 
ing, samples of which have been found to contain even 
less than 30,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter, while sale- 
able milk often contains as many as 500,000 bacteria per 
cubic centimeter. Milk of this standard can only be 
produced by taking the greatest pains and following the 
most strenuous precautions. The cows must be healthy 
and kept clean and properly fed, and they must be housed 
with due consideration in respect to fresh air, sunlight, 
and cleanliness. The milkers must keep themselves scru- 
pulously clean, and wear washable uniforms. Only by 
legislation can these standards be maintained. Milk which 
is sold as certified milk comes from farms which are in- 
spected at regular frequent intervals by medical boards, 
and the milk is tested in bactereological laboratories. 

It commands a high price on account of the cost of 
production, which prevents a more general distribution. 
It is necessary during the summer months to insure the 
health of infants, that they be fed on clean milk. In 
conjunction with artificial feeding it has been found that 
sick babies on the Boston Floating Hospital, by the addi- 
tion of one or two feedings of breast milk in the twenty- 
four hours, responded very quickly and were soon on the 
convalescent list. 

Milk directly from the cow is practically sterile, but is 
quickly contaminated. Milk being one of the best-known 
culture mediums, when once bacteria gain access they 
thrive and grow very rapidly. 

Cow's milk, to form a typical infant food, needs to be 
modified. In many large cities throughout the United 



30 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

States, laboratories, with accompanying farms in outlay- 
ing districts, have been established to furnish proper in- 
fants' food. While human milk is self-modifying, thus 
meeting the needs of the child in the different stages of 
its growth and development, its composition varies but 
little during the period of lactation. 

The modification of laboratory milk needs to be changed 
from time to time according to a physician's formula, lime- 
water being added to neutralize the acid present in cow's 
milk. Human milk is sterile, while cow's milk, in the 
hands of the consumer, contains many varieties of bac- 
teria; therefore it was formerly thought advisable to 
sterilize the modified product ; but sterilization has been 
largely superseded by pasteurization, and this is not deemed 
necessary or advisable, where fresh milk can be procured 
from a reliable source, except in cases of bowel trouble 
or in extremely hot weather. 

A child should not remain at the breast for more than 
fifteen or twenty minutes at each feeding. Never wake 
a healthy baby during the night for feeding. It is some- 
times necessary during the day, as a young child is quite 
liable to turn night into day ; but by persistent effort this 
may be overcome before it is an established habit. 

If for any reason the mother is unable to nurse her 
child, she must make a decision between a wet nurse and 
artificial feeding. Cow's milk is best adapted for artificial 
infant feeding, although in its composition it is not as 
nearly like human milk as the asses' or the mare's. Cows 
can be kept more easily under strict control than most 
animals, and when carefully stabled, fed, watered, and 
cleaned, produce a food which can be modified to meet the 
baby's needs. Durham, Devon, Ayrshire, and Holstein 
breeds are most satisfactory. Always procure milk from 
the herd rather than from a single animal. If the supply 
be obtained from a single cow, it is not uniformly as good 
quality, for an indisposition, fright, or worry of the animal 
affects the milk, and this in its turn reacts upon the 
child. 



INFANT FEEDING. 31 

Among intelligent and care-taking mothers, home modi- 
fication is being successfully employed, always under 
the direction of a physician. By this method a mixture 
can be easily prepared containing any percentage of fat, 
sugar, and protein suited to the needs of the individual 
baby from the most delicate weakling to the healthy infant. 
It has advantages over laboratory modification, namely : — 

1. Less handling. 

2. Shorter time from milking to consumer. 

3. Gravity cream digests more readily than centrifugal 

cream. 

4. Less handling renders pasteurization seldom nec- 

essary. 

Three methods are employed for separating the cream 
from the milk: 

1. Pouring. 

2. Chapin dipper. 

3. Siphoning. 

By the first and second methods mothers may be easily 
taught to do the work without much trouble, and while the 
result in percentage is not absolutely correct it is gener- 
ally quite satisfactory. By the third method (the one 
employed on the Boston Floating Hospital as well as in. 
nearly all institutions where special attention is given 
to the feeding of infants) the work is accurately done 
under perfect aseptic conditions. As it is much more 
complicated it requires the attention of thoughtful, intelli- 
gent persons, and mothers are only too glad to carry out 
the instructions of the physician or trained nurse for the 
welfare of their children. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to give formulas for 
home modifications, as it is plainly the work of the phy- 
sician. Simply for illustration a formula corresponding 
very nearly to human milk has been procured from one 



32 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

who is an authority on infant feeding by pouring off or 
removing with Chapin dipper the amount of the milk 
required. 

For Home Modification. 

Procure milk, delivered in quart glass jars, that has 
been reduced to a temperature of 45° F. as quickly as pos- 
sible after milking, and allowed to stand for cream to rise 
for six or eight hours. 

One [quart of whole milk of 4% fat will yield on an 
average after standing 8 hours — 

Upper l^j oz., well shaken will yield approximately 32% cream

" 6oz., " ." " " " 16% " 

" 8oz., " " " " " 12% " 

" 11 oz., " " " " " 10% " 

The lowest 8 oz. will yield practically fat-free milk. 
The middle milk is not used. 



Formula for Modified Cow's Milk, closely correspond- 
ing to Human Milk prepared by First or Second 
Method. 

Top milk (10% fat) 8 oz. 

Boiled water 11 oz. 

Lime-water 1 oz. 

Sugar of milk 2>* tablespoons. 

This amount is sufficient for ten feedings, allowing two 
ounces for a feeding. As soon as modified, it should be 
put in ten sterile nursing-bottles, each being plugged with 
absorbent cotton, and kept in a cold place until needed, 
then heated by plunging bottle in cold water and allowing 
the water to heat, gradually, until the milk is lukewarm, 
about 98° F., or by putting bottle in a pitcher of hot 
water.

milk (lactose) should be dissolved in boiling water before 
being added to the remaining ingredients.

16% cream 5 oz. 

Fat-free milk 4 oz.

Lime-water 1 oz. 

Sugar of milk 2% tablespoons. 

Bottles and nipples for infant feeding should be of the 
simplest construction, that, easily, they may be kept 
perfectly clean. As soon as baby has finished nursing, 
the nipple should be removed from bottle, and nipple 
and bottle thoroughly washed, then the bottle filled with 
water and the nipple immersed in water. Both should be 
made sterile each morning, when the number of feedings 
for twenty-four hours is prepared. The nipples should 
be allowed to remain in boiling water five minutes, and 
then immersed in cold water, to stand until needed. 

How to siphon Milk. 

1. Fill the siphon with cold water, place in saucepan 
containing cold water, bring to boiling point, and let boil 
three minutes, when it will be sterile. 

2. Place bottle of milk on a box, insert short end of 
siphon in bottle when water in tube will flow out and after 
that the milk, which may be drawn off into a bottle or 
graduate glass, the first 8 oz. drawn being fat-free milk. 

3. Draw off middle milk (which is not used) leaving 
in bottle the number of ounces of top milk to give the 
required percentage of cream. 

The siphon used in illustration was kindly loaned 
through the courtesy of the Boston Floating Hospital.

How to pasteurize Milk. 

Put milk in sterile, sinall-mouthed glass bottles, stop 
with cotton batting or absorbent cotton, place bottles 
in wire basket, immerse basket in kettle of cold water, 
and heat water gradually, to a temperature of from 
150° to 155°. Keep at same temperature thirty min- 
utes. Remove bottles, cool quickly, and put in a cold 
place. 

By this process almost all of the disease germs are 
killed ; also those germs which produce souring ; but the 
spores, which are not killed, will develop after a few 
days. If one is obliged to obtain milk from a doubtful 
source it may be necessary to resort to this method during 
the hot weather. The health of the child is the only guide 
to decide when its use may be discontinued. 



How to sterilize Milk. 

Proceed as in the pasteurization of milk, raising the 
temperature of the water to the boiling point (212° F.) 
and keeping at this temperature thirty minutes. Sterili- 
zation is an efficient method of destroying all germs, but 
alters the taste of milk, coagulates the albumen, destroys 
the fine emulsion of fat, and renders the casein less easy 
of digestion. 

Sterilizers are on the market which simplify the process 
of sterilization, and their use is recommended where 
expense need not be considered. 

Sterilized milk should not be fed to infants except 
under rare conditions and its use discontinued as soon as 
the case will permit. 

To determine the caloric value of milk modified for 
infant feeding, multiply the percentage of fat in formula 
by three, and the sugar plus the protein by one and three- 
tenths.

CHAPTER VI. 
CHILD FEEDING. 

A CHILD fed from the breast is weaned, usually, from 
the eighth to the twelfth month, the time depend- 
ing upon the health of both mother and child, as well as 
the season of the year. Unless compulsory, this change 
would better not take place during the summer months. 
Changes in diet should always be gradual ones, which is 
not the exception with the baby. Healthy children may 
be taught to drink from a cup or mug before taken from 
the breast, which will dispense with the use of the bottle. 
On the other hand, oftentimes ill or delicate children will 
not take sufficient nourishment in this way, and the bottle 
becomes a necessity for the welfare of the child. Baby 
not only eats better, but sleeps better, and keeps happier. 

Some children are allowed to use the bottle at nap and 
bed time until two years of age. While this seems to 
many an over-indulgence to the child, it is sometimes 
recommended by physicians as the best course to pursue. 

A healthy child of from eight to twelve months may be 
given a crust of stale bread, educators, rusks, Zwieback, 
and strained, well-cooked cereal diluted with milk. The 
necessity for an occasional drink of water, which was em- 
phasized in infant feeding, must not be overlooked in 
child feeding. 

From twelve to sixteen months a child requires four 
meals daily. 

Meals. Times for Serving. 

Breakfast 7.30 a. m. 

Lunch 11.30 a.m. 

Dinner' 2.30 p.m. 

Supper 5.30 p. m. 



CniLD FEEDING. 37 

If a child wakes very early, it may be given a crust of 
bread, a cracker, or a small quantity of milk, but not 
enough to take away the appetite for breakfast. 

For breakfast, serve a cereal sprinkled with sugar (spar- 
ingly) and top milk. Well-cooked, strained oatmeal, 
hominy, or any of the wheat preparations may be used, 
and it is desirable to offer variety. A glass of milk 
should accompany this meal. 

For luncheon, give strained cereal and milk, allowing 
three parts milk to one part cereal. In order that the 
child may have sufficient nourishment, pour off the upper 
half of quart jars of milk (top milk). In this way the 
neeessary fat is supplied. 

For dinner, serve a soft-cooked egg, or beef, chicken, 
or mutton broth thickened with strained rice or barley ; 
either with a piece of stale bread spread with butter, fol- 
lowed by steamed rice with cream and sugar, steamed or 
baked custard, junket custard, Irish moss blanc mange, 
strained stewed prunes, or juice of one-half orange. When 
eggs are introduced into the diet for the first few times, give 
but one-half egg. This quantity may be easily digested, 
while a whole egg might cause gastric disturbance. 

For supper, serve strained cereal and milk, same as for 
lunch. A child from sixteen to twenty-four months takes 
four meals, with the same hours for serving as the younger 
child, with some greater variety. 

For breakfast, in addition to cereal, give " soft-boiled," 
dropped, or coddled egg. Scrambled egg, if cooked with a 
small quantity of butter, may be occasionally served. It is 
well at this age to introduce one egg daily into the diet. 

For luncheon, give bread and butter, cracker, or cereal 
jelly with sugar and top milk in addition to the luncheon 
before served. 

For dinner, mashed baked potato, beef juice, boiled rice, 
or macaroni may be added. 

For supper, whole wheat or Graham bread spread with 
butter, stewed prunes, baked apple or apple-sauce, in 
addition to the supper before served. 



38 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Children over two years of age may begin to take fish, 
meat, vegetables, and fruits. White fish, broiled, steamed, 
or boiled, may be given in place of egg. Broiled lamb 
chops, broiled beefsteak, or rare roast beef, broiled or 
roasted chicken, or boiled fowl, are all suitable food, if 
introduced occasionally in small quantities. Spinach, 
asparagus tips, young tender string beans, and peas 
forced through a strainer, are all allowable. Fresh ripe 
strawberries, served with sugar, but not cream, may be 
eaten in the early part of the day, but should never be 
allowed after dinner. Blueberries and huckleberries had 
better not be introduced until after the fifth year, as they 
often act as irritants and give rise to summer complaints. 

Some children express a desire for bananas, which may 
be satisfied if the fruit is scraped to remove the astringent 
principle which lies close to the surface. Many physicians 
think they are more easily digested when baked. 

Cocoa, as well as milk, may be given as a beverage. 
The menu at this age is so varied, and the digestive 
powers of the child so increased, that strained cereals will 
no longer be necessary. Indian meal mush may now be 
taken, as well as the oat and wheat preparations ; also the 
cooked cereal products, put up ready for serving. 

Always avoid the use, in the dietary of a young child, 
of salted meats, pork, or veal, coarse vegetables (beets, 
carrots, turnips, etc.), cheese, fried foods, pastry, rich 
desserts, condiments, tea, coffee, beer, or any alcoholic 
stimulant, and iced water. 

The child's craving for sweets is a natural one and 
should be gratified. This is accomplished in part by 
sugar served with cereal and desserts. Vanilla chocolate 
is a most desirable food, as well as sweetmeat, and if 
eaten at the close of a meal is beneficial rather than 
harmful. Perhaps no food containing albumen, carbohy- 
drate, and fat is as well absorbed as chocolate. All the 
sugar is taken up, and there is a loss of only two per cent 
of the albumen, starch, and fat. 

The injurious effects of pure chocolate and candy are

due to their being eaten between meals or in excess, 
which destroys the appetite for plain, wholesome food. 

When the time arrives that the nap is no longer needed, 
which time varies with different children, three meals 
usually sulllce. The dietary may be gradually increased, 
until the child is able to partake of the family menu, 
avoiding, of course, a night dinner. The wise mother 
will encourage and continue a resting time until school 
hours interfere, even though not followed by sleep. 

The food of the child at school is of equal importance 
to the food of the infant. It must not be forgotten that 
digestive processes go on quickly, and activity is so great 
in childhood that an abundant supply of well-cooked, 
nourishing food is essential for both the development of 
body and mind. The irritability and weak nervous con- 
dition of school children, which is often attributed to 
over-study, is more often the result of excitement, want 
of sleep, and malnutrition. 

Never allow a child to go to school without a proper 
breakfast, of which a cereal served with sugar and rich 
milk or cream should form the principal dish. 

Many children enter kindergarten at the age of three 
and one-half or four years, most of whom carry a luncheon, 
a few minutes being set aside for the purpose of eating 
the same. This luncheon should be very simple, and 
limited in quantity, that the appetite may not be destroyed 
for the hearty dinner. In many cases where a child is 
fortified with a good breakfast, the luncheon would better 
be omitted, as the child has a better appetite and enjoy- 
ment of the midday meal. In kindergartens attended by 
the poor, a luncheon is an absolute necessity to the child's 
welfare, and fortunate is the community where an appro- 
priation is made for the supply of milk, with bread or 
crackers, or occasionally hot broth in the place of milk. 

If the older child attends a one-session school, the 
luncheon must not be overlooked. Whatever else goes 
into the luncheon basket, sandwiches must hold first 
place. If a variety is introduced ami pains are taken in 



40 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

their preparation, the little ones will look forward to 
them with as much interest as the sweets which follow. 
Doughnuts, rich cake, and pastry should be avoided, but 
simple crackers, cookies, and cakes may be used to 
advantage ; also fresh and dried fruits and nuts. Figs, 
dates, and nuts have a high food value, and if well masti- 
cated, an active child will digest them with comparative 
ease. 

In the high schools of many large towns and cities, 
lunch counters have been established for furnishing to the 
pupils well-cooked, nutritious food, at the least possible 
expense. Hot soups and cocoa may be found each day 
in addition to rolls, sandwiches, crackers, cookies, cake, 
fruit, and sometimes ice cream. 

A child, relatively to his weight, requires more food 
than a man or a woman. Three considerations explain 
this necessity : — 

1. The assimilative powers of a child are greater than those 
of an adult. 

2. A child has a larger surface in proportion to his weight ; 
which means a relatively larger heat loss. 

3. A child is growing, therefore requires a relatively larger 
supply of building material.

Children must have, for their best mental and physical 
development, a relatively larger proportion of proteid and 
fat in the dietary than their elders. The baby receives 
his proteid and fat from milk and cereals, but the older 
child needs, in addition to these, eggs, meat, and butter. 
Much of the pallor and stunted growth of some children is 
largely attributable to the lack of these very foods. 

As carbohydrates furnish the cheapest form of food, 
they are almost never found wanting, and oftentimes are 
used to excess. Carbohydrate in the form of sugar, if 
injudiciously given, may prove harmful, but if used wisely, 
when it does not interfere with digestive processes, is a 
most useful fuel food. 

The notion that sugar injures the teeth is largely a false 
one. If children are allowed to eat candy or cookies after 
the teeth have been brushed for the night, theu the sweets 
which collect between them cause decay. 

Milk, eggs, aud meat are sources for furnishing mineral 
matter, but the chief value of fruit and vegetables lies in 
this food constitutent, upon which tissue growth so much 
depends.

CHAPTER VII. 
FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

THE feeding of persons in health is of great impor- 
tance, but when one succumbs to disease, then 
feeding becomes a question of supreme moment. The 
appetite in health is usually a safe guide to follow, but is 
so perverted by disease conditions that it is unwise to 
consider its cravings. If these cravings are indulged, 
the food longed for is almost always a disappointment, 
as all things taste about the same, until the time of 
convalescence. 

Never consult a patient as to his menu, nor enter into a 
conversation relating to his diet, within his hearing. The 
physician in attendance studies the symptoms so closely 
that he is able to determine what is required to meet the 
needs of the case. He orders nourishment given regularly, 
usually in small quantities, at frequent intervals. Ap- 
preciating the value of sleep, he never allows his patient 
to be awakened for feeding, unless the exigencies of the 
case create this demand. 

In acute cases of disease, food plays a very important 
part towards recovery. The quantity and kind taken 
must vary greatly, according to the nature of the disease. 
Sometimes it proves expedient in cases of diarrhoea or 
dysentery to have the patient abstain for days from all 
food, except a very thin, starchy gruel, the object being 
to starve the germ which causes the disease ; then, again, 
a patient, after a surgical operation, where there is a 
great loss of blood, needs a large supply of food. 

Where the temperature is high, metabolism goes on so 
rapidly there is always a demand for a large quantity of

easily digested food, usually in a liquid form. Water 
is given freely, to assist in carrying off the waste 
products. 

In chronic cases, by a careful study of the food sup- 
ply, much can be clone to keep up the strength of the 
patient while endeavoring to overcome the disease. The 
greater the activity of the patient, the greater the need 
for food. 

Personal idiosyncrasies in disease, as well as in health, 
play a very important part. Avoid giving food that will 
overtax the digestion or disagree with any of the con- 
ditions of the patient. Food must be assimilated to 
be of value. The teeth, the mouth, the stomach, and 
the intestines all must be considered. Some food, if 
well masticated, might easily pass from the stomach 
into the intestines, while if not masticated, might prove 
a stomach irritant. Some food that would not prove 
irritating to the stomach would cause fermentation in the 
intestines. 

Many patients during the early stages of convalescence 
have an abnormally large appetite, which must be re- 
stricted, as over-feeding would prove dangerous; while 
with others the appetite needs to be stimulated. 

Important things to consider in feeding the sick : 

1. Appeal to the sense of sight. 

2. Appeal to the sense of taste. 

3. Consider temperature. 

4. Digestibility. 

5. Nutritive value. 

6. Economy. 

During the gradual return to a normal condition, 
through the long tedious hours of convalescence, the 
patient devotes much thought to when and what he shall 
be allowed to eat, and it is at this time that the taste is 
gratified as far as is advisable. 

The best means of stimulating the appetite is to have 
good food, well cooked, and attractively served. The

service should be the best at the command of the nurse, 
and too much attention cannot be given to every detail. 
The trays should be of correct size, so when laid not to 
have the appearance of being overcrowded ; on the other 
hand, if a small amount is to be served, have a small tray. 
The tray cloth should be spotless, and just fit over edge 
of tray. If the correct size is not at hand, one should be 
folded to fit tray, or a napkin may often be utilized for 
this purpose. Select the choicest china, silver, and glass- 
ware, making changes as often as possible. It often 
proves pleasing to carry out a color scheme. Nervous 
patients are apt to be depressed in the early morning, 
therefore for this reason make the breakfast tray as 
attractive as possible by using bright flowers. 

In setting a tray after laying the tray cloth, locate the 
plate. Place the knife at the right of plate, sharp edge 
toward plate. Place the spoon at the right of knife, bowl 
up. Place the fork at the left of plate, tines up. A 
bread and butter plate or individual butter is placed 
over fork a little to the left. The napkin is always 
placed at left of fork ; then cup and saucer at right of 
spoon, with cup so placed that it may be easily raised 
by handle. The water glass is placed over knife at little 
to right. Arrange the other dishes to suit the convenience 
of the patient. 

All eating is very much influenced by the taste. Some 
foods, easy of digestion, if repugnant to a patient, prove 
indigestible. 

The temperature of food has a marked influence upon 
digestion. As a rule, hot foods should be served hot, 
cold foods served cold; but this often must be varied 
according to the case. Under certain conditions very 
cold or very hot food might retard digestion, thus increas- 
ing the amount of energy necessary for absorption. 

Coarse foods, like Graham bread, some cereals, and 
vegetables containing much cellulose, pass through the 
alimentary canal so quickly that much of their nutritive 
value is lost, as so large a portion escapes absorption. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 45 

Sugar is completely absorbed by the system, while starch 
holds second place. The proteid of meat and eggs is well 
absorbed, only three per cent being lost ; in milk the loss 
is eight per cent. Fat, when taken in the form of butter, 
is almost completely absorbed, while in the absorption of 
fat in the form of milk, eggs, and cheese, there is a loss 
of six per cent ; in the fat of meat, a loss of seventeen 
per cent. Bacon furnishes an exception to this rule, as it 
ranks next to the fat of butter and cream. 

The nurse should be a student of the classification of 
foods, their fuel value and digestibility, thus being able 
to determine and regulate the needed rations for her 
patients. 

In feeding the sick, strict economy should be considered 
only when necessary. That which the patient really needs 
should be furnished always, if possible. Even in homes 
where the income is limited, there is a general self-denial 
for the one who is ill. It is a too-frequent error to over- 
indulge a patient, for it weakens rather than strengthens. 
From this fact, together with lack of knowledge and ap- 
pliance, those who are treated and cared for in a fine 
hospital are very apt to recover more quickly than those 
treated and cared for at home. 

In hospitals, where large numbers are to be fed, many 
of whom are not able to contribute towards the support 
of the institution and still others who cannot pay their 
proportionate part, strict economy in food supplies be- 
comes imperative. Many cheap foods are equally nutri- 
tious to the more expensive ones, and if well cooked and 
served are gratifying to all the senses to which one wishes 
to appeal. 

In hospitals the dietaries are classified by the doctors, 
to assist the nurses in caring for their patients, as house, 
soft solid, soft diet, and liquid. 

1. House, including : — soups, meat, fish, eggs, cereals, 

vegetables, fruit, desserts, etc. 

2. Soft solid, including : — creamed sweetbreads, eggs, 

creamed toast, asparagus, baked custards, etc.

3. Soft diet, including : — soft-cooked eggs, milk toast, 

junket, boiled custards, jellies, etc. 

4. Liquid, including : — broths, beef extract, beef tea, 

milk, gruels, egg-nogs, cream soups, cocoa, etc. 
A special diet is such as is ordered by a physician for 
an individual case. 



COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 47 



CHAPTER VIII. 
COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 

ROOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nourish- 
^ merit of the human body. Cookery is the effect 
produced on food by the application of heat, air, and 
moisture. 

" Uncivilized man takes his nourishment like animals, 
— as it is offered by nature ; civilized man prepares his 
food before eating, and in ways which are in general the 
more perfect the higher his culture. The art of cooking, 
when not allied with a degenerate taste or with gluttony, is 
one of the criteria of a people's civilization." There are 
comparatively few foods that are at their best when taken 
in the raw state ; they neither taste so good nor are they so 
easily digested as when subjected to some kind of cooking. 

Disease is oftentimes due to improper feeding. The food 
rations have not contained the correct proportions of the 
food principles, or the food stuffs have been improperly 
cooked. " Food well cooked is partially digested." 

Objects of cooking Pood. 

1. To make more palatable. 

2. To develop flavor. 

3. To render more digestible. 

4. To destroy bacteria and parasites. 

Methods employed for Cooking for the Sick.

48 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The subjects of food and feeding now stand on a 
scientific basis, and more attention is being paid each 
year to the subject of cookery. While the fact is to be 
recognized that there are some born cooks, the large 
majority need teaching and training. Cookery should 
form a part of every woman's education, and is especially 
important for those who have the feeding of the present 
generation, both in health and in disease. 

For the best results in cookery, good materials, ac- 
curate measurements, care in combining ingredients, and 
a knowledge of the object to be attained are essentials. 
In cooking, the effect of heat at different temperatures 
and the time of exposure of different foods to such tem- 
peratures must be thoroughly understood to reach the best 
nutritive and economic results. 

Measuring cups of glass, granite, or tin ware, divided 
into thirds or quarters, should be used. Tea and table 
spoons of regulation sizes, and also a case-knife, are 
indispensables. To insure uniformly good results, level 
measurements have been adopted by the leading teachers 
of cookery, which seem at the present time the best guide 
that can be given to the average cook. Perhaps the time 
may come when measurement by weight will be practical, 
and then accuracy will be assured beyond a doubt.

COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 49 

To measure butter, pack solidly into cup and level with 
case-knife. 

To measure a tea or table spoon of dry ingredients, dip 
spoon in same, fill, lift, and level with a case-knife, the 
sharp edge of knife being towards tip of spoon. Divide 
with knife lengthwise of spoon for half spoonful; divide 
halves crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for 
eighths. Less than an eighth of a teaspoou is considered 
a few grains. 

To measure tea or table spoons of liquid, dip spoon in 
liquid and take up all the spoon will hold. 

To measure tea or table spoons of butter, pack butter 
solidly into spoon and level with a knife. Divide same 
as for dry ingredients. 

Measure and have at hand all ingredients necessary 
for the preparation of a dish before attempting to com- 
bine. 

Ways of combining Ingredients. 

1. Stirring. 

Employed to mix ingredients. 

A circular motion, widening the circles until all is 
blended. 

2. Beating. 

Employed to enclose air. 

A turning of ingredient or ingredients over and over, 
continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used to be brought 
constantly in contact with the bottom of the dish 
and throughout the mixture. 

3. Cutting and Folding. 

Employed to so mix ingredients that air already 
introduced may not escape. 

A repeated vertical downward motion with a spoon 
and a turning over and over of mixture, allowing 
bowl of spoon each time to come in contact with 
bottom of dish. These motions are alternated 
until thorough blending is accomplished. 

The application of heat for boiling or steaming is not 
difficult to understand. Broiling and roasting need more

care, while baking requires good judgment, coupled with 
experience. In the many cook books, various oven tests 
are suggested, and oven thermometers have been placed 
upon the market, but all are of but little practical value, 
as one must gain this knowledge by her own experience. 

Vegetable foods abound in starch. Cold water sepa- 
rates starch grains ; boiling water causes them to swell 
and burst. 

Experiment 1. Mix two tablespoons flour with one- 
third cup cold water, and let stand five minutes. Flour 
settles to bottom of vessel. 

Experiment 2. Stir mixture and heat to boiling point. 
Starch grains swell and burst, making a paste. 

Dry heat, at a temperature of 320° F., changes starch to 
dextrine, which is soluble in cold water. Examples: 
Crust of bread and baked potato. 

In cooking vegetables the object is to soften cellulose 
as well as swell and burst starch grains, and this is best 
accomplished by keeping the water at the boiling point 
throughout the entire cooking. By the proper cooking of 
starchy foods their digestibility is greatly increased. 

Albumen is the principal constituent of white of egg. 
It is dissolved in cold water, and coagulated by heat at a 
temperature of 134° to 160° F. 

Experiment 1. Put white of egg in cold water, stir, 
and albumen is dissolved. 

Experiment 2. Put white of egg in cold water, heat 
gradually to boiling point, and albumen coagulates. 

One of the proteids of meat is albumen, some of which 
is soluble in cold water and coagulated by heat. 

Experiment 1. Cut beef in small pieces, put in cold 
water, and let stand twenty minutes. Water of a reddish 
color. 

Experiment 2. Heat to boiling point and dissolved 
albumen will be coagulated. 

Experiment 3. Cut beef in small pieces and plunge 
into boiling water. Albumen will be coagulated quickly, 
thus preventing its escape.

COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 51 

In using meats for soup-making, the object is to draw 
out as much of the goodness as possible. This is accom- 
plished by putting the meat on in cold water, and allow- 
ing the water to heat gradually to the boiling point, then 
simmering for several hours, after which time the meat is 
deprived of its extractives, some mineral water, and sol- 
uble albumen, though the greater part of its nutritive 
value is not extracted ; nevertheless, lacking flavor, it is 
hardly palatable for serving. In the making of stews, 
when meat and broth are both to be used, the meat should 
be put on in cold water, brought quickly to the boiling 
point, and then allowed to simmer until tender. 

Experiments have shown that where the water is allowed 
to boil vigorously during the entire cooking, the connective 
tissue has been gelatinized, while the fibres are hard and 
indigestible ; quite the reverse is true of the fibres where 
the meat is cooked for a longer time at a lower temper- 
ature, and the connective tissues are partially dissolved. 
In the latter case the economy of fuel is worthy of con- 
sideration. 

Cold water dissolves albumen, hot water coagulates it, 
as does intense heat. Meats, when broiled or roasted, are 
brought in direct contact with intense heat (coal, gas, 
or electricity furnishing the fuel), and turned frequently, 
thus searing the entire surface as quickly as possible. 
This method is applied to the more expensive cuts of 
meat. Meat, when baked iu a hot oven, is commonly 
called roasted, as the old method of roasting before live 
coals has almost passed out of use. 

In cooking meats, when the object is to retain as much 
nutriment as possible, the surface should be subjected to 
a high temperature to quickly coagulate albuminous 
juices. When cooked in water, the water must be at the 
boiling point to accomplish this, allowed to boil vigor- 
ously for five minutes, and then allowed to simmer for 
several hours. This method is applied to the cheaper 
cuts of meat. 



52 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



CHAPTER IX. 
WATER. 

MORE than two-thirds of the weight of the body 
consists of water. An adult requires five pints 
daily, and is furnished with this supply from the food he 
eats and the beverages he drinks. The outgo is even 
greater than the income, owing to the chemical changes 
which are constantly taking place in the body. 

Pure water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, there 
being two parts of hydrogen to one part of oxygen. The 
symbol of water is H 2 0. 

Water as found in nature is never chemically pure. It 
not only contains many mineral substances, but decaying 
animal and vegetable matter, and often pathogenic germs. 
From this statement it may be seen that a water supply 
cannot be too carefully guarded. 

The clear, colorless, tasteless fluid furnishes the average 
person with sufficient evidence of its purity ; while if lacking 
in any of these qualities he seems to be equally assured 
of its unfitness for consumption. These tests are entirely 
useless, and scientific investigations are the only safeguards 
to a proper water supply. 

Filters, as used to render drinking water pure, are 
a delusion and a snare. The bed of a filter furnishes a 
desirable soil for the growth of bacteria, and while some 
of the larger organic particles are removed by filtration, 
the rapidity with which the micro-organisms increase 
render it less fit for use. 

Distilled water, prepared for medicinal purposes, ia 
chemically pure. It is flat and insipid to the taste, having 
been deprived of its atmospheric gases. When used as a 



WATER. 53 

beverage it should be aerated. Boiled water is freed from 
all organic impurities and salts of lime are precipitated. 

Water for household consumption is derived from five 
sources : — 

1. Rains. 

2. Rivers. 

3. Surface water and shallow wells. 

4. Deep Artesian wells. 

5. Springs. 

In many large towns and cities a system of reservoirs 
has been built, fed by springs and streams which have 
greatly improved water supplies. 

Where well water is used, especial attention should be 
given to the location of the well. It must be of sufficient 
distance from drains, cesspools, and barnyards to prevent 
contamination. 

Water drawn from large ponds, lakes, or rivers having 
a bottom of rock, clay, or gravel, usually furnishes a safe 
supply. The law, nevertheless, requires frequent analyses 
— thus helping, as far as possible, to make healthful 
conditions prevail. 

Water is frequently spoken of as hard or soft. Hard 
water contains mineral matter to a greater extent than 
soft water, the amount varying from eight to seventy 
grains to the gallon. 

The hardness is due principally to salts of lime and 
magnesia. Soft water is free from an excess of these 
salts, containing but three to four grains to the gallon. 
Water is the greatest known solvent, and the softer the 
water the greater its solvent power. 

Water Temperatures. 

32° F Freezing point. 

32 to 65° F Cold. 

65 to 92° F Tepid. 

92 to 100° F Warm. 

100° F. and over Hot. 

185° F Simmering point. 

212° F Boiling point (sea level). 



54 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Many people are accustomed to boil water for drinking 
purposes. Hard water, due to the presence of carbonates 
of lime, is rendered soft by boiling with a small quantity 
of bicarbonate of soda (NaHC0 3 ). 

Uses in the Body. 

1. To quench thirst. 

2. To nourish. 

3. To regulate body temperature. 

4. To assist in carrying off waste products. 

5. To maintain the proper degree of dilution for all the 

fluids of the body. 

6. To stimulate the nervous system and various organs. 

7. To form a part of all cell life, as metabolism cannot 

go on without it. 

Water taken in moderation with meals if not over 
chilled dilutes the food so it is more easily absorbed. 

Cold water to a small extent retards gastric digestion, 
but increases peristalsis. If a glassful is taken before 
breakfast and upon retiring, it often cures constipation. 

Tepid water is successfully used as an emetic, 90° F. 
being the temperature at which it is administered. 

Hot water acts as a stimulant to gastric digestion. It 
leaves the stomach more quickly and is more quickly 
absorbed than cold water. Hot water relieves thirst better 
than cold water. It will also relieve nausea, — a small 
quantity of crushed ice having the same effect. 

Water has many uses of valuable importance to man 
which ought to be mentioned; namely, for transpor- 
tation, manufacturing purposes, and the generation of 
electrical power; but the purpose of this work is to 
consider it as a cleanser, an antiseptic, and a source of 
infection. The relation which bathing bears to health 
need hardly be emphasized, as it has for so long a time been 
duly recognized. Frequent bathing keeps the pores of the 
skin open, thus enabling much waste matter to be elim- 
inated. Water is a carrier of disease germs, and too 
frequent are the cases of typhoid fever caused by drinking

water. The only sure way of destroying pathogenic germs 
in water is by boiling the same. Boiled water is a valuable 
antiseptic, and will not ferment. 

There are many charged, carbonated, and mineral spring 
waters bottled and put upon the market. Some are used 
as table beverages, others for medicinal purposes. They 
stimulate the flow of gastric juice. 

Ordinary water, artificially charged with carbon di- 
oxid (C0 2 ), is called soda water, and may be purchased by 
the glass, usually in combination with fruit syrups or in 
syphons. Such water, when sold at the druggist's, contains 
a larger per cent of C0 2 than carbonated (naturally charged) 
waters, which renders it cooler to the taste, as the gas in 
passing off withdraws heat. 

Plain soda water, taken in moderation, assists gastric 
digestion. It is a bad practice to indulge too freely in 
soda water with fruit syrups, as it causes a tendency to 
flatulency and indigestion. Almost all so-called fruit 
syrups are chemically prepared in the laboratory. 

Among the most common carbonated table waters may 
be mentioned, Poland (uneffervescing), and Vichy, Johan- 
nis, Apollinaris, and Seltzer (effervescing). These often 
tempt people to drink who would otherwise neglect to do 
so, and in cases of fever they may be freely given. They 
are useful to dilute alcoholic liquors, and they are quite 
apt to relieve nausea and vomiting. 

The alkaline mineral waters are all carbonated. Their 
most important ingredient is alkaline carbonates, and so- 
dium chloride, sometimes sodium sulphates being present. 
Examples: Saratoga, Vichy, White Sulphur Spring, 
Hot Sulphur Spring, Hunyadi, and Londonderry Lithia 
Waters. Lithia water is often recommended in cases of 
rheumatism or gout; Hunyadi for liver troubles and in- 
discretions in diet. 

Where patients are advised by physicians to visit water 
cures the good results obtained are due as much to change, 
rest, treatment, and quantity of water ingested, as to any 
especial value that the water itself contains. 



56 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



CHAPTER X. 

MILK. 

AT ILK is an ideal food. This statement is plainly 
*■'■* demonstrated by the fact that it furnishes the 
nourishment for the young of all mammalia during the 
period of their most rapid growth. While its value must 
not be overestimated in the dietary of the healthy adult, 
it is a matter of fact that in many countries the inhabit- 
ants live for the most part on it. This is true of the 
peasants of Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, the Bed- 
ouins of Arabia, and the peoples dwelling in the moun- 
tain regions of Asia and on the pasture lands of the 
Sahara. It would be necessary for the man at work in 
the United States to consume four quarts daily in order 
to get the necessary quantity of protein, and by so doing 
he would be furnished with an excess of fat and a limited 
supply of carbohydrates. No one food can meet all the 
requirements of the body except during infancy. 

Milk should be regarded as a food rather than as a bev- 
erage. While it is a liquid outside the body, as soon as it 
enters the stomach it is made solid by the action of rennin, 
which causes it to become clotted. Milk is of most value 
in a mixed dietary, when taken between meals with a 
cracker or piece of bread, and it should be sipped rather 
than drunk. If taken quickly in large quantities, so dense 
a curd is formed in the stomach that it is with difficulty 
that the gastric juice acts upon it. As has been stated, 
each food calls forth a special kind of gastric juice, and in 
the case of milk it is in moderate supply and of moderate 
strength. Children absorb ninety-six per cent of the total 
solids of milk, while adults absorb eighty-nine per cent. 
With the aged, as digestion becomes impaired, milk should 
hold a prominent place in the daily dietary. 



MILK. 57 

Composition of Cow's Milk.

Many milk analyses have shown that the nutritive con- 
stituents of milk vary to a considerable degree, this even 
holding true of the milk from a single cow at different 
milkings, the greatest difference being in the quantity 
of fat. Jersey and Guernsey breeds yield the largest quan- 
tity of fat, but a smaller supply of milk. The largest 
amount of fat is obtained in the morning's milking. 

The quality and quantity of milk is not only determined 
by the breed, but by the age, health, housing, feeding, 
care, and time of lactation of the animal from which it 
comes. It is an absolute necessity that the milk supply 
be carefully inspected, and in all large cities chemists are 
employed for this purpose, whose work has been of the 
greatest value. 

Milk is more quickly contaminated than any other food 
product. 

How contaminated. 

1. By improper feeding of animal. 

2. " poor conditions due to nursing, worrying, etc. 

3. " disease germs from the cow. 

4. " extraneous disease germs. 

5. " souring and decomposition. 

6. " absorption of bad odors. 

Milk, as soon as it comes from the animal, should be 
put in sterile vessels, cooled as quickly as possible, 
covered, and kept at a low temperature. 

In the hands of the consumer it always contains a large 
number of micro-organisms, the greater number of which 
tend to increase lactic fermentation, which causes souring. 
If milk is kept under favorable conditions and for not too 
long a time, these do not sufficiently multiply to cause 
anxiety. 



58 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The pathogenic germs in milk are often causes of 
typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and 
cholera. They are killed at 167° F., a much lower tem- 
perature thau the micro-organisms which produce souring, 
and they also occur in smaller numbers. 

When in doubt of the milk supply, it is always best to 
scald it. 

If milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the fat rises 
to the surface in the form of cream ; this is due to its 
lower specific gravity. Such cream is called gravity 
cream. "When a separator is used for removing cream, 
the cream thus obtained is called centrifugal cream. It 
must not be inferred from this that cream contains 
nothing but fat, for it holds relatively as large a propor- 
tion of sugar and proteid as milk itself, the deficiency 
being in the proportion of water. Cream is an expensive 
form of fat, and must be regarded as a luxury. 

Lactose (sugar of milk) is equal in nutritive value to 
cane sugar. It has some advantages over cane sugar, for 
under ordinary conditions it does not ferment, it is not so 
quickly absorbed, and it is a diuretic. Lactose is not so 
sweet to the taste as cane sugar, which renders it of value 
in the sick-room ; it is, however, an expensive fuel food. 

The protein of milk is the cheapest form in which 
animal proteid may be obtained. It consists principally 
of casein, albumen to a smaller extent, some globulin, and 
traces of peptone. 

Potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulphur, 
phosphorus, and chlorine are all found in the ash of 
milk in the form of oxides, chlorides, or acids. 

Skim Milk. 

Milk from which most of the fat has been removed is 
known as skim milk. The quantity of fat removed de- 
pends on the manner in which the work is accomplished. 
Separator skimmed milk has less fat than that from deep 
cold setting. Skim milk has more protein than whole 
milk, and a slightly larger proportion of milk sugar. 



MILK. 59 

Skim milk may be advantageously used by the poorer 
classes. Its deficiency in fat may be made up, easily, by 
obtaining it from cheaper sources than whole milk. 

Buttermilk. 

Buttermilk is obtained from cream during its manu- 
facture into butter. Its composition differs but little 
from that of skim milk. It contains less proteid and 
sugar and more fat. 

It has a slightly acid taste, which makes it an agree- 
able beverage, and it is well borne by people of weak 
digestion. 

It acts as a laxative. 

"Whey. 

When milk is clotted by the action of rennet, wine, or 
an acid, and after standing a few minutes is strained 
through a double thickness of cheese cloth, the liquid 
obtained is known as whey. It is a slightly laxative 
fluid of small nutritive value. 

Koumiss, Kefir, and Matzoon. 

Koumiss, originally fermented mare's milk, was first 
made, hundreds of years ago, in the steppes of Russia 
and Southwestern Asia. A double fermentation takes 
place in its manufacture, — lactic and alcoholic. Lactic 
fermentation begins first, while alcoholic lasts longer. It 
is the purpose of the Koumiss maker to hinder lactic 
fermentation as far as possible. Koumiss is made in the 
United States from cow's milk, yeast being the ferment 
used. 

The alcohol (C 2 H 5 OH) and carbon dioxid (C0 2 ) formed 
during fermentation render the milk more easily digested 
and absorbed than in its natural state. It is consequently 
of great value in the sick-room, and is the one form in 
which milk seldom fails to be retained by the patient. 

Kefir and Matzoon are fermented cow's milk, varying 
but little in composition from Koumiss. Koumiss and

Matzoon may be purchased in all cities and large towns

Ways of preserving Milk. 


1. 

2. 
3. 


By scalding. 

By pasteurization. 

By sterilization. 


4. 


By condensation. 


5. 


By evaporation. 




Adulteration. 



The adulteration of milk is far less frequent than for- 
merly, as inspection, under law, is liable to take place at 
any time. 

Where adulteration takes place it is accomplished, most 
commonly, by the removal of some of the cream or the 
addition of water. Salt, sugar, chalk, and starch are less 
often employed as adulterants. Annatto, caramel, or ani- 
line dyes are used for coloring, that the product may look 
as though it were of the best quality. 

Milk sours so quickly during warm weather that preser- 
vatives have often been resorted to to overcome this 
bacterial action. Among these have been found borax, 
boracic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, potassium chro- 
mate, and carbonate of soda. 

While these adulterants and preservatives are not 
poisonous when taken in the milk for an indefinite period, 
they are deleterious to health. 

Massachusetts authorities prohibit the sale of "not of 
standard quality" milk as well as of adulterated milk; 
while other states have equally stringent laws. The fol- 
lowing statute defines standard milk : — 

"If the milk is shown upon analysis to contain less 
than thirteen per cent of milk solids, or to contain less 
than nine and three-tenths per cent of milk solids exclu- 
sive of fat, it shall be deemed for the purposes of this act 



MILK. 61 

to be not of good standard quality except during the 
months of April, May, June, July, and August, when milk 
containing less than twelve per cent of milk solids, or 
less than nine per cent of milk solids exclusive of fat, or 
less than three per cent of fat, shall be deemed to be not 
of good standard quality." 

Effects of Cooking. 

When milk is heated a scum rises to the top, which con- 
sists of coagulated albumen, a small quantity of coagulated 
casein, and some fat. If the scum is removed some of 
the nutritive value of the milk is lost. If scalded milk 
is beaten with an egg-beater the scum, which is so un- 
sightly, is well intermingled with the mass. 

Milk should always be heated in a double boiler, where 
it never reaches a higher temperature than 196° F. If 
heated in a single utensil, it may reach the boiling point 
(214° F.), when it is liable to boil over or to burn, and it 
always takes an unnecessarily long time to wash and 
scour the dish. 

The taste of milk is altered by the application of heat. 
The flavor of cooked milk is not so agreeable to the taste 
as uncooked milk. For this reason, if cooked milk is to 
be taken alone, it should be chilled as quickly as possible, 
which somewhat overcomes the change of taste. 

Digestibility. 
Milk is easy of digestion and absorption. When com- 
paring the digestibility of raw with cooked milk experi- 
ments have shown such different results that one cares to 
be guarded in making statements. The clots formed by 
cooked milk are smaller and less dense than those formed 
by raw milk ; notwithstanding this fact, it is a prevalent 
belief that the casein is not so readily absorbed nor the 
fat so completely assimilated. 

Milk in the Sick-Room. 

The value of milk as a food in cases of disease cannot 
be overestimated. 



62 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Advantages. 

1. It contains the five food principles. 

2. It is inexpensive. 

3. It is easily procured, measured, and taken. 

4. It agrees with most people. 

5. It does not overtax the digestive system. 

6. It is a non-irritant. 

7. It may be modified. 

8. It may be combined with other foods. 

9. It is deficient in uric acid derivatives. 

Objections to a strictly Milk Diet. 

1. Its bulk. 

2. Danger of insufficient nourishment. 

3. Taste disliked. 

4. It causes nausea (probably due to fat). 

5. Forms dense clots. 

6. Causes constipation (overcome by magnesia). 

7. Increases acidity of urine. 

8. Introduces micro-organisms. 

9. Causes fur-coated tongue. 

To the casual observer the disadvantages might seem 
to more than counterbalance the advantages. This is not 
the case, however, as the disadvantages in most cases may 
be easily overcome. 

When whole milk does not agree with a patient, skim 
milk, or cream diluted with water, may often be employed 
successfully. 

Adapting for the Sick. 
1. Altering taste. 

By heating, adding salt, pepper, ginger, cinnamon, 
nutmeg, tea, coffee, chocolate, lime-water, seltzer 
water, Apollinaris, beef extract, brandy, whiskey, 
rum, or sherry. 



MILK. 63 

Improving digestibility. 

By skimming, scalding, diluting with charged waters 
or farinaceous gruels, or by adding alkalines or 
acids. Addition of salt prevents biliousness. 

Bicarbonate of soda prevents mal-fermentation. By 
the addition of farinaceous gruels milk forms in 
less dense clots. 

By scalding, lactic acid fermentation is restricted. 
Hot milk soothes mucous membrane, allays a 
slight throat irritation, increases peristalsis, and 
tends to produce sleep. 
Predigesting. 

By adding Fairchild's Pancreatin or Pepsin powder, 
which changes the proteids to albumoses, and if the 
process is continued long enough, to peptones. If 
converted to peptones there will be a bitter taste. 

Predigested milk is used in extreme cases to bridge 
the patient over a critical period, and for forced 
feeding in many hospitals and by many physicians. 

According to the best authorities, however, predi- 
gested milk has no advantage over ordinary milk. 
From the fact that the proteins are partially 
digested, it would seem that a large amount of 
nutriment could be given in predigested milk ; if, 
however, it is administered in sufficient quantities 
to supply a large amount of nutriment, one of two 
symptoms usually appear, — diarrhoea or nausea.

CHAPTER XI. 

ALCOHOL. 

A LCOHOL, C 2 H 5 OH (ethyl alcohol), is obtained by the 
**■ fermentation of sugar. It must be considered as a 
food, as it is so completely oxidized in the body, only ten 
per cent passing out of the system. The question of its 
use is a moral one, and in health it is entirely unneces- 
sary. It does not enable a man to do more mental or 
physical work, and the higher sensibilities are not assisted. 
Armies and athletes always avoid its consumption. 

High proof alcohol, as sold, contains ninety-five per cent 
of alcohol; while absolute alcohol contains ninety-nine 
per cent. 

Alcoholic beverages are divided into

Alcohol. 



When an extra quantity of alcohol is added, liquors are 
said to be fortified. 

Distilled liquors are responsible for nine-tenths of the 
evil results of intemperance. The new and raw ones are 



ALCOHOL. 65 

the most harmful, for they contain a considerable quantity 
of fusel-oil, — a poisonous natural product difficult to 
eliminate. This diminishes with age, when they mellow 
and improve in flavor. 

Alcohol is used in the sick-room for bathing purposes, 
and is usually diluted with water. Its local effect is that 
of an irritant. 

Alcoholic beverages produce : — 

1. Cheer and good fellowship. 

2. Excitement and buoyancy. 

3. Loss of self-control and judgment. 

4. Loss of control of muscular movements. 

5. Stupor. 

6. Depression. 

The physiological effects of alcohol are as yet incom- 
pletely understood. Its effect on the respiratory system 
is very slight, and on the circulatory system very doubtful ; 
but it is given for the purpose of stimulating heart action. 
If given in small quantities it assists gastric digestion ; in 
moderate quantities, it retards the flow of gastric juice ; 
and in large quantities albumen is precipitated. Its effect 
on metabolism is that of partially paralyzing the cells, 
thus causing them to lose some of their power to break 
down proteids, carbohydrates, and fats. 

Effects produced by the habitual use of alcoholic 
beverages : — 

1. Throat becomes husky. 

1. Chronic gastric catarrh. 

3. Inability to resist disease. 

4. Fatty degeneration of the liver and hardening of 

its cell walls. 

5. Thickening of the walls of the arteries, especially 

the artery that supplies the heart. The heart, 
being improperly nourished, gives out, and heart 
failure is the result. 

6. Apoplexy. 



66 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

It should be left to the physician to dictate the kind, 
quantity, and frequency of administering alcoholic bever- 
ages. One kind is often given to advantage, while several 
might disturb digestion. They are preferably given 
before or at the time of meals. When taken between 
meals they should be accompanied by a biscuit or 
cracker. 

Conditions which justify their Use. 

1. When the pulse is persistently weak. 

2. When there is persistent high temperature. 

3. When there is nervous exhaustion. 

4. When there is tremor or low delirium. 

5. When the digestive system fails to do its work. 

6. When the aged are feeble or exhausted. 

7. Cases of shock or accident. 

The use of alcoholic beverages in some diseases seems 
almost imperative. Lives, without doubt, have been saved 
by the use of champagne. In fevers it is often given to 
produce depression, which results in sleep. In this way 
much strength is saved for the critical crisis. Brandy 
and red wines are given in cases of diarrhoea on account 
of the tannic acid they contain, which acts as an astringent. 
Erysipelas seems to be one of the diseases which calls for 
large quantities of alcohol. From eighteen to twenty 
ounces of brandy or whiskey may be administered daily 
without producing any intoxicating effects. Diabetes also 
demands the use of alcoholic stimulants. Brandy is the 
liquor generally preferred, as it assists in the digestion of 
fats. Pneumonia in feeble or elderly subjects calls for 
alcoholic stimulants ; while in cases of diphtheria patients 
are often saved by their early and energetic use. 

Many malt extracts and malted foods have been placed 
upon the market, some of which contain a minimum 
quantity of alcohol ; but they are principally valuable for 
the diastase they contain, which aids in the digestion of 
carbohydrates. 



ALCOHOL. 67 

The value of the patent spring medicines usually lies 
in the alcohol which they contain. Their stimulating 
effects lead many to believe that they are receiving 
permanent help rather than a temporary support. By 
analysis many have been found to contain as much alcohol 
as is present in sherry wine ; while in others the per cent 
is greatly in advance. Would it not be wise to consult 
a physician rather than experiment along lines where 
danger is so imminent?

CHAPTER XH. 

BEVERAGES. 

A BEVERAGE is any drink. Water, the chief one of 
■*"*■ them all, is Nature's beverage. Almost all of the 
beverages have but little nutritive value (exception must 
be made, however, to egg-nogs, cocoa, chocolate, etc.) ; 
nevertheless their use in health as well as in disease 
should be carefully considered. When abstinence from 
solid or semi-solid food is necessary for a short time, a 
liquid diet must furnish the nourishment. 

Starchy beverages include toast, rice, and barley water. 
Rice and barley water are given to reduce a laxative con- 
dition of the bowels, and are often used alternately. Rice 
water is soothing to the whole alimentary canal. Toast 
water is given in extreme cases of nausea. 

Fruit beverages are cooling, refreshing, slightly stimu- 
lating, and are valuable for the salts, acids, and sugar 
they contain. They are frequently employed when high 
temperature is present. Lemons and oranges are most 
used in the making of fruit beverages on account of their 
cheapness and popularity. Raspberries, strawberries, 
pineapples, currants, grapes, and tamarinds are used less 
frequently. As all fruits contain one or more acids, a 
physician should be consulted as to the kind to be given 
in individual cases. Pineapple contains a ferment which 
digests proteids. 

Wine whey is slightly stimulating, and is often retained 
in severe gastric troubles. For a limited period it may 
be used successfully for debilitated infants with weak 
digestion. It stimulates the digestive ferments to such 
an extent that there may be a gradual return to a regular 



BEVERAGES. 69 

diet. Clam water and oyster liquor sometimes stimulate 
the appetite. Clam water, administered in small quanti- 
ties, is especially valuable in relieving extreme cases of 
nausea ; in larger quantities it acts as a laxative. 

Egg-nogs, and other beverages in which eggs are used, 
play a most important part in the dietary of the sick, for 
by their use nutriment in a concentrated form is easily 
administered. 

Tea. 

The leaves of the evergreen shrub, Thea, furnish the 
tea of commerce, both black and green. 

The best brands of black tea are imported from India 
and Ceylon; the best green tea comes from Japan, and a 
small quantity from China. Tea leaves before curing 
have neither odor nor flavor. 

There are four gatherings annually. The first picking 
comes in April, and is considered the best. 

Climate, elevation, soil, cultivation, selection of the 
leaves, and the care in the picking and curing of them, 
all go to make up the difference in quality. First qual- 
ity tea is made from the young, tender, whole leaves. In 
black tea the leaves are allowed to ferment, while in 
green tea the leaves are unfermented. 

Tea is a stimulant rather than a nutrient. Its stimu- 
lating effect is due to the alkaloid thein and a volatile oil. 
Its astringency is due to tannin. Black tea contains less 
tannin than green tea, while the thein and oil vary but 
little. 

Tea should always be made as an infusion, by the use 
of freshly boiled water, with but one infusion to each 
measure of tea. The practice of allowing tea to boil, or 
allowing leaves to be used and reused with a small 
additional supply, cannot be too strongly condemned. 
The thein is so soluble that it is almost immediately dis- 
solved out of the leaf. Tannic acid is developed as 
soon as tea is placed in boiling water, but in a small 
quantity. Experiments have shown that more tannic 
acid is developed in a five-minute than in a three-minute 



70 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

infusion, and the longer it stands, the more tannic acid is 
drawn out. 

Tea drinkers require less food than those not addicted 
to its use, as it has been proved that there is less wear 
to the tissues when it is frequently indulged in. This 
accounts for the large quantity drunk by the poor. It 
would appear from its immediate stimulating and satisfy- 
ing effects that it had a food value ; but when it is con- 
stantly used to take the place of food, sooner or later 
evil effects are apparent, and the victim, if attacked by 
disease, finds that the system offers little resistance. 
The harmful effects are due, principally, to the tannic 
acid and oil, as thein stimulates rather than retards gas- 
tric digestion. 

Tea is stimulating, refreshing, and often relieves bodily 
fatigue and headache. It has a slight influence in regu- 
lating circulation and temperature. It is one of the 
most cooling drinks in summer and warming drinks in 
winter. On an empty stomach it acts as a diuretic. 
Excessive tea drinkers are apt to become nervous, to 
suffer from insomnia and mental depression. The habit 
must be closely guarded, for the habitual, excessive tea 
drinker often becomes a nervous wreck. 

To the aged it is " The cup that cheers." It certainly 
proves a useful stimulant as the functional activities of 
the stomach become weakened. It never should be given 
to children, and would better be avoided by the young. 

Coffee. 

Coffee is the seed of the berry of the evergreen tree 
Caffcea Arabica, which yields, annually, three harvests. 
Each berry contains two seeds enclosed in a husk. Ex- 
ception must be made to the male berry, which contains 
but one seed. 

Coffee was formerly cured by being dried in the sun, 
but owing to the warm climate and frequent rainfalls in 
the countries in which it is grown, slow artificial heat is 
preferable, and is imported to be cleaned, sized, roasted,

and ground. The coffee berry in its raw state has no 
odor or flavor, both being developed by roasting. 

For its cultivation it requires a warm climate, rich soil, 
and protection from wind and storms. 

Java coffee is the finest coffee grown, but much sold 
under that name does not come, necessarily, from the 
island of Java. Any coffee having the distinctive flavor 
of Java coffee, no matter where grown, bears the name. 
Maleberry Java commands a higher price than any other 
coffee on the market. Brazil, Central America, Mexico, 
and Arabia are all coffee countries. 

Coffee, like tea, is usually blended, the most popular 
mixture being three or four parts Java to one part Mocha. 
The Mocha gives a certain sparkle and aciditv which the 
general public demands. 

Coffee, like tea, is a stimulant. Its stimulating effect is 
due to caffein and a volatile oil. The effect of caffein is 
nearly identical with that of thein. Coffee also contains 
tannin. As taken for a beverage it is more stimulating 
than tea, from the fact that so much more is used. Its 
food value lies in the sugar and cream served with it. 

Coffee should be bought in small quantities and kept 
tightly covered in a glass jar or tin canister. It should 
not be ground until purchased, and when convenient, it is 
best ground at home. On account of the large quantity 
of volatile oil it contains, it quickly depreciates in value. 

Coffee may be prepared as a decoction (boiled coffee), 
filtration, or infusion. Coffee for filtering should be finely 
ground. 

Coffee strengthens heart action, increases respiration, 
and excites mucous membrane. It is a nerve stimulant 
and a diuretic. It removes the sensation of fatigue, for 
which reason it is used by many nurses when on night 
duty. It is often valuable to relieve nausea after an 
anaesthetic, and often proves useful in cases of opium and 
alcoholic poisoning. 

A cup of black coffee assists digestion, while a cup of 
breakfast coffee, as ordinarily served, retards digestion, 



72 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

but not to as great an extent as tea. When there is * 
flatulent state of the stomach, tea increases the amount of 
gas, in which case coffee is to be preferred. When taken 
in excess coffee produces biliousness, languor, restless- 
ness, heartburn, palpitation of the heart, tremor, dyspep- 
sia, and insomnia. 

Many preparations have been put upon the market as 
coffee substitutes, but to the coffee drinker there is no 
substitute. They, however, make a pleasing hot bever- 
age, and when properly made and served with sugar and 
cream, they have a food value. To the adult a single cup 
of coffee at breakfast and a single cup of tea at luncheon 
seldom prove harmful, and are acceptable to the average 
person. 

Cocoa and Chocolate. 

Cocoa and chocolate are manufactured from the cacao 
bean of commerce. This bean, a native of Mexico, is the 
seed of a fruit from six to ten inches in length, containing 
from twenty to thirty seeds. The area of the cocoa belt 
for remunerative crops is limited, being chiefly confined to 
Mexico, South America, and the West Indies. The fruit 
matures throughout the year, taking four months for 
ripening; but the principal harvest is in the spring. 

The fruit is gathered and allowed to remain in a heap 
on the ground for twenty-four hours, the pods are then 
cut open and the seeds removed, drained, and put in a 
sweating-box for two days to undergo the process of 
fermentation. The flavor of the bean depends largely 
upon the care taken during this process. Now the beans 
are dried in the sun, after which they are ready for 
exportation. 

Having been exported in this crude state, they must be 
cleaned, assorted, and roasted ; then the thin, brittle cov- 
erings removed by machinery. The thin coverings are 
sold under the name of cocoa shells. The broken roasted 
beans constitute cocoa nibs. Chocolate is the cocoa nibs 
crushed, pulverized, and moulded- Vanilla and sweet 



BEVERAGES. 73 

chocolates have the addition of sugar and flavoring. In 
the manufacture of cocoas nearly one-half of the fat is 
removed from cocoa nibs. 

Unlike tea and coffee, cocoa and chocolate, though 
slightly stimulating, have a food value which should not 
be overlooked.

The stimulating effect of cocoa is due to theobromine, 
a principle closely allied to thein and caffein; it also 
contains some tannin. 

Cocoa as a beverage may be used by many with whom 
tea and coffee disagree. There are some, however, who 
find it clogging and heavy on account of the large quan- 
tity of fat it contains. This is usually attributable to 
the fact that it is taken with a hearty meal. In cases 
of enfeebled digestion, cocoa usually agrees with the 
patient better than tea or coffee.

GRUELS, BEEF EXTRACTS, AND BEEF TEAS. 89 

CHAPTER Xm. 

GRUELS, BEEP EXTRACTS, AND BEEP TEAS. 

/GRUELS are cooked mixtures of cereal products and 
^* water, or milk and water. In preparing gruels the 
rules for the cooking of all starchy foods should be 
observed. Milk or cream, when used in the making of a 
gruel, should be added just before serving, as milk sub- 
jected to a high temperature for a long time is rendered 
more difficult of digestion. Most patients object to 
sweetened gruels, therefore avoid the use of sugar in their 
preparation. In exceptional cases, where it is called 
for, it may be used sparingly. Gruel should be well 
seasoned, served hot, and of such a consistency as to be 
taken through a syphon. 

Among gruels, Indian and oat meal take first rank as 
regards nutritive value. They are heat-producing and 
slightly laxative. Oatmeal gruel is frequently taken by 
nursing women to increase the milk supply. It is some- 
what more nutritious than an equal quantity of milk; 
besides, it has the advantage of offering variety to the 
diet in the form of liquid food. Indian meal gruel is 
often enjoyed by the aged and the consumptive. Barley 
gruel acts as an astringent; as do Thickened Milk and 
Cracker Gruel. 

Many preparations are on the market to use in the 
making of gruels, composed largely of dextrinized starch, 
malted barley, or evaporated milk. They have largely 
taken the place of the old-fashioned gruels, for, having 
been previously cooked, but a short time is required for 
their preparation. When malt is introduced it assists in 
the digestion of starch. When economy is considered, 
their use should be avoided, as they are expensive. 



90 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Beef extract is the expressed juices of beef. Beef tea 
is the expressed juices of beef diluted with water. Both 
are composed of water, fat, mineral matter, albuminous 
juices, and extractives (which give color and flavor). 
Extractives include creatin, creatinin, and allied com- 
pounds (sometimes called meat bases), which closely re- 
semble the thein in tea and the caffein in coffee and have 
a similar effect upon the nervous system. It is to these 
compounds that the value of beef extract and beef tea is 
largely attributable. While they contain a small amount 
of soluble albumen, the food value is so slight, they must 
be considered as stimulants rather than nutrients. 

Beef tea may be used to advantage. 

1. To give variety to a liquid diet. 

2. When much water is to be ingested. 

3. On account of the warmth that it gives. 

4. In cases of weakened digestion. 

It stimulates appetite. 
Meat extractives are the greatest known stimulants 
to gastric juice. 

Beef extract, being concentrated, may be retained 
often, if taken in small quantities at frequent intervals, 
where beef tea could not be borne; on the other hand, 
beef tea may be taken in larger quantities with satisfying 
effects, where beef extract would prove insufficient. 

Many preparations made from beef are on the market 
in the form of liquids, powders, meals, or pastes. To 
some of these a considerable amount of fat is added, 
which increases their nutritive value ; still others are use- 
ful only for the flavor and color they impart, and would 
find better place in the kitchen to be used in the making 
of soups and sauces than in the sick-room. 

Home-made beef tea, if carefully prepared, is usually 
liked better by a patient, costs much less, and, as a rule, 
is more nutritious than the manufactured article. It will 
keep without decomposition, however, but a short time. 

Physicians frequently order the preparations on the 
market, to give variety, and to try, if possible, to please 



GRUELS, BEEF EXTRACTS, AND BEEF TEAS. 91 

the patient. Again, if home-made beef tea is ordered he 
is in doubt as to the way in which it will be made, while 
the manufactured product is uniformly constant. 

It is never safe to resort to beef tea as the principal 
article of diet for more than a few days, as it would 
mean slow starvation to the patient. Milk, egg, cracker, 
or bread is added, frequently, to beef extract or beef tea 
to increase their food value. 

Beef, for the making of beef extract and beef tea, 
should be cut from the upper or lower part of the round 
of a heavy corn-fed steer. This insures good flavor and 
a large quantity of juice. One-half pound of such beef 
will yield two ounces (four tablespoons) of juice, making 
the price about five cents per ounce. The juice from the 
lower part of the round is quite as satisfactory and less 
expensive than that from the upper part. 

Beef extract may be served in a colored glass or small 
china cup. In this way the color, which is objectionable 
to many, may be concealed.

CHAPTER XIV. 
BREAD. 



BREAD may be called, without error of statement, 
" the staff of life," inasmuch as it is used by all 
civilized peoples as their staple article of food, and fur- 
nishes proteid, carbohydrate, mineral matter, and a small 
quantity of fat. The deficiency in fat is usually supplied 
by spreading bread with butter. 

Breads may be considered under two great classes : — 

I, Fermented, 

Made light by the use of a ferment, yeast usually 
being employed. 
2 Unfermented, 

Made light by the use of soda and cream of tartar, 
or baking powder. 

In either case the lightness is due to the development 
of carbon dioxid (C0 2 ). In the first instance this change 
is brought about during the process of fermentation. 
There are various kinds of fermentation, each of which is 
caused by special organisms. The organisms found in 
the yeast plant are the ones which apply to bread making. 
They have the power of changing starch to sugar, and 
sugar to alcohol aud carbon dioxid. In the second case 
the change is brought about by chemical reaction. By 
the action of moisture and heat, the gas in the bicarbonate 
of soda is liberated by the acid in the cream of tartar. 

The necessary ingredients for a loaf of bread are flour, 
water, and yeast. To these may be added shortening, 
salt, sugar, and milk. 

Bread made with water, flour, salt, and yeast keeps 
fresh longer, and is less liable to sour, than when milk is 
used for the wetting, but is of a tougher consistency, and 



BREAD. 97 

not as palatable. When shortening is added with either 
milk or water the bread is tenderer and better tasting. 
The addition of a little sugar — one tablespoon to six 
cups of flour — hastens the rising, and has no appreci- 
able effect on the taste. The United States Department of 
Agriculture, Farmer's Bulletin 112, recommends the use 
of milk for bread making, as it adds to the proteid as well 
as the fuel value of the loaf. 

Hard spring wheat flour is the best adapted to bread 
making, as it contains gluten in the right proportion to 
produce the spongy loaf. Gluten is the chief proteid of 
wheat. Its elastic, tenacious qualities, when mixed with 
water and acted upon by yeast, allow the gas formed to 
expand without danger of escape, making light the entire 
mass. The strength of a flour is determined largely by 
the quantity of gluten it contains. The larger the quantity 
of gluten, the more water it will take up, and the greater 
the yield in number of loaves to the barrel. 

Entire wheat, Graham, and white flour are all products 
of wheat. Entire wheat flour may be bought either fine 
or coarse. Graham flour is a dark flour product contain- 
ing a perceptible quantity of the coarse inner bran coats 
of the wheat. 

Rye flour ranks next to wheat flour for bread making 
purposes. It is of darker color, and its gluten is less 
elastic and tenacious. In making rye bread it is desirable 
to use white flour in combination with rye flour. 

Oats and barley are seldom used in the making of 
bread. Their gluten is even less tenacious than that of 
rye. From corn meal it is impossible to make a raised 
loaf, for none of its proteid is in the form of gluten.

98 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

From this table it may be seen that there is no appre- 
ciable difference between the fuel value of bread, whether 
made from white or entire wheat flour. Bread made from 
Graham flour contains so much of the bran coats of the 
wheat that it is forced through the digestive tract so 
quickly that absorption is less complete, and the system 
gets less nutritive value from it than from other breads. 
Nevertheless, there are times when its use is to be rec- 
ommended. If the intestines do their work slowly and 
incompletely, it acts as a stimulus to peristalsis. 

Yeast. 

Yeast is a minute single-celled plant of fungus growth 
which reproduces itself in two ways : — 

1. By sending out buds which break off as new plants. 

2. By forming spores which develop into new plants, 

under favorable conditions. 

Conditions most favorable for its growth : — 

1. Warmth (78° F.). 

2. Moisture. 

3. Sugar or starch converted into sugar. 

4. Nitrogenous soil. 

5. Oxygen. 

The most favorable temperature for the growth of the 
yeast plant is 78° F. Yeast is killed at a moist heat of 
140° F. or a dry heat of 212° F. Yeast will survive freez- 
ing temperature (32° F.), and if again placed under favor- 
able conditions will grow and thrive. 

While the yeast plant is active when well furnished with 
air, it is capable of obtaining a supply of oxygen by split- 
ting up sugar and starch. 

In bread making the side products of fermentation are 
almost as important as the carbon dioxid and alcohol, as 
they give flavor and aroma to the products. 

Wild yeast plants are found floating in the air, and it 
is by the cultivation of these that pure yeast cultures are 



BREAD. 99 

obtained. Standard brands of compressed yeast cakes 
are most satisfactory for bread making and are almost 
universally used. They coutain a larger number of yeast 
plants to a given bulk than any other form of yeast, either 
liquid or dry. 

Yeast cakes should be used only when fresh, and while 
they keep fresh but a few days, there is seldon difficulty 
in obtaining a satisfactory supply. A fresh yeast cake is 
known by its light color, and absence from dark streaks. 

Bread Making. 

Fermented bread is made by mixing to a dough flour, 
with a liquid (water, milk, or milk and water), salt, 
and a ferment (yeast), sugar being usually added to 
hasten fermentation. The dough is then kneaded until 
smooth, elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be seen on 
the surface, to thoroughly mix the ingredients, to distri- 
bute uniformly the yeast, and to incorporate air ; then 
covered for rising, and allowed to remain at a temperature 
of 69° to 78° F. until it doubles its bulk. During this 
time the yeast has produced a ferment which changes 
some of the starch to sugar, and the sugar in turn 
to alcohol and carbon dioxid. Still another ferment 
appears which peptonizes some of the gluten of the 
wheat. 

It is then cut down, and again kneaded, to break 
bubbles and distribute evenly the gas already formed. 
If allowed to rise too long the result will be a sour bread. 
If it is not convenient to shape the dough when it has 
doubled its bulk, it may be cut down, thus checking fer- 
mentation for the time being, then set in a cool place to 
let rise again. This may be done without injury to the 
finished loaf ; in fact many consider the second rising an 
improvement. Sour bread shows either lack of the knowl- 
edge of bread making or carelessness. 

Where bread is mixed in the morning, when one is able 
to keep a watch on it during the entire rising, a uniform 



100 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

temperature is best accomplished by placing bowl con- 
taining dough in a larger vessel of water kept at a tem- 
perature of 100° F. 

After the yeast has done its work (which is accom- 
plished when a certain amount of alcohol is produced) 
bacterial action begins, which gives rise to acetic, lactic, 
and butyric fermentation, which are the causes of sour 
bread. These micro-organisms may enter the mixture 
through the flour, water, or air, and a few are present in 
the yeast cake. Salt retards the action of bacteria. 

Quick rising, or five-hour bread, requires a larger quan- 
tity of yeast cake than bread which is allowed to rise 
over night, but is generally more satisfactory. There 
are, however, some who prefer the flavor obtained by the 
long rising. In the following recipes five-hour bread only 
will be considered. These recipes may be used where 
bread is allowed to rise over night if one-fourth yeast 
cake is allowed to each pint of liquid. 

A sponge is a mixture of liquid, flour, and yeast cake of 
such a consistency to pour or drop from a spoon. Many 
in making bread prefer first making a sponge, allowing 
that to rise until light, and then adding flour to knead. 



Shaping Bread Doughs. 

Bread dough, properly risen, is ready for shaping into 
loaves, biscuits, or rolls. Cut off dough the desired size, 
knead until smooth, avoiding seams underneath, place in 
buttered pan, cover, again let rise to double its bulk, when 
it is ready for baking. 

Biscuits or rolls may be shaped in a great variety of 
ways but always see to it that they are made small. Hot 
fresh raised bread is not a suitable article of diet for the 
sick and convalescent. 

Sometimes stale biscuits or rolls, reheated, may be used, 
and twice baked bread, in the form of pulled bread and 
Zwieback, is especially recommended. 



BREAD., SQ1; 

Baking of Bread. 

Bread is baked 

1. To kill the yeast plant (accomplished at 158° F.). 

2. To render the starch soluble. 

3. To drive off alcohol and carbon dioxid. 

4. To form a dextrinized crust of sweet, pleasant flavor. 
It is a common error to bake loaf bread insufficiently. 

While it requires a hot oven, it should continue to rise for 
about fifteen minutes after going into the oven, then the 
rising should cease and the loaf begin to brown. 

A loaf of bread of medium size requires from one to 
one and one-fourth hours for baking. 

Digestibility. 

Freshly baked bread cannot be sufficiently masticated 
to render it easy of digestion. Stale bread, from thirty- 
six to forty-eight hours old, if thoroughly masticated, is 
well digested and absorbed. 

Butter spread on bread not only increases its nutri- 
tive value, but tends to assist its digestibility. 

Water Bread. 

2 cups boiling water. \% teaspoons salt. 

\y 2 tablespoons butter. 1 yeast cake (dissolved in % 

1 tablespoon sugar. cup lukewarm water). 

6 cups sifted flour. 

Put butter, sugar, and salt in bowl without a lip. Pour 
on boiling water/ and when lukewarm add dissolved 
yeast cake and five cups flour, then stir until thoroughly 
mixed, using a knife or spoon. Add remaining flour, 
mix, and turn on a floured cloth ; knead, return to bowl, 
and cover with a cloth and board or tin cover. Let rise 
until mixture has doubled its bulk, cut down, toss on a 
floured cloth, knead, shapi', let rise again, and bake. Re- 
move from pan, place side down on wire rack, that the 
air may have an opportunity to circulate around it. If a 



1-02 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

soft crust is desired, cover with a towel. Avoid putting 
in bread box until thoroughly cooled, as it keeps better, 
and is less liable to become mouldy. Never wrap bread 
in a cloth, as the cloth will absorb moisture and transmit 
an unpleasant taste to the bread. 

Pulled Bread. 
Make Water Bread in long loaves, so that the grain of 
the bread extends the entire length of the loaf. Remove 
crusts while bread is warm, and pull bread apart in stick- 
shape pieces of uniform size. Put sticks in pan and 
bake in a slow oven until thoroughly dried and delicately 
browned.

dissolved yeast cake and flour. Beat thoroughly, cover, 
and let rise. Again beat, and turn into buttered bread 
pans, having pans one-half full. Let rise, and bake. 
Graham bread should not quite double its bulk during the 
last rising. A satisfactory way of making this bread is 
to first make a sponge of the white flour and when well 
risen add molasses and Graham flour.

and color a golden brown, first on one side, then on other. 



BREAD. 107 

The moisture in the bread should be nearly evaporated, 
thus making the toast dry and crisp. By this means of 
toasting some of the starch becomes dextrinized, and 
the bread is thus rendered easier of digestion. If only 
charred on the outside and soft in the inside, it forms in 
the stomach a soggy, indigestible mass. 

Toast should never be piled one slice on another, except 
it be cut in suitable shapes, that it may be piled log-cabin 
fashion. If a toast rack is not at hand, balance toast 
against cup placed in warm plate until serving time. 

If toast is desired in finger-shaped pieces, triangles, or

BREAKFAST CEREALS. 109 



CHAPTER XV. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS. 

"DREAKFAST cereals are made from oats, corn, wheat, 
■■-^ or rice. At the present time so great is the number 
upon the market, that one has an extensive variety from 
which to choose. They are put up in one or two pound 
packages, almost all of them having been partially cooked. 
Printed directions are given for the cookiug, the time for 
which is always insufficient. 

Breakfast cereals are valuable, inexpensive foods, and 
their daily use is strongly recommended. It is a fact to 
be regretted that they are not more freely employed by 
the poorer classes in our own country.

Bulletin 28, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Oat preparations rank first as regards nutritive value. 
They contain a stimulating principle which is lacking in 
the other cereals. Owing to the fact that they hold a 
large amount of fat and cellulose, there are many with 
whom they disagree. In such cases their use should be 
avoided. As regards heat-giving properties, corn ranks 
next to oats, therefore both are especially adapted for a 
winter diet. They are slightly laxative. 



110 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

A kernel of wheat is deficient in but one of the five 
food principles, namely fat, to make it an ideal food. 
For this reason wheat preparations may be used to advan- 
tage throughout the year. It is a fact that wheat is more 
largely consumed than any other cereal, rice holding 
second place. 

Rice contains more starch and less fat than any of the 
cereals. It has a delicate flavor, but is not as popular in 
the United States, except in the southern part, as wheat, 
oats, or corn. 

Macaroni is made from wheat flour rich in proteid, and 
water. It is manufactured to some extent in this country, 
but the best brands come from Italy. Like the cereals, 
it is an inexpensive, nutritive food. 

All the cereals contain a large percentage of starch, in 
consequence of which they should be thoroughly cooked. 
The following points must be followed for the best results : 

1. Double boiler, the utensil for cooking. 

2. Correct proportions of water, cereal, and salt. 

3. Temperature of water, boiling point (212° F.). 

4. Time for cooking. 

5. Manner of serving. 

In cooking cereals the double boiler employed should 
correspond in size to the quantity to be prepared. The 
following recipesc all for the use of the smallest ones 
put upon the market. 

Oftentimes where cereals have not proved popular, it is 
due to the fact that they have been improperly cooked or 
have been served with poor milk, rather than with rich 
milk or thin cream. To avoid monotony, vary the kind 
of cereal, never allowing the same preparation to appear 
on consecutive mornings. 

Digestibility. 
Breakfast cereals, if properly cooked, are well digested 
and absorbed, holding close rank to animal foods. Of the 
protein there is a loss of fifteen per cent ; of the fat, ten 
per cent ; of the carbohydrate, two per cent.

CHAPTER XVI. 
EGGS. 

AN egg consists of the shell, the membrane which lies 
next the shell, the white, and the yolk, the yolk 
being balanced in the white by means of two spiral 
springs. On the yolk of a fertile egg can be found a spot 
which is the germ.

Farmer's Bulletin No. 128, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Eggs furnish a valuable, concentrated proteid food and 
are a useful substitute for meat. They are deficient in 
but one of the five food principles — namely, carbohy- 
drates. From this fact, it may be plainly seen that they 
should be taken in combination with some starchy food, 
which furnishes the necessary bulk for the stomach. 

The proteid found in the white of egg is nearly pure 
albumen. The yolk is of much greater nutritive value 
than the white. Its chemical composition is so complex 
that as yet it is but incompletely understood. It contains 
lime, calcium, iron, and phosphorus iu organic combina- 
tions, which renders it readily absorbed and utilized by 
the body. 

Eggs are expensive, even when obtained at twenty-five 
cents per dozen, but being so valuable a form of food,

they should be used as freely as possible. They enter 
into the composition of many dishes to which they are 
indispensable. 

Eggs for the sick should be as fresh as possible. If 
received from the market, packed in sawdust, they should 
be removed at once, as they quickly absorb odor from the 
wood, which gives to them an unpleasant flavor. If a 
patient should by chance be served an egg-nog made from 
a poor egg it might be difficult to persuade him to try 
another. 

There are but few people with whom eggs disagree. If 
they cannot be taken it is usually due to the presence of 
lecithin, a nitrogenous, fatty substance found in the yolk 
which readily decomposes and forms acids. Convales- 
cents, ansemics, aud consumptives can take from six to 
eight eggs daily, for an extended period, with most satis- 
factory results, as they yield a large amount of nutriment 
for their bulk. For forced feeding they are most valuable, 
as they can be easily administered and combined with 
milk or broth. 

Eggs deteriorate quickly in value unless air is excluded, 
which prevents the evaporation of water through the shell. 
By the evaporation of water air rushes in, causing decom- 
position. Various gases are given off, — principally, 
sulphuretted hydrogen, which may cause gastric and in- 
testinal disorders. 

How preserved. 

1. By the exclusion of air by coating, covering, or 

immersing. 

2. By use of low temperature ; that is, cold storage. 



Ways of determining Freshness of 

1. The shell of a freshly laid egg is slightly rough. 

2. Shake egg in hand while holding to ear, and there 

should be but little sound. 

3. Put in basin of water and they should sink. 



EGGS. 117 

Dealers determine the freshness of eggs by holding 
them in front of an electric light or lighted candle in a 
dark room. If they look clear the eggs are fresh ; if a 
dark spot is in evidence the eggs are doubtful. The air 
space at the larger end of a freshly laid egg is quite small, 
but increases as the egg loses value. An egg deterio- 
rates after twenty-four hours. 

Advantages of use in Sick-Room Cookery. 

1. Nutritive value. 

2. Taste good (if fresh). 

3. Easily digested (if properly cooked). 

4. Free from bacteria. 

5. Contain practically no extractives. 

6. Deficient in uric acid derivatives. 

7. Hold lime, calcium, iron, and phosphorus in organic 

combination. 
Minerals in organic combination are more easily 
absorbed. 

8. Fat in form of emulsion. 

Effects of Cooking. 

The white of an egg being nearly pure albumen, serves 
as an excellent illustration for demonstrating the effect of 
heat on the principal constituent of proteid food. Illus- 
trate by experiments. 

1. Albumen is soluble in cold water. 

2. Albumen is coagulated by hot water (134 to 167° F.) 

or by heat. 

3. Albumen is coagulated by mineral acids. 

4. Albumen is dissolved by vegetable acids. 

Exception, Cream of Tartar. 

5. Albumen is coagulated by alcohol. 

Albumen when acted upon by heat coagulates at a tem- 
perature of from 134 to 1G7° F. ; herein lies the necessity 
of cooking eggs alone or in combination at a low tem- 
perature. 



118 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The importance of this truth is best illustrated by the 
proper preparation of so-called " boiled eggs." If the 
egg is kept at a low temperature throughout the cooking, 
the white is soft and jelly like. Whereas, if the tempera- 
ture is greatly increased, the white is tough and leathery. 
The yolk of the egg will cook at a relatively lower tem- 
perature than the white. In the former case the egg is 
readily digested ; in the latter case it is difficult of diges- 
tion. Eggs for the sick, if served boiled, should be either 
soft or hard cooked, never midway between. If "hard 
boiled," the yolk may be reduced readily to a powder, 
which is not difficult of digestion. 

Digestibility. 

Eggs are easily digested and well absorbed. Ninety- 
seven per cent of the proteid is absorbed and ninety-four 
per cent of the fat. A raw egg, on account of its bland- 
ness, does not stimulate the flow of gastric juice, conse- 
quently does not leave the stomach in so short a time as 
a "soft cooked" egg. Exception must be made to the 
uncooked white of egg which requires so little digestion 
that it is almost ready for absorption. 

Two " soft boiled " eggs leave the stomach in one and 
three-fourths hours. 

Two raw eggs leave the stomach in two and one- 
fourth hours. 

Two "hard boiled" eggs (as commonly taken) leave 
the stomach in three hours. A " hard boiled " egg cooked 
at a low temperature (175° F.) for forty-five minutes, and 
chopped very finely, will leave the stomach almost as 
quickly as a "soft boiled" egg. 

The digestibility of the white of an egg is increased 
by beating. By beating, the walls of the cells, which 
consist of albuminin, are ruptured, thus setting free 
the albumen, which is more quickly acted upon by the 
gastric juice.

SOUPS, BROTHS, AND STEWS. 127 



CHAPTER XVII. 
SOUPS, BROTHS, AND STEWS. 
COUPS are usually divided into two great classes : — 

1. Those made with stock. 

2. Those made without stock. 

Soups made with stock have for their basis beef, 
mutton, veal, poultry, fish or game, separately or in com- 
bination. They include bouillon, brown soup stock, 
consomme\ lamb stock, and white soup stock. These 
should be made in large quantities and require much time 
and care in their preparation. Recipes may be found for 
the same in any reliable cook book. 

Stock soups are valuable chiefly for their extractives. 
When taken as the first course of a dinner they stimulate 
gastric juice to such an extent that the solid foods which 
follow are much more readily digested than they other- 
wise would be. They are also useful to give variety to 
a liquid diet. 

Soups without stock usually have as their basis cooked 
vegetables, forced through a strainer, diluted with stock 
and milk or milk alone. Cream soups have a food value, 
largely due to the milk and butter which they contain, the 
vegetables being added for the purpose of giving flavor, 
with the exception of peas and beans, which increase nutri- 
tive value.

Triplex Soup. 

Use equal quantities of beef, lamb, or mutton and veal, 
allowing one pint water to each pound of meat. Cut 
meat in small pieces, add cold water, heat slowly to boil-

remove fat, and reheat for serving. Season with salt. 

Doctors frequently order this soup for patients. 

Mutton Broth. 

3 lbs. lamb, cut from 2 tablespoons boiled rice, 

forequarter. or barley. 

3 pints cold water. 1 teaspoon salt. 

"Wipe meat, remove from bones, discard skin and fat,

kettle, add water, heat gradually to boiling point, skim, 
and cook slowly until meat is tender. Add salt when 
half cooked. Strain, remove fat, reheat, and add cooked 
rice. It is sometimes desirable to force rice through a 
puree strainer. It is more satisfactory to cook rice 
separately in boiling salted water before adding to broth. 
If cooked in broth it absorbs a large quantity of the 
liquid. When barley is used, soak over night or several 
hours before cooking. A few mint leaves or a sprig of 
parsley may be added to give additioual flavor.

CHAPTER XVIU. 

FISH. 

T^ISH, commonly speaking, is sea food. Fish is at its 
•*- best when fresh, and in season. It should be eaten 
as soon as possible after being taken from the water. If 
fish is fresh the eyes and gills are bright, the tail firm, the 
flesh hard, and the scales do not come off easily. 
Fish may be classified : 

I. Scaly. 

1. White fish (fat secreted in liver). 

Examples : haddock, halibut, turbot, floun- 
der, etc. 

2. Oily fish (fat deposited throughout the body). 

Examples : bluefish, eels, mackerel, salmon, 
etc. 

II. Shell Fish. 

1. Mollusks. Examples: oysters, clams, etc. 

2. Crustaceans. Examples : crab, lobster, and 

shrimp. 

The protein and fat of fish, as of meat, are their chief 
nutritive constituents. A large amount of the protein of 
fish is in the form of gelatin. Fish is less rich in extrac- 
tives and less stimulating than meat, for which reason 
people tire of it more quickly. It offers variety rather 
than furnishes a constant diet. Fish is less nutritious 
than meat, with the exception of the oily fish, — salmon, 
eels, herrings, etc. 

The popular fallacy that fish is a brain food is un- 
founded. As a matter of fact many kinds of meat con- 
tain more phosphorus than any kind of fish. There is 
no special brain food.

Under scaly fish, white fish is the only class usually 
considered in invalid cookery. Exception must be made 
to codfish, which on account of its coarse fibre is never 
allowed. During advanced convalescence, oily fish may 
be occasionally introduced into the dietary. 

Oysters, among mollusks, take first rank. The five food 
principles are represented in their composition, and in 
about the same proportion as in milk. 

Their carbohydrate is in the form of glycogen (animal 
starch). Milk has the advantage over oysters as a 
food, as it is much cheaper and may be taken in large 
quantities. Oysters are taken in such limited numbers 
they furnish a comparatively small amount of nutri- 
ment; they are, however, if eaten raw, very easily 
digested. They offer a pleasing variety to the diet on 
account of their delicious flavor. They may be cooked 



136 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

in a great variety of ways, which enables them to be used 
to advantage. 

Frequently oysters are of a greenish color, which is due 
not to parasites, as many suppose, but to the green color- 
ing matter in the plant on which the oysters have fed. 

Oysters are in season from September to May. During 
the remaining months, which is their breeding season, 
they are flabby and of inferior flavor. While many believe 
them to be injurious when out of season, this is not the 
case, if they are eaten soon after being taken from the 
oyster beds. 

Clams are similar in composition to oysters, but are not 
so generally used, nor so well liked. They contain a tough 
portion, which should be discarded in sick-room cookery. 

While analysis shows the nutritive value of lobsters to 
be considerable, they are coarse feeders, which renders 
the fibre dense and close, making them difficult of diges- 
tion. Lobsters, on account of their price, must be con- 
sidered as a delicacy, except in places where they are 
abundant, and even in such places lobsters of short length 
are frequently sold, which is contrary to law. The United 
States is endeavoring to protect the lobster industry by 
forbidding the sale of all lobsters under certain lengths, 
(which lengths differ in different states), ten inches being 
the shortest. 

As a rule, the use of lobsters in the sick-room should 
not be considered. To many they are poisonous, and to 
others with whom they agree they have a decidedly appe- 
tizing effect ; to the latter class they are allowed occa- 
sionally during convalescence. 

Salt codfish, on account of its low price and high 
nutritive value, is a most important form of food. When 
finely divided and served as creamed codfish, it may fur- 
nish the principal dish to a most satisfactory meal. 

Cooking of. 
The same principles which apply to the cooking of meat 
apply also to the cooking of fish, and the same methods 



FISH. 137 

for cooking should be employed. Fish, being less rich ia 
extractives than meat, usually needs the accompaniment 
of some kind of a sauce. 

Digestibility. 

White fish, as a rule, are more easily digested than beef, 
lamb, or chicken. For this reason their use is often recom- 
mended for those of sedentary habits. They furnish a 
desirable substitute for the more stimulating meats during 
warm weather. 

Oily fish are digested with about the same ease and in 
about the same time as meats containing a relatively 
small quantity of fat. 

Salt fish is less easily digested than other fish, due to 
the fact that the fibre is hardened during the process of 
salting. 

While there is a tendency to carry personal idiosyn- 
crasies too far, there are undoubtedly many by whom fish 
cannot be taken. It acts as a poison, oftentimes produc- 
ing diseases of the skin. There are others with whom the 
fat of fish disagrees, causing acidity and eructation of the 
stomach. 

WAYS OF COOKING. 

Steamed Halibut. 

Clean a small piece of halibut by wiping with a cheese 
cloth wrung out of cold water. Put in strainer, and place 
over a kettle of boiling water, cover closely, and keep 
water at boiling point until fish is doue. The fish is 
cooked when flesh leaves the bone. Remove to hot 
serving-dish, take off outside skin, and pour around 

Drawn Butter Sauce. Melt three-fourths tablespoon 
butter, add three-fourths tablespoon flour, and when well 
mixed pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, one- 
half cup boiling water. Season with salt, then add three- 
fourths tablespoon butter in small pieces, and one-half 



138 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Boiled Haddock. 



Clean and wipe a small piece of haddock, then tie in 
cheese cloth. Put on trivet placed in stewpan of boiling 
water to which has been added one tablespoon each salt 
and vinegar, having water cover fish. 

Salt adds to the flavor ; vinegar helps to keep the fish 
white. Cook until flesh separates from bone, the time 
required being about fifteen minutes. Place on hot serv- 
ing-dish, remove skin, garnish with parsley, and serve 
with 

Egg Sauce. Melt three-fourths tablespoon butter, add 
three- fourths tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually one- 
half cup scalded milk. Beat yolk one egg, dilute with one 
tablespoon hot mixture, add to remaining mixture, and 
season with salt. 

Broiled Pish. 

Smelts and other small fish are broiled whole, some- 
times being split; while larger fish are cut in slices three- 
fourths inch in thickness for broiling. 

Wipe fish, sprinkle with salt, and put in buttered wire 
broiler, place over hot fire, turning every ten seconds 
during the first minute of the cooking (to coagulate the 
albuminous juices, thus preventing their escape), and 
afterwards occasionally. 

When fish is thoroughly heated, brush over, without 
unlocking broiler, with melted butter, first on one side 
then on the other. Cook until well browned on both 
sides, remove to hot serving-dish, sprinkle with salt, 
spread with soft butter, and garnish with parsley and 
lemon cut in fancy shapes. 

Small fish, when spilt for broiling, should be first broiled 
on flesh side, then turned and browned on skin side just 
long enough to malce sKin brown and crisp. To remove 
fish from broiler, loosen fish on one side, turn, and loosen 
on other side, using a three-tined fork.

144 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Structure of Meat. 



Meat is made up of bundles of fibres (tube-shaped cells) 
containing water which holds in solution proteins, extrac- 
tives, and salt to such an extent that the whole is jelly- 
like in consistency. The walls of the cells consist of an 
albuminoid substance called elastin. The bundles of 
fibres are held together by connective tissue, a gelatinous 
substance called collogen. 

Between the fibres is found soluble albumen. 

The protein of meat consists of different nitrogenous 
substances which take different names : Myosin, the basis 
of muscle ; fibrin, found in the muscle and the blood; and 
albumen, found in the blood and juices. Fibrin causes blood 
to clot. Gelatin is obtained from connective tissue, tendon, 
cartilage, and bone by boiling with water. Collogen is the 
name given to gelatin in its raw state. Gelatin, although 
highly nitrogenous, cannot fill the place of albumen, but 
spares it to such an extent that it is ranked in food 
classification among the proteins. It is capable of build- 
ing tissues to a small extent, when taken in large 
quantities. 

All meats contain extractives. These and dextrin of 
starch are the only substances that can alone start the flow 
of digestive juices. They have a stimulating effect upon 
the system, and while they have but little food value, are 
of great importance, as to them is due the characteristic 
flavor of all meats. Pawlow writes : " They are the most 
powerful exciters of gastric secretion." The flesh of ma- 
ture animals is richer in extractives than the flesh of 
young animals. 

The fat of meat is intermingled with the lean portion 
or occurs in masses under the skin or about the internal 
organs. The nutritive value of meat depends largely 
upon the quantity of fat it contains. The larger the pro- 
portion of fat, the smaller the proportion of water, the 
fat supplementing the water. 

Phosphoric acid and potash are the chief mineral sub- 
stances found in meat. They are very valuable as build- 



MEAT. 145 

ing material, and where there is an insufficient supply the 
muscles are poorly developed. 

The protein of meat is the most expensive form in 
which protein can be obtained, unless it be from the 
cheapest cuts. Cheap cuts, if properly cooked, are as 
easily digested and well absorbed as the more expensive 
ones, and their u^ e should be encouraged. The art of 
good cookery is here well emphasized. 
Beef. 

Beef ranks first among meats as regards nutritive value 
and consumption. This may be due in part to the fact 
that people tire less quickly of it than of other meats. 
The opinion is held that the red meats hold the more ex- 
tractives, consequently are more stimulating than the 
white meats ; this, however, is repudiated by Van Noor- 
den, who claims there is little difference between red and 
white meats extractives. 

How to determine Good Beef. 

The quality of beef depends upon the breed, environ- 
ment, age, and care in feeding of the animal, and also the 
manner of transportation and the time of hanging of the 
meat. The best beef is obtained from a steer of four or 
five years of age. The creature should hang after killing 
from two to three weeks. During this time lactic acid is 
formed, which acts upon the connective tissue, and the 
meat becomes tender and develops new flavors. First 
quality beef is firm and of fine-grained texture, bright red 
in color, and well mottled and coated with fat. The fat 
is firm and of a yellowish color. 

Veal is obtained from the calf, and should never be 
used in the sick-room except for the making of broths. 
It comes from an immature animal, therefore contains but 
little nutritive value, and is difficult of digestion, in this 
latter respect being an exception to the general rule. 

A sweetbread, the thymus gland of the calf, consists of 
two parts connected by tubing and membrane. The 



146 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

round compact part is called the heart sweetbread ; the 
other portion, the throat sweetbread. They should never be 
bought disconnected, as the heart sweetbread is the more 
desirable. A sweetbread is made up of proteid and fat 
with but little connective tissue. Its proteid contains 
nucleiu, which in digestion gives rise to uric acid deriva- 
tives ; therefore its use should be restricted in the dietary 
of a patient who already has an excess of uric acid in the 
system. 

Sweetbreads are the most easily digested of all meats, 
with but one exception, namely, calf's brains, which are 
very poorly absorbed. Sweetbreads are in season dur- 
ing the late spring and early summer. While they are 
obtainable throughout the year, they are very expensive in 
city markets when out of season.

A SIDE OF BEEF. 



Mutton and Lamb. 

Mutton is commonly ranked next to beef in nutritive 
value and consumption. According to some authorities 
it holds an equal place, aud English writers on the sub- 
ject often give it the preference. All agree that the fat 
of mutton is more difficult of digestion than the fat of 
beef. Lamb is young mutton. When coming from a 
creature killed at the age of from six weeks to three 
months, it is called spring lamb. Spring lamb appears in 
the market as early as February or March, and commands 
a very high price. 



148 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

How to determine Good Mutton and Lamb. 

First-quality mutton comes from a sheep about three 
years old, and like beef should be allowed to hang to 
ripen and develop flavor. Good mutton is fine graiued, 
bright pink in color, and the fat is hard, white, and flaky. 
If the skin comes off easily, mutton is sure to be good. 
Lamb should not be allowed to hang, but should be sold 
soon after killing. A leg of lamb may be distinguished 
from a leg of mutton, as the bone at the joint is serrated, 
rather than smooth and rounded. Lamb chops may be 
readily distinguished from mutton chops by the red color 
of the bone. As the creature grows old the blood re- 
cedes from the bone, therefore in mutton the bone is 
white. A lamb one year old is called a yearling, and fur- 
nishes lamb, while an older animal furnishes mutton. 

Pork. 

Pork as ordinarily considered is the most difficult of 
digestion of all meats, and in health should seldom be 
used, while in the sick-room it should never be permitted. 
Many cases of ptomaine poisoning have been reported 
from its use. Exception must be made, however, to ham, 
salt pork, and bacon. A tnin slice of broiled ham, baked 
bacon, or broiled salt pork are well borne by people in the 
early stages of convalescence, the salty taste acting as a 
stimulant to restore lost appetite. The manner of cutting 
and cooking is of the utmost importance. 

Poultry and Game. 

Poultry includes the domestic birds, while game includes 
the birds and animals which are hunted for food. 

Chicken, fowl, turkey, squab, and quail are allowed in 
the dietary of the sick. 

A chicken is recognized by its soft feet, smooth skin, 
soft cartilage at the end of the breastbone, and frequently, 
by the abundance of pin-feathers. 



MEAT. 1-49 

In fowl the feet arc hard and dry, the cartilage at the 
end of the breastbone is firm, and pin-feathers have given 
place to long hairs. 

Chicken is more easily digested than fowl, but has not 
so great nutritive value. The breast of chicken has very 
short fibres, a small amount of connective tissue, and is 
practically free from fat. It is one of the most easily 
digested cuts of meat. Squabs and quails are likewise 
easily digested, and may be introduced into the dietary of 
a convalescent quite as early as chicken. 

Effects of Cooking. 

Stewing, broiling, roasting, and baking are the methods 
employed in the cooking of meats for the sick. 

The method depends on the cut as well as the result to 
be obtained. 

In the cooking there is a loss of water, mineral matter, 
fat, and some extractives, the greatest loss being in water ; 
consequently cooked meat represents more nutritive value, 
weight for weight, than raw meat.

Cold water draws out the soluble albumen, the extrac- 
tives, and some of the salts of meat. By gradually rais- 
ing the temperature and keepiug it at 185° F. for several 
hours, gelatin is obtained from connective tissue and

bone. In soup making this is the object to be accom- 
plished. When meat is to be served with the broth, as 
in the case of a stew, it should be put on in cold water, 
brought quickly to the boiling point (212° F.), then al- 
lowed to simmer (185° F.) until the meat is tender. The 
cheaper cuts should always be used for soups and stews. 

In broiling, baking, or roastiug the object is to avoid, 
as far as possible, the loss of nutritive value from the 
meat. This is accomplished by subjecting the meat to a 
high temperature, thus searing the surface as quickly as 
possible, which causes the albumen to coagulate. 
Digestibility. 

Meat is easily digested and well absorbed. 

Experiments have shown that raw meat is more readily 
digested than cooked meat, but, lacking in taste and flavor, 
would soon become unbearable if introduced into the daily 
dietary. Protein is made somewhat less digestible by 
cooking. 

The digestibility of meat depends upon the length and 
thickness of the individual fibres, the quantity of fat 
between the fibres, and the hardness and denseness of 
connecting tissues. Jessen has found that beef and 
mutton are digested in the same time. It cannot be 
denied, however, that the fat of mutton is more difficult 
of digestion than the fat of beef, owing to the larger 
quantity of stearic acid present. 

The meat of young animals (veal excepted) is more 
easily digested but less nutritious than the meat of older 
animals — as the walls of the muscle tubes are more deli- 
cate and there is less connective tissues. 

WAYS OF COOKING. 

Beef Balls. 

Wipe a small piece steak cut from top of round, and 

cut in one-fourth inch strips. Lay strips on board and 

scrape separately, using a silver spoon, with grain of 

meat first on one side and then on other, to remove soft 



MEAT. 151 

part of meat, leaving the connective tissue. Form into 
small balls, handling as lightly as possible. Heat a steel 
omelet pan, sprinkle with salt, shake constantly while 
adding balls, and continue shaking until the surface of 
balls is seared. Arrange on buttered toast and garnish 
with parsley. 

Scraped Beef on Crackers. 

3 tablespoons scraped beef. 4 unsweetened circular 

Salt. wafer crackers. 

2 teaspoons butter. 

Prepare beef according to directions given for Beef 
Balls. Season to taste with salt. Divide beef evenly and 
put roughly on tops of crackers, making several depressions 
in each. Put in a hot oven and let stand until beef has a 
cooked appearance on outside and is slightly heated 
through. Remove from oven, put dots of butter in de- 
pressions. Place in oven and let stand long enough to 
melt the butter. Remove to plate and serve at once. 

Beef in Cream on Toast. 
% cup cream. Salt. 

3 tablespoons scraped beef. 1 slice dry toast. 

Heat cream, add beef, and cook until meat is disc.olored, 
stirring constantly. Season to taste, pour over toast and 
serve at once. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

"Wipe a small piece steak cut one inch thick. Heat a 
wire broiler, put in steak, and place over a clear fire, 
turning every ten seconds for the first minute that surface 
may be well soared, thus preventing escape of juices. 
After the first minute turn occasionally until well cooked 
on both sides. Cook five minutes if liked rare. Remove 
to hot serving-dish, spread with soft butter, and sprinkle 
with salt. The most tender steaks are tenderloin, rump, 
and sirloin. A tenderloin steak lacks juice and flavor; 
for this reason it is often served with Beef Extract I. 



152 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

(see p. 86) poured over it. A thick slice of sirloin steak 
with tenderloin attached is known in our markets as a 
Porterhouse Steak. A round steak is composed of solid 
lean meat, rich in juices, and if of right age and taken 
from second or third cut from top of round, is compara- 
tively tender, and cheaper than either rump or sirloin. 

Pan Broiled Beef Cakes. 

Wipe and finely chop two ounces steak from upper part 
of round, season with salt, and shape in a flat, circular 
cake, using as little pressure as possible. Heat small 
omelet pan, rub over with fat, put in meat, and turn as 
soon as under surface is seared, then turn and sear other 
side. Cook five minutes, turning occasionally, using a 
griddle cake turner that surface may not be pierced. 
Brush over with soft butter and sprinkle with salt. 

Broiled Lamb Chops. 

Wipe chops, remove superfluous fat, and place in 
broiler rubbed over with some of the fat. Follow direc- 
tions for Broiled Beefsteak (see p. 142). When loin 
chops are used, remove flank and reserve for soup mak- 
ing. The loin chop contains meat on either side of 
bone and corresponds to the Porterhouse steak in the 
beef creature. 

Pan Broiled French Chop. 

Select rib chops, and scrape the bone clean nearly to 
the lean meat, thus making French chops. Put in a 
hissing-hot frying-pan rubbed over with fat. Sear on 
one side, turn and sear other side. Cook six minutes if 
liked rare, eight minutes if liked well done. Turn often 
while cooking, using knife and fork, that the surface may 
not be pierced, as would be liable if fork alone were used. 
Let stand around edge of frying-pan to brown outside 
fat. When half cooked, sprinkle with salt. Drain on 
brown paper, remove to serving-dish, spread with soft 
butter, sprinkle with salt, and stack around a mound of 



MEA.T. 153 

mashed potato, potato balls, or green peas. Trim each 
chop bone with a paper frill. 

Broiled Sweetbread. 

Put sweetbread in bowl, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one hour; drain, remove fat, pipes, and membrane. 
Cook in boiling salted acidulated water twenty minutes, 
allowing one-half tablespoon each salt and viuegar to a 
pair of sweetbreads, then drain again and plunge into cold 
water. 

Sweetbreads cooked in this way are called parboiled 
sweetbreads. This is the first step taken, no matter in 
what way sweetbreads are to be prepared. 

Remove sweetbread from cold water, dry on a towel, 
split one-half sweetbread lengthwise, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, place on a greased fine wire broiler, and 
broil over a clear fire. As soon as sweetbread is heated, 
brush sparingly with melted butter, first on one side, then 
on other. For serving, spread with soft butter, sprinkle 
with salt, and garnish with parsley. 

Creamed Sweetbread. 

Parboil sweetbread and cut in one-half inch cubes. 
To one-third cup cubes add one-fourth cup White Sauce 
made as follows : 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add three-fourths 
tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring 
constantly, one-fourth cup milk. Season with salt and 
few grains pepper. Serve in Croustades of Bread (see 
p. 99). 

Glazed Sweetbread. 

Parboil one-half sweetbread, preferably the heart 
sweetbread. Place in individual baking-dish, and sprinkle 
with salt. Dissolve one teaspoon beef extract in one and 
one-half tablespoons boiling water. Pour one-third mix- 
ture over sweetbread, put in hot oven and bake until well 
glazed, basting three 'times with remaining mixture. 
Serve with a border of peas. 



154 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Jellied Sweetbread. 

Parboil one-half sweetbread and cut in small dice. 
Have at one hand one-third cup consomme that %ill jell 
when cold. Cover bottom of an individual mould with 
consomme, set mould in pan of ice water, and when con- 
somme is firm, decorate with cold cooked potato, carrot, 
and truffle cut in fancy shapes. Cover with consomme, 
and when firm put in layer of sweetbread and enough 
consomme to hold cubes together. Decorate sides of 
mould with cooked vegetables and add more sweetbread 
and consomme. Chill, remove from mould, and place on 
lettuce leaf. 

Chicken stock may be used in place of consomme by 
adding gelatin to stiffen. 

Broiled Ham I. 

Remove outside layer of fat from small piece of ham, 
cut one-third inch thick, and soak one-half hour in luke- 
warm water ; drain, wipe, and broil three minutes. 

Broiled Ham II. 

Prepare ham as for Broiled Ham I., put in hissing-hot 
omelet pan, cook one minute on one side, turn and cook 
one minute on other side. Drain on brown paper and 
serve at once. 

Bacon. 

Cut bacon in as thin slices as possible and remove 
rind. Place slices closely together in a fine wire broiler, 
place broiler over dripping-pan, and bake in a hot oven 
until bacon is crisp and brown, turning once. Drain on 
brown paper. 

Curled Bacon. 

Cut bacon in as thin slices as possible and remove rind. 
Put slices on board, pass a broad-bladed knife over each

slice two or three times, using some pressure, thus mak- 
ing slices still thinner. Put in hot omelet pan one slice 
at a time, when slices will curl. Cook until brown, then 
drain. 

Broiled Chicken. 

Order chicken split for broiling. Singe, wipe, sprinkle 
with salt, and place on a well-greased broiler. Broil 
twenty minutes over a clear fire, watching carefully and 
turning broiler so that all parts may be browned equally. 
The flesh side needs the longer exposure to the fire. The 
skin side cooks quickly and then is liable to burn. 'Re- 
move to hot platter, spread with soft butter, and sprinkle 
with salt. 

So much time and attention is required for broiling 
a chicken that the work is often simplified by placing 
chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down, sprinkling with 
salt, dotting over with butter, and cooking fifteen minutes 
in a hot oven, then removing to broiler to finish the 
cooking. 

Maryland Chicken. 

Dress, clean, and disjoint one-half broiler. Sprinkle 
with salt, dip in flour, egg (slightly beaten and diluted 
with two tablespoons cold water), and soft stale bread 
crumbs. Place in a well-greased dripping-pan and bake 
twenty minutes in a hot oven, bastiug after first five 
minutes of cooking with two tablespoons melted butter. 
Arrange on serving-dish and pour around one-half cup 
White Sauce made as follows : 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add one tablespoon 
flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, 
one-half cup thin cream. Season with salt. 

Roast Chicken. 

Dress, clean, and truss a small chicken. Place on back 
on rack in dripping-pan. Rub entire surface with salt, 



156 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

and spread breast and legs with one and one-half table- 
spoons butter rubbed until creamy and mixed with one 
and one-half tablespoons flour. Dredge bottom of pan 
with flour. Place in hot oven, and when flour is well 
browned, reduce heat, then baste chicken. Continue bast- 
ing every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For 
basting use two tablespoons butter melted in one-half 
cup boiling water, and after this is gone use fat in pan. 
During cooking, chicken must be turned frequently, that 
it may brown evenly. Made gravies are rich, difficult of 
digestion, and not adapted for invalid cookery ; therefore 
the recipe for the making of gravy is omitted. 

Creamed Chicken. 

Cut cold broiled fowl in one-third inch cubes; there 
should be one-third cup. Add to White Sauce made as 
follows : 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add three-fourths 
tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring 
constantly, one-fourth cup milk. Season with salt, pepper, 
and celery salt. 

Chicken Timbale. 

Remove piece of breast meat from an uncooked chicken, 
chop finely, then force through a fine strainer, using a 
wooden potato masher; there should be two tablespoons. 
Pound in mortar, add gradually one-half egg white, and 
work until smooth. Then add gradually one-fourth cup 
heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Turn into 
a slightly buttered individual tin mould, set mould in pan 
of hot water, cover with buttered paper, and bake in a 
moderate oven twelve minutes, or until firm. Remove 
from mould and pour around White Sauce. 

Chicken and Rice Cutlets. 

Follow recipe for Steamed Rice (see p. 104), using 
chicken stock in place of water. Half fill slightly but- 
tered cutlet moulds with rice, then fill with chicken force-

meat, using recipe for Chicken Timbale. Set in pan of 
hot water, cover with buttered paper, and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until chicken is firm. Remove from moulds 
and pour around White Sauce. 

Chicken Souffle^ 

Melt one teaspoon butter, add one teaspoon flour, and 
pour on, gradually, while stirring constantly, one-fourth 
cup milk; then add one tablespoon soft bread crumbs 
and one-eighth teaspoon salt and cook one minute. Re- 
move from fire and add one-fourth cup cold cooked 
chicken finely chopped, and cut and fold in one egg 
white beaten until stiff. Turn into slightly buttered tin 
mould, set in pan of hot water, cover with buttered paper, 
and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Remove from 
mould and pour around White Sauce. 

Broiled Quail on Toast. 

Singe, wipe, and with a sharp pointed knife, beginning 
at back of neck, make a cut through backbone the entire 
length of bird. Lay open bird and remove contents. 
Cut out ribs either side of backbone, remove breast- 
bone, and cross legs. Place on a greased broiler and 
broil eight to ten minutes over a clear fire. Arrange on 
buttered toast, spread with butter, sprinkle with salt, and 
garnish with toast points, cubes of jelly, parsley, and 
lemon. 

Boned Squab in Paper Case. 

Butter sparingly, using a butter brush, one-half sheet 
foolscap paper. Place a boned bird on lower half of 
sheet and fold upper part over bird, bringing edges 
together. Begin at edges and fold over lower side and 
ends of paper three times. Place in a wire broiler and 
broil ten minutes over a slow fire, turning often, being 
careful that paper does not catch on fire. Remove bird 
from case on to a slice of buttered toast, season with salt 



158 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

and pepper, spread with soft butter, and garnish with 
toast points, cubes of jelly, lemon, and parsley. 

A breast of chicken, tenderloin of steak, or lamb chop 
may be broiled in a paper case. 

How to bone a Bird. 

In buying birds for boning, select those which have 
been fresh killed, dry picked, and not drawn. Singe, re- 
move pin-feathers, head, and feet, and cut off wings close 
to body. Lay bird on a board, breast down. 

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the skin 
the entire length of body. Scrape the flesh from back- 
bone until end of one shoulder-blade is found; scrape 
flesh from shoulder-blade and continue around wing-joint, 
cutting through tendinous portions which are encountered ; 
then bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone the 
entire length of body, working across the ribs. Free 
wishbone and collar-bones, at same time removing crop 
and windpipe ; continue down breastbone, particular care 
being taken not to break the skin, as it lies very near bone, 
or to cut the delicate membranes which enclose entrails. 
Scrape flesh from second joints and drumsticks, laying it 
back and drawing off as a glove may be drawn from the 
hand. Withdraw carcass and put flesh back in its origi- 
nal shape. 

Broiled Tenderloin of Beef with Beef Marrow. 

Saw a marrow-bone into one and one-fourth inch pieces. 
Remove marrow and put in boiling salted water. Cook 
eight minutes, keeping water just below the boiling point.

O. Atwater. 



THE so-called vegetables, with the exception of peas, 
beans, and leutils, contain a small amount of 
nutriment, but are valuable, nevertheless, for the large 
amount of water and the mineral matter they contain. 
Vegetables are necessary for the body's needs, as they 
give bulk to the food and possess especial antiscorbutic 
properties. 

In selecting summer vegetables, choose those that are 
fresh and crisp, and when possible purchase from the pro- 
ducer, as they should be cooked as soon after gathering 
as possible. 

Beans and peas, when fresh, young, and tender, may 
be used to advantage in the sick-room. If served when 
old, they should be pressed through a strainer after beiDg 
li

cooked, and made into a pur£e or soup. In this way the 
cellulose may be discarded. 

Asparagus appears in the market as one of the early 
native vegetables, and may be introduced into the dietary 
of the convalescent. 

In the spring of the year many patients long for dande- 
lions. Their peculiar bitter flavor acts as a stimulant to 
a flagging appetite. A desire is often expressed for beet 
greens, which may be indulged. 

Cauliflower may be used by the convalescent, while 
cabbage, which belongs to the same family, should be 
avoided except by the people who serve it frequently 
when in health. During the cooking of cabbage certain 
ferments are developed which cause the vegetable when 
eaten to give rise to stomach eructations. 

Onions are wholesome and quite nutritious to persons 
with whom they agree. The Bermuda and Spanish onions 
are much more delicate in flavor than the common garden 
onion. Onions impart a strong odor to the breath, due 
to volatile substances absorbed by the blood, and by the 
blood carried to the lungs, where they are set free. 

The use of broiled or stewed tomatoes in many dis- 
eases is not objectionable ; however, in cases where citric 
acid is to be avoided, tomatoes must be excluded from 
the dietary. A reliable brand of canned tomatoes is quite 
as satisfactory as the fresh vegetable if the canned goods 
are thoroughly re-oxygenated. 

Spinach is found in the market throughout the year, 
but is especially desirable during the winter, when most 
of the green vegetables are expensive and of inferior 
quality. 

Among the summer vegetables, green corn and cucum- 
bers should be avoided, as they are the source of much 
stomach and bowel trouble. 

Unless one has access to the large city markets, the 
supply of vegetables during the winter months is limited 
to squash, turnips, carrots, parsnips, beets, cabbage, and 
onions. Squash is the only one among them all that

would not be subject to unfavorable criticism if used in 
the feeding of the sick, and even this vegetable must be 
excluded from the dietary of the diabetic. 

Lettuce is classed among salad greens. It may be 
obtained usually throughout the year, as it is raised 
during the winter in hothouses, at which time it is espe- 
cially palatable. It should be fresh and crisp. The outer 
leaves, which are usually somewhat wilted, should be dis- 
carded. The food value of lettuce is much increased 
when served with a French Dressing. Many a thin person 
would find a real fattening agent in olive oil. 

The young, tender stalks of celery often prove an 
appetizer, while radishes would better be avoided on 
account of the large amount of cellulose they contain. 

Among other salad greens may be named chickory, 
water-cress, romaine, and escarole, all of which may be oc- 
casionally introduced into the menu of the convalescent. 



Cooking of. 

Vegetables, like all starchy foods, should be cooked in 
freshly boiling water, salt often being added to give 
flavor. By the application of hot water the starch grains 
swell and burst, which gives the starch an opportunity to 
escape through the layers of cellulose. 

From this statement it may be seen that cookery plays 
a very important part towards the complete digestion of 
starchy foods. 

Vegetables contain such a small quantity of protein 
that the loss during cooking should be made as slight 
as possible. Like animal protein it is coagulated by 
heat. It is more soluble in cold water than animal 
protein. Thus if vegetables are allowed to soak in 
cold water for too long a time, there will be an appre- 
ciable loss in nutritive value, mineral matter as well as 
protein. 



164 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Digestibility. 

The digestibility of vegetables depends upon their 
bulk and the quantity of cellulose they contain. The 
cellulose encloses the starch grains, thus making it difficult 
for the gastric juices to penetrate to the chief constituent 
of most vegetable foods, — starch. 

Neither hot nor cold water has any material effect on 
cellulose, even in young, tender vegetables. It may 
be stated as a general rule that vegetable food is less 
completely digested and absorbed than animal food. 
There are, however, some striking exceptions to this 
rule, namely, macaroni and rice. 

Vegetables throw a large amount of mechanical work 
on the stomach. As the gastric ferments play no part in 
the digestion of starchy foods, and as the food must be 
reduced to such a consistency as to be able to be forced 
on into the small intestine, it would seem desirable 
to restrict this class of foods for those with enfeebled 
digestion. 

WAYS OP COOKING. 

Boiled Asparagus. 

Cut off lower parts of nine stalks asparagus at the 
point at which they will snap. Wash, remove scales, 
and tie together. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, 
time required being from twenty to thirty-five minutes. 
Tips should be kept out of water for the first ten minutes 
of the cooking. Drain, place on hot serving-dish, spread 
with one : half tablespoon butter, and sprinkle with salt. 

Asparagus on Toast. 

Serve Boiled Asparagus on buttered toast, moistened 
with some of the water in which asparagus was cooked. 

Asparagus with Milk Toast. 
Serve Boiled Asparagus on Milk Toast, pouring two 
tablespoons sauce over asparagus. 



VEGETABLES. 165 

Creamed Asparagus Tips. 
Wash asparagus stalks, remove scales, and cut in one- 
inch pieces. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, 
cooking tips a shorter time than stalks. Drain and add 
to White Sauce I. (see p. 149). 

String Beans. 

Remove strings from beans and snap or cut in one inch 
pieces. Wash in cold water and cook in boiling water 
until soft, the time required being from one to three 
hours. Drain and season with butter and salt. Never 
buy string beans unless they are fresh and will snap 
easily. Cook beans in as little water as possible. 

Shell Beans. 

Shell beans may be bought either in or out of the shell. 
Wash beans and cook in boiling water from one to one 
and one-half hours, adding salt the last half hour of cook- 
ing. Cook in sufficiently small quantity of water, that 
there may be none to drain off when beans are cooked. 
Season with butter and salt. 

Shell beans may be cooked some time before needed 
and reheated for serving, providing butter has not been 
added. 

Brussels Sprouts in White Sauce. 

Pick over two-thirds cup sprouts, remove wilted leaves, 
and soak in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook in boiling 
salted water twenty minutes, or until easily pierced with a 
skewer. Drain and add to White Sauce I. (see p. 149). 

Creamed Cauliflower. 

Remove leaves, cut off stalk, and soak a small cauli- 
flower thirty minutes, head down, in cold water to cover. 
Cook, head up, twenty minutes, or until soft, in boiling 
salted water. Drain, separate flowerets, and to two- 
thirds cup add White Sauce I. (see p. 149). 



166 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Celery. 

To prepare celery for table, cut off roots and leaves, 
separate stalks, wash, scrape, and chill in cold or ice 
water. By adding a slice of lemon to water, celery is 
kept white and made crisp. If one end of stalks is 
curled, celery looks more attractive for serving. 

Curled Celery. 

Cut thick stalk celery in two-inch pieces. With a 
sharp knife, beginning at outside of stalks, make five 
cuts parallel to each other extending one-third the length 
of pieces. Make six cuts at right angles to cuts already 
made. Put pieces in ice water and let stand for several 
hours, when celery will curl and be found crisp. 

Beet Greens. 

Wash thoroughly, scrape roots, and cut off ends. 
Drain and cook one hour, or until tender, in a small 
quantity of boiling salted water. Drain again and 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Dandelions. 

Wash thoroughly, remove roots, drain, and cook one 
hour, or until tender, in boiling salted water. Drain 
again, season with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve 
with vinegar. 

Lettuce. 

In buying lettuce select small, heavy heads with firm, 
light-colored centres. Remove leaves from stalk, dis- 
carding outer leaves. Wash in cold water, drain, and dry 
on towel, putting leaves so that water may drop from 
them. Keep in cold place until serviug time. 

French Dressing usually accompanies lettuce. 

Boiled Onions. 

Put onions in cold water and remove skins, using a 
vegetable knife, while under water. Put in saucepan, 



VEGETABLES. 167 

cover with boiling salted water, and boil five minutes ; 
drain, and again cover with boiling salted water. Cook 
one hour, or until soft but not broken. Drain again, add 
a small quantity of milk, cook five minutes, and season 
with butter and salt. 

Green Peas. 

Remove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one-half hour. Skim off undeveloped peas which 
rise to top and drain remaining peas. Cook until soft 
in a small quantity of boiling water. There should be 
but little if any water to drain from peas when they are 
cooked. If peas have lost much of their natural sweet- 
ness they are much improved by a small quantity of 
sugar. Season with butter and salt. 

Creamed Peas. 

Rinse thoroughly one-third cup canned peas, cover with 
boiling water, boil one minute, and again drain. Add to 
peas one-half tablespoon butter and cook four minutes. 
Dredge with oue teaspoon flour mixed with one-eighth 
teaspoon sugar. Add one tablespoon cream, and salt and 
pepper to taste. 

Croustades of Peas. 

Serve Creamed Peas in Croustades of Bread (see 
p. 99). 

Boiled Spinach. 

Remove roots, carefully pick over (discarding wilted 
leaves), and wash in several waters, to be sure that it is 
free from sand. If young and tender put in stew pan, 
heat gradually, and cook twenty-five minutes in its own 
juices. If old cook in boiling salted water, allowing one- 
fourth as much water as spinach. Drain, chop, reheat, 
and season with butter and salt. Garnish with slices of 
" hard boiled " egg. 

The green color of spinach is better retained by cooking 
in a large quantity of water in an uncovered vessel.

Wipe and cover with boiling water, let stand one min- 
ute, then remove skins. Chill thoroughly and cut in 
one-third inch slices. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Wipe, pare, cut in pieces, put in saucepan, and cook 
slowly twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Season 
with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Broiled Tomatoes. 

Wipe, cut in halves crosswise, and cut off a thin slice 
from rounding part of each half. Sprinkle with salt, dip 
in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again, place in a well-buttered 
broiler, and broil six to eight minutes. 

Baked Stuffed Tomatoes. 
Wipe and remove thin slice from stem end of two small 
tomatoes, take out seeds and pulp, sprinkle inside with 
salt, invert and let stand twenty minutes. To pulp add 
an equal quantity of soft stale bread crumbs, season 
with salt, pepper, and a few drops onion juice and refill 
tomatoes with mixture. Sprinkle with buttered crumbs 
and bake in a hot oven fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Baked Tomatoes Virginia Style. 

Wipe one medium-sized tomato. Put into a small 
casserole dish, sprinkle with salt, and bake until tomato 
is soft but does not lose its shape. Remove the skin and 
pour over White Sauce I (see p. 159) and serve at once. 



POTATOES. 169 



CHAPTER XXI. 
POTATOES. 

COMPOSITION. 

Water, 78.9%. Proteid, 2.1%. 

Starch, 18%. Mineral matter, .9%. 

Fat, .1%. 

OOTATOES are tubers of the plant Solarium tuberosum. 
-*• It may be seen from studying their composition that 
their food value lies, principally, in the starch which they 
contain. Being deficient in proteid and fat, they should 
be used in combination with such foods as eggs, meat, 
or fish. 

Seldom a day passes that potatoes do not appear on the 
menu of one or more meals, which proves them to be a 
popular, inexpensive food. If properly cooked they are 
more easily digested than most of the vegetable foods, as 
they contain but a comparatively small quantity of cellu- 
lose. Their digestibility is increased by being mashed. 
If they are allowed to enter the stomach in large pieces, 
as is sometimes the case when boiled potatoes are served, 
they are liable to cause gastric disturbance. 

The method preferred for cooking potatoes when to be 
served to a young child or convalescent, is baking, in a 
hot oven, which changes some of the starch to dextrine, 
thus increasing its digestibility. If baked in an oven at 
a low temperature, they have no advantage over boiled 
or steamed potatoes. Potatoes should be served at once 
after cooking. Warmed-over potatoes, while very palat- 
able to those in health, should be avoided in the dietary 
of the sick. 

Potatoes contain an acrid principle, the greater part of 
which lies near the skin. For this reason potatoes are 



170 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

usually pared when prepared for boiling. It must be 
remembered, however, that there is a greater nutritive 
loss than when cooked with the jackets on. This loss 
consists largely of the mineral constituent, which may be 
well supplied by green vegetables. 

When new potatoes first appear in the market they are 
not a desirable food for the sick-room, as the starch is 
not thoroughly matured. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a 
vegetable brush, and place on a tin plate. Bake in hot 
oven forty minutes, or until soft. Remove from oven, 
press between the fingers, and rupture skin. Take from 
skin, and serve at once with butter and salt, or cream 
and salt. If allowed to stand they soon become soggy, 
as the starch reabsorbs moisture. 

Potato a la Suzette. 

Wash a smooth, round, medium-sized potato, and bake 
in a hot oven until soft. Cut a slice from top and 
scoop out most of the inside. Force through a potato 
ricer, season with butter, salt, and pepper and add a small 
quantity of milk. Break an egg into a cup and slip into 
potato case. Force potato mixture through a pastry bag 
and tube around edge. Return to oven and bake until 
egg is set. Arrange on serving dish and garnish with 
water-cress. 

Potatoes served in Shell. 

Bake two potatoes. Cut a small piece from top of 
each, and scoop out inside. Mash, add one-half table- 
spoon butter, salt, pepper, and one tablespoon hot milk ; 
then add white one-half egg beaten stiff. Refill shells, 
and bake five minutes in a very hot oven. 

Boiled Potatoes. 

2 medium-sized potatoes. Boiling water. 

i^ tablespoon salt.

POTATOES. 171 

Wash and pare potatoes. Drop at once into cold water 
to prevent discoloration. Let stand thirty minutes or 
longer. In the spring several hours will do no harm, as 
the starch in the potato has become to some extent 
changed to dextrin, which gives a sweet taste. By long 
soaking the potato upon cooking becomes more mealy. 

Drain, cook in a small saucepan of boiling salted 
water, being sure water covers potatoes, until soft, which 
may be easily determined by piercing with a skewer or 
fork. Pour off water and let potatoes stand in warm 
place that steam may escape. Avoid serving in covered 
dish, as condensed steam causes the potato to become 
soggy. 

Steamed Potatoes. 

Prepare potatoes as for Boiled Potatoes. Put in small 
strainer, place over kettle of boiling water, cover tightly, 
and cook until soft. 



Riced Potatoes. 

Sprinkle hot Boiled or Steamed Potatoes sparingly 
with salt, and force through a potato ricer. Pile lightly 
on serving-dish in form of pyramid. 

Mashed Potatoes. 310 Calories. 

To hot Riced Potatoes add one tablespoon butter, hot 
milk to moisten, and salt to taste. Beat until creamy, 
using a silver-plated fork. Pile lightly on serving-dish, 
leaving a rough surface. By smoothing the surface, potato 
is made compact, and is liable to be soggy. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

Wash, pare, and soak potatoes. Cut in one-third inch 
cubes (there should be one-half cup), and cook in boiling 
water to cover, to which has been added one teaspoon 



172 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

salt, until soft. Drain, add one-third cup White Sauce, 
stir lightly with fork to mix potatoes with sauce, and 
sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. 



Duchess Potato. 

Prepare Mashed Potatoes, add yolk one egg, and force 
through a pastry bag and tube. Serve as a garnish to 
Broiled Fish. 

Potato Border. 

Place a buttered egg cup on small saucer, build around 
it a wall of hot Mashed Potatoes, and garnish with potato 
forced through a pastry bag and tube. Remove cup, fill 
potato border with creamed fish or chicken, and garnish 
with parsley. 

Potatoes au Gratin. 

Prepare Creamed Potatoes, put in buttered baking 
dish, cover with buttered crumbs, and bake until crumbs 
are brown. Allow one tablespoon melted butter to one- 
fourth cup cracker crumbs, and stir with fork until well 
mixed. 

Potato Balls I. 

Wash and pare large smooth potatoes. Shape in balls, 
using a French vegetable cutter. Soak in cold water and 
cook in boiling, salted water until soft. Drain, and serve 
with White Sauce. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. 

Potato BaUs II. 

Prepare same as Potato Balls I., allowing one-half cup, 
and serve with 

Maitre d'Hotel Butter. Cream one tablespoon but- 
ter, add gradually one-third teaspoon lemon juice, one- 
eighth teaspoon salt, a few grains pepper, and one-half 
teaspoon finely chopped parsley. 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 173 



CHAPTER XXII. 
SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 

SALADS are compounds of cold cooked meat, fish, eggs, 
cheese, vegetables, or fruits with a salad green (let- 
tuce, chickory, escarole, romaine, water-cress, cucumbers, 
celery, or radishes) and a dressing. They find no place 
in cookery for the sick except during the advanced stages 
of convalescence, in chronic and wasting diseases, or after 
a surgical operatiou. 

Salad greens have but little food value, but are useful 
for the water and potash salts they contain, besides being 
cooling, refreshing, and stimulating to the appetite. In 
selecting salad greens choose only those that are fresh 
and crisp, and see to it that they are thoroughly washed 
and drained before serving. French dressing greatly in- 
creases their nutritive value, and pure olive oil is most 
beneficial to the system. Cream and Mayonnaise dress- 
ings, although highly nutritious, are so complex as to 
render them difficult of digestion. 

Salads are not acceptable unless served cold, and for 
this reason, especially as they are taken near the close 
of the meal, they are apt to retard digestion. 

Dietitians in hospitals are constantly receiving calls 
from private wards for salads, and for this reason a few 
simple salad recipes are introduced. If other combina- 
tions are used, avoid vegetables which contain a large 
quantity of cellulose or many seeds. A lettuce salad 
served with French dressing is usually the most accept- 
able one to offer with a dinner. Meat, fish, egg, and 
cheese salads should furnish the chief dish of a meal, 
therefore are adapted for luncheon or supper. 



174 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



SALAD DRESSINGS. 

Boiled Dressing. 

% teaspoon salt. Yolk 1 egg. 

% teaspoon mustard. 1 tablespoon melted butter. 

Few grains cayenne. )/ % cup cream. 

1 tablespoon vinegar. 

Mix ingredients in order given, adding vinegar very 
slowly. Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly, 
until mixture thickens ; strain and cool. 



Cream Dressing I. 

% teaspoon mustard. 1 teaspoon melted butter. 

% teaspoon salt. Yolks 2 eggs. 

Few grains cayenne. 2 tablespoons hot vinegar. 

% cup heavy cream. 

Mix dry ingredients, and add butter, egg, and vinegar. 
Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly until mixture 
thickens ; cool, and add to heavy cream, beaten stiff. 

Cream Dressing II. 

3 tablespoons heavy cream. % teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon vinegar. Few grains pepper. 

Beat cream until stiff, using smallest size Dover Egg 
Beater. Add seasonings and vinegar very slowly, con- 
tinuing the beating. 

French Dressing. 

% tablespoon vinegar. % teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon olive oil. Few grains pepper. 

Mix ingredients and stir, using a silver fork, until well 
blended. French dressing should always be added to 
salad greens just before serving. If allowed to stand 
in dressing they will quickly wilt. 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 175 

Mayonnaise Dressing. 

^ teaspoon mustard. Yolk % egg. 

% teaspoon salt. % tablespoon lemon juice. 

14 teaspoon powdered sugar. % tablespoon vinegar. 

Few grains cayenne. % cup olive oil. 

Mix dry ingredients, add egg yolk, stir until well 
mixed, and add a few drops vinegar ; then add oil grad- 
ually at first, drop by drop, and stir constantly. As 
mixture thickens, thin with vinegar until that is used, 
then use lemon juice. Add oil alternately with vinegar 
or lemon juice until all is used, stirring or beating con- 
stantly. After the mixture is well thickened the oil may 
be added in a slow, steady stream, while the beating is 
continued vigorously. Oil for the making of Mayonnaise 
should be thoroughly chilled, and egg should be fresh 
and have been kept in ice box or cold place. 

It is desirable, although not absolutely necessary, for 
bowl containing mixture to be placed in a larger bowl 
of ice water. 

A silver fork, wire whisk, small wooden spoon, or 
Dover Egg Beater may be used as preferred. 

The making of Mayonnaise often troubles the inex- 
perienced cook, while in reality, if the egg is fresh and 
cold, the oil thoroughly chilled, and the work done 
quickly and deftly, the process is a very simple one. 

During the making of Mayonnaise if the conditions are 
not right the mixture often becomes curdled. The same 
thing may take place if too long a time is taken in its 
preparation. Should it become curdled, a smooth con- 
sistency may be restored by taking remaining half of egg 
yolk and adding mixture slowly to it, beating constantly. 
A Mayonnaise when done should be stiff enough to hold 

its shape. 

Oil Dressing. 

Yolks 2 "hard-boiled" eggs. % teaspoon mustard. 
1 tablespoon olive oil. % teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon vinegar. Few grains cayenne. 

Rub yolks of eggs until smooth, add seasonings, then 
gradually oil aud vinegar. 



176 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

SALADS. 
Dressed Lettuce. 

Remove leaves from stalk, discarding outside wilted 
ones. Wash each leaf separately in cold water and 
shake, holding between thumb and forefinger, that 
leaves may not be broken. Arrange leaves on a towel 
in such a way that the water that remains may drop 
from them. Serve with Boiled or French Dressing. 

If the outside leaves are tender, the edges may be 
trimmed with the scissors, then leaves cut in shreds. 
Lettuce may be washed, arranged in its original shape, 
and kept in a covered lard pail in a cool place until 
needed. 

Egg Salad I. 

Cut one "hard-boiled" egg in halves crosswise in 
such a way that tops of halves are left in small points. 
To accomplish this a small sharp-pointed vegetable knife 
is necessary. Remove yolk, rub through a sieve, moisten 
with Boiled Dressing, and refill whites with mixture. Ar- 
range on lettuce leaves, garnish with thin slices of radish 
overlapping each other and a radish cut to represent a 
tulip or chrysanthemum. 

How to cut Radishes to represent Tulips. Select 
smooth, firm red radishes of the round variety. Remove 
leaves, leaving stems one inch long: beginning at root 
ends, make seven incisions at equal distances through 
skin extending nearly to stem ends. Pass knife under 
sections of skin and cut as far as incisions extend, then 
make several cuts through fleshy portion. Place in cold 
water and let stand one hour, when sections of skin will 
fold back and centres will open. 

How to cut Radishes to represent Chrysanthe- 
mums. Select round radishes, and cut off a thin slice 
from the root ends. Scrape radishes in several places 
to remove some of the red color. Cut from top nearly 
to stem end in thin parallel slices, then cut thin slices 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 177 

at right angles to slices already cut. Let stand in cold 
water one hour or more, when radishes will open to look 
like a flower. 

Egg Salad II. 

Separate yolk from white of one "hard-boiled" egg. 
Finely chop white, moisten with French Dressing, arrange 
on a lettuce leaf in the form of a circle, and pile yolk, 
forced through a strainer, in the centre. 

Cheese Salad. 

Mash Neufchatel cheese and shape in form of robiu's 
eggs. Roll in parsley that has been dried in cheese cloth, 
then very finely chopped. Arrange three eggs on lettuce 
leaves and serve with French Dressing. 

If the cheese crumbles and cannot be readily shaped, 
moisten with cream. 

Tomato Salad I. 

Peel, chill a tomato, and cut in thirds crosswise. Ar* 
range on lettuce leaves and serve with French or May- 
onnaise Dressing. 

Tomato Salad II. 

Peel a medium-sized tomato, cut a thin slice from stem 
end, and remove seeds and some of the pulp. Sprinkla 
inside with salt, invert, and let stand one-half hour. Fill 
with sweetbread cut in small cubes, mixed with an equal 
quantity of cold cooked peas and one-half the quantity 
of finely cut celery moistened with dressing. Arrange on 
lettuce leaves for serving. 

Tomato Basket 'with Peas. 

Select a small, shapely, bright red tomato, with a 
piece of the stem left on. Cut in shape of basket, and 
scoop out pulp and seeds, using a spoon or French vege- 
table cutter. Refill basket with cold cooked peas mois- 
tened with French Dressing and mixed with two halves 
of walnut meats broken in pieces.

178 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Chicken Salad. 

Cut cold boiled fowl or roast chicken in one-half inch 
cubes. Wash, scrape, and cut celery in small pieces. 
Put in bowl of cold or ice water that it may become 
crisp, then drain and dry on a towel. Just before serving 
add to chicken, using one-half as much celery as chicken. 

Mound on a lettuce leaf, mask with dressing, and gar- 
nish with white of egg cut in fancy shapes, yolk of egg 
forced through a strainer, and capers ; or omit lettuce and 
surround with curled celery. 

Sweetbread and Celery Salad. 

Prepare same as Chicken Salad, substituting sweetbread 
in place of chicken. 

A sweetbread and celery salad is attractively served in 
a ripe red apple prepared by removing a slice from stem 
end, scooping out all pulp that is possible, leaving just 
enough that apple may retain its shape. 

SANDWICHES. 

The first requisite in the preparation of sandwiches is 
bread of close, even texture from twenty-four to thirty- 
six hours old. White, entire wheat, Graham, or brown 
bread may be used ; also Zwieback and some varieties 
of thin unsweetened crackers. Patients are tempted 
often to eat bread and butter when served in the form 
of a sandwich, when they would refuse the slice of 
bread accompanied by the butter ball. The shape, too, 
often makes a difference. A heart-shaped sandwich 
often pleases an adult as well as a child. Men and 
women are certainly but children of an older growth, 
which fact is especially emphasized during times of 
sickness and suffering. 

Bread for sandwiches should be cut as thin as possi- 
ble, and all crusts should be removed. In order to accom- 
plish this a sharp, thin-bladed knife is an essential. 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 179 

If butter is used it should be creamed (using a wooden 
spoon or silver fork) and spread on the loaf before the 
slices are cut, unless the sandwiches are to be formed in 
round or fancy shapes, when there would be a loss of 
butter. 

After bread is sliced spread one-half the pieces with 
filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cut in shapes. 
If bread is first cut in shapes, then one-half the pieces 
spread with mixture, the mixture either does not come 
to edges or extends over them, thus detracting from the 
appearance of the finished sandwich. 

If sandwiches are prepared before serving time they 
may be kept fresh and moist by wrapping in paraffine 
paper or a napkin wrung as dry as possible out of hot 
water. 

Sandwiches should be served on a plate covered with 
a doily. 

Bread and Butter Sandwiches. 

Remove end slice from loaf of bread, and spread end 
of loaf evenly with butter which has been creamed. 

Cut off as thin a slice as possible, taking care that it 
is of uniform thickness. Repeat until the required num- 
ber of slices are prepared. Put together in pairs, re- 
move crusts, and cut in squares, oblongs, or triangles. 

Entire Wheat Sandwiches. 

Prepare same as Bread and Butter Sandwiches, using 
Entire Wheat Bread. 

Raw Beef Sandwiches. 

Scrape beef, cut from round, same as for Beef Balls 
(see p. 141). Prepare bread as for Bread and Butter 
Sandwiches. Spread one-half the pieces with scraped 
beef seasoned with salt; if pepper is desired, use spar- 
ingly. Cover with remaining pieces, then cut in finger- 
shaped pieces or triangles. 



180 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Toasted Beef Sandwiches. 



Place Raw Beef Sandwiches in a fine wire toaster and 
place over clear coals or under a gas flame. Brown deli- 
cately on one side, turn and brown other side. 

Egg Sandwiches I. 

Prepare two slices of bread as for Bread and Butter 
Sandwiches. Mash yolk of "hard-boiled" egg, using a 
silver fork, or rub through a sieve. Season with salt and 
moisten with melted butter or cream, until of the right 
consistency to spread. Spread on one piece, cover with 
remaining piece, then cut as desired. 

Egg Sandwiches II. 

Finely chop white of ' ' hard-boiled " egg and mix with 
yolk rubbed through a sieve. Moisten with Boiled Dress- 
ing (see p. 164) and spread between pieces of bread pre- 
pared as for Bread and Butter Sandwiches. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. 

Put fresh, crisp lettuce leaves, washed and thoroughly 
dried, between thin slices of bread prepared as for Bread 
and Butter Sandwiches, having a teaspoon of Cream or 
Mayonnaise Dressing (see pp. 164, 165) on each leaf. The 
slices of bread must be put together in pairs, cut in shapes, 
and then separated to insert the lettuce leaf, which should 
extend over the edge of bread. 



Chicken Sandwiches. 

Cut very thin slices from the breast of a cold roast 
chicken or boiled fowl. Put on slices of buttered bread, 
sprinkle with salt, cover with slices of buttered bread, and 
cut as desired. 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 181 

Chopped Chicken Sandwiches. 

Chop remnants of cold boiled fowl, moisten with rich 
chicken stock, and season with salt, pepper, and celery 
salt. Make same as other sandwiches. 

Fig Sandwiches. 

Remove stems from figs and chop finely, or force 
through a meat chopper. Put in double boiler, add a 
small quantity of water, and cook one hour. Season with 
lemon juice, cool, and spread between slices of buttered 
bread. 

Jelly Sandwiches. 

Spread Zephyrettes with quince or apple jelly, sprinkle 
with finely chopped English walnut meat, then cover with 
Zephyrettes. 

Sweet Sandwiches. 

Cut Zwieback (see p. 97), in thin slices, spread with 
orange or quince marmalade, cover with thin slices of 
Zwieback, and remove crusts.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

FROZEN DESSERTS. 

"PROZEN desserts, whether in the form of ices or 
■*■ creams, are of inestimable value in the sick-room, 
if given at the proper time and under favorable con- 
ditions. They had better be served with a simple meal 
or between meals, for if introduced as the last course of 
a dinner they are apt to reduce the temperature of the 
stomach contents and thus for a time retard digestion. 
However, if eaten slowly, as they always should be, the 
effect upon digestion is slighter than is usually supposed. 

If eggs and cream enter into their composition, es- 
pecially if the cream be of good quality, they have a high 
food value. Patients, especially children, with but little 
appetite are often tempted by ice cream, and it is fre- 
quently ordered by physicians, as they realize the neces- 
sity of sufficient nourishment and know the value of the 
dish they are recommending. 

When ice cream is home-made, care must be taken that 
it is not too rich nor too sweet ; there is seldom danger of 
these errors in the caterer's products. 

For the individual recipes of ices and ice creams an ice 
cream freezer of ordinary capacity proves impracticable. 
A baby ice cream freezer is on the market which answers 
the purpose, but as these are owned by but a few, a 
freezer may be improvised which does the work to the 
satisfaction of the nurse. A five-pound lard pail, one- 
pound baking powder can, silver-plated knife and spoon, 
complete the outfit. If the mixture to be frozen is a 
water ice, containing fruit juices, a jelly tumbler with 
fitted cover is substituted for the baking powder can, as 



FROZEN DESSERTS. 207 

the action of the acid on the tin is liable to produce a 
poisonous compound. 

Chemistry of freezing Ices and Creams. , 

Ice and rock or coarse fine salt are used for freezing 
ices and creams. Salt has a great affinity for water, 
causing the ice to melt rapidly, thus withdrawing heat 
from the contents of the can, which causes the mixture to 
freeze. The principle of latent heat is here demonstrated. 
In the one case the ice, a solid, is changed to a liquid ; 
in the other case the liquid mixture is changed to a solid. 

How to freeze Ices and Creams. 

Finely crushed ice and rock or coarse fine salt are 
necessary for the freezing of ices and creams. They are 
used in the proportion of three parts ice to one part salt. 
These proportions are satisfactory for the production of a 
smooth, fine-grained cream. 

If more salt is employed the cream is coarser and less 
smooth in texture ; where less salt is used more time is 
required for the freezing, with no better results. When 
water ices are to be frozen, one-half salt and one-half ice 
is employed, if a granular consistency is desired, as is the 
case in frappes or granites. 

Cover bottom of pail with crushed ice, put in baking 
powder box or tumbler containing mixture to be frozen, 
and surround with ice and salt in correct proportions, 
adding ice and salt alternately, until the pail is two- 
thirds full. 

Turn box or tumbler with hand, and as soon as mixture 
begins to freeze scrape frozen portion from sides of box 
or tumbler and beat mixture with a spoon, so continuing 
until the entire mixture is frozen. 

If the baby ice cream freezer is used, fill tub with ice 
and salt in correct proportions, turn crank slowly at first, 
that the contents nearest the can may be acted upon by 
the salt and ice. After the mixture is frozen to the con- 



208 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

sistency of a mush, then the crank may be turned more 
rapidly. Do not draw off the water until the freezing is 
accomplished, unless there is a possibility of the salt water 
getting into the can. 

An ice shaver or a small burlap bag and wooden mallet 
are the best utensils for crushing ice. 

Lemon Ice. 

^ cup sugar. % CU P boiling water. 

2 tablespoons lemon juice. 

Make a syrup by boiling sugar and water five minutes. 
Cool, add lemon juice, strain, and freeze, using three 
parts finely crushed ice to one part rock salt. Serve in 
frappe or champagne glass. 

Orange Ice. 

% cup sugar. Y % cup orange juice. 

y% cup boiling water. % tablespoon lemon juice. 

Make syrup by boiling sugar and water five minutes. 
Cool, add fruit juices, strain, and freeze. To obtain 
orange juice, cut orange in halves crosswise, remove pulp 
and juice, using a spoon, then strain through cheese cloth. 
A glass lemon squeezer may be used if care is taken not 
to break the peel. Take out all tough portions and re- 
maining pulp from peel and point tops, using sharp 
scissors. Fill cups thus made with ice for serving. 

Grape Fruit Ice.

freeze. Raspberry ice made in this way is of a much 
brighter color than when the fruit juice is added to a 

syrup. 

Strawberry Ice. 

Make same as Raspberry Ice, using strawberries in 
place of raspberries. The quantity of sugar must depend 
somewhat on the acidity of the fruit.

FRUITS are, usually, at their best when served fresh, 
ripe, and in season, and there are but few with whom 
they do not agree. Those who cannot take them in the 
raw state often find them acceptable when cooked. 

Fresh fruits have but little food value, but their use in 
dietaries is of great importance nevertheless, on account 
of the mineral constituents which they contain. These 
constituents are made of potash combined with various 
vegetable acids, namely, tartaric, citric, malic, oxalic, etc., 
which render the blood more alkaline and the urine less 
acid. The antiscorbutic value of fruits is due to these 



214 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

constituents. A case of scurvy is quickly acted upon by 
the use of fresh fruits. 

The nutritive value of fruits is chiefly in the form of 
fruit sugar (levulose), although some fruits contain cane 
sugar (sucrose) as well as fruit sugar. Examples : apples, 
apricots, pineapples, etc. The carbohydrate of fruit con- 
tains, besides sugar, vegetable gums, which when boiled 
yield a jelly-like substance. Exception must be made 
to bananas, which contain their carbohydrate largely in the 
form of starch. Dried fruits have much greater nutritive 
value than fresh fruits. Weight for weight, dried figs are 
more nourishing than bread. 

The flavor of fruits, although of no nutritive value, helps 
to make them useful as foods, as they act as stimulants 
to the appetite and aids to digestion. 

In selecting fresh fruit choose that which is sound, 
firm, and not over-ripe. Fruit which has began to de- 
compose contains micro-organisms, which are likely to 
cause many ills. Bruised, imperfect fruit, even if bought 
at a small price, proves no economy. 

Cooking of. 

The flavor of fruits is impaired by cooking, but when 
they contain a large proportion of cellulose their digesti- 
bility is increased. 

Cooking fruits also converts their gums into a gelati- 
nous form, which change is demonstrated in the making 
of jellies. 

Unripe fruits, which ought never to be allowed in the 
raw state, are rendered fit for consumption by cooking. 

Digestibility. 

The digestibility of fruits depends largely upon the 
quantity of cellulose they contain, their number of seeds, 
and their ripeness ; also the fineness of their division 
when reaching the stomach. 

Peach pulp forced through a sieve or scraped apple 
pulp is often easily digested, when, if eaten in the usual 



FRUITS AND HOW TO SERVE THEM. 



215 



way and imperfectly masticated, would prove a stomach 
irritant. When unripe fruits are eaten their excess of 
acids causes pain, colic, diarrhoea, and nausea. During 
the ripening of fruits their sugar increases, while their 
acids decrease. Ripe fruits act as a mild stimulant to 
digestion. 

Baked Apples. 

Wipe, core, and pare sour apples. Put in an earthen 
or granite ware baking-dish, fill cavities with sugar, and 
allow six drops lemon juice to each apple, then cover 
bottom of dish with boiling water. Bake in a hot oven 
until soft, basting every eight minutes with syrup in dish. 
Care must be taken that apples do not lose their shape. 
In tbe spring of the year when apples are somewhat flat 
and insipid to the taste, a few gratings nutmeg, which 
should be mixed with the sugar, are a great improvement 
to baked apples. Serve hot or cold, with or without 
sugar and cream. 

Belmont Baked Apples. 

Wipe selected red apples and make two circular cuts 
through skin, leaving a three-fourths-inch band around 
apple midway between stem and blossom ends. Put in an 
earthern or graniteware baking dish, sprinkle generously 
with sugar, and add water to cover bottom of pan. Bake 
in a hot oven until soft, basting every eight minutes with 
syrup in pan. Remove to serving dish and pour around 
syrup. 

Apple Sauce. 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare two apples. Make a 
syrup by boiling one-third cup, each, water and sugar, 
and a few grains salt, six minutes. Add apple to cover 
bottom of saucepan, and cook until soft, watching care- 
fully that sections of apple do not lose their shape. Re- 
move from syrup, then cook remaining pieces. Strain 
syrup remaining in pan over apples. 



216 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

Strained Apple Sauce. 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare one and one-half apples. 
Put in saucepan, sprinkle with sugar, add a few grains 
salt, and enough water to prevent apples from burning. 
Cook slowly until apples are soft, then rub through a 
sieve. 

The quantity of sugar and water used must depend on 
the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit. 

Baked Apple Sauce. 

1>£ apples (pared, cored, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. 

cut in eighths). 1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

1 tablespoon water. 

Put alternate layers of apple, sugar, and seasonings in 
a small earthen baking-dish; cover, and bake in a slow 
oven for one hour. A few gratings nutmeg may be used 
if desired. Serve hot or cold. 

Apples in Bloom. 

Select a medium-sized bright red apple. Wipe, and 
put in small saucepan. Add two-thirds cup boiling water 
and cook slowly until apple is soft, turning frequently. 
Take from saucepan, and remove skin carefully, using a 
silver knife. Scrape off all pulp that adheres to skin and 
replace on apple, that the red color may not be lost. To 
water in saucepan add one and one-half tablespoons 
sugar, few gratings lemon rind, and three-fourths table- 
spoon orange juice. Let simmer until syrup is reduced 
to two tablespoons, then strain over apple. Chill, and 
serve with whipped cream. 

Apple Snow. 

Wipe, pare, core, and quarter one sour apple. Put in 
soiall strainer, place over boiling water, cover, and let 
steam until apple is soft, then rub through a sieve ; there 
should be one-fourth cup apple pulp. Beat white of one 



FRUITS AND HOW TO SERVE THEM. 217 

egg until stiff, using a silver fork. Sweeten apple pulp 
to taste and add gradually to beaten white of egg, con- 
tinuing the beating. Pile lightly on glass serving-dish, 
chill, and serve with cream or Steamed Custard. 

Dried Apricot Sauce. 
Pick over and wash one-third cup dried apricots, cover 
with water, and let soak several hours. Cook slowly in 
same water until soft, adding more water if necessary. 
Sweeten to taste, and add a few grains salt. 

Strained Apricot Sauce. 
Make same as Dried Apricot Sauce, force through a 
strainer, and add orange juice to taste. 

How to serve a Banana. 

Remove skin from a thoroughly ripe banana, and scrape 
to remove the astringent principle which lies close to skin. 
Cut in thin slices, arrange on a serving-dish, sprinkle with 
sugar and a few drops lemon juice. 

Banana is served frequently with sugar and cream, but 
proves difficult of digestion to most people in health; 
therefore its use would better be avoided for the sick. 

Baked Banana. 
Wipe banana and loosen one section of skin, then re- 
place. Put in shallow pan, cover, and bake until skin is 
very dark, when banana should be soft. Remove from 
skin, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve at once. 

Cranberry Sauce. 
Pick over and wash one cup cranberries. Put in sauce- 
pan, add one-third cup sugar, and one-third cup water, 
bring to boiling point, and let boil five minutes. Remove 
from fire, force through a strainer, and cool. 

Cranberry Jelly. 
Pick over and wash one cup cranberries. Put in sauce- 
pan, add one-half cup sugar and one-fourth cup water, 



218 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

bring to boiling point and let boil five minutes. Kemove 
from fire, force through a strainer, and pour into individual 
glass or china moulds. Turn from moulds for serving. 

Stewed Figs. 

y z cup finely chopped figs. % tablespoon sugar. 

% cup water. 1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

Few grains salt. 

Cook figs, sugar, and water two hours in top of double 
boiler. Add lemon juice and salt. Chill before serving. 
One-half tablespoon sherry wine may be added if desired. 

How to serve Grapes. 

Put a bunch in colandar and pour over cold water, 
drain, chill, and arrange on serving-dish. Imperfect 
grapes, as well as those under ripe or over ripe, should be 
removed. 

A patient should never be allowed to eat grape skins, 
and in many cases it is desirable to remove grape seeds. 

How to serve Grape Fruit. 

"Wipe grape fruit and cut in halves crosswise. With a 
small sharp pointed knife make a cut separating pulp from 
skin around entire circumference ; then make cuts separ- 
ating pulp from tough portion which divides fruit into 
sections. Remove tough portion in one piece, which may 
be accomplished by one cutting with scissors at stem or 
blossom end close to skin. Sprinkle fruit pulp left in 
grape fruit skin generously with sugar. Let stand ten 
minutes, and serve. Place on fruit plate and garnish with 
a candied cherry. 

Ways of serving Oranges. 

1. Wipe orange and cut in halves crosswise. Place one- 
half on a fruit plate, having an orange spoon or teaspoon 
on plate at right of fruit. 

2. Wipe and cut orange in halves crosswise. Remove

pulp and juice, using a spoon. Sprinkle with sugar and 
serve in a glass dish. Should the orange be allowed to 
stand for any length of time after the sugar is added, a 
bitter flavor will be developed. 

3. Peel an orange and remove as much of the white 
portion as possible. Remove pulp by sections, which 
may be accomplished by using a sharp knife and cutting 
pulp from tough portion first on one side of section, then 
on other. Should there be any white portion of skin re- 
maining on pulp it should be cut off. Arrange sections 
on glass dish or fruit plate. If the orange is a seeded 
one, remove seeds. 

4. Remove peel from an orange in such a way that 
there remains a one-half inch band of peel equal distance 
from stem and blossom end. Cut band, separate sections, 
and arrange around a mound of sugar. 

Stewed Prunes. 

% cup prunes. 1% tablespoons sugar. 

1 cup cold water. Few grains salt. 

Wash and pick over prunes. Put in saucepan, add 
water, and soak two hours ; then cook slowly until soft in 
same water. When nearly cooked add sugar and salt. 
If soft selected prunes are used, the soaking will not be 
necessary. 

Baked Pears. 

Wipe, quarter, and core pears. Put in earthenware 
baking-dish, sprinkle with sugar, or add a small quantity 
of molasses, then add enough water that pears will not 
burn. Cover, and cook two or three hours in a very slow 
oven. Seckel pears baked whole are delicious.

bring to boiling point, and let boil two hours. Add 
sugar and let boil one hour. Turn into sterilized jelly 
tumblers and cover each glass with a circular piece of 
paraffine paper, then with a larger circular piece of letter 
paper, fastening paper securely over edge of glass with 
mucilage. 

Strawberries. 

Select one dozen ripe strawberries from which hulls 
have not been removed. Place in colander, pour over one 
eup celd water, or, if time allows, dip each one separately 
in cold water and drain. Arrange around a small mound 
of powdered sugar. When strawber*ies are to be served 
with hulls removed, wash before hulling. 

Peach Snow. 

Wipe and remove skin from one peach. Force pulp 
through a sieve, and if there is much juice, drain. Beat 
the white of one egg until stiff, using a silver fork. Add 
peach pulp gradually, while continuing the beating. 
Sweeten with powdered sugar, pile on glass dish, and 
serve with Steamed Custard or cream. 

Orange Mint Cup. 

Remove pulp from a sour orange. Sprinkle with three- 
fourths tablespoon powdered sugar, and add one-half 
tablespoon finely chopped mint, and one teaspoon, each, 
lemon juice and Sherry. Chill thoroughly. Turn into

cake pan. The cake should begin to rise during the first 
ten minutes, continue rising, and begin to brown during 
the second ten minutes ; continue browning during the 
next ten minutes, and in the last ten minutes finish baking 
and shrink from the pan. The success of a sponge cake 
depends upon the amount of air beaten into the eggs and 
the expansion of that air during baking. A slow oven 
is necessary for the baking of a genuine sponge cake. So- 
called sponge cake recipes which call for baking powder 
require a moderate oven.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
DIABETES. 1 

DIABETES means grape sugar in the urine on an 
ordinary diet. In the first stage of the disease 
starch turns to sugar ; in the second, albumen ; and in 
the third, fat. 

Diabetes is essentially a dietetic disease quite common 
and on the increase during the last forty years. It is a 
disease which has to be searched for, and a urine test is 
the only sure way by which it is diagnosed. No drug or 
medicinal remedy has yet been found which is a cura- 
tive, but prescribed diet keeps the disease under control, 
and unless the case is severe and of long standing sugar 
may entirely disappear from the urine. It might seem 
from this statement that diabetic cures have been accom- 
plished, though such is the case only with the rarest 
exceptious. 

When the disease develops in childhood it is usually 
severe, but little can be done, and the patient lives but 
a few weeks or months. There is a case reported by 
Naunyn in his work on Diabetes mellitus, however, which 
is an exception to this rule. When the disease develops in 
adults it is less severe, and life may be prolonged and 
made pleasurable for many years while of a mild type ; 
when it appears in advanced life it is dangerous on ac- 
count of complications. 

i A Diabetic Chart by Elliott P. Joslin, M. D., and Harry W. 
Goodall, M. D., Boston, Mass. (reprinted from the Boston Medical and 
Surgical Journal, Vol. clviii, No. 8, pp. 248-251. Feb. 20, 1908) 
D. C. Heath & Co., 120 Boylston St., Boston, Mass. 



DIABETES. 229 

The average daily diet for a diabetic patient, sugar free, 
has been estimated to include : 

Protein 75 grams x 4 = 300 calories. 

Carbohydrate 100 " x 4 = 400 " 

Fat 200 " x 9 = 1800 " 

Total caloric value 2500 

It may be seen from the above table that it is necessary 
to eliminate the carbohydrates as far as possible, to reduce 
the proteins and greatly to increase the fats in dietetic 
diet, allowing one hundred and fifty more grams of fat 
than the daily dietary of a healthy person requires. The 
change in diet must be a gradual one, as a too sudden 
reduction of the carbohydrates might prove fatal. Acids 
are constantly being formed from proteins taken into the 
body, and these burn in a carbohydrate fire, and acid for- 
mation increases when carbohydrates are cut down. The 
amount further increased, by restricting vegetables, the 
salts which neutralize these acids are diminished, and if 
not kept under control will cause acid poisoning. It is an 
imperative need that there be a movement of the bowels 
every day. If there be a neglect in this direction patients 
are more liable to succumb to acid poisoning. Bicar- 
bonate of soda is used in large quantities to aid in the 
neutralization of the acids. 

The first duty of the physician is to decrease the 
quantity of sugar in the urine, and as far as possible 
restore the power to assimilate carbohydrates, which is 
accomplished by resting those functions of the body 
which are used in the digestion of the same. If the latter 
is not accomplished the power to assimilate such foods 
gradually diminishes. 

A starvation diet for twenty-four hours, followed by 
a few days of oatmeal diet, and this followed by a few 
days of vegetable diet is often necessary to make a patient 
sugar- free. Tea and coffee (without sugar or cream) and 
beef tea and bouillon are allowed on a starvation diet. 
On an oatmeal diet from four to eight ounces of steamed 



230 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

cooked oatmeal are given daily (either in the form of 
mush or gruel) to which is added at serving time an equal 
amount of butter. Feedings should be given every two or 
three hours. Vegetables containing not more than six 
per cent carbohydrates are allowed on a vegetable diet 
and it is best to select the ones that will take up a large 
amount of butter. Tea, coffee, cracked cocoa, clear 
soups, broths, and bacon are also introduced. 

Proteins in Diet. 

The proteins in the diet of the diabetic must be obtained 
from animal foods, from which he can choose almost without 
restriction, as meats, fish, and eggs may be indulged in as the 
appetite dictates. Four eggs may be taken daily. Clams, 
oysters, and mussels contain glycogen (animal starch), 
which is a carbohydrate, therefore they must be avoided, 
except in mild forms of the disease, or allowed in re- 
stricted amounts. Liver contains so little glycogen that 
it is practically never necessary to restrict its use. 

Fats in Diet. 

Many people have a great repugnance to the use of 
much fat, therefore the problem of supplying a sufficient 
quantity to the diabetic is a perplexing one. It must be 
so combined with other foods as to disguise it as far as 
possible, and thus avoid the impression on the patient 
that he is eating a large quantity of fat. 

The best fats are butter, cream, eggs, cheese, olive oil, 
and the fat from bacon, meat, marrow-bone, and oily fish. 
A diabetic should take at least one-fourth pound butter 
per day, and one-half pint cream. There is but little 
tendency to gastric disorders among diabetics, which 
proves of much assistance in arranging menus. 

Green vegetables prove the most efficient butter car- 
riers, spinach heading the list: Other examples, cabbage, 
asparagus, string beans, etc. If a small quantity of 
potato is allowable it may take up one-half its weight in 
butter and one-fourth its weight in heavy cream. 



DIABETES. 



231 



Cream is preferable to milk, and should be used as a 
substitute for it as far as possible. There is about five 
per cent of lactose in milk, but only three to four per 
cent of lactose in cream. 

Cheese and olive oil form a very important article in 
the dietary and may be introduced without much difficulty. 
From the casein in cheese, however, sugar is readily formed.

Grape Fruit. Strawberries. 

Grape fruit and oranges are exceedingly popular and 
seem especially to agree with diabetics. There is rarely 
a stage of the disease when an orange or grape fruit can- 
not be taken once a day. 

Condiments. 

The use of condiments is not restricted. Salt, spices, 
flavoring extracts, vinegar, and table sauces may be used 
as desired, and are of much help in preparing menus. 

Alcohol. 
Brandy, whiskey, rum, gin, claret wine, sour cider, and 
Bollinger dry champagne are all used, the preference 
generally being shown for brandy ; three to six teaspoons 
are taken daily, while eight may be allowed. Brandy as- 
sists in the digestion of fats. While brandy is consti- 
pating under ordinary conditions, it does not prove so 
with the diabetic on account of the large quantity of fat 

in his diet. 

Beverages. 

One of the symptoms of diabetes is great thirst. Water 
may be drunk freely ; also tea, coffee, and cocoa nibs, with- 
out sugar. 

Diabetic Breads. 

The most difficult of all starchy foods to take from the 
diet is ordinary white bread. Many diabetic flours have 
been placed upon the market which have proved unsatis- 
factory. Bread made from these flours is seldom liked, 
and if it is tolerated and eaten in considerable quantity, 
as large a quantity of starch is taken as when wheat 
bread containing 55% is used sparingly. A small amount

of carbohydrates, especially oatmeal and potato, may be 
introduced into the dietary on the advice of a physician.

Sugar Substitutes. 

Saccharine (a coal-tar product three hundred times 
sweeter than cane sugar), which is added to foods for the 
diabetic is not harmful as is popularly supposed. It is 
usually purchased in the form of tablets. Siistoff , also a 
chemical substitute, is similar to saccharine, and is just 
being introduced from Germany into our country. Sac- 
charine is introduced to sweeten beverages and desserts. 
When used in desserts it must be added at the end of 
cooking, otherwise a bitter taste is developed. Most 
patients, after a few months of dieting, prefer to get on 
without saccharine. AVhen added to sour fruits it is of 
benefit in making the food less sour rather than making 
it taste sweeter ; therefore, avoid the use of too large a 
quantity. Dissolve a one-half grain tablet in one teaspoon 
luke-warm water and use as needed, add cautiously. The 
amount should not exceed 1 \ grains daily. 

The one who prepares the food for the diabetic should 
be in close touch with the doctor, and ever ready and will- 
ing to carry out his suggestions. The patieut had better 



234 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

not be consulted as regards the menus, nor have his 
attention called to what he is eating. 

It is most unfortunate if it is necessary for the invalid 
to prepare his own meals, as an appetite for the foods he 
most needs is greatly diminished. A diabetic should be 
in the open air as much as possible and exercise moder- 
ately but not get over tired. 

Frequent feeding is desirable for the diabetic, and 
besides the three meals, several lunches should be 
introduced.

Williamson's Diabetic Milk. 
A small piece of white bread, diabetic bread, almond 
cake, or unsweetened cracker is usually served daily at 
the time which seems to best please the patient. The 
quantity is determined by the presence or absence of 
sugar in the urine. Many of the so-called diabetic breads 
contain as much starch as ordinary bread.

CHAPTER XXX. 

DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 

CONSTIPATION. 

CONSTIPATION is due, usually, to a neglect in at- 
tending to the calls of nature. Those suffering 
from constipation should never forget the importance of 
regularity in this matter and should see to it each day at 
a fixed time. This regularity, without other treatment, 
often rids one of the complaint. 

Physical exercise and regularity in meals also play an 
important part towards keeping the bowels in a healthy 
condition. Those of sedentary habits are more liable to 
constipation than those engaged in a more active out- 
of-door life. 

Oftentimes cases of constipation may be overcome by a 
Buitable diet. If diet alone will not effect a cure, then 
diet with some medicinal remedy must be tried.' 

The simplest remedy is the increase of water in the 
dietary. Cold water to which a small quantity of salt is 
added, taken before breakfast and upon retiring increases 
peristalsis. Many of the saline waters are used to advant- 
age. Liquid vaseline, which is not digested, acts in a 
beneficial manner. Agar Agar, a Japanese sea moss, 
composed mostly of cellulose, increases the moisture in 
the intestinal contents nearly fifty per cent ; therefore its 
use is recommended. 

Coarse foods are recommended always for constipation. 
Such foods contain a large quantity of cellulose, and 
include cereals, coarse breads, vegetables, and fruits. 
They are bulky, slightly irritating, and leave much resi- 
due in the intestine. There is danger if such foods are 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 259 

taken in excess, as the bowels become tired from over 
stimulation and fail to react. 

Cookery plays a very important part in the digestion 
of foods. Cereals, coarse breads, and vegetables, if 
properly and thoroughly cooked, are well digested, and at 
the same time leave a sufficient residue to stimulate the 
intestines to action. 

Fruits, on account of the organic acids present, act as a 
laxative, and should be used between meals as well as at 
meals. The juice expressed from two oranges may be 
taken early in the morning to great advantage. Amoug 
the dried fruits, figs, prunes, dates, and raisins, cooked 
or uncooked, are useful in cases of constipation. 

Fats and oils tend to produce a laxative condition. If 
they have been introduced sparingly in the diet, they may 
be gradually increased until used in moderation. 

The foods most constipating are those that are well 
digested and most completely absorbed. An egg is an 
example of this kind of food. Milk seems to furnish an 
exception to this rule, for although it leaves considerable 
residue in the intestine it is recognized as a constipating 
food. 

DIARRHCEA. 

Diarrhoea is a frequent evacuation of the bowels. If 
the case is a mild one, rest and quiet, with a small supply 
of liquid foods, which yield little residue, will effect a 
cure. In severe cases it is sometimes necessary to ab- 
stain from all food for a short time, giving the entire 
body, as far as possible, complete rest. A patient 
quickly loses strength by withholding food, nevertheless 
it seems the best course to pursue. Hot water may be 
administered by the teaspoonful, and this may be followed 
by thin oatmeal gruel or rice water. Albumen water, 
tea, and blackberry and red wines may be introduced to 
advantage. Tea, and blackberry and red wines act as an 
astringent on account of the tannin they contain. 

From thin gruels gradually work up to thicker ones, 



260 FOOD AND COOKERY. - 

and. introduce milk into their preparation with some lime 
water. Frequently au egg may be added. Thin cream 
is well borne in teaspoonful doses. 

Scraped raw or rare roast beef and crackers may be 
added to the dietary as the condition of the patient im- 
proves. Preparations containing meat extracts always 
should be avoided, as well as aerated water, and, above 
all, cold milk, which would prove disastrous. 

STOMACH TROUBLES. 

The secret of good digestion lies largely in the proper 
cooking and mastication of foods which have been wisely 
selected. Regular hours for meals should also be ob- 
served if one wishes to avoid stomach troubles. 

The causes of stomach trouble, commonly called indi- 
gestion, are so many as to be almost without number. 
Over-feeding, under-feeding, improper feeding, late sup- 
pers, poor ventilation, overwork, want of exercise, worry, 
nervous anxiety, depression of spirits, all tend to retard 
the work of the digestive system. It seems to be the 
office of the physician to locate the cause and try as far 
as possible to alleviate the suffering by making changes 
in diet and administering medicine. 

Indigestion is usually located in the stomach, causing 
faintness, fullness, flatulency, hyper- acidity, hypo-acidity, 
or dilation. Sick headaches too are frequently caused by 
indigestion. 

Patients afflicted with chronic gastric troubles are more 
apt to under-eat than over-eat. When one is suffering 
from malnutrition as well as stomach trouble, the system 
is so reduced that the body as a whole needs to be con- 
sidered as well as the stomach. In dealing with such 
patients their personal idiosyncrasies must be considered. 
Perhaps there is no disease in which they play a more 
important part. 

Rest after meals is always to be recommended, which 
is best accomplished by lying down for fifteen minutes or 
even longer. 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 261 



HYPER-ACIDITY OF THE STOMACH. 

One of the commonest forms in which indigestion 
appears is hyper- acidity of the stomach, which is due to 
an excessive amount of gastric juice. This condition 
greatly delays the passing on of the food into the duo- 
denum by retarding the opening of the pylorus. 

A delay of food in the stomach favors the develop- 
ment of bacteria, also causing acid fermentation. It is 
wise to restrict albuminous food by cutting down the 
quantity of meat. A diet composed largely of meat 
produces an excess of acid in the gastric juice. 

Introduce milk into the dietary, which, being without 
extractives, calls forth the least gastric juice of all 
proteid food. Eggs are likewise desirable. It is well to 
increase the fat in the form of unsalted butter, cream, and 
olive oil. Begin by taking one-fourth cup of cream daily, 
and make a gradual increase until one-half cup is con- 
sumed. Fat seems to restrain the flow of gastric juice 
and is most efficacious, if well borne, taken before meals. 
Carbohydrates are apt to cause gas. For this reason give 
those containing the smallest amount of cellulose and 
most easily digested. Examples : — stale bread, rice, 
tapioca, sago, baked or boiled potato, and spinach, finely 
chopped. Hot water, as well as diluting the contents of 
the stomach, increases the frequency and the vigor of 
its muscular movements, therefore its use is advised. 
Warmth always tends to stimulate the opening of the 
pyloric. "Where expense is not considered alkaline waters 
taken with meals prove beneficial. 

Restrict the use of foods that increase- the acidity of 
the urine, namely, — spinach, rhubarb, water-cress, sorrel, 
tea, coffee, etc. Tea constipates and coffee acts as an 
irritant, but cocoa is allowed. Foods containing oxalic 
acid under ordinary conditions produce no harmful results, 
as so lar^e an amount of the acid is unabsorbed, while if 



262 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

hyper- acidity of the stomach is present this acid is so well 
absorbed that it leads to trouble. 

HYPO-ACIDITY OF THE STOMACH. 

In hypo-acidity of the stomach there is a diminished 
secretion of hydrochloric acid. The patient suffers from 
distress accompanied by gas, as soon as food is taken. 
Give such things as will stimulate the flow of gastric juice. 
Amoug proteins select beef juice, white of egg, and sweet- 
breads ; among fats, butter ; among carbohydrates, toast, 
cracker, rice, and macaroni. Food should be taken in 
small quantities at regular, frequent intervals. Brandy 
or whiskey, which act as a mild irritant, may be given in 
extreme cases. Sweet wines, ale, or beer should be 
avoided. 

ULCER OF THE STOMACH. 

The cause of ulcer of the stomach is not definitely 
known, but may be due to disturbance of circulation in 
stomach, to hyper-acidity, to some foreign body, to too 
hot drinks, or to a combination of these. It is most 
common in enemic or run-down people. If the trouble is 
not recognized it may become chronic. 

Ulcer of the stomach requires rest and restriction of 
all food by the mouth. 

A nutritive enema should be given every six hours, six 
ounces being administered each time, consisting of one 
raw egg, one-fourth teaspoon salt, and one-half cup milk. 
When this quantity is found to be well retained, gradually 
increase the quantity one ounce at a time until nine 
ounces are consumed. One teaspoon sugar may be 
added to each enema. 

An enema of water at body temperature should be 
given once during every twenty-four hours for the pur- 
pose of washing out the bowels, which greatly assists in 
the absorption of rectal feeding. An occasional enema 
of salt solution may be given, allowing one teaspoon salt 
to one pint water. 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 263 

When pain and vomiting have ceased, nourishment 
may be taken by the month, beginning with a thin water- 
oatmeal gruel, administering two teaspoons every two 
hours, and gradually increasing the amount to the limit 
of from one-half to three-fourths of a cup. If the water- 
gruel is well borne, introduce milk into its preparation, 
followed by milk to which lime water is added. Cocoa, 
chicken broth with rice, crackers, softened toast, and 
rennet may next be used. Never allow soups rich in 
extractives, and even in advanced convalescence avoid 
the use of irritating or indigestible forms of food. 



GASTRITIS. 

The feeding in gastritis should be along the same lines 
as for ulcer of the stomach, rectal feeding seldom being 
necessary. 

While all food should be withheld as long as the 
patient continues to vomit, to relieve thirst occasional 
sips of hot water may be allowed or small pieces of 
crushed ice may be held in the mouth. If the case ia 
chronic, any food that will irritate the gastric mucous 
membrane or excite a secretion of mucus must be 
avoided. 

Spices and condiments are forbidden, alcohol is pro- 
hibited, and usually coffee on account of the oil which it 
contains ; weak tea, however, is allowed. Cane sugar 
causes an outpouring of a large quantity of mucus in the 
stomach, which greatly retards the digestion of other 
foods ; consequently, if taken at all, must be used in 
very small quantities. Dextrose and lactose are much 
less liable to be harmful. 

Fat in the form of butter is well borne ; cooked fat of 
meats, sauces, and pastries would better be avoided. 

Bread should be thoroughly toasted, that the starch 
may be dextriuized. Such vegetables as contain a small 
quantity of cellulose may be used, and they should be 
served in a finely divided state. Potato puree, chopped 



264 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

spinach, and cauliflower furnish excellent illustrations of 
vegetables to be served to the sufferer of gastritis. 



DILATED STOMACH. 

Dilation of the stomach may be the result of a run- 
down condition of the system, when for some reason the 
walls of the stomach have become weakened, or the open- 
ing from the stomach to the duodenum has become small. 
Whatever the cause, the result is the same, namely, the 
food remains in the stomach longer than it ought, giving 
rise to acetic, butyric, and lactic fermentation, and C0 2 
gas is liberated. The large quantity of fermented food 
causes an excess of gastric juice. 

A striking example of a dilated stomach has been fur- 
nished by a woman who lost her right arm, and who ob- 
tained her livelihood by keeping a small store, from 
which fact her meals were often interrupted by custom- 
ers ; consequently her food was poorly divided as well as 
improperly masticated. 

If the case is not a severe one, great relief may be ob- 
tained by taking thoroughly cooked food that will not 
ferment in small quantities, and finely dividing and 
masticating the same. Beside the three meals, three 
luncheons should be introduced each day. The use of 
water must be restricted. 

An hour's rest in a reclining position is necessary after 
each meal, and the patient should be so raised as to 
assist the food in its passage from the stomach. 

The temperature of foods must be considered in feeding 
the patient. All cold foods cause distress. 

In the treatment of all stomach troubles, it is necessary 
to consider the quantity of gastric juices poured out. 
Albumen, as found in eggs and milk, calls forth very 
little gastric juice, while fats call forth none. 

The washing out of the stomach once each day in 
severe cases seems imperative ; and this treatment needs 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 265 

to be followed for several months, or until such time as 
there is no appearance of undigested food in the withdrawn 
contents. 

In restricting the amount of water in the dietary, it 
may be necessary to inject salt and water by the rectum. 
If the patient suffers no especial inconvenience, the 
amount of urine passed may drop from three pints, the 
usual daily amount, to one pint. 

Suggestions as to the Menu for a Patient suffering 
from a Dilated Stomach. 
Breakfast : 

Strained cereal. 

Cream. 

1 slice buttered toasted bread. 

1 egg. 
Coffee. 

2 lumps sugar. 
a. M. Luncheon : 

Glass of milk. 

Stale bread, rusk or cracker. 
Dinner: 

Roast beef or beefsteak. 

Vegetable (that may be finely divided). 
Example : Mashed potato, finely chopped spinach, 
asparagus tips, etc. 
These vegetables will take up quite a little butter. 

Simple Dessert, as Junket, custard, etc. 
r. m. Luncheon : 

Glass of milk with a cracker or 

Raw egg. 
Supper : 

Creamed Toast. 

Cold meat (thinly sliced). 
Before retiring : 

Glass of milk. 

Cracker.

HOW TO INCREASE BODY WEIGHT. 

A fattening diet is called for under the following 
conditions : — 

1. To store up fat. 

2. During convalescence after acute disease. 

3. In chronic wasting diseases. 

4. In some nervous diseases. 

There are many persons in apparent health who need 
to store up fat in order that they may be better fortified 
against disease, and that they may look better, not giv- 
ing the appearance of malnutrition. In order to accom- 
plish this, rest and diet must be considered. 

When thin people have exercised freely, cut down the 
exercise as far as is practicable to iucrease body weight. 
The three meals must be given regularly aud luncheons 
introduced. A weekly gain of one pound is better than 
a more rapid increase. 

Experience has proved that milk is an excellent kind 
of food to use in the diet. Begin by taking two table- 
spoons at the close of each meal and between meals. The 
amount to be increased by the addition of one tablespoon 
at each daily serving until a glassful is consumed. Milk, 
when taken for luncheons, should be served with a small 
cracker. Milk should always be sipped rather than 
drunk, and fifteen minutes should be employed in taking 
a glassful. 

Fats in an easily digested form burn slowly, have the 
advantage of much nutriment in small bulk, and are easily 
stored in the system as fats. For these reasons they are 
highly recommended for the fattening process, though 
they must be considered as expensive forms of food. 
There is danger, however, if they are used to excess, of 
overtaxing the digestion ; therefore carbohydrates as well 
as fats must be well represented in the diet. 

In general, carbohydrates are sufficiently used in the 
diet from the fact that most people have a natural crav- 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 267 

ing for sweets ; then again, both sugars and starches are 
inexpensive forms of food. 

Cream is a most acceptable form of fat, and is well 
borne and liked by most people. Like milk, it is well 
to introduce it gradually into the dietary, never allowing 
the quantity to exceed one-half cup daily. Encourage a 
free use of butter, as it holds high place both as regards 
digestibility and as a fattening agent. Vegetables are 
the best known butter carriers. 

A salad served with an oil dressing should be found in 
the daily dietary. If olive oil does not prove an agreeable 
addition to salads, the oil may be taken by spoonful doses 
at the close of each meal to advantage, and even though 
not enjoyed may be tolerated and endured. 

Among the fats of meats, bacon fat is especially well 
liked. The fats of other meats have been probably 
sparingly eaten or ignored in the dietary of a thin 
person. 

It is always wise to consider the tastes of the patient 
as far as possible in introducing an excess of fat into the 
dietary. If an occasional change is made, less emphasis 
is laid upon its use. 

One, two, or three eggs may be introduced daily as 
liked. The yolks of eggs contain a considerable quantity 
of fat, and it must never be forgotten that eggs are a 
valuable proteid food. 

Fruits stimulate the appetite and are often acceptable 
when served with cream. Alcoholic stimulants should 
not be used ; while beer and malt liquors are fattening 
their use would better be avoided except under the 
doctor's order. 

OBESITY. 

An excess of fat is almost invariably due to too much 
food with too little exercise. There are exceptional 
cases of obesity where only a moderate supply of food 
causes an excess of fat, but they are of less frequency 
than is usually supposed. Over-indulgence in diet is not 



268 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

uncommon to those of large incomes, and obesity usually 
follows, especially where little exercise is taken. It seems 
easy for such victims to deceive themselves as to the real 
cause of their complaint and attribute it to inherited 
tendencies. They generally assert ' ' it belongs to our 
family to be fat." Although some truth lies in this state- 
ment, a restricted diet, with sufficient exercise, must exert 
a change in the right direction. 

To treat obesity there must be a reduction in the 
amount of food or an increase in the amount of work, 
and sometimes both these considerations need play a part. 
It has been found safer to cut down the number of 
calories given rather than to restrict the use of any 
especial class of foods ; but do not introduce too large a 
variety or serve foods of which the patient is especially 
fond. 

A patient is quite likely to suffer from weakness and 
faintness when there is a loss of flesh occasioned by the 
cutting down of the food supply. These symptoms are 
overcome partially if, besides the three meals, three 
luncheons are introduced. 

In reducing the food supply, see to it that the proteins 
(tissue-building foods) are in sufficient quantity to keep 
up the strength of the patient. Van Noorden asserts that 
one hundred and fifty-five grams of albumen should be 
taken daily. Lean meat appeases hunger more than fish. 

It is desirable to cut off the fat in meats and avoid all 
kinds of fat meat and restrict the use of milk, except 
the small quantity that may be used with tea or coffee. 
Buttermilk, if liked, is a desirable beverage. 

Both sugars and starches should be used sparingly; 
therefore the supply of bread, potatoes, and cereals 
during periods of diet should be cut down to a very 
limited supply, while sweet desserts would better be 
avoided. 

Fruits and vegetables, being bulky foods, are well used 
with meats and eggs, which are concentrated foods. 

Water, saline waters, tea, and coffee are allowed as

beverages if taken in moderation. Alcohol should be 
avoided, but in cases of weak heart-action it is sometimes 
necessary to resort to its use ; then whiskey may be taken 
in teaspoon doses; also some wines containing a small 
percentage of sugar. Strong, sweet wines, liqueurs, and 
malt liquors should not be allowed. 

After all is said and done, experience has shown that 
no stated rules can be laid down for the treatment of the 
over-fat. Individual cases call for individual diets. In 
some it seems well to cut down the fats more than any 
other class of foods ; in others, the carbohydrates. It is a 
safe statement to make that the number of calories should 
be decreased about one-fifth from the standard to bring 
about the best results, which is a loss of body weight of 
about one-half pound weekly. In extreme cases the cal- 
ories are cut two-fifths with satisfying results, but with 
greater loss of body weights. When such a diet is re- 
sorted to it would better be adhered to for about one 
month, then a return made to a normal diet, followed by 
another period of restricted diet. 

When obesity is accompanied by heart trouble, then the 
greatest care must be taken as regards the food supply, 
and the patient's symptoms must be carefully watched. 

TYPHOID FEVER. 

Typhoid fever is a germ disease, infectious while not 
contagious, located in the small intestines. It is not 
possible to contract typhoid by contact with the patient, 
but danger lies from contact with the faeces ; therefore 
too much stress cannot be laid upon the immediate disin- 
fection and disposal of the same. 

Typhoid is largely attributable to an impure milk or 
water supply, while cases are recorded from the eating of 
raw oysters which have been contaminated from sewage 
which contained typhoid bacilli. 

If a physician were asked off-hand what he would rec- 
ommend for the feeding of a typhoid patient, he would 
say, most likely, feed the patient to the limit of his 



270 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

digestive capacity, which may be determined by the 
condition of his stools. 

No amount of food given to a fever patient is capable 
of establishing nitrogenous equilibrium, as there is such 
a rapid destruction of nitrogenous tissues. The micro- 
organisms which produce typhoid have a marked destroy- 
ing influence on the protein constituents of the body. 
From this statement one might draw the deduction that a 
large supply of protein food should be furnished, but this 
would add to the waste products, which are already ex- 
cessive, thus overtaxing the kidneys, which would be 
harmful rather than beneficial. Tissue-sparing foods 
may be liberally supplied in the diet in a carbohydrate 
form, as fats usually prove repugnant to a fever patient. 
Gelatin, although classed under proteids, is valuable, 
principally, as a proteid sparer, although its final prod- 
ucts are similar to the final products of all proteids. 

During the last few years an exclusive milk diet has 
been used by many physicians and in almost all hospitals, 
but the best authorities are now agreed that while milk 
should furnish the principal article of diet, other foods 
may be introduced advantageously, namely : Koumiss, 
junket, orange albumen, strained oatmeal and wheat 
gruels, chicken and mutton broth, soft-cooked eggs, 
bread, jellies, ice cream, and in some cases a small piece 
of broiled beefsteak or breast of chicken is allowed. 

Typhoid patients always require frequent feedings, — 
usually every two hours during the day and several time3 
during the night. There is a craving for cold water, which 
may be gratified, but it is best to restrict the quantity 
at any one time. Fruit beverages may be indulged in 
freely, as much water is ingested by their use. They are 
often fortified by the use of lactose for sweetening. Lac- 
tose has advantages over cane sugar, as it is less sweet 
to the taste, and under ordinary conditions does not 
ferment. 

When a strictly milk diet is depended upon, there is 
great danger of under-feeding the patient. The amount 
should never fall below three pints daily, and two quarts 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 271 

is usually considered necessary. "When milk is diluted 
with alkaline or effervescent waters, to make it more pal- 
atable or more easily digested, it must be remembered 
that its nutritive value is greatly diminished, a fact often 
overlooked by those caring for the sick. Koumiss is a 
form of milk which is well borne by typhoid patients. 

To make a liquid or semi-liquid diet bearable for any 
length of time without destroying all desire for food, it is 
necessary to offer as much variety as possible, and for this 
reason chicken and mutton broth are given to stimulate 
appetite rather than for their food value. Beef tea should 
never be allowed, as the extractives of beef are liable to 
excite diarrhoea, which, above all symptoms, is to be 
avoided. 

STANDARD DIET. 

Milk, 1500 c.c. (3 pints). 
Cream, 500 to 1000 c.c. 
Milk sugar, £ to If lbs. 
Eggs, 3 to 6. 

RHEUMATISM. 

In the dietetic treatment of rheumatism physicians 
differ greatly, but on one point they seem agreed, 
namely: That a moderate diet of well-cooked simple food 
must be enforced. Much out-of-door life is strongly 
recommended, with moderate exercise, and cold-water 
baths are usually fouud to be beneficial. 

Foods rich in extractives are avoided, also tea, coffee, 
and alcohol in all its forms. Beef is considered more 
stimulating than lamb or chicken, and is excluded from 
the dietary. Sweetbreads give rise to uric acid in the 
system, therefore they must be condemned by the sufferer 
from rheumatism. 

Cereals, milk, eggs, fresh fruit, and vegetables should 
form the principal part of the diet, and above all, good 
eating habits should be established, which consist of 
regularity of meals as well as a sufficient time for eating 
the same. Late suppers always should be avoided.

BRIGHT'S DISEASE. 



Bright's disease is a disease of the kidneys, and is 
recognized by the persistent presence of albumen in the 
urine, and the wasting of the affected organ. Bright's 
disease may be acute or chronic, and in either case rest 
the organ as far as possible. This may be accomplished 
by avoiding work or irritants for the kidney. The physi- 
cian recognizes the fact that the kidney is but a small 
part of the body, therefore does not forget to consider 
the body as a whole, and especially the heart, as that 
organ is overtaxed. 

In acute cases of Bright's disease the use of water is 
restricted to a moderate supply, one pint to two quarts 
daily. Formerly, in chronic cases, water was given freely, 
with the thought that thereby waste products might be 
more readily excreted. Van Noorden claims that waste 
products are excreted quite as well in a small as in a 
large quantity of urine, and his theory is verified by other 
noted authorities. 

A milk diet, in extreme cases, was formerly considered 
a safe one to follow. At the present time it is looked 
upon with suspicion, and the amount given should not ex- 
ceed a quart. Van Noorden asserts that too much albu- 
men is given if more than that quantity is allowed, a 
theory now adopted by the leading physicians of our own 
country. 

Albumen, in acute cases, for a time must be restricted, 
but as the disease becomes chronic care must be taken 
that the supply is sufficient for the needs of the body. 
From whatever source albumen is supplied its effect upon 
the urine is identical. 

While it has not been proved that meats are distinctly 
harmful, the quantity in the diet is of necessity restricted, 
on account of the albumen they contain. 

White meats are preferable to red meats, only because 
a smaller quantity is usually desired. 

Eggs, vegetables free from albumen (e. g. potatoes, 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 273 

rice), and fruits, being deficient in extractives, furnish 
desirable foods for the sufferer from Bright's disease. 
Fats may also be given. In chronic cases the amount 
of albumen given daily should not fall below forty-five 
grams, and as a rule from sixty to one-hundred grams are 
furnished. 

Among condiments salt may be used only very spar- 
ingly (five grams in twenty-four hours), since the kidneys 
do not excrete it well. If it accumulates it increases 
the amount of water in the body.

Vinegar being oxidized in the body, is allowed, and 
there seems to be no reason why lemon juice may not be

Alcohol in any form should be avoided. Exception must

coffee are forbidden on account of their action on the 
heart. The use of tobacco is avoided for the same 
reason. 

Apart from the dietary, a warm climate, with hot baths, 
frequent bowel movements, and a reclining position assist 
materially in the treatment of the disease.

HEART DISEASE. 

Heart disease is of two distinct types, — muscular and 
valvular. If the heart muscle is all right, the valve may 
be troublesome, yet not give much annoyance ; but if the 
heart muscle is weak, a leaky valve becomes more trouble- 
some. In cases of weakened heart muscle the organ may 
be dilated to twice its normal size. Foods play a much 
more important part than drugs in the treatment of heart 
disease. Give small quantities, always remembering that 
there is but one-fourth inch in thickness between the 
heart and the stomach and pressure upon the heart is 
dangerous. Such pressure takes place where death, it is 
said, is due to heart failure. Avoid such foods as stimu- 
late the appetite. As in kidney trouble, it is often neces- 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 275 

sary to decrease the amount of salt in the diet. The 
heartiest meal should be taken in the middle of the day. 
Reduce the amount of liquids and drink between rather 
than with meals. 

Restrict the amount of protein as it requires more work 
to burn up protein than carbohydrate, while the processes 
are many and difficult. 

CONSUMPTION (PHTHISIS). 

It is frequently the case that the illy nourished fall 
victims to phthisis, and the danger is increased if one 
has inherited tendencies to the disease. Statistics show 
that the death rate from phthisis is alarmingly large, and 
it might be materially lessened, and in a few years eradi- 
cated, if the strictest attention was paid to the burning 
of all sputum. 

On account of the great destruction of tissues in the 
consumptive, there should be given a generous supply 
of tissue-forming foods. The rations should be of such 
a character that they may be easily digested, and they 
should be given at regular, frequent intervals. Besides 
breakfast, dinner, and supper, there should be a luncheon 
in the morning, another in the afternoon, and still another 
before retiring. 

Hygienic surroundings and an ample supply of fresh 
air play as important a part in the treatment as the food 
supply. The good results obtained at the various sanita- 
riums are largely due to the fact that these important 
considerations have not been overlooked. 

At Rutland, Massachusetts, where many patients have 
derived much benefit, the open-air treatment is used, and 
all alcoholic stimulants are withheld unless especially or- 
dered by the physician. It must be mentioned, however, 
that only such patients are admitted as are suffering from 
the first stages of the disease. 

The patients are warmly clad both night and day. 
Duriug the day most of the time is spent out of doors, 



276 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

and some patients even sleep out of doors, and when not 
out of doors in a cold room constantly supplied with 
fresh air. Hoods, mittens, and moccasins are necessary 
as a protection in such an out-of-door life, and blankets 
are supplied almost without number. 

Patients are allowed a warm room for the cold-water 
baths, which are recommended, and also for dressing, 
after which time the heat is turned off, not to be turned 
on again until time to heat the rooms for undressing. 

Under this treatment a weekly gain of weight always is 
looked for, and patients are weighed at regular intervals 
that the increase may be recorded. The exercise is lim- 
ited, to assist in accomplishing this gain, while the food 
supply is greatly in excess of that furnished for a person 
in health. 

Many physicians are wont to send patients to the far 
West (Colorado or California), and while some have 
derived benefit from the change, alas, the greater number 
have been too wasted by the disease to receive permanent 
good. 

Consumption being an infectious disease, it is never 
wise to have a large number of cases in a single colony. 
Where large numbers have flocked to localities where the 
disease has been unknown, the cases have so multiplied 
that the error of the plan has been made apparent. 

Many patients who make a change of climate (select- 
ing a spot where the elevation is high and the air dry) 
during the early stages of the disease, are so benefited 
as to be able to return without suffering materially from 
the change ; while others find it necessary to remain for 
the rest of their lives, except, perhaps, for short vacation 
trips. 

Specialists of phthisis are agreed in believing that the 
most gratifying results come from 

1. A treatment of the disease in its first stages. 

2. A high and dry climate. 

3. A liberal supply of fresh cold air. 

4. Daily morning cold-water baths (when possible).

DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 277 

5. Light physical exercise in moderation. 

6. A liberal supply of easily digested food, known as 
the stuffing process. 

Fats, in the form of cream, butter, olive oil, bacon, 
and fat of beef, arc most important in the dietary of 
the consumptive, their caloric value being great in pro- 
portion to their bulk. 

Among protein foods, eggs play a very important part, 
as they are acceptable when raw, or may be cooked in a 
great variety of ways, either alone or in combination 
with other food materials. Many physicians advise giv- 
ing a large number of eggs, and cases are recorded where 
a patient has taken eighteen in a day, beginning with 
three, and adding one egg each day until this maximum 
is reached. While patients have gained on such a diet, 
there are some objections to its use. Patients usually 
tire of eggs when taken in such large numbers ; then, 
again, being less completely digested than when taken in 
small numbers, the use of a cathartic is imperative. 

Among meats beef holds first place, principally due to 
the fact that patients tire of it less quickly. The fat of 
beef is more easily digested than the fat of mutton, 
which among meats holds second place. Lamb, chicken, 
poultry, and game, all are introduced into the diet. 
Milk may be taken at the close of a meal, or between 
meals with a biscuit. There are few foods which need 
be excluded in feeding phthisis patients. It is a fact 
to be remembered, however, that when an excess of 
fat is taken the supply of carbohydrates should be 
diminished. 

When digestion becomes impaired by the stuffing 
process, oftentimes the use of some alcoholic stimulant 
will be found of great help as an aid to better digestion.

KNOX 




Knox Sparkling Gelatine 

COMES in two packages — the Plain 
Sparkling (Yellow package) , which 
is the original , unflavored, unsweetened 
package, and the Sparkling Acidulated 

(Blue package). Both packages con- 
tain two envelopes of gelatine and pink 
color in a separate envelope, and make 
the same quantity — two quarts. The 
only difference between the two is that 
the Acidulated package contains an 
extra envelope of lemon flavor, which 
takes the place of lemon juice. 
Knox Gelatine is a plain, straight 
product, and the flavoring and coloring 
is packed separately in each package, 
and not mixed with the gelatine to hide 
odors or other defects. To insure the making of attractive, health- 
ful and appetizing gelatine dishes for the sick and convalescent, 
one should use plain Granulated gelatine and add pure flavors, 
sweetening, seasonable fruits, etc. The juice from canned fruits 
makes a particularly pleasing and appetizing color. 

Gelatine Dishes are taking an important part in dietetics, and 
physicians are ordering it very largely in the diet of their patients 
while treating many diseases. The careful practitioner, however, 
recommends only a wholesome, colorless, odorless and tasteless 
gelatine, which is found in 

Knox Sparkling Gelatine 

and 

Knox Acidulated Gelatine 



THE YELLOW PACKAGE 



A great sunlit factory equipped with 
especially designed machinery does 
all the work of Knox Gelatine — 
hands never touch it until the house- 
wife herself opens the package. 



Knox Gelatine is used and endorsed by 

Miss Fannie M. Farmer and hundreds of 

other teachers of cookery

is measured for you (four envelopes to 
each package), and is also ready to use 
immediately without soaking. 

Both of these dainty products are ex- 
tremely convenient, put up so that they 
are great time savers in preparation. 

A free sample of either or 
both will be sent on request. 

MINUTE TAPIOCA CO., Orange, Mass. 






Serving 

The serving of food in a 
dainty, appetizing way is very 
nearly as essential as to have 
it pure and properly cooked, to 
appeal to a sick person. 

We keep an extensive assort- 
ment of moulds, cutters, rami- 
kins, casseroles and the various 
utensils used in preparing at- 
tractive dishes. 

We also have white enamel 
surgical goods, such as bed 
pans, pus pans, bandage pails, 
solution basins, and other 
hospital supplies.

A NOURISHING AND 
COOLING DRINK 

FOR THE SICK 

In convalescence, for weakness, nervous- 
ness or feverish conditions, Horsford's 
Acid Phosphate is safer, more palatable 
and more beneficial than lemonade or lime 
juice. 

Horsford's 

Acid Phosphate 

contains valuable nutrients — phosphates of 
calcium, sodium, magnesium and iron. It 
is, therefore, far superior to Dilute Phos- 
phoric or other acids. 

It is recommended especially for promot- 
ing digestion, strengthening the nervous sys- 
tem, and in wasting diseases. 

A teaspoonful in a glass of cold water 
makes a most grateful beverage. 

Nurses and physicians please write for 
free samples.

Metal Hot-Water Bottle 

Will Last A Lifetime 
"The Bottle with the Spring in it" 



HPHE CELLO Metal Hot Water Bottle is constructed along modern lines 
* and is the result of a progressive idea. Gracefully shaped, made of 
beautiful nickel plated brass, handsome, light and strong, it proves an article 
you would be proud to possess. It is absolutely safe, practical and non- 
leakable. Guaranteed for five years 
and with ordinary care should last a 
lifetime. It is an almost indispensable 
adjunct to the sick room. And where 
there are children it is an absolute 
necessity. This bottle is in use and 
endorsed by hundreds of hospitals and 
sanitariums because of its heat radiat- 
ing and heat retaining qualities. No 
home should be without a CELLO. 

By actual test it has been proven 
that the CELLO gives 50% more 
i heat than the old style faulty rubber 
R bottle and that it retains its heat one 
and one-half times longer under identi- 
cal conditions.

restorer of exhausted power ; but 
its quality must be good, and it 
must be carefully prepared. It 
is highly nourishing and easily

PREFACE. 



^ Food u the only tovaret of human power to work or to 
thinir 



n^HIS work is designed to meet the demands made 
-^ upon me by the numberless classes of trained 
nurses whom it has been my pleasure and privilege 
to instruct during my thirteen years of service as a 
teacher of cookery. 

It is earnestly hoped that, besides meeting this long 
felt need, it will do a still broader work in thousands 
of homes throughout the land, where it will be of in- 
estimable help to the mothers upon whom so much 
of the welfare of the family depends. 

The opening chapters are equally valuable to those 
who care for the sick and those who see in correct 
feeding the way of preventing much of the illness 
about us. 

Emphasis has been laid on the importance of diet 
from infancy to old age. The classification, compo- 
sition, nutritive value, and digestibility of food^ have 
been carefully considered with the same constant pur- 
pose of being a help to those who arrange dietaries. 
The chapter on infant feeding is an authoritative 



t«» 



ym PREFACE* 

guide to aid in the development of the baby, while 
child feeding is considered with like care. Consid- 
erable matter has been introduced with reference to 
diet in various diseases, and the recipes for the die- 
betic have involved much thought and labor. 

The hundreds of thoroughly tested recipes cover 
the whole range of the subject of cookery for the sick 
and convalescent. They are, for the most part, indi- 
vidual, thus requiring but a minimum of time for 
their preparation, while many have their caloric value 
given. 

I wish to express my sincere thanks for the sym- 
pathy, encouragement, and help I have received from 
pupils, superintendents of nurses, professors, and 
physicians, which have made this work possible.

SICK AND CONVALESCENT. 



CHAPTER I. 
FOOD AND ITS RELATION TO THE BODY. 

FOOD is that which builds and repairs the body, and 
famishes heat and energy for its activities. Meta- 
bolism indndes the processes by which food is assimi- 
lated and becomes part of the tissues, and the excretion 
of broken-down tissues as waste products. The body, 
by the analysis of its different organs and tissues, is found 
to contain from twenty to twenty-five chemical elements, 
of which the principals are : carbon (C), 21^% ; hydrogen, 
(H), 10%; oxygen (O), 62 J%; and nitrogen (N), 8%. 
Phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), chlorine (CI), 
fluorine (Fl), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sodium (Na), 
magnesium (Mg), and silicon (Si) are some of the others 
present. The elements found in the body must be sup- 
plied by the oxidation and utilization of the food stuffs, 
and the health of the individual will suffer if these are 
not properly maintained. 

Food adjuncts are such substances as stimulate the 
appetite without fulfilling the requirements of food. Ex- 
amples: tea, coffee, spices, flavoring extracts, condiments, 
etc., etc. 

While air is not classified as a food, it is essential to life. 
Combustion cannot take place without it, and all food 
must be oxidized (which is a process of slow combustion) 
before it can be utilized by the body.

The chief office of proteins^ is to baild and repair tis- 
sues, and they only can do this work. And this is tme 
only of the albnninoids. The body cannot appropriate 
nitrogen of extractives or gelatin. Gelatin acts as a tissue 
sparer rather than builder. Proteins also furnish heat 
and energy, and in cases of emergency are capable of 
supplying fat. The chemical elements found in protein 
foods are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, 
and generally phosphorus and iron. They differ from the 
other food principles inasmuch as they contain nitrogen, 
around which all chemical reactions centre, and nitrogen 
is essential to life. 

The principal animal proteins are meat, fish, eggs, 
and cheese ; the principal vegetable proteins are cereals, 
peas, beans, and lentils. The proteins obtained from ani- 
mal foods are more easily digested and more completely 
absorbed than those obtained from vegetable foods. This 

^ Protein is a comprehensive term which inclndes all nitrogenooa 
•nbetances and is used as a synonym for proteid. 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 8 

is due in part to the presence of the large quantity of 
cellalose in vegetables. During the oxidation of proteins 
ammonia is set free, which neutralizes the acids constantly 
being formed. 

The waste products of proteins are excreted by the 
urine in the form of urea. A well-balanced dietary con- 
tains all the food principles in correct proportions to the 
needs of the individual. It is possible to sustain life 
on proteins, mineral matter, and water, provided a large 
quantity of water is drunk. 

Ftoteins are the most expensive foods, and there is often 
found to be an insufficient quantity in dietaries, especially 
among the poorer classes. It is conceded to be true, 
that in the United States with those of large incomes 
there is an excessive use of proteins. There is a growing 
tendency among those who have given the subject the most 
attention to decrease the amount in the daily dietary. The 
actual requirement of protein necessary for the best of 
health is still a question for discussion. Atwater allows 
125 grams daily for a man doing an average amount of 
work, Voit 100 to 120 grams, while according to Chitten- 
den's theory from 40 to 60 grams is sufficient. The result 
of Chittenden's work has not met with general approval, but 
sufficient time has not elapsed for clinicians to discredit it. 
Between 75 and 118 grams is now generally conceded to 
be sufficient to meet all requirements. The body does not 
store up nitrogen except as used for tiie building of new 
tissues. Consequently when protein foods are taken in ex- 
cess (being complicated in structure) much energy is re- 
quired to break them up into the simpler compounds, the 
kidneys are overtaxed, and a poisonous irritating action in 
circulation is produced. Our people eat more than any other 
people, and do correspondingly more work. The grow- 
ing child suffers more from the lack of protein than the 
adult, as much material is required for building as well as re- 
pair. Until recently it was supposed that metabolism went 
on much faster in young cells, but now the greater activity 
of the child is held responsible for these rapid changes. 



4 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The chief office of carbohydrates is to famish heat and 
energy and store fat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen, the hydrogen and oxygen always being in 
the proportion to form water (HsO). 

Starch, the chief source of carbohydrates, abounds 
throughout the vegetable kingdom, being obtained from 
seeds, roots, tubers, stems, and pith of many plants. 
Examples : cereals, potatoes, sago, tapioca, etc. 

Sugars, the other source from which carbohydrates are 
obtained, are classified as follows : — 

rCane sugar (SacroBe). 
8ncro0M I Beet sugar. 
(Disaccbarids) ^ ^ — '^^ ' 



CuHssOii 



\ Maple sugar. 

I Malt sugar (BCaltose).

Hutchison. 

Carbohydrates include the cheapest kinds of foods and 
are apt to be taken in excess in institutions where large 
numbers are fed. They give variety and ballast^ and are 
the best absorbed of all compounds. 

Carbohydrates in the form of starch furnish a bulky 
food ; and while a certain amount of bulk is necessary, 
an excess causes gastric disorders. Sugar is oxidized and 
absorbed more readily than starch. The monosaccharids 
are ready for absorption, dextrose being the sugar found 
in the blood. Some sugar is absorbed through the walls 
of the stomach, and this holds true of no other foods ex- 
cept alcohol and a very small per cent of peptones (pro- 
teins). Practically no water is absorbed through the walls 
of the stomach. 

Sugar (sucrose), on account of its cheapness and com- 
plete absorption when taken in combination and mod- 
eration, makes a desirable quick-fuel food. Milk sugar 
(lactose) is equal in nutritive value to cane sugar. Being 
less sweet to the taste and more slowly absorbed, it is

often ased to advantage for infant feeding and sick-room 
cookery, where expense is not considered. The nsaal 
retail price of milk sugar is about thirty cents per pound. 
Milk sugar, under ordinary conditions, does not ferment 
and give rise to an excess of acids. 

Sugars are more rapidly oxidized than starches. The 
former may be compared to the quick flash of heat from 
pine wood, the latter to the longer-continued heat from 
hard wood. 




Showing how proteids, fats, and carbohydrates are split ap in 

the body. 

The starches furnish the necessary bulk to our foods 
and are also protein sparers. Proteins give such an in- 
tense heat that but for the starches much of their energy 
would be wasted. 

The waste products of carbohydrates are carbon dioxid 
(COs) and water (H,0), which leave the body through the 
lungs, skin, and urine. 

The fats and oils also furnish heat and energy, and 
constitute the adipose tissue of the body. Examples: 
Fats of meat, butter, cream, olive oil, etc. They are an 
expensive concentrated fuel wood, yielding two and one- 
fourth times as much energy as an equal weight of car- 
bohydrates. To those who do not consider expense in

feeding, there is a strong tendency to increase the use 
of fats and oils and decrease the carbohydrates, while 
in many respects they are interchangeable. '^ In the diet 
of chil^n, at least, a deficiency of fat cannot be replaced 
by an excess of carbohydrate ; and tiiat fat seems to play 
some part in the formation of yoong tissues which can- 
not be undertaken by any other nutritive constituent of 
food/' is a prevailing belief among competent observers. 

Carbohydrates (except small amounts in combination 
with nitrogen) and fats do not become integral parts of body 
cells. Fat is not deposited as fat in the protoplasm itself. 

Water constitutes about two-thirds of the weight of the 
body, and enters into the composition of all the tissues 
and fluids. To keep the necessary proportion, a large 
quantity needs to be ingested. One of the great dietetic 
errors is the neglect to take a sufiSdent quantity. The 
amount found in foods is insufiScient, and about five cup- 
f uls should be taken daily in beverages. A vegetable diet 
diminishes the need of water, while one composed largely 
of animal food increases tiiis need. 

Mineral matter is necessary for the building of tissues, 
being found, principally, in the bones and teeth. It aids 
in the digestion of foods, and also assists in the diffusion 
of the fluids of the body. Phosphate of lime, or calcium 
phosphate, is the mineral basis of bones. Potassium, 
magnesium, sodium, and iron are minerals, all of which 
are essential to life. They usually enter the body in 
organic compounds. Sodium chloride (NaCl), common 
salt^ is found in all tissues and secretions of the body 
except the enamel of the teeth. A sufl9cient quantity is 
obtained from our foods for the body's need : the average 
person, however, takes an additionid quantity as a condi. 
ment, thus stimulating the appetite and increasing the 
flow of gastric Juice*

^I^UJfi familiar comparison between the body and the 
^ locomotive engine serves as a most forcible illastra- 
tion for studying the fad valae of foods. 

Food famishes fael to sapply heat and energy for the 
body as wood and coal do for the locomotive. The food 
not only does this work, bat it must also baUd and repair 
the human structure, while the locomotive is not capable 
of making its own repairs. 

Latent heat is just as surely found in meat or bread as 
in wood or coal. They are both waiting to be oxidized, 
that they may be converted into heat and energy. As 
different kinds of wood and coal are capable of giving off 
different degrees of heat, and also giving off that heat in 
longer or shorter periods of time, so different food stuffs 
work in comparatively the same way. 

The subject of the fuel value of food is of such great 
importance that within the last few years much time has 
been devoted to experiments along this line, and the 
results have furnished much valuable knowledge to aid 
us in correct feeding. 

The latent energy in different foods has been deter- 
mined by their oxidation, outside the body, in the ap- 
paratus known as the bomb calorimeter. Still further 
experiments have been made with the respiration calo- 
rimeter. By this apparatus not only is the fuel value 
of all the food taken into the body determined, but the 
excreta, products of respiration, and heat given off by 
the body are measured. From this statement it can be 
seen that man himself is used in making the experiments. 



8 FOOD AND OOOKERT. 

ResnltB have shown that the oxidation of foods is the 
same in the body as outside the body. 

'^ The amount of heat given off in the oxidation of a 
given quantity of any material is called its ' heat of com- 
bustion/ and is taken as a measure of its latent or 
potential energy/' The calorie is the unit measure of 
heat used to denote the energy-giving power of food, and 
is equivalent to the amount of heat necessary to raise one 
kilogram of water V C. or about one pound of water 4^ F.

While proteins are capable of furnishing heat and 
energy as well as building and repairing tissues, it must 
always be remembered that their chief office is for the 
latter work. It is impossible for metabolism to go on 
without the production of some heat The proteins are 
the only foods that contain nitrogen. 

To determine the amount of nitrogen in a given food 
stuff, divide its grams of protein by 6.25. One gram 
nitrogen equals 6.25 grams protein. The excretion of 
nitrogen for a man of average weight is about twenty 
grams daily, the same amount being consumed. When 
the quantity of nitrogen is increased, there is a corre- 
sponding increase of its excretion^ thus establishing 
nitrogenous equilibrium.

How to datexmine the Caloric Value of any Food. 

It is necesBary to know the percentages of protein, fat, 
and carbohydrate to determine the caloric value ^ of any 
food. Wilii such percentages at hand in one hundred 
grams, by moving the decimal point two places to the left, 
is found the value of one gram. Multiply this amount by 
the number of grams called for ; then multiply the pro- 
tein and carbohydrate by four and the fat by nine.

12 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

A man of average weight (one hundred and fifty-foor 
pounds, or seventy kilos)^ at moderate work, requires 
about three thousand calories daily. The standard diet- 
aries include one hundred and eighteen grams protein, fifty 
grams fat, and five hundred grams carbohydrates. 

Protein 118 grams X 4 = 472 calories 

Carbohydrates 500 ** X 4 = 2000 «

A woman needs eight-tenths as much food as a man. 

The quantity of food required in a temperate and warm 
climate is about the same; the kinds, however, vary. 
Mother Nature, always wise and unerring, produces differ- 
ent crops to meet different needs. In our own country 
oats is grown in the northern part, rice in the southern. 

In a cold climate more food is needed, — a fact not due 
to the temperature, but to the greater activity of the 
inhabitants, — and fat forms a larger proportion of the 
diety as it is oxidized slowly in the body. 

A tall, thin person consumes more food than a short, 
stout person, for the reason that the larger surface ex- 
posed is the cause of a greater loss of heat. 

Age has a marked effect upon the rations needed. A 
child from three to five years old requires four-tenths as 
much food as a man at moderate work ; from six to nine 
years, one-half as much; while a boy of fifteen years 
requires as large a quantity as a man of sedentary 
habits. 

The abuses of diet in youth are responsible for much 
suffering which develops later in life. The laws of re-

tribative justice may be slow, but are, nevertheless, sure. 
Again, many of the diseases which occur after middle life 
are due to the habit of eating and drinking such foods 
as were indulged in during the early years of vigorous 
manhood. 

In advancing years, when growth has ceased and ac- 
tivity has lessened, food is oxidized more slowly ; there- 
fore, a smaller quantity is required, and that in a form 
to be easily digested. 

In arranging menus for individuals or families, per- 
sonal idiosyncrasies must be considered. It is a homely 
saying, but true, that, ^^ One man's meat is another man's 
poison." 

The ^'Dietary Computer," by Mrs. Ellen H. Bichards, 
is of great value to one whose desire it is to make out 
bills of fare according to food values. By its use money 
spent for foods could be used to better advantage, fami- 
lies would be better nourished, and disease would be less 

frequent. 
Experience has taught when it is best to eat, and what 

to eat. 

Nutrition depends upon, digestion, absorption, and as- 
similation. In health they work harmoniously. In disease 
where one is disturbed the others are affected.

CHAPTER nL 

DIGESTION. 

T^<X)D, before it can be utilized by the body, mast on* 
-^ dergo many mechanical and chemical changes to 
render it capable of digestion, absorption, and assimila- 
tion. 

Digestion is the conversion of insoluble and indiffusible 
substances into soluble and diffusible substances capable 
of being absorbed. Absorption is the taking up of the 
digested food by the blood-vessels and lymphatics and 
conveying it to tiie blood, by which it is carried to every 
part of the body. Assimilation is the taking up by the 
different tissues from the blood such material as they need 
for growth and repair. 

Digestion is carried on principally by ferments, and 
these act by contact Food is taken into the mouth, 
masticated by the teeth, moistened by the saliva, and 
coated by the mucin in the saliva, which makes it easy to 
swallow. The scUiva is an alkaline fluid secreted by three 
pairs of glands, — the parotid, submaxillary and sub- 
lingual. Ptyalin, which acts in an alkaline medium, is 
the ferment found in the saliva. It has the power of 
changing starch to maltose and dextrose, but has no effect 
on proteids or fats. The flow of saliva is continuous, but 
greatest during eating, about three pints being secreted 
every twenty-four hours. 

Thorough mastication is very important, that the food 
may be finely divided before passing on into the alimen- 
tary canal. If not well masticated it is retained in the 
stomach for too long a time, thus favoring the develop- 
ment of bacteria, which give rise to acid fermentation. 

The stomach normally contains few if any bacteria as 
they do not thrive where there is great activity or in an 
aoid medium. 



DIGESTION. 15 

Food IB forced by peristaltic action through the 0BSoph&- 
gus into the cardiac portion of the stomach, where it comes 
in contact with the gastric Jaice. The gastric juice is a 
fluid which contains hydrochloric acid (HCl) and three 
ferments (enzymes)^ pepsin, rennin and lipase. The flow 
of gastric juice is intermittent, but about the same quan- 
tity is secreted, daily, as of saliva. 

Pepsin acts upon proteid foods, changing some to al- 
bumoses and peptones, while by far the largest part is 
simply swollen in gastric digestion. Pepsin is the pria- 
cipal ferment which acts upon gelatin. Itennin is a 
milk-curdling ferment, lipase is a fat-splitting ferment 
recently discovered..

The digestion of starch continues for about one-half 
hour after entering the stomach; by that time the food 
material is sufficiently mixed with the gastric juice to 
render the whole acid, thus destroying the alkaline reac- 
tion. A certain amount of cane sugar is inverted (broken 
up into dextrose and Isevulose) by the hydrochloric acid 
in the stomach. Fats are set free, and to some extent 
melted in the stomach. About six per cent of proteins, 
twenty per cent of sugar, and some salts are absorbed 
through the walls of the stomach. Water passes on with 
the partially digested food. If the food is liquid, the 



16 FOOD AND OOOKERY. 

water leaves the stomach very quickly, and in drinking 
water some leaves the stomach before the last swallow is 
taken. 
The stomach plays a very important part in digestion : 

1. Mechanical: 

It acts as a reservoir and it reduces food to a liquid or 
semi-solid consistency. Both are very essentiaL 

2. Chemical: 

The actual digestion by chemical means is oompara* 
lively slight, but it is possible that the products of stomach 
digestion (chemical products) are important in stimulatii^ 
the mechanical and chemical processes in the rest of the 
digestive tract 

The stomach has two muscular motions. The first is 
a turning movement, which takes place in the larger or 
cardiac portion, mixing the food with the gastric juice, 
thus bringing the whole to a semi-fluid consistency. 

The second is a wave-like movement whigh takes place 
in the pyloric end, by means of which the food is allowed 
to pass by intervals into the duodenum, which is the 
entrance to the small intestine. 

The juice poured out in the pyloric portion contains 
no hydrochloric acid, but is neutral or slightly alkaline ; 
pepsin is present 

The quantity of gastric juice varies not only in differ- 
ent individuals, but in the same individual according to 
the diet. Extremes in temperature exert an influence on 
gastric digestion. Pawlow has made many very interest- 
ing experiments along this line, and has discovered that a 
diet composed chiefly of meat produces a large flow of 
gastric juice poor in ferments ; bread produces a small 
flow of gastric juice rich in ferments; while milk produces 
a moderate flow of gastric juice and a moderate amount 
of ferments. To keep in good normal condition without 
gain or loss of body weight, a plain, wholesome, mixed 
diet is the most satisfactory. 

There is great danger, especially in the young, of be- 
coming addicted to digestive habits. Each food calls 



BIQBSnON. 17 

forth a special gastric juice, and if tilie diet is limited to a 
few foods the power to assimilate others becomes lessened ; 
therefore if the diet is increased, gastric disturbances are 
apt to occur. When a patient has been kept for some time 
on a milk diet, other foods must be introduced gradually, 
and in small quantities, for the comfort of the individual. 

The stomach being capable of great distension, often 
gives rise to the taking of too much food at a single time. 
Three meals daily meet the needs of the average person. 
Dinner should be the heartiest meal, and should be served 
after the work of the day is over, when sufficient time 
may be allowed for eating, which may be followed by 
rest. 

In cases of impaired digestion, fifteen or twenty minutes 
is recommended for rest after each meal. Where a light 
breakfast is taken, a lunch should be indulged In in the 
middle of the forenoon. There are frequently found 
people of small stomach capacity who seem to require 
food at frequent intervals in small quantities ; whereas if 
a meal is taken which would serve the needs of the 
average person, gastric disturbances follow. 

Appetite has a marked effect on gastric digestion, and 
it is often necessary to stimulate the appetite. Attractive 
surroundings (plants, flowers, music, singing birds, etc.) 
are provided in institutions where money is not the first 
consideration. The sanitariums and hospitals in Ger- 
many are far in advance of ours in this respect Good 
cooking plays a far more important part than surround- 
ings, and it is the duty of the cook to stimulate the appe- 
tite by appealing to the sense of hearing, smell, sight, 
and taste. 

The digestibility of foods is calculated by the length of 
time they remain in the stomach. The average meal leaves 
the stomach in about four or five hours. The following 
table will be found of value in considering the ease or 
difficulty with which certain foods are digested.

Digestion principally takes place in the small intestine. 
The stomach acts as a reservoir for food, and plays a 
very important part, although instances are recorded 
where people have been well noiGrished after the removal 
of the stomach. There was^ however, a radical change in 
the diet, the food being taken in a liquid or semi-solid state. 

Food in the small intestine comes in contact with two 
fluids, — the pancreatic Juice and the bile (which is poured 
out from the liver), both of which are alkaline fluids. 
The flow of pancreatic juice is suspended except during 
digestion, while the flow of bile is constant but greatest 
during digestion. 

The pancreatic juice contains four ferments, — amylop- 
sin, trypsin, steapsin, and invertin. 

Amylopsin acts upon starches and completes their 
digestion. Trypsin completes the digestion of proteins. 



BIQESnON. 19 

Its action is similar to the action of pepsin in the gastric 
Juice^ bnt it is able to act in an alkaline medium. The 
proteins which were simply swollen in the stomach are 
now penetrated by this }aice and their digestion is com- 
pleted. Steapsin splits the fats into glycerine and fatty 
acids. The fatty acids combine with an alkaline solution 
and form soap. The bile salts also play an important 
part in the digestion of fats, but affect neither proteins 
nor carbohydrates. They, too, combine with fatty acids 
to form soap, and soap forms an emulsion. Fats thus 
emulsified are ready for absorption. Invertin acts upon 
cane sugar, changing it to levulose and dextrose. 

The action of micro-organisms is going on all the time 
in the intestines. Proteins are decomposed by bacterial 
action and carbohydrates fermented which gives rise to 
acids and gasea 

The liver acts as a storehouse for the body, to be 
called upon as needed. Some of the carbohydrates 
which during digestion have been converted into sugar, 
on reaching the liver are changed into glycogen, and 
glycogen is reconverted into sugar before* entering the 
general circulation. 

The digested food is now ready for absorption, although, 
as has been stated^ the digestion of all foods need not be 
completed before the absorption of some foods take place. 
For example, alcohol, sugar, and some proteins and salts 
are absorbed in the stomach. Liquids are the first to 
leave the stomach, then carbohydrates, proteins, and fats 
in the order given. 

White of egg (albumen) and skim milk as they require 
so little stomach digestion are the most quickly absorbed 
of protein foods. 

Food is moved along from the small to the large intes- 
tine by peristaltic muscular contraction. Absorption of 
food occurs almost entirely in the small intestine, and for 
the most part in the upper part By the time the intes- 
tinal contents have reached the caecum practically all the 
nutritive portion has disappeared. 



20 FOOD AMD COOKERT. 

Bile salts, on acconnt of their great yalae, are nearly 
absorbed before reaching the rectom, and are used over 
and over again. Salts, bile pigments, connective tissue, 
and cellulose are not digested (although some authorities 
affirm that the cellulose in young vegetables is partially 
digested) ; these, with the waste products of metabolism, 
are excreted through the rectum as f seces.

CHAPTER IV. 

FOOD AND HEALTH VERSUS DRUGS AND 

DISEASE. 

T\B,. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES is reported to 
^ have said, ^^ I can count on the fingers of one hand 
the drags commonly used by the general practitioner." 
Drugs are used at tlie present time to a less extent, and 
administered in smaller doses, than ever before. The phy- 
sician of to-day knows that the recovery to health from 
disease is a natural process, and administers drugs to assist 
nature rather than to effect a cure. The study of foods 
and their effect on the individual is of equal importance 
to the study of drugs. 

All infectious diseases are due to bacterial action. 
Germs enter the system in different ways. 

1. Through the gastro-enteric tract. 

2. Through the air passages. 

3. Through the skin, cuts, etc. 

4. Through the genito-urinary system. 

Drugs do not kill bacteria ; exception must be made, 
however, to the valuable discovery of anti-toxins, which 
have done so much for the advancement of medical 
science. 

The healthy person is constantly coming in contact 
with disease germs, but he is immune from the disease of 
which they are the cause, as anti-toxins are constantly 
being formed within the body which neutralize the poison- 
ous effects of the germs. 

Health may be defined as a sound mind in a sound 
body. The necessary conditions for health are : — 

1. A correct supply of food. 

2. The proper cooking of same. 



22 FOOD AND COOKEBY. 

8. Air and sunlight supply. 

4. Grood environment. 

5. Exercise. 

6. Rest. 

7. Sleep. 

8. Bathing. 

It \b safe to state that two^thirds of all disease is 
brought about by errors in diet, — either the food prin- 
ciples have not been properly maintained or the food has 
been improperly cooked. To one accustomed to visiting 
children's hospitals, or children's wards in general hos- 
pitals, this statement cannot seem an exaggeration, as 
the results of mal-nutrition are everywhere in evidence. 
Correct feeding should begin at birth, and continue through 
childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. Children more 
readily succumb to disease than older people ; herein lies 
the necessity of paying the strictest attention to their 
nourishment and care. 

. ^I have come to the conclusion that more than half the 
disease which embitters the middle and latter part of life 
is due to avoidable errors in diet, . . . and that more mis- 
chief in the form of actual disease, of impaired vigor, and of 
shortened life accrues to civilized man ... in England and 
throaghout central Europe from erroneous habits of eating 
than from the habitual use of alcoholic drink, considerable 
as I know that evil to be." — Sib Hbnbt Thompson. 

The effect of foods on metabolism is a subject which 
has received much attention during the last fifty or sixty 
years. ^' Metabolism is the sum of the chemical changes 
within the body, or within any single cell of the body, by 
which the protoplasm is either renewed or changed to per- 
form special functions, or else disorganized and prepared 
for excretion." 

As early as the seventeenth century the idea was ad- 
vanced that food furnished the necessary fuel for the 
body, but this theory attracted but little attention and 
seemed to be of almost no practical value as an aid to 
better living. 



FOOD AND HEALTH VERSUS DRUGS AND DISEASE. 28 

Towards the close of the eighteenth . century oxygen 
was discovered by Priestley, which explained the process 
of combustion, which he believed to take place in the 
animal organism as well as outside the body. Liebig 
made valuable advances in the study of metabolism, and 
later investigations have verified the truth of his state- 
ments. In 1840 he published a dietary study which, 
from the standpoint of modern work, on account of its 
incompleteness, is of but little value. Still it was a 
pioneer publication which gave much assistance to many 
of his followers. 

From 1850 to 1870 many experiments were made along 
these lines with animals, including cattle, dogs, and sheep. 
In 1865 and 1866 Voigt and Pettenkofer published the 
results of many experiments which they had made on man. 
To Voigt and his follows should be given the credit of the 
most valuable work of recent years. 

Thorough work of a very high order has been done in 
Russia from which much accurate knowledge has been 
gained. The name of Van Noorden stands out promi- 
nently on account of his work on metabolism. Japan, 
Italy, Sweden, and England hiave all furnished students 
who have aided science along this line. As Americans 
we are especially proud of that which has been done in 
our own country. Chittenden and Flint have been earnest 
workers, and more accurate results are being obtained 
each year at the expense of our own government, under 
the able direction of Professor A.twater. 

In the latest experiments account is taken of all food 
consumed, the excretory products, and the total energy 
manifested during the experiment, as heat or muscular 
work. The ideal has not as yet been reached, as no ac- 
count has been made of body gain or loss, or the energy 
stored or transformed during the experiment.

CHAPTER V. 

INFANT FEEDING. 

TT would seem that every child*8 birthright should be a 
^ healthy miud in a healwy body, but man is not yet 
wise enough and science has not opened its doors suffi- 
ciently wide to render perfect liying possible. StUl search- 
ing for new truth, each year adds its part towards the 
complete solution, and ^* It is a proper or improper nutri- 
ment which makes or mars the perfection of the coming 
generation." 

The power of the baby to grow mentally and physically 
must depend chiefly on its feeding, — although air and 
sunlight supply, environment, rest, sleep, exercise, bath- 
ing, and clothing all play a part not to be overlooked. 

A young baby is a young animal, and must eat, sleep, 
and use some muscular effort in kicking and crying (at 
least one-half hour 'each day), to expand the chest 
and gain strength. A baby should be handled but little, 
and kept as quiet as possible. Much sleep is necessary, 
for during sleep the child develops and grows. For the 
first month a child requires sleep from twenty to twenty- 
two hours daily; three months, eighteen to twenty 
hours ; six months, sixteen to eighteen hours ; one year, 
fourteen to fifteen hours. A child gets the best sleep 
in a darkened, well-ventilated, quiet room; for during 
sleeping hours there is a subconscious activity, and if 
there is light and noise present the nervous, muscular, 
and tissue growth are hindered. Avoid the use of too 
much or too heavy clothing or covering, as either is a 
hindrance to the best growth and development. 

The average weight of a child at birth is seven and one- 
seventh pounds for a male, while a female weighs about 



INFANT FEEDING. 25 

seyen pounds. Many children have greater weight at 
birth, while still others weigh less ; in either case the chil- 
dren are likely to be healthy. A child loses in weight for 
the first three or four days, but should regain its birth 
weight by the end of the second week ; then there should 
be a constant increase of body weight, which should be 
in proportion to the original weight The weekly gain 
should be from five to eight ounces until the fifth month, 
and from that time until the twelfth month the weekly 
gain is not as great, — about three and one-half to seven 
ounces. The child's birth weight should be doubled at 
five months and trebled at fifteen months. From these 
figures it can be seen that the most rapid gain is during 
the first five months. Regular increase in weight is the 
best and safest guide known for determining the health 
conditions of the child. GhUdren do not gain as rapidly 
during the summer months, this being especially true dur- 
ing the teething period. 

Nature has provided an animal food for the young of 
all mammalia, and mother's milk is the typical nourish- 
ment for her offspring in the early period of its existence. 
Statistics show that children among the slums of large 
cities will survive if fed from the breast, when if arti- 
ficially fed, death is almost sure to follow. 

The baby should be put to the breast six hours after 
birth ; thus the secretion known as colostrum is injected, 
whose office is to cleanse the alimentary canal, thus pre- 
paring it for the milk secretion, which appears usually on 
the third day. After bathing and dressing, if the child lies 
quietly, it is left until the time of putting to the breast, 
but if it cries, one-half tablespoon of sterilized water is 
given at about 99° F., — the temperature of the child at 
birth. Children, like adults, need more water than is 
found in the food, and the baby should be given one-half 
tablespoon boiled water every four hours, after the second 
day, — the quantity being increased in proportion to the 
increase of the stomach capacity. It is best to have the 
baby drink it from a spoon, especially if it is to be fed 



26 



FOOD AND COOKERY. 



from the breast; it is, howeyer, generally easier for the 
child to take it from a small bottle with nipple attached. 
If the bottle is used, it is sometimes difficult to get the 
child to take the breast. 

Regular feeding must be insisted upon as best for 
mother and child. It tends to keep the quality of the 
milk uniform, thus enabling the child to sleep better, not 
be overfed, and lessening the causes for indigestion. 
Too long intervals between the nursings produce a diluted 
product; while too short intervals, a condensed product 
If regular feeding is observed the milk supply will agree 
with the capacity of the child's stomach. By more fre- 
quent nursing the milk glands are stimulated to secrete a 
larger quantity, and the little stomach capable of distension 
is overtaxed. Mothers should be made to realize that 
upon this care during a few months much of the later 
health and vigor of their offspring depend.

That the baby may not be oyerfed, it is necessary to 
emphasize the stomach capacity at different ages; thus the 
following table may be of value: — 

Stomach Capacity.

At 4 weeks 2 oz.

• A mother's first thought should be for the welfare of 
her child, and she should wisely regulate her exercise and 
sleep, making an effort to control emotions and avoid 
nervous disturbances, which so readily affect the composi- 
tion of the milk. A plain, wholesome diet, including meat, 
^gs, fish, cereals, fresh vegetables, and fruit, is recom- 
mended. Highly seasoned foods, pastry, and an excess 
of sweet foods should be avoided. Milk, or a beverage of 
which the principal constituent is milk, should be taken. 
While tea and coffee are not prohibited, cocoa is much 
more desirable. Oftentimes the three meals prove insuf- 
ficient, and a luncheon may be introduced in the forenoon, 
and milk or gruel before retiring. 

If the mother's milk proves inadequate to the child's 
needs, it often may be made suitable by change of diet 
and proper exercise. A child will lose on too rich a food 
as well as one lacking in nutritive value. The protein 
and fat in human milk are subject to variations, while the 
mineral matter and milk sugar are nearly constant. 

To increase the supply of milk, increase the liquid in 
the diet. To decrease the supply (which is seldom neces- 
sary), decrease the liquid. To increase the amount of 
protein, eat more meat and decrease the exercise; to de- 
crease the quantity, eat less meat, increase the quantity 
of liquid, and increase the exercise. To increase the fat, 
increase the meat, and also fats in a readily digested form, 



28 FOOD AND COOKBBT. 

and walk two miles daily. To decrease the fat, eat cor- 
respondingly less meat and fat. 

Too much protein, which is the result of a large amount 
of meat, in the diet with little exercise, causes constipa- 
tion and colic. If the fat is increased with the protein, 
diarrhoea and vomiting follow.

By comparing the tables showing the composition of 
human and cow's milk, it will be seen that cow's milk 
contains more protein and mineral matter and less sugar 
of milk, the fat and water varying but little. The calf 
grows faster than the baby, therefore needs more building 



INFANT FEEDING. 29 

material. The baby^ having a relatiyely larger surface 
exposed, loses more heat 

The protein of mUk is composed of lactalbnmin and 
caseinogen. Lactalbnmin is soluble in water, and as there 
is a larger percentage of this constituent in human than 
in cow's miQk, the former during digestion forms into 
succulent curds; while the latter, containing more case- 
inogen, forms into dense cheesy curds. 

Certified milk is the ideal artificial food for infant feed- 
ing, samples of which have been found to contain even 
less than 80,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter, while sale- 
able milk often contains as many as 500,000 bacteria per 
cubic centimeter. Milk of this standard can only be 
produced by taking the greatest pains and following the 
most strenuous precautions. The cows must be healthy 
and kept clean and properly fed, and they must be housed 
with due consideration in respect to fresh air, sunlight, 
and cleanliness. The milkers must keep themselves scru- 
pulously clean, and wear washable uniforms. Only by 
legislation can these standards be maintained. Milk which 
is sold as certified milk comes from farms which are in- 
spected at regular frequent intervals by medical boards, 
and the milk is tested in bactereological laboratories. 

It commands a high price on account of the cost of 
production, which prevents a more general distribution. 
It is necessary during the summer months to insure the 
health of infants, that they be fed on clean milk. In 
conjunction with artificial feeding it has been found that 
sick babies on the Boston Floating Hospital, by the addi- 
tion of one or two feedings of breast milk in tiie twenty- 
four hours, responded very quickly and were soon on the 
convalescent list 

Milk directiy from the cow is practically sterile, but is 
quickly contaminated. Milk being one of the best-known 
culture mediums, when once bacteria gain access they 
thrive and grow very rapidly. 

CoVs milk, to form a typical infant food, needs to be 
modified. In many large cities throughout the United 



80 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

States, laboratories, with accompanying farms in outlay- 
ing districts, have been established to famish proper in- 
fants* food. While human milk is self-modifying, thus 
meeting the needs of the child in the different stages of 
its growth and development, its composition varies but 
little during the period of lactation. 

The modification of laboratory milk needs to be changed 
from time to time according to a physician's formula, lime- 
water being added to neutralize the acid present in cow's 
milk. Human milk is sterile, while cow's milk, in the 
hands of the consumer, contains many varieties of bac- 
teria; therefore it was formerly thought advisable to 
sterilize the modified product ; but sterilization has been 
largely superseded by pasteurization, and this is not deemed 
necessary or advisable, where fresh milk can be procured 
from a reliable source, except in cases of bowel trouble 
or in extremely hot weather. 

A child should not remain at the breast for more than 
fifteen or twenty minutes at each feeding. Never wake 
a healthy baby during the night for feeding. It is some- 
times necessary during the day, as a young child is quite 
liable to turn night into day ; but by persistent effort this 
may be overcome before it is an established habit. 

If for any reason the mother is unable to nurse her 
child, she must make a decision between a wet nurse and 
artificial feeding. Cow's milk is best adapted for artificial 
infant feeding, although in its composition it is not as 
nearly like human milk as the asses' or the mare's. Cows 
can be kept more easily under strict control than most 
animals, and when carefully stabled, fed, watered, and 
cleaned, produce a food which can be modified to meet the 
baby's needs. Durham, Devon, Ayrshire, and Holstein 
breeds are most satisfactory. Always procure milk from 
the herd rather than from a single animal. If the supply 
be obtained from a single cow, it is not uniformly as good 
quality, for an indisposition, fright, or worry of the animal 
affects the milk, and this in its turn reacts upon the 
child. 



INFANT FEEDING. 31 

Among intelligent and care-taking mothers, home modi- 
fication is being saccessfally employed^ always nnder 
the direction of a physician. By this method a mixture 
can be easily prepared containing any percentage of fat^ 
sugar^ and protein suited to the needs of the individual 
baby from the most delicate weakling to the healthy infant 
It has advantages over laboratory modification, namely : — 

1. Less handling. 

2. Shorter time from milking to consumer. 

3. Gravity cream digests more readily than centrifugal 

cream. 

4. Less handling renders pasteurization seldom nec- 

essary. 

Three methods are employed for separating the cream 
from the milk: 

1. Pouring. 

2. Chapin dipper. 

3. Siphoning. 

By the first and second methods mothers may be easily 
taught to do the work without much trouble, and while the 
result in percentage is not absolutely correct it is gener- 
ally quite satisfactory. By the third method (the one 
employed on the Boston Floating Hospital as well as in. 
nearly all institutions where special attention is given 
to the feeding of infants) the work is accurately done 
under perfect aseptic conditions. As it is much more 
complicated it requires the attention of thoughtful, intelli- 
gent persons, and mothers are only too glad to carry out 
the instructions of the physician or trained nurse for the 
welfare of their children. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to give formulas for

Bottles and nipples for infant feeding should be of the 
simplest construction, that, easily, they may be kept 
perfectly clean. As soon as baby has finishcKl nursing, 
the nipple should be removed from bottle, and nipple 
and bottle thoroughly washed, then the bottle filled with 
water and the nipple immersed in water. Both should be 
made sterile each morning, when the number of feedings 
for twenty-four hours is prepared. The nipples should 
be allowed to remain in boiling water five minutes, and 
then immersed in cold water, to stand until needed.

Pat milk in sterile, Bmall-mouthed glass bottles, stop 
with cotton batting or absorbent cotton, place bottles

and heat water gradually, to a temperature of from 
150^ to 155*^. Keep at same temperature thirty min-

place. 

By this process almost all of the disease germs are 
killed ; also those germs which produce souring ; but the 
spores, which are not killed, will develop after a few 
days. If one is obliged to obtain milk from a doubtful 
source it may be necessary to resort to this method during 
the hot weather. The health of the child is the only guide 
to decide when its use may be discontinued. 



How to steziliae Bfilk. 

Proceed as in the pasteurization of milk, raising the 
temperature of the water to the boiling point (212^ F.) 
and keeping at this temperature thirty minutes. Sterili- 
zation is an efficient method of destroying ail germs, but 
alters the taste of milk, coagulates the albumen, destroys 
the fine emulsion of fat, and renders the casein less easy 
of digestion. 

Sterilizers are on the market which simplify the process 
of sterilization, and their use is recommended where 
expense need not be considered. 

Sterilized milk should not be fed to infants except 
under rare conditions and its use discontinued as soon as 
the case will permit 

To determine the caloric value of milk modified for 
infant feeding, multiply the percentage of fat in formula 
by three, and the sugar plus the protein by one and three- 
tenths.

CHAPTER VL 
CHILD FEEDING. 

A CHILD fed from the breast is weaned, usaally, from 
the eighth to the twelfth month, the time depend- 
ing upon the health of both mother and child, as well as 
the season of the year. Unless compulsory, this change 
would better not take place during the summer months. 
Changes in diet should always be gradual ones, which is 
not the exception with the baby. Healthy children may 
be taught to drink from a cup or mug before taken from 
the breast, which will dispense with the use of the bottle. 
On the other hand, oftentimes ill or delicate children will 
not take sufficient nourishment in this way, and the bottle 
becomes a necessity for the welfare of the child. Baby 
not only eats better, but sleeps better, and keeps happier. 

Some children are allowed to use the bottle at nap and 
bed time until two years of age. While this seems to 
many an over-indulgence to the child, it is sometimes 
recommended by physicians as the best course to pursue. 

A healthy child of from eight to twelve months may be 
given a crust of stale bread, educators, rusks. Zwieback, 
and strained, well-cooked cereal diluted with milk. The 
necessity for an occasional drink of water, which was em- 
phasized in infant feeding, must not be overlooked in 
child feeding. 

From twelve to sixteen months a child requires four 
meals daily. 

Meals. ^ Timet for Serving. 

Breakfast 7.30 a.m. 

Lunch 11.30 a. m. 

Dinner 2.30 p.m. 

Supper 5.30 p.m. 



CHILD FEEDING. 87 

If a child wakes very early, it may be given a crust of 
bread, a cracker, or a small quantity of milk, but not 
enough to take away the appetite for breakfast 

For breakfast, serve a cereal sprinkled with sugar (spar- 
ingly) and top milk. Well-cooked, strained oatmeal, 
hominy, or any of the wheat preparations may be used, 
and it is desirable to offer variety. A glass of milk 
should accompany this meaL 

For luncheon, give strained cereal and milk, allowing 
three parts milk to one part cereaL In order that the 
child may have sufficient nourishment, pour off the upper 
half of quart jars of milk (top milk). In this way the 
necessary fat is supplied. 

For dinner, serve a soft-cooked egg, or beef, chicken, 
or mutton broth thickened with strained rice or barley ; 
either with a piece of stale bread spread with butter, fol- 
lowed by steamed rice with cream and sugar, steamed or 
baked custard, Junket custard, Irish moss blanc mange, 
strained stewed prunes, or juice of one-half orange. When 
eggs are introduced into the diet for the first few times, give 
but one-half egg. This quantity ibay be easily digested, 
while a whole egg might cause gastric disturbance. 

For supper, serve strained cereal and milk, same as for 
lunch. A child from sixteen to twenty-four months takes 
four meals, with the same hours for serving as the younger 
child, with some greater variety. 

For breakfast, in addition to cereal, give '^ soft-boiled," 
dropped, or coddled egg. Scrambled egg, if cooked with a 
small quantity of butter, may be occasionally served. It is 
well at this age to introduce one egg daily into the diet. 

For luncheon, give bread and butter, cracker, or cereal 
Jelly with sugar and top milk in addition to the luncheon 
before served. 

For dinner, mashed baked potato, beef Juice, boiled rice, 
or macaroni may be added. 

For supper, whole wheat or Graham bread spread with 
butter, stewed prunes, baked apple or apple-sauce, in 
addition to the supper before served. 



38 roOD AND COOKERY. 

Children over two years of age may b^n to take fieh, 
meat, vegetables, and fruits. White fish, broiled, steamed, 
or boiled, may be given in place of egg. Broiled lamb 
chops, broiled beefsteak, or rare roast beef, broiled or 
roasted chicken, or boiled fowl, are all suitable food, if 
introduced occasionally in small quantities. Spinach, 
asparagus tips, young tender string beans, and peas 
forced through a strainer, are aU allowable. Fresh ripe 
strawberries, served with sugar, but not cream, may be 
eaten in the early part of the day, but should never be 
allowed after dinner. Blueberries and huckleberries had 
better not be introduced until after the fifth year, as they 
often act as irritants and give rise to summer complaints. 

Some children express a desire for bananas, which may 
be satisfied if the fruit is scraped to remove the astringent 
principle which lies close to the surface. Many physicians 
think they are more easily digested when baked. 

Cocoa, as well as milk, may be given as a beverage. 
The menu at this age is so varied, and the digestive 
powers of the child so increased, that strained cereals will 
no longer be necessary. Indian meal mush may now be 
taken, as well as the oat and wheat preparations ; also the 
cooked cereal products, put up ready for serving. 

Always avoid the use, in the dietary of a young child, 
of salted meats, pork, or veal, coarse vegetables (beets, 
carrots, turnips, etc.), cheese, fried foods, pastry, rich 
desserts, condiments, tea, coffee; beer, or any alcoholic 
stimulant, and iced water. 

The child's craving for sweets is a natural one and 
should be gratified. This is accomplished in part by 
sugar served with cereal and desserts. Vanilla chocolate 
is a most desirable food, as well as sweetmeat, and if 
eaten at the close of a meal is beneficial rather than 
harmful. Perhaps no food containing albumen, carbohy- 
drate, and fat is as well absorbed as chocolate. All the 
sugar is taken up, and there is a loss of only two per cent 
of the albumen, starch, and fat. 

The injurious effects of pure chocolate and candy are

due to their being eaten between meals or in excess, 
which destroys the appetite for plain, wholesome food. 

When the time arrives that the nap is no longer needed, 
which time varies with different children, three meals 
nsnally snffice. The dietary may be gradually increased, 
until the child is able to partake of the family menu, 
avoiding, of course, a night dinner. The wise mother 
will encourage and continue a resting time until school 
hours interfere, even though not followed by sleep. 

The food of the child at school is of equal importance 
to the food of the infant. It must not be forgotten that 
digestive processes go on quickly, and activity is so great 
in childhood that an abundant supply of well-cooked, 
nourishing food is essential for both the development of 
body and mind. The irritability and weak nervous con- 
dition of school children, which is often attributed to 
over-study, is more often the result of excitement, want 
of sleep, and malnutrition. 

Never allow a child to go to school without a proper 
breakfast, of which a cereal served with sugar and rich 
milk or cream should form the principal dish. 

Many children enter kindergarten at the age of three 
and one-half or four years, most of whom carry a luncheon, 
a few minutes being set aside for the purpose of eating 
the same. This luncheon should be very simple, and 
limited in quantity, that the appetite may not be destroyed 
for the hearty dinner. In many cases where a child is 
fortified wil^ a good breakfast, the luncheon would better 
be omitted, as the child has a better appetite and enjoy- 
ment of the midday meal. In kindei^artens attended by 
the poor, a luncheon is an absolute necessity to the child's 
welfare, and fortunate is the community where an appro- 
priation is made for the supply of milk, with bread or 
crackers, or occasionally hot broth in the place of milk. 

If the older child attends a one-session school, the 
luncheon must not be overlooked. Whatever else goes 
into the luncheon basket, sandwiches must hold first 
place. If a variety is introduced and pains are taken in

their preparation, the little ones will look forward to 
them with as much interest as the sweets which follow. 
Doughnats, rich cake, and pastry should be avoided, bat 
simple crackers, cookies, and cakes may be used to 
advantage; also fresh and dried fruits and nuts. Figs, 
dates, and nuts have a high food value, and if well masti- 
cated, an active child will digest them with comparative 
ease. 

In the high schools of many large towns and cities, 
lunch counters have been established for furnishing to the 
pupils well-cooked, nutritious food, at the least possible 
expense. Hot soups and cocoa may be found each day 
in addition to rolls, sandwiches, crackers, cookies, cake, 
fruit, and sometimes ice cream. 

A child, relatively to his weight, requires more food 
than a man or a woman. Three considerations explain 
this necessity: — 

1. The assimilative powers of a child are greater than Uiose 
of an adult. 

2. A child has a larger surface in proportion to his weight ; 
which means a relatively larger heat loss. 

3. A child is growing, therefore requires a relatively larger 
supply of building material.

Children mast have, for their best mental and physical 
development, a relatively larger proportion of proteid and 
fat in the dietary than their elders. The baby receives 
his proteid and fat from milk and cereals, bnt the older 
child needs, in addition to these, eggs, meat, and butter. 
Much of the pallor and stunted growth of some children is 
largely attributable to the lack of these very foods. 

As carbohydrates furnish the cheapest form of food, 
they are almost never found wanting, and oftentimes are 
used to excess. Carbohydrate in the form of sugar, if 
injudiciously given, may prove harmful, but if used wisely, 
when it does not interfere with digestive processes, is a 
most useful fuel food. 

The notion that sugar injures the teeth is largely a false 
one. If children are allowed to eat candy or cookies after 
the teeth have been brushed for the night, then the sweets 
which collect between them cause decay. 

Milk, eggs, and meat are sources for furnishing mineral 
matter, but the chief value of fruit and vegetables lies in 
this food constitutent, upon which tissue growth so much 
depends.

CHAPTER Vn. 
FOOD FOB THE SICK. 

THE feeding of persons in health is of great impor- 
tance, but when one saccumbs to disease, then 
feeding becomes a question of supreme moment. The 
appetite in health is usually a safe guide to follow, but is 
so perverted by disease conditions that it is unwise to 
consider its cravings. If these cravings are indulged, 
the food longed for is almost always a disappointment, 
as all things taste about the same, until the time of 
convalescence. 

Never consult a patient as to his menu, nor enter into a 
conversation relating to his diet, witbin his hearing. The 
physician in attendance studies the symptoms so closely 
that he is able to determine what is required to meet the 
needs of the case. He orders nourishment given regularly, 
usually in small quantities, at frequent intervals. Ap- 
preciating the value of sleep, he never allows his patient 
to be awakened for feeding, unless the exigencies of the 
case create this demand. 

In acute cases of disease, food plays a very important 
part towards recovery. The quanti^ and kind taken 
must vary greatly, according to the nature of the disease. 
Sometimes it proves expedient in cases of diarrhoea or 
dysentery to have the patient abstain for days from all 
food, except a very thin, starchy gruel, the object being 
to starve the germ which causes the disease ; then, again, 
a patient, after a surgical operation, where there is a 
great loss of blood, needs a large supply of food. 

Where the temperature is high, metabolism goes on so 
rapidly there is always a demand for a large quantity of 



lb &

emsily digested food, usually in a liquid form. Water 
is given freely, to assist in carrying off the waste 
products. 

In chronic cases, by a careful study of the food sup- 
ply, much can be done to keep up the strength of the 
patient while endeavoring to overcome the disease. The 
greater the activity of the patient, the greater the need 
for food. 

Personal idiosyncrasies in disease, as well as in health, 
play a very important part Avoid giving food that will 
overtax the digestion or disagree with any of the con- 
ditions of the patient. Food must be assimilated to 
be of value. The teeth, the mouth, the stomach, and 
the intestines all must be considered. Some food, if 
well masticated, might' easily pass from the stomach 
into the intestines, while if not masticated, might prove 
a stomach irritant. Some food that would not prove 
Irritating to the stomach would cause fermentation in the 
intestines. 

Many patients during the early stages of convalescence 
have an abnormally large appetite, which must be re- 
stricted, as over-feeding would prove dangerous; while 
with others the appetite needs to be stimulated. 

Important things to consider in feeding the sick : 

1. Appeal to the sense of sight. 

2. Appeal to the sense of taste. 
8. Consider temperature. 

4. Digestibility. 

5. Nutritive value. 

6. Economy. 

During the gradual return to a normal condition, 
through the long tedious hours of convalescence, the 
patient devotes much thought to when and what he shall 
be allowed to eat, and it is at this time that the taste is 
gratified as far as is advisable. 

The best means of stimulating the appetite is to have 
good food, well cooked, and attractively served. The 



44 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

service should be the best at the command of the nurse, 
and too much attention cannot be given to every detail. 
The trays should be of correct size, so when laid not to 
have the appearance of being overcrowded; on the other 
hand, if a small amount is to be served, have a small tray. 
The tray cloth should be spotless, and just fit over edge 
of tray. If the correct size is not at hand, one should be 
folded to fit tray, or a napkin may often be utilized for 
this purpose. Select the choicest china, silver, and glass- 
ware, making changes as often as possible. It often 
proves pleasing to carry out a color scheme. Nervous 
patients are apt to be depressed in the early morning, 
therefore for this reason make the breakfast tray as 
attractive as possible by using bright flowers. 

In setting a tray after laying the tray cloth, locate the 
plate. Place the knife at the right of plate, sharp edge 
toward plate. Place the spoon at the right of knife, bowl 
up. Place the fork at the left of plate, tines up. A 
bread and butter plate or individual butter is placed 
over fork a little to the left. The napkin is always 
placed at left of fork ; then cup and saucer at right of 
spoon, with cup so placed that it may be easily raised 
by handle. The water glass is placed over knife at little 
to right Arrange the other dishes to suit the convenience 
of the patient 

All eating is very much influenced by the taste. Some 
foods, easy of digestion, if repugnant to a patient, prove 
indigestible. 

The temperature of food has a marked influence upon 
digestion. As a rule, hot foods should be served hot, 
cold foods served cold; but this often must be varied 
according to the case. Under certain conditions very 
cold or very hot food might retard digestion, thus increas- 
ing the amount of energy necessary for absorption. 

Coarse foods, like Graham bread, some cereals, and 
vegetables cofitaining much cellulose, pass through the 
alimentary canal so quickly that much of their nutritive 
value is lost, as so large a portion escapes absorption. 



FOOD FOB TH£ SICK. 45 

Sugar is completely absorbed by the system, while starch 
holds second place. The proteid of meat and eggs is well 
absorbed, only three per cent being lost ; in milk the loss 
is eight per cent. Fat, when taken in the form of butter, 
is almost completely absorbed, while in the absorption of 
fat in the form of milk, eggs, and cheese, there is a loss 
of six per cent ; in the fat of meat, a loss of seventeen 
per cent. Bacon furnishes an exception to this rule, as it 
ranks next to the fat of butter and cream. 

The nurse should be a student of the classification of 
foods, their fuel value and digestibility, thus being able 
to determine and regulate the needed rations for her 
patients. 

In feeding the sick, strict economy should be considered 
only when necessary. That which the patient really needs 
should be furnished always, if possible. Even in homes 
where the income is limited, there is a general self-denial 
for the one who is ill. It is a too-frequent error to over- 
indulge a patient, for it weakens rather than strengthens. 
From this fact, together with lack of knowledge and ap- 
pliance, those who are treated and cared for in a fine 
hospital are very apt to recover more quickly than those 
treated and cared for at home. 

In hospitals, where laige numbers are to be fed, many 
of whom are not able to contribute towards the support 
of the institution and still others who cannot pay their 
proportionate part, strict economy in food supplies be- 
comes imperative. Many cheap foods are equally nutri- 
tious to the more expensive ones, and if well cooked and 
served are gratifying to all the senses to which one wishes 
to appeal. 

In hospitals the dietaries are classified by the doctors, 
to assist the nurses in caring for their patients, as house, 
soft solid, soft diet, and liquid. 

1. House, including : — soups, meat, fish, eggs, cereals, 

vegetables, fruit, desserts, etc.

COOKERY FOB THE SICE. 47 



CHAPTER Vm. 
COOEEBY FOB THE SICE. 

COOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nourish- 
ment of the haman body. Cookery is the effect 
produced on food by the application of heat, air, and 
moisture. 

'' Uncivilized man takes his nourishment like animals, 
— as it is offered by nature ; civilized man prepares his 
food before eating, and in ways which are in general the 
more perfect the higher his culture. The art of cooking, 
when not allied with a degenerate taste or with gluttony, is 
one of the criteria of a people's civilization." There are 
comparatively few foods that are at their best when taken 
in the raw state ; they neither taste so good nor are they so 
easily digested as when subjected to some kind of cooking. 

Disease is oftentimes due to improper feeding. The food 
rations have not contained the correct proportions of the 
food principles, or the food stuffs have been improperly 
cooked. '^ Food well cooked is partially digested." 

Objects of cooking Food. 

1. To make more palatable. 

2. To develop flavor. 

8. To render more digestible. 

4. To destroy bacteria and parasites.

48 FOOD AND OOOKERT. 

The subjects of food and feeding now stand on a 
scientific basis, and more attention is being paid each 
year to the subject of cookery. While the fact is to be 
recc^nized that there are some born cooks, the large 
majority need teaching and training. Cookery should 
form a part of every woman's education, and is especially 
important for those who have the feeding of the present 
generation, both in health and in disease. 

For the best results in cookery, good materials, ac- 
curate measurements, care in combining ingredients, and 
a knowledge of the object, to be attained are essentials. 
In cooking, the effect of heat at different temperatures 
and the time of exposure of different foods to such tem- 
peratures must be thoroughly understood to reach the best 
nutritive and economic results. 

Measuring cups of gla^s, granite, or tin ware, divided 
into thirds or quarters, should be used. Tea and table 
spoons of regulation sizes, and also a case-knife, are 
indispensabl^s. To insure uniformly good results, level 
measurements have been adopted by the leading teachers 
of cookery, which seem at the present time the best guide 
that can be given to the average cook. Perhaps the time 
may come when measurement by weight will be practical, 
and then accuracy will be assured beyond a doubt.

Ways of comblziing Ingredients. 

1. Stirring. 

Employed to mix ingredients. 

A circular motion, widening the circles nntil all is 
blended. 

2. Beating. 

Employed to enclose air. 

A turning of ingredient or ingredients over and over, 
continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used to be brought 
constantly in contact with the bottom of the dish 
and throughout the mixture. 

3. Cutting and Folding. 

Employed to so mix ingredients that air already 
introduced may not escape. 

A repeated vertical downward motion with a spoon 
and a turning over and over of mixture, allowing 
bowl of spoon each time to come in contact with 
bottom of dish. These motions are alternated 
nntil thorough blending is accomplished.

care, while baking reqaires good Judgment, coupled with 
experience. In the many cook books, various oven tests 
are suggested, and oven thermometers have been placed 
upon the market, but all are of but little practical value, 
as one must gain this knowledge by her own experience. 

Vegetable foods abound in starch. Cold water sepa- 
rates starch grains ; boiling water causes them to swell 
and burst. 

Experiment 1. Mix two tablespoons flour with one- 
third cup cold water, and let stand five minutes. Flour 
settles to bottom of vessel. 

Experiment 2. Stir mixture and heat to boiling point. 
Starch grains swell and burst, making a paste. 

Dry heat, at a temperature of 820^ F., changes starch to 
dextrine, which is soluble in cold water. Examples: 
Crust of bread and baked potato. 

In cooking vegetables the object is to soften cellulose 
as well as swell and burst starch grains, and this is best 
accomplished by keeping the water at the boiling point 
throughout the entire cooking. By the proper cooking of 
starchy foods their digestibility is greatly increased. 

Albumen is the principal constituent of white of egg. 
It is dissolved in cold water, and coagulated by heat at a 
temperature of 134'' to 160'' F. 

Experim^rU 1, Put white of egg in cold water, stir, 
and albumen is dissolved. 

ExperiTtierU 2. Put white of egg in cold water, heat 
gradually to boiling point, and albamen coagulates. 

One of the proteids of meat is albumen, some of which 
is soluble in cold water and coagulated by heat

color. 

ExpenmenJt 2, Heat to boiling point and dissolved

thus preventing its escape.

In using meats for soap-making, the object is to draw 
oat as mach of the goodness as possible. This is accom- 
plished by patting the meat on in cold water, and allow- 
ing the water to heat gradaally to the boiling point, then 
simmering for several hoars, after wliich time the meat is 
deprived of its extractives, some mineral water, and sol- 
able albumen, though the greater part of its nutritive 
value is not extracted ; nevertheless, lacking flavor, it is 
hardly palatable for serving. In tiie making of stews, 
when meat and broth are both to be used, the meat should 
be put on in cold water, brought quickly to the boiling 
point, and then allowed to simmer until tender. 

Experiments have shown that where the water is allowed 
to boil vigorously during the entire cooking, the connective 
tissue has been gelatinized, while the fibres are hard and 
indigestible ; quite the reverse is true of the fibres where 
the meat is cooked for a longer time at a lower temper- 
ature, and the connective tissues are partially dissolved. 
In the latter case the economy of fuel is worthy of con- 
sideration. 

Cold water dissolves albumen, hot water coagulates it, 
as does intense heat. Meats, when broiled or roasted, are 
brought in direct contact with intense heat (coal, gas, 
or electricity furnishing the fuel), and turned frequently, 
thus searing the entire surface as quickly as possible. 
This method is applied to the more expensive cuts of 
meat. Meat, when baked in a hot oven, is commonly 
called roasted, as the old method of roasting before live 
coals has almost passed out of use. 

In cooking meats, when the object is to retain as much 
nutriment as possible, the surface should be subjected to 
a high temperature to quickly coagulate albuminous 
Juices. When cooked in water, the water must be at the 
boiling point to accomplish this, allowed to boil vigor- 
ously for five minutes, and then allowed to simmer for 
several hours. This method is applied to the cheaper 
oats of meat

MORE than two-thirds of the weight of the body 
oonsiBts of water. An adult requires five pints 
daily, and is furnished with this supply from the food he 
eats and the beverages he drinks. The outgo is even 
greater than the income, owing to the chemical changes 
which are constantly taking place in the body. 

Pure water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, there 
being two parts of hydrogen to one part of oxygen. The 
symbol of water is H^O. 

Water as found in nature is never chemically pure. It 
not only contains many mineral substances, but decaying 
animal and vegetable matter, and often pathogenic germs. 
From this statement it may be seen that a water supply 
cannot be too carefully guarded. 

The clear, colorless, tasteless fluid furnishes the average 
person with sufficient evidence of its purity ; while if lacking 
in any of these qualities he seems to be equally assured 
of its unfitness for consumption. These tests are entirely 
useless, and scientific investigations are the only saf^uards 
to a proper water supply. 

Filters, as used to render drinking water pure, are 
a delusion and a snare. The bed of a filter furnishes a 
desirable soil for the growth of bacteria, and while some 
of the larger organic particles are removed by filtration, 
the rapidity with which the micro-organisms increase 
render it less fit for use. 

Distilled water, prepared for medicinal purposes, is 
chemically pure. It is flat and insipid to the taste, having 
been deprived of its atmospheric gases. When used as a 



WATER. 58 

beverage it should be aSrated. Boiled water is freed from 
all organic impurities and salts of lime are precipitated. 

Water for household consumption is derived from five 
sources: — 

1. Bains. 

2. Bivers. 

8. Surface water and shallow wells. 

4. Deep Artesian wells. 

5. Springs. 

In many large towns and cities a system of reservoirs 
has been built, fed by springs and streams which have 
greatly improved water supplies. 

Where well water is used, especial attention should be 
given to the location of the well. It must be of sufficient 
distance from drains, cesspools, and barnyards to prevent 
contamination. 

Water drawn from large ponds, lakes, or rivers having 
a bottom of rock, day, or gravel, usually furnishes a safe 
supply. The law, nevertheless, requires frequent analyses 
— tiius helping, as far as possible, to make healthful 
conditions prevail. 

Water is frequently spoken of as hard or soft Hard 
water contains mineral matter to a greater extent than 
soft water, the amount varying from eight to seventy 
grains to the gallon. 

The hardness is due principally to salts of lime and 
magnesia. Soft water is free from an excess of these 
salts, containing but three to four grains to the gallon. 
Water is the greatest known solvent, and the softer the 
water the greater its solvent power.

XTses In the Body. 

1. To quench thirst 

2. To nourish. 

8. To regulate body temperature. 

4. To assist in carrying off waste products. 

5. To maintain the proper degree of dilution for all the 

fluids of the body. 

6. To stimulate the nervous system and various organs. 

7. To form a part of all cell life, as metabolism cannot 

go on without it. 

Water taken in moderation with meals if not over 
chilled dilutes the food so it is more easily absorbed. 

Cold water to a small extent retards gastric digestion, 
but increases peristalsis. If a glassful is taken before 
breakfast and upon retiring, it often cures constipation. 

Tepid water is successfully used as an emetic, 90^ F. 
being the temperature at which it is administered. 

Hot water acts as a stimulant to gastric digestion. It 
leaves the stomach more quickly and is more quickly 
absorbed than cold water. Hot water relieves thirst better 
than cold water. It will also relieve nausea, — a small 
quantity of crushed ice having the same effect. 

Water has many uses of valuable importance to man 
which ought to be mentioned; namely, for transpor- 
tation, manufacturing purposes, and the generation of 
electrical power; but the purpose of this work is to 
consider it as a cleanser, an antiseptic, and a source of 
infection. The relation which bathing bears to health 
need hardly be emphasized, as it has for so long a time been 
duly recognized. Frequent bathing keeps the pores of the 
skin open, thus enabling much waste matter to be elim- 
inated. Water is a carrier of disease germs, and too 
frequent are the cases of typhoid fever caused by drinking

water. The only sure way of destaroying pathogenic germs 
in water is by boiling the same. Boiled water is a valuable 
antiseptic, and will not ferment. 

There are many charged^ carbonated, and mineral spring 
waters bottled and pat upon the market Some are used 
as table beverages, others for medicinal purposes. They 
stimulate the flow of gastric Juice. 

Ordinary water, artificially charged with carbon di- 
oxid (COs), is called soda water, and may be purchased by 
the glass, usually in combination with fruit syrups or in 
syphons. Such water, when sold at the druggist's, contains 
a larger per cent of COs than carbonated (naturally charged) 
waters, which renders it cooler to the taste, as the gas in 
passing off withdraws heat 

Plain soda water, taken in moderation, assists gastric 
digestion. It is a bad practice to indulge too freely in 
soda water with fruit syrups, as it causes a tendency to 
flatulency and indigestion. Almost all so-called fruit 
syrups are chemically prepared in the laboratory. 

Among the most common carbonated table waters may 
be mentioned, Poland (uneffervescing), and Vichy, Johan- 
nis, Apollinaris, and Seltzer (effervescing). These often 
tempt people to drink who would otherwise neglect to do 
so, and in cases of fever they may be freely given. They 
are useful to dilute alcoholic liquors, and they are quite 
apt to relieve nausea and vomiting. 

The alkaline mineral waters are all carbonated. Their 
most important ingredient is alkaline carbonates, and so- 
dium chloride, sometimes sodium sulphates being present 
Examples: Saratoga, Vichy, White Sulphur Spring, 
Hot Sulphur Spring, HunyadU, and Londonderry Lithia 
Waters. Lithia water is often recommended in cases of 
rheumatism or gout; Hunyadi for liver troubles and in- 
discretions in diet 

Where patients are advised by physicians to visit water 
cures the good results obtained are due as much to change, 
rest, treatment, and quantity of water ingested, as to any 
especial value that the water itself contains.

CHAPTER X. 



MILK is an ideal food. This statement is plainly 
demonstrated by the fact that it furnishes the 
nourishment for the young of all mammalia during the 
period of their most rapid growth. While its value must 
not be overestimated in the dietary of the healthy adult^ 
it is a matter of fact that in many countries the inhabit- 
ants live for the most part on it This is true of the 
peasants of Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, the Bed- 
ouins of Arabia, and the peoples dwelling in the moun- 
tain regions of Asia and on the pasture lands of the 
Sahara. It would be necessary for the man at work in 
the United States to consume four quarts daily in order 
to get the necessary quantity of protein, and by so doing 
he would be furnished with an excess of fat and a limited 
supply of carbohydrates. No one food can meet all the 
requirements of tiie body except during infancy. 

Milk should be regarded as a food rather than as a bev- 
erage. While it is a liquid outside the body, as soon as it 
enters the stomach it is made solid by the action of rennin, 
which causes it to become clotted. Milk is of most value 
in a mixed dietary, when taken between meals with a 
cracker or piece of bread, and it should be sipped rather 
than drunk. If taken quickly in large quantities, so dense 
a curd is formed in the stomach that it is with difficulty 
that the gastric juice acts upon it. As has been stated, 
each food calls forth a special kind of gastric Juice, and in 
the case of milk it is in moderate supply and of moderate 
strength. Children absorb ninety-six per cent of the total 
solids of milk, while adults absorb eighty-nine per cent. 
With the i^ed, as digestion becomes impaired, milk should 
hold a prominent place in tiie daily dietary.

Many milk analyses have shown that the nntritive oon- 
stitaents of milk vary to a considerable degree, this even 
holding tme of the milk from a single cow at different 
milkings, the greatest difference being in the quantity 
of fat Jersey and Guernsey breeds yield the largest quan- 
tity of fat, but a smaller supply of milk. The largest 
amount of fat is obtained in the morning's milking. 

The quality and quantity of milk is not only determined 
by the breed, but by the age, health, housing, feeding, 
care, and time of lactation of the animal from which it 
comes. It is an absolute necessity that the milk supply 
be carefully inspected, and in aU large cities chemists are 
employed for this purpose, whose work has been of the 
greatest value. 

Milk is more quickly contaminated than any other food 
product

MUk, as soon as it comes from the animal, should bo 
put in sterile vessels, cooled as quickly as possible, 
covered, and kept at a low temperature. 

In the hands of the consumer it always contains a large 
number of micro-organisms, the greater number of which 
tend to increase lactic fermentation, which causes souring. 
If milk is kept under favorable conditions and for not too 
long a time, these do not sufficiently multiply to cause 
anxiety. 



58 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

The pathogenic germs in milk are often caases of 
typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, tabercnlosls^ and 
cholera. They are killed at 167*^ F., a mach lower tem- 
perature than the micro-organisms which produce souring, 
and they also occur in smaller numbers. 

When in doubt of the milk supply, it is always best to 
scald it 

If milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the fat rises 
to the surface in the form of cream ; this is due to its 
lower specific gravity. Such cream is called gravity 
cream. When a separator is used for removing cream, 
the cream thus obtained is called centrifugal cream. It 
must not be inferred from this that cream contains 
nothing but f at^ for it holds relatively as large a propor- 
tion of sugar and proteid as milk itself, the deficiency 
being in the proportion of water. Cream is an expensive 
form of fat, and must be regarded as a luxury. 

Lactose (sugar of milk) is equal in nutritive value to 
cane sugar. It has some advantages over cane sugar, for 
under ordinary conditions it does not ferment, it is not so 
quickly absorbed, and it is a diuretic. Lactose is not so 
sweet to the taste as cane sugar, which renders it of value 
in the sick-room ; it is, however, an expensive fuel food. 

The protein of milk is the cheapest form in which 
animal proteid may be obtained. It consists principally 
of casein, albumen to a smaller extent, some globulin, and 
traces of peptone. 

Potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulphur, 
phosphorus, and chlorine are all found in the ash of 
milk in the form of oxides, chlorides, or acids. 

81dm BffUk. 

Milk from which most of the fat has been removed is 
known as skim milk. The quantity of fat removed de- 
pends on the manner in which the work is accomplished. 
Separator skimmed milk has less fat than that from deep 
cold setting. Skim milk has more protein than whole 
milk, and a slightiy lai^er proportion of milk sugar. 



louL 69 

Skim milk may be adyantageooBly ased by the poorer 
classeB. Its deficiency in fat may be made up, easily, by 
obtaining it from cheaper sources than whole milk. 

BfEttemilllE. 

Buttermilk is obtained from cream during its manu- 
facture into butter. Its composition differs but little 
from that of skim milk. It contains less proteid and 
sugar and more fat. 

It has a slightly acid taste, which makes it an agree- 
able beyerage, and it is well borne by people of weak 
digestioa 

It acts as a laxative. 

Whey. 

When milk is clotted by the action of rennet^ wine, or 
an acid, and after standing a few minutes is strained 
through a double thickness of cheese cloth, the liquid 
obtained is known as whey. It is a slightly laxative 
fluid of small nutritive value. 

Koumiss, Kefir, and Matsoon. 

Koumiss, originally fermented mare's milk, was first 
made, hundreds of years ago, in the steppes of Bussia 
and Southwestern Asia. A double fermentation takes 
place in its manufacture, — lactic and alcoholic. Lactic 
fermentation b^ns first, while alcoholic lasts longer. It 
is the purpose of the Koumiss maker to hinder lactic 
fermentation as far as possible. Koumiss is made in the 
United States from cow's milk, yeast being the ferment 
used. 

The alcohol (CAOH) and carbon dioxid (CO,) formed 
during fermentation render the milk more easily digested 
and absorbed than in its natural state. It is consequently 
of great value in the sick-room, and is the one form in 
which milk seldom fails to be retained by the patient 

Kefir and Matzoon are fermented cow's mUk, varying 
but little in composition from Koumiss. Koumiss and

▲dolteration. 

The adulteration of milk is far less frequent than for- 
merly, as inspection, under law, is liable to take place at 
any time. 

Where adulteration takes place it is accomplished, most 
commonly, by the removal of some of the cream or the 
addition of water. Salt, sugar, chalk, and starch are less 
often employed as adulterants. Annatto, caramel, or ani- 
line dyes are used for coloring, that the product may look 
as though it were of the best quality. 

Milk sours so quickly during warm weather that preser- 
vatives have often been resorted to to overcome this 
bacterial action. Among these have been found borax, 
borftcic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, potassium chro- 
mate, and carbonate of soda. 

While these adulterants and preservatives are not 
poisonous when taken in the milk for an indefinite period, 
they are deleterious to health. 

Massachusetts authorities prohibit the sale of '' not of 
standard quality" milk as well as of adulterated milk; 
while other states have equally stringent laws. The fol- 
lowing statute defines standard milk : — 

** If the milk is shown upon analysis to contain less 
than thirteen per cent of milk solids, or to contain less 
than nine aud three-tenths per cent of milk solids exclu- 
sive of fat, it shall be deemed for the purposes of this act 



MILK. 61 

to be not of good Btandard quality except during the 
months of April, May, Jane, July, and August, when milk 
containing less than twelve per cent of milk solids, or 
less than nine per cent of milk solids exclusive of fat, or 
less than three per cent of f at^ shall be deemed to be not 
of good standard quality.'' 

BffeotB of Cooking. 

When milk is heated a scum rises to the top, which con- 
sists of coagulated albumen, a small quantity of coagulated 
casein, and some fat. If the scum is removed some of 
the nutritive value of the milk is lost. If scalded milk 
is beaten with an egg-beater the scum, which is so un- 
sightly, is well intermingled with the mass. 

Milk should always be heated in a double boiler, where 
it never reaches a higher temperature than 196^ F. If 
heated in a single utensil, it may reach the boiling point 
(214^ F.), when it is liable to boil over or to bum, and it 
always takes an unnecessarily long time to wash and 
scour the dish. 

The taste of milk is altered by the application of heat. 
The flavor of cooked milk is not so agreeable to the taste 
as uncooked milk. For this reason, if cooked milk is to 
be taken alone, it should be chilled as quickly as possible, 
which somewhat overcomes the change of taste. 

DigastibiUly. 

Milk is easy of digestion and absorption. When com- 
paring the digestibility of raw with cooked milk experi- 
ments have shown such different results that one cares to 
be guarded in making statements. The clots formed by 
cooked milk are smaller and less dense than those formed 
by raw milk ; notwithstanding this fact, it is a prevalent 
belief that the casein is not so readily absorbed nor the 
fat so completely assimilated.

2. Improying digestibflity. 

By skimming, scalding, diluting with charged waters 
or farinaceous gruels, or by adding alkalines or 
adds. Addition of salt prevents biliousness. 

Bicarbonate of soda prevents mal-fermentation. By 
the addition of farinaceous gruels milk forms in 
less dense dots. 

By scalding, lactic acid fermentation is restricted. 
Hot milk soothes mucous membrane, allays a 
slight throat irritation, increases peristalsis, and 
tends to produce sleep. 

3. Predigesting. 

By adding Fairchild's Pancreatin or Pepsin powder, 
which changes the proteids to albumoses, and if the 
process is continued long enough, to peptones. If 
converted to peptones there will be a bitter taste. 

Predigested milk is used in extreme cases to bridge 
the patient over a critical period, and for forced 
feeding in many hospitals and by many physicians. 

According to the best authorities, however, predi- 
gested milk has no advantage over ordinary milk. 
From the fact that the proteins are partially 
digested, it would seem that a large amount of 
nutriment could be given in predigested milk ; if, 
however, it is administered in sufficient quantities 
to supply a large amount of nutriment, one of two 
symptoms usuaUy appear, — diarrhoea or nausea.

food, as it is so completely oxidized in the body, only ten 
per cent passing out of the system. The question of its 
use is a moral one, and in health it is entirely unneces-

the most harmful, for they contain a considerable quantity 
of fnael-oil, — a poisonous natural product difficult to 
eliminate. This diminishes with age, when they mellow 
and improve in flavor. 

Alcohol is used in the sick-room for bathing purposes, 
and is usually diluted with water. Its local effect is that 
of an irritant. 

Alcoholic beverages produce : — 

1. Cheer and good fellowship. 

2. Excitement and buoyancy. 

8. Loss of self-control and judgment 

4. Loss of control of muscular movements. 

5. Stupor. 

6. Depression. 

The physiological effects of alcohol are as yet incom- 
pletely understood. Its effect on the respiratory system 
is very slight, and on the circulatory system very doubtful ; 
but it is given for the purpose of stimulating heart action. 
If given in small quantities it assists gastric digestion ; in 
moderate quantities, it retards the flow of gastric Juice ; 
and in large quantities albumen is precipitated. Its effect 
on metabolism is that of partially paralyzing the cells, 
thus causing them to lose some of their power to break 
down proteids, carbohydrates, and fats. 

Effects produced by the habitual use of alcoholic 
beverages : — 

1. Throat becomes husky. 

1. Chronic gastric catarrh.

might disturb digestion. They are preferably giVen 
before or at the time of meals. When taken between 
meals they should be accompanied by a biscuit or

The use of alcoholic beverages in some diseases seems 
almost imperative. Lives, without doubt, have been saved 
by the use of champagne. In fevers it is often given to 
produce depression, which results in sleep. In this way 
much strength is saved for the critical crisis. Brandy 
and red wines are given in cases of diarrhoaa on account 
of the tannic acid they contain, which acts as an astringent. 
Erysipelas seems to be one of the diseases which calls for 
large quantities of alcohol. From eighteen to twenty 
ounces of brandy or whiskey may be administered daOy 
without producing any intoxicating effects. Diabetes also 
demands the use of alcoholic stimulants. Brandy is the 
liquor generally preferred, as it assists in the digestion of 
fats. Pneumonia in feeble or elderly subjects calls for 
alcoholic stimulants ; while in cases of diphtheria patients 
are often saved by their early and energetic use. 

Many malt extracts and malted foods have been placed 
upon the market, some of which contain a minimum 
quantity of alcohol ; but they are principally valuable for 
the diastase they contain, which aids in the digestion of 
carbohydrates. 



ALCOHOL. 67 

The value of the patent spring medicines nsnally lies 
In the alcohol which they contain. Their stimolating 
effects lead many to belieye that they are receiving 
permanent help rather than a temporary support By 
analysis many have been found to contain as much alcohol 
as is present in sherry wine ; while in others the per cent 
is greatly in advance. Would it not be wise to consult 
a physician rather than experiment along lines where 
danger is so imminent?

CHAPTER Xn. 
BEVSRAOBS. 

A BEVERAGE is any drink. Water, the chief one of 
them all, is Nature's beverage. Almost all of the 
beverages have bat little nutritive value (exception must 
be made, however, to egg-nogs, cocoa, chocolate, etc.) ; 
nevertheless their use in health as well as in disease 
should be carefully considered. When abstinence from 
solid or semi-solid food is necessary for a short time, a 
liquid diet must furnish the nourishment 

Starchy beverages include toast, rice, and barley water. 
Rice and barley water are given to reduce a laxative con- 
dition of the bowels, and are often used alternately. Rice 
water is soothing to the whole alimentary canal. Toast 
water is given in extreme cases of nausea. 

Fruit beverages are cooling, refreshing, slightly stimu- 
lating, and are valuable for the salts, acids, and sugar 
they contain. They are frequently employed when high 
temperature is present Lemons and oranges are most 
used in the making of fruit beverages on account of their 
cheapness and popularity. Raspberries, strawberries, 
pineapples, currants, grapes, and tamarinds are used less 
frequently. As all fruits contain one or more acids, a 
physician should be consulted as to the kind to be given 
in individual cases. Pineapple contains a ferment which 
digests proteids. 

Wine whey is slightly stimulating, and is often retained 
in severe gastric troubles. For a limited period it may 
be used successfully for debilitated infants with wei^ 
digestion. It stimulates the digestive ferments to such 
an extent that there may be a gradual return to a regular 



BEVERAGES. 69 

diet. Clam water and oyster liquor sometimes stimiilate 
the appetite. Clam water, administered in small quanti- 
ties, is especially valuable in relieving extreme cases of ^ 
nausea ; in larger quantities it acts as a laxative. 

Egg-nogs, and other beverages in which eggs are used, 
play a most important part in the dietary of the sick, for 
by their use nutriment in a concentrated form is easily 

administered. 

Tea. 

The leaves of the evei^een shrub, Thea, furnish the 
tea of commerce, both black and green. 

The best brands of black tea are imported from India 
and Ceylon ; the best green tea comes from Japan, and a 
small quantity from China. Tea leaves before curing 
have neither odor nor flavor. 

There are four gatherings annually. The first picking 
comes in April, and is considered the best. 

Climate, elevation, soil, cultivation, selection of the 
leaves, and the care in the picking and curing of them, 
all go to make up the difference in quality. First qual- 
ity tea is made from the young, tender, whole leaves. In 
black tea the leaves are allowed to ferment, while in 
green tea the leaves are unfermented. 

Tea is a stimulant rather than a nutrient. Its stimu- 
lating effect is due to the alkaloid thein and a volatile oil. 
Its astringency is due to tannin. Black tea contains less 
tannin than green tea, while the thein and oil vary but 
Uttle. 

Tea should always be made as an infusion, by the use 
of freshly boiled water, with but one infusion to each 
measure of tea. The practice of allowing tea to boil, or 
allowing leaves to be used and reused with a small 
additional supply, cannot be too strongly condemned. 
The thein is so soluble that it is almost immediately dis- 
solved out of the leaf. Tannic acid is developed as 
soon as tea is placed in boiling water, but in a small 
quantity. Experiments have shown that more tannic 
acid is developed in a five-minute than in a three-minute 



70 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

infiiBioD, and the longer it stands, the more tannic acid is 
drawn out 

Tea drinkers require less food than those not addicted 
to its use, as it has been proved that there is less wear 
to the tissues when it is frequently indulged in. This 
accounts for the large quantity drunk by the poor. It 
would appear from its immediate stimulating and satisfy- 
ing effects that it had a food value ; but when it is con- 
stantly used to take the place of food, sooner or later 
evil effects are apparent, and the victim, if attacked by 
disease, finds that the system offers little resistance. 
The harmful effects are due, principally, to the tannic 
acid and oil, as thein stimulates rather than retards gas- 
tric digestion. 

Tea is stimulating, refreshing, and often relieves bodily 
fatigue and headache. It has a slight influence in regu- 
lating circulation and temperature. It is one of the 
most cooling drinks in summer and warming drinks in 
winter. On an empty stomach it acts as a diuretia 
Excessive tea drinkers are apt to become nervous, to 
suffer from insomnia and mental depression. The habit 
must be closely guarded, for the habitual, excessive tea 
drinker often becomes a nervous wreck. 

To the aged it is '' The cup that cheers.'' It certainly 
proves a useful stimulant as the functional activities of 
the stomach become weakened. It never should be given 
to children, and would better be avoided by the young. 

Cofiee. 

Coffee is the seed of the berry of the evergreen tree 
Caffoea Arabica, which yields, annually, three harvests. 
Each berry contains two seeds enclosed in a husk. Ex- 
ception must be made to the male berry, which contains 
but one seed. 

Coffee was formerly cured by being dried in the sun, 
but owing to the warm climate and frequent rainfalls in 
the countries in which it is grown, slow artificial heat is 
preferable, and is imported to be cleaned, sized, roasted.

and gronnd. The coffee berry in its raw state has no 
odor or flavor, both being developed by roasting. 

For its cultivation it requires a warm climate, rich soil, 
and protection from wind and storms. 

Java coffee is the finest coffee grown, but mach sold 
under that name does not come, necessarily, from the 
island of Java. Any coffee having the distinctive flavor 
of Java coffee, no matter where grown, bears the name. 
Maleberry Java commands a higher price than any other 
coffee on the market. Brazil, Central America, Mexico, 
and Arabia are all coffee countries. 

Coffee, like tea, is usually blended, the most popular 
mixture being three or four parts Java to one part Mocha. 
The Mocha gives a certain sparkle and acidity which the 
general public demands. 

Coffee, like tea, is a stimulant. Its stimulating effect is 
due to caffein and a volatile oil. The effect of caffein is 
nearly identical with that of thein. Coffee also contains 
tannin. As taken for a beverage it is more stimulating 
than tea, from the fact that*so much more is used. Its 
food value lies in the sugar and cream served with it. 

Coffee should be bought in small quantities and kept 
tightly covered in a glass jar or tin canister. It should 
not be ground until purchased, and when convenient, it is 
best ground at home. On account of the large quantity 
of volatile oil it contains, it quickly depreciates in value. 

Coffee may be prepared as a decoction (boiled coffee), 
filtration, or infusion. Coffee for filtering should be finely 
ground. 

Coffee strengthens heart action, increases respiration, 
and excites mucous membrane. It is a nerve stimulant 
and a diuretic. It removes the sensation of fatigue, for 
which reason it is used by many nurses when on night 
duty. It is often valuable to relieve nausea after an 
ansesthetic, and often proves useful in cases of opium and 
alcoholic poisoning. 

A cup of black coffee assists digestion, while a cup of 
breakfast coffee, as ordinarily served, retards digestion,

bat not to as great an extent as tea. When there is a 
flatulent state^of the stomach, tea increases the amount of 
gas, in which case coflfee is to be preferred. When taken 
in excess coffee produces biliousness, languor, restless- 
ness, heartburn, palpitation of the heart, tremor, dyspep- 
sia, and insomnia. 

Many preparations have been put upon the market as 
coffee substitutes, but to the coffee drinker there is no 
substitute. They, however, make a pleasing hot bever- 
age, and when properly made and served with sugar and 
cream, they have a food value. To the adult a single cup 
of coffee at breakfast and a single oup of tea at luncheon 
seldom prove harmful, and are acceptable to the average 
person. 

Cocoa and Ghocolata. 

Cocoa and chooolate are manufactured from the cacao 
bean of commerce. This bean, a native of Mexico, is the 
seed of a fruit from six to ten inches in length, containing 
from twenty to thirty seeds. The area of the cocoa belt 
for remunerative crops is limited, being chiefly confined to 
Mexico, South America, and the West Indies. The fruit 
matures throughout the year, taking four months for 
ripening; but the principal harvest is in the spring. 

The fruit is gathered and allowed to remain in a heap 
on the ground for twenty-four hours, the pods are then 
cut open and the seeds removed, drained, and put in a 
sweating-box for two days to undergo the process of 
fermentation. The flavor of the bean depends largely 
upon the care taken during this process. Now the beans 
are dried in the sun, after which tiiey are ready for 
exportation* 

Having been exported in this crude state, they must be 
cleaned, assorted, and roasted ; then the thin, brittle cov- 
erings removed by machinery. The thin coverings are 
sold under the name of cocoa sheUs. The broken roasted 
beans constitute cocoa nibs. Chocolate is the cocoa nibs 
crashed, pulverized, and moulded- Vanilla and sweet 



BEV1SBAGE& 78 

chocolates have fhe addition of sngar and flavoring. In 
the mannf actare of cocoas nearly one-half of the fat is 
removed from cocoa nibs. 

Unlike tea and coffee, cocoa and chocolate, though 
slightly stimolating, have a food value which should not 
be overlooked.

The stimulating effect of cocoa is due to theobromine, 
a principle closely allied to thein and caffein; it also 
contains some tannin. 

Cocoa as a beverage may be used by many with whpm 
tea and coffee disagree. There are some, however, who 
find it clogging and heavy on account of the large quan- 
tity of fat it contains. This is usually attributable to 
the fact that it is taken with a hearty meal. In cases 
of enfeebled digestion, cocoa usually agrees with the 
patient better than tea or coffee.

GBUSI^ BEEF EXTRACTS, AND BEEF TEAS. 89 



CHAPTER Xm. 
GRUELS, BEEF EXTRACTS, AND BEEF TEAS. 

GRUELS are cooked mixtares of cereal products and 
water, or milk and water. In preparing gruels the 
rules for the cooking of all starchy foods should be 
observed. Milk or cream, when used in the making of a 
gruel, should be added just before serving, as milk sub- 
jected to a high temperature for a long time is rendered 
more difficult of digestion. Most patients object to 
sweetened gruels, therefore avoid the use of sugar in their 
preparation. In exceptional cases, where it is called 
for, it may be used sparingly. Gruel should be well 
seasoned, served hot, and of such a consistency as to be 
taken through a syphon. 

Among gruels, Indian and oat meal take first rank as 
regards nutritive value. They are heat-producing and 
slightly laxative. Oatmeal gruel is frequently taken by 
nursing women to increase the milk supply. It is some- 
what more nutritious than an equal quantity of mQk; 
besides, it has the advantage of offering variety to the 
diet in the form of liquid food. Indian meal gruel is 
often enjoyed by the aged and the consumptive. Barley 
gruel acts as an astringent ; as do Thickened MUk and 
Cracker Gruel. 

Many preparations are on the market to use in the 
making of gruels, composed largely of dextrinized starch, 
malted barley, or evaporated milk. They have largely 
taken the place of the old-fashioned gruels, for, having 
been previously cooked, but a short time is required for 
their preparation. When malt is introduced it assists in 
the digestion of starch. When economy is considered, 
their use should be avoided, as they are expensive. 



90 FOOD AND OOOKEBT. 

Beef extract is the expressed Joioes of beef. Beef tea 
is the expressed Juices of beef dilated with water. Both 
are composed of water, fat, mineral matter^ albnminoiis 
Jaioes, and extraotiTes (which give color and flavor). 
Extractives include creatin, creatinin, and allied com- 
pounds (sometimes called meat bases), which closely re- 
semble the thein in tea and the caifein in coffee and have 
a simQar effect upon the nervous system. It is to these 
compounds that the value of beef extract and beef tea is 
largely attributable. While they contain a small amount 
of soluble albumen, the food value is so slight, they must 
be considered as stimulants rather than nutrients. 

Beef tea may be used to advantage. 

1. To give variety to a liquid diet. 

2. When much water is to be ingested 

8. On account of the warmth that it gives. 

4. In cases of weakened digestion. 
It stimulates appetite. 
Meat extractives are the greatest known stimulants 
to gastric Juice. 

Beef extract, being concentrated, may be retained 
often, if taken in small quantities at frequent intervals, 
where beef tea could not be borne; on the other hand, 
beef tea may be taken in larger quantities with satisfying 
effects, where beef extract would prove insufficient. 

Many preparations made from beef are on the market 
in the form of liquids, powders, meals, or pastes. To 
some of these a considerable amount of fat is added, 
which increases their nutritive value ; still others are use- 
ful only for the flavor and color they impart, and would 
find better place in the kitchen to be used in the making 
of soups and sauces than in the sick-room. 

Home-made beef tea, if carefully prepared, is usually 
liked better by a patient, costs much less, and, as a rule, 
is more nutritiouB than the manufactured article. It wUl 
keep without decomposition, however, but a short time. 

Physicians frequently order the preparations on the 
market, to give variety, and to try, if possible, to please 



GBUELB, BKEF HXTRAOTB, AND BKBF TEAS. 91 

the patient. Again, if home-made beef tea is ordered he 
is in doabt as to the way in which it will be made, while 
the mannf aotured product is uniformly constant. 

It is neyer safe to resort to beef tea as the principal 
article of diet for more than a few days, as it would 
mean slow starvation to the patient. Milk, egg, cracker, 
or bread is added, frequently, to beef extract or beef tea 
to increase their food value. 

Beef, for the making of beef extract and beef tea, 
should be cut from the upper or lower part of the round 
of a heavy corn-fed steer. This insures good flavor and 
a large quantity of juice. One-half pound of such beef 
will yield two ounces (four tablespoons) of juice, making 
the price about five cents per ounce. The juice from the 
lower part of the round is quite as satisfactory and less 
expensive than that from the upper part 

Beef extract may be served in a colored glass or small 
china cup. In this way the color, which is objectionable 
to many, may be concealed.

CHAPTER XIV. 
BBEAD. 

BREAD may be called, withoat error of statement^ 
^* the staff of life," inasmach as it is used by all 
civilized peoples as their staple article of food, and f ar- 
nishes proteid, carbohydrate, mineral matter, and a small 
quantity of fat. The deficiency in fat is usually supplied 
by spreading bread with butter. 
Breads may be considered under two great classes : — 

U Fermented, 

Made light by the use of a ferment, yeast usually 
being employed. 
% Unfermented, 

Made light by the use of soda and cream of tartar, 
or baking powder. 

In either case the lightness is due to the development 
of carbon diozid (COs). In the first instance this change 
is brought about during the process of fermentation. 
There are various kinds of fermentation, each of which is 
caused by special organisms. The organisms found in 
the yeast plant are the ones which apply to bread making. 
They have the power of changing starch to sugar, and 
sugar to alcohol and V^arbon dioxid. In the second case 
the change is brought about by chemical reaction. By 
the action of moisture and heat, the gas in the bicarbonate 
of soda is liberated by the acid in the cream of tartar. 

The necessary ingredients for a loaf of bread are flour, 
water, and yeast To these may be added shortening, 
salt, sugar, and milk. 

Bread made with water, flour, salt, and yeast keeps 
fresh longer, and is less liable to sour, than when mUk is 
used for the wetting, but is of a tougher consistency, and 



BREAD. 97 

not as palatable. When shortening is added with either 
milk or water the bread is tenderer and better tasting. 
The addition of a little sugar — one tablespoon to six 
cups of floor — hastens the rising, and has no appreci- 
able effect on the taste. The United States Department of 
Agriculture, Fanner's Bulletin 112, recommends the use 
of milk for bread making, as it adds to the proteid as well 
as the fuel value of the loaf. 

Hard spring wheat flour is the best adapted to bread 
making, as it contains gluten in the light proportion to 
produce the spongy loaf. Gluten is the chief proteid of 
wheat Its elastic, tenacious qualities, when mixed with 
water and acted upon by yeast, allow the gas formed to 
expand without danger of escape, making light the entire 
mass. The strength of a flour is determined largely by 
the quantity of gluten it contains. The larger the quantity 
of gluten, the more water it will take up, and the greater 
the yield in number of loaves to the barrel. 

Entire wheat, Graham, and white flour are all products 
of wheat Entire wheat flour may be bought either flne 
or coarse. Graham flour is a dark flour product contain- 
ing a perceptible quantity of the coarse inner bran coats 
of the wheat 

Rye flour ranks next to wheat flour for bread making 
purposes. It is of darker color, and its gluten is less 
elastic and tenacious. In making rye bread it is desirable 
to use white flour in combination with rye flour. 

Oats and barley are seldom used in the making of 
bread. Their gluten is even less tenacious than that of 
rye. From com meal it is impossible to make a raised 
loaf, for none of its proteid is in the form of gluten.

From this table it may be seen that there k no appre- 
ciable difference between the fuel valae of bread, whether 
made from white or entire wheat flonr. Bread made from 
Graham floor contains so much of the bran coats of the 
wheat that it is forced tiiroogh the digestive tract so 
quickly that absorption is less complete, and the system 
gets less nutritive value from it than from bther breads. 
Nevertheless; there are times when its use is to be rec- 
ommended. If the intestines do their work slowly and 
inoompletelyy it acts as a stimulus to peristalsis. 

Taast. 

Teast is a minute single-celled plant of fungus growth 
which reproduces itself in two ways : — 

1. By sending out buds which break off as new plants. 

2. By forming spores which develop into new plants^ 

under favorable conditions. 

Conditions most favorable for its growth : — 

1. Warmth (78^ P.). 

2. Moisture. 

8. Sugar or starch converted into si^ar. 

4. Nitrogenous soil. 

5. Oxygen. 

The most favorable temperature for the growth of the 
yeast plant is 78^ F. Yeast is killed at a moist heat of 
140" F. or a dry heat of 212*" F. Teast will survive freez- 
ing temperature (82° F.), and if again placed under favor- 
able conditions will grow and thrive. 

While the yeast plant is active when well furnished with 
air, it is capable of obtaining a supply of oxygen by split- 
ting up sugar and starch. 

In bread making the side products of fermentation are 
almost as important as the carbon dioxid and alcohol, as 
they give flavor and aroma to the products. 

Wild yeast plants are found floating in the air, and it 
is by the cultivation of these that pure yeast cultures are 



BBKAD. 99 

obtainecL Standard brands of compressed yeast cakes 
are most satisfactory for bread making and are almost 
nniyersally used. They contain a larger number of yeast 
plants to a given bulk than any other form of yeast, either 
liquid or dry. 

Yeast cakes should be used only when fresh, and while 
they keep fresh but a few days, there is seldon difficulty 
in obtaining a satisfactory supply. A fresh yeast cake is 
known by its light color, and absence from dark streaks. 

Bread BCakin^. 

Fermented bread is made by mixing to a dough flour, 
with a liquid (water, nulk, or milk and water), salt, 
and a ferment (yeast), sugar being usually added to 
hasten fermentation. The dough is then kneaded until 
smooth, elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be seen on 
the surface, to thoroughly mix the ingredients, to distri- 
bute uniformly the yeast, and to incorporate air; then 
covered for rising, and allowed to remain at a temperature 
of 69'' to Td"" F. until it doubles its bulk. During this 
time the yeast has produced a ferment which changes 
some of the starch to sugar, and the sugar in turn 
to alcohol and carbon dioxid. Still another ferment 
appears which peptonizes some of the gluten of the 
wheat. 

It is then cut down, and again kneaded, to break 
bubbles and distribute evenly the gas already formed. 
If allowed to rise too long the result will be a sour bread. 
If it is not convenient to shape the dough when it has 
doubled its bulk, it may be cut down, thus checking fer- 
mentation for the time being, then set in a cool place to 
let rise again. This may be done without injury to the 
flmshed loaf; in fact many consider the second rising an 
improvement Sour bread shows either lack of the knowl- 
edge of bread making or carelessness. 

Where bread is mixed in the morning, when one is able 
to keep a watch on it during the entire rising, a uniform 



100 FOOD AND OOOKERT. 

temperatare is best accomplished by placing bowl con- 
taining dough in a larger vessel of water kept at a tem- 
perature of 100° F. 

After the yeast has done its work (which is accom- 
plished when a certain amount of alcohol is produced) 
bacterial action begins, which gives rise to acetic, lactic, 
and butyric fermentation, which are the causes of sour 
bread. These micro-organisms may enter the mixture 
through the flour, water, or air, and a few are present in 
the yeast cake. Salt retards the action of bacteria. 

Quick rising, or five-hour bread, requires a larger quan- 
tity of yeast cake than bread which is allowed to rise 
over night, but is generally more satisfactory. There 
are, however, some who prefer the flavor obtained by the 
long rising. In the following recipes five-hour bread only 
will be considered. These recipes may be used where 
bread is allowed to rise over night if one-fourth yeast 
cake is allowed to each pint of liquid. 

A sponge is a mixture of liquid, flour, and yeast cake of 
such a consistency to pour or drop from a spoon. Many 
in making bread prefer first making a sponge, allowing 
that to rise until lights and then adding flour to knead. 

Shaping Bread Douglui. 

Bread dough, properly risen, is ready for shaping into 
loaves, biscuits, or rolls. Cut off dough the desired size, 
knead until smooth, avoiding seams underneath, place in 
buttered pan, cover, again let rise to double its bulk, when 
it is ready for baking. 

Biscuits or rolls may be shaped in a great variety of 
ways but always see to it that they are made small. Hot 
fresh raised bread is not a suitable article of diet for the 
sick and convalescent 

Sometimes stale biscuits or rolls, reheated, may be used, 
and twice baked bread, in the form of pulled bread and 
Zwieback, is especially recommended. 



BREAD. 101 

Baking of Bread. 

Bread is baked 

1. To kill the yeast plant (accomplished at Ids'* F.). 

2. To render the starch soluble. 

3. To drive off alcohol and carbon dioxid. 

4. To form a dextrinized crust of sweet, pleasant flavor. 
It is a common error to bake loaf bread insufficiently. 

While it requires a hot oven, it should continue to rise for 
about fifteen minutes after going into the oven, then the 
rising should cease and the loaf begin to brown. 

A loaf of bread of medium size requires from one to 
one and one-fourth hours for baking. 

Dlgeatibmty. 

Freshly baked bread cannot be sufficiently masticated 
to render it easy of digestion. Stale bread, from thirty- 
six to forty-eight houra old, if thoroughly masticated, is 
well digested and absorbed. 

Butter spread on bread not only increases its nutri- 
tive value, but tends to assist its digestibility.

an unpleasant taste to the bread. 

Pulled Bread. 

Make Water Bread in long loaves, so that the grain of

BREAD. 107 

The moisture in the bread should be nearly evaporated, 
thos making the toast dry and crisp. By tiiis means of 
toasting some of the starch becomes dextrinized, and 
the bread is thus rendered easier of digestion. If only 
charred on the outside and soft in the inside^ it forms in 
the stomach a soggy, indigestible mass. 

Toast should never be piled one slice on another, except 
it be cut in suitable shapes, that it may be piled log-cabin 
fashion. If a toast rack is not at hand, balance toast 
against cup placed in warm plate until serving time. 

If toast is desired in finger-shaped pieces, triangles, or 
fancy shapes, it must be cut as desired before being 
toasted.

Printed directions are given for the cooking, the time for 
which is always insufficient. 

Breakfast cereals are valuable, inexpensive foods, and 
their daily use is strongly recommended. It is a fact to

BidUtin S8, U, S. Ikpartinent of AgricuUure, 

Oat preparations rank first as regards nutritive value. 
They contain a stimulating principle which is lacking in 
the other cereals. Owing to the fact that they hold a 
large amount of fat and cellulose, there are many with 
whom they disagree. In such oases their use should be 
avoided. As regards heat-giving properties, com ranks 
next to oats, therefore both are especially adapted for a 
winter diet They are slightly laxative. 



110 FOOD AND OOOKBBT. 

A kernel of wheat is deficient in bat one of the fire 
food principles, namely fat, to make it an ideal food. 
For this reason wheat preparations may be used to advan- 
tage throughout the year. It is a fact that wheat is more 
largely consumed than any other cereal, rice holding 
second place. 

Bice contains more starch and less fat than any of the 
cereals. It has a delicate flavor, but is not as popular in 
the United States, except in the southern part, as wheat, 
oats, or corn. 

Macaroni is made from wheat flour rich in proteid, and 
water. It is manufactured to some extent in this country, 
but the best brands come from Italy. Like the cereals, 
it is an inexpensive, nutritive food. 

All the cereals contain a large percentile of starch, in 
consequence of which they should be thoroughly cooked. 
The following points must be followed for the best results : 

1. Double boiler, the utensil for cooking. 

2. Correct proportions of water, cereal, and salt 
8. Temperature of water, boiling point (212° F.). 

4. Time for cooking. 

5. Manner of serving. 

In cooking cereals the double boiler employed should 
correspond in size to the quantity to be prepared. The 
following recipesc all for the use of the smallest ones 
put upon the market. 

Oftentimes where cereals have not proved popular, it is 
due to the fact that they have been improperly cooked or 
have been served with poor milk, rather than with rich 
milk or thin cream. To avoid monotony, vary the kind 
of cereal, never allowing the same preparation to appear 
on consecutive mornings. 

DlgesttbiUty. 

Breakfast cereals, if properly cooked, are well digested 
and absorbed, holding close rank to animal foods. Of the 
protein there is a loss of fifteen per cent ; of the fat, ten 
per cent ; of the carbohydrate, two per cent.

springs. On the yolk of a fertile egg can be found a spot 
which is the germ.

Farmer^i BtJktin No. 128, U. S. D^Kortment of AgriaiUun. 

Eggs f nmish a yalnable, concentrated proteid food and 
are a nsefnl substitute for meat. They are deficient in 
but one of the five food principles — namely, carbohy- 
drates. From this fact, it may be plainly seen that they 
should be taken in combination with some starchy food, 
which furnishes the necessary bulk for the stomach. 

The proteid found in the white of egg is nearly pure 
albumen. The yolk is of much greater nutritive value 
than the white. Its chemical composition is so complex 
that as yet it is but incompletely understood. It contains 
lime, calcium, iron, and phosphorus in organic combina* 
tions, which renders it readUy absorbed and utilized by 
the body. 

Eggs are expensive, even when obtained at twenty-five 
cents per dozen, but being so valuable a form of food, 



116 FOOD AND C00EBB7. 

tfaey fihonld be ased as freely as possible. They enter 
into the composition of many dishes to which they are 
indispensable. 

Eggs for the sick should be as fresh as possible. If 
received from the market, packed in sawdust, they should 
be removed at once, as they quickly absorb odor from the 
wood, which gives to them an unpleasant flavor. If a 
patient should by chance be served an egg-nog made from 
a poor egg it might be difficult to persuade him to try 
another. 

There are but few people with whom eggs disagree. If 
they cannot be taken it is usually due to the presence of 
lecithin, a nitrogenous, fatty substance found in the yolk 
which readily decomposes and forms acids. Convales- 
cents, ansemics, and consumptives can take from six to 
eight eggs daUy, for an extended period, with most satis- 
factory results; as they yield a large amount of nutriment 
for their bulk. For forced feeding they are most valuable, 
as they can be easily administered and combined with 
milk or broth. 

Eggs deteriorate quickly in value unless air is excluded, 
which prevents the evaporation of water through the shell. 
By the evaporation of water air rushes in, causing decom- 
position. Various gases are given off, — principally, 
sulphuretted hydrogen, which may cause gastric and in- 
testinal disorders. 

Row preserved. 

1. By the exclusion of air by coating, covering, or 

immersing. 

2. By use of low temperature ; that is, cold storage. 

Ways of determining Freshness of Eggs. 

1. The shell of a freshly laid egg is slightly rough. 

2. Shake egg in hand while holding to ear, and there 

should be but little sound. 
8. Put in basin of water and they should sink. 



EGGS. 117 

Dtalers determine the freshness of eggs by holding 
them in front of an electric light or lighted candle in a 
dark room. If they look clear the eggs are fresh; if a 
dark spot is in eyidence the eggs are doubtful. The air 
space at the larger end of a freshly laid egg is quite small, 
but increases as the egg loses value. An egg deterio- 
rates after twenty-four hours. 

Advantages of use in Siok-Room Cookery. 

1. NutritiTe value. 

2. Taste good (if fresh). 

8. Easily digested (if properly cooked). 

4. Free from bacteria. 

5. Contain practically no extractives. 

6. Deficient in uric acid derivatives. 

7. Hold lime, calcium, iron, and phosphorus in organic 

combination. 
Minerals in organic combination are more easily 
absorbed. 

8. Fat in form of emulsion. 

Sffeots of Ck>oklng. 

The white of an egg being nearly pure albumen, serves 
as an excellent illustration for demonstrating the effect of 
heat on the principal constituent of proteid food. Illus- 
trate by experiments. 

1. Albumen is soluble in cold water. 

2. Albumen is coagulated by hot water (184 to 167® F.) 

or by heat. 
8. Albumen is coagulated by mineral acids. 

4. Albumen is dissolved by vegetable acids. 

Exception, Cream of Tartar. 

5. Albumen is coagulated by alcohol. 

Albumen yhen acted upon by heat coagulates at a tem- 
perature of from 184 to 167^ F. ; herein lies the necessity 
of cooking eggs alone ox in combination at a low tem- 
perature. 



118 FOOD AND COOESRT. 

The importance of ttds tniih is best illnstrated by the 
proper preparation of so-called ^^ boiled eggs." K the 
egg is kept at a low temperature throughout the cooking, 
the white is soft and Jelly like. Whereas, if the tempera- 
ture is greatly increased, the white is tough and leathery. 
The yolk of the egg will cook at a relatively lower tem- 
perature than the white. In the former case the egg is 
readily digested ; in the latter case it is difficult of diges- 
tion. Eggs for the sick, if served boiled, should be either 
soft or hard cooked, never midway between. If *^haid 
boiled," the yolk may be reduced readily to a powder, 
which is not difficult of digestion. 

DigestlbUity. 

Eggs are easily digested and well absorbed. Ninety- 
seven per cent of the proteid is absorbed and ninety-four 
per cent of the fat. A raw egg, on account of its bland- 
ness, does not stimulate the flow of gastric Juice, conse- 
quently does not leave the stomach in so short a time as 
a ^^soft cooked" egg. Exception must be made to the 
uncooked white of egg which requires so little digestion 
that it is almost ready for absorption. 

Two *' soft boiled " eggs leave the stomach in one and 
three-fourths hours. 

Two raw eggs leave the stomach in two and one- 
fourth hours. 

Two *'hard boiled" eggs (as commonly taken) leave 
the stomach in three hours. A ** hard boiled " egg cooked 
at a low temperature (175** F.) for forty-five minutes, and 
chopped very finely, will leave the stomach almost as 
quickly as a ^'soft boiled" egg. 

The digestibility of the white of an egg is increased 
by beating. By beating, the walls of the cells, which 
consist of albuminin, are ruptured, thus setting free 
the albumen, which is more quickly acted upon by the 
gastric Juice.

SOUPS, BROTHS, AND STEWB. 127 



CHAPTER XVII. 
SOUPS, BROTHS, AND STEWS. 
COUPS are nsaally divided into two great classes : — 

1. Those made with stock. 

2. Those made without stock. 

Soups made with stock have for their basis beef, 
mutton, veal, poultry, fish or game, separately or in com- 
bination. They include bouillon, brown soup stock, 
consomm£, lamb stock, and white soup stock. These 
should be made in large quantities and require much time 
and care in their preparation. Recipes may be found for 
the same in any reliable cook book. 

Stock soups are valuable chiefly for their extractives. 
When taken as the first course of a dinner they stimulate 
gastric Juice to such an extent that the solid foods which 
follow are much more readily digested than they other- 
wise would be. They are also useful to give variety to 
a liquid diet. 

Soups without stock usually have as their basis cooked 
vegetables, forced through a strainer, diluted with stock 
and milk or milk alone. Cream soups have a food value, 
largely due to the milk and butter which they contain, the 
vegetables being added for the purpose of giving flavor, 
with the exception of peas and beans, which increase nutri- 
tive value.

CHAPTER XVni. 

nsH. 

'C ISH, commonly speaking, is sea food. Fish is at its 
^ best when fresh, and in season. It should be eaten 
as soon as possible after being taken from the water. K 
fish is fresh the eyes and gills are bright, the tail firm, the 
flesh hard, and the scales do not come ofF easily. 
Fish may be classified: 

L Scaly. 

1. White fish (fat secreted in liver). 

Examples: haddock; halibnt, tarbot, floun- 
der, etc. 

2. Oily fish (fat deposited throughout the body). 

Examples: bluefish, eels, mackerel, salmon^ 
etc. 
n. Shell Fish. 

1. MoUusks. Examples: oysters, dams, etc 

2. Crustaceans. Examples: crab, lobster, and 

shrimp. 

The protem and fat of fish, as of meat, are their chief 
nutritive constituents. A large amount of the protein of 
fish is in the form of gelatin. Fish is less rich in extrac- 
tives and less stimulating than meat, for which reason 
people tire of it more quickly. It offers variety rather 
than furnishes a constant diet Fish is less nutritious 
than meat, with the exception of the oily fish, — salmon, 
eels, herrings, etc. 

The popular fallacy that fish is a brain food is un- 
founded. As a matter of fact many kinds of meat con- 
tain more phosphorus than any kind of fish. There is 
no special brain food.

Under scaly fish, white fish is the only dass osoally 
considered in invalid cookery. Exception most be made 
to codfish, which on account of its coarse fibre is never 
allowed. During advanced convalescence, oily fish may 
be occasionally introduced into the dietary. 

Oysters, among mollusks, take first rank. The five food 
principles are represented in their composition, and in 
about the same proportion as in milk. 

Their carbohydrate is in the form of glycogen (animal 
starch). Milk has the advantage over oysters as a 
food, as it is much cheaper and may be taken in large 
quantities. Oysters are taken in such limited numbers 
they furnish a comparatively small amount of nutri- 
ment; they are, however, if eaten raw, very easily 
digested. They offer a pleasing variety to the diet on 
account of their delicious flavor. They may be cooked 



186 FOOD AND COOEEET. 

in a great Tariety of wayB, which enables them to be used 
to advantage. 

Frequently oysters are of a greenish color, which is dne 
not to parasites, as many suppose, but to the green colore 
ing matter in the plant on which the oysters have fed. 

Oysters are in season from September to May. During 
the remaining months, which is their breeding season, 
they are flabby and of inferior flavor. While many belieye 
them to be injurious when out of season, this is not the 
case, if they are eaten soon after being taken from the 
oyster beds. 

Clams are similar in composition to oysters, but are not 
so generally used, nor so well liked. They contain a tough 
portion, which should be discarded in sick-room cookery. 

While analysis shows the nutritive value of lobsters to 
be considerable, they are coarse feeders, which renders 
the fibre dense and close, making them diflScult of diges* 
tion. Lobsters, on account of their price, must be con> 
sidered as a delicacy, except in places where they are 
abundant, and even in such places lobsters of short length 
are frequently sold, which is contrary to law. The United 
States is endeavoring to protect the lobster industry by 
forbidding the sale of all lobsters under certain lengths, 
(which lengths differ in different states), ten inches being 
the shortest 

As a rule, the use of lobsters in the sick-room should 
not be considered. To many they are poisonous, and to 
others with whom they agree they have a decidedly appe- 
tizing effect; to the latter class they are allowed occa* 
sionally during convalescence. 

Salt codfish, on account of its low price and high 
nutritive value, is a most important form of food. When 
finely divided and served %s creamed codfish, it may fur- 
nish the principal dish to a most satisfactory meal. 

Cooking of. 

The same principles which apply to the cooking of meat 
apply also to the cooking of fish, and the same methods 



FISH. 137 

for oooking should be employed. Fish, being less riob fai 
extractives than meat, usually needs the accompaniment 
of some kind of a sauce. 

Digestibility. 

White fish, as a rule, are more easily digested than beef , 
lamb, or chicken. For this reason their use is often recom- 
mended for those of sedentary habits. They furnish a 
desirable substitute for the more stimulating meats during 
warm weather. 

Oily fish are digested with about the same ease and in 
about the same time as meats containing a relatively 
small quantity of fat. 

Salt fish is less easily digested than other fish, due to 
the fact that the fibre is hardened during the process of 
salting. 

While there is a tendency to carry personal idiosyn- 
crasies too far, there are undoubtedly many by whom fish 
cannot be taken. It acts as a poison, oftentimes produc- 
ing diseases of the skin. There are others with whom the 
fat of fish disagrees, causing acidity and eructation of the 
stomach. 

WAYS OF COOEINO. 

Steamed Halibut. 

Clean a small piece of halibut by wiping with a cheese 
doth wrung out of cold water. Put in strainer, and place 
over a kettle of boiling water, cover closely, and keep 
water at boiling point until fish is done. The fish is 
cooked when flesh leaves the bone. Remove to hot 
serving-dish, take off outside skin, and pour around 

Drawn Butter Sauce. Melt three-fourths tablespoon 
butter, add three-fourths tablespoon flour, and when well 
mixed pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, one* 
half cup boiling water. Season with salt, then add three- 
fourths tablespoon butter in small pieces, and one-half 
** hard boiled " egg out in thin slioes. 



188 FOOD AND GOOKBBT. 

BoUed Biiddook* 

Clean and wipe a small piece of haddock, then tie In 
cheese cloth. Pat on trivet placed in stewpan of boiling 
water to which has been added one tablespoon each salt 
and vinegar, having water cover fish. 

Salt adds to the flavor; vinegar helps to keep the fish 
white. Cook nntil flesh separates from bone, the time 
required being about fifteen minutes. Place on hot serv- 
ing-dish|. remove skin, garnish with parsley, and serve 
with 

Eoa Saucb. Melt three-fourths tablespoon butter, add 
three-fourths tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually one- 
half cup scalded milk. Beat yolk one egg, dilute with one 
tablespoon hot mixture, add to remaining mixture, and 
season with salt. 

Broiled nah. 

Smelts and other small fish are broiled whole, some- 
times being split ; while larger fish are cut in slices three- 
fourths inch in thickness for broiling. 

Wipe fish, sprinkle with salt, and put in buttered wire 
broiler, place over hot fire, turning every ten seconds 
during the first minute of the cooking (to coagulate the 
albuminous juices, thus preventing their escape), and 
afterwards occasionally. 

When fish is thoroughly heated, brush over, without 
unlocking broiler, with melted butter, first on one side 
then on the other. Cook until well browned on both 
sides, remove to hot serving-dish, sprinkle with salt, 
spread with soft butter, and garnish with parsley and 
lemon cut in fancy shapes. 

Small fish, when spilt for broiling, should be first broiled 
on fiesh side, then turned and browned on skin side Just 
long enough to ma%e skm brown and crisp. To remove 
fish from broiler, loosen fish on one side, turn, and loosen 
on other side, using a three-tined fork.

144 FOOD AND COOKERY. 



Stmotim of Moat* 

Meat is made up of bundles of fibres (tabe-shaped cells) 
oontaining water which holds m solution proteins, extrac- 
tives^ and salt to such an extent that the whole is jelly- 
like in consistency. The walls of the cells consist of an 
albuminoid subst&nce called elastin. The bundles of 
fibres are held together by connective tissue, a gelatinous 
substance called collogen. 

Between the fibres is found soluble albumen. 

The protein of meat consists of different nitr<^enous 
substances which take different names : Myosin, the basis 
of muscle ; fibrin, found in the muscle and the blood; and 
albumen, found in the blood and juices. Fibrin causes blood 
to clot. Gelatin is obtained from connective tissue, tendon, 
cartilage, and bone by boiling with water. Collogen is the 
name given to gelatin in its raw state. Grelatin, although 
highly nitrogenous, cannot fill the place of albumen, but 
spares it to such an extent that it is ranked in food 
classification among the proteins. It is capable of build- 
ing tissues to a small extent, when taken in large 
quantities. 

All meats contain extractives. These and dextrin of 
starch are the only substances that can alone start the flow 
of digestive juices. They have a stimulating effect upon 
the system, and while they have but little food value, are 
of great importance, as to them is due the characteristic 
flavor of all meats. Pawlow writes : " They are the most 
powerful exciters of gastric secretion." The flesh of ma- 
ture animals is richer in extractives than the flesh of 
young animals. 

The fat of meat is intermingled with the lean portion 
or occurs in masses under the skin or about the internal 
organs. The nutritive value of meat depends largely 
upon the quantity of fat it contains. The larger the pro- 
portion of fat, the smaller the proportion of water, the 
fat supplementing the water. 

Phosphoric acid and potash are the chief mineral sub- 
stances found in meat They are very valuable as build- 



MBAT. 145 

ing material, and where there is an insufficient snpply the 
mascles are poorly developed. 

The protein of meat is the most expensive form in 
which protein can be obtained, unless it be from the 
cheapest cuts. Cheap cuts, if^properly cooked, are as 
easily digested and well absorbed as the more expensive 
ones, and their use should be encouraged. The art of 
good cookery is here well emphasized. 



Beef ranks first among meats as regards nutritive value 
and consumption. This may be due in part to the fact 
that people tire less quickly of it than of other meats. 
The opinion is held that the red meats hold the more ex- 
tractives, consequently are more stimulating than the 
white meats ; this, however, is repudiated by Van Noor- 
den, who claims there is little difference between red and 
white meats extractives. 

Ho^7 to determine Good Beef. 

The quality of beef depends upon the breed, environ- 
ment, age, and care in feeding of the animal, and also the 
manner of transportation and the time of hanging of the 
meat. The best beef is obtained from a steer of four or 
five years of age. The creature should hang after killing 
from two to three weeks. During this time lactic acid is 
formed, which acts upon the connective tissue, and the 
meat becomes tender and develops new flavors. First 
quality beef is firm and of fine-grained texture, bright red 
in color, and well mottled and coated with fat The fat 
is firm and of a yellowish color. 

Veal is obtained from the calf, and should never be 
used in the sick-room except for the making of broths. 
It comes from an immature animal, therefore contains but 
little nutritive value, and is difficult of digestion, in this 
latter respect being an exception to the general rule. 

A sweetbread, the thymus gland of the calf, consists of 
two parts connected by tubing and membrane. The 

10 



146 FOOD AND COOKBBT. 

round compact part is called the heart sweetbread ; the 
other portion, the throat sweetbread. They should never be 
bought disconnected, as the heart sweetbread is the more 
desirable. A sweetbread is made up of proteid and fat 
with but little connectiye tissua Its proteid contains 
nnclein, which in digestion gives rise to uric acid derivar 
tives ; therefore its use should be restricted in the dietary 
of a patient who already has an excess of uric acid in the 
system. 

Sweetbreads are the most easily digested of all meats, 
with but one exception, namely, calf s brains, which are 
very poorly absorbed. Sweetbreads are in season dur- 
ing the late spring and early summer. While they are 
obtainable throughout the year, they are very expensive in 
city markets when out of season.

A SIDE OF BEEF. 



Matton and Zdunb. 

Mutton is commonly ranked next to beef in nntritire 
yalne and oonsmnption. According to some authorities 
it holds an equal place, and English writers on the sub- 
ject often give it the preference. All agree that the fat 
of mutton is more difficult of digestion than the fat of 
beef. Lamb is young mutton. When coming from a 
creature killed at the age of from six weeks to three 
months, it is called spring lamb. Spring lamb appears in 
the market as early as February or March, and commands 
a very high price. 



148 FOOD AND OOOEEBT. 

Row to determine Qood Mntton and Xiamb. 

First-qaality mutton comes from a sheep about three 
years old, and like beef should be allowed to hang to 
ripen and develop flavor. Good mutton is fine grained, 
bright pink in color, and the fat is hard, white, and flaky. 
If the skin comes off easily, mutton is sure to be good. 
Lamb should not be allowed to hang, but should be sold 
soon after killing. A leg of lamb may be distinguished 
from a leg of mutton, as the bone at the joint is serrated, 
rather than smooth and rounded. Lamb chops may be 
readily distinguished from mutton chops by the red color 
of the bone. As the creature grows old the blood re- 
cedes from the bone^ therefore in mutton the bone is 
white. A lamb one year old is called a yearling, and fur- 
nishes lamb, while an older animal furnishes mutton. 



Pork as ordinarily considered is the most diflScult of 
digestion of all meats, and in health should seldom be 
used, while in the sick-room it should never be permitted. 
Many cases of ptomaine poisoning have been reported 
from its use. Exception must be made, however, to ham^ 
salt pork, and bacon. A tnin slice of broiled ham, baked 
bacon, or broiled salt pork are well borne by people in the 
early stages of convalescence, the salty taste acting as a 
stimulant to restore lost appetite. The manner of cutting 
and cooking is of the utmost importance. 

Poultry and Oame. 

Poultry includes the domestic birds, while game includes 
the birds and animals which are hunted for food. 

Chicken, fowl, turkey, squab, and quail ai*e allowed in 
the dietary of the sick. 

A chicken is recognized by its soft feet, smooth skin, 
soft cartilage at the end of the breastbone, and frequently, 
by the abundance, of pin-feathers. 



lOSAT. 149 

In fowl the feet arc hard and dry, the cartilage at the 
end of the breastbone is firm, and pin-feathers have given 
place to long hairs. 

Chicken is more easily digested than fowl, but has not 
so great nutritive value. The breast of chicken has very 
short fibres, a small amount of connective tissue, and is 
practically free from fat. It is one of the most easily 
digested cuts of meat. Squabs and quails are likewise 
easily digested, and may be introduced into the dietary of 
a convalescent quite as early as chicken. 

EfifectB of Cooking. 

Stewing, broiling, roasting, and baking are the methods 
employed in the cooking of meats for the sick. 

The method depends on the cut as well as the result to 
be obtained. 

In the cooking there is a loss of water, mineral matter^ 
fat, and some extractives, the greatest loss being in water ; 
consequently cooked meat represents more nutritive value, 
weight for weight, than raw meat

EONIO. 

Cold water draws out the soluble albumen, the extrac- 
tives, and some of the salts of meat. By gradually rais- 
ing the temperature and keeping it at 185° F. for several 
hours, gelatin is obtained from connective tissue and 



150 FOOD AND OOOKSBY. 

bone. In 8onp making this is the object to be aoeom- 
pliflhed. When meat is to be served with the broth, as 
in the case of a stew, it should be pat on in cold water, 
brought qoickiy to the boiling point (212° F.), then al- 
lowed to simmer (185^ F.) until the meat is tender. The 
cheaper cuts should always be used for soups and stews. 
In broiling, baking, or roasting the object is to avoid, 
as far as possible, the loss of nutritive value from the 
meat. This is accomplished by subjecting the meat to a 
high temperature, thus searing the surface as quickly as 
possible, which causes the albumen to coagulate. 

Digestibility. 

Meat is easily digested and well absorbed. 

Experiments have shown that raw meat is more readily 
digested than cooked meat, but, lacking in taste and flavor, 
would soon become unbearable if introduced into the daily 
dietary. Protein is made somewhat less digestible by 
cooking. 

The digestibility of meat depends upon the length and 
thickness of the individual fibres, the quantity of fat 
between the fibres, and the hardness and denseness of 
connecting tissues. Jessen has found that beef and 
mutton aro digested in the same time. It cannot be 
denied, however, that the fat of mutton is more difiScult 
of digestion than the fat of beef, owing to the larger 
quantity of stearic acid present. 

The meat of young animals (veal excepted) is more 
easUy digested but less nutritious than the meat of older 
animals — as the walls of the muscle tubes are more deli- 
cate and there is less connective tissues. 

WAYS OF COOKINO. 
Beef Balls. 

Wipe a smalt piece steak cut from top of round, and 
cut in one-fourth inch strips. Lay strips on board and 
scrape separately, using a silver spoon, with grain of 
meat first on one side and then on other, to remove soft

Prepare beef according to directions given for Beef 
Balls. Season to taste with salt. Divide beef evenly and 
put roughly on tops of crackers, making several depressions 
in each. Put in a hot oven and let stand until beef has a 
cooked appearance on outside and is slightly heated 
through. Remove from oven, put dots of butter in de- 
pressions. Place in oven and let stand long enough to 
melt the butter. Remove to plate and serve at once. 

Beef in Cream on Toast. 

yi onp cream. Salt. 

8 tablespoons scraped beef. 1 slice dry toast. 

Heat cream, add beef, and cook until meat is discolored, 
stirring constantly. Season to taste, pour over toast and 
serve at once. 

Broiled Beefiiteak. 

m 

Wipe a small piece steak cut one inch thick. Heat a 
wire broiler, put in steak, and place over a dear fire, 
turning every ten seconds for the first minute that surface 
may be well seared, thus preventing escape of Juices. 
After the first minute turn occasionally until well cooked 
on both sides. Cook five minutes if liked rare. Remove 
to hot serving-dish, spread with soft butter, and sprinkle 
with salt The most tender steaks are tenderloin, rump, 
and sirloin. A tenderloin steak lacks Juice and flavor ; 
for this reason it is often served with Beef Extract I. 



152 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

(see p. 86) poured over it. A thick elice of sirloin steak 
with tenderloin attached is known in oar markets as a 
Porterhouse Steak. A round steak is composed of solid 
lean meat, rich in juices, and if of right age and taken 
from second or third cut from top of round, is compara- 
tively tender, and cheaper than either rump or sirloin. 

Pan Broiled Beef Cakes. 

Wipe and finely chop two ounces steak from upper part 
of round, season with salt, and shape in a flat, circular 
cake, using as little pressure as possible. Heat suiall 
omelet pan, rub over with fat, put in meat, and turn as 
soon as under surface is seared, then turn and sear other 
side. Cook five minutes, turning occasionally, using a 
griddle cake turner that surface may not be pierced. 
Brush oyer with soft butter and sprinkle with salt. 

Broiled Lamb Chops. 

Wipe chops, remove superfluous fat, and place in 
broiler rubbed over with some of the fat Follow direc* 
tions for Broiled Beefsteak (see p. 142). When loin 
chops are used, remove flank and reserve for soup mak- 
ing. The loin chop contains meat on either side of 
bone and corresponds to the Porterhouse steak in the 
beef creature. 

Pan BroUed French Chop. 

Select rib chops, and scrape the bone clean nearly to 
the lean meat, thus making French chops. Put in a 
hissing-hot frying-pan rubbed over with fat. Sear on 
one side, turn and sear other side. Cook six minutes if 
liked rare, eight minutes if liked well done. Turn often 
while cooking, using knife and fork, that the surface may 
not be pierced, as would be liable if fork alone were used. 
Let stand around edge of frying-pan to brown outside 
fat. When half cooked, sprinkle with salt. Drain on 
brown paper, remove to serving-dish, spread with soft 
butter, sprinkle with salt, and stack around a mound of 



KRkT. 153 

mashed potato, potato balls, or green peas. Trim each 
chop bone with a paper f rilL 

Broiled Sweetbread. 

Pnt sweetbread in bowl, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one hoar; drain, remove fat, pipes, and membrane. 
Cook in boiling salted acidulated water twenty minutes, 
allowing one-half tablespoon each salt and vinegar to a 
pair of sweetbreads, then drain again and plunge into cold 
water. 

Sweetbreads cooked in this way are called parboiled 
sweetbreads. This is the first step taken, no matter in 
what way sweetbreads are to be prepared. 

Remove sweetbread from cold water, dry on a towel, 
split one-half sweetbread lengthwise, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, place on a greased fine wire broiler, and 
broil over a clear fire. As soon as sweetbread is heated, 
brush sparingly with melted butter, first on one side, then 
on other^ For serving, spread with soft butter, sprinkle

Parboil sweetbread and cut in one-half inch cubes. 
To one-third cup cubes add one-fourth cup White Sauce 
made as follows : 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add three-fourths 
tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring 
constantly, one-fourth cup milk. Season with salt and 
few grains pepper. Serve in Croustades of Bread (see 
p. 99). 

Olased Sweetbread. 

Parboil one-half sweetbread, preferably the heart 
sweetbread. Place in individual baking-dish, and sprinkle

Broiled Cbiokeo. 

Order chicken split for broiling. Singe, wipe, sprinkle 
with salt, and place on a weU-greased broiler. Broil 
twenty minntes over a dear fire, watching carefally and 
taming broiler so that all parts may be browned equally. 
The flesh side needs the longer exposure to the fire. The 
skin side cooks quickly and then is liable to barn. Re- 
moye to hot platter, spread with soft batter, and sprinkle 
with salt. 

So much time and attention is required for broiling 
a chicken that the work is often simplified by placing 
chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down, sprinkling with 
salt, dotting over with butter, and cooking fifteen minutes 
in a hot oven, then removing to broiler to finish the 
cooking. 

BCaiyland Chlokan. 

Dress, dean, and disjoint one-half broiler. Sprinkle 
with salt, dip in fiour, egg (slightly beaten and diluted 
with two tablespoons cold water), and soft stale bread 
crumbs. Place in a well-greased dripping-pan and bake 
twenty minutes in a hot oven, basting after first five 
minntes of cooking with two tablespoons melted batter. 
Arrange on serving-dish and pour around one-half cup 
White Sauce made as follows: 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add one tablespoon 
flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring constantly, 
one-half cup thin cream. Season with salt. 

Roast Chicken.

and spread breast and legs with one and one-half table- 
spoons batter rubbed until creamy and mixed with one 
and one-half tablespoons flour. Dredge bottom of pan 
with flour. Place in hot oven, and when flour is well 
browned, reduce heat, then baste chicken. Continue bast- 
ing every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For 
basting use two tablespoons butter melted in one-half 
cup boiling water, and after this is gone use fat in pan. 
During cooking, chicken must be turned frequently, that 
it may brown evenly. Made gravies are rich, difficult of 
digestion, and not adapted for invalid cookery ; therefore 
the recipe for the making of gravy is omitted. 

Creamed Chioken. 

Cut cold broiled fowl in one-third inch cubes; there 
should be one-third cup. Add to White Sauce made as 
follows : 

Melt one-half tablespoon butter, add three-fourths 
tablespoon flour, and pour on gradually, while stirring 
constantly, one-fourth cup milk. Season with salt, pepper,

toast points, cubes of jelly, lemon, and parsley. 

A breast of chicken, tenderloin of steak, or lamb chop 
may be broiled in a paper case. 

How to bone a Bird. 

In baying birds for boning, select those which have 
been fresh kiUed, dry picked, and not drawn. Singe, re- 
move pin-feathers, head, and feet, and cut off wings close 
to body. Lay bird on a board, breast down. 

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the skin 
the entire length of body. Scrape the flesh from back- 
bone until end of one shoulder-blade is found; scrape 
flesh from shoulder-blade and continue around wing- joint, 
cutting through tendinous portions which are encountered ; 
then bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone the 
entire length of body, working across the ribs. Free 
wishbone and collar-bones, at same time removing crop 
and windpipe ; continue down breastbone, particular care 
being taken not to break the skin, as it lies very near bone, 
or to cat the delicate membranes which enclose entrails. 
Scrape flesh from second joints and drumsticks, laying it 
back and drawing off as a glove may be drawn from the 
hand. Withdraw carcass and put flesh back in its origi- 
nal shape.

THE Bo-called vegetables, with the exception of peas, 
beans, and lentils, contain a small amount of 
nntriment, bat are valaable, nevertheless, for the lai^e 
amount of water and the mineral matter they contain. 
Vegetables are necessary for the body's needs, as they 
give bulk to the food and possess especial antiscorbutic 
properties. 

In selecting summer vegetables, choose those that are 
fresh and crisp, and when possible purchase from the pro- 
ducer, as they should be cooked as soon after gathering 
as possible. 

Beans and peas, when fresh, young, and tender, may 

be used to advantage in the sick-room. If served when 

old, fhey should be pressed through a strainer after being 

11 



162 FOOD AND GOOKBRT. 

cooked, and made into a pnr6e or soap. In this way the 
cellnlose may be discarded. 

Asparagus appears in the market as one of the early 
native vegetables, and may be introduced into the dietary 
of the convalescent. 

In the spring of the year many patients long for dande- 
lions. Their peculiar bitter flavor acts as a stimulant to 
a flagging appetite. A desire is often expressed for beet 
greens, which may be indulged. 

Cauliflower may be used by the convalescent, while 
cabbage, which belongs to the same family, should be 
avoided except by the people who serve it frequently 
when in health. During the cooking of cabbage certain 
ferments are developed which cause the vegetable when 
eaten to give rise to stomach eructations. 

Onions are wholesome and quite nutritious to persons 
with whom they agree. The Bermuda and Spanish onions 
are much more delicate in flavor than the common garden 
onion. Onions impart a strong odor to the breath, due 
to volatile substances absorbed by the blood, and by the 
blood carried to the lungs, where they are set free. 

The use of broiled or stewed tomatoes in many dis- 
eases is not objectionable ; however, in cases where citric 
acid is to be avoided, tomatoes must be excluded from 
the dietary. A reliable brand of canned tomatoes is quite 
as satisfactory as the fresh vegetable if the canned goods 
are thoroughly re-oxygenated. 

Spinach is found in the market throughout the year, 
but is especially desirable during the winter, when most 
of the green vegetables are expensive and of inferior 
quality. 

Among the summer vegetables, green corn and cucum- 
bers should be avoided, as they are the source of much 
stomach and bowel trouble. 

Unless one has access to the large city markets, the 
supply of vegetables during the winter months is limited 
to squash, turnips, carrots, parsnips, beets, cabbage, and 
onions. Squash is the only one among them all that 



VXGSTABUES. 168 

would not be subject to nnf avorable criticism if used in 
the feeding of the sick, and even this yegetable most be 
excluded from the dietary of the diabetia 

Lettuce is classed among salad greens. It may be 
obtained usually throughout the year, as it is raised 
during the winter in hothouses, at which time it is espe- 
cially palatable. It should be fresh and crisp. The outer 
leaves, which are usually somewhat wilted, should be dis- 
carded. The food value of lettuce is much increased 
when served with a French Dressing. Many a thin person 
would find a real fattening agent in olive olL 

The young, tender stalks of celery often prove an 
appetizer, while radishes would better be avoided on 
account of the large amount of cellulose they contain. 

Among other salad greens may be named chickory, 
water-cress, romaine, and escarole, all of which may be oc- 
casionally introduced into the menu of the convalescent 

Cooking tuL 

y^etables, like all starchy foods, should be cooked in 
freshly boiling water, salt often being added to give 
flavor. By the application of hot water the starch grains 
swell and burst, which gives the starch an opportunity to 
escape through the layers of cellulose. 

From this statement it may be seen that cookery plays 
a very important part towards the complete digestion of 
starchy foods. 

y^etables contain such a small quantity of protein 
that the loss during cooking should be made as slight 
as possible. Like animal protein it is coagulated by 
heat. It is more soluble in cold water than animal 
protein. Thus if v^etables are allowed to soak in 
cold water for too long a time, there will be an appre- 
ciable loss in nutritive value, mineral matter as well as 
protein. 



164 FOOD AND OOOKERT. 

DlgestibUlty. 

The digestibility of vegetables depends upon their 
bulk and the quantity of cellulose they contain. The 
cellulose encloses the starch grains, thus making it difficult 
for the gastric juices to penetrate to the chief constituent 
of most vegetable foods, — starch. 

Neither hot nor cold water has any material effect on 
cellulose, even in young, tender vegetables. It may 
be stated as a general rule that vegetable food is less 
completely digested and absorbed than animal food. 
There are, however, some striking exceptions to this 
rule, namely, macaroni and rice. 

Vegetables throw a large amount of mechanical work 
on the stomach. As the gastric ferments play no part in 
the digestion of starchy foods, and as the food must be 
reduced to such a consistency as to be able to be forced 
on into the small intestine, it would seem desirable 
to restrict this class of foods for those with enfeebled 
digestion. 

WATS OF COOKING. 

Boiled Asparagus. 

Cut off lower parts of nine stalks asparagus at the 
point at which they will snap. Wash, remove scales, 
and tie together. Cook in boiling salted water until sof t, 
time required being from twenty to thirty-five minutes. 
Tips should be kept out of water for the first ten minutes 
of the cooking. Drain, place on hot serving-dish, spread 
with one-half tablespoon butter, and sprinkle with salt. 

Asparagns on Toast. 

Serve Boiled Asparagus on buttered toast, moistened 
with some of the water in which asparagus was cooked. 

Asparagus with Milk Toast. 

Serve Boiled Asparagus on Milk Toast, pouring two 
tablespoons sauce over asparagus. 



VXOETAfiLES. 165 

Creamed Aeparagiu Tips. 

Wash asparagus stalks, remove scales, and cut in one- 
inch pieces. Ck)ok in boiling salted water until soft, 
cooking tips a shorter time than stalks. Drain and add 
to White Sauce I. (see p. 149). 

String Beans. 

Remove strings from beans and snap or cut in one inch 
pieces. Wash in cold water and cook in boiling water 
until soft, the time required being from one to three 
hours. Drain and season with butter and salt. Never 
buy string beans unless they are fresh and will snap 
easily. Cook beans in as little water as possible. 

Shell Beans. 

Shell beans may be bought either in or out of the shell. 
Wash beans and cook in boiling water from one to one 
and one-half hours, adding salt the last half hour of cook- 
ing. Cook in sufficiently small quantity of water, that 
there may be none to drain off when beans are cooked. 
Season with butter and salt. 

Shell beans may be cooked some time before needed 
and reheated for serving, providing butter has not been 
added. 

Bmssela Sprouts in White Sauce. 

IHck over two-thirds cup sprouts, remove wilted leaves, 
and soak in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook in boiling 
salted water twenty minutes, or until easily pierced with a 
skewer. Drain and add to White Sauce I. (see p. 149). 

Creamed Cauliflower. 

Remove leaves, cut off stalk, and soa^ a small cauli- 
flower thirty minutes, head down, in cold water to cover. 
Cook, head up, twenty minutes, or until soft, in boiling 
salted water. Drain, separate flowerets, and to two- 
thirds cup add White Sauce L (see p. 149). 



166 FOOD AHD COOKERY. 

Caleiy. 

To prepare celery for table, cut off roots and leayee, 
separate stalks, wash, scrape, and chill in cold or ice 
water. By adding a slice of lemon to water, celery is 
kept white and made crisp. If one end of stalks is 
curled, celery looks more attractive for serying. 

Curled Celery. 

Cut thick stalk celery in two-inch pieces. With a 
sharp knife, beginning at outside of stalks, make five 
cuts parallel to each other extending one-third the length 
of pieces. Make six cuts at right angles to cuts already 
made. Put pieces in ice water and let stand for several 
hours, when celery will curl and be found crisp. 

Beet Greens. 

Wash thoroughly, scrape roots, and cut off ends. 
Drain and cook one hour, or until tendeis in a small 
quantity of boiling salted water. Drain again and 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

DandeUonp. 

Wash thoroughly, remove roots, drain, and cook one 

hour, or until tender, in boiling salted water. Drain 

again, season with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve 

with vinegar. 

Iiettuoe. 

In buying lettuce select small, heavy heads with firm, 
light-colored centres. Remove leaves from stalk, dis- 
carding outer leaves. Wash in cold water, drain, and dry 
on towel, putting leaves so that water may drop from 
them. Keep in cold place until serving time. 

French DresAng usually accompanies lettuce. 

Boiled Oniozis. 

Put onions in cold water and remove skins, using a 
vegetable knife, while under water. Put in saucepan,

cover with boiling salted water, and boil five minates; 
drain, and i^ain cover with boiling salted water. Ck>ok 
one hoar, or nntil soft bat not broken. Drain again, add 
a small quantity of milk, cook five minates, and season 
with batter and salt 

Green Peas. 

Bemove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one-half hoar. Skim off andeveloped peas which 
rise to top and drain remaining peas. Cook antil soft 
in a small qaantity of boiling water. There shoald be 
bat little if any water to drain from peas when they are 
cooked. If peas have lost mach of their nataral sweet- 
ness they are mach improved by a small qaantity of 
sagar. Season with batter and salt. 

Creamed Peas. 

Binse thoronghly one-third cap canned peas, cover with 
boiling water, boil one minate, and again drain. Add to 
peas one-half tablespoon batter and cook foar minates. 
Dredge with one teaspoon flour mixed with one-eighth 
teaspoon sugar. Add one tablespoon cream, and salt and 
pepper to taste. 

CrouBtades of Peas. 

Serve Creamed Peas in Croastades of Bread (see 
p. 99). 

Boiled Spinach. 

Bemove roots, carefully pick over (discarding wilted 
leaves), and wash in several waters, to be sure that it is 
free from sand. If young and tender put in stew pan, 
heat gradually, and cook twenty-five minutes in its own 
juices. If old cook in boiling salted water, allowing one- 
fourth as much water as spinach. Drain, chop, reheat, 
and season with butter and salt. Gramish with slices of 
*^ hard boiled " egg. 

The green color of spinach is better retained by cooking 
in a large quantity of water in an uncovered vessel.

Broiled Tomatoes. 

Wipe, cut in halves crosswise, and cut off a thin slice 
from rounding part of each half. Sprinkle with salt, dip 
in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again, place in a well-buttered 
broiler, and broil six to eight minutes. 

Baked Stuffed Tomatoes. 

Wipe and remove thin slice from stem end of two small 
tomatoes, take out seeds and pulp, sprinkle inside with 
salt, invert and let stand twenty minutes. To pulp add 
an equal quantity of soft stale bread crumbs, season 
with salt, pepper, and a few drops onion juice and refill 
tomatoes with mixture. Sprinkle with buttered crumbs 
and bake in a hot oven fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Baked Tomatoes Virginia Style. 

Wipe one medium-sized tomato. Put into a small 
casserole dish, sprinkle with salt, and bake until tomato 
is Soft but does not lose its shape. Remove the skin and 
pour over White Sauce I (see p. 159) and serve at once. 



POTATOES. 169 



CHAPTER XXL 
POTATOES. 

COMPOSITION. 

Water, 78.9%. Proteid, 2.1%. 

Starch, 18%. Mineral matter, .0%. 

Fat, .1%. 

IDOTATOES are tabers of the plant Solanum tuberosum. 
^ It may be seen from studying their composition that 
their food value lies, principally, in the starch which they 
contain. Being deficient in proteid and fat, they should 
be used in combination with such foods as eggs, meat, 
or fish. 

Seldom a day passes that potatoes do not appear on the 
menu of one or more meals, which proves them to be a 
popular, inexpensive food. If properly cooked they are 
more easily digested than most of the vegetable foods, as 
they contain but a comparatively small quantity of cellu- 
lose. Their digestibility is increased by being mashed. 
If they are allowed to enter the stomach in large pieces, 
as is sometimes the case when boiled potatoes are served, 
they are liable to cause gastric disturbance. 

The method preferred for cooking potatoes when to be 
served to a young child or convalescent, is baking, in a 
hot oven, which changes some of the starch to dextrine, 
thus increasing its digestibility. If baked in an oven at 
a low temperature, they have no advantage over boiled 
or steamed potatoes. Potatoes should be served at once 
after cooking. Warmed-over potatoes, while very palat- 
able to those in health, should be avoided in the dietary 
of the sick. 

Potatoes contain an acrid principle, the greater part of 
which lies near the skin. For this reason potatoes are 



170 POOD AJm COOKBBT. 

OBiudly pared when prepared for boiling. It mnst be 
remembered, howeTer, that there is a greater untritiye 
I0B8 than when cooked with the jaekete on. This Iobs 
consiats largely of the mineral conatitQent, which may be 
well supplied by green vegetables. 

When new potatoes first appear in the market they are 
not a desirable food for the siok-room, as the starch is 
not thoronghly matured. 

Baked Potatoea. 

Select smooth, mediam-siced potatoes. Wash, using a 
vegetable brush, and place on a tin plate. Bake in hot 
oven forty minutes, or until soft Remove from oven, 
press between the fingers, and rupture skin. Take from 
skin, and serve at once with butter and salt, or cream 
and salt. If allowed to stand they soon become soggy, 
as the starch reabsorbs moisture. 

Potato k la Suette. 

Wash a smooth, round, medium-siaed potato, and bake 
in a hot oven until soft. Cut a slice from top and 
scoop out most of the inside. Force through a potato 
ricer, season with butter, salt, and pepper and add a small 
quantity of milk. Break an egg into a cup and slip into 
potato case. Force potato mixture through a pastry bag 
and tube around edge. Return to oven and bake until 
^g is set Arrange on serving dish and garnish with 
water-oress.

POTATOES. 171 

Wash and pare potatoes. Drop at once into cold water 
to prevent discoloration. Let stand thirty minntes or 
longer. In the spring several hours will do no harm, as 
the starch in the potato has become to some extent 
changed to dextrin, which gives a sweet taste. By long 
soaking the potato upon cooking becomes more mealy. 

Drain, cook in a small saucepan of boiling salted 
water, being sure water covers potatoes, until soft, which 
may be easily determined by piercing with a skewer or 
fork. Pour off water and let potatoes stand in warm 
place that steam may escape. Avoid serving in covered 
dish, as condensed steam causes the potato to become 
soggy. 

Steamed Potatoes. 

Prepare potatoes as for Boiled Potatoes. Put in small 
strainer, place over kettle of boiling water, cover tightly, 
and cook until soft.

CHAPTER XXn, 

SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 

CALADS are compounds of cold cooked meat, fiah, eggs, 
^ cheese, vegetables, or fruits with a salad green (let- 
tuce, chickory, escarole, romaine, water-cress, cucumbers, 
celery, or radishes) and a dressing. They find no place 
in cookery for the sick except during the advanced stages 
of convalescence, in chronic and wasting diseases, or after 
a sui^ical operation. 

Salad greens have but little food value, but are useful 
for the water and potash salts they contain, besides being 
cooling, refreshing, and stimulating to the appetite. In 
selecting salad greens choose only those that are fresh 
and crisp, and see to it that they are thoroughly washed 
and drained before serving. French dressing greatly in- 
creases their nutritive value, and pure olive oil is most 
beneficial to the system. Cream and Mayonnaise dress- 
ings, although highly nutritious, are so complex as to 
render them difficult of digestion. 

Salads are not acceptable unless served cold, and for 
this reason, especially as they are taken near the close 
of the meal, they are apt to retard digestion. 

Dietitians in hospitals are constantly receiving calls 
from private wards for salads, and for this reason a few 
simple salad recipes are introduced. If other combina- 
tions are used, avoid vegetables which contain a large 
quantity of cellulose or many seeds. A lettuce salad 
served with French dressing is usually the most accept- 
able one to offer with a dinner. Meat, fish, egg, and 
cheese salads should furnish the chief dish of a meal^ 
therefore are adapted for luncheon or supper.

in dressing they will quickly wilt

Mayonnaise Draaalng. 

^ teaspoon mustard. Yolk >^ egg. 

yi tea^Hwn salt. )i tablespoon lemon jnioe. 

^ teaspoon powdered sngar. ^ tablespoon vinegar. 

Few grains cayenne. ^ cup olive oiL 

Mix dry ingredients, add egg yolk, stir until well 
mixed, and add a few dropd vinegar ; then add oil grad- 
ually at first, drop by drop, and stir constantly. As 
mixture thickens, thin with vinegar until that is used, 
then use lemon juice. Add oil alternately with vinegar 
or lemon juice until all is used, stirring or beating con- 
stantly. After the mixture is well thickened the oil may 
be added in a slow, steady stream, while the beating is 
continued vigorously. Oil for the making of Mayonnaise 
should be thoroughly chilled, and egg should be fresh 
and have- been kept in ice box or cold place. 

It is desirable, although not absolutely necessary, for 
bowl containing mixture to be placed in a larger bowl 
of ice water. 

A silver fork, wire whisk, small wooden spoon, or 
Dover Egg Beater may be used as preferred. 

The making of Mayonnaise often troubles the inex- 
perienced cook, while in reality, if the egg is fresh and 
cold, the oil thoroughly chilled, and the work done 
quickly and deftly, the process is a very simple one. 

During the making of Mayonnaise if the conditions are 
not right the mixture often becomes curdled. The same 
thing may take place if too long a time is taken in its 
preparation. Should it become curdled, a smooth con- 
sistency may be restored by taking remaining half of egg 
yolk and adding mixture slowly to it, beating constantly. 
A Mayonnaise when done should be stiff enough to hold 

its shape. 

Oil Dreming. 

Yolks 2 *< hard-boiled " eggs. ^ teaspoon mustard. 
1 tablespoon olive oil. ^ teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon vinegar. Few grains cayenne. 

Rub yolks of eggs until smooth, add seasonings, then 
gradually oil and vinegar.

SALADS. 
DreMed Iiettaoe. 

Remove leaves from stalk, discarding outside wilted 
ones. Wash each leaf separately in cold water and 
shake, holding between thumb and forefinger, that 
leaves may not be broken. Arrange leaves on a towel 
in such a way that the water that remains may drop 
from them. Serve with Boiled or French Dressing. 

If the outside leaves are tender, the edges may be 
trimmed with the scissors, then leaves cut in shreds. 
Lettuce may be washed, arranged in its original shape, 
and kept in a covered lard pail in a cool place until 
needed. 

Bgg Salad I. 

Cut one ^^hard-boiled" egg in halves crosswise in 
such a way that tops of halves are left in small points. 
To accomplish this a small sharp-pointed vegetable knife 
is necessary. Remove yolk, rub through a sieve, moisten 
with Boiled Dressing, and refill whites with mixture. Ar- 
range on lettuce leaves, garnish with thin slices of radish 
overlapping each other and a radish cut to represent a 
tulip or chrysanthemum. 

How TO CUT Radishes to BEPRESEin' Tulips. Select 
smooth, firm red radishes of the round variety. Remove 
leaves, leaving stems one inch long; beginning at root 
ends, make seven incisions at equal distances through 
skin extending nearly to stem ends. Pass knife under 
sections of skin and cut as far as incisions extend, then 
make several cuts through fleshy portion. Place in cold 
water and let stand one hour, when sections of skin will 
fold back and centres will open. 

How to cut Radishes to represent Chrysanthe- 
mums. Select round radishes, and cut off a thin slice 
from the root ends. Scrape radishes in several places 
to remove some of the red color. Cut from top nearly 
to stem end in thin parallel slices^ then cut thin slices 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 177 

at right angles to slices already cut. Let stand in cold 

water one hour or more, when radishes will open to look 

tike a flower. 

Bgg Salad II. 

Separate yolk from white of one "hard-boiled" egg. 
Finely chop white, moisten with French Dressing, arrange 
on a lettuce leaf in the form of a circle, and pile yolk, 
forced through a strainer, in the centre. 

Cheese Salad. 

« 

Mash NeufchAtel cheese and shape in form of robin's 
eggs. Roll in parsley that has been dried in cheese cloth, 
then very finely chopped. An*ange three eggs on lettuce 
leaves and serve with French Dressing. 

If the cheese crumbles and cannot be readily shaped, 
moisten with cream. 

Tomato Salad I. 

Peel, chill a tomato, and cut in thirds crosswise. At* 
range on lettuce leaves and serve with French or May* 
onnaise Dressing. 

Tomato Salad II. 

Peel a medium-sized tomato, cut a thin slice from stem 
end, and remove seeds and some of the pulp. Sprinkle 
inside with salt, invert, and let stand one-half hour. Fill 
with sweetbread cut in small cubes, mixed with an equal 
quantity of cold cooked peas and one-half the quantity 
of finely cut celery moistened with dressing. Arrange on 
lettuce leaves for serving. 

Tomato Basket "witb, Peas. 

Select a small, shapely, bright red tomato, with a 
piece of the stem left on. Cut in shape of basket, and 
scoop out pulp and seeds, using a spoon or French vege- 
table cutter. Refill basket with cold cooked peas mois- 
tened with French Dressing and mixed with two halves 

of walnut meats broken in pieces.

Sweetbread and Celeiy Salad. 

Flrepare same as Chicken Salad, sabstitating sweetbread 
in place of chicken. 

A sweetbread and celery salad is attractively served in 
a ripe red apple prepared by removing a slice from stem 
end, scooping oat all palp that is possible, leaving Just 
enough that apple may retain its shape. 

SANDWICHES. 

The first requisite in the preparation of sandwiches is 
bread of close, even textare from twenty-four to thirty- 
six hours old. White, entire wheat, Graham, or brown 
bread may be used; also Zwieback and some varieties 
of thin unsweetened crackers. Patients are tempted 
often to eat bread and butter when served in the form 
of a sandwich, when they would refuse the slice of 
bread accompanied by the butter ball. The shape, too, 
often makes a difference. A heart-shaped sandwich 
often pleases an adult as well as a child. Men and 
women are certainly but children of an older growth, 
which fact is especially emphasized during times of 
sickness and suffering. 

Bread for sandwiches should be cut as thin as possi- 
ble, and all crusts should be removed. In order to aooom- 
piish this a sharp, thin-bladed knife is an essentiaL 



SALADS AND SANDWICHES. 179 

If butter is used it shoold be creamed (using a wooden 
spoon or silver fork) and spread on the loaf before the 
slices are cnt, unless the sandwiches are to be formed in 
round or fancy shapes, when there would be a loss of 
butter. 

After bread is sliced spread one-half the pieces with 
filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cut in shapes. 
If bread is first cut in shapes, then one-half the pieces 
spread with mixture, the mixture either does not come 
to edges or extends over them, thus detracting from the 
appearance of the finished sandwich. 

If sandwiches are prepared before serving time they 
may be kept fresh and moist by wrapping in paraflSne 
paper or a napkin wrung as dry as possible out of hot 
water. 

Sandwiches should be served on a plate covered with 
a doily. 

Bread and Butter Sandwlofaes. 

Bemove end slice from loaf of bread, and spread end 
of loaf evenly with butter which has been creamed. 

Cut off as thin a slice as possible, taking care that it 
is of uniform thickness. Repeat until the required num- 
ber of slices are prepared. Put together in pairs, re- 
move crusts, and cut in squares, oblongs, or triangles. 

Bntira Wheat Sandwlohea. 

Prepare same as Bread and Butter Sandwiches, using 
Entire Wheat Bread. 

Haw Beef Sandwiches. 

Scrape beef, cut from round, same as for Beef Balls 
(see p. 141). Prepare bread as for Bread and Butter 
Sandwiches. Spread one-half the pieces with scraped 
beef seasoned with salt; if pepper is desired, use spar- 
ingly. Cover with remaining pieces, then cut in finger- 
shaped pieces or triangles.

Mayonnaise Dressing (see pp. 164, 165) on each leaf. The 
B}ices of bread must be put together in pairs, cut in shapes, 
and then separated to insert the lettuce leaf, which should 
extend over the edge of bread.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

FBOZSK DES8SBTS. 

T^ROZEN desserts, whether in the form of ices or 
^ creams, are of inestimable yalue in the sick-room^ 
if given at the proper time and under favorable con- 
ditions. They had better be served with a simple meal 
or between meals, for if introdaced as the last course of 
a dinner they are apt to reduce the temperature of the 
stomach contents and thus for a time retard digestion. 
However, if eaten slowly, as they always should be, the 
effect upon digestion is slighter than is usually supposed. 

If eggs and cream enter into their composition, es- 
pecially if the cream be of good quality, they have a high 
food value. Patients, especially children, with but little 
appetite are often tempted by ice cream, and it is fre- 
q((iently ordered by physicians, as they realize the neces- 
sity of sufficient nourishment and know the value of the 
dish they are recommending. 

When ice cream is home-made, care must be taken that 
it is not too rich nor too sweet ; there is seldom danger of 
these errors in the caterer's products. 

For the individual recipes of ices and ice creams an ice 
cream freezer of ordinary capacity proves impracticable. 
A baby ice cream freezer is on the market which answers 
the purpose, but as these are owned by but a few, a 
freezer may be improvised which does ^e work to the 
satisfaction of the nurse. A five-pound lard pail, one- 
pound baking powder can, silver-plated knife and spoon, 
complete the outfit If the mixture to be frozen is a 
water ice, containing fruit Juices, a jelly tumbler with 
fitted cover is substituted for the baking powder can, as 



FROZEN DESSERTS. 207 

the action of the acid on the tin is liable to produce a 
poisonous compound. 

Chemiitry of freeiing Ices and Creams. 

Ice and rock or coarse fine salt are used for freezing 
ices and creams. Salt has a great affinity for water, 
causing the ice to melt rapidly, thus withdrawing heat 
from the contents of the can, which causes the mixture to 
freeze. The principle of latent heat is here demonstrated. 
In the one case the ice, a solid, is changed to a liquid ; 
in the other case the liquid mixture is changed to a solid. 

How to freeae Ices and Creams. 

Finely crushed ice and rock or coarse fine salt are 
necessary for the freezing of ices and creams. They are 
used in the proportion of three parts ice to one part salt. 
These proportions are satisfactory for the production of a 
smooth, fine-grained cream. 

If more salt is employed the cream is coarser and less 
smooth in texture ; where less salt is used more time is 
required for the freezing, with no better results. When 
water ices are to be frozen, one-half salt and one-half ice 
is employed, if a granular consistency is desired, as is the 
case in frapp^s or granites. 

Cover bottom of pail with crushed ice, put in baking 
powder box or tumbler containing mixture to be frozen, 
and surround with ice and salt in correct proportions, 
adding ice and salt alternately, until the pail is two- 
thirds full. 

Turn box or tumbler with hand^ and as soon as mixture 
begins to freeze scrape frozen portion from sides of box 
or tumbler and beat mixture with a spoon, so continuing 
until the entire mixture is frozen. 

If the baby ice cream freezer is used, fill tub with ice 
and salt in correct proportions, turn crank slowly at first, 
that the contents nearest the can may be acted upon by 
the salt and ice. After the mixture is frozen to the oon- 



208 FOOD AND GOOKBBT. 

sietency of a mush, then the crank may be turned more 
rapidly. Do not draw off the water until the freezing is 
accomplished, unless there is a possibility of the salt water 
getting into the can« 

An ice shaver or a small burlap bag and wooden mallet 
are the best utensils for crushing ice.

FBUnS are, nsoally, at their best when served fresh, 
ripe, and in season, and there are but few with whom 
they do not agree. Those who cannot take them in the 
raw state often find them acceptable when cooked. 

Fresh fruits have but little food value, but their use in 
dietaries is of great importance nevertheless, on account 
of the mineral constituents which they contain. These 
constituents are made of potash combined with various 
vegetable acids, namely, tartaric, citric, malic, oxalic, etc., 
which render the blood more alkaline and the urine less 
acid. The antiscorbutic value of fruits is due to thest 



214 FOOD AKD GOOKIRT. 

coDstitnents. A case of scurvy is quickly acted upon by 
the use of fresh fruits. 

The nutritive value of fruits is chiefly in the form of 
fruit sugar (levulose), although some fruits contain cane 
sugar (sucrose) as well as fruit sugar. Examples : apples, 
apricots, pineapples, etc. The carbohydrate of fruit con- 
tains, besides sugar, vegetable gums, which when boiled 
yield a jelly-like substance. Exception must be made 
to bananas, which contain their carbohydrate largely in the 
form of starch. Dried fruits have much greater nutritive 
value than fresh fruits. Weight for weight, dried figs are 
more nourishing than bread. 

The flavor of fruits, although of no nutritive value, helps 
to make them useful as foods, as they act as stimulants 
to the appetite and aids to digestion. 

In selecting fresh fruit choose that which is sound, 
firm, and not over-ripe. Fruit which has began to de- 
compose contains micro-organisms, which are likely to 
cause many ills. Bruised, imperfect fruit, even if bought 
at a small price, proves no economy. 

Cooking of. 

The flavor of fruits is impaired by cooking, but when 
they contain a large proportion of cellulose their digesti- 
bility is increased. 

Cooking fruits also converts their gums into a gelati- 
nous form, which change is demonstrated in the making 
of jellies. 

Unripe fruits, which ought never to be allowed in the 
raw state, are rendered fit for consumption by cooking. 

Digestibility. 

The digestibility of fruits depends largely upon the 
quantity of cellulose they contain, their number of seeds, 
and their ripeness; also the fineness of their division 
when reaching the stomach. 

Peach pulp forced through a sieve or scraped apple 
pulp is often easily digested, when, if eaten in the usual 



FRUITS AND HOW TO SERYE THBM. 215 

way and imperfectly masticated, would prove a stomach 
irritant. When uuripe fruits are eaten their excess of 
acids causes pain, colic, diarrhoea, and nausea. During 
the ripening of fruits their sugar increases, while their 
acids decrease. Ripe fruits act as a mild stimulant to 
digestion. 

Baked Applea. 

Wipe, core, and pare sour apples. Put in an earthen 
or granite ware baking-dish, fill cavities with sugar, and 
allow six drops lemon juice to each apple, then cover 
bottom of dish with boiling water. Bake in a hot oven 
until soft, basting every eight minutes with syrup in dish. 
Care must be taken that apples do not lose their shape. 
In the spring of the year when apples are somewhat flat 
and insipid to the taste, a few gratings nutmeg, which 
should be mixed with the sugar, are a great improvement 
to baked apples. Serve hot or cold, with or without 
sugar and cream. 

Belmont Baked Apples. 

Wipe selected red apples and make two circular cuts 
through skin, leaving a three-fourths-inch band around 
apple midway between stem and blossom ends. Put in an 
earthem or graniteware baking dish, sprinkle generously 
with sugar, and add water to cover bottom of pan. Bake 
in a hot oven until soft, basting every eight minutes with 
syrup in pan. Remove to serving dish and pour around 
syrup. 

Apple Banoa. 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare two apples. Make a 
syrup by boiling one-third cup, each, water and sugar, 
and a few grains salt, six minutes. Add apple to cover 
bottom of saucepan, and cook until soft^ watching care- 
fully that sections of apple do not lose their shape. Re- 
move from syrup, then cook remaining pieces. Strain 
syrup remaining in pan over apples. 



216 FOOD AND OOOKERT. 

Strained Apple Sanoe. 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare one and one-half apples. 
Put in saucepan, sprinkle with sugar, add a few grains 
salt, and enough water to prevent apples from burning. 
Cook slowly until apples are soft, then rub through a 
sieve. 

The quantity of sugar and water used must depend on 
the sweetness and Juiciness of the fruit. 

Baked Apple Sauoe. 

1}4 apples (pared, cored, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 
cut in eighths). 1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

1 tablespoon water. 

Put alternate layers of apple, sugar, and seasonings in 
a small earthen baking-dish ; cover, and bake in a slow 
oven for one hour. A few gratings nutmeg may be used 
if desired. Serve hot or cold. 

Apples in Bloom. 

Select a medium-sized bright red apple. Wipe, and 
put in small saucepan. Add two- thirds cup boiling water 
and cook slowly until apple is soft, turning frequently. 
Take from saucepan, and remove skin carefully, using a 
silver knife. Scrape off all pulp that adheres to skin and 
replace on apple, that the red color may not be lost To 
water in saucepan add one and one-half tablespoons 
sugar, few gratings lemon rind, and three-fourths table- 
spoon orange Juice. Let simmer until syrup is reduced 
to two tablespoons, then strain over apple. Chill, and 
serve with wUpped cream. 

Apple Snow. 

Wipe, pare, core, and quarter one sour apple. Put in 
small strainer, place over boiling water, cover, and let 
steam until apple is soft, then rub through a sieve ; there 
should be one-fourth cup apple pulp. Beat white of one 



FRUITS AND HOW TO SERVE THEM. 217

How to serve a Banana. 

Remove skin from a thoroughly ripe banana, and scrape 
to remove the astringent principle which lies close to skin. 
Cut in thin slices, arrange on a serving-dish, sprinkle with 
sugar and a few drops lemon juice. 

Banana is served frequently with sugar and cream, but 
proves difQcult of digestion to most people in health; 
therefore its use would better be avoided for the sick. 

Baked Banana. 

Wipe banana and loosen one section of skin, then re- 
place. Put in shallow pan, cover, and bake until skin is 
very dark, when banana should be soft Remove from 
skin, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve at once. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Pick over and wash one cup cranberries. Put in sauce- 
pan, add one-third cup sugar, and one-third cup water, 
bring to boiling point, and let boil five minutes. Remove 
from fire, force tiirough a strainer, and cool. 

Cranberry Jelly. 

Pick over and wash one cup cranberries. Put in sauce- 
pan, add one-half cup sugar and one-fourth cup water.

much air as possible ; then cut and fold in flour mixed 
and sifted with salt. Bake forty minutes in a small deep 
cake pan. The cake should begin to rise during the first 
ten minutes, continue rising, and begin to brown during 
the second ten minutes; continue bro¥ming during the 
next ten minutes, and in the last ten minutes finish baking 
and shrink from the pan. The success of a sponge cake 
depends upon the amount of air beaten into the eggs and 
the expansion of that air during baking. A slow oyen 
is necessary for the baking of a genuine sponge cake. So- 
called sponge cake recipes which call for baking powder 
require a moderate oven.

CHAPTER XXTX. 



DIABETES meanB grape sugar in the urine on an 
ordinary diet. In the first stage of the disease 
starch turns to sugar; in the second, albumen; and in 
the third, fat 

Diabetes is essentially a dietetic disease quite oonunon 
and on tlie increase during the last forty years. It is a 
disease which has to be searched for, and a urine test is 
the only sure way by which it is diagnosed. No drug or 
medicinal remedy has yet been found which is a cura- 
tiye, but prescribed diet keeps the disease under control, 
and unless the case is severe and of long standing sugar 
may entirely disappear from the urine. It might seem 
from this statement that diabetic cures have been accom- 
plished, though such is the case only with the rarest 
exceptions. 

When the disease develops in childhood it is usually 
severe, but little can be done, and the patient lives but 
a few weeks or months. There is a case reported by 
Naunyn in his work on Diabetes mellitus, however, which 
is an exception to this rule. When the disease develops in 
adults it is less severe, and life may be prolonged and 
made pleasurable for many years while of a mild type ; 
when it appears in advanced life it is dangerous on ac- 
count of complications. 

1 A Diabetic Chart by Elliott P. Joslin, M. D., and Hany W. 
Goodall, M. D., Boston, Mass. (reprinted from the Boston Medical and 
Snrgical Jonmal, Vol. clpii, No. 8, pp. 248-251. Feb. 20, 1908) 
D. C. Heath & Co., 120 Boylston St., Boston, Mass. 



DUBETES. 229 

The average daily diet for a diabetic patient^ sugar free, 
has been estimated to inclade : 

Protein 75 grams x 4 = 800 calories. 

Carbohydrate 100 «* x 4 = 400 " 

Fat 200 « X 9 = 1800 " 

Total caloric valae 2500 

It may be seen from the above table that it is necessary 
to eliminate the carbohydrates as far as possible, to reduce 
the proteins and greatly to increase the fats in dietetic 
diet, allowing one hundred and fifty more grams of fat 
than the daily dietary of a healthy person requires. The 
change in diet must be a gradual one, as a too sudden 
reduction of the carbohydrates might prove fatal. Acids 
are constantly being formed from proteins taken into the 
body, and these bum in a carbohydrate fire, and acid for- 
mation increases when carbohydrates are cut down. The 
amount further increased, by restricting v^etables, the 
salts which neutralize these acids are diminished, and if 
not kept under control will cause acid poisoning. It is an 
imperative need that there be a movement of the bowels 
every day. If there be a neglect in this direction patients 
are more liable to succumb to acid poisoning. Bicar- 
bonate of soda is used in large quantities to aid in the 
neutralization of the acids. 

The first duty of the physician is to decrease the 
quantity of sugar in the urine, and as far as possible 
restore the power to assimilate carbohyd]:ates, which is 
accomplished by resting those functions of the body 
which are used in the digestion of the same. If the latter 
is not accomplished the power to assimilate such foods 
gradually diminishes. 

A starvation diet for twenty-four hours, followed by 
a few days of oatmeal diet, and this followed by a few 
days of vegetable diet is often necessary to make a patient 
sugar-free. Tea and coffee (without sugar or cream) and 
beef tea and bouillon are allowed on a starvation diet. 
On an oatmeal diet from four to eight ounces of steamed 



280 • FOOD AND COOKERY. 

cooked oatmeal are given daily (either in the form of 
mosh or gmel) to which is added at serving time an equal 
amoont of batter. Feedings should be given every two or 
three hours. Vegetables containing not more than six 
per cent carbohydrates are allowed on a vegetable diet 
and it is best to select the ones that will take up a large 
amount of batter. Tea» coffee, cracked cocoa, dear 
soaps, broths, and bacon are also introduced. 

FrotelnB In Diet 

The proteins in the diet of the diabetic must be obtained 
from animal foods, from which he can choose almost without 
restriction, as meats, fish, and eggs may be indulged in as the 
appetite dictates. Four eggs may be taken daily. Clams, 
oysters, and mussels contain glycogen (animal starch), 
which is a carbohydrate, therefore they must be avoided, 
except in mild forms of the disease, or allowed in re- 
stricted amounts. Liver contains so little glycogen that 
it is practically never necessary to restrict its use. 

Fats inX>let. 

Many people have a great repugnance to the use of 
much fat, therefore the problem of supplying a sufficient 
quantity to the diabetic is a perplexing one. It must be 
so combined with other foods as to disguise it as far as 
possible, and thus avoid the impression on the patient 
that he is eating a large quantity of fat. 

The best fats are butter, cream, eggs, cheese, olive oil, 
and the fat from bacon, meat, marrow-bone, and oOy fish. 
A diabetic should take at least one-fourth pound batter 
per day, and one-half pint cream. There is but little 
tendency to gastric disorders among diabetics, which 
proves of much assistance in arranging menus. 

Green vegetables prove the most efficient butter car- 
riers, spinach heading the list: Other examples, cabbage, 
asparagus, string beans, etc. If a small quantity of 
potato is allowable it may take up one-half its weight in 
butter and one-fourth its weight in heavy cream.

Cream is preferable to milk, and ehonld be need ae a 
Bubetitate for it as far as possible. There is about five 
per cent of lactose in milk, but only three to foor per 
cent of lactose in cream. 

Cheese and olive oil form a very important article in 
the dietary and may be introduced without much difficulty. 
From the casein in cheese, however, sugar is readily formed.

Grape Fruit. Strawberries. 

Grape fruit and oranges are exceedingly popular and 
seem especially to agree with diabetics. There is rarely 
a stage of the disease when an orange or grape fruit can- 
not be taken once a day. 

Condiments. 

The use of condiments is not restricted. Salt, spices, 
flavoring extracts, vinegar, and table sauces may be used 
as desired, and are of much help in preparing menus. 

Alcohol. 

Brandy, whiskey, rum, gio, claret wine, sour cider, and 
Bollinger dry champagne are all Used, the preference 
generally being shown for brandy ; three to six teaspoons 
are taken daily, while eight may be allowed. Brandy as- 
sists in the digestion of fats. While brandy is consti- 
pating under ordinary conditions, it does not prove so 
with the diabetic on account of the large quantity of fat 

in his diet. 

Beverages. 

One of the symptoms of diabetes is great thirst. Water 
maybe drunk freely ; also tea, coffee, and cocoa nibs, with- 
out sugar. 

Diabetio Breads. 

The most difficult of all starchy foods to take from the 
diet is ordinary white bread. Many diabetic flours have 
been placed upon the market which have proved unsatis- 
factory. Bread made from these flours is seldom liked, 
and if it is tolerated and eaten in considerable quantity, 
as large a quantity of starch is taken as when wheat 
bread containing 55% is used sparingly. A small amount

of carbohydrates, especially oatmeal and potato, may be 
introdaced into the dietary on the advice of a physician.

Sugar SnbatitQtea. 

Saccharine (a coal-tar product three hnndred times 
sweeter than cane sugar), which is added to foods for the 
diabetic is not harmful as is popularly supposed. It is 
usually purchased in the form of tablets. Sdstoff, also a 
chemical substitute, is similar to saccharine, and is just 
being introduced from Germany into our country. Sac- 
charine is introduced to sweeten beverages and desserts. 
When used in desserts it must be added at the end of 
cooking, otherwise a bitter taste is developed. Most 
patients, after a few months of dieting, prefer to get on 
without saccharine. When added to sour fruits it is of 
benefit in making the food less sour rather than making 
it taste sweeter ; therefore, avoid the use of too large a 
quantity. Dissolve a one-half grain tablet in one teaspoon 
luke-warm water and use as needed, add cautiously. The 
amount should not exceed 1} grains daily. 

The one who prepares the food for the diabetic should 
be in close touch with the doctor, and ever ready and will- 
ing to carry out his suggestions. The patient had better

not be oonsalted as regards fhe meniiB, nor have liis 
attention called to what he is eating. 

It is most nnfortnnate if it is neeessary for the inyalicl 
to prepare his own meals, as an i^petite for the foods lie 
most needs is greatly diminished. A diabetic should l>e 
in the open air as much as possible and exercise moder- 
ately bat not get over tired. 

Frequent feeding is desirable for the diabetic, axul 
besides the three meals, several lonches should be 
introduced.

the time which seems to best please the patient. Tho 
quantity is determined by the presence or absence of 
sugar in the urine. Many of the so-called diabetic breads 
contain as much starch as ordinary bread.

CHAFTEB XXX. 
DIBT IN 8FBCIAL DISEASES. 

CONBTXPATIOXr. 

r^NSTIPATION is due, usaaUy, to a n^lect in «t- 
^ tending to the calie of natare. Those suSering 
from constipation should never forget the importance of 
regolarity in this matter and should see to it each <lay at 
a fixed time. This regularity, without other treatment, 
often rids one of the complaint 

Physical exercise and r^ularity in meals also play an 
important part towanls keeping the bowels in a healthy 
condition. Those of sedentary habits are more liable to 
constipation than those engaged in a more active oat- 
of-door life. 

Oftentimes cases of constipation may be overcome by a 
suitable diet. If diet alone will not effect a cure, then 
diet with some medicinal remedy must be tried. 

The simplest remedy is the increase of water in the 
dietary. Cold water to which a small quantity of salt is 
added, taken before breakfast and upon retiring increases 
peristalsis. Many of the saline waters are used to advant- 
age. Liquid vaseline, which is not digested, acts in a 
beneficial manner. Agar Agar, a Japanese sea moss, 
composed mostly of cellulose, increases the moisture in 
the intestinal contents nearly fifty per cent ; therefore its 
use is recommended. 

Coarse foods are recommended always for constipation. 
Such foods contain a large quantity of cellulose, and 
include cereals, coarse breads, vegetables, and fruits. 
They are bulky, slightiy irritating, and leave much resi- 
due in the intestine. There is danger if such foods are 



DIBF m SPBGIAL DISEASES. 259 

taken in excess, as the bowels become tired from over 
stimulation and fail to react. 

Cookery plays a very important part in the digestion 
of foods. Cereals, coarse breads, and vegetables, if 
properly and thoroughly cooked, are well digested, and at 
the same time leave a snfl9cient residue to stimulate the 
intestines to action. 

Fruits, on account of the oiganic acids present, act as a 
laxative, and should be used between meals as well as at 
meals. The juice expressed from two oranges may be 
taken early in the morning to great advantage. Among 
the dried fruits, figs, prunes, dates, and raisins, cooked 
or uncooked, are useful in cases of constipation. 

Fats and oils tend to produce a laxative condition. If 
they have been introduced sparingly in the diet, they may 
be gradually increased until used in moderation. 

The foods most constipating are those that are well 
digested and most completely absorbed. An egg is an 
example of this kind of food. Milk seems to furnish an 
exception to this rule, for although it leaves considerable 
residue in the intestine it is recognized as a constipating 
foocl. 



Diarrhoea is a frequent evacuation of the bowels. If 
the case is a mild one, rest and quiet, with a small supply 
of liquid foods, which yield little residue, will effect a 
cure. In severe cases it is sometimes necessary to ab- 
stain from all food for a short time, giving the entire 
body, as far as possible, complete rest. A patient 
quickly loses strength by withholding food, nevertheless 
it seems the best course to pursue. Hot water may be 
administered by the teaspoonful, and this may be followed 
by thin oatmeal gruel or rice water. Albumen water, 
tea, and blackberry and red wines may be introduced to 
advantage. Tea, and blackberry and red wines act as an 
astringent on account of the tannin they contain. 

From thin gruels gradually work up to thicker ones, 



260 FOOD AND OOOKERY. 

and introduce milk into their preparation with some lime 
water. Frequently an egg may be added. Thin cream 
is well borne in teaspoonfnl doses. 

Scraped raw or rare roast beef and crackers may be 
added to the dietary as the condition of the patient im- 
prores. Fl^parations containing meat extracts always 
should be avoided, as well as aerated water, and, above 
all, cold milk, which would prove disastrous. 

STOMACH TROUBLES. 

The secret of good digestion lies largely in the proper 
cooking and mastication of foods which have been wisely 
selected. Regular hours for meals should also be ob- 
served if one wishes to avoid stomach troubles. 

The causes of stomach trouble, commonly called indi- 
gestion, are so many as to be almost without number. 
Over-feeding, under-feeding, improper feeding, late sup- 
pers, poor ventilation, overwork, want of exercise, worry, 
nervous anxiety, depression of spirits, all tend to retard 
the work of the digestive system. It seems to be the 
office of the physician to locate the cause and try as far 
as possible to alleviate the suffering by making changes 
in diet and administering medicine. 

Indigestion is usually located in the stomach, causing 
faintness, fullness, flatulency, hyper-acidity, hypo-acidity, 
or dilation. Sick headaches too are frequently caused by 
indigestion. 

Patients afflicted with chronic gastric troubles are more 
apt to under-eat than over-eat. When one is suffering 
from malnutrition as well as stomach trouble, the system 
is so reduced that the body as a whole needs to be con- 
sidered as well as the stomach. In dealing with such 
patients their personal idiosyncrasies must be considered. 
Perhaps there is no disease in which they play a more 
important part 

Rest after meals is always to be recommended, which 
is best accomplished by lying down for fifteen minutes or 
even longer. 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 261 



HTPBR-ACZDITY OF THS STOMACH. 

One of the commonest forms in which indigestion 
appears is hyper-acidity of the stomach, which is due to 
an exoessiye amount of gastric Jaice. Tiiis condition 
greatly Relays the passing on of the food into the duo- 
denum by retarding the opening of the pylorus* 

A delay of food in the stomach favors the develop- 
ment of bacteria, also causing acid fermentation. It is 
wise to restrict albuminous food by cutting down the 
quantity of meat A diet composed largely of meat 
produces an excess of acid in the gastric juice. 

Introduce milk into the dietary, which, being without 
extractives, calls forth the least gastric juice of all 
proteid food. Eggs are likewise desirable. It is well to 
increase the fat in the form of unsalted batter, cream, and 
olive oil. Begin by taking one-fourth cup of cream daily, 
and make a gradual increase until one-half cup is con- 
sumed. Fat seems to restrain the flow of gastric juice 
and is most efficacious, if well borne, taken before meals. 
Carbohydrates are apt to cause gas. For this reason give 
those containing the smallest amount of cellulose and 
most easily digested. Examples: — stale bread, rice, 
tapioca, sago, baked or boiled potato, and spinach, finely 
chopped. Hot water, as well as diluting the contents of 
the stomach, increases the frequency and the vigor of 
its muscular movements, therefore its use is advised. 
Warmth always tends to stimulate the opening of the 
pyloric. Where expense is not considered alkaline waters 
taken with meals prove beneficial. 

Restrict the use of foods that increase the acidity of 
the urine, namely, — spinach, rhubarb, water-cress, sorrel, 
tea, coffee, etc. Tea constipates and coffee acts as an 
irritant, but cocoa is allowed. Foods containing oxalic 
acid under ordinary conditions produce no harmful results, 
as so large an amount of the add is unabsorbed, while if 



262 FOOD AND OOOKRRT. 

hyper-acidity of the stomach is present this acid is so wefl 
absorbed that it leads to troable. 

HTPO-ACIDITY OF THB 8TOBCACH. 

In hypo-acidity of the stomach there is a dimininhed 
secretion of hydrochloric acid. The patient enffers from 
distress accompanied by gas, as soon as food is taken. 
Give such things as will stimolate the flow of gastric juice. 
Among proteins select beef juice, white of egg, and sweet- 
breads; among fats, butter; among carbohydrates, toast, 
cracker, rice, and macaroni. Food should be taken in 
small quantities at regular^ frequent intervals. Brandy 
or whiskey, which act as a mild irritant, may be given in 
extreme cases. Sweet wines, ale, or beer should be 
avoided. 

UZiCBR OF THB STOMACH. 

The cause of ulcer of the stomach is not deflnitdy 
known, but may be due to disturbance of circulation in 
stomach, to hyper-acidity, to some foreign body, to too 
hot drinks, or to a combination of these. It is most 
common in enemic or run-down people. If the trouble is 
not recognized it may become chronic. 

Ulcer of the stomach requires rest and restriction of 
all food by the mouth. 

A nutritive enema should be given every six hours, six 
ounces being administered each time, consisting of one 
raw egg, one-fourth teaspoon salt, and one-half cup milk. 
When this quantity is found to be well retained, gradually 
increase the quantity one ounce at a time until nine 
ounces are consumed. One teaspoon sugar may be 
added to each enema. 

An enema of water at body temperature should be 
given once during every twenty-four hours for the pur- 
pose of washing out the bowels, which greatly assists in 
the absorption of rectal feeding. An occasional enema 
of salt solution may be given, allowing one teaspoon salt 
to one pint water. 



BIBT IK SPECIAL DISEASES. 268 

When pain and vomiting have ceased, nonrishment 
may be taken by the mouthy beginning with a thin water- 
oatmeal gruel, administering two teaspoons every two 
hoars, and gradually increasing the amount to the limit 
of from one-half to three-fourths of a cup. If the water- 
gruel is well borne, introduce milk into its preparation, 
followed by milk to which lime water is added. Cocoa, 
chici[en broth with rice, crackers, softened toast, and 
rennet may next be used. Never allow soups rich in 
extractives, and even in advanced convalescence avoid 
the use of irritating or indigestible forms of food. 



The feeding in gastritis should be along the same lines 
as for ulcer of the stomach, rectal feeding seldom being 
necessary. 

While all food should be withheld as long as the 
patient continues to vomit, to relieve thirst occasional 
sips of hot water may be allowed or small pieces of 
crushed ice may be held in the mouth. If the case is 
chronic, any food that will irritate the gastric mucous 
membrane or excite a secretion of mucus must be 
avoided. 

Spices and condiments are forbidden, alcohol is pro- 
hibited, and usually coffee on account of the oil which it 
contains; weak tea, however, is allowed. Cane sugar 
causes an outpouring of a large quantity of mucus in the 
stomach, which greatly retards the digestion of other 
foods ; consequently, if taken at all, must be used in 
very small quantities. Dextrose and lactose are much 
less liable to be harmful. 

Fat in the form of butter is well borne ; cooked fat of 
meats, sauces, and pastries would better be avoided. 

Bread should be thoroughly toasted, that the starch 
may be dextrinized. Such vegetables as contain a small 
quantity of cellulose may be used, and they should be 
served in a finely divided state. Potato pur^e, chopped 



264 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

spinach, and cauliflower furnish excellent illastratians of 
yegetablea to be served to the sufferer of gastritis. 



DIIiATED BTOBCACH. 

Dilation of the stomach may be the result of a run- 
down condition of the system, when for some reason the 
walls of the stomach have become weakened, or the open- 
ing from the stomach to the duodenum has become smalL 
Whatever the cause, the result is the same, namely, the 
food remains in the stomach longer than it ought, giving 
rise to acetic, butyric, and lactic fermentation, and CO* 
gas is liberated. The large quantity of fermented food 
causes an excess of gastric juice. 

A striking example of a dilated stomach has been fur- 
nished by a woman who lost her right arm, and who ob- 
tained her livelihood by keeping a small store, from 
which fact her meals were often interrupted by custom- 
ers; consequently her food was poorly divided as well as 
improperly masticated. 

If the case is not a severe one, great relief may be ob- 
tained by taking thoroughly cooked food that will not 
ferment in small quantities, and finely dividing and 
masticating the same. Beside the three meals, three 
luncheons should be introduced each day. The use of 
water must be restricted. 

An hour's rest in a reclining position is necessary after 
each meal, and the patient should be so raised as to 
assist the food in its passage from the stomach. 

The temperature of foods must be considered in feeding 
the patient. All cold foods cause distress. 

In the treatment of all stomach troubles, it is necessary 
to consider the quantity of gastric juices poured out. 
Albumen, as found in eggs and milk, calls forth very 
little gastric juice, while fats call forth none. 

The washing out of the stomach once each day in 
severe cases seems imperative ; and this treatment needs 



DIET IN SPECUL DISEASES. 265 

to be followed for several months, or nntil such time as 
there is no appearance of undigested food in the withdrawn 
contents. 

In restricting the amount of water in the dietary, it 
may be necessary to inject salt and water by the rectum. 
If the patient suffers, no especial inconvenience, the 
amount of urine passed may drop from three pints, the 
usual daily amount^ to one pint

HOW TO ZHCRBJL8B BODT WHmHT, 

A fattening diet is called for under the following 
oonditions : — 

1. To store ap fat 

2. During oonvalescenoe after acute disease. 
8. In chronic wasting diseases. 

4. In some nervous diseases. 

There are many persons in apparent health who need 
to store up fat in order that they may be better fortified 
against disease, and that they may look better, not giv- 
ing the appearance of malnutrition. In order to aooom- 
plish this, rest and diet must be considered. 

When thin people have exercised freely, cut down the 
exercise as far as is practicable to increase body weight 
The three meals must be given regularly and luncheons 
introduced. A weekly gain of one pound is better than 
a more rapid increase. 

Experience has proved that milk is an excellent kind 
of food to use in the diet. Begin by taking two table- 
spoons at the close of each meal and between meals. The 
amount to be increased by the addition of one tablespoon 
at each daily serving until a glassful is consumed. Milk, 
when taken for luncheons, should be served with a small 
cracker. Milk should always be sipped rather than 
drunk, and fifteen minutes should be employed in taking 
a glassful. 

Fats in an easily digested form bum slowly, have the 
advantage of much nutriment in small bulk, and are easily 
stored in the system as fats. For these reasons they are 
highly recommended for the fattening process, though 
they must be considered as expensive forms of food. 
There is danger, however, if they are used to excess, of 
overtaxing the digestion ; therefore carbohydrates as well 
as fats must be well represented in the diet 

In general, carbohydrates are sufficiently used in the 
diet from the fact that most people have a natural crav- 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 267 

ing for sweets ; then again, both sngars and starches are 
inexpensive forms of food. 

Cream is a most acceptable form of fat, and is well 
borne and liked by most people. Like milk, it is well 
to introduce it gradually into the dietary, never aUowing 
the quantity to exceed one-half cup daily. Encourage a 
free use of butter, as it holds high place both as regards 
digestibility and as a fattening agent. Vegetables are 
the best known butter carriers. 

A salad served with an oil dressing should be found in 
the daily dietary. If olive oil does not prove an agreeable 
addition to salads, the oil may be taken by spoonful doses 
at the close of each meal to advantage, and even though 
not enjoyed may be tolerated and endured. 

Among the fats of meats, bacon fat is especially well 
liked. The fats of other meats have been probably 
sparingly eaten or ignored in the dietary of a thin 
person. 

It is always wise to consider the tastes of the patient 
as far as possible in introducing an excess of fat into the 
dietary. If an occasional change is made, less emphasis 
is laid upon its use. 

One, two, or three eggs may be introduced daily as 
liked. The yolks of eggs contain a considerable quantity 
of fat, and it must never be forgotten that eggs are a 
valuable proteid food. 

Fruits stimulate the appetite and are often acceptable 
when served with cream. Alcoholic stimulants should 
not be used; while beer and malt liquors are fattening 
their use would better be avoided except under the 
doctor's order. 



An excess of fat is almost invariably due to too much 
food with too little exercise. There are exceptional 
cases of obesity where only a moderate supply of food 
causes an excess of fat, but they are of less frequency 
than is usually supposed. Over-indulgence in diet is not 



268 FOOD AND OOOKBBT. 

aQOommon to thoee of large iocomes, and obesity asaallj 
follows, especially where little exercise is taken. It seems 
easy for such victims to deceive themselves as to the real 
caase of their complaint and attribute it to inberited 
tendencies. They generally assert ''it belongs to our 
family to be fat" Although some troth lies in this state- 
ment, a restricted diet, with sofficient exercise, mast exert 
a change in the right direction. 

To treat obesity there must be a reduction in the 
amount of food or an increase in the amount of work, 
and sometimes both these considerations need play a part. 
It has been found safer to cut down the number of 
calories given rather than to restrict the use of any 
especial class of foods ; but do not introduce too large a 
variety or serve foods of which the patient is especially 
fond. 

A patient is quite likely to suffer from weakness and 
faintness when there is a loss of flesh occasioned by the 
cutting down of the food supply. These symptoms are 
overcome partially if, besides the three meals, three 
luncheons are introduced. 

In reducing the food supply, see to it that the proteins 
(tissue-building foods) are in sufficient quantity to keep 
up the strength of the patient Van Noorden asserts that 
one hundred and fifty-five grams of albumen should be 
taken daUy. Lean meat appeases hunger more than fish. 

It is desirable to cut off the fat in meats and avoid all 
kinds of fat meat and restrict the use of milk, except 
the small quantity that may be used with tea or coffee. 
Buttermilk, if liked, is a desirable beverage. 

Both sugars and starches should be used sparingly; 
therefore the supply of bread, potatoes, and cereals 
during periods of diet should be cut down to a very 
limited supply, while sweet desserts would better be 
avoided. 

Fruits and vegetables, being bulky foods, are well used 
with meats and ^gs, which are concentrated foods. 

Water, saline waters, tea, and coffee are allowed as

beverages if taken in moderation* Alcohol should be 
avoided, but in cases of weak heart-action it is sometimes 
necessary to resort to its use ; then whiskey may be taken 
in teaspoon doses; also some wines containing a small 
percentage of sugar* Strong, sweet wines, liqueurs, and 
malt liquors should not be allowed. 

After all is said and done, experience has shown that 
no stated rules can be laid down for the treatment of the 
over-fat. Individual cases call for individual diets. In 
some it seems well to cut down the fats more than any 
other class of foods ; in others, the carbohydrates. It is a 
safe statement to make that the number of calories should 
be decreased about one-fifth from the standard to bring 
about the best results, which is a loss of body weight of 
about one-half pound weekly. In extreme cases the cal- 
ories are cut two-fifths with satisfying results, but with 
greater loss of body weights. When such a diet is re- 
sorted to it would better be adhered to for about one 
month, then a return made to a normal diet, followed by 
another period of restricted diet 

When obesity is accompanied by heart trouble, then the 
greatest care must be taken as regards the food supply, 
and the patient's symptoms must be carefully watched. 

TTPHOID FBVSR. 

Typhoid fever is a germ disease, infectious while not 
oonUigious, located in the small intestines. It is not 
possible to contract typhoid by contact with the patient, 
but danger lies from contact with the feeces ; therefore 
too much stress cannot be laid upon the immediate disin- 
fection and disposal of the same. 

Typhoid is largely attributable to an impure milk or 
water supply, while cases are recorded from the eating of 
raw oysters which have been contaminated from sewage 
which contained typhoid bacillL 

If a physician were asked off-hand what he would rec- 
ommend for the feeding of a typhoid patient, he would 
say, most likely, feed the patient to the limit of his 



270 FOOD AND COOKERY. 

digestive capacity, which may be determined by tiie 
condition of his stools. 

No amount of food given to a fever patient is capable 
of establishing nitrogenoos equilibrium, as there is sach 
a rapid destruction of nitrogenous tissues. The micro- 
organisms which produce typhoid have a marked destroy- 
ing influence on the protein constituents of the body. 
From this statement one might draw the deduction that a 
large supply of protein food should be furnished, bat this 
would add to the waste products, which are already ex- 
cessive, thus overtaxing the kidneys, which would be 
harmful rather than beneficial. Tissue-sparing foods 
may be liberally supplied in the diet in a carbohydrate 
form, as fats usually prove repugnant to a fever patient. 
Gelatin, although classed under proteids, is valuable^ 
principally, as a proteid sparer, although its final prod- 
ucts are similar to the final products of all proteids. 

During the last few years an exclusive milk diet has 
been used by many physicians and in almost all hospitals^ 
but the best authorities are now agreed that while milk 
should furnish the principal article of diet, other foods 
may be introduced advantageously, namely: Koumiss, 
Junket, orange albumen, strained oatmeal and wheat 
gruels, chicken and mutton broth, soft-cooked eggs, 
bread. Jellies, ice cream, and in some cases a small piece 
of broiled beefsteak or breast of chicken is allowed. 

Typhoid patients always require frequent feedings, — 
usually every two hours during the day and several times 
during the night There is a craving for cold water, which 
may be gratified, but it is best to restrict the quantity 
at any one tune. Fruit beverages may be indulged in 
freely, as much water is ingested by their use. They are 
often fortified by the use of lactose for sweetening. Lac- 
tose has advantages over cane sugar, as it is less sweet 
to the taste, and under ordinary conditions does not 
ferment. 

When a strictly milk diet is depended upon, there is 
great danger of under-feeding the patient. The amount 
should never fall below three pints daily, and two quarts 



DIET IN SPECIAL DISEASES. 271 

is asnally coDBidered neceesary. When milk is dilated 
with alkaline or effervescent waters, to make it more pal- 
atable or more easily digested, it must be remembered 
that its nutritive value is greatly diminished, a fact often 
overlooked by those caring for the sick. Koumiss is a 
form of milk which is well borne by typhoid patients. 

To make a liquid or semi-liquid diet bearable for any 
length of time without destroying all desire for food, it is 
necessary to offer as much variety as possible, and for this 
reason chicken and mutton broth are given to stimulate 
appetite rather than for their food value. Beef tea should 
never be allowed, as the extractives of beef are liable to 
excite diarrhoea, which, above all symptoms, is to be 
avoided. 

STANDARD DZBT. 

Milk, 1500 CO. (8 pints). 
Cream, 500 to 1000 0.0.

Eggs, 8 to 6. 



In the dietetic treatment of rheumatism physicians 
differ greatly, but on one point they seem agreed, 
namely: That a moderate diet of well-cooked simple food 
must be enforced. Much out-of-door life is strongly 
recommended, with moderate exercise, and cold-water 
baths are usually found to be beneficial. 

Foods rich in extractives are avoided, also tea, coffee, 
and alcohol in all its forms. Beef is considered more 
stimulating than lamb or chicken, and is excluded from 
the dietary. Sweetbreads give rise to uric acid in the 
system, therefore they must be condemned by the sufferer 
from rheumatism. 

Cereals, milk, eggs, fresh fruit, and vegetables should 
form the principal part of the diet, and above aU, good 
eating habits should be established, which consist of 
regularity of meals as well as a sufficient time for eating 
the same. Late suppers always should be avoided.

Bright* 8 disease is a disease of the kidneys, and « 
reoognized by the persistent presence of albamen in tto 
nrine, and the wasting of the affected organ. Brighf a 
disease may be acute or chronic, and in either case rest 
the organ as far as possible. This may be accomplished 
by avoiding work or irritants for the kidney. The physi- 
cian recognizes the fact that the kidney is but a small 
part of the body, therefore does not forget to consider 
the body as a whole, and especially the heart, as that 
organ is overtaxed. 

In acute cases of Brighf s disease the use of water is 
restricted to a moderate supply, one pint to two quarts 
daily. Formerly, in chronic cases, water was given freely, 
with the thought that thereby waste products might be 
more readily ezlicreted. Van Noorden claims that waste 
products are excreted quite as well in a small as in a 
large quantity of urine, and his theory is verified by other 
noted authorities. 

A milk diet, in extreme cases, was formerly considered 
a safe one to follow. At the present time it is looked 
upon with suspicion, and the amount given should not ex- 
ceed a quart. Van Noorden asserts that too much albu- 
men is given if more than that quantity is allowed, a 
theory now adopted by the leading physicians of our own 
country. 

Albumen, in acute cases, for a time must be restricted, 
but as the disease becomes chronic care must be taken 
that the supply is sufficient for the needs of the body. 
From whatever source albumen is supplied its effect upon 
the urine is identical. 

While it has not been proved that meats are distinctly 
harmful, the quantity in the diet is of necessity restricted, 
on account of the albumen they contain. 

White meats are preferable to red meats, only because 
a smaller quantity is usually desired. 

Eggs, vegetables free from albumen (e. g. potatoes,

rice), and f raits, being deficient in eztractiTes, forniBh 
desirable foods for the sufferer from Bright's disease. 
Fats ma; also be given. In chronic cases the amount 
of albnmen given daily should not fall below forty-five 
grams, and as a rule from sixty to one-hundred grams are 
furnished. 

Among condiments salt may be used only very spar- 
ingly (five grams in twenty-four hours), since the kidneys 
do not excrete it well If it accumulates it increases 
the amount of water in the body.

Heart disease is of two distinct types, — muscular and 
valvular. If the heart muscle is all right, the valve may 
be troublesome, yet not give much annoyance ; but if the 
heart muscle is weak, a leaky valve becomes more trouble- 
some. In cases of weakened heart muscle the organ may 
J[)e dilated to twice its normal size. Foods play a mu<^ 
more important part than drugs in the treatment of heart 
disease. Give small quantities, always remembering that 
there is but one-fourth inch in thickness between the 
heart and the stomach and pressure upon the heart is 
dangerous. Such pressure takes place where death, it is 
said, is due to heart failure. Avoid such foods as stima-

It is frequently the case that the illy nourished fall 
yictims to phthisis, and the danger is increased if one 
has inherited tendencies to the disease. Statistics show 
that the death rate from phthisis is alarmingly large, and 
it might be materially lessened, and in a few years eradi- 
cated, if the strictest attention was paid to the burning 
of all sputum. 

On account of the great destruction of tissues in the 
consumptiye, there should be given a generous supply 
of tissue-forming foods. The rations should be of such 
a character that they may be easily digested, and they 
should be given at regular, frequent intervals. Besides 
breakfast, dinner, and supper, there should be a luncheon 
in the morning, another in the afternoon, and still another 
before retiring. 

Hygienic surroundings and an ample supply of fresh 
air play as important a part in the treatment as the food 
supply. The good results obtained at the various sanita- 
riums are largely due to the fact that these important 
considerations have not been overlooked. 

At Butland, Massachusetts, where many patients have 
derived much benefit, the open-air treatment is used, and 
all alcoholic stimulants are withheld unless especially or- 
dered by the physician. It must be mentioned, however, 
that only such patients are admitted as are suffering from 
the first stages of the disease. 

The patients are warmly clad both night and day. 
During the day most of the time is spent out of doors,

and some patients even sleep oat of doors, and when not 
out of doors in a cold room constantly supplied with 
fresh air. Hoods, mittens, and moccasins are necessary 
as a protection in such an outof-door life, and blankets 
are supplied almost without number. 

Patients are allowed a warm room for the cold-water 
baths, which are recommended, and also for dressing, 
after which time the heat is turned off, not to be tamed 
on again until time to heat the rooms for undressing. 

Under this treatment a weekly gain of weight always is 
looked for, and patients are weighed at regular intervals 
that the increase may be recorded. The exercise is lim- 
ited, to assist in accomplishing this gain, while the food 
supply is greatly in excess of that furnished for a person 
in health. 

Many physicians are wont to send patients to the far 
West (Colorado or California), and while some have 
derived benefit from the change, alas, the greater number 
have been too wasted by the disease to receive permanent 
good. 

Consumption being an infectious disease, it is never 
wise to have a large number of cases in a single colony. 
Where large numbers have flocked to localities where the 
disease has been unknown, the cases have so multiplied 
that the error of the plan has been made apparent. 

Many patients who make a change of climate (select- 
ing a spot where the elevation is high and the air dry) 
during the early stages of the disease, are so benefited 
as to be able to return without suffering materially from 
the change ; while others find it necessay^y to remain for 
the rest of their lives, except, perhaps, for short vacation 
trips. 

Specialists of phthisis are agreed in believing that the 
most gratifying results come from 

1. A treatment of the disease in its first stages. 

2. A high and dry climate. 

8. A liberal supply of fresh cold air. 

4. Daily morning cold-water baths (when possible).

Fats, in the form of cream, butter, olive oil, bacon, 
and fat of beef, are most important in the dietary of 
the consumptive, their caloric value being great in pro- 
portion to their bulk. 

Among protein foods, eggs play a very important part, 
as they are acceptable when raw, or may be cooked in a 
great variety of ways, either alone or in combination 
with other food materials. Many physicians advise giv- 
ing a large number of eggs, and cases are recorded where 
a patient has taken eighteen in a day, beginning with 
three, and adding one egg each day until this maximum 
is reached. While patients have gained on such a diet, 
there are some objections to its use. Patients usually 
tire of eggs when taken in such large numbers; then, 
again, being less completely digested than when taken in 
small numbers, the use of a cathartic is imperative. 

Among meats beef holds first place, principally due to 
the fact that patients tire of it less quickly. The fat of 
beef is more easily digested than the fat of mutton, 
which among meats holds second place. Lamb, chicken, 
poultry, and game, all are introduced into the diet 
Milk may be taken at the close of a meal, or between 
meals with a biscuit. There are few foods which need 
be excluded in feeding phthisis patients. It is a fact 
to be remembered, however, that when an excess of 
fat is taken the supply of carbohydrates should be 
diminished. 

When digestion becomes impaired by the stuffing 
process, oftentimes the use of some alcoholic stimulant 
will be found of great help as an aid to better digestion.

THE TELLOW FACKAGE 



COMES 

IS the origi 
package, a 

(Hlue package). Both packages con- 
Li. n two envelopes of gelatine and pinic 
color in a separal* envelope, and make 
Ih ! same quantity — two quarts. The 
ily difference between the two is that 
th^ Acidulated package contains an 
extra envelope of lemon fiavor, which 
tAkes the place of lemon juice. 
K40X Gelatine is a plain, straight 
p'wiuct, and the flavoring and coloring 
^ packed separately in each package, 
and not mixai with the gelatine to hide 
odors or other defects. Toinsure themakingof attractive, health- 
ful and appetizing gelatine dishes for the sick and convalescent, 
one should use plain Granulated gelatine and add pure flavors, 
sweetening, seasonable fruits, etc. The juice from canned frtiits 
makes a pajticularly pleasing and appetising color. 
CtUuine Dishes are taking an important part in dietetics, and 
physicians are ordering it very largely in the diet of their patients 
while treating many diseases. The careful practitioner, however, 
recommends only a wholesome, colorless, odorless and tasteless 
gelatine, which is found in 

Knox Sparkling Gelatine 
Knox Acidulated Gelatine 

A great sunlit factory equipped with ^ 
especially designed machinery does 
all the work of Knox Gelatine — 
hands never touch it until the house- 
wife herself opens the package.

Serving 

The serving of food in a 
dainty, appetizing way is very 
nearly as essential as to have 
it pure and properly cooked, to 
appeal to a sick person. 

We keep an extensive assort- 
ment of moulds, cutters, rami- 
kins, casseroles and the various 
utensils used in preparing at- 
tractive dishes. 

We also have white enamel 
surgical goods, such as bed 
pans, pus pans, bandage pails, 
solution basins, and other 
hospital supplies.

A NOURISHING AND 
COOLING DRINK 

FOR THE SICK 

ft 

In convalescence, for weakness, nervous- 
ness or feverish conditions, Horsford's 
Acid Phosphate is safer, more palatable 
and more beneficial than lemonade or lime 
juice. 

Horsford's 

Acid Phosphate 

contains valuable nutrients — phosphates of 
calcium, sodium, magnesium and iron. It 
is, therefore, far superior to Dilute Phos- 
phoric or other acids. 

It is recommended especially for promot- 
ing digestion, strengthening the nervous sys- 
tem, and in wasting diseases. 

A teaspoonful in a glass of cold water 
makes a most grateful beverage. 

Nurses and physicians please write for 

free samples.

up-to-date kitchen. They are used in all my 
class-rooms, and are recommended in special, 
class, and demonstration work.

MAGIC COFRRS. JTHAT ARE THE Tf 
The greatest invention of the age 1 A great 
saving of time, strength, and material. Neat, 
durable, and effectual. Every housekeeper should 
have one. By their use the softest dough can be 
handled without the slightest possibility of sticking 
to moulding board or rolling pin. They are 
guaranteed to be absolutely as represented. One 
set will last for years. They will save many times 
thdr coat in material alone. They are highly 
recommended by leading cooks and teachers of 
cooking. Dough cannot stick to Magic Covtrs,

The Covers are better than I imagined. 
The very poetry of pastry work.

The class has used my coven and the ladies 
all want them. One trial will sell a Magic 
Cover. I am sure I can sell five or six dozen.

Preserved in Oil 



j4N eminent member of 
/% the Massachusetts Bar 
JL. .A. wrote us, *' I want more 
of the photographs showing a 
lawyer with his hand in his own 
pocket. It may be an unusual 
pose, but my friends tell me it's 
a capital likeness and otherwise 
worthy of being preserved in 
oil." 

If photographs of this kind 
appeal to you, the kind worthy 
of being preserved (in oil or 
otherwise), then surely you 
ought to take advantage of our 
skill and experience.
