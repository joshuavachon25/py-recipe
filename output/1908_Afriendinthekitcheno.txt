THE ART OF ARTS 

Some maids are gifted with the art 
Of painting like the masters; 

To dullest canvas they impart 
The freshness of the pastures. 

While others, with their ready pen, 
Find hours of busy pleasure 

In polished prose, or then, again, 
In light poetic measure. 

Another, like a woodland bird, 
May set the sad world ringing 

With carols sweet as ever heard; 
Here is the art of singing. 

But there's a maid and there's an art 
To which the world is looking, — 

The nearest art unto the heart, — 
The good old art of cooking. 

— Selected.

The object of this work is to furnish in an inexpensive 
and convenient form, plain directions on healthful cookery. 
Special attention has been given to"'the idea of presenting 
such recipes as will tend to make the living of the family 
what it should be, — simple, economical, wholesome, nutri- 
tious, palatable, and varied. 

The housewife is often perplexed to know just what to 
- cook ; but if she has at hand something which will suggest 
to her what she desires but can not think of, she has that 
which is indeed a friend. 

The author has tried to make the work sufficiently 
comprehensive to answer the demands of an ordinary 
household. 

The recipes for the preparation of grains, fruits, nuts, 
and vegetables occupy a large portion of the work. Cream 
is mentioned in a number of the recipes, but while its use 
is to be preferred instead of butter, especially if sterilized, 
substitutes have generally been suggested where it is not 
at hand or available. 

Pains have been taken to make the recipes plain and 
explicit, and yet as brief as possible consistent with these 
ends. The amount of the various ingredients required 
has generally been indicated by measure, rather than by 
weight, as this is usually more convenient and time-saving. 

It is hoped that this little work will be found to be a 
real friend in the kitchen. That it may be such, and that 
it may prove a blessing to thousands in many lands, is the 
sincere wish of — The Author. 




IMPORTANCE OF GOOD COOKING 

HEALTHFUL cookery is not receiving the attention 
which its importance demands. Although we are 
living at a time when eating and drinking are carried to 
excess, and when elaborate bills of fare are frequently- 
placed before us, yet plain, simple, and healthful cookery 
occupies but a comparatively small place in the culinary 
world to-day. 

Good food is of primary importance. We live upon 
what we eat. It is not sufficient, however, merely to select 
good food. To be well digested and thoroughly assimilated 
the food must be properly prepared. The best food may 
be spoiled in cooking. The kind of food upon which we 
live, and the manner in which it is prepared, determines 
la'rgely our physical well-being, and consequently much of 
our happiness or misery in this life. 

" For love, nor honor, wealth, nor power, 
Can give the heart a cheerful hour 
When health is lost. Be timely wise; 
With health all taste of pleasure flies." 

Moreover, the mind is affected by the condition of the 
body, and the morals by the state of the mind. As, there- 
fore, cooking determines to a large degree the condition 
of the body, it must also affect to a considerable extent 
our moral and spiritual welfare. It is not too much to 
say, therefore, that there is religion in good cooking. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 5 

It has been truly said that " the cook fills an important 
place in the household. She is preparing food to be taken 
into the stomach, to form brain, bone, and muscle. The 
health of all the members of the family depends largely 
upon her skill and intelligence." As the lives of those on 
a steamship are in the hands of the helmsman, so the lives 
and the health of the members of the family are, to a great 
degree, in the hands of the one who prepares their meals. 

Thousands are dying annually as the result of poor 
cooking. Food poorly prepared is not nutritious, and can 
not, therefore, make good blood. 

Some may say they have no natural ability to cook ; 
but any one having ordinary intelligence, with a little 
effort, care, and proper directions, can learn to cook well. 
And surely the health of the family ought to be of suffi- 
cient importance to inspire every mother with ambition to 
learn how to cook. 

Mothers should also teach their daughters the mysteries 
of good cooking. They should show them that this is an 
essential part of their education, — more essential than the 
study of music, fancy work, the dead languages, or the 
sciences. The knowledge of these latter without the knowl- 
edge of how to care for the body and provide it with suit- 
able nourishment, is of little worth. Meredith hit upon a 
great truth when he said: — 

"We may live without music, poetry, and art; 
We may live without conscience, and live without heart. 
We may live without friends; we may live without books; 
But civilized man can not live without cooks." 

No young woman should contemplate marriage until 
she has first acquired a practical knowledge of simple 
cookery, for this is essential, whether she expects to do 
the cooking herself, or supervise the maid. Although bread 
is the staff of life, it is a sad fact that a large proportion 



A Friend in the Kitchen 



of the daughters of the present generation do not know 
how to make a good loaf of bread. They have not been 
instructed in the useful art of cookery, so that when they 
have families of their own they can provide for their tables 
a well-cooked dinner, prepared with nicety, so that they 
would not blush " to place it before their most esteemed 
friends. 

There has never been an age so noted for dyspeptics as 
the present, and there was perhaps never before a time 
when there was a greater scarcity of good cooks. 

" Though we boast of modern progress as aloft we proudly soar 
Above untutored cannibals whose habits we deplore, 
Yet in our daily papers any day you chance to look 
You may find this advertisement: 'Wanted — A Girl to Cook.'" 

Good cooking does not consist in the preparation of 
highly seasoned foods to pamper a perverted appetite, 
but in cooking with simplicity, variety, and skill natural 
foods in a palatable and wholesome manner. To assist in 
this direction is the object of this little work. 

But no workman can work without materials and tools. 
The necessary materials for cooking are indicated in the 
recipes given in this book. Illustrations of many of the 
most necessary and useful cooking utensils will be found 
scattered throughout the work. 

A very convenient and easily constructed wall rack, 
which may be placed over the kitchen work table, is shown 
in the following cut : 





O hour of all hours, the most pleasant on earth, 
Happy hour of our dinners ! — Meredith. • 

Soup rejoices the stomach, and disposes it to receive and 
digest other food. — Brillat Savavin. 

It is important that we relish the food we eat. — Christian 
Temperance. 

V^ ^ ^ 

SOUP is easily prepared, economical, and when made 
from healthful materials, is a very wholesome article 
of diet. It adds much to the elegance and relish of a 
dinner, and, if taken in small quantities, is a good means 
of preparing the whole system to assirhilate a hearty meal. 

Soups afford an excellent opportunity for using left-over 
foods which might otherwise be wasted. A combination 
of vegetables left over from the previous day, such as a 
cupful of mashed potatoes, some stewed peas, beans, or 
lentils, a few spoonfuls of boiled rice, stewed tomatoes, or 
other bits of vegetables or grains, if in good order, make a 
very palatable and nourishing soup. The vegetables should 
be put all together in a saucepan with enough water to 
cover them, let simmer for an hour or two, then rubbed 
through a colander, and returned to the saucepan with 
sufficient water added to make the soup of proper con- 
sistency, reheated, seasoned, and served. 

For seasoning soup, a few spoonfuls of cream, or a 

7

little butter or nut butter may be used, though, if properly 
made, it is quite relishable without. 

We wish all our readers success with the following 
simple but delicious kinds. 

U? )^ )g 

BEAN SOUP 

For two quarts of soup soak one pint of beans overnight. In 
the morning drain, and put to cook in cold water, adding one- 
third cup of well-washed rice if desired; boil slowly for about 
two hours. When done, rub through a colander, thin with 
boiling water, and season with a little butter and salt. 

POTATO SOUP 

Pare and slice three medium-sized potatoes, and put to cook 
with a tablespoonful of chopped onion, or stalk of celery 
chopped fine, in sufficient water to cover. If celery is not at 
hand, one-half teaspoonful of celery salt may be used instead. 
Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan over the fire, 
then add two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir well, and cook one 
minute; then add gradually one quart of milk, stirring con- 
stantly until thickened. Simmer for ten minutes. As soon as 
the potatoes are done, and the water nearly absorbed, rub, 
without draining, through a colander, and add them to the hot, 
thickened milk. Season with salt, and serve. 

GREEN PEA SOUP 

Add to a quart of green peas a teaspoonful of sugar and 
enough water to cover; cook gently until tender, and the water 
quite absorbed. Then rub through a colander, add a quart of 
milk, salt to taste, and return to the fire. Heat to boiling, then 
add a spoonful of flour, mixed smooth with a little butter, then 
to a thin paste with a little of the soup. Simmer for a few min- 
utes, and serve with croutons. If desired, a little onion or 
celery may be added for seasoning during the last few minutes 
of cooking, and then be removed. 

SPLIT PEA SOUP 

Wash one cupful of dried, split peas, and soak for several 
hours, or overnight, in cold water. Then put to cook in three 
pints of cold water, and boil slowly until thoroughly dissolved, 
adding more water occasionally to keep the quantity good. 
Stir up frequently from the bottom of the kettle. Rub through 
a colander; add water or rich milk to make the proper consist- 
ency, and return to the fire. Brown slightly one tablespoonful 
of flour in a tablespoonful of butter or cooking oil, then thin it 



A Friend in the Kitchen 9 

with a few spoonfuls of the hot soup; stir this into the boiling 
soup, with salt to taste; simmer for ten minutes, and serve. An 
onion chopped fine and browned with the flour may be used for 
seasoning; also a cupful of tomatoes may be cooked with the 
peas before straining, if desired. 

SPLIT PEA AND VERMICELLI SOUP 

Make the soup as above. Cook one-half cup of vermicelli 
in a cupful of boiling water for ten minutes and add to the soup. 

TOMATO SOUP 

Put a quart can of tomatoes in a porcelain stewpan, add a 
pint of water, and stew until well done. Brown lightly in a 
frying-pan a tablespoonful of finely chopped onion in a table- 
spoonful of butter or cooking oil; then mix in a tablespoonful 
of flour or cornstarch; thin this with a little of the soup, and 
then stir it into the soup. Simmer for ten minutes, run through 
a colander, reheat, add salt to taste, and serve hot with croutons. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP 

Take two cupfuls of canned or fresh tomatoes, add a cupful 
of water, one teaspoonful of minced onion, and, if desired, a 
little chopped celery; stew till tender, then rub through a col- 
ander. Heat one quart of milk to boiling. Have mixed smooth 
one tablespoonful of butter and one level tablespoonful of flour, 
then thin with a little of the hot milk. Stir this into the milk 
as soon as it starts to boil, and cook for several minutes, adding 
salt to taste. Then add the tomatoes. Do not cook or let stand 
after the tomatoes are added, but serve at once. 

LENTIL SOUP 

Cook one cupful of lentils, previously soaked an hour or two 
in about a quart of water, until tender. Rub through a colander; 
return to the fire, adding enough boiling water to make a quart 
in all, a small onion cut in slices, and salt to taste. When heated 
to boiling, thicken to the consistency of cream with browned 
flour. Season with a little butter or a few spoonfuls of sweet 
cream. If butter is used it should be mixed or braided with 
the flour, then thinned with enough of the soup so that it can 
be easily poured in. Simmer for ten minutes after adding the 
flour. Remove the onion before serving. The German or dark 
lentils are usually cheaper than the Egyptian or red lentils. 

LENTIL AND TOMATO SOUP 

Soak one cupful of lentils in cold water for a few hours, then 
cook in a quart of water until tender, with one small onion, 
three or four fresh tomatoes, or two cupfuls of stewed ones, 
and a tablespoonful of nut butter, if desired. Rub through a 
colander, add hot water to make three pints in all, reheat to 



10 A Friend in the Kitchen 

boiling, and slightly thicken with a spoonful of browned flour 
mixed with a little cold water. Season with a small lump of 
butter or a few spoonfuls of cream. 

TOMATO AND MACARONI SOUP 

Drop a cupful of macaroni broken into small pieces into 
three or four cupfuls of boiling, slightly salted, water; boil 
from thirty to sixty minutes, or until tender, the length of 
time required depending upon whether the macaroni is fresh 
or stale. Have stewing one quart of fresh or canned tomatoes, 
and when done, rub through a colander; drain the macaroni, 
and add it to the tomatoes, with hot water to make about three 
pints in all. Reheat, season with salt and a little butter, and, 
after removing from the fire, add a few spoonfuls of sweet 
cream if convenient. Serve as soon as the cream is added. 

RICE SOUP 

Wash one-third cup of rice and put to cook in about three 
cupfuls of water, adding a little salt; cook until tender. Then 
add one quart of milk, and salt to taste; reheat to boiling. Have 
ready a tablespoonful of butter mixed smooth with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour, then made thin with a little of the hot milk; pour 
this into the soup and simmer for ten minutes. Celery may be 
added for flavoring if desired. Also, if desired richer, a beaten 
yolk of egg, first mixed with a few spoonfuls of the hot soup 
to prevent coagulating, may be added to the soup a few min- 
utes before serving. 

SAGO PEA SOUP 

Wash, soak, and cook one cupful of split peas in plenty of 
water until tender; rub through a colander, return to the fire, 
adding enough hot water to make three pints in all, and a few 
slices of onion. Wash three tablespoonfuls of sago in warm 
water, and stir gradually into the soup; simmer for a half-hour, 
or. until well dissolved. Remove the onion, and season with 
salt. Add a few spoonfuls of thin cream or rich milk to the 
beaten yolk of an egg, and stir into the soup a few minutes 
before serving. 

SAGO FRUIT SOUP (SUMMER) 

Soak one-half cup of sago for an hour in a cup of cold water; 
then add a quart of hot water, and simmer until transparent. 
In the meantime cook together one cup of prunes and one-half 
cup of raisins in a small quantity of water. When the sago is 
transparent, add the fruit, together with one-half cup of curiant, 
plum, or some other tart fruit juice, and one-half cup of sugar. 
This will make three pints of soup. Serve hot with croutons. 

Instead of the above, rice with dried apricots, and prune or 
currant juice may be used. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 11 

VEGETABLE SOUP (SUMMER) 

Take a cupful each of chopped turnips, carrots, cauliflower 
or cabbage, several young onions cut fine, one cupful of green 
peas, one tablespoonful parsley or bay leaves for flavoring, and 
stew together in a stewpan with water to cover for six or eight 
minutes; then drain, cover with fresh boiling water, and stew 
slowly until tender, and the water nearly absorbed. Strain 
through a colander. Add enough hot rich milk or cream to 
make quite thin, salt to taste, reheat, and serve. 

VEGETABLE SOUP (WINTER) 

Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a stewpan or soup 
kettle, add one onion chopped fine, and brown nicely; stir fre- 
quently to prevent burning. To this add a tablespoonful of 
flour, mix thoroughly, then pour in slowly a pint of hot water, 
stirring to keep smooth. Add to this one-half cupful each of 
chopped carrots, turnips, and celery, one cupful of tomatoes, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of chopped or powdered 
parsley, bay leaves or thyme, and a slice of bread toasted very 
brown. Boil two potatoes for ten minutes, drain, and add them 
to the soup. Simmer all till well done, run through a colander, 
add hot water to make of proper consistency, a little more salt 
if desired, and serve hot. 

VEGETABLE SOUP STOCK 

Put into a kettle one quart of tomatoes, three pints of 
water, and place over the fire; add one onion, one or two pared 
potatoes, and one carrot, all finely chopped, one teaspoonful of 
celery salt, two bay leaves, and cook slowly for one hour. Run 
through a colander, and add salt to taste. Add to this cooked 
macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli, corn, or rice. 

BARLEY SOUP 

Cook a cupful of pearl barley in three pints of water for 
several hours, adding water as needed to keep the quantity 
good. When done, add salt and a little cream, or the beaten 
yolk of an egg. 

NOODLE SOUP 

Beat the yolks of two eggs thoroughly, then add one cup of 
sifted flour, and knead well for five or ten minutes; divide into 
four parts, roll each part nearly as thin as a knife blade, and 
place on a clean cloth near the fire to dry. When dried suffi- 
ciently so that they will not stick together when rolled up, or 
be so dry as to be brittle, roll each piece up into a roll, and 
with a sharp knife- cut or shave crosswise into very narrow 
slices, about one-twelfth of an inch in width. Shake out well, 
and let dry thoroughly. Then drop into hot salted water, and 
boil twenty minutes; drain off the water well, add a quart of 



12 A Friend in the Kitchen 

milk, salt to taste, reheat, and serve. Noodles may be added 
to other soups instead of macaroni. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP 

Take two bundles of fresh, tender asparagus, wash, cut into 
short lengths, and put to cook in a quart of hot water. Let 
cook slowly till tender, and the water reduced one-half; rub 
through a colander, add three cups of milk, a spoonful or two 
of cream, and salt to taste. Let heat to boiling, and serve with 
croutons. A half cup of well-cooked rice may be stirred into 
the soup before serving if desired. 

FOUNDATION FOR CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Rub one tablespoonful each of butter and flour to a cream, 
then slowly pour into it one quart of boiling milk, stirring well. 
Allow to thicken, add salt to taste, and the seasoning and 
ingredients, as canned corn, peas, celery, asparagus, salsify, etc., 
desired for the soup. To make the soup richer, a beaten egg, 
or a few spoonfuls of cream may be put into the tureen before 
turning in the soup. 

CROUTONS FOR SOUP 

Cut bread into small cubes from one-half inch to an inch 
square, and brown in a moderate oven. A spoonful or two of 
the croutons may be placed in each plate, and the hot soup 
turned over them, or placed in a dish on the table for use as 
desired. 

BROWNED FLOUR FOR SOUPS 

Spread a small quantity of flour on shallow tins, and brown 
lightly in a moderately hot oven; stir often enough to prevent 
any part from scorching. A quantity may be prepared and put 
away in covered jars for use. 

SEASONING FOR SOUPS 

Ground nuts with herbs, dried and powdered nicely, flavor 
and enrich vegetable soups, gravies, and sauces. 

HERBS FOR SOUPS 

Herbs, such as bay leaves, parsley, thyme, etc., are valuable 
for flavoring soups, savories, and gravies. They can be obtained 
at a druggists, and a few cents' worth will last a long time. 




" O stay me with rice and with porridge 
O comfort me sweetly with grits! 
Baked beans give me plenty of courage. 
And cracked wheat enlivens my wits." 
No one should adopt an impoverished diet. 
Bring me my breakfast — oatmeal and boiled eggs. — A. T. 
Stewart, the millionaire. 

Carlyle, catching a glimpse of Macaulay's face, once re- 
marked, "Well, any one can see that you are an honest, good 
sort of a fellow, made out of oatmeal." 

Dr. Johnson, who entertained a great dislike for the Scots, 
and lost no opportunity of saying bitter things against them, 
once defined oats as "in Scotland food for Scotchmen; but in 
England, food for horses." He was well answered by the indig- 
nant Scotchman, who replied, " Yes, and where can you find 
such men as in Scotland, or such horses as in England?" 

^a )^ ^ 

MOST grains require prolonged cooking, and slow 
cooking is preferable to fast. They are frequently 
served in the form of mush, and too often in an under- 
done state. Thorough cooking not only breaks up the 
food, but partially digests the starch contained in it. 

Salt should be added to the water before stirring in the 
grain or meal. 

All grains and meals should be put into actively boil-, 
ing water to prevent them from having a raw taste, and 
allowed to boil fast until they " set," or thicken, and cease 
sinking to the bottom; till then they should be stirred fre- 
quently, but gently, to prevent burning. After the grain has 
thickened, it should be stirred very little, or none at all. 

13 




14 A Friend in the Kitchen 

Enough grain or meal should be used to make the 
mush quite thick and glutinous when done. Watery or 
sloppy mush is neither palatable nor strengthening to the 
digestive organs when used constantly. In fact, it should 
not be considered necessary to have mush every morning. 
A change occasionally to drier foods 
is better for the digestion. 

An excellent utensil for cooking 
grains is a milk or mush boiler, 
generally called a double boiler. 
This consists of one vessel set inside 
of another, the inner one containing 

Double Boiler ^^^ ^^^^" ^° ^^ cooked, the other 

partly filled with boiling water. An 
ordinary saucepan, however, will do very well, if smooth, 
and by greasing the inside with a little butter before putting 
in the water, the tendency of the grain to adhere to the 
saucepan will be greatly obviated. 

If a double boiler is used, allow the grain to boil in 
the. inner vessel standing directly over the range until it 
" sets," then cover and place in the outer vessel, the water 
in which must also be boiling in order that the c.ooking 
process be not checked ; then leave to cook slowly until done. 
From three to four hours is not too long when the double 
boiler is used. Grain prepared in this way may be cooked 
on the previous day and simply warmed up again the next 
morning for breakfast. What is left over from any meal 
may be used in the next preparation. 

If a hastily prepared mush is required, perhaps nothing 
better than the rolled oats can be employed, these requiring 
not more than half an hour's cooking, as they are already 
partially cooked in their manufacture ; but even these are 
improved by longer cooking in a double boiler. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 15 

It is very important, when making any kind of mush, 
that the water be boiHng rapidly, and kept thus while stirring 
in the meal; for unless the grain or meal is thoroughly 
scalded when stirred in, not even prolonged cooking will 
take away the raw taste. 

)^ «* «« 

OATMEAL MUSH 

To a quart of boiling water add a pinch of salt, 
sprinkle in a cupful of oatmeal, and boil rapidly 
for about ten minutes, or until it sets, stirring 
frequently with a fork. Then place over the hot 
water in the lower boiler and cook from one to 
three hours. Just before serving, remove the 
cover and stir lightly with a fork to allow the 
steam to escape. This makes the mush more dry. q , 
Serve with baked apples, cream, fresh fruit, or ji;i " 
with the juice from stewed fruit. Oatmeal is measure 
richer in nitrogen than any other grain, and therefore very 
nutritious. But to be wholesome it must be well cooked, and 
not served in a pasty, undone mass. 

ROLLED OATS 

This is much preferred by some, as it requires only a short 
time to cook. Make as above, only using two cupfuls of the 
meal to one quart of water. An ordinary saucepan does very 
well for this, but the double boiler is better. 

ROLLED OATS AND SAGO MUSH 

Wash and soak one-third cup of sago in a little cold water. 
Stir one and one-half cups of rolled oats into one quart of 
salted, boiling water. Cook for fifteen minutes, then stir in the 
sago, and cook as much longer. Serve with cream, stewed fruit, . 
or fruit juice. 

GRAHAM MUSH 

Into three pints of rapidly boiling water, properly salted, stir 
dry, one heaping pint of sifted Graham flour. Cook slowly for 
one hour on the back of the range, stirring but little after the 
first few minutes. Serve with milk or cream, and a very little 
sugar if desired. 

GRAHAM MUSH WITH DATES 

Cook as above. Take a cupful of dates, cut in two, removing 
the stones, and stir into the mush just before taking from the 
fire. Serve with milk or cream. Steamed raisins or stewed figs 



16 A Friend in the Kitchen 

may be used instead of dates. Serve hot, or pour out into cups 
or moldSj first wet with cold water, and serve cold with cream. 

BOILED RICE 

Wash one cup of rice, and put to cook in four cups of boil- 
ing water, slightly salted. Cook quite rapidly for the first fifteen 
minutes, stirring a little occasionally to prevent sticking to the 
pan. Then cover closely, and cook slowly on the back of the 
range without stirring. When nearly done, add a cup of sweet 
milk, cook until tender, and serve with milk, cream, or stewed 
fruit. If the rice has been soaked overnight, put to cook in an 
equal quantity of boiling water, or equal parts of milk and 
water, and cook for about half an Ifour. 

CREAM OF WHEAT 

To four parts of boiling water previously salted, add one 
part cream of wheat, sprinkling it in with the hand, and cook 
slowly for about an hour. Serve hot with cream or stewed figs. 

CORN-MEAL MUSH, NO. 1 

Into three pints of boiling water, salted, sprinkle on'^ pint 
of corn-meal. Cook slowly for an hour, stirring occasionally. 
Serve with plenty of milk or cream. Very good and nutritious, 
especially for winter. 

CORN-MEAL MUSH, NO. 2 

Put to boil one quart of water, adding one teaspoonful of 
salt. Mix smooth one tablespoonful of flour and two cupfuls 
each of milk and co"n-nieal. Stir this gradually into the rapidly 
boiling water; boil about half an hour, stirring frequently. 
Serve as soon as done, with rich milk. 

CORN-MEAL SQUARES 

Take cold, left-over corn-meal mush, cut into rather thick 
slices, and then into inch squares. Put the squares into a 
tureen, and pour over them some hot milk or cream. Cover 
the dish, let stand a few minutes, and serve. 

BARLEY MUSH 

To each cupful of pearl barley, previously washed, add five 
:ups of boiling water, a teaspoonful of salt, and cook in a double 
boiler for three or four hours. Serve with cream, lemon sauce, 
or stewed fruit. 

BOILED WHEAT 

To one pa-t of good, plump wheat add five parts of cold 
water, a little salt, and cook slowly from four to six hours, or 
until the grains burst open and are tender. If soaked overnight, 
less time for boiling will be required. Add a little more water 



A Friend in the Kitchen 17 

while cooking if necessary, but avoid much stirring. Serve hot 
or cold w^ith milk, cream, fruit, or fruit juice. A very simple 
and wholesome dish. 

GLUTEN MUSH 

Into three pints of rapidly boiling, salted water stir one pint 
of gluten; cook in a double boiler for several hours. 

HOMINY 

Soak, then put to cook in enough boiling water to cover. 
Cook gently for several hours, being careful not to stir after the 
grains begin to soften. Add a little more water if needed. 
Season with salt when done. A quantity may be cooked at a 
time, and warmed up with a little cream or butter as needed. 

CRACKED WHEAT 

Cook the same as hominy and oatmeal, using three parts of 
boiling water to one of cracked wheat. When done, turn into 
cups or molds first wet with cold water. Nice served cold with 
cream. Seedless raisins may be cooked with it. 

GRANULATED WHEAT 

Use the same proportion and cook the same as cracked 
wheat. Serve warm or cold with good sweet cream. 

CORN-MEAL CUTLETS 

Cut cold corn-meal mush into slices three inches long and 
one inch wide; roll each piece in beaten egg, slightly salted, 
then in grated bread crumbs; place on an oiled tin in the oven 
till nicely browned. Other mushes may be treated likewise. 

BROWNED RICE 

Place a small quantity on- shallow tins, and brown in the 
oven till a golden yellow, stirring frequently so that it may 
brown evenly; then steam for about an hour in a steamer over 
boiling water or in a steam cooker, allowing two parts of hot 
water to one part of rice. When done, it should be quite dry 
and mealy. It may be eaten dry, or served with brown or lentil 
sauce, or rich milk or cream. 

BAKED MUSH 

Cook any of the foregoing mushes as directed, and as soon 
as done, turn into a pan, crock, or a round tin can, first wet 
with cold water, or oiled, to prevent sticking. If brushed over 
the top with oil, a crust will not form. When cold, cut into 
slices from one half to three fourths of an inch thick, place on 
oiled tins, and bake till a nice brown. A quart of cooked mush 
will make about a dozen slices.

^T*OAST makes a very nice breakfast dish, and is easily 
L and quickly prepared. It can be made in a variety 
of ways which are both simple and wholesome. When 
properly prepared, it furnishes abundant nourishment, and 
is easily digested. 

The proper foundation for all toasts is zwieback (pro- 
nounced zwiback), or twice-baked bread. This may be made 
from either fresh or stale bread, the fresh making the more 
crisp and delicious for dry eating. The bread should be light 
and of good quality. That which is sour, heavy, and unfit 
to eat untoasted, should never be used for toast. 

Toasts afford an excellent opportunity for using up left- 
over slices of bread, and its use is therefore a matter of 
economy as well as of securing variety in diet, 

^ )ii ^ 

ZWIEBACK, OR DRY TOAST 

Cut fresh or stale light bread, either white or brown, into 
slices half an inch thick, place on tins, and bake slowly in a 



A Friend in the Kitchen 19 

moderate oven until browned evenly throughout. Care should 
be taken not to scorch the bread. It should not be put into an 
oven that is merely warm. It should be baked, not simply dried. 
The common method of toasting merely the outside of the 
bread by holding it over a fire is not the most wholesome way 
of preparing toast. When properly made, it will be crisp 
throughout. Zwieback may be prepared in quantity and kept 
on hand for use. It furnishes a good article of diet, especially 
for dyspeptics, eaten dry, or with milk or cream. 

MILK TOAST 

Scald one cupful of milk in double boiler, then add one tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch, mixed with a little cold water; stir until 
it thickens. Cook about ten minutes, then add one teaspoonful 
of butter, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, and pour it over six 
slices of zwieback, previously moistened with hot water or milk. 

TOAST WITH CREAM SAUCE 

Prepare a cream sauce as directed on page yj. Moisten five 
or six slices of zwieback by dipping them quickly into hot 
water or milk, place them on a dish, and pour over the hot 
cream sauce. 

ASPARAGUS TOAST 

Prepare asparagus by washing each stalk free from sand; 
remove the tough portions, cut the stalks into small pieces, and 
stew in a little hot, salted water; drain off the water as soon as 
done, add a cup of milk, and season with a little butter and salt. 
Cream may be used instead of the milk and butter. Moisten the 
zwieback with hot milk, and place in a dish. Pour over the 
stewed asparagus, and serve hot. 

BERRY TOAST 

Prepare zwieback as above. Take fresh or canned straw- 
berries, raspberries, mulberries, or other fruit, mash well with a 
spoon, add sugar to sweeten, and serve as a dressing on the 
slices of zwieback previously moistened. 

EGG TOAST 

Moisten slices of zwieback in hot milk or cream, season with 
a sprinkle of salt, and serve hot with a poached egg on each 
slice. For poached eggs see page 66. 

BANANA TOAST 

Moisten slices of zwieback in hot milk. Mash the bananas 
into a pulp, or cut into thin slices, and place some on each slice 
of toast. 



20 A Friend in the Kitchen 

FRUIT TOAST 

Take stewed apricots, peaches, or plums, rub through a col- 
ander, heat to boiling, thicken with a little cornstarch, sweeten 
to taste, and pour over the moistened zwieback. 

CREAM TOAST 

Moisten slices of zwieback in hot water, sprinkle with a little 
salt, and dip over each slice a spoonful or two of nice, sweet, 
cold cream. 

BUTTER TOAST 

Place each slice of zwieback on a small plate, pour over a 
little hot water, and quickly drain off; add a sprinkle of salt, if 
desired, spread lightly with butter and serve. 

CRUSHED TOAST 

Take fresh, but thoroughly toasted bread or crackers, or some 
of each, grind closely in a cofifee or hand mill, or crush with a 
rolling-pin, and serve in small dishes with milk, cream, or fruit 
juice. This may be served as a substitute for the health food 
known as granola. Crushed toast is also a very serviceable 
article for use in soups and puddings. 

TOMATO TOAST 

Moisten . slices of zwieback in hot milk, and serve with a 
dressing prepared by heating a pint of strained, stewed tomatoes 
to boiling, and thickening with a tablespoonful of flour or corn- 
starch rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Season with salt 
and a little cream or butter, and pour over the toast. 

BEAN PASTE 

Soak one cupful of white beans overnight in cold water; put 
to cook in the morning in boiling water, and cook to a pulp, 
and till the water is quite absorbed. Rub through a colander, 
then add a tablespoonful of finely minced onion, one teaspoon- 
ful of powdered sage, one saltspoonful of celery salt, the juice 
of one lemon, two or three spoonfuls of tomato juice, if at hand, 
and salt to taste. Simmer together for a short time, then use 
cold to spread on toast or bread as a relish, or in the place of 
butter, or for making sandwiches. 

Variety. — Remember, as Home Note says, that "variety of 
diet is important. Ill health often follows a monotonous same- 
ness of diet. Oatmeal, bread and butter, and marmalade, are all 
excellent breakfast dishes of their kind, but when given every 
morning, for years at a time, they become positively nauseating." 




A VOICE FROM THE CORN 

" I was made to be eaten, not to be drank, 
To be thrashed in a barn, not soaked in a tank; 
I come as a blessing when put in a mill, 
As a blight and a curse when run through a still; 
Make me up into loaves, and your children are fed; 
But made into drink, I will starve them instead. 
In bread I'm a servant, the eater shall rule. 
In drink I'm a master, the drinker a fool. 
Then remember my warning; my strength I'll employ, — 
If eaten, to strengthen, if drunk, to destroy." 

The wandering Arab lives almost entirely upon bread, with a 
few dates as a relish. 

Behind the nutty loaf is the mill wheel; behind the mill is 
the wheat field; on the wheat field rests the sunlight; above the 
sun is God. — James Russell Lowell. 

^ ^ ^ 

BREAD stands at the head of all foods. It has very 
properly been termed " the staff of life." 

Why this is so is because wheat, from which bread is 
mostly made, contains more nearly than any other one 
article, all the necessary food elements required to sustain 
the human system, and these, too, in proper proportions, 
and so forms most nearly a perfect food. From it the 
brain, bones, muscles, and nerves, all receive a large amount 
of nourishment. 

This being so, bread should enter largely into the daily 
bill of fare of every family. It is hardly too much to say 
that no meal is complete without it. 



22 A Friend in the Kitchen 

Where little bread is used, serious defects may frequently 
be observed. For instance, in some of the islands of the 
Pacific Ocean, where no wheat has been grown, and little 
could be obtained, the inhabitants almost universally have 
poor teeth. The early decay of the teeth so prevalent among 
the rising generation to-day, may generally be attributed to 
four causes : ( i ) A lack of sufficient lime in the water ; 
(2) too free indulgence in sweets, such as rich cakes, jams, 
and candies; (3) too large an amount of flesh foods; and 
(4) an insufficient supply of good, simple, wholesome bread, 
especially whole wheat bread. 

Home-made bread, when properly prepared, is generally 
to be preferred to bakers' bread. Chemicals and adultera- 
tions, as well as a lack of cleanliness and proper care in 
preparation, not infrequently characterize the latter, and 
thus give rise to serious stomach disorders. Moreover, 
bakers' bread is not always obtainable, and is always nec- 
essarily more expensive than that which is home-made. 
The baker can not afford to work for nothing. For these 
reasons, every woman, and especially every wife and mother, 
ought to know how to make good bread. The temptation 
to patronize the bake shop should not outweigh the inter- 
ests of the health of the family, and the duty to practise 
economy. 

The essentials to good bread-making are three : — 

1. Good flour. 

2. Good yeast. 

3. Proper attention. 

When either of these is lackmg, good results can not 
be obtained. Poor flour will not produce good bread ; good 
flour and poor yeast will not make good bread ; and good 
flour and good yeast with improper attention will not insure 
good bread. All three are essential. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 23 

The first thing to consider in the making of bread is the 
flour. Good flour will generally be found to have a creamy 
white tint. That which is of a bluish white is seldom the 
best. Good flour will fall light and elastic from the hand. 
Flour that retains the imprint of the fingers when squeezed, 
and falls in a damp, clammy mass, should be avoided. 

The second essential is good yeast. One may have ever 
so good flour and yet make poor bread, if the flour is used 
in conjunction with poor yeast. Good yeast has a fresh, 
pungent odor, and is light and foamy ; while poor yeast has 
a sour odor, and a dull, watery appearance. 

The third essential is proper attention. In winter, bread 
sponge should be made at night if it is desired to have the 
bread baked in the early part of the day. The flour used in 
making the sponge should first be warmed, and the sponge 
covered with several thicknesses of cloth, and set in a warm 
place till morning. 

In hot weather set the sponge early in the morning, and 
the bread can be baked by noon. Both the sponge and 
dough are best kept in an earthen crock or jar, as they are 
less quickly affected by drafts of air. 

As soon as the sponge has risen to be light and puffy, it 
should receive attention immediately, if desired to have the 
bread white and sweet. If allowed to reach the point of 
running over, or falling in the center, it has stood too long. 
For this reason sponge set at night should be mixed late in 
the evening, and attended to as early in the morning as 
possible. 

In using very active yeast, it will not be necessary to 
set a sponge. Mix the ingredients into a good bread dough 
at the first mixing, beating the batter well while stirring in 
the flour. The more thoroughly the batter is beaten, the 



24 A Friend in the Kitchen 

less kneading the dough will require. Set the bread in this 
way in the morning, and it can be baked by noon. 

A few mealy potatoes, cooked and mashed, added to the 
sponge, makes the bread sweeter and keeps it fresh longer. 
Milk used in connection with yeast should first be scalded 
and cooled to lukewarm. 

Too much flour should not be used in mixing, as it will 
make the bread hard and tough ; but enough should be used 
to make the dough firm and elastic. Turn the dough out 
on the molding-board and knead it, not with the tips of the 
fingers, but with the whole hands, from the sides into the 
center, turning frequently, that all portions may be thor- 
oughly worked. When the dough is smooth and elastic, 
with no dry flour left on its surface, form into a smooth ball, 
and place back in the crock, which should be washed clean, 
dried and oiled, to prevent the dough from sticking. Ob- 
serve how full it makes the crock ; cover up warmly, and 
when it has doubled its bulk, form gently into loaves, 
handling the dough as little as possible, and place in the 
pans for the last rising. When the loaves are risen to twice 
their size, place in a moderately hot oven to bake. The 
oven should be hot when the bread is put in. By no means 
have the bread, when ready to bake, wait for the oven to 
be heated, as it may then become too light, run over in the 
oven, and possibly be sour. 

When nearly ready to bake, test the oven by putting in 
it a piece of writing-paper ; if it turns dark brown in six 
minutes, the oven is of about the proper heat. If bread 
bakes too fast, a crust is formed on the outside of the loaf 
which prevents the inside from becoming hot enough to 
dry thoroughly, and the result is that the inside of the 
loaf is too moist, while the outside is baked hard. Bread 
should not brown much under fifteen or twenty minutes 



A Friend in the Kitchen 



25 



after being placed in the oven. If it rises much after being 
put in the oven, the heat is not sufficient. Bread should be 
turned around in the oven if it does not rise or brown evenly. 

Medium-sized loaves should be baked from fifty to sixty 
minutes ; small French loaves about thirty-five minutes. 
Bread is done when it shrinks from the pan, and can be 
handled without burning the fingers. 

When taken from the oven, the loaves should be turned 
out of the pans, placed on their sides, so that the crust will 
not soften by the steam, and covered with a thin cloth. 
When cold, keep in a covered stone jar or a tin box, which 
should be kept free from crumbs and musty pieces of bread, 
and scalded and dried thoroughly every few days. 

As to their healthfulness, the most wholesome breads 
are unleavened breads, or those made without either yeast, 
baking-powder, soda, or cream of tartar, such as gems, 
rolls, and crackers. Next come those made with good 
yeast ; then those with baking-powder, if comparatively 
pure ; and lastly those made v/ith soda and sour milk, or 
soda and cream of tartar. Baking-powder is preferable to 
soda. The latter should seldom if ever be used, as it is injuri- 
ous to the health, being an active dyspepsia-producing article, 

WHITE BREAD 

Scald a quart of new or unskimmed milk, 
let cool to lukewarm, then stir in a dissolved 
yeast cake, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and enough 
sifted flour to make, a thin batter. Cover, and 
set aside till light, then work in flour until a 
dough of the proper consistency for bread is 
formed. Knead until it is smooth and elastic, 
and does not stick to the hands or board. Place 
in a clean, oiled crock, and when light, form 
into four loaves; let rise again and bake. Equal 
parts of milk and water may be used if desired. 

MOTHER'S BREAD 

In the evening boil three small potatoes, or save them out 
when cooking, and mash them with a fork in a gallon crock. 




26 A Friend in the Kitchen 

Put in about three cupfuls of flour, two tablespoonfuls each of 
salt and sugar, then pour in enough boiling water to make a 
good batter. Beat until smooth. Soak one cake of compressed 
yeast or yeast foam in one-half cup of lukewarm water, and 
when the batter is just warm stir in the yeast and beat until 
quite foamy. Set in a warm place overnight. The first thing 
in the morning dip about two quarts of flour in a pan, make a 
cavity in the center, and pour in the sponge and about a pint of 
warm water. Stir all together into a thin batter, and set in a 
warm place till after breakfast; then knead until it does not 
stick to the board, put it in a three-gallon crock, well oiled to 
prevent the dough from sticking; cover with a tin lid to keep 
a crust from forming over the top, then with several thicknesses 
of cloth, and set in a warm place until it rises up full. Then 
mold into loaves, place in pans, let rise again, and bake in a 
moderate oven for about an hour, or until

Baking Pan will make six loaves. If the loaves are 

brushed over with cold water just before 
being placed in the oven the crust will be more crisp. 

GRAHAM BREAD, NO. 1 

Take two tablespoonfuls of good liquid yeast, two cups of 
sweet milk, previously scalded and cooled to lukewarm, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and two cupfuls of white flour; beat together 
thoroughly, and set to rise. When very light, add three heap- 
ing cupfuls of sifted Graham flour, or sufficient to make a soft 
dough. Knead for a half-hour, then place in a pan slightly but- 
tered, cover warmly, and set to rise. When light, form into 
loaves, let rise again, and bake. 

GRAHAM BREAD, NO. 2 

Make a sponge as for white bread. When light, add the 
stiffly beaten white of one ^gg, one tablespoonful each of 
sugar and melted butter, and enough sifted Graham flour' to 
make a soft dough. Knead lightly, place back in oiled crock 
till light, then make into loaves, let rise, and bake. Graham 
bread should not be mixed as stiff as white bread, or it will be 
too solid. Two tablespoonfuls of molasses may be used for 
sweetening instead of sugar, if preferred. 

GRAHAM FRUIT BREAD 

Make the same as Graham bread, and when ready to form 
into loaves, add a cupful of raisins or dried currants, washed 
and dried, and dusted with flour. 




A Friend in the Kitchen 27 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

Make a sponge as for white bread. If desired a light color, 
use one fourth white flour instead of all whole wheat flour. 
Knead well, keeping the dough soft, then set in a warm place 
to rise. When light, form into loaves, let rise again, and bake. 
This bread rises slower than white bread. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

Scald one pint of corn-meal with a pint of boil- 
ing water; let cool till lukewarm, then stir in one 
dissolved yeast cTake, or one-half cup of sweet, lively- 
yeast, three tablespoonfuls of molasses, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and about three cupfuls of rye 
meal. Beat well, put in oiled pan, steam four or 
Pint five hours, then place in the oven for half an hour 

Measure to form a crust. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS 

Take two cupfuls of lukewarm milk, previously scalded, three 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, or vegetable oil, one well-beaten 
Q.gg, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, a pinch of salt, and one cake 
of yeast dissolved in a little of the milk; mix all together, then 
add enough flour to make a good batter. Let rise until light, 
knead, using sufficient flour; let rise again till very light, roll 
out to one-half inch in thickness, cut into round or oval shapes 
with a cutter, fold one third back over the top, and place in a 
pan to rise. When very light, bake in arnoderate oven. Brush 
over with beaten yolk of egg, mixed with two spoonfuls of cold 
water just before taking from the oven. Braided or plaited rolls 
may be made by cutting the rolled ddugh into strips six inches 
long and one inch wide, pinching the ends of each three strips 
together, and then braiding. 

CORN-MEAL BREAD 

Stir one-half cup of corn-meal into two cupfuls of boiling 
water; when well cooked, remove from the fire and add two cup- 
fuls of cold water; stir well together; then add one teaspoonful 
of salt, one cake of yeast dissolved in a little warm water, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar or molasses, and enough white flour 
to make a good dough. Knead well, and set to rise; when light, 
form into three loaves, let rise again, and bake for nearly an 
hour. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

Take a small pitcher and put into it a half pint of warm 
water, a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, then stir in flour 
enough to make a medium-thick batter. Set the pitcher in a 




28 A Friend in the Kitchen 

kettle of warm water to rise. It should be kept warm all the 
tirne,_ not hot, for if it is scalded, it will never rise. When light, 
stir in a pint of warm milk or water and enough warm flour 
to make a soft dough. Knead it, form into a loaf, place in the 
pan, set to rise in a warm place, and bake as soon as light. 

RAISED BISCUITS 

Make from dough prepared for white bread. When the 
dough is ready to form into loaves, divide it into small, equal 
portions, shape into smooth, round biscuits, place closely in a 
shallow baking pan, and let rise till considerably lighter than 
bread; brush lightly with milk, and bake in a rather quick oven. 

GEMS 
General Directions 

Beating in an abundance of cold air is very essential in the 
inaking of good gems, as it is this that makes them light. Cold 
air is preferable to warm air, as it ex- 
pands more when heating. 

Gems are also better when baked in 

iron pans than in tin, as the iron re- _ 

tains the heat better, and bakes the ^ . 

_ 1 -PI • u ij Gem Irons 

gems more evenly. ihe irons should 

be heated and oiled before the batter is dropped into them. 

Having the oven hot from the first is also essential, as a crust 

will then be formed immediately, and the air which has been 

beaten into the batter will thus be prevented from escaping. 

They should be placed in the oven so as to bake on the top 

first, and afterward on the bottom. These points should be 

carefully observed. Gems are best served hot. They should be 

broken open, and never cut^ with a knife, as this makes them 

heavy. 

GRAHAM GEMS, NO. 1 

Place the gem irons in the oven or on the range to heat. 
Mix salted Graham flour with cold milk or water to a batter 
thick enough to drop, beating vigorously for ten minutes to 
beat in the air. Butter the gem irons, and fill each cup nearly 
full of the batter. Put in a hot oven, and bake until done. 

. GRAHAM GEMS, NO. 2 

Beat separately the yolk and white of an egg. Add to the 
beaten yolk two cupfuls of sweet, rich milk, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and stir well together; then sift in one and one-half 
cups of Graham flour, and a scant cup of white flour, beating 
vigorously meanwhile. Continue to beat until the mixture is 
light and foamy throughout, and full of air bubbles; then stir 
in gently the stiffly beaten white of the egg. Have the gem 



A Friend in the Kitchen 29 

irons thoroughly heated, slightly butter them, drop in the batter 
with a spoon, and bake in a quick oven. 

OATMEAL GEMS 

• 
Beat separately the yolk and white of an egg. To the beaten 
yolk add a cupful of well-cooked oatmeal mush, and a half cup 
of milk or thin cream. Beat together thoroughly. Continue to 
beat while adding a cupful of white flour and a pinch of salt, 
then fold in lightly the stiffly beaten white of the tgg. Have 
the gem irons heated hot, slightly butter, drop in the batter, 
filling the little cups nearly full, and bake in a quick oven until 
a light brown. 

CORN-MEAL GEMS 

Stir well together one and one-half cupfuls of milk, and the 
yolks of two eggs previously beaten. To this add two cupfuls 
of corn-meal, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and one cupful of 
white flour. Beat thoroughly, then stir in lightly the whites of 
the eggs previously beaten to a stiff froth, and bake as above. 

GRANULATED WHEAT GEMS 

Mix together one cupful each of cold water and milk, and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Then add gradually two and one- 
half cupfuls of fine granulated wheat, beating continuously. 
Beat vigorously for ten minutes, then drop by spoonfuls into 
thoroughly heated, buttered gem irons, beating the batter 
briskly several times while dipping it in. Bake at once in a 
very hot oven. 

RICE CAKES 

Moisten one cup of well-cooked rice with two tablespoonfuls 
of cream or rich milk; add one tablespoonful of sugar, and mix 
in enough flour to make it hold together. Form into cakes one- 
third of an inch thick, and bake in a hot oven. When done, 
split open, and serve with maple or lemon sirup. To make 
lemon sirup, see page 40. 

BREAKFAST ROLLS 

To three slightly heaping cups of sifted Graham flour add a 
little salt, and one cup of milk or thin cream; cream is better. 
Stir the milk or cream into the* flour, mixing it well with the 
flour as fast as poured in. Knead thoroughly, then divide the 
dough into three portions, and with the hands roll each portion 
over and over on the molding-board until a long roll from an 
inch to an inch and a half in thickness is formed. Cut into two- 
or three-inch lengths, and bake at once in a hot oven, in a 
baking pan dusted with flour, or better, on a perforated piece 
of sheet-iron made for the purpose, placing the rolls a little 



30 A Friend in the Kitchen 

distance apart. Bake until a light brown. When done, do not 
place one on top of another. 

Flour kneaded into cold Graham flour, oatmeal, or corn-meal 
mush makes very good breakfast rolls. 

STICKS 

Make the same as breakfast rolls, only rolling the dough to 
about the size of the little finger, and cutting into three- or 
four-inch lengths. 

FRENCH ROLLS 

Make a sponge at night of one-half cake of dry or one-half 
cup of good liquid yeast, the beaten white of one egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a 
little salt, and three cups of warm milk or water, and flour 
sufficient to make a soft dough. In the morning knead well 
and let rise again. When light, roll out the dough to about 
three fourths of an inch in thickness; cut into about four-inch 
squares with a sharp knife, butter the edges, and roll each 
corner up and over to the center; place on buttered tins, allow 
the rolls to become very light, and bake in a moderately hot 
oven. The sponge for this can be set in the "morning if the 
yeast is very quick. 

TO GLAZE ROLLS 

When ready to bake, brush the rolls or biscuit lightly -with 
milk; or, when nearly baked, brush with the yolk of an egg to 
which has been added two spoonfuls of cold water and half a 
teaspoonful of sugar. Return to oven till done. 

MARYLAND OR BEATEN BISCUIT 

Mix five cupfuls of white flour, one-half cupful of vegetable 
oil or butter, and one teaspoonful of salt to a very stifle dough 
v/ith one cupful of cold water. Knead for twenty minutes, using 
no more flour for the molding-board; then beat hard with a 
wooden mallet or hammer for twenty minutes longer, until the 
dough is flat and of even thickness throughout; sprinkle over a 
little flour, fold half of the dough back evenly over the other 
half, and beat quickly around the edges, to keep in the air. 
Continue beating until the dough is brittle, and will snap if a 
piece is broken off quickly. Pinch off into pieces the size of a 
small walnut, work smooth, flatten on top with the thumb, 
prick with a fork, place on perforated tins a little distance apart, 
and bake in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or until dry 
and brittle throughout. 

WHOLE WHEAT CRISPS 

Take one cupful of rich cream, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
a pinch of salt, two cupfuls, or enough to make a stiff dough, 




A Friend in the Kitchen 31 

of fine granulated, whole wheat flour. Beat well^ and knead for 
fifteen minutes, first with a spoon, until the batter becomes too 
thick, and then with the hands. Roll out as thin as wafers, cut 
into shapes with a biscuit cutter, and bake on floured tins in a 
very hot oven. 

GRAHAM WAFERS 

Stir together one cupful each of sifted Graham 
flour and white flour, one tablespoonful each of but- 
ter and sugar, and a saltspoonful of salt; then mix 
with enough cold water to make a stiff dough. Roll 
Cake out very thin, cut into small squares, or with a cake 
Cutter cutter, and bake on tins in a quick oven. 

FRUIT BISCUIT 

Make a dough with one cupful of cold, sweet cream or rich 
milk, three cupfuls of sifted Graham or white flour, and a little 
salt. Knead thoroughly, and divide into two portions. Roll 
each quite thin, then spread one with currants, stoned dates, 
figs, or seedless raisins, chopped fine, and place the other one 
on top; press down with the rolling-pin, cut into oblong squares 
with a knife, and bake. 

CRESCENTS 

Make a dough, using the recipe for White Bread. When 
ready to form into loaves, work into it two tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and sugar; roll out into a sheet half an inch thick, 
cut into six-inch squares, then divide diagonally, forming tri- 
angles; brush each lightly with water, and roll up, beginning 
at the longest side; place on oiled pans, turning the ends toward 
each other in the form of a crescent. When very light, brush 
with milk, and bake in a quick oven for about twenty minutes. 

RUSKS 

Make a sponge at night with one cupful of sugar, one cupful 
of scalded milk, cooled to lukewarm, one-half cupful of butter, 
two eggs, one cake of dry or one-half cup of good liquid yeast, 
and sufficient flour to make a drop batter. Set in a warm place 
to rise. In the morning knead well, and when risen again, 
mold into the form of biscuits, place a little distance apart on 
buttered tins, and brush over with the beaten white of an egg 
sweetened; let stand until light, and bake. 

PLAIN BUNS 

Beat together one-fourth cup of lively yeast, one cup of 
sweet milk, previously scalded and cooled to lukewarm, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, two cups of warm flour, and set in a 
warm place to rise. When very light, work into the dough 
one-half cup of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Knead 



32 A Friend in the Kitchen 

well for ten minutes, using enough flour to make a soft dough. 
Shape into the form of biscuits a little larger than an egg; place 
on tins slightly buttered, and set in a warm place to rise. 
When very light, bake in a moderately hot oven. The tops 
may be brushed over with the sweetened beaten white of an 
egg while baking, or sprinkled with moist sugar when taken 
from the oven. 

FRUIT BUNS 

Make the same as plain buns, adding one-half cup of raisins 
or currants just before kneading and forming into buns. . 

RICE WAFFLES 

Set a sponge at night with two cupfuls of sweet milk, scalded 
and cooled to lukewarm, one tablespoonful of butter, a pinch ol 
salt, two-thirds of a cupful of boiled rice, three 
cupjFuls of flour, and one-fourth cup of liquid 
yeast. Beat the batter hard for five or six min- 
utes, and set in a warm place to rise. In the 
morning add two well-beaten eggs, and stir 
well together. Bake on a hot, buttered waffle 
iron. If this is not at hand, have the gem irons 
well heated, slightly butter to prevent sticking, 
and drop in the batter. Place in a hot oven so 
the top will bake first, and bake to a rich 
Waffle Iron brown color. Very nice for breakfast. 

PUFFS 

To two cups of milk add a little salt and the yolks of two 
eggs well beaten; then sift in, a little at a time, and beating 
meanwhile, three small cups of flour. Beat until light, then stir 
in gently the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and bake in hot 
gem irons. 

FRUIT LOAF, NO. 1 

Take enough good bread dough for one loaf, add one cupful 
of brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and one cupful of 
raisins, previously washed and dried. Knead well and let rise; 
then knead again, and place in a bread pan, let rise until light, 
and bake in a moderate oven. 

FRUIT LOAF, NO. 2 

Make a sponge of one and one-half cups of warm milk or 
water, one-half cup of good yeast, the beaten white of one ^g,E., 
one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, a little salt, and 
flour sufficient to make a soft dough. Let rise till light; then 
knead well and let rise again. When light, roll out to about 
one inch in thickness, spread over with chopped dates, or rai- 
sins, or currants which have been previously washed and dried; 
roll up and form into a loaf, let rise, and bake.

COFFEE CAKES 

Take two cupfuls of bread dough (made with milk) when 
ready for the pans; put into a deep dish and work in four table- 
spoonfuls of cocoanut or vegetable oil or butter, four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, the stiffly beaten white of one egg, and 
enough flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Knead well, and 
roll out into a long strip about nine inches in width, three feet 
in length, and one fourth of an inch thick; spread over this 
four or five tablespoonfuls of oil or melted butter, omitting 
about two inches at the farther end; beginning at end nearest, 
roll up like jelly roll; cut into slices an inch thick; place a 
little distance apart on tins sprinkled with sugar; set in a warm 
place, and when very light, brush over with oil; sprinkle with 
a little sugar, and bake. If desired, ground cinnamon or grated 
nutmeg may be sprinkled over the dough before rolling it up. 

FLANNEL CAKES 

Keat three cupfuls of milk to boiling; put into a crock one 
cupful of corn-meal and two tablespoonfuls of butter, then pour 
in the scalding milk; beat well, allow to cool to lukewarm, then 
stir in one tablespoonful of sugar, two of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, and one-half yeast cake dissolved in one-third cup warm 
water; beat well, and set to rise overnight. Bake on a hot 
griddle. 

CORN-MEAL BATTER CAKES 

To two cups of cold corn-meal mush, add one cup of sifted 
flour, and a pinch of salt; beat well the yolks of two eggs, to 
which add two-thirds cup of milk, and stir 
into the mush; beat thoroughly until light 
and smooth, adding a little more milk if nec- 
essary, to make the batter of proper consist- 
ency. Then gently stir in the whites of the 
eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and bake in small Griddle 

cakes on both sides on a griddle, slightly but- 
tered, or better still on a soapstone griddle, in which case use 
•no oil nor butter on it. Serve hot. 

BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES 

In the evening take two quarts of warm water, add one- 
fourth cup of good yeast, a teaspoonful of salt, and buckwheat 
flour enough to make a good batter. If desired, a cupful of 
corn-meal or a few spoonfuls of white flour may be us«d instead 
of all buckwheat. Beat well and set to rise. In the morning 
thin the batter with a little warm water, if necessary, and bake 
on a hot griddle. If cakes are desired for several mornings, the 
batter may be kept going by leaving at least a cupful after each 
baking, and adding the necessary warm water and buckwheat 
flour each evening as at first. 



34 A Friend in the Kitchen 

LENTIL FRITTERS 

To a pint of lentil soup (left-over soup will do), add the 
well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and sift in enough flour, a little 
at a time, beating thoroughly, to make a good batter. Then 
add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, drop by spoonfuls on 
a hot buttered griddle, and brown on both sides. 

CORN FRITTERS 

To each quart of raw sweet corn (a dozen nice ears), grated 
from the cob, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, a teaspoonful 
of salt, and one and one-half cups of fine bread or cracker 
crumbs, or enough to make a batter just stifif enough to drop 
from a spoon. Then stir in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, 
and drop with a spoon on a hot, oiled, or soapstone griddle. 
Serve hot. 

USES FOR STALE BREAD 

Whole slices of stale bread, if in good condition, may be 
steamed or used for toast. Crumbs, crusts, and broken pieces 
not suitable for this purpose may be placed in a pan, and put 
into a slow oven until thoroughly dried (not browned), then 
ground in a mill, or rolled on a breadboard with the rolling- 
pin, and put away in covered jars for use. This will be useful 
for making corn-meal cutlets or anything that is to be rolled 
in crumbs, dipped in egg, and browned. 

POTATO YEAST 

Put to cook six medium-sized potatoes in two quarts of hot 
water. Tie a handful of hops in a cloth, and boil with the pota- 
toes during the last ten minutes. When done, take potatoes and 
hops from the water, leaving the water over the fire. Mash the 
potatoes fine, and add four tablespoonfuls of flour, and two each 
of sugar and salt Stir well together. Pour over this mixture 
the boiling potato water, stirring well that no lumps be formed. 
When cooled to lukewarm, stir in a cupful of liquid yeast, or 
one cake of dry yeast dissolved in warm water. After fermen- 
tation has ceased, turn into an earthen jar previously scalded, 
cover, and set in a cool, dark place. Shake before using. 

HOP YEAST 

Steep a handful of hops in a quart of hot water for five min- 
utes. Then strain, and turn the boiling water over a cupful 
of flour, blended with a little cold water. Add one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and two of sugar; let cool till lukewarm, then stir 
in a half cup of liquid yeast, or one cake of dry or compressed 
yeast dissolved in a little warm water. Set aside for twenty- 
four hours, stirring occasionally; then bottle and keep as above. 




The earth to thee her increase 
yields, 

The trees their fruitage bring: 

And glittering in the suniit 
fields. 

The vines with bounty spring. 

" Every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding 
seed; to you it shall be for meat." Gen. i : 29. 

If families could be induced to substitute the apple — sound, 
ripe, and luscious — for pies, cakes, candies, and other sweet- 
meats with which children are too often stuffed, there would 
be a diminution of doctor's bills, sufficient in a single year to 
lay in a stock of this delicious fruit for a season's use. — Pro- 
fessor Faraday. 

There is much false economy; those who are too poor to 
have seasonable fruits and vegetables, will yet have pie and 
pickles all the year. They can not afford oranges, yet can afford 
tea and coffee daily. — Health Calendar.

FRUITS are a natural food. They form no inconsider- 
able part of those products of the earth given by the 
Creator to our first parents as food. " Behold, I have 
given you," he says, " every herb bearing seed, which is 
upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which 
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for 
meat." Gen. i : 29. 

Fruits are not only delightful to the eye, pleasing to 
the smell, and satisfying to the taste, but they contain 
elements which are necessary for the best maintenance of 
the system ; hence the natural craving for them when the 
system is in a normal condition.

While not containing- a large amount of nutrition com- 
pared to their size, they are, nevertheless, valuable on 
account of their juices, and also because of their giving bulk 
to our food, — a very necessary thing to be considered. 

Containing as they do from seventy-five to ninety per 
cent of water, their use naturally allays thirst. If their 
use were more general, there would doubtless be less desire 
for unnatural drinks. 

As a rule fruits, especially acid and sub-acid fruits, are 
cooling to the blood, and most kinds also act as a laxative 
to the system, tending to keep it free and open. They 
should, therefore, be freely used in the daily bill of fare, 
though in proper combinations. Fruits go well with grains 
and milk, but not so well with vegetables, especially acid 
fruits. 

And what gives a nicer appearance to the table than a 
dish of fruit! The very sight is inviting and appetizing. 

In preparing fresh fruit for 
the table, care should be taken 
to select only that which is 
sound and ripe. It should 
also be carefully cleaned. 
Apples should be wiped with 
a damp cloth, and their 
beauty will be further en- 
hanced by polishing them 
with a dry one. Plums should 
be likewise treated. Grapes 
Fruit Dish should be washed, and the 

stem ends of bananas cut off. Bananas may also be peeled, 
sliced, and served with cream. Oranges may be placed on 
the table whole, or their skins cut into eighths, and peeled 
half-way down. In serving cherries in their natural state, 
the stems should be left on. 




A Friend in the Kitchen 2>7 

Much taste may be displayed in the arrangement of 
fresh fruits for the table. A few green leaves interspersed 
with the fruit, or a variety of fruits tastily arranged on 
the same dish, make a very attractive appearance. 

Nature sets before us an abundance of delicious fruits, 
and these in almost endless varieties and flavors. 

Most fruits are both wholesome and agreeable when 
eaten raw, but many are rendered more easy of digestion 
by cooking. Some persons with weak digestion can not 
eat many kinds of raw fruits, but almost every one can eat 
most kinds when cooked. 

The following are some of the most simple and prac- 
tical ways in which fruits may be prepared : — 

)^ Jg «? 

BAKED APPLES, NO. 1 

Apples to be baked may be cored and pared or baked with 
the skins on. If firm and quite tart, pare, place in a pie dish, 
add sugar and a little hot water, and bake in a moderate oven. 
If the apples are juicy, less water will be required. When 
tender, turn into a dish, and pour over them the sirup or juice. 

BAKED APPLES, NO. 2 

Pare and core without halving, a number of nice, tart apples; 
fill the centers with sugar and jelly, lay closely in a shallow 
pan, add a little water, and bake slowly, basting occasionally 
with the sirup to keep the centers well filled. Bake till brown 
and tender, and serve with a boiled custard made with two cups 
of milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, and vanilla to 
flavor. 

STEWED APPLES 

Pare, core, and cut into small pieces some moderately tart 
apples, place in a saucepan, and add sufficient boiling water to 
stew to a pulp; cook slowly for about an hour, stirring but 
little. When cool, add sugar to sweeten. 

BAKED SWEET APPLES 

Select good, sweet apples. Wash, but do not pare or core 
them; put into a baking pan with a little water, and bake in a 
hot oven. Baste occasionally with the juice in the bottom of 



38 ' A Friend in the Kitchen 

the pan. When done, if desired, each apple may be dipped 
in the beaten white of an egg, then in powdered sugar, and 
returned to the oven until the icing is set. Plain sweet baked 
apples are very nice served with cream. 

APPLE SCALLOP 

Pare, core, and slice a half dozen good cooking apples. 
Spread a layer in the bottom of a deep pudding dish, then over 
these a layer of bread crumbs mixed with a little sugar, thus 
alternating till the dish is filled, having a layer of apples on 
top. Add a half cup of cold water, and bake in a rather quick 
oven till done. Serve with rich milk or cream. 

BOILED APPLES 

Remove the cores and cook whole, or in halves, in enough 
boiling water to cover them. Cook slowly. When tender, re- 
move the apples to a dish with a spoon or fork. Sweeten the 
juice with sugar, add a little lemon extract, thicken slightly 
with a very little cornstarch blended with a little cold water, 
and pour over the apples. Serve when cool. 

BAKED PEARS 

Take good, sound pears, cut in halves, pare, and fill an enam- 
eled pudding dish, sprinkling sugar through them; pour in a 
cupful of hot water, cover tightly, and bake slowly till tender. 
Serve cold. Or wash, wipe, and bake whole in a shallow dish, 
putting in a very little water. 

STEWED PEARS 

Pare, quarter, and core nice ripe pears, and drop into cold 
water to keep from discoloring. Make a sirup, allowing two 
cups of water and a half cup of sugar to each quart of fruit. 
Boil the sirup for a few minutes, put in the fruit, and cook 
until tender and pink in color, being careful not to b"eak the 
f uit by stirring. Three or four slices of lemon added to the 
sirup while boiling will improve the flavor of the, pears. Re- 
move the lemon before putting in the fruit. 

BAKED QUINCES 

Pare, core, and bake the same as apples. The fruit may be 
left whole, and the centers filled with sugar. Sufficient water 
should be used so the fruit will not become dry. Baste with 
the sirup while baking. 

BAKED PEACHES, NO. 1 

Take good, firm peaches, pa'-e, cut in halves, removing the 
stones, and place in a deep pudding dish, sprinkling with sugar. 
Add a little water, and bake until tender. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 39 

BAKED PEACHES, NO. 2 

Bake as above; when done, cover the top with a meringue 
made of the whites of two or three eggs beaten stiff and a little 
powdered sugar; return to the oven and brown slightly. Serve 
cold with cream. 

STEWED PEACHES 

Take ripe peaches, pare, or wipe carefully with a damp cloth; 
cut in halves, remove the stones, and drop into cold water. 
When ready, place the fruit in a saucepan, adding sufficient 
boiling water to keep from burning. Add sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls to each quart of fruit. Cook slowly until tender, 
generally from twenty to thirty minutes. 

STEWED PRUNES 

Wash the prunes thoroughly in warm water, rinse, then add 
water to cover, or about three parts water to one of prunes, 
and soak for several hours, or overnight. Put them to cook in 
the same water in which they soaked, and stew gently until • 
tender. When nearly done, add a little sugar if desired. Serve 
cold. 

STEWED FRUITS 

Small fruits are better stewed in a double enamel saucepan, 
and the larger kind baked in a tightly covered earthen crock 
or jar in the oven, with as little water as possible. Dried fruit, 
such as figs, prunes, peaches, raisins, dates, etc., should first be 
well washed, rinsed, soaked for several hours in enough water 
to cover, and afterward cooked in the same water in which they 
have soaked. 

PINEAPPLE 

Pare, cut into thin slices into a dish, and sprinkle lightly 
with sugar; let stand in a cool place for an hour, and serve. 

FRUIT MOLD 

Stew a quart of berries in a small quantity of water for fif- 
teen or twenty minutes; then add sugar to taste, and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water; cook 
until thickened, then turn into molds first wet with cold water; 
serve cold with milk or cream. Heat fruit juices and treat 
similarly. 

BANANAS WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Remove the peel, cut into thin slices, and sprinkle with a 
very little sugar and a few drops of orange juice. Serve in 
small dishes, placing a tablespoonful of whipped cream on each 



40 A Friend in the Kitchen 

dish. If bananas are slightly scraped after removing the skins, 
they will be more readily digested. 

APPLE BUTTER 

Pare, quarter, and core about 

equal parts of sweet and tart apples. 

Boil sweet cider down, about four 

gallons into one gallon. Cook the 

Large Spoon apples in either sweet cider or water 

till soft, then add the boiled cider, 

and boil and stir with a wooden spoon 

until thick. A little butter and ground cinnamon may be added 

for flavoring, and sugar if necessary. Can in jars, or set away 

in jars without canning if desired for immediate use. 

LEMON SIRUP 

Boil one cupful of sugar and one-fourth cupful of water 
until it slightly thickens; add a small teaspoonful of butter and 
a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Serve hot. 

LEMON HONEY 

Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan to warm; 
then add one cup of sugar, the juice and grated rind of two 
lemons, and two eggs well beaten; cook until thickened, stir- 
ring constantly that no lumps be formed, and, if not cooked 
in a double boiler, being careful not to burn. When done, 
turn into cups and cover the same as jelly. Nice used as 
a filling for layer cake. 

PLUM MARMALADE 

Wash the plums, cut them in halves, removing the stones, 
and cook for about fifteen minutes, allowing a scant cup of 
water to each quart of fruit. Then rub through a colander, add 
one cup of sugar to each quart of pulp, and boil slowly one 
hour, stirring often to prevent burning. 

GRAPE MARMALADE 

Make the same as plum marmalade, only allowing half a cup 
of water to a quart of fruit for cooking. 

TO MAKE FRUIT JELLY 

Choose a bright, sunny day for making jelly, in order to 
have it as firm and clear as possible. Make in small quantities 
at a time, using only porcelain or graniteware in preparing fruit 
or juice. Small fruits should be used as soon after being 
picked as possible, and should not be overripe. Cherries should 
be mixed with one fourth their quantity of currants, as they do 
not jelly easily. Two parts red raspberry with one part currant 



A Friend in the Kitchen 41 

juice makes a nice-flavored jelly. Place the fruit desired for 
the jelly in the saucepan, add only enough water to keep from 
burning, and cook until tender or well scalded; then drain 
through a strong, coarse, white flannel or cotton bag first 
wrung out of hot water. If the bag is made three-cornered, 
the weight of the fruit at the large top presses the juice out 
more freely at the point. Heat the sugar in the oven, stirring 
frequently to prevent burning. About three fourths of a pound 
should be used to each pint of juice. To prevent the jelly 
glasses from breaking, place them in a pan of cold water and 
allow it to come nearly to boiling; or with a cloth rub the 
outside of them well with a little butter or oil, and pour in 
the juice slowly. A little paraffin poured over the jelly when 
cooled, or writing-paper cut to fit the glasses, and oiled, is good 
for covering before putting on the covers. 

APPLE JELLY 

Select nice tart, red apples, wash, quarter, and core, but do 
not pare; add a small quantity of water, and boil only until soft. 
Then strain as directed for making fruit jelly, measure the 
juice, return it to a clean saucepan, and boil for ten or fifteen 
minutes, skimming thoroughly; Add the heated sugar, three- 
fourths pound to each pint of juice. Boil a few minutes, or 
until it jellies nicely, then turn into glasses. 

CURRANT JELLY 

Weigh the fruit, and to each pound weigh out half the 
weight of granulated sugar. Place a few of the currants in a 
granite saucepan, mash with a potato masher to extract enough 
juice to keep it from burning, then add the remainder of the 
fruit, and boil about twenty minutes, stirring frequently to 
prevent burning; strain, return juice to a clean saucepan, let 
boil for five minutes, skim, then add the sugar previously 
heated. This should jelly at once. Turn into glasses. Make 
blackberry and raspberry jelly in the same way. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Wash, wipe, and remove any imperfect spots, quarter and 
pore, but do not pare the fruit. Cut into small pieces, and place 
in the preserving pan, with water enough to half cover. Cook 
until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from the fire, and 
strain through a jelly-bag, measure the juice, return to a clean 
saucepan, let boil fifteen minutes, then add sugar, three-fourths 
pound to each pint of juice. Boil until it jellies nicely, remov- 
ing the scum, and when done, turn into the jelly cups at once. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Pick oyer and wash one quart of cranberries, and put them 
m a granite saucepan with one cupful of boiling water; cook 
about ten minutes, or until soft. Then put them through a 



42 A Friend in the Kitchen 

strainer or vegetable press, return the juice to the pan, add two 
cupfuls of sugar, place over the fire, and cook about five min- 
utes. Turn into a mold to cool. 

HOW TO CAN FRUIT 

General Remarks 

Boiling or canning fruit consists in sealing up in air-tight 
bottles, or jars, fruit which has previously been cooked. Many- 
do not appreciate the value of canning fruit because they have 
never tried it. But the process is so simple, and the result so 
satisfactory, that those who have ever given it a trial usually 
feel well repaid for the effort put forth. 

Canning fruit practically lengthens the fruit season until it 
is perennial. Fruit, if properly canned, can be preserved, even 
for years, in a very natural and wholesome state. 

While it is true that in semitropical countries some kind of 
fruit can be obtained from the markets at most seasons of the 
year, it is both a matter of providence and economy to lay by, 
at a time when fruit is cheap and in season, for those times 
when it is scarce, high-priced, or unobtainable. A lesson can 
here be learned from the bee. During the summer, when the 
flowers are in bloom, it culls the sweet, that it may have a store 
of honey to eat in the winter hours. 

It is very desirable to have the fruit fresh, as picked from 
the tree or vine; but many of the nicest and most juicy and 
delicately flavored fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, cur- 
rants, gooseberries, plums, blueberries, cherries, peaches, and 
apricots are in season for only a comparatively short time. It 
is, therefore, of value to know how to preserve these for the 
unseasonable portions of the year. It is a matter of no little 
convenience for the housewife to have these delicious fruits in 
her house, ready for use at a moment's notice. But this can be 
the case only by having on hand a supply of canned fruit. 

Some may think that this supply of canned fruit can readily 
be substituted by the same kinds of fruit put up in jams, mar- 
malades, etc., and that these can be purchased at reasonable 
prices at the stores all ready for use, and the trouble of pre- 
serving fruit one's self is thereby saved. While this may be 
true, the fruit prepared thus is not to be compared to fruit in its 
more natural state. The amount of sugar generally used in 
making jams and marmalades causes them to be too rich in 
saccharine matter, and consequently more liable, if freely used, 
to injure the teeth, cause acidity of the stomach, dyspepsia, and 
liver trouble, while nearly all, even dyspeptics, can eat simple 
stewed fruit of one kind or another without injury.

Mason Can 



Selecting Cans 

In canning fruit, care should be taken to provide good cans 
and perfectly fitting covers. This is a matter of much impor- 
tance. The Mason glass cans, or jars, with the 
white porcelain-lined covers and white rubber 
bands, are, perhaps, the best. It may seem a 
little expensive on the start to purchase these, 
but there is practically no further expense 
connected with them, aside fi'om providing 
new rubbers or covers occasionally, as the 
jars can be used year after year, or until 
broken. Either the pint, quart, or two-quart 
jars may be used, as best suits the needs of 
the family. 

If a Mason can opener is not at hand, the 
process of opening the jars may be made 
easier by first running the edge of a thin 
knife blade around under the rubbers, care 
being taken not, by prying or otherwise, to 
injure the rubbers or lids. 

After the fruit has been used from the jars, 
wash and dry them, and set away for future use. The rubbers 
and covers may be put into a cloth bag and hung away from 
the dust. 

Process 

Select good, sound, fresh fruit, but not overripe, or it will 
be mushy and insipid when cooked. The larger fruits should 
not be quite as soft for canning as for eating. 

Cook in a graniteware or enameled saucepan or preserving 
kettle. Iron, tin, copper, or brass should not be used. 

Always cook slowly, as rapid boiling breaks up the fruit, 
and causes it to lose much of its nice flavor. 

Cook thoroughly and evenly, in small quantities, and in as 
little water as possible, fruit being better cooked in its own 
juice, which soon boils out. The length of time required for 
cooking will depend upon the kind and quantity of fruit, hard 
and less ripe fruit requiring more time. 

/ Utensils for Canning Fruit 

Two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar to each quart of fruit 
will generally be found sufficient for the milder fruits; the 
more tart, such as plums, currants, gooseberries, etc., will re- 
quire from six to eight tablespoonfuls. 

While the fruit is cooking, immerse two or three jars in a 
large pan of scalding (not boiling) water, laying them down 
if there is room. If the jars are new, put them in cold water, 
and gradually raise the temperature, to prevent them from 
breaking. Likewise put the covers in a basin of hot water. 
Much depends on keeping everything hot.

Have ready an enameled dipper or cup, a cloth for wiping 
the outside of the jars, a spoon, fork, and a small pan in which 
to set the jars while being filled. 

When the fruit is well cooked, roll one of the jars over in 
the hot water, empty it, place it in the small pan, and quickly 
fill with the boiling fruit, putting in a little of the juice first. 
Fill to overflowing. Skim oflf all foam or bubbles of air that 
come to the top. If any bubbles are seen in the fruit, pass a

jar, slightly stirring, when they will come to the top, and can 
be skimmed ofif. Wipe the juice from the top of the jar, and 
screw down the cover quickly and tightly. See that the rubber 
extends beyond the cover all around. Should any part of the 
edge of the cgver fail to fit down into the rubber tightly after 
being screwed on, press down all around with the edge of the 
handle of a strong knife. Turn the jars upside down to cool. 
If no juice leaks out, the sealing is perfect. 

After a few hours turn the jars right side up, and watch for 
a few days. If there is any leakage or sign of fermentation, 
the work is a failure, and the fruit should be opened at once, 




A Friend in the Kitchen 45 ' 

a little more sugar added, boiled, and used as soon as possible. 
If all is right, store in a cool, dark place for future use. If a 
proper place is not convenient, wrap the jars in brown paper 
to keep out the light, as this is likely to cause fermentation. 

If the foregoing directions are carefully followed, there is 
no reason why the work should not be a perfect success. 

ANOTHER METHOD 

If it is desired to preserve the fruit asnearly whole as pos- 
sible, prepare it as for cooking, place it, dry, compactly in the 

jars, and screw the covers on 
loosely without rubbers. Place the 
jars, six or eight at a time, in a 
boiler, standing them on thin pieces 
of board, and filling the boiler with 
sufficient warm water to come up 
half way on the jars. Cover 
tightly, using a thick cloth, if nec- 
essary, to keep in the steam; place 
Cooking Boiler on the range, and after the water 

comes to the boiling-point, cook 
for from one-half to one hour, according to kind and ripeness 
of fruit. When cooked, remove the jars, taking care not to 
allow a draft to strike them, to prevent cracking; allow to settle 
a few minutes; remove the covers, and fill with a sirup, boil- 
ing hot, allowing about a cup of sugar to each quart of fruit; 
or, if desired to can without sugar, fill the jars with boiling 
water. Put on the rubbers, and seal at once, testing by turning 
bottom side up. 

This method should be employed in canning vegetables. 
Only perfectly fresh vegetables should be used for canning. 

CANNED BEANS AND PEAS 

Prepare string-beans as for ordinary cooking, then press and 
pack them closely into the jars until full, adding a little salt; 
fill the jars to overflowing with cold water, then screw on the 
covers fairly close, place the jars in a boiler, as directed above, 
and cook for four hours; remove from the water, take oflf the 
covers, place on the rubbers, screw on the covers tightly. Peas 
should be shelled, then canned in the same manner. 

CANNED SWEET CORN 

Select that which is fresh, and cut from the cob as directed 
for stewed sweet corn (page 57). Then press and pack closely 
into the jars until the milk appears on the top, and they are 
full. No water or salt should be added. Boil for five or six 
hours. 



46 A Friend in the Kitchen 

CANNED PEACHES 

Select ripe, firm peaches, nearly soft enough to eat, avoiding 
the clingstones. The Crawfords are perhaps the best. Pare, 
divide in halves, removing the stones, and drop into cold water 
to prevent discoloring. For each quart of fruit pour a cupful 
of water into a saucepan, add three or four tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, and let boil up; drain the peaches from the cold water, 
and put them into the hot sirup; cook slowly till tender, and can. 

CANNED BERRIES 

Select those freshlj'- picked; if necessary to be washed, place 
a few at a time in a colander and dip in and out of cold water; 
cook in a small quantity of water, adding the necessary sugar 
when nearly done, and can. 

CANNED QUINCES 

Wipe with a cloth, pare, quarter, core, and divide each quar- 
ter into thirds. For each two quarts of fruit pour three cups of 
water into a saucepan, add nearly two cups of sugar, and let ■ 
boil up; then put in the fruit, and cook slowly for an hour and 
a half, or until tender and of a rich pink color, and can. Equal 
parts of quinces and apples or pears may be stewed together. 

CANNED TOMATOES 

Select smooth, a little under-ripe, meaty tomatoes; put them 
into a pan, and pour scalding water over them to make the 
skins come off readily; then with a sharp, pointed knife re- 
move the cores, pare, cut into thick slices, press well into the 
jars, screw the covers on loosely without rubbers, place in 
boiler, and cook for thirty minutes after reaching the boiling- 
point, according to directions under "Another Method." But 
little filling will be needed after being cooked. For this have a 
few tomatoes stewed in a saucepan. Turn upside down till 
cool, then wrap in brown paper, and keep in a dark place. 

GRAPE JUICE 

Take fresh, well-ripened, dark, juicy grapes, such as the 
Black Prince or Concord; pick from the stems, rejecting all 
that are imperfect; wash well, and put to cook in an enameled 
saucepan with a pint of water for each three quarts of grapes. 
Cook slowly for half an hour, or until the grapes burst open; 
then drain oflf the juice through a jelly-bag, filtering the skins 
and seeds through a separate bag. Reheat, add one-half cup of 
sugar to a quart of juice if desired to sweeten, and can in jars 
the same as f-uit; or, put in sterilized bottles, filling within an 
inch of the top, and cork at once with good, solid corks; cut 
oflf the corks close to the bottle, and seal over with sealing- 
wax. Bottle the juice from the skins separately, as it will be 
less clear. Keep in a cool, dark place.

Let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. — Daniel.

^ ^ ^ 

WHILE not furnishing the most nutritious diet, vege- 
tables contain many nutritive elements in moderate 
degree, are rich in mineral substances, and being composed 
largely of water, perfectly supply many of the needs of the 
human system. Such vegetables, however, as peas, beans, 
and lentils, properly termed legumes, are highly nutritious. 
They are commonly understood to be of the nature of the 
" pulse " upon which Daniel the prophet subsisted in pref- 
erence to the king's meat. While an exclusive diet of ordi- 
nary vegetables might fail to give sufficient nourishment 
to meet the demands of the entire system, their use is valu- 
able in furnishing it with a large quantity of organic fluids, 
and in giving bulk to the food. It is best to combine their 
use with other foods, such as grains, which supply the 
qualities lacking in the vegetables.

Only fresh vegetables should be used. Those which 
are stale can not be made wholesome and palatable by cook- 
ing. Their use imperils the health of the family, and is 
liable to cause serious illness. Herein lies an advantage 
in having one's own garden. 

Care should be taken not to cook vegetables too much 
or too little. They should be neither overdone nor under- 
done, but "just right." Cooking vegetables, grains, and 
fruits is advantageous, as it bursts the particles of starch, 
and thus renders them more easy of digestion. 

While cooking vegetables, a good, steady fire should 
be kept up, and the kettle kept full of hot water for 
replenishing. 

Never replenish with cold water, but always with hot. 

A good rule to follow in cooking vegetables is to put 
to cook in hot water all vegetables that require to have 
the water drained off when done, and in cold water those 
that are to retain it. 

All green vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, etc., 
should be put to cook in boiling, salted water ; the dry 
vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, beans, split peas, and 
lentils should be cooked in un-salted water. About a table- 
spoonful of salt should generally be allowed to a gallon 
of water, or one third of a teaspoonful to every pint of 
cooked vegetables. 

In washing potatoes, a coarse cloth or brush may be 
used to advantage. If to be baked, they should be wiped 
dry before placing in the oven. 

It is a matter of both economy and improvement to 
pare potatoes very thin, as much of the mealiest and most 
nutritious portion lies next to the skin. 

As each potato is pared, it should be dropped into a 
pan of clean, cold water; if allowed to fall back among 



A Friend in the Kitchen 49 

the parings, the potatoes will be dark and 'discolored when 
cooked. 

Potatoes should never be allowed to remain in the 
water in which they have boiled after they are done. It 
should be drained off immediately to prevent their becom- 
ing soggy and water-soaked. If given a few vigorous 
shakes, which allows the steam to escape, they will be much 
more dry and mealy. 

Old potatoes, in the spring, should be allowed to stand 
in cold water for an hour before paring, to reabsorb the 
moisture they have lost through evaporation. 

In baking potatoes the oven should be hot when they 
are put in, and the temperature increased rather than di- 
minished afterward. 

Only dry, ripe, mealy potatoes are good baked. 

Onions should be boiled in two waters, first for about 
fifteen minutes with cold water put on, then drained off, 
and boiling, salted water added to finish. 

To peel tomatoes readily, first pour over them a little 
scalding water. This also appHes to plums.

BOILED POTATOES (without skins) 

Wash, pare thin, and drop into cold water to prevent discol- 
oring. If not of a uniform size, cut the larger ones in two. Put 

to cook in only enough boiling water 
to prevent burning; cook gently from 
twenty to thirty minutes; when done, 
drain off all the water, place over the 
fire for a moment, then give the 
saucepan a vigorous shake, cover with 

a coarse cloth, and set on the back 

Saucepan °f the range to dry. 

Large quantities of potatoes are 
best cooked by steaming over boiling water. 

BOILED POTATOES (with skins) 

Select potatoes of even size; wash clean with a cloth or 
brush, and remove the eyes and specks with a knife; put to 




50 A Friend in the Kitchen 

cook in a small quantity of boiling water; drain when tender, 
and place the saucepan on the back of the range to dry; re- 
move the skins and serve. Potatoes are best cooked in this 
way. Serve in an open vegetable dish. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Choose smooth potatoes of uniform size, wash well, being 
careful to clean the eyes. Dry with a cloth, and bake in a hot 
oven; in a slow oven the skins become thick and hard. Serve 
as soon as done, in an open dish; if covered, they will become 
soggy. B^ked potatoes are very wholesome, and make a good 
breakfast dish. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Wash, pare, and boil the same as boiled potatoes. When 
they can be readily pierced with a fork, drain thoroughly; 
return to the range and mash, using 

the potato masher vigorously for five ci ^ — jt 

or ten minutes, until they are light, 
smooth, and creamy in appearance. p ♦ * lur t, 

A wire potato masher does the work "^^^° Masner 

most satisfactorily. Have warmed in a saucepan a half cupful 
of cream or milk, adding a small piece of butter if milk is used, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and the well-beaten white of one egg; 
beat this into the potatoes until they are very light. Put lightly 
into a warm dish, but do not press down, and serve at once. 
If desired, the e§§ may be omitted. Very nice served with 
cream sauce or brown sauce. 

STEAMED SLICED POTATOES 

Wash, pare, and slice several medium-sized potatoes very 
thin. Have in a frying-pan a small piece of butter and a half 
cup of hot water, put in the potatoes, season with salt, cover 
closely, and set on the back of the range to cook slowly. Stir 
up a little occasionally. A few thinly sliced onions may be 
used with the potatoes if desired. 

WARMED-UP POTATOES 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into thin slices; heat a little milk to 
boiling in a saucepan; put in the potatoes, and season with 
salt to taste. Let boil a few minutes and serve. If desired, the 
milk may be slightly thickened with a little flour blended in a 
little cold milk. 

POTATO PUFF 

Take two cupfuls of hot, seasoned, mashed potatoes, and 
moisten well with hot milk or cream. Beat the yolks and 
whites of two eggs separately; allow the potatoes to cool 
slightly, then beat in the eggs, the yolks first. Turn at once 



A Friend in the Kitchen 51 

into an oiled, shallow tin; do not smooth or press them 
down, but leave in a rocky form. Bake about ten minutes, or 
till a delicate brown. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES 

Cut into dice enough cold boiled potatoes to make one pint, 
brown to a golden yellow a spoonful each of butter or oil and 
minced onion. Add the potatoes, season with salt, and stir with 
a fork till a delicate brown, being careful not to break them. 
Add a spoonful of chopped parsley, and serve hot. 

NEW POTATOES 

If new and fresh, the skins may be easily scraped ofif with a 
knife, or rubbed off with a coarse cloth. Cook in a little water, 
drain, and serve; or, when done, drain, pour some rich, sweet 
milk over them, let it heat to boiling, then thicken with a little: 
flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk, allowing a tablespoon- 
ful of flour to a pint of milk, and season with salt. A few green 
peas cooked with new potatoes and thus dressed make a very 
acceptable dish. 

POTATOES WITH CREAM 

Pare, and cut as many as desired into small cubes; put info 
boiling water and cook from fifteen to twenty minutes; when 
done, drain off all the water, let dry a few minutes over the 
fire, then add a little salt, a cup of thin cream, and a little 
chopped parsley; simmer for two or three minutes, and serve 
at once. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

Choose those of uniform size, wash thoroughly, removing 
any imperfect spots, wipe dry, and place in a moderately hot 
oven; bake for about an hour if the potatoes are rather large. 
Small potatoes are better steamed than baked. Send to the 
table as soon as done, after removing the skins. 

BOILED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash well, put into cold water with the skins on, and boil 

until easily pierced with a fork; drain, remove the skins, and 

place in the oven to dry for five or ten minutes; serve in a hot, 
open dish. 

BROWNED SWEET POTATOES 

Take cold, boiled sweet potatoes, peel, cut into halves, place 
on shallow buttered tins, and brown in a hot oven. 

ROASTED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash, wipe dry, wrap with thin paper, and cover first with 
hot ashes, then with live coals. Turn occasionally. The coals 



52 A Friend in the Kitchen 

may need renewing several times. When done, remove the 
ashes with a brush, wipe with a dry cloth, and serve. Sweet 
potatoes are nicer and more mealy when prepared in this way. 

YAMS 

Prepare the same as roasted sweet potatoes or baked sweet 
potatoes. Boiling them is thought to quite spoil their flavor. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Take nice, fresh tomatoes, pour boiling water over them, 
remove the skins, slice into a granite saucepan, add a cupful 
of water, and stew from twenty to thirty minutes. Then add 
salt, kutter, and a half cup of bread or cracker crumbs, or 
slightly thicken with cornstarch, blended with a little cold 
water. Sugar may be added if desired. 

BAKED TOMATOES 

Select smooth, even-sized, ripe tomatoes. Peel, remove the 
stems, and place in an earthen pudding dish; season with a 
little salt and butter or cream, and bake in a rather hot oven 
for half an hour.

SCALLOPED TOMATOES 

Take one quart of stewed fresh or canned tomatoes, rub 
through a colander, and thicken with a cupful 
of bread or cracker crumbs; add a little salt, 
a few spoonfuls of cream, and bake for twenty 
Can Opener. ov thirty minutes. 

BOILED BEANS 

Pick over, wash, and soak two cupfuls of beans overnight in 
cold water. In the morning drain, and put to cook in hot water. 
Cook slowly for two or three hours, or until perfectly tender, 
adding more hot water as needed, as they should be quite juicy 
when done; avoid much stirring. Season with salt and a little 



A Friend in the Kitchen 53 

butter or cream. Colored beans having too strong a flavor 
may be improved by parboiling for fifteen minutes, then drain- 
ing, and putting to cook in fresh boiling water. 

BOILED BEANS WITH RICE 

Wash and soak two cupfuls of beans in cold water over- 
night; in the morning put to cook, and after about an hour 
add one-half cup of well-washed rice. Cook slowly until done, 
season as above, and serve. 

BAKED BEANS 

Take two cupfuls of beans, pick over, wash, soak overnight, 
and cook the same as boiled beans. When done, add a little 
butter and salt, and two tablespoonfuls of molasses; turn into 
a pudding dish, and bake until nicely browned. A little hot water 
should be added occasionally to prevent their becoming too dry. 

BAKED GREEN BEANS AND CORN 

Shell the beans, and cut the sweet corn from the cob. Put 
layers of each in equal quantities in a bean pot or pan, season- 
ing with salt and butter. Add boiling water to cover, and bake 
in the oven for about two hours, adding more hot water as it 
becomes absorbed. 

MASHED BEANS 

Soak overnight two cupfuls of beans, and cook the same as 
boiled beans. When very tender, and the water nearly ab- 
sorbed, rub through a colander to remove the skins; add half 
a cup of cream or of rich, sweet milk and a little butter; put 
into a shallow dish, smooth the top with a knife or spoon, and 
place in the oven to brown. 

STRING BEANS 

Wash, break oflf each end, stripping the strong fibers from 
end to end. Cut or break into inch lengths, and put to cook in 
enough boiling, slightly salted water to cover. Cook from one 
to two hours, or until very tender, the length of time required 
depending upon the age and variety of the beans. The water 
should be quite absorbed when done. Add a little milk and 
butter if cream is not available. Let come to a boil, and serve. 

SPLIT PEAS 

Look over carefully, wash, and put to cook in a good quan- 
tity of cold water. Let come to a boil, then simmer until 
tender and the water quite absorbed. Press through a colander 
if desired to remove the skins, season with salt, and cream or 
butter, and serve. 



54 A Friend in the Kitchen 

GREEN PEAS 

Shell, and put to cook in boiling, slightly salted water, al- 
lowing one cupful of water to every four cups of peas. If they 
are old, and need longer cooking, add more water if necessary. 
Cover, and cook rather slowly till tender. About thirty rnin- 
utes' cooking for fresh, young peas will be found sufficient. 
When done, pour over a cupful of sweet milk, heat to boiling, 
and thicken with a little flour. Season with a little salt, and a 
spoonful of cream or a small piece of butter. 

LENTILS 

Cook, season, and serve the same as split peas, only less 
water and less time for cooking will be required. 

BAKED RICE 

Take one cupful of rice, wash well by turning into a colan- 
der and dipping in and out of warm water, put into a pudding 
dish, and pour over four cupfuls of milk, or two each of milk 
and water, adding a little salt. Bake about an hour, stirring 
once or twice before the top becomes hard. Serve as a veg- 
etable with lentil sauce. 

PLAIN BOILED RICE 

Wash thoroughly one cupful of rice, and sprinkle it slowly 
into a granite saucepan containing two or three quarts of 
rapidly boiling, slightly salted water. If the grains sink to the 
bottom, stir gently until they keep in motion themselves. Boil 
rapidly, without covering, for thirty minutes, or until soft; 
then drain through a colander and rinse with hot water to 
remove all starch. The grains should be separate and distinct 
from one another. It may be served with a tomato sauce. See 
page 77. 

SPAGHETTI WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Break in pieces and cook in boiling, salted water, or cook 
whole by dipping the ends in the hot water, and as they bend, 
coil them around in the saucepan. Cook for twenty or thirty 
minutes, or until soft, then drain, rinse with hot water to re- 
move starch if it is sticky, turn into a dish and pour over a 
hot tomato sauce, made as directed on page 77. 

STEWED CAULIFLOWER 

Carefuly separate into small portions; examine closely to 
make sure there are no insects on it; let stand a short time in 
cold water, then put into boiling, salted water, and cook from 
twenty to forty minutes, or until tender. Drain, season with a 
little butter or cream, or serve with cream sauce poured over it. 



A Friend in the Kitchen 55 

CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Cook the same as stewed cauliflower. When done, drain, 
turn into a dish, and pour over it a hot tomato sauce. 

STEWED CABBAGE 

Remove the outer leaves, divide into halves, cut very fine 
with a sharp knife, omitting the heart. Put into a saucepan 
with a half cup of boiling water, add a little salt, cover closely, 
and cook until tender, adding a little more hot water, if it be- 
comes too dry before it is done. When done, add a few spoon- 
fuls of cream, allow to heat, and serve. 

BOILED CABBAGE 

Remove the outer leaves, place in cold water for half an 
hour, then quarter, and put to cook in boiling water, adding a 
little salt. Boil vigorously for about thirty minutes; turn into 
a colander, remove the heart and coarse portions, press out all 
the water, return to the saucepan, and season with butter or 
cream; allow to heat, and serve on a hot dish at once. 

BOILED CELERY 

Take one bunch of celery, cut of¥ tops and roots, scrape and 
wash the stalks, then cut them into small pieces, and put to cook 
in boiling water. Let cook for fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
until tender; drain, turn into a heated dish,.. and pour over 
a cream sauce. For making cream sauce see page 77. 

STEWED ASPARAGUS 

Wash, break into small pieces, and cook from twenty to 
thirty minutes in just enough water to cover; when tender, 
drain, add a little butter and salt and a cup of milk; let come 
to a boil, and thicken with a teaspoonful of flour. Boil up and 
serve. 

BOILED CARROTS 

Select small or medium-sized carrots, wash, scrape, rinse in 
cold water, then put to cook in boiling water; cook about thirty 
minutes, or until tender, then drain. Serve as boiled, or slice 
them into a heated vegetable dish, and pour over them a cream 
sauce prepared as directed on page 77. 

BOILED PARSNIPS 

Prepa-re and cook the same as boiled carrots. 

BAKED PARSNIPS 

Wash, scrape, rinse, divide in halves, add a little more than 
enough boiling water to cook them, and boil slowly until ten-

der; place in a shallow dish, pour over the juice that remains, 
add a little salt, a spoonful or two of cream, and place in the 
oven until nicely browned, basting occasionally. 

STEWED TURNIPS 

Pare the turnips, cut into slices, and cook until perfectly 
tender; then drain, mash fine with a spoon or potato masher, 
season with salt, a little butter or cream if desired, and serve. 

SLICED CUCUMBERS 

Pare the cucumbers, slice them very thin into a dish, 
sprinkle with salt, cover loosely, and shake briskly to dis- 
tribute the salt; let stand for about half an hour; then drain off 
all the water, and shortly before serving pour over the juice of 
one or two lemons. A spoonful or two of cream may be added 
if desired. Cucumbers should be thoroughly masticated. Their 
reputed indigestibility is largely due to a failure in this par- 
ticular, 

BOILED ONIONS 

Cut ofiF the tops and bottoms, remove the outer skins, and 
put to cook in cold water; boil fifteen minutes; then drain, and 
cook in boiling, salted water until tender; turn into a pudding 
dish, and cut into small pieces; pour over a cupful of hot cream 
sauce, sprinkle the top with bread crumbs, and bake until 
brown. For making cream sauce see page yy. 

BAKED SQUASH 

Cut into sections, and place shell downward on the top shelf 
of the oven. Bake until tender, and serve hot in the shell; or, 
scrape out the inside, mash, add a few spoonfuls of cream or a 
little butter, and serve. 

STEWED SQUASH 

Peel, remove seeds, cut into small pieces, and stew until ten- 
der in a little boiling water; drain, mash smooth, and season 
with butter and salt. Vegetable marrows may be prepared in 
the same manner, 

SUCCOTASH 

Soak one cupful of beans overnight. When ready to cook, 
add water and one cupful of dried sweet corn, and cook until 
tender. Season with salt, a little cream or butter, and serve. 
If green sweet corn is used, do not add it to the beans until 
they are nearly done. 

BOILED SWEET CORN 

Select full-grown ears, not old and hard, but full of milk; 
remove the husks and silks, and put to cook in enough boiling, 



A Friend in the Kitchen 57 

salted water to cover. Boil from thirty to forty minutes; when 
done, drain, and serve on the cob hot, with a little butter if 
desired. The corn from ears not eaten may be cut from the cob 
and warmed up with a little cream or butter for the next meal. 

STEWED SWEET CORN 

Remove husks and silks, stand the ears in a dish, and with a 
sharp knife cut off the corn from the top downward, taking a 
little more than half of the kernel in depth; then scrape gently 
downward to get the remainder of the milk and meat of each 
kernel. Place in a saucepan, add half a cup of water for each 
quart of corn, and cook for fifteen or twenty minutes. When 
done, add a little salt, a half cup of cream, or a cup of milk and 
a little butter, boil up and serve. The milk may be slightly 
thickened with flour, if desired. 

BAKED BEETS 

Take young, tender beets, wash clean, place in a baking dish 
with a little water, and bake from one to two hours, or until 
tender; add a little hot water occasionally if they become dry. 
When done, remove the skins, slice, and serve with lemon-juice. 

BOILED BEETS 

Cut off the tops, but avoid cutting the beets; put to cook in 
boiling water. When tender, remove to a pan of cold water; 
rub ofif the skins with the hands, slice thin, and serve with 
lemon-juice. 

BEET GREENS 

Take the tops from young, tender beets, look over, put to 
cook in boiling, slightly salted water, and cook until tender; 
then drain in a colander; chop rather fine, and serve with lemon- 
juice. 

SPINACH 

Look over carefully a good quantity of spinach, rejecting all 
wilted and decayed leaves. Wash thoroughly in several waters, 
and put to cook in slightly salted, boiling water, and boil from 
twenty to thirty minutes. When tender, drain in a colander, cut 
into coarse pieces, and put into a warm dish; add a few bits of 
butter, and garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. Serve with 
lemon-juice. 

CELERY 

Remove all the green and decayed parts from the stalks, and 
put into cold water. When ready to serve, place in a celery 
glass with the small ends downward. Curl the tops by cutting 
into narrow strips a little way down. Celery is recommended 
as a good nerve food.

CABBAGE AND TOMATO SALAD 

Cut the cabbage as above, and put into a dish. Peel and slice 
two or three large, ripe tomatoes, and place on the cabbage. 
Toss up lightly in the dish, sprinkle with sugar, and pour over 
all the juice of two lemons. 

LETTUCE SALAD, NO. 1 

Separate the leaves, look over, wash, and put into cold water 
a while before using. When ready to serve, place on a dish and 
pour over a dressing made of equal quantities of lemon-juice, 
sugar, and water. 

LETTUCE SALAD, NO. 2 

Wash and shred two heads of lettuce. Boil two eggs until 
hard, remove the shells, and mash the yolks fine; mix well 
together the juice of one or two lemons, two or three table- 

58 



A Friend in the Kitchen 59 

spoonfuls of water, one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sweet cream, adding this 
last to prevent curdling, and the yolks of the eggs, and pour 
over the lettuce. Cut the whites of the eggs into rings and 
arrange on the top. A spoonful or two of minced onion may 
also be added. 

POTATO SALAD 

Cut into thin slices, hot or cold boiled potatoes, and place in 
a dish without breaking slices. A small onion, chopped fine, to 
each pint of potatoes may be added if desired. Cover with may- 
onnaise dressing. 

VEGETABLE SALAD 

Put a layer of fresh watercress or lettuce into a salad bowl, 
then alternate with layers of peeled, thinly sliced cucumber and 
tomatoes. When enough is prepared, place a border of water- 
cress around the bowl. Just before serving, pour over a French 
dressing, and toss up lightly with a fork till well mingled. 

FRUIT SALAD 

Place in salad dish alternate layers of sliced bananas and 
strawberries, sprinkling each layer with sugar. Cover with 
whipped cream, and serve. 

BANANA SALAD 

Slice crosswise six ripe bananas into a dish; sprinkle with 
powdered sugar, then turn over them the juice of two nice large 
oranges; let stand for an hour in a cool place, and serve. 

NUT AND CELERY SALAD 

Take three cupfuls of finely cut, crisp celery, and one cupful 
of chopped English walnuts; dress with mayonnaise dressing, 
made thin with a little sweet cream. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Mix thoroughly together six tablespoonfuls of oil, a pinch 
of salt, and two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

To the yolks of two fresh eggs add a scant teaspoonful of 
salt; then beat in slowly, almost drop by drop, a small cupful 
of olive-oil. The mixture should become nearly as thick as 
butter. Then gradually add one tablespoonful of lemon-juice. 
Thin with sweet cream. Nice for potato, cabbage, or nut 
salads. If used for tomato salad, omit the cream.

^ ^ ^ 

FROM the instruction given at the beginning respecting 
foods, it is evident the Creator did not design that 
either man or beast should subsist on flesh foods. To 
Adam and Eve he said : " Behold, I have given you every 
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, 
and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding 
seed ; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of 
the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything 
that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have 
given every green herb for meat." Gen. i : 29, 30. 
60 



A Friend in the Kitchen 61 

But sin brought many changes into our world, and 
because of the changed circumstances, customs, and prac- 
tises were instituted and allowed which were not in har- 
mony with the primeval order of things. Among other 
things meat eating was permitted. Just after the flood, 
when the face of the earth had been desolated, God said to 
Noah : " Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for 
3'ou ; even as the green herb have I given you all things." 
Gen. 9 : 3. But the blood was not to be eaten with the 
flesh, — a very wise provision, for if there is any disease 
in the system, it is sure to be found in the blood. 

A little later, as a further precaution in the interests of 
health, instruction was given that only the flesh of " clean 
beasts " was to be eaten, such as that of the ox, the sheep, 
the goat, the deer, etc. See Leviticus 11 and Deuteron- 
omy 14. 

But for all. this it must be admitted that the flesh of 
animals is not a natural diet for man, nor does it consti- 
tute the most healthful food. Of this it may be truly said 
as Christ said of the granting of a writing of divorcement, 
it was suffered because of the " hardness " of their hearts, 
" but from the beginning it was not so." Matt. 19 : 8. It 
was never intended that man should take the life of any 
innocent, living creature. 

Meat eating tends to excite the passions. This is seei^ 
in the animal kingdom. The animals that are mild, patient, 
and docile are generally herbivorous, such as the cow, the 
sheep, the horse ; while the excitable, quick-tempered, and 
ferocious animals are meat eaters, such as the lion, the 
tiger, the leopard. A meat diet also tends to constipation, 
the great scourge of the race. 

One object of this work, therefore, is in the interests 
of health and morality, to educate people out of meat eat- 



62 A Friend in the Kitchen 

ing rather than into it ; and to supply such a variety of 
recipes for good, wholesome, palatable, and nutritious 
dishes, prepared from natural food elements, that meat 
eating will be practically unnecessary. 

Moreover, so many animals at the present time are 
becoming so greatly diseased that it is not a little danger- 
ous to eat largely of their flesh. As a matter of safety the 
use of flesh-meats might very consistently be dispensed 
with altogether. 

The fact, therefore, that meat may be cheap, or that it 
may be easily or quickly prepared, should count for little 
with those who have the best interests of their families in 
view. 

From every standpoint from which the subject may be 
viewed, the reasons for discontinuing the use of flesh-meats 
are more imperative now than ever before. 

1. This is an age of disease. Animals are coming to 
be greatly diseased. The use of their flesh, therefore, tends 
to increase disease in mankind, and thus to shorten life. 

2. This is an age of intemperance. Flesh-meats are 
all more or less stimulating. Their use, therefore, tends to 
increase this evil. 

3. This is an age of surfeiting. Meat eating is, to a 
large degree, responsible for this. A well-known English 
writer on cookery says : " No one will deny that the foods 
we are apt to eat too much of are those absent from a 
purely vegetarian fare, such as meat, game, fish, eggs, 
etc., upon which materials the culinary art seems exercised 
to tempt us beyond the satisfying of the appetite." 

4. This is an age of vice and immorality. A meat diet 
tends greatly to increase this terrible evil. 

5. This is an age of violence and murder. The practise 
of killing and eating animals tends to harden men's hearts, 



A Friend in the Kitchen 63 

to destroy their finer sensibilities, and thus to increase vio- 
lence and crime. 

In the beginning God gave man no flesh foods to eat. 
And after the Exodus, when he had his own way with his 
own people, he gave them no flesh to eat. Before taking 
them into the promised land, for forty years he fed them 
on "manna," a purely vegetarian food. Ex. 16:31; Num. 
11:7, 8. And when they " fell a lusting," and said, " Who 
shall give us flesh to eat ? " he was displeased with them, 
and, with the giving of the quails, brought a great plague 
upon them. Numbers 11 ; Ps. 78:18-31. 

In the New Testament, the apostle, referring to this 
experience, warns Christians against falling into the same 
error. " Now these things," he says, " were our examples, 
to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they 
also lusted. . . . And they are written for our admoni- 
tion, upon whom the ends of the world are come." i Cor. 
10:5-11. 

Evidently, therefore, meat eating is not in harmony 
with God's original plan. And it must be that the nearer 
we bring ourselves into harmony with that plan, the better 
it will be for us. 

To some it may seem difficult to give up the use of 
meat. But in this, as in all reformatory work, much de- 
pends upon the mind. Let the correct principle be first 
assented to ; then, step by step, let the practise be brought 
into conformity to the principle, making changes gradually, 
if necessary, leaving off the meat dishes as others more 
wholesome can be substituted. We should cultivate a love 
for that which we know to be good and healthful. 

To assist those who desire to make this dietetic reform, 
a few recipes are here given which will be found to be 
good substitutes for meats. 



64 A Friend in the Kitchen 

VEGETABLE AND LENTIL STEW 

Soak one-half cup of lentils in a cup of cbld water for an 
hour; then put to cook in three cups of hot water with one 
turnip, three or four -medium-sized potatoes, a small onion, and 
a stalk or two of celery, all cut into small pieces. Stew for 
about half an hour, or until well done, and the water quite 
absorbed. Season with salt, and serve with brown sauce. 

VEGETABLE HASH 

Boil separately in a small quantity of water, three or four 
medium-sized potatoes sliced fine, two turnips, one carrot, and 
an onion, all cut into fine pieces; when done, drain, and turn all 
together into a saucepan; season with salt, add a teaspoonful 
of dry, powdered sage, a half cup of sweet cream, or the same 
quantity of milk, and a small piece of butter, and heat to boil- 
ing; then stir in one or two tablespoonfuls of browned flour 
rubbed to a paste in a little cold water, cook a few minutes 
longer, and serve hot. 

POTATO ROLLS 

Take two potatoes, one turnip, a small onion, a stalk of cel- 
ery, and a little powdered sage; chop all into very fine pieces 
and mix well together, adding salt as desired. Make a paste as 
for pies, roll out rather thin, cut into squares, and place on 
each square as much of the mixture as it will hold; wet the 
edges, and fold up as a sausage roll, pressing the dough together 
at the ends, place in a pan and bake from thirty to forty min- 
utes in a moderate oven. Serve hot. Very nice. 

BREAD STEAK 

Dip slices of stale bread or toast in a little milk or cream 
to slightly soften; sprinkle with a little salt; beat up an egg 
or two, dip in the slices, place in a hot frying-pan with a little 
butter, and brown on both sides. Serve with brown sauce. 

FORCEMEAT FRITTERS 

Rub one tablespoonful of butter into two cupfuls of fine 
breads crumbs, adding a little chopped parsley or other herb 
flavoring, and season with salt; then add one cup of thin cream 
or rich milk, and three eggs beaten separately. Stir well, and 
bake in fritters, in a hot frying-pan, or on a griddle, rubbed 
with a little butter, browning lightly on both sides. Serve with 
brown sauce. 

"PRAIRIE" FISH 

Cut thick, cold, corn-meal mush into slices about half an inch 
thick; roll in flour, and brown on both sides in a hot, buttered 
frying-pan; or brush with thick, sweet cream, and brown in the 
oven.

BOILED MACARONI 

If dusty, wipe with a dry cloth instead of washing, then take 
a cupful broken into small pieces, and put to cook in boiling, 
salted water; cook until tender, adding more hot water occa- 
sionally if necessary. When done, drain, and serve hot with a 
little cream; or pour over a pint of milk, heat to boiling, and 
stir in the yolk of one well-beaten egg and a little salt; or omit 
the egg, and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed 
smooth in a little cold milk. 

PEANUT SAUSAGE 

Thoroughly mix to a cream one level tablespoonful of pea- 
nut butter with two tablespoonfuls of cold water; then add 
three tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs, a pinch of salt, 
and a teaspoonful of minced onion or powdered sage; mix all 
well together, form into small cakes with the hands, and place 
in an oiled, heated frying-pan till nicely browned, turning and 
browning on both sides. Place on a platter, and garnish with 
sprigs of parsley. Serve with brown sauce, No. 2, page 78. 
Very tasty. 

PEAS PUREE 

Soak a cupful or two, or as many as needed, of split peas 
overnight in cold water. In the morning wash, drain, and put 
to cook in boiling water, and cook slowly. When very tender, 
and quite dry, mash smooth, season with salt and a little sweet 
cream. Serve hot. 

STEWED SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS 

Wash, scrape, cut into slices about one fourth of an inch in 
thickness, and drop at once into cold water to prevent discolor- 
ing. Then put to cook in an enameled saucepan, in a small 
quantity of boiling water, about equal parts of water and sal- 
sify, adding a little salt. Cook from twenty to fifty minutes, 
according to age, and when tender add a little more water if 
at all dry, a cupful of cream or rich milk, and simmer for a few 
minutes. Have ready in a dish some slices of toasted bread cut 
in halves, pour over the salsify, and serve. 

LENTIL RISSOLES 

Take equal quantities of well-cooked brown lentils and cold 
boiled potatoes and mash well together; then add one third that 
amount of fine bread crumbs, a teaspoonful each of powdered 
sage and minced onion, and a little salt. Dissolve a teaspoonful 
of nut butter in two tablespoonfuls of hot water^ and add to the 
mixture. Mix all well together, press into an oiled tin, cut into 
squares with a knife, and place in the oven for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Serve hot.

BOILED EGGS 

If desired to have the white set, but the yolk a liquid, boil 
eggs three minutes; then remove from the fire and leave them 
in the hot water a moment or two to set the whites. The water 
should be boiling when the eggs are dropped in. 

If desired to have the yolks dry and mealy, and at the same 
time the whites not hard, tough, and leathery, place the eggs 
in boiling water, then let simmer in water a little below the 
boiling-point, or at a temperature not above 165° Fahrenheit, 
for about twenty minutes. Eggs are best cooked thus. 

For garnishing salads, etc., boil about twenty minutes, then 
immediately place a moment in cold water to prevent the 
whites becoming discolored, and to make the shells remove 
easily. 

POACHED EGGS 

Put into a shallow pan as much hot water as will cover the 
eggs well. A tablespoonful of lemon-juice may be added to the 
water to make the eggs white. Break the eggs one at a time 
into a cup and slip gently into the water, which should not 
boil, but only simmer. Let stand for about five minutes, or 
until the white is firm, but not hard, and the yolk enveloped in 
a film of white. Remove each egg with a skimmer, or large 
spoon, drain, trim the edges, and serve in egg saucers, or on 
toast. Make a thin cream sauce and pour around them if desired.

A Friend in the Kitchen 67 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

For each egg allow two tablespoonfuls of boiling water or 
milk. Break the eggs into a dish, beat lightly with a spoon, 
add a little salt, drop into the boiling water or milk, and stir 
briskly until set, but soft. They are nice thus served on toast. 

STEAMED EGGS 

Break the eggs into egg dishes or oiled patty-pans, sprinkle 
with salt, and steam over boiling water until the whites are set 
and a film covers the yolk. Serve with or without toast. 

SCALLOPED EGGS 

Boil five or six eggs for twenty minutes; remove the shells, 
and cut the eggs into thin slices; put a layer of grated or fine 
bread crumbs into a buttered pudding dish, then a layer of the 
sliced eggs; sprinkle with salt, then add another layer of 
bread crumbs, then another of egg, and so on till the dish is 
filled, having a layer of crumbs for the top. Heat a cup of 
milk to boiling, and pour over the scallop; sprinkle over a few 
more crumbs, and bake until slightly browned. 

BAKED EGGS 

Break the required number of eggs into a shallow baking 
pan, or small patty-pans, previously buttered, to prevent stick- 
ing. Season with salt, and bake until set. Remove to a warm 
platter, and serve at once. 

EGG SANDWICHES 

Mash the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a sprinkle of salt, 
and a little chopped cress, smooth and fine; spread this on thin 
slices of bread slightly buttered, and press together. 

EGGS AND TOMATO SAUCE ^ 

Melt a spoonful of butter in a deep dish, break in carefully 
the number of eggs desired, cind place on the stove until they 
begin to set; then pour over them a hot tomato sauce, made 
after directions on page 77. 

EGGS ON TOAST 

Boil three eggs for twenty minutes. Put one tablespoonful 
of butter into a frying-pan. When hot, stir in one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, and gradually, to 
avoid lumps forming, one cupful of milk. Add the whites of the 
three eggs, chopped fine. When hot, pour over three or four 
slices of moistened toast. Put the yolks through a sieve or 
vegetable press over the toast, garnish with bits of parsley, and 
serve hot. 




Simple diet is best; for many dishes bring many diseases. — 
Pliny. 

PLAIN OMELET 

Beat the yolks and whites of three eggs separately; allow 
one tablespoonful of milk to each egg. Stir the milk and yolks 
of the eggs well together and season with salt; then with a 
spoon carefully fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. 
Turn all into a hot frying-pan, sufficiently buttered to prevent 
sticking. Cook rather quickly, being careful not to burn. Care- 
fully lift the edges of the omelet while cooking, with a knife or 
spoon, that it may be equally cooked. When well set, double 
one part over the other, remove to a warm dish, and serve at 
once, as an omelet is not so good when cold. It should be very 
light and tender, and nicely browned. 

FRUIT OMELET 

Prepare as above, spreading a thin layer of any kind of jelly 
over one half before folding the other half over it; add a 
sprinkle of sugar if desired. 

BREAD OMELET 

For each person allow one egg, three tablespoonfuls of milk, 
and one tablespoonful of finely grated bread crumbs; beat well 
together, and add a little salt, butter a deep plate or shallow pan, 
pour in the mixture, and bake in the oven until well set. 



MACARONI OMELET 

Take a small handful of macaroni broken into small pieces, 
drop into hot water, and boil until tender; drain. Heat a cupful 
of milk to boiling, and stir in two even tablespoonfuls of flour 
rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Stir until thickened; re- 
move from the fire, add the macaroni, a few bits of chopped 
parsley, and four eggs well beaten; season with salt; pour all 
into a hot, buttered dish, sprinkle with a small handful of bread 
crumbs, and place in the oven till nicely browned; then turn 
out on a hot, flat dish, and serve with brown sauce.

all together till transparent, flavor with lemon or vanilla, and 
serve with cream or boiled custard sauce. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING 

Soak one cupful of tapioca overnight in a pint of water. In 
the morning- add one quart of milk, stirring gently, and boil 
about twenty minutes; then add the yolks of four eggs well 
beaten, and one cup of sugar, and boil a few minutes longer; 
pour into an earthen dish, and flavor with a teaspoonful of 
vanilla; cover with a meringue made of the whites of the four 
eggs beaten stiff, and four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
and place in a slow oven to brown slightly. Serve cold. 

RICE PUDDING 

Take a cupful of boiled rice, and a half cup of washed raisins,

the custard is just set. If left in too long, the milk becomes 
watery. This is a good way to use up left-over rice. 

CORNSTARCH PUDDING 

Take three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch and stir smooth in 
a little cold water; over this pour one pint of boiling water; 
then stir in the whites of three eggs beaten stiflf, one table- 
spoonful of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Steam fifteen minutes, 
or cook slowly until thickened. Serve cold with a sauce pre- 
pared as follows: Heat one cup of milk to boiling; beat to- 
gether the yolks of the three eggs and one-half cup of sugar 
until creamy, and stir into the milk; boil until smooth, and re- 
move from the fire at once. Flavor with lemon or vanilla, and 
allow to cool. 

BREAD PUDDING, NO. 1 

Take one pint of bread crumbs, and pour over them one 
quart of milkj then add the yolks of four eggs well beaten, 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and bake in the oven. When done, 
spread the top with jelly or marmalade, and cover with a 
meringue made of the four whites of the eggs beaten stiff, and 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Brown slightly, and 
serve warm or cold, with or without sauce or cream, as pre- 
ferred. 

BREAD PUDDING, NO. 2 

Cut stale bread into cubes, and moisten with milk or water; 
then pour over a mixture of eggs, sugar, and milk, allowing one 
e.gg and one tablespoonful of sugar to each cup of milk. Steam 
or bake. Currants or raisins may be added. 

COLD PEACH PUDDING 

Cut slices of stale bread into strips, and line a pudding basin 
or round mold as neatly as possible. Then fill the center of the 
mold with stewed fresh or canned peaches, slightly warmed, 
add sugar to sweeten, and place a slice of bread over the fruit. 
Pour over enough of the sirup or fruit juice to soak all the 
bread. Take a saucer or plate about the size of the mold, and 
place it upside down on top, over the pudding, and put a heavy 
weight on the plate. Let stand overnight, and in the morning 
turn into a glass dish for the table. Cut into slices, and serve 
with milk or cream. Raspberries or blackberries may be used 
instead of peaches. 

PRUNE WHIP 

Wash thoroughly one-half pound of prunes and soak for an 
hour in cold water enough to cover; cook gently in the same 
water until the prunes are tender, and the juice is nearly ab- 
sorbed. Then rub through a colander. When cold, add two 



A Friend in the Kitchen 71 

tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little lemon-juice, and the stiffly 
beaten whites of three eggs. Stir all well together, pile lightly 
in a buttered pudding dish, and bake about ten minutes, or until 
a delicate brown. Serve with whipped cream or boiled custard 
sauce. See pages yg and 78. 

FIG PUDDING 

Take half a pound of finely chopped figs, one cupful of bread 
crumbs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, one cupful of milk, two eggs well beaten, and a 
pinch of salt. Stir all well together, turn into a double boiler, 
slightly buttered, or into a saucepan placed in boiling water, 
and boil about an hour. Serve with lemon sauce. 

RICE LEMON PUDDING 

To three-fourths cupful of well-washed rice, add three cup- 
fuls of boiling water and a half teaspoonful of salt, and cook 
in a double boiler until tender. When done, allow to cool, then 
add the yolks of three eggs well beaten, a teaspoonful of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, the grated rind of a lemon, 
and one cup of milk; stir together, and bake in the oven until 
set. When done, cover the top with a meringue made with 
the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, two-thirds cup of sugar, and 
the juice of one lemon; place in the oven to brown slightly. 
Serve either warm or cold. 

RICE APPLE PUDDING 

Boil two tablespoonfuls of well-washed rice in half a pint of 
milk until soft; then stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs and 
sugar to sweeten. Make a wall with the rice around a dish; fill 
the center of the dish with stewed apples, and cover the whole 
with the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth; sprinkle 
with powdered sugar, and brown lightly in the oven; serve with 
plain or whipped cream. 

CRACKER PUDDING 

Put three cupfuls of rich milk into a pudding dish; sprinkle 
in two cupfuls of crackers, first heated in the oven till crisp, but 
not browned, and afterward crushed fine with a rolling-pin. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs till light; then mix with one-half 
cup of sugar, and stir in the crackers and milk; add one cup of 
well-washed currants or seedless raisins, and flavor with grated 
lemon peel if desired. Bake in the oven until set; beat the 
whites of the eggs till stiff, add one tablespoonful of white sugar, 
and spread this over the top of the pudding; return to the oven 
till a delicate brown. 

ALMOND RICE PUDDING 

Put one cupful each of well-washed rice and raisins into a 
pudding dish with six cupfuls of almond milk, one-third cup of 



72 A Friend in the Kitchen 

sugaf, and a pinch of salt. Bake in a moderate oven till tender, 
stirring up several times during the first ten minutes. Serve 
cold. 

CORNSTARCH BLANC-MANGE 

To one quart of milk add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
heat just to boiling; then stir in five tablespoonfuls of corn- 
statch mixed thoroughly with two well-beaten eggs; flavor with 
lemon or vanilla, and pour into cups, previously wet in cold 
water, to mold. Place a mold of jelly in the center of a platter, 
and arrange the molds of blanc-mange around it. A portion of 
the blanc-mange may be colored and flavored with chocolate, 
so that each alternate mold on the platter will be brown. Serve 
with cream. 

APPLE BATTER PUDDING 

Pare and slice six medium-sized cooking apples into a but- 
tered pudding dish, adding sugar to sweeten. Make a batter 
as follows: Beat three eggs to a foam; then add five tablespoon- 
fuls of sifted flour, sprinkling it in while beating vigorously, and 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Stir in gradually enough milk to 
make of the consistency of thick cream, beat well, and pour 
over the apples, and bake until done. Serve with cream or rich 
milk. 

APPLE TRIFLE 

Pare, quarter, core, and stew six or eight apples to a pulp, 
adding the juice and grated rind of a lemon. When done, add 
sugar to sweeten, and turn into a deep glass dish. Heat a pint 
of milk to boiling, stir in three well-beaten eggs, saving out the 
white of one, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and cook until 
thickened. When cold pour over the apples in the dish. Beat 
the white of the egg to a stiff froth and drop by spoonfuls into 
a pan of boiling water for a moment, turn, then remove, and 
use to ornament the pudding. 

APPLES WITH TAPIOCA 

Soak a cupful of tapioca in two cupfuls of cold water for an 
hour; then spread on a clean white cloth, and place some pared 
and sliced apples, sugar, and grated lemon peel in the center; 
tie up the cloth loosely so that the tapioca will surround the

ONE of the greatest objections to pies is that they are 
generally made too rich. When a large amount of 
grease is employed in making the crust, and the filling is 
seasoned heavily with spices and various condiments, they 
can hardly fail to be unwholesome. 

But pies need not be made in this way. If proper mgre- 
dients are used, and simplicity is studied in making them, 
there is no reason why they should be seriously objection- 
able. 

There are two styles of pie in general use, — one, the 

English style, baked in a deep dish, fre- 

^) quently with only a top crust; the other, 

the American, baked in a shallow dish, 

Pie Dish usually with two crusts, an upper and an 

under. Custard, cream, lemon, and pumpkin pies, however, 

have only an under crust. Most of the recipes here given 

are for the shallow pies with two crusts. 

Custard, pumpkin, and other pies in which milk and 
eggs are used, should be baked in a slow oven. They will 
80 




A Friend in the Kitchen 81 

also be improved if the milk used be hot. To stir beaten 
eggs into the hot milk, add. a few spoonfuls of cold milk 
to the eggs, then pour into the hot milk, a little at a time, 
stirring well. 

The filling for pies should always be prepared before 
making the crust, unless the crust is to be baked first. All 
the material should be cold, except for custard and pumpkin 
pies, and should be put together quickly, handling as little 
as possible, and without kneading the dough. 

When the paste is ready, take sufficient for one crust, 

and roll out on a floured board quickly and lightly until 

about an eighth of an inch 

© in thickness, and a little. 

larger than the pie dish, 
Rolling^pm ^g .^ ^jlj gj^j.j^j^ ^^^^ 

lifted from the board. When rolled thin, flour or oil the 
pie dish, cover smoothly with the crust, and fill, adding 
sugar as required. Sprinkle a little flour over the sugar; 
this thickens the juice slightly, and prevents the upper crust 
from becoming soggy. For custard or fruit pies with wet 
fillings, brush the bottom crust with the white of an &gg 
before putting in the filling. The crust will then remain 
dry and tender. 

If there is to be a top crust, roll it out in the same 
manner, and make a few ornamental cuts 
in the center to allow the steam to escape. 
Wet the edge of the lower crust, and lift 
on the upper crust, pressing the edges "^^ 

together so that the juice may not escape. Trim away the 
overhanging portions, and with the thumb and fingers 
press the edge into a scalloped or ornamental wall, as 
shown in the accompanying cut. Especially should this 
be done when only an under crust is used, that the pie may 
6 




82 A Friend in the Kitchen 

be handled with greater ease. It also adds to the appear- 
ance of the pie. Pies are generally better eaten the same 
day they are baked. 

J^ )ii «« 

PLAIN PIE CRUST 

For each pie with two crusts take two small cups of sifted 
flour, and work thoroughly into it three tablespoonfuls of butter, 
adding a little salt; wet with just sufficient cold water to make a 
rather stiff dough; mix quickly, roll out thin, and bake as soon 
as the pie can be made. A good crust may be made with olive- 
oil, or fresh cocoanut or vegetable oil, instead of butter, using 
about the same quantity. 

CREAM PIE CRUST 

Take two scant cups of fine, sifted flour, or equal parts of 
fine flour and Graham flour, add a little salt, and moisten with 
enough cold, thin sweet cream to make a rather stiff dough; 
roll out thin, place in the pie dish, fill, and bake quickly. 

APPLE PIE 

Pare, core, and slice thin, tart ripe apples; line the pie dish 
with a crust, and fill with the apples; sprinkle with sugar, and 
add two or three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Cover with an 
upper crust, according to general directions, and bake until a 
light brown. Apples that do not cook quickly may be stewed 
until about half done before making into pies. Apple pie when 
cold is very nice served with sweet cream. 

PEACH PIE 

Pare, remove stones, and make the same as apple pie. 
GOOSEBERRY PIE 

Remove the stems and blossom ends^ wash^ and fill a pie 
dish lined with a crust. Add a half cup of sugar, and sprinkle 
with flour. Prepare the upper crust, cover, and bake. To pre- 
vent the juice from running out while baking, make a paste of 
a teaspoonful of flour and a little water, and brush over the 
edge of the under crust before putting on the top crust. If 
desired, beat together the white of an egg and a tablespoonful 
of fine sugar, and meringue the top of the pie when done; 
return to the oven, and brown slightly. 

RHUBARB PIE 

Wash, strip off the skin, and cut the stalks into thin slices. 
Line a pie dish with crust, and fill with the rhubarb. Add a 



A Friend in the Kitchen 83 

half cup of sugar, two or three tablespoonfuls of water, and 
sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour. Wet the edges of the 
lower crust, place on a prepared top crust, press the edges to- 
gether, trim, and bake. Equal portions of rhubarb and apples 
may be used in the place of all rhubarb. 

RASPBERRY PIE 

Look over the raspberries, line a pie dish with a crust and 
fill with berries; add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little water, 
sprinkle with flour, and proceed as with gooseberry pie. 

BLACKBERRY PIE 

Look over about one pint of blackberries, and proceed the 
same as for raspberry pie. Blueberry pie may be made in the 
same way. 

CHERRY PIE 

Take nice ripe cherries, remove the stones if preferred, and 
make the same as raspberry pie, adding sugar according to the 
acidity of the fruit. 

DRIED CURRANT PIE 

Wash the currants in two or three waters through a colander 
to remove sand and grit, and stew; when cool, line a pie dish 
with crust, and fill with the currants, pouring in a small quan- 
tity of the juice; add a little sugar, then sprinkle over with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, cover with a crust, and bake in a hot 
oven till done. It should not be made too dry. 

PRUNE PIE 

Wash the prunes well in warm water, rinse, soak, and put 
to cook without draining, cover, and stew slowly from one to 
two hours. When done, put through a colander to remove 
stones and skins. Bake with two crusts. Very little sugar will 
be needed. If the pulp is quite juicy, a tablespoonful of flour 
may be sprinkled over. 

LEMON PIE 

To one cupful of boiling water, add one heaping tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch blended with a little cold water. Boil up, 
remove from the fire, and stir in two-thirds cup of sugar; let 
cool, then add the beaten yolks of two eggs, and the juice and 
grated rind of a lemon. Bake with under crust only; when 
done, meringue the top with a tablespoonful of sugar and the 
whites of the eggs beaten stifif; return to a slow oven to brown 
slightly. 

DRIED APPLE PIE 

Take good dried apples, wash, and soak for several hours, or 
overnight, in sufficient cold water to cover them. Stew, with- 



84 A Friend in the Kitchen 

out draining, until soft; mash fine, adding lemon flavoring and 
sugar to sweeten; bake with two crusts, or ornament with strips 
or lattice-work crust on top. A few stewed blackberries or 
raspberries may be added to the apples. 

DRIED PEACH PIE 

Stew until soft, mash to a pulp, add sugar to sweeten, and 
make the same as dried apple pie. If desired, one-third apricots 
may be used. 

RAISIN PIE 

For three pies, stew one pound of raisins for nearly an hour 
in enough water to cover them; add the juice of a lemon, and 
a small cup of white sugar. Line the pie dishes with crust, fill 
with raisins and a little of the juice, and sprinkle two table- 
spoonfuls of flour over each pie. Bake with two crusts. For 
lemon raisin pie add the juice and grated rind of one lemon. 

CREAM PIE 

Put one cup of milk to scald in a double boiler. Beat to- 
gether two eggs, leaving out the white of one, two even tea- 
spoonfuls of sifted flour stirred smooth in a little cold milk, and 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar. When the milk is scald- 
ing hot, add this mixture, and stir for a minute or two until it 
thickens. It is better not to cook after it is thick, and the less 
it is stirred, except to keep it from forming into lumps, the 
better; add vanilla or lemon to flavor. Line the pie dish with 
a crust, pricking well with a fork to prevent blistering, and 
bake in a quick oven; then put the cream, which is already suffi- 
ciently cooked, into the baked crust. Beat the white of the egg 
to a stiff froth with a tablespoonful of sugar, and spread on 
top of the pie. Place in the oven to brown slightly. 

CUSTARD PIE 

Line a pie dish with a crust, and fill with the following: 
Three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one teaspoonful 
of flour; beat thoroughly together, and add milk enough to fill 
the dish. Bake slowly until set, but do not allow to boil. As 
soon as it pufifs, and a knife can be cut into the custard and 
come out clean, it is done. To be eaten cold, and on the same 
day as baked. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

Cut the pumpkin in halves, remove the seeds, cut in slices, 
and stew until dry and soft. Mash smooth, and for each pie 
take one cup of stewed pumpkin, one-third cup of sugar, two 
eggs, and about a pint of milk. Beat the eggs and sugar to- 
gether, stir in the pumpkin, and, lastly, add the milk; mix well, 
and bake with an under crust only, until the custard is set. 
Squash may be used instead of pumpkin. If more convenient, 



A Friend in the Kitchen 85 

two tablespoonfuls of flour may be used in place of the eggs. 
A tablespoonful or. two of molasses may also be added if 
desired.

What brightens the eye,

Like a good pumpkin pie? — Whittier. 

PIE WITH UPPER CRUST ONLY 

Take a deep pie dish, place a small cup upside down in the 
middle of it, and fill the dish with fruit, adding sugar as desired. 
Place a- border of crust around the edge of the dish, put on the 
top crust, ornament the edges, and bake. 

TARTS 

Line shallow pie dishes or patty-pans with good crusts, fill 
with the fruit, and bake. When done, remove from the oven, 
and sprinkle with fine sugar. 

Small tarts may be made by rolling crust out thin, and cut- 
ting in shapes with a cake cutter, using half of them for the 
under crust, and the other half for tops; ornament the tops by 
cutting small holes in the center with a thimble or small fancy 
mold. Bake quickly, and when done put together with fruit 
jelly. 

VEGETABLE PIE 

Boil for a short time several potatoes and onions, after which 
slice them into a deep, buttered pie dish in layers; add to each 
layer a little sage and well-steeped tapioca, and season with 
salt. Cover with a crust and bake. A very economical and 
wholesome pie. 

SAVORY PIE 

Soak one-half cup of tapioca in one cup of cold water for 
one hour. Moisten enough stale bread in cold water to make 
three cupfuls; put into a dish, and rub in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one of flour. Then mix in one-half cup of stewed 
fresh or canned tomatoes, two beaten eggs, one small onion 
chopped fine, one tablespoonful of powdered sage, and salt to 
taste. Put into a buttered pudding dish and pour over the 
tapioca. Boil two eggs until hard, remove shells, cut into slices, 
and place on top of the tapioca; add a few bits of butter, cover 
with a crust, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty or thirty 
minutes. Serve hot. 

MERINGUE FOR PIES 

To each stiffly beaten white of an tg^, add a tablespoonful 
of sugar, and spread on the pie after it is baked and allowed to 
cool slightly; place in the oven for a few minutes. Care should 
be taken that the oven is not too hot, or the covering will be 
tough and leathery.

IT is important that all the necessary materials should be 
gathered together before beginning the cake. If baking- 
powder is used, allow a teaspoonful to each cup of flour; 
sift it in the flour, and measure the sugar; have the pans 
for baking in readiness. Beat the whites and yolks of eggs 
separately in china bowls, using a 

ll ^^^^^;.. . ^ ^ ^^ Dover egg-beater. The whites should 

'^/^^^^^^^^J be beaten till stiff enough to cut with 
a knife, the yolks till they cease to 
froth and begin to thicken. Cream 
the butter by beating it, first warming the dish by rinsing 
with hot water, if the weather is cold. Then add the sugar 
slowly, then the beaten yolks of eggs; add a little of the 
milk, then a part of the flour, thus alternating with the milk 
and flour till all are used, being careful to have the mixture 
always of about the same consistency.

Next fold in the stiffly beaten whites, add flavoring if 
desired, and beat for a few moments. If fruit is used, fold 
it in, well floured, the last thing, or it will sink to the bot- 
tom of the cake. 

The baking is an important part of cake-making. The 
oven should be at a proper temperature ; if too hot at first, 
the cake browns too quickly, and a crust is formed over the 
top before the cake has sufficient time to rise ; if not hot . 
enough, the air that has been beaten in escapes before the 
heat has time to expand it; the result is that the cake is 
coarse-grained and heavy. 

Have the oven less hot for cake than for bread, but 
hotter for thin cake than for loaf cake. It is about right 
for loaf cake made with butter when it turns a piece of 
writing-paper a light brown in five minutes. About an 
hour will be required to bake a loaf cake: from fifteen to 
twenty minutes for small cakes and layer cakes. 

A tube cake pan, as shown in the accompanying cut, is 
very good for baking ordinary cakes, 
as the tube causes the cake to bake 
more evenly, and renders it less liable 
to fall. 

Cake Pan If it is necessary to move the cake 

after putting it in the oven, it should be done carefully, as 
jarring is liable to make it fall. A cake is done when a 
clean broom straw passed through the thickest part comes 
out clean. 

If a cake rises up, cracks open, and remains that way, 
it has baked too fast, or too much flour has been used. To 
bake properly, it should rise first on the edges, then in the 
middle, crack open slightly, then settle till level, when it will 
have closed nearly together again. The outside should be a 
golden brown, the inside slightly moist, and fine grained.

In beating the yolks of eggs where both eggs and milk 
are used, first rinse the bowl in which the yolks are to be 
beaten with a little of the milk. 

In beating the whites of the eggs, do not stop until they 
are stiff, as they can not be beaten stiff after standing till 
they have become liquid again. Eggs will beat stiffer if cold, 
and beaten in a cold dish and in a cool room. 

Jelly for filling should be beaten till smooth, then spread 
between the layers before they are quite cool. In using des- 
sicated cocoanut, first moisten it with a little sweet cream. 

Citron used in cake should be cut into fine strips. Cur- 
rants and raisins should be looked over, washed, dried, and 
then be well floured before being added to the cake, as they 
absorb moisture and tend to make the cake heavy. Rich cake 
should be avoided. Sponge cake may be considered the 
most healthful. 

To make sponge cake, beat the yolks till thick and light- 
colored, then beat in the sugar, add lemon-juice, or other 
liquid and flavoring to be used. Then add the stiffly beaten 
whites, sift in the flour over them, and fold all in together 
without stirring or beating. Beating sponge cake after 
adding the flour makes it firm and tough, as also does the 
addition of too much flour. Sponge cake should be put 
together lightly and quickly, and baked at once. 

SPONGE CAKE 

Beat the yolks of three eggs; then gradually add one cupful 
of granulated sugar, one tablespoonful each of cold water and 
lemon-juice. Add the beaten whites and one cupful of flour, 
following general directions for making sponge cake as given 
above. 

LEMON SPONGE CAKE 

Take four eggs, one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of lemon- 
juice, with a little of the grated rind, and one cupful of flour. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs to a foam, then beat in the sugar, 
adding a little at a time; then add the lemon-juice and grated

rind; beat the whites of the eggs until very stiff, then lightly 
fold and chop them into the mixture. Slowly sift in the flour, 
carefully working it in. Do not beat after the flour has been 
added. Bake in two layers, and put together with fruit jelly or 
lemon honey. See page 40. 

SPONGE LOAF CAKE 

Break ten eggs into a large bowl, add two large cupfuls of 
granulated sugar, and beat together for half an hour without 
pausing. Then add one cupful of sifted flour, the juice and 
grated rind of one lemon, and one-fourth cup of cold water. 
Turn into deep pans, sprinkle the top lightly with powdered 
sugar, and bake about an hour in a moderate oven. 

GEM CAKES 

Beat to a foam the yolk of one egg, one cup of sugar, and 
one cup of cold, thin, sweet cream; a little grated lemon rind 
may be added for flavoring. Stir in slowly, beating thoroughly, 
two cupfuls of flpur into which a heaping tablespoonful of corn- 
starch has been sifted. Beat until light and smooth; then add 
the well-beaten whites of two eggs, stirring just enough to mix 
them in. Turn into oiled, heated gem irons, and bake in a rather 
quick oven. 

RICE CAKES 

Separate four eggs; add a pinch of salt to the whites, beat 
until stiflf, then set in a cool place. Beat the yolks for several 
minutes, then slowly add one cupful of sugar, beating continu- 
ously; carefully fold in the beaten whites, and lastly add one- 
half cup of flour, sifted before measuring, and mixed with one- 
half cup of ground rice; work in carefully, and quickly turn the 
mixture into oiled patty-pans, or drop by spoonfuls into a large 
oiled baking pan, and bake in a quick oven. 

CREAM CAKE 

One cupful each of sugar and sweet milk, one &gg, one table- 
spoonful of butter, two cupfuls of flour, and two teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder. Put together according to general directions. 
Bake in three layers, and put together with a filling made as 
follows: Heat one cupful of mik to boiling; to this add one- 
fourth cup of sugar, one dessertspoonful of flour rubbed smooth 
in a little cold milk reserved for this purpose, and one well- 
beaten egg; 'boil until thickened, let cool a little, and spread 
between the layers. 

NUT CAKE 

One and one-half cups of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two eggs, two cupfuls of flour, with two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, and one cupful of milk. Put together according to gen- 
eral directions. Lastly, stir in one cupful of chopped nuts, and 
bake in a moderate oven.

FAVORITE CAKE 
Beat together for nearly an hour one cupful each of flour 
and rice flour, twelve eggs, two cupfuls of sugar, and a spoonful 
of caraway seeds. Bake in a tube cake pan. 

LAYER CAKE 

One and one-half cups sugar, half cup of butter, three eggs, 
half cup of milk, and two heaping cups of sifted flour, with two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in three layers, and put 
together with a boiled frosting to which a cupful of chopped 
nuts or raisins may be added. 

DELICATE CUP CAKE 

Take two eggs, beaten separately, one cup of sugar, one cup 
of rich milk, two cups of flour, and teaspoonful of vanilla. Make 
according to general directions; bake in patty pans, or gem irons. 

RAISED FRUIT CAKE 

Take one cup of light bread dough when ready for the pans, 
put into a dish, and work into it one-half cup of oil or butter, 
one egg well beaten, one cup of sugar, one-half cup of milk, 
one and one-half cups of flour, and lastly one cup of English 
currants or seedless raisins, chopped fine. Turn into an oiled 
bread tin, let rise in a warm place for about an hour and a half, 
or until light, then bake for nearly an hour in a moderate oven. 

FROSTING FOR CAKE 

Beat the white of one egg until stiff, add a teaspoonful of 
lemon-juice, then gradually add one scant cup of powdered 
sugar; beat very hard; flavor as desired. To color it a delicate 
pink, add a little currant or strawberry juice; a yellow tint may 
be obtained by grating orange or lemon rind, and using two 
tablespoonfuls of the juice, first straining through a cloth. 

BOILED FROSTING 

Without stirring boil one cupful of sugar and two table- 
spoonfuls of water in a saucepan until clear; then pour it upon 
the stifily beaten white of an egg, stirring well together, and 
spread over the cake with a knife, which dip frequently into cold 
water. 

CREAM ICING 

To two tablespoonfuls of cream and one teaspoonful of va- 
nilla or other flavoring add enough confectioner's sugar to make 
it stiff enough to spread. Orange, or other fruit juice, may be 
used in place of the cream. 

ORANGE ICING 

Beat the yolk of one egg and add the juice and grated rind 
of one orange and enough confectioner's sugar to make it stiff 
enough to spread.

CORN COFFEE 

Brown common field corn as brown as pos- 
sible without burning; then pound, or grind 
coarsely in a coflfee-mill, and place in a covered 
can ready for use. In making the cofifee, mix the 
white of an egg with three tablespoonfuls of the 
ground grain, pour over three or four cups of 
boiling water, and steep for ten or fifteen min- 
utes. Serve with cream and sugar. 

Peas, wheat, barley, or rice may be prepared 
in the same way. 

HOT MILK 

Heat the milk in a double boiler until the surface becomes 
wrinkled. It should be drunk a few sips at a time. A bowl of 
hot milk and brown bread forms a nourishing meal. 

CAMBRIC TEA 

Take a cup of boiling water, add a little cream, and sugar 
to sweeten. A simple but pleasant and wholesome drink. 

EGG-NOG 

Beat one egg and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar to a 
foam; add the juice of half a lemon, pour into a glass and fill 
up with cold water.

Beat well together the yolk of one egg and a tablespoonful 
of sugar; add one-half cup of hot milk or water, and the white 
of the egg beaten to a stiff froth; stir lightly, and serve. 

LEMONADE, NO. 1 

Roll the lemons till soft; cut into halves, and 
with a lemon drill squeeze out sufficient juice to 
make one cupful; add to this one cupful of white 
sugar; as soon as the sugar dissolves, add about 
two quarts of water, and serve. For lemon frappe

and from four to six tablespoonfuls of white sugar. Pour over 
enough hot water to make a quart in all; cover at once, and 
let stand until cold; or pour over a spoonful or two of boiling 
water to dissolve the sugar, and add the necessary quantity of 
cold water.

HOT LEMONADE 

To the juice of each lemon add a cupful of boiling water, 
and sweeten to taste. Excellent for a cold. 

ORANGEADE 

Choose nice, juicy, ripe oranges, and make the same as Lem- 
onade Nos. I and 2, only using less sugar. This will be found 
a much nicer drink than many imagine. Try it. 

FRUIT JUICE LEMONADE 

To a pint of lemonade prepared according to foregoing 
recipes, add a half cup of strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, or 
currant juice. This gives a nice color to* the lemonade, besides 
improving its flavor. 

PINEAPPLE LEMONADE 

Make the lemonade as indicated above, and flavor with a 
few spoonfuls of pineapple juice. 

GRAPEADE 

Take two pounds of thoroughly ripe purple grapes, crush, 
and strain the juice through a coarse cloth or jelly-bag. Add 
to the juice three tablespoonfuls of white sugar, and dilute with 
sufficient cold water to suit the taste. 

FRUIT JUICE DRINKS 

Take a small quantity of the juice of any stewed or canned 
fruit. Dilute with water, and add sugar according to the acid- 
ity of the juice. When fruit juice is not available, similar drinks 
may be made by dissolving fruit jelly in warm water, and al- 
lowing to cool. Such drinks are especially refreshing for the 
sick. 

FRUIT PUNCH 

Boil two pounds of sugar and three quarts of water for five 
minutes. Then strain, and add to it the juice of two lemons 
and two oranges, and one pint of freshly grated pineapple. Let 
stand for an hour or two, then add sufficient shaved ice to make 
it palatable, a cupful of halved strawberries, a few raspberries, 
and serve. 

BUTTERMILK 

If rich and thick, drop into it a piece of ice; or if not, place 
on ice till cool. This is a very healthful drink, for, after the 
butter, which is the carbonaceous or heat-producing element, is 
removed, a most refreshing, nourishing quality remains.

THE world is in need of knowledge how to prepare 
and use simple, inexpensive, healthful foods. As 
diseases increase in the animal creation, it will be more 
and more necessary for those who desire to preserve their 
health to come back to the diet originally given to man, — 
a diet consisting chiefly of fruits, grains, and nuts, and 
various legumes, roots, and herbs. At the rate disease is 
increasing at the present time, it will not be long before 
it will be unsafe to use animal products of any kind. It 
is well, therefore, for all to learn how to prepare foods 
without them. 

Various nut, cereal, and legume preparations well supply 
the place of flesh-meats. The different nut and vegetable 
oils take the place of butter, cream, and other animal fats. 

In the use of nuts, care should be taken not to use them 
too freely, as they are a very rich and concentrated form 

94 



A Friend in the Kitchen 95 

of food. Eaten sparingly in their natural state in connec- 
tion with the meals, or properly combined with other less 
concentrated foods, they fill an important place in a natural 
dietary. 

A little experience in the use of vegetable oils will 
convince any one that they are not only palatable, but far 
more cleanly and wholesome than many of the ordinary 
fats used in cooking. 

The following recipes are designed to aid especially in 
preparing foods in this manner : — 

PEANUT BUTTER 

Put the shelled peanuts in a pan in a slow 
oven, leaving the door slightly ajar; allow to 
stay in till so dry that the hulls will rub oflE 
easily, but in no case allow to brown or burn. 
When sufficiently dry, put into a bag, tie up 
closely, and knead or roll on a table with the 
hands until the husks are well loosened; sepa- 
rate the husks from the nuts by turning from 
one pan into another in the wind. Grind, and 
cook for several hours in a double boiler with 
no water added to the nuts. Put away to use Universal Chopper 
as occasion requires. and Nut-Batter Mill 

PEANUT CREAM 

Mix one tablespoonful of nut butter with two or three spoon- 
fuls of water to a smooth cream; then add one-half cupful of 
water, a little salt, and stir well together. 

PEANUT MILK 

Make the same as peanut cream, only add more water. 

ALMOND BUTTER 

Pour boiling water over the shelled nuts, and let stand from 
three to five minutes; then drain, and slip ofif the husks with 
thumb and finger. Put in a warm place till thoroughly dry; 
grind, and put away for future use. 

ALMOND MILK AND CREAM 

Proceed the same as with peanut cream and milk, only using 
a little more water.

COCOANUT MILK AND CREAM 

Select good cocoanuts with milk in them. Let the milk out 
of the soft eye; then, holding the nut in the left hand, strike

Cocoanut Scraper ^ju ^reak in halves. 

Grate on an iron or steel cocoanut scraper, made as shown in 
accompanying cut, placing the scraper board across a chair, 
with a pan upon the floor to catch the grated nut, while the 
operator sits upon the board, takes half of the broken nut in 
the hollow of both hands, scraping it back and forth over the 
sharp teeth till all the meat has been finely scraped from the 
shell. For each grated nut pour over a quart of hot water; stir 
well, then squeeze and strain through a strong, coarse cloth. 
Empty the cocoanut from the cloth into a saucepan, pour over 
a little more hot water, stir, and strain through the cloth a 
second time, to get out all the milk. This makes cocoanut milk. 
Using half the quantity of water makes good cream; or let the 
milk stand an hour and skim ofif the top for thick cream. 

COCOANUT-OIL 

Cocoanut-oil can generally be purchased in the market from 
wholesale druggists, though it is sometimes difficult to get that 
which is not rancid. It can be made by taking the cream from 
a half dozen or dozen nuts, treated as above, only allowing the- 
milk to stand over night before skimming, and boiling the 
cream in an iron vessel, without stirring, until all the water is 
evaporated. When done, the sediment will be found browned, 
and adhering to the bottom of the vessel. Bottle, and set away 
for use. 

Ko-nut is a pure, refined cocoanut-oil, which does not turn 
rancid, and is, therefore, very nice, and far preferable to the 
cocoanut-oil ordinarily obtainable for cooking purposes. 

VEGETABLE OIL 

There are various good cooking oils, among which may be 
mentioned Wesson's Cooking Oil, and Fairbank's White Cook- 
ing Oil, both refined products of cottonseed-oil. Olive-oil may 
also be used in cooking. 

HOME-MADE GRANOLA 

Take slices of brown, white, or whole wheat bread, place in 
a moderate oven until a light brown, break in pieces, and grind 
coarsely through a mill. Or, take a cup each of wheaf-meal 
and white flour, one-half cup each of corn-meal and rolled oats 
or corn-meal and rye flour, and enough cold water to make a 
stiflf dough; knead well, roll thin, cut in squares, and bake until 



A Friend in the Kitchen 97 

dry and brittle; grind coarsely, and_ serve with thin cream, hot 
or cold milk, cocoanut milk, or fruit juice; or to each pint of 
boiling milk or water stir in one cupful of granola, add a little 
salt, cook a few minutes, and serve. 

NUTMEAT 

Take one cup of peanut butter, one and one-half cups hot 
water, three heaping tablespoonfuls of gluten, and one level tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix all well together, and cook in a double 
boiler from four to five hours. A small onion grated fine and a 
teaspoonful of powdered sage may be added if desired. 

PROTOSE STEAK 

Cut protose into slices half an inch thick. Lay on an oiled 
tin and place in the oven until nicely browned. 

PROTOSE CUTLETS 

Take one pound of protose and cut into slices three or four 
inches long and one inch wide, lay on an oiled tin, and place 
in the oven till well heated; have ready an egg well beaten, to 
which add a sprinkle of salt; take the protose from the oven, 
and dip each piece in the beaten egg, then roll in fine bread 
crumbs, place back on the pan, and set in the oven until nicely 
browned. 

NUT GRAVY 

Blend one tablespoonful of nut butter with a little water; 
stir it into a pint of boiling water; salt, and thicken with two 
tablespoonfuls of browned flour moistened with cold water; 
boil five or ten minutes. A few spoonfuls of stewed, strained 
tomatoes will improve it. Nice with vegetables or toasts. 

EGGS IN NEST ON ZWIEBACK 

Take six eggs, or as many as required, break, and separate, 
by putting all the whites in one bowl and each yolk in a cup 
by itself containing a spoonful or two of cold water. Moisten 
six slices of zwieback by pouring over them hot water and 
quickly draining, and place side by side in a large shallow 
baking pan. Beat the whites of the eggs until very stiff, and 
place an equal amount on top of each slice of zwieback. Make 
a hollow in the center of the whites, lift the yolks out of the 
water from the cups with a tablespoon, being careful not to 
break them., and place a yolk in each hollow. Sprinkle over a 
little salt, and place in the oven until the whites are a delicate 
brown. Serve as soon as done. A nice dish for the sick.

FOOD for the sick should generally be of a very simple 
character. It should be such as will furnish the most 
nourishment with the least tax upon the digestive organs. 
It should be prepared with care and scrupulous cleanliness, 
well cooked, and served in the most inviting manner. Cover 
the tray with clean white linen, and use the daintiest dishes 
the house affords. 

Other dishes suitable for the sick may be found among 
the Toasts, Breads, Fruits, Wholesome Drinks, etc.

OATMEAL WATER AND MILK 

For an infant under three months, put one tablespoonful of 
fine oatmeal into a pint of boiliiig water, boil for an hour, re- 
plenishing with boiling water to keep the quantity good; strain, 
and add one cup of sterilized milk. Feed in bottle. For infants 
from three to six months, use equal portions of milk and oat- 
meal water, and after six months, two-thirds milk. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTHER'S MILK, NO. 1 

Take one ounce cow's milk, two ounces cream, three drams 
milk sugar, one grain bicarbonate of soda, and one ounce of 
water. Increase the quantity of milk and cream as the child 
gets older. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTHER'S MILK, NO, 2 

Take one tablespoonful of cream, four of milk, two of lime- 
water, and four of sweetened water. Sugar of milk, two ounces 
to a pint of water, is preferable to ordinary sugar for preparing 
the sweetened water. This will generally agree with the most 
delicate stomach. 

WHITE OF EGG AND WATER 

Stir well the white of an egg into a cupful of as warm water 
as can be used without coagulating the egg. Good for infants 
suffering with extremely weak digestion, and unable to take 
milk. 




TO STERILIZE MILK 

As soon as received, heat to nearly the boiling-point; then 
remove from the fire, and cool as quickly as possible, by 
pouring it into clean pans, previously scalded, and placing 
these in cold water. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Set a pan containing a quart or more of thick, sour milk 
in a pan of hot w^ater, or on the back of the stove; as soon as 
the whey separates from the curd, line a colander with a cloth, 
pour in the scalded milk, tie the corners of the cloth together, 
and hang up till well drained; put into a bowl, add one-fourth 
teaspoonful of salt, and enough sweet cream to make as moist 
as desired; mix smooth with a spoon, turn lightly into a dish, 
and serve. 

HOMINY OR HULLED CORN 

To hull four quarts of corn, use one heaping tablespoonful 
of soda, and water enough to cover the corn. Boil for four 
hours, or until the hull is well loosened and can be readily 
removed. Then wash in cold water thoroughly, stirring, rub- 
bing, and rinsing until the hulls have all been turned off. Soak 
in clear water overnight to remove all traces of soda, and cook 
in a kettle or large saucepan all day in clear water, stirring 
occasionally to prevent burning on the bottom, and replenish- 
ing with hot water as needed. Season with salt, put into a 
jar, and keep in a cool place. 

DRIED SWEET CORN 

Remove the husks and silks, boil and cut from the cob as 
directed for stewed sweet corn on page 57. Spread thinly on 
a cloth or on shallow tins, and place in the sun to dry. Turn 
over occasionally, take in in the evening, and put out to dry 
every day until thoroughly hard and dry. To keep ofif flies 
and insects, cover with mosquito webbing. Corn may also be 
dried in a warm, open oven, if careful not to allow the oven 
to get too hot. When dry, soak and cook the same as stewed 
sweet corn, only longer; or with beans soaked overnight. 

DRIED APPLES 

Take good, ripe apples, pare, quarter, core, and cut into thin 



A friend in the Kitchen 103 

slices; spread on shallow tins, and place in the oven until well 
heated through, then in the sun or in a moderate, open oven 
until thoroughly dried. Turn the fruit over occasionally each 
day while drying. Wire screens or webbings are serviceable 
in keeping off the flies. Other fruits may be dried in a similar 
manner. 

POP-CORN 

Shell, and place a handful in a wire popper or frying-pan, 
covering tightly; shake constantly over a hot fire, being careful 
not to burn. When the popping ceases, it is done; add a little 
salt and butter; mix with it a little thick sugar sirup, or mo- 
lasses boiled down, and press it into balls with the hands 
slightly oiled. 

TO KEEP APPLES, ORANGES, AND LEMONS 

Wrap each separately in tissue paper, and lay so as not to 
touch each other, in a cool, dry place. 

TO KEEP EGGS 

To twelve quarts of water add two pints of fresh, slaked 
lime and one pint of common salt; mix well, immerse newly- 
laid eggs, and set in a cool place. Or, dip the eggs into a 
solution of gum arabic — equal parts gum and water — let dry, 
then dip again. When dry, wrap separately in paper, and pack 
in sawdust, bran, or salt. 

TO PRESERVE LEMON-JUICE 

When lemons are cheap, purchase several dozen at once. 
With the hand press each lemon on the table, rolling it back 
and forth briskly a few times; cut into halves, and extract the 
juice with a lemon drill into a bowl or tumbler, — never into 
a tin; strain the juice through a wire strainer, colander, or 
coarse cloth to remove the seeds and pulp; add a pint of water 
and a pound of white sugar to the juice of each dozen lemons, 
and boil in an enameled saucepan for about ten minutes; then 
bottle and set in a cool place, and it is ready for use. A table- 
spoonful or two of the sirup in a glass of water makes a cool- 
ing, healthful drink. 

COOKED PINEAPPLE 

Pare with a sharp knife, cut into thin slices, divide the 
slices into quarters, put into a saucepan with one-half cup of 
water, and a very little sugar for each pineapple; cover with 
a china plate or enameled lid, and cook slowly for about two 
hours. 

TO FROST FRUITS 

Secure nice bunches of cherries, currants, grapes, or berries 
with the stems on; dip them into the stiffly beaten white of 



104 A Friend in the Kitchen 

an egg, then into powdered sugar, and place on a plate or 
clean white paper so as not to touch each other, to dry. Then 
place the fruit on a glass dish, chill, and serve. 

UNLEAVENED BREAD FOR SACRAMENTAL USE 

Take three cups of white flour, half a cup of thick sweet 
cream, a pinch of salt, and a little cold water. Sift the flour 
into a dish, add the salt and cream, and rub together 
thoroughly; then moisten with cold water till of the consist- 
ency of thick pie crust. Knead and roll well with the hand 
for fifteeri minutes; then roll out to about a quarter of an 
inch in thickness, and cut into cakes four inches square. Mark 
out each cake into half-inch squares with a knife, so that when 
baked it may easily be broken, and prick each square with a 
fork to prevent blistering. Lay on floured baking tins, and 
bake in a quick oven, being careful not to scorch or burn. 

UNFERMENTED WINE FOR SACRAMENTAL USE 

Secure good grapes, the small, dark wine grape is prefer- 
able, and proceed as with grape juice on page 46. 

TO CUT LEMONS FOR GARNISHING 

Divide slices of lemons into four parts, and use on salads 
and other dishes, placing the points toward the center. 

HOW TO CUT BREAD 

Bread should be cut into smooth, even slices, not too thick, 

^'— ^"^ '*b'6n8^'^?»s5s=i^as?5s&i4 loaf. If large, the slices maiy be 

Bread Kmfe divided. The Clauss, or scal- 

loped-edged, bread-knife does the work nicely. If bread or 

cake is to be cut while warm, the knife should first be heated. 

NUT RELISH 

Take one cup of almond or peanut butter, one cup of dried 
figs, or seedless raisins, and one cup of gluten. Mix well 
together, then grind twice through a nut mill. Mold into a 
square pan, then cut into inch squares one-half inch thick, 
similar in size to caramels. 

NUT DAINTIES 

Crack English walnuts so as not to break the meats. Take 
the two halves from each nut and press on each side of a nut 
relish square. When sufficient are prepared, place in a dish 
with an equal number of olives.

Note. — The above is simply suggestive, and may be simplified, enlarged, 
or varied as desired. It is not supposed that every person shall necessarily 
eat everything indicated for each meal. Some will prefer the grain and 
vegetable dishes; others the grain and fruit. If a third meal is eaten, 
either at middle or close of day, it should be light and simple, — a mere lunch. 




SABBATH DINNERS 

The Sabbath is the day of rest. In order that it may be 
devoted by all to religious exercises, holy meditation, and 
spiritual delight, it should be as free as possible from the 
ordinary duties and cares of life. To make it thus, preparation 
on the day before is necessary. The Lord calls the day before 
the Sabbath "the preparation" day. Luke 23:54. Of the work 
to be done on this day he says : " To-morrow is the rest of the 
holy Sabbath unto the Lord : bake that which ye will bake 
to-day, and seethe [boil] that ye will seethe; and that which 
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning." 
Ex. 16 : 23. 

The Sabbath should not be made a day of feasting. The 
labor of the week being laid aside, a moderate amount of plain, 
wholesome food is all that is necessary. To gormandize on 
this day, as is the custom with many, causes the mind to be- 
come dull and stupid, and unfits it for spiritual devotion. 

With proper planning, very little, if any, cooking need ever 
be done on the Sabbath, aside from simply warming over 
some of the foods prepared the previous day. 

Brown bread, fruit bread-sticks, or French rolls; warmed 
up potatoes, or potatoes with cream; baked or boiled beans; 
split pea or lentil soup, with croutons; sago, tapioca, or some 
other simple pudding or pie; canned or stewed fruit; and fresh 
fruits and nuts, make an excellent Sabbath dinner. All these 
may be prepared on the previous day. The potatoes may be 
boiled ready to warm up, the beans baked or boiled, the peas 
or lentils cooked and rubbed through a colander ready to add 
the seasoning and necessary water for soup, the croutons pre- 
pared, the fruit stewed, the pudding or pie baked, and the nuts 
cracked. Then the dinner may be made ready quickly, and 
with but little effort.

FOOD COMBINATIONS 

Because of their chemical nature, the time required to digest 
them, and the place where, and the juices with which, they are 
digested, some foods do not combine as well as others. While 
the young and those with sound stomachs and vigorous diges- 
tion may experience little or no inconvenience from improper 
and more varied combinations, to continue their use is likely 
in time seriously to impair the digestion. Dyspeptics and 
those troubled with slow digestion will find it to their ad- 
vantage to avoid such combinations as fruits and vegetables, 
milk and vegetables, sugar and milk, milk and fruits; and, when 
fruits are taken, to eat then; at the close of the meal. The 
following are good combinations: Grains and fruits; fruits and 
nuts; grains, fruits, and nuts; grains, legumes, and vegetables; 
grains and milk. An excellent rule to follow is to avoid a large 
variety at any meal, and let natural cravings indicate largely the 
kinds of food eaten. Above all, use common sense, and relish 
what you eat.

NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FOODS 

The nutritive food elements are classified into three groups. 
The nitrogenous, or muscle- and tissue-building; the carbona- 
ceous, or heat- and energy-producing; and the mineral, or the 
bone- and nerve-building. 

Albumen, gluten, and casein belong to the nitrogenous; 
starch, sugar, and fats to the carbonaceous; and salts, cellulose 
portions, and inorganic substances to the mineral. 

The nitrogenous elements are of prime importance, as they 
nourish the brain, nerves, muscles, and the more highly vital- 
ized tissues of the body. The carbonaceous, however, are re- 
quired in much larger quantities, the correct proportion being 
about eight or ten of carbonaceous to one of nitrogenous.

HOW TO BECOME A VEGETARIAN 

The fact that many people abstain from flesh food alto- 
gether, and maintain their full vigor, is good proof that the 
eating of flesh-meat is not essential to either life or health. 
But those accustomed all their life to the use of meat may 
need to use a little caution in making a change to a vege- 
tarian diet. A good way to begin might be to limit one's self 
at first to the use of meat once or twice a week, discarding 
it as better foods are substituted. The British Vegetarian 
Society, in " How to Begin," gives the following sugges- 
tions for those desiring to make this change : — 

1. Steadily persevere. 

2. Use Variety. — Nature afifords the most bountiful abundance. 
Have something new on your table frequently, especially fruits. 

3. Choose foods which compel mastication. 

4. Drink Little. — If fruits be used plentifully — condiments, 
hot foods, and stimulants avoided, and frequently bathing prac- 
tised — little drink will be required. 

5. Prefer natural to manufactured foods. 

6. Avoid Excess. — Most people eat too much ; a smaller quan- 
tity of food, well masticated, will nourish and sustain the sys- 
tem best. 

7. Eat Seldom. — Not more than thrice daily. " Little and 
often " is an unwise maxim for any healthy person. And if you 
wish sound sleep, and an appetite for breakfast, avoid suppers. 

8. Let your food he attractively prepared. 

g. See That Your Life he Right in Other Respects. — Eat food 
which is pure of its kind, agreeably prepared, at right times, 
and in right quantities; breathe pure air by night and by day; 
take physical exercise (if possible in the open air) daily; and 
practise strict cleanliness. 

10. Get Mind and Body in Harmony. — Remember that man's 
physical condition, and the state of his spi itual and mental 
faculties are closely and mutually inter-dependent. It is, there- 
fore, a primary essential to keep these also in health; and to 
see that they be usefully, tranquilly, and constantly occupied 
and cultivated. 

VEGETARIANISM IN LONDON 

Vegetarianism has worked an improvement, and its many 
restaurants in London show how the taste for this diet has 
been on the increase of late. One very great and undeniable 
advantage in the teaching of this school is the showing us 
how many foods we possess, and how few, comparatively 



no A Friend in the Kitchen 

speaking, we have used. Also, it proves to us how much 
cheaper we could live by utilizing all the foods at our com- 
mand except meat, and abstaining from it. — Mrs. Beeton. 

RULES FOR DYSPEPTICS 

Dyspepsia, or indigestion, is coming to be so general 
as to demand serious attention. The following rules will be 
found valuable to those suffering with this complaint : — 

1. Eat slowly, chewing the food very thoroughly, even 
more so, if possible, than is required in health. The more time 
the food spends in the mouth, the less it will need to spend 
in the stomach. 

2. Avoid drinking at meals; at most, take a few sips of 
warm drink at the close of the meal, if the food is very dry. 

3. In general, dyspeptic stomachs manage dry food better 
than that containing much fluid. 

4. Eat neither very hot nor very cold food. The best 
temperature is about that of the body. Avoid exposure to cold 
after eating. 

5. Be careful to avoid excess in eating. Eat no more than 
the wants of the system require. Sometimes less than is really 
needed must be taken when the digestion is very weak. 
Strength depends not on what is eaten, but on what is digested. 

6. Never take violent exercise, 'either mental or physical, 
just before or just after a meal. Do not go to sleep immedi- 
ately after eating. 

7. Do not eat more than three times a day, and make the 
last meal very light. For many dyspeptics two meals are 
better than more. 

8. Avoid eating two meals too close together, as this is 
one of the most prolific causes of indigestion. 

9. Observe regularity in eating; do not eat between meals. 
ID. Never eat when very tired, whether exhausted from men- 
tal or physical labor. Rest first. 

11. Never eat when the mind is worried, or the temper is 
ruffled, if possible to avoid doing so. 

12. Eat only food that is easy of digestion, avoiding com- 
plicated and indigestible dishes, and taking from but one to 
three kinds at a meal. 

13. Omit a meal occasionally, or fast a day. This will give 
the stomach time to rest and recuperate, and will be found 
beneficial. 

14. If the stomach or bowels feel weak or tender, apply hot 
fomentations over them. 

15. Most persons will be benefited by the use of oatmeal,

Graham flour, cracked wheat, whole wheat flour, and other 
whole-grain preparations, though many will find it necessary 
to avoid vegetables, especially when fruits are taken.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 



Every housewife should take pride in keeping her home neat 
and tidy. " Order is heaven's first law." 

Sinks and drains should be frequently cleaned and disin- 
fected. 

Dish-cloths should always be washed out after using; other- 
wise they are liable to become foul and full of germs. 

After washing the dishes, pour over them scalding water, 
and wipe quickly with a clean dry cloth. This insures clean- 
liness, and gives a nice polish. 

Scour steel knives after each meal. 

Sweep out the corners, and under the tables and chairs as 
well as the middle of the room. " Dirt may be hated, but should 
never be hidden." 

Pare vegetables and fruits thin; study how to use left-over 
foods; save the bread crumbs for puddings and scalloped vege- 
tables. " Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be 
lost."
