to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

PREFACE. 



Thb Receipts composing the Volume here submitted 
to the Public have been collected unde» peculiarly 
favourable circumstances by a Lady of distinction, 
whose productions in the lighter department of litera- 
ture entitle her to a place among the most successful 
writers of the present day. Moving in the first cir- 
cles of rank and fashion^ her associations have qualified 
her to furnish directions adapted to the manners and 
taste of the most refined Luxury; whilst long and 
attentive observation^ and the communications of an 
extensive acquaintance^ have enabled her equally to 
accommodate them to the use of persons of less ample 
means and of simpler and more economical habits. 

When the task of arranging the mass of materials 
thus accumulated devolved upon the Editor, it became 



IV PREFACE. 

his study to give to them such a form as should be 
most convenient for constant reference. A glance at 
the *^ Contents," which might with equal propriety be 
denominated an Index, wiU, he flatters himself, con- 
vince the reader that this object has been accomplished. 
It will there be seen that the Receipts, upwards of Six- 
teen Hundred in number, are classed under Eleven 
distinct Heads, each of which is arranged in alphabetical 
order — a method which confers on this Volume a de- 
cided advantage over every other work of the kind, 
inasmuch as it affords all the facilities of a Dictionary, 
without being liable to the unpleasant intermixture of 
heterogeneous matters which cannot be avoided in that 
form of arrangement. 

The intimate connexion between the Science of 
Cookery and the Science of Health, the sympathies 
subsisting between every part of the system and the 
stomach, and the absolute necessity of strict attention 
not less to the manner of preparing the alimentary sub- 
stances offered to that organ than to their quality and 
quantity, have been of late years so repeatedly and so 
forcibly urged by professional pens, that there needs no 
argument here to prove the utility of a safe Guide and 
Director in so important a department of domestic 



PREFACE. V 

economy as that which is the subject of this Volume. 
In many more cases^ indeed^ than the uninitiated ^would 
imagine^ is the healthy tone of the stomach dependent 
on the proper preparation of the food^ the healthy tone 
of the body in general on that of the stomach, and the 
healthy tone of the mind on that of the body : conse- 
quently the first of these conditions ought to command 
the vigilance and solicitude of all who are desirous of 
securing the true enjoyment of life — the mens sana 
in corpore sano. 

The professed Cook may perhaps be disposed to form 
a mean estimate of these pages, because few, or no 
learned^ or technical, terms are employed in them; 
but this circumstance, so far from operating to the 
disparagement of the work, must prove a strong re- 
commendation to the Public in general. The chief 
aim, in fact, of the noble Authoress has been to furnish 
such plain directions, in every branch of the culinary 
art, as shall be really useful to English masters and 
English servants, and to the humble but earnest prac- 
titioner. Let those who may desire to put this collec- 
tion of receipts to the test only give them a fair trial, 
neither trusting to conceited servants, who, despising 
all other methods, obstinately adhere to their own, and 

a2

then lay the blame of failure upon the directions ; nor 
committing their execution to careless ones, who neglect 
the means prescribed for success, either in regard to 
time, quantities, or cleanliness 5 and the result will not 
fail to afford satisfactory evidence of their pleasant 
qualities and practical utility.

THE 



LADY^S OWN COOKERY BOOK. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

The following directions may appear trite and common, but 
it is of the greatest consequence that they be strictly observed: 

Attend to minute cleanliness. Never wipe a dish, bowl, or 
pan, with a half dirty napkin, or give the vessel a mere rinse 
in water and think that it is then fit for use. See that it be 
dried and pure from all smell before you put in any ingredient. 

Never use the hands when it is possible to avoid it ; and, 
when you do, have a clean basin of water to dip them in, and 
wipe them thoroughly several times while at work, as in mix- 
ing dough, &c. 

Use silver or wooden spoons ; the latter are best for all 
confectionery and puddings. Take care that the various spoons, 
skewers, and knives, be not used promiscuously for cookery 
and confectionery, or even for different dishes of the same sort. 

If an onion is cut with any knife, or lies near any article of 
kitchen use, that article is not fit for service till it has been 
duly scoured and laid in the open air. The same remark 
applies to very many strong kitchen herbs. This point is 
scarcely ever enough attended to. 

In measuring quantities, be extremely exact, having always 
some particular vessel set apart for each ingredient (best of 
earthenware, because such cannot retain any smell) where- 
with to ascertain your quantities. Do nothing by guess, how 
practised soever you may deem yourself in the art : nor 
say ** Oh! I want none of your measures for such a thing as a 
little seasoning," taking a pinch here and there. Be assured 
you will never in that way make a dish, or a sauce, twice 
in the same manner; it may be good by chance, but it yriR 
always be a chance, and the chances are very much against 
it ; at all events it will not be precisely the same thing, and 
precision is the very essence of good cookery.

4 GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

The French say II faut que rien ne domine — No one 
ingredient must predominate. This is a good rule to please 
general taste and great judges ; but, to secure the favour of 
a particular palate it is not infallible: as, in a good herb soup, 
for instance, it may better delight the master or mistress that 
some one herb or savoury meat should predominate. Consult, 
therefore, the peculiarities of the tastes of your employer ; for, 
though a dish may be a good dish of its kind, if it is not 
suited to the taste of the eater of what avail is it ? 

Let not the vanity of the cook induce you to forget the duty 
of a servant, which is, in the first place, to please his master : 
be particular, therefore, in enquiring what things please your 
employer. Many capital cooks will be found for great feasts 
and festivals, but very few for every-day service, because this 
is not " eye-service,*' but the service of principle and duty. 
Few, indeed, there are who will take equal pains to make one 
delicate dish, one small exquisite dinner, for the three hundred 
and sixty-five days in the year ; yet this is by far the most * 
valuable attainment of the two. 

The great secret of all cookery consists in making fine meat 
jellies ; this is done at less expence than may be imagined by 
a careful, honest cook. For this purpose let all parings of 
meats of every kind, all bones, however dry they may appear, 
be carefully collected, and put over a very slow fire in a small 
quantity of water, always adding a little more as the water 
boils down. Skim this juice when cool : and, having melted 
it a second time, pass it through a sieve till thoroughly pure : 
put no salt or pepper; use this fine jelly for any sauce, adding 
herbs, or whatever savoury condiments you think proper, at the 
time it is used. 

Be careful all summer long to dry vegetables and herbs. 
Almost every herb and vegetable may be dried and preserved 
for winter use ; for on these must chiefly depend all the varied 
flavours of your dishes. Mushrooms and artichokes strung 
on a string, with a bit of wood knotted in between each to 
prevent their touching, and hung in a dry place, will be ex- 
cellent ; and every species of culinary herb may be preserved 
either in bottles or paper bags.

GENERAL RULES FOR A GOOD DINNER. 



Tbbbb should be always two soups» white and brown, two 
fish, dressed and undressed ; abouilli and petits-pat^s ; and on 
the sideboard a plain roast joint, besides many savoury articles, 
such as hung beef, Bologna sausages, pickles, cold ham, cold 
pie, &c. some or all of these according to the number of guests, 
the names of which the head-servant ought to whisper about 
to the company, occasionally offering them. He should like- 
wise carry about all the side-dishes or entries, after the soups 
are taken away in rotation. A silver lamp should be kept 
burning, to put any dish upon that may grow cold. 

It is indispensable to have candles, or plateau, or epergne, in 
the middle of the table. 

Beware of letting the table appear loaded ; neither should it 
be too bare. The soups and fish should be dispatched before 
the rest of the dinner is set on ; but, lest any of the guests eat 
of neither, two small dishes of pat6s should be on the table. 
Of course, the meats and vegetables and fruits which compose 
these dinners must be varied according to the season, the num- 
ber of guests, and the tastes of the host and hostess. It is 
also needless to add that without iced champagne and Roman 
punch a dinner is not called a dinner. 

These observations and the following directions for dinners 
are suitable to persons who chuse to live fashionably } but the 
receipts contained in this book will suit any mode of living, 
and the persons consulting it will find matter for all tastes and 
all establishments. There is many an excellent dish not con- 
sidered adapted to a fashionable table, which, nevertheless, is 
given in these pages.

Almond Soup. 
Takb lean beef or veal, about eight or nine pounds, and a 
scrag of mutton ; boil them gently in water that will cover 
them, till the gravy be very strong and the meat very tender; 
then strain off the gravy and set it on the fire with two ounces 
of vermicelli, eight blades of mace, twelve cloves, to a gallon. 
Let it boil till it has the flavour of the spices. Have ready one 
pound of the best almonds, blanched and pounded very fine ; 
pound them with the yolks of twelve eggs, boiled hard, mixing 
as you pound them with a little of the soup, lest the almonds 
should grow oily. Pound them till they are a mere pulp : 
add a little soup by degrees to the almonds and eggs until 
mixed together. Let the soup be cool when you mix it, and do

hours, adding more water to them if necessary. When quite 
done, pound them in a mortar, and then rub them through a 
sieve with the liquor in which they have been boiling. Add 
a quart of the mixed jelly soup, boil it all together, and leave 
it on a corner of the fire till served. It must be thick and 
smooth as melted butter, and care taken throughout that it 
does not bum. 

Pea Soup, No. 2. 

Take about three or four pounds of lean beef; cut it in pieces 
and set it on the fire in three gallons of water, with nearly one 
pound of ham, a small bundle of sweet herbs, another of mint, 
and forty peppercorns. Wash a bunch of celery clean, put in 
the green tops ; then add a quart of split peas. Cover it close, 
and let the whole boil gently till two parts out of three are 
wasted. Strain it off, and work it through a colander ; put it 
into a clean saucepan with five or six heads of celery, washed 
and cut very small ; cover it close, and let it stew till reduced 
to about three quarts : then cut some fat and lean bacon in 
dice, fry them just crisp ; do the same by some bread, and put 
both into the soup. Season it with salt to your taste. When 
it is in the terrine, rub a little dried mint over it. If you 
diuse it, boil an ox's palate tender, cut it in dice, and put in, 
also forcemeat balls. 

Pea Soup. No. 3. 

To a quart of split peas put three quarts of water, two good 
turnips, one large head of celery, four onions, one blade of 
ginger, one spoonful of flour of mustard, and a small quantity 
of cayenne, black pepper, and salt. Let it boil over a slow 
fire till it is reduced to two quarts ; then work it through a 
colander with a wooden spoon. Set it on the fire, and let it 
boil up ; add a quarter of a pound of butter mixed with flour ; 
beat up the yolks of three eggs, and stir it well in the soup. 
Cut a slice of 4)read into small dice ; fry them of a light 
brown ; put them into your soup-dish, and pour the soup over 
them. 

Pea Soup. No. 4. 

Boil one onion and one quart of peas in three quarts of 
water till they are soft ; then work them through a hair sieve. 
Mix the pulp with the water in which the peas were boiled ; 
set it over the fire and let it boil ; add two cabbage lettuces, 
cut in slices, half a pint of young peas, and a little salt. Let

it boil quickly half an hour ; mix a little batter and flour, and 
boil in the soup. 

Portable Soup. 

Strip all the skin and fat off a leg of veal ; then cut all the 
fleshy parts from the bone, and add a shin of beef, which treat 
in the same way ; boil it slowly in three gallons of water or more 
according to the quantity of the meat ; let the pot be closely 
covered : when you find it, in a spoon, very strong and clanuny, 
like a rich jelly, take it off and strain it through a hair sieve 
into an earthen pan. After it is thoroughly cold, take off any fat 
that may remain, and divide your jelly clear of the bottom into 
small flattish cakes in chinaware cups covered. Then place 
these cups in a large deep stewpan of boiling water over a 
stove fire, where let it boil gently till the jelly becomes a per- 
fect glue; but take care the water does not get into the cups, 
for that will spoil it all. These cups of glue must be taken 
out, and, when cold, turn out the glue into a piece of new 
coarse flannel, and in about six hours turn it upon more fresh 
flannel, and keep doing this till it is perfectly dry ^ if you 
then lay it by in a dry warm place, it will presently become 
like a dry piece of glue. When you use it in travelling, take a 
piece the size of a large walnut, seasoning it with fre^ herbs, 
and if you can have an old fowl, or a very little bit of fresh 
meat, it will be excellent. 

Potato Soup. 

Rve large carrots, two turnips, three large mealy potatoes, 
seven onions, three beads of celery ; slice them all thin, with 
a handful of sweet herbs ; put them into one gallon of water, 
with bones of beef, or a piece of mutton ; let them simmer 
gently till the vegetables will pulp through a sieve. Add 
cayenne pepper, salt, a pint of milk> or half a pint of cream, 
with a small piece of butter beaten up with flour. 

Rabbit Soup. 

One large rabbit, one pound of lean ham, one onion, one 
turnip, and some celery, two quarts of water ; let them boil till 
the rabbit is tender. Strain off the liquor ; boil a pint of 
cream, and add it to the best part of the rabbit pounded ; if not 
of the thickness you wish, add some flour and butter, and rub 
it through a sieve. It must not be boiled after the cream is 
added. 

Root Soup. 

Potatoes, French turnips, English turnips, carrots, celery, . 
of each six roots; pare and wash them; add three or four 
onions ; set them on the fire with the bones of a rump of beef. 



SOUPS. 47 

or, if you have no such thing, about two pounds of beef, or 
any other beef bones. Chop them up, and put them on. the 
fire with water enough to cover them ; let them stew very 
gently till the roots are all tender enough to rub through a 
sieve. This done, cut a few roots of celery small, and put it 
to the strained soup. Season it with pepper and salt, and stew 
it gently till the celery is tender ; then serve it with toast or 
fried btead. A bundle of herbs may be boiled in it, just to 
flavour it, and then taken out. 

Scotch Leek Soup. 

You make this soup to most advantage the day after a leg 
of mutton has been boiled, into the liquor from which put four 
large large leeks, cut in pieces. Season with pepper and salt, 
and let it boil gently for a quarter of an hour. Mi^: half a 
pint of oatmeal with cold water till quite smooth ; pour this 
into the soup ; let it simmer gently half an hour longer ; and 
serve it up. 

To brown or colour Soup, 

To brown soup, take two lumps of loaf-sugar in an iron 
spoon ; let it stand on the stove till it is quite black, and put 
it into soup. 

Seasoning for Soups and Brown Sauces, 

Salt a bullock's liver, pressing it thoroughly with a great 
weight for four days. Take ginger and every sort of spice 
that is used to meat, and half a pound of brown sugar, a good 
quantity of saltpetre, and a pound of juniper-berries. Rub 
the whole in thoroughly, and let it lie six weeks in the liquor, 
boiling and skimming every three days, for an hour or two, till 
the liver becomes as hard as a board. Then steep it in the smoke 
liquor that is used for hams, and afterwards hang it up to 
smoke for a considerable time. When used, cut slices as thin 
as a wafer, and stew them down with the jelly of which you 
make your sauce or soup, and it will give a delightful flavour. 

Soup, No. I. 

A quarter of a pound of portable soup, that is, one cake, in 
two quarts of boiling water ; vegetables to be stewed separately, 
^nd added after the soup is dissolved. 
Soup, No. 2. 

Take a piece of beef about a stone weight, and 9. knuckle of 
veal, eight or ten onions, a bunch of thyme and parsley, an 
ounce of allspice, ten cloves, some whole pepper and salt ; boil 
all these till the meat is all to pieces. Strain and take off the fat. 
Make about a quart of brown beef gravy with some of your 
broth ; then take half a pound of butter and a good handed of 



48 SOUPS. 

flour mixed together, put it into a stewpan, set it over a slow 
fire, keeping it stirring till very brown ; have ready what herbs 
you design for your soup, either endive or celery ; chop them, 
but not too small ; if you wish for a fine soup add a palate and 
sweetbreads, the palate boiled tender, and the sweetbreads 
fried, and both cut into small pieces. Put these, with herbs, 
into brown butter ; put in as much of your broth as you intend 
for your soup, which must be according to the size of your dish. 
Give them a boil or two, then put in a quart of your gravy, and 
put all in a pot, with a fowl, or what you intend to put in your 
dish. Cover it close, and, let it boil an hour or more on a slow 
fire. Should it not be seasoned enough, add more salt, or 
what you think may be necessary : a fowl, or partridge, or 
squab pigeons, are best boiled in soup and .to lie in the dish 
with it. 

Soup. No. 3. 

Cut three pounds of beef and one pound of veal in slices and 
beat it. Put half a pound of butter and a piece of bacon in 
your pan, brown it, and sprinkle in half a spoonful of flour. Cut 
two onions in ; add pepper and salt, a bit of mace, and some 
herbs, then put in your meat, and fry it till it is brown on both 
sides. Have in readiness four quarts of boiling water, and a 
saucepan that will hold both water and what is in your frying- 
pan. Cover it close ; set it over a slow fire and stew it down, 
till it is wasted to about five pints ; then strain it off, and add 
to it what soup-herbs you like, according to your palate. 
Celery and endive must be first stewed in butter ; and peas and 
asparagus first boiled, and well drained from the butter, be- 
fore you put it to the soup. Stew it some time longer, and 
skim off aU the fat ; then take a French roll, which put in your 
soup-dish ; pour in your soup, and serve it up. Just before you 
take it off the fire, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. 

If veal alone is used, and fowl or chicken boiled in it and 
taken out when enough done, and the liquor strained, and the 
fowl or chicken put to the clear liquor, with vermicelli, you 
will have a fine white soup ; and the addition of the juice of a 
lemon is a great improvement. 

The French cooks put in chervil and French turnips, lettuce, 
sorrel, parsley, beets, a little bit of carrot, a little of parsnips, 
this last must not boil too long — all to be strained off: to 
be sent up with celery, endive (or peas) or asparagus, and 
stuffed cucumbers. 

Soup without Meat, 

Take two quarts of water, a little pepper, salt, and Jamaica 
pepper, a blade of mace, ten or twelve cloves, three or four 
onions, a crust of bread, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; boil all 



SOUPS. 49 

these well. Take the white of two or three heads of endive, 
chopped, but not too smdl. Put three quarters of a pound of 
butter in a stewpan that will be large enough to hold all your 
liquor. Set it on a quick fire till it becomes very brown ; then 
put a little of your liquor to prevent its turning, or oiling ; 
shake in as much flour as will make it rather thick ; then put 
in the endive and an onion shred small, stirring it well. 
Strain all your liquor, and put it to the butter and herbs ; let 
it stew over a slow fire almost an hour. Dry a French roU, 
and let it remain in it till it is soaked through, and lay it in 
your dish with the soup. You may make this soup with aspa- 
ragus, celery, or green peas, but they must be boiled before 
you put them to the burnt butter. 

Soup for the Poor. 

E^ght pails of water, two quarts of barley, four quarts of 
split peas, one bushel of potatoes, half a bushel of turnips, half 
a bushel of carrots, half a peck of onions, one ounce of pepp^, 
two pounds of salt, an ox's head, parsley, herbs, boiled six 
hours, produce one hundred and thirty pints. Boil the meat 
and take off the first scum before the other ingredients are put 
in.

ter ; put them in a pot with liquor, carrots, turnips, thyme, 
parsley, and onions. Boil and scum it; then season with a 
head or two of celery ; boil this down ; take half a pound of 
blanched almonds, and beat them ; take two fowls, half roast- 
ed^ two sweetbreads set off; beat these in a mortar, put them

leaving the breast whole, and stew in consomm^. When the 
breast is tender, take it out, (leaving the other parts to stew 
with the consomm^) pound it well with the almonds and three 
hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and take it out of the mortar. 
Strain the consomm^, and put it, when the fat is skinmied off, to 
the abnonds, &c. Have about a quarter of a pint of Scotch 
barley boiled very tender, add it to the other ingredients, put 
them into a pot with the consomm^, and stir it over the fire 
till it is boiling hot and well mixed. Rub it through a tamis, 
and season it with a little salt ; it must not boil after being 
rubbed through.

Soupe Santd, or Wholesome Soup, 
Take beef and veal cut in thin slices ; put sliced tunu'ps, 
carrots, onions, bacon, in the bottom of your stewpan; lay 
your meat upon these, and over it some thin thyme, parsley, a 
head or two of celery. Cover the whole down ; set it over a 
charcoal fire ; draw it down till it sticks to the bottom ; then 
fill up with the above stock. Let it boil slowly till the good- 
ness is extracted from your meat ; then strain it off. Cut and 
wash some celery, endive, sorrel, a little chervil, spinach, and 
a piece of leek ; put these in a stewpan, with a bit of butter. 
Stew till tender, then put this in your soup ; give it a boil up 
together, and skim the fat off. Cut off the crust of French 
rolls ; dry and soak them in some of your soup ; put them into 
it, and serve your soup.

Observe to keep it often stirred after the rice is in, till served 
up. It will be ready an hour and a half after the saffron is in. 
You should put a fowl into it an hour before it is ready, and 
serve it up whole in the soup. 

This soup will keep two or three days. 

Turnip Soup, 

Make a good strong gravy of beef or mutton ; let it stand 
till cold ; take off all the fat ; pare some turnips and slice them 
thin ; stew them till tender, then strain them through a sieve ; 
mix the pulp with the gravy, till of a proper thickness : — then 
add three quarters of a pint of cream ; boil it up, and send it 
to table. 

Veal Soup* 

Take a knuckle of veal, and chop it into small pieces ; set it 
on the fire with four quarts of water, pepper, mace, a few herbs, 
and one large onion. Stew it five or six hours ; then strain off 
the spice, and put in a pint of green peas until tender. Take 
out the small bones, and send the rest up with the soup. 

Vegetable Soup. No. 1. 

Take a quart of beef jelly and the same quantity of veal 
jelly : boil it, have some carrots and turnips, cut small, previ- 
ously boiled in a little of the' jelly ; throw them in, and serve 
it up hot. 

Vegetable Soup. No. 2. 

Take two cabbage and two coss lettuces, one hard cabbage, 
six onions, one large carrot, two turnips, three heads of celery, 
a little tarragon, chervil, parsley, and thyme, chopped fine, and 
a little flour fried in a quarter of a pound of butter (or less 
will do). Then add three quarts of boiling water ; boil it for 
two hours, stir it well, and add, before sending it to table, some 
crumbs of stale bread : the upper part of the loaf is best. 

Vegetable Soup, No. 3. 
Let a quantity of dried peas (split peas), or haricots, (lentils) 
])e boiled in common water till they are quite tender ; let them 
then be gradually passed through a sieve with distilled water, 
working the mixture with a wooden spoon, to make what the 
French call apure : and let it be made sufficiently liquid with dis- 
tilled water to bear boiling down. Then let a good quantity of 
fresh vegetables, of any or aD kinds in their season, especially 
carrots, lettuces, turnips, celery, spinach, with always a few 
onions, be cut into fine shreds, and put it into common boiling 



SOUPS. 53 

water for three or four minutes to blanch ; let them then be taken 
out with a strainer, added to and mixed with the pur^, and the 
whole set to boil gently at the fire for at least two hours. A few 
minutes before taking the soup from the fire, let it be seasoned 
to the taste with pepper and salt. 

The soup, when boiling gently at the fire, should be very fre- 
quently stirred, to prevent its sticking to the side of the pan, 
and acquiring a burnt taste. 

Vegetable Soup, No. 4. 

Cut two potatoes, one turnip, two heads of celery, two 
onions, one carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs ; put them all 
into a stewpan ; cover close ; draw them gently for twenty 
minutes, then put two quarts of good broth, let it boil gently, 
and afterwards simmer for two hours. Strain through a fine 
sieve ; put it into your pan again ; season with pepper and salt, 
and let it boil up. 

Vegetable Soup, No. 5. 

Take four turnips, two potatoes, three onions, three heads 
of celery, two carrots, four cabbage lettuces, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and parsley. The vegetables must be cut in slices ; put 
them into a stewpan, with half a pint of water ; cover them 
close ; set them over the fire for twenty minutes to draw ; add 
three pints of broth or water, and let it boil quickly. When 
the vegetables are tender rub them through a sieve. If you 
make the soup with water, add butter, flour, pepper, and salt. 
Let it be of the thickness of good cream, and add some fine 
crumbs of bread with small dumplings. 

Vermicelli Soup, 
Break the vermicelli a little, throw it into boiling water, and 
let it boil about two minutes. Strain it in a sieve, and throw 
it into cold water : then strain and put it into a good clear 
consomm^, and let it boil very slowly about a quarter of an 
hour. When it is going to table, season with a little salt, and 
put into it a little crust of French roll. 

West India Soup, called Pepper Pot, 
A small knuckle of veal and a piece of beef of about three 
pounds, seven or eight pounds of meat in all.; potherbs as 
for any other soup. When the soup is skimmed and made, 
strain it off. The first ingredient you add to the soup must 
be some dried ocre (a West India vegetable), the quantity 
according to your judgment. It is hard and dry, and there- 



54 SOUPS. 

fore requires a great deal of soaking and boiling. ^Then put 
in the spawn of the lobsters you intend for your soup, first 
pounding it very fine, and mixing it by degrees with a little 
of your soup cooled, or it will be lumpy, and not so smooth as 
it should be. Put it into the soup-pot, and continue 'to stir 
some time after it is in. Take about two middhng handfuls 
of spinach and about six hearts of the inside of very nice 
greens ; scald both greens and spinach before you put them 
to the soup, to take off the rawness ; the greens require most 
scalding. Squeeze them quite dry, chop and put them into 
the soup ; then add all the fat and inside egg and spawn you 
can get from the lobsters, also the meat out of the tails and 
claws. Add the green tops only of a large bundle of aspara- 
gus, of the sort which they call sprew-grass, previously scalded ; 
a few green peas also are very good. After these ingredients 
are in, the soup should no more than simmer ; and when the 
herbs are sufficiently tender it is done enough. This soup is 
not to be clear, on the contrary thick with the lobster, and a 
perfect mash with the lobster and greens. You are to put in 
lobster to your liking ; I generally put in five or six, at least 
of that part of them which is called fat, egg, and inside spawn, 
sufficient to make it rich and good. It should look quite yel- 
low with this. Put plenty of the white part also, and in order 
that none of the goodness of the lobsters should be lost, take 
the shells of those which you have used, bruise them in a 
mortar, and boil them in some of the broth, to extract what 
goodness remains ; then strain off the liquor and add it to the 
rest. Scoop some potatoes round, half boiling them first, and 
put into it. Season with red pepper. Put in a piece of nice 
pickled pork, which must be first scalded, for fear of its being 
too salt ; stew it with the rest and serve it. 

White Soup, No. 1 . 
Take two chickens ; skin them ; take out the lungs and 
wash them thoroughly; put them in a stewpan with some 
parsley. Add a quart of veal jelly, and stew them in this for 
one hour over a very slow fire. Then take out the chickens, 
and put a penny roll to soak in the liquor ; take all the flesh 
of the chickens from the bones, and pound it in a mortar, with 
the yolk of three eggs boiled hard. Add the bread (when 
soaked enough) and pound it also with them ; then rub the 
whole finely through a sieve. Add a quart more jelly to the 
soup, and strain it through a sieve ; then put the chicken to 
the soup. Set a quart of cream on the fire till it boils, stir- 



SOUPS. 5o 

ring it all the time ,- when ready to serve, pour that into the 
soup and mix it well together. Have ready a little vermicelli, 
boiled in a little weak broth, to throw into the soup, when 
put into the terrine. 

White Soup. No. 2. 
Have good stock made of veal and beef; then take about a 
pound of veal, and the like quantity of ham, cut both into thin 
slices, and put them into a stewpan, with a pint of water and 
two onions cut small. Set it on the fire and stew it down 
gently, till it is quite dry, and of a rather light brown colour; 
then add the stock, and let it all stew till the veal and ham are 
quite tender. Strain it off into the stewpot ; add a gill or 
more of cream, some blanched rice boiled tender, the quantity 
to your own judgment, the yolks of six eggs beaten up well 
with a little new milk : let the soup be boiling hot before the 
eggs are added, which put to it by degrees, keeping it stirring 
over a slow fire. Serve it very hot : to prevent curdling, put the 
soup-pot into a large pot of boiling water, taking care that not 
the least drop of water gets in, and so make.it boiling hot. 

White Soup, No. 3. 
Cut one pound of veal, or half a fowl, into small pieces ; 
put to it a few sweet herbs, a crust of bread, an ounce of pearl 
barley well washed. Set it over a slow fire, closely covered ; 
let it boil till half is consumed ; then strain it and take off the 
fat. Have ready an ounce of sweet almonds blanched ; pound 
them in a marble mortar, adding a little soup to prevent their 
oiling. Mix all together. When you send it up, add one 
third of new milk or cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

White Soup. No. 4. 
Take a knuckle of veal, and put water according to the 
quantity of soup you require ; let it boil up and skim it ; then 
put in three oimces of lean bacon or ham, with two heads of 
celery, one carrot, one turnip, two onions, and three or four 
blades of mace, and boil for three or four hours. When pro- 
perly boiled, strain it off, taking care to skim off all the fat ; 
then put into it two ounces of rice, well boiled, half a pint of 
cream beaten up, and five or six yolks of eggs. When ready to 
serve, pour the soup to the eggs backward and forward to pre- 
vent it from curdling, and send it to table. You must boil the 
soup once after you add the cream, and before you put it to the 
eggs. Three laurel leaves put into it in summer and six in 
winter make a pleasant addition, instead of sweet almonds.

hard and finely bruised. Mix these all together in your soup ; 
let it just boil, and send it up hot. You may add a French 
roll ; let it be nicely browned. 

The ingredients here mentioned will make four quarts.

Stock from a boiled knuckle of veal, thickened with about 
two ounces of sweet almonds, beaten to a paste, with a spoonful 
of water to prevent their oiling ; a large slice of dressed veal,

half an hour, and stir in about a pint of cream without 
boiling. 



BROTHS. 



Broth for the Poor. 

A good wholesome broth may be made at a very reasonable 
rate to feed the poor in the country. The following quantities 
would furnish a good meal for upwards of fifty persons. 

Take twenty pounds of the very coarse pajrts of beef, five 
pounds of whole rice, thirteen gallons of water; boil the meat 
in the water first, and skim it very well ; then put in the rice, 
some turnips, carrots, leeks, celery, thyme, parsley, and a 
good quantity of potatoes ; add a good handful of salt, and 
boil them all togetiier till tender. 

Another, 
Four hundred quarts of good broth for the poor may be made 
as follows : — Good beef, fifty pounds weight ; beeves' cheeks, 
and legs of beef, five ; rice, thirty pounds ; peas, twenty-three 
quarts ; black pepper, five ounces and a half : cayenne pepper, 
half an ounce ; ground ginger, two ounces ; onions, thirteen 
pounds ; salt, seven pounds and a half; with celery, leeks, car- 
rots, dried mint, and any other vegetable. 

Broth for the Sick, No. 1. 
Boil one ounce of very lean veal, fifteen minutes in a little 
butter, and then add half a pint of water ; set it over a very 
slow fire, with a spoonful of barley and a piece of gum arabic 
about the size of a nut. 

Broth for the Sick. No. 2. 
Put a leg of beef and a scrag of mutton cut in pieces into 
three or four gallons of water, and let them boil twelve hours, 
occasionally stirring them well; and cover close. Strain the 
broth, and let it stand till it will form a jelly ; then take the fat 
from the top and the dross from the bottom.

5S BROtifs. 

Broth for the sick. No. 3. 

Take twelve quarts of water, two knuckles of veal, a leg of 
beef, or two shins, four calves* feet, a chicken, a rabbit, two 
onions, cloves, pepper, salt, a buncU of sweet herbs. Cover 
close, and let the whole boil till reduced to six quarts. Strain 
and keep it for use. 

Barley Broth, 

Take four or five pounds of the lean end of a neck of mutton, 
soak it well in cold water for some time, then put it in a sauce- 
pan with about four quarts of water and a tea-cupful of fine 
barley. Just before it boils take it off the fire and skim it ex- 
tremely well ; put in salt and pepper to your tastQ, and a small 
bundle of sweet herbs, which take out before the broth is sent up. 
Then let it boil very gently for some hours afterwards; add tur- 
nips, carrots, and onions, cut in small pieces, and continue to 
boil the broth till the vegetables are quite done and very tender. 
When nearly done it requires to be stirred frequently lest the 
barley should adhere. 

Another, 

Put on whatever bones you have ;' stew them down well with 
a little whole pepper, onions, and herbs. When done, strain 
it off, and next day take off all the fat. Take a little pearl 
barley, boil it a little and strain it off; put it to the broth, add 
a coss lettuce, carrot, and turnip, cut small. Boil all together 
some time, and serve it up. 

Chervil Broth for Cough, 
Boil a calf's liver and two large handfuls of chervil in four 
quarts of spring water till reduced to one quart. Strain it, and 
take a coffee-cupful night and morning. 

Hodge-Podge, 
Stew a scrag of mutton : put in a peck of peas, a bunch of 
turnips cut small, a few carrots, onions, lettuce, and some pars- 
ley. When sufficiently boiled add a few mutton chops, which 
must stew gently till done. 

Leek Porridge, 
Peel twelve leeks; boil them in water till tender; take them 
out and put them into a quart of new milk ; boil them well ; 
thicken up with oatmeal > and add salt according to the taste. 

Madame de Maillet*8 Broth. 
Two ounces of veal, six carrots, two turnips, one table-spoon- 
ful of gum arabic, one table-spoonful of rice, two quarts of 
water ; simmer for about two hours. 



BROTHS. 59 

Mutton Broth. 

The bone of a leg of mutton to be chopped small, and put 
into the stewpan with vegetables and herbs, together witb a 
little drop of water, and drawn as gravy soup ; add boiling 
water. 

Pork Broth. 

Take a leg of pork fresh cut up ; beat it and break the bone ; 
put it into ^ee gallons of soft water, with hs^lf an ounce of 
mace and the same quantity of nutmeg. Let it boil very gently 
over a slow fire, imtil two thirds of the water we consumed. 
Strain the broth through a fine sieve, and when it is cold take 
off the fat. Drink a large cupful in the morning fasting, and 
between meals, and just before going to bed, warmed. Season 
it with a little salt. This is a fine restorative, 

Potage. 
Boil a leg of beef, and a knuckle of veal, with a bunch of 
sweet herbs, a little mace and whole pepper, and a handful of 
salt. When the meat is boiled to rags or to a very strong 
broth, strain it through a hair sieve, and when it is cold, take 
off the fat. With raw beef make a gravy thus : cut your beef 
in pieces, put them in a frying-pan with a piece of butter or a 
slice of bacon, fry it very brown, then put it to some of your 
strong broth, and when it grows browner and thick till it becomes 
reduced to three pints of gravy, fill up your strong broth to 
boil with a piece of butter and a handful of sweet herbs. 
Afterwards a chicken must be boiled and blanched and cut in 
slices; and two or three sweetbreads fried very brown; a 
turnip also sliced and fried. Boil all these half an hour, and 
put them in the dish in which you intend to serve up, with 
three French rolls (cut in halves) and set it over a fire with a 
quart of your gravy, and some of your broth, covered with a 
dish, till it boils very fast, and as it reduces fill up with your 
broth till your bread is quite soaked. You may put into the 
dish either a duck, pigeon, or any bird you please ; but which- 
ever you choose, roast it first, and then let it boil in the dish 
with your bread. This may be made a pea soup, by only rub- 
bing peas through a sieve* 

Scotch Pottage, 
Place a tin saucepan on the fire with some boiling water ; 
stir in Scotch oatmeal till it is of the desired consistence: when 
done, pour it in a basin and add milk or cream to it. It is 
more nutritious to make it of milk instead of water, if the sto- 
mach wiU bear it. The Scotch peasantry live entirely on this

strengthening food. The hest Scotch oatmeal is to be bought 
at Dudgeon's, in the Strand. 

Scotch Broth. 
Boil very tender a piece of thin brisket of beef, with trim- 
mings of any other meat, or a piece of gravy beef ; cut it into 
square pieces ; strain off the broth and put it in a soup-pot ; 
add the beef, cut in squares, with plenty of carrots, turnips, 
celery, and onions, cut in shapes and well boiled before put to 
the broth, and, if liked, some very small suet dumplings first 
boiled. Season it to your palate. 

Turnip Broth. 
Have a sufficient quantity of good strong broth as for any 
other soup, taking care that it is not too strongly flavoured by 
any of the roots introduced into it. Peel a good quantity of 
the best turnips, selecting such as are not bitter. Sweat them 
in butter and a little water till they are quite tender. Rub 
them through a tamis, mix them with the broth ; boil it for 
about half 801 hour. Add half a pint of very good cream, and 
be careful not to have too fierce a fire, as it is apt to burn. 

Another, 

Put one pound of lean veal, pulled into small pieces in a 
pipkin, with two large or three middling turnips. Cover the 
pipkin very close, to prevent water from getting into it ; set it 
in a pot of water, and let it boil for two or three hours. A 
tea-cupful of the broth produced in the pipkin may be taken 
twice or thrice a day. 

Veal Broth. No. 1. 

Take ten or twelve knuckles, such as are cut off from legs 
and shoulders of mutton, at the very shank ; rub them with a 
little salt, put them in a pan of water for two or three hours, 
and wash them very clean ; boil them in a gallon of spring 
water for an hour. Strain them very clean, then put in two 
ounces of hartshorn shavings, and the bottom crust of a penny 
loaf ; let it boil till the water is reduced to about three pints ; 
strain it off, and when cold skim off the fat. Take half a pint 
warm before you rise, and the same in bed at night. Make it 
fresh three times a week in summer, and twice a week in 
winter : do not put in any lamb bones. This is an excellent 
thing. 

Veal Broth. No. 2. 

Soak a knuckle of veal for an hour in cold water ; put it into 
fresh water over the fire, and, as the scum rises, take it off; 



BROTHS. 61 

let it stew gently for two hours, with a little salt to make the 
scum rise. When it is sufficiently stewed, strain the broth from 
the meat. Put in some vermicelli ; keep the meat hot ; and 
as you are going to put the soup into the terrine add half a pint 
of cream. 

Veal Broth. No. 3. 
Take one pound of lean veal, one blade of mace, two table- 
spoonfuls of rice, one quart of water ; let it boil slowly two 
hours ; add a little salt. 

Veal Broth, No. 4. — Excellent for a Consumption, 
Boil a knuckle of veal in a gallon of water ; skim and put to 
it half a pound of raisins of the sun, stoned, and the bot- 
toms of two manchets, with a nutmeg and a half sliced, and a 
little hartshorn. Let it boil till reduced to half the quantity ; 
then pound it aD together and strain. Add some brown sugar- 
candy, some rose-water, and also the juice of a lemon, if the 
patient has no cough. 



FISH. 



Carp and Tench. 
Scale the fish, take out the gut and gall ; save all the blood 
Split the carp if large; cut it in large pieces, and salt it. 
Boil some sliced parsley roots and onions tender in half a pint 
of water, adding a little cayenne pepper, ginger, cloves, and 
allspice, a lemon sliced, a little vinegar, and moist sugar, one 
glass of red wine, and some butter rolled in flour. Then put 
in the fish, and let it boil very fast for half an hour in a stew- 
pan. The blood is to be put in the sauce. 

Carp, to stew. 
Scale, gut, and cleanse them ; save the roes and milts ; stew 
them in some good broth : season, to your taste, with a bundle 
of herbs, onions, anchovies, and white wine ; and, when they 
are stewed enough, thicken the sauce with the yolks of five 
eggs. Pass off the roes, dip them in yolk of ^^^ and flour, 
and fry them with some sippets of French bread ; then fry a 
little parsley, and, when you serve up, garnish the dish with 
the roes, parsley, and sippets. 

Another way. 
Have your carp fresh out of the water ; scale and gut them, 
washing the blood out of each fish with a little claret ; and 
save that after so doing. Cut your carp in pieces, and stew in a 
little fresh butter, a few blades of mace, winter savory, a little 
thyme, and three or four onions ; after stewing awhile, take 
them out, put them by, and fold them up in linen, till the liquor 
is ready to receive them again, as the fish would otherwise be 
boiled to pieces before the liquor was reduced to a proper 
thickness. When you have taken out your fish, put in the 
claret that you washed out the blood with, and a pint of beef 



64 FISH. 

or mutton gravy, according to the quantity of your fish, 
with some ssdt and the hutter in which you stewed the carp ; 
and when this butter is almost boiled to a proper thickness put 
in your fish again ; stew all together, and sen^e it up. Two 
spoonfuls of elder vinegar to the liquor when taken up will give 
a very agreeable taste. 

Cod, to stew. 
Cut a cod into thin pieces or slices; lay them in rows at 
the bottom of a dish ; put in a pint of white wine, half a pound 
of butter, a few oysters, with their liquor, a little pepper and 
salt, with some crumbs of bread. Stew them all till they are 
done enough. Garnish the dish with lemon. 

Cod, Ragout of. 
Wash the cod clean, and boil it in warm water, with vinegar, 
pepper, salt, a bay-leaf, and lemon. Make a sauce of burnt 
butter, fried flour, capers, and oysters. When you serve it up 
put in some black pepper and lemon-juice. 

Cod's Head, to boil. 

Take vinegar and salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and an onion ; 
set them on the fire in a kettle of water ; boil them and "put 
in the head ; and, while it is boiling, put in cold water and 
vinegar. When boiled, take it up, put it into a dish, and make 
sauce as follows : — Take gravy and claret, boiled with a bun- 
dle of sweet herbs and an onion, two or three anchovies, drawn 
with two pounds of butter, a pint of shrimps, oysters, the meat 
of a lobster shred fine. You may stick little toasts on the head, 
and lay on and about the roe, milt, and liver. Garnish the 
dish with fried parsley, lemon, barberries, horseradish, and 
fried fish. 

Crab, to dress. 

Take all the body and the meat of the legs, and put them 
together in a dish to heat, with a little broth or gravy, just to 
make them moist. When hot, have ready some good broth or 
gravy, with an anchovy dissolved in it, and the juice of a small 
lemon, heated ; afterwards thicken it up with butter, and stir it 
in the crab, as it is, hot : then serve all up in the shell. 

Crab or Lobster, to butter. 
The crabs or lobsters being boiled and cold, take all the meat 
out of the shells and body ; break the claws and take out the 
meat. Shred it small ; add a spoonful or two of claret, a little 
vinegar, and a grated nutmeg. Let it boil up till it is thoroughly 
hot ; then put in some melted butter, with anchovies and white 



FISH. 65 

gravy ; thicken with the yolk of an egg or two, and when very 
hot put it into the large shell. Put crumbs of bread over it. 
and brown it with a salamander. 

Crab, or Lobster, to stew. No. 1 . 
A little cayenne, vinegar, butter, flour, and salt. Cover it 
with water and let it stew gently. 

Crab, or Lobster, to stew. No. 2. 
When the lobsters are boiled, take out the tail and claws, and 
dip them in white wine; strew over them nutmeg, cloves, 
mace, salt, and pepper, mixed together. Then pour over them 
some melted butter with a little white wine in it ; send them 
to the bakehouse, and let them stand in a slow oven about half 
an hour. Pour out the butter and wine, and pour on some fresh 
butter ; when cold, cover them, and keep them in a cold place. 

Crab, or Lobster, to stew. No. 3. 
Boil the lobsters ; when cold take out all the meat ; season 
it well with pepper, salt, nutmeg and mace pounded. Put it 
into an earthen pot with as much clarified butter as will cover 
it ; bake it well. While warm, take it out of the pot, and let 
the butter drain from it. Break it as fine as you can with a 
spoon or knife ; add more seasoning if required ; put it as close 
as possible in the pot, and cover with clarified butter. The hen 
lobsters are best for this purpose, as the eggs impart a good 
colour. It may be pounded in a marble mortar, but, if baked 
enough, will do as well without it. 

Crawfish, to make red. 
Rub the fish with aqua vitse, which will produce the desired 
effect most completely. 

Eels broiled whole. 
Skin, wash, and dry your eels, and score them with the 
knife, seasoning them with pepper, salt, thyme, parsley, and 
crumbs of bread, turning them round and skewering them 
across ; you may either roast or broil them as you like best : 
the sauce to be melted butter with lemon juice. 

Eels, to collar. 

Scour large silver eels with salt ; slit them, and take out the 

back-bones; wash and dry them; season with shred parsley, sage, 

an onion, and thyme. Then roll each into collars, in a cloth ; 

tie them close with the heads, bones, and a bundle of herbs. 



66 FISH. 

and boil them in salt and water. When tender, take them 
up, and again tie them close ; drain the pickle, and put them 
into it. 

Eels, to fry. 

Cut every eel into eight pieces; mix them with a proper 
quantity of yolks of eggs, and well season with pepper, and salt, 
and bread rubbed fine, with parsley and thyme; then flour 
them, and fry them. You may cook them as plain as you like, 
with only salt and flour, and serve them up with melted butter 
and fried parsley. 

Eels, to pot. 

Into an earthen pan put Jamaica and common pepper, 
pounded fine, and salt ; mix them and strew some at the bottom 
of the pan ; cut your eels and lay them over it, and strew a 
little more seasoning over them. Then put in another layer 
of eels, repeating this process till all the eels are in. Lay a 
few bay leaves upon them, and pour as much vinegar as you 
may think requisite; cover the pan with brown paper and 
bake them. Pour ofi^ the liquor, cover them with clarified 
butter, and lay them by for use. 

Eels, to pickle. 
Drain, wash, and well cleanse your eels, and cut ofi^ the 
heads. Cut them in lengths of four or five inches, with their 
skins on ; stew in them some pepper and salt, and broil them 
on a gridiron a fine colour : then put them in layers in a jar, 
with bay-leaf, pepper, salt, a few slices of lemon, and a few 
cloves. Pour some good vinegar on them ; tie strong paper 
over, and prick a few holes in it. It is better to boil the sea- 
soning with some sweet herbs in the vinegar, and let it stand 
to be cold before it is put over the eels. Two yolks of eggs 
boiled hard should be put in the vinegar with a tea- spoonful 
of flour of mustard. Two yolks are sufficient for twelve pounds 
of eels. 

Eels, to roast. 
Skin your eels ; turn, scotch, and wash them with melted 
butter ; skewer them crosswise ; fix them on the spit, and put 
over them a little pepper, salt, parsley, and thyme ; roast them 
quick. Fry some parsley, and lay it round the dish ; make 
your sauce of butter and gravy. 

Eels, to spitchcock. 
lieave the skin on the eels ; scour them with salt ; wash them; 
cut off their heads and slit them on the belly side; take out the 
bone and guts. Wash and wipe them well ; cut them in pieces 



FISH. 67 

three inches long, and wipe them quite dry. Put two ounces of 
butter, with a litUe minced parsley, thyme, sage, pepper and salt, 
and a little chopped shalot, in a stewpan ; when the butter is 
melted, stir the ingredients together, and take the pan off the 
fire ; mix the yolks of two eggs with them and dip the eels in, 
a piece at a time ; then roll them in bread crumbs, making as 
much stick on as you can. Rub the gridiron with a bit of suet; 
set it ,over a clear fire, and broil your eels of a fine crisp brown ; 
dust them with crisp parsley. Sauce, anchovy and butter, or 
plain butter in a boat. 

Another way. 

Wash your eels well in their skins with salt and water ; dry 
and slit them ; take out the back-bone, and slash them : season 
them with chopped parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Clean 
the inside with melted butter; cut them into pieces about three 
inches long and broil them ; make the sauce with butter and 
orange juice. 

Eels, to stew. 

Take five pounds of middling shafflings, cut off their heads, 
skin, and cut them in pieces as long as your finger. Wash 
them in several waters ; dry them well with a cloth, lay them 
in a pan, sprinkle over them half an ounce of white salt, and let 
them lie an hour. Lay them in a stewpan, and add half a pint 
of French white wine, a quarter of a pint of water, two cloves 
beaten, a blade of mace, a large onion peeled, and the rind of 
a lemon ; stew all these gently half an hour : then take the eels 
out of the liquor, skim off all the fat, and flour the eels all 
over ; put to the liquor in which they were stewed an an- 
chovy, washed and boned, and mix sorrel and parsley, half a 
handful of each, and half a pound of fresh butter. Let it just 
boil up ; put in the eels ; when they boil, lay them on sippets 
in your dish, and send them up hot to table. 

Another way. 
Cover the fish close in a stewpan with a piece of butter as 
big as a walnut rolled in flour, and let it stew till done enough, 
which you will know by the eels being very tender. Take them 
up and lay them on a dish ; strain your sauce, and give it a 
quick boil and pour it over the fish. Garnish with lemon. 

Fish, to recover when tainted. 
When fish of any kind is tainted plunge it in cold milk, which 
will render it sweet again. 



68 FISH. 

Fish, in general, to dress. 

Take water, salt, half a pint of vinegar, a sprig of thyme, a 
small onion, and a little lemon peel ; boil them all together, 
then pat in your fish, and when done enough take them out, 
drain them well, and lay them over a stove to keep hot. 

If you fry fish, strew some crumbs of grated bread very fine 
over them, and fry them in sweet oil ; then drain them well 
and keep them hot. 

Fish, to dress in Sauce. 

Cut off the heads, tails, and fins, of two or three haddocks or 
other small fish ; stew them in a quart of water, with a little 
spice and anchovy, and a bunch of sweet herbs, for a quarter 
of an hour ; and then skim. Roll a bit of butter in flour, and 
thicken the liquor ; put down the fish, and stew them with a 
little chopped parsley, and cloves, or onions. 

Fish hashed in Paste, 

Cut the fish into dice about three quarters of an inch square ; 
prepare white sauce the same as for fowls, leaving out the 
mushrooms and truffles ; add a little anchovy sauce to give 
it a good colour, and a pinch of cayenne pepper and salt. 
When the sauce is done, throw in the dice of fish, and when 
thoroughly hot serve it. 

There should be a little more butter in the sauce than is 
commonly used in the white sauce for fowls. 

Fish, to Cavietch. 
Cut the fish into slices, season them with pepper and salt, 
and let them lie for an hour ; dry them well with a cloth, flour 
and fry them brown in oil : boil a quantity of vinegar propor- 
tionate to that of the fish to be prepared : cover the fish 
with slices of garlic and some whole pepper and mace ; add 
the same quantity of oil as vinegar, mix them well together, 
and salt to your taste. When the fish and liquor are quite 
cold, slice onions and lay at the bottom of the pan ; then put a 
layer of fish, and so on, till the whole is in. The liquor must 
be cold before it is poured on the fish. 

Ghidgeon. 
Dress as you would smelts. 

Haddocks, to bake. 
Bone two or three haddocks, and lay them in a deep pan 
with pepper, salt, butter and flour, and two or three anchovies, 
and sufficient water to cover them. Cover the pan close for 



FISH. 69 

' an hour, which is required to bake them, and serve them in 
the saucepan. 

Haddock baked. 
Let the inside of the gills be drawn out and washed clean ; 
fill with bread crumbs, parsley, sweet herbs chopped, nutmeg, 
salt, pepper, a bit of butter, and grated lemon-peel ; skewer 
the tail into the mouth, and rub it well with yolk of egg. Strew 
over bread crumbs, and stick on bits of butter. Bake the fish 
in a common oven, putting into the dish a little white wine 
and water, a bit of mace, and lemon-peel. Serve up with 
oyster sauce, white fish sauce, or anchovy sauce ; but put to 
the sauce what gravy is in the dish, first skimming it. 

Haddock Pudding, 

Skin the fish; take out all the bones, and cut it in thin 
slices. Butter the mould well, and throw round it the spawn 
of a lobster, before it is boiled. Put alternate slices of had- 
dock and lobster in the mould, and season to your taste. Beat 
up half a pint of cream or more, according to the size of the 
mould, with three eggs, and pour on it: tie a cloth over, -and 
boil it an hour. Stew oysters to go in the dish. Garnish with 
pastry. 

Herring. 

The following is a Swedish dish : Take salted herring, some 
cold veal, an apple, and an onion, mince them all fine, and mix 
them well together with oil and vinegar. 

Lampreys, to pot. 
Well cleanse your lampreys in the following manner : the 
intestines and the pipe which nature has given them instead of 
a bone must be taken clear away, by opening them down the 
belly from head to tail. They must then be rubbed with wood- 
ashes, to remove the slime. Then rub with salt, and wash them 
in three or four waters. Let them be quite free from water 
before you proceed to season them thus : — take, according to 
- the quantity you intend to pot, allspice ground with an equal 
quantity of black pepper, a little mace, cayenne pepper, salt, 
about the same quantity as that of all the other seasoning ; mix 
these well together, and rub your lampreys inside and out. Put 
them into an earthen pan or a well-tinned copper stewpan, 
with some good butter under and over, sufficient to cover them, 
when dissolved. Put in with them a few bay-leaves and the 
peel of a lemon. Let them bake slowly till they are quite done ; 
then strain ofi^ the butter, and let them lie on the back of a sieve 
till nearly cold. Then place them in pots of suitable size, tak- 



70 FISH, 

ing great care to rub the seasoning well over them as yoa lay 
them in ; because the seasoning is apt to get from the fish 
when you drain them. Carefully separate the butter which 
you have strained from the gravy ; clarify it, and, when almost 
cold, pour it into your pots so as to cover your fish completely. 
If you have not sufficient butter for this purpose you must cla- 
rify more, as the fish must be entirely hid from sight. They 
are fit for use the next day. 

Great care must be taken to put them into the pots quite 
free from the gravy or moisture which they produce. 

Another way. 
Skin your fish, cleanse them with salt, and wipe them dry. 
Beat some black pepper, mace, and cloves ; mix them with salt, 
and season your fish with it. Put them in a pan ; cover with 
clarified butter ; bake them an hour and season them well ; 
remove the butter after they are baked ; take them out of their 
gravy, and lay them on a coarse cloth to drain. When quite 
cold, season them again with the same seasoning. Lay tliem 
close in the pot ; cover them completely with clarified butter ; 
and if your butter is good, they will keep a long time. 

Lobsters, to butter. 

Put by the tails whole, to be laid in the middle of the dish ; 
cut the meat into large pieces ; put in a large piece of butter, 
and two spoonfuls of Rhenish wine ; squeeze in the juice of a 
lemon, and serve it up. 

Lobster Fricassee, 

Cut the meat of a lobster into dice ; put it in a stewpan 

with a little veal gravy ; let it stew for ten minutes. A little 

before you send it to table beat up the yolk of an e^g in cream: 

vput it to your lobster, stirring it till it simmers. Pepper and salt 

to your taste. Dish it up very hot, and garnish with lemon« 

Lobsters, to hash. 

Take the meat out of a boiled lobster as whole as you can. 
Break all the shells ; to these and the remains of the body, the 
large daws excepted, as they have no goodness in them, put 
some water, cayenne pepper, salt, and common pepper. Let 
them stew together till the liquor has a good flavour of the 
lobster, but observe that there must be very little water, and 
add two teaspoonfuls of anchovy pickle. Strain through a 
common sieve ; put the meat of the lobster to the gravy ; add 
some good rich melted butter, and send to table. Lobster 
sauce is made in the same way, only the meat should be cut 
smaller than for hashing. Hen lobsters are best. 



FISH. 71 

Lobsters, to pot. 
Boil four moderate-sized lobsters, take off the tails, and split 
tiiem. Take out the flesh as whole as possible ; pick the meat 
out of the body and chine ; beat it fine, and season with pep- 
per, salt, nutmeg, and mace, and season separately, in the same 
manner, the tails and claws, which must also be taken out as 
whole as you can. Clarify a pound of the very finest butter ; 
skim it clean ; put in the tails and claws, with what you have 
beaten, and let it boil a very short time, stirring it all the while 
lest it should turn. Let it drain through a sieve, but not too 
much ; put it down close in a pot, and, when it is a little cooled, 
pour over the butter which you drained from it. When quite 
cold, tie it down. The butter should be the very best, as it 
mixes with the lobster spawn, &c., and is excellent to eat with 
the rest or spread upon bread. 

Lobsters, to stew. 
Half boil two fine lobsters ; break the claws and take out the 
meat as whole as you can ; cut the tails in two, and take out 
the meat ; put them in a stewpan, with half a pint of gravy, a 
gill of white wine, a little beaten mace, cayenne pepper, salt, 
a spoonful of ketchup, a little anchovy liquor, and a little but- 
ter rolled in flour. Cover and stew them gently for twenty 
minutes. Shake the pan round frequently to prevent the con- 
tents from sticking ; squeeze in a little lemon. Cut the chines 
in fouE ; pepper, salt, and broil them. Put the meat and saucer 
in a dish, and the chines round for garnish. 

Lobster Curry Powder. 
Eleven ounces of coriander seed, six drachms of cayenne 
pepper, one ounce of cummin, one ounce and a half of black 
pepper, one ounce and a half of turmeric, three drachms of 
cloves, two drachms of cardamoms. 

Lobster Path. 

Rnb two ounces of butter well into half a pound of flour ; 
add one yolk of an ^g^ and a little water, and make it into a 
stiff paste. Sheet your pat^ moulds very thin, fill them with 
crumbs of bread, and bake lightly. Turn out the crumbs and 
save them. Cut your lobster small ; add to it a little white 
sauce, and season with pepper and salt. Take care that it is 
not too thin. Fill your moulds; cover with the crumbs which 
you saved, and a quarter of an hour before dinner put them 
into the oven to give them a light colour. 

Oyster pat^s are done the same way. 



72 FISH. 

Lobster Salad, 
Boil a cauliflower, pull it in pieces, and put it in a dish with 
a little pepper, salt, and vinegar. Have four or five hard- 
boiled eggs, boiled beet-root, small salad, and some anchovies, 
nicely cleaned and cut in lengths. Put a layer of small salad 
at the bottom of the dish, then a layer of the cauliflower, then 
the eggs cut in slices, then the beet, and so on. Take the 
claws and tail of the lobster, cut as whole as possible, and 
trim, to be laid on the top. The trimmings and what you can 
get out may be put in at the time you are laying the cauli- 
flower, &c. in the dish. Make a rich salad sauce with a little 
elder vinegar in it, and pour it over. Lay the tails and claws 
on the top, and cross the shreds of the anchovies over them. 

Mackarel h la maitre d'hoteh 
Boil the fish, and then put it in a stewpan, with a piece of 
butter and sweet herbs. Set it on the fire till the butter be- 
comes oil. 

MacknreL to boil. 
Boil them in salt and water with a little vinegar. Fennel 
sauce is good to eat with them, and also coddled gooseberries. 

Mackarel, to broil. 
You may split them or broil them whole ; pepper and salt 
them well. For sauce, scald some mint and fennel, chop them 
small ; then melt some butter and put your herbs in. You may 
scald some gooseberries and lay over your mackarel. 

Mackarel, to collar. 
Collar them as eels, only omit the sage, and add sweet 
herbs, a little lemon-peel, and seasoning to your taste. 

Mackarel, to fry. 
For frying you may stufi^ the fish with crumbs of bread, 
parsley well chopped, lemon-peel grated, pepper and salt, 
mixed with yolk of e^g. Serve up with anchovy or fennel 
sauce. 

Mackarel, to pickle. 
Cut the mackarel into four or five pieces; season them very 
high ; make slits with a penknife, put in the seasoning, and 
fry them in oil to a good brown colour. Drain them very dry ; 
put them into vinegar, if they are to be kept for any time; 
pour oil on the top. 

Mackarel, to pot. 
Proceed in the same manner as with eels. 



FISH. 73 

Mackarel, to souse. 

Wash and clean your fish : take out the roes, and boil them 
in salt and water ; when enough, take them out and lay them 
in the dish ; pour away half the liquor they were boiled in, 
and add to the rest of the liquor as much vinegar as will 
cover them and two or three bay leaves. Let them lie three 
days before they are eaten. 

Mackarel Pie. 

Cut the fish ^nto four pieces ; season them to your taste with 
pepper, salt, and a little mace, mixed with a quarter of a 
pound of beef suet, chopped fine. Put at the bottom and top, 
and between the layers of fish, a good deal of young parsley, 
and instead of water a little new milk in the dish for gravy. 
If you like it rich, warm about a quarter of a pint of cream, 
which pour in the pie when baked ; if not, have boiled a little 
gravy with the heads. It will take the same time to bake as a 
veal pie. 

Mullet, to boil. 

Let them be boiled in salt and water, and, when you think 
them done enough, pour part of the water from them, and put 
a pint of red wine, two onions sliced, some nutmeg, salt, and 
vinegar, beaten mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, and the juice of 
a lemon. Boil all these well together, with two or three an- 
chovies ; put in your fish ; and, when they have simmered some 
time, put them into a dish and strain the sauce over. If you 
like, shrimps or oysters may be added. 

Mullet, to broil. 
Let the mullet be scaled and gutted, and cut gashes in 
their sides ; dip them in melted butter, and broil them at a 
great distance from the fire. Sauce — anchovy, with capers, 
and a lemon squeezed into il. 

Mullet, to fry. 
Carefully scale and gut the fish, score them across the back, 
and then dip them into melted butter. Melt some butter in a 
stewpan ; let it clarify. Fry your mullet in it ; when done, 
lay them on a warm dish. Sauce — anchovy and butter. 

Oysters, to stew. 
Take a quart of large oysters ; strain the liquor from them 
through a sieve ; wash them well, and take ofi^ the beards. 
Put them in a stewpan, and drain the hquor from the settlings. 
Add to the oysters a quarter of a pound of butter mixed with 
flour and a gill of white wine, and grate in a little nutmeg 



74 FISH. 

with a gill of cream. Keep them stirred till they are ^uite 
thick and smooth. Lay sippets at the bottom of the dish ; 
pom* in your oysters, and lay fried sippets all round. 

Another way. 

Put a quarter of a pound of butter into a clean stewpan, 
and let it boil. Strain a pint of oysters from their liquor; put 
them into the butter ; and let them stew with some parsley 
minced small, a little shalot shred small, and the yolks of three 
eggs well beaten up with the liquor strained from the oysters. 
Put all these together into the stewpan with half a pound more 
butter ; shake it and stew them a little ; if too much, you make 
the oysters hard. 

Oysters, ragout of. 

Twenty-five oysters, half a table- spoonful of soy, double the 
quantity of vinegar, a piece of butter, and a little pepper, salt, 
and fiour. 

Oysters, to pickle. 

Blanch the oysters, and strain off the liquor ; wash the oys- 
ters in three or four waters ; put them into a stewpan, with 
their liquor and half a pint of white wine vinegar, two onions 
sliced thin, a little parsley and thyme, a blade of mace, six 
cloves, Jamaica pepper, a dozen corns of white pepper, and 
salt according to your taste. Boil up two or three minutes ; 
let them stand till cold ; then put them into a dish, and pour 
the liquor over them. 

Oyster Pates. No. 1 . 
Stew the oysters in their own liquor, but do not let them be 
too much done ; beard them ; take a table-spoonful of pickled 
mushrooms, wash them in two or three cold waters to get out 
the vinegar; then cut each mushroom into four, and fry them 
in a little butter dusted over with flour. Take three table- spoon- 
fuls of veal jelly, and two spoonfuls of cream ; let it boil, stir- 
ring all the while; add a small bit of butter. Season with a 
pinch of salt, and one of cayenne pepper. Throw the oysters, 
which you have kept warm in a cloth near the fire, into the 
sauce ; see that it is all hot; then have the pat^s ready, fill 
them with the oysters and sauce, and put a top on each. 
When the paste of oyster pat^s is done, remove the tops gently 
and cleanly with a knife ; take out the flaky part of the paste 
inside and from the inside of the top ; cut six little pieces of 
bread square so as to fill the hiside; lay on the top of the 
paste. Then place them on a sheet of paper in a dish, and put 
them before the fire, ooyering them with a cloth to keep them 



FISH. 75 

hot. When you are going to serve them take out the piece of 
bread, and fill the pat^s with the oysters and sauce. 

Oyster Path, No. 2. 
Spread some puff-paste about half an inch thick. Cut out 
six pieces with a small tea-cup. Rub a baking sheet over with 
a brush dipped in water, and put the pat^s on it at a little dis- 
tance from each other. Glaze them thoroughly with the yolk 
and white of q^^ mixed up ; open a hole at the top of each 
with a small knife; cut six tops of the size of a crown-piece, 
and place them lightly on the pat^s. Let them be baked, and 
when done remove the tops, and place the crust on paper till 
ready to serve up ; then fill them with oysters (as described 
in the preceding recipe) put the tops over them, and dish 
them upon a folded napkin. 

Oyster Path. No. 3. 
Parboil your oysters, and strain them from their liquor, 
wash the beard, and cut them in flour. Put them in a stew- 
pan, with an ounce of butter rolled in flour, half a gill of cream, 
and a little grated lemon-peel, if liked. Free the oyster liquor 
from sediment, reduce it by boiling to one half ; add cayenne 
pepper and salt. Stir it over the fire, and fill your pat^s. 

Oyster Loaves, 
Cut out the crumb of three French rolls ; lay them before 
the fire till they are hot through, turning them often. Melt 
half a pound of butter ; put some into the loaves ; put on their 
tops, and boil them till they are buttered quite through. Then 
take a pint of oysters, stewed with half a pint of water, one 
anchovy, a little pepper and salt, a quarter of a pound of 
butter, and as much sauce as will make your sauce thick. 
Give it a boil. Put as many oysters into your loaves as will 
go in ; pour the rest of the sauce all over the loaves in the 
dish in which they are served up. 

Oyster Pie, 

Beard the oysters ; scald and strain them from their liquor, 
and season the liquor with pepper, salt, and anchovy, a lump 
of butter, and bread crumbs. Boil up to melt the anchovies ; 
then just heat your oysters in it ; put them all together into 
your pie-dish, and cover them with a puff-paste. 

If you put your oysters into a fresh pie, you must cover them 
at the top with crisped crumbs of bread ; add more to the sa- 
vouring if you like it, 

E 2 



76 FISH. 

Perch, to fricassee. 
Boil the perch, and strip them of the bones ; half cover them 
with white wine ; put in two or three anchovies, a litle pepper 
and salt, and warm it cyver the fire. Put in a little parsley 
and oniQUs, with yolks of eggs well beaten. Toss it together; 
put in a little thick butter ; and serve it up. 

Pike, to dress. 
If you would serve it as a first dish, do not scale it ; take off 
the gills, and, having gutted it, boil it in court bouillon, as a side- 
dish, or entree. It may be served in many ways. Cut it into 
pieces, and put it into a stewpan, with a bit of butter, a bunch 
of all sorts of sweet herbs, and some mushrooms ; turn it a few 
times over the fire, and shake in a little flour ; moisten it with 
some good broth and a pint of white wine, and set it over a 
brisk fire. When it is done, add a trifle of salt and cayenne 
pepper, the yolk of three eggs, and half a pint of cream, stir- 
ring it till well mixed. Serve up hot. 

Pike stuffed, to boil. 

Clean a large pike ; take out the gills ; prepare a stuffing 
with finely grated bread, all sorts of sweet-herbs, particularly 
thyme, some onions, grated lemon-peel, oysters chopped small, 
a piece of butter, the boiled yolk of two eggs, and a suffi- 
cient quantity of suet to hold the ingredients together. Put 
them into the fish, and sew it up. Turn the tail into the mouth, 
and boil it in pump water, with two spoonfuls of vinegar and 
a handful of salt. It will take forty minutes to boil, if a large 
fish. 

Pike, to boil, d-la-Fran^aise. 

Wash well, clean, and scale a large pike, and cut it into 
three pieces ; boil an equal quantity of white wine and water 
with lemon-peel, and when the liquor boils put your pike in, 
with a handful of salt. When done, lay it on sippets, and stick 
it with bits of fried bread. Sauce — melted butter, with slices 
of lemon in it, the yolks of three eggs, and some grated nut- 
meg. Pour your sauce over the pike, and serve it up. 

Pike, to broil. 
Split it, and scotch it with a knife on the outside ; season it 
with salt ; put the gridiron on a clear fire, make it very hot, 
then lay on the pike ; baste it with butter, turn it often, and, 
when broiled crisp and stifle put it into a dish, and serve it up 
with butter and the juice of lemons, or white wine vinegar. 
Garnish with slices of oranges or lemons. 



FISH. 77 

Pike in Court Bouillon. 
Scale and well wash your pike ; lay it in a pan ; pour vinegar 
and salt over it ; let it lie for an hour, then take it out, season 
with pepper, a little salt, sweet herhs, cloves, and a hay leaf, 
with a piece of hutter. Wrap it up in a napkin, cmd put it into 
a stewpan, with some white wine, a lemon sliced, a little ver- 
juice, nutmeg, cloves, and a hay leaf. Let this liquor hoil 
very fast ; put in the pike, and when done lay it on a warm 
dish, and strain the liquor into a saucepan; add to it an 
anchovy washed and honed, a few capers, a little water, and a 
piece of bdtter rolled in flour : let these simmer till of proper 
thickness, and pour them over the fish. 

Pike Fricandeau. 
Cut a pike in several pieces, according to its size, after hav- 
ing scaled, gutted, and washed, it. Lard all the upper part with 
bacon cut small, and put it into a stewpan with a glass of red 
wine (or white wine if for white sauce) some good broth, a 
bunch of sweet-herbs, and some lean veal cut into dice. When 
it is stewed and the sauce strained off, complete it in the man- 
ner of any other fricandeau ; putting a good sauce under it, 
either brown or white, as you chuse. 

Pike, German way of dressing — delicious ! 

Take a pike of moderate size ; when well washed and clean- 
sed, split it down the back, close to the bone, in two flat pieces. 
Set it over the fire in a stewpan with salt and water ; half boil 
it. Take it out ; scale it ; put it into the stewpan again, with 
a very little water, and some mushrooms, truffles, and morels, 
an equal quantity, cut small ; add a bunch of sweet herbs. Let 
it stew very gently, closely covered, over a very slow fire, or 
the fish will break ; when it is almost done, take out the herbs, 
put in a cupful of capers, chopped small, three anchovies split 
and shred fine, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a table - 
spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese. Pour in a pint of white 
wine, and cover the stewpan quite close. When the ingredi- 
ents are mixed, and the fish quite done, lay it in a warm dish, 
and pour the sauce over it. 

Pike, to pot. 

After scaling the fish, cut off^ tiie head, split it, take out the 
back-bone, and strew it over with bay salt and pepper. Cover 
and bake it ; lay it on a coarse cloth to drain, and when cold 
put it in a pot that will just hold it, and cover with clarified 
butter. 

If not well drained from the gravy it will not keep. 



78 FISH. 

Pike, to roast. 

Scale and slash the fish from head to tail ; lard it with the 
flesh of eels rolled up in sweet-herhs and seasoning ; fill it with 
fish and forced meat. Roast it at length ; baste and bread it; 
make the sauce of drawn butter, anchovies, the roe and liver; 
with mushrooms, capers, and oysters. Ornament with sliced 
lemon. 

Pike au Souvenir, 

Wash a large pike ; gut and dry it ; make a forcemeat 
with eel, anchovy, whiting, pepper, salt, suet, thyme, bread 
crumbs, parsley, and a bit of shalot, mixed with the yolks of 
eggs ; fill the inside of the fish with this meat ; sew it up ; 
after which draw with your packing-needle a piece of pack- 
thread through the eyes of the pike, through the middle and 
the tail also in the form of S ; wash it over with the yolk of an 
egg, and strew it with the crumbs of bread. Roast or bake it 
wiSi a caul over it. Sauce — melted butter and capers. 

Pike d, la Tatare, or in the Tartar fashion. 
Clean your pike ; gut and scale it ; cut it into bits, and lay 
it in oil, with salt, cayenne pepper, parsley, scallions, mush- 
rooms, two shalots, the whole shred very fine ; grate bread over 
it and lay it upon the gridiron, basting it, while broiling, with 
the rest of the oil. When it is done of a good colour, serve it 
in a dry dish, with sauce d la remoulade [see Sauces] in a sauce- 
boat. 

Fresh Salmon, to dress. 
Cut it in slices, steep it in a little sweet butter, salt and 
pepper, and broil it, basting it with butter while doing. When 
done, serve over it any of the fish sauces, as described (see the 
Sauces), or you may serve it with court bouillon, which will do 
for all kinds of fish whatever. 

Salmon, to dress en caisses, that is, in small paper cases. 
Take two slices of fresh salmon, about the thickness of half 
a finger ; steep it an hour in sweet butter with mushrooms, a 
clove of garlic, and a shalot, all shred fine, half a laurel-leaf, 
thyme, and basil, reduced to a fine powder, salt, and whole pep- 
per. Then make a neat paper box to contain your salmon ; 
rub the outside of it with butter, and put the salmon with all 
its seasoning and covered with grated bread into it ; do it in 
an oven, or put the dish upon a stove, and, when the salmon is 
done, brown it with a salamander. When you serve it, squeeze 
in the juice of a large lemon. If you serve it with Spanish 



FISH. 79 

sauce, the fat must be taken off the salmon before you put 
in the sauce. 

Salmon a la Po'de, or done on the Stove, 
Put three or four slices of fillet of veal, and two or three of 
ham, having carefully cut off the fat of both, at the bottom of 
a stewpan, just the size of the salmon you would serve. 
Lay the salmon upon it, and cover it with thin slices of bacon, 
adding a bunch of parsley, scallions, two cloves of garlic, and 
three shalots. Boil it gently over a moderate stove fire, a 
quarter of an hour ; moisten it with a glass of champagne, 
or fine white wine; let it continue to stew slowly till tho- 
roughly done ; and the moment before you serve it strain off 
the sauce, laying the salmon in a hot dish. Add to the sauce 
five or six spoonfuls of cullis ; let it boil up two or three times, 
and then pour it over the salmon, and serve up. 

Scallops. 

Pick the scallops, and wash them extremely clean ; make 
them very dry. Flour them a very little. Fry them of a fine 
light brown. Make a nice, strong, light sauce of veal and 
a little ham ; thicken a very Httle, and gently stew the scallops 
in it for half an hour. 

Shrimps, to pot. 

Pick the finest shrimps you can procure ; season them with 
a little mace beaten fine, and pepper and salt to your taste. 
Add a little cold butter. Pound all together in a mortar till it 
becomes a paste. Put it into small pots, and pour over it 
clarified butter. 

Another way. 

To a quart of pickled shrimps put two ounces of fresh but- 
ter, and stew them over a moderate fire, stirring them about. 
Add to them while on the fire twelve white peppercorns and 
two blades of mace, beaten very fine, and a very little salt. — 
Let them stew a quarter of an hour : when done, put them 
down close in pots, and pour clarified butter over them when 
cold. 

Smelts, to fry. 

Dry and rub them with yolk of ^^^ ; flour or strew some fine 
bread crum bs on them ; when fried, lay them in the dish with 
their tails in the middle of it. Anchovy sauce. 

Smelts, to pickle. 
Take a quarter of a peck of smelts, and put them into a jar, 
and beat very fine half an ounce of nutmegs, and the same 
quantity of saltpetre and of pepper, a quarter of an ounce of 



80 FISH, 

mace, and a quarter of a pound of common salt. Wash the 
fish; clean gut them, after which lay them in rows in ajar or 
pan ; over every layer of smelts strew your seasoning, with 
some bay-leaves, and pour on boiled red wine sulficient to 
cover them. Put a plate or a cover over, and when cold tie 
them down close. 

Smelts, to pot. 

Clean the inside of the fish, and season them with salt, 
pounded mace, and pepper. Bake them, and when nearly cold 
lay them upon a cloth ; then put them into pots, taking off 
the butter from the gravy ; clarify it with more butter, and poor 
it on them. 

Soles, to boil. 

The soles should be boiled in salt and water. Anchovy 
sauce. 

Soles, to boil, d-la-Frangaise. 

Put a quart of water and half a pint of vinegar into an 
earthen dish ; skin and clean a pair of soles ; put them into 
vinegar and water, let them remain there for two hours. Dry 
them with a cloth, and put them into a stewpan, with a pint 
of wine, a quarter of a pint of water, a little sweet marjoram, 
a very little thyme, an onion stuck with four cloves, and winter 
savory. Sprinkle a very little bay salt, covering them close. 
Let them simmer gently till they are done ; then tSke them out, 
and lay them in a warm dish before the fire. Put into the 
liquor, after it is strained, a piece of butter rolled in flour ; let 
it boil tin of a proper thickness ; lay your soles in the dish, and 
pour the sauce over them. 

A small turbot or any flat fish may be done the same way. 

Soles, to stew. 
Cut and skin the soles, and half fry them ; have ready the 
quantity you hke of half white wine and half water, mixed with 
some gravy, one whole onion, and a little whole pepper. Stew 
them all together, with a little shred lemon, and a few mush- 
rooms. When they are done enough, thicken the sauce with 
good butter, and serve it up. 

Water Souchi. 
Put on a kettle of water with a good deal of salt in it, and a 
good many parsley roots ; keep it skimmed very clean, and 
when it boils up throw in your perch or whatever fish you use 
for the purpose. When sufficiently boiled, take them up and 
serve them hot. Have ready a pint or more of water, in which 
parsley roots have been boiled, till it has acquired a very strong 



FISH. 81 

flavour, and when the fish are dished throw some of this liquor 
over them. The Dutch sauce for them is made thus : — To a 
pint of white wine vinegar add a blade or two of mace ; let it 
stew gently by the fire, and, when the vinegar is sufiiciently 
flavoured by the mace, put into it about a pound of butter. 
Shake the saucepan now and then, and, when the butter is quite 
melted, make all exceedingly hot ; have ready the yolks of four 
good eggs beaten up. You must continue beating them while 
another person gently pours to them the boiling vinegar by 
degrees, lest they should curdle ; and continue stirring them all 
the while. Set it over a gentle fire, still continuing to stir 
until it is very hot and of the thickness you desire ; then serve 
it. 

Sprats, to bake. 

Wipe your sprats with a clean cloth ; rub them with pepper 
and salt, and lay them in a pan. Bruise a pennyworth of 
cochineal ; put it into the vinegar, and pour it over the sprats 
with some bay-leaves. Tie them down close with coarse 
paper in a deep brown pan, and set them in the oven all night. 
They eat very fine cold. 

You may put to them a pint of vinegar, half a pint of red 
wine, and spices if you like it ; but they eat very well without. 

Sturgeon, to roast. 
Put a walnut-sized bit of butter (or more if it is a large fish), 
rolled in flour, in a stewpan, with sweet-herbs, cloves, a gill 
of water, and a spoonful of vinegar ; stir it over the fire, and 
when it is lukewarm take it oflf, and put in your sturgeon to 
steep. When it has been a sufficient time to take the flavour 
of the herbs, roast it, and when done, serve it with court bou- 
illon, or any other fish sauce. 

Turbot, to dress. 

Wipe your turbot very dry, then take a deep stewpan, put 
in the fish, with two bay-leaves, a handful of parsley, a large 
onion stuck with sieves, some salt, and cayenne; heat a pint of 
white wine boiling hot, and pour it upon the turbot j then 
strain in some very strong veal gravy, (made from your stock 
jelly,) more than will cover it ; set it over a stove, and let it 
simmer very gently, that the full strength of the ingredients 
may be infused into it. When it is quite done, put it on a hot 
dish; strain the gravy into a saucepan, with some butter and 
flour to thicken it. 

Plaice, dabs, and flounders, may be dressed in the same 
way.

82 FISH. 

Thirbot, plain boiled. 
Make a brine with two handfuls of salt in a gallon of water, 
let the turbot lie in it two hours before it is to be boiled ; then 
set on a fish-kettle, with water enough to cover it, and about 
half a pint of vinegar, or less if the turbot is small ; put in a 
piece of horseradish ; when the water boils put in the turbot, 
the white side uppermost, on a fish-plate-; let it be done 
enough, but not too much, which will be easily known by the 
look. A small one will take twenty minutes, a large one half 
ail hour. Then take it up, and set it on a fish-plate to drain, 
before it is laid in the dish. See that it is served quite dry. 
Sauce— lobster and white sauce. 

Turbot y to boil. 
Put the turbot into a kettle, with white wine vinegar and 
lemon ; season with salt and onions ; add to these water. Boil 
it over a gentle fire, skimming it very clean. Garnish with 
slices of lemon on the top. 

Turbot, to boil in Gravy. 
Wash and well dry a middling sized turbot ; put it with two 
bay-leaves into a deep stew-dish, with some cloves, a handful of 
parsley, a large onion, and some salt and pepper, add a pint 
of boiling hot white wine, strain in some strong veal gravy 
that will more than cover the fish, and remove it on one side 
that the ingredients may be well mixed together. Lay it on a 
hot dish, strain the gravy into a saucepan with some butter and 
flour, pour a little over the fish, and put the remainder in a 
sauce terrine. 

Turbot, to boil in Court Bouillon, with Capers. 
Be very particular in washing and drying your turbot. 
Take thyme, parsley, sweet-herbs of aU sorts, minced very fine, 
and one large onion sliced ; put them into a stewpan, then 
lay in the turbot — the stewpan should be just large enough to 
hold the fish — strew over the fish the same herbs that are under 
it, with some chives and a little sweet basil ; pour in an equal 
quantity of white wine and white wine vinegar, till the fish is 
completely covered ; strew in a little bay salt with some pepper. 
Set the stewpan over a stove, with a very gentle fire, increas- 
ing the heat by degrees, till it is done sufficiently. Take it ofi^ 
the fire, but do not take the turbot out : let it stand on the 
side of the stove. Set a saucepan on the fire, with a pound of 
butter and two anchovies, split, boned, and carefully cleansed, 
two large spoonfuls of capers cut small, some chives whole, 



FISH. 83 

and a little cayenne, nutmeg grated, a little flour, a spoonful 
of vinegar, and a little broth. Set the saucepan over the stove, 
keep shaking it round for some time, and then leave it at 
the side of the stove. Take up the stewpan in which is the 
turbot, and set it on the stove to make it quite hot ; then put 
it in a deep dish ; and, having warmed the sauce, pour it over 
it, and serve up. 

Soles, flounders, plaice, &c. are all excellent dressed in the 
same way. 

Turbot, to fry. 

It must be a small turbot. Cut it across, as if it were ribbed ; 
when it is quite dry, flour it, and put it into a large frying-pan 
with boiling butter enough to cover it ; fry it brown, then 
drain it. Put in enough claret to cover it, two anchovies, 
salt, a scruple of nutmeg and ginger, and let it stew slowly till 
half the liquor is wasted ; then take it out, and put in a piece 
of butter, of the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, and a lemon 
minced, juice and all. liCt these ingredients simmer till of a 
proper thickness. Rub a hot dish with an eschalot or onion ; 
pour the sauce in, and lay the turbot carefully in the midst. 

Turbot or Barbel, glazed. 
Lard the upper part of your turbot or barbel with fine bacon. 
Let it simmer slowly between slices of ham, with a little cham- 
pagne, or fine white white, and a bunch of sweet-herbs. Pat 
into another stewpan part of a fillet of veal, cut into dice, 
with one slice of ham ; stew them with some fine cuUis, till 
the sauce is reduced to a thick gravy. When thoroughly 
done, strain it off before you serve it, and, with a feather, put 
it over your turbot to glaze it. Then pour some good cuttis 
into the stewpan, and toss it up as a sauce to serve in the dish, 
adding the juice of a lemon. 

Turbot, to dress en gras, or in a rich fashion. 
Put into a stewpan a small quantity of broth, several slices 
of veal, and an equal quantity of ham, a little cayenne, and a 
bunch of sweet-herbs. Let it stew over a very slow stove, and 
add a glass of champagne. When this is completely done, 
serve it with any of the sauces, named in the article Sauces,- 
added to its own. 

Turbot or Barbel, to dress en maigre, or in a lean fashion. 

Put into a stewpan a large handful of salt, a pint of water, 
a clove of garlic, onions, and all sorts of sweet kitchen herbs, 
the greater variety the better, only an equal quantity of each. 



84 FISH. 

Boil the whole half an hour over a slow fire; let it settle. 
Pour off the clear part of the sauce, and strain it through a 
sieve ; then put twice as much rich milk as there is of the hrine, 
and put the fish in it over a very slow fire, letting it simmer 
only. When your turbot is done, pour over it any of the 
sauces named as being proper for fish in the article Sauces. 

Turtle, to dress. 
After having killed the turtle, divide the back and belly, 
cleaning it well from the blood in four or five waters, with 
some salt ; take away the fins from the back, and scrape and 
scald them well from the scales ; then put the meat into the 
saucepan, with a little salt and water just to cover it ; stew 
it, and keep skimming it very clean aU the while it is stew- 
ing. Should the turtle be a large one, put a bottle of white wine ; 
if a small one, half that quantity. It must be stewed an hour 
and a half before you put in the wine, and the scum have done 
rising ; for the wine being put in before turns it hard ; and, 
while it is stewing, put an onion or two shred fine, with a 
little parsley, thyme, salt, and black pepper. After it has 
stewed tender, take it out of the saucepan, and cut it into small 
pieces ; let the back shell be well washed clean from the blood, 
and rub it with salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, and onions, shred 
fine, mixed well together ; put a layer of seasoning into the 
shell, and lay on your-meat, and so continue till the shell is 
filled, covering it with seasoning. If a large turtle, two pounds 
of butter must be cut into bits, and laid between the season- 
ing and the meat. You must thicken the soup with butter 
rolled in flour. An hour and a half is requisite for a large 
turtle. 

Whiting, to dry. 
Take the whiting when they come fresh in, and lay them in 
salt and water about four hours, the water not being too salt. 
Hang them up by the tails two days near a fire, after which, 
skin and broil them. 



MADE DISHES. 



Asparagus forced in French Rolls. 
Takb out the crumb of three French rolls, by first cutting off 
a piece of the to pcrust; but be careful to cut it so neatly that the 
crust fits the place again. Fry the rolls brown in fresh butter. 
Take a pint of cream, the yois of six eggs beaten fine, a little 
salt and nutmeg ; stir them well together over a slow fire until the 
mixture begins to be thick. Have ready a hundred of small aspa- 
ragus boiled ; save tops enough to stick in the rolls ; the rest 
cut small and put into the f ream ; fill the rolls with it. Before 
you fry the rolls, make holes thick in the top crust to stick the 
asparagus in; then lay on the piece of crust, and>9tick it with 
asparagus as if it was growing. 

Eggs, to dress. 
Boil or poach them in the common way. Serve them on a 
piece of buttered toast, or on stewed spinach. 

Eggs buttered. No. 1. 
Take the yolks and whites ; set them over the fire with a bit 
of butter, and a little pepper and salt ; stir them a minute or 
two. When they become rather thick and a little turned in 
small lumps, pour them on a buttered toast. 

Eggs buttered. No. 2. 

Put a lump of butter, of the size of a walnut; beat up 
two eggs ; add a little cream, and put in the stewpan, stirring 
them till they are hot. Add pepper and salt, and lay them on 
toast. 

Eggs buttered. No. 3. 

Beat the eggs well together with about three spoonfuls of 
cream and a little salt ; set the mass over a slow fire, stirring 
till it becomes thick, without boiling, and have a toast ready 
buttered to pour it upon. 



86 MADE DISHES. 

Milk with a little butter, about the size of a walnut, may be 
used instead of the cream. 

EggSy Scotch, 

Take half a pound of the flesh of a fowl, or of veal, or any 
white meat (dressed meat will do), mince it very small with half 
a pound of suet and the crumb of a French roll soaked in cream, 
a little parsley, plenty of lemon-peel shred very small, a little 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; pound all these together, adding a 
raw egg, till they become a paste. Boil as many eggs as you 
want very hard ; take out the yolks, roll them up in the force- 
meat, and make them the size and shape of an egg. Fry 
them till they are of a light brown, and toss them up in a good 
brown sauce. Quarter some hard-boiled eggs, and spread them 
over your dish. 

Eggs for second Course. 

Boil five eggs quite hard ; clear away the shells, cut them in 
half, take out the yolks, and put the whites into warm water. 
Pound the yolks in a mortar till they become very fine. Have 
ready some parsley and a little onion chopped as fine as pos- 
sible ; add these to the yolks, with a pinch of salt and cayenne 
pepper. Add a sufficient quantity of hot cream to make it into 
a thick even paste ; fill the halves of the whites with this, and 
keep the whole in hot water. Prepare white sauce ; place the 
eggs on a dish in two rows, the broad part downward ; pour 
the sauce over them, and serve up hot. 

JEggs to fry as round as Balls. 
Put three pints of clarified butter into a deep stewpan ; heat 
it as hot as for fritters, and stir the butter with a stick tiU it 
turns round like a whirlpool. Break an egg into the middle, 
and turn it round with the stick till it is as hard as a poached 
egg. The whirling round of the butter makes it as round as 
a ball. Take it up with a slice ; put it in a dish before the fire. 
Do as many as you want ; they will be soft, and keep hot half 
an hour. Serve on stewed spinach. 

Eggs, fricassee of 
Boil the eggs pretty hard ; cut them in round slices ; make 
white sauce and pour it over them ; lay sippets round your dish, 
and put a whole yolk in the middle. 

Eggs d la Creme. 
Boil the eggs, which must be quite fresh, twelve minutes ; 
and throw them into cold water. When cold, take off the shell

without breaking the white. Have a little shalot and parsley 
minced fine and mixed ; pass it with a little fresh butter. When 
done enough, set it to cool. Cut the eggs through the middle; 
put the whites into warm water ; pound the yolks very fine ; 
put them into your stewpan, with a little cream, pepper, and 
salt. Make the whole very hot, and dish. Two gills of cream 
will be sufficient for ten eggs. 

Ham, essence of. 
Take six pounds of ham ; cut oS all the skin and fat, and cut 
the lean into slices about an inch thick ; lay them in the bot- 
tom of a stewpan, with slices of carrots, parsnips, six onions 
sliced ; cover down very close, and set it over a stove. Pour 
on a pint of veal cullis by degrees, some fresh mushrooms cut 
in pieces, if to be had, if not, mushroom powder, truffles, mo- 
rels, two cloves, a basil leaf, parsley, a crust of bread, and a 
leek. Cover down close, and let it simmer till the meat is quite 
dissolved. A little of this sauce will flavour any lighter sauce 
with great zest and delicacy. 

Maccaroni in a mould of Pie Crust. 
Prepare a paste, as generally made for apple-pies, of an oval 
shape ; put a stout bottom to it and no top ; let it bake by the 
fire till served. Prepare a quarter of a pound of maccaroni, boil 
it with a little salt and half an ounce of butter ; when done, put 
it in another stewpan with an ounce more of butter, a little 
grated cheese, and a spoonful of cream. Drain the maccaroni, 
and toss it till the cheese be well mixed ; pour it into a dish ; 
sprinkle some more grated cheese over it, and baste it with a 
little butter. When ready to be served, put the maccaroni into 
the paste, and dish it up hot without browning the cheese. 

Maccaroni, to dress. No. 1. 

Stew one pound of gravy beef to a rich gravy, with turnips 
and onions, but no carrots ; season it high with cayenne, and 
fine it with whites of eggs. When the gravy is cold, put in 
the maccaroni ; set it on a gentle fire ; stir it often that it may 
not bum, and let it stew an hour and a half. When you serve 
it up add of Cheshire cheese grated as much as will make the 
maccaroni relishing. 

Maccaroni. No. 2. 

Boil two ounces of maccaroni in plenty of water an hour and 
a half, and drain it through a sieve. Put it into a saucepan, 
and beat a little bit of butter, some pepper and salt, and as 
much grated cheese as will give a proper flavour. Put it into

cream. Set it on the fire, and stew it up. Put it on your dish; 
strew a little grated cheese over it, and brown with a sala- 
mander. 

Maccaroni, No. 3. 
Boil the maccaroni till tender ; cut it in pieces about two 
inches long ; put it into either white or brown sauce, and let 
it stew gently for half an hour. Either stir in some grated 
cheese, or send it in plain. Pepper and salt to your taste. 

Maccaroni, No. 4. 

Soak a quarter of a pound of maccaroni in milk for two 
hours ; put it into a stewpan, boil it well, and thicken with a 
little flour and butter. Season it with pepper and salt to your 
taste ; and add three table-spoonfuls of cream. Put it in a dish ; 
add bread crumbs and sliced cheese, and brown with a sala- 
mander. 

Maccaroni, No, 5. 

Set on the fire half a gallon of water ; when it boils put into 
it one pound of maccaroni, with a quarter of a pound of salt ; 
let it boil a quarter of an hour, then strain very dry, put it in 
a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter ; let it fry 
a quarter of an hour longer. Add pepper id grated cheese ; 
stew them together ; then put the maccaror ito a terrine, and 
shake some grated cheese on it. It is very good with a-la-mode 
beef gravy instead of butter. 

Maccaroni, No. 6. 

Boil a quarter of a pound of maccaroni till it is quite tender ; 
lay it on a sieve to drain ; then put it into a tossing-pan with 
about a gill of cream and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Boil 
five minutes, pour it on a plate, and lay Parmesan cheese toasted 
all over it. 

Maccaroni, No. 7. 

Break a quarter of a pound of pipe maccaroni into pieces 
about an inch long, put it into a quart of boiling broth ; boil 
it for three hours ; then strain it off from the broth, and make 
a sauce with a bit of butter, a little flour, some good broth, and 
a little cream ; when it boils add a little Parmesan cheese. Put 
your maccaroni into the sauce, and just stir it together. Put it 
on the dish for table, with grated Parmesan cheese over it, and 
give it a good brown colour with a hot shovel or salamander. 

Maccaroni, No. 8.

over a charcoal fire, with three or four spoonfuls of fresh cream, 
one ounce of butter, and a little grated Parmesan cheese. Set 
it over a slow fire till quite hot, but it must not boil ; pour it 
into your hot dish ; shake a little of the cheese over the top, 
and brown with a salamander. 

Omelets 
should be fried in a small frying-pan, made for the purpose ; 
with a small quantity of butter. Their great merit is to be 
thick ; therefore use only half the number of whites that you 
do of yolks of eggs. The following ingredients are the basis 
of all omelets : parsley, shalot, a portion of sweet-herbs, ham, 
tongue, anchovy, grated cheese, shrimps, oysters, &c. 

Omelet. No. 1. 
Slice very thin two onions, about tVo ounces each ; put them 
in a stewpan with three ounces of butter ; keep the pan covered 
till done, stirring now and then, and, when of a nice brown, stir 
in as much flour as will produce a stiff paste. Add by degrees 
as much water or milk as will make it the thickness of good 
cream, and stew it with pepper and salt ; have ready hard- 
boiled eggs (four or five) ; you may either shred or cut them 
in halves or quarters. 

Omelet. No. 2. 
Beat five eggs lightly together, a small quantity of shalot, 
shred quite fine ; parsley, and a few mushrooms. Fry, and 
be careful not to let it bum. When done add a little sauce. 

Omelet. No. 3. 
Break five eggs into a basin ; add half a pint of cream, a 
table-spoonful of flour, a little pounded loaf-sugar, and a little 
salt. Beat it up with a whisk for five minutes ; add candied 
citron and orange peel ; fry it in two ounces of butter. 

Omelet. No. 4. 
Take six or seven eggs, a gill of good cream, chopped parsley, 
th3rrae, a very small quantity, shalot, pepper, salt, and a little 
grated nutmeg. Put a little butter in your frying-pan, which 
must be very clean or the omelet will not turn out. When 
your butter is melted, and your omelet well beat, pour it in, 
put it on a gentle fire, and as it sets keep moving and mixing 
it with a spoon. Add a little more butter if required. When 
it is quite loose from the bottom, turn it over on the dish in 
which it is to be served. 



90 MADE DISHES. 

Omelet, No. 5. 

Break eight eggs into an earthen pan, with a little pepper 
and salt, and water sufficient to dissolve the salt ; beat the eggs 
well. Throw an ounce and a half of fresh butter into a frying- 
pan ; melt it over the fire ; pour the eggs into the pan ; keep 
turning them continually, but never let the middle part be over 
the fire. Gather all the border, and roll it before it is too 
much done ; the middle must be kept hollow. Roll it together 
before it is served. A little chopped parsley and onions may 
be mixed with the butter and eggs, and a little shalot or 
pounded ham. 

Omelet, No. 6. 

Four eggs, a little scraped beef, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, 
lemon peel, parsley, burnet, chervil, and onion, all fried in lard 
or butter. 

AspUragus Omelet, 

Beat up six eggs, put some cream to them. Boil some 
asparagus, cut off the green heads, and mix with the eggs ;

fry the omelet, and serve it hot. 

A French Omelet, 

Beat up six eggs ; put to them a quarter of a pint of cream, 
some pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; beat them well together. 
Put a quarter of a pound of butter, made hot, into your omelet- 
pan, and fry it of a light brown. Double it once, and serve it 
up plain, or with a white sauce imder it. If herbs are prefer- 
red, there should be a little parsley shred, and green onion cut 
very fine, and serve up fried. 

Ragout for made dishes. 

Boil and blanch some cocks' combs, with sweetbreads sliced 
and lambs' stones ; mix them up in gravy, with sweet- herbs, 
truffles, mushrooms, oysters, and savoury spice, and use it 
when you have occasion. 

Trouhindella, 

Chop fine two pounds of veal, fat and lean together ; slice 
crumb of bread into some warm milk : squeeze it out of the 
milk and put it to the veal ; season with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg ; make it up in three .balls, and fry it in butter half an 
hour. Put a quart of mutton or veal broth into the pan, and 
let it stew three quarters of an hour, or till it is reduced to a 
quarter of a pint of strong gravy.

Artichokes, to fricassee. 
Scrape the bottom clean; cut them into large dice, and boil 
them, but not too soft. Stove them in a little cream, seasoned 
with pepper and salt ; thicken with the yolks of four eggs and 
melted butter, and serve up. 

Bacon, to cure. No. 1 . 

Use two pounds of common salt ; one pound of bay salt ; one 
pound of brown sugar ; two ounces of saltpetre ; two ounces 
of groimd black pepper. 

Bacon, to cure. No. 2. 

Take half a pound of saltpetre, or let part of it be petre salt, 
half a pound of bay salt, and one pound of coarse sugar ; pound 
and mix them well together. Rub this mixture well into the 
bacon, and cover it completely with common salt. Dry it 
thoroughly, and keep it well packed in malt dust. 

Bacon, to cure. No. 3. 

For sixty pounds* weight of pork take three pounds of com- 
mon salt, half a pound of saltpetre, and half ar pound of brown

and last of all the common salt. Let the meat lie in salt only 
a week, and then hang it at a good distance from the fire, but 
in a place where a fire is constantly kept. When thoroughly 
dry, remove it into a garret, and there let it remain till wanted 
for use.

Alamode Beef. No. 1 . 
Take a piece of the round of beef, fresh and tender ; beat it 
well, and to six pounds of beef put one pound of bacon, cut 
into large pieces for larding, and season it with pepper, cloves, 
and salt. Lard your beef, and put it into your stewpan, with 
a bay-leaf or two, and two or three onions, a bunch of parsley, 
a little lemon -peel, three spoonfuls of vinegar, and the samt 
quantity of beer. Cover it close, and set it over a gentle char- 
coal fire ; stew it very gently that your liquor may come out ; 
and shake it often to prevent its sticking. As the liquor in- 
creases, make your fire a little stronger, and, when enough done, 
skim off all the fat, and put in a glass of claret. Stew it half 
an hour longer, and when you take it off your fire squeeze in 
the juice of a lemon, and serve up. It must stew iWe hours ; 
and is as good cold as hot. 

Alamode Beef. No. 2. 
Lard the mouse-buttock with fat bacon, sprinkled with par- 
sley, scallions, mushrooms, truffles, morels, one clove of garlic 
shred fine, salt, and pepper. Let it stew five or six hours in 
its own gravy, to which add, when it is about half done, a large 
spoonful of brandy. It should be done in an earthen vessel 
just large enough to contain it, and may be served hot or 
cold. 

Alamode Beef, No. 3. 
Lard a piece of beef with fat bacon, dipped in pepper, vine- 
gar, allspice, and salt ; flour it all over ; cut two or three large 
onions in thin slices ; lay them at the bottom of the stewpan 
with as much butter as will fry your beef ; lay it in and brown 
it all over ; turn it frequently. Pour to it as much boiling 
water as will cover it ; add a little lemon-peel, and a bunch of 
herbs, which must be taken out before done enough ; when it 
has stewed about two hours turn it. When finished, put in 
some mushrooms or ketchup, and serve up. 

Alamode Beef in the French manner. 
Take the best part of the mouse-buttock, between four and 
seven pounds, larded well with fat bacon, and cut in square 
pieces the length and thickness of your beef. Before you lard 
it, take a little mace, six cloves, some pepper and salt, ground 
all together, and mix it with some parsley, shalot, and a few 
sweet-herbs ; chop them small, roll your bacon in this mixture, 
and lard your beef. Skewer it well, and tie it close with a 
string ; put two or three slices of fat bacon at the bottom of 
your stewpan, with three slices of carrot, two onions cut 
in two, and half a pint of water ; put your beef in, and set your 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 93 

stewpan on the fire. After the beef has stewed about ten mi- 
nutes, add more hot water, till it half covers the meat ; let it 
boil till you feel with your finger that your beef is warm or 
hot through. Lay two or three slices of fat bacon upon your 
beef, add a little mace, cloves, pepper, .and salt, a few slices of 
carrot, a small bunch of sweet-herbs, and celery tied together, 
a little garlic if you like it. Cut a piece of paper, of the size 
of your cover ; well grease it with butter or lard ; put it over 
your pan, cover it close, and let it stew over a very slow fire 
seven or eight hours. If you like to eat the beef cold, do not 
uncover the pan till it is so, for it will be the better for it. If 
you choose to stew a knuckle of veal with the beef, it will add 
greatly to the flavour. 

Rump of Beef, with onions. 
Having extracted the bones, tie it compactly in a good 
shape, and stew it in a pan that will allow for fire at the top. 
Put in a pint of white wine, some good broth, a slice of veiaJ, 
two of bacon, or ham, which is better, a large bunch of kitchen 
herbs, pepper and salt. When the beef is nearly half done, 
add a good quantity of onions. The beef being thoroughly 
done, take it out and wipe off the grease ; place it in the dish 
in which it is to be served at table, put the onions round it, 
aud pour over it a good sauce, any that suits your taste. 

Rump of Beef , to bake. 
Bone a rump of beef; beat it thoroughly with a rolling-pin, 
till it is very tender ; cut off the sinew, and lard it with large 
pieces of bacon ; roll your larding seasoning first — of pepper, 
salt, and cloves. Lard athwart the meat that it may cut hand- 
somely ; then season the meat all over with pepper and salt, 
and a little brown sugar. Tie it neatly up with packthread 
across and across, put the top undermost, and place it in an 
earthen pan. Take all the bones that came out of it, and 
put them in round and round the beef, so that it cannot 
stir ; then put in half a pound of butter, two bay-leaves, two 
shalots, and all sorts of seasoning herbs, chopped fine. Cover 
the top of the pot with coarse paste ; put it in a slow oven ; 
let it stand eight hours ; take it out, and serve it in the dish in 
which it is to go to table, with its own juice, and some have 
additional broth or gravy ready to add to it if it is too dry. 

Rump of Beef cardinal fashion. 
Choose a rump of beef of moderate size, say ten or twelve 
pounds ; take out the bones ; beat it, and lard it with a pound 
of the best bacon, mingled with salt and spices, without touch-

ing the upper parts. Rub half a quarter of a pound of salt- 
petre in powder into the meat that it may look red ; and put 
it into a pan with an ounce of juniper-berries a little bruised, 
a tea-spoonful of brown sugar, a little thyme, basil, and a 
pound of salt ; and there let it remain, the pan being covered 
close, for eight days. When the meat has taken the salt, wash 
it in warm water, and put some slices of bacon upon the upper 
part on that side which is covered with fat, and tie a linen 
cloth over it with packthread. Let it stew gently five hours, 
with a pint and a half of red wine, a pint of water, six onions, 
two cloves of garlic, five carrots, two parsnips, a laurel leaf, 
thyme, basil, four or five cloves, parsley, and scallions. When 
it is done, it may be either served up hot, or left to cool in its 
own liquor, and eaten cold. 

Beef, sausage fashion. 
Take a slice of beef, about half an inch thick and four or five 
wide ; cut it in two equal parts ; beat them well to make them 
flat, and pare the edges neatly. Mince your parings with beef 
suet, parsley, onions, mushroom, a shalot, two leaves of basil, 
and mix them into a forcemeat with the yolks of four eggs. 
A little minced ham is a great addition. Spread this force- 
meat upon the slices of beef, and roll them up in the form of 
sausages. Tie them with packthread, and stew them in a little 
broth, a glass of white wine, salt, pepper, an onion stuck with 
cloves, a carrot, and a parsnip. When they are done, strain off 
the liquor, and, having skimmed off the fat, reduce it over the 
fire to the consistence of a sauce ; take care that it be not too 
highly flavoured, and serve it over your sausages, or they may 
be served on sorrel, spiuach, or any other sauce you prefer. 

Ribs and Sirloin of Beef 

When the ribs and sirloin are tender, they are commonly 
roasted, and eaten with their own gravy. To make the sirloin 
still better, take out the fillet : cut it into thin slices, and put 
it into a stewpan, with a sauce made with capers, anchovies, 
mushrooms, a little garlic, truffles, and morels, the whole 
shred fine, turned a few times over the fire, with a little but- 
ter, and moistened with some good cidlis. When the sauce is 
skimmed and seasoned to your taste, put in the fillet with the 
gravy of the meat, and heat and serve it over the ribs or 
sirloin. 

Rib of Beef en papillotes, (in paper J

the sauce till it sticks to the rib, and then steep the rib in but- 
ter, with parsley, scallions, shalots, and mushrooms, shred 
fine, and a little basil in powder. Wrap the rib, together 
with its seasoning, in a sheet of white paper, folding the paper 
round in the form of a curling paper or papillote ; grease the 
outside, and lay it upon the gridiron, on another sheet of 
greased paper, over a slow fire. When it is done, serve it in 
the paper. 

Brisket of Beef, stewed German Fashion, 
Cut three or four pounds of brisket of beef in three or four 
pieces of equal size, and boil it a few minutes in water ; in 
another pan boil the half of a large cabbage for a full quarter 
of an hour ; stew the meat with a little broth, a bunch of pars- 
ley, scallions, a little garlic, thyme, basil, and a laurel-leaf; 
and an hour afterwards put in the cabbage, cut into three 
pieces, well squeezed, and tied with packthread, and three 
large onions. When the whole is nearly done, add four 
sausages, with a little salt and whole pepper, and let it stew 
till the sauce is nearly consumed ; then take out the meat and 
vegetables, wipe off the grease, and dish them, putting the 
beef in the middle, the onions and cabbage round, and the 
sausages upon it. Strain the sauce through a sieve, and, having 
skimmed off the fat, serve it over the ragout. The beef will 
take five hours and a quarter at the least to stew. 

Beef, to bake. 

Take a buttock of beef; beat it in a mortar ; put to it three 
poimds of bacon cut in small pieces ; season with pepper and 
salt, and mix in the bacon with your hands. Put it into a pot, 
with some butter and a bunch of sweet-herbs, covering it very 
close, and let it bake six hours. When enough done, put it 
into a cloth to strain ; then put it again into your pot, and fill 
it up with butter. 

Beef houilli. 

Take the thick part of the brisket of beef, and let it lie in 
water all night ; tie it up well, and put it to boil slowly, with 
a small faggot of parsley and th)rme, a bag of peppercorns 
and allspice, three or four onions, and roots of different sorts : 
it will take five or six hours, as it should be very tender. 
Take it out, cut the string from it, and either glaze it or 
sprinkle some dry parsley that has been chopped very fine over 
it; sprinkle a little flower on the top of it, with gherkin and 
carrot. The chief sauce for it is sauce hachie, which is made 
thus : a little dressed ham, gherkin, boiled carrot, and the yolk 
of e^^ boiled, all chopped fine and put into brown sauce.

Another way. 
Take about eight or nine pounds of the middle part of the 
brisket ; put it into your stew-kettle (first letting it hang up 
for four or five days) with a little whole pepper, salt, and a 
blade or two of mace, a turnip or two, and an onion, adding 
about three pints or two quarts of water. Cover it up close, 
and when it begins to boil skim it ; let it stand on a very slow 
fire, just to keep it simmering. It will take five hours or more 
before it is done, and during that time you must take the meat 
out, in order to skim off the fat. When it is quite tender take 
your stewpan, and brown a little butter and flour, enough to 
thicken the gravy, which you must put through a colander, 
first adding sliced carrots and turnips, previously boiled in an- 
other pot. You may also, if you choose, put in an anchovy, a 
little ketchup, and juice of lemon ; but these are omitted accord- 
ing to taste. When the gravy is thus prepared, put the meat 
in again ; give it a boil, and dish it up. 

Relishing Beef, 
Take a round of the best piece of beef and lard it with bacon ; 
half roast it ; put it in a stewpan, with some gravy, an onion 
stuck with cloves, half a pint of white wine, a gill of vinegar, 
a bunch of sweet-herbs, pepper, cloves, mace, and salt ; cover 
it down very close, and let it only simmer till it is quite tender. 
Take two ox-palates, two sweetbreads, truffles, morels, arti- 
choke-bottoms, and stew them all together in some good gravy, 
which pour over the beef. Have ready forcemeat balls fried, 
made in different shapes ; dip some sippets into butter, fry 
and cut them three-comer- ways, stick them into the meat; lay 
the balls round the dish. 

Beef, to stew. 
Take a pound and a half of the fat part of a brisket, with 
four pounds of stewing beef, cut into pieces ; put these into a 
stewpan, with a little salt, pepper, a bunch of sweet-herbs and 
onions, stuck with cloves, two or three pieces of carrots, two 
quarts of water, and half a pint of good small beer. Let the 
whole stew for four hours ; then take some turnips and carrots 
cut into pieces, a small leek, two or three heads of celery, cut 
small, and a piece of bread toasted hard. Let these stew all 
together one hour longer ; then put the whole into a terrine, 
and serve up. 

Another way. 
Put three pounds of the thin part of the brisket of beef and 
half a pound of gravy beef in a stewpan, with two quarts of 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 97 

water, a little thyme, maijoram, parsley, whole pepper and 
salt, a sufficient quantity, and an onion ; let it stew six hours 
or more ; then add carrots, turnips, (cut with a machine) and 
celery cut small, which have all been previously boiled ; let the 
vegetables be stewed with the beef one hour. Just before you 
take it off the fire, put in some boiled cabbage chopped small, 
some pickled cucumbers and walnuts sliced, some cucumber 
liquor, and a little walnut liquor. Thicken the sauce with a 
lump of butter rolled in flour. Strew the cut vegetables over 
the top of the meat. 

Cold Beef, to dress. 
Slice it as thin as possible ; slice, also, an onion or shalot ; 
squeeze on it the juice of a lemon or two ; then beat it between 
two plates, as you do cucumbers. When it is very well beaten, 
and tastes sharp of the lemon, put it into the dish, in which 
it is to be served ; pick out the onion, and strew over it some 
fine shred parsley and fine bread crumbs ; then pour on it oil 
and mustard well mixed ; garnish with sliced lemon. 

Cold Boiled Beef, to dress. 

When your rump or brisket of beef has been well boiled in 
plain water, about an hour before you serve it up take it out 
of the water, and put it in a pot just large enough to contain 
it. There let it stew, with a little of its own liquor, salt, basil, 
and laurel ; and, having di:ained, put it into the dish on which 
it is to be served for table, and pour over it a sauce, which you 
must have previously ready, made with gravy, salt, whole pepper, 
and a dash of vinegar, thickened over the stove with the yolks 
of three eggs or more, according to the size of the beef and 
the quantity of sauce wanted. Then cover beef and all with 
finely grated bread ; baste it with butter, and brown it with 
a salamander. 

Cold Beef, to pot^ 

Cut the beef small ; add to it some melted butter, two an- 
chovies well washed and boned, a little Jamiaca pepper beat 
very fine. Beat them well together in a marble mortar till the 
meat is yellow ; then put it into pots, and cover it with clari- 
fied butter. 

Beef Steaks to broil. 

When your steak is nearly broiled, chop some large onions, 
as fine as possible, and cover the steak thickly with it, the last 
time you turn it, letting it broil till fit to send to table, when 
the onion should quite cover the steak. Pour good gravy in 
the dish to moisten it^ 



98 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

Beef Steaks and Oysters, 
Put two dozen oysters into a stewpan with their own liquor; 
when it boils add a spoonful of water ; when the oysters are 
done drain them in a sieve, and let the liquor settle ; then pour 
it off clear into another vessel ; beard them, and add a pint of 
jelly gravy to the liquor ; add a piece of butter and two spoon- 
fuls of flour to thicken it. Let this boil fifteen minutes ; then 
throw in the oysters, and let it stand. Take a beef-steak, pare 
it neatly round, and dress it as usual ; when done, lay it on a 
hot dish, and pour the sauce and oysters over it. 

Rump Steaks broiled, with Onion Gravy, 
Peel and slice two large onions ; put them into a stewpan 
with two table-spoonfuls of water ; set it on a slow fire till the 
water is boiled away and the onions have become a little brown. 
Add half a pint of good broth ; boil the onions till tender ; 
strain the broth from them, and chop them fine ; thicken with 
flour and butter, and season with mushroom ketchup, pepper, 
and salt; put the onions in, and boil it gently for five minutes : 
pour the gravy over a broiled rump-steak. 

Beef Steaks, to stew. 
Pepper and salt two fine rump steaks ; lay them in a stewpan 
with a few cloves, some mace, an onion, one anchovy, a bun- 
dle of sweet herbs, a gill of white wine, and a little butter 
mixed with flour; cover them close, stew them very gently till 
they are tender, and shake the pan round often to keep them 
from sticking. Take them careftilly out, flour and fry tliem of 
a nice brown in fresh butter, and put them in a dish. In the 
mean time strain off the gravy from the fat out of the frying- 
pan, and put it in the sauce, with a dozen oysters blanched, and 
a little of the oyster liquor ; give it a boil up, pour it over the 
steaks, and garnish with horseradish. You may fry them 
first and then stew them ; put them in a dish, and strain the 
sauce over them without any oysters, as a common dish. 

Another way. 
Beat three pounds of rump steaks ; put them in a stewpan, 
with a pint of water, the same quantit}' of small beer, six 
cloves, a large onion, a bunch of sweet-herbs, a carrot, a tur- 
nip, pepper, and salt. Stew this very gently, closely covered, 
for four or five hours ; but take care the meat does not go to 
rags, by being done too fast. Take up the meat, and strain the 
gravy over it. Have turnips cut into balls, and carrots into 
shapes, and put them over the meat. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 99 

Beef Olives. 
Take a rump of beef, cut into steaks, about five inches long 
and not half an inch thick. Lay on some good forcemeat, 
made with veal ; roll them, ^dtie them round once or twice, 
to keep them in a neat shape. Mix some crumbs of bread, 
egg, a little grated nutmeg, pepper and salt ; fry them brown; 
have ready some good gravy, with a few truffles, morels, 
and mushrooms, boiled together. Pour it into the dish and 
send them to table, after taking off the string that tied them 
in shape. 

Another way. 
Cut steaks from the inside of the sirloin, about an inch thick, 
six inches long, and four or five broad: beat and rub them 
over with yolk of egg; strew on bread crumbs, parsley chopped, 
lemon-peel shred, pepper and salt, and chopped suet. Roll them 
up tight, skewer them ; fry or brown them in a Dutch oven ; 
stew them in some beef broth or gravy until tender. Thicken 
the gravy with a little flour ; add ketcheup, and a little lemon 
juice, and, to enrich it, add pickled mushrooms, hard yolks of 
eggs, and forcemeat balls. 

Pickle for Beef, 
To four gallons of water put a sufficient quantity of common 
salt ; when quite dissolved, to bear an egg, four ounces of salt- 
petre, two ounces of bay salt, and half a pound of coarse sugar. 
Boil this pickle for twenty minutes, skim it well, and strain it. 
When quite cold, put in your beef, which should be quite covered 
with the pickle, and in nine days it will be fit for use ; or you 
may keep it three months, and it will not be too salt. The 
pickle must be boiled and well skimmed at the end of six weeks, 
and every month afterwards ; it will then keep-three months 
in summer and much longer in winter. 

Beef, to salt. 

Into four gallons of water put one pound and a half of coarse 
brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and six pounds of bay salt ; 
boil and skim as long as any scum rises. When cold, put in 
the meat, which must be quite covered with pickle : once in 
two months boil up the pickle again, skimming carefully. Add 
in the boiling two ounces of coarse sugar, half a poimd of bay 
salt, and the same pickle will be good for twelve months. It is 
incomparable for hung beef, hams, or neats' tongues. When 
you take them out of this pickle, clean, dry, and put them in 
a paper bag, and hang them up in a dry place. 

Pork may be pickled in the same manner.

100 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

Beefi to salt. 
Eight poiincUi of salt, six ounces of saltpetre, one pound and 
a half of brown sugar, four gallons of water ; boil all together, 
skim and put on the beef when cold ; the beef to be kept under 
the pickle with a weight. 

Beef, to dry. 
Salt it in the same way as your hams ; keep it in your pickle 
a fortnight or three weeks, according to its size ; hang it up to 
dry for a few days; then have it smoked the same as hams. 

Hung Beef. No. 1 . 
Take a round, ribs, rump, or sirloin ; let it lie in common 
salt for a month, and well cover it with the brine. Rub a little 
saltpetre over it two or three days before it is hung up ; obser- 
ving, before it is put up to dry, to strew it over with bran or 
oatmeal, to keep it from the dust ; or, which wiU answer the 
same purpose, wrap it up in strong coarse paper. It is not to 
be smoked ; only hang it up in the kitchen, and not too near 
the fire. TTie time of hanging to dry must be regulated by the 
quantity of air in which it is suspended, or left to the discre- 
tion of the person who has the care of it. The time which it 
must lie in water before dressing depends upon the driness of 
the meat. Half boil it in simmering water, and afterwards 
roast. It must not be cut till cold. 

Hung Beef. No. 2. 

Take the under-cliff of a small buttock of beef, two ounces 
of common salt, and one ounce of saltpetre, well beaten toge- 
ther : put to it half a pint of vinegar with a sprig of thyme. 
Rub the beef with this pickle every morning for six days, and 
let it lie in it. Then dry it well with a cloth, and hang it up 
in the chimney for a fortnight. It must be made perfectly dry 
before it will be fit for eating ; it should also be kept in a diy 
place. 

Hung Beef. No. 3. 

Take the tenderest part of beef, and let it hang in the cellar 
as long as you can, taking care that it is not in the least tainted. 
Take it down, wash it well in sugar and water. Dry six- 
pennyworth of saltpetre and two pounds of bay salt, and pound 
them fine; mix wifli it three large spoonfuls of brown sugar; 
rub your beef thoroughly with it. Tike conmion salt, sufficient 
according to the size of the beef to salt it ; let it lie closely 
covered up imtil the salts are entirely dissolved, which will be 
in seven or eight days. Turn it every day, the under part up- 
permost, and so on for a fortnight ; tiien hang it where it may 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 101 

have a little warmth of the fire. It may hang in the kitchen 
a fortnight. When you use it, boil it in hay and pump water 
very tender : it will keep boiled two or three montiis, rubbing 
it with a greasy cloth, or putting it for two or three minutes 
into boiling water to take off any mouldiness. 

Beef for scraping. 

To four pounds of lean buttock of beef take one ounce of 
saltpetre and some common salt, in which let the meat lie for 
a month ; then hang it to dry for three weeks. Boil it for gra- 
ting when wanted. 

Italian Beef 

Take a round of beef, about fifteen or eighteen pounds ; rub 
it well with three ounces of saltpetre, and let it lie for four 
hours in it. Then season it very well with beaten mace, pep- 
per, cloves, and salt sufficient ; let it then lie in that seasoning 
for twelve days ; wash it well, and put it in the pot in which 
you intend to bake it, with one pound of suet slu'ed fine, and 
thrown under and over it. Cover your pot and paste it down : 
let it stew six hours in its own liquor, and eat it cold. 

Red Beef 

Twelve pounds of ribs of beef boned, four ounces of bay salt, 
three ounces of saltpetre ; beat them fine, and mix with half a 
pound of coarse sugar, two poimds of common salt, and a hand- 
ful of juniper berries bruised. Rub the beef well with this 
mixture, and turn it every day about three weeks or a month ; 
bake it in a coarse paste. 

Another way. 

Take a piece of brisket of beef, about sixteen or eighteen 
pounds ; make the pickle for it as follows : — saltpetre and bay 
salt, one pound and a half of each, one pound of coarse brown 
sugar, and six pounds of common salt ; add to these three gal- 
lons of water. Set it on the fire and keep it stirring, lest the 
salts should bum ; as it boils skim it well till clear : boil it 
about an hour and a half. When it is quite cold, put in the 
beef, and let it lie in a pan that will hold it properly ; turn it 
every day, and let it remain in about a fortnight. Take it out, 
and just wash it in clean water, and put it into the pot in which 
you stew it with some weak broth ; then add slices of fat bacon, 
fat of veal, any pieces of fat meat, the more fat the better, 
especially of veal, also a pint of brandy, a full pint of wine, a 
handful of bay-leaves, a few cloves, and some blades of mace, 
about two large carrots, one dozen of large onions, a good bundle 
of sweet-herbs, some parsley, and two or three turnips. Stew 



102 MEATS Mfft^ VEGETABLES. 

it exceedingly gently for eight hours. The broth should cover 
the meat while it is stewing, and keep the slices of fat as much 
over it as you can ; the seldomer you uncover the pot the bet- 
ter. When you think it sufficiently tender, which try with your 
finger, take it off, and, though it may appear tender enough to 
fall to pieces, it will harden sufficiently when it grows cold. It 
should remain in the pot just as it is taken off the fire till it is 
very nearly if not quite cold. It will eat much better for being 
so left, and you will also not run the risk of breaking the beef 
in pieces, as you would by removing it whilst hot. 

Collar of Beef, 
Bone the navel and navel round ; make sufficient pickle to 
cover it, as strong as to bear an egg, with bay salt ; beat two 
ounces of saltpetre very fine, and strew half of it on your 
beef before you lay it in your pickle. Then lay it in an earthen 
pan, and press it down in the liquor with a weight, as it must 
be all covered. Let it remain thus for four or five days, 
stirring it however once every day. Take it out, let the brine 
drain from it, lay it on a table, and season it with nutmeg, - 
pepper, cloves, and mace, some parsley, thjone, and sweet mar- 
joram, of each a little, and eight anchovies sliced ; roll it up 
with these like brawn, and bind it quite fast with strong tape. 
Then put it into a pan, deep enough for it to stand upright; 
fill the pan with water, and cover it with paste. Make your 
oven very hot, put it in, and let it remain there five or six hours ; 
then take it out, and, having removed the tape, roll it in a cloth ; 
hang it up till cold. If you think it not salt enough, before you 
bake it, put a little salt with your spice and herbs, for baking 
in water abates much of its saltness. 

Another, 
Salt a flank of beef with white salt, and let it lie for forty- 
eight hours. Wash it, and hang it in the wind to dry for twenty- 
four hours. Then take pepper, salt, cloves, saltpetre, all 
beaten fine, and mix them together ; rub the beef all over ; roll 
it up hard, and tie it fast with tape. Put it in a pan, with a 
few bay-leaves, and four pounds of butter. Cover the pot 
with rye paste, and bake it with household bread. 

Bisquet, to make. 

Cut some slips of white paper ; butter and place them at the 

bottom and sides of the pan you make your bisquet in ; then 

cut thin collops of veal, or whatever meat you make it of; lay 

them on the paper, and cover them with forcemeat. Put in 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 103 

anything else you like, carrots, &c; close the top with force- 
meat and veal, and paper again ; put it in the oven or stove, 
and, when done, and you want to dish it, turn the pan upside 
down from the dish ; take the paper off, and pour good gravy 
on it. 

Boar's Head, to dress whole. 
When the head is cut off, the neck part must be boned, and 
the tongue taken out. The brains also must be taken out on 
the inside, so as not to break the bone and skin on the out- 
side. When boned, singe the hair off, and clean it ; then put 
it for four or five days into a red pickle made of saltpetre, 
bay salt, common salt, and coarse brown sugar, rubbing the 
pickle in every day. When taken out of the pickle, lay the 
tongue in the centre of the neck or collar ; close the meat to- 
gether as close as you can, and bind it with strong tape up to 
the ears, the same as you would do brawn ; then put it into a pot 
or kettle, the neck downward, and fill the pot with good broth 
and Rhenish wine, in the proportion of one bottle of wine to 
three pints of broth, till it is covered a little above the ears. 
Season the wine and broth with small bunches of sweet-herbs, 
such as basil, winter savory, and marjoram, bay-leaves, shalots, 
celery, carrots, turnips, parsley-roots, with different kinds of 
spices. Set it over the fire to boil ; when it boils, put it on one 
side to boil gently, till the head is tender. Take it out of the 
liquor, and put it into an earthen pan ; skim all the fat off the 
liquor ; strain it through a sieve into the head ; put it by until 
it is quite cold, and then it will be fit for use. 

Brawn, to keep. 

Put some bran and three handfuls of salt into a kettle of 
water ; boil and strain it through a sieve, and, when cold, put 
your brawn into it. 

Hog's head like Brawn. 

Wash it well ; boil it till the bones will come out ; when 
cold, put the inside of the cheek together with salt between ; 
put the ears round the sides. Put the cheeks into a cloth, press 
them into a sieve, or anything round ; lay on a weight for two 
days. Have ready a pickle of salt and water, with about a 
pint of malt, boiled together ; when cold, put in the head. 

Mock Brawn. 

Take two pair of neats* feet ; boil them very tender, and take 

the flesh clean from the bones. Boil the belly piece of pork 

till nearly done, then bone it, and roll the meat of the feet up 

very tight in the pork. Take a strong cloth, with some coarse 



104 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

tape ; roll it round very tight ; tie it up in the cloth ; boil it till 
it is 80 tender that a skewer may go through it ; let it be hung 
in a cloth till it is quite cold ; after which put it into some 
sousing liquor, and keep it for use. 

Cabbage, farced. 
Take a fine white-heart cabbage, about as big as a quarter of 
a peck, lay it in water two or three hours, half boil it, put it 
in a colander to drain, then cut out the heart, but take very great 
care not to break off any of the outside leaves. Fill it with 
forcemeat made thus : — take a pound of veal, half a pound of 
bacon, fat and lean together ; cut them small, and beat them 
fine in a mortar, with the yolks of four eggs boiled hard ; 
season with pepper and salt, a little beaten mace, a very little 
lemon-peel, some parsley chopped fine, a very little thyme, and 
three anchovies. When these are beat fine, take the crumb of 
a stale roll, some mushrooms, either fresh or pickled, and the 
heart of the cabbage which you cut out. Chop it very fine; 
mix all together with the yolk of an egg ; fill the hoUow of 
the cabbage, and tie it round with thread. Lay some sHces of 
bacon in the bottom of a stewpan, and upon these some thin 
slices of coarse beef, about one pound : put in the cabbage, cover 
it close, and let it stew gently over a slow fire, until the bacon 
begins to stick to the bottom of the pan. Shake in a little flour ; 
then put in a quart of good broth, an onion stuck with cloves, 
two blades of mace, some whole pepper, a little bundle of sweet- 
herbs ; cover close, and let it stew gently an hour and a half. 
Put in a glass of red wine, give it a boil, and take it up ; lay 
it in a dish, and strain the gravy over it, untying the packthread 
first. This is a very good dish, and makes the next day an ex- 
cellent hash, with a veal steak nicely boiled and laid on it. 

Calfs Head. 
Scald the hair off; trim and pare it, and make it look as neat 
as possible. Take out the bones, and have ready palates boiled 
tender, hard-boiled yolks of eggs, oysters just scalded, and very 
good forcemeat : stuff all this into the head, and sew it close 
in a cloth. Boil it gently for fuU three hours. Make a strong 
good gravy for sauce. Garnish with fried bacon. 

Calfs Head, to dress like Turtle. 

The wool must be scalded off in the same manner as the hair 

is taken off a little pig, which may be done at the butcher's ; 

then wash and parboil it ; cut the meat from the bones, and 

put it in a saucepan, with as much of the broth as will just 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 105 

cover it. Put in half a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper, and 
some common pepper and salt, a large onion, and a faggot of 
sweet-herbs ; take out the herbs and the onion before it breaks. 
About half an hour before it is done, put three quarters of a pint 
of white or raisin wine; have ready the yolks of six or eight eggs 
boiled hard, which you must make into small balls, and put 
in just before you serve it up. It will take two hours and a 
half, or perhaps three hours doing, over a slow fire. 

Valfs Head, to hash. No. 1. 
Let the calf's head be washed clean, and boiled tender ; then 
cut the meat off one half of the head in small slices. To make 
the sauce, take some parsley, thyme, and a very little onion, 
let them be chopped fine ; then pciss them in a stewpan over 
the fire, with some butter, till tender. Add some flour, a very 
little pepper and salt, and some good strong broth, according to 
your quantity of meat ; let it boil, then skim it, put the meat 
into it, and add a little lemon-juice and a little white wine ; 
let all boil together about ten minutes. There may be some 
force-meat balls added, if liked. The other half of the head 
must be scored like diamonds, cross and across ; then rub it 
with some oiled butter and yolk of egg ; mix some chopped 
parsley and thyme, pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, and some 
bread crumbs; strew tiie head all over with this; broil it a 
nice light brown, and put it on the hash when dished. Scald 
the brains, and cut them in four pieces ; rub them with yolk of 
egg, then let them be crumbed, with the same crumbs and 
herbs as the head was done with, and ^ed a light brown ; lay 
them round the dish with a few slices of bacon or ham ^ied. 
The brains may be done, to be sent up alone on a plate, as 
follows : — Let the brains be washed and skinned ; let them be 
boiled in broth, about twenty-five minutes ; make a little 
white sauce of some butter, flour, salt, a little cream, and a 
little good broth ; let it just boil ; then pick a little green sage, 
a little parsley picked very small, and scalded till tender ; the 
brains, parsley, and sage, must be strained off, and put into 
the white sauce, and let it come to a boil, just before you put 
them on the dish to send up. 

Calf's Head, to hash. No. 2. 
Take half a calf's head, cover it with water in a large sauce- 
pan, and boil it till the meat comes from the bone. Cut it into 
pieces ; put it into some of the liquor in which the head was 
boiled, and let it stew till it becomes thick. Add a little salt 
and mace, and put it into a mould.

Your calf's head being half boiled and cooled, cut it in 
thin slices, and fry it in a pan of brown butter ; put it into 
your tossing pan with gravy ; stew it till tender ; toss it up 
with burnt butter, or butter rolled in flour. Garnish with force* 
meat balls, and fritters, made of the brains, mixed up with eggs, 
a little cream, a dust of flour, nutmeg, and a little parsley, 
boiled and chopped fine. Mix them all well together, and fry 
them in little cakes ; put a few bits of bacon and lemon round 
the dish.

Calf's Head, to hash. No. 5. 

Have the head well cleaned ; boil it well, cut in slices half 
of the head, and have some good ragout of forcemeat, truffles, 
mushrooms, morels, and artichoke bottoms, also some veal 
sweet-herbs. Season your ragout, and throw in your slices, a 
bit of garlic and parsley, with some thyme, and squeeze a lemon 
in it, but be cautious to have it skimmed well. Take the other 
part of the head, and score it like diamonds ; season with salt 
and pepper, and rub it over with an egg and some crumbs of 
bread. Then broil it, pour the hash into the dish; let the 
half head lie in the middle, and cut and set off the brains after- 
wards in slices. Fry bacon, and lay slices round the dish with 
sliced lemon. 

Calf's He ad fricassee. 

Clean well a calf s head, boil it and cut in square pieces of 
about an inch ; put half a pint of its own liquor, and mix it well 
with some mushrooms, sweetbreads, yolks of eggs, artichoke 
bottoms, and cream. Season with nutmeg and mace, and 
squeeze in a lemon : but serve it up hot. 

Calfs Head, to pickle. 
Take out the bones and clean the head carefully : wash it 
well with eggs, seasoning it with pepper, salt, nutmeg, thyme, 
and parsley. Put some forcemeat on it, and roll it up. Boil it

tender ; take it up, lay it in sturgeon-pickle for four days ; and 
if you please you may cut it in pieces as you would sturgeon. 

Calf's Liver. 
Lay it for a few hours in milk, then dry and fry it in butter. 

Cauliflowers, with White Sauce, 
Boil the cauliflowers in small pieces till tender ; drain them 
in a sieve ; when quite dry lay them in a dish ; season the sauce 
with a little pepper and salt, and pour it pretty thick over them. 

Celery, to stew. 
Cut and trim a dozen heads of celery; put them in cold 
water to blanch ; stew them in a little butter, salt, and water. 
When done enough they should be quite soft, but not broken. 
Drain them, and have ready a rich white sauce, the same that 
is used for boiled chickens, only without truffles or mushrooms ; 
pour this sauce over the celery, and serve hot. 

Another way. 
Take a dozen white heads of celery, cut about two inches 
long, wash them clean, and put them in a stewpan, with a pint 
of gravy, a glass of white wine, a bundle of sweet-herbs, pep- 
per, and salt : cover close, and stew them till they are tender. 
Then take out the sweet-herbs ; put in a piece of butter mixed 
with flour ; let it stew till it is thick, and dish it up. 

Celery d la Cr^ne. 

Take a dozen white heads of celery, cut about two inches 
long ; wash them very clean, and boil them in water till they 
are very tender ; have ready half a pint of cream, a little butter 
mixed with flour, a little nutmeg, and salt ; boil it up till thick 
and smooth ; put in the celery, give it a toss or two, and dish 
it up. 

Scotch Collops. 

Take a piece of the fillet of veal, as much as will cut into 
fifteen pieces, of the size and thickness of a crown-piece; 
shake a little flour over it; put a little butter into a frying-pan, 
and melt it ; fry the slices of veal quick till they are brown, 
and lay them in a dish near the fire. Then prepare a sauce 
thus: take a little butter in a stewpan and melt it ; add a table- 
spoonful of flour ; stir it about till it is as smooth as cream ; 
put in half a pint each of beef and veal jelly, cayenne pepper and 
salt, a pinch of each, and one glass of white wine, twenty-four 
pieces of truffles the size of a shilling, and a table-spoonful of 



108 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

moshrooms : wash them thoroughly from vinegar ; squeeze tlie 
juice of half a lemon ; stew the sauce gently for one hour; then 
throw in the veal, and stew it all together for five minutes. 
Serve quite hot, laying the veal regularly in the dish. 

Another way. 

Cut the lean part of a leg of veal into thin collops ; beat 
them with the back of a kn^e ; season with pepper and salt, 
shred thyme and parsley, and flour them well. Resa-ve some 
of the meat to make balls. Taking as much suet as meat, shred 
it small; thenbeatit in a mortar ; season with pepper, salt, shred 
herbs, a little shred onion, and a little allspice. Put in an egg or 
two, according to the quantity. Make balls, and fry them in good 
dripping ; keep them warm. Then fry your collops with cla- 
rified butter, till they are brown enough ; and, while they are 
warming in the pan, put in your sauce, which must be made 
thus : — ^have some good glaze, a little white wine, a good piece 
of butter, and two yolks of eggs. Put your balls to the collops ; 
flour and make them very hot in the pan ; put in your sauce, 
shake them well, and let them boil. If you would have them 
white, put strong broth instead of glaze and half a pint of 
cream. 

Scotch Collops, brown. 

Cut your collops thin and from the fillet. Season them with 
salt and pepper, and fry them off quick and brown. Brown a 
piece of butter thickened with flour, and put in some good 
-gravy, mushrooms, morels, trufiies, and forcemeat balls, with 
sweetbread dried. Squeeze in a lemon, and let the whole boil 
tin of a proper thickness. Then put in your collops, but da 
not let them boil ; toss them up quick, and serve up. 

Collops, White, No. 1. 
Take a small slice of veal, cut thin slices from it, and beat 
them out very thin : butter a frjring-pan very lightly, place them 
in it, and pass them on the fire, but not to get any colour. Trim 
them round, and put them into white sauce. 

Collops, White. No. 2. 
Cut the veal very thin; put it into a stewpan with a piece of 
butter and one clove of shalot ; toss it in a pan for a few mi- 
nutes. Have ready to put to it some cream, more or less ac- 
cording to the quantity of veal, a piece of butter mixed with 
flour, the yolk of an egg, a little nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful 
of lemon-pickle. Stir it over the fire till it is thick enough, 
but do not let it boil. If you choose forcemeat balls, have 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 109 

them ready boiled in water, and take out the shalot before yon 
dish up : ten minutes will do them. 

Collops, White, No. 3. 
Hack and cut your collops well ; season with pepper and salt, 
and fry them quick of a pale colour in a little bit of butter. 
Squeeze in a lemon : put in half a pint of cream and the yolks 
of four eggs. Toss them up quick, and serve them hot. 

Collops, to mince. 
Chop some beef as fine as possible ; the under part of roasted 
beef without any fat is best. Put some onions, pepper, and 
salt to it. Then put a little butter in the frying-pan ; when 
it is melted, put in the meat, and stew it well. Add a cupful 
of gravy ; if you have none, water will do. Just before it is 
done put in a little vinegar. 

Collops of cold beef. 
Take off all the fat from the inside of a sirloin of beef; cut 
it neatly into thin collops, about the size of a crown or half- 
crown piece, as you like for size, and cut them round. Slice 
an onion very small ; boil the gravy that came from the beef 
when roasted, first clearing it of all the fat, with a little water ; 
season it with pepper, and, instead of salt, anchovies dissolved 
in walnut ketchup, or the liquor from pickled walnuts, and a 
bundle of sweet-herbs. Let this boil before you put in the col- 
lops ; put them in with a good piece of butter rolled in a little 
flour ; shake it roimd to thicken it, and let it do no longer than 
till the collops are thoroughly heated, lest they be hard. This 
does better than fresh meat. Serve it hot with pickles, or 
slices of stewed cucumbers, cut round, like the meat, and placed 
alternately with it round the dish. . 

Cucumbers, to stew. 
Pare twelve cucumbers, and slice them rather thicker than 
for eating ; put them to drain, and lay them in a coarse cloth 
till dry. Flour and fry them brown in butter ; then put to 
them some gravy, a litlfe claret, some pepper, cloves, and 
mace ; let them stew a little ; then roll a bit of butter in flour, 
and toss them up. A sufficient quantity of onion should be 
sliced thin, and done like the cucumbers. 

Curry Powder, from a Resident in India. No. 1. 
Half a pound of coriander seed, two ounces of black pepper, 
two ounces of cummin seed, one ounce of turmeric, one ounce 



110 MEATS AND VEGETABLES, 

and half of ground rice : all the above must be finely pounded; 
add cayenne to your taste. Mix all well together ; put it into 
a dish close before the fire ; roast it well for three or four 
hours ; and, when quite cold, put it into a bottle for use. 

Curry Powder. No. 2. 

Thirteen ounces of coriander seed,* two ounces of fenugreek 
seed,* (if not liked this may be omitted,) one ounce of cayenne 
pepper, or powdered capsicums, six ounces of pale-coloured 
turmeric,* five ounces of black pepper. Pound the whole very 
fine ; set it in a Dutch oven before the fire to dry, turning it 
often ; when cold put it into a dry bottle ; cork, and keep it in 
a dry place. So prepared, curry-powder will keep for many 
years. 

The ingredients marked thus * may be procured at Apothe- 
caries' HaU, or at any wholesale chemist's. 

Curry Powder. No. 3. 
One pound of turmeric, one pound of coriander seed, one 
pound of ginger, six ounces of cardamom, four ounces of cum- 
min, one ounce of long pepper, pounded and mixed together. 
Cayenne pepper may also be added. 

Curry, Indian. No. I. 

Curry may be made of chicken, rabbits, lobster, or of any 
species of fish, flesh, or fowl. Fry the material with onions, 
as for mulligatawny, a small piece of garlic, eight almonds, and 
eight sweet chesnuts. Put it all into a stewpan, with a spoon- 
ful or two of curry-powder, a large tea-cupful of strong good 
gravy, and a, large piece of butter. Let the whole stew gently 
till the gravy becomes very thick and is nearly evaporated. 

Particular attention should be paid in sending tiiis dish up 
hot, and always with plenty of rice in a separate dish ; most 
people like pickle with it. 

Curry. No, 2. 
Chop one or two onions very fine ; put them into a stewpan 
with some butter, and let them reflg||n on a slow fire till tiiey 
are well done, taking care not to leOhem bum. Pour off the 
butter : put in one dessert spoonful of powder and a little gravy ; 
stir it about till it is well mixed ; set it on a slow fire till it is all 
sufficiently done. Put in a little lemon-juice; when nearly 
done, thicken the gravy with flour. Let the rice be very weU 
picked and afterwards cleansed ; it ought to be washed in several 
waters, and kept in water till it is going to be boiled. Have 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. Ill 

the meat or fish ready, put it into the stewpan, and stir it about 
till it is well mixed. The rice must be boiled twenty minutes 
quickly, and the scum taken off; the water to be thrown off 
and the saucepan uncovered till it is dry enough. Meat used 
for this curry must be previously fried. 

Curry. No. 3. 

Fry onions, ginger, garlic, and meat, in one ounce of butter, 
of a light brown ; stew it with a table-spoonful of curry-powder 
and three pints of water, till it comes to a pint and a half. A 
good half hour before dinner, put in greens, such as brocoli, 
cauliflower, sliced apple, and mango, the juice of one lemon, 
grated ginger, and cayenne, with two spoonfuls of cream, and 
a little flour to thicken it. 

Curry. No. 4. 

Skin and prepare two chickens as for a fricassee ; wash them 
very clean, and stew them in a pint and a half of water for about 
five minutes. Strain off the hquor, and put the chickens in a 
dean dish. Slice three large onions, and fry them in about two 
ounces of butter. Put in the chickens, and fry them together 
till they are brown. Take a quarter of an ounce of curry-pow- 
der, and salt to your palate, and strew over the chickens while 
they are frying ; then pour in the liquor in which they were 
first stewed, and let them stew again for half an hour. Add a 
quarter of a pint of cream and the juice of two lemons. Have 
rice boiled dry to eat with it. Rabbits do as well as chickens. 

Curry, No. 5. 
Take two chickens, or in the same proportion of any oHier 
kind of flesh, fish, or fowl ; cut the meat small; strew a little 
salt and pepper over it ; add a small quantity of onion fried in 
butter; put one table -spoonful of curry-powder to your meat 
and onions; mix them well together with about three quarters 
of a pint of water. Put the whole in a stewpan covered close ; 
let it stew half an hour before you open the pan ; then add the 
juice of two lemons, or an equal quantity of any other sour- 
ing. Let it stew again till the gravy appears very thick and 
adheres to the meat. If^j^meat floats in the gravy, the curry 
will not be considered aswell made. Salt to your palate. 

Curry. No. 6. 
Mix together a quart of good gravy, two spoonfuls of curry- 
powder, two of soy, a gill of red wine, a little cayenne pepper, 
and the juice of a lemon. Cut a breast of veal in square pieces, 
and put it in a stewpan with a pint of gravy ; stew slowly for a 



112 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

quarter of an hour ; add the rest of the gravy with the ingre- 
dients, and Btew till done. 

Curry. No. 7. 
Take a fowl, fish, or any meat you like ; cut it in slices ; cut 
up two good sized onions very fine ; half fry your fowl, or 
meat, with the onions, in a quarter of a pound of butter. Add 
two table-spoonfuls of curry-powder, fry it a little longer, and 
stew it well ; then add any acid you like, a little salt, and half 
a pint of water. Let all stew together until the meat is done. 

Farcie, to make. 

Take the tender part of a fillet of veal, free from sinew, 
and mince it fine, with a piece of the fat of ham, some chopped 
thyme, basil, and marjoram, dried, and a little seasoning accord- 
ing to the palate. Put the whole in a stewpan, and keep stir- 
ring it till it is warm through ; then put it on a sieve to drain. 
When the liquor has run from it, pound the farcie, while warm, 
in a mortar, adding the drained liquor, by degrees, till the 
whole is again absorbed in the meat, which must be pounded 
very fine. Put it in an earthen pot, and steam it for half an 
hour with a slice of fat ham ; cover over the pot to prevent the 
steam from getting to it ; when cold, pour on some good jelly 
made of the lean of ham and veal, and take care to pour it 
on cold (that is, when the jelly is just dissolved,) otherwise it 
will raise the farcie. When livers are to be had, put a third 
of them with the ham and veal, as above directed, and the 
farcie will be better. 

Forcemeat, to make. No. 1. 

Chop small a pound of veal, parsley, thyme, a small onion, 
and a pound of beef ; grate the inside of three French rolls, 
and put all these together, with pepper, salt, soup, and nut- 
meg, seasoning it to your taste ; add as many eggs as will 
me^e it of a proper stiffness, and roll them into bsdls. 

Forcemeat. No. 2. 
Take half a pound of the lean of a leg of veal, with the skin 
picked off", cut it into small pieces, and mince it very small; 
shred very fine a pound of beef-su^plmd grate a nutmeg into 
both ; beat half as much mace intoW with cloves, pepper, and 
salt, a little rosemary, thyme, sweet marjoram, and winter 
savory. Put all these to the meat in a mortar, and beat all 
together, till it is smooth and will work easily with your hands, 
like paste. Break two new laid eggs to some white bread 
crumbs, and make them into a paste with your hands, frying it 
in butter. If you choose, leave out the herbs. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 113 

Forcemeat. No. 3. 

A pound of veal, full its weight in beef suet, and a bit of 
bacon, shred all together ; beat it in a mortar very fine ; season 
with sweet-herbs, pepper, and salt. When you roll it up to 
fry, add the yolks of two or three eggs to bind it ; you may add 
oysters or marrow. 

Fricandeau. 

Take a piece of veal next to the udder ; separate the skin, and 
flatten the meat on a clean cloth ; make slits in the bottom part, 
that it may soak up seasoning, and lard the top very thick and 
even. Take a stewpan that will receive the veal without con- 
fining it ; put at the bottom three carrots cut in slices, two 
large onions sliced, a bunch of parsley, the roots cut small, a 
little mace, pepper, thyme, and a bay-leaf; then lay some 
slices of very fat bacon, so as entirely to cover the vegetables, 
and make a pile of bacon in the shape of a tea-cup. Lay the 
veal over this bacon ; powder a little salt over it ; then put suf- 
ficient broth, and some beef jelly, lowered with warm water, to 
cover the bottom of the stewpan without reaching the veal. 
Lay a quantity of fine charcosd hot on the cover of the pan, 
keeping a very little fire beneath ; as soon as it begins to boil, 
remove the stewpan, and place it over a very slow and equal 
fire for three hours and a half, removing the fire from the top ; 
baste it frequently with liquor. When it has stewed the pro- 
per time, try if it is done by putting in a skewer, which will then 
goJn and out easily. Put a great quantity of fire again on the 
top of the stewpan till the bacon of the larding becomes quite 
finn ; next remove the veal, and keep it near the fire ; reduce 
the liquor to deep rich gravy to glaze it, which pour over the 
top only where it is larded ; and, when it is served, put thfe 
fricandeau in a dish, and the pur^ of spinach, which is to be 
ready according to the receipt given in the proper place, (See 
Spinach to stew,) to lay round the dish. 

Ham, to cure. No. 1. . 
Take a ham of young pork ; sprinkle it with salt, and let it 
lie twenty-four hours. Having wiped it very dry, rub it well 
with a poimd of coarse j jy n sugar, a pound of jimiper ber- 
ries, a quarter of a pouncNw saltpetre, half a pint of bay salt, 
and three pints of common salt, mixed together, and dried in 
an iron pot over the fire, stirring them the whole time. After 
this, take it off the fire, when boiled, and let it lie in an earthen 
glazed pan three weeks, but it must be often turned in the 
time, and basted with the brine in which it lies. Then hang 
it up tiU it has done dripping ; and dry it in a chimney with 
deal saw-dust and juniper berries.

Ham, to cure. No. 2. 
For two hams, take half a pound of bay salt, two ounces of 
saltpetre, two ounces of sal prunella, half a pound of brown 
sugar, half a pound of juniper berries, half a pound of common 
salt ; beat them all, and boil them in two qusGi» of strong beer 
for half an hour very gently. Leave out one ounce of salt- 
petre to rub the hams over-night. Put them into the pickle, and 
let them lie a month or five weeks, basting them every day. 
Pickle in the winter, and dry in wood smoke ; let them hang 
up the chimney a fortnight. 

Ham, to cure. No. 3. 
Hang up a ham two days ; beat it well on the fleshy side with 
a rollingpin ; rub in an ounce of saltpetre, finely powdered, and 
let it lie a day. Then mix together an ounce of sal prunella 
with two large handfuls of common salt, one handful of bay 
salt, and a pound of coarse sugar, and make them hot in a 
stewpan. While hot, rub it well in with two handfuls more of 
common salt ; then let it lie till it melts to brine. Turn the 
meat twice every day for three weeks, and dry it like bacon. 

Ham, to cure — the Thorpe way. No. 4. 

The following are the proportions for two hams, or pigs' 
faces : Boil one pound of common salt, three ounces of bay salt, 
two ounces and a half of saltpetre, and one pound of the coarsest 
brown sugar, in a quart of strong old beer. When this pickle 
is cold, well rub the hams or faces with it every day for a fort- 
night. Smoke them with horse litter for two hours ; then hang 
them to dry in a chimney where wood is burned for a fortnight, 
after which, hang them in a dry place till wanted for use. 
They are not so good if used under eight months or after a 
year old. 

Ham, to cure. No. 5. 

For one large ham take one pound of coarse sugar, one pound 
common salt, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, and two ounces 
of bay salt, boiled in a quart of strong ale, or porter. When 
cold put it to your ham ; and let it, lie in the pickle three 
weeks, turning the ham every day^^. 

Ham, to cure. No. 6. 
Put two ounces of sal prunella, a pound of bay salt, four 
pounds of white salt, a pound of brown sugar, half a pound of 
saltpetre, to one gallon of water ; boil it a quarter of an hour, 
keeping, it well skimmed, and, when cold, pour it from the se- 
diment into the vessel in which you steep, and let the hams 
remain in the pickle about a month ; the tongues a fortnight. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 115 

In the same manner Dutch beef may be made by letting it lie 
in the pickle for a month, and eight or ten days for collared 
beef; dry them in a stove or chimney. Tongues may be 
cured in the same manner. 

Ham, to cure. No 7. 
Four gallons of spring water, two pounds of bay salt, half 
a pound of common salt, two pounds of treacle, to be boiled 
a quarter of an hour, skimmed well, and poured hot on the 
hams. Let them be turned in the pickle every day, and remain 
three weeks or a month ; tongues may be cured in the same way. 

Ham, to cure. No. 8. 
One ounce of pepper, two of saltpetre, one pound of bay 
salt, one ounce of sal prunella, one pound of common salt. Rub 
these in well, and let the ham lie a week after rubbing ; then rub 
over it one pound of treacle or coarse sugar. Let it lie three 
weeks longer ; take it up, steep it twenty-four hours in cold 
water, and then hang it up. 

Ham, to cure. No. 9. 
One pound of common salt, half a pound of bay salt, four* 
ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of black pepper ; mix them to- 
gether, and rub the ham very well for four days, until the whole 
is dissolved. Then take one pound and a half of treacle and 
rub on, and let it lie in the pickle one month ; turning it once 
a day. When you dress it, let the water boil before you put it 
in. 

Ham, to cure. No. 10. 
Into four gallons of water put one pound and a half of the 
coarsest sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and six pounds of com- 
mon salt ; boil it, carefully taking off the scum till it has done 
rising ; then let it stand till cold. Having put the meat into 
the vessel in which you intend to keep it, pour on the liquor 
till it is quite covered. If you wish to keep the meat for a 
long time, it will be necessary once in two or three months to 
boil the pickle over again, clearing off the scum as it rises, and 
adding, when boiling, a quarter of a pound of sugar, half a 
pound of salt, and half an ounce of saltpetre ; in this way the 
pickle will keep good for a«year. When you take the meat out 
of the pickle, dry it well berfbre it is smoked. Hams from fif- 
teen to twenty pounds should lie in pickle twenty-four days ; 
small hams and tongues, fifteen days ; a small piece of beef 
about the same time. Hams and beef will not do in the same 
pickle together. After the hams are taken out, the pickle must 
be boiled again before the beef is put in. 

The same process may be used for beef and tongues.

Ham, to cure. No. 11. 

Mix one pound and a half of salt, one pound and a half of 
coarse sugar, and one ounce of saltpetre, in one quart of yrsXer; 
set it on ^e fire, and keep stirring the liquor till it boils. Skim 
it. When boiled about five minutes take it off, and pour it 
boiling hot on the leg of pork, which, if not quite covered, 
must be turned every day. Let it remain in the pickle one 
month ; then hang it in the chimney for six weeks. These 
proportions will cure a ham of sixteen pounds. When the 
ham is taken out of the pickle, the liquor may be boiled up 
again and poured boiling hot upon pigs' faces. After that bofl 
again, and pour it cold upon a piece of beef, which will be excel- 
lent. It will then serve cold for pigs' or sheep's tongues, which 
must be well washed and rubbed in a little of the liquor and 
left in the remainder. 

Ham^ to cure. No. 12. 

Take a ham of fifteen pounds, and wash it well with a quarter 
of a pint of vinegar, mixed with a quarter of a pound of the 
coarsest sugar. Next morning rub it well with three quarters 
of a pound of bay salt rolled, on the lean part ; baste it often 
every day for fourteen days, and hang it up to dry. 

Ham, to cure. No. 13. 
Three ounces of saltpetre, bay salt and brown sugar two 
ounces of each, a small quantity of cochineal ; mix them all 
together, and warm them over the fire. Rub the hams well 
with it, and cover them over with common salt. 

Ham, to cure. No. 14. 
Take a quantity of spring water sufficient to cover the meat 
you design to cure ; make the pickle with an equal quantity of 
bay salt and common salt ; add to a pound of each one pound 
of coarse brown sugar, one ounce of saltpetre, and one ounce of 
petre-salt ; let the pickle be strong enough to bear an egg. If 
you design to eat the pork in a month or six weeks, it is best 
not to boil the pickle ; if you intend it for the year, the pickle 
must be boiled and skimmed well until it is perfectly clear ; let 
it be quite cold before you use it. Rub the meat that is to be 
preserved with some common salt, and let it lie upon a table 
sloping, to drain out all the blood ; wipe it very dry with a 
coarse cloth before you put it into the pickle. The proportion 
of the pickle may be this : four pounds of common salt, four 
pounds of bay salt, three pounds of coarse sugar, two ounces 
of saltpetre, and two ounces of petre-salt, with a sufficient quan- 
tity of spring water to cover what you do, boiled as directed

above. Let the hams lie about six weeks in the pickle, and then 
send them to be smoked. Beef, pork, and tongues, may be 
cured in the same manner : ribs of beef done in this way are 
excellent. 

Ham, to cure. No. 15. 
Wash the ham clean ; soak it in pump water for an hour ; 
dry it well, and rub into it the following composition : salt- 
petre two ounces, bay salt nine ounces, common salt four ounces, 
lump sugar three ounces ; but first beat them separately into a 
fine powder ; mix them together, dry them before the fire, and 
then rub them into the ham, as hot as the hand can bear it. 
Then lay the ham sloping on a table ; put on it a board with forty 
or fifty pounds weight; let it remain thus for five days ; then turn 
it, and, if any of the salt is about it, rub it in, and let it remain 
with the board and weight on it for five days more ; this done rub 
ofiT the salt, &c. When you intend to smoke it, hang the ham 
in a sugar hogshead, over a chaffing-dish of wood embers; throw 
on it a hand^ of juniper-berries, and over that some horse- 
dung, and cover the cask with a blanket. This may be repeated 
two or three times the same day, and the ham may be taken out 
of the hogshead the next morning. The quantity of salt here 
specified is for a middle sized ham. There should not be a hole 
cut in the leg, as is customary, to hang it up by, nor should it 
be soaked in brine. Hams thus cured will keep for three 
months without smoking, so that the whole quantity for the 
year may be smoked at die same time. The ham need not be 
soaked in water before it is used, but only washed clean. Instead 
of a chaffing-dish of coals to smoke the hams, make a hole in 
the groimd, and therein put the fire ; it must not be fierce : be 
sure to keep the mouth of the hogshead covered with a blan- 
ket to retain the smoke. 

Westphalia Ham, io cure. No. 1. 
Cut a leg of pork to the shape of a Westphalia ham ; salt it, 
and set it on the fire in a skillet till dry, and put to it two ounces 
of saltpetre finely beaten. The salt must be put on as hot as 
possible. Let it remain a week in the salt, and then hang it 
up in the chinmey for three weeks or a month. Two ounces 
of saltpetre will be sufficient for the quantity of salt required 
for one ham. 

Westphalia Ham, to cure. No. 2. 
Let the hams be very well pricked with a skewer on the 
wrong side, hanging them in an airy place as long as they 
will keep sweet, and with a gallon of saltpetre make a pickle.

and keep stirring it till it will bear an egg ; boil and skim it 
and put three pounds of brown sugar to it. Let the hams lie 
about a month in this pickle, which must be cold when they 
are put in ; turn them every day ; dry them with saw-dust and 
charcoal. The above is the quantity that will do for six hams. 

Westphalia Ham, to cure. No. 3. 
Rub every ham with four ounces of saltpetre. Next day put 
bay salt, common salt, and coarse sugar, half a pound of each, 
into a quart of stale strong beer, adding a small quantity of each 
of these ingredients for every ham to be made at that time. 
Boil this pickle, and pour it boiling hot over every ham. Let 
them lie a fortnight in it, rubbing them well and turning them 
twice a day. Then smoke the ham for three days and three 
nights over a fire of saw- dust and horse-litter, fresh made 
from the stable every night ; after which smoke them for a 
fortnight over a wood fire like other bacon. 

Westphalia Ham, to cure. No. 4. 
For two hams the following proportions may be observed : 
wash your hams all over with vinegar, and hang them up for 
two or three days. Take one pound and a half of the brownest 
sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of bay salt, and a 
quart of common salt ; mix them together ; heat them before 
the fire as hot as you can bear your hand in, and rub it well 
into the hams before the fire, till they are very tender. Lay 
them in a tub made long for that purpose, or a butcher's tray, 
that will hold them both, one laid one way and the other the 
contrary way, and strew the remainder of the ingredients over 
them. When the salt begins to melt, add a pint of vinegar, and 
let them lie three weeks, washing them with the liquor and 
turning them every day. Dry them in saw-dust smoke; hang 
them in a cellar ; and if they mould it will do them no harm, 
as these hams require damp and not extreme driness. Juniper- 
berries thrown into the fire at which they are smoked greatly 
improve their flavour, 

Westphalia Ham, to cure. No. 5. 
One pound of common salt, one pound of bay salt, four 
ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of black pepper ; pound them 
separately, then mix them, and rub the ham very well until the 
whole is used. Rub one pound of treacle on them ; lay them 
in the pickle one month, turning them every day. The quantity 
here specified will do for two hams. Before you hang them up, 
steep them in a pail of water for twelve hours.

Westphalia Ham, to cure. No. 6. 
Make a good brine of salt and water, sufficiently strong to 
bear an egg ; boil .and skim it clean, and when quite cold rub 
the meat with sal prunella and saltpetre mixed together. Put 
it in a vessel, and pour your brine into it ; and, when the ham 
has been in the brine about fourteen days, take it out, drain it, 
and boil the brine, putting in a little salt, and letting it boil till 
clear. Skim it, and when cold put in your ham, rubbing it 
over with saltpetre, &c. as you did at first. Then let your ham 
again lie in the brine for three weeks longer ; afterwards rub 
it well with bran, and have it dried by a wood fire. 

English Hams, to make like Westphalia, No. 1. 

Cut your legs of pork like hams ; beat them well with a 
wooden mallet, till they are tender, but great care must be taken 
not to crack or break the skin, or the hams will be spoiled. 
To three hams take half a peck of salt, four ounces of saltpetre, 
and five pounds of coarse brown sugar ; break all the lumps, 
and mix them well together. Rub your hams well with tliis 
mixture, and cover them with the rest. Let them lie three 
days ; then hang them up one night, and put as much water 
to the salt and sugar as you think will cover them ; the pickle 
must be strong enough to bear an egg: boil and strain it, and, 
when it is cold, pack your hams close, and cover them with the 
pickle at least an inch and half above their tops. Let them 
lie for a fortnight ; then hang them up one night ; the next 
day rub them well with bran, and hang them in the chimney 
of a fire-place in which turf, wood, or sawdust is burned. If 
they are small they will be dry enough in a fortnight ; if large, 
in two or three days more. Then hang them up against a wall 
near a fire, and not in a damp place. Tongues may be cured 
in the same manner, and ribs of beef may be put in at the same 
time with the hams. You must let the beef lie in the pickle 
three weeks, and take it out when you want to boil it without 
drying it. 

English Hams, to make like Westphalia. No. 2. 

Cut oflT with the legs of young well grown porkers part of 
the flesh of the hind loin ; lay them on either side in cloths, and 
press out the remaining blood and moisture, laying planks on 
them with heavy weights, which bring them into form ; then 
salt them well with common salt and sugar finely beaten, and 
lay them in troughs one upon another, pressed closely down 
and covered with hyssop. Let them remain thus for a fort- 
night ; then pass through the common salt, and with saltpetre 
rub them well over, which may be continued three or four days.

till they soak. Take them out, and hang them in a dose bam 
or smoke-loft ; make a moderate fire mider them, if possible of 
juniper- wood, and let them hang to sweat and dry well. After- 
wards hang them up in a dry and airy place to the wind for 
three or four days, which will remove the ill scent left by the 
smoke ; and wrap them up in sweet hay. To dress them, put 
them into a kettiie of water when it boils; keep them well 
covered till they are done, and very few can distinguish them 
from the true Westphalia. 

English Hams, to make like Westphalia. No. 3. 

Take a ham of fifteen or eighteen pounds weight, two ounces 
of saltpetre, one pound of coarse sugar, one ounce of petre- 
salt, one ounce of bay salt, and one ounce of sal prunella, 
mixed with common salt enough to cover the ham com- 
pletely. Turn your ham every other day, and let it remain 
in salt for three weeks. Take it out, rub a little bran over 
it, and dry it in a wood fire chimney, where a constant 
fire is kept : it will be fit for eating in a month. The quan- 
tity of the above ingredients must be varied according to the 
size of your ham. Before you dress it soak it over-night in 
water. 

Hams from bacon pigs are better than pork. An onion 
shred small gives it a good flavour. 

Green Hams. 

Salt a leg of pork as for boiling, with a little saltpetre to 

ake it red. Let it lie three weeks in salt, and then hang for 

a month or six weeks ; but if longer it is of no consequence. 

When boiled, stuff with young strawberry leaves and parsley, 

which must be particularly well washed or they will be gritty. 

Ham, to prepare for dressing without soaking. 

Put the ham into a coarse sack well tied up, or sew it up in 
a cloth. Bury it three feet under ground in good mould ; there 
let it remain for three or four days at least. This is an admir- 
able way. The ham eats much mellower and finer than when 
soaked. 

Ham, to dress. 

Boil the ham for two hours ; take it out and trim it neatly 
all round ; prepare in a stewpan some thin slices of veal, so as 
to cover the bottom ; add to it two bunches of carrots sliced, 
six large onions, two cloves, two bunches of parsley, a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, a pint of beef jelly, a bottle of 
white wine, and three pints of boiling water. Place the ham in 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 121 

the stewpan, and let it boil an hour and three quarters ; then 
serve it immediately without sauce, preserving the sauce for 
other use. 

Hamy to roast. 

Tie or sew up the ham in a coarse cloth, put it into a sack, 
and bury it three or four feet under ground, for three or four 
days before you dress it. Wash it in warm water, pare it, and 
scrape the rind. Spit and lay it down to roast. Into a broad 
stewpan put a pint of white wine, a quart of good broth, half 
a pint of the best vinegar, two large onions sliced, a blade of 
mace, six cloves, some pepper, four bay-leaves, some sweet basil, 
and a sprig of thyme. Let all these have a boil ; and set the 
liquor under the ham, and baste very frequently with it. When 
the ham is roasted, take up the pan ; skim all the fat off; pour 
the liquor through a fine sieve ; then take off the rind of the 
ham, and beat up the liquor with a bit of butter; put this sauce 
under, and serve it. 

Ham, entrie of. 

Cut a dozen slices of ham ; take off the fat entirely ; fry 
them gently in a little butter. Have a good brown rich sauce 
of gravy ; and serve up hot, with pieces of fried bread, cut of 
a semicircular shape, of the same size as the pieces of ham, and 
laid between them. 

Ham toasts. 

Cut slices of dressed ham, and thin slices of bread, or French 
roll, of the same shape ; fry it in clarified butter ; make the 
ham hot in cullis, or good gravy, thickened with a little floured 
butter. Dish the slices of ham on the toast ; squeeze the juice 
of a Seville orange into the sauce ; add a little pepper and salt ; 
and pour it over them. 

Ham and Chicken, to pot, Mrs, Vanbrugh's receipt. 
Put a layer of ham, then another of the white part of chicken, 
just as you would any other potted meat, into a pot. When it 
is cut out, it will shew a very pretty stripe. This is a delicate 
way of eating ham and chicken. 

Another way. 
Take as much lean of a boiled ham as you please, and half 
the quantity of fat ; cut it as thin as possible ; beat it very fine 
in a mortar, with a Uttle good oiled butter, beaten mace, pep- 
per, and salt ; put part of it into a china pot. Then beat the 
white part of a fowl with a very little seasoning to qualify the 
ham. Put a layer of chicken, then one of ham, then another 
of chicken at the top ; press it hard down, and, when it is cold, 

G 



122 MEATS AND VEGETABL£S. 

pour clarified butter over it. When you send it to table in the 
pot, cut out a thin slice in the form of half a diamond, and lay 
it round the edge of the pot. 

Herb sandwiches. 

Take twelve anchovies, washed and cleaned well, and chop- 
ped very fine ; mix them with half a pound of butter ; this 
must be run through a sieve, with a wooden spoon. With this, 
butter bread, and make a salad of tarragon and some chives, 
mustard and cress, chopped very small, and put them upon 
the bread and butter. Add chicken in slices, if you please, or 
hard-boiled eggs. 

Hog* 8 Puddings, Black, No. 1. 

Steep oatmeal in pork or mutton broth, of milk ; put to it 
two handfuls of grated bread, a good quantity of shred herbs, 
and some pennyroyal : season with salt, pepper, and ginger, 
and other spices if you please ; and to about three quarts of 
oatmeal put two pounds of beef suet shred small, and as much 
hog suet as you may think convenient. Add blood enough to 
make it black, and half a dozen eggs. 

Hog's Puddings, Black. No'. 2. 
To three or four quarts of blood, strained through a sieve 
while warm, take the crumbs of twelve-pennyworth of bread, 
four pounds of beef suet not shred too fine, chopped parsley, 
leeks, and beet ; add a little powdered marjoram and mint, half 
an ounce of black pepper, and salt to your taste. When you 
fill your skins, mix these ingredients to a proper thickness in 
the blood ; boil them twenty minutes, pricking them as they 
rise with a needle to prevent their bursting. 

Hogs Puddings, Black. No. 3. 
Steep a pint of cracked oatmeal in a quart of milk till tender; 
add a pound of grated bread, pennyroyal, leeks, a little onion 
cut small, mace, pepper, and salt, to your judgment. Melt 
some of the leaf of the fat, and cut some of the fat small, accord- 
ing to the quantity made at once ; and add blood to make the 
ingredients of a proper consistence. 

Hog's Puddings, White, No. 1, 
Take the pith of an ox, and lay it in water for two days, 
changing the water night and morning. Then drv the pith well 
in a cloth, and, having scraped off all tiie skin, beat it well ; add 
a little rose-water till it is very fine and without lumps. Boil 
a quart or three pints of cream, according to the quantity of 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 123 

pith, ¥rith such spices as suit your taste : beat a quarter of a 
pound of ahnonds and put to the cream. When it is cold, rub it 
through a hair sieve ; then put the pith to it, with the yolks of 
eight or nine eggs, some sack, and the marrow of four bones 
shred small ; some sweetmeats if you like, and sugar to your 
taste : if marrow cannot be procured suet will do. The best 
spices to put into the cream are nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon; 
but very little of the last. 

Hog's Puddings, White. No. 2. 
Take a quart of cream and fourteen eggs, leaving out half the 
whites ; beat them but a little, and when the cream boils up 
put in the eggs ; keep them stirring on a gentle fire till the 
whole is a thick curd. When it is almost cold, put in a pound 
of grated bread, two pounds of suet shred small, having a little 
salt mixed with it, half a pound of almonds well beaten in 
orange-flower water, two nutmegs grated, some citron cut 
small, and sugar to your taste. 

Hog's Puddings, White. No. 3. 
Take two poimds of grated bread ; one pint and a half of 
cream ; two pounds of beef suet and marrow ; half a pound of 
blanched almonds, beat fine with a gill of brandy ; a little rose- 
water; mace, cloves, and nutmeg, pounded, a quarter of an 
ounce ; half a pound of currants, well picked and dried ; ten 
eggs, leaving out half the whites ; mix all these together, and 
boU them hsdf an hour. 

Kabob, an India ragout. 
This dish may be made of any meat, but mutton is the best. 
Take a slice from a tender piece, not sinewy, a slice of ginger, 
and a slice of onion, put them on a silver skewer alternately, 
and lay them in a stewpan, in a little plain gravy. This is the 
kabob. Take rice and split peas, twice as much rice as peas ; 
boil them thoroughly together, coloured with a little turmeric, 
and serve them up separately or together. . The ginger must be 
steeped over-night, that you may be able to cut it. 

Another way. 
To make the kabob which is usudly served up with pilaw, 
take a lean piece of mutton, and leave not a grain of fat or skin 
upon it; pound it in a mortar as for forcemeat; add half 
a clove of garlic and a spoonful or more of curry-powder, 
according to the size of the piece of meat, and the yolk of an 

G 2 



124 MEATS AND VEGETABLES, 

egg. Mix all well together; make it into small cakes; fry it 
of a light brown, and put it round the pilaw. 

Leg of Lamb, to boil. 
Divide the leg from the loin of a hind quarter of lamb ; slit 
the skin off the leg, and cut out the flesh of one side of it, and 
chop this flesh very small ; add an equal quantity of shred beef 
suet and some sweet-herb& shred smsdl ; season with nutmeg, 
pepper, and salt ; break into it two eggs. Mix all well toge- 
ther, put it into the leg, sew it up, and boil it. Chop the loin 
into steaks, and fry them, and, when the leg is boiled enough, 
lay the steaks round it. Take some white wine, anchovies, 
nutmeg, and a quarter of a pound of butter; thicken with the 
yolks of two eggs ; pour it upon the lamb, and so serve it up. 
Boil your lamb in a cloth. 

Leg of Lamb, with forcemeat. 

Slit a leg of lamb on the wrong side, and take out as much 
meat as possible, without cutting or cracking the outward skin. 
Pound this meat well with an equal weight of fresh suet : add 
to this the pulp of a dozen large oysters, and two anchovies 
boned and clean washed. Season the whole with salt, black- 
pepper, mace, a little thyme, parsley, and shalot, finely shred 
together; beat them all thoroughly with the yolks of three 
eggs, and, having filled the skin tight with this stuffing, sew it 
up very close. Tie it up to the spit and roast it. Serve it 
with any good sauce. 

Shoulder of Lamb, grilled. 

Half roast, then score, and season it with pepper, salt, and 
cayenne. Broil it; reserve the gravy carefully; pass it through 
a sieve to take off all fat. Mix with it muslu*oom and walnut 
ketchup, onion, the size of a nut, well bruised, a little chopped 
parsley, and some of the good jelly reserved for sauces. Put a 
good quantity of this sauce ; make it boil, and pour it boiling 
hot on the lamb when sent to table. 

Lamb-, to ragout. 
Roast a quarter of lamb, and when almost done dredge it 
well with grated bread, which must be put into the dish you 
serve it up in; take veal cullis, salt, pepper, anchovy, and lemon 
juice ; warm it, lay the lamb in it, and serve i^ up. 

Lamb, to fricassee. 
Cut the hind quarter of lamb into thin slices, and season them 
with spice, sweet-herbs, and a shalot; fry and toss them up in 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 125 

some strong broth, with balls and palates, and a little brown 
gravy to thicken it. 

Miscellaneous directions respecting Meat. 
A leg of veal, the fillet without bone- the knuckle for steaks, 
and a pie ; bone of fillet and knuckle for soup. — Shoulder of 
veal, knuckle cut off for soup. — Breast of veal, thin end stews, 
or re-heats as a stew. — Half a calf's head boils, then hashes, 
with gravy from the bones. — For mock turtle soup, neats* feet 
instead of calf's head, that is, two calves* feet and two neats* 
feet. — Giblets of all poidtry make gravy. — Ox-cheek, for soup 
and kitchen. — Rump of beef cut in two, thin part roasted, thick 
boiled : or steaks and one joint, the bone for soup. — ^The trim- 
mings of many joints wUl make gravy. — ^To boil the meat 
white, well flour the joint and the cloth it is boiled in, not let- 
ting any thing be boHed with it, and frequently skimming the 
grease. — Lamb chops fried dry and thin make a neat dish, 
with French beans in cream round them. A piece of veal 
larded in white celery sauce, to answer the chops. — Dressed 
meat, chopped fine, with a little forcemeat, and made into balls 
about the size of an egg, browned and fried dry, and sent up 
without any sauce. — Sweetbreads larded in white celery sauce. 
— ^To remove taint in meat, put the joint into a pot with 
water, and, when it begins to boil, throw in a few red clear 
cinders, let them boil together for two or three minutes, then 
take out the meat, and wipe it dry. — To keep hams, when they 
are cured for hanging up, tie them in brown paper bags tight 
round the hocks to exclude the flies, which omission occasions 
maggots. — Ginger, where spice is required, is very good in 
most things. 

Meat, general rule for roasting and boiling. 

The general rule for roasting and boiling meat is as follows : 
fifteen minutes to a pound in roasting, twenty minutes to a 
pound in boiling. 

On no account whatever let the least drop of water be 
poured on any roast meat ; it soddens it, and is a bad contri- 
vance to make gravy, which is, after all, no gravy, and totally 
spoils the meat. 

Meat, half-roasted or under-done. 

Cut small pieces, of the size of a half-crown, of half -roasted 

mutton, and put them into a saucepan with half a pint of red 

wine, the same quantity of gravy, one anchovy, a little shalot, 

whole pepper, and salt ; let them stew a little ; then put in the 



126 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

meat with a few capers, and, when thoroughly hot, thicken 
with butter rolled in flour. 

Mustard, to make. 
Mix three table-spoonfuls of mustard, one of salt, and cold 
spring water sufficient to reduce it to a proper thickness. 

CMne of Mutton, to roast. 

Let the chine hang downward, and raise the skin from the 
bone. Take slices of lean gammon of bacon, and season it 
with chives, parsley, and white pepper; spread them over the 
chine, and lay the bacon upon them. Turn the skin over 
them, and tie it up ; cover with paper, and roast. When nearly 
done, dredge with crumbs of bread, and serve up, garnishing 
with mutton cutlets. 

Mutton chops, to stew. 

Put them in a stewpan, with an onion, and enough cold 
water to cover them ; when come to a boil, skim and set them 
over a very slow fire till tender ; perhaps about three quarters 
of an hour. 

Turnips may be boiled with them. 

Mutton cutlets. 
Cut a neck of mutton into cutlets ; beat it till very tender ; 
wash it with thick melted butter, and strew over the side which 
is buttered some sweet-herbs, chopped small, with grated 
bread, a little salt, and nutmeg. Lay it on a gridiron over a 
charcoal fire, and, turning it, do the same to that side as the 
other. Make sauce of gravy, anchovies, shalots, thick butter, 
a little nutmeg, and lemon. 

Mutton cutlets, with onion sauce. 
Cut the cutlets very small ; trim all round, taking off all 
the fat ; cut off the long part of the bone ; put them into a stew- 
pan, with all the trimmings that have been cut off, together 
with one onion cut in slices ; add some parsley, a carrot or 
two, a pinch of salt, and six table-spoonfuls of mutton or veal 
jelly, and let them stew till the cutlets are of a brown colour 
all round, but do not let them bum. Take out the cutlets, 
drain them in a sieve, and let them cool ; then strain the sauce 
till it becomes of a fine glaze, and re- warm them. Have ready 
some good onion sauce ; put it in the middle of the dish ; place 
the cutlets — eight, if they are small — round it, and serve the 
glaze with them ; take care it does not touch the onion sauce» 
but pour it round the outside part.

Mutton httm8, to make. 

Cat a hind quarter of mutton like a bam. Take one ounce 
of saltpetre, one pound of coarse sugar, and one pound of com- 
mon salt ; mix them together, and rub the ham well with them. 
Lay it in a hoUow tray with the skin downward ; baste it every 
day for a fortnight; then roll it in sawdust, and hang it in 
wood smoke for a fortnight. Boil and hang it in a dry place ; 
cut it out in rashers. It does not eat well boiled, but is deli- 
cious broiled. 

Haricot Mutton. 

Take a neck of mutton, and cut it in the same manner as for 
mutton chops. When done, lay them in your stewpan, with a 
blade of mace, some whole peppercorns, a bimch of sweet-herbs, 
two onions, one carrot, one turnip, all cut in slices, and lay. 
them over your mutton. Set your stewpan over a slow fire, 
and let the chops stew till they are brown ; turn them, that the 
other side may be the same. Haye ready some good gravy, and 
pour on them, and let them stew till they are very tender. 
Your ragout must be turnips and carrots cut into dice, and 
small onions, all boiled very tender, and well stirred up in the 
liquor in which your mutton was stewed. 

Another way. 

Fry mutton chops in butter till they are brown, but not ddne 
through. Lay them flat in a stewpan, and just cover them 
with gravy. Put in small onions, whole carrots, and turnips, 
scooped or cut into shapes ; let them stew very gently for two 
hours or more. Season the chops before you fry them with 
pepper and salt. 

Leg of Mutton. 

To give a leg of mutton the taste of mountain meat, hang 
it up as long as it will keep fresh ; rub it every day with gin- 
ger and coarse brown sugar, leaving it on the meat. 

Leg of Mutton in the French fashion, 
A leg of mutton thus dressed is a very excellent dish. Pare 
off all the skin as neatly as possible ; lard the leg with the best 
lard, and stick a few cloves here and there, wiSi half a clove 
of garlic, laid in the shank. When half roasted, cut off three 
or four thin pieces, so as not to disfigure it, about the shank 
bone ; mince these very fine with sage, thyme, mint, and any 
other sweet garden herbs; add a little beaten ginger, very 
little, three or four grains; as much cayenne pepper, two 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, two ladlefols of claret wine, a few 
capers, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs : stew these in some 



128 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

meat jelly, and, when thoroughly stewed, pour over your roast, 
and serve it up. Do not spare your meat jelly ; let the sauce 
be in generous quantity. 

Leg of Mutton or Beef, to hash. 
Cut small flat pieces of the meat, taking care to pare the 
skin and sinews, but leaving as much fat as you can find in the 
inside of the leg ; season with a little salt and cayenne pepper 
and a little soup jelly ; put in two whole onions, two bunches 
of parsley, the same of thyme, and a table-spoonful of mush- 
room-powder. Take two or three little balls of flour and butter, 
of the size of a nut, to thicken the sauce ; beat it well toge- 
ther ; let this simmer a little while ; take oflf the scum ; put in 
the meat, and let it boil. Serve up hot, with fried bread round it. 

Another way. 
Take the mutton and cut it into slices, taking oflf the skin and 
fat ; beat it well, and rub the dish with garlic ; put in the mut- 
ton with water, and season with salt, an onion cut in half, and 
a bundle of savoury herbs ; cover it, and set it over a stove and 
stew it. When half stewed, add a little white wine (say two 
glasses) three blades of mace, and an anchovy; stew it till 
enough done ; then take out the onion and herbs, and put the 
hash into the dish, rubbing a piece of butter in flour to thicken 
it, and serve it up. 

Loin of Mutton, to stew. 
Cut your mutton in steaks, and put it into as much water as 
will cover it. When it is skimmed, add four onions sliced and 
four large turnips. 

Neck of Mutton, to roast. 
Draw the neck with parsley, and then roast it ; and, when 
almost enough, dredge it with white pepper, salt, and crumbs ; 
serve it with the juice of orange and gravy. 

Neck of Mutton, to boil. 
Lard a neck of mutton with lemon-peel, and then boil it in 
salt and water, with sweet-herbs. While boiling, stew a pint of 
oysters in their own liquor, half a pint of white wine, and the 
like quantity of broth ; put in two or three whole onions and 
some anchovies, grated nutmeg, and a little thyme. Thicken 
the broth with the yolks of four eggs, and dish it up with 
sippets. Lay the oysters under the meat, and garnish with 
barberries and lemon. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 129 

Neck of Mutton^ to fry. 

Take the best end of a neck of mutton, cut it into steaks, 
beat them with a rolling-pin, strew some salt on them, and lay 
them in a frying-pan : hold the pan over a slow fire that may 
not bum them : turn them as they heat, and there will be 
gravy enough to fry them in, till they are half done. Then 
put to them some good gravy ; let them fry together, till they 
are done ; add a good bit of butter, shake it up, and serve it 
hot with pickles. 

Saddle of Mutton and Kidneys, 

Raise the skin of the fore-chine of mutton, and draw it with 
lemon and thyme; and with sausage-meat farce part of it. 
Take twelve kidneys, farce, skewer, and afterwards broil them; 
and lay round horseradish between, with the gravy under. 

Shoulder of Mutton, to roast in blood. 
Cut the shoulder as you would venison ; take off the skin, 
and let it lie in blood all night. Take as much powder of sweet- 
herbs as will lie on a sixpence, a little grated bread, pepper, 
nutmeg, ginger, and lemon-peel, the yolks of two eggs boiled 
hard, about twenty oysters, and some salt; temper these all 
together with the blood ; stuff the meat thickly with it, and 
lay some of it about the mutton ; then wrap Uie caul of the 
sheep about the shoulder ; roast it, and baste it with blood till 
it is nearly done. Take off the caul, dredge, baste it with but- 
ter, and serve it with venison sauce. If you do not cut it 
venison fashion, yet take off the skin, because it will eat tough ; 
let the caul be spread while it is warm, and, when you are to 
dress it, wrap it up in a cloth dipped in hot water? For sauce, 
take some of the bones of the breast ; chop and put to them a 
whole onion, a little lemon-peel, anchovies, and a little spice. 
Stew these ; add some red wine, oysters, and mushrooms. 

Shoulder, or Leg of Mutton, with Oysters, 
Make six holes in either a shoulder or leg of mutton with a 
knife : roll in eggs with your oysters, with crumbs and nutmeg, 
and stuff three or four in every hole. If you roast, put a caul 
over it ; if for boiling, a napkin. Make some good oyster sauce, 
which lay under, and serve up hot. 

Roasted Mutton, with stewed Cucumbers. 
Bone a neck and loin of mutton, leaving on only the top 
bones, about an inch long ; draw the one with parsley, and 
lard the other with bacon very closely ; and, after skewering, 
roast them. Fry and stew your cucumbers ; lay them under 
the mutton, and season them with salt, pepper, vinegar, and 

g5 



130 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

minced shalot, and put the sauce under th^ mutton, garnishing 
with pickled cucumbers and horseradish. 

Mutton to eat like Venison, 

Boil and skin a loin of mutton ; take the bones, two onions, 
two anchovies, a bunch of sweet-herbs, some pepper, maee, 
carrot, and crust of bread ; stew these all together for gravy ; 
strain it off, and put the mutton into a stewpan with the fat side 
downward ; add half a pint of port wine. Stew it till tho- 
roughly done. 

Mutton in epigram. 

Roast a shoulder of mutton till it is three parts done, and 
let it cool ; raise the skin quite up to the knuckle, and cut off 
all to the knuckle. Sauce the blade-bone ; broil it, and hash 
the rest, putting in some capers, with good gravy, pickled 
cucumbers, and shalots. Stir them well up, and lay the blade- 
bone on the skin. 

Mushrooms, to stew brown. 

Take some pepper and salt, with a little cayenne and a little 
cream ; thicken with butter and flour. To do them white, cut 
out all the black inside. 

Newmarket John, 

Cut the lean part of a leg of mutton in little thin coUops ; 
beat them ; butter a stewpan, and lay the collops all over. 
Have ready pepper, salt, shalot or garlic, and strew upon them. 
Set them over a very slow fire. As the gravy draws, turn over 
the collops, and dredge in a very little flour ; have ready some 
good hot gravy. Shake it up all together, and serve with 
pickles. 

Ox'Cheek, to stew. 

Choose one that is fat and young, which may be known by 
the teeth ; pick out the eye-balls ; cut away the snout and aU 
superfluous bits. Wash and clean it perfectly; well dry it 
in a cloth, and, with the back of a cleaver, break all the bones 
in the inside of the cheek; then with a rollingpin beat the 
flesh of the outside. If it is intended for the next day's din- 
ner, proceed in this manner : — quarter and lard it with mar- 
row ; then pour on it garlic or elder vinegar so gently that it 
may sink into the flesh; strew salt over it, and let it remain 
so till morning. Then put it into a stewpan, big enough, if 
you do both cheeks, to admit of their l)dng flat close to one 
another ; but first rub the pan well with garlic, and with a 
spoon spread a pound of butter and upwards at the bottom and 
sides of the pan. Strew cloves and beaten mace on the cheeks, 
also th3nne and sweet maijoram, finely chopped ; then put in as 
much white wine as will cover them an inch or more above the 



MEATS AND V£6ETABL£S. 131 

meat, but wash not off the other things by pouring it on. Rub 
the lid of the pan with garlic, aud cover it so close that no 
steam can escape. Make a brisk fire under it, and, when the 
cover is so hot that you cannot bear your hand on it, then a 
slack fire will stew it, but keep it so that the cover be of the 
same heat as long as it is stewing. It must not be uncovered 
the whole time it is doing : about three hoiu-s will be sufficient. 
When you take it up, be careful not to break it ; take out the 
loose bones ; pour the liquor on the cheek ; clear from the fat 
and the dross, and put lemon-juice to it. Serve it hot. 

Another way. 
Soak it in water, and make it very clean ; put it in a gallon 
of water, with some potherbs, salt, and whole pepper. When 
stewed, so that the bones will slip out easily, take it up and 
strain off the soup ; put a bit of butter in the frying-pan with 
some flour, and fry the meat brown, taking care not to burn it. 
Put some of the soup to the flour and butter, with ketchup, 
mushrooms, anchovy, and walnut liquor. Lay the cheek in a 
deep dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Ox-tail ragout. 
Some good gravy must first be made, and the tail chopped 
through every joint, and stewed a long time in it till quite 
tender, with an onion stuck with cloves, a table -spoonful of 
port or Madeira wine, a tea- spoonful of soy, and a little ca- 
yenne. Thicken the gravy with a little flour. 

Another, 
Take two or three ox- tails; put them in a saucepan, with 
turnips, carrots, onions, and some black peppercorns ; stew 
them for four hours. Take them out ; cut them in pieces at 
every joint ; put them into a stewpan with some good gravy, 
and scraped turnip and carrot ; or cut them into the shape 
of a ninepin ; pepper and salt to your taste ; add the juice of 
half a lemon ; and send it to table very hot. 

Peas, to stew. 
Take a quart of fine peas, and two small or one large cab- 
bage lettuce ; boil the lettuce tender ; take it out of the water, 
shake it well, and put it into the stewpan, with about two 
ounces of butter, three or four little onions cut small, and the 
peas. Set them on a very slow fire, and let them stew about 
two hours ; season them to your taste with pepper and a tea- 
spoonful of sugar ; and, instead of salt, stew in some bits of 



132 MEATS AND VEGETABLES/ 

ham, which you may take out or leave in when you serve it* . 
There should not he a drop of water, except what inevitably 
comes from the lettuce. 

Another way. 

To your peas; add cabbage lettuces cut small, a small faggot 
of mint, and one onion ; pass them over the fire with a small 
bit of butter, and, when they are tender and the liquor from 
them reduced, take out the onion and mint, and add a little 
white sauce. Take care it be not too thin ; season with a little 
pepper and salt. 

Green Peas, to keep till Christmas, 

Gather your peas, when neither very young nor old, on a 
fine dry day. Shell, and let two persons holding a doth, one 
at each end, shake them backward and forward for a few mi- 
nutes. Put them into clean quart bottles ; fill the bottles, and 
cork tight. Melt some rosin in a pipkin, dip the necks of the 
bottles into it, and set them in a cool dry place. 

Another way. 
Shell the peas, and dry them in a gentle heat, not much 
greater than that of a hot summer's day. Put them when 
quite dry into linen bags, and hang them up in a dry place. 
Before they are boiled, at Christmas or later, steep them in 
half milk, half water, for twelve or fourteen hours ; then boil 
them as if fresh gathered. Beans and French beans may be 
preserved in the same manner. 

Red Pickle, for any meat, 
A quarter of a pound of saltpetre, a large common basonful 
of coarse sugar, and coarse salt. A leg of pork to lie in it a 
fortnight. 

Beef ^teak Pie, 
Rump steaks are preferable to beef ; season them with the 
usual seasoning, puff-paste top and bottom, and good gravy to 
fill the dish. 

Calfs Head Pie, 
Parboil the head ; cut it into thin slices ; season with pepper 
and salt ; lay them into a crust with some good gravy, force- 
meat balls, and yolks of eggs boiled hard. Bake it about an 
hour and a half ; cut off the lid ; thicken some good gravy with 
a little flour ; add some oysters ; serve it with or without a lid. 

Mutton or Grass Lamb Pie. 
Take a loin of mutton or lamb, and clear it from fat and skin ; 
cut it into steaks ; season them well with pepper and salt ; 
almost fill the dish with water ; lay puff paste at top and bottom. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 133 

Veal Pie (common,) 
Make exactly as you would a beef-steak pie. 

Veal Pie (rich). 
Take a neck, a fillet, or a breast of veal, cut from it your 
steaks, seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a few cloves, 
truffles, and morels ; then slice two sweetbreads ; season them 
in the same manner, and put a layer of paste round the dish ; 
then lay the meat, yolks of eggs boiled hard, and o)rsters at the 
top : fill it with water. When taken out of the oven, pour in 
at the top through a funnel some good boiled gravy, thickened 
with cream and flour boiled up. 

Veal and Ham Pie, 

Take two pounds of veal cutlets, or the best end of the neck, 
cut them in pieces about half the size of your hand, seasoned 
with pepper and a very little salt, and some dressed ham in 
slices. Lay them alternately in the dish with forcemeat or 
sausage meat, the yolks of three eggs boiled hard, and a giU of 
water. 

Veal Olive Pie, 

Make your olives as directed in the receipt for making olives ; 
put them into a crust ; fill the pie with water : when baked, 
pour in some good gravy, boiled and thickened with a little 
good cream and flour boiled together. These ingredients make 
an excellent pie. 

Beef Olive Pie. 

Make your olives as you would common beef olives; put 
them into puflF paste, top and bottom ; fill the pie with water, 
when baked, pour in some good rich gravy. 

Pigt to barbicue. 
The best pig for this purpose is of the thick neck breed, 
about six weeks old. Season the barbicue very high with 
cayenne, black pepper, and sage, finely sifted ; which must be 
rubbed well into the inside of the pig. It must then be sewed 
up and roasted, or, if an oven can be depended upon, it will 
be equally good baked. The sauce must be a very high beef 
gravy, with an equal quantity of Madeira wine in it. Send the 
pig to table whole. Be careful not to put any salt into the pig, 
as it will change its colour. 

Pig, to collar. 
Have your pig cut down the back, and bone and wash it 
clean from the blood ; dry it well, and season it with spice, salt. 



134 MEATS AND VEGETABLES^ 

parsley, and thyme, and roll it hard in a collar ; tie it close in 
a dry cloth and boil it with the bones, in three pints of water, 
a quart of vinegar, a handful of salt, a faggot of sweet-herbs, 
and whole spice. When tender, let it cool and take it off; 
take it out of the doth, and keep it in the' pickle. 

Pig, to collar in colours* 
Boil and wash your pig well, and lay it on a dresser : chop 
parsley, thyme, and sage, and strew them over the inside of- 
the pig. Beat some mace and cloves, mix with them some 
pepper and salt, and strew that over. Boil some eggs hard, 
chop the yolks, and put them in layers across your pig ; boil 
some beet-root, and cut that into slices, and lay them across ; 
then roll it up in a cloth and boil it. Before it is cold, press 
it with a weight, and it will be fit for use. 

Pig, to pickle or souce. 
Take a fair fat pig, cut off his head, and cut him through the 
middle. Take out the brains, lay them in warm water, and 
leave them all night. Roll the pig up like brawn, boil till 
tender, and then throw it into an earthen pan with salt and 
water. This will whiten and season the flesh ; for no salt must 
be put into the boiling for fear of turning it black. Then take 
a quart of this broth and a quart of white wine, boil them to- 
gether, and put in three or four bay-leaves : when cold, season 
your pig, and put it into this sauce. It will k^ep three months. 

Pig, to roast. 

Chop the liver small by itself: mince blanched bacon, capers, 

truffles, anchovy, mushrooms, sweet-herbs and garlic. Season 

and blanch the whole. Fill your pig with it ; tie it up ; 

sprinkle some good olive oil over it ; roast and serve it up hot. 

Another way. 

Put a piece of bread, parsley, and sage, cut small, into the 
belly with a little salt ; sew up the belly ; spit the pig, and 
roast it; cut off the ears and the under-jaws, which you will 
lay round ; making a sauce with the brains, thick butter and 
gravy, which lay underneath. 

Pig, to dress lamb fashion. 

After skinning the pig, but leaving the skin quite whole, 
with the head on, chine it down, as you would do mutton, 
larding it with thyme and lemon-peel; and roast it in quarters 
like lamb. Fill the other part with a plum-pudding ; sew the 
belly up, and bake it. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 135 

Pigs* Feet and Ears, fricassee of. 
Ckan the feet and ears, and boil them very tender. Cut them 
in small shreds, the length of a finger and about a quarter of 
an inch in breadth ; fry them in butter till they are brown but 
not hard ; put them into a stewpan with a littiie brown gravy 
and a good piece of butter, two spoonfuls of vinegar, and a 
good deal of mustard — enough to flavour it strong. Salt to 
your taste ; thicken with very little flour. Put in half an onion ; 
then take the feet, which should likewise be boiled as lender as 
for eating ; slit them quite through the middle ; take out the 
large bones ; dip them in eggs, and strew them over with bread 
crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt ; boil or fry them, and 
put them on the ragout, into which squeeze some lemon-juice. 

Pigs' Feet and Ears, ragout of. 
Split the feet, and take them out of souse ; dip them in eggs, 
then in bread-crumbs and chopped parlsey ; fry them in lard. 
Drain them ; cut the ears in long narrow slips ; flour them ; put 
them into some good gravy ; add ketchup, morels, and pickled 
mushrooms ; stew them into the dish, and lay on the feet. 

Pig's Heady to roll. 
Take the belly-piece and head of pork, rub it well with salt- 
petre and a very little salt ; let it lie three or four days ; wash 
it clean ; then boil the head tender, and take off all the meat 
with the ears, which cut in pieces. Have ready four neats' 
feet, also well boiled ; take out the bones, cut the meat in thin 
slices, mix it with the head, and lay it with the belly-piece : 
roll it up tight, and bind it up, and set it on one end, with a 
trencher upon it ; set it within the tin, and place a heavy weight 
upon that, and let it stand all night. In the morning take it 
out, and bind it with a fillet ; put it in some salt and water, 
which must be changed every four or five days. When sliced, 
it looks like bravm. It is also good dipped in butter and fried, 
and eaten with melted butter, mustard, and vinegar : for that 
purpose the slices should be only about three inches square. 

Pilaw, an Indian dish* 
Take six or eight ribs of a neck of mutton ; separate and take 
off all the skin and fat, and put them into a stewpan with 
twelve cloves, a small piece of ginger, twelve grains of black 
pepper, and a little cinnamon and mace, with one clove of 
garlic. Add as much water as will serve to stew these ingre- 
dients thoroughly and make the meat tender. Then take out 
the mutton, and fry it in nice butter of a light brown, with some 



ia6 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

small onions chopped fine and fried very dry ; put them to the 
mutton-gravy and spice in which it was stewed, adding a table- 
spoonful of curry-powder and half an ounce of butter. After 
mixing all the above ingredients well together, put them to the 
rice, which should be previously half boiled, and let the whole 
stew together, until the rice is done enough and the gravy, 
completely absorbed. When the pilaw is dished for table, it 
shoidd be thinly covered with plain boiled rice to make it look 
white, and served up very hot. 

Porkf to collar. 
Bone and season a breast of pork with savoury spice, parsley, 
sage, and thyme ; roll it in a hard collar of cloth ; tie it close, 
and boil it, and, when cold, keep it in souse. 

Pork, to pickle. 
Having boned your pork, cut it into such pieces as will lie 
most conveniently to be powdered. The tub used for this pur- 
pose must be sufficiently large and sound, so as to hold the 
brine ; and the narrower and deeper it is the better it will keep 
the meat. Well rub the meat with saltpetre ; then take one 
part of bay and two parts of common salt, and rub every piece 
well, covering it with salt, as you would a flitch of bacon. 
Strew salt in the bottom of the tub ; lay the pieces in it as 
closely as possible, strewing salt round the sides of the tub, 
and if the salt should even melt at the top strew no more. 
Meat thus cured will keep a long time. 

Another way. 
Cut your pork into small pieces, of the size you would boil 
at one time ; rub all the pieces very well with salt, and lay them 
on a dresser upon boards made to slope that the brine may run 
off. After remaining three or four days, wipe them with a dry 
cloth; have ready a quantity of salt mixed with a small portion 
of saltpetre : rub each piece well with this mixture, after which 
cover them all over with salt. Put them into an earthen jar, 
or large pan, placing the pieces as close together as possible, 
closing the top of the jar or pan, so as to prevent all external 
air from getting in ; put the shoulder pieces in a pan by them- 
selves. Pork prepivred in this manner will keep good a year. 

Chine of Pork, to stuff and roast. 
Make your stuffing of parsley, sage, thyme, eggs, crumbs of 
bread, and season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and shalot ; 
stuff the chine thick, and roast it gently. When about a quair 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 137 

ter roasted, cut the skin in slips, making your sauce with lemon- 
peel, apples, sugar, hutter, and mustard, just as you would, 
for a roast leg. 

Another way. 
Take a chine of pork that has hung four or five days ; make 
holes in the lean, and stuff it with a little of the fat leaf, chop- 
ped very small, some parsley, thyme, a little sage, and shalot, 
cut very fine, and seasoned with pepper and salt. It should 
be stuffed pretty thick. Have some good gravy in the dish. 
For sauce, use apple sauce. 

Pork Cutlets. 
Cut off the skin of a loin or neck of pork and make cutlets; 
season them with parsley, sage, and thyme, mixed together with 
crumbs of bread, pepper, and salt ; broil them, and make sauce 
with mustard, butter, shalot, and gravy, and serve up hot. 

Gammon, to roast. 
Let the gammon soak for twenty-four hours in warm water. 
Boil it tender, but not too much. When hot, score it with 
your knife ; put some pepper on it, and then put it into a dish 
to crisp in a hot oven ; but be mindful to pull the skin off. 

Leg of Pork, to broil. 

After skinning part of the fillet, cut it into slices, and hack it 

with the back of your knife ; season with pepper, salt, thyme, 

and sage, minced small. Broil the slices on the gridiron, and 

serve with sauce made with drawn butter, sugar, and mustard. 

Spring- of Pork, to roast. 
Cut off the spring of a knuckle of pork, and leave as much 
skin on the spring as you can, parting it from the neck, and 
taking out the bones. Rub it well with salt, and strew it all 
over with thyme shred small, parsley, sage, a nutmeg, cloves, 
and mace, beaten small and well mixed together. Rub all well 
in, and roll the whole up tight, with the flesh inward. Sew 
it fast, spit it lengthwise, and roast it. 

Potatoes, to boil. No. 1. 
The following is the celebrated Lancashire receipt for cook- 
ing potatoes : — Cleanse them well, put them in cold water, and 
boil them with their skins on exceedingly slow. When the 
water bubbles, throw in a little cold water. When they are 
done, drain the water completely away through a colander ; 
return them into a pot or saucepan without water ; cover them 



138 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

Up, and set them before the fire for a quarter of an hour longer. 
Do not pare the potatoes before they are boiled, whidi it a 
very unwholesome and wasteful practice. 

Potatoes, to boil. No. 2. 

Scrape off the rind ; put them into an iron pot ; simmer them 
till they begin to crack, and allow a fork to pierce easily ; 
then pour off the water, and put aside the lid of the pot, and 
sprinkle over some salt. Place your pot at the edge of the fire, 
and there let it remain an hour or more, and during this time 
all the moisture of the potatoes will gradually exhale in steam, 
and you will find them white or flsGcy as snow. Take them 
out with a spoon or ladle. 

Potatoes, to boil. No. 3. 

Boil them as usual ; half an hour before sending to table, 
throw away the water from them, and set the pot again on the 
fire ; sufficient moisture will come from the potatoes to prevent 
the pot from burning ; let them stand on the half stove, and 
not be peeled until sent to table. 

Potatoes, to bake. 
Wash nicely, make into balls, and bake in the Dutch oven 
a light brown. This forms a neat side or comer dish. 

Potato balls. 

Pound some boiled potatoes in a mortar, with the yolks of 
two eggs, a little pepper, and salt ; make them in balls about 
the size of an egg; do them over with yolk of egg and crumbs 
of bread ; then fry them of a light brown for table ; five balls 
for a comer dish. 

Croquets of Potatoes. 

Boil some potatoes in water, strain them, and take sufficient 
milk to make them into a mash, rather thick: before you mix 
the potatoes put the peel of half a lemon, finely grated, one 
lump of sugar, and a pinch of salt ; strain the milk after heat- 
ing it, and add the potatoes ; mash them well together ; let the 
mash cool ; roll it into balls of the shape and size of an egg; 
let there be ten or twelve of them ; brush them over with the 
yolk of egg, and roll them in crumbs of bread and a pinch of 
salt. Do this twice over; then fry them of a fine brown 
colour, and serve them with fried parsley round. 

Potatoes, to fry. 
After your potatoes are nicely boiled and skinned, grate 
them, and to every large table-spoonful of potatoes add one 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 139 

egg well beat, and to each egg a small spoonful of cream, with 
some salt. Drop as many spoonfuls as are proper in a pan in 
which is clarified butter. 

Potatoes, to mash. 
After the potatoes are boiled and peeled, mash them in a 
mortar, or on a clean board, with a broad knife, and put them 
into a stewpan. To two pounds of potatoes put in half a pint 
of milk, a quarter of a pound of butter, and a little salt ; set 
them over the fire, and keep them stirred till the butter is 
melted ; but take care they do not bum to the bottom. Dish 
them up in what form you please. 

Potatoes, French way of cooking. 
Boil the potatoes in a weak white gravy till nearly done ; 
stir in some cream and vermicelli, with three or four blades 
of mace, and let it boil till the potatoes are sufiiciently done, 
without being broken. 

Potatoes, h'la-Maitre cfhoteL 
Cut boiled potatoes into shces, not too thin ; simmer them 
in a little plain gravy, a bit of butter rubbed in a little flour, 
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt, and serve hot. 

Rice, to boil. 
To boil rice well, though a simple thing,, is rarely well done. 
Have two quarts of water boiling, while you wash six ounces 
of rice, picked clean. Change the water three or four times. 
When the rice is clean, drain and put it into the boiling water. 
Boil twenty minutes; add three quarters of a table-spoonful of 
salt. Drain off the water well •^- this is the most essential 
point — set it before the fire, spread thin to dry. When dry, 
serve it up. If the rice is not dry, so that each grain separates 
easily from the others, it is not properly boiled. 

Another way. 

Put one pound of rice into three quarts of boiling water; let 
it remain twenty minutes. Skim the water, and add one ounce 
of hog's lard and a little salt and pepper. Let it simmer gently 
over the fire closely covered, for an hour and a quarter, when 
it will be fit for use. This will produce eight pounds of 
savoury rice. 

Rissoles. No. 1. 

Take a roasted fowl, turkey, or pullet ; pull it into shreds ; 
tiiere must be neither bone nor skin. Cut some veal and ham 
into large dice ; put it into a stewpan, with a little thyme. 



140 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

carrots, onions, cloves, and two or three mushrooms. Make 
these ingredients simmer over a slow fire for two hours, taking 
care they do not bum; put in a handful of floiu*, and stir well, 
with a pint of cream and as much good broth ; let the whole 
then stew for a quarter of an hour ; continue to stir with a 
wooden spoon to prevent its burning. When it is done enough, 
strain it through a woollen strainer ; then put in the whole 
meat of the poultry you have cut, with which you must make 
little balls of the size of pigeons* eggs. Dip them twice in 
very fine crumbs of bread; wrap them in paste, rolled very 
thin ; then fry them in lard, which should be very hot. 

Rissoles, No. 2. 

Take the fleshy parts and breasts of two fowls, which cut 
into small dice, all of an equal size; then throw them into some 
white sauce, and reduce it till it becomes very thick and stiff. 
When this is cold, cut it into several pieces, and roll them to 
the size and shape of a cork ; then roll them in crumbs of bread 
very fine ; dip them into some white and yolks of eggs put up 
together with a little salt, and roll them again in bread. If 
they are not stiff enough to keep their shape, this must be re- 
peated ; then fry them of a light brown colour, drain them, 
wipe off the grease, and serve them with fried parsley between 
them. 

Rissoles, No. 3. 

Take of the pur^ made as directed for pheasant, veal, or 
game, (see Pheasant under the head Game), a sufficient quantity 
for eight rissoles, then a little of the jelly of veal, say about 
half a pint ; put in it a pinch of salt and of cayenne pepper, 
two table-spoonfuls of cream, the yolk of one egg, and a piece 
of butter of the size of a walnut ; mix this sauce well together 
over the fire, strain it, and then add the pur^. Let it cool, 
and prepare a little puff-paste sufficient to wrap the rissoles 
once over with it, taking care to roll the paste out thin. Fry 
them, and send them up with fried parsley, without sauce. 
The rissoles must be made stiff enough not to break in the 
frying. 

Rice. 

One pound of veal or fowl, chopped fine ; have ready some 
good bechamel sauce mixed with parsley and lemon-juice ; 
mix it of a good thickness. When cold, make it up into balls, 
or what shape you please; dip them in yolks of eggs and 
bread crumbs, and fry them a few minutes before they go to 
table. They should be of a light brown, and sent up with 
fried parsley. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 141 

A Robinson, to make. 
Take about eight or ten pounds of the middle of a brisket of 
beef ; let it hang a day ; then salt it for three days hung up ; 
afterwards put it in strong red pickle, in which let it remain 
three weeks. Take it out, put it into a pot with plenty of 
water, pepper, a little allspice, and onion ; let it simmer for 
seven or eight hours, but never let it boil. When quite tender, 
take out aU the bones, spread it out on a table to cool, well 
beat it out with a rollingpin, and sprinkle with cayenne, nut- 
meg, and very little cloves, pounded together. Put it in a 
coarse cloth after it is rolled ; twist it at each end to get out 
the fat, and bind it well round with broad tape ; in that state 
let it remain three days. 

Salad, to dress. 

Two or three eggs, two or three anchovies, pounded, a little 
tarragon chopped very fine, a little thick cream, mustard, salt, 
and cayenne pepper, mixed well together. After these are 
all well mixed, add oil, a little tarragon, elder, and garlic 
vinegar, so as to have the flavour of each, and then a little of 
the French vinegar, if there is not enough of the others to give 
the requisite taste. 

Bologna Sausages. 

Have the fillets of young, tender porkers, and out of the 
weight of twenty-five pounds three parts are to be lean and 
one fat ; season them well in the small shredding with salt 
and pepper, a little grated nutmeg, and a pint of white wine, 
mixed with a pint of hog's blood ; stirring and beating it well 
together, with a little of the sweet-herbs finely chopped ; with 
a funnel open the mouths of the guts, and thrust the meat 
gently into it with a clean napkin, as by forcing it with your 
hands you may break the gut. Divide them into what lengths 
you please ; tie them with fine thread, and let them dry in the 
air for two or three days, if the weather be clear and a brisk 
wind, hanging them in rows at a little distance from each 
other in the smoke-loft. When well dried, rub off the dust they 
contract with a clean cloth ; pour over them sweet olive-oil, 
and cover them with a dry earthen vessel. 

English Sausages. 
Chop and bruise small the lean of a fillet of young pork ; to 
every pound put a quarter of a pound of fat, well skinned, 
and season it with a little nutmeg, salt, and pepper, adding a. 
little grated bread; mix all these well together, and put it 
^into guts, seasoned with salt and water.

Another way. 
Take six pounds of very fine well fed pork, quite free from 
gristle and fat ; cut it very small, and beat it fine in a mortar ; 
shred six pounds of suet, free from skin, as fine as possible. 
Take a good deal of sage, the leaves picked off and washed 
clean, and shred fine as possible ; spread the meat on a clean 
table; then shake the sage, about three large spoonfuls, all 
over ; shred the yellow part of the rind of a lemon very fine, 
and throw that over, with as much sweet-herbs, when shred 
fine, as will fill a large spoon ; grate two nutmegs over it, with 
two tea-spoonfuls of bruised pepper, and a large spoonful of 
salt. Then throw over it the suet, and mix all well together, 
and put it down close in a pot. When you use it, roll it up 
with as much beaten egg as will make the sausages roll smooth ; 
let what you fry them in be hot before you put them into the 
pan ; roll them about, and when they are thoroughly hot, and 
of a fine light brown colour, they are done. By warming a 
little of the meat in a spoon when you are making it, you will 
then taste if it is seasoned enough. 

Oxford Sausages. 
Take the best part of a leg of veal and of a leg of pork, of 
each three pounds ; skin it well, and cut it into small dice. 
Take three pounds of the best beef suet (the proportion of 
which you may increase or diminish according to your taste,) 
skin it well ; add a L'ttle sage, and chop it all together as fine as 
forcemeat. When chopped, put in six or seven eggs and a 
quarter of a pound of cold water, and season to your liking 
with pepper and salt. Work it up as if you were kneading 
dough for bread ; roll it out in the form of sausages, and let 
the pan you fry them in be hot, with a bit of butter in it. 

Sausages for Scotch collops. 
Take beef suet and some veal, with a little winter savory, 
sage^ thyme, and some grated nutmeg, beaten cloves, mace, 
and a little salt and pepper. Let these be well beaten toge- 
ther ; then add two eggs beat, and heat all together. Roll 
them up in grated bread, fry, and send them up. 

Veal Sausages. 
Take half a pound of the lean of a leg of veal ; cut it in 
small pieces, and beat it very fine in a stone mortar, picking 
out all the little strings. Shred one pound and half of beef- 
suet very small ; season it with pepper, salt, cloves, and mace, 
but twice as much mace as cloves, some sage, thyme, and sweet 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 143^ 

maijoram, according to your palate. Mix all these well with 
the yolks of twelve eggs ; roll them to your fancy, and fry 
them in lard. 

Sausages without skins. 

Take a pomid and quarter of the lean of a leg of veal and a 
pound and quarter of the lean of a hind loin of pork ; pick the 
meat from the skins hefore you weigh it; then take two 
pounds and half of fresh heef-suet picked clean from the skins, 
and an ounce and half of red sage leaves, picked from the 
stalks ; wash and mince them as fine as possible ; put them to 
the meat and suet, and mince as fine as you can. Add 
to it two ounces of white salt and half an ounce of pep- 
per. Pare all the crust from a stale penny French roll, and 
soak the crumb in water till it is wet through ; put it into 
a clean napkin, and squeeze out all the water. Put the bread 
to the meat, with four new-laid eggs beaten ; then with your 
hands work all these things together, and put them into a 
clean earthen pan, pressed down close. They will keep good 
for a week. When you use this meat, divide a pound into 
eighteen parts ; flour your hands a little, and roll it up into 
pretty thick sausages, and fry them in sweet butter ; a little 
frying will do. 

Spinach, the best mode of dressing. 

Boil the spinach, squeeze the water from it completely, chop 
it a little ; then put it and a piece of butter in a stewpan with salt 
and a very little nutmeg ; turn it over a brisk fire to dry the 
remaining water. Then add a little flour ; mix it well, wet it 
with a little good broth, and let it shnmer for some time, turn- 
ing it now and then to prevent burning. 

To dress it maigre, put cream instead of broth, and an onion 
with a clove stuck in it, which you take out when you serve 
the spinach. Garnish with fried bread. Observe that if you 
leave water in it, the spinach cannot ever be good. 

Another way. 
Clean it well, and throw it into fresh water ; then squeeze 
and drain it quite dry. Chop it extremely small, and put it 
into a pan with cream, fresh butter, salt, and a very small 
quantity of pepper and nutmeg: add an onion with two cloves 
stuck in it, and serve it up very hot, with fried bread sippets 
of triangular shape round tiie dish. 

Spinach, to stew. 
Pick the spinach ,very carefully; put it into a pan of water; 
boil it in a large vessel with a good deal of salt to preserve 



144 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

the green colour, and press it down frequently that it may be 
done equally. When boiled enough to squeeze easily, drain 
it from the water, and throw it into cold water. When quite 
cold, make it into balls, and squeeze it well. Then spread 
it on a table and chop it very fine ; put a good piece of butter 
in a stewpan, and lay the spinach over the butter. Let it dry 
over a slow fire, and add a little flour ; moisten with half a pint 
of beef jelly and a very little warm water : add a little cayenne 
pepper. This spinach should be very like thick melted butter, 
and as fine and smooth as possible. 

Another way. 
Take some fine spinach, pick and wash it extremely clean. 
When well boiled, put it into cold water, and squeze it in a 
cloth very dry ; chop it very small ; put it in a stewpan with 
a piece of butter and half a pint of good cream ; stir it well 
over the fire, that it may not oil; and put in a little more cream 
just as you are going to dish it. 

Sweetbreads, ragout of. 
Wash your sweetbreads; put them into boiling water, 
and, after blanching them, throw them into cold water ; dry 
them with a linen cloth ; and put them in a saucepan over the 
fire with salt, pepper, melted bacon, and a faggot of sweet- 
herbs. Shake them together, and put some good gravy to 
moisten them ; simmer over the fire, and thicken to your liking. 

Another, 
Take sweetbreads and lamb's fry, and parboil them, cutting 
them into slices, and cocks* -combs sliced and blanched, and 
season them with pepper and salt, and other spices ; fry them 
in a little lard ; drain and toss them in good gravy, with two 
shalots, a bunch of sweet-herbs, mushrooms, and truffles. 
Thicken it with a glass of claret ; garnish with red beet root. 

Savoury Toasts, to relish Wine, 
Cut six or seven pieces of bread about the size of two fingers, 
and fry them in butter till they are of a good colour ; cut as 
many slices of ham of the same size, and put them into a stew- 
pan over a slow fire, for an hour ; when they are done take 
them out, and stir into the stewpan a little flour ; when of a 
good colour moisten it with some broth, without salt ; then 
skim off the fat, and strain the sauce through a sieve. Dish 
the ham upon the fried bread, and pour the sauce over. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 145 

Another, 

Rasp some crumb of bread ; put it over the fire in butter ; 
put over it a minced veal kidney, with its fat, parsley, seal- 
lions, a shalot, cayenne pepper and salt, mixed with the whites 
and yolks of four eggs beat : put this forcemeat on fried toasts 
of bread, covering the whole with grated bread, and passing 
the salamander over it. Serve it with a clear beef gravy 
sauce under it. 

Tomata to eat with roast meitt. 

Cover the bottom of a^at saucepan with the tomatas, that 
they may lie one upon another ; add two or three spoonfuls of 
water, a little salt and pepper, to your taste ; cover the pan, 
and stew them; in six or seven minutes turn them, and let 
them stew till they are soft. Send them up with their liquor. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 1. 
Take two fine bullocks' tongues ; wash them well in spring 
water ; dry them thoroughly with a cloth, and salt them with 
common salt, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, a quarter of a 
pound of treacle, and a quarter of a pound of gunpowder. Let 
them lie in this pickle for a month ; turn and rub them every 
day ; then take them out and dry them with a cloth ; rub a 
little gunpowder over them, and hang them up for a month, 
when they will be fit to eat, previously soaking a few hours as 
customary. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 2. 
One pound of bay salt, half a pound of saltpetre, two ounces 
of sal prunella, two pounds of coarse sugar ; make your brine 
strong enough with common salt to float an egg. The quan- 
tity of water is seven quarts, boil all together, and scum it well 
for half an hour. When cold, put the tongues in, and wash 
them in warm water before dressing. For table be sure never 
to let them boil, but simmer slowly for four or five hours. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 3. 
Take two fine neats' tongues ; cut off the roots, and cut a nick 
in the under side ; wash them clean, and dry with a cloth. Rub 
them with common salt, and lay them on a board all night. 
Next day take two ounces of bay salt, one of sal prunella, and 
a handful of juniper-berries, all bruised fine ; mix them with a 
quarter of a pound of coarse sugar and one pound of common 
salt. Rub the tongues well with this mixture ; lay them in a 
long pan, and turn and rub them daily for a fortnight. Take 
them out of the pickle, and either dry or dress them. 



l46 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 4. 
Mix some well bruised bay salt, and a little saltpetre, with 
common salt, and with a linen cloth rub the tongues and salt 
them, most particularly the roots ; and as the brine consumes 
put some more, till the tongues are hard and stiff. When they 
are Salted, roll them up, and dry them in bran. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 5. 
Have the roots well cleansed from the moisture, and with 
waim water wash and open the poroys parts, that the salt may 
penetrate, and dry them well. Cover them for a week with 
a pickle made of common salt, and bay salt well boiled in it ; 
then rub them with saltpetre, and to make them of a good red 
colour you must take them out, and rub and salt them well 
so that the salt penetrates, pressing them down hard with 
a board that, when they are put to dry, they may keep their 
due proportion. The usual way of drying them is with burnt 
sawdust, which, with the salt, gives the dusky colour that ap- 
pears on the outside before they are boiled. 

Tongues, to cure. No. 6. 
Well rub into the tongue two ounces of saltpetre, a pound 
of common salt, and a quarter of a pound of treacle; and baste 
every day for three weeks. 

Tongue, to smoke. 

Wipe the tongue dry, when taken out of the pickle ; glaze 
it over with a brush dipped in p3rroligneous acid, and heuQg it 
up in the kitchen. 

Tongue, to hake. 

Season your tongues with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; lard 
them with large lardoons, and have them steeped all night in 
vinegar, claret, and ginger. Season again with whole pepper, 
sliced nutmeg, whole cloves, and salt. Bake them in an eartiien 
pan ; serve them up on sippets, and lay your spice over them, 
with slices of lemon and some sausages. 

Tongue, to boil. 
Put a good quantity of hay with your tongues, tying them 
up in a cloth, or else in hay. Boil them till they are tender 
and of a good colour, and they will eat short and mellow. 

Tongue, to pot. 
Prick the tongues with a skewer, and salt them with bay- 
salt and saltpetre, to make them red. Boil them till they will 



^ 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 147 

just peel ; season with mace and a little pepper, to your liking; 
bake them in a pot well covered with butter, and they will keep 
afi long as any potted meat. 

Tongue and Udder^ to roast. 
Have the tongue and udder boile^ and blanched, the tongue 
being salted with saltpetre ; lard them with the whole length 
of large lardoons, and then roast them on a spit, basting them 
with butter : when roasted, dress them with grated bread and 
flour, and serve up with gravy, currant-jelly by itself, and slices 
of lemon. 

Sheep's Tongue, or any other, tpith Oysters, 
Boil six tongues in salt and water till they are sufficiently 
tender to peel. Slice them thin, and with a quart of large 
oysters put them in a dish, with some whole spice and a litUe 
claret, and let them stew together. Then put in some butter, 
and three yolks of eggs well beaten. Sl^ake them all well to- 
gether, and put some sippets and lay your tongues upon them. 

Tripe, to dress. 
Take of the finest tripe, and, when properly trimmed, cut it 
in pieces about four inches square ; put it in a stewpan, with 
as much white wine as will almost cover it : slice in three or 
four race of ginger, quarter in a nutmeg, put in a good deal 
of salt, a bundle of herbs, rosemary, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
and onion. When this has stewed gently a good while, take 
out a pint of the clearest liquor, free from fat or dross, and 
dissolve in it some anchovies finely picked. Take up the 
tripe, a bit at a time, with a fork, and lay it in a warmed dish ; 
pour on it the liquor in which the anchovies were dissolved. 
Sprinkle on it a little lemon juice. Those who are fond of 
onions or garlic may make either the prevailing ingredient. 

Tripe, to fricassee. 
Cut into slices the fat part of double tripe ; dip them into 
eggs or batter, and fry them to lay round the dish. Cut the 
other part into long slips, and into dice, and toss them up with 
onion, chopped parsley, melted butter, yolks of eggs, and a 
little vinegar. Season with pepper and salt, and serve up. 

Truffles and Morels, to stew. 
Well wash the truffles, cut them into slices, of the size and 
about the thickness of half-a-crown ; put them into a stewpan, 
with a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper, and a little butter, to 

h2 



148 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

prevent their being burnt. - Let them stew ten minutes ; have 
ready a good brown sauce of half a pint of beef and the same 
of veal jelly, thickened with a little butter and flour ; add to it 
any trimmings of the truffles or morels, and boil them also in 
it ; put in one pinch of cayenne pepper. Strain the truffles or 
morels from the butter they were first stewed in ; throw them 
into the sauce ; warm the whole again, and serve hot. 

Veal, to boil. 
Veal should be boiled well ; a knuckle of six pounds will 
take very nearly two hours. The neck must be lalso well 
boiled in a good deal of water ; if boiled in a cloth, it will be 
whiter. Serve it with tongue, bacon, or pickled pork, greens 
of any sort, brocoli, and carrots, or onion sauce, white sauce, 
oyster sauce, parsley and butter, or white celery sauce. 

Veal, to collar. 
Bone and wash a breast of veal ; steep it in three waters, 
and dry it with a cloth ; season it with savoury spice, some 
slices of bacon, and shred sweet-herbs ; roll them in a collar of 
cloth, and boil it in salt and water, with whole spice ; skim it 
clean and take it up, and when cold put it in the pickle. 

Another way. 
Take the meat of a breast of veal ; make a stuffing of beef- 
suet, crumb of bread, lemon peel, parsley, pepper, and salt, 
mixed up with two eggs ; lay it over the meat, and roll it up. 
Boil an hour and a haH, and send it to table with oyster sauce. 

Veal, to roast. 
Veal will take a quarter of an hour to a pound : paper the 
fat of the loin and fillet ; stuff the fillet and shoulder with the 
following ingredients : a quarter of a pound of suet, chopped 
fine, parsley, and sweet-herbs chopped, grated bread, lemon- 
peel, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and yolk of egg ; butter may supply 
the want of suet. Roast the breast with the caul on it tiU 
almost done; take it off, flour and baste it. Veal requires to 
be more done than beef. For sauce use salad pickles, brocoli, 
cucumbers, raw or stewed, French beans, peas, cauliflower, 
celery, raw or stewed. 

Veal, roasted, ragout of. 
Cut slices of veal about the size of two fingers and at least 
as long as three ; beat them with a cleaver till they are no 
thiqker than a crown-piece ; put upon every slice some stuffing 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. l49 

made with beef-suet, ham, a little thyme, parsley, scallions, and 
a shalot. When the whole is minced, add the yolks of two 
eggs, half a table-spoonful of brandy, salt, and pepper ; spread 
it on the veal and roll it. Cover each piece with a thin slice 
of bacon, and tie it carefully. Then put them on a small deli- 
cate spit covered with paper ; and, when they are done, take 
off the paper carefully, grate bread over them, and brown them 
at a clear fire. Serve £em with a gravy sauce. 

Veal, to stew. 
Cut the veal into small pieces ; season with an onion, some 
salt and pepper, mace, lemon-peel, and two or three shsdots ; 
let them stew in water, with a little butter, or port wine, if you 
like. When enough done, put in some yolks of eggs beaten, 
and boil them quick. Dish and serve them up. 

Vealf with Rice, to stew. 
Boil half a pound of rice in three quarts of water in a small 
pan with some good broth, about a pint, and slices of ham at 
the bottom, and two good onions. When it is almost done, 
spread it, about twice the thickness of a crown-piece, over a 
silver or delft dish in which it is to be served [it must be a dish 
capable of bearing the fire] . Lay slices of veal and ham alter- 
nately — the veal having already been dressed brown. Cover 
the meat with rice in such a manner that it cannot be seen ; 
put your dish upon a hot stove ; brown the rice with a sala- 
mander ; drain off the fat that may be in the dish, and serve 
it dry, or, if it is preferred, with any of the good sauces, for 
which there are directions, poured under it. 

Veal served in paper. 
Cut some slices of veal from the fillet, about an inch thick, in a 
small square, about the size of a small fricandeau ; make a box of 
paper to fit neatly ; rub the outside with butter, and put in your 
meat, with sweet oil or butter, parsley, scallions, shsdots, and 
mushrooms, all stewed very fine, salt, and whole pepper. Set 
it upon the gridiron, with a sheet of oiled paper under it, and 
let it do by a very slow fire, lest the paper bum. When the 
meat is done on one side turn it on the other. Serve it in the 
box, having put over it very gently a dash of vinegar. 

Bombarded Veal, 
Take a piece of a long square of bacon ; cut it in thin slices ; 
do the same with veal, and lay the slices on your bacon. Hav- 
ing made a piece of good forcemeat, spread it thin on your veal. 



150 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

having preyiously seasoned the latter with pepper and salt.' 
Roll these up one by one ; spit them on a lark «pit, quite even ; 
wash them over with eggs and crumbs of bretBui ; then roast 
them, and serve up with a good ragout. 

Veal Balls. 
Take two pounds of veal ; pick out the skin and bones ; mix 
it well with the crust of a French roll, soaked in hot milk, half 
a pound of veal suet, two yolks of eggs, onion, and chopped 
parsley ; season with pepper and salt. Roll the balls in rasp- 
ing^ ; fry them of a gold colour ; boil the bones and the bits 
of skin to make the gravy for them. 

Breast of Veal, 
To fricassee it like fowls, parboil it ; turn it a few times 
over the fire with a bit of butter, a bunch of parsley, scallions, 
some mushrooms, truffles, and morels. Shake in a little flour ; 
moisten with some good stock broth ; and when the whole is 
done and skimmed, thicken it with the yolks of three eggs 
beat with some milk ; and, before it is served, add a very littie 
lemon juice. 

Breast of Veal, with Cabbage and Bacon, 
Cut the breast of veal in pieces, and parboil it ; parboil also 
a cabbage and a bit of streaked bacon, cut in slices, leaving 
the rind to it. Tie each separately with packthread, and let 
them stew together with good broth ; no salt or pepper, on 
account of the bacon. When the whole is done, tsie out the 
meat and cabbage, and put them into the terrine you serve to 
table. Take the fat off the broth, put in a little cullis, and 
reduce the sauce over the stove. When of a proper thickness 
pour it over the meat, and serve up. 

Breast of Veal en fricandeau. 
Lard your veal, and take a ragout of asparagus, (for which 
see Ragouts,) and lay your veal, larded or glazed, upon the 
ragout. The same may be done with a ragout of peas. 

Breast of Veal, glazed brown. 
Take a breast of veal, cut in pieces, or whole if you prefer it. 
Stir a bit of butter and a spoonful of flour over Uie fire, and, 
when it is of a good colour, put in a pint of broth, and after- 
wards the veal. Stew it over a slow fire, and season with 
pepper and salt, a bunch of parsley, scallions, cloves, thyme, 
laurel, basil, and half a spoonful of vinegar. When the meat 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 151 

is done and well glazed, skim the sauce well, and serve it 
round it. 

Breast of Veal, to stew with Peas. 
Cut the nicest part of the breast of veal, with the sweet- 
bread ; roast it a little brown ; take a little bit of the meat that 
is cut off the ends, and fry it with butter, salt, pepper, and 
flour ; take a little hot water just to rinse out the gravy that 
adheres to the frying-pan, and put it into a stewpan, wiUi two 
quarts of hot water, a bundle of parsley, thyme, and marjoram, 
a bit of onion or shsdot, plenty of lemon-peel, and a pint of old 
green peas, the more mealy the better. Let it stew two or 
three hours, then rub it through a sieve with a spoon; it 
should be all nice and thick ; then put it again in the stewpan 
with the meat, having ready some hot water to add to the 
gravy in case it should be wanted. A thick breast will take 
two hours, and must be turned every now and then. Boil 
about as many nice young peas as would make a dish, the 
some as for eating ; put them in about ten minutes before you 
take it up, skimming all the fat nicely off; and season it at the 
same time with salt and cayenne to your taste. 

Another way. 

Cut your veal into pieces, about three inches long ; fiy it 
delicately ; mix a little flour with some beef broth, with an 
onion and two cloves ; stew this some time, strain it, add three 
pints or two quarts of peas, or heads of asparagus, cut like 
peas. Put in the meat \ let it stew gently ; add pepper and 
salt. 

Breast of Veal ragout. 

Bone and cut out a large square piece of the breast of veal ; 
cut the rest into small pieces, and brown it in butter, stewing 
it in your ragout for made dishes ; thicken it with brown but- 
ter, and put the ragout in the dish. Lay diced lemon, sweet- 
breads, sippets, and bacon, fried in batter of eggs ; then lay on 
the square piece. Gramish with sliced oranges. 

Veal Collops, with Oysters. 
Cut thin slices out of a leg of veal, as many as will make a 
dish, according to the number of your company. Laid one 
quarter of them, and fry them in butter ; take them out of the 
pan and keep them warm. Clean the pan, and put into it half 
a pint of oysters, with their liquor, and some strong broth, 
one or two shalots, a glass of white wine, two or three ancho- 
vies minced, and some grated nutmeg ; let these have a boil up. 



152 MEATS AND VEGETABLES, 

and thicken with five eggs and a piece of butter. Put in your 
coUops, and shake them together till the sauce is tolerably 
thick. Set them on the stove again to stew a little ; then 
serve up. 

Veal Coliops, with white sauce. 
Cut veal that has been already roasted into neat small 
pieces, round or square ; season them with a little pepper and 
salt ; pass them quick of a pale colour in a bit of butter of the 
size of a walnut ; add the yolks of five eggs, and half a pint of 
cream, with a very small onion or two, previously boiled ; toss 
them up quick, and serve hot. 

Veal Cutlets, to dress. 
Cut the veal steaks thin ; hack and season them with pep- 
per, salt, and sweet-herbs. Wash them over with melted 
butter, and wrap white paper buttered over them. Roast or 
bake them ; and^ when done, take off the paper, and serVe 
them with good gravy and Seville orange-juice squeezed on. 

Another way. 
Take the best end of a neck of veal and cut your cutlets ; four 
ribs will make eight cutlets. Beat them out very thin, and 
trim them round. Take chopped parsley, thyme, shalots, and 
mushrooms, pass them over the fire, add a little juice of lemon, 
lemon-peel, and grated nutmeg. Dip in the cutlets, crumb 
them, and boil them over a gentle fire. Save what you leave 
from dipping them in, put some brown sauce to it, and put it 
under them when going to table, first taking care to remove 
the grease from it. Lamb cutlets are done the same way. 

Veal Cutlets, larded. 
Cut a neck of veal into bones ; lard one side, and fry them 
off quick. Thicken a piece of butter, of the size of a large nut, 
with a little flour, and whole onion. Put in as much good 
gravy as will just cover them, and a few mushrooms and force- 
meat balls. Stove them tender; skim off all grease ; squeeze 
in half a lemon, and serve them up. 

Fillet of Veal, to farce or roast. 
Mince some beef suet very small, with some sweet marjoram, 
winter savory, and thyme ; season with salt, cloves, and mace, 
well beaten ; put in grated bread ; mix them all together with 
the yolk of an egg ; make small holes in the veal, and stuff it 
very thick with these. Put it on the spit and roast it well. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 153 

Let the sauce consist of butter, gravy, and juice of lemon, very 
thick. Dish the veal, and pour the sauce over it, with slices 
of lemon laid round the dish. 

Fillet of Veal, to boil. 
Cut out the bone of a fillet of veal ; put it into good milk 
and water for a little while: make some forcemeat with 
boiled clary, raw carrots, beef suet, grated bread, sweet-herbs, 
and a good quantity of shrimps, nutmeg, and mace, the yolks 
of three egg^ boiled hard, some pepper and- salt, and two raw 
eggs ; roll it up in butter, and stuff the veal with it. Boil the 
veal in a cloth for two hours, and scald four or five cucumbers, 
in order to take out the pulp the more easily. This done, fill 
them with forcemeat, and stew them in a httie thin gravy. For 
sauce take strong white gravy, thickened with butter, a very 
little flour, nutmeg, mace, and lemon-peel, three anchovies 
dissolved in lemon-juice, some good cream, the yolk of an egg 
beaten, and a glass of white wine. Serve with the cucumbers. 

Half a Fillet of Veal, to stew. 
Take a stewpan large enough for the piece of veal, put in 
some butter, and fry it till it is firm, and of a fine brown colour 
aU round ; put in two carrots, two large onions, whole, half a 
pound of lean bacon, a bunch of thyme and of parsley, a pinch 
of cayenne pepper and of ssdt : add a cupful of broth, and let 
the whole stew over a very slow fire for one hour, or accord- 
ing to the size of your piece of veal, until thoroughly done. 
Have ready a pint of jelly soup, in which stew a table-spoonful 
of mustard and the same of tniffles cut in small pieces ; add 
one ounce of butter and a dessert spoonful of flour to thicken ; 
unite it well together ; put in a glass of white wine, and boil. 
When ready to serve, pour it over the veal ; let there be sauce 
suflicient to fill the dish ; the veal must be strained from the 
vegetables, and great care taken that the sauce is well passed 
through the sieve, to keep it clear from grease. 

Knuckle of Veal, white. 
Boil a knuckle of veal in a little water kept close from the 
air, with six onions and a little whole pepper, till tender. The 
sauce to be poured over it, when dished in a little of its own 
liquor — two or three anchovies, a little mace, half a pint of 
cream, and the yolk of an egg, thickened with a little flour. 

Knuckle of Veal ragout. 
Cut the veal into slices half an inch thick ; pepper, salt, and 
flour them ; fry them of a light brown ; put the trimmings,

with the hone hroken, an onion sliced, celery, a hunch of sweet- 
herbs ; pour warm water to cover them about an inch. Stew 
gently for two hours; strain it, and thicken with flour and 
butter, a spoonful of ketchup, a glass of wine, and the juice of 
half a lemon. Give it. a boU, strain into a clean saucepan, put 
in the meat, and make it hot. 

Leg of Veal and Bacon, to boil. 
Lard the veal with bacon and lemon-peel ; boil it with a 
piece of bacon, cut in slices ; put the veal into a dish, and lay 
the bacon round it. Serve it up with green sauce made thus : 
beat two or more handfuls of sorrel in a mortar, with two pip - 
pins quartered, and put vinegar and sugar to it. 

Loin of Veal, to roast. 

Roast, and baste with butter; set a dish under your veal, with 
vinegar, a few sage leaves, and a little rosemary and thyme. 
Let the gravy drop on these, and, when the veal is roasted, let 
the herbs and gravy boil once or twice on the fire : serve it 
under the veal. 

Loin of Veal, to roast with herbs. 

Lard the fillet of a loin of veal ; put it into an earthen pan; 
steep it three hours with parsley, scallions, a little fennel, 
mushrooms, a laurel-leaf, thyme, basil, and two shalots, the 
whole shred very fine, salt, whole pepper, a little grated nut- 
meg, and a little sweet oil. When it has taken the flavour of 
the herbs, put it upon the spit, with all its seasoning, wrapt in 
two sheets of white paper well buttered ; tie it carefully so as 
to prevent the herbs falling out, and roast it at a very slow fire. 
When it is done take oflF the paper, and with a knife pick off 
all the bits of herbs that stick to the meat and paper, and put 
them into a stewpan, with a little gravy, two spoonfuls of ver- 
juice, salt, whole pepper, and a bit of butter, about as big as 
a walnut, rolled in flour. Before you thicken the sauce, melt 
a little butter ; mix it with the yolk of an egg, and rub the 
outside of the veal, which should then be covered with grated 
bread, and browned with a salamander. Serve it up with a 
good sauce under, but not poured over so as to disturb the meat. 

Loin of Veal, fricassee of. 
Well roast a loin of veal, and let it stand till cold. Cut it 
into slices; in a saucepan over the stove melt some butter, 
with a little flour, shred parsley, and chives. Turn the stewpan 
a little for a minute or so, and pepper and salt the veal. Put 
it again into the pan, and give it three or four turns over the

6tove With a little broth, and boil it a little : then put three or 
four yolks of eggs beaten up to a cream, and some parsley 
shred, to thicken it, always keeping it stirred over the fire till 
of sufficient thickness ; then serve it up. 

Loin of Veal Bechamel, 

When the veal is nicely roasted, cut out part of the fillet 
down the back ; cut it in tiiin slices, and put some white sauce 
to what you have cut out. Season it with the juice of lemon 
and a little pepper and ssdt; put it into the veal, and cover 
the top with crumbs of bread that has been browned, or 
salamander it over with crumbs, or leave the skin of the veal 
so that you can turn it over when the seasoning part is put 
in. 

Neck of Veal, stewed with Celery, 

Take the best end of a neck, put it into a stewpan with 
beef broth, salt, whole pepper, and two cloves, tied in a bit of 
muslin, an onion, and a piece of lemon-peel. Add a little 
cream and flour mixed, some celery ready boiled, and cut into 
lengths ; and boil it up. 

Veal Olives, No. I. 
are done the same way as the beef olives, only cut off a fillet 
of veal, fried of a fine brown. The same sauce is used as for 
beef, and, if you like, small bits of curled bacon may be laid 
in the dish. Garnish with lemon and parsley. 

Veal Olives, No. 2. 

Wash eight or ten Scots collops over with egg batter ; sea- 
son and lay over a little forcemeat ; roll them up and roast 
them; make a good ragout for them; garnish with sliced 
orange. 

Veal Olives, No. 3. 

Take a good fillet of veal, and cut large collops, not too 
thin, and hack them well ; wash liiem over with the yolk of 
*^ ^SS » *^®^ spread on a good layer of forcemeat, made of 
veal pretty well seasoned. Roll them up, and wash them 
with egg ; lard them over with fat bacon, tie them round, if 
you roast them ; but, if to be baked, you need only wash the 
bacon over with egg. Garnish with slices of lemon, and for 
sauce take thick butter and good gravy, with a piece of 
lemon. 

Veal Olives, No. 4. 

Lay over your forcemeat ; first lard your collops, and lay a 
row of large oysters ; and then roll them up, and roast or

bake them. Make a ragout of oysters, sweetbreads fried, a 
few morels and mushrooms, and lay in the bottom of your 
dish, and garnish with fried oysters and grated bread. 

Veal Rumps. 
Take three veal rumps ; parboil and put them into a little 
pot, with some broth, a bunch of parsley, scallions, a clove of 
garlic, two shalots, a laurel leaf, thyme, basil, two cloves, 
salt, pepper, an onion, a parrot, and a parsnip : let them boil 
till they are thoroughly done, and the sauce is very nearly >i 
consumed. Take them out, let them cool, and strain the 
sauce through a rather coarse sieve, that none of the fat may 
remain. Put it into a stewpan, with the yolks of three eggs 
beat up, and a httle flour, and thicken it over the fire. Then 
dip your veal rumps into it, and cover them with grated 
bread; put them upon a dish, and brown them with a sala- 
mander. Serve them with sour sauce, for which see the part 
that treats of Sauces. 

Shoulder of Veal, to stew. 

Put it in an earthen pan, with a gill of water, two spoon- 
fuls of vinegar, salt, whole pepper, parsley and scsdlions, two 
cloves of garlic, a bay leaf, two onions, two heads of celery, 
three cloves, and a bit of butter. Cover the pan close, and 
close the edges with flour and water. Stew it in an oven 
three hours ; then skim and strain the sauce, and serve it over 
the veal. 

Veal Steaks, 

Cut a neck of veal into steaks, and beat them on both sides: 
beat up an egg, and with a feather wet your steaks on both 
sides. Add some parsley, thjnne, and a little maijoram, cut 
small, and seasoned with pepper and salt. Sprinkle crumbs of 
bread on both sides of the steaks, and put them up quite tight 
and close into paper which has been rubbed with butter. They 
may be either broiled or baked in a pan. 

Veal Sweetbreads, to fry. 
Cut each of your sweetbreads in three or four pieces and 
blanch them : put them for two hours in a marinade made 
with lemon-juice, salt, pepper, cloves, a bay leaf, and an onion 
sliced. Take the sweetbreads out of the marinade, and dry 
them with a cloth ; dip them in beaten yolk of eggs, with 
crumbs of bread ; fry them in lard till they are brown ; drain 
them ; fry some parsley, and put it in the middle of the dish, 
and serve them. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 157 

Veal Sweetbreads, to roast. 

Lard your sweetbreads with small lardoons of bacon, and 
put them on a skewer ; fasten them to the spit and roast them 
brown. Put some good gravy into a dish ; lay in the sweet- 
breads, and serve them very hot. You ought to set your 
sweetbreads and spit them; then egg and bread them, or 
they will not be brown. 

Vegetables, to stew. 

Cut some onions, celery, turnips, and carrots, into small 
squares, like dice, but not too small ; stew them with a bunch 
of thyme in a little broth and batter ; fry them till they are of a 
fine brown colour ; turn them with a fork, till quite soft ; if 
they are not done enough, put a little flour from the dredging- 
box to broWn them ; skim the sauce well, and pass it through 
a sieve ; add a little cayenne pepper and salt ; put the vege- 
tables in, and serve them up. 

Haunch of Venison, to roast. No. 1. 
Butter and sprinkle your fat with salt ; lay a sheet of paper 
over it; roll a thin sheet of. paste and again another sheet of 
paper over the paste, and with a packthread tie and spit it. 
Baste the sheet of paper with butter, and let the venison roast 
till done enough. Be careful how you take off the papers and 
paste, basting it with some butter during that time, and dredge 
up : then let it turn round some time to give the fat a colour. 
Tlie object of pasting is to save the fat. Have currant-jelly 
with it, and serve it up. 

Haunch of Venison, to roast. No. 2. 
Let your haunch be well larded with thick bacon; seasoning 
it with fine spices, parsley, sweet-herbs, cut small, pepper, and 
salt. Pickle it with vinegar, onions, salt, pepper, parsley, 
sweet basil, thyme, and bay-leaves : and, when pickled enough, 
spit it, and baste it with the pickle. When roasted, dish it up 
with vinegar, pepper, and thick sauce. 

Haunch of Venison, to roast. No. 3. 
Have the haunch well and finely larded with bacon, and put 
paper round it : roast and serve it up with sauce under it, 
made of good cullis or broth, gravy of ham, capers, ancho- 
vies, salt, pepper, and vinegar. 

Venison, to boil. 
Have your venison a little salted, and boil it in water. Mean- 
while boil six cauliflowers in milk and water ; and put them 



158 MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 

into a large pipkin with drawn butter ; keep them warm, and 
put in six handfuls of washed spinach, boiled in strong broth; 
pour off the broth, and put some drawn butter to it ; lay some 
sippets in the dish, and lay your spinach round the sides; have 
the venison laid in the middle, with the cauliflower over it i 
pour your butter also over, and garnish with barberries and 
minced parsley. 

Haunch of Venison, to broil. 

Take half a haunch, and cut it into slices of about half an 
inch thick ; broil and salt them over a brisk fire, and, when 
pretty well soaked, bread and serve them up with gravy : do 
the same with the chine. 

Venison, to recover when tainted. 

Boil bay salt, ale, and vinegar together, and make a strong 
brine ; skim it, and let it stand till cool, and steep the venison 
for a whole day. Drain and press it dry : parboil, and season 
it with pepper and salt. 

Another way. 

Tie your venison up in a clean cloth ; put it in the earth for 
a whole day, and the scent will be gone. 

Red Deer Venison, to pot. 

Let the venison be well boned and cut into pieces about an 
inch thick, and round, of the diameter of your pot. Season 
with pepper and salt, something higher than you would pasty, 
and afterwards put it into your pots, adding half a quarter of 
butter, and two sliced nutmegs, cloves and mace about the 
same quantity of each, but rather less of the cloves. ITien put 
into your pots lean and fat, so that there may be fat and lean 
mixed, until the pots are so nearly filled as to admit only a 
pint of butter more to be put into each. Make a paste of rye- 
flour, and stop your pots close on the top. Have your oven 
heated as you would for a pasty; put your pots in, and let them 
remain as long as for pasty ; draw them out, and let them stand 
half an hour; afterwards unstop them, and turn the pots upside 
down ; you may remove the contents, if you like, into smaller 
pots ; in which case take off all the butter, letting the gravy 
remain, and using the butter for the fresh pots; let them 
remain all night; the next day fill them with fresh butter. To 
make a pie of the same, proceed in the same way with the 
venison, only do not season it so high ; but put in a liberal 
allowance of butter. 

Venison, excellent substitute for. 

Skin a loin of mutton ; put to it a quarter of a pint of port 
wine, half a pint of spring water, two spoonfuls of vinegar. 



MEATS AND VEGETABLES. 159 

an onion with three cloves, a small bunch of thyme and pars- 
ley, a little pepper and salt, to your taste. Stew them with 
the mutton very slowly for two hours and a half ; baste it with 
the liquor very often ; skim off the fat, and send the gravy in 
the dish with the mutton. Sauce — ^the same as for venison. 

Water Cresses, to stew. 
When the cresses are nicely picked and well washed, put 
them into a stewpan with a little butter under them. T<iet them 
stew on a clear fire until almost done ; then rub them through 
a sieve ; put them again into a pan, with a dust of flour, a little 
salt, and a spoonful of good cream : give it a boil, and dish it 
up with sippets. The cream may be omitted, and the cresses 
may be boiled in salt and water before they are rubbed through 
the sieve, and afterwards stewed, but it takes the strength out, 
therefore it is best not to boil them first. 



POULTRY. 



Chicken, to make white. 
Febd them in the coop on boiled rice ; give them no water 
at all to drink. Scalded oatmeal will do as well. 

Chicken, to fricassee. No. 1. 
Empty the chicken, and singe it till the flesh gets very firm. 
Carve it as neatly as^ possible ; divide the legs at the joints 
into four separate pieces, the back into two, making in all ten 
pieces. Take out the lungs and all that remains within; 
wash aU the parts of the chicken very thoroughly in luke- 
warm water, till all the blood is out. Put the pieces in boil- 
ing water, sufficient to cover them, about four tea-cupfuls, 
and let them remain there ten minutes ; take them out, pre- 
serve the water, and put them into cold water. When quite 
cool, put two ounces of fresh butter into a stewpan with half 
a pint of mushrooms, fresh or pickled ; if pickled, they must 
be put into fresh cold water two or three hours before ; the 
water to be changed three times ; put into the stewpan two 
bunches of parsley and two large onions; add the chicken, 
and set the stewpan over the fire. When the chickens have 
been fried lightly, taking care they are not in the least browned, 
dust a little sdt and flour over them; then add some veal 
jelly to the water in which they were blanched; let them boil 
about three quarters of an hour in that liquor, skimming off 
all the butter, and scum very cleanly ; then take out the 
chicken, leaving the sauce or liquor, and lay it in another 
stewpan, which place in a basin of hot water near the fire. 
Boil down the sauce or liquor, adding some more veal jelly, 
till it becomes strong, and there remains sufficient sauce for 
the dish ; add to this the yolk of four eggs and three table- 
spoonfuls of cream : boil it, taking great care to keep it con- 



162 POULTRY. 

stantly stirring ; and, when ready to serve, having placed the 
chicken in a very hot dish, with the hreast in the middle, and 
the legs around, pour the sauce well over every part. The 
sauce should he thicker than melted hutter, and of a yellow 
colour. 

Chicken, to fricassee. No. 2. 
Cut the chicken up in joints ; put them into cold water, and 
set them on the fire till they boil ; skim them well. Save the 
liquor. Skin, wash, and trim the joints ; put them into a pan, 
with the liquor, a small bunch of parsley and th3rme, a small 
onion, and as much flour and water as will give it a proper 
thickness, and let them boil tiU tender. When going to table, 
put in a yolk of egg mixed with a little good cream, a little 
parsley chopped very fine, juice of lemon, and pepper and 
salt to your taste. 

Chicken, to fricassee. No. 3. 
Take two chickens and more than half stew them ; cut them 
into limbs ; take the skin clean off, and all the inside that is 
bloody. Put them into a stewpan, with half a pint of cream, 
about two ounces of butter, into which shake a little flour, 
some mace, and whole pepper, and a little parsley boiled and 
chopped fine. Thicken it up with the yolks of two eggs ; add 
the juice of a lemon, and three spoonfuls of good white gravy. 

Chicken, to fricassee. No. 4. 
Have a fiying-pan, with sufficient liquor to cover your 
chicken cut into pieces ; half of the liquor to be white wine 
and water. Take one nutmeg sliced, half a dozen cloves, 
three blades of mace, and some whole pepper ; boil all these 
together in a frying-pan ; put half a pound of fresh butter and 
skim it clean ; then put in your chickens, and boil them till 
tender ; add a small quantity of parsley. Take four yolks and 
two whites of eggs; beat them well with some thick butter, 
and put it to your chicken in the pan ; toss it over a slow fire 
till liiick, and serve it up with sippets. 

Chicken, white fricassee of 
Cut in pieces chickens or rabbits ; wash and dry them in a 
cloth ; flour them well, and fry in clarified butter till they are 
a little brown, but, if not enough done, put them in a stewpan, 
and just cover them with strong veal or beef broth. Put in 
with them a bunch of thyme, an onion stuck with cloves, a 
little pepper and salt, and a blade of mace. Cover and stew 
till tender, and till the liquor is reduced about one half. Put 
in a quarter of a pound of butter, the yolk of two eggs beat. 



POULTRY. 163 

and a quarter of a pint of cream. Stir well ; let it boil ; if 
not thick enough, shake in some flour ; and then put in juice 
of lemon. 

Cream of Chicken, or Fowl. 
For this purpose fowls are preferable, because the breasts are 
larger. Take two chickens, cut off the breast, and roast them; 
the remidnder put in a stewpan with-two pounds of the sinewy 
part of a knuclde of veal. Boil the whole together to make a 
little clear good broth : when the breasts are roasted, and your 
broth made, take all the white of the breast, put it in a smaU 
stewpan, and add to it the broth clean and clear. It will be 
better to cut the white of the chickens quite fine, and, when 
you find that it is boiled soft, proceed in the same manner as 
for cream of rice and pass it. Just in the same way, make it 
of the thickness you judge proper, and warm in the same manner 
as the cream of rice: put in a little salt if it is approved of. 

Chickens, to fry. 

Scald and split them ; put them in vinegar and water, as 
much as will cover them, with a little pepper and salt, an onion, 
a slice or two of lemon, and a sprig or two of thyme, and let 
them lie two hours in the pickle. Dry them with a cloth ; 
flour and fry them in clarified butter, with soft bread and a 
little of the pickle. 

Chickens, to heat. 

Take the legs, wings, brains, and rump, and put them into a 
little white wine vinegar and claret, with some fresh butter, 
the water of an onion, a little pepper and sliced nutmeg, and 
heat them between two dishes. 

Chickens, dressed with Peas. 
Singe and truss your chickens ; boil one half and roast the 
other. Put them into a small saucepan, with a little water, a 
small piece of butter, a little salt, and a bundle of thyme and 
parsley. Set them on the fire, and put in a small lump of sugar. 
When they boil, set them over a slow fire to stew. Lay your 
boiled chickens in a dish ; put your peas over them ; then lay 
the roasted ones between, and send to table. 

Chicken and Ham, ragout of. 
Clear a chicken which has been dressed of all the sauce that 
may be about it. If it has been roasted, pare off the brown 
skin, take some soup, veal jelly, and cream, and a table-spoon- 
ful of mushrooms ; if pickled, wash them in several waters to 
take out the vinegar : put them in the jelly, and keep this sauce 



164 POULTRY. 

to heat up. Cut up the chicken, the wmgs and breast in ^des/ 
the merrythought also, and divide the legs. Heat the fowl up 
separately from the sauce in a little thin broth : prepare six or 
eight slices of ham stewed apart in brown gravy ; dip each 
piece of the fowl in the white sauce, and lay them in the middle of 
the dish with apiece of the ham alternately one beside another, 
taking care that as little of the white sauce as possible goes on 
the ham, to preserve its colour. Lay the legs one on each dide 
of the meat in the middle ; and pour the sauce in the middle, 
taking care not to pour it over liie ham. 

Chicken, or Ham and Vealpat^s. 

Cut up into small dice some of the white of the chicken, or 
the most delicate part of veal already dressed; take sufficient 
white sauce, with truffles, morels, and mushrooms, and heat 
it up to put in the pat^s. When ready, pour it amply into 
them, and serve up hot. 

Another. 

Take the white of a chicken or veal, cut it up in small dice; 
do the same with some ham or tongue ; warm it in a little 
broth, and take a good white sauce, such as is used for phea- 
sants, and heat it up thoroughly. 

Duck, to boil. 
Pour over it boiling milk and water, and let it lie for an hour 
or two. Then boil it gently for a full half hour in plenty of 
water. Serve with onion sauce. 

Duck, to boil, d. la Frangaise, 
To a pint of rich beef gravy put two dozen of roasted peeled 
chesnuts, with a few leaves of thyme, two small onions if Eigree- 
able, a race of ginger, and a little whole pepper. Lard a fine 
tame duck, and half roast it ; put it into the gravy ; let it 
stew ten minutes, and add a pint of port wine. When the 
duck is done, take it out; boil up your gravy to a proper 
thickness, but skim it very clean from the fat ; lay your duck 
in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Duck a la braise. 
Lard the duck ; lay a slice or two of beef at the bottom of 
the pan, and on these the duck, a piece of bacon, and some 
more beef sliced, an onion, a carrot, whole pepper, a slice 
of lemon, and a bimch of sweet-herbs. Cover this close, and 
set it over the fire for a few minutes, shaking in some flour : 
then pour in a quart of beef broth or boiling water, and a 



POULTRY, 165 

little heated red wine. Stew it for half an hour; strain 
the sauce, and skim it ; put to it some more wine if neces- 
sary, with cayenne, shalot, a little 'mint, juice of a lemon, 
and chopped tarragon. If agreeable to your taste, add arti- 
choke bottoms boiled and quartered. 

Duck, to hash. 
When cut in pieces, flour it; put it into a stewpan with 
some gravy, a little red wine, shalot chopped, salt and pepper; 
boil these; put in the duck ; toss it up, take out the lemon, and 
serve with toasted sippets. 

Duck, to stew with Cucumbers. 
Half roast the duck, and stew it as before. Slice some 
cucumbers and onions ; fry and drain them very dry ; put them 
to the duck, and stew all together. 

Duck, to stew with Peas. 

Half roast the duck, put it into some good gravy with a little 
mint and three or four sage-leaves chopped. Stew this half 
an hour ; thicken the gravy with a little flour; throw in half a 
pint of green peas boiled, or some celery, in which case omit 
the mint. 

Fowls, to fatten in a fortnight. 

Gather and dry, in proper season, nettle leaves and seed; beat 
them into powder, and make it into paste with flour, adding a 
little sweet olive-oil. Make this up into small crams : coop 
the birds up and feed them with it, giving them water in whidi 
barley has been boiled, and they will fatten in the above-men- 
tioned time. 

Fowl, to make tender. 

Pour down the throat of the fowl, about an hour before you 
kill it, a spoonful of vinegar, and let it run about again. "Wlien 
kiUed, hang it up in the feathers by the legs in a smoky chim- 
ney ; then pluck and dress it. This method makes fowls very 
tender. 

Fowl, to roast with Anchovies, 

Put a bit of butter in your stewpan with a little flour; keep 
stirring this over the fire, but not too hot, till it turns of a 
good gold colour, and put a little of it into your gravy to 
thicken it. 

Fowl with Rice, called Pilaw. 

Boil a pint of rice in as much water as will cover it. Put 
in with it some whole black pepper, a little salt, and half a dozen 
cloves, tied up in a bit of cloth. When the rice is tender take 



1 66 POULTRY. 

out the cloves and pepper, and stir in a piece of butter. Boil 
a fo w land a piece of bacon ; lay them in a dish, and cover them 
with the rice. Lay round the dish and upon the rice hard eggs 
cut in halves and quarters, and onions, first boiled and then 
fried. 

Fowl, to hash. 

Cut the fowl in pieces ; put it in some gravy, with a little cream, 
ketchup, or mushroom-powder, grated lemon-peel, a few 
oysters and their liquor, and a piece of butter mixed with flour. 
Keep stirring it till the butter is melted. Lay sippets in the 
dish. 

Fowl, to stew. 

Take a fowl, two onions, two carrots, and two turnips ; put 
one onion into the fowl, and cut all the rest into four pieces each. 
Add two or three bits of bacon or ham, a bay-leaf, and as much 
water as will prevent their burning when put into an earthen 
vessel ; cover them up close, and stew them for three hours and 
a half on a slow fire. Serve up hot or cold. 

Goose, to stuff. 
Having well washed your goose, dry it, and rub the inside 
with pepper and salt. Crumble some bread, but not too fine ; 
take a piece of butter and make it hot ; cut a middle-sized 
onion and stew in the butter. Cut the liver very small, and 
put that also in the butter for about a minute just to warm, 
and pour it over the head. It must then be mixed up with an 
e^^ and about two spoonfuls of cream, a little nutmeg, ginger, 
pepper and salt, and a small quantity of summer savory. 

Another way. 

Chop fine two ounces of onions, and an ounce of green sage 
leaves ; add four ounces of bread crumbs, the yolk and white 
of an Q^^, a little salt and pepper, and sometimes minced 
apples. 

Goose* s liver, to dress. 

When it is drawn, leave the gall sticking to it; lay it in fresh 
water for a day, and change the water several times. When 
you use it, wipe it dry, cut off the gall, and fry it in butter, which 
must be made very hot before the liver is put in : it must be 
whole and fried brown — no fork stuck in it. Serve with a 
little ketchup sauce. 

Pigeons, to boil. 

Chop sweet-herbs and bacon, with grated bread, butter, spice, 
and the yolk of an egg ; tie both ends of the pullets, and boil 
them. Garnish with sliced lemon and barberries. 



POULTRY. 167 

Pig-eons, to broil. 
Cut their necks and wings close, leaving the skin of the neck 
to enahle you to tie close, and with some grated bread put an 
anchovy, the two livers of pigeons, half a grated nutmeg, a 
quarter of a pound of butter, a very little thyme, a little pep- 
per and salt, and sweet marjoram shred. Mix all togetiier, 
and into each bird put a piece of the size of a walnut, after 
sewing up the vents and necks, and, with a little nutmeg, pep-

fire, basting and turning very often. Use rich gravy or melted 
butter for sauce, and season to your taste. 

Pigeons, to jug. 

Pick and draw the pigeons, and let a little water pass through 
them ; parboil and bruise the liver with a spoon ; mix pepper, 
salt, grated nutmeg, parsley shred fine, and lemon-peel, suet 
cut small, in quantity equal to the liver, the yolks of two eggs 
boiled hard and also cut fine; mix these with two raw eggs, 
and stuff the birds, tying up the necks and vents. After dip- 
ping the pigeons into water, season them with salt and pepper; 
then put them into a jug, with two or three pieces of celery, 
stopping it very close, to prevent the steam escaping. Set 
them in a kettle of cold water ; lay a tile on the top, and boil 
three hours ; take them out, and put in a piece of butter rolled 
in flour ; shake it round till thick, and pour it over the 
pigeons. 

Pigeons, to pot. 

Truss and season them with savoury spice ; put them into a 
a pot or pan, covering them with butter, and bake them. Take 
out, drain, and, when cold, cover them with clarified butter. 
Fish may be potted in the same way, but always bone them 
when ba^ed. 

Pigeons, to stew. No. 1. 

Truss your pigeons as for boiling. Take pepper, salt, cloves, 
mace, some sweet-herbs, a little grated bread, and the liver of 
the birds chopped very fine; roll these up in a bit of butter, put 
it in the stomach of the pigeons, and tie up both ends. Make 
some butter hot in your stewpan, fiy the pigeons in it till they 
are brown all over, putting to them two or three blades of mace, 
a few peppercorns, and one shalot. Take them out of the liquor, 
dust a little flour into the stewpan, shaking it about till it is 
brown. Have ready a quart of small gravy and a glass of white 
wine ; let it just boil up : strain out all tiie spice, and put the 
g^vy and pigeons into the stewpan. Let them simmer over

the fire two hours; put in some pickled mushrooms, a 
little lemon juice, a spoonful of ketchup, a few truffles and 
morels. Dish and send to table with bits of bacon grilled. 
Some persons add forcemeat balls, but they are very rich 
without. 

Pigeons, to stew. No, 2. 
Shred the livers and gizzards, with as much suet as there is 
meat; season with pepper, salt, parsley, and thyme, shred small; 
fill the pigeons with this stuffing ; lay them in the stewpan, 
breasts downward, with as much strong broth as wiU cover 
them. Add pepper, salt, and onion, and two thin rashers of 
bacon. Cover them close ; let them stew two hours or more, 
till the liquor is reduced to one half, and looks like gravy, and 
the pigeons are tender ; then put them in a dish with sippets. 
If you have no strong broth, you may stew in water ; but you 
must not put so much water as broth, and they must stew 
more slowly. 

Pigeons, to stew. No. 3. 
Cut six pigeons with giblets into quarters, and put them 
into a stewpan, with two blades of mace, salt, pepper, and just 
water sufficient to stew them without burning. When tender, 
thicken the liquor with the yolk of an egg and three spoonfuls 
of fresh cream, a little shred thyme, parsley, and a bit of but- 
ter. Shake all together, and garnish with lemon. 

Pigeons, biscuit of. 
Wash, clean, and parboil, your pigeons, and stew them in 
strong broth. Have a ragout made for them of strong gravy, 
with artichoke bottoms and onions, seasoning them with the 
juice of lemons, and lemons diced, truffles, mushrooms, morels, 
and bacon cut as for lard. Pour the broth into a dish with 
dried sippets, and, after placing your pigeons, pour on the 
ragout. Garnish with scalded parsley, lemons, and beet-root. 

Pigeons, en compote. No. 1. 
The pigeons must be young and white, and the inside entirely 
taken out. Let none of the heart or liver remain, which is 
apt to render them bitter. Make some forcemeat of veal, and 
fill the pigeons with it ; then put them in a braise, with some 
bacon, a slice of lemon, a little thyme, and bay-leaf, and let 
them stew gently for an hour. The sauce is made of cucum- 
bers and mushrooms, and they must be sweated in a little 
butter till tender ; then strain it off the butter, and put in some 
strong gravy and a little flour to thicken it. Lastly, add the 



POULTRY. 169 

yolks of two eggs and a little good cream, which, when put 
to it, must be well stirred, and not suffered to boil, as it would 
curdle and spoil the sauce. 

Pigeons, en compote. No. 2. 

Have the birds trussed with their legs in their bodies, but 
stuffed with forcemeat ; parboil and lard them with fat bacon ; 
season with pepper, spices, parsley, and minced chives ; stew them 
very gently. While they are stewing, make a ragout of fowls' 
livers, cocks'-combs, truffles, morels, and mushrooms, and put 
a little bacon in the frying-pan to melt ; put them in, and shake 
the pan three or four times round ; then add some rich gravy, 
and let it simmer a little, and put in some veal cullis and ham 
to thicken it. Drain the pigeons, and put them into this ragout; 
Jet them just simmer ; take them up, put them into your dish, 
and pour the ragout over. 

Pigeons, en compote. No. 3. 

Lard, truss, and force them ; season and stew them in strong 
broth. Have a ragout garnished with sippets, sweetbreads, 
and sprigs of parsley ; then fry the pigeons in a batter of eggs 
and sliced bacon. You may garnish most dishes in the same 
way. 

Pigeons, h la Crapaudine, 

Cut the birds open down the back, and draw the legs through 
the skin inside, as you would do a boiled fowl, then put into a 
roomy saucepan some butter, a little parsley, thyme, shalots, 
and, if you can have them, mushrooms, all chopped together 
very fine. Put the pigeons in this, and let them sweat in the 
butter and herbs for about five minutes. While they are warm 
-and moist with the herbs and butter, cover them all over with 
fiiie bread crumbs ; sprinkle a little salt upon them> and boil 
them on a slow fire. The sauce may be either of mushrooms 
or'cucumbers, made by sweating whichever you choose in butter 
till quite tender, then adding a little gravy, cream, and flour. 

Pigeons in disguise. 
Draw, truss, and season the pigeons with salt and pepper, 
and make a nice puff; roll each pigeon in a piece of it ; tie them 
in a cloth, but be careful not to let the paste break. Boil them 
in plenty of water for an hour and a half; and when you untie 
them take great care they do not break ; put them into a dish, 
and pour a little good gravy to them.

a little lemon-pickle, a tea-spoonful of walnut ketchup, cayenne, 
a little salt, a few truffles, morels, and some yolks of hard eggs. 
Pour your sauce with its ingredients over the pigeons, when 
laid in the dish. 

Pigeons aux Poires. 
Let the feet be cut off, and stuff them with forcemeat, in the 
shape of a pear, rolling them in the yolk of an egg and crumbs 
of bread, putting in at the lower end to make them look like 
pears. Rub your dish with a piece of butter, and then lay them 
over it, but not to touch each other, and bake them. When 
done, lay them in another dish, and pour some good gravy into 
it, thickening with the yolk of an egg ; but take care not to 
pour it over the pigeons. 

Another way. 

Cut off one leg ; truss the j)igeons to boil, and let the leg come 
out of the vent ; fill them with forcemeat : tie them with pack- 
thread, and stew them in good broth. Roll the pigeons in yolks 
of eggs, well beaten with crumbs of bread. Lard your stewpan, 
but not too hot, and fry your birds to the colour of ji popling 
pear ; lay them in a dish, and send up gravy and orange in a 
terrine with them. 

Pigeons, Pompeton of. 

Butter your pan, lay in it some sliced bacon, and cover all 
the inside of it with forcemeat. Brown the pigeons off in a 
pan, aiid put them in a good ragout, stewing them up together, 
and put also a good ladleful of ragout to the forcemeat : then 
lay your pigeons breast downward, and pour over them the 
ragout that "remains; cover them with forcemeat, and bake 
them. Turn them out, and serve up. 

Pigeons an SoleiL 
Make some forcemeat, with half a pound of veal, a quarter 
of a pound of mutton, and two ounces of beef, and beat them 
in a mortar with salt, pepper, and mace, till they become 
paste. Beat up the yolks of four eggs, put them into a plate, 
and mix two ounces of flour and a quarter of a pound of 
grated bread. Set on your stewpan with a little rich beef 
gravy ; tie up three or four cloves in a piece of muslin, and put 
into it ; then put your pigeons in, and stew them till nearly 
done ; set them before tiie fire to keep warm, and with some 
good beef dripping in your pan, enough to cover the birds, 
set it on the fire ; when boiling, take one at a time, and roll 
it in the meat that was beaten, then in the yolk of an egg.

Pigeons d la Tatare, with Cold Sauce, 
Singe and truss the pigeons as for boiling, and beat them 
flat, but not so as to break the skin ; season them with salt, 
pepper, cloves, and mace. Dip them in melted butter and 
grated bread ; lay them on a gridiron, and turn them often. 
Should the fire not be clear, lay them upon a sheet of paper 
buttered, to keep them from being smoked. For sauce, take a 
piece of onion or shalot, an anchovy, and two spoonfuls of 
pickled cucumbers, capers, and mushrooms : mince these very 
small by themselves ; add a little pepper and salt, five spoon- 
fuls of oil, one of water, and the juice of a lemon, and mix 
them well together with mustard. Pour the sauce cold into 
the dish, and lay the birds, when broiled, upon it.

mortar; mix these with some mushrooms, a little chopped 
parsley, a clove of garlic shred fine, two or three young onions 
minced fine, a sweetbread of veal, parboiled and minced very 
fine, pepper, and salt. Fill the pigeons with this stuffing ; tie 
them close, and cover each pigeon with the forcemeat : tie 
them up in paper to keep it on, and while roasting have some 
essence of ham heated ; pour it into your dish, and lay your 
pigeons upon it. 

To preserve tainted Poultry, 

Have a large cask that has been just emptied, with part of a 
stave or two knocked out at the head, and into the others 
drive hooks to hang your fowls, but not so as to touch one 
another, covering the open places with the staves or boards 
already knocked out, but leaving the bung-hole open as an air 
vent. Let them dry in a cool place, and in this way you may 
keep fish or flesh.

all round, put them in a stewpan, with a little jelly gravy, just 
to cover them ; heat them thoroughly, taking care they do not 
bum ; strain off the gravy, and leave the partridge in the pan 
away from the fire, covering the pan. Take a large onion,^ 
three or four slices of ham, free from all fat, one carrot, cut in 
dice, a dessert- spoonful of mushrooms, clear washed from vine- 
gar if they are pickled, two cloves, a little parsley and thyme,

very fine, but not pounded in a mortar, which would spoil it. 
Season with mace, pepper, salt, a very little shalot, and lemon- 
peel. Put the whole into a stewpan ; keep it stirred ; add three 
eggs ; have a raised crust, and lay thin slices of good fat bacon 
at the bottom and all round. 

Pheasant, to boil. 
Boil the birds in abundance of water ; if they are large, they 
will require three quarters of an hour ; if small, about half an

hour. For sauce — stewed white celery, thickened with cresnn^ 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour ; pour this over them. 

Pheasant, with white sauce. 
Truss the bird with the legs inward, (like a fowl for boil- 
ing) ; singe it well ; take a little butter and the fat of some 
bacon, and fry the pheasant white ; when sufficiently firm, take 
it out of the pan ; then put a spoonful of flour into the butter ; 
fry this flour white ; next add a pint of veal or game jelly ; put 
in a few mushrooms, if pickled to be well washed ; cut small a 
bunch of parsley, a large onion, a little thyme, one clove, a 
pinch of salt, cayenne pepper, and a small lump of sugar ; 
stew the bird in this sauce till done ; this may be known by 
putting a fork into the flesh, and seeing that no blood issues 
out ;• then skim off the fat and drain the pheasant ; then strain 
and boil the gravy in which it has been stewed ; have ready a 
few mushrooms fried white in butter ; then thicken the gravy 
with the yolk of four eggs and two table-spoonfuls of cream, 
throw in the mushrooms, place the pheasant in a hot dish, pour 
the sauce over it, and serve it up. 

Pheasant d, la Braise, 
Put a layer of beef, the same of veal, at the bottom of the 
stewpan, with'a thin slice of bacon, a little bit of carrot, an onion 
stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet-herbs, some black and white 
pepper, and a little beaten mace, and put in your pheasant ; 
put over it a layer of veal and the same of beef ; set it on 
the fire for five or six minutes ; then pour two quarts of boiling 
water, cover it down close, and put a damp cloth round the out- 
side of the cover to prevent the steam escaping : it must stew 
gently for an hour and a half ; then take up the pheasant and 
keep it hot, and let the gravy stew till reduced to about a pint ; 
strain it off, and put it into a saucepan, with a sweetbread, 
which must have been stewed with the bird, some liver of 
fowls, morels, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and the tops of as- 
paragus, and let these simmer in the gravy ; add two spoonfuls 
of red wine and of ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour ; 
let them stew for five or six minutes : lay the pheasant in the 
dish, pour the ragout over it, and lay forcemeat balls round it. 

Pheasant d Vltalienne, 
Cut the liver small : and to one bird take but six oysters ; 
parboil them, and put them into a stewpan with the liver, a piece 
of butter, some parsley, green onions, pepper and salt, sweet- 
herbs, and a little allspice ; let them stand a little over the fire. 



GAME. 181 

and stuff the pheasant with them ; then put it into a stewpan, 
with some oil, green onions, sweet basil, parsley, and lemon 
juice, for a few minutes ; take them off, cover your pheasant 
with slices of bacon, and put it upon a spit, tying some paper 
round it while roasting. Then take some oysters, and stew them 
in their own liquor a little, and put in your stewpan four yolks 
of eggs, half a lemon cut in dice, a little beaten pepper, scraped 
nutmeg, parsley cut small, an anchovy cut small, a rocambole, 
a little oil, a small glass of white wine, a little of ham cullis ; 
put the sauce over the fire to thicken, then put in the oysters, 
and make the sauce relishing, and, when the pheasant is done, 
lay it in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Pheasant, Pur4 of. 
Chop the fleshy parts of a pheasant, the wings, breast, and 
legs, very fine, and pound them well in a mortar. Warm a 
pint of veal jelly, and stew the bird in it. Strain the whole 
through a sieve. Mix it all to the consistency of mashed po- 
tatoes. Serve in a dish with fried bread round it. 

Widgeon, to dress. 
To eat widgeon in perfection, half roast the birds. When 
they come to table, slice the breast, strew on pepper and salt, 
pour on a little red wine, and squeeze the juice of an orange 
or lemon over ; put some gravy to this ; set the plate on a lamp ; 
cut up the bird ; let it remain over the lamp till enough done, 
turning it. A widgeon will take nearly twenty minutes to 
roast, to eat plain with good gravy only. 

Wild Duck, to roast. 
It will take full twenty minutes — gravy sauce to eat with it. 

Woodcocks and Snipes, to roast. 
Twenty minutes will roast the woodcocks, and fifteen the 
snipes. Put under either, while roasting, a toast to receive the 
trail, which lay under them in the dish. Melted butter, and 
good gravy for sauce. 

Woodcocks (i la Fran^aise. 
Pick them, then draw and truss them ; let their breasts be 
larded with broad pieces of bacon ; roast and serve them up on 
toasts dipped in verjuice. 

Woodcocks, to pot. 
The same as you pot pigeons. 



SAUCES. 



Essence of Anchovies, 

Take two pounds of anchovies, one ounce of bay salt, three 
pints of spring water, half a gill of red port, half a gill mush- 
room ketchup; put them into a saucepan until the anchovies 
are all dissolved ; let them boil ; strain off the liquor with a 
one hair sieve, and be careful not to cork it imtil it is quite 
cold. 

Anchovy Pickle. 

Take two poimds of bay salt, three quarters of a poimd of 
saltpetre, three pints of spring water, and a very little bole 
armeniac, to grate on the liquor to give it a colour ; it must 
not be put to the anchovies until it is cold. 

If anchovies are quite dry, put them into a jar, with a layer 
of bay salt at the bottom, and a little on the top. 

Anchovy Sauce. 

Take one or two anchovies ; scale, split, and put them into 
a saucepan, with a little water, or good broth, a spoonful of 
vinegar, and a small round onion. When the anchovy is quite 
dissolved, strain off the liquor, and put into your melted butter 
to your taste. 

To recover Anchovies. 

When anchovies have, through the loss of the pickle, become 
rusty or decayed, put two pounds of saltpetre to a gallon of 
water, and boil it till reduced to a fourth part, continuing to 
skim it as it rises ; then add a quarter of an ounce of crystal 
tartar ; mix these, and stir them well. Take away the spoiled 
fish, put them together lightly, and pour in the new pickle, 
mixed with a pint of good old pickle, and stop them up close 
for twenty-four days. When you open tliem again, cover them 



] 84 ' SAUCES. 

with fine beaten bay salt ; let them remain about four days ; 
and, as you take them out for use, cover them carefully down. 

Bacchanalian Sauce, 

Take a spoonful of sweet oil, a gill of good broth, and a pint 
of white wine vinegar, adding two glasses of strong white 
wine : boil them together till half is consumed ; then put in 
some shalot, garden cresses, tarragon, chervil, parsley, and 
scallions, all shred very fine, with some large pepper. Let the 
whole boil up, and serve it. A little cullis added will improve 
it. 

Bechamel, or White Sauce. No. 1. 

Take half a quarter of a pound of butter, three pounds of 
veal, cut into small slices, a quarter of a pound of ham, some 
trimmings of mushrooms, truffles, and morels, two white 
onions, a bunch of parsley, and thyme, put the whole into a 
stewpan, and set it on the fire till the meat is made firm ; then 
put in three spoonfuls of flour, moistened with boiling hot thin 
cream. Keep this sauce rather thin, so that while you reduce 
it the ingredients may have time to be stewed thoroughly. 
Season with a little salt and cayenne pepper, and strain it 
through a sieve. This is excellent for pouring over roast veal 
instead of butter, and is a good sauce for hashed veal, for any 
white meat, and for all sorts of vegetables. 

Bechamel, No. 2. 

Two pounds of lean veal, cut in square pieces, half an inch 
thick ; half a pound of lean ham. Melt in your stewpan two 
ounces of butter; simmer it until nearly ready to catch the 
stewpan, which must be avoided : add three table-spoonfuls of 
flour. When well mixed, add three pints of broth, or water, 
pouring in a little at a time that the thickening may be smooth. 
Stir till it boils ; set it on the comer of the hob to boil gently 
for two hours. Season with an onion, twelve peppercorns, a 
few mushrooms, a faggot of parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a 
bay-leaf. Let the sauce be reduced to a quart ; skim off the 
fat ; and strain through a tamis. 

Bechamel, No. 3. 

Proceed much in the same way as for the brown sauce, (see 
Cullis) only it is not to be drawn down brown, but filled up 
and thickened with flour and water, some good cream added 
to it, and then strained. 

Sauce for Beef Bouilli. 

Four hard eggs well mixed up with half a table-spoonful of 
made mustard, eight capers, and one table spoonful of Read- 
ing sauce. 



SAUCES. 185 

Sauce for boiled Beef ci la Russe. 
Scrape a large stick of horseradish, tie it up in a cloth, and 
boil it with the beef ; when boiled a little, put it into some 
melted butter ; boil it some time, and send it up in the butter. 
Some persons like to have it sent up in vinegar. 

Bread Sauce, No. 1. 
Put into half a pint of water a good sized piece of bread- 
crumb, not new, with an onion, a blade of mace, a few pepper- 
corns, in a bit of cloth ; boil them a few minutes ; take out the 
onion and spice, mash the bread smooth, add a little salt and 
a piece of butter. 

Bread Sauce, No. 2. 
Take a French roll, or white bread crumb ; set it on the fire, 
with some good broth or gravy, a small bag of pepp«*rcom8, 
and a small onion ; add a little good cream, and a little pepper 
and salt ; you may rub it through a sieve or not. 

Bread Sauce, No. 3. 
Take the crumb of a French roll ; put it into a saucepan, 
with two large onions, some white peppercorns, and about a 
pint of water. Let it boil over a slow fire till the onions are 
very tender ; then drain off the water ; rub the bread and 
onions through a hair sieve ; put the pulp into a stewpan, with 
a bit of butter, a little salt, and a gill of cream ; and keep it 
stirring till it boils. 

Bread Sauce, No. 4. 
Put bread crumbs into a stewpan with as much milk as will 
soak them ; moisten with broth ; add an onion and a few pep- 
percorns. Let it boil or simmer till it becomes stiflp : then add 
two table- spoonfuls of cream, melted butter, or good broth. 
Take out the onion and peppercorns when ready to serve. 

Bread Sauce for Pig, 
To the sauce made as directed in No. 1 add a few currants 
picked and washed, and boil them in it. 

Browning- for made dishes. 

Beat four ounces of loaf sugar very fine ; put it into an iron 

frying-pan, with an ounce of butter ; set it over a clear fire, 

mixing it well all the time : when it begins to be frothy, the 

sugar is dissolving ; hold it high over the fire. When the but- 



186 SAUCES. 

ter and sugar is of a deep brown, pour in a little white wine ; 
stir it weJl ; add a little more wine, stirring it all the- time. 
Put in the rind of a lemon, a little salt, three spoonfuls of mush- 
room ketchup, half an ounce of whole allspice, four shalots 
peeled; boil them slowly eight minutes, then pour into a basin, 
cover it close, and let it stand till next day. Skim and bottle 
it. A pint of white wine is the proper quantity for these 
ingredients. 

Another, 
Take some brown sugar, put a little water to it, set it on 
the fire, and let it boil till it nearly comes to burning, but it 
must not quite bum, as it would then be bitter: put some 
water to it, and when cold strain it off, and put it in a bottle. 
When you want to give a higher colour to gravy or sauce, you 
will find this very useful. 

, *^ Butter, to hum. 

'VxA your butter into a frying-pan over a slow fire; when it 
is melted, dust in some fiour, and keep stirring it till it is thick 
and brown : then thicken some with it. 

Butter, to clarify. 
Let it slowly melt and then stand a little ; and when it is 
poured into pots, leave the milk, which will settle at the bottom. 

Another way. 
Melt the butter, and skim it well before it is poured upon 
any thing. 

Plain melted Butter — very simple, but rarely well done. 

Keep either a plated or tin saucepan for the sole purpose of 

melting butter. Put into it a little water and a dust of flour, 

and shake them together. Cut the butter in slices ; as it melts, 

shake it one way ; let it boil up, and it will be smooth and thick. 

Another, 
Mix a little flour and water out of the dredger, that it may 
not be lumpy; then put in a piece of butter, set it over a quick 
fire ; have it on and off every instant to shake it, and it will not 
oil, but will become thick and smooth. 

To thicken Butter for Peas, SfC, 
Put two or three spoonfuls of water in a saucepan, sufficient 
to cover the bottom. When it boils, put half a pound of but- 
ter ; when it is melted, take off the saucepan, and shake it 
round a good while, till very smooth. 



SAUCES. 187

Carp Sauce. 

One pint of Lisbon wine, with a small quantity of mace, 
cloves, and cinnamon, three anchovies, a bit of bay-leaf, a little 
horseradish not scraped, and a slice or two of onion ; let the 
whole boil about a quarter of an hour, and, when cold, mix as 
much flour with the sauce as will make it of a proper thickness. ' 
Set it over the stove ; keep it stirred till it boils. Just before 
you serve up, put in a quarter of a pint of cream, more or less 
according to the thickness of your sauce. 

Boil the carp in as much water as will cover them, with 
some wine, a little vinegar, and slices of lemon and onion. 

Jnother. 
Four large anchovies, eight spoonfuls of white wine, four of 
vinegar, two onions, whole, a nutmeg quartered, some mace, 
whole pepper, two or three cloves ; boil it nearly half away, 
then strain it off, thicken it with butter and flour, and three 
spoonfuls of thick cream ; the sauce should not be too thick. 

Light brown Sauce /or Carp, 
To the blood of the carp put thyme, parsley, onions, and 
anchovies ; chop all these small, and put them together in a 
saucepan. Add half a pint of white wine, a quarter of a pint 
of elder vinegar, and a little tarragon vinegar : mix all these 
togetlier, set the pan on the fire, and boil till it is almost dry. 
Mix some melted butter with the sauce, and pour it on the fish, 
being plain boiled. 

Sauce for Carp and Tench, 
Boil a pint of strong gravy drawn from beef, with three or 
four anchovies, a smsdl bit of lemon-peel and horseradish, a 
little mushroom ketchup, and a great deal of black pepper.

Take six fine anchovies well washed and picked, put them in 
a stewpan, add to them four spoonfuls of vinegar, eight spoon- 
fuls of water, one large onion sliced, two or three blades of 
mace, and four or ^ve cloves. Let them stand one hour be- 
fore the sauce is wanted ; set them on the stove, and give them 
a boil up ; strain the liquor into a clean stewpan ; then add 
the yolks of four eggs well beaten ; put to it some good thick 
melted butter ; add half a pint of very nice thick cream. Mix 
all these well together ; put it on a slow fire ; stir it till it 
boils ; season to your taste. 

Carp Sauce, for Fish. 
Put a little lean bacon and some slices of veal at the bottom 
of a stewpan, with three or four pieces of carp, four anchovies, 
an onion, two shalots, and tarragon, or any root to flavour to

and, when it begins to thicken, or to stick to the pan, moisten 
it with a large glass of white wine, two spoonfuls of cullis, and 
the same quantity of broth. Skim and strain it through a 
sieve ; it will want no salt. 

Cavechi, an Indian Pickle. No. 1. 
This is excellent for sauce. Into a pint of vinegar put two 
cloves of garlic, two spoonfuls of red pepper, two large spoon- 
fuls of India soy, and four of walnut pickle, with as much co- 
chineal as will colour it, two dozen large anchovies boned and

Celery Sauce, white. 

Make some strong hoiled gravy, with veal, a good deal of 
spice, and sweet-herbs ; put these into a stewpan with celery 
cut into pieces of about two or three inches in length, ready 
boiled, and thicken it with three quarters of a pound of butter 
rolled in flour, and half a pint of cream. Boil this up, and 
squeeze in some lemon-juice ; pour some of it into the dish. 

This is an excellent sauce for boiled turkey, fowl, or veal. 
When the stufiing is made for turkey, make some of it into 
balls, and boil them. 

Celery Sauce, brown. 

Put the celery, cut into pieces about an inch long, and the 
onions sliced, with a small lump of butter ; stew them on a slow 
fire till quite tender ; add two spoonfdls of flour, half a pint 
of veal or beef broth, salt, pepper, and a little milk or cream. 
Boil it a quarter of an hour. 

Sauce for boiled Chickens, 

Take the yolks of four eggs, three anchovies, a little of the 
middle of bacon, and the inside of half a lemon ; chop them 
all very fine ; add a little thyme and sweet marjoram ; tiiicken 
them all well together with butter, and pour it over the 
chickens. 

Another, 

Shred some anchovies very fine, with the livers of the chick- 
ens and some hard eggs ; take a little of the boiling water in 
which the chickens were boiled, to melt the butter. Add some 
lemon juice, with a little of the peel cut small. 

Sauce for cold Chicken or Game, 
Chop a boned anchovy or two, some parsley, and a small 
onion; add pepper, oil, vinegar, mustard, and ketchup, and 
mix them all together.

vinegar, one small onion, one dozen cloves : thicken it with 
flour and butter ; rub it through a sieve, and add a table- 
spoonful of sherry. 

Consomme. 
To make this foundation of all sauces, take knuckle of veal 
and some new ham. One pound of ham will be sulficient for 



190 SAUCES. 

six pounds of veal, with onions and roots of difiierent sorts, 
and draw it down to a light colour : fill up with beef broth, if 
there is not enough. When the scum rises, skim it well, and 
let it simmer gently for three or four hours, keeping it well 
skimmed. Strain it off for use. 

Cream Sauce for White Dishes. 
Put a bit of butter into a stewpan, with parsley, scallions, 
and shalots, the whole shred fine, and a clove of garlic entire ; 
turn it a few times over the fire ; shake in some flour, and 
moisten it with two or three spoonfuls of good cream. Boil 
it a quarter of an hour, strain off the sauce, and, when you are 
ready to use it, put in a little good butter, with some parsley 
parboiled and chopped very fine, salt, and whole pepper, 
thickening it over the fire. 

Cullis, to thicken Sauces, 

Take carrot, turnip, onion ; put them in the bottom of a 
stewpan ; slice some veal and ham, and lay over your carrot, 
with thyme, parsley, and seasoning ; put this over a fire gently ; 
when it sticks to ihe bottom, pour in some good stock, put in 
the crum of some French rolls, boil them up together, strain 
it through a sieve, and rub the bread through; this will 
thicken any brown sauce. 

Fish culiis must be as above, only with fish instead of meat. 

Brown Culiis, 

Take two pounds of veal and half a pound of ham, with two 
or three onions ; put a little bit of butter in the bottom of 
your stewpan, and lay in it the veal and ham cut small, with 
the onions in slices, a little of the spices of different sorts, 
and a small piece of bay leaf. Let it stew gently over the 
stove until it comes to a fine colour ; then fill it up with broth, 
but, if you have no broth, with water; then make some 
smooth flour and water, and put it to it, until you find it thick 
enough : let it boil gently half an hour ; skim the grease from 
it, and strain it. 

Another, 

Put a piece of butter in a stewpan ; set it over a fire with 
some flour to it ; keep it stirring till it is of a good colour; 
then put some gravy to it ; this culiis will thicken any sauce. 

Culiis cL la Reine, or Queen's Stock, 
Cut some veal into thin slices ; beat them, and lay them in 
a stewpan, with some slices of ham ; cut a couple of onions 



SAUCES. 191 

small, and put them in ; cut to pieces half a dozen mushrooms 
and add them to the rest, with a bunch of parsley ; and set 
them on a very gentle stove fire to stew. When they are 
quite done, and the liquor is rich and high tasted, take out all 
the meat, and put in some grated bread ; boil up once, stirring 
them thoroughly. 

Turkey Cullis. 
Roast a large turkey till it is brown ; cut it in pieces ; put 
it into a marble mortar, with some ham, parsley, chives, mush- 
rooms, a handful of each, and a crust of bread ; beat them up 
into a paste. Take it out, and put it into a deep stewpan, with 
a pint of veal broth ; stir it all well together ; cover it, and 
set it over the stove; turn it constantly, adding more veal 
broth. When thoroughly dissolved, pass it through a hair 
sieve, and keep it for use. It will give any sauce a fine 
flavour ; but cullises are generally used for the sorts of meat 
of which they are made. Some of the above, for instance, 
would make an excellent sauce for a turkey, added to any 
other gravy ; then put them over a slow fire to stew gently. 
Take the flesh of a fine fowl, already roasted, from the bones ; 
beat it in a marble mortar ; add this to the cullis in the stew- 
pan. Stir it well together, but take great care that it does 
not boil ; pound three dozen of sweet almonds blanched to a 
thin paste, in a marble mortar, with a little boiled milk ; add 
it to the cullis, and, when the whole is dissolved, it is fit for 
use. This is good for all white sauces and white soups. 

Cullis of Vealy or any other Meat, 
Put some small pieces of veal into a stewpan, with the like 
quantity of ham, about a pound to a quarter of a pint of water. 
Stew gently with onions and different herbs, till all the juice 
of the meat 'is extracted ; then boil it quicker, till it begins to 
stick to the dish. Take the meat and vegetables out of the 
pan ; add a little butter and flour to the gravy ; boil it till it 
becomes of a good colour ; then add, if you like, some good 
broth ; put the meat in again to simmer for two hours ; skim 
it well ; strain through a sieve, and keep it for use. 

Dandy Sauce, for all sorts of Poultry and Game. 
Put a glass of white wine into a stewpan, with half a lemon 
cut in slices, a little rasped bread, two spoonfuls of oil, a 
bunch of parsley and scallions, a handful of mushrooms, a 
clove of garlic, a little tarragon, one clove, three spoonftils 
of rich cullis, and a thin slice of fine smoked ham. Let the

whole boil together till it is of a fine rich consistency ; pass it 
through the sieve ; then give it another turn over the fire, and 
serve it up hot. 

Devonshire Sauce, 
Cut any quantity of young walnuts into small pieces; sprinkle 
a little salt on them ; next day, pound them in a mortar and 
squeeze the juice through a coarse thin cloth, such as is used 
for cheese. To a pint of juice add a pound of anchovies, and 
boil them slowly till the anchovies are dissolved. Strain it ; 
add half a pint of white wine vinegar, half an ounce of mace, 
half an ounce of cloves, and forty peppercorns ; boil it a 
quarter of an hour, and, when cold, rack it off and bottle it. A 
quarter of a pint of vinegar put to the dregs that have been 
strained off, and well boiled up, makes an excellent seasoning 
for the cook's use in hashes, fish sauce, &c. 

Sauce for Ducks. 

Stew the giblets till the goodness is extracted, with a small 
piece of lean bacon, either dressed or not, a little sprig of 
lemon-thyme, some parsley, three or four sage leaves, a small 
onion quartered, a few peppercorns, and plenty of lemon-peel. 
Stew all these well together ; strain and put in a large spoon- 
ful of port wine, a little cayenne pepper and butter, and flour 
it to thicken. 

Dutch Sauce, 

Put into a saucepan some vinegar and water with a piece of 
butter ; thicken it with the yolks of two eggs ; squeeze into 
it the juice of a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. 

Dutch Sauce for Fish, 

Slice a little horseradish, and put it into a quarter of a pint 
of water, with five or six anchovies, half a handful of white 
peppercorns, a small onion, half a bay-leaf, and a very little 
lemon peel, cut as thin as possible. Let it boil a quarter of 
an hour ; then strain and thicken with flour and butter and the 
yolk of an egg. Add a little elder vinegar, and then squeeze 
it through a tamis. It must not boil after being strained, or 
it will curdle. 

Dutch Sauce for Meat or Fish. 

Put two or three table-spoonfuls of water, as many of vine- 
gar, and as many of broth, into a saucepan, with a piece of 
butter ; thicken it with the yolks of two eggs. If for fish, add 
four anchovies ; if not, leave them out. Squeeze into it the 
juice of a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. 



SAUCES. 19^ 

Dutch Sauce for Trout, 

Put into a stewpan a tea-spoonful of flour, four of vinegar, 
a quarter of a pound of butter, the yolks of ^"vq eggs, and a 
little salt. Set it on the fire, and keep continually stirring. 
When thick enough, work it well that you may refine it ; pass 
it through a sieve ; season with a little cayenne pepper, and 
serve up. 

Egg Sauce, 

Take two or three eggs, or more if you like, and boil them 
hard ; chop the whites first and then the yolks with them, and 
put them into melted butter. 

The Exquisite. 

Put a little cullis into a stewpan, with a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut rolled in twice as much flour, salt, and large 
pepper, the yolks of two eggs, three or four shalots cut smafi,

thick, is to be spread over meat or fish, which is afterwards 
isovered with finely grated bread, and browned with a hot 
salamander.

One pound of anchovies, stripped from the salt, and rinsed 
in a little port wine, a quarter of an ounce of mace, twelve 
cloves, two races of ginger sliced, a small onion or shalot, a 
small sprig of thyme, and winter savory, put into a quart of 
port wine, and half a pint of vinegar. Stew them over a slow 
fire covered close ; strain the liquor through a hair sieve, cover 
it till cold, and put it in dry bottles. By adding a pint of port 
wine and the wine strained that the anchovies were rinsed in

quarter of a pound of butter, without flour and water, and let 
it boil.

thyme, parsley, sliced horseradish, and seasoning ; boil these 
together. Strain off the liquor ; put into it a bit of thickening

Fish Sauce. No. 10. 
Boil a bit of horseradish and anchovy in gravy with a little 
lemon-peel and mace ; add some cream ; thicken it with flour

Fish Sauce. No. 11. 
Boil a piece or two of horseradish in gravy ; put into it a 
bit of mace and lemon-peel ; add a little anchovy, either before 
or after it has been boiled ; thicken with cream, and add a

savory and thyme, and three or four onions, a piece of garlic, 
and one shalot. Stew all these over a slow fire for an hour ; 
then strain the liquor through a coarse sieve, and bottle it. 
You may stew the ingredients over again with more wine and 
vinegar for present use. When you use it, it must be put into 
tile saucepan with the butter, instead of water, and melt it toge- 
ther. If you keep it close stopped, it will be good many years.

White Sauce, with Capers and Anchovies, for any White Fish. 
Put a bit of butter, about the size of an egg, rolled in flour, 
into a stewpan ; dilute it with a large wine glass of veal broth, 
two anchovies, cut fine, minced parsley, and two spoonfuls of 
cream. Stew it slowly, till it is of the proper consistency.

Forcemeat Balls, for Sauces. 
To make forcemeat balls for soups, without grease, com- 
monly called quenelles, soak the crumb of two penny rolls in 
milk for about half an hour ; take it out, and squeeze out the 
milk ; put the bread into a stewpan, with a little white sauce, 
made of veal jelly, a little butter, flour, and cream, seasoned, 
a spoonful of beef or mutton jelly, some parsley, shalots, and 
thyme, minced very fine. Stew these herbs in a little butter, 
to take off their rawness. Set them to reduce the panada of 
bread and milk, which you must keep constantly stirring with 
a wooden spoon, when the panada begins to get dry in the pan, 
which prevents its sticking ; when quite firm, take it from the 



SAUCES. 197 

fire, and mix with it the yolks of two eggs. Let it cool, and 
use when wanted. 

This panada must always he prepared heforehand, in order 
to have it cold, for it cannot be used warm ; when cold, roll it 
into balls, but let them be smaU ; pound the whole as large as 
possible in a mortar, for the more they are pounded the more 
delicate they are. Then break two eggs, and pound them like- 
wise ; season with a pinch of cayenne pepper, salt, and spices, 
in powder. When the whole is well mixed together, try a 
small bit, rolling it with a little flour, then putting it into 
boiling water wi& a little salt ; if it should not be firm enough, 
add another egg, without beating the white. When the whole 
is mixed once more, rub it through a sieve, roll it into balls, 
and serve up hot in sauces. 

White Sauce, for Fowls,

boiling hot cream, the yolks of three eggs, a pinch of cayenne 
pepper, and the same of salt ; boil all up together, till of a 
tolerable thickness ; keep it hot, and take care that it does not 
curdle. Make ready some shoes of truffles, about thirty-four, 
the size and thickness of a shilling, boil them in a little meat 
jelly ; strain them, and add the trufl3es to the sauce previously 
made. When ready to serve, pour the sauce and truffles over 
whatever meat they are destined for. 

Sauce, for roasted Fowls of all kinds, or ^roasted Mutton. 
Cut some large onions jrAb square pieces ; cut some fat 
bacon in the same manner, and a slice of lean ham ; put them 
in a stewpan ; shake them round constantly, to prevent their 
burning. When they are of a fine brown colour, put in some 
good cullis, more or less, according to the quantity you want 



198 SAUCES. 

to make. Let them stew very gently, till the onions are ten- 
der ; then put in two tea-spoonfuls of mustard, and one table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Serve it hot. 

A very good general Sauce. 
Take some mint, balm, basil, thyme, parsley, and sage; 
pick them from the stalks, cut them very fine, slice two large 
onions very thin ; then put all the ingredients into a marble 
mortar, and beat them till they are quite mixed ; add some 
cayenne pepper and salt ; beat aU these well together, and mix 
them by degrees in some good cullis, till it is of the thickness 
of cream. Put them in a stewpan, boil them up ; strain the 
gravy from the herbs, pressing it from them very hard with 
the back of a spoon ; add to the gravy half a glass of wine, 
half a spoonful of salad oil, the squeeze of a lemon, and a 
pinch of sugar. This sauce is excellent for most dishes.

rots, parsley roots, onions, mushrooms, a bay-leaf, some thyme, 
a blade of mace, a few cloves, and some spices : fry the whole 
white in butter ; pour in a pint of white wine, or less, accord- 
ing to the quantity of sauce required ; put in the fish, and let 
it stew thoroughly to make the sauce. Then take a little 
browned flour and butter, and mix it with the reserved liquor ;

these stew very gently on the corner of the stove ; skim off the 
grease ; put in a little salt and cayenne pepper, and add two 
spoonfuls of the essence of anchovy and a quarter of a pound 
of butter kneaded with flour. Squeeze in the juice of a whole

gravy you may want ; put it into a stewpan, with an onion or 



SAUCES. 199

gentle fire, and pour off the gravy as it draws from it. Then 
let the meat brown ; keep turning it to prevent its burning, 
pour over some boiling water, and add a few cloves, pepper- 
corns, a bit of lemon, and a bunch of sweet-herbs. Gently 
simmer it, and strain it with the gravy that was drawn from 
the meat, some salt, and a spoonful of ketchup. 

Beef Gravy, to keep for use. 

Cover a piece of six or eight pounds with water ; boil it for 
twenty minutes or half an hour : then take out the meat, beat 
it thoroughly, and cut it in pieces, to let out the gravy. Put 
it again into the water, with a bunch of sweet-herbs, an onion 
stuck with cloves, a little salt, and some whole pepper. Let 
it stew, but not boil, till the meat is quite consumed ; pass it 
through a sieve, and let it stand in a cool place. It will keep 
for a week, if the weather is not very hot. If you want to 
use this for a hash of brown meat, put a little butter in your 
frying-pan, shake in a little flour as it boils, and add a glass of 
claret : if for a white sauce to fowls or veal, melt the butter in 
the gravy, with a glass of white wine, two spoonfuls of cream, 
and the yolks of four or six eggs, according to the quantity of 
sauce required. 

Brown Gravy.

a pint of small beer, the same quantity of water, an onion, a 
piece of lemon-peel cut small, three cloves, a blade of mace, 
some whole pepper, a spoonful of mushroom-pickle, the same 
quantity of ketchup, and an anchovy. Let the whole boil to- 
gether a quarter of an hour ; strain it off, and it will be a good 
sauce.

you have stewed any thing k la braise, provided it be not 
tainted game ; skim it, and strain it through a sieve ; then 
put in a bit of butter about the size of a walnut, mixed with 
flour ; thicken it over the fire, and add the juice of a lemon, 
and a little salt and cayenne pepper.

Ham Sauce. 

When your ham is almost done, let the meat be picked clean 
from the bone, and mash it well ; put it into a saucepan with 
three spoonfuls of gravy ; set it over a slow fire, stirring it all 
the while, otherwise it will stick to the bottom. When it has 
been on for some time, add a small bundle of sweet-herbs,

in flour, and let it stew till the ingredients are quite soft. 

Sauce for White Hashes or Chickens. 
A pint of new milk, the yolk of two eggs, well beaten, two 
ounces of butter, well mixed with flour; mix it all together in 
a saucepan, and, when it boils, add two spoonfuls of mushroom 
ketchup ; it must be stirred all the time, or it will not do. If

possible, the sauce made first to boil, and then the meat put 
into it, till it is hot enough for table. 

Horseradish Sauce.

mushrooms cut small, a bunch of parsley, scallions, and half a 
laurel-leaf, two cloves, and a clove of garlic ; turn the whole a

little for that purpose ; set it on again, and serve it ; it will be 
found to eat weU with any white meat. 

Ketchup. 
Put a pint of the best white wine vinegar into a wide- 
mouthed quart bottle ; add twelve cloves of shalots, peeled and 
bruised ; take a quarter of a pint of the strongest red wine and 
boil it a little ; wash and bone about a dozen anchovies, let 
them dissolve in the wine, and, when cold, put them into the 
vinegar bottle, stopping it close with a cork, and shaking it 
well. Into the same quantity of wine put a spoonful of pepper 
bruised, a few races of splif'ginger, half a spoonful of cloves 
bruised, and a few blades of large mace, and boil them till the 
strength of the spice is extracted. When the liquor is almost 
cold, cut in slices two large nutmegs, and when quite cold put 
into it some lemon-peel. Put that into the bottle, and scrape 
thin a large, sound horseradish root, and put that also into the 
bottle ; stop it down close ; shake it well together every day

to lighten the whole. Stir it over the fire till it thickens. This 
sauce may be served with all sorts of meat that require a sharp 
relishing sauce. 

Meat Jelly for Sauces. 

Every sort of dish requires good sauce, and for every sauce 
it is absolutely necessary to have a good meat jelly. The fol- 
lowing may be depended upon as being excellent : a shin of 
beef, about eight pounds, rather more than less ; a knuckle of 
veal, about nine pounds; a neck of mutton, about nine pounds; 
two fowls ; four calves' feet : carefully cut off all fat whatever, 
and stew over a stove as slowly as possible, till the juice is 
entirely extracted. This will produce about seven quarts of 
jelly. No pepper, salt, or herbs of any kind. These should 
be added in using the jelly, whether for soups, broths, or sauces ; 
but the pure jelly is the thing to have as the foundation for 
every species of cookery.

and bruise them with your hands. Put some of them into an 
earthen pan ; throw some salt over them ; then put in more 
mushrooms, then more salt, till you have done. Add half an 
oimce of beaten mace and cloves, and the same quantity of all- 
spice ; and let them stand five or six days, stirring them every 
day. Tie a paper over and bake for four hours in a slow oven ; 
strain out the liquor through a cloth, and let it stand to settle. 
Pour it off clear from the sediment : to every gallon of liquor 
put a quart of red wine ; if not salt enough, add a little more 
salt, with a race of ginger cut small, and half an ounce of cloves 
and mace, and boil till reduced nearly one third. Strain it 
through a sieve into a pan ; next day pour it from the settlings, 
«nd bottle it for use. 

Mushroom Ketchup, No. 2.

spice, a good deal of each, and boil them together. Bottle the 
liquor, and put five or six cloves into each bottle.

put them into an earthen pipkin with salt, cover them close 
with a coarse paste, and put them in the oven for seven hours 
or thereabout. Squeeze them a little, and pour off the liquor, 
which must be put upon fresh mushrooms, and bake these as 
long as the first. Then pour off the liquor, after pressing, and 
boil it well with salt sufficient to keep. Boil it half away till 
it appears clammy. When cold, botUe it up. 

Mushroom Ketchup, No. 4.

a pound of anchovies, some thyme, two onions sliced, parsley, 
cloves, and mace. Let them stew gently on the fire ; then

SAUCES'. 21 1 

Sauce for Turkey or Chicken, 
Boil a spoonful of the best mace veiy tender, and also the 
liier of the turkey, but not too much, which would make it 
bard ; pound the mace with a few drops of the liquor to a very 
fine pulp ; then pound the liver, and put about half of it to the 
mace, with pepper, salt, and the yolk of an e^g, boiled hard, 
and then dissolved; to this add by degrees the liquor that 
drains from the turkey, or some other good gravy. Put these 
liquors to the pulp, and boil them some time ; then take half a 
pint of oysters and boil them but a little, and lastly, put in 
white wine, and butter wrapped in a little flour. Let it boil 
but a little, lest the wine make the oysters hard ; and just at 
last scald four spoonfuls of good cream, and add, with a little 
lemon-juice, or pickled mushrooms will do better.

Walnut Ketchup, No. 1. 

Take walnuts when they are fit to pickle, beat them in a 
mortar, press out the juice through a piece of cloth, let it stand

anchovies are dissolved ; then skim, and to every pint of liquor 
add an eighth of an ounce of mace, the same of cloves and 
Jamaica pepper, half a pint of common vinegar, half a pound 
of shalots, with a few heads of garlic, and a little cayenne. 
Boil all together till the shalots are tender, and when cold bottle 
up for use. 

A spoonful of this ketchup put into good melted butter makes 
an excellent fish-sauce ; it is equally fine in gravy for ducks or 
beef-steaks.

cloves, two oimces of long pepper, half an ounce of mace, a 
little ginger, and horseradish, cut in slices. Boil all together 
till reduced to half the quantity ; pour it into a pan, when cold, 
and bottle it. Cork it tight, and it will be fit for use in three 
months. 

If you have any pickle left in the jar after the walnuts are 
used, put to every gallon two heads of garlic, a quart of red

fire; throw the syrup over the apples as they boil, to make 
them look clear. When they are done, add lemon-juice to 
your taste ; and when you can run a straw through them they 
are done enough. Put them, without the S3rrup, into a bowl ; 
cover them close, and boil the syrup till you think it sufficiently 
thick : then take it off, and throw it hot upon the pippins, 
keeping them always under it. 

Apple Cheese. 
Seven pounds of apples cored, one pound and three quarters 
of sugar, the juice and peel of two lemons ; boil these in a 
stewpan till quite a thick jelly. Bake the apple till soft ; break 
it as smooth as possible ; put it into pots, and tie down close. 

Conserve of Apples. 

Take as many golden rennets as will fill the dish that is to 
go to table ; pick them of a size ; pare them, and take out the 
cores at the bottom, that they may appear whole at the top; 
With the cores and about half a glass of water make a syrup ; 
when it is half done, put in your apples, and let them stew till 
they are done. Be careful not to break them ; place them in 
your dish ; that your S3rrup may be fine, add the white of an 
egg well beaten ; skim it, and it will be clarified. Squeeze into 
it the juice of a lemon, with the peel cut in small shreds. 
This should boil a minute ; then throw over the syrup, which 
should be quite a jelly. 

Apple Demandon. 

The whites of seven or eight very fresh eggs, put into a fiat 
dish, with a very little finely sifted sugar, and beaten to a very 
thick froth. It will require to be beaten full half an hour 
before it becomes of a sufficient substance. It is then to be 
put over the apple and custard, and piled up to some height ; 
after which place it in a very quick oven, and let it remain till 
it becomes partially of a light brown colour. 

It should be done immediately before it is sent up to table* 

Apple Fraise. 
Fare six large apples, take out the cores, cut them in slices, 
and fry them on boUi sides with butter ; put them on a sieve 
to dram ; mix half a pint of mi& and two eggs, wiUi flour, to 
batter, not too stiff; put in a little lemon-peel, shred very fine, 
and a little beaten cinnamon. Put some butter into a frying-fiaii, 
and make it hot ; put in half Uie batter, and lay the iappks on it ; 

l2 



220 CONFECTIONARY. 

let it fry a little to set it ; then put the remaining batter over 
it ; fry it on one side ; then turn it, and fty the other brown : 
put it into a dish ; strew powder-sugar over it, and squeeze on 
it the juice of a Seville orange. 

Apple Fritters. 
Pare six large apples and cut out the cores ; cut them in 
slices as thick as a half-crown piece. Mix half a pint of cream 
and two eggs with flour into a stiff batter, put in a glass of 
wine or brandy, a little lemon-peel, shred very fine, two ounces 
of powder-sugar : mix it well up, and then put in the apples. 
Have a pan of hog's lard boiling hot ; put in every slice singly 
as fast as you can, and fry them quick, of a fine gold colom* 
on both sides ; then take them out, and put them on a sieve 
to drain ; lay them on a dish, and sprinkle them with sugar. 
For fritters be careful that the fat in which you fry them is 
quite sweet and clean., 

Apple Jelly, No. 1. 
Pare and slice pippins, or sharp apples, into a stewpan, with 
just as much water as will cover lliem ; boil them as fast as 
possible till half the liquid is wasted; then strain them through 
a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice put three quarters of a 
pound of sugar. Boil it again till it becomes jelly ; put lemon- 
juice and lemon-peel to the palate. Some threads of lemon- 
peel should remain in the jelly. 

Apple Jelly. No. 2. 
Take about a half sieve of John apples, or golden pippins ; 
pare them, and put them in a clean bright copper pan; add as 
much river water as will cover them ; set them over a charcoal 
fire, turning them now and then, till they are boiled tender. 
Put a hair-sieve over a pan, and throw them on to drain ; then 
put the apples in a large pan or mortar, and beat them into 
pulp. Put them back into the copper pan, adding about half 
the water that came from them ; then set them on the fire, and 
stir them till they boil two or three minutes. Strain them into 
a flannel jelly-bag ; it should run out quite slowly, and be 
thick like syrup ; you should allow it six or eight hours to nm 
or drop. Then measure the jelly into a bright copper pan, 
and to each pint add one pound of treble-refined sugar ; put 
it on a slow fire till the sugar is melted ; then let the fire be 
made up, that it may boU ; keep skimming it constantly. 
When you hold up the skimmer near the window, or in the 
cool, and you perceive it hangs about half an inch, with a drop 



CONFECTIONARY. 221 

at the end, then add the juice of half a lemon, if a small 
quantity. Take it off the fire, and pour it into gallipots. 

The apples that are supposed to have the most jelly in them 
in this country are the John apple. The best time to make the 
jelly is the autumn ; the riper they get, the less jelly. If the 
flannel bag is quite new, it should be washed in several clean 
warm waters, without soap. The jelly, if well made, should 
appear like clear water, about the substance of currant-jelly. 

Apple Jelly, No. 3. 
Take apples, of a light green, without any spot or redness, 
and rather sour ; cut them in quarters, taking out the cores, 
and put them into a quart of water ; let them boil to a pulp, 
and strain it through a hair-sieve, or jelly-bag. To a pint of 
liquor take a pound of double-refined sugar ; wet your sugar, 
and boil it to a thick S3rrup, with the white and shell of an egg: 
then strain your syrup, and put your liquor to it. Let it boil 
again, and, as it boils, put in the juice of a lemon and the peel, 
pared extremely thin, and cut as fine as threads ; when it jellies, 
which you may know by taking up some in your spoon, put it 
in moidds ; when cold, turn it out into your dish ; it should be 
so transparent as to let you see all the flowers of your china 
dish through it, and quite white. 

Crab Jam or Jelly. 

Pare and core the crabs ; to fifteen pounds of crabs take ten 
pounds of sugar, moistened with a little water ; boil them well, 
skimming the top. When boiled tender, and broke to the con- 
sistency of jam, pour it into your pans, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. It is better the second year than the first. The 
crabs should be ripe. 

Pippin or Codling Jelly. 

Slice a pound of pippins or codlings into a pint of clear spring 
water ; let them boil till the water has extracted all the flavour 
of the fruit ; strain it out, and to a pint of this liquor take a 
pound of double-refined sugar, boiled to sugar again ; then put 
in your codling liquor ; boil it a little together as fast as you can. 
Put in your golden pippins ; boil them up fast for a little while; 
just before the last boiling, squeeze in the juice of a lemon; boil 
it up quick Clkce more, taking care the apples do not lose their 
colour ; cut Ihem, and put them in glasses with the jelly. It 
makes a vevf pretty middle or comer dish. 

' ^ Apples and Pears, to dry. 

Take £irton pippins or royal russets, golden pippins or 
nonpareOl ; finely pare and quarter the russets, and pare axid 



222 ' confectionary; 

take out the core alsa of jlie smaller apples. Take the clean tops 
of wicker baskets or hampers* and pat the apples on the wickers 
m a cool oven. Let them remain in till the oven is qnite cold : 
then they must be turned as you £nd necessary, and the cool 
oven repeated till they are properly dry. They must stand some 
time b^ore they are baked, and kept carefuUy from the damp 
air. The richer the pears the better ; but they must not be 
over-ripe. 

Apricots in Brandy. 

The apricots must be gathered before they are quite ripe, 
and, as tiie fruit is usually riper on one side than the other, 
you must prick the unripe side with the point of a penknife, or 
a very laxge needle. Put them into cold water, and give them 
a great deal of room in the preserving-pan ; and proceed in the 
same manner as directed for peaches. If they are not well 
coloured, it is owing to an improper choice of the fruit, being 
too ripe or too high coloured, provided the brandy be of the 
right sort. 

Apricot Chips, 

Cut apricots when ripe in small thin pieces ; take double-re- 
fined sugar, pounded very small and sifted through a fine sieve, 
and strew a little at the bottom of a silver basin ; then put in 
your chips, and more of your sugar. Set them over a chaffing- 
dish of coals, shaking your basin, lest the chips should stick to 
the bottom, till you put in your sugar. When your sugar is 
all candied, lay them on glass plates ; put them in a stove, and 
turn them out. 

Apricot Burnt Cream. 

Boil a pint of cream with some bitter almonds pounded, and 
strain it off. When the cream is cold, add to it the yolks of 
four eggs, with half a spoonful of flour, well mixed together; 
set it over the fire ; keep stirring it till it is thick. Add to it 
a little apricot jam ; put it in your dish ; sift powdered sugar 
over it, and brown it with your salamander. 

Apricots, to dry. 
Pare and stone a- pound of apricots, and put to them three 
quarters of a pound of double-refined sugar, strewing some of 
the sugar over the apricots as you pare them, that they may 
not lose colour. When they are all pared put the remainder of 
the sugar on them ; let them stand all night, and in the mom* 
ing boil them on a quick fire till they are clear. Then let them 
stand till next day covered with a sheet of white paper. Set 
them on a gentle fire till scalding hot ; let them stand three 
days in the syrup ; lay them out on stone plates ; put them 
into a stove, and turn them every day till they are dry. 



CONFECTIONARY. 223. 

Apricot Jam. 
Take two poundlB of apricot paste in pulp and a pint of strong 
codling liquor ; boil them very fast togetiier till the liquor is 
almost wasted ; then put to it one pound and a half of fine 
sugar pounded ; boil it very fast till it jellies ; put it into pots, 
and it will make clear cakes in the winter* 

Apricot and Plum Jam. 
Stone the fruit ; set them over the fire with half a pint of 
water ; when scalded, rub them through a sieve, and to every 
pound of pulp put a pound of sifted loaf-sugar. Set it over a 
brisk fire in a preserving-^pan ; when it boils, skim it well, 
and throw in the kernels of the apricots and half an ounce of 
bitter almonds blanched; boil it together fast for a quarter 
of an hour, stirring it all the time. 

Apricot Paste, 
Take ripe apricots, pare, stone, and quarter them, and put 
them into a skillet, setting them on embers, and stirring them 
till all the pieces are dissolved. Then take three quarters of 
their weight in fine sugar, and boil it to a candy ; put in the 
apricots, and stir it a little on the fire ; then turn it out into 
glasses. Set it in a warm stove; when it is dry on one side, 
turn the other. You may take apricots not fully ripe, and 
coddle them, and that will do also. 

Another. 
Pare and stone your apricots ; to one pound of fruit put one 
pound of fine sugar, and boil all together till they break. Then 
to five pounds of paste put three pounds of codling jelly, and 
make a candy of three pounds of fine sugar. Put it in all 
together ; just scald it, and put it in little pots to dry quickly. 
Turn it out to dry on plates or glasses. 

Apricots, to preserve. 
Stone and pare four dozen of large apricots, and cover them 
with three pounds of fine sugar finely beaten ; put in some of 
the sugar as you pare them. Let them stand at least six or 
seven hours ; then boil them on a slow fire till they are clear 
and tender. If any of them are clear before the rest, take 
them out and put them in again. When the rest are ready, let 
them stand closely covered with paper till next day. Then 
make very strong codling jelly : to two pounds of jelly add 
two pounds of sugar, which boil till they jelly ; and while boil- 
ing make your apricots scalding hot ; put the jelly to the apri- 



224 CONFECTIONARY. 

cots, and boil them, but not too fast. When the apricots rise 
in the jelly and jelly well, put them in pots or glasses, and 
cover closely with brandy paper. 

Another way. 
Cut in half, and break in pieces, ripe apricots ; put them in a 
preserving pan, simmer for a few minutes, and pass through a 
fine hair sieve : no water to be used. Add three quarters of a 
pound of white powdered sugar to a pound of fruit ; put in the 
kernels ; mix all together, and boil for twenty minutes : well 
skim when it begins to boil. Put it into pots; when cold, 
cover close with paper dipped in brandy, and tie down with an 
outer cover of paper. 

Apricots y to preserve whole. 
Gather the fruit before it is too ripe, and to one pound put 
three quarters of a pound of fine sugar. Stone and pare the 
apricots as you put them into the pan ; lay sugar under and 
over them, and let them stand till next day. Set them on a 
quick fire, and let them just boil ; skim well ; cover them till 
cold, or till the following day; give them another boil; put 
them in pots, and strew a little sugar over them while cod- 
dling, to make them keep their colour. 

Apricots, to preserve in Jelly, 

To a pound of apricots, before they are stoned and pared, 
weigh a pound and a quarter of the best pounded sugar. Stone 
and pare the fruit, and, as you pare, sprinkle some sugar under 
and over them. When the sugar is pretty well melted, set 
them on the fire and boil them. Keep out some sugar to strew 
on them in the boiling, which assists to clear them. Skim very 
clear, and turn the fruit with a ladle or a feather. When clear 
and tender, put them in glasses ; add to the S)rrup a quarter of 
a pint of strong pippin liquor, and nearly the weight of it in 
sugar ; let it boil awhile, and put it to the apricots. The fire 
should be brisk, as the sooner any sweetmeat is done the clearer 
and better it will be. Let the liquor run through a jelly -bag, 
that it may clear before you put the syrup to it, or the syrup 
of the apricots to boil. 

French Bances, 

Take half a pint of water, a bit of lemon-peel, a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, and a little orange-flower water ; 
boil them gently three or four minutes ; take out the lemon- 
peel, and add to it by degrees half a pint of flour: keep it boiling 
and stirring until it is a stiflf paste ; then take it off the fire, and. 



CONFECTIONARY. 225 

put in six ejgs, well beaten, leaving out three whites. Beat 
all very well for at least half an hour, till it is a stiff light paste; 
then take two pounds of hog's-lard ; put it in a stewpan ; give 
it a boil up, and, if the bances are of a right lightness, fry them; 
keep stirring them all Uie time till they are of a proper brown. 
A large dish will take six or seven minutes boiling. When 
done, put them in a dish to drain; keep them by the fire; 
strew sugar over them ; and, when you are going to fry them, 
drop them through the handle of a key. 

Barberries, to preserve. 
Tie up the finest maiden barberries in bunches ; to one pound 
of them put two pounds and a quarter of sugar ; boil the sugar 
to a thick syrup, and when thick enough stir it till it is almost 
cold. Put in tiie barberries ; set them on the fire, and keep 
th^m as much under the syrup as you can, shaking the pan 
frequently. Let th^n just simmer till the S3rrup is hot through, 
but not boiling, which would wrinkle them. Take them out of 
the syrup, and let them drain on a lawn sieve ; put the syrup 
again into the pot, and boil it till it is thick. When half cold 
put in the barberries, and let them stand all night in the pre- 
serving-pan. If the syrup has become too thin, take out the 
fruit and boil it again, letting it stand all night : then put it 
into pots, and cover it with brandy paper. 

Biscuits. 

Take one pound of loaf sugar, finely beaten and sifted ; then 
take eight eggs, whites and aU; beat them in a wooden bowl 
for an hour ; then take a quarter of a pound of. blanched 
almonds, beat them very small with some rose-water ; put them 
into the bowl, and beat them for an hour longer ; then shake in 
five ounces of fine flour and a spoonful of coriander seed, and 
one of caraways. Beat them ha£f an hour ; butter your plates, 
and bake them. 

Another way. 

Take one pound of flour ; mix it stiff with water ; then roll 
it very thin; cut out the biscuits with cutters, and bake them. 

Dutch Biscuits. 
Take the whites of six eggs in fine sugar, and the whites of 
four in flour ; then beat your eggs with the sugar and flour well 
with a whisk: butter your pans, and only half fill them; 
strew them over with sugar before you put them in the oven ; 
grate lemon-peel over them.

226 CONFECTIONARY. 

Ginger Biscuits. 
One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pound of 
loaf sugar, rather more than one ounce of ginger powdered, all 
well mixed together. Let it stand before the fire for half an 
hour ; roll it into thin paste, and cut out with a coffee-cup or 
wine-glass : bake it for a few minutes. 

Lemon Biscuits. 

Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds in cold water ; beat 
them with the whites of six eggs, first whipped up to a froth ; 
put in a little at a time as they rise; the almonds must be very 
fine. Then add one pound of double-refined sugar, beaten and 
sifted ; put in, by degrees, four ounces of fine flour, dried well 
and cold again ; the yoUcs of six eg^ well beaten ; the peels 
of two large lemons finely grated : beat these all together about 
half an hour ; put them in tin pans ; sift on a little sugar. 
The oven must be pretty quick, though you keep the door open 
while you bake them. 

Another way. 

Take three poimds of fine sugar, and wet it with a spoonful 
and a half of gum-dragon, and put in the juice of lemons, but 
make the mass as stiff as you can : mix it well, and beat it up 
with white of eggs. When beaten very light, put in two grains 
of musk and a great deal of grated lemon ; drop Hfie paste into 
round papers, and bake it. 

Ratafia Biscuits. 

Blanch two ounces of bitter almonds in cold water, and beat 
them extremely fine with orange-flower water and rose-water. 
Put in by degrees the whites of five eggs, first beaten to a light 
froth. Beat it extremely well ; then mix it up with fine sifted 
sugar to a light paste, and lay the biscuits on tin plates with 
wafer paper. Make the paste so light that you may take it up 
with a spoon. Lay it in cakes, and bake them in a rather bri^ 
oven. If you make them with sweet almonds only, they are 
almond pufls or cakes. 

Table Biscuits, 

Flour, milk, and sugar, well mixed together. Shape tiie 
biscuits with the top of a glass, and bake tibiem on a tin. 

Blancmange. No. 1. 
To one pint of calves' foot or hartshorn jelly add four ounces 
of almonds blanched and beaten very fine with rose and orange- 
flower water ; let half an ounce of the almonds be bitter, but 
apricot kernels are better. Put the almonds and jelly, mixed 
by degrees, into a skillet, with as much sugar as will sweeten

and strain it into a bowl ; add to it some thick cream : give it 
a boil after the cream is in» and keep it stirred while on the fire* 
When strained, put it into moulds^ 

Blancmange^ No. 2. 
Boil three ounces of isinglass in a quart of water till it is 
reduced to a pint ; strain it through a sieve, and let it stand till 
oold. Take off what has settled at the bottom : then take a 
pint of cream, two ounces of almonds, and a few bitter ones ; 
sweeten to your ta^te. Boil all together over the fire, and pour 
it into your moulds. A laurel leaf improves it greatly. 

Blancmange. No. 3. 
Take an ounce of isinglass dissolved over the fire in a quarter 
of a pint of water, strain it into a pint of new milk ; boil it, 
and strain again; sweeten to your taste. Add a spoonful of 
orange-flower water and one of mountain. Stir it till it is nearly 
cold, and put it into moulds. Beat a few bitter almonds in it. 

Blancmange, No. 4. 
Into two quarts of milk put an ounce of isinglass, an ounce 
of sugar, half the peel of a lemon, and a bit of cinnamon. 
Keep stirring till it boils. 

Dutch Blancmange, 
Steep an ounce of the best isinglass two hours in a pint of 
boiling water. Take a pint of wfite wine, the yolks of eight 
eggs well beaten, the juice of four lemons and one Seville 
orange, and the peel of one lemon ; mix them together, and 
sweeten to your taste. Set it on a clear fire ; keep it stirred till 
it boils, and then strain it off into moulds. 

Bread. 

Forty pounds of flour, a handful of salt, one quart of yest, 
three quarts of water ; stir the whole together in the kneading 
trough. Strew over it a little flour, and let it stand covered 
for one hour. Knead it and make it into loaves, and let them 
stand a quarter of an hour to rise, before you put them in the 
oven. 

Diet Bread, which keeps moist. 

Three quarters of a pound of lump sugar, dissolved in a quarter 
of a pint of water, half a pound of the best flour, seven egg^, 
taking away the whites of two ; mix the liquid sugar, when it 
has Iwiled, with the eggs : beat them up together in a basin 
with a whisk ; then add by degrees the flour, beating all toge- 



228 CONFECTIONARY. 

ther for about ten minutes ; put it into a quick oven. An 
hour bakes it. 

Tin moulds are the best : the dimensions for this quantity 
are six inches in length and four in depth. 

Potato Bread, 
Boil a quantity of potatoes ; drain them well, strew over 
them a small quantity of salt, and let them remain in the vessel 
in which they were boiled, closely covered, for an hour, which 
makes them mealy : then peel and pound them as smooth as 
flour. Add eight pounds of potatoes to twelve of wheaten flour ; 
and make it into dough with yest, in the way that bread is 
generally made. Let it stand three hours to rise. 

Rice Bread, 
Boil a quarter of a pound of rice till it is quite soft ; then 
put it on the back of a sieve to drain. When cold, mix it with 
three quarters of a pound of flour, a tea-cupful of milk, a pro- 
per quantity of yest, and salt. Let it stand for three hours ; 
then knead it very well, and roll it up in about a handful of 
flour, so as to make the outside dry enough to put into the oven. 
About an hour and a quarter will bake a loaf of this size. When 
baked, it will produce one pound fourteen ounces of very good 
bread ; it is better when the loaves are not made larger than 
the above-mentioned quantity will produce, but you may make 
any quantity by allowing the same proportion for each loaf. 
This bread should not be cut till it is two days old. 

Rye Bread, 

Take one peck of wheaten flour, six pounds of rye flour, a 
little salt, half a pint of good yest, and as much warm water 
as will make it into a stiff dough. Let it stand three hours to 
rise before you put it into the oven. A large loaf will take 
three hours to bake. 

Scotch short Bread. 

Melt a pound of butter, pour it on two pounds of flour, half 
a tea-cupful of yest, two ounces of caraway seeds, one ounce of 
Scotch caraways; sweeten to your taste with lump sugar, then 
knead it well together and roU it out, not too thin ; cut in quar- 
ters and pinch it round : prick it well with a fork. 

Buttered Loaves. 
Take three quarts of new milk ; put in as much runnet as 
will turn it; whey the curds very clean ; break them small with 
your hands; put in nine yolks of eggs and one white, a hand- 



CONFECTIONARY. 229 

ful of grated bread, half a handful of flour, and a little salt. 
Mix these well together, working it well with your hands ; roll 
it into small loaves, and bake them in a quick oven three quar- 
ters of an hour. Then take half a pound of butter, four spoon- 
fuls of clear water, half a nutmeg sliced very thin, and a little 
sugar. Set it on a quick fire, stirring it quickly, and let it boil 
till thick. When the loaves are baked, cut out the top and stir 
up the crumb with a knife ; then pour some of the butter into 
each of them, and cover them up again. Strew a little sugar 
on them : before you set them in the oven, beat the yolk of an 
^g and a little beer together, and with a feather smear them 
over with it. 

Egg Loaf, 
Soak crumb of bread in milk for three hours; strain it 
through a sieve ; then put in a little salt, some candied citron 
and lemon-peel cut small, and sugar to your taste. Put to 
your paste the yolks only of six or eight new-laid eggs, and 
beat it till the eggs are mixed. Whip the whites of the eggs till 
they are frothed ; add to the other ingredients, and mix them 
well. Butter the pan or dish in which you bake your loaf. 
When baked, turn it out into your dish, scrape some fine sugar 
upon it, and glaze with a hot shovel. 

Buns. No. 1. 
Two pounds of flour, a quarter of a pound of butter ; rub the 
butter in the flour like grated bread ; set it to the fire to dry : 
put in one pound of currants and a quarter of a pound of moist 
sugar, with a few caraway seeds, and two spoonfuls of good 
yest ; make the dough into small buns ; set them to rise half 
an hour : you may put two or three eggs in if you like. 

Buns. No. 2. 
One pound of fine flour, two pounds of currants, a few car- 
away seeds, a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, a pint of 
new milk, and two table-spoonfuls of yest ; mix all weU toge- 
ther in a stiff paste, and let it stand half an hour to rise; then 
roll them out, and put them in your tins ; let them stand 
another half hour to rise before you bake them. The above 
receipt answers equally well for a cake baked in a tin. 

Buns. No. 3. 
Take flour, butter, and sugar, of each a quarter of a pound, 
four eggs, and a few caraway seeds. This quantity will make 
two dozen. Bake them on tins. 



230 CONFECTIONARY* 

Bath Suns. 

Take a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar finely powdered, the 
same quantity of butter, and nearly double of flour dried before 
the fire, a walnut-shell full of caraway-seeds just bruised, and 
one egg. Work all these up together into a paste, the tliick<* 
ness of half-a-crown, and cut it with a tea-cup. Flour a tin ; 
lay the cakes upon it ; take the white of an egg well beat and 
frothed ; lay it on them with a feather, and ti^en grate upon 
them a little fine sugar. 

Another way. 

Take one pound of fine flour, dry it well by the fire, sift it, 
and rub into it a pound of butter, the yolks of four eggs, the 
whites of two, both beaten light, three spoonfuls of cream, 
and the like quantity of white wine and ale yest. Let this 
sponge stand by the fire to rise ; then beat it up extranely well 
and light with your hand; grate in a nutmeg ; continue beat- 
ing tiU it is ready for the oven ; then add a pound of rough 
caraway seeds, keeping a few out to strew on the top of ti^e 
cakes before they are put into the oven. 

Plain Buna. 
Take three pounds of flour, six ounces of butter, six ounces 
of sugar sifted fine, six eggs, both yolks and whites. Beat 
your eggs till they will not slip off the spoon ; melt the butter 
in a pint of new milk, with which mix hsdf a pint of good yest; 
strain it into the flour, and throw in half an ounce of cara- 
way seeds. Work the fWhole up very light ; set it before 
the fire to rise ; then make it up into buns of the size of a 
penny roll, handling them as little as possible. Twenty mi- 
nutes will bake them suffici^tly. 

Butter, to make without churning. 

Tie up cream in a fine napkin, and then in a coarse cloth, as 
you would a pudding : bury it two feet under ground ; leave it 
there for twelve hours, and when you take it up it will be con- 
verted into butter. 

Black Butter. 

To one quart oi black gooseberries put one pint of red cur- 
rants, picked into an earthen jar. Stop it very close, and set 
it in a pot of cold water over the fire to boil till the juice comes 
out. Tlien strain it, and to every pint of liquor put a pound of 
sugar ; boil and skim it till you think it done enough : put it 
in flat pots, and keep it in a dry gplace. It will either turn out 
or cut in slices.

Spanish Butter. 

Take two gallons of new milk, boil it, and, when you take it 
off the fire, put in a quart of cream, giving it a stir ; then pour 
it through a sieve into an earthen pan : lay some sticks over 
your pan, and cover it with a cloth ; if you let it stand thus 
two days, it will be the better. Skim off the cream thick, and 
sweeten it to your taste ; you may put in a little orange-flower 
water, and whip it well up. 

Cake. 

Five pounds of flour dried, six pounds of currants, a quart 
of boiled cream, a pound and a half of butter, twenty eggs, the 
whites of six only, a pint of ale yest, one ounce of cinnamon

a quarter of a pound of sugar, a little salt, half a pound of 
orange and citron. Put in the cream and butter when it is just 
warm ; mix all well together, and let it stand before the fire to 
rise. Put it into your hoop, and leave it in the oven an hour 
and a quarter. The oven should be as hot as for a manchet.

Beat half a pound of sifted sugar and the same quantity of 
fresh butter to a cream, in a basin made warm ; mixing hsdf a 
pound of flour well dried, six eggs, leaving out four whites,

232 CONFECTIONARY. 

flour, just before the oven is ready to bake it. Both the sugar 
and the flour must be sifted and dried. 

A Plain Cake. 
Take a pound of flour, well dried and sifted ; add to it one 
pound of sugar also dried and sifted ; take one pound of butter^ 
and work it in your hands till it is like cream ; beat very light 
the yolks of ten eggs and six whites. Mix all these by degrees^ 
beating it very light, and a little sack and brandy. It must

weU in; whisk the eggs half an hour ; mix them with the but- 
ter and sugar ; put in the spice and flour ; and, when the oven 
is ready, mix in the brandy, fruit, and sweetmeats. It will 
take one hour and a half beating. Let it bake three hours. 

Cake without butter. 

Beat up eight eggs for half an hour. Have ready powdered 
and sifted one pound of loaf sugar ; shake it in, and beat it 
half an hour longer. Put to it a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds beat fine with orange-flower water ; grate the rind of 
a lemon into the almonds, and squeeze in the juice. Mix all 
together. Just before you put it in the oven, add a quarter of 
a pound of dry flour ; rub the hoop or tin with butter. An 
hour and a half will bake it. 

Another,

beat in one pound of finely sifted sugar, and three quarters of 
a pound of flour : the flour to be put in just before tiiie cake is 
going to the oven. 

Almond Cake, 

Take a pound of almonds ; blanch them in jcold water, and 
beat them as small as possible in a stone mortar with a wooden 
pestle, putting in, as you beat them, some orange-flower water. 
Then take twelve eggs, leaving out half of the whites ; beat 
them well ; put them to your jJmonds, and beat them together

dered, and when the eggs are put in add the peel of two large 
lemons finely rasped. When you beat the almonds in the mor- 
tar with orange- water, put in by degrees about four spoon- 
fuls of citron water or ratafia of apricots, or, for want of these, 
brandy and sack mixed together, two spoonfuls of each. The 
cake must be baked in a tin pan ; flour the pan before you put 
the cake into it. To try if it is done enough, thrust a straw 
through it, and if the cake sticks to the straw it is not baked 
enough ; let it remain till the straw comes out clean. 

Another, 
Take twelve eggs, leaving out half the whites ; beat the 
yolks by themselves till they look white; put to them by 
degrees one pound of fine sifted sugar ; put in, by a spoonful at

sifted, with the whites of the eggs well beaten, and continue 
this till all the flour and the whites are in; Then beat very fine 
half a pound of fine almonds, with sack and brandy, to prevent 
their oiling ; stir them into the cake. Bake it three quarters of 
an hour. Ratafia cake is made in the same manner, only keep 
out two oxmces of the almonds, and put in their stead two of 
apricot kernels ; if you have none, use bitter almonds. 

Almond Cakes, 
Take one pound of almonds, blanch them ; then take one 
pound of double-refined sugar, beaten very small; crack the 
almonds, one by^ne, upon the tops; put them into the sugar ; 
mix them, and tKen beat them well together till they will work 
like paste. Make them into round cakes ; take double -refined 
sugar, pounded and sifted, beat together with the white of an 
egg, and, when the cakes are hardened in the oven, take them 
out, and cover one side with sugar with a feather ; then put 
them into the oven again, and, when one side is hardened, take 
them out and do the same on the other side. Set them in again 
to harden, and afterwards lay them up for use. 

Clear Almond Cakes, 
Take the small sort of almonds ; steep them in cold water 
till they will blanch, and as you blanch liiem throw them into 
water. Wipe them dry, and beat them in a stone mortar, with 
a little rose-water, and as much double-refined sugar, sifted, 
as will make them into clear paste. Roll them into any size 
you please ; then dry them in an oven after bread has been 
drawn, so that they may be dry on both sides ; when they are 



234 CONFECTIONARY. 

ccMl, make a candy of sugar ; wet it a little with rose-water ; 
set it on the fire ; stir it tiU it boils, then take it off, and let it 
cool a little. With a feather spread it over the cakes on one 
side ; lay them upon papers on a table ; take the lid of a bak- 
ing-pan, put some coak on it, and set it over the cakes to 
raise the candy quickly. When they are cold, turn the other 
side, and serve it in the same manner. 

Ajpple Cake, 

Take one pound and a half of white sugar, two pounds of 
apples, pared and cut thin, and the rind of a large lemon ; put 
a pint of water to the sugar, and boil it to a S3nrup ; put the 
apples to it, and boil it quite thick. Put it into a mould to 
cool, and send it cold to table, with a custard, or cream poured 
round it. 

Another, 

One pound of apples cut and cored, one pound of sugar put 
to a quarter of a pint of water, so as to clarify the sugar, with 
the juice and peel of a lemon, and a little SevUle orange. Boil 
it tiU it is quite stiff; put it in ajnould ; when cold it will turn 
out. You may put it into a little warm water to keep it from 
breaking when taken out. 

Apricot Clear Cakes. 

Make a strong apple jelly, strain it, and put apricots into it 

to boil. Slit the apricots well, cover them with sugar, and 

boil them clear. Strain them, and put them in the candy when 

it is almost boiled up; and then put in your jelly, and scald it.

shells and all ; then take an equal weight of sugar, sifted very 
fine, and half the weight of filne flour, well dried and sifted.

another pan ; beat them light, and add the sugar to them by 
degrees. Beat them until very light ; then put the snow, con- 
tinuing to beat ; and at last add by degrees the flour. Season 
with lemon-peel grated, or any peel you like ; bake it in a slow 
oven, but hot enough to make it rise. 

Bread Cake. 

Take two pounds of flour, a quarter of a pound of butter, 

four eggs, one spoonful of good yest, half a pound of currants, 

half a pound of Lisbon sugar, some grated lemon-peel, and

CONFECTIONARY. 235 

new milk to make it of a proper stiffness. Set it to rise for 
two hours and a half before the fire, and bake it in an earthen 
pui or tin in a quick oven, of a light brown. 

Caraway seeds may be added — ^two ounces to the above 
quantity. 

Breakfast Cakes. 

To a pound of fine flour take two ounces of fresh butter, 
which rub very well in with a little salt. Beat an egg smooth, 
and mix a spoonful of light yest with a little warm milk. Mix 
as much in the flour as will make a batter proper for fritters ; 
then beat it with your hand till it leaves the bottom of the 
bowl in which it is made. Cover it up for three or four hours ; 
then add as much flour as will form a paste proper for rolling 
up ; make your cakes half an hour before you put them into 
the oven ; prick them in the middle with a skewer, and bake 
them in a quick oven a quarter of an hour. 

Excellent Breakfast Cakes, 
Water the yest well that it may jiot be bitter ; change the 
water very often ; put a very little sugar and water to it just as 
you are going to use it ; this is done to lighten and set it fer- 
menting. As soon as you perceive it to be light, mix up with 
it new milk warmed, as if for other bread ; put no water to it; 
about one pound or more of butter to about sixteen or eighteen 
cakes, and a white ot two of ^^^, beat very light ; mix all these 
together as light as you can ; then add flour to it, and beat it 
at least a quarter of an hour, until it is a tough light dough. 
Pat it to the fire and keep it warm, and warm the tins on 
which the cakes are to be baked. When the dough has risen, and 
is light, beat it down, and put it to the fire again to rise, and 
repeat this a second time ; it will add much to the lightness of 
the cakes. Make them of the size of a saucer, or thereabouts, 
and not too thick, and bake them in a slow oven. The dough, 
if made a Httle stiffer, will be very good for rolls ; but they 
must be baked in a quicker oven. 

Bath Breakfast Cakes, 
A pint of thin cream, two eggs, three spoonfuls of yest, and 
a little salt. Mix all well together with half a pound of flour.

spice, with the rest of the ingredients ; wet it with a ladle, and 
beat it well together. Do not put the currants till the cake

oven as hot as for wheaten bread. You must not wet it till the 
oven is ready.

into a stiff batter with the milk, eggs, and sack ; and, when 
you are ready to put it into the oven, add the other ingredients*

the rice-flour ; beat them all together for an hour as light as 
you can. Put in a little orange-flower water, or brandy, and 
candied peel, if you like ; the oven must not be too hot. 

Rock Cakes.

pound of currants, half a pound of sugar ; mix and pinch into 
small cakes. 

Royal Cakes, 

Take three pounds of very fine flour, one pound and a half 
of butter, and as much currants, seven yolks and three whites 
of eggs, a nutmeg grated, a little rose-water, one pound and 
a hsdf of sugar finely beaten ; knead it well and light, and bake 
on tins. 

Savoy or Sponge Cake. 

Take twelve new-] aid eggs, and their weight in double re- 
fined sugar ; pound it fine, and sift it through a lawn sieve ; 
beat the yolks very light, and add the sugar to them by degrees; 
beat the whole well together till it is extremely light. Whisk 
the whites of the eggs to a strong froth ; then mix all together 
by adding the yolks and the sugar to the whites. Have ready 
the weight of seven eggs in fine flour very well dried and sifted ; 
stir it in by degrees, and grate in the rind of a lemon. Butter 
a mould well, and bake in a quick oven. About half an hour 
or forty minutes will do it. 

Another. 
Take one pound of Jordan and two ounces of bitter almonds; 
blanch them in cold water, and beat them very fine in a mortar, 
adding orange-flower and rose-water as you beat them to prevent 
their oiling. Then beat eighteen eggs, the whites separately 
to a froth, and the yolks extremely well, with a little brandy 
and sack. Put the almonds when pounded into a dry, clean, 
wooden bowl, and beat them with your hand extremely light, 
with one pound of fine dried and sifted sugar ; put the sugar in 
by degrees, and beat it very light, also the peels of two large 
lemons finely grated. Put in by degrees the whites of the eggs 
as they rise to a froth, and in the same manner the yolks, con- 
tinuing to beat it for an hour, or until it is as light as po8s3)le. 
An hour will bake it; it must be a quick oven; you must con- 
tinue to beat the cake until the oven is ready for it. 

Seed Cake. No. 1. 
Heat a wooden bowl, and work in three pounds of butter 
with your hands, till it is as thin as cream ; then work in by

beaten, leaving out four of the whites ; put the eggs in by 
degrees. Take three pounds of the finest flour, well dried and 
sifted, mixed with one ounce and a half of caraway seeds, one 
nutmeg, and a little mace; put them in the flour as you did the 
sugar, and beat it well up with your hands ; put it in your 
hoop ; and it will take two hours* baking. You may add sweet- 
meats if you like. The dough must be made by the fire, 
and kept constantly worked with the hands to mix it well to- 
gether. If you have sweetmeats, put half a pound of citron, a 
quarter of a pound of lemon-peel, and put the dough lightly 
into the hoop, just before you send it to the oven, without 
smoothing it at top, for that makes it heavy. 

Seed Cake. No. 2. 
Take a pound and a half of butter ; beat it to a cream with 
your hand or a flat stick ; beat twelve eggs, the yolks in one 
pan and the whites in another, as light as possible, and then 
beat them together, adding by degrees one pound and a half 
of well dried and sifted loaf-sugar, and a little sack and brandy. 
When the oven is nearly ready, mix all together, with one

warm. Mix fourteen eggs in half a pint of yest. Take half a 
peck of flour, and one pound of sugar, both dried and sifted, 
four ounces of caraway seeds, and two ounces of beaten ginger. 
Mix all well together. First put the eggs and the yest to the 
flour, then add the butter and the milk. Make it into a paste 
of the substance of that for French bread ; if not flour enough 
add what is suflicient ; and if too much, put some warm new 
milk. Let it stand for above half an hour at the fire, before 
you make it up into what form you please. 

Shrewsbury Cakes.

when you are just going to put it in the oven, add half a pint of 
flour well dried. You must not beat it after the flour is in. 
Put a paper in the tin. A quick oven will bake this quantity 
in an hour. It must not be beaten with a spoon, as it will make 
it heavy. 

Another.

ounces of flour, two eggs, but the white of one only, a little 
beaten mace, and a little brandy. Mix all together into a paste 
with your hands ; make it into little cakes, and bake them on 
tins. You may put in six ounces of currants, if you like. 

Little Sugar Cakes, 
Take double- refined sugar and sift it very fine; beat the 
white of an ^g^ to a froth ; take gum-dragon that has been 
steeped in juice of lemon or orange-flower water, and some 
ambergris finely beaten with the sugar. Mix all these toge- 
ther in a mortar, and beat it till it is very white ; then roll it 
into small knobs, or make it into small loaves. Lay them on 
paper well sugared, and set them into a very gentle oven.

01^6 egg* Work all together into a paste, adding a spoonful 
of brandy. Roll the paste out to the thickness of a half-crown, 
and cut it with a tea-cup. Flour a tin, and lay the cakes upon 
it. Take the white of an egg, well beaten and frothed, dip a 
feather in this, and wash them over, and then grate upon them 
a little fine.^ugar. Put them into a slackish oven, till they 
are of a very pale brown. 

Dry Tea Cakes, 
Boil two ounces of butter in a pint of skimmed milk ; let it 
stand till it is as cold as new milk ; then put to it a spoonful 
of light yest, a little salt, and as much flour as will make it a 
stiff paste. "Work it as much, or more, than you would do 
brown bread ; let it lie half an hour to rise ; then roll it into 
thin cakes ; prick them very well quite through, to prevent 
their blistering, and bake them on tin plates in a quick oven. 
To keep crisp, they must be hung up in the kitchen, or where 
there is a constant fire. 

Thousand Cake. 

One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, six ounces of 
sugar, five eggs, leaving out three whites ; rub the flour, but- 
ter, and sugar, well together; pour the eggs into it ; work it

Tunhridge Cakes. 

One pound and a half of flour, one pound of butter ; rub the 
butter into the flour ; strew in a few caraways, and add the 
yolks of two eggs, first beaten, and as much water as will 
make it into a paste : roll it out thin, and prick it with a jag- 
ging iron ; run the cakes into what shape you please, or cut 
them with a glass. Just as you put them into the oven, sift 
sugar on them, and a very little when they come out. The 
oven must be as hot as for manchets. Bake them on paper. 

Veal Cake, 
Take thin slices of veal, and fat and lean sHces of ham, and 
lay the bottom of a basin or mould with one slice of each in 
rows. Chop some sweet-herbs very small, and fill the basin

Calves* Foot Jelly. No. 1. 

To two calves* feet put a gallon of water, and boil it to two 
quarts ; nm it through a sieve, and let it stand till it is cold ; 
then take off all the fat, and put the jelly in a pan, with a pint 
of white wine, the juice of two lemons, sugar to your taste, 
and the whites of six eggs. Stir these together near half an 
hour, then strain it through a jelly-bag ; put a piece of lemon- 
peel in the bag ; let it pass through the bag till it is clear. If 
you wish this jelly to be very clear and strong, add an ounce 
of isinglass. 

Calves* Foot Jelly. No. 2. 

Boil four calves' feet in three quarts of water for three or 
four hours, or till they will not hold together, now and then 
skimming oflf the fat. The liquor must be reduced to a quart. 
When you have quite cleared it from the fat, which must be 
done by papering it over, add to it nearly a bottle of white 
wine, sherry is the best, the juice of four or five lemons, the 
peel also pared very thin, so that no white is Teft on it, and 
sugar to ybur taste. Then beat up six whites of eggs^ to a stiff 
froth, and with a whisk keep stirring it over the fire till it 
boils. Then pour it into the jelly-bag, and keep changing it 
till* it comes clear. This quantity will produce about a quart of 
jelly strong enough to turn out of moulds. 

Calves* Foot Jelly. No. 3. 

Take two feet to two quarts of water ; reduce it to three pints 

of jelly. Then add the juice and peel of four lemons, one 

ounce of isinglass, the shells and whites of four eggs, a little 

cinnamon, mace, and allspice, and a good half pint of Madeira. 

Calves* Foot Jelly. No. 4. 
Stew a calf s foot slowly to a jelly. Melt it with a little 
wine, sugar, and lemon-peel. 

Cheese, to make. 
Strain some milk" into a cheese tub, as warm as you can 
from the cow ; put into it a large quantity of strong runnet> 



248 CONFECTIONARY. 

about a spoonful to sixty quarts ; stir it well with a fleeting 
dish; and cover it close with a wooden cover, made to fit 
your tub. About the middle of June, let it stand thus three 
quarters of an hour, in hotter weather less, in cold weather 
somewhat longer. When it is come, break it pretty small with 
a dish, and stir it gently till it is all come to a curd; then press 
it down gently with your dish and hand, so that the whey do 
not rise over it white ; after the whey is pretty well drained 
and the curd become tolerably hard, break it into a vat very 
small, heaped up as high as possible, and press it down, at first 
gently and then harder, with your hands, till as much whey as 
possible can be got out that way, and yet the curd continues at 
least two inches above the vat ; otherwise the cheese will not 
take press, that is, will be sour, and full of eyes and holes. 

Then put the curd into one end of a good flaxen cloth, and 
cover it with the other end, tucking it in with a wooden cheese 
knife, so as to make it lie smooth and keep the curd quite in ; 
then press it with a heavy weight or in a press, for five or six 
hours, when it will be fit to turn into a dry cloth, in which 
press it again for four hours. Then take it out, salt it well 
over, or it will become magotty, and put it into the vat again 
for twelve hours. Take it out; salt it a second time; and 
leave it in a tub or on a dresser four days, turning it every 
day. This done, wash it with cold water, wipe it with a dry 
cloth, and store it up in your cheese-loft, turning and wiping 
it every day till it is quite dry. The reason of mouldiness, 
cracks, and rottenness within, is the not well pressing, turning, 
or curing, the curd and cheese. 

The best Cheese in the world. 
To make a cheese in the style of Stilton cheese, only much 
better, take the new milk of seven cows, with the cream from 
the milk of seven cows. Heat a gallon of water scalding hot, 
and put into it three or four handfuls of marigolds bruised a 
little ; strain it into the tub containing the milk and cream, and 
put to it some runnet, but not so much as to make it come very 
hard. Put the curd into a sieve to dmin ; do not break it all, 
but, as the whey runs out, tie up the cloth, and let it stand half 
an hour or more. Then cut the curd in pieces ; pour upon it 
as much cold water as will cover it, and let it stand half an 
hour. Put part of it into a vat or a hoop nearly six inches 
deep ; break the top of it a little, just to make it join with the 
other, and strew on it a very little salt ; then put in the other 
part, lay a fifty-pound weight upon it, and let it stand half an 
hour. Turn it, and put it into the press. Turn it into wet 



CONFECTIONARY. 249 

clean cloths every hour of the day. Next morning salt it; and 
let it lie in the salt a night and a day. Keep it swathed tight, 
till it begins to dry and coat, and keep it covered with a clean 
cloth for a long time. 

The month of August is the best time for making this cheese, 
which should be kept a year before it is cut. 

Cheese, to stew. 

Scrape some rich old cheese into a saucepan, with a small 

piece of butter and a spoonful of cream. Let it stew till it is 

smooth ; add the yolk of one egg ; give it a boil all together. 

Serve it up on a buttered toast, and brown it with a salamander. 

Cream Cheese, 
Take a basin of thick cream, let it stand some time ; then 
salt it, put a thin cloth over a hair-sieve, and pour the cream 
on it. Shift the cloth every day, till it is proper; then wrap the 
cheese up to ripen in nettle or vine leaves. 

Another. 
Take a quart of new milk and a quart of cream; warm them 
together, and put to it a spoonful of runnet ; let it stand three 
hours; then take it out with a skimming-dish; break the curd 
as little as possible ; put it into a straw vat, which is just big 
enough to hold this quantity ; let it stand in the vat two days; 
take it out, and sprinkle a little salt over it; turn it every day, 
and it will be ready in ten days. 

Princess Amelia* s Cream Cheese, 
Wash the soap out of a napkin ; double it to the required 
size, and put it wet into a pewter soup-plate. Put into it a 
pint of cream ; cover it, and let it stand twenty-four hours 
unless the weather is very hot, in which case not so long. Tom 
the cheese in the napkin : sprinkle a little salt over it, and let 
it stand twelve hours. Then turn it into a very dry napkin 
out of which all soap has been washed, and salt the other side. 
It will be fit to eat in a day or two according to the weather. 
Some keep it in nut leaves to ripen it. 

Irish Cream Cheese. 
Take a quart of very thick cream, and stir well into it two 
spoonfuls of salt. Double a napkin in two, and lay it in a punch- 
bowl. Pour the cream into it ; turn the four comers over the 
cream, and let it stand for two days. Put it into a dry clotl^ 
within a little wooden cheese- vat ; turn it into dry cloths twice

a day till it is quite dry, and it will be fit to eat in a few days. 
Keep it in clean cloths in a cool place. 

Rush Cheese, 
Take a quart of cream, put to it a gill of new milk ; boil one 
half of it and put it to the other ; then let it stand till it is of 
the warmth of new milk, after which put in a little earning, 
and, when sufficiently come, break it as little as you can ; put it 
into a vat that has a rush bottom, lay it on a smooth board, 
and turn it every day till ripe. 

Winter Cream Cheese. 

Take twenty quarts of new milk warm from the cow ; strain 
it into a tub ; have ready four quarts of good cream boiled to 
put to it, and about a quart of spring water, boiling hot, and 
stir all well together ; put in your earning, and stir it well in ; 
keep it by the fire till it is well come. Then take it gently into 
a sieve to whey it, and after that put it into a vat, eiSier square 
or round, with a cheese-board upon it, of two pounds weight at 
first, which is to be increased by degrees to six pounds ; turn it 
into dry cloths two or three times a day for a week or ten days, 
and salt it with dry salt, the third day. When you take it out 
of the vat, lay it upon a board, and turn and wipe it every other 
day till it is dry. It is best to be made as soon as the cows 
go into fog. 

The cheeses are fit to eat in Lent, sometimes at Christmas, 
according to the state of the ground. 

To make Cream Cheese without Cream. 
Take a quart of milk warm from the cow and two quarts of 
boiling water. When the curd is ready for the cheese- vat, put 
it in, without breaking it, by a dishful at a time, an^ fill it up 
as it drains off. It must not be ptessed. The cheese-vat should 
have holes in it all over like a colander. Take out the cheese 
when it will bear it, and ripen it upon rushes : it must be 
more than nine inches deep. 

Damson Cheese, 
Take the damsons full ripe, and squeeze out the stones, which 
put into the preserving-pan, with as much water as will cover 
them : let them simmer tiU the stones are quite clear, and put 
your fruit into the liquor. Take three pounds of good powder 
sugar to six pounds of fruit ; boil it very fast till quite thick ; 
then break the stones, and put the whole kernels into it, before 
you put it into moulds for use. 



CONFECTIONARY- '251 

Another. 

Boil up one pound of damsons with three quarters of a pound 
of sugar ; when the fruit begins to break, take out the stones 
and tbe skins ; or, what is a better way, pulp them through a 
colander. Then peel and put in som^ of the kernels; boil it 
very high ; it will turn out to the shape of any pots or moulds, 
and is very good. 

French Cheese. 

Boil two pints of milk and one of cream, with a blade of mace 
and a little cinnamon : put the yolks of three eggs and the 
whites of two, well beaten, into your milk, and set on the fire 
again, stirring it all the while till it boils. Take it off, and stir 
it till it is a little cooled ; then put in the juice of two lemons,- 
and let it stand awhile with the lemons in it. Put it in a linen 
strainer, and hang it up to drain out the whey. When it is 
drained dry, take it down, and put to it a spoonful or two of 
rose-water, and sweeten it to your taste : put it into your pan; 
which must be full of holes ; let it stand a little ; put it into your 
dish with cream, and stick some blanched almonds about it. 

Italian Cheese. 

One quart of cream, a pint of white wine, the juice of three 
lemons, a little lemon-peel, and sugar to your taste ; beat it 
with a whisk a quarter of an hour ; then pour it on a buttered 
cloth, over a sieve, to drain all night, and turn it out just before 
it is sent to table. Strew comfits on the top, and garnish as 
you like. 

Lemon Cheese — very good. 

Into a quart of thick sweet cream put the juice of three 
lemons, with the rind finely grated ; sweeten it to your taste ; 
beat it very well ; then put it into a sieve, with some fine muslin 
underneath it, and let it stand all night. Next day turn it out, 
and garnish with preserved orange or marmalade. 

Half the above quantity makes a large cheese. Do not beat 
it till it comes to butter, but only till it is near coming. It is 
a very pretty dish. 

Cheesecake. No. 1. 

Take four quarts of new milk and a pint of cream ; put in 
a blade or two of mace, with a bag of ambergris; set it with 
as much runnet as will bring it to a tender curd. When it has 
come, break it as you would a cheese, and, when you have got 
what whey you can from it, put it in a cloth and lay it in a pan 
or cheese-hoop, placing on it a weight of five or six pounds, 
and, when you find it well pressed out, put it into an earthen 
dish, bruising it very small with a spoon. Then take two ounces

of fresh butter, with the yolks of six eggs mixed together. 
When you are ready to put it into crust, strew in half a pound 
of currants ; let the butter boil that you make your crust with ; 
roll out the cakes very thin. The oven must not be too hot, 
and great care must be taken in the baking. When they rise 
up to the top they are sufficiently done. 

Cheesecake, No. 2. 
Blanch half a pouiid of the best sweet almonds, and beat them 
very fine. Add two spoonfuls of orange-flower or rose-water,

pans with puff paste, fill them with the mixture, and bake it 
half an hour in a brisk oven. 

Cocoa-nut Cheesecakes. 
Take a cocoa-nut, which by many is thought far superior to 
almonds ; grate it the long way ; put to it some thick syrup, 
mixing it by degrees. Boil it till it comes to the consistence 
of cheese ; when half cold add to it two eggs ; beat it up with 
rose-water till it is light : if too thick, add a little more rose- 
water. When beaten up as light as possible, pour it upon a fine 
crust in cheesecake pans, and, just before they are going into 
the oven, sift over some fine sugar, which will raise a nice 
crust and much improve their appearance. The addition of 
half a pound of butter just melted, and eight more eggs, leav- 
ing out half of the whites, makes an excellent pudding. 

Cream Cheesecake, 
Two quarts of cream set on a slow fire, put into it twelve 
eggs very well beat and strained, stir it softly till it boils gently

ounces of sifted sugar, half a gill of cream, and three eggs well 
beaten. Work them well, and fill the pan, which must be lined 
with puff-paste ; lay on the top some candied lemon-peel cut 
thin. 

Another. 

Boil the peel of two lemons till tender; pound it in a 
mortar very fine ; blanch and pound a few almond kernels with 
the peel. Mix a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, a quarter 
of a pound of butter, the yolks of six eggs, all together in the 
mortar, and put it in the puff-paste for baking. This quantity 
will make twelve or fourteen cakes. 

Orange Cheesecake. 
Take the peel of one orange and a half and one lemon grated ; 
squeeze out the juice ; add a quarter of a pound of sugar, and 
a quarter of a pound of melted butter, four eggs, leaving out 
the whites, a little Naples biscuit grated, to ti^cken it, and a 
little white wine. Put almonds in it if you like. 

Scotch Cheesecake. 
Put one ounce of butter into a saucepan to clarify ; add one 
ounce of powder sugar and two eggs ; stir it over a slow fire 
until it sJmost boils, but not quite. Line your pattypans 
with paste ; bake the cakes of a nice brown, and serve them 
up between hot and cold.

Cherries, to preserve. No. 1 . 
Take either morella or carnation ; stone the fruit ; to mo- 
rella cherries take the jelly of white currants, drawn with a 
little water, and run through a jelly-hag ; to a pint and a'half 
of jelly, add three pounds of fine sugar. Set it on a quick fire ; 
when it hoils, skim it, and put in a pound of stoned cherries. 
Let them not boil too fast at first; take them off at times ; but 
when they are tender boil them very fast till they are very clear 
and jelly ; then put them into pots or glasses. The camatioii 
cherries must have red currant jelly; if you have not white cur- 
rant jelly for the morella, codling jelly will do. 

Cherries, to preserve. No. 2. 
To three quarters of a pound of cherries stoned take one 
pound and a quarter of sugar ; leave out a quarter of a pound 
to strew on them as they boil. Put in the preserving-pan a 
layer of cherries and a layer of sugar, till they are all in; boil 
them quick, keeping them closely covered with white paper, 
which take off frequently, and skim them ; strew the sugar 
kept out over them ; it will clear them very much. When they 
look clear they are done enough. Take them out of the 8)rrup 
quite clear from the skim; strain the S3rrup through a fine 
sieve ; then put to it a quarter of a pint of the juice of white 
currants, put them into the pan again, and boil it till it is a 
hanging jelly. Just before it is quite done put in the cherries ; 
give them a boil, and put them into pots. There must be 
fourteen spoonfuls of water put in at first with the cherries. 

Cherries, to preserve. No. 3. 
Stone the cherries, and to twelve pounds of fruit put nine 
pounds of sugar; boil the sugar-candy high; stir it well; 
throw in the cherries ; let them not boil too fast at first, stir- 
ring them often in the pan ; afterwards boil them fast till they 
become tender. 

Morella Cherries, to preserve. 
When you have stalked and stoned your cherries, put to them 
an equal weight of sugar : make your syrup, skim it, and take 
it off the fire. Skim it again well, and put in your cherries, 
shaking them with care in the pan. Boil them, not on a quick 
fire, lest the fruit should crack ; and take them off the fire 
several times. Let them boil till done ; put your cherries into 
pots ; strain the syrup through muslin, and boil it again till 
thoroughly done. 



256 CONFECTIONARY. 

Morella Cherries, to preserve in Brandy. 

Take two pounds of morella cherries, when not too ripe, bat 
finely coloured, weighed with their stalks and stones. Put a 
quart of water and twelve ounces of double-refined sugar into 
a preserving- pan, and set it over a clear charcoal fire. Let it 
boil a quarter of an hour ; skim it clean, and set it by till cold. 
Then take away the stalks and stones, and, when the syrup is 
quite cold, put the stoned cherries into the syrup, set them 
over a gentle fire, and let them barely simmer till their skins 
begin to rise. Take them from the fire ; pour them into a 
basin ; cut a piece of paper round of the size of the basin ; lay 
it close upon the cherries while hot, and let them stand so tiU 
next day. Set a hair sieve in a pan, and pour the cherries into 
it ; let them drain till the syrup is all drained out : boil the 
syrup till reduced to two-thirds, and set it aside till cold. Put 
your cherries into a glass jar ; put to them a spoonful of their 
own syrup and one of brandy, and continue to do so till the 
jar is filled within two inches of the top : then put over it a wet 
bladder, and a piece of leather over that ; tie it down close, and 
keep it in a warm place. 

If you do not mind the stones, merely cut off the stalks of 
the cherries. 

Brandy Cherries, 

To each bottle of brandy add half a pound of white sugar- 
candy : let this dissolve ; cut the large ripe morella cherries 
from the tree into a glass or earthen jar, leaving the stalks 
about half the original length. When the jar is fuU, pour upon 
the cherries the brandy as above. Let the fruit be completely 
covered, and fill it up as the liquor settles. Cork the jar, and 
tie a leather over the top. Apricot kernels blanched and put 
in are an agreeable addition. 

Cherries, to dry. 

Stone the cherries, and to ten poimds when stoned put three 
pounds of sugar finely beaten. Shake the cherries and sugar 
well together ; when the sugar is quite dissolved, give them a 
boil or two over a slow fire, and put them in an earthen pot. 
Next day scald them, lay them on a sieve, and dry them in the 
sun, or in a oven, not too hot. Turn them till they are dry 
enough, then put them up ; but put no paper. 

Liquor for dried Cherries. 
Take some red currants, and boil them in water till it is very 
red; then put it to your cherries and sugar it ; this makes them 
of a good colour. 



CONFECTIONARY. 257 

Cherry Jam, 
Take twelve pounds of stoned cherries ; boil and break them 
as they boil, and, when you have boiled all the juice away, and 
can see the bottom of the pan, put in three pounds of sugar 
finely beaten : stir it well in ; give the fruit two or three boils, 
and put it in pots or glasses, and cover with brandy paper. 

Cocoa, 

Take three table-spoonfuls of cocoa and one dessert spoon- 
ful of flour ; beat them well together, and boil in a pint and a 
half of spring water, upon a slow fire, for two or three hours, 
and then strain it for use. 

Cocoa-Nut Candy, 

Grate a cocoa-nut on a fine bread grater ; weigh it, and add 
the same quantity of loaf-sugar: melt the sugar with rose- 
water, of which, for a small cocoa-nut, put six table-spoonfuls. 
When the syrup is clarified and boiling, throw in the cocoa- 
nut by degrees ; keep stirring it all tibe time, whilst boiling, 
with a wooden slice, to prevent it burning to the bottom of the 
pan, which it is very apt to do, unless great care is taken. When 
the candy is sufficiently boiled, spread it on a pasteboard pre- 
viously rubbed with a wet cloth, and cut it in whatever shape 
you please. 

To know when the candy is sufficiently boiled, drop a small 
quantity on the pasteboard, and if the syrup does not run from 
die cocoa-nut, it is done enough ; when the candy is cold, put 
it on a dish, and keep it in a dry place. 

Coffee, to roast. 
For this purpose you must have a roaster with a spit. Put 
in no more coffee than will have room enough to work about 
well. Set it down to a good fire; put in every now and then a 
little fresh butter, and mix it well with a spoon. It will take 
five or six hours to roast. When done, turn it out into a 
large dish or a dripping-pan, till it is quite dry. 

Another way. 
Take two pounds of coffee, and put it into a roaster. Roast 
it one hour before a brisk fire ; add two ounces of butter, and 
let it roast till it becomes of a fine brown. Watch, that it does 
not bum. Two hours and a half will do it. Take half a pound 
for eight cups. 

Coffee to make the foreign way. 
Take Demarara — Bean Dutch coffee — in preference to 
Mocha coffee ; wash it well. When it is very clean, put it in 



258 CONFECTIONARY. 

an earthen vessel, and cover it close, taking great care that no 
air gets to it ; then grind it very thoroughly. Put a good half 
pint of coffee into a large coffee-pot, that holds three quarts, 
with a large table-spoonful of mustard ;• then pour upon it 
boiling water. It is of great consequence that the water should 
boil; but do not fill the coffee-pot too fuU, for fear of its boiling 
over, and losing the aromatic oil. Then pour the whole con- 
tents backwards and forwards several times into a clean cup or 
basin, wiping the basin or cup each time — this will clear it 
sufficiently. Let it then stand ten minutes, after which, when 
cool, pour it clear off the grounds steadily, into clean bottles, 
and lay them down on their sides, well corked. Do not throw 
away your coffee grounds, but add another table-spoonful of 
mustard to them, and fill up the vessel with boiling water, 
doing as before directed. Be sure to cork the bottles well ; 
lay them down on one side, and before you want to use them 
set them up for a couple of hours, in case any sediment should 
remain. Let it come to the boil, always taking care that it is 
neither smoked nor boils over. All coffee should be kept on a 
lamp while you are using it. 

By following this receipt as much coffee will be obtained for 
threepence as you would otherwise get for a shilling ; and it is 
the best possible coffee. 

To make Cream rise in cold weather. 

Dip each pan or bowl into a pail of boiling water before you 
strain the milk into it. Put a close cover over each for about 
ten minutes : the hot steam causes the cream to rise thick and 
rich. 

Cream, to fry. 

Take two spoonfuls of fine flour and the yolks of four eggs; 
grate in the rind of one lemon ; beat them well with the flour, 
and add a pint of cream. Mix these very well together ; 
sweeten to your taste, and add a bit of cinnamon. Put the 
whole in a stewpan over a slow fire ; continue to stir it until it 
is quite hot ; but it must not boil. Take out the cinnamon ; 
beat two eggs very well, and put them into the cream ; butter 
a pewter dish ; pour the cream in it ; put it into a warm oven 
to set, but not to colour it. When cold, cut it into pieces, 
and have ready a stewpan or frying-pan, with a good deal of 
lard ; dredge the cream with flour ; fry the pieces of a light 
brown, grate sugar over them, glaze with a salamander, and 
serve them very hot. 

Artificial Cream and Curd, 

A pint of good new milk, nine whites of eggs beat up, and 
well stirred and mixed with the milk ; put it on a slow fire to 



CONFECTIONARY. 259 

turn ; then take it off, and drain it through a fine sieve, and 
set it into a basin or mould. To make the cream for it, take 
a pint of milk and the yolks of four eggs well beat, boil it with 
a bit of cinnamon over a slow fire ; keep it constantly stirring ; 
when it is as thick as rich cream, take it off, and stir it a little 
while afterwards. 

Cream of Rice, 
Wash and well clean some very good rice ; put it into a 
stewpan, with water, and boil it gently till quite soft, with a 
little cinnamon, if agreeable to the taste. When the rice is 
boiled quite soft, take out the cinnamon. Then take a large 
dish, and set it on a table : have a clean tamis — a new one 
would be better — a tarais is only the piece of flannel com- 
monly used in kitchens for passing sauces through — and give 
one end of the tamis to a person on the opposite side of the 
table to hold, while you hold the other end with your left 
hand. Having a large wooden spoon in your right, you put 
two or three spoonfuls of boiled rice into this tamis, which is 
held over the large dish, and rub the rice upon it with the 
spoon till it passes through into the dish. Whatever sticks to 
the tamis take off with a silver spoon and put into the dish. 
When you have passed the quantity you want, put it in a 
basin. It should be made fresh every day. Warm it for use in 
a small silver or tin saucepan, adding a little sugar and Ma- 
deira, according to your taste. 

Almond Cream, 
Make this in the manner directed for pistachio cream, add- 
ing half a dozen bitter almonds to the sweet. 

Barley Cream, 
Take half a pint of pearl barley, and two quarts of water. 
Boil it half away, and then strain it out. Put in some juice of 
lemons ; sweeten it to your taste. Steep two ounces of sweet 
almonds in rose-water; and blanch, stamp, and strain them 
through into the barley, till it is as white as milk. 

French Barley Cream. 
Boil your barley in two or three waters, till it looks white 
and tender ; pour the water clean from the barley, and put as 
much cream as will make it tolerably thick, and a blade or two 
of mace, and let it boil. To a pint and a half of cream put two 
ounces of almonds, blanched and ground with rose-water. 
Strain them with cold cream ; put the cream through the 
almonds two or three times, wringing it hard. Sweeten to 
your taste ; let it boil ; and put it in a broad disk. 



260 CONFECTIONARY. 

(Chocolate Cream. 
Boil a quart of thick cream, scraping into it one ounce of 
chocolate. Add about a quarter of a pound of sugar; when it 
is cold put nine whites of eggs ; whisk it, and, as the froth 
rises, put it into glasses. 

Citron Cream. 
To a quarter of a pound of citron pounded put three gills 
of cream : mill it up with a chocolate-stick till the citron is 
mixed ; put it in sugar if needful. 

Clotted Cream. 
Set the milk in the usual way; when it has stood twelve 
hours, it is, without being skimmed, to be placed in a stove 
and scalded, of course not suffered to boil, and then left to 
stand again for twelve hours ; then take off the cream which 
floats at the top in lumps, for which reason it is called clotted 
cream ; it may be churned into butter ; the skim milk makes 
cheese. 

Coffee Cream, 
Take two ounces of whole coffee, one quart of cream, about 
four ounces of fine sugar, a small piece of the yellow rind of a 
lemon, with rather less than half an ounce of the best picked 
isinglass. Boil these ingredients, stirring them now and then, 
till the cream is highly flavoured with the coffee. It might, 
perhaps, be better to flavour the cream first, and then dissolve 
the isinglass and put it to it. Take it off the fire ; have ready 
the yolks of six eggs beaten, which add to the cream, and con- 
tinue to beat it till it is about lukewarm, lest the eggs should 
turn the cream. Strain the whole through a fine sieve into 
the dish in which you mean to serve it, which must be first 
fixed into a stewpan of boiling water, that will hold it so com- 
modiously, that the bottom only will touch the water, and not 
a drop of the water come to the cream. Cover the cream with 
the lid of a stewpan, and in that lid put two or three bits of 
lighted charcoal, moving them from one part to another, that 
it may all set alike ; it should only simmer. When it has done 
in this manner for a short, time, take off the cover of the stew- 
pan ; if not done enough, cover it again, and put fresh char- 
coal ; it should be done so as to form a weak jelly. Take it off, 
and keep it in a cool place till you serve it. If you wish to turn 
it out in a mould, boil more isinglass in it. Tea crcEun is made 
in the same manner. 

Eringo Cream, 
Take a quarter of a pound of eringoes, and break them into 
short pieces ; put to them a pint of milk ; let it boil till the 
eringoes are very tender ; then pour the milk from them ; put 



CONFECTIONARY. 261 

in a pint of cream to the eringoes ; let them boil ; put in an egg, 
beaten well, to thicken, and dish it up. 

Fruit Cream. 
Scald your fruit ; when done, pulp it through a sieve ; let it 
stand till almost cold ; then sweeten it to your taste ; put it 
into your cream, and make it of whatever thickness you please. 

Preserved Fruit Creams, 

Put half a pound of the pulp of any preserved fruit in a large 
pan : add to it the whites of three eggs, well beaten ; beat 
these well together for an hour. Take it off with a spoon, and 
lay it up high on the dish or glasses. Raspberries will not do 
this way. 

Italian Cream. 

Boil a pint of cream with half a pint of new milk ; when it 
boils throw in the peel of an orange and a lemon, with a 
quarter of a pound of sugar, and a small pinch of salt. When 
tibe cream is impregnated with the flavour of the fruit, mix 
and beat it with the yolks of eight eggs ; set it on the fire to 
be made equally thick ; as soon as it is thick enough for the 
eggs to be done, put into it an ounce of dissolved isinglass ; 
drain it well through a sieve : put some of the cream into a 
small mould, to see if it is thick enough : if not, add more 
isinglass. Lay this preparation in a mould in some salt or 
ice ; when it is quite stiff, and you wish to send it up, dip a 
napkin in hot water, and put it round the mould, which turn 
upside down in the dish. 

Another. 
Put two table-spoonfuls of sifted sugar, half of a gill of 
white wine, with a little brandy, a table-spoonful of lemon- 
juice, and the rind of a lemon, in a basin, with a pint of cream 
well whipped together ; put thin muslin in the shape or mould, 
and set it in a cold place, or on ice, till wanted. 

Lemon Cream. No. 1. 
Take five large lemons and rasp off all the outside ; then 
squeeze the lemons, and put what you have rasped off into the 
juice ; let it stand two or three hours, if all night the better. 
Take eight whites of eggs and one yolk, and beat them well 
together ; put to it a pint of spring water : then mix them all, 
and sweeten it with double-refined sugar according to your 
taste. Set it over a chaffing-dish of coals, stirring it till it is of 
a proper thickness ; then dish it out. Be sure not to let it boil. 



262 CONFECTIONARY. 

Lemon Cream. No. 2. 
Pare three smooth-skinnecnemona ; squeeze out the juice ; 
cut the peel in small pieces, and put it to the juice. Let it 
stand two or three hours closely covered, and, when it has 
acquired the flavour of the peel, add to it the whites of five 
eggs and the yolks of three. Beat them well with two spoon- 
fuls of orange-flower water ; sweeten with double-refined 
sugar ; strain it ; set it over a slow fire, and stir it carefully till 
it is as thick as cream ; then pour it into glasses. 

Lemon Cream, No. 3. 
Set on the fire three pints of cream ; when it is ready to boil, 
take it ofl^, and squeeze a lemon into it. Stir it up ; hsxig it up 
in a cloth, till the whey has run out ; sweeten it to your taste, 
and serve it up. 

Lemon Cream. No. 4. 
Take the sweetest cream, and squeeze in juice of lemon to 
your. taste : put it into a chum, and shake it till it rises or fer- 
ments. Sweeten it to your taste, but be sure not to put any 
sugar before you chum it, for that will hinder the fermentation. 

Lemon Cream, No. 5. 
Pare two lemons, and squeeze to them the juice of one larger 
or two smaller ; let it remain some time, and then strain the 
juice to a pint of cream, and add the yolks of four eggs beaten 
and strained ; sweeten it, and stir it over the fire till thick. 
You may add a little brandy, if agreeable. 

Lemon Cream without Cream. 
Squeeze three lemons, and put the parings into the juice ; 
cover and let it remain three hours ; beat the yolks of two eggs 
and the whites of four ; sweeten this ; add a little orange-flower 
water, and put it to the lemon-juice. Set the whole over a 
slow fire till it becomes as thick as cream, and take particular 
care not to let it boil. 

Lemon Cream frothed. 
Make a pint of cream very sweet, and add the paring of one 
lemon ; let it just boil ; put the juice of one large lemon into 
a glass or china dish, and, when the cream is nearly cold, pour 
it out of a tea-pot upon the juice, holding it as high as possible. 
Serve it up. 

Orange Cream, 
Squeeze the juice of four oranges to the rind of one ; put it 
over the fire with about a pint of cream, and take out the peel 



CONFECTIONARY. 263 

before the cream becomes bitter. Boil the cream, and, when 
cold, put to it the yolks of four eggs and the whites of three, 
beaten and strained, and sugar to your taste. Scald this, but 
keep stirring all the time, until of a proper thickness. 

Orange Cream frothed. 
Proceed in the same way as with the lemon, but put no peel 
in the cream ; merely steep a bit a short time in the juice. 

Imperial Orange Cream, 
Take a pint of thick sweet cream, and boil it with a little 
orange-peel. When it just boils, take it off the fire, and stir it 
till it is no hotter than milk from the cow. Have ready the 
juice of four Seville oranges and four lemons ; strain the juice 
through a jelly -bag, and sweeten it well with fine sugar, and 
a small spoonful of orange-flower water. Set your dish on the 
ground, and, your juice being in it, pour the cream from as great 
a height as you can, that it may bubble up on the top of the 
cream ; then set it by for five or six hours before you use it, if 
the weather is hot, but in winter it may stand a whole night. 

Pistachio Cream, 
Take a quarter of a pound of pistachio-nuts and blanch them ; 
then beat them fine with rose-water ; put them into a pint of 
cream ; sweeten it, let it just boil, and put it into glasses. 

Raspberry Cream. 
To one pint of cream put six ounces of jam, and pulp it 
through a sieve, adding the juice of a lemon ; whisk it fast at 
the edge of your dish ; lay the froth on the sieve, and add a 
little more of the juice. When no more froth will rise, put 
your cream into a dish or cups ; heap the froth well on. 

Ratafia Cream, 
Boil three or. four laurel-leaves in one pint of cream, and 
strain it ; when cold, add the yolks of three eggs beaten and 
strained ; then sweeten it ; put in it a very little brandy ; scald 
it till thicks and keep stirring it all the time. 

Rice Cream, 
Boil a quart of milk with a laurel -leaf ; pour it on five dessert 
spoonf ids of ground rice ; let it stand two hours ; then put it 
into a saucepan, and bodl it till it is tender, with rather less 
than a quarter of a pound of sugar. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
and put them into it when it is almost cold ; and then boU till 



264 CONFECTIONARY. 

it is as thick as a cream. When it is sent to tahle, put in a 
few ratafia hiscuits. 

• Runnet Whey Cream. 

Turn new milk from the cow with runnet ; press the whey 
from it; beat the curd in a mdHar till it is quite smooth; then 
mix it with thick cream, and froth it with a froth-stick ; add a 
little powdered sugar. 

Snow Cream, 

Sweeten the whites of four eggs, add a pint of thick sweet 
cream and a g )od spoonful of brandy. Whisk this well toge- 
ther ; take off the froth, and lay it upon a sieve ; when all the 
froth that wiU rise is taken off, pour what has run through to 
the rest. Stir lit over a slow fire, and let it just boil ; fill your 
glasses about mree parts full, and lay on the froth. 

J Strawberry Cream, 

Exactly the same as raspberry. 

Sweetmeat Cream, 
Slice preserved peaches, apricots, or plums, into good cream, 
sweetening it with fine sugar, or the syrup in which they were 
preserved. Mix these well together, and put it into glasses. 

WTiipt Cream, to put upon Cake, 
Sweeten a pint of cream to your taste ; grate in the peel of 
a lemon, and steep it some hours before you make use of your 
cream. Add the juice of two lemons ; whip it together ; and 
take off the top into a large piece of fine muslin, or gauze, laid 
within a sieve. Let this be done the night before it is to be 
used. In summer it may be done in the morning of the same 
day; but the whipt cream must be drained from the curd 
before it is put upon the cake. 

Cucumbers, to preserve green. 
Take fine large green cucumbers ; put them in salt and 
water till they are yellow ; then green them over fresh salt and 
water in a little roch alum. Cover them close with abundance 
of vine leaves, changing the leaves as they become yell6w. 
Put in some lemon-juice ; and, when the cucumbers are of a 
fine green, take them off and scald them several times with hot 
water, or make a very thin syrup, changing it till the raw taste 
of the cucumbers is t^en away. Then make a syrup thus: to 
a pound of cucumbers take one pound and a half of double- 
refined sugar ; leave out the half poimd to add to them when 
boiled up again ; put lemon- peel, ginger cut in slices, white 



CONFECTIONARY. 265 

orris root, and any thing else you like to flavour with ; boil it 
well ; when cool, put it to the cucumbers, and let them remain 
a few days. Boil up the syrup with the remainder of the 
sugar ; continue to heat the syrup till they look clear. Just 
before you take the syrup off, add lemon-juice to your taste. 

Cream Curd, 
Boil a pint of cream, with a little mace, cinnamon, and rose- 
water, and, when as cool as new milk, put in half a spoonful of 
good runnet. When it turns, serve it up in the cream dish. 

Lemon Curd. 

To a pint of cream, when it boils, put in the whites of six 
eggs, and one lemon and a half; stir it until it comes to a ten- 
der curd. Then put it into a holland bag, and let it drain till 
all the whey is out of it; beat the curd in a mortar with a little 
sugar ; put it in a basin to form ; about two or three hours 
before you use it, turn it out, and pour thick cream and sugar 
over it. ^ 

Paris Curd, 

Put a pint of cream on the fire, with the juice of one lemon, 
and the whites of six eggs ; stir it till it becomes a curd. Hang 
it all night in a cloth to drain ; then add to it two ounces of 
sweet almonds, with brandy and sugar to your taste. Mix it 
well in a mortar, and put it into shapes. 

Currants, to bottle. 
Gather your fruit perfectly dry, and not too ripe ; cut each 
currant from the stalk separately, taking care not to bruise 
them ; fill your bottles quite full, cork them lightly, set them 
in a boiler with cold water, and let them simmer a quarter of 
an hour, or according to the nature and ripeness of the fruit. 
By this process the fruit will sink ; pour on as much boiling 
water as will cover the surface and exclude air. Should they 
mould, move it off when you use the fruit, and you will not 
find the fruit injured by it. Cork your bottles quickly, after 
you take them out of the water; tie a bladdet over, and put 
them in a dry place. This method answers equally well for 
gooseberries, cherries, greengages, and damsons. 

Another way. 
Gather the currants quite dry ; clip them off the stalks ; if 
they burst in pulling off they will not do. Fill some dry com- 
mon quart bottles with them, rosin the corks well over, and 
then tie a bladder well soaked over the cork, and upon the 

N 



266 CONFECTIONARY. 

leather ; all this is ahsolutely necessary to keep the air out« and 
ccfrks in ; place the bottles, with the corks downwards, in a 
boiler of cold water, and stuff hay between them to keep them 
steady. Make a fire under them, and keep it up till the water 
boils ; then rake it out immediately, and leave the bottles in the 
boiler till the water is quite cold. Put them into the cellar in 
any vessel that will keep them steadily packed, the necks always 
downward. When a bottle is opened, the currants must be 
used at once. The bottles will not be above half full when 
taken out of the boiler, and they must not be shaken more than 
can be avoided. 

This process answers equally well for apricots, plums, and 
cherries. 

Currants or Barberries, to dry in bunches. 

When the currants, or barberries, (which should be maiden 
barberries) are stoned and tied up in bunches, take to one pound 
of them a poimd and a half of sugar. To each pound of sugar 
put half a pint of water ; boil the syrup well, and put the fruit 
into it. Set it on the fire ; let it just boil, ^gd thentcdce it off. 
Cover it close with white paper ; let it stand till next day; then 
make it scalding hot, and let it stand two or three days, covered 
close with paper. Lay it in earthen plates ; sprinkle over it 
fine sugar, put it on a stove to dry ; lay it on sieves till one 
side is dry ; then turn and sift sugar on it. When dry enough 
lay it between papers. . 

Currants, to ice, ■- 

Take the largest and finest bunches of currants you can get; 
beat the white of an egg to a froth; dip them into it ; lay them, 
so as not to touch, upon a sieve : sift double-refined sugar over 
them very thick, and let them dry in a stove or oven. 

White Currants, to preserve. 
Take the largest white currants, but not the amber colour ; 
strip them, and to two quarts of currants put a pint of water ; boil 
them very fast, and run them through a jelly-bag to a pint of 
juice. Put a pound and half of sugar, and half a pound of 
stoned currants ; set them on a brisk fire, and let them boil 
very fast till the currants are clear and jelly very well ; then 
put them into glasses or pots, stirring them as they cool, to 
make them mix well. Paper them down when just cold. 

Red Currants, to preserve. 
Mash the currants and strain them through a thin strainer ; 
to a pint of juice take a pound and a half of sugar and six 
spoonfuls of water. Boil it up and skim it well. Put in half 



CONFECTIONARY. 267 

a pound of stoned currants ; boil them as fast as you can, till 
the currants are clear and jelly well ; then put them into pots 
or glasses, and, "when cold, paper them as other sweetmeats. 
Stir all small fruits as they cool, to mix them with the jelly. 

Another way. 
Take red and white currants ; squeeze and drain them. Boil 
two pints of juice with three pounds of fine sugar : skim it; 
then put in a pound of stoned currants ; let them boil fast 
till they jelly, and put them into bottles. 

Currant Jam, 
To a pound of currants put three quarters of a pound of 
lump sugar. Put the fruit first into the preserving-pan, and 
place the sugar carefully in the middle, so as not to touch the pan. 
Let it boil gently on a clear fire for about half an hour. It must 
not be stirred. Skim the jelly carefully from the top, and add 
a quarter of a pound of fruit to what remains from the jelly ; 
stir it well, and boil it thoroughly. The proportion of fruit 
added for the jam must always be one quarter. In making 
jelly or jam, it is an improvement to add to every five pounds 
of currants one pound of raisins. 

Currant Jam or Jelly, 
Take two pounds of currants and half a pound of raspberries : 
to every potind of fruit add three quarters of a pound of good 
moist sugar. Simmer them slowly ; skim the jam very nicely ; 
when boiled to a sufficient consistency, put it into jars, and, 
when cold, cover with brandy paper. 

Black or red Currant Jelly, 

Strip the fruit when full ripe ; put it into a stone jar ; put 
the jar, tied over with white paper, into a saucepan of cold 
water, and stew it to boiling on the stove. Strain off the 
liquor, and to every pint of red currants weigh out a pound of 
loaf-sugar, if black, three quarters of a pound ; mix the fruit 
and the sugar in lumps, and let it rest till the sugar is nearly 
dissolved. Then put it in a preserving-pan, and simmer and 
skim it till it is quite clear. When it will jelly on a plate, it is 
done, and may be put in pots. 

Currant Juice, 

Take currants, and squeeze the juice out of them ; have some 
very dry quart bottles, and hold in each a couple of burning 
matches. Cork them up, to keep the smoke confined in them 
for a few hours, till the juice is put in them. Fill them to the 

N 2 



268 CONFECTIONARY. 

neck with the currant juice ; then- scald them in a copper or 
pot with hay hetween. The water must be cold when the bottles 
are put in ; let them have one boil. 

Another way. 

Boil a pint of currant juice with half a pint of clarified su- 
gar ; skim it ; add a little lemon to taste, and mix with a quart 
of seed. 

Currant Paste, 

Mash red and white currants ; strain them through a linen 
bag ; break in as much of the strained currants as will make 
the juice thick enough of seeds ; add some gooseberries boiled 
in water. Boil the whole till it jellies ; let it stand to cool ; 
then put a pound of sugar to every pint, and scald it. 

Custard, No. 1 . 
One quart of cream, twelve eggs, the whites of four, the 
rind of one lemon, boiled in the cream, with a small quantity 
of nutmeg, and a bay-leaf, bitter and sweet almonds one ounce 
each, a little ratafia and orange-flower water ; sweeten to your 
taste. The cream must be quite cold before the eggs are added. 
When mixed, it must just be made to boil, and then fill your cups. 

Custard, No. 2. 
Take one pint of cream, boil in it a few laurel-leaves, a stick 
of cinnamon, and the rind of a lemon ; when nearly cold, add 
the yolks of seven eggs, well beaten, and six ounces of lump 
sugar ; let it nearly boil ; keep stirring it all the while, and 
till nearly cold, and add a little brandy. 

Custard, No. 3. 

A quart of cream, and the yolks of nine eggs, sugared to 
your taste; if eggs are scarce, take seven and three whites; it 
must not quite boil, or it will curdle ; keep it stirred all the time 
over a slow fire. When it is nearly cold, add three table-spoon- 
fuls of ratafia ; stir till cold, otherwise it will turn. It is best 
without any white of eggs. 

Custard, No. 4. 

Take a pint of cream ; blanch a few sweet almonds, and beat 
them fine ; sweeten to your palate. Beat up the yolks of five 
eggs, stir all together, one way, over the fire, till it is thick. 
Add laurel-leaves, bitter almonds, or ratafia, to give it a fla- 
vour ; then put it into cups. 

Custard. No. 5. 

Make some rice, nicely boiled, into a good wall round your 
trifle dish ; strew the rice over with pink comfits ; then pour 



CONFECTIONARY. 269 

good custard into the rice, frame, and stripe it across with 
pink and blue comfits alternately. 

Almond Custard, 
Blanch and pound fine, with half a gill of rose-water, six 
ounces of sweet and half an ounce of bitter almonds ; boil a 
pint of milk ; sweeten it with two ounces and a half of sugar; 
rub the almonds through a sieve, with a pint of cream ; strain 
the milk to the yolks of eight eggs, well beaten — three whites 
if thought necessary — stir it over a fire till of a good thickness ; 
when off the fire, stir it till nearly cold to prevent its curdling . 

To bottle Damsons. 

Take ripe fruit ; wipe them dry, and pick off the stalks; fill 
your bottles with them. The bottles must be very clean and 
dry. Put the corks lightly into them, to keep out the steam 
when simmering : then set them up to the necks in cold water, 
and let them simmer a quarter of an hour, but not boil, or the 
fruit will crack. Take them out, and let them stand all night. 
Next day, cork them tight, rosin the corks, and keep them in 
a dry place. 

Damsons, to dry. 

Pick out the finest damsons, and wipe them clean. To every 
pound of fruit take half a pound of sugar ; wet the damsons 
with water ; and put them into the sugar with the insides 
downward. Set them on the fire till the sugar is melted ; let 
them lie in the sugar till it has thoroughly penetrated them, 
heating them once a day. When you take them out, dip them 
in hot water, and lay them to dry. 

Damsons y to preserve without Sugar, 
, When the damsons are quite ripe, wipe them ^ eparately, and 
put them into stone jars. Set them in an oven four or five 
times after the bread is drawn. When the skins shrivel they 
are done enough ; if they shrink much, you must fill up the jar 
with more fruit, and cover them at last with melted suet. 

Dripping, to clarify for Crust, 
Boil beef dripping in water for a few minutes ; let it stand 
till cold, when it will come off in a cake. It makes good crust 
for the kitchen. 

Dumplings, 
Take of stale bread, suet, and loaf-sugar, half a pound each ; 
make the whole so fine as to go through a sieve. Mix it 
with lemon-juice, and add the rind of a lemon finely grated. 



270 CONFECTIONARY. 

Make it up into dumplings, and pour over them sweet sauce 
without wine. 

Currant Dumplings, 
A quarter of a pound of apple, a quarter of a pound of cur- 
rants, three eggs, some sugar, bitter ahnonds, lemon or orange 
peel, and a little nutmeg. Boil an hour and a half. 

Drop Dumplings, 

To a piece of fresh butter, of the size of an egg, take three 
spoonfuls of flour, and three yolks of eggs ; stir the butter and 
eggs well together ; add a little salt and nutmeg, and then put 
the flour to it. Drop the batter with a small spoon into boil- 
ing water, and let it boil four or five minutes ; pour the water 
from the dumplings, and eat them with a ragout, or as a dish 
by itself. 

Another way. 

Break two eggs into half a pint of milk, and beat them up ; 
mix with flour, and put a little salt. Set on the fire a saucepan 
with water, and, when it boils, drop the batter in with a large 
Bpoon, and boil them quick for five minutes. Take them out 
carefully with a slice, lay them on a sieve for a minute to dry, 
put them into a dish, cut a piece of butter in thin slices, and 
stir among them. Send them up as hot as you can. 

Kitchen hard Dumplings, 
Mix flour and water with a little salt into a stiff paste. Put 
in a few currants for change, and boil them for halSf an hour. 
It improves them much to boil them with beef or pork. 

Vest Dumplings, 
A table- spoonful of yest, three handfuls of flour, mix with 
water and a little salt. Boil ten minutes in a deep pot, and 
cover with water when they rise. The dough to be made about 
the size of an apple. The quantity mentioned above will make 
a dozen of the proper size. 

Another way. 
Make nice light dough, by putting your flour into a platter ; 
make a hollow in the middle of it, and pour in a little good 
small beer warmed, an egg well beaten, and some warm milk 
and water. Strew salt upon the flour, but not upon the mix- 
ture in the middle, or it will not do well. Then make it into 
as light a dough as you can, and set it before the fire, covered 
with a cloth, a couple of hours, to rise. Make it into large 
dumplings, and set them before the fire six or seven minutes ; 



CONFECTIONARY. 27 1 

then put them into boiling water with a little milk in it. A 
quarter of an hour will do them. 
Eggs. 
Eggs left till cold will reheat to the same degree as at first. 
For instance, an egg boiled three minutes and left till cold 
will reheat in the same time and not be harder. It may be 
useful to know this when fresh eggs are scarce. 

Whites of Eggs. 
Beat up the whites of twelve eggs with rose-water, some 
fine grated lemon-peel, and nutmeg ; sweeten to your taste, and 
well mix the whole. Boil it in four bladders, tied up in the 
shape of an egg, till hard ; they will take half an hour. When 
cold, lay them in a dish ; mix half a pint of good cream, a gill 
of sack, and half the juice of a Seville orange ; sweeten and 
mix it well, and pour it over the eggs. 

Another way. 

Beat two whites in a plate in a cool place till quite stiff and 
they look like snow. Lay it on the lid of a stewpan ; put it 
in a cool oven, and bake it of a light brown for about ten 
minutes. 

Figs, to dry. 

Take figs when thoroughly ripe, pare them very thin, and 
slit them at the top. To one pound of fruit put three quarters 
of a pound of sugar, and to the sugar a pint of water ; boil 
the syrup at first a little, skim it very clean, and set it over 
coals to keep it warm. Have ready some warm water, and 
when it boils put in your figs ; let them boil till tender ; then 
take them up by the stalk, and drain them clean from water. 
Put them into the syrup over the fire for two or three hours, 
turning them frequently ; do the same morning and evening, 
keeping them warm, for nine days, till you find them begin to 
candy. Then lay them out upon glasses. Turn them often 
the first day, on the next twice only ; they will quickly dry if 
they are well attended to. A little ambergris or musk gives 
the fruit a fine flavour. Peaches and plums may be done the 
same way. 

Small Flowers, to candy. 

Take as much fine sugar as you think likely to cover the 
flowers, and wet it for a candy. When boiled pretty thick, 
put in your flowers, and stir, but be careful not to bruise them. 
Keep them over the fire, but do not let them boil till they are 
pretty dry ; then rub the sugar off with your hands as soon as 
you can, and take them out. 



272 CONFECTIONARY. 

Flowers in sprigs, to candy. 
Dissolve gum arable in water, and let it be pretty thin ; wet 
the flowers in it, and put them in a cloth to dry. When nearly 
dry, dip them all over in finely sifted sugar, and hang them up 
before the fire, or, if it should be a fine sunshiny day, hang 
them in the sun till they are thoroughly dry, and then take 
them down. The same may be done to marjoram and mint. 

Dutch Flummery, 

Steep two ounces of isinglass two hours in a pint of boiling 
water ; take a pint of white wine, the yolks of eight eggs, well 
beaten, the juice of four lemons, with the rind of one. Sweeten 
it to your taste ; set it over the fire, and keep it stirring till 
it boils. 

Hartshotn Flummery . No. 1. 

Take half a pound of hartshorn ; boil it in four quarts of 
water, till reduced to one quarter or less; let it stand all 
night. Blanch a quarter of a pound of almonds, and beat 
them small ; melt the jelly, mix with it the almonds, strained 
through a thin strainer or hair sieve ; then put a quarter of a 
pint of cream, a little cinnamon, and a blade of mace ; boil 
these together, and sweeten* it. Put it into china cups, and, 
when you use it, turn it out of the cups, and eat it with cream. 

Hartshorn Flummery, No. 2. 
Put one pound of hartshorn shavings to three quarts of 
spring water ; boil it very gently over a slow fire till it is 
reduced to one quart, then strain it through a fine sieve into a 
basin ; let it stand till cold ; then just melt it, and put to it 
haK a pint of white wine, a pint of good thick cream, and four 
spoonfuls of orange-flower water. Scald the cream, and let 
it be cold before you mix it with the wine and jelly ; sweeten 
it with double-refined sugar to your taste, and then beat it all 
one way for an hour and a half at least, for, if you are not 
careful in thus beating, it will neither mix nor even look to 
please you. Dip the moulds first in water, that they may turn 
out well. Keep the flummery in cups a day before you use it ; 
when you serve it, stick it with blanched almonds, cut in thin 
slices. Calves* feet may serve instead of hartshorn shavings. 

Hartshorn Flummery. No. 3. 

Take one pound of hartshorn shavings, and put to it three 

quarts of water ; boil it till it is half consumed ; then strain 

and press out the hartshorn, and set it by to cool. Blanch 

four ounces of almonds in cold water, and beat tliem very fine 



CONFECTIONARY. 273 

with a little rose and orange-flower water. Make the jelly as 
warm as new milk, and sweeten it to your taste with the best 
sugar ; put it by degrees to the almonds, and stir it very well 
until they are thoroughly mixed. Then wring it through a 
cloth, put it into cups, and set it by to jelly. Before you turn 
them out, dip the outside in a little warm water to loosen 
them; stick them with blanched almonds, cut in thin long 
pieces. Three ounces of sweet almonds, and one of apricot 
or peach kernels, make ratafia flummery. If you have none of 
the latter, use bitter almonds. 

Fondues. 

Boil a quarter of a pound of crumb of bread in milk ; beat it 
with a wooden spoon ; grate half a pound of Cheshire cheese, 
add the yolks of three eggs, and a quarter of a pound of but- 
ter ; beat all well together. Beat up three whites of eggs to a 
thick froth ; pu^ this in last, and beat the whole well together. 
Bake in two paper cases or a dish, in a quick oven, for twenty 
minutes. 

Yorkshire Fritters, 

To two quarts of flour take two spoonfuls of yest, mixed 
with a little warm milk. T^et it rise. Take nine eggs, leav- 
ing out four whites, and temper your dough to the consistence 
of paste. Add currants or apples, and a little brandy or rose- 
water. Roll the fritters thin, and fry them in lard. 

Fruity to preserve. 
Strip the fruit, put it into a stone jar, set the jar in a sauce- 
pan of water, and stew it to boiling on the stove. Strain off 
the liquor, and to every pint allow a pound of loaf sugar. 
Mix the fruit and the sugar in lumps in a stone vessel, but not 
till the sugar is nearly dissolved : then put it in a preserving- 
pan, and simmer and strain it till it is quite clear. When it 
will jelly on a plate, it is done, and may be put into pots. 

Fruity to preserve green. 
Take green pippins, pears, plums, apricots, or peaches ; put 
them into a preserving-pan ; cover them with vine-leaves, and 
then with clear spring water. Put on the cover of the pan, 
and set them over a very clear fire ; take them off as soon as 
they begin to simmer, and take them carefully out with a slice. 
Then peel and preserve them as other fruit. 

Fruit of all sorts, to scald. 
Put your fruit into scaJding water, sufficient nearly to cover 
it ; set it over a slow fire, and keep it in a scald till tender, 

n5 



274 CONFECTIONARY. 

turning the fruit where the water does not cover. When it is 
very tender, lay paper close to it, and let it stand till it is cold. 
Then, to a pound of fruit put half a pound of sugar, and let it 
boil, but not too fast, till it looks clear. All fruit must be done 
whole, excepting pippins, and they are best in halves or quar- 
ters, with a little orange-peel and the juice of lemon. 

Gingerbread. No. 1. 
To a pound and a half of flour add one pound of treacle, 
almost as much sugar, an ounce of beaten ginger, two ounces 
of caraway seeds, four ounces of citron and lemon -peel candied, 
and the yolks of four eggs. Cut your sweetmeats, mix all, and 
bake it in large cakes, or tin plates. 

Gingerbread. No. 2. 
Into one pound and a half of flour work three quarters of a 
pound of butter ; add three quarters of a pound of treacle, two 
ounces of sugar, half an ounce of ginger, a little orange-peel 
beaten and sifted. Some take a pound and a quarter of treacle 
and two ounces of ginger. 

Gingerbread. No. 3. 
Two pounds of flour, two ounces of caraway seeds, one tea- 
spoonful of powdered ginger, half a spoonful of allspice, and 
the same of pearl-ash, two ounces of preserved orange, the 
same of lemon-peel, and half a poimd of butter ; mix these 
ingredients well together, and make it into a stifi" paste with trea- 
cle, as stifl'as you would make paste for a tart ; then put it before 
the fire to rise for one hour, after which you may roll it out, 
and cut it into cakes, or mould it, as you like. 

Gingerbread. No. 4. 
Take a pound of treacle and half a pound of butter ; melt 
them together over a fire ; have ready a pound and a half of 
flour well dried, into which put at least half an ounce of ginger 
well beaten and sifted, as many coriander seeds, half a potmd 
of sugar, a little brandy, and some candied orange-peel ; then 
mix the warm treacle and butter with the flour ; make it into 
flat cakes, and bake it upon tins. 

Gingerbread. No. 5. 

Two pounds of flour well dried, one pound of treacle, one 

pound of sugar, one nutmeg, four ounces of sweetmeats, one 

ounce of beaten ginger, one pound of fresh butter, melted with 

the treacle, and poured hot upon the other ingredients ; make 



CONFECTIONARY. 275 

it into a paste, and let it lie till quite cold; then roll it out, and 
bake it in a slow oven. 

Gingerbread. No. 6. 
One pound of treacle, the same weight of flour, butter and 
sugar of each a quarter of a pound, ginger and candied lemon- 
peel of each half an ounce. Rub the butter, ginger, and sugar, 
well together, before you put in the treacle. 

Thick Gingerbread, 
To a pound and a half of flour take one pound of treacle, 
almost as much sugar, an ounce of beaten ginger, two ounces 
of caraway seed, four ounces of citron and lemon-peel candied, 
and the yolks of four eggs. Cut the sweetmeats ; well mix the 
whole ; and bake in large cakes on tin plates. 

Gingerbread Cakes or Nuts, 
Melt half a pound of butter, and put to it half a pound of 
treacle, two spoonfuls of brandy, and six oimces of coarse brown 
sugar. Mix sdl these together in a saucepan, and let the whole 
be milk warm; then put it to a pound and a quarter of flour, 
half an ounce of ginger, some orange-peel finely grated, 
and as much candied orange as you like. 

Gingerbread Nuts. 

A quarter of a pound of treacle, the same of flour, one ounce 
of butter, a little brown sugar, and some ginger. Mix all 
together, and bake the nuts on tins. Sweetmeat is a great 
addition. 

Gooseberries, to bottle. 

Pick them in dry weather before they are too large ; cut 
them at both ends with scissars, that they may not be broken; 
put them into very dry bottles, and fill them up to the neck 
with cold spring water. Put the bottles up to their necks in 
water, in a large fish-kettle, set it on the fire, and scald them. 
Take it off immediately when you perceive the gooseberries 
change colour. Next day, if the bottles require filling, have 
ready some cold spring water which has been boiled, and fill 
half way up the neck of the bottles; then pour in a little sweet 
oil, just sufficient to cover the water at the top of the bottle, 
and tie them over with a bladder. 

Gooseberries in Jelly. 
Make as much thick syrup as will cover the quantity of 
gooseberries you intend to do ; boil and skim it clear : set it 
by till almost cold. Have ready some green hairy gooseber- 



276 CONFECTIONARY. 

ries, not quite ripe, and the skins of which are still rather hard; 
cut off the remains of the flower at one end, leaving the little 
stalk on at the other ; with a small penknife slit down the side, 
and with the point of the knife carefully remove the seeds, 
leaving the pulp. Put the gooseberries into the syrup when 
lukewarm ; set it on the fire, shake it frequently, but do not 
let it boil. Take it off, and let the gooseberries stand all night : 
with a spoon push them under the syrup, or cover them with 
white paper. Next day set them on the fire, scald them again, 
but they must not boil, and shake them as before. Proceed in 
the same manner a third time. The jelly to put them in must 
be made thus : Take three pints of the sharpest gooseberries 
you can get — they must be of the white sort — to one pint of 
water ; and the quantity you make of this jelly must of course 
be proportioned to that of the fruit. Boil them half an hour, 
till all the flavour of the fruit is extracted ; strain off the liquor; 
let it settle, pour off the clear, and to each pint add one pound 
of double-refined sugar. Boil it till it jellies, which you may 
see by putting a little into a spoon or cup. Put a little of the 
jelly at the bottom of the pot to prevent the gooseberries from 
sinking to the bottom ; when it is set, put in the rest of the 
gooseberries and jelly. When cold, cover with brandy paper. 

Gooseberries t to preserve. 

Pick the white gooseberries, stamp and strain them ; then 
take the largest of them when they just begin to turn ; stone 
them, and to half a pound of gooseberries put a pound of the 
finest sugar, and beat it very fine. Take half a pound of the 
juice which you have strained; let it stand to settle clear ; and 
set it, with six spoonfuls of water, on a quick fire ; boil it as 
fast as you can ; when you see the sugar, as it boils, look clear, 
they are enough; which will be in less than a quarter of an hour. 
Put them in glasses or pots, and paper them close. Next day, 
if they are not jellied hard enough, set them for a day or two 
in a hot stove, or in some warm place, but not in the sun ; 
and, when jellied, put the papers close to them after being wetted 
and dried with a cloth. 

Another way. 

Stone your gooseberries, and as you stone them put them 
into water : then weigh them, and to eight ounces of goose- 
berries take twelve ounces of double-refined sugar. Put as 
much water as will make it a pretty thick syrup, and when 
boiled and skimmed let it cool a little ; then put the gooseber- 
ries into the syrup, and boil them quick, till they look clear. 
Take them out one by one, and put them into glass bottles ; 



CONFECTIONARY. 277 

then heat the syrup a little, strain it through muslini pour it 
on the fruit, and it will jelly when cold. 

Gooseberry Paste. 
Pick off the eyes of the gooseberries, and put them in water 
scarcely sufficient to cover them ; let them boil, and rub them 
through a sieve. Boil up a candy of sugar; put in your 
paste, and just scald it a little. Add one pound of sugar to a 
pint of the paste, and put into pots to dry in the stove : when 
candied over, turn them out on glasses. 

Grapes, to dry. 

Scald bunches of grapes in water till they will peel ; when 
they are peeled and stoned, put them into fresh cold water, cover 
them up close, and set them over the fire till they begin to green:. 
Then take them out of the water and put them to the syrupi 
after it has been well skimmed. Cut a paper that will exactly 
fit the skillet, and let it rest upon the syrup. Cover the skillet, 
and set it over a slow fire, till the grapes look green ; put them 
into a thicker syrup, and, when they are as green as you wish 
them to be, take them out of the syrup, and let them dry in 
the stove in bunches. 

Grapes y to preserve. 

Stone your grapes, and peel off the skin; cover them and no 
more with codling jelly, and let them boil fast up : then take 
them off the fire, let them stand until they are cold, and boil 
them again till they become green. Put a pound of sugar to a 
pint of the grapes, and let them boil fast till they jelly. 

Greengages, to preserve, 
[ Gather the plums before they are too ripe, and take as much 
pump water as will cover them. Put to the water a quarter 
of a pound of double-refined sugar, boil it, and let it stand to 
be cold. Prick the greengages with a large needle in four 
places to the stone ; wrap each of them lightly in a vine-leaf, 
and set them over a slow fire to green. Do so for three days 
Tunning ; on the last day, put in a spoonful of old verjuice or 
lemon-juice, and a small lump of alum. Next day draw them, 
and, after taking off the vine -leaves, put them in a thick S)n'up, 
first boiled and cleared. Finish them by degrees, by heating 
them a little every day till they look clear. 

Another way. 
Stone and split the fruit without taking off the skin. Weigh 
an equal quantity of sugar and fruit, and strew part of the 



278 CONFECTIONARY. 

feugar over the greengages, having first laid them on dishes, 
with the hollow part uppermost. Take the kernels from the 
stones, peel and blanch them. The next day, pour ofi" the 
syrup from the fruit, and boil it very gently with the other 
sugar eight minutes. Skim it, and add the fruit and kernels. 
Simmer the whole till quite clear, taking off any scum that 
rises. Put the fruit, one by one, into small pots, and pour 
the syrup and kernels to it» 

Hartshorn Jelly, 
Boil one pound of hartshorn shavings over a very gentle fire, 
in two quarts of water, till it is reduced to one quart ; let it 
■ettle, and strain it off. Put to this liquor the whites of eight 
or nine eggs, and four or five of their shells, broken very fine, 
the whites weU beaten, the juice of seven or eight lemons, or 
part oranges ; sweeten with the best sugar, and add above a 
pint of Rhenish or Lisbon wine. Mix all these well together, 
and boil over a quick fire, stirring all the time with a whisk. 
As soon as it boils up, strain it through a flannel bag, throw* 
ing it backward and forward till it is perfectly clear. Boil 
lemon-peel in it to flavour it. The last time of passing it 
through the bag, let it drip into the moulds or glasses. 

Hedgehog, 
Blanch two quarts of the best almonds in cold water ; beat them 
Very fine in a mortar, with a little canary wine and orange- 
flower water ; make them into a stiff paste ; then beat in the 
yolks of twelve eggs, leaving out five whites ; add a pint of 
good cream ; sweeten to your taste, and put in half a pound of 
good butter melted. Set it on a slow fire, and keep it con- 
stantly stirring till it is stiff enough. Make it up into the 
form of a hedgehog ; stick it full of blanched almonds, slit 
and stuck up like the bristles ; put it in a dish, and make harts- 
horn jelly, and put to it, or cold cream, sweetened with a glass 
of white wine, and the juice of a Seville orange ; plump two 
currants for the eyes. 

Ice and Cream, 
Mix a little cream and new milk together in a dish ; put in 
runnet, as for cheesecakes ; stir it together. Pour in some 
canary wine and sugar. Then put the whites of three eggs and 
a little rose-water to a pint of cream ; whip it up to a froth 
with a whisk, and, as it rises, put it upon the runnet and milk. 
Lay in here and there bunches of preserved barberries, rasp- 
berry jam, or any thing of that sort you please. Whip up more 
froth, and put over the whole. 



CONFECTIONARY. 279 

Lemon Ice. 
Grate the peel of two lemons on sugar, and put it into a 
bowl, with the juice of four lemons squeezed, and well stir it 
about ; then sweeten it with clarified sugar to your taste, and 
add to it three spoonfuls of water. Throw over a little salt on 
the ice ; put the ice in the bottom of the pail ; put the ice-pot 
On it, and cover it also with ice. Turn the pot continuaUy, 
and in about a minute or two open it, and continue to stir it 
till it is frozen enough ; after this stir every now and then. 

Iceingfor Cakes, 
Beat the white of an ^^^ to a strong froth; put in by degrees 
four ounces of fine sugar, beaten and sifted very fine, with as 
much gum as will lie on a sixpence. Beat it up for half aa 
hour, and lay it over your cakes the thickness of a straw. 

Another, 

Take the whites of four eggs and a pound of double-refined 
sugar, pounded and sifted ; beat the eggs a little ; put the sugar 
in, and whip it as fast as possible ; then wash your cake with 
rose-water, and lay the iceing on ; set it in the oven with the 
lid down till it is hard. 

Jaunemange. 

Steep two ounces of isinglass for an hour in a pint of boil- 
ing water ; put to it three quarters of a pint of white wine, the 
juice of two oranges and one lemon, the peel of a lemon cut 
very fine, and the yolks of eight eggs. Sweeten and boil it 
all together ; strain it in a mould, and, when cold, turn it out. 
Make it the day before you use it. 

Another way. 
One ounce of isinglass, dissolved in a good half pint of 
water, the juice of two small lemons, the peel of half a lemon, 
the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, half a pound of sugar, half 
a pint of white , wine : mix these carefully together, and stir 
them into the isinglass jelly over the fire. Let it simmer a few 
minutes ; when a little cool, pour it into your moulds, taking 
care to wet them first ; turn it out the next day. 

Coloured Jelly, to mix with or garnish other Jelly, 
Pare four lemons as thin as possible ; put the rinds into a 
pint and a half of water; let them lie twelve hours : then 
squeeze the lemons ; put the water and juice together ; add 
three quarters of a pound of the best sugar, but if the lemons 
are large, it will require more sugar. When the sugar is quite 



2S0 CONFECTIONARY. 

melted, beat up the whites of six new-laid eggs to a froth j 
mix all together, and strain it through a hair sieve into a 
saucepan ; set it on a slow fire, and keep it stirred till it is 
near boiling and grows thick. Then take it off, and keep 
stirring it the same way till it cools. The colouring is to be 
steeped in a cup of water, and then strained into the other 
ingredients. Care must be taken to stir it always one way. 
The eggs are the last thing put in ; the whole must be well 
mixed with a whisk till thoroughly incorporated. 

Gloucester Jelly . 
Of rice, sago, pearl barley, candied eringo root, of each one 
ounce ; add two quarts of water ; simmer it over the fire tiD it 
is reduced to one quart ; strain it. This will produce a strong 
jelly ; a little to be dissolved in white wine' or warm milk, and 
to be taken three or four times a day. 

.Another way. 
Pearl barley, whole rice, sago, and candied eringo root, of 
each one ounce, and half an ounce of hartshorn shavings, put 
into two quarts of spring water; simmer very gently till 
reduced to one quart, and then rub it through a fine sieve. 
Half a coffee-cup to be taken with an equal quantity of milk 
in a morning fasting, and lie an hour after it, and to be taken 
twice more in the day. You may then put a small quantity of 
wine or brandy instead of milk. 

Lemon Jelly, 
Put the juice of four lemons, and the rind pared as thin as 
possible, into a pint of spring water, and let it stand for half an 
hour. Take the whites of five eggs ; sweeten, and strain through 
a flannel bag. Set it over a slow fire, and stir it one way till 
it begins to thicken. You may then put it in glasses or dishes, 
and colour with turmeric. 

Nourishing Jelly, 

Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in a quart of port wine, 
with some cinnamon and sugar : sweeten to your taste with 
the best white sugar. It must not be suffered to boil, and will 
take two or three hours to dissolve, as the fire must be very 
slow ; stir it often to prevent its boiling. It must be taken 
cold. 

Orange Jelly, No. 1 . 

Squeeze the juice of nine or ten China oranges and one 
Seville orange through a sieve into an earthen pan, adding a 



.CONFECTIONARY. 281 

quarter of a pound of double-refined sugar. Take an ounce 
and a half, good weight, of the best isinglass, the peel of seven 
of the oranges grated, and the bitter squeezed out through a 
towel ; boil this peel in the isinglass, which must be put over 
the fire in about a pint of water just to melt it. Stir it all the 
time it is on the fire ; strain and pour it to the juice of the 
oranges, which boil together for about ten minutes. When you 
take it off, strain it again, and put it into moulds. 

Orange Jelly. No. 2. 
Set on the fire one ounce of isinglass in a quarter of a pint 
of warm water till it is entirely dissolved. Take the juice of 
nine oranges ; strain off clear half a pint of mountain wine, 
sweetened with lump sugar to your taste, and colour it with a 
very little cochineal. Boil all together for a few minutes, and 
strain it through a flannel bag, till it is quite clear : pour it to 
the peels, and let it stand till it is a stiff jelly. 

Orange Jelly, No. 3. 
One ounce of isinglass, dissolved in a pint of water, the 
juice of six China oranges, a bit of the rind, pared thin, sweet- 
ened to the taste, scalded, and strained. You may scoop the 
rind and fill the oranges, and, when cold, halve or quarter them. 

Restorative Jelly, 

Take two pounds of knuckle- of veal and a pound and a half 
of lean beef; set it over the fire with four pints of water; cover 
it close, and stew it till reduced to half. While stewing, put in 
half an ounce of fine isinglass, picked small, a little salt, and 
mace. Strain it off clear, and when cold take off every particle 
of fat. Warm it in hot water, and not in a pan. Take a tea* 
cupful twice a day. 

Strawberry Jelly, 

Boil two ounces of isinglass in a quarter of a pint of water 
over a gentle fire, and skim it well. Mash a quart of scarlet 
strawberries in an earthen pan with a wooden spoon ; then put 
in the isinglass, some powdered sugar, and the juice of a good 
lemon — this quantity is for six small moulds ; if you do not find 
it enough, add a little more water; then run it through a 
tamis, changing it two or three times. 

Wine Jelly, 
On two ounces of isinglass and one oiince of hartshorn 
shavings pour one pint of boiling water; let it stand a quarter 
of an hour covered close; then add two quarts of water, and 



282 CONFECTIONARY. 

boil it well till the isinglass is dissolved \ add a pint of dry 
wine, sugar to your taste, four lemons, and the whites of sev^i 
eggs weH beaten. Boil it quick, and keep it stirring all the 
time ; then pour it through a jeHy-bag, and strain it two or 
three times till quite clear. 

Lemons or Seville Oranges, to preserve. 
Take fine large lemons or Seville oranges ; rasp the outside 
skin very fine and thin ; put them in cold water, and let them 
lie all night. Put them in fresh water, and set them on the fire 
in plenty of water, and, when they have had two or three boils, 
take them off, and let them lie all night in cold water. Then 
put them into fresh water, and let tiiem boil till they are so 
tender that you can run a straw through them. ' If you* think 
the bitterness not sufficiently out, put them again into cold 
water, and let them lie all night. Lemons need not soak so 
long as oranges. To four oranges or lemons put two pounds 
' of the best sugar and a pint of water ; boil and skim it clear, 
and when it is cold put in the oranges, and let them lie four or 
five days in cold syrup ; then give them a boil every day till 
they look clear. Make some pippin or codlin jelly thus: to a 
pint of either put one pound of sugar, and let it boil till it 
jellies ; then heat the oranges, and put them to the jelly and 
half their syrup ; boil them very fast a quarter of an hour, and, 
just before you take them off the fire, put in the juice of two or 
three lemons ; put them in pots or porringers, that will hold 
them single, and that will admit jeDy enough. To four oranges 
or lemons, put a pound and a half of jelly and the same quan- 
tity of syrup, but boiled together, as directed for the oranges. 
Malaga lemons are the best ; they are done in the same manner 
as the oranges, only that they do not require so much soaking. 

Lemon Caudle. 

Take a pint of water, the juice of two lemons, the rind of 
half a lemon pared as thin as possible from the white, a blade 
of mace, and some bread shred very small ; sweeten to your 
taste. Set the whole on the fire to boil ; when boiled enough, 
which you will perceive by the bread being soft, beat three or 
four eggs well together till they are as thin as water; then take 
a little out of the skiDet and put to the eggs, and so proceed 
till the eggs are hot; then put them to the rest, stirring well 
to prevent curdling. 

Lemon or Chocolate Drops. 

Take half a pound of fine-sifted double-refined sugar ; grate 
into it the yellow rind of a fair large lemon; whip the white 



CONFECTIONARY. 283 

of an egg to a froth, with which wet the sugar till it is as stiff 
as good working paste. Drop it as you like on paper, with a 
little sugar first sifted on it ; bake in a very slow oven. 

For chocolate drops, grate about an ounce of chocolate as you 
did of lemon-peel, whidi must then be left out. 

Lemon Puffs. 
Into half a pound of double-refined sugar, beat fine and 
sifted, grate the yellow rind of a large lemon. Whip up the 
white of an egg to a froth, and wet it with the frotik, tiU it 
is as stiff as a good working paste. Lay the pufis on papers, 
and bake them in a very slow oven. 

Lemon Tart, 
A quarter of a pound of almonds blanched and beaten with 
a little sweet cream ; put in half a pound of sugar, the yolks 
only of eight eggs, half a pound of butter, the peel of two 
lemons grated. Beat all together fine in a mortar ; lay puff 
paste about the dish ; bake it half an hour. 

Lemon Solid. 
Put the juice of a lemon, with the rind grated, into a dish : 
sweeten it to your taste ; boU a quart of cream till it is reduced 
to three half pints ; pour it upon the lemon, and let it stand to 
cool. It should be made the day before it is used. 

Syrup of Lemons. 
To. three pounds of the best sugar finely beaten put one pint 
of lemon juice, set by to settle, and then poured off clear : put 
it in a silver tankard, and set that in a pot of boiling water. 
Let this boil till the sugar is quite dissolved, and when cold 
bottle it ; take care that in the boiling not the least water gets 
in. Skim off any little scum that rises. 

Macaroons. 
Take half a pound of almonds, blanched and pounded, and 
half a pound of finely pounded lump sugar. Beat up the 
whites of two eggs to a froth ; mix the sugar and almonds to- 
gether ; add the eggs by degrees ; and, when they are well 
mixed, drop a spoonfril on wafer-paper. They must be baked 
as soon as made in a slow oven. 

Citron Marmalade. 
Boil the citron very tender, cutting off all the yellow rind ; 
beat the white very well in a wooden bowl ; shred the rind. 



284 CONPECTIONAHY* 

and to a pound of pulp and rind take a pound and a half of 
sugar, and half a pint of water. When it boils, put in the 
citron, and boil it very fast till it is clear ; put in half a pint 
of pippin jelly, and bo& it till it jellies very well ; then add the 
lemon-juice, and put it into yoiir pots or glasses. 

Cherry Marmalade, 

Take eight pounds of cherries, not too ripe ; stone them ; 
take two pounds of sugar beaten, and the juice of four quarts 
of currants, red and white. Put the cherries into a pan, with 
half a pound of the sugar, over a very hot fire ; shake them fre- 
quently ; when there is a good deal of liquor, put in the rest of 
the sugar, skimming it well and boiling it as fast as possible, 
till your syrup is almost wasted ; then put in your currant juice, 
and let it boil quick till it jellies ; keep stirring it with care ; 
then put it in pots. 

Another way. 

Take five pounds of cherries stoned and two pounds of loaf 
sugar; shred your cherries, wet your sugar with the juice that 
runs from them, then put the cherries into the sugar, and boil 
them prett)' fast, till they become a marmalade. When cold, 
put it into glasses for use. 

Orange Marmalade, No. 1. 

Pare your oranges very thin, and lay them in water two or 
three days, changing the water twice a day ; then take them 
out, and dry them with a linen cloth. Take their weight in 
Sugar beat fine ; cut the oranges in halves, take out the pulp, 
pick out the seeds, and take ofif the skins carefully. Boil the 
rinds very tender in a linen cloth; cut them in strips whilst hot, 
and lay them in the pan in which you design to boil the mar- 
malade. Put a layer of sugar, and a layer of orange rinds, 
alternately, till all are in ; let them stand till the sugar is quite 
dissolved ; add the juice of a lemon ; set them on a stove, and 
let them boil fast till nearly done; then put in the pulp, and 
boil them again till quite done. Take them ofif, and add the 
juice of a lemon ; let them stsuid in pots for a few days, and they 
will be fit for eating. 

Lemon marmalade may be done in the same way, only with 
a much greater quantity of sugar, or sugar mixed with sugar- 
candy. 

Orange Marmalade, No. 2. 

Take six dozen Seville oranges ; pare thin three dozen, the 
other three rasp thin, and keep the parings and raspings sepa- 
rate. Cut all the six dozen in halves; squeeze out the juice, 



CONFECTIONARY. 285 

but not too .hard; scoop out the pulp with a tea-spoon ; pick 
out the seeds, and keep the pulp. Boil the skins, changing 
the water two or three times, to take off the bitterness, till they 
are tender enough for a straw to pierce them. When they are 
boiled, scoop out and throw away the stringy part ; boil the 
parings three times in different waters; beat the boiled skins 
very fine in a marble mortar ; beat the boiled rinds in the same 
manner. The pulp, skin, rinds, and juice, must be all weighed, 
but not yet mixed ; for each pound in the whole take one 
pound of loaf sugar, which must first be mixed with a little 
water, boiled alone, well skimmed, and thoroughly cleared. 
The pulp, skins, and juice, must then be put into this syrup, 
well mixed, and boiled together for about half an hour ; after 
which put in the rasped rinds, beaten as above directed, and 
boil all together for a short time. Put the marmalade into small 
pot«, and cover with brandy paper. 

OrHnge Marmalade, No. 3. 
Take a dozen of Seville oranges and their weight in sugar 
finely powdered. Pare the oranges as thin -as possible ; the 
first peel is not used in marmalade ; -it is better to grate off the 
outer peel and put them in water. Let them lie two or three 
days, changing the water every day ; then cut the oranges in 
quarters, and take out all the pulp ; boil the peels in several 
waters, till they are quite tender and not bitter. Then put to 
the sugar half a pint of water, and boil it to a syrup, till it draws 
as fine as a hair; put ia the peels sliced very thin, and boil them 
gently about a quarter of an hour. While the peels are boihng, 
pick out all the seeds and skins from the pulp : then put the 
pulp to the orange-peel ; let it boil till it is clear ; put a little 
in a saucer, and when it jellies it is done enough. 

Scotch Orange Marmalade. 

Weigh the oranges, and take ftn equal weight of sugar; 
wipe the fruit with a wet cloth ; grate them, cut them across, 
and squeeze them through a hair sieve. Boil the skins tender, 
so that the head of a pin will easily pierce them ; take them 
off the fire, squeeze out the water, scrape the pulp from them, 
cut the skins into very thin chips, and let them boil until they 
are very transparent. Then put in the juice and so much of 
the gratings as you choose ; let it all boil together till it will 
jelly, which you will know by letting a little of it cool in 
a saucer. 

Red Quince Marmalade, No. 1 . 

Take one pound and a half of quinces, two pounds of sugar, 
a pint of water, and a quarter of a pint of the juice of quinces; 



286 CONFECTIONARY. 

boil it tender, and skim it well. *Wben done enough, put into 
it a quarter of a pint of the juice of barberries. Skim it 
dear as long as any thing rises. 

Red Quince Marmalade, No. 2. 
Scald as many fine large quinces as you would use, and grate 
as many small ones as will make a quart of juice, or according 
to the quantity you want. Let this settle; after you have 
pressed it through a coarse cloth, strain it through a jelly-bag, 
that what you use may be perfectly clear. To every pint of 
this liquor put a pound and a half of sugar, and a pound and a 
half of the scalded quinces, which must be pared and core4 
before they are weighed. Set it at first on a pretty brisk fire ; 
when it begins to boil, slacken the fire ; and when it begins to 
turn red cover it close. As soon as it is of a fine bright red, 
take it off, as it turns of a blackish muddy colour in a moment 
if not carefully watched. A small bit of cochineal, tied up in 
a bit of rag and boiled with it, gives it a beautiful colour. 
Before you have finished boiling, add barberry juice, to your 
judgment, which improves the flavour. 

Red Quince Marmalade* No. 3. 
Pare the quinces, quarter them, and cut out all the hard part; 
to a pound of quinces put a pound and a half of sugar and half 
a pound of the juice of barberries, boiled with water, as you do 
jeDy or other fruit, boiling it very fast, and break it very small; 
when it is all to pieces and jellied, it is enough. If you wish 
the marmalade to be of a green colour, put a few black bullaces 
to the barberries when you make the jelly. 

White Quince Marmalade. 

Pare and quarter the quinces, and put as much water as 
will cover them ; boil them all to pieces to make jelly, and 
run it through a jelly-bag. Take a pound of quinces, quarter 
them, and cut out all the hard parts ; pare them, and to a pound 
of fruit put a pound and a half of finely beaten sugar and half 
a pint of water. Let it boil till very clear ; keep stirring it, and 
it will break as you wish it. When the sugar is boiled very 
thick, almost to a candy, put in half a pint of jelly, and let it 
boil very fast till it becomes a jelly. Take it off the fire, and 
put in juice of lemon ; skim it well, and put it into pots or 
glasses. 

Marchpane, 

Blanch one pound of almonds as white as you can ; take 
three quarters of a pound of fine white sugar well pounded; 
beat them up together with a little rose-water, to prevent 



CONFECTIONARY. 287 

the almonds from oiling. Take out the mixture, work it like 
paste, make it into cakes, lay them on wafers, and bake them. 
Boil rose-water and sugar till it becomes a syrup ; when the 
cakes are almost done, spread this syrup all over them, and 
strew them witK comfits. 

Another way. 
Take a pound of almonds finely beaten, and a pound of fine 
sugar, sifted through a hair sieve ; mix these together ; then 
add the whites of four eggs, beaten up to a froth; mix the 
whole well together, and scald it over your fire, still keeping 
it well- stirred, to prevent burning. Let it stand till cold; 
afterwards roll it on papers, and bake it. 

Marrow Pasties. 
Make the pasties small, the length of a finger ; put in large 
pieces of marrow, first dipped in egg, and seasoned with sugar, 
beaten cloves, mace, and nutmeg. Strew a few currants on the 
marrow, and either bake or fry them. 

Melons or Cucumbers, to preserve* 
Cut and pare a thoroughly ripe melon into thick slices ; put 
them into water till they become mouldy ; then put them into 
firesh water over the fire to coddle, not to boil. Make a good 
syrup ; when properly skimmed, and while boiling, put your 
melon in to boil for a short time. The S3rrup should be boiled 
every day for a fortnight ; do not put it to the melon till a little 
cold : the last time you boil the S3rrup, put it into a muslin bag ; 
add one ounce of ginger pounded and the juice and rind of two 
lemons ; but, if a large melon, allow an additicmal ounce of 
ginger. 

Melon Compote, 
Cut a good melon as for eating ; peel it, carefully taldng off 
the green part entirely, but not more. Take out all the inside, 
and steep the slices for ten days in the best vinegar* keeping it 
well covered. Take out the slices, and put them over the 
fire in fresh vinegar ; let them stew till quite tender. Then 
drain and dry them in a cloth ; stick bits of cloves and cinna- 
mon in them ; lay them in a jar, and make a syrup, and pour 
over them. Tie the jar close down. This kind of sweetmeat 
is eaten in Geneva with roast meat, and is much better than 
currant jelly or apple sauce. The melon must be in good order, 
and within three or four days of being ripe enough to eat.

rennets, pared, cored, and chopped small : mix all well toge- 
ther, and let it stand two days, stirring it from the bottom twice 
or thrice a day. Add three whole dried preserved oranges and 
an equal weight of dried citron. Mix in the suet a day or two 
before you use it. Add lemon-juice to your taste, and that 
only to the quantity you mean to bake at once. Without suet 
these ingredients will keep for six months. 

Mince Meat without Meat. No. 2.

take four pounds of raisins of the sun, stoned and chopped very 
fine, five pounds of currants, three pounds of beef suet shred

cored, three pounds of currants washed, picked, and dried, one 
pound and a half of sugar powdered, three quarters of a pound

peels together with the pulp tiD it will pound in a mortar; 
put to it one pound of beef suet, finely chopped, cunrants 
and lump sugar, one pound of each ; mix it all well together ; 
then add the juice with a glass of brandy. Put sweetmeats to 
your taste. 

Mirangles, 

Put half a pint of syrup into a stewpan, and boil it to what 
is called blow ; then take the whites of three eggs, put them 
in another copper pan, and whisk them very strong. When 
your sugar is boiled, rub it against the sides of the stewpan 
with a table-spoon ; when you see the sugar change, quickly 
mix the whites of eggs with it, for if you are not quick your 
sugar will turn to powder. When you have mixed it as fight 
as possible, put in the rind of one lemon ; stir it as little as 
possible: take a board, about one foot wide and eighteen 
inches long, and put a sheet of paper on it. With your table- 
spoon drop your batter in the shape of half an egg : sift a 
little powdered sugar over them before you put them in the 
oven. Let your oven be of a moderate heat; watch them 
attentively, and let them rise, and just let the outside be a 
little hard, but not tlie least brown ; the inside must be moist. 
Take them off with a knife, and just put about a tea-spoonful 
of jam in the middle of them ; then put two of them together, 
and they will be in the shape of an egg ; you must hancQe 
them very gently. 

Moss, 

Take as much white starch as sugar, and sift it; colour 
some of the sugar with turmeric, some with blue powder, 
some with chocolate, and some with the jpice of spinach ; and 
wet each by itself with a solution of oum-dragon. Strain 



290 CONFECTIONARY. 

and rub it through a hair sieve> and let them dry before you 
touch them. 

Muffins, 

Mix flour in a pan, with warm new milk and water, yest and 
salt, according to your judgment. Beat it up well with a 
wooden spoon till it is a stiff batter; then set it near the fire 
to rise, which will be in about an hour. It must then be well 
beaten down, and put to rise again, and, when very light, 
made into muffins, and baked in flat round irons made for the 
purpose. The iron must be made hot, and kept so with coals 
under it. Take out the batter with a spoon, and drop it on a 
little flour sprinkled lightly on a table. Then lay them on a 
trencher witii a little flour ; turn the trencher round to shape 
them, assisting with your hand if they need it. Then bake 
them ;^when one side is done, turn them with a muffin knifie, 
and bake the other. 

Oranges, to preserve. 

Make a hole at the stalk end ; take out all the seeds, but no 
pulp ; squeeze out the juice, which must be saved to put to 
them, taking great care you do not loosen the pulp. Put them 
into an earthen pan, with water ; boil them till the water is 
bitter, changing it three times, and, in the last water put a 
little salt, and boil them till they are very tender, but not to 
break. Take them out and drain them ; take two pounds of 
sugar and a quart of pippin jelly ; boil it to a syrup, skim it 
very clear, and then put in your oranges. Set them over a 
gentle fire till they boil very tender and clear ; then put to 
them the juice that you took from them ; prick them with a 
knife that the syrup may penetrate. If you cut them in 
halves, lay the skin side upwards, and put them up and cover 
them with the syrup. 

Lemons and citrons may be done in the same way. 

Whole Oranges, to preserve. 
Take six oranges, rasp them very thin, put them in water 
as you do them, and let them lie all night. In the morning 
boil them till they are tender, and then put them into clear 
water, and let them remain so two or three days. Take the 
oranges, and cut a hole in the top, and pick out the seeds, 
but not the meat ; then take three pounds of fine sugar, and 
make a thin syrup, and, when boiled and skimmed, put in 
your oranges, and let them boil till they are clear. Take them 
out, and let them stand three or four days; then boil them 
again till the syrup is rather thick. Put half a pound of sugar 
and half a pint of apple jelly to every orange, and let it boil 



CONFECTIONARY. 291 

until it jellies ; put them into pots, and place any substance to 
keep down the orange in the pot till it cools. 

Seville Oranges, to preserve. 
Put Seville oranges in spring water, where let them re- 
main three or four days, shifting the water every day. Take 
them out, and grate off a litQe of the outside rind very 
carefully without touching the white, only to take away a little 
of the bitter ; make a thin syrup, and, when it is sufficiently 
cleared and boiled, take it off, and, when it is only warm, put 
the oranges in and just simmer them over the fire. Put them 
and the syrup into a pan, and in a day or two set them again 
on the fire, and just scald them. Repeat this a day afterwards ; 
then boil a thick syrup ; take the oranges out of the thin one, 
and lay them on a cloth to drain, covered over with another ; 
then put them to the thick syrup, as you before did to the thin 
one, putting them into it just hot, and giving them a simmer. 
Repeat this in a few days if you think they are not sufficiently 
done. The insides must be left in. 

Butter Orange. 
Take a pint of the juice of oranges and eight new-laid eggs 
beaten well together ; mix and season them to your taste wifii 
loaf-sugar; then set it on the fire ; keep stirring till it becomes 
thick ; put in a bit of butter of the size of a walnut, stirring it 
while on the fire ; then dish it up. 

Candied Orange. 
Take twelve oranges, the palest you can get ; take out the 
pulp, pick out the seeds and skins ; let the outsides soak in 
water with a little salt all night: tiien boil them in a good 
quantity of spring water, till tender, which will be about nine 
or ten hours. Drain and cut them in very thin slices ; add 
them to the pulp, and to every pound take one pound and a half 
of sugar beaten fine. Boil them together till clear, which will 
be in about three quarters of an hour. 

Orange Cream. 
Grate the peels of four Seville oranges into a pint of water, 
then squeeze the juice into the water. Well beat Hie yolks of 
four eggs ; put all together ; and sweeten with double-refined 
sugar. Press the whole hard through a strong strainer; set if^ 
on the fire, and stir it carefully one way, till it is as thick as 
cream.

292 CONFECTIONARY, 

Orange Jelly, 

Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in a pint of water ; add a 
pint of the juice of four China oranges, two Seville oranges, 
and two lemons. Grate the peel of them all, and sweeten to 
your palate. '^ 

Orange Paste, 

Pick all the meat out of the oranges, and boil the rinds in 
water till they are very tender. Cut off all the outside, and 
beat the pulp in a mortar till it is very fine. Shred the out- 
side in long thin bits, and mix it with the meat, when you have 
taken out dl the seeds. To every pint of juice put half a pint 
of the pulp, and mix all together. Then boil up a candy of 
sugar ; put in your paste, and just scald it ; add a g^od pound 
of sugar to a pint of the paste; put it into a broad earthen pan, 
set it on a stove, let it remain till it candies ; skim it off with 
a spoon, drop it on glasses to dry, and as , often as it candies 
keep skimming it. 

Another way. 

To six ounces of sugar put six ounces at least of fine flour, 
mixed with a little orange-flower water, but no e^s, as they 
would make it too dry. Moisten with water, taking care that 
it is neither too hard nor too soft. Rub the pan with a little 
fine oil. 

Orange Puffs, 

Pare off the yellow peel of a Is^ge Seville orange, but be 
careful not to touch the white ; boil it in three several waters to 
take out the bitterness ; it will require about three hours* boil- 
ing. Beat it very fine in a marble mortar, with four ounces of 
fine lump sugar, four ounces of fresh butter, the yolks of six 
eggs, four good spoonfuls of sweet thick cream, and one spoon-> 
ful of orange-flower water. Beat all these ingredients so 
well together that you cannot discern a particle of the orange- 
peel. Roll out your puff paste as thin as possible, lay it in 
pattypans, fill them with the ingredients, but do not cover them. 
Bake them in an ov^n no hotter than for cheesecakes ; but for 
ftying you must make them with crust without butter, and fry 
them in lard. 

Another way. 

Take cm pound of single-refined sugar sifted and the rind 
of an ora4p grated, a littie gum-dragon, and beaten almonds 
rubbed through a sieve. Mix all these well together ; wet it 
into paste, and beat it in a mortcw; add whites of eggs whipped 
to a frost. 



CONFECTIONARY. 298 

Orange Sponge, 
Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in one pint of water; strain 
it through a sieve ; add the juice of two China oranges and 
some lemon ; sugar it to your taste. Whisk it tiU it looks like 
a sponge ; put it into a mould, and turn it out. 

Orange and Lemon Syrup. 

To each pint of juice, which must he put into a large pan, 
throw a pound and a half of sugar, broken into small lumps, 
which must be stirred every day till dissolved, first carefully 
taking off the scum. Let the peel of about six oranges be put 
into twelve quarts, but it must be taken out when the sugar is 
melted, and you are ready to bottle it. Proceed in the same 
way with lemon, only taking two pounds of sugar to a pint of 
juice. 

Oranges for a Tart, 

Pare some oranges as thin as possible ; boil them till they 
are soft. Cut and core double the number of good pippins, and 
boil them to paj), but so as that. they do not lose their colour ; 
strain the pulp, and add one pound of sugar to every pint. 
Take out the orange-pulp, cut the peel, make it very soft by 
boiling, and bruise it in a mortar in the juice of lemons and 
oranges ; then boil it to a proper consistence with the apple 
and orange-pulp and half a pint of rose-water. 

Orange Tart, 

Take eight Seville oranges ; cut them in halves, pick out all 
the seeds ; then pick out all the orange as free from the white 
skins as possible. Take the seeds out of the cores, and boil 
them till tender and free from bitter. When done enough, 
dry them very well from the water, and beat ^\e of the 
orange-peels in a marble mortar till quite smooth. Then take 
the weight of the oranges in double-refined sugar, beaten fine, 
and sifted; mix it with the juice, and pound all well in the 
mortar ; the peel that was left unbeaten you slice into your 
tart. You may keep out as much sugar as will ice the tart. 
Make the crust for it with twelve ounces of flour, six ounces 
of butter, melted in water, and the yolks of two eggs, well 
beaten and mixed into your flour. Be sure to i|j^k the crust 
well before it goes into the oven. ^P 

Half this quantity makes a pretty-sized tart. 

Another way. 
Take as many oranges as you require. Cut the peel 
extremely thin from the white, and shr^ it small. Clear the 



294 CONFECTIONARY. 

oranges entirely from the white, and cut them in small pieces 
like an apple, taking out the seeds. Sweeten as required, and 
bake in a nice paste. In winter, apples may be mixed. 

Panada. 
Take oatmeal, clean picked and well beaten; steep it in 
water all night ; strain and boil it in a pipkin, with some cur- 
rants, a blade or two of mace, and a Httle salt. When it is 
well boiled, take it off; and put in the yolks of two or three 
new-laid eggs, beaten with rose-water. Set it on a gentle fire, 
and stir it that it may not curdle. Sweeten with sugar, and 
put in a little nutmeg. 

Pancakes. No. 1. 

Mix a quart of milk with as much flour as will make it into 
a thin batter ; break in six eggs ; put in a little salt, a glass of 
raisin wine, a spoonful of beaten ginger ; mix all well toge- 
ther ; fry and sprinkle them with sugar. 

In making pancakes or fritters, always make your batter an 
hour before you begin frying, that the flour may have time to 
mix thoroughly. Never fry them till they are wanted, or they 
will eat flat and insipid. Add a little lemon-juice or peel. 

Pancakes. No. 2. 
To a pint of cream put three spoonfuls of sack, half a pint 
of flour, six eggs, but only three whites ; grate in some nut- 
meg, very litfle salt, a quarter of a pound of butter melted, 
and some sugar. After the first pancake, lay them on a dry 
pan, very thin, one upon another, till they are finished, before 
the fire ; then lay a dish on the top, and turn them over, so that 
the brown side is uppermost. You may add or diminish the 
quantity in proportion. This is a pretty supper dish. 

Pancakes. No. 3. 
Break three eggs, put four ounces and a half of flour, and a 
little milk, beat it into a smooth batter ; then add by degrees as 
much milk as will make it the thickness of good cream. Make 
the frying-pan hot, and to each pancake put a bit of butter 
nearly the size of a walnut ; when melted, pour in the batter 
to cover t]^flk)tt6m of the pan ; make them of the thickness 
of half a crown. The above will do for apple fritters, by 
adding one spoonfrd more flour ; peel and cut your apples in 
thick slices, take out the core, dip them in the batter, and fry 
them in hot lard ; put them in a sieve to drain ; grate some 
loaf sugar over them. 



-CONFECTIONARY. 295 

French Pancakes. 
Beat the yolks of eight eggs, which sweeten to your taste, 
nearly a table- spoonful of flour, a little brandy, and half a pint 
of cream. They are not to be turned in the frying-pan. 
When half done, take the whites beaten to a strong frot£, and 
put them over the pancakes. When these are done enough, 
roll them over, sugar them, and brown them with a salamander. 

Gr%llon*8 Pancakes. 
Two soup-ladles of flour, three yolks of eggs, and four 
whole ones, two tea-spoonfuls of orange-flower water, six rata- 
fia cakes, a pint of double cream ; to be stirred together, and 
sugar to be shaken over every pancake, which is not to be 
turned — about thirty in number. 

Qaire of Paper Pancakes. 

Take to a pint of cream eight eggs, leaving out two whites, 
three spoonfuls of fine flour, three of sack, one of orange- 
flower water, a little sugar, a grated nutmeg, a quarter of a 
pound of butter melted in the cream. Mix a little of the cream 
with flour, and so proceed by degrees that it may be smooth : 
then beat all well together. Butter the pan for the first pan- 
cake, and let them run as thin as possible to be whole. When 
one side is coloured, it is enough; take them carefully out of 
the pan, lay them as even on each other as possible; and keep 
them near the fire till they are all fried. The quantity here 
given makes twenty. 

Rice Pancakes. 

In a quart of milk mix by degrees three spoonfuls of flour of 
rice, and boil it till it is as thick as pap. As it boils, stir in 
half a pound of good butter and a nutmeg grated. Pour it 
into a pan, and, when cold, put in by degrees three or four 
spoonfuls of flour, a little salt, some sugar, and nine eggs, well 
beaten up. Mix them all together, and fry them in a small 
pan, with a little piece of butter. 

Paste. 

Take half a pound of good fresh butter, and work it to a 
cream in a basin. Stir into it a quarter of a pound of fine 
sifted sugar, and beat it together : then work ^i^i^it as much 
fine flour as will make a paste fit to roll out for^Rts, cheese- 
cakes, &c. 

Paste for baking or frying. 

Take a proper quantity of flour for the paste you wish to 
make, and mix it with equal quantities of powdered sugar and 
flour ; melt some butter very smooth, with some grated lemon- 



296 CONFECTIONARY. 

peel and an egg, well beat ; mix into a firm paste ; bake 
or fry it. 

Paste for Pies, 

fVenoh roll dough, rolled out with less than half the quan- 
tity of butter generally used, makes a wholesome and excdlent 
paste for pies. 

Paste for raised Pies. 

Put four pounds of butter into a kettle of water ; add three 
quarters of a pound of rendered beef suet ; boil it two or three 
minutes ; pour it on twelve pounds of flom-, and work it into a 
good stiff paste. Pull it into lumps to cool. Raise the pie, 
using the same proportions for aU raised pies according to the 
size required : bake in a hot oven. 

Another way. 

Take one pound of flour, and seven ounces of butter, put into 
boiling water till it dissolves : wet the flour lightly with it. 
Roll your paste out thick and not too stiff; line your tins with 
it ; put in the meat, and cover over the top of the tin with the 
same paste. 

This paste is best made over-night. 

Paste for Tarts. 
To half a pound of the best flour add the same quantity of 
butter, two spoonfuls of white sugar, the yolks of two eggs 
and one white ; make it into a paste with cold water. 

Paste for Tarts in pans. 
Take a pound of flour, the same of butter, with five yolks of 
eggs, the white of one, and as much water as will wet it into 
a pretty soft paste. Roll it up, and put it into your pan. 

Paste for very small Tartlets, 
Take an egg or moie, and mix it with some flour ; make a 
little ball as big as a tea-cup ; work it with your hands till it 
is quite hard and stiff; then break off a little at a time as you 
want it, keeping the rest of the ball under cover of a basin, for 
fear of its hardening or drying too much. Roll it out extremely 
thin ; cut it out, and make it up in what shape you please, 
and hardei^^m by the fire, or in an oven in a manner cold. 
It does for aimonds or cocoa-nut boiled up in syrup rich, or 
any thing that is a dry mixture, or does not want baking. 

Potato Paste. 
Take two thirds of potato and one of ground rice, as much 
butter rubbed in as wiU^ moisten it sufficiently to roll, which 



CONFECTIONARY. 297 

must be done with a little flour. The crust is best made thin 
and in small tarts. The potatoes should be well boiled and 
quite cold. 

Rice Paste. 
Whole rice, boiled in new milk, with a reasonable quantity 
of butter, to such a consistency as to roll out when cold. The 
board must be floured while rolling. 

Another way. 
Beat up a quarter of a pound of rice-flour with two eggs ; 
boil it till soft ; then make it into a paste with very little butter, 
and bake it. 

Paste Royal. 
Mix together one pound of flour, and two ounces of sifted 
sugar ; rub into it half a pound of good butter, and make it 
into a paste not over stifle Roll it out for your pans. This 
paste is proper for any sweet tart or cheesecake. 

Short or Puf Paste. No. I. 

Rub together six ounces of butter and eight of flour ; mix 
it up with as little water as possible, so as to make a stiff paste. 
Beat it well, and roll it thin. This is the best crust of all for 
tarts that are to be eaten cold and for preserved fruit. Have 
a moderate oven. 

Short Paste. No. 2. 

Half a pound of loaf-sugar, and the same quantity of butter, 
to be rubbed into a pound of flour ; then make it into paste 
with two eggs. 

Short Paste. No. 3. 

To a pound and a quarter of sifted flour rub gently in half 
a pound of fresh butter, mixed up with half a pint of spring 
water, and set it by for a quarter of an hour ; then roll it out 
thin ; lay on it in small pieces three quarters of a pound more 
of butter ; throw on it a little more flour, roll it out thin three 
times, and set it by for an hour in a cold place. 

Short Paste. No. 4. 
Take one pound of flour, half a pound of fresh butter, and 
about four table-spoonfuls of pounded white su|^. Knead 
the paste with the yolks of two eggs well beatei4l^ instead of 
water. Roll it very thin for biscuits or tarts. 

Short Paste. No. 5. 
Three ounces of butter to something less than a pound of 
flour and the yolk of one egg ; the butter to be thoroughly 

o5 



298 CONFECTIONARY. 

worked into the flour ; if you use sugar, there is no occasion 
for an egg. 

SKort Paste. No. 6. 
Three quarters of a pound of butter, and the same of flour ; 
mix the flour very stifl* with a little water ; put the butter in a 
clean cloth, and press it thoroughly to get from it all the water. 
Then roll out all the flour and water paste, and lay the butter 
upon it, double over the paste, and beat it with a rolling-pin. 
Double it up quite thick, lay it in a clean plate, and put it in 
a cool place for an hour. If it is not light when tried in the 
oven, it must be beaten again. 

Short Paste. No. 7. 
Rub into your flour as much butter as possible, without its 
being greasy ; rub it in very fine ; put water to make it into a 
nice light paste ; roll it out ; stick bits of butter all over it ; 
then flour and roll it up again. Do this three times ; it is ex- 
cellent for meat -pies. 

Short Paste, made with Suet. 
To one pound of flour take about half a pound of beef suet 
chopped very small ; pour boiling water upon it ; let it stand 
a little time ; then mix the suet with the flour, taking as little 
of the water as possible, and roll it very thin ; put a little sugar 
and white of egg over the crust before it is baked. 

Sugar Paste. 
Take half a pound of flour, and the same quantity of sugar 
well pounded ; work it together, with a little cream and about 
two ounces of butter, into a stiff paste ; roll it very thin. 
When the tarts are made, rub the white of an egg, well beaten, 
over them with a feather ; put them in a moderate oven, and 
sift sugar over them. 

Peaches, to preserve in Brandt/. No. 1 . 
The peaches should be gathered before they are too ripe ; 
they should be of the hard kind — old Newington or the Mag- 
dalen peaches are the best. Rub off the down with a flannel, 
and loosen the stone, which is done by cutting a quill and pas- 
sing it carefully round the stone. Prick them with a large needle 
in several places ; put them into cold water ; give them a great 
deal of room in the preserving-pan; scald them extremely 
gently: the longer you are scalding them the better, for if you 
do them hastily, or with too quick a fire, they may crack or 
break. Turn them now aiid then with a feather : when they 



CONFECTIONARY. 299 

are tender to the feel, like a hard-boiled egg that has the shell 
taken off, remove them from the fire, carefdly take them out, 
and cover them up close with aflannel. You must in all their pro- 
gress observe to keep tiie fruit covered, and, whenever you take 
it from the scalding syrup, cover it up witli a cloth or flannel, 
or the air will change the colour. Then put to them a thin 
syrup cool. The next day, if you think the syrup too thin, drain 
it well from the peaches, and add a little more sugar ; boil it up, 
and put it to them almost cold. To a pint of sjrrup put half a 
pint of the best pale brandy you can get, which sweeten with 
fine sugar. If the brandy is dark-coloured, it will spoil the look 
of the fruit. Tlie peaches should be well chosen, and they 
should have sufficient room in the glass jars. When the liquor 
wastes,* supply the deficiency by adding more S3mip and brandy. 
Cover them with a bladder, and every now and then turn them 
upside down, till the fruit is settled. 

Peaches, to preserve in Brandy, No. 2. 

Scald some of the finest peaches of the white heart kind, free 
from spots, in a stewpan of water ; take them out when soft, 
and put them into a large table-cloth, four or five times doubled. 
Into a quart of white French brandy put ten oimces of pow- 
dered sugar ; let it dissolve, and stir it well. Put your peaches 
into a glass jar ; pour the brandy on them ; cover them very 
close with leather and bladder, and take care to keep your jar 
filled with brandy. 

You should mix your brandy and sugar before you scald the 
peaches. 

Peaches, to preserve in Brandy. No. 3. 

Put Newington peaches in boiling water : just give them 
a scald, but do not let them boil ; then take them out, and throw 
them into cold water. Dry them on a sieve, and put them in 
long wide-mouthed bottles. To half a dozen peaches take half 
a pound of sugar ; just wet it, and make it a thick syrup. Poitr 
it over the peaches hot ; when cold, fill the bottles with the 
finest pale brandy, and stop them very close. 

Pears, to pot. 
Put in your fruit scored ; cover them with apple jelly, and 
let them boil till they break ; then put them in ft ludr sieve, 
and rub them through with a spoon till you think it thick 
enough. Boil up as many pounds of sugar to a candy as you 
have pints of paste, and when the sugar is put in the paste, just 
scald it, and put it into pots. 



300 CONFECTIONARY. 

Pears, to stew. 
Pare some Barland pears t take out the core, and lay them 
close m a tm saucepan, with a cover fitting quite exact ; add 
the rind of a lemon cut thin and half its juice, a small stick of 
cinnamon, twenty grains of allspice, and one pound of loaf- 
sugar, to a pint and a half of water. Bake them six hours in 
a very slow oven. Prepared cochineal is often used for colouring. 

Chicken Pie, 
Parboil and neatly cut up your chickens ; dry them, and set 
them over a slow fire for a few minutes; have ready some force- 
meat, and with it some pieces of ham ; lay these at the bottom 
of the dish, and place the chickens upon it ; add some gravy 
well seasoned. It takes from an hour and a half to two hours. 

Giblet Pie, 

Let the giblets be well cleaned, and put all into a saucepan 
excepting the liver, with a little water and an onion, some 
' whole pepper, a bunch of sweet-herbs, and a little salt. Cover 
them close, and let them stew till tender ; then lay in your dish 
a puff paste, and upon that a rump-steak peppered and salted ; 
put the seasoned giblets in with the liver, and add the 
liquor they were stewed in. Close the pie ; bake it two hours ; 
and when done pour in the gravy. 

A Dutch pie is made in the same way. 

Common Goose Pie, 
Quarter a goose and season it well. Make a raised crust, and 
lay it in, with half a pound of butter at the top, cut into three 
pieces. Put the lid on, and bake it gently. 

Rich Goose Pie, 
After having boned your goose and fowl, season them weU, 
and put your fowl into the goose, and into the fowl some force- 
meat. Then put both into a raised crust, filling the comers 
with the forcemeat. Cut about half a pound of butter into 
three or four pieces, and lay on the top, and bake it well. 

Ham and Chicken Pie. 
Cut some thin slices from a boiled ham, lay them on a good 
puff paste at the bottom of your dish, and pepper them. Cut 
a fowl into four quarters, and season it with a great deal of 
pepper, and but a little salt; and lay on the top some hard 
yolks of eggs, a few truffles and morels, and then cover the 
whole with slices of ham peppered: fill the dish with gravy, and 



CON PECTIONARY. 301 

cover it with a good thick paste. Bake it well, and, when done, 
pour into it some rich gravy. If to be eaten cold, put no gravy. 

Hare Pie. 
Cut the hare into pieces ; season it with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and jug it with half a pound of butter. It must do 
above an hour, covered close in a pot of boiling water. Make 
some forcemeat, and add bruised liver and a glass of red wine. 
Let it be highly seasoned, and lay it round the inside of a 
raised crust ; put the hare in when cool, and add the gravy that 
came from it, with some more lich gravy. Put the lid on, and 
bake it two hours. 

Lumber Pie, 
Take the best neat's tongue well boiled, three quarters of a 
pound of beef suet, the like quantity of currants, two good 
handfuls of spinach, thyme, and parsley, a little nutmeg, and 
mace ; sweeten to your taste. Add a French roll grated and 
six eggs. Mix these all together, put them into your pie, then 
lay up the top. Cut into long slices one candied orange, two 
pieces of citron, some sliced lemon, add a good deal of marrow, 
^ preserved cherries and barberries, an apple or two cut into eight 
pieces, and some butter. Put in white wine, lemon, and sugar, 
and serve up. 

Olive Pie. 
Two pounds of leg of veal, the lean, with the skin taken out, 
one pound of beef suet, both shred very small and beaten; 
then put them together; add half a pound of currants and half 
a pound of raisins stoned, half a pound of sugar, eight eggs 
and the whites of four, thyme, sweet marjoram, winter savory, 
and parsley, a handful of each. Mix aU these together, and 
make it up in balls. When you put them in the pie, put but- 
ter between the top and bottom. Take as much suet as meat; 
when it is baked, put in a little white wine. 

Partridge Pie. 
Truss the partridges the same way as you do a fowl for boil- 
ing ; then beat in a mortar some shalots, parsley cut small, the 
livers of the birds, and double the quantity of bacon, seasoning 
them with pepper, salt, and two blades of mace. When well 
pounded, put in some fresh mushrooms. Raise a crust for the 
pie; cover the bottom with the seasoning; put in the partridges, 
but no stuffing » and put in the remainder of the seasoning 
between the birds and on the sides ; strew over a little mace, 
pepper and salt, shalots, fresh mushrooms, a little bacon beaten 
very fine ; lay a layer of it over them, and put the lid on. Two 



S02 CONFECTIONARY. 

hours and a half will bake it, and, when done, take the lid oft 
skim off the fat, put a pint of veal gravy, and squeeze in the 
juice of an orange. 

Rich Pigeon Pie. 

Season the pigeons high ; lay a pu£f paste at the bottom of 
the dish, stuffing the craws of the birds with forcemeat, and lay 
them in the dish with the breasts downward ; fill all the spaces 
with forcemeat, hard-boiledyolks of eggs, artichoke bottoms cut 
in pieces, and asparagus tops. Cover, and bake it; when 
drawn, pour in ridi gravy. 

High Veal Pie. 

Veal, forcemeat balls, yolks of eggs, oysters, a little nutmeg, 
cayenne pepper, and salt, with a little water put into the dish. 

Vegetable Pie. 
Stew three pounds of gravy beef, with some white pepper, 
salt, and mace, a bundle of sweet-herbs, a few sweet almonds, 
onions, and carrots, till the gravy is of a good brown colour. 
Strain it off; let it stand till cold ; and take off all the fat. Have 
some carrots, turnips, onions, potatoes, and celery, ready cut; 
boil all these together. Boil some greens by themselves, and add 
them to the pie when served up. 

A Yorkshire Christmas Pie. 

Let the crust be made a good standing oue ; the wall and 
bottom must be very thick. Take a turkey and bone it, a 
goose, a fowl, a partridge, and a pigeon, and season all well. 
Take half an ounce of cloves, the same of black pepper, and two 
table-spoonfuls of salt, and beat them well together ; let the 
fowls be slit down the back, and bone them ; put the pigeon 
into the partridge, the partridge into the fowl, the fowl into 
the goose, and die goose into the turkey. Season all well first, 
and lay them in the crust ; joint a hare, and cut it into pieces ; 
season it, and lay it close on one side ; on the other side wood- 
cocks, or any other sort of game ; let them also be well sea- 
soned and laid close. Put four or five pounds of butter into 
the pie ; cover it with a very rich paste, put it in a very hot 
oven, and four hours will bake it. 

A bushel of flour is about the quantity required for the paste. 

Pineapple, to preserve in slices. 

Pare the pines, and cut them in slices of about the same 

thickness as you would apples for fritters. Take the weight of 

the fruit in the best sugar ; sift it very fine, and put a layer 

of sugar, then a layer of pineapple; let it stand till the 



CONFECTIONARY. 803 

sugar is entirely dissolved. Then drain off the syrup, and lay 
the pine in the pot in which you intend to keep it ; boil the 
syrup, adding a little more sugar and water to make it rich ; 
pour it, but not too hot, upon the fruit. Repeat this in about 
ten days ; look at it now and then, and, if the syrup ferments, 
boil it up again, skim it, and pour it warm upon the pine. The 
parings of the pineapple boil in the water you use for the 
syrup, and extract all the flavour from them. 

Pineapple Chips. 
Pare the pineapples ; pick out the thistle part : take half its 
weight of treble-refined sugar ; part the apple in halves ; slice 
it thin ; put it in a basin, with sifted sugar between ; in twelve 
hours Uie sugar will be melted. Set it over a fire, and simmer ' 
the chips till clear. The less they boil the better. Next day, 
heat them ; scrape off the syrup ; lay them in glasses, and dry 
them on a moderate stove or oven. 

Plums, to dry green. 

Take green amber plums ; prick them with a pin all over ; 
make some water boihng hot, and put in the plums ; be sure to 
have so much water as not to be made cold when the plums 
are put in. Cover them very close, and, when they are almost 
cold, set them on the fire again, but do not let them boil. Do 
so three or four times. When you see the thin skin cracked, 
put in some alum finely beaten, and keep them in a scald till 
they begin to green ; then give them a boil closely covered. 
When they are green, let ti^em stand in fresh hot water all 
night ; next day, have ready as much clarified sugar, made into 
syrup, as will cover them ; drain the plums, put them into the 
syrup, and give them two or three boils. Repeat this twice 
or three times, till they are very green. Let them stand in 
the syrup a week ; then lay them out to dry in a hot stove. 
You may put some of them in codling jelly, and use them as 
a wet sweetmeat. 

Green Plum Jam. 

Take the great white plums before they begin to turn, when 
they are at their full growth, and to every pound of plums 
allow three quarters of a pound of fine sugar. Pare and throw 
the plums into water, to keep their colour ; let your sugar be 
very finely pounded ; cut your plums into slices, and strew the 
sugar over them. You must first take them out of the water, 
and put them over a moderate fire, and boil them till they are 
clear and will jeUy. You may put in a few of the stones, if 
vou like them. 



804 CON FICTION ARY. 

Great White Plum, to preserve. 
To one pound of plums put three quarters of a pound of fine 
sugar; dip the lumps of sugar in water just sufficient to wet 
it through ; boil and skim it, till you think it enough. Slit the 
plums down the seam ; put them in the syrup with the slit 
downward, and let them stew over the fire for a quarter of an 
hour. Skim them ; take them off; when cold, turn them ; cover 
them up for four or five days, turning them two or three times 
a day in the syrup ; then put them in pots, not too many 
togetiiier. 

Posset. 
Take a quart of white wine and a quart of water ; boil whole 
spice in them ; then take twelve eggs, and put away half the 
whites ; beat them very well, and take the wine from the fire; 
then put your eggs, being thoroughly beaten, to the wine. 
Stir the whole together ; then set it on a very slow fire, stir- 
ring it the whole time, till it is thick. Sweeten it with sugar, 
and sprinkle on it beaten spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 

Another way, richer. 

Take two quarts of cream, and boil it with whole spice ; then 
take twelve eggs, well beaten and strained; take the cream from 
the fire, and stir in the eggs, and as much sugar as will 
sweeten it according to the taste of those who are to drink it ; 
then a pint of wine, or more — sack, sherry, or Lisbon. Set 
it on the fire again, and let it stand awhile ; then take a ladle, 
and raise it up gently from the bottom of the skillet you make 
it in, and break it as little as you can, and do so till you see 
that it is thick enough. Then put it into a basin with a ladle 
gently. If you do it too much or too quickly it will whey, 
and that is not good. 

Sack Posset. 

To twelve eggs, beaten very much, put a pint of sack, or 
any other strong rich white wine. Stir them well, that they 
may not curd ; put to them three pints of cream and half a 
pound of fine sugar, stirring them well together. When hot 
over the fire, put the posset into a basin, and set it over a 
boiling pot of water until it is like a custard ; then take it off, 
and, when it is cool enough to eat, serve it with beaten spice, 
cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg, strewed over it very thick. 

Sack Posset, without milk. 
Take thirteen eggs ; beat them very well, and, while they are 
beating, take a quart of sack, half a pound of fine sugar, and a 
pint of ale, and let them boil a very little while ; then put the

eggs to them, and stir them till they are hot. Take it from 
the fire, and keep it stirring awhile^ then put it into a fit 
hasin, and cover it close with a dish» Set it over the fire 
again till it rises to a cnrd ; serve it with heaten spice. 

Sack Posset, or Jelly, 
Take three pints of good cream and three quarters of a 
pound of fine sugar pounded, twenty eggs, leaving out eight 
of the whites; beat them very well and light. Add to them 
rather more than a pint of sack ; beat them again well ; then 
set it on a stove ; make it so hot that you can just endure your 
finger at the bottom of the pan, and not hotter ; stir it all one 
way ; put the cream on the fire just to boil up, and be ready 
at the time the sack is so. Boil in it a blade of mace, and put 
it boiling hot to the eggs and sack, which is to be only sodd- 
ing hot. When the cream is put in, just stir it round twice ; 
take it off the fire ; cover it up close when it is put into the 
mould or dish you intend it for, and it will jelly. Pour the 
cream to the eggs, holding it as high from them as possible. 

Puffs.

flower water, or rose-water; boil a pound of sugar to a candy;

cient : and the oven should be so quick as to brown both top

again. For sauce — ^melted butter, sack, and sugar. The above 
quantity will make fourteen puffs. 

Spanish Puffs. 

Take one pint of skim milk, and thicken it with flour ; boil

it all the time. Prepare your mould by putting into it sifted 
sugar sufficient to cover it ; melt it on the stove, and, when dis- 
solved, take care that the syrup covers the whole mould. The 
flavour is improved by grating into the sugar a little lemon- 
peel. Pour the pudding into your mould, and place it in a 
vessel of boiling water ; it must boil two hours ; it may then 
be turned out, and eaten hot or cold.

and put it into paper coffins. Twenty minutes will bake them. 

Ramaquins, No. 2. 

Take very nearly half a pound of Parmesan cheese, two 

ounces of mild Gloucester, four yolks of eggs, about six 

ounces of the best butter, and a good tea-cupful of cream. 

Beat the cheese first in a mortar ; add by degrees the other 



CONFECTIONARY. 327 

ingredients, and in some measure be regulated by your taste, 
"whether the proportion of any of them should be increased or 
diminished. A little while bakes them ; the oven must not be 
too hot. They are baked in little paper cases, and served as 
hot as possible. 

Ramaquins, No. 3. 

Put to a little water just warm a little salt ; stir in a quarter 
of a pound of butter ; it must not boil. When well mixed, let 
it stand till cold : then stir in three eggs, one at a time, beat- 
ing it well till it is quite smooth ; then add three more eggs, 
beating it well, and half a pound of Parmesan cheese. Beat it 
well again, adding two yolks of eggs and a quarter of a pound 
of cold butter, and again beat it. Just before it is going into 
the oven, beat six eggs to a froth, and beat the whole toge- 
ther. Bake in paper moulds and in a quick oven. Serve as 
hot as possible. 

Ramaquins, No. 4. 

Take a quarter of a pound of Cheshire cheese, two eggs, 
and two ounces of butter; beat them fine in a mortar, and 
make them up in cakes that will cover a piece of bread of the 
size of a crown-piece. Lay them on a dish, not touching one 
another ; set them on a chafing-dish of coals, and hold a sala- 
mander over them till they are quite brown. Serve up hot. 

Raspberries, to preserve. 
Take the juice of red and white raspberries ; if you have no 
white raspberries, put half codling jelly ; put a pint and a half 
of juice to_two pounds of sugar ; let it boil, and skim it. Then 
put in three quarters of a pound of large red raspberries ; boil 
them very fast till they jelly and are very clear ; do not take 
them off the fire, that would make them hard^ and a quarter 
of an hour will do them. After they begin to boil fast, put 
the raspberries in pots or glasses ; then strain the jelly from 
the seeds, and put it to them. When they begin to cool, 
stir them, that they may not lie at the top of the glasses ; 
and, when cold, lay upon them papers wetted with brandy 
and dried with a cloth. 

Another way. 
Put three quarters of a pound of moist sugar to every quart 
of fruit, and let them boil gently till they jelly. 

Raspberries, to preserve in Currant Jelly, 
Strip the currants from the stalks ; weigh one pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit, and to every eight pounds of 
currants put one pound of raspberries, for which you are not 



328 CONFECTIONARY. 

to allow any sugar. Wet the sngar, and let it boil till it is 
almost sugar again ; then throw in the fruity and, with a verv 
smart fire, let it boil up all over. Take it ofif, and strain it 
through a lawn sieve. You must not let it boil too much, for 
fear of the currants breaking, and the seeds coming through 
into the jelly. When it boils up in the middle, and the sjoup 
diffuses itself generally, it is sufficiently done ; then take it off 
instantly. This makes a very elegant, clear currant jelly, and 
may be kept and used as such. Take some whole fine large 
raspberries ; stalk them ; put some of the jelly, made as above 
directed, in your preserving-pan ; sprinkle in the raspberries, 
not too many at a time, for fear of bruising them. About ten 
minutes will do them. Take them off, and put them in pots 
or glasses. If you choose to do more, you must put in the 
pan a fresh supply of jelly. Let the jelly nearly boil up before 
you put in the raspberries. 

Raspberry Jam. No. 1. — Very good. 

Take to each pound of raspberries half a pint of juice of 
red and white currants, an equal quantity of each, in the whole 
half a pint, and a pound of double-refined sugar. Stew or 
bake the currants in a pot, to get out the juice. Let the sugar 
be finely beaten ; then take half the raspberries and squeeze 
through a coarse cloth, to keep back the seeds ; bruise the rest 
with the back of a wooden spoon ; the half that is bruised must 
be of the best raspberries. Mix the raspberries, juice, and 
sugar, together : set it over a good fire, and let it boil as fast 
as possible, till you see it will jelly, which you may try in a 
spoon. 

Raspberry Jam. No. 2. 

Weigh equal quantities of sugar and of fruit ; put the fruit 
into a preserving-pan : boil it very quickly ; break it ; and 
stir it constantly. When the juice is almost wasted, add the 
sugar, and simmer it half an hour. Use a silver spoon. 

Raspberry Jam, No. 3. 
To six quarts of raspberries put three pounds of refined 
sugar finely pounded ; strain half the raspberries from the 
seed ; then boil the juice and the other half together. As it 
jellies, put it into pots. The sugar should first be boiled sepa- 
rately, before the raspberries are added. 

Raspberry Paste. 
Break three parts of your raspberries red and white ; strain 
them through linen ; break the other part, and put into the 
juice ; boil it till it jellies, and then let it stand till cold. To 



CONFECTIONARY. 329 

every pint put a pound of sugar, and make it scalding hot : 
add some codling jelly before you put in the seeds. 

Apple Tart with Rice Crust, 
Pare and quarter six russet apples ; stew Ihem till soft ; 
sweeten with lump-sugar ; grate some lemon-peel ; boil a tea- 
cupful of rice in milk till it becomes thick : sweeten it well 
with loaf-sugar. Add a little cream, cinnamon, and nutmeg ; 
lay the apple in the dish ; cover it with rice ; beat the whites 
of two eggs to a strong froth ; lay it on the top ; dust a little 
sugar over it, and brown it in the oven. 

Another way. 
Pare and core as many apples as your dish will conveniently 
bake ; stew them with sugar, a bit of lemon-peel, and a little 
cinnamon. Prepare your rice as for a rice pudding. Fill your 
dish three parts full of apples, and cover it with the rice. 

R0IIS4 

Take two pounds of flour ; divide it ; put one half into a 
deep pan ; rub two ounces of butter into the flour ; the whites 
of two eggs whisked to a high froth; add one table-spoonful of 
yest, four table-spoonfuls of cream, the yolk of one egg, a 
pint of milk, rather more than new milk warm. Mix the 
above together into a lather ; beat it for ten minutes ; then 
cover it, and set it before the fire for two hours to rise. Mix 
in the other half of the flour, and set it before the fire for a 
quarter of an hour. These rolls must be baked in earthenware 
cups, rubbed with a little butter, and not more than half filled 
with dough ; they must be baked a quarter of an hour in a very 
hot oven. 

Another way. 

Take one quart of fine flour ; wet it with warm milk, and 
six table- spoonfuls of small beer yest, a quarter of a pound of 
butter, and a little salt. Do not make the dough too stiff at 
first, but let it rise awhile ; then work in the flour to the pro- 
per consistency. Set it to rise some time longer, then form 
your rolls of any size you please; bake them in a waimish 
oven ; twenty minutes will bake the small and half an hour the 
large ones. 

Excellent Rolls. 

Take three pounds of the finest flour, and mix up the yolks 
of three eggs with the yest. Wet the flour with milk, first 
melting in the milk one ounce of butter, and add a little salt 
to the flour. 



830 eONFEGTIONARY. 

Little Rolls. 
One pound of flour, two or three spoonfuls of yest, the yolks 
of two eggs, the white of one, a little salt, moistened with milk. 
This dough must be made softer than for bread, and beaten 
well with a spoon till it is quite light ; let it stand some hoars 
before it is baked; some persons make it over-night. The 
Dutch oven, which must first be made warm, will bake the 
rolls, which must be turned to prevent their catching. 

Breakfast Rolls, 
Rub exceedingly fine two ounces of good butter in a pound 
and three quarters of fine flour. Mix a table- spoonful of yest 
in half a pint of warm milk ; set a light sponge in the flour till 
it rises for an hour ; beat up one or two eggs in half a spoon- 
ful of fine sugar, and intermix it with the sponge, adding to it 
a little less than half a pint of warm milk with a tea-spoonful 
of salt. Mix all up to a light dough, and keep it warm, to rise 
again for another hour. Then break it in pieces, and roll them 
to the thickness of your finger of the proper length ; lay them 
on tin plates, and set them in a warm stove for an hour more. 
Then touch them, over with a httle milk, and bake them in a 
slow oven vrith care. To take off the bitterness from the yest, 
mix one pint of it in two gallons of water, and let it 8tan4 for 
twenty- four hours ; then throw off the water, and the yest is fit 
for use ; if not, repeat it. 

Another way. 
With two pounds of flour mix about half a pound of butter, 
till it is like crumbled bread; add two whole eggs, three 
spoonfuls of good yest, and a little salt. Make it up into little 
rolls ; set them before the fire for a short time to rise, but, if 
the yest is very good, this will not be necessary. 

Brentford Rolls. 
Take two pounds of fine flour ; put to it a little salt, and two 
spoonfuls of fine sugar sifted ; rub in a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, the yolks of two eggs, two spoonfuls of yest, and 
about a pint of milk. Work the whole into a dough, and set 
it to the fire to rise. Make twelve rolls of it ; lay them on 
buttered tins, let them stand to the fire to rise till they are very 
light, then bake them about half an hour. 

Dutch Rolls. 
Into one pound of flour rub three ounces of butter ; with a 
spoonful of yest, mixed up with warm milk, make it into light 



OONFECTIONARY. 351 

paste ; set it before the fire to rise. When risen nearly half 
as big again, make it into rolls about the length of four inches, 
and the breadth of two fingers ; set them again to rise before 
the fire, till risen very well ; put them into the oven for a 
quarter of an hour, 

French Rolls, No. 1 . 
Seven pounds of flour, four eggs leaving out two yolks — 
the whites of the eggs should be beaten to a snow — three 
quarters of a pint of ale yest. Beat the eggs and yest toge- 
ther, adding warm milk ; put it so beat into the flour, in which 
must be well rubbed four ounces of butter ; wet the whole into 
a soft paste. Keep beating it in the bowl with your hand 
for a quarter of an hour at least ; let it stand by the fire 
half an hour, then make it into rolls, and put them into pans 
or dishes, first well floured, or, what is still better, iron moulds, 
which are made on purpose to bake rolls in. Let them stand 
by the fire another half hour, and put them, bottom upwards, 
on tin plates, in the middle of a hot oven for three quarters of 
an hour or more : take them out, and rasp them. 

French Rolls, No. 2. 
Take two or three spoonfuls of good yest, as much warm 
water, two or three lumps of loaf-sugar, and the yolk of an 
egg. Mix all together ; let it stand to rise. Meanwhile take 
a quartern of the finest flour, and rub in about an ounce of 
butter. Then take a quart of new milk, and put into it a pint 
of boiling water, so as to make it rather warmer than new milk 
from the cow. Mix together the milk and yest, and strain 
through a sieve into the flour, and, when you have made it into 
a light paste, flour a piece of clean linen cloth well, lay it upon 
a thick double flannel, put your paste into the cloth, wrap it up 
close, and put it in an earthen pan before the fire till it rises. 
Make it up into ten rolls, and put them into a quick oven for 
a quarter of an hour. 

French Rolls. No. 3. 
To half a peck of the best flour put six eggs, leaving out 
two whites, a little salt, a pint of good ale yest, and as much 
new milk, a little warmed, as will make it a thin light paste. 
Stir it about with your hand, or with a large wooden spoon, 
but by no means knead it. Set it in a pan before the fire for 
about an hour, or till it rises; then make it up into little rolls, 
and bake it in a quick oven. 



332 CONFECTIONARY. 

Milton Rolls, 
Take one poufid of fine rye flour, a little salt, the yolk of one 
egg, a small cupful of yest, and some warm new milk, with a 
hit of hutter in it. Mix aU together ; let it stand one hour 
to rise ; and bake your rolls half an hour in a quick oven. 

Runnet, 
Take out the stomachs of fowls before you dress them ; wash 
and cleanse them thoroughly ; then string them, and hang them 
up to dry. When wanted for use, soak them in water, and 
boil them in milk ; this makes the best and sweetest whey. 

Another way. 

Take the curd out of a calf's maw; wash and pick it clean from 
the hair and stones that are sometimes in it, and season it well 
with salt. Wipe the maw, and salt it well, within and without, 
and put in the curd. Let it lie in salt for three or four days, 
and then hang it up. 

Rusks, 

Take flour, water, or milk, yest, and brown sugar ; work 
it just the same as for bread. Make it up into a long loaf, and 
bake it. Then let it be one day old before you cut it in slices : 
make your oven extremely hot, and dry them in it for about 
two minutes, watching them all the time. 

Another way. 

Put ^ye pounds of fine flour in a large basin ; add to it eight 
eggs unbeat, yolks and whites ; dissolve half a pound of sugar 
over the fire, in a choppin (or a Scotch quart) of new milk ; 
add all this to the flour with half a mutchkin, (one English 
pint) of new yest ; mix it well, and set it before a good fire 
covered with a cloth. Let it stand half an hour, then work it 
up with a little more flour, and let it stand half an hour longer. 
Tlien take it out of the basin, and make it up on a board into 
small round or square biscuits, place them upon sheets of white 
iron, and set them before the fire, covered with a cloth, till they 
rise, which will be in half an hour. Put them into the oven, 
just when the bread is taken out ; shut the oven till the biscuits 
turn brown on the top ; then take them out, and cut them 
through. 

Rusks, and Tops and Bottoms, 

Well mix two pounds of sugar, dried and sifted, with twelve 
pounds of flour, also well dried and sifted. Beat up eighteen 
eggs, leaving out eight whites, very light, with half a pint of 



CONFECTIONARY. 333 

new yest, and put it into the flour. Melt two pounds of butter 
in three pintsof new milk, and wet the paste with it to your liking. 
Make it up in little cakes; lay them one on another; when baked, 
separate them, and return them to the oven to harden. 

Sally Lunn. 

To two pounds of fine flour put about two table-spoonfols 
of fresh yest, mixed with a pint of new milk made warm. 
Add the yolks of three eggs, well beat up. Rub into the flour 
about a quarter of a pound of butter, with salt to your taste ; 
put it to the fire to rise, as you do bread. Make it into a cake, 
and put it on a tin over a chaffing-dish of slow coals, or on a 
hot hearth, till you see it rise ; then put it into a quick oven, 
and, when the upper side is well baked, turn it. When done, 
rasp it all over and butter it ; the top will take a pound of 
butter. 

Slip'Cote. 

A piece of runnet, the size of half-a-crown, put into a table- 
spoonful of boiling water over-night, and strained into a quart 
of new milk, lukewarm, an hour before it is eaten. 

Souffle. 
Two table-spoonfuls of ground rice, half a pint of milk or 
cream, and the rind of a lemon, pared very thin, sugar, and a 
bay-leaf, to be stewed together for ten minutes ; take out the 
peel, and let it stand till cold ; then add the yolks of four eggs, 
which have been well beaten, with sifted sugar; the four 
whites to be beaten separately to a fine froth, and added to the 
above, which must be gently stirred all together, put into a 
tin mould, and baked in a quick oven for twenty minutes. 

Another way. 
Make a raised pie of any size you think proper. Take some 
milk, a bay-leaf, a little cinnamon, sugar, and coriander seeds; 
boil it till it is quite thick. Melt a piece of butter in another 
stewpan, with a handful of flour well stirred in; let it boil 
some time; strain the milk through, and put all together, 
adding four or five eggs, beaten up for a long time ; these are 
to be added at the last, and then baked. 

Souffle of Apples and Rice, 

Prepare some rice of a strong solid substance ; dress it up 

all round a dish, the same height as a raised crust, that is, 

about three inches high. Have some marmalade of apple 

ready made ; mix with it six yolks of eggs, and a small piece 



334 CONFECTIONARY. 

of butter ; warm it on the stove in order to do the eggs ; then 
have eight whites of eggs well whipped, as for biscuits ; mix 
them lightly with the apples, and put the whole into the mid- 
dle of the rice. Set it in a moderately hot oven, and, when 
the souffle is raised sufficiently, send it up quickly to table, as 
it would soon fall and spoil. 

Strawberries f to preserve for eating with Cream. 

Take the largest scarlet strawberries you can get, full red,- 
but not too ripe, and their weight in double-refined sugar. 
Take more strawberries of the same sort ; put them in a pot, 
and set them in water over the fire to draw out the juice. To 
every pound of strawberries allow full half a pint of this juice, 
adding to it nearly a quarter of a pound more sugar. Dip all 
the sugar in water ; set it on the fire ; and, when it is tho- 
roughly melted, take it off, and stir it till it is almost cold. 
Then put in the strawberries, and boil them over a quick fire ; 
skim fiiem ; and, when they look clear, they are done enough. 
If you think the syrup too thin, take out the fruit, and boil it 
more ; but you must stir it till it is cold before you put the 
strawberries in again. 

Strawberries, to preserve in Currant Jelly. 

Boil all the ordinary strawberries you can spare in the water 
in which you mean to put the sugar to make the syrup for 
the strawberries. Take three quarters of a pound of the finest 
scarlet or pine strawberries; add to them one pound and a 
quarter of sugar, which dip in the above-mentioned strawberry 
liquor ; then boil the strawberries quick, and skim them clear 
once. When cold, remove them out of the pan into a China 
bowl. If you touch them while hot, you break or bruise 
them. Keep them closely covered with white paper till the 
currants are ripe, every now and then looking at them to see 
if they ferment or want heating up again. Do it if required, 
and put on fresh papers. When the currants are ripe, boil up 
the strawberries ; skim them well ; let them stand till almost 
cold, and then take them out of the syrup very carefully. Lay 
them on a lawn sieve, with a dish under them to catch the 
syrup ; then strain the syrup through another lawn sieve, to 
clear it of all the bits and seeds ; add to this syrup full half a 
pint of red and white currant juice, in equal quantities of each; 
then boil it quick about ten minutes, skimming it well. When 
it jellies, which you may know by trying it in a spoon, add 
the strawberries to it, and let them just simmer without boil- 
ing. Put them carefully into the pots, but, for fear of the 
strawberries settling at the bottom, put in a little of the ielly 



CONFECTIONARY. 335 

first and let it set ; then put in the strawberries and jelly ; 
watch them a little till they are cold, and, as the strawberries 
rise above the syrup, with a tea-spoon gently force them down 
again under it. In a few days put on brandy papers — ^they 
will turn out in a firm jelly. 

Strawberries, to preserve in Crooseherry Jelly, 
Take a quart of the sharpest white gooseberries and a quart 
of water ; let them come up to a boil, and then strain them 
through a lawn sieve. To a pint of the liquor put one pound 
of double-refined sugar ; let it boil till it jellies ; skim it very 
well, and take it off; when cool, put in the strawberries whole 
and picked. Set them on the fire ; let them come to a boil ; 
take them off till cold ; repeat this tiiree or four times till they 
are clear ; then take the strawberries out tjarefully, that they 
may not bruise or break, and boil the jelly till it is stiff. Put 
a little first in the bottom of your pots or glasses ; when set, 
put in the rest, first mixed with the strawberries, but not till 
nearly cold. 

Strawberry Jam — very good. 
To one pound of scarlet strawberries, which are by far the 
best for the purpose, put a pound of powdered sugar. Take 
another half pound of strawberries, and squeeze all their juice 
through a cloth, taking care that none of the seeds come through 
to the jam. Then boil the strawberries, juice, and sugar, over 
a quick fire ; skim it very clean ; set it by in a clean China 
bowl, covering it close with writing paper ; when the currants 
are ripe, add to the strawberries fidl half a pint of red currant 
juice, and half a pound more of pounded sugar : boil it all to- 
gether for about ten or twelve minutes over a quick fire, and 
skim it very well. 

Another way. 
Gather the strawberries very ripe ; bruise them fine ; put to 
them a little juice of strawberries ; beat and sift their weight 
in sugar, and strew it over them. Put the pulp into a preser- 
ving-pan ; set it on a clear fire, and boil it three quarters of an 
hour, stirring it all the time. Put it into pots, and keep it in 
a dry place, with brandy paper over it. 

Sugar, to clarify^ 
Break into pieces two pounds of double-refined sugar ; put 
it into a stewpan, with a pint of cold spring water ; when dis- 
solved, set it over a moderate fire ; beat about half the white of 
an egg ; put it to the sugar, before it gets warm, and stir it 
well together. When it boils, take off die scum ; keep it boil- 



336 CONFECTIONARY. 

ing till no scum rises and it is perfectly clear. Run it through 
a clean napkin ; put it in a bottle well corked, and it will keep 
for months. 

Syllabub, 
Take a quart of cream with a slice or two of lemon-peel, to 
be laid to soak in the cream. Take half a pint of sack and six 
spoonfuls of white wine, dividing it equally into your syllabub. 
Set your cream over the fire, and make it something more than 
lukewarm; sweeten both sack and cream, and put the cream 
into a spouted pot, pouring it rather high from the pot into the 
vessel in which you intend to put it. Let it be made about 
eight or nine hours before you want it for use. 

Another way. 
Mix a quart of cream, not too thick, with a pint of white 
wine, and the juice of two lemons ; sweeten it to your taste ; 
put it in a broad earthen pan; then whisk it up. As the froth 
rises, take it off with a spoon, and put it in your glasses, but do 
not make it long before you want them. 

Everlasting Syllabub — very excellent. ^ 

Take a quart and half a pint of cream, one pint of Rhenish 
vdne, half a pint of sack, the juice of three lemons, about a 
pound of double-refined sugar, beaten fine and sifted before you 
put it into the cream. Grate off the rinds of the three lemons 
used, put it with the juice into the wine, and that to the cream. 
Then beat all together with a whisk just half an hour ; take it 
up with a spoon; and fill your glasses. It will keep good nine 
or ten days, and is best three or four days old. 

Solid Syllabub, 

Half a pint of white wine, a wine-glass of brandy, the peel 
of a lemon grated and the juice, half a pound of powdered 
loaf-sugar, and a pint of cream. Stir these ingredients well 
together; then dissolve one ounce of isinglass in half a pint of 
water ; strain it ; and when cool add it to the syllabub, stirring 
it well all the time ; then put it in a mould. It is better made 
the day before you want it. 

Whipt Syllabub. 

Boil a quart of cream with a bit of cinnamon ; let it cool ; 
take out the cinnamon, and sweeten to your taste. Put in half 
a pint of white wine, or sack, and a piece of lemon-peel. Whip 
it with a whisk to a froth ; take it off with a spoon as it rises ; 
lay it on the bottom of a sieve ; put wine sweetened in the bot- 
tom of your glasses, and lay on the syllabub as high as you can. 



CONFECTIONARY. 337 

Taffy. 
Two pounds of moist sugar, an ounce of candied orange- 
peel, the same of citron, the juice of three lemons, the rind of 
two grated, and two ounces and a half of butter. Keep stir- 
ring these on the fire until they attain the desired consistency. 
Pour it on paper oiled to prevent its sticking. 

Trifle. No. 1. 

Take as many macaroons as the bottom of your dish will 
hold ; peel off the wafers, and dip the cakes in Madeira or 
mountain wine. Make a very thick custard, with pounded 
apricot or peach kernels boiled in it ; but if you have none, 
you may put some bitter almonds ; pour the custard hot upon 
the maccaroons. When the custard is cold, or just before the 
trifle is sent to table, lay on it as much whipped syllabub as the 
dish can hold. The syllabub must be done with very good 
cream and wine, and put on a sieve to drain before you lay it 
on the custard. If you like it, put here and there on the whip- 
ped cream bunches of preserved barberries, or pieces of rasp- 
berry jam. 

Trifle. No. 2. 

Take a quart of sweet cream ; boil it with a blade of mace 
and a little lemon-peel ; sweeten it with sugar ; keep stirring 
it till it is almost cold to prevent it from creaming at top ; 
then put it into the dish you intend to serve it in, with a spoon- 
ful or less of runnet. Let it stand till it becomes like cheese. 
You may perfume it, or add orange-flower water. 

Trifle, No. 3. 
Cover the bottom of your dish with maccaroons and ratafia 
cakes ; just wet them all through with mountain wine or raisin 
wine ; then make a boiled custard, not too thick, and when 
cold pour it over them. Lay a whipped syllabub over that. 
You may garnish with currant jelly. 

Trotter Jelly. 
Boil four sheep's trotters in a quart of water till reduced to 
a pint, and strain it through a fine sieve. 

Veal and Ham Pat^s. 

Chop six ounces of ready dressed lean veal and three ounces 

of ham very small; put it into a stewpan, with an ounce of 

butter rolled in flour, half a gill of cream, the same quantity 

of veal stock, a little lemon-p^el, cayenne pepper and salt, to 

Q 



338 CONFECTIONARY. 

which add, if you like, a spoonful of essence of ham and some 
lemon-juice. 

Venison Pasty, 
. Bone a neck and hreast of venison, and season them well 
with salt and pepper ; put them into a pan, with part of a neck 
of mutton sliced and laid over them, and a glass of red wine. 
Cover the whole with a coarse paste, and bake it an hour or 
two ; but finish baking in a puff paste, adding a little more 
seasoning and the gravy from the meat. Let the crust be half 
an inch thick at the bottom, and the top crust thicker. If the 
pasty is to be eaten hot, pour a rich gravy into it when it comes 
from the oven ; but, if cold, there is no occasion for that. The 
breast and shoulder make a very good pasty. It may be done 
in raised crust. A middle-sized pasty will take three hours* 
baking. 

Vol-aU'Vent. 
Take a sufficient quantity of puff-paste, cut it to the shape 
of the dish, and make it as for an apple pie, only without a top. 
When baked, put it on a sheet of writing paper, near the fire, 
to drain the butter, till dinner time. Then take two fowls, 
which have been previously boiled ; cut them up as for a fri- 
cassee, but leave out the back. Prepare a sauce, the white 
sauce as directed for boiled fowls. Wash a table-spoonful of 
mushrooms in three or four cold waters ; cut them in half, and 
add them also ; then thoroughly heat up the sauce, and have the 
chicken also ready heated in a little boiling water, in which 
put a little soup jelly. Strain the liquor from the chicken; 
pour a little of the sauce in the bottom of the paste, then lay 
the wings, &c. in the paste ; pour the rest of the sauce over 
them, and serve it up hot. The paste should be well filled to 
the top, and if there is not sauce enough more must be added. 

Wafers. 

Take a pint of cream, melt in it half a pound of butter, and 
set it to cool. When cold, stir into it one pound of well dried 
and sifted flour by degrees, that it may be quite smooth and 
not lumpy, also six eggs well beaten, and one spoonful of ale 
yest. Beat all these well together; set it before the fire, 
cover it, and let it stand to rise one hour, before you bake. 
Some order it to be stirred a little while to keep it from being 
hard at top. Sprinkle over a little powdered cinnamon and 
sugar, when done. 

Sugar Wafers, 

Take some double-refined sugar, sifted; wet it with the 
juice of lemon pretty thin, and then scald it over the fire till it

candies on the top. Then put it on paper, and ruh it ahout thin ; 
when almost cold, pin up the paper across, and put the wafers 
in a stove to dry. Wet the outside of the paper to take them 
off. You may make them red with clear gilliflowers boiled in 
water, yellow with safiron in water, and green with the juice 
of spinach. Put sugar in, and scald it as though white, and, 
with a pin, mark your white ones before you pin them up. 

Walnuts, to preserve. 
Take fine large walnuts at the time proper for pickling ; 
prick, with a large bodkin, seven or eight holes in each to let 
out the water ; keep them in water till they change colour or 
no longer look green; then put them over a fire in cold water 
to boil, till they feel just soft, but not too soft. Spread them 
on a coarse cloth to cool, and take away the water ; stick in 
each walnut three or four cloves, three or four splinters of 
cinnamon, and the same of candied orange ; then put them in 
pots or glasses. Boil a syrup, but not thick, which, when cold, 
pour over the walnuts, and let it stand a day or two; then pour 
the syrup off; add some more sugar ; boil it up once more, 
and pour it again over the walnuts. When cold, tie them up. 

White Walnuts. 
Take nuts that are neither too large nor too small ; peel them 
to the white, taking off all the green with care, and throw them 
into pump water as you peel them ; let them soak one night. 
Boil them quick in fair water, throwing in a handful or two 
of alum in powder, according to the quantity, that they may 
be very white. When boiled, put them in fresh -waiter, and 
take them out again in a minute ; lay them on a dry cloth to 
dry, and lard them with preserved citron; then put them in the 
syrup you have made for the purpose, while they were larding, 
and let them soak two or three days before you boil them quite ; 
the syrup must be very clear. One hundred walnuts make 
about three pounds of sweetmeats. 

Mustard Whey. 
Take milk and water of each a pint, bruised mustard seed 
an ounce and a half; boil these together till the curd is per- 
fectly separated : then strain the whey through a cloth, and add 
a little sugar, which makes it more palatable. 

Yest. 
Boil one ounce of hops in three quarts of water until reduced 
to about three pints. Pour it upon one pound of flour; make

340 CONFECTIONARY. 

it into a batter ; strain it through a colander, and, when nearly 
cold, put to it one pint of home-brewed yest. Put it into a 
bottle, and keep it for use. It should stand twenty- four or 
thirty hours before it is used. 

Excellent Yest, 

Put a pint of well boiled milk into a hasty-pudding, and beat it 
till cold and there are few lumps remaining; then put to it two 
spoonfuls of yest and two of white powdered sugar, and stir it 
well. Put it in a large bowl not far from the fire, and next 
morning you will find it risen and light. Put it all to your 
fiour, which must be mixed with as much warm milk and water 
as is necessary to make it into dough, and put it to rise in 
the common way. 

Potato Yest, 

Boil rather more than a quarter of a peck of potatoes ; bruise 
them through a colander ; add half a pound of fine flour, and 
thin it with cold water till it is like a thick batter. Add three 
table-spoonfuls of good yest ; let it stand for an hour, and make 
your bread. 

This yest will always serve to make fresh from. 

Another way. 

Weigh four pounds of raw potatoes pared ; boil them in five 
pints of water. Wash and rub them through a sieve with the 
water in which they were boiled. Add four table-spoonfuls of 
good brown sugar ; when milk- warm, put to the mixtiu*e three 
pennyworth of fresh yest ; stir it well, and let it work in an 
open vessel. It will be fit for use in about twelve or fourteen 
hours. 

About a pint and a half of this mixture will raise eighteen 
pounds of coarse flour ; it may be put to rise over-night and 
will be ready to knead the first thing in the morning. It should 
be left to rise in the loaf four or five hours, before it is put in 
the oven. 



PICKLES. 



General Directions, 

Stone jars, well glazed, are best for all sorts of pickles, as 
earthen vessels will not resist the vinegar, which penetrates, 
through them. 

Never touch pickles with the hand, or any thing greasy ; but 
always make use of a wooden spoon, and keep them closely 
tied down, in a cool, dry place. 

When you add vinegar to old pickles, let it boil, and stand 
till cold before you use it : on the contrary, when you make 
pickles, put it on the ingredients boiling and done with the 
usual spices. 

Green Almonds, 

Boil a quantity of vinegar proportionate to that of the 
isdmonds to be pickled, skim it, and put into it salt, mace, 
ginger, Jamaica and white pepper. Put it into a jar, and let it 
stand till cold. Throw your almonds into the liquor, which 
must cover them. 

Artichokes, 

Artichokes should be laid about six hours in a very strong 
brine of salt and water. Then put them into a pot of boiling 
water, and boil them till you can draw the leaves from the 
bottom, which must be cut smooth and clean, and put into a 
pot, with whole black pepper, salt, cloves, mace, bay-leaves, 
and as much white wine vinegar as will cover them. Lastly, 
pour upon them melted butter an inch thick, and cover them 
down close. When you take out any for use, put them into 
boiling water, with a piece of butter to plump them, and you 
may use them for whatever you please. 

Artichokes to boil in Winter. 
Boil your artichokes for half a day in salt and water ; put 
them into a pot of boiling water, allowing them to continue 



342 PICKLES. 

boiling until you can just draw off the leaves from the bottom; 
cut them very clean and smooth, and put them into the pot 
with cloves, mace, salt, pepper, two bay-leaves, and as much 
vinegar as will cover them. Pour melted butter over to 
cover them about an inch thick; tie and keep them close 
down for use, with a piece of butter to plump them. You 
may use these for what you like. 

Asparagus. 
Scrape the asparagus, and cut off the prime part at the ends ; 
wipe them, and lay them carefully in a jar or jelly-pot, pour 
vinegar over them, and let them lie in this about fourteen days. 
Then boil fresh vinegar, and pour it on them hot ; repeat this 
until they are of a good colour ; add a little mace and nut- 
meg, and tie them down close. This does very well for a made 
dish when asparagus is not to be had. 

Barberries, No. 1. 
Gather the barberries when full ripe, picking out those that 
look bad. Lay them in a deep pot. Make two quarts of 
strong brine of salt and water ; boil it with a pint of vinegar, 
a pound of white sugar, a few cloves, whole white pepper, and 
mace, tied in a bag ; skim it, and when cold pour it on your 
barberries. Barberries with stones will pickle ; they must be 
without stones for preserving. 

Barberries. No. 2. 
Colour the water of the worst barberries, and add salt till 
the brine is strong enough to bear an Qg^. Boil it for half an 
hour, skimming it, and when cold strain it ever the barberries. 
Lay something on them to keep them in the liquor : put them 
into a glass, and cover with leather. 

Barberries. No. 3. 
Boil a strong brine of salt and water, let it stand till quite 
cold, and pour it upon the barberries. 

Barberries. No. 4. 
Put into a jar some maiden barberries, with a good quantity 
of salt ; tie on a bladder, and when the liquor scums change it. 

Beet-root. 
Beet-root must be boiled in strong salt and water, to which 
add a pint of vinegar and a little cochineal. When boiled 
enough, take it off the fire, and keep it in the liquor in which 



PICKLES. 343 

it has been boiled. It makes a pretty garnish for a dish of 
fish, and is not unpleasant to eat. 

Another. 
Boil the root till tender, peel it, and, if you think proper, cut 
it into shapes. Pour over it a hot pickle of white^wine vine- 
gar, horseradish, a little ginger, and pepper. 

Beet-root and Turnips, 
Boil your beet-root in salt and water, with a little cochineal 
and vinegar; when half boiled, put in your turnips pared; when 
they are done enough, take them off, and keep them in the same 
liquor in which they were boiled. 

Cabbage. 
Shave the cabbage into long slips, or, if you like, cut it in 
quarters. Scald it in salt and water for about four minutes; 
then take it out, and let it cool. Boil some vinegar, salt, 
ginger, whole pepper, and mace ; after boiling and skimming 
it, let it get cold, and then put in your cabbage, which, if 
covered down presently, will keep white. 

Red Cabbage. No. I, 
Slice the cabbage very fine crosswise, put it on an earthen 
dish, sprinkle a handful of salt over it, coVer it with another 
dish, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Then put it in a 
colander to drain, and lay it in your jar ; take white wine vine- 
gar enough to cover it, a little cloves, mace, and allspice. Put 
them in whole with one pennyworth of cochineal, bruised fine; 
boil it up, and put it over the cabbage, hot, or cold, which you 
like best. Cover it close with a cloth till it is cold, and then 
tie it over with leather. 

Red Cabbage. No. 2. 

Slice the cabbage into a colander, sprinkle each layer with 

salt, let it drain two days; then put it into wide-mouthed 

bottles, pour on it boiling vinegar, sufficient to cover it, and 

add a few slices of beet-root. Cover the bottle with bladder. 

Red Cabbage. No. 3. 
Take a firm cabbage cut in quarters ; slice it ; boil your 
vinegar with ginger and pepper ; let it stand till cold ; then 
pour it over your cabbage, and tie it down. It will be fit for 
use in three weeks. 



344 PICKLES. 

Capers, 
Capers are the produce of , a small shrub, but preserved in 
pickle, and are grown in some parts of England, but they come 
chiefly from the neighbourhood of Toulon, the produce of which 
is considered the finest of any in Europe. The buds are 
gathered from the blossom before they open, and then spread 
on the floor, where the sun cannot reach them, and there they 
are left till they begin to wither ; they are then thrown into 
sharp vinegar, and in about three days bay salt is added in 
proper quantity, and when this is dissolved they are fit for 
packing for sale, and sent all over the world. 

Capsicum, 
Let the pods be gathered with the stalks on before they turn 
red, and with a penknife cut a slit down the side, and take out 
all the seed, but as little of the meat as possible. Lay them 
in strong brine for three days, changing the brine every dayv 
Take them out, lay them on a cloth, and another over them; 
Boil the liquor, put into it some mace and nutmeg beaten small; 
put the pods into a jar ; when the liquor is cold, pour it over 
them, and tie down with a bladder and leather. 

Cauliflower, 

Cut from the closest and whitest heads pieces about the 
length of your finger, and boil them in a cloth with milk and 
water, but not till tender. Take them out very carefully, and 
let them stand till cold. With the best white wine vinegar 
boil nutmeg, cut into quarters, mace, cloves, a little whole 
pepper, and a bay-leaf, and let it remain till cold. Pour this 
into the jar to your cauliflower, and in three or four days it 
will be ready for use. 

Another way. 

Having cut the flower in bunches, throw them for a minute 
into boiling salt and water, and then into cold spring water. 
Drain and dry them ; cover with double- distilled vinegar ; in 
a week put fresh vinegar, with a little mace and nutmeg, cover- 
ing down close. 

Clove Gilliflower, or any other Flower, for Salads, 

Put an equal weight of the flowers and of sugar, fill up with 
white wine vinegar, and to every pint of vinegar put a pound 
of sugar. 
> Codlings, 

The codlings should be the size of large walnuts ; put vine 
leaves in the bottom of your pan, and lay in the codlings, coverr 



PICKLES. 345 

ing with leaves and then with water ; set them over a gentle 
fire till they may be peeled ; then peel and put them into the 
water, with vine leaves at top and bottom, covering them close; 
set them over a slow fire till they become green, and, when they 
are cold, take off the end whole, cutting it round with a small 
knife ; scoop out the core, fill the apple with garlic and mus- 
tard seed, put on the bit, and set that end uppermost in the 
pickle, which must be double-distilled vinegar cold, with mace 
and cloves. 

Cucumbers. No. 1. 
Gather young cucumbers, commonly called gherkins — the 
small long sort are considered the best — wipe them very clean 
with a cloth ; boil some salt and water, and pour over them ; 
keep them close covered. Repeat this every day till they are 
green, putting fresh water every other day : let them stand 
near the fire, just to keep warm; the brine must be strong 
enough to bear an egg. When they are green, boil some white 
wine vinegar, pour it over them, put some mace in with them, 
and cover them with leather. It is better to put the salt and 
water to them once only, and they sliould be boiled up over the 
fire, in the vinegar, in a bell-metal kettle, with some vine leaves 
over, to green them. A brass kettle will not hurt, if very clean, 
and the cucumbers are turned out of it as soon as off the fire. 

Cucumbers. No. 2. 
In a large earthen pan mix spring water and salt well toge- 
ther, taking two pounds of salt to every gallon of water. 
Throw in your cucumbers, wash them well, and let them remain 
for twelve hours ; then drain and wipe them very dry, and put 
them into a jar. Put into a bell-metal pot a gallon of the best 
white wine vinegar, half an ounce of cloves and of mace, one 
ounce of allspice, one ounce of mustard-seed, a stick of horse- 
radish sliced, six bay-leaves, a little dill, two or three races of 
ginger, a nutmeg cut in pieces, and a handful of salt. Boil all 
together, and pour it over the cucumbers. Cover them close 
down, and let them stand twenty-four hours, then pour off the 
vinegar from them, boil it, pour it over them again, and cover 
them close : repeat this process every day till they are green. 
Then tie them down with bladder and leather ; set them in a 
cool dry place, and they will keep for three or four years. 
Beans may be pickled in the same manner. 

Cucumbers, No. 3. 
Wipe the cucumbers clean with a coarse cloth, and put them 
into a jar. Take some vinegar, into which put pepper, ginger,: 

q5 



346 PICKLES. 

cloves, and a handful of salt. Pour it boiling hot ever the 
cucumbers, and smother them with a flannel : let them stand a 
fortnight ; then take off the pickle, and boil it again. Pour it 
boiling on the cucumbers, and smother them as before. The 
pickle should be boiled in a bell-metal skillet. With two 
thousand cucumbers put into the pot about a pennyworth of 
Roman vitriol. 

Large Cucumbers, Mango of. 

Take a cucumber, cut out a slip from the side, taking out 
the seeds, but be careful to let as much of the meat remain as 
you can. Bruise mustard seed, a clove of garlic, some bits of 
horseradish, slices of ginger, and put in all these. Tie the piece 
on again, and make a pickle of vinegar, whole pepper, salt, 
mace, and cloves : boil it, and pour it on the mangoes, and con- 
tinue this for nine days together. When cold, cover them 
down with leather. 

Another* 

Scrape out the core and seed, filling them with whole pepper, 
a clove of garhc, and other spice. Put them into salt and water, 
covered close up, for twenty-four hours ; then drain and wipe 
them dry. Boil as much vinegar with spice as will cover them, 
and pour it on them scalding hot. 

Cucumbers sliced. 

Take cucumbers not full grown, slice them into a pewter dish; 
to twelve cucumbers put three or four onions sliced, and as 
you do them strew salt on them ; cover them with a pewter 
dish, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Then take out 
the onions, strain the liquor from the cucumbers through a 
colander, and put them in a well glazed jar, with a pickle made 
of white wine vinegar, distilled in a cold still, with seasoning of 
mace, cloves, and pepper. The pickle must be poured boiling 
hot upon them, and then cover them down as close as possible. 
In four or five days take them out of the pickle, boil it, and 
pour it on as before, keeping the jar very close. Repeat this 
three times ; cover the jar with a bladder, and leather over it; 
the cucumbers will keep the whole year, and be of a fine sea- 
green, but perhaps not of so fine colour when first you open 
them ; they will become so, however, if the vinegar is really 
fine. 

Cucumbers stuffed. 

Take six or eight middling-sized cucumbers, the smoothest 
you can procure ; pare them, cut a small piece off the end, 
and scoop out all the seeds ; blanch them for three or four 
minutes in boiling water on the fire ; then put them into cold 



PICKLES. 347 

water to make the forcemeat. Then take some veal off the 
leg, calf s udder, fat bacon, and a piece of suet, and put it in 
boiling water about four minutes ; take it out, and chop all 
together ; put some parsley, small green onions, and shalots, 
all finely chopped, some salt, pepper, and nutmeg, sufficient 
for seasoning it, some crumbs of bread that have been steeped 
in cream, the whites of two eggs, and four yolks beaten well 
in a mortar. Stuff your cucumbers with this, and put the 
piece you cut off each upon it again. Lay at the bottom of 
your stewpan some thin slices of bacon, with the skin of the 
veal, onions in slices, parsley, thyme, some cloves ; put your 
cucumbers in your stewpan, and cover them with bacon, &c., 
as at the bottom, and then add some strong broth, just suffi- 
cient to cover them. Set them over a slow fire covered, and 
let them stew slowly for an hour. Make some brown gravy 
of a good colour, and well tasted ; and, when your cucumbers 
are stewed, take them out, drain them well from all grease, 
and put them in your brown gravy ; it must not be thick. Set 
it over the stove for two minutes, and squeeze in the juice of 
a lemon. 

To make brown gravy, put into your stewpan a quarter of 
a pound of butter ; set it over the foe, and, when melted, put 
in a spoonful of flour, and keep stirring it till it is as brown as 
you wish, but be careful not to let it bum ; put some good 
gravy to it, and let it boil some time, with parsley, onions, 
thyme, and spices, and then strain it to your cucumbers. 

Should any of the cucumbers be left at dinner, you may 
serve them up another way for supper ; cut the cucumbers in 
two, lengthwise, or, if you like, in round slices ; add yolks of 
eggs beaten, and dust them all well over with crumb of bread 
rubbed very fine ; fry them very hot; make them of a good 
colour, and serve them in a dish, with fried parsley. 

Cucumbers, to preserve. 
Take some small cucumbers, and large ones that will cut in 
quarters, but let them be as green and as free from seeds as 
you can get them. Put them into a narrow-mouthed jar, in 
strong salt and water, with a cabbage-leaf to keep them from 
rising ; tie a paper over them, and set them in a warm place 
till they are yellow. Then wash them out, and set them over 
the fire in fresh water, with a little salt and a fresh cabbage-leaf 
over them. Cover the pan very close, but be sure you do not 
let them boil. If they are not of a fine green, change the 
water, which will help them ; then make them hot, and cover 
them as before. When you find them of a good green, take 



343 PICKLES^ 

them o£F the fire, and let them stand till they are cold : then 
cat the large ones into quarters; take out the seeds and s<^ 
parts, put them into cold water, and let them stand two days; 
but change ,the water twice each day, to take out the salt ; put 
a pound of refined sugar to a pint of water, and set it over th^ 
fire ; when you have skimmed it clear, put in the rind of a * 
lemon and an ounce of ginger, scraping off the outside. Take 
your syrup off as soon as it is pretty thick, and, when it is 
cold, wipe the cucumbers dry and put them into it. Boil the 
syrup once in two or three days for three weeks, and 
strengthen the syrup if required, for the greatest danger of 
spoiling them is at first. When you put the syrup to th^ 
pucumbers, wait till it is quite cold. 

French Beans. No. 1 . 
Gather them when very slender ; string and parboil thenoi in 
very strong salt and water ; then take them out, and dry them 
between two linen cloths. When they are well drained, put 
them into a large earthen vessel, and, having boiled up the 
same kind of pickle as for cucumbers, pour as much upon your 
beans as will cover them well. Strain the liquor from them 
three days successively ; boil it up, and put your beans into 
the vinegar on the fire till they are warm through. After the 
third boiling, put them into jars for use, and tie them down. 

French Beans, No. 2. 
Take from the small slender beans their stalks, and let them 
remain fourteen days in salt and water ; then wash and well 
cleanse them from the brine, and put them in a saucepan of 
water over a slow fire, covering them with vine-leaves. Do. 
not let them boil, but only stew, until they are tender, as for 
eating ; strain them off, lay them on a coarse cloth to dry, and 
put them into pots ; boil and skim alegar, and pour it over, 
covering them close ; keep boiling in this manner for three or 
four days, or until they become green ; add spice, as you would 
to other pickles, and, when cold, cover with leather. 

French Beans. No. 3. 
Put in a large jar a layer of beans, the younger the better, 
and a layer of salt, alternately, and tie it down close. When 
wanted for use, boil them in a quantity of boiling water: 
change the water two or three times, always adding the fresh 
water boiling ; then put them into cold water to soak out the 
salt, and cut them when you want them for dressing for table. 
They must not be soaked before they are boiled. 



PICKLES'. 349 

Herrings, to marinate. 
Take a quarter of a hundred of herrings ; cut off their heade 
and tails ; take out the roes, and clean them ; then take half an 
ounce of Jamaica and half an oimce of common pepper, an 
ounce of bay salt, and an ounce and a half of common salt ; 
beat the pepper fine, mix it with the salt, and put some of this 
seasoning into the belly of each herring. Lay them in rows, 
and between every row strew some of the seasoning, and lay 
a bunch or two of thyme, parsley, and sage, and three or four 
bay-leaves. Cover your fish with good vinegar, and your pot 
with paste; put the pot into the oven after the household 
bread is drawn ; let it remain all night ; and, when it comea 
out of the oven, pour out all the liquor, take out the herbs ; 
again boil up the liquor ; add as much more vinegar as will 
cover the herrings, skim it clean, and strain it. When cold, 
pour it over your herrings. 

Herrings y red. Trout fashion. 
Cut off their heads, cleanse them well, and lay a row at the 
bottom of an earthen pot, sprinkling them over with bay salt 
and saltpetre, mixed together. Repeat this until your pan is 
full ; then cover them, and bake them gently ; when cold, they 
will be as red as anchovies, and the bones dissolved. 

India Pickle, called Picolili. No. 1 . 
Lay one pound of ginger in salt and water for a whole night ; 
then scrape and cut it in thin slices, and lay them in the sun to 
dry ; put them into a jar till the other ingredients are ready. 
Peel two pounds of garlic, and cut it in thin slices ; cover it 
with salt for three days ; drain it well from the brine, and dry 
it as above directed. Take young cabbages, cut them in quar- 
ters, salt them for three days, and dry them as above ; do the 
same with cauliflowers, celery, and radishes, scraping the latter 
and leaving the tops of the celery on, French beans, and aspa- 
ragus, which last two must be salted only two days, and dried 
in the same manner. Take long pepper and salt it, but do not 
dry it too much, three ounces of turmeric, and a quarter of a 
pound of mustard seed finely bruised ; put these into a stone 
jar, and pour on them a gallon of strong vinegar ; look at it 
now and then, and if you see occasion add more vinegar.; 
Proceed in the same manner with plums, peaches, melons, 
apples, cucumbers ; artichoke bottoms must be pared and cut 
raw ; then salt them, and give them just one gentle boil, putting 
them into the water when hot. Never do red cabbage or wal- 
nuts. The: more every thing is dried, the plumper it will be- 



350 PICKLES. 

come in the vinegar. Put in a pound or two of whole garlic 
prepared as abore to act as a pickle. You need never empty 
the jar, as the pickle keeps ; but as things come into season, do 
them and throw them in, observing that the vinegar always 
covers them. If the ingredients cannot be conveniently dried 
by the sun, you may do them by the fire, but the sun is best. 

India Pickle. No. 2. 
Select the closest and whitest cabbage you can get, take off 
the outside leaves, quarter and cut them into thin slices, and 
lay them upon a sieve ; salt well between each layer of the 
cabbage, and let it drain till the next day ; then dry it in a 
doth, and spread it in dishes before the fire, or the sun, often 
turning it till dry. Put it in a stone jar, with half a pint of 
white mustard seed, a little mace and cloves beat to a powder, 
as much cayenne as will he on a shilling, a large head of gar* 
lie, and one pennyworth of turmeric in powder. Pour on it 
tiiree quarts of vinegar boiling hot ; cover it close with a doth, 
and let it stand a fortnight ; then turn it all out into a sauce- 
pan. Boil it, turning it often, about eight minutes, and put 
it up in your jar for use. It will be ready in a month* If 
other things are put in, they should lie in salt three days and 
then be dned ; in this case, it will be necessary to make the 
pickle stronger, by adding ginger and horseradiidi, and it must 
be kept longer before used. 

India Pickle. No. 3. 
Boil one pound of salt, four ounces of ginger, eight ounces 
of shalots or garlic, a spoonful of cayenne pepper, two ounces 
of mustard seed, and six quarts of good vinegar. When cold, 
you may put in green fruit or any vegetable you choose, fresh 
as you pick them, only wiping off the dust. Stop your jar 
close, and put in a little turmeric to colour it. 

Lemons. No. 1. 
Cut the lemons through the yellow rind only, into eight 
parts ; then put them into a deep pan, a layer of salt and a 
layer of lemons, so as not to touch one another ; set them in 
the chimney comer, and be sure to turn them every day, and 
to pack them up in the same manner as before. This you most 
continue doing fifteen or sixteen days ; then take them out of 
the salt, lay them in a flat pan, and put them in the sun every 
day for a month ; or, if there should be no sun, before the fire ; 
* then put them in the pickle ; in about six months they will be 
fit to eat. Make the pickle for them as follows : Take two 



t>ICKLE8. 851 

pounds of peeled garlic, eight pods of India pepper, when it is 
green ; one pound and a half of ginger, one pound and a quar* 
ter of mustard seed, half an ounce of turmeric ; each clove of 
the garlic must he split in half; the ginger must he cut in small 
slices, and, as no green ginger can he had in Europe, you must 
cover the ginger with salt in a clean earthen vessel, until it is 
soft, which it will be in about three weeks, or something more, 
by which means you may cut it as you please ; the mustard 
seed must be reduced, but not to powder, and the turmeric 
pounded fine : mix them well together, and add three ounces of 
oil of mustard seed. Put these ingredients into a gallon of the 
best white wine vinegar boiled ; then put the whole upon the 
lemons in a glazed jar, and tie them up close. They will not 
be fit in less than six months. When the vinegar is boiled, 
let it stand to be cold, or rather lukewarm, before you put 
it to the lemons, and if you use more than a gallon of vine- 
gar, increase the quantity of each ingredient in proportion. 
Strictly observe the direction first given, to let the lemons lie 
in salt fifteen or sixteen days, to turn them every day, and to 
let them be thoroughly dry before you put the pickle to them ; 
it will be a month at least before they are sufficiently dry. 

Lemons. No. 2. 
Take twelve lemons pared so thin that not the least of the 
whites is to be seen ; slit them across at each end, and work 
in as much salt as you can, rubbing them very well within and 
without. Lay them in an earthen pan for three or four days, 
and strew a good deal of salt over them ; then put in twelve 
cloves of garlic, and a large handful of horseradish ; dry the 
lemons with the salt over them in a very slow oven, till the 
lemons have no moisture in them, but the garlic and thtf horse- 
radish must not be dried so much. Then take a gallon of 
vinegar, cloves, mace, and nutmegs, broken roughly, half an 
oimce of each, and the like quantity of cayenne pepper. Give 
them a boil in the vinegar ; and, when cold, stir in a quarter of 
a pound of flour of mustard, and pour it upon the lemons, 
garlic, &c. Stir them every day, for a week together, or more. 
When the lemons are^ used in made dishes, shred them very 
small ; and, when you use the liquor, shake it before you put it 
to the sauce, or in a cruet. When the lemons are ^ied, they 
must be as hard as a crust of bread, but not burned. 

Lemons. No. 3. 
Take two dozen lemons, cut off about an inch at one end, 
scoop (Hit all the pulp, fill them with salt, and sew on the tops. 



S52 FTCKLES; 

Let them continue over the mouth of an oven, or in any slo!W 
heat, for about three weeks, till they are quite dried. Take out 
the salt ; lay them in an earthen jar ; put to them six quarts 
of the best vinegar which has been boiled ; add some lon^ x>ep-* 
per, mace, ginger, and cinnamon, a few bay-leaves, four cloves " 
of garlic, and six ounces of the best flour of mustard. When 
quite cold, cover up the jar, and let it stand for three weeks or 
a month. Then strain off the liquor, and bottle it. 

Lemons. No. 4. 
Quarter the lemons lengthwise, taking care not to cut them 
so low as to separate ; put a table-spoonful of salt into each. 
Set them on a pewter dish ; dry them very slowly in a cool 
oven or in the sun ; they will take two or three weeeks to dry 
properly. For a dozen large lemons boil three quarts of vine- 
gar, with two dozen peppercorns, two dozen allspices, and four 
races of ginger sliced. When the vinegar is cold, put it, with 
the lemons, the ingredients, and all the salt, into a jar ; add a 
quarter of a pound of flour of mustard and two dozen cloves of 
gar]ic ; the garlic must be peeled and softened in scalding water 
for a little while, then covered with salt for three days, and 
dried before it is put into the jar. Let the whole remain for 
two months closely tied down and stirred every day ; then 
squeeze the lemons well ; strain and bottle the liquor. 

Lemons. No. 5. 
Select small thick-rinded lemons ; rub them with a flannel ; 
slit them in four parts, but not through to the pulp ; stuff the 
slits fall of salt, and set them upright in a pan. Let them re- 
main thus for five or six days, or longer if the salt should not 
be melted, turning them three times a day in their own liquor, 
until they become tender. Then make a pickle of rape, vine- 
gar, and the brine from the lemons, ginger, and Jamaica pepper. 
Boil and skim it, and when cold put it to the lemons, with 
three cloves of garlic, and two ounces of mustard seed. This 
is quite sufficient for six lemons. 

Lemons. No. 6. 
Boil them in water and afterwards in vinegar and sugar, and 
then cut them in slices. 

Lemons, or Oranges. 
Select fruit free from spots ; lay them gently in a barrel. 
Take pure water, and make it so strong with bay-salt as that it 
would bear an egg ; with this brine fill up the barrel, and dose 
it tight.

Mango Cossundria, or Pickle. 
Take of green mangoes two pounds, green ginger one pound, 
yellow mustard seed one poimd ; half dried chives, garlic, salt, 
mustard, oil, of each two ounces ; fine vinegar, four bottles. 
Cut the mangoes in slices lengthwise, and place them in the 
sun till half dried. Slice the ginger also ; put the whole in a 
jar well closed, and set it in the sun for a month. This pickle 
will keep for years, and improves by age. 

Melons, 

Scoop your melons clean from the pulp ; fill them with 
scraped horseradish, ginger, nutmeg, sliced garlic, mace, pep- 
per, mustard-seed, and tie them up. Afterwards take the best 
white wine vinegar, a quartered nutmeg, a handful of salt, 
whole pepper, cloves, and mace, or a little ginger ; let the 
vinegar and spice boil together, and when boiling hot pour it 
over the fruit, and tie them down very close for two or three 
days ; but, if you wish to have them green, let them be put 
over a fire in their pickle in a metal pot, until they are scsdd^ 
ing hot and green ; then pour them into pots, and stop them 
close down, and, when cold, cover them with wet bladder and 
leather. 

Melons to imitate Mangoes, 

Cut off the tops of the melons, so as that you may take out 
the seeds with a small spoon ; lay them in salt and water, 
changing it every twenty-four hours for nine successive days : 
then take them out, wipe them dry, and put into each one clove 
of garlic or two small shalots, a slice or two of horseradish, a 
slice of ginger, and a tea-spoonful of mustard seed ; this being 
done, tie up their tops again very fast with packthread, and 
boil them up in a sufficient quantity of white wine vinegar, 
bay-salt, and spices, as for cucumbers, skimming the pickle as 
it rises ; put a piece of alum into your pickle, about the size of 
a walnut ; and, after it has boiled a quarter of an hour, pour 
it, with the fruit, into your jar or pan, and cover it with a 
cloth. Next day boil your pickle again, and pour it hot upon 
your melons. After this has been repeated three times, and 
the pickle and fruit are quite cold, stop them up as directed for 
mushrooms. These and all other pickles should be set in a 
dry place, and frequently inspected ; and, if they grow mouldy, 
you must pour off the liquor and boil it up as at first. 

Melons or Cucumbers, as Mangoes, 
Pour over your melons or other vegetables boiling hot salt 
and water, and dry them the next day ; cut a piece out of the

side; scrape away the seed very clean; and fill them with scraped 
horseradish, garlic, and mustard seed ; then put in the piece, 
and tie it close. Pour boiMng hot vinegar over them, and in 
about three days boil up the vinegar with cloves, pepper, and 
ginger : then throw in your mangoes, and boil them up quick 
for a few minutes ; put them in jars, which should be of stone, 
and cover them close. 

The melons ought to be small and the cucumbers large. 
Should they not turn out green enough, the vinegar most be 
boiled again. 

Mushrooms, No. 1. 

Gather your mushrooms in August or September, and ped 
off the uppermost skin; cut the large ones into quarters, and, 
as you do them, throw them into clear water, but be very care- 
ful not to have any worm-eaten ones. You may put the buttons 
in whole ; the white are the best, and look better than the red. 
Take them out, and wash them in another clear water; then put 
them into a dry skillet without water ; and with a little salt set 
them on the fire to boil in their own liquor, till half is consumed 
and they are as tender as you wish them; as the scum rises, 
take it off. Remove them from the fire : pour them into a 
colander, and drain off all the water. Have ready pickle, boiled 
and become cold again, made of the best white wine vinegar ; 
then add a little mace, ginger, cloves, and whole pepper : boil 
it ; put your mushrooms in the pickle when cold, and tie them 
up close. 

Mushrooms. No. 2. 

Put your mushrooms into salt and water, and wash them 
clean with a flannel, throw them into water as you do them ; 
then boil some salt and water : when it boils, put in your 
mushrooms, and let them boil one minute. Take them out, 
and smother them between two flannels ; when cold, put them 
into white wine vinegar, with what spice you choose. The 
vinegar must be boiled and stand till cold. Keep them closely 
tied down with a bladder. A bit of alum is frequently put to 
keep them firm. 

The white mushrooms are done the same way, using milk 
and water instead of salt and water, distilled vinegar in the 
room of white wine vinegar, no spices except mace, and a lump 
of alum. 

Mushrooms, No. 3. 

Cut off the stalks of the small hard mushrooms, called but- 
tons, and wash and rub them dry in a clean flannel. Boil some 
water and salt, and while boiling put in the mushrooms. Let

them just boil, and strain them through a cloth. Make a 
pickle of white wine vinegar, mace, and ginger, and put to 
them ; then put them into pots, with a little oil over them, 
and stop them close. 

Mushrooms. No. 4. 
Put young mushrooms into milk and water ; take them out, 
dry them well, and put them into a brine made of salt and 
spring water. Boil the brine, an'd put in the mushrooms ; 
boil them up for five minutes ; drain them quick, covering 
them up between two cloths and drying them well. Boil a 
pickle of double-distilled vinegar and mace ; when it is cold, 
put in the buttons, and pour oil on the top. It is advisable to 
put them into small glass jars, as they do not keep after being 
opened. It is an excellent way to boil them in milk. 

Mushrooms. No. 5. 
Put your mushrooms into water ; rub them very clean with 
a piece of flannel ; put them into milk and water, and boil them 
till they are rather tender. Then pour them into an earthen 
colander, and piunp cold ^ater on them till they are quite cold. 
Have ready some salt and water ; put them into it; let them 
lie twenty-four hours ; then dry them in a cloth. Then put 
them into a pickle made of the best white wine vinegar, mace, 
pepper, and nutmeg. If you choose to boil your pickle, it 
must be quite cold before you put in the mushrooms. 

Mushrooms. No. 6. 
Peel your mushrooms, and throw them into clean water ; 
wash them in two or three waters, and boil them in a little 
water, with a bundle of sweet-herbs, a good quantity of salt, a 
little rosemary, and spice of all sorts. When well boiled, let 
them remain in the liquor for twenty-four hours; pour the 
liquor into a hot cloth, smothering them for a night and a 
day; then put in your pickle, which make of elder and white 
wine vinegar, with all kinds of spice, horseradish, ginger, and 
lemon-juice. Put them into pots, cover with oiled paper, 
and keep them close for use. 

Mushrooms., No. 7. 
Clean them very well, and take out the gills ; boil them 
tender with a little salt, and dry them with a cloth. Make a 
strong brine ; when it is cold, put in the mushrooms, and in 
about ten days or a fortnight change the brine, and put them 
into small battles, pouring oil on ti^e top. 



356 PICKLES. 

Brown Mushrooms, 
Wipe them very clean, put them into a stewpan with 
^lace, cloves, pepper, and sjdt, and to every quart of mush- 
rooms put about two large spoonfuls of muslu'ooin ketchup ; 
stew them gently over a slow fire for about half an hour, then 
let them cool. Put them into bottles. To each quart of mush- 
rooms put a quarter of a pint of white wine vinegar boiled and 
cooled ; stop the bottles close with rosin. 

Mushrooms, to dry,. 

Cut off their stalks, and cut or scrape out the gills, and with 
a little salt put them into a saucepan. Set them on the fire, 
and let them stew in their ovm liquor ; then pour them into a 
sieve to drain. When dry, put them into a slack oven upon 
tin plates, and, when quite dry, put them into shallow boxes 
for use. 

The liquor will make ketchup. 

Mushroom Liquor and Powder, 
Take about a peck of muslu-ooms, wash them, and rub them 
with a piece of flannel, taking out the gills, but do not peel- 
them. Put to them half an ounce of beaten pepper, four bay- 
leaves, four cloves, twelve blades of mace, a handftd of salt, 
eight onions, a bit of butter, and half a pint of vinegar ; stew 
all these as quick as possible ; keep stirring till the liquor is 
quite out of the mushrooms ; then drain them, and bottle the 
liquor and spice when cold. Dry the mushrooms in an oven, 
first on a flat or broad pan, then on sieves, until they can be 
beaten into powder. This quantity will make about seven 
ounces. Stop the powder close in wide-mouthed bottles. 

Mustard Pickle. 
Cut cabbages, cauliflowers, and onions, in small pieces or 
slices ; salt them together, and let them stand in the salt for a 
few days. Then take them up in a strainer that the brine may 
run off; put them in a jar that will hold three quarts ; take 
enough vinegar to cover them ; boil it up, pour it on them, 
and cover it till next day. Pour the vinegar off, take the liluiie 
quantity of fresh vinegar, of black pepper, ginger, and Jamaica 
pepper, each one otlnce ; boil them up together, let the liquor 
stand till cold ; then mix four tea- spoonfuls of turmeric, and 
six ounces of flour of mustard, which pour on them cold. 
Cover the pickle up close ; let it stand three weeks ; and it 
will be fit for use. The spices must be put in whole. 



PICKLES. 357 

Nasturtiums, 
TTie seed must be full grown and gathered on a dry day. 
Let them lie two or three days in salt and water ; take them 
out, well dry them, and put them into a jar. Take as much 
white wine vinegar as will cover them, and boil it up with 
mace, sliced ginger, and a few bay leaves, for a quarter of an 
hour. Pour the pickle upon the seeds boiling hot. This must 
be repeated three days, keeping them covered with a folded 
cloth. After the third time, take care to let them be quite 
cold before you stop them up, which you must do very close. 

Onions. No. 1. 
Take your onions when they are dry enough to lay up for 
winter, the smaller the better they look : put them in a pot, 
cover them with spring water, with a handful of salt, and 
let them boil up ; then strain them off. Take off three coats; lay 
them on a cloth, and let two persons take hold of it, one at each 
end, and rub them backwards and forwards till they are very 
dry. Then put them in your jars or bottles, with some blades 
of mace, cloves, and nutmeg, cut into pieces; take some double- 
distilled white wine vinegar, boil it up with a little salt ; let 
it stand till it is cold, and put it over the onions. Cork them 
close, and tie a bladder and leather over them. 

Onions. No. 2. 

Take the smallest onions you can get ; peel and put them 
into .spring water and salt made very strong. Shift them daily 
for six days ; then boil them a very little ; skim them well, and 
make a pickle as for cucumbers, only adding a little mustard 
seed. Let the onions and the pickle both be cold, when you 
put them together. Keep them stopped very close, or they win 
spoil. 

Onions. No. 3. 

Peel some small white onions, and boil them in water with 
salt ; strain them, and let them remain tiU cool in a cloth. Make 
the pickle as for mushrooms ; when quite cold, put them in and 
cover them down. Should the onions become mouldy, boil 
them again, carefully skimming off the impurities ; then let 
them cool, and proceed as at first. 

Cauliflowers are excellent done in this way. 

Onions. No. 4. 
Put your small onions, after peeling them, into salt and 
water, shifting them once a day for three or four days: set 
them over the fire in milk and water till ready to boil ; dry

them ; and, when boiled and cold, pour over a pickle made ol 
double-distilled vinegar, a bay-leaf or two, salt, and mace. 

Onions, No. 5. 

Parboil small white onions, and let them cool. Make a 
pickle with half vinegar, half wine, into which put some salt, a 
little ginger, some mace, and sliced nutmeg. Boil all this up 
together, skimming it well. Let it stand till quite cold ; then 
put in your onions, covering them down. Should they become 
mouldy, boil the liquor again, but skim it well; let it stand till 
quite cold before the onions are again put in, and they will keep 
all the year. 

Onions, No. 6. 

Take the small white roimd onions; peel off the brown skin. 
Have ready a stewpan of boiling water; throw in as many 
onions as will cover the top. As soon as they look clear on 
the outside, take them up quickly, lay them on a clean doth, 
and cover them close with another cloth. 

Spanish Onions, Mango of. 

Having peeled your onions, cut out a small piece from the 
bottom, scoop out a little of the inside, and put them into salt 
and water for three or four days, changing the brine twice a 
day. Then drain and stuff them, first putting in flour of mus- 
tard, then a little ginger cut small, mace, shalot cut small, then 
more mustard, and filling up with scraped horseradish. Put 
on the bottom piece, and tie it on close. Make a strong pidde 
of white wine vinegar, ginger, mace, sliced horseradi^, nut- 
meg, and salt : put in your mangoes, and boil them up two or 
three times. Take care not to boil them too much, otherwise 
they lose their firmness and will not keep. Put them, with the 
pickle, into a jar. Boil the pickle again next morning, and 
pour it over them. 

Orange and Lemon Peel. 

Boil the peels of the fruit in vinegar and sugar, and lay them 
in the pickle ; but be careful to cut them in small long slices, 
about the length of half the peel of your lemon. It must be 
boiled in water previously to boiling in sugar and vineg^. 

Oysters, No. 1. 
Take a quantity of large oysters with their liquor; wash well 
all the grit from them, and to every three pints of clear water 
put half an ounce of bruised pepper, some salt, and a quarter of 
an ounce of mace. Let these boil over a gentle fire, until a 
fourth part is consumed, skimming it ; just scald the oysters.

of their liquor with yinegar, a pint of white wine, mace, salt 
and pepper ; boil and skim it, and when cold put in the oysters, 
and keep them. 

Oysters. No. 3. 

Take whole pepper and mace, of each a quarter of ^an ounce, 
and half a pint of white wine vinegar. Set the oysters on the 
fire, in their own liquor, with a little water, mace, pepper, and 
half a pound of salt ; skim them well as they heat, and only 
allow them just to boil for fear of hardening them. Take them 
out to dry, skim the liquor, and then put in the rest of the spice 
with the vinegar. Should the vinegar be very strong, reduce 
it a little, and boil it up again for a short time. Let both stand 
till cold : put your oysters into 4;he pickle : in a day or two, 
taste your pickle, and, should it not be sharp enough, add a 
little more vinegar. 

Oysters, No. 4. 

Take the largest oysters you can get, and just plump them 
over the fire in their own liquor; then strain it from them, and 
cover the oysters close in a clotli. Take an equal quantity of 
white wine and vinegar, and a little of the oyster liquor, with 
mace, white pepper, and lemon-peel, pared very thin, also salt, 
the quantity of each according to your judgment and taste, 
taking care that there be sufficient liquor to cover them. Set 
it on the fire, and, when it boils, put in the oysters ; just give 
them one boil up ; put the pickle in a pot, and the oysters 
closely covered in a cloth till the pickle is quite cold. 

Oysters. No. 5. 
Simmer them, till done, in their own liquor ; take them out 
one by one, strain the liquor from them, and boil them witt

hoard ; take them out and dry them, and with a sharp knife 
cut them open and take out the stone ; then cut some garlic 
very fine, scrape a great deal of horseradish, mix the same 
quantity of mustard seed, a few bruised cloves, and ginger 
sHced very thin, arid with this fill the hollow of the peaches. 
Tie them round, and lay them in a jar ; throw in some broken 
cinnamon, cloves, mace, and a smaU quantity of cochineal^ and 
pour over as much vinegar as will fill the jar. To every quart 
put a quarter of a pint of the best mustard, well made, some 
cloves, mace, nutmeg, two or three heads of garlic, and some 
sliced ginger. Mix the pickle well together ; pour it over tht 
peaches, and tie them down close with either leather or a blad- 
der. They will soon be fit for use. 

In the same manner you may do white plums. 

Pur slain. Samphire, Broom Buds, 8fC, 
Pick the dead leaves from the branches of purslain, and 
lay them in a pan. Make some strong brine ; boil and skim 
it clean, and, when boiled and cold, put in the purslain, and 
cover it ; it will keep all. the year. When wanted for use, boil 
it in fresh water, having the water boiling before you put it in. 
When boiled and turned green, cool it, take it out afterwards, 
put it into wide-mouth bottles, with strong white wine vine- 
gar to it, and close it for use. 

Quinces. 
Cut in pieces half a dozen quinces ; put them into an earthen 
pot, with a gallon of water and two pounds of honey. Mix the 
whole togetiber, and boil it leisurely in a kettle for half an 
hour. Strain the liquor into an earthen pot : and, when cold, 
wipe the quinces clean, and lay them in it. Cover them very 
close, and they will keep all the year. 

Radish Pods» 
Make a pickle with cold spring water and bay salt, strong 
enough to bear an egg ; put in your pods ; lay a thin board on 
them to keep them under water, and let them stand ten days. 
Drain them in a sieve, and lay them on a cloth to dry ; then 
take as much white wine vinegar as you think will cover them, 
boil and put your pods in a jar, with ginger, mace, cloves, 
and Jamaica pepper ; put your vinegar boiling hot on them ; 
cover them with a coarse cloth three or four times double, that 
the steam may come through a httle, and let them stand two 
days ; repeat this two or three times. When cold, put in a 
pint of mustard-seed and some horseradish, and cover them

PICKLES. 361 

Salmon. No. 1. 
Cut off the head of the fish, take out the intestines, but do 
not slit the belly ; cut your pieces across, about two or three 
inches in breadth ; take the blood next to the back clean out : 
wash and scale it ; then put salt and water over the fire, and a 
handful of bay leaves; put in the salmon, and, when it is 
boiled, take it off and skim it clear. Take out the pieces with 
a skimmer as whole as you can ; lay them on a table to drain ; 
strain a handful of salt slightly over them ; when they are cold, 
stick some cloves on each side of them. Then take a cask, 
well washed, and seasoned with hot and cold water, three or 
four days before you use it ; put in the pickle you boiled your 
salmon in hot, some time before yoi^ use it ; then take broad 
mace, sliced nutmeg, white pepper, just bruised, and a little 
black ; mix the pepper with salt, sufficient to season the sal- 
mon ; strew some pepper, salt, and bay-leaves, at the bottom 
of the cask ; then put in a layer of salmon, then spice, salt, 
bay-leaves, and pepper, as before, until the cask is full. Put 
on the head, and bore a hole in the top of it ; fill up the cask 
with good white wine vinegar, cork it, and, in two or three 
days, take out the cork and put more vinegar, and the fat will 
come out ; do so three or four times ; then cut off the cork, and 
pitch it ; if it be for present use, put it in a jar, closely covered. 

Salmon. No. 2. 
Well scrape the salmon, take out the entrails, and well wash 
and dry it. Cut it in pieces of such size as you think proper ; 
take three parts of common vinegar and one of water, enough 
to cover the fish. Put in a handful of salt, and stir it till dis- 
solved. Add some mace, whole pepper, cloves, sliced nutmeg, 
and boil all these till the salmon is sufficiently done. Take it 
out of the liquor, and let it cool. Put it into a barrel, and over 
every layer of salmon strew black pepper, mace, cloves, and 
pounded nutmeg ; and, when the barrel is full, pour upon the 
salmon the liquor in which it was boiled, mixed with vinegar, 
in which a few bay-leaves have been boiled, and then left tiU 
cold. Close up the barrel, and keep it for use. 

Salmon, No. 3. 
Cut your fish into small slices, and clean them well from the 
blood, by wiping and pressing them in a dry cloth ; afterwards 
lay it in a kettle of boiling water, taking care not to break it, 
and, when nearly boiled, make a pickle as follows : two quarts 
of water, three quarts of rape vinegar; boil it with a little fen-

nel and salt till it tastes strong ; then skim it ; let it cool ; lay 
tl^e fish in a kettle, and pour the pickle to it pretty warm. 

The same process will do for sturgeon, excepting the fennel, 
and putting a little more salt, or for any other fish. 

Salmon, to marinate. 
Cut your salmon in round slices about two inches thick, and 
tie it with matting, like sturgeon; season it with pepper, 
mace, and salt ; then put it into a broad earthen pan, with an 
equal quantity of port wine and vinegar to cover it, and add 
three or four bay-leaves. The pickle also must be seasoned 
with the spices above-mentioned. The pan must be covered 
with a coarse cloth, ani^baked with household bread. 

Samphire. 
Pick and lay it in strong brine, cold ; let it remain twenty- 
four hours, boil the brine once on a quick fire, and pour it 
immediately on the samphire. After standing twenty-four 
hours, just boil it again on a quick fire, and stand till cold. 
Lay it in a pot, let the pickle settle, and cover the samphire 
with the clear portion of the pickle. Set it in a dry place, and, 
should the pickle become mothery, boil it once a month, 
and, when cold, put the samphire into it. 

Smelts, 

Lay the smelts in a pot in rows, and lay upon them sliced 
lemon, mace, ginger, nutmeg, pepper, powdered bay-leaves, 
and salt. Make pickle of red wine vinegar, saltpetre, and 
bruised cochineal ;^ when cold, pour it on the smelts, and cover 
the pot close. 

Suckers, before the leaves are hard. 

Pare off all the hard ends of the leaves and stalks of the 
suckers, and scald them in salt and water, and, when cold, put 
them into glass bottles, with three blades of mace, and thin 
sliced nutmeg ; fill them with distilled vinegar. 

Vinegar for Pickling, No. 1. 
Take the middling sort of beer, but indifferently hopped, let 
it work as long as possible, and fine it down with isinglass ; 
then draw it from the sediment, and put ten pounds weight of 
the husks of grapes to every ten gallons. Mash them toge- 
ther, and let them stand in the sun, or, if not in smnmer, in a 
close room, heated by fire, and, in about three or four weeks, 
it will become an excellent vinegar. Should you not have

vinegar will not prove so good either in taste or body. Cyder 
will make a decent sort of vinegar, and also unripe grapes, or 
plums, but foul white Rhenish wines, set in a warm place, 
will fine, naturally, into good vinegar. 

Vinegar. No. 2. 
To a pound and a half of the brownest sugar put a gallon of 
warm water; mix it well together; then spread a hot toast 
thick with yest, and let it work very well about twenty- four 
hours. Skim off the toast and the yest, and pour off the clear 
liquor, and set it out in the sun. The cask must be full, and, 
if painted and hooped with iron hoo^s, it will endure the wea- 
ther better. Lay a tile over the bunghole. 

Vinegar. No. 3. 
To every gallon of water put three pounds of Malaga rai- 
sins ; stop it up close, and let it stand in the cellar two years. 

Camp Vinegar. 
Infuse a quarter of an ounce of cayenne, four heads of gar- 
lic, some shalots, half a drachm of cochineal, a quarter of a 
pint of ketchup, soy, walnut pickle, and an ounce of black, 
white, and long pepper, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg, all grossly 
bruised, a little mace, and cloves, in a quart of the best wine 
vinegar ; cork it close, and put a leather and bladder over it. 
Let it stand before the fire for a month, shaking it frequently. 
You must let it stand upon the ingredients, and fill up with 
vinegar as you take any out. This is not only an excellent 
sauce, but a powerful preservative against infectious disorders. 

Another. 
Half an ounce of cayenne pepper, a large head of garlic, 
half a drachm of cochineal, two spoonfuls of soy, the same of 
walnut pickle, and a pint of vinegar. 

Chili Vinegar. 
Gather the pods of capsicum when full ripe ; put them into 
a jar with a clove of garlic and a little cayenne pepper ; boil 
the vinegar, and pour it on hot ; fill up your jar : let it stand 
for a fortnight ; pour it off clear, and it will be fit for use. 

Elder-flower Vinegar. No. 1. 
Put two gallons of strong alegar to a peck of the pips of 
elder-fiowers, set it in the sun in a stone jar for a fortnight,

and then filter it through a flannel bag ; when you draw it off, 
put it into small bottles, in which it will preserve its flavour 
better than in larger ones ; when you mix the flowers and the 
alegar together, be careful not to drop any stalks amongst the 
pips. 

Elder-flower Vinegar. No. 2. 
Take good vinegar, fill a cask three quarters full, and gather 
some elder -flowers, nearly or moderately blown, but in a dry 
day ; pick oflf the small flowers and sprigs from the greater 
stalks, and air them well in the sun, that they may grow dry, 
but not so as to break or crumble. To every four gallons of 
vinegar put a pound of them, sewing them up in a fine rag. 

Elder-flower Vinegar. No. 3. 
Pick the flowers before they are too much blown from the 
stalks, and dry them in the sun, but not when it is very hot. 
Put a handful of them to a quart of the best white wine vine- 
gar, and let it stand a fortnight. Strain and draw it oflT, and 
put it into a cask, keeping out about a quart. Make it very 
hot, and put it into your cask to produce fermentation. Stop 
it very close, and draw it off when wanted. 

Elder-flower Vinegar, No. 4. 
Gather the elder-flowers in dry weather, pick them clean 
from the stalks, and put two pints of them to a gallon of the 
best white wine vinegar. Let them infuse for ten days, stir- 
ring them every day till the last day or two ; then strain off 
the vinegar, and bottle it. 

Garlic Vinegar, 
Take sixty cloves, two nutmegs sliced, and eight cloves of 
garlic, to a quart of vinegar. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. 
To every gallon of water take six pounds of full ripe goose- 
berries ; bruise them, and put them into a vessel, pouring the 
water cold upon them. Set the vessel in a hot place till the 
gooseberries come to the top, which they will do in about a 
fortnight ; then draw off the liquor, and, when you have taken 
the gooseberries out of the vessel, measure the liquor into it 
again, and to every gallon put a pound of coarse sugar. It 
will work again, and, when it has done working, stop it down 
close, set it near the fire or in the -sun: it will be fit for use in 
about six months. If the vessel is not full, it will be ready 
sooner. 



PICKLES. 365 

Plague, or Four Thieves' Vinegar, 
Take rue, sage, mint, rosemary, wormwood, and lavender, 
of each a large handful; put them into a stone jar, with a gallon 
of the best vinegar ; tie it down very close, and let it stand a 
fortnight in the sun, shaking the jar every day. Bottle it, and 
to every bottle add a quarter of an ounce of camphor, beaten 
very fine. The best time to make it is in June or July. 

Raisin Vinegar, 
Put four quarts of spring water to two pounds of Malaga 
raisins, lay a stone or slate over the bung-hole, and set it in 
the sun till ready for use. If you put it into a stone jar or 
bottle, and let it stand in the chimney corner, for a proper time, 
it will answer the same purpose. 

Raspberry Vinegar. No. 1. 

Fill a very large jug or jar with raspberries ; then pour as 
much white wine vinegar upon them as it will hold; let it 
stand four days, stirring it three times every day. Let it 
stand four days more, covered close up, stirring it once a day. 
Strain it through a hair sieve, and afterwards through a flannel 
bag ; and to every pint of liquor add one pound of loaf-sugar. 
Simmer it over the fire, skimming it all the time, till quite 
clear. As soon as cold, bottle it. 

This is very good sauce for a plain batter pudding and pan- 
cakes. 

Raspberry Vinegar. No. 2. 

Take two pounds of sugar ; dissolve it in a pint of water ; 
then clarify, and let it boil till it is a thick syrup. Take the 
same quantity of raspberries, or currants, but not too ripe, 
and pour over them a quarter of a pint of vinegar, in which 
they must steep for twenty-four hours. Pour the fruit and 
vinegar into the syrup, taking care not to bruise the fruit; 
then give it one boil, strain it, and cork it up close in bottles. 
The fruit must be carefully picked and cleaned, observing not 
to use any that is in the least decayed. To the syrup of 
currants a few raspberries may be added, to heighten the fla- 
vour. An earthen pipkin is the best to boil in. 

Raspberry Vinegar, No. 3. 
Fill a jug with raspberries; add as much of the best vinegar 
as the jug will hold ; let the fruit steep ten or twelve days ; 
then strain the liquor through a fine sieve, without squeezing 
the raspberries; put three pounds of lump sugar to a quart of 
juice, and skim it.

put them in your pickle pot ; when the pot is half full, put in 
some shalots, and a head of garlick. To a hundred of walnuts 
add half an ounce of allspice, half an ounce of black pepper, 
six bay-leaves, and a stick of horseradish. Then fill your pots,

with a pin. 

Walnuts. No. 2. 

About midsiunmer take your walnuts, run a knitting-needle 
through them, and lay them in vinegar and salt, sulficiently

leaf. Put them into fresh vinegar, seasoned with salt, mace, . 
mustard, garlic, and horseradish ; and to a hundred nuts put 
one ounce of ginger, one ounce of pepper, and of cloves and 
mace a quarter of an ounce each, two small nutmegs, and

have the largest double nuts, being the best to pickle. 

Walnuts. No. 3. 
Take the large French nuts, wipe them clean, and wrap each 
in a vine-leaf ; put them into a weak brine of salt and water 
for a fortnight, changing it every day, and lay a slate upon 
them, to keep them always under, or they will turn black. 
Drain them, and make a stronger brine, that will bear an egg; 
let them lie in that a fortnight longer ; then drain and wipe 
them very dry, and wrap them in fresh vine-leaves ; put them 
in jars, and pour on them double-distilled vinegar, which must 
not be boiled. To six or eight hundred nuts put two pounds 
of shalots, one of garlic, and one of rocambole ; a piece of 
assafoetida, of the size of a pea, tied up in a bit of muslin, and 
put into each jar, of white, black, and long pepper, one pound 
each, half a pound of mace, a quarter of a pound of nutmegs, 
two ounces of cinnamon, two ounces of cloves, two pounds of 
allspice, one pound of ginger, two pounds of mustard-seed,

the assafoetida in the middle ; and as the pickle wastes take 
care to keep the jar filled up with vinegar. 

Walnuts, No. 4. 
Take a hundred walnuts, at the beginning of July, before 
they are shelled ; just scald them, that the skin may rub off, 
then put them into salt and water, for nine or ten days; shift 
them every day, and keep them covered from the air: dry 
them ; make 3'our pickle of two quarts of white wine vinegar, 
long pepper, black pepper, and ginger, of each half an ounce ;

boil up the pickle, pour it over the nuts, and tie them down 
close. Repeat this process for three days. 

Walnuts, green. 
Wipe and wrap them one by one in a vine-leaf : boil crab 
verjuice, and pour it boiling hot over the walnuts, tying them 
down close for fourteen days ; then take them out of the leaves 
and liquor, wrap them in fresh leaves, and put them in your 
pots. Over every layer of walnuts, strew pepper, mace, cloves, 
a little ginger, mustard seed, and garlic. Make the pickle of 
the best white wine vinegar, boiling in the pickle the same sort 
of spices, with the addition of horseradish, and pour it boil- 
ing hot upon the walnuts. Tie them close down ; they will be 
ready to eat in a month, and will keep for three or four years.

when it has done working and is ready to bottle, put in some 
ginger sliced, an orange stuck full of cloves, and cut here and 
there with a knife, and a pound and a half of sugar. With a

morning make a slow fire in the still, and while it is distilling 
keep a wet cloth about the neck of the still. Put so much white 
sugar-candy as you think fit into the glass where it drops. 

Bitters.

tion to the quantity of liquor ; strain it in two or three days 
from the flowers, and put it into a cask, with two or three 
table-spoonfuls of lemon-juice to every two gallons. Add, if 
you please, a small quantity of brandy, and, in ten months, 
bottle it.

quarter of an hour ; take the scum off, and let it stand till cold. 
Put it to your brandy ; add two quarts of white wine, and 
strain it through a flannel bag ; fill the cask, and it will clarify 
itself. You may bottle it in a week. Orange-peel greatly 
improves this liquor.

Noyau. 
To one gallon of the best white French brandy, or spirit 
diluted to die strength of brandy, put two pounds and a half 
of bitter almonds blanched, two pounds of white sugar-candy, 
half an ounce of mace, and two large nutmegs. To give it a 
red colour, add four pounds of black cherries. It must be well 
shaken every day for a fortnight ; then let it stand for six weeks, 
and bottle it off: it improves much by longer keeping. 

Orange Juice. 
One pound of fine sugar to a pint of juice ; run it through a 
jelly-bag, and boil it for a quarter of an hour; when cold, 
skim and bottle it. 

Spirit of Oranges or Lemons. 
Take the thickest rinded oranges or lemons ; pare off the 
rinds very thin ; put into a glass bottle as many of these chips 
as it will hold, and then as much Malaga sack as it will hold 
besides. Stop the bottle down close, and, when you use it, 
take about half a spoonful in a glass of sack. It is a fine spirit 
to mix in sauces for puddings or other sweet dishes. 

Cordial Orange Water. 
Take one dozen and a half of the highest coloured and thick- 
rinded oranges ; slice them, and put them into two pints of 
Malaga sack, and one pint of the best brandy. Take cinnamon, 
nutmegs, ginger, cloves, and mace, of each one quarter of an 
ounce bruised, and of spearmint and balm one handful of 
each; put them into an ordinary stDl all night, pasted up 
with rye paste. The next day, draw them with a slow fire, 
and keep a wet cloth upon the neck of the still; put the 
loaf sugar into the glass in which it drops. 

Orgeat. 
Two quarts of new milk, one ounce of sweet almonds and 
eighteen bitter, a large piece of cinnamon, and fine sugar 
to your taste. Boil these a quarter of an hour, and then 
strain. The almonds must be blanched, and then pounded 
fine with orange-flower water. 

Another way. 
Four ounces of sweet almonds finely pounded, two ounces 
of white sugar- candy, dissolved in spring- water, and a quart of 
cream ; mix all together. Put it into a bottle, and give it a 
gentle shake when going to be used.

Excellent Punch. 

Three pints of barley-water and a piece of lemon-peel ; let 
it stand till cold ; then add the juice of six lemons and about 
half a pint of the best brandy, and sweeten it to your taste, 
and put it in ice for four hours. Put into it a little champagne 
or Madeira. 

Milk Punch, 

To twenty quarts of the best rum or brandy put the peels of 
thirty Seville oranges and thirty lemons, pared as thin as pos- 
sible. Let them steep twelve hours. Strain the spirit from the 
rinds, and put to it thirty quarts of water, previously boiled and 
left to stand till cold. Take fifteen pounds of double-refined 
sugar, and boil it in a proper proportion of the water to a 
fine clear syrup. As soon as it boils up, have ready beat to a 
froth the whites of six or eight eggs, and the shells crumbled 
fine ; mix them with the syrup ; let them boil together, and, 
when a cap of scum rises to the top, take off the pot, and skim 
it perfectly clear. Then put it on again with some more of the 
beaten e^g, and skim it again as before. Do the same with the 
remainder of the ^gg until it is quite free from dirt; let it stand 
to be cool. Strain it to the juice of the oranges and lemons ; put 
it into a cask with the spirit ; add a quart of new milk, made 
lukewarm ; stir the whole well together, and bung up the cask. 
Let it stand till very fine, which will be in about a month or 
six weeks — but it is better to stand for six months — then 
bottle it. The cask should hold fifteen gallons. This punch 
will keep for many years. 

Many persons think this punch made with brandy much finer 
than that with rum. The best time for making it is in March, 
when the fruit is in the highest perfection. 

Another way. 

Take six quarts of good brandy, eight quarts of water, two 
pounds and a half of lump sugar, eighteen lemons, and one 
large wine-glassful of ratafia. Mix these well together ; then 
throw in two quarts of boiling skimmed milk ; stir it well, and 
let it stand half an hour ; strain it through a very thick flannel 
bag till quite fine ; then bottle it for use. Before you use this 
punch, soak for a night the rinds of eighteen lemons in some of 
the spirit ; then take it out, and boil it in the milk, together with 
two large nutmegs sliced. 

Norfolk Punch, 

Take four gallons of the best rum ; pare a dozen lemons and 
a dozen oranges very thin ; let the pulp of both steep in the 



378 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &e. 

rum twenty-four hours. Put twelve pounds of double-refined 
sugar into six gallons of water, with the whites of a dozen 
eggs beat to a ^th ; boil and scum it well ; when cold, pnt it 
into the vessel with the rum, together with six quarts of orange- 
juice, and that of the dozen of lemons, and two quarts of new 
milk. Shake the vessel so as to mix it ; stop it up very close, 
and let it stand two months before you bottle it. 

This quantity makes twelve gallons of the Duke of Nor- 
folk's punch. It is best made in March, as the fruit is then 
in the greatest perfection. 

Roman Punch, 
The juice of ten lemons, and of two sweet oranges, the peel 
of an orange cut very thin, and two pounds of powdered loaf- 
sugar, mixed together. Then take the white of ten eggs, 
beaten into froth. Pass the first mixture through a sieve, and 
then mix it- by degrees, always beating with the froth of the 
eggs; put the whole into an ice-lead ; let it freeze a little; then 
add to it two bottles of champagne, or rum. Turn it round 
with a ladle. The above is for twelve persons. 

Raspberry Liqueur, 
Bruise some raspberries with the back of a spoon, strain 
them, and fill a bottle with the juice ; stop it, but not very close. 
Add to a pound of fruit nearly a pound of sugar dissolved into 
a syrup. Let it stand four or five days ; pour it from the fruit 
into a basin ; add to it as much rich white wine as you think fit ; 
bottle it, and in a month it will be fit to drink. 

Raspberry Vinegar, 
Fill a jar with raspberries, gathered dry, and pour over them 
as much of the best white wine vinegar as will cover them. 
Let them remain for two or three days, stirring them frequently, 
to break them ; strain the liquor through a sieve, and to every 
pint of it put a pound and a quarter of double-refined sugar ; 
boil it, and take off the scum as it rises. When cool, bottle 
and cork it up for use. A spoonful of tliis liquor is suffi- 
cient for a small tumbler of water. 

Ratafia Brandy. 
Apricot or peach kernels, with four ounces of fine sugar to 
a quart of brandy. If you cannot get apricot kernels, two 
ounces of bitter almonds, bruised a little, to the same quantity 
of spirit, will make good ratafia. 



WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 379 

Shrub. No. 1. 
To a gallon of rum put three pints of orange-juice and one 
pound of sugar, dissolving the sugar in the juice. Then put 
all together in the cask. It will be fine and fit for use in a few 
weeks. If the rum be very strong, you may add another pint 
of juice and half a pound of sugar to the above. 

Shrub. No. 2. 

Take two quarts of the juice of oranges and lemons, and 
dissolve in it four pounds and a half of sugar. Steep one- 
fourth part of the oranges and lemons in nine quarts of spirits 
for one night ; after which mix the whole together ; strain it 
off into a jug, which must be shaken two or three times a day 
for ten days ; then let it stand to settle for a fortnight ; after 
which draw it off very carefully, without disturbing the 
sediment. 

Shrub. No. 3. 

One gallon of rum, one pound and two ounces of double- 
refined sugar, one quart of orange-juice, mixed and strained 
through a sieve. 

Currant Shrub. 

Pick the currants from the stalks ; bruise them in a marble 
mortar ; run the juice through a flannel bag. Then take two 
quarts of the clear juice ; dissolve in it one pound of double- 
refined sugar, and add one gallon of rum. Filter it through a 
flannel bag till quite fine. 

Spruce Beer. 

For one quarter cask of thirty gallons take ten or twelve 
ounces of essence of spruce and two gallons of the best 
molasses ; mix them well together in five or six gallons of 
warm water, till it leaves a froth ; then pour it into the cask, 
and fill it up with more water. Add one pint of good yest or 
porter grounds ; shake the cask well, and set it by for twenty- 
four hours to work. Stop it down close. Next day, draw it 
off into bottles, which should be closely corked and set by in a 
cool cellar for ten days, when it will be as fine spruce -beer as 
ever was drunk. The grounds will serve instead of yest for a 
second brewing. 

In a hot climate, cold water should be used instead of warm. 

Bittany Wine. 
Take six gallons of water and twelve pounds of sugar ; put 
your sugar and water together. Let it boil two hours ; then, 
after taking it off the fire, put in half a peck of sage, a peck 



380 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 

and a half of bittany, and a small bunch of rosemary ; cover, 
and let it remain till almost cold ; then put six spoonfuls of 
ale yest; stir it well together, and let it stand two or three 
days, stirring two or three times each day. Then put it in your 
cask, adding a quarter of a pint of lemon-juice ; when it has 
done working, bimg it close, and, when fine, bottle it. 

Sham Champagne, 
To every pound of ripe green gooseberries, when picked 
and bruised, put one quart of water ; let it stand three days, 
stirring it twice every day. To every gallon of juice, when 
strained, put three pounds of the finest loaf sugar ; put it into 
a barrel, and, to every twenty quarts of liquor add one quart 
of brandy and a little isinglass. Let it stand half a year ; 
then bottle it. The brandy and isinglass must be put in 
six weeks before it is bottled. 

Cherry Wine, 
Pound morella cherries with the kernels over-night, and set 
them in a cool place. Squeeze them through canvas, and to 
each quart of juice put one pound of powdered sugar, half an 
ounce of coarsely-pounded cinnamon, and half a quarter of an 
ounce of cloves. Let it stand about a fortnight in the sun, 
shaking it twice or three times every day. 

Another way. 
Take twenty-four pounds of cherries, cleared from the stalks, 
and mash them in an earthen pan ; then put the pulp into a 
flannel bag, and let them remain till the whole of the juice has 
drained from the pulp. Put a pound of loaf sugar into the 
pan which receives the juice, and let it remain until the sugar 
is dissolved. Bottle it, and, when it has done working, you 
may put into each bottle a small lump of sugar. 

Cowslip Wine, No. 1. 
To twenty gallons of water, wine measure, put fifty pounds 
of lump sugar ; boil it, and skim it till it is very clear ; then 
put it into a tub to cool, and, when just warm, put to it two 
tea-spoonfuls of ale yest. Let it work for a short time ; then 
put in fifteen pecks of cut cowslips, and the juice of twenty 
large lemons, likewise the outward rinds pared off as thin as 
possible. Keep it in the tub two or three days, stirring it 
twice each day. Then put it all together in a barrel, cleansed 
and dried. Continue to stir twice a day for a week or more. 



WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 381 

till it has done working ; then stop it up close for three 
months, and bottle it off for use. 

The cowslips should be gathered in one day, and the wine made 
as soon as possible after, as the fresh flowers make the wine of a 
finer colour than when they are withered ; but they will not hurt 
by being kept for a few days if they are spread on a cloth, and 
moved every day. 

Cowslip Wine, No. 2. 
To a gallon of water put three pounds of lump sugar ; boil 
them together for an hour, skimming all the while. Pour it 
upon the cowslips, and, when milk warm, put into it a toast, 
with yest spread pretty thick upon it ; let it stand all night, and 
then add two lemons and two Seville oranges to each gallon. 
Stir it well in a tub twice a day for two or three days ; then 
turn it ; stir it every day for a fortnight, and bung it up close. 
It will be fit for bottling in six weeks. To every gallon of 
water you must take a gallon of cowslips. They must be per- 
fectly dry before they are used, and there should be as many 
gallons of cowslips as gallons of water ; they should be mea- 
sured as they are picked, and turned into the cask. Dissolve 
an ounce of isinglass, and put to it when cold. The lemons 
must be peeled. 

Cowslip Wine, No. 3. 
Take fourteen gallons of water and twenty-four pounds of 
sugar ; boil the water and sugar one hour ; skim it till it is 
clear. Let it stand till nearly cold ; then pour it on three 
bushels of picked cowslips, and put to it three or four spoon- 
fuls of new yest ; let it stand and work in your vessel till the 
next day ; then put in the juice of thirty lemons and the peels 
of ten, pared thin. Stir them well together; bung up the vessel 
close for a month ; then bottle it. 

Currant Wine, No. 1. 
Gather the currants dry, without picking them from the 
stalks ; break them with your hands, and strain them. To 
every quart of juice put two quarts of cold water, and four pounds 
of loaf sugar to the gallon. It must stand three days, before 
it is put into the vessel. Stir it every day, and skim it as long 
as any thing rises. To ten gallons of wine add one gallon of 
brandy, and one of raspberries, .when you put it in the vessel. 
Let it stand a day or two before you stop it ; give it air four- 
teen days after ; and let it stand six weeks before you tap it. 

Currant Wine. No. 2. 
To every gallon of ripe currants put a gallon of cold water. 
When well broken with tiie hands, let it stand twenty-four hours. 



382 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 

Then squeeze the currants well out; measure your juice, and to 
every gallon put four pounds of lump sugar. When the sugar 
is well melted, put the wine into a cask, stirring it every day, 
till it has done hissing ; then put into it a quart of brandy to 
every five gallons of wine ; close it well up ; bottle it in three 
months. 

Currant Wine, No. 3. 

Put into a tub a bushel of red currants and a peck of white; 
squeeze them well, and let them drain through a sieve upon 
twenty- eight pounds of powdered sugar. When quite dissolved, 
put into the barrel, and add three pints of raspberries, and a 
little brandy. 

Currant or Elder Wine. 

After pressing the fruit with the hand or otherwise, to every 
gallon of juice add two gallons of water that has been boiled 
and stood to be cold. To each gallon of this mixture put five 
pounds of Lisbon sugar. It may be fermented by putting into 
it a small piece of toasted bread rubbed over with good yest. 
When put into the cask, it should be left open till the fermenta- 
tion has nearly subsided. 

Black Currant Wine, 

Ten pounds of fruit to a gallon of water ; let it stand two or 
three days. When pressed off, put to every gallon of liquor 
four pounds and a half of sugar. 

Red Currant Wine, 

Gather the fruit dry ; pick the leaves from it, and to every 
twenty-five pounds of currants put six quarts of water. Break 
the currants well, before the water is put to them ; then let 
them stand twenty-four hours, and strain the liquor, to every 
quart of which put a pound of sugar and as many raspberries 
as you please. 

Another way. 

Take twenty-four pounds of currants ; bruise them, and add 
to that quantity three gallons of water. Let it stand two days, 
stirring it twice a day ; then strain the liquor from the fruit ; 
and to every quart of liquor put one pound of sugar. Let it stand 
three days, stirring it twice a day ; then put it in your barrel, 
and put into it six-pennyworth of orris-root well bruised. The 
above quantities wUl make five gallons. 

Bed or White Currant Wine, 

Take to every gallon of juice one gaUon of water, to every 

gallon of water three pounds and a half of the best Lisbon 

sugar. Squeeze the currants through a sieve ; let the juice 

stand till the sugar is dissolved ; dip a bit of brown paper in 



WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 383 

brimstone, and burn in the cask. Then tun the wine, and to 
every three gallons put a pint of brandy. When it has done 
hissing, stop it close ; it will be fit to drink in six months, but 
it will be better for keeping ten or twelve. 

White Currant Wine, 

To each sieve of currants take twenty-five pounds of moist 
sugar, and to every gallon of juice two gallons of water. 
Squeeze the fruit well with the hands into an earthen pan ; 
then strain it through a sieve. Throw the pulp into another 
pan, filling it with water, which must be taken from the quan- 
tity of water E^lowed for the whole, and to every ten gallons of 
wine put one bottle of brandy. In making the wine, dissolve 
the sugar in the water above-mentioned, and put it into the cask; 
then add the remaining juice and water, stirring it well up 
frequently. Stir it well every morning for ten successive days, 
and as it works out fill up the cask again until it has done fer- 
menting. Then put in your brandy, and bung it quite close. 
In about eight months it will be fit to drink ; but, if you leave 
it twelve, it will be better. 

Damson Wine» 

Take four gallons of water, and put to every gallon four 
pounds of Malaga raisins and half a peck of damsons. Put the 
whole into a vessel without cover, having only a linen cloth 
laid over it. Let them steep six days, stirring twice every day; 
then let them stand six days without stirring. Draw the juice 
out of the vessel, and colour it with the infused juice of dam- 
sons, sweetened with sugar till it is like claret wine. Put it 
into a wine vessel for a fortnight ; then bottle it up ; and it 
may be drunk in a month. 

All made wines are the better for brandy, and will not keep 
without it. The quantity must be regulatecl by the degree of 
strength you wish to give to your wine. 

Elder Wine. No. 1. 
Take elderberries, when ripe; pick them clean from the 
stalk; press out the juice tlu-ough a hair sieve or canvas- 
bag, and to every gaUon of juice put three gallons of water on 
the husks from which the juice has been pressed. Stir the 
husks well in the water, and press them over again ; then mix 
the first and second liquor together, and boil it for about an 
hour, skimming it clean as long as the scum rises. To every 
gallon of liquor put two pounds of sugar, and skim it again 
very clean ; then put to every gallon a blade of mace and as 
much lemon-peel, letting it boil an hour. After the sugar is 
|mt ID, strain it into ja tub, and, when quite cold, put it into a 



384 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 

cask ; bung it close down, and look frequently to see that the 
bung is not forced up. Should your quantity be twelve gallons 
or more, you need not bottle it off till about April, but be sure 
to do so on a clear dry day, and to let your bottles be perfectly 
dry ; but if you have not more than five or six gallons, you 
may bottle it by Christmas on a clear fine day. 

Elder Wine. No. 2. 
To a gallon of water put a quarter of a peck of berries, and 
three pounds and a half of Lisbon sugar. Steep the berries in 
water forty hours ; after boiling a quarter of an hour, strain the 
liquor from the fruit, and boil it with the sugar till the scum 
ceases to rise. Work it in a tub like other wines, with a small 
quantity of yest. After some weeks, add a few raisins, a small 
quantity of brandy, and some cloves. The above makes a sweet 
mellow wine, but does not taste strong of the elder. 

Elder Wine. No. 3. 

Take twenty -four pounds of raisins, of whatever sort you 
please ; pick them clean, chop them small, put them into a tub, 
and cover them with three gallons of water that has been boiled 
and become cold. Let it stand ten days, stirring it twice a 
day. Then strain the liquor through a hair sieve, draining it 
all from the raisins, and put to it three pints of the juice of 
elderberries and a pound of loaf-sugar. Put the whole into the 
cask, and let it stand close stopped, but not in too cold a cellar, 
for three or four months before you bottle it. The peg-hole 
must not be stopped till it has done working. 

The best way to draw the juice from the berries is to strip 
them into an earthen pan, and set it in the oven all night. 

Elder Wine. No. 4. 

Mash eight gallons of picked elderberries to pieces, add as 
much spring water as will make the whole nine gallons, and 
boil slowly for three quarters of an hour. Squeeze them 
through a cloth sieve ; add twenty- eight pounds of moist sugar, 
and boil them together for half an hour. Run the liquor 
through your cloth sieve again ; let it stand till lukewarm ; put 
into it a toast with a little yest upon it, and let it stand for 
seven or eight days, stirring it every day. Then put it into a 
close tub, and let it remain without a bung till it has done 
hissing. Before you bung up close, you may add one pint of 
brandy at pleasure. 

Elder Wine, No. 5. 

Half a gallon of ripe berries to a gallon of water; boil it half 
an hour ; strain it tlurough a sieve. To every gallon of liquor 



WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 385 

put three pounds of sugar ; boil them together three quarters 
of an hour ; when cold, put some yest to it; work it a week, 
and put it in barrel. Let it stand a year. To half a hogshead 
put one quart of brandy and three pounds of raisins. 

Elder-flower Wine. 
To six gallons of water put eighteen pounds of lump-sugar ; 
boil it half an hour, skimming it all the time. Put into a cask 
a quarter of a peck of elder-flowers picked, clean from the 
stalks, the juice and rinds of six lemons pared very thin, and 
six pounds of raisins. When the water and sugar is about 
jnilk warm, pour it into the cask upon these ingredients ; spread 
three or four spoonfuls of yest uppn a piece of bread well 
toasted, and put it into the cask ; stir it up for three or four 
days only; when it has done working, bung it up, and in six or 
eight months it will \ie fit for bottling. 

Sham Frontiniac, 
To three gallons of water put nine pounds of good loaf- 
sugar ; boil it half an hour ; when milk- warm, add to it nearly 
a peck of elder-flowers picked clear from the stalks, the juice 
and peel of three good-sized lemons, cut very thin, three 
pounds of stoned raisins, and two or three spoonfuls of yest ; 
stir it often for four or five days. When it has quite done 
working, bung it up, and it will be fit for bottling in five days. 

Mixed Fruit Wine, 
Take currants, gooseberries, raspberries, and ^ few rose- 
leaves, three pints of fruit, mashed all together, to a quart -of 
cold water. Let it stand twenty-four hours ; then drain it 
through a sieve. To every gallon of juice put three pounds 
and a half of Lisbon sugar; let it ferment; put it into a 
cask, but do not bung it up for some time. Put in some 
brandy, and bottle it for use. 

Ginger Wine, No. 1. 
With four gallons of water boil twelve pounds of loaf-sugar 
till it becomes clear. In a separate pan boil nine ounces of 
ginger, a little bruised, in two quarts of water ; pour the whole 
into an earthen vessel, in which you must have two pounds of 
raisins shred fine, the juice and rind of ten lemons. When of 
about the warmth of new milk, put in four spoonfuls of fresh 
yest ; let it ferment two days; then put it into a cask, with all 
the ginger, lemon-peel, and raisins, and half an ounce of isin- 



386 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEUIIS, &C. 

glass dissolved in a litde of the wine ; in two or three day^s 
bung it np dose. In three months it will be fit to bpttfe* 
Pat into each bottle a little Inrandy, and some sugar also, 
if not sweet enough. 

Ging^er Wine. No. 2. 
Twenty-six quarts of vrater, eighteen pounds of white Lisbon 
sugar, six ouhces of bruised ginger, tiie peel of six lemcms 
p&red very thin : boil half an hour, and let it stand tiU no more 
than blood warm. Put it in your cask, with the juice of six 
lemons, five spoonfuls of yest, and three pounds of raisms. 
Stir it six or seven times with a stick through the bung'-hQle, 
and put in half an ounce of isinglass and a pint of good brandy. 
Close the bung, and in about six weeks it will be fit for bottle. 
Let it stand about six months before you drink it. If you like, 
it may be drawn from the cask, and it will befit for use in tfa«t 
way in about two months. 

Ginger Wine. No. 3. 
To ten gallons of water put eight pounds of loaf-sugar and 
three ounces of bruised ginger ; boil all together for one hour, 
taking the scum off as it rises ; then put it into a pan to 
cool. When it is cold, put it into a cask, with the rind and 
juice of ten lemons, one bottle of good brandy, and half a 
spoonful of yest. Bung it up for a fortnight : then bottle 
it off, and in three weeks it will be fit to drmk. The lemons 
must be pared very thin, and no part of the white must, on 
any account, be put in the cask. 

Ginger Wine. No. 4. 
To every gallon of water put one pound and a half of brown 
sugar and one ounce of bruised ginger, and to each gallon the 
white of an egg well beaten. Stir dl together, and boU it half 
an hour ; skim it well while any thing rises, and, when milk- 
warm, stir in a little yest. When cold, to every five gallons, 
put two sliced lemons. Bottle it in nine days ; and it will be 
fit to drink in a week. 

Gooseberry Wine. No. 1. 
To every pound of white amber gooseberries, when heads 
and tails are picked off and well bruised in a mortar, add a 
quart of spring vrater, which must be previously boiled. Let 
it stand till it is cold before it is put to the fruit. Let them 
steep three days, stirring them twice a day ; strain and press 



WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 387 

them through a sieve into a barrel, and to every gallon of 
liquor put three pounds of loaf-sugar, and to every five gallons 
a bottle of brandy. Hang a small bag of isinglass in the barrel; 
bung it close, and, in six months, if the sweetness is sufficiently 
gone off, bottle it, and rosin the corks well over the top. The 
fruit must be full grown, but quite green. 

Gooseberry Wine. No. 2. 

To three quarts of full grown gooseberries well crushed put 
one gallon of water well stirred together for a day or two. 
Then strain and squeeze the pulp, and put the liquor immedi- 
ately into the barrel, with three pounds and a half of common 
loaf-sugar; stir it every day until the fermentation ceases. 
Reserve two or three gallons of the liquor to fill up the barrel, 
as it overflows through the fermentation. Put a bottle of 
brandy into the cask, to season it, before the wine ; this quan- 
tity will be sufficient for nine or ten gallons. BecareM to 
let the fermentation cease, before you bung down the barrel. 

The plain white gooseberries, taken when not too ripe, but 
rather the contrary, are the best for this purpose. 

Gooseberry Wine, No. 3. 
A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit : melt the sugar, and 
bruise the gooseberries with an apple-beater, but do not beat 
them too small. Strain them through a hair strainer, and put 
the juice into an earthen pot ; keep it covered four or five days 
till it is clear : then add half a pint of the best brandy or more, 
according to the quantity of fruit, and draw it out into another 
vessel, letting it run into a hair sieve. Stop it close, and let it 
stand one fortnight longer ; then draw it off into quart bottles, 
and in a month it will be fit for drinking. 

Gooseberry Wine, No. 4. 
Proceed as directed for white currant wine, but use loaf- 
sugar. Large pearl gooseberries, not quite ripe, make excel- 
lent champagne. 

Grape Wine. 
Pick and squeeze the grapes ; strain them, and to each

388 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C. 

Lemon Wine. 
To every gallon of water pat three pounds and a half of 
loaf-sugar ; boil it half an hour, and to every ten gallons, when 
6old, put a pint of yest. Put it next day into a barrel, with the 
peels and juice of eight lemons ; you must pare them very thin, 
and run the juice through a jelly-bag. Put the rinds into a net 
with a stone in it, or it will rise to the top and spoil the wine. 
To every ten gallons add a pint of brandy. Stop up the barrel, 
and in l^ree months the wine, if fine, will be fit for bottling. 
The brandy must be put in when the wine is made. 

Sham Madeira, 
Take thirty pounds of coarse sugar to ten gallons of water ; 
boil it half an hoar ; skim it clean, and, when cool, put to every 
gallon one quart of ale, out of the vat ; let it work well in the 
tub a day or two. Then put it in the barrel, with one ponnd of 
sugar-candy, six pounds of raisins, one quart of brandy, and 
two ounces of isinglass. When it has done fermenting, bung it 
down close, and let it stand one year. 

Orange Wine, No. 1. 
Take six gallons of water to twelve pounds of lump-sugar ; 
put four whites of eggs, well beaten, into the sugar and water 
cold ; boil it three quarters of an hour, skim while boilings and 
when cold put to it six spoonfuls of yest, and six oimces of 
syrup of citron, well beaten together, and the juice and rinds 
of fifty Seville oranges, but none of the white. Let all these 
stand two days and nights covered close ; then add two quarts 
of Rhenish wine ; bung it up close. Twelve days afterwards 
bottle and cork it well. 

Orange Wine, No. 2. 
To make ten gallons of wine, pare one hundred oranges 
very thin, and put the peel into a tub. Put in a copper 
ten gallons of water, with twenty-eight pounds of common 
brown sugar, and the whites of six eggs well beaten; boil 
it for three quarters of an hour; just as it begins to boil, 
skim it, and continue to do so all the time it is boiling ; pour 
the boiling liquor on the peel : cover it well to keep in the 
steam, and, two hours afterwards, when blood warm, poor 
in the juice. Put in a toast well spread with yest to make it 
work. Stir it well, and, in five or six days, put it in your cask 
free from the peel ; it will then work five or six days longer. 
Then put in two quarts of brandy, and bung it close. Let

it remain twelve or eighteen months, and then bottle it. It 
will keep many years. 

Orange Wine. No. 8. 
To a gallon of wine pat three pounds of lump sugar ; clarify 
this with the white of an egg to every gallon. Boil it an hour, 
and when the scum rises take it off; when almost cold, dip a 
toast into yest, put it into the liquor, and let it stand all ni^t. 
Then take out tiie toast, and put in the juice of twelve oranges 
to every gallon, adding about half the peel. Run it through a 
sieve into the cask, and let it stand for several months. 

Sham Port Wine, 
Cover four bushels of blackberries with boiling hot water, 
squeeze them, and put them into a vessel to work. After 
working, draw or pour off the liquor into a cask ; add a gallon 
of brandy and a quart of port wine ; let it work again ; then 
bung it up for six months, and bottle it. 

Raisin Wine. No. 1. 

Take one hundred weight of raisins, of the Smyrna sort, and 
put them into a tub with fourteen gallons of spring water. Let 
them stand covered for twenty-one days, stirring them twice 
every day. Strain the liquor through a hair-bag from the 
raisins, which must be well pressed to get out the juice ; turn 
it into a vessel, and let it remain four months ; then bung it up 
close, and make a vent-hole, which must be frequently opened, 
and left so for a day togetiier. When it is of an agreeable 
sweetness, rack it off into a fresh cask, and put to it one gallon 
of British brandy, and, if you think it necessary, a little isin- 
glass to fine it. Let it then stand one month, and it will be 
fit to bottle; but the longer it remains in the cask the better 
it will be. 

Raisin Wine, No. 3. 

Take four gallons of water, and boit it till reduced to three, 
four pounds of raisins of the sun, and four lemons sliced very 
thin ; take off the peel of two of them ; put the lemons and 
raisins into an earthen pot, with a pound of loaf-sugar. Pour 
in your water very hot ; cover it close for a day and a night ; 
strain it through a fiannel bag ; then bottle it, and tie down 
the corks. Set it in a cold place, and it will be ready to drink 
in a month. 

Raisin Wine, No. 3. 

To one hundred pound of raisins boil eighteen gallons 
of water, and let it stand till cold,- with two oimces of hops. 



390 WINES, CORDIALS, LIQUEURS, &C.

stir it up together twice a day for a fortnight. Run it 
through a hair-sieve; squeeze the raisins well with your 
hands, and put the liquor into the barrel. Bung it up close ; 
let it stand till it is dear ; then bottle it. 

Raisin Wine, No. 4. 
Take a brandy cask, and to every gallon of water put five 
pounds of Smyrna raisins with the stidks on, and fill the cask, 
bunging it close down. Put it in a cool dry cellar ; let it stand 
six months ; then tap it with a strainer cock, and bottle it. Add 
half a pint of brandy to every gallon of wine.
