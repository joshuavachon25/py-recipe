INTRODUCTION 

Meals of many courses are neither practical nor 
popular with the modern hostess. For a company 
luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve more 
than a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or sandwich, a 
dessert and a beverage. A first course and a relish 
may be provided if desired. 

Sunday Night Suppers 

The following menus were arranged especially as 
Sunday night suppers, but they are equally suitable 
for midday luncheons or high teas. Many of the 
dishes will be found desirable for afternoon teas or 
evening spreads, and for use in tea and lunch rooms, 
and for automobile picnics. 

Preliminary Preparations 

Preparations for Sunday night suppers should be 
made on Saturday as far as possible. For a luncheon 
it is a help to have some things done the day before. 
For picnics and parties much must be done in ad- 
vance. As an aid to the hostess we have listed after 
each menu what these preliminary preparations may 
be. 

Cooking at the Table 

Many of the hot dishes may be prepared in a chaf- 
ing dish or on an electric grill. For these, much of 
the measuring may be done in advance, the ingredients 



INTRODUCTION 



being put in small dishes on a tray. Coffee and tea 
may be made at the table with electric appliances. 



Sandwiches and Biscuits 

Sandwiches may be made and wrapped first in dry 
cheesecloth, then in damp cheesecloth, and placed in a 
covered crock some hours before a meal. The hot 
biscuits may be replaced by rolls or bread and butter 
if desired. 



Automobile Picnics 

For picnics the beverages and hot dishes may be 
prepared at home and carried in thermos food jars. 
The cold dishes may be packed in a small portable 
refrigerator. The biscuits, sandwiches, cakes, and 
cookies should be carefully wrapped in wax paper 
and packed in boxes. Ice creams may be taken in 
the freezer. Hot sandwiches and bacon may be 
cooked over the coals or on a portable oil or alcohol 
stove. In some menus it may be desirable to omit or 
modify a few of the dishes, if food is to be carried 
several miles. 



Market Orders 

Supplies for use on Sunday evening should, of 
course, be purchased on Saturday. To prevent any 
mistakes in ordering we have listed under each menu 



INTRODUCTION 3 

the foodstuffs that will be required. Supplies that 
are usually kept on hand are not listed, as 

Baking powder Rock salt 

Cayenne Table salt 

Cornstarch Granulated sugar 

Bread flour Soda 

Pastry flour Spices, whole and ground 

Molasses Table sauce 

Mustard Vanilla 

Paprika Vinegar 

Pepper 



How TO Buy 

Some things are listed in the market orders that 
many people always have on hand. This is for the 
benefit of those who do not prepare all their meals 
and have little space for seldom used supplies. As 
far as feasible the amounts of material in the market 
orders are such as could be purchased. They may 
differ somewhat from the amounts called for in the 
redpes, thus leaving some foodstuff on hand. In 
many cases it may be more economical to purchase in 
larger quantities than those given. In some cases 
smaller amounts are called for than can be purchased, 
as one-half can, or one-fourth cup, in case supplies on 
hand are adequate without purchasing more than re- 
quired. Butter only is given in the market orders. 
In cooking, margarine, lard, and other shortenings 
may be used instead, if preferred. 



4 introduction 

Measurements 

In all recipes measurements are made level. Meas- 
uring cups, divided into thirds and quarters, are used, 
and tea and table measuring spoons. Cups of dry- 
material are filled to overflowing by putting the ma- 
terial into the cup with a tablespoon, and are then 
leveled off with a knife. Tea and tablespoons are 
filled heaping with dry material, and then leveled off 
with a knife. Flour should be sifted once before 
measuring. 

Recipes and Menus 

The recipes are planned to serve eight persons. 
Most of them may be divided for a smaller, party. 

The average cost of the menus is fifty cents per 
person. Some of the dishes may be made less expen- 
sive and rich by substituting milk for cream, and by 
other substitutions and omissions that will suggest 
themselves to the resourceful hostess. Many types of 
dishes are given. Many variations are possible. 

In some menus a choice of dishes is suggested. A 
few recipes are given that are not called for in the 
menus. These are usually to show how to utilize in 
a different way something for which a recipe is given 
or to use in another meal some foodstuff left from 
a recipe. 

These recipes and menus have all been tested at 
Miss Farmer's School of Cookery. The author wishes 
to express here her appreciation of the painstaking 
work of all the members of the staff of the school 
who have assisted in making this little book possible.

HOT HAM SANDWICHES 



MENU I 9 

GRAPE OR CURRANT JELLY 

Wash and pick over 

Fruit. Crush in kettle one layer at a time and boil, 
stirring frequently, until juice is extracted from 
pulp. Let drip through double piece of cheese- 
cloth, rinsed in cold water, over night or till juice 
no longer drips. Do not squeeze. To 

I tablespoon juice add 

I tablespoon alcohol ; stir and let stand lo minutes. If 
I of the mixture is cloudy use 

I cup sugar to each cup juice. If all is cloudy use 
equal parts sugar and juice. (This is called the 
Pectin Test.) Be sure that juice mixed with al- 
cohol is discarded immediately. Measure remain- 
ing juice into kettle, bring to boiling point, add 
required amount of sugar and cook to 220 degrees 
F. or until mixture will show two distinct, firm 
drops when dripped from side of spoon, or when 
small amount will become firm when dropped on 
very cold saucer. Then skim and pour into 
sterilized glasses. 

Second Extraction 
Return fruit pulp to kettle, add barely enough cold 
water to cover it, bring slowly to boiling point, 
stirring to prevent burning on; cook 5 minutes, 
drain and finish as for first extraction, boiling 5 
minutes before adding the sugar. 

Third Extraction 
Proceed as for second extraction. Oftentimes the 
juice from second and third extractions may be

combined before being made up into jelly. By 
making three extractions the amount of jelly ob- 
tainable from a given amount of fruit may be 
almost doubled.

4 tomatoes in halves in such a way that they come 

apart in points. Arrange each half in a nest of 
Lettuce leaves. In the center of tomato pile 
Cream cheese forced through a coarse strainer. In

cook, beating constantly with egg beater for 7 to 
12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape.

will cover 3 dozen small crackers. Should frosting 
be too soft to hold its shape after adding marsh- 
mallow cream, it may be again placed over hot 
water, and folded gently over and over, until it 
becomes slightly granular around the edges. Re- 
move from hot water, and continue folding over 
gently until of the desired stiffness.

INTRODUCTION 

Meals of many courses are neither practical nor 
popular with the modern hostess. For a company 
luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve more 
than a first course, a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or 
sandwich, a dessert and a beverage. A relish is de- 
sirable with the main course. The first course and 
relish may be omitted if desired. 

SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPERS 

The following menus were arranged especially as 
Sunday night suppers, but they are equally suitable for 
midday luncheons or high teas. Many of the dishes 
will be found desirable for afternoon teas or evening 
spreads, for use in tea and lunch rooms, and for 
automobile picnics. 

PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS 

Preparations for Sunday night suppers should be 
made on Saturday as far as possible. For a luncheon 
it is a help to have some things done the day before. 
For picnics and parties much must be done in advance. 
As an aid to the hostess we have listed after each 
menu what these preliminary preparations may be. 

COOKING AT THE TABLE 

Many of the hot dishes may be prepared in a chafing 
dish or on an electric grill. For these, much of the 
measuring may be done in advance, the ingredients 



2 INTRODUCTION 

being put in small dishes on a tray. Coffee and tea 
may be made at the table with electric appliances. 



SANDWICHES AND BISCUITS 

Bread for sandwiches can be cut in thinner slices 
if wrapped in wax paper and chilled in the refrigerator 
over-night. Sandwiches may be made and wrapped 
in wax paper and placed in a covered container in the 
refrigerator some hours before a meal. The hot bis- 
cuits may be replaced by rolls or bread and butter if 
desired. 

AUTOMOBILE PICNICS 

For picnics the beverages and hot dishes may be 
prepared at home and carried in thermos food jars. 
The cold dishes may be packed in a small portable re- 
frigerator. The biscuits, sandwiches, cakes and cookies 
should be carefully wrapped in wax paper and packed 
in boxes. Ice creams may be taken in the freezer or 
packed in dry ice. Hot sandwiches and bacon may 
be cooked at an out-door fireplace. In some menus it 
may be desirable to omit or modify a few of the dishes, 
if food is to be carried several miles. 

MARKET ORDERS 

Supplies for use on Sunday evening should, of 
course, be purchased on Saturday. To prevent any 
mistakes in ordering we have listed under each menu 
the foodstuffs that will be required. Supplies that are 
usually kept on hand are not listed, as 



INTRODUCTION 3 

Baking powder Paprika 

Cayenne Pepper 

Cocoa Table salt 

Coffee Granulated sugar 

Cornstarch Soda 

Cream of tartar Spices, whole and ground 

Bread flour Table sauce 

Pastry flour Tea 

Molasses Vanilla 

Mustard Vinegar 



HOW TO BUY 

Some things are listed in the market orders that 
many people always have on hand. This is for the 
benefit of those who do not prepare all their meals and 
have little space for seldom-used supplies. As far as 
feasible the amounts of material in the market orders 
are such as could be purchased. They may differ 
somewhat from the amounts called for in the recipes, 
thus leaving some foodstuff on hand. In many cases 
it may be more economical to purchase in larger quan- 
tities than those given. In some cases smaller amounts 
are called for than can be purchased, as one-half can, 
or one-fourth cup, as supplies on hand may be adequate 
without purchasing more than is required. Butter only 
is given in the market orders. In cooking, margarine, 
lard, and other shortenings may be used instead, if 
preferred. Many things like mayonnaise, marmalade, 
pickles, soups, etc., may be purchased ready to use in- 
stead of being prepared at home. 



4 INTRODUCTION 

MEASUREMENTS 

In all recipes measurements are made level. Meas- 
uring cups, divided into thirds and quarters, are used, 
and tea and table measuring spoons. Cups of dry ma- 
terial are filled to overflowing by putting the material 
into the cup with a tablespoon, and are then leveled 
off with a knife. Measuring spoons are filled heaping 
with dry material, and then leveled off with a knife. 
Flour should be sifted once before measuring. 

RECIPES AND MENUS 

The recipes are planned to serve eight persons. 
Most of them may be divided for a smaller party. 

The average cost of the menus is less than fifty cents 
per person. Some of the dishes may be made less 
expensive and rich by substituting whole or evaporated 
milk for cream, and by other substitutions and omis- 
sions that will suggest themselves to the resourceful 
hostess. Many types of dishes are given. Many 
variations are possible. 

In some menus a choice of dishes is suggested. A 
few recipes are given that are not called for in the 
menus. These are usually to show how to utilize in a 
different way something for which a recipe is given or 
to use in another meal some foodstuff left from a recipe. 

These recipes and menus have all been tested, re- 
vised and modernized at Miss Farmer's School of 
Cookery. The author wishes to express here her ap- 
preciation of the painstaking work of all the members 
of the staff of the school who have assisted in making 
this little book possible.

HOT HAM SANDWICHES 



MENU I 9 

Grape or Currant Jelly 

Wash and pick over 

Fruit. Crush in kettle one layer at a time and boil, 
stirring frequently, until juice is extracted from 
pulp. Let drip through double piece of cheesecloth, 
rinsed in cold water, until juice no longer drips. 
Do not squeeze. To 

i tablespoon juice add 

i tablespoon alcohol, stir and let stand 10 minutes. If 
§ of the mixture is cloudy use 

§ cup sugar to each cup juice. If all is cloudy use 
equal parts sugar and juice. (This is called the 
Pectin Test.) Be sure that juice mixed with alco- 
hol is discarded immediately. Measure remaining 
juice into kettle, bring to boiling point, add required 
amount of sugar and cook to 220 ° F. or until mix- 
ture will show two distinct, firm drops when dripped 
from side of spoon, or when small amount will be- 
come firm when dropped on very cold saucer. Then 
skim and pour into sterilized glasses. 

Second Extraction 

Return fruit pulp to kettle, add enough cold water 
barely to cover it and bring slowly to boiling point, 
stirring to prevent burning. Cook 5 minutes, drain 
and finish as for first extraction, boiling 5 minutes 
before adding the sugar. 

Third Extraction 

Proceed as for second extraction. Oftentimes the 
juice from second and third extractions may be 



io FOR LUNCHEON AND SUPPER GUESTS 

combined before being made up into jelly. By 
making three extractions the amount of jelly ob- 
tainable from a given amount of fruit may be al- 
most doubled. 



Tomato Salad with Cheese Dressing 

Cut 
4 tomatoes in halves in points. Arrange each half in 

a nest of 
Lettuce leaves. In the center of tomato pile 
Cream cheese forced through a coarse strainer. In 

center of cheese put a few bits of 
Green pepper chopped fine. Serve with 
Cheese Dressing.

Mix 
2 tablespoons mayonnaise with 
2 tablespoons cream cheese. Add 
\ teaspoon salt 



MENU I ii 

■£ teaspoon table sauce 

£ teaspoon paprika and add very slowly 

^ cup salad oil, beating with egg beater until very 

thick. Add slowly 
i£ tablespoons vinegar. Keep in cool place till ready

Cocoa Ice Cream 

Scald 
2 cups milk. Sift 
•£ cup dry powdered cocoa and mix very thoroughly 

with 
Few grains salt 
i cup sugar and 

1 tablespoon cornstarch and add to the milk. Cook

until thickened, and occasionally afterward. Pour 
over 

2 egg yolks well beaten, cool and add 
2 egg whites beaten stiff 

2 cups cream beaten stiff 

1 teaspoon vanilla and 

1 cup syrup drained from canned raspberries or straw- 
berries and freeze. If frozen in a mechanical re- 
frigerator, put mixture in freezing tray, set to freeze 
quickly and stir and beat when partly frozen. Then 
finish freezing and set regulator at normal. If 
frozen in ice cream freezer, do not beat the cream. 



12 FOR LUNCHEON AND SUPPER GUESTS 

Put mixture in can of freezer and surround with 
three parts ice and one part salt. Let mixture stand 
5 minutes, then turn crank slowly until mixture is

Fig Marguerites 

Put in top of double boiler 

J cup sugar 

3 tablespoons water 

i tablespoon corn syrup and 

i teaspoon cream of tartar. Stir until sugar is dis- 
solved and wash down sugar crystals from inside 
of double boiler with pastry brush dipped in cold 
water. Ada 

i egg white, unbeaten. Place over hot water and 
cook, beating constantly with egg beater for 7 to 
12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape. 
Add 

1 heaping tablespoon marshmallow cream and 

J teaspoon vanilla and fold over and over until again

J cup (3) figs cut in small pieces and 

% cup nut meats cut in small pieces. Pile on 

Small round crackers and bake at 375 ° F. for 10 min- 
utes or until delicately brown. This amount will 
cover 3 dozen small crackers. Should frosting be 
too soft to hold its shape after adding marshmallow 
cream, it may be again placed over hot water and 
folded gently over and over until it becomes slightly 
granular around the edges. Remove from hot 



MENU I 13 

water and continue folding over gently until of the 
desired stiffness.

as a cake filling or frosting. It need not be baked.
