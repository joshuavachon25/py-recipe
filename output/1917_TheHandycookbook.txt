40 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 



"GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD" 

In every house, great or small, the dining room should be as bright, 
cosy and cheerful as possible, for "MAN MUST EAT," and the plainest room 
may be made beautiful by taste, and the homeliest fare appetizing by neat- 
ness and skill. 

The table should be first covered with a pad or "silence" cloth, and 
under this an asbestos cover may be used to protect a highly polished table- 

The cloth neatly laid, then place the center-piece of lace or embroidery, 
and upon it always a few flowers, dish of ferns or fruit arranged with green 
leaves. 

The plates should be placed to allow each person twenty inches of space. 

At the right of the service plate lay the knives, sharp edge toward the 
plate; next the soup spoon, then the oyster fork. 

At the left of the plate lay the forks and spoons necessary for all the 
courses, then the napkin. 

The glass of water should be at the right, the small bread and butter 
plate at the left. 

A few courses well served is considered better taste than a great number. 

A sensible menu for dinner is soup, fish with one vegetable, a roast with 
one or two vegetables, and a salad and cheese, and simple dessert. 

The most attractive arrangement for luncheon or tea, if one possesses 
a nice table, is to dispense with the cloth and use only center-piece and doilies 
on the polished surface. 

A medium sized doilie is required for each plate; a tiny one for each 
glass, and one for each dish served from the table. Asbestos mats should 
be used under doilies to protect table from the heat. 

Nothing adds more to the beauty of the dinner table than the garnish- 
ment of dishes. A great variety of things are suitable for the garnishment 
of meats, fish and salads; as hard boiled eggs, beets cut in fancy shapes, 
sliced tomatoes, parsley, water cress, celery, lettuce, olives, slices of lemon, 
nasturtium leaves and blossom. 

"Let no one suppose that because she lives in a small house, and dines 
on homely fare, that the general principles here laid down do not apply to 
her. A small house is more easily kept clean than a palace; taste may be 
quite as well displayed in the arrangement of dishes on a pine table as in 
grouping the silver and china of the rich. Skill in cooking is as readily shown 
in a baked potato or a Johnny-cake as in canvas-back duck. The charm 
of good house-keeping lies in a nice attention to little things, not in a super- 
abundance, 'Bad dinners go hand in hand with total depravity; while a 
properly fed man is already half saved. ' " 



42 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

A family may subsist a lifetime without pie, pickles or pudding; they 
may be careless of cake, cookies or creams; but good bread they must have, 
for "Bread is the staff of life." 

BREAD 

To produce the best results good materials should be used. The yeast should be 
fresh and sweet, and as little used as possible, as too much gives a disagreeable yeasty 
smell and makes a course bread. Compressed yeast is best, but where not obtainable, 
any good home-made yeast may be used. 

Bread and rolls should rise in a moderately warm place. If in too cold a place 
it will be heavy, and if in too hot, sour. In the case of soured dough, a teaspoon of soda 
will correct the sourness of the dough, but will not bring back the sweetness of the flour. 
Bread should rise to twice its original size before it is ready to bake, and small loaves 
are always preferable to large ones. 

Rolls and all baking-powder bread require a hotter oven than a yeast-raised bread. 
In using baking powder always sift it twice with the flour. A teaspoon of baking powder 
to each pint of flour is a good proportion. 

YEAST 

Put on stove and let come to a boil, 1 qt. of buttermilk; pour this over 
2 qts. of corn meal, stirring as you do so. Let cool until just lukewarm, 
then add 1 pt. of soaked yeast. If you have no home-made yeast to start 
with, use 3 cakes of yeast foam. Make in the evening and let rise over night. 
In the morning drop in small pieces on a cloth to dry. 

GOOD BREAD 

Cook 4 potatoes in 3 pints of water till good and done, then pour potatoes 
and water in a colander, add enough water to make enough for your sponge, 
then add Yi cup sugar, 2 tablespoons of salt and Yi cup yeast. Let stand 
till morning, then stir in flour, it will be ready to mix in an hour if kept warm, 
then knead well and set away to rise as usual. 

SALT RISING BREAD 

Boil Yi pt- of new milk and stir into it enough corn meal to make a 
stiff mush. Set in a warm place to rise over night. The next morning add 
tD this 1 pt. of tepid water, a pinch of salt and flour enough to drop from a 
spoon. Pour this into a jar and cover it. Set in a pot of warm water and 
keep the water the same temperature. Let remain until dough rises enough, 
then mix with 6 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of lard. Mix to a stiff dough. 
Make into loaves. When it rises bake in a moderate oven. 

BUNS 

One cup sponge, 1-2 cup lard, 3^ cup sugar, 1 cup warm water. Thicke" 
with flour and let rise. Make out in small biscuits, let rise and bake. 

BUNS 

At night take 3 large teacups of new milk, let scald, add 1 cup of lard, 

1 scant cup of sugar. When cold stir in flour to make a stiff batter and add 

2 yeast cakes that have been well soaked. Set in a warm place until morning. 
Mix flour enough to make a soft dough. Salt. Let rise and knead the 
second time. Then roll out the thickness of common biscuit, cut with dull 
edge of cup or glass and put in pans about 2 inches apart. Bake a light 
brown and grease with butter when done.

46 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

MEAT 

In purchasing beef, select that with a moderate amount of cream-colored fat; avoid 
the dark, yellow fat; it bespeaks an old animal. The lean should be lightly mottled 
with fat, and the flesh should be firm and of a good, dark red color. Never wash beef; 
scrape the outside, if necessary, or it may be wiped with a damp cloth, but never put 
in water, nor put directly on the ice, but put in the lower part of the refrigerator or in 
a cool place. Never salt meat before it is cooked; wait until it is partly done. 

All meats should be cooked quickly at first to retain the juices. Boiled meat should 
be put in boiling water, baked meat in a very hot oven, and panned or broiled meat in 
a hot pan; then they may be cooked more slowly after the outside is seared. 

Of the most desirable methods of cooking beef, perhaps broiling or grilling is best, 
as it preserves the juices and develops the flavor. Roasted beef, that done before the 
fire, is excellent. It is said boiled meat is more easily digested than either baked or 
roasted meats, on account of the overheating of the fat in the oven. Baking, however, 
develops the greatest flavor. Tender meats are best broiled, roasted or stewed. 

VEAL BIRDS 

For 6 birds, get iy2 lbs, veal on the round, cut in pieces about 3 inches 
square. Make a dressing of 2 cups of fine dry bread crumbs seasoned with 
salt and pepper, butter 1 tablespoon, and a little onion; moisten with hot 
water and mix in 1 well beaten egg. Divide the dressing, placing equal 
amounts on each piece of veal. Draw the edges of the veal together and 
fasten with toothpicks. Dip each bird in beaten egg and roll in cracker 
crumbs and cook in a kettle of hot lard until browned nicely. Serve hot on 
platter garnished with parsley. 

BOILING 

All meats should be gently boi'el rather than boiled fast in order to 
be tender. The water should never be allowed to stop boiling before the 
article is done. The kettle should be kept covered, merely raising the cover 
to remove the scum. Always add boiling water if any is needed. Cold 
water will ruin the flavor. 

POT ROAST 

Brown meat in kettle with lard to prevent burning. Pour in boiling 
water to half cover it. Add several cloves, sticking in the meat, one-half 
of a small red pepper and add salt. Use the first cut off of the rump. 

POT ROAST 

Heat a skillet very hot, grease slightly, and brown roast quickly on all 
sides. Then put into kettle with boiling water, cook slowly until tender. 
Season when about half done. Thicken liquor in kettle for brown gravy. 
This is excellent far either beef or pork. 

BEEF STEAK BROILED 

Have steak cut 1 inch thick, put in red-hot skillet, sear well, turning 
constantly until brown. Then add suet, cover and cook rather slowly for 
twenty or thirty minutes. Season with salt and pepper, take up meat, put 
very little water in skillet and pour over meat. 

HOLLAND STEAK 

Remove all bone, fat and stringy portions from steak; salt, pepper and 
flavor well. Heat skillet very hot; put in butter and but one or two pieces 
of steak, constantly pricking with a fork and moving about and turning 
frequently that juices may not escape; add more butter as needed. The 
skillet must be kept very hot. When steak is cooked add more butter, let 
brown, pour in a little water and pour around steak. 



THE HANDY COOK BOOK 47 

BEEF STEAK SMOTHERED IN ONIONS 

Slice the onions thin and drop in water. Put steak in pan with a little 
suet. Skim out onions and add to steak, season with pepper and salt, 
cover tightly and put over the fire ; when meat is browned on one side remove 
onions, turn steak, replace onions and fry until done. 

HAMBURG STEAK 

Take a good round steak, grind it fine. Have skillet very hot, as for 
broiling. Stir in the meat and cook until done. Add a liberal lump of butter. 
Salt and pepper to taste. If more gravy is liked add a little water. Serve 
hot. 

BREADED STEAK 

Have the butcher hack well a piece of flank steak. Dip in well beaten 
egg, season with salt and pepper, roll in cracker crumbs. Fry in piping

SAUCES for MEATS, FISH, VEGETABLES 

The juices that flow from rare cooked meats are the best sauce for them; but do 
not try to make them go farther by pouring hot water over the meat as is it carved. A 
steak cooked to a turn needs only salt; it may have butter if it has but little fat; lamb 
chops need only salt, but many like to add a little lemon juice, or minced parsley, or tomato 
sauce, to both meats, and also to many other broiled meats, like chicken, tripe, etc. 
Apple sauce should be served with pork, duck and goose; cranberry sauce seems to belong 
to turkey and roast chicken. Oily fish broiled needs but little butter, but salt and lemon 
juice may be used generously. White fish, like halibut, cod, etc., needs rich white sauce 
flavored with egg, lemon and onion. 

There is a common philosophy in making sauces. Remember that two level table- 
spoons of butter or lard mixed with two level tablespoons of flour will thicken each 
half-pint of liquid. 

For a white sauce rub the fat and flour together and add a half-pint of milk; stir 
until boiling. 

For a tomato sauce rub the fat and flour together and add a half-pint of nicely 
seasoned strained tomatoes. 

For a brown sauce, use half a pint of stock. 

For English drawn butter, rub the fat and flour together and add a half pint of 
boiling water; stir until boiling, then add a seasoning of salt and pepper and stir in, at 
least, an extra tablespoon of butter. 

The seasonings, of course, will vary, but each sauce will require a saltspoon of pepper 
and half-teaspoon of salt. By remembering the proportions one may make a dozen 
sauces in a very few minutes and have them all smooth and palatable.

POULTRY AND GAME 

CHICKEN PIE 

Take one good sized chicken, boil until tender, remove all bones and cut 
up in rather small pieces. Take the liquid left from boiling chicken and make 
into a rich dressing. Season with salt, pepper and butter, add cream or 
milk and thicken with a little flour. There must be IJ^ pints of dressing. 
Line a 2-qt. baking dish with pastry; put in the chicken, pour over one-half 
of the dressing, cover over top with pastry. Cut a slip in the top for steam 
to escape. 

Pastry: One quart of flour, 1 heaping cup of butter and lard mixed, 
one-half teaspoon of baking powder sifted with flour; mix with sweet milk. 

CfflCKEN PIE 

Make a good biscuit dough. Cut up a young chicken in small pieces. 
Line the sides of the pan with dough thin as pie crust. Put a part of the 
chicken in pan, season with butter, salt and pepper. Lay thin strips or 
squares of dough, then chicken. Season again and fill with cold water. 
Add top crust and bake 13-2 hours. Delightful. 

CfflCKEN PIE 

Stew chicken until tender. Line a deep pan with nice pastry; pour 
in chicken and the liquid it is cooked in (which should not be more than a 
pint), season with salt, pepper and a large tablespoon of butter. Cover with 
crust and bake. While this is baking, put on the fire 3^^ pint cream and 
liquid from 1 can of oysters and let it come to a boil. Season with salt and 
pepper. Pour this boiling hot over the oysters and just before the pie is 
done baking, lift the crust and add oysters, then finish baking. 

CfflCKEN PATE 

Two chickens boiled tender. Remove bones and skin and chop fine. 
Season with salt, butter and pepper. Add broth to make it moist, and press 
into a mold. Serve cold. 

CfflCKEN CROQUETTES 

One boiled chicken, Yi pound stale bread, 4 eggs, 1 can mushrooms, 
3^ pound of butter. Put the chicken and mushrooms through a croquette 
grinder. Soak the stale bread in a little chicken broth and add it to the 
meat and mushrooms, then add the butter and eggs. Mix well together and 
boil until well cooked. Season with salt, pepper, celery salt, chopped parsley, 
and a little finely chopped onion, and a very little nutmeg. Pour out on a 
platter and when cold shape, roll in bread crumbs, place in a frying basket 
and fry in boiling fat. 

CfflCKEN CROQUETTES 

Two cups finely chopped chicken, 2 cups sifted bread crumbs, 1 cup 
stock or gravy, 2 eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Heat all together and stir 
into the beaten eggs. When cold form into croquettes, dip in egg, roll in 
crumbs and fry in deep boiling lard. 



54 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 



BROILED CHICKEN 

Split young chicken open in back and take out breast bone. Wipe 
chicken dry, and cook on hot griddle. Place a weight on cover. After it 
sears on both sides cook slower, turn often. Season with salt, butter and 
pepper when done. 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

Split young chicken down the back, wash and wipe dry, season with 
salt, pepper and bits of butter. Put in a dripping pan or roaster, skin side 
up, with very little water. Make a paste of two tablespoons of butter and 
flour well worked together with a fork spread over the chicken. Place a 
pan over it and bake in a moderate oven ^/i of an hour. 



CREAMED CHICKEN 

When a chicken is over large to fry, dress it nicely and cut it up as for 
frying. Dredge it with flour, salt and pepper to taste. Put in a roasting 
pan and put over it a cup of good cream. Put on the roaster cover and cook 
in oven until well done. This is excellent. 



SAGE AND ONION STUFFING 

(For Chicken, Duck or Pork.) 

Four large onions, 10 sage leaves, 1 qt. or 1 lb. bread crumbs, 1)4. oz. 
butter, 1 egg, salt and pepper to taste. Boil the onions 5 minutes and just 
before taking out, throw in the sage leaves for a minute or two. Chop both 
very fine, add the bread, seasoning and butter. Work all together with the 
yolk of an egg. Should be highly seasoned. When this is used for fowls, 
chop the liver and add to it. 



CHICKEN — MARYLAND STYLE 

Cut up a chicken, season, and roll in flour as for frying. Melt 3 table- 
spoons butter in roasting pan on top of stove, lay in chicken, add 1 pint 
boiling water, cover and put in oven. When brown on one side turn and 
add more water if necessary. Cook from 1 to 2 hours, according to age of 
chicken. A fowl too old to fry may be cooked in this way. The gravy 
will be most delicious, but may require a little thickening. 



WILD DUCK 

Split duck open on the back and cook same as Maryland chicken. 

QUAIL ON TOAST 

Dry pick and singe them with paper, cut off heads and legs at first 
joint, draw, split down the back, soak in salt water 10 minutes, drain and dry 
in cloth. Fry in butter and lard mixed. Serve on toast with a spoonful of

THE HANDY COOK BOOK 55 



ROAST TURKEY 

Select a good, plump fowl. Have it nicely dressed the day before 
cooking. Run inside and out with salt and pepper, place in a roasting pan 
with bits of butter and sufficient hot water to baste. It will require from 
31-2 to 4 hours to cook a 12-pound turkey. About 1 hour before taking from 
oven add the dressing made as follows: Take 2 qts. bread crumbs, soften 
with liquid from turkey, add 2 eggs, salt, pepper and sage. Mash fine with 
potato masher. Bake in pan with turkey until brown. 

PRESSED CHICKEN 

Clean and cut up your chickens. Stew in just enough water to cover 
them. When nearly cooked season them well with salt and pepper; a little 
celery if desired. Let them stew down until the water is nearly all boiled 
out and the meat drops easily from the bones. Remove the bones and gristle ; 
chop the meat rather coarsely, then turn back into the stew kettle, where the 
broth was left (after skimming off all fat), and let it heat through again. 
Turn it into saucepan, placing a plate on the top and a heavy weight on the 
plate. This, if properly prepared, will turn out like a mold of jelly and 
may be sliced in smooth, even slices. The success of this depends upon not 
having too much water; it will not jelly if too weak, or if the water is allowed 
to boil away entirely while cooking. A good way to cook old fowls. 

FRICASSE CHICKEN 

Place 1 qt. tomatoes in skillet. Cut chicken in pieces, roll in flour, 
sprinkle Hungaria Paprika on each piece, salt. Put in skillet of tomatoes, 
cover. Let simmer slowly, turn. 



THE HANDY COOK BOOK 57 

FISH AND OYSTERS 

FISH AND SHELL FISH 

Salt mackerel and other small salt fish should be broiled. Small pan fish and steaks 
of large white dry fish are good fried. Fresh salmon, mackerel and bluefish are oily 
fish and should not be fried. Boil oily fish if large — broil them if small. Cod, haddock, 
bluefish, small salmon, bass and shad may be stuffed and baked whole. 

FRIED FISH 

Clean thoroughly, cut off the head, and if large, cut out the backbone 
and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces; dip in Indian meal or 
wheat flour, or in a beaten egg, and then in bread crumbs (trout and perch 
should never be dipped in meal), put into a thick-bottomed skillet, skin 
side uppermost, with hot lard or drippings (never in butter, as it takes out 
the sweetness and gives a bad color), fry slowly and turn when a light brown. 
The roe and the backbone, if previously removed, may be cut up and fried 
with the other pieces. A better way is to dredge the pieces in flour, brush 
with beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard or drippings enough 
to completely cover them. If the fat is very hot, the fish will not absorb 
it, and will be delicately cooked. When brown on one side, turn over in 
the fat and brown the other, and when done let them drain. Slices of large 
fish may be cooked in the same way. Serve with tomato sauce or slices 
of lemon. 

BROILED WHITE FISH 

Clean, split down the back, and let stand in salt water for several 
hours; wipe dry and place on a well-greased gridiron over hot coals, sprinkling 
with salt and pepper. Put flesh side down at first, and when nicely browned, 
turn carefully on the other. Cook for twenty or thirty minutes, or until 
nicely browned on both sides. 

BAKED FISH 

Clean, rinse and wipe dry a white fish, or any fish weighing 3 or 4 
pounds. Rub the fish inside and out with salt and pepper, fill wit'i a stuff- 
ing made as that for poultry, but drier. Sew it up and put in a hot pan with 
some drippings and a lump of butter, dredge with flour, and lav over the fish 
a few thin slices of salt pork or bits of butter, and bake 1^2 hours, basting 
occasionally. 

CODFISH BALLS 

One cup codfish, 2 eggs, 1 cup cracker crumbs, 1 cup mashed potatoes. 
Mash codfish very smooth, add the potatoes and 1 egg well beaten, mix 
thoroughly. Form into small balls. Roll in flour, then in egg, then cracker 
crumbs, and fry in deep fat. Drain, pile on a platter in a pyramid, garnish 
with fried potatoes and parsley and serve. This will serve five persons. 

DECILIOUS OYSTERS 

Into 1 pint or more of oysters, turn 1 cup of milk; thicken with bread 
or cracker crumbs, add salt and pepper to taste, turn them into a frying 
pan containing a good supply of butter melted, add 2 beaten eggs turned 
over the top, cover and cook slowly. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Drain large oysters on a cloth, season with salt and pepper, roll in 
cracker dust, dip in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs, let dry. Fry in 
deep fat (butter and lard mixed is best); lay on brown paper to absorb 
grease; place on a hot platter and serve at once.

hot lard and butter. 



60 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

SOUP 

For a family in moderate circumstances, or the woman who does all the work of the 
house, it is unwise to have soup every day, for it makes unnecessary labor in changing 
for so many courses, and compels some one to look out that the next course is served 
hot. Better utilize the usual soup material in a stew, or some kind of made-over dish, 
which may be served as the chief dish of the meal. When dinner is served at nocn, 
broths and soups may be served at the supper, giving the warmth and stimulation often 
desired. 

TOMATO SOUP 

Boil 1 pt. water, 1 pt. tomatoes, level teasDoon salt, pinch pepper, slice 
onion. Cream rounded tablespoon butter with 2 tablespoons flour. Add 
to above. Again bring to boil.

After boiling a soup bone or piece of beef until done, add to the broth 
boiling water to make the amount of soup wanted, and when boiling again 
add a large handful of cabbage cut fine as for slaw, a half-pint of tomatoes, 
canned or fresh; peel and slice and add 3 large or 4 small onions and 2 or 
3 potatoes (some use a half-teacup of dried or half-pint of green corn; if 
dried corn is used, it should be soaked). Let boil from y^ to % of an hour; 
if you like a little thickening, stir an egg or yolk with a large spoonful of milk 
and a teaspoon of flour; put in 5 or 10 minutes before taking off; this makes 
it very rich. Serve with crackers. 

VEGETABLE SOUP 

Three onions, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 1 small cabbage, 1 pint tomatoes; 
chop all the vegetables except the tomatoes very fine. Have ready in por- 
celain kettle 3 quarts cf boiling water; put in all except cabbage and tomatoes 
and s^'mmer for half an hoir, then add the chopped cabbage and tomatoes 
(the tomatoes previously stewed), also a bunch of sweet herbs. Let soup 
boil for 20 minutes, strain through sieve, rubbing all the vegetables through. 
Take 2 tablespoons of best butter and 1 of flour and beat to a cream. Now 
pepper and salt soup to taste, and add a teaspoon of white sugar, a half-cup 
cf sweet cream if you have it, and last stir in the butter and flour; let it 
boil up and it is ready for the table. Serve with fried bread chips or poached 
eggs, one in dish.

pint of water; drain through a colander into a soup kettle, and when it boils, 
skim; add pepper, then the oysters; season with butter and salt, then add 1 
quart rich new milk brought to boiling point in tin pail set in a pot of boiling 
water; let boil up and serve at once. Or, instead of adding the milk, place 
it, boiling hot, in tureen, pour the soup over it, and then serve. 

CfflCKEN BROTH 

Skim and take fat off chicken, cut up as for frying, add quart of cold 
water, cook 2 hours in double boiler. Salt and pepper to taste.

as much sifted flour as it will absorb, with a little salt; roll out as thin as a 
wafer, dredge very lightly with flour, roll over and over into a large roll, 
slice from the ends, shake out the strips loosely and drop into the soup. 



THE HANDY COOK BOOK 63 

VEGETABLES 

Meats carefully cooked are, no doubt, more easily digested than some vegetables, 
but on the other hand, vegetables are clean and wholesome. Vegetable foods are con- 
centrated and slow of digestion; hence the vegetarian eats but two meals a day, and on 
these two meals, if his diet is well selected, he receives more nourishment than the meat 
eater from his three meals a day. In selecting a vegetarian diet, choose nitrogenous 
vegetables to take the place of meat; with a meat diet select green and starchy vegetables 
to fill in the vacancies of a nitrogenous diet. With beef we serve potatoes. With 
poultry, rice, or (in chestnut season) boiled chestnuts or macaroni, or hominy or white 
bread. 

All green vegetables are put on to cook in boiling water. Add salt to the water in 
which green or top ground vegetables are cooked; white or underground vegetables are 
better when the salt is added after the cooking. Wash rice through one or two waters 
before boiling. 

Soak dried fruits over night. 

Cabbage, couliflower, onions and turnips, vegetables containing volatile oil, must 
be boiled rapidly in an uncovered vessel, or they will emit unpleasant odors. 

Medium sized onions should be boiled in salt water one hour. 

Green corn in salted water five minutes. 

Peas in salted water twenty minutes. 

Asparagus in salted water thirty minutes. 

Whole head of cabbage in salted water one and a half hours. 

Chopped cabbage in salted water twenty minutes. 

Cauliflower in salted water thirty minutes. 

Carrots, turnips and the roots of plants in unsalted water one hour. If they are cut 
in dice, twenty minutes. 

Young lima beans in salted water forty minutes. 

Young beets in unsalted water thirty minutes. Old beets two to three hours. 

Potatoes in unsalted water until you can pierce them with a fork. 

Spinach and greens in unsalted water fifteen to twenty minutes. 

BOILED DINNER 

Put meat on, after washing well, in enough boiling water to just cover 
the meat; as soon as it boils, set kettle on the stove where it will simmer 
or boil very slowly; boil until almost tender. Put in vegetables in the 
following order: Cabbage cut in quarters, turnips of medium size cut in 
halves, and potatoes whole, or if large cut in two; peel potatoes and turnips, 
and allow to lie in cold water for half an hour before using. The meat 
should be well skimmed before adding vegetables, when there should be left 
only just enough water to prevent burning; take up vegetables in seuarate 
dish, and lastly the meat. If there is any juice in kettle, pour over cabbage. 

PARSNIPS 

Wash and scrape nicely and split lengthwise. Cook in salted water 
until tender. Have a skillet ready with very hot meat fryings or butter. 
Season with pepper, salt and a little sugar and fry a delicate brown. 

WINTER SQUASH 

Cut up, take out inside, pare the pieces and stew in as little water as 
possible; cook an hour, mash in kettle, and if watery, let stand on the fire 
a few moments, stirring until dry; season with sugar, butter, cream, salt and 
pepper. Be careful that it does not burn. Winter squashes are also cooked 



64 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

by cutting in pieces without paring, baking and serving like potatoes; or 
they may be cooked in a steamer, and served either in the shell, or scraped 
out, put in pan, mashed, and seasoned with butter, sugar, cream, salt and 
pepper, and then made hot and served. 

DICED TURNIPS 

Pare, slice, cut in dice an inch square, boil till nearly done in as little 
water as possible. To 1 quart of turnips, add 1 tablespoon sugar, salt to

PICKLES AND CATSUP 

In making pickles, use none but the best cider vinegar, and boil in a porcelain kettle 
— never in metal. A lump of alum size of a small nutmeg, to a gallon of cucumbers, 
dissolved and added to the vinegar when scalding the pickles the first time, renders them 
crisp and tender, but too much is injurious. Keep in a dry, cool cellar, in glass or stone- 
ware; look at them frequently and remove all soft ones; if white specks appear in the 
vinegar, drain off and scald, adding a liberal handful of sugar to each gallon, and pour 
again over the pickles; bits of horseradish and a few cloves assist in preserving the life 
of the vinegar.

by boiling over the syrup and adding spices and vinegar. Examine fre- 
quentlv, and re-scald the syrup if there are signs of fermentation. Plums

PASTRY 

PIES AND PASTRY 

Pies have been greatly abused, but it is their abuse rather than their use which 
should be condemned. When properly made and eaten at suitable times and in modera- 
tion, they are no more indigestible for a normal person than are many other foods which 
so far have escaped this unjust criticism. 

The best results are obtained when all the ingredients in the mixing of the pastry 
are exceedingly cold. 

PUFF PASTE 

One cup flour, 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons ice water. Chop 
butter into flour until butter is about the size of peas. Make a well in flour, 
add water gradually; roll from you with rolling pin, then with wide knife 
fold dough over toward you, repeating process till comparatively dry mix- 
ture is blended. After last folding press together to keep from breaking, then 
roll into shape for pie. This dough may be placed on deep round cake tin 
turned upside down, as a deep crust is desirable for pies with meringue. 

PIE CRUST 

Three cups flour, 1 cup lard, or half butter and half lard, 1 teaspoon 
salt. Mix thoroughly, add 1 cup cold water to make a paste. Roll out, 
handling as little as possible. This amount miakes four covered pies. 

PLUM COBBLER 

Take 1 quart of flour, 4 tablespoons melted lard, Yz teaspoon salt, 
2 teaspoons baking powder; mix as for biscuit with either sweet milk or 
water, roll thin, and line a pudding dish or dripping pan, 9 by 18 inches; 
mix 3 tablespoons flour and 2 of sugar together, and sprinkle over the crust; 
then pour in 3 pints canned Damson plums, and sprinkle over them 1 coffee 
cup sugar, wet the edges with a little flour and water mixed, put on upper 
crust, press the edges together, make two openings by cutting two incisions 
at right angles an inch in length, and bake in a quick oven. Peaches, apples, 
or any kind of fresh or canned fruit can be made in the same way. 

MINCE MEAT 

Four pounds lean beef, 3 pounds suet, 3 pounds raisins, 3 pounds cur- 
rants, 3 pounds brown sugar, 1 pint molasses, 2 ounces ground cinnamon, 
1 ounce ground cloves, 1 ounce nutmeg, juice and grated rind of 8 lemons. 
Boil the beef the day before chopping, pick out all gristle and stringy bits. 
Mix suet and beef well, season with salt and pepper. Thoroughly mix all 
ingredients and pack in a large jar. When ready to make pies, to a quart 
of the mixture add a pint of chopped apple and moisten with sweet cider. 
Add apple only as you bake. Taste, then add whatever your taste calls 
for; it may need more sweetening. Before putting on the top crust, put 
a few bits of butter and some whole raisins over the pie. Make the pie 
juicy. Keep the jar of mince meat in a cool place and it will keep all winter.

gether, taking care to provide holes in the center for the escape of the air. 
Pies from blackberries, raspberries, etc., are all made in the same way,

CAKES 

A FEW RULES FOR CAKE BAKING 

There are a few golden rules to be remembered in cake making. Beat the lard 
and sugar together until very light before putting in the other materials; then add the 
yolks of the egg, the liquid (either water or milk), then the flour, with which you have 
sifted the baking powder, and lastly the whites of eggs. 

Sweet milk will make a cake rich and close; water in the same cake will make it light 
and delicate. 

In nearly all recipes beat the white and yolks of eggs separately. 

Always sift the flour before measuring, then add the baking powder and sift again 
once or twice. 

Pastry flour makes a much lighter cake then bread flour; where real pastry flour 
cannot be obtained, the soft winter white flour will answer the purpose. 

Correct measurements are particularly necessary. Use standard measuring cups, 
preferably glass. The regulation tea and tablespoons. For the mixing and beating a large 
spoon v/ith slits is best. Only the best ingredients should be used in making cakes. 
Coarse sugar is apt to give a coarse texture, so choose the fine granulated, or better still 
the pulverized. Pastry flour is much better than bread flour. Never try to put a cake 
together until all the ingredients are measured and ready, the pans properly greased 
and dredged with flour, your oven at the proper heat, and it should be kept so until 
baking is completed. A slow oven causes a coarse textured cake, while a too hot oven 
will make the cake crack in the center. Open oven carefully and slowly — it is the rush 
of cold air into the oven that causes the cake to fall. The time for cake baking is divided 
into quarters, first quarter batter rises, second quarter continues to rise and begins to 
brown, third quarter continues browning, fourth quarter finishes baking and shrinks 
from pan. 

NUT AND DALE CAKE 

Three eggs beaten separately, 1 cup sugar added to yolks, 6 tablespoons 
flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, cup nuts, 1 cup dates; add beaten whites. 

WHITE CAKE 

Beat the whites of 2 eggs to a stifi" froth, set on ice while you prepare 
the egg mixture. Beat the yolks of 4 eggs, 1 cup granulated sugar, add 
3/;^ teaspoon of vanilla, 2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, add 
whites of eggs and sugar, i 2 cup of milk. When lightly and thoroughly 
mixed, turn in 4 small layers and bake in a quick oven about seven minutes. 

GOLD CAKE 

Cream II4 cups sugar, Yi cup butter, add yolks of 8 eggs beaten stiff,

BEVERAGES 

COFFEE FOR ONE HUNDRED 

Take 5 pounds roasted coffee, grind and mix with 6 eggs; make small 
muslin sacks, and in each place a pint of coffee, leaving room for it to swell ; 
put 5 gallons boiling water in a large coffee urn or boiler having a faucet at 
the bottom; put in part of the sacks and boil 2 hours; 5 or 10 minutes before 
serving raise the lid and add 1 or 2 more sacks, and if you continue serving 
several times add fresh sacks at regular intervals, taking out from time to 
time those first put in and filling up with boiling water as needed. In this 
way the full strength of the coffee is secured and the fresh supplies impart 
that delicious flavor consequent in a few moment's boiling. 

To make coffee for 20 persons, use 1 Yi pints ground coffee and 1 gallon 
of water. 

COFFEE 

Pour boiling water over the coffee, cover closely, boil 1 minute, remove 
to the side of the stove a few minutes to settle, and serve. Allow 2 heaping 
tablespoons coffee to a pint of water. The less time the coffee is cooked the 
more coffee is required, but the finer the flavor. 

TEA 

One scant teaspoon tea for each cup. Pour on freshly boiled water; 
let stand 2 minutes and serve. Never boil tea. For iced tea let stand until 
cold, pour off into pitcher, set on ice. Always serve with plenty of ice in 
glasses. 

COCOA 

Mix 7 tablespoons cocoa with twice the quantity of sugar; dissolve in 
1 quart boiling water. Put 1 quart rich milk in a double boiler on stove 
and let become scalding hot, but not boil. Then add to the cocoa and let 
stand on the back of the stove 10 minutes. 

FRUIT PUNCH 

Juice of 1 dozen oranges, 1 dozen lemons, 1 large can grated pineapple, 
1 quart of strawberries or red raspberries, 3 pints sugar. Let berries stand 
in sugar until juice is extracted. Then add to strained orange and lemon 
juice and pineapple. When berries are of out season candied or Maraschino 
cherries may be used. Dilute with 3 parts water to 1 of juice. Pour over 
large block of ice. 

PINEAPPLE ADE 

Pare and slice some very ripe pineapples, then cut the slices into small 
pieces. Put them with all their juice into a large pitcher and sprinkle among 
them plenty of powdered sugar. Pour on boiling water, allowing a small 
half-pint to each pineapple. Cover the pitcher and let it stand till quite 
cool, occasionally pressing down the pineapple with a spoon. Then set 
the pitcher for a while on ice, lastly strain the infusion into another vessel 
and transfer it to tumblers, putting into each glass some more sugar and 
a bit of ice. This is dehcious. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE WINE 

Pick over grapes, rejecting all unsound ones, almost cover with cold 
water, heat slowly, mash, and cook until all the juice is freed. Strain through 
jelly bag, measure juice, add Yi cup sugar for each quart. Boil for 4 minutes; 
seal while hot.

PRESERVED FRUITS 

CANNING AND PRESERVING 

In canning, the jars should be thoroughly washed; the fruits must be cooked in the 
iars or filled into them boiling hot. The lid must be sterile and put on the jar while 
both the jar and the lid are hot, and they must not be opened until needed for use. 

Large fruits are better cooked in the jars; small fruits may be cooked in the pre- 
serving kettle and filled in the jars, providing they are carefully handled. Small fruits 
should be just ripe, not under or over ripe. This is also a good thing to remember in 
jelly making. Overripe fruits will not combine with sugar to make a brittle, clean jelly 

A good clear syrup for preserving is made by using a pound of sugar to half a pint 
of water; before it begins to boil, heat into it the white of an egg slightly beaten; remove 
the scum as it rises until it is perfectly clear. 

For covering tumblers of jellies and preserves, melted paraffine is excellent. Pour 
it over the perfectly cold jelly and it will form a thin crust that is clean, tasteless and 
durable. It can be taken off and used again. Mutton tallow is sometimes used for the 
same purpose. 

CHERRY PRESERVES 

Choose sour ones — the early Richmond is good — seed all very care- 
fully, allow an amount of sugar equal to the fruit ; take half the sugar, sprinkle 
over the fruit, let stand an hour, pour into a preserving kettle, boil slowly 
ten minutes, skim out the cherries, add rest of sugar to the sjo-up, boil, 
skim and pour over the cherries; the next day drain off the syrup, boil, skim 
if necessary, add the cherries, boil 20 minutes, and seal up in small jars. 

LEMON BUTTER 

Juice and rind of 1 lemon, 1 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, yolks 
of 3 eggs. Cook in a double boiler about 30 minutes. 

GRAPE PRESERVES 

Pick from the stems, pop pulp from the skins, doing two at a time, one 
in each hand between the thumb and forefinger. Put pulp in a porcelain 
kettle and stew gently until the seeds are loosened; then strain and rub it 
through a sieve, weigh it with the skins and to every pound of this allow 1 
pound of granuhted suear. Put skins and juice in kettle, cover closely, and 
rook pbvly until the s'ins are tender; while still boiling add the sugar, and 
r-^ove the lettle bark, as it must not boil again; keep very hot for 15 minutes, 
then, seeing that the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, pour the fruit in cans, 
and £crew down the covers as soon as possible. 

PEAR PRESERVES 

Pare, cut in halves, core and weigh fif hard, boil in water until tender, 
and use the wat^ for the syrup), allow ^^ pound sugar for each pound of 
fruit, boil p few moments, skim and cool ; when lukewarm add pears, and boil 
gently until syrup has penetrated them and they look clear; some of the pieces 
will cook before tb-^ rest, and must be removed; when done, take out, boil 
down syrup a little rnd pour over them. A few cloves stuck here and there 
in the pears add a pleasant flavor. 



THE HANDY COOK BOOK 123 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES 

Stem and wash berries carefully, weigh and allow 1 pound of granulated 
sugar to each pound of fruit, place in layers in preserving kettle, place over 
fire, stir occasionally, heat to boiling point, let boil just 10 minutes, then pour 
in large plates and place in sun for 12 hours ; use no water, put up cold. When 
put on plates syrup will be very thin, but after sunning will be rich, thick 
and beautifully colored and the berries will be whole. Will keep indefinitely. 

WATERMELON PRESERVES 

Pare off green rind, but leave a little of the pink, cut in pieces. Throw 
into cold water, skim out, add 1 heaping teaspoon each of salt and powdered 
alum, let stand until dissolved, fill kettle with cold water, and place where it 
will slowly come to a boiling point, covering with a large plate to keep rinds 
under. Boil until easily pierced with a fork, drain, put into a syrup previous- 
ly prepared as follows: Bruise and tie in a muslin cloth 4 ounces ginger root, 
boil in 2 or 3 pints of water until highly flavored. Boil in another pan 3 
or 4 sliced lemons. Make a syrup of sugar and the water in which ginger 
and lemon were boiled, add the rinds and slices of lemons and boil slowly 
3/^ to ^ of an hour. Citrons may be prepared in the same way. 

LEMON JELLY 

Soak 1 box gelatine in 1 pint cold water 2 minutes, add 2 pints boiling 
water, 13^ cups sugar, stir until dissolved; add juice of 3 lemons, strain 
through jelly bag and mold in individual molds or tiny coffee cups. Serve 
with whipped cream. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Stew 1 quart berries in 1 pint water until tender, pour off juice, add 1 
pound sugar to every pint, boil and skim, test by dropping a little into c^ld 
water (when it dees not rr ingle \^ith water it is done). Kinse glasses in 
cold water before pouring in jelly to prevent sticking. The pulp may be 
sweetened and used for sauce. 

APPLE JELLY 

Quarter tart apples without peeling, or parings alone may be used. 
Cover with cold water, stew until tender; pour off juice, strain, boil 10 minutes 
then measure and add 2 cups sugar to 3 cups juice; cook about 10 minutes 
longer. One-half plum juice with the apples makes a nice jelly. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Five teaspoons granulated gelatine, 6 tablespoons water, llo cups 
orange juice, 6 teaspoons lemon juice, 9 tablespoons sugar. Soften gelatine 
in cold water, melt over warm water, add juices and sugar, strain and mold. 
Nice way to serve. Take 6 oranges, cut circular pieces of peel 1 inch in 
diameter, from stem end introduce handle of silver spoon into opening, 
remove pulp and juice, strain and use in making jelly. Fill orange cups with 
jelly, place in pan of ice; when jelly is firm cut lengthwise through skin and 
jelly into quarters. Serve garnished with green leaves or whipped cream 
piled in center. This quantity serves 6 persons. Nice for invalids. 



124 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

PLUM JELLY 

If plums are wild (not cultivated) put in pan and sprinkle with soda and 
pour hot water over them; let stand a few minutes and stir through them; 
take out and put on with water just to cover, or less if plums are very juicy; 
boil till soft, dip out juice with a china cup; then strain the rest through 
small salt bags (by the way, keep them for jelly bags, as they are just the 
thing) ; do not squeeze them. Take pound for pound of juice and sugar, or 
pint for pint, and boil for 8 or 10 minutes. Jelly will be nicer if only one 
measure or a measure and a half is made at one time; if more, boil longer; 
some boil juice 10 or 15 minutes, then add sugar and boil five minutes longer. 
It can be tested by dropping in a saucer and placing on ice or in a cool place. 
If it does not spread but remains rounded it is finished. 

CRANBERRY MARMALADE 

Select perfect berries, wash and put over the fire with very little 
water and cook until tender. Rub through a colander, then add as much 
sugar as fruit, return to fire and let come to boil. Serve cold, and it is nice 
molded in individual forms. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM 

Stew the berries in a little water, press through a coarse sieve, return 
to the kettle, add ^i pound sugar to each pound of the pulped gooseberry; 
boil ^i of an hour, stirring constantly. Pour in jars or bowls. 

PLUM BUTTER 

Take thoroughly ripe Ipums, wash and press through colander before 
cooking, put pulp over the fire, let come to a boil, add an equal quantity of 
sugar; cook until thick as desired. The flavor is much better than when 
cooked with seeds and skin, which give a bitter taste. 

CANNED PEACHES 

Pare, place peaches in a stone jar, cover thickly with sugar, let stand 
over night. In the morning, pour off juice, put over fire to boil, adding more 
sugar if necessary. Drop fruit in, let heat through, lift out, place in cans, 
pour syrup over and seal. This recipe is nice for any kind of fruit, as it is 
canned in its own juice. 

CANNED BERRIES 

Select those the skins of which have not been broken, or the juice will 
darken the syrup; fill cans compactly, set in a kettle of cold water, with a 
cloth beneath them, over an even heat; when sufficiently heated, pour over 
the berries a syrup of white sugar dissolved in boiling water (the richer 
the better for keeping, though not for preserving the flavor of the fruit), 
cover the cans closely to retain heat on the top berries. To insure full cans 
when cold, have extra berries heated in like manner to supply the shrinkage. 
If the fruit swims, pour off surplus syrup, fill with hot fruit, and seal up as soon 
as the fruit at the top is thoroughly scalded.

CANDIES 

FONDANT 

Boil 2 cups sugar and 1 of water, without stirring, until a silky hair 
is thrown off when dropped from a fork. Upon this test depends the success 
of the fondant. If too nard add a little water and cook again. When cool 
enough to bear finger in beat until soft, then knead on a cold platter or marble 
slab. Add flavoring and mold- This fondant may be made into a great 
variety of candies by using different flavorings and colorings, nuts, raisins, 
figs, dates and chocolates.

FOOD FOR SICK 

There are many food preparations in the market now — malted, peptonized, albu- 
menized, etc., adapted to nearly every condition, or degree of invalidism. Milk has come 
to be considered by many physicians as the most suitable food for those seriously ill, 
varied by eggs, and simple broths; therefore, it seems unnecessary to take space for more 
than a few of these combinations. 

Cleanliness and delicacy in all appointments, and dainty serving, often add greatly 
to the value of the food, and should never be overlooked. 

It is of the utmost importance that the food be delicately and carefully administered, 
and this should never be left to servants. It should be made as attractive as possible, 
served in the choicest ware, with the cleanest of napkins, and the brightest of silver. 
If tea is served, it should be freshly drawn, in a dainty cup, with a block of white sugar 
and a few drops sweet cream. Toast should be thin, symmetrical, well yellowed, free 
from crust, and just from the fire. Steak should be cut of the best tenderloin, delicately- 
broiled, and served with the nicest of roast potatoes. 

SNOW BALLS 

One sour apple, 1 cube jelly, 2 tablespoons rice, a speck of salt. Swell 
rice in milk or water, cook until partially done. Pare and core apple, drain 
milk off rice, put rice around apples and tie each up in a cloth. Put a bit 
of lemon peel, a clove or cinnamon and boil them well. Allow room for ex- 
pansion when tying cloth. When done untie and turn out on plate. Serve 
with jelly marmalade or sauce. 

SCRAPED BEEF 

Scrape H pound of beef from the tender side of the round. Have meat 
cut into thin slices. Place it upon a board and scrape until all the pulp 
is out of the meat separated from the tough, stringy fibres. Form into small 
balls, season with salt. Sear outside, leave inside red. Serve on small 
triangles of toast, garnished with parsley. 

EGG NOG 

One-half egg, % cup milk, 1^2 tablespoon sugar, few drops of vanilla 
and nutmeg. Separate the egg, beat yolk, add sugar and salt. Beat until 
creamy. Add milk and vanilla. Beat white until foamy and fold it in lightly. 
Serve immediately. 

BEEF TEA 

Take small quantity of perfectly lean, juicy beef, cut in small piecer, 
and put in glass fruit jar, seal and place in cold water in covered kettle. 
Boil several hours until juice is extracted. Remove beef and slightly season 
tea when serving. 

ALBUMENIZED ORANGE 

One-half egg white, juice 14. orange, sugar. To unbeaten egg white 
add orange juice, sweeten to taste and blend thoroughly. Strain and set 
on ice to cool. Sei've cold. 

ALBUMENIZED WATER 

One-half cup cold water boiled and cooled; lemon juice and sugar to 
taste, }/2 egg white. Put all ingredients together in a covered glass iar 
(fruit) and shake until thoroughly blended. If it sepai-ates, shake again. 



132 THE HANDY COOK BOOK 

If a person is not very ill, and likes egg white, serve with egg white as garnish, 
otherwise strain and serve, particularly if trying to hide the albumen. 

It is well for both nurse and patient to remember that nothing relieves 
nausea or vomiting sooner than drinking hot water in as great quantity 
and as hot as possible. 

TOAST WATER 

One fourth cup stale bread toasted, i^ cup boiling water, salt. Cut 
bread into thin slices one inch square. Dry thoroughly in oven until crisp

HISTORY OF KANSAS CITY 



The name "Kansas City" is supposed to be of Indian origin; the City was founded 
in 1839, first incorporated under the name "Town of Kansas," in 1850. This was changed 
to the "City of Kansas," in 1853, and to "Kansas City" in 1889. 

The first Post Office in Kansas City was established in 1845. The Hannibal Bridge, 
built across the Missouri River, and opened for traffic in 1869 was of vital interest to 
the life of the new City; this bridge was built by what was known as the Platte Valley 
Railroad, which afterwards became the Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs Rail- 
road. There are now four bridges across the Missouri River at or near Kansas City. 
Construction for the first railroad west of the Missouri River was started at Kansas 
City, August 10, 1863, by the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company, now known as the 
Union Pacific Railroad Company, and the first passenger train went out of Kansas City 
over this road November 28, 1864. 

The population of Greater Kansas City is 484,978, made up as follows: 

Kansas City, Missouri 338,068 

Kansas City, Kansas 122,798 

Independence 15,047 

Rosedale 9,065 

Of said population 61.8% are of native parentage and 80% are native born of either 
native or foreign parentage. 

White of native parentage 61.8 % 

White of foreign or mixed parentage 18.3% 

Negro 9.5%
