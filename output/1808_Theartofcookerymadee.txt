PREFACE. 



Tni; mode of cookerv wliicli the 
author of the following sheets has 
pursued for a series of years hav^- 
iiiii ohtained the most distiiiffviish- 
ed approbation of the pubhe, has 
indueed him to eomniit his praetiee 
to paper; in doins; wliich, a devia- 
tion Ih'is been made from the usual 
iritroihietorv^ methods of other trea- 
tises of the kind, in omitting to give 
particular directions for the choice 
of fish 5 meats, poultry, and vegeta- 
bles, 'and at what times they re^ 
spe(^tive] V mi^ht be in season, &c. &c* 



VI 



the author conceiving the simpler 
method to he the most acceptable; 
and J therefore, as actual knowledge 
must ever supersede written forms, 
he would advise a frequent atten- 
dance at the different markets, fully 
assured that experience will convey 
greater instruction in marketing than 
all the theories w^hich could be ad- 
vanced. There are, nevertheless, 
some useful observations interspers- 
ed in the course of the work for that 
purpose, the raithor having confin- 
ed himself chiefly to the practical 
part of cookery; he has also given 
some directions in a branch of the 
confectionarv business; in both of 
which it has been his constant en- 
deavour that they might be render- 
ed as simple and easy as possible, 
and that economy might pervadq 
the whole. 



The receipts are written for the 
least possible quantities in the dif- 
ferent made dishes and sauces, it 
being a frequent error in most of the 
books that they are too expensive and 
too long ; by which means the art 
has been rendered intricate in the 
extreme, both in theory and prac-- 
tice. 

Independant, also, of a close ad- 
herence to any given rules, tliere 
are other qualities essential ^to the 
completion of a thorough cook ; 
such as, an acute taste, a fertile in- 
vention, and a rigid attention %<} 
cleanliness. 

The preceding hints and subse- 
cpient directions, it is hoped, will 
prove fully adequate to perfection 
in coo.kery ; the work being entirely 



*^-? 



VI 11 

divested of the many useless receipts 
from other professions, (which have 
been uniformly introduced in books 
of the hke nature,) and nothing in- 
serted but what has an immediate 
reference to the art itself. 

There is prefixed a Bdl of Fare for 
each month in the year, as a speci- 
men of the seasons, which may be 
altered as judgment directs ; and an 
alphabetical Table of Contents, by 
which, from the first letter or word 
of the different articles, will be 
found their respective receipts.

THE 



ART OF COOKERY, 



BEEF STOCK {ov Brotll). 

jT^iUT chuck beef into pieces, put it into a pot^ 
^^ set it on the fire^ with a sufficient quantity of 
water to cover it. When it boils skim it clean ; 
add a bunch of parsley and thyme^ cleaned carrots, 
leeks, onions, turnips, celery, and a little salt. Let 
the meat boil till terser, skim off the fat, then 
strain it through a fine hair sieve. 

VEAL STOCK {OV Bvotll foV Soiips). 

Take a leg of veal and some lean ham, cut them 
into pieces, put them into a pan with a quart of 
water, some peeled carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, 
and celery ; draw them down till nearly tender, 
but of no colour ; then add a sufficient quantity 
of beef stock to cover the ingredients, boil all to- 
gether one hour, skim it free from fat, and strain 
it. Some game drawn down with it w411 make it 
excellent. 

N. B. I have directed the veal stock not to be 
drawn down to a colour, as in that state it will an- 
swer two purposes ; first, for white soups ; and, 
secondly, as it might be coloured with a bright 

B 



liquid to any height, which will be directed for 
gravy soups. It frequently happens, likewise, that, 
if not strictly attended to, it will burn. 

CONSUME, OR THE ESSENCE OF MEAT. 

Reduce veal stock to a good consistence, but be 
careful not to let it colour. 

CULLIS, OR A THICK GRAVY, 

Take slices of ham, veal, celerj^, carrots, turnips^ 
onions, leeks, a small bunch of sweet herbs, some 
allspice, black pepper, mace, a piece of lemon-peel, 
and two bay leaves; put them into a pan with a 
quart of water, Jind draw them down till of a light 
brown colour, but be careful not to let it burn ; 
then add to it a sufficient quantity of beef stock to 
cover it. When it boils, skim it very clean from fat, 
and thicken it with Horn- and water, or flour and 
butter passed. Let it boil gently three quarters of 
an hour; season it to the palate with cayenne pep- 
per, lemon juice, and salt; strain it through a tamis 
cloth or sieve, and add a little liquid of colour, 
which may be made as in the following receipt. 

LIQUID OF COLOUR ^OR SAUCES, &C. 

Put a quarter of a poutid of the best brown 
. sugar into a frying pan very clean from grease, 
and half a gill of water ; set it over a gentle fire, 
. stirring it with a wooden spoon till it is thoroughly 
burnt and of a good briglit colour, then add half 
a pint of water; when it boils skim it and strain 
it. Put it by for use in a vessel close covered. 



BENSHAMELLE. 

Take white veal, lean ham, turnips, celery, 
onions cut in pieces, a blade of mace, a little whole 
white pepper ; sweat them down till three parts 
tender, then add to it with beef stock. Let it 
boil, skim it clean, and thicken with flour and 
water, or flour and butter passed; add to it a suffi- 
cient quantity of cream to make it quite white. 
Let it simmer gently half an hour, and strain it 
through a tan i is cloth. 

N. C Let it be of the thickness of light batter, 

TO MARE A PASSING OF FLOUR AND BUTTER FOR 
CULLIS OR BENSHAMELLE. 

Put fresh butter into a stewpan over a fire, when 
it is melted add a sufficient quantity of sifted flour 
to make it into a paste, and mix them together 
with a whisk over a very slow fire for ten minutes. 

SOUP A LA REINE. 

Take thiee quarts of veal stock with a blade of 
mace boiled in it ; then strain it to the crumb of 
four penny french rolls, three quarters of a pound 
of sweet almonds blanched and pounded very fine, 
likewise the white meat of dressed fowd pounded. 
Let all simmer together for ten minutes, and rub 
them through a tamis cloth till the soup is of a 
proper thickness; season it to the palate w^ith salt; 
make it boil, and serve it up with a gill of cream 
in it,

with crust of french bread cut into small round 
pieces.

eggs;; whisk them with the stocky set it over a fire, 
let it boil gently ten minutes^ then strain it through 
a tamis cloth. This stock is required for rice, 
brown vermicelli, celery, sante, or turnip soups. 

N. B. I have directed the brown stock, for gravy 
!?oups only, to be cleared w ith eggs, as that me- 
thod has been most approved, it being pleasant to* 
the eye, and equally agreeable to the palate.

REAL TURTLE. 

Hang the turtle up by the hind fins, and cut oft" 
the head overnight; in the morning cut oft' the 
fore fins at the joints, and the callipee all round ; 
then take out the entrails, and be careful not to 
break the gall ; after which cut oft" the hind fins 
and all the meat from the bones, callipee and cal- 
lipash ; then chop the callipee and callipash into 
pieces ; scald them together, the fins being whole, 
but take care not to let the scales set. When 
cleaned, chop the fins into pieces four inches long; 
wash the pieces of the callipee, callipash, and 
fins, and put them into a pot with the bones and 
a sufficient quantity of water to cover ; then add 
a bunch of sweet herbs and whole onions, and 
skim it when the liquor boils. When the fins are 
nearly done take them out, together with the re- 
mainder of the turtle, when done, picked free from 
bone. Then strain the liquor and boil it down 
till reduced to one third part; after which cut the 
meat into pieces four times larger than dice ; put 
it into a pot, add a mixture of herbs chopped fine, 
such as knotted marjoram^ savory, thyme, parsley, 
a very little basil, some chopped onions, some 
beaten spices, as allspice, a few cloves, a little 
mace, black pepper, salt, some veal stock, and the 
liquor that was reduced. Boil the meat till three 



13 

parts donej pick it free from herbs, strain the li- 
quor through a tamis sieve, make a passing of flour 
and three quarters of a pound of fresh butter, mix- 
ing it well over a fire for some time, and then add 
to it madeira wine, ( if a turtle of seventy pounds 
weight, three pints) and the liquor of the meat. 
When it boils, skim it clean, season to the palate 
with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt, and 
strain it to the pieces of fins and shell in one pot, 
and the lean meat into another ; and if the turtle 
produce any real green fat, let it be boiled till 
done, then strained, cut in pieces, and added to the 
fins and shell, and then simmer each meat till ten- 
der. When it is to be served up, put a little fat 
at the bottom of the tureens, some lean in the 
centre, and more fat at the top, with egg and 
forcemeat balls, and a few entrails. 

N. B. The entrails must be cleaned well, then 
boiled in water till very tender, and preserved as 
white as possible, and just before they are strained 
off add the balls. If a callipash is served up, the 
shell to be cut down on each side, and chop the 
pieces for the soup ; the remaining part of ihc, 
back shell to be pasted round with a raised crust, 
egged, ornamented, and baked, and the soup serw 
ed in it in the same manner as in the tureens. 

CALLIPEE. 

Take a quarter of the under part of a turtle of 
sixty pounds weight, and scald it, and when done, 
take the shoulder-bone out and fill the cavity with 
a good high-seasoned forcemeat made with tlie 
lean of the turtle ; put it into a stewpan, and 
add a pint of madeira wine^ cayenne pepper, salt. 



14 

lemon juice, a clove of garlick, a little mace, ^ 
few cloves and allspice tied in a bag, a bunch of 
sweet herbs/ some whole onions, and three quarts 
of good beef stock. Stew gently till three parts 
done ; then take the turtle and put it into another 
stew pan, with some of the entrails boiled and some 
^gg balls ; add a little thickening of Hour and 
Ijulter to the liquor, let it boil, and strain it to the 
turtle, &c. then stew it till tender, and the liquor 
almost reduced to a glaize. Serve it up in a deep 
dish, pasted round as a callipash, ornamented and 
baked. 

N. B. I think the above mode of serving it up 
in a dish the best, as it frequently happens the shell 
of the caiiipee fs not properly baked. 

GLAIZE FOR HAMS, LARDING, ROASTED POULTRY, &C. 

Take a leg of veal, lean of ham, beef, some in- 
diiTerent fowls, celery, turiiips,5carrots, onions, leeks 
cleaned and cut into pieces, a little lemon peel, 
mace, and black pepper, a small quantity of each, 
three quarts of water, sweat them down till three 
parts done ; then add a sufficient quantity of water 
to cover the meat, and boil it till the goodness is 
extracted ; skim it, and strain the liquor into a 
large pan. Next day take the fat from it very 
clean ; set the stock over a fire, and when warm 
clear it w ith whites and a fev/ yolks of eggs ; then 
add a little colour and strain it through a tamis ; 
boil it quick till reduced to a glaizi^, and be care- 
ful not to let it burn. 

N. B. In the same manner may be made glaize 
of separate herbs or roots, vvhich will be service- 
able on board a ship, or in the country, where 

11 



15 

herbs or roots cannot be procured at all tinies ; and 
they are to be preserved ia bottles^ as they will not, 
when cold, be of a portable substance. 

FISH PLAIN BOILED TO BE PREPARED THUS I 

Put them in clean boiling pump water well 
salted, and when served up to be garnished with 
fresh picked parsley and scraped horseradish ; ex- 
cept salt fish, which should be properly soaked, 
then cut in pieces and put in cold water, and when 
it boils let it simmer six or eight min\ites, and serve 
it up on a napkin w ith boiled parsnips and pota- 
toes round, or on a plate, and egg sauce in a boat. 

N. B. Fish should be chosen very fresh and of 
good appearance, it adding as much to their 
beauty as gratifying to the palate when dressed, 
there being in my opinion but two sorts — good 
and bad. But as an exception to the above ob- 
servation, skate will^e better for eating if kept for 
one or two days in a cool place before it is dressed. 

FISH GENERALLY FRIED, 

Pieces of skate. Perch. 

Whitings. Flounders. 

Fillets of haddocks. Slices of hollibut. 

Smelts. Slices of cod. 
Soles. 

TO PREPARE THE ABOVE FOR FRYING, &C. 

Wipe the diiFerent sorts offish dry^ beat yolk of 
eggs, and spread it over them wiih a paste brush; 
then put crumbs of bread over the egg\ Flave 
plenty of lard in an iron frying pan, and when it

16 

a fine gold colour; drain them dry, and serve them 
up ^vith fried parsley and scraped horseradish. 

N. B. The crumhs to he rubhed throug'h a hair 
sieve. The parsley also to he picked, washed, and 
dried with a cloth, then to be put into the lard 
not very hot, and fried of a green colour. Drain 
it dry, and sprinkle a little salt over. 

BROILED FISH PREPARED THUS *. 

Wipe the fish dry, flour them well, and have 
the gridiron clean ; then rub the bars with a veal 
caul, and put the fish at a proper distance. Broil 
them gently over a clear coal fire till of a fine co- 
lour, and serve them up directly. 

N. B. Fish in general to be floured, except her- 
rings^ which are only to be scored with a knife, and 
the following methods of broiling other fish to be 
observed. 

BROILED SALMON TO BE PREPARED THUS I 

Take pieces or slices of salmon, wipe them dry, 
dip them in sweet oil, and season v/ith pepper and 
salt; fold them in pieces of writing paper, broil 
over a clear fire, and serve them up very hot. 

N. B. In the same manner arc to be done red 
mullets, &c. 

BIvOlLED MACKAREL, COMMON W\VY.

mon, and when it boils let it be of a proper thick= 
ness, and strain it to the fish ; then stew it ge nly, 
and serve it up in a deep dish with the liquor, and 
fried bread round it. If carp or tench, some of 
the iiard roe mixed in batter and fried in pieces. 
The roes likewise of different fish may be stewed 
in the same manner, and served up as a dish of 
themselves. Eels, soles, or other fish may be 
done the same way. 

BAIGNETS QF FISH. 

Make a light forcemeat with fish of any kind. 
Afterwards put a small quantity into pieces of puff 
paste, the size of a common puff; then fry them 
in boding' lard, drain them dry. Serve them up 
with trouffle, or benshamelle sauce round them. 

N. B. Meat, &c. may be done the same way. 

WATER SOUCHEE OF PERCH, FLOUNDERS, SOLES^ 
EELS, &C. 

Take perch cleaned and fresh crimped ; put 
them into boiling pump water well seasoned with 
salt, and when they boil, skim them clean. Take 
them out with a large skimmer, put them into a 
deep dish, strew parsle}^ roots and scalded parsley 
over, and add some of the liquor. Serve them up 
as hot as possible, with slices of brown bread and 
butter on a plate. 

N. B. The time the fish are to boil must be ac- 
cording to their size ; and the parsley roots are to 
be cleaned, cut into slips, and boiled by themselves 
till tender,

biRECTIOTSS FOR ROASTING. 

Observe that in roasting it requires a good quick 
fire, but not too strong, and the meats should be 
^veil-jointed, trimmed neat, and covered with 
paper, to perserve it from being too high a colour. 
Beef and mutton should not be done too much ; 
veal, pork, and lamb, should be done well ; and 
some little time before it is to be served up, take 
the paper off, sprinkle the meat with salt, and 
when of a proper colour, froth it w ith butter and 
flour. Large poultry to be papered and done in 
the same manner ; but small poultry, such as 
chickens, woodcocks, rabbits, wild fowls, &c. will 
not require papering. The time the several arti- 
cles will take roasting depends upon a little prac- 
tice, as the weather and the different strengths of 
fires make a material alteration. I have given 
directions for some particular roasts which re- 
quire a preparation; as for others which are serv- 
ed with sauces, they may be found under re- 
spective heads; and for the trimmings of meat, &r, 
1 have wrote a receipt to make into soup, or they 
may be put into the beef stock pot. 

SOUP FOR A FAMILY. 

Cut the particles of meat from the trimmings of 
different joints, as beef, mutton, veal, pork, &c. 
and when done put the bones into a pot, cover 
with wateY, and boil them till the goodness is ex- 
tracted. Then strain the liquor, wash the trim- 
mings of the vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, 
onions, leeks, celery, and a little cabbage. Cut 
all small, put them into a pot with the above 
liquor and some split peas ; boil till the peas are 



6S 

tender, add a little dry mint, and rub it tlirougli 
a tamis cloth or sieve. Then season the meat 
Avitli pepper and salt^ sweated down till three parts 
fender^ and add the pulp. Boil all together till 
the meat is done^, ?kim it and serve it up with fried 
bread in the form of dice, 

TO PREPARE A HAUNCH OF VENISON^ OR MLTTON 
FOR ROASTING. 

Take great care the vension is well hung and

and put butter and plenty of salt over it ; then 
put paste confined on with four or five sheets of 
paper braced with packthread. Roast it gentlv, 
and ten minutes before it is done^ take off the 
paper^, let it colour gradually^ and froth it with 
flour and butter. Serve up with the venison warm 
currant jelly in a boat, and some good gravy with 
a little red port in it in another sauce boat.

two eggs (or milk), pepper, salt, and an anchovie 



chopped (if approved). Mix all well to^'ctbcr 
with some bread crumbs. 

OBSERVATIONS ON MEAT AND FOULTRY, 

Mcatj to be preferred when of a good fatness 
and the lean appears juicy^ but not particularly 
streaked with fat;, as it then frequently happens to 
eat hard. When the season will permit let it hang 
for a week and not more^ as I have found that 
period bring it to its best state. Poultry^ likewise, 
should be chosen tolerably fat and of a soft grain. 
Let them hang three or four days, which will add 
to their better eating : except woodcocks, snipes^ 
larks, or pigs^ which should be dressed fresh. Be 
particular that the poultry are trussed very neat. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT, gTEAKS, AND POULTRY 

Cut slices of chuck beef, veal, and lean ham ; 
pare onions, turnips, a carrot, and cut them w ith 
celery ; then add a bunch of parsley and thyme, a 
few whole pepper, and a little mace. Put all the 
ingredients into a stew pan, set them over a mo- 
derate fire, sweat down till the liquor becomes of 
a light brown colour, and be careful not to let it 
burn. Discharge it with water or beef stock, 
season to the palate w ith salt, and, if required, 
add a little liquid of colour. Let it simmer till 
the meit is perfectly done, skim it free ixora fat, 
and btrain it through atamiscloth. 

I'ELOE OF RICE

cbicken half boiled and a piece of pickle pork three 
parts boiled^ and cover with the rice. When it is 
to be served up, put the fowl and pork at the bot-r 
torn of the dish, the rice over, and garnish with 
boiled or fried button onions and halves of hard 
eggs, which should be hot. 

PELC^E OF RICE ANOTHER WAY. 

Wash and pick one pound of rice^ boil it in

of boiling pump water, kept skimmed, and preserv- 
ed as white as possible. The time thej' will take 
dressing depends on a little practice., as in roasting.

better to cut them with a sharp knife ; then to 
cutout small pieces round the edges to make them

TO DRY ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS. 

Gather the largest firm artichokes when in 
■season, cut off the stalks, and boil them till the 
leaves and choke can be taken away. After- 
wards put them on a baking plate and set them in 
a very slow heated oven, or hang them up in a 
warm place to dry, and when perfectly so put 
them into paper bags. When they are wanted 
for use lay them in warm water and s?Jt, and 
when pliable trim them neat, braise them in stock 
and lemon juice, which will perserve them white, 
and when done enough, if for ragout, cut them 
into pieces; if for dishes, serve them whole with 
good cuUis sauce over them, 

TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS, &C, 

Gather jerkins not too large, lay thorn in a 
strong brine of salt and Vv ater for three days^ then 
wipe them dry, and put them into stone jars. 
Then put a sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover 
them into a preserving pan, add plenty of whole 
ginger and black pepper, a middling quantity of 
mace, allspice and cloves, ^ome slices of horse- 
radish, peeled onions, eschalots, andii small quan^- 
tity of garlick. Let the ingredients boil for tea 
minutes, and pour them with the liquor over the 
cucumbers^ cover the jars with cabbage leaves and 
a plate, set them in a warm place, the next day 
drain the liquor from them, boil it, and pour over 
them again, and if on the third day they are not 
green enough, boil the vinegar again, pour it over.

and when cold tic bladder and white leather over 
the jars, and set them in a dry place. 

N. B. In the same manner may be done walnuts, 
love-appleSj barberries, capsicums, French beans, 
nasturtiums, and small pickling melons peeled 
\evy thin and cut into quarters, or walnuts may 
be scalded and put into salt and water for a week, 
changing the water three times, 

RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN PICKLING. 

It is recommended that the best common vi- 
negar be in general used for pickling, and that it 
be put into a well-cleaned copper or brass pre- 
serving pan just before it is to be put over the 
fire, and when it boils not to remain in the pan. 

There can be no occasion of the many arts tha^ 
are used in order to preserve the ingredients green 
if the vegetables are gathered fresh, on a dry day, 
when in season, and the process followed that has 
been recommended. 

Further directions could be given that might 
be attended with greater expence, but which 
would scarcely answer abetter purpose, excepting 
only to those who are in the habit of extensive 
practice. 

TO PICKLE 0NI0N3. 

Peel small button onions into milk and water, 
in which put plenty of salt ; set it over a fire, 
and when it boils strain the onions, wipe them 
dry, and put them into glasses. Have ready cold 
white wine vinegar, in which whole white pepper, 
ginger, mace, and slices of horseradish have been 
boiled. Pour it over the onions and cover them 
with bladder and leather. 



167 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. 

Take a sufficient quantitv of double distilled 
white wine vinegar to cover the mushrooms ; add 
to it whole white pepper^ ginger, mace^ peeled 
eschalots, and a small quantity of garlick if ap- 
proved; boil all together ten minutes and let it 
stand till cold. Then peel fresh forced button 
mushrooms into watcr^ wash them clean, strain, 
and put them into a stewpan. To a quart of 
mushrooms add the juice of a lemon and table 
spoonful of salt Cover the pan close^ set it over 
a fire, and when the liquor is sufficiently drawn 
from the mushrooms put the whole into glasses 
and cover them with the pickle. Tie bladder 
and white leather over the glasses. 

The general rule has been deviated from of 
making the pickle for onions and mushrooms with 
double distilled white wine vinegar, as in this iii- 
slance it is requisite to preserve them white. It 
is likewise recommended that they be put into 
small jars or glasses for use ; for this reason^ that, 
if exposed to the air but for a short space of time, 
tlicy will discolour. 

TO PICKLE BEET ROOTS, 

Boil the roots till three parts done, and cut 
Ihem into slices of an inch thick. Then take a 
sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover them, and 
add to it allspice, a few cloves, mace, black pepper^ 
slices of horseradish^ some onions, eschalots, a 
little pounded ginger, some salt, and a few bay 
leaves. Eoii the ingredients together twenty 



16g 

minutes and strain it, and when the pickle is cold 
add a little bruised cochineal. Put the slices of 
beet into jars, add the pickle, put a small quan> 
tity of sweet oil on the top, and tie the jars down 
close. 

N. B. When the beet is wanted for use mix well, 
together sweet oil, mustard, some of the liquor in 
which the roots were pickled, and a very little 
sifted sugar. Lay the slices in a deep plate and 
pour the mixture over. 

TO PICKLE ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS. 

Take large fresh and sound artichokes, boi} 
them just enough to take the leaves and choke

after which boil (for five minutes) a sufficient 
quantity of vinegar to cover them, in which put 
whole allspice, black pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, 
eschalots, salt, a few bay leaves, and some slices 
of horseradish. Drain and wipe dry the bottoms, 
put them into jars, add the liquor and ingredients 
to them, and tie them down close. When they are 
fit for use serve them up in a deep plate with a 
little of the pickle, oil, and mustard mixed with it, 

TO PICKLE LARGE CUCUMJJERS. 

Peel them very thin, cut them into halves, throw 
the seeds away, and lay the cucumbers in salt for

for use. 

TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE. 

Cut a fresh light red cabbage into slips^ ^vash it

for two days. Then boil together for half an 
hour a suflicient quantity of vinegar to cover the 
cabbage, together with bruised black pepper, 
mace, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and mus- 
tard seed, a middling quantity of each. Strain 
the vinegar and ingredients, and let them stand 
till cold; then add a little bruised cochineal, 
drain the cabbage on a large sieve till dry, put it 
into the jars down close ; or the liquor may be 
poured over the cabbage boiling hot; and when 
cold, before the jars are tied down, add a little 
bruised cochineal. This method will make the 
cabbage sooner fit for use. 

N. B. Onions may be peeled and done whole 
in the same manner, and mixed with red cabbage. 

TO PICKLE CURRANTS. 

To a quart of double distilled white wine 
vinegar add half a pound of loaf sugar, whole 
ginger, one ounce of salt, and a pint of red 
currant juice; boil all together, skim it clean, 
and let it stand till cold. Then pick and put 
some best ripe red currants into glasses, fill them 
with the pickle, and cover them down close with 
bladder and leather. 

TO PICKLE BARBERRIES. 

Bruise and strain ripe barberries, and to a pint 



170

coriander seeds, and so on alternately ; when the 
tub is nearly full put a weight over to press it well^ 
and set it in a cool dry place covered \^ith a 
coarse cloth. When it is wanted for use put 
some of the cabbage into boiling water over a 
fire for five minutes, and strain it. Have ready 
some pieces of salted bouille beef (of a quarter of 
a pound each) nearly boiled enough; likewise 
some pieces of pickle pork of the same number 
and weight. Then put them into a stesvpan^ add 
the cabbage, fresh butter, a little vinegar, onions 
sliced very thin, some whole pe])per^ allspice, and 
raace^, tied in a bit of cloth. Let all stew till tender ; 
then take out the spices^ season the cabbage to the

over a moderate fire^ and when the apples are 
tender take the peel and spices out ; then add a 
bit of fresh butter^ and sugar to the palate. 

OBSERVATIONS IN RESPECT OF FISH SAUCES, &C. 

l^et it be particularly observed that fish sauces 
should be of the thickness of light batter, so that 
it mig'ht adhere to the lish when dressed, it being 
a frequent error that they are either too thick or 
too thin. The thickening should be made with 
the best white flour sifted, and some water, mixed 
smooth with a wooden spoon or a whisk, and to 
be of the consistence of light batter also. A little 
of it is recommended to be always ready where 
there is much cooking, as it is frequently wanted 
both in fish and other sauces. 

There are, likewise, other articles repeatedly 
wanted for the use of stove-work ; and as their pos- 
session has been found to obviate much inconve- 
nience and trouble, they are here enumerated : that 
is to say, liquid of colour preserved in a bottle, 
strained lemon juice preserved in the same manner, 
cayenne pepper, groundspices, ground pepper and 
salt mixed, which should be preserved separately 
in small jars; and every day, when wan ■en, fresh 
breadcrumbs rubbed through a hair sieve ; par- 
sley, thymes, eschalots, savory, marjoram, and 
lemon peel, chopped very fine, and put on a dish 
in separate partitions. 

Directions are not given for serving tli^ iish 
sauces with any particular kind of fisb, — such as 
turbot or salmon with lobster sauce, &c. but the 
receipts have been written only for the making 
them : therefore it is recommended that every 
n2 



180 

person make a choice^ and not be biassed altoge- 
tlier hy custom. 

GREEN SAUCE FOR DUCKLINGS OR GREEN GEESE. 

Pick green spinach or sorrel, wash it, and bruise 
it in a marble mortar, and strain the liquor 
through a tamis cloth. To a gill of the juice add 
a little loaf sugar^ the yolk of a raw egg, and a 
spoonful of vinegar; if spinach juice, then put 
one ounce of fresh butter, and whisk all together 
over a fire till it begins to boil. 

N. B. Should the sauce be made of spinach 
juice instead of vinegar, there may be put two 
table spoonfuls of the pulp of gooseberries rubbed 
through a hair sieve. 

FENNEL SAUCE FOR MACKAREL, EITHER BOILED, 
OR BROILED. 

Pick green fennel, mint, and parsley, a little of 
each ; w ash, boil them till tender, drain and press 
them, chop them fine, add melted butter, and 
serve up the sauce immediately, for should the 
herbs be mixed with the butter any length of time 
before it is to be served up, they will be discolour- 
ed. The same ©bservation should be noticed in 
making parsley and butter sauce. 

N. B. If approved there maybe added some pulp 
of green gooseberries rubbed tbroiigh a hair sieve^ 
and a little sifted sugar. 

BREAD SAUCE, FOR TURKIES, GAME, &C. 

Soak a piece of crumb of bread with half a 
pint of milk or cream, add a peeled middling-sized

is absorbed bryise the bread, mix with it two 
ounces of fresh butter, a little white pepper, and 
salt; andwhen it is to be served up take out the 
oaion, 

MELTED BUTTER. 

In order to prevent butter from oiling, the flour 
and water that maybe sufficient for the quantity 
of butter should be made boiling, skimmed clean, 
and the butter added to dissolve, being careful it 
is of a proper thickness. 

In the same manner may be made fish sauces, 
adding the liquor of the lobsters or oysters, &c. 
with fiour and \yater, and when boiling add the 
butter with the other ingredients. 

TO MAKE MELON CITRON. 

Take middling-sized melons when half ripe,

them simmer a quarter of an hour: the next day 
boil them up again, and so on for three d&js; then 
take them out, and to the syrup putsome mountain 
wine, a little brandj^^ and more sugar; clarify it^ 
and boil it nearly to a candied height, put the me- 
lons into it and boil them ; then put them in glasses, 
and cover them close with bladder and leather. 

RUSKS, OR TOPS AND BOTTOMS. 

Take two eggs beat up, add them to a pint of 
good mild yeast and a little milk. Sift four poundsi 
of best white flour, and set a -pong;e with th*? 



182 

above ingredients ; then make boiling half a pound 
of ftesh butter and some milk, a sufficient quan- 
tity to make the sponge the stiffness of common 
dough. Let it lay in the kneading trough till 
well risen ; then mould and make it into the form 
of loaves of the bigness of small teacups ; after 
which batch them flat, bake them in a moderate 
oven, and when nearly done take them out, Cut 
the top from the bottom, and dry them till of a 
nice^ colour on tin plates in the oven. 

V/AYERS, 

Take a table spoonful of orange flower water, 
a table spoonful of flour, the same of good cream, 
sifted sugar to the palate, and a dessert spoonful 
of syrup of cinnamon ; beat all the ingredients 
together for twenty minutes ; then make the 
wafer-tongs hot, and pour a little batter just suf- 
flcient to cover the irons ; bake them over a slow 
fire, and when taken from the tongs roll them 
round, and preserve them in a dry place, 

CRACKNELS, 

To half a pound of best white flour sifted add 
half a pound of sifted loaf sugar, a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, two table spoonfuls of rose 
water, a little salt, the yolks ^nd whites of three 
eggs beat up, and mix all well together for twenty 
minutes. Then roll it out, cut it into what shapes 
you please with a pastry cutter, put them on 
baking plates rubbed with butter, wash the tops 
of the paste with whites of eggs well beaten, and 
bake them in a brisk oven.
