INTRODUCTION. 

OF ALL the arts upon which the physical well-being of 
man, in his social state, is dependent, none has been 
more neglected than that of cookery, though none is 
more important, for it supplies the very fountain of life. The 
preparation of human food, so as to make it at once whole- 
some, nutritive, and agreeable to the palate, has hitherto been 
beset by imaginary difficulties and strong prejudices. 

Many persons associate the idea of wealth with culinary 
perfection ; others consider unwholesome, as well as expen- 
sive, everything that goes beyond the categories of boiling, 
roasting, and the gridiron. All are aware that wholesome 
and luxurious cookery is by no means incompatible with lim- 
ited pecuniary means ; whilst in roasted, boiled, and broiled 
meats, which constitute what is termed true American fare, 
much that is nutritive and agreeable is often lost for want of 
skill in preparing them. Food of every description is whole- 
some and digestible in proportion as it approaches nearer to 
the state of complete digestion, or, in other words, to that 
state termed chyme, whence the chyle or milky juice that 
afterwards forms blood is absorbed, and conveyed to the 
heart. Now nothing is further from this state than raw meat 
and raw vegetables. Fire is therefore necessary to soften 
them, and thereby begin that elaboration which is consum- 
mated in the stomach. The preparatory process, which forms 
the cook'-s art, is more or less perfect in proportion as the ali- 
ment is softened, without losing any of its juices or flavor — 
for flavor is not only an agreeable but a necessary accom- 
paniment to wholesome food. Hence it follows, that meat 
very much underdone, whether roasted or boiled, is not so 
Avholesome as meat well done but retaining all its juices. 
And here comes the necessity for the cook's skill, which is so 
often at fault even in these simple modes of preparing human 
nourishment. 



INTRODUCTION. 

Pork, veal, lamb, and all young meats, when not thoroughly 
cooked, are absolute poison to the stomach ; and if half-raw 
beef or mutton are often eaten with impunity, it must not 
be inferred that they are wholesome in their semi-crude state, 
but only less unwholesome than the young meats. 

Vegetables, also, half done, which is the state in which they 
are often sent to the table, are productive of great gastric 
derangement, often of a predisposition to cholera. 

A great variety of relishing, nutritive, and even elegant 
dishes, may be prepared from the most homely materials, 
which ma}^ not only be rendered more nourishing, but be 
made to go much further in a large family than they usually 
do. The great secret of all cookery, except in roasting and 
broiling, is a judicious use of butter, flour, and herbs, and the 
application of a very slow fire — for good cooking requires 
only gentle simmering, but no boiling up, which only renders 
the meat hard. Good roasting can only be acquired by prac- 
tice, and the perfection lies in cooking the whole joint thop 
oughly without drying up the juice of any part of it. This is 
also the case with broiling; while a joint under process of 
boiling, as we have said, should be allowed to simmer gently. 

With regard to made dishes, as the horrible imitations of 
French cookery prevalent in America are termed, we must 
admit that they are very unwholesome. All the juices are 
boiled out of the meat, which is swimming in a heterogenous 
compound, disgusting to the sight, and seasoned so strongly 
with spice and Cayenne pepper enough to inflame the stomach 
of an ostrich. 

French cookery is generally mild in seasoning, and free 
from grease ; it is formed upon the a^bove-stated principle of 
reducing the aliment as near to the state of chyme as possi- 
ble, without injury to its nutritive qualities, rendering it at 
once easy of digestion and pleasant to the taste. 




-^'VtKlS)^ 



HINTS ON MARKETINQ. 

In the first place, the housewife ought, where it is possible, 
to do her marketing herself, and pay 7^eady money for every- 
thing she purchases. This is the only way in which she can 
be sure of getting the best goods at the lowest price. We re- 
peat that this is the only way compatible with economy ; be- 
cause, if a servant be entrusted with the buying, she will, if 
she is not a good judge of the quality of articles, bring home 
those she can get for the least money (and these are seldom 
the cheapest); and even if she is a good judge, it is ten to one 
against her taking the trouble to make a careful selection. 

When the ready-money system is found inconvenient, and 
an account is run with a dealer, the mistress of the house 
ought to have a pass-book in which she should write down 
all the orders herself, leaving the dealer to fill in only the 
prices. Where this is not done, and the mistress neglects to 
compare the pass-book with the goods ordered every time 
they are brought in, it sometimes happens, either by mistake, 
or the dishonesty of the dealer, or the servant, that goods are 
entered which were never ordered, perhaps never had, and 
that those which were ordered are overcharged ; and if these 
errors are not detected at the time, they are sure to be diffi- 
cult of adjustment afterwards. For these and other economic 
reasons, the housewife should avoid running accounts, and 
pay ready-money. 



RUIvKS KOR EATING. 

Dr. Hall, on this important subject, gives the following ad- 
vice : — 

1. Never sit down to table with an anxious or disturbed 
mind ; better a hundred times intermit that meal, for there 
will then be that much more food in the world for hungrier 
stomachs than yours; and besides, eating under such circum- 
stances can only, and will always, prolong and aggravate the 
condition of things. 



— 12 — 

2. Never sit down to a meal after any intense mental effort, 
for physical and mental injury are inevitable, and no one lias 
a right to deliberately injure body, mind or estate. 

3. Never go to a full table during bodily exhaustion — desig- 
nated by some as being worn out, tired to death, used up, 
over done, and the like. The wisest thing to be done under 
such circumstances is to take a cracker and a cup of warm 
tea, either black or green, and no more. In ten minutes you 
will feel a degree of refreshment and liveliness which will be 
pleasantly surprising to you ; not of the transient kind which 
a glass of liquor affords, but permanent ; but the tea gives 
present stimulus and a little strength, and before it subsides, 
nutriment begins to draw from the sugar, and cream, and 
bread, thus allowing the body gradually, and by safe degrees, 
to regain its usual vigor. Then, in a couple of hours, a full 
meal may be taken, provided that it does not bring it later 
than two hours before sundown ; if later, then take nothing 
for that day in addition to the cracker and tea, and the next 
day you will feel a freshness and vigor not recently known. 

No lady will require to be advised a second time, who will 
conform to the above rules ; while it is a fact of no unusual 
observation among intelligent physicians, that eating heartily, 
and under bodily exhaustion, is not unfrequently the cause 
of alarming and painful illness, and sometimes sudden death. 
These things being so, let every family make it a point to as- 
semble around the table with kindly feelings — with a cheerful 
humor, and a courteous spirit ; and let that member of it be 
sent from it in disgrace who presumes to mar the re-union by 
sullen silence, or impatient look, or angry tone, or complaining 
tongue. Eat ever in thankful gladness, or away with you to 
the kitchen, you "ill-tempered thing, that you are." There 
was good philosophy in the old-time custom of having a 
buffoon or music at the dinner-table. 



K[O^V TO SEIvECT JVIEAT. 

Ox-Beep, when it is young, will have a fine open grain, and 
a good red color ; the fat should be white, for when it is of a 
deep yellow color, the meat is seldom very good. The grain 



— 13 — 

of cow-beef is closer, the fat whiter, and the lean scarcely so 
red as that of ox-beef. When you see beef, of which the fat 
is hard and skinny, and the lean of a deep red, 3'ou may be 
sure that it is of an inferior kind : and when the meat is old, 
you may know it by a line of liorny texture running through 
the meat of the ribs. 

Mutton must be chosen by the firmness and fineness of the 
grain, its good color, and firm white fat. It is not considered 
prime until the sheep is about five years old. 

Lamb will not keep long after it is killed. It can be discov- 
ered by the neck end in the fore-quarter if it has been killed 
too long, the veins in the neck being bluish when the meat is 
fresh, but green when it is stale. In the hind quarter, the 
same discovery may be made by examining the kidney and 
the knuckle, for the former has a slight smell, and the knuckle 
is not firm, when the meat has been killed too long. 

Pork should have a thin rind ; and when it is fresh, the 
meat is smooth and cool ; but, when it looks flabby, and is 
clammy to the touch, it is not good ; and pork, above all meat, 
is disagreeable when it is stale. If you perceive many en- 
larged glands, or, as they are usually termed, kernels, in the 
fat of the pork, you may conclude that the pork cannot be 
wholesome. 

Veal is generally preferred of a delicate whiteness, but it 
is more juicy and well-flavored when of a deeper color. 
Butchers bleed calves profusely in order to produce this white 
meat ; but this practice must certainly deprive the meat of 
some of its nourishment and flavor. When you choose veal, 
endeavor to look at the loin, which affords the best means of 
judging of the veal generally, for if the kidney, which may 
be found on the under side of one end of the loin, be deeply 
enveloped in white and firm-looking fat, the meat will cer- 
tainly be good ; and the same appearance will enable you to 
judge if it has been recently killed. The kidney is the part 
which changes the first ; and then the suet around it becomes 
soft, and the meat flabby and spotted. 

Bacon, like pork, should have a thin rind ; the fat should be 
firm, and inclined to a reddish color ; and the lean should 
firmly adhere to the bone, and have no yellow streaks in it. 
When you are purchasing a ham, have a knife stuck into it

to the bone, which, if the ham be well cured, may be drawn 
out again without having any of the meat adhering to it, and 
without your perceiving any disagreeable smell. A short 
ham is reckoned the best. 



HOW TTO SEIvECT FISH. 

TuRBOT, which is in season the greater part of the year, 
should have the underside of a yellowish white, for when it is 
very transparent, blue, or thin, it is not good ; the whole fish 
should be thick and firm. 

Salmon should have a fine red flesh and gills ; the scales 
should be bright, and the whole fish firm. Many persons 
think that salmon is improved by keeping a day or two. 

Cod should be judged by the redness of the gills, the white- 
ness, stiffness and firmness of the fiesh, and the clear fresh- 
ness of the eyes ; these are the infallible proofs of its being 
good. The whole fish should be thick and firm. 

White-Fish may be had good almost throughout the year ; 
but the time in which they are in their prime is early in the 
3^ear. The white-fish is light and delicate, and in choosing it 
you must examine whether the fins and flesh be firm. 

Fresh-Water Fish may be chosen by similar observations 
respecting the firmness of the flesh, and the clear appearance 
of the eyes, as salt-water fish. 

In a Lobster lately caught, you may put the claws in mo- 
tion by pressing the eyes ; but when it has been long caught, 
the muscular action is not excited. The freshness of boiled 
lobsters may be determined by the elasticity of the tail, which 
is flaccid when they have lost any of their wholesomeness. 
Their goodness, independent of freshness, is determined by 
their weight. 

Crabs, too, must be judged of b}'- their weight, for when 
they prove light, the flesh is generally found to be wasted 
and watery. If in perfection, the joints of the legs will be 
stiff, and the body will have an agreeable smell. The eyes, 
by a dull appearance, betray that the crab has been long 
caught. 



— 15 — 

HO\Sr TO SKIvECT POULTRY. 

In the choice of Poultry the age of the bird is the chief 
point to which you should attend. 

A young Turkey has a smooth black leg ; in an old one the 
legs are rough and reddish. If the bird be fresh killed the 
eyes will be full and fresh, and the feet moist. 

Fowls, Avhen they are young, the combs and the legs will 
be smooth, and rough when they are old. 

In Geese, when they are young, the bills and the feet are 
yellow and have a few hairs upon them, but they are red if 
the bird be old. The feet of a goose are pliable when the bird 
is fresh killed, and dry and stiff when it has been killed some 
time. Geese are called green till they are two or three 
months old. 

Ducks should be chosen by the feet, which should be supple; 
and they should also have a plump and hard breast. The feet 
of a tame duck are yellowish, those of a wild one, reddish. 

Pigeons should always be eaten while they are fresh ; when 
they look flabby and discolored about the under part, they 
have been kept too long. The feet, like those of poultry, show 
the age of the bird ; when they are supple, it is young ; when 
stiff, it is old. Tame pigeons are larger than wild ones. 



HOW TO SEIvECT GAME. 

Venison, when young, will have the fat clear and bright, 
and this ought also to be of a considerable thickness. When 
you do not wish to have it in a very high state, a knife 
plunged into either haunch or the shoulder, and drawn out, 
will by the smell enable you to judge if the venison be suffi- 
ciently fresh. 

With regard to venison, which, as it is not an everyday 
article of diet, it may be convenient to keep for some time 
after it has begun to get high or tainted, it is useful to know 
that animal putrefaction is checked by fresh burnt charcoal ; 
by means of which, therefore, the venison may be prevented 
from getting worse, although it cannot be restored to its orig- 
inal freshness. The meat should be placed in a hollow dish, 



— 16 — 

and the charcoal powder strewed over it until it covers the 
joint to the thickness of half an inch. 

Hares and Rabbits, when the ears are dry and tough, the 
haunch thick, and the claws blunt and rugged, they are old. 
Smooth and sharp claws, ears that readily tear, and a narrow 
cleft in the lip, are the marks of a young hare. Hares may 
be kept for some time after they have been killed ; indeed, 
many people think they are not fit for the table until the in- 
side begins to turn a little. Care, however, should be taken 
to prevent the inside from becoming musty, which would 
spoil the flavor of the stuffing. 

Partridges have yellow legs and a dark- colored bill when 
young. They are not in season till after the first of September. 



CARVINO, 



The seat for the carver should be somewhat elevated above 
the other chairs ; it is extremely ungraceful to carve standing, 
and it is rarely done by any person accustomed to the business. 
Carving depends more on skill than on strength. We have 
seen very small women carve admirably sitting down ; and 
very tall men who knew not how to cut a piece of beefsteak 
Avithout rising on their feet to do it. 

The carving-knife should be very sharp, and not heavy ; and 
it should be held firmly in the hand ; also the dish should be 
not too far from the carver. It is customary to help the fish 
with a fish trowel, and not with a knife. The middle part of 
a fish is generally considered the best. In helping it, avoid 
breaking the flakes, as that will give it a mangled appearance. 

In carving ribs or sirloin of beef begin by cutting thin slices 
off the side next to you. Afterward you may cut from the 
tenderloin, or cross-part near the lower end. Do not send 
anyone the outside piece, unless you know that they particu- 
larly wish it. 

In helping beefsteak put none of the bone on the plate. In 
cutting a round of corned beef begin at the top ; but lay aside 
the first cut or outside piece, and send it to no one, as it is al- 
ways dry and hard. In a round of heef a-la-mode the outside 
is frequently preferred.

In a leg of mutton begin across the middle, cutting the slices 
quite down to the bone. The same with a leg of pork or a 
ham. The latter should be cut in very thin slices, as its flavor 
is spoiled when cut thick. 

To taste well, a tongue should be cut crossways in round 
slices. Cutting it lengthwise (though the practice at many 
tables) injures the flavor. The middle part of the tongue is 
the best. Do not help anyone to a piece of the root ; that, be- 
ing by no means a favored part, is generally left in the dish. 

In carving a fore-quarter of lamb, first separate the shoulder 
part from the breast and ribs by passing the knife under, and 
then divide the ribs. If the lamb is large, have another dish 
brought to put the shoulder in. 

For a loin of veal begin near the smallest end, and separate 
the ribs ; helping a part of the kidney (as far as it will go) 
with each piece. Carve a loin of pork or mutton in the same 
manner. 

In carving a fillet of veal begin at the top. Many persons 
prefer the first cut or outside piece. Help a portion of the 
stuffing with each slice. 

In a breast of veal there are two parts very different in qual- 
ity, the ribs and the brisket. You will easily perceive the di- 
vision ; enter your knife at it and cut through, which will 
separate the two parts. Ask the person you are going to help 
whether they prefer a rib or a piece of the brisket. 

For a haunch of venison first make a deep incision by pass- 
ing your knife all along on the side, cutting quite down to the 
bone. This is to let out the gravy. Then turn the broad end 
of the haunch toward you, and cut it as deep as you can in 
thin slices, allowing some of the fat to each person. 

For a saddle of venison, or of mutton, cut from the tail to 
the other end on each side of the backbone, making very thin 
slices, and sending some fat with each. Venison and roast 
mutton chill very soon. Currant jelly is an indispensable ap- 
pendage to venison, and to roast mutton, and to ducks. 

A young pig is most generally divided before it comes to 
table, in which case it is not customary to send in the head, 
as to many persons it is a revolting spectacle after it is cut 
oft. When served up whole, first separate the head from the 
shoulders, then cut off the limbs, and then divide the ribs. 
Help some of the stuffing with each piece.

To carve a fowl, begifi by sticking your fork in the pinion, 
and drawing it towards tlie leg ; and then passing your knife 
underneath take off the wing at the joint. Next, slip your 
knife between the leg and the body, to cut througli the joint; 
and with the fork turn the leg back, and the joint will give 
way. Then take off the other wing and leg. If the fowl 
has been trussed (as it ought to be) with the liver and giz- 
zard, help the liver with one wing, and the gizzard with 
the other. The liver-wing is considered the best. After 
the limbs are taken off enter your knife into the top of 
the breast, and cut under the merry-tliought, so as to loosen it, 
lifting it with your fork. Afterward cut slices from both 
sides of the breast. Next take off the collar-bones, which lie 
on each side of the merry-thought, and then separate the side- 
bones from the back. The breast and wings are considered 
as the most delicate parts of the fowl ; the back, as the least 
desirable, is generally left in the dish. Some persons, in carv- 
ing a fowl, find it more convenient to take it on a plate, and 
as they separate it return each part to the dish ; but this is not 
the usual way. 

A turkey is carved in the same manner as a fowl ; except 
that the legs and wings, being larger, are separated at the 
lower joint. The lower part of the leg (or drumstick, as it is 
called), being hard, tough, and stringy, is never helped to any 
one, but allowed to remain on the dish. First cut off the wing, 
leg, and breast from one side ; then turn the turkey over, and 
cut them off from the other. 

To carve a goose, separate the leg from the body, by putting 
the fork into the small end of the limb ; pressing it close to 
the body, and then passing the knife under, and turning the 
leg back, as you cut through the joint. To take off the wing, 
put your fork into the small end of the pinion, and press it 
closely to the body ; then slip the knife under, and separate 
the joint. Next cut under the merry-thought, and take it off ; 
and then cut slices from the breast. Then turn the goose, and 
dismember the other side. Take off the two upper side-bones 
that are next to the wings, and then the two lower side-bones. 
The breast and legs of a goose afford the finest pieces. If a 
goose is old there is no fowl so tough ; and, if difficult to carve, 
it will be still more difficult to eat. 

Partridges, pheasants, grouse, etc., are carved in the same 



— 19 — 

manner as fowls. Quails, woodcocks, and snipes are merely- 
split down the back ; so also are pigeons, giving a half to each 
person. 

In helping any one to gravy, or to melted butter, do not pour 
it over their meat, fowl or fish, but put it to one side on a va- 
cant part of the plate, that they may use just as much of it as 
they like. In filling a plate never heap one thing on another. 

In helping vegetables, do not plunge the spoon down to the 
bottom of the dish, in case they should not have been per- 
fectly well drained, and the water should have settled there. 

By observing carefully how it is done you may acquire a 
knowledge of the joints, and of the process of carving, which 
a little daily practice will soon convert into dexterity. If a 
young lady is ignorant of this very useful art, it will be well 
for her to take lessons of her father, or her brother, and a mar- 
ried lady can easily learn from her husband. Domestics who 
wait at table may soon, from looking on daily, become so ex- 
pert that, when necessary, they can take a dish to the side- 
table and carve it perfectl}^ well. 

At a dinner-party, if the hostess is quite young, she is fre- 
quently glad to be relieved of the trouble of carving by the 
gentleman who sits nearest to her; but if she is familiar with 
the business she usually prefers doing it herself.

SOUF»S. 



GENERA.Iv REIVIARKS. 



Be careful to proportion the quantity of water to that of the 
meat. Somewhat less than a quart of water to a pound of 
meat is a good rule for common soups. Rich soups, intended 
for company, may have a still smaller allowance of water. 

Soup should always be made entirely of fresh meat that has 
not been previously cooked. An exception to this rule may 
sometimes be made in favor of the remains of a piece of roast 
beef that has been very much under-done in roasting. This 
may be added to a good piece of raw meat. Cold ham, also, 
may be occasionally put into white soups. 

Soup, however, that has been originally made of raw meat 
entirely is frequently better the second day than the first, j^ro- 
vided that it is reboiled only for a very short time, and that 
no additional water is added to it. 

Unless it has been allowed to boil too hard, so as to exhaust 
the water, the soup-pot will not require replenishing. When 
it is found absolutely necessary to do so, the additional water 
must be boiling-hot when poured in ; if lukewarm or cold, it 
will entirely spoil the soup. 

Every particle of fat should be carefully skimmed from the 
surface. Greasy soup is disgusting and unwholesome. The 
lean of meat is much better for soup than the fat. 

Long and slow boiling is necessary to extract the strength 
from the meat. If boiled fast over a large fire the meat be- 
comes hard and tough, and will not give out its juices. 

Potatoes, if boiled in the soup, are thought by some to ren- 
der it unwholesome, from the opinion that the water in which 
potatoes have been cooked is alniost a poison. As potatoes 
are a part of every dinner, it is very easy to take a few out of 
the pot in which they have been boiled by themselves, and to 
cut them up and add them to the soup just before it goes to 
table. Remove all shreds of meat and bone. 

The cook should season the soup but very slightly with salt 
and pepper. If she puts in too much it may spoil it for the 



— 21 — 

taste of most of those who are to eat it ; but if too little, it is 
easy to add more to your own plate. 

Stock. — Four pounds of shin of beef, or four pounds of 
knuckle of veal, or two pounds of each ; any bones, trimmings 
of poultiy, or fresh meat, quarter-pound of lean bacon or ham, 
two ounces of butter, two large onions, each stuck with cloves ; 
one turnip, three carrots, one head of celery, three lumps of 
sugar, two ounces of salt, half a teaspoonful of whole pepper, 
one large blade of mace, one bunch of savory herbs, four 
quarts and a half-pint of cold water. 

Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three 
inches square ; rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan ; 
put in half a pint of water, the meat, and all the other ingre- 
dients. Cover the stewpan, and place it on a sharp fire, occa- 
sionally stirring its contents. When the bottom of the pan 
becomes covered with a pale, jelly-like substance, add the four 
quarts of cold water, and simmer very gently for five hours. 
As we have said before, do not let it boil quickly. Remove 
every particle of scum while it is doing, and strain it through 
a fine hair sieve. 

This stock is the basis of many of the soups afterward men- 
tioned, and will be found quite strong enough for ordinary pur- 
poses. 

Time : five and one-half hours. Average cost, twenty-five 
cents per quart. 

White Stock Soup. — Six pounds knuckle of veal, half 
pound lean bacon, two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed in one 
of flour, two onions, two carrots two turnips, three cloves 
stuck in a:i onion, one blade of mace, bunch of herbs, six 
quarts of water, pepper and salt, one cup of boiling milk. 

Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Slice carrots, turnips, 
and one onion, leaving that with the cloves whole. Put on 
with mace, and all the herbs except the parsley, in two quarts 
of cold water. Bring to a slow boil ; take off the scum, as it 
rises, and at tlie end of an hour's stewing, add the rest of the 
cold water — one gallon. Cover and cook steadily, always 
gently, four hours. Strain off the liquor, of which there should 
be about five quarts ; rub the vegetables through the colander, 
and pick out bones and meat. Season these highly and put, 
as is your Saturday custom, into a wide-mouthed jar, or a 



— 22 — 

large bowl. Add to them three quarts of stock, well salted, 
and, wlien cold keep on ice. Cool to-day's stock ; remove the 
fat, season, put in chopped parsley, and put over the fire. 
Heat in a saucepan a cup of milk, stir in the floured butter ; 
cook three minutes. When the soup has simmered ten min- 
utes after the last boil, and been carefully skimmed, pour into 
the tureen, and stir in the hot, thickened milk. 

Shin of Beef Soup. — Get a shin-bone of beef weighing four 
or five pounds ; let the butcher saw it in pieces about two 
inches long, that the marrow ma}^ become the better incorpo- 
rated with the soup, and so give it greater richness. 

Wash the meat in cold water ; mix together of salt and pep- 
per each a tablespoonful, rub this well into the meat, then put 
into a soup-pot ; put to it as many quarts of water as there are 
pounds of meat, and set it over a moderate fire, until it comes 
to a boil, then take off whatever scum may have risen, after 
which cover it close, and set it where it will boil very gently 
for two hours longer, then skim ^it again, and add to it the 
proper vegetables which are these — one large carrot grated, 
one large turnip cut in slices (the yellow or ruta baga is best), 
one leek cut in slices, one bunch of parsley cut small, six 
small potatoes peeled and cut in half, and a teacupful of pearl 
barley well washed, then cover it and let it boil gently for one 
hour, at which time add another tablespoonful of salt and a 
thickening made of a tablespoonful of wheat flour and a gill 
of water, stir it in by the spoonful ; cover it for fifteen min- 
utes and it is done. 

Three hours and a half is required to make this soup ; it is 
the best for cold weather. Should any remain over the first 
day, it may be heated with the addition of a little boiling 
water, and served again. 

Take the meat from the soup, and if to be served with it, 
take out the bones, and lay it closely and neatly on a dish, and 
garnish with sprigs of parsley ; serve made mustard and cat- 
sup with it. It is very nice pressed and eaten with mustard 
and vinegar or catsup. 

Mutton Soup with Tapioca.— Three pounds perfectly lean 
mutton. The scrag makes good soup and costs little. Two 
or three pounds of bones, well pounded, one onion, two tur- 
nips, two carrots, two stalks of celery, a few sprigs of parsley; 



— 23 — 

if you have any tomatoes left from yesterday, add them, four 
tablespoonfuls of pearl or granulated tapioca (not heaping 
spoonfuls), four quarts of water. 

Put on the meat, cut in small pieces, with the bones, in two 
quarts of cold water. Heat very slowly, and when it boils 
pour in two quarts of hot water from the kettle. Chop the 
vegetables ; cover with cold water. So soon as they begin to 
simmer, throw off the first water, replenishing with hot, and 
stew until they are boiled to pieces. The meat should cook 
steadily, never fast, five hours, keeping the pot-lid on. Strain 
into a great bowl ; let it cool to throw the fat to the surface ; 
skim and return to the fire. Season with pepper and salt, boil 
up, take off the scum ; add the vegetables with their liquor. 
Heat together ten minutes, strain again, and bring to a slow 
boil before the tapioca goes in. This should have been soaked 
one hour in cold water, then cooked in the same within an- 
other vessel of boiling water until each grain is clear. It is 
necessary to stir up often from the bottom while cooking. 
Stir gradually into the soup until the tapioca is dissolved. 

Send around grated cheese with this soup. 

Veal Soup.— To about three pounds of a joint of veal, which 
must be well broken up, put four quarts of water and set it 
over to boil. Prepare one-fourth pound of macaroni by boil- 
ing it by itself, with sufficient water to cover it ; add a little 
butter to the macaroni when it is tender, strain the soup and 
season to taste with salt and pepper, then add the macaroni 
in the water in which it is boiled. The addition of a pint of 
rich milk or cream and celery flavor is relished by many. 

Ox-Tail Soup. — Take two ox-tails and two whole onions, 
two carrots, a small turnip, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and a 
little white pepper, add a gallon of water, let all boil for two 
hours ; then take out the tails and cut the meat into small 
pieces, return the bones to the pot, for a short time, boil for 
another hour, then strain the soup, and rinse two spoonfuls of 
arrowroot to add to it with the meat cut from the bones, and 
let all boil for a quarter of an hour. 

Vegetable Soup. — Two pounds of coarse, lean beef, cut into 
strips, two pounds of knuckle of veal, chopped to pieces, two 
pounds of mutton bones, and the bones left from your cold 
veal, cracked to splinters, one pound of lean ham, four large 



— 24 — 

carrots, two turnips, two onions, bunch of herbs, three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, and two of flour, one tablespoonful of 
sugar, salt and pepper, seven quarts of water. 

Put on meat, bones, herbs and water, and cook slowly five 
hours. Strain the soup, of which there should be five quarts. 
Season meat and bones, and put into the stock-pot with three 
quarts of the liquor. Save this for days to come. While the 
soup for to-day is cooling that you may take off the fat, put 
the butter into a frying-pan with the sliced carrots, turnips, 
and onions, and fry to a light brown. Now, add a pint of the 
skimmed stock, and stew the vegetables tender, stir in the 
flour wet with water, and put all, with your cooled stock, over 
the fire in the soup-kettle. Season with sugar, cayenne and 
salt, boil five minutes, rub through a colander, then a soup- 
sieve, heat almost to boiling, and serve. 

Macaroni Soup. — To a rich beef or other soup, in which 
there is no seasoning other than pepper or salt, take half a 
pound of small jDipe macaroni, boil it in clear water until it is 
tender, then drain it and cut it in pieces of an inch length, 
boil it for fifteen minutes in the soup and serve. 

Vermicelli Soup. — Swell quarter of a pound of vermicelli 
in a quart of warm water, then add it to a good beef, veal, 
lamb, or chicken soup or broth with quarter of a pound of 
sweet butter ; let the soup boil for fifteen minutes after it is 
added. 

Chicken Cream Soup. — Boil an old fowl, with an onion, in 
four quarts of cold water, until there remain but two quarts. 
Take it out and let it get cold. Cut off the whole of the breast, 
and chop very fine. Mix with the pounded yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs, and rub through a colander. Cool, skim, and 
strain the soup into a soup-pot. Season, add the chicken-and- 
egg mixture, simmer ten minutes, and pour into the tureen. 
Then add a small cup of boiling milk. 

Mock-Turtle Soup. — Clean and wash a calf's head, split it 
in two, save the brains, boil the head until tender in plenty of 
water ; put a slice of fat ham, a bunch of parsley cut small, a 
sprig of thyme, two leeks cut small, six cloves, a teaspoonful 
of pepper, and three ounces of butter, into a stew-pan, and 
fry them a nice brown ; then add the water in which the 
head was boiled, cut the meat from the head in neat square 



— 25 — 

pieces and put them to the soup ; add a pint of Madeira and 
one lemon sliced thin, add cayenne pepper and salt to taste ; 
let it simmer gently for two hours, then skim it clear and 

serve. 

Make a forcemeat of the brains as follows : put them in a 
stew-pan, pour hot water over, and set it over the fire for a 
few minutes, then take them up, chop them small, with a sprig- 
of parsley, a saltspoonful of salt and pepper each, a table- 
spoonful of wheat flour, the same of butter, and one well- 
beaten egg ; make it in small balls, and drop them in the soup 
fifteen minutes before it is taken from the fire ; in making 
the balls, a little more flour may be necessary. Egg -balls 
may also be added. 

Hard Pea Soup. — Many persons keep the bones of their 
roasts in order to convert them into stock for pea soup, which 
is, to my taste, one of the most relishable of all soups, and a 
famous dish for cold weather, with this advantage in its favor, 
that it may be made from almost anything. Capital stock for 
pea soup can be made from a knuckle of ham or from a piece 
of pickled pork. Supposing that some such stock is at hand 
to the extent of about two quarts, procure, say, two pounds of 
split peas, wash them well, and then soak them for a night in 
water to which a very little piece of soda has been added (the 
floating peas should be all thrown away), strain out the peas 
and place them in the stock, adding a head of celery, a cut- 
down carrot, and a large onion or two, and season with a 
pinch of curry powder, or half an eggspoonful of cayenne 
pepper. Boil with a lid on the pot till all is soft, skimming 
off the scum occasionally, and then carefully strain into a 
well- warmed tureen, beating the pulp through the strainer 
with a spoon. Serve as hot as possible, placing a breakfast- 
cupful of crumbled toast (bread) into the tureen before the 
soup is dished. Much of the success in preparing this soup 
lies in the "straining," which ought to be carefully attended 
to. A wire sieve is best ; but an active housewife must never 
stick. If she has not a sieve made for the purpose, she can 
fold a piece of net two or three times, and use that. When a 
knuckle of ham has been used to make the stock it should 
form a part of the dinner, with potatoes ; or it may be used 
as a breakfast or supper relish.

Green Pea Soup.— Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold 
water, and put it into a soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; 
add to it two tablespoonf uls of salt, and set it over a moderate 
fii-e—let it boil gently for two hours, then skim it clear ; add a 
quart of shelled peas, and a teaspoonf ul of pepper ; cover it, 
and let it boil for half an hour, then having scraped the skins 
from a quart of small young potatoes, add them to the soup , 
cover the pot, and let it boil for half an hour longer ; work 
quarter of a pound of butter, and a dessert spoonful of flour 
together, and add them to the soup ten or twelve minutes be- 
fore taking it off the fire. 

Serve the meat on a dish with parsley sauce over, and the 
soup in a tureen. 

Potato Soup.— Potato soup is suitable for a cold day. Make 
it in the following manner: Get as many beef or ham bones 
as you can, and smash them into fragments. Add a little bit 
of lean ham to give flavor. Boil the bone and ham for two 
hours and a half at least. The bone of a roast beef is excel- 
lent. Strain off the liquor carefully, empty out the bones and 
debris of the ham, restore the liquor to the pot, and place again 
on the fire. Having selected, washed, and pared some nice 
potatoes, cut them into small pieces, and boil them in the stock 
till they melt away. An onion or two may also be boiled 
among the bones to help the flavor. I do not like thick po- 
tato s'oup, and I usually strain it through a hair sieve, after 
doing so placing it again on the fire, seasoning it with pepper 
and salt to taste. A stick of celery boiled with the bones is 
an improvement. Make only the quantity required for the 
day, as potato soup is best when it is newly made. 

Tomato Soup.— Tomato soup is a much relished American 
dish, and is prepared as follows: Steam, or rather stew slowly, 
a mess of turnips, carrots, and onions, also a stock of celery, 
with half a pound of lean ham and a little hit of fresh butter 
over a slow fire for an hour or so. Then add two quarts of 
diluted stock or of other liquor in which meat has been boiled, 
as also eight or ten ripe tomatoes. Stew the whole for an 
hour and "a half, then pass through the sieve into the pan 
again ; add a little pepper and salt, boil for ten minutes and 
serve hot. This soup may, on an emergency, be made from 
tomato sauce or canned tomatoes. Put thin toasted bread 



— 27 — 

cut in dice into the soup, if approved, as it is being dished. 
Serve very hot. 

Plain Calf s Head Soup. — Take a calf's head well cleaned, 
a knuckle of veal, and put them both into a large kettle ; put 
one onion and a large tablespoon of sweet herbs, into a cloth 
and into the kettle, with the meat, over which you have poured 
about four quarts of water. If you wish the soup for a one 
o'clock dinner, put the meat over to boil as early as eight 
o'clock in the morning ; let it boil steadily and slowly and 
season well with salt and pepper. About one hour before 
serving, take off the soup and pour it through a colander, pick 
out all the meat carefully, chop very fine and return to the 
soup, putting it again over the fire. Boil four eggs very hard, 
chop them fine, and slice one lemon very thin, adding at the 
very last. 

Soup a la Julienne. — Half pint of carrots, half pint of tur- 
nips, quarter of a pint of onions, two or three leeks, half a hgad 
of celery, one lettuce, a little sorrel and chervil, if Ijked, two 
ounces of butter, two quarts of stock. 

Cut the vegetables into strips of about one and a quarter 
inches long, and be particular they are all the same size, or 
some will be hard whilst the others will be done to a pulp. 
Cut the lettuce, sorrel and chervil into larger pieces ; fry the 
carrots in the butter, and pour the stock boiling to them. 
When this is done, add all the other vegetables, and herbs, 
and stew gently for at least an hour. Skim off all the fat, 
pour the soup over thin slices of bread, cut round, about the 
size of a quarter -dollar, and serve. 

Game Soup. — Two grouse or partridges, or, if you have 
neither, use a pair of rabbits ; half a pound of lean ham ; two 
medium-sized onions ; one pound of lean beef ; fried bread ; 
butter for frying ; pepper, salt, and two stalks of white celery 
cut into inch lengths ; three quarts of water. 

Joint your game neatly ; cut the ham and onions into small 
pieces, and fry all in butter to a light brown. Put into a 
soup-pot with the beef, cut into strips, and a little pepper. 
Pour on the water ; heat slowly, and stew gently two hours. 
Take out the pieces of bird, and cover in a bowl ; cook the 
soup an hour longer ; strain ; cool ; drop in the celery, and 
simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried bread in the tureen. 



— 28 — 



Celery Soup.— Celery soup may be made with ichite stock. 
Cut down the white of half a dozen heads of celery into little 
pieces and boil it in four pints of white stock, with a quarter 
of a pound of lean ham and two ounces of butter. Simmer 
gently for a full hour, then drain through a sieve, return the 
liquor to pan and stir in a few spoonfuls of cream with great 
care. Serve with toasted bread, and, if liked, thicken with a 
little flour. Season to taste. 

Oyster Soup.— Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, one teacupful hot water ; pep- 
per, salt. , 
Strain all the liquor from the oysters ; add the water, and 
heat When near the boil, add the seasoning, then, the 
oysters. Cook about five minutes from the time they begin 
to simmer, until they "ruffle." Stir in the butter, cook one 
minute and pour into the tureen. Stir in the boiling milk, 
and send to table. 

Lobster Soup.— Procure a large hen fish, boiled, and with 
all its coral, if possible. Cut away from it all the meat in neat 
little pieces ; beat up the fins and minor claws in a mortar, 
then stew the results in a stew-pan, slowly, along with a little 
white stock ; season this with a bunch of sweet herbs; a small 
onion, a little bit of celery, and a carrot may be placed in the 
stock, as also the toasted crust of a French roll. Season to 
taste with salt and a little cayenne. Simmer the whole for 
about an hour ; then strain and return the liquor to the sauce- 
pan, place in it the pieces of lobster, and having beat up the 
coral in a little flour and gravy, stir it in. Let the soup re- 
main on the fire for a few minutes without boiling and serve 
hot. A small strip of the rind of a lemon may be boiled in 
the stock, and a little nutmeg may be added to the seasoning. 
This is a troublesome soup to prepare, but there are many 
who like it when it is well made. 

Egg Balls for Soup.— Boil four eggs ; put into cold water ; 
mash yolks with yolk of one raw egg ; and one teaspoonful 
of flour, pepper, salt and parsley ; make into balls and boil 
two minutes. 

Noodles for Soup.— Rub into two eggs as much sifted flour 
as they will absorb ; then roll out until thin as a wafer : dust 
over a little flour, and then roll over and over in a roll, cut off 



— 29 — 

thin slices from the edge of -the roll and shake out into long 
strips ; put them into the soup lightly and boil for ten min- 
utes ; salt should be added while mixing with the flour — 
about a saltspoonful. 

Irish Stew. — Stoved Potatoes. — These form excellent and 
nutritious dishes. The former dish can be made from a por- 
tion of the back ribs or neck of mutton, the fleshy part of 
wliich must be cut into cutlets. Flatten these pieces of meat 
with a roller, and dip them in a composition of pepper, salt, 
and flour. Peel potatoes and slice them to the extent of two 
pounds of potatoes for every pound of meat. An onion or two 
sliced into small bits will be required. Before building the 
materials into a goblet, melt a little suet or dripping in it, then 
commence by laying in the pot a layer of potatoes, which dust 
well with pepper and salt, then a layer of the meat sprinkled 
with the chopped onion, and so on till the goblet is pretty full. 
Fill in about a breakfast cupful of gravy, if there be any in 
the house ; if not, water will do. Finish off with a treble row 
of potatoes on the top. Let the mess stew slowly for about 
three hours, taking great care to keep the lid so tight that 
none of the virtue can escape — letting away the steam is just 
letting away the flavor. Shake the pot occasionally with some 
force, to prevent burning. Some cooks, in preparing this dish, 
boil the potatoes for some time, and then pour and dry them 
well ; others add a portion of kidney to the stew ; while ex- 
travagant people throw in a few oysters, a slice or two of lean 
ham, or a ham shank. Irish stew should be served as hot as 
possible. — Stoved potatoes are prepared much in the same 
way. Cut down what of the Sunday's roast is left, and pro- 
ceed with it just as you would with the neck of mutton. Some 
cooks would stew the bones of the roast, in order to make a 
gravy in wliich to stove the meat and potatoes, but the bones 
will make excellent potato soup. 

To get up a Soup in Haste. — Chop some cold cooked meat 
fine, and put a pint into a stew-pan with some gravy, season 
with pepper and salt, and a little butter if the gravy is not 
rich, add a little flour moistened with cold water, and three 
pints boiling water, boiled moderately half an hour. Strain 
over some rice or nicely toasted bread, and serve. Uncooked 
meat may be used by using one quart of cold water to a pound

of chopped meat, and letting it stand half before boiling-. 
Celery root may be grated in as seasoning, or a bunch of 
parsley thrown in. 

To Color Soups. — A fine amber color is obtained by adding 
finely-grated carrot to the clear stock when it is quite free 
from scum. 

Red is obtained by using red skinned tomatoes from which 
the skin and seeds have been strained out. 

Only white vegetables should be used in white soups, as 
chicken. 

Spinach leaves, pounded in a mortar, and the juice expressed 
and added to the soups, will give a green color. 

Black beans make an excellent brown soup. The same color 
can be gotten by adding burnt sugar or browned flour to clear 
stock. 



FISH, 



Fish are good, when the gills are red, eyes are full, and the 
body of the fish is firm and stiff. After washing them well, 
they should be allowed to remain for a short time in salt water 
sufficient to cover them ; before cooking, wipe them dry ; 
dredge lightly with flour, and season with salt and pepper. 
Salmon-trout and other small fish are usually fried or broiled; 
all large fish should be put in a cloth, tied closely with twine, 
and placed in cold water, when they may be put over the fire 
to boil. When fish are b.iked, prepare the fish the same as for 
boiling, and put in the oven on a wire gridiron, over a drip- 
ping-pan. 

Boiled Salmon. — The middle slice of salmon is the best. 
Sew up neatly in a mosquito-net bag, and boil a quarter of an 
hour to the pound in hot, salted water. When done, unwrap 
with care, and lay upon a hot dish, taking care not to break 
it. Have ready a large cupful of drawn butter, very rich, in 
which has been stirred a tablespoonful of minced parsle}" and 
the juice of a lemon. Pour half upon the salmon, and serve 
the rest in a boat. Garnish with parsley and sliced egg. 

Here is a recipe for a nice pickle for cold salmon made of the 
liquor in which the fish has been boiled, of wliich take as 
mucli as you wish, say three breakfast cupfuls, to which add

vinegar to taste (perhaps a teacupful will be enough), a good 
pinch of pepper, a dessert spoonful of salt Boil for a few 
minutes with a sprig or two of parsley and a little thyme. 
After it has become quite cold, pour it over the fish. 

Broiled Salmon.— Cut some slices about an inch thick, and 
broil them over a gentle, bright fire of coals, for ten or twelve 
minutes. When both sides are done, take them on to a hot 
dish ; butter each slice well with sweet butter; strew over 
each a very little salt and pepper to taste, and serve. 

Baked Salmon. — Clean the fish, rinse it, and wipe it dry ; 
rub it well outside and in with a mixture of pepper and salt, 
and fill it with a stuffing made of slices of bread, buttered 
freely and moistened with hot milk or water (add sage or 
thyme to the seasoning if liked) ; tie a thread around the fish, 
so as to keep the stuffing in (take off the thread before serv- 
ing) ; lay muffin-rings, or a trivet in a dripping-pan, lay bits 
of butter over the fish, dredge flour over, and put it on the 
rings ; put a pint of hot water in the pan, to baste with; bake 
one hour if a large fish, in a quick oven ; baste frequently. 
When the fish is taken up, having cut a lemon in very thin 
slices, put them in the pan, and let them fry a little ; then 
dredge in a teaspoonf ul of wheat flour ; add a small bit of but- 
ter ; stir it about, and let it brown without burning for a little 
while ; then add half a teacup or more of boiling water, stir it 
smooth, take the slices of lemon into the gravy-boat, and strain 
the gravy over. Serve with boiled potatoes. The lemon may 
be omitted if preferred, although generally it will be liked. 

Salmon-Trout. — Dressed the same as salmon. 

Spiced Salmon (Pickled). — Boil a salmon, and after wiping 
it dry set it to cool ; take of the water in which it was boiled, 
and good vinegaj" each equal parts, enough to cover it ; add to 
it one dozen cloves, as many small blades of mace, or sliced 
nutmeg, one teaspoonful of whole pepper, and the same of 
alspice ; make it boiling hot, skim it clear, add a small bit of 
butter (the size of a small egg), and pour it over the fish ; set 
it in a cool place. When cold, it is fit for use. and will keep 
for a long time, covered close, in a cool place. Serve instead 
of pickled oysters for supper. 

A fresh cod is very nice, done in the same manner ; as is 
also a striped sea bass. 



— 32 — 

Salmon and Caper Sauce. — Two slices of salmon, one- 
quarter pound butter, one half teaspoonf ul of chopped parsley, 
one shalot ; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste. 

Mode : Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of 
butter over it, and add the other ingredients, rubbing a little 
of the seasoning into the fish ; baste it frequently ; when 
done, take it out and drain for a minute or two ; lay it in a 
dish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve. Salmon dressed in 
this way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious 

Salmon Cutlets. — Cut the slices one inch thick, and season 
them with pepper and salt ; butter a sheet of white paper, 
lay each slice on a separate piece, with their ends twisted ; 
broil gently over a clear fire, and serve with anchovy or caper 
sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a few chopped 
herbs and a little spice. 

Dried or Smoked Salmon.— Cut the fish down the back, 
take out the entrails, and roe, scale it, and rub the outside and 
in with common salt, and hang it to drain for twenty-four 
hours. 

Pound three ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of coarse salt, 
and two of coarse brown sugar ; mix these well together, and 
rub the salmon over every part with it ; then lay it on a large 
dish for two days ; then rub it over with common salt, and in 
twenty-four hours it will be fit to dry. Wipe it well, stretch 
it open with two sticks, and hang it in a chimney, with a 
smothered wood-fire, or in a smoke-house, or in a dry, cool 
place. 

Shad done in this manner are very fine. 

Boiled Cod — Lay the fish in cold water, a little salt, for 
half an hour. Wipe dry, and sew up in a linen cloth, coarse 
and clean, fitted to the shape of the piece of cod. Have but 
one fold over each part. Lay in the fish-kettle, cover with 
boiling water, salted at discretion. Allow nearly an hour for 
a piece weighing four pounds. 

Cod Pie. — Any remains of cold cod, twelve oysters, sufficient 
melted butter to moisten it ; mashed potatoes enough to fill 
up the dish. 

Mode: Flake the fish from the bone, and carefully take 
away all the skin. Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over the melted 
butter and oysters (or oyster sauce, if there is any left), and 



— 33 — 

cover with mashed potatoes. Bake for half an hour, and send 
to table of a nice brown color. 

Cousin Kate's Recipe for Codfish Balls, or Croquettes. — 

Two parts mashed potatoes, one part shredded codfish, large 
lump butter, a little warm milk and pepper to taste. Satu- 
rate (do not soak) the shredded codfish with cold water to re- 
move salt to taste, and squeeze in a linen cloth, melt the but- 
ter in the hot potato, add the fish, milk and pepper, beat very 
hard and light with a fork until perfectly smooth, make into 
balls, drop in hot lard like doughnuts, or fry in hot lard in 
the spider. 

Dried Codfish. - This should always be laid in soak at least 
one night before it is wanted ; then take off the skin and 
put it in plenty of cold water : boil it gently (skimming it 
meanwhile) for one hour, or tie it in a cloth and boil it. 

Serve with egg sauce ; garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
slices, and sprigs of parsley. Serve plain boiled or mashed 
potatoes with it. 

Stewed Salt Cod. — Scald some soaked cod by putting it 
over the fire in boiling water for ten minutes ; then scrape it 
white, pick it in flakes, and put it in a stew-pan, with a table- 
spoonful of butter worked into the same of flour, and as much 
milk as will moisten it ; let it stew gently for ten minutes ; 
add pepper to taste, and serve hot ; put it in a deep dish, slice 
hard-boiled eggs over, and sprigs of parsley around the edge. 

This is a nice relish for breakfast, with coffee and tea, and 
rolls or toast. 

Codfish Cakes. — First boil soaked cod, then chop it fine, 
put to it an equal quantity of potatoes boiled and mashed ; 
moisted it with beaten eggs or milk, and a bit of butter and a 
little pepper ; form it in small, round cakes, rather more than 
half an inch thick ; flour the outside, and fry in hot lard or 
beef drippings until they are a delicate brown ; like fish, these 
must be fried gently, the lard being boiling hot when they 
are put in ; when one side is done turn the other. Serve for 
breakfast. 

Boiled Bass. — Put enough water in the pot for the fish to 
swim in, easily. Add half a cup of vinegar, a teaspoonful of 
salt, an onion, a dozen black peppers, and a blade of mace. 
Sew up the fish in a piece of clean net, fitted to its shape. 



— 34 — 

Heat slowly for the first half hour, then boil eight minutes, at 
least, to the pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and pour over it a 
cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor in which the fish 
was boiled, with the juice of half a lemon stirred into it. 
Garnish with sliced lemon. 

Fried Bass. — Clean, wipe dry, inside and out, dredge with 
flour, and season with salt. Fry in hot butter, beef-dripping, 
or sweet lard. Half butter half lard is a good mixture for 
frying fish. The moment the fish are done to a good brown, 
take them from the fat and drain in a hot colander. Garnish 
with parsley. 

To Fry or Broil Fish Properly. — After the fish is well 
cleansed, lay it on a folded towel and dry out all the water. 
When well wiped and dry, roll it in wheat flour, rolled crack- 
ers, grated stale bread, or Indian meal, whichever may be pre- 
ferred ; wheat flour will generally be liked. 

Have a thick-bottomed frying-pan or spider, with plenty of 
sweet lard salted (a tablespoonful of salt to each pound of 
lard), for fresh fish which have not been previously salted ; 
let it become boiling hot, then lay the fish in and let it fry 
gently, until one side is a fine delicate brown, then turn the 
other ; when both are done, take it up carefully and serve 
quickly, or keep it covered with a tin cover, and set the dish 
where it will keep hot. 

Baked Black Bass. — Eight good-sized onions chopped fine: 
half that quantity of bread-crumbs ; butter size of hen's egg ; 
plenty of pepper and salt, mix thoroughly with anchovy sauce 
until quite red. Stuff your fish with this compound and pour 
the rest over it, previously sprinkling it with a little red pep- 
per. Shad, pickerel, and trout are good the same way. To- 
matoes can be used instead of anchovies, and are more eco- 
nomical. If using them take pork in place of butter and chop 
fine. 

Broiled Mackerel. — Pepper and salt to taste, a small quan- 
tity of oil. Mackerel should never be washed when intended 
to be broiled, but merely wiped very clean and dr}^, after 
taking out the gills and inside. Open the back, and put in a 
little pepper, salt, and oil ; broil it over a clear fire, turn it over 
on both sides, and also on the back. When sufficiently cooked, 
the flesh can be detached from the bone, which will be in about 



— 35 — 

ten minutes for a small mackerel. Chop a little parsley, work 
it up in the butter, with pepper and salt to taste, and a squeeze 
of lemon-juice, and put it in the back. Serve before the butter 
is quite melted. 

Mackerel baked will be found palatable. Clean and trim 
the fish nicely, say four large ones, or half a dozen small ones, 
bone them and lay neatly in a baking dish, or a bed of potato 
chips well dusted with a mixture of pepper and salt ; on the 
potatoes, place a few pieces of butter. Dust the fish sepa- 
rately with pepper and salt, and sprinkle slightly with a di- 
luted mixture of anchovy sauce and catsup. Bake three quar- 
ters of an hour. 

Salt Mackerel, with Cream Sauce.— Soak overnight in 
lukewarm water, changing this in the morning for ice-cold. 
Rub all the salt off, and wipe dry. Grease your gridiron with 
butter, and rub the fish on both sides with the same, melted. 
Then broil quickly over a clear fire, turning with a cake- 
turner so as not to break it. Lay upon a hot water dish, and 
cover until the sauce is ready. 

Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a teaspoon- 
ful of corn-starch wet up with a little water. When this 
thickens, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper, salt and 
chopped parsley. Beat an egg light, pour the sauce gradually 
over it, put the mixture again over the fire, and stir one min- 
ute, not more. Pour upon the fish, and let all stand, covered, 
over the hot water in the chafing-dish. Put fresh boiling wa- 
ter under the dish before sending to table. 

Boiled Eels. — Four small eels, sufficient water to cover 
them ; a large bunch of parsley. 

Choose small eels for boiling ; put them in a stewpan with 
the parsley, and just sufficient water to cover them ; simmer 
till tender. Take them out, pour a little parsley and butter 
over them, and serve some in a tureen. 

Fricaseed Eels. — After skinning, cleaning, and cutting five 
or six eels in pieces of two inches in length, boil them in water 
nearly to cover them, until tender ; then add a good-sized bit 
of butter, with a teaspoonful of wheat fiour or rolled cracker 
worked into it, and a little scalded and chopped parsley ; add 
salt and pepper to taste, and a wine-glass of vinegar if liked : 
let them simmer for ten minutes and serve hot. 



— 36 — 

Fried Eels. — After cleaning- the"eel§ well, cut them in 
pieces two inches long ; wash them and wipe them dry ; roll 
them in wheat flour or rolled cracker, and fry as directed for 
other fish, in hot lard or beef dripping, salted. They should 
be browned all over and thoroughly done. 

Eels may be prepared in the same manner and broiled. 

Collared Eels. — One large eel ; pepper and salt to taste ; 
two blades of mace, two cloves, a little allspice very finely 
pounded, six leaves of sage, and a small bunch of herbs 
minced very small. 

Mode : Bone the eel and skin it; split it, and sprinkle it over 
with the ingredients, taking care that the spices are very finely 
pounded, and the herbs chopped very small. Roll it up and 
bind with a broad piece of tape, and boil it in water, mixed 
with a little salt and vinegar, till tender. It may either be 
served whole or cut in slices ; and when cold, the eel should 
be kept in the liquor it was boiled in, but with a little more 
vinegar put to it. 

Fried Trout. — They must, of course, be nicely cleaned and 
trimmed all round, but do not cut off their heads. Dredge 
them well with flour, and fry in a pan of boiling hot fat or oil. 
Turn them from side to side till they are nicely browned, and 
quite ready. Drain off all the fat before sending the fish to 
table ; garnish with a few sprigs of parsley, and provide plain 
melted butter. If preferred, the trout can be larded with 
beaten egg, and be then dipped in bread-crumbs. The frying 
will occupy from five to eight minutes, according to size. 
Very large trout can be cut in pieces. 

Trout in Jelly (or other fish).— This is a beautiful supper 
dish, and may be arranged as follows : Turn the fish into 
rings, with tail in mouth. Prepare a seasoned water in which 
to boil the trout ; the water should have a little vinegar and 
salt in it, and maybefiavored with a shallot, or a clove of gar- 
lic. When the water is cold, place the trout in, and boil them 
very gently, so as not hash or break them. When done, lift 
out and drain. Baste with fish jelly, for which a recipe is 
given elsewhere, coat after coat, as each coat hardens. Ar- 
range neatly, and serve. 

Boiled Trout. — Let the water be thoroughly a-boil before 
you put in the fish. See that it is salt, and that a dash of vin- 



— 37 — 

•egar has been put in it. Remove all scum as it rises, and boil 
the fish till their eyes protrude. Lift them without breaking, 
drain off the liquor, and serve on a napkin, if you like. To be 
eaten with a sauce according to taste, that is, it can be made 
of either anchovies or shrimps. 

Broiled Trout. — Clean and split them open, season with a 
little salt and cayenne ; dip in whipped egg, dredge with flour, 
and branded over a clear fire. Serve with sauce. 

Baked Haddock. — Choose a nice fish of about six pounds, 
which trim and scrape nicely, gutting it carefully, fill the 
vacuum with a stuffing of veal, chopped ham, and bread- 
crumbs, sew up with strong thread, and shape the fish round, 
putting its tail into its mouth, or, if two are required, lay them 
along the dish reversed — that is, tail to head ; rub over with 
plenty of butter, or a batter of eggs and flour, and then 
sprinkle with bread-crumbs. Let the oven be pretty hot when 
put in. In about an hour the fish will be ready. Serve on the 
tin or aisset in which they have been baked, placing them on 
a larger dish for that purpose. Mussel sauce is a good accom- 
paniment. 

Curried Haddock. — Curried haddock is excellent. Fillet the 
fish and curry it in a pint of beef stock slightly diluted with 
water, and thickened with a tablespoonful of curry powder. 
Some cooks chop up an onion to place in the stew. It will 
take an hour to ready this fish. If preferred, fry the fish for 
a few minutes in clean lard or oil before stewing it in the 
curry. 

Rizzared Haddock. — First, of course, procure your fish, 
clean them thoroughly, rub them well with salt, and let them 
lie for one night, after which hang them in the open air, to 
dry, in a shady place. In two days they will be ready for the 
gridiron. Before cooking them take out the backbone and 
skin them, if desired (I never do skin them), broil till ready, 
eat with a little fresh biitter. 

Haddocks can be boiled with advantage : all that is neces- 
sary is to put plenty of salt in the water, and not to serve them 
till they are well done. As a general rule, it may be ascer- 
tained when the fish is sufficiently cooked by the readiness 
with which the flesh lifts from the bone. Stick a fork into 
the shoulder of a cod or haddock and try it. If living suffi- 



— 38 — 

ciently near the sea, procure sea watei' in which to boil your 
haddocks. 

Broiled White-Fish— Fresh.— Wash and drain the fish ; 
sprinkle with pepper and lay with the inside down upon the 
gridiron, and broil over fresh bright coals. When a nice 
brown, turn for a moment on the other side, then take up and 
spread with butter. This is a very nice way of broiling all 
kinds of fish, fresh or salted. A little smoke under the fish 
adds to its flavor. This may be made by putting two or three 
cobs under the gridiron. 

Baked White-Fish. — Fill the fish with a stuffing of fine 
bread-crumbs and a little butter ; sew up the fish ; sprinkle 
with butter, pepper, and salt. Dredge with flour and bake 
one hour, basting often, and serving with parsley sauce or egg 
sauce. 

To Select Lobsters. — These are chosen more by weight than 
size, the heaviest are best ; a good small-sized one will not 
unf requently be found to weigh as heavily as one much larger. 
If fresh, a lobster will be lively and the claws have a strong 
motion when the eyes are pressed with the finger. 

The male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer, and the shell 
a brighter red ; it may readily be distinguished from the 
female ; the tail is narrower, and the two uppermost fins 
within the tail are stiff and hard. Those of the hen lobster 
are not so, and the tail is broader. 

Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on account of 
their coral. The head and small claws are never used. 

Boiled Lobster. — These crustaceans are usually sold ready- 
boiled. When served, crack the claws and cut open the body, 
lay neatly on a napkin-covered dish, and garnish with a few 
sprigs of parsley. Lobster so served is usually eaten cold. 

Curried Lobster. — Pick out the meat of two I'ed lobsters 
from the shells into a shallow sauce-pan, in the bottom of 
which has been placed a thin slice of tasty ham, with a little 
cayenne pepper and a teaspoonful of salt. Mix up half a cup- 
ful of white soup and half a cupful of cream and pour over 
the meat. Put it on the fire and let it simmer for about an 
hour, when you will add a dessert spoonful of curry, and an- 
other of flour rubbed smooth in a little of tlie liquor taken out 
of the pot ; in three minutes the curry will be ready to dish. 



— 39 — 

Some add a dash of lemon to this curry (I don't), and the cream 
can be dispensed with if necessary. Put a rim of well-boiled 
rice round the dish if you like, or serve the rice separately. 

Lobster Chowder. — Four or five pounds of lobster, chopped 
fine; take the green part and add to it four pounded crackers; 
stir this into one quart of boiling milk; then add the lobster, a 
piece of butter one-half the size of an egg, a little pepper and 
salt, and bring it to a boil. 

Chowder.— Cut some slices of pork very thin, and fry them 
out dry in the dinner pot ; then put in a layer of fish cut in 
slices on the pork, then a layer of onions, and then potatoes, all 
cut in exceedingly th'n slices; then fish, onions, potatoes again 
till your materials are all in, putting some salt and pepper on 
each layer of onions ; split some hard biscuits, dip them in 
water, and put them round the sides and over the top ; put in 
water enough to come up in sight ; stew for over half an hour, 
till the potatoes are done ; add half a pint of milk, or a teacup 
of sweet cream, five minutes before you take it up. 

To Fry Smelts. Egg and bread-crumbs, a little flour ; boil- 
ing lard. Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more 
than is necessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth, lightly 
flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle over with very fine bread- 
crumbs, and put them into boiling lard. Fry of a nice pale 
brown, and be careful not to take off the light roughness of 
the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled. Dry them before 
the fire on a drainer, and serve with plain melted butter. 

To Bake Smelts —Smelts, bread-crumbs, one-quarter pound 
of fresh butter, two blades of pounded mace; salt and cayenne 
to taste. Wash and dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, and 
arrange them nicely in a flat baking-dish. Cover them with 
fine bread-crumbs, and place little pieces of butter all over 
them. Season and bake for fifteen minutes. Just before serv- 
ing, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish with fried 
parsley and cut lemon. 

Red Herrings or Yarmouth Bloaters.— The best way to 
cook these is to make incisions in the skin across the fish, be- 
cause they do not then require to be so long on the fire, and 
will be far better than when cut open. The hard roe makes 
a nice relish by pounding it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, 



— 40 — 

and spreading it on toast. If very dry, soak in warm water, 
one hour before dressing. 

Potted Fish. — Take out the backbone of the fish ; for on& 
weighing two pounds take a tablespoon of allspice and cloves 
mixed ; these spices should be put into little bags of not too 
thick muslin ; put sufficient salt directly upon each fish ; then 
roll in a cloth, over which sprinkle a little cayenne pepper ; 
put alternate layers of fish, spice and sago in an earthen jar; 
cover with the best cider-vinegar ; cover the jar closely witli 
a plate and over this put a covering of dough, rolled out to 
twice the thickness of pie crust. Make the edges of paste to 
adhere closely to the sides of the jar, so as to make it air-tight. 
Put the jar into a pot of cold water and let it boil from three 
to five hours, according to quantity. Ready when cold. 

Oysters on the Shell. — Wash the shells and put them on hot 
coals or upon the top of a hot stove, or bake them in a hot 
oven ; open the shells with an oyster knife, taking care to lose 
none of the liquor, and serve quickly on hot plates, with toast. 
Oysters may be steamed in the shells, and are excellent eaten 
in the same manner. 

Oysters Stewed with Milk. — Take a pint of fine oysters, put 
them with their own liquor, and a gill of milk into a stew- 
pan, and if liked, a blade of mace ; set it over the fire, take off 
any scum which may rise ; when they are plump and white 
turn them into a deep plate ; add a bit of butter, and pepper 
to taste. Serve crackers and dressed celery with them. Oys- 
ters may be stewed in their own liquor without milk. 

Oysters Fried in Batter. — Half pint of oysters, two eggs, 
half pint of milk, sufficient flour to make the batter ; pepper 
and salt to taste ; when liked, a little nutmeg ; hot lard. 
Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay 
them on a cloth, to drain thoroughly. Break the eggs into a 
basin, mix the fiour with them, add the milk gradually, Avith 
nutmeg and seasoning, and put the oysters in a batter. Make 
some lard hot in a deep frying-pan, put in the oysters, one at 
a time ; when done, take them up with a sharp-pointed skewer, 
and dish them on a napkin. Fried oysters are frequently 
used for garnishing boiled fish, and then a few bread-crumbs 
should be added to the flour. 



41 — 



Scalloped Oysters.— Two tablespoonfuls of white stock, 
two tablespoonfuls of cream ; pepper and salt to taste ; 
bread-crumbs, oiled butter. Scald the oysters in their own 
liquor, take them out, beard them, and strain the liquor free 
from grit. Put one ounce of butter into a stew-pan ; when 
melted, dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up ; add the stock, 
cream, and strained liquor, and give one boil. Put in the oys- 
ters and seasoning ; let them gradually heat through, but not 
boil. Have ready the scallop-shells buttered ; lay in the oys- 
ters, and as much of the liquid as they will hold ; cover them 
over with bread-crumbs, over which drop a little oiled butter. 
Brown them in the oven, or before the fire, and serve quickly, 
and very hot. 

Fried Oysters.— Take large oysters from their own liquor 
on to a thickly folded napkin to dry them off ; then make a 
tablespoonful of lard or beef fat hot, in a thick bottomed fry- 
ing-pan, add to it half a saltspoonful of salt ; dip each oyster 
in wheat flour, or cracker rolled fine, until it will take up no 
more, then lay them in the pan, hold it over a gentle fire until 
one side is a delicate brown ; turn the other by sliding a fork 
under it ; five minutes will fry them after they are in the pan. 
Oysters may be fried in butter, but it is not so good ; lard and 
butter half and half is very nice for frying. Some persons 
like a very little of the oyster liquor poured in the pan after 
the oysters are done ; let it boil up, then put it in the dish 
with the oysters ; when wanted for breakfast, this should be 
done. 

Oysters to be fried, after drying as directed, may be dipped 
into beaten egg first, then into rolled cracker. 

Oyster Patties.— Make some rich puff paste and bake it in 
very small tin patty pans ; when cool, turn them out upon a 
large dish; stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, 
a little mace and nutmeg ; then add the yolk of one egg, 
boiled hard and grated ; add a little butter, and as much of 
the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they have stewed 
a little while, take them out of the pan and set them to cool. 
When quite cold, lay two or three oysters in each shell of puff 
paste. 

Broiled Oysters.— Drain the oysters well and dry them with 
a napkin. Have ready a griddle hot and well buttered ; 



— 48 — 

season the oysters ; lay them to griddle and brown them on 
both sides Serve them on a hot plate with plenty of butter. 

Clam Fritters. — Take fifty small or twenty-five large sand 
clams from their shells ; if large, cut each in two, lay them on 
a thickly folded napkin ; put a pint bowl of wheat flour into 
a basin, add to it two well-beaten eggs, half a pint of sweet 
milk, and nearly as much of their own liquor ; beat the batter 
until it is smooth and perfectly free from lumps ; then stir in 
the clams. Put plenty of lard or beef fat into a thick-bot- 
tomed frying-pan, let it become boiling hot ; put in the batter 
by the spoonful ; let them fry gently ; when one side is a deli- 
cate brown, turn the other. 

Soft-Shelled Clams. — These are very fine if properly pre- 
pared. They are good only during cold weather and must be 
perfectly fresh. 

Soft-shelled clams may be boiled from the shells, and served 
with butter, pepper, and salt over. 

To Boil Soft-Shell Clams. — Wash the shells clean, and 
put the clams, the edges downwards, in a kettle; then pour 
about a quart of boiling water over them ; cover the pot and 
set it over a brisk fire for three-quarters of an hour ; pouring 
boiling water on them causes the shells to open quickly and 
let out the sand which may be in them. 

Take them up when done ; take off the black skin which 
covers the hard part, trim them clean, and put them into a 
stew-pan ; put to them some of the liquor in which they were 
boiled ; put to it a good bit of butter and pepper and salt to 
taste ; make them hot ; serve with cold butter and rolls. 

Clam Chowder. — Butter a deep tin basin, strew it thickly 
with grated bread-crumbs, or soaked cracker ; sprinkle some 
pepper over and bits of butter the size of a hickory nut, and, 
if liked, some finely chopped parsley ; then put a double layer 
of clams, season with pepper, put bits of butter over, then an- 
other layer of soaked cracker ; after that clams and bits of 
butter ; sprinkle pepper over ; add a cup of milk or water, and 
lasth" a layer of soaked crackers. Turn a plate over the basin, 
and bake in a hot oven for three-quarters of an hour ; use half 
a pound of soda biscuit, and quarter of a pound of butter witli 
fifty clams.

MEATUS. 

Roast Beef. -Prepare for the oven by dredging lightly with 
flour, and seasoning with salt and pepper ; place in the oven, 
and baste frequently while roasting. Allow a quarter of an 
hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare ; longer if you 
like it well done. Serve with a sauce made from the drip- 
pings in the pan, to which has been added a tablespoon of 
Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, and a tablespoon of tomato 
catsup. 

Round of Beef Boiled.-See that it is not too large, and 
that it is tightly bound all round. About twelve pounds or 
fourteen pounds forms a convenient size, and a joint of that 
weio-ht will require from three hours to three hours and a 
quarter to boil. Put on with cold water-as the liquor is va - 
uable for making pea-soup-and let it come slowly to the boil. 
Boil carefully but not rapidly, and skim frequently ; as a rule, 
keep tlie lid of the pot well fixed. The meat may be all the 
better if taken out once or twice in the process of cooking. 
Carrots and turnips may be boiled to serve with the round ; 
they will, of course, cook in about a third of the time neces- 
sary to boil the beef. 

To Boil Corned Beef.— Put the beef in water enough to 
cover it, and let it heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careful 
to take off the grease. Many think it much improved by 
boiling potatoes, turnips, and cabbages with it. In this case 
the veo-etables must be peeled and all the grease carefully 
skimmed as as fast it rises. Allow about twenty minutes of 
boiling for each pound of meat. 

A Nice Way to Serve Cold Beef.— Cut cold roast beef 
in slices, put gravy enough to cover them, and a wineglass of 
catsup or wine, or a lemon sliced thin ; if you have not gravy, 
put hot water and a good bit of butter, with a teaspoonf ul or 
more of browned flour ; put it in a closely covered stew^-pan, 
and let it simmer gently for half an hour. If you choose, 
when the meat is done, cut a leek in thin slices, and chop a 
bunch of parsley small, and add it ; serve boiled or mashed 
potatoes with it. This is equal to beef a-la-mode. 

Or, cold beef may be served cut in neat slices, garnished 
with sprigs of parsley, and made mustard, and tomato catsup 



— 44 — 

in the castor ; serve mashed, if not new potatoes, with it, and 
ripe fruit, or pie, or both, for dessert, for a small family dinner. 
Spiced Beef.— Four pounds of round of beef chopped fine ; 
take from it all fat ; add to it three dozen small crackers' 
rolled fine, four eggs, one cup of milk, one tablespoon ground 
mace, two tablespoons of black pepper, one tablespoon melted 
butter ; mix well and put in any tin pan that it will just fill, 
packing it well ; baste with butter and water, and bake two 
hours in a slow oven. 

Broiled Beefsteak.— Lay a thick tender steak upon a grid- 
iron over hot coals, having greased the bars with butter be- 
fore the steak has been put upon it ; (a steel gridiron with 
slender bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- 
irons commonly used fry and scorch the meat, imparting a 
disagreeable flavor). When done on one side, have ready 
• your platter warmed, with a little butter on it ; lay the steak 
upon the platter with the cooked side down, that the juices 
which have gathered may run on the platter, but do not press 
the meat ; then lay your beefsteak again upon the gridiron 
quickly and cook the other side. When done to your liking, 
put again on the platter, spread lightly with butter, place 
where it will keep warm for a few moments, but not to let the 
butter become oily (over boiling steam is best) ; and then serve 
on hot plates. Beefsteak should never be seasoned with salt 
and pepper while cooking. If your meat is tough, pound tvell 
with a steak mallet on both sides. 

Fried Beefsteaks. — Cut some of the fat from the steak, and 
put it in a frying pan and set it over the fire ; if the steaks are 
not very tender, beat them with a rolling pin, and when the 
fat is boiling hot, put the steak evenly in, cover the pan and 
let it fry briskly until one side is done, sprinkle a little pepper 
and salt over, and turn the other ; let it be rare or well-done 
as may be liked ; take the steak on a hot dish, add a wine- 
glass or less of boiling water or catsup to the gravy ; let it 
boil up once, and pour it in the dish with the steak. 

Beefsteak Pie. — Take some fine tender steaks, beat them a 
little, season with a saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful 
of salt to a two pound steak ; put bits of butter, the size of a 
hickory nut, over the whole surface, dredge a tablespoonful 
of flour over, then roll it up and cut it in pieces two inches 



— 45 — 

long- ; put a rich pie paste around the sides and bottom of a 
tin basin ; put in the pieces of steak, nearly fill the basin with 
water, add a piece of butter the size of a large egg, cut small, 
dredge in a teaspoonful of flour, add a little pepper and salt, 
lay skewers across the basin, roll a top crust to half an inch 
thickness, cut a slit in the centre ; dip your fingers in flour and 
neatly pinch the top and side crust together all around the 
edge. Bake one hour in a quick oven. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Mutton, water, salt. A leg of 
mutton for boiling should not hang too long, as it will not look 
a good color when dressed. Cut off the shank-bone, trim the 
knuckle, and wash and wipe it very clean ; plunge it into 
sufficient boiling water to cover it ; let it boil up, then draw 
the saucepan to the side of the fire, where it should remain 
till the finger can be borne in the water. Then place it suffi- 
ciently near the fire, that the water may gently simmer, and 
be very careful that it does not boil fast, or the meat will be 
hard. Skim well, add a little salt, and in about two and one- 
quarter hours after the water begins to simmer, a moderate- 
sized leg 'of mutton will be done. Serve with carrots and 
mashed turnips, which may be boiled with the meat, and send 
caper sauce to table with it in a tureen. 

Roast Loin of Mutton. — Loin of mutton, a little salt. Cut 
and trim off: the superflous fat, and see that the butcher joints 
the meat properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to the 
carver, Avhen it comes to table. Have ready a nice clear fire 
(it need not be a very wide, large one), put down the meat, 
dredge with flour, and baste well until it is done. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. — Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a 
small piece of butter. Cut the chops from a well-hung, tender 
loin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat, and trim them into 
a nice shape ; slightly beat and level them ; place the gridiron 
over a bright, clear fire, rub the bars with a little fat, and lay 
on the chops. While broiling, frequently turn them, and in 
about eight minutes they will be done. Season with pepper 
and salt, dish them on a very hot dish, rub a small piece of 
butter on each chop, and serve very hot and expeditiously. 

Mutton Chop Fried. — Cut some fine mutton chops without 
much fat, rub over both sides with a mixture of salt and pepper, 
dip them in wheat flour or rolled crackers,'and fry in hot lard or 



— 46 — 

beef drippings, when both sides are a -fine brown, take them 
on a hot dish, put a wine-glass of hot water in tlie pan, let it 
become hot, stir in a teaspoonful of browned flour, let it boil 
up at once, and serve in the pan with the meat. 

Roast Fore-Quarter of Lamb — Lamb, a little salt. To ob- 
tain the flavor of lamb in perfection it should not be long kept; 
time to cool is all that is required ; and though the meat may 
be somewhat thready, the juices and flavor will be infinitely 
superior to that of lamb that has been killed two or three days. 
Make up the fire in good time, that it may be clear and brisk 
when the joint is put down. Place it at sufficient distance to 
prevent the fat from burning, and baste it constantly till the 
moment of serving. Lamb should be very thoroughly done 
without being dried up, and not the slightest appearance of 
red gravy should be visible, as in roast mutton : this rule is 
applicable to all young white meats. Serve with a little gravy 
made in the dripping-pan, the same as for other roasts, and 
send to table with it a tureen of mint sauce. 

Lambs' Sweetbreads. — Two or three sweetbreads, one-half 
pint of veal stock, white pepper and salt to taste, a small bunch 
of green onions, one blade of pounded mace, thickening of 
butter and flour, two eggs, nearly one-half pint of cream, one 
teaspoonful of minced parsley, a very little grated nutmeg. 

Mode : Soak the sweetbreads in lukewarm water, and put 
them into a saucepan with sufficient boiling water to cover 
them, and let them simmer for ten minutes ; then take them 
out and put them into cold water. Now lard them, lay them 
in a stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions, mace, and a 
thickening of butter and flour, and stew gently for one quar- 
ter of an hour or twenty minutes. Beat up the egg with the 
cream, to which add the minced parsley and very little grated 
nutmeg. Put this to the other ingredients ; stir it well till 
quite hot, but do not let it boil after the cream is added, or it 
will curdle. Have ready some asparagus -tops, boiled ; add 
these to the sweetbreads, and serve. 

Lamb Steak dipped in egg, and then in biscuit or bread- 
crumbs, and fried until it is brown, helps to make variety for 
the breakfast table. With baked sweet potatoes, good cof- 
fee, and buttered toast or corn muffins, one may begin the day 
with courage. 



— 47 — 

To Roast Veal. — Rinse the meat in cold water ; if any part 
is bloody, wash it ofif ; make a mixture of pepper and salt, al- 
lowing a large teaspoonf ul of salt, and a saltspoonful of pep- 
per for each pound of meat ; wipe the meat dry ; then rub the 
seasoning into every part, shape it neatly, and fasten it with 
skewers, and put it on a spit, or set it on a trivet or muffin 
rings, in a pan ; stick bits of butter over the whole upper sur- 
face ; dredge a little flour over, put a pint of water in the pan 
to baste with, and roast it before the fire in a Dutch oven or 
reflector, or put it into a hot oven ; baste it occasionally, turn 
it if necessary that every part may be done ; if the water 
wastes add more, that the gravy may not burn ; allow fifteen 
minutes for each pound of meat ; a piece weighing four or five 
pounds will then require one hour, or an hour and a quarter. 

Veal Chops. — Cut veal chops about an inch thick; beat them 
flat with a rolling-pin, put them in a pan, pour boiling water 
over them, and set them over the fire for five minutes ; then 
take them up and wipe them dry ; mix a tablespoonful of salt 
and a teaspoonf ul of pepper for each pound of meat; rub each 
chop over with this, then dip them, first into beaten egg, then 
into rolled crackers as much as they will take up ; then finish 
by frying in hot lard or beef dripping ; or broil them. For the 
broil have some sweet butter on a steak dish ; broil the chops 
until well done, over a bright clear fire of coals (let them do 
gently that they may be well done); then take them on to the 
butter, turn them carefully once or twice in it, and serve. Or 
dip the chops into a batter, made of one egg beaten with half a 
teacup of milk, and as much wheat flour as may be necessary. 
Or simply dip the chops without parboiling into wheat flour : 
make some lard or beef fat hot in a frying-pan ; lay the chops 
in, and when one side is a fine delicate brown, turn the other. 
When all are done, take them up, put a very little hot water 
into the pan, then put it in the dish with the chops. 

Or make a flour gravy thus : After frying them as last di- 
rected, add a tablespoonful more of fat to that in the pan, let 
it become boiling hot ; make a thin batter, of a small table- 
spoonful of wheat flour and cold water ; add a little more salt 
and pepper to the gravy, tlien gradually stir in the batter; stir 
it until it is cooked and a nice brown; then put it over the 
meat, or in the dish with it ; if it is thicker than is liked, add 
a little boiling water. 



— 48 — 

Veal Cutlets. — Two or three pounds of veal cutlets, egg and 
bread-crumbs, two tablespoonf uls of minced savory herbs, salt 
and pepper to taste, a little grated nutmeg. 

Cut the cutlets about three-quarters of an inch in thickness,, 
flatten them, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg ; 
dip them into bread-crumbs and minced herbs, season with 
pepper and salt and grated nutmeg, and fold each cutlet in 
a piece of buttered paper. Broil them, and send them to 
table with melted butter or a good gravy. 

Stuffed Fillet of Veal with Bacon.— Take out the bone from 
the meat, and pin into a round with skewers. Bind securely 
with soft tapes. Fill the cavity left by the bone with a force- 
meat of crumbs, chopped pork, thyme, and parsley, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of lemon-peel. Cover 
the top of the fillet with thin slices of cold cooked, fat bacon or 
salt pork, tying them in place with twines crossing the meat 
in all directions. Put into a pot with two cups of boiling 
water, and cook slowly and steadily two hours. Then take 
from the pot and put into a dripping-pan. Undo the strings 
and tapes. Brush the meat all over with raw egg, sift rolled 
cracker thickly over it, and set in the oven for half an hour, 
basting often with gravy from the pot. When it is well 
browned, lay upon a hot dish with the pork about it. Strain 
and thicken the gravy, and serve in a boat. 

If your fillet be large, cook twice as long in the pot. The 
time given above is for one weighing five pounds. 

Veal Cake (a convenient Dish for a Picnic). — A few slices 
of cold roast veal, a few slices of cold ham, two hard-boiled 
eggs, two tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, a little pepper, 
good gravy, or stock No. 109. 

Cut off all the brown outside from the veal, and cut the eggs 
into slices. Procure a pretty mould ; lay veal, ham, eggs, and 
parsley in layers, with a little pepper between each, and when 
the mould is full, get some strong stock, and fill up the shape. 
Bake for one-half hour, and when cold, turn it out. 

Veal Pie. — Cut abreast of veal small, and put it in a stew- 
pan, with hot water'to cover it ; add to it a tablespoonful of 
salt, and set it over the fire ; take off the scum as it rises ; 
when the meat is tender turn it into a dish to cool ; take out 
all the small bones, butter a tin or earthen basin or pudding- 



— 49 — 

pan, line it with a pie paste, lay some of the parboiled meat in 
to half fill it ; put bits of butter the size of a hickoiy nut all 
over the meat ; shake pepper over, dredge wheat flour over 
until it looks white ; then fill it nearly to the top with some of 
the water in which the meat was boiled ; roll a cover for the 
top crust, puff paste it, giving it two or three turns, and roll it 
to nearly half an inch thickness ; cut a slit in the centre, and 
make several small incisions on either side of it ; lay some 
skewers across the pie, put the crust on, trim the edges neatly 
with a knife ; bake one hour in a quick oven. A breast of veal 
will make two two-quart basin pies ; half a pound of nice 
corned pork, cut in thin slices and parboiled with the meat, 
will make it very nice, and very little, if any butter, will be 
requ-red for the pie ; when pork is used, no other salt will be 
necessary. 

Boiled Calf's Head (without the skin).— Calf s head, water, 
a little salt, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one table- 
spoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste, one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice. 

After the head has been thoroughly cleaned, and the brains 
removed, soak it in warm water to blanch it. Lay the brains 
also into warm water to soak, and let them remain for an hour. 
Put the head into a stew-pan, with sufficient cold water to 
cover it, and when it boils, add a little salt ; take off every 
particle of scum as it rises, and boil the head until perfectly 
tender. Boil the brains, chop them, and mix with them melted 
butter, minced parsley, pepper, salt, and lemon- juice in the 
above proportion. Take up the head, skin the tongue, and 
put it on a small dish with the brains round it. Have ready 
some parsley and butter, smother the head with it. and the re- 
mainder send to table in a tureen. Bacon, ham. pickled pork, 
or a pig's cheek are indispensable with calf's head. The brams 
are sometimes chopped with hard-boiled eggs. 

Calf's Head Cheese. Boil a calf's head in water enough to 
cover it, until the meat leaves the bones, then take it with a 
skimmer into a wooden bowl or tray ; take from it every par- 
ticle of bone ; chop it small ; season with pepper and salt ; a 
heaping tablespoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper will 
be sufficient ; if liked, add a tablespoonful of finely chopped 
sweet herbs ; lay a cloth in a colander, put the minced meat 



— 50 — 

into it, then fold the cloth closely oVer it, lay a plate over, and 
on it a gentle weight. When cold it may be sliced thin for 
supper or sandwiches. Spread each slice with made mustard. 

Boiled Calf s Feet and Parsley and Butter. —Two calf's feet, 
two slices of bacon, two ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls 
of lemon-juice, salt and whole pepper to taste, one onion, a 
bunch of savory herbs, four cloves, one blade of mace, water, 
parsley and butter. 

Procure two white calf's feet ; bone them as far as the first 
joint, and put them into warm water to soak for two hours. 
Then put the bacon, butter, lemon-juice, onions, herbs, spices, 
and seasoning into a stewpan ; lay in the feet and pour in 
just sufficient water to cover the whole. Stew gently for about 
three hours; take out the feet, dish them, and cover with pars- 
ley and butter. 

The liquor they were boiled in should be strained and put 
by in a clean basin for use ; it will be found very good as an 
addition to gravies, etc., etc. 

Calf's Liver and Bacon. — Two or three pounds of liver, 
bacon, pepper and salt to -taste, a small piece of butter, flour, 
two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, one-quarter pint of water. 

Cut the liver in thin slices, and cut as many slices of bacon 
as there are of liver ; fry the bacon first, and put that on a 
hot dish before the fire. Fry the liver in the fat which comes 
from the bacon, after seasoning it with pepper and salt, and 
dredging over it a very little flour. Turn the liver occasionally 
to prevent its burning, and when done, lay it round the dish 
with a piece of bacon between each. Pour away the bacon 
fat, put in a small piece of butter, dredge in a little flour, add 
the lemon-juice and water, give one boil, and pour it in tlie 
middle of the dish. 

Sweetbread. — Three sweetbreads, egg, bread-crumbs, oiled 
butter, three slices of toast and brown gravy. 

Choose large white sweetbreads ; put them into warm water 
to draw out the blood, and to improve their color ; let them 
remain for rather more than one hour ; then put them into 
boiling water, and allow them to simmer for about ten min 
utes, which renders them firm. Take them up, drain them, 
brush over the egg, sprinkle with bread-crumbs ; dip them in 
egg again, and then into more bread-crumbs. Drop on them 



— 51 — 

a little oiled butter, and put the sweetbreads into a moderately 
heated oven, and let them bake for nearly three-quarters of an 
hour. Make three pieces of toast ; place the sweetbreads on 
the toast, and pour round, but not over them, a good brown 
gravy. 

Egged Veal Hash. — Chop fine remnants of cold roast veal. 
Moisten with the gravy or water. When hot, break into it 
three or four eggs, according to the quantity of veal. When 
the eggs are cooked, stir into it a spoonful of butter, and serve 
quickly. If to your taste, shake in a little parsley. Should 
you lack quantity, half a cup of fine stale bread-crumbs are 
no disadvantage. 

Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding. — Have your meat 
ready for roasting on Saturday, always. Roast upon a grating 
of several clean sticks (not pine) laid over the dripping-pan. 
Dash a cup of boiling water over the beef when it goes into 
the oven; baste often, and see that the fat does notscorch. 
About three-quarters of an hour before it is done, mix the 
pudding. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — One pint of milk, four eggs, whites 
and yolks beaten separately ; two cups of flour — prepared 
flour is best ; one teaspoonful of salt. 

Use less flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix quickly ; 
pour off the fat from the top of the gravy in the dripping-pan, 
leaving just enough to prevent the pudding from sticking to 
the bottom. Pour in the batter and continue to roast the beef, 
letting the dripping fall upon the pudding below. The oven 
should be brisk by this time. Baste the meat with the gravy 
you have taken out to make room for the batter. In serving, 
cut the pudding into squares and lay about the meat in the 
dish. It is very delicious. 

Beef Heart, Baked or Roasted. — Cut a beef heart in two, 
take out the strings from the inside ; wash it with warm wa- 
ter, rub the inside with pepper and salt, and fill it with a stuff- 
ing made of bread and butter moistened with water, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt, and, if liked, a sprig of thyme 
made fine ; put it together and tie a string around it, rub the 
outside with pepper and salt ; stick bits of butter on, then 
dredge flour over, and set it on a trivet, or muffin rings, in a 
dripping-pan; put a pint of water in to baste with, then roast 



— 52 — 

it before a hot fire, or in a hot oven ;- turn it around and baste 
frequently. One liour will roast or bake it ; when done, take 
it up, cut a lemon in thin slices, and put it in the pan with a 
bit of butter ; dredge in a teaspoonful of flour ; let it brown; 
add a small teacup of boiling water, stir it smooth, and serve 
in a gravy tureen. 

Beef Kidney. — Cut the kidney into thin slices, flour them, 
and fry of a nice brown. When done, make a gravy in the 
pan by pouring away the fat, putting in a small piece of but- 
ter, one-quarter pint of boiling water, pepper and salt, and a 
tablespoonful of mushroom catsup. Let the gravy just boil 
up, pour over the kidney, and serve. 

Potted Beef — Two pounds of lean beef, one tablespoonful 
of water, one-quarter pound of butter, a seasoning to taste of 
salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and black pepper. Procure a 
nice piece of lean beef .as free as possible from gristle, skin, etc., 
and put it into a jar (if at hand, one with a lid) with one tea- 
spoonful of water. Cover it closely, and put the jar into a sauce 
panof boiling water, letting the water come within two inches 
of the top of the jar. Boil gently for three and a-half hours, then 
take the beef, chop it very small with a chopping-knife, and 
pound it thoroughly in a mortar. Mix with it by degrees all, 
or a portion of the gravy that will have run from it, and a 
little clarified butter ; add the seasoning, put it in small pots 
for use, and cover with a little butter just warmed and poured 
over. If much gravy is added to it, it will keep but a short 
time ; on the contrary, if a large proportion of butter is used, 
it may be preserved for some time. 

Boiled Tongue. — One tongue, a bunch of savory herbs, 
water. In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been 
dried or pickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which de- 
notes its being young and tender. If a dried one, and rather 
hard, soak it at least for twelve hours previous to cooking it ; 
if, however, it is fresh from the pickle, two or three hours 
will be sufficient for it to remain in soak. Put the tongue 
into a stew-pan with plenty of cold water and a bunch of savory 
herbs ; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well, and simmer 
very gently until tender. Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts 
of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue 
is frequently sent to table with boiled poultry, instead of ham, 



— 53 — 

and is, by many persons, preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, 
fasten it down to a piece of board by sticking a fork through 
the root, and another through the top, to straighten it. When 
cold, glaze it, and put a paper ruche round the root, and gar- 
nish with tufts of parsley. 

Fricasseed Tripe. — Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, 
put a small cup of water or milk to it, add a bit of butter the 
size of an egg, dredge in a large teaspoonf ul of flour, or work 
it with the butter ; season with pepper and salt, let it simmer 
gently for half an hour, serve hot. A bunch of parsley cut 
small and put vsrith it is an improvement. 

Broiled Tripe.— Prepare "tripe as for frying ; lay it on a 
gridiron over a clear fire of coals, let it broil gently ; when 
one side is a fine brown, turn the other side (it must be nearly 
done through before turning) ; take it up on a hot dish, butter 
it. and if liked, add a little catsup or vinegar to the gravy. 

Roast Rabbit.— Empty, skin, and thoroughly wash the rab- 
bit ; wipe it dry, line the inside with sausage-meat and force- 
meat (the latter of bread-crumbs, well-seasoned, and worked 
up). Sew the stuffing inside, skewer back the head between 
the shoulders, cut off the fore-joints of the shoulders and legs, 
bring them close to the body, and secure them by means of a 
skewer. Wrap the rabbit in buttered paper, keep it well 
basted, and a few minutes before it is done, remove the paper, 
flour and froth it, and let it acquire a nice brown color. It 
should be done in three-quarters of an hour. Take out the 
skewers, and serve with brown gravy and red-currant jelly. 
To bake the rabbit, proceed in the same manner as above ; in 
a good oven, it will take about the same time as roasting. 
Most cooks garnish the rabbit with slices of lemon, and serve 
up with currant jelly. Sometimes the head is cut off before 
sending to the table ; but this is a matter of individual taste. 

Stewed Rabbit, Larded. — One rabbit, a few strips of bacon, 
rather more than one pint of good broth or stock, a bunch of 
savory herbs, salt and pepper to taste, thickening of butter and 
flour, one glass of sherry. Well wash the rabbit, cut it into 
quarters, lard them with slips of bacon, and fr}^ them ; then 
put them into a stewpan with the broth, herbs, and a season- 
ing of pepper and salt ; simmer gently until the rabbit is ten- 
der, then strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, 



— 54 — 

add the sherry, give one boil, pour it "over the rabbit, and serve. 
Garnish with slices of cut lemon. 

Fricasseed Rabbits. — The best way of cooking rabbits is to 
fricassee them. ' Cut them up, or > disjoint them. Put them 
into a stew-pan ; season them with cayenne pepper, salt and 
some chopped parsley. Pour in a pint of warm water (or of 
veal broth, if you have it) and stew it over a slow fire till the 
rabbits are quite tender ; adding (when they are about half 
done) some bits of butter rolled in flour. Just before you take 
it from the fire, enrich the gravy with a gill or more of thick 
cream with some nutmeg grated into it. Stir the gravy well, 
but take care not to let it boil after the cream is in, lest it 
curdle. Put the pieces of rabbit on a hot dish, and pour the 
gravy over them. 

A Pretty Dish ofi Venison. — Cut a breast of venison in 
steaks, make quarter of a pound of butter hot in a pan, rub 
the steaks over with a mixture of a little salt and pepper, dip 
them in wheat flour, or rolled crackers, and fry a rich brown ; 
when both sides are done, take them up on a dish, and put a 
tin cover over; dredge a heaping teaspoonful of flour into the 
butter in the pan, stir it with a spoon until it is brown, with- 
out burning, put to it a small teacup of boiling water, with a 
tablespoonful of currant jelly dissolved into it, stir it for a few 
minutes, then strain it over the meat and serve. A glass of 
wine, with a tablespoonful of white sugar dissolved in it, may 
be used for the gravy, instead of the jelly and water. Venison 
may be boiled, and served with boiled vegetables, pickled 
beets, etc. , and sauce. 

To Broil Venison Steaks. — Let the gridiron become hot, 
rub the bars with a bit of suet, then lay on the steaks, having 
dipped them in rolled crackers or wheat flour, and set it over 
a bright, clear, but not fierce, fire of coals ; when one side is 
done, take the steak carefully over the steak dish, and hold it 
so that the blood may fall into the dish, then turn them on the 
gridiron, let it broil nicely ; set a steak dish where it will be- 
come hot, put on it a bit of butter the size of an egg for each 
pound of venison, put to it a saltspoon of salt, and the same of 
black pepper, put to it a tablespoonful of currant jelly, made 
liquid with a tablespoonful of hot water or wine, lay the steaks 
on, turn them once or twice in the gravy, and serve hot. Or

• 

they may be simply broiled, and served with butter, pepper 
and salt ; or having broiled one side, and turned the steaks, 
lay thin slices of lemon over, and serve in tlie dish with the 
steaks. 

Beefsteak and Kidney Pudding. — Two pounds of rump- 
steak, two kidneys, seasoning to taste of salt and black pep- 
per, suet crust made with milk {see Pastry), in the proportion 
of six ounces of suet to each one pound of flour. 

Mode : Procure some tender rump-steak (that which has 
been hung a little time), and divide it into pieces about 
an inch square, and cut each kidney into eight pieces. Line 
the dish with crust made with suet and flour in the above 
proportion, leaving a small piece of crust to overlap the 
edge. Then cover the bottom with a portion of the steak and 
a few pieces of kidney; season with salt and pepper (some 
add a little flour to thicken the gravy, but it is not neces- 
sary), and then add another layer of steak, kidney and 
seasoning. Proceed in this manner till the dish is full, 
when pour in sufficient water to come within two inches of 
the top of the basin. Moisten the edges of the crust, cover the 
pudding over, press the two crusts together that the gravy 
may not escape, and turn up the overhanging paste. Wring 
out a cloth in hot water, flour it, and tie up the pudding ; put 
it into boiling water, and let it boil for at least four hours. If 
the water diminishes, always replenish with some, hot in a 
jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and 
not allowed to stop boiling. When the cloth is removed, cut 
a round piece in the top of the crust, to prevent the pudding 
bursting, and send it to table in the basin, either in an orna- 
mental dish, or with a napkin pinned round it. Serve 
quickly.

BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Hashed Cold Meat. — Take your bones, and stew them in a 
a little water with an onion, some salt and pepper, and, if you 
like, a little savory herbs ; when the goodness is all out of the 
bones, and it tastes nice, thicken the gravy with a teaspoonful 
of corn starch, and if it is not very strong put in a bit of but- 
ter, then place your stew-pan on the hot hearth, and put in 
your slices of meat. Wai-m but not boil. Serve with toasted 
bread. 

Corned Beef Hash. — Mince some cold corned beef, a little 
fat with the lean, put to it as much cold boiled potatoes 
chopped as you like (the quantity as of meat or twice as 
much), season with pepper and salt ; add as much gravy or 
hot water as will make it moist, then put in a stew-pan over 
a gentle fire ; dredge in a small quantity of wheat flour ; stir 
it about with a spoon, cover the stew-pan, and let it simmer 
for half an hour — take care that it does not burn. Dish it with 
or without a slice of toast under it, for breakfast. This hash 
may be made without potatoes ; if water is used instead of 
gravy, a bit of butter may be added, more or less, according 
to the proportion of fat with tlie lean meat. 

Dried Beef. — The most common way of serving dried or 
smoked beef is to shave it into thin slices or chips, raw ; but 
a more savory relish may be made of it with little trouble. 
Put the slices of uncooked beef into a frying pan with just 
enough boiling water to cover them ; set them over the fire 
for ten minutes, drain off all the water, and with a knife and 
fork cut the meat into small bits. Return to the pan, which 
should be hot, with a tablespoonful of butter and a little pep- 
per. Have ready some well-beaten eggs, allowing four to a 
half pound of beef ; stir them into the pan with the minced 
meat, and toss and stir the mixture for about two minutes. 
Send to table in a covered dish. 

Chicken Cutlets. — Season pieces of cold chicken or turkey 
with salt and pepper. Dip in melted butter ; let this cool on 
the meat, and dip in beaten egg and in fine bread-crumbs Fry 



— 57 — 

in butter till a delicate brown. Serve on slices of hot toast, 
with either a white or curry sauce poured around. Pieces of 
cold veal make a nice dish, if prepared in this manner. 

Beef Patties.— Chop fine some cold beef ; beat two eggs and 
mix with the meat and add a little milk, melted butter, and 
salt and pepper. Make into rolls and fry. 

Jellied Veal. — Boil the veal tender, pick it up fine, put in a 
mould, add the water it was boiled in, and set it in a cold place; 
season with salt and pepper to taste ; a layer of hard-boiled 
eggs improves it. 

Rice and Meat Croquettes.— One cupful of boiled rice, one 
cupful of finely-chopped cooked meat — any kind ; one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
half a cupful of milk, one egg. Put the milk on to boil, and 
add the meat, rice and seasoning. When this boils, add the 
egg, well beaten ; stir one minute. After cooling, shape, dip 
in egg and crumbs, and fry as before directed. 

American Toast. — To one egg thoroughly beaten, put one 
cup of sweet milk and a little salt. Slice light bread, and dip 
into the mixture, allowing each slice to absord some of the 
milk; then brown on a hot buttered griddle; spread with but- 
ter, and serve hot. 

Meat and Potatoes. — Mince beef or mutton, small, with 
onions, pepper and salt ; add a little gravy, put into scallop 
shells or small cups, making them three parts full, and fill 
them up with potatoes mashed with a little cream, put a bit 
of butter on the top and brown them in an oven. 

Breaded Sausages. — Wipe the sausages dry. Dip them in 
beaten egg and bread-crumbs. Put them in the frying-basket 
and plunge into boiling fat. Cook ten minutes. Serve with a 
garnish of toasted bread and parsle}^ 

Ham Croquettes. — One cupful of finely chopped cooked ham, 
one of bread-crumbs, two of hot mashed potatoes, one large 
tablespoonful of butter, three eggs, a speck of cayenne. Beat 
the ham, cayenne, butter, and two of the eggs into the potato. 
Let the mixture cool slightly, and shape it like croquettes. 
Roll in the bread-crumbs, dip in beaten egg and again in 
crumbs, put in the frying-basket and plunge into boiling fat. 
Cook two minutes. Drain, and serve. 



— 58 — 

A Nice Breakfast Dish. — Chopped, cold meat well seasoned; 
wet with gravy, if convenient, put it on a platter ; then take 
cold rice made moist with milk and one egg, season with pep- 
per and salt ; if not sufficient rice, add powdered bread-crumbs; 
place this around the platter quite thick ; set in oven to heat 
and brown. 

Chicken in Jelly. — A little cold chicken (about one pint), one 
cupful of water or stock, one-fifth of a box of gelatine, half a 
teaspoonful of curry powder, salt, pepper. Cut the meat from 
the bones of a chicken left from dinner. Put the bones on with 
water to cover, and boil down to one cupful. Put the gelatine 
to soak in one-fourth of a cupful of cold water. When the 
stock is reduced as much as is necessary, strain and season. 
Add the curry and chicken. Season, and simmer ten minutes; 
then add the gelatine, and stir on the table until it is dissolved. 
Turn all into a mould, and set away to harden. This makes a 
nice relish for tea or lunch. If you have mushrooms, omit the 
curry, and cut four of them into dice. Stir into the mixture 
while cooking. This dish can be varied by using the whites 
of hard-boiled eggs, or bits of boiled ham. To serve : Dip 
the mould in warm water, and turn out on the dish. Garnish 
with parsley. 

A Good Dish. — Mince cold beef or lamb ; if beef put in a 
pinch of pulverized cloves ; if lamb, a pinch of summer savory 
to season it, very little pepper and some salt, and put it in a 
baking dish ; mash potatoes and mix them with cream and 
butter and a little salt, and spread them over the meat ; beat 
up an egg with cream or milk, a very little ; spread it over the 
potatoes, and bake it a short time, sufficient to warm it 
through and brown the potatoes. 




POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 

Roast Turkey.— Carefully pluck the bird, singe it with white 
paper, and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth ; draw it, preserve 
the liver and gizzard, and be particular not to break the gall- 
bag, as no washing will remove the bitter taste it imparts 
where it once touches. Wash it inside well, and wipe it thor- 
oughly with a dry cloth ; the outside inerely requires wip- 
ing nicely. Cut off the neck close to the back, but leave enough 
of the crop-skin to turn over ; break the leg-bones close below 
the knee ; draw out the strings from the thighs, and flatten the 
breast-bone to make it look plump. Have ready your dress- 
ing of bread-crumbs, mixed with butter, pepper, salt, thyme 
or sweet marjoram ; fill the breast with this, and sew the neck 
over to the back. Be particular that the turkey is firmly 
trussed. Dredge it lightly with flour, and put a piece of butter 
into the basting-ladle ; as the butter melts, baste the bird with 
it. When of a nice brown and well-frothed, serve with a 
tureen of good brown gravy and one of bread-sauce. The liver 
should be put under one pinion, and the gizzard under the 
other. Fried sausages are a favorite addition to roast-turkey; 
they make a pretty garnish, besides adding much to the flavor. 
When these are not at hand, a few force-meat balls should be 
placed round the dish as a garnish. Turkey may also be 
stuffed with sausage-meat, and a chestnut force-meat with 
the same sauce, is by many persons, much esteemed as an ac- 
companiment to this favorite dish. 

Second Recipe. — After drawing and cleansing the turkey, 
prepare a dressing of chopped sausage and bread crumbs, inix- 
ing in butter, pepper, salt and thyme to flavor. Fill the craw 
and the body of the turkey with this, and sew up carefully. 
Dredge with flour and put in the oven to roast, basting freely, 
first with butter and water, then with the gravy from the pan. 
The time it takes to roast will depend both on the age and the 
weight of the turkey. If you have a good fire, you will be safe 
to allow ten minutes or so to the pound. Roast to a fine brown, 
and serve with the chopped giblets, which should be well 
stewed; add cranberry sauce. 



— 60 — 

Boiled Turkey. — Hen turkeys are the best for boiling. They 
are tlie whitest, and, if nicely kept, tenderest. Of course the 
sinews must be drawn, and they ought to be trussed with the 
legs out, so as to be easily carved. Take care to clean the 
turkey well after it has been singed. Place the fowl in a 
sufficiently large pot with clean water sufficient to cover it, 
and a little more ; let the fire be a clear one, but not too fierce, 
as the slower the turkey boils the plumper it will be. Skim 
carefully and constantly, and simmer for two hours and a 
half in the case of a large fowl, and two hours for a smaller 
one, and from an hour and ten to an hour and forty minutes 
for still smaller turkeys. Some people boil their turkeys in a 
floured cloth. I don't ; the whiteness being mostly in the 
fowl itself. My stuffing for a boiled turkey is thought^ good. 
I prepare it of crumbs of stale bread, with a little marrow or 
butter, some finely-shreded parsley, and two dozen small oys- 
ters, minus their beards, of course, and neatly trimmed. Stuff 
with this and a little chopped ham in addition if desired. 

To Roast a Fowl or Chicken. — Have a bright, clear, and 
steady fire for roasting poultry ; prepare it as directed ; spit 
it, put a pint of hot water in the dripping pan, add to it a small 
tablespoonf ul of salt, and a small teaspoonf ul of pepper, baste 
frequently, and let it roast quickly, without scorching ; when 
nearly done, put a piece of butter the size of a large Qgg to 
the water in the pan ; when it melts, baste with it, dredge a 
little flour over, baste again, and let it finish ; half an hour 
will roast a full-grown chicken, if the fire is right. When 
done take it up, let the giblets (heart, liver, and gizzard) boil 
tender, and chop them very fine, and put them in the gravy ; 
add a tablespoonful of browned flour, and a bit of butter, stir 
it over the fire for a few minutes, then serve in a gravy 
tureen. Or put the giblets in the pan and let them roast. 

Boiled Chickens. — Clean, wash, and stuff as for roasting. 
Baste a floured cloth around each, and put into a pot with 
enough boiling water to cover them well. The hot water 
cooks the skin at once, and prevents the escape of the juices. 
The broth will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in cold 
water, but this is a proof that the meat will be more nutritious 
and better flavored. Stew very slowly, for the first half hour 
especially. Boil an hour or more, guiding yourself by size 
and toughness. Serve with egg or bread-sauce. 



— Gl — 

Broiled Chicken. — Prepare in the same way as for boiling, 
cut them in two through the back, and flatten them : place on 
a cold gridiron over a nice red fire. After a little time, when 
they have become thoroughly hot, set them on a plate or other 
dish, and lard them well with a piece of butter ; pepper and 
salt them to taste, chiefly on the inside, then place them on 
the broiler and continue turning till done — they will take 
fully twenty minutes. Serve hot, with a little dab of butter 
and plenty of stewed mushrooms — a delightful dish. 

Fried Chicken. — Cut the chicken in pieces, lay it in salt and 
water, which change several times : roll each piece in flour ; 
fry in very hot lard or butter, season with salt and pepper ; 
fry parsley with them also. Make a gravy of cream seasoned 
with salt, pepper and a little mace, thickened with a little flour 
in the pan in which the chickens were fried, pouring off the 
lard. 

Fricassee of Chicken. — Cut into joints, scald and skin, 
place in a stew-pan, with two raw onions cut into eight parts, 
a little chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and the least squeeze 
of lemon juice. Add a bit of butter as large as an egg, and 
fill in a pint of water. Stew for an hour under a very close 
lid, then lift and strain off the gravy, into which beat grad- 
ually a teacupful of cream and the yolks of two eggs ; heat 
up the gravy, taking care that it does not boil, and pour it 
over the fricassee. 

To Curry Chicken. — Slice an onion and brown in a little 
butter ; add a spoonful of curry powder ; allow it to remain 
covered for a few minutes to cook ; add a little more butter and 
put in chicken, veal, etc., etc.; cut up small, thicken with a 
little flour. This is excellent. 

Pressed Chicken. — Cut up the fowls and place in a kettle 
with a tight cover, so as to retain the steam ; put about two 
teacups of water and plenty of salt and pepper over tlie 
chicken, then let it cook until the meat cleaves easily from 
the bones ; cut or chop all the meat (freed from skin, bone 
and gristle) about as for chicken salad ; season well, put into 
a dish and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was 
cooked over it. This will jelly when cold, and can tlien be 
sliced or set on the table in shape. Nice for tea or lunch. The 
knack of making this simple dish is not having too much 



— G2 — 

water ; it will not jelly if too weak, or if the water is allowed 
to boil away entirely while cooking/ 

Chicken Pot-Pie. — Skin and cut up the fowls into joints, 
and put the neck, legs and backbones in a stew-pan, with a 
little water, an onion, a bunch of savory herbSj and a blade 
of mace ; let these stew for an hour, and, when done, strain 
off the liquor : this is for gravy. Put a layer of fowl at the 
bottom of a pie- dish, then a layer of ham, then one of force- 
meat and hard-boiled eggs, cut in rings ; between the layers 
put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt. 
Pour in about a half a pint of water, border the edge of dish 
with puff-crust, jjut on the cover, ornament the top and glaze 
it by brushing over it the yolk of an egg. Bake for a.bout an 
hour and a half, and, when done, pour in at the'top, the gravy 
made from the bones. 

A Chicken Salad. — Take a fine white bunch of celery (four 
or five heads), scrap and wash it white ; reserve the delicate 
green leaves ; shred the white part like straws, lay this in a 
glass, or white china dish, in the form of a nest. Mince all 
the white meat of a boiled, or white stewed fowl, without the 
skin, and put it in the nest. 

Make a salad dressing thus : Rub the yolks of two hard 
boiled eggs to a smooth paste, with a dessert spoonful of salad 
oil, or melted butter ; add to it two teaspoonf uls of made mus- 
tard, and a small teaspoonf ul of fine white sugar, and put to 
it gradually (stirring it in) a large cup of strong vinegar. 

Make a wreath of the most delicate leaves of the celery, 
around the edge of the nest, between it and the chicken ; pour 
the dressing over the chicken when ready to serve; if the dress- 
ing is poured over too soon it will discolor the celery. 

White heart lettuce may be used for the nest, instead of 
celery. 

Jellied Chicken. — Boil a fowl until it will slip easily from 
the bones ; let the water be reduced to about one pint in boil- 
ing ; pick the meat from the bones in good sized pieces, taking 
out all gristle, fat and bones , place in a wet mould ; skim the 
fat from the liquor ; a little butter ; pepper and salt to the 
taste, and one half ounce of gelatine. When this dissolves, 
pour it hot over the chicken. The liquor must be seasoned 
pretty high, for the chicken absorbs. 



— 63 — 

Chicken Pates. — Mince chicken that has been previously 
roasted or boiled, and season Avell ; stir into this a sauce made 
of half a pint of milk, into which while boiling a teaspoonful 
of corn starch has been added to thicken, season with butter, 
about a teaspoonful, and salt and pepper to taste. Have ready 
small pate pans lined with a good puff paste. Bake the crust 
in a brisk oven ; then fill the pans and set in the oven a few 
minutes to brown very slightly. 

Sage-and-Onion Stuffing, for Geese, Ducks and Pork. — 

Four large onions, ten sage-leaves, one quarter pound of 
bread-crumbs, one and one half ounce of butter, salt and pep- 
per to taste, one egg. Peel the onions, put them into boiling 
water, let them simmer for five minutes or rather longer, and 
just before they are taken out, put in the sage-leaves for a 
minute or two to take off their raAvness. Chop both these very 
fine, add the bread, seasoning and butter, and work the whole 
together with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be 
ready for use. It should be rather highly seasoned, and the 
sage-leaves should be very finely chopped. Many cooks do 
not parboil the onions in the manner just stated, but merely 
use them raw. The stuffing then, however, is not nearly so 
mild, and to many tastes, its strong flavor would be very ob- 
jectionable. When made for goose, a portion of the liver of 
the bird, simmered for a few minutes and very finely minced, 
is frequently added to this stuffing ; and where economy is 
studied, the egg may be dispensed with. 

To Roast a Goose. — Having drawn and singed the goose, 
wipe out the inside with a cloth, and sprinkle in some pepper 
and salt. Make a stuffing of four good sized onions, minced 
fine, and half their quantity of green sage leaves, minced also, 
a large teacupful of grated bread-crumbs, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, and the beaten yolks of two eggs, with a lit- 
tle pepper and salt. Mix the whole together, and incorporate 
them well. Put the stuffing into the goose, and press it in 
hard ; but do not entirely fill up the cavity, as the mixture 
will swell in cooking. Tie the goose securely round with a 
greased or wetted string ; and paper the breast to prevent it 
from scorching. The fire must be brisk and well kept up. It 
w^ll require from two hours to two and a half to roast. Baste 
it at first with a little salt and water, and then with its own 



— 04 — 

gravy. Take off the paper when the goose is about half done, 
and dredge it with a little flour towards the last. Having par- 
boiled the liver and heart, chop them and put them into the 
gravy, which must be skimmed well and thickened with a lit- 
tle browned flour. 

Send apple sauce to table with the goose ; also mashed po- 
tatoes. 

A goose may be stuffed entirely with potatoes, boiled and 
mashed with milk, butter, pepper and salt. 

You may make a gravy of the giblets, that is the neck, pin- 
ions, liver, heart and gizzard, stewed in a little water, thick- 
ened with butter, rolled in flour, and seasoned with pepper 
and salt. Before you send it to table, take out all but the liver 
and heart ; mince them and leave them in the gravy. This 
gravy is by many preferred to that which comes from the goose 
in roasting. It is well to have both. 

If a goose is old it is useless to cook it, as when hard and 
tough it cannot be eaten. 

Roast Ducks. — Wash and dry the ducks carefully. Make 
a stuffing of sage and onion ; insert, and sew up completely 
that the seasoning may not escape. If tender, ducks do not 
require more than an hour to roast. Keep them well basted, 
and a few minutes before serving, dredge lightly with flour, to 
make them froth and look plump. Send to table hot, with a 
good brown gravy poured not round but over them. Accom- 
pany with currant jelly, and, if in season, green peas. 

Roast Pigeons. — Clean the pigeons, and stuff them the same 
as chickens : leave the feet on, dip them into scalding water, 
strip off the skin, cross them, and tie them together below the 
breast bone ; or cut them off ; the head may remain on ; if so, 
dip it in scalding water, and pick it clean ; twist the wings 
back, put the liver between the right wing and the body, and 
turn the head under the other ; rub the outside of each bird 
with a mixture of pepper and salt ; spit them, and put some 
water in the dripping-pan ; for each bird put a bit of butter the 
size of a small egg, put them before a hot fire, and let them 
roast quickly ; baste frequently, half an hour will do them ; 
when nearly done, dredge them with wheat flour and baste 
with the butter in the pan ; turn them, that they may be nicely 
and easilv browned : when done, take them up, set the pan 



— 65 — 

over the fire, make a thin batter of a teaspoonf ill of wheat 
flour, and cold water, when the gravy is boiling hot, stir it in; 
continue to stir it for a few minutes, 'until it is brown, then 
pour it through a gravy sieve into a tureen, and serve with 
the pigeons. 

To Make a Bird's Nest. — Boil some yellow macaroni gently, 
until it is quite swelled out and tender, then cut it in pieces, 
the length of a finger, and lay them on a dish like a straw 
nest. 

Truss pigeons with the heads on (having scalded and 
picked them clean), turned under the left wing, leave the feet 
on, and having stewed them, arrange them as in a nest ; pour 
the gravy over and serve. 

The nest may be made of boiled rice, or bread cut in pieces, 
the length and thickness of a finger, and fried a nice brown in 
hot lard, seasoned with pepper and salt. Or, make it of bread, 
toasted a yellow brown. Any small birds may be stewed or 
roasted, and served in this way. 

Pigeons in Jelly.-:— Wash and truss one dozen pigeons Put 
them in a kettle with four pounds of the shank of veal, six 
cloves, twenty-five peppercorns, an onion that has been fried 
in one spoonful of butter, one stalk of celery, a bouquet of 
sweet herbs and four and a half quarts of water. Have the 
veal shank broken in small pieces. As soon as the contents 
of the kettle come to a boil, skim carefully, and set for three 
hours where they will just simmer. After they have been 
cooking one hour, add two tablespoonfuls of salt. When the 
pigeons are done, take them up, being careful not to break 
them, and remove the strings. Draw the kettle forward, where 
it will boil rapidly, and keep there for forty minutes ; then 
.strain the liquor through a napkin, and taste to see if sea- 
soned enough. The water should have boiled down to two 
and a half quarts. Have two moulds that will each hold six 
pigeons. Put a thin layer of the jelly in these, and set on ice to 
harden. When hard, arrange the pigeons in them, and cover 
with the jelly, which must be cold, but liquid. Place in the 
ice chest for six or, better still, twelve hours. There should 
be only one layer of the pigeons in the mould. 

To serve : Dip the mould in a basin of warm water for one 
minute, and turn on a cold dish. Garnish with pickled beets 
and parsley. A Tartare sauce can be served with this dish. 



— G6 — 

If squabs are used, two hours will cook them. All small 
birds, as well as partridge, grouse, etc., can be prepared in 
the same manner. Remember that the birds must be cooked 
tender, and that the liquor must be so reduced that it will be- 
come jellied. 

Pigeon Pie. — Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub the 
outside and in with a mixture of pepper and salt ; rub the in- 
side with a bit of butter, and fill it with a bread-and-butter 
stuffing, or mashed potatoes ; sew up the slit, butter the sides 
of a tin basin or pudding-dish, and line (the sides only) with 
pie paste rolled to quarter of an inch thickness ; lay the birds 
in ; for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of 
sweet butter and put it over them, strew over a large tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a small teaspoonful of pepper, with a 
bunch of finely cut parsley, if liked ; dredge a large table- 
spoonful of wheat flour over ; put in water to nearly fill the 
pie ; lay skewers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust ; 
cut a slit in the middle, ornament the edge with leaves, braids, 
or shells of paste, and put it in a moderately hot or quick oven, 
for one hour ; when nearly done, brush the top over with 
the yolk of an egg beaten with a little milk, and finish. 
The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or more pieces, if 
preferred. 

Any small birds may be done in this manner. 

Wild Ducks. — Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a 
fishy flavor, and when handled by inexperienced cooks, are 
sometimes uneatable from this cause. Before roasting them, 
guard against this by parboiling them with a small carrot, 
peeled, put within each. Tliis will absorb the unpleasant 
taste. An onion will have the same effect ; but, unless you 
mean to use onion in the stuffing, the carrot is preferable. In 
my own kitchen, I usually put in the onion, considering a 
suspicion of garlic a desideratum in roast duck, whether wild 
or tame. 

Roast Wild Duck.— Parboil as above directed; throw away 
the carrot or onion, lay in fresh water half an hour ; stuff 
with bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, sage, and onion, 
and roast until brown and tender, basting for half the time 
v/ith butter and water, then with the drippings. Add to the 
gravy, when you have taken up the ducks, a teaspoonful of 



— 67 — 

currant jelly, and a pinch of cayenne. Thicken with 
browned flour and serve in a tureen. 

Wild Turkey.— Draw and w^ash the inside very carefully, 
-as with all game. Domestic fowls are, or should be, kept up 
without eating for at least twelve hours before they are killed; 
but we must shoot wild when we can get the chance, and of 
course it often happens that their crops are distended by a re- 
cent hearty meal of rank or green food. Wipe the cavity with 
a dry soft cloth before you stuff. Have a rich force-meat, 
bread-crumbs, some bits of fat pork, chopped fine, pepper and 
salt. Moisten with milk, and beat in an egg and a couple of 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Baste with butter and water 
for the first hour, then three or four times with gravy ; lastly, 
five or six times with melted butter. A generous and able 
housekeeper told me once that she always allowed a pound of 
butter for basting a large wild turkey. This was an extrava- 
gant quantity, but the meat is drier than that of the domestic 
fowl, and not nearly so fat. Dredge with fiour at the last, 
froth with butter, and when he is of a tempting brown, serve. 
Skim the gravy, add a little hot water, pepper, thicken with 
the giblets chopped fine and browned flour, boil up, and pour 
into a tureen. At the South the giblets are not put in the 
gravy, but laid whole, one under each wing, when the turkey 
•s dished. Garnish with small fried sausages, not larger than 
a dollar, crisped parsley between them. Send around currant 
jelly and cranberry sauce with it. 

To Roast Snipes, Woodcocks, or Plovers. — Pick them im- 
mediately ; wipe them, and season them slightly with pepper 
ond salt. Cut as many slices of bread as you have birds. 
Toast them brown, butter them, and lay them in the pan. 
Dredge the birds with flour, and put them in the oven with a 
brisk fire. Baste them with lard, or fresh butter. They will 
be done in twenty or thirty minutes. Serve them up laid on 
the toast, and garnished with sliced orange, or with orange 

jelly. 

Roast Partridge. — Choose young birds, with dark-colored 
bills and yellowish legs, and let them hang a few days, or 
there will be no fiavor to the flesh, nor will they be tender. The 
time they should be kept, entirely depends on the taste of 
those for whom they are intended, as what some persons 



— (jS — 

would consider delicious, would be to others disgusting and 
offensive. They may be trussed - with or without the head, 
the latter mode being now considered the most fashionable. 
Pluck, draw, and wipe the partridge carefully inside and out ; 
cut off the head, leaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer 
back ; bring the legs close to the breast, between it and the 
side-bones, and pass a skewer through the pinions and thick 
part of the thighs. When the head is left on, it should be 
brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer. When 
the bird is firmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a nice 
briglit fire ; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before 
serving, fiour and froth it well. Dish it, and serve with gravy 
and bread-sauce, and send to table hot and quickly. A little 
of the gravy should be poured over the bird. 

Roast Quail. — Pluck and draw the birds, rub a little butter 
over them, tie a strip of bacon over the breasts, and set them 
in the oven for twenty to twenty-five minutes. 

Roast Prairie Chicken. — The bird being a little strong, and 
its flesh when cooked a little dry, it should be either larded or 
wide strips of bacon or pork placed over its breast. A mild 
seasoned stuffing will improve the flavor of old birds. Dust 
a little flour over them, baste occasionally, and serve. Pheas- 
ants may be managed in the same manner. * 

Larded Grouse. — Clean and wash the grouse. Lard the 
breast and legs. Run a small skewer into the legs and through 
the tail. Tie firmly with twine. Dredge with salt, and rub 
the breast with soft butter ; then dredge tliickly with flour. 
Put into a quick oven. If to be very rare, cook twenty min- 
utes ; if wished better done, thirty minutes. The former time, 
as a general thing, suits gentlemen better, but thirty minutes 
is preferred by ladies. If the birds are cooked in a tin-kitchen, 
it should be for thirty or thirty-five minutes. When done, 
place on a hot dish, on which has been spread bread sauce. 
Sprinkle fried crumbs over both grouse and sauce. Garnish 
with parsley. The grouse may, instead, be served on a hot 
dish, with the parsley garnish, and the sauce and crumbs 
served in separate dishes. The first method is the better, 
however, as you get in the sauce all the gr.avy that comes 
from the birds.

Pork, Hams, etc.— To Choose Pork.— If the rind of pork is 
tough and thick, and cannot easily be impressed with the fin- 
ger, it is old. 

If fresh, the flesh will look cool and smooth ; when moist or 
clammy it is stale. The knuckle is the first to become tainted. 

Pork is often what is called measly, and is then almost 
poisonous ; measly pork may easily be detected, the fat being 
full of small kernels. Swill or still-fed pork is not fit for 
curing ; either dairy or corn fed is good. 

Fresh pork is in season from October to April. 

In cutting up a large hog, it is first cut in two down the back 
and belly. The chine or backbone should be cut out from 
each side the whole length, and is either boiled or roasted. 
The chine is considered the prime part. The sides of the hog 
are made into bacon, and the inside or ribs is cut with very 
little meat ; this is the spare-rib. 

To Roast a Leg of Pork. — Take a sharp knife and score 
the skin across in narrow stripes (you may cross it again so 
as to form diamonds) and rub in some powdered sage. Raise 
the skin at the knuckle and put in a stuffing of minced onion 
and sage, bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg. 
Fasten it down with a buttered string, or with skewers. You 
may make deep incisions in the meat of the large end of the 
leg, and stuff them also, pressing in the filling very hard. Rub 
a little sweet oil all over the skin with a brush or a goose 
feather, to make it crisp and of a handsome brown. A leg of 
pork will require from three to four hours to roast. Moisten 
it all the time by brushing it with sweet oil, or with fresh but- 
ter tied in a rag. To baste it with its own dripping will make 
the skin tough and hard. Skim the fat carefully from the 
gravy, which should be thickened with a little fiour. 

A roast leg of pork should always be accompanied by apple 
sauce, and by mashed potatoes and mashed turnips. 

Pork and Beans. — Pick over carefully a quart of beans 
and let them soak over night ; in the morning wash and drain 
m another water, put on to boil in cold water with half a tea- 
spoon of soda ; boil about thirty minutes (when done the skin 
of a bean will crack if taken out and blown upon), drain, and 
put in an earthen pot first a slice of pork and then the beans, 
with two or three tablespoons of molasses When the beans 



— 70 — 

are in the pot, put in the centre half or three-fourths of a 
pound of well-v/ashed salt pork with the rind scored in slices 
or squares, and uppermost ; season- with pepper and salt if 
needed ; cover all with hot water, and bake six hours or longer 
in a moderate oven, adding hot water as needed ; they cannot 
be baked too long. Keep covered so that they will not burn 
on the top, but remove cover an hour or two before serving, 
to brown the top and crisp the pork. 

Pork Sausages. — Take such a proportion of fat and lean 
pork as you like ; chop it quite fine, and for every ten pounds 
of meat take four ounces of fine salt, and one of fine pepper ; 
dried sage, or lemon thyme, finely powdered, may be added if 
liked ; a teaspoonful of sage, and the same of ground allspice 
and cloves, to each ten pounds of meat. Mix the seasoning 
through the meat ; pack it down in stone pots, or put it in 
muslin bags. Or fill the hog's or ox's guts, having first made 
them perfectly clean, thus : empty them, cut them in lengths, 
and lay them three or four days in salt and water, or weak 
lime water ; turn them inside out once or twice, scrape them ; 
then rinse them, and fill with the meat. 

If you do not use the skins or guts, make the sausage meat 
up the size and shape of sausages, dip them in beaten egg, and 
then into wheat flour, or rolled crackers, or simply into wheat 
flour, and fry in hot lard. Turn them, that every side may be 
a flne color. Serve hot, with boiled potatoes or hominy ; either 
taken from the gravy, or after they are fried, pour a little boil- 
ing water into the gravy in the pan, and pour it over them ; 
or first dredge in a teaspoonful of wheat fiour, stir it until it 
is smooth and brown ;then add a little boiling water, let it boil 
up once, then put it in the dish with the sausages. 

Chopped onion and green parsley may be added to the 
sausage meat, when making ready to fry. 

Or sausage meat may be tied in a muslin bag. and boiled, 
and served with vegetables ; or let it become cold, and cut i-n. 
slices. 

Pork Chops, Steaks and Cutlets.— Fry or stew pork chops, 
after taking off the rind or skin, the same as for veal. 

Cutlets and steaks are also fried, broiled, or stewed, the 
same as veal. 

Roast Pig.— Thoroughly clean the pig, then rinse it in cold 
water, wipe it dry ; then rub the inside with a mixture of salt 



— 71 — 

and pepper, and if liked, a little pounded and sifted sage : 
make a stuffing thus : cut some wheat bread in slices half an 
inch thick, spread butter on to half its thickness, sprinkled 
with pepper and salt, and if liked, a little pounded sage and 
minced onion ; pour enough hot water over the bread to make 
it moist or soft, then fill the body with it and sew it together, 
or 'tie a cord around it to keep the dressing in, then spit it ; 
put a pint of water in the dripping-pan, put into it a table- 
spoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper, let the fire be 
hotter at each end than in the middle, put the pig down at a 
little distance from the fire, baste it as it begins to roast, and 
gradually draw it nearer ; continue to baste occasionally ; 
turn it that it may be evenly cooked ; when the eyes drop out 
it is done ; or a better rule is to judge by the weight, fifteen 
minutes for each pound of meat, if the fire is right. 

Have a bright clear fire, with a bed of coals at the bottom ; 
first put the roast at a little distance; and gradually draw it 
nearer ; when the pig is done stir up the fire, take a coarse 
cloth with a good bit of butter in it, and wet the pig all over 
with it, and when the crackling is crisp take it up ; dredge a 
little flour into the gravy, let it boil up once, and having boiled 
the heart, liver, etc., tender, and chopped it fine, add it to the 
gravy, give it one boil, then serve. 

Pig's Cheek. — Is smoked and boiled like ham with vegeta- 
bles ; boiled cabbage or fried parsnips may be served with it. 

Roast Spare-Rib. — Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack 
the ribs across the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with 
pepper, fold over, stuff with turkey-dressing, sew up tightly, 
place in dripping-pan with a pint of water, baste frequently, 
turning over once so as to bake both sides equally until a rich 
brown. 

Pork Fritters. — Have at hand a thick batter of Indian meal 
and flour ; cut a few slices of pork and fry them in the frying- 
pan until the fat is fried out; cut a few more slices of the pork, 
dip them in the batter, and drop them in the bubbling fat, sea- 
soning with salt and pepper ; cook until light brown, and eat 
while hot. 

Baked Ham. — Cover your ham with cold water, and simmer 
gently just long enough to loosen the skin, so that it can be 
pulled off. This will probably be from two or three hours. 



according to the size of your ham. When skinned, put in a 
dripping-pan in the oven, pour over it a teacup of vinegar 
and one of hot water, in which dissolve a teaspoonful of 
English mustard, bake slowly, basting with the liquid, for 
two hours. Then cover the ham all over to the depth of one 
inch with coarse brown sugar, press it down firmly, and do 
not baste again until the sugar has formed a thick crust, 
which it will soon do in a very slow oven. Let it remain a full 
hour in, after covering with the sugar, until it becomes a rich 
golden brown. When done, drain from the liquor in the pan 
and put on a dish to cool. When it is cool, but not cold, press 
by turning another flat dish on top, with a weight over it. 
You will never want to eat ham cooked in any other way 
when you have tasted this, and the pressing makes it cut 
firmly for sandwiches or slicing. 

To Boil a Ham. — Wash thoroughly with a cloth. Select a 
small size to boil, put it in a large quantity of cold water, and 
boil twenty minutes for each pound, allowing it to boil slowly : 
take off the rind while hot and put in the oven to brown 
half an hour ; remove and trim. 

To Broil Ham. — Cut some slices of ham, quarter of an inch 
thick, lay them in hot water for half an hour, or give them a 
scalding in a pan over the fire ; then take them up, and lay 
them on a gridiron, over bright coals ; when the outside is 
browned, turn the other ; then take the slices on a hot dish, 
butter them freely, sprinkle pepper over and serve. Or, after 
scalding them, wipe them dry, dip each slice in beaten egg, 
and then into rolled crackers and fry or broil. 

Fried Ham and Eggs (a Breakfast Dish). — Cut the ham into 
slices, and take care that they are of the same thickness in 
every part. Cut off the rind, and if the ham should be partic- 
ularly hard and salt, it will be found an improvement to soak 
it for about ten minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a cloth. 
Put it into a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the 
slices three or four times whilst they are cooking. W^hen done, 
place them on a dish, which should be kept hot in front of the 
fire during the time the eggs are being poached. Poach the 
eggs, slip them on to the slices of ham, and serve quickly. 

Ham Toast.— Mince finely a quarter of a pound of cooked 
ham with an anchovy boned and washed ; add a little cay- 



— 73 — 

enne and pounded mace ; beat up two eggs ; mix with the 
mince, and add just sufficient milk to keep it moist ; make 
it quite hot, and serve on small rounds of toast or fried 
bread. 

Head Cheese. — Having thoroughly cleaned a hog's head or 
pig's head, split it in two with a sharp knife, take out the eyes, 
take out the brains, cut off the ears, and pour scalding water 
over them and the head, and scrape them clean. Cut off any 
part of the nose which may be discolored so as not to be 
scraped clean ; then rinse all in cold water, and put it into a 
large kettle with hot (not boiling) water to cover it, and set 
the kettle (having covered it) over the fire ; let it boil gently, 
taking off the scum as it rises ; when boiled so that the bones 
leave the meat readily, take it from the water with a skimmer 
into a large wooden bowl or tray ; take from it every particle 
of bone ; chop the meat small and season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and if liked, a little chopped sage or thyme ; spread a 
cloth in a colander or sieve ; set it in a deep dish, and put the 
meat in, then fold the cloth closely over it, lay a weight on 
which may press equally the whole surface (a sufficiently large 
plate will serve). Let the weight be more or less heavy, ac- 
cording as you may wish the cheese to be fat or lean ; a heavy 
weight, by pressing out the fat, will of course, leave the cheese 
lean. When cold, take the weight off ; take it from the colan- 
der or sieve, scrape off whatever fat may be found on the out- 
side of the cloth, and keep the cheese in the cloth in a cool 
place; to be eaten sliced thin, with or without mustard, and 
vinegar, or catsup. After the water is cold in which the head 
was boiled, take off the fat from it, and whatever may have 
drained from the sieve, or colander and cloth ; put it together 
in some clean water, give it one boil ; then strain it through a 
cloth, and set it to become cold ; then take off the cake of fat. 
It is fit for any use. 

Pigs' Feet Soused. — Scald and scrape clean the feet ; if the 
covering of the toes will not come off without, singe them in 
hot embers, until they are loose, then take them off. Many 
persons lay them in weak lime water to whiten them. Having 
scraped them clean and white, wash them and put them in a 
pot of hot (not boiling) water, with a little salt, and let them 
boil gently, until by turning a fork in the flesh it will easily 



— 74 — 

break, and the bones are loosened. Take off the scum as it 
rises. When done, take them from the hot water into cold 
vinegar, enough to cover them, add to it one-third as much of 
the water in which they were boiled ; add whole pepper and 
allspice, with cloves and mace if liked, put a cloth and a tight 
fitting cover over the pot or jar. Soused feet may be eaten 
cold from the vinegar, split in two from top to toe, or having 
split them, dip them in wheat flour and fry in hot lard, or 
broil and butter them. In either case, let them be nicely 
browned. 

To Tell Good Eggs. — Put them in water — if the large end 
turns up, they are not fresh. This is an infallible rule to dis- 
tinguish a good egg from a bad one. 

Keeping Eggs Fresh. — " All it is necessary to do to keep 
eggs through summer is to procure small, clean, wooden or tin 
vessels, holding from ten to twenty gallons, and a barrel, more 
or less, of common, fine-ground land plaster. Begin by put- 
ting on the bottom of the vessel two or three inches of plaster, 
and then, having fresh eggs, with the yolks unbroken, set them 
up, small end down, close to each other, but not crowding, 
and make the first layer. Then add more plaster and enough 
so the eggs will stand upright, and set up the second layer ; 
then another deposit of plaster, followed by a layer of eggs, 
till the vessel is full, and finish by covering the top layer with 
plaster. Eggs so packed and subjected to a temperature of at 
least 85 degrees, if not 90 degrees, during August and Septem- 
ber, came out fresh, and if one could be certain of not having 
a temperature of more than 75 degrees to contend with, I am 
confident eggs could be kept by these means all the year round. 
Observe that the eggs must be fresh laid, the yolks unbroken, 
the packing done in small vessels, and with clean, fine-ground 
land plaster, and care must be taken that no egg so presses on 
another as to break the shell." 

Eggs may be kept good for a year in the following manner : 
To a pail of water, put of unslacked lime and coarse salt 
each a pint ; keep it in a cellar, or cool place, and put the eggs 
in, as fresh laid as possible. 

It is well to keep a stone pot of this lime water ready to re- 
ceive the eggs as soon as laid ; make a fresh supply everj^ few 
months. This lime water is of exactly the proper strength ; 



— To — 

strong lime water will cook the eggs. Very strong lime water 
will eat the shell. 

Poached Eggs. — Two eggs, tw^o tablespoonfuls of milk, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of butter. Beat the 
eggs, and add the salt and milk. Put the butter in a small 
saucepan, and when it melts, add the eggs. Stir over the fire 
until the mixture thickens, being careful not to let it cook 
hard. About two minutes will cook it. The eggs, when done, 
should be soft and creamy. Serve immediately. 

Dropped Eggs. — Have one quart of boiling water and one 
tablespoonful of salt in a frying-pan. Break the eggs, one by 
one, into a saucer, and slide carefully into the salted water. 
Cook until the whites are firm, and lift out with a griddle-cake 
turner and place on toasted bread. Serve immediately. 

Stuffed Eggs. — Six hard-boiled eggs cut in two, take out 
the yolks and mash fine ; then add two teaspoonfuls of butter, 
one of cream, two or three drops of onion juice, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Mix all thoroughly and fill the eggs with this 
mixture ; put them together. Then there will be a little of the 
filling left, to which add one well beaten egg. Cover the eggs 
with *this mixture, and then roll in cracker crumbs. Fry a light 
brown in boiling fat. Plain baked eggs make a quite pretty 
breakfast dish. Take a round white-ware dish thick enough to 
stand the heat of the oven, put into it sufficient fresh butter, 
and break as many eggs in it as are desirable, putting a few 
bits of butter on the top, and set in a rather slow oven until 
they are cooked. Have a dish of nicely made buttered toast 
arranged symmetrically on a plate, and garnish it and the dish 
of eggs with small pieces of curled parsley. 

Eggs a la Suisse. — Spread the bottom of a dish with two 
ounces of fresh butter ; cover this with grated cheese ; break 
eight whole eggs upon the cheese without breaking the yolks. 
Season Avith red pepper and salt if necessary ; pour a little 
cream on the surface, strew about two ounces of grated cheese 
on the top, and set the eggs in a moderate oven for about a 
quarter of an hour. Pass a hot salamander over the top, to 
brown it. 

Eggs Brouille. — Six eggs, half a cupful of milk, or, better 
still, of cream ; two mushrooms, one teaspoonful of salt, a 
little pepper, three tablespoonfuls of butter, a slight grating 



— 76 — 

of nutmeg. Cut the mushrooms into dice, and fry them for 
one minute in one tablespoonf ul of the butter. Beat the eggs, 
salt, pepper and cream together, and put them in a saucepan; 
add the butter and mushrooms to these ingredients. Stir 
over a moderate heat until the mixture begins to thicken; 
take from the fire, and beat rapidly until the eggs become 
quite thick and creamy. Have slices of toast on a hot dish ; 
heap the mixture on these, and garnish with points of toast. 
Serve immediately. 

Curried Eggs. — Slice two onions and fry in butter ; add a 
tablespoonful curry powder and one pint good broth, or stock ; 
stew till onions are quite tender. Add a cup of cream, thick- 
ened with arrowroot, or rice flour ; simmer a few moments, 
then add eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, and beat 
them well, but do not boil. 

Creamed Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make one 
pint of cream sauce. Have six slices of toast on a hot dish, 
put a layer of sauce on each one, and then part of the whites 
of the eggs cut in thin strips, and rub part of the yolks through 
a sieve on to the toast. Repeat this, and finish with a third 
layer of sauce. Place in the oven for about three minutes. 
Garnish with parsley, and serve. 

Soft-boiled Eggs. — Place the eggs in a warm saucepan, and 
cover with boiling water. Let them stand where they will 
keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes. This method will cook 
both whites and yolks. 

Eggs upon Toast. — Put a good lump of butter into the fry- 
ing-pan. When it is hot, stir in four or five well-beaten eggs, 
with pepper, salt, and a little parsley. Stir and toss for three 
minutes. Have ready to your hand some slices of buttered 
toast (cut round with a tin cake cutter before they are toasted); 
spread thickly with ground or minced tongue, chicken or ham; 
heap the stirred Qgg upon these in mounds, and set in a hot 
dish, garnished with parsley and pickled beets. 

Dutch Omelet. — Break eight eggs into a basin, season with 
pepper and salt, add two ounces of butter cut small ; beat these 
well together ; make an ounce of butter hot in a frying-pan, 
put the eggs in, continue to stir it, drawing it away from the 
sides, that it may be evenly done ; shake it now and then, to 
free it from the pan ; when the under side is a little browned. 



turn the omelet into a dish, and serve. This must be done over 
a moderate fire. 

Eggs Poached in Balls.— Put three pints of boiling water 
into a stew-pan ; set it on a hot stove or coals ; stir the water 
with a stick until it runs rapidly around, then, having broken 
an egg into a cup, taking care not to break the yolk, drop it 
into the whirling water ; continue to stir it until the egg is 
cooked ; then take it into a dish with a skimmer, and set it 
over a pot of boiling water ; boil one at a time, until you have 
enough. These will remain soft for a long time. 

Omelet au Natural. — Break eight or ten eggs into a basin ; 
add a small teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, with a 
tablespoonfulof cold water ; beat the whole well with a spoon 
or whisk. In the meantime put some fresh sweet butter into 
an omelet pan, and when it is nearly hot, put in an omelet ; 
while it is frying, with a skimmer-spoon raise the edges from 
the pan, that it may be properly done. When the eggs are 
set and one side is a fine brown, double it half over, and serve 
hot. These omelets should be put quite thin in the pan ; the 
butter required for each will be about the size of a small egg. 

Omelet in Batter. Fry an omelet ; when done, cut it in 
squares or diamonds ; dip each piece in batter made of two 
eggs and a pint of milk with enough wheat flour, and fry 
them in nice salted lard, to a delicate brown. Serve hot. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Four eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the eggs, and add the salt to 
them ; melt the butter in a saucepan. Turn in the beaten 
eggs, stir quickly over a hot fire for one minute, and serve. 

Omelet (splendid). — Six pggs, whites and yolks beaten sepa- 
rately, half pint milk, six teaspoons corn starch, one teaspoon 
baking powder, and a little salt ; add the whites, beaten to a 
stiff froth, last ; cook in a little butter. 




VEGETABIvES. 

Boiled Potatoes. — Old potatoes are better for being peeled 
and put in cold water an hour before being put over to boil. 
They should then be put into fresh cold water when set over 
the fire. New potatoes should always be put into boiling 
water, and it is best to prepare them just in time for cooking. 
Are better steamed than boiled. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Potatoes are not good for mashing un- 
til they are full grown ; peel them, and lay them in water for 
an hour or more before boiling, for mashing. 

Old potatoes, when unfit for plain boiling, may be served 
mashed. Cut out all imperfections, take off all the skin, and 
lay them in cold water for one hour or more ; then put them 
into a dinner-pot or stewpan, with a teaspoonful of salt ; 
cover the stewpan, and let them boil for half an hour, unless 
they are large, when three-quarters of an hour will be re 
quired ; when they are done, take them up with a skimmer 
into a wooden bowl or tray, and mash them fine with a pota- 
toe beetle ; melt a piece of butter, the size of a large egg, into 
half a pint of hot milk ; mix it with the mashed potatoes un- 
til it is thoroughly incorporated and a smooth mass ; then put 
it in a deep dish, smooth the top over, and mark it neatly with 
a knife ; put pepper over, and serve. The quantity of milk 
used must be in proportion to the quantity of potatoes. 

Mashed potatoes may be heaped on a flat dish ; make it in a 
crown or pineapple ; stick a sprig of green celery or parsley 
in the top ; or, first brown it before the fire or in an oven. 

Mashed potatoes may be made a highly ornamental dish. 
After shaping it, as taste may direct, trim the edge of the 
plate with a wreath of celery leaves or green parsley ; or, 
first brown the outside in an oven or before the fire. 

Fried Potatoes. — Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, 
as nearly the same size as possible ; make some butter or 
dripping quite hot in a frying-pan ; put in the potatoes, and 
fry them on both sides to a nice brown. When they are crisp 
and done, take them up, place them on a cloth before the fire, 



— 79 — 

to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, after 
spriiikKng them with salt. These are delicious with rump 
steak, and in France are frequently served thus as a break- 
fast dish. The remains of cold potatoes may also be sliced 
and fried by the above recipe, but the slices must be cut a 
little tJiicker. 

Broiled Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes in slices length- 
wise, quarter of an inch thick ; dip each slice in wheat flour, 
and lay them on a gridiron over a bright fire of coals ; when 
both sides are browned nicely, take them on a hot dish, put a 
bit of butter, pepper, and salt to taste, over, and serve hot. 

Potatoes and Cream. — Mince cold boiled potatoes fine ; put 
them into a spider, with melted butter in it ; let them fry a 
little in the butter, well covered ; then put in a fresh piece of 
butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour over cream 
or rich milk ; let it boil up once, and serve. 

Potato Puffs. —Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed 
potato. While hot, shape into balls about the size of an Qgg. 
Have a tin sheet well buttered, and place the balls on it. As 
soon as all are done, brush over with beaten egg. Brown in 
the»oven. When done, slip a knife under them and slide them 
upon a hot platter. Garnish with parsley, and serve imme- 
diately. 

Potato Snow. — Choose large white potatoes, as free from 
spots as possible ; boil them in their skins in salt and water 
until perfectly tender, drain and. dry them thoroughly by the 
side of the fire, and peel them. Put a hot dish before the fire, 
rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve on to this dish ; do 
not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and serve 
as hot as possible. 

Potato Border. — Six potatoes, three eggs, one tablespoonful 
of butter, one of salt, half a cupful of boiling milk. Pare, boil 
and mash the potatoes. When fine and light, add the butter, 
salt and pepper and two well-beaten eggs. Butter the border 
mould and pack the potato in it. Let this stand on the kitchen 
table ten minutes ; then turn out on a dish and brush over 
with one well-beaten egg. Brown in the oven. 

Whipped Potatoes. — Instead of mashing in the ordinary 
way, whip with a fork until light and dry ; then whip in a 
little melted butter, some milk, and salt to taste, whipping 



— 80 — 

rapidly until creamy. Pile as lightly and irregularly as you 
can in a hot dish. 

Scalloped Potatoes. — Prepare in this proportion : Two 
cups of mashed potatoes, two tablespoonfuls of cream or 
milk, and one of melted butter ; salt and pepper to taste. Stir 
the potatoes, butter, and cream together, adding one raw egg. 
If the potatoes seem too moist, beat in a few fine bread-crumbs 
Bake in a hot oven for ten minutes, taking care to have the 
top a rich brown. 

Potato Croquettes. — Pare, boil, and mash six good-sized 
potatoes. Add one tablespoonful of butter, two-thirds of a 
cupful of hot cream or milk, the whites of two eggs well 
beaten, salt and pepper to taste. When cool enough to handle, 
w^ork into shape, roll in egg and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. 

Potatoes a la Creme. — Heat a cupful of milk ; stir in a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter cut up in as much flour. Stir 
until smooth and thick ; pepper and salt, and add two cupfuls 
of cold boiled potatoes, sliced, and a little very finely chopped 
parsley. Shake over the fire until the potatoes are hot all 
through, and pour into a deep dish. 

To Boil Sweet Potatoes. — Wash them perfectly clean, put 
them into a pot or stew-pan, and pour boiling water over to 
cover them ; cover the pot close, and boil fast for half an hour, 
or more if the potatoes are large ; try them with a fork ; when 
done, drain off the water, take off the skins, and serve. 

Cold sweet potatoes may be cut in slices across or length- 
wise, and fried or broiled as common potatoes ; or they may 
be cut in half and served cold. 

Roasted Sweet Potatoes. — Having washed them clean, and 
wiped them dry, roast them on a hot hearth as directed for 
common potatoes ; or put them in a Dutch oven or tin re- 
flector. Roasted or baked potatoes should not be cut, but 
broken open and eaten from the skin, as from a shell. 

To Bake Sweet Potatoes. — Wash them perfectly clean, 
wipe them dry, and bake in a quick oven, according to their 
size — half an hour for quite small size, three-quarters for 
larger, and a full liour for the largest. Let the oven have a 
good heat, and do not open it, unless it is necessary to turn 
them, until they are done. 



— 81 — 

French Fried Sweet Potatoes. — Prepare and fry the same 

as the white potatoes. Or they can first be boiled half an 
hour, and then pared, cut and fried as directed. The latter is 
the better way, as they are liable to be a little hard if fried 
when raw. 

Turnips. — Boil until tender ; mash and season with butter, 
pepper, salt, and a little rich milk or cream. 

Spinach. — An excellent way to serve spinach is to first look 
it over carefully ; wash it in two or three waters. If the 
stalks are not perfectly tender, cut the leaves from the stalk. 
Boil for twenty minutes in water with enough salt dissolved 
in it to salt the spinach sufficiently. When done let it drain, 
then chop it fine, put it on the stove in a saucepan, with a lump 
of butter, salt, and pepper, and enough milk to moisten it. 
When the butter is melted and the spinach steaming, take 
from the fire and put it in the dish in which it is going to the 
table. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in slices or in rings 
— that is, with the yolk removed and rings of the white onlv 
left. 

Beets. — Clean these nicely, but do not pare them, leaving 
on> a short piece of the stalk. Then put over to boil in hot 
water. Young beets will cook tender in an hour ; old beets 
require several hours' boiling. When done, skin quickly while 
hot, slice thin into your vegetable dish, put on salt, pepper, 
and a little butter, put over a little vinegar, and serve hot or 
cold. 

To Preserve Vegetables for Winter Use. — Green stringed 
beans must be picked when young ; put a layer three inches 
deep in a small wooden keg or half barrel ; sprinkle in salt 
an inch deep, then put another layer of beans, then salt, and 
beans and salt in alternate layers, until j^ou have enough ; let 
the last be salt ; cover them with a piece of board which will 
fit the inside of the barrel or keg, and place a heavy weight 
upon it ; they will make a brine. 

When wanted for use, soak them one night or more in 
plenty of water, changing it once or twice, until the salt is out 
of them, then cut them, and boil the same as when fresh. 

Carrots, beans, beet-roots, parsnips, and potatoes, keep best 
in dry sand or earth in a cellar ; turnips keep best on a cellar 
bottom, or they may be kept the same as carrots, etc. What- 



— 82 — 

ever earth remains about them when taken from the ground, 
should not be taken off. 

When sprouts come on potatoes or other stored vegetables, 
they should be carefully cut off. The young sprouts from 
turnips are sometimes served as a salad, or boiled tender in 
salt and water, and served with butter and pepper over. 

Celery may be kept all winter by setting it in boxes filled 
with earth ; keep it in the cellar ; it will grow and whiten in 
the dark ; leeks may also be kept in this way. 

Cabbage set out in earth, in a good cellar, will keep good 
and fresh all winter. Small close heads of cabbage may be 
kept many weeks by taking them before the frost comes, and 
laying them on a stone floor ; this will whiten them, and make 
them tender. 

Store onions are to be strung, and hung in a dry, cold place. 

Delicate Cabbage. — Remove all defective leaves, quarter 
and cut as for coarse slaw, cover well with cold water, and let 
remain several hours before cooking, then drain and put into 
])ot with enough boiling water to cover ; boil until thoroughly 
cooked (which will generally require about forty -five min- 
utes), add salt ten or fifteen minutes before removing from 
fire, and when done, take up into a colander, press out the 
water well, and season with butter and pepper. This is a good 
dish to serve with corned meats, but should not be cooked 
Avith them ; if preferred, however, it may be seasoned by add- 
ing some of the liquor and fat from the boiling meat to the 
cabbage while cooking. Drain, remove, and serve in a dish 
with drawn butter or a cream dressing poured over it. 

Red Cabbage. — Select two small, solid heads of hard red 
cabbage ; divide them in halves from crown to stem ; lay the 
split side down, and cut downwards in thin slices. The cab- 
bage w^ill then be in narrow strips or shreds. Put into a 
saucepan a tablespoon of clean drippings, butter, or any nice 
fat ; when fat is hot, put in cabbage, a teaspoon of salt, three 
tablespoons vinegar (if the latter is very strong, use but two), 
and one onion, in which three or four cloves have been stuck, 
buried in the middle ; boil two hours and a half ; if it becomes 
too dry and is in danger of scorching, add a very Utile water. 
This is very nice. 



— 83- 

Cauliflower. — Boil a fine cauliflower, tied up snugly in coarse 
tarlatan, in hot water, a little salt. Drain and lay in a deep 
dish, flower uppermost. Heat a cup of inilk ; thicken with two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits, and rolled in flour. Add 
pepper, salt, the beaten white of an egg, and boil up one min- 
ute, stirring well. Take from the fire, squeeze the juice of a 
lemon through a hair sieve into the sauce, and pour half into 
a boat, the rest over the cauliflower. 

Mashed Carrots. — Scrape, wash, lay in cold water half an 
hour ; then cook tender in boiling water. Drain well, mash 
with a wooden spoon, or beetle, work in a good piece of butter, 
and season witli pepper and salt. Heap up in a vegetable dish, 
and serve very hot. 

Boiled Green Corn. — Choose young sugar-corn, full grown, 
but not hard ; test with the nail. When the grain is pierced, 
the milk should escape in a jet, and not be thick. Clean by 
stripping off the outer leaves, turn back the innermost cover- 
ing carefully, pick off every thread of silk, and re-cover the 
ear with the thin husk that grew nearest it. Tie at the top 
with a bit of thread, put into boiling water salted, and cook 
fast from twenty minutes to half an hour, in proportion to 
si«e and age. Cut off the stalks close to the cob, and send 
whole to table wrapped in a napkin. 

Or you can cut from the cob while hot and season with 
butter, pepper, and salt. Send to table in a vegetable dish. 

Green Peas. — Shell and lay in cold water fifteen minutes. 
Cook from twenty to twenty-five minutes in boiling salted 
water. Drain, put into a deep dish with a good lump of but- 
ter ; pepper and salt to taste. 

To Boil Onions. — Take off the tops and tails, and the thin 
outer skin ; but no more, lest the onions should go to pieces. 
Lay them on the bottom of a pan wliich is broad enough to 
contain them without piling one on another ; just cover them 
with water, and let them simmer slowly till they are tender 
all through, but not till they break. 

Serve them up with melted butter. 

Fried Onions. — Cut them in thin slices and season them ; 
have a piece of fat bacon frying to get the juice, take it out, 
and put the onions in and stir until a pretty brown. 



— 84 — 

Boiled Parsnips. — Wash the parsnips, scrape them thor- 
oughly, and, with the point of the knife, remove any black 
specks about thein, and, should they' be very large, cut the 
thick part into quarters. Put them into a saucepan of boiling 
water, salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly until 
tender, which maybe ascertained by thrusting a fork in them; 
take them up, drain them, and serve in a vegetable dish. This 
vegetable is usually served with salt fish, boiled pork, or boiled 
beef ; when sent to table with the latter, a few should be placed 
alternately with carrots round the dish as a garnish. 

Parsnips Fried in Butter. — Scrape the parsnips and boil 
gently forty-five minutes. When cold, cut in long slices about 
one-third of an inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Dip 
in melted butter and in flour. Have two tablespoonfuls of 
butter in the frying-pan, and as soon as hot, put in enough 
parsnips to cover the bottom. Fry brown on both sides, and 
serve on a hot dish. 

Creamed Parsnips. — Boil tender, scrape, and slice length- 
wise. Put over the fire with two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
pepper, and salt, and a little minced parsley. Shake until the 
mixture boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce three table- 
spoonfuls of cream in which has been stirred a quarter spoon- 
ful of flour. Boil once, and pour over the parsnips. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Boil four or five parsnips ; when tender, 
take off the skin and mash them fine, add to them a teaspoon- 
ful of wheat flour and a beaten egg ; put a tablespoonful of 
lard or beef dripping in a frying-pan over the fire, add to it a 
saltspoonf ul of salt ; when boiling hot, put in the parsnips, 
make it in small cakes with a spoon ; when one side is a deli- 
cate brown, turn the other ; when both are done, take them on 
a dish, put a very little of the fat in which they were fried 
over, and serve hot. These resemble very nearly the taste of 
the salsify or oyster plant, and will generally be preferred. 

Salsify, or Vegetable Oyster. — Boil and serve as directed 
for parsnips ; either plain boiled, or fried, or made fritters. 

Boiled Vegetable Marrow. — Have ready a saucepan of boil- 
ing water, properly salted ; put in the marrows after peeling 
them, and boil them until quite tender. Take them up with a 
slice ; halve, and, should they be very large, quarter them. 



— 85 — 

Dish them on toast, and send to table with them a tureen of 
melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt butter. 
Large vegetable marrows may be preserved throughout the 
winter by storing them in a dry place ; when wanted for use, 
a few slices should be cut and boiled in the same manner as 
above ; but, when once begun, the marrow must be eaten 
quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is cut. Vegeta- 
ble marrows are also very delicious mashed : they should be 
boiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly with a wooden 
spoon. Heat them in a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and 
pepper, and a small piece of butter, and dish with a few snip- 
pets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish. 

Vegetable marrows are delightful when sliced and fried for 
ten minutes in butter. Before being fried they may be dipped 
in a batter of flour and water, seasoned with a little salt. Veg- 
etable marrows may be also dressed as follows : Boil one, and 
when it is about ready cut it in pieces, which place in a fresh 
saucepan, covered with soup stock, either white or brown; add 
a little salt in stewing. Serve in a deep dish when thoroughly 
tender. Vegetable marrows are very nice plain boiled, and 
served upon buttered toast. Peel them and cut them so as to 
be able to remove the seeds. Marrows will take from twenty 
minutes to an hour to boil, according to size and age. After 
being parboiled, they may be sliced down, dipped in egg, and 
then rubbed among bread crumbs, and fried, serve them as hot 
as possible. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over six or eight 
large tomatoes, or a greater number of small ones ; let them 
remain for a few minutes, then peel off the skins, squeeze out 
the seeds and some of the juice, by pressing them gently in 
the hand ; put them in a well tinned stewpan, with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, a bit of butter, half 
as large as an egg, and a tablespoonful of grated bread or 
rolled crackers ; cover the stewpan close, and set it over the 
fire for nearly an hour ; shake the stewpan occasionally, that 
they may not burn ; serve hot. 

This is decidedly the best manner of stewing tomatoes ; they 
may be done without the breadcrumbs, and with less stewing 
if preferred. 



— 8G — 

Baked Tomatoes. — Wash five or six smooth tomatoes ; cut 
a piece from the stem end, the size of •a twenty-five cent piece; 
put a saltspoonf ul of salt, half as much pepper, and a bit of but- 
ter the size of a nutmeg, in eacli ; set them in a dish or pan. 
and bake in a moderate oven for nearly one hour. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Twelve large, smooth tomatoes, one 
teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, one of sugar, one cupful of bread crumbs, one teaspoonful 
of onion juice. Arrange the tomatoes in a baking pan. Cut 
a thin slice from the smooth end of each. With a small spoon, 
scoop out as much of the pulp and juice as possible without 
injuring the shape. When all have been treated in this wa}', 
mix the pulp and juice with the other ingredients, and fill the 
tomatoes with this mixture. Put on the tops, and bake slowly 
three-quarters of an hour. Slide the cake turner under the 
tomatoes and lift gently on to a flat dish. Garnish with pars- 
ley, and serve. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. — Turn nearly all the juice off from a 
ean of tomatoes. Salt and pepper this, by the way, and put 
aside in a cool place for some other day's soup. Put a layer of 
bread crumbs in the bottom of a buttered pie-dish ; on them 
one of tomatoes ; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and some bits of 
butter, also a little sugar. Another layer of crumbs, another 
of tomatoes — seasoned — then a top layer of very fine, dry 
crumbs. Bake covered until bubbling hot, and brown 
quickly. 

To Peel Tomatoes. — Put the tomatoes in a frying basket 
and plunge them into boiling water for about three minutes. 
Drain and peel. 

Tomatoes may be sliced thin, and served with salt, pepper, 
and vinegar over, for breakfast ; or sliced, and strewn with 
sugar and grated nutmeg, for tea ; for dinner they may be 
stewed or broiled, or baked. 

Tomatoes may be preserved in sugar, or as catsup, when 
out of season. Such as like them, declare them to be equally 
excellent in each and every form or dressing. 

Baked Beans. — Pick one quart of beans free from stones 
and dirt. Wash, and soak in cold water over night. In the 
morning pour off the water. Cover with hot water, put two 



— 87 — 

pounds of corned beef with them, and boil until they begin to 
split open (the time depends upon the age of the beans, but it 
will be from thirty to sixty minutes). Turn them into the 
colander, and pour over them two or three quarts of cold wa- 
ter. Put about half of the beans in a deep earthen pot, then 
put in the beef, and finally the remainder of the beans. Mix 
one teaspoonful of mustard and one tablespoonful of molasses 
with a little water. Pour this over the beans, and then add 
boiling water to just cover. Bake slowly ten hours. Add a 
little water occasionally. 

String Beans. — String, snap and wash two quarts beans, 
boil in plenty of water about fifteen minutes, drain off and 
put on again in about two quarts of boiling water ; boil an 
hour and a half, and add salt and pepper just before taking 
up, stirring in one and a half tablespoons butter rubbed into 
two tablespoons flour and half pint sweet cream. Or boil a 
piece of salted pork one hour, then add beans and boil an hour 
and a half. For shelled beans boil half an hour in water 
enough to cover, and dress as above. 

Butter Beans. — With a knife cut off the ends of pods and 
string from both sides, being very careful to remove every 
shred ; cut every bean lengthwise, in two or three strips, and 
leave them for half an hour in cold water. Much more than 
cover them with boiling water ; boil till perfectly tender. It is 
well to allow three hours for boiling. Drain well, return to 
kettle, and add a dressing of half a gill cream, one and a half 
ounces butter, one even teaspoon salt, and half a teaspoon pep- 
per. This is sufficient for a quart of cooked beans. 

Asparagus with Eggs.— Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty 
minutes ; cut off the tender tops, and lay in a deep pie-plate, 
buttering, salting, and peppering well. Beat four eggs just 
enough to break up the yolks, add a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, with pepper and salt, and pour upon the asparagus. 
Bake eight minutes in a quick oven, and serve immediately. 

Asparagus upon Toast.— Tie the bunch of asparagus up 
with soft string, when you have cut away the wood, and cook 
about twenty-five minutes in salted boiling water. Have 
ready some slices of crustless toast ; dip each in the asparagus 
liquor ; butter well while hot, and lay upon a heated dish 



— 88 — 

Drain the asparagus, and arrange upon the toast. Pepper, 
salt, and butter generously. 

Mushrooms, Stewed. — If fresh, let them lie in salt and 
water about one hour, then put them in the stewpan, cover 
with water, and let them cook two hours gently. Dress them 
with cream, butter and flour, as oysters, and season to taste. 

Mushrooms, Fried. When peeled, put them into hot but- 
ter, and let them heat thoroughly through — too much cooking 
toughens them. Season well with butter, pepper, and salt. 
Serve on buttered toast ; a teaspoonful of wine or vinegar on 
each mushroom is a choice method. 

Baked Mushrooms. — Place some large flat ones, nicely 
cleaned and trimmed, on thin slices of well buttered toast, 
putting a little nudgel of butter in each, as also a snuff of 
pepper and salt ; lay them on a baking tray, and cover them 
carefully ; heap the hot ashes upon them, and let them bake 
on the hearth for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — Choose the largest sort, lay them on 
a small gridiron over bright coals, the stalk upward. Broil 
quickly, and serve, with butter, pepper, and salt over. 

Mashed Squash. — Peel, seed and slice fresh summer 
squashes. Lay in cold water ten minutes ; put into boiling 
water, a little salt, and cook tender. Twenty minutes will 
suffice if the squash be young. Mash in a colander, pressing 
out all the water ; heap in a deep dish, seasoning with pepper, 
salt and butter. Serve hot. 

Baked Squash. — Cut in pieces, scrape well, bake from one 
to one and a half hours, according to the thickness of the 
squash. To be eaten with salt and butter, as sweet potatoes. 

Fried Squashes. — Cut the squash into thin slices, and 
sprinkle it with salt ; let it stand a few moments, then beat 
two eggs, and dip the squash into the egg ; then fry it brown 
in butter. 

Stewed Celery.— Is an excellent winter dish, and is very 
easily cooked. Wash the stalks thoroughly, and boil in well 
salted water till tender, which will be in about twenty min- 
utes. After it is made ready, as above, drain it thoroughly, 
place it on toasted bread, and pour over it a quantity of sauce. 



— 80 — 

A sauce of cream, seasoned with a little mace, may be served 
over the celery. It may also be served with melted butter. 

Stuffed Egg-plant. — Cut the egg-plant in two, scrape out 
all the inside, and put it in a saucepan, with a little minced 
ham ; cover with water, and boil until soft ; drain off the 
water ; add two tablespoonfuls grated crumbs, tablespoonful 
butter, half a minced onion, salt and pepper ; stuff each half 
of the hull with the mixture ; add a lump of butter to each, 
and bake fifteen minutes. 



SAUCES FOR IVIEAXS, KISH, POTJIvTRY 
OR VKOEXABIvES. 

To Make Drawn Butter — Put half a pint of milk in a per- 
fectly clean stewpan, and set it over a moderate fire ; put into 
a pint bowl a heaping tablespoonful of wheat flour, quarter 
of a pound of sweet butter, and a saltspoonful of salt ; work 
these well together with the back of the spoon, then pour into 
it, stirring it all the time, half a pint of boiling water ; when 
it is smooth, stir it into the boiling milk, let it simmer for five 
minutes or more, and it is done. 

Drawn butter made after this recipe will be found to be 
most excellent ; it may be made less rich by using less butter. 

Parsley Sauce. — Make a drawn butter as directed, dip a 
bunch of parsley into boiling water, then cut it fine, and stir 
into the drawn butter a few minutes before taking it up. 

Egg Sauce. — Make a drawn butter ; chop two hard-boiled 
eggs quite fine, the white and yolk separately, and stir it into 
the sauce before serving. This is used for boiled fish or vege- 
tables. 

Onion Sauce. — Peel some nice white onions, and boil them 
tender ; press the water from them ; chop them fine, and put 
them to a half pint of hot milk ; add a bit of butter and a 
teaspoonful of salt, and pepper to taste. Serve with boiled 
veal, or poultry, or mutton. 



— 90 — 

Anchovy Sauce, — Make the butter sauce, and stir into it 
four tablespoonfuls of essence of anchovy and one of lemon 
juice. 

Bread Sauce. — One pint milk, one cup bread-crumbs (very 
fine), one onion, sliced, a pinch of mace, pepper and salt to 
taste, three tablespoonfuls butter. Simmer the sliced onion in 
the milk until tender ; strain tlie milk, and pour over the 
bread-crumbs, which should be put into a saucepan. Cover 
and soak half an hour ; beat smooth with an egg-whip, add 
the seasoning and butter ; stir in well, boil up once, and serve 
in a tureen. If it is too thick, add boiling water and more 
butter. 

This sauce is for roast poultry. Some people add some of 
the gravy from the dripping-pan. first straining it, and beat- 
ing it well in with the sauce. 

Tomato Sauce. — Can be cheaply made either from the fresh 
fruit, or from the canned tomatoes, which are on sale in every 
grocer's shop. Squeeze as much as you require through a 
sieve, and then simmer slowly for a little time in a few table- 
spoonfuls of beef gravy ; season with pepper and salt. Ex- 
cellent for chops and cutlets, or for roasted beef. 

Tomato Mustard. — One peck of ripe tomatoes ; boiled with 
two onions, six red peppers, four cloves of garlic, for one 
hour ; then add a half-pint or half-pound salt, three table 
spoons black pepper, half-ounce ginger, half -ounce allspice, 
half-ounce mace, half-ounce cloves ; then boil again for one 
hour longer, and when cold add one pint of vinegar and a 
quarter pound of mustard ; and if you like it very hot, a 
tablespoonfui of cayenne. 

Mint Sauce. — Mix one tablespoon of white sugar to half a 
teacup of good vinegar ; add the mint, and let it infuse for 
half an hour in a cool place before sending to the table. 
Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

Celery Sauce. — Mix two tablespoons of flour with half a 
teacup of butter ; have ready a pint of boiling milk ; stir the 
flour and butter into the milk ; take three heads of celery, 
cut into small bits, and boil for a few minutes in water, which 
strain off ; put the celery into the melted butter, and keep it 
stirred over the fire for five or ten minutes. This is very nice 
with boiled fowl or turkey. 



— 91 — 

Governor's Sauce. — One peck green tomatoes, four large 
onions, six red peppers, one teacup grated horseradish, one 
teaspoon cayenne and one of black pepper, one teaspoon mus- 
tard, half cup sugar ; slice the tomatoes, and sprinkle one tea- 
cup salt on, and lay all night ; drain well in the morning, then 
simmer all together till cooked through. 

Cream Sauce. — One cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of flour 
and a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper. Put the but- 
ter in a small frying-pan, and when hot, but not brown, add 
the flour. Stir until smooth ; then gradually add the milk. 
Let it boil up once. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and 
serve. This is nice to cut cold potatoes into and let them just 
heat through. They are then creamed potatoes. It also 
answers as a sauce for other vegetables, omelets, fish and 
sweetbreads, or, indeed, for anything that requires a white 
sauce. If you have plenty of cream, use it, and omit the 
butter. 

Russian Sauce. — (Piquant) may be thus made : Grated 
horseradish four tablespoonfuls, weak mustard one spoonful, 
sugar half a spoonful, a little salt, two or three grains of 
cayenne, and a spoonful or two of vinegar. Mix thoroughly, 
and feerve to cold meat. When wanted for fish, let it be added 
to melted butter — two parts butter to one of sauce. 

Mayonnaise Sauce. — Mix in a two-quart bowl one even tea- 
spoon ground mustard, one of salt, and one and a half of vin- 
egar ; beat in the yolk of a raw egg, then add very gradually 
half a pint pure olive oil (or melted butter), beating briskly all 
the time. The mixture will become a very thick batter. 
Flavor with vinegar or fresh lemon-juice. Closely covered, it 
will keep for weeks in a cold place, and is delicious. 

Oyster Sauce. — Take a pint of oysters, and save out a little 
of their liquor. Put them with their remaining liquor, and 
some mace and nutmeg, into a covered saucepan, and simmer 
them on hot coals about ten minutes. Then drain them. 
Oysters for sauce should be large. Having prepared in a 
saucepan some drawn or melted butter (mixed with oyster 
liquor instead of water), pour it into a sauce-boat, add the 
oysters to it, and serve it up with boiled poultry, or with boiled 
fresh fish. Celery, first boiled and then chopped, is an im- 
provement to oyster sauce. 



— [)2 — 

Lobster Sauce. — Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lob- 
ster into a mortar, with a tablespoonful of butter, pound it to 
a smootli mass, then rub it through a sieve ; melt nearly a 
quarter of a pound of sweet butter, with a wineglass of water, 
or vinegar ; add a teaspoonful of made mustard, stir in the 
coral and spawn, and a little salt and pepper ; stir it until it is 
smooth, and serve. Some of the meat of the lobster may be 
chopped fine, and stirred into it. 

Caper Sauce. — Make a butter sauce, and stir into it one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice, two of capers, and one of essence 
of anchovy. 

Mustard Sauce. — Stir three tablespoonfuls of mixed mus- 
tard and a speck of cayenne into a butter sauce. This is nice 
for devilled turkey and broiled smoked herrings. 

Curry Sauce. — One tablespoonful of butter, one of flour, one 
teaspoonful of curry powder, one large slice of onion, one 
large cupful of stock, salt and pepper to taste. Cut the onion 
fine, and fry brown in the butter. Add the flour and curry 
powder. Stir for one minute, add the stock, and season with 
the salt and pepper. Simmer five minutes ; then strain, and 
serve. This sauce can be served with a broil or saute of meat 
or fish. 

Cranberry Sauce. — After removing all soft berries, wash 
thoroughly, place for about two minutes in scalding water, 
remove, and to every pound of fruit add three-quarters of a 
pound granulated sugar and a half pint water ; stew together 
over a moderate but steady fire. Be careful to cover and not 
to stir the fruit, but occasionally shake the vessel, or apply a 
gentler heat if in danger of sticking or burning. If attention 
to these particulars be given, the berries will retain their shape 
to a considerable extent, which adds greatly to their appear- 
ance on the table. Boil from five to seven minutes, remove 
from fire, turn into a deep dish, and set aside to cool. If to be 
kept, they can be put up at once in air-tight jars. Or, for 
strained sauce, one and a half pounds of fruit should be stewed 
in one pint of water for ten or twelve minutes, or until quite 
soft, then strained through a colander or fine wire sieve, and 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar thoroughly stirred into the 
pulp thus obtained ; after cooling it is ready for use. Serve 
with roast turkey or game. When to be kept for a long time 



— 93 — 

without sealing, more sugar may be added, but its too free 
use impairs the peculiar cranberry flavor. For dinner sauce 
half a pound is more economical, and really preferable to 
three-quarters, as given above. It is better, though not neces- 
sary, to use a porcelain kettle. Some prefer not to add the 
sugar till the fruit is almost done, thinking this plan makes it 
more tender, and preserves the color better. 

Port Wine Sauce for Game. — Half a tumbler of currant 
jelly, half a tumbler of port wine, half a tumbler of stock, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, four 
cloves, a speck of cayenne. Simmer the cloves and stock 
together for half an hour. Strain on the other ingredients, 
and let all melt together. Part of the gravy from the game 
may be added to it. 

Currant Jelly Sauce. — Three tablespoonfuls of butter, one 
onion, one bay leaf, one sprig of celery, two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, half a cupful of currant jelly, one tablespoonful of 
flour, one pint of stock, salt, pepper. Cook the butter and 
onion until the latter begins to color. Add the flour and herbs. 
Stir until brown ; add the stock ; and simmer twenty minutes. 
Strain, and skim off all the fat. Add the jelly, and stir over 
the *fire until it is melted. Serve with game. 

Apple Sauce. — Peel, quarter, and core, rich tart apples ; put 
to them a very little water, cover them, and set them over the 
fire ; when tender, mash them smooth, and serve with roasted 
pork, goose, or any otiier gross meat. 




BREAD AND BREAKFAST CAKES. 

Plain White Family Bread.— Take one pint of flour and 
half a pint of good hop yeast and stir it together about five 
o'clock in the afternoon ; at nine put one-half gallon of flour 
in a tray, put the sponge in the middle of the flour with a piece 
of lard as large as a walnut. Knead it all up with tepid water 
made salt with two teaspoonfuls or more to taste ; work it 
well, and put it in a jar to rise. Next morning knead it over 
with a little flour, make it in two loaves, and* set it in a warm 
place or oven until ready • then put it to bake, and when done, 
wrap it in a nice coarse towel. If you have no sugar in the 
yeast you use, stir a large teaspoonful in it before putting it 
in the flour 

Graham Bread. — Take a little over a quart of warm water, 
one-half cup brown sugar or molasses, one-fourth cup hop 
yeast, and one and one-half teaspoons salt ; thicken the water 
with unbolted flour to a thin batter ; add sugar, salt and yeast, 
and stir in more flour until quite stiff. In the morning add a 
small teaspoon soda, and flour enough to make the batter stiff 
as can be stirred with a spoon ; put it into pans and let rise 
again ; then bake in even oven, not too hot at first ; keep 
ivarm tvhile rising j smooth over the loaves with a spoon or 
knife dipped in water, 

Boston Brown Bread. — One heaping coffee-cup each of 
corn, rye and Graham meal. The rye meal should be as fine 
as the Graham, or rye flour may be used. Sift the three kinds 
together as closely as possible, and beat together thoroughly 
with two cups New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses, two cups 
sweet milk, one cup sour milk, one dessert spoon soda, one tea- 
spoon salt ; pour into a tin form, place in a kettle of cold wa- 
ter, put on and boil four hours. Put on to cook as soon as 
mixed. It may appear to be too thin, but it is not, as this 
recipe has never been known to fail. Serve warm, with baked 
beans or Thanksgiving turkey. The bread should not quite 
fill the form (or a tin pail with cover will answer), as it must 
have room to swell. See that the water does not boil up to 



— 95 — 

the top of the form ; also take care it does not boil entirely 
away or stop boiling. To sei've it, remove the lid and set it a 
few moments into the open oven to dry the top, and it will 
then turn out in perfect shape. This bread can be used as a 
pudding, and served with a sauce made of thick sour cream, 
well sweetened and seasoned with nutmeg ; or it is good 
toasted the next day. 

Corn Bread. — Sift three quarts of corn meal, add a table- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful baking-powder, and mix 
sufficient water with it to make a thin batter. Cover it with 
a bread-cloth and set it to rise. When ready to bake stir it 
well, pour it into a baking-pan, and bake slowly. Use cold 
water in summer and hot water in winter. 

Steamed Brown Bread. — One quart each of milk and In- 
dian meal, one pint rye meal, one cup of molasses, two tea- 
spoonfuls of soda. Add a little salt and steam four hours. 

Parker House Rolls. — One teacup home-made yeast, a little 
salt, one tablespoon sugar, a piece of lard size of an egg, one 
pint milk, flour sufficient to mix. Put the milk on the stove 
to scald with the lard in it. Prepare the flour with salt, sugar 
and yeast. Then add the milk, not too hot. Knead thor- 
ouglily when mixed at night ; in the morning but very slight 
kneading is necessary. Then roll out and cut with large bis- 
cuit cutter. Spread a little butter on each roll and lap to- 
gether. Let them rise very light, then bake in a quick oven. 

French Rolls. — One pint of milk, scalded ; put into it while 
hot half a. cup of sugar and one tablespoon of butter. When 
the milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cup of yeast, or 
one compressed yeast cake ; stir in flour to make a stiff 
sponge, and when light,' mix as for bread. Let it rise until 
light, punch it down with the hand, and let it rise again — re- 
peat two or three times ; then turn the dough on to the mould- 
ing-board and pound with the rolling-pin until thin enough to 
cut. Cut out with a tumbler, brush the surface of each one 
with melted butter, and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the 
tins ; bake, and while warm brush over the surface with 
melted butter to make the crust tender. 

Buns. — Break one egg into a cup and fill with sweet milk ; 
mix with it half cup yeast, half cup butter, one cup sugar, 
enough flour to make a soft dough ; flavor with nutmeg. Let 



— 90 — 

rise till very light, then mold into biscuit with a few currants. 
Let rise 'a second time in pan ; bake, and when nearly done, 
glaze with a little molasses and mirk. Use the same cup, no 
matter about the size, for each measure. 

Biscuit. — Dissolve one rounded tablespoon of butter in a pint 
of hot milk ; when lukewarm stir in one quart of flour ; add 
one beaten egg, a little salt, and a tea cup of yeast ; work into 
dough until smooth. If winter, set in a warm place ; if sum- 
mer, in a cool one to rise. In the morning work softly and 
roll out one-half inch and cut into biscuit and set to rise for 
thirty minutes, when they will be ready to bake. These are 
delicious. 

To Make Rusks. — To every pound of flour allow two ounces 
of butter, one-quarter pint of milk, two ounces of loaf sugar, 
three eggs, one tablespoonful of yeast. Put the milk and but- 
ter into a saucepan, and keep shaking it round until the latter 
is melted. Put the flour into a basin with the sugar, mix these 
well together, and beat the eggs. Stir them with the yeast to 
the milk and butter, and with this liquid work the flour inta 
a smooth dough. Cover a cloth over the basin, and leave the 
dough to rise by the side of the fire ; then knead it, and divide 
it into twelve pieces ; place them in a brisk oven, and bake for 
about twenty minutes. Take the rusks out, break them in 
half, and then set them in the oven to get crisp on the other 
side. When cold, they should be put into tin canisters to keep 
them dry ; and, if intended for the cheese course, the sifted 
sugar should be omitted. 

Sweet Milk Gems. — Beat one egg well, add a pint new milk, 
a little salt, and Graham flour until it will drop off the spoon 
nicely ; heat and butter the gem-pans before dropping in the 
dough ; bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. 

Breakfast Gems. — One cup sweet milk, one and a half cups 
flour one egg, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon baking powder, 
beaten together flve minutes ; bake in hot gem-pans in a hot 
oven about fifteen minutes. 

Graham Breakfast Cakes. — Two cups of Graham flour, one 
cup of wheat flour, two eggs well beaten ; mix with sweet 
milk, to make a very thin batter ; bake in gem irons ; have 
the irons hot, then set them on the upper grate in the oven j 
will bake in fifteen minutes. 



— 07 — 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One quart buckwheat flour ; four table- 
spoonfuls yeast ; one teaspoonful salt ; one handful Indian 
meal ; two tablespoonfuls molasses — not syrup. Warm water 
enoug-li to make a thin batter. Beat very well and set to rise 
in a warm place. If the batter is in the least sour in the morn- 
ing, stir in a very little soda dissolved in hot water. Mix in 
an earthen crock, and leave some in the bottom each morning 
— a cupful or so — to serve as sponge for the next night instead 
of getting fresh yeast. In cold weather this plan can be suc- 
cessfully pursued for a week or ten days without setting a new 
supply. Of course you add the usual quantity of flour, etc., 
every night, and beat up well. Do not make your cakes too 
small. Buckwheats should be of generous size. Some put 
two-thirds buckwheat, one-third oatmeal, omitting the In- 
dian. 

Flannel Cakes. — Beat six eggs very light, stir in them two 
pounds of flour, one gill of yeast, small spoonful of salt, and 
sufficient milk to make a thick batter. Make them at night 
for breakfast, ajid at ten in the morning for tea. Have your 
griddle hot, grease it well, and bake as buckwheat. Butter 
a,nd send them hot to the table, commencing after the family 
are seated. 

Rice Griddle-Cakes. — Boil half a cup rice ; when cold mix 
one quart sweet milk, the yolks of four eggs, and flour suffi- 
cient to make a stiff batter ; beat the whites to a froth, stir in 
one teaspoon soda, and two of cream tartar ; add a little salt, 
and lastly, the whites of eggs ; bake on a griddle. A nice way 
to serve is to spread them while hot with butter, and almost 
any kind of preserves or jelly ; roll them up neatly, cut off the 
ends, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve immediately. 

French Pancakes. — Two eggs, two ounces of butter, two 
ovmces of sifted sugar, two ounces of flour, half pint of new 
milk. Beat the eggs thoroughly, and put them into a basin 
with the butter, which should be beaten to a cream ; stir in 
the sugar and flour, and when these ingredients are well mixed, 
add the milk ; keep stirring and beating the mixture for a 
few minutes ; put it on buttered plates, and bake in a quick 
oven for twenty minutes. Serve with a cut lemon and sifted 
-sugar, or pile the pancakes high on a dish, with a layer of pre- 
serve or marmalade between each. 



— 98 — 

Pancakes. — Two cups of prepared flour ; si^' eggs; one salt- 
spoonful of salt ; milk to make a thin batter. Beat the eggs 
light ; add salt, two cups of milk, then the whites and flour 
alternately with milk, until the batter is of the right consis- 
tency. Run a spoonful of lard over the bottom of a hot fry- 
ing-pan, pour in a large ladleful of batter, and fry quickly. 
Roll the pancake up like a sheet of paper ; lay upon a hot 
dish ; put in more lard, and fry another pancake. Keep hot 
over boiling water, sending half a dozen to the table at a time. 

Bread Fritters.— One quart milk — boiling hot ; two cups 
fine bread crumbs ; three eggs ; one teaspoonf ul nutmeg ; one 
tablespoonful butter — melted ; one saltspoonful salt, and the 
same of soda, dissolved in hot water. Soak the bread in the 
boiling milk ten minutes, in a covered bowl. Beat to a smooth 
paste; add the whipped yolks, the butter, salt, soda, and finally 
the whites, whipped stiff. 

Quick Sally Lunn. — One cup of sugar, half cup of butter ; 
stir well together, and then add one or two eggs ; put in one 
good pint of sweet milk, and with sufficient flour to make a 
batter about as stifl" as cake ; put in three teaspoons of bak- 
ing-powder ; bake and eat hot with butter, for tea or break- 
fast. 

Breakfast Cake. — One pint of flour, three tablespoons of 
butter, three tablespoons of sugar, one egg, one cup sweet 
milk, one teaspoon cream tartar, half teaspoon soda ; to be 
eaten with butter. 

Quick Waffles. — Two pints sweet milk, one cup butter 
(melted), sifted flour to make a soft batter ; add the well- 
beaten yolks of six eggs, then the beaten whites, and lastly 
(just before baking) four teaspoons baking-powder, beating 
very hard and fast for a few minutes. These are very good 
with four or five eggs, but much better with more. 

Johnny Cake. — Two-thirds teaspoon soda, three tablespoons 
sugar, one teaspoon cream tartar, one egg, one cup sweet 
milk, six tablespoonfuls Indian meal, three tablespoonfuls 
flour, and a little salt. This makes a thin batter. 

Mush. — Indian or oatmeal mush is best made in the follow- 
ing manner : Put fresh water in a kettle over the fire to boil, 
and put in some salt ; when the water boils, stir in handful by 
handful corn or oatmeal until thick enough for use. In order 



— 99 — 

to have excellent mush, the meal should be allowed to cook 
well, and long as possible while thin, and before the final hand- 
ful is added. When desired to be fried for breakfast, turn 
into an earthen dish and set away to cool. Then cut in slices 
when you wish to fry ; dip each piece in beaten eggs and fry 
■on a hot griddle. 

Corn Mush. — Put four quarts fresh water in a kettle to 
boil, salt to suit the taste ; when it begins to boil stir in one 
and a half quarts meal, letting it sift through the fingers 
slowly to prevent lumps, adding it a little faster at the last, 
until as thick as can be conveniently stirred with one hand ; 
set in the oven in the kettle (or take out into a pan), bake an 
hour, and it will be thoroughly cooked. It takes corn meal 
so long to cook thoroughly that it is very difficult to boil it 
until done without burning. Excellent for frying when cold. 
Use a hard wood paddle, two feet long, with a blade two 
inches wide and seven inches long, to stir with. The thor- 
ough cooking and baking in oven afterwards takes away all 
the raw taste that mush is apt to have, and adds much to its 
sweetness and delicious flavor. 

Graham Mush. — Sift meal slowly into boiling salted water, 
stirring briskly until it is as thick as can be stirred with one 
hand ; serve with milk, or cream and sugar, or butter and 
syrup. It is much improved by removing from the kettle to 
-a pan as soon as thorougly mixed, and steaming for three or 
four hours. It may also be eaten cold, or sliced and fried, 
like corn mush.

. SALADS, PICKLES AND CATSUP. 

Lettuce. — The early lettuce and first fine salad, are five or 
six leaves in a cluster ; their early appearance is their great- 
est recommendation ; cabbage, or white-heart lettuce is later, 
and much more delicate ; break the leaves apart, one by one, 
from the stalk, and throw them into a pan of cold water; 
rinse them well, lay them into a salad bowl, or deep dish, lay 
the largest leaves first, put the next size upon them, then lay 
on the finest white leaves ; cut hard-boiled eggs in slices or 
quarters, and lay them at equal distances around the edge 
and over the salad ; serve with vinegar, oil, and made mus- 
tard in the castor. Or, having picked and washed the let- 
tuce, cut the leaves small ; put the cut salad in a glass dish or 
bowl, pour a salad dressing over, and serve ; or, garnish with 
small red radishes, cut in halves or slices, and hard-boiled 
eggs, cut in quarters or slices : pour a salad dressing over 
when ready to serve. Serve with boiled lobster, boiled fowls, 
or roasted lamb or veal. 

Lettuce Salad.— Take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, 
add salt and mustard to taste ; mash it fine ; make a paste by 
adding a dessert-spoon of olive oil or melted butter (use butter 
always when it is difficult to get fresh oil); mix thoroughly, 
and then dilute by adding gradually a teacup of vinegar, and 
pour over the lettuce. Garnish by slicing another egg, and 
laying over the lettuce. This is sufficient for a moderate-sized 
dish of lettuce. 

Salmon Salad. — One quart of cooked salmon, two heads of 
lettuce, two tablespoon fuls of lemon juice, one of vinegar, 
two of capers, one teaspoonful of salt, one-third of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, one cupful of mayonnaise dressing, or the 
French dressing. Break up the salmon with two silver forks. 
Add to it the salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice. Put in 
the ice-chest, or some other cold place, for two or three hours. 
Prepare the lettuce as directed for lobster salad. At serving 
time, pick out leaves enough to border the dish. Cut or tear 
the remainder in pieces, and arrange these in the centre of a 



— 101 — 



flat dish. On them heap the salmon lightly, and cover with 
the dressing. Now sprinkle on the capers. Arrange the 
whole leaves at the base, and, if you choose, lay one-fourth of 
a thin slice of lemon on each leaf. 

Lobster Salad - Put a large lobster over the fire in boiling 
water slightly salted ; boil rapidly for about twenty minutes ; 
when done it will be of a bright red color, and should be re- 
moved, as if boiled too long it will be tough ; when cold crack 
the claws, after first disjointing, twist off the head (which is 
used in garnishing), split the body in two, lengthwise, pick 
out the meat in bits not too fine, saving the coral separate ; 
cut up a large head of lettuce slightly, and place on a dish, 
over which lay the lobster, putting the coral around the out- 
side For dressing, take the yolks of three eggs, beat well, 
add four tablespoons salad oil, dropping it in very slowly, 
beating all the time ; then add a little salt, cayenne pepper, 
half teaspoon mixed mustard, and two tablespoons vinegar. 
Pour this over the lobster, just before sending to table. 

Tomato Salad.— Take the skin, juice and seeds from nice, 
fresh tomatoes, chop what remains with celery, and add a 
good salad dressing. 

Salad Dressing.— Yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, rubbed 
very fine and smooth, one teaspoon English mustard, one of 
salt the yolks of two raw eggs beaten into the other, dessert- 
spoon of fine sugar Add very fresh sweet oil, poured in by 
very small quantities, and beaten as long as the mixture con- 
tinues to thicken, then add vinegar till as thin as desired. If 
not hot enough with mustard, add a little cayenne pepper. 

Sardine Salad.— Arrange one quart of any kind of cooked 
fish on a bed of crisp lettuce. Split six sardines, and if there 
are any bones, remove them. Cover the fish with the sardine 
dressing. Over this put the sardines, having the ends meet 
in the centre of the dish. At the base of the dish make a 
wreath of thin slices of lemon. Garnish with parsley or let- 
tuce, and serve immediately. 

French Salad Dressing.— Three tablespoonfuls of oil one 
of vinegar, one saltspoonful of salt, one-half a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Put the salt and pepper in a cup, and add one table- 
spoonful of the oil. When thoroughly mixed, add the re- 
mainder of the oil and the vinegar. This is dressing enough 



— 10.'^ — 

for a salad for six persons. If you like the flavor of onion, 
grate a little juice into the dressing. . The juioe is obtained by 
first peeling the onion, and then grating with a coarse grater, 
using a good deal of pressure. Two strokes will give about 
two drops of juice. 

Cream Dressing for Cold Slaw.— Two tablespoons whipped 
sweet cream, two of sugar, and four of vinegar; beat well and 
pour over cabbage, previoush^ cut very fine and seasoned with 
salt. 

Chicken Salad. — Boil one chicken tender ; chop moderately 
fine the whites of twelve hard-boiled eggs and the chicken ; 
add equal quantities of chopped celery and cabbage ; mash 
the yolks fine, add two tablespoons butter, two of sugar, one 
teaspoon mustard ; pepper and salt to taste ; and lastly, one 
half -cup good cider vinegar ; pour over the salad, and mix 
thoroughly. If no celery is at hand, use chopped pickled cu- 
cumbers or lettuce and celery seed. This may be mixed two 
or three days before using. 

Red Vegetable Salad. — One pint of cold boiled potatoes, 
one pint of cold boiled beets, one pint of uncooked red cab- 
bage, six tablespoonfuls of oil, eight of red vinegar (that in 
which beets have been pickled), two teaspoonfuls of salt (un- 
less the vegetables have been cooked in salted water), half a 
teaspoonful of pepper. Cut the potatoes in thin slices and the 
beets fine, and slice the cabbage as thin as possible. Mix all 
the ingredients. Let stand in a cold place one hour; then 
serve. Red cabbage and celery may be used together. 

Celery Salad. — One boiled egg, one raw egg, one table- 
spoonful salad oil, one teaspoonful white sugar, one saltspoon- 
ful of salt, one saltspoon of pepper, four tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, one teaspoonful made mustard. Prepare the dress- 
ing as for tomato salad ; cut the celery into bits half an inch 
long, and season. Eat at once, before the vinegar injures the 
crispness of the vegetable. 

Cold Slaw. — Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Prepare 
a dressing in the proportion of one tablespoonful of oil to four 
of vinegar, a teaspoonful of made mustard, the same quantity 
of salt and sugar, and half as much pepper. Pour over the 
salad, adding, if you choose, three tablespoonfuls of minced 
celery ; toss up well and put into a glass bowl. 



— 103 



Salad Dressing (Excellent).— Four eggs, one teaspoonful 
of mixed mustard, one quarter teaspoonful of white pepper, 
half that quantity of cayenne, salt to taste, four tablespoon - 
fuls of cream, vinegar. 

Boil the eggs until hard, which will be in about one-quarter 
hour or twenty minutes ; put them into cold water, take off 
the shells, and pound the yolks in a mortar to a smooth paste. 
Then add all the other ingredients, except the vinegar, and 
stir them well until the whole are thoroughly incorporated one 
with the other. Pour in sufficient vinegar to make it of the 
consistency of cream, taking care to add but little at a time. 
The mixture will then be ready for use. 

Pickled Cucumbers.— Wash and wipe six hundred small 
cucumbers and two quarts of peppers. Put them in a tub with 
one and a half cupfuls of salt and a piece of alum as large as 
an egg. Heat to the boiling point three gallons of cider vine- 
gar and three pints of water. Add a quarter of a pound each 
of whole cloves, whole allspice and stick cinnamon, and two 
ounces of white mustard seed, and pour over the pickles. 

To Pickle Onions.— Peel the onions until they are white, 
scald them in strong salt and water, then take them up with 
a skimmer ; make vinegar enough to cover them, boiling hot, 
strew over the onions whole pepper and white mustard seed, 
pour the vinegar over to cover them ; when cold, put them m 
wide-mouthed bottles, and cork them close. A tablespoon- 
ful of sweet oil may be put in the bottles before the cork. 
The best sort of onions for pickling are the small white but- 
tons. 

Pickled Cauliflowers.— Two cauliflowers, cut up ; one pint 
of small onions, three medium-sized red peppers. Dissolve 
half a pint of salt in water enough to cover the vegetables, 
and let these stand over night. In the morning drain them. 
Heat two quarts of vinegar with four tablespoonfuls of mus- 
tard, until it boils. Add the vegetables, and boil for about 
fifteen minutes, or until a fork can be thrust through the cau- 
liflower. 

Red Cabbage.— Procure a firm, good-sized cabbage, and 
after taking off any straggling or soiled leaves, cut it in very 
narrow slices, which, after you sprinkle them well with salt, 
lay aside for forty -eight hours. Next drain off the salt liquor 



— 104 — 

which has formed, and pour over the cabbage a well-seasoned 
pickle of boiling hot vinegar ; black pepper and ginger are 
best for seasoning. Cover the pickle jars till the cabbage is 
cold, and then cork. 

To Pickle Tomatoes.^-Take the round smooth green toma- 
toes, put them in salt and water, cover the vessel and put them 
over the fire to scald, that is, to let the water become boiling 
hot ; then set the kettle off; take them from the pot into a ba- 
sin of cold water ; to enough cold vinegar to cover them, put 
whole pepper and mustard seed ; when the tomatoes are cold 
take them from the water, cut each in two across, shake out 
the seeds and wipe the inside dry with a cloth, then put them 
into glass jars, and cover with the vinegar ; cork them close 
or with a close fitting tin cover. 

Ripe Tomato Pickles. — To seven pounds of ripe tomatoes 
add three pounds sugar, one quart vinegar; boil them together 
fifteen minutes, skim out the tomatoes and boil the syrup a 
few minutes longer. Spice to suit the taste with cloves and 
cinnamon.

Piccalilii.— One peck of green tomatoes (if the flavor of 
onions is desired, take eight, but it is very nice without any); 
four green peppers ; slice all, and put in layers, sprinkle on 
one cup of salt, an.d let them remain over night ; in the morn- 



— los- 
ing press dry through a sieve, put it iu a porcelain kettle and

Pickled Walnuts (very good) — One hundred walnuts, salt 
and water. To each quart of vinegar allow two ounces of 
whole black pepper, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of bruised 
ginger. Procure the walnuts while young ; be careful they 
are not woody, and prick them well with a fork; prepare a 
strong brine of salt and water (four pounds of salt to each 
gallon of water), into which put the walnuts, letting them re- 
main nine days, and changing the brine every third day ; 
drain them off, put them on a dish, place it in the sun until 
they become perfectly black, which will be in two or three 
days ; have ready dry jars, into which place the walnuts, and 
do not quite fill the jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, 
for ten minutes, with spices in the above proportion, and pour 
it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite covered with the 
pickle; tie down with bladder, and keep in dry place. They 
will be fit for use in a month, and will keep good two or three 
years.

large onions sliced, one teacup of salt over both ; mix thor- 
oughly and let remain over night ; pour off liquor in the

cut one inch long, one quart green tomatoes sliced ; put this 
mixture in a pretty strong brine tWenty-f our hours ; drain 
three hours, then sprinkle in a quarter pound black and a 
quarter pound white mustard seed ; also one tablespoon black 
ground pepper ; let it come to a good boil in just vinegar 
enough to cover it, adding a little alum. Drain again, and 
when cold, mix in a half pint ground mustard ; cover the 
whole Avith good cider vinegar; add turmeric enough to color, 
if you like. 

Pickled Mushrooms. — Sufficient vinegar to cover the mush- 
rooms ; to each quart of mushrooms, two blades pounded mace, 
one ounce ground pepper ; salt to taste. Choose some nice 
young button-mushrooms for pickling, and rub off the skin 
with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks ; if very 
large, take out the red inside, and reject the black ones, as 
they are too old. Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle salt over 
them, with pounded mace and pepper in the above proportion ; 
shake them well over a clear fire until the liquor flows, and 
keep them there until it is all dried up again ; then add as much 
vinegar as will cover them ; just let it simmer for one minute, 
and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold, tie down 
with bladder, and keep in a dry place ; they will remain good 
for a length of time, and are generally considered delicious. 

Favorite Pickles. — One quart raw cabbage chopped fine ; 
one quart boiled beets chopped fine ; two cups sugar, table- 
spoon salt, one teaspoon black pepper, a quarter teaspoon red

— 107 — 

€gar, one quart of lemon- juice. Chop the apples in small square 
pieces, and add to them the other ingredients. Mix the whole 
well together, and put in a well covered jar. Keep this in a 
warm place, and stir everyday for a month, taking care to put 
on the lid after this operation; strain, but do not squeeze it dry ; 
store it away in clean jars or bottles for use, and the liquor 
will serve as an excellent sauce for meat or fish. 

Pickled Cherries. - Five pounds of cherries, stoned or not ; 
one quart of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half ounce of 
cinnamon, one-half ounce of cloves, one-half ounce of mace ; 
boil the sugar and vinegar and spices together (grind the 
spices and tie them in a muslin bag), and pour hot over the 
cherries. 

Pickled Plums. — To seven pounds plums, four pounds 
sugar, two ounces stick cinnamon, two ounce cloves, one 
quart vinegar, add a little mace ; put in the jar first a layer of 
plums, then a layer of spices alternately ; scald the vinegar 
and sugar together, pour it over the plums, repeat four times 
for plums (only once for cut apples and pears), the fourth time 
scald all together ; put them into glass jars and they are ready 
for use. 

Spiced Plums. — Make a syrup, allowing one pound of sugar 
to one of plums, and to every three pounds of sugar a scant 
pint of vinegar. Allow one ounce each of ground cinnamon, 
cloves, mace, and allspiece, to a peck of plums. Prick the 
plums. Add the spices to the syrup, and pour, boiling, over 
the plums. Let these stand three days ; then skim them out, 
and boil down the syrup until it is quite thick, and pour hot 
over the plums in the jar in which they are to be kept. Cover 
closely. 

Peaches, Pears, and Sweet Apples. — For six pounds of 
fruit use three of sugar, about five dozen cloves, and a pint 
of vinegar. Into each apple, pear, or peach, stick two cloves. 
Have the syrup hot, and cook until tender. 

Tomato Catsup. — Take one gallon of skinned tomatoes, 
four tablespoonfuls of salt, four ditto of whole black pepper, 
half a spoonful of allspice, eight pods of red pepper, and three 
spoonfuls of mustard ; boil them together for one hour, then 
strain it through a sieve, or coarse cloth, and when cold, bot- 
tle for use ; have the best velvet corks. 



— 108 — 

Walnut Catsup. — Bruise to a mass one hundred and twenty 
green walnuts, gathered when a pm^ could pierce one ; put ta 
it three-quarters of a pound of salt and a quart of good vine- 
gar ; stir them every day for a fortnight, then strain, and 
squeeze the liquor from them through a cloth, and set it aside ; 
put to the husks half a pint of vinegar, and let it stand all 
night : then strain and squeeze them as before ; put the liquor 
from them to that which was put aside ; add to it one ounce 
and a quarter of whole pepper, forty cloves, half an ounce of 
nutmeg, sliced, and half an ounce of ginger, and boil it for 
half an hour, closely covered, then strain it ; when cold, bot- 
tle it for use. Secure the bottles with new corks, and dip them 
in melted rosin. 

Mushroom Catsup. — To each peck of mushrooms one half 
pound of salt ; to each quart of mushroom liquor one quarter 
ounce of cayenne, one half ounce of allspice, one half ounce 
of ginger, two blades of pounded mace. Choose full-grown 
mushroom-flaps, and take care they are perfectly fresh-gath- 
ered when the weather is tolerably dry ; for, if they are picked 
during very heavy rain, the catsup from which they are made 
is liable to get musty, and will not keep long. Put a layer of 
them in a deep pan, sprinkle salt over them, and then another 
layer of mushrooms, and so on alternately. Let them remain 
for a few hours, when break them up with the hand ; put 
them in a nice cool place for three days, occasionally stirring 
and mashing them well, to extract from them as much juice 
as possible. Now measure the quantity of liquor, without 
straining, and to each quart allow the above proportion of 
spices, etc. Put all into a stone jar, cover it up very closely, 
put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it over the fire, and 
let it boil for three hours. Have ready a nice, clean stewpan, 
turn into it the contents of the jar, and let the whole simmer 
very gently half an hour ; pour it into a jug, where it should 
stand in a cool place till the next day; then pour it off into an- 
other jug, and strain it into very dry clean bottles, and do not 
squeeze the mushrooms. To each pint of catsup add a few 
drops of brandy. Be careful not to shake the contents, but 
leave all the sediment behind in the jug ; cork well, and either 
seal or rosin the cork, so as perfectly to exclude the air. 
When a very clear, bright catsup is wanted, the liquor must 
be strained through a very fine hair sieve, or flannel bag^ 



— 109 — 

after it has been very gently poured off ; if the operation is 
not successful, it must be. repeated until you have quite a clear 
liquor. It should be examined occasionally, and if it is spoil- 
ing should be reboiled with a few peppercorns. 

Brine that Preserves Butter a Year. — To three gallons of 
brine strong enough to bear an Q:g^, add one quarter pound 
good loaf sugar, and one tablespoonful of saltpetre ; boil the 
brine, and when it is cold, strain carefully. Pack butter 
closely in small jars, and allow the brine to cover the butter 
to the depth of at least four inches. This completely excludes 
the air. If practicable, make your butter into small rolls, 
wrap each carefully in a clean muslin cloth, tying up with a 
string ; place a weight over the butter, to keep it all sub- 
merged in the brine. This mode is most recommended by 
those who have tried both. 



PUDDINGS. 

General Remarks. — All boiled puddings should be put on in 
boiling water, which must not be allowed to stop simmering, 
and the pudding must always be covered with the water ; if 
requisite, the saucepan should be kept filled up. To prevent 
a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom of the 
saucepan, place a small plate or saucer underneath it ; if a 
mould is used, this precaution is not necessary ; but care must 
be taken to keep the pudding well covered with water. For 
dishing a boiled pudding, as soon as it comes out of the pot, 
dip it into a basin of cold water, and the cloth will then not 
adhere to it. Great expedition is necessary in sending pud- 
dings to table, as, by standing, they quickly become heavy, 
batter puddings particularly. For baked or boiled puddings, 
the moulds, cups, or basins should be always buttered before 
the mixture is put in them, and i\\ej should be put into the 
saucepan directly they are filled. 

Christmas Plum Pudding. — One pound butter, one pound 
suet, freed from strings and chopped fine, one pound sugar, 



— 110 — 

two and a half pounds flour, two pounds raisins, seeded, 
chopped, and dredged with flour, two pounds currants, picked 
over carefully after they are washed, one quarter pound cit- 
ron, shred fine, twelve eggs, whites and yolks beaten sepa- 
rately, one pint milk, one cup brandy, one half ounce cloves, 
one half ounce mace, two grated nutmegs. Cream the butter 
and sugar, beat in the yolks when you have whipped them 
smooth and light ; next put in the milk, then the flour, alter- 
nately with the beaten whites, then the brandy and spice, 
lastl}^ the fruit, well dredged with flour. Mix all thoroughly; 
wring out your pudding cloth in hot water, flour well inside, 
pour in the mixture, and boil five hours. 

Boiled Butter Pudding. — Three eggs, one ounce butter, one 
l)int milk, three tablespoonfuls flour, a little salt. Put the 
flour into a basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten it ; care- 
fully rub down all the lumps with a spoon, then pour in the 
remainder of the milk, and stir in the butter, which should be 
previously melted ; keep beating the mixture, add the eggs 
and a pinch of salt, and when the batter is quite smooth, put 
it into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very tightly, and put 
it into boiling water ; move the basin about for a few min^ 
utes after it is put in the water, to prevent the flour settling 
in any part, and boil for one and one quarter hour. This pud- 
ding may also be boiled in a floured cloth that has been wetted 
in hot water ; it will then take a few minutes less than when 
boiled in a basin. Send these puddings very quickly to table, 
and serve with sweet sauce, wine sauce, stewed fruit, or jam 
of any kind ; when the latter is used, a little of it may be 
X)laced round the dish in small quantities, as a garnish. 

Batter Pudding. — One quart milk, four eggs, six ounces 
flour, a little soda and salt. Mix the flour very carefully with

upon the bread-crumbs, one tablespoonful melted butter. Rub 
the butter and sugar together ; put the beaten yolks in next, 
then the soaked bread-crumbs, the lemon, juice and rind, and 
beat to a smooth, light paste before adding the whites. Butter 
your mould very well, and put in the bottom a light layer of 
dry bread-crumbs, upon this one of macaroons, laid evenly 
and closely together. Wet this with wine, and cover with a 
layer of the mixture, then with slices of sponge-cake, spread 
thickly with jelly or jam; next macaroons, wet with wine, 
more custard, sponge-cake and jam, and so on until the mould 
is full, putting a layer of the mixture at the top. Cover closely, 
and steam in the oven three-quarters of an hour ; then remove 
the cover to brown the top. Turn out carefully into a dish, 
and pour over it a sauce made of currant jelly warmed, and 
beaten up with two tablespoonfuls melted butter and a glass 
of pale sherry.

little cold milk ; stir all the time ; as soon as thickened pour 
over the fruit. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, adding a table- 
spoon of sugar, and spread over the top for frosting ; set it in 
the oven for a few minutes to harden ; eat cold or hot (better 
cold), for dinner or supper. Berries or peaches can be sub- 
stituted for oranges,

froth ; beat it, and let cook a few minutes, then pour into tea- 
cups, filling about half full, and set in cool place. For sauce, 
make a boiled custard as follows : Bring to boiling point one 
pint of milk, add three tablespoons sugar, then the beaten 
yolks thinned by adding one tablespoon milk, stirring all the 
time till it thickens ; flavor with two teaspoons lemon or two 
of vanilla, and set to cool. In serving, put one of the moulds 
in a sauce-dish for each person, and pour over it some of the 
boiled custard. Or the pudding may be made in one large 
mould. 

To make a chocolate pudding, flavor the above pudding 
with vanilla, remove two-thirds of it, and add half a cake of 
chocolate softened, mashed, and dissolved in a little milk. 
Put a layer of half the white pudding into the mold, then the 
chocolate, then the rest of the white; or two layers of chocolate 
may be used with a white between ; or the center may be 
cocoa (made by adding half a cocoanut grated fine), and the 
outside chocolate ; or pine-apple chopped fine (if first cooked 
in a little water, the latter makes a nice dressing), or straw- 
berries may be used.

corn-starch, yolks of four eggs, half cup sugar and a little 
salt ; put part of the milk, salt and sugar on the stove and let

a cup of sugar ; flavor with lemon ; spread it on the pudding, 
and put it into the oven to brown, saving a little of the frost- 
ing to moisten the top ; then put on grated cocoanut to give it 
the appearance of snow-flake.

add sifted sugar, grated lemon-rind, and si-x well-beaten eggs. 
Beat these ingredients well together ; then melt the butter, 
stir it to the other things, put a border of puff paste round the 
dish, and bake for rather more than half an hour. The butter 
should not be added until the pudding is ready for the oven. 

Snow Balls. — Pick all imperfections from a half pint of 
rice, put it in water, and rub it between the hands; then pour 
that water off, put more on, stir it about in it, let the rice set- 
tle, then drain the water off; put the rice in a two-quart stew- 
pan, with a teaspoonf ul of salt, and a quart of water; cover 
the stew-pan, and set it where it will boil gently for one hour,

ples; bake two hours in a quick oven, then turn it out. Quar- 
ter of a pound of butter, and half a pound of sugar, to half a 
peck of tart apples. 

Ground Rice Pudding. — This is an economical pudding, 
made with two pints of sweet milk, a teacupf ul of ground rice, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, and a little ground 
nutmeg. Bring half the quantity of milk to the boiling point, 
with the nutmeg or any other flavoring matter, and sugar. In 



— 116 — 

the other half of the miik beat up the rice flour into a thin 
batter, adding to it through a strainer the hot seasoned milk, 
stirring all the time. The eggs well \vhisked should next be 
added. A sprinkling of salt is an improvement. Bake this 
mixture in a ixioderate oven for a little over an hour, sa,y sev 
enty minutes, or boil in a buttered basin or shape. Serve with 
apricot preserve, or marmalade, or indeed any kind of jam.

blespoonfuls of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of butter, three pints of stale sponge cake, one cup- 
ful of raisins, chopped citron and currants. Have a little 
more of the currants than of the other two fruits. Beat the 
eggs, sugar and salt together, and add the milk. Butter a 
three-pint pudding mould (the melon shape is nice), sprinkle 
the sides and bottom with the fruit, and put in a layer of cake. 
Again sprinkle in fruit, and put in more cake. Continue this 
until all the materials are used. Gradually pour on the cus- 
tard. Let the pudding stand two hours, and steam an hour 
and a quarter. Serve with wine, or creamy sauce.

sugar ; when soft, add one cup boiling water, juice of one 
lemon, and the whites of four well-beaten eggs ; beat all to- 
gether until very light ; put in glass dish, and pour over it 
custard made as follows : One pint milk, yolks of four eggs, 
and grated rind of one lemon ; boil. Splendid. 



— 117 — 

Chocolate Pudding. — Put one pint of milk in a double boiler; 
moisten four tablespoonfuls of cornstarch ; add to the boiling 
milk, and stir until perfectly smooth ; cook about two min- 
utes ; add a half cup sugar and two ounces of grated Menier 
chocolate ; stir until perfectly smooth ; take it from the fire, 
and add liastily the well-beaten whites of four eggs and a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla ; turn into a mould and stand away to 
harden. 

Lemon Pudding. — Half pound of sugar, half pound butter, 
five eggs, half gill brandy, rind and juice of one large lemon; 
beat well the butter and sugar, whisk the eggs, add them to 
the lemon, grate the peel, line a dish with puff paste, and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Roly-Poly. — Take one quart of flour ; make good biscuit 
crust ; roll out one-half inch thick, and spread with any kind 
of fruit, fresh or preserved ; fold so that the fruit will not run 
out ; dip cloth into boiling water, and flour it, and lay around 
the pudding closely, leaving room to swell ; steam one or one 
and one-half hours ; serve with boiled sauce, or lay in steamer, 
without a cloth, and steam for one hour. 

Cottage Pudding. — One-half cup of sugar, one cup of milk, 
one pint of flour, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one 
teaspoonful soda, two of cream of tartar, two eggs, a little 
salt ; bake one-quarter of an hour in small pans. 

Cocoanut Pudding. — Beat two eggs with one cupful of new 
milk ; add one-quarter of a pound of grated cocoanut ; mix 
with it three tablespoonfuls each of grated bread and pow- 
dered sugar, two ounces of melted butter, five ounces of rais- 
ins, and one teaspoonful of grated lemon peel ; beat the whole 
well together ; pour the mixture into a buttered dish, and bake 
in a slow oven ; then turn it out, dust sugar over it, and serve. 
This pudding may be either boiled or baked. 

Cream Pudding. — Stir together one pint cream, three ounces 
sugar, the yolks of three eggs, and a little grated nutmeg; add 
the well-beaten whites, stirring lightly, and pour into a but- 
tered pie plate, on which has been sprinkled the crumbs 
of stale bread to about the thickness of an ordinary crust ; 
sprinkle over the top a layer of bread-crumbs, and bake. 

Tapioca Pudding. — Cover three tablespoons tapioca with 
water ; stand over night ; add one quart milk, a small piece of 



— 118 — 

butter, a little salt, and boil ; beat the yolks of three eggs with 
a cup of sugar, and boil the whole, to a very thick custard ; 
flavor with vanilla ; when cold cover with whites of eggs 
beaten. 

Common Custard.— Beat either four or five fresh eggs light; 
then stir them into a quart of milk ; sweeten to taste ; flavor 
with a teaspoonful of peach water, or extract of iemoxi, or 
vanilla, and half a teaspoonful of salt ; rub butter over the 
bottom and sides of a baking dish or tin basin ; pour in the 
custard, grate a little nutmeg over, and bake in a quick oven. 
Three-quarters- of an hour is generally enough. Try whether 
it is done by putting a teaspoon handle into the middle of it ; 
if it comes out clean, it is enough. 

Or, butter small cups, set them into a shallow pan of hot 
water, reaching nearly to the top of the cups ; nearly fill them 
with the custard mixture ; keep the water boiling until they 
are done. The pan may be set in an oven, or over a fire ; if 
over the fire, it is best to brown them with a hot shovel. 



F»UDOING SAUCES. 

Rich Wine Sauce. — One cupful of butter, two of powdered 
sugar, half a cupful of wine. Beat the butter to a cream. 
Add the sugar gradually, and when very light, add the wine, 
which has been made hot, a little at a time. Place the bowl 
in a basin of hot water, and stir for two minutes. The sauce 
should be smooth and foamy. 

Whipped Cream Sauce. — Whip a pint of thick sweet cream, 
add the beaten whites of two eggs, sweeten to taste ; place 
pudding in centre of dish, and surround with the sauce ; or 
pile up in centre, and surround with moulded blanc-mange, or 
fruit puddings. 

Lemon Sauce. — One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, one 
egg, one lemon, juice and grated rind, three tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water ; put in a tin pail, and thicken over steam. 



— 110 — 

Jelly Sauce. — Melt one ounce of sugar and two tablespoons 
grape jelly over the fire in a half pint of boiling water, and 
stir into it half a teaspoon corn starch, dissolved in a half cup 
cold water ; let come to a boil, and it will be ready for use. 
Any other fruit jelly may be used instead of grape. 

Cabinet Pudding Sauce. — Take the >olks of five eggs, and 
whip; them lightly ; express the juice of a lemon, and grate 
down a little of the peel. The other ingredients are a table- 
spoonful of butter, a cup of sugar, a glass of good wine, and 
a little spice. Mix the sugar and butter, adding the yolks, 
spice, and lemon juice. Beat fifteen minutes, then add the 
wine, and stir hard. Immerse in a saucepan of boiling water, 
beating while it heats. 

Foaming Sauce. — Beat whites of three eggs to a stiff froth; 
melt teacup of sugar in a little water, let it boil, stir in one 
glass of wine, and then the w^iites of the three eggs ; serve 
at once. 

Spanish Sauce. — One-half cup of boiling water, one table- 
spoon corn starch, two tablespoonf uls vinegar, one tablespoon- 
ful butter, one cup sugar, one-half nutmeg. 

Hard Sauce. — Beat to a cream a quarter of a pound of but- 
ter, add gradually a quarter of a pound of sugar ; beat it un- 
til very white ; add a little lemon juice, or grate nutmeg on 
top. 

Pudding Sauce. — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, 
yolks of three eggs : one teaspoon corn starch or arrow root ; 
stir the whole until very light ; add sufficient boiling water 
to make the consistency of thick cream ; wine or brandy, to 
suit the taste. 

Sauce for Plum Pudding.— The yolks of three eggs, one 
tablespoonf Lil of powdered sugar, one gill of milk, a very little 
jiTated lemon-rind, two small wineglassfuls of brandy. Sepa- 
rate the yolks from the whites of three eggs, and put the 
former into a stew-pan ; add the sugar, milk, and grated lemon- 
rind, and stir over the fire until the mixture thickens ; but do 
not allow it to boil. Put in the brandy ; let the sauce stand 
by the side of the fire, to get quite hot ; keep stirring it, and 
serve in a boat or tureen separately, or pour it over the pud- 
ding. 



120 — 



Vanilla Sauce. — The whites of two eggs and the yolk of 
one, half a cupful of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of va- 
nilla, three tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth, next beat in the sugar, and then the yolk 
of the egg and the seasoning. Serve immediately. This sauce 
is for light puddings. 



PASTRY. 



Very Good Puff-Paste. — To every pound of flour allow one 
pound of butter, and not quite one-half pint of water. Care- 
fully weigh the flour and butter, and have the exact propor- 
tion ; squeeze the butter well, to extract the water from it, 
and afterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture 
may remain. Sift the flour ; see that it is perfectly dry, and 
proceed in the following manner to make the paste, using a 
very clean paste-board and rolling-pin. Supposing the quan- 
tity to be one pound of flour, work the whole into a smooth 
paste, with not quite one-half pint of water, using a knife to 
mix it with ; the proportion of this latter ingredient must be 
regulated by the discretion of the cook ; if too much be added, 
the paste, when baked, will be tough. Roll it out until it is of 
an equal thickness of about an inch ; break four ounces of the 
butter into small pieces ; place these on the paste, sift over it 
a little flour, fold it over, roll out again, and put another four 
ounces of butter. Repeat the rolling and buttering until the 
paste has been rolled out four times, or equal quantities of 
flour and butter have been used. Do not omit, every time the 
paste is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over that and the 
rolling-pin, to prevent both from sticking. Handle the paste 
as lightly as possible, and do not press heavily upon it with 
the rolling-pin. The next thing to be considered is the oven, 
as the baking of pastry requires particular attention. Do not 
put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the 
paste ; for the best-prepared paste, if not properly baked, will 
be good for nothing. Brushing the paste as often as rolled 
out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the white of 



— 1-a — 

an egg", assists it to rise in leaves or flakes. As tliis is the great 
beauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try this metliod. 

Plainer Paste. — One pound of flour, a little more for rolling- 
pin and board, and half a pound of butter and half a pound of 
lard. Cut the butter and lard through the flour (which should 
be sifted), and mix with sufficient ice water to roll easily. 
Avoid kneading it, and use the hands as little as possible in 
mixing. 

Suet Crust, for Pies or Puddings. — To every pound of flour 
allow five or six ounces of beef suet, one-half pint of water. 
Free the suet from skin and shreds ; chop it extremely fine, 
and rub it well into the flour ; work the whole to a smooth 
paste with the above proportion of waterj roll it out, and it is 
ready for use. This crust is quite rich enough for ordinary 
purposes ; but when a better one is desired, use from one-half 
to three-quarters pound of suet to every pound of flour. Some 
cooks, for rich crusts, pound the suet in a mortar, with a small 
quantity of butter. It should then be laid on the paste in small 
pieces, the same as for puff- crust, and will be found exceed- 
ingly nice for hot tarts. Five ounces of suet to every pound 
of flour will make a very good crust ; and even one-quarter 
pound will answer very well for children, or where the crust 
is wanted very plain. 

To Ice Pastry. — To ice pastry, which is the usual method 
adopted for fruit tarts and sweet dishes of pastry, put the white 
of an egg on a plate, and with the blade of a knife beat it to a 
stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over 
with this, and sift over some powdered sugar ; put it back into 
the oven to set the glaze, and in a few minutes it will be done. 
Great care should be taken that the paste does not catch or 
burn in the oven, which it is very liable to do after the icing 
is laid on. 

To Glaze Pastry. — To glaze pastry, which is the usual 
method adopted for meat or raised pies, break an egg, sepa- 
rate the yolk from the white, and beat the former for a short 
time. Then, when the pastry is nearly baked, take it out of 
the oven, brush it over with this beaten yolk of egg, and put 
it back in the oven to set the glaze. 

Mince-Meat. — Take five or six pounds scraggy beef — a neck 
piece Avill do — and put to boil in water enough to cover it, take 



I T is not the luuction pt the chemist to prescribe a preparation for a debilitated condition 
' so that the system can be invigorated and built up. The chemist has to present the com- 
position and chemical properties to the physician, who is competent to dictate the advantage 
to be derived Ircm its use. 

The chemist, however, has the right to point out the superior qualities of one preparation 
over another !-o far as relates to its composition, and I do not hesitate to say that ALE AND 
BEEF, " PEPTONIZED," containing, as it does, meat in a soluble and digested condition, 
ISA FOOD PRODUCT OF THE FIRST ORDER, and will certainly meet with an enormous 
sale when it becomes generally known, as physicians will not hesitate to adopt and recommend 
the same. 

I am pleased to learn that already nearly twenty-five thousand physicians throughout the 
United States are constantly recommending and prescribing ALE AND BEEF, " PEPTON= 
IZED," to their patients, and are satisfied of its intrinsic merits. 

I give to ALE AND BEEF, "PEPTONIZED," my unqualified endorsement, as I am clearly 
of the opinion that it is a most valuable preparation and will prove of great assistance to the 
medical profession and to humanity at large.

I have analyzed the sample of " Ale and Beef" supplied by The Ale and Beef Company, 
and find it to be an exceedingly wholesome and pure dietetic preparation. 

It is a high nutrient tonic of excellent flavor, and I can, without reservation, recommend it 
as a safe and agreeable stimulant which may be freely given in many cases where "beer and 
stout " are altogether out of the question 

It will quench thirst and appease hunger, and as a general "pick-me-up," holds a promi- 
nent and unquestionable position.

off the scum that rises when it reaches the boiling point, add 
hot water from time to time until At is tender, then remove 
the lid from the pot, salt, let boil till almost dry, turning the 
meat over occasionally in the liquor, take from the fire, and 
let stand over night to get thoroughly cold ; pick bones, 
gristle, or stringy bits from the meat, chop very fine, mincing 
at the same time three pounds of nice beef suet ; seed and cut 
four pounds raisins, wash and dry four pounds currants, 
slice thin a pound of citron, chop fine four quarts good cook- 
ing tart apples ; put into a large pan together, add two ounces 
cinnamon, one of cloves, one of ginger, four nutmegs, the juice 
and grated rinds of two lemons, one tablespoon salt, one tea- 
spoon pepper, and two pounds sugar. Put in a porcelain kettle 
one quart boiled cider, or, better still, one quart currant or 
grape juice (canned when grapes are turning from green to 
purple), one quart nice molasses or syrup, also a good lump of 
butter; let it come to boiling point, and pour over the ingredi- 
ents in the pan after having first mixed them well, then mix 
again thoroughly. Pack in jars and put in a cool place, and, 
Avhen cold, pour molasses over the top an eighth of an inch in 
thickness, and cover tightly. This will keep two months. 
For baking, take some out of a jar ; if not moist enough add a 
little hot water, and strew a few whole raisins over each pie. 
Instead of boiled beef, a beefs heart or roast meat may be 
used ; and a good proportion for a few pies is one-third 
chopped meat and two-thirds apples, with a little suet, 
raisins, spices, butter, and salt. 

Apple Custard Pie — Peel sour apples and stew until soft 
and not much water is left in them, and rub through a colan- 
der. Beat three eggs for each pie. Put in proportion of one cup 
butter and one of sugar for three pies. Season with nutmeg. 

Apple Meringue Pie.— Pare, slice, stew and sweeten ripe, 
tart and juicy apples, mash and season with nutmeg (or stew 
lemon peel with them for flavor), fill crust and bake till done; 
spread over the apple a thick meringue made by whipping to 
froth whites of three eggs for each pie, sweetening with three 
tablespoons powdered sugar; flavor with vanilla, beat until it 
will stand alone, and cover pie three-quarters of an inch thick. 
Set back in a quick oven till well "set," and eat cold. In their 
season substitute peaches for apples. 



— 123 — 

Apple Pie. — Stew green or ripe apples, when you have 
pared and cored them. Mash to a smooth compote, sweeten 
to taste, and, while hot, stir in a teaspoonful butter for each 
pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your crust, and 
either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or bake without 
cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar strewed over it. 

Lemon Pie. — The juice and rind of one lemon, two eggs, 
eigiit heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, one small teacupful of 
milk, one teaspoonful of corn starch. Mix the corn starch 
with a little of the milk. Put the remainder on the fire, and 
when boiling, stir in the corn starch. Boil one minute. Let 
this cool, and add the yolks of the eggs, four heaping table- 
spoonfuls of the sugar, and the grated rind and juice of the 
lemon, all well beaten together. Have a deep pie plate lined 
with paste, and fill with this mixture. Bake slowly half an 
hour. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and gradu- 
ally beat into them the remainder of the sugar. Cover the pie 
with this, and brown slowly. 

Custard Pie.— Make a custard of the yolks of three eggs 
with milk, season to the taste; bake it in ordinary crust; put 
it in a brick oven, that the crust may not be heavy, and as 
soon as that is heated remove it to a place in the oven of a 
more moderate heat, that the custard may bake slowly and 
not curdle ; when done, beat the whites to a froth; add sugar 
and spread over the top, and return to the oven to brovv^n 
slightly; small pinch of salt added to a custard heightens the 
flavor ; a little soda in the crust prevents it from being heavy. 
Very nice. 

Cocoanut Pie. — One-half pound of grated cocoanut, three- 
quarters pound of white sugar (powdered), six ounces of but- 
ter, five eggs, the whites only, one glass of white wine, two 
tablespoonfuls rose-water, one tablespoonful of nutmeg. 
Cream the butter and sugar, and when well mixed, beat very 
light, with the wine and rose-water. Add the cocoanut with 
as little and as light beating as possible ; finally, whip in the 
stiffened whites of the eggs with a few skilful strokes, and 
bake at once in open shells. Eat cold, with powdered sugar 
sifted over them. 

Lemon Tarts. — Mix well together the juice and grated rind 
of two lemons, two cups of sugar, two eggs, and the crumbs 



— 1^4 — 

of sponge cake; beat it all together until smooth; put into 
twelve patty -pans lined with puff -paste, and bake until the 
crust is done. 

Pastry Sandwiches. — Puff-paste, jam of any kind, the white 
of an egg, sifted sugar. 

Roll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking sheet or 
tin, and spread equally over it apricot, greengage, or any pre- 
serve that may be preferred. Lay over this preserve another 
thin paste, press the edges together all round, and mark the 
paste in lines with a knife on the surface, to show where to 
cut it when baked. Bake from twenty minutes to half an 
hour; and, a short time before being done, take the pastry out 
of the oven, brush it over with the white of an egg, sift over 
pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to color. When 
cold, cut it into strips; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and 
serve. These strips, cut about two inches long, piled in cir- 
cular rows, and a plateful of flavored whipped cream poured 
in the middle, make a very pretty dish. 

Cherry Pie. — Line the dish with a good crust, and fill with 
ripe cherries, regulating the quantity of sugar you scatter over 
them by their sweetness. Cover and bake. 

Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over the top. 

Squash Pie. — Two teacups of boiled squash, three-fourths 
teacup of brown sugar, three eggs, two tablespoons of molas- 
;xs, one tablespoon of melted butter, one tablespoon of ginger, 
one teaspoon of cinnamon, two teacups of milk, a little salt. 
Make two plate pies. 

Cream Pie. — Pour a pint of creain upon a cup and a half 
powdered sugar; let stand until the whites of three eggs liave 
been beaten to a stiff froth; add this to the cream, and beat 
up thoroughly; grate a little nutmeg over the mixture, and 
bake in two pies without upper crusts. 

Tartlets.— Puff -paste, the white of an egg, pounded sugar. 

Mode: — Roll some good puff -paste out thin, and cut it into 
two and a half inch squares; brush each square over with the 
white of an egg, then fold down the corners, so that they all 
meet in the middle of each piece of paste; slightly press the 
two pieces together, brush them over with the egg, sift over 
sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about a quarter of 
an hour. When they are done, make a little hole in the mid- 



— 125 — 

die of the paste, and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, 
•or red currant jelly. Pile them high in the centre of a dish, 
on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve the tartlets 
are filled with. 

Peach Pie. — Line a pie-tin with puff -paste, fill with pared 
peaches in halves or quarters, well covered with sugar ; put 
on upper crust and bake; or make as above without upper 
crust, bake until done, remove from the oven, and cover with 
a meringue made of the whites of two eggs, beaten to a stiff 
froth with two tablespoons powdered sugar ; return to ov^en 
and brown slightly. Canned peaches may be used instead of 
fresh, in the same way. 

Tart Shells. — Roll out thin a nice putt'-paste, cut out with a 
glass or biscuit cutter, with a wine-glass or smaller cup cut 
out the centre of two out of three of these, lay the rings thus 
made on the third, and bake immediately ; or shells may be 
made by lining patty-pans with paste. If the paste is light, 
the shells will be fine, and may be used for tarts or oyster pat- 
ties. Filled with jelly and covered with meringue (tablespoon 
sugar to white of one egg), and browned in oven, they are 
very nice to serve for tea. 

Pumpkin Pie. — One quart of stewed pumpkin, pressed 
through a sieve ; nine eggs, whites and yolks beaten sepa- 
rately ; two scant quarts of milk, one teaspoonful of mace, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and the same of nutmeg ; one 
and a half cup of white sugar, or very light brown. Beat all 
together, and bake in crust without cover. 

Mince Pies.— Three pounds of raisins, stone and. chop themi 
a little ; three pounds of currants, three pounds of sugar, three 
pounds of suet chopped very fine, two ounces of candied 
lemon-peel, two ounces of candied orange-peel, six large ap- 
ples grated, one ounce of cinnamon, two nutmegs, the juice 
of three lemons and the rinds grated, and half a pint of 
brandy. Excellent. 



CAKES. 

White Lady-Cake. — Beat the whites of eight eggs to a high 
froth, add gradually a pound of white sugar finely ground, 
beat quarter of a pound of butter to a cream, add a teacup of 
sweet milk with a small teaspoonful of powdered volatile salts 
or saleratus dissolved in it; put the eggs to butter and milk, 
add as much sifted wheat flour as will make it as thick as 
pound-cake mixture, and a teaspoonful of orange-flower water 
or lemon extract, then add quarter of a pound of shelled al- 
monds, blanched and beaten to a paste with a little white of 
egg ; beat the whole together until light and white ; line a 
square tin pan with buttered paper, put in the mixture an inch 
deep, and bake half an hour in a quick oven. When done 
take it from the pan, when cold take the paper off, turn it 
upside down on the bottom of the pan, and ice the side which 
was down ; when the icing is nearly hard mark it in slices the 
width of a fingei, and two inches and a half long. 

Macaroons. — One-half pound of sweet almonds, one-half 
pound of sifted loaf sugar, the whites of three eggs, wafer- 
paper. Blanch, skin and dry the almonds, and pound them 
well with a little orange-flower water or plain water ; then add 
to them the sifted sugar and the whites of the eggs, whicli 
should be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix all the ingredients 
well together. When the paste looks soft, drop it at equal 
distances from a biscuit-syringe on to sheets of wafer-paper ; 
put a strip of almond on the top of each ; strew some sugar 
over, and bake the macaroons in rather a slow oven, of alight 
brown color. When hard and set they are done, and must not 
be allowed to get very brown, as that would spoil their ap- 
pearance. If the cakes, when baked, appear heavy, add a lit 
tie more white of egg. but let this always be well Avhisked be- 
fore it is added to the other ingredients. We have given a 
recipe for making these cakes, but we think it almost or 
quite as economical to purchase such articles as these at a 
good confectioner's. 



— 127 — 

Almond Icing. — Whites of four eggs ; one pound sweet al- 
monds ; one pound powdered sugar ; a little rose-water. 
Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over them and 
stripping off the skins. When dry pound them to a paste, a 
few at a time, in a Wedgewood mortar, moistening it with 
rose-water as you go on. When beaten fine and smooth, beat 
gradually into icing. Put on very thick, and, when nearly 
dry, cover with plain icing. 

To Make Icing for Cakes. — Beat the whites of two small 
eggs to a high froth ; then add to them quarter of a pound of 
white sugar, ground fine, like flour ; flavor with lemon ex- 
tract, or vanilla ; beat it until it is light, and very white, 
but not quite so stiff as kiss mixture ; the longer it is beaten, 
the more firm it will become. No more sugar must be added 
to make it so. Beat the frosting until it may be spread 
smoothly on the cake. This quantity will ice quite a large 
cake, over the top and sides. 

Loaf Cake. — One pound of butter beaten to a cream, two 
pounds of sugar rolled fine, three pounds of sifted wheat flour, 
six well beaten eggs, three teaspoonfuls of powdered salera- 
tus dissolved in a little hot water, one tablespoonful of 
ground cinnamon, and half a nutmeg, grated ; add one pound 
of currants, well washed and dried, one pound of raisins, 
stoned and cut in two ; work the whole well together, divide 
it in three loaves, put them in buttered basins, and bake one 
hour in a moderate oven. 

Rich Bride-Cake. — Take four pounds of sifted flour, four 
pounds of sweet fresh butter, beaten to a cream, and two 
pounds of white powdered sugar ; take six eggs for each 
pound of flour, an ounce of ground mace or nutmegs, and a 
tablespoonful of lemon extract, or orange-flower water. 

Lady Fingers. — Take eight eggs ; whip the whites to a firm 
snow. In the meantime, have the yolks beaten up with six 
ounces of powdered sugar. Each of these operations should 
be performed at least one hour. Then mix all together with 
six ounces of sifted flour, and when well incorporated, stir in 
half a pint of rose or orange-flower water ; stir them together 
for some time. 

Have ready some tin plates, rubbed with white wax ; take 
a funnel with three or four tubes ; fill it with the paste, and 



— 128 — 

press out the cakes upon the plates, to the size and length of 
a finger ; grate white sugar over each ; let them lay until the 
sugar melts, and they shine ; then put them in a moderate 
oven until they have a fine color ; when cool, take them from 
the tins, and lay them together in couples, by the backs. 
These cakes may be formed with a spoon, on sheets of writing 
paper. Half this quantity will be trouble enough at one time. 
Queen Cake. — Beat one pound of butter to a cream, with 
a tablespoonful of rose-water ; then add one pound of fine 
white sugar, ten eggs, beaten very light, and a pound and a 
quarter of sifted flour ; beat the cake well together ; then add 
half a pound of shelled almonds, blanched, and beaten to a 
paste ; butter round tin basins, line them with white paper; 
put in the mixture an inch and a half deep ; bake one hour in 
a quick oven. 

Chocolate Macaroons. — Put three ounces of plain choco- 
late in a pan, and melt on a slow fire ; then work it to a thick 
paste with one pound of powdered sugar and the whites of 
three eggs ; roll the mixture down to the thickness of about 
one-quarter of an inch ; cut it in small, round pieces with a 
paste-cutter, either plain or scalloped ; butter a pan slightly, 
and dust it with flour and sugar, in equal quantities ; place in 
it the pieces of paste, or mixture, and bake in a hot but not 
quick oven. 

Caramel Cake. — One cup butter, two of sugar, a scant cup 
milk, one and a half cups flour, cup corn starch, whites of seven 
eggs, three teaspoons baking powder in the flour ; bake in a 
long pan. Take half a pound brown sugar, scant quarter pound 
chocolate, half cup milk, butter size of an egg, two teaspoons 
vanilla; mix thoroughly, and cook, as syrup, until stiff enough 
to spread ; spread on cake, and set in the oven to dry. 

Pound Cake. — One pound of butter, one and one-quarter 
pound of flour, one pound of powdered loaf sugar, one pound 
of currants, nine eggs, two ounces of candied peel, one-half 
ounce of citron, one-half ounce of sweet almonds ; when 
liked, a little pounded mace. Work the butter to a cream ; 
dredge in the flour ; add the sugar, currants, candied peel, 
which should be cut into neat slices, and the almonds, which 
should be blanched and chopped, and mix all these well to- 
gether ; whisk the eggs, and let them be tlioroughly blended 



— lv^9 — 

with the dry ingredients. Beat the cake well for twenty min- 
utes, and put it into a round tin, lined at the bottom and sides 
with a strip of white buttered paper. Bake it from one and 
one-half to two hours, and let the oven be well heated when 
the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants 
will all sink to the bottom of it. To make this preparation 
light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten sepa- 
rately, and added separately to the other ingredients. A 
^lass of wine is sometimes added to the mixture ; but this is 
scarcely necessary, as the cake will be found quite rich 
enough without it. 

Cocoanut Sponge Cake. — Beat the yolks of six eggs with 
half a pound of sugar and a quarter of a pound of flour ; add 
a teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of lemon essence, and 
half a nutmeg, grated ; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, 
and stir them to the yolks, etc., and the white meat of a co- 
coanut, grated ; line square tin pans with buttered paper, and 
having stirred the ingredients well together, put the mixture 
in an inch deep in the pans ; bake in a quick oven half an 
hour ; cut it in squares, to serve with or without icing. 

Cocoanut Pound Cake. — Beat half a pound of butter to a 
cream ; add gradually a pound of sifted flour, one pound of 
powdered sugar, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a pinch 
of salt, a teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, quarter of a pound 
of prepared cocoanut, four well-beaten eggs, and a cupful of 
milk ; mix thoroughly ; butter the tins, and line them with 
buttered paper ; pour the mixture in to the depth of an inch 
and a half, and bake in a good oven. When baked, take out, 
spread icing over them, and return the cake to the oven a mo- 
ment to dry the icing. 

Cocoanut Cup Cake. — Two cups of sugar, two cups of but- 
ter, one cup of milk, one teaspoonful of essence of lemon, half 
a nutmeg, grated, four well-beaten eggs, and the white meat 
of a cocoanut, grated ; use as much sifted wheat flour as will 
make a rather stiff batter ; beat it well, butter square tin pans, 
line thom with white paper, and put in the mixture an inch 
deep ; bake in a moderate oven half an hour, or it may re- 
quire ten minutes longer. When cold, cut in small squares 
or diamonds ; this is a rich cake, and is much improved by a 
thin icing. This cake should be made with fine white sugar. 



— 130 — 

Cocoanut Drops. — Break a cocoanut in pieces, and lay it in 
cold water ; then cut off the dark- rind, and grate the white 
meat on a coarse grater ; put the whites of four eggs with half 
a pound of powdered white sugar ; beat it until it is light and 
white, then add to it a teaspoonful of lemon extract, and grad- 
ually as much grated cocoanut as will make it as thick as can 
be stirred easily with a spoon ; lay it in heaps, the size of a 
large nutmeg, on sheets of white paper, place them the dis- 
tance of half an inch apart ; when the paper is full, lay it on 
a baking tin, set them in a quick oven ; when they begin to 
look yellowish, they are done ; let them remain on the paper 
until nearly cold, then take them off with a thin-bladed 
knife. 

Citron Heart Cakes. — Beat half a pound of butter to a 
cream, take six eggs, beat the whites to a froth, and the yolks 
with half a pound of sugar, and rather more than half a 
pound of sifted flour, beat these well together, add a wine- 
glass of brandy, and quarter of a pound of citron cut 
in thin slips, bake it in small heart shaped-tins, or a square 
tin pan, rubbed over with a bit of sponge dipped in melted 
butter, put the mixture in half an inch deep, bake fifteen or 
twenty minutes in a quick oven. These are very fine cakes. 
Shredded almonds may be used instead of citron. 

Imperial Cake. — One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar, four eggs, half a pound of 
currants, well washed and dredged, half a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot w^ater, half a lemon, grated rind and juice, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon. Drop from a spoon upon well- 
buttered paper, lining a baking pan. Bake quickly. 

Plum Cake. — Make a cake of two cups of butter, two cups 
of molasses, one cup of sweet milk, two eggs, well-beaten, one 
teaspoonful of powdered saleratus, dissolved with a little hot 
water, one teaspoonful of ground mace or nutmeg, one tea- 
spoonful of ground allspice, a tablespoonful of cinnamon, and 
gill of brandy ; stir in flour to make a batter as stiff as may be 
stirred easily with a spoon ; beat it well until it is light, then 
add two pounds of raisins, stoned, and cut in two, two pounds 
of currants, picked, washed, and dried, and half a pound of cit- 
ron, cut in slips. Bake in a quick oven. This is a fine, rich 
cake, easily made, and not expensive.

in flour, the weight of eight in pounded loaf sugar ; flavoring 
to taste. Let the flour be perfectly dry, and the sugar well 
pounded and sifted. Separate the whites from the yolks of 
the eggs, and beat the latter up with the sugar ; then whisk 
the whites until they become rather stiff, and mix them with 
the yolks, but do not stir them more than is just necessary to 
mingle the ingredients well together. Dredge in the flour by 
degr'ees, add the flavoring ; butter the tins well, pour in the 
batter, sift a little sugar over the cakes, and bake them in 
rather a quick oven, but do not allow them to take too much 
color, as they should be rather pale. Remove them from the 
tins before they get cold, and turn them on their faces, where 
let them remain until quite cold, when store them away in a 
closed tin canister, or wide-mouthed glass bottle. 

Lemon Cheese Cake.— Two cups sugar, half cup of butter, 
three-quarters cup sweet milk, whites of six eggs, three cups

pound of fine white sugar, and one pound of sifted wheat 
flour ; flavor with a teaspoonful of salt, and essence of lemon 
or orange-flower water ; beat it until it rises in bubbles ; bake 
in a quick oven. 

Cake Trifle. — Bake a Naples biscuit ; cut out the inside 
about one inch from the edge and bottom, leaving the shell. 
In place of the inside, put a custard made of the y<.]ks of four 
eggs, beaten with a pint of boiling milk, sweetened, and fla- 
vored with half a teaspoonful of peach water ; lay on it some 
jelly, or jam ; beat the whites of two eggs, v^ith white 
ground sugar, until it will stand in a heap ; put it on the jelly, 
and serve.

sugar, the weight of seven in flour, a little grated lemon-rind, 
or essence of almonds, or orange-flower water. Break the 
seven eggs, putting the yolks into one basin and the whites 
into another. Whisk the former, and mix with them the sugar, 
the grated lemon-rind, or any other flavoring to taste ; beat 
them well together, and add the whites of the eggs, whisked 
to a f rotli. Put in the flour by degrees, continuing to beat the 
mixture for one quarter of an hour, butter a mould, pour in the 
cake, and bake it from one and a quarter to one and a half 
hours. This is a very nice cake for dessert, and may be iced 



— 133 — 



for a supper table, or cut into slices and spread with jam, 
which converts it into sandwiches.

three of sugar, one of milk, five eggs, one teaspoon of soda ; 
two of cream of tartar, fruit as you please, cinnamon, nutmeg 
and clove to taste.

tablespoon pulverized sugar, teaspoon corn-starch ; dissolve 
starch smootlily with a little milk, beat yolks and sugar to- 
gether with this, boil the cream, and stir these ingredients in 
as for any cream-cake filling, only make a little thicker ; 
blanch and chop fine a half pound almonds and stir into the 
cream. Put together like jelly cake while icing is soft, and 
stick in a half pound of almonds, split in two. 

Ice-Cream Cake.— Make good sponge-cake, bake half an 
inch thick in jelly-pans, and let them get perfectly cold ; take 
a pint thickest sweet cream, beat until it looks like ice-cream, 
make very sweet, and flavor with vanilla ; blanch and chop 
a pound almonds, stir into cream, and put very thick between 
each layer. This is the queen of all cakes. 

Economical Cake.— One pound of flour, one-quarter pound 
of sugar, one-quarter pound of butter or lard, one-half pound 
of currants, one teaspoonf ul of carbonate of soda, the whites 
of four eggs, one-half pint of milk. In making many sweet 
dishes, the whites of eggs are not required, and if well beaten 
and added to the above ingredients, make an excellent cake, 
with or without currants. Beat the butter to a cream, well 
whisk the whites of the eggs, and stir all the ingredients to- 
gether but the soda, which must not be added until all is well 
mixed, and the cake is ready to be put into the oven. When 
the mixture has been well beaten, stir in the soda, put the cake 
into a buttered mould, and bake it in a moderate oven for one 
and a half hours.

to keep lard from burning, and drop in your cakes ; they will 
come to the top of lard when light ; fry a dark brown ; when 
taken out sprinkle sugar over them. 

Jelly Kisses. — Kisses, to be served for dessert at a large 
dinner, with other suitable confectionery, may be varied in this 
way : Having made the kisses, put them in a moderate oven, 
until the outside is a little hardened ; then take one off care- 
fully, as before directed ; take out the soft inside with the 
handle of a spoon, and put it back with the mixture, to make 
more ; then lay the shell down. Take another, and prepare it 
likewise ; fill the shells with currant jelly, or jam ; join two 
together, cementing them with some of the mixture; so con- 
tinue until you have enough. Make kisses, cocoanut drops, 
and such like, the day before they are wanted. 

Cocoanut Kisses. — Make a kiss mixture ; add to it half of

— 135 — 

warm, the gold between the white ones, and cover with frost- 
ing.

ing, one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, allspice and cloves, 
one teaspoonful soda; put in pans a spoonful of white part and 
then a spoonful of dark, and so on. Bake an hour and a 
quarter. Use coffe-cups to measure. This will make one 
large and one medium cake. The white and dark parts are 
alternated, either putting in a spoonful of white, then of dark, 
or a layer of white and then of dark part, being careful that 
the cake may be nicely "marbleized." 

White Pound Cake. — One pound sugar, one of flour, half 
pound butter, whites of sixteen eggs, teaspoonful baking-pow- 
der sifted thoroughly with the flour; put in cool oven with 
gradual increase of heat. For boiled icing for the cake, take

one-fourth of rice flour, six eg^s, the juice and rind of a lemon. 
Beat the butter to a cream; then gradually beat in the sugar,

saleratus; mix rather stiff; bake in loaf tins in moderate 
oven. 

Sweet Strawberry Shortcake.— Three eggs, one cupful su- 
gar, two of flour, one tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful, 
heaped, of baking-powder. Beat the butter and sugar to- 
gether, and add the eggs well beaten. Stir in the flour and 
baking-powder well sifted together. Bake in deep tin plates. 
This quantity will fill four plates. Wi h three pints of straw- 
berries mix a cupful of sugar. Spread the fruit between the 
layers of cake. The top layer of strawberries may be covered 
with a meringue made with the white of an egg and a table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar.

— 138 — 



sifted. Return it to the sieve, and mix the soda and cream of 
tartar with it. Sift tliis into the '' bowl of beaten ingredi- 
ents. Beat quickly and vigorously, to thoroughly mix, and 
then stop. Take three sheet pans of the same size, and in 
each of two put one-third of the mixture, and bake. To the 
other third add four teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, a cupful of 
currants and about an eighth of a pound of citron, cut fine. 
Bake this in the remaining pan. AVhen done, take out of the 
pans. Spread the light cake with a thin layer of jelly, while 
warm. Place on this the dark cake, and spread with jelly. 
Place the other sheet of light cake on this. Lay a paper over 
all, and then a thin sheet, on which put two irons. The cake 
will press in about two hours. 

Jelly Roll. — Make the sponge-cake mixture as for lady-fin- 
gers, and bake in one shallow pan twenty minutes. While it 
is yet warm cut off the edges, and spread tlie cake with any 
kind of jelly. Roll up, and pin a tov/el around it. Put in a 
cool place until serving time. Cut in slices with a sliarp 
knife. 

Delicate Crullers.— Four eggs, four tablespoonfuls of lard, 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a 
nutmeg, grated ; a teaspoonful of lemon extract may be added; 
work into these as much sifted flour as will make a nice dough, 
roll it to about an eighth of an inch thickness, and fry, as di- 
rected, for doughnuts and crullers. 

To make little baskets, cut the paste in strips an inch and a 
half wide and three inches long, and with a gigling iron, cut 
slits across it from one side to the other, within a quarter of an 
inch of either edge, and quarter of an inch apart ; then join the 
two ends together in a circle, forming the basket; press it down 
slightly, that the strips may bulge, and so form the basket, like 
those made for fly traps, of paper ; as soon as they are taken 
from the fat (flve minutes will do them), grate white sugar 
over. 



DBSSERT AND TEA DISHKS. 

Boiled Custard. — One quart milk, eight eggs, one-half 
pound sugar ; beat to a good froth the eggs and sugar. Put 
the milk in a tin pail, and set it in boiling water ; pour in the 
eggs and sugar, and stir until it thickens. 

Lemon Custard. — Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are 
white, add pint boiling water, the rinds of two lemons, grated, 
and the juice sweetened to taste ; stir this on the fire till it 
thickens, then add a large glass of rich wine, and one-half 
glass brandy; give the whole a good boil, and put in glasses. 
To be eaten cold. Or, put the thin yellow rind of two lemons, 
with the juice of three, and sugar to taste, into one pint of 
warm water. As lemons vary in size and juiciness, the ex- 
act quantity of sugar cannot be given. Ordinary lemons re- 
quire three gills. It will be safe to begin with that quantity,' 
more may be added if required. Beat the whites to a stiff 
froth, then the yolks ; then beat both together, pour in gradu- 
ally, while beating, the other ingredients ; put all in a pail, 
set in a pot of boiling water, and stir until thick, as boiled 
custard ; strain it in a deep dish ; when cool, place on ice. 
Serve in glasses. 

Snow Custard. — Half a package of Cox's gelatine, three 
eggs, two cups of sugar, juice of one lemon ; soak the gela- 
tine one hour in a teacup of cold water, add one pint boiling 
water, stir until thoroughly dissolved ; add two-thirds of the 
sugar and the lemon juice ; beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth, and when the gelatine is quite cold, whip it into 
the whites, a spoonful at a time, from half an hour to an hour. 
AVhip steadily and evenly, and when all is stiff, pour in a 
mould, or in a dozen egg-glasses, previously wet with cold 
water, and set in a cold place. In four or five hours turn into 
a glass dish. Make a custard of one and a half pints milk, 
yolks of eggs, and remainder of the sugar, flavor with va- 
nilla, and when the meringue, or snow-balls, are turned out 
of the mould, pour this around the base. 



— uo — 

Tapioca Pudding. — Three ounces o/ tapioca, one quart of 
milk, two ounces of butter, quarter of a pound of sugar, four 
eggs, flavoring of vanilla or bitter almonds. Wash the tapioca, 
and let it stew gently in the milk by the side of the stove for 
quarter of an hour, occasionally stirring it ; then let it cool ; 
mix with it the butter, sugar and eggs, which should be well 
beaten, and flavor with either of the above ingredients. Butter 
a pie-dish, and line the edges with puff -paste ; put in the pud- 
ding, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour. If the pud- 
ding is boiled, add a little more tapioca, and boil it in a but- 
tered basin one and a half hours. 

Blanc-Mange. — One quarter pound of sugar, one quart of 
milk, one and a half ounces of isinglass, the rind of half a 
lemon, four laurel leaves. Put all the ingredients into a lined 
saucepan, and boil gently until the isinglass is dissolved; taste 
it occasionally to ascertain when it is sufficiently flavored with 
the laurel leaves ; then take them out, and keep stirring the 
mixture over the lire for about ten minutes. Strain it through 
a fine sieve into a jug, and, when nearly cold, pour it into a 
well-oiled mould, omitting the sediment at the bottom. Turn 
it out carefully on a dish, and garnish with preserves, bright 
jelly, or a compote of fruit. 

Ivory Blanc-Mange.— Soak one ounce of gelatine for ten 
minutes in a little cold milk and pour over the gelatine, and 
stir it constantly until it is all dissolved ; it may be placed in 
the dish and set on top of a boiling tea-kettle for a few min- 
utes ; remove it and add a small cupful of sugar and two 
tablespoonfuls of sherry wine. Strain into moulds. 

Rice Blanc-Mange.— One quarter pound of ground rice, 
three ounces of loaf sugar, one ounce of fresh butter, one 
quart of milk, flavoring of lemon peel, essence of almonds 
or vanilla, or laurel leaves. Mix the rice to a smooth batter 
with about one-half pint of the milk, and the remainder put in 
a saucepan, with the sugar, butter, and whichever of the above 
flavorings may be preferred ; bring the milk to the boiling 
point, quickly stir in the rice, and let it boil for about ten 
minutes, or until it comes easily away from the saucepan, 
keeping it well stirred the whole time. Grease a mould with 
pure salad oil ; pour in the rice, and let it get perfectly set, 
when it should turn out quite easily ; garnish it witli jam, or 



— 141 — 

pour round a compote of any kind of fruit, just before it is 
sent to table. This blanc-mange is better for being made the 
day before it is wanted, as it then has time to become firm. If 
laurel leaves are used for flavoring, steep three of them in the 
milk, and take them out before the rice is added ; about eight 
drops of essence of almonds, or from twelve to sixteen drops 
of essence of vanilla, would be required to flavor the above 
proportion of milk. 

Apple Trifle. — Ten good-sized apples, the rind of one half 
lemon, six ounces of pounded sugar, one-half pint of milk, 
one-half pint of cream, two eggs, whipped cream. Peel, core, 
and cut the apples into thin slices, and put them into a sauce- 
pan, with two tablespoonfuls of water, the sugar, and minced 
lemon rind. Boil all together until quite tender, and pulp the 
apples through a sieve ; if they should not be quite sweet 
enough, add a little more sugar, and put them at the bottom 
of the dish to form a thick layer. Stir together the milk, 
cream, and eggs, with a little sugar over the fire, and let the 
mixture thicken, but do not allow it to reach the boiling point. 
When thick, take it off the fire ; let it cool a little, then pour 
it over the apples. Whip some cream with sugar, lemon peel, 
etc. , tlie same as for other trifles ; heap it high over the cus- 
tard, and the dish is ready for table. It may be garnished as 
fancy dictates, with strips of bright apple jelly, slices of cit- 
ron, etc. 

Lemon Trifle.— Juice of two lemons and grated peel of one, 
one pint cream, well sweetened and whipped stiff, one cup of 
sherry, a little nutmeg. Let sugar, lemon-juice, and peel lie 
together two hours before you add wine and nutmeg. Strain 
through double tarlatan, and whip gradually into the frothed 
cream. Serve very soon, heaped in small glasses. Pass cake 
with this, as well as with the tea. 

Floating Island. — Take a quart of rich cream, and divide it 
in half. Sweeten one pint of it with loaf sugar, and stir 
into sufficient currant jelly to color it a fine pink. Put it 
into a glass bowl, and place in the center a pile of sliced al- 
mond sponge cake, or of lady cake; every slice spread thickly 
with raspberry jam or marmalade, and laid evenly one on an- 
other. Have ready the other pint of cream, flavored with the 
juice of two lemons, and beaten to a stiff froth. Heap it all 



— 142 — 

over tlie pile of cake so as entirely to cover it. Both creams 
must be made very sweet. 

Apple Snow. — Forms a showy, sweet dish, and may be made 
as follows: Ten or a dozen apples prepared as before, flavored 
with a little lemon juice; when reduced to a pulp let them stand 
to cool for a little time, meanwhile beat up the whites of ten or 
a dozen eggs to a froth, and stir into the apples, as also some 
sifted sugar, say a teacupful ; stir till the mixture begins to 
stiffen, and then heap it up in a glass dish or serve in custard 
cups, ornamented with spots of red currant jelly. Thick cream 
should at table be ladled out to the snow. 

Tropical Snow. — Ten sweet oranges, one cocoanut, pared 
and grated, two glasses sherry, one cup powdered sugar, six 
bananas. Peel and cut the oranges small, taking out the seeds. 
Put a layer in a glass-bowl and wet with wine, then strew with 
sugar. Next, put a layer of grated cocoanut, slice the bananas 
thin, and cover the cocoanut with them When the dish has 
been filled in this order, heap with cocoanut. Eat soon or the 
oranges will toughen. 

Swiss Cream. — One-quarter pound of macaroons or six 
small sponge-cakes, sherry, one pint of cream, five ounces of 
lump sugar, two large tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, the rind 
of one lemon, the juice of half a lemon, three tablespoonfuls of 
milk. Lay the macaroons or sponge-cakes in a glass dish, 
and pour over them as much sherry as will cover them, or 
sufficient to soak them well. Put the cream into a lined 
saucepan, with the sugar and lemon rind, and let it remain by 
the side of the fire until the cream is well flavored, when take 
out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the 
cold milk ; add this to the cream, and let it boil gently for 
about three minutes, keeping it well stirred. Take it off the 
fire, stir till nearly cold, when add the lemon-juice, and pour 
the whole over the cakes. Garnish the cream with strips of 
angelica, or candied citron cut thin, or bright-colored jelly or 
preserve. This cream is exceedingly delicious, flavored with 
vanilla instead of lemon ; when this flavoring is used, the 
sherry may be omitted, and the mixture poured over the dry 
cakes. - 

Italian Cream. — Take one quart of cream, one pint of milk 
sweetened very sweet, and highly seasoned with sherry wine 



— 143 — 

and vanilla ; beat it with a whip dasher, and remove the froth 
as it rises, until it is all converted into froth. Have ready one 
box of Cox's sparkling gelatine dissolved in a little warm 
water ; set your frothed cream into a tub of ice ; pour the gel- 
atine into it, and stir constantly until it thickens, then pour 
into moulds, and set in a cool place. 

Whipped Cream. — Mix one pint of cream with nine table- 
spoons of fine sugar and one gill of wine in a large bowl ; whip 
these with the cream dasher, and as the froth rises, skim inta 
the dish in which it is to be served. Fill the dish full to the 
top, and ornament with kisses or macaroons. 

Tipsy Cake.— One moulded sponge or Savoy cake, sufficient 
sweet wine or sherry to soak it, six tablespoonfuls of brandy, 
two ounces of sweet almonds, one pint of rich custard. Pro- 
cure a cake that is three or four days old — either sponge, Sa- 
voy, or rice answering for the purpose of a tipsy cake. Cut 
the bottom of the cake level, to make it stand firm in the dish; 
make a small hole in the centre, and pour in and over the cake 
sufficient sweet wine or sherry, mixed with the above propor- 
tion of brandy, to soak it nicely. When the cake is well soaked, 
blanch and cut the almonds into strips, stick them all over the 
cake, and pour round it a good custard, allowing eight eggs- 
instead of five to the pint of milk. The cakes are sometimes 
crumbled and soaked, and a whipped cream heaped over them, 
the same as for trifles. 

Snow Pyramids. — Beat to a stiff foam the whites of half a 
dozen eggs, add a small teacupful of currant jelly, and whip 
all together again Fill as many saucers as you have guests 
half full of cream, dropping in the centre of each saucer a 
tablespoonful of the beaten eggs and jelly in the shape of a 
pyramid. 

An Excellent Dessert.— One can or twelve large peaches, 
two coffee cups of sugar, one pint of water, and the whites of 
three eggs ; break the peaches with and stir all the ingredi- 
ents together : freeze the whole into form ; beat the eggs to a 
froth. 

Apple Fritters. — One teacup of sweet milk, one tablespoon 
of sweet light dough dissolved in milk, three eggs beaten sepa- 
rately, one teaspoon of salt, one and a half tea cups of flour, 
one tablespoon of sugar, and the grated peel of a lemon, peeled 



— 144 — 

apples sliced without the core, drop into hot lard with a piece 
of apple in each one ; sprinkle with powdered or spiced sugar. 
Let them stand after making and they will be lighter. Good. 

Jelly-Cake Fritters. — Some stale sponge, or plain cup cake, 
cut into rounds with a cake-cutter. Hot lard, strawberry or 
other jam, or jelly, a little boiling milk. Cut the cake care- 
fully and fry a nice brown. Dip each slice for a second in a 
bowl of boiling milk, draining this off on the side of the ves- 
sel ; lay on a hot dish and spread thickly with strawberry jam, 
peach jelly, or other delicate conserve. Pile them neatly and 
send around hot, with cream to pour over them. This is a 
nice way of using up stale cake, and if rightly prepared, the 
dessert is almost equal to Neapolis tan pudding. 

Peach Meringue. — Pare and quarter (removing stones) a 
quart of sound, ripe peaches, place them all in a dish that it 
will not injure to set in the oven and yet be suitable to place 
on the table. Sprinkle the peaches with sugar, and cover them 
well with the beaten whites of three eggs. Stand the dish in 
the oven, until the eggs have become a delicate brown, then 
remove and, when cool enough, set the dish on ice, or in a very 
cool place. Take the yolks of the eggs, add to them a pint of 
milk, sweeten and flavor and boil same in a custard kettle, 
being careful to keep the eggs from curdling. When cool, 
pour into a glass pitcher and serve with the meringue when 
ready to use. 

Charlotte Russe. — Whip one quart rich cream to a stiff 
froth, and drain well on a nice sieve. To one scant pint milk 
add six eggs, beaten very light ; make very sweet ; flavor 
high with vanilla. Cook over hot water till it is a thick cus- 
tard. Soak one full ounce Cox's gelatine in a very little water, 
and warm over hot water. When the custard is very cold, 
beat in lightly the gelatine and the whipped cream. Line the 
bottom of your mould with buttered paper, the sides with 
sponge cake, or lady fingers, fastened together with the white 
of an egg. Fill with the cream, put in a cold place, or in sum- 
mer, on i?e. To turn out, dip the mould for a moment in hot 
water. In draining the whipped cream, all that drips through 
can be re whipped. 

Jellied Grapes. — A very delicate dish is made of one-third 
of a cup of rice, two cups of grapes, half a cup of water, and 



— 145 — 

two spoons of sugar. Sprinkle the rice and sugar among the 
grapes, while placing them in a deep dish ; pour on the water, 
cover close, and simmer two hours slowly in the oven. Serve 
cream as sauce, or cold, as pudding. If served warm, as pud- 
ding, increase slightly the proportion of rice and sugar. 

Jelly and Custard. — One-half package of gelatine, soaked 
in water enough to cover it ; when soaked, pour one pnit of 
boiling water over it, then add one cup of white sugar, and 
squeeze the juice of one large lemon into it and a little essence 
of lemon, and set aside to stififen. ,sl ; Iqs 

Make a custard with a pint and a half of milk, the yolks of 
three eggs, one tablespoonful of corn starch ; sugar and fla- 
voring. When the jell/ is set, and just before using, cut the 
jelly into squares, laying them in layers, at intervals, in the 
bottom of the dish ; then pour in some of the cold custard, an- 
other layer of jelly, and so on, until the custard is all used. 
Beat the Avhites of the eggs to a stiff froth, adding two or three 
teaspoonf uls of confectioner's sugar, and lay on in pieces, with 
jelly between. All these recipes are best when prepared in a 
tin set inside of another, in which there is a little water, to 
prevent danger of burning. 

Lemon Toast. — Take the yolks of six eggs, beat them well, 
and add three cups of sweet milk ; take baker s bread, not too 
stale, and cut into slices ; dip them into the milk and eggs, 
and lay the slices into a spider, with sufficient melted butter, 
hot, to fry a nice delicate brown ; take the whites of the six 
eggs, and beat them to a froth, adding a large cup of white 
sugar ; add the juice of two lemons, heating well, and adding 
two cups boiling water. Serve over the toast, as a sauce, and 
you will find it a very delicious dish. 

Dish of Snow, Whipped Cream. — To the whites of three 
eggs, beaten to a froth, add a pint of cream and four table- 
spoonfuls of sweet wine, with three of fine white sugar and a 
teaspoonf ul of extract of lemon or vanilla ; whip it to a froth, 
and serve in a glass dish ; serve jelly or jam with it. Or. lay 
lady fingers or sliced sponge cake in a glass dish, put spoon- 
fuls of jelly or jam over, and heap the snow upon it. 

Omelet for Dessert. — Beat six eggs light, add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and four or five macai'oons, pounded fine ; beat 



— 14G — 

them well together ; fry, as usual, strew plentifully with, 
sugar, and serve. 

Jelly Fritters. — Make a batter of two eggs, a pint of milk, 
and a pint bowl of wheat flour or more ; beat it light ; put a 
tablespoonful of lard or beef fat in a frying or omelet pan, 
add a saltspoonf ul of salt, make it boiling _hot, put in the bat- 
ter by the large spoonful, not too close ; when one side is a 
delicate brown, turn the other; when done, take them on to a 
dish, with a doyly over it, put a dessert spoonful of firm jelly 
or jam on each, and serve, 



PRESERVES, CANNED FRUITS, JELIvY. 

To Preserve Plums without the Skins. — Pour boiling water 
over large egg, or magnum bonum plums, cover them until 
cold, then pull off the skins. Make a syrup of a pound of 
sugar and a teacup of water for each pound of fruit, make it 
boiling hot, and pour it over ; let them remain for a da}^ or 
two, then drain it off, and boil a.gain ; skim it clear, and pour 
it hot over plums ; let them remain until the next day, then 
put them over the fire in the syrup, boil them very gently un- 
til clear : take them from the syrup, with a skimmer, into the 
pots or jars ; boil the syrup until rich and thick, take off any 
skum which may rise, then let it cool and settle, and pour it 
over the plums. If brown sugar is used, which is quite as 
good except for greengages, clarify it, as directed. 

To Preserve Purple Plums. — Make a syrup of clean brown 
sugar, clarify it as directed in these recipes; when perfectly 
clear and boiling hot, pour it over the plums, having picked 
out all unsound ones, and stems; let them remain in the syrup 
two days, then drain it off; make it boiling hot, skim it and 
pour it over again ; let them remain in the syrup two days, 
then drain it off; make it boiling hot, skim it and pour it over 
again; let them remain another day or two, then put them in 
a preserving kettle over the fire, and simmer gently until the 
syrup is reduced and thick or rich. One pound of sugar for 
each pound of plums. Small damsons are very fine, preserved 



— 147 — 

as cherries or any other ripe fruit; clarify the syrup and when 
boiling hot put in the plums ; let them boil very gently until 
they are cooked and the syrup rich. Put them in pots or jars; 
the next day secure as directed. 

Preserved Greengages in Syrup. — To every pound of fruit 
allow one pound of loaf sugar, one quarter pint of water. Boil 
the sugar and water together for about ten minutes; divide 
the greengages, take out the stones, put the fruit into the 
syrup, and let it simmer gently until nearly tender. Take it 
off the fire, put it into a large pan, and, the next day, boil it 
np again for about ten minutes with the kernels from the 
stones, which should be blanched. Put the fruit carefully into 
jars, pour over it the syrup, and, when cold, cover down, so 
that the air is quite excluded. Let the syrup be well skimmed 
"both the first and second day of boiling, otherwise it will not 
be clear. 

To Preserve Cherries in Syrup. — Four pounds of clierries, 
three pounds of sugar, one pint of white-currant juice. Let 
the cherries be as clear and as transparent as possible, and 
perfectly ripe; pick off the stalks, and remove the stones, 
damaging the fruit as little as you can. Make a syrup with 
the above proportion of sugar, mix the cherries with it, and 
boil tliem for about fifteen minutes, carefully skimming them; 
turn them gently into a pan, and let them remain till the next 
day; then drain the cherries on a sieve, and put the syrup and 
white-currant juice into the preserving- pan again. Boil these 
together until the syrup is somewhat reduced and rather thick; 
then put in the cherries, and let them boil for about five min- 
utes; take them off the fire, skim the syrup, put the cherries 
into small pots or wide-mouthed bottles; pour the syrup over, 
and when quite cold, tie them down carefully, so that the air 
is quite excluded. 

Preserved Pears. — To six pounds of pears, four pounds of 
sugar, two coffee cups of water, the juice of two lemons, and 
the rind of one, a handful of whole ginger; boil all together 
for twenty minutes, then put in your pears and boil till soft, 
say about a quarter of an hour; take them out and boil your 
syrup a little longer; then put back your fruit and give it a 
boil; bottle while hot; add a little cochineal to give them a 
nice color. 



— 1 4S — 

To Preserve Peaches. — Peaches for preservmg may be ripe 
but not soft; cut them in lialves, take out the stones, and pare 
them neatly; take as many pounds Of white sugar as of fruit, 
put to each pound of sugar a teacup of water; stir it until it is 
dissolved, set it over a moderate fire, when it is boiling hot, 
put in the peaches, let them boil gently until a pure, clear, 
uniform color; turn those at the bottom to the top carefully 
with a skimmer several times; do not hurry them; when they 
are clear, take each half up with a spoon, and spread the 
halves on flat dishes to become cold; when all are done, let 
the syrup boil until it is quite thick, pour it into a large 
pitcher, and let it set to cool and settle. When the peaches 
are cold put them carefully into jars, and pour the syrup over 
them, leaving any sediment which has settled at the bottom, 
or strain the syrup. Some of the kernels from the peach 
stones may be put in with the peaches while boiling. Let them 
remain open one night, then cover. 

To Preserve Citron. — Pare the citrons and cut them into 
slices about an inch and a half thick, then into strips the same 
thickness, leaving them the full length of the fruit; take out 
all the seeds with a small knife, then weigh, and to each pound 
of citron put a pound of white sugar, make a syrup; to ten 
pounds put a pint of water, and simmer gently for twenty 
minutes; then put in the citron and boil for one hour, or un- 
til tender; before taking off the fire put in two lemons, sliced 
thin, seeds taken out, and two ounces of root ginger; do not 
let them boil long after the lemon and ginger are put in; do 
not stir them while boiling. The above is very fine if care- 
fully attended to. 

Crab-Apples. — To each pound of fruit allow half a pound of 
sugar, and a pint of water to three pounds of sugar. When 
the syrup is boiling hot, drop in the apples. They will cook 
very quickly. When done, fill a jar with the fruit, and fill it 
up with syrup. 

Pineapple. — Pare the fruit, and be sure you take out all the 
eyes and discolored parts. Cut in slices, and cut the slices in 
small bits, taking out the core. Weigh the fruit, and put in a 
pan with half as many pounds of sugar as of fruit. Let it 
stand over night. In the morning put it over the fire and let 
it boil rapidly for a minute only, as cooking long discolors it. 
Put it in the jars as directed. 



— uo — 

Gooseberry Jam. — To every eight pounds of red, rough, ripe 
gooseberries, allow one quart of red-currant juice, five pounds 
of loaf sugar. Have the fruit gathered in dry weather, and 
cut off the tops and tails. Prepare one quart of red-currant 
juice, the same as for red-currant jelly; put it into a preserv- 
ing-pan with the sugar, and keep stirring until the latter is 
dissolved. Keep it boiling for about five minutes; skim well; 
then put in the gooseberries, and let them boil from one-half 
to three-quarters of an hour; then turn the whole into an 
earthen pan, and let it remain for two daj's. Boil the jam up 
again until it looks clear; put it into pots, and when cold 
cover with oiled paper, and over the jars put tissue paper, 
brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg, and store 
away in a dry place. Care must be taken in making this to 
keep the jam well stirred and well skimmed, to prevent it 
burning at the bottom of the pan, and to have it very clear. 

Black Currant Jam. — Pick the currants carefully, and take 
equal quantities of fruit and sugar. Pounded loaf sugar is 
best. Dissolve it over or mix it with the currants. Put in a 
very little water, or red currant juice, boil, and skim for 
twenty-five minutes. 

Raspberry Jam. — To five or six pounds of fine red raspber- 
ries (not too ripe) add an equal quantity of the finest quality 
of white sugar. Mash the whole well in a preserving kettle; 
add about one quart of currant juice (a little less will do), and 
boil gently until it jellies upon a cold plate ; then put into 
small jars; cover with brandied paper, and tie a thick white 
paper over them. Keep in a dark, dry and cool place. 

Quince Preserve. — Pare, core, and quarter your fruilr, then 
weigh it, and allow an equal quantity of white sugar. Take 
the peelings and cores, and put in a preserving kettle ; cover 
them with water, and boil for half an hour; then strain through 
a hair sieve, and put the juice back into the kettle, and boil 
the quinces in it, a little at a time, until they are tender ; lift 
out, as they are done, with a drainer, and lay on a dish ; if 
the liquid seems scarce add more water. When all are done, 
throw in the sugar, and allow it to boil ten minutes before 
putting in the quinces ; let them boil until they change color, 
say one hour and a quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are 
boiling, occasionally slip a silver spoon under them, to see that 



— 150 — 

they do not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two 
fresli lemons, cut in thin slices, and when tlie fruit is being 
put in jars, lay a slice or tw - in each. 

Red Currant Jelly. — Red currants ; to every pint of juice 
allow three-quarters pound of loaf sugar. Have the fruit 
gathered in fine weather ; pick it from the stalks, put it into 
a jar, and place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water over 
the fire, and let it simmer gently until the juice is well drawn 
from the currants ; then strain them through a jelly bag of 
fine cloth, and, if the jelly is wanted very clear, do not squeeze 
them too much, as the skin and pulp from the fruit will be 
pressed through with the juice, and so make the jelly muddy. 
Measure the juice, and to each pint allow three-qunrters pound 
of loaf sugar ; put these into a preserving pan, set it over the 
fire, and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully re- 
moving every particle of scum as it rises, using a wooden or 
silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil 
the color of the jelly. When it has boiled from twenty min- 
utes to a half hour, put a little of the jelly on a plate, and if 
firm when cool, it is done. Take it off the fire, pour it into 
small gallipots, cover each of the pots with an oiled paper, and 
then with a piece of tissue paper, brushed over on both sides 
with the white of an egg. Label the pots, adding the year 
when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry place. A 
jam may be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed 
too dry, by adding a few fresh raspberries, and boiling all to- 
gether, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. As this pre- 
serve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate 
eating, a smaller proportion of sugar than usual will be found 
enough ; it answers very well for children's puddings, or for 
a nursery preserve. 

Apple Jelly. — Apples, water ; to every pint of syrup allow 
three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar. Pare and cut the ap- 
ples into pieces, remove the cores, and put them in a preserv- 
ing pan, with sufficient cold water to cover them. Let them 
boil for an hour ; then drain the syrup from them through a 
hair sieve, or jelly bag, and measure the juice ; to every pint 
allow three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, and boil these 
together for three-quarters of an hour, removing every parti- 
cle of scum as it rises, and keeping the jelly well stirred, that 



— 151 — 

it may not burn. A little lemon-rind may be boiled with the 
apples, and a small quantity of strained lemon juice may be 
put in the jelly just before it is done, when the flavor is liked. 
This jelly may be ornamented with preserved greengages, or 
any other preserved fruit, and will turn out very prettily for 
dessert. It should be stored away in small pots. 

Black Currant Jelly.— Pick each currant individually, and 
heat the lot in a jar set in boiling water; squeeze as before, and 
allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar ; a little water may 
be added if thought proper, or a little red-currant juice. Boil 
for half an hour, carefully removing the skimmings. Another 
way : Clarify the sugar, and add the fruit to it whole ; boil 
for twenty minutes, and strain, then boil a few minutes addi- 
tional. Pot it, and paper it when cool. The refuse berries 
may be kept as black-currant jam, for tarts, dumplings, etc. 

Crab Apple Jelly. — Wash the fruit clean, put in a kettle, 
cover with water, and boil until thoroughly cooked. Then 
pour it into a sieve, and let it drain. Do not press it through. 
For each pint of this liquor allow one pound of sugar. Boil 
from twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Other Jellies. — Jellies can be made from quinces, peaches 
and apples, by following the directions for crab-apple jelly. 

Wine Jelly. — One box of Cox's gelatine, dissolved in one pint 
of cold water, one pint of wine, one quart of boiling water, 
one quart of granulated sugar, and three lemons. 

Calve's Feet Jelly.— Should be made, at any rate, the day 
before it is required. It is a simple affair to prepare it. Pro- 
cure a couple of feet, and put them on the fire in three quarts 
of water ; let them boil for five hours, during which keep skim- 
ming. Pass the liquor through a hair sieve into a basin, and 
let it firm, after w4iich remove all the oil and fat. Next, take 
a teacupful of water, two wineglassfuls of sherry, the juice of 
half a dozen lemons and the rind of one, the whites and shells 
of five eggs, half a pound of fine white sugar, and whisk the 
whole till the sugar is melted ; then add the jelly, place the 
whole on the fire in an enameled stewpan, and keep actively 
stirring till the composition comes to the boil ; pass it twice 
through a jelly bag, and then place it in the moulds. 

Orange Marmalade. Allow pound for pound. Pare half 
the oranges, and cut the rind into shreds. Boil in three waters

until tender, and set aside. Grate the rind of the remaining 
oranges; take off, and throw away every bit of the thick white 
inner skin ; quarter all the oranges, and take out the seeds. 
Chop, or cut them into small pieces ; drain all the juice that 
will come away, without pressing them, over the sugar ; heat 
this, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, adding a ver?/ litt'e 
water, unless the oranges are very juicy. Boil and skim five 
or six minutes ; put in the boiled shreds, and cook ten min- 
utes ; then the chopped fruit and grated peel, and boil twenty 
minutes longer. When cold, put into small jars, tied up with 
bladder, or with paper, next the fruit, cloths dipped in wax 
over all. A nicer way still, is to put away in tumblers, with 
self-adjusting metal tops. Press brandied tissue paper down 
closely to the fruit. 

Lemon Marmalade. — Is made as you would prepare orange 
— allowing a pound and a quarter of sugar to a pound of the 
fruit, and using but half the grated peel. 

Quince Marmalade.— Gather the fruit when fully ripe; pare, 
quarter and core it ; boil the skins with as many teacupfuls of 
water as you have pounds of quinces ; when they are soft, 
mash them, and strain the water from them, and put it to the 
quinces ; boil them until they are soft enough to mash them 
fine ; rub them through a sieve ; put to the pulp as many 
pounds of sugar; stir them together, and set them over a gen- 
tle fire until it will fall from a spoon, like jelly, or try some in 
a saucer. If it jellies when cold, it is enough. 

Put it in pots or tumblers, and when cold, secure, as directed 
for jelly. 

Peach Marmalade. — Peel ripe peaches, stone them, and cut 
them small ; weigh three-quarters of a pound of sugar for 
each pound of cut fruit, and a teacup of water for each pound 
of sugar; set it over the fire; when it boils, skim it clear, then 
put in the peaches, let them boil quite fast ; mash them fine, 
and let them boil until the whole is a jellied mass, and thick, 
then put it in small jars or tumblers ; when cold, secure it, as 
directed for jellies. Half a pound of sugar for a pound of fruit, 
will make nice marmalade. 

Apple Butter. — Boil one barrel of new cider down half, peel 
and core three bushels of good cooking apples ; when the cider 
has boiled to half the quantity, add the apples, and when soft, 



— 15:5 — 

stir constantly for from eight to ten hours. If done, it will 
adhere to an inverted plate. Put. away in stone jars (not 
earthen ware), covering first with writing paper, cut to fit the 
jar, and press down closely upon the apple butter ; cover the 
v/hole with thick brown paper, snugly tied down. 

Lemon Butter. — Beat six eggs, one-fourth pound butter, 
one pound sugar, the rind and juice of three lemons ; mixed 
together, and set in a pan of hot water to cook. Very nice for 
tarts, or to eat with bread. 

Peach Butter. — Take pound for pound of peaches and sugar; 
cook peaches alone until they become soft, then put in one- 
half the sugar, and stir for one-half hour ; then the remainder 
of sugar, and stir an hour and a half. Season with cloves and 
cinnamon. 

Apple Ginger. — A Dessert Dish. — Two pounds of any kind 
of hard apples, two pounds of loaf sugar, one and one-half 
pints of water, one ounce of tincture of ginger. Boil the sugar 
and water until they form a rich syrup, adding the ginger 
when it boils up. Pare, core, and cut the apples into pieces ; 
dip them in cold water to preserve the color, and boil them in 
the syrup until transparent ; but be careful not to let them 
break. Put the pieces of apple into jars, pour over the syrup, 
and carefully exclude the air, by well covering them. It will 
remain good some time, if kept in a dry place. 

Iced Currants. — One-quarter pint of water, the whites of 
two eggs, currants, pounded sugar. Select very fine bunches 
of red or white currants, and well beat the whites of the eggs. 
Mix these with water ; then take the currants, a bunch at a 
time, and dip them in ; let them drain for a minute or two, 
and roll them in very finely pounded sugar. Lay them to dry 
on paper, when the sugar will crystallize round each currant, 
and have a very pretty effect. All fresh fruit may be pre- 
pared in the same manner ; and a mixture of various fruits 
iced in this manner, and arranged on one dish, looks very well 
for a summer dessert. 

To Bottle Fruit Butter. — Very Useful in AVinter, — 
Fresh fruit, such as currants, raspberries, cherries, goose- 
berries, plums of all kinds, damsons, etc.; wide-mouthed glass 
bottles, new corks to fit them tightly. Let the fruit be full 
grown, but not too ripe, and gathered in dry weather. Pick 



— 154 — 

it off the stalks without bruising or breaking the skin, and 
reject any that is at all blemished ; if gathered in the damp, 
or if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will mould. Have ready 
some perfectly dry glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks 
or bungs ; burn a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, and 
quickly place the fruit in to be preserved ; gently cork the 
bottles, and put them into a very cool oven, where let them re- 
main until the fruit has shrunk away a fourth part. Then 
take the bottles out ; do not open them, but immediately beat 
the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and cover them with melted 
resin. If kept in a dry place, the fruit will remain good for 
months; and on this principally depends the success of the 
preparation, for if stored away in a place that is the least 
damp, the fruit will soon spoil. 

To Green Fruit for Preserving in Sugar or Vinegar. — Ap- 
ples, pears, limes, plums, apricots, etc., for preserving or pick- 
ling, may be greened thus: Put vine-leaves under, between, 
and over the fruit in a preserving kettle ; put small bits of 
alum, the size of a pea, say a dozen bits to a kettlefull ; put 
enough'water to cover the fruit, cover the kettle close to ex- 
clude all outer air, set it over a gentle fire, let them simmer ; 
when they are tender drain off the water; if they are not a fine 
green let them become cold, then put vine-leaves and a bit of 
saleratus or soda with them, and set them over a slow fire 
until they begin to simmer ; a bit of soda or saleratus the size 
of a small nutmeg will have the desired effect ; then spread 
them out to cool, after which finish as severally directed. 

To Color Preserves Pink. — By putting in with it a little 
cochineal powdered fine, then finish in the syrup. 

To Color Fruit Yellow. — Boil the fruit with fresh skin 
lemons in water to cover them, until it is tender ; then take 
it up, spread it on dishes to cool, and finish as may be 
directed. 

Canned Strawberries. — After the berries are pulled, let as 
many as can be put carefully in tiie preserve kettle at once 
be placed on a platter. To each pound of fruit add three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar ; let them stand two or three 
hours, till the juice is drawn from them, pour it in the kettle 
and let it come to a boil, and remove the scum which rises ; 
then put in the berries very carefully. As soon as they come 



— 155 — 

thoroughly to a boil put them in warm jars, and seal while 
boiling hot. Be sure the cans are air-tight. 

Canned Peaches — Select some fine, free-stone peaches ; 
pare, cut in two and stone them. Immerse in cold water, 
taking care not to break the fruit. See that the peaches are 
not over ripe. Place in the kettle, scattering sugar between 
the layers — the sugar should be in the proportion of a full 
tablespoonful to a quart of fruit. To prevent burning put a 
little water in the kettle. Heat slowly to a boil, then boil for 
three or four minutes. Can and seal the fruit. 

Canned Pears — Prepare and can precisely like peaches in 
preceding recipe, except that they require longer cooking. 
When done they are easily pierced with a silver fork. 

Canned Plums. — To every pound of fruit allow three-quar- 
ters of a pound of sugar ; for the thin syrup, a quarter of a 
pound of sugar to each pint of water. Select fine fruit, and 
prick with a needle to prevent bursting. Simmer gently in a 
syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water. 
Let them boil not longer than five minutes. Put the plums in 
a jar, pour in the liot syrup, and seal. Greengages are also 
delicious done in this manner. 

Canned Currants. — Look them over carefully, stem and 
weigh them, allowing a pound of sugar to every one of fruit ; 
put them in a kettle, cover, and leave them to heat slowly 
and stew gently for twenty or thirty minutes ; then add the 
sugar, and shake the kettle occasionally to make it mix with the 
fruit ; do not allow it to boil, but keep as hot as possible until 
the sugar is dissolved, then pour it in cans and secure the covers 
at once. White currants are beautiful preserved in this way. 

Canned Pineapple. — For six pounds of fruit when cut and 
read}' to can make syrup with two and a half pounds of sugar 
and nearly three pints of water ; boil syrup five minutes and 
skim or strain if necessary ; then add the fruit, and let it boil 
up ; have cans hot, fill and shut up as soon as possible. Use the 
best white sugar. As the cans cool, keep tightening them up. 

To Can Quinces. — Cut the quinces into thin slices like ap- 
ples for pies. To one quart jarful of quinces take a coffee- 
saucer and a half of sugar and a coffee-cup of water ; put the 
sugar and water on the fire, and when boiling put in the 
quinces ; have ready the jars with their fastenings, stand the 



— 156 — 

jars in a pan of boiling water on the stove, and when the 
quince is clear and tender put rapidly into the jars, fruit and 
syrup together. The jars must be filled so that the syrup over- 
flows, and fastened up tight as quickly as possible. 

Canning Tomatoes. — Scald your tomatoes, remove the 
skins, cut in small pieces, put in a porcelain kettle, salt to 
taste, and boil fifteen minutes ; have tin cans filled with hot 
water ; pour the water out and fill with tomatoes ; solder tops 
on immediately with shellac and rosin melted together. 

Canned Corn. — dissolve an ounce tartaric acid in half tea- 
cup water, and take one tablespoon to two quarts of sweet 
corn ; cook, and while boiling hot, fill the cans, which should 
be tin. When used turn into a colander, rinse with cold 
water, add a little soda and sugar while cooking, and season 
with butter, pepper and salt. 



ICES, ICE-CREAIVI, CANDY. 

Currant Ice. — One pint of currant juice, one pound of sugar, 
and pint of water ; put in freezer, and when partly frozen add 
the whites of three eggs well beaten. 

Strawberry or Raspberry Ice.— One quart of berries. Ex- 
tract the juice and strain ; one pint of sugar, dissolved in the 
juice ; one lemon, juice only ; half pint of water. 

Orange and Lemon Ices. — The rind of three oranges grated 
and steeped a few moments in a little more than a pint of 
water ; strain one pint of this on a pound of sugar, and then 
add one pint of orange or lemon juice ; pour in the freezer, 
and when half frozen add the whites of four eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth. 

Ice-Cream.— One quart of new milk, two eggs, two table- 
spoons of corn-starch ; heat the milk in a dish set in hot water, 
then stir in the corn-starch mixed smooth in a little of the 
milk ; let it boil for one or two minutes, then remove from 
stove and cool, and stir in the egg and a half pound of sugar. 
If to be extra nice, add a pint of rich cream, and one-fourth 



— 157 — 

pound of sugar, strain the mixture, and when cool add the 
flavoring, and freeze as follows : Prepare freezer in the usual 
manner, turn the crank one hundred times, then pour upon 
the ice and salt a quart of boiling water from the tea-kettle. 
Fill up again with ice and salt, turn the crank fifty times one 
way and twenty-five the other (which serves to scrape the 
cream from sides of freezer) ; by this time it will turn very 
hard, indicating that the cream is frozen sufficiently. 

Vanilla or Lemon Ice-Cream. — Take two drachms of vanilla 
or lemon-peel, one quart of milk, half a pound of sugar, one 
pint of cream, and the yolks of three eggs ; beat the yolks 
well, an 1 stir them with the milk, then add the other ingre- 
dients ; set it over a moderate fire, and stir it constantly with 
a silver spoon until it is boiling hot, then take out the lemon 
peel or vanilla, and, when cold, freeze it. 

Strawberry Ice-Cream. — Sprinkle strawberries with sugar, 
wash well and rub through a sieve ; to a pint of the juice add 
half a pint of good cream ; make it very sweet ; freeze, and 
when beginning to set, stir lightly one pint of cream whipped, 
and lastly a handful of whole strawberries, sweetened. It 
may then be put in a mould and imbedded in ice, or kept in 
the freezer ; or mash with a potato-pounder in an earthen bowl 
one quart of strawberries with one pound of sugar, rub it 
through a colander, add one quart of sweet cream and freeze. 
Or, if not in the strawberry season, use^ the French bottled 
strawberries (or any canned ones), mix juice with half a pint 
of cream, sweeten and freeze ; when partially set add whipped 
cream and strawberries. 

Chocolate Ice-Cream. — Take six ounces of chocolate, a pint 
of cream, half a pint of new milk, and half a pint of sugar. 
Rub the chocolate down into the milk and mix thoroughly, 
adding the cream and sugar. The milk should be heated al- 
most to boiling. Heat until it thickens, stirring constantly. 
Strain and set aside to cool, afterwards freeze. This makes 
perhaps the most favorite of ice-creams. 

Cream Candies. — Three and one-half pounds of sugar to one 
and one-half pints of water ; dissolve in the water before put- 
ting with the sugar one-quarter of an ounce of fine white gum 
arable, and when added to the sugar put in one teaspoon of 
cream of tartar. The candy should not be boiled quite to the 



— 158 — 

brittle stage. The proper degree can be ascertained if, when 
a small skimmer is put in and taken out, when blowing 
through the holes of the skimmer, the melted sugar is forced 
through in feathery filaments ; remove from the fire at this 
point and rub the syrup against the sides of the dish with an 
iron spoon. If it is to be a chocolate candy, add two ounces 
of chocolate finely sifted and such flavoring as you prefer, va- 
nilla, rose or orange. If you wish to make cocoanut candy, 
add this while soft, and stir until cold. 

Pineapple Ice-Cream. — Three pints of cream, two large ripe 
pineapples, two pounds powdered sugar ; slice the pineapples 
thin, scatter the sugar between the slices, cover and let the 
fruit stand three hours, cut or chop it up in the syrup, and 
strain through a hair sieve or double bag of coarse lace ; beat 
gradually into the cream, and freeze as rapidly as possible ; 
reserve a few pieces of pineapple unsugared, cut into square 
bits, and stir through cream when half frozen, first a pint of 
well-whipped cream, and then the fruit. Peach ice-cream may 
be made in the same way. 

Italian-Cream.- -Put one ounce of soaked isinglass, six 
ounces of loaf-sugar, half a stick of vanilla, and one pint of 
milk into a saucepan ; boil slowly ; and stir all the time until 
the isinglass is dissolved ; strain the mixture, and when a little 
cool mix it with a pint of thick cream. Beat thoroughly until 
it thickens. Pour into a large or individual moulds, and put 
in ice-box until wanted. 

To Make Barley-Sugar. — To every pound of sugar allow 
one-half pint of water, one-half the white of an egg. Put the 
sugar into a well-tinned saucepan, with the water, and when 
the former is dissolved, set it over a moderate fire, adding the 
well-beaten egg before the mixture gets warm, and stir it well 
together. When it boils, remove the scum as it rises, and 
keep it boiling until no more appears, and the syrup looks per- 
fectly clear ; then strain it through a fine sieve or muslin bag, 
and put it back into the saucepan. Boil it again like caramel, 
until it is brittle when a little is dropped in a basin of cold 
vv^ater ; it is then sufficiently boiled. Add a little lemon juice 
and a few drops of the essence of lemon, and let it stand for a 
minute or two. Have ready a marble slab or a large dish 
rubbed over with salad oil, pour the sugar on it, and cut it into 



— 159 — 

strips with a pair of scissors ; these strips should then be 
twisted, and the barley-sugar stored away in a very dry place. 
It may be formed into lozenges or drops, by dropping tlie sugar 
in a very small quantity at a time on to the oiled slab or dish. 

To Make Everton Toffee. — One pound of powdered loaf- 
sugar, one teacupful of water, one-quarter pound of butter, six 
drops of essence of lemon. Put the water and sugar into a 
brass pan, and beat the butter to a cream, "When the sugar 
is dissolved, add the butter, and keep stirring the mixture over 
the fire until it sets when a little is poured on to a buttered 
dish ; and just before the toffee is done add the essence of 
lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, and when 
cool it will easily separate from the dish. Butter-scotch, an 
excellent thing for coughs, is made with brown, instead of 
white sugar, omitting the water, and flavored with one-half 
ounce of ginger. It is made in the same manner as toffee. 

Cocoanut Drops. — To one grated cocoanut add half its weight 
of sugar, and the white of one eg^ cut to a stiff froth ; mix 
thoroughly and drop on buttered white paper or tin sheets.^ 
Bake fifteen minutes. 

Molasses Candy. —One cup of molasses, two cups of sugar, 
one tablespoon vinegar, a little butter and vanilla ; boil ten 
minutes, then cool it enough to pull. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cups of brown sugar, one cup 
of molasses, one cup chocolate grated fine, one cup of boiled 
milk, one tablespoon of flour ; butter the size of a large Eng- 
lish walnut ; let it boil slowly and pour on flat tins to cool ; 
mark off while warm. 

Lemon Candy. — Put into a kettle three and one-half pounds 
of sugar, one and one-half pints of water, and one teaspoon of 
cream of tartar. Let it boil until it becomes brittle when 
dropped in cold water ; when sufficiently done take off the fire 
and pour in a shallow dish, which has been greased with a lit- 
tle butter. When this has cooled so that it can be handled, 
add a teaspoon of tartaric acid and the same quantity of ex- 
tract of lemon, and work them into the mass. The acid must 
be fine and free from lumps. Work this in until evenly dis- 
tributed, and no more, as it will tend to destroy the transpar- 
ency of the candy. This method may be used for preparing 
all other candies, as pineapple, etc, using different flavors. 



DRINKS. 

To Make Green Tea. — Have ready a kettle of water boil- 
ing fast, pour some into the teapot, let it remain for a few 
minutes, then throw it out; measure a teaspoonful of tea for 
each two persons, put it in the pot, pour on it about a gill of 
boiling water, cover it close for five minutes, then fill it up; 
have a covered pitcher of boiling water with it; when two 
cups are poured from it fill it up; you will thus keep the 
strength good and equal. If the company is large, it is best 
to have some of the tea drawn in the covered pitcher, and re- 
plenish the teapot or urn when it is exhausted. 

To Make Black Tea. — Make as directed for green tea. 

Iced Tea. — Prepare tea in the morning, making it stronger 
and sweeter than usual; strain and pour into a clean stone 
jug or glass bottle, and set aside in the ice-chest until ready 
to use. Drink from goblets without cream. Serve ice broken 
in small pieces on a platter nicely garnished with well-washed 
grape-leaves. Iced tea may be prepared from either green or 
black alone, but it is considered an improvement to mix tlie 
two. Tea made like that for iced tea (or that left in the tea- 
pot after a meal), with sugar to taste, a slice or two of lemon, 
a little of the juice, and some pieces of cracked ice, makes a 
delightful drink. Serve in glasses. 

To Make Coffee, — Take a good-sized cupful of ground cof- 
fee, and pour into a quart of boiling water, with the white of 
an egg and the crushed shell. Stir well together, adding a 
half cupful of cold water to clear. Put into the coffee-boiler, 
and boil for about a quarter of an hour; after standing for a 
little to settle pour into your coffee-pot, which should be well- 
scalded, and send to the table. The coffee should be stirred 
as it boils. To make coffee au lait, take a pint each of hot 
made coffee and boiling milk; strain through thin muslin into 
coffee-pot, to get rid of the grounds, and serve hot. 

Chocolate. — Take six tablespoonfuls scraped chocolate, or 
three of chocolate and three of cocoa, dissolve in a quart of

boiling water, boil hard fifteen minutes, add one quart of rich 
milk, let scald and serve hot; this is enough for six persons. 
Cocoa can also be made after this recipe. Some boil either 
cocoa or chocolate only one minute and then serve, while 
others make it the day before using, boiling it for one hour, 
and when cool skimming off the oil, and when wanted for use, 
heat it to the boiling point and add the milk. In this way it 
is equally good and much more wholesome. Cocoa is from 
the seed of the fruit of a small tropical tree. There are seve- 
ral forms in which it is sold; the most nutritious and conven- 
ient being chocolate, the next cocoa, then cocoa nibs, and last 
cocoa shells. The ground bean is simply cocoa; ground fine 
and mixed with sugar it is chocolate; the beans broken into 
bits are "nibs." The shells are the shells of the bean, 
usually removed before grinding. The beans are roasted 
like coffee, and ground between hot rollers. 

Lemon Syrup— Take the juice of twelve lemons, grate 
the rind of six in it, let it stand over night, then take six 
pounds of white sugar, and make a thick syrup. When it 
is quite cool, strain the juice into it, and squeeze as much 
oil from the grated rind as will suit the taste. A tablespoon: 
ful in a goblet of water will make a delicious drink on a hot 
day, far superior to that prepared from the stuff commonly 
sold as lemon syrup. 

Strawberry Syrup.— Take fine ripe strawberries, crush them 
in a cloth, and press the juice from them; to each pint of it 
put a pint of simple syrup, boil gently for one hour, then let 
it become cold, and bottle it; cork and seal it. When served, 
reduce it to taste with water, set it on ice, and serve in small 
tumblers half filled. 

P aspberry Syrup.— Make as directed for strawberry. 

Strawberry Sherbet— Take fourteen ounces of picked straw- 
berries, crush them in a mortar, then add to them a quart of 
water; pour this into a basin, with a lemon sliced, and a tea- 
spoonful of orange-flower water; let it remain for two or three 
hours. Put eighteen ounces of sugar into another basin, cover 
it with a cloth, through which pour the strawberry juice, after 
as much has run through as will; gather up the cloth, and 
squeeze out as much juice as possible from it; when the sugar 



— 162 — 

is all dissolved, strain it again; set the vessel containing it on 
ice, until ready to serve. ' -^m*'' • 

Raspberry Vinegar.— To four quarts red raspberries, put 
enough vinegar to cover, and let them stand twenty-four 
hours; scald and strain it; add a pound of sugar to one pint of 
juice; boil it twenty minutes, and bottle; it is then ready for 
use and will keep years. To one glass of water add a great 
spoonful. It is much relished by the sick. Very nice. 

Lemonade — Take half a pound of loaf sugar and reduce it 
to a syrup with one pint of water; add the rind of five lemons 
and let stand an hour; remove the rinds and add the strained 
juice of the lemons; add one bottle of '• ApoUinaris " water, 
and a block of ice in centre of bowl. Peel one lemon and cut 
it up into thin slices, divide each slice in two, and put in lem- 
onade. Claret or fine cordials may be added if desired. Serve 
with a piece of lemon in each glass. 

Egg Nogg. — Whip the whites and yolks of six eggs into a 
stiff cream, adding a half cupful of sugar. Pour into a quart 
of rich milk, adding a half pint of good brandy, and a little 
flavoring of nutmeg. Stir up and thoroughly mix the ingre- 
dients, and add the whites of three additional eggs well 
whipped. 

Raisin Wine. — Take two pounds of raisins, seed and chop 
them, a lemon, a pound of white sugar, and about two gallons 
of boiling water. Pour into a stone jar, and stir daily for six 
or eight days. Strain, bottle, and put in a cool place for ten 
days or so, when the wine will be ready for use. 

Currant Wine. — The currants should be quite ripe. Stem, 
mash, and strain them, adding a half pint of water, and less 
than a pound of sugar, to a quart of the mashed fruit. Stir 
well up together and pour into a clean cask, leaving the bung- 
hole open, or covered with a piece of lace. It should stand for 
a month to ferment, when it will be ready for bottling. 

Ginger Wine. - One-half pound of cinnamon bark, four 
ounces of pimento, two ounces of mace, three-quarters of an 
ounce of capsicum, three-quarters of a pound of ginger root, 
five gallons of alcohol ; macerate and strain or filter, after 
standing fifteen days. Now make syrup, thirty pounds of 
white sugar, half pound of tartaric acid, one and a half pounds 
of cream tartar, dissolve with warm water, clarify with whites 



— 1G3 — 

of two eggs, and add soft water to make forty gallons. Color 
with cochineal and let it stand six months before use. 

Fine Milk Punch. — Pare off the yellow rind of four large 
lemons, and steep it for twenty-four hours in a quart of brandy 
or rum. Then mix with it the juice of the lemons, a pound 
and a half of loaf-sugar ; two grated nutmegs, and a quart of 
water. Add a quart of rich unskimmed milk, made boiling 
hot, and strain the whole through a jelly-bag. You may either 
use it as soon as it is cold, or make a larger quantity (in the 
above proportions), and bottle it. It will keep several months. 

Claret Cup. — One quart bottle of claret, one bottle of soda 
water, one lemon cut very thin, four tablespoons of powdered 
sugar, quarter of a teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one liquor 
glass of brandy, one wine 4 lass of sherry wine. Half an hour 
before it is to be used, put in a large piece of ice, so that it may 
get perfectly cold. 

Roman Punch. — Grate the yellow rinds of four lemons and 
two oranges upon two pounds of loaf-sugar. Squeeze on the' 
juice of the lemons and oranges; cover it, and let it stand till 
next day. Then strain it through a sieve, add a bottle of 
champagne, and the whites of eight eggs beaten to froth. 
You may freeze it or not. 

Cream Nectar. — Dissolve two pounds of crushed sugar, in 
three quarts of water ; boil down to two quarts ; drop in the 
white of an egg wliile boiling; then strain, and put in the tar- 
taric acid; when cold drop in the lemon to your taste ; then 
bottle and cork. Sliake two or three times a day. 

Red Currant Cordial. — To two quarts of red currants put 
one quart of whiskey; let it stand twenty-four hours, then 
bruise and strain through a flannel bag. To every two quarts 
of this liquor, add one pound of loaf-sugar, add quarter of a 
pound of ginger well bruised and boiled; let the whole stand 
to settle, then strain or filter; bottle and cork, seal the corks 
tightly. It is an improvement to have half red raspberry juice 
if the flavor is liked. The above is fit for use in a month. 

Elderberry Syrup. — Take elderberries perfectly ripe, wash 
and strain them, put a pint of molasses to a pint of the juice, 
boil it twenty minutes, stirring constantly, when cold add to 
eacli quart a pint of French brandy; bottle and cork it tight. 
It is an excellent remedy for a cough. 



INVAIvIO COOKERY. 

Port Wine Jelly.— Melt in a little warm water an ounce of 
isinglass; stir it into a pint of port wine, adding two ounces 
of sugar candy, an ounce of gum arabic, and half a nutmeg, 
grated. Mix all well and boil it ten minutes ; or till every- 
thing is thoroughly dissolved. Then strain it through muslin 
and set it away to get cold. 

Tapioca Jelly. — Wash the tapioca carefully in two or three 
waters, then soak it for five or six hours, simmer it then in a 
stewpan until it becomes quite clear, add a little of the juice 
of a lemon, wine if desired. 

Arrowroot Wine Jelly. — One cup boiling v;ater, two heap- 
ing teaspoons arrowroot, two heaping teaspoons white sugar, 
one tablespoonful brandy or three tablespoonfuls of wine. 
An excellent corrective to weak bowels. 

Jellied Chicken. — Cook six chickens in a small quantity of 
water, until the meat will part from the bones easily ; season 
to taste with salt and pepper ; just as soon as cold enough to 
handle, remove bones and skin ; place meat in a deep pan or 
mould, just as it comes from the bone, using gizzard, liver and 
heart, until the mould is nearly full. To the water left in the 
kettle, add three-fourths of a box of Cox's gelatine (some add 
juice of lemon), dissolved in a little warm water, and boil until 
it is reduced to a little less than a quart, pour over the chicken 
in the mould, leave to cool, cut with a very sharp knife and 
serve. The slices will not easily break up if directions are 
followed. 

Chicken Broth. — Half fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole 
one, one quart of water, one blade of mace, half onion, a small 
bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, ten peppercorns. If a 
young one be used for this broth, the inferior joints may be 
put in the broth, and the best pieces reserved for dressing in 
some other manner. Put the fowl into a saucepan, with all 
the ingredients, and simmer gently for one and a half hours, 



— 165 — 

carefully skimming- the broth well. When done, strain, and 
put by in a cool place until wanted ; then take all the fat off 
the top, warm up as much as may be required, and serve. 
This broth is, of course, only for those invalids whose stom- 
achs are strong enough to digest it, with a flavoring of herbs, 
etc. It may be made in the same manner as beef tea, with 
water and salt only ; but the preparation will be but tasteless 
and insipid. When the invalid cannot" digest this chicken 
broth with the flavoring, we would recommend plain beef tea 
in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be, with- 
out the addition of herbs, onions, etc. 

To Make Gruel. — One tablespoonful of Robinson's patent 
groats, two tablespoonfuls of cold water, one pint of boiling 
water. Mix the prepared groats smoothly -with the cold water 
in a basin ; pour over them the boiling water, stirring it all the 
time. Put it into a very clean saucepan ; boil the gruel for 
ten minutes, keeping it well stirred ; sweeten to taste, and 
serve. It may be flavored with a small piece of lemon-peel, 
by boiling it in the gruel, or a little grated nutmeg maybe put 
in ; but in these matters the taste of the patient should be 
consulted. Pour the gruel in a tumbler, and serve. When 
wine is allowed to the invalid, two tablespoonfuls of sherry or 
port make this preparation very nice. In cases of colds, the 
same quantity of spirits is sometimes, added instead of wine. 

Barley Water. — Put a large tablespoonful of well-washed 
pearl barley into a pitcher ; pour over it boiling water ; cover 
it, and let it remain till cold; then drain off the water; sweeten 
to taste, and, if liked, add the juice of a lemon, and grated nut- 
meg. 

Arrowroot Blanc-Mange. — Put a quart of milk to boil, take 
an ounce of Bermuda arrowroot, ground fine, make it a. 
smooth batter with cold milk, add a teaspoonful of salt; when 
the milk is boiling hot, stir the batter into it, continue to stir 
it over a gentle fire (that it may not be scorched), for three or 
four minutes; sweeten to taste with double refined sugar, and 
flavor with lemon extract or orange-flower water, or boil a 
stick of cinnamon or vanilla bean in the milk before putting 
in the arrowroot ; dip a mould into cold water, strain the 
bl an c-mange through a muslin into the mould, when perfectly 
cold, turn it out; serve currant jelly or jam with it.

— 166 — 

Lemonade for Invalids. — One-half a lemon, lump sugar to 
taste, one pint of boiling water. Pare off the rind of the 
lemon thinly; cut the lemon into two or three thick slices, 
and remove as much as possible of the white outside pith, and 
all the pips. Put the slices of lemon, the peel and lump sugar, 
into a jug ; pour over the boiling water ; cover it closely, and 
in two hours it will be fit to drink. It should either be strained, 
or poured off, from the sediment. 

Mutton Broth. — Is frequently ordered as a preparation for 
invalids. For the sick room, such broth must be made as 
plainly as possible, and so as to secure the juice of the meat. 
Boil slowly a couple of pounds of lean mutton for two hours, 
skim it very carefully as it simmers, and do not put in very 
much salt. If the doctor permits, some vegetable, as season- 
ing, may be added, and for some broths a little fine barley or 
rice is added. 

Flaxseed Lemonade. — Four tablespoonfuls of flaxseed 
(whole), one quart boiling water poured on the flaxseed, juice 
of two lemons, leaving out the peel. Sweeten to taste ; steep 
three hours in a covered pitcher. If too thick, put in cold 
water with the lemon juice and sugar. Ice, for drinking. It 
is splendid for colds. 

Arrowroot. — This is very nourishing and light, either for 
invalids or infants ; make it with milk or water ; put a pint 
of either into a stewpan, make it boiling hot, add a saltspoon 
of salt, put a heaped teaspoonful of ground Bermuda arrow- 
root into a cup, make it smooth with cold milk, stir it into the 
stewpan, and let it simmer for two or three minutes ; then 
turn it into a bowl, sweeten, and grate nutmeg over, if liked ; 
should it be preferred thin, use less arrowroot. This should 
be made only as much as is wanted at a time, since it will be- 
come as thin as water if heated over. 

Stewed Rabbits in Milk. — Two very young rabbits, not 
nearly half grown ; one and one-half pints of milk, one blade 
of mace, one dessert spoonful of flour, a little salt and cay- 
enne. Mix the flour very smoothly with four tablespoonfuls 
of the milk, and when this is well mixed, add the remainder. 
Cut up the rabbits into joints, put them into a stewpan with 
the milk and other ingredients, and simmer them ver^y gently 
until quite tender. Stir the contents from time to time, to 



— 167 — 

keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning. Half an 
hour will be sufficient for the cooking of this dish. 

Slippery-Elm Bark Tea.— Break the bark into bits, pour 
boiling water over it, cover, and let it infuse until cold. 
Sweeten, ice, and take for summer disorders, or add lemon 
juice, and drink for a bad cold. 

Beef Tea. — One pound lean beef, cut into small pieces. 
Put into a jar, without a drop of water; cover tightly, and set 
in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue 
this steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like white 
rags, and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to taste, 
and when cold, skim. 

Egg Wine. — One egg, one tablespoonful and one half glass of 
cold water, one glass of sherry, sugar, and grated nutmeg to 
taste. Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold 
water ; make the wine and water hot, but not boiling ; pour 
it on the egg, stirring all the time. Add sufficient lump sugar 
to sweeten the mixture, and a little grated nutmeg ; put all 
into a very clean saucepan, set it on a gentle fire, and stir the 
contents one way until they thicken, but do not allow them to 
boil. Serve in a glass, with sippets of toasted bread or plain 
crisp biscuits. When the egg is not warmed, the mixture will 
be found easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink. 

Toast Water. — Slices of toast, nicely browned, without a 
symptom of burning. Enough boiling water to cover them. 
Cover closely, and let them steep until cold. Strain the water, 
sweeten to taste, and put a piece of ice in each glassful. 

Onion Gruel, — Is excellent for a cold. Slice down a few 
onions, and boil them in a pint of new milk; stir in a sprinkle 
of oatmeal and a very little salt, boil till the onions are quite 
tender, then sup rapidly, and go to bed. 




COSMKXIOUES. 

Complexion Wash. — Put in a vial one drachm of benzoin 
gum in powder, one drachm nutmeg oil, six drops of orange- 
blossom tea, or apple blossoms put in half pint rain watei-. 
and boiled down to one teaspoonful and strained^ one pint of 
sherry wine. Bathe the face morning and night ; will re- 
move all flesh worms and freckles, and give a beautiful com- 
plexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum of benzoin in 
pint of whiskey; to use, put in water in washbowl till it is 
milky, allowing it to dry without wiping. This is perfectly 
harmless. 

To Clear a Tanned Skin, — Wash with a solution of car- 
bonate of soda and a little lemon juice ; then with Fuller's 
earth water, or the juice of unripe grapes. 

Oil to Make the Hair Curl. — Olive oil, one pound ; oil of 
organum, one drachm ; oil of rosemary, one and one-half 
drachms. Mix. 

Wrinkles in the Skin. — White wax, one ounce ; strained 
honey, two ounces ; juice of lily bulbs, two ounces. The fore- 
going melted and stirred together will remove wrinkles. 

Pearl Water for the Face. — Put a half pound of best 
Windsor soap scraped fine into a half a gallon of boiling 
water ; stir it well until it cools : add a pint of spirits of wine 
and half an ounce of oil of rosemary ; stir well. This is a good 
cosmetique, and will remove freckles. 

Pearl Dentifrice. — Prepared chalk, one-half pound ; pow- 
dered myrrh, two ounces : camphor, two drachms ; orris root 
powdered, two ounces. Moisten the camplior witli alcohol 
and mix all well together. 

Wash for a Blotched Face.— Rose water, three ounces ; sul- 
phate of zinc, one drachm ; mix. Wet the face with it, gently 
dry it and then touch it over with cold cream, which also gen- 
tly dry off. 

Face Powder. — Take of wheat starch one pound ; powdered 
orris root, three ounces ; oil of lemon, thirty drops ; oil of ber- 



— 1G9 — 

gamot, oil of cloves, each fifteen drops. Rub thoroughly to- 
gether. 

A Good Wash for the Hair. — One pennyworth of borax, 
half a pint of olive oil, one pint of boiling water. 

Mode : Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil ; let it 
cool ; then put the mixture into a bottle. Shake it before using, 
and apply it with a flannel. Camphor and borax, dissolved 
in boiling water and left to cool, make a very good wash for 
the hair ; as also does rosemary water mixed with a little 
borax. After using any of these washes, when the hair be- 
comes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed 
in, to make it smooth and glossy. 



MISCEIvIvANEOUS. 

An Excellent Hard Soap.— Pour twelve quarts soft boiling 
water on two and one-half pounds of unslacked lime; dissolve 
five pounds sal soda in twelve quarts soft hot water ; then mix 
and let them remain from twelve to twenty-four hours. Pour 
off all the clear fluid, being careful not to allow any of the 
sediment to run off ; boil three and one-half pounds clean 
grease and three or four ounces of rosin in the above lye till 
the grease disappears ; pour into a box and let it stand a day 
to stiffen and then cut in bars. It is as well to put the lime in 
all the water and then add the soda. After pouring off the 
fluid, add two or three gallons of Avater and let it stand with 
the lime and soda dregs a day or two. This makes an excel- 
lent washing fluid to boil or soak the clothes in, with one pint 
in a boiler of water. 

To Wash Woolen Blankets. — Dissolve soap enough to make 
a good suds in boiling water, add a tablespoon of aqua am- 
monia ; when scalding hot, turn over your blankets. If con- 
venient, use a pounder, or any way to work thoroughly through 
the suds without rubbing on a board. Rinse well in hot water. 
There is usually soap enough from the first suds to make the 
second soft ; if. not, add a little soap and ammonia ; and after 
being put through the wringer let two persons, standing op- 



— 170 — 

posite, pull them into shape ; dry in the sun. White flannels 
may be washed in the same way without shrinking. Calicoes 
and other colored fabrics can, before washing, be advan- 
tageously soaked for a time in a pail of water to which a 
spoonful of ox gall has been added. It helps keep the color. 
A teacup of lye to a pail of water will improve the color of 
black goods when necessary to wash them, and vinegar in the 
rinsing water of pink or green will brighten those colors, as 
will soda for purple and blue. 

For Clothes that Fade. — One ounce sugar of lead in a 
pail of rain water. Soak over night. 

Lamp- Wicks. — To insure a good light, wicks must be 
changed often as they soon become clogged, and do not per- 
mit the free passage of the oil. Soaking wicks in vinegar 
twenty-four hours before placing in lamp insures a clear 
flame. 

To Make Old Crape Look Nearly Equal to New.— Place 
a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there is plenty 
of steam from the spout ; then, holding the crape in both 
hands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and 
it will be clean and look nearly equal to new. 

To Clean Kid Gloves.— Rub with very slightly damp 
bread-crumbs. If not effectual, scrape upon them dry fuller's 
earth or French chalk, when on the hands, and rub them 
quickly together in all directions. Do this several times. Or 
put gloves of a light color on the hands and wash the hands 
in a basin of spirits of hartshorn. Some gloves may be washed 
in a strong lather made of spft soap and warm water or milk ; 
or wash with rice pulp ; or sponge them well with turpentine, 
and hang them in a warm place or where there is a current 
of air, and all smell of turpentine will be removed. 

Stains and Spots.— Children's clothes, table linens, towels, 
etc., should be tlioroughly examined before wetting, as soap- 
suds, washing-fluids, etc., will fix almost any stain past re- 
moval. Many stains will pass away by being simply washed 
in pure soft water ; or alcohol will remove, before the article 
has been in soapsuds, many stains. Ironmold, mildew, or al- 
most any similar spot, can be taken out by dipping in diluted 
citric acid ; then cover with salt, and lay in the bright sun till 
the stain disappears. If of long standing, it may be necessary 



— in- 
to repeat the wetting and the sunlight. Be careful to rinse in 
several waters as soon as the stain is no longer visible. Ink, 
fruit, wine, and mildew stains must first be washed in clear, 
cold water, removing as much of the spots as can be ; then 
mix one teaspoonful of oxalic acid and half a pint of rain 
water. Dip the stain in this, and wipe off in clear water. 
Wash at once, if a fabric that will bear washing. A table- 
spoonful of white currant juice, if any can be had, is even bet- 
ter than lemon. This preparation may be used on the most 
delicate articles without injury. Shake it up before using it, 
and be careful and put out of the reach of meddlers or little 
folks, as it is poisonous. 

To Remove Grease Spots. — An excellent mixture to re- 
move grease spots from boys' and men's clothing particularly, 
is made of four parts alcohol to one part of ammonia and 
about half as much ether as ammonia. Apply the liquid to 
the grease spot, and then rub diligently with a sponge and 
clear water. The chemistry of the operation seems to be that 
the alcohol and ether dissolve the grease, and the ammonia 
forms a soap with it which is Avashed out with the water. 
The result is much more satisfactory than when something is 
used which only seems to spread the spot and make it fainter, 
but does not actually remove it. If oil is spilt on a carpet and 
you immediately scatter cornmeal over it, the oil will be ab- 
sorbed by it. Oil may also be removed from carpets on which 
you do not dare put ether and ammonia by laying thick blot- 
ting paper over it and pressing a hot fiat-iron on it. Repeat 
the operation several times, using a clean paper each time. 

Stains on Marble. — Iron-rust stains on marble can usually 
be removed by rubbing with lemon juice. Almost all other 
stains may be taken off by mixing one ounce of finely pow- 
dered chalk, one of pumice-stone, and two ounces of common 
soda. Sift these together through a fine sieve, and mix with 
water. When thoroughly mixed, rub this mixture over the 
stains faithfully, and the stains will disappear. Wash the 
marble after this with soap and water, dry and polish with a 
chamois skin, and the marble will look like new. 



To keep starch from sticking to irons rub the irons with a 
little piece of wax or sperm. 



— 172 — 

Paint or Varnish. — ^Oilof turpentine or benzine will remove 
spots of paint, varnish, or pitch from white or colored cotton 
or Avoolen goods. After using it they should be washed in 
soapsuds. 

To Remove Ink from Carpets. — When freshly spilled, ink 
can be removed from carpets by wetting in milk. Take cotton 
batting and soak up all of the ink that it will receive, being 
careful not to let it spread. Then take fresh cotton, wet in 
milk, and sop it up carefully. Repeat this operation, cliang- 
ing cotton and milk each time. After most of the ink has been 
taken up in this way, with fresh cotton and clean, rub the 
spot. Continue till all disappears; then wash the spot in clean 
warm water and a little soap ; rinse in clear water, and rub till 
nearly dry. If the ink is dried in, we know of no way that 
will not take the color from the carpet as well as the ink, un- 
less the ink is on a white spot. In that case salts of lemon, 
or soft soap, starch, and lemon juice will remove the ink as 
easily as if on cotton. * • 

To Remove Ink from Paper. — Put one pound of chloride 
of lime to four quarts of water. Shake well together and let 
it stand twenty-four hours ; then strain through a clean cot- 
ton cloth. Add one teaspoonf ul of acetic acid to an ounce of 
this prepared lime water, and apply to the blot, and the ink 
will disappear. Absorb the moisture with blotting-paper. 
The remainder may be bottled, closely corked, and set aside 
for future use. 

Ink on Rosewood or Mahogany. — If ink has been unfor- 
tunately spilled on mahogany, rosewood, or black walnut 
furniture, put half a dozen drops of spirits of nitre into a 
spoonful of water, and touch the stain with a feather wet in 
this ; as soon as the ink disappears, rub the place immediately 
with a cloth ready wet in cold water, or the nitre will leave a 
white spot very difficult to remove. If after washing off the 
nitre the ink spot still lingers, make the mixture a little 
stronger and use the second time, and never forget to wash it 
off at once. 



A thin coating of three parts lard melted with one part rosin 
applied to stoves and grates will prevent their rusting in 
summer. 



— 173 — 

Coal Fire. — If your coal fire is low, throw on a tablespoon 
of salt and it will help it very much. 

Polish for Bright Stoves and Steel Articles. — One table- 
spoonful of turpentine ; one tablespoonful of sweet oil; emery 
powder. Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together, stirring 
in sufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thick- 
ness of cream. Put it on the article with a piece of soft flan- 
nel, rub off quickl}' with another piece, then polish with a 
little emery powder and clean leather. 

To Keep off Mosquitoes. — Rub exposed parts with kerosene. 
The odor is not noticed after a few minutes, and children es- 
pecially are much relieved by its use. 

To Brighten Gilt Frames. — Take sufficient flour of sulphur 
to give a golden tinge to about one and one-half pint of water, 
and in this boil four or five bruised onions, or garlic, which 
will answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with 
it, when cold, wash, with a soft brush, any gilding which re- 
quires restoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as 
new work. 

To Preserve Steel Pens. — Steel pens are destroyed by cor- 
rosion from acid in the ink. Put in the ink some nails or old 
steel pens, and the acid will exhaust itself on them, and the 
pens in use will not corr.ode. 

To Clean Combs. — If it can be avoided, never wash combs, 
as the water often makes the teeth split, and the tortoise shell 
or horn of which they are made, rough. Small brushes, man- 
ufactured purposely for cleaning combs, may be purchased at 
a trifling cost; with this the comb should be well brushed, and 
afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel. 

For Cleaning Ink-Spots. — Ink-spots on the fingers may be 
instantly removed by a little ammonia. Rinse the hands, after 
washing, in clear water. A little ammonia in a few spoonfuls 
of alcohol is excellent to sponge silk dresses that have grown 
''shiny" or rusty, as well as to take out spots. A silk, partic- 
ularly a black, becomes almost like new when so sponged. 



An occasional feed of hard-boiled eggs made fine and mixed 
with cracker crumbs is good for canary birds. Feed a couple 
of thimblefuls at a time. 



— 174 — 

Mice. — Pumpkin seeds are very attractive to mice, and traps 
baited with them will soon destroy this little pest. 

Camphor. — Placed in trunks or drawers will prevent mice 
from doing them injury. 

For Cleaning Jewelry. — For cleaning jewelry there is noth- 
ing better than ammonia and water. If very dull or dirty, 
rub a little soap on a soft brush and brush them in this wash, 
rinse in cold water, dry first in an old handkerchief, and then 
rub with buck or chamois skin. Their freshness and brilliancy 
when thus cleaned cannot be surpassed by any compound 
used by jewelers. 

For Washing Silver and Silverware. — For washing silver, 
put half a teaspoonful ammonia into the suds; have the water 
hot; wash quickly, using a small brush, rinse in hot water, 
and dry with a clean linen towel; then rub very dry with a 
chamois skin. Washed in this manner, silver becomes very 
brilliant, requires no polishing with any of the powders or 
whiting usually employed, and does not wear out. Silver- 
plate, jewelry, and door-plates can be beautifully cleaned and 
made to look like new by dropping a soft cloth or chamois 
skin in a weak preparation of ammonia water, and rubbing 
the articles with it. Put half a teaspoonful into clear water 
to wash tumblers or glass of any kind, rinse and dry well, and 
they will be beautifully clear. 

For Washing Glass and Glassware. — For washing win- 
dows, looking-glasses, etc., a little ammonia in the water saves 
much labor, aside from giving a better polish than anything 
else; and for general house-cleaning it removes dirt, smoke 
and grease, most effectually. 

Insects and Vermin. — Dissolve two pounds of afum in three 
or four quarts of water. Let it remain over night, till all the 
alum is dissolved. Then, with a brush, apply, boiling hot, to 
every joint or crevice in the closet or shelves where Croton 
bugs, ant^J, cockroaches, etc., intrude; also to the joints and 
crevices of bedsteads, as bedbugs dislike it as much as Croton 
bugs, roaches, or ants. Brush all the cracks in the floor and 
mop-boards. Keep it boiling hot while using. 

To keep woolens and furs from moths, two things are to be 
observed— first, to see that none are in the articles when they 
are put away, and second, to put them where the parent moth 



— 175 — 

cannot enter. Tin cases, soldered tight, whiskey barrels headed 
so that not even a liquid can get in or out, have been used to 
keep out moths. A piece of strong brown paper, with not a 
hole through which even a large pin can enter, is just as good. 
Put the articles in a close box and cover every joint with pa- 
per, or resort to whatever will be a complete covering. A 
wrapper of common cotton cloth, so put around and secured, 
is often used. Wherever a knitting needle will pass the parent 
moth can enter. Carefully exclude the insect and the articles 
will be safe. 

Moths in Carpets. — Persons troubled with carpet moths 
may get rid of them by scrubbing the floor with strong hot 
salt and water before laying the carpet, and sprinkling the 
carpet with salt once a week before sweeping. 

Smooth Sad-irons. — To have your sad-irons clean and 
smooth rub them first with a piece of wax tied in a cloth, and 
afterward scour them on a paper on thick cloth strewn with 
coarse salt. 

To Cleanse the Inside of Jars. — This can be done in a few 
minutes by filling up the jars with hot water (it need not be 
scalding hot), and then stirring in a teaspoonful or more of 
baking soda. Shake well, then empty the jar at once, and if 
any of the former odor remains about it, fill again with water 
and soda; shake well, and rinse out in cold water. 

Furniture Polish. — Equal proportions of linseed oil, turpen- 
tine, vinegar, and spirits of wine. 

Mode : When used, shake the mixture well, and rub on the 
furniture with a piece of linen rag, and polish witli a clean 
duster. Vinegar and oil, rubbed in with flannel, and the fur- 
niture rubbed with a clean duster, produce a very good 
polish. 

Squeaking doors ought to have the hinges oiled by a feather 
dipped in some linseed oil. 



A soft cloth, wetted in alcohol, is excellent to wipe off French 
plate-glass and mirrors. 

A red-hot iron will soften old putty so that it can be easily 
removed. 



— 17G — 

To Sweeten Meat. — A little charcoal thrown into the pot 
will sweeten meat that is a little old-. Not if it is anyway 
tainted — it is then not fit to eat— but only if kept a little longer 
than makes it quite fresh. 

Stove Polish. — Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine 
and applied in the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy, and 
more durable than when mixed with any other liquid. The 
turpentine prevents rust, and when put on an old rusty stove 
will make it look as well as new. 

Cleaning White Paint. — Spirits of ammonia, used in suflfi- 
cient quantity to soften the water and ordinary hard soap, 
will make the paint look white and clean with half the effort 
of any other method I ever have tried. Care should be 
taken not to have too much ammonia, or the paint will be 
injured. 

To Remove Stains from Mattresses. — Make thick paste 
by wetting starch with cold water. Spread this on the stain, 
first putting the mattress in the sun ; rub this off after an 
hour or so, and if the ticking is not clean try the process 
again. 

How to Clean Corsets. — Take out the steels at front and 
sides, then scrub thoroughly with tepid or cold lather of white 
castile soap, using a very small scrubbing brush. Do not lay 
them in water. When quite clean let cold water run on them 
freely from the spigot to rinse out the soap thoroughly. Dry 
without ironing (after pulling lengthwise until they are 
straight and shapely), in a cool place 

To Cleaa Hairbrushes. — Do not use soap, but put a table- 
spoon of hart'^horn into the water, having it only tepid, and 
dip up and down until clean ; then dry with the brushes down, 
and they will be like new ones. If you do not have ammonia, 
use soda ; a teaspoonful dissolved in the water will do very

How to Wash Flannels —There are many conflicting 
theories in regard to the proper way to wash flannels, but I 
am convinced, from careful observation, that the true way is 
to wash them in water in which you can comfortably bear 
your hand. Make suds before putting the flannels in, and do 
not rub soap on t]ie flannel. I make it a rule to have only one 
piece of flannel put in the tub at a time. Wash in two suds if 



— 177 — 

inuch soiled ; tKeii rinse thoroughly in clean, weak suds, 
wring, and hang up ; but do not take flannels out of warm 
water and hang out in a freezing air, as that certainly tends to 
shrink them. It is better to dry them in the house, unless the 
sun shines. In washing worsted goods, such as men's panta- 
loons, pursue the same course, only do not wring them, but 
hang them up and let them drain ; while a little damp bring 
in and press smoothly with as hot an iron as you can use with- 
out scorching the goods. The reason for not wringing them is 
to prevent wrinkles. 

Cleaning Lace. — Cream-colored Spanish lace can be cleaned 
and made to look like new by rubbing it in dry flour ; rub as 
if you were washing in water. Then take it outdoors and 
shake all the flour out ; if not perfectly clean, repeat the rub- 
bing in a little more clean flour. The flour must be very thor- 
oughly shaken from the lace, or the result will be far from sat- 
isfactory. White knitted hoods can be cleaned in this way ; 
babies' socks also, if only slightly soiled. 

New Kettles. — The best way to prepare a new iron kettle 
for use is to fill it with clean potato peelings, boil them for an 
hour or more, then wash the kettle with hot water ; wipe it 
dry, and rub it with a little lard ; repeat the rubbing for half a 
dozen times after using. In this way you will prevent rust and 
all the annoyances liable to occur in the use of a new kettle. 

To Keep Flies off Gilt Frames. — Boil three or four onions 
in a pint of water and apply with a soft brush. 

To prevent Knives from Rusting. — In laying aside knives, 
or other steel implements, they should be slightly oiled and 
wrapped in tissue paper to prevent their rusting. A salty at- 
mosphere will, in a short time, ruin all steel articles, unless 
some such precaution is taken. 

Cement for Glassware. — For mending valuable glass ob- 
jects, which would be disfigured by common cement, chrome 
cement may be used. This is a mixture of five parts of gela- 
tine to one of a solution of acid chromate of lime. The broken 
edges are covered with this, pressed together and exposed to 
sunlight, the effect of the latter being to render the compound 
insoluble even in boiling water. 

Waterproof Paper. — Excellent paper for packing may be 
made of old newspapers ; the tougher the paper of course the 



— 178 — 

better. A mixture is made of copal varnish, boiled linseed 
oil and turpentine, in equal parts. If^is painted on the paper; 
with a flat varnish brush an inch and a half wide, and the 
sheets are laid out to dry for a few minutes. This paper lias 
been very successfully used for packing plants for sending 
long distances, and is probably equal to the paper comnxpnly 
used by nurserymen. V' "' ; ., - 

Perspiration. — The unpleasant odor produced by perspira- 
tion is frequently the source of vexation to persons who are 
subject to it. Nothing is simpler than to remove this odor 
much more effectually than by the application of such costly 
unguents and perfumes as are in use. It is only necessary to 
procure some of the compound spirits of ammonia, and place 
about two tablespoonsful in a basin of water. Washing the 
face, hands, and arms with this leaves the skin as clean, 
sweet, and fresh as one could wish. The wash is perfectly 
harmless and very cheap. It is recommended on the author- 
ity of an experienced physician. 

Renewing Old Kid Gloves.— Make a thick mucilage by 
boiling a handful of flaxseed; add a little dissolved toilet soap; 
then, when the mixture cools, put the gloves on the hands and 
rub them with a piece of white flannel wet with the mixture. 
Do not wet the gloves through. 

Cologne Water.— Take a pint of alcohol and put in thirty 
drops of oil of lemon, thirty of bergamot, and half a gill of 
water. If musk or lavender is desired, add the same quantity 
of each. The oils should be put in the alcohol and shaken Avell 
before the water is added. Bottle it for use. 

To Cleanse Sponge.— By rubbing a fresh lemon thoroughly 
into a soured sponge and rinsing it several times in lukewarm 
water, it will become as sweet as when new. 

Icy Windows. — Windows may be kept free from ice and 
polished by rubbing the glass with a sponge dipped in al- 
cohol. 

Blood Stains — To remove blood stains from cloth, saturate 
with kerosene, and after standing a little wash in warm 
water. 

Camphor Ice.— One ounce of lard, one ounce of spermaceti, 
one ounce of camphor, one ounce of almond oil, one-half cake 
of white wax ; melt, and turn into moulds. 



— 179 — 

Starch Polish. — Take one ounce of spermaceti and one ounce 
of white wax ; melt, and run it into a thin cake on a plate. 
A piece the size of a quarter dollar, added to a quart of pre- 
pared starch, gives a beautiful lustre to the clothes, and pre- 
vents the iron from sticking. 

To Clean Feathers. — Cover the feathers vrith a paste made 
of pipe-clay and water, rubbing them one way only. When 
quite dry, shake off all the powder, and curl with a knife. 
Grebe feathers may be washed with white soap in soft water. 

To Test Nutmegs.— To test nutmegs, prick them with a 
pin, and if they are good, the oil will instantly spread around 
the puncture. 

To Clean Mica. — Mica in stoves, when smoked, is readily 
cleaned by taking it out, and thoroughly wasliing with vine- 
gar a little diluted. If the black does not come off at once, 
let it soak a little. 

To Destroy Vermin in the Hair.— Powdered cevadilla one 
ounce, powdered staves-acre, one ounce, powdered panby 
seed, one ounce, powdered tobacco, one ounce. Mix well, and 
rub among the roots of the hair thoroughly. 

To Remove Bruises from Furniture. — Wet the bruised spot 
with warm water. Soak a piece of brown paper, of several 
thicknesses, in warm water, and lay over the place. Then 
apply a warm fiat iron until the moisture is gone. Repeat the 
process if needful, and the bruise will disappear. 

Pearl Smelling Salts. — Powdered carbonate of ammonia, 
one ounce ; strong solution of ammonia, half a fluid ounce ; 
oil of rosemary, ten drops; oil of bergamot, ten drops. Mix, 
and while moist, put in a wide-mouthed bottle, which is to be 
well closed. 

Pounded Glass for Rats.— Pounded glass, mixed with dry 
corn-meal, and placed within the reach of rats, it is said, will 
banish them from the premises ; or, sprinkle cayenne pepper 
in their holes. 

Polish for Boots. — Take of ivory-black and treacle, each 
four ounces ; sulphuric acid, one ounce ; best olive oil, two 
spoonfuls; best white-wine vinegar, three half-pints; mix the 
ivory-black and treacle well in an earthen jar ; then add the 
sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the mixture ; next pour in 



— 180 — 

the oil ; and, lastly, add the vineg"ii.r, stirring it in by degrees, 
until thoroughly incorporated. 

To Clean Plate. — Wash the plate well, to remove all grease, 
in a strong lather of common yellow soap and boiling water, 
and wipe it quite dry ; then mix as much hartshorn powder as 
will be required, into a thick paste, with cold water or spirits 
of wine ; smear this lightly over the plate, with a piece of 
soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry. When per- 
fectly dry, brush it off quite clean with a soft plate-brush, and 
polish the plate with a dry leather. If the plate be very dirty, 
or much tarnished, spirits of wine will be found to answer 
better than the water for mixing the paste. 

To Clean Decanters. — Roll up, in small pieces, some soft 
brown, or blotting, paper ; wet them, and soap them well. 
Put them into the decanters, about one-quarter full of warm 
water; shake them well for a few moments, then rinse with 
clear cold water ; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put 
the decanters to drain, and when dry, they will be almost as 
bright as new ones. 

Spots on Towels and Hosiery. — Spots on towels and hosiery 
will disappear with little trouble if a little ammonia is put into 
enough water to soak the articles, and they are left in it an 
hour or two before washing ; and if a cupful is put into the 
water in which white clothes are soaked, the night before 
washing, the ease with which the articles can be washed, and 
their great whiteness and clearness when dried, will be very 
gratifying. Remembering the small sum paid for three quarts 
of ammonia of common strength, one can easily see that no 
bleaching preparation can be more cheaply obtained. 

No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neglected and 
abused as the dishcloths and dish towels, and in washing 
these, ammonia, if properly used, is a greater comfort than 
anywhere else. Put a teaspoonful into the water in wliich 
these cloths are, or should be, washed every day; rub soap on 
the towels. Put them in the water, let them stand a half hour 
or so, then rub them out tlioroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry 
outdoors, in clear air and sun, and dishcloths and towels 
need never look gray and dingy — a perpetual discomfort to all 
housekeepers. 



— ISl — 

Croup. — Croup, it is said, can be cured in one minute, and 
the remedy is simply alum and sugar. The way to accomplish 
the deed is to take a knife or grater, and shave off, in small 
particles, about a teaspoonful of alum; then mix it with twice 
its amount of sugar, to make it palatable, and administer it as 
quickly as possible. Almost instantaneous relief will follow. 

Poison Ivy or Oak. — In the summer season, it is not an un- 
common thing for persons going into the woods, to be poi- 
soned by contact with dogwood, ivy, or the poison oak. The 
severe itching and smarting, which is thus produced, may be 
relieved by first washing the parts with a solution of salera- 
tus, two teaspoonfuls to the pint of water, and then applying 
cloths wet with extract of hamammellis. Take a dose of Ep- 
som salts internally, or a double Rochelle powder. 

Convulsion Fits.— Convulsion fits sometimes follow the fe- 
verish restlessness produced by these causes ; in which case 
a hot bath should be administered without delay, and the 
lower parts of the body rubbed, the bath being as hot as it can 
be without scalding the tender skin. 

Burns and Scalds. — A burn or scald is always painful ; but 
the pain can be instantly relieved by the use of bi-carbonate 
of soda, or common baking soda (saleratus). Put two table- 
spoonfuls of soda in a half cup of water. Wet a piece of 
linen cloth in the solution, and lay it on the burn. The pain 
will disappear as if by magic. If the burn is so deep that the 
skin has peeled off, dredge the dry soda directly on the part 
affected. 

Cuts. — For slight cuts, there is nothing better to control the 
hemorrhage than common unglazed brown wrapping paper, 
such as is used by marketmen and grocers ; a piece to be 
bound over the wound. 

Cold on the Chest — A flannel dipped in boiling water, and 
sprinkled with turpentine, laid on the chest, as quickly as pos- 
sible, will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness. 

Bleeding from the Nose. — Many children, especially those 
of a sanguineus temperament, are subject to sudden dis- 
charges of blood from some part of the bod}^; and as all such 
fluxes are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve 
the system from some overload or pressure, sucli discharges, 
unless in excess, and when likely to produce debility, should 



— 1st— 

not be raslily or too aDrttptlyxnieclvM. Tit general, these dis- 
charges are confined to tlie summer or spring months of the 
year, and follow pains in the head, a sense of drowsiness, lan- 
guor, or oppression; and as such symptoms are relieved by 
the loss of blood, the hemorrhage should, to a certain extent, 
be encouraged. When, however, the bleeding is excessive, or 
returns too frequently, it becomes necessary to apply means 
to subdue or mitigate the amount. For this purpose the sud- 
den and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient, in 
most cases, to arrest the most active hemorrhage. A wet 
towel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders, and 
placing the child in a recumbent posture, is often sufficient to 
effect the object; where, however, the effusion resists such 
simple means, napkins rung out of cold vvater must be laid 
across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped in cold water, 
and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet. If, in spite of 
these means, the bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a few 
folds of lint, tied together by a piece of thread, must be pushed 
up the nostril from which the blood flows, to act as a plug 
and pressure on the bleeding vessel. When the discharge has 
entirely ceased, the plug is to be pulled out by means of the 
thread. To prevent a repetition of the hemorrhage, the body 
should be sponged every morning v/ith cold water, and the 
child put under a course of steel wine, have open air exercise, 
and. if possible, salt-water bathing. For children, a key sud- 
denly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes, 
will often immediately arrest a copious bleeding. 

Chilblains. — Chilblains are most irritating to children. The 
following is an infallible cure for unbroken chilblains; 
Hydrochloric acid, diluted, one-quarter ounce; hydrocyanic 
acid, diluted, 30 drops; camphor- water, six ounces. This chil- 
blain lotion cures mild cases by one application. It is a deadly 
poison, and should be kept under lock and key. A responsi- 
ble person should apply it to the feet of children. This must 
not be applied to broken chilblains. * 

To Cure a Sting of Bee or Wasp.— Mix common earth 
with water to about the consistency of mud. Apply at once. 

For Toothache.— Alum reduced to an impalpable powder, 
two drachms; nitrous spirit of ether, seven drachms; mix and 
apply to the tooth. 



— 183 — 

Choking. — A piece of food lodged in the throat may some- 
times be pushed down with the finger, or removed with a hair- 
pin quickly straightened and hooked at the end, or by two or 
three vigorous blows on the back between the shoulders. 

Cramps in Infants. — A very excellent carminative powder 
for flatulent infants may be kept in the house, and employed 
with advantage, whenever the child is in pain or griped, by 
dropping five grains of oil of aniseed and two of peppermint 
on half an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a mortar, 
with a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder. A small 
quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time, 
and always with benefit. 

Cubeb Berries for Catarrh. — A new remedy for catarrh is 
crushed cubeb berries smoked in a pipe, emitting the smoke 
through the nose; after a few trials this will be easy to do. 
If the nose is stopped up so that it is almost impossible to 
breathe, one pipeful will make the head as clear as a bell. 
For sore throat, asthma and bronchitis, swallowing the smoke 
effects immediate relief. It is the best remedy in the world 
for offensive breath, and will make the most foul breath pure 
and sweet. Sufferers from that horrid disease, ulcerated 
catarrh, will find this remedy unequaled, and a month's use 
will cure the most obstinate case. A single trial will convince 
anyone. Eating the uncrushed berries is also good for sore 
throat and all bronchial complaints. After smoking, do not 
expose yourself to cold air for at least fifteen minutes. 

Diarrhoea. — For any form of diarrhoea that, by excessive 
action, demands a speedy correction, the most efficacious 
remedy that can be employed in all ages and conditions of 
childhood is the tincture of kino, of which from ten to thirty 
drops, mixed witli a little sugar and water in a spoon, are to 
be given every two or three hours till the undue action has 
been checked. Often the change of diet to rice, milk, eggs, or 
the substitution of animal for vegetable food, vice versa, will 
correct an unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea. 



If it is not convenient to fill flannel bags for the sick room 
with sand, bran will answer the purpose very well, and will 
retain the heat a long time. 



— 184 — 

Bites of Dogs. — The only safe remedy in case of a bite from 
a dog suspected of madness, is to burn out the wound thor- 
oughly with red-hot iron, or with lunar caustic, for fully eight 
seconds, so as to destroy the entire surface of the wound. Do 
this as soon as possible, for no time is to be lost. Of course 
it will be expected that the parts touched with the caustic will 
turn black. 

Measles and Scarlatina.— Measles and scarlatina much re- 
semble each other in their early stages ; headache, restless- 
ness, and fretfulness are the symptoms of both. Shivering 
fits, succeeded by a hot skin ; pains in the back and limbs, ac- 
companied by sickness, and, in severe cases, sore throat ; pain 
about the jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, 
which become red and inflamed, while the face is hot and 
flushed, often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever, of which 
it is only a mild form. While the case is doubtful, a dessert 
spoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water, given at bedtime, 
will throw the child into a geatle perspiration, and will 
bring out the rash in either case. In measles, this appears 
first on the face ; in scarlatina, on the chest ; and, in both 
cases, a doctor should be called in. In scarlatina, tartar- 
emetic powder or ipecacuhana may be administered in the 
meantime. 

Stye in the Eye. — Styes are little abscesses which form be- 
tween the roots of the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a 
small pea. The best way to manage them is to bathe them 
frequently with warm water ; or in warm poppy-water, if very 
painful. When they have burst, use an ointment composed 
of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti, well 
rubbed together, and smear along the edge of the eyelid. Give 
a grain or two of calomel with five or eight grains of rhubarb, 
according to the age of the child, twice a week. The old-fash- 
ioned and apparently absurd practice of rubbing the stye with 
a ring, is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of 
medicinal application; though the number of times it is rubbed, 
or the quality of the ring and direction of the strokes, has noth-^ 
ing to do with its success. That pressure and the friction ex- 
cite the vessels of the part, and cause an absorption of the 
efifused matter under the eyelash. The edge of the nail will 
answer as well as a ring. 



For Constipation. — One or two figs eaten fasting is suffi- 
cient for some, and they are especially good in the case of 
children, as there is no trouble in getting them to take them. 
A spoonful of wheaten bran in a gla&s of water is a simple 
remedy and quite effective. 

Leanness. — Is caused generally by lack of power in the di- 
gestive organs to digest and assimilate the fat-producing ele- 
ments of food. First restore digestion, take plenty of sleep, 
drink all the water the stomach will bear in the morning on 
rising, take moderate exercise in the open air, eat oatmeal, 
cracked wheat, Graham mush, baked sweet apples, roasted 
and broiled beef, cultivate jolly people, and bathe daily. 

Superfluous Hairs.— Are best left alone. Shaving only in- 
creases the strength of the hair, and all depilatories are dan- 
gerous and sometimes disfigure the face. The only sure plan 
is to spread on a piece of leather equal parts of galbanum and 
pitch plaster, lay it on the hair as smoothly as possible, let it 
remain three or four minutes, then remove it with the hairs, 
root and branch. This is severe but effective. Kerosene will 
also remove them. If sore after using, rub on sweet oil. 

The Breath. — Nothing makes one so disagreeable to others 
as a bad breath. It is caused by bad teeth, diseased stomach, 
or disease of the nostrils. Neatness and care of the health 
will prevent and cure it. 

The Quinine Cure for Drunkenness. — Pulverize one pound 
of fresh quill-red Peruvian bark, and soak it in one pint of 
diluted alcohol. Strain and evaporate down to one-half pint. 
For the first and second days give a teaspoonful every three 
liours. If too much is taken, headache will result, and in that 
case the doses should be diminished. On the third day give 
one-half a teaspoonful ; on the fourth reduce the dose to fifteen 
drops, then to ten, and then to five. Seven days, it is said, will 
cure average cases, though some require a whole month. 

For Sore Throat. — Cut slices of salt pork or fat bacon ; 
simmer a few moments in hot vinegar, and apply to throat as 
hot as possible. When this is taken off, as the throat is re- 
lieved, put around a bandage of soft flannel. A gargle of equal 
parts of borax and alum, dissolved in water, is also excellent. 
To be used frequently. 



— 180 — 

A Good Cure for Colds. — Boil two ounces of flaxseed in 
one quart of water ; strain and add Irwo ounces of rock candy, 
one-half pint of honey, juice of three lemons ; mix, and let all 
boil well ; let cool, and bottle. Dose : One cupful on going to 
bed, one-half cupful before meals. The hotter you drink it 
the better. 

To Stop Bleeding. — A handful of flour bound on the cut. 

A Healthful Appetizer. — How often we hear women who 
do their own cooking say that by the time they have prepared 
a meal, and it is ready for the table, they are too tired to eat. 
One way to mitigate this is to take, about half an hour before 
dinner, a raw Q^g, beat it until light, put in a little sugar and 
milk, flavor it, and '" drink it down ;" it will remove the faint, 
tired-out feeling, and will not spoil your appetite for dinner. 

To Remove Discoloration from Bruises.— Apply a cloth 
wrung out in very hot water, and renew frequently until the 
pain ceases. Or apply raw beefsteak. 

Earache. — There is scarcely any ache to which children are 
subject so hard to bear and difficult to cure as the earache ; 
but there is a remedy never known to fail. Take a bit of cot- 
ton batting, put upon it a pinch of black pepper, gather it up 
and tie it, dip in sweet oil and insert into the ear ; put a flan- 
nel bandage over the head to keep it warm. It will give im- 
mediate relief. As soon as any soreness is felt in the ear, let 
three or four drops of the tincture of arnica be poured in and 
the orifice be filled with a little cotton wool to exclude the air. 
If the arnica be not resorted to until there is actual pain, then 
the cure may not be as speedy, but it is just as certain, al- 
though it may be necessary to repeat the operation. It is a 
sure preventive against gathering in the ear, which is the 
usual cause of earache. 

To Cure Toothache.— The worst toothache, or neuralgia 
coming from the teeth, may be speedily and delightfully 
ended by the application of a bit of clean cotton, saturated in 
a solution of ammonia, to the defective tooth. Sometimes the 
late sufferer is prompted to momentary laughter by the appli- 
cation, but the pain will disappear. 

For Felon. — Take common rock salt, as used for salting 
down pork or beef, dry in an oven, then pound it fine and mix 
with spirits of turpentine in equal parts; put it in a rag 



— 187 — 

and wrap it around the parts affected ; as it gets dry put 
on more, and in twenty-four hours you are cured. The felon 
will be dead. 

Deodorizers. — Coffee pounded in a mortar and roas' ed on an 
iron plate ; sugar burned on hot coals, and vinegar boiled with 
myrrh and sprinkled on the floor and furniture of a sick room 
are excellent deodorizers. 

Boils. — The skin of a boiled egg is the most efficacious rem- 
edy that can be applied to aboil. Peel it carefully, wet and 
apply to the part affected. It will draw off the matter, and 
relieve the soreness in a few hours. 

To Cure a Whitlow. — As soon as the whitlow has risen dis- 
tinctly, a pretty large piece should be snipped out, so that tlie 
watery matter may readily escape, and continue to flow out 
as fast as produced. A bread-and-water poultice should be 
put on for a few days, when the wound should be bound up 
lightly w^ith some mild ointment, when a cure will be speedily 
completed. Constant poulticing both before and after the 
opening of the whitlow is the only practice needed ; but as the 
matter lies deep, when it is necessary to open the abscess, the 
incision must be made deep to reach the suppuration. 

Tape-Worms. - Tape-worms are said to be removed by re- 
fraining from supper and breakfast, and at eight o'clock tak- 
ing one-third part of two hundred minced pumpkin seeds, the 
shells of which have been removed by hot water ; at nine take 
another third, at ten the remainder, and follow it at eleven 
with strong dose of castor oil. 

For a Caked Breast.— Bake large potatoes, put two or more 
in a woolen stocking ; crush them soft and apply to the breast 
as hot as can be borne ; repeat constantly till relieved. 

Blistered Feet. — A good remedy for blistered feet from 
long walking is to rub the feet at going to bed with spirits 
mixed with tallow dropped from a lighted candle into the palm 
of the hand. 

Asthma. — A lady writes that sufferers from asthma should 
get a muskrat skin and wear it over their lungs, with the fur 
side next to the body. It will bring certain relief. 

Chapped Hands. — Powdered starch is an excellent prevent- 
ive of chapping of the hands, when it is rubbed over them af- 



— 188 — 

ter washing and drying them thoroughly. It will also pre- 
vent the needle, in sewing, from sticking and becoming rusty. 
It is therefore advisable to have a small box of it in the work- 
box or basket, and near your wash basin. 

Lunar Caustic for Warts. — Lunar caustic, carefully applied 
so as not t > touch the skin, will destroy warts. 

Cure for Rheumatism and Bilious Headache. — Finest Tur- 
key rhubarb, half an ounce ; carbonate magnesia, one ounce • 
mix intimately; keep well corked in glass bottle. Dose : One 
teaspoonful, in milk and sugar, the first thing in the morning; 
repeat till cured. Tried with success. 

Fever and Ague. — Four ounces galangal root, in a quart of 
gin, steeped in a warm place; take often. 

Fainting. — For a simple fainting fit, a horizontal position 
and fresh air will usually suffice. If a person received a se- 
vere shock, caused by a fall or blow, handle carefully with- 
out jarring. A horizontal position is best. Loosen all tight 
clothing from the throat, chest and waist. If the patient can 
swallow, give half teaspoonful aromatic spirits of ammonia 
in a little water. If that cannot be procured, give whiskey, or 
brandy and water. Apply warmth to the feet and bowels. 

To Restore from Stroke of Lightning. — Shower with cold 
water for two hours ; if the patient does not show signs of 
life, put salt in the water, and continue to shower an hour 
longer. 

Relief for Inflamed Feet. — The first thing to be done, is to 
take off and throw away tight-fitting boots, which hurt the ten- 
der feet as much as if they were put into a press. Then take one 
pint of wheat bran and one ounce of saleratus, and put it into 
a foot-bath, and add one gallon of hot water. When it has 
become cool enough, put in the feet, soak them for fifteen 
minutes, and the relief will be almost immediate. Repeat this 
every niglit for a week, and the cure will be complete. The 
burning, prickly sensation, is caused by the pores of the skin 
being closed up so tightly by the pressure of the boots that 
they cannot perspire freely. 

Warm Water as a Drink. — Warm water is preferable to 
cold water, as a drink, to persons who are subject to dys- 
peptic and bilious complaints, and it may be taken more freely 



— 18!t — 

than cold water, and, consequently, answers better, as a dilu- 
ent, for carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in the 
urinary secretion, in cases of stone and gravel. When water 
of a temperature equal to that of the human body is used for 
drink, it proves considerably stimulant, and is particularly 
suited to dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects. 

Cleaning House — Sitting and Dining Rooms. — By the time 
the upper part of the house is well cleaned and in good order, 
if it has been taken one room at a time, and leisurely, proba- 
bly, the dining room can be torn up on a warm and pleasant 
day, and unless the alterations are to be extensive, scoured, 
and gotten to rights again before nightfall, and the sitting 
room on another day. House cleaning, unless conducted on 
some plan which occasions little, if any, disturbance, in the 
general domestic arrangement, is a nuisance, particularly to 
the males of the household. Nothing can be (next to a miser- 
able dinner) more exasperating to a tired man, than to come 
home, and find the house topsy-turvy. And it certainly raises 
his opinion of his wife's executive ability, to find everything 
freshened and brightened, and that, without his having been 
annoyed by the odor of the soapsuds, or yet having been 
■obliged to betake himself to the kitchen for his meals. 

But if the order of work is well laid out the night before- 
hand, the breakfast as leisurely eaten as usual, and the fam- 
ily dispersed in their various ways before commencing opera- 
tions, then, by working with a will, wonders can be accom- 
plished in a very short time. It is not worth while to under- 
take a thorough cleaning of all extra china, silver and glass- 
ware, which may be stored in the china closet, in addition to 
the room itself. They can readily wait over until another 
morning, as can the examination of table linen. In cleaning 
any room, after the furniture and carpets have been taken 
out and the dust swept out with a damp broom, the proper 
order is to begin with the ceiling, then take the walls and 
windows, and, lastly, the floor, Kalsomine or whitewash 
dries most quickly exposed to free draughts of air, the win- 
dows being thrown wide open for the purpose ; this process 
can also be aided by lighting a fire in the room, either in the 
stove left for the purpose, or in the grate. These means are 
equally good for drying a freshly-scoured floor.

In lieu of regular carpet wadding, layers of newspapers are 
very good padding under a carpet", or, better yet, sheets of 
thick brown paper will answer very well. Matting and green 
linen shades are delightfully cool in either sitting or dining 
room, for summer use; or all through the hottest weather, if 
the dining room can be left with a bare floor, and lightly 
washed off with cold water before breakfast each day, it will 
add greatly to the coolness of the room. A fire-place can be 
arranged with a screen before it, or it can be left open, the 
fixtures taken away, and a large stone, or pottery jar, filled 
with fresh flowers daily, set into it. Very showy flowers can, 
in this way, be made effective in decorating a room. Jars cov- 
ered with pictures of decalcomania are tawdry looking. Bet- 
ter far to paint them a dull black or bottle-green, or a brick- 
red, with a plain band, or geometric design, traced in some 
contrasting color. 

In dining room furniture, oak wood, with green trimmings 
and light paint, are good contrasting colors, while black wal- 
nut or mahogany, with red carpet and shades of red predom- 
inating about the room, look well with dark paint. 

In arranging a sitting room, large spaces left empty, look 
more comfortable and are more convenient, in every way, 
than a room huddled too full of furniture. A home is not a 
furniture wareroom, nor a fancy bazaar, but a place for people 
to live in, and to grow in, and to move about in. 

House-cleaning time presents an opportunity for disposing 
of many ostensibly ornamental articles, which only serve to 
fill up space, without being either beautiful, or well made of 
their kind. 

An empty wall looks better than one hung with daubs. 
Good engravings and plain cheap frames are now obtained at 
such a trifling cost, that almost everyone can afford one or 
two excellent ones in their sitting room. People living at a 
distance can easily send to some large city for an engraving 
or two, or, if they prefer colored pictures, to some well-known 
establishment, for two or three good chromes. I have seen 
some of the best newspaper engravings pinned upon the sit- 
ting room wall, framed in pressed ferns, with very good ef- 
fect, indeed. Once, a very simple bracket held a glass bumper 
or unique pattern, from which was trailed cypress vines, and, 
mingled with them, a bunch of scarlet lychnis. Against the 



— 101 — 

white wall of the room they looked brilliant, and the effect 
was really beautiful. ''^'^' ^^^'^^- to usil nl 

When the sitting room is torn up, frequently an array of 
newspapers, missing books, etc., are found huddled together 
in some corner. In settling the room, these should find their 
proper places, and it would be a good tiling to keep them there 
ever after; for, no matter liow thorough is the cleaning process, 
untidiness and litter will soon make any room appear nearly 
as badly as before it was scoured. 

How tj Dust a Room. — Soft cloths make the best of dusters. 
In dusting any piece of furniture begin at the top and dust 
down, wiping carefully with the cloth, which can be fre- 
quently shaken. A good many people seem to have no idea 
what dusting is intended to accomplish, and instead of wip- 
ing off and removing the dust it is simply flirted off into the 
air and soon settles down upon the articles dusted again. If 
carefully taken up by the cloth it can be shaken off out of the 
window into the open air. If the furniture will permit the 
use of a damp cloth, that will more easily take up the dust, 
and it can be washed out in a pail of soap-suds. It is far easier 
to save work by covering up nice furniture while sweeping, 
than to clean the dust out, besides leaving the furniture look- 
ing far better in the long run. The blessing of plainness in 
decoration is appreciated by the thorough housekeeper who 
does her own work while dusting. 

Girls Learn to Cook, —Yes, yes, learn how to cook, girls; 
and learn how to cook well. What right has a girl to mari-y 
and go into a house of lier own unless she knows how to su- 
perintend every branch of housekeeping, and she cannot prop- 
erly superintend unless she has some practical knowledge 
herself. It is sometimes asked, sneeringly: "What kind of a 
man is he who would marry a cook?" The fact is, that men 
do not think enough of this; indeed, most men marry without 
thinking whether the woman of his choice is capable of cook- 
ing him a meal, and it is a pity he is so short-sighted, as his 
liealth, his cheerfulness, and, indeed, his success in life, de- 
pend in a very great degree on the kind of food he eats; in 
fact, the whole household is influenced by the diet. Feed them 
on fried cakes, fried meats, hot bread and other indigestible 



— 19-2 — 

viands, day after day, and they will need medicine to make 
them well. 

Let all girls have a share in housekeeping at home before 
they marry; let each superintend some department by turns. 
It need not occupy half the time to see that the house has 
been properly swept, dusted, and put in order, to prepare pud- 
dings and make dishes, that many young ladies spend in read- 
ing novels which enervate both mind and body and unfit 
them for every-day life. Women do not, as a general rule, 
get pale faces doing housework. Their sedentary habits, in 
overheated rooms, combined with ill-chosen food, are to blame 
for bad health. Our mothers used to pride themselves on their 
housekeeping and fine needlework. Let the present genera- 
tion add to its list of real accomplishments the art of properly 
preparing food for the human body. 

Children Love Games. — Take advantage of this to give 
them physical training. Furnish them the apparatus for 
games which requires a good deal of muscular exercise- 
Those curious little affairs which require them to sit on the 
floor or gather about the table and remain in a cramped posi- 
tion, are not advisable. 

It is particularly desirable that the games should call them 
into the open air and sunshine. In this way children lay in a 
stock of health and strength. Remember that, particularly 
in our early years, this is infinitely more important than all 
adornments of the person or study of books. 

Let it not be forgotten that the symmetrical development of 
the body is of the utmost importance. A child, for example, 
is iveak and round-shouldered. It is important that he should 
be made strong. It is not less important that he should be 
made straight. Every conceivable exercise may tend to in- 
crease the strength, but only special exercises tend to draw 
the shoulders back, and thus secure the rectitude which is the 
basis of spinal and visceral tone. It is not difficult to give 
children such games and sports as will have this special 
tendency. 

Teach Your Own Children.- Some parents allow their chil- 
dren to acquire the very rude and unmannerly habit of break- 
ing in upon their conversation and those of older persons with 
questions and remarks of their own. It is very uncivil to 



— lo:] — 

allow them to do so. So, even among their own brothers and 
sisters and schoolmates, of their own age, let them speak 
without interrupting. If one begins to tell a story or bit of 
news, teach them to let him finish it; and if he makes mis- 
takes that ought to be corrected, do it afterwards. Don't 
allow them to acquire the habit of being interrupters. Most 
of those who allow their own children to form this disagree- 
able habit will be exceedingly annoyed at the same conduct 
in other folks' children. The fault is that of the parents in 
not teaching their children. If they interrupt at home, tell 
them to wait till they can converse without annoying, and see 
that they do it. 

Packing away Furs.— All furs should be well switched and 
beaten lightly, free from dust and loose hairs, well wrapped 
in newspaper, with bits of camphor laid about them and in 
them, and put away in a cool dark place. If a cedar closet or 
chest is to be had, laid into that. In lieu of that, new cedar 
chips may be scattered about. It is never well to delay pack- 
ing furs away until quite late in the season, for the moth will 
very early commence depredations. In packing them they 
should not be rolled so tightly as to be crushed and damaged. 

All About Kitchen Work.— A lady who for a time was com- 
pelled to do all of her own kitchen work says: " If every iron 
pot, pan, kettle, or any utensil used in the cooking of food, be 
washed as soon as emptied, and while still hot, half the labor 
will be saved."' It is a simple habit to acquire, and the wash- 
ing of pots and kettles by this means loses some of its distaste- 
ful aspects. No lady seriously objects to washing and wiping 
the crystal and silver ; but to tackle the black, greasy, and 
formidable-looking ironware of th^ kitchen takes a good deal 
of sturdy brawn and muscle as well as common-sense. 

If the range be wiped carefully with brown paper, after cook- 
ing greasy food, it can be kept bright with little difficulty. 

Stoves and ranges should be kept free from soot in all com- 
partments. A clogged hot-air passage will prevent any oven 
from baking well. 

When the draught is imperfect the defect frequently arises 
from the chimney being too low. To remedy the evil the 
chimney should be built up, or a cliimney-pot added. 

It is an excellent plan for tlie mistress to acquaint herself 



— 194 — 

with the practical workings of her range, unless her servants 
are exceptionally good, for many hindrances to well- cooked 
food arise from some misunderstanding of, or imperfection 
in, this article. 

A clean, tidy kitchen can only be secured by having a place 
for everything and everything in its place, and by frequent 
scourings of the room and utensils. 

A hand-towel and basin are needed in every kitchen for the 
use of the cook or house- worker. 

Unless dish-towels are washed, scalded and thoroughly dried 
daily, they become musty and unfit for use, as does also the 
dishclotli. 

Cinders make a very hot fire — one particularly good for 
ironing days. 

Milk keeps from souring longer in a shallow pan than in a 
milk pitcher. Deep pans make an equal amount of cream. 

Hash smoothly plastered down will sour more readily than 
if left in broken masses in the chopping bowl, each mass be- 
ing well exposed to the air. 

Sauce, plain, and for immediate use, should not be put into 
a jar and covered while warm, else it will change and ferment 
very quickly. It will keep some days with care in the putting 
up. Let it stand until perfectly cold, then put into a stone jar. 

To scatter the Philadelphia brick over tlie scouring board 
and on the floor, to leave the soap in the bottom of the scrub- 
bing pail, the sapolio in the basin of water, and to spatter the 
black lead or stove polish on the floor are wasteful, slatternly 
habits. 

A clock in the kitchen is both useful and necessary. 

A Nice Clothes Frame. — Our kitchen is very small; too small, 
in fact, to be very comfortable in, and, moreover, has to serve 
the double purpose of kitchen and laundry. There was no 
room to spare for the large clothes-horse we had been accus- 
tomed to use, nor even for a smaller clothes-screen we thought 
of purchasing. In this emergency we happened upon a nice 
frame, which consists of bars of wood secured at one end in 
an iron clamp, which screws on to the side of the window 
frame. These bars move freely around, and quite a respecta- 
ble sized ironing can be aired upon them. We found they 
were invented and made by a dealer in the country who had 



— 195 — 

no patent upon them, and so, of course, his sales must be lim- 
ited, yet they are very convenient. The clothes are hung 
quite out of the way, and yet can be well aired. 

Keep the Cellar Clean. - A great deal of the sickness fam- 
ilies suffer could be easily traced to the cellar. The cellar not 
unusually opens into the kitchen, the kitchen is heated, and 
the cellar is not. Following natural laws, the colder air of 
the cellar will rush to take the place of the warmer, and there- 
fore, lighter air of the kitchen. Tliis would be well enough if 
the cellar air was pure, but often it is not ; partly decayed 
vegetables may be there, or rotten wood, etc. A day should 
be taken to throw out and carry away all dirt, rotten woods, 
decaying vegetables, and other accumulations that have gath- 
ered there. Brush down the cobwebs, and with a bucket of 
lime give the walls and ceiling a good coat of whitewash. If 
a whitewash brush is not at hand take an old broom that the 
good wife has worn out, and spread the whitewash on thick 
and strong. It will sweeten up the air in the cellar, the par- 
lor, and the bedrooms, and it may save the family from the 
afflictions of fevers, diphtheria and doctors. 

Sunlit Rooms. — No article of furniture sliould be put in a 
room that will not stand sunlight, for every room in a dwell- 
ing should have the windows so arranged that some time dur- 
ing the day a flood of sunlight will force itself into the apart- 
ments. The importance of admitting the light of the sun 
freely to all parts of our dwellings cannot be too highly esti- 
mated. Indeed, perfect health is nearly as much dependent 
on pure sunlight as it is on pure air. Sunlight should never 
be excluded except when so bright as to be uncomfortable to 
the eyes. And walks should be in bright sunlight, so that 
the eyes are protected by veil or parasol when inconven- 
iently intense, A sun-bath is of more importance in pre- 
serving a healthful condition of the body than is generally 
understood. 

A sun-bath costs nothing, and that is a misfortune, for peo- 
ple are deluded with the idea that those things only can be 
good or useful which cost money. But remember that pure 
water, fresh air and sunlit homes kept free from dampness, 
will secure you from many heavy bills of the doctors, and give 
you health and vigor, which no money can procure. It is a 



— 1 90 — 

well-established fact that j)eople who live much in the sun are 
usually stronger and more healthy thafi those whose occupa- 
tions deprive them of sunlight. And certainly there is noth- 
ing strange in the result, since the same law applies with 
nearly equal force to every animate thing in nature. It is 
quite easy to arrange an isolated dwelling so that every room 
may be flooded with sunlight some time in the day, and it is 
possible many town houses could be so built as to admit more 
light than they now receive. 

Pleasant Homes. — Handsome furniture will not, unaided, 
make rooms cheerful. The charm of a cosy home rests prin- 
cipally with its mistress. If she is fortunate enough to have 
sunny rooms, her task is half done. In apartments into which 
the sun never shines recourse must be had to various devices 
to make up, so far as may be, for this grave lack. A sunless 
room should have bright and joyous color in its furnishings. 
The walls should be warmly tinted, the curtains give a roseate 
glow to the light that passes through them. An open fire 
may diffuse tlip sunshine but lately imprisoned in oak or 
hickory, or ages ago locked up in anthracite. Ferneries and 
shade-loving plants may contribute their gentle cheer to the 
room and suggest quiet forest nooks. An attractive room 
need not be too orderly. A book left lying on the table, a bit 
of needle-work on the window-sill, an open piano, may indi- 
cate the tastes and occupations of the inmates without sug- 
gesting that there is not a place for everything in that room. 
There is such a thing as being too neat and nice to take com- 
fort in everyday life, and this is anything but cheerful. And 
then there is such a thing as beingso disorderly and negligent 
that comfort and cheer are impossible. If the house-mother 
cannot rest while there is a finger-mark on the paint or a spot 
on the window-panes, she may make a neat room, but her 
splint will keep it from ever being cheerful. If she has no 
care for the " looks of things " her failure will be equally sure. 
A bird singing in the window, an aquarium on the table in 
some corner, plants growing and blooming, domestic pets 
moving about as if at home, these give life and brightness to 
an apartment, and afford constant opportunities forthepleas- 
antest occupation and companionship. Books people a room, 
and pictures on the walls, if selected with taste, are ever fresh 



— 197 — 

sources of enjoyment. You may gauge the refinemeait and 
cultivation of a family by these infallible tests, unless they 
have been selected by some outsider. Bits of embroidery, 
of scroll-work, and a thousand tasteful devices may con- 
tribute to the charm of a room and make it irresistibly at- 
tractive. 

How to be Handsome. —Where is the woman who would 
not be beautiful ? If such there be — but no, she does not exist. 
From that memorable day when the Queen of Sheba made a 
formal call on the late lamented King Solomon until the re- 
cent advent of the Jersey Lily, the power of beauty has con- 
trolled the fate of dynasties and the lives of men. How to be 
beautiful, and consequently powerful, is a question of far 
greater importance to the feminine mind than predestination 
or any other abstract subject. If women are to govern, con- 
trol, manage, influence, and retain the adoration < f husbands, 
fathers, brothers, lovers, or even cousins, they must look their 
prettiest at all times. 

AH women cannot have good features, but they can look 
well, and it is possible to a great extent to correct deformity 
and develop much of the figure. The first step to good looks 
is good health, and the first element of health is cleanliness. 
Keep clean — wash freely, bathe regularly. All the skin wants 
is leave to act, and it takes care of itself. In the matter of 
baths we do not strongly advocate a plunge in ice-cold water ; 
it takes a woman with some of the clear grit that Robert 
Collyer loves to dilate on and a strong constitution to endure 
it. If a hot bath be used, let it come before retiring, as there 
is less danger of taking cold afterward; and, besides, the body 
is weakened by the ablution and needs immediate rest. It is 
well to use a flesh brush, and afterwards rinse off the soap- 
suds by briskly rubbing the body with a pair of coarse toilet 
gloves. The most important part of a bath is the drying. 
Every part of the body should be rubbed to a glowing redness, 
using a coarse crash towel at the finish. If sufficient friction 
cannot be given, a small amount of bay rum applied with the 
palm of the hand will be found efficacious. Ladies who have 
ample leisure and who lead methodical lives take a plunge 
or sponge bath three times a week, and a vapor or sun bath 
every day. To facilitate this very beneficial practice a south 



— 198 — 

or east apartment is desirable. The lady denudes herself, takes 
a seat near the window, and takes in the warm rays of the 
sun. The effect is both beneficial and delightful. If, however, 
she be of a restless disposition, she may dance, instead of 
basking, in the sunlight. Or, if she be not foncJt of dancing, 
she may improve the shining hours by taking down her hair 
and brushing it, using sulphur water, pulverized borax dis- 
solved in alcohol, or some similar dressing. It would be sur- 
prising to many ladies to see her carefully wiping the sepa- 
rate locks on a clean, white towel until the dust of the pre- 
vious day is entirely removed. With such care it is not neces- 
sary to wash the head, and the hair under this treatment is in- 
variably good. 

One of the most useful articles of the toilet is a bottle of 
ammonia, and any lady who has once learned its value will 
never be without it. A few drops in the water takes the place 
of the usual amount of soap, and cleans out the pores of the 
skin as well as a bleach will do. Wash the face with a flesh 
brush, and rub the lips well to tone their color. It is well to 
bathe the eyes before putting in the spirits, and if it is desira- 
ble to increase their brightness, this may be done by dashing 
soapsuds into them. Always rub the eyes, in washing, toward 
the nose. If the eyebrows are inclined to spread irregularly, 
pinch the hairs together where thickest. If they show a tend- 
ency to meet, this contact may be avoided by pulling out the 
hairs every morning before the toilet. 

The dash of Orientalism in costume and lace now turns a 
lady's attention to her eyelashes, which are worthless if not 
long and drooping. Indeed, so prevalent is the desire for this 
beautiful feature that hair-dressers and ladies' artists have 
scores of customers under treatment for invigorating their 
stunted eyelashes and eyebrows. To obtain these fringed 
curtains, anoint the roots with a balsam made of two drachms 
of nitric oxide of mercury mixed with one of leaf lard. After 
an application wash the roots withacamel's-hair brush dipped 
in warm milk. Tiny scissors are used, with which the lashes 
are carefully but slightly trimmed every other day. When 
once obtained, refrain from rubbing or even touching the lids 
with the finger-nails. There is more beauty in a pair of well- 
kept eyebrows and full, sweeping eyelashes than people are 



— 199 — 

aware of, and a very inattractive and lustreless eye assumes 
new beauty when it looks out from beneatli elongated fringes. 
Many ladies have a habit of rubbing the corners of their eyes 
to remove the dust that will frequently accumulate there. 
Unless this operation is done with little friction it will be 
found that the growth of hair is very spare, and in that case 
it will become necessary to pencil the barren corners. In- 
stead of putting cologne water on the handkercliief, which has 
come to be considered a vulgarism among ladies of correct 
taste, the perfume is spent on the eyebrows and lobes of the 
ears. 

If commenced in youth, thick lips may be reduced by com- 
pression, and thin linear ones are easily modified by suction. 
This draws the blood to the surfaces, and produces at first a 
temporary and, later, a permanent inflation. It is a mistaken 
belief that biting the lips reddens them. The skin of the lips 
is very thin, rendering them extremely susceptible to organic 
derangement, and if the atmosphere does not cause chaps or 
parchment, the result of such harsh treatment will develop 
into swelling or tlie formation of scars. Above all things, 
keep a sweet breatli. 

Everybody cannot Iiave beautiful hands, but there is no 
plausible reason for their being ill-kept. Red hands may be 
overcome by soaking the feet in hot water as often as possi- 
ble. If the skin is liard and dry, use tar or oatmeal soap, 
saturate them with glycerine, and wear gloves in bed. Never 
bathe them in hot water, and wash no oftener than is neces- 
sary. There are dozens of women with soft, white hands who 
do not put them in water once a month. Rubber gloves are 
worn in making the toilet, and they are cared for by an oint- 
ment of glycerine and rubbed dry with chamois skin or cotton 
flannel. The same treatment is not un frequently applied to 
the face with the most successful results. If such methods 
are used, it would be just as well to keep the knowledge of it 
from the gentlemen. We know of one beautiful lady who 
has not washed her face for three years, yet it is always clean, 
rosy, sweet, and kissable. With some of her other secrets 
she gave it to her lover for safe keeping. Unfortunately, it 
proved to be her last gift to that gentleman, who declared in 
a subsequent note that *' I cannot reconcile my heart and my 



— 200 — 

manhood to a woman who can get along without washing 
her face." 

Some of the Secrets of Beauty. — There is as much a 
"fashion" in complexions as there is in bonnets or boots. 
Sometimes nature is the mode, sometimes art. Just now the 
latter is in the ascendant, though, as a rule, only in that infe- 
rior phase which has not reached the " concealment of art" — 
the point where extremes meet and the perfection of artifice 
presents all the appearance of artlessness. No one of an ob- 
servant turn of mind, who is accustomed to the sight of English 
maids and matrons, can deny that making-up, as at present 
practiced, partakes of the amateurish element. Impossible 
reds and whites grow still more im^Dossibly red and white from 
week to week, under the unskilled hands of the wearer of 
'' false colors," who does not like to ask for advice on so deli- 
cate a subject, for, even were she willing to confess to the 
practice, the imputation of experience conveyed in the asking 
for counsel might be badly received, and would scarcly be in 
good taste. 

The prevalent and increasing short-sightedness of our 
times is, perhaps, partly the cause of the excessive use of 
rouge and powder. The wielder of the powder-puff sees her- 
self afar off, as it were. She knows that she cannot judge of 
the effect of her complexion with her face almost touching its 
reflection in the glass, and, standing about a yard off, she nat- 
urally accentuates her roses and lilies in a way that looks very 
pleasing to her, but is rather startling to any one with longer 
sight. Nor can she tone down her rouge with the powdered 
hair that softened the artificial coloring of her grandmother 
when she had her day. Powder is only occasionally worn 
with evening dress, and it is by daylight that those dreadful 
bluish reds and whites look their worst. 

On the other hand, there are some women so clever at mak- 
ing up their faces that one almost feels inclined to condone 
the practice in admiration of the result. These are the small 
minority, and are likely to remain so, for their secret is of a 
kind unlikely to be shared. The closest inspection of these 
cleverly managed complexions reveals no trace of art. 

Notwithstanding the reticence of these skilled artists, an 
occasional burst of confidence has revealed a few of their 



— 201 — 

means of accomplishing the great end of looking pretty. "Da 
you often do that?'' said one of these clever ones, a matron of 
tliirt3'-seven, who looked like a girl of nineteen, to a friend 
who was vigorously rubbing her cheeks with a coarse towel 
after a plentiful application of cold water. 

"Yes, every time I come in from a walk, ride, or drive. 
Why?" 

"Well, no wonder you look older than you are. You are 
simply wearing your face out!" 

"But I must wash?" 

"Certainly, but not like that. Take a leaf out of my book; 
never wash your face just before going out into the fresh air, 
or just after coming in. Nothing is more injurious to the skin. 
Come to the glass. Do you notice a drawn look about your 
eyes and a general streakiness in the cheeks? That is the result 
of your violent assault upon your complexion just now. You 
look at this moment ten years older than you did twenty min- 
utes ago in the park." 

"Well, I really do. I look old enough to be your mother; 
but then, you are wonderful. You always look so young and 
fresh." 

"Because I never treat my poor face so badly as you do 
yours. I use rain-water, and if I cannot get that, I have the 
water filtered. When I dress for dinner I always wash my 
face with milk, adding just enough hot water to make it 
pleasant to use. A very soft sponge and very fine towel take 
the place of your terrible huckaback arrangement." 

Two or three years ago a lady of Oriental parentage on her 
father's side spent a season in London society. Her complex- 
ion was brown, relieved by yellow, her features large and 
irregular, but redeemed by a pair of lovely and expressive 
eyes. So perfect was her taste in dress that she always 
attracted admiration wherever she went. Dressed in rich 
dark browns or dullest crimsons or russets, so that no one 
ever noticed much what she wore, she so managed that sug- 
gestions and hints — no more — of brilliant amber or pomegran- 
ate scarlet should appear just where they imparted brilliancy 
to her deep coloring, and abstract all the yellow from her , 
skin. A knot of old gold satin under tlie rim of her bonnet, 
another at her throat, and others in among the lace at her 



— 20;i — 

wrists, brightened up the otherwise subdued tinting of her 
costume, so that it always looked as though it had been de- 
signed/ expressly for her by some great colorist. Here rouge 
was unnecessary. The surroundings were arranged to suit 
the complexion, instead of the complexion to suit the sur- 
roundings. There can be no doubt as to which is the inethod 
which best becomes the gentlewoman. 

In addition to the disagreeable sensation of making-up, it 
nmst be remembered that the use of some of the white pow- 
ders eventually destroys the texture of the skin, rendering it 
rough and coarse Rimmel, the celebrated perfumer, in his 
"Book of Perfumes," says that rouge, being composed of 
cochineal and saffron, is harmless, but that white cosmetics 
consist occasionally of deleterious substances which may in- 
jure the health. He advises actors and actresses to choose 
cosmetics, especially the white, with the greatest care, and 
women of the world, who wish to preserve the freshness of 
their complexions, to observe the following recipe: Open air. 
rest, exercise, and cold water. In another part of this pleas- 
ant book its author says that schonada, a cosmetic used 
among the Arabs, is quite innocuous and at the same time 
effectual. "This cream, which consists of sublimated benzoin, 
acts upon the skin as a slight stimulant, and imparts perfectly 
natural colors during some hours without occasioning the in- 
conveniences with which European cosmetics may justly be 
reproached." It is a well-known fact that bismuth, a white 
powder containing sugar of lead, injures the nerve-centres 
when constantly employed, and occasionally causes paralysis 
itself. 

In getting up the eyes, nothing is injurious that is not 
dropped into them. The use of kohl or kohol is quite harm- 
less, and, it must be confessed, very effective when applied — 
as the famous recipe for salad dressing enjoins with regard to 
the vinegar — by the hand of a miser. Modern Egyptian ladies 
make their kohol of the smoke produced by burning almonds. 
A small bag holding the bottle of kohol, and a pin, with a 
rounded point with which to apply it, form part of the toilet 
paraphernalia of all the beauties of Cairo, who make the im- 
mense mistake of getting up their eyes in an exactly similar 
manner, thus trying to reduce the endless variety of nature to 



— 203 — 

one common pattern, a mistake that may be accounted for by 
the fact that the Arabs believe kohol to be a sovereign specific 
against ophthalmia. Their English sisters often make the 
same mistake without the same excuse. A hairpin steeped in 
lampblack is the usual method of darkening the eyes in Eng- 
land, retribution following sooner or later in the shape of a 
total loss of the eyelashes. Eau de Cologne is occasionally 
dropped into the eyes, with the effect of making them brighter. 
The operation is painful, and it is said that half-a-dozen drops 
of whiskey, and the same quantity of Eau de Cologne, eaten 
on a lump of sugai-, is quite as effective. 

Headache. — One of our English contemporaries has wisely 
been devoting some thought and space to the common and dis- 
tressing fact that a great many English women suffer from 
headache. The same trouble prevails in America, and men, 
no matter how selfish they may be, are deeply concerned 
about it, for a wife with a headache cannot be companionable; 
the best of sweethearts with a headache is sure to be unrea- 
sonable, while a lady who has neither husband or other spe- 
cial cavalier to engross her attention, can ruin the peace of 
mind of every one she meets wliile she has a headache of per- 
ceptible size. No amount of masculine grumbling is likely to 
change all this, but women themselves might change it if they 
would comprehend the causes of the malady, and then apply 
their nimble wits to the work of prevention or cure. 

The trouble is that all American women who have head- 
aches live indoors, where the best air is never good and the 
worst is poison, and they have none of the exercise which saves 
man from the popular feminine malady. Were a strong man 
to eat breakfast at any ordinary American table and then sit 
down at a work-table or even move about briskly from one 
room to another, he would have a splitting headache before 
noon, and the chatter of his innocent children would seem to 
be the jargon of fiends. The midday meal would increase his 
wretchedness, and by dusk he would be stretched in misery 
upon his bed, with one hand mopping his forehead with ice- 
water, while the other would threaten with a club or pistol any 
one who dared to enter the room or make a noise outside. 
There is no reason wliy women should not suffer just as se~ 



— 304 — 

•verely for similar transgressions of physical law. True, in- 
door life is compulsory for a large portion every day, but spe- 
cial physical exercise in a well-aired room is within the reach 
of almost every woman, and so is a brisk walk in garments 
2iot so tight as to prevent free respiration. There is very lit- 
tle complaint at summer resorts, where windows are always 
open and games and excursions continually tempt women who 
do not value complexion more than health. Girls who ride^ 
row, sail, and shoot, seldom have headaches ; neither do those 
unfortunate enough to be compelled to hoe potatoes or play 
Maud Muller in hay-fields. Let women of all social grades 
remember that the human machine must have reasonable 
treatment, and be kept at work or play to keep it from rust- 
ing, then headaches will be rare enough to be interesting. 

High-Heeled Boots Must Go. — A lady looks infinitely taller 
and slimmer in a long dress than she does in a short costume, 
and there is always a way of showing the feet, if desired, by 
making the front quite short, which gives, indeed, a more 
youthful appearance to a train dress. The greatest attention 
must, of course, be paid to the feet with these short dresses, 
and I may here at once state that high heels are absolutely 
forbidden by fashion. Doctors, are you content ? Only on 
cheap shoes and boots are they now made, and are only worn 
by common people. A good bootmaker will not make high 
heels now. even if paid double price to do so. Ladies — that is, 
real ladies— now wear flat soled shoes and boots, i la Cinder- 
ella. For morning walking, boots or high Moliere shoes are 
worn. 

If you wear boots you may wear any stockings you like, for 
no one sees them. But if you wear shoes you inust adapt 
your stockings to your dress. Floss silk, Scotch thread, and 
even cotton stockings are worn for walking, silk stockings 
having returned into exclusively evening wear. Day stock- 
ings should be of the same color as the dress, but they may be 
shaded, or striped, or dotted, just as you please. White stock- 
ings are absolutely forbidden for day wear-r-no one wears 
them — no one dares wear them under fashion's interdiction. 

Don't Stoop. — Grandmother has noticed that some of her 
boys lately have acquired a very bad habit. They go about 



— 205 — 

with their backs bent, as if they were fifty years old, and were 
bearing the responsibilities of age on their shoulders. This is 
all wrong. Stand up straight, boys ; don't go around with a 
•• stoop in your back," as if you had a curvature of the spine. 
If 3'ou do, depend upon it. you will have it sure enough long 
before yoa get to be old. Always stand erect, and when you 
walk, throw back your shoulders, and take that kink out of 
your backbone. This is easier said than done, isn't it ?• 
Grandma will tell you just liow you can do it, and remember 
every word she says, for she has been through it all herself, 
and has straightened up many a grandchild in more respects 
than one. Here is her rule: 

•'throw up your chin !"' 

The whole secret of standing and walking erect consists in 
keeping the chin well away from the breast. This throws the 
head upward and backward, and the shoulders will naturally 
settle backward and in their true position. Those who stoop 
in walking generally look downward. The proper way is to 
look straight ahead, upon the same level with your eyes, or if 
you are inclined to stoop, until that tendency is overcome, 
look rather above than below the level. Mountaineers are 
said to be as " straight as an arrow," and the reason is be- 
cause they are obliged to look upward so much. It is simply 
impossible to stoop in walking if you will heed and practice 
this rule. You will notice that all round-shouldered persons 
carry the chin near the breast and pointed downward. Take 
warning in time, and heed grandmother's advice, for a bad 
habit is more easily prevented than cured. The habit of 
stooping when one walks or stands is a bad habit and espec- 
ially hard to cure. 

Make Home Pleasant.— A cheerful, happy home is the 
greatest safeguard against temptations for the young. Parents 
should spare no pains to make home a cheerful spot. There 
should be pictures to adorn the walls, flowers to cultivate the 
finer sensibilities, dominoes, checkers, and other games, enter- 
taining books and instructive newspapers and periodicals. 
•These things, no doubt, cost money, but not a tithe the amount 
that one of the lesser vices will cost — vices which are sure to 
be acquired away from home, but seldom there. Then there 



— 20i) — 

should be social pleasures — a gathering of young and old 
around the hearthstone, a warm welcome to the neighbor who 
drops in to pass a pleasant hour. There should be music and .. 
amusements and reading. The tastes of all should be con- 
sulted, until each member of the family looks forward to the 
hour of reunion around the hearth as the brightest one in the 
twenty-four. Wherever there is found a pleasant, cheerful, 
neat, attractive, inexpensive home, there you may be sure t6 ' 
find the abode of the domestic virtues ; there will be no dis- 
sipated husbands, no discontented or discouraged wives, no 
""fast" sons or frivolous daughters I 

Laughter. — ''The laughter of girls is, and ever was, among 
the most delightful sounds of earth. " Truly there is nothing 
sweeter or pleasanter to the ear than the merry laugh of a 
happy, joyous girl, and nothing dissipates gloom and sadness 
quicker, and drives dull care away like a good, hearty laugh. 
We do not laugh enough ; nature should teach us this lesson, 
it is true : the earth needs the showers, but if it did not catch 
and hold the sunshine too where would be the brightness and 
beauty it lavishes upon us ? Laugh heartily, laugh often, 
girls ; not boisterously, but let the gladness of your hearts 
bubble up once in a while, and overflow in a glad, mirthfuL 

laugh. '

Items Worth Remembering. — A sun batTi is of more worth:; 
than much warming by the fire. 

Books exposed to the atmosphere keep in better condition 
than if confined in a bookcase. 

Pictures are both for use and ornament. They serve to re- 
call pleasant memories and scenes ; they harmonize with the 
furnishing of the rooms. If they serve neither of these pur- 
poses they are worse than useless ; they only help fill space 
which would look better empty, or gather dust and make work 
to keep them clean. 

A room filled with quantities of trifling ornaments have the 
look of a bazaar, and displays neither good taste or good 
sense. Artistic excellence aims to have all the furnishings 
of a high order of workmanship combined with simplicity, . 
while good sense understands the folly of dusting a lot of 
rubbish. 



— ;i07 — 

A poor book liad best be burned to give place to a better, 
or even to an empty shelf, for the fire destroys its poison, and 
puts it out of the way of doing harm. 

Better economize in the purchasing of furniture or carpets, 
than scrimp in buying good books or papers. 

Our sitting-rooms need never be empty of guests or our 
libraries of society, if the company of good books is admitted 
to. them. 

Those Ungraceful Habits. — A public conveyance brings 
one awkwardly near the faces of strangers. Perhaps from 
sheer inanity one is apt to take undue notice of his fellow-pas- 
sengers. AVhen glances meet, the gaze is lowered to the 
flounces of the lady seated near, or to the trim, polished boot 
of a gent at the far end of the car. There are nice people 
everywhere, and if one is artistic in taste there will ever be a 
looking for beauty of face or form, in dress, or carriage, or 
manner, or speech ; but "why is the fresh girl face so often 
marred by the ugly habit of cribbing ?" "A beautiful woman," 
whispered a friend, and the eye was attracted toward a grand 
looking lady with wide, white forehead, from which the brown 
glossy hair was smoothed away without the ghost of a crimp ; 
there were pretty arching brows, shading lashes, shapely nose, 
but, alas ! for the ruby lips bitten and moistened]so often as to 
prevent the possibility of catching the outline — the profile so 
needful to the sketcher of beauty. A poet has somewhere 
said that ""affectation begins with the mouth,-' but "who 
would charge the gentle sex with vanity." 

What ! T(^ redden by biting, or brighten by wetting ; that 
folly could not be. Let us rather suppose the fair one had by 
some mishap forgotten to lunch, and all this is due to the 
gnawings of hunger. While thus seeking to palliate the fair 
cribber, a young man becomes noticeable by persistently pull- 
ing at the ends of his moustache, chewing them in a hungry 
way, now changing the exercise by twisting them to needle- 
like points which he seemed to be coaxing upward. 

"From whence has come this ugly habit ?"' one is fain to 
ask. Certainly not from pride. A fine flowing beard and full 
moustache ought not to be a cause of folly to the owner. The 
hairs of the face, given to protect the throat and lungs, never 



— ^8 — 

to be shorn in the cold seasons, can it be that there is nutri- 
ment in them ? While thus questioning, the writers two 
hands were suddenly jerked from his side pockets, where they 
had been comfortably resting. The wife's gentle remonstrance 
had been brought to mind by the entrance of an awkward fel- 
low, with hands deeply thrust in the pockets of his torn pants. 
A caricature of one's self is often a tacit reproof. That very 
morning the dear wife had said : " Those torn side-pockets are 
the most difficult of tears to mend." And the inward monitor 
asked : " From whence has come this indolent habit ? From 
love of ease or want of mittens, which ? Perhaps indifference 
of the patient mender's." And again the monitor asked : 

" What of that habit not comparable to weeds for growth ?" 

*' What mean you ?" was meekly asked. 

" That of looking well to one's own faults, that lesson the 
hardest and latest learned : to know thyself." Then the writer 
realized that he, too, was not quite perfect.

WALTER BAKER & CO.'S 



BREAKFAST COCOA 




Professor James F. Babcock, the well-known chemical expert, for 
many years State Assayer for Massachusetts, recently purchased in open 
market a sample of Walter Baker & Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa, and, 
after making a careful analysis, filed the following: certificate : — 

Boston, January 20, 1892. 
'FHIS certifies that I have made a very thorough chemical and microscopic examina- 
tion of the article known is Walter Baker & Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa, and I 
have compared the results with those found from a similar examination of the pure 
roasted cocoa-bean. 

I find that Walter Baker & Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa is absolutely pure. It 
contains no trace of any substance foreign to the pure roasted cocoa-bean. The color 
is that of pure cocoa. The flavor is natural, and not artificial; and the product is in 
every particular such as must have been produced from the pure cocoa-bean without 
the addition of any chemical, alkali, acid, or artificial flavoring substance which are to 
be detected in cocoas prepared by the so-called " Dutch process."
