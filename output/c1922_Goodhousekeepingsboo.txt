How To Use The Recipes 

In every case, use accurate and level measurements. Always 
sift flour once before measuring, then at least once again 
with the other dry ingredients. In cake, cooky, and muffin 
recipes calling for butter, any good margarin may be used. 
Unsalted vegetable fats are also very satisfactory as butter 
substitutes because of their neutral flavor. If these are used, 
however, be sure to increase the amount of salt which the 
recipe calls for. In most cases, the salt may be doubled. 
Sugar designated means granulated unless otherwise stated. 

When baking bread, biscuits, muffins, corn cake, etc., the 
pans should be well greased. For all butter cakes both grease 
and flour pans. Angel and true sponge cakes should be 
baked in ungreased pans. The time given for baking can 
only be approximate as the depth of the pan used will make 
a slight difference. 

Each recipe is planned to serve six unless otherwise stated. 
This, too, can only be approximate as the accompanying dishes 
will have some bearing on the size of the servings in many 
cases. 



Measuring and Mixing 

Half of the secret of good cooking lies in accurate meas- 
urement. GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE recommends a 
standard measuring-set. First in its list of measuring-utensils 
are two standard measuring-cups holding one-half pint each 
and divided into quarters and thirds. These may be made 
of either aluminum or glassware. The tin cup is too short- 
lived. A set of accurate measuring-spoons is essential. 
These are made of aluminum and can be found in capacities 
graduated from one tablespoonful down to one-fourth tea- 
spoonful. They assure uniform good results in baking-pow- 
der mixtures, cakes, and so forth, as well as careful seasoning. 

A small spatula for the leveling of all solid measurements 
is indispensable. An aluminum quart measure and a small 
compact spring scale may also be added to the measuring 
equipment. Use the scale more for checking the weights as 
purchased than for cooking by weight. A spring scale, while 
illegal in certain states because it can be easily tampered 
with, is nevertheless practical and accurate for household 
usage. 

In all measuring see that the ingredients are level. A 
cupful is measured level; a tablespoonful is measured level; 
a teaspoonful is measured level. In measuring dry ingredi- 
ents by cupfuls fill the cup by tablespoonfuls, allow it to 
heap slightly, then level with a quick stroke of the spatula. 
When fractions of a cupful are to be measured, measure by 
tablespoonfuls in preference to the use of the cup up to one- 
half cup capacity, remembering that sixteen tablespoonfula 
are equal to one cupful. And do not shake the cup while 
filling. 

To Measure Dry Ingredients 

In measuring dry ingredients by spoonfuls fill the spoon 
by dipping into the ingredient until more than level; level

with the spatula, cutting with the edge of the knife toward 
the tip of the spoon. For the half-teaspoonful, measure 
in exactly the same way, using the measuring spoon of 
one-half teaspoonful capacity. For the half-tablespoonful 
nse the spoons of one teaspoonful and one-half teaspoonful 
capacity. For one-eighth of a teaspoonful measure one- 
fourth teaspoonful as usual, then cut sharply in two with the 
spatula. Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is called a 
" speck'* or "a few grains' 7 and is the amount which can 
be taken up on the very tip end of a vegetable knife. This 
is a term quite frequently used for seasoning. 

In measuring a solid fat, pack solidly into cup or spoon 
and cut level with the spatula. When one-quarter cupful or 
less of a fat is desired always measure in tablespoonfuls, al- 
lowing four tablespoonfuls to each quarter cupful. Here is 
a simple way of measuring fats when less than one cupful is 
desired. If, for instance, one-half cupful of fat is desired, 
fill the measuring cup with one-half cupful of water and then 
add the fat in small pieces until the water reaches the cup- 
ful mark ; then pour off the water and one-half cupful of fat 
will remain. 

To Measure Liquids 

In measuring liquids by cupfuls pour the liquid to be meas- 
ured into the cup, filling it to the very top of the standard 
cup. For fractions of cupfuls fill in like manner to the indi- 
cated division. In the same way measure liquids by spoon- 
fuls, by taking up all the spoon will hold. 

Just How to Mix 

Fully as important as measuring is the correct motion for 
combining ingredients. These involve three processes, stir- 
ring, beating, and "cutting" or folding in. The stirring mo- 
tion is required to blend ingredients together. It is the one 
that is most often employed for thoroughly mixing the in- 
gredients of a dish. 

Beating is the motion necessary when air must be intro- 
duced into a mixture in order to leaven it. In beating, the 
ingredients must be turned over and over, continually bring- 
ing the under part upward to the surface and consequently 
bringing with it, with each stroke, a certain amount of air. 



RECIPES AND HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 9 

The cutting and folding motion is necessary when a mix- 
ture already containing entrapped air introduced by beat- 
ing must hare added to it an ingredient, also well beaten, 
and the mixing accomplished without loss of air from either 
mixture. The best illustration of this is a sponge cake where, 
into the light yolk-sugar-and-flour mixture, must be cut and 
folded the beaten egg-whites. 

Briefly, by stirring, a dish is properly mixed; by beating, 
air is entrapped in the mixture ; by cutting and folding, this 
air which has been already entrapped is prevented from 
escaping. 



The following lists of equivalents are intended merely as 
an assistance in purchasing supplies, because GOOD HOUSE- 
KEEPING INSTITUTE does not believe in cookery by weight. 



EQUIVALENTS OF CAPACITY 

(All measures level full) 



16 tablespoonfuls = 

% gSd pint 
8 fluid ounces = 

16 



LIQUID MEASURE DRY MEASURE 

4 fluid ounces = 1 gill (For fruits, vegetables, and 
4 gills = 1 pint other dry commodities) 

2 pints 1 quart 2 pints = 1 quart 

4 quarts ~ 1 gallon 8 quarts = 1 peck 

2 gallons sss 1 barrel 4 pecks = 1 bushel 

2 barrels s== 1 hogshead 105 quarts = 1 barrel 

The pint and quart dry measures are about 16% larger than 
the pint and quart liquid measures.

SOFT CUSTARD DE LUXE 



2 eggs % teaspoonful salt 

2 egg-yolks 3 cupfuls scalded milk 

% cupful sugar 1 teaspoonful vanilla 

Place the eggs and the egg-yolks in a bowl and beat slightly^ 
just enough to mix the eggs together, and then add the sugar 
and salt. Beat only enough to blend the eggs and sugar 
together. Over this, pour the scalded milk gradually, stirring 
all the while. Return to the double-boiler in which the milk 
was scalded and cook for about five minutes until the 
mixture thickens sufficiently to coat the spoon with which it 
is being stirred. The stirring should be continuous during 
the cooking. Do not allow the water in the double-boiler to 
boil violently during the cooking; the custard is much 
smoother if cooked slowly. Be careful not to cook too long, 
or the custard will curdle. If this should happen, remove it 
from the fire immediately and beat with a Dover type egg- 
beater until smooth. Avoid overcooking, however, because a 
custard that has once curdled will never have just the same 
consistency as one that has been cooked just right. When 
the custard is cold, add the vanilla, mix well together and 
chill thoroughly before serving. The rest of the egg-whites 
may be used for meringue in the making of Floating Island 
or fruit custard desserts. Good Housekeeping Institute

Pepper pickles 

Paprika 

Six ribs from each side of a rack of pork are required for 
this dish, and each rib should be trimmed in the same way 
that lamb chops are cut when Frenched, only the ribs are 
not separated. Then the sections of meat are turned so that 
the bones are on the outside, and fastened together in a circle 
with skewers and string. Next make a stuffing. Soak the 
bread-crumbs in cold water and squeeze dry. Mix with the 
walnut-meats chopped, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one-fourth teaspoonful of 
paprika and the summer savory. Place the stuffing in the 
center of the roast and cover the ends of the bones with 
greased papers to prevent their browning too soon. Put the 
meat in a 500 F. oven and cook for thirty minutes. Then 
lower the heat to 450 F. and finish the roasting. Two hours 
should be given the roast perhaps a little longer if it is very 
meaty, for it must be well done and during the roasting 
process it must be basted frequently with the dripping in the 
pan, to which a cupful of boiling water was added after the 
roast was nicely seared. Sprinkle the meat lightly with salt

it soft and tender. Make the gravy, from part of the fat 
in the pan, adding the cider to it. Serve the pig on a bed 
of parsley. Decorate as preferred, the customary garnishing 
being a lemon in its mouth, cranberry eyes, and a wreath of 
parsley about its neck. A paper chop frill on the tail gives

Boiling water 3 blades mace 

Vinegar 1 ounce mustard-seed 

4 green peppers 2 bay-leaves 

1 good-sized onion 

Be careful not to bruise or mar the cucumbers. Do not wash 
and scrub them unless absolutely necessary, as that will tend 
to bruise them. Select very small prickly cucumbers of uni- 
form size and cover them with cold water. By measuring the 
cold water needed for covering the pickles at this stage, the 
amount needed for the brine and also for the vinegar later 
on may be easily determined. Let stand one hour, then lift 
the cucumbers out in order not to disturb any settling of sand 
or dirt, and turn them into a large crock. Add one cupful of 
salt to sufficient boiling water to cover the cucumbers and 
pour this over them. Cover the crock closely and let it stand 
for two days. After this, drain, rejecting those that may

A NEW USE FOE SANDPAPER 

I saw a painter put a small piece of sandpaper under each end 
of a heavy frame when standing it on a narrow ledge. I tried 
the same thing when a large mirror was inclined to slip for- 
ward from its resting place on a mantel, and found it success- 
ful. The folds of sandpaper were so small that they did not 
show, and the mirror did not move again. 

Mrs. G. L. 8., Cal. 

BLOTTERS FOB THE EMERGENCY 

I keep a pack of large, plain, white blotters in the drawer of 
my sideboard, and when anything is spilled on the dining- 
room linen, instead of reaching for a freshly laundered napkin 
to sop it up with, I reach at once for one of the blotters, and 
the spilled liquid is absorbed immediately instead of being 
made larger by useless sopping. This simple process saves 
considerable time in laundering, because if it happens that 
milk or water has been overturned, the blotter takes up the 
moisture so quickly and thoroughly that the accident may 
often pass entirely unnoticed, and the linen may be used 
several times more. On the other hand, if the stain is of fruit 
or coffee, the blotter system is equally efficient in that what 
there is of the spot is much smaller in area, so that there is 
less linen to be rubbed and scalded. P. W., N. Y. 

CARE IN USING ELECTRICITY 

Now that electrical devices of all kinds are so constantly 
used, many women forget that certain precautions must be 
taken in their use. Never turn electricity on or off when you 
are standing on a wet or even damp floor. If you do so, the 
current is apt to pass through your body. This advice is 
particularly applicable to the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry 
where water is most likely to be spilled. Mrs J. T. t N. Y.

FOR PERSONS WEARING BIFOCAL GLASSES 

For the benefit of those who wear bifocals, I suggest the

THE YOUNGSTER'S HIGH CHAIR 

When our small son reached the age when he was large enough 
to eat at the table with us, we had to meet the problem of 
how to make his chair the proper height, for the "baby high 
chair" which he had been using up to that time did not look 
at all well in our Sheraton dining-room suite, and we were 
much opposed to the usual sofa cushion or big book placed 
daily on his chair. This is how we finally remedied the diffi- 
culty : We purchased four of the old-fashioned door bumpers, 
the sort with the hard rubber pad in the end, and screwed one 
in the end of each leg of Sonny's chair. This gave the re- 
quired rise of quite three inches, and when they were stained 
mahogany color, they were almost invisible. In this way we 
had a thoroughly satisfactory high chair which stood with 
all the rest without spoiling the looks of our dining-room.

To RENEW WHITE WINDOW SHADES 

While having my bathroom enameled, I remarked to the 
painter that I should be most happy to discover some way of 
making the white window shades fresh and clean again, as 
they had become soiled from long use. Immediately he came 
to my rescue, removed the shades, took them out into the 
garage, and hung them against the wall. Then he gave the 
shades a coat of flat white paint, and when they were dry, he 
put green paint on the other side, and now the shades look 
like new. D. W. D., Mich. 

EDITOR'S NOTE. This discovery was tested in the Institute 
and found to be very practical. 

To RENOVATE A DAVENPORT 

We have a wicker and tapestry davenport which had become

To SAVE THE FURNITURE 

When our baby got her first kiddy car, the furniture received 
manv scratches. My husband then tacked a piece of rubber 
tubing around the front and back of the kiddy car, using as 
few tacks as possible. Since then, the furniture has been 
bumped but unharmed. The tubing also acts as a shock ab- 
sorber and saves our baby many tumbles and jolts.

WHEN ADDING EXTRA LEAVES TO A TABLE 

After adding extra leaves to the dining-room table, all house- 
keepers know the inconvenience of having to open one table- 
cloth after another to find one of the right length for the

on the narrow hem, making very small letters and using white 
embroidery cotton. E. 8. L., N. J.

A LAUNDRY BAG 

The most satisfactory laundry bag I ever had I made from a 
yard of thirty-six-inch cretonne. I folded it lengthwise and 
shaped it at the top so as to fit over a coat hanger. On the 
front side, I cut a slit long enough to push the soiled clothes 
through, and bound it firmly. Then I cut the back side of the 
bag longer, enough to enable me to turn it up at the bottom 
for a flap, which I fastened on the front side with five large 
snap fasteners. With a bag made in this way, the bottom 
can be unsnapped and the laundry dropped out without 
removing the bag from the hook on the closet door.

AN IRONING GARMENT 

Pin a Turkish towel around the left end of your ironing board. 
You will come upon many bits of work in the course of an 
hour's ironing that will repay you for the effort. Initials, 
some laces, and heavy seams look a hundred percent better 
when ironed over Turkish towels. Mrs. E. $., N. T. 

A NOVEL CLOTHES BASKET 

One of the best discoveries I ever made came about when at 
a summer cottage. There was washing to do and no clothes 
basket until we discovered a bushel basket such as farmers use 
about a farm. Such a basket proved easy to lift when full of 
wet clothes, and when the laundry basket in my city home 
needed to be renewed, I went to a grocery store where such 
articles are sold, and bought three of the bushel baskets. My 
laundress speaks of the convenience of having three baskets to 
sort clothes in. Furthermore, one basket can be left in the 
clothes yard after the first wash is hung out, and is there 
ready for them when dry, while there are still wet clothes in 
the other two baskets. G. B. H. t la.

AVOID Loss OF HANDKERCHIEFS 

In sending handkerchiefs to the laundry, in order to avoid the 
loss of handkerchiefs and of temper as well, I baste them 
on a long tape, usually two together, and up to the present 
time have not been obliged to make one complaint with regard 
to the loss or tearing of handkerchiefs. Of course, they are 
returned unironed, but who would not be willing to press them 
out rather than not to have them returned to you at all, par- 
ticularly in these days of high-priced linen !

BRIDGE TABLE COVERS EASILY WASHED 

It always proved a tedious task to wash my bridge table covers 
because of the many tapes attached to them, used in keeping 
the covers in place on the table. Now I have dispensed with 
the tapes entirely and simplified the washing of the covers by 
making a tiny, square pocket on the under side of each corner, 
fastened with a snap. In each pocket I place a weight, which 
keeps the cover in position and can be slipped out when the 
cover is laundered. Mrs. L. H. N., N. 7. 

DOLLS' CLOTHES-PINS SOLVE THE PROBLEM 

Dolls' clothes-pins have proved very useful in hanging the 
baby's clothes on a cord across the upstairs piazza. The big 
pins fall out, and safety-pins are very apt to tear the clothes.

DRYING WOOLEN SWEATERS 

Heavy woolen sweaters may be dried most successfully in the 
following way : Lay a clean sheet kept just for the purpose 
over a window screen. On this place the washed sweater in 
exactly its original form, carefully placing the fulness in the 
front, with a flat back. Balance the screen on two chairs and 



232 GOOD HOUSEKEEPING'S BOOK OF MENUS 

dry the sweater over a floor register or in a warm room in the 
winter time, or in a shady place out-of-doors if it is summer. 

Miss M. A., N. J. 

HANGING CLOTHES IN COLD WEATHER 

In cold weather I place my clothes-pins in a pan in the 
warming oven. When I am ready to hang out the washing, I 
put the hot clothes-pins in the clothes-pin bag. Each time I 
reach for a pin, my fingers get warm, and the hot clothes-pins 
also help to keep the corners from freezing too much in hang- 
ing the clothes straight. Mrs. B. A. D., Utah. 

How I SPRINKLE MY CLOTHES 

I sprinkle my clothes with boiling water and one of the round 
variety of vegetable brushes. This distributes the water in 
fine drops and prevents me from burning my fingers, and the 
clothes can be ironed in fifteen minutes. 

Mrs. E. r. Ohio. 



KEEPING THE IRONING BOARD CLEAN 

It is surprising how much dust can collect on an ironing board 
cover when it is not in use. To avoid this very thing, I have 
made a cotton bag into which the ironing board can be 
slipped after each time of using. This bag is long enough 
to fold over at the top and thus protects the board from dirt 
and dust. Miss M. A., N. J. 

REMOVABLE COVERS FOR HOLDERS 

I find ironing holders, and in fact all holders, are bound to 
get soiled when used for any great length of time, and it is 
not an easy task to wash and dry them when they are so thick. 
To ease the washing of the same, I make the foundation pads 
of the usual size and shape. Then I make slip-covers of the 
same size as the pads, having short tapes on the edges. These 
covers slip over the pads easily, being tied in position. When 
soiled, the covers alone are removed and washed. Gingham, 
percale, or something firm and washable is satisfactory for the 
covers. Mrs. T. W. B., Conn.

SAVING STRENGTH ON WASH DAY 

"When wash day comes around, I use the children's wagon 
to haul the wash basket of wet clothes from the back door or 
laundry to the clothes-line. It not only saves me a heavy 
load, but it also prevents dragging the larger pieces of the 
wash on the ground while they are being hung up, because 
the wagon can be drawn along right under the clothes-line. 
When there is snow, the children's sled answers equally as 
well. Mrs. R. B. C., Ind. 

To IRON BABY PILLOW COVERS 

Our baby had several lovely carriage pillow covers given to 
him, which we found difficult to launder well. No matter 
how carefully they were ironed, the madeira embroidery 
looked a bit pulled, until we made a special ironing board 
to fit the pillows. All the pillow covers were regulation size 
for baby pillows, 17" by 13". We took the cover of a packing 
box and had it sawed slightly smaller than the pillow covers, 
so it could easily be slipped in and out. This we covered as 
one does a full-sized ironing board. Now the covers look 
better than new, when ironed. Mrs. W. K. t III. 



To KTTPTP CURTAINS CLEAN 

To any one living in a smoky city, the problem of keeping the 
curtains clean is a difficult one. In my apartment I have 
solved the difficulty by having all my curtains of the same 
material and made identically the same, always keeping on 
hand one extra pair of curtains. Each week I put the pair of 
curtains which is soiled the most into the wash, hanging up 
the extra pair in its place. To simplify the laundering, I have 
two extra curtain rods in the laundry, each of which is six 
feet long, or over twice the width of one curtain. After wash- 
ing, the curtains are stretched by hanging from one rod while 
the other is run through the bottom hems. In this way, the 
curtains dry easily, and by following the above plan my cur- 
tains are always clean and unwrinkled, my windows are never 
bare, and there is no extra labor involved in laundering the 
curtains. This method 'of drying the curtains is adapted to 
those made of net or filet. Mrs. B. E. J., III.

To KKEP THE BEDROOM CURTAINS CLEAN 

Just how to keep the bedroom curtains from getting soiled 
and mussed at night when the windows are wide open was, 
until recently, a great problem to me, but I have at last hit 
upon a simple plan. Buy spring clothes-pins in any depart- 
ment store. Two are needed for each window. Catch the 
outside and inside edges of both white curtain and cretonne 
drapery together, lift these to the highest point that can be 
reached along the outside of the curtain, and snap all together 
with a clothes-pin. It is surprising how fresh and clean the 
curtains will keep when you follow this procedure.

To TTrorp THE IRON FROM STICKING 

If, when making starch, you use soapy water as the founda- 
tion, you will have no further trouble with the iron sticking 
to the article you are laundering. Allow one tablespoonf ul of 
soap jelly to each quart of water, adding the desired amount 
of starch, depending upon the garments to be starched.

To WASH HEAVY RAG RUGS 

I have found a simple way of washing heavy rag rugs. Soak 
the rugs for five minutes in cold water, then spread them on

dipped in hot water. Rinse thoroughly in clear water in the 
laundry tub and hang on the line to dry.

To WASH TRICOLETTE BLOUSES 

I have a light tricolette blouse which must be laundered often. 
I found it difficult to iron it nicely after frequent washings. 
Now I simply hang the blouse on a clean wooden rod, then tie 
the rod to the clothes-line by means of a stout string. In the 
winter months I place the rod over the back of two chairs. In 
this manner the blouse dries smoothly and requires no ironing.

To WASH WOOL STOCKINGS 

Every one wearing wool stockings has more or less qualms in 
washing them because of the possibility of their shrinking. 
Not having any stocking stretchers I have hit upon a plan that 
is indeed a discovery. Before drying the stockings I put shoe 
trees in the feet, and this not only keeps them from shrinking, 
but makes them more comfortable when worn again.

WHEN STARCHING CLOTHES 

In doing the washing for my family in our electric washing- 
machine, I found that the starching of from forty to sixty 
garments and pieces of household linen was the most tedious 
and disagreeable part of the whole undertaking. Almost im- 
mediately I happened upon this plan which has proved a real 
time-saver. I make about three-quarters of a gallon of starch. 
When all the washing is finished and the clothes have been 
rinsed and wrung dry, I put about half of the pieces to be 
starched, shaken out lightly, into one of the stationary tubs. 
I pour half of the hot starch over them and wring them one 
by one through the power wringer, the top ones first. As 
the starch drips off the wringer board, I hold the next piece 
under to catch it, occasionally sopping the starch out of the 
corners of the tub also, and then repeating the operation till 
all the clothes are wrung through. Then I put the rest of the 
pieces in the tub and pour the balance of the starch over them, 
repeating the wringing process. The starch is evenly dis- 
tributed through the clothes, and I have no trouble with lumps 
when ironing them. If any piece is desired very stiff, it can 
be dipped in the starch first. Mrs. J. T. H., Md. 

WHEN WASHING CURTAINS 

Net curtains that are hung with a rod both at the top and the 
bottom do not need to be ironed or stretched. Launder them 
in the usual way and hang on the rods wet. The curtains dry 
smoothly, with edges that are even and straight. If there is 
a top heading, pinch it up with your fingers when about half 
dry. The heading will stand up in nice plaits.

put through the food-chopper, using the medium cutter first, 
and then the fine cutter. To one cupful of this granulated 
soap add one and one-half cupfuls of corn-meal and put 
through the food-chopper again until reduced to a coarse 
meal. This may be facilitated by rubbing between the hands 
to loosen the particles. When all will pass readily through 
a meal sieve, add one ounce of olive oil to each two and one- 
half cupfuls of the soap and corn-meal mixture. Blend thor- 
oughly. An ordinary fruit jar with the rubber ring in place 
makes a good container. A quantity of this soap powder kept 
on the kitchen sink or in the bathroom will be found invalu-

ONE MORE SHORT CUT TO CLEANLINESS 

During the out-of-door season, my soul is often tried by my 
mud-loving sons trailing muddy foot-marks and quarts of sand 
over the bathroom, especially when I am doing all my own 
housework. The white-tiled walls, floors, basin, and tub all 
show their tracks even after one bath ! Not so any more, for 
recently I made a discovery. I now keep a bath mat, a cake 
of soap, two bath towels, and two wash-cloths in my laundry. 
Every day, or oftener, my sons are led to the cool laundry 
and bathed in my laundry tubs, which are porcelain and as 
clean and as easily kept so as the bathtub. The tubs are at a 
convenient height for mother to help with the "corners," and 
that means a lot of backaches avoided, as any five-foot mother 
of two wriggling boys can testify, after she has doubled her- 
self over the bathtub in the attitude of a measuring worm for 
half an hour a day. One more bit of saving this discovery 
has, and that is that the muddy, sandy garments that are 
stripped off the youngsters are right where they should be, 
ready to be washed. Mrs. N. W. F., N. T. 

RESCUE THE BATH TOWELS 

In a household of men and boys addicted to hard rubbing 
after cold showers, I have found that the life of heavy bath 
towels may be lengthened considerably by binding with one- 
inch tape all along the two sides where the first fatal breaks 
always seem to appear. A loop of tape in the middle of one 
side to slip over a nickeled hook on the bathroom door may 
suggest to the hurried youth a better way of disposing of a 
wet towel than leaving it on the floor or folding it when wet. 

Mrs. T. R. H., Pa. 

SOFT TOWELS FOR LITTLE ONES 

1 find that excellent towels for infants and small children can 
be made from birdseye cloth. Turn an inch hem and then 
stitch across this a narrow strip of light blue or pink cham- 
bray. These towels are easily kept white and are very ab- 
sorbent. Mrs. W. R. M., Okla. 



Bed-Room Discoveries 

A CHILD'S BEDSPREAD 

A spread that will help entertain a sick child can be ikdde of 
blue galatea or solid-colored gingham. Make the spread any 
desired size; then pull apart the pages of a linen story book 
and stitch these on the spread, leaving spaces between the 
various pages. I have known a child to be entertained for 
an hour at a time with this spread. Mrs. C. P. P., Tex. 

A CROCHET HOOK FOR THE EMERGENCY 

A crochet hook is a useful adjunct to the sewing basket or to 
the dressing-table equipment. When the end of a drawstring 
or tape disappears within its casing, insert the hook and 
quickly draw it out. A. J. D., Mass. 

AN IMPROVISED DRESSING-TABLE CHAIR 

1 feel that I have rescued and found a place for the old- 
fashioned piano-stool that swung around at our will for so 
many years, but has gradually given way to the more artistic 
bench. There is no better chair than the piano-stool for a 
dressing-table chair. One can swing all the way around on 
it and see how one 's hair looks in the back, or one 's collar or 
hat. It really is a very practical help in seeing the imprac- 
tical things, and dressed up in chintz or brocade, it looks 
very smart. C. D., N. Y. 

COVERING BABY 

As cold weather is with us again, it may lighten the burden of 
some mothers to know that the baby may be kept covered at 
night and saved from many colds by the use of two large 
horse-blanket pins. These may be bought at any of the de- 
partment stores. Pin through the bedclothes to the mattress 
on both sides, and it will be impossible for the baby to kick off 
the covers. Mrs. F. S. C., N. J.

FOB COAT HANGERS 

My dresses, coats, and sweaters often slip off the wooden 
hangers. Recently I purchased large-sized, rubber-tipped 
tacks at a hardware shop. I pushed one of these tacks in at 
each end of the hanger. This keeps the hanging articles from 
slipping off, and yet leaves no mark or bulge. This method 
is especially good for careless children whose clothes are con- 
tinually slipping to the floor. Mrs. M. L., Pa. 

SHEETS BY SIZE 

I have always been bothered by not knowing what size my 
sheets were when they came out of the laundry or the closet. 
I have now one less thing to worry me, for each sheet is 
marked so that I know at once whether it is narrow, medium, 
or wide. With a tape measure I measured every sheet I 
owned, and sorted them into three piles narrow, medium, 
and wide. I left the narrow sheets unmarked. I marked the 
medium sheets with one cross in red marking cotton over the 
edge of the narrow hem, and I marked the wide sheets with 
two crosses in the same place. My sheets are now in three 
piles in my linen closet, and I know exactly what size sheet 
I am getting when I take one from the closet. What is more 
important, I can tell at a glance which pile the sheet belongs 
to, after it has been laundered. K. C. C., Mass. 



To FOLD A BEDSPREAD 

To keep the bedspread from wrinkling during the night, I 
always fold it in the following manner rather than throwing 
it over the foot of the bed in the usual way : Begin at the top 
of the spread and fold it toward the foot'm half. Then fold 
from each side toward the center, forming a triangle, the 
point of which is toward the head and the base toward the 
foot of the bed. Hold the point and fold it over the foot- 
board. The spread does not drag on the floor or lose its posi- 
tion. To unfold, follow in reverse order. I have used this 
method all summer, and my bedspreads are not unnecessarily 
soiled or wrinkled. Mrs. F. B. C., N. J.

A DELICIOUS LUNCHEON BISCUIT 

For the luncheon or afternoon tea service, the following sug- 
gests a dainty biscuit. Make the ordinary baking-powder bis- 
cuit dough and roll it to one-quarter inch thickness. Cut with 
a medium-sized biscuit cutter and spread each biscuit thickly 
with a deviled ham mixture. Boll up and bake as usual.

AN EMERGENCY DESSERT 

An excellent dessert may always be quickly prepared if one 
has ripe, mealy apples on hand. Peel and core the apples, 
then chop them rather coarsely. Serve at once in sherbet 
glasses with plenty of powdered sugar and thick cream either 
plain or whipped. Lemon juice may be sprinkled over the 
apples if one favors such an addition. M. M. H., Cal. 

APPLE SAUCE IN DISGUISE 

I have discovered that green apples or any apples which are 
rather colorless and tasteless can be made into delicious apple 
sauce by the addition of red cinnamon drops. Add the cin- 
namon drops when starting to cook the apples, and by the time 
the apple sauce is done, the cinnamon drops will have im- 
parted a delicate color and a cinnamon flavor which is most 
pleasing. Add sugar to taste, in the usual manner.

BAKING SQUASH 

I used to have sad times preparing my Hubbard squash for 
the kettle or oven, often being obliged to call on the ax to 
help me, and generally winding up with at least one dis- 
abled member. Now, immediately after breakfast, I just wash

the squash and place it in the range oven. By dinner-time 
it is baked; then I open it with any common knife, remove 
the seeds, scrape out the squash, and with the addition of a 
little cream and seasoning I have the most delicious squash 
imaginable, for all its sweet juices have been retained and 
so has my temper ! 0. D. B., la. 

CUSTARD DATE PIE 

When making your next custard pie, lend variety to its flavor 
by the addition of dates. Stone the dates and cut them in 
small pieces, allowing one-half cupful to the standard recipe 
for one pie. Add the dates to the custard mixture and pour 
into the pastry -lined pie-plate. Bake in the usual manner, 
and the result will be truly delicious. Mrs. J. W. E., S. D. 

DRYING HERBS 

When drying celery, parsley, or sage for winter seasonings, 
I leave all the leaves on and cut the stalks short enough so 
that they will fit in preserve jars. Then I place them in the 
uncovered jars with the leaves down and dry them in the 
oven. Then I adjust the rubbers and covers and store them 
away. Dried in this way, the herbs are particularly nice, as 
you can crumble them as you need them, some things requiring 
finer particles than others. D. M. B., N. Y. 

MANY WAYS WITH CHILI SAUCE 

More times than once my store of canned chili sauce comes to 
the rescue. When I wish to bake beans and have no salt pork 
on hand, I empty a jar of my chili sauce over the beans. If 1 
want a vegetable flavor in a small pot roast or a brown stew, 
I add chili sauce when making the gravy. For a sandwich 
filling I put through the meat-chopper any cold meat that I 
have on hand and then mix it with enough chili sauce to make 
a good paste to spread on the bread. D. M. B., N. Y. 

MAPLE FROSTING 

A very easy and very delicious frosting for cake is made by

MASHED POTATOES OF A NEW FLAVOR 

When preparing mashed potatoes, season them in the usual 
way with salt, pepper, and butter, then add onion juice and 
grated nutmeg, allowing one teaspoonful of onion juice and 
one-quarter teaspoonful of grated nutmeg to each quart of 
mashed potatoes. It is surprising how this little addition lifts 
this familiar dish out of the ranks of the commonplace. 

Mrs. L. A. C., Mass. 

MINT GRAPEFRUIT 

When serving grapefruit, it often whets the appetite to pre- 
pare it in a variety of ways. One of our favorite combina- 
tions is grapefruit and mint. Prepare the grapefruit in the 
usual manner, removing the tough portion in the center and 
separating the pulp from the skin around the entire circum- 
ference. Place one after-dinner mint in the center of each 
prepared half -grapefruit, chill thoroughly, and serve. This 
combination is particularly good for the dessert course. 

Mrs. R. W. S., Kan. 

POP-CORN AND BANANA SALAD 

When making banana salad, try substituting pop-corn in 
place of the walnuts or peanuts that are usually used. Cut 
the bananas in halves lengthwise and place on lettuce leaves. 
Decorate with salad dressing and pop-corn. The result is very 
artistic and economical. E. Q., Que. 

KICED CARROTS 

Endeavoring to think of some novel way of varying the usual 
buttered carrots, an inspiration was the result. I scraped and 
cooked the carrots in the usual manner, and when tender, I 
drained them and put them through the fine sieve of a potato- 
ricer. With plenty of butter, the proper seasonings of salt, 
pepper, and paprika, and a vigorous beating, I had a de- 
lightfully tasty vegetable. Miss M. L. A., N. J. 

To LIGHT THE CHRISTMAS PUDDING

flames. And there is no need of giving up this pleasing rite, 
for my mother always used common lemon extract for pro- 
ducing the flame. Lemon extract contains a liberal amount 
of alcohol, so that it burns readily and has a delightful aroma. 
Try it ! Mrs. J. L. H., Va. 

To SERVE EGGS ON TOAST 

When serving eggs on toast to children or invalids, cut the 
toast in small cubes, leaving the slice in its original shape, 
before putting on the eggs. Then the toast is very easily eaten 
by the child or invalid. Mrs. T. J. McA., Mass. 

WHEN MAKING COOKIES 

When making rolled cookies which call for soda, you will find 
it much easier to mix the dough the night before. Then mold 
the dough into a long, slender roll and let stand in the refrig- 
erator or a cold place overnight. In the morning slice the roll 
into thin slices and bake the cookies at the usual temperature. 
This method saves a great deal of time which is generally nec- 
essary for rolling out and cutting the cookies.

Discoveries Concerning Children 

A MILK SODA 

Winifred was one of the little girls who would not drink milk, 
regardless of her mother's efforts. Her aversion seemed so 
great that mother finally stopped insisting. Then Winifred 
started to school. She immediately began asking for two 
pennies each day for recess lunch, which consisted of crackers 
and a glass of milk. Her mother was astounded, also elated, 
and asked why she wanted milk at school but refused it at 
home. Winifred's answer solved the question, "Well, mother, 
at school we drink it through a straw, and I can't smell it." 

Mrs. A. E., Ind. 

CHILD TRAINING IN COOKERY 

Would you help your child and yourself at the same time? 
Then next baking day, when your child begs to help, let him 
help. The usual excuse the child receives is that the mother 
is too busy and can't be bothered. I thought I would give 
my children the chance really to cook, and what is the result ? 
On baking day I can turn part, or the whole of my baking 
over to my fourteen-year-old son and my eleven-year-old 
daughter. They can cook equally well and take great pride 
in what they do. I do not ask them to do too much, just enough 
so they are always desirous of doing more. 

Mrs. C. E. P., Mass. 

DOMINOES, A CHILD'S TEACHER 

We find playing dominoes a great help to the children in their 
school work, making them quick and accurate in addition from 
much practise. It also serves to keep them quietly occupied 
on rainy days and at odd minutes. We adults often take a 
hand. The children began at quite an early age with the usual 
set, which runs to double six; they might have begun earlier 

244 



RECIPES AND HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 245 

still if we had taken out the higher numbers and stopped at 
double four. We start the game with the double blank and 
play in four directions, thus having four ends to count. At 
present we are playing with a set that goes to double twelve, 
and later we shall have one that runs up to double fifteen. 
These larger sets make a good joint Christmas gift to the chil- 
dren of a family and are usually a good deal of a surprise, so 
few people know of their existence. Mrs. G. H. S., N. J. 

DRINKING MILK THE KIDDIE'S WAY 

Perhaps your child will not drink his milk. Perhaps you are 
to blame for placing a large glass of milk before him and 
bidding him " drink it all" ! There is a better way. A small 
pitcher and a little, flat-bottomed wine glass will do the trick. 
Pour a little milk at a time from the pitcher into the tiny 
glass and watch your child delight in taking every drop. If 
the child is old enough, let him pour it himself. This is a 
healthful method, for the milk will never be taken in large 
gulps. Mrs. E. C. J., El. 

EATING CEREALS 

My two little girls refused to eat cereals until recently, when 
it occurred to me to give them each a little sugar bowl and 
pitcher so that they might help themselves. As the pitcher 
and sugar bowl hold only enough for one serving, there is no 
waste or over-sweetening. Besides teaching them to wait on 
themselves without spilling, they are getting the benefit of 
wholesome cereals for breakfast and learning to like them.

FAVORS FOR A CHILD'S PARTY 

How the children love my edible Red Riding Hoods, because 
they are something different! For each Red Riding Hood a 
marshmallow, a toothpick, a small bar of chocolate, and red

the marshmallow for a neck and through the chocolate bar 
for the body. Now make a little red dress and cape and stand 
a Red Riding Hood at each child's place.

FOR CONVALESCENT CHILDREN 

If a mother finds it hard to find amusement for convalescent 
children, I wish she would try a handful of toothpicks with a 
little pan of puffed wheat or puffed rice. My four little ones 
had mumps one after another, and after watching the first, 
when he was able to sit up in bed, make so many interesting 
things with the toothpicks and wheat, I really believe they 
were rather anxious to be just sick enough to play with them.

GLYCERIN SOAP BUBBLES 

Having two small sisters, I am often called on, in case of their 
illness, to help entertain them. And I have at last found a 
sure way of keeping them contented and happy when they are 
well enough to permit it. I place a woolen blanket on top 
of the bed coverings and provide each child with a clay pipe. 
Then I prepare a cupful of real soapsuds, adding to it a small 
amount of glycerin. The children can blow bubbles to their 
hearts' content, and the glycerin makes the bubbles tough so 
that they settle on the blankets and often remain four or five 
minutes before breaking. D. McC., la. 

INTEREST IN HEALTH 

In the school my children attend there are no school nurses, 
nutrition classes, etc., but I tell them what is being done in 
other schools along health lines, and we try to carry out some 
of these principles, chief of which are weighing and measur- 
ing. I give each a weight chart that they may see for them- 
selves what they should weigh, impress upon them the value 
of proper food and plenty of sleep, and once a month take 
them to the scales. They are quite interested in observing 
their progress and are not nearly so indifferent regarding 
meals as they were before I had them keep their own records.

NEATNESS AS A VIRTUE 

I had noticed so many young girls who were either dowdy 
looking or overdressed that I resolved that my girls should 
not be in cither clasa when in their teens if I could help it. I

began their training by teaching them the value of matching 
colors between hair ribbons and dresses. Now my seven-year- 
old girl selects the ribbons for her dresses, never making the 
mistake of choosing a varicolored, Roman-striped hair rib- 
bon to accompany a plaid dress, but instead selecting a black 
one or one matching the predominating color of the plaid. 
She has many colored handkerchiefs, and we have serious 
talks about selecting the proper color for the proper dress. 
She has a miniature manicure set just like mother's and takes 
great pride in its use, which results in clean nails of suitable 
length. This may sound unnecessary to many mothers, but 
I am looking forward to the future, when I hope to reap my 
reward in seeing a well-dressed girl who will not be conspicu- 
ous for untidiness or loud dressing. Mrs. A. S., Mass. 

REMEDYING TIME WASTERS 

There have been two small things in my family of three little 
girls that have caused more petty annoyance than all the big 
tasks put together. These were heralded in my busiest mo- 
ments by questions such as, " Mother, this button has come 
off," and " Mother, my pencil's broken," or " Where is a 
pencil?" My decision to remedy the need of wasting time 
on such little things resulted in the following : First, I took 
an attractive Indian basket, called the children around me, 
dedicated it as my " Handy Basket," and made a game of it 
to see who could add most to it. The ordinary threads, 
needles, small scissors, and thimble were placed in it, and each 
child was to add every button she came across loose. Now, 
when an accident happens, here comes the needy one bringing 
the remedies along, and only a second of my time is required. 
Next, I screwed a patent pencil-sharpener in the playroom 
within easy reach, and above I nailed a neat wooden box, then 
instigated a contest to see who could find the most pencils for 
the box. No longer does ' ' Let 's play school " or ' ' Let 's draw ' ' 
have any terrors for me, for they can all wait on themselves. 

Mrs. L. D. W., W. Va. 

THE GAME SYSTEM 

My two small children had lost, damaged, or destroyed many 
of their pretty small toys by reason of their being put away 



248 GOOD HOUSEKEEPING'S BOOK OF MENUS 

indiscriminately with the heavier toys. Not liking the men- 
tal effect of so much casual destruction, I worked out a plan 
for grouping their toys into so-called ' * games. ' ' For example, 
several celluloid ducks, a little pail of sea shells, a box of 
Japanese shells containing tiny toys, two miniature boats, a 
little mirror, a wee celluloid parasol, and several very small 
dolls were all fitted into a berry basket painted (when in- 
verted) to represent a house or shack, and became known as 
the Beach Game. A fleet of battleships, several three-inch 
trains, and numerous tiny lead automobiles and horse- 
drawn vehicles are the Street Game and are usually asked 
for in combination with a box of dominoes. The Street Game 
in its present proportions fits into a pound candy box. But 
one beauty of the scheme is its capacity for growth. Each 
new toy must be allotted to a ' l game ' suitable to its uses, and 
this affords constructive thought. The various " games" are 
kept on the shelf with the regulation games and sets of blocks. 
The children are given a choice of one or two "games" at a 
time, each, with the understanding that each game is to be 
replaced in the box which fits it. My children are very careless 
and most "rampageous," as one only expects wide-awake and 
healthy youngsters to be, but not once in more than six 
months have they failed to replace properly one of the games. 
I think they really enjoy fitting back the toys. And best of 
all, each toy is safe, with a place of its own, where it can not 
be crushed by larger toys, and has slight chance of being 
lost. Breakages are prone to occur even with the game sys- 
tem, but the casualties are reduced 90 percent. 

M . J. E. R., Wash., D. C. 



TEACHING SYSTEM 

I know all mothers find teaching system to their children a 
problem. I have solved mine by taking a large sheet of paper 
and on it a series of pictures cut from magazines. For in- 
stance, the rules for going to bed had pictures of children 
taking shoes and stocEings off, hanging up clothes, washing 
face, etc. This makes rules interesting, especially for the 
young members of the nursery who can not read. They love 
to see the pictures of other children cleaning their teeth and 
putting away their t*ys. Mrs. A. J. C. f Ala.

A DRINKING GLASS FOB EVERY CHILD 

The children would come in at odd times to get a glass of 
water until at dinner time there would not be enough glasses 
to set the table. So I screwed wire glass-holders into the 
window casement side by side, labeling one for each member 
of the family. Now each child can keep his own glass separate 
from the others, and all are handy to gather up for washing.

A NEW FUNNEL 

I have seen many " wrinkles " for getting liquid into small- 
necked bottles, but I think I have found a better way than 
any of them. I take the little metal top of an umbrella cover, 
and it makes the finest sort of small funnel, which will fit into 
almost any bottle made. If one is in great haste, one can put 
a larger funnel into this, as the upper part is nearly an inch 
in diameter, and then one may pour as fast as one wishes.

A PLACE FOR THE DISHPAN 

To save reaching under the drainboard to get my dishpari

drainer where they may be reached without any effort.

A USE FOE PARAFFIN WRAPPERS 

A household help that I have found invaluable is the paraffin 
paper wrappers that come around loaves of bread. These 
lend themselves to many kitchen services, but the best use I 
make of them is for the cleaning and polishing of my coal 
range. When the steel is moderately -warm, the paraffin melts 
just enough to polish it. Mrs. W. D. F., Kans. 

ORDERING ICE BY POUNDS 

It is often a great annoyance to the busy housewife to accom- 
plish the necessary household tasks and still keep a watchful 
eye for the ice man's arrival in order to tell him the amount 
of ice desired. I have eliminated this inconvenience in the 
following manner: I cut out the figures, ten, fifteen, twenty, 
thirty, etc., from a large-typed calender, and when I need ice, 
I attach the necessary figure to the ice card with a clip.

To CARE FOR TABLE OILCLOTH 

To make table oilcloth more satisfactory and durable, clean 
it well and rub it occasionally with liquid wax, always polish- 
ing well afterward. It will be easy to keep clean, and its life-

soft cloth or piece of flannel around an iron, using this for a 
polisher. Mrs. M. W., III. 

To KEEP THE SINK SHINING 

Soap jelly, which is made by dissolving a large bar of soap in 
two quarts of boiling water and two tablespoonfuls of kero- 
sene, is a great aid in keeping a white, shining sink. I keep 
a glass of soap jelly on the sink shelf, and when I have finished 
my dishes, I put a little on a cloth which I keep especially 
for that purpose, and clean the sink. Then I wash the sink 
out with clean, hot, sudsy water, and the result is well worth 
the effort. Mrs. J. A., OJcla.

A ROMPER SUGGESTION 

The question of how to make rompers for my year-old son and 
do away with those wet buttons and buttonholes between the 
legs, which are always so difficult to manage, was solved in 
this way. I made kimono-sleeved waists of white or light 
material opening in the front. To these I buttoned dark- 
colored gingham bloomers of the popular Dutch style, so that 
they dropped across the front instead of the back. When it 
becomes necessary to change his diapers, I just unbutton the 
bloomers across the front at the waist and pull his legs out of 
the elastic knee bands. I find this much quicker and easier 
than the usual method. Mrs. J. A. P., Conn. 



BUTTONHOLES ON SHEER MATERIAL 

Have you ever been discouraged when making buttonholes in 
material which frays out easily? Try the following: Mark 
with chalk the place where you wish to put the buttonholes, 
also the size. Take the garment to a place where machine 
hemstitching is done and have them run the machine over 
each chalk line. The hemstitching can then be cut as for 
picoting and the buttonholes worked over the picot. In this 
way, you will have a neat, satisfactory buttonhole.

EVENING STOCKING DARNING 

Darning dark stockings at night was quite an ordeal for me

the light enabling me to darn faster and more neatly, I found 
the glass surface an excellent darner. Mrs. W. G. H., Pa.

RENOVATING CRETONNE DRAPERIES 

When I took down my cretonne draperies this year, the cloth 
was still perfectly good, but the sun had faded the colors. I 
laundered the draperies, then while they were still hot from 
the ironing, I took regular school coloring crayons and went 
over the designs. I used the color sparingly where little color 
was needed, and pressed harder where the color was deepest 
in the original design. Then I put plain paper over the work 
and pressed it with a hot iron. The curtains looked like new.

SETTING IN INSERTION 

When making my baby clothes, I discovered a method of 
setting in insertion which I have used since on all sheer ma- 
terial. Hems on either side are avoided by having a line of 
hemstitching made where you intend the insertion to go. 
Cut through the hemstitching and sew the insertion to either 
side with fine stitches. This saves much time in rolling hems 
and produces a neat finish. Mrs. E. T. N., 0. 

SLEEPING-PORCH NIGHT CLOTHES 

For sleeping-porch night clothes, I find that a pair of full- 
sized white cotton blankets without a border will make two 
night suits of the style which have long sleeves, long legs, and 
feet, and button from the neck down to the waistline in front. 
I can get a hood also, to go with each suit. These blanket 
night suits cut to advantage, and are very warm and quite 
inexpensive. Mrs. 8. E. C., Wash. 

SLIP PETTICOATS 

In making slip petticoats for my growing girls, I do not sew 
tip the shoulder seams, but face them back for about two 
inches and sew on the under side of the fronts, and the upper 
side of the backs, three snap fasteners about an inch apart. 
The skirt may then be adjusted at the shoulder seams to suit 
the length of the dress with which it is worn, for although 
theoretically all the dresses are the same length, some shrink 
more than others in laundering, and it is hard to have the 
petticoats and dresses of identical length. 

Mrs. S. W. F., N. J. 



RECIPES AND HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 253 

To REPLACE WORN-OUT TAPE 

When running a new elastic or tape through underwear, pin 
one end of the new tape to one end of the old. Then, as the 
old tape is pulled out, the new tape will be pulled in. 

Mrs. H. A. 8., Pa. 

WHEN DARNING STOCKINGS 

Do not use darning stitches when the heels of your stockings 
become thin at the line of the top of your low shoes. Use a 
spool of silk and make parallel lines of fine chain stitches. 
This matches the stocking mesh so well that it can scarcely be 
detected. F. P., N. T. 

WHEN LENGTHENING DRESSES 

When it is necessary to lengthen my little girl's dresses, I find 
the regular gauze bandage which comes in rolls of different 
widths just the thing to use in facing them. The gauze shrinks 
so little that if it is placed on the under side when stitching, 
the hem will be perfectly smooth and not wrinkled when 
ironed. Mrs. M. K. y la. 

WHEN MAKING SILK CORDING 

It is often impossible to buy suitable cord for silk, satin, and 
other thin materials, as the regulation cord sold in the shops 
is rather heavy, not always graded sufficiently as to size, and 
has a twist which the silk covering does not always disguise. 
I have found an excellent substitute in the use of wool of any 
size, color, or condition. You can regulate the size of the 
cording by the number of strands of wool selected. Further- 
more, the wool is light, and cording made from it can be 
sewn on very easily. In this way, old, faded, and otherwise 
useless wool becomes highly useful. Mrs. W. T., N. J. 



What is 
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE? 

GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE, which is just one of 
the many departments touching every phase of women's 
interests from fashions to foods which are maintained 
by Good Housekeeping, is a highly organized laboratory 
where, for more than thirteen years, all kinds of house- 
hold appliances, recipes, and home managing methods 
have been tested under conditions which closely ap- 
proximate those found in the average home. 

GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE is operated by a staff 
of eight experts, together with eleven assistants. 

Two departments 

It is made up of two departments. One is the Depart- 
ment of Household Engineering, which tests new ap- 
pliances and labor saving devices. The other is the 
Department of Cookery, which tests recipes and evolves 
new methods of cookery in well equipped kitchen labo- 
ratories. The recipes set forth in this book represent the 
favorites submitted by Good Housekeeping readers all 
over the country. These recipes, as well as every recipe 
in GOOD HOUSEKEEPING MAGAZINE, have been thoroughly 
standardized, tested and tasted by the corps of trained 
workers in the Department of Cookery. 

At your service 

The entire staff of both departments of GOOD HOUSE- 
KEEPING INSTITUTE is entirely at your service at all 
times to assist you in your home-managing problems. 
The service is free to Good Housekeeping readers; there 
is no obligation of any nature whatsoever. Do not 
hesitate to call upon them.
