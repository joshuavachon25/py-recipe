PREFACE 



THERE have been many cook books published in America, 
but fully aware of this fact and of their excellence, the 
author of this volume yet claims for her work an entirely 
unique value. Receipts are found herein which have been 
collected for generations, including Creole and French 
receipts known only to the wealthy planter families of 
the far South, whose trained chefs seldom liked to reveal 
the secret of their delicious creations. Having spent her 
girlhood as a resident of Louisiana, the author early conceived the idea 
of collecting formulas for all the delicacies of the table served in the 
homes of her relatives and friends. In later years, coming further 
North, all that was best in Virginia and Kentucky cookery she also 
obtained, and it is not claiming more than truth to state that a more 
comprehensive cook book has never been issued in the South.

Kentucky Burgoo. 

Twenty-five gallons of water, 5 shin bones of beef, 1 blade of 
beef, 12 chickens, 1 bushel Irish potatoes, 12 cans tomatoes, 12 cans 
corn, 1 peck onions. Wash the meat carefully, put on with water 
to boil 3 hours, then add prepared vegetables with pepper and salt, 
When done, chop meat and return to kettle. Cook burgoo 12 hours. 

This quantity makes 60 gallons of burgoo. 

Tomato Soup, With Stock. 

Take the bones and trimmings from a roast, with any scraps 
of meat. Put in a kettle and cover with cold water; have twice as 
much water as meat. Add 1 onion, 2 whole cloves, 6 pepper corns, 
a piece of celery root, and 1 tablespoonful of salt. Let it cook 4 
hours, skimming often; then add 6 sliced tomatoes, or a one-quart 
can of tomatoes. Cook 1 hour longer, then skim out the bones and 
meat and strain the liquor through a puree strainer, rubbing all the 
tomato pulp through. Heat again and thicken with 1 tablespoon 
butter and 1 of flour well blended. Boil a minute and serve. 

Cream of Cauliflower Soup. 

Heat 1 pint of chicken or veal stock, 1 pint of milk, y 2 coffee 
cup of sweet cream. When boiling thicken with 1 tablespoon of 
fine whole wheat flour; add salt and white pepper. Cook half a 
cauliflower in boiling salted water 20 minutes. Cut off the little 
flowerets, using none of the stalk; put in enough to thicken the 
broth. 

To Prepare Stock for Use. 

The stock may be seasoned only with pepper and salt. Remove 
fat from stock, and put one quart of this liquid into kettle over a 
quick fire. Simmer carefully, and more stock may be added : also 
one bay leaf, three sprigs of parsley, % blade of mace, a little 
thyme, or summer savory. Vegetables may be added in proportion 
of % tablespoon each, of onion, carrot and turnips to each quart 
of soup — these should be cut fine, and scalded before adding to 
soup. Simmer 1 hour; it can be then strained and set away or al- 
lowed to settle. It may be used for clear soup or served as a 
vegetable soup.

Thickening for Soup. 

Soup may be thickened with bread, instead of flour, corn starch 
or arrowroot. When this is used, force meat balls, e<^ or spinach 
balls may be served in it, instead of vegetables. The French and 
German niles say bread must be saturated with broth and fat from 
top of kettle, and baked until broth has evaporated and crusts are 
brown. Otherwise the bread should be dried, and browned lightly. 
Add a small amount of stock, and simmer until soft. Stir until re- 
duced to a panada. Two tablespoons of dried bread crumbs to 1 
quart of soup. Strain again. The German rye bread is excellent for 
this thickening. It may be used with stock, or simply boiled in 
water, and enriched with eggs. Or use Caraway sauce and toasted 
brown sugar. 

Soup Stock. 

Meat bones for stock must be absolutely fresh, and about equal 
in proportion. Hock or shins of beef, ends of rib roast, and portions 
of the neck or shoulder are suitable. The first mentioned furnish 
chiefly gelatine, the latter yield flavor. Sponge outside of bone 
with a cloth wrung out of warm water, but do not wet the freshly- 
cut surface of meat, Cut meat from the bones and put in soup 
kettle, having first inserted in it a perforated plate to prevent bones 
from touching bottom of kettle. It should have a close-fitting top. 
Place the meat upon the bones and cover with cold water. It should 
be at least an hour in coming to a boil. Let it boil gently 5 minutes. 
then put on back of range to simmer 8 hours. After cooking 2 hours, 
seasoning is added ; 1 level teaspoon of salt and 4 pepper corns to 
each quart of liquid. After it has been strained the meat and bones 
with 2 quarts of water simmered 2 hours will yield a stock of lighter 
quality, but of much value, which may be used for tomato, bean or 
clear soup. Cool stock quickly and put in ice box until needed for 
use. Skim off all grease and strain again. 

Tomato Puree. 

Take 1 quart of tomatoes and put them on to cook ; when hot 
add a pinch of soda, let it foam, skim well and press through a 
sieve; set on back of range to keep hot. Have 1 quart of milk in 
double boiler, after it boils add 7 butter crackers that have been 
pulverized, a large lump of butter, pepper and salt. When ready 
to -serve, add tomatoes to the milk. 

Soup Stock. 

Meat and bones for soup must be absolutely fresh. Hock or shin 
of beef or end of rib roast and portions of neck and shoulder. The 
first mentioned furnish chiefly gelatine, the latter give flavor. A 
knuckle of veal, or the hone trimmed from a leg of mutton, and 
a few ounces of sliced ham may be used in making stock or soup. 
Sponge outside of meat with a cloth wrung out of warm water, but 



KENTUCKY RECEIPT BOOK. 



do not wet the freshly-cut surface of meai. Cut meat from hones 
and put in a soup kettle. Put a perforated pie pan in hottom to 
prevent meat touching the hottom. Cover with cold water and sim- 
mer one hour. There should be a close-fitting top. on kettle. Then 
boil 5 minutes and put on back of range to simmer 8 hours. 

Consomme. 

Cut 3 pounds of lean beef in small pieces, with 1 large carrot 
and 1 large onion. Have the vegetables washed and peeled, then 
put with the beef 4 cloves, salt and pepper to taste, a very small 
piece of red pepper pod. Put this in a soup pot with 1 tablespoon 
of butter, then fill up the pot with stock from a boiled chicken. 
You can boil the carcass of a roasted turkey, and put this stock in 
instead of the chicken. Let it come to a good boil, skim thoroughly, 
and set pot on back of range to simmer slowly 1 hours. Strain 
this and keep in cool place until the next day. Skim off all grease, 
put in porcelain kettle with the well-beaten white of 1 egg, let it 
come to a good boil and serve very hot. One teacup of sherry wine 
may be added if desired. 

Thickening for Soups. 

Soups are thickened with flour, corn starch or rice flour, 1 
tablespoon for each quart of soup, heaping if flour is used; scant if 
rice flour or corn starch. Mix flour with cold water to a smooth 
paste, then add liquid until it is easily poured into soup. Let it boil 
20 minutes. If butter is used, put in a saucepan, and when bubbling 
stir in flour quickly until smooth ; then add gradually 1 cup of hot 
soup : it should be thin enough to pour. In vegetable soups or purees 
as soon as butter and flour are blended it can be added to the soup. 
If a brown thickening is desired, melt the butter and let it become 
brown, then add the flour at once and stir quickly. Add water or 
soup gradually. Flour that is browned while dry colors, but does 
not thicken. Thickened soups should be of the consistency of good 
cream. Purees are thicker. 

To Clear Soup Stock. 

Remove fat and allow the white and shell of 1 egg for every 
quart of stock. If you wish to flavor the stock more highly, add 
a /2 a saltspoon of celery seed, and the thinnest possible shavings from 
the rinds of half a lemon. Add also the lemon juice, and more salt 
and pepper if needed .Mix celery seed, lemon and egg with the 
cold stock and beat well. Stir constantly until liquid is hot, then 
allow it to boil 10 minutes. Put on back of range, and add i/. cup 
of cold water. Let it remain 10 minutes, then strain through cloth 
wrung out of hot water, which must be placed in a colander. Allow 
it to drain slowly. Serve as a clear soup. Heat to boiling point and 
have in tureen thin slices of lemon, 1 wine glass of sherry wine, 
yolks of hard boiled eggs, or delicately flavored force meat balls.

FOWL 



The Selection of Fowls. 

In choosing fowls select those that are heavy in proportion to 
their size. For fricassee, roast or boiled chicken a hen is best. For 
croquettes, highly seasoned entrees or soups a cock may be used. 
White flesh poultry, such as turkeys and chickens, require to be well 
done. Game with dark meat, such as canvas-back ducks, venison and 
almost all birds, should be cooked rare. 

To Dress Poultry. 

Poultry should be dressed as soon as killed, as the feathers 
come out more easily. To pluck poultry pull out 2 feathers at a 
time, with a quick motion toward the head. Remove pin feathers 
with the aid of sharp knife. To singe the fowls put in a pan, roll of 
lighted paper and singe the bird thoroughly, but use care not to 
scorch the skin. Take off the head and legs, cut open the skin on 
the back of the neck, disjoint the latter and cut off close to the body. 
Separate the crop carefully from the skin of the neck, remove that 
and the windpipe, insert one finger into the opening and loosen 
the organs from the breast bone. Be sure not to break the entrails or 
the gall bladder, but pull out all together,, for should it happen 
the chicken or fowl is almost ruined, as it imparts a bitter tasttr 
which spoils the delicate flavor. 

To Truss a Fowl. 

Push the legs up until the knees are above point of the breast 
bone, cross them at the tail and tie firmly. Put a skewer through 
body at the wings and thighs, press close to the body and tie across 
the back. 

To Prepare Giblets. 

Be careful not to use giblets unless sound. They should be a 
light color. Cut away any portion that has been discolored by the 
gall bladder and be careful it does not touch the meat. Cut through 
the thick muscle of the gizzard and peel it off, without breaking into 
the little gristmill inside. Put them in salted water 1 hour. Cook 
neck of fowl with the giblets. The legs and wing tips may be added 
to the stock pot after scalding and peeling. 

To Stuff a Fowl. 

Put fowl in a deep bowl, fill the breast with dressing until 
plump, but allow for expanding while cooking. Fold skin of the 
neck loosely back and fasten with a bird skewer. Have opening not 
more than 3 inches, can close by sewing with large darning needle 
and soft cotton. Leave long ends on thread.

One of the requisites for success in the making of perfect 
salads is that all vegetables and herbs must be perfectly fresh, for 
without that the salad is insipid, as the best of mayonnaise dressing 
fails to give it the piquant flavor, which is so highly appreciated by 
the epicure. Also a salient point to be remembered is that oil, 
vinegar and eggs must be perfectly cold. Otherwise a perfect salad 
is not obtainable.

shire sauce, juice of % lemon, % box of gelatine, a dash of cayenne

ing for 15 minutes, then rub through a sieve. Dissolve the gelatine

stantly; when well mixed add the vinegar and lemon juice. Cook

The best blend of coffee is % of a pound of Java and ^4 of a 
pound of Mocha. Properly prepared this makes the most delicious 
coffee obtainable. A most important fact to be remembered is al- 
ways to have freshly-boiled water, but it must boil hard only for 
about 3 minutes, as much of its natural properties escape by evap- 
oration. Clear coffee is obtained by using the white and shell of 1 
egg for 1 heaping cup of ground coffee. Another most important 
point for making good coffee is in the roasting. For a few overdone 
or scorched berries will ruin the whole amount, and consequently a 
uniformly roasted berry, each grain coated with white of egg, will 
insure perfection in the art of making coffee. And always use the 
best coffee, as it is cheaper in the end, as a less quantity is required 
and the best results obtained. A poor cup of coffee is not only ob- 
jectionable, but a menace to good health. 

Roasting Coffee. 

Put 1 pound of raw coffee in pan, place on range, stir con- 
stantly for 15 minutes, until coffee begins' to color, then cover pan 
and shake until a chestnut color. When it cools a little add 1 beaten 
egg with the shell; beat until each grain of coffee is coated. Re- 
move and put in airtight cans ; grind coffee as needed. 

Mock Cream. 

Froth the white of 1 egg and add to it a small lump of butter. 
When ready to serve coffee pour it very gradually upon this mock 
cream and stir well to prevent curdling. It proves an excellent sub- 
stitute for cream. 

French Drip Coffee. 

Allow 1 heaping tablespoon of ground coffee for each person

drip several times, keep coffee hot, but do not allow it to boil. It 
is excellent served with hot cream or scalded new milk. 

Drip Coffee. 

Put 1 coffee cup of ground coffee into the upper division of the 
coffee pot and pour over it 1 quart of boiling water. Place where it 
will be kept hot without boiling. If it drips through rapidly pour

t© can fruit* 



When canning ripe or mellow fruit, it requires but a small 
amount of cooking. Only long enough for sugar to penetrate the 
fruits, otherwise it would become mushy, and soon spoil. Harder 
fruits, such as quinces or pears, require longer boiling. One-half 
a pound of sugar or a less amount is sufficient for 1 pound of fruit 
in canning. One of the most important points to be observed is That 
all fruit jars be absolutely air tight. And another important fea- 
ture to be remembered is, have fruit boiling hot, and fill jars to the 
brim. Keep all canned fruits or vegetables in a dark, dry place. 
Otherwise they have a mouldy taste, which renders them unfit for 
use. It is important that all vegetables and fruits to be canned 
must be prepared in a porcelain kettle, for a copper kettle is dan- 
gerous, as the verdigris that forms is a deadly poisen. It is well to 
examine preserves and fruits, for the first few weeks, as fermenta- 
tion often ensues at that time. 

Bartlett Pears. 

The Bartlett pear is the best for canning. Pare neatly and halve, 
but do not core them. Put into cold water at once to prevent dis- 
coloraion. Pears and quinces should be simmered, closely covered, 
until tender, then add sugar. Strain boiling water for the syrup, and 
add sugar. Put in hot jars and seal at once. The fruit selected for 
canning must be large and perfect. Strawberries are the exception 
to this rule. For the medium size berry that ripens toward the last 
of the season is preferable, having a fine flavor. 

To Can Red Raspberries. 

When canning red raspberries, make the syrup of equal parts of 
red currant juice and water. Add granulated sugar and boil until 
almost done. Put in hot jars and seal. 

To Can Peaches. 

Take freestone peaches, peel and remove pit. Put in preserving 
kettle with enough cold water to cover them; when half done add 
granulated sugar and cook a few minutes longer. Have jars hot, put 
in peaches and seal at once. 

To Can Butterbeans. 

Put beans in kettle with enough water to cover them. Add salt 
and cook until almost done. Have cans heated, and put in beans, 
seal at once.

from the eob and put both in preserving kettle. Cook until almost 
done. Add salt and pepper, seal while hot. 

Canned Quinces. 

Peel and core quinces, quartering them. Allow y% pound sugar 
to each pound of fruit ; cover with water. Let water and sugar cook 
until almost a syrup, then drop in the fruit and cook till easily 
pierced by a straw. Put in cans and seal. To serve as a vegetable, 
put quinces in baking dish with a little water added, and set in oven 
to brown. 

Canned Blackberries. 

Boil the berries in water until tender, then add y 2 pound susrar 
to 1 pound of fruit. Boil 15 minutes. Prepare huckleberries in the 
same way. 

To Can Peaches. 

Peaches may be canned whole, or cut in half. Remove a few 
of the pits, and cook in the syrup, as it greatly improves the flavor. 

To Can Cherries. 

To can cherries, they may be seeded or left whole. Allow a /4 
pound sugar to 1 pound of fruit. Acid fruits require more sugar. 
Add a little water if not sufficiently juicy. Cook fruit until tender, 
and seal at once. If fruit is in tin cans, remove as soon as opened, 
and leave in china dish for 30 minutes, before using, as it greatly im- 
proves the flavor. 

To Can Fruit. 

To can fruit, peaches, cherries, or quinces, % pound of sugar 
may be added to fruit, or a less quantity, if fruit is sweet. Use as 
little water as possible to cover fruit, as it lessens the fruit flavor. 

To Can Apples. • 

For table, use the Rambeau apples ; for pies, the Northern Spies. 
Peel and core them. Put in preserving kettle with a little water. 
After cooking some time, add sufficient granulated sugar to sweeten 
them. Put in hot jars and seal at once. 

To Can Blackberries. 

Wash and cover with water, when scalding hot add granulate 1 
sugar. Put in hot jars and seal at once. 

To Can Pears.
