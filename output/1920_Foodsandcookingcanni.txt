WHAT PUBLIC DOCUMENTS ARE 
AND HOW TO GET THEM 

THE Government of the United States is the greatest of all modern publishers. 
It employs thousands of scientists, who are engaged the year round in mak- 
ing researches and investigations in all branches of agriculture and house- 
hold economy, in geology, in mining, in electricity, in chemistry, in astronomy, in 
engineering, in aviation, in preventive medicine, in forestry, in irrigation, in shipping 
and railroad problems, in trade and manufactures. The arts of war as well as those 
of peace are also actively cultivated. The greatest art of all, that of maintaining and 
spreading free government, is strenuously carried on by President, Cabinet, Senators, 
Representatives, Army, and Navy. 

The results of all these activities of the most comprehensive and effective organi- 
zation ever known, are constantly reduced to print and poured out in an incessant 
flood from the Government Printing Office at Washington, the largest printing 
plant in the world. 

The greater number of these public documents are sold by the Superintendent 
of Documents, located in the Government Printing Office. The Government did 
not establish this sales office for purposes of profit, but as a public convenience. 
The prices charged cover only paper and printing, no charge being made for the 
services of the statesmen and scientists who are the authors of the various books, 
pamphlets, periodicals, and maps, nor are commissions allowed for their sale. 
The documents have the freedom of the mails and are sent without postage. 

The main condition of purchase is that payment be made in advance of shipment. 
The Superintendent of Documents is not authorized to supply free copies of any- 
thing except Price Lists, which are described in detail on another page. 



HOW TO REMIT 

Remittances should be made to the Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D. C, by coupons, postal money order, express order, 
or New York draft. If currency is sent, it will be at sender's risk. Foreign orders 
should be accompanied by international money order or New York draft. 

Postage stamps, coins defaced or worn smooth, foreign money, and uncertified 
checks will not be accepted. 

Coupons that are good until used in exchange for Government publications sold 
by the Superintendent of Documents, may be purchased from this office in sets of 
twenty for $1.00. 

No charge is made for postage on documents forwarded to points in the United 
States, Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Samoa, or to Canada, 
Cuba, Mexico, or Shanghai. To other countries the regular rate of postage is 
charged.
