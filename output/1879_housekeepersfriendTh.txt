WATCHES, AMERICAN. 

The first American Watch was made in 1857, and is still in perfect 
running order. Its makers were Messrs. Howard & Dennison, in 
Boston. It has two main springs, and two complete sets of winding 
apparatus, in consequence of which it is larger and heavier than most 
watches of to-day. The Howard Watch Company, which was the 
first organized, has made over a quarter of a million watches. The 
Waltham Watch has been made on a more extensive scale, and its 
manufacture now reaches over two millions. The Waterbury Watch 
is a low-priced wonder of mechanism, selling for about three dollars, 
and actually keeping time, though not with the precision attained by 
the more costly watches.

The First Use of ax Umbrella. — For many centuries the 
umbrella had been in common use in China and Japan before it 
was introduced into European countries. About two hundred years 
ago, it was introduced into London by Jonas Hanway, a benevolent 
and eccentric old gentleman. When he first raised his umbrella, on 
a rainy day, he found it of unexpected use in keeping off a shower 
of sticks and stones with which the street boys pelted him. For 
a long while it was considered effeminate and ridiculous to use an 
umbrella.

Never Too Late to Learn, etc. — Cato, at eighty years of 
age, began to study the Greek language. Socrates, at an extreme old 
age, learned to play on musical instruments. Plutarch, when between 
seventy and eighty, began to learn Latin. Doctor Johnson applied 
himself to the Dutch language but a few years before his death. 
Ludovico Monaldesco, at the great age of one hundred and fifteen 
years, wrote the memoirs of his own times. Ogilby, the translator 
of Homer and Virgil, was unacquainted with Latin or Greek till he 
was past fifty. Franklin did not begin his philosophical studies till 
he had reached his fiftieth year. Dryden, in his sixty-eighth year, 
commenced the translation of the iEneid, his most pleasing produc- 
tion. Boccaccio was thirty years when he commenced his studies in 
light literature ; yet he became one of the greatest masters of the 
Tuscan dialect, Dante and Petrarch being the other two. Many 
similar cases might be cited.

GLENNY'S SNOW BALM 

(TRADE MARK.) 
SO CJE1VXS PER BOX. 

This elegant preparation is the result of many years' experience and 
personal study. It is prepared with the greatest care from materials 
which cannot possibly injure, and are sure to benefit the skin, and its 
merits need but a trial to supplant the numerous deleterious mineral 
compounds now in use. Unlike the various tablets, powders, etc., which 
merely cover and eventually roughen and destroy the skin, GLENNY'S 
SNOW BALM thoroughly removes and eradicates all 

SUNBURN, TAN BLOTCHES, PIMPLES, 

and all impurities arising from a diseased state of the cuticle, thereby 
imparting the beautiful transparent glow of blooming youth. 
Glenny's Snow Balm is a 

Positive Cure for Chafing, Itching Piles, and all Local 

Irritations. Instant relief procured by 

a single application. 

A lady writes: "Its effect is magical." A trial we solicit. A cure we 
guarantee. Cooling, Soothing and Healing in its action. 

Glenny's Snow Balm, 50 Cents per Box. Sent free to any address 
upon receipt of the price.

FABLES OF .ESOP. 

BY CARL VAN SICHEM. 
Reprodu$ed from, the Holland Edition of 16»9. 



THE FISHERMAN. 



A FISHERMAN was fishing in a certain river, and having thrown 
out his nets so as to impede the flowing of the water, began to 
beat it so that the fishes might fall into the nets. A neighbor ob- 
serving this, expostulated with him for disturbing the water and 
rendering it unfit to drink. " Very well," he replied; " if I do not 
beat the water I shall catch no fish." 

Moral. — Public men generally agitate their country for their 
own political ends. 



THE FOX AXD THE BRAMBLE. 

A rox creeping along a hedge, and being about to fall, caught 
hold of a bramble, and previously tore the soles of his feet. On 
this account he abused the bramble, declaring that she had used 
him worse than the hedge. " Heigho !" said the bramble, "you 
really must have been out of your senses to fasten yourself on 
me, who am myself accustomed to fasten upon others." 

Moral,.— Men -e mad who expect assistance from a natural 
enemy. 



THE FOX AXD THE MASK. 

A fox entering the apartments of a costumer, found upon the 
floor a mask, which was admirable in its imitation of a human 
head. Taking it up in his paws and observing it carefully, he 
said, " Oh ! what a beautiful head ! but it has no brains." 

Moral. — So among men, however handsome the person, it is 
worthless without mind. 



THE SOW AXD THE DOG. 

A sow and dog one day disputed about their productiveness, 
the dog declared that he was the most prolific of all footed ani- 
mals. To this the sow replied. "Yes, but when you say this, you 
must remember that your whelps are born blind." 

Moral. — Things must be judged not by the rapidity but by the 
perfection of their production.

THE OLD MAN AND DEATH. 

An old man, employed in carrying faggots to a city for sale, be- 
ing wearied with his long journey, s;it down by the wayside and 
besought "Death'' to come. " Death " at once answered the old 
man's summons, and asked him why he had thus called him. 
" That, lifting up the load, you may help place it on my shoulders 
again," was the old man's reply. 

Mokal. — Every man clings to life, however poor or unhappy he 
may be. 

THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN. 

An ass dressed in a lion's skin was amusing himself ranging 
about and terrifying other animals, when he happened upon a fox 
and endeavored to frighten her, but she by chance having heard 
his voice before, said, " 1 too should have feared you had I iiot 
been acquainted with your bray." 

Moral. — Pretentious persons who, to those who do not know 
them, appear to be something, seldom fail to betray themselves by 
their own words. 



THE BIRD-CATCHER AND THE VIPER. 

A bird-catcher seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, and wish- 
ing to capture it, prepared his net and watched his opportunity, 
having his thoughts directed intently upon his object. Unawares, 
he trod upon a viper that lay asleep in the grass. The viper stung 
him when he falling into a swoon, said to himself, " Wo is me ! 
while I purposed to kill another, I myself have IV en into the snare 
of death." 

Moral. — Men often, unawares, fall int' ue snare they lay for 
others. 



THE DOG AND THE MEAT-COOK. 

A dog rushing into a kitchen where a cook was engaged in his 
work, seized a heart and ran away with it. The cook turning 
round and seeing the dog in flight, cried out, " Hello, there ! re- 
member I shall watch you hereafter, wherever you are, for you 
have not only stolen from me but taught me a good lesson." 

Moral. — Evils are many times the most effective warnings. 



THE WOMAN AND HER HEN. 

A country woman had a hen that laid an egg every day. 
Thinking that she might be made to produce two instead of one, 
she determined to give the hen a double allowance of food. From 
that cause the hen became fat and never again laid another egg. 

Moral. — Those who, from avarice, wish for more than they 
possess ; often lose what they already have. 



TULIP SOAP is the best in use. 



Burnett's Flavoring Extracts 



are invanaDiy acknowledged the purest 
and best. 



THE JETHIOP. 

The owner of a black slave, believing that his color arose from 
the misuse and ill care of bis former master, resorted to every 
plan to make him white. Subjecting him to all methods of clean- 
ing and scrubbing, be threw him into a severe cold, but did not 
change his complexion in the least. 

Moral.— It is useless to fight against nature 



THE HEN AND THE SWALLOW. 

A motherly old hen brooded the eggs of a viper and nourished 
them into life. A swallow, seeing what she had done, said, " You 
ailly old granny; don't you know that these vipers you have 
hatched will, when grown, inliict injury not only on you but on 
every one ? 

Moral.— Wrong is not to be countenanced, though it may be 
dictated by good intentions. 

THE LION, THE ASS, AND THE FOX. 

A lion, an ass, and a fox agreed to assist one another in hunt- 
inc. On returning from the chase the lion requested the ass to 
give to each that portion which was his due, and the ass divided 
the spoils into three equal parts. Bursting into a rage the lion 
devoured the ass and then asked the fox to make a division. This 
the fox did, placing all the three had killed in a large heap, reserv- 
ing to himself the smallest morsel. '" Who taught you this excel- 
lent art of division ? " said the lion. " I learned it from the ass," 
replied the fox. . 

Moral. — Happy are those who learn from the misfortunes of 
others. 

THE LION AND THE BEAR. 

A lion and a bear for a long time fought for the possession of a 
kid that had fallen between them, and faint from the combat lay 
down exhausted. A fox who had from a distance witnessed the 
fight, seeing them thus situated, seized the kid and scampered off 
with it. The lion and V>ear saw him, but being unable to rise, 
on account of the wounds they had given each other, cried out. 
" How miserable we are, that we should thus fight for a fox." 

MORAL.— Often one man has all the toil and another all the 
profit. 

THE SICK RAVEN. 

A crow being sick unto death, said to its mother, " Pray to God 
for my safety and do not mourn." The mother crow answering 
said, "Who of the Gods, O son ! will pity you, for what tiesh you 
have not devoured ! " ,.,»■, * ■ i • 

MORAL.— Those who are enemies to mankind find no friends in 
time of distress.

THE FOX AND THE LIOX. 

A. fox who had never seen a lion, by chance fell in with one 
and was nearly frightened out of his life. On meeting him a sec- 
ond time ho felt some fear, but on seeing him a third time he ap- 
proached him and commenced a conversation. 

Moral. — Familiarity generally softens prejudices. 



THE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR. 

Ax old woman having lost the use of her eyes, bargained with a 
doctor that if he should cure her she would pay him a handsome 
reward; if not she would give him nothing. From time to time 
the doctor visited his patient and applied his salve to her eyes, and 
each time on leaving her house he took away, or rather stole, some 
article of her property. When he had cured her he had stolen all 
her effects, and the old woman being unable to see any of her goods, 
refused to pay him. Summoned before the court the old woman 
stood up and said, "He declares that I am healed ; on the contra- 
ry, I say that I am still blind, for at the time I became blind, my 
house was well filled with chattels and goods. Yet now I am un- 
able to see a single article in it. 

Moral. — Depraved men do not see that by their actions they 
bring an argument against themselves. 



THE THIEVES AND THE COCK. 

Two thieves broke into a house, but found therein nothing else 
than a cock, whom they carried off. Reaching their home they 
killed the cock, he crying out before his death, "Spare me ! fori 
am of use to men. I wake them in the night to their work. 
'' That is the real reason why we destroy you," they replied ; " for 
when you arouse your neighbors, you put an end to our business." 

Moral. — The protectors of virtue are obnoxious to evil-doers. 



A FARMER AND HIS SONS. 

A farmer at the point of death called to his bedside his two 
sons and said. " My sons, there is a great treasure lying hidden in 
one of my vineyards." thus hoping to secure the same attention to 
his farm from his sons that he had given to it. The sons, after 
the burial of their father, took their farming tools and upturned 
every portion of the land, but found no treasure. The vines, how- 
ever, repaid all they had done with an extraordinary crop. 

Moral. — The treasury of man is labor.

THE MASTER AND HIS DOGS. 

A MAN, weathei -bound in his country home, was obliged to kill 
his sheep and his goats and his pigs, to keep his family from starv- 
ing. Tho storm continuing he was compelled to kill his working 
oxen, which his dogs observing, took counsel among themselves 
and said, " We must be off, for if he spares not his oxen who work 
for him, what can we expect?" 

Moral. — He is to be shunned who does not spare his own. 



THE FOX WHO HAD LOST HIS TAIL. 

A fox having his tail caught in a trap lost it. Feeling that his 
loss would bring him into ridicule, he assembled a number of 
foxes and publicly advised them to have their tails cut off, saying 
that they would not only appear better, but that they would get 
rid of a great weight and inconvenience. One of them, interrupt- 
ing him, said, " If you had not lost your tail, you would not thus 
counsel us." 

Moral. — The advice of bad men is not dictated by kindness, but 
by their own interest. 



MERCURY AND THE SCULPTOR. 

Mercury, wishing to know the world's opinion of himself, as- 
sumed the form of a man, and visited the home of a sculptor. 
Seeing the statues of Jupiter and Juno, he asked the sculptor for 
what sum he would cut them. The price being named, he pointed 
to a figure of himself, and said, " You certainly ask more for this." 
" Well," replied the sculptor, " If you buy these two, I will throw 
that into the bargain." 

Moral. — Self-glorification is of little value. 



THE WOLF AND THE CRANE. 

A wolf, having a bone in his throat, hired a crane, for a large 
reward, to put her head into his throat and draw out the bone. 
When tho crane had done what she had promised, and asked for 
payment, the wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed, 
" Why! you have already been paid. I permitted you to draw 
your head out of my mouth without biting it off, as I might have 
done, had I chosen." 

Moral. — When you serve the wicked, expeot no reward, and be 
thankful if you escape injury for your pains.

JONAS WHITCOMB'S ASTHMA REMEDY *'£#£;'%£" 

THE WOMAN AND THE WOLF. 

A wolf one morning prowling around in search of food, as he 
passed a hut in the woods heard a woman say to a child, " Be quiet, 
or I will give you to wolf, and he shall eat you." The wolf waited 
all day, and in the evening hoard the same woman fondling the 
child, and saying, " He is quiet now, and if the wolf comes we will 
kill him." The wolf returned to his den, when the she wolf asked 
him why he had returned without his usual prey. "Why! Because 
I took a woman at her word." 

Mokal. — The moral is apparent. 



THE WOMAN AND HER MAIDS. 

A widow had two maids, whom she was in the habit of waking 
at cockcrow in the morning. Aggrieved by such a course, the 
maids resolved to kill the cock, but when they had done so, their 
mistress, no longer hearing the time from the crow of the cock, 
woke them up to their work in the middle of the night. 

Mokal. — The plans of most men are causes of evil to them. 



THE BOASTER. 

A max who had travelled much, on his return to his native land 
boasted of many wonderful things he had performed during his 
absence. He said that while he was in Rhodes he leaped a distance 
that no other person could equal, and that citizens of Rhodes stood 
ready to prove it. " Now, my good fellow," said a bystander, " if 
all this be true, suppose this to be Rhodes. Now for your leap." 

Moral. — Words without deeds are vain. 



THE THIEF AND HIS MOTHER. 

A bot stole a book from a schoolmate, and took it home to his 
mother. This was his first theft, but under his mother's com- 
mendation he continued to pilfer till he reached man's estate, 
when, at last he was taken in the act, and led away to public exe- 
cution. His mother followed, (caring her hair in sorrow, whereon 
the young man said, "I wish to say something to my mother in 
her car." She approached him, when, seizing her ear in his teeth 
he bit it off. Upbraiding him for his unnatural act, he replied, 
" Ah, if you had corrected me when I first stole the school-book, I 
should not have come to this disgraceful end." 

Mokal. — Those whose vices are not corrected in youth after- 
wards suffer greater calamities. 

Ask for TULIP SOAP, and insist upon having it.

THE FOX AND THE GOAT. 

A fox having fallen into a well could find no means of escape, 
when a goat coming to quench his thirst, and seeing the fox, 
asked him if the water was good. The fox replied that it was ex- 
cellent and advised him to descend. The goat jumped down, 
when the fox informed him of the sad fix they both were in, and 
suggested away of escape for them both. " If you will place your 
fore feet against the wall, and incline your head, I will runup your 
back and then help you out. The goat assented to this, and the 
fox, reaching the top of the well scampered off as fast as he could. 
The goat reproached him for his want of honesty, when he turned 
around and cried out, " You old dunce, if you had as many brains 
as you have hairs in your beard you never would have gone down 
before examining the way back." 

Moral. — It is always best to look before you leap. 



THE DOG AND THE COOK. 

A certain man gave a supper, to which he invited many of his 
friends. His dog availing himself of the occasion, said to another 
dog: " My master gives a feast to-night; come and sup with me, 
and together we will have a good time." The dog thus invited ap- 
peared at the time appointed, saying, in the height of his anticipa- 
tion: " I'm glad I came, as I do not often get such a chance as this. 
/' 11 eat enough to last me a long time." While thus congratula- 
ting himself, wagging his tail in expression of pleasure to his 
friend, the cook espied him, and without any ceremony threw him 
jut the window. His yelping attracted other street dogs, who 
asked him how he enjoyed his supper. " Why, to tell you the 
/ruth," said he, "I drank so much wine that I remember nothing. 
It puzzles me how I got out of the house." 

Moral. — Uninvited guests seldom meet a welcome. 



THE HORSE AND THE ASS. 

Once upon a time a horse and an ass journeying together, the 
ass said to his companion, " If you wish me to finish this journey 
with you, you must take a portion of my load." To this tlie horse 
did not agree, and the ass falling under his heavy burden, died. 
The horse was then ladened with all the ass's load, and with the 
skin of the ass also. Lamenting his fate, the horse exclaimed, 
" Alas for me; because I refused to bear a portion of the ass's load 
I am compelled to carry all of it, and the skin of the dead ass 
also." 

Moral. — If the powerful divide the burdens of life with the 
weak, the fortunes of both will be better.

THE BOSTON HERALD, 

The average daily circulation of Ihe BOSTON HERALD is larger than 
the combined circulation of all other Boston Daily Papers. 

THE SUNDAY HERALD. 

Th? circulation of the SUNDA Y HERALD is more than the circulation 
of all other Boston Sunday Papers combint d. 



THE BOSTON HERALD is the only newspaper in Boston whose circulation 
is regularly and conspicuously printed at the head of its columns. This 
custom its proprietors have followed since the time when the circulation was 
less than OO.OOO. They have never found it expedient or necessary to pay for 
the publication of articles of news (?) chronicling in general terms "enormous 
gains," or gains in percentage. They have never found it necessary to state the 
circulation in any way, except by simple, direct, actual figures. The •normous 
circulation of the Daily Herald and the Sunday Herald has been earned by 
honest merit ; 1>\ a lavish expenditure of money in obtaining and publishing the 
mosl complete news reports, and the best editorial thought ; by an adequate per- 
ception of what matter the intelligent reading public desires to read ; by abso- 
lute independence in political and religious discussions.

THE TRAVELERS AND THE AXE. 

Two men traveling together, one of them picked up an axe by 
the wayside, and said, "I have found an axe," "Don't say so," re- 
plied his companion, "Don't say /, say toe have found it." Soon 
they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them, and he who had 
picked it up said, "We are undone." "No! no!" said the other ; 

stick to your text, say ' / am undone, not we.' " 

Moral. — He who shares the danger is entitled to a share of the 
prize. 



THE YOUTHS AND THE COOK. 

Two young men visited a cook, and while he was engaged over 
the fire, one of them stole a piece of tripe and hid it in the bosom 
of the other. The cook asking for the meat, the one who had 
taken it swore that he did not have it, and the one who had it 
swore he did not take it. The cook seeing through their dishon- 
esty, said, " Though you may deceive me, you will not deceive your 
God." 

Moral. — Although men may escape human judgment, it is im- 
possible for them to avoid Divine justice. 



THE MAN AND THE BROKEN STATUE. 

A poor man, possessed of a wooden image of Mercury, to which 
he offered daily worship, besought it to make him rich. His 
prayers being unanswered he got mad, and knocked the image 
over, when in its fall it broke to pieces and from it a stream of 
gold came forth. This the man quickly grasped, and said, " You 
are altogether obstinate and unnatural, for when I render honors 
to you, you notice me not, but that now I knock you over you load 
me with riches." 

Moral. — To worship an evil is profitless, Strike it down and 
the advantage soon appears. 



THE TWO DOGS. 

A man owned a hound he used in the chase, and a mastiff he 
kept as a watch for his house. When he returned from a day's 
sport he always gave to the mastiff a large share of his game. 
The hound aggrieved at such a course, said to his companion, " It 
is too bad that you, after all my labor in the hunt, thus luxuriate 
on the results of it." "Don't blame me; the fault is with your 
master," replied the mastiff; " he did not teach me to labor, but 
to depend for my existence on the labor of others." 

Moral. — Men should not be punished for the faults of their 
superiors.

MERCURY AND THE WOODCHOPPERS. 

A woodchopper at work by the side of a stream, dropped his 
axe into the water, and sitting down upon the bank lamented las 
fate. Mercury appeared and asked him the cause <>f liis trouble, 
ami on being informed plunged into the stream and brought up a 
golden axe. Inquiring of the woodman if it was the one he had 
lost, the woodman said no, and again Mercury disappeared beneath 
the water, and returned with a silver axe. "is this yours? " de- 
manded Mercury. The workman again saying it was not, Mer- 
cury dived for the third time, and brought up the axe that was 
lost. On the workman expressing his joy for its recovery. Mer- 
cury admiring Ids honesty, gave him the golden and silver axes as 
Well as his own. 

On returning to his home he told all his fellows of what had 
happened, and one Of them thought he would try and see if he 

could not, gain the same good fortune. Running to the river he 
threw his axe into it ami sat down weeping. Mercury appeared 
to him, and learning the cause of his grief plunged into the water 

and brought up a golden axe, at the same time asking the work- 
man if "ne had lost it. The workman hastily seized it and declared 
that it was the one he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his 
knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to re- 
cover the one he had purposely thrown into the river. 

MORAL. — God, as much as he assists the just, so much he thwarts 
the unjust.

at the Paris Exposition, 1878, and at the Centennial, 1876. 

Their deserved reputation for 

Excellence of Fabric, Richness and Dura-

of Design, 

has led to frequent infringements, and inferior goods have 
often been palmed off in their stead. For the protection of 
the public, the Company has adopted as a trade-mark the 
word " BIGELOW," which will be woven (at every repeat 
<of the pattern) in white capitals into the back of the fabric. 
Customers will therefore have merely to examine the back 
of a Carpet to be certain that they are getting the genuine

By the above you will notice that the first part of the address of 
Whittemore Bros. & Co., Boston, Mass. — is in as few words as 
possible, and is not confusing to the Post-office authorities while the 
letter is being forwarded. The balance of the address is placed to 
one side, and after reaching Boston the carriers have no trouble in 
delivering to the proper street and number. 

If addressed to a small village, write beneath it the name of the 
county. 

There are no two Post-offices of the same name in any State, but 

the same name occurs in different states, as "Bath, Maine," "Bath,

To Fold tiie Mitre. — If the napkin is square, fold once, in- 
to an oblong one third longer than wide. Lay three folds, like 
the letter Z, preserving the length. Fold both ends to the middle, 
meeting underneath. Turn the left hand upper corner square to 
the lower edge and the right hand lower corner square to 
the upper edge. You should now have Fig. 1. Now fold in 
halves the long way ; open the points of the mitre, and you should 
have Fig. 2. Bend the left-hand point to the right, and tuck in a 
fold, and the right-hand point in the opposite direction and tuck 
in. You should now have Fig. 3, or the Bishop's Mitre. 

To Fold the Call a.— Fold a square napkin like a half hand- 
kerchief. Fold the opposite points to meet on the centre point. 
Boll the bottom corner as in Fig. 4. Turn the napkin over, and roll

SOUPS. 

Of all the operations of cookery none is more important, nor 
usually more negligently executed, than the preparation of soups. Set- 
ting aside the consideration of economy, to begin dinner with a light 
soup is decidedly wholesome, and serves to divert the danger of eating 
too heavily of solid meat. It is an error for any one to fancy that 
when he has eaten heartily of roast beef only, he has necessarily 
made a wholesome dinner. The richest soups are made by boiling sev- 
eral kinds of meat together, as beef, mutton and veal. — Mrs. Hastings. 

Beef Soup Stock. — Take a shank of beef and cut the meat in 
fine pieces; take out the marrow and with a piece of butter put into 
a kettle; put over the fire, and when hot add the meat and cook till 
brown, then add the bones and sufficient hot water to cover; boil four 
hours, strain and set away to cool. — 31rs. Iloyt. 

Beef Soup. — Take sufficient soup stock; boil onion, carrot, pota- 
toes and vegetables to suit taste, in a little water, and strain into the 
soup stock; add pepper, salt, etc., to suit. — Mrs. Smith. 

Tomato Soup.— Put three pints of tomatoes, stewed, strained 
and sweetened, to two quarts of beef stock ; add an onion, salt and 
pepper. — Mrs. Loioell. 

Pea Soup. — Take a pint of split peas and, w T hen carefully picked 
over and washed, put them into a pint of water; soak in morning; 
three hours before dinner put them into a pot with a quart more 
water and about half a pound of pork (less if you wish the soup not 
very rich); boil it steadily and be careful to stir it often lest it should 
burn. It may need more water before dinner and can be made of 
whatever thickness you prefer. If you prefer to have the soup with- 
out pork, use the liquor in which the beef or other fresh meat has 
been boiled, instead of water, and use no pork. — Mrs. Wright. 

Soup Maigke. — Melt half a pound of butter in a stewpan, slice 
six onions into it, add two heads of celery, cut small, one small cab- 
bage, and a bunch of parsley, cut small; shake these together over 
the fire for fifteen minutes, then stir in three rolled crackers; add 
further, two quarts of boiling milk or water and pepper and salt to 
taste; let it boil gently for three-quarters of an hour, then take it from 
the fire, stir into it two well beaten eggs, and serve. — Mrs. Stetson. 

Oyster Soup. — Put a gallon of water to a knuckle of veal; boil 
it to two quarts; strain, add the juice of the oysters you are to use; 
add pepper and salt to your taste. Fifteen minutes before taking it 
up, put in the oysters, also eight rolled crackers, and after it stops 
boiling add half a pint of milk. — Mrs. Hastings. 

Vermicelli Soup. — Swell quarter of a pound of vermicelli in 
a quart of warm water, then add it to a good beef, veal, lamb or 
chicken soup or broth, with quarter of a pound of sweet butter; let 
the soup boil for fifteen minutes after it is added. — Mrs. Hosmer. 

In soup making the greatest care is necessary that the vessel for it 
be perfectly clean and free from any grease or sand. — Mrs. Wilson. 

To Season and Color Soups use Madame Perrin's "Pate 
Francaise" (French Paste), esteemed in the European cuisine, and 
highly recommended by Miss Parloa as an indispensable auxiliary 
for soups and brown gravies. Dealers supplied by Jas. A. Hayes

Preparing this Powder ourselves, from selected flowers of our own impor- 
tation, from Dalmatia, Austria, we are enabled to obtain much better results 
than are possible from powder prepared abroad. A single trial will establish 
this fact. 

One of the largest wholesale houses in the country writes : " We rind yours 
the only Insect Powder concerning which we never hare any question or com- 
plaint." 

Another wholesaler, who hist year sold five thousand pounds, is this year, 
although the season has hardly began, selling at the rate of over ten thousand 
pounds. 

Our Flowers (bought for us by our agent in Dalmatia) we import direct to 
Boston at an i vpense for freight of only half a cent a pound. This we think better 
and cheaper than buying through New York brokers or importers ; our trade 
last year largely exceeding ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS.

FISH. 

It is necess.oay to use more care in boiling fish than it is meat; 
for after it is once done, it takes very little to crack and break it, 
and thus make it appear, as it indeed would be, bad cooking; and 
if it is not done enough, it is still worse cooking. Before putting 
the fish into the kettle to boil, soak it ten or fifteen minutes in salt 
and water, and then not use any salt as you cook it. Boiled in this 
way, it will require less skimming, look nicer, anu eat nicer. Boil 
slowly in water enough to two-thirds cover. When the eyes turn 
white and the skin cracks, the fish is done enough. 

Baked Fish. — Take a large fish; remove scales by pouring 
boiling water over it; scrape with a knife. Make a dressing of 
bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and one or two onions ; season with 
salt and pepper, add a beaten egg, and mix with milk or water. 
Put as much as possible into the fish, fill up the body and about 
the gills, and sew up. Score the fish across and lay very thin 
slices of salt pork over it. Put a little water in your baking pan, 
lay the fish on a grate, and bake in a very hot oven three quarters 
of an hour or more. Make a gravy from the drippings in your 
pan, thicken a little, and add a cup of cream while it is cooking. 

Codfish Balls. — Take a codfish, either salt or fresh, that has 
been boiled; remove the bones carefully and mince the fish; mix 
with it some mashed potatoes, one third codfish and two thirds 
potatoes; season with butter and pepper, and mix all together un- 
til quite smooth. If it seems dry, moisten with a little cream or 
milk, or the beaten yolk of an egg. Make into small cakes, sprinkle 
with fiour and fry in hot lard to a nice brown. Send to table hot. 

Fried Fish. — Sake a slice of fish, sprinkle with salt, and 
dredge with flour. Fry four slices of salt pork; add to the pork 
fat one spoonful of lard. When boiling hot put in the fish; fry a 
light brown on one side, then turn over and fry the same on the 
other. Serve pork with it. 

To Boil Halibut. — Take a piece weighing four or five 
pounds ; scrape the skin clean ; dredge flour over it and boil accord- 
ing to its weight, ten minutes to a pound. Serve with plain boiled 
potatoes and drawn butter, or egg or parsley sauce. 

Smelts. — Season crackers, and dust with pepper and salt; 
wash the smelts and dry them; dip them in beaten egg, then in the 
seasoned crackers. Fry a light brown in boiling lard. 

Broiled Fish. — Grease the gridiron with a little butter; place 
the fish upon it, sprinkle a little salt over it and place it over clear 
coal. Cook one side ten minutes, and then turn and cook 
upon the other side ten minutes. Have the dish warm; put 
the fish upon it, season with pepper and butter, and send to the 
table.

SHELL FISH. 

Scalloped Oysteks. — Sprinkle a buttered dish with bread or 
cracker crumbs, then put in a layer of oysters, lay on bits of but- 
ter, sprinkle over a little pepper and salt, and so on until the dish 
is full, leaving the crumbs on top; moisten with the liquor from 
the oysters. Bake half an hour in a quick oven. 

Stewed Lobster. — Take one-half pint milk and stir in it enough 
flour to make it quite thick, put it on the fire till it boils; remove, 
and stir in quite a large piece of butter. Chop the lobster, and 
season to taste with salt, vinegar and pepper, and then put it in 
the dressing, and let it simmer on the stove. 

Fried Oysters. — One cup flour, one tea-spoonful butter rubbed 
through it, one tea-spoonful yeast powder, one-half tea-spoonful 
salt, one tea-spoonful sugar, stir them well together; then add one 
cup milk and two well beaten eggs; have the hatter as stiff as for 
griddle cakes. Take one quart well cleaned oysters and mix with 
the batter, and fry in plenty of hot lard. 

Oyster Pie. — Take seventy-five oysters with the liquor and one 
pint hot water, set over fire, and let them boil five minutes; re- 
move oysters with skimmer, add one pint milk to the liquor; when 
it comes to a boil, thicken with one-half cup flour in one-half cup 
milk, add a quarter pound butter, salt and pepper to taste. Roll 
out puff paste and cut it size of dish for top and bottom, and bake 
it before oysters are prepared ; place the paste in the dish, pour 
in the mixture, and cover with the top paste. 

Pickled Oysters. — Rinse the oysters in their liquor, strain it 
upon them, and let them come to a boil; then take them out of 
the liquor to cool. Prepare pure cider vinegar by boiling it with 
peppers, a little salt, mace, cloves and nutmeg, and when perfect- 
ly cold pour it over the oysters, and keep them in a covered stone 
jar. 

Clam Chowder. — Butter a deep tin basin; strew it thickly with 
grated bread crumbs or soaked crackers; sprinkle some pepper 
over and bits of butter the size of a hickory nut, and, if liked, 
some parsley chopped fine; then put a double layer of clams; seas- 
on with pepper; put bits of butter over them, then another layer 
of soaked cracker; after that clams and bits of butter; sprinkle 
pepper over; add a cup of milk or water, and lastly a layer of 
soaked crackers; turn a plate over the basin and bake in a hot 
oven three quarters of an hour; use half a pound of soda biscuit 
and a quarter of a pound of butter with fifty clams. 

Devilled Lobster. — Extract the meat from a boiled lobster 
and mince it fine; season high with mustard, cayenne pepper, and 
salpicant or curry powder; salt it, and stir until well mixed; then 
put it in a porcelain saucepan (covered) with just enough water 
to keep it from burning; let it boil up once, and stir in two tea- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and a large table-spoonful of butter; let it 
boil up once and serve.

MEATS. 

Breast of Mutton. — Put it into cold water; as it boils, care- 
fully skim, and let it simmer about two hours. It may be served 
with caper sauce or white onion sauce, The vegetables should 
be turnips and potatoes or turnips and spinach. 

Sirloin of Beef. — Get a good, nice, ripe joint, put it into the 
pan with a little dripping; as soon as the dripping is melted, baste, 
and continue basting every quarter of an hour till about half an 
hour before the meat is done; then dredge with flour and sprinkle 
with salt, and roast until done. Do not baste for a quarter of an 
hour after dredging. 

Ribs of Beef. — Cook the same as sirloin, only when about half 
done place it the other side up, and dredge slightly, and sprinkle 
on salt. Then dredge again half an hour before it is done. 

Mutton — Requires a brisk fire. When half done, dredge it and 
sprinkle on salt, and when nearly done do so again. Roast slowly 
at first, and then faster, as before directed. 

Lamb — Should be well done, but be sure not to hurry it at first; 
towards the end, you may roast quickly. It must be basted at 
first at least every quarter of an hour ; dredge with flour fifteen 
minutes before it is done. 

How to Boil. — The main secret in boiling meats so that they 
will have a richness both in taste and appearance, is as follows : 
A slight washing in lukewarm water, using a clean pot that is 
about large enough to hold the meat without its touching the 
sides, and clean water enough to fairly cover the meat. Have the 
pot cover fit snugly. Put it over a fairly good fire, and as it comes 
to a boil, skim it carefully; be sure not to let it stop boiling until 
it is done, but do not let it boil fast. 

Leg of Lamb. — Put it into a pot with cold water enough to 
cover it, and skim carefully as long as the skum rises. Upon its 
being boiled slowly depends its goodness. Five pounds weight 
will take about one find a half hours. It may be served with peas, 
greens, asparagus, or spinach, and potatoes. Butter and parsley 
for the meat, and melted butter for the vegetables, make good 
sauces for boiled lamb. 

Corned Beef.— A piece of brisket or a thick flank weighing 
about six pounds should take about two hours and a half of slow 
boiling. The length of time for other pieces will be according to 
the size and firmness, and for that reason difficult to state. Should 
have a good supply of boiled carrots, potatoes and greens. They 
should be served in separate dishes. Place some sliced carrots 
around the meat. It intended to use cold, let the meat stop in the 
kettle until cold, and then press. When it is pressed hot, it loses 
some of its juice, and does not cut, look, or eat as well as when 
allowed to cool in the liquor and then pressed.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



Broiled Chicken, Quail or Woodcock. — Get tender ones. 
Take the breasts of the chicken or quail, or the thighs of the wood- 
cock. Place on hot coals or on a broiler, turning often to avoid 
burning. When done, remove the burned parts, if any, season 
slightly with salt and pepper (no butterl and turn upon a piece of 
freshly made toast. Place between two hot plates and serve directly. 

Many limes a small but choice piece of tenderloin steak is highly 
enjoyed, and more wholesome for an invalid than broths or tea« ; and 
tbe same may be said of a tender mutton chop. Serve either of 
these with a potato baked, and dressed with a little sweet cream and 
salt. Have the meat broiled carefully a few minutes, turn often, — 
but do not pierce it with the fork — season with salt and pepper (no 
butter) and serve upon toast, as directed previously. 

Boiled Turkey. — Take a turkey and clean, stuff, and truss it as 
if for roasting. Can use oysters for stuffing if preferred. Put into 
boiling water, salted, and allow about twenty minutes to the pound. 
Serve with oyster sauce. 

Pottixg Fowls. — For potting fowls, birds or game clean the 
meat from the bones, and pound with spices; boil the bones to a 
glaze, and moisten the pounded meat with this. Before potting, 
run the mass through a sieve. Press the meat firmly into the jars, 
and set them in boiling water in a covered stew-pan ; steam thus half 
an hour. Press the meat down again firmly; wipe dry and cover 
with hot butter, or a coarse flour paste. 

Pressed Chickex. — Boil one or two chickens in a small quantity 
of water, with a little salt; when thoroughly done, take all the meat 
from the bones, keeping the light and dark meat separate; chop fine 
and season. Put in a pan a layer of dark and light meat; add the 
liquor it was boiled in, which should be about a cupful. Press with 
a small weight. When cold, cut in slices. 

To Roast Partridges. — Pick, draw, singe and clean them the 
same as fowls. Make a slit in the neck and draw out the craw; 
twist the neck round the wing, and bring the head round to the side 
of the breast. The legs and wings are trussed the same as fowls, 
only the feet are left on and crossed over one another. Put them 
down to a clear fire and baste well with butter. When about half 
done dust a little flour over them ; let them be nicely browned. They 
will require to roast from twenty minutes to half an hour each. 
Serve on toasted bread dipped in gravy, with gravy and bread sauce.

Chicken Salad. — Have cold roasted or boiled chicken free from 
skin, fat and bones. Place on a board, and cut in long, thin strips 
and cut these into dice. Place in an earthen bowl (there should be 
two quarts), and season with four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, two of 
oil, one teaspoonful of salt, and one-half of a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Set away in a cold place for two or three hours. 

Scrape and wash enough of the tender white celery to make one 
quart. Cut this with a sharp knife in pieces about half-an-inch thick. 
Put these in the ice chest until serving time. Mix the chicken and 
celery together, and add a portion of the dressing. Arrange in a 
salad bowl or on a flat dish, and pour over it enough dressing to suit 
the taste. Garnish with white celery leaves. Or, have a jelly border, 
and arrange the salad in this. 

Lobster Salad. — Cut up and season the lobster the same as 
chicken. Break the leaves from a head of lettuce, one by one, and 
wash them singly in a large pan of cold water. Put in a pan of ice 
water for ten minutes, and then shake in a wire basket to free them 
from water. Place in the ice chest until serving time. When ready 
to serve, put two or three leaves together in the form of a shell, and 
arrange these shells on a flat dish. Mix a portion of the dressing 
with the lobster. Put a tablespoonful of this in each cluster of leaves. 
Finish with a teaspoonful of the dressing on each spoonful of lobster. 
There should be two-thirds lobster to one-third lettuce.. 

Salmon Salad. — To one quart of cooked salmon two heads of 
lettuce. Make the same as lobster salad. 

Asparagus Salad. — Boil two bunches of asparagus in one quart 
of water and one tablespoonful of salt, for twenty minutes. Take 
up and drain on a sieve When cold, cut off the tender points and 
arrange them on the dish. Pour on the salad dressing. 

Potato Salad. — One quart of potatoes, two tablespoonfuls of 
grated onion, two of chopped parsley, four of chopped beet, and 
enough dressing to make moist. Pare and cut the potatoes in thin 
slices while hot. Mix the other ingredients with them, and put away 
in a cool place until serving time. This is better for standing two or 
three hours. 

Tomato Salad. — Pare ripe tomatoes (which should be very cold), 
and cut in thin slices. Arrange on a fiat dish. Put one teaspoonful 
of the dressing in the centre of each slice. Place a delicate border 
of parsley around the dish, and a sprig here and there between the 
slices of tomato.

Diimott'e Evtr'into Housekeepers should insist upon obtaining them; 
DUllltSlI O LAlldlilO. they are perfectly pure and of great strength. 

VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables, as a rule, require enough water to swim in, and to cover 
them ; they should also be boiled by themselves. The water should 
be boiling. Put in a pinch of salt, then the vegetables, and boil until 
they are tender, Do not leave them in after they are done, for after 
that they begin to lose flavor, and very soon spoil. Be sure, how- 
ever, they are done tender. 

Potatoes, which are good with all meats, should have the water 
poured off the moment they are done, the lid taken partly off, and the 
kettle set back upon the stove until the potatoes are dry and mealy. 

Carrots, parsnips, turnips and cabbages, as well as greens, are 
eaten with boiled and roast meats. Tomatoes are good with all kinds 
of meats. Beets and carrots are best when boiled thoroughly, and 
eaten hot with butter. Peas and Lima beans are best when a little of 
the liquid in which they are boiled is left, and richly seasoned. Mint 
sauce should always be served with roast lamb, and pickles with fish. 

Stewed Potatoes. — Take cold boiled potatoes and cut them up 
quite small; put them into the pan; add some milk, salt ami pepper 
to taste, dredge them with flour, and boil slowly until the milk 
becomes thick; then put in considerable butter, and serve hot. 

To P.oil Potatoes. — Take those of about one size ; be very care- 
ful to wash well, otherwise they will have an unpleasant flavor. Pnt 
tlv m into cold water enough to cover all. add half a handful of salt, 
ami boil slowly until done, which will be from thirty to sixty minutes, 
according to size. When a fork goes easily to the heart, they are 
done ; then follow the directions as given in remarks under vegetables. 

Fkenx'ii Dish. — Take cold boiled potatoes, cut them into very thin 
slices, and simmer them in a little plain gravy. Take a small piece of 
butter, and stir into it a little flour; also use a little chopped paisley, 
pepper and salt. 

Asparagus. — Tie in small bunches, but not very tight; put into 
boiling water, and cook about half on hour. Serve hot upon toast 
with butter. 

Cauliflower. — Strip off the leaves, separate, and soak for about 
an hour in salt and water, heads downward. Boil in fresh water 
until lender; drain in a colander, season to taste, and serve with 
butter. 

Stijixo Beans require one hour's boiling; drain through a colan- 
der, put in salt and butter, and keep hot while dishing the meat.

FLEISCHMANN & CO.'S RECIPES. 



BREAD. 

White Bread. — For use in the morning. — Makes four loaves. Dissolve 
thoroughly one cake of Compressed Yeast in a quart of lukewarm water, and 
stir in sifted flour until the mixture is a little thicker than griddle cake batter. 
Set in a warm place, free from draft, until it rises and begins to go back. The 
sponge is then complete. Add to the sponge one pint of lukewarm water, one 
tabiespoonf ul of salt, two of sugar, and same of butter ; add sifted flour enough 
to make a dough as soft AS CAN be handled. Knead well. When thoroughly 
light, knead, make into loaves, and place in well-greased pans for final rising. 
This last kneading should be very thorough. When light, bake, remembering 
that it will "spring " still more in the oven. When baked, lean it against some- 
thing, throw a cloth over it, and cool by contact with the air on all sides. 

t^W We advise all to use Morning Directions at first, as this Yeast is quicker 
than any other known. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Dissolve one cake of Compressed Yeast in three-

HAITI RECEIPTS. 

The size of a ham has much to do with the way in which it should 
be served. A whole ham will boil more satisfactory than a part of it. 
For broiling or frying never use a ham of less than 12 pounds, and 
one weighing 15 or 1(5 is better still for this purpose. Only the centre 
of such -a ham, hoviever, should be sliced. Take off at least two 
inches from the large end of the ham in one cut. Then slice up the 
remainder as it is needed, until the upper joint in the bone is 
reached. This shank, with the other end first taken off, may be used 
to advantage, as suggested below. (See ''Economical Delicacies.") 

Fok Broiling on Frying. — Having taken off the large end as 
directed above, cut from each side of the bam cleanly to the bone, 
dividing the slices in the centre; thus you will avoid the necessity of 
siwing the bone. The slices should never be cutmore than one-fourth 
of an inch thick, and one-sixth of an inch is still letter. A very 
sha>-p knife must be used. Trim very closely the skin from the 
upper side of each slice, and also cut from the other edge the outer 
rim of both muscle and fat that has been somewhat hardened by 
smoking. If on trial the cure proves too salt, put these slices in cold 
water for one hour before cooking; then dry them carefully with a 
napkin. Never use tepid or hot water for this purpose, as it will 
toughen the meat. 

A brisk hot fire is needed, but it must not be fierce enough to 
scorch the meat. 

Have the broiler or the frying pan already warmed, but do not put 
the meat in until the family sit at the table. Then cook briskly, 
turning the slices frequently. Three minutes with such afire as we 
have indicated will give these thin slices ample cooking. Dish at 
once on a warm plate (it must not be hot or it will toughen the ham) 
with a little butter on each slice. Avoid using high salted butter, 
however. Neuer allow sliced ham to be cooked until the moment it 
is to be eaten, for when, after cooking it is left by the fire to wait and 
"keep warm," it will speedily toughen, losing all its grateful juices, 
and only a species of leather will remain. 

Economical Delicacies. — After using the choicest central cuts 
for broiling or frying, the ends of the bam may be made equally attract- 
ive and valuable. Boil them slowly and thoroughly — this is essen- 
tial; then take out the bone, carefully trim off the skin and the entire 
outer surface and any bits through the meat that may have become 
discolored by exposure to the air. This is very necessary. Chop the 
fat and lean together, thoroughly mixing them until they are cut to 
the size of small peas. The remnants of a ham once served boiled 
can, of course, be as well used in this way. 

Ham Omelet. — Put a proper quantity of ham, chopped as above, 
into the frying pan, pouring over it enough of eggs (which have pre- 
viously been well beaten with a small cup of milk) to make a 
generous omelet, stir thoroughly, and as soon as the egg stiffens, 
dish, and send smoking hot to the table. 

Ham Croquettes. — Chop the ham finer than for preceding uses 
and season with pepper or mustard. With a little flour in hand make 
up small balls and dip in beaten egg, roll in crumbs of bread or 
cracker, and fry to a light b rown in hot lard. 

Ask for TULIP SOAP, and insist upon having it. 



A WORD OF ADVICE 

ABOUT 

SPOOL COTTON. 



Few people understand the extent to which consumers of 
low-priced Spool Cotton (such as is retailed at two or three 
cents a spool) are defrauded by short measure. Much that 
is labelled •' 200 yards " does not contain over 130 yards, and 
some even less. Another way of cheapening the cost is to 
finish a cheap two-ply yarn, and spool it like three-cord thread. 

In imitation French threads marked " 500 metres," the 
frauds are often still greater. It is well to state that, on most 
of this class of thread, the makers are properly ashamed to 
place their names. Dealers sell them because they pay a 
better profit, even if sold at a lower price than an honest 
thread, and do not expect the cheat to be discovered — for 
what lady was ever known to measure a spool of thread ? 

BY PURCHASING HOLYOKE THREAD, 

You are protected against any such imposition as is referred 
to above; the makers — whose name is on every spool — 
guaranteeing it to be three-cord in every number, and warrant 
each spool to contain 200 yards of thread ; and it is, unques- 
tionably, cheaper for you at three cents a spool than most 
makes are at two cents. 

ASK FOR HOLYOKE THREAD, 

And insist on its being supplied to you, and see that a poorer 
article is not imposed on you instead cf it, from interested 
motives.

A GREAT DISCOVERY. 

Interesting to wearers of Corsets. 

TRICORA, a Material of South American Growth, known as " Tricora." 

THE BEST CORSET STAY EVER DISCOVERED. 

The TRICORA RELIEF CORSET (boned with Tricora Stays) 
has inaugurated an era of eomfort for Ladies. 

In its construction, elegance of shape has been carefully 
looked after. The peculiar features of the " Tricora Relief," 
which afford so much ease in wearing, are the elasticity of 
its sections, at the upper and lower parts of the sides, 
causing easy adaptation in every position which the body 
can assume, while its inelastic waist, and perfection of bust, 
gives an elegance of figure to the wearer, and the " Tricora 
Stays," while pliable and supporting, are 
absolutely unbreakable. 

The Tricora Relief Corset, having made such wonderful 
strides in public favor, may be considered due, chiefly, to 
to the facts that its relieving: features were originated, and 
its construction directed, 

BY ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST EMINENT FEMM.E SPECIALISTS, 

DR. ALEXANDER STRONG, 

which, together with the pliable, durable, and unbreakable 
character of the Tricora Stays used for boning, must secure 
for it a long continuance of the great favor it has already 
found, so universally, with the Ladies. 

Every Pair of Tricora Relief Corsets 
Are Warranted to give Satisfaction or Money Returned.

cream whipped to a stiff froth. 

Cranberry Pie. — Stew the fruit soft, then strain and sweeten 
to taste; use no spices. Add one beaten egg to each pie, that it 
may cut smooth. Use shallow plates with a lining and rim of 
pastry, and ornament the top with narrow strips. Bake until the 
crust is done. 

Cherry or Berry Pie. — Take a deep plate, and use very thin 
under crust. Allow a cup of sugar to a quart of fruit; use no spi- 
ces. Prick the upper crust to let out the steam. Stone the cher- 
ries.

beaten eggs. Set on ice till used. Serve in glass cups. 

Spanish Cream. — To one pint milk add one-third package of 
gelatine. Place over a kettle of boiling water. Beat the yolks of 
three eggs and four tablespoonfuls of sugar; stir into the milk; after 
the gelatine has dissolved, add a little salt. Stir constantly until it 
begins to thicken. Take from the fire, and add the whites of the 
eggs thoroughly beaten. Stir five minutes. Flavor, and put in a 
mould to cool. 

Jellitina. — One package of gelatine dissolved in one pint of cold 
water; let it stand twenty minutes. Then add one quart of boiling 
water, two cups of sugar, and juice of two lemons. Strain it into 
bowls. 

Soft Custard. — Boil a quart of milk, and beat up eight eggs with 
half a pound of sugar. Pour the milk on the eggs boiling hot, 
stirring the eggs at same time, and flavor with lemon or peach. Strain 
it through a fine sieve into a pitchev; set the pitcher in boiling water, 
and let it boil till it thickens. Stir it well; if it curdles, it is spoiled. 
Serve in custard glasses. 

Fruit for Dessert. — Beat well the white of an egg with a little 
water, dip the fruit in, and roll it immediately in powdered sugar; 
place it on a dish, and leave it five or six hours, then serve. A more 
beautiful and exquisite dessert than a plate of currants thus dressed 
cannot be had. 

Ice Cream. — One quart of milk (cream will make it much nicer), 
four eggs, and from half to three-quarters of a pound of powdered 
sugar. Beat the eggs and sugar well together, let the milk boil, then 
stir in the eggs; let it just come to a boil, strain, and flavor with 
either vanilla or lemon. Let it cool; then freeze. Stir frequently 
while freezing. 

Strawberry Ice Cream. — Take a quart of strawberries, hull 
them, and to each quart put half a pound of powdered sugar. Let it 
remain an hour, then strain, and mix with cream — one quart of 
berries to a quart of cream.

PRESERVES, PICKLES, ETC. 

Apple Preserve. — Take four pounds of brown sugar and melt, 
enough apples to make four pounds when sliced; add to the sugar 
when melted one ounce white giug-r root. Flavor with lemon. Cook 
till transparent. Makes nice filling for Washington pie. 

Pear Preserve. — Pare, cut in halves, core and weigh; if they ae 
hard, boil until tender, and use the water for the syrup. For each 
pound of pears use three-quarters pound sugar; bod a few minutes, 
then skim and cool; add the pears when lukewarm, and boil gently 
until they are penetrated by the syrup, and look clear; remove those 
that cook first. When all are done, take out the pears, boi down the 
syrup a little, and pour over them. A few cloves can be stuck in the 
pears, if liked, for flavoring. 

Grape Jam. — Separate the skin and pulp; boil the pulp enough to 
rub through a sieve, all but the seeds; then add the skin, and to 
every pound add three-quarters pound of sugar. Be careful and not 
burn. Let it boil until well cooked. 

Orange JELLY. — Take one ounce of gelatine, and dissolve in one 
pint of hot water. When sufficiently cool, add the juice of five or 
six oranges and two lemons - then strain, and let partially harden. 
Take the whiles of two eggs, beat, and add to the mixture; beat the 
whole five minutes or more, till stiff, then put in mould. 

Quince Jelly. — Slice the quinces without either paring or coring, 
put into preserving kettle, and cover with water; boil until soft, 
llemove from stove, and strain off the liquor; to every gallon add four 
pounds white sugar, and boil very fast until it becomes a stiff jelly. 

Pine-Apple Jam. — reel, grate, and weigh the pine-apple, and for 
each pound put pound sugar; boil in preserving kettle lroin half to 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Currant Jelly — Take the currants when fully ripe, mash, and 
then sijueeze through a cloth. To a pint of juice allow a pound of 
sugar, while is best. Boil gently for twenty or thirty minutes, lake 
a cup of cold water, and put in it a spoonful of the jelly; if boiled 
sufficiently, it will sink to the bottom of the cup in a solid mass. Put 
up iu small jars. 

Wine Jei.ly. — Two ounces of gelatine dissolved in one pint of 
cold water; soak one hour. Half pint wine — sherry is much the best 
— wine-glass brandy, juice of two lemons, half the rind of which 
grate, one and three-quarters pounds sugar. Pour three pints of 
boiling water over the above. Strain through a flannel jelly bag. 

Peach Preserve — Pare the peaches, and take out the stones; 
make a syrup, allowing one pound sugar to one pound fruit. Boil 
the fruit until clear. 

Quince Jam. — Peel the quinces, and grate them on a coarse grater; 
to one pint of quince add three-foun lis of a pound of sugar; boil it 
half au hour. Put into small jars, and seal.

It affords us pleasure to bring to your attention, through this medium 
our CELEBRATED BRAND of 

GOOD-WILL SOAR 

In certain localities it has already become as much of a household 
word as have the well-known maxims of Benjamin Franklin. 

In the first place, let us consider that question, which most of all should 
be taken into consideration in purchasing soap, viz. : its PURITY. This 
brand has been given our special attention and study, and we take upon 
ourselves the responsibility of asserting, beyond all hope of successful con- 
tradiction, that the 

GOODWILL SOA 

IS A 

Perfectly Pure, Unadulterated Soap, 

made of nothing but the BEST and CLEANEST STOCK. Thus we 
claim that no injury can or will be done to the finest skin, or the most 
delicate of fabrics. We think, therefore, that this fact alone, should of itself 
recommend this brand of Soap to every housekeeper. To every person 
that uses this Soap we would say, 

SATTE ITOim WRAPPERS. 

Send us twenty-five of the GOOD-WILL SOAP wrappers, 
with your name and address, and we will mail you FREE, our 
new Banner Picture, entitled "MEDITATION." 

This picture was designed especially for us by Messrs. Donaldson Bros, 
of New York City, and is as fine a picture as has ever been offered to the 
public as a premium. Size of Banner, 14x20 inches. 

DON'T FORGET THE NAME, 

GOOD-WILL SOAP.

JONAS WHITCOMB'S ASTHMA REMEDY tor ^fe? oM 

Head Carefully the following General Directions for 
Using Horsford's Baking Powder. 

Milk is always preferable to water, for mixing. Have the oven hot 
before mixing the dough. Do not knead the dough. Have the pans 
hot before putting the dough into them. The quicker the dough is put 
into the oven after being mixed, the better the result will be. 

BREAD, BISCUIT AND BOLLS. 

Sbortening may be used according to taste, but we recommend that 
none be used except where called for in the recipes. 

Water may be substituted for milk in the three following recipes for 
making biscuit, bread and rolls, and they will be found light and palat- 
able, and especially adapted to persons of weak digestive powers. 

Biscuit. — Take one quart sifted flour, loosely put in, two heaping 
teaspoonfuls Horsford's Baking Powder, one teaspoonful salt, sufli- 
cient sweet milk and water, or milk alone, to make a slack dougb, 
just stiff enough to handle. Shape with a spoon and the floured hand. 

Bread. — Follow the above directions, adding one-half gill more 
water. Cover the pan, which should be deep enough to allow the 
bread to rise without touching the cover.* When nearly done, the 
cover may be removed to brown the top of the loaf. 

Graham Polls. — As Graham flour should not be sifted, take one 
and one-half pints of Graham flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls Hors- 
ford's Baking Powder; add one teaspoonful salt. To one pint of 
water add half a gill of molasses, with which wet the flour. A well- 
beaten egg improves these rolls. Bake like white rolls, in gem pans. 

Waffles. — Take one quart flour, a teaspoonful salt, a tablespoon- 
ful melted butter, and milk enough to make a thick batter. Mix 
thoroughly; add two well-beaten eggs and two heaping teaspoonfuls 
Horsford's Baking Powder; stir well, and bake at once in waffle irons. 

Muffixs. — With one pint of milk and sufficient wheat flour, make 
a thick batter; add a little salt, a tablespoonful melted butter, two 
well-beaten eggs, two heaping teaspoonfuls Horsford's Baking Pow- 
der, and bake quickly in muffin rings. 

Good and Ciieap Pie Crust.— One quart sifted flour, one tea- 
spoonful salt, two heaping teaspoonfuls Horsford's Baking Powder; 
mix thoroughly together while dry, and sift; then add cold sweet 
milk enough to make a stiff dough, and roll out as usual. Use the 
''Pie Crust Glaze" on both the bottom and top crusts, as per follow- 
ing recipe. Some prefer less of the Baking Powder in pie crust; a 
trial will determine what quantity best suits your taste. 

HORSFORD'S BAKING POWDER 

Is put up in bottles of the usual sizes, with wide mouths to admit a 
teaspoon. Bottles are preferable to tin cans, as they are safer, cleaner, 
and preserve the strength of Baking Powder much better. For sale 
by all grocers. *

When I dig a man out of trouble, the hole that he leaves behind 
him is the grave where I bury my own trouble. 

To Preserve Bouquets.— Put a little saltpetre in the water you 
use for your bouquets, and the flowers will live for a fortnight. 

Canned Cidek. — Cider may be preserved perfectly sweet for years, 
by putting it up in air-tight cans, like those used for preserving fruit. 

Freparing New Linen for Embroidery.— New linen maybe 
embroidered more easily by rubbing it over with fine white soap, 
which prevents the threads from cracking. 

Ribbons and Silks should be put away for preservation in brown 
paper; the chloride of lime in white paper discolors them. A white 
satin dress should be pinned up in blue paper with brown paper out- 
side, sewn together at the edges. 

A Silver Tree. — Dissolve twenty grains of nitrate of silver in 
one fluid ounce of water in a phial, and add one half a drachm of 
pure quicksilver. Suspend a piece of zinc in the solution, and the 
silver will be precipitated upon it, forming a beautiful silver shrub 
or tree.

It is important that the Soda or Saleratus you use should be "WHITE and 
?URE, in common with all similar substances used for food. Some Soda may 
appear white when examined by itself, but a comparison with Church & i'o's 
ARM AND HAMMER BRAND'wM show the difference. In making bread with 
yeast, it is best to use about half a teaspoonful of Church & Co.'s ARM AND 
HAMMER BRAND Soda or Saleratus at the same time, and thus make the bread 
rise better, and prevent it from becoming sour, by correcting the natural acidity 
of the yeast. All good cook-books recommend this. 

FARMERS and DAIRYMEN should use only the ARM AND HAMMER 
BRAND for cleaning and keeping milk-pans sweet and clean. 
HOG DISEASES. 

The Arm and Hammer Brand Soda or Saleratus is now being used by farmer? 
with great success, for the prevention and cure of HOG CHOLERA and other 
diseases. Mix with animals' food.

To injure obtaining only the ARM AND HAIHUIER BRAINS

HINTS FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER. 

Our Morning Meal. — Breakfast should be th ; most enlivening 
meal of the whole day, for then we are to be nerved for another day's 
duties and cares, and perhaps for great sorrows also. Let there be no 
exciting argument, from which personalities may crop out, around the 
breakfast table. Let there be, if possible, only pleasant topics and 
affectionate salutations, that all may go forth their several ways with 
sweet, peaceful memories of each other; for some foot may never 
again cross the family threshold, some eye never witness another day's 
dawning. This thought, if the busy world was not so clamorous as 
to stifle it, would often arrest the impatient, fretful words that pain 
so many tender hearts. 

How to Put the Children to Bed.— Not with a reproof for any 
of that day's sins of omission or commission. Take any other time 
but bed-time for that. If you ever heard a little creature sighing or 
sobbing in its sleep, you could never do this. Seal their closing eye- 
lids with a kiss and a blessing. The time will come, all too soon, when 
they will lay their heads upon their pillows lacking both. Let them 
then at least have this sweet memory of a happy childhood, of which 
no future sorrow or trouble can rob them. 

Bringing up Children. — The very best method to bring up a 
child in the way he should go is to go in that way yourself. Be your- 
self that which you wish your child to be. Let the father and mother 
be civil, considerate, patient, sweet-tempered, low-voiced, obliging, 
truthful and tender, and pretty much all they would need do to their 
children would be to stand aside and see them grow. 

Recipe without Milk. — Take four tablespoonfuls of Ridge's 
Food, mix with a little cold water and a little salt, add one pint hot 
water, boil for two minutes, pour into moulds and place on ice. 
Serve with cream and a little sugar. 

Recipe with Milk. — Take five tablespoonfuls of Ridge's Food; 
first mix the Food with a little cold milk and a little salt, and two 
well-beaten eggs: then add one quart of hot (not boiling) milk, then 
return the whole mixture to the fire and stir briskly till it boils; flavor 
to suit the taste. Pour into moulds. Eat cold with sugar and cream. 

Ridge's Food is carefully put up in four sizes. Sold by druggists 
and grocers at thirty-five cents and upwards, with Woolrich & Co. 
on every label. 

THE WORLD MOVES! 

And as advance is made old things are crowded out by new, because constant ex- 
periment develops better results, as well as cheaper processes of manufacture.

Thousands of persons In every trade, profession, and calling, 
have been cured by 

DR. R. C. FLOWER'S 

Scientific Remedies. 

RIP YAN WINKLE. 

Joseph Jefferson the great actor (whose equal in the character of Rip Tan 
Winkle we shall never see again), states that ho visited Dr Flower in a very low 
state of health. He had given up the stage on account of his health being utterly 
broken down. Dr. Flower entirely cured him, and he is to-day enjoying the very 
best of health, after having filled last season a heavy professional engagement. 
The two great remedies used in this celebrated cure were Dr. Flower's Liver and 
Stomach Sanative and Nerve Pills. 



A RAILROAD PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY. 

Col. Thos. A. Scott, for years President of the great Pennsylvania P. P., said 
just before his sudden death, in answer to a question : " There is but one Dr, 
Flower, and it will be a century before there is another, and the one medioine 
for Liver and Stomach troubles, and the general system, is his Liver and Stom- 
ach Sanative." 

A CASE WITHOUT A PARALLEL. 

In thfit horrible railroad disaster at Ashtabula, Ohio, which every one remem- 
bers, Mrs. F. M. Coulter was hurled through the bridge 70 feet into the river of 
ice Her friend and Messrs. Moody & Sankey's associate, the sweet singer P P. 
Bliss, was killed, and she so badly injured and her nervous system so shocked 
thiit chronic hysteria followed. She was sent to a private asylum, where, after 
a long treatment she was pronounced incurable. Four years ago a friend sent 
her a bottle of Dr. Flower's Nerve Pills. The effect was like magic ; 17 bottles 
were taken, and Mrs. Coulter was thoroughly cured.

RECEIPTS FOR THE SICK ROOM. 

Few people have any idea of the neatness and promptness nec- 
essary In a sick room. All food to be used there should be prepared 
in tile best possible manner, and served as neatly and quietly as good 
nurses know how to do so well, as little things, such as the least 
delay, or any want of proper care in handing food, is quickly noticed 
by ihe invalid. The physician should always be consulted as to the 
kind of food to be given, as what may be beneficial at one time may 
be detrimental at another. 

Dry Toast. — Cut the bread into slices as even as possible, ana 
rather thin; toast until well yellowed. Cover with a napkin, and 
serve quickly while hot. Some people are afraid of dry toast, as it is 
rather binding to the bowels. 

Milk Toast is relished by most convalescents. Cut the broad, 
which should be stale, into thin slices, toast nicely, and lay into a 
deep dish ; pour over it boiling milk. Cover and serve hot. 

Toast Water or Tea. — Pour boiling water upon dry toast, and 
let it stand a few minutes. Then pour the water off the bread, and 
serve hot. It is often much relished.

writes, "Its Effect is Magical." Fifty Cents per Box. Sent free

Soft Toast. — Toast well, but not too brown, two thin slices of 
stale bread; put them on a warm plate, and pour upon ihem some 
boiling water; quickly cover with another dish of the same size, and 
dn.in off the water. Put a very small bit of butter on toast, and 
serve at once while hot. 

Panada. — Take three crackers, split them, one tablespoonful of 
white sugar, a small pinch of salt, a very little nutmeg, and boiling 
water enough to properly cover them. Set on the hearth in a 
covered bowl for about an hour. The crackers should be almost 
clear, and soft as jelly. Put the crackers in the bowl in layers, with 
a grain of salt anil sugar to each layer; serve from the bowl. 

Or, take three arrowroot crackers broken into small pieces, pour 
over them boiling water, and cover close for a minute or two; then 
add a teaspoonfnl of white sugar, and a little new milk. Some use 
more sugar, and lemon juice instead of the milk. 

Arrowroot. — Be careful to get the genuine. Put into a pin^. of 
water grated nutmeg and fine sugar; boil up once, then by degrees 
add a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, previously rubbed smooth with 
two spoonfuls of cold water. 

Arrowroot Gruel. — Take a large spoonful of arrowroot, mix 
with a little cold milk and a little salt, stir it into a pint of boiling 
milk, and boil four minutes. 

CrncKEN Tea. — Take off the skin and all the fat, and boil the 
chicken HI very tender, with just water enough to cover it, adding 
a lit: le salt. Then take the chicken out, and let lh« liquor remain 
until cold; skim off all the fat on top, and serve hot.

Bigelow Carpet Co. 

ORIGINAL POWER-LOOM MANUFACTURERS OF

CARPETS. 



The Carpets made by this Company have received the highest 
award wherever exhibited, including Gold Medals at the Paris Exposi- 
tion, 1878, and at the Centennial, 1876. 

Their deserved reputation for excellence of fabric, richness and 
durability of color, novelty and beauty of design, has led to frequent 
infringements, and inferior goods have often been palmed off in their 
stead. For the protection of the public, the Company has adopted as 
a trade-mark the word " BIGELOW," which will be woven (at every 
repeat of the pattern) in white capitals into the back of the fabric. 

Customers will therefore, have merely to examine the back of a 
Carpet to be certain that they are getting the genuine Bigelow Wiltons, 
or Body Brussels. 



These goods can be obtained from all first-class dealers.
