C. N. CASPAR CO. BOOK EMPORIUM

Publishers' Note. 



"Henriette Davidis' Practical Cook Book" is recog- 
nized in Germany as being the standard authority in 
all matters pertaining to the culinary art. Its popular- 
ity and worth are evidenced by the fact that thirty-five 
editions have already been printed, and the demand for 
the book continues to be as great as. at any time since 
its first appearance, because it is universally acknowl- 
edged as being the best and most practical of all cook 
books which have appeared in that country. 

The original book of Mrs. Davidis has been con- 
stantly revised and kept up to date with each successive 
edition ; in the preface to the German publication Mrs. 
Louise"Holle, who, for a number of years past, has been 
in charge of this important work, says : _ 

"The progress made in science and industrial meth- 
ods during recent years has especially been the means 
of introducing manifold innovations in the culinary 
art, and I have endeavored to place all that has proved 
to be of real practical value in this direction at the dis- 
posal of the users of this Cook Book. ^ 

Furthermore, greater 'demands are to-day made 
upon the cook than formerly. Without any reference 
to luxury a greater variety of dishes is expected, owing 
to a general realization that this is conducive to a 
better nutrition of the body, and that such variety is 
often attainable with the simplest materials. — Food 
preparations for invalids have received proper atten- 
tion, and the receipts in this book for dishes for the sick 
room will prove invaluable. 



It may not be superfluous to say that none of the 
following receipts have been selected without a distinct 
knowledge of their value in each instance, many of 
them being of my own invention, and all having been 
tried in actual kitchen practice." 

Appreciating the fact that we have in America many 
thousands of families comprising not only German- 
Americans, but among them many native Americans 
who are fond of cooking according to the German 
methods, the publishers determined to bring theDavidis 
Cook Book within the reach of those not familiar with 
the German language, and to this end we have made a 
careful compilation and translation of the thirty-fifth 
edition of the book, which we now take pleasure in plac- 
ing upon the market. The German (metrical) weights 
and measures have been changed to conform to those 
in vogue and best understood in this country, and all 
designations of dishes and ingredients have been given 
in every-day English, avoiding the use of French appel- 
lations commonly found in other cook books. In an 
appendix are contained a number of receipts "for the 
preparation of a variety of dishes specifically American 
in their character. Out edition has also been augmented 
by the addition of an 1 English-German vocabulary of 
culinary terms. The typographical arrangement of this 
book conforms in its general character to the one pub- 
lished in Germany. 

We trust that our American "Davidis Cook Book" 
will be found to meet every requirement anticipated in 
a practical, common sense handbook for the kitchen, 
and that it will prove to be as popular and gain as 
many friends as its European predecessor.

Introductory Directions. 



The prop er preparation of our food should never be 
'considered of secondar^Jniportance, even if regartled 
from a purely ttygiemcstand point only. Every young 
girl, no matter what her station in life may be, should 
attain sufficient proficiency in this necessary accom- 
plishment" to enable her either to take charge of her 
kitchen herself, or, where this may not be imperative, to 
exercise that control over her subordinates which is 
always a part of the duties of a thorough housewife, 
and so necessary to keep expenses within bounds and 
to have the table well served. 

The first essential rule to be observed in order to 
achieve the best results in cooking, is s crupulous cle an- 
liness. This consists in having the hands, the kitchen, 
all of the utensils and the table-ware perfectly clean, 
and also in being careful to rinse and freshen your 
vegetables thorough ly. ~ — — *" *~~— «— . — _ 

The second rule is : Economy. An extravagant use 
of sugar, butter, and spices does not make your dishes 
any more palatable, but on the contrary, it detracts 
from their perfection, is unwholesome, and often spoils 
much that would otherwise be excellent food. Economy 
consists further in utilizing all odds and ends which can 
be used for our nutrition, and finally in a practical 
disposal of remnants of dishes which have once appeared 
on the table and oftentimes make a pleasing addition 
to our bill of fare, when skillfully prepared in another 
form. 



Introductory Directions. xlv 

The third rule is : Care and deliberation. All cook- 
ing should be put on fh^^oveattHe pfopermoment— 
neither too early nor too late. The size of the kettles 
or other utensils should always be adapted to the quan- 
tity of whatever is to be cooked; this is particularly 
essential in cooking meats. — The fire must be carefully 
attended to, so that the cooking will proceed uniformly 
and the food neither be scorched nor served half-done. 

The fourth rule is, to have all ingredient s and 
materials necessary for the preparation of your dishes 
ready and handy before you commence cooking, s o that 
"nothing need be hurriedly done and you have abundant 
time to cook everything properly and can send it to the 
table nicely and orderly. Many excellent dishes are 
spoiled when improperly served. Plenty of hot water 
should always be ready while you are cooking in case 
any is needed for replenishing purposes ; it is also better 
to w arm platters, plates, etc., in hot water than to CIO" 
this on the stove or in the oven? because they are not 
so liable to discolor or crackle. 



In the following receipts the various quantities of 
each ingredient to be used have been given as accurately 
as possible, but the proportion of salt for each dish 
could not, in all cases, be definitely indicated ; it would" 
also be impossible to have scales and measures always 
at haud in order to minutely determine how much of 
this or the other article should be taken. Practice will 
soon enable the painstaking cook to judge correctly in 
regard to these particular matters of detail. Spices 
should, generally speaking, be used in accordance with 
the taste of those who are _to partake of the dishes, but, 
on the whole, the directions given in the receipts should 
be adhered to. Pepper should always be added with 
caution, because its overabundant use is deleterious t o 
health , especially for children. For the same reason, 
nu tmegs a n d cloves sh ould be used— ag_ spar ingly "as 
pogsTBte! Kvery dTsBT should of courseD§"'pToperly 
spiced, but too much spicing must always be avoided. 



xlvi, Introductory Directions. 

Supplies for the kitchen should always be purchased 
at the most seasonable times, because then they cau be 
obtained at the most advantageous prices. Always 
buy the best meats, poultry, vegetables, butter, flour, 
etc., because, while the best may cost a trifle more, yet 
it will be found in the end that, as in everything else, 
the best is here the cheapest also, and, beyond this, the 
most wholesome. 

Flour, must alway be stored in a dry, but airy place; 
w hen flour becomes damp, it sho uld be tur ned and sifted. 
frjgqa ififfiHyT "" Good wheaQ i'our is almost pure white in 
color, with a very aPglTfyeTiowiBh tinge : it possesses an 
agreeable sweetish taste, and whsa3c6SSUlg.Jfc m the 
hand it ballsv eryl^oseTyT Poc>r -nou ji'ia-gra v or reddish 
in hue anaroHelfa^rTil^pecliled, has a sour or musty 
odor, and when moistened feelsclammv in the han d. — 
All kinds of starch flours^sucn as potato, wheat, and 
cornstarch flour, mustjbe pure white in color and very 
smooth. — Caroli na rice. is the best; it must be clear 
white, hard , transparent, and the grains long, sle nder, 
and sharp-edged. *" ■——""" 

Pearl sago isjsuperior to all others ; inf erior sag Q_ 
dissolves in cooking into a pasty m ass. — Bufteris most 
frequently used where fats are "to Fe "added to dishes ; it 
possesses somewhat less nutritive qualities than other 
animal fats, but is more readily digested. Kidney suet 
(see A, 17,) is indispensable in cooking many fine dishes^ 
because when used with meats which must remain in 
the oven a long time it does not brown so easily as 
butter; goose-grease and lard (see A, 16 and 18) are 
also of great value. Fats already used for roasts should 
not be preserved for any lengthof time, and in no case 
should they again be used for that purpose. — As a sub- 
stitute for pure Olive oil, cotton-seed oil need not be 
despised — indeed the latter is more frequently sold as 
"Olive oil" than under its proper«designation. Genuine 
Olive oil is quite expensive. All oils, used in coo king 
must be odorless or but sli ghtly aromati c when frtiorJeB 
betsKeenthe hands ; a rancid condition of the oil is more 



readily d jgc^rmblePv; f ML me^an s thajkby the to ngue. 
It is almost superfluous io say thafeggs shoulanev 



eggs should never

be .stale, but that the freshest obtainable must invari- 
ably be used. 



* * 



Eegarding the best cuts of meats and the proper 
handling thereof, explanations will be found in Division 
D, I, VI and VII, and Division F.— Concerning vegetables 
but little need be said, inasmuch as they can usually be 
obtained of good quality and in prime condition. 



The quantity of meat, etc., necessary to prepare a 
meal will depend of course, upon the. number of persons 
expected at the table.— For a large dinner pa rty tak e% 
pound of beef for e ach person ior a good soup or bou- 
illon ; veaTlT po und . For a smaller din ner party take 
onaJ ialf m ore. " Usui g but halFoTthe quantity of meat 
'and adding to each quart of soup y 6 to % ounce of 
extract of beef and the same amount of salt, will make 
_a plentifully strong bouillon at less expense. 

One chicken will make enough soup for 4 — 5 persons. 

Codfish— 1% pounds for 4 — 5 persons, if served with 
potatoes without any other meat-dish. 

• Rice boiled with milk, 3 ounces for each person. 
/ Roast s, no matter whether beef, veal, mutton or 
lamb, should be reckoned at 1 pound (including the 
bones) for each person . As it wouicrnot look well to 
cut up the last shred, it will be impracticable to take 
less, even when there are a number of other dishes, 
unless the roast consists of a large cut without bone. 

A good sized turkey, filled, will be sufficient for 
10 — 12 persons, and when another roast is served with 
it, it will be enough for 18 persons. 

Spring chickens, when quite small, one for each per- 
son ; when of medium size four will be sufficient for 6 
Eersons. If an additional roast is served, one-fourth 
ss of the chickens will answer. 

Pigeons — Six to eight for 4 persons; with a var- 
iety of dishes on the table a few less pigeons can be 
prepared. 



XLvra Introductory Directions. 

One goose is enough for 8 to 10 persons, and one 
duck for 3 to 4 persons. 

A' shoulder of venison will be enough for 10 to 12 
persons, and with an additional roast will suffice for 
18 to 20 persons. 

A leg of venison alone is enough for 8 to 10 persons, 
with another roast for 15 persons. 



A. — Miscellaneous Receipts. 

1. To clarify Sugar. Dip the sugar in cold water, 
put it in a medium sized kettle (preferably of brass or 
nickel), allowing it to d issolve over a slow fi re, skim- 
ming off the broth until it is clear. In order to clarify 

.it particularly quick and clear, add the be aten whit e of 
anegg^which will absorb the froth. """" """** — 

2. Frosting. To obtain very white frosting, which 
is essential for most puddings and cakes, the freshest 
whites of eggs are necessary. Beat in a large platter, in 
a cool place, until it is thick and stiff enough to turn, 
which will usually take from 5—10 minutes. A few 
dro ps of lemon juice a dded to the whites of the egg s will 
aid materially to st iffen the frosting, 'rne frosting 
should be used immediately when done7"otherwise it is 
apt to turn watery. 

^— 'Jf the frosting is to be made into little balls for milk 
or beer soups, or is to be used for ices or cakes, a small 
jgyuantity of pulverized sugar should be beaten with it. 

3. Flour rubbed in Butter. Cook a, piece of butter 
in an iron kettle, add a tablespoonful of flour and stir 
until it commences to curl and bubble. It must be well 
done, but onl y lightly yellowu utsolor ; if water, bouillon, 
or other liquid issHrredf'iip with it, these sho"uld be cold, 
because then, it will remain nice and smootTT If the 
floured butter is to be used in meat soups, stews, ra- 
gouts, etc., it can be added to the dish while cooking, 
after the latter has been skimmed, because it dissolves 
completely when cooked for any length of time. 

4. Browned Flour. Stir a good sized piece of but- 
ter in a kettle until it commences to brown, add flour, 
stirring constantly until it is nicely browned, being 



2 A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 

careful Hot to scorch. Flour can be browned without 
butter, and preserved for future use. Put it into a 
small kettle and place over a slow fire, and stir con- 
stantly until lightily browned. A better process is to 
put the flour into a baking pan, and to brown i n the 
oven. — — — — * — > — 

5". Cleaning and scalding Rice. Rice should be 
carefully picked over, rubbed between the hands in 
water, and then put on the fire in cold water, and, be- 
fore it commences to boil pour it into a sieve. This pro- 
cess is particularly essential if the rice is to be used in 
the sickroom, or for milk-dishes, because the acids 
sometimes contained in the rice, causing the milk to 
curdle, are thereby removed. 

6. To prepare Sago. Sago should also be carefully 
picked over, washed, placed on the fire in cold water, 
and after warming up, poured into a sieve. After 
repeating this once it is ready for use. 

7. Browned Butter. Put the butter into an iron 
kettle on a slow fire and stir until brown; it dissolves 
at first, and then slowly commences to brown. 

Whatever is intended to be browned, must be put 
into the butter after the latter is browned, otherwise 
the color will not be nice. Care must be taken, how- 
ever, to prevent even the slightest scorching. 

8. Clarified or Melted Butter, designed principally 
for Crullers, Doughnuts, Fritters, etc. Butter for this 
purpose must be clarified ; if not, it will bubble and run 
over when the crullers, etc., are put into it. Put it into 
a medium sized iron kettle over a slow fire until it is 
light and clear, which will take about two hours. The 
froth not dipped from the top, partly settles at the 
bottom. As soon as the cooking sound is no longer 
heard, the butter is heated to the required degree; re- 
move it from the fire, let it stand about ten minutes, 
take off the remaining froth and pour the clear butter 
into a perfectly clean stone jar, taking care to prevent 
any of the sediment being poured with it. After it is 
cool cover it with paper, put on this a layer of salt 
about one-half inch deep, and set it aside, uncovered, in 
a cool, airy place. 



A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 3 

Butter clarified, in the above manner is the very best 
for doughnuts and crullers, and for general cooking 
purposes it is unexcelled. 

9. Crab Butter. Take about 20 crabs and stir them 
in clear water with a small whisk until they are perfectly 
clean, put on the fire and cook for 5 minutes. Pick the 
meat from the shells, put all the shells with about 6 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a mortar and pound, but 
not too fine ; put on the fire, stirring occasionally until 
the mass turns tb a red color and commences to raise, 
then add one quart of water, boil and strain into a deep 
dish through a fine sieve; after cooling, the red butter 
is ready for use; the remaining liquor can be used for 
soups, particularly so if the crabs are boiled in beef 
broth, or extract of beef has been added to the water. 

The tails of the crabs can be utilized in the soup or 
in a stew. 

10. Anchovy Butter. Stir 1 pound of good butter 
to a froth, freshen 1 pound oJL &nchovies (see No. 31), 
let them remain i n fresh w1tt er""I0— 15 minutes, to 
sweeten ; chop thein iupTine7pr§ss the mass through a 
sieve, put into a small stone jar, cover, and keep in a 
cool place. 

Anchovy Butter is spread on toasted wheat bread, 
and used in g ravies, stews, e tc. When put to the latter 
use it should^Be added jus t before serving , because it 
mustnot^Qk, 

11. Parsley Butter. Bring a quantity of clarified 
butter to a boil, stir into it a good proportion of pars- 
ley and set aside for winter use. 

12. Epicurean Butter. This is used to spread on 
toast. ,4 boned anchovies, 4 small pickles, a trifle of 
chives and tarragon should be chopped very fine, pass 
the yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs through a sieve, mix 
with 4 tablespoonfuls of butter, 1 teaspoonful of must 
ard, and then put the entire mass through a sieve. 

13. Fairy Butter. An English receipt. The yolks 
of 3 hard-boiled eggs, 2 spoonfuls of sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of oraugeflower water a nd 4 tablespoonfuls of 
finest un salte d butter, well mixed and passed thrdugh a 



4 A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 

sieve. This butter ie used to spread on cakes. Instead 
of the sugar and orangeflower water % pound of crushed 
hazelnuts or grated almonds can be used, with the addi- 
tion of a small quantity of lemon juice. 

14. Fried Bread for Soups and Dumplings. (Crou- 
tons.) Put the butter on the fire, cut the bread into 
small pieces, or small figures if preferred, stir in the but- 
ter until it becomes yellow. Do not allow it to become 
hard. 

15. Eggs in Soups, Gravies and Stews. Eggs are 
not added to dishes of this kind until they are cooked 
and taken from the fire. It is done in the following 
•manner : The yolks, which must be fresh, are first stirred 
with a little cold water, then add some of the boiling 
soup or gravy, increasing gradually and continuing the 
stirring, then pour into thehot dish, constantly stirring, 
which will prevent the eggs from curdling. Whole eggs 
— the yolks and whites together — can be whipped up 
with a small quantity of water and some of the hot 
soup added, keeping up a continual stirring. A whole 
egg is equal to two yolks of eggs for the above purpose 
and more nutritious, but does not taste quite as well as 
the' clear yolks of eggs, and should, therefore, not be 
used for fine dishes. 

16. An excellent Goose Oil, which will remain 
sweet for a long time. The fat is first set aside for a 
day in a cool place in water and ' the latter changed 
three or four times. Then cut up the fat, add a small 
quantity of salt, put on the fire and slowly try it out, 
being careful to stir frequently. When the oil is quite 
clear and the remaining pieces of a light yellow color, 
the former is poured through a strainer into a stone jar 
and set aside for about a week. Then take the oil out 
Of the jar, leaving the sediment and jelly. Put the oil on 
the fire again, adding a few sour apples pared and 
quartered, cook until the apples are soft and commence 
to roast, then again pour the oil through a fine strainer 
into the jar and the next day cover with paper perfor- 
ated with, a needle. If it is desired that the oil be of a 
firmer consistency, add a small "quantity of tried leaf 
lard. 



A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 5 

17. An excellent Way to prepare Kidney Suet. The 

firmer the suet, the better and richer it is. Cut it up 
into medium sized pieces, put it into fresh water, and 
let it stand until the next day, changing the water once 
during that time. Then chop the suet up fine, and, take 
a small quantity of milk — about a small cupful to a 
pound of suet — cook it in an openkettle over a slowfire, 
straining frequently until the suet appears perfectly 
clear ; it then does not need straining, but can at once 
be filled into a stone jar. The suet may also be cut into 
small cubes, then, after being tried out, it can be passed' 
through a sieve; this method is preferable where the 
suet is to be used for fine dishes. If milk is added while 
trying the suet, it must not be stirred, and the kettle 
must not be placed directly on the fire. Should the suet 
be scorched it will be worthless, because it will thereby 
acquire a bitter taste. The cracklings, which at first 
should be loosened from the bottom of the kettle with 
an iron spoon, must not have a deeper color than light 
brown, and the clear suet, which has a sweet odor, like 
butter, is passed through a strainer. The cracklings 
when chopped with boiled beef, make excellent meat 
balls. 

18. To Try Fat. Although it may seem that an y 
directions how to try fat are unnecessary here, yet the 
fact is, it is too often very carelessly done. 

The thick and firm pieces are the best for the pur- 
pose. Cut the fat into small cubes, as nearly alike in 
size as possible. Put them into an iron kettle or similar 
utensil, set over a medium fire, stir frequently until the 
pieces are yellow and crisp. This will prevent the fat 
from evaporating or receiving a scorchy taste, which is 
unavoidable if you have a very hot fire. Ham fat is 
well adapted for trying out in this manner, but the 
smoked outer crust must be carefully cut away. 

19. Clear Broth for White Stew. To make a stew 
for 12 persons take 3 pounds of lean beef cut into small 
pieces, jcover with water and put on the fire, skim 
carefully and add at once % of a celery root, 1 carrot, 
1 parsley root, 2 onions, all cut into pieces, no salt, 
cover and cook for 2 hours. Pour through a sieve, set 
aside, and when it is to be used for the stew, take off 
the fat and pour carefully from the settlings. 



6 A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 

20. Brown Broth for Brown Ragout. For 12 per- 
sons take % pound of pork fat cut into slices, put it into 
an enameled kettle, add to this M pound of raw ham 
(remnants of ham can also be used) and 2 pounds of 
beef, both cut into slices, also 2 onions, 2 bay leaves, 1 
carrot, % of a celery root, 1 parsley root and whole 
spices. If you have any remnants of various kinds of 
raw meats they can be substituted for the beef. Put on 
a slow fire, cover and let it simmer for % hour. It will 
be of advantage if it turns brown without scorching. 
Then add a dash of boiling water and repeat this sev- 
eral- times if the meat should adhere to the kettle. 
When brown enough, add sufficient boiling water to 
make the required amount of ragout. Salt is not used 
but is put into the finished ragout If th^ meats are well 
cooked after the elapse of 1 or 2 hours, the broth is 
passed through a sieve and the fat and settlings re- 
moved. Instead of the beef, 2 teaspoonfuls of extract 
of beef can be used. 

y^ 21. To give Brown Soups, Ragouts and Sauces a 
good Color. Put 1 tablespoonf ul of sugar into a sauce- 
pan over the fire, and stir constantly until it has turned 
to a dark brown color. Immediately add 1 small cupful 
of water, take from the stove, stir, set it aside for color- 
ing purposes in a closed glass receptacle. 1 teaspoonful 
is sufficient to give a large cupful of broth a nice yellow 
color. 

An onion nicely browned in ashes, peeled, and then 
boiled with the soup after the latter has been skimmed, 
will give it a nice color. 

22. Liver Force Meats. To % pound of tender 
veal, cut into cubes, add a few tablespoonfuls of finely 
chopped mushrooms, some parsley, half of a bay leaf, 
some salt, a little pepper and nutmeg, and 2 heaping 
tablespoonfuls of butter; let it cook slowly about 20 
minutes. Take the livers of 10 or 12 fowls stiffened in 
beef broth or weak brine, put together in a mortar and 
pound until fine. 

Instead of mushrooms, truffles rubbed in butter 
can be used ; the j jyer of a goose or galf can be substi- 
tuted for fowl liverTlinchnnely chopped arichoviesTfo" 
suit the taste, may be added. If goose liver is taken 



A. — MISCELLANEOUS KECEIPTS. 7 

it can be used for making' goose liver patties, or for 
goose dressing. 

23. Beef Force Meat. % pound of lean beef and a 
little over 2 ounces of pork fat or kidney suet chopped 
fine, add salt, lemon peel, mace, a small piece of melted, 
yellow-browned butter, a trifle over 2 ounces of wheat 
bread soaked in cold water and then pressed, and 2 
eggs, the white beaten to a broth. Stir well together, 
and it will make good force meat. 

24. Veal Force Meat for Soup Dumplings. % pound 
of veal chopped with 1 ounce of marrow fat or kidney 
suet, 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, salt, 2 ounces 
of wheat bread without any crust, which have been 
soaked in cold water and well pressed, and 2 eggs, the 
whites of which have been beaten. Stir well together. 

25. Poultry Force Meat. After removing the skin 
from the breast of any kind of a fowl, it (the breast) 
should be pounded fine and passed through a sieve. 
Add 4 tablespoonfuls of unsalted butter to 1 pound of 
pounded meat and stir to a froth. Add the yolks of 
4 eggs, nutmeg, a tablespoonful of chopped anchovies, 
3 ounces of soaked wheat bread, which have been made 
into a paste on the fire, and salt; mixwell togetherwith 
the sifted meat. Instead of the creamery butter, crab 
butter (see No. 9), can be used, and the sifted meat need 
also be mixed only with the white of 1 egg and 1 large 
cupful of sweet cream, and all other ingredients be 
omitted. When prepared in this manner it makes good 
force meat for meat pies. 

26. Fish Force Meat. Take 1 pound of fish (the 
best are pickerel or carp), cleaned and boned, % pound 
of fresh pork fat, 2 stirred eggs, 1 small onion baked 
in butter, 1 anchovy, some finely chopped parsley, salt, 
ground white pepper and mace. After chopping this 
all up very finely, soak about 2 ounces of stale wheat 
bread in cold water, press it out well, stir into a dough 
on the fire with about 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of butter, 
then mix well with 1 or 2 raw eggs. 

27. Force Meat Dressing for about 12 Pigeons or a 
Breast of Veal. Stir about 2 heaping taiblespoonfuls of

butter until soft, add the yolks of 3 eggs, some mace or 
lemon peel, salt, about 8 ounces of grated wheat bread, 1\ 
large cupful of milk or cream, and the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a froth. One-third of this quantity mixed 
with some finely chopped parsley, is sufficient dressing 
for four pigeons. If desired, the finely chopped heart 
and liver of the pigeons may be added; in this case, 
however, more milk or cream will be needed. 

28. Raisin Force Meat. Stir about 2 heaping table- 
spoonfuls of butter until soft and add the yolks of 
3 eggs, some mace or grated lemon peel, about % pound 
of stale grated wheat bread, 3 tablespoonfuls of either 
sour or sweet cream, salt, ]i pound of small raisins, 
about 2 teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar mixed with 
cinnamon. This is sufficient dressing for a turkey, 8 
pigeons or 6 spring chickens. 

29. Almond Force Meat. Take a coffeecupful of 
almonds and cover them with boiling water; as soon 
as the skins can be easily removed, take them out of 
the water, skin them, put in a mortar (a small quantity 
at a time k_add a trifle of water and pound until very 
fine. Mix the p^ouudedalmon"ds"with 3 tablespoonfuls 
of butter stirred until soft, the yolks of 3 eggs, mace 
and 2 coffeecupfuls of grated stale wheat bread. After 
stirring this all well together with a quantity of good 
cream, mix with the beaten whites of 2 eggs. This is 
sufficient dressing for a duck or 2 pigeons. 

30. Cream of Anchovy for Meat Patties or Toast. 

Fresh butter and some flour lightly browned together, 
add sweet cream, finely chopped onions and lemon juice ; 
cook thoroughly. Into this stir some finely chopped 
anchovies and the yolks of a few eggs, and then cook 
again. 

31. How Anchovies should be prepared. Rinse the 
anchovies in water two or three times to clear them of 
salt, then let ihem stand in fresh water 10 — 15 minutes 
longer. Anchovies of an inferior quality must remain 
in the water a longer time, perhaps several hours. If 
good anchovies are laid in milk and the latter is fre- 
quently changed, they acquire a most delicious taste. 



A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 9 

After the anchovies have been watered, pick off the 
fins from the back with the fingers, take them by the 
tail and pull them into halves, removing the spine a nd 
the rear fin. Then put the anchovies into a strainer 
and drain. "They can be served with a dressing of olive 
oil and wine vinegar, or finely chopped onions, vinegar, 
olive oil and pepper. The best method of serving ancho- 
vies is to put them on a small platter in the form of a 
star, filling the spaces with capers, small onions, finely 
chopped herbs, and the grated yolks of eggs. The flesh 
of poor! anchovies is white and liffht: those of i nferior 
quality are hard and dry and of a yellow ish red color? 



32. To prepare Celery and Parsnips for Soups, etc. 
Celery roots must be washed, peeled and cut into 4 — 8 
pieces, the young unopened leaves need not be removed- 
Parsley roots must be washed, scraped and cut into 
pieces about 2 inches long, and split if very thick. Both 
are used for beef soups, the latter for chicken and veal 
soups only. 

Parsley* heads must be rinsed, the large heads cut 
away, take them in a bunch and cut them on a chop- 
ping board as finely as possible with a sharp knife. A 
little practice will enable one to cut parsley as fine in 
this way, as though it were chopped . 

33. Truffles. Truffles must also be soaked from 
1 — 1% hours, they are then thoroughly cleaned, prefer- 
ably with a brush, then cooked in a rich beef broth or 
claret ; cut into pieces and serve in- gravies. 

34. Mushrooms. Remove thp nnt OT- flltj" from the 
upper part of the stalk of the mushroom, cutting away 
the small leaves clustering under the head. Then wash 
in cold water, cut them up, put them in butter and on 
the fire, cook them rapidly in their own liquor and put 
them into~thelitew as they come from the kettle. They 
b ecome hard if cooked too lonff. 

Dried mushrooms must be s oaked in water a bout

when it is ready to serve. 



10 A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 

35. To prepare Veal Sweetbreads for Stews and 
Gravies. Put the sweetbreads on the fire in cold water ; 
as soon as hot pour off the water and renew, repeating 
several times until the sweetbreads are white. Then 
put them in cold water, take the skin from the 
longer pieces and cut off the fleshy parts from the 
others, cut the sweetbreads into cubes, and then cook 
in the stew for about 10 minutes. 

36. Pistachios. Put them on the fire in cold water, 
let them come to aboil, hull them, lay them into cold 
water and leave until wanted for use. When used in 
stews they must cook not less than 30 minutes. 

37. Crabs with Dressing. (Devilled Crabs.) Before 
cooking the crabs, stir th em in c lear water w ith a small 
whisk u ntil they are perfectly cleanT ^' rut them into 
boiling water with vin^ar ' and'aaffi and cook until they 
afe done. 'Break ofe ' ■Ji'ne iGai'fs'i"'picfi; out the shells, and 
then fill with force meats (see No. 23 or 27). The crab 
shells filled with dressing are then cooked or baked in 
the stew few about 15 minutes, and, with the tails, 
added to the stew when the latter is served. 

38. To scald Onions. Peel the onions, then pour 
boiling water over them and after standing for about 
8—10 minutes, dip in cold water and dry, with a cloth. 
Scalded onions should always be used in cooking, be- 
cause scalding them removes everything that is usually 
considered unpleasant in taste >abou,t this vegetable, 
and makes it very palatable. 

39. Chestnuts prepared for various cooking pur- 
poses. If chestnuts are to be used in a stew or as a 
dressing for poultry, put the kernels into boiling water • 
long enough to permit the removal of the hulls the 
same as with almonds, and then rinse them in cold 
water. Put them into an enameled kettle, with the 
addition of some water, butter and a small piece of 
sugar. Cover tightly and simmer ^lowly until done. 
In this way the chestnuts will be white, tender and not, 
crumby. 

Chestnuts as an addition to cabbage are prepared 
in the same manner. They can be either stirred into 
the cabbage before the latter is served, or be brought 
to the table in a separate dish. 



A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 11 

Chestnuts for dessert or tea with bread and butter 
have their shells split and are either roasted in a coffee 
roaster or an iron kettle— adding a small handful of 
salt to a pound of chestnuts — and are ro asted until soft 
and tender, wmch will take from %=-% qfan hour ; be 
careful to stir or shake them frequently. 

Before serving the chestnuts rub them in a coarse 
cloth; they should be quite hot when put on the table. 

40. Spice Extract for S.tews. Cover the kernels of 
60 sound walnuts with hot water for a few minutes, rub 
with a cloth to hull them, and when they are dry put 
them in layers into a stone jar with the following spices 
which have first been well ground together : % ounce of 
mace, some cloves (or, if preferred, garlic), ginger, 1 
ounce of mustard seed, a pinch of whole white pepper, a 
piece of grated horse-radish, a handful of salt, 6 or 8 
bay leaves, then add 1 quart of good wine vinegar well 
boiled. After the mixture has cooled, cover the jar, set 
it outside in the air, and after 2 or' 3 weeks the extract 
can be filled into bottles which must be well corked. 

The spices retain strength enough for anotherfilling 
of boiled vinegar which has been cooled . 2 teaspoonfuls 
of this extract are sufficient for a stew for 6 persons. 

41. Dill in Vinegar for pickling purposes. Dill is 
a favorite aromatic plant and is much used with pickles 
in vinegar. Dill is at its best im me diately after the 
blossoming timeV 'bllL very often when wanted for use, it 
is no longer green ; for this reason it would be well to 
jmt the dill wh en the heads are stillfresh andgreen, and 
^preserve tn'ern in a lar ge glass jar r c*overed*' with vinegar, 
until they are wanted for use.,. 

42. Pepper, Nutmeg, Cloves and Mace should be 
ground when needed and not before, because they other- 
wise lose a large percentage of their aromatic strength 
and flavor. 

43. Mustard. As a usual thing, prepared mustards 
are of a very inferior quality, and it is advisable, there- 
fore, to prepare them Onesself. Take blac k a n d yellow, 
mustard flour in equal parts, and to each % pounaadd 
I' heaping 1 teaspoonf ul of white sugar, a pinch of ground 
cloves, % teaspoonful of alfepice, and enough white wine 
vinegar and white wine in equal parts to make a moder- 



12 A.— Miscellaneous Receipts. 

ately stiff paste. When done fill into small wide-mouthed 
bottles, cork and let stand one week before using. 

44. Almond Paste. Shell the nuts, pour boiling 
water over them and let them ;stand a few minutes. 
Then remove the skins, which will slip off easily, pound 
the almonds to the finest paste, moistening them occa- 
sionally with either water, the whites of eggs or arrac, 
as the receipt may require. Pounded dry makes ;the 
almonds oily. A stone or porcelain mortar is the best. 

45. To wash Currants. After picking the currants 
over, put them into a sieve, place this in a deep pan 
containing lukewarm water, and rub hard between the 
hands. This loosens the small stems which will sink 
into the water; the latter must be renewed several 
times. Befor£L _Buiiting them i nto cakes, currants and 
raisins must be dri ef 

46. To clean an bTsTone Raisins. Remove the stems, 
pick them over carefully, rinse in lukewarm water, then 
dry and stone them. Large raisins may be cut into 
pieces before using. 

47. Points about Lemons and how to keep them. 
There being so many lemons with a bitter taste put on 
the market, it is better to test them before use, which is 
particularly necessary when lemons are to beputinto 
jellies, creams, blanc manges, or used for soups and 
beverages. Do not neglect to wash and dry the lem ons 
before using them, and to relnjQ^e ljEnle"'seedg ~a^d the 
white inner skiTi_w hicTi also inipartsa bittertaste. 

To keep lemons, they should be wrapped- in tiss ue 
paper and laid in acoolpjace where there isa^ raftl— ^ 
"TTo keep Tern on*peeT1resE, grate it on sugaYjT^akeoff 
the yellow sugar very carefully, and preserve this lemon 
sugar in a widemouthed bottle well corked. As a sub- 
stitute for the pure lemon juice, the extract of lemon 
can be used, which usually gives satisfaction. 

48. The Use and Preservation of Orange Peel. 

Orange peel can in many cases be substituted for lemon 
peel; it gives a very nice'flavor to most sauces. In 
prder to keep well for a long time, peel the orange 
fchinty with a sharp knife, chop the peel very fine, mix 
with 2 tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar, keep in a 
well-corked bottle. 



B. — Soups. 



I. MEAT SOUPS. 

1. General Directions for cooking Soup Stock. The 

kettle in which the soup is cooked should be used for 
this purpose exclusively and be kept perfectly clean. 
The best are made of heavy tiu or enameled ware, and 
have a tightly fitting cover. 

Dried peas, etc., can be softened by adding % to 1 
teaspoonf ul ot b icarboimte-of and a, ( or saleratus) while 
they are cooking; it may be well to state, however, 
that this does not, improve their flavo r The meat for 
soup "slUUk lh list be fresh. The shinbone is generally 
used, but the joint and the neck or "sticking-piece," as 
the butchers call it, contains more of the substance that 
you wish to extract, and makes a stronger and more 
nutritious soup than any other part of the animal. 
However, nearly every kind of meat, such as mutton, 
veal, game or poultry, will make good soups of varying 
excellence. 

For invalids who may partake of easily digestible 
food only, soups made from poultry or veal are the 
best. The meat from young animals will not make so 
strong a soup as that from older. 

Where a strong soup is wanted without reference to 
the juiciness of the meat, as in case of a dinner party 
where the soup-meat is not brought to the table, take 
a piece of the joint without bone or fats, and although 
this may, apparently, after having been used for the 
soup, beoi little account, yet when chopped up with fat 
boiled ham or nice pork fat, it will make very palatable 
meat balls. If the meat is to be served after the soup, 



14 B.— Soups. 

however, or as a side-dish, it will be well to cut away all 
'ragged pieces and then cut it up into smaller pieces, 
place it, covered with cold water, on the back of the 
stove for about 1 hour, bring to a boil and then add 
it to the soup when the latter begins to boil; whatever 
a soup made in this manner lacks in strength, may be 
supplied by the addition of some extract of beef. 
N* Meats for soups should be washed very slightly and 
must not be laid in water, as this would tend to lessen 
their strength. Whenever possible, do not wash the - 
meat at all, in any event it must ndc De Kept in the" 
^vater too lotig. When the meat is put on the fire, good 
judgment should be exercised as'to the amount which 
will boil away and the quantity of water first put into 
the kettle gauged accordingly; adding water after the 
soup is done is very detrimental. Should it have boiled 
away ±o a much, however, then a little hot water may 
be added! Soups cooked over a charcoal or peat fire, 
are the best. Inasmuch as soups req uire long cooking 
and lose in quantity even in 'aVfcightly coveT : eia !; 1?eTflt?7" 
is easy to o yersalt, and this circumstance must be taken 
intxTSoffisiaeration when the" salt is first put in. It is 
always easy to add more salt if needed, but over-salting 
is an indication of either negligence or ignorance. 

If a good, clear, palatable soup is wanted, a thor- 
ough skimming must not be neglected. At present" 
many Recommend that soup snduld riot be skimmed, 
claiming that skimming weakens the soup. We cannot 
agree with this view, the albumen contained in the 
scum has but little nutritive value and a cloudy soup is 
not nearly so palatable (which should be the principal 
feature of a good soup) as one that is quite clear. But 
the skimming should natUa&djQt ie top soon— not before 
the meat has slowly simmerecTTtbr at' least % hour/] 
Throw in a tablespoonful of cold wa ter, which will

lateT^Ea^Foffr" ** '" ~ 

Be careful in cooking the soup to keep the kettle 
closely covered, in order not to lose the flavor of the 
juices, and keep it simmering slowly, but without ceas- 
ing, until done, being careful to prevent boiling over. 
After cooking about 1 hour, take the precaution to 
pass the soup through a sieve, slightly rinse the meat 



Meat Soups. 15 

to take off any scum which may adhere to it, and then 
place all back into the kettle (which has been cleaned in 
the meantime) and put on the fire again, having added 
the desired vegetables, etc. 

Vegetables in Soups. A piece of celery root cooked 
in the soup gives it a pleasant flavor. If one wishes to 
add the celery plentifully, it is well to first coOk it in 
water before adding it to the soup, so that the flavor of 
the celery will not be stronger than the flavor of the 
meat; for the same reason too large a quantity of 
vegetables, particularly celery tops, should never be 
put into the soup; in a weak beef broth, pea soup or 
potato soup vegetables, however, may be added to 
advantage. A red onion will give the soup a yellowish 
color, and is an agreeable seasoning. 

Parsley and salsify s hould be added a bout an hour 
after 'tne soup ha s cleared. Parsley, leek and asparaT 
gus will becom^tOTder in about % hour, celery root in 
a short hour. The preparation of soup vegetables is 
explained under No. 32, A. 

To thicken Soups. If flour is to be used for thicken- 
ing meat- or potato soup, it should be browned to a 
light yellow color with a piece of butter in a kettle or 
pan over a slow fire. Instead of this, however, flour 
may be kneaded with some fresh butter, make a small 
dumpling and put it into the soup at once after the 
latter has been passed through a sieve. The dumpling 
will dissolve completely and thicken the soup' nicely. 
But the browned flour is preferable because it adds 
more strength to the soup. 

" When flour is used to thicken soups, it should never 
be put in raw, because this will impart an unpleasant 
flavor which will spoil even an ordinary potato soup. 
-Soups cooked for large dinner parties at which there 
are several courses, are usually served quite clear and 
without the addition of the usual soup vegetables. 
Small dumplings with a little fresh asparagus or cauli- 
flower may be added. For the family table, soups can 
be thickened with slightly browned flour, as above, and 
the addition of rice, pearl barley, noodles, or sago will 
make them more nutritious. Sago, noodles or vermicelli 
are u sually added to strong beef stock. 



16 B.— Soups. 

Quantities and Length of Time for cooking Pearl 
Barley, Rice, Sago and Fancy Noodles. 2 heaping table- 
spoonfuls of pearl barley or rice are sufficient in soup 
enough for 4 persons ; 1 heaping tablespoonf ul of sago 
or fancy noodles in clear bouillon. Pearl barley and pure 
sago should be cooked in the soup 2% — 3 hours, rice 
1 — 1% hours, potato sag o (which can be di stinguishe d 
by its s mall rou na gr ains) % — 1 hour, fancy noodles and

ing them is veryjiarmfulj 



Dumplings. When dumplings are wanted in the 
broth or soup,- take out the meat, lay it on a dish 
placed over boiling water, add 2 — 3 tablespoonf uls of 
soup fat and cover the dish at least until the soup is 
served. If the soup is to be entirely clear, it is better 
to cook the dumplings in slightly salted water to which 
a trifle of extract of beef has been added, and then take 
them out with a skimmer and put them into a tureen ; 
the remaining broth, after having been put through a 
sieve, can be used for other soups or for cooking vege- 
tables. 

To make Soup stronger. A weak meat soup can be 
made stronger and more palatable by the addition of 
good extract of beef, of which small quantities are 
needed, perhaps as much at a time as can be taken on 
the point of a table knife; further on, directions will 
be given how good, strong soups can be made without 
any meat by simply using beef extracts. 

All meat soups must be served as hot as possible.. 

2. Quick Beef Broth. Into a large cup put the 
yolk of a fresh egg, some salt, a very fimall quantity of 
mace or nutmeg, a piece of butter the size of half a 
hazelnut (the butter is not absolutely necessary) and 
% teaspoonful of extract of beef ; stir well and gradually 
fill the. cup with % pint of fresh boiling water. Instead 
of the butter a piece of beef marrow the size of half a 
hazelnut is much better; chop fine, cook for about 10 
minutes in the boiling water which is to be used for the

broth, and then pass through a sieve onto the beef 
extract. In case the entire yolk of the egg is not 
wanted, half of it stirred up in a tablespoonful of cold 
water will keep until the next day if put in a cool place. 
Or the cup can be filled with boiling water to begin with 
and the salt and extract of beef stirred up with it. 

3. A palatable Soup for 8 Persons made of Beef 
Extract. Figure on % pint of soup for every person ; a 
small quantity of water should be added for the boil- 
ing. In all, therefore, 3 quarts of water must be brought 
to a boil ; put in 1 pound of nicely washed beef without 
any bones, add a sufficiency of salt and skim carefully. 
Then add an onion cut up very fine, % of a large celery 
root— if it is small take %— and 4 tablespoonfuls of 
pearl barley , cover tightly and let the soup cook con- 
tinually for 2% hours over a moderate fire. 

Just before Kfirvi^jr put the yolk of an egg, nutmeg 
according fb taste, and a scant teaspoonful of beet 
extract into the tureen, then pour in the soup grad- 
ually, stirring*constautly to prevent t he egg from curd- 
ling. 

4. Clear White Beef Soup. For a large number of 
people take % pound of beef and for a smaller number 
take % pound for each person, to make a good, strong 
soup. The broth will greatly gain in strength if a 
chicken is cooked with the beef. In this case less of the 
latter will be required. If the meat is not to be brought 
to the table, cut it up and put it on the fire in water, 
% pint for every % pound of meat; after the meat has 
simmered, gently for about 30 minutes, skim carefully, 
immediately add- a celery root peeled and cut into pieces, 
the white end of a. leek or of an onion cut in pieces, a car. 
rot cut in half and the necessary quantity of salt, and 
cook until the meat is done. Then pass the broth 
through a sieve, and after it has settled pour it into the 
soup kettle again, being careful to keep back all the 
settlings, and cook once more, adding little dumplings, 
asparagus tips or small cauliflowers, drab ta jfe can be 

?ut into the tureen if desired; these must not be cooked^ 
ecause cooking makesJjheoiJto-UglL^ 

At the same time, rice, % tablespoonful to each 
person, may be scalded and cooked in clear broth; it

should be of a thick consistency, but the grain should 
remain whole. The rice is served with grated parmesan 
cheese as a side dish with the soup ; or the rice may be 
moulded in any pretty form, dusted with the grated 
cheese or dripped witlrcrab butter. A modern side dish 
served with the soup consists of cooked tomatoes. The 
tomatoes are cut up, cooked in beef broth and passed 
through a sieve and served in sauce dishes. 

Beef soup must be cooked from 2 — 3 hours, accord- 
ing to the age of the beef from which the meat is cut, 
sometimes even 4 hours, particularly the breast piece. 

5. Hasty Beef Soup. For 6 — 8 persons, 2 pounds 
of meat are cut into small cubes or thin slices. Take a 

Eiece of butter the size of half an egg and in this lightly 
rown 'a few tablespoonfuls of flour, put in the meat, a 
finely chopped onion, a carrot, together with a small 
celery root which has been cut into 8 pieces, stir for a 
short time and add as much boiling salted water as is 
wanted to make the desired quantity of soup, cover 
tightly, cook 1 hour, and pass through alieve. If rice 
is to be put into the soup it is cooked separately and 
added, with the celery, when the soup is served. Season 
with nutmeg according to taste. 

6. Clear Brown Beef Soup. Directions for the pre- 
paration of a brown broth will be found under No. 20, 
A. For a party of 12 people, take from 5 — 6 pounds of 
beef, and about 1 to 1% ounces of raw ham. Small 
dumplings can be cooked in this soup or brown sago if 
desired. 

7. Tomato Soup. Lightly brown a good sized piece 
of butterwith an onion, and in this stew 5 — 6 quartered 
tomatoes until soft, add 3 ounces of bits of toasted 
bread, a sufficiency of salt, and enough water to make 6 
plates of soup. Before serving, the soup is strained, 
and strengthened with beef extract. It must cook 1% — 2 
hours and be well bound. If the bread is not liked in 
the soup take flour which has been lightly browned in 
butter instead. 

Another way is to cook the tomatoes in meat broth 
until done, and pass through a sieve. 

8. Beef Soup with Pearl Barley and Rice. Follow 
the directions given under No. 1, but pass the stocfr 



Meat Soups. 19 

through a very fine sieve as soon as it has cooked % 
hour, then get a small piece of butter very hot in a 
small iron kettle and, for about 4 persons, stir with 
this about 1 heaping spoonful of flour until it is very 
lightly browned, and put the flour together with the 
broth (which must be poured from -the settlings very 
carefully) and the meat on the fire again. If it is to' be 
pearl barley soup the barley is to be added at once, 
also such soup vegetables as may be desired, but rice 
must be cooked only 1— % hours, as -observed in No. 1. 
An hour before serving a few button onions, asparagus 
tips or young kohlrabi can be cooked with the soup. 
Cauliflower makes a good addition to the soup, but 
must be cooked previously to putting it in, not so 
much, however, that it will fall to pieces ; asparagus for 
this kind of a soup needs no previous cooking. Shortly 
before serving, drop a few fresh, finely chopped celery 
leaves or a trifle of finely ground mace into the tureen-; 
dumplings can be added to the soup if desired. 

Remark. — Meat dumplings are preferable to all other kinds in weak soups, 
but the soup must not be made too thin, and it can easily be thickened by the 
addition of flour rubbed in butter, yet the latter should not be added sooner 
than 1 hour before serving. Those liking the flavor of celery can take 1 or 2 thick 
celery roots, clean them nicely, and cook them in the soup, then slice and serve 
with a dressing of olive oil, vinegar, pepper and salt as a salad. 

9. French (Vegetable) Soup. Take vegetables of 
various kinds in their season; in the Summer peas, 
asparagus, kohlrabi, smallcarrots ; in the Fall turnips, 
celery, savoy cabbage and kohlrabi. Cut up the vege- 
tables and let them simmer in fresh butter, cover with a 
good strong meat broth, cook until the vegetables are 
well done, season the soup with mace and chopped 
parsley and serve with the addition of small egg dump- 
lings or toasted bits of bread. 

10. Ox=Tongue Soup. When the tongue is nicely 
prepared, an ox-tongue soup is not less palatable than 
any made from other kinds of meat. In the first place 
cut away the yellow spongy meat close to the bone, dip 
the tongue in hot water, rub thoroughly with salt, 
wash carefully and rinse until clean, then cover the 
tongue with plenty of water, add salt (not too much), 
put on the fire and cook slowly without interruption 
from 3—3% hours. This broth can be used for potato 



20 B.— Sottps. 

soups according to Nos. 39 and 40. Any other soup 
can be made from a weak tongue broth by the addition 
of more or less beef extrac^, and will then be but little 
inferior to soups made from meats. 

For a small table, dishes of various kinds can be 
made from tongue. Taken hot from the soup, it is pal- 
atable with cabbage or savoy. Parts of the tongue can 
be divided, sliced, and when fried with salt, egg, and 
cracker crumbs it makes a good side dish with Brussels 
sprouts, asparagus, spinach, cauliflower, or other vege- 
tables ; the remainder can be made into a stew, but in 
this case the necessary broth is taken from the tongue 
after it is cooked, and put into a cool place. It is best 
to make the stew the following day; do not forget to 
add a few slices of lemon. 

The larger you can get the tongue, the more profit- 
able it will be. 

11. Ox-Tail Soup. Cut 2 ox-tails at the joints into 
pieces about 2 inches long, wash carefully, put on the 
fire in cold water, and leave until it begins to boil, then 
again rinse them in cold water. Clean the kettle care- 
fully, and put in some onions, carrots cut into small 
pieces, parsley root, leeks and celery, to which may be 
added a bay leaf and 6—8 peppercorns. Let it simmer 
with a piece of butter and a little salt for about 10 min- 
utes, then pour in 1% quarts of meat broth and a pint 
of white wine. Then the ox-tail and a few slices of pork 
fat, and remnants of raw ham are cookedin this until 
nearly done. Take the meat out of the broth, strain the 
latter through a fine strainer, take off the superfluous 
fat, add one more glass of Madeira and enough meat 
broth to furnish the desired quantity of soup,. say from 
2%— 3 quarts, and in this let the ox-tail cook until com- 
pletely done. 

Vegetables of T-arious kinds, such as peas, aspar- 
agus or carrota which have been cooked in a separate 
vessel in some meat broth, are now put into the tureen 
and the soup, which has been seasoned with a trifle of 
cayenne, is poured in as hot as possible. Frequently the 
meat is cut from the bones and served in the soup. 

According to the English method, the thick pieces 
are first fried with a few pieces of pork fat until they 
begin to color before . putting them into the boiling 



Meat Soups. 21 

broth, which has been made from the thinner pieces of 
the ox-tail, a piece of beef and a few pork kidneys. 

No vegetables are put into this soup, but only 1 
bay leaf, mace, and a piece of ginger for seasoning. 

' The soup is thickened with browned flour and 
butter, and receives an additional seasoning of Madeira 
and mushroom catsup. 

i2. Gravy Soup. Stew a thinly sliced onion with 
plenty of nice fresh butter, brown about 1 — 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour in this and add enough boiling water 
to make the desired quantity of soup. After cooking 
rice and a sliced celery root in this until done add your 
gravy. Be careful in preparing soups from roast meat 
gravies that the latter have not become unpalatable or 
sour. 

i3. Veal Soup. Take the veal according to the 
number of persons as directed under No. 4; a somewhat 
larger quantity than there given is needed, however, 
because it does not yield so much broth as the beef. 
Wash, cook in water with a trifle of salt and skim care- 
fully ; after it has cooked for about 30 minutes pass 
through a strainer, rub some flour in butter, and onto 
this slowly pour the veal broth from the settlings, add 
a parsley root and, an hour before serving, some 
scalded rice. If in season, asparagus or cauliflower can 
be added; the latter should be previously cooked; 10 
minutes before serving, meat balls or other kinds of 
dumplings may be cooked in the broth. Some people 
like a few purslane leaves or a little sorrel in veal soups. 
If you wish to substitute groats for the rice then leave 
out the flour, and put in a small piece of butter after 
the broth has been strained a,s directed under No. 8. 
When serving this soup, stir with it a little nutmeg or 
finely chopped parsley; the yolk of an egg is a palatable 
addition to veal soup, but in this case the latter must 
not be thickened too much. If the meat is to be 
brought to the table after the soup, the directions 
given under No. 4 should be heeded; serve with the 
meat prepared grated horse radish, or else turn it in a 
beaten egg with salt and pepper and fry in butter. The 
cooking will take from 1&—2 hours. 



22 B— Soups. 

14. Calf's -Head Soup. Take the head of a well 
fattened calf, clean, cover with water and a little salt, 
boil until tender and pass the broth through a strainer. 
For 10 persons, 3 heaping tablespoonfuls of flour are 
lightly browned in butter, and then 5% quarts of the, 
broth are slowly poured over this; if the broth should 
have become reduced too much through the boiling, 
add some water. When the soup begins to cook, season 
with a, pinch of saffron which has been previously dried 
and powdered, and add a dash of vinegar which has 
been made milder with a little sugar. A small cupful of 
vinegar of medium strength would be about the right 
proportion. Before serving stir the yolks of 5 eggs into 
the soup and also, according to taste, add about 6 
ounces of bits of bread toasted in butter. In the mean- 
time the calf's head should be split open; the brain 
taken out and put into the tureen, the meat-taken from 
the bones and cut into pieces, fried in butter and served 
after the soup with boiled potatoes and pickles. 

The boiled brain can also be cut into slices, sprin- 
kled with salt and pepper, turned in eggs and bread 
crumbs and fried in butter to a light brown color. 

15. Veal Sweetbread Soup. Prepare the sweetbreads 
according to A, 35, cut into small cubes and lightly 
brown in butter and flour. Cook for a short time 
in veal broth, salt slightly and stir with some finely 
chopped parsley or mace, and the yolks of eggs. This 
soup is also good for invalids, but then the seasoning 
must be omitted and the flour rubbed in a little butter 
but not browned, and % of a teaspoonful of extract of 
beef added to a pint of the soup. 

16. Princess Soup. Prepare 3 veal sweetbreads 
according to A, 35, and cook them for 15 minutes in a 
mild broth made from the extract of beef. Chop 2 of 
the sweetbreads very fine, simmer for a few minutes in 
melted butter and stir with the yolks of 5 hard boiled 
eggs to a uniform mass. Cook 3 ounces of lightly 
toasted bread in about 3 quarts of mild meat broth, 
then put in the sweetbread mass and cook the soup 
% hour longer. 3 hard boiled eggs and the other sweet- 
bread are cut into cubes, placed in the tureen, and 
sprinkled with a small glassful of Madeira. Season the 



Meat Soups. 23 

soup with cayenne pepper, strengthen witn a teaspoon- 
ful of extract of beef if necessary, pour over the ingredi- 
ents already in the tureen and serve. 

17. Mutton Broth. After washing the meat put it 
on the fire in boiling water, add salt, but not too much, 
skim carefully, put in 1 small celery root, a small kohl- 
rabi, a finely sliced onion, flour browned according to 
No. 8, and some pearl barley or scalded rice, cover 
tightly and let it simmer slowly; clear off the fat as 
soon as it appears, for if it is cooked with the soup too 
long the latter will receive an unpleasant taste. If you 
desire to put groats into the soup, this should be done 
about 30 minutes before the soup is served, stirring 
thoroughly. Potato dumplings may be put into the 
soup or the yolk of an egg, mace or minced parsley 
stirred With it. The length of time for cooking this 
soup is about 3 hours. 

18. Good Chicken Soup. For 5 persons take a large 
fat fowl which has been killed the day before and care- 
fully pick it clean and wash thoroughly in cold water. 
As fowls occasionally impart a strong flavor to soups, 
it is well to keep them in cold water for 15 minutes or 
so. The feet of uhe fowl can be utilized, if desired, by 
scalding them in boiling water, then take off the. skin, 
chop off the points of the toes and put the latter in the 
soup with the heart and stomach of the fowl. The liver 
should be kept back until the last and cooked in the 
soup about 3 minutes before serving. All chicken or 
poultry soups gain strength if the breast piece is first 
cut out with the bone, the legs and wings are parted at 
the joints, and all other larger bones are cracked. 

Put the fowl on the fire in 3 quarts of water and 
should it be an old one the water must be cold ; add a 
little salt, skim and follow the directions given under 
No. 8 with reference to pouring off the broth and 
browning the flour; then add a piece of fresh butter the 
size of a large walnut and let the soup cook slowly but 
uninterruptedly for about 3 hours, keeping the kettle 
tightly covered all the time. Eice, pearl barley or fancy 
noodles can be cooked with the soup if wished, but of 
vegetables the only proper kinds are parsley roots, 
salsify or asparagus. Celery, leeks and onions are too 



24 B.— Soups. 

strong for the delicate flavor of the chicken soup.. Crab 
dumplings (see 0, No. 2) or crab butter (see A, No. 9) 
are excellent in a good chicken soup, but bread-, groat- 
or egg dumplings are also good ; a trifle of mace is an 
appropriate seasoning for chicken soup, or instead of 
this a little finely chopped parsley and the yolks of 1—2 
eggs can be stirred into the soup. 

Soup cooked according to the above directions, but 
without the addition of either noodles, rice, etc., leaving 
it entirely clear with all the fat taken off, and thickened 
simply with lightly browned flour, then adding 4 yolks 
of eggs whipped with 1 cupful of sweetcrea m or aglass- 
ful of Rmnewine an d furthermore "adding, the roast 
meat of the chicken, which has been chopped very finely 
and passed through a strainer, makes what is known in 
Germany as "Queen's Soup". 

Another Germ an method is to omit the beaten yolks 
of eggs, and instead to mix the grated volks of a few 
hard boiled eggs with the chopped" meat of thechicken 
and then to heat them both in the soup. In some 
kitchens a glass of champagne i s added before the soup 
is served. <■""*"' 

The fowl may be served with the chicken gravy 
described under division R of this book, or if the roast 
meat has been used in the soup, the remainder can be 
used for chicken croquettes. 

19. Windsor Soup. (A fine soup for a dinner party 
of 10 persons) . Take 1 pound of chopped beef, % pound 
of veal, about % pound of raw ham and lightly brown 
this in 6 tablespoonfuls of butter togetherwith 1 onion, 
1 carrot and % celery root, cover the meat with 3 — 4 
quarts of meat broth or broth made from the extract of 
beef, add a chicken from which the breast piece has been 
cut away and cook all together slowly for 3 hours. In 
the meantime take the meat from the breast of the 
chicken, chop very finely and then add 2 eggs, grated 
bread, salt, and a' trifle of parsley, and make up into 
little dumplings which should be cooked in salt water 
just before serving. Macaroni broken into pieces are 
also cooked in salt water, soaked in an even tablespoon- 
fill of butter with 2 teaspoonfuls of sherry, and put in 
'the soup which has been thickened with browned flour 
and butter and strained. The soup can be still further 



Meat Soups. 25 

seasoned according to taste with a few glassfuls of 
sherry, or instead of the macaroni a baked nee pudding 
can be served as a side-dish. 

20. Oyster Soup. For 12 persons make 6 quarts of 
good beef broth, taking for this purpose 6 pounds of 
beef with some soup herbs, skim off the fat, pour the 
broth from off the settlings, clean out the kettle and 
again cook the broth, then thicken with % pound of 
fresh butter in which 4 tablespoonfuls of flour have 
been rubbed; in the meantime make 24 fish balls, open 
48 oysters and take them out of the shells, cook the 
beards of the oysters in the liquor of the oysters, then 
pass through a sieve, add to the beef broth, and cook 
the dumplings in it for a few minutes, stir the yolks of 
4 eggs with a little mace in a glassful of Ehinewine to 
which gradually add, stirring constantly, some of the 
boiling broth, and afterwards pour this into the soup, 
keeping up the stirring so that it will not curdle. After 
the soup commences to boil, take the kettle from the 
fire and then throw in the oysters, because cooking 
hardens them. Then immediately serve the soup to- 
gether with buttered toast. 

21. "Kaiser" Soup, Meat-Puree Soup of Wild Fowl 
and Rabbit or Hare. These soups are particularly nutri- 
tious for elderly persons or those in delicate health. 
Make a good brown meat broth and in this cook until 
done, 1 pheasant, 2 partridges, 1 snipe, 1 hare, take 
out the meat and let it partly cool. All of the meat 
is then taken from the bones, which are broken up, and 
cooked for another hour in the broth. The latter is 
then passed through a very fine strainer ; the best parts 
of the meat, which must be free from skin and not 
stringy, are then pounded very fine in a stone mortar, 
pass through a strainer and mix with the broth, which, 
amounting to about 3 quarts or more, is salted accord- 
ing to taste, receives a piece of butter and should be 
frequently stirred with a wooden spoon, but heated 
only and not again boiled. To thicken the soup slightly 
soak about- 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of bread crumbs 
with the meat broth and pound with the meat. This 
easily digestible soup contains all the strength of the 
game without any of the bones and sinews, combined 
with the best essence of the beef. 



26 B— Soups. 

22. Crab Soup. Make a good beef broth according 
to No. 1 and for 12 persons take about 30 — 40 crabs, 
which have been cleaned and prepared according to 
directions already given, and cook them in boiling 
water for 15 minutes. Pick the meat out of the tails 
and claws, crush the shells in a mortar, but not too 
fine, and put them on the fire with % pound of butter 
and stir until it begins to turn red and raise, then put 
in 4 tablespoonfuls of flour to thicken the soup. Pour 
over this 6" quarts of the beef broth, and then pass 
the whole through a sieve covered with cheese cloth. 
Shortly before serving add crab dumplings — (see 0, 
No. 2) and sweetbreads (A, No. 35) into the soup 
which has been brought to a boil again. Asparagus 
tips and small cauliflowers are also favorite additions 
to crab soups. The tails of the crabs are put into the 
tureen, just before serving. When thickening be careful 
not to get it too thick, and, by the way, avoid this 
with all soups made for dinner parties, 

23. Eel Soup (Bremen Style). For 3 quarts of 
soup boil 2 tablespoonfuls of fine pearl barley in a 
small quantity of water, then pour over this the neces- 
sary quantity of beef broth, and add shelled green peas, 
parsley or celery roots, cauliflowers, asparagus and a 
few small potatoes — the latter three ingredients should 
first be cooked — some chopped lettuce, celery, leek, 
parsley, purslane, salt and ground white pepper, tak- 
ing proportionately smaller quantities of the stronger 
herbs, cook all together for 30 minutes and then put 
in nicely cleaned pieces of eel about 2 inches long, which 
have first been cooked in salted water, and cook until 
done. 

Then make dumplings of fish force meat, cook them 
for a few minntes in the soup and stir this with the 
yolks of a few eggs, sweet cream, chopped thyme and a 
few drops of lemon juice; serve immediately. 

24. Eel Soup (Hamburg Style). Two pounds or 
more of heavy eels are rubbed in salt— it is best to do 
tffls the day previous to cook-ing— then washed, cut jn to 
pieces of suitable size, the head and the point of the tail 
cut off, and cooked in white wine, a very little wine 
vinegar, salt, white and black peppercorns, and 1 — 2 



Meat Soups. 27 

bay leaves. Cook a number of pears the day before in 
white wine and cinnamon as for a sauce, but without 
sugar. The pears should be cooked whole so that they 
may receive the full flavor of the wine and vinegar. 
The eel and the pears should be set aside in a cool place. 

When ready to cook, boil 2, 3 or 4 pounds of good 
beef in 1 pint of water to each pound of meat. Skim 
carefully and after cooking 1 hour throw in a soupplate- 
ful of carrots cut into little pieces, half as much parsley 
root also cut into small pieces, and 1 celery root, whole. 
At the same time take a handful of celery leaves, a 
handful of parsley, a few slips of sweet majoram, also a 
bit of thyme, burnet, houseleek, a few sorrel and sage 
leaves and some green leek, chop fine and put into the 
soup, and after it has cookad a few hours throw in a 
soupplateful of shelled green peas, a handful of purslane 
and of cauliflower. • Shortly before serving rub a table- 
spoonful of flour in a good-sized piece of butter, and stir 
it into the soup with some pepper. When ready to 
serve pour as much of the soup as will be needed into 
the tureen and add as much of the eel and of the pears 
(which must first be warmed) as will be proportion- 
ately enough, bringing the remaining pieces of the eel 
and the rest of the pears to the table in separate dishes. 
Should it then happen thai more soup is wanted than 
was prepared, the eel and pears can be passed around 
and the plates filled with what is remaining of the 
soup. 

Dumplings made according to directions given 
under 0, No. 2, are also put into the soup. 

If the eel soup is wanted for the family table, pre- 
pare a simple strong meat broth and in this cook for 
an hour before serving a plateful of green peas, another 
plateful of quartered pears and celery roots until done. 
Then put in a few eels which have previously been 
skinned, "cut into pieces and cooked in saltwater until 
half done; put in such soup herbs as can be obtained, 
cook until done. Thicken the soup if necessary and 
put in sponge dumplings (see under 0). Serve with 
sliced lemon. 

25. Fish Soup. Pickerel, pike, carp or freshwater 
fish of every kind are cut into pieces, turned in flour and 
baked in butter together with some slices of bread until 



28 B — Soups. 

light brown, then pour in some meat broth which has 
been made with celery, parsley roots and onions, or else 
the strained broth of shelled green peas, let the soup 
cook a little longer, pass through a sieve, shortly before 
serving bring to a boil again and serve with finely 
chopped parsley. Buttered toast cut into «mall pieces 
is served in the soup. 

if the broth has been prepared beforehand, this kind 
of soup can be gotten ready in 1 hour. 

For an ordinary fish soup the water in which fresh- 
water fish have been cooked will answer. This soup is 
best thickened with dried peas, cooked and strained; 
strengthen with extract of beef. 

26. Mock Turtle Soup. For 24—30 persons make a 
strong beef broth, taking 8 — 10 pounds of beef with the 
requisite soup herbs, onions, bay leaves, ground cloves 
and 2 — 3 whole cloves. Put on the fire a large well 
cleaned calf's head, a pig's jowl and ears, a nice beef 
bone and a smoked beef tongue; cook all together 
until done, but it must not be too tender. After the 
meats are cold, cut them up in small oblong pieces and 
also the tongue of the calf, which of course must be well 
cleaned, put all in the broth with the addition of small 
sausages, a pinch of cayenne pepper, several sweet- 
breads (see A, No. 35), and enough of the calf's head 
broth to make a sufficent quantity of soup, which 
should be thickened with browned flour and butter; 

After everything has cooked for 15 minutes, cook a 
number of veal meat balls in some veal broth or salted 
water and add them to the soup, together with several 
hard boiled eggs cut into small pieces, and also the 
brain of the calf which must first be washed in water, 
scalded, the small veins taken out, then cooked in water 
with a little vinegar, afterwards cut it into slices, turn 
in egg and bread crumbs and bake in butter ; further- 
more, put into the soup some catsup and, if they can be 
obtained, % bottle of Madeira and some oysters; the 
latter two, however, must not be cooked as long as the 
rest. 
■ Then immediately serve the soup. 

To make a very elegant mock-turtle soup small 
dumplings in imitation of turtle eggs must be added. 
Take the yolks of 3 hard boiled eggs, grate them finely 



Meat Soups. 29 

and mix with a small teaspoonf ul of flour, the yolk of a 
fresh egg, 1% tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and a trifle 
of nutmeg, make little balls the size of a marble, cook 
for a few minutes in boiling water. 

The beef broth as well as the head of the calf can be 
cooked the day before without detriment to the soup. 

A simple mock-turtle soup can be made by cooking 
the head of the calf together with the soup herbs, car- 
rots and a beef jaw; thicken with browned flour and 
butter, strengthen with about % teaspoonf ul of extract 
of beef for each quart of broth and then add tarragon, 
the chopped meat of the calf's-head, 1 glassful of arrac 
and hard boiled eggs cut into cubes. 

27. Hare Soup. When cleaning the hare, catch the 
blood ; crack the bones and cut the meat, excepting the 
saddle, into pieces, cook together with several pounds 
of beef, some ham, spices and soup herbs slowly for 
3 hours ; in the meantime fry the saddle in butter, cut 
up into pieces and put into the tureen. Pass the soup 
through a strainer, thicken with browned flour and 
butter and then add the blood, being careful to stir 
vigorously, also 2 glassfuls of Portwine, some cayenne 
pepper and salt, cook thoroughly and serve. 

According to the English method, only the hare is 
used and the time devoted to cooking does not exceed 
2 hours. For this soup cut up the whole hare and after 
setting aside the best pieces of the saddle, fry the rest 
of the meat with carrots, sliced ham, soup herbs and 
seasoning in butter to a light brown ; on this pour clear 
beef broth and cook as above. The saddle pieces are 
also fried, but they are then pounded very fine, mixed 
with some soaked bread or roll and % pint of Portwine 
and cooked with the soup. 

Sometimes rice is cooked in the soup, but a rice 
pudding served with the soup is preferable. 

A medium-sized hare will make enough soup for 
6 — 7 persons. 

28. Brown Soup made from the Bones of Hares, 
Game or Roasts. First remove all of the meat which 
may still adhere to the bones, chop very fine and stir 
with soaked and pressed bread, some fresh butter, sev- 
eral eggs, salt, pepper, nutmegs ; this is to be made into 



30 B.— Soups. 

small dumplings to be cooked in the soup later on. It 
is well to first test the dumplings to see whether they 
are too hard or too soft; in the first case put in 
another egg or some cream, in the latter some bread 
or cracker crumbs. The bones, in the meantime, are 
broken or cracked into small pieces and fried lightly in 
butter with sliced lean ham, onions, carrots and a pars- 
ley root, brown a few tablespoonfuls of flour and pour 
over all as much boiling water together with such lots 
of perfectly gdod gravy as you have left over. , Cook 
the soup for 2 hours, pass through a very fine strainer 
in order to catch the chips of bones that may be in the 
soup, then pour the soup back into the kettle, being 
careful to keep back the settlings, cook the dumplings 
until done, strengthen the soup with extract of beef and 
season with Madeira, cayenne pepper and salt. Should 
there be no meat on the bones, thicken the soup with 
browned flour and butter, or else cook the dumplings 
or the hearts of cabbages in the soup. Ordinarily the 
frying of the bones can also be omitted and then they 
need simply receive a long and slow cooking in water 
with' salt, spices and plenty of soup vegetables, but 
when thus made an addition of extract of beef is desir- 
able. 

29. Partridge Soup. Partridge soup is made like 
hare soup ; instead of the dumplings, the meat from the 
breast can be sliced very fine and served in the soup. 

30. Jacobine Soup. Put poached eggs, (see under 
L) into the tureen together with bits of toasted bread, 
cover with strong, hot beef broth and add chopped 
pieces of poultry roast. 

31. Beef Tea. Take about 1 pound of lean beef 
free from sinews ; it is necessary to have a vessel that 
can be hermetically sealed, and a large piece of absorb- 
ent or blotting paper. Cut the beef into small pieces, 
put into the vessel, close it and put into a kettle with 
boiling water and let it cook slowly 4 hours. Then 
pour through a very fine strainer into a warm cup, 
take off the fat with the blotting -paper by absorption, 
season with salt and stir into it the yolk of an egg. 
The given quantity of meat will make a medium sized 
cupful of beef tea. The meat can be utilized for hash or 
for meat balls. 



Meat Soups. 31 

32. Pigeon Soup for Invalids. The broth is pre- 
pared as directed under No. 1, and scalded rice is added 
immediately after the broth is skimmed; a few fresh* 
carrots or green' peas, or % hour before serving some 
asparagus tips or a little cauliflower (the latter must 
first be cooked) may be^dded. The soup must cook 
not less than 2 hours, because only old pigeons are to 
be used ; it should be well bound but not too thick, and 
if the invalid is entirely free from fever, the half of the 
yolk of a fresh egg may be stirred into it. Instead of 
rice, pearl barley is frequently put into soups of this 
kind ; the barley must first be scalded, slightly browned 
in butter, cooked with a few spoonfuls of the broth and 
be allowed to draw on top of the stove until the 
pigeon soup has cooked for about an hour; then cook 
them in the soup until completely done, after which a 
few asparagus tips only are added. 

33. Veal Soup for Invalids. Take a good chunky 
-piece of veal, skim the broth through a strainer, put in 
a small piece of fresh butter and some scalded rice, and 
cook until done with asparagus and cauliflower which 
have first been separately cooked. The yolk of afresh 
egg or a trifle of nutmeg or finely chopped parsley may 
be stirred in the soup if it is not contrary to the physi- 
cian's directions. 

34. Beef Broth Soup (Puree) for Invalids. Make a 
good clear beef broth according to No. 1; in 1 large cup- 
ful cook 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of grated wheatbread 
and after passing it through a sieve stir into it the 
breast of a chicken very finely chopped, which has first 
been thoroughly mixed" with 2 tablespoonfuls of sweet 
cream. The soup must not be cooked again and the 
yolk of an egg can be stirred in if desired. 

35. Game Soup with Tapioca. Take a partridge 
and make a clear broth free from fat, stir 2 even table- 
spoonfuls of tapioca with 4 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 
cook for 10 minutes in the broth, and finally add a few 
asparagus tips or small cauliflowers, which have prev- 
iously been cooked in salted water until done. Any 
other kind of game can be used, but it must first be 
slightly roasted, covered with cracked veal bones, salt, 



32 B— Soups. 

soup vegetables and the necessary amount of water, 
and cook slowly for 3 hours before the broth is strained 
and other ingredients, as taste suggests, are added. 

Besides the last five of these soups, Nos. 2, 16, 17 
and 19 are well adapted for the sick room. 



II. VEGETABLE AND HERB SOUPS. 

36. Soup, Vegetables and Meat. This dish makes 
0, palatable, nutritious and cheap dinner, and can be 

' prepared either from fresh peas or such as have become 
slightly hard, (the latter must be straiued after cook- 
ing) as well as from young kohlrabi -, cauliflowers or 
even potatoes. Get a piece of butter or lard very hot, 
in this brown 2 heaping tablespoohfuls of fine flour, 
pour the necessary quantity of water over all, stirring 
it, and as soon as it commences to boil add the desired 
vegetables, either a heaping soupplateful of shelled 
green peas and soup vegetables cut into pieces, or 2 
sliced kohlrabi, some salt, and cook until tender and 
the soup becomes rather thick. If the soup is to be 
made with potatoes follow the directions given under 
No. 38 for a potato soup, cook with either a piece of 
leek or a celery root, then with a tablespoon cut from 
the boiled meat 16 dumplings (see 0, beef or veal 
dumplings) shaping them by turning them back and 
forth with the spoon; it is advisable, however, to try 
them to see that they are not too flabby or too hard ; 
then cook the dumplings for about 5 minutes, that is to 
say, until done, after which the soup should not cook 
any longer, then stir a small head of finely chopped 
parsley into it. If no potatoes are cooked in the soup, 
serve them boiled as a separate dish. 

37. Russian Cabbage Soup. (Borsch). {Original 
receipt.) Take about six pounds of beef for the stock. 
Clean 6 small red beets, cut into long thick slices, turn 
in flour, cover tightly and stew in butter for % hour. 
Besides this take a small head of cabbage, quarter it, 
cover with boiling water, put the "lid on the kettle and 
set aside for % hour. After the broth has cooked for 1% 



Vegetable and Herb Soups. 33 

hours, put in the beets and then % hour later the cab- 
bage; celery, root, small carrots, and green leek must 
not be forgotten. After all is thoroughly well cooked 
add % pint of sour cream into which a heaping table- 
spoonful of flour has been stirred, and when the cooking 
is done, stir the yolk of an egg into the soup and serve 
with small sausages. 

38. "Potato Soup. Put the bones of fresh or roast 
meats on the lire, together with meat remnants of fresh 
meat, adding the proper amount of salt, skim, put in 
onions, leek and a celery root, and cook slowly for 1% 
hours. In the meantime cook the potatoes in a separ- 
ate kettle until they are almost soft, add them to the 
soup and after the cooking is well done, strain. Stir a 
finely chopped bunch of parsley or else grated nutmeg 
into the soup, then serve with bits of toasted bread. 

Potato soup can also be made without meats, tising 
water only, but in this case it must have plenty of vege- 
tables, and also some flour browned in butter and a 
teaspoonful of extract of beef must be cooked with it. 

39. A very fine Potato Soup. Fry 2 platefuls of 
sliced raw potatoes with a chopped onion in 2 even 
tablespoonfuls of butter to a light brown color until 
nearly done, throw them without the butter into 3 
quarts of boiling water, in which some soup vegetables 
have been cooked for 15 minutes previously, add suffi- 
cient salt and cook the soup for % hour; then pass 
through a sieve, and in the fat which remains from 
frying the potatoes brown 1 tablespoonful of flour, add 
this to the soup, strengthen with a small teaspoonful of 
extract of beef and 2 tablespoonfuls of claret, let it 
come to a boil, and then serve with toasted bits of 
bread. 

40. Oatmeal Soup with Potatoes. Soak the oat- 
meal in water, about 1 heaping teaspoonful for each 
person, and. then cook in water with the addition of 
some good fat (broth from cooked smoked meats or 
ham mixed with water is excellently adapted for the 
purpose), kohlrabi, celery, parsley and green leek, or if 
these are not obtainable, take a few finely chopped 
onions, add nicely washed potatoes and the necessary 



34 B— Soups. 

salt; cook for about 2 hours until thoroughly done 
and of a medium thickness. A little extract of beef can 
be added to this soup advantageously. 

Instead of oatmeal coarse pearl barley (groats) can 
be taken. Cook with pork fat until white and do not 
fill up with the broth or the water until the groats are 
entirely soft. 

41. Early Vegetable Soup. Rub some flour in but- 
ter, add as much water as is wanted to make the de- 
sired quantity of soup, salt, and cook therein the fol- 
lowing early vegetables until done: celery and parsley 
roots, lettuce, spinach, sorrel, purslane and peas. Stir 
some cream into the soup and add wheat bread toasted 
in butter. 1% hours are sufficient to cook this soup. 

42. Green Pea Soup. Shell the peas, and, without 
washing them, let them simmer for a short time in a 
piece of melted butter and then, according to the quan- 
tity of soup desired, let 1 — 2 tablespoonfuls of flour 
draw in this, then pour on the requisite quantity of 
broth or boiling water and add a little extract of beef. 
When the peas are quite tender, put in salt and chopped 
parsley. Groat- or meat -dumplings may be cooked in 
the soup and served with small pale sippets of bread 
fried in butter. Time of cooking, 1 hour. 

43. Vegetable (Puree) Soups made from Extract of 

Beef, These easily digestible soups are made from par- 
rots, beets or turnips. The. kind of vegetable selected 
for the soup is nicely cleaned, cooked in water until 
tender, passed through a colander, stirred with some 
good beef broth and then cooked until quite thick with 
salt and bread crumbs, or, omitting the latter, stir 
constantly while cooking and then serve with a piece of 
butter and fried bits of bread placed in the tureen: In 
the spring of the year an asparagus puree soup made 
from chicken broth is very palatable. The asparagus, 
with the exception of the tips, is cooked in the broth 
until tender. The soup is passed through a strainer, 
thickened with browned flour and butter and then the 
tips of the asparagus are also cooked until tender. Stir 
into the soup a number of yolks of eggs whipped in 
sweet cream. 



Vegetable and Herb Soups. 35 

A soup can be made from the cauliflower, first 
cooking them until they are half done, then cook in 
butter until entirely done, pass through a strainer and 
make up with meat broth and stir an egg into it. 

44. German Soup. (Especially recommended for 
the months of August and September.) Carrots cut 
into cubes, sliced string beans and kohlrabi are stewed 
in butter for % hour ; then cook in enough boiling salt- 
water to make the necessary quantity of soup; the 
vegetables should be tender but not overdone. Shortly 
before serving add a few well-cooked new potatoes, 
young cauliflower, hearts of cabbages and particularly 
the pulp of 6 large tomatoes and 1 teaspoonful of ex- 
tract of beef; season with pepper and serve over small 
baked kidney slices. 

45. "Schweriner" Soup. Take 1 sliced cucumber, 
the center leaves of several heads of lettuce, a few early 
eschalots and a plateful of shelled green peas, and sim- 
mer in hot butter until nearly done; as seasoning add 
parsley, chervil and burnet all finely chopped together 
with salt, pepper and a pinch of ginger; fill in the boil- 
ing broth and cook the soup for an hour, thicken with 
lightly browned flour and butter, stir into it the yolks 
of a few eggs and serve with small marrow bits. 

46. Old Pea Soup.. Old peas can be utilized best in 
soups. Put them on the fire in boiling water with a 
piece of kidney suet, cook until tender and pass through 
a sieve; cook the broth once more, add salt, a piece of 
butter and lightly browned flour, and stir with chopped 
parsley and a little extract of beef. Meat balls make a 
very palatable addition to the soup. Time of cooking, 
2 hours. 

47. Split Pea Soup. Pick the peas over carefully, 
rub them between the hands in warm water and clean 
then nicely; put them on the fire in cold soft water and 
if the peas are very old, add a trifle of bicarbonate of 
soda (cooking soda, Bee No. 1) on the fire, and cook 
slowly for a short % hour, which will make them quite 
tender; after cooking- put them on a colander, pour 
water over them and cook slowly in boiling water until 



36 B.— Soups. 

done, with the addition of some fat, a piece of beef or a 
sausage, together with a celery root and green leek. 

If it is desired to cook a smoked pork sausage or a 
pickled pigshead in the soup (well liked by some), the 
sausage must first be washed and cooked, in order to 
take from it the smoky flavor which would injure the 
soup. If the sausage has been kept for some time and is 
consequently no longer juicy, it should be laid in warm 
water for a day and night; salt pork should be first 
cooked in water until done, and only as much of the 
salty broth put into the pea soup as can be done with- 
out making the latter too salty. Peas, beans and simi- 
lar vegetables do not require much salt. 

After the peas have become quite tender take out 
the meat and the celery root, put the latter into the 
tureen, pass the peas through a strainer and cook them 
with the meat until well done ; if necessary, thin with a 
little broth. If no onions were at first put into the 
peas they can be added later on, first chopping them 
up finely, then brown in butter and stir into the soup, 
Bits of bread fried in butter may also be added if wished. 

A mild flavor can be given to the pea soup by cook- 
ing 2 sliced carrots, 2 small bunches of fresh parsley 
and a little sugar in it; this gives it the flavor almost 
of a soup made of new peas. 

The soup must not be thick but it should be nicely 
bound. If its consistency is not just right, flour browned 
in butter can be used ; but this should only be done in 
case the peas have either not been cooked long enough 
or are too old, or if the soup has become too thin. The 
pure flavor of the peas is impaired by the addition of 
the flour. Ordinarily, a few small potatoes s can be 
cooked in the soup after the peas have been strained, 
but they must not be overdone, and if the soup should 
stiffen through cooking too long, it should be thinned 
somewhat. 

- The time of cooking depends upon the quality of 
the peas. If they are "good they will be tender in about 
2 hours, otherwise it will take from 3 — i hours. 

48. White Bean Soup. The very small white beans 
are the best because they taste nicer and need not be 
strained. • After washing the beans put them on the fire 
in cold water— 1 pound of beans for 6 persons— and let 



Vegetable and Herb Soups. 37 

them cook well for % hour ; pour them on the colander 
and immediately put them back into the kettle, which 
has been cleaned in the meantime, with fat or butter 
and enough boiling water to cover; the beans are 
cooked until they are tender, being careful to frequently 
add a dash of boiling water ; they must not be stirred 
very often so that they will remain whole and yetmake 
a good thick soup; they are afterwards salted and 
reduced with boiling water to make the soup, and once 
more cooked after a small quantity of meat broth or 
extract of beef is added. A smoked pork sausage which, 
has first been cooked, or a small piece of smoked nam, 
according to the opinion of some people, will improve 
the flavor of the soup, or 5 minutes before serving 
"Frankfurt" or "Wiener" sausages can be put into it 
and, if liked, a number of small potatoes which have 
first been separately cooked. In some German kitchens 
thyme or majoram are a favorite seasoning for bean 
soup. 

A few tart apples cooked in the soup give it a very 
pleasant flavor, which can be still further improved by 
adding a teaspoonful of crab butter before serving. 

49. Lentil Soup. Lentils should be cooked in an 
enameled vessel to prevent them from turning dark, and 
they will be much improved by pour ing off some of the 
water and r enewing it t wice alter cooking about 15 
minutes at each time, and'tneh let them cook slowl y in 
not too much water but with pjenty of f aL_ A*ftier "this 
thin to the proper consistency wrthiblie broth of pickled 
meat and cook until done with small potatoes, some 
leek or sliced onions browned in butter. If this kind of 
soup is made with water and fat only, a large lump of 
pork forcemeat should be cooked with it until done. 
Serve with cooked prunes. 

Lentil soup can also be cooked like a pea soup with 
"Frankfurt" or smoked pork sausages or a piece of 
pork, but the lentils should remain whole; flour should 
be browned with onions and some good fat, to thicken 
the soup if it should be too thin. Serve with vinegar. 

Time of cooking, 2—4 hours. 

50. Lentil Soup with Partridges. This is a meat 
puree soup and gains very much in nutritive qualities 
through the addition of the lentils. It is advantageous 



38 B— Soups. 

to take an already roasted chicken, the bones of part- 
ridges or old partridges. The best meat is stripped 
from the bones and the latter are then crushed in a 
mortar and cooked 1—2 hours with soup herbs and an 
onion, after which the soup is strained. In the mean-' 
time, cook X pound of lentils with a piece of butter in 
not too much water until thick, pass through a sieve 
and stir with the partridge broth. If you have the 
breast pieces of partridges, take out the sinews, clean 
off the skin and all gristle, cut into fine slices and put 
into the tureen at once, because cooking will harden 
the meat. Should there be any meat left, pound it as 
finely as possible, stir it into the soup, letting it cook 
M hour longer, then pass through a strainer once more 
and serve very hot, pouring it over the breasts of the 
partridges and slices of wheat bread nicely fried in but? 
ter. ' 

51. Sorrel Soup. Sorrel should be raised in every 
garden. It is very wholesome and in the Spring it 
makes a palatable and refreshing soup. Lightly brown 
plenty of flour in good butter, rub nicely washed tender 
leaves of the sorrel in this and cook in veal broth or 
water, after supplying.the necessary salt. Stir into the 
soup nutmeg, thick cream and the yolks of a few eggs 
and serve over fried wheat bread placed in the tureen. 
Instead of the bread small egg dumplings can be cooked 
in the soup. It should be nicely thickened, but must not 
be too stiff. A little extract of beef will prove a desir- 
able addition. 

Time of cooking, % — % hour. 

52. Silesian Celery Soup. Clean 2 thick celery roots, 
a piece of green leek and 1 parsley root, and boil tender 
in 2 quarts of water, adding the" necessary salt; then 
brown 2 tablespoonfuls of flour in 1 tablespoonful of 
good butter, stir the broth into this, add the herbs 
(leaving out the celery) and serve as hot as possible. A 
small addition of extract of beef improves the flavor of 
the soup. 

After the celery roots have been cooked until tender 
they can be sliced and made into a salad with olive oil 
and vinegar, and served as a side dish with the roast. 

The French way of making this soup is much simp- 
ler ; 4 celery roots are divided and cooked in water with 



VEGETABLE AND HERB SOUPS. 39 

double the quantity of potatoes cut into pieces, salt, 
pass through a strainer, add a small piece of butter and 
little extract of beef and season with a small bunch of a 
chopped celery. Both kinds of soup are served with 
toasted bread. , 

Time of cooking, 1% hours. 

53. Hotch Potch or Scotch Soup. This very whole- 
some, nutritious and palatable soup is a favorite Scotch 
dish for the ordinary table. "Although generally made 
from mutton and vegetables of all kinds, yet it is also 
very good when made with beef or veal, or fresh pickled 
pork. 

In the Summer take for about 8 persons, 2 pounds 
of mutton from the shoulder, the neck or the ribs, 2 
quarts of shelled green peas, not too young, 1 pint of 
large beans, 1 — 2 cauliflower-heads cut up fine, 1 quart 
of fresh kohlrabi cut into cubes, 1 quart of carrots also 
cut up, 1 head of cabbage, 1—2 heads of curled (savoy) 
cabbage cut into fine shreds, 1 dozen chopped white 
onions and a handful of purslane and celery leaves. 

Cook the meat 2 hours in 2 quarts of water, then 
gradually add the above-named vegetables, putting in 
the cauliflower last; salt, and let the soup cook 2 hours 
longer until everything is nice and tender. The meat 
can be separated from the bones and served in the 
soup, or it may be brought to the table after the soup 
with the potatoes, butter and parsley or a gravy. 

This soup can also be cooked as Scotch broth by 
making it thinner and chopping the vegetables as finely 
as possible and adding some salsify. If it is noj:to be 
the principal dish at dinner, cook the vegetable soup 
with a mild beef broth strengthened with a little ex- 
tract of beef, and omit the meat. In the Fall and in 
theWinter enough of this soup can be cooked to last for 
several days. 

In the Winter, take instead of the peas % pound of 
coarse gjoats, let them stand over night covered with 
water, and then cook with the meat and such vege- 
tables as are obtainable. 

54. Soup a l'aurore. Peel and scrape 3 carrots, 
3 potatoes and 3 onions, cut into thin slices, add a few 
small celery leaves and cook together in 2 quarts of 



40 B.— Soups. 

water until soft enough to pass through a sieve. After 
the latter is done, put the soup on the fire again with 
1 heaping tablespoonful of butter, 1 even teaspoonfiil 
of extract of beef and the same quantity of salt, stir 
slowly until thoroughly cooked and serve with bits of 
toasted bread. 



55. Herb Soups for Invalids. Take % pound of 
boneless beef and make 1 pint of clear broth with salt, 
but skim off all the fat, pass through a sieve and then 
cook in it for 10 minutes 1 ounce of bread- or cracker 
crumbs. Chop beforehand 1 ounce of sorrel and the 
same quantity of chervil, spinach and a piece of parsley 
root, simmer slowly in butter until tender and pass 
through a sieve, then mix with the yolks of 2 eggs and 
slowly pour the beef broth over this vegetable puree. 
The soup need not be cooked again— it is served imme- 
diately. When fats are forbidden the herbs are to be 
cooked in salt water until done. 

Soups Nos. 41, 42, 43 and 51 are also adapted for 
the sickroom. 



III. WINE AND BEER SOUPS. 

56. White Wine Soup. 2 tablespoonfuls of fine 
flour and the yolks of 6 very fresh eggs are stirred with 
1 bottle of white wine or cider, and 1 bottle of water 
sweetened with plenty of sugar. Put in a few lemon 
slices without the seeds, add a pinch of salt, and then 
cook over a hot fire in a clean kettle, stirring constantly 
with an egg beater, and pour into the tureen immedi- 
ately, first putting in some mace. The whites of the 
eggs, beaten to a froth, can be made into little balls, 
put on the soup, sprinkled with sugar, and when the 
tureen is covered they will be done in a few minutes. 

If the whole eggs are used instead of the yolks only 
and only % of the flour be taken, it makes a wine froth 
soup. 

Serve with these soups small crackers or toast, 
which can also be dusted with sugar. 



Wine and Beer Soups. 41 

57. Another Wine Soup. Lightly brown 2 ounces 
of flour in 2 even tablespoonfuls of butter, stir this 
smooth with 1 bottle of white wine a nd 1 pint of water, 
add 3 heaping teaspoonfuls" of sugar and a trifle of 
salt. This soup is seasoned variously with lemon or 
orange peel, peach or orangeflower water, or with fresh 
fruit, such as strawberries or raspberries, simply letting 
them boil-up once in the soup. The yolks of a few eggs 
may be stirred in the soup if desired. 

58. Sago Soup with Claret. Scald pure sago twice 
with water, then put On the stove with hot water, add a 
piece of cinnamon and cook until done,' which will take 
from 2—2% hours. Then add the same quantity of 
claret, sweeten the soup well with sugar, let it come to a 
boil, put in a few slices of lemon and serve with crackers 
or fresh toast. 

59. Hasty Cracker Soup. Water, crackers, some 
butter, a few pieces of cinnamon, lemon peel and salt in 
proportions according to the quantity of soup desired 
are put oh the fire and cooked until done; then pass 
through a sieve and stir into it the yolks of a few eggs, 
sweet cream, wine and sugar. 

60. Pearl Barley and White Wine Soup. Put the 

barley on the fire with a little boiling water, a small 
piece' of fresh butter, some cinnamon and lemon peel, 
and cook slowly in a scant broth (replenishing the hot 
water frequently) until done. After the soup has cooked 
for 2 hours, put in raisins that have first been washed, 
and let them cook until soft. When serving add wine, 
sugar and a trifle of salt, and stir into the soup the 
yolks of 1 or 2 eggs. 

61. A nice Soup made from Coarse Barley Groats. 

Put 1 pound of groats on the fire in a little boiling 
water with a small piece of butter, a few pieces of cinna- 
mon and a little salt, replenishing the boiling water 
from time to time and cook until quite soft. Then pass 
the whole through a sieve, during which operation some 
water should be poured over the barley in order to 
retain in the soup everything that will tend'to thicken 
t. After about % hour, cook about % pound' of well- 
cashed raisins in the soup until soft. The soup should 



42 B.— Soups. 

be well bound but not thick. When ready to serve, stir 
the yolks of 2 fresh eggs together with % pint of white 
wine in the tureen and pour in the boiling soup gradu- 
ally, stirring constantly, and sweeten with sugar. This 
will make enough soup for 8 — 10 persons Instead of 
the barley the soup can be made with very fine barley 
meal stirred in it, which is cooked about 10 minutes 
until done, first boiling the raisins in water with some 
butter. 

This soup can also be made from grits (fine midd- 
lings) ; in this case first cook the raisins, stir the grits 
with sugar, salt and the proper quantity of water, add 
sufficient boiling water to make as much soup as is 
wanted, and after the grits are thoroughly cooked,, stir 
the soup as above directed. In both soups cider or 
white currant wine can be used to excellent advantage. 

Time of cooking, 3 hours. 

62. Rice Soup with Raisins. Lightly brown a little 
butter in a spoonful of flour, take the necessary quan- 
tity of boiling water, scalded rice, cleaned and washed 
raisins and a small piece of cinnamon. Cook all until 
well done and stir the soup with salt, sugar, a litte wine, 
and the yolks of a few eggs. 

63. Frothy Beer Soup. 1 quart of beer (which must 
not be bitter), 1 quart of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of fine 
wheat flour, 4- eggs, sugar, 2 slices of lemon and cinna- 
mon according to taste are whipped with an egg beater 
over a hot fire until nearly cooked; pour into the tureen 
immediately. Serve with buttered toast or crackers. 

A palatable addition to this kind of soup consists 
of a bread pudding made from pieces of rye bread mixed 
with flue sugar, ground cinnamon and scalded currants. 
Fry the bread in butter until of a light brown color, 
press tightly into a large funnel or similar mold and, 
turn into the tureen. 

64. Hasty Beer Soup. Take % pint of beer for each 
person and the same quantity of water, cook, and add 
the necessary quantity of sugar and a pinch of salt. 
Then stir the yolk of 1 egg and 1 heaping teaspoonful 
of flour -together with some cold water and gradually 
pour the boiling beer over it, constantly stirring, and 



Wine and Beer Soups. 43 

fchen put back into the kettle. The stirring should be 
kept up continually, even after the kettle has been 
taken from the fire, to prevent curdling. 

If desired, the white of an egg can be beaten to a 
froth with some sugar, taken up with a spoon and put, 
on the soup, or else the froth may be beaten through 
the soup. 

65. Beer Soup with Raisins. Cook plenty of raisins 
with water and wheat bread until the raisins are quite 
soft, then add enough beer to give the soup good 
strength, sweeten with sugar and when it cooks put in 
according to the quantity of soup % — 1 tablespoonf ul of 
flour stirred in water, and then stir through the soup 
(which should not be too thin nor too stiff) the yolks of 
a few eggs and some cinnamon. When eggs are lacking 
the flour can be stirred up with good cream or milk. 

66. Bee'r Soups with Milk. For 3 — 4 persons take 
1 pint of milk with its cream, 1 pint of water, % pint of 
strong but not bitter beer, 2 ounces of currants, 1 table- 
spoonful of flour, 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar, % 
teaspoonful of salt and the yolk of an egg. Put every- 
thing excepting the egg and the salt in a deep kettle on 
a hot fire and bring it to a boil, stirring constantly and 
briskly; take- the kettle from the fire immediately, keep 
up the stirring for a few minutes longer, otherwise it 
will curdle easily, add some salt and then stir into it the 
yolk of the egg and some ground cinnamon. Serve with 
biscuits or toast. 

If you have no time to devote to stirring the soup; 
and without which it will curdle, then the water, beer, 
currants and flour should be brought to a boil, cook 
the milk in a separate vessel, take both from the fire, 
pour together and stir the yolk of the egg into the 
soup. 



67. Wine Soup for Invalids. Good claret, Portwine 
or sherry are absolutely essential for these soups, which, 
by the way, should never be serv ed to invalids unless 
with the^consent of J^pjiJ^icTah. Take pure sago or 
tapioca, pound the sago and^soaK in cold water for 
3 hours. Then drain, and afterwards cook it with water

and a small piece of candied ginger (the latter is omitted 
when claret is used) until transparent, add the wine, 
some lemon juice and sugar and serve with crackers. 
Tapioca is simply cooked in the water until done with- 
out any previous soaking. When claret is used, the 
addition of a few teaspoonfuls of pineapple, raspberry 
or strawberry jelly will greatly improve the flavor of 
the soup. 

Nos. 57, 60 and 61 are also good soups for invalids. 



IV. MILK SOUPS AND WATER SOUPS. 

Note.— It is well to keep a paj^jejjlaE. Vfttitjg for 
cooking mjlk «""p^, because the milk scorches very 
easily and the flav or of food t hat has been previously 
cooked, in ,thfi_ kettle is reaicTily impartejjlaalth^mflk. 
Scorching maybe preventecTby 'first greasing the. bot^~ 
torn of the kettle 'with a piece of pork fat, or at least 
first rinsing the kettle with cold water. 

68. Fine Milk Soups served either warm or cold. 

For 3 persons take 1 quart of fresh milk, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch, the yolks of 2 eggs, sugar, lemon peel 
or a little vanilla, or a few pounded bitter almonds. 
Stir over a hot fire constantly until cooked and then 
pour into the tureen. Make a stiff froth of the whites of 
eggs, and form into little balls as directed under No. 56, 
or else the froth can be mixed with sugar and stirred 
into the soup until the latter is frothy through and 
through. 

Remake. — During the hot season, this soup, served cold, makes an excellent 
and convenient dish for the supper table and for this purpose it can be cooked 
in the forenoon. 

69. A very nutritious Milk Soup. Bring 3 quarts 
of milk to a boil. Whip 1 — 2 eggs, stir up with fine flour 
and reduce the stiff dough with cold milk and pour into ' 
the boiling milk without stirring; pass a spoon over 
the bottom of the kettle several times to loosen the 
mass, and break it up into lumps, and then cook until 
these are done. Salt the soup moderately and pour 
into the tureen at once to prevent scorching. 



Milk Soups and Water Soups. 45 

70. Grits (Middlings) Soup with Milk. Put the 

grits into the boiling milk, constantly stirring, and 
cook with salt, sugar and some butter until nice and 
thick. It can consist of water to the amount of %. For 
1 person the right proportion would be % pint and 1 
tablespoonful of grits according to quality. 

71. Noodle Soup with Milk. This soup is cooked 
according to the directions given for the grits soup 
preceding. 

72. Rice Soup with Milk. Wash the rice and put 
on the fire in cold water, and after the water has become 
quite hot, pour it off, because some varieties of rice are 
somewhat acidulous, causing the milk to curdle; after 
this cook the rice on a hot fire until done. If fresh milk 
is used for the soup, it can be reduced one-half with 
water, and % pint of milk with an even tablespoonful of 
rice will be the right proportion for each person. 

Cook half of the milk with the water, put in a few 
pieces of cinnamon and the rice, and cook slowly until 
tender; then add the remainder of the milk and a little 
sugar and salt, and let the soup cook for a short time 
longer. If it is desired that the soup should be a little 
thicker, add at last some cornstarch stirred in water, 
but no flour because the latter spoils the flavor of the 
soup; the cornstarch should simply cook until done. 
As noted, flour impairs the flavor of the soup, but if it 
must be used then the soup should cook with the flour 
under constant stirring for 15 minutes. - 

73. Soup with Pearl Barley and Milk. Wash the 
barley, put on the fire with a small piece of butter and a 
little water and cook slowly with a scant broth until 
tender, replenishing the water as often as necessary, 
then add milk and a little salt, and cook the soup until 
thick; if not thick enough to suit, put in a little corn- 
starch which has first been stirred in water. It can be 
flavored with sugar and cinnamon or mace. 

In the same manner good soups can be made from 
pure sago or from coarse barley which must be soaked 
the night before in water. 

Time of cooking, 2 hours. The quantities and 
weights of ingredients are the same as given in the pre- 
ceding receipts. 



46 B— Soups. 

74. Pearl Sago Soup with Milk. Put the sago into 
the boiling milk which has been thinned somewhat with 
a little water, otherwise the sago will dissolve com- 
pletely. After the elapse of%—% hour the sago should be 
soft, then stir into it some cornstarch and salt, and 
add, according to taste, sugar and cinnamon ; the yolk 
of an egg can also be stirred into the soup if wished. 

Take a pint of milk and 1 ounce of sago for eacn 
person. 

75. Oatmeal Soup with Milk. Drain the oatmeal 
several times and then cook in water until tender and 
of a medium thickness, stirring occasionally because it 
adheres to the kettle easily and scorches. After strain- 
ing, put it on the stove again, add milk and some salt 
and let it cook 15 minutes more. 

Take 1 — 1% ounces of oatmeal and % pint of fresh 
or 1 pint of skimmed milk for each person ; the first 
is preferable. 

76. Cornmeal Soup. To cook this very nutritious 
and cheap soup, mix water and milk half and half and 
bring to a boil, stir in enough cornmeal until it has the 
proper consistency, and put in some salt. 

77. Chocolate Soup. Put % pound of chocolate on 
the fire in a cupful of water, and after it is soft stir until 
quite smooth, and then add 2 quarts of milk and sugar 
according to taste; as soon as it commences to cook, 
flavor the soup with vanilla or cinnamon and stir into 
it the yolks of 1 — 2 eggs. The whites of the eggs- may 
be beaten to a- froth and put on the soup in the form of 
little balls, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. This 
quantity of soup is calculated for 5 persons and is 
served over bits of bread toasted in butter placed in 
the tureen. 

78. Buttermilk with Fine Pearl Barley, also good 
for Invalids. Put the barley on the fire in water and 
cook until tender; then add the buttermilk, into which 
some flour has been stirred, with salt, sugar and cinna- 
mon according to taste. 

79. Buttermilk with Prunes or Raisins. After care- 
fully washing and rinsing them, cook until soft in water 
into which some anise seed can be put and, according to 



Milk Soups and Water Soups. 47 

taste, grated rye bread. Grate some wheat bread and 
put it into the soup with the buttermilk into which 
some flour should be stirred to prevent curdling, and 
boil under constant stirring. When serving, stir in 
salt, sugar and some cinnamon. 

80. Brown Flour Soup. Lightly brown the flour 
without any butter as directed under A, No. 3, boil the 
milk and stir into it enough of the browned flour and 
cold milk as is necessary to give the soup consistency, 
then stir through it sugar, cinnamon and the yolks of 
eggs, and serve over bits of bread toasted in butter 
which have been placed in the tureen. 

81. White Flour Soup. Heat a piece of butter the 
size of half an egg, put in 3 tablespoonfuls of flour and 
stir until it commences to curl and bubble; then pour 
in the required quantity of boiling water, stirring care- 
fully, so that the flour will remain smooth and not 
become lumpy. When done, stir the soup with salt, 
mace or lemon peel, a trifle of sugar and the yolk of an 
egg, or else serve without any spice or sugar, putting 
in salt, sour cream and finely chopped parsley. 

82. Onion Soup (South Germany Style). For 4 
persons, lightly brown 3 large onions, cut up into small 
cubes in 2% tablespoonfuls of butter, in this also brown 
lightly 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, and then pour in 
enough meat broth to make the necessary quantity of 
soup, and cook thoroughly. Then pass through a 
sieve, cook once more, stir with 2 yolks of eggs, and 
serve over bits of bread toasted in butter, placed in the 
tureen. 

83. Soup made with Pastry Dough. Break the 
dough into pieces and put it on the fire in cold water; 
after it has been cooked to a pulp put in a piece of 
butter or good fat and gradually pour on boilingwater. 
Before serving, put in some finely .chopped parsley, beat 
up the yolk of an egg in a tureen, with some sour 
cream, and then pour in the soup, being careful to stir 
constantly. 

84. Barley Soup for Invalids. Fine pearl barley is 
cooked in a little boiling water with a small piece of 



48 B— Soups. 

fresh butter, frequently replenishing the water, until the 
barley is tender and of the proper" consistency. It will 
improve the barley if it is to be used in the sick-room to 
first scald it several times. After it is cooked, season 
with salt, finely chopped parsley or nutmeg; the latter 
is preferable when there is stomach trouble. 

Sweet Barley Broth is made by stirring into the 
broth through a fine sieve, the barley which has first 
been cooked until tender, add to the soup thus thick- 
ened salt and sugar, and stir into it the yolk of an egg. 
Barley broth made in this manner is excellent in cases 
of dysentery and diarrhoea. 

85. Oatmeal Soup for Invalids. Fresh oatmeal is 
rinsed in hot and cold water alternately until the water 
remains clear, then cook the oatmeal 1 hour with a 
pinch of salt and 2 tablespoonfuls of fresh almonds, 
either pounded finely or grated, together with the neces- 
sary quantity of water, pass through a sieve and put in 
some sugar and toast. 

86. Toast Soup for Invalids. Very finely pounded 
toast is cooked with water and the juice of 1 lemon, 
until it no longer sinks, add sugar and a trifle of salt, 
and if permitted by the physician, stir in the yolk of 
an egg. 

87. Bread Soup for Invalids. Take rye bread and 
wheat bread half and half, and thoroughly cook in 
water, stir through a fine sieve and cook again with 
some salt, sugar, lemon juice and "either currants or 
raisins until the latter are soft, and, if permitted by the 
physician, stir into it a little wine and the yolk of 
an egg. 

88. Another Bread Soup for Invalids is made by 
taking rye bread only; grating it and then browning in 
a frying pari without any fat until dry, pour on.enough 
water to make a thick pulp and let it stand for an hour 
on the back part of the stove, then stir the pulp with 
hot milk until it is smooth, add sugar and salt and the 
yolk of an egg. As a matter of precaution it will be well 
to stir this soup through a fine-sieve before serving. 



Fruit Soups. 49 

V. FRUIT SOUPS. 

89. Strawberry Soup. Cook some finely pounded 
toast in water until thick, add wine, sug ar and cinna- 
mon, and in case the soup is not of the proper consist- 
ency put in some cornstarch smoothed in water. Then

heaping tablespoonfuls of flour in water until smooth, 
add 3 pints of milk and some salt, put on the fire with 
the plums and cook for a short time, stirring frequently 
until the flour is well cooked. The plums may burst 
but must not become pulpy. If they are entirely ripe no 
sugar need be added. The soup must be nicely bound, 
and is brought to the table when nearly cold. 



95. Prune Soup for Invalids. Wash the prunes, cut 
them up, put them on the fire (with about half the quan- 
tity of oatmeal added) in an earthenware vessel in 
water, with sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and a pinch of 
salt and cook slowly until all is soft. Strain, bring to a 
boil once more and stir up with the yolks of 2 eggs

COLD SOUPS. 



98. Wine Cold Soup. 1 hour before serving put 
into the tureen macaroons or small sweet crackers (if 



Cold Soups. 51 

large, break them into pieces) and add sliced lemon with- 
out the seeds, a few pieces of cinnamon, white wine and 
water half and half, sweetened with sugar. 

99. Orange Cold Soup. Take various fruit syrups, 
wine and water half and half, a few pieces of cinnamon, 
and oranges which are first peeled, divided into 8, parts 
and turned in sugar. The sweet crackers put into this 
soup are first slightly soaked in wine but they must not 
become mushy ; they are then covered with sugar, built 
up in little piles and passed as a side dish. 

100. Apricot Cold Soup. Skin and stone the apri- 
cots and then cook them in water, being careful not to 
get them too soft, together with some of the apricot 
stones, cinnamon' and plenty of sugar ; put one-half of 
this into the tureen and pass the remainder with the 
broth through a fine sieve, and when cool add as much 
wine as water was used in the soup, sweeten with 
plenty of sugar and pour over the apricots. Crackers 
or toast are passed with the soup. 

101. Cherry Cold Soup. Stone a soupplateful of 
sour cherries and cook them for 15 minutes in 1 quart 
of water together with 2—3 cloves and a few of the 
kernels of the cherry pits ; then strain through a fine 
sieve and after it is cold put in 1 pint of claret, plenty of 
sugar and some cinnamon. Sweet crackers can either 
be broken into or passed with the soup. A cream froth 
(see directions under Division N) can be put into the 
soup. 

102. Strawberry and Raspberry Cold Soup. The 
strawberries are first, if necessary, rinsed with water in 
a colander; this is not required with the raspberries. 
Put the berries into the tureen, add plenty of sugar, 
cover tightly and let it stand for 1 hour; then mix 
white, wj ufrand water half and half with sugar, the juice 
of a lemon and ground cinnamon; pour over the ber- 
ries. 

103. Sago or Rice Cold Soup. Scald % of a pound

spoonfuls of sugar, then again brown the whole lightly, 
stirring constantly. After this stir into the buttermilk 
some sweet cream or milk ; shortly before serving crum- 
ble into it crackers or wheat bread and finally strew 
over it the bread after it has cooled. This cold soup is 
very palatable and refreshing. 

107. Whipped Cream. Thick sweet cream is shaken 
to a froth in a shaker or whipped in any convenient 
vessel, but this should be done in the cellar or some 
other cool place. Then stir through it sugar and vanilla 
and serve with crackers and grated rye bread. 

The vanilla can be put into the cream a few hours 
beforehand to draw, or else pound fine with sugar, thus 
requiring less vanilla. 

108. Whipped Sour Cream. For this purpose the 
milk should be thick but its cream must be smooth. 
Whip as directed in the preceding receipt, and stir 
through it sugar and cinnamon.

I. VEGETABLES. 

1. Hints on cooking Vegetables. It is of such fr&. 
quent occurrence that vegetables, which form so import- 
ant and nutritious articles of food, are neglected in 
their preparation and cooking, that a few hints in this 
direction may be found useful and not out of place. 

Cleanliness. Although before alluded to in the in- 
troduction to this book, the necessity of perfect clean- 
liness in respect to the utensils used for cooking and in 
cleaning the vegetables is again brought to your atten- 
tion. But caution should be exercised not to leave 
them lying in water ,t nn lo 11 ^ hppR " RP thereby tne valu- 
able salts t ney contain are extracted; particularly 
tuberous vegetables and celery roots, parsley, etc., 
j should never be soaked in wat er. 

How to economize in using Butter and how to 
rapidly cook Vegetables tender. To obtain a very 
palatable dish of vegetables and to have them done 
without cooking them too long a time, the following 
directions will be found serviceable. When the price of 
butter is unreasonably high, good kidney fat, prepared 
according to A, 17, will be found an excellent substitute 
for creamery butter when cooking most kinds of vege- 
tables, without impairing their flavor. Put thej«fc in 
the water bef or e putting in the vegetabfeB;tgi lTTw : nen~ 
these are taken Jfl'oin Lheiire, merely drop a tew pieces 
of butter over them, which will impart a nice butter 



54 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

flavor and the liquor will become much smoother, xi 
fat from roasts is used, this can also be put into the 
boiling water and some butter mixed through it at the 
last. Lard, go ose grease and mutton fat , , w hich can 
also be prontabiyused as already explained m the first 
part of this book roust, h owever, be put on t he fir e in 
cold water and be cooke d thoroughly b el oretne veere^" 
Tables are put in the "Kettle. ' *" ~~ 

In the meantime, the carefully cleaned and rinsed 
vegetables are put on a colander to drain; j ihe entire^- 
qu antity o f vegetables should not b e th rown into the 
kettle at on e time, b ut, on the contrary? put t hem in 
gr adually with ""tfie slrimmer, but the water must be 
brou gnt *T o"a bbff^acTT^time. In scalding Vegetables 
this meffiod should" als5*be observed, because they will 
then become tender much sooner t han if the cooking is 
delayed by putting in too large a quantity at a time. 
Salt should be added d uring the latter half of the t ime 
takelTfor cooking (except iiFthe case of peasTHSSansr 
etc.) ; strew it over the vegetables uniformly and cover 
tightly and let the cooking go on uninterruptedly. Ke^ 
pjenish ing the jyater should be a vojded- as much as 
possible,; careful attention will soon TJeach one the neces- 
sary quantity needed, but it is always better to take 
rather too little than too much. Always hav e enough 
boiling water handy for replenishing purposes. """ 

Many vegetables must first be scalded on account 
of their strong flavor or perhaps their acrid taste; of 
course, some of their nutritive properties are thereby 
lost in the water. Scalding should, therefore, not be 
resorted to unnecessarily but be minimized as much as 
possible. When scalding vegetables, which require a 
rather long time in cooking before they are tender, for 
instance in the case of vegetables preserved for Winter 
use, water must be used rather plentifully and boiling 
water for replenishing purposes should also be provided 
for, because cold water is not adapted for it. 

' To preserve the fresh color of Vegetables. Spinach, 

green peas, sorrel, Brussels sprouts, etc., should always 

be boiled unoov firflri over a hot fire so that they will 

^become tender rapidly and thus preserve their fresh 

green color. 



Vegetables. 55 

To cook preserved Beans and Cabbages tender rap- 
idly. Vegetables preserved for Winter use— beans and 
cabbage — should be cooked until quite tender and 
freshened in boiling soft water' as long as" is necessary. 
Vegetables in salt or brine become tender very rapidly 
after taking them out of the receptacle in which they 
are contained and cooked without being freshened in 
boiling water. Do not change the water until the vege- 
tables are almost done. 

When Vegetable Dishes should be thickened. Sev- 
eral kinds of vegetables should be thickened with flour 
or the yolks of eggs only when they are almost done. 

Particular care should be taken to cook all vege- 
tables until they are quite tender and juicy, but they 
should never be stirred enough to become pulpy and 
mushy. If Jat and salt are added at the time directed, no 
stirring 1 is necessar y because they are absorbed equally" 
well by the vegetables without stirring. How long a 
time is required for cooking each variety of vegetables 
cannot be designated with any degree of exactness, 
because this depends entirely upon their quantity and 
quality, and also upon the condition of the fire; never- 
theless, the cooking time has been given as approxi- 
mately correct as possible in each receipt. ^Vegetables 
^rown in dry seasons require a longer time on the fire 
f»nd this circumstance should, therefore, always be taken 
i^to account. 

Warmed over Dishes. All varieties of cabbages and 
turnips are also good when warmed over, but it will im- 
prove them to first bring water o r nieat b r , °ffi .'to a b°il 
ajid then putting m tfte vegetables. Do nob neglect to 
add some parsley, salt, T*iljpfln5r HSutter according to 
the variety of the vegetables. If the better kinds of 
vegetables, such as green peas, beans, oyster plant, etc., 
are to be warmed over, follow the above directions, and 
then put them into a double kettle until they are thor- 
oughly heated. 

Serving. Only spinach and similar vegetables are 
smoothed with a knife when they are served. All other 
vegetables should be arranged neatly in the dish in 



56 , U. — Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

which, they come to the table, without pressing them ; 
being careful to wipe off the edges, and have the dish 
warm. 

2. Salsify or Oysterplant. Scrape thoroughly, stir 
a spoonful of flour or some sweet milk in water and lay 
the salsify in this, which will prevent it from turning 
black. Put on the fire in an enameled kettle with meat 
broth and butter and, boil until tender, adding the 
necessary salt, but not too much. 15 minutes before 
serving add grated crackers or browned flour, and 
mace according to taste. Before bringing to the table 
meat dumplings are added to the dish, which is served 
either with boiled beef or without any side dish. 

The salsify can also be boiled in salted water with a 
little vinegar until tender; serve with either a thick 
asparagus or Hollandaise sauce, or else makd a sauce 
from browned flour and butter, meat broth, lemon juice, 
mace and parsley and stew the salsify in this. 

In England the salsify is boiled until tender in salted 
water and then shaken on the fire with butter, grated 
parmesan cheese and ground pepper until the butter 
and cheese are melted ; in South Germany it is usually 
cut into pieces, dipped in a batter and fried in hot lard. 

3. Brussels Sprouts. The sprouts or buds are 
picked when fresh and closed, and the dried leaves and 
hard knots cut from the stalk, being careful not to 
break up the small buds; scald them in boiling water 
with salt, using as little water as possible, take them 
out with a skimmer and put them on a colander to 
drain, covering tightly so that they will remain hot. 
Before serving put them. on a slow fire with a piece of 
butter, salt, nutmeg and a few bread crumbs, and as 
soon as hot turn them in the kettle several times. — 
Brussels sprouts may also be put into the dish, "which 
should of course be warm ; immediately after the water 
has been poured off, put pieces of butter between and 
over the sprouts. 

Time for cooking is a short 15 minutes. 

Smoked or roasted beef tongue, small sausages, cut 
lets, croquets, meat balls, or ham fritters can be served 
as side dishes. 



Vegetables. 67 

4. Spinach. Spinach must be carefully picked over 
and rinsed 3 or 4 times in a deep vessel in plenty of cold 
water. In order to retain its rich green color, scald it 
for about 5 mirm+pp in hniling- wa ter with some salt. 
leaving the kettle uncovered. Ib en put it into cold water _ 
a tpnce, pour it onto a colander, press well with a skim-"" 
mer and chop until very fine. Then melt some kidney 
suet or butter, stir a little flour or some bread crumbs 
with it, put in the spinach, adding nutmeg a nd some 
butter, and cook with frequent stirring until Hone, put- 
ting in as much salt as may be found necessary, and, 
perhaps a small quantity of meat broth or water. 

Some people consider the taste of spinach as being 
rather insipid ; for such it should be seasoned by adding 
a trifle of chives, or onions fried in butter. 

Spinach can be garnished in various wavs; the 
simplest is to take bits of toasted bread and medium 
soft boiled eggs, quartered. A richer method is to first 
put on a border of baked crullers which have been 
formed in a thick mass, bv means oi melted butter a nd 
_cheese ; then inside of the border cover with "plain iried 
eggT-P; each one surrounded by a ring of finely chopped 
cooked tongue. Serve small roasted potatoes as a side 
dish. 

Omelets, croquets, fricandeaus, small sausages, roast 
or smoked beef tongue, kidney slices, crullers With a 
ham forcemeat or fried liver are all good side dishes 
with spinach. 

5. Spinach, Saxony Style. Cook the spinach in salt 
water with an onion, chop it up with a boned anchovy 
very fine, brown some flour in melted butter, stir in as 
much meat broth as is necessary, then cook the spinach 
until well done and garnish with eggs. 

6. Spinach, French Style. Cook the spinach as 
above directed and chop very fine. Stir some butter to 
a froth, add the finely grated yolks of hard boiled eggs, 
some nutmeg and salt., a nd stir all of this with the 
spinach on th"e4r! ! e7untiUt begins to boil. 

Spinach prepared in this manner is greatly im- 
proved by the addition of a few spoonfuls of dark meat 
broth. F ried sliced sweetbreads are served as a side 
"oism 



58 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

7. Spinach with Rice. Scald about % pound of rice 
in water several times, then boil it in milk or weak meat 
broth until soft and stir into it 3 whipped eggs and a 
few spoonfuls of sour cream. Four quarts of spinach 
are cooked in the meantime according to the directions 
previously given, chopped very fine and allowed to sim- 
mer in melted butter ; then season with ground pepper 
audi grated cheese and mix with it a few spoonfuls of 
grated wheat bread. The rice and spinach are separ- 
ately pressed into a buttered mould, afterwards bake 
for 30 minutes, turn out of the cups, pour over it a 
dark meat broth and serve with roast spring chicken or 
veal cutlets. 

8. Moulded Spinach. Spinach left over from the 
table is mixed with the yolks of 2 eggs, several spoon- 
fuls of white gravy, grated wheat bread and a few finely 
chopped stewed mushrooms; mould the mass in small 
cups which have first been buttered, cook in a double 
kettle for % hour, turn out of the cups and serve with 
roast potatoes and baked ham. 

9. Spinach Stalks cooked as a Vegetable. After the 
spinach has run to seed and is no longer good for cook- 
ing purposes, the stalks should be stripped, cut up, cook 
them until soft, soak, press tightly and simmer slowly 
the same as cauliflower (see No. 38). 

Time of cooking, 1 hour. 

10. Dandelions. In the Spring of the year the dan- 
delion grows as a weed on many lawns and fields ; when 
young and tender it makes a very palatable dish, if 
cooked in the same manner as directed for spinach. 

11. Sorrel. Strip the large fresh leaves from the 
stems. Then rinse the leaves in plenty of water several 
times until perfectly free from sandy particles. Put on 
the stove in cold water and throw on a colander just 
before it begins to cook,- otherwise it is apt to become 
too soft. After the acid has been absorbed by the cold 
water and the sorrel has been well drained and pressed 
out with the skimmer on the colander, lightly brown 
butter and some flour and add a few cupfuls of sweet 
cream or milk into which the yolks of 1 — 2 eggs have 
been stirred, also salt and nutmeg, and cook the sorrel 



Vegetables. 59 

in this thoroughly. The broth should be scant and of a 
nice consistency and not watery. Garnish with bits of 
toasted bread. Time of cooking, % hour. 

Side-dishes: cutlets, tongue, smoked meats, boiled 
ham, liver, kidney slices, fish omelets, roast or stewed 
lamb. 

12. Endives. Bleached endive leaves are among 
the nicest winter vegetables. Cut away the stalks and 
green leaves and boil the inner yellow leaves in salted 
wa ter, cool in colcfft ajre rr press them out and chop"fEe~m~ 
fine! Then stew for ~% hour in a strong meat broth 
which has been thickened with lightly browned flour. 
Season with n utmeg, put in a little l emon juice* and if 
desired, the yolks of a" few eggs may bestirred info it. 

The endives can be stewed in a cream sauce instead 
of the meat broth, or else after having been prepared 
according to either one of the described methods, pass 
through a sieve, stir with butter and serve as a puree. 
Serve with cutlets of all kinds, fried liver, meat balls, 
sweetbreads or spring chicken. 

13. Greens from Stems and Stalks of Turnips and 
Beet Tops. Strip off the leaves (when quite young the 
stalks can be prepared unstripped) wash and cut the 
stems and cook in slightly salted water until tender. 
After draining cut the stalks very finely, brown some 
flour in butter very lightly, cook this either in milk or 
the broth of pickled meat, stew in it the greens until 
done and season with nutmeg. If the broth from pickled 
meat is used it should be first examined to see that it is 
not too salty. 

Serve with cutlets, scallops,. meat balls, boiled or 
raw ham and kidney slices. 

14. Greens as above for the Family Table. First 
boil a piece of smoked bacon or fat pork for an hour, 
put some potatoes in the broth and then add the meat 
and the greens which have been cooked until tender and 
are well drained, salt and cook thoroughly until done. 
Then take out the meat and stir into the greens, accord- 
ing to quantity, 1 to 3 grated raw potatoes; this thick- 
ens the dish nicely and gives it a bright appearance, 
but it must not be cooked long enough to become dry. 



60 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

Instead of cooking meat in the greens, sliced smoked 
bacon may be slightly fried on a slow fire, then take 
some of its fat and add to the greens^ and serve the 
bacon separately. This is not only economical, but is 
preferred by a great many. 

15. Asparagus. Scrape the coarse skin from each 
blade and cut from the bottom as much as is hard. A 
better way still is as follows : slit the outer skin from 
the bottom upwards and take it off at once; a^ little 
practice will enable one to do this rapidly. Then wash 
the asparagus, tie into bunches, making the tips even 
and cutting the lower ends all of one length. , . .Cook with 
a little'saJt in not too much water, which should, boil 
iao ^eraTeiy, o therwise ihe tips' wilt become too soft. " 
The~aa"ditTon-to the saltwater of a pinch of sugar a nd a 
.piece of b utter t he size of a hazelnut gives the asparagus 
a very delicious taste. As soon as the lower ends be- 
come tender (the usual time for tips is % of an hour and 
for the whole blade % hour) put the bunches on a heated, 
platter, cut the bands and serve. 

Serve with either an asparagus sauce (see under E) 
or pass with it melted butter ; frequently the grated 
yolks of hard boiled eggs accompany the butter. 

In South Germany cream sauces are preferred; in 
England the asparagus is placed on large pieces of 
toast, and melted butter, into which the yolks of 3 eggs 
have been stirred, is poured over it; sometimes parme- 
sau cheese is grated over it, and fried eggs laid on top. 
Appropriate side dishes are cutlets, roast poultry, meat 
balls, scrambled eggs, raw ham and smoked salmon. ' 

It should be noted that asparagus must never be 
permitted to lay in water. 

16. Stewed Asparagus. Scrape or peel the aspara- 
gus, cut into pieces, lay aside the tips and cook the rest 
until half done, because these pieces sometimes have a 
slightly bitter taste; then bring meat broth with a 
good sized piece of butter, a trifle of mace and some 
salt to a boil ; put into this all of the asparagus pieces 
and let it simmer slowly until soft. Shortly before serv- 
ing add some crushed toast and stir into the broth the 
yolks of a few eggs. Serve neatly, garnishing with 
bread dumplings and pour the thick broth over all. 



Vegetables. 61 

Side dishes the same as above, with the exception of 
scrambled eggs. 

a- . Tn ® as P ara gus tips prepared alone make a very nice 
dish. Cook them until soft in a scant meat broth with 
the addition of salt and some butter. In the meantime 
prepare a cream sauce and have it ready so that the 
broth m which the tips are being cooked need only be 
brought to a boil, when the tips are placed on a warm 
platter and set over a vessel containing hot water. 
Then immediately pour over the sauce; garnish with 
medium soft boiled whole eggs, and serve with pickled 
tongue. 

17. Asparagus with young Carrots. Take a quan- 
tity of young carrots, rub them in salt, wash and scrape 
them until clean and cut into 2 or 3 pieces; cook the 
carrots with the same quantity of asparagus according 
to the preceding receipt and serve in the same manner 
without the yolks of eggs. 

18. Imperial (Kaiser) Asparagus. Cook the aspara- 
gus until tender as directed in No. 15, then whip in 1 
pint of JjtfiinemnaJh£yolks of 8 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls 
of butter, a little salt and a pinch of sugar in a double 
kettle to a thick sauce, serve the asparagus on a hot 
platter with this sauce poured over it. 

19. Asparagus in Rusks, (an elegant Entree). Peel 
the asparagus, take the tips only, cook in halted water 
until done. Make a thick sauce from veal broth thick- 
ened with lightly browned flour and butter, adding 
some finely chopped parsley; the tips are heated in this 
and then stir them with the yolks of a few eggs beaten 
up with cream. \ Soak smajl rusks after removing the 
crust, hollow them out and fill with the asparagus, tie 
the crusts over them as a cover and toast in butter un- 
til nicely browned. The ends of the asparagus together 
with the broth and some extract of beef will make an 
excellent soup. 

20. Leipzig Hotch Potch. This dish is the most 
palatable during the asparagus season. Take the fol- 
lowing early vegetables in equal quantities and cook 
each kind separately until done: asparagus in water 
with some salt, small carrots in beef broth, shelled 



62 C. — Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

green peas in water with a small piece of butter, kohl- 
rabi in water with a little salt/and cauliflower the same 
as kohlrabi. As soon as everything is thoroughly 
cooked, put it all into the dish carefully, placing the 
cauliflower on top, and mix through all the claws and 
tails of crabs. The shells of the crabs are filled with 
force meat made from the meat of the crabs and pie- 
crust dough. While preparations for serving are going 
on, place the vegetables over a steaming vessel, and 
then drench with a butter* sauce made from cream and 
crab butter half and half, stirring into it the yolks of 
eggs. Garnish with the stuffed crab shells and little 
bread dumplings. 

21. Early Carrots, Early carrots are scraped very 
lightly, and if quite young simply rub with a coarse 
towel ; they are left whole and nicely rinsed but not laid 
into the water. Then cook them in boiling water with 
some sugar, butter and a very little salt (they can 
easily be oversalted) in a scant broth until done. Be- 
fore serving dredge over them X teaspoonful of flour 
and put in some finely chopped parsley leaves. 

The carrots can also first be stewed for about 10 
minutes in butter, shaking them, then add some sugar, 
a small bunch of parsley, salt and a little lightly 
browned flour and butter, simmer slowly until tender, 
and serve after taking out the parsley. Sometimes an 
onion is also • added, but this is objectionable to people 
with delicat'e palates. 

Time of cooking, 1 hour. Serve with cutlets of var- 
ious kinds, baked meat balls, fried pork sausages, 
smoked and salted tongue. 

22. Young Carrots and Peas. Put the carrots on 
the fire as above directed in boiling water with some 
butter. Then add the shelled peas, take half of each 
kind of vegetable and proceed as directed above. 
Shortly before serving a few bread dumplings may be 
added, but in this case more broth (which can be thick- 
ened with a little cornstarch) must be provided for. 

23. Green Peas. Put plenty of butter in water^and 
let it boil, throw in the shelled peas gradually, keeping 
the broth boiling. Peas must cook in plenty of broth 
rapidly ; cooking them too slowly or for too long time, 



VEGETABLES. 63 

or letting them stand too long when done greatly im- 
pairs their flavor. Shortly before serving add some 
salt but not too much, because they are easily over- 
salted, and, if they are not sweet enough, put in a small 
lump of sugar. Stir into them finely chopped parsley, 
and cornstarch or flour smoothed in water (a quarter 
of a teaspoonful at a time). Or instead of this, knead 
flour and butter into a small dumpling and put this 
with the peas as soon as they begin to boil ; it dissolves 
gradually, thickens the broth somewhat and imparts a 
pleasant flavor to the peas. If there is abundant broth, 
little sponge or bread dumplings can be cooked with it 
at the last. The preparation of dumplings is described 
under Division 0. 

Peas can also be cooked as directed in the second 
receipt for carrots, or, after boiling them in salt water, 
they may be stewed in a cream sauce or else drench in 
butter and scatter chopped parsley over them. — For a 
particularly fine dish the peas may be garnished with 
the tails of crabs or stuffed crab shells. 

Peas are served with roast spring chicken, veal cut- 
lets, croquettes, raw ham, hot or cold tongue, smoked 
salmon, fried eels and other crisply fried fish. 

Remark. — To retain the fine aromatic flavor of the peas they must be freshly 
picked, and in no case should they be shelled sooner than shortly before wanted 
for cooking. m ~ m -" " ~"~ — ' » .w ^ ii**"*-—- *— » **--~^...— w^ 1 ww IMW - WM ^^ , w — w w — 



24. Green Peas boiled with Spring Chicken and 
Crabs. Cook the chicken in salt water until all the scum 
has been taken off, then put in a piece of butter and 
cook slowly until tender. As soon as the broth is 
strong enough, put a large piece of butter into another 
kettle, put in the shelled peas, cover and let them sim- 
mer for a while, stirring them occasionally. Then fill 
up with part of the chicken broth, cook the peas until 
tender, stir through it some finely chopped parsley, and 
thicken the broth with a few egg yolks, whipped with a 
tablespoonful of water. Have ready some crabs with 
dressing and some crab butter, as directed under A, 
No. 37, and No. 9, also a lot of wheat bread dumplings. 
Carve the chicken nicely, plae&in the center Of the dish, 
surrounded by the peas, then put in the dumplings and 
filled crabs, put in between then) the claws and tails and

pour over the whole the crab butter; Serve as an 
entree. 

Time of cooking is the same as given for preceding 
vegetables. 

25. Green Peas with Codfish (a favorite dish in 
Saxony). Cook the peas in a meat broth and butter 
until tender, then add some lightly browned flour and 
butter and sufficient salt; the codfish, together with 
some chopped parsley is then stirred through the broth, 
which must not be too plentiful, because the addition of 
the codfish in itself increases the quantity of broth. The 
codfish should be prepared in advance early enough as 
directed for cooking fish in another part of the book, 
take off the skin, bone and pick into small pieces, stir 
in plenty of melted butter, put on the stove, but do not 
allow it to stew or simmer, and then mix it through the 



26. Sweet Peas. The small variety is the best, 
those with long pods are not so nice. Sweet peas need 
not be shelled, simply spring them carefully and wash 
thoroughly, cook in boiling water with butter and salt 
and finally stir through them some chopped parsley 
and some cornstarch smoothed in water. Time of cook- 
ing, from 1 to 1% hours. 

. Smoked meats, fried sausages, fried liver, baked fish, 
etc., are served with the peas. 

27. Mixed Vegetables for a Dinner Party. Quarter 
pigeons or spring chickens, boil in salt water until free 
from scum, then add some butter, mace and some nicely 
browned flour and cook slowly. In the meantime care- 
fully peel plenty of asparagus and cauliflower and cut 
into pieces; both are then cooked in salt water until 
half done. Pour the vegetables on a sieve to drain and 
then put in with the pigeons and cook until completely 
done. Be careful to keep the pieces whole. After this 
cook a lot of crabs in boiling water for 15 minutes, pick 
the meat from the shells and prepare crab butter from 
the shells of the claws and the tails, according to A, 
No. 9. Lay the crab tails aside; the meat picked from 
the claws is chopped fine with butter, a small quantity 
of wheat bread crumbs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream ', 1 egg, 
some nutmeg and salt, and made into forcemeat ; stuff 
a few of the crab shells with the forcemeat and cook

them together with little meat or wheat bread dumplings 
in meat broth until done. Put the fowls with the vege- 
tables into the dish. Stir the yolks of a few eggs into 
the sauce, add a little lemon juice, the tails of the crabs 
and some dumplings, garnish with the stuffed, crab 
shells and put the crab butter over all. 

This dish is excellent without the crabs, which, while 
adding to its elegance, cause some trouble in its pre- 
paration. It will take fully two hours to prepare this 

28. Early Turnips. It is best to cut the turnips 
into either large cubes or into narrow slices; they are 
occasionally bitter, and should therefore be scalded in 
boiling water; then put them on the fire in boiling meat 
broth or, with fat, in water, observing 1 that this vege- 
table in itself contains a large percentage of water and 
consequently needs but a small addition of it, cook until 
tender, putting in the salt later on, then add J£ to % tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch smoothed in water or sprinkle 
some flour into the broth from the side and put a few 
pieces of butter on top ; if meat broth is not used put in 
)i of a teaspoonf ul of extract of beef. After the turnips 
are served, grate nutmeg over them and serve boiled 
potatoes as a side dish. 

The potatoes can also be cooked with the turnips 
and should be put into the kettle with the turnips when 
the latter are half done. 

Pork or mutton chops and fried sausages are served 
with the turnips. 

29. Early Turnips with flutton. The mutton is 
either cut into cubes as for a stew, or else washed off 
whole and boiled in not too much salted water until the 
scum ceases to rise. After cooking for an hour pass the 
broth through a sieve, clean the kettle and bring the 
broth with the meat to a boil again. Then the meat 
can be either cooked in the broth until entirely done 
and the turnips also without being scalded if quite 
sweet, but if bitter, scald them and then cook until done 
with some of the mutton broth, putting in a few small 
potatoes at once if desired, or the turnips maybe boiled 
together with the mutton. 

Tim&of cooking the mutton is from 1% to 2% hours. 



66 C— Potatoes ahs other vegetables. 

30. Mixed Vegetables with Mutton, English style. 

Take a tender breast of mutton and cut it in cubes as 
for a ragout, rinse thoroughly and boil, until scum no 
longer appears, in sufficient salt water to cook the vege- 
tables. In the meantime slice string beans into small 
pieces, cut up savoy cabbage into pieces the size of half 
an egg, and carrots into cubes after they have been well 
washed and cleaned. After again carefully rinsing the 
latter, they are put into the kettle with the mutton, the 
first two kinds of vegetables, however, are previously 
boiled for a short time and then also put in with the 
mutton; add what salt may still be needed and some 
pepper; cover the kettle and cook until all is tender, 
nicely bound and juicy, but the vegetables must not be 
cooked to a pulp. 

31. Spanish mixed Vegetables or Hotch Potch. Very 
palatable and nutritious. Cover a stewpan with slices 
of fat pork, cut equal parts of lamb and beef into cubes, 
kohlrabi into slices and separate the leaves of a savoy 
cabbage. Fill the kettle with the meat and vegetables in 
alternate layers, sprinkling salt and pepper on each 
layer. Put in some butter and pour a cupful of meat 
broth over all. Put on top a few small smoked sausages, 
cover the stewpan as tightly as possible and then let it 
cook slowly until done, which will take all of two hours. 
Serve neatly,' garnishing with peeled roast potatoes 
placed around the edge of the dish, and cuttingthe saus- 
ages into slices and laying them on top. 

32. String Beans. Take beans that are tender but 
not too young, and wash them nicely. Cook the beans 
in plenty of boiling water, putting in the beans gradu- 
ally as directed under No. 1 of this division; or else cook 
them over a quick fire in an uncovered kettle until quite 
tender in milk and water half and half, skimming care- 
fully. Salt is added when the beans are about half 
done but not before. After they are quite tender pour 
them into an earthenware colander (tinware will give 
the beans a bad color), pour boiling water over them 
and cover quickly; they thereby retain their natural 
color, but be careful that they remain nicely hot. Be- 
fore serving stir lightly with plenty of butter and pars- 
ley, or else pour hot melted butter with parsley over the 



Vegetables. 67 

dish when bringing it to the table. Time of cooking, 
1 hour. 

■Serve with either boiled ham, spare ribs or bacon. 

33. Another riethod. Cut some bacon into cubes, 
fry slowly, and lightly brown some flour in it. Then 
stir with boiling water, a small piece of butter and salt ; 
the beans which have first been boiled until tender and 
drained are then rapidly stewed until done, together 
with some chopped parsley or savory, care being taken 
that they do not become pulpy or stirred to pieces. 
Sliced pork can be lightly fried (see No. 14), stir the fat 
through the beans and lay the slices on the top. 

Or, cook a piece of lean pork, take off the fat, heat it 
in another vessel until boiling hot, lightly brown a little 
flour in it, stir into it some of the pork broth, cook the 
beans in this as above directed and serve with the 
pork. 

If the beans are old and have tough skins, they 
should first be cooked until half done, when they can be 
hulled ; afterwards cook them as above directed. 

34. Stewed Lettuce. Pick the heads over carefully 
and wash very thoroughly. Cook in plenty of boiling 
water, putting in a little cooking soda, pour on a col- 
ander then let it stand fo r about 1 hour in waterT xT 
extract any bitterness there may be inTnTTlettuce, press 
out and chop finely. Brown a little flour, grated toast 
or crackers in good fat, and add to this the lettuce, to- 
gether with some boiling water, a small piece of butter, 
salt and nutmeg and then stew until done. 

Another way is to take young lettuce and boil until 
tender, press it but, do not chop it but stew with milk 
and then proceed as directed in No. 14. Serve with veal 
meat balls, fried liver, cutlets, kidneys, baked fish, meat 
omelets, etc. 

35. Vegetables with Barley Groats for the Family 
Table. Cut up several kohlrabi, together with parsley, 
celery and other roots, string beans and sliced onions, 
put on the fire with some water and soup fat, salt, sea- 
son with spices and cook until half done. Then cook in 
this broth with the vegetables barley groats which have 
first been scalded and simmered until half done. When 
everything is thoroughly cooked stir through jt fried

pork cut into little cubes, and serve with poached eggs 
put on the dish, smoked bacon, spare ribs, beef roasted 
in a kettle. 

36. Kohlrabi. After washing and peeling, cut them 
into fine slices or pieces, being careful to remove every- 
thing that is tough or hard, and then cook in boiling 
water until tender. Brown some flour in kidney fat or 
butter, add either fresh milk or meat broth according 
to taste, and also nutmeg and salt as desired, in which 
the kohlrabi is to be stewed. If the kohlrabi is quite 
young and tender, the small inner leaves are chopped 
quite fine, cooked in a separate vessel, butter and meat 
broth stirred through them and then used to garnish a 
dish of kohlrabi that has been stewed like cauliflowers. 
If the leaves are not tender enough for this purpose, 
then sliced sweetbreads or little pork sausages can be 
used to garnish, or else serve with cutlets, meat balls or 
steak. 

Time of cooking, 1% hours. 

Remark.— The blue iohlrabi is preferable to the white because it is milder 
ana does not become tough so easily as the other kind. 

37. Filled Kohlrabi (as an Entremet). Peel the 
kohlrabi nice and round, and cook until partly done in 
weak salt water. Cut a slice from the end, hollow out 
the kohlrabi in cupform, fill with a good veal forcemeat, 
close by tieing on the slice that has been cut from the 
end, and then put them into a low kettle with the cov- 
ered ends to the top, adding boiling meat broth, agood 
sized piece of butter and salt if necessary; then cook 
until done. , 

When serving put them on the dish with care, cut- 
ting the threads with which the covers were tied, stir 
some cornstarch into the broth and pour it over the 
kohlrabi. About 2 hours time will be necessary for the 
preparation of this dish. 

38. Cauliflowers. Trim the stalk carefully, cut the 
smaller leaves away with a sharp-pointed knife, leaving, 
the flowers whole; then lay into salt water which will 
expel any insects that may lurk in the vegetable. Cook 
slowly in not too much boiling water with salt, a piece 
of butter, and lemon juice until tender — but not soft — 



Vegetables. 69 

and in order to prevent its not going to pieces lift it 
out with a clean napkin, put it carefully on a colander, 
drain well and cover immediately. Put it in -a round 
dish with the flower to the top. 

In Germany it is customary to pour over it a thick 
crab sauce ? a cream- or a tart egg sauce; the English 
style is to simply pour over it melted butter and cover 
it with grated bread crumbs with a little grated nut- 
meg. 

Serve with small sausages, beef tongue, raw ham, 
roast spring chicken, stuffed breast of veal, smoked sal- 
mon, forcemeat balls, meat fritters, kidney croquettes 
or pork sausages. 

Time of cooking, 1% hours. 

39. Cauliflowers with Parmesan Cheese. After 
cooking the cauliflowers set them into the proper dish, 
pour over them a thick cream sauce into which has 
been stirred a handful of Parmesan cheese, and after- 
wards cover it with grated Parmesan cheese. Pour 
over it melted butter and then bake in the same dish in 
a moderately hot oven until it receives a rich color. 

In some kitchens broccoli, wh ich is a species of cauli- 
llowjej^Jis quite frequently cooked in its stead; The pre- 
paration of the- flowers of this vegetable, which are 
separated into single pieces, is_ the same as with cauli- 
flowers. The stalk of the broccoli can be peeled, cut 
into pieces, and cooked like asparagus, and it tastes 
quite similar to the latter. 

40. Artichokes. Cut the stalks close, remove the 
hard leaves, and trim off the sharp points from the 
remaining leaves with a pair of scissors. After they 
have boiled for two or three hours in salted water, take 
out the fibres, cut off the bottom clear to the white of 
the artichoke and serve hot with Hollandaise sauce 
(Division E) . In the winter artichokes filled with sweet 
peas (canned) are a favorite dish for genteel dinner 
parties. 

Serve with the same dishes indicated for cauliflowers. 

41. Egg Plant. Of this vegetable those shaped like 
a cucumber and of a violet color, and the white kind s 
are considered the best, bu t both varieties must be 



70 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

thoroughly ripe, otherwise they are quite apt to have a 
bitter taste. 

To cook them first cut into halves the long way, 
make a few incisions into the pieces,turn them in bread 
crumbs, melted butter, pepper and salt, and then brown 
slightly in the frying pan. Or else cut into slices, sea- 
son with salt and a little pepper, brown lightly with 
butter in a frying pan and serve with tomato sauce. If 
the egg plants are pickled for a few hours in vinegar, 
salt and water, .they can be made into a very appetizing 
salad by the addition of either eggs, cresses, etc., with 
vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper. 

42. Butter Beans. String carefully, wash and put 
them into boiling water gradually. Put in the salt 
when the beans are more than half done, then cook 
until quite tender and put them on an earthenware col- 
ander to drain. Serve with an egg- or butter sauce (see 
Division E) . Time of cooking, IJ4 to 1% hours. 

Fresh herring, raw or boiled ham, pork chops, escal- 
lops, sausages, fried meat balls are usually served with 
this vegetable. 

43. Another method of cooking Butter Beans. Clean 
and string the beans as usual, but instead of slicing 
them break into little pieces about 1 inch long. Then 
brown a little flour in hot kidney suet, stir with milk so 
that the beans can be cooked in it, add whatever salt is 
necessary and also some pepper. Cook the beans for a 
short time in this sauce and then take from the fire. 
Stir through the beans enough vinegar to give them a 
tart flavor, doing this carefully so that they will not 
mash, and serve with potatoes. Or when boiled the 
beans can be dressed simply with fresh butter and 
chopped parsley. 

44. Sliced Beans. As sliced beans receive no preli- 
minary scalding, they should be well washed after 
stringing; then cut them into thin long slices and cook 
in boiling water with a little butter, an onion, and a 
small piece of ham ; afterwards take out the ham and 
onion, stir in some browned flour and add a teaspoon- 
ful of pulverized sugar, finely chopped parsley and, if 
necessary, some salt. 

Time of cooking, about two hours. Serve with the 
same dishes indicated for butter beans. 



Vegetables. 71 

45. Sliced Beans with Milk. Prepare the beans as 
already directed, scald in boiling water, drain, add milk, 
salt and butter, and cook until tender ; before serving 
put in finely chopped parsley and peppergrass, also 
flour stirred in cream, 1 tablespoonful to a large cupful; 
stir through the beans and cook until done. 

46. Savoy Cabbage. Bemove the outer leaves, cut 
the head in two, take out the heart and the coarse ribs 
and cut the rest into small pieces, wash these nicJy, 
cook in plenty of boiling water with not too much salt 
on a hot fire until done ; put on a colander, drench with 
boiling water, press, and stew with meat broth, nutmeg 
and butter. 

Time of cooking, 1 hour. Serve with roast duck, 
roast beef, cutlets, pork sausages, kettle roast of beef, 
or, for the family table, a nice piece of soup meat. 

47. Duck in Savoy Cabbage. Cut the cabbage into 
2 or 4 pieces, according to the size of the heads ; remove 
the coarse ribs, taking care to leave the pieces whole; 
then wash and drain on a colander. In the meantime 
prepare a duck as directed under VII, Division D, salt 
.slightly, roast it in butter to a light brown, lay a few 
slices of fat pork under it, and put 2 cupfuls of water 
and the cabbage to the duck, being careful that the cab- 
bage pieces remain whole; put some salt between the 
layers, cover the kettle and let it simmer on a slow fire 
about 1%— 2 hours. 

In serving put the duck in the middle of the dish 
and place the cabbage around it. If it is not desired to 
cook the duck with the cabbage, the latter can be pre- 
pared with the gravy of the roast duck, which is served 
separately with it. 

48. Red Cabbage (Kappes). Red summer cabbage 
is preferable to winter oah bafe because the latterh as a 
stro nger Havpr and takes twice as much time in_co ok-„ 
TngrTirst cut the head in two ln^fh^TnltJmeTremove 
the coarse outer leaves and thickest ribs, and then cut

possible. The cabbage will be better if it i s fi r st scalded; 
after draining , put in e nough vinegar' so tEaTfrb will

butter and kidney suet half and half, and then add some 
sweet grapes, 2 sour apples cut into pieces, a number of 
small onions, a little sugar and salt, and in this cook 
the cabbage until tender. Shortly before serving, dredge 
a little flour over it, add a glassful of claret and accord- 
ing to taste, a few spoonfuls of currant juice, stew a few 
quartered apples on top of the cabbage until soft, garn- 
ish with these and serve. 

Cabbage prepared in this way does riot need the 
addition of any vinegar, it is tart enough without and 
more wholesome than if it had received a stronger.sea- 
soning with vinegar. Small roast potatoes are served 
with the cabbage, but boiled potatoes will also answer 
if the time is sho,rt. 

White cabbage can also be prepared in the same 
manner, but instead of the claret take white wine and 
leave out the apples ; some prefer a rather tart flavor 
to white cabbage which can be obtained by adding a 
little vinegar and lemon juice. Serve with filet of beef, 
roast beef, tongue, meat balls, fried sausages, roast 
pork, hare, goose or duck, sour beef, roast or stuffed 
spare ribs. 

49. White Cabbage. After removing the outer green 
leaves of the cabbage, cut it in two in the center. Take 
out the core and the coarse ribs and then cut up into 
large pieces; cook in plenty of boiling water on a hot 
fire for 10, but not more than 15 minutes, leaving the 
kettle uncovered, put on a colander to drain, bring 
salted water to a boil, add some kidney fat or fat from 
roast meats, put in the cabbage with a few pieces of 
butter, cover tightly and let it simmer until very tender. 
It does not need any stirring because the fat and salt 
are absorbed equally well by the cabbage, and after it 
is done it is taken out with the skimmer and placed in 
the dish. Cabbage cooked in this manner is very palat- 
able and looks nice. Potatoes can either be brought to 
the table separately or else be cooked with the cabbage; 
in the latter case put them on the cabbage after it has 
cooked about 15 minutes, and put a little salt and a 
few pieces of butter on the potatoes instead of the cab- 
bage. The meat intended to go with cabbage— beef, 
lamb or lean pork are the most appropriate — may be

boiled in water for about 1 hour beforehand, lay the 
cabbage on the meat and then cook as above directed. 
Serve with stewed beef, soup meat, meat balls, spare 
ribs, fried sausages and the like. 

50. Hunter's Cabbage (Jaeger-Kohl). Shred white 
cabbage the same as red cabbage and make a thick 
tart bacon sauce (see Division K), season with pepper, 
taking for the sauce about 1 ounce of fat pork and a 
heaping teaspoonful of fine flour for each person. Put 
nicely washed potatoes on the fire in a medium sized 
kettle with some salt; they should not be entirely 
covered with water. After the potatoes begin to cook, 
put in the cabbage evenly, a little higher around the 
edges, add whatever salt may still be necessary, pour 
the sauce over the cabbage, cover tightly and cook until 
the potatoes are thought to be entirely done. Lift the 
cover and, if, after the potatoes are done there is too 
much broth, then uncover the kettle and boil away the 
broth over a hot fire. Finally a good stirring must be 
given the cabbage which should be of a nice consistency, 
quite juicy and taste pleasantly tart. 

Serve immediately with fried sausages. 

51 . White Cabbage with flutton (Hecklenburg Style). 

Cut the mutton into small squares, wash nicely, salt 
dad cook 1 — 1% hours. In the meantime remove the 
outer leaves and the stalk of the cabbage, quarter, boil 
about 15 minutes and drain. Cover the bottom of the 
kettle with thin slices of fat pork, put on a layer of cab- 
bage, then a few pieces of meat, sprinkle with salt and 
chopped onions, chervil, ground pepper and a few cloves, 
put on another layer of cabbage and meat and proceed 
in this manner, finishing with a layer of cabbage on top, 
pour in the mutton broth (which should be free from 
settlings) and cook for an hour to a rather thick con- 
sistency. When serving, turn out of the kettle and 
remove the slices of pork from the bottom before bring- 
ing to the table. 

52. Stuffed Cabbage. Take plenty of large cabbage 
or savoy leaves, boil them for about' 10 minutes, put 
a napkin into a colander and place in it the leaves (after 
removing th e co arse ribs) evenly and thick all around. 
Spread over theirf forcemeat No. 23, A, put on another

layer of leaves and proceed in this manner until arather 
good sizedLhead has been formed. Then gather the ends 
of the napkin, tie with a string and cook until done in 
meat stock or slightly salted water with which it should 
be barely covered, keeping the" kettle tightly closed. 
When ready to serve, take the cabbage out of the nap- 
kin carefully and putit on a dish. Make a sauce of plenty 
of butter browned with flour stirred with some of the 
cabbage broth; season with extract of beef, mace and 
lemon peel and stir into it the yolks of a few eggs. Part 
of this sauce should be poured over the cabbage and 
the remainder passed at the table. This dish must 900J&. 
full y 2 hours an d is served with potatoes only, witEno 
oEtfer-side dish. 

53. Filled Cabbage in another Style. Take a few 
white cabbages, cut away the outer leaves, remove the 
coarse ribs and also the heart or core. "Wash the cab- 
bages and cook in slightly salted boiling water until 
almost done. Drain, and after it is cool put it length- 
wise into a pudding mould or perhaps into a narrow 
cooking vessel, in which case a cupful of beef broth 
should be poured over it, together with a pork force- 
meat which is made as described further on, and then 
cook slowly. When put into the pudding mould in lay- 
ers, the largest leaves should be placed on the bottom ; 
spread on them the forcemeat about % inch thick and 
continue in thisinanner until the desired quantity has 
been moulded. Finish with cabbage and a few pieces of 
butter on the top. Press- down a little, cover tightly, 
put into boiling water and cook uninterruptedly for 2 
hours. 

The forcemeat is made for a large cabbage by tak- 
ing about V/i pounds of finely chopped pork, about % 
pound of grated wheat bread, 3 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of sour cream, some finely chopped onion, pepper, salt 
and nutmeg. 

The sauce can be made in various ways. The simp- 
lest and most profitable is, to take gravy of roast beef 
or roast veal with some extract of beef, thicken with 
grated wheat bread and add to it previously stewed 
mushrooms. Or else lightly brown grated wheat bread 
in butter; again make a weak broth from cabbage 
leaves and remnants Of meat, use this to thin some 



Vegetables. 75 

flour browned in butter and season according to taste 
with capers, chopped anchovy or mushrooms, and 
strengthen with a trifle of extract of beef. 

54. Stewed Celery. After cleaning the roots, cut 
them into 4—8 pieces, boil until done, take them out 
and stew in a clear meat stock which gives the celery a 
good yellow color, together with butter, salt and nut- 
meg; finally -thicken the broth with some cornstarch. 

Time of cooking, 1% hours. Serve with stuffed 
breast of veal, stewed ribs of veal, beef tenderloin, rolled 
steak, fried sweetbreads, forcemeat balls, roasted beef 
tongue, fried sausages, meat fritters and cutlets of all 
kinds. 

55. Stuffed Celery is prepared in the same manner 
as directed for stuffed kohlrabi, omitting the crab 
butter. 

56. Stewed Onions. Take onions of medium size 
and peel them. Cook until done in an earthenware ves- 
sel in meat broth, with butter, mace, salt and rolled 
crackers. Time of cooking, 1 — 1% hours. Add some 
lemon juice according to taste. 

Serve with escallops, cutlets, roast tongue, fried 
liver and fried sausages. This dish can be served with 
soup meat or used as a garnish for a string bean salad. 

57. Stuffed Giant Onions. Spanish onions, which 
grow to the size of a saucer, are peeled, cut off o ne end 
to be used as a _cover, hollow out, fill w~Mi gboJTforce- 
meat, put on the cover and fasten with a little wooden 
peg or tie with a thread, fcitew the onions for 5 mffl- 
utes in melted butter, add beef broth, some salt, cloves, 
white pepper, 2 — 3 bay leaves, a little mace, some grated 
toast, a nd stew the onions covered tightly in thif lmtiT 
"fEey" aTe done and the forcemeat is thoroughly cooked, 
which will take from %—l hour. Remove the pegs or 
threads and serve the onions in their own sauce with 
lemon slices. 

58. Stewed Cucumbers. Pare, take out the seeds, 
cut the cucumbers into pieces and cook in water and 
vinegar half and half, with salt. A simpler way is to lay 
them in a pickle of water, vinegar and salt for an hour. 



76 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

Then stew them in a meat or beef extract broth with 
butter, nutmeg and rolled crackers. Three-fourths of an 
hour will be sumcent to prepare this dish. Serve with 
meat balls, cutlets, roast mutton, sausages and veal 
escallops. 

59. Stuffed Cucumbers. Take large green cucumb- 
ers and pare them the evening before they are to be 
used, cut them in two lengthwise and lay them in vine- 
gar after taking out the seeds. Towards the noon hour 
dry them and make a veal forcemeat, taking for this 
purpose a small piece of finely chopped veal, chopped 
mushrooms, a rusk which has been soaked in cold water 
and well pressed, a small piece of fresh butter, a whipped 
egg, nutmeg and salt. Mix well, stuff into the halved 
cucumbers, tie them together, put them on the fire in 
plenty of melted butter, brown them nicely all over and 
let them stew slowly until done. After the cucumbers 
have been taken from the fire, brown as much flour in 
the butter which remains in the vessel as is necessary to 
thicken the sauce ; also put in the broth to make the 
sauce, or instead of this, water with the addition of beef 
extract. Furthermore, a lemon slice without the seeds, 
some mace, salt, a pinch of white pepper and capers. 
Stew the cucumbers in this for a short time and after 
removing the threads serve in the sauce stirred with the 
yolk of an egg. 

60. Cooked Cucumbers. This makes a very easily 
digestible dish and while, perhaps, it may be considered 
as being a trifle insipid in taste, yet it is recommended 
because it can be prepared in 15 minutes. Pare the 
cucumbers, which should be of a good size, cut into long 
pieces the thickness of a finger, put into boiling salted 
water and cook for a few minutes ; in the meantime 
brown a teaspoonful of flour in a small piece of butter, 
stir with it some fresh milk, season with nutmeg and 
after draining the cucumbers stew them until done, sim- 
ilar to cauliflowers. 

After the cucumbers have come from the fire, a little 
vinegar can be added if desired. Serve with meat balls, 
roast spring chicken and all kinds of salted and smoked 
meats. 



VEGETABLES. 77 

61. Fresh Mushrooms. The mushrooms should be 
closed as much as possible; cut away the sandy end of 
the stalk, wash them with great care, drain and put 
them on the fire in an earthenware vessel with some 
meat broth and butter; cover tightly and cook slowly 
for 15 minutes. Finally add a teaspoonful of corn- 
starch or some rolled crackers, a little lemon juice, 
pepper and salt and, according to taste, some chopped 
parsley, and cook until the broth has a nice consist- 
ency ; stir the yolk of an egg through it. 

If the mushrooms are old and large they must be 
peeled and cut into pieces. If they are to be served with 
the roast or as a stew, let them simmer slowly in butter 
and their own juice until tender. 

Serve with smoked salmon, roast chicken, veal cut- 
lets or veal stew. 

62. Stuffed Mushrooms. Mushrooms to be stuffed 
must retain their stalks. Afte r carefully peeling the 
mushrooms and the stalks, washand let them d ry, then 
make a good veal forcemeat as described for stuffed 
cucumbers, omitting the mushrooms ; press 'some of the 
forcemeat on every stalk as far as the head so that it 
will adhere tightly. Then stew the mushrooms in plenty 
of melted butter until tender and serve with a sauce as 
described for stuffed cucumbers. 

63. Fried Mushrooms. First cut off the sandy end 
of the stalk, break it from the head and peel; take off 
the mushrooms, rinse them in water and drain on a col- 
ander, cut them into thin slices and have some butter 
ready in a frying pan in which the mushrooms are fried 
over a hot fire until done. 

They often yield cnpsiflemhle iuice and must, there- 



fore, be t uruedquite IrequentiyT ToHierwise they will 
become tougn. as soon as tne slices begin to fry they 
snould "trc-SH-rfced- plentifully ; add some ground pepper 
and serve with bread or potatoes. They may be fried 
in fat without onions, and can also be cooked rapidly 
with butter and a little beef broth. When mushrooms 
are fried or cooked for too long a time they become 
tough. 

64. Fresh Truffles. The truffles are not peJed

water. Put them on the Are in 1 trinfro f ( Burgundy o r 
other goodjed wine, all kinds of whole spices, a plUb^of- 
fresh butter,'"sait,"*aiid a few slices of lemon and cook 
until they are tender. Serve on a folded napkin with 
fresh butter. Or they can be served in a dish with sauce 
poured over them. 

65. Another method of cooking Truffles. Clean a,s 
directed just preceding. Put fat pork slices into a stew- 
pan with a bay leaf, some thyme, salt and coarse ground 
pepper, lay the truffles on these and cover them with 
slices of fat pork ; add 4 glassfuls- of strong white wine^ 
and a piece of nice butter, cook for a goodnall hour - " 
and serve very hot on a napkin. 

* This makes one of the finest dishes that can be 
/erved and is brought to the table as an ejjtrjajnanjadi- 
fee^aiterihe^gup^or else (garnished with escallops or 
'veal croquettes) in a middle course. 

66. Sweet Chestnuts. Shell and then blanch them. 
Put them in a stewpan, adding fresh butter, salt, some 
sugar and a strong beef broth, and simmer slowly until 
tender; the broth is nicely thickened with flour browned 
in butter. Serve very hot, garnishing with juicy cutlets, 
or else bring to the table with winter cabbage as a side 
dish. 

67. Winter Carrots, After washing and scraping 
the carrots, wash them again and take the lower ends 
in order to get as much as possible a dish similar to 
early carrots ; they should be cooked as directed for the 
latter, only sweetening with some sugar, and finally 
adding some chopped parsley. 

Serve with the same meats, etc., as directed for 
early carrots. 

Remark.— Washing vegetables of every description before and after cleaning 
them, has a great influence in' attaining good results in cooking, and this is 
particularly the case with all bulbs and roots, which should invariably be rubbed 
between the hands in water and then rinsed in fresh water several times, because 
the outer peel or skin usually imparts a strong flavor to the dish. Roots, however, 
should never be washed after they are cut, because some of their sweetness is 
thereby lost ; carrots as well as turnips should be cooked aB long as possible, for 
this increases their palatableness. 

68. Another method of cooking Winter Carrots. 

Clean the carrots and cut them into very fine shreds, 



Vegetables. 79 

put them on the fire in not too much boiling water with 
a few finely chopped onions and some kidney suet; cook 
quickly until tender; adding the salt towards the last. 
Then melt a few pieces of butter on the carrots, thicken 
the broth with cornstarch or flour and stir with chopped 
parsley. Shortly before serving, pared sour apples cut 
into halves may be put on the carrots ; let them simmer 
until cooked and lay the apples on top of the carrots 
when bringing them to the table. 

Or else put a layer of potatoes of uniform size on 
the carrots % hour before the latter are quite done, add 
the necessary salt and when the potatoes are cooked 
put on them small pieces of butter, stir with some finely 
chopped parsley before serving, and, according to taste, 
add a little vinegar. Time of cooking, 1—1% hours. 

Serve with smoked meats, fried sausages or head- 
cheese. 

69. Stuffed Tomatoes. Take nice, ripe tomatoes, 
scoop them out carefully, pass the pulp through a sieve 
and make a dressing of either chopped mushrooms, 
grated stale wheat bread, creamed butter, salt and pep- 
per, or else with finely chopped mutton, roast meat 
gravy, a few eggs, grated bread and fine herbs ; fill the 
tomatoes with the mixture. Bake the tomatoes in but- 
ter for about 15 minutes, sprinkle with lemon juice and 
serve with toast as an entree or as a garnish for more 
important dishes in middle courses. 

70. Spanish Tomatoes. Cut ripe tomatoes into 
slices, salt, cover and set aside for an hour. In the 
meantime boiled ham is finely chopped ; butter a drip- 
ping pan, fill it with ham and tomatoes in alternate 
layers, cover the surface with pieces of butter and grated 
wheat bread ; bake for 30 minutes. When done, turn 
out of the pan carefully, pour over it a brown sauce, 
garnish with small roasted potatoes xind serve. 

71. Parsnips. After washing the parsnips, scrape 
and then wash them again and cut them into short, 
thick pieces. Put butter into water, bring to a boil, 
put in the parsnips gradually, add salt and cook until 
tender, which will take about 1 hour. The broth should 
be plentiful and will be thick enough of itself without

any addition; season with a little nutmeg. PLvsnips 
can also be cooked in a meat broth. with its own fat. 
Serve with cutlets of all kinds and fried sausages. 

72. Turnips. "Wash them, pare and wash them 
again, cut into narrow slices and parboil if necessary ; 
then cook until tender in not too much water with some 
good kidney suet and salt ; put in a few pieces of butter 
and stir through the dish 1 — 2 tablespoonfuls of sweet 
cream and a little cornstarch. When serving, grate 
a little nutmeg over the turnips. Potatoes can be 
served with the turnips, either cooked or roasted, or else 
they may be cooked with them. 

Serve with beef roasted like hare, warm or cold 
smoked meats, fried sausages and fried liver. 

73. Winter Cabbage, Bremen Style. Prrepn yinter 
cabbage has ^at»so strong a flavor as the brown va riet y 
and is "therefore T ^efara^Ie^'o liKeTa^Eer. iftEecabbage"' 
is frozen take the hearf only and the leaves nearest the 
heart, together with the stalk as far as tender, washing 
carefully. It is best to prepare the cabbage the evening 
previous, letting it freeze again over night. Where the 
cabbage has a strong flavor it is well to first parboil it 
in plenty of water for about 10' minutes. Then put 
some boiling water with plenty of goose-grease or lard 
and butter on the fire, put in the cabbage in layers, 
with plenty of small onions, adding salt sparingly be- 
cause cabbage is very easily oversalted, cover tightly 
and cook slowly. It must be thoroughly done but not 
soft and should not be stirred ; ordinarily 2 hours will 
be sufficent time for cooking. If it should lack sweet- 
ness put in a piece of sugar early in the cooking. When 
ready to serve, the broth, which should be rather scant, 
can be bound with a little flour or cornstarch. 

Garnish with stewed chestnuts (see A, 39,) which 
may, however, also be stirred through the cabbage or 
else be brought to the table in a separate dish. Serve 
as a side dish small potatoes, roasted raw to a nice 
brown color. Serve the cabbage with roast goose, 
stuffed spareribs, roast pork, roast beef, round of beef, 
fried pork sausages or pork chops. 

In Bremen this cabbage is usually cooked with 
"Pinkel" sausages (made of beef kidney suet and oat- 



Vegetables. 81 

meal); sometimes the cabbage is brought on the fire 
after being put in the kettle with oatmeal layers be- 
tween it alternately. 

74. Shredded Cabbage, Westphalian Style. Take 
the heart, together with all the green leaves of the cab- 
bage, wash, cut into shreds on a chopping board, and 
parboil for 10 minutes and then cook until tender in 
not too much water with goose-grease or else butter 
and lard half and half, adding a few small onions and 
some salt. A little sugar and a trifle of cornstarch are 
added' towards the last. Serve with stewed chestnuts 
and roast potatoes, but if a fat meat is served, roast 
goose for instance, then boiled potatoes are preferable. 

Time of cooking, about 2 hours. 

75. Sourkrout. Take it carefully out of the keg or 
other vessel in which it is contained, rejecting all that 
may not be of the proper color. Press it vigorously 
and if it should be too sour pour hot water over it, dry 
quickly; it should not be rinsedTTKidney suet, butter 
and lard in equal parts make an excellent fat for cook- 
ing sourkrout. Bring the fat to a boil in the necessary 
amount of water, put in the sourkrout with a few pep. 
percorns, cover tightly and cook with a quick fire, add. 
ing some salt if necessary. If liked a little bunch oi 
juniper berries and carraway tied in a cloth can be 
cooked with the krout. When ready to serve some corn- 
starch or flour, or still better grated potatoes, should 
be stirred through the dish. 

Serve with mashed potatoes or a puree of peas. 

If the cabbage has been cut very fine and put up 
without any salt, about % — 1 hour is necessary for 
cooking, otherwise it will take about 1% hours, and if 
made from winter cabbage it will take from 3 — i hours. 

The following method is preferable for cooking sour- 
krout because it thereby retains its bright appearance : 
Bring wine and water half and half to a boil, and then 
put in the sourkrout with some salt and a few pepper- 
corns and cook until tender. Shortly before serving 
pour off all the broth and stir plenty of butter through 
the sourkrout. 

Sourkrout is usually served with partridges, pheas- 
ants, goose liver patties, liver dumplings, fried liver, 



82 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

baked pike, headcheese, roast pig, roast pork, spare 
ribs, boiled ham, and particularly pickled pigs' feet. A 
puree of peas makes a very good side dish. 

. 76. Sourkrout for the Family Table. Prepare in the 
first place as described just above. Put water in suffi- 
cient quantity with lard on the fire, bring to a boil, put 
in the sourkrout and cook" until done. If one wishes to 
cook a piece of ham or bacon in the krout, it must not 
be too salty, and should be cooked until about half 
done before the krout is put into the kettle. Pat pork 
can also be used to advantage as described for the pre- 
paration of greens under No. 14 of this division; the 
melted fat can then be put to the sourkrout. It is 
better to cook the potatoes alone because the acid of 
the sourkrout is apt to make them a trifle hard; stir 
them into the dish at last. 1 — 2 raw potatoes grated 
and stirred through the dish after it is thoroughly 
cooked gives it a nice consistency and a good color. 
Dried white beans cooked until quite tender together 
with their own broth can also be stirred through the 
krout, shortly before serving. 

Time of cooking as above noted. 

77. Sourkrout with Pike. Prepare the krout as 
directed in the last preceding receipt, clean the fish, cut 
off the head and put the liver into the mouth. Put the 
fish on the fire in enough water to cover,. together 
with some butter, peppercorns, bay leaves,- cloves and 
salt;, when the head is half done take it out and lay it 
aside, cooking the rest until done and then boning it. 
Put the sourkrout with the fish into the dish in layers, 
rounding it in the middle, pour over it a few spoonfuls 
of good cream and 1 to 2 whipped eggs, sprinkle over it 
rolled crackers, put the head of the fish with the liver 
on the rounding in the middle of the dish, and then bake 
in the oven for about 30 minutes. To preserve the head 
cover it during the baking with a piece of buttered 
paper. 

Crabs can also be cooked with this style of sour- 
krout. Fill the shells with a crab forcemeat, cook in 
salt water or the fish broth and use them together with 
the crab tails to garnish the border of the dish. 



Vegetables. 83 

78. Sourkrout with Stewed Oysters and Rhinewine. 

Press the krout well and cook for 8 hours in boiling 
water adding 1 pound of unsalted butter for every 3 
pounds of krout ; then put in 1 bottle of Rhinewine and 
let it simmer slowly until little or no broth remains. 
Serve the krout placed in the dish around the edges, 
leaving the center open, which is filled with an oyster 
stew. Bring to the table hot. 

79. Sourkrout with Pheasants and Oysters. Pre- 
pare the pheasant as for a roast; then lightly press 
about 2 pounds of sourkrout (if it should be too sour 
freshen it), put it in a stewpan, pour over it white wine 
and water half and half, enough to cover the krout, put 
in a good-sized lump of lard and a chopped onion and 
let it cook slowly for an hour. Then put in the pheas- 
ant and let it cook slowly for another hour and after it 
is tender take it out and thicken the sourkrout slightly 
with a sauce made of % tablespoonful of fineflour rubbed 
in 1% tablespoonf uls of fresh butter, together with 2 
chopped onions, afterwards smoothed in a large cupful 
of clear stock and cook for % hour; then stir through it 
the same quantity of sweet cream, bring the sauce to a 
boil, thicken with the yolks of 2 eggs and pass through 
a fine sieve, season with salt and some lemon juice. 

Remove the beards from 40—50 oysters, dry them 
in a cloth, sprinkle each oyster with salt and pepper, 
turn in flour and dip in egg and breadcrumbs; have 
hot lard or butter ready and fry the oysters to a nice 
brown color shortly before they are to be served. Carve 
the pheasant, garnishing first with the sourkrout and 
with a border of the oysters. If one wishes to serve the 
oysters in another style, remove the beards, put the 
oysters on the stove and get them hot, but do not cook 
" them. Add the liquor of the oysters to the sourkrout, 
thicken the latter with a sauce made as above directed, 
adding a few drops of lemon juice. Serve with the oys- 
ters placed in the center of the dish encircled with the 
sourkrout and the pheasant as a border. 

80. To cook Beans salted for Winter use. Freshen 
the beans early in the morning, cover them with water, 
which should be renewed several times ; then cook them 
in an unglazed stone coo king vessel in the same manner 



84 Kj.— .Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

as fresh beans, but after they have cooked for a time 
put in ^leu^oXJaoilingjnnk^which preserve s their natu- 
ral colorTbeingcareful, however, to~coo1r+hem rapidly 
and*uirmterruptedly until tender. After this proceed 
with their preparation the same as with fresh beans, 
and the difference between the two cau be hardly not- 
iced. 

Time of cooking, and serve with the same dishes, as 
noted for fresh beans. 

81. Pickled String Beans. Cook them until tender 
and then rinse them repeatedly to extract the salt and 
pour them on a colander ; after this cook the beans in 
water with kidney suet and lard half and half with a 
scant broth, salting as much as is necessary. After- 
wards put in the white beans which have been cooked 
until quite tender, together with their broth and stir 
well together, or else the string beans are put into the 
dish along the edges and the white beans filled into the 
center. Instead of the white beans, a number of small 
potatoes parboiled can be cooked with the beans until 
done, and a grated raw potato stirred through them as 
directed for sourkrout. Time of cooking, 1 — 2 hours, 
according to the quality. 

Serve with smoked meat, boiled ham, fried sausages, 
pork chops, smoked tongue and freshened herring. 

82. Pickled Salad Beans are parboiled, then fresh- 
ened and stewed like fresh salad beans, or else the broth 
is poured off and a thick egg sauce is put over them. 

Serve with meats as directed in the preceding receipt. 

83. Dried Peas or Pea Puree. Prepare as directed 
for pea soup, and after pouring off the water cook them 
in a scant broth with the necessary fat until rather 
thick, add the salt, pass through a strainer, bring to a 
boil again, put into the dish, rounding them high in the 
center, smoothing the surface nicely, cover with onions 
browned in butter and put strips of toast around the 
edges. 

Time of cooking, 2 hours. Serve with salt pork of 
every kind or nicely freshened herring. 

84. White Beans. Cook them the same as peas 
until tender, but pour the water off twice and do not

strain Tcnem. After bringing to a boil thje second time 
stir in good fat and before serving stir salt and a little 
vinegar through, the beans. The beans should not be 
too dry. , , 

Or else cook the beans without either fat or vinegar, 
pour off the broth and serve with pork or onion sauce, 
or else with butter and vinegar. 

White beans are excellent when stewed with crab 
sauce. Serve with boiled ham, roast beef or kettle 
roast, fried liver, fried sausages, calf's head jelly. 

85. Lentils. Prepare as directed for peas, parboil, 
drain and serve with an onion sauce poured over them. 

Or else, after parboiling, cook the lentils until tender 
with a small piece of pork and a few onions and then 
stir a little flour and vinegar into the broth, which 
should not be too scant. 

Time of cooking, the same as for peas and beans. 

86. Lentils in flecklenburg Style. After the lentils 
have been well picked over and washed they are cooked 
until tender. Then pour off all of the water and put in 
a meat broth with chopped green leek and celery, cook 
for quite a while longer and thicken with flour rubbed 
in plenty of fat. 

Or else, after cooking the lentils for an hour, pour 
off the water and then cook them in fresh water until 
quite tender. Then cut a piece of fat pork into slices 
and fry in butter with plenty of onions until it com- 
mences to froth, lightly brown in this according to 
quantity, 1, 2"or 3 spoonfuls of flour, stir with meat 
broth to make a thick sauce, add vinegar, salt and 
pepper, pour onto the lentils and cook them until done. 



87. Artichokes for Invalids. Prepare the artichokes, 
cut them into pieces and cook in salted water until 
tender, pass through a sieve and mix with fresh butter, 
grated wheat bread and a few yolks of eggs whipped 
with sweet cream. A puree of cauliflowers can be made 
in the same manner for invalids. 

88. Puree of white Beans for Convalescents. This 
should be served only when permitted by the physician. 



86 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

Soak the beans over night, cook them in water until 
quite tender and then strain. In the meantimechop the 
meat of a few boiled crabs quite fine, mix with the puree 
of the beans, add some crab butter and 1 cupful of beef 
broth and cook all together. Stir into the puree the 
yolks of several eggs whipped in cream, and serve with 
tender cutlets or roast chicken. 

Many of' the vegetable dishes in this division are fit 
for invalids, among them Nos. 2, 4, 15, 16, 17, 21, 36, 
38 and 60, but care should be taken to usually omit 
sharp spices or seasoning. 



II. POTATOES. 

S. How to cook Potatoes. Vs\r ton littlft rare is 
quite frequently exercised in cooking potatoes ana yet 
when well cooked they make very palatable Wishes, pre- 
ferred by many to other perhaps more elegant articles 
of food. Without question, muchdepends upon carefu l

size; before paring wash them and throw them into 
fresh water as soon as pared,' rub them several times 
between the hands in the water, rinse and keep them 
covered in fresh water until wanted for use. Then drain 
them on a colander, pour Clearwater over them and put 
on the fire in a Settle which should not be too small and 
be used for this purpose only; have the water cover 
them and put in salt in the proportion of about % of a 
teaspoonful to a quart of Water. It should be noted

cook neither too rapidly nor too slowly until done. It 
is well to try them occasionally in order to determine 
whether they are done; if they can be easily pierced with 
a fork they may be considered done. They should not 
fall to pieces, neither must they be brought to the table 
half done. Pour the water off carefully — none must 
remain in the kettle — and put the kettle back on the 
fire for a few minutes longer, taking off the cover, shak- 
ing the potatoes so that all watery particles mayeva-

pOrate, and then let them stand on the back of the 
stove. It is much better, however, to bring them to the 
table at once in a covered warm dish after they have 
been evaporated, because n othing loses in palatableuess 
so m uch through standingas potatoes. 

"The longer or sE!or^ra 1iration""oTtrhi e for cooking 
potatoes de pends upon thfrvanetyan dTTn* a measure, 
upon t he season ; nice Iresh potatoes need about 15 to 
20 minutes. Potatoes grown in light sandy soil are the 
best. 

2. Potatoes with various Kinds of Sauces. After 
cooking potatoes as directed above, cover them with a 
sauce made of either onions, fat and parsley, or else a 
slightly sour milk sauce, or a Bechamel, Maitre de Hotel 
or an anchovy sauce (see under R) and cover the dish 
tightly, or else the sauce may be served separately. 

3. Potatoes with Herring. Cook the potatoes in 
their jackets with salt, then peel and slice, keeping them 
as hot as possible. In the meantime lightly brown a 
few onions in plenty of butter, add some flour, after this 
some water, salt, ground pepper, a little vinegar and, if 
handy, a few bay leaves ; when this begins to cook put 
in the sliced potatoes and then the boned herrings cut 
into small pieces. After everything is thoroughly 
cooked and very hot, stir through it some cream. This 
dish should be very juicy and not stiff. 

4. Potatoes with Parsley and Boiled Fish. Peel 
small potatoes, cook them in salted water on a quick, 
fire until done, being careful that they remain whole. 
After pouring off the water carefully, shake the pota- 
toes on top of the stove with plenty of fresh butter and 
finely chopped parsley. Serve at once. 

5. Sour Potatoes with Bay Leaves. Slowly try out 
some pork fat or else get some other kind of good fat 
nicely hot, lightly brown in it finely chopped onions, 
stir with it water, salt and a little pepper, and boil the 

. potatoes in it with some bay leaves until done. Before 
serving take out the bay leaves and add a dash of vine- 
gar, and if they should not be of the proper consistency 
thicken with a little browned flour. Be careful to have 
the dish nice and juicy. 



88 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

6. Breaded Potatoes. Take potatoes of a — edium 
and uniform size and after washing, cook them in their 
jackets with some salt until done, but they must not be 
soft. Then peel them, cut into thick slices, dip into 
a whipped egg and turn in bread or cracker crumbs. 
Heat some good fat with plenty of good butter in a 
clean sauce pan, put in the sliced potatoes side by side 
and fry over a medium fire, lightly brown on both sides, 
keeping the pan uncovered ;~ serve at once. This makes 
a nice side dish for spinach, Brussels sprouts, red cab- 
bage and for various kinds of meats. 

7. Roast Potatoes. Peel quite small potatoes of 
uniform size, wash and cook in salted water until half 
done and then drain until dry. Then heat some butter 
and good fat in one or two saucepans on a medium 
fire, put in the steaming potatoes side by side, cover the 
pan tightly and when the lower sides of the potatoes are 
brown turn them and cover again until they are done, 
after which they should be roasted in the uncovered pan 
until browned, being careful not to scorch them. In 
order to preserve their nice appearance and smoothness 
they should not be touched with a fork while cooking; 
the best way to turn them is to use a pancake turner. 
PnBjfc ing sugar over the potatoes when they are roast- 
n^^n^TeBxnem^o'o"ir ^lossy_. i 

" Should the potatoes accidentally have been cooked 
too long, be careful to put only those remaining whole 
and none of the broken ones into the pan. If potatoes 
cooked in their jackets are to be roasted, which, by the 
way, are not near as nice as the other kind, they are 
cooked until done in salted water, peeled while hot, 
roasted in an open pan, turning frequently. 

Raw potatoes roasted are preferred by many to any 
other kind, Select small, round potatoes of a uniform 
size, wash them carefully and drain well, roast them in 
an open pan in hot butter until brown, sprinkle with 
fine salt, cover the pan or kettle and shake frequently 
until done. Serve immediately. 

8. Potatoes with Buttermilk. Boil the potatoes 
until soft, add buttermilk and let them cook for a while 
longer with pieces of browned pork fat cut into cubes. 
When they do not fall to pieces, a little flour stirred with 



Potatoes. 89 

buttermilk may be added. Or else the potatoes are 
cooked in their jackets until soft and then cut' into 
slices. Heat some fat, brown some flour in it, stir with 
buttermilk to a plentiful thick sauce, salt and then cook 
the potatoes until done. 

°. Curried Potatoes. Curry powder is composed of 
various strong spices and can be obtained in most drug 
stores or first-class groceries. 

Boil small potatoes and shake them several times 
with plenty of butter and 1 tablespoonful or more of 
curry powder, let the kettle stand for a short time on 
the top of the stove. Serve as soon as possible. 

Curried potatoes are appropriate side dishes for all 
kinds of cabbages and roast meats. 

10. Baked Potatoes with Sausages. Fry the saus- 
ages in butter with finely chopped onions, take them 
out of the pan, stir a spoonful of flour into the fat and 
afterwards some good meat broth, gravy fat from roast 
meats, salt and pepper. 

Cook the potatoes in their jackets, slice them while 
still hot, put them into the pan with the sausages and 
simmer for a short time. Put a layer of these pota- 
toes into a buttered dish dusted with bread or cracker 
crumbs, put on them the sausages cut into pieces 2 to 3 
inches long, on these put another layer of potatoes, 
coverwiih bread or cracker crumbs, pour over it melted 
butter, then bake in an oven for about % of an hour or 
until it is nicely crusted. Turn out of the pan and serve. 

11. Potatoes, Spareribs and Sour Apples baked to- 
gether. Put the spareribs on a medium fire, half cov- 
ered with salted water, in a rather shallow fryingpan, 
cover the pan tightly and let the meat cook moderately 
for 1 — 1% hours until of a light brown color. Then take 
them out of the pan and cover the latter with small, 
round potatoes, peeled, put on a little salt, lay the 
spareribs over them with the opening towards the top, 
and fill this with pared and quartered apples, add a 
cupful of water, cover and let the potatoes roast slowly 
until they are tender and brown, turning them once. 

Serve the spareribs with the apples in a deep dish, 
using the potatoes as a garnish. This dish is best 
cooked in an oven. 



90 C— Potatoes and other Vegetables. 

12. Baked Potatoes with Cheese. Cut boiled pota- 
toes into slices and put them in layers into a buttered 
pan. Cover every layer with a sauce made of sour 
cream, eggs and Parmesan cheese, continuing in this 
manner until the pan is filled. For 4 persons take 1 . 

Eint of cream, 4 eggs and. about 3 ounces of cheese, 
lake in an oven for about % hour and serve as a side 
dish with ham, beefsteak and other meats of a similar 
kind. 

13. Stuffed Potatoes (an original receipt). Peel 
large potatoes, cut off a slice, scoop them out and fill 
with a dressing made of roast meat remnants *of any 
kind, preferably pork ; chop the meat very fine and mix 
with a few eggs, chopped parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg 
and grated bread; put a tablespoonful into every po- 
tato and tie on with a thread the slice that has been 
cut off. Bake slowly in plenty of fat until done ; they 
should be lightly brown in color. This makes an excel- 
lent side dish with greens and lettuce. 

14. Potatoes with Apples. This dish is prepared 
best by cooking potatoes until done in salted water and 
mashing them. Stir through them a piece of butter, 
then mix with them an applesauce, which should be 
rather thick but not too sweet, taking about % as many 
apples as you have potatoes. In case the dish should 
be too stiff, put in some boiling water and cook. When 
done, ' put into an appropriate dish and cover with 
browned bread crumbs, or else pass with it melted but- 
ter, sugar and browned cracker crumbs. 

To save time the apples can be cut into pieces and 
be put with the potatoes after the latter are fully half 
done, pouring off part of the water. Cook until done, 
stir butter through it and bring to the-table as already 
directed. 

Serve with roast hare, sour beef, cutlets, fried liver, 
sausage, ham and chopped meat balls. 

15. Potatoes and fresh Pears are best cooked with 
a piece of lean pork which has already been boiled until 
half done, otherwise with fat and butter ; the pears must 
be nearly done before the potatoes, which should first 
be boiled until done, are put with them. 



Before serving, stir through with some vinegar, but 
the potatoes must not become mashed. Instead of the 
vinegar a few sour apples may be added to the pears 
£fter putting in the potatoes. Like all other dishes 
made of potatoes this one should not be too stiff. 

Instead of pears, plums can also bestirred through 
the potatoes after the- latter have first been stirred 
through with butter, but in this case omit the pork and 
use any other kind of roast meat. Instead of the fresh 
fruit dried apples, pears or prunes can be taken, but 
they must then be stewed before putting them in with 
the potatoes, which should first be cooked until done 
and then mashed. Sometimes 2 eggs are whipped with 
2 spoonfuls of milk and stirred through the dried fruit, 
and then fat pork, smoked sausage or ham is served 
with the dish. 

16. Potato Balls (Rissoles). Cook the potatoes in 
salted water, drain entirely dry and mash. Mix them 
with a few eggs, a piece of butter, nutmeg according to 
taste, and a few spoonfuls of sour cream. Then roll into 
small balls, sprinkle them with rolled crackers and fry 
in butter. For the family table potatoes left over can 
be used, which are mashed, mixed with egg and fried as 
above. 

These potato balls make a nice adjunct to greens or 
lettuce. 

17. Potato Noodles. Take a deep plate full of peeled 
and grated potatoes cooked in their jackets the day 
previous in salted water, together with 4 eggs, 4 
spoonfuls of cream or milk, the same quantity of melted 
butter and add whatever salt may be necessary. Put 
the potatoes on a bread board, make a hollow in the 
center into which put some flour and the eggs, cream, 
butter and salt, knead this to a dough, adding a little 
flour from time to time until the dough can bestretched 
and is compact and does not show any holes when cut. 
Koll the dough into oblong pieces about the size of a 
potato, cook for 8—10 minutes in boiling salted water, 
put them on a colander and after they are drained, fry 
them all around in butter until lightly brown. 

18. Sliced Potatoes (German Style). Peel the pota- 
toes, wash carefully and cut into very thin slices. Put 



§2 C— Potatoes and other- Vegetables. 

plenty of lard and butter half and half into a pari or 
else brown some fat pork in it, put in the potatoes 
about an inch deep, sprinkle with salt, add a cupful of 
water and cover the pan tightly. After the potatoes 
have been browned over a medium fire until done, they 
may be sent to the table or else turned in the pan and 
browned on the other side. 

Instead of raw potatoes, cold potatoes that have 
been left over may be cut into slices and fried in butter 
or other good fat. About % the quantity of sliced sour 
apples can be laid on the potatoes and, covered tightly, 
fried in butter to a nice brown ; the potatoes can also 
be stirred with 2—3 eggs mixed with a little milk. 

19. Roast Potatoes. Take good potatoes of a me- 
dium size, wash them very carefully, put them in an 
iron kettle, cover with water, cook until half done, pour 
off the water, sprinkle with some salt, cover tightly, put 
them on a medium fire or better still into a medium hot 
oven and roast until they are quite tender and nicely 
crusted. Serve with fresh butter. 

Nos. 4, 16 and 17 are well adapted for invalids.

1. GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

. Preparing the fleat. 1tfp«.+p shnnlri nover be washed 
more than is absolutely necessary to clean them, and 
they should never lay in the water, because they thereby 
lose too much str ength. Roast beef, bee fsteaks and 
mutton roast -eti»m*lt8&Fhnxn v i ill If j" | BSfcUng, and 
this should be done im mediately before cooking. Put 
the meat on the chopping" board and pound on each 
side, whereby it more fully retains its juiciness, then 
rinse the meat, dry it with a towel and proceed with the 
cooking. 

Veal and poultry are best scalded before roasting 
or stewing, pouring off the water immediately after. 
The meat is thereby improved in appearance and is 
more easily larded. 

Larding. Larding makes roasts juicier and im- 
proves their appearance. Use salted water and smoked 
fat pork for larding, taking for this purpose a piece 
from the shoulder, cut obliquely into pieces 1&— 2 inches 
wide, divide them into thin slices and from thesecut the 
lardoons of the size required. 

The meat which is to be larded should be laid on a 
meat board, put a lardoon into the larding needle, 
draw the pin and part of the fat, of which the two ends 
should be of equal length, through the meat. Proceed 
thus until the entire piece is covered with lardoons 
placed at regular intervals and in as straight a line as 
is possible. The yrain of the meat should be taken into 
consideration w hen larding; it must run crosswise to 
the larding needle, tnen commence a new row. 



94 D.— Meats. 

In larding hares, put 2 rows of lardoons along each 
side of the back, making 4 rows in all; usually 2 are 
sufficient. Other kinds of game or poultry are larded 
in the same manner, but quite young and tender poul- 
try, sweetbreads, etc., should be hardened before larding 
by pouring hot water over them. 

Cooking Heat. All kinds of meat, including salted 
and smoked if it is freshened, should be put on the stove 
in boiling water, because it thus loses less of its juiciness 
and is done sooner. Regarding fresh meats for soups 
all necessary remarks have already been made in the 
chapter devoted to soups. The time necessary until the 
meat becomes tender, depends upon the age of the beef, 
and the size of the piece, but in general the following 
table can be depended upon : Fresh beef, up to 3 hours; 
smoked beef or a whole smoked ham, 3%— 4 hours; 
pickled meats, 3— 3% hours; veal, IK— 2 hours; mutton, 
2—2% hours; poultry, 3 hours; spring chickens, %—l 
hour; pigeons, % hour at the furthest; "a pig's or calf's 
head, 2 — 2% hours; game, according to its kind, from 
2—2% hours. 

If asoup is not to be made from the meat, allow it 
to simmer slowly because it thereby fully retains its 
juiciness. If cooked in vessels that can be tightly cov- 
ered the meat can be put on the fire without any water, 
simply with fat or butter, otherwise put on the stove 
and not in the oven, and in this case with boiling water, 
which should be replenished as it evaporates. As soon 
as this broth begins to cook move the vessel to the 
back part of the stove where the meat will finish cook-* 
ing slowly. / 

Roasting. Roasted meats are done quicker than 
when cooked in any other way. It is not advisable to 
roast meats on top of the stove ; the meat is far better 
when roasted in the oven. Small cuts only, like chops, 
etc., should be fried or roasted in the frying pan, unless 
one prefers broiling. 

In broiling, put the meat over glowing coals or on. 
a hot fire-place; as soon as heated, butter and then put 
the meat on the broiler; turn when necessary. In turn- 
ing, be careful not to pierce the meat with the fork, in 
fact this precaution is necessary with roasts of all kinds. 



Beef. 95 

When roasting meat in the oven it s hould be prop- 
erly h eated before the meat is put in, be cause this 
tends "to roast the meat uniformly all around and it 
loses little or none of its juiciness. Thereafter allow the 
heat in the oven to gradually diminish. 

Baste -the roast frequently with the added fat, or in 
case of a pork roast or roast goose, with their own fat. 
I* the top heat is too great it is well to cover the roast 
with a piece of buttered paper ; care should be taken to 
observe whether the heat radiating from the sides of 
the oven is of equal intensity or not, because it may be 
necessary to turn the roast with the pan — notinthe pan. 

For roasts that are to be well done an earthenware 
roasting pan is the best, and repeated basting with 
boiling water or meat broth is necessary. If, on the 
contrary, the roast is wanted rare the ordinary roast- 
ing pan can be used, the heat in the oven should be 
greater and the addition of water be avoided ; plenty of 
fat should be put with the roast from the start. As the 
clear fat easily absorbs great heat, the roast receives a 
nice crust, retains its juice and is more quickly done, 
consequently the inner part of the roast does not receive 
heat enough to thoroughly cook it. If the fat should 
begin to brown the roast it can be taken out of the 
oven and set for awhile on the stove without detriment. 
If the roast is really scorched, however, which may 
happen to the best cook under an unfortunate conjunc- 
tion of circumstances, it is still possible to save it by 
carefully cutting away the scorched parts and then 
cooking the remainder for several minutes in boiling 
water, which should be frequently renewed. The scorchy 
taste is thereby largely removed and the meat can then 
be roasted in fresh browned butter until done. 

Roasts should never be left in the oven. longer than 
necessary for them to become done ; meats roasted for 
too lon g a time aredr vanrl tasteless It is art visa hla~ 
however^ io leave tne roast in the pan and put it on the 
top of the stove for a short quarter of an hour before it 
is served; this prevents the juice from dripping away 
when carving. The gravy is made from the drippings 
in the pan. 

Gravy. Plenty of good rich gravy is essential with 
a roast. Nothing jgjbetter thjuij:xe^miQXJCPJLsts of all

kinds, because it makes the meat milder and the gravy 
more palatable. But cream is not always easily ob- 
tained, and therefore the cook must provide for a substi- 
tute by setting aside some milk early enough. After the 
roast has been taken out of the pan stir some fine flour 
into the latter (for 6 persons a ro,ast weighing. 6 — 7 
pounds will take "about a small tablespoonful) and stir 
constantly until brown. Then stir in the requisite quan- 
tity of water, loosening everything adhering to the pan. 
If it should happen that the p-mvv ip too flalty or to o 
dark in color, this can be mm^rljerl hy pouringi n some

"Tacking. Good gravy must not be too salty, but of a 
nice consistency and lightly brown in color; scorched or 
watery gravies spoil the best meat dishes. If not other-

Meat Remnants. As soon as meats are brought 
from the table, they should be taken out of the gravy 
or juice and immediately placed into a refrigerator or 
jto the cellar. 



I. BEEF. 



2. Roast Beef. The best cut of beef for roasting is 
the sirloin or English cut ; that most commonly used is 
the rib roast; the former has the tenderloin under the 
rib-bone. After removing the greater part of the fat, 
wash, dry it with a towel and pound as directed in No. 1. 
For a large roast put a pound of thick, solid kidney 
suet into water over night, cut it into small cubes (kid- 
ney suet and fat pork, half and half, can also be used) ; 
put it on the fire in a perfectly clean dripping pan and 
try it out slowly, then sprinkle the beef with fine salt 
and put it in the pan with the tenderloin to the top, 
drip half of the fat over it and then place it uncovered 
into a hot oven in order that it may roast rapidly, 
basting very frequently because both are necessary to 
prevent the juices from running out of the meat; after- 
wards . have a more moderate fire and finish roasting 
without turning the meat or piercing it with a fork.

The fat should remain clear and is poured out of the 
pan before making the gravy, which is prepared as 
already described. Mushrooms are much liked in roast 
beef gravies and are either stewed in butter previously 
to putting them into the gravy, or else let them simmer 
in meat broth until tender, using the broth instead of 
water to finish 1 he gravy. 

3. Kettle Roast of Beef . For kettle roasts, the meat 
need not necessarily be taken from young beef, but it 
should be well pounded. Put'a pound of kidney suet into 
water over night, cut it into small pieces (instead of the 
suet half as much pork fat can be used), put into a 
kettle and try it out, then put in the meat and roast it 
until it is nicely browned all around ; move it from side 
to side frequently, being careful not to pierce it with the 
fork. Then cover it with a part of the pieces of fat, 
pour in from the sidel — 2 cupfuls of boiling water, cover 
the kettle tightly, put it on the stove where it will roast 
uninterruptedly but not too vigorously. Eoast in this 
manner for 2 — 2% hours according to the size of the 
piece ; after roasting for about 1 hour turn the meat 
once with a skimmer and sprinkle with a little salt, 
always being careful not to pierce the meat. Make the 
gravy as previously directed ; axupful of sour cream is 
a favorite addition to gravy of this kind of roast. , 

4. Rolled Roast. Take a rib roast and have the 
ribs cut 'out, pound well and rub with salt, pepper and 
ground cloves, roll it tightly and tie it with a cord. 
Then roast for 3% hours as directed in No. 3, basting 
often; make a sauce as described in No. 1. 

Serve with compots, salads or with brown winter 
cabbage. The broth will make a good mushroom- or 
truffle sauce, in which the roast can be served with mac- 
aroni or roast potatoes in a middle course. 

5. Fillet of Beef. After larding, put it in the oven 
in an earthenware roasting pan with plenty of hot but- 
ter and roast rather gently for about % hour, basting 
frequently, and covering with thick cream. When serv- 
ing, stir a little water through the gravy ; the cream 
usually makes it thick enough. 

s^~~A. Bearnese sauce (see division R) is excellent with 
/ evervJsind-of-frllet of beef roast, which should be covered

with the sauce immediately before serving. These roasts 
may be varied by means of numerous different kinds of 
gravies, such as truffle-, mushroom-, Madeira- and Bur- 
gundy sauces, etc. A further variation is attainable by 
serving the fillet roasff with all kinds of vegetables (filet 
a la jardinere). The vegetables are taken according to 
season : in the Spring, peas, carrots, kohlrabi, aspara- 
gus and the hearts of lettuce; in the Summer, string 
beans, cauliflowers, mushrooms and small potatoes; in 
the Fall, small heads of isavoy cabbage, artichokes, 
cauliflowers, tomatoes and stewed onions; inthe Winter, 
salsify, savoy cabbage, sweet turnips and endives. All 
of the vegetables must be gotten ready neatly, remov- 
ing stalks and cores where necessary. 

6. Fillet of. Beef with Madeira Sauce. Brown some 
flour in butter, with it stir dark soup stock or other 
good meat broth, add a bay leaf, pepper, salt, some 
cayenne pepper and 2 glassfuls Of Madeira, stir well 
together and put into this sauce pieces of veal sweet- 
breads, little dumplings, mushrooms and a few sliced 
truffles. The meat is first roasted until half done, then 
put into the sauce, roast it slowly for another half hour 
and serve with all of the additions with which it has 
been cooked. Frequently macaroni a,re cooked in salted . 
water until half done and then finished in meat broth 
with Madeira; they are then placed around. the roast in 
the form of a wreath. Before serving with the roast 
shake the macaroni with butter and grated cheese. 

7. Rossini Fillet. Cut the meat into slices, salt and 
turn in egg and bread or cracker crumbs, and roast in 
melted butter until juicy and well done. At the same 
time slice a nice goose liver (in the Summer take the 
half of of a calf's liver) and also dip in bread and roast 
it. Serve the slices in layers arranged in the form of a 
pyramid, and pour the gravy over them; make the 
gravyfrom the drippings of the meat, some sour cream, 
meat broth, a glassful 6f Madeira, thickening with a 
little rice flour. 

8. Beef a la mode. Take about 8—10 pounds of 
the round, pound it, rub with salt, pepper, and ground 
cloves ; it can also be larded if wished. Put about 2% 
ounces of kidney suet, prepared- as directed in A, 17, 



Beef. 99 

into a kettle, heat it, put in the meat, dredge a table- 
spoonful of flour over it, and roast until brown all over, 
turning from time to time. Then pour in from the side 
enough boiling water or better still half claret and half 
water to partly cover it, then put on the lid tightly and 
cook slowly, turning it after the elapse of 1% hours, 
adding a cupful of pickles cut into cubes, together with 
1 spoonful of 'vinegar, 4 bay leaves or a few lemon slices, 
cover again and cook slowly until tender, which will 
usually take from 2— 2% hours. Then put the meat into 
thedish in which it is to be served, skimming most of the 
fat from the gravy ; if the latter should be too thick add 
water to it, and if too thin thicken with a little corn- 
starch, put some of this gravy over the meat and bring 
the remainder to the table in a gravy boat. If the meat 
is to be served as an entremet, truffles, mushrooms or 
chestnuts may be served with it. It is usually served 
with vegetables of various kinds but macaroni are par- 
ticularly recommended. Very often the meat receives 
no preliminary roasting, but is immediately put into 
the kettle, which is lined with sliced fat pork, carrots, 
etc.; cover with white wine and meat broth and season 
with spices of various kinds, according to taste. In 
France this kind of a roast is served with a tomato 
sauce; in Bavaria, with a mushroom sauce, using for 
this purpose the broth from the roast. 

9. Sour Beef (Sauerbraten) No. 1. For a sour 
roast take a good, fat piece from the round. In the 
Summer let it layin vinegar 3 — 4 days and in theWinter 
8 — 10 days. Then add bay leaves, cloves, allspice and 
perhaps a few juniper berries to the vinegar; put it on 
the stove and bring to a boil ; the meat should first be 
freshened, then pour over it the boiling vinegar, which 
prevents the juices from being lost from the meat. If 
the vinegar is very sharp mix with a, little water. As 
onions harden in vinegar they should not be added until 
ready to cook. In the Summer the meat should be kept 
uncovered in a refrigerator or other cool place, turning 
it frequently, being careful not to do this with the 
hands. . Before cooking, lard the roast as follows, there- 
by making it juicier: Cut fat pork into strips the length 
of a finger, turn them in a mixture of salt, pepper and 
ground cloves, puncture the meat all over with a sharp 



100 D.— Meats. 

knife- and put in the lardoons ; sprinkle some more salt 
over the meat, but not too much — oversalting makes 
the meat tough. Get plenty of good fat quite hot in an 
iron kettle, put in the meat and allow the broth which 
gathers to steam away rapidly, lightly browning the 
meat all around, being careful to often turn it in the 
fat. Then put a heaping tablespoonf ul of flour into the 
fat, also browning it, and immediately pour in from the 
side enough boiling water to cover the meat, covering 
the kettle at once so that none of the flavor may be 
lost. After a few minutes add for a piece of meat* weigh- 
ing from 5 to 6 pounds, 2 small carrots, 3 to 4" large 
onions and a piece of rye bread crust, and if necessary 
some of the spiced vinegar in which the meat has laid ; 
then cover the kettle tightly and cook slowly but unin- 
terruptedly for about 2 — 2% hours, turning the meat 
during this time and occasionally lifting it with a fovk 
without piercing; add a little 'boiling water if necessary. 
A cupful of sweet cream put in during the last half hour 
of cooking greatly improves the gravy. When ready to 
serve put the meat on a warm dish and set it in the 
oven while the gravy is being prepared. If the latter 
should have become too thick during the cooking it can 
be thinned with water; if not thick enough, put in a 
little flour ; if it should be too sour and the color brown 
enough, put in a cupful of milk, then pass it through a 
sieve and cook rapidly; part of the gravy is poured over 
the roast and the remainder served in a gravy boat. 

Instead of the carrots, onions and breadcrUst, a 
piece of honeycake is frequently taken to thicken the 
gravy, and where possible use a thin meat broth instead 
of the water. If one wishes to impart a gamey flavor 
to a sour roast, roast it in pork fat with a, few juniper 
berries with a medium Are until half done, add plenty of 
chopped onions and a pint of thick sour cream and then 
roast until done, basting often. Skim the fat off the 
gravy, stir into the latter a cupful of milk and b'ing to 
the table in a gravy boat. 

10. riilan Roast. Lay a piece of beef weighing 
about 6—7 pounds in wine and vinegar half and half 
for 2 days ; this liquor is afterwards poured boiling hot 
over the roast ; lard and salt the meat, line the roast- 
ing pan with slices of fat pork, ham, onions, turnips and 



Beef. 101 

veal ; lay the meat on these, pour over it 2% tablespoon- 
f uls of melted butter and roast for 1 hour in the oven. 
Then gradually add 1 glassful of Portwine, % glassful of 
the pickle and a large cupful of boiling meat broth; 
leave the roast in the oven until tender, which will take 
1% hours longer. A full half hour before serving cook 
about 10 tablespoonfuls of rice quite tender, but keep 
the grains whole, stir through it the whipped yolks' of 
2 eggs and about 1 dozen finely chopped steamed mush- 
rooms, and put where it will keep hot. When the roast 
is done cut it into slices, lay them in the form of a 
wreath in the dish on a layer of rice, put a border of rice 
around the meat and drip a little of the gravy on it. 
The gravy is made from the drippings of the roast, 
which are passed through a sieve, thickened with a little 
rice flour and seasoned with extract of beef and % tea- 
spoonful of mushroom extract. 

11. Beef prepared like a Hare Roast. The tender- 
loin is the best for the purpose, but a piece of the round 
weighing about 4 — 5 pounds, the same as is taken for 
steaks, can also be used. In the Summer let it lay from 
2 to 3 days, according to the temperature, in the Winter 
from 5 to 6 days ; wash and pound, as directed in No. 1, 
until quite tender, press it back to its original form and 
lard it (3 rows) like a hare. Then sprinkle witb-fine salt, 
let it brown all around in plenty of butter, add a cupful 
of fresh milk and repeat this as often as the gravy, which 
should be of a lignt brown color, thickens too much. 
Cover the meat tightly and let it roast slowly but unin- 
terruptedly, basting often, until tender, which will take 
about 2 hours. About 1 quart of milk will be necessary ; 
stir 1 teaspoonful of flour with the first cupful of milk 
to prevent curdling. 

12. To warm left=over Roast Beef. In order that a 
warmed-over roast should taste as good as when fresh 
the warming must be properly done. Heating the 
roast over an open fire or on the hot stove is decidedly 
objectionable; a warmed roast must never cook, be- 
cause that makes it tough ; always warm it in a double 
boiler.. Put the meat into the inset whole Or cut into 



sncggTcover it with the gravy , which can be eSBHyTIT 
creased if too scanfi' by Tiie i adaT?3on of some cornstarch 



102 . D.— Meats. 

and dissolved extract of beef with a piece of butter, and 
then let it remain on the stove for % — 1 hour according 
to the quantity of meat, keeping the kettle well co vered. 

13. Round of Beef. For a rib roast weighing about 
24 to 28 pounds from which the ribs have been removed, 
take 1 pound- of coarse salt, %, pound of brown sugar, % 
ounce of cloves, 1 ounce of ground cloves, 1 cupful of 
brown syrup and 1 tablespoonful of pulverized salt- 
petre, mix well together and rub the beef with it all 
over, then roll it very compactly, tieing it closely with a 
cord. Let it lay for -4 weeks in a large vessel, which 
should be preferably of wood; turn it daily, and pour 
over it the liquor which runs from it. When ready to 
cook put it on the Are, cover with boiling water and 
some of its own liquor, cover tightly and cook slowly 
and uninterruptedly for 4 hours, afterwards leaving it 
in the broth for % hour longer. In Bremen it is served 
with sourkrout, puree of peas covered with fried onions 
or brown cabbage and fried potatoes." 

Remark.— This kind of roast can be kept for a long time and is very nice 
When eaten cold and even the remnants can be made over into palatable dishes, 
such as round of beef omelets, round of beef puffs with potatoes, etc. 

14. Beef stewed in Beer. Take a piece of beef weigh- 
ing about 8 pounds and from 2 days to a week old, 
according to the season, pound it thoroughly and sprin- 
kle with salt. Line the kettle with a few slices of fatpork, 
2 onions, 1 carrot, bay leaves and whole spices, put on 
this the meat and pour in enough water and beer (which 
should not be bitter) half and half to cover it, add a 
cupful of vinegar, 1 spoonful of pear sauce or syrup, 
cover tightly and let it cook slowly for 3 hours. When 
ready to serve take off the fat, brown some flour in 
butter and add it to the gravy, strain and serve with 
the roast. 

15. Roast Beef with Dressing. Take the kernel of 
a beef joint and stew it until done, but not too tender, 
in meat broth and white wine half and half, adding 
some spices, a bay leaf and various soup herbs, let it 
cool and cut a slice from the top. Then carefully hollow- 
it out, leaving the walls of the meat about % of an inch 
thick. Heat it in the broth, chop the meat taken out 
of the hollow together with mushrooms very fine, mix 



Beef. 108 

with a batter of 6 eggs, finely chopped herbs and 2 
spoonfuls of broth, and fill this dressing into the beef. 
Cook the broth of the meat until thick, finishing it with 
flour browned in butter and strengthen it, if necessary, 
with extract of beef and Madeira ; pour a part of this 
gravy over the meat (which has been covered with the 
slice first cut from it) garnishing it with small boiled 
onions; serve the rest of the gravy separately with 
macaroni. 

16. Beefsteaks. The best steaks are prepared from 
a beef tenderloin which has been exposed to the air for 
a few days. Next to this in quality is the sirloin taken 
from a young animal ; be particular not to have the 
slices too thin, they should be at least % to 1 inch thick. 
Pound the meat slightly with a beefsteak pounder, trim 
nicely and dip in clear melted butter. When ready to 
cook, brown some butter in a pan, put in the'meat and 
set it on a rather strong fire, leaving the pan uncovered; 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and fry on both sides from 
1 to 2 minutes, according to the thickness of the slices. 
Pour melted butter over them and serve. 

Another and entirely different method of preparing 
beefsteak is as follows : The slices should be fully % of an 
inch thick ; they are pounded and brushed with water in 
which onions have been soaked for 1 hour, sprinkle with 
pepper and salt, lay the slices tightly one on the other 
and set aside for 2 hours in a cool place; get a frying- 
pan hot, put in the steaks side by side without any fat, 
and fry for 4 minutes, turning them constantly. After 
this put in the butter and during the time it is brown- 
ing each steak is covered with a plain fried egg and 
afterwards garnished with mushrooms stewed in butter. 
Serve with the browned butter in a gravy boat. This 
makes exceedingly tender and juicy steaks. 

In England the steaks are taken with as much fat 

minutes before serving, they are then set over a glowing 
coal fire, sprinkled with salt and pepper and broiled for 
a jew minutes longer, They should be rare. Put on the 
pfatter with a pat of nice fresh butter on each slice, and 
pour a little of the j uice over them . 

Beefsteak can be served in various ways — either 



104 D.— Meats. 

covered with plain fried eggs, sliced onions fried in but- 
ter or garnished with sliced pickles, fried potatoes, etc. 
It is very nice when covered with fried oysters. In Eng- 
land beefsteak is served without gravy but with mus- 
tard or mushroom catsup. . In France beefsteaks are 
garnished with olives or served with an olive gravy. 

17. Beefsteak chopped. If it is impossible to obtain 
good steak proceed as follows : Take a pound of clear 
lean beef and about 2% ounces of solid kidney suet which 
is cut into cubes, removing the skin and sinews, chop 
both together very fine, make up into 4—5 pats about 
% inch thick and sprinkle on both sides with pepper and 
salt. Brown a piece of butter, or butter and fat half 
and half, in a f ryingpan, put in the patties, brown them 
nicely, moving them about with a fork frequently with- 
out piercing them, turn them over and fry to a nice 
brown. They should fry for a few minutes only and be 
slightly rare. Serve at once, pouring a little water into 
the pan and stirring the gravy until it has thickened 
somewhat and then put it into a gravy boat. 

18. Raw Beefsteak. Chop good tender beefsteak 
very fine, mix with plenty of salt, finely "chopped onions, 
pepper and the yolks of raw eggs, or else chop with salt 
and onions and mix with coarse ground pepper. Or 
else mix 1 pound of finely chopped meat with 3 beaten 
eggs, some vinegar, olive oil, pepper and salt, form into 
little patties, cover them with chopped onions and serve 
with mustard. Some prefer chopped beefsteak with but 
little pepper and salt, nicely rounded, creased with a 
knife and with depressions in the center; into this 
depression carefully put the yolk of a raw egg and gar- 
nish the patties with dots of chopped onions, capers, 
sliced pickles and rolled anchovies, serving with vinegar, 
oil and mustard. 

19. Stewed Beef. Take a piece, weighing from 2 
pounds upwards, of not too fresh beef from the round. 
Pound it as directed in No. 1 until it is tender. Sprinkle 
with pepper and not too much salt, turn it in flour and 
let it simmer with plenty of hot butter or fresh hot kid- 
ney suet for % of an hour in a small iron kettle, keeping 
the kettle covered tightly. . 



Beep. 105 

Then add enough boiling water to not quite half 
cover the meat, immediately put on the cover again and 
then simmer for %—l hour longer. Serve the meat in 
its own gravy with "boiled potatoes. If the gravy should 
be too scant add a little water, and it can also be thick- 
ened with cornstarch if necessary. 

20. Escallops with Jlustard Sauce. Make the escal- 
lops the same as beefsteaks made from chopped meat. 
When they are served make a sauce of 1 spoonful of 
mustard, 1 spoonful of sour cream and a little cold 
water, and pour it over the escallops. Instead of the 
water it is better to take meat remnants and make a 
meat broth and use? it in preparing the sauce. 

21. Brown Ragout of small Beef Dumplings. Make 
dumplings as directed under 0, No. 5. At the same 
time get a piece of butter very hot, stew in the butter a 
number of chopped onions, lightly brown a proportion- 
ate quantity of flour in it and stir with bouillon or 
water to a thick gravy and strengthen this with roast ' 
meat, or other left-over dark gravy. Season with pep- 
per and dill according to taste. The dumplings should 
be nicely moulded with a tablespoon and cooked for 5 
minutes in meat broth or salted water (which can also 
be used for the gravy), until they are done; put them 
into the ragout and serve with boiled potatoes. 

22. Goulash (an Hungarian Dish). Cut a tender- 
loin of beef into slices and divide these into smaller 
pieces. For each 2 pounds of beef take % pound of fat 
pork and a few small onions, cutting both into cubes, 
and lightly brown them. Put the meat on a quick fire, 
together with the browned fat and onions, and stew 
until the juice has nearly all been cooked away, then 
add salt, coarse ground pepper and a little finely ground 
cayenne pepper; stir well together and serve very hot. 

Another way of preparing goulash is to take a piece 
of rib roast, carefully remove all sinews and cut the 
meat into cubes. Melt 2% ounces of beef marrow for. 
every 2 pounds of meat and get it hot. Put in the 
meat and the necessary salt, cover tightly and sim- 
mer for 20 minutes. Then add not quite a pint of boil- 
ing bouillon and stew until quite tender, cut 2 ounces 
of fat pork and 2 large onions into small cubes, try out 



106 D— Meats. 

the fat and stir with 3 spoonfuls of cold bouillon and 
some cracker crumbs and strain. As soon as the meat 
is done add the pork fat and onions, flavor with capsi- 
cum and serve very hot with salted potatoes. 

For that matter, goulash can be made from various 
kinds of meat and is then equally as palatable as when 
made from beef. 

23. Spanish Fricco. Take a tenderloin or other 
juicy piece of beef, pound it slowly until tender, cut 
it into cubes weighing about % ounce each and mix 
through them fine salt and cayenne pepper. In the 
meantime cook potatoes with salt until done, cut them 
into slices of medium thickness, keeping them hot. For . 
.each pound of meat take two pounds of potatoes. Line 
the bottom of a kettle having a tight cover with plenty 
of butter, then put in a layer of potatoes, some more 
butter, a layer of meat and a layer of finely chopped 
onions which have first been stewed— not roasted or 
fried — in butter; continue in this manner and then cover 
the kettle tightly and put it on a slow fire at first. As 
soon as the contents begin to roast stir very carefully 
and then have a stronger fire. In the meantime stir a 
spoonful of cornstarch with 1 large cupful of thick sour 
cream and a small cupful of claret and set aside; after 
stirring the meat carefully several times and it has 
turned to a grayish color, the sauce is poured over it. 
After the sauce has been well cooked with the rest, the 
fricco is brought to the table in' a well warmed dish 
without any extras. 

This dish is generally preferred highly seasoned, but 
this of course should be regulated according to the taste 
of your guests. 

24. Breakfast Stew ("Pickelsteiner Fleisch"). Take 
a large parsley root, a carrot of the same size, a celery 
root, a large green leek and 4 medium sized potatoes, 
wash them very carefully, scrape or peel them, rinse in 
cold water and cut into fine slices. Cut 1 pound of # beef 
tenderloin into very thin slices and mix everything well 
together, adding salt and ground pepper. Heat in an 
open pan % pound of fresh beef marrow or butter, put in 
the meat and vegetables and fry until of an amber 
color, turning often, cover the pan and let it simmer on 



Beef. 107 

top of the stove for 15 — 30 minutes or until done. 
Serve with, wheat bread . 

25. Breakfast Stew, No. 2. Take beef tenderloin 
and chop it very fine or cut into cubes. In the mean- 
time fry sliced onions in butter lightly, put in the meat 
with pepper and salt, stir it for a few minutes on the fire 
and serve. For each pound of tenderloin take 4 large 
onions. 

26. Ox Tongue Brown Ragout. As tongues easily 
become tainted they must be used when quite fresh. Cut 
away the bone and the yellow spongy meat, rub the 
tongue with salt and a little water, then wash until the 
water remains clear;, cook until tender in a small kettle 
with not too much water and a little salt, skimming 
carefully; this will take from 2 — 3% hours. The tongue 
is thoroughly done as soon as it can easily be pierced 
withafork. After the tongue is cooked, take off theskin, 

" cut it into slices about an inch wide, dividing the larger 
pieces in two again. For the rest proceed as directed 
under D, 183, or stew the tongue with a thick raisin 
sauce; it can also be prepared with plenty of onions, 
like "Hasenpfeffer" (ragout of hare). For 12 persons 1 
large ox tongue will suffice. 

27. White Fricassee of Tongue. After the tongue is 
cooked as directed above and cut into slices, melt plenty 
of butter, brown in it 1 large finely chopped onion and 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour, add to it some of the tongue 
broth and, according to taste, some mace; also fine 
ground pepper and if judged best % glassful of white 
wine ; put in the tongue when the broth' begins to boil. 
After it has cooked slowly for % of an hour (it should 
not become too soft) serve with small round meat 
dumplings which have been cooked in water or some of 
the tongue broth. Strain the gravy, which should not 
be too thick, stir the yolk of an egg through it over the 
tongue, and garnish with lemon slices. 

The fricassee can be given a flavor of anchovy or 
capers, or mushrooms can be cooked in it; the latter 
should then be prepared as directed in A, No. 34. 

Remark.— If one wishes to prepare this dish for a large dinner party, it may- 
be done the day previous, without hesitation. It is then necessary to put it in the 
oven for i'/£ hours in an old tureen with » cover. Or else heat it with boiling 
water in a double kettle ; it need not then be stirred, neither is the yolk of the egg 
added until the dish is sent to the table. 



108 D.— Meats. 

28. Fried Tongue as a side dish. After the tongue 
has been cooked until tender and peeled -as described 
under No. 26, it should be split in two. Then sprinkle 
with fine salt, and a very little fine ground cloves. Or else 
rub it with a mixture of chopped eschalots, tarragon, 
sage, salt, nutmeg and cloves, turn it in egg and cracker 
crumbs, and then fry it in butter to a light brown, being 
careful that it retains its full juiciness. Fried tongue 
can also be served with an anchovy-, caper-, Madeira- 
or tomato sauce. 

29. Sliced Tongue (a nice side dish). The "tongue 
should be cooked until very tender, peeled, cut into 
slices % inch thick, cutting the largest pieces in two once 
more. Then whip an egg with 2 — 3 tablespoonfuls of 
water to which a little lemon juice may be added with 
advantage, put in some nutmeg, fine salt if necessary, 
dip the tongue slices into this, turn them in stale bread 
crumbs and fry in melted butter in an open pan over a 
quick fire until light brown and crisp. 

30. Salted Tongue for Sandwiches or as a side dish. 

Clean a heavy beef tongue as directed under No. 26, and 
rub it with 4 ounces of salt after it has been rubbed all 
over with a little saltpetre. Sprinkle a little of the salt 
into a stone jar, put in the tongue, sprinkle the rest of 
the salt over it and let it stand in this pickle in a cool 
place for 6 to 8 days in the Summer, or a fortnight in 
the Winter, turning it daily. Before serving the tongue 
it should be cooked in boiling water a few days pre- 
viously; cook uninterruptedly until it is so tender that 
it can easily be pierced with a fork, which will take about 
3^hours. Then take off the skin and put thetpngueinto 
thecold broth, into which it should be returned every time 
after it is cut, thus retaining its juiciness to thelast slice. 
If the tongue is to be kept during the Winter for any 
length of time, the broth should be heated again after 
the elapse of about 1 week. 

31. Fried chopped Beef. To every 4 pounds of clear 
beef take 1 pound of kidney suet, add some salt, and 
chop together very fine, mould into round flat cakes, 
turn them in an egg mixed with cloves, ground black 
pepper or grated nutmeg, dredge with grated crackers 
and fry in melted butter similar to beefsteak. 



Beep. 109 

32. "Charles X." Pound a piece of lean but juicy 
beef, take off the skin, lard it, then put it into the oven 
with water and vinegar half and half, plenty of season- 
ing (particularly onions) and a little garlic, some butter 
and leave it in the oven partly roasting and partly 
cooking until it is done, basting often and being careful 
not to pierce it. Let the meat stand over night, chop 
plenty of eschalots very fine, mix them with pepper, salt 
and grated wheat bread ; cut the meat into slices, brush 
an egg over them, turn in the mixture and then fry in a 
pan like cutlets. 

33. Pried Meat Loaf made from fresh Meat. No. 1. 
This is very nice and palatable when made with beef, veal 
and medium fat pork in equal parts finely chopped 
together, and then taking 3 tablespoonfuls of butter to 
each 1% pounds of chopped meat. When these meats are 
not to be obtained take iy 2 pounds of beef from the 
joint and % pound of kidney suet or fresh pork fat and 
chop them together very fine, add 4 whole eggs, salt 
according to taste, nutmeg, 2 ounces of grated wheat- 
bread or cracker crumbs, and 1 cupful of cold water. 
Mix well together, mould with the hands into a smooth 
round or oblong loaf, dredge with rolled crackers and 
crease with a knife. Have some hot butter ready, put 
in the loaf and bake in the oven until light brown, 
basting often; when possible pour over-it from time to 
time a few spoonfuls of thick cream and then bake for 
% — 1 hour to a light brown color. If the oven should 
not be hot enough, the meat can first be fried on top of 
the stove for % hour, keeping the pan covered and then 
put it in the oven ; the meat should not be turned. 
Before serving, a few pulverized juniper berries can be 
sprinkled over the meat. 

34. Heat Loaf, No. 2. To 1% pounds of chopped 
lean beef free" from skin or sinews add % pound of 
chopped kidney suet, about 6 ounces of stale wheat 
bread without "the crust, which has been soaked in cold 
water and pressed dry in a napkin, 3 eggs (slightly 
frothing the whites) about % ounce of salt and % of a 
nutmeg. Mix well together, mould nicely round and 
smooth and turn in the toasted and grated crust of 
the bread. Then put a good-sized piece of butter into 
an earthenware vessel and melt it, adding about 12 to 



110 - D.— Meats. 

15 chopped iresh jumper berries, . put in the meat, cover 
tightly and after a little while put the vessel on the 
stove with a very .slow fire; turn and lift the meat fre- 
quently to prevent it from scorching. As soon as 
browned on the under side turn once, roasting in all 
about 1 hour. 

35. Hasty Meat Balls. From the quantity of meat 
directed in the preceding receipt, make 9 small balls; 
bread them, put into hot butter and fry on the stove all 
around for a few minutes, so that they do not become 
dry. Juniper berries can also be put into the butter if 
desired. 

36. Stewed fleat Loaf. Prepare as directed in both 
preceding receipts. After browning in plenty of butter, 
pour in enough boiling water to barely half «over the 
weat, add a few lemon slices, a parsley root, and 2 slips 
of mace to the gravy and then cook, tightly covered, 
for % hour. Then add a little browned flour to the 
gravy, cook thoroughly and stir the yolk of an egg 
through it. 

Instead of making 1 large loaf the meat can be 
rolled into balls the size of a hen's egg, and then pro- 
ceed as above, which will make a very nice- fricassee. 
The balls, however, must be on the fire no longer than 
about 10 minutes ; take them off as soon as they, are no 
longer rare in the center. 

Serve with potatoes. 

37. Meat Balls made from roast or boiled fleat Rem- 
nants. Chop the meat remnants with an onion or pars- 
ley very finely, stir with it a few eggs, salt, a trifle of 
cloves or nutmeg, grated bread browned in butter and 
such meat broth or gravy that happens to be left over, 
or instead of this sour cream and a little grated lemon 
peel.- Mould into balls the size of an egg, turn them in 
the toasted and grated crusts of the bread, and then fry 
in the butter. If you have any boiled ham handy, chop 
some of it with the meat and then take less butter. In 
place of the wheat bread cold boiled potatoes -can be 
used, first grating them. ' 

38. Small Forcemeat Balls. After chopping meat 
remnants of all kinds together with some ham very fine, 
mix with chopped onions stewed in butter, a few eggs, 



Beef. Ill 

salt, pepper, nutmeg and some grated bread. In the 
meantime make a few thin omelets, spread one side with 
the forcemeat, roll them up, cut them into oblique slices 
and fry in plenty of butter after spreading an egg over 
them and sprinkling with bread or cracker crumbs. If 
your meat should be scant mix what you have with the 
omelet batter and make up into balls. 

39. Beef au Gratia. A deep pan is buttered and 
lined with a mixture of grated bread, chopped mush- 
rooms, a few eschalots, parsley and spices. Dip sliced 
beef remnants into melted butter or pork. fat and put 
them into the pan. Sprinkle the remainder of the sea- 
soning on top, put on pats of butter and pour over all 
% cupful of salted beef extract bouillon into which 4 eggs 
have been beaten. Sprinkle according to taste with 
grated cheese and then bake for 30 minutes. Serve with 
potatoes. 

40. Beef Roll. Pound a piece of beef taken from 
the upper round, which should not be too fresh. Cut it 
into oblong slices which should again be pounded with 
a meat pounder (not with a knife), sprinkle sparingly 
with a mixture of fine salt, cloves and pepper, or else 
with a few ground juniper berries. Put on some thin 
pork slices and roll into small tight rolls tied with a 
thread. The rolls are much improved when spread with 
the following mixture : Pass a number of yolks of hard 
boiled eggs through a sieve, stir with the yolk of a raw 
egg, 2 spoonfuls of tomato pulp (or sour cream), a little 
chopped parsley and a grated eschalot with pepper and 
salt, and spread this on the rolls before putting on the 
pork slices. Melt plenty of butter in a medium sized 
saucepan, turn the rolls in flour, put them into the pan 
closely side by side, cover tightly and let them fry 
slowly in their own juice as long as possible. After the 
elapse of 5 minutes turn them. Then pour in from the 
side enough boiling water to fully half cover the rolls, 
and let them simmer slowly on top of the stove with a 
low fire for not longer than % of an hour at the most, 
because frying the rolls for too long a time with too hot 
a fire makes them dry. Then cut the threads and re- 
move them and serve the rolls with a good thick brown 
gravy.

41. A crusted piece of boiled Soup Meat. Take a 
good piece of beef and make a soup ; after the meat is 
done put it into a saucepan, add a few spoonfuls of soup 
fat, 2 onions and 3 bay leaves,, sprinkle the meat with 
salt, nutmeg and grated crackers and bake in a hot 
oven until of a golden brown. Or if any of the soup 
stock is left the meat can be covered with a few eggs and 
rice, seasoned with grated cheese and then proceed as 
above directed. Serve with an anchovy-, caper-, or 
mushroom sauce. 

42. Stewed Soup Meat served with Potatoes after 
the Soup. Put the soup meat on the fire a little earlier 
than usual and after it is tender cut it into small pieces, 
melt some butter and lightly brown this also, stirring 
constantly, and take some of the soup stock and make 
plenty of rich thick gravy, which is to be seasoned with 
a few cloves, some bay leaves and pepper; add the 
necessary salt and 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of thick sour 
or sweet cream. Let the meat simmer in the sauce for % 
hour over a slow fire and when serving put in a few 
drops of lemon juice. 

43. Soup Meat Cutlets. Cut the meat remnants into 
slices, lay them into vinegar over night, turn in egg, 
salt and nutmeg, dredge with rolled crackers and fry 
lightly in butter. 

44. Irish Stew made of Roast Heat Remnants. A 

rare piece is the best for this purpose and the sinews 
should be carefully removed from it; cut into small 
cubes and for each plateful of meat take 2 platef uls of 
sliced raw potatoes, % plateful of onions, pepper, salt, a 
little ground cloves, mix well together and cook in soup 
stock, shaking frequently until done. The kettle should 
be buttered and then make the broth from the bones of 
the roast with water and whatever gravy is left; cover 
the kettle tightly. 

45. Irish Stew No. 2. Turn the meat slices in soup 
fat mixed with a little stock and then turn them in a 
mixture of grated bread, finely chopped onions, parsley, 
pepper and salt. Th§n heat some good fat in a sauce- 

Ean, put in the slices with a dot of butter on each and 
ake in the oven to a light brown. In the meantime 
make a mustard sauce as directed in Division K. When

serving and not before, put the sauce into the dish with 
the baked slices of meat and then serve after the soup. 

46. Soup Heat Salad. See Division Q. 

47. Hash. Cook a fat piece of beef until tender in 
salted water, skim well, take out all ihe bones and chop. 
At the same time boil for 1% pounds of meat % of a 
pound of rice and then cook it with the meat broth 
until thick and tender, lightly brown some butter and 
stir the meat, rice, ground cloves, nutmeg and the 
necessary salt with it. Let it simmer until done and 
serve hot. Instead of the rice, good fresh oatmeal 
soaked in water can be cooked in meat broth until 
thick. Stale grated wheat bread cooked in the broth is 
also good and especially recommended if the broth is to 
be used for a soup. This kind of hash tastes very good 
with apple sauce. 

48. Hash made from Soup Heat or Remnants of 
Roast. Chop the meat very flue and cook some rice, 
barley or oatmeal in water with a small piece of butter 
or good fat and salt until tender and thick ; then brown 
plenty of butter and kidney suet half and half, turn the 
meat in this or else in some left-over roast meat gravy 
and afterwards let it simmer until done in the rice with 
seasoning as above. 

49. Left=over Soup Meat with Onions. Cut the meat 
into thick slices with the fat; put the salt into the water, 
pour it over the meat and turn so that it will absorb 
the water. Heat some butter or fat in a saucepan,' add 
plenty of chopped onions and brown them lightly, put 
in the meat, cover and cook, turning it once. Put it 
into the dish, brown some flour in a pan, stir some 
water or meat broth to a scant, thick gravy and pour 
this over the meat. 

50. Left=over Soup Meat stewed with Apples. Cut 

the meat into thin slices, put the fat pieces in the bot- 
tom of a small kettle and the rest on top of them, 
sprinkle with salt and a few cloves, cover and simmer, 
reel some sour apples, take out the cores, slice, cover 
the meat with them, pour a few tablespoonfuls of water 
in from the side, cook the apples until done and serve 
without stirring. 



114 D— Meats. 

51. The same with a Raisin Sauce. Make a raisin 
sauce as described under Division R, cut the meat into 
small pieces and cook slowly in this sauce for % hour. 
The meat can also be prepared with caper-, mushroom-, 
anchovy-, pickle-, mustard- or onion sauce, which are all 
described in Division R. 

52. Soup Heat Ragout. Cut the meat into small 
pieces, melt roast meat fat or butter, lightly brown in 
it 1 — 2 chopped onions, and, according to the quantity, 
1 — 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, add bouillon or water with 
roast meat gravy, some pepper and cloves or else 
ground cloves, 2—4 bay leaves and some sliced pickles. 
Cook the latter until tender and let the meat simmer 
for a short time in the gravy, which should be of a good 
consistency. If liked better sweet, add a teaspoonful of 
syrup or pear sauce. 

53. Heat Fritters ("Dominikaner=Schnitte"). Besides 
the soup meat remnants a lighter-colored meat, as pork 
or veal, is necessary. Both kinds are cut into large 
slices of a uniform size; on each slice of beef spread 
some forcemeat made of 3 ounces of grated wheat bread, 
1% ounces of Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
chopped herbs, the same quantity of anchovy butter, 
3 eggs, lemon peel, salt and pepper, and lay the lighter 
colored meat on this. Put butter into a saucepan and 
lay in the fritters with alternately a light and a dark 
slice to the top, sprinkle over them hot melted butter 
and % glassful of Madeira, cover tightly and heat 
through and through. Serve neatly, garnishing the 
border of the dish with lemon slices and parsley, pour 
the sauce over the meat and bring to the table with 
potato salad or lettuce ; if with the latter, small potato 
dumplings should also be served. 

54. Meat Cream. Chop soup meat with a freshened 
herring (a few anchovies are better) and onions and 
some parsley. Let the meat simmer for a few minutes 
in melted fat, then stir with it a few spoonfuls of capers H 
2. eggs, 2 spoonfuls of sour cream, 1 spoonful of claret, 
salt, pepper and grated wheat bread to a jellylike con- 
sistency, stew in unsalted butter for 15 minutes and 
serve with mashed potatoes or boiled rice. 



Beef. 115 

55. Meat Pudding a la Zurich. (A good Dish made 
from Remnants for the Supper Table.) Mix with 1 

?ound of chopped meat 3 ounces of chopped pork fat, 
tablespoonful of fine herbs, 2 spoonfuls of capers, a 
chopped pickle, salt, pepper and four eggs, mould in a 
round pan or other vessel and cook for % hour in a 
double kettle. Leave itover nightand the next day turn 
it .out of the mould and serve with a brown or Remou- 
lade sauce. It can also be covered with meat jelly and 
is then served with olive oil, vinegar and mustard. 

56. Fried Sour Roll (see Division W). Cut the roll 
into slices % inch thick, and if they are wanted particu- 
larly nice, turn them in egg and cracker crumbs, then 
fry them in hot butter or hot kidney suet together with 
a few apple slices to a light brown color. 

Or else each .slice can be covered with a spoonful of 
griddlecake batter, and then fry the apple slices alone. 

The roll is very good when the slices are stewed for 
about 10 minutes in a claret sauce. 

57. Fried flinced Collops (German "Panhas"). This 
is a very economical and palatable dish for the family 
table, and can be prepared at any time (see Division W) 
taking beef as well as pork ; soup meat or tough roast 
will answer, but then plenty of fat pork should be 
chopped with it. When cooked long enough panhas 
can be keptin the Summer for a week when put in a cool 
place, and in the Winter for 2 weeks, and will then be 
very often found to come in handy when a dish is lack- 
ing for the table. After it is cooked it is fried as follows: 
Heat some butter or good fat in a frying pan, cut the 
loaf into slices about \ inch thick, put them into the 
frying pan close together and let them fry uncovered on 
both sides until crisp; they should not become dry. 
Serve with potato dishes of various kinds, especially 
with potatoes-and apples. 

58. How to cook Pickled Beef. If the meat has 
simply been pickled with salt freshen it over night or 
for a few hours, according to its saltiness; then put it 
on the stove covered with cold water, and cook slowly 
for 3 hours. If water is added while it is cooking it 
must be hot. Meat which has been pickled in brine with 



116 D.— Meats. 

spices and herbs is put on the fire in boiling water with 
the addition of a little salt, and then be careful that the 
cooking is not 'interrupted nor continued too long, 
otherwise the meat will receive an insipid taste. 

Remark.— The broth will make a nice barley soup with potatoes or a bean 
or pea soup and all Fall and Winter vegetables can be cooked with it nicely. 

59. How to cook Smoked Beef. It should be well 
washed the evening before cooking; this is done best 
with a clean whiskbroom and a handful of wheat bran ; 
then soak over night in water, rinse it again the follow- 
ing day, put it on the fire covered with boiling water 
and cbqk slowly for 2 — 4 hours. After it is done it can 
remain in its own broth for % hour longer, keeping the 
kettle covered ; this makes the meat more tender and 
juicier. 

Remark.— This broth can also be used for the same purposes as in the pre- 
ceding receipt. But to have the remainder of the meat retain its juiciness put it 
in an open tureen with the broth and set it.into a cool place ; it may be necessary 
to heat the broth again after a few days. 

60. Smoked Tongue. Soak the tongue for 24 hours, 
cook it the same as smoked beef, then put it under a 
little slab or something similar with a weight on it ; 
after it has cooled take off the skin and keep it until 
wanted in the broth in which it was cooked. Pressing 
the tongue gives it a better form. Serve in slices and 
garnish with parsley. It is very nice when served with 
fresh peas, kohlrabi, spinach, or for sandwiches. 



61. Ribs of Beef for Invalids. Take out the bones 
and remove the fat and sinews, pound the meat and 
then fry it in butter for 10 minutes,, turning frequently 
and sprinkle with salt and pepper; make a sauce, tak- 
ing for this purpose the bones and sinews for a broth 
and mix through it flour lightly browned in butter and 
a glassful of Madeira. 

Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 16, 17, 27, 28 and 29 may also 
be served to invalids. 



Veal. 11? 

II. VEAL. 

Note. — A good roa&t can only be expected if the 
meat is continually basted; adding water or meat 
broth must be absolutely avoided, neither must the. 
meat be pounded — veal is too tender for pounding and 
it only makes it stringy. A perfect roast should be fin- 
ished with sweet or sour cream, but this must be added 
not sooner than % hour before serving. 

62. Roast Leg or Loin of Veal. After preparing the 
veal for the stove, heat plenty of butter in the pan and 
if you have any nice fat pork handy, put in a few slices 
and on these the veal with the round part to the top. 
Put it into a hot oven and roast it for 1% hours with a 
strong fire at first, which should gradually decrease ; 
baste often but do not turn the roast. A small roast 
should not be kept in the oven longer than 1% hours, 
otherwise it will become soft and dry; to prevent the 
gravy from becoming dark or scorching, put in a piece 
of butter occasionally. 

The gravv w ill receive a nice a mber color and be im- 
proved in taste by the a ddition o f 1 — 2 cupfuls of cream ._ 
After the roast has been" taken "out of the pan pour in" 
the cream, let it turn to a rich yellow color, stir up 
everything remaining in the pan with boiling water and 
let it cook for a few minutes longer to a rather thin 
gravy; the cream will give it the proper consistency. 
Should you have no cream a half tablespoonful of flour 
may be browned with the roast and add some weak 
broth orwater to make the gravy, which should always 
be strained before it is served. 

If the gravy'is to be seasoned with mushrooms, 
they should be stewed in butter quickly and then added 
to the gravy. 

63. Roast Neck of Veal. Take the best end of the 
neck of a calf, cut off the ribs on both sides to half their 
length and take out the kidneys, peel off the skin and 
lard the meat like a hare; roast in the oven with a 
medium fire, with plenty of fat pork and butter, from 
1—1% hours until done. Salt is not sprinkled over the 
meat untjl it has been in the oven for % of an hour. 
When nearly done cover the roast with thick sour 
cream. 



118 I>.— Meats. 

The gravy is made as directed in the preceding re- 
ceipt. Serve the meat either with a salad or a compot, 
or else macaroni mixed with butter and Parmesan 
cheese are served with the meat. 

64. Veal Kettle Roast. Wash and dry the roast. 
Melt butter and fat in the kettle and add a few slices 
of fat pork if desired. Then put in the meat, and roast 
uncovered until partly done, moving it about in the 
kettle, being careful not to pierce it. Gradually pour in 
a few half cupfuls of cream, cover the kettle tightly and 
proceed as directed for veal roasted in the oven, basting 
frequently. The round side should lie to the top. 

65. flinced Kidneys with Roast Veal. Chop the 
roasted kidneys with their fat very fine, lightly brown a 
chopped onion in butter and cook the kidneys with salt, 
nutmeg, a tablespoonful of sour cream and % table- 
spoonful of mustard until done • serve to the roast with 
toast. 

66. Stuffed Breast of Veal. Take out the breast 
bone (it is best to let the butcher do this), wash and dry 
the meat, with a knife enlarge all round the opening left 
through the removal of the bone, being careful not to 
puncture the outer skin, and fill with the dressing A, No. 
27, or a dressing made of "wheat bread ; take a needle 
and thread and close the opening, rub the meat with a 
little salt, put it on a strong fire with plenty of butter, 
which can be mixed with good fat. Roast for 1% — 3 
hours, according to the size of the piece, basting fre-s 

Juently and gradually adding some strong bouillon. 
>o not neglect removing the threads when serving. 
Stir some cold water into the gravy and cook it until of 
the proper consistency. Breast of veal prepared in this 
manner is very nice when served cold for the supper 
table. 

After removing the threads brush the meat with the 
gravy which will, when cool, make a brown jelly. The 
cold roast should be brought to the table with a Ravi- 
gote Sauce (see Division R). 

67. Stewed Breast of Veal. For a middle course, 
stewed instead of stuffed breast of veal is often pre- 
ferred. After it has been stiffened in hot water it should 



Teal. 119 

be larded, slightly roasted in butter, then pour in some 
meat broth and add mushrooms and parsley root. 
Thicken the gravy with grated bread, flavor with lemon 
juice and pour it over the meat before serving. In first- 
class kitchens this breast of veal is surrounded with 
truffles and small baked chicken croquettes, finishing 
with a border of mashed potatoes. For the family 
table any suitable large piece from the breast can be 
stewed without the mushrooms. 

68. Fricandeau of Veal. Kaisfr the flesh of the finer 
part of the loin clear from i he bones, pound and lard it 
as for a hare. Sprinkle with lemon juice, dredge with 
flour, melt plenty of butter in a pan, put in the meat 
with the larded side to the top, together with an onion 
and parsley root. The oven must be hot enough to 
soon lightly color the lardoons. After this sprinkle 
with fine salt and then roast the fricandeau, basting 
often, for % — % of an hour until done. If the fricandeaus 
are intended for a dinner party, bring them to the 
table with a Madeira-, truffle- or herb sauce, surround 
them with a border of boiled rice, or serve with roasted 
potatoes. Fricandeaus sliced make an excellent garnish 
for a dish of fine vegetables. 

If the fricandeau is to be stewed, cook a brown 
broth from the rest of the meat together with soup 
herbs, and spices, pepper, ground cloves, onions and a 
bay leaf and strain. As soon as the fricandeaus are 
nearly done, pour in alarge cupful of the broth, close the 
oven and afterwards baste them once; serve with the 
gravy which has been bound with a little flour browned 
in the* pan with the broth. After straining the gravy, a 
few lemon slices may be added to it. Truffles cooked 
with this dish improve it very much. 

Time of cooking, 1%—1% hours. 

69. Hunter's Fricandeau of Veal. Take a piece from 
the loin, pound it well until it has the appearance of a 
beefsteak about 2 inches thick. Then make a batter of 
6 — 8 eggs whipped with 8 spoonfuls of sweet cream, salt 
and a little nutmeg, mix with 3 ounces of chopped ham 
and a few finely chopped mushrooms, spread this mix- 
ture over the meat, then roll it and tie pieces of fat pork 
around it. Bake the fricandeau in melted butter in the 



120 D.— Meats. 

oven for about % hour until done; make a sauce taking 
some meat broth, lemon juice, cornstarch and a spoon- 
ful of Portwine, and pour it over the meat, which is 
served with small round roasted potatoes. 

70. Veal Kidney Fritters. Chop a veal kidney with 
1 to 2 roasted sweetbreads or a small piece of veal very 
fine, adding grated lemon peel and nutmeg. Melt a 
piece of butter, add a little chopped onion and after- 
wards a trifle of rolled cracker, and when this has been 
well browned, with constant stirring, put in the roast 
veal jelly and also the juice of a lemon, and cook it to 
make a thick ragout gravy. When cool, mix into the 
gravy a few eggs, the chopped meat and the necessary 
salt; mould into small oblong fritters, turn in egg and 
cracker crumbs and fry in butter to a light brown color. 
The fritters can be garnished with minced parsley fried 
in butter, and served with various kinds of vegetables, 
such as carrots, peas, cauliflowers, asparagus or arti- 
chokes. 

71. Sweetbread Fritters (Entree). Scald veal sweet- 
breads and slice them thin; chop eschalots and ancho- 
vies very fine and stew the onions in butter. Then cook 
the sweetbread, anchovies, wine, salt and either mace or 
nutmeg, some grated wheat bread and, according to 
the amount of the dish, 2—4 eggs and a few tablespoon- 
fuls of roast beef gravy, meat jelly or milk, until of a 
fine consistency, stirring. constantly. Instead of the 
anchovies and eschalots, crab butter or crab tails can 
be used. Let the mass stand over night and mould it 
into oblong rolls the next morning. Turn these" twice 
in a beaten egg; sprinkle with cracker crumbs and fry 
over a quick fire in enough butter or fat to swim the 
fritters. Garnish the dish with fried or fresh minced 
parsley. 

72. Stewed Ribs of Veal. Take a very good piece 
of meat, trim out the ribs smoothly, pound thoroughly 
without separating them, so that they will be about 
% inch thick, and then cut them down to about half 
their length. Line a pan thickly with butter, put in the 
ribs, sprinkle with salt and nutmeg, and add butter, 
lemon slices, cracker crumbs, and to 3 pounds of meat 



Veal. 121 

about 1 large cupful of wipe and water half and half. 
Cover tightly, lay a damp cloth over the lid and stew 
for 15 minutes. 

73. Vienna Veal Steak ("Wiener=Schnitzel"). Cut 

pieces the size ofasmall beefsteak from the center of*ar 
loin of veal, flf^ffff 3 iB^jfflJlfbr ru b with line salt ana" 
pepper; turn them first Tn egg and flour, then in rolled 
crackers an d fry in' plenty o f butter u ntir tenter? When 
serving, sprinkle "the steaks with lemon juice, garnish 
with lemon slices and a few capers and serve with a 
lattice of anchovy slices and a plain fried egg. 

74. Veal Cutlets. Loosen the meat at the bone 
and then pound it slowly until tender,,chop off the bone 
to half its length and cut the meat round and smooth 
to the thickness of a finger; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Dip the cutlets in egg, turn them in bread or 
cracker crumbs (in South Germany the crumbs are 
mixed with grated Parmesan cheese), and then lay them 
in the pan in melted butter. Fry for about 6 minutes 
in the open pan, turning them once, frequently basting 
them with the butter. Fry until of a golden brown and 
tender. Serve with fresh vegetables, such as peas, aspar- 
agus and cauliflowers. In the Winter they are very 
nice when served with macaroni mixed with a few table- 
spoonfuls of tomato sauce. 

Cutlets can also be served as a middle course, but 
then they should be larded with pork lardoons, or else 
with lardoons of tongue, anchovy, truffles, or pickles; 
they can be pickled for a few hours in white wine spiced 
with fine herbs. They are then brought to the table 
with a fine sauce, for which the marinade is partly 
used. 

Veal cutlets can also be broiled like mutton chops. 
The scraps from the cutlets can be used for the sauce oi 
an ordinary ragout or for headcheese. 

75. Veal Stew or Fricassee. A breast of veal should 
be well pounded and cut into small squares, and in 
order that the meat may look very white it should be 
blanched by laying the pieces into nearly boiling water, 
then bring to a boil once, afterwards putting them' in 
the cold water and drying them. Then heat some 
butter in a kettle, put in the meat and let it simmer 



122 D.— Meats. 

slowly for 15 minutes, turning once, keeping the kettle 
covered but being careful thatthe meat does not brown. 
Pour in enough boiling water to make the requisite 
quantity of sauce, add salt, parsley root and some 
salsify, cut into 2-inch lengths and add mushrooms 
if desired; cover tightly and cook slowly until tender 
but not too soft; this will take about 1% hours. 15 
minutes before serving, the following can be added: 
Sweetbreads, parboiled asparagus tips, small sausages, 
a few lemon slices, mace, and to bind the sauce, rolled 
crackers. When serving stir the yolk of an egg through 
the sauce ; a glassful of white wine can also be cooked 
in it to advantage. Bring to the table with crab-, meat- 
or bread dumplings which have been cooked in salted 
water, and pour the sauce over them . This kind of veal 
stew can be varied in many ways; the sauce can be 
seasoned with anchovy butter, the sweetbreads may be 
omitted and instead of them, sweetbread dumplings (see 
DivisionO) can be substituted, or else it may be brought 
to the table with a border of boiled rice or puff paste. 
For the family table all the fancy ingredients may be 
omitted and only bread dumplings and cauliflower buds, 
in the Spring bits of asparagus, in the Winter salsify 
or chervil roots, and when all these are lacking, quart- 
ered celery roots may simply be put with it. 

76. Paprican (an Hungarian Dish) can be prepared 
from veal, as well as from pigeons or Spring chickens. 
Divide the meat into small pieces, if veal, about the size 
of a small walnut, Spring chickens into 10 parts, and 
pigeons into 4 parts. Heat plenty of fat with a finely 
chopped onion, put in the meat, sprinkle some salt over 
it and cover the kettle tightly. After the meat has 
browned on a slow fire, which should be the case after it 
has cooked an hour, stir through it, without turning 
the meat, a heaping tablespoonful of flour and add beef 
extract bouillon and some sour cream. When cooked 
the sauce must be of a good consistency. Serve in a hot 
dish with boiled or crusted potatoes. 

77. Stuffed Veal Roll. Cut from the loin aboul 
4 pounds of meat and divide it into medium-sized slices. 
Stew the scraps of the meat in butter chopped finely 
with lemon peel, season with ]i pound of anchovy and 



Veal. 123 

make up into a forcemeat by adding 3—4 eggs ? some 
wheat bread and a little cream or milk. Spread the 
forcemeat over the meat slices, roll them up, tie with a 
thread and fry slowly. For the gravy take the broth 
from the roast, about 1 ounce of mushrooms, a little 
cornstarch or rice flour and simmer the meat in this for 
a short time longer. These rolls can be pickled in vine- 
gar and spices for a time, they are then slightly fried in 
fat and afterwards stewed slowly until done. Cut them 
in two lengthwise and either surround a fine ragout — as 
for instance one made from veal sweetbreads and mush- 
rooms — with them, or use as a border for a dish of fine 
vegetables. 

78. Calf's=Brain Ragout. "Wash the brain, bring it 
to a boil in water with a few onions, cloves, pepper, 
vinegar and salt, then take off the fine skin and also 
remove the veins: Then brown a tablespoonful of flour 
in butter, stir in some broth and put in the brain, (which 
has been cut into pieces) together with a few lemon slices 
and some wine. Cook for -a little while and stir into the 
sauce the yolks of 1 or 2 eggs. 

79. English Calfs-Head or Mock Turtle Ragout, 
(enough for 20 Persons). Take a fresh calf's head, wash, 
singe and cook it, together with 2 beef palates, in 
salted water long enough to clear it from scum, and 
then cook with onions or eschalots, cloves, peppercorns, 
and a few bay leaves for 2 —2% hours until done. The 
beef palates should be cooked for at least 2 hours before- 
hand, so that they will be done simultaneously with the 
calf's head. Cut the meat into small'-pieces, add % pound 
of veal sweetbreads, (A, No. 35) meat dumplings, % 
pound of small sausages, which should be previously 
fried; if possible also add % of a roasted' hare. Then 
brown flour in butter, stir with it a good beef bouillon 

. cooked with a few vegetables and eschalots and put in 
the meat, togethtrwith mushrooms, capers, lemon slices, 
ground pepper, whole and ground cloves, a pinch of 
cayenne pepper and % bottle of Madeira, cooking until 
the sauce is of the proper consistency. 

When served with puff paste sippets this ragout is 
an excellent substitute for a meat pie ; in fact, if filled 
into a pie crust it will make a good meat pie.

80. Veal Sweetbreads. Prepare them as directed 
in A, 35, divide into two pieces, lard and season with 
salt and nutmeg, then fry in hot butter to an amber 
color and serve with fine vegetables. Or else parboil 
the sweetbreads, slice them, turn in egg, nutmeg, a little 
salt and cracker crumbs, bake in butter and after 
sprinkling them with lemon juice, use as a garnish for 
fine vegetables. Or boil in broth for 15 minutes, cut 
them up and serve in gravies or stews. Sweetbreads, 
must always be thoroughly cooked or fried. 

81. Boiled Calf's-Head with Gravy. Clean a fresh 
large calf's head very carefully, cut off the upper ljp, 
ears, and take out the. eyes, break off the lower jaw, 
take out the tongue, because it will become tender 
sooner, then wash out the head, split it and'tie it 
together again. Cover with water, add salt, skin, and 
cook with whole spices, fresh herbs-, onions and bay" 
leaves until tender, which will take about 2 houi's. Leave 
in the broth until ready to serve, then put into the dish 
and cover the brain with bread crumbs browned in 
butter, split the tongue and lay if on both sides of the 
brain, make a Hollandaise sauce (see Divison R), put 
some of it over the meat and bring the rest to the table 
in a gravy boat. 

It is much nicer to cook this meat in white wine and 
thin meat broth half and half instead of water ; instead 
of serving the entire head the meat can be sliced and 
brought to the table with some fine broth or Hol- 
landaise sauce, laying around it the tongue slices and 
bits of the brain scooped with a teaspoon. The gravy 
is served separately. 

For the supper table this dish is served with a 
French sauce of mustard, olive oil, vinegar and savory 
herbs. 

82. Baked Calf's=Head. After cooking a fresh calf's- 
head as described in the preceding receipt, the meat is

one-half with water and vinegar, add salt and skim 
carefully. For the rest proceed as directed for pork 
brawn in Division W. 

84. Brown Calf's-Head Ragout for the Family Table. 

Cook a calf's head, the heart and if liked the lungs until 
quite tender., and then cut up into small pieces. Brown 
2 chopped onions in butter, add 2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour and stir until it is also brown, put in some of the 
broth in which the head was cooked, add raisins or dried 
currants, pepper, cloves and Rait, 1 — 2 tablespoonfuls of 
pear sauce or syrup and some vinegar, and cook until 
the meat is thoroughly well done. The gravy rhust be 
smooth and have a tart, spicy flavor. 

85. Escallops for 6 persons. Take a pound of veal 
and if this is not obtainable, beef may be substituted, 
chop as finely as possible with % pound of pork fat or 
freshened kidney suet, then mix thoroughly with % pound 
of wheat bread (without the crust) soaked in cold water 
and pressed, the yolks of 2 eggs and a little salt and 
pepper, and then mould into flat escallops the size of a 
silver, dollar; fry in plenty of fat with a quick fire, 
taking them out as soon as they have turned yellow. 
Then brown a spoonful of flour in the fat, add chives, 
parsley, etc., about a handful in all, also bouillon and a 
little sour cream to make a rather thick sauce, which is 
poured boiling hot over the escallops. 

Escallops can also be made from rib roast, chopping 
the meat very finely and moulding the escallops without 
any other addition, add the necessary salt, then turn 
the escallops in an egg and grated cracker crumbs and 
bake. The sauce is cooked with sour cream only and 
the escallops served with fine vegetables. 

86. Veal Rolls. Chop 1 pound of veal very fine with 
3 — 4 ounces of beef marrow, mix with salt, pepper,,- 
nutmeg and a few eggs, rolling the mass between thin 
slices of fat pork, tieing them with a thread; put the 
rolls into a medium-sized vessel, pour meat broth over 
them, stew until done and before serving cover with a 
caper sauce.

87. Veal Forcemeat Sausage. (A Swiss Dish.) 4 

parts of clear veal without sinews or veins are finely 
chopped with 1 part of pork fat or kidney suet; for 
each 2 pounds of this meat take 4 whole eggs, 4 table- 
spoonfuls of bread or cracker crumbs, 4 tablespoonfuls 
thick cream or wine, salt and nutmeg, mix well together 
and fill into a sausage stuffer or else roll into small

cracker crumbs. Melt some butter in a flat pan, put in 
the mass in the form of a tightly rolled-up sausage, 
moisten with melted butter, sprinkle a little fine bread 
crumbs over it and bake in a hot oven. 

88. Stewed Liver. The liver must be very fresh, 
because even if only one day old during the hot season, 
it may become tainted and unwholesome 5 wash the 
liver, which is best done by putting it into cold water 
for 1 hour and changing the water frequently. Take 
off the skin, and lard as follows: A large number of 
short slips of, fart pork are turned in a mixture of salt, 
pepper and ground cloves, then take a sharp knife and 
gash the liver and insert the lardoons. Afterwards melt 
a good-sized piece of butter and let the liver simmer in 
ft for 15 minutes, keeping it covered tightly ; then half 
cover it with boiling water, add % plateful of finely 
chopped onions, 2 bay leaves, a little more salt, ground 
cloves, and a piece of butter, and when the liver is

heated butter and fat pork for 10 minutes until crisp, 
turning once. If the liver is fried too long it will be- 
uome dry. 



Veal. 127 

When blood no longer appears if the liver is pierced 
with a fork, it is done and must be taken from the Are. 
Immediately pour a cupful of water into the pan, stir 
until it is properly thick and pour it over the liver. 

A few fresh pounded juniper berries can be added to 
the hot btitter according to taste ; they impart a nice 
flavor to the liver.

the meat a few eggs of which the whites have been 
slightly frothed, together with some nutmeg and salt. 
Then roll into the form of sausages, brush with egg, 
turn in cracker crumbs and fry in butter to a light 
brown. This makes a nice side dish for all kinds of fresh 
vegetables, particularly spinach. 

93. Meat Balls made from Boiled Veal and fried in 
Lard. Cut boiled veal into small cubes, brown flour in 
butter, add some bouillon and water, but not too much, 
because the sauce should be thick, together with salt 
and lemon peel, stir the yolk of an egg through it, then 
cook the meat in it thoroughly and put it into a dish to 
cool. Beat an egg with some salt and turn in it the 
meat balls which have been formed from the cold mass, 
then turn them in cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard to 
a light brown and send to the table. Garnish with 
slips of celery which have been fried in the hot lard.

III. MUTTON. 



Note. — Inasmuch as mutton fat cools very rapidly,. 
all dishes in which mutton is to De served, and also the 
pla£fisJon the table, must be warmed. 

102. Saddle or Leg of Hutton prepared like Game. 

For a dinner party the saddle is usually taken; if the 
leg is chosen it is chopped off smoothly to about % its 
length and not cut in two at the point like a leg of veal. 



130 D.— Meats. 

r 

Wash the saddle and pound it thoroughly, put it into 
an appropriate vessel together with plenty of onions 
and eschalots, bay leaves, cloves and peppercorns, gar- 
den-rue, majorani, tarragon, 1 quart of vinegar, and, if 
you have any heavy claret, a bottleful, this giving the 
meat the brown color. 

Pour this liquor boiling hot over the meat and let 
it remain in it for 8 days, turning it daily. Instead of 
preparing the mutton as above it can be laid in sour 
milk only, on else a day before using and after it is 
skinned rub it with the following essence, which will 
impart an excellent gamey flavor to the meat: Put 2 
grated onions, purslane, chives, chopped thyme, ground 
spices and pounded juniper beriies into 2 glassfuls of 
claret and let it draw for a few days, strain through a 
sieve and brush the roast all over with it from time to 
time, until it is all used up. Then lard the roast like a 
hare, sprinkle with fine salt and put it into a pan in 
which plenty of fat pork and butter has previously been 
heated, and roast until light brown. Afterwards grad- 
ually pour either some of the vinegar in which the meat 
has lain, together with the herbs, over the roast, or else 
gradually some sour cream; and then roast until tender, 
basting often and keeping it covered, at least during 
the earlier part of the time it is in the oven ; according 
to the size of the roast and whether it is to be rare or 
well done, this will take from 1% to 2 hours. During 
the last hour gradually stir 2 cupfuls of thick cream 
into the gravy and let the roast finish, uncovered, to a 
golden brown, basting often. When serving rub % table- 
spoonful of flour in a pan for a few minutes until brown, 
add enough water to make the gravy and then strain it, 
The roast may be garnished with either small potato 
dumplings or with a border of stewed onions; mush- 
rooms are also very nice for this purpose. 

» For a middlecourse at a dinner party the piece from 
the saddle over the tenderloin is often taken only ; lard, 
stew in the oven with meat broth, parsley root, etc., or 
with claret, until tender, and when done drip off until 
dry and glaze with the broth which has been made in 
the oven. Then slice the meat and serve it as a garnish 
for a fine veal sweetbread ragout, or mushroom ragout, 
or even to good bouillon rice, which has been well shaken

boiling water — if the meat is to have a slightly sour 
flavor, take 1 part of vinegar to 3 parts of water; 
season with eschalots or onions, some bay leaves, cloves 
and pepper and sprinkle with flue salt. If fresh cucum- 
bers are to be had cut % plateful into cubes and put 
them into the pan at once, which will greatly improve 
the flavor and appearance of the gravy. Roast for 3 
hours, basting often ; it is best to cover tightly. An 
hour before serving gradually add 2 cupfuls of either 
cream or milk to the gravy. If no vinegar has been 
used, a spoonful of mustard can be stirred into it at 
last. To prepare thesauce proceed generally as directed 
under No. 1. 

104. Stewed Leg of Hutton. The meat, which should 
not be too fresh, is well pounded and put on the Are 
with water and white ("Weiss") beer, which must not 
be bitter; skim and add cloves, peppercorns, 3 bay 
leaves, a few whole onions, and a bunch of green herbs, 
such as garden-rue, majoram, and sweet basil, let it- 
cook slowly for 2 hours, keeping it covered tightly. 
Then pour off the broth, sprinkle the meat with fine 
salt, dredge a spoonful of flour over it, put in some 
butter and brown the meat on both sides, moving it 
back and forth to prevent scorching. Take the fat from 
the broth, strain the latter and put it into the kettle, 
add lemon slices without the seeds, pickles sliced length- 
wise, or_ fresh cucumbers, a cupful of vinegar, a handful 
of button onions and a glassful of claret. Stew until

I nstead o f the ground cloves a few juniper ber ries 
may be put into the butter. ' " ' 

Take the fat off the gravy and bind the latter with 
cornstarch, adding either % cupful of sour cream or % 
glassful of Madeira. If the lamb is a very small one, 
both legs can remain together; bend them inwards after 
they are larded, tying them with a cord. 

106. Saddle of Lamb rcasted like Venison. Take 
the saddle of a Spring lamb, remove the skin, and rub 
thoroughly all over with the following mixture: escha- 
lots, majoram, rosemary, and 2 to 3 bay leaves, all

pounded juniper berries. Then add vinegar and claret 
half and half and let the meat lay in this for 3—4 days, 
turning it in the pickle frequently] It is then larded if 
wished and roasted in an earthenware or enamelled pan 
for 1 to 1% hours, sprinkling fine salt over it and bast- 
ing often. * 

107. Mutton and Lamb Chops are prepared like 
veal cutlets, taking off all of the fat. When serving, a 
bit of anchovy or vegetable butter can be put on each- 
chop. Lamb chops can also be served with tomato 
sauce and mixed with pickles. When served cold they 
should be covered like stuffed breast of veal, with a 
thick brown gravy. 

108. Broiled Mutton Chops. Trim the chops nicely, 
remove the fat, dip in melted butter, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper and with cracker crumbs, which are often

the fricassee slowly for two hours, but do not get it too 
soft, skim off the fat, lightly brown a spoonful of flour 
and stir it through the fricassee, cook slowly for 10 
minutes longer and serve. 

111. Fricassee of Lamb with Capers and Anchovy.

while, then add a little boiling water, salt, cover and 
cook slowly. When nearly done, which will be after 
about 1 hour, add flour smoothed (not browned) in 
butter, lemon slices without the seeds, capers and some 
wine, stir finely chopped anchovy through the fricassee - 
just before serving, because cooking impairstheir flavor.

and anchovy, in fact this is preferred by many. 

1 12. riutton Ragout. Wash the meat, cut it into 
, small squares, put it on the fire in boiling water with 

salt and season with bay leaves, peppercorns, cloves, 
onions, and if agreeable, "a little dill ; for a large quan-

meat with this until quite half done, take off the fat 
from the broth, strain the latter and bring it to a boil 
with flour rubbed in butter, and then put in the meat 
with a few lemon slices without the seeds, button onions, 
pickles or fresh cucumbers (if the latter, add a little 
vinegar), and cook until done. The meat must be easily 
pierced with a fork, but it should not fall to pieces, 
and the sauce be neither too thin nor too thick. 

The ragout may also be prepared wholly like brown 
ragout of hare ("Hasenpfeffer"). 

It can also be improved by the addition of mush- 
rooms, stewed onions, veal sweetbreads, kidneys or fowl 
livers; the gravy can be spiced with claret and the 
ragout brought to the table in a puff paste or sur- 
rounded with bits of toast. A border of boiled rice is

a spoonful of cornstarch smoothed in Madeira,^strain, 
and if permitted mix with it a few spoonfuls of tomato 
pulp.

IV. TAflE HARES OR RABBITS. 

118. Note.— Although the value of tame hares or 
rabbits as articles of food has long been recognized, it is 
only of late years that particular attention has been 
paid to raising them. They are now so frequently to 
be found in -most kitchens, however, that a separate 
chapter of this book may be profitably devoted to a 
description of the various modes of preparing them for 
the table. 

- Killing the hare is accomplished in the easiest man- 
ner as follows: Insert a sharp knife into the neck, be- 
tween the forelegs, this will pierce the heart and kill the 
animal without any struggle. In order to have the flesh 
retain a light color, which is desirable in the preparation 
of so-called white dishes, and also in order that it may 
keep longer, let all blood drip away. Catch the blood 
in a dish containing a little vinegar and set it aside in a 
cool place; it is used for brown hare ragout ("Kanin- 
chenpfeffer"). After being killed the skin of the hare 
should be immediately taken off and it must also be 
emptied. Tame hares are skinned in the same manner 
as wild ones (see No. 156) and they are also cut up the 
same as these. 

119. English Hare Soup. Cut the meat into very 
small pieces, melt some butter and brown the meat 
in this lightly together with 6 onions with a«love in each, 
stirring carefully ; then add a heaping tablespoonful of 
flour and shortly afterwards meat broth or water, a 
small parsley root cut into pieces, 2~bay leaves, 1 table- 
spoonful of black peppercorns, and salt. The onions and 
spices are taken out before serving. After the meat is 
tender the broth is strained, brought on the fire again 
and then cook enough sago in it to bind the soup. 

A piece of finely chopped raw meat together with 
some wheat bread soaked in cold water, butter, egg 
and mace, prepared like beef dumplings, can also be 



136 D.— Meats. 

cooked in the soup for a few minutes. The liver of the 
hare is frequently cooked in the soup ; after it is done it 
is chopped fine, passed through a strainer and mixed 
with a small glassful of Portwine, salt and pepper and 
made up into little dumplings for the soup. Most other 
soup dumplings are also suitable for hare soup. 

120. Fresh Roasted Hare. For the various kinds 
of hare roasts the large kinds are the most suitable; 
the hare should be full grown but quite young ; when a 
little older they are better adapted for brown ragout of 
hare, and when old they should be used for soups. 

Cut off the head, neck, breast and forelegs, remove 
the skin, wash the saddle and lard, or else lay a few 
slices of fat pork on it. Sprinkle with fine salt, put the 
roast into a hot pan containing plenty of melted butter 
and a few slices of fresh bacon and addatablespoonful of 
mustard. Baste frequently and as soon as the meat 
begins to turn yellow it is best to add sour cream and 
continue the roasting with a slow fire, basting often. 
As soon as the roast can be readily pierced with a fork, 
and has a dark yellow color, which will be after half an 
hour or so, according to the age of the hare, it should 
be put on a hot dish, stir what is left in the pan with 
% tablespoonful of flour and cook with salt and water 
to a well bound gravy, pour part of this over the roast 
and bring the remainder to the table in a gravy dish. 

Apple sauce is the most suitable accompaniment. 

121. Roasted Tame Hare like Wild Hare. Lay the 

saddle of a large hare into an earthenware vessel =for 
3 days in a pickle made as follows: 1 large cupful of 
vinegar, 1 large cupful of claret, 4 medium-sized chopped 
onions, 1 heaping teaspoonful of fresh coarsely pounded 
juniper berries, 1 teaspoonful of pounded peppercorns, 
3 bay leaves and a little bunch of thyme. Drench the 
meat three times daily with this liquor and also turn it 
once a day. Lard the meat, salt, and roast with the 
addition of sour cream. 

This mode of preparing a hare can be well recom- 
mended, and it may be observed that every dish of hare 
will gain in flavor, if first pickled for a few hours. 

Pear sauce, com pot of apples and cranberries are 
suitable accompaniments. 



Tame Hares or Rabbits. 137 

122. Brown Ragout of Hare ("Kaninchenpfeffer"). 

When killing the hare catch the blood in a dish contain- 
ing some vinegar,' as already noted, and set it aside. 
Cut the meat into pieces and put with it the heart, lungs 
and liver, put it into a rather narrow vessel and cover 
it fully one-half with vinegar which has been boiled with 
a few bay leaves, plenty of peppercorns and cloves. In 
order that the meat may be thoroughly penetrated by 
this liquor, it should lay in it for 3 days at least and be 
turned once a day. Then melt a piece of butter (for the 
sake of economy pork fat cut into cubes can be taken) 
brown it in a handful of finely chopped onions, stirring 
constantly, then also stir through it a heaping table- 
spoonful of flour to a light brown, and add the liquor in 
which the meat was pickled, together with salt and 
enough water to make the necessary amount of gravy; 
should through this the gravy be too sour, however, do 
not put in all of the vinegar. Cook until the meat can 
be readily pierced with a fork, but not too tender, then 
stir in the blood of the hare without any further cook- 
ing; add a piece of sugar to give the gravy a sweet-sour 
taste. The gravy must have a nice consistency. Serve 
with hot boiled potatoes. 

123. Fricassee of Hare (White Ragout). Cut the 

hare into good-sized pieces, laying aside the head, neck 
lungs and liver. Wash the meat, lightly brown a heap- 
ing spoonful of flour with a piece of butter, put in the 
meat together with salt and 2 finely chopped onions, 
and simmer on both sides for a while. Then add as 
much boiling water as is wanted to make the gravy, 
put in some mushrooms if possible, and cook, until' 
tender. If the gravy should not be thick enough, this 
can be remedied by putting in a very finely rolled 
cracker; a little finely grated nutmeg will improve the 
flavor of the gravy. 

If dumplings are wanted in the fricassee, make them 
of the meat of the hare or from beef, or else from beef 
marrow, and in serving the fricassee mix them between 
and around it. ,

V. PORK. 

Note. — Pork does not need to .hang: for any length 
of time to become tender, nor need it be pounded. The 
slightest taint renders it unfit for use. 

124. To bake a whole Ham. After cutting away 
the. bone and point from the ham of a young pig, rub 
with salt, put it into a small crock and pour over it hot 
vinegar in which have been boiled a handful of chopped 
eschalots or onions, a little tarragon, a spoonful of 
peppercorns, a teaspoonful of cloves and 3 bay leaves, 
let it lay in this for a week ; if it is only one-half covered 
it should be drenched and turned daily. If a small piece 
only is to be baked, the spices should be taken in pro- 
portion. If the ham is to be boiled, put it on the fire 
with half of the liquor and about 1 or 2 quarts of 
water, with the skin to the top, cover tightly and boil 
until almost tender. Then pour off all of the broth and 
strain it; put a piece of butter into the pan and either 
take a sharp knife and criss-cross the skin of the ham 
and insert a clove in the corner of each little square, 



or else take off the skin and thickly dredge the h am with 

lVit'h flntmeg, I 
ered"in"alfoT oven until quite tender and brown, gradu 



finely rolled crackers mixed Vit'h nutmeg, bake uncov- 



ally add the liquor, % cupful at a time. Baste the sides 
of the ham frequently but with care, so that the upper 
crust will become crisp. When serving, take part of the 
fat from the gravy, put into it a heaping spoonful of 
flour, stir for a few minutes, make up as much grayy as 
is wanted and put in a few lemon slices. 

The ham can be garnished as follows": Boil several 
celery roots in salted water until half done, slice length- 
wise and cook them not too tender in the ham broth 
before the latter is poured off. Set aside until ready to 
serve, and when the gravy is done, simmer the celery in 
this f6r a few moments, and use to garnish the dish. 

To cook a whole ham will take abo ut 3 hours. , 

125. Fresh Loin of Pork with a Crust (Mecklenburg 

Style). Take off the skin and rinse the meat withhold 
water, point with cloves at intervals of 3 inches, sprinkle 
with salt and put into the oven in a pan containing 
water ; the oven should not be too hot at first, other-

wise the meat will be roasted on the outside while the 
inner part remains rare. Baste frequently and add 
boiling water as often as is necessary. When done, 
which can be ascertained by piercing the side of the 
meat with a fork, skim off the fat from the broth and 
then dredge the skinned side with a mixture of grated 
bread crust, sugar and some finely ground cloves; put 
the meat back into the oveu and leave it there without 
basting until the crust is crisp. 

Time of roasting, at least 3 hours. 

126. To prepare a Ham like Wild Boar. Take from 
a young pig a ham weighing about 8 to 10 pounds, 
remove the skin and rub the meat well with the follow- 
ing mixture: 1 pint of claret, 1 large cupful of vinegar, 
some sugar, 2 large grated onions, 6 bay leaves, ground 
pepper, whole and ground clOves, a teaspoonful of each, 
30 fresh juniper berries, the chopped peel of half a lemon 
and a little ginger. Then put the ham into this liquor 
and leave itinthe same for afewdays, drenching itdaily 
Sprinkle with salt, put it into a pan with butter and let 
it brown lightly, add a few cupfuls of boiling water and 
some of the liquor. Then roast until tender for 2—2% 
hours, basting frequently; an earthenware or enameled 
pan is the best. 1 hour before serving put 2 cupfuls of 
cream into the gravy, which is thickened with a little 
flour before serving, after taking off part of the fat as 
directed in No. 124. 

127. Roast Pork. A cut from the neck ha s the 
mildest meat and is the most profitable on" account of 
the small bones it containX**TfSTRe**Best when taken 
from a young pig and cut towards the middle in such a 
manner that it is covered with a thin layer of fat. 

The roasting can be done in a kettle as well as in 
the oven. The fat on the meat is usually sufficient to 
finish the roast, or some of it may be cut away if found 
necessary. > Put some water into the pan, sprinkle salt 
over the roast, and leave it in the oven covered tightly 
until* done, turning it once. The oven should have a 
medium heat only ; according to the size of the piece — 
say from 3 to 5 pounds,— it will take from 2 to 2% hours 
to finish the roast- Baste frequently with the sauce, 
which has been spiced with pepper and juniper berries, 



140 D.— Meats. 

occasionally adding a little "boiling water. When . the 
roast is served skim off the superfluous fat from the 
gravy and cook the latter with the addition of a tea- 
spoonful of flour and a little water and salt, if necessary 
stirring with it all that remains in the pan. 

128. Roast Pork, No. 2. After rubbing the meat the 
evening previously with salt, pepper and' mace, put the 
kettle 011 the fire with water and enough vinegar to 
impart to it. a decided sour taste; these ^hould be 
enough of this liquor to cover the meat about one- 
third; add plenty of finely sliced onions, peppercorns, 
a few cloves and bay leaves, bring the broth to a boil 
and put in the meat, cover tightly and let it cook slowly 
until it is quite half done, turning it once. If the broth 
should then ndt be wholly cooked away it will make no 
difference— it can be poured into a separate vessel; put 
the fat back with the roast, together with a little kidney 
suet if necessary, and then keep the roast on the fire 
until it is done and of a medium brown color, adding 
from time to time a little of the broth or instead of this 
a few tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 

The gravy, which has been thickened as directed in 
the previous receipts, should be strained before it is 
served. Add 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of milk to the gravy 
if it should be too sour, provided it is brown enough. 

According to the French method, a neck of pork, 
after being salted is put in the pan with some quartered 
apples, plenty of small onions and small potatoes, 
drench the meat with melted butter, roast for 15 
minutes and then pour in a large cupful of seething hot 
water with which it simmers until done. When serving 
put the roast into the center of the dish, and place a 
wreath of apples, onions and potatoes around it. 

129. Boiled Smoked Ham. Put the ham into water 
over night and the next morning wash it thoroughly 
with hot water a nd a handful of wheat bran. R inse it 
well and put it 'on the fire with the skin to the top, 
covered with water or else in a steamer. The ham must 
be brought to a boil rapidly, afterwards, however, it 
should jSQfl& jjilpwly b ut uninterruptedly for 3%Juiub8, 
and then let it lay in the broth for J£ hour longer. A 
whole ham will be particularly excellent if it is put od 



Pork. 141 

a hot stove without cooking it the day before it is to be 
used, and then finishing the cooking the day after in the 
same broth. This makes the meat extremely tender yet 
it does not drop to pieces in the least on the outside. 
If it is to be brought to the table whole put it into a 
dish, trim all around very nicely, make a. straight cut 
through the skin about 2 inches from the end, and in 
.such a manner that it will adhere to the inner side and 
form a border all around; roll up the skin from the 
point and fasten it, (the thin piece of bone can be taken 
from the leg), roll the end of the leg into a frill of paper, 
fastening it, put a wreath of parsley around the edge of 
the dish and garnish the top of the ham with chopped 
parsley. 

130. Ham with fladeira Sauce. Boil a smoked ham 
until tender as directed in the foregoing receipt, take off 
the skin, remove all fat excepting a single narrow strip, 
then cut the ham into thin slices and put them into a 
deep dish side by side, so that the fat edges lie to the 
top, and pour over them a hot sauce made as follows: 
Take a meat broth made according to A, No. 20, brown 
1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of flour in butter, stir some of the 
broth into it, season with salt, and cook with % bottle 
of Madeira until clear. Then add truffles or mush- 
roomSj which have been prepared accordingto A, 33 and 
34. After the ham has been served in this sauce sur- 
round it with a rice border made as follows: Scald 1 
pound of rice and then cook it in water until tender 
and thick with a piece of butter and a little salt ; the 
kernels, however must remain firm. Then mix with the 
meat broth 1 cupful of Madeira, 1 cupful of cream, the 
yolks of 2 eggs, and % pound of grated Parmesan cheese 
and stir this through the rice carefully. 

Serve as hot as possible. 

131. Ham with Burgundy Sauce. Wash a well 
smoked ham and lay it into water over night, wipe it 
off carefully, put it on the fire in cold water and bring 
to a boil, after which it should simmer for 2 to 3 hours, 
rather than boil, but it should not be soft. Then take 
it out of i he broth, remove the skin with part of the fat, 
bring about 1% to 1% quarts of strong beef broth to- 
gether with a bottle of Burgundy and 1 tablespoonful 



142 D.— Meats. 

of sugar to a boil, pour this over the ham and cook 
until nicely brown and tender, basting often. Before 
serving take the fat from the gravy and strain. If you 
have no broth use extract of beef. 

132. Stuffed Spare Ribs. Take the spare ribs con- 
nected in one piece, rub well with salt, cut off the small 
bloody end, crack the ribs in the middle without injur- 
ing the meat and then fill with quartered apples or 
stewed prunes, or both mixed, bend the edges together 
and sewthem. Put the meat into boiling butter, brown 
both sides, pour in some boiling water and roast for at 
least 2% hours, keeping it covered tightly and adding a 
little boiling water from time to time; spare ribs are 
best roasted "in the oven. The meat should at first be 
only half covered with water in the pan, and roasted 
from 1 to 3 hours according.to the age of the pig from 
which it is take,n; turn once only. At the end of the 
time mentioned the water must be cooked away and 
then baste the meat quite often with the fat in the pan, 
sprinkle with a little salt and roast for % hour longer 
until nicely brown. Thicken the gravy with a little 
browned flour and some of the liquor of the stewed 
prunes. The superfluous fat is best skimmed off after 
taking out the roast, and then prepare the gravy. 

Spare ribs are frequently filled with so urkrout, which 
has first been stewed for % of an hour in butter with a 
little sugar and a glassful of white wine, after which 
boiled chestnuts or small stewed mushrooms are stirred 
through it. The roast is otherwise prepared as above 
directed, but a little wine added to the water is an 
improvement. Do not neglect to remove the threads 
before serving. 

133. Pork Headcheese. See directions in Division W. 

134. Roast Pig. The pig should be well cleaned, 
skinned and washed; cut off the feet and take out the 
eyes, rub inside with salt, dry the outside and pierce it 
lengthwise with a wooden skewer; then put it into a 
pan containing a little water and brush thoroughly 
with olive oil or a piece of fat pork. Puncture with a 
larding needle to prevent blistering. Roast pig is not 
basted like other roasts and salt is not sprinkled over 



Pork. 148 

it until it is crusted to a light brown. It is then brushed 
againlvith pork fat and after roasting fori hour, served 
hot without any gravy, putting a lemon between its 
jaws. As a side dish serve the following: First boil the 
lungs and then chop them finely together with the liver 
and the* heart and simmer in butter until it is done. 
Stew some eschalots in butter in which a spoonful of 
flour has been lightly browned, stir with some meat 
broth to a thin pulp, add salt, nutmeg, ground cloves, 
lemon juice and some chopped lemon peel and cook all 
of this until done. 

135. How to cook a smoked Pig's Head. Cover it 
over night with water, wash it off the next morning 
with warm water and then cook slowly in boiling water 
for 3 hours with the meaty side to thebottom. Is most 
appropriate with sourkrout and salted beans. 

136. Pickled Pork is cooked in the same manner as 
directed for pickled beef (D, No. 58). 

' 137. Pork Sausages. Take some nice streaky pork 
and chop it very fine, add salt, nutmeg and lemon peel 
or chopped eschalots, a few eggs, some grated wheat 
bread and a little cream. Mix well together and then 
roll between the hands into little sausages or balls, 
dredge- with cracker crumbs and fry in butter. Serve 
with spinach and most varieties of cabbage. 

138. Pork Chops should be cut from a young pig. 
Prepare like veal cutlets, but they should_fxy.slQwer.and 
2 minutes longer. They are an agreeable accompani- 
ment to all kinds of cabbages. 

139. Chopped Pork Cutlets. To make 4 cutlets take 
1 pound from the neck of a young pig, .chop it fine 
together with some salt and pepper,'divide into 4 parts, 
mould into the form of cutlets and cross-hatch the 
surface somewhat, by means of which they can be easily 
breaded. Then beat up 1 egg with a tablespoonful of 
water which will be sufficient for 6 cutlets, have ready 
plenty of grated bread crust or stale grated wheat 
bread, heat butter or kidney suet as directed in A, 17, 
dip the cutlets in egg so that they will be covered all 
over, turn them in bread crumbs and fry quickly in an 



144 D— Meats. 

open pan on both sides for a few minutes until of a light 
brown color, moving them about in the pan frequently 
so that the fat will not scorch. When done through 
and through take them from the fire at once so that 
they will retain their full juiciness. These cutlets are 
appropriatewiththefinest kinds of vegetables or potato 
dishes. A gravy made of extract of beef with capers, 
anchovy, etc., can be made for the Cutlets, sprinkling a 
few drops of lemon juice over them, or else they may be 
garnished with large apple slices stewed in butter. 

140. Smoked Raw Ham Steaks. Cut the slices 
about % inch thick and lay them in milk over night, 
which is particularly essential when the ham is very 
salty or dry; pound the slices on both sides with the 
edge of a dull knife, dip into a beaten egg with a little 
pepper, turn in bread or cracker crumbs and fry in hot 
butter in an open pan on a very moderate fire — a hot 
fire will harden the meat-; turn them quite often until 
they are of a golden brown color. 

141. Chopped Pork Steaks are prepared like chopped 
beef steaks, (see No. 17). Fry them with browned 
onions or in melted butter. 

142. Pork Tenderloin. Pound the meat slightly, 
sprinkle with a little salt, put it into the pan with 
melted butter, fry until slightly browned and then keep 
them tightly covered on a slow fire for 15 minutes 
longer, turning once. Then add some cream and fry 15 
minutes longer, basting frequently, until they are tender 
enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Before serving 
add a little flour as usual, and a few minutes after 
enough bouillon or water to make the gravy, which is 
flavored with a few lemon slices. 

143. Sv^eet-sour Ragout of Pork. A piece from the 
neck or any cut from the breast can be taken. Divide 
the meat into pieces of appropriate size, and proceed 
precisely as directed for ragout of hare ("Hasenpfeffer"). 

144. Pork Croquettes in South Germany Style. 
(Sueddeutsche Schnitzchen.) These can be made from 
any kind of meat besides pork. Chop 1 pound of tender 
fat pork very finely together with a small onion or an 
eschalot steamed in butter. Then stir with 12 freshened,

coarsely chopped capers, some ground pepper and nut- 
meg, 2 ounces of wheat bread grated without the crust, 
3 eggs and 3 tablespoonfuls of thick sour cream to a 
smooth forcemeat, make it up into cakes of a medium 
thickness about the size of a silver dollar, put into each 
a slip of parsley root to serve as a bone and fry them 
over a quick fire on both sides until brown. 

Served with the butter in which they are fried they 
are nice with fine vegetables, without the butter and -the 
parsley root they are good with bread and butter and 
tea. 

145. Fried Sausages and ApplesT Cut 6 pared apples ■ 
each into 8 pieces, sprinkle with sugar and a little cin- 
namon and let them stand' for a few hours. At the 
same time put some cleaned dried currants into luke- 
warm water and let them soak on top of the stove. 
Melt a good-sized piece of butter in the pan, put in 
% pound of sausages, lay the apples around and the 
currants and a little lemon peel over them, cover and 
fry slowly. As soon as the apples are soft underneath 
turn them, and take out those that are done to prevent 
them from dropping to pieces. As soon as the sausages 
are fried add a glassful of Rhinewine to the gravy and 
serve them garnished with the apples. 

146. To fry fresh Sausages (so-called "flettwurst"). 

If the sausage meat has been cut into cubes put it on 
the fire in a pan containing some water, cover and cook 
for % — 1 hour, then take off the cover so that any 
remaining water will steam away, put in a piece of 
butter and fry the sausages on both eides to a light 
yellow so that they will remain quite tender. Fresh 
sausages made from finely chopped meat are put into 
melted butter at once; fry for 15—20 minutes. After 
the sausage has been fried»on both sides in the melted 
butter to a light brown, beer (which- should not be 
bitter) can be added, in which the sausage is stewed 
until done. 

147. To cook smoked Pork Sausage. Smoked saus- 
age is cooked principally in browned cabbage or in pea-, 
bean-, lentil- and potato soups. . As long as it is juicy, 



146 D— Meats. 

wash it in warm water and put it on the fire in cold 
water and cook until done. If it is dry this' procedure 
will not be 'sufficient to make it tender; it must then be 
washed 2 days before cooking, covered with water and 
set aside in a cool place'. ' 

148. "Frankfurt" Sausages. These and "Wiener" 
sausages are covered with boiling water and' then set 
on top of the hot stove for 10 minutes. Serve with 
grated horse-radish. They are an a ppropriate_ ac.com- 
paniment to all cabbage dishes and to potato ~or bean 
salad. ' — — — ^ 

149. Ham Croquettes. .Take ham remnants and 
chop them very finely with some fat, and for a soup- 
plateful add 3 eggs, 2. ounces of grated wheat bread, 
3 tablespoonfuls. of cream and some pepper; mix thor- 
oughly. Soak slices of wheat, bread in milk and egg, 
cover smoothly with the meat, turn in bread and cracker 
crumbs. and fry in butter to a light brown. This is a 
very palatable dish after the soup and is also nice when 
served in a middle course, or with salads, greens or 
beansj 

, 150. Fried Slices of pickled Pork. Cut boiled pickled 
pork into slices, turn in egg and ground cloves, then in 
flour and fry in butter until of a light brown and crisp. 
Excellent with various kinds of coarser vegetables. 

151. Warmed=over Pork Remnants. 'Cut the rem- 
nants into slices. Slightly brown 2 handfuls of smalJ 

.onions in 'butter, also some flour, and cook with a 

glassful of claret, 1 cupful 6f meat broth, salt, pepper, 

bay leaves'ahd a little thyme to make a rather thick 

'sauce, in which the meat slices are thoroughly heated : 

serve with mashed potatoes.

152. Roast Pork in Packages. Cut the meat into 
slices, lay therti together two-by-two, spread top and 
bottom with butter, turn in bread crumbs and chopped 
herbs and then wrap them in strong white paper thickly 
covered with butter. Put these "packages", on the shelf 
in a hot oven for 10 minute's and then bring them to 
the table at once. Serve with potato salad and pickles 
in a separate dish.

the remnants should happen to be very dry, lay them 
in milk for a few hours, then out them into cubes and 
mix with the same quantity of asparagus pieces,. which 
have been cooked in salted water; make a thick sauce, 
taking 3 eggs, 2 teaspoonfuls of flour, 1 large cupful of 
the asparagus broth, a little lemon juice, a trifle of 
extract of beef, salt and nutmeg, mix the meat arid 
asparagus through the sauce, All into little < buttered

ation of Game. When purchasing game be careful to 
observe that the flesh has not been injured or torn 
through the killing. It should, furthermore, not be too 
old, that is to say, it should not have laid too long 
because the slightest "houtgout" will seriously impair 
the meat. . • • 

Game must never be freshened in water; the follow- 
ing rhethod, in vogue in France, has proven to be the 
most practical for cleaning game. Remove all bloody 
parts, dip -a cloth in lukgw arm wa ter and rn_h the meat 
with it aTFtrrerrT gGeat the^ rag^^yrrti^cnl d water and 
then lard or otherwise prepare the meat a*s" desired. 

The meat must be well cooked in order to bring' out 
perfectly its fine flavor. A roast must be well; horded 
(see D, II) : and the oven s hould not be overheated. 
Game is roasted in pfentrypf butter wrElrfafTp^ork and 
sour cream and frequent basting;, no water should be 
added. -—,-- -,»", — - - 

The head is the least valuable part of- all varieties 
of game, excepting the wild boar; and can only^be used 
in an ordinary ragout, like a pork ragout, and in this 
case the neck can also be used; the , tongue, . on the 
contrary, is very good. The breast, particularly if it 
has become bloody in, consequence of the , shooting, is 



148 D.—Meats. 

not an especially choice part and it is also then best for 
a ragout. Then follow the sides and joints, which, when 
from an older animal, are beststewed, and from younger 
ones are best for roasting, and . finally the buttock 
piece, which is best of all for roasts. 

155. To keep Game. A cleaned hare with its fur on 
will keep in cold weather for a week longer, but if neces- 
sary it can be put into vinegar for a few days more, 
yet this does not tend to improve it. Venison will keep 
well as follows: Divide the meat into roasts, sprinkle, 
moderately with salt, then roast very slightly all around 
in a pan. When the meat is quite cold pack it into a 
keg or a stone jar with a few onions, peppercorns, fresh 
juniper berries, a sliced lemon and some salt and pour 
enough fresh lard over the'meat to entirely surround it. 
It. will keep in good condition for a week, and can be 
either stewed or roasted and is then handled like fresh 
meat. 

156. To skin Hares. When purchasing the hare, v be 
careful to observe t ha t the saddle is not injured, other- 
wise it will Tedl'y and ofa poor quality. The forelegs 
of a young hare are easily broken and their ears can be 
readily torn, and up to their second year they have a 

Jighfc spot on the forehea d. For that matter, old hares 



are^lSo^goodwnen^F6^erly>ooked . The meat of an 
tare is more tender if it is fii 



old hare is more tender if it is firstl aid in buttermilk f or 
a few days. The skinning and preparing of a hare for a 
roast is somewhat troublesome and is done as follows : 
Usually the hare has been cleaned before it is sent 
to market, and only the liver, heart and lungs come 
with it. Lay it on a chopping board or hang it up by 
the hind legs, first on one leg and then on the other; 
the back or saddle is on the board or against the wall. 
Then with a sharp pointed knife cut the skin from the 
paws to the point where it has been opened for cleaning, 
and pull it over the stubby tail and both joints, assist- 
ing at the latter places with the knife so that none of 
ibhe meat adheres to the skin, which can now be easily 
drawn forward as far as the forelegs ; the aid of the 
knife will again be necessary when the body is reached, 
where the fat is found. Cut the paws from the forelegs, 
after which they can be easily drawn out of the skm, 



Game. 149 

which ij then pulled over the head, at the same time 
cutting off the ears. Then take the knife and remove 
the skin from around the eyes and the front part of the 
head. The bones of both hind legs are cut off at the 
pointwhere the openingwas made for cleaning the hare, 

• then slit the body as far as the breast, take out the 
liver, lungs and heart and catch the blood which has 
gathered in the cavity of the chest, in a dish containing 
a little vinegar. Cut the breast bone in two and divide 
the skin of the neck up to the head, pull out the wind- 
pipe and put the hare on the meat board to cut it up, 
separating the head from the body,at the point where it 
is joined to the saddle. Finally shorten the ribs on both 
sides of the hare enough to leave them about 1% inches 
long to protect the tender meat of the saddle when it is 
being roasted. After the hare has been washed in cold 
water several times, the inner skin should be removed 
and larding is next in order. 

Every bit of the rest of the meat together with the 
lungs and the heart must be washed very carefully, 
picking out any shot that may happen to remain in 
the flesh, but need not have the inner skin removed like 
the piece intended for the roast. If the ragout cannot 
be gotten ready at once, coyer the meat with vinegar 
so that it will keep for a while longer. The gall bag, 
which adheres to the liver and is scarcely to be distin- 
guished from it, must be removed very carefully ; fry the 
liver as fresh as possible (or after it has lain in sweet 

.milk for a few hours) in browned butter, a little flour, 
bread crumbs and, a few crushed juniper berries. It 
should not be fried for too long a time, otherwise it will 
lose its juiciness. 

157. Roast Hare. Take the entire saddle and the 
two hind legs, the remainder is used for brown ragout. 
Wash carefully, remove the inner skin from the saddle, 
and lard. Sprinkle the hare with salt and put it with 
its back to the top into an enameled pan with plenty of 
butter, cover the feet with paper and have a hot oven ; 
the heat from below should not be too intense, beeause 
otherwise the gravy will be apt to scorch. As soon as 
the roast is turned lightly brown, pour over it 1—2 cup- 
fuls of thick sour or sweet cream. Plenty of butter and 
cream and frequent basting will make the roast juicy, 



150 D.— Meats. 

so that the meat of the legs will be nearly as tender as 
that of the saddle. A young hare should not roast 
longer than % hour and older ones 1— 1% hours, and as 
soon as the meat can be easily pierced with a fori? take 
it out of the oven even if you are not quite ready to 
serve, because leaving it in the oven will make the meat 
dry. When the table is ready put the pan back into the 
oven again for about 10 minutes, bearing in mind to 
baste and- not neglecting to remove the paper when 
serving the hare. Prepare the gravy according to No. 1. 

Instead of using cream, an old hare may be pre- 
pared with good buttermilk ; after the meat has become 
lightly brown, gradually add a pint of buttermilk, and 
in this case the heat from below should be stronger so 
that the gravy will be brown. 

If it is desired that the roast hare should have a 
slightly sour taste, let it lay in vinegar for 12 hours 
previously to cooking. 

Remaek. — The preparation of a palatable soup from the remnants of a roast 
hare or its bones is described under B, No. 28. 

158. Stewed or Steamed Hare. This is the best 
method of cooking an old hare; it should first be larded, 
divided into pieces and very slightly roasted in browned 
butter, then pour the butter into a stone jar, put in the 
fat pork slices and spices,' on these the meat, sprinkle 
with salt -and pour over the whole a small cupful of 
sour cream, into which a teaspoonful of flour has been 
stirred. Then seal the cover of the jar with a strip of , 
paper thinly covered with flour smoothed in water, and 
simmer in the oven for 2 hours with a slow fire; the 
meat will become quite tender and juicy and should be 
served- in a hot dish. What remains in the jar should 
be strained, thinned with meat -broth and poured over 
the meat, which should be brought to the table with 
boiled potatoes. If the cover of the jar is perfectly 
tight, it need not be sealed as above directed. 

159. Ragout of Hare ("Hasenpfeffer"). Divide the 
forelegs and the lower part of the body into pieces, wash 
thoroughly, being careful to rinse off any hair that may 
adhere to the meat ; split the head and wash it together 
with the heart, liver and lungs. Jf the meat is to be 
preserved for a few days prior to cooking,, cover with 



Game. 151 

i 

vinegar and turn it daily. It should not be ke.pt so 
long, however, that it will have an unpleasant odor. 
When cooking, heat some pork fat* in order to econ- 
omize with your butter, brown some finely chopped 
onions in it, stirring frequently, and afterwards a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of flour, then stir in enough boiling 
water to make plenty of gravy, taking into consider- 
ation that some of it will evaporate, add salt, a few 
pounded cloves, a good-sized pinch of pepper, a few bay 
leaves, a large piece of butter and a sufficient quantity 
of the vinegar in which the meat was pickled. Cover 
tightly and cook until done, but the meat must not fall 
to pieces. Then stir in the gravy a piece of sugar, or, 
according to taste, a glassful of claret. The gravy 
should have a spicy, sweet-sour taste and be well bound 
but not too thick. Boiled potatoes are the most appro- 
priate accompaniment. 

A nicer method is to first scald the meat and to 
divide it into pieces of proper size after removing the 
bones, and then after heating the fat, very slightly 
roast the pieces together with chopped onions. Instead 
of the water use boiling meat broth and add claret to 
the gravy. ,- 

160. Roast Haunch of Venison. Pound the meat 
slightly, remove the skin and lard lengthwise in rows in 
such a manner that the larding needle is inserted be- 
tween the lardoons of each preceding row. In this man- 
ner the larding will be richer and add 'greatly to the 
juiciness of the venison, which is naturally lean and 
tender. Line the bottom of a pan with fat pork slices 
which are first roasted. Then put in the meat and roast 
until the lardoons are yellow, basting frequently with 
the pork fat ; after this cover the roast with pieces of 
butter or sour cream, salt and roast until done accord- 
ing to taste, a few finely pounded juniper berries can at 
last be sprinkled over the roast. 

Time, from 1—1%— 2 hours. 

161. Roast Loin of Venison. The loin is very sel- 
domly roasted in one whole piece; fricandeaus can be 
cut from it and larded and roasted like No. 160— orveal 
fricandeaus No. €8, not longer than 1 hour. If the 
roast should be a large one, take either the front or 



152 D— Meats. 

back part of the loin without any bones, pound it 
slightly, remove the skin, lard, and roastforlJ£— 2 hours 
according to the size of the piece and the age of the 
animal. The rest of the loin will make excellent steaks, 
or can be utilized for meat balls* etc., while the bones, 
after being split, will make a palatable brown bouillon. 
The meat taken from an animal chased to death is 
absolutely useless and unwholesome. 

Venison from older animals, especially pieces from 
the forejoints, can be pickled for a longer or shorter 
time in vinegar with onions and spices, after which it is 
larded; then stew and roast in an oven with a little 
water, or cook until almost tender and then roast in 
t^tie oven with butter or fat for % hour longer. The 
addition of sour cream always makes it more tender 
and more palatable. 

162. Ragout of Venison. The best for this purpose 
are the upper parts of the forejoints, the breast, neck 
and ribs. These pieces must be carefully examined and 
washed, especially if they are very bloody and badly 
torn through shooting. Cut the meat into pieces of 
proper size, turn them in flour, brown all round in pork 
fat and butter, pour in some salted boiling water, cover 
the kettle immediately and a few minutes later, after 
skimming, add a little lemon peel, some pepper, cloves, 
a few bay leaves, a few finely sliced onions, a few pickles 
sliced lengthwise and some vinegar. A glassful of claret 
is added later on and also a lump of partly browned 
sugar, but only enough to take off some of the acidity 
of the vinegar. The gravy must be abundant and of a 
nice consistency. Serve with roasted or boiled potatoes. 

163. Venison Chops ("Mailaender Rehrippchen"). Cut 
the chops from the saddle and prepare them like veal 
cutlets; lard on one side and salt. Slice some ripe 
tomatoes and boil to a thick pulp together with some 
chopped raw ham, finely chopped oniOns, salt, pepper 
and a piece of butter ; strain. It must be thick enough 
so that it can be served in pats ; cracker crumbs can be 
used to make it firmer if necessary. In the meantime 
boil some macaroni in salted water and mix on the fire 
with butter and Parmesan cheese; keep in a hot place 
until the cutlets are done. The cutlets are fried in 



GrAME. 158 

butter until brown, turn and put them on a hot dish, 
cook the gravy with flour browned in butter and some 
Madeira until it binds. The tomato pulp is put into 
the center of the dish, the macaroni around it in a 
wreath and on this the cutlets side by side. Serve the 
gravy in a boat. 

164. Stewed Shoulder of Venison. Cut off the shoul- 
der at the second joint of the leg, remove the skin care- 
fully, lard and put the meat into a kettle which has 
been lined with fat pork slices. Pour claret and meat 
broth over the venison and add some sweet herbs, a 
piece of ginger, some toasted bread crust, a bay leaf, 
and stew in the oven until tender. Then lay it on a hot 
dish and glaze by holding over it a ladle heated in the 
Are; surround it with a border of small potato balls 
and serve. The gravy should be strained and served in 
a boat. 

165. Game Hash. Chop very finely remnants of 
roast game ; grate a few onions, steam them in browned 
butter, add some flour, 1 spoonful of chopped parsley 
and whatever gravy is left over, taking, off the fat, and. 
cook this to a njce gravy. The chopped meat is thor- 
oughly heated but not cooked in this gravy, then add 
some lemon juice according to taste, some pepper and 
salt if necessary. Serve the hash with a border of small 
potato dumplings and cover it with button onions and 
egg slices. 

166. Game Headcheese. Take the juicy remnants 
of roast game and chop them finely, and for each 2% 
pounds of meat take 3 ounces of wheat bread soaked 
aDd pressed, 2 ounces of boned and chopped anchovy, 
a little over 2 ounces of grated eschalots browned in 
butter, a batter of 5 eggs, about 5 ounces of pork fat, 
4 ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and 
4 spoonfuls of roast meat gravy. Mix this very care- 
fully and then stir the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth 
through the mass, which is cooked for an hour in a 
buttered mould. When cold tip out of the mould and 
serve with a Remoulade sauce. 

All game dishes, with the exception of Nos. 158, 
159, 162, 165 and 166 are suitable for invalids.

VII. TAME AND WILD FOWL. 

167. Points of Difference between Old and Young 
Fowl and the best Season for purchasing. It is quite 
essential that every housekeeper be informed as to the 
points of difference between fowl that are good and 
those that are not. Of course the greatest safeguard 
against obtaining unwholesome poultry is to buy it 
when alive. Poultry in good health has clear shiny 
eyes, smooth .plumage, lively movements and bright 
red combs. When purchasing killed poultry, first exam- 
ine the place or wound where they were killed, which 
should open outwards; the skin should be white, the 
flesh firm and the bill retain its natural color.- If the 
skin has a bluish tinge or is slimy, and if the bill has 
changed color, the meat is unwholesome. 

The distinguishing points of young fowls are: A 
white, tender skin, an easily indented breast-bone, a 
hg&t-colored bill and skin of the legs , and a slender 
body. With the exception of the T urkey , which has a 
dark skin on the l egs when young, all old poultry KaS-a 
dOTKTEard, hornys^n™^BTflie-tegs. The windpipe of 
young turkeys and geese can be easily compressed and 
with pgefe a.n infallible indicatio n that they are young 
consisTs in the fact tnat Tne " head o f a pin can be 
inserted into th e skin, of the breast, wTnch c&nfi6t ''''b r e 
^one^nf^ajnSlW'gooseT' roung™wud fowls have soft 
bfflswrElTa yellowTiH'g"and light colored feet (partridges 
have yellow feet) ; the ends of the quills of the plumage 
of any young fowl are quite soft and filled with blood. 

Besides the age and wholesomeness of poultry, the 
time of the year has some influence regarding its adapt- 
ability for cooking. Young— so-called " Spring " chick- 
ens — are best from May to Novemb er, capons i n the 
Winter months and t urkeys i rom Sep tember to March, 
although the latter are the nicest in September, D&iUtu- 
ber and January. - Young pigeons are the plumpest in 
June and July. Fat-geese c an be obtained from Pel o- 
er to J anuTCTT aricl d ucks a"re in season at the beg inning 
of Novembe r. The game laws of the various States OT 
course govern the time when game can be obtained in 
the market. 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 155 

168. Preparation of Poultry. According to its kind, 
poultry should be killed one or more days before it is to 
be cooked, spring chickens and pigeons the previous 
evening, old chickens, capons, ducks and turkeys 2 days 
and geese 3—4 days beforehand. If it should be neces- 
sary, however, to cook the smaller varieties of poultry 
at once, they must be put on the fire immediately after 
being killed. Poultry intended for roast or brown 
ragout should be plucked immediately after killing and 
while the flesh is still warm, but it must be done care- 
fully so as not to injure the skin. After geese and ducks 
have been drawn and singed, they should be rubbed 
with warm bran water, or flour and water ; to singe the 
finer varieties of poultry use a spirit lamp; this does 
not discolor the skin, neither does it -impart a smoky 
taste. If geese are to be kept for a long time they 
should not be washed after being drawn, at any rate 
they must be carefully wiped inside and out with a clean 
cloth until dry. 

Fowl for soups or stews should be put into cold 
water for % hour immediately after killing and they will 
fully retain their natural white color. Then take by 
the legs, let the water drip off and hold in seething hot 
water for a few minutes ; if the feathers do not come 
out easily, repeat, but for young fowls the water must 
not be too hot, otherwise the entire skin will come off. 

Beforeturkeys or capons are drawn, crush the breast 
bone by laying the fowl on its back on a cloth, fold a 
cloth over its breaRt to prevent the skin from being 
injured and then carefully crush the breast with a meat 
pounder; it is better, however, to do this only when the 
breast bone projects so - prominently as to spoil the 
appearance of the roast, because crushing somewhat 
lacerates the meat. The breast bone of a tende r Spring 
chicken nan be quite easily pressea crown witTTEFelliumb; 
it can then be easily taken out, wh ich greatly improves 
the appearance of the roast; 

Then cut off the head and feet, clean inside and out, 
carefully dry it and wrap in a cloth ; it should be laid in 
a dish until wanted, otherwise the a ction of the air w ill 
injure the whiteness of the skin . "W hen ready T6 co'ok 
Wash slightly once more and truss according to its kind. 
The liver and stomach of small fowls are roasted in the 



156 D.— Meats. 

body if they are not intended to be used in the dressing; 
the filling should be attended to before the fowl is 
trussed. 

a. Turkeys are prepared as follows for a roast: 
Bend the wings toward the head so that Jthe tips will 
lay flat on the back, then turn the turkey on its back, 
draw the head under the left wing so that it will lie 
beside the breast, and fasten it with a thin wooden 
skewer, being careful not to injure the meat. Then 
press the legs upwards towards the head, thus pushing 
forward the breast, run a wooden skewer through the 
drumsticks to hold them up closely. Fat pork s lices 
are tied .o yer the bre ast of the turkey "bef ore"iFis put 
into the oven. *" "~ 

b. Chickens, capons, Spring chickens and pigeons 
are prepared in the same way; chickens and pigeons 
are not larded, capons and Spring chickens are stuffed 
and larded according -to taste. After stuffing, the legs 
are crossed and passed through the laps of the skin 
under the breast. 

c. The greatest caution is necessary in drawing 
geese, so that the valuable grease is not spoiled by 
coming in contact with the entrails; after making a 
large opening under the breast extending to the tail, 
loosen the skin from the leafy fat. Take this fat with 
the right hand and loosen it from under the breast 
bone, to which it adheres, loosen it to the right and left 
from the ribs and stomach and pull it out in one whole 
piece, putting it into a covered dish containing cold 
water. Then carefully take out the liver and separate 
the gall bag from it"; the latter is enclosed in a very 
thin skin which must not be ruptured. Then take out 
the stomaeh, together with the entrails and the crop, 
which has been loosened from the neck. The entrails 
must be separated from the fat with great caution, as 
they break open very easily and are almost always 
filled, and the fat surrounding them is necessary for the 
roasting; this, like the leaf fat, should be laid into cold 
water also, but use a separate dish ; the water for both 
should be renewed daily until the fat is to be used. Gut 
open the stomach, clean it very carefully and with a 
sharp knife remove the thick inside skin. Cut off the 
head and neck of the goose and its feet and wings about 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 157 

2 inches from the body, using this together with the 
heart and stomach for giblet soup. Wash the goose 
thoroughly, dry it inside and out with a clean cloth and 
hang it into the larder for a few days. The stuffing can 
be done when ready to roast (or the day previously if 
preferred) according to the directions already given. 
The liver is roasted separately. 

Geese should be killed and prepared in very cold 
weather at least 2 days previous to cooking ; they can 
hang in the air for 2 — 3 weeks, but they are the nicest 
when cooked a few days after they are killed. The 
blood, which is indispensable for black giblet dishes, will 
keep in cold weather for several days when mixed with 
plenty of vinegar and set uncovered in a cool place. 

d. Ducks are treated like geese; the skin of the 
neck is drawn backwards, then the neck is cut off and 
the skin is forced in the opening; they are sometimes 
stuffed according to previous directions. 

e. Pheasants, partridges and grouse. The feet are 
not cut off as in the case with other kinds of fowl, but 
they are . held for a time in boiling water, af ter which 
the skin i^tak eh~on ? *alTg*'i;Tfe" BpuTfl" WmovedT The tips 
of thewi'rig^ aTKTcut a way, the liver "alTd stomach are

as with other poultry and the legs are turned from the 
second joint from below in such a manner that the feet 
point towards the head. Then pass a thin, small, 
wooden skewer through the drumsticks. 

f. Snipe are prepared in the' same manner with the 
exception that they are not d rawn; the bill is bent over 
and turned in the breast". '" 

169. To bone Poultry. After the fowl has been 
plucked, drawn, washed and singed, cuj^through the 
skin, down the cen ter of the back anaraise the flesh 
carefully on either side* with "the- point of a sharp knife 
untilthe sockets of thewings andthethighs are reached, 
being'careful not to damage the skin. O ccasionally the 



wings and le gs ar e also bjjagd. As a rule Donea poultry 
ilTfitlBTrwith forcemeat and this should be done with 
some care, so as to preserve as much as possible the 
original form of the bird. When securely trussed and 
sewed the bird may .be either boiled or stewed with 



158 D.— Meats. 

a rich gravy; serving it hot with mushrooms, capers, 
truffles or oysters; or it may be roasted after being 
boned and forced. 

'■ 170. Roast Turkey. If the turkey has been killed 
for a few days or a week before cooking and after it has 
been prepared as directed in No. 169, bend the joints 
upwards before cooking, lard if desired wherever there 
•are no fatty portions, or else omit the larding and fill 
with a forcemeat, (see A, Nos. 27, 28 or 29). Sprinkle* 
with fine salt, line the pan, which should be very clean, 
with thin fat pork slices and some of the same -should 
be laid on the breast ; put in plenty of butter and boil- 
ing water and then put the turkey on the fire, cover 
tightly, and let it cook in a scant broth, for 1% hours, 
or long enough until the meat is almost tender; the 
.cooking should proceed slowly but uninterruptedly, but 
the heat must not be too great. Pour, the broth into a 
separate vessel, lay a large piece^t butter on the breast 
of the turkey, and bring it into a hot oven, roast until 
. quite' tender, and of a yellow (not brown) color ; frequent 
basting is very essential and should be carefully at- 
tended to. The broth is added gradually; 1 the addition 
of cream will make the gravy much thicker. "When 
ready to. serve stir 2 tablespoonf uls of flour in the pan 
for a few minutes, adding enough cold water to bind 
the gravy, stirring in everything that, remains in the 
pah or adheres to. it. , Add whatever salt is necessary. 
Serye the turkey on a, hot platter, garnishing with a 
border of thin lemon slices. ., 

; ' A young turkey will require about 1% hours until it 
is tender; old birds from 3 hours and upwards. 

■!•!'. Remark, — The heart, Stomach, wings, etc., of a turkey, together with some 
vea^, may he cooked to make agood fricassee, to which dumplings, mushrooms, 
etc., caii Be added, or else, with a little real, they make a clear soup. 

171. Turkey with Forcemeat. Make a forcemeat of 
•Impound of chopped Veal, % pound of streaky pork, also 
finely chopped, % cupful of melted, butter, *3 eggs, the 
whites of 2 eggs beaten to a froth and stirred in at last. 
Further mbre, 4. ounces of stale' wheat bread soaked in 
cold wafer and pressed, % ounce of sliced mushrooms or, 
better still, truffles, the turkey liver finely chopped, 4 
veal sweetbreads cooked until half done and with the 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 159 

skin removed, salt, nutmeg, capers and finely chopped 
parsley. This forcemeat is filled into the craw and body 
of the turkey, after which it is roasted. 

A turkey can also be filled with a dressing. made of 
wheat bread, to which dried currants can be added 
according to taste. 

A very fine flavor or aroma can be imparted to the 
turkey by means of truffles. Get a freshly killed turkey 
ready for roasting and in the meantime steam about 
Impounds of truffles with some sweet herbs,, salty % 
pound of very thinly sliced pork fat, and % -glassful of 
claret for about 20 minutes. Let the truffles cool, fill 
the turkey and sew ; dress it, cover with fat pork slices 
(tied over the body) and let it hang for 6 days in a coqI 
place. The turkey is then roasted as usual, but instead 
of putting cream into the gravy it is flavored with 
Madeira. Turkey roasted in this manner is the nicest, 
but it is also very expensive. 

When filled in the above manner the turkey will 
suffice for quite a large party, and can be brought to 
the table either hot or cold. 

172. Turkey in Vienna Style. After the turkey 
has been prepared for roasting, fill it with the following 
dressing : Shell and blanch 1% pounds of chestnuts, sim- 
mer in meat broth until soft, let them dry and pound 
finely in a mortar together with some' salt, pepper and 
nutmeg. Stir % pound of butter to a froth, mix .with 
the yolks of 4 eggs, the chestnuts, 3 ounces of cracker 
crumbs, and also mix a few dozen chestnuts, with the 
forcemeat, which is then filled into the craw and body of 
the turkey, whereupon the latter is larded a,hd roasted. 

The gravy is prepared according to No. 170, but a 
glassful of Madeira is added at last. 

173. Hen=Turkey in a Fricassee Sauce. A hen-turkey 
is prepared as for a roast ; the legs can be inserted as 
directed in 168, b., then put it on the fire with.% pound 
of fresh butter and. a few eschalots, cover tightly and 
cook slowly until yellow. Add some boiling meat broth 
or water together with the yellow part only of a lemon 
peel, nutmeg, and half an hour later plenty of mush- 
rooms, coyer tightly and stew In scant broth until done. 
Have ready some strong meat broth and half an hpur 



160 D.— Meat&. 

before serving put in some flour browned in butter and, 
according to taste, some sweetbreads (see A, 35), aspar- 
agus or cauliflower, cook until tender, but it should not 
in the least be broken up. Take the fat from the turkey 
gravy and add to it the cooked gravy, which, like every 
other fricassee gravy, should be well bound, together 
with a few lemon slices without the seeds ; stir through 
it the yolks of 2 eggs and then serve the turkey in 
its own gravy with bread-, sponge- or veal dumplings, 
which have been broughtto a boil in salted water. Send 
to the table with croutons which are served instead of 
pastry. If the hen-turkey was not ayoung one it should 
be parboiled at least 1 to 3 hours before cooking it 
entirely done in the fricassee gravy as above described. 

174. Roast Capon. The capon is gotten ready like 
the turkey, well larded and covered with fat pork slices 
and slowly roasted in butter about labours, according 
to age. 

175. Stewed Capons with various kinds of Sauces. 

After the capon is ready for cooking line the bottom of 
a clean kettle with fat pork slices and put in celery 
slices, carrots, parsley root, parsnips, eschalots, lean 
raw ham, coarse spices and salt, then the capon; cover 
it with fat pork slices, add bouillon and stew slowly 
until done, but not too soft. Serve with either oyster-, 
mushroom- or crab sauce. For a small capon take from 
1—2 cupfuls of bouillon. 

Instead of serving the capon with a sauce, it may 
be brought to the table in a fine ragout if preferable ; or 
else it may be cut up. Pour over it a truffle sauce and 
put a border of boiled rice around the edge of the dish. 

176. Baked Puffs of Capon Remnants. Entree. Big- 
move skin and sinews from all the remnants and chop 
the latter very finely. Crack all the bones and boil 
them thoroughly, cooking with the broth flour lightly 
browned in butter, add a cupful of thick sweet cream 
and a trifle of extract of beef, salt and pepper, and cook 
the whole to a thick, smooth sauce. Mix the chopped 
meat with the sauce, add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2heaping 
tablespoonfuls of fresh butter, stir the frothed whites of 
the eggs through the mass, fill it into a mould and bake 
for 30 minutes. Send to the table without any sauce. ^

177. Roast Spring Chicken. The best method of 
roasting young spring chickens is to lard them thickly 
the same as a hare, as is customary in Bremen and 
Hamburg; it makes them juicier and gives them a fine 
appearance on the table. They should be roasted in a 
kettle with a tight cover, and the kettle should be of 
fitting dimensions — not too large. If the cover is so 
arranged that embers can be placed upon it, so much 
the better, if not, the kettle must be put into a hot 
oven after the chickens have become tender so that 
they will rapidly become lightly brown on top. 

After the chickens have been prepared according to 
the directions in No. 168, b., sprinkle moderately with 
fine salt because some salt is contained in the butter, 
put a piece of butter together with the liver into the 
body of each chicken and then put them into the kettle 
closely side by side with a piece of butter; roast with 
the kettle uncovered at first on a slow fire until lightly 
brown, then put on the cover and roast until tender, 
which will take about IK hours. According to the 
requirements of a fine table, poultry must never be 
roasted too stronglybut should have abeautiful golden 
brown color, and to attain this end it must at first 
be covered with fat pork slices. 

"Spring chickens will retain their juiciness if covered 
on the back and sides with fat pork slices, a nd are then 
wrapped in gra pe leaves which nave nrst been carefullly 
washed andariedT - "*""" 

A good % hour after they are done, dredge with 
finely rolled cracker crumbs (especially if the chickens 
have not been.larded) which enhances their appearance 
and improves the quality of the gravy; in this case, 
however, the latter should be served without anything 
else being added. Instead of the cracker c rumbs, some 
thick s weet crea m "caTT be'added'^^^jaT^^Rrlng the 
la^TTra^TTiour^orcooIdDg. TheT^''sTioula r *then be 
stronger and ba sting m ore frequ ent. Care should be 
exercised that the gravy" does""nWfBe , eOnfe'*too brown. 

178. Baked Spring Chicken in Gravy. After the 
chickens have been prepared for cooking they are di- 
vided lengthwise and then roasted until tender and 
juicy as directed in the preceding receipt. Take them 
out of "iihe pan, brown some flour in the butter remain- 



162 D.— MpATS. 

ing in the pan, stir with it some strong beef broth, 
chopped mushrooms, a little mace, some lemon slices 
and, perhaps, a glassful of white wine ; cook every thing- 
together to a thick gravy. After stirring through it 
the yolks of a few eggs, fill each half of the chicken with 
the mass, heaping it somewhat in the center., sprinkle 
with grated Parmesan cheese, put into a pan side by 
side and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, after which 
serve without any additions. 

179. Baked Spring Chicken in South Germany Style, 
("Backhaenel"). The chickens should be about 6 or 8 
weeks old ; after plucking and washing, hold them in 
hot water for a minute, then in cold water, and with a 
sharp knife divide them lengthwise into two pfeces, take 
out the backbone and cut each half in two sideways, 
thus dividing the chicken into quarters. Sprinkle with 
fine salt and turn in flour, dip in eggs beaten with 
water, then turn in bread crumbs which can be used, if 
preferred, with Parmesan cheese, and immediately bake 
in plenty of lard which must not be too hot, to a light 
brown. 8 pieces can be put into the hot lard at a time, 
moving the pan gently to prevent scorching. Only 
about 4 minutes are necessary to bake the chickens 
nicely and give them a good color. 

Drain off the fat by laying the pieces on bread slices 
until all are done, and lightly brown a handful of fresh 
parsley, which has been washed and dried in a cloth, in 
some lard, but to prevent overheating the pan should 
first be taken from the fire. Then serve the chicken on 
a warmed platter and garnish with the parsley, which 
has been sprinkled with a little salt; lay* a little bunch 
of fresh parsley on the meat. 

,180. A dainty Fricassee of Capons, young Spring 
Chickens or Pigeons with Crabs. Divide the chicken into 
quarters and the pigeons lengthwise in two, so that the 
one kind can- be readily distinguished from the other, 
but this maybe done according to preference; capons 
are not cut up. Put on a medium. fire with some salt 
and plenty of butter, cover tightly and after atime turn 
them; in % hour add some boiling bouillon, a few lemon 
slices without any seeds, some mace and finely rolled 
cracker crumbs; cover and cook slowly until tender but 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 163 

the meat should not drop to pieces. During the last 
15 minutes of cooking add to the stew the following 
ingredients, prepared as described under A, 35 to 37: 
Veal sweetbreads, crabs with dressing, mushrooms, 
asparagus .tips, small sausages and when serving add 
wheat bread dumplings which have first been cooked in 
salted water or bouillon, oysters, crab tails and crab 
butter, stir the yolks of 1 or 2 eggs through the gravy. 
Send to the table with croutons, which will take the 
place of pastry. 

Remark. — A plain fricassee is cooked similarly, excepting that the finer 
ingredients are omitted and boiling water is taken instead of bouillon. 

181. Chicken Fricassee in Rice with Crabs. Cook 
30—40 crabs, pick the meat out of the tails and claws 
and pound the shells (not too fine) in a mortar, and 
stir them on a medium fire until the butter begins to 
raise and turn red. Pour'in some meat broth, boil for 
% hour and strain through a fine sieve covered with a 
clean cloth. Boil from %*-l pound of scalded rice in 
bouillon until quite thick, adding some salt. In the 
meantime cook a chicken fricassee, using for this pur- 
pose the crab . bouillon made as directed, putting in 
sweetbreads, small sausages, crab tails and crab dump- 
lings (see under Division 0). Put the rice into a deep 
dish; have a hollow in the center large enough to con- 
tain the fricassee without any gravy. Then close the 
opening with the rice and smooth the surface nicely, 
pour over it melted butter and brown in the oven to an 
amber color, basting it occasionally with some of the 
sauce. The rest of the sauce should be cooked in the 
meantime, stirring through it either lemonjuice or wine 
and the yolks of eggs or crab butter. When on the 
table an opening is made in the top of the rice, put 
in a few spoonfuls of the sauce and pass the, rest of the 
latter in a boat. 

182. A fine Ragout of young Spring Chickens and 
Pigeons. For 12 persons take 4 spring chickens or 8 

■ pigeons. Get them ready as directed in No. 180 and 
stew them in butter until done. Brown a piece of butter 
the size of a hen's egg, throw in some flour and also 
brown it, being careful notto scorch. The browned flour 
is stirred with the brtith in which the birds have been 



164 t D.— Meats. 

cooked, afterwards adding a brown meat broth (which 
can be made of extract of beef) together with ^, sliced 
lemon, some ground cloves, pepper and salt; as soon 
as this commences to boil add according to pleasure 
any of the following : A small handful of either fresh or 
canned mushrooms cut into small pieces, or 6 — 8 sliced 
truffles, % pound of veal sweetbreads, % pound of large 
sweet chestnuts, % cupful of capers and 1 teaspoonful of 
pistachios and besides these, dumplings made from % 
pound of finely chopped meat. The- preparation of the 
above ingredients and the length of time they should 
cook in the ragout is described in Division A; the dump- 
lings are boiled in meat broth or salted water, and put 
into the ragout at last when it«is sent to the table. The 
gravy should be rather thick and just slightly sour. 

183. Spring Chicken in Sauce. Put on the fire in 
a little boiling water with salt, a good-sized piece of 
butter and some parsley root, skim thoroughly and 
cook until not quite tender. Then use the chicken broth 
to make a caper-, mushroom-, anchovy- or crab sauce, 
which is put over the chickens when they are served. 

184. Fricassee or Ragout with a Rice Border. Put 

% pound of rice on the fire in cold water; as soon as it 
begins to boil pour off the water, renew with cold water 
and bring to a boil again. After the last water has 
been poured off, drench the rice' with cold water and 
cook with 1 pint of meat broth, 1% tablespoonfuls of 
fresh butter, salt, a few sliced onions and 12 white 
peppercorns and cook until tender and thick. Then 
butter a round mould, press the rice into it, put it into 
a hot oven for 10 minutes, and then turn it out on a hot 
dish ; however, the rice can be turned out of the mould 
without first being put into the oven. . A dainty ragout, 
fricassee or chicken hash is 'then filled into the rice ring; 
send to the table hot. 

, 185. Chicken Souffle. Cut the chicken very fine and 
mix it with several spoonfuls of white sauce (see receipt), 
a piece of butter stirred to a froth, salt, several spoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese, and the yolks of 2 or, 3 
eggs, frothing thewhites and stirring through the mass. 
Butter several small souffle cases and fill with the mass, 



. Tame and Wild Fowl. 165 

put, on a tin and bake them in a medium oven to a light 
brown. This dish must be eaten immediately. The 
souffle can be made from chicken remnants if desired. 

186. Chicken with Hacaroni or Rice. Cook 5 ounces 
of macaroni in salted water and cool in cold water, 
butter a smooth pudding mould, in the center of it 
arrange a star of mushrooms, winding the macaroni 
around and about the star, brush' with the yolks of 
eggs, cover thickly with forcemeat A, No. 24, and put 
diced remnants of chickens, veal sweetbreads, ox tongue, 
truffles, mushrooms, crab tails and small dumplings 
into the mould in layers; fill around the edge of the 
mould thickly with the macaroni, also brushed with 
egg, and then pour a very thick crab- or Bechamel 
sauce over the contents of the dish, put on another 
layer of the forcemeat, and finally cover the surface 
closely with the macaroni. Cook in a double kettle for 
an hour, turning out of the mould and serve with the 
remainder of the crab- or Bechamel sauce. Rice may be 
substituted for the macaroni, and various kinds of the 
finer varieties of vegetables can be used instead of the 
sweetbreads, etc. 

187. Chicken with Pearl Barley. Put a nicely pre- 
pared chicken on the fire in some salted water as for a 
soup, using less water, however, (see chicken soup, B, 
No. 18,) skim well, add a piece of butter and a little 
mace and cook slowly under a tight cover; often chick- 
ens are fat enough so that the butter is unnecessary. 
In the meantime cook 3 ounces of pearl barley with 
chicken broth until quite tender — it should at last be 
quite thin enough to be eaten with a spoon instead of a 
fork; the chicken broth is not put in at once, but is 
added gradually. The chicken is then placed whole, or, 
if preferred, divided into pieces, into the bottom of a 
round dish with the pearl barley surrounding the meat. 
Browned butter may be put over this dish, but it is not 
absolutely necessary. 

188. Chickens in Rice. Boil the chickens in salted 
water, skim and cook with a large piece of butter until 
done. Scald the rice, add the chicken broth gradually 
and cook slowly until the rice is quite tender but not 



166 D.— Meats. 

pulpy; % hour before it is tender add, according to 
taste, some nicely washed raisins to the rice and gradu- 
ally fill in the remaining broth to prevent the rice from 
becoming too thick. Cut up the chickens, keep them 
hot and put them into the middle of the dish, surround 
with the lice and garnish with small dumplings accord- 
ing to taste. 

189. Chickens with Tomatoes. Cut up two spring 
chickens before they are cooked, bone them and after 
smashing the bones fry them with the wings and drum- 
sticks in 4 spoonfuls of the best olive oil. Then add 
3 chopped onions, a bunch Of parsley and salt, pepper 
and the breast pieces, furthermore 10 sliced tomatoes 
and 1 small cupful of strong bouillon, and stew all 
together until tender. Arrange the meat with a rice 
border, strain the gravy, thicken if necessary and pour 
it over the meat. 

190. Roasted young Pigeons should be killed a day 
or two before cooking, plucked iand drawn, but must 
not be exposed to the air after being plucked. Fill with 
forcemeat A, No. 26, if desired, put on a medium fire in 
a vessel having a tight fitting cover, with plenty of 
good butter and a few grains of salt (they are easily 
oversalted) ; roast slowly but continuously until they 
are quite tender. Pigeons should roast to a yellow 
color only and the gravy must not in the least be too 
dark. 

Great care in preparing pigeons is particularly neces- 
sary when they are intended for the Sickroom. When 
ready to serve, a few fresh chopped juniper berries (not 
ground or pounded) may be put into the butter and 
a small spoonful of sweet cream be added during the 
roasting; however, both are matters of taste, the main 
point is that the color be light and the meat tender, 
especially if for invalids. 

191. Young Pigeons with Asparagus Tips. After „ 
preparing the pigeons scald them for a minute in seeth- 
ing hot water, cool in fresh water and salt them. Then 
fry in butter until yellow all over, add 1 onion, 1 carrot, 
parsley, and after dredging some flour over the pigeons, 
a cupful of meat broth; then stew the pigeons until, 
tender. Put them where they will remain not, strain 



Tame and Wild -Fowl. 167 

the gravy and thicken it, if necessary, with some bread 
crumbs, and stir the yolks of 4 eggs through it, add 
lemon juice, alittle pepper andflne sugar; have ready as- 
paragus tips cooked in salted water, mix them through 
the gravy, put into the center of a deep dish and ar- 
range over it the pigeons divided into halves. 

192. Roast Duck. Ducks can be roasted with or 
without filling. They are filled with currants and quart- 
ered apples, or else with the following dressing- which is 
preferable: Chop the heart, lungs, liver and stomach 
(which must have the skin removed) very finely, add a 
piece of butter the size of half an egg, 2 eggs, about 
5 ounces of wheat bread soaked in cold water and then 
well pressed, nutmeg and salt. 

In England a filling is made consisting of a mixture 
of onions stewed in butter, bread crumbs, sage and a 
little salt. The forcemeats used for filling turkeys are 
also well adapted for ducks. 

In Saxony a sprig of mugwort is simply placed in 
the duck; in Bavaria a filling consisting of potatoes 
and pork sausages is considered good. It is made of 
peeled and diced boiled potatoes and the sausages are 
fried and sliced; the diced potatoes are stewed until 
done with sliced onions, parsley, pepper and nutmeg, 
shaking frequently, then mixed with the sausage slices 
and filled into the duck. 

Rub the duck with some salt, put it on the fire with 
plenty of butter and a little water, cover tightly and 
roast slowly for 2 — 2% hours according to the age of 
the duck, if necessary occasionally adding a dash of 
boiling water along the side of the vessel. Basting must 
not be neglected. As soon as the duck is tender prepare 
the sauce'as directed for turkey. 

193. Ducks stewed with Onions. Boil the duck in 
salted water and skim ; add Y 2 soupplateful of sliced 
onions, some wheat bread and cloves, cook all together 
until tender. Strain the gravy, cook it with lemon 
slices and spread it over the duck. 

194. Ducks with Claret. The duck should be lightly 
roasted in butter with a few sliced onions, being careful 
not to get it too brown, otherwise the butter will be apt 



168 D.— Meats. 

to lose its flavor. Then add boiling water, some lemon 
peel, cloves, cardaitaon seeds and salt, afterwards some 
flour lightly rubbed in butter, dark meat broth, and 
when ready to serve, a large glassful of claret and a few 
lemon slices. The gravy must have a brownish color 
and be of a good consistency. Truffles cooked in the 
gravy improve the dish. 

195. Ducks a la Frangaise. Chop the liver with 
some pork fat and eschalots, and make up into a force- 
meat with some wheat bread soaked in water and 
pressed, 2 eggs, nutmeg and salt, fill into the duck and 
sew. Line the bottom Of the kettle with butter or fresh 
bacon and roast the duck in it to a yellow color. Add 
a handful of parsley, 3 or 4 whole onions and when the 
broth is all cooked away, some carrots. Pourin 1 pint 
of water or weak bouillon, and cook the duck in this 
until light brown in color and well done. Stir through 
the gravy a little browned flour, boiling water, a trifle 
of vinegar and, according to taste, a piece of sugar, and 
stew the duck in this for a few minutes longer. 

196. Ducks with Dumplings. Line a kettle with a 
number of pork fat slices, put in the duck, ,and add 
peppercorns, cloves, 2 — 3 bay leaves and a few onions. 
Cover the kettle tightly and stew the duck on a medium 
fire, turning it once. After half an hour, add some 
lemon peel in small pieces and enough meat broth so 
that the duck can cook in it until tender. Have ready 
% of the quantity of forcemeat A, No. 26, add to it some 
ground cloves and the finely chopped liver, heart and 
stomach of the duck; roll up into little dumplings. Then 
thicken the gravy with flour lightly browned in butter, 
add a few lemon slices and some wine, and stew the 
duck in this for a little while longer. During this time 
boil the dumplings in bouillon or salted water, gar- 
nish the duck with them when served, strain the gravy 
through afine sieve, adding to itthe mushrooms cooked 
until white; the gravy is poured over the duck. 

197. Stewed Duck in a Brown Gravy. For a full 
grown young duck take 1 pint of water, a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, 6 eschalots, the necessary salt, 
cover tightly and stew slowly until tender so that the 
gravy will not be too scant. When the duck is done, 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 169 

stir with it a spoonful of flour browned in butter, %— 1 
glassful of wine, 4—6 ground cloves, a little sugar, and 
stir the duck in this for a little while longer. 

198. Ducks with New Turnips. Prepare the ducks 
as directed in No. 196. Peel small new turnips, cut 
them into pieces of uniform size, boil in hot water, and 
after cooling them in fresh water, steam them with 
butter, a little meat broth, salt and some sugar until 
tender, but they should not become too soft. Keep the 
ducks in a hot place, take the fat from the gravy, 
thicken the latter with flour browned in butter, mix 
with a cupful of thick, sweet cream and then put part of 
the gravy with the turnips. Cut up the ducks, heat 
them in the gravy and serve them with the turnips 
arranged around the meat as a garnish. Bring to the 
table with roasted potatoes. 

199. Jellied Ducks. (See directions in Division M.) 

200. Wild Ducks are prepared for cooking the same 
as tame ducks, wrapped in slices of pork fat and roasted 
without filling in a pan with butter and pork fat slices 
until juicy and tender; thick cream may be added if 
desired. 

201. Wild Ducks. The best methods of cooking 
according to the age, etc., of the duck are the same as 
directed for a wild goose under No. 209. If intended for 
a roast, rub it with fine salt and pepper, wrap in fat 
pork slices and roast with butter for 1 hour in the oven, 
basting frequently; or else put on the fire with plenty 
of butter and nice kidney suet, 2 bay leaves, 2 lemon 
slices and 8 juniper berries ; cover tightly. As soon as 
the duck is yellow on both sides pour over it a very 
little boiling water and then roast slowly until tender 
and of a light brown color. The addition of thick 
cream will be found an improvement. S tir up the gravy 
with some cold water and cook it with a little extract 
of beef and a glassful of claret and serve. An old 
wild duck should be cooked like* brown ragout of hare 
("Hasenpfeffer"), using plenty of onions, but no sugar. 

202. Roast Goose. After the goose has been gotten 
ready as directed under D, VII, No. 168, c, fill the body 
with quartered apples, which can be mixed with raisins 



170 D— Meats. 

or dried currants, or else with diced toasted bread; 
sometimes the filling consists of boiled chestnuts or 
small potatoes and salt, after sewing the opening put 
the goose into the pan with salt, pour in a pint of water, 
cover tightly and then roast until tender; as soon as 
this point has been reached, take off the cover and 
proceed with the roasting and baste, adding boiling 
water from time to time. To make the crust nicely 
crisp quickly pour a few spoonfuls of cold water over 
the skin about half an hour before the roast is done. 
The goose as well as the gravy must have a light brown 
color. When serving, be sure to remove the thread and 
finish the gravy as directed for roast turkey. Very 
young geese are roasted without water but with plenty 
of butter because usually they have very little fat. 
Small-sized geese, if young, require about 1 hour for 
roasting, large-sized ones from 2 — 2% hours. 

. For a very fine roast the following filling is con- 
sidered very superior. Chop the l iver of the goose 
together with 9 ounces each of c alf s liver , veal_ and - 
.pork ye rv fine, strain, add about l^od'hces of sliredded 
pork' fat, a little thyme, sa lt, pepper, the yolks of 2jggS... 
and some soaked and presse d wheat bread, stirring all 
of this to a smooth dressing. ~ ■— ■ 

203. Qoose in Jelly. See Division M. 

204. Fried Goose Liver. Lay the liver into Water 
and . mjlk for a few hours ; dry it and cut into slices, or, 
if very small", TeaTJftirWlftJte, salt, turn in egg and bread 
crumbs, and then fry in butter— if sliced fry for 2 min- 
utes, and if whole for 10 minutes. Serve with a border 
of steamed apple slices, or cover it with a truffle or 
Madeira sauce ; in the latter case it need not be turned 
in the egg and bread crumbs. 

205. Qoose Giblets in.Westphalian Style. For this 
dish take everything that is not wanted for the roast: 
neck, wings, liver, heart, stomach and, perhaps, the 
legs ; the latter are laid in hot water and skinned. The 
neck as well as the rest is divided into several pieces. If 
the meat is not to be used at once, set it aside in some 
vinegar. When ready to cook put it on the. fire with 
not too much salted water, adding a few onions, 4 bay 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 171 

leaves, pepper and cloves and, according to taste, 2 
hahdfuls of scalded prunes; cook until done. Brown 
flour in butter, being careful not to scorch, stir it 
through some of the broth and add to the giblets, 
together with some vinegar and a piece of sugar to 
impart a sweet-sour taste to the gravy. In some parts 
of Germany it is customary to use grated honey cake 
instead of the browned flour, to bind the gravy. If any 
of the blood of the goose has been caught this is cooked 
with the giblets, greatly improving the color and flavor 
of the dish, but in such case very little flour must be 
used because the gravy is sufficiently thickened by the 
blood. The gravy should be plentiful, nicely thick and 
have a spicy apd tart flavor. Potatoes are a proper 
accompaniment. 

If the giblets should be insufficient in quantity, add 
a small piece of diced pork fat; peeled and sliced pears 
can be cooked with them and if there should not be 
enough blood to properly thicken the gravy, use some 
flour rubbed in butter. In Mecklenburg bread dump- 
lings previously cooked in salted water are added to 
the dish. 

Remabk. •— When killing the goose the blood may be caught and stirred 
with vinegar, and it will keep in the Winter from three days to a week if the 
weather is cold enough and it is set aside in a cool place ; without the vinegar, 
however, it would spoil very soon. 

206. Goose Giblets are cooked in a variety of ways 
in different parts of Europe. According to the Stettin 
receipt, the meat is put on the fire in salted water as 
directed in No. 205 and cooked in a rather scant broth 
until done. After this some butter is browned, a few 
finely chopped onions and also some flour are lightly 
browned in it, the whole stirred with some broth and 
added to the giblets, sharply seasoned with pepper and 
thyme and cooked for a few minutes longer in the 
gravy. 

In North Germany apples and dried currants are- 
preferred cooked with the giblets, omitting the blood; 
in Brandenburg finely sliced new turnips and potatoes 
are added; in Pommerania, kohlrabi, celery root, car- 
rots and parsley roots are cooked with the broth of the 
giblets, which are also seasoned with parsley ; and in 
Russia a mixture of the giblets with steamed dried fruit 



172 D.— Meats. 

of various kinds, such as pears, apples, plums anJ 
cherries is considered a delicacy. No blood is used in 
cooking giblets according to any of these modes. 

207. Stuffed Goose Neck. This makes an excellent 
dish for the supper table and is prepared as follows: 
Take the thick outer skin of the neck, rub it inside and 
out until very clean and fill it two-thirds full with the 
forcemeat A, No. 24, or else with a dressing made of the 
finely chopped liver, stomach and heart* of the goose, 
mushrooms, fresh bacon, pork, a little majoram, eggs 
and bread crumbs. Sew the neck at both ends, fry in 
goose oil until done, press it between two flat -weights 
and send to the table in slices. Instead of frying the 
neck it can also be cooked in meat broth mixed with 
some white wine. 

208. Brown and White Ragout of Goose. The whole 
goose is cut into pieces and cooked until tender in 
• salted, water with the heart, stomach, liver, a few onions, 

3 bay leaves, % of a sliced lemon — removing the seeds 
and white inner skin — and a pinch of fine pepper. If it 
is to be a brown ragout, add some ground cloves, flour 
browned in butter, vinegar, a small piece of sugar and 
at last, the blood of the, goose. If the ragout is to be 
white, omit the vinegar, blood, and sugar, and instead 
of these add lightly browned flour, a few lemon slices 
and ground nutmeg, and the yolk of an egg is stirred 
through the gravy. 

209. Wild Goose. An old wild goose is decidedly 
tougher than an old tame one, consequently young 
wild geese only are fit for roasting. Otherwise cut into 
small pieces as directed in D, VII, No. 168, c., f and let 
it stand for a week in a pickle of boiled vinegar, bay 
leaves and cloves, turning it daily. Proceed as with 
ragout of hare ("Hasenpfeffer"), omitting the sugar. 

For roasting*, the goose is rubbed inside and out 
with salt, pepper and ma,ce and roasted like a tame 
goose— without stuffing, however — in butter and kidney 
suet, until yellow and tender. % cupful of cream added 
duringthe last half hour of cooking improves the gravy. 

210. Roast Pheasant. The pheasant should be hung 
in its plumage for 2 or 3 days before cooking. After 
the pheasant is plucked, singe over burning spirits and 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 173 

prepare otherwise as usual with fowls, draw, and dry 
iuside carefully with a cloth, sprinkle with fine salt and 
tie a slice of pork fat over" the breast. Roast the pheas- 
ant in plenty of butter for 1 — 1% hours until juicy, 
tender and of a golden brown color. , 

Partially take up all of the fat that remains in the 
pan, then stir into the latter browned flour and cold 
bouillon, cook to a nice gravy which is served in a boat. 
The most fitting cornpot to serve with the pheasant is 
one of peaches or apricots; a celery salad or water 
cresses are also appropriate accompaniments. 

211. Pheasants with Sourkrout. Take for this dish 
older birds which are not so well adapted for roasting, 
prepare them as for a roast, wrap in pork slices and 
then roast in butter until about half done. In the 
meantime cook about as much sourkrout as is neces- 
sary (about a quart for 2 oheasants) in an enameled- 
stew pan, together with a cupful of onions lightly 
browned in butter, 2 cupfuls of strong meat broth and 
% bottle of white wine; put in both of the pheasants 
and let all stew together slowly until done; cut up the 
pheasants, cook a few spoonfuls of dark meat broth 
through the sourkrout; serve. 

212. Pheasants with Macaroni. This is an excellent 
dish for which the remnants of pheasants can be util- 
ized. All of the skin is removed from the meat and the 
latter cut into little pieces, crush the bones and boil 
them slowly for an hour with a pint of water; strain 
the broth and thicken it with flour browned in butter, 
season with %, teaspoonf ul of extract of beef, % teaspoon- 
ful of mushroom catsup, a glassful of sherry, pepper 
and salt. Heat, but do not cook, the meat in this thick 
gravy. In the meantime cook about 6 ounces of broken 
macaroni in salted water, mix butter, a little bouillon 
and grated Parmesan cheese through the macaroni. 
Serve immediately, filling the meat with the gravy into 
the center of the dish, placing the macaroni around it 
in a border. 

213. Partridges, Grouse or Prairie Chickens are pre- 
pared for roasting like other fowl and, sprinkled with 
fine salt. Tie a thin slice of pork fat over the breast 
of the bird and roast it either on the spit or else in the 



174 D— Meats. 

oven with plenty of butter and a little water. Cover 
tightly and roast for %— 1 hour with great care, basting 
frequently and towards the last occasionally adding a 
spoonful of sweet or sour cream. When ready to serve, 
all that remains in the pan is loosened and stirred up 
with some cold water, a teaspoonf ul of rice flour and a 
little extract of beef, so as to bind the gravy somewhat, 
which is then finished with perhaps the addition of a 
little salt. 

A very dainty accompaniment to a roast of this' 
kind'is made as follows: Mince the heart and liver of 
the bird very fine, mix with them a few crushed juniper 
berries and stew for a few minutes in butter shortly 
before the meat is done. Toast a number of neatly 
trimmed slices of bread, spread with the paste prepared 
as above directed and surround the roasted birds with 
them. These patties must be ready at the same mo- 
ment the meat is to be sent to the table. 

214. Partridges in Saxony Style. After preparing 
the partridges as directed in the preceding receipt, lard 
the breast, sprinkle with salt, lay a piece of pork fat 

■ over it and wrap two clean grape leaves around each 
bird; put the partridges into hot butter, cover and 
roast slowly, occasionally adding a little water. After 
about % hour put sour cream (a spoonful at a time) 
over them and also bread or cracker crumbs and at the 
very last some melted butter. The grape leaves and 
pork fat, which will drop off during the roasting, are 
served separately. 

215. Cold Prairie Chickens with Gravy. Quarter 
the chickens, arrange them neatly in a dish and cover 
with the following sauce: 3 — 4 tablespoonfuls of good 
olive oil, 2—3 tablespoonfuls of white calf's foot jelly, 
2 tablespoonfuls of best vinegar, very finely minced 
eschalots, a trifle of estragon, pepper and salt, stir 
together until bound to a thick sauce. 

216. Roast Snipe. After the snipe is prepared for 
roasting as directed in 168, f., cover the breast with" 
thin slices of pork fat and turn the head so that the bill 
will point upwards. Put on the fire in cold butter, 
cover and let tliem roast slowly for 1 — 1^ hours. Put: 
a number of thin slices of toasted wheat bread under; 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 175 

the snipe to catch everything dropping from the inside. 
This toast (''Schnepfenbrot") is served in a hot dish, 
laying the birds on it. The snipe can also be drawn 
before roasting; remove the stomach and then chop 
the trail very finely with some pork fat, an eschalot, a 
trifle of lemon peel, some wheat bread soaked in cold 
water and pressed, salt and* pepper. Mix with beaten 
egg and spread on>the toast, which is then fried in lard 
until crisp and juicy. Send the Bnipe to the table sur- 
rounded with the toast, cover with the gravy and lay a 
number of lemon pieces onto the dish. 

217. Salmi of Snipe, Grouse and Wild Duck. Line 
the bottom of a kettle with a few slices of raw ham; put 
the birds on them, add a little salt, a few carrots, a few 
sliced eschalots or onions, and butter; cover tightly 
and roast until yellow, pour in some meat broth and 
keep on the stove until quite tender. Then with a sharp 
knife divide the birds into small neat pieces; all that 
cannot be cut up is ground in a mortar, together with 
the livers and the ham. Boil in the broth in which the 
birds have been cooked, put on a strainer and pour 
over it a little of the meat brbth, but do not stir, 
in order to prevent any bone splinters from passing 
through the sieve. Add some chopped eschalots and a 
pinch of pepper and bring to a boil once with the meat. 
The gravy for a salmi should really receive its consist- 
ency from the strained meat only, but when necessary, 
browned flour or bouillon jelly can be added, or instead 
of both of these toast a piece of wheat bread, roll finely 
and add to the gravy. If the salmi is to be particularly 
dainty mix a little Madeira or claret through the gravy, 
adding truffles and mushrooms at the last. , 

218. Curried Meats. In the East Indies, curries are 
usually made of fowl or fish, but they are also very 
good when made from any other kind of meat. Roasted 
and boiled meats are quite well adapted for curries, 
indeed many prefer a curry made from a roast, or boiled 
meat remnants, instead of having them warmed over or 
made into meat balls. 

* It is undeniable that spices are under certain con- 
ditions beneficial, improve the appetite and aid diges- 
tion. They should never be used to excess, however, and 



176 D.— Meats. 

the consent of the physician should first be obtained 
before spicing the food of sick or debilitated .persons. 
In making curries fresh milk is used as a substitute for 
cocoanut milk. The meat for the curry, whether raw 
or already cooked, should always simmer very slowly 
so that it wilj become very tender. A curry must never 
be cooked on a quick fire and is always eaten with 
boiled rice, which renders the sharpness of. the spicing 
more agreeable to the palate. 

For a curry of fowls, divide Spring chickens or 
pigeons into small pieces as.for fricassee and turn them 
slightly in flour. Brown a piece of butter in a kettle, 
put in the meat and roast rapidly until light brown, 
frequently shaking the kettle ; take out the meat with a 
skimmer and brown a few sliced onions in the butter 
until done, stirring them frequently. Then put the meat 
back into the kettle with the onions, move the kettle 
from over the fire and add enough sweet milk or a good 
bouillon made of extract of beef to cover the meat; 
cover the kettle tightly and simmer very slowly for at 
least 1 hour, but during this time stirring should be 
frequently attended to. After the elapse of half an hour 
smooth 2 teaspoonfuls of curry-powderwith sweet milk: 
Mix it through the meat, salt and simmer for 15 min- 
utes longer. At the last, boil for 1 or 2 chickens about 
% pound of rice in weakly salted boiling water, and put 
it on the colander to drain. The rice should not be 
lumpy and the grains should remain whole. Put the 
rice around the sides of a warmed dish aud fill the curry 
into the opening in the center. Serve. 

A little flavoring of lemon juice can be added accord- 
ing to taste. The gravy for the curry should not be 
thm. 

219. Partridge Cutlets for Invalids. Take from the 
partridge all of the meat that is free from sinews, pound 
it finely and mix with it salt and a spoonful of sweet 
cream. Crush the bones and fry them slightly in butter, 
excepting the wings and drumsticks which are used for 
the cutlets, and cook them with celery or parsley root 
and salt. Mould the minced meat into the form of 
cutlets and put a bone into each one; each partridge 
will make 4 cutlets, which are turned in egg and bread 
crumbs and fried in butter until done. Stir what re- 



Tame and Wild Fowl. 177 

mains in the pan with flour browned in butter, some of 
the bone broth, Madeira and sweet herbs to a gravy for 
the cutlets. 

220. flinced Remnants of Poultry for Invalids. Take 
the best meat from the remnants of any kind of fowl or 
poultry, mince very fine, stew in butter for a few mo- 
ments with a .little flour, a trifle of extract of beef and 
3 spoonfuls of thick sweet cream until it is thoroughly 
hot; serve immediately. 

Besides the above, nearly all dishes of fowl or poul- 
try are nutritious and well adapted for invalids, with 
the exception of fat ducks or geese ; Nos. 172, 173, 175, 
176, 179, 183. 184, 187, 189 and 209 are especially 
recommended for the sick room.

I. LAP.GE MEAT PIES. 

1 . General Directions. The dough must be adapted 
to the kind of pie that is to be made. Chicken-, pigeon-, 
lamb- or veal pies, for which the meat has been fricas- 
seed, are made with a fi a&jjuff paste or a good butter 
crust ; the latter should be used if the* meat is to be 
cooked until done" in the pie. The butter crust is used 
for hare or venison pies ; a water crum, which, of course, 
is not to be eaten, can also be made. 

Meat pies that are tint intended t,n be served at onc e 
after they are ready, m listen ot' be seaso n ed, with lenion 
iuice or vinegar, and m aioram m usL be - jlVLIL into nne 
dishes with, g reafrcautiori, "it at all. 

Always serVe a 1 good jelly "with cold meat pies 6f 
every description, excepting with goose liver patties. 

2. Goose Liver Patties ("Strassburger Gaenseleber- 
Pastete") No. 1. Divide 6 large goose livers into halves, 
cutting them in two where they are joined. Remove 
the yellow spot where the gall bag was attached and 
w ash the livers with sweet milk; w ater must not touch 
tfiem. J ^eel sotM t^ullles, 6111! litem into pieces about 

'the length of the little finger and lard eight of the pieces 
of liver with them. Slice the remaining livers and pound 
very finely, season with a tablespoonful of finely sliced 
eschalots stewed in butter, double this quantity of finely 
sliced truffles, fine salt, a little fine white pepper, nut- 
meg, and pound all this very fine. During the pounding, 
however, gradually add 2 pounds of fresh bacon which 
h»,s previously been boiled for an hour and sliced and 



Large Meat Pies. 179 

pounded after cooling; then pass the whole through a 
sieve. Line a goose liver tureen with thin pork fat 
slices, put in a layer of the forcemeat, then some of 
the whole pieces of liver sprinkled with salt and white 
pepper, another layer of forcemeat, some more of the 
liver and so on until the tureen is tilled ; a layer of the 
forcemeat must be on top. Cover the top with pork" 
fat slices and put the lid on the tureen ; if it does not 
close tightly seal it with strips of paper, using as a 
paste a little flour and Water, put into the oven and 
bake slowly for about 2 hours. For a smaller pie 1% 
hours will perhaps be sufficient. As it sometimes hap- 
pens that fat will drip from the tureen, it should at first 
beset on an old plate and afterwards on a low tripod. 

Goose liver patties can be made as large or as small 
as desired; a nice one can be made from 2 or 3 livers, 
which are then divided into smaller pieces. 

The two following receipts are also according to the 
Strassburg formula and many prefer them to the pre- 
ceding one, beca"use the patties are not so rich and 
consequently more wholesome. 

' 3. Goose Liver Patties, No. 2. Kemove every bit of 
skin from 3 pounds of veal and then chop the latter 
very finely with a handful of eschalots, the thin peel of 
a lemon (yellow part only), 10—12 freshened anchovies 
and a handful of chopped capers; add thereto ahand^ 
ful of whole capers, a handful of grated wheat bread, 
pounded spices the same as in the preceding receipt and 
enough whit$ wine to make a smooth dough. Take % of 
a pound of butter, 4 eggs, salt, water, and enough flour 
to make a stiff dough, knead it thoroughly; butter an 
appropriate.mould, sprinkle with grated bread, roll the 
dough, ^line the mould with it so that it will extend 
somewhat over the edges. 

Sprinkle the dough with grated wheat bread, put in 
a layer, of forcemeat, then a layer of the truffles cooked 
with spices in wine, a layer of sliced goose livers, another 
layer of forcemeat, truffles, goose livers, and so on until 
the mould is filled, the last layer must consist of force- 
meat. The contents are then entirely covered with pork 
fat slices and over these place strips of dough to bind 
the whole together; then make a cover of dough with 
a: knob in the center; the dough extending over the 



180 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

mould is turned inwards onto the cover and the edges 
then pressed together. ' Bake in the oven until light 
brown, which will take about 2 hours. When cold, turn 
out of the mould. Take 2 gbose livers for this patty. 

4. Goose Liver Patties, No. 3. The whiter and fatter 
the liver the better will be the patty. For a patty of 
medium size take 2 large goose livers that have lain in 
sweet milk for half a day, 1 pound of lean pork, 1 pound 
of leaf lard and 1 pound of truffles. Cut the livers into 
pieces, clean the truffles as already directed, sprinkle 
them with salt and white pepper and insert the truffles 
into the liver. Make a forcemeat of the pork, leaf lard, 
fragments of the liver all minced very finely and sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, pass through a sieve, salt 
the livers and then pack them into a pastry mould 
in layers, alternately with truffles and the forcemeat. 
Bake for 2— 2% hours in a medium hot oven; if one 
wishes to keep the patty for any length of time pour 
over it melted clear lard. 

Turned Heat Pies (Timbale). Note. — Timbales are 
a variety of hot meat pies now very frequently pre- 
pared. They are cooked in a cylindrical double bottom 
mould made of tin ; after the pie is done it is turned out 
of the mould and takes its name (timbale— drum) from 
its shape ; serve as a hot entree before the roast. 

Small timbales are made in the same manner iii 
little tin forms, but are then served after the soup (see 
No. 39). The filling for timbales is made in a variety 
of ways, but a good, firm chicken-, veal- or wild fowl 
forcemeat is always necessary, as well as a very fine 
ragout of veal sweetbreads, fowls, goose livers or fish 
with mushrooms, truffles or small dumplings; the ra- 
gout should be made with a strong, well cooked and 
thick brown or white gravy. The timbales will drop to 
pieces immediately if the forcemeat is too thin or if the 
ragout gravy is not well bound. 

Sometimes the outer wall or ring of a timbale con- 
sists of boiled rice; macaroni or a fine crusi!; it is occa- 
sionally sent to the table sweetened. 

5. 1 Timbale of Grouse. Pluck 3 grouse, singe over 
burning spirits, draw, and clean inside and out with 



Large Meat Pies. 181 

flour and water, Cut off the drumsticks, fry the breasts • 
Very juicy in butter, allow them to cool and then cover 
with buttered paper. 

Butter the timbale mould very carefully, and line 
the sides and. bottom with the breasts of the grouse, 
sliced cold, with truffles between. The slices will adhere 
to the buttered mould if pressed against it slightly. 
Spread over this lining (covering the bottom first and 
then the sides), three quarters of the forcemeat about 
% inch thick, taking care to fill all intervening spaces, 
and then put in the ragout, cover to the thickness of 
% — 1 inch with the rest of the forcemeat, with a sheet of 
buttered paper on top. An hour before serving the tim- 
bale is pat into the oven in boiling water, and shortly 
before sending it to the table turn it out onto a round 
dish. The mould is not taken off at once, but should 
remain about 1 minute longer after which it is cau- 
tiously lifted out; pour some of the gravy oyer the 
timbalej and serve the remainder in a boat. Frequently 
the forcemeat .contains all of the meat of the birds and 
the mould is lined with sliced truffles only, then with 
the forcemeat, with the ragout in the center of the 
dish. Or the roasted breasts of the grouse are slightly 
warmed and laid on the timbale after the latter is ready 
to send to the table: 

The forcemeat is made of two parts of meat, con- 
sisting of the flesh from the chicken's drumsticks, care- 
fully skinned, with the sinews taken out and mixed with 
veal, one part of fa ; t and one part of crust. The fat used 
for a fine forcemeat is taken from a fat calf, and is that 
part from which the udder finally develops; when not 
obtainable, substitute for it, veal kidney suet or good 
pork fat. 

To make the crust take 1 pint of water and 1 tea- 
spoonful of butter. As soon as this begins to boil, 
dredge in enough flour, constantly stirring, to make a 
thick dough, which is then taken out of the kettle. 
Partially dry it on a slow fire, put it on a plate, cover 
with buttered paper and let it cool. The meat and fat 
for the forcemeat is chopped very finely, each separately,' 
then pound together in a mortar, gradually stir into it 
the crust together, with 2 whole eggs and the yolks of 
2 eggs, season with salt and nutmeg and pass through 



182 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

a Sieve. This forcemeat is very nice and will keep for a 
longtime. 

The ragout is made of well prepared sweetbreads 
which have been eopked in bouillon. Brown 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour in butter, make a sauce of water, 
extract of beef and 1 large glassful of Madeira and' cook 
in it the sweetbreads cut into slices, sliced truffles and 
mushrooms,.salt, and stir through itthe yolks of 2 eggs. 
Pound and crush the remnants and bones of the birds 
and cook with the scrapings of the roast in the pan, 
some water and extract of beef, 'take off the fat and 
then cook with Madeira and flour browned in butter to 
a thickish gravy; then salt and strain. When the tim- 
bale ,is on the dish pour over it a little of the sauce, 
and serve the remainder in a boat. Or else the timbale 
is sent to the table without any gravy and the extract 
from the bones used for the ragout sauce. 

6. Timbale of Macaroni and Loin of Venison. Take 
% pound of macaroni and break them up into small 
pieces of uniform size. Cook for % hour in salted water, 
drain, mix with 2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter and 
4 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, butter the 
timbale mould carefully and line it all over thickly with 
the macaroni. Make a veal forcemeat, taking, about 
% pound of clear veal without any sinews, 3 ounces of 
fresh bacon, 5 eggs, salt, pepper, grated : nutmeg and 
chopped herbs, using the crust described in the preced- 
ing receipt. Blanch a few veal sweetbreads, cut them 
up and fry slightly in butter, slice % of a pickled tongue, 
stew some mushrooms and neatly'lard a tenderloin of 
beef; the latter is then cut into slices J£ inch thick, and 
spread over them a mixture of about 3 heaping table- 
spoonfuls of butter stirred with a pinch of salt and 
cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley and 
the juice of a lemon, all passed through a sieve together; 
fry the meat on both sides in butter. Then cover the 
macaroni in the mould with the forcemeat, put in all of 
the other ingredients that have been prepared, cover 
with a layer of the forcemeat and finally put on a thick 
layer of the macaroni and then bake the timbale in the 
oven for 1% hours. Turn the timbale out of the mould, 
pour over it a thick Madeira sauce (see Division R) and 
serve the other gravy in a boat. 



Large Meat Pies. 183 

7. Timbale with Ragout. Butter a round timbale 
mould, dust it with finely grated wheat bread, beat 
4 eggs in lukewarm butter with salt and grated Par- 
mesan cheese to athickish but liquid mass, pour into 
the mould to cover all around and then sprinkle again 
with grated bread. Have ready a pound of rice that 
has been washed, scalded and then cooked in bouillon 
with a piece of butter, salt and some mace until tender 
and firm, and afterwards mixed with 2 tablespoonfuls 
of meat gravy, and 6 spoonfuls of grated Parmesan 
cheese. A ragout consisting of mushrooms, fowl livers, 
veal sweetbreads and slightly roasted pigeon breasts 
and a thick, strong Madeira sauce should also have 
been prepared in the meantime. Line the mould uni- 
formly with , the rice, fill in the ragout and cover it very 
evenly wjth rice. Bake, the pie for 1 hour, turn it out of 
of the mould, cover, with. Madeira sauce and serve the 
remainder of the sauce in a boat. 

8. Game Pie. In Water Crust. To make the crust 
for a medium-sized game pie, boil % pound of butter 
and M pound of kidney suet in % pint of water ; put 
3 pounds of flour on the moulding board, make a de- 
pression in the center and gradually stir the boiling 
water into the flour; this will make a strong dough 
which must be well kneaded and be very firm. The 
meat, whether hare or venison, should be previously 
washed and the skin and all sinews removed, cut into 
pieces of appropriate size and mixed with good-sized 
pieces of pork fat.. Then take eschalots or onions, 
sweet basil, majoram, cloves, pepper and ground cloves 
all chopped finely, and rub the meat with this season- 
ing. Line the bottom of a kettle with slices of pork fat, 
put in the meat with a few bay leaves and a small piece 
of butter, coyer tightly and cook until half done. The 
meat can also be pickled the day before in the following 
manner: Stir the herbs and spices named in wine or 
Vinegar, turn the meat in this liquor and put it into a 
flat dish, pour the liquor over it and cover. The next 
day it should also be cooked with pork fat until half 
done. Make, a forcemeat consisting of either 4 parts 
of meat from game,. free from skin or sinews, or else 
6 parts, of lean pork to 1 part of fresh pork fat chopped 
very finely, to which add lemon peel, eschalots stewed 



1S}4 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

in butter, a trifle of capers, all chopped very finely, some 
wheat bread soaked in cold water and then pressed; 
salt, the yolks of a few eggs, with the whites beaten to 
a froth, everything; mixed well together. Then roll a 
piece of the dough for the under crust about the thick- 
ness of a finger, put it into the buttered pan,roll a piece 
of the dough between the hands for the rim and flatten 
it with the rolling pin to the width of about 2 inches; 
cutting off both ends smoothly. The rim must be higher 
than the meat in the pan to leave room for the gravy, 
which is added later on. Now brush the lower crust 1 
with eggs* set around its edge the long strip of doUgh 
to make the side wall, put a few thin slices of pork fat 
on the lower crust and along the sides, spread the force- 
meat over it and then put in the meat a trifle higher 1 in 
the middle and: not too tightly packed, so that the pie 
will receive a: good form, fl there is plenty of forcemeat 
roll some of it into small dumplings and scatter them 
through the meat. After the contents of the pie have 
been covered with pork fat slices, brush its edge with 
the yolk'of an egg, roll sortie qf the dough for a cdver ? 
put it over the pie and press the edges together gently; 
trim the edges, indent them and ornament the top of 
the pie with little globes made Of pie crust, or leaves or 
other ornaments made from the same material. An 
opening about the size of a penny should be left in the 
center, with a little tube made of the pie crust to serve 
as a vent, otherwise the pie will burst. When sent to 
the table a round slice is cut out of the top, the pork 
slices removed and either the dark ineat gravy or a 
truffle sauce filled in. The rest of the gravy is served in 
a boatl 

9. Venison Pie, No. 2. Take a haunch of venison, 
pound it well, wash, remove the skin, cut into slices and 
lard. Pickle for 24 hours as in the preceding receipt; 
the forcemeat, however, is additionally seasoned with 
anchovies and the loosely filled in contents of the pie 
covered with a few spoonfuls of herb broth. 

10. A Hare or Wild Fowl Pie with Butter Crust. 

Clean the hare and after washing remove all sinews and 
skin ; cut the meat from the backbone, divide into pieces 
of fitting size and then lard it. The -wild fowl are also 



Lahge Meat Pies. 185 

cut into pieces. Both kinds of meat are pickled as 
directed in No. 8 and afterwards cooked slowly until 
nearly done. Line a pan thickly with butter, dust with 
cracker or bread crumbs and put in the meat; alter- 
nating with little dumplings made of the forcemeat 
described in No. 8, above, or No. 22, A, so that it will 
be heaping in the middle. Take some of the butter out 
of the pan, stir all adhering to the latter thoroughly 
with water and claret, add some of the herb broth and 
pour through a sieve over the meat. For a medium 
large meat pie take for the crusty pound of flour (see 
English pie crust, Division S), roll until it is about 
Jd inch thick, dust with a little flour and lap crosswise, 
because it then can be laid onto the pie easier; brush 
the edge of the pan with egg, put the crust cover on the 
meat, open it out flat and trim around the edge. From 
the remainder of the dough make a rim, brush the pie 
with egg, put on the rim and brush this also, but not i 
entirely all over, otherwise the crust will not rise. Then 
make 2 small incisions in the middle of the pie to serve 
as vents, and bake in the oven with 1 degree of heat 
(see Division S, No. 1) from 1% — 1% hours, according to 
the tenderness of the meat in the pie. Before sending 
to the table cut a round piece out of the top crust and 
pour a brown meat gravy into the pie, replace the piece 
of crust, cover the edge of the dish with a napkin or frill 
of paper and serve. 

-11. flixed Heat Pies. For these pies take any kind 
of tame or wild fowl, or hare or tenderloin roast, making 
the dough of 1% pounds of flour (English pie crust, 
Division S). Butter a deep pie mould and lay in it 
crosswise two pieces of muslin buttered on both sides, 
which will assist in taking the pie out of the mould 
more conveniently. Roll half of the dough moderately 
thick and line the mould with it as directed in No. 2, or 
else! roll into a large flap, line the mould with it and 
trim along the edge. The wild fowl must be previously 
rubbed with a mixture of chopped onions, salt, cloves, 
pepper, sweet basil and wine, put it on thin pork fat 
slices, cover tightly and let it simmer until almost done. 
With tame fowl omit the coarse spices and use nutmeg. 
Hares with the backbone removed and tenderloin (the 
latter pounded) are also divided into pieces, larded, 



186 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

pickled over night according to No. 8 and then sim- 
mered until nearly done. At the same time take 1% 
pounds of veal and pork, half and half, and make a 
forcemeat as directed in No. 8 of this Division. The 
livers and hearts of tame fowl are chopped and added 
to the forcemeat. Then with a knife make an opening 
clear through to the bottom ; roll a cover for the meat 
from some of the remaining dough, trim this cover 
smoothly all around, brush with egg, lay a border On it 
and also brush it, ornament the top of the pie with 
figures made from scraps of dough and then cut an 
opening in the center about the size of a penny. Accord- 
ing to the contents of the pie it must bake from 2J£— 3 
hours. If it should begin to color too soon, cover it 
with a piece of buttered paper. If the contents of the 
pie consist of wild fowl, add to it a brown meat gravy 
or truffle sauce poured into it from the Opening in the 
top. After the pork fat slices have been removed as , 
much as possible, the opening must again be closed. 
For tame fowl take an oyster-, anchovy-, caper- or 
mushroom sauce, in which the broth of the stewed meat 
can be utilized. This pie can also be served cold; in 
this case pour 1 — 2 cupfuls of strong bouillon into the 
opening through a funnel as soon as the pie ( is taken 
out of the oven ; when the pie is cold close the opening 
with a little wad of paper. » 

12. Mock Turtle Pie. Take 2 pounds of flour for a 
puff paste as described in Division S, cut it into 2 parts 
of unequal size, for the bottom roll the smallest piece 
about Vw of an inch thick, lay the dish in. which the 
pie is to be baked on the dough and cut the latter 
to the size of the dish ; this flap is then placed into the 
dish, which must first be buttered. Form a few sheets 
of paper into the shape of a ball and cover it smoothly 
with a few damp napkins and put the ball so formed on 
the bottom of the middle of the dish so that the inner 
space of the pie can be raised as desired, or else the 
space can also be filled with dried peas. The remainder 
of the dough is then also rolled to the thickness of the 
under crust, and large enough so that a rim about 
2 inches wide can be cut from around the edge of the 

Eie. The upper crust is put onto the dish over the 
all in the center; brush with egg and then put on the 



Large Meat Pies. 187 

rim which is also brushed on top but not on the sides. 
Bake for % hour, then cut out the cover nice and round, 
remove the contents carefully so that the crust will not 
be injured, fill in a ragout and cover with the top crust. 
The finished pie is theu immediately filled with the mock 
turtle ragout, D. No. 79, which should be rather thick. 
To simplify matters a puff paste cover need only be 
prepared, which is then used to cover a ragout filled 
into a deep dish. 

13. Forcemeat Pie. For this pie take 1% pounds of 
flour for a puff paste and make a forcemeat as follows: 
1 pound of beef, 1 pound of veal, 1 pound of pork and 
1 pound of bacon are finely chopped together with the 
requisite amount of salt, and then mix with it 8 eggs 
beaten to a froth, nutmeg, white pepper, a chopped 
onion stewed in butter, finely chopped sweet herbs, 
about % — % pound of cracker crumbs and afewcupfuls 
of wine or bouillon. Then line a meat pie mould to the 
top with crust and fill in the forcemeat, put on the rim 
and upper crust, finish it with an ornament and brush 
with an egg. Cut an opening in the top for a vent and 
serve with a caper-, oyster-, mushroom-, anchovy- or 
brown meat sauce. 

14. Hot Heat Pie of Spring Chickens, Pigeons or 

Veal. First make a hollow pie crust as described in 
No. 12, and a fine fricassee of chicken, doves or veal as 
described in Df No. 75, and fill it into the crust with 
some of the gravy, serving the remainder in a boat. 
Veal fricassee can be improved by the addition of sweet- 
bread dumplings (Division 0). 

15. English Meat Pie. For a pie sufficient for 8 
persons take % pound of flour, 3 heaping tablespoonfuls 
of butter, 1 egg and % cupful of cold water, make up 
into a well kneaded dough and then divide it into two 
unequal parts, roll the smallest piece and cut it into 
strips about 1% inches wide with which line a buttered 
pan. Then take cold roast meat, poultry or meat rem- 
nants of various kinds, cut up into sjnall pieces, put a 
few slices of pork fat into the bottom of the pan and 
the meat on these, adding salt, ground cloves and meat 
dumplings according to taste. Pour 1—2 cupfuls of 
strong bouillon over the meat, roll the other piece of 



188 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

dough to a round flap a little larger than the dish, and 
cover the meat with it; turnthe projecting edge of the 
flap inwards and press it against the edge with both 
fingers to form a rim. Brush the whole with egg, make 
two incisions into the top and then babe the pie for 
1 — V/4, hours. Send to the table in the dish in which it 
was baked. 

16. Fine Heat Pie. Not only mutton, but also beef 
tenderloin or the best cuts of any kind of meat can be 
used for this pie. Ordinarily it is .baked in the oven in 
a buttered porcelain dish and lined with puff paste. 

For a mutton pie use the chops near the neck. Cut 
away the fat and remove the skin, take out the. bones, 
pound the meat until tender, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and add a few finely chopped onions. , 

Veal is treated in the same manner, omitting the 
onions, but some chopped bacon and. about 1 cupful to 
1 pint of meat broth are added. 

For a pigeon pie the pigeon should be cut. up and 
boned, seasoned with salt, finely chopped onions, and 
slices of lean ham; fill the mould with sour cream in- 
stead of water. .,.....;.: , ,... 

For all of the above pies make a puff paste, taking 
% pound of flour, according to 1 the, preceding directions, 
rolling part of it for a cover. ' Then butter the bottom 
of a mould, liijie it with a crust, fill to the top with the 
meat, alternately sprinkling in a laygr of fine bread 
crumbs and salt. Then pour in enough water with 
dissolved extract of beef to nearly cover the meat, turn 
back the projecting edges of the crust and put on the 
top crust, which should be large enough to closely cover 
the pie and then bake in the oven from 1—V4, hours. 

17. Mac* roni Pie with Ham and Cheese. See Divi- 
sion I. 

18. Crab Pie or Fricassee with Pie. See D, No. 181.

19. Fresh Fish Pie. Clean and bone the fish, wash 
and cut into pieces. Eemove the gall bag from the 
livers, set the fish aside in salt for a few hours and put 
them into a pickle as described in No. 8, until the next 
day, after which they are dried with a cloth, put into a 
frying pau. with a large piece of butter, leaving them 



Large Meat Pies. 189 

long enough to stiffen; they must not be soft. Have 
ready a puff or butter paste, taking 1&—2 pounds of 
flour and the following forcemeat: 3 pounds of fish 
cleaned and boned, salt, chop finely and then heat thor- 
oughly with the butter some chopped onions -or escha- 
lots. Add % pounds of wheat bread soaked in water 
and pressed, together with eggs and stir the mass over 
the fire until it no longer adheres to the kettle, after 
which let it cool. Then mix with it % pound of butter 
stirred to a cream, 3 more eggs, nutmeg and finely 
chopped parsley. If this forcemeat should be too solid, 
which can easily be tested by rolling a little of it into a 
ball and boiling it in hot water, add a little cream or 
cold water. Then roll the bottom crust as directed in 
No. 10, spread some of the forcemeat on it, cover this 
with pieces of the fish, put on another layer of force- 
meat and so on alternately. Towards the center the 
contents, like those of all other pies, must be raised 
somewhat, the last layer of forcemeat be covered with 
pork fat slices, and a round opening left in the middle of 
the contents of the pie. For the rest the pie is moulded 
and baked like No. 11 . Send to the table with a crab-, 
oyster-, or anchovj' sauce or else with a sauce made as 
follows and of which, as usual, a few cupfuls are put 
into the pie: Lightly brown some flour in butter and 
stir With it bouillon, salt, mace, lemon peel, or instead 
of the latter some of the pickle; when crab tails or 
pickerel livers are handy, chop and add thein to the 
gravy; they should not be cooked but stirred in at last. 
Some of the forcemeat can be reserved and colored red 
with the crab butter or else it may be colored green by 
tbe addition of spinach, which has been cooked and 
rubbed through a sieve. Then roll the forcemeat into 
little balls the size of marbles, but cook in meat broth 
or salted water and put them into the gravy ; into the 
latter stir some finely chopped parsley and the yolks of 
a few eggs. 

20. Pie of Whole Fishes. After cleaning the fish, 
bone them as follows : Slit them down the back with a 
sharp knife, clean 6ut the inside and wash carefully, 
remove all bones, cut off the head, taking care not to 
injure the skin under the body, then pickle according to 
No. 19, fill with the same forcemeat and arrange them 



190 E.— Meat and (jame Pies, Etc. 

oil a bottom crust covered with pork fat slices. For 
the rest proceed according to No, 11. ( 

21. Eel Pie is made according to the receipt No. 
19, the spine, however, is, not "taken out of the eel and 
a few minced sage /leaves are, added to the forcemeat. 
If you have no fish to make the forcemeat with, bread 
crumbs with pieces of butter under and oyer the eel 
may be substituted. The crust for this pie must not;be 
too rich; "Good crust for pie and pastry"., Division S, 
is" suitable. 

22. Salmon Pie: Clean the 'fish, cut it into slices, 
piokle for a few hours according to NO. 19 and get it 
hot in the broth. Prepare a forcemeat according to 
No. 19 and take % pound of flour for , a puff paste and 
roll it. Butter the mOuld, put in half of the forcemeat, 
spreading it evenly to the thickness of % inch, put oh 
the salmon slices and cover them with the rest of the 
forcemeat, then cover with the' puff paste, finish it with 
ar edge and other ornaments and make several incis- 
io is in the top. Bake the pie for 1%— 2 hours. 

• Send to the table With the same sauces described in 
No. 19; a good crab sauce, however, will probably be 
the nicest. 

23. Russian Salmon Pie. Take 2% pounds of salmon 
and remove the skin, bone and cut into thin slices. 
Spritikfe, the latter with salt, pepper and nutmeg and 
let them simmer in butter with sweet herbs until about 
half done. A large goose liver first laid in milk is Cut 
into "slices and stewed in butter; boil a dozen eggs hard, 
and cook % pound of rice in good bouillon with butter 
and salt until tender. When this is ready butter the 
mould, line it with a butter paste, spread the bottom 
and the sides with rice and then put in half of the 
salmon. Sprinkle over them the eggs grated, next put 
in some of the goose liver slices also sprinkled with egg 
and continue in this manner until everything is used. 
Then brush the butter in which the fish and goose liver 
was stewed over the top layer, cover with, rice, then 
cover the top with slices of pork fat and bake in the 
oven to a golden brown. 

Send to the table with a crab sauce. 



Large Meat Pies. 191 

24. Cold Veal Pie. Take a piece of veal weighing 
about 2—3 pounds, cut it into cubes and cook it with 
wine and salt until half done. Then add a few bay 
leaves, cloves, pepper, mushrooms, a celery root and an 
onion, cover and cook slowly for an hour. Get ready; a 
pig's liver, first soaking it in hot water and then chop 
it very fine, strain in order to remove all skin and then 
mix with 1, pound of chopped pork, salt, pepper, nut- 
meg, mace, pounded thyme, majOram, capers, and v 2 
whole eggs, and add the mushrooms which have been 
cooked with the veal- and then finely chopped, to this 
forcemeat, which must be well mixed. Then take the 
veal from the stove, put it on a sieve,, put the broth 
back on the fire, cover and cook thoroughly. The pie 
mould is lined with pork, then put in a layer of force- 
meat, then some of the veal arid continue in. this way 
with a layer of the forcemeat oh top. Pour some of the 
veal sauce between each layer and then bake with a 
good fire for 3 hours. After taking the pie out of the 
mould the pork slices are cut away all around; then 
with a sharp knife divide the pie into neat slices and 
serve with bread and butter. 

25. Picnic Pie. Prepare a hollow Crust as described 
in No. 12 arid in the meantime fry 12 small tenderloin 
beef steaks nicely brown in butter ; boil 1 eggs until 
hard and cut them into dices with about 6 ounces Of 
boiled ham and stew 20 small mushrooms in bouillon 
until tender. Take off the top crust and then fill in 
with beefsteaks, ham, eggs, and mushrooms in layers, 
cover eachlayerwith button onions and capers and drip 
over it a few spoonfuls of meat jelly. The jelly is made 
by cooking the meat bouillon and mushroom broth 
with 1 pint of water, % glassful of Portwine, 1 spoonful 
of estragon vinegar (the latter can be omitted if a sour 
flavor is deemed undesirable), and % teaspoonful of 
extract of beef. Stir % teaspoonful' of dissolved white 
gelatine through this mixture and use the jelly when 
half cool. Let the pie stand in a cool place for a day 
after putting on the cover before serving it. A Remou- 
lade sauce can be added according to taste.

II. SMALL MEAT PIES OR PATTIES. 

26. Baking small Heat Pies. A puff paste is the 
best, but a butter crust may also be taken. Roll it out 
thin, arid with a tumbler cut as many tops and bottoms 
as there are to be patties ; put half of these flaps into a 
baking pan lined, with paper and then with a smaller 
glass cut out the centers, thus forming the rims. Before 
these are placed on the patties the edges of the lower 
crust should be brushed with cold wa,ter to make them 
adhere better. 

The patties are filled according to directions either 
before or after baking. 

Have a medium fire and after the elapse of about 
10 minutes break the upper crust of one of the patties 
to ascertain whether they are done or not. The force- 
meat should be thick but not stiff and be filled into the 
patties while hot; when the latter are made with puff 
paste they must previously be indented somewhat in 
the center. Send to the table hot.. 

27. Puff Paste Ornaments (Fleurons) are used to 
decorate a dish of ragout or are served separately with 
the latter. Roll puff paste to the thickness of about 
Vis of an inch, stamp out with a wineglass or other 
utensil, brush the pieces with diluted egg, turn them 
over in the shape of a half moon, brush the upper side 
of these also and bake to a light brown. 

28. Chicken Patties. Take % pound of roast chicken 
(weighed after being boned), 2 tablespoohfuls of capers, 
6 freshened and finely chopped anchovies, % pound of 
butter, the yolks of 4 eggs, % pound of wheat bread 
soaked in bouillon and pressed, afew spoonfuls of stroDg 
roast meat gravy, a little salt and the whites of 2 eggs 
beaten to a froth. 

Chop this to a smooth forcemeat and fill into patty 
moulds lined with butter paste; bake with a good fire 
for 15 minutes until done. 

29. Nice Chicken or Veal Patties with Cheese. Cook 
a strong, nicely prepared ragout in a scant broth and 
stir it up with the yolks of several eggs. Roll butter 
crust very thin and line with it the patty moulds; fill 



Small Meat Pies or Patties. 193 

the mould one-half with the meat cut into small pieces, 
adding some of the sauce and bake with a medium fire 
for fully % hour ; during this time stir a piece of melted 
butter about the size of a walnut, 2 whole eggs, some 
thick sour cream and grated Holland cheese to a thick 
sauce, fill 2 teaspoonfuls into each patty and bake for 
Y± hour longer. 

30. Sweetbread Patties. 1 veal sweetbread is suffi- 
cient for 4 — 5 persons. Set on the fire in cold water 
and as soon as it begins to boil take it out and put it 
into cold water again, remove the skin*, fry in butter 
with a few eschalots, chop finely and then mix together 
with wheatbread soaked in cold water and then pressed, 
3 eggs, of which half of the whites are beaten to a froth, 
lemons, a large piece of butter stirred to a cream, and, 
according to taste, a few freshened and chopped ancho- 
vies ; a number of oysters with their liquor can also be 
added. Fill the patties before they are baked, which.is 
done as directed in the first patty receipt. 

31. Veal Patties. Mince a piece of cold veal very 
finely, season with nutmeg and salt, put it on the fire 
and stir up with a good-sized piece of crab butter, or 
instead of this with fresh butter and some good meat 
gravy, bouillon or sour craam to a rather thick force- 
meat, and after taking from the fire, stir through it the 
yolk of an egg. If you have no crab butter stir through 
the forcemeat at last some chopped parsley, but omit 
the parsley if crab butter is used. A teaspoonful is filled 
as soon as possible into each patty. 

32. Anchovy Patties. Cut roast veal into small 
dice or chop it very fine, chopped eschalots are lightly 
browned in butter with a little flour, season the meat 
with salt, nutmeg and lemon juice, then add to the 
eschalots together with some good roast meat gravy 
or strong bouillon to make a smooth forcemeat ; after 
the latter has been stirred over the fire until thick, add 
the anchovy finely chopped with some fresh butter— they 
should not cook: hut only become thoroughly hot— and 
stir with the yolks of a few eggs and some white wine. 
Fill this forcemeat into the patties while very hot and 
send them hot to the table. 



194 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

33. Oyster Patties. Stir a large piece of crab butter 
or when this is lacking, a piece of fresh butter to a 
cream, addin proportiontheyoIUspf 2— 3 eggs, lemon 
juice, mace and salt, the liquor of the oysters (3 — 4 oys- 
ters for each person), furthermore chopped mushrooms, 
capers, rolled , crackers and finely chopped roast vea\ 
with good roast veal gravy. Half of the whites of the 
eggs are beaten to a froth and stirred through at last. 
H the forcemeat should be too stiff, add a Tittle sour 
cream or strong bouillon or white wine. Fill the patties 
before baking, and after they, have been in the oven, 
which should «be moderately hot, for 10 minutes, lay 
3— i oysters on top of each patty after brushing the 
latterwithegg yolk and lemon juice and sprinkling with 
very finely, rolled cracker crumbs; then. bake for 5 min- 
utes longer. . . . 

34. Crab ' Patties. Stew a few eschalots in butter 
and brown, in it a tablespqohful of fiour, add some 
strong boiling bouillon and coOk for a short time with 
the addition of 5— 6 carefully washed and finely chopped 
truffles or mushrooms. Cook % pound of veal sweet-' 
breads in bouillon until done, remove the skin and 
,'fleshy parts, cut the sweetbreads into small cubes and 
add to the bouillo'n. Cook all of this together until 
smooth, add 30 crab tails chopped into little cubes,.stir 
with the yolks of 2 eggs and fill into the baked patties. 

35. Brown Gravy Patties. Put a piece of butter 
into the kettle and add 1 pound of lean beef, 1 pound of 
veal and 1 pound of lean ham all cut into pieces, stew 
in the butter until lightbrown and then add the onions, 
2, carrots, part of a celery root, --(all sliced), together 
with some mace and 4 cloves, pour in some extract of 
beef bpoth, cover tightly and let it cook slowly until 
the meat is, tender and the gravy amounts to only 
.about 1 pint. Press the meat in a clean cloth until dry 
and let.the gravy stand until clear, after. whi.ch pour it 

, off carefully from the settlings. Then beat up 12 fresh 
eggs, gradually stir in the above mentioned quantity of 
r gravy and pass through a sieve. This gravy is filled 
into half the depth of small buttered tin moulds or cups 
'/■as, cylindrical and highin shape as possible, stand into 
boiling water reaching to half their height and cook 



Small Meat Pies ok Patties. 195 

until the contents are firm. Turn the patties onto an 
appropriate platter and Sprinkle them with lean ham 
and parsley chopped together very finely. 

These patties can be made from remnants of meat of 
most any kind, and the admixture of the meat of game, 
for instance of wild hare, will be found an improvement. 

36. Rice Patties. Thoroughly scalded rice is cooked 
with milk and salt until tender and firm; in the mean- 
time mix some finely chopped boiled ham. with sour 
cream, butter and dredge small moulds with cracker 
crumbs, fill them with the ham, rice and Parmesan 
cheese in alternate layers and bake. 

37. Hasty Patties made from fleat Remnants. Chop 
some remnants of veal roast or any other kind very 
finely together with some fat meat, such as ham, add 
nutmeg, ,salt, a piece of butter, a few eggs, parsley or 
some minced eschalots or onions and stir all on the fire 
to a smooth forcemeat. Cut the upper crust from rolls 
or rusks, take out the center, fill in the forcemeat, cover 
with the top crust and bake. 

38. Mushroom Patties. Grate off the brown outer 
crust from small rolls, cut them into halves, take out the 
center, soak them in milk in which an egg has been 
beaten and then turn in the crumbs. For each roll take 
1 — 2 large mushrooms; clean the latter very carefully 
and cut the heads into, pieces about % inch in size. 
Mince the other parts of the mushrooms with parsley, 
burnet a nd tarragon, rub a finely chopped eschalot in 
butter and then add the mince together with the salt, 
pepper, a little grated lemon peel, a little over K ounce 
of very finely chopped fresh bacon, several whole eggs, 
a few spoonfuls of roast meat gravy and ltablespoonful 
of Portwine, and mix all of this with the pieces of mush- 
rooms. Fill some of the forcemeat into the .rolls, dredge 
the surface with bread crumbs, put a piece of crab but- 
ter on each half roll, sprinkle Vith a few drops of lemon, 
juice and then bake the patties in the oven with a very 
moderate fire. 

39. Patties in floulds. Butter a lot of small tin 
moulds and fill them to three-fourths of their depth with 
the forcemeat described for the ragout pie under No. 7; 



196 E.— Meat and Game Pies, Etc. 

press the forcemeat towards the sides and bottom of 
the mould to form a hollow, into which fill a table- 
spoonful of the ragout prepared as directed in the re- 
ceipt mentioned (No. 7). Then spread enough of the 
forcemeat over the top to completely cover the ragout, 
cover each patty with a piece- of buttered paper and 
stand them in hot water, which should not come higher 
than half the depth of the mOuld, for % hour before 
serving. To cook the patties until they are done the 
water should not be more than boiling hot, and the 
vessel in which they stand must be covered./ After turn- 
ing them out of the moulds, put a round slice of truffles 
or beef tongue on each patty. Serve after the soup 
with or without a sauce. 

40. Baked Chicken Patties. Take the tenderest 
parts of 2 baked Spring chickens, chop finely and mix 
with 4 tablespoonfuls of thick Bechamel sauce and the 
yolks of 6 eggs; if the mass should be too thick add a 
littlecream, and if too thin, bread crumbs; fill into small 
buttered cups. Stand in a double kettle, leaving them 
there until done and firm, which will take about 20 min- 
utes, then turn them out, cover with a crab sauce and 
serve. 

41 . Talleyrand Patties. Butter a lot of small patty 
moulds and line with truffles cut in the shape of noodles, 
and beef tongue slices. Mince remnants of baked chick- 
ens together with a few stewed mushrooms, some bacon 
and a little boiled ham, mix this with a few eggs, salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, bread crumbs and spread the interior 

s of the moulds thickly with this forcemeat. Fill the 
center with a thick mushroom ragout which is prepared 
by stewing small mushrooms in butter and meat broth 
until done, cutting veal sweetbreads into cubes and 
heating both in brown meat gravy. Spread a layer of 
forcemeat over the ragout,' then cook the patties in a 
double boiler for % hour, turn them out of the moulds, 
cover with Madeira sa"uce and serve. 

Meat pies and patties are not adapted for the sick- 
room, because they are too rich and not easily digest- 
ible.

1. General Directions for Preparing and Cooking 
Fish, together with a Table showing when they are in 
Season: All fresh water and unsalted fish should be 
prepared while quite fresh; they become taiuted very 
rapidly and are then absolutely unpalatable and un- 
wholesome. A fish is best when placed on the market 
immediately after being caught and cleaned. Fish in- 
jured in catching are sometimes allowed to remain iii 
water to keep them alive; this is not only cruel, but 
when it dies slowly, it is detrimental to the quality of

continues so only for a few hours; and it bears therefore 
a much higher price in the market then, than when 
mellowed by having been kept a day or two. 

The flesh of the codfish should be white and clear 
before it is hoiled^ whiter still after it "is boiled and 
firm though tender, sweet and mild in flavor, and separ- 
ated jea sil.y in flakes. Many persons consider it rather 
improved "than otherwise by having a little salt rubbed 
along the inside of the backbone and letting it lie from 
twenty-four to twenty-eight h^urs before it is dressed. 
It is sometimes served crimp like salmon, and must 
then be sliced as soon as dead, or within the shortest 
time possible afterwards. 

Herrjjjgs^jnackerel and whitings lose their fresh- 
ness so rapidly that unless newly caught they are quite 
uneatable. The herring may, it is said, be deprived of 
the strong smell which it emits when broiled or fried, by

Eels should be alive and brisk in movement when 
they are purchased; they are easily killed by piercing 
the spinal marrow close to the back part of the skull 
with a sharp pointed knife, or skewer. If this be done 
in the right place all motion will instantly cease. Boil- 
ing water will also immediatel y cause vitality to cease, 
and is perhaps tJne~most humane~and ready method of 
destroying the fish.

Small plump "vanetiea are always preferable to the 



larger ana coarser kinds. 

To clean Fish. Let this be done always with the 
most scrupulous nicety, for nothing can more effectu- 
ally destroy the appetite than fish sent to the table 
imperfectly cleaned. Handle it lightly, and never thr ow 
it roughly about, so as t o bruise it; wash Tt well, Tout 
do not leave it longer in the waUlr than is necessary, for 
fish, like meat, l oses it flavor from being soaked. W hen 
scales are to be removed, lay the fish flat upon its side, 
and hold it firmly with the left hand, while they are 
scraped off with the right; turn it, and when both sides 
are done, pour or pump sufficient water over it to float 
off all the loose scales ; then proceed to open and empty 
it. Be sure that not the slightest particle of offensive 
matter be left in t he his.ide f wash out the blood entirely. . 
and scrape or brush it away, if needful from the back- 
bone. This may be easily accomplished without open- 
ing the fish so much as to render it unsightly when it is 
sent to the table. The red mullet is dressed without 
being emptied, and smelts are drawn at the gills. When 
the scales are left on, the outside of the fish should be 
well washed and wiped with a coarse towel, drawn 
gently from the head to the tail. Eeja^to be whole- 
some, sh ould ha skinned, but they are sometimes 
dressed without; Doiling water should then be poured 
upon them,, and they should be left in it for five or ten 
minutes, before they are cut up. The da rk.skin of the

To keep Fish. All the smaller kinds of fish keep best 
if emptied and cleaned as soon as they are brought in, 
then wiped gently as dry as they can be and hung sep- 
arately by the head on the hooks in the ceiling of a cool 
larder) or in the open air when the weather will allow.

adapted to the purpose. Soles in winter will Remain 
good a couple of days when thus prepared; and even 
whitings and mackerel may be kept so without losing 
any of their excellence. Salt may be rubbed slightly 
over codfish, and weft along the backbone, but it injures 
the flavor of salmon, the inside of which may be rubbed 
with vinegar, and peppered instead. When excessive 
sultriness renders all of these modes unavailing, the fish 
must at once be partially cooked to preserve it, but 
this should be avoided if possible, as it is very rarely sc 
good when this method is resorted to. 

To sweeten taintea Fish. The application of pyr- 
oligneous acid will effect this when the taint is but 
slight. A wineglassful, miked with two of water, may 
be poured over the fish, and rubbed upon the parts 
more particularly requiring it; it must then be left for 
some minutes untouched, and afterwards washed in 
several waters, and soaked until the smell of the acid is 
no longer perceptible. The chloride of soda, from its 
powerful antiputrescent properties, will have more effect 
when the fish is in a worse state. It should be applied 
in the same manner, and will not at all injure the flavor 
of the fish, which is not fit food when it cannot be per- 
fectly purified by either of these means. The chloride 
may be diluted more or less, as occasion may require. 

Salting and cooking Fish. Careful use of Bay Leaves. 

The proper application of salt — neither too much nor 
too little^ind the art of cooking fish until done with- 
out permitrang them to become too soft, is a test cf a

Fresh Water Fish. 201 

To bake or fry Fish Fish should always be baked 
in an open pan with plenty of butter ; the fire should 
not be too strong, so that they will bake through and 
through, and not scorch on the outside while the inside 
remains raw. Serve on a warm, uncovered dish. 

For fish in jelly, see Division M. 

Fish are in season as follows : Salmon from May to 
August; can be obtained earlier but are scarce. 

Eels are in season all the year,, but .not in prime con- 
dition in April and May. 

Pike and perch are in the best condition from Sep- 
tember to January. 

Garp are best from October to the end of March. 

Shad, April, May and early part of June. 

Trout, May to August. 

Red mullet through the Summer, but may be had 
all the year. 

Crab and lobster, April to October. 

Haddock — best season, October, November and 
December, but in the market to the end of April. 

Turbot in season all the year. ' 

Soles are the best from theend of April to September. 

It would be impracticable to give rules for cooking 
every kiud of fish ; they are too numerous. Suffice is to 
say that the directions for cooking one will apply to 
any other of the same size. 



I. FRESH WATER FISH. 

2. Boiled Salmon. Scale, empty and wash the fish 
with great care. Cut into slices about 1^—2 inches 
thick, put on the fire in boiling water with salt, pepper- 
corns, whole and ground cloves, a few bay leaves and 
lemon peel; cook for a few minutes, skimming thor- 
oughly. Let it stand on the back of the stove until the 
fins pull out easily, which will indicate that the fish is 
done. Send to the table with potatoes, melted butter, 
which should not bubble but. simply be hot, minced 
parsley and the grated yolks of hard boiled eggs. 



202 F— Fish and Shell Fish. 

Boiled salmon may also be served with a Bearnese-, 
yellow caper-, oyster- or Hollandaise sauce ; a few drops 
of lemon juice should be added to the melted butter. 

■ If the salmon is to be served cold with oil and ' 
vinegar, take the pieces out of the kettle, let them cool 
and immediately put them into a pickle of some of the 
cold fish broth, olive oil, vinegar, pepper and salt. Less 
salt is required for cooking salmon' than for any other 
fish. 

3. Salmon with Savory Herbs. , Clean the fish thor^ 
oughly and cut it into pieces, sprinkle with salt and let 
it stand for 1 hour. .Then mix the following herbs: 
Parsley, eschalots and capers, together with freshened 
and boned anchovy and ground pepper and put them 
into fresh melted butter with enough lemon juice to 
slightly acidulate it, put it on the fire and when warm 
add the fish and leave it for 2 hours, turning quite 
often; the butter should be melted but must not scorch. 
Heat some butter in another pan and fry the salmon in 
it for l0 minutes, brushing the minced herbs over both 
sides of the fish frequently. 

The sauce is made by boiling the rest of the mari- 
nade with 2 glassf uls of white wine with a few spoonfuls 
of good meat broth, and if it should not be tart enough 
add a, few drops of lemon juice and stir through it the 
yolks of a few eggs. 

4. Pickled Salmon. Take 2 pounds of. salmon and 
without washing or skinning it cut it into slices about 
1 inch thick, put into salt for about 1 hour, dry with a 
cloth, brush with the best olive oil and then fry them 
on a quick fire until done and of a light brown color; 
the slices are then placed into an earthenware jar. Boil 
1 pint of mild vinegar and 1 pint of white wine, % ounce 
oi salt,, 2 lemon slices, 2 bay leaves, tarragon, a pinch 
of white pepper and when this liquor is cool pour it over 
the fish ; cover the jar by tying a cloth over it and let 
it stand until wanted. 

5. Boiled Eels. After the eel has been killed it is not 
taken out of the skin, but the latter is rubbed down 
with salt; the eel is then emptied, cut into pieces and 
hot vinegar poured over it ; afterwards put it on the 
fire with a dash of vinegar, salt, a bay leaf, lemon slices, 



Fresh Water Fish. 203 

eschalots, peppercorns, cloves, a small piece of butter, 
some sage, thyme and tarragon ; cook slowly for 10 or 
15 minutes. Send to the table hot with potatoes, 
butter and mustard; garnish with lemon slices and 
parsley leaves, and serve with it vinegar and olive oil 
or else a horse radish-, caper- or lemon sauce; 

It is advisable to save the eel broth,' because what- 
ever is left over of the eel can be set aside in it. Less 
salt is required for cooking eels than for other fish. 

If the eel is to be kept for any length of time and to 
be served with a Remoulade or other similar sauce, it 
should be cooked in the same manner, only taking vine- 
gar and water half and half. After the eel is cooked 
take it out of the broth until it has cooled completely, 
then put it back again, cover and set aside until 
wanted. Garnish the dish in which the eel is served 
with meat jelly, sliced eggs, beets, capers, pickled 
walnuts, etc. 

6. Fricassee of Eel, Bremen style. Clean the eel as 
directed above, cut into pieces, cover with salt for an 
hour, washing it before cooking. Bring to a boil in a 
slightly salted strong bouillon of which there should be 
enough to nearly cover the eel, add a few mushroom 
slices, cook until the eel is done, take out of the broth 
and set it on the back of the stove. Roll fish forcemeat 
into oblong dumplings, cooking them in the ragout for 
not to exceed 5 minutes. Should there be say 2 pounds 
of the eel, rub some flour and butter, cook in the eel 
broth to a thick sauce, stir through it the yOlks of 2 
fresh eggs, season with lemon juice, a little mace and 
white pepper, stir until it begins to boil, put the eel with 
the dumplings into a warm dish in which they are mixed 
with the gravy. To improve this dish cook a glassful 
of Madeira with the sauce and in addition to the fish 
dumplings, get ready chicken force meat dumplings. 
Stew mushrooms and veal sweetbreads in bouillon untii 
tender, mixing all of these ingredients together with 
crab tails into the fricassee. This fricassee can be 
served in a rice crust, garnishing the top with puff paste 
slices (see under "Meat Pies", Division E.) 

7. Stewed Eel. Cook 2 calf's feet until the meat 
drops from the bones, strain thebroth and immediately 



204 F.— Fish and Shell Fish. 

pour it back into the eleaned kettle, put in the washed 
pieces of eel— they should not be entirely covered with 
the broth— add 2 tablespoonfulg of vinegar in which a 
trifle of extract of beef has been dissolved, together with 
a slip of mace, 2—3 small sliced onions, pepper, salt and 
a few lemon slices without seeds, cover tightly and stew 
slowly until done. Try the broth to determine whether 
it needs more vinegar or salt, then arrange the eel in a 
dish and pour over it the broth, which should be slightly 
cool. 

8. Fried Eel. Salt the pieces, turn in bread, and 
egg crumbs and fry in an open pan in melted butter 
with fresh sage leaves until done— golden brown and 
crisp. 

Or the eel may be covered with salt for a few hours, 
cover and set it aside, dry it with a cloth, wrap it into 
sage leaves, and then fry it in butter, pork fat or olive 
oil. 

Eel is most delicious, however, when baked in the 
oven ; it is then rolled into a coil fastened with thin 
wooden skewers. Put it into a buttered pan and cover 
with sliced onions, pour over it a marinade consisting 
of vinegar j white wine and savory herbs, enough to half 
cover the eel, and then bake in the oven. As soon as 
done lay the eel on a clean cloth which will draw out the 
fat, glaze it with meat jelly and serve with a tomato 
sauce. Eel prepared in this manner is the most whole- 
some, because the greater part of the fat is drawn from 
it. Serve with sliced lemons and mustard or lettuce; 
a Bemoulade sauce is also a fitting accompaniment. 
Eel is also nice when served with early green peas. 

If the eel is a large one the spine can be taken out 
immediately, while it is being prepared, and the pieces 
can then be filled with a .fish or veal forcemeat, after- 
wards tying them so that the forcemeat will not fall 
out ; then bake as directed above. 

9. Rolled Eel. After the eel has been eleaned, cut 
off the fins, slit along the back instead of underneath, 
empty, wash nicely and take out the entire spine. Then 
put the eel on, a chopping board, with the inner side 
turned out, flatten it, sprinkle with minced yolks of 
hard boiled eggs, onions and parsley, pepper and salt, 



. Feesh Wateh Fish. 205 

or instead of the latter cover with anchovy slices. Cut 
the head and tail from the eel and then roll it up, be- 
ginning 1 at the head, and wrap this roll into a piece of 
clean muslin, which should be closed at both ends. Put 
water and vinegar, half and half, into a small kettle, 
and cook the roll with onion slices, spices, 2 bay leaves 
and salt for % hour until done; the liquor should barely 
cover the roll. Afterwards take the roll out of the 
kettle, and draw the muslin, which loosens during the 
cooking, tight again. When cool press the roll slightly 
and unwrap the muslin; the roll should be sliced and 
neatly arranged on the dish, garnish with lemon slices 
and send to the table with meat jelly or a Retnoulade 
sauce. 

1.0. Eel Stew, English Style. Clean the eel, cut off 
the head and tail and the remainder into medium sized 
pieces, which are turned in flour, pepper and salf . Bake 
in butter to a light brOwn. After the eel is cold cook 
the head and tail with some good bouillon, several 
chopped anchovies, a few mushrooms, 1 glassful of wine 
vinegar, 1 glassful of sherry to a strong broth ; strain 
and thicken with flour rubbed in butter. Stew the 
baked eel in this sauce for 15 minutes, send to the table 
in the sauce. 

11. Eel in Cases. Clean a large eel, salt,, cut it into 
pieces and stew until tender in bouillon containing a 
little white wine, mixed spices and savory herbs. In 
the meantime boil about 6 ounces of rice in bouillon 
until tender, finely chop 1 dozen mushrooms, 3 escha- 
lots and some parsley, mix and stew for a few minutes 
in butter; brush the inside of a large paper case with 
olive oil, put a layer of rice on the bottom, then a layer 
of the eel sprinkled with the minced ingredients and 
continue in this manner until the case is filled. The 
last layer should be of rice, dot it with crab butter, 
cover with bread crumbs, and bake with a slow fire for 
\ hour. Serve immediately on a folded napkin. 

12. Pickled Eel. Skin the eel, wash, salt for 1 hour, 
cut into, pieces, dry it with a cloth, fry in a clean pan 
with olive oil, and lay on absorbent or blotting paper 
to cool. Then cook for % of an hour with eschalots, 
peppercorns, mace, a few bay leaves, lemon slices (with- 



206 F.— Fish and Shell, Fish. 

out the seeds) and enough vinegar to cover the eel, to- 
gether with- water and salt. When the liquoris cold 
pour it over the eel; set aside in a cool place Until, 
wanted. Another method is to put the eel in salt for a 
few hours ; then cook it for about 15 minutes until done 
in an enameled kettle in which water and vinegar, half 
and half, and the above mentioned spices, have flr^t 
been brought to a boil; arrange the eel in layers in a 
stone jar, remove the fat from the liquor, acidulate it 
with lemon juice, pour it into the jar and set it aside. 
The fish can be served without any further prepara- 
tion, or else the pieces can be mixed with medium hard 
boiled eggs quartered, small pickles, pickled button 
onions and beets; sprinkle with capers. 

13. To boil Brook Trout with a blue Color. Like all 
other kinds offish that are to have a blue co lor after 
cooking, trout should not be scraged7™s u iffipl"y empty 
them aricTtKTs is done best "By Tayingxheul on a wet 
chopping board and hjindiingjLhjjtii aslittlg^passiUe 
so that the glutenous substance enveloping the fish, 
and which produces the blue color,, will not be rubbed 
off. Afterwards rinse and lay them on a flat dish, pour; 
boiling vinegar over them, and let them stand for half 
an hour in a cool draft. Bring water to a boil with 
plenty of salt, put in thefish with the vinegar, cover the 
kettle and. let it stand on top of the stove for 6—12 
minutes, but the fish must not qook. Serve hot with 
fresh butter, or With melted butter as preferred. They 
can also be sent to the table with minced' parsley or a 
Hollandaise sauce, or they may be served cold, with 
olive oil, vinegar and pepper. Butter used with fish 
must never become hot enough to cook, because it 
thereby loses greatly in quality. 

Brook trout require more salt than most other 
kinds of fish. 

Remake. — Where brook trout are not to be cooked with a blue' color they 
are simply boiled in water according to directions. Brook trout will keep for n 
fgw hours only after being caught, and should therefore be cooked when quite 
fresh. . • 

14. Trout Steaks with various kinds of Sauces and 
Vegetables. Take trout of medium' size, empty, skin and 
bone them and divide into quarters. Put the steaks 
into a buttered pan, sprinkle with salt and minced sav- 



• Fresh Water Fish. 207 

ory herbs, and fry on both sides for 2 minutes. Then 
pour off the butter, add to the fish some pf the sauce 
with which they are to be served, let it come to a boil 
once, arrange the fish in a deep dish and send to the 
table with either a crab-, caper-, tqinato-, Bearnaise- or 
rich brown sauce. Instead of serving with a ■ gravy 
separately, the fish, fried in butter without the addition 
of any herbs, can be served with peas, asparagus or 
other fresh vegetables. 

15. Baked Trout. Select trout of the, smallest size, 
scrape off the scales nicely, empty, and wash. Cut a 
slit about Vie inch deep along each side, salt for % hour 
before baking. Then dry them with a cloth and turn 
them first in flour and then in egg and cracker crumbs, 
fry, serve on a napkin placed over a fish plate. Lettuce 
is a fitting accompaniment. 

16. Carp cooked blue. Empty the fish as directed 
in No. 1, wash, divide lengthwise into halves and cut 
each part into 2 — 3 pieces. Carp can be cooked blue 
the same as trout, and as it is a very fat fish, it should 
be boiled for a few minutes and served quite hot. Send 
to the table with hot melted butter and minced parsley, 
or with a plain horse radish sauce. The milt of carp is 
considered a delicacy. Carp require a great deal of salt. 

17. Carp with a Claret Sauce. When killing the 
carp catch its blood in a small cup half full of vinegar, 
scrape off the scales and proceed as directed in the pre- 
ceding receipt. After washing the pieces put them into 
a saucepan with salt, sliced onions, coarse ground pep- 
per and cloves, sliced lemons and bay leaves, add water 
and enough claret to just cover the fish. Take off the 
scum as carefully as possible, add a large piece of butter 
andfinelyrolled crackers and then cook slowly. Shortly 
before serving stir in the blood and a piece of sugar, put 
the fish into a dish and strain over it the sauce, which 
should be well bound. 

18. , Carp with a Polish Sauce. Kill the carp and 
catch the blood; in vinegar, scrape, divide in half and 
cut each part into pieces. For 8 pounds of fish take 
3 carrots, 1 parsnip, 2 parsley roots, 3 onions and 
y± celery root ; cut everything, into slices and put it into 



208 F.— Fish and Sheli., Fish. 

a saucepan with some ginger, a few cloves, peppercorns 
and about 2 bay leaves, add beer and water half and 
half and boil for % hour. Then put in the fish, add the 
necessary salt and 2 — 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, % of 
a lemon without the seeds, a Wineglassful of vinegar 
(including that mixed with the blood) cover tightly and 
cook for 15 minutes longer. As soon as the fish is 
tender take it out of the broth and set it on the back of 
the stove, add ginger bread ("Pfefferkuchen") or grated 
wheat bread and I glassful of claret to the sauce, strain 
the latter and put part of it on the fish and the remain- 
der into a sauce boat. Serve with potatoes. The beer 
should not be bitter and the sauce quite thick. . 

19. Stuffed Carp. Scrape the scales from the fish, 
empty it and carefully loosen the meat on one side 
between the head and tail, so that both parts remain 
attached to the skin and be careful not to injure the 
latter. After boning the meat that has been cut out, 
chop the latter, very finely, stir a piece of butter to a 
cream, add 2 eggs, some wheat bread soaked in water 
and then pressed, 1 — 2 eschalots,. lemon peel, salt, mace 
and finally the chopped meat of the fish. If this force- 
meat should be too soft add some grated bread and if 
too firm put in some water. Fill this forcemeat into 
the body of the fish so that it will regain its original 
shape, sprinkle with cracker crumbs, put it into.the pan 
with pork fat slices and some butter with the filled side 
to the top and bake in the oven, basting often, until 
brown and done. After the fish has been carefully laid 
on a fish plate cook the gravy in the pan with % table- 
spoonful of flour rubbed in butter, bouillon and salt. 
Season according to taste with chcoped anchovy, 
strain and add capers or lemon peel. If it is possible to 
put a cover containing live embers over tb^ pan, the 
fish will be greatly improved. 

20. Carp and Eel mixed. Take the same quantity 
of both fish (about 2% pounds Of each), scrape and skin 
the fish, cut them into pieces about 2 inches long, salt 
lightly and set aside for an hour. During this time 
cook some pickled pork until half done, cut it into 
pieces the same size as those of the fish and put it all in- 
to a vessel, mixed with small onions and mushrooms 



Fresh Water Fish. 209 

and with about 6 heaping teaspoonf uls of butter added. 
Season with 1 bay leaf, peppercorns and a few cloves, 
add 1 pint of bouillon and the same quantity of claret, 
and stew the whole slowly until done. Set the various * 
ingredients on top of the stove to keep them hot, strain 
the broth, thicken with flour browned in butter and 
pour it over the mixture. Garnish the edge of the dish 
with egg dumplings- and slips of toast and send to the 
table with boiled potatoes. 

21. To bake a whole Carp. Scrape the fish, slit 
down the back but not under the body, empty, salt and 
after an hour dry it with a cloth, sew the back, turn in 
egg and bread crumbs and then fry in a flat pan with 
hot butter or lard until of a golden brown color. Re- 
move the thread and serve. The pan must not be cov- 
ered when frying the fish, otherwise they will become 
soft and this will also be the case if they are not sent to 
the table at once; to draw out the fat, however, they 
should be laid on absorbent or blotting paper for a 
moment. Left-over carp or other fried fish can be uti- 
lized in fish soup (B, No. 25) or with sour cabbage and 
fish. 

22. Hungarian Carp. Prepare the carp and cut it 
into pieces, salt and set aside for 15 minutes, then cook 
them in boiling salted water containing a dash of vine- 
gar, as directed in No. 16, until done. Serve on a hot 
dish and pour over it the following sauce. Brown 2 
chopped onions and % ounce of flour in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of butter, and cook this with a large cupful of sweet 
cream, a small cupful of fish broth and 1 tablespoonful 
of bouillon to a well bound sauce. Season with cayenne 
pepper, being very careful not to take too much. After 
straining the sauce stir through it the yolks of 2 eggs 
and then a piece of fresh butter. 

23. Fillet of Carp. Raise the flesh from the bones of 
a medium-sized fish and chop it finely, mix With some 
shredded bacon, anchovy butter, 2 or 3 eggs, 2 to 8 
spoonfuls of sour cream, salt, pepper and enough grated 
bread to make a smooth but not crumby forcemeat, 
which is shaped into the form of a loaf. Lard along the 
top closely with small pork fat lardoons, sprinkle the 
surface with bread crumbs and bake in the oven in

butter with frequent basting until done. % of an hour 
before serving add a cupful of sour cream. Thicken the 
sauce with cornstarch and send the fish to the table 
with boiled potatoes and lettuce. 

24. Cold Carp with a Sauce. After the fish has been 
cleaned and emptied, nicely rinsed and salted for an 
hour, put it into a frying pan with a large cupful of 
wine, spices, tarragon, parsley and 1% tablespoonfuls of 
butter, baste and cook slowly until done. After it is 
cool put a Remoulade sauce or sauce a la Diable, (Divi- 
sion K), into the dish with the fish and garnish around 
the sides with eggs and parsley. 

25. Carp in Mayonnaise Sauce. Take a fish weigh- 
ing 4 to 4% pounds, rub it with salt and stew it slowly 
until done with a large cupful of wine, salt, pepper, 
spices, onion, a small bunch of parsley and 1% table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Leave in the broth until cold, and 
make a good thick Mayonnaise sauce as directed under 
Division ; after the fish is taken out of the broth and 
dried, cover it evenly with the sauce. Garnish the dish 
with sliced eggs, capers, button onions, gherkins and 
parsley, and surround with a border of meat jelly. 
Serve for supper. 

26. Pickled Carp. Clean and empty the fish and 
cut the gall bag from* the liver. Wash, ruB on the in- 
and outside with salt and let it lay for a while. Put the 
roes back into the fish and dry it. It can also be divided 
in two and cut into pieces. Then brush.with olive oil. 
broil slowly until done and of a golden brown color ; if 
you have no broiler a sauce- or frying pan will answer 
the purpose,, but in this case it must be shaken fre- 
quently, so that the fish will not adhere to the pan. 
Let it cool, boil vinegar with lemon peel, eschalots or 
onions, whole spices, mace, some salt and a bay leaf, 
and after the liquor is cold pour it over the fish. After 
a few days, the carp can' be sent to the table; it will 
keep for several weeks if the liquor is boiled once more 
in the meantime. 

27. Perch Hollandaise. The fish is scraped under 
the body only and emptied, leaving the milt and liver 
in the fish, rinse carefully and boil for 5 minutes in a 



Fresh Water Fish. 211 

little salted water, in which a piece of butter, pepper- 
corns, and plenty of small parsley roots with a few 
sprigs of parsley have been previously cooked until 
done. When serving the fish the parsley roots should 
be interspersed between them ; send to the table hot in 
the broth in which they were cooked. If sent to the 
table without the broth, then serve with melted butter 
and chopped parsley, grated yolks of eggs, and mus- 
tard, or with a Hollandaise sauce, using some of the 
strained fish broth in making the sauce. 

28. Another method of boiling Perch. The perch 
are scraped all over; empty and put them on the fire in 
boiling salted water with onions, peppercorns and bay 
leaves and cook until done. Then mince 2 hard boiled 
eggs with parsley, stir in some nutmeg and rolled crack- 
ers, put the fish into a dish, dredge with the above 
mixture and send them to the table with hot melted 
butter with either a caper-, Maitre de Hotel- or a brown 

. herb sauce. 

29. Perch in a French Sauce. Take perch weighing 
about % pound apiece, scrape, empty and wash nicely, 
salt and put them into a saucepan with plenty of but- 
ter. As soon as they are heated on both sides dredge 
some flour over them, turn the fish in the flour and add 
enough white wine to cover. At the same time add 
finely ground cloves, minced parsley and eschalots, 
cover tightly and let the fish cook slowly until done, 
but they must not fall to pieces. • 

30. Blue Pike with Butter and Horse Radish. Se- 
lect fish of a small size, empty and bend them with 
their tails in their mouths. They should not be handled 
much, however, because otherwise the blue color cannot 
be given them. They are then cooked blue as directed 
in No. 13, but should remain on the fire longer than 
trout. Send to the table garnished with sprigs of pars- 
ley and a few apples ; in addition to melted butter serve 
grated horse radish prepared with vinegar, sugar and 
hard boiled eggs. The liver of the pike, which is con- 
sidered a great delicacy, must not be forgotten, being 
careful, of course, to first remove the gall bag. Salt the 
same as perch. 



212 F.— Fibh and Shell Fish. 

In England the fish is cut into pieces and is then 
cooked in boiling salted water with vinegar, butter and 
spices until tender, sprinkled with grated horse radish 
and covered with plenty of browned butter. 

Instead of being served with butter, pike may be 
sent to the table with a caper-, Hollandaise-, or sour 
egg sauce. 

31. Stewed Pike. With a sharp knife shave the 
scales close to the skin to leave the latter white, divide 
the fish in two and cut up each half to the size desired, 
wash nicely and cook in salted water for 5 minutes and 
put into another kettle. In the meantime boil some 
capers in white wine with some fish broth, lemon juice 
and lemon peel, a good-sized piece of butter and some 
grated wheat bread, pour over the fish and let it stew 
in this gently for 15 minutes.. The sauce can be slightly 
seasoned with anchovy if wished. Then stir with it the 
yolk of an egg and send to the table as hot as possible. 

32. Larded Pike. Take a fish of medium size, clean 
and skin it, lard on both sides closely with fine lardoons 
and sprinkle with fine salt. The fish is then baked as 
follows, either in its natural form or with the tail in- 
serted in its mouth : Melt plenty of butter in a frying 
pan, put in the fish, baste it thoroughly and bake until 
done and nicely brown ; have a slow fire, but the" cover 
of 1he pan should be so arranged as to hold live embers. 
The fish can, however, be as nicely baked in the oven in 
the open pan; it is then frequently dredged with grated 
wheat bread and basted with several spoonfuls of sour 
cream. In this case the juices in the pan are made into 
a gravy "with the addition of some extract of beef, a 
little Portwine, lemon juice and thickened with flour 
rubbed in butter and used instead of the browned caper 
sauce. 

Larded pike baked according to the directions first 
given should be served, with a brown caper sauce made 
with some anchovy and plenty of lemon juice; pour 
some of it into a hot dish and put in the fish. The rest 
of the gravy together with the browned gravy in the 
pan is sent to the table with it. 

33. Chopped Baked Pike. The spine is taken out of 
the fish in such a'manner that the head and tail remain 



Fresh Water Fish. 213 

attached to the body. Put the spine into an earthen- 
ware dish and lay the meat into boiling water for a few 
minutes, after which all the other bones can be easily 
removed. Then chop the meat very finely and make 
into a forcemeat with the addition of a large piece of 
butter, 2 eggs, grated wheat bread, mace and salt. 
Press this forcemeat onto the spine so that it wil ne 
moulded into the original form of the fish, sprinkle with 
cracker crumbs and bake in the oven. Baste frequently 
with butter, being careful not to wash away the cracker 
crumbs and season with lemon juice. If the fish comes 
to the table on a hot platter, serve it with a caper- or 
anchovy sauce. Other varieties of fish can be chopped 
and served in the same way. 

34. Baked Pike. After cleaning the fish nicely, split 
the larger ones, cut them into pieces, and leave the 
smaller ones whole, removing the heads and tails. Slit 
them closely, but only through the upper skin, and salt. 
After the elapse of }| hour dry them with a cloth, turn 
in egg and bread crumbs and then fry crisply to a 
golden brown in an open pan in which plenty of butter 
or lard has been heated. 

To prevent the fish from becoming soft again, it 
should not be fried until just before it goes to the table. 
It can be served with sourkroat or lettuce. 

35. Pike with Parmesan Cheese and Onions. A 

large fish is best adapted for this purpose. Scrape 
off the scales, remove the spine, cut into pieces about 
2 inches in size and sprinkle with salt. For about 5 
pounds of fish melt 2—3 tablespooufuls of butter in a 
saucepan, add a handful of finely chopped onions and 
in this stew the fish until done and take them out of 
the kettle, then rub a tablespoonful of flour in butter, 
add 1% pints of thick sour cream, constantly stirring; 
pour the sauce into a deep dish. Remove the bones out 
of the pieces of fish as carefully as possible, turn the 
latter in grated Parmesan cheese, put them in layers 
into the dish containing the sauce, and sprinkle with a 
handful of the cheese. The stewed pieces of fish, after 
having been turned in the cheese, can be covered with a 
sauce made of a cupful of sour cream, a cupful of meat 
broth and % teaspoonful of mushroom catsup, then 
sprinkle with capers and proceed as above directed. 



214 F.^-Fish ajnd Shell Fish. 

36. Pike with Egg Sauce. Put the tail of the fish 
into its mouth and set it on the fire with vinegar and 
water half and half in a medium-sized saucepan; there 
should not be too much broth, add some onions, 2 bay 
leaves, a few peppercorns, the half or the whole of a 
parsley root and the necessary salt. As soon as the 
fish is done place it carefully on a warm dish, and cover 
after pouring over it the following sauce: Rub 1 spoon- 
ful of flour in some hot butter, in the meantime stirring 
the yolks of 10 eggs in about 1 quart of bouillon (which 
can be made of extract of beef), add to the flour and 
bring to a boil under constaut stirring; then add prev- 
iously prepared mushrooms, crab tails, crab butter and 
lemon juice and serve the fish with the sauce over it. 

37. Baked Pike with Sour Cream. Cut the fish into 
pieces of proper size and put them into an earthenware 
baking pan. To 3 pounds offish add 2 bay leaves^ a 
few onion slices, salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 1 cup- 
ful of sour cream and then bake fn a hot oven for about 
20 minutes, basting the fish several times with this 
sauce and sprinkling it with grated crackers or Parme- 
san cheese. When serving stir through the sauce some 
bouillon, season with vinegar or lemon juice and pour 
it on the fish. Remove the bay leaves and onion slices 
before sending to the table. 

38. Baked Pike. After nicely cleaning the fish lard 
it on both sides, salt and bake it in butter, add finely 
sliced onions and when these are thoroughly heated 
pour in some water. After cooking for about 10 min- 
utes add a freshened thinly sliced herring, pounded 
crackers, some vinegar, ground pepper and nutmeg, 
and, if necessary, some more salt. The sauce must be 
well bound. 

39. Fricassee of Pike. Put a good-sized piece of 
butter into an earthenware dish with the fish nicely 
cleaned and cut into pieces ; add white wine, a few lemon 
slices without the seeds,- finely chopped anchovy and 
salt, dredge with finely grated crackers or grated wheat 
bread, and cover. After stewing the fish for about 
15 minutes until done, stir a few tablespoonfuls of thick 
sour cream through the sauce, pour it over the fish and 



Fresh Water Fpsh. 215 

serve. Put a border of ragout rice (see Division L) 
around the fricassee. 

40. Pike Steaks with Savory Herbs. Divide a me- 
dium-sized, cleaned and emptied pike in two lengthwise, 
remove the bones and skin from each part, cut into 
pieces about 2 inches in size, salt, sprinkle with pepper 
and stew in plenty of melted butter with several spoon- 
fuls of minced savory herbs for about 20 minutes in a 
medium hot oven until done. Send the steaks to the 
table arranged neatly around the sides of a dish of 
green peas, or a brown sweetbread ragout, using the 
juices in the pan for a Bechamel- or Madeira sauce, 
taking the first when the dish is served with green peas 
or the latter when served with the ragout. For the 
family table the steaks may be arranged in a spiral 

• form, then pour over them the greater part of the but- 
ter in which they were fried, put a border of mashed 
potatoes around the dish and serve with lettuce or a 
vegetable salad. 

41. Pike Salad. (See Division Q.) 

42. Eel Pout or Burbot. Empty the fish, leaving 
the liver but removing the gall bag, rinse thoroughly 
and then boil them for 15 minutes in water, salt and 
vinegar, let them lay in this broth for a little while 
and send to the table hot with a sour egg sauce or a 
tomato-, crab-, or fresh herb sauce (see Division K), 
together with boiled potatoes. Serve cold with vinegar, 
olive oil and pepper. The liver of the burbot is consid- 
ered a delicacy; it is boiled with the fish a few minutes 
before the latter is served. But little salt is required, 
the same as with eels. 

43. Fried Burbot. Burbot and other fresh water 
fish should be fried generally in the same manner as 
carp or pike; it will be well, however, to pickle them an 
hour beforehandTn olive oil and lemon juice with pars- 
ley and sliced onions. A fitting accompaniment to 
sourkrout and salads. 



216 F — Fish and Shell Fish. 

II. SALT WATER FISH. 

44. Boiled Sturgeon. After the fish is emptied wrap 
it into a cloth and let it lay on a stone slab in the cellar 
for 1 — 2 days, because its meat is tough when cooked 
fresh. Before boiling, rub it thoroughly with salt and 
water to remove all slime, then cut it into 5 — 10 pieces 
according to its size. Put it on the fire in cold water 
containing a handful of nettles, which assist in making 
the fish tender and in extracting the oil; let it draw 
slowly for % hour and take off the scum carefully. Then 
put the fish into fresh boiling water, add 6 — 10 onions, 
a few bay leaves, some cloves, peppercorns, a bunch 
of thyme, sage and majoram, and cook very slowly 
for another hour, taking off all of the fat with great 
care. Salt must not be added until the fish is quite 
tender, and then leave it in the broth a little while 
longer so that the salt may be absorbed. Take the fish 
out of the broth, remove all projecting gristle, cut into 
smaller pieces and send to the table with butter and a 
good mustard- or a parsley sauce (see Division R). 

The left-over pieces can be preserved for several days 
in the fish broth after adding a little vinegar; serve 
with olive oil, vinegar, pepper, finely chopped onions 
and mustard. 

45. Sturgeon Steaks. Take the left-over pieces out 
of the broth, cut them into slices about the thickness of 
a finger, dip them into eggs, pepper and minced escha- 
lots, turn in cracker crumbs and fry on both sides in 
hot butter over a quick fire to a light brown. Send to 
the table with young carrots or with onions browned in 
butter. 

46. Sturgeon a la Epicure. Cut a piece of sturgeon 
weighing about 4% pounds into slices and lard them. 
Line the bottom of a large saucepan with fresh bacon, 
ham, onions, carrots and parsley roots, all sliced; on 
these lay the fish slices, sprinkle with salt, pour over 
them a veal bouillon and then add 1% tablespoonfuls 
of butter, 1 bay leaf and a few peppercorns, cover the 
saucepan with a lid holding live embers, and let the 
fish simmer on a slow fire for a good half hour. Whet, 
done strain the broth, thicken with flour rubbed in 



Salt Water Fish. 217 

butter, add 1 glassful of white wine, and then pour 
the sauce so made over the fish slices which have been 
neatly arranged in the dish. 

47. Boiled Cod Fish. If the fish is to be cooked 
on a Friday it should be put into water for freshening 
not later than the Tuesday forenoon preceding. Before 
putting it into the vessel for freshening, cover the fish 
for half an hour with water and then pound it with 
a wooden mallet, gently at first and with gradually 
increasing force and long enough until the meat has 
lost its firmness; it should not, however, be pounded 
into shreds; then divide it into pieces of uniform size. 
To soften the meat use either potash or soda; the lat- 
ter is preferable because it is not so liable to leave an 
unpleasant taste. About 1 ounce of pulverized soda to 
each pound of fish is the proper proportion. Put the 
fish into a stone jar in layers sprinkled with the soda, 
cover with plenty of water and let it stand in a very 
cool place until the following Thursday morning, that 
is to say, for two days and two nights ; then press the 
fish until dry, scrape off the scales and otherwise clean 
very nicely, cut off the fins, rinse and lay into fresh 
water. The water should be changed at least three 
times and the pieces pressed dry each time. 

When preparing the fish lay the pieces on top of 
each other on a cloth ; three hours before they are to be 
used put them on the fire in a kettle with cold water 
with a plate in the bottom of the kettle. Wrapping the 
pieces in the cloth keeps them in better shape. Heat 
the cod fish slowly and then let it draw, but it should 
never boil even in the slightest degree. When serving 
put the drained fish on -a hot 'platter, sprinkle with fine 
salt, cover and send to the table with potatoes. About 
%— % ounce of salt is the right proportion for dried cod 
fish. If the fish is to be salted in the water add the 
required quantity of salt about 15 minutes before serv- 
ing, after taking out part of the fish broth. Most 
people prefer as a sauce simply plenty of good butter 
and mustard . Another sauce is made by boiling water, 
milk and fish broth, bind with cornstarch and then stir 
through it butter and mustard ; do not cook the latter. 

Remark.— If more cod fish has been prepared than is consumed during the 
meal, what is left over can be warmed with butter over boiling water, or a pie can 
be made from it as directed in E, 21. 



218 F.— Fish and Shell, Fish. 

48. Fresh Cod Fish. Scrape and empty the fish, 
cut off -the fins, remove the head and tail and divide the 
body into pieces 1 — 2 inches in width. The head, which 
many consider a delicacy, is divided in two if not too 
large, and scalded in sharply salted water for, about 
5 minutes beforehand, afterwards add the remaining 
pieces and boil for 10 — 15 minutes longer, carefully tak- 
ing off all the scum. As soon as the fish is done put it 
on a warm dish, garnish with parsley and add butter, 
mustard and boiled potatoes; other kinds of sauces are 
appropriate, for instance parsley-, sorrel-, or an oyster 
sauce. For large parties the fish is served with another 
sauce besides melted butter. If it is to be sent to the 
table whole, whereby it remains much juicier, cook it on 
a quick fire in salted water. The liver cannot be used 
on account of its pungent flavor. Cod fish and all other 
salt fish are the nicest when boiled in milk and water 
half and half; they thereby receive a milder flavor and 
the meat becomes flakey. 

In England cod fish is most generally served with 
the following sauce. Grate 8 hard-boiled eggs, mix with 
it 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of 
mustard, a little mace, salt and lemon juice, add a few 
spoonfuls of fish broth and % pound of fresh butter and 
stir the sauce on the stove until boiling hot. 

A Hollandaise-, o.yster- and Bechamel- or crab sauce 
can also be served with the cod fish. 

49. Stewed Fresh Cod Fish. Cut off the head and 
tail, wash, salt and lay them into an earthenware vessel, 
add plenty of butter, rolled crackers, nutmeg or mace, 
a sliced lemon without the seeds, a large cupful of wine, 
cover and stew on a slow fire until tender. The Ibody 
of the fish is cooked in the same way. 

50. Fresh Cod Fish Roulades. Take a number of 
small fresh cod fish after they are cleaned and emptied, 
divide in two lengthwise, remove the skin and take out 
the bones, and then cut each half into 2 or 3 pieces, 
according to the size of the fish. Make a forcemeat of 
the scraps of the fish with the addition of savory herbs, 
sour cream, eggs, salt, pepper and grated. bread, spread 
the forcemeat on the pieces of fish, roll them up and 
wrap in buttered paper, put them into a buttered pan 



Salt Water Fish. 219 

with white wine, bouillon, savory herbs and bake slowly 
for % hour. Then take off the paper, spread the rolls 
with a thick Remoulade sauce, sprinkle with grated 
bread, dot with crab butter and bake for a little while. 
Slice the rolls and serve with salsify. 

51. Boiled Haddock. Scale, empty and wash the 
haddock and divide according to size into 3 — 4 pieces 
and after rinsing these once again, put'them into boil- 
ing, rather strongly salted water, and take off the scum. 
After the fish has boiled for a few minutes leave it in - 
the broth for a while louger to absorb some of the salt 
and send to the table hot. 

Before transporting haddock they are frequently 
emptied and salted. In this case put them on the fire 
in cold water and exercise careful judgment in the appli- 
cation of salt. . Serve with hot boiled potatoes, melted 
butter and mustard, or else with a mustard sauce. 

52. Haddock with Savory Herbs. After cleaning 
the fish divide it into pieces and remove skin and bones 
carefully. Pickle these pieces for an hour in a glassful 
of white wine, the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper and 
minced herbs, then stew a dozen chopped mushrooms 
in butter with a handful of minced herbs and a few sliced 
eschalots. Simmer the fish in this for 10 minutes, add 
to it % of the marinade with a little more white wine, 
and stew the fish for 5 minutes longer. Strain the fish 
broth and stir through it flour rubbed in butter and 
extract of beef bouillon to a rather thick sauce, which 
is served with the fish. 

53. Stuffed Haddock. Take 2 fish of medium size 
and after they are cleaned wash them, dry and fill with 
veal forcemeat A, No. 24, sew them, sprinkle with salt 
and brush all over with anchovy butter. Then lay 
them in a well buttered pan, bake in the oven for % hour 
to a light brown color, and in the meantime prepare the 
sauce as follows: Finely chop a few gherkins, eschalots 
and capers and rub with a tablespoonful of flour in 
brown butter and then boil with 2 cupfuls of hot bou- 
illon. Strain the sauce and season, if necessary, with a 
little lemon juice and with pepper, salt- and a spoonful of 
chopped parsley. Put the fish on a hot platter, garnish 
with sprigs of parsley and serve with the sauce. 



220 F.— Fish and Shell, Fish. 

54. Haddock in Hamburg Style. Take off the head 
and cut into slices about % of an inch thick, salt and set 
aside for an hour, butter a pan and put in the pieces of 
the fish together with sliced raw potatoes alternately, 
sprinkle each layer with chopped onions heated in but- 
ter and with some pepper,, and pour over all a large 
cupful of sour cream whipped with 3 eggs. Bake in the 
oven for a good half hour and send to the table with 
lettuce or a bean salad. 

55. Boiled Turbot. In Germany turbot are consid- 
ered the finest of all fishes and many esteem the head 
and tail as being particular delicacies. After rubbing 
the fish with salt and emptying, being careful to remove 
the gall bag from the liver, wash the fish with salted 
water, trim the fins, cut off the tail fully a hand's length 
and also the head with at least % inch of the flesh with 
it. Then divide the middle piece smoothly intwo length- 
wise, and cut the two halves into pieces of proper size. 
Cqok in strongly salted water for about 10 minutes, 
skimming carefully; the fish is done when the fins can 
be easily pulled out. If the fish is to be boiled whole 
put it into a fish kettle, or when this is lacking wrap.it 
in a napkin and put it on the fire in salted water with a 
plate in the bottom of the kettle. As soon as done 
drain and put the fish with the white side to the top on 
a warm dish and garnish with parsley. When sorrel is 
in season and quite young make a good sorrel sauce, at 
any other time a crab-, shrimp- or butter sauce, and 
particularly a Bearnese sauce, (see Division R). Nice 
boiled potatoes with melted butter, lemon juice and 
mustard are also very good. 

56. Baked Turbot. The turbot is prepared the same 
as in the above receipt, divided into pieces, salted and 
baked the same as codfish. The same sauces are used 
as given for cooked turbot. 

57. Crusted Turbot. Use for this purpose remnants 
Of the fish. Remove all skin and bones and cut the 
meat into small pieces; stew, them for a few moments 
with butter and chopped eschalots, mushrooms and 
parsley, add salt and pepper and put into a baking pan 
with the pieces heaping towards the middle, pour over 
it a few tablespoonfuls of white sauce, sprinkle the sur- 



Salt Water Fish. '221 

face with bread crumbs and dot with butter. When this 
gratin is of a nice brown color send to the table at once 
with a dish of creamy mashed potatoes into. which the 
yolks of a few eggs have been stirred. 

58. Boiled Soles. Soles have a white and a gray 
side, the first is scraped, and skinned from the tail up- 
wards. Cut off the head, the point of the tail and the 
fins, empty the fish, wash several times with cold water 
and let it lay for an hour in salted water. Then cook 
in boiling salted water with onions and coarse spices 
for a few minutes until done. Garnish the dish with 
sprigs of parsley, sliced lemons and. serve with boiled 
potatoes and a crab- or butter sauce (see Division R), 
with mustard according to taste. 

59. Fried Soles. After the fish is cleaned, sprinkle 
with salt, let it stand for an hour or two, dry with a 
cloth, cut slits into the skin over the entire fish, brush 
with a beaten egg mixed with a little water, dredge with 
rolled crackers and fry on both sides in hot butter or 
lard in an open pan on a quick fire, to a crisp and light 
brown color. 

60. Fried Soles, Bremen Style. After the fish have 
been cleaned they should be cut into several pieces if 
they are large, otherwise leave them whole, salt and let 
them stand for an hour. Then dry them, turn in melted 
butter first and then in egg and bread crumbs and fry. 
In the meantime stir 6tabfespoonfuls of creamed butter 
with 2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy butter, the juice of 
2 lemons, salt, nutmeg, 1 tablespoonful of mustard and 
1 tablespoonful of minced parsley to a cream. Put the 
fish into the pan in layers, and the cream between them, 
and serve with boiled potatoes and a dish of potato 
salad. 

61. Fillets of Soles. The fillets are cut the same as 
pike, salted an d laid in lemon juice for 1 hnn r. -Make a 
forceriTeat of remnants ol poultry, crab butter, eggs, 
salt, pepper and grated wheat bread and spread over 
the fillets. Melt some fresh butterylay the fillets in this 
with sliced truffles and over these some pork fat and 
then a buttered paper, and bake in the oven for 15 min- 
utes. In the meantime stew young mushrooms in but- 
ter, bouillon and lemon juice until done, fill into the 



222 F.— Fish and Shell, Fish. 

middle of the dish and surround them with the fillets 
which have been taken out of the paper and pork fat. 

62. Baked Fillets of Soles with Sauce. When baking 
or making a fricassee of the soles it is better to skin the 
fish on both sides. This is easily done by loosening the 
skin atthe end of the tail and rapidly pulling it off. Cut 
the sole into 4 pieces, take the flesh from the bones, 
pickle these 4 fillets in lemon juice, salt and parsley 
leaves. Shortly before serving take them out of the 
pickle, dip in egg and nutmeg, sprinkle with cracker 
crumbs and fry in browned butter, basting often, until 
crisp and of a dark yellow color. Garnish the same as 
given for boiled soles and serve with a Remoulade-, 
anchovy-, caper- or crab sauce, (see Division R), or serve 
as is usually done in Holland, with good fresh lettuce. 
Potato salad is often served with it in Bremen. 

63. Baked Soles with Lemon Juice. The soles are 
prepared as directed in the above receipt and laid for 
1—2 hours in lemon juice, salt, chopped eschalots and 
spices. Before baking dry the fillet, turn in flour and 
then in egg and bread crumbs and bake in plenty of 
lard to a light brown color. The soles are sent to the 
table hot on a napkin and -garnished with a bunch of 
parsley. Serve with a highly spiced sauce, or as a side 
dish Avith young peas, asparagus, etc. 

The fish can also be fried in butter and served with 
a flue ragout of oysters, crabs, and the like. 

64. Boiled flackerel. The mackerel is a nice, fat 
fish. Cut off the head and lay it in strongly salted 
w ater w ith ajittle vin egar for a n hour , 'in 'one large or" 
^number of smalTer pieces?'"' If i"FTs""l3&iled whole, lay it 
on a plate and pour not vinegar over it. In the mean- 
time, cook some onions, tarragon, thyme, sweet basil, 
pepper and cloves in salted water, put the mackerel into 
a fish kettle and cook for a few minutes, skim, add' 
some vinegar and serve with a Travemunder sauce, 
(see Bivision R) . 

The mackerel is also fried and left in a' pickle: of 
I mon juice and salt for a little while like other fish. . 

65. Boiled Smelts. Wash and clean the fish thor- 
oughly and boil in salted water for a few minutes, skim- 



Salt Water Fish. 223 

ming carefully. Then pour into it a little cold water ; 
serve the fish with hot potatoes, butter and mustard 
and a sour egg sauce, (see Division R). 

66. Baked Smelts are prepared the same as boiled 
smelts, nicely washed, put on a colander and sprinkled 
with fine salt, turned in flour and fried crisp in plenty of 
hot fat to a light yellow color. Potato salad is served 
with it. 

Remark. — The smelt is a dry fish, and plenty of fat must be used in frying. 

67. Fish Rice. % pound of rice is cooked in salted 
water with a little butter or in bouillon until thick and 
done, boil 3 — 4 eggs until hard, cut the whites into 
small pieces and grate the yolks. In the meantime 
bone about % pound of fish, taking out all the skin, and 
break the meat into pieces. Then mix the rice with 
the fish and the whites of the eggs, stir over the fire 
until hot with 2 spoonfuls of melted butter, a little 
salt, cayenne pepper and nutmeg, put the fish rice on a 
hot dish and sprinkle over it the grated yolks of the 
eggs. Using half cream and half crab butter mixed with 
stewed mushrooms and the whole stirred with a few 
whipped eggs, will make the dish much nicer. 

68. Caviar Sandwiches. Butter wheat bread toast, 
spread thickly with caviar and serve with lemon slices 
and finely chopped onions. 

69. Anchovy Sandwiches. Either toast wheat bread 
slices or brown them in butter, or else soak the bread in 
milk and egg and rapidly brown it in melted butter. 
Then spread the bread with a sauce as described further 
on and cover with anchovies prepared as directed under 
A, No. 31. Line the inside of a dish with these bread 
slices in such a manner that they overlap shingle-fash- 
ion. Put hard boiled eggs divided into halves into the 
middle of the dish with the square edges to the top and 
pour over them the following herb sauce: Grate the 
yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs and gradually stir with 
them minced herbs such as estragon, parsley and bur- 
net, also a email cupful of bouillon, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
olive oil, 1—2 tablespoonfuls ©f wine vinegar, capers, 
mustard and some pepper.

70. Fried Fresh Herring. After the fish are cleaned 
and emptied, wash, salt and dry them. Then pickle for 
an hour in lemon juice, a little salt and pepper/, turn in 
egg and then in cracker crumbs and mace. Fry in hot 
butter. Herring can be filled and fried and are then 
very delicious. Melt 3 heaping tables poonfulfe of butter, 
stir in as much rye bread as will absorb the butter, add 
2 eggs, 2 chopped eschalots, salt and pepper and fill 
into the fish. 

71 . Boiled Fre"sh Herring. After the fish have been 
cleaned and washed, sprinkle with salt, dip into vine- 
gar, turn the tail of the fish into its mouth and then 
cook in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes. 
Garnish the dish with sprigs of parsley or grated horse- 
radish and serve with a parsley or butter sauce. 

72. Fried Salt Herring in Mecklenburg Style. Re- 
move fins, bones, roes or milt, and put the herring into 
milk to freshen. Then dry them, turn in a sauce made 
of wine, the yolks of a few eggs and flour and fry in hot 
butter. Serve with sourkrout. 

73. Pickled Herring. After cleaning the herring 
take out the milt without opening the body. Wash 
carefully and lay them preferably into milk, or else into 
water, for two days to freshen them. Then for 12 her- 
rings take 1 nutmeg, 1 ounce of white mustard seeds, 8 
eschalots, and 12 white peppercorns, .pound finely and 
put part of the mixture into each herring. Put the fish 
into a jar in layers with small onions, peppergrass, tar- 
ragon, thyme, bay leaves; stir up the milt with vinegar 
and pour into, the jar. 

Herring can be pickled in a simpler way by omitting 
filling them with the above mixture, or else the vinegar 
may be stirred to a thick sauce with the strained milt ; 
the sauce is then poured over the fish. Before pickling, 
herring are frequently cut into thin slices. 

74. Broiled Herring. After the fish has been fresh- 
ened and dried, trim the head a little smaller on both 
sides, take out the eyes, and brown on a broiler, then 
lay them into a dish with lemon slices, bay leaves, 
coarse ground pepper and cloves and pour over them 
some beer, vinegar and salad oil. 

They are served for breakfast, also with pea soup. 



Salt "Water Fish. 225 

75. Herring for Tea. About 1% cupfuls of sour 
cream are well beaten, add 3 teaspoonfuls of mustard, 
2 tablespoonfuls of olive oil, the same quantity of vine- 
gar, % of a grated onion and a little pepper, and stir 
well together. To the above quantity take 6 freshened 
boned herrings, cut into long pieces and mix with the 
sauce. Serve with bread and butter for tea. 

76. Herring with Remoulade Sauce. After the her- 
ring have been freshened and skinned tear into halves 
down the middle, bone, cut into pieces and pour over 
them a good Remoulade sauce. Serve for breakfast or 
supper. 

77. Herring Cream. Freshen G herring for 24 hours 
and then cut them into pieces. Lay the pieces into a 
dish, take 1 cupful of not too strong vinegar, and beat 
into this the yolks of 6 eggs, % pound of butter, 2 large 
grated onions, 1 heaping teaspoonful of mustard and 
1 tablespoonful of sugar, stir on the fire to a cream, 
let it cool and pour over the herring pieces. Garnish 
with hard boiled eggs, mushrooms, gherkins or button 
onions. 

78. Herring Rolls. The herring are freshened, split 
down" the back and divided into two pieces. After they 
are carefully boned, spread the inner side with mustard 
and grated onions, then with capers, roll tight, tie with 
a white thread (which is taken off when the fish is sent 
to the table), and serve with a sauce as directed for 
pickled herring. A very nice and quickly made dish to 
serve with cold meat. 

79. Broiled Bloaters. If they are to be cooked on a 
broiler, split them down the back, empty, but leave in 
the milt, put a piece of butter on the fish, clap them 
together, wrap into buttered paper and cook until done. 
If you have no broiler, open the body of the bloaters 
instead of the back and after they have been emptied 
fry them nicely in butter. 

80. Boiled Lobster. The lobster is killed by putting 
it head first into seething hot water with plenty of salt. 
Carraway seed is often put into the water, also a bunch 
of parsley. The water must be kept boiling during the 
entire time the lobster is cooking. The lobster should 



226 F. — Fish and Shell Fish. 

boil according to size from 10—15 minutes, if very large 
15 — 20 minutes; leave it iu the water 15 minutes longer 
to cool, and after taking it out brush with a piece of 
pork fat or good olive oil, which will give it a 7 bright 
appearance. Before serving, split it-lengthwise into two 
pieces and cut it crosswise into smaller pieces, #reak the 
claws so that the meat can be easily taken out, put the 
pieces together so that it will have its original form, 
and garnish, with parsley leaves. 

Serve the lobster warm with butter, chopped parsley 
and a lemon cut into 8 pieces. When the lobster is 
brought to the table cold, serve it with olive oil, wine 
vinegar and parsley. 

81. American Lobster. After the lobster is cooked 
as given under No. 80, take off the meat, cut the -meat 
from the tail into slices and the meat from, the claws 
into .small pieces, and stew both for % hour in a sauce 
made as follows : Stew a few eschalots in butter, add 1 
cupful of white wine, take 6 tomatoes, stew and then 
pass them through a sieve and then stir through it 1 
cupful of brown sauce. Season the sauce with cayenne 
pepper, stew the meat and fill the dish in such a manner 
that the larger pieces of the lobster form a border 
around the smaller pieces heaped in -the center. c A 
border of rice around the whole is very delicious. 

, 82. Lobster Fricassee with Fish Balis and Asparagus. 

Take fat young spring chickens, clean and boil them in 
not too much salted water with a piece of butter arid 
mace, skimming carefully. About \ hour before they 
are done add some cleaned and parboiled asparagus. 
When the chickens are done, cut all the meatinto cubes, 
pour the broth with a little fat over this, put in the 
asparagus, cover, and set aside in a warm place. In 
the remaining broth cook some fish dumplings (see 
Division O) which are put with the asparagus. Then 
stir as much flour and butter as is needed to a fricassee 
sauce, let it cook, and pour the chicken broth to it; 
cook for % hour and strain through a fine sieve. This 
sauce is put into a rinsed dish with the meat of the 
chicken, asparagus anddumplings and cooked for afew 
minutes, add the lobster pieces, which must not boil 
again, take the dish from the stove, stir the sauce with 



Salt Water Fish. 227 

1 — 2 yolks of eggs, put the fricassee into a hot dish and 
serve with croutons. 

83. Lobster Salad with Caviar Sandwiches. This 
receipt will be found under Salads, (see Division Q). 

84. Crabs. The crabs are put into cold water and 
cleaned with a whisk broom. In the meantime heat a 
piece of butter in a kettle^pour in a little vinegar,~add a 
bunch of parsley, pepper and salt, and when the water 
boils put in the crabs and stir them a few times. After 
about 10 — 15 minutes they will receive a red color, take 
from the fire, put them on a napkin, pile in pyramid 
form and garnish with parsley. 

85. Fried Oysters. Sprinkle a f ew drops of lemon 
Juice on thn oysters, add a very little mace, turn in egg 

and mace, then in grated crackers and try in a pan in 
hot butter; frying the oysters too long makes them 
hard. They can also be baked in butter for a few 
moments. 

Another way is to dry the oysters with a cloth and 
sprinkle with wheat flour. Then fry 2 small onions in 
butter until light brown, fry the oysters in this for a 
few seconds, sprinkle with salt and pepper and drop 
over them a few drops of lemon juice. 

86. Oyster Stew. Open a few dozen oysters, cut off 
the beards, sprinkle with lemon juice, put the beards of 
the oysters together with the liquor and pepper, mace 
and lemon peel into a stew pan, let it boil for half an 
hour, thicken the broth with flour lightly browned, add 
1 cupful of thick sweet cream and stir the broth until 
thick. Heat the oysters in this and serve immediately. 

87. Fish Pudding. See Puddings, No. 41. 

. Boiled trout, pike-perch, pike and oysters are the 
only kinds of fish that should be served to invalids. 
With these fish serve only a butter sauce, which is 
stirred with a few yolks of eggs and seasoned with a 
little lemon juice, or fresh butter stirred to a cream; a 
Bechamel- or Hollandaise sauce can also be served. 



Q. — Rare Dishes of Various 
Kinds. 



1. Turtle Soup. Medium-sized turtles are better 
than the very large ones, because the meat of the latter 
is usually tough. The day before the turtle is cooked, 
hang it up by the hind legs and as soon as it puts out 
its head, cut it off; then let it bleed for about 4 hours, 
lay on a meat board, cut the under side all around 
from the shell and empty carefully, cut away the gall 
bag which is attached to the liver. The liver and heart, 
also the eggs if there are any, are laid in fresh water. 
After the turtle is emptied cut the forefeet with quite a 
piece of the flesh from each side, and smaller pieces from 
the hind feet. -The fins are cut off and the feet and the 
under side scalded in boiling water, so that the skin can 
he taken off. It is not advisable to cook the turtle 
whole, as it is very slimy and has quite a strong flavor. 

Wash the meat carefully, lay for a few hours in cold 
water, changing the water frequently, and then hang 
up the meat over night to let it air. The next day put 
the heart and meat with some thin beef bouillon on 
the stove to cook, (the bouillon can be made the day 
before), with the necessary salt, skim carefully and put 
into the broth a bunch of tarragon and thyme, finely 
chopped onions and a bottle of white wine, and let the 
meat cook in this until done. Then take the meat out 
of the broth, and after it is cold cut it into long, neat 
pieces. The liver is not cooked with it, but is stewed in 
butter until tender, then cut into pieces and laid i"to 
the tureen. 



G. — Rare Dishes of Various Kinds. 229 

The turtle soup is served clear, also thickened ; the 
latter kind is preferred. When it is to be thickened, 
brown some flour in butter, stir with it some of the 
broth and put into the soup. The turtle meat is cooked 
in the soup for % hour and seasoned with powdered 
ginger, cayenne pepper, cloves and mace; dumplings 
may also be added and are made of sqme of the raw 
turtle meat as follows : Chop the turtle meat with some 
beef marrow, pound it in a mortar, and then mix with 
some bread, eggs, salt, mace, grated lemon peel and 
white pepper and make small dumplings. Instead of 
these, veal dumplings can also be used. As dumplings 
when cooked in a thickened soup make the latter too 
thick, it is well to cook the dumplings in the soup before 
the browned flour is put in, and when the dumplings 
are done put them into a tureen with some of the bou- 
illon while thickening the soup. 

If it is desired to put turtle sausages into the soup, 
take the same forcemeat described as above for the 
dumplings. Mix with it a small glassful of brandy, 
some finely chopped eschalots rubbed in plenty of beef 
marrow, a little white pepper and some minced liver 
and fill this into very small sausage casings, boil the 
sausages until done, cut the'm into oblique pieces and 

Eut them into the tureen when the soup is served, 
hould there be any eggs in the turtle put them into 
the soup together with a bottle of Madeira. Serve the 
soup very hot over the liver and dumplings. 

A medium-sized turtle will take about 1^—2 hours 
in cooking, and an old one from 3 — 3% hours. 

2. Soup made of Canned Turtle. In cooking the 
soup the green fat, which has an oily flavor, should be 
removed as much as possible by means of hot water. 
Then cut the meat into small cubes, bring to a boil once 
in a strong Espagnole sauce with Madeira, and serve. 

The Espagnole sauce is made as follows : Line the 
bottom of a deep saucepan with fresh butter about % of 
an inch thick, put in a pound of sliced, lean, raw ham, 
then 3—4 large sliced Spanish onions, 1 pound of lean 
veal, 2 old partridges or 2 old pigeons, an old chicken 
and the remnants of uncooked or roasted poultry, pour 
in 2 bastingspoonfuls of bouillon and put the pan on a 
slow Are, allowing the whole to simmer slowly and to 



230 G— Rare Dishes of Various Kinds. 

draw until it is of a light brown, being very careful not 
to scorch. Then fill up with the bouillon, bring to a 
boil, skim off the fat very thoroughly, put in some 
carrots, green leek, parsnips and cook slowly. In the 
meantime lightly brown some flour in % pound of fresh 
butter for 1 hour over a slow fire, stir with bouillon 
until thin and smooth and cook- for 2 hours slowly and 
uninterruptedly, taking off "all the fat and scum fre- 
quently and carefully; then pass the broth through a 
fine sieve, add % bottle of Madeira and then cook until 
rather thick, constantly stirring, adding at the last the 
juice of a lemon. 

3. Snail Soup. The vineyard and the spiral species 
are the only kinds that can be used for this soup, and 
then only when they are closed. Boil for an hour in 
boiling salted water, pull them out of their shells with a 
fork, take off the little patch of skin from the top, cut 
away the ring which encircles the snail and remove the 
front point. Sprinkle with a handful of salt which will 
loosen the slime, Avash them 3 or 4 times in warmed 
water and press them dry. Boil about 50 snails in 
bouillon, take them out of the kettle, chop 2 — 3 of them 
very finely, stew in butter for a short time, add as much 
bouillon as is required to make the soup, put in a little 
mace and boil for a few minutes, stir in the yolks of a 
few eggs and serve the soup with wheat bread toast and 
the rest of the snails in the tureen. 

If the soup is cooked during Lent, boil all of the 
snails in water until tender, chop all of them finely with 
4 hard boiled eggs, 2 onions, minced parsley and a few 
rolls soaked in milk, stew this in butter for 15 minutes. 
Then pour in part of the snail broth, % bottle of light 
wine and a pint of pea broth, season with salt and 
pepper and stir through the soup the yolks of a few 
eggs. 

4. Snails in Sauce. Take a few washed and boned 
anchovies, and chop fine with a little parsley. Then 
knead a tablespoonful of stale grated wheat bread," a 
little flour and 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, mix 
the chopped anchovy and parsley with this, stir with 
good bouillon, lay the snails into this with a little mace 
and pepper and cook for % hour. A very nice dish is 
made by serving the snails in their shells, which should 



G. — Rare Dishes op Various Kinds. 231 

be nicely cleaned and dried. Then take anchovies, pars- 
ley, the spices already mentioned, butter, wheat bread, 
flour, knead all together, fill some of it iuto a shell, lay 
a snail on this and cover with some of the mixture. 
After the shells have all been filled in this manner, put 
them into a saucepan with th"e openings to the top, add 
a bastiugspoonful of bouillon and serve after cooking 
for ]i hour. 

5. .Snail Salad. The snails are cleaned as directed 
in No. 4 and cut lengthwise into pieces, or else leave 
them whole and mix with salt, pepper, finely chopped 
onions ancTtwo parts of olive oil to one part of vinegai 

6. Ragout of Frog Legs. Put the frog legs into a 
deep dish with water, vinegar and salt and wash thor- 
oughly with a whisk. Then melt some butter, lay the 
frog legs with a few eschalots and a little salt into this, 
cover and simmer until" nearly done. Then sprinkle 
over it some flour, add some strong bouillon, made of 
extract of beef, mace and a few lemon slices, cook the 
frog legs until done and stir the sauce with a few yolks 
of eggs. Wheat bread or meat dumplings cooked in 
either salted water or bouillon can also be laid around 
the ragout. 

7. Frog Leg Pie. Make a ragout as directed in 
No. 6, with good meat dumplings and fill into the pie. 

8. Ptarmigan or White Grouse is cooked the same 
as prairie chicken, but the entire skin must be pulled off 
with the feathers. 

9. Coot. The skin of the ' coot has an oily taste 
and must be taken off; then tie. pork fat slices around 
the bird and roast it like wild duck. 

10. Guinea Fowl are only fit for use when quite 
young; roast like prairie chicken. 

11. Roast Peacock. A Suabian Receipt. The half- 
grown peacock is the best for a roast. It is killed 
about three days before wanted for use, plucked up to 
half of the neck, the head taken off, emptied and washed 
clean. Rub inside and out with salt and pepper, fill 
into it a bay leaf, some parsley and some sweet basil, 



282 G.— Rare Dishes of Yarjous Kind's. 

lay some pork fat on the breast, or lard the breast and 
legs with fine pork fat lafdoons and roast slowly. If it 
is to be roasted on a spit, tie over the breast some 
buttered paper. When serving, lay the head with the 
peacock, garnish the dish with water cresses and serve 
with an oyster- or brown sauce; season with lemon 
slices. 

If liked a well-seasoned veal forcemeat may be filled 
into the peacock. 

13. Suabian Peacock Pie. Kill a young half-grown 
peacock a few days before it is to be used ; cut off the 
head, pluck, empty, wash very thoroughly, rub inside 
and out with spices and salt. Put a piece of butter into 
a saucepan, let the meat simmer in this for a little 
while, mince the liver with a small piece of pork fat and 
an onion, brown a handful of bread crumbs in butter, 
simmer the mince in this, pour the butter out of the 
pan and substitute for it the minced liver, etc., together 
with % bottle of wine; boil an ounce of truffles in wine 
and put them in with the wine, a large spoonful of 
bouillon, a few lemon slices, a little sweet basil and a 
few bay leaves, cover the pan tightly and when the 
peacock has been cooked slowly until nearly done, let it 
cool in this sauce. Make a good butter crust, put in 
the bird with a piece of pork fat on its breast, close and 
brash the crust as usual and bake in an oven for % of 
an hour tb a light brown. The remaining sAuce is 
thinned with bouillon and a little lemon juice and kept 
hot. When the pie is taken out of the oven remove the 
upper crust and pour in the sauce, then put the head of 
the peacock on the cover, close the pie and send it to 
the table hot. 

Old birds can be used for small pies only, for in- 
stance, pies of various kinds of meat (see E, No. 11) ; it 
may- be well to lay the meat into a seasoned broth 
some time beforehand. 

14. Mountain Cock or Grouse. For roasting, young 
birds only should be taken as the older ones are almost 
invariably tough and fit for ragouts or fricassees only. 
Fill with the following forcemeat: Chop a piece of good 
veal with some raw ham and its fat very finely, then 
add a few yolks of eggs with a couple of ground cloves, 



G.— Rare Dishes of Various Kinds. 238 

some thick sweet cream, grated wheat bread, salt and 
the frothed whites of the eggs, mix well, fill into the 
bird and roast like turkey. 

15. Mountain Cock Pies. Cut the bird into small 
pieces, take out all of the bones, slightly roast the meat 
in butter and let it lay in wine vinegar with pepper, 
nutmeg and button onions for a few hours. In the 
meantime finely chop equal parts of veal, beef and fresh 
pork, add the yolk of an egg and the chopped yolks of 
several hard boiled eggs, some wheat bread and nut- 
meg. Line the bottom of the pie mould with pork fat 
and butter, put on a layer of the meat, then a-layer of 
the chopped meat and so on until the mould is filled. 
Put a few lemon slices on top, sprinkle with salt and 
pour in % bottle of wine. Cover the mould tightly and 
cook on a slow fire for 4—5 hours. If the pie should 
become too dry, add a little more wine. After the pie is 
done, remove the lemon slices, bind the gravy with egg 
yolks and send the dish to the table cold. 

16. Roast Badger. A young badger is quite palat- 
able and tender, similar to pork tenderloin. Let it lay 
in vinegar for 2—3 days, with onions, carrots, sage and 
all kinds of kitchen herbs, bay leaves, pepper, cloves and 
salt ; lard- and roast it like young hare, but for a shorter 
length of time. 

17. Ragout of Badger. All of the meat which is not 
used for the roast is cut into pieces and prepared like 
ragout of hare ("Hasenpfeffer )., If there should not 
be enough of the meat some pork may be added. 

18. Bear's Paws. Bear's paws are by many con- 
sidered to be a great delicacy, in fact the best part of 
the bear. Clean the forepaws very nicely, boil in salted 
water until tender, dip them in melted butter, egg, and 
then in bread crumbs, broil with frequent basting until 
lightly brown. Garnish with lemon slices and capers 
and send to the table with any kind of a spicy gravy. 
Sometimes the paws are pickled in vinegar and savory 
herbs for a day beforehand ; then boil in bouillon and 
part of the marinade instead of water before broiliag 
them. 



234 G. — Rare Dishes of Vatuous Kinds. 

19. Roast Bear. The hindquarters and the saddle 
of a young bear are the best for roasting. Meat from 
an old bear should be pickled in vinegar for a few days 
and then laid in milk for' another day before roasting. 
Put the roast into the oven with a little water, add salt, 
baste freqently and roast for 3—4 hours. Take the fat 
from the gravy, stir into it a little sour cream, and 
serve with the roast. 

20. Roast Beaver Tails. The flesh of the beaver is 
usually braised, but the tail, which is considered a deli- 
cacy, is roasted after it has lain in a marinade for a 
day. Scrape it carefully, boil in vinegar, water and 
some salt until tender and then turn it in whipped egg 
yolks and rolled crackers. Pour melted butter over it, 
roast on a broiler and serve with sliced lemon's. 



H. — Hot Puddings. 



1 . How Puddings are cooked. The pudding mould 
should never be used until it has been tested by pouring 
water into it to see if it is perfectly tight. The slightest 
leak in the mould will inevitably spoil the pudding. 

Before using the mould rub it thoroughly on the 
inside with a dry cloth and carefully and plentifully 
hntter it. and afterwards dredge with rolled cracker or 
finely grated wheat bread . s *tf^e^nTouIJ^'as"iib'f T3eeii"' 
carefully buttered the pudding will adhere to it and 
tear or crumble in taking out. When through using, it 
is important to a t puce clea n the mould and keep it in 
^jyir^j^plaee. -• 

A trifle of salt should be put into all puddings, puffs 
and other sweet dishes, otherwise they will be apt to 
have an insipid taste. 

The pudding dough must be vigorously stirred and 
the whites of the eggs used should be beaten until stiff, 
if possible by an assistant, so that it will not be neces- 
sary to interrupt stirring the pudding. As soon as the 
froth has been slightly stirred through the pudding, it 
should be put into the mould immediately, setting it 
into boiling water, except in case of yeast puddings. 

When making yeast puddings the mould should be 
filled only about one-half and put on the fire in luke- 
warm water, at other times it is usual to fill the mould 
about three-fourths. Then cover tightly and close the 
edge with a thick paste of flour and water; put the 
• mould into boiling water, but not too deep,- in order 
that the water in "boiling may not penetrate through 
the edge of the cover and thus spoil the pudding. To 
prevent the mould from lifting in the kettle, which some- 
times occurs, secure it by putting some weights on it or 



236 H.— Hot Puddings. 

tying it to the cover with a string. A false bottom in 
the kettle, either a piece of slate, an old plate, etc., 
will be advantageous and if through neglect the water 
should boil away, the- pudding will not then scorch. 
Puddings should cook continuously and uniformly, 
replenishing the boiling water whenever necessary, and 
also beiug cautious not to jar the mould, which is apt 
to make the pudding fall. 

When cooking puddings in a cloth the latter should 
be rinsed in hot water, then wring dry, brush with 
butter and dredge with flour as far as the pudding will 
cover the cloth. As soon as the pudding is filled into 
the cloth tie it tightly with a string, leaVing enough 
loose cloth for expansion; the water should boil vigor- 
ously and uninterruptedly", otherwise the pudding will 
become heavy and spoil. A mould is always preferable. 

Puddings should always be served in a hot dish 
during the cold season, or M the kitchen happens to be 
at some distance from the dining room, take the pud- 
ding out of the mould just before it is set on the table. 

All puddings will be best when cooked in a double 
kettle. 

2. English Plum Pudding, No. 1. For 12— 14 per- 
sons use 4 eggs, (the whites beaten to a froth), about 
1 pint of sweet cream, % pound of fine flour, % pound of 
kidney suet, % pound of nicely washed currants, % pound

1. Form of the flould, etc. The mould for souffles 
should be treated the same as the pudding form, but- 
tered and sprinkled with grated bread. It may either 
be of stoneware or poreelain. If you have no souffle 
mould, any kind of a china dish that will stand heating 
will answer. t ■ :..<:• 

In baking^ the heat should never be too low nor too 
intense, and if possible do not get the heat- as strong 
from below, as from above. , - -.. • ■> 

Alid that will hold live embers is admirably adapted 
to inerease the requisite heat from the top. Themould 
ia bes^ placed on a small griddle which will permit its 
turning withoutshaking the souffle. If the lattershould 
brown on top too soon it may be protected by covering 
it with paper, but the first sheet should be buttered to 
prevent its adhering to the souffle. 

Souffles are not turned out of the mould, but are 
served in the dish in which they are baked, putting 
them on a plate and enveloped in a napkin.

butter and a broth prepared of extract of beef; if. liked, 
stir through it finely chopped ham. Then serve, covej> 
ing with some of the noodles browned in butter. 

The noodles can be prepared with bacon cut into 
cubes .and fried to a light brown color. 

Excepting the rice noodles, none are fit for invalids.

I. General Directions. The pan should preferably 
be. of steel, those of enameled ware are not so good; 
they should be used for pancakes and the like exclu^ 
sifely, and beefsteaks, onions, etc., should never be filed 
in them, as is so frequently done. The pan should be 
well wiped with soft paper after each time it is used, so 
that when again wanted it will only be necessary to 
simply nib it dry with a clean piece of absorbent papers 
If this is not done the. pan should first be put on the fire 
and cleaned with some salt. If the pan is washed 'the 
cakes will adhere to the bottom. Stir the batter with* 
warm instead of cold milk and beat it briskly before 
adding all the milk ; this method will improve the cakes 
very much. Whether it is, best to froth 1;he whites, of 
the eggs depends on, the taste. If this is done the cakes 
willbe nicely puffy and light, and it will take 1 egg less. 
Using the unbeaten eggs will permit of baking the cakes, 
nicely crisp externally. 

' ^A.tasredium. fire' is always bestfor baking pancakes ; 
a glowing coal fire will give the most satisfactdry re- 
sults. ' • . '■ : ! .< '-J'!-'.:: 

The: best fat to be used -consists of butter and sweet r 
lard, half and half, or else slowly, tried out pork fat ; see: - 
A, No. 18. In order to bake "the pancakes niee and » 
crisp put plenty of fat into the pan and let it meltj ■''■ 
being careful to prevent its getting brown or even too < 
hot, put in the dough uniformly thick over the bottom 
of the pan, pierce it with a knife occasionally, especially 
along the edges of the pan, until no. more of the liquid 
dough will appear on -the top. Turn the pan cautiously''

bo that the cake will bake nicely brown all over. If it 
should adhere anywhere put a little butter under it. 
Finally turn with a pancake turner and bake on the 
other side in the same way. In a few receipts corn- 
starch is put down instead of flour; be careful to test 
this before using as it is apt to be sour. 

2. German Wafers, ("Plinsen"). No. 1 . (To be served 
alone or as a side dish with spinach.) 4 heaping table- 
spoonfuls of flour, 4 large or 5 small eggs, 1-Iarge cup- 
ful of milk mixed with cream or milk and water, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, 2 ounces of washed and 
dried currants, grated lemon peel or mace and a little 
salt. When adding the eggs whip the dough as directed 
under No. 1, and bake four thin cakes. Then divide 
each cake in two," sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon 
and roll them out. 

These cakes are served for supper with tea and 
bread and butter. When served as a side dish send 
to the table with a white wine sauce or fruit jelly. If 
served with spinach leave out the sugar, lemon peel and 
currants, and stir through it some finely cut chives. 

3. Sour Craam Wafers. No. 2. 2 ounces of corn- 
starch, 4 eggs, 1 large cupful of thick sour cream, mace, 
cinnamon and a little salt. Smooth the cornstarch in 
2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, stir with it the yolks of 
eggs, cream and spiees, beat briskly and then lightly 
mix through it the beaten whites of the eggs, bake four 
large wafers and roll each one, sprinkle with sugar and 
cinnamon and bring to the table hot. When served 
with preserves they are very nice. 

4. Wafers filled with various Remnants such as 
Cooked Fruit or Veal. No. 3. Bake the wafers as directed 
in No. 1, spread with cooked apples, cherries, plum mar- 
malade or cranberries. Boil rice until thick, mix with 
sugar, cinnamon, and mace, spread over the wafer, roll 
it, and sprinkle with sugar. When using veal j-Oast, 
chop it very fine, brown a large piece of butter, stir a- 
little grated wheat bread and the meat in .this, add sour 
cream or bouillon, wine, mace or nutmeg and a little 
salt, and cook for a few minutes. Spread the wafer 
with this forcemeat, which is then baked, rolled and 
served on a hot dish. 



K.— Crullers, Omelettes, Etc. 265 

When using remnants of ham, which are then served 
with spinach, soak the ham in milk over night, then

and whipped to a stiff froth, which is mixed with the 
dough just before baking. The heat must be moderate 
and the pan very smooth. Melt a little butter in the 
pan, put the frothed dough into this, a hot tin cover 
over it and bake" the cracknels on one side, turn the pan 
without shaking it, and let it stand uutil the dough is 
set and browned on the under side. Then spread this 
with preserves, either apple or currant compot, marma- 
lade or jelly, fold, put on a dish and sprinkle with sugar 
and cinnamon. 

The cracknels can be spread on top with sugar and 
cinnamon and served with a wine-, fruit- or rum sauce. 
A nice way is to serve a compot of currants, which can 
also be spread over it ; the sauce is then omitted. 

A little baking powder mixed with the egg batter 
will help it to raise. For a simple dish make two tarts 
instead of one. Sprinkle one with lemon juice, put the 
other on top of this, and on this put a little fruit of any 
kind, or sugar.

L.— Dishes prepared with Eggs, 
Milk, Rice or Cornmeal. 



1. Boiling Eggs. To boil eggs so that they will be 
just right, they should not be put into the water until it 
boils. Soft boiled eggs require about 3 minutes, and 
medium hard boiled eggs 4 minutes. Eggs for decora- 
tions, where the whites must be firm and the yolks some- 
what softer, require 5 minutes. When a number of eggs 
are to be boiled at a time they are best put into a wire 
basket, by which means they can be easily taken out of 
the water. 

When eggs are to be used for decorating vegetable 
dishes, put them into cold water, and as soon as cold 
take them out of thte shell and warm them in salted 
water. 

2. Scrambled Eggs. Take 1 tablespoonful of milk, 
a little salt and a piece of butter the size of half a wal- 
nut for each egg. Beat the eggs, milk and salt together, 
melt the butter (a small earthenware vessel is the best 
for this purpose), pour in the eggs, and stir over a very 
slow fire until thick. Stir only until thick and done, 
then serve. Using water and bacon instead of the milk 
and butter, will make the eggs more spicy and is pre- 
ferred by many. 

Scrambled eggs are served with asparagus, lettuce, 
smoked herring, Summer sausage, cold tongue and 
smoked meats. With the last three, some finely chopped 
chives should be mixed with the beaten eggs. 

Scrambled egg dishes can be varied in many ways 
by the admixture of stewed and sliced mushrooms, small 



274 L. — Egg, Mjlk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 

boiled asparagus tips, a few pieces of boned anchovy, 
minced salmon and a few spoonfuls of grated cheese of 
any kind. 

If this dish is to be served as an entree after the 
soup, it should first be filled into warmed sauce dishes, 
mix with it sliced truffles and diced sweet breads boiled 
in bouillon, and afterwards cover with strips of salmon. 
For the family table mix cheese with the eggs before 
they are beaten and after the cups are filled brush with 
puree of tomatoes or else cover with bits of bologna 
(cervelat) sausage and put a border of slips of toasted 
wheat bread on each cup. , 

In the Spring a nice dish of scrambled eggs can be 
prepared for the supper table as follows : 'Clean ' some 
young red and white radishes, leave a blade of green on 
the top, slit the peel towards the top with a sharp knife 
and loosen without removing them from the radish, 
then lay them into cold water for a few hours, which will 
cause the skin to curl nicely, after which let them drain. 
Out some round slices of wheat bread, hollow them out 
in the center, toast slightly and fill with a small bunch 
of cresses dressed with olive oil and a trifle of salt. Boil 
3 truffles until tender and slice them. 1 eggs are then 
scrambled, lay them into the center of a hot dish, cover 
with the toast and surround.with the sliced truffles and 
the radishes as a border. 

4. Poached Eggs. Bring some water to a boll with 
a little salt and vinegar. Break into it some fresh eggs 
rapidly, but they must be dropped in side by side. As 
soon as the whites are set (they must not become hard) 
take them out of the water, if desired they can be 
apr.JTi]/lori ™\f\\ a little vinegar, trim the edges smoothly 
all around, sprinkle with fine salt and serve either on a 
dish of spinach or with the latter as a side dish. r 

As an entree after the soup, poached eggs can be 
served for the family table with an anchovy-, herring-, 

/■sorrel- or Remoulade sauce over the eggs, ornamenting 
the dish with slips of toast. For a dinner party line a 
dish rather thickly with the following well bound sauce : 

. Lightly brown a few onions and slices of ham in butter, 
rub in this 2 spoonfuls of flour and add bouillon and 
cream half and half to make a well-bound sauce, which 
is then strained ; then put in about 2 ounces of grated 



L.— Egg, Milk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 275 

Parmesan cheese, stir through it' the whites of 2 eggs 
beaten to a froth and line the dish with half of this 
sauce. Arrange the poached eggs in the dish, pour over 
them the remainder of the sauce, sprinkle with bread 
crumbs and cheese and then bake to a light brown. 

5. Fried Eggs. Heat some butter in a very clean 
pan and break the eggs into it very carefully, keeping 
each egg whole; sprinkle over them a little fine salt, 
and when the whites are set put them on a dish without 
turning them, trim the edges and serve with spinach or 
other similar vegetables. 

Fried' eggs can be served with the following sauce 
and they then make an agreeable dish for the supper 
table: For 4 persons take about 2 eggs, 1 heaping tea- 
spoonful of flour or cornstarch, 1 large cupful of water, 
vinegar according to taste and enough sugar to make 
the vinegar mild. Stir all of this until it commences to 
boil, and stir through it a piece of butter the size of half 
an egg. Pour the sauce over the eggs while they are 
still hot, cover and set aside for a few minutes on top of 
the stove. If fried eggs are to be served as an entree 
after the soup, prepare them as follows : Cut a long loaf 
of wheat bread into slices, remove the center without 
breaking the crust and fry these rings in lard to a 
golden brown. Lay the rings on a flat dish lined with 
anchovy butter, brush them with thick sour cream, 
break an egg into each, salt, dot with some sour cream, 
cover with butterad paper and bake until the whites are 
set. A border of whole filled tomatoes is very pretty. 

6. Eggs with Mustard Sauce. Shell medium soft 
boiled eggs, divide them in two lengthwise,, put them 
into a dish with the yolks to the top, sprinkle lightly 
with salt and pour over them a mustard sauce (see 
Division R), or else melted butter stirred with mustard. 

7. Filled Eggs. Take hard boiled eggs and cut 
them in two, remove the yolks, mince and mix one-half 
of them with chopped anchovies, mushrooms, small 
pieces of tongue or ham and the yolk of one raw egg. 
Stir the remainder of the yolks to a thick sauce with 
mustard, olive oil, tarragon vinegar, salt and pepper, 
mix a part of this with the minee to make a smooth 
forcemeat, fill it into the hollowed whites of the eggs, 



276 L.— Egg, Milk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 

and pour over them the remainder of the sauce. Hot 
filled eggs make a nice entree after the soup. The filling 
can be prepared in various ways, taking either a fi-sti. 
forcemeat or else a finely minced veal sweetbread- or 
chicken ragout. A simpler method is to grate the yolks 
of the eggs and mix them to a forcemeat with savory 
herbs, grated bread, grated cheese and some bouillon. 
Part of the filling should always be used to line the 
bottom of the fiat dish ; arrange the filled eggs on this, 
dot with butter, sprinSle with bread crumbs and ba.ke 
to a golden brown. 

8. Egg Hound. Cut the whites of 6 hard boiled 
eggs into fine strips, stew them in a Bechamel sauce, 
(see Division R), and put them on a small hot dish in 
the shape of a mound. Rub the yolks with a piece of 
fresh butter and some salt and press through a sieve 
over the whites. Cover with bits of toast, and then get 
it nicely hot in the oven. 

9. Eggs in flarinade. Shell 18 hard boiled eggs 
and put them into a stOne jar. Boil 1 quart of vinegar, 
% ounce of pepper, % ounce of Jamaica pepper and % 
ounce of ginger for about 10 minutes; pour through a 
sieve over the eggs. After the vinegar is cold, tightly 
cover the jar by tieing over it a piece of paper. After 
3 — i weeks serve the eggs with bread and butter. 

10. Raw Whites of Eggs for Invalids. Beat the 
whites, to a stiff froth, slowly add 1 tablespoonful of 
thick sweet cream, 1 spoonful of brandy, 1 teaspoonful 
of fine sugar. Adminster to the patient at once, a 
spoonful at a time. 

11. Egg Cheese. 9—10 eggs are well beaten and 
then stirred over a slow fire with 1 quart of milk and a 
little salt until it curdles ; it should npt become too hot. 
Pour it into a mould rapidly so that the eggs may 
remain soft. A few currants previously scalded in boil- 
ing water can be scattered through the mass. If not 
wanted for immediate use the cheese will be milder if-the 
milk mixed with tne eggs is first poured into a stone 
jar and this put into a kettle containing boiling water, 
and then continuously boiling the milk until it curdles. 
Drop pieces of almonds over the cheese and serve with a 



L.— Egg, Milk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 277 

sauce made of sour cream beaten to a froth with sugar 
and cinnamon and mixed with arrac. A cold wine- or 
fruit sauce is also appropriate. 

12. Egg Jelly. 1 quart of milk, 4 beaten eggs and 
the yolks of 5 eggs, 1 grated lemon, sugar and cinna- 
mon are put into a deep vessel, cover and set over boil- 
ing water until thick. As soon as cold sprinkle with 
sugar and serve with a cranberry sauce or some other 
well flavored com pot. 

13. Beaten Milk. Beat thick milk and its cream 
with a beater briskly for 15 minutes. Stir through it 
sugar and cinnamon and serve with toast. A glassful 
of claret can also be beaten with it. 

14. Sour Milk Cheese. Set a pan of thick milk with- 
out the cream near the stove so that it will gradually 
separate from the watery parts. Pour into a muslin 
bag and afterwards press through a sieve. Mix with it 
fresh cream or milk and sugar and vanilla according to 
taste. Another method is to fill the cold sour milk into 
the bag and let it hang during the night to permit the 
watery parts to drip away. This makes the cheese 
smoother and mellower than if the milk is warmed, but 
it is mixed with sugar and cream or fresh milk in the 
same manner. After putting it into the dish and' 
smoothing the top, sprinkle with sugar and a little 
ginger, or else pour over it some sour cream beaten to 
a froth with sugar and cinnamon. If no cream is mixed 
with the cheese it must not be made too thick, and it 
should be taken into consideration that this cheese 
thickens naturally when done, similar to boiled . rice. 
Many like sour milk cheese with cranberries, grapes or 
cherry compot. 

15. Rice Pudding. Take about % pound of rice and 
2 quarts.of milk. Scald the rice as directed in A, No. 5, 
melt a piece of butter in the milk which will thereby 
be prevented from scorching, and bring it to a boil. 
Put in the rice together with a few pieces of cinnamon — 
those not liking the flavor of cinnamon may prefer 
vanilla — afterwards add a little sugar and a trifle of 
salt, put the rice into a dish and sprinkle with sugar; it 
is often dressed with melted butter. If the rice is to be 



278 L.— Egg, Milk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 

served cold, remember that it thickens materially when 
cooling. Before serving stir through it the yolks of a 
few eggs together with a dash of rum or cordial, other- 
wise the pudding will be apt to have an insipid taste. 

Remnants of rice pudding can be used for rice ome- 
lette, (K, No. 27), or to fill wafers (K, No. 4), or it 
may be made into small dumplings which are baked in 
melted butter and turned in grated chocolate while still 
hot. 

16. Rice with Claret for Invalids. Let 3 ounces of 
rice come to a boil in cold water, pour in 1 pint of claret, 

2 teaspoonfuls of lemon sugar and a little cinnamon; 
boil until done. Serve hot with sweetened cream stirred 
with the yolk of an egg. 

17. Rice with Apples. Scald the .rice, which should 
be of the very best quality ; then melt a piece of butter 
in a pan, put in the rice with boiling water, a piece of 
cinnamon and a little salt, and boil slowly. When the 
rice is almost tender put in the apples with a large piece 
of sugar, cook until done, but it must not be too thick ; 
stir carefully so that the kernels will remain whole. A 
glassful of white wine can also be stirred through the 
rice. Sprinkle the top with sugar and serve. 

For % pound of rice take 6 medium-sized apples, 
pare and cut into eight parts. This will be sufficient for 

3 persons. 

18. Rice with Raisins. (A nice dish for convales- 
cents.) After the rice is scalded, boil for % hour as 
directed in the above receipt, then add raisins and cook 
until both are tender, but they must not become mushy. 

19. Rice for Ragout. For 2 dishes take 1 pound of 
rice, scald and cook in bouillon untiltender, stir through 
it a glassful of Madeira, 1 cupful of cream, the yolks of 
2 eggs and X pound of Parmesan cheese, and surround 
with it a ragout of poultry or veal. 

20. Arabian Rice. Boil some scalded rice in salted 
water for 20 minutes, pour off the water and set it in a 
warm oven for 10 minutes, stirring often, before bring- 
ing to the table. Serve this rice with roasted or boiled 
meats. 



L.-^Egg, Mjlk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 279 

21. Turin Rice. % pound of rice is washed in cold 
water, dried with a cloth and Med in a pan with grated 
onion and 3 ounces of .butter to a light brown color. 
Then mix 1 glassful of white wine with a little lemon 
juice and.l small cupful of strong bouillon and boil the 
rice until tender; before sending to the table stir in salt 
and pepper. Serve with stewed meat. Substituting 
Madeira for the" whitf wine, and the addition of sliced 
and stewed truffles will add greatly to the excellence of 
this rice preparation. 

22. Rice in a Bag. 1% pounds of rice, or % pound of 
rice and % pound of barley, or % pound of prunes and % 
pound of raisins. Rice, raisins and prunes are washed, 
scalding the latter. Then take a very clean cloth, dip 
into boilingwater, wring it dry, put the ingredients into 
the cloth in layers with a little salt, tie^Jeaving room 
for the rice to expand, put this into a pan of boiling 
water, first putting a saucer into„the bottom to keep 
the cloth from scorching, and boil for 2 hours. Serve 
with browned butter and sugar, or with roast meat and 
gravy or raw ham. The following is a nice sauce, and 
smoked meats are a fitting accompaniment: For the 
above quantity take 1 tablespoonful of flour, milk, the 
yolk of an egg, a piece of butter, sugar and a little salt, 
put on the stove until it commences to boil. The sauce 
must not be too thick. To have this dish just right be 
careful not to leave too much room for the rice, as then 
it will become too thin, neither must the bag be drawn 
up too tightly, for then the rice will become too thick ; 
it is advisable to examine the bag during the cooking 
to ascertain whether it is too tight or not. 

23. Sago Compot. Cook ]i pound of pearl sago in 1 
cupful of water, 1 cupful of wine, 2 spoonfuls of rasp- 
berry juice, 2 ounces of sugar and a little pineapple 
extract. Then mix with the sago some preserved pears 
and cherries, put the compot into a pan, pour over it 
an icing made of 1 ounce of pounded almonds, 1 ounce 
of sugar, the yolks of 3 eggs, bake the compot for 
y± hour in a moderate oven and serve while still hot. 
For a plain dish take sugar, water, lemon peel and juice 
and at last a few spoonfuls of raisins or currants, or 
some quartered apples stewed in wine and sugar. 



280 L.— Egg, Milk, Rice and Cornmeal Dishes. 

~ 24. Noodles. For 8 — 10 persons. 4 whole eggs, 4 
tablespoonfuls of milk and as much flour as the eggs 
and milk will take. Put the flour into a. dish, make a 
depression in the center, put in eggs and milk, stir with 
a knife to a light dough and then mix with the hands 
until it is smooth. The .longer the dough is kneaded 
the better the noodles will be. Then cut into four parts, 
roll each part as thin as paper and set aside to dry. 
When the fourth piece is rolled, take the first, dust with 
flour, cut in two, roll each piece, cut it into narrow 
strips, and then let it dry; they can also be used imme- 
diately. Cook the noodles in plenty of boiling salted 
water' for about % hour, drain on a colander and then 
pour boiling water through them. 

Serve with browned butter. Or boil milk with a 
large piece of butter and a little salt, let the noodles 
boil in this, then serve, covering the noodles with rolled 
cracker browned in butter. Then, too, the noodles can 
be covered with crisp noodles, by frying some uncooked" 
noodles until crisp in butter; or the noodles can be cov- 
ered with grated brown bread. Roast veal or dried 
prunes area nice dish with noodles; apple marmarade 
is also a fitting accompaniment. 

25. Rice with Tomatoes. After frying some scalded 
rice for % hour in butter, cook it in bouillon until tender 
and thick, then stir in some finely cut onions stewed in 
butter, salt and pepper, some pieces of ham and some 
ripe stewed tomatoes. Serve the rice with beefsteaks 
and lambchops. Usewhatrice remains fortomato soup. 

26. Barley with Sour Cream. Scald the barley and 
fry it in butter for 10 — 15 minutes and then cook in 
milk until done. Add'the necessary salt, stir through 
it some sour cream whipped with a few eggs, put the 
barley into a mould and bake for half an hour to a 
light brown color. Serve with sweet cream for- supper. 

27. Boiled Flour Groats. Make a dough the same 
as noodle dough, roll very thin, divide into small pieces 
and cut them as fine as groats with a chopping knife. 
If the dough is very stiff it can be grated. This is very 
nice when used in milk soups. 

For Invalids Nos. 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 23 
and 26 are adapted. 



M. — Jellies and Ices. 



1. The various Stocks for Jellies are prepared from 
isinglass, calves' and pigs' feet, and gelatine. Isinglass 
makes the finest, clearest and handsomest jellies. The 
leaf like variety, which when held to the light has a 
bluish tint, is the best. Break the isinglass into small 
pieces, put it into a very clean stone jar, cover with 
water, let it stand over night and the next- morning 
boil it for a quarter of an hour on a slow fire or, better 
still, on top of the stove, which should not be too hot, 
until dissolved. If the quality is good it will dissolve 
almost completely and have the appearance of clear 
water. Strain through muslin and use according to 
-directions. For 2 quarts of jelly take 1 tablespoonful 
of isinglass. 

Calves' feet jelly is more troublesome to make than 
when using isinglass, but it is much cheaper and at the 
same time very palatable. The stock can be prepared 
in the following manner: The calves' feet for jelly of 
every kind should be singed so that the skin will be per- 
fectly clean, then wash them thoroughly and let them 
lay in lukewarm water for a few hours to draw and 
bleach. Cut them into small pieces and put them on 
the fire in an enameled kettle containing cold water; as 
soon as the water has boiled and the scum has been 
carefully taken off, pour off the water, fill up again with 
fresh water and put onto the stove again with a quick 
fire. Then boil the calves' feet uninterruptedly for 3, 
4 or 5 hours with frequent stirring until they drop to 
pieces, take them out of the kettle, pour some water 
over them, and this water should then be added to the 
other broth, which must be well boiled down, and after 
taking off the fat pass through a fine sieve into a por- 



282 M.— Jellies and Ices., 

■> celain or earthenware jar and set aside until the follow- 
ing day. Before using the jelly the fatty outer skin and 
the settlings at the bottom should be removed. 

To prepare 2 quarts of jelly use 6 calves' feet in the 
Winter and 8 in the Summer, and the broth of these 
should be boiled down to about a pint. This kind of 
stock can be used for wine-, meat- or fish jellies. In 
making stock of pork rind or pigs' feet, be careful to 
have everything perfectly clean, cut into very small 
pieces and boil the same as calves' feet. Take 1 pound 
of rind for each quart of jelly, which is also very good. 

Gelatine is used very much the same as isinglass 
and although not quite so good as the latter, it is 
much cheaper and for this reason extensively used. It 
is obtainable in small cakes of a yellowish white, clear 
or even of a pretty red tint. The best gelatine comes 
in thin cakes and is very clear. 

Gelatine is used not only in the preparation of 
blanc-m angers, meat- or fish jellies, but also for clear 
, sweet jellies. It is dissolved in the following manner: 
Cut it into small pieces with the scissors, for each ounce 
. of gelatine put a cupful of cold water into a small vessel 
and set it on top of a hot stove; it will be fully dis- 
solved after % or 1 hour, and then take off the scum 
with great care. In case the gelatine is wanted for im- 
mediate use, put it on a medium fire with a little more 
water; keep it on the fire until it is dissolved and stir 
frequently so that it will not adhere to the sides of the 
vessel. For clear jellies the gelatine should be strained 
or otherwise clarified, but this is not necessary with the 
best kinds. For a quart of liquid jelly take a table- 
spoonful of gelatine in the Winter, and 1% tablespoon- 
fuls in the Summer, but the quantity depends alto- 
gether on the kinds of dishes for which it is to be used. 
% of a spoonful of gelatine is sufficient to transform a 
quart of milk into a jelly firm enough to turn onto a 
dish. Water, wine, bouillon, etc., require about 1% 
tablespoonfuls to a quart. If cold meats are to be slitfed 
and jellied, the jelly should be firmer and for every 
quart of fluid jelly take a good ounce of gelatine. It is 
advisable to make a test of the stock before preparing 
the jelly in order to ascertain beyond any doubt whether 
it possesses the required consistency;, at all events it is 



M.— Jellies and Ices. 288 

necessary to prepare the jelly the day before it is to be 
used, especially in the Summer. 

2. Jelly in rioulds, etc. Porcelain and enameled 
moulds a,re the best and easiest to keep clean. In order 
that jellies may drop out of the mould readily, the 
latter should be thinly brushed with almond or olive oil. 
Then put in a layer of sour jelly broth about \ inch 
thick for fish or meat. As soon as firm ornament it 
with a star or border, using for this purpose parsley, 
lemon, beets, hard boiled eggs, pickles or capers; cover 
the ornamentation with jelly broth and as soon as it is 
firm, nicely arrange the meat or fish on it and pour 
over the whole the remaining broth and let it stand 
until entirely firm ; if the mould can be placed on ice it 
will be done so much the quicker. To turn the jelly out 
of the mould put the dish in which it is to be served 
accurately onto the mould, then grasping them both 
tightly turn quickly, trim the edge neatly and garnish 
with parsley if it is a sour jelly, and with flower buds if 
it is a sweet one. 

If, after .the jelly is cool and firm, it will not drop 
out of the mould easily after all, soak a towel in hot 
water, wring it dry and wind it around the mould for a 
few moments, or eise hold the mould over boiling water 
for a short time ; the jelly will then drop out. 

3. . Coloring Jellies. Jellies may be colored in vari- 
ous tints if they are to be used in layers, or a clear jelly 
can be ornamented with some colored jelly. For red 
jelly dissolve some red gelatine^ b ut boil it thoroughly, 
w,hieh will improve the taste. 

To obtain a yellow tint put a small quantity of 
saffron into w ater to draw and use enough of the yellow 
'li'qiTicfTo give the jelly the desired color. Saffron should 
be 'Used with cauti on ^ as it is po^onous in undue

colored put a thin layer of it into a prepared porcelain 
dish and let it stand until cool. 

If a number of jelly dishes are to be served at a 
large dinner party, prepare one of them in red and the 
others in light colors, and then ornament them with 
contrasting colors ; Jor instance make some triangular 
ornaments of red jelly and arrange them around the 
edge of a light jelly. Then cut a rose or other flower of 
red jelly and put it into the center of the dish. Red 
jellies can be very prettily decorated with white or yellow 
ornaments. 



I. SOUR JELLIES. 

4. Sour Jellies of Calves' Feet for Fish and Heat. 

Jellies can be quickly, and easily prepared by using 
extract of beef and gelatine, which will make a strong 
and clear thick jelly. When cooking the jelly an enam- 
eled kettle is the best. Iron is not well adapted for 
cooking jellies, as the acid in the jelly acts upon the iron 
and gives the jellies an unpleasant flavor. 

For a sour jelly 4 — 5 blanched calves' feet, as given 
under No. 1, and 2—4 pounds of beef, washed, a piece of 
veal, remnants of any kind of fresh meat or poultry can 
be used (but nothing from the head, through which the 
jelly will become dark), and some raw ham cut into 
small pieces. Cover with boiling water, add some salt, 
cook rapidly, skimming carefully, and add 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of white peppercorns, half as manycloves, 10 escha- 
lots or 4 large onions, 2 fresh bay leaves, 1 carrot, 
parsley root, half of a celery root, the juice a,nd the 
thinly peeled rind of 1 lemon, and enough vinegar to 
give the broth a pleasant flavor. Let the vegetables 
cook for an hour, boil the meat in this until tender and 
let the feet cook until the bones can be taken out. Then 
pour the broth (which will amount to about 2 quarts) 
through a sieve into a porcelain kettle; the next day 
take off the fat and settlings and mix % bottle of wine 
with the jelly and the juice of a lemon and' set on the 
stove; taste it to see if it is sour and salty enough. 
Then clear the jelly in the following manner: Beat up 
the whites of a few eggs with a little water, stir into the 



Sour Jellies. 285 

warm broth and set on the hot stove until the broth is 
quite clear, then strain through a flannel bag; if not 
perfectly clear it can be strained again, though once will 
usually suffice. 

5. Sour Jelly for Fish and Meat. Take a nice lean 
piece of beef, say about 2%— 3 pounds, put it into an 
enameled kettle and pour over it enough cold water 
with salt to make a strong bouillon, bring quickly to a 
boil, skimming carefully. After it has cooked for half 
an hour take out the meat, rinse off any scum that may 
adhere to it and set the broth aside to settle. After it 
has settled, pour off the top into a clean dish, add half 
of a celery root, a piece of parsley root, 4 white onions, 
the peel of a lemon with the juice, 2 fresh b*ay leaves, 
2 teaspoonfuls of white peppercorns. % teaspoonful of 
cloves and enough wine vinegar to give the jelly a sour 
taste; add a little salt if necessary. Cover the kettle 
and let the bouillon cook until the meat is tender. 
Then pour the broth, of which there should be about 
lJis quarts, through a muslin cloth, set aside in a warm 
place so that it will not cool too rapidly, and when it is 
cold take off the settlings. In the meantime dissolve 
1% ounces of gelatine in 1 pint of water, strain through 
muslin, bring to a boil with the bouillon and pour over 
the fish or poultry . 

6. Jelly of Beef or Poultry, etc. The meat should 
be nicely washed and freed from fat. Poultry, excepting 
geese, can be larded, turning the lardoons in salt and 
cutting the ends smooth; take the bones out of the 
turkey and the goose as given under D, No. 169. Put. 
the meat into an enameled kettle in water and enough 
white wine vinegar to give it a sour taste, put in the 
necessary salt, skim carefully, add the spices as given 
in the above receipt, cover, let it cook slowly and then 
take it out of the broth and set aside to cool. Put into 
one large or several small dishes; the small dishes are 
preferable. Pour through a sieve and the following day 
take off fat and settlings and for each quart of broth 
take 1 pint of stock made of 4 calves' feet, or for the 
same quantity take 1 ounce of dissolved gelatine. 

7. Salmon in Jelly. Boil some water and white 
pepper, lemon slices without seeds, onions, mace, a littlo 



286 M— Jellies and Ices. 

salt, 2 — 3 bay leaves and the necessary vinegar (it is 
better to use fruit wine, lemon juice and vinegar half 
and half) in an enameled kettle for a while, pour through 
a sieve, then add to this the salmon, first cut into pieces 
and salted for an hour. Boil until tender-, then take 
out the salmon and set aside to cool. For each 2 
pounds of salmon there should bel quart of jelly ; make 
the latter by using a strong, clear, white beef, veal or 
poultry bouillon. Cook this with 1 pint of white wine 
and 1 ounce of gelatine, salt and spice and season with 
a little lemon juice and pour this lukewarm over the 
salmon pieces. Decorate the edge with pickled crabtails. 

8. Eel in Jelly. This" makes a very pretty dish if 
the right mould is used. The eel is not skinned but is 
divided into pieces, first rubbing it with salt to take_off 
any slime, empty, take off the fins, pour warm vinegar 
over it and let it come to a boil in unsalted water. 
Then lay the pieces into a stew pan with bay leaves, 
lemon slices, eschalots, salt, peppercorns, sage leaves 
and parsley, with enough water and vinegar, half and 
half, to cover the eel. After it has boiled for % hour, 
take out the eel, skin off the fat and pour through a 
sieve; dissolve 1 ounce of gelatine for .each quart and 
add to the broth, bring to a boil again, salt, pour into 
a mould putting in the pieces of eel and sliced lemon. 
Then let the jelly cool and turn into a dish. Serve with 
a Remoulade- or a good Mayonnaise sauce. 

9. Jelly of Sardines or Caviar. Make a clear meat 
jelly as given under No. 4 or 5, let it cool until lukewarm, 
and pour into a round form to the thickness of about 
% inch. Bury in ice until frozen, then dry the sardines 

.between blotting paper, and arrange them in the mould 
in the form of a rosette, cover these also with the jelly 
and when this layer is frozen fill the empty space in the 
middle with caviar; close the mould with aspic and bury 
in ice until wanted. After the mould has been turned 
on a round dish cover it for a moment with a cloth 
dipped in hotwater and wrung dry; by this means the 
mould can be emptied more readily. 

10. Jelly with Rabbit. The hind legs and the back 
of a rabbit are washed, skinned, washed again bub not 
laid in the water, and boiled in an earthenware or enam- 



Sour Jellies. 287 

eled (not iron) kettle in water with enough vinegar to 
give it a sour taste ; skim carefully. Then add a sliced 
lemon, 8 eschalots or 4 onions, 2 teaspoonfuls of pepper- 
corns and 2 teaspoonfuls of cloves, let the meat cook 
slowly until tender, take it out and after the broth is 
_ strained set it in a cool place. In the meantime make a 
"strong bouillon and a jelly of 3—4 calves' feet as given 
in No. 1. After it is cold take off fat and settlings, 
and bring to a boil with the bouillon and the rabbit 
broth, freed from settlings. The jelly broth must have 
a strong sour taste. There should be about 1% quarts; 
should there be more than this quantity color it as 
given under No. 3, and use for decorating. Gelatine 
and extract of beef can be used instead of the calves' 
feet, saving time and trouble in preparing. 

Then make a liver forcemeat as follows: Wash a 
calves' liver, skin, wash, pound flnelyand press through 
a sieve. Cut % pound of bacon into small pieces, chop 
with % pound of pork and mix with a cupful of crackers 
or grated wheat bread, the yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs, 
1 cupful of butter melted and cleared from settlings, 
salt and pepper. The forcemeat is put into a buttered 
souffle mould and baked in the oven until clone. When 
cold cut into slices; the rabbit is also sliced. Then rub 
the jelly mould with oil, fill the bottom with jelly broth, 
and when cold lay the meat and forcemeat on this in 
layers, and over each layer put some jelly broth, let it 
cool and proceed in this manner until all the broth is 
used. 

This jelly will keep in the Winter for 10 to 14 days 
if the jelly is made quite thick, and set aside uncovered 
in an airy place. When serving, turn out of the pan, 
decorate prettily with a wreath of small parsley leaves 
and red beets cut into long slices. Serve with an a la 
Diable sauce (No. 55, R,) or a sauce for jellies. 

11. Jelly of Salted Tongue with Extract of Beef. 

After the tongue is salted and cooked until tender as 
given under Division D, No. 30, boil % pound of beef 
according to No. 5 of this Division with the ingredients 
there given together with 1% quarts of bouillon, pour 
off the settlings, dissolve 1 ounce of gelatine and bring 
to a boil with the broth which must not be more than 
1% quarts, try the sauce to see if salty and sour enough, 



288 M. — Jellies and Ices. 

fake from the fire and proceed as directed tinder No. 2. 
In the meantime cut the tongue into slices of even size 
and cut off the rind. If the broth when cold is suffi- 
ciently thick, stir through it enough hot extract of 
beef to give it a pleasant flavor. Then let a layer of the 
jelly cool in the mould, lay the tongue slices on this, 
and around the dish some button onions boiled until" 
tender in water with plenty of wine vinegar and a little 
salt, over this put the remaining broth and proceed as 
given under No. 2. 

12. Beef RoyaI<. A piece of nice beef, weighing from 
8 — 10 pounds is laid into vinegar for a week. Lard, 
cook slowly with 8 calves' feet, bay leaves, eschalots, a 
sliced lemon, white pepper, salt and 1% — 2 bottles of 
claret for 3 hours, covered tightly. Then take out the 
meat, add some browned sugar, and pour the broth- 
over the meat through a sieve, 

13. Veal in Jelly. No. 1. Cut a piece of veal into 
small square pieces, wash in hot 'water and bring" to a 
boil with 4 scalded calves' feet, and salt. After skim- 
ming add plenty of vinegar, peppercorns, onions, whole 
and ground cloves, a few bay leaves, lemon peel and a 
few blades of mace, cook the meat slowly; then take out 
the meat and if there is still too much broth, boil it 
down with the calves' feet until it will form jelly when 
cold ; then take out the calves' feet, stir through it the 
beaten whites of a few eggs, and let the broth stand on 
the back of the stove for an hour, it must not boil, then 
pour through a jelly bag. Take the meat from the 
bones, remove all unnecessary fat, put into a buttered 
pan a,nd pour the jelly broth over it. Instead of calves' 
feet gelatine can be used. 

Serve with an a la Diable sauce, (E, No. 55). To 
keep the jelly for any length of time it should be placed 
uncovered in a cool place. 

14. Veal in Jelly. No. 2. (Very nice in the Summer). 
Cut pieces of veal as for a fricassee, lay into a deep 
earthenware jar with sliced lemon and cloves between 
the slices, and when the jar is filled sprinkle with, the 
necessary salt; then pour over them a mixture of % 
vinegar and % water, cover the jar by tieing over it a 
piece of parchment or something similar. Then put it 



Sour Jellies, 289 

into an iron kettle filled with water and boil for* 3 
hours. 

A few bones are necessary to fill into the jar with 
the meat so as not to have the meat packed too tightly 
together, in order that the jelly will form. Serve an a la 
Diable sauce (R, No. 55), or mustard and sugar with 
the meat. 

15. Calves' Head Jelly will be found under veal, (D, 
. No. 83J\ 

16. Pork Ribs in Jelly. This will be found in Divi- 
sion W. 

17. Filled Capon in Jelly, with Sauce. Bone a capon 
and fill with the following forcemeat (which is enough 
for 2 capons): Grate % pound of bread and stir on the 
fire with % pound of butter, then take from the stove, 
add to it the finely chopped livers of-both capons, 2 — 3 
yolks of eggs, 1 pound of minced veal, % pound of 
minced pork fat, some thick cream, salt, mace, a little 
chopped lemon peel and juice with the beaten whites of 
the eggs. 

Stir well together and fill the capon with it, and tie 
around the capon some large thin pork fat slices, put it 
into some good bouillon, cover tightly and boil for 
2— 2% hours. Then take out of the broth, lay on a flat 
dish, let it cool for 1 hour, take off the slices of fat and 
puta weight on the capon to press it a little. The broth 
in which the capon was cooked is stirred with gelatine 
(about 1 ounce to a quart), add the necessary salt, and 
as much lemon juice as will give the broth a nice sour 
taste, bring to a boil again and then strain through a 
jelly bag. If it is clear, straining once will answer. 
Then- pour enough of the broth into the form to make a 
layer, let it cool, lay the capon into the pan with the 
breast to the bottom (it can also be cut into slices),. 
pour over it the remaining broth, the next day turn 
out on the dish on which it is to be served, and pour 
around it the following sauce ; One large spoonful of 
thick cream, or the yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs are 
stirred with 2 teaspoonfuls of mustard and the same 
quantity of sugar; then gradually stir with it 4 table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, some 
finely chopped tarragon, a little pepper and salt, and 



290 M.— Jellies and Ices.- 

some of the remaining jelly broth. Stir all of this well 
together, pour around the capon and decorate with 
capers. 

18. Spring Chicken in Jelly. When the chickens are 
prepared as directed for roasting, press in the breast 
bone and then take it out. Then rub with salt, and 
stew with butter and water — covering the pan tightly — 
until tender, take out of the dish and let it cool. In the 
meantime put a layer of jelly broth into the dish and let 
this cool also. The form must not be larger than the 
dish on which the jelly is to be -served. Then lay the 
cold meat on the cooled jelly, and cover this with the 
somewhat cooled jelly broth. The next day turn onto 
the dish and decorate as given under No. 2, or with 
chopped sour jelly. 

19. Chicken Mayonnaise with Jelly. After the chick- 
ens are cleaned, stew them in butter, bouillon and lemon 
juice until tender, set aside to cool, take out the bones 
and cut into pieces, lay into a porcelain dish, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, pour over it tarragon vinegar and 
salad oil, and leave in this marinade for a few hours. 

In the meantime brush a pan with olive oil, fill with 
sour jelly, and after it is cool, turn onto a flat dish. 
Then put the pieces of chicken into thecenter of the dish 
in the shape of a mound ; decorate with crabtails and 
hearts of lettuce after dipping them into the sauce. 

20. Turkey in Jelly. The turkey should be young 
and should be killed 2 — 3 days before using. It is filled 
with a dressing as directed for capon in jelly, No. 17, or 
in the above receipt. Prepare as above. 

21. Ducks in Jelly. The duck must be young and 
prepared the same as for capon in jelly, cut it into 
slices, lay around a long dish, put the jelly on this and 
serve with a Remoulade sauce (Division R, No. 56). 

22. Filled Goose in Jelly. Take a young but not 
too fat goose, which must be killed 2 — 3 days before 
using. After perfectly cleaning it cut off the legs, wings, 
head and negk, which are taken for giblets togetherwith 
the heart and stomach (see D, Nos. 205 — 206). Bone 
the goose and fill it the same as capon in jelly, using the 
liver, or as given for roasted turkey. Calves' feet stock, 



Sour Jellies. 291 

or else gelatine, 1 ounce for each quart, can be taken to 
make the jelly. When using calves' feet put them on the 
fire with the goose barely covered with water, with not 
too much salt, skim carefully, add the spices as given in 
No. 1, also some vinegar, take off all of the fat, cover 
tightly, and cook slowly until tender, which will take 
2%— 3 hours. Then take out of the broth, which should 
be boiled down to about 2%— 3 quarts, clear the broth 
and proceed as directed for capon in jelly. 

The goose can also be prepared without filling, the 
same as a capon ; lay the pieces into the form and pour 
the jelly over it. 

23. Veal in Jelly. Cut 2 pounds of veal into thin 
slices, spread with a nice forcemeat seasoned with 
chopped truffles or mushrooms stewed in butter, roll, 
tie with a strong thread and cook in a rich bouillon 
with 1 glassful of wine, a little salt, pepper and onions 
until tender, then take out of the broth. Take the fat 
off the broth, dissolve about % ounce of gelatine in 
water and % ounce of extract of beef for each 1 quart of 
broth, add the necessary salt, and bring to a boil with 
some lemon juice. Clear with the beaten whites of 2 — 3 
eggs, as given under No. 4, and pour through aeieve. 
After removing the thread from the roulades, lay them 
into a deep dish, pour the lukewarm jelly over them and 
when serving, turn them onto an appropriate dish. A 
large roll can be made of a boned calves' breast spread 
with forcemeat. It is improved by the addition of 
truffles, eggs, tongue, cucumbers and pork fat slices, 
also anchovies, pistachios, capers, etc., before rolling; 
then stew until tender. Press between two slabs over 
night, cut into slices, arrange in a mould in the form of 
a wreath, cover with jelly and when cold turn out of the 
mould. Put endives or lettuce dressed with a mayon- 
naise sauce into the center of the jelly border and serve 
the mayonnaise separately. 

Nos. 10, 13, 17, 18, 20 and 23 can be used for mak- 
ing sour jellies for invalids, but they should not be 
served with rich sauces.

II: SWEET CLEAR JELLIES. 

Note. — It may be well to repeat here that when 
jellies cannot be placed upon ice in the Summer, they 
should be prepared the day before. Directions for color- 
ing and ornamenting jellies are given under No. 3 of 
this Division. 

24. Wine Jellies made with Calves' Feet. For 4 

quarts of stock take 12 large calves' feet and cook as 
directed in No. 1. Then put on the stove with 1% 
pounds of sugar, % ounce of stick cinnamon (if cinna- 
mon is not liked it can be omitted),, the juice of 12 and 
the peel of 3 lemons, add the whites of 6—8 eggs beaten 
on the stove until watery, and proceed as given under 
No. 1. Serve the jellies in glasses or in moulds, or turn 
them out of the mould, which has first been spread with 
almond oil. For 30— 36 persons. 

Remark.— For 1 bottle of wine take 4 calves' feet ; for Invalids use only 2, 
because the jelly must be milder. All sweet jellies must not" be made too thick,- 
the lighter the better; but they should be thick enough so that they will not 
break when turned out of the mould. __ 

25. Wine Jelly made with Gelatine. Take 1- quart 
of white wine, % pound of sugar, the juice of 2 lemons 
and the yellow rind of half a lemon, put into wine for a 
while to draw, and about an ounce of white or red 
gelatine. 

Soak the gelatine in 1 small cupful of water or wine, 
dissolve the sugar in thewineand put the juice of the 
lemons and the sugar into an enameled vessel with the 
dissolved gelatine, cover and let it come to a boil. 
Then strain it through muslin, put into a dish, s>nd set 
aside in a cool place. This jelly can be turned >ut of 
the dish if wished. 

26. Wine Jelly of Gelatine in Jelly Dishes. Take 
1 quart of white wine, % pound of sugar and the peeled 
rind of a lemon, which should be left in the wine for a 
while. In the Summer take about 1 ounce of gelatine, 
in the Winter a little less. The gelatine is dissolved in 
a cupful of water and strained through muslin into a 
jelly dish. 

Sometimes the wine jelly will not be quite clear and 
transparent, particularly if the gelatine was not quite 



Sweet Clear Jellies. 293 

perfect. In this case it will be best' to only put about 
an inch deep of the jelly into the jelly dish, put the rest 
Of the jelly into a large vessel, 'surround it with ice 
and beat until it is thick and bright. This frosting is 
then put onto the jelly and set aside in the chest until 
wanted. 

27. Wine Jelly. Cook a white wine jelly as directed 
in the above receipt and set aside to cool. Then boil 5 
ounces of washed rice in water until tender, add 1 small 
cupful of white wine, 2% ounces of sugar, a little salt, 
lemon peel and juice, also 2 cakes of dissolved gelatine, 
let the rice boil until the water has all boiled away, and 
then spread on a flat dish to cool. After the wine jelly 
and rice have cooled, put a layer of the jelly into the 
mould, then with a spoon make dumplings of the rice 
and put these on the jelly side by side. Fill these into 
the dish in layers, having-the last layer of wine jelly. 
Turn out of the mould and dot with candied orange 
peel. 

28. Fruit Jelly with Cherry=, Raspberry- or Currant 
Syrup and Gelatine. Dissolve some gelatine in not quite 
1 pint of water, strain through muslin and add enough 
white wine so that with the fruit syrup you will have 
nearly 1 quart. The color must be a pretty red. 2 
heaping tea spoonfuls of sugar will be found to be about 
right, but the sugar should be added according to the 
acidity of the juice; sometimes the sugar can be omit- 
ted. Heat the juice, then pour through muslin into a 
dry mould (~*ee No. 2), and before serving turn out of 
the mould. 

29. Wine Jelly with Eggs, or "Eggs in the Nest". 

% quart of milk; % ounce of gelatine (white), 2 ounces 
of grated sweet almonds, a few bitter ones, vanilla and 
sugar according to taste. 

The gelatine is dissolved in 1 small cupful of water, 
and cooked untildear, then strained through muslin 
and set in a warm place. When this is done, boil % of a 
quart of milk (cream is better) with the almonds, sugar, 
vanilla and pour into a large mould to cool. Then stir 
the eggs in the warm gelatine and pour into the egg 
shells. For this purpose the eggs must be opejiejLat^ 
thelaEge-ead. but the opening should be only large 



294 M.— Jellies and Ices. 

enough to permit emptying the shell without breaking 
it; put the pointed end of the egg into salt. The boiled 
blanc-manger, "WM'dr can be'divided" into three parts 
and colored red with cochineal, brown with chocolate 
and green with spinach juice, is poured into the egg 
shells through a funnel and set aside LU liopl. 

In the-Tirsantime make a jefly"of ITbottle of wine 
{% quart) with 1 ounce of gelatine dissolved in 1 small 
cupful of water, 6 ounces of sugar and the juice of 
2 lemons with the grated peel, pour into a jelly-ring and 
let it cool. When it is to be served turn the jelly into a 
round dish, peel the eggs and put them into the center 
of the ring. 

\ A prettier way is to make a nest of sugared strings,, 
Boil 1 pound of sugar with 1 cupful of water until the 
sugar when dropped into cold water will form into little 
balls. Then put. the sugar syrup into a dish of hot 
water to keep it warm, brush a round mould with 
almond oil and fill the syrup into the form with a fork, 
spinning it out in threads to cover the bottom and 
sides of the mould. When the sugar is cold it can be 
taken out of the form in the shape of a nest. 

Another way is to make a nest of chestnuts for the 
eggs. Boil 1 pound of scalded and peeled chestnuts 
until tender, with the addition of 1 cupful of cream and 
a little vanilla, and strain. Mix the almonds with a 
thick sugar syrup, butter a smooth mould, line it with 
fine paper and press in the chestnut mass evenly about 
% inch thick. After it is cold turn- out of the mould, 
take off the paper, let the nest cool and pour over all a 
chocolate icing. 

30. Ribbon Jelly. Prepare a blanc-manger as in 
the above receipt, also a fruit jelly as in No. 28. Fill 
into a form in layers, letting each layer cool before the 
other is put on. The best way is to put the mould on 
chopped ice and keep the jelly warm on the hearth. 

31. Lemon Jelly. This is made of 1 pint of calves' 
, feet s'tock as given under No. 1, 1 quart of white wine, 

10 ounces of sugar, a little cinnamon, a few cloves, the 
juice of 4 and the peel of 2 lemons, a little saffron about 
the size of a pea, and the whites of 4 eggs prepared as 
directed under No. 25. The jelly is decorated with can- 
died lemon slices. 



Sweet Clear Jellies. 295 

Instead of calves' feet stock, 1 ounce of gelatine can 
be used to prepare this the same as wine jelly. 

32. Punch Jelly. 1 ounce of gelatine is dissolved 
in 1 cupful of water (see No. 1), 1 pound of sugar is 
brought to a boil with the grated rind of a lemon, 
% quart of wine, the juice of 6 lemons and the beaten 
white of an egg, then take the dish from the stove, set 
where it is warm and as" soon as it is clear pour through 
flannel or muslin. Then stir through it 1 pint of rum 
and pour the jelly into a glass dish and set aside to 
cool, or put into any form desired if wanted to turn out 
of the dish. 

33. French Liquor Jelly. 1 ounce of gelatine, %' 
quart' of water, % peund of sugar, 1 lemon, 2—3 small 
glassfuls of arrac. 

Dissolve the gelatine as described under No. 1, mix 
with the water, beat the whites of 2 eggs with the crushed 
shells, pour in the cooled gelatine and beat. Then add 
the sugar and put the mass on the fire. When it begins 
to boil add the juice of a lemon, let it boil for a few 
moments, strain through muslin, then add the arrac, 
rum, or any desired liquor, fill into sauce dishes or 
glasses and set in a cold place. 

34. Jelly of all Kinds of Fruit. Make a wine or 
lemon jelly sweeter than usual, pour into a glass dish, 
and to this add fruit of various kinds: strawberries, 
currants, cherries, raspberries, etc., arrange neatly with- 
out the juice and let the jelly cool. Or sweeten the jelly 
as usual and sugar the fruit for a while before using. 

35. Apple Jelly. 1% pounds of sour apples are 
cooked until tender in 1 pint of water, stirred through 
a sieve, and while still warm mix through the pulp 
1 cupful of white wine in which 1% ounces of gelatine 
have been dissolved. Then put in the peel of half a 
lemon, the juice of 2 lemons, 1 pound of sifted sugar and 
a little arrac. Let the mass, of which there will be 
about 2 quarts, come to a boil, stir constantly and put 
into a form which has been spread with olive oil. The 
jelly is stirred often before it is put into the form, and 
before cold turn out of the form, and serve, if liked, with 
a vanilla sauce. 



296 M— Jellies and Ices. 

36. Orange Baskets filled with Jelly. Cut an orange 
in two smoothly in the center with a sharp knife, take 
out the pulp to the skin with a silver spoon. Then cut 
a strip along both sides of the hollow peel of the orange, 
leaving the strips fast at the ends, bend these strips 
upwards to make a handle like on a basket, and catch 
them in the middle with a dainty piece of ribbon tied in 
a bow. 

In the meantime make a wine jelly with the juice of 
the oranges, fill into the baskets and set aside in a cool 
place on a dish. As these baskets hold but little jelly, 
an extra dish of jelly should be handy so that if any of 
the guests wish for more their baskets can be refilled. 

All plain wine wine or fruit jellies are excellent for 
invalids ; Nos. 29, 32 and 33 are particularly nice. 



III. ICES. 



37. General Directions. The preparation of ices is 
not so difficult an affair as it was a number of years 
ago. A freezer of good construction and easy manipu- 
lation is now within the reach of all at a reasonable 
price. The ice should be broken into small pieces, using 
"plenty of salt, packing the ice and salt firmly around 
the freezer. Rock salt is the best for the purpose, but if 
it is not obtainable common salt will do. 

38. Vanilla Ice. The yolks of 16 fresh eggs, 2% 
quarts of fresh cream, % pound of sugar and vanilla, 
and keep on the stove, constantly stirring, until just 
before it commences to boil. Then pour into a deep 
dish, and stir until no longer warm, so that no crust 
will form.. After it is cold put into the freezer and finish. 

It is best" to bring the cream to a boil in a double 
boiler so as not to scorch it. 

39. Quince Ice. The quinces are peeled and cooked 
in water with a few pieces of cinnamon until tender, 
then pressed through a sieve, mix with sugar and then 
put into a freezer. To every pound Of strained quinces 
take % pound of sugar. 



Ices. 297 

40. Orange Ice. Dissolve % pound of sugar with 1 
cupful of water, the rind of an orange grated on some 
sugar, the juice of 8 oranges and 2 lemons, % bottle 
of Malaga, % ounce of gelatine and 1 cupful of wine. 

41. Punch Ice. 1 quart of water, 1 quart of wine,- 
1 pound of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, the peel of a lemon 

f rated on sugar, the juice of 4 lemons, and the yolks of 
2 eggs. Stir this constantly until it commences to 
boil, then pour quickly into a deep dish. When it is 
freezing pour in gradually 4 cupfuls of arrac. 

42. Raspberry Ice. The juice of 2 pounds of rasp- 
berries, % pound of sugar dissolved in 1 pint of white 
wine, and a few pieces of cinnamon. Mix well together 
and let it freeze. 

43. Frozen Westphalian Pudding. Boil 1 pint of 
milk togetherwith 6 ounces of sugar, flavor with vanilla, 
and stir into it 8 whole or the yolks of 6 eggs with some 
cold milk and mix through the milk on the stove until 
thick. Let it cool, pour through a sieve and freeze.. 
Then gradually stir in % quart of whipped cream, sugar 
according to taste and 1 ounce of brown bread ("pum- 
pernickel"), 2 — 2% ounces of pounded macaroons with a 
few bitter ones, a little Marascino and stir until quite 
thick, fill into a pudding mould which can be covered 
tightly and bury in cracked ice with plenty of salt, and 
set aside in the cellar for 2 — 3 hours. When serving dip 
the mould into hot water, turn the pudding on a dish 
and surround with any kind of small cakes. 

44. Baked Ice. Whip the whites of 6 eggs to a stiff 
froth, mix with it 6 ounces of sugar, and spread half of 
this into a deep porcelain dish. Bake in a warm oven 
to a nice yellow color, and let it cool. Then make a 
vanilla ice as directed in one of the preceding receipts, 
fill into the mould and pour the remaining frosting on 
top of this, sprinkle thickly with powdered sugar, hold 
a hot shovel over the sugar so as to form a crust. 
Decorate the edge of the pudding with preserved fruits 
and serve. 

45. Fruit Ice Pudding. Make a vanilla ice as 
directed in No. 38, put into a round mould, when cool 
put in some fruit — without the juice — cherries, apricots, 



298 M.— Jellies and Ices. 

strawberries, etc., put the fruit inside of the pudding so 
that when it is turned out of the mould it cannot be 
seen, cover the mould "tightly and set in ice. Whipped 
cream with sugar and vanilly is also set in a cool place. 
When it is, to be served di|>the mould into hot water, 
turn out of the n ouki a;id pcu. the cream over it. 

46. Nesselrod Ice Pudding. Carefully peel 1 pound 
of chestnuts, cook in 1 pint of milk un^il tender, mash 
them, mix with % pound of sugar, a little vanilla, the 
yolks of 3 eggs, and 1% quarts of cream. Stir on a slow 
fire until thick, then strain through a hair sieve, whip 
until cold and fill into a freezer. Let the cream freeze 
and then mix in 1 glassful of Marascino, % pound of 
scalded raisins, % pound of currants, 2 ounces of finely 
cut citron, fill into a mould and bury in ice for 2 hours. 
When ready to serve turn out of the mould, and serve 
this pudding with whipped cream as directed for fruit 
pudding. % 

Ices should not be served to invalids unless with the 
physician's consent. 



N— Various Cold Sweet Dishes, 

SUCH AS 

Puddings, Blanc= manges, Whipped Cream, 

Fruit Sauces, and Wine=, Milk- 

and Fruit Ices. 



1. General Directions. Clean utensils are abso- 
lutely essential ; the best kinds are deep enameled or tin 
kettles. 

When finely grated almonds are required they should 
be prepared on an almond grater or pounded in a 
mortar. 

As creams are apt to curdle very easily the follow- 
ing hints should be regarded: They should be whipped 
at the start but as soon as they become warm the beat- 
ing should become more rapid and continue without 
interruption until just before they commence to boil, 
but they should not boil unless plenty of flour has been 
mixed with the eggs. Then put them into a tureen or 
deep porcelain dish and whip for a little while longer 
until cool. 

Before jellies, puddings, etc., are held in hot water 
to loosen them from the mould, press thefingers around 
the edges, by which means you can easily determine 
whether it is necessary to warm the mould. 

The jellies should never be dissolved in milk, but 
always.in water or wine, much less can they be boiled in 
milk without curdling. In order to prevent curdling 
the jellies should be added to the cooled mass, either 
beating or stirring them, the milk should not be boiled 



300 Various Cold Sweet Dishes. 

with wine, the latter may be added cold at last and if 
the mass is not quite cool stir or beat it. If this pre- 
caution is not heeded the creams, etc., will be sure to 
curdle. 

For dishes where the egg yolks are added at last, 
these should be stirred with a little cold water-^a table- 
spoonful to each egg yolk — take the kettle from the Are, 
stir some of the boiling liquid to the egg yolks, grad- 
ually adding more, pour this to the cooked mass, stir- 
ring briskly and proceed as directed. 

To prevent a skin from forming over the cream, stir 
them occasionally until they are cool. Let them stand 
1 — 2 hours before using, then stir them once more and 
fill them into glasses or cream dishes as the case 
may be. 

Before turning creams, etc., out of the moulds, it is 
particularly necessary to let them cool. The mould 
should either be lined with almond oil, or else, when 
directed, rinse in cold water or leave them dry. 

As noted for the preparation of puddings or souffles, 
a pinch of salt should be taken when making creams. 

2. Ornamentation of Creams. Creams can be orna- 
mented with candied fruits cut into very thin slices, red 
or white "kisses", or with dots of cranberry- or black 
currant jelly, or with appropriate flower leaves. Thick 
sweet cream beaten to a stiff froth and mixed with the 
addition of sugar and a dash of arrac, then scooped 
with a teaspoon, makes a very pretty ornament for 
creams. Raspberry-, gooseberry- and other fruit jellies 
can also be user], stirring each heaping tablespoonful 
of the same with 2 tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar

I. DUMPLINGS FOR SOUPS AND FRICASSEES. 



1. Directions for preparing Dumplings. The bread 
for dumplings must not be fresh nor soaked in warm 
water, because, in both cases, the bread will become 
sticky. Lay the bread into cold water for a few mo- 
ments, put it into a cloth, gently press out the water 
and then rub it. "Stale grated wheat bread and rolled 
crackers are also used in dumplings. 

For the finest kinds of dumplings, and also for fish 
dumplings, only the white part of the bread is used, the 
crust being cut off. 

Although in every receipt the quantity is given it is 
always best to try a small dumpling to see if £hey are 
right. If needed, a little bread, butter, egg or Water 
can be added. 

Meat dumplings to be served with fricassee and 
soup are either rolled with the hands, the hands being 
kept mjoist by dipping them into cold water, or, better 
still, they are moulded with a tea- or tablespoon, which 
is dipped into the boiling water after each dumpling is 
formed, put them into the boiling, soup and cook for 
10 — 15 minutes. If many dumplings are to be cooked 
it will be found better to mould and lay them on a dish 
so as to put them all into tho soup at once, otherwise 
those put in first will cook for too long atime. If the 
dumplings are made of flour, potatoes or bread, and 
they are dry on the inside after cooking, they are done. 
Meat dumplings are ready Avhen the meat is done. 
Dumplings for fricassees are not cooked in a thick gravy

spoon in the water, so that the dumplings will not stick 
to it. Boil for about 10 minutes, and serve on a hot 
dish with grated bread fried in either butter or kidney 
suet. For a sauce cook butter, salt and water, and 
thicken with a teaspoonful of cornstarch. 

The dumplings are served alone or with sourkrout. 

46. South Germany Liver Dumplings. , Take 1 
pound of calves' liver and prepare as in the above re- 
ceipt, together with about 6 ounces of wheat bread, 1 
handful of flour, 6 eggs, 2 onions fried in butter, parsley, 
majoram, nutmeg, pepper and salt. The finely cut 
bread is put into 1 pint of boiling milk, then the eggs 
are stirred through it with the seasoning, the pounded 
liver and then the flour is mixed through it thoroughly, 
after which proceed as above directed. 

47. Ham Dumplings with Sourkrout. Take the 
remnants of a ham and boil them after they have lain 
in milk for a day. On the following day, for 6 ounces of 
ham, soak 8 rolls, cut into pieces in some bouillon 
(made of extract of beef), cut the ham into very small 
pieces with half as much pork fat, fry the fat until 
brown with a few sliced Onions, mix fat, onions and 
ham with the pressed wheat bread, some eggs, salt, 
chopped parsley and 4 — 5 spoonfuls of flour, and let the 
dough stand for a few hours before making into large 
dumplings, which are turned in flour and boiled in 
salted water until nearly done. 

Dumplings cannot be served to invalids. 



P. — Compots of Fresh and 
Dried Fruits. 



1. General Directions. All kinds of fruits, fresh as 
well as dried, must be cooked in enameled ware, for 
when they are cooked in iron they receive an unpleasant 
taste. 

Dried fruits must be nicely washed. When wash- 
ing prunes, take warm water, change it a number of 
times, rub well between the hands and then rinse in cold 
water. Fresh plums are rubbed in a vtowel before cook- 
ing, apples and pears are peeled and then washed and 
rinsed. 

Another way is to wash dried fruit once, then leave 
it in water over night and the next day put on the stove 
in water and cook. The compot is much nicer when 
cooked in this way and can be prepared in half of the 
time. 

Fresh juicy fruit, such as raspberries7 currants, 
huckleberries or fresh stoned plums, need only a little 
water, just enough to wet the bottom of the kettle; 
they are cooked in their own juices until done; for dried 
fruits plenty of water must be added, cover, put on the 
stove and cook slowly until done. 

The sauce must be neither too thick nor too thin, 
With dried fruits a little cornstarch can be stirred 
through, them but it must not be any thicker than in 
preserved fruits. 

After cooking the fruit it should be placed on a flat 
dish, pour the juice into the boiling liquor, when serving 
form into a mound shape, leaving the edge of the dish 
untouched, put the best appearing fruit on top, being 



328 P. — Compots of Fresh and Dried Fruits. 

careful never to pierce with a fork. The upper layer of 
fruit should be covered with some of the sauce, and add 
the remaining sauce when the dish is sent to the table. 

In cold seasons never send the fruit to the table icy 
cold, but if it has been cooked the day before, always 
slightly warm it. 

Compots intended for the family table can receive 
an addition of 1 — 2 tablespoonfuls of common sago, 
added when the compot is put on the fire. Pearl soup 
noodles can also be added. 

When compots need a flavoring, lemon- or orange 
peel may be used; prepare the latter as directed in 
A, No. 48. 



I. FRESH FRUIT. 

2. Rhubarb Compot. No. 1. Take off the skin, cut 
into small pieces, wash, put on the stove in cold water 
containing a pinch of bi-carbona,te of soda, tp lessen the 
acidity of the plant, and let it come to a boil; put on a 
sieve and then into the sugar, which can be seasoned 
with white wine and vanilla or with a little lemon peel, 
and cook quickly until done. Thicken the compot with 
a little finely grated bread or else after taking out the 
rhubarb cook the sauce with a little sugar, and then 
pour' it over the rhubarb on which bread toasted in 
butter can be placed. 

3. Rhubarb Compot. No. 2. Put the prepared rhu- 
barb on the fire with water and the necessary sugar, let 
it cook until done, and if necessary thicken the sauce 
with some dissolved cornstarch or finely grated bread ; 
serve cold. 

4. Green Gooseberry Compot. Take gooseberries 
when about half grown, pick and wash clean. Then 
bring some water to a boil with sugar and a few pieces 
of cinnamon or vanilla, put some of the berries into this 
and as soon as done take them out of the syrup with a 
skimmer, doing this carefully as they are easily mashed. 
Put in some more berries and continue until all have 



Fresh Fruit. 329 

been cooked. Then boil the syrup as much as is needed 
and pour over the compot. Another way is to put the 
berries on the fire in cold water, and when nearly boil- 
ing pour off the water and proceed as above; in this 
way a great deal of the acid is taken out of the berries. 
The gooseberries can also be used in sweet dishes by 
taking the juice and whipping it to a cream on the Are 
with 1 glassful of white wine and the yolks of 4 eggs, 
mixing through it the beaten whites of the eggs. Then 
carefully stir the berries into the cream, garnish the 
dish with preserved fruits and serve, if wished with cream 
seasoned with vanilla. 

5. Compot of ripe Gooseberries. After the gooseber- 
ries have been cleaned, put them into boiling water, and 
after a few minutes when they are done put them on 
a colander. Then stir them through the colander and 
put on the fire with sugar and cinnamon or vanilla., stir- 
ring frequently, bring to a boil, and thicken as wished 
with either grated bread or cornstarch, and when cold 
cover with whipped cream before serving. 

6. Compot of Strawberries and Apples. If good 
apples can be obtained during the strawberry season, 

firepare. them as usual, divide into 8 pieces and wash, 
n the meantime bring the water to a boil with sugar 
and wine or lemon juice, add the apples and cook until 
done. Then put in plenty of strawberries with a little 
more sugar, cook for a short time longer and after it 
has been stirred carefully, send the compot to the table. 

7. Wild Strawberries for Dessert. Rinse the berries 
in water 1 hour before wanted, sprinkle plentifully with 
powdered sugar, pour a little water over them, cover 
and set aside. 

8. Cherry Compot. Sour as well as sweet cherries 
may be used. Take off the stems, and stone them. Then 
pound 4—6 cherry pits, cook them for%— % hour in a 
little' water, or water and wine, whole cinnamon and a 
few cloves, pour on a sieve, put the strained juice on the 
fire with the sugar (5 ounces to sour cherries and 2% 
ounces to sweet cherries), and when it boils throw in the 
fruit. Tf the cherries are sweet cook slowly for % hour, 
if they are sour let them simmer a few minutes longer, 



330 P. — Compots of Fresh and Dried Fruits. 

st ring occasionally. After they are done take them 
out of the juice with a skimmer, let the juice cook to a 
syrnp and serve with the cherries. 

9. Currant Compot. Take from the stems but do 
not wash them, sprinkle with sugar, in layers, and do 
not cook longer than until the berries are done, pour- 
ing the juice over the berries, then take them out with 
the skimmer. Cook the syrup for a little while and 
serve cold with the compot. 

10. Raspberry Compot. Pick over the berries and 
slowly and carefully cook them the same as currants, as 
they must be served neatly. 

11. Huckleberry Compot. The berries a re cleaned 
and washed and put on a colander, and after they are 
drained, cook with sugar and cinnamon until done, as 
they lose too much juice when cooked longer. Then 
either lay a roll into the bottom of the dish and pour 
the juice over this, or take the berries but of the dish, let 
the juice cook a little while longer and when serving stir 
through it a spoonful of thick cream or a little dis» 
solved cornstarch. 

12.- English Huckleberry Compot. After the berries 
are washed let them drain on a sieve, put into a stone 
jar, sprinkle in layers with plenty of sugar and cinna- 
mon, cover with a china plate and put the jar into boil- 
ing water and cook uninterruptedly until the berries are 
done. Send to the table without any further addition. 

13. Mulberry Compot. Take wine, sugar and a 
little grated lemon peel, put it on the stove, throw in 
the cleaned mulberries and proceed as in cooking cur- 
rants. 

14. Peach and Apricot Compot. The fruit is peeled, 
stoned, halved and cooked for 5 — 10 minutes with 
sugar, a little white wine and a few of the stones, but 
not too soft. Then lay them into a glass dish, the 
round side to the top,_cook the juice for a few minutes 
and proceed as given under No. 1. 

15. Ha!f=Frozen Peaches. Peel very ripe peaches, 
cut them into halves, sprinkle well with sugar and put 
into a freezer. Keep the freezer i n ice until the peaches 



Fresh Fruit. 331 

are half frozen, then place them on a glass dish in the 
form of a wreath, sprinkle again with sugar and fill 
some whipped cream, seasoned either with vanilla or 
Marascino, into the middle of the dish. 

16. Melon Compot. If the melon is hard and you 
do not wish to serve it in its natural state, a good com- 
pot can be made of it. Peel, cut into long pieces, and 
cook in water, wine, sugar and- plenty of lemon slices 
until done, and serve with the sauce, which must be 
well boiled down. 

17. Pear Compot. Peel the pears, cut off the blos- 
som end and half of the stem, wash, cook in plenty of 
water, a glassful of claret, sugar, cinnamon and a few 
cloves, or else make a sauce of preserved plums or cur- 
rant juice. Put into an enameled pan, cover and leave 
them until of a nice red color and done. Cook the juice 
for a while and pour over the pears, first straining it. 

18. Pears cooked Brown. Peel some good pears, 
cut them in halves, take out the core and lay the pears 
into water. Put a piece of fresh butter into a stewpan 
with some sugar and the pears with only the water that 
remains on the pears. Let them stew slowly. When 
they commence to brown sprinkle a little more sugar 
over them, stew a little while longer until they are done; 
they are nice served with any kind of roast game. 

* 19. Pears with Cranberries. See preserved fruits, 
Division T. 

20. Pears with Plums. Peel the pears, quarter, 
take out the core, wash and cook in an enameled kettle 
with not too much water until they can easily be pierced 
with a fork. Then take the same quantity of plums, 
clean and stone them, lay them on- the pears, let them 
cook until done, mix with the pears (being careful not 
to break the fruit), and serve the compot cold. There 
should not be too much sauce. The plums will give the 
sauce the proper thickness and will replace both sugar 
and seasoning. This compot is nice with dumplings or 
pancakes. Quartered apples can also be put onto the 
pears before the plums. 



332 P. — Compots of Fresh and Dried Fruits. 

21. Common Pear Stew is made the same as apple 
sauce; a few sour, apples can also be cooked with the 
peafs until done. Serve with pancakes. 

» 

22. Plum Compot. Put the plums into a sieve and 
hold them in boiling water for a few moments, then 
take off the skin. After removing the stones put the 
plums on the fire with sugar and cinnamon, cook slowly 
for a little while, but not too soft and serve with the 
juice. The juice can also be mixed with 1 — 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of rum. 

23. Compot of Plums, Pears and Apricots. Take 
ripe plums, pears and apricots, skin and leave them 1 
hour in sugar before serving. This makes an excellent 
compot. 

24. Plum Marmalade. The plums are skinned and 
stoned. Add a few tablespoonfuls of water to them, 
cook, pass through a sieve, add grated bread roasted in 
butter, sugar, cinnamon, lemon or orange peel, bring 
to a boil again and serve. 

25. Blackberry Compot. Pick out all of the large 
berries, pressthe smaller ones and cook the large berries 
in the juice for a few minutes, after adding sugar, -a few 
cloves, cinnamon and lemon slices ; then take them out 
and after the juice has cooked for some time longer pour 
it over the fruit. 

26. Compot of whole Apples. Pare medium-sized 
apples, take out the core with an apple corer, slit length- 
wise and rinse. Then put wine sweetened with sugar 
into an enameled dish, together with a few pieces of cin- 
namon and lemon peel and let it boil. A little straw- 
berry juice makes the compot nicer. Lay in side by 
side as many apples as the dish will hold, and let them 
boil, turn with a spoon and cover, frequently pouring 
over them some of the juice; When the apples are done 
take them out, lay them on a flat dish and cook the 
remaining apples until all are done. Then pour the 
juice which drips off the apples back into the dish and 
boil for some time. In the meantime arrange the fruit 
as directed under No. 1, press half of the juice onto the 
fruit through a. sieve and put on each apple a little 



Fhesh Fictni 333 

apricot marmalade, apple- or currant jelly. Before 
serving the compot, pour over it the remaining cold 
juice of the apples. 

The apples can also be filled after they are cold with 
a mixture of stoned raisins, currants and finely sliced 
citron, and are cooked with sugar and white wine until 
done. A layer of whipped cream mixed with apple mar- 
malade can also be put into the dish, and a layer of the 
fruit over this, decorating with different colored fruit 
jellies. The juice of the apples is used in making fruit 
soup or sauce. 

27. Apple riarmalade. Cook 15 nice apples as for a 
sauce, spice with a, glassful of cherry cordial and a little 
vanilla, then mix through the hot sauce 4 preserved 
pears, 4 preserved apricots, 5 ounces of finely sliced 
candied fruits and 3 ounces of fresh grapes. Get a 
milk bread, hollow it and fill with the sauce. Pour over 
the bread a. chocolate icing, leave it in the oven for a 
few moments, put on the top a. spoonful of peach juice 
and serve. 

Instead of the bread bake a rice cake as directed in 
S, No. 64, cut off the top and hollow out the cake and 
fill as above directed. This cake is not covered with an 
icing, but is dotted with the fruit juices, sprinkled with 
sugar and set in the oven for 5 minutes. 

28. Halved Apples covered with Fruit Jelly. Peel 
the apples, cut them into halves, take out the core, 
wash and cook as directed in No. 26, putting the round 
side into the wine. Then let the apple jelly become fluid, 
cool it on a wet plate and just before serving pour the 
jelly over the apples, which have been put into a glass 
dish, and arrange some preserved fruit around the edge 
of the dish. 

Instead of cooking the apples in wine, they can be 
cooked in water with lemon juice and sugar, or in wine 
and fruit juices half and half (strawberry-, cherry- or 
raspberry juices) until done. 

29. Baked Compot of Apples. The apples are pared, 
cored and cooked in wine and sugar until done. Strain 
through a sieve, mix with apricot marmalade and put 
into a dish. Then beat' the whites of 2 eggs, mix with 
2 tablespoonfuls of sugar and some grated lemon peel, 



334 P.— Compots op Feesh and Dried Fruits. 

brush smoothly over the compot, which is sprinkled 
with sugar and baked to a light yellow color. Serve 
cold with a roast. 

This compot can also be iced with an almond icing 
before baking, by taking a handful of almond's, grate 
and then mix them with sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and 
2 — 3 eggs and spread over the compot. After it has 
cooled decorate it with different colored fruit jelly. 

30. Sliced Apple Compot. To a medium-sized pan- 
ful of apples take % bottle of white wine, 4 — 5 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, some lemon peel and cinnamon and . 
cook the apples slowly in this in a covered dish until 
done. If wished preserved quince or strawberry juice 
may be added to the sauce. 

31. Apple Sauce. The nicer the apples the better 
the sauce will be. Pare and quarter the apples, take 
out the core, wash and cook until done in a little wine, 
or wine, water, sugar, cinnamon (vanilla can be used 
instead of cinnamon) and lemon peel. Then take out 
the spices and stir the apple sauce; the best way is 
to pass the sauce through a "sieve. Smooth the sauce 
nicely on top before serving and after it has cooled 
drop a little fruit jelly or grated chocolate over it. 

32. Apple Salad. (A nice compot of raw apples 
and oranges.) Take good apples, pare and core them, 
cut sweet oranges into thin slices, take out the seeds 
and lay the fruit into a dish alternately with sugar arid 
wine. There should not be any sauce; the last layer 
must be of oranges and sugar. The compot is made 
some hours before wanted for use and is served with 
a roast. 

33. Apples with Anise Seed. Take small apples, 
cut out the blossom, slit the peel from the blossom to 
-the end 3 — 4 times, wash and put them into a jar, with 
1 cupful of water or wine and a piece of butter, a little 
anise seed, cinnamon and lemon peel, cover and let 
them stew, shake a few times and at last put in some 
sugar. 

34. Cooked Sweet Apples. After the apples are 
peeled, quartered and cored, put them on the fire with 
water, anise 'seed, a little butter and % — 1 cupful of 



Fresh Fruit. 335 

vinegar (plenty of lemon juice is better) and cook until 
tender. The vinegar will cause the apples to become 
tender sooner. 

35. Apples with Rice. Take apples of medium size, 
pare and core them and put them into water which has 
been seasoned with a little lemon juice. Then boil the 
apples in 1 quart of water with 1 pound of sugar and 
the rind of a lemon; when done take out of the juice 
with a large spoon. Scald 1 pound of rice and boil it in 
water with 1 pint of white wine, lemon juice and lemon 
peel until thick, and tender, but the kernels must remain 
whole; mix the broth of the apples with a small glass- 
ful of arrac and the necessary sugar, and put into a 
dish. After the rice has cooled, put it into an appro- 
priate dish, heap the apples in the center, fill some pre- 
served fruits into the core, and pour over all the remain- 
ing juice of the apples. If you have no rice mould, form 
the rice wreath around the dish with a tablespoon. 

36. Carrot Compot with a Roast. Peel the cleaned 
carrots with a small knife, so .that they will curl (the 
hard core is removed), cook with the peel of 1 lemon 
until done, and pour on a sieve. Then for 1% pounds of 
carrots cook % pound of sugar, the juice of 2 lemons 
and a little vinegar, let the carrots boil for a few mo- 
ments and then take them out, cook the sauce for a 
little while and pour it over them. 

" 37. Compot of Quinces. Peel the fruit, halve, take 
out the core and cook the fruit in water with sugar and 
whole cinnamon until done: Then pour in 1 glassful 
of wine, put the quinces intd a dish, let the sauce cook 
for some time and pour it over the quinces through a 
strainer. 

The core will make the sauce thicker and the seeds 
will produce a nice red color. 

38. Mixed Compot. 10—12 apples are pared, halved 
and stewed until tender as directed in No. 28. Peel 
3 oranges, slice them, take out the seeds, and sugar for 
a few hours. Some time before this s\ew about 2 ounces 
of plums and let them cool. Arrange the cooked fruits 
neatly in a dish, mixing together orange slices, pre- 
served cherries, apricots and sweet-sour beans, and pour 



336 P.— Compots of Fresh and Dried Fruits. 

over the compot the apple juice which has been boiled 
down with a few spoonfuls of preserved fruit until thick. 

39. Currants and other Fruits as Dessert. Select 
nice grapes, currants, strawberries, cherries, dip each 
berry into whipped whites of eggs and then in powdered 
sugar and lay on a sieve to dry. When the fruit is dry 
it will have a frosted appearance, and look very pretty 
when mixed with fresh unsugared fruit. 

40. Peaches for Dessert. Peel ripe peaches and for 
15 peaches cook % pound of sugar and a little water to 
a thick sugar syrup and lay each peach into this syrup 
for 2 minutes. After all the fruit is sugared, which must 
be. done with a very moderate fire, put it into a glass 
dish, mix the syrup with 3 tablespoonfuls of Marascino 
and pour it over the fruit. Put the fruit on the ice for 
4 hours before serving and it will be found very 
delicious. ~- _ ._ 

41. Pineapple Compot for the Sick. Take a pine- 
apple, cut it into slices of uniform size, and boil the 
juice of the fruit with sugar and lemon peel until thick. 
Stew the pieces of pineapple in this for some minutes, 
lay into a dish, pour the syrup of the fruit over this and 
decorate with strawberries. 

All compots maybe given to the sick excepting Nos. 
18,21,33,34,36,38.

Q. — Salads and Lettuces. 



1. In General. Lettuces of every description must 
be carefully examined before preparing, for slugs and 
insects are quite apt to be concealed in, the leaves, and 
all of the latter that are withered or otherwise unfit for 
use can, at the same time, be removed, but it is a mis- 
take to take away the ribs from closed bunches of let- 
tuce, because they are deemed the best part thereof. 
After removing the outer leaves divide the remainder of 
the bunch into about three parts and cut the closed 
Inside part into small pieces. When the lettuce is not Qf 
good quality, however, the stems or ribs must also be 
removed, because they are tough. In the opinion of 
many cooks, lettuce is improved by keeping it in the cel- 
lar for about 2 hours after taking it out of the garden. 

Lettuce should not lay in water unless it has become 
withered, Kinse in a deep pan in plenty of cold water 
before preparing; this will cause all sandy particles to 
drop to the bottom of the pan ; hold the bunches in the 
hand loosely and raise and lower them in the pan of 
water until clean. Then twirl in a sieve until all of the 
water has been removed. To press the lettuce with the 
' hands is apt to crush and bruise it, thereby impairing 
its fresh appearance. 

The addition to lettuce ofcertkin herbs, such as 
tarragon, onion tops, peppergrass or cresses, burnet, 
etc., imparts to it an agreeable flavor. When otaion 
tops are not in season, finely sliced onions are indis- 
pensable with some varieties of lettuce; inasmuch, how- 
ever, as the flavor of onions is disliked by some, they 
may be cut into fine slices- and served separately in 
vinegar. 

Salt should be added to lettuce with, great caution, 
because it is easily oversalted. Good olive oil should 



Q.*— Salads and Lettuces. <339 

always be used. Hints on keeping salad oils in good 
condition will be found under General Directions in the 
forepart of this book. For a salad sauce in which the 
yolks of hard boiled eggs are used, the yolks should 
first be rubbed as finely as possible, then stir in some 
vinegar and finally add the oil gradually; the sauce 
when prepared in this manner will bind more readily ; 
then mix it under constant stirring to the other ingred- 
ients. Good vinegar is essential for the preparation of 
a good salad, and care should always be observed not 
to obtain an adulterated article. 

An excellent substitute for the yolks of eggs for 
sauces for lettuce, endives, etc., consists of 2 boiled po- 
tatoes, rubbed while still warm until very smooth. 
Then stir to a well bound sauce with vinegar, milk, olive 
oil, salt and such lettuce herbs as desired- 

Many cooks add sugar to lettuce; as directions for 
the addition of sugar may be omitted in some of the 
following receipts, it may be well to say here that it can 
readily be added ; instead of using the cream directed 
to be added to many of the salads, a rather plentiful 
addition of olive oil is then in order. . 

The sauces should be added to lettuce shortly before 
serving, because the latter, Avhen in. the sauce for too 
long a time, becomes tough and loses its fresh appear- 
ance. To make the lettuce milder, first mix the oil 
through it gently, and then the sauce. Horn or wooden 
salad spoons or forks are the best for this purpose, and 
the mixing should be done rapidly and carefully, so as 
not to mash or bruise the lettuce. Meat-, fish- and 
herring salads gain in palatableness when mixed a few 
hours, if possible a whole day, before serving. Meat 
salads absorb a large quantity of juices, and neither 
vinegar nor water should be added to them plentifully ; 
the latter should be mixed with extract of beef, which 
will improve the flavor of the salad. 

2. Chicken Salad. For 24—30 persons. Boil 6 
young chickens with plenty of butter and salt' until 
done but not too tender. Cut up when cold ; the bones 
are taken out of the breast and legs, and the meat used 
,for the salad. The back, wings and neck are cooked 
with a small piece of veal, add a little browned' flour 
and, after cooking for % hour, strain the broth. Mix 



340 Q. — Salads and Lettuces. 

the yolks of 4 eggs with somn nutmeg, % glassful of 
white wine, salt and a little white pepper and stir in the 
boiling broth which is then poured over the meat. 
Take nice crisp lettuce and cut it into 4 pieces, or else 
take tender endives, and mix with the following sauce: 
The yolks of 6 hard boiled and 2 raw eggs are rubbed 
together, add a little vinegar, a few spoonfuls of salad 
oil, stir well together, also finely chopped tarragon or 
tarragon vinegar, or better still some extract, 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of sugar, 1 teaspoonful of mustard and the 
broth which was left from the chicken. This salad is 
put into the dish with the meat in the form of a star. 

If remnants of poultry are used, cut them into 
cubes, mix with finely cut hard boiled eggs, boiled white 
beans and small onions, mix with a mayonnaise sauce 
and garnish with the hearts of lettuce. 

3. Turkey Salad. If the whole turkey is to be used, 
follow the directions given in No. 2, and garnish with 
crabtails. In making a salad of remnants of turkey, 
cut the meat into little pieces. In the meantime boil a 
few celery roots until done, halve and then cut them 
into 3 — 4 pieces. Cut good Summer sausage into pieces, 
make a sauce as in the above receipt and into it care- 
fully mix the meat, celery, «ausage and sliced pickles; 
serve neatly. Slice some red beets and lay them around 
the salad in the shape of a wreath, cut some hard boiled 
eggs lengthwise into 8 pieces and lay them in with the 
beet slices with the rounded side to the top. 

4. Fish Salad. For a dinner with several courses 
the following salad is very nice. For 20 persons take 
1 pound of eel, 1 pound of pike, % pound of trout, 
% pound of turbot, % pound of soles, % pound of salmon 
and 5 lampreys. Boil the fish in salted water the day 
previous with peppercorns and the juice and rind of a 
lemon. The eel is cooked first because it requires less 
salt, then it is taken out of the broth and the pike is 

^cooked, which will need a little more salt, then the trout, 
soles, turbot ose after theother, with the necessary salt. 
The salmon is cooked in separate water with salt. After 
the broth, in which the other fish were cooked has be- 
come cold, keep the fish in it until the next day. Fish 
must not remain in the broth while it is cooling, as it 
gives them an unpleasant flavor. 



Q.— Salads and Lettuces. 341 

When making the salad, after boning the fish, cut it 
into small pieces, cut the lamprey crosswise into pieces 
about 1 inch in length, serve with % cupful of capers to 
which may be added 30—40 oysters and 20 crabtails, 
either whole'or cut into pieces. 

The following sauce is poured over the fish :. 3 hard 
boiled eggs and 1 raw egg are rubbed together with 1 
cupful of strong meat bouillon, about 4 tablespoonfuls 
of salad oil, 2 teaspoonf uls , of mustard, 1 teaspoonful 
of sugar, a little white pepper, 1 tablespoonful of thick 
cream, vinegar and a little salt, all stirred together. 

5. Pike Salad. Medium -sized pike are emptied, 
washed, cleaned and cOoked in salted water with plenty 
of onions until done. Take from the stove and leave 
them in the water for 10 minutes as the fish will be 
salted better in this way. Then put the pike on a dish 
to cool, take out the bones, skin and divide into pieces. 
In the meantime cook large crabs in salted water with 
a little vinegar. The vinegar will give the crabs a 
prettier red color. Then take the meat out of the crabs. 
In the meantime boil a few eggs until hard, rub the 
yolks and stir with vinegar, (the yolks will not bind as 
well in oil), mix with finely chopped eschalots and 
chopped anchovies, briskly stirring in vinegar, olive oil 
and a little pike broth, pass the sauce through a sieve 
and stir in a little mustard and chopped parsley. After 
the anchovies have been prepared as for bread and 
butter, cut some lemons into thin slices, lay the pike 
into a deep dish, mix with the meat of the crabs, pour 
over it the sauce, put over this the capers and garnish 
the dish as follows : Around the edge put the crabtails 
with the points turned to the outside of the d : .Ii, put 
the anchovies over the fish crosswise or in the form of 
a star, between these the lemon slices, put a*quartered 
lemon around the edge and at last the cut crab claws 
between the tails. 

6. Lobster Salad with Caviar. The lobster is boiled 
as directed in Division F, the meat taken out of the 
shells, cut into long pieces and laid into a salad bowl. 
Pdur over it a sauce made of the yolks of hard boiled 
eggs, pepper, salt, olive oil, vinegar, white wine, finely 
chopped tarragon, parsley and a few eschalots. The 
salad is garnished with anchovies, capers, hard boiled 



342 Q.— Salads and Lettuces. 

eggs, each egg cut into 8 pieces and the edge of the dish 
surrounded with bits of bread spread with caviar. Some 
prefer the lobster without the bread; others like it 
simply with pepper, oil and vinegar. Salt is usually not 
necessary. 

7. Anchovy Salad. The anchovies are freshened 
and torn through the middle, so that the bones may 
easily be taken out. Put them into a salad bowl with 
capers, small pickles, preserved sour plums, Summer 
sausage cut into slices, and pickled eel which is divided 
lengthwise and cut into pieces the thickness of a finger. 
The dish maybe garnished with lemon slices; pour over 
it a sauce as directed in the above receipt or else 
vinegar, oil, pepper, salt and the grated yolks of a few 
hard boiled eggs. Some prefer the salad with olives, 
roast veal, button onions, mustard, pickles and a few 
apples, all cut into small pieces, and put into a marin- 
ade of bouillon, sugar, vinegar, onions, pepper and salt 
for a few hours before mixing with the salad. 

8. Shrimp Salad. As soon as caught shrimps are 
boiled and shipped. They are taken out of their skins 
and eaten with bread and butter, or else served as a 
salad, putting the shrimps into the center of the dish, 
surrounded with the whites of hard boiled eggs, capers, 

*on this the grated yolks of eggs, then surrounded again 
with hearts of lettuce or water cresses dipped in a 
mayonnaise dressing and then with boiled beets, sliced 
and put into hot vinegar. An a la Diable or mayon- 
naise sauce is served with the salad. A simpler way 
is to serve it with vinegar, oil, pepper, grated, onions 
and hard boiled eggs ; vinegar must not be poured over 
the shrimps, as it will tend to harden them. 

Shrimps are also used to garnish fish dishes and for 
lunches. 

9. Fish and Vegetable Salad. All kinds of vege- 
tables in their season, such as asparagus, cauliflowers, 
cut into small pieces, small salad beans, savoy cabbage 
cut into pieces, young carrots, celery and parsley roots, 
etc., are boiled in salted water, and after they are cool 
put them into a dish with the fish, such as pike, eel, also 
crabtails, garnish with pickled beets cut lengthwise, and 
pour over them a sauce,made as directed under No. 4. 



Q. — Salads and Lettuces. 343 

10. Herring Salad. A dozen herring will make 
enough salad for 24 persons. The herring are emptied, 
washed and freshened in milk over night, and if very 
salty for a longer time. Then take on the skin, bone 
them and cut into small pieces, Take potatoes boiled 
iu their jackets, peel and cool them together with plenty 
of veal roast, pickles, beets, some sour apples, 8 — 12 
hard boiled eggs, leaving 4 to garnish the dish, a celery 
root cooked until tender, % pound of boiled ham,and a 
few onions, all cut into, very small pieces. Then mix 
this with a well-stirred, plentiful sauce made of olive oil, 
wine vinegar, claret, dissolved extract of beef, pepper 
and a trifle of mustard. The milts of 3—4 herrings can 
be used by mixing them with vinegar and passing them 
through a sieve. In case the salad is prepared the day 
before wanted for use, which will make it better, leave it 
over night in a porcelain dish, stir it before using and 
then garnish the dish in the following manner: Take 
pickles or parsley, beets, the yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs, 
and also the whites, each chopped separately. Smooth 
the top of the salad, make a figure with the back of a 
knife — a star for instance — and in the points put a tea- 
spoonful of the minced ingredients, a different color in 
each point, hold the knife in the left hand and place 
it over the line so as not to have the figure uneven. 
Around this make a wreath of any color; if white or 
yellow is chosen, leaves of curly parsley are very pretty; 
freshened, divided and rolled anchovies and capers can 
also be used for ornamenting the salad. As a great 
deal of time is taken in cutting the ingredients of the 
salad separately they may be chopped, but each must 
be chopped separately, and not too fine or the salad 
Will become pulpy. 

11. Herring Salad with Bread and Butter. All the 

ingredients as given in the above receipt, excepting the 
potatoes and beets, are chopped fine and mixed with 
oil, vinegar, pepper, and, if necessary, a little salt ; serve 
neatly, garnishing with capers. 

12. Meat Salad. For' 12 persons. 5—6 lampreys, 
% pound of anchovies, 3 — 4 freshened herring, celery, 
beets, mustard pickles, potatoes and veal roast, taking 
of each % soupplateful, and pf the veal roast 1 soup- 



b44 Q.— Salads and Lettxices. 

plateful, 8—10 preserved sour plums, all cut into long 
pieces and put into the dish in layers. For the sauce 
take 8 hard boiled eggs, pass them through a sieve, 
also 1 small cupful of oil, then 4 teaspoonfuls of must- 
ard, 2 — 3 teaspoonfuls of sugar, 2 — 3 grated onions 
and a little salt. Pour into this enough vinegar, or if 
wished, a little claret or bouillon, to make a thick sauce 
and spread it over the salad. 

13. Soup Meat Salad. About 1 hour before wanted 
cut the meat into pieces and' mix with a good horse- 
radish sauce (see Division E). Take the nicest pieces of 
the meat, dip into the sauce and put them on top of 
the salad. Cucumbers cut into slices are very nice with 
soup meat salad, als*> the finely cut whites of the eggs 
used for the sauce. This salad is served with lettuce or 
with potato dishes of all kinds, and is also nice for 
supper. 

14. Polish Salad. Cold roast of any kind can be 
used. Cut the meat into small pieces, adding some let- 
tuce or endives, and mix with it salad oil, vinegar, 
mustard, pepper, salt, finely cut onions and soft boiled 



Remark . — All lorers of salads wilfnnd this one to be very nice and refreshing. 

15. Truffle Salad. The fresh truffles are not peeled, 
but washed with a brush first in warm, then in cold 
water, then slice like cucumbers and instead of vinegar 
use lemon juice, oil, pepper, salt and mustard. 

Sometimes the truffles are mixed with potatoes. 
When using potatoes stew the truffles in bouillon and 
oil until tender, take them out of the broth and heat 
some boiled peeled potatoes in this broth, mix with 
salt and pepper and cover them. Then peel the truffles, 
cut them into slices and mix with the potatoes; pour 
over them some vinegar, lemon juice, white wine, a little 
dissolved extract of beef and let the salad stand for 
about 3 hours before serving. A dozen pickled oysters 
may also be added to this dish. 

16. Tomato Salad. Put 6—8 tomatoes where they 
will become cold so that they will harden and can more 
readily be cut into slices. Just before serving slice them, 
taking out as many of the seeds as possible. Then 
make a dressing of 4 spoonfuls of salad oil, salt, pepper, 



Q.— Salads and Lettuces. 345 

a little sugar, if liked a few teaspoonfuls of chopped 
onions, add 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, pour over the 
salad and serve. 

17. nixed Salad. Take beets, pickles, celery roots 
cooked until tender, and potatoes boiled in their 
jackets, in equal parts; slice and pour over them the 
following sauce : Hard boiled eggs stirred with vinegar, 
salt, mustard, a little sugar, oil, and thick sour cream, 
taking for each egg 1 tablespoonful of cream. As the 
beets and pickles are sour, be careful not to put in too 
much vinegar. 

18. Mushroom and Potato Salad (Flanders Salad). 

Nice potatoes are boiled in their jackets, peeled, cutinto 
slices, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and a few spoon- 
fuls of oil and bouillon poured over them. Slice medium 
soft boiled eggs and some mushrooms stewed in butter 
and bouillon, and mix with the potatoes. The whites 
of 2 eggs, an eschalot and a sour apple are chopped 
fine and the yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs put through a 
sieve; mix all with 4 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 1 tea- 
spoonful of mustard, a little sugar and 4 spoonfuls of 
vinegar, stir to a thick sauce, and mix throtigh the 
sliced potatoes and mushrooms. Set the salad aside 
for a few hours, and then send to the table garnished 
with endives, dressed with oil, vinegar, salt and a little, 
sugar. 

19. Potato Salad. Boil potatoes of uniform size in 
their jackets in salted water until tender, peel, cut into 
slices and pour 1 cupful of boiling water over them, 
cover and set aside until the dressing is made. Slice a 
tender boiled celery root. For a dressing for 6 persons 
take 6 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, the same amount of 
claret or a bouillon made of extract of beef, 4—6 spoon- 
fuls of vinegar (if very strong dilute it), plenty of pepper 
and salt and if liked a little mustard and finely chopped 
onions. By putting into a dish a layer of potatoes 
then a spoonful of dressing, then potatoes and so on, 
the potato slices will remain whole. Dip potato slices 
of equal size into the dressing and put them over the 
top of the salad. 

Another way is to peel the potatoes, slice and pour 
over them the dressing of oil, salt, pepper, grated onion 



346 Q. — Salads and Lettuces. 

and a little sugar. Then mix some good vinegar with 
a few spoonfuls of boiling bouillon or hot claret, white 
wine or else only seething hot water, whichever is pre- 
ferred, and with this carefully stir the sliced potatoes. 
If liked a little tarragon or finely chopped chives can be 
added ; set the salad aside for a while before bringing it 
to the table. 

Excepting lettuce, any kind of greens can be served 
with potato salad. When mixed with the salad, the 
lettuce wilts too easily. Serve with veal or pork brawn, 
or veal in jelly and with warm and cold roast. 

20. Potato Salad. No. 2. Cut boiled potatoes into 
slices, keep them warm and mix through them the fol- 
lowing dressing : Stir together oil, vinegar, milk, pepper, 
salt and finely cut onions. Put the sliced potatoes into 
a dish, pour over them half of the sauce, put a dish on 
this and shake the salad; then pour over it the remain- 
ing sauce and shake again so that the potatoes will 
be juicy. Goose oil can also be used instead of the 
salad oil. 

21. Potato Salad with Bacon. Fry a saucerful of 
bacon cut into small pieces ; after it has fried take out 
the pieces and fry in the fat some finely cut onions to- 
gether with the necessary vinegar, salt and a little 
pepper, stir through it a few spoonfuls of sour cream or 
water, cut the potatoes into the warm broth, turn them 
in this and serve the salad. 

22. Water Cresses. Water cresses make a very 
healthful salad, and are used as long as their leaves are 
tender. Cut off the stems, wash thoroughly without 
crushing and rinse them on a colander. Then mix with 
olive oil, vinegar and salt, and send to the table imme- 
diately before they wilt. Serve with or without potato 
salad with roast meats, especially with roast pheasant. 

23. Salad of Garden Cresses. These cresses can be 
had all the year. Cut off all of the leaves that are 
tender, wash thoroughly and serve with oil, vinegar and 
a little salt 

A dressing of oil, vinegar, finely grated yolks oi 
eggs, mustard and sugar is also well liked. 



Q.— Salads and Lettuces. - 347 

24. Asparagus Salad. The asparagus is cleaned as 
directed under Vegetables (C, No. 16) ; tie into bunches 
and cook in boiling salted water until tender and then 
put it on a colander to drain. After it is cool cut the 
threads, lay the asparagus neatly into a salad dish and 
pour over it oil and vinegar in equal parts mixed with 
salt and pepper. The asparagus can also be cut into 
pieces and cooked in salted water until tender. 

25. Lettuce. Directions for cleaning, washing, rins- 
ing and mixing lettuce are given under No. 1. For a 
dressing according to the French method, for 6 persons 
take the yolks of 2 — 3 hard boiled eggs, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of salad oil, a little salt and vinegar and, if liked, a 
little mustard and pepper, also some finely chopped 
tarragon, a few young onions, etc.; to this can be added 
2 spoonfuls of thick sour cream, taking the yolk of an 
egg and 1 tablespoonful of salad oil less. 

In North Germany they take sour cream and sugar 
and mix them with the salad, or a little vinegar is 
mixed with the cream. The sauce can also be made in 
the following manner: 1 cupful of thick sour cream is 
stirred with 2 spoonfuls of vinegar, salt, sugar, chopped 
tarragon and the yolks of 3 raw eggs, pour this dress- 
ing over the lettuce just before serving, first moistening 
it with salad oil. 

A mixed salad of lettuce and sliced beans cooked 
until tender is also nice; % hour before serving, mix 
through it a dressing made according to one of the 
foregoing receipts. Finely sliced cucumbers can also be 
used, in which case take only oil, sugar, vinegar and 
salt. When served with ham for the supper table mix 
with sliced, hard boiled eggs. 

26. Cauliflower Salad. The cauliflowers are pre- 
pared the same as usual, and then cooked in salted 
water until tender. Drain on a colander and arrange 
in the dish so as to have the heads to the top, pour 
over them a dressing made of a few hard boiled eggs, 
vinegar, oil, pepper and salt. 

27. Cucumber Salad. When peeling cucumbers be 
careful to cut off all of the bitter end. Often they 
are bitter all the way through and then must not be 
used. Slice, pour a little salad oil over them and just 



348 Q.— Salads and Lettuces. 

before serving pour over the salad a dressing made as 
follows: Hard boiled eggs or thick sour cream are 
stirred together with vinegar, pepper, salt, chopped 
parsley and tarragon. Onions may also be added or 
can be served separately with vinegar. Some people 
prefer to wilt the cucumbers by first sprinkling salt over 
them and setting them aside for a short time and then 
pressing. This does not only take away their nice taste, 
but makes them tough and harder to digest. The 
salad can also be mixed with sliced potatoes with a 
dressing of oil, vinegar, sour cream, salt, pepper, tarra- 
gon and sliced onions. For persons with impaired 
digestion who cannot eat fresh cucumbers, peel the 
cucumbers, boil them for a few minutes in salted water 
,and then prepare the same as fresh cucumbers. 

28. Bean Salad. After the beans have been cleaned, 
cook in boiling salted water until tender, then mix with 
onions, oil, vinegar, pepper and salt. Bean salad can 
also be mixed with sliced cucumbers; when doing this it 
is well to first cook the cucumbers for a few moments. 
Lettuce can also be mixed with bean salad. 

29. Red Mixed Salad. Take potatoes boiled in their 
jackets, and to 1 part of potatoes take 1 part of sliced 
beets and a little more of finely sliced red cabbage than 
of beets. Carefully mix through it some oil, vinegar, 
the broth of the beets, pepper and salt, and serve with 
warm roast. 

i 30. Red Salad. Red early cabbage is finely shred- 
ded, pour over it plenty of oil, then mix with vinegar, 
salt and pepper. Serve with meat and hot potatoes. 

31. White Cabbage. Shred the cabbage very fine, 
scald and press it, mix with it oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, 
or a good cooked sour cream sauce, or else with a warm 
bacon sauce with pepper and salt and serve with warm 
potates. 

Remark.— This cabbage is good for salads only in the Fall, for later it 
becomes tough. Salad made of white and red cabbage put into the dish in layers 
is very attractive and nice. 

32. Mixed Winter Salad. 3 parts of potatoes boiled 
in their jackets, 1 part of sour apples, 1 part of red 
beets, 1 part of pickles, all sliced; mix carefully with 



Q.— Salads and Lettuces. 349 

a sauced made of plenty of oil and some sour cream, 
or a sauce of milk, vinegar, pepper and salt so that the 
slices will remain whole. Put around it a border of 
lettuce mixed with oil, vinegar and salt and garnished 
with eggs that are not boiled too hard, each egg cut 
into 8 pieces. Serve with warm roast or cold meat and 
herring. 

33. Endive Salad. When using the curled endives 
take only the yellow leaves and cut off the stems; the 
smooth endives are cut with the stem. The endives are 
washed shortly before making the salad, and mixed 
with oil, vinegar and salt, or, as directed in No. 1, with 
mashed potatoes, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, or else 
serve it with a warm sour cream sauce and potatoes. 

34. Celery Salad. The celery roots are washed and 
cooked in salted water until tender ; peel, take out the 
hard parts and cut into slices and pour over them oil, 
vinegar, pepper and salt; the dish is garnished with 
celery leaves. Celery salad will keep for several days. 

35. Swiss Salad. 1 part of beets, 1 part of celery 
roots cooked in salted water until tender (both cut into 
slices), 1—2 parts of endives or garden cresses are mixed 
with a dressing of oil, vinegar, pepper and salt. 

36. Salad of Pickled Cucumbers. Salt or large- 
vinegar pickles are finely sliced ; put over them plenty 
of oil and if the pickles are not very sour add a little 
vinegar. This salad is very nice with soup meat or 
roast and also with potato salad. 

37. Salad of Salted Salad Beans. Pour boiling 
water over the beans, leave the beans in this for a little 
while and then pour over them a dressing of salad oil, 
pepper and salt. A bacon or warm cream sauce can 
also be served with it. 

38. Russian Salad with Beef. Good sourkrout 
made of Summer cabbage — krout made of Winter cab- 
bage is too tough — is taken out of the cask, put into a 
cloth, pressed and cut; then pour over it oil and pepper. 

Salads of all kinds must never be served to invalids. 



R. — Sauces. 

1. Hot and Cold Sauces for Fish, Meat, 
Vegetables and Pickles. 



A. HOT SAUCES. 

1. General Directions. Sauces should not be con- 
sidered as of secondary importance, on the contrary 
they should always receive particular attention. 

It is impossible to give exact directions regarding 
the right proportion or quantities of sauce to be pre- 
pared for the several dishes; good judgment must be 
your guide in this particular, but a few hints will be 
found useful. 

For the lighter colored strong sauces or gravies the 
flour should be, rubbed in hot butter until it curls, rises 
and turns yellow; for brown sauces it is stirred in the 
butter until it is* of a good brown color (see Division A, 
No. 4); bouillon or water must be hot when added and 
then let the flour cook as long as possible to make the 
gravy clear and remove the flour taste entirely. Jelly- 
like bouillon is well adapted for preparing sauces of all 
kinds. Gravies must always be smooth, never lumpy, 
and by no means resemble a porridge, and be seasoned 
exactly right, that is, neither too much nor too little 
salt and vinegar must.be used. 

All gravies should possess an agreeable flavor of 
salt, spices or herbs, but none of these should be too 
prominent. For this reason English (Worcestershire) 
sauce, which is used to give sauces and ragouts a spicy 
flavor, should be added, a "teaspoonful at a time only; 



Hot Sauces foe Fish, Meats, Etc. 351 

using too much will spoil the gravy, while when added 
in proper quantity it greatly improves it. When nut- 
meg or cloves are used in light sauces be careful to re- 
move the heads, which will discolor the sauce: Cloves 
should be added very sparingly anyway. 

Strength is 'the great desideratum in gravies, and 
when it is lacking or when a strong gravy must be made 
in haste, extract of beef is of inestimable value. It 
obviates the costly and time-consuming preparation of 
coulis, and the addition of %, or % teaspoonful of the 
extract to a finished gravy is all that is necessary to 
give it plenty of strength. 

Sauces made with butter will be smoother and 
milder if cold butter is stirred through the finished 
gravy. If the yolks of eggs are to be stirred into the 
gravy, then this should be done just before serving, 
otherwise, if done on the fire, they will curdle. To pre- 
vent curdling altogether stir a pinch of flour with a 
tablespoonful of water to each egg yolk, gradually add 
under constant stirring some of the gravy, and then 
pour this into the boiling sauce, stirring- it "thoroughly. 

Inasmuch as anchovies are frequently used in cook- 
ing, and a single stale anchovy will spoil the best dishes 
or gravies, it should be observed that anchovies of a 
yellow hue that have become dry and always have a 
rancid taste, must be rejected. They must furthermore 
be freshened until the water remains clear. After 
boning, again rinsing and chopping them, they must be 
cooked in the sauce for the shortest possible time to 
prove of value as a seasoning only. 

2. Clear fleat Broth (Coulis). This broth is used for 
a good brown gravy. Take about % pound of raw veal, 
a small piece of raw ham, a few eschalots, or 1 onion, 
1 celei-y root, 1 parsley root, 1 carrot, 1 bay leaf, cloves 
and peppercorns. The meat and ham are cut into small 
pieces, coarsely pound the spices and all of this is put 
on the firewith % pound of butter, stirring occasionally; 
it will be white for a time and then turn brown. When 
making a white broth put in some flour when the broth 
has turned yellow, let it turn yellow j then, at once pour 
in some boiling bouillon. 

When making a brown coulis brown the above in- 
gredients, then put in the. flour, stirring constantly • 



352 , E.— Sauces. 

until all has browned, add bouillon and brown broth or 
mushrooms, soup herbs, such as tarragon, sweet basil, 
etc., let it cook for at least 1 hour and then strain it. 
The broth must be very thick because it must be thinned 
when using. It will keep in the Winter for 2—3 weeks 
when left uncovered in a cool place and cooked once 
again in the meantime. 

3. Brown Sauce. Brown a finely chopped onion in 
some butter with flour, browning the butter before 
putting in the flour and onion, add 1 carrot, % of a 
parsley root, tarragon, peppercorns and 1 bay leaf; 
after it has stewed for a short time add some boiling 
water and cook for 1 hour, strain, bring to aboilagain, 
add as much extract of beef and a little salt as will 
make a strong sauce, and season with a little lemon 
juice. Capers, finely chopped anchovies or mushrooms 
can also be added. The last named must be very tender. 

4. White Sauce is made as directed in the above 
receipt, using white instead of browned flour. 

5. Truffle Sauce. Make a sauce as directed in 
receipt No. 4, adding nicely cleaned and cooked truffles 
cut into slices. A mushroom sauce can also be prepared 
according to receipt No. 3 or 4. 

6. Robert Sauce. Fry 2 finely chopped onions in 
butter until brown, cook with white "broth No. 2 or 
brown sauce No. 3, and make the necessary quantity of 
sauce, taking 1 pint of white wine, and just before serv- 
ing add 2 tablespoonfuls of mustard. If the sauce is to 
be served with fish, mix with it at last a piece of butter. 

7. Bearnease Sauce. Cook 1 tablespoonful of finely 
chopped eschalots or onions with 4 tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, a few peppercorns, % bay leaf and a little estra- 
gon. When the vinegar is about half boiled away, pour 
it through a sieve, then stir the yolks of 4 eggs with 
1 small cupful of strong bouillon made of extract of 
beef, put this into a pan containing bojling water (or 
into a double kettle), add % pound of butter in small

sauce must be well stirred so that the oil will not be 
noticeable. By adding a little anchovy butter, the 
sauce will be much improved. 



2. Wine, Milk and Fruit Sauces. 

71. White Wine Sauce. Stir 1 heaping teaspoon- 
ful of flour with the yolks of 4 eggs and 1 pint of white 
wine ; take 3 tablespoonf uls of sugar, lemon peel and a 
little cinnamon, stir all together and let it come almost 
to a boil, stirring constantly, then pour into another 
vessel, stir so that it will not curdle and put into a 
sauce boat.

72. White Cream Sauce. Take 4 fresh whipped 
eggs, 1 large cupful of wine, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 2 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, a few slices of lemon 
and some whole cinnamon (vanilla is better). This is 
whipped with an egg beater on the stove until it nearly 
boils, -then pour into another vessel and whip for 
another minute so that it will not curdle. 

73. White Cream Sauce with Rum. Take 1 large 
cupful of wine, 1 teaspoonful of fine flour, 2 eggs, the

3 tablespoonfuls of sugar; whip constantly until the 
cream is thick, then pour into another dish and whip a 
small glassful of rum through it. 

74. Cold Punch Sauce is made the same as the pre- 
ceding, taking instead of the whole eggs the yolks of 3 
large or 4 small eggs, stir the sauce until it uearlyboils, 
then take from the fire, let it cool, and add a glassful of 
arrac. This is a good sauce for cold puddings. 

75. Parisian Sauce for warm Puddings. Whip 1 
pint of sherry with 2% heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar, 
the yolks of 6 eggs and 3"spoonhils of apricot jelly until 
it nearly boils, then quickly stir into it 6 tablespoonfuls 
of thick sweet cream . Serve immediately. 

76. English Sauce for Plum Pudding. Stir 10 table- 
spoonfuls of apple jelly with 5 spoonfuls of brandy until 
it becomes watery, then add 2 cupfuls of thick sweet 
cream, whip on the stove until boiling hot and serve 
immediately. 

77. Claret Sauce. Take 1 pint of claret, % pound of 
sugar, a few pieces of cinnamon, the thin rind of half of 
a lemon and 2 tablespoonfuls of raspberry- or currant 
jelly, cover the dish and put it on the stove until it; is 
boiling hot, then smooth some cornstarch in cold water 
and add as much of it to the sauce as will give it the 
proper consistency. Serve in a sauce boat. 

78. Claret Sauce with dried Currants. Take 1—2 
ounces of dried currants, % of a lemon cut into thin 
slices (being careful to remove the seeds), and a few- 
pieces of cinnamon. Put this into 1 large cupful of 
water, cover and cook slowly for about a quarter of. an 



Wine, Milk and Fruit Sauces. 367 

hour, or until the currants have become softened. Then 
add 1 large cupful of wine and sugar and when it is boil- 
ing hot, add a little cornstarch smoothed in water, to 
bind the sauce. 

79. Cold Claret Sauce with Rum. This sauce is 
made the same as claret sauce, only adding more sugar. 
After taking it from the fire and it has cooled some- 
what, stir through it 1 small cupful of rum. 

80. Red Cream Sauce. Follow the directions given 
for white cream sauce, but use claret. Instead of taking 
lemon slices use fruit syrup or currant jelly if preferred. 

81. Pure Sago Sauce. For 6 persons take about 
2% ounces of sago, wash and cook slowly with a little 
water, whole cinnamon and lemon peel, then add some 
sugar, the juice of a lemon and some wine; boil until 
the sauce is of the proper thickness, let it come to a boil 
again and then strain. Pure sago must cook for at 
least 2 hours. Pearl sago can also be used and requires 
only % hour cooking. 

82. Chocolate Sauce. After dissolving 2% ounces of 
chocolate (see under V, Nos. 4 and 5), add 1 large cupful 
of sweet cream, 1 large cupful of milk flavored with a 
little vanilla, add sugar and stir the sauce with the 
yolks of 2 eggs. 

83. Almond Sauce. 1 ounce of pounded almonds 
(2 or 3 can be bitter), are cooked slowly with milk and 
a little vanilla for a quarter of an hour, strain, then 
add 1 pint of milk or cream, 2 teaspoonfuls of flour and 
sugar, cook again, then stirwith the yolks of 2 — 3 eggs. 

84. Cold Cream Sauce with Jelly or Claret. Appro- 
priate with milk dishes of all kinds. Take 1 cupful of 
dissolved raspberry or currant jelly — or the juice — whip 
with 1 large cupful of sweet cream until it is creamy. 
Or else whip half claret and half thick cream with sugar 
and cinnamon until it creams, and then stir through 
it a few spoonfuls of arrac. 

85. Sauce *nade of Fresh Currants. Served warm or 
cu/d. Take 1 pint of fresh currant juice, % pOund of 
sugar and a little cinnamon. Put the juice of the cur- 
rants on the stove with 1 large cupful of water together 



368 R.— Satjces. 

with sugar and cinnamon, remove any scum that may 
appear and thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch 
smoothed in water. 

86. Currant Juice Sauce. After the juice has been 
pressed from the currants as in making jelly, put it into 
a dish and stir with powdered sugar for a quarter of an 
hour before serving. To a pint of juice take % pound of 
sugar. This sauce, which has a pretty color and is very 
refreshing and delicious, is unexcelled for blanemangers 
and cold rice dishes. 

87. Raspberry Sauce. Cook raspberry sauce or jelly 
with water and white sour wine, cinnamon and sugar 
and thicken a little with cornstarch smoothed in water. 

88. Strawberry Sauce. Take fresh picked straw- 
berries (wild berries are the best), press them through a 
strainer, mix with % pound of sugar, the juice of 1 lemon 
and about 1 pint of Madeira, whip the sauce on the 
stove until it boils. This sauce is served warm with 
puddings. 

If you wish to serve this sauce cold, with cold pud- 
dings, do not boil it but stir with strawberry juice, 
sugar and vanilla and about 1 pint of thick sweet cream 
for about half an hour. Both kinds are very good 
sauces. 

89. Cream Sauce from Raspberry or Currant Juice. 

Whip 4 fresh eggs, 1 teaspoonful of flour and 1 pint of 
fresh raspberries or currant juice on the stove, sweeten 
with sugar and whip with an egg beater, but do not 
boil. When takingthe juice of preserved berries mix 
with one-third the quantity of wine or water. 

90. Sauce made of Fresh or Dried Cherries. Take 
dried sour cherries with a few stones, pound them in a 
mortar with the addition of a few lemon slices, and 
then strain through a large sieve. Then cook the sauce 
again, add sugar, ground cinnamon and a few cloves, 
thicken the sauce with cornstarch smoothed in water 
until it is of the proper consistency. If liked, a little 
arrac can also be added. 

91. Sauce for Farina Pudding. Cook 1 pint of white 
wine, 1 pint of water, the juice of a lemon and a little

I. CAKES. 



1. General Directions. To be successful with cakes, 
pastry, etc., their ingredients should be put into a warm 
place for a few hours— in the Winter for a night— to get 
them to the proper temperature, and the stirring and 
working should also be done in a warm place where 
there is no draught. With pie crust and puff paste this 
is not necessary. When the whites of eggs are to be 
frothed, they should not be brought where it is warm 
before they are to be used. Directions for frosting see 
A, No. 2. 

The flour and cornstarch used must always be of 
the best quality. As soon as warm both the flour and 
sugar should be sifted ; for very fine cakes the addition 
of some rice flour is recommended. Flour and sugar 
are more or less moist and should then be sifted after 
warming and drying. 

The butter used should be of the best and unsalted. 
Cream the butter, put it on boiling water or on top of 
the stove until soft, but it must not melt, then with a 
wooden ladle rub it to a cream. 

The eggs must be perfectly fresh ; a single slightly 
stale egg will be sufficient to spoil the cake, and for this 
reason eggs should be broken into a separate dish. The 
extract of lemon can often be substituted for lemon peel 
and juice. Lemon peel used in too large a quantity will 
impart an unpleasant taste to any dish, and the same 
is the case with cardamom seeds, which are not liked 
bv everybody. Cakes* in which yeast is used can be 
nicely flavored with rose water. Before the dough is put 



Cakes. 371 

into the mould be sure that the latter has been prop- 
erly prepared, nicely cleaned, rubbed with butter and 
dredged "with rolled crackers or grated bread so that it 
will not be necessary to first get the mould ready while 
the dough is waiting for it. Many a cake is spoiled 
through this cause. Puff paste does not require a 
buttered mould. 

Puff paste must never be kneaded, because this will 
make it heavy. To have it light and flakey put the 
butter into the "middle of the flour, stir and work the- 
dough with a knife at first, then with the ball of the 
hand, turning the dough frequently and folding it from 
the sides to the center, often dusting with flour and con- 
tinue in this manner until flour and butter are thor- 
oughly mixed ; then set aside in a cool place for a few 
hours. 

The addition of baking powder in biscuits, bread 
and almond cakes and the like will tend to make them 
lighter. 

When using yeast be cautious to get it fresh and 
sweet. For baking with yeast the milk must be luke- 
Avarm and the flour, butter, sugar and the baking dish 
should also be slightly warm. When using baking pow- 
der all of the ingredients should be cold. After the 
dough has been well stirred, it will be greatly improved, 
smoother and finer if the mass is vigorously and unin- 
terruptedly beaten for a while. To beat a soft dough 
use the flat side of a ladle. Firm doughs are beaten on 
the moulding board; fold the dough and continue the 
beating and folding as long as indicated in the several 
receipts. Afterwards set the dough in a warm place 
where there is no draught, cover with a clean cloth and 
let it raise for 1% — 2 hours. Slow fermentation produces 
a mild dough, whereas if it raises too quickly the dough 
will be tough. 

The degree of heat in the oven can be tested by 
means of a piece of paper. If the paper soon turns to a 
yellow (not black) color in the oven, this indicates the 
first degree of heat and is sufficient for puff paste and 
yeast doughs ; if it turns yellow slowly it indicates the 
second degree of heat, fit for most kinds of baking; the 
third degree must be still lower for cakes, etc., that 
should drv more than bake. 



372 S.— Pastry, Cakes, Etc. 

In the receipts for the cakes, the time for baking is 

fiveri as precisely as possible, but the length of time to 
nish the baking depends largely upon the heat of the 
oven; there are vario us tests for determining how near 
the cake is done, such as piercing it with a straw or 
something similar, whieh, if dry when drawn Out, indi- 
cates £hat the cake is done. Leaving the cake in the 
oven unnecessarily long is very detrimental to it, partic- 
ularly if it is a yeast cake. 

After the cake has been taken out of the oven let it 
stand in the mould for about 10 minutes where there is 
no draught. Then take it out of the mould but do not 
bring it into a cold room at once. Cake moulds made 
so that the outer rim is removable are the best, because 
then the cake can be taken out without shaking, which 
causes spongy cakes to fall. All kinds of cakes should 
be turned out of the mould onto a wire cake cooler, 
which will allow them to cool more readily. The mould 
should be cleaned with soft paper or a cloth immedi- 
ately after being used. 

Cakes will keep best in a tightly covered porcelain 
or glass dish. Tin cake boxes are also very good, but 
must be cleaned from time to time with hot water and 
frequently aired. Yeast or fruit cakes are the best when 
fresh, although they are good after a few days when 
placed in the oven for a few moments before serving. If 
it should happen that a fruit cake is not baked until 
done at first, it will not lose in taste if it is finished the 
next day in a hot oven. 

2. Puff Paste. J. pqund of dry flour, 1 pound of 
good butter, 1 — 1% cupfuls of cold water, 1 small glass- 
ful of rum or arrac and 1 whole egg. 

The evening before wanted, wash the butter so that 
it will become firm, spread on a plate to about the 
thickness of 1 inch and put into the cellar. The next 
day put the flour on the bread board, make a depres- 
sion in the center of the flour, put in the egg, water and 
rum, stir with a knife and work the dough with the 
hands as you would bread. It must not be too stiff, 
neither must it stick to the hands. Then roll out about 
% inch thick, put the butter on this, fold the dough and 
set aside in a cool place for a while. Then roll again, 
usirig but very little flour for dusting. Brush off any 



Cakes. 373 

flour that may be on the dough, fold again and set 
aside for a second time. Proceed in this manner until 
the dough has been set aside four times. Before rolling 
the dough for the fourth time, cut off a piece for the 
edge, roll *the larger piece uiitil quite thin, lay on this a 
plate of the desired size and cut the dough, dust a 
very little flour over this and fold it, because it can be 
handled better that way, and put it onto the plate, 
brush off any flour that may be on the dough, wet the 
edge all around with egg or a little water, lay an edge 
of the rolled dough on this and with a knife cut into the 
dough in various places so that it will not blister. Pro- 
ceed in this manner until all the dough is used and bake 
immediately, otherwise the puff paste will not be good. 
Bake to a golden brown. 

s 3. Saarbruck Puff Paste. % pound of butter pre- 
pared as directed under No. 2, % pound of flour, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of arrac and a large half cupful of cold water. 
Half of the flour is made into a dough with water 
and the arrac, then the butter and the remaining flour 
kneaded into the dough, each part rolled separately, 
then lay one on the other and roll out three times more. 

4. Good Crust for Pies and Pastry. To 1 pound 
of flour take % pound of good freshened butter, 1 whole 
and the yolk of 1 egg, and 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy 
or rum. The flour is pu+ intc a pan, the butter broken 
into small pieces and mixec 1 through the flour. Make a 
depression in the center o. the flour, beat the egg in 
% cupful of water, add to the flour with the brandy, Stir 
to a dough with a knife rolling it four times like puff 
paste. 

Remark.— This dough is especially nice In the Summer, because in warm 
weather a puff paste is hard to make tor those not accustomed to it. 

.5. English Crust for Tarts, Cookies, etc. 1 pound 
of flour, % pound of sifted sugar, % pound of pounded 
almonds, the yolk of 1 raw egg, the yolks of 9 hard 
boiled eggs chopped very fine, 10 ounces of freshened 
butter broken into small pieces and enough white wine 
to make an easily rolled dough. 

6. ' Oood Batter for large Cakes. To 1% pounds of 
flour take 1 pound of freshened butter, 2 ounces, of sugar 



374 S.— Pastby, Cakes, Etc. 

and % wineglassful of cold water. This is all worked 
together, but not kneaded. Then set the dough aside 
in a cool place, roll and bake in a moderately hot oven. 

7. Yeast Batter for German Fruit Cakes. 1 pound 
of warmed flour, % pound of freshened butter, 1 egg, the 
yolks of 2 eggs, 3 spoonfuls of sugar, 1. small cupful of 
lukewarm milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of dissolved yeast. 
Mix the yeastwith a very little sugar and a teaspoonful 
of salt, stir one-half of the flour with milk and one-half 
of the yeast, then add the remaining flour, the softened 
butter, yeast and salt, stir the dough as given under 
No. 1, roll or press it with the hands and set aside to 
raise in a warm place. 

8. A Cream for large fresh Prune Cake. 1 quart 
of thick sour cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, vanilla or a little grated lemon 
peel. Whip up the cream with*the whole eggs, and when 
the cake is almost done put it over the cake a spoonful 
at a time. After the cake is baked, strew some sugar 
thickly over it. 

9. Frosting for Tarts or small Cakes and for Dec- 
orating. % pound of powdered sugar, the white of an 
egg beaten to a froth, the juice of a large lemon or 
1 tablespoonful of rum or arrac. 

Stir the sugar and lemon peel together, then add 
the beaten white of the egg, a spoonful at a time, stir- 
ring constantly until as white as snow. This icing is 
poured over the cake after it has cooled, drying it in the 
sun or in the oven. The cake can be decorated with 

Eowdered sugar, but this must be done before the icing 
as cooled. 

10. To color Icing. A portion of the icing can be 
colored, leaving part of it white for decorating: Brown — 
by grating into it a little chocolate; red — by stirring 
into it a little currant- or raspberry juice ; dark red — by 
adding a trifle of cochineal ; (do not season the icing 
with lemon or it will have a yellowish red color ; a little 
dissolved red gelatine can also be used); blue — with 
kermes and a little lemon juice ; violet — with extract of 
violet ; yellow — lemon rind grated on sugar or saffron, 
dropping a little brandy on it ; green — with a little spin- 
ach juice. 



Cakes. 375 

11. Colored Sugar for Decorating. Put J£ pound of 
poppy seed into a dish, boil % pound of sugar dissolved 
in a little water, and after it has cooled somewhat put 
1 spoonful over the poppy seed and stir with the flat 
hand until it commences to get cold. Repeat 8 — 10 
times, when all of the sugar will be used. 

The coloring is done in the following manner ; Red — 
with a little cochineal ; yellow — saffron (using but very 
little), letting it draw in a few drops of brandy; some 
of the sugar remains white. Many colors are adulter- 
ated and none other than the above mentioned should 
be used. 

12. Lubec Marzapan. 1 pound of fresh, sweet al- 
monds, 1 pound of powdered sugar, orangeflower water 
and some sugar for dusting. 

Blanch the almonds and dry them in a cloth, grate 
and then put. them into a stewpan on a slow fire with 
orangeflower water and stir until they no longer adhere 
to the hands, but they must not be any dryer. Then 
put on a bread board dusted with sugar, roll, dusting 
enough sugar underneath and over the almond paste 
to prevent sticking, form into cakes with a nice edge or 
stamp out small figures and bake in a slow oven, not 
allowing the marzapan to become hard, but keeping it 
white and soft. 

13. Almond Marzapan. 1 pound of the best sweet 
and % ounce of bitter almonds, 1 pound of powdered 
sugar and rosewater. 

The almonds are prepared as in the above receipt. 
Then grate as fine as flour, mix with the sugar and 
rosewater to a stiff dough, which must not be too soft 
when rolling it out. Dust the bread board with sugar, 
divide the dough into round pieces, roll out to about 
the thickness of a table knife and cut into small round 
cakes or any other desired shape. In making the edge, 
roll the dough quite long, cut into narrow strips and 
brush with rosewater, and indent the edge with the 
thumb or with a knife. At this stage heat the cover of 
a tart pan with glowing coa)s, put the cakes on some 
paper, place the hot cover over them and bake to a 
light yellow. Let them cool on the paper and lay on a 
flat dish. In the meantime stir 1 pound of powdered 



376 S.— Pastry, Cakes, Etc. 

sugar with rosewater for % hour, fill the marzapan to 
the edge with this and as soon as the sugar is hard lay 
over it some preserved fruits. 

14. Marseilles Tarts. 1 pound of flour, 6 ounces 
of sugar, the yolks of 4 and 2 whole eggs and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter are made into a dough, roll quite 
thick, cut into small cubes and bake in freshened butter

and a littlr rose or orangeflower water and after skim- 
ming the sugar add 3 ounces of finely sliced candied 
orange peel, the sliced peel of a fresh lemon, 2 ounces of 
sweet and 1 ounce of bitter almonds cut into pieces, 
jounce of cinnamon, % ounce of cloves, % ounce of car- 
damom seeds, all finely pounded and mixed with the 
dough. Then press the whole into a warm mould which 
has been brushed with wax, let it cool and turn onto 
a dish. 

15. Bride's Cake. 1 pound of fresh butter, 1 pound 
of fresh grated almonds, 1 pound of powdered sugar, 
1 pound of warmed flour, 12 eggs, the grated rind of a 
lemor and a teaspoonful of mace. For brushing the

sugar, Yi pound of freshened butter and the juice of 
4 lemons, using the grated rind of one of them. 

Cream the butter (see No. 1) add sugar, spices, the 
yolks of eggs and almonds under constant stirring, 
and stir for % hour as directed under No. 1. Then 
slowly add the flour, also the beaten whites of the eggs, 
and bake four cakes of equal size with a moderate fire 
to a dark yellow, not brown, color. 

Cover the cakes with a lemon cream, letting the 
butter melt on a slow fire, stir sugar, lemon peel, yolks 
of eggs and lemon juice to the butter until it is thick, 
take from the fire, stir for a while longer, spread three 
cakes with this, pour over the top the frosting given 
under No. 9, and decorate the top. This cake is much 
nicer when it is a few days old, which is the case with all 
layer cakes. Being very rich this cake is cutjnto fine 
slices when sent to the table. Eemnants of the cake can 
be kept for some time by taking care of them as directed 
uider No. 1.

878 S.— Pastry, Cakes, Etc. , 

19. Almond Cake. No. 1. 1 pound of fresh sweet 
and % ounce of bitter almonds, % pound of sifted sugar, 
12—15 eggs, 1 lemon, a slip of mace, 2 heaping spoon- 
fuls of finely grated and sifted potato flour, or better 
still rice Hour. 

The almonds are hulled, washed, dried and grated, 
the yolks of the eggs stirred with the sugar on which half 
of the lemon is grated, then add the juice, mace and the 
almonds, constantly stirring for % hour (see No. 1). Mix 
the whites of the eggs lightly through this, then the 
flour and baking powder, pour into a form, put into a 
moderately hot oven and bake iorl% hours. Do not jar 
the form; the heat mustnotbestrongerfrom the bottom 
than from the top. To make this cake look prettier 
pour over it a frosting as given under No. 9, and dot 
this with preserved or candied fruit sliced as thin as 
paper. 

20. Almond Cake with Wheat Bread. No. 2. Take 
10 ounces of sifted sugar, 8 ounces of fresh sweet and 
1 ounce of bitter almonds, grated, 12 — 14 eggs, 6 ounces

directed under No. 1, add the almonds to this and stir 
for ){ hour longer. When this is done mix the wheat 
bread quickly through the mass and lightly stir through 
it the beatetf whites of the eggs. The cake is baked a'nd 
frosted the same as the above cake. It can also, be 
baked in layers and spread with jelly. A very pretty 
way is to color one part green, one part red and one 
part brown. 

21. Orange Cake. Make an almond dough of 6 
ounces of grated almonds, % pound of sifted sugar, 
12 eggs (the whites beaten to a froth), a little more 
than 2 ounces of flour, 2 tablespoohfuls of arrac, or else 
half of the puff paste as given under No. 3, and out of 
this bake two layers. Then on the stove beat to a thick 
cream 2 whole and the yolks of 4 eggs, % pound of sifted 
sugar, the juice of 4 oranges, the juice of 2 lemons and 
the rind of an orange grated on some sugar, spread 
over one layer, put the other layer on this and frost the 
latter with the following: The juice ofl orange is stirred 



Cases. 379 

with % pound of Bitted sugar and 1 tablespoonful of 
water; then follow the directions as given under No. 9. 
By taking 1 — 2 teaspoonfuls of raspberry juice the frost- 
ing will be of a pretty red color ; when using this omit 
the water so that the frosting will not be too thin. 
Decorate the top layer with candied orange slices. 

22. Chocolate Cake. Stir % pound of butter to a 
cream and add 6 ounces of sugar, the yolks of 8 eggs, 
6 ounces of dissolved chocolate, 1 spoonful of vanilla, 
1 spoonful of lemon sugar and % pound of flour, con- 
stantly stirring, and beat the dough for % hour. Then 
stir through it the beaten whites of 6 eggs, pour into a

of fresh pork fat. Then put a small spoonful of dough 
into the iron and bake both sides to a golden brown. 
Sprinkle sugar over the waffles. 



III. CAKES BAKED IN BUTTER, LARD AND OIL. 

132. Rules for Baking. Slow raising of" the dough 
will greatly improve it and make it smoother. For 
doughnuts and the like, the dough should not be too 
soft, at the same time it must not be compact, and for 
this reason a few eggs should be added to prevent 
absorption of the fat ; salt must not be forgotten. The 
moulding board must always be carefully dusted with 
flour so that the dough will not adhere to it, which, 
would also cause the fat to penetrate. 

Butter, of course, always makes the finest baking.. 
The method of preparing it for the various receipts in. 
this subdivision has been explained in Division A. No. 8.': 
Good lard is also well adapted for the various kinds of 
baking in this subdivision. 



Cakes baked in Bctter, Lard and Oil. 411 

A sufficient quantity of lard or butter should always 
be taken because when plenty of it is used the articles 
baked in it will not absorb so much and have a pleas- 
anter flavor; a pound or two will generally be sufficient. 
After being used once it can be used again with the 
addition of some fresh butter or fat, and whatever is 
then left can be utilized in cooking. Take it from the 
fire as soon as the baking is done, pour it into a dish 
and when cold take off the settlings, melt the fat and 
set aside. 

A medium fire is necessary for baking in fat. The 
kettle should be deep enough that boiling over need not 
be feared, and quite wide so that a quantity of the 
baking can be done at one and the same time. Before 
beginning to bake get the fat so hot that when a piece 
of the dough is dropped into it, it will at once rise to 
the top. The quicker the cakes brown in the fat, the 
less the latter can penetrate the dough and make it 
greasy. Should the fat become too hot, however, take 
the kettle from the fire a fewminutes before commencing 
to bake; it is advisable to always reserve about one- 
fourth of the fat and to add a small quantity of it when- 
ever the contents of the. kettle become too hot. 

When baking cakes in which yeast is used, for in- 
stance "Berlin pancakes", the upper side is put into the 
fat first. Shake the kettle occasionally and when brown 
from below turn the cakes with a fork, and when the top 
is brown also take them out, lay them on a piece of 
absorbent (blotting) paper'for awhile, turn in powdered 
sugar and dust some of this over the top. 

133. Berlin Pancakes ("Berliner Pfannkuchen"). 

For thedough take 1 cupful of milk, % pound of clarified 
butter,. 1 whole egg and the yolks of 5 eggs, scant 2 
ounces of yeast, 2 ounces of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt 
and flour. For filling, currants, cherries, jelly or mar- 
malade. 

Flour and butter are warmed. Then whip the eggs, 
stir the lukewarm milk with the eggs, yeast, butter, 
sugar, salt and flour into a dough which is beaten until 
it bubbles, and no longer sticks to the spoon. Then set 
it aside to raise. When this is done roll it out to about 
the thickness of one-half inch and put a teaspoonful of 
the fruit jelly or marmalade 2 inches apart on half of 



412 S— Pastry, Cakes, Etc. 

the dough and lay the other half over this, and then 
with a glass cut so as to have the dots of jelly in the 
center of the cakes, and let them raise again. Then heat 
the fat, put the cakes in side by side with the tops to 
the bottom, putting in just enough cakes to cover the 
fat. They must be of a dark yellow color, and when 
done turn in powdered sugar or sprinkle with sugar 
and cinnamon ; serve fresh. If wished they can also be 
frosted. 

134. Doughnuts. 1 pint of water is boiled with

bake in lard to a dark brown color. 

139. Swiss Rolls. Small rolls or milk breads are cut 
in two in the center, soaked in milk so that they are soft 
all through, and then put on a dish to drain. They are 
then fried in hot lard to a yellow brown color, sprinkled 
with sugar and cinnamon or powdered sugar, and 
brought to the table hot. They are nice with tea, also 
for dessert with whipped cream or a wine sauce. 

140. Baked Wheat Loaf. 1 large fresh wheat loaf, 
1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, cinna-

butter as given under No, 132 to a yellowish brown 
color, and while hot sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. 

This is served as a dessert with a cream or fruit 
sauce. The bread can also be sprinkled with almonds 
and baked in a hot oven to a nice yellow color, basting 
often with butter. 

141. Pilled Bread. Cut the crust from a wheat loaf, 
then cut it in two and hollow each half a little.

sprinkled with sugar and if liked spread with whipped 
cream. Bake in a moderate oven for M hour. 

143. Apple Slices Baked in Butter or Lard. Peel 
large cooking apples and cut into slices % inch thick, 
take out the core. Soak in arrac and sugar for a short 
time, dip them into a sauce as given in K., No. 92, fry in 
butter and when done sprinkle with sugar seasoned with 
vanilla. Instead of apples, pears, peeled and sliced 
oranges, plums and apricots can be used. 

In order that the apples may absorb but little fat, 
do not put more into the fat than will swim on the top.

IV. BREAD. 



145. Rolls or Hilk Bread. To 1 quart of fresh milk 
take 4 pounds of flour, yeast and a little salt. 

Set the flour in a warm place for a few hours, and 
have the milk lukewarm; add the dissolved yeast to the 
milk and stir enough flour to the milk to make a not 
too thin dough; then set aside. After this has raised, 
add the salt, and work in the remaining flour until the 
dough no longer sticks to the hands. The kneading 



Cakes baked in Butter, Lard and Oil. 415 

must be done with the flat hand. Then beat the dough 
as given under No. 1, form into loaves which must be 
smooth on the top, let them raise again, cut into the 
dough, spread with beaten egg, put into a hot oven and 
bake until done. 

Milk* breads can be greatly improved by adding to 
the above 4 eggs and % pound of butter. 

146. Sour Rye Bread. To 1 quart of water add 5 
pounds of -rye flour and some sour dough (leavening) 
the size of au apple. 

The evening before baking warm the water and mix 
the leavening with part of the flour into a thin dough, 
dust with flour and set aside to raise until the next 
morning. Then knead in the salt and the remaining 
flour, make into a long loaf, set to raise again and bake 
in a hot oven for 2 hours. 

If the dough should not have raised enough, work 
in a little yeast when kneading; if buttermilk is used 
instead of water, the bread will be nicer ; then use only 
half of the leavening. 

147. Rice= and Wheat Bread. Boil 1 pound of 
rice in milk until tender and while warm mix with it 
4 pounds of wheat flour, some dissolved yeast, 1 spoon- 
ful of salt and enough water to make a stiff dough,

2 loaves. Spread with beaten egg and bake in a hot 
oven. 



T.— Preserved and Dried Fruits 
and Vegetables. 



1. Rules to be observed in Preserving Fruits. Par- 
ticular care should be taken that all fruit which is to be 
preserved is well cleaned, and when possible always rub 
clean with a cloth. 

The kettle in which the fruits are cooked must 
not have been used for preparing fatty food. A new 
double kettle filled with cold water, put on the fire and 
brought to a boil, or an enameled kettle is the best, 
Spoons and skimmers must not be greasy, and when- 
ever possible the kitchen utensils used in making pre- 
serves should be devoted to this purpose only. 

The vinegar should always be of the very best 
quality obtainable. 

During the time the fruits are on the fire nothing 
else should becooked that will emit a strong or pungent 
odor, such as cabbage or other vegetables, fat, etc., 
because this will act deleteriously on the fruit. The fire 
should be well attended to at the beginning, and if you 
have a coal fire it should not be disturbed, because the 
gas thereby liberated is also harmful to the fruit. 

The fruit jars must be scrupulously clean and should 
be rinsed thoroughly a day or so before using, and dried 
in the sun or open air. When the jars are filled be care- 
ful to have the fruit covered wjth juice as much as pos- 
sible ; a teaspoonful of arrac or French brandy poured 
in at the top, or a circular piece of paper cut the size of 
the mouth of the jar, soaked iu these liquors and placed 
on top of the fruit; will be found of great advantage. . 



T.— Preserved and Dried Fruits, Etc. 417 

Cloves are used in numerous varieties of preserves, 
but are apt to produce bla«k spots on light colored 
vegetables or fruits, such as pumpkins, walnuts, etc. ; to 
prevent this the heads of the cloves must be removed. 

Fruits and vegetables such as pickles, prunes, cher- 
ries, etc., preserved in vinegar should be covered with an 
inverted saucer and weighted with a small stone, which 
must not be heavy enough to produce much pressure, 
but enough to keep the fruit or pickles under the juice 
or brine. Asmall muslin bagcontaining mustard seeds, 
the bag large enough to cover all of the pickles, is a 
good medium for preserving them. 

Pickles and preserves should always be set aside in 
a cool, airy, dry place. The cellar is not usually well 
adapted for this purpose on account of dampness, 
especially in the Winter. 

If a scum forms on the surface of the liquor con- 
taining the pickles, which is commonly caused through 
the inferior quality of the vinegar, wash the jar care- 
fully and dry it, rinse the pickles in cold water 4 , boil the 
vinegar and take off the scum, add some fresh vinegar, 
put part of the pickles into it for a few minutes, let 
them cool on a flat dish, then put them into the jar 
again and cover with the vinegar. Should the viuegar, 
however, have become flat without spoiling the pickles, 
it is of no further use and should be thrown away. 
Take fresh vinegar, put it on the fire with the rinsed 
pickles and the spices (which should be rinsed on a 
sieve) and as soon as the vinegar is hot take out the 
pickles, bring the vinegar to a boil, and as soon as it 
is cool pour it over the pickles. 

Directions for keeping dill in good condition will be 
found under A. No. 41. 

2. Clarifying Sugar for Preserves. The sugar should 
always be of good quality. It is clarified as follows : 
Put it on the fire in a very clean copper or enameled 
kettle in the proportion of 1 pound of sugar to % pint 
of water, and let it boil until clear, taking off any scum 
that may appear. 

If the sugar is to boil until it beads, have a slow fire, 
but then do not use an enameled kettle, because the. 
enamel will crack.

3. To Prevent Preserves from becoming candied. 

Fruits candy because they*ere either too- dry or because 
the sugar was boiled down too much. The latter diffi- 
culty can be obviated by exercising due caution ; if it is 
impossible to obtain any other than dry fruits that are 
not juicy, add a trifle of citric acid diluted with a little 
water to the fruit juice, after it is poured from the fruits 
and brought to a boil. 



I. FRUITS PRESERVED IN FRENCH BRANDY. 

Semaek.— It is important to use the best, genuine French Brandy j if adulter- 
ated or inferior qualities are taken, the preserves will spoil. 

4. flixed Fruits in Brandy. 1 cupful of pure brandy 
and to every pound of fruit 1 pound of sugar. The fruit 
must not beover-ripe and should be carefully wiped with 
a cloth. Begin by putting in the strawberries first, then 
the raspberries, currants, cherries with the stems half, 
cut away, apricots, peaches, pears, peeled and sliced 
melon, grapes, and whatever other fruits are desired. . 

Pour the brandy into a clean dish which can be 
tightly covered. Put in 1 pound of strawberries and at 
the same time 1 pound of pulverized sugar ; set the dish 
aside in a very cool place. With every pound of the 
succeeding fruits put in 1 pound of sugar, stirring very 
carefully. If any considerable quantity of the fruit is to. 
follow it will be necessary to add another cupful of 
brandy. After the last lot of fruit has been stirred 
through, fill the preserves into- jars and follow general 
directions in No. 1 of this division. 

5. Fruit in Brandy (French method). For 1 quart 
of brandy, 1 pound of the best sugar. 

The fruit, which ought not be too ripe, must, be. 
wiped clean with a cloth and put into cans in layers; 
with the sugar, then pour in as much brandy as "will 
cover the fruit, cover the jar and proceed" as given 
under No. 1. Put into a boiler with cold water, between 
straw, and put on the fire. Let the fruit cook for'/{ 
hour and then cool in the water. 



Preserved Fruits. 419 

6. Cherries in Brandy. 3 pounds of sweet cherries, 
1% pounds of sugar, 1 pint of brandy, cinnamon and 
cloves. 

Put the-fruit into cans after having been cleaned 
and half of the stems taken off. Then clarify the sugar 
as directed under No. 2, let it cool, stir the brandy 
through it, put a few pieces of cloves and cinnamon into 
the syrup, pour it over the cherries and cover the cans. 

7. Quinces in Cognac. For each pound of quinces 
(weighed after cooking) take % pound of sugar, cognac, 
lemon peel and cinnamon. 

Peel the quinces, cut each one into eight parts, and 
after taking out the seeds put them into cold water. 
In the meantime bring some water to aboil and cook 
the quinces in this until they can easily be pierced with 
a fork, but they must not become soft. 

Then take them out with a skimmer, lay them on a 
colander to drain, put a fine slice of lemon peel and cin- 
namon on each piece of citron. Then clarify the sugar 
as given under No. 2, cook for a while with the citron 
water, pour hot over the quinces and after 48 hours 
boil the juice. Then stir in as much cognac as wanted, 
and pour over the citron. 



II. PRESERVED FRUITS. 

8. Preserved Strawberries with Currant Juice. For 

1 pound of strawberries takel pound of sugar, put one- 
half of the sugar over the berries and leave them over- 
night. The next day cook the sweetened berries with 
currant- or apple juice, which has been boiled until 
thick, that is, not the berries but the juice is to be 
boiled ; put the juice and berries on the fire together, 
and as soon as the berries are heated through take 
them out and cook the jelly for a few minutes longer. 
This is served with roasts, also with biscuits and sand 
cakes ; served also alone with sweet cream. 

9. Strawberries preserved in English Style. The 

fresh berries are put into glasses in layers with sugar 
(6 ounces of sugar with 1 pound of fruit), pour over the 



420 T.— Preserved and Dried Fruits, Etc. 

fruit some boiling hot Madeira or Malaga, and close 
the glasses tightly, wrap them in hay so that they will 
not touch one another, put them into a kettle, bring 
the water to a boil and cook the fruit until about one- 
fourth is boiled away ; then take the kettle from the fire 
and leave the glasses in it until quite cool. Take them 
out and set aside in a cool place. 

10. Strawberry Marmalade. 1 pound of straw- 
berries, 1% pounds of sugar ; cook the strawberries in 
the clarified sugar under constant stirring until they 
become pulpy and the juice is thick. Can as directed 
under No. 1. 

Or the heated berries may be passed through a 
sieve and stirred with sugar (to 1 pound of berries take 
2 pounds of sugar), fill the marmalade into glasses, 
which must be covered immediately, cook in a double 
boiler for ]i hour, leaving them in the boiler until cold. 

11. Strawberry Juice for Invalids. 1 quart of fresh 
ripe strawberries, 1 pound of sugar. Cook the sugar to 
a syrup, lay in the fruit, stir carefully through the 
syrup with a silver spoon without breaking the berries, 
let them heat through but they must not boil. Then 
spread over a dish a thin muslin cloth, which must first 
be rinsed in fresh boiling water, and pour the fruit into 
the muslin so that the juice will drip through. The 
berries must not be pressed nor crushed. Pour the 
juice from the settlings into small bottles. 3 quarts 
of berries will give % quart of juice, which is very nice 
for invalids. The berries will make a good compot. 
They can also be put into glasses until currants and 
raspberries are ripe, and then cooked to a marmalade 
with these fruits, taking for 3 pounds of fresh fruit 
2 pounds of sugar. 

12. Grape Juice. Mash white grapes, set aside for 
a few days and then press them. Boil the juice, taking 
% pound of sugar for each 1 pound of juice, skim care- 
fully, let it cool and pour through a muslin cloth. Put

Preserved Fruits. 421 

and then mashed with a silver spoon and pressed 
through a sieve. Then put them into the sugar and 
spices, which have been boiled to a syrup, stir con- 
stantly and cook to a thick marmalade. In case it 
should turn watery after about a week it mn-t be boiled 
again. 

• 14. Preserved Walnuts. 1 pound of walnuts, 1 
pound of sugar, cinnamon and cloves. The nuts must 
be spotless and they should be freed from the inner skin. 
They are perforated in a few places with a sharp bodkin 
or larding needle, and left in cold water, which must be 
renewed three times daily for about a fortnight. Then 
change the water, boil the walnuts until tender, let 
them lay over night in cold water and the next morn- 
ing put them on a sieve to drain. Instead of sticking 
cloves all over the walnuts, whereby they lose their 
nice appearance, cook the spices with sugar and the 
walnuts, which will give them a nice spicy flavor. Some 
people prefer them without spices. The juice of a lemon 
and citron peel for every pound of sugar will also give 
the walnuts a pleasant flavor. Clarify the sugar as 
given under No. 2, and let the walnuts boil for a few 
minutes. After 3 — 4 days cook the sugar syrup again . put 
the walnuts into a jar and pour the hot juice over them. 

15. Raspberries are preserved the same as currants, 
but they must not be washed. 

16. Raspberry Jelly. Prepare the same as currant 
jelly (No. 22), adding a little currant juice, because the 
jelly will become thicker. Berries for jellies should not 
be quite ripe. • 

17. Raspberry flarmalade is prepared the same as 
strawberry marmalade, No. 10. 

18. Good Raspberry Vinegar. 2 quarts of raspber- 
ries, 1 quart of vinegar, for each quart of juice 1%

the fire with sugar, skim, set aside over night and then 
proceed as given under No. 1. All fruits must be kept 
in porcelain dishes. 



422 T.— Preserved and Dried Fruits, Etc. 

19. Currant Jelly. For each pound of juice take 
1 pound of sugar. Take the currants from the stems, 
mash them and then squeeze the juice through a cloth. 
After the juice is pressed out let it run through a coni- 
cal bag, set it aside until the next day and pour from 
the settlings. Put the juice on a slow fire, gradually 
adding the sugar, stirring constantly. When the sugar 
has all been put into the juice it must be ready to boil, 
then take from the fire, set aside for % hour, take off the 
skin and fill into glasses, and after 48 hours put over 
the top a paper dipped in brandy or arrac, and tie care- 
fully. 

20. French Currant Jelly. % pound of red and %

Preserved Fruits. 423 

half done, then put in the sour cherries and cook until 
tender, take out the juice, pour some of the juice into 
fruit jars, let the remaining juice boil for a while and 
pour over the cherries. To the cherry juice add for each

into small dry bottles, cork tightly and set in a cool 
place. 

26. Pineapple Peel Juice. Cut the peels of the pine- 
apples into small pieces, weigh, and take three times as 
much sugar as you have fruit, boil andskini; cook the 
peel in this for 10 minutes. Set the juice aside until the

fill into glasses ; cover tightly. The juice will keep for a 
long time. 

27. Preserved Apricots. For each pound of stoned 
apricots take 1 pound of sugar. The apricots are 
washed, peeled, halved and the stones taken out. They 
can also be left whole. Put the apricots into an enam- 
eled dish, the round side to the bottom, and sprinkle 
sugar over them. The next day put them on a slow 
fire until hot, but they must not become soft, pour 
them on a colander to drain, then put a few of the 
stories into a can, cook the juice a little while longer, 
then pour over the fruit and fill into glasses. After 
about a week cook the juice again and then pour cold 
over the fruit. 

28. Apricot and Peach flarmalade Marmalade? J 
should be cooked in very clean enameled kettles, stir- 
ring often, add the necessary sugar and as soon as 
done fill into fruit jars. The" fruit, which must not be 
too ripe, is scalded so that the peel will easily come off. 
Halve and stone them, take as much sugar as fruit, put 



424 T.— Preserved And Dried Fruits, Etc. 

into an enameled kettle with the thinly peeled rind of a 
lemon and a few pieces of ginger ; this will tend to keep 
the marmalade longer. Cook to a thick marmalade 
Until tender, stirring constantly with a new wooden 
spoon, as it is apt to scorch. Should it became watery 
after about a week, it will have to be cooked again. 

29. Cranberry Jelly. 1 pint of juice, 1 pound of 
sugar. Wash and clean the berries, put them into a 
moderately hot oven, stirring often until the juice is 
extracted. Squeeze through a muslin cloth, pour from 
the settlings, and for each pint of juice take 1 pound of 
sugar. Skim carefully and cook for about 15 minutes, 
take from the fire, and if any scum arises take it off.. 
Fill, the jelly into glasses. If cooked too long the jelly 
loses its nice red color ; it must be thick enough to cut, 
as it is very nice for decorating. Try a little of the jelly 
after it has cooked to ascertain if it is thick enough. 

30. Apple riarmalade. Pare and core the apples, 
and put them into a pan of fresh water acidulated with 
the juice of a lemon, so as to keep the fruit nice and 
white. For every pound of fruit take % pound of sugar, 
let it boil, skim carefully, add the thinly peeled rind of a 
lemon cut into small pieces, put in the apples, stirring 
constantly on a quick fire until thick. Take but little 
water, and the apples should be of a variety which will 
not become pulpy in cooking. 

31. Preserved Blackberries. 3 pounds of ripe blacky 
berries, 1 pound of sugar, cinnamon and a few cloves. 

Clarify the sugar, add the berries and spices and

the meantime boil the sugar, put in the pears and gin- 
ger aud cook until clear ; they must not be too tender. 
Then lay them on a porcelain dish to cool, and let the 
juice boil, lay the fruit into the cans and pour over 
them the hot syrup. Cover tightly and set aside in a 
cool place. 

They can also be preserved in cranberry juice, tak- 
ing 1 quart of cranberry juice, 12 ounces of sugar and 
% ounce of cinnamon for each 1% pounds of fruit. 

34. Preserved Pears, French Method. Peel the pears 
according to size, leave them whole or halve them, and 
as soon as peeled put them into water acidulated with 
lemon juice. Cook the pears in this water until they 
ean easily be pierced with a fork, take them out with a 
skimmer, thi'ow into cold water and let them drain. 
For every 2% pounds of pears take not quite V/ 2 pounds 
of sugar. Pour the clarified sugar over the pears and 
let them stand for 6 — 8 hours, pour off the juice, cook it 
until thick and then pour it over the pears again, after 
which set aside until the next day. Then pour off the 
juice once more, put a piece of lemon peel and a vanilla 
bean into a little bag and cook with the juice, put the 
pears into this and set on the stove for % hour. Then 
put into cans and cover tightly. This is a very nice 
way of preserving pears ; they have a brilliant white 
color and taste deliriously. 

35. Apple Jelly. 3 pounds of juice, 3 pounds of 
sugar, % tumblerful of white wine and 1 lemon. 

Take nice, juicy, not quite ripe apples, wipe them 
with a cloth, take out the stems, quarter without paring 
them, and cook in water until tender. Set the apples 
aside for 24 hours and then pour them into a jelly bag 
and let the juice drip into an enameled kettle. Boil the 
juice with sugar and after a while add wine and ldmon 
juice and cook until the juice, when cold, is thick. Fill 
into small glasses and cover tightly as given under 
No.l. 



426 T.— Preserved and Dried Fruits, Etc. 

Instead of lemon peel, a vanilla bean tied in a little 
Lag can be used ; citron slices can also be taken so as 
to make the jelly thicken quicker, but when using this it 
will lose its clear color and taste stronger. 

36. Apple flarmalade. 2 pounds of apples, 1 pound 
of sugar and 1 lemon . 

Peel the apples, wash twice and weigh them. Then 
clarify the sugar, add the apples and the juice of a 
lemon with the peel, cook quickly in an enameled kettle 
until done. Then mash the apples and cook to a thick 
marmalade, stirring often from the bottom. If after a 
week the marmalade has become watery, boil again, 
skimming carefully. 

37. Crab Apple Jelly. 1 pound of juice, % pound 
of sugar. Wash the apples, put them into a copper or 
an enameled kettle, cover with cold water, cook until 
tender and then press them through a sieve with the 
juice. The next day pour from the settlings, weigh, put 
on the fire with the sugar, skimming carefully, and cook 
for 1 hour, whereby this jelly obtains a nice red color. 
Fill into glasses and proceed as given for currant jelly. 
This jelly can be nicely moulded, and is well adapted for 
decorating, and can be cut into any desired ornament. 

38. Preserved Citron. 1 pound of citrori, %—l 
pound of sugar, cinnamon and if liked a few pieces of 
preserved ginger. 

Wipe the citron, peel, cut in two once and cook in 
water .with the peel and core until nearly tender. The 
core will give the citron a nice yellowish-red color. Then 
let them drain, cooking the juice for an hour longer, 
strain, add sugar and skim. Let the citron cook in 
this until tender, lay into a glass with cinnamon and 
ginger, cook the juice until thick and pour over the 
citron while still hot. The juice must cover the fruit the 
same as with all preserves. If they are liked slightly 
sour, add to each pound of citron, while cooking, the 
juice of a lemon. 

39. Quince Jelly. No. 1. 14 quinces and 2 pounds 
of sugar. The quinces are quartered, put into an enam- 
eled kettle, nearly covered with water and cooked until 
tender. Then pour the juice through a cloth;. it will 



Fruits Preserved in Sugar and Vinegar. 427 

amount to about 1 quart. Clarify the sugar, pour the 
juice of the quinces,from the settlings, add to the sugar 
and cook for about % hour, skimming carefully. The 
juice will by that time have the required consistency. . 

40. 'Quince Jelly. No. 2. Clean 1 dozen quinces 
and grate them to the core with the peel, squeeze the 
juice through a cloth and set aside over night and pour 
from the settlings. , For each pint of juice take 1 pound 
of sugar, clarify and boil it until it threads and then 
pour in the juice; put the seeds of the quinces into a 
little bag and boil with the juice. The seeds give the 
jelly a nice color. Skim carefully and let the juice boil 
for"% hour. The fruit must not be too ripe, otherwise it 
will be difficult to have it jelly perfectly. This jelly is 
of a very pretty color and tastes nicely. 

41. Quince flarmalade. 1 pound of quinces, % pound 
of sugar and 1 lemon. 

Cook the quinces in water until tender, peel and 
grate them, clarify the sugar, add the quinces, the finely 
cut peel of half a lemon and the juice of a whole lemon,

boil sugar and vinegar together and pour boiling, hot 
over the beans. The beans must be covered with the 
liguid and then pressed down with a plate weighted 
with a stone. After a week boil the vinegar again and 
pour it over the beans, which must be repeated after 
another week. The third time let the vinegar boil for a 
while~and pour over the beans so that they will be just 
covered. 

46. Sweet Cucumbers. 3 pounds of cucumbers, 1 
pound of sugar, 1 pint of water, % ounce of stick cinua- 

- mon, a few pieces of ginger, % ounce of cloves (taking off

spices and cook on a quick fire until they can easily be 
pierced ; if cooked too long they lose their nice color 
and will become dark brown. After they are cooked lay 
them into a glass, the round side to the top— do not 
pierce them with a fork — and pour the thick juice over 
them. Set them aside for a few days, boil down the 
juice again, pour hot over the pears and shake the 
glass once in a while so that they will settle, and cover 
tightly. 

A number of the foregoing preserves can be served 
to invalids; Nos. 8, 9, 11, 1.6, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 34, 
35, 38, 39 and 40 are particularly nice. 



IV. PICKLED VEGETABLES. 

49. Pickled Red Cabbage. Take cabbages that are 
firm and have fine leaves; remove the loose and coarse 
outer leaves, then quarter the heads and put them into 
medium-6ized stone jars in layers, sprinkling pepper- 
corns, cloves, bay leaves and dill between the layers, 
cover with a weak brine, placing a bag containing mus- 
tard seeds on top. Put a weight over all and cover 
the jar tightly. 

When preparing for the table shred the cabbage 
very finely, pour over it 'a dressing made of olive oil, 
vinegar and pepper; if served with roasts omit the

white cabbage and then pressed into a stone jar with a 
little -salt, covering with the above-named spices and 
some small pieces of ginger, or some sliced horseradish. 
Put a mustard seed bag on top and press down with 
a weight, after pouring a liquor of vinegar and water 
boiling hot over the whole. Cover tightly and set aside 



4:30 T.— Pkesehved axd Dkied Fruits, Etc. 

as directed above. When preparing for the table, take 
some of the cabbage, press it out and pour over it a 
dressing of salad oil and pepper. 

50. Pickled Onions. Small onions, whitd pepper, 
horseradish and tarragon. Wash the onions, and to 
take off the skin easily lay them into lukewarm water 
and let them cool in this, then with a knife take off the 
skin. If possible, a silver knife should be used for this 
purpose, because the onions will receive dark spots if a 
common knife is taken. After they are rinsed, boil the 
onions for a few moments in vinegar with white pepper, 
take them out and fill in layers into cans, with tar- 
ragon and horseradish, pour in the cooled vinegar and 
cover tightly. 

51. Pickled Eschalots and Onions. Select small 
onions. After they have been washed and peeled, strew 
salt over them, let them stand over night, the next day 
wash, heat the vinegar and put in the onions, stirring

layers with dill, tarragon, horseradish and peppercorns, 
and pour in the vinegar after it has cooled ; press down 
with a plate and cover closely. 

52. Pickled Beets. Use only the dark red beet. 
Cut off the tops, but none of the root, because the juice 
will then run out; wash the beets very clean, bake in 
the oven or else cook them in plenty of boiling water 
for 3 — 4- hours until they are tender. Do not pierce 
them with a fork and always add boiling water to 
replenish that which has boiled away. Then take off 
the skin, cut the beets into thin slices, lay them into a 
very clean, jar with peppercorns, cloves, (see No. 1), 
horseradish, coriander or a few pieces of ginger, and a 
very little salt, and, if liked, a few bay leaves. Pour 
over them enough vinegar so that they will be covered, 
and close the jar tightly. Serve them with soup meats, 
roasts, potato- and endive salad, and also, chopped 
fine, in herring salad. 

53. Preserved Mushrooms. Cut off the stems from 
small closed mushrooms, wash the latter in cold water 
and lay on a cloth to dry. Then heat plenty of clarified 
butter (see Division A, No. 8), lay the mushrooms with 



Pickled Vegetables. 431 

white peppercorns into this and boil them, constantly 
stirring. When they-are hot enough so that the juice 
will run out, take from the fire, put them into glasses 
with the juice and cover them with melted butter about 
% inch thick. After the butter has cooled put a layer of 
salt % inch thick over this, cover the glasses and set 
aside in a cool, airy place. 

54. Pickled flushrooms. Take cloves, pepper, bay 
leaves, tarragon, dried ginger and wine vinegar. Take 
the heads off the cloves as directed under T, No. 1. 

Large or small mushrooms can be used; clean and 
then wash them quickly so that they will not absorb 
too much water, and dry on a cloth. In the meantime 
boil some vinegar with spices, let the mushrooms come 
to a boil in this, lay them into glasses, boil the vinegar 
for a while longer and pour over the mushrooms. After 
a fortnight boil the vinegar again for a while and pro- 
ceed as directed under No. 1. 

55. Small Vinegar Pickles. For a 5-quart jar of 
pickles take 6 ounces of salt, % pound of small onions 
(laying the onions in salt with the cucumbers), % pound 
of horseradish cut into smooth, uniform slices, 1 ounce 
of dried gfnger, % ounce of peppercorns— the white are 
best— % ounce of cloves, 12 bay leaves, 2 handfuls of 
dill and 1 handful of tarragon. A handful of pepper- 
grass or cresses will improve the pickles; some unripe 
grapes may also be added. In order that the dill may 
be nice and fresh, observe the directions for keeping it 
given in a preceding Division. 

Select the pickles carefully, rejecting all that are 
spotted or damaged, wash in fresh water with salt, and 
set aside for 12 hours. Clean the onions in the same 
manner as directed for pickling them. The heads of the 
dili are either braided in three parts down as far as the 
seed, or else cut off short and neatly arranged around 
the edge of the dish when serving. Then lay the cucum- 
bers on a cloth to dry and put them into jars in layers 
with the spices. The jars, which must be new, should 
be used only for pickles ; they should be scalded before 
using. Then pour over the pickles raw wine vinegar, 
whereby they will retain t heir green color. After about 
a fortnight pour off the vinegar, boil and skim it, pour

i'ttover the pickles when cold a,nd then press them down 
with a plate weighted with a stone, tie a cloth over 
them and set aside in a cool, airy place. 

56. Cucumbers pickled in Vinegar and Water. For 

each 2 quarts of vinegar take 1 quart of fresh water, 
1 cupful of salt and the spices as given in the above 
receipt. 

Take nice, fresh cucumbers having small seedsj and 
leave them in fresh water for 12 hours. Then dry them 
in a cloth, put them into a stone jar with the spices, 
dissolve the salt in water, pour this, with the vinegar, 
over the pickles, which must be covered with plenty of 
the brine, put a mustard seed bag over them and cover 
as in the preceding receipt. 

Remark.— Cucumbers pickled in this way taste very nicely and keep for a 
long time. They are excellent for Cucumber Salad (Division Q). 

57. Russian Cucumbers. 30 large cucumbers with- 
out seeds, 1 pound of eschalots, 2 ounces of mustard 
seeds, 1 ounce of garlic, 1 handful of fine sweet basil, 
dill and tarragon, 1 red pepper, fresh if possible, other- 
wise use a dried pod. 

Wash the cucumbers, salt them thoroughly and let 
them stand for 48 hours. After they are washed and 
drained, dry and lay them side by side into a jar and 
cover with the above-named spices. Then boil as much 
vinegar as will cover the cucumbers and pour the boil- 
ing vinegar slowly over them. After about two weeks 
boil the vinegar and pour it cold over the pickles, 
which can be used after about six weeks. 

58. Boiled Russian Pickles. For 2 quarts of wine 
vinegar take % ounce of pepper and % ounce of cloves; 
for between the pickles, % pound of eschalots or small 
onions, % pound of sliced horseradish, % pound of must- 
ard seeds, 1 ounce of garlic, M ounce of bay leaves and 
a couple of handfuls of dill. 

-Take cucumbers of medium size, wash and then 
sprinkle plenty of salt over them and set aside for 24 
hours. After this rinse off in the brine and wipe dry. 
In the meantime boil as much wine vinegar as will cover 
the pickles and add the cloves and pepper. When the 
vinegar boils, pour in part of the cucumbers, let them 
cook through, take out with a skimmer, throw in the 



Pickled Vegetables. 433 

others and put into the jar in layers with the spices and 
pour the hot vinegar over them. If after a few days 
they are not wholly covered with the vinegar add cold 
vinegar. The cucumbers can also be peeled and pre- 
pared in this way ; both kinds will keep for a long tame. 

59. Mustard Pickles. For a 5-quart jar take % 
pound of salt, % pound of eschalots, M pound of horse- 
radish, % pound of mustard seeds, 1 ounce of ginger, 
% ounce of pepper, % ounce of cloves (taking off the 
heads), bay leaves and two handfuls of dill. 

Cucumbers which have turned yellow are the best, 
because they are not so apt to get soft. Peel, cut in 
two lengthwise, take out the seeds with a silver spoon, 
strew over them the salt and set aside over night. After 
they are drained, cut them into pieces two inches long 
and one inch wide, put into a jar and pour cold wine 
vinegar over them. After a week or a fortnight boil the 
vinegar and skim it, lay the cucumbers into the jar in 
layers with the spices and pour the cpld vinegar over 
them (the vinegar must cover the pickles), lay a must- 
ard bag over them, over this a plate weighted with ii 
stone, and tie a cloth over the top. 

60. Samba. Peel large cucumbers, finely slice them 
lengthwise (to the seeds), let them lay in saltfor 3^hours, 
then putthem into a scalded bag and hang up to drain. 
When they are dry put them into glasses in layers with 
mace, white peppercorns and some eschalots, and pour 
over them vinegar which was boiled and then cooled. 
A nice way to serve this is with small pickled onions, 
heaping them in the center of the dish and putting a 
wreath of the Samba around them. 

Excellent with beef or mixed with herring salad. 

61. Preserved Cucumber Salad. Half ripe peeled 
cucumbers are sliced as for salad, salted and then put 
on a sieve to drain, after which put them into a dish 
with wine vinegar to draw out the salt. Then lay a 
cloth into the sieve, pour the cucumbers into this, press 
out well, fill into a glass with onions and ground pep- 
per, pour cold vinegar over them and at last add some 
saiad oil. 



U. — Dried and Pickled 
Vegetables. 



1. Pickling in Kegs and Stone Jars. The kegs 
should be carefully cleaned with a whisk broom and 
then filled with cold water, which must be renewed a few 
times during the week. Then SGrub them thoroughly, 
scald with hot water, let them dry in the air and put 
them into the cellar, slightly raised from the floor. Be- 
fore putting in I he vegetables the kegs should be scalded 
again. Vegetables scalded beforethey are pickled should 
receive the scalding in a copper kettle, which will give 
them a nice green color, and this is not by any means 
deleterious, if the vegetables are not allowed to remain 
in the kettle after they are scalded, but are at once 
taken out and the water is changed. Should you, never- 
theless, feel any hesitancy about using a copper kettle, 
take "nickel or enameled ware, adding a little piece of 
alum to the water, which will also give the vegetables a 
fresh green color. After the vegetables are pickled, they 
should be covered with, a linen cloth, putting some 
horseradish leaves or grape leaves on top of this; at 
last put in a plate large enough to cover the entire 
upper surface and weight it down sufficiently to bring 
the vegetables under the liquor, but not enough to 
press them. , Clean the keg once a week, washing out 
the cloth every time. Be careful that there is always 
sufficient liquor to cover the vegetables, and if there 
should not be enough, pour in some (cooled) boiled 
water after each cleaning. 

If the vegetables \vere allowed to stand dry, care- 
fully remove all that may have spoiled before adding 
any water as above, running the fingers around the 



U.— Dried and Pickled Vegetables. 435 

edges, taking up all that may have become soft. Wipe 
the interior of the keg with a* clean cloth, rinse the cloth 
in fresh water and repeat this until the keg is entirely 
clean. Then pour the liquor into the center of the vege- 
tables, rinse the top cloth and put it on again together 
with some fresh leaves, and weight it down with the 
clean plate and stone. 

When taking out any of the vegetables, gather the 
cloth all around and lift it out carefully so that none of 
the scum which has gathered on it will drop into the 
keg. Press the vegetables, being cautious not to do 
this over the keg, rinse the top cloth, the plate and the 
stones, and put them back as before. In this manner 
the vegetables will remain sweet and wholesome. 

2. Salted Green Peas. Fill 3 parts of green peas 
and 1 part of salt into a small, clean, scalded linen bag; 
dry the bag after it is scalded. Tie the bag securely, 
put it into a stone jar and weight it with a wine bottle 
filled with water. 

To prepare the peas for the table take them out of 
the salt and cover with boiling water, which is poured 
off after the elapse of half an hour. Eepeat this three 
times, then put the peas into boiling water with small 
carrots cut into cubes, and a piece of butter. Cook 
until tender, which will take about 1% hours. When 
done, stir through it a finely rolled cracker, some sugar 
and finely chopped parsley. Send to the table at once, 
because the dish will lose its flavor if allowed to stand 
for any length of time. 

3. Dried Green Peas. ' For this purpose take early 
marrow-fat peas, shell them and scald in boiling water 
for 5 minutes, after which spread them out on cloths to 
dry. Then put them on frames covered with clean 
white paper and dry them slowly in a slightly heated 
oven. Fill them into paper bags and hang in a dry, 
airy place. When preparing them for the table, let 
them stand over night, and parboil them the next day. 
Then put a piece of butter and a little sugar into water 
and bring it to a boil, cook the peas in this until tender 
and serve after adding the necessary salt, parsley, some 
sugar and another piece of butter rubbed in flour. 



436 IT.— Dried and Pickled Vegetables. 

4. Salted Beans. Shell the beans and follow direc- 
tions for salted peas. When preparing for the table it 
is best to first rinse the beans thoroughly in lukewarm 
water, then bring to a boil in hot water after which let 
them stand in hot water for a while longer. Boil in 
bouillon until tender and finish in the same manner as 
fresh vegetables. 

5. String Beans Salted. For each 100 pounds of 
shredded beans take 7% pounds of salt, which is partly 
sprinkled and stirred through the beans. - Let the beans 
remain in the vessel over night and fill them into the 
keg without the liquor the next morning. Enough 
liquor will still appear to cover the tops of the beans. 
After three or four weeks take off the scum and, if neces- 
sary, pour in some boiled brine. Cover and weight the 
beans as directed in No. 1. 

Remark. — The evening before the beans are to be cooked put them on the 
fire in cold water, cook for 1 hour and let them remain over night in fresh, cold 
water. The next morning rinse them carefully and put them on the Are in water 
with a piece of butter, to simmer. They will be done in an hour and' taste very 
nicely. ' 

6. String Beans salted after parboiling. Wash the 
beans, shred them, bring to a boil in a copper or nickel 
kettle, leaving them in the kettle for a few minutes only, 
even if they do not become entirely tender. Pour into a 
basket or colander and drench with plenty of cold water 
until cold. Put a thin layer of salt into the bottom of 
the keg and press every lot of parboiled beans into the 
keg, using fresh water fqr parboiling each succeeding 
layer. When all of the beans have been packed into the 
keg, sprinkle some salt over s the top and cover with 
cold water; put a weight on them not any heavier than 
enough to hold them down. After a while a heavier 
weight may be used. After a fortnight pour off the 
liquor and replenish with cold water, repeating this 
from time to time, say about once in two weeks. 

Beans salted as above directed will have a very nice 
color, need no further salting, will cook tender in a 
short time, have no unpleasant odor and in flavor are 
almost equal to beans brought in from the garden. 

7. Salted Small Salad. Beans. Take 3 pounds of 
salt for each 30 pounds of beans, string the beans, wash 
them, throw on a sieve, sprinkle the salt through them 



U.— Dried and Pickled Vegetables. < 437 

and let them stand in a clean keg over night. The next 
day mix them thoroughly, press tightly into the keg 
and cover as directed in the preceding receipts. Kemove 
the scum with great care. Jf the beans should not be 
covered with liquor pour in some cold brine. 

8. Salad Beans in Brine. Boil the beans, either 
whole or broken in two, until nearly tender, and when 
cold press them into a keg; prepare a brine strong 
enough to bear an egg, taking about 3 pounds of salt 
to 6 quarts of water, and when cold pour it over the 
beans. This quantity will be sufficient to cover, about 
17 quarts. Cover the keg as directed in No. 1. 

9. Salad Beans in Vinegar. 2 quarts of wine vin- 
egar, 1 quart of fresh water, a handful of salt, plenty of 
horseradish, or else. some dry ginger, bay leaves, pepper, 
ground cloves. 

The beans, which can be of any size desired, are 

[carefully cleaned, string and throw part of them into 
a copper kettle containing boiling hot water; leave the 
beans in the water for ten minutes only, otherwise they 
will become soft and are apt to spoil. Spread them 
apart to dry, but this should not be done in the open 
air, otherwise they will lose their natural color. Press 
them in layers into a jar with the spices, dissolve the 
salt in water, and pour this over the beans with the 
vinegar. The beans should be fully covered, put on top 
a bag containing mustard seeds large enough to cover 
the entire surface of the beans, add the weight, close the 
jar tightly and set it aside in ah airy cool place. 

Remark.— The beans are served as a salad with oil and -vinegar, or after 
being parboiled,, or as a vegetable with an egg sauce, after they have simmered 
sufficiently. 

jb > 10. White Cabbage. For about 9 gallons, take 
about two dozen medium-sized firm heads ; if the cab- 
bage is to be shredded very finely 30—34 firm heads 
will be necessary. Winter cabbage should never be 
selected for pickling becauseit is tough and has a strong 
taste. The cabbage should be shredded as soon as pos- 
sible after being cut from the stalk because it is -then 
the juiciest ; cover the bottom of the keg with some salt 
and put in the cabbage ift thin layers without any salt, 
pressing it in quite compactly. Cleaning and covering 
the keg, etc., should be done as given in No. 1. 



438 TL— Dried and Pickled Vegetables. 

1 1 . Salted Endives. 'For this purpose take only the 
smooth yellowed Summer endives. After removing the 
yellow leaves from the stalks, wash and then cut them 
into rather short lengths. Wash again and set aside 
to drain. After this put them into a clean keg or stone 
jar with plenty of salt, and cover with a rather heavy 
weight. 

Remark.— For the table the endives are parboiled, drained, well pressed, 
then stewed with butter, salt, some rolled cracker and a little nutmeg ; if desired, 
stir the yolk of an egg through it. 

12. Dried Butter Beans. For this purpose take the 
large, so-called butter beans, fully grown and tender, 
cut them into pieces about 2 inches in length and par- 
boil them for a few minutes, and slightly dry them in a 
moderately hot oven. They must retain a light green 
color and remain tough, consequently should not break. 

13. Dried Salad Beans. Take small sized beans, 
not too early, at all events not before small beans have 
begun to form in the pods. Carefully string them, 
bring to a boil once and let them dry carefully, not too 
slowly, nor too quickly. The beans should be tough 
and not brittle. The stringing is most readily done 
after the beans are taken from the fire. To prepare 
them for the table, soak them over night in cold water 
and renew this the next morning. Put the beans on the 
fire in cold water and when tender, which will be after 
the elapse of 1 — 2 hours, they are finished in the same 
manner as fresh beans.

I. BEVERAGES. 

1. The Various Kinds of Coffee, Directions for Roast- 
ing, etc. Coffee to be good should be roasted at homo. 
It must be carefully browned, for when too brown, the 
coffee wil l be bitter, a nd if no t roast e dJ5foTi p1' r i * will - 
ha ve an insipid taste? The cylinder inwhich the coffee 
is roasted snouid oe only half filled, turn it slowly over 
a moderate fire until it emits a strong aroma. After 
this the turning should be done quicker, because the 
berries arethen heated through and they will bebrowned 
too much if slowly finished. vVhen the coffee has a uni- 
form light brown color, w hich can be ascertained by 
opening the slide Irftne cylinder, spread it quickly on a 
flat dish and cover with a cloth. When cold, put the 
coffee into canisters or bottles and close tightly, so that 
it will not lose its aroma ; for this reason it is best not 
to roast too large a quantity at a time. 

2. To Prepare Coffee. For a strong cup of coffee, 
take about % ounce for each person. Put boiling water 
into the pot and set it on the top of the hot stove before 
putting in the coffee, which should not be ground too 
soon beforehand. Then pour in the necessary quantity 
of boiling water, take a few cupfuls out of the pot and 
immediately pour them back. Then put the pot on the 
top of the hot stove again until the coffee bubbles. 
After the coffee has settled it can be poured into another 
pot if desired. Coffee should never, under any circum- 
stances, draw too long. The coffee can be improved if it 
is put into a perforated coffee funnel and then gradually 
pour boiling water over it. 



440 V.— Beverages, Cordials, Etc. 

It will be found advantageous to put a conical bag, 
so made that it will nicely fit on the inside of the funnel,' 
to hold the coffee. It will strain better and clearer. 

It is perhaps unnecessary to state that the milk 
served with the coffee should be of the very best. When 
cream can be obtained it is of course preferable to milk, 
and will make the coffee ever so much the better. 

3. Tea. Formerly green and black teas mixed were 
much in vogue, but' the black varieties are receiving 
greater favor at present, largely because the green teas 
are more injurious to health. . Tea should always ae 
kept in tightly closed canisters, and the latter will pre-^ 
serve the flavor of the tea ever so much better if they 
are first scalded with an inf usiqnjjf . tea, letting itcgoJL 

in the canister. _~*-^ — """*"* "*" """" 

^ Tne teapot' sHouTdnrst be rinsed with boiling waterj 
then put it on top of the hot stove, filled with boiling 
water. As soon as the pot is very hot, pour out the 
water and put in the tea — about 1 heaping teaspoonfifl 
for each person ; for, more people a proportionately less 
quantity can be taken. Add a small quantity of boiling 
water, let it draw for a while, fill the pot with boiling 
water, let it stand on the hot stove for a few minutes 
and then stir it with a teaspoon. 

Tea prepared in the manner here described will con^ 
tain considerable tannin and is nei ther well flavored 
nor p leasant to drink, but it is the usfiai rfietdod of pre- 
paring it and is therefore inserted in this place. The 
properway to prepare tea is to let it draw in the boiling 
water for not longer than % minute. The resulting 
golden, transparent, aromatic beverage contains the 
principal constituent part of tbetea— -thetheine— almost 
entirely in solution, and also the greater part of the 
ethereal oils, without the disagreeable tannic acid. 

4. Chocolate with flilk. As there are so many dif- 
ferent kinds of chocolate it will depend upon the quality 
how much to take. However, 2% ounces of sweet choc' 
olate to a quart, or % of an ounce to a cupful is the 
usual quantity. When using bitter chocolate take less. 
Put the chocolate on the fire, barely covered with water. 
After it is entirely dissolved, stir it until it is nicely 
smooth and then turn in the milk, which can be thinned, 



Beverages. *41 

taking about % part water. The chocolate will be more 
agreeable in taste and easier to digest than when made 
with pure milk. Then add the necessary sugar and boil 
for about 10 minute's, stirring constantly. 

5. Chocolate with Water. To 1 quart of water take 
]i pound of "chocolate, or % ounce for each cupful of 
water. Prepare the same as chocolate with milk, but it 
must (boil for 10 minutes on a good fire,' stirring, or, 
better still, twirling it, which will cause it to bind. 

6. Imperial Punch. 1 pineapple cut into very thin 
slices, 1 bottle of champagne, 1 bottle of Rhinewine, not 
quite 1 bottle of arrac, 1 quart of boiling water, about 
% pound of sugar with the peel of a lemon grated over 
it, if wished the fine peel of an orange, 4 oranges, the 
juice of 4 fresh lemons, a small teaspoonful of ground 
cinnamon and a little vanilla. Put the cinnamon into 
boiling water. to draw, pour through a fine sieve into 
the punch bowl, add sugar, lemon juice, the oranges 
peeled and divided, and the pineapple. When cold, pour 
in the Rhinewine, arrac and champagne and a dash of 
vanilla. 

7. Strawberry Punch. Mash 2 pounds of straw- 
berries in a stoneware- or glass vessel which can be 
tightly covered .ad d 1 battle of rum, and let the mixture 
stand' 2 — 3 days, stlrringit "occasion ally during this 
time. Then pour through a fine sieve into another 
vessel. The pujp of the strawberries is then also' rubbed 
through the sieve. This strawberry rum should be 
bottled, covering the corks with sealing wax, when it 
will keep for along time; the bottles must not stand, 
but lie on their sides. Should it jelly in the bottles, it 
can easily be shaken out and will readily dissolve when 
put into the boiling water. 

When making the punch take the juice of two good 
lemons without the seeds, according to taste 1 to 1% 
pounds of sugar, and nearly 3 quarts of water to a 
bottle of tbe strawberry rum. Put the sugar into the 
punch bowl, squeeze the lemon juice over it, pour in the 
rum, and finally the boiling water. When the punch is 
done, the bowl must be covered and set aside until cold ; 
it will taste better if made in the morning and served in 
the evening than when it is served immediately after it 



442 V.— Beverages, Cokdials, Etc. ' 

is made. The punch can also be filled into bottles, let 
them lay on their sides for a few days and it will then 
be much better. 

8. Holland Punch. 1 part of strained lemon juice, 
2 parts of pulverized sugar, 4 parts of arrac, all 
measured in a glass. Put this mixture into a small 
vessel, let it dissolve on the t fire and stir through it 
8 parts of boiliug water. 

9. Wine Punch. No. I. 6 bottles of wine are mixed 
with sugar, taking 3 to 4 ouuces to the bottle, heat

short time, but it must not boil. 

10. Wine Punch. No. 2. 1 bottle of Bordeaux, a 
little over 3 ounces of sugar, 2 bottles of water, % bottle 
of fine arrac and the juice of a lemon . Get the wine and 
sugar seething hot but do not let them boil. Add the 
boiling water and at last the arrac and the juice of a 

lemon. 

11. Wine Punch. No. 3. Heat 3 bottles of Bhine- 
wiue to the boiling point* then add 1 bottle of strong 
tea (using about % ounce of tea), also Vs pound of sugar 
on which grate the peel of a lemon, using the juice in 
the punch. After this mixture has been poured into the 
bowl, add about % — % quart of arrac, according to the 
strength desired . 

12. Polish Royal Punch. Grate % of a lemon and 
)i of an orange over a pound of sugar, cook this with 
% quart of water to a thin syrup, then add the juice of 
2 oranges and % of a lemon, 3 spoonfuls of pineapple 
syrup, y 2 bottfe of Chablis, the same quantity of Bhine- 
wine and Burgundy; let this all get very hot, but it 
must not boil. Then dip a piece of sugar into rum, 
lay it into a silver spoon, hold it over the punch and 
light it. As soon as the sugar burns, pour on more 
rum until % bottle has been poured into the punch' in 
this way: Then pour in % bottle of champagne and 
serve the punch. 

13. Mecklenburg Punch. For this punch take 1 
bottle of good tea, 4 bottles of good claret, 1 bottle of 



Beverages. 443 

Portwine, 1 bottle of cognac, % bottle of Madeira and 
2 pounds of sugar, grating the rind of 2 lemons on the 
sugar. 

14. American Punch. Cream the yolks of 6 eggs 
with % pound of sugar, add nearly 1 pint of arrac and 
stir lightly through this the beaten whites of the eg°:s. 
When all is stirred together, mix through it 1% quarts 
of whipped cream, and serve in punch glasses. 

15. Jenny Lind Punch. Grate the rind of % of an 
orange on % pound of s,ugar, then press out the juice of 
2 oranges aud melt the sugarwith the juice. Then po^r 
onto this 2 bottles of Rhinewine and heat the punch 
until it is at the boiling point. Then let it cool, add a 
little vanilla, and at last % bottle of Madeira; put the 
punch on ice until wanted to serve. 

16. New Year's Eve ("Sylvester") Punch. This 
punch is to be prepared the last morning in the year, so 
that it can be served cold, which adds greatly to its 
taste. Scald % ounce, of black tea for % minute in hot 
water, in a closely covered djsh. Melt 1% pounds of 
sugar in )i quart of water, add the peel of % of a lemon, 
some vanilla and % ounce of dried orange blossoms, add

% quart of water and the juice of 1 lemon and 2 oranges, 
pour in % bottle of Rhinewine, % cupful of arrac, % cup- 
ful of Marascino, and % bottle of champagne. Put this 
into a freezer and turn it constantly until it freezes. 
About % hour before serving, stir through it the beaten 
whites of 4 eggs, (i/ B pound of sugar seasoned with 
vanilla having first been stirred into the beaten whites 
of the eggs), let it freeze for % hour longer, and serve 
the punch, which must be as white and creamy as thick 
cream, in champagne glasses. 



444 V.— Beverages, Cordials, Etc. 

. 18. Egg Punch. 1% bottles of good French wine, 
% quart of boiling- water, % pound of sugar, grate the 
rind of 1 lemon on the sugar and use the juice of 2 
lemons, some tea, nutmeg and a few cloves, 8 fresh eggs, 
and some arrac. 

Let the spices draw in the boiling water, take them 
out, add the other ingredients and whip on the stove 
over a good fire until the cream rises, but it must not 
boil. Then take from the stove, whip for a while longer, 
and add a little arrac according to taste. 

19. Ice Punch. Grate the* rind of 1 lemon on 1 
pound of sugar, put on the stove with a little water, to 
which add the juice of 2 lemons, and when it boils, 
skim. After it has cooled, add the juice of 6 oranges. 
Put into a freezer; after it is frozen quite thick add 
1 bottle of champagne, 1 glassful of arrac and % glass- 
fp'. of Jamaica rum. 

20. Hulled Wine. For 4 bottles of claret, take 1 
pound of sugar, 1 ounce of cinnamon broken into pieces, 
also a few cloves ; if after the wine* is mulled it is not 
sweet enough, more sugar can be added. Put the mix- 
ture on the fire in a covered stone jar and pour it into 
a bowl while boiling hot. 

21. Hot Egg Punch. To each pint of white wine 
take 1 fresh egg and 1% ounces of sugar. Beat this 
on a quick fire until it is quite hot; it must not boil, 
otherwise it will curdle. 

22. Cold Egg Punch. A refreshing beverage. For 
1 pint of white wine or claret take the yolks of 2 very 
fresh eggs, beat with pulverized sugar and grated hut- 
meg and then gradually add the wine. 

23. Bishop. For 1 bottle of claret take the thinly 

peeled rind of an orange and 3 ounces of sugar. The 

peel must be removed in about 10 minutes. 

t: 

24. Punch Extract. 1% pounds of sugar, the juice 
of four fresh lemons, 1 bottle of arrac. Boil the sugar 
in 1% cupfuls of water, add the juice of the lemons, and 
after it has cooled, add the arrac. When using take 1 
pai"t of the extract to 2 parts of boiling water. 



Beverages. 445 

25. Parisian Cardinal Extract. 4 /s quart of arrac, the 
rind of 4 oranges, 2 ounces of cinnamon, and vanilla. 

Break the cinnamon into small pieces, peel the 
oranges thinly, cut into small pieces, mix with the arrac, 
add vanilla, put into a covered vessel and shake often. 
Filter through blotting paper, and then bottle. 

For every bottle of Rhinewine take about 2 table- 
spoonfuls of the extract, and sweeten with 3 to 4 ounces 
of sugar. 

26. Bowl=Cups. For the preparation of all kinds of 
bowl-cups it is desirable to add a bottle of the heavier 
varieties of Rhinewine to the light Moselle or Rhine- 
wines used. The beverage will not thereby become too 
strong,' but will gain very much in flavor. When using 
preserved fruits, only half of the quantity of sugar given 
in the various receipts should be used. The sugar easily 
dissolves in the water with which it is moistened before 
'the addition of the wine, but a. prepared sugar syrup is 
preferable. Sugar syrup can be prepared by bringing 
about 2% pounds of sugar to boil in 1 pint of water, let 
it boil for 5 minutes and strain through a scalded, 
rinsed and dried napkin into little bottles, where it 
will keep for a long time if well corked. When conven- 
ient, prepare the bowl several hours before it is sent 
to the table, cover tightly and set in a cold place, if 
possible on ice. 

The use of claret does not improve the flavor of the 
beverage but will give it a pretty color. Appolinaris 
or selters water is also not to be recommended on 
account of the salts it contains in solution ; if the bever- 
age is not to be strong, use carbonated water to dilute 
it. Bowl-cups that are to be entirely agreeable should 
never contain any rum, arrac, cognac and the like. If 
champagne or sparkling Rhinewine is to be added, it 
should be poured into the bowl just before it is brought 
to the table. 

27. Pineapple Cup. Thinly peel the pineapple and 
cut into fine slices, and according to the size of the fruit 
take 8—12 bottles of Rhine- or Moselle wine and 1 
bottle of claret, and sweeten according to taste; for 
1 bottle of wine take about 3 — 4 ounces of sugar. 



446 V.— Beverages, Cordials, Etc. , 

Sprinkle the sugar over the pineapple in layers, 
pour over it a glassful of Madeira or" water, and set 
aside for 24 hours. Then lay them into a bowl and 
add the wine aud the remaining sugar. "When using 
preserved pineapple, pour over it a bottle of wine 10— 12 
hours before serving. 

28. Orange Cup. Take 1—2 oranges, 6 bottles of 
Ehine- or Moselle wine, 1 bottle of Burgundy or claret, 
according to taste % bottle of carbonated water, and 
2 ounces or so of sugar to each bottlef ul of wine. 

Thinly pare the oranges with a thin knife, put the 
peel into a wineglass which was half filled with water, 
cover with paper and set aside for a few moments to 
draw. The given quantity of sugar syrup is put into 
a bowl, add the wine and the extract of the orange peel 
according to taste ; a bottle of Burgundy will improve 
the flavor of the bowl-cup. 

29. Peach Bowl-Cup. After skinning the peaches, 
cut them into thin slices, sprinkle with sugar, and if 
possible set aside in a covered dish for a few nours or a 
day to draw, and then proceed as given for strawberry 
bowl-cup. 

30. Strawberry Bowl-Cup. Take 1 heaping plate- 
ful of fresh strawberries — wild strawberries are prefer- 
able if they can be obtained — put them into a bowl, 
sprinkle % to 1 pound of sugar through them, add a 
trifle of water, and shake a little so that the sugar will 
mix through the berries. Set the bowl aside for 6 to 8 
hours, cover tightly and then pour in 6 to 8 bottles of 
Moselle wine. • 

31. Champagne Bowl-Cup. Dissolve 1 pound of 
sugar in 2 bottles of Moselle wine, 1 bottle of Burgundy 
and 2 bottles of champagne or sparkling Rhinewine, 
and set the bowl aside on ice until wanted. 

32. May Wine. Take fresh woodruf ("Waldmei- 
ster") before it blossoms (in April or May), pick it over 
carefully, remove the lower leaves a,nd lower parts of 
the stalks. Just before using rinse it quickly in water, 
put it into a bowl containing sugar previously dissolved 
— about 2 to 3 ounces of sugar for each bottle of wine. 
Pour in as much Rhine- or Moselle wine as desired. The 



Bevekages. 447 

herbs must be taken out of the bowl after a few minutes, 
otherwise they will flavor the beverage too strongly. 
Sliced oranges with the seeds removed are a pleasing 
addition to May wine. 

May wine when filled into bottles will keep for a few 
days, but great caution must be exercised, so that not 
the least bit of the herbs comes into the bottle: 

Or the " Waldmeister" can be covered with a bottle 
of wine, letting it draw for 10 to 15 minutes. This , 
extract can be filled into bottleaand then is used in the 
above beverage according to taste. 

In the months of July, August and September make 
a bowl-cup of mignonette-heads, taking about 15 heads 
for each bottle of wine with \ pound of sugar, letting 
the flowers draw in the wine somewhat longer than 
"Waldmeister." 

Remark.— The "Waldmeister" will gaim in flavor rery materially if It is not 
allowed to stand in water, but let it wilt in a cool place the day before using. 
The stalks of the herbs should not come into the wine j tie a bunch of the "Wald- 
meister" together wiih a cord and let only the heads of the bunch hang into 
the wine. 

33. Apple Bowl-Cup. Select good dessert apples, 
pare, core and slice them. Pour 2 glassfuls of sugar 
syrup over .the apple slices, cover and set aside for a

into glasses and serve while hot. 

35. Grog. To each part of arrac or rum and sugar, 
add according to taste 3 — 4 parts of boiling water. 

An excellent grog, which will also prove very palat- 
able in cold weather to ladies, is made of genuine old 
Jamaica rum with plenty of sugar and boiling -water, 
taking 4 — 5 times as much water as rum. 

36. Warm Cream Bowl-Cup ("Hoppelpoppel.") Take

sage meat without fat, season with salt, pepper, ground 
cloves and cardamom, a little pepper and finely ground 
majoram ; if liked, garlic may be used in this sausage. 
Add one part of rinds boiled until tender and chopped 
fine, 1 soup ladleful of blood, 2 pork tongues boiled 
until tender. , This is all mixed together, and if neces- 
sary add a little more seasoning and then fill into a 
case. Let this boil slowly for 2 hours in slightly salted 
water or else boil in some broth, press over night and , 
smoke for 2 to 3 weeks. ( 

Can be served cold with bread and butter, also 
warmed with potato salad. 

2. Bremen "Pinkel" Sausage. Mix with some finely 
whopped beef kidney suet the same quantity of oatmeal, 
add salt, pepper, cloves, ground cloves and plenty of 
finely chopped onions, fill into cases — leaving room for 
the oatmeal to swell — and then smoke. This sausage is 
cooked in brown cabbage, also in bean soup. 

3. Panhas. The panhas is best when half beef and 
half rather fat pork is used ; but it can be made just as 
well when either kind of meat is used alone. Boil the 
meat until tender, cut it into pieces and chop fine after 
taking out all the bones, and then bring it to a boil with 
the broth, which is passed through a sieve. Season with 
salt, pepper and cloves, and then add sufficient buck- 
wheat flour (about 2 pounds for 2 pounds of meat) 



W.— Pressed and Smoked Meats, Etc. 455 

constantly stirring, so that after the panhas has cooked 
for % to % hour it will be thick and not adhere to the 
sides of the kettle. Then put into clean and dried 
earthenware dishes and set aside in a cool and airy 
place. To fry the panhas proceed as given under Meats 
(Division D, No. "57). 

4. Sour Beef Rolls. 10 pounds of beef, 4% ounces 
of fine salt, % ounce of pepper and % ounce of cloves.

all the skin, mix and sprinkle the spices mentioned 
through the meat. Carefully clean and rinse a beef 
stomach, cut it into large, oblong pieces, put the meat 
on these and sew them closely, so that the strength of 
the meat and spices will not be lost, but they should 
not be filled too tightly, else they will burst. Then 
cover the rolls with plenty of water, add some salt, put 
on the fire, boil and skim for about 3—4 hours, or until 
the rolls can be easily pierced with a straw. Take the 
rolls out of the broth, mix some of the latter with sharp 
vinegar, and pour enough of this broth over the rolls 
after they are cold to cover them. 

5. Pork Rolls in Jelly. The rind of the pork is 
loosened from the fat, leaving a little of the latter on 
the rind and then cut into pieces 2 inches wide and 
6 inches long, also cut up some thin slices of lean pork 
of the same size. Lay the latter on the rinds, sprinkle 
with pepper and finely chopped lemon peel, roll tnem up 
tightly and tie with a thread. Put them into an enam- 
eled kettle with a few pigs' feet, knuckles and a small 
piece of beef, cover with vinegar and water half and 
half, add a few bay leaves, peppercorns, cloves and a 
piece of lemon peel, and cook until tender, skimming 
carefully. Then put the meat into a jar, pour the broth 
through a sieve into another vessel and after it has 
settled pour over the rolls. The latter are sent to the 
table sliced and dotted with meat jelly. Serve cold with 
bread and butter or salads. The jelly in which the rolls 
lay can also be utilized in a sauce for cold chicken or 
grouse. 

6. Jellied Pork. No. 1. Put the nose, feet, ears 
and knuckle of a pig on the fire in an enameled kettle 
with 1% pounds of lean beef, salt, 1 quart of wine vinegar 



456 W.— Pressed and Smoked. Meats, Etc. 

and enough water so that all of the scum can be taken 
off; add a few bay leaves, plenty of peppercorns and 
ground cloves, and cook until the meat is so tender'that 
it will drop from the bones. Pour the broth through a 
fine sieve and let it stand until the next day. Remove 
the bones from the meat, and when the latter is quite 
cold, cut it into narrow slices; do not take any of the 
beef. The next day remove the fat and settlings from 
the jelly, put it on the Are with the sliced meat and a 
sliced lemon without theseeds,let it cook for 15 minutes 
and then fill into dishes or moulds that have first been 
rinsed with cold water. The jelly should be set aside, 
uncovered, in an airy place. When preparing the jelly 
for the table scrape off the fat with a knife and turn the 
jelly on a dish, serving it with boiled potatoes, bread 
and butter or salads. It will keep fresh for several weeks 
and is a handsome, refreshing and palatable addition 
to the table. 

7. Jellied Pork. No. 2. Take the ears and the 
front feet and if wished part of the head, removing the 
fat, clean all very carefully" and put on the fire with 
plenty of water and salt.. After skimming, add pepper- 
corns, cloves, ground cloves and a few bay leaves, and 
let the meat cook thoroughly until tender. Then take 
out the bones, cut the meal: into long thin slices and 
pour the broth through a sieve after it is cold, take off 
the fat and put it on the fire with the meat, add a little 
grated lemon peel and ground cloves, and boil. After it 
has been boiled sufficiently pour into a dish of mould 
to cool. 

8. Jellied Pork No. 3. To 2 pounds of pork from 
the head add 3 cleaned calves' feet, and cook in salted 
water until tender. The broth must not be too thin 
and is cooked with whole onions, cloves, pepper and 
lemon peel, a few bay leaves and a cupful Of sharp 
vinegar for a while, and then poured through a sieve. 
In the meantime cut the meat into cubes, add the broth 
poured from the settlings, also the juice of a lemon, and 
boil thoroughly. Rinse a mould of deep dish with cold 
water so that the jelly will come out easier, ornament 
with lemon slices, carefully pour in the mass and pro- 
ceed as directed in the above receipt.

9. Jellied Spare Ribs. Crack the ribs in two ia the 
middle and then cut so that the ribs remain together 
two by two. They are cooked in water and vinegar 
half and half, with some pigs' feet, and skimmed. Then 
add lemon peel, plenty of whole pepper, 1—2 onions, 
salt, cloves, a few bay leaves and cook the meat until 
tender. Pour the broth through a sieve and after it 
has settled pour it over the meat into a porcelain dish. 
The ribs are served with some of the jelly in which they

Cook until the meat is tender, take it from the 
bones and cut it into slices. After the rinds have be- 
come tender put them into a clean, wet cloth, cover the 
rinds with sliced beets and the meat alternately, then 
cover the top with another rind, tie the cloth tightly, 
press with a little slab and some weights and pour the 
broth through a fine sieve. The day following cut the 
headcheese into slices, put them into a dish, remove 
the fat and settlings from the jellied broth, then add 
the meat. 

11. Headcheese. No. 2. Split the head of a young 
pig, clean carefully and boil until tender in water and 
vinegar, half and half, with the tongue and a few pigs' 
feet, salt, onions and spices. When tender put it on a 
slab, take the meat with the rind from the bones and 
lay the rind on a scalded but still wet napkin, keeping 
the rind whole. Take all sinews and gristle out of the 
meat and cut the latter into strips, also the tongue. 
Pjit the tongue and meat on the napkin in layers, 
sprinkle with pepper, a very little salt, thyme and cloves, 
fold the napkin closely around the meat, tie in a roll and 
cook this in the broth for %— 1 hour. After taking the 
headcheese from the broth, let it cool, press between 



458 _ W.— Pressed and Smoked Meats, Etc. 

two slabs, and the following day take off the napkin. 
Serve in slices with jelly or Kemoulade sauce. 

The broth in which the headcheese was cooked is 
poured through a sieve, freed from settlings^ adding a 
little salt if necessary, and then use as jelly. 

12. Smoked Breast of Qoose. When smoking goose 
breast use only the breasts of fat, large geese. After 
the breast is loosened from the breast bone cut off the 
legs at the first joint, salt the breast and legs, nib with 
a little saltpeter 'and after 3 days smoke them. 

They must not smoke longer than a week, and dur- 
ing this time they should have more air than smoke.- 

They are cut into thin slices with their fat and 
served raw with bread and butter. 

13. Smoked Geese in Pommeranian Style. Well 
fatted young geese are the best for this purpose. After 
they are thoroughly cleaned cut off the feet, neck and 
Wings. Divide them in two lengthwise in the middle, 
rub with saltpeter and a little salt, pack them tightly 
into a small clean cask, and cover. Let them lay in this 
for not longer than 8 days. Then take them out and 
sprinkle thickly with wheatbran, being careful not to 
lose any of the moisture or the salt adhering to the 
meat ; turn the meat in the bran so that all of it and 
the fat will be completely covered. Then smoke them, 
being careful that , the pieces do not touch one another, 
neither must the heat from the fire affect them in any 
way. After theelapseof about a week take the meat out 
of the smoke, hang it in a cool place and after a short 
time wipe off all of the bran with a dry linen cloth. 

Geese smoked in this way will have a very good 
color and keep for a long time. 



Z. — Fruit Wine and Vinegar. 



1. Apple Wine. (Cider). When preparing fruit 
wines, great care and cleanliness are necessary. All the 
utensils, such as tubs, casks, ladles, funnels, etc., should 
be of wood, stoneware or glass, because the acids cor- 
rode iron easily, and they should never be used for any 
other purpose. 

The fruit used in making wine must be ripe, but per- 
fectly sound, tart and of fine quality. Sweet apples are 
not good for wine. The apples can be of mixed varieties, 
and juicy pears may also be mixed with them. About 
1% cwt. of fruit will make in the neighborhood of 10 
gallons of wine. After all of the vessels used for ferment- 
ing have been thoroughly cleaned, wash the fruit care- 
fully and throw it into baskets to drain. Pick over the 
apples, rejecting any that are wormy or not perfectly 
sound. Mash the apples with a pounder in a tub or 
heavy wooden trough. Do not take too many apples 
in the trough at once, for then they will nob mash easily. 
Then put the mashed apples into a vat, letting them 
stand until the next day, stirring occasionally so that 
the pulp will absorb some of the oxygen from the air. 
If there should only be fruit enough to make about 10 

fallons, the juice can be pressed through a loose linen 
ag ; for greater quantities a press will be found neces- 
sary. 

Let the juice run into a keg which has first been 
rinsed with hot and then with cold water. The pressed 
pulp should be broken up, moistened with warm water 
and then pressed again the following day. Both lots of 
Juice are mixed together, fill the keg and pour what is 
left of the juice into a keg. Put both keg and jug to 
ferment in a place having a temperature of about 25 to 
30 degrees. 



460 Z.— Fruit Wine and Vinegar. 

The opening of the keg and the mouth of the jug 
are lightly covered with* a little piece of linen cloth, 
simply to keep out insects; the froth arising through 
fermentation must be carefully removed every day and 
the cloths cleaned or replaced by new ones. When the 
temperature is too low, a week may elapse before fer- 
mentation begins, usually, however, it will begin in 
3—4 days. When the frothing stops, cover the opening 
in the cask with a small sandbag, which will be suf- 
ficiently tight, and then daily pour in some of the juice 
in the jug in order to keep the keg well filled. After fer- 
mentation is done close the cask tightly and replenish 
its contents every week with some of the juice contained 
in the jug, it being essential that the keg should be kept 
completely filled. In order that the juice injfche jug may 
not spoil, it should be filled into bottles, which are kept 
well corked and the juice used to keep the keg filled. 

After the elapse of about 8 to 10 weeks it will be 
advisable to change the cider into another keg. Filter 
the settlings or put them into bottles to clear. If there 
should not be enough juice to fill the keg, sweetened 
water must be added, but this ought not to occur 
because when pressing the first juice enough should be 
provided for replenishing purposes. , 

By Spring time the wine will be clear enough so that 
it can be filled into bottles, and is also fit for use, but if 
it can be kept until the Fall it will be. much finer in 
appearance and flavor. In the early Summer it will 
prove to be a delicious, wholesome and refreshing drink. 
It is of great importance that no brandy nor spirits of 
any kind be added; plenty of fruit of good quality is 
the prime factor in making fruit wines. 

2. Currant Wine. Currant-, gooseberry-, raspberry 
and huckleberry wines need plenty of sugar and the 
acidity of the currants must be reduced with water. 
Take the currants when ripe but not overripe, strip them 
from the stems and press out the juice, which is best 
done in a large bowl with a potato masher. For about 
10 gallons take 30 to 40 pounds of berries; the quantity 
need not be exact because there must be enough juice 
for replenishing purposes. The pressed berries are set 
aside for 2 to 3 days in an open stoneware jar or 
wooden vessel, and then press out the juice with either 



Z.— Fruit Wine and Vinegar. 461 

a fruitpress or with the hands through a coarse cloth 
bag. This juice may be thinned with water which has 
been on the currants over night and has run through 
the press clear. 

Toeach quart of the juice first pressed, add 2 quarts 
of the second pressing and 2 pounds of sugar, when 
all is well mixed put the juice into a clean cask and fill 
the surplus into a jug or bottles for replenishing pur- 
poses. Then put the juice into the cellar to ferment and 
proceed in other respects as directed in the foregoing 
. receipt. 

, A plentiful addition of sugar will make this a very 
fiery wine. Although fit for use after a twelve-month 
or so, this wine will be almost equal to Tokay if kept in 
the bin for 3 years, particularly so if white and black 
currants mixed were used in making it. 

3. Gooseberry Wine. Is made of fully rjpe berries; 
currants can also be mixed with them. Unripe berries 
may also be used, adding sugar and water as directed 
for currant wine. 

The water can be hot when poured on the pressed 
gooseberries and then proceed as previously directed. 
Gooseberry Avine will have a deliriously mild flavor if it 
is stored until the Fall before being bottled. Replenish- 
ing the contents of the keg with some of the surplus 
juice, tightly closing the cask after fermentation has 
ceased, and carefully corking the bottles are points 
which must be observed in order to be fully successful 
in making wine. ' 

4. Huckleberry Wine. The preparation is the same 
as directed for currant and gooseberry wine, but less 
sugar is necessary. If the wine is n ot wanted very sweet, 
add either a little currant juice or tartaric acid. 

5. Fruit Vinegar. The apples used to make the 
vinegar should be nicely w'ashed, all unsound parts cut 
away, mash them thoroughly, and press until the pulp 
is quite dry. The apples need not be entirely ripe and 
pears. may also be used; all blackened fruit should be 
rejected because it gives the vinegar a bitter taste. The 
fruit is put into open kegs for 8 to 10 days. All im- 
purities will rise to the top during the process of fermen- 
tation and must be carefully removed. After this run 



462 J.— Fruit Wine and Vinegar. 

the juice into casks, which should be half filled only in 
order that the air can act upon the juice, and then put 
the casks in a warm place. As soon as fermentation 
has entirely ceased, close the casks at the bung with a 
piece of linen of medium thickness and let them lay un- 
disturbed until the Spring, when the vinegar can be 
drawn into bottles. There will always be a thick 
sediment at the bottom of the cask. It is a favorable 
indication when a thick tough skin (mother-of-vinegar) 
forms on the surface, and this should by no means be 
disturbed before bottling. , 

6. Sugar Vinegar. For 6 bottles or 5 quarts of 
water take 1% pounds of sugar, boil for % hour, skim- 
ming carefully, and then pour it into an open keg. When 
cool throw in a slice of wheat-bread thickly spread with 
yeast. Let it ferment for 2 days and then add a' piece 
of mother-of-vinegar if you have it. 

Then pour the liquid into another keg, which should 
be put into a warm dry place. Close the bung with a 
piece of linen cloth, which should be perforated so that 
the air can easily enter the cask. If it is desired that 
the vinegar receive a nice Rhinewine color, add a quan- 
tity of primroses to the water and sugar at the begin- 
ning, and let them boil with the rest. 

7. Currant Vinegar. Press the berries, let the juice 
stand until the next day and when clear fill into bottles, 
being careful to keep back all of the settlings; then let 
the bottles stand open in the sun or other warm place 
and do not cOrk them until fermentation has entirely 
ceased. 



The American Kitchen. 

In this division, receipts are given for various dishes 
prepared in styles peculiar to cooking as done in the 
United States. 



SOUPS. 



1. Oyster Soup. 1 quart of sweet milk and 1 quart 
of oysters. Bring the juice of the oysters and the milk 
to a boil ; add a tablespoonf ul of butter, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Then add the oysters and bring to 
a boil again. Serve immediately. Too much boiling 
hardens the oysters. 

2. Lobster Chowder. Mix with % cup of butter 

3 crackers which were rolled fine, and the green fat of 
the lobster. Then boil 1 quart of milk. Season with a 
scant teaspoonful of salt, some white pepper and a 
saltspoonful of cayenne pepper. Pour the boiling milk 
gradually over the lobster paste. Put it into a double 
boiler, add the lobster meat cut into dice, let it come to 
a boil and serve. 

3. Clam Chowder. Boil 50 clams in their own 
juice for 3 minutes, strain and return the juice to the 
fire. Fry 1 onion in butter and cut a small piece of fat 
salt pork into dice and fry with the onion ; add($ table- 
spoonfuls of flour and stir well together. When well 
cooked add the clam juice* 1% cupfuls of cream, a little 
ground mace, a little thyme, cayenne, 8 ounces of pota- 
toes, and salt if necessary. When the potatoes are 
tender, add the clams, whole or cut into pieces, and 

4 ounces of biscuits cut into pieces and soaked inmilk. 
Boil until the clams are firm and serve in a deep dish or 
tureen. 



464 The American Kitchen. 

4. Corn Chowder. Scrape from the cob 1 quart of 
raw sweet corn. Put the cobs in water enough to cover 
them, boil for 20 minutes and skim them. Take 1 pint 
of pared sliced potatoes, soak and scald them. Fry an 
onion in a small piece of pork fat and strain the fat 
into the kettle with the corn water. Add the potatoes, 
corn, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 saltspoonful of white 
pepper, 1 pint of sliced tomatoes. Simmer for 15 min- 
utes, or until the corn and potatoes are tender, then 
add 1 large tablespoonful of butter and 1 pint of milk, 
and serve very hot with crisped crackers. 

5. riock=TurtIe Soup. Take 1 calf's head and wash 
thoroughly ; remove the brains and tongue, which keep 
for a separate dish. Put the head and 4 calf's feet into 
a soup kettle with cold water. Skim carefully, then 
add 2 carrots, a bunch of soup herbs, juice of a lemon, 
4 onions, salt and 2 celery stalks. When boiled for 
about 3 hours or until the" meat comes off the bones, 
take out the best parts and press. Take out all bones 
from the coarser meat and simmer for 3 hours ; when 
cold, strain and skim thoroughly. The next day cut the 
pressed meat into cubes, to garnish the soup. Flavor 
the soup with sherry and plenty of pepper and lemon 
juice. Simmer with meat for half an hour and serve. 

6. Fish Soup. Fry 4 sliced onions in salad oil for 
a few minutes or until they are light brown ; then add 
6 sliced tomatoes, 3 pints of water, parsley, thyme, 
3 bay leaves and savory, all tied in a bunch, pepper and 
salt, blending the flour with a little water. Boil for 
%hour; then put in the slices offish; as soon as they 
are firm remove the herbs and serve the soup wjth bits 
of bread. Curry powder may also be added if desired. 

7. Chicken Soup. Cut a grown chicken as for fry- 
ing; boil gently in 3 quarts of water and remove all 
scum carefully. To 2 quarts of soup use % pint of rice, 
a few sprigs of parsley, pepper and salt to taste. Boil 
until the chicken is tender. Then add % pint of sweet 
milk and 1 tablespoonful of arrow root stirred into a 
spoonful of butter. Old fowls when in good condition 
a^e best for soups. 



Soups. 465 

3. Milk Soup. 1 quart of milk, the yolks of 4 eggs, 
salt and sugar to taste, and small pieces of bread. 

Put the dried bread, cut into pieces, into the bot- 
tom of the tureen. Bring the milk to a boil, add sugar 
and salt. Kub the yolks of eggs with a very little 
milk or water. When the milk is boiling remove it from, 
the Are and stir in the yolks of eggs. Put on the back 
part of the stove where it will not boil, and stir for a 
few minutes or until it thickens. Pour over the dried 
crusts and cover. Set aside for about 5 minutes and 
then serve. If the soup is boiled after the eggs are 
added, it will curdle. 

9. Canned Tomato Soup. Stew 1 can of tomatoes 
until they are soft enough to strain, rub. all but the 
seeds through a strainer, add 1 teaspoonful of sugar, 
1 saltspoonful of pepper and 1 teaspoonful of salt, and 
add all to 1 quart of boiling stock. Serve with crou- 
tons. 

10. Mixed Vegetable Soup. Take 1 cupful each of 
chopped celery, onions, carrots and strained tomatoes, 
% cupful each of chopped cabbage, turnips, parsnips 
and 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley. If you have 
only a few of the vegetables, substitute macaroni, rice 
or pearl barley, using altogether about one-half the 
amount of vegetables that you have liquid. The vege- 
tables should all be chopped Aery finely and cabbage, 
cauliflower, parsley, potatoes, parsnips or onions must 
be parboiled for 5 minutes and carefully drained. Fry 
onions and carrots, then put all with 1 quart of boiling 
water and 1 quart of stock and let it simmer until 
tender. For seasoning add 1 teaspoonful of sugar, 
1 teaspoonful of salt, and 1 saltspoonful of pepper. 
Serve without straining. 



VEGETABLES. 

1. Potato Puffs. Put 2 cupfuls of cold mashed 
potatoes into the frying pan, adding the yolks of 2 
eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream and 1 tablespoonful of 
butter. Stir until well mixed and hot. Take from the 



466 The American Kitchen. 

fire and stirin carefully the beaten-whites of the eggs. 
Heap on a well-greased tin or in gem pans, and bake 
with a quick fire until well done. 

2. Potato Croquettes. Beat the yolks of 2 eggs to 
a cream and to this add 2 cupfuls of mashed potatoes, 
1 teaspOonful of grated onion, 1 teaspoonful of pow- 
dered majoram, 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
cayenne, 1 teaspoonful of salt, and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
cream. Put into a saucepan and stir until the mixture > 
leaves the sides of the kettle. When cold form into 
balls or long proquettes. Dip first into egg and then 
into bread crumbs, making them very smooth and even. 
Set aside in a cool place for 1 hour, then fry to a golden 
brown. The lard should be deep enough to cover them. 
When fried to a golden brown, dry in the oven. Serve 
as a garnish to meat of any kind or as a vegettable. 

3. Fried Potatoes. The potatoes must be raw, 
large, unblemished and of a good round shape,. First 
take off a thin paring of the skin. Then pare the whole 
potato round and round, (not too thin), till you have 
gone through it all, and nothing is left unpared but a 
little lump in the centre. Then put these continuous 
rings of potatoes into a frying-pan, in which is boiling 
plenty of fresh butter, or butter and lard mixed. Fry 
them brown and tender, and arrange them handsomely 
in a dish for breakfast. 

Another Way. Slice thin a sufficiency of fine raw 
potatoes and lay them into a pan of cold water to soak 
for an hour or more, Then pour off that water entirely 
and replace it with fresh. Let them remain in this for 
another hour, or till it is time to cook them. Put them 
into a frying pan that has in it plenty of fresh butter or 
lard, enough, while, frying, to keep the potatoes near 
the surface. Fry them till perfectly well done and tender. 

4. Cauliflower with White Sauce. Take off ttll 
outside leaves; wash thoroughly. Put in a bag and 
boil gently for half an hour in salted water. Pour over 
melted butter with a spoonful of cream, or make this 
white sauce: Cook together 1 ounce of flour and 2 
ounces of butter, add 1 pint of sweet cream or- milk, 
simmer for 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper.

5. Baked Beans. Anyone can have nice baked beans 
if he secures a bean pot and follows these directions : 
The large red kidney variety of beans is largely used, 
but the small white pea bean is more generally popular. 
1 quart of beans is sufficient when cooked for two 
meals.for an average family. They should be soaked in 
cold water for 1 an hour or so. Then salt and pepper 
should be added, together with % teaspoonful of must- 
ard and % teacupful of molasses. The molasses gives 
the beans a delicious flavor and at the same time it is 
not too pronounced, nor is it possible to detect the 
molasses. When the beans are in the pot, %— % pound 
of salt pork well streaked with lean should be placed 
on top, and then enough warm water poured into the 
pot to just cover the beans. 

Beans should be baked in an oven of even temper- 
ature for either a day or a night, or, in other words, 
about 12 hours. It is better to bake them in the day- 
time, for then they can receive more attention. As the 
water gradually evaporates more should be added from 
time to time, but care should be taken to keep the 
beans covered. This must be done until the beans are 
nearly ready to be taken out, when no more water 
should be added, so that they will not be so moist as to 
become mashed or broken. 

The pot can remain in the oven, where it will simply 
keep hot, for an indefinite time without injury. Beans 
should be served in a covered dilm. Beans that have 
been left over are delicious warmed up in a stewpan 
with a little water added, and many bean epicures think 
the more times beans are warmed over the better they 
are. 

Good, old-fashioned brown bread is the proper ac- 
companiment for baked beans, and it is as difficult to 
fetthe genuine article as it is to find good baked beans, 
[ere is a famous recipe for Boston brown bread of the 
proper kind : 1 cupful of rye or graham flour, 1 cupful 
of white flour, 2 cupfuls of Indian -meal, 1 cupful of 
molasses (scant), 2 teaspoonfuls of soda, % teaspoonful 
of salt, 1 cupful of sour milk and V/ 2 — 2% cupfuls of 
water. 

Steam for 3 hours and then dry in the oven for half 
an hour. The brown bread should be eaten warm and 
What is leftover can be either steamed again or toasted.

6. Winter Succotash. Wash 3' cupfuls of dried corn 
and 2 cupfuls of lima beans ; put the beans into a kettle 
and cover with cold water. Cover the corn with cold 
water and set on the back of the stove to heat and 
swell. Boil the beans for about 15 minutes, then drain 
off the water, pour boiling water on them and when 
tender add the corn, cooking both together for about 
15 minutes. Just before serving add a little salt, pepper 
and butter and flour rubbed together, or % teacupful of 
cream or milk thickened with a little flour. 

7. Summer Succotash. String % peck of young 
green beans, and cut each bean into three pieces (not 
more), and do not split them. Throw the beans into 
a pan of cold water, as you cut them. Have ready 
over the fire a pot or sauce-pan of boiling water ; put in 
the beans and boil them rapidlv for nearly 20 minutes. 
Afterwards take them up and drain them well through 
a colander. Take % dozen ears of young but full-grown 
Jndian corn, (or 8 — 9, if they are not all large) and cut 
the grains down from the cob. Mix together the corn 
and the beans, adding a very small teaspoonful of salt, 
and boil them about 20 minutes. Then take up the 
succotash, drain it well through a sieve, put it into a 
deep dish, and while hot mix in a large .piece of butter 
(at least the size of an egg), add some pepper and send 
it to the table. It is* generally eaten with salted or 
smoked meat. 

Fresh Lima beans are excellent cooked in this man- 
ner with green corn. They must be boiled for half an 
hour or more before they are cooked with the corn. 

Dried beans and dried corn can also be used for 
succotash, but they, must be soaked all night before 
boiling. The water poured on themfor soaking should 
be hot. 

8. Stewed Tomatoes. To a dozen large tomatoes 
mince a good-sized- onion (or less if preferred), and if 
the flavor of onion is not liked omit it altogether; a 
tablespoonful of good brown sugar, a teaspoonful of 
pepper, salt, to taste, a teacupful of bread crumbs, a 
large heaped tablespoonful of good butter. Put into a 
covered stew-pan and cook for 1 hour; shake the pan 
well and frequently. Beat up the yolks of 2 — 3 eggs, 



Vegetables. 469 

and, just before serving, stir them rapidly to the toma- 
toes; let them remain a minute and serve in a small 
tureen or covered dish. This is a fine accompaniment 
to all kinds of baked or roast meats. Tomatoes are 
best when cooked for a long while. 

9. Baked Tomatoes. Peel and mince enough to fill 
a quart dish; season them with sugar, mace, pepper, 
salt and a little minced onion. Put a layer of bread 
crumbs upon the bottom of the dish, then a layer of 
tomatoes, a little butter, another of bread crumbs, 
until the dish is full; bread crumbs must be strewn 
thickly over the top; lay over bits of butter. Bake in 
a moderate oven for 2 hours. 

10. Parsnip Fritters. Boil enough parsnips to make 
2 tumblerfuls when mashed and rubbed through the 
colander, season with salt and pepper, add 1 well-beaten 
egg and flour enough to hold it together (}£ teacupful 
will be sufficient), fry in thick cakes. Serve as fast as 
they are fried. 

11. Baked Egg=Plants. Prepare several fine, large, 
unblemished egg-plants by scooping out the inside or 
pulp with a spoon, leaving the rind standing. To do 
this you must cut off very nicely and evenly a round 
piece from the top, (afterwards to be tied on again). 
Make a sufficient quantity of forcemeat or stuffing of 
soaked bread pressed and dried slightly, fresh butter, 
i ninced. sweet maj oram leaves, a little pepper and salt, 
some powdered mace and the yellow rind of a lemon 
grated off very fine. Mix all these with the pulp or 
inside of the egg-plant. When thoroughly mixed stuff 
with it the rind or outside into a perfectly round shape, 
and with a thread tie on the top piece which was cut 
off. Put the egg-plants into a dish, the bottom covered 
with thin slices of cold ham. Bake them for an hour or 
more, and then send them to the table whole, with the 
slices of ham laid round on the dish. Remove ahe 
strings.

12. Old Fashioned Boiled Dinner. Take 4 pounds 
of corned beef and soak it in cold water, then put it on 
to boil in fresh cold water; skim carefully, then let it 
simmer until tender, but not until it falls to pieces. 



470 The Amekican Kitchen. 

Then let it cool in the liquor in which it is boiled. Pour 
it into a flat shallow dish and press with a slab. Take 
the fat from the liquor and save the latter, butdo not 
let it stand in an iron kettle or tin pan. Boil 2 to 3 
beets the day before and cover them with vinegar, the 
ntixtday take a smallcabbage, a coupleof small carrots, 
a small white turnip, 6 to 8 potatoes and a small 
crooked-neck squash. Wash all of tho vegetables, scrape 
the carrots and quarter the cabbage; the squash and 
turnips should be pared and then cut into slices three- 
quarters 'of an inch long; the potatoes should also be 
pared. About 2 hours before dinner time put the meat 
liquor on to boil; as soon as it boils throw in the car- 
rots, then the cabbage and turnips and one-half hour 
before dinner add the squash and potatoes. When 
tender take the vegetables up carefully and drain the 
cabbage by pressing it in a colander. Slice the carrots. 
Put the cold meat into the center of a large dish and 
serve the carrots, potatoes, and turnips around the 
edge with the other vegetables in separate dishes. Or 
else put each vegetable in to a separate dish by itself. If 
the meat is put on to boil quiteearly, and the fat taken 
off with the vegetables added to the boiling liquor, put- 
ting in those that take the longest time to cook, this 
may all be done the same day. The beets must always 
be boiled alone, takeout the meat and fat beforeputting 
in the vegetables, sending each to the table aswhole and 
daintily as possible. 



HEATS. 



1. Beef Roll. Eemove the tough skin from 5 pounds 
of beef. Spriukie % teaspoonful of pepper, a littleground 
cloves, salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, 3 table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar and 1 teaspoonful of Summer 
savory over the meat and then roll up and tie with & 
narrow piece of muslin. Put into a stewpan, cover with 
cold water and stew for 3% hours. Thicken the gravy 
and then cook for % hour longer. Cornstarch can t'n 
used instead of flour, adding it a few minutes before 
taking it from the fire. This is very good when cold. 



Vegetables. 471 

2. Kidneys Stewed. Take 1 pair of perfectly fresh 
kidneys, split them, take out the white part and the 
sinews from the center. Put them into a kettle, cover 
with cold water and set on a moderate fire until the 
water nearly boils. Drain, cut into pieces, cover again 
with cold water and heat again. Bring to a boil with 
fresh water each time, being careful that the water does 
not boil or the kidneys will harden. In the meantime 
put one tablespoonful of butter and 1 tablespoonful of 
flour into a frying pan, and brown, then gradually stir 
in % pint of stock. Stir with a wooden spoon until it 
has boiled 3 minutes. Then add 1 tablespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom cat- 
sup, salt, pepper and the kidneys. Stir until the kidneys 
are heated through, take from the fire, stir in some 
sherry and serve with chopped parsley, sprinkled over 
the tpp. Kidneys must never boil, for like eggs, the 
more they boil the harder they become. 

3. Scalloped Chicken. Put equal parts of cold 
chicken, boiled rice, macaroni and tomato sauce in 
layers into a shallow dish and cover them with buttered 
crumbs, and then bake until brown. 

Cold roast turkey using stuffing and gravy may be 
prepered in the same manner. 

4. Thanksgiving Chicken Pie. For the crust take 
3 pints of cream, a heaping teaspoonful of salt and 
enough flour so that it will make a stiff enough dough 
to roll out easy. A deep earthen dish with flaring «ides 
should first be lined with a thin layer of past, and the 
remainder of the latter rolled about % inch thick. % of 
a pound of butter are cut into small pieces and put on 
the dough close together, a little flour is then sprinkled 
over the butter andtlie paste rolled over and over, after 
which it is rolled out again to the thickness of a finger 
and rolled up. Cut the ends from the roll, turn the 
pieces over and roll out to the thickness of a_ finger for 
rims. Use milk to moisten the paste lining in the dish 
and place the rims around the sides of the dish, put on 
2 to 3 or 4 rims, one above'the other having the inside 
rim the highest.' Parboil 2 chickens and fill into the 
center of the dish after taking out some of the larger 
bones. Season the liquor with pepper and salt and 



472 The American Kitchen. 

pour it over the chicken, enough to nearly cover. Cut 
a quarter of a pound of butter into pieces the size of a 
chestnut putting them over the meat. Roll the remain- 
der of the crust to fit the top, cutting a slit in it which 
should be turned back to let the steam escape. If you 
can bake this in a brick oven the time required will be 
about 3 hours; if baked in a stove it will take about 
2 hours only and then use only 2 rims of crust. 

5. To Boil Corned Beef. Soak the beef over night 
in plenty of water to cover it well. The following 
morning, wash the piece well, put it in the kettle and 
cover with cold water ; boil slowly and skim frequently. 
If it is to be served cold, let it remain in the kettle 
until it becomes so. 

To prepare it for luncheon or as a supper dish, 
remove all the bones when thoroughly done, pick the 
meat as for salad and pack in a deep dish, putting in 
alternately fat and lean. Skim the liquor, removing all 
fat; boil this broth until reduced one half; pour into 
the dish as much of it as may be needed to fill all the 
spaces left in packing the meat; lay over this a flat 
cover that will just fit it, and place a heavyweight upon 
this. It is best to prepare this dish in cold weather, or 
put upon ice the dish it was prepared in. Serve it upon 
a plate or round dish, and garnish with green sprigs of 
parsley, or celery; serve with it chow-chow, or any 
good pickle. 

6. Beef Hash. Finely chop cold roast beef or cold 
steak, and about twice the quantity of potatoes. Put 
into a frying pan with a large piece of butter, pepper 
and salt; moisten with beef gravy or with hot water; 
cover and let it steam through thoroughly, stirring 
often. When done it should not be watery. Onion may 
also be added if liked. If onion is used, it should first be 
cooked a little in butter before it is added to the hash. 

7. Veal Croquettes. Chop cold veal very fine, take a 
cupful of the meat, adding a little cold boiled chopped 
ham, two or three slices of onion, a pinch of mace, 
powdered parsley and a little pepper and some salt. 
Bring a pint of milk to the boiling point, then add a 
tablespoonful of c" 1 ^ butter and then the chopped 



Meats. 473 

meat. Beat up two eggs and stir in a teaspoonful of 
cornstarch or flour and add to the rest. Cook about 10 
minutes, stirring often. Remove from the fire, spread it 
on a platter^ roll into balls, flattening each when cool ; 
dip them in bread crumbs, fry in a wire basket, dipped 
in lard. 

8. Veal Pot Pie. Take a brisket piece of raal, about 
5 pounds tol quart of water, and stew over a slow fire; 
just before it boils, skim it well and pour in a cupful of 
water, then turn over the meat so that all of the scum 
will rise to the surface. Season with pepper and salt to 
taste. Make a dough of raised yeast. Take 3 pints of 
flour, 2 ounces of butter and wet with milk sufficient to 
make a soft dough, knead it well and set aside to raise: 
when quite light mould and knead again; when it is 
light cut the dough in pieces of equal sizes (do not 
mould or roll it), lay them on top of the meat so as to 
cover it, and cook the whole slowly for one hour. Cover 
the kettle slowly and do not allow the meat to stop 
boiling. 

9. Pot Roast. Take a piece of beef weighing about 
5— 6 pounds. Do not have it too fat. Put it into the 
kettle with barely sufficient water to cover it, and set 
over a slow fire; after it has stewed an hour add salt 
and some pepper. Then stew it slowly until tender, and 
add a little onion if liked. Do not add more water but 
let it nearly all boil away. When tender all through 
take the meat from the kettle and pour the gravy into 
a bowl. Put a large piece of butter into the kettle, take 
each piece of meat and dredge in flour, return to the 
kettle to brown, turning it often so that it will not 
burn. Skim off the fat from the gravy, pour this with 
the meat and stir in a large tablespoonful of flour, 
smoothed in water; let it boil for about 10 minutes 
and pour into the gravy dish. 

^ 10. Beefsteak Rolls. Make a dressing as for turkey; 
take a steak from the round and slightly pound it, 
spread the dressing on the steak, sprinkle with salt, pep- 
per and a few bits of butter; lap over the ends, roll the 
steak up tightly and tie; spread butter over the rolls, 
then dip into well beaten egg, put into a sauce pan 
containing a little water, but the steaks must not lay 



474 The American Kitchen. 

in the water, and bake, basting often. A half hour in a 
well heated oven will suffice. Make a brown gravy and 
sent to the table hot. 

11. Fried Beef Liver. Cut the slices rather thin and 
pour boiling water over them, which keeps the rich 
juices in the meat. Eoll in flour or fine bread crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in egg and fried 
in hot fat and butter mixed. 

12. Beef Croquettes. Chop cold roast or corned beef 
until very fine. Mix with the meat about twice the 
quantity of potatoes (hot), mashed and seasoned with 
butter and salt. Beat up an egg and stir well into the 
potato and meat, and make into balls, flattening them 
a little. Roll in egg and cracker crumbs, fry in butter 
and lard mixed, and brown on both sides. Serve very 
hot. 

13. Roast Beef. When roasting beef, it is very 
essential that the oven is well heated when the meat is 
put in; this causes the pores to close up quickly and 
prevents the escape of the juices. 

Take a rib roast weighing 6 — 8 pounds. Lay it in a 
dripping pan, and baste it well with butter. Set in the 
oven and baste it frequently with drippings. .. When 
partly done, season with salt and pepper, as meat 
will harden when salted when it is raw, and it also 
draws out the juices, then dredge with flour. Roast 
about two hours, leaving the inside a little rare. Take 
the meat out of the pan, skim off all the fat and set the 
meat where it will keep hot; smooth a tablespoonful of 
flour in a little water and add to the gravy, stir in a 
little pepper and a teacupful of boiling water. Boil up 
once and serve hot in a gravy boat. 

14. Yorkshire Pudding. This is a very nice accom- 
paniment to a roast of beef; take about 1 pint of milk, 
4 eggs, beating the yolks separately, a little salt, and 
two tablespoonfuls of baking powder sifted with 2 cups 
of flour. Stir together- until stnboth. Have the roast 
about two-thirds done when the pudding is put into 
the oven. Take the roast from the oven and set where 
it will keep hot. Then take some of the gravy and put 
into two common sized tins, pour half the pudding into. 



Meats. 475 

each, set into a hot oven and keep them until the din- 
ner is ready to be dished up. Take the pudding out of 
the oven the last moment and send to the table hot. 

15. Welsh Rare-Bit. Cut thin slices of bread, re- 
move the crust and toast quickly; butter and cover 
with thin slices of rather new cheese, spread over this a 
little mustard and place on a tin in a hot oven until 
the cheese is melted, then cut into square pieces of any 
size, and serve at once on a hot dish, as it is spoiled if 
allowed to get cold. If mustard is not liked it may be 
omitted. Some think it more delicate if the toast is first 
dipped into a pan of boiling water ; have some cheese 
melted in a cup and pour some over each slice. Have 
the plates hot and serve a slice to each person. 

16. Veal Loaf No. 1. Take a cold fillet of veal, and 
(omitting the fat and skin) mince the meat as fine as 
possible. Mix with it a quarter of a pound of the fattest 
part of a cold ham, also chopped small. Add a tea-cup- 
ful of grated bread-crumbs, a grated nutmeg, half a 
dozen blades of mace, powdered, the grated yellow rind 
of a lemon, and two beaten eggs. Season with a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and half a salt-spoonful of cayenne. 
Mix the whole well together, and make it into the form 
of a loaf. Then glaze it over with beaten yolks of eggs, 
and strew the surface evenly, all over, with grated bread- 
crumbs or with pounded cracker. Set the dish into an 
oven, and bake it half an hour, or till hot all through. 
Have ready a gravy made of the trimmings of the veal, 
stewed in some of the gravy that was left when the 
fillet was roasted the day before. When sufficiently 
cooked, take out the meat, and thicken the gravy with 
beaten yolk of an egg, stirred in about three minutes be- 
fore you take it from the fire. 

Send the veal loaf to the table in a deep dish, with 
the gravy poured round it. 

Chicken loaf, or turkey loaf, may be made in the 
same manner. 

17. Veal Loaf No. 2. Chop 3 pounds of raw veal 
very fine, 3 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of milk or cream and 
butter the size of an egg; mix all together, roll 4 
crackers until fine and mix with the meat. Season with 
salt and pepper and form into a loaf. Bake about 2% 



"476 The Amkkican Kitchen. 

hours. Baste with butter and water while baking. Serve 
cold, cut into thin slices. 

18. Braised Veal. Take a piece of veal from the 
shoulder weighing about 5 pounds, take out the bones, 
and tie up the meat. Put a piece of butter into a kettle 
with a few slices of onion. Put the meat into this and 
let it get hot. Salt and pepper the meat, put on a me- 
dium fire, let it brown on one side, then turn and brown 
on the other side. Then put the kettle where it will sim- 
mer slowly, and if there is not juice enough for the 
gravy, add a few tablespoonfuls of water and a little 
more butter. This can be served either warm or cold. 

19. Roast Spare Ribs. Crack the ribs through the 
middle and trim off all the ends, rub with salt and 
sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff with a dressing, 
sew up tightly, place in a dripping pan with a little 
water, and baste frequently. Brown on one side and 
then turn so that both sides will be equally brown. 

20. Potted Ham. For 2 pounds of lean ham, take 
one of fat pork, mace, half of a nutmeg, grated, and a 
half teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. Mince the ham very 
fine, chopping fat and lean together, then pound in a 
mortar, adding the seasoning; put into a dish and 
bake for about % hour; then .press it into a stone jar, 
fill up the jar with clarified lard, cover closelv and paste 
over it a piece orthick paper. This will keep a long 
time in the Winter. 



FISH. 



1. Baked Pickerel. Wash and wipe the fish care- 
fully, and lay into dripping pan with a very little water. 
Bake slowly, basting often with butter and water. 
Take a cupful of rich milk or sweet cream, add a few 
spoonfuls of hot water, stir in two large spoonfuls of 
butter and a little chopped parsley; heat by setting the 
dish into boiling water, stir in the gravy from the fish, 
and let it come to a boil. Place the fish into a hot dish 
and pour the sauce over it. 



Fish. 477 

2. baked White Fish. Clean the fish thoroughly, cut 
off the head, cut out the back-bone from the head to 
within a few inches from the tail, and stuff with the 
following dressing: Soak stale wheatbread in water 
and squeeze dry; finely chop an onion and fry in but- 
ter; then add the bread, about 2 ounces of butter, salt, 
pepper, and a little sage; heat thoroughly, then add 
the well beaten yolks of two eggs, stuff the fish, sew to- 
gether. Cover the bottom of the pan with water and 
put a little butter over the top of the fish. Bake and 
when done serve with the following sauce: Smooth the 
yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs to a smooth paste with 2 
tablespoonfuls of good salad oil, stir in a half tea- 
spoonful of mustard and add pepper and salt to taste. 

3. Baked Halibut. Lay the halibut into salted 
water for a few hours. Wipe it dry and cut the outer 
skin,"then put it into a dripping pan,basting often with 
butter and water, and bake Tor an hour. It should 
have a nice brown color, and when it can be easily 
pierced with a fork it is done. Add a little water to the 
gravy in the dripping pan, stir in a tablespoonful of 
walnut catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, 
the juice of a lemon, and thicken the sauce with 
browned flour, smoothing the flour with a little water. 
Bring to a boil and serve in a sauce boat. 

4. Boiled Salt flackerel. Wash the mackerel in clear 
water and put to soak in cold water over night, having 
the meat, side down, and in the morning rinse again. 
Wrap each mackerel in a cloth and put into a kettle 
with considerable water, having the water cold, and 
cook about % hour. Carefully take it out of the cloth, 
take out the back bones and pour over it a little 
melted butter and cream, sprinkle lightly with pepper. 

,5. Baked Salt flackerel. Soak the mackerel over 
night, put into a pan and pour on enough boilingwater 
to cover. Let them stand a couple of minutes, drain off 
the water, and put them back into the pan, adding a 
few lumps of butter; pour on a cupful of sweet cream 
or rich milk, and a little pepper, set into the oven and 
bake until brown. 



478 The American Kitchen. 

6. Fried Salt Mackerel. Wash and cleanse the 
mackerel well, and put them into cold water to soak, 
changing the water every two hours; then put them 
into fresh water. In the morning drain off the water, 
wipe them dry, roll in flour and fry in butter on a thick- 
bottomed frying pan. Serve with melted butter and 
garnish with parsley. 

7. Potted Fish. Take out the backbone of the fish; 
for a, fish weighing about 2 pounds take a tablespoon- 
ful of allspice and cloves mixed; put the spice into a 
little bag, put sufficient salt on the fish, then roll in a 
cloth, over which sprinkle a little cayenne pepper; put 
layers of fish, spice and sage in alternate layers into an 
earthen jar, cover with the best vinegar, close the jar 
closely with a plate, over this put a covering of dough 
about % inch thick. Have the edges of the crust adhere 
closely to the jar so as to make it air-tight. Put the jar 
into a pot of cold water and let it boil from 3—5 hours. 
Serve when cold. 

8. Codfish Balls. Take a pint of codfish picked fine, 
two pints of whole raw peeled potatoes, sliced thickly ; 
put them together in plenty of cold water and cook 
until the potatoes are thoroughly cooked ; take from 
the fire and drain. Mash, add a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, and about 3 spoonfuls of rich milk. Make 
into little balls, put butter and lard half and half into 
a frying pan, and when hot put in the balls and fry 
to a nice brown. 

9. Stewed Codfish. Take a piece of codfish and lay 
it into cold water for a few minutes. Pick it into small 
pieces, put it on the fire in a stewpan with cold water, 
let it come to a boil, drain Off the water, and then add 
a pint of milk to the/fish. Set it on the fire again, and 
let it boil slowly for a few minutes, then add a large 
piece of butter, a little pepper, and flour enough to 
thicken the milk to make a cream. Stew a few minutes 
longer, and just before serving stir in the well beaten 
yolks of two eggs. 

10. Baked Codfish. Soak and pick the fish the same 
as for codfish balls. Take the same quantity of cold 
mashed potatoes as you have fish, a large piece of but- 



Fish. 479 

ter and milk to make it soft. Put into a buttered dish, 

Eut bits of butter over the top, and bake for about % 
our. 

11. Boiled Salmon. After carefully emptying the 
salmon, wash it very clean from the blood inside, and 
remove the scales. To preserve the fine color of the sal- 
mon, or to set the curd or creamy substance between 
the flakes, it should be put into boiling water, allowing 
to a gallon of water a handful of salt. After the water 
has been boiling a few minutes, and ,has been skimmed, 
put in the fish, (laying it on the drainer,) and let it 
boil moderately fast, skimming it well. It must be 
thoroughly boiled. Underdone fish of every kind is dis- 
gusting and unwholesome. Before it is taken from the 
fish kettle ascertain if it is sufficiently cooked, by trying 
if the back-bone easily loosens from the flesh. A quarter 
of an hour may be allowed for each pound, for a large 
thick salmon requires as much cooking as meat. When 
you take it up, drain it well, and serve it up imme- 
diately. Have ready some lobster sauce, or shrimp, ii 
more convenient. To make it, mince the meat of a 
boiled lobster, mashing the coral with it, and mix it 
with melted or drawn butter, made very thick, and 
having but a very small portion of water. For shrimp 
sauce, boil the shrimps, take off their heads, and squeeze 
out their bodies from the shells. Thicken with them the 
drawn butter. Nothing should go with salmon that 
will interfere with the flavor of this fine fish, or give it 
any taste that will overpower or weaken its own. 

12. Baked Fish. Make a stuffing by using the 
following receipt, and fill into "the fish, which was 
first cleaned and wiped dry. After the fish is stuffed, 
sew it together with a needle and thread. Lay it on an 
earthen-ware dish or a platter on which it pan be 
served, for it is difficult to remove the fish after it is 
baked. Sprinkle flour over the fish, and put a few slices 
of salt pork on top of the fish, and sprinkle salt over it*. 
Baste it in the liquor in which it is baked. Add a little 
water, if there should not be enough. Bake in a mo- 
derate oven. When the fish can easily be pierced with a 
fork, take it from the oven, remove the pork and the 
thread and serve. 



480 The American Kitchen. 

13. Stuffing for Baked Fish. Soak dry bread or 
crumbs in water. Press dry, and add the following in- 
gredients : A piece of butter the size of an egg, 1% table- 
spoonful of Summer savory, 1 tablespoonful of thyme, 
% tablespoonful of majoram, salt to taste, and 1 tea- 
spoonful of pepper. A beaten egg may also be added. 



SHELL FISH. 

1. Lobster Croquettes. Take remnants of lobster 
and pound until the dark and the light meat and coral 
are well mixed ; add to the fish not quite as much bread 
crumbs as you have fish, season with salt and pepper; . 
add some melted butter — about 2 tablespoohfuls— form 
into round balls, roll in egg, then in fine bread crumbs 
and fry in hot lard. 

2. Deviled Crabs. Boil and mince % dozen fresh 
crabs, 2 ounces of butter, 1 teaspoonful of mustard, 
cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Put the meat into 
a bowl and carefully mix through it an equal quantity 
of fine bread crumbs. Cream the butter, mix the 
mustard well with it, then stir in carefully (a handful at 
a time) the mixed crabs, a teaspoonful of cream and 
the crumbs. Season with pepper and salt, fill the crab 
shells with the mixture, sprinkle bread crumbs over the 
tops, put small pieces of butter over the tops of each, 
and brown them quickly in a hot oven. 

3. Crab Pie. Throw some live crabs into boiling 
salted water, boil for % hour. When cold pick the meat 
from the claws and body. Chop together and mix with 
it bread crumbs, pepper, salt and a little butter. Put 
this into the shells and brown in the oven. A crab shell 
will hold the meat of two crabs. 

4. Fried Oysters. Take large oysters and dry them 
in a napkin; then heat an ounce each of butter and 
lard in a thick frying pan. Season with pepper and salt, 
and then dip each one into egg and cracker crumbs. 
Place them into the hot grease and fry a delicate 
brown. Serve them crisp and hot. 



Poultry. 481 

5. Boston Fried Oysters. Turn the oysters in fine 
cracker meal and egg batter; fry for about 10 minutes 
over a slow fire in butter; cover the hollow of a hot 
platter with tomato sauce and place the oysters in it, 
but they must not be covered ; garnish with chopped 
parsley. 

6. Oyster Fritters. Select good-sized oysters, drain 
off the liquor, and to a cup of this juice add a cupful of 
milk, a little salt, four^well-beaten eggs, and enough 
flour to make a batter. Surround the oysters in the bat- 
ter, then fry in butter and lard, turning them so as to 
brown them on both sides. Serve very hot. 

7. Scalloped Oysters. Eoll crackers very fine so as 
to have about one pint of crumbs. Butter a deep 
earthen-ware dish, pour in a little of the oyster liquor, 
then put in a layer of oysters, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and lay small pieces of butter upon them, then 
another layer of cracker crumbs and oyster juice, then 
oysters, pepper, salt and butter, and- so on until the 
dish is filled ; the top layer to be of cracker crumbs. 
Beat an egg and add to it one cupful of milk, and turn 
this over the oysters. Cover the dish and bake for one- 
half hour. When baked through uncover the dish, and 
set on the top grate to brown. 

8. Clam Fritters. Take 25 large sand clams from 
their shells; cut each in two, and lay them on a folded 
napkin. Put a pint of flour into a basin, add to it one- 
half pint of sweet milk, 3 well -beaten eggs, and 
nearly as much of their liquor as you have milk, beat 
the batter until smooth, then stir in the clams. Put 
plenty of lard into a pan, let it become boiling hot, and 
then put in the batter by the spoonful, fry to a delicate 
brown on one side and then turn on the other. 



POULTRY. 

1. Dressing or Stuffing for Fowls. Cut off the crust 
from stale slices of wheatbread, and pour warm water 
on the bread. Then press until dry, put into another 
dish, add pepper, salt, a teaspoonful of powdered 



482 The American Kitchen. 

savory, the same amount of sage and % cupful of melted 
butter, and a beaten egg. Work all together thoroughly 
and fill into the fowl. 

2. Oyster Dressing. Use the same ingredients as 
given above, adding drained and chopped oysters. This 
stuffing is used in dressing turkey and chicken. Use the 
liquor and some of the oysters to make a sauce to 
pour over the turkey when served ; or else it may be 
served separately in a sauce boat. 

/ 3. Turkey Scallop. Take a cold turkey, and pick out 
all of the bones and chop fine. Butter a dish, put in a 
layer of bread crumbs moistened with milk, then put in 
a layer of turkey with some filling, and put small pieces 
of butter over the top, sprinkle with pepper and salt; 
then another layer of bread crumbs, turkey and so on 
until the dish is filled; add a little hot water to the 
gravy, and pour this over the scallop. Then beat 2 
eggs with 2 tablespoonfuls of milk, 1 tablespoonful of 
melted btffcter, a little salt, and cracker crumbs so that 
you can spread it over the scallop with a knife, dot with 
bits of butter and cover with a plate. Bake for an hour. 
A few moments before serving remove the plate and let 
the scallop brown on the top. 

4. Boned Turkey. Carefully clean and wash the 
fowl. Take a sharp pointed knife, and beginning at the 
end of the wing, pass the knife down clos,e to the bone, 
cutting all the meat from the bone, leaving the skin 
whole; run the knife down on each side of the breast 
bone, and up the legs close to the bone; fill the places 
where the bones were with a stuffing, keeping the fowl 
in its natural shape. Sew all the incisions made in the 
skin, then lard with rows of fat bacon, basting often 
with broth and a little butter. Carve across in slices, 
and serve with tomato sauce. 

5. Fricassee of Chicken. Cut up two young chickens, 
and put them into a stew pan with just enough cold 
water to cover them. Bring them slowly to a boil, and 
then cook them for an hour or until they are tender. 
When they are tender, season them with salt, pepper, a 
piece of butter, and a little celery if liked. Smooth a 
little flour in water and add to the stew, also the well 



Bread, Fritters, Crullers, Etc. 483 

beaten yolks of two eggs; bring to a boil. Lay the 
chicken on a platter, and pour some gravy over it. 
Serve the remainder in a sauce boat. Stir a little of the 
hot gravy with the egg before adding it ( to the chicken. 

6. Chicken Patties'. Finely chop some cold chicken, 
season it with pepper and salt, some minced parsley 
and onion. Moisten this with chicken gravy,' fill into 
scalloped shells that are lined with crust, and sprinkle 
with bread crumbs over the top. Dot with small pieces 
of butter and bake in a hot oven. 

7. Chicken Croquettes. Chop cold roast chicken very 
finely, and add an equal amount of smoothly mashed 
potatoes, season with butter, salt, pepper and a little 
mustard. Make into cakes, dip into beaten egg and 
bread crumbs, and fry to a light brown. 

8. Chicken Pot Pie. Cut up a large chicken, cover 
with cold water, and boil gently until tender. Season 
with salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with 2 
tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed smooth with -a piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Roll out light bread-dough 
about an inch thick; and cut with the top of a small 
wine-glass ; set them aside to raise for about % hour, 
then drop them into the boiling gravy. Put the cover 
on the pot, and cover very closely so as not to have 
the steam escape, and the water must not stop boiling. 
Boil for three-fourths of an hour. 



BREAD, FRITTERS, CRULLERS, Etc. 

1. Sponge for Winter Use. Peel and boil 4—5 
medium-sized potatoes in 2 quarts of water ; when done 
take out of the water, and press through a sieve or 
mash very fine in the dish in which the sponge is to be 
made, make a depression in the center into which put a 
cupful of flour, and pour over it the boiling water from 
the potatoes. Stir thoroughly, and when cool add a 
pint of warm water to make a thin batter, and a cupful 
of yeast. This sponge will make very moist bread, 



484 The American Kitchen. 

,2. Bread Raised Twice. Measure out4 quarts of flour, 
take out about 1 cupful and put the remainder into 
a pan. Make a depression in the middle, into which put 
1 tablespoonful of sugar, 1 tablespoonful of salt and 1 
cupful of yeast ; then mix in 1 pint of milk which was 
made lukewarm by adding 1 pint of warm water. Beat 
well with a strong spoon, and knead for 20 — 30minutes; 
let it raise over night; in the morning knead again, 
mould into loaves, let them raise until about twice 
their size, and bake not quite 1 hour. 

3. Salt= Raising Bread. Prepare the leaven in the 
following manner : Put 1 pint of lukewarm water into a 
bowl, and stir up a thick batter, adding only a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; beat -the batter thoroughly, set in a 
pan of warm water and keep warm, and in 2—4 hours 
it will begin to raise. When it is nearly light enough, 
take 1 pint of milk and a pint of boiling water, mix the 
sponge in a bread pan, and when cooled about luke- 
warm stir in the leaven. The sponge will be light in about 
2 — 4 hours if kept warm. The dough does not require 
as much kneading as yeast-raised dough. Bread made 
in this Avay should be made oftener, as it dries more 
quickly than bread made with potatoes. Some people 
object to it because of the odor in raising, which is the 
result of acetous fermentation, but-the more of that the 
more sure you are of having sweet bread when raised. 

4. Raw Potato Yeast. Peel 3 large potatoes and lay 
them into cold water. Then grate one potato in a large 
dish, pour over it at once one pint of boiling water to 
cook the potato. Grate the next potato, and pour on 
another pint of water, then grate the third, and over 
this also pour 1 pint of boiling water. Do not grate 
them all at once as the potato will turn dark. Stir 
quickly with a silver spoon, adding salt and about % 
cupful of sugar. When it is lukewarm stir in 1 cupful of ■ 
yeast. When light it will be covered with a thick foam. 
This yeast makes delicious bread. __

PIES AND PUDDINGS. 

1. Squash Pie No. 1. 1 pint of cooked squash, % cup- 
fill of sugar, 1 cupful of milk, 1 egg, % teaspoonful of 
salt, and % teaspoonful of mace. Press the squash 
through a sieve, add sugar, salt, mace, the well-beaten 
egg, and the milk. Beat all together, and fill into a 
pie plate lined with a good crust. 

2. Squash Pie No. 2. Cook the squash and press 
through a sieve. Take 1 pint of this squash, add 1 cup- 
ful of milk, 1 egg, % cupful of sugar, % teaspoonful of 
salt, and % teaspoonful of mace. Beat all together, and 
fill into a deep plate, lined with a good crust. Bake 
with one crust. 

3. Mince=Meat Pies. To prepare the meat: Chop 
fine 2 pounds of lean, tender beef, cold, boiled, or baked ; 
remove all skin and gristle. (The tongue and heart of 
a very young, beef, boiled tender, makes the best mince- 
meat.) Mince fine % pound of suet, 1 pound of raisins, 
seeded ; 1 pound of dried currants, washed and picked ; 
% pound of citron, sliced thin; the same of candied 
orange or lemon peel; 1 pound of clean, moist brown 
sugar; the juice of 6 lemons, the rinds grated (throw 
away the pulp); 2 nutmegs grated, 1 ounce of salt, 1 
ounce of ground ginger, the same of coriander seed, 
pounded and sifted; %' ounce of allspice and cloves each; 
Mix the meat, fruits, and spices well. Pour upon the 
sugar a pint of wine and J£ pint of brandy; add the 
fruits to the meat; pour over the wine and brandy. 
When it is well mixed, pack it in small jars, and pour 
over the top of the meat the best syrup an inch thick; 
cover closely, and keep the jars in a cool place. When 
ready to make the pies, line the pie-plates with a good 
crust; add to a pint of the mixture a pint of tart apples 
chopped, and a wine-glass of rose-water. Fill the crust 
half full; lay over bits of butter; put in more meat to 
nearly fill the plate; cover with puff paste; cut a slit in 
the middle, and bake. They keep well. Warm them be- 
fore serving. Cold fowls are sometimes used to make 
pies for immediate use. An excellent way to keep the 
meat a few weeks is to spice the meat, pack it away, 
covering closely with syrup, and add the fruits, wine, 
and brandy when the pies are made. 



500 The American Kjtchen. 

}. " Lemon Pie. 1 cupful of sugar, 1 cupful of thick 
sweet cream, 4 eggs and 2 lemons. Grate the rind of the 
lemons, squeeze out the juice, add the sugar and the 
yolks of the eggs, and beat to a cream ; add the cream, 
and bake in a rich undercrust. Beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth, beat in a few tablespooniuls of 
powdered sugar, spread on the top of the pie when the 
pie is baked, then set it in the oven to set the meringue. 

5. Cocoanut Pie. 1 cupful of sugar, 1 cupful of sweet 
milk, the grated rind of a lemon, 4 eggs, 1 tablespoonful 
of butter, 1 grated cocoanut. Stir the sugar with the 
butter, and add the yolks of the eggs, then stir in the 
cocoanut, the milk and the grated rind of a lemon, and 
lastly the whites of the eggs beaien to a stiff froth. 
Bake in a deep dish lined with paste. 

6. Boiled Apple Dumplings. % pint of cold milk or 
water, 2 quarts of finely chopped apples, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of butter, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 quart of flour, and 
2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Stir together flour, 
baking powder and salt. Rub together the butter and 
the flour, then stir in the apples, and make into a loaf 
with the milk or water. Any kind of fruit may be used 
instead of the apples. Serve with a brandy or a lemon 
sauce. The water must be boiling when the pudding is 
put in to boil, and must not stop boiling until the 
pudding is done. . 

7. Steamed Suet Pudding. 1 cupful of molasses, 1 
cupful of water or milk, 1 cupful of chopped raisins or 
currants, % cupful of butter, 1 cupful of chopped suet, % 
teaspoonful of nutmeg, % teaspoonful of cinnamon, %

f uls of flour. Sift the 1 soda, the salt and the spices into 
the flour, rub the butter in the flour and then add the 
raisins. Mix the milk with the molasses, and stir into 
the flour. Steam in a buttered pudding Jmould for two 
hours. Serve with a brandy sauce. 

8. Boiled Corn=Meal Pudding. Warm a pint of milk 
and a pint of molasses, and stir well together. Then 
beat together 4 eggs, and stir these with 1 cupful of 
chopped beef suet and corn-meal enough to make a stiff 
batter. Stir in a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little 



Pies and Puddings. 501 

water, a little cinnamon and nutmeg.. Then dip a cloth 
into boiling water, wring out, sprinkle a little flour over 
it, and put in the pudding and tie, leaving room for the 
pudding to swell. Cook for about three hours. 

9. Apple Dumplings. Kemove the peel and core from 
some good cooking apples. Make a rich biscuit dough 
of baking powder; roll the dough about % inch thick, 
and enclose an apple in each, filling the core of the apple 
with a little sugar, cinnamon and a small piece of but- 
ter. Butter a dripping pan, and set the dumplings into 
it side by side. Then put in a cupful of hot water, put a 
piece of butter over each dumpling, and sprinkle over 
them a handful of sugar. Baste the dumplings once 
while baking with the liquor, and serve with cream and 
sugar. 

10. Baked Apple Pudding. The yolks of 4 eggs, 6 
large grated apples, 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, % cupful 
of sugar, the juice and half of the peel of a lemon. Beat 
the sugar and butter to a cream, stir in the yolks and 
lemon with the grated apples. Pour in a deep pudding 
dish and bake. Whip the whites and pour over the pud- 
ding. Grate a little nutmeg over the top. Set in the 
oven for a moment. Serve with cream. Eat cold. 

11. Apples Baked Whole. Never bake apples with- 
out paring and coring. They will be found nearly all 
skin and core, and are troublesome and inconvenient to 
eat. Have fine large apples, take off a thin paring and 
extract the core with a tin corer. Fill up the holes with 
brown sugar. Place the apples side by side in a square 
tin pan, set them in on oven and bake until, when tried 
with a fork, you find them soft all through. Send them 
to table warm, but not hot, and serve with sweet cream. 

12. Fruit Dumplings. 1 pint of flour sifted, and 
1 heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. Kub the but- 
ter with the flour and then mix wfth enough milk until 
quite soft. Spread this on the bottom of a round tin 
baking dish, and cover with sliced apples or peaches. 
Steam for % hour and serve with sugar and cream. 

13. Lemon Pie. Grate off the rinds of 2 lemons, 
squeeze out the juice, add 1 cupful of sugar and the 
yolks of 4 eggs and beat to a cream. Then add 1 cupful 



502 The American Kitchen. 

of cream and bake in a rich, tinder crust. Beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff froth, beat in a few tablespotmfuls 
of powdered sugar, spread on the top of the pie and set 
the pie into the oven for a few seconds to brown. 

14. A Brown Betty. Pare, core and slice thin some 
fine juicy apples. Cover the bottom of a large deep 
dish with the apples. Sweeten them well with plenty 
of brown sugar, adding grated lemon or orange peel. 
Strew over them a thick layer of bread crumbs and add 
to the crumbs a very few bits of fresh butter. Then put 
in another layer of cut apples and sugar, followed by*a 
second layer of bread crumbs and butter. Next more 
apples and sugar, then more bread crumbs and butter; 
repeat this until the dish is full, finishing with bread 
crumbs. Bake until the apples are entirely done and 
quite soft. Send to table hot. It will be improved by 
adding to each layer of apples a very little sweet unfer- 
mented cider, fresh from the press. 

15. Cranberry Puffs. 2 cupfuls of flour, 2 teaspoon, 
fuls of baking powder, 2 tablespoonf uls of butter, % tea- 
spoonful of salt, 2 eggs, 1 pint of cranberries and 1 cup- 
ful of milk. <. 

Sift flour and baking powder together, rub the but- 
ter into the flour, add the salt to the eggs and beat to 
a thick cream. Add the cranberries to the flour, then 
the eggs and milk. Fill buttered cups about half full 
of the mixture, set in a steamer closely covered and 
steam for 1 hour. They should come out perfect puff 
balls. They are spongy and absorb a great deal of 
sauce. Serve with plain pudding sauce. 

16. Peach Cobbler. % cupful of milk, 1 egg, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter, % teaspoonful of salt, 2 cupfuls 
of flour and 2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, also 
1 quart of peeled peaches. Sift together the flour, salt 
and- the baking powder, rub in the butter, then beat 
the egg and milk together and stir into the flour to 
make a nice batter. ■ Turn on a well-floured board and 
roll to the thickness of about an inch. Line an earthen- 
ware dish with the paste, invert a cup in the center of 
the dish and fill the peaches around it. Sprinkle with 
sugar and put on a top crust. Bake % hour in a hot 



Pies and Puddings. 503 

oven. When the pudding is cut the cup will be found to 
contain a very rich juice, which is used as a sauce for 
the pudding. 

17. Fig Pudding. Mince very fine % pound of suet 
and the same quantity of figs; then mix with them 
% pound of finely grated bread crumbs, with a little 
sugar and enough golden syrup to make a nice paste. 
Butter a mould, fill it with the mixture and boil or 
steam it for 1% hours. Turn it out and serve either 
plain or with whipped cream or syrup sauce. The latter 
ig made by flavoring a little white sauce with some 
lemon rind and a spoonful of golden syrup. 

18. Tapioca Pudding, No. 1. Pour a quart of milk 
over a cupful of tapioca. The milk should be boiling 
hot and sweetened to taste. Beat 6 eggs well and when 
the milk is nearly cold pour it slowly upon the eggs, 
stirring rapidly; season with nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Bake for % hour and serve with rich sauce. 

19. Tapioca Pudding, No. 2. Soak a cupful of tap- 
ioca for 1 hour in 2 cupfuls of milk. Put in a stew-pan 
half a dozen medium-sized tart apples, peeled and cored ; 
the cavities filled with sugar and a little powdered cin- 
namon. Pour to them a cupful of water; cover the 
stew-pan and stew until the apples are tender. Take 
them up, put them into an enameled dish, pour over 
them any syrup that may remain in i£e stew-pan, add 
to the tapioca another cupful of rich, sweet milk; pour 
over the apples and bake. Eat with rich, solid butter 
sauce. 

20. Floating Island. For one common-sized float- 
ing island have a round thick jelly cake, lady cake or 
almond sponge cake, that will weigh 1J£— 2 pounds. 
Slice it downwards, almost to the bottom, but do not 
take the slices apart. Stand up the cake in the center 
of a glass bowl or a deep.dish. Have ready 1% pints of 
rich cream, make it very sweet with sugar and color it 
a fine green with a teacupful of the juice of pounded 
spinach, boiled 5 minutes by itself; strained and made 
very sweet. Or for coloring pink you may use currant 
jelly, or the juice of preserved strawberries. Whip to 
a stiff froth 1% pints more of sweetened cream, and 



504 The American Kjtchen. 

flavor it with a large glass of mixed wine and brandy. 
Pour round the cake as it stands in the dish or bowl, 
the colored, unfrothed cream, and pile the whipped 
white cream all over the cake, highest on the top. 



PRESERVES, JELLIES AND PICKLES. 

1. Currant Jelly. Currants should not be over ripe, 
neither should they be gathered after a rain, as they are 
then apt to be watery. Eemove all the leaves and the 
poor fruit, and if gritty wash and drain, but do not 
stem them. Put them into a porcelain kettle, mask 
them with a wooden spoon but do not heat the fruit, as 
this will darken the ]elly. Then put the fruit into a 
flannel bag and drain over night. Do not squeeze them, 
or the jelly will be cloudy. The next morning take a 
bowl of sugar for each bowl of juice. Heat in an earth- 
enware dish in the oven, stirring often to prevent burn- 
ing. Boil the juice for about 20 minutes, skimming 
thoroughly. Then add the hot sugar and boil for 5 
minutes, or until it will thicken in a spoon when exposed 
to the air. Pour into glasses and set aside for 24 hours,- 
then dip a paper in brandy and tie it over the top. 

2. Quince Jelly. Eemove all dark spots, take off 
the stem and wipe the fruit carefully. The best part of 
the fruit is used* for canning, the core, peel and other 
parts no*t used for canning are used for making jelly. 
The seed contains a large part of gelatinous substance 
and also gives the jelly a nice color. Boil in enough 
water to cover until soft, then mash and drain. Then 
take as much sugar as fruit juice when it is boiling, and 
boil until it jellies. 

3. Tomato Catsup. Boil 1 bushel of ripe tomatoes 
until soft, strain through a colander. Then stir in 
1 cupful of salt, 2 pounds of brown sugar, about % ounce 
of cayenne pepper, 3 ounces each of ground allspice, 
mace and celery seed, and 2 ounces of ground cinnamon. 
Then add 2 quarts of the best vinegar, stir all well 
together, and strain through a sieve. Boil slowly until 
reduced about one-half. Put into bottles, seal, and 
keep in a dark, cool place. 



Preserves, Jellies and Pickles. 505 

4. Watermelon Preserves. Select a melon with a 
thick rind ; cut in any desired shape and lay the pieces 
into strong salt water for 24 hours, then soak in clear 
water for 24 hours, changing the water often. Then 
put them into alum water for an hour to harden them. 
Then to every pound of fruit take 1 pound of sugar. 
Make a syrup of the sugar, a few small pieces of white 
ginger root and 1 lemon, sliced. After the syrup has 
boiled take out the ginger root and the lemon, and put 
in the watermelon. Let it boil until transparent, then 
carefully take out the melon, put it into jars and pour 
the syrup over it. 

5. Quince and Citron Preserves. Pare and cut the 
citron into small pieces; boil hard in medium-strong 
alum water for about % hour ; drain and boil in fresh 
water until the color is changed and they are tender. 
Carefully wash the quinces and pare, quarter, core and 
halve them, boil the core and parings in water enough 
to cover them, for 1% hours; remove and add the quinces 
to the liquid ; boil, and when they begin to be tender 
add the citron and % pound of white sugar to every 
pound of the fruit. 

6. Canned Pumpkins. Peel the pumpkins or squash, 
cut into small pieces and stew until tender. Do not add 
any^seasoning. Then mash them very fine. Have the 
cans hot, fill them with the hot pumpkins or squash, 
seal them tight and put in a dark, cool place. 

7. Peach Jelly. Pare and slice the peaches, taking 
out the stones. Put the peach slices into a kettle with 
water enough- to cover them, adding about one-fourth 
of the kernels. Stir often and when the fruit is well 
cooked strain, it and to every pint of peaches add the 
juice of 1 lemon ; then measure again and for each pint 
of peach juice add 1 pound of sugar. Heat the sugar 
and add the juice after it has boiled about 20 minutes. 
Then let it come to a boil and take it immediately from 
the fire. Fill into glasses and keep in a dark, cool place. 

8. Pie=Plant Butter. For each pound of peeled and 
cut up pie-plant allow 1 pound of sugar. Let this sugar 
and pie-plant cook for an hour, then put into cans and 
seal. 



506 The American Kitchen. 

9. Apple Jelly. Use apples that are pleasantly acid. 
Peel and core, and, as you cut them, throw the pieces 
immediately into cold water to prevent their being dis- 
colored by the action of the air. Whea you have pre- 
pared as many as you wish to use, put them into the 
preserving -kettle, and pour over them just enough 
water to cover them. Cover closely and let them boil 
without interruption until the apples are soft; then 
strain through a thin linen bag into some vessel that 
can be kept covered. The proportion for making the 
jelly is to 2 tumblers of the juice use 1% tumblers of 
sugar. Measure the juice and the sugar in this propor- 
tion and put into the kettle. Let this syrup boil for a 
few minutes ; then strain through a jelly bag. Eeturn 
to the kettle 2 tumblerfuls of the syrup; this, boiled to 
the proper consistency, will form 1 tumblerful Of jelly. 
After preparing the juice and measuring the propor- 
tions,^ is safeto make the jelly thusin small quantities. 

Quince jelly is made in the same manner. Straw- 
berries, blackberries, raspberries and grapes all make 
very pleasant jellies. After washing the fruit, put it on 
to boil without any water, and when the juice is all 
extracted strain and proceed as in apple jelly: 

10. Preserved Crabapples. Take the finest Siber- 
ian crabapples, which, being always red and pleasantly 
acid, are the only sort now used for preserving. Rub 
each crabapple with a dry, clean flannel and then 
prick every one in several places with a large needle to 
prevent their bursting. To every pound of fruit allow 
1% pounds of double-refined loaf sugar, and a pint of 
water. First make a syrup of the sugar and water, 
boiling it in a porcelain kettle, and skimming it until 
perfectly clear. Put in the crabapples, adding for each 
pound the juice and grated yellow rind of a large lemon. 
The lemon is indispensable to this sweetmeat. Simmer 
them slowly in the syrup until tender all through, so 
that they can be pierced with a twig of broom-corn, but 
do not allow them to break. When done put them up 
warm in glass jars more than half full, and the syrup 
dver them. 

11. Candied Orange and Lemon Peel. Remove the 
/puip and inside skin, cut the peel in strips lengthwise, 



Preserves, Jellies and Pickles. - 507 

boil in clear water until tender. Make a, syrup in the 
proportion of % pound of sugar to 1 pound of the peel, 
adding to the sugar as much water as will melt it. Put 
in the peel and boil over a slow fire until the syrup 
candies, then take them out, strew powdered sugar over 
them and set in the sun to dry, or, if the weather 
will not admit of this, dry them in a warm oven. 
These will be found very useful in making fruit cakes or 
puddings. 

12. Orange Syrup. Use sweet, thin-skinned oranges, 
squeeze the juice, add sugar enough to make a thick 
syrup. Boil and skim until clear. Pour off when clear 
and bottle when cool. A tablespoouful in a glass of 
water is delicious. Flavor with a little of the grated 
rind put in before boiling; a little in pudding sauce is 
good. Lemons may be prepared in the same way. 
Flavor the sugar by rubbing lumps upon the outside of 
the fruit and then add it to the juice; this is better than 
adding the peel. 

13. Pineapples Preserved. Take 6 fine large pine- 
apples, as rjpe as you can get them. Clean them very 
nicely, but do not, at first, pare off the rind or cut off 
the leaves. The rind and leaves being left on while boil- 
ing will keep in the flavor of the fruit. Put the pine- 
apples whole into a very large and very clean iron pot. 
Fill it up with cold water and boil the pineapples until 
they are so tender that you can .pierce them through 
the rind to the core, with a splinter skewer or a twig 
from a broom. Then take them out of 'the pot and 
drain them. When they are so cool as to be handled 
without inconvenience, remove the leaves and pare off 
the rind. Cut them into round slices about % inch 
thick, extracting the cores from the center so as to leave 
a small round hole in every slice. Weigh them and to 
each pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Cover the 
bottom of a large, dish or dishes with a thick layer of 
the sugar. On this place, a layer of pineapple slices, 
then a layer of sugar, then a layer oJ fruit, and so on 
until the slices are all thickly covered, fiaiabing with a 
layer of sugar at the ton. Let them stand 24 hours. 
Then drain the slices from the syrup and lay them in 
wide jar». Put all the syrup into a clear po»eelain 



508 The American Kitchen. 

kettle, and boil and skim it until the scum ceases to 
rise. Then pour it hot upon the pineapple. While, 
warm, cover the jars closely with white paper cut to fit, 
and dipped in brandy, and cover tightly. There is no 
better way of preserving pineapples, or that retains the , 
flavor so well. 

Quinces may be preserved in the same manner. 

14. Preserved Tomatoes. This is an excellent and 
popular sweetmeat, when flavored well with lemon, 
which is indispensable to making it palatable. Also, 
it should be well penetrated with sugar, therefore it is 
best not to attempt preserving tomatoes whole. The 
most convenient for preserving are those with smooth, 
even surfaces. If fluted or cleft they are difficult to 
peel when scalded, as the skins do not strip off so easily. 
Having weighed the tomatoes (which must be full-grown 
and quite ripe) allow to every 2 .pounds, 2 pounds of 
the best brown sugar, a large spoonful of ground ginger 
and the juice and grated rind of 1 large ripe lemon, 
rolled awhile under your hand. Having scalded and 
peeled all the tomatoes, and mixed with the sugar a 
little beaten white of egg, put them into a porcelain- 
lined preserving kettle (uncovered), and add, gradually, 
the sugar: Boil the tomatoes and sugar slowly to- 
gether until the scum ceases to appear. Then add, 
gradually, the lemons (peel and juice) and boil slowly for 
an hour or more. The tomatoes must all have bursted, 
otherwise they will not keep, from the sugar not getting 
sufficiently into them. When done, take them off the 
Are, put the tomatoes with their syrup into glass jars 

- and seal. 

15. Canned Pears. To every 3 pounds of fruit allow 
1% pounds of sugar and % pint of water. Peel the pears 
and lay them in cold water to keep them from turning 
dark before they are wanted. When the syrup is boil- 
ing, put the pears in and cook until they look clear or a 
fork can be stuck into them easily. Have the jars 
standing in a pan of hot water, and carefully fill them 
with the fruit. Pour the hot syrup over them, filling , 
the jars to the top. Cover and seal. ^ , 

16. Brandied Pears. In making brandied pears, 
Bartletts are the only variety that will give entire

satisfaction when brandied, as they have a more decided 
flavor than any other. Select firm, but ripe pears, peel, 
and boil in a weak syrup until they can be pierced with 
a straw. Take the fruit out, drain ancfput into jars. 
Have ready a rich, hot syrup, made with 3 pounds of 
sugar and % pint of water and fill the jars containing 
the fruit with equal parts of the syrup and white brandy. 
Cover immediately. 

17. Ginger Pears are a delicious sweetmeat. Use a 
hard pear, peel, core and cut the fruit into very thin 
slices. For 8 pounds of fruit after it has been sliced use 
the same quantity of sugar, the juice of 4 lemons, 1 
pint of water and % pound of ginger root, sliced thin. 
Cut the lemon rinds into as long and thin strips as pos- 
sible. Place all together in a preserving kettle and boil 
slowly for an hour. 

18. Spiced Pears are an excellent relish. To make 
them, place in a porcelain kettle 4 pounds of sugar, 
1 'quart of vinegar, 1 ounce of stick cinnamon and 
% ounce of cloves. When this comes to a boil add to it 
8 pounds of pears that have been peeled and cook until 
tender. Skim out the fruit and put in glass jars. Boil 
the syrup until thick and pour it over them. Apples 
may be used in the same manner. 

19. Pickled Pears. Boil together 3 pounds of sugar, 
3 pints of vinegar and 1 ounce of stick cinnamon. Use 
7 pounds of sound pears, wash, and stick 3— 4 cloves in 
each pear, put them into the hot syrup, cook slowly 
25 minutes, turn them into a stone jar with the syrup 
and cover. The following day pour off the liquid and 
heat and tur^n over the fruit again. It may require 
heating the second time. 

20. -Grape Preserves. To make grape preserves 
press the pulp from the fruit with the fingers and put it/ 
over the fire to boil. When boiling rub it through a 
sieve to remove the seeds. Put the juice, pulp and skins 
into a preserving kettle, and to every pint add 1 pound 
of granulated sugar and boil until as thick as required. 

21. Grape Jelly. Grapes are one of the best fruits 
we have for jellies. Wild grapes are considered by many 
as even better than the cultivated fruit. To make jelly 



510 The American Kitchen. 

stem the grapes carefully and wash well. Put them into 
a preserving kettle, cover and heat slowly. Stir fre- 
quently and cook until the fruit is well broken and lias 
boiled. Take from the fire and squeeze thi'ough a jelly 
bag. Measure the juice into a porcelain kettle s and set 
upon the stove to boil. For each pint of juice allow 
1 pound of granulated sugar, and while the juice is boil 
ing place the sugar on tin pans and put it in the oven, 
stirring often. When the juice has boiled steadily 20 
minutes add the hot sugar and stir rapidly until it 
dissolves. It will make a hissing sound as it falls in, 
and melt quickly. Let the jelly boil up once and take 
from the stove. Have the glasses heated by standing 
tllem in hot water and pour the liquid jelly into them. 
When it is perfectly cold cover the glasses. Jelly of two 
colors and different flavors may be made with the same 
grapes by separating the pulp and skins from the 
grapes and cooking each one by itself. One will be 
purple aud the other amber. 

22. Spiced Grapes. Grapes make an excellent spiced 
fruit. To prepare them, pick from the stems 7 pounds 
of ripe grapes and separate the pulp from the skin. Put 
the skins into a preserving kettle. over the fire with 
enough water to prevent them from burning. In an- 
other kettle place the pulp and cook until it will press 
easily through a sieve to remove the seeds. Add the' 
strained pulp to the skins with % pint of sharp vinegar 
and 1 ounce each of white cloves, allspice and cinnamon. 
Boil together until it is thick and put into jelly glasses. 

23. Grape Sherbet. Grape juice makes a fine sher- 
bet. Put into a saucepan % pound of granulated sugar 
and 1 quart of water. Let it boil a few moments. Take 

-from the fire and add the juice of 1 lemon and a table- 
spoonful of gelatine that has been dissolved in a gill of 
water. When cool add % pint of juice from any dark, 
rich grape, and turn into a freezer and freeze. When 
frozen, and before you remove the beater add the white 
of an egg beaten to a froth with 1 tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar. Stir thoroughly into the sherbet. 
Cover and repack. Stand in a cool place for 2 hours. 

24. Canned Green Gages. For canning green gages 
or blue plums prick the fruit with a fork to prevent 



Preserves, Jellies and Pickles. 511 

bursting. Prepare a syrup, allowing 2 pounds of gran- 
ulated Bugar and % pint of water to every 3 pounds of 
fruit. "When the sugar is dissolved put in the fruit aud 
heat slowly to boiling point. Let it cook 10 minutes. 
Skim out the fruit and place in jars. Let the syrup boil 
another 10 minutes, then pour over the fruit and cover 
at once. 

25. Canned Blue Plums make. delicious pies for 
Winter use. -Spiced plums are fine with meats. The 
damson plums have the best flavor. To 7 pounds of 
fruit add 3% pounds of brown sugar, 1 pint of sharp 
vinegar and 1 ounce each of cinnamon, doves and all- 
spice. Scald them three times and put into jars. 

26. Grape Jelly. Take the grapes from the stems 
and rub through a sieve, stir well together and boil 
slowly for 20 minutes, then add 1 pound of sugar to 
1 pound of. juice after it has boiled for a while. Then 
boil for 15 minutes. Put into glasses, seal, and set 
aside in a cool place. 

27. Walnuts or Butternuts Pickled. Gather them 
in early summer when they are full-grown, but so tender 
that a large needle will easily pierce them all through. 
Rub off the outer skin with a coarse cloth, and then lay 
them in salt and water for a week, changing the brine 
every other day. Allow for this brine a small % pound 
of salt to a large quart of water. Make enough to 
cover all the nuts well. Place a large lid over the pan, 
and keep them closely from the air. The last day take 
them out of the brine, drain them and prick every one 
quite through in several places with a large needle. 
Drain them again, spread them out on large flat dishes, 
and set them to blacken for two days in the hot sun. 
For 100 nuts allow 1 gallon of excellent cider vinegar, 
% ounce of black peppercorns, % ounce of cloves, % ounce 
of allspice, 1 ounce of root ginger, and 1 ounce of mace. 
Boil the spice in the vinegar for 10 minutes, tied up in 
eight small muslin bags. Then take them out, aud 
having divided the nuts in four stone jars, distribute 
among tliem, equally, the bags of spice, and poUr on 
the vinegar hot, an equal portion in each jar. While 
warm, secure them with flat corks and tie leather over 
them. Done this way you may begin to use them in a

week. If you have not enough of vinegar to fill the jars 
up to the top, add some cold, and strew among the 
nuts some blades of mace. Finish with a large spoon- 
ful of salad oil at the top of each jar. 

28. Pickled Cauliflowers. Take large, ripe, full- 
blown cauliflowers. Kemove the leaves and stalk, and 
divide the blossoms into pieces or clusters of equal size. 
Throw them into a porcelain kettle of boiling water^ 
(adding a little salt) let them simmer and skim them 
well. When they come to a boil, take them up with a 

Perforated skimmer, and lay them on a sieve to drain, 
'ut them into stone jars, (three parts full). Season 
with mace and nutmeg infused in sufficient of the best 
cider vinegar, and simmer it for % hour. When it conies 
to a boil take it off the fire and pour it hot over the 
cauliflower in the jar, filling quite up to the top and 
adding sweet oil at the last.- Cover tightly. 

29. Hixed Pickles. 2 quarts of cauliflower slips, 
2 quarts of onions, English celery, carrots sliced, 300 
small pickles, 4 ounces of radish seed, 4 ounces of nas- 
turtium seeds, brine strong enough to carry an egg and 
poured over each article separately, boiling hot, and 
leave in the brine for 48 hours. Then drain and fill into 
jars or glasses. 8 quarts of vinegar, scalded, 1 quart of 
vinegar to dissolve 3 cupfuls of flour, 3 cupfuls of sugar, 
% cupful of mustard powder, 2 ounces of curry powder, 
and stir this into the boiling vinegar and pour over the 
pickles. 

30. Chow ~ Chow. % peck of small string beans, 
)i peck of tomatoes, 3 dozen ears of corn, 2 dozen very 
small cucumbers, 1 quart of small onions, 1 dozen green 
peppers, 1 head of cauliflower, % pound of white must- 
ard seed, % pound of black mustard seed, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of celery seed, ^ pound of ground mustard, 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of tumeric powder, 2 tablespponfuls of salad 
oil. 

Salt the beans, tomatoes, peppers and onions, and 
set aside for 12 hours. Make a brine for the cucumbers 
and cauliflowers, pour it over them and set aside for 
the same length of time. When all is ready to mix, cut 
the corn from the cob, mix all together in a kettle 
excepting the oil and tumeric powder, and cover the 



Beverages, ^Candies, Etc. 513 

whole with strong cider vinegar and boil 1 hour. As 
soon as done, take from the stove, add the tumeric 
powder, mixing thoroughly ; add the oil at the last, 
mixing it well with the other ingredients. This is best 
made during the first part of October. 



BEVERAGES, CANDIES, Etc. 

1. Grape Wine. The grapes should be gathered on 
a dry, clear day, after the morning dew has disappeared. 
Pick them carefully from the stems, selecting only ripe 
and perfect fruit. Mash them thoroughly, taking care 
not to bruise the seeds, as that would impart a bitter 
taste. After bruising, let the mass remain for 24 hours. 
Strain through a colander or sieve, taking care that 
there is no grease about it. Sweeten the juice (for this 
the crushed sugar is best) until it will float an egg so as 
to show about the size of a twenty-five cent piece. Put 
into jugs,fillingthem and leavingthemouthsunstopped, 
reserving a bottle of the juice to replace that which 
escapes from the jugs by fermentation. When ferment- 
ation ceases, pour the wine off into a large bowl and 
clarify in the following manner : Wash sand {% pint will 
be sufficient for 5 gallons of wine) until the water will 
run clear from it. Beat to this the whites of 4 eggs, and 
stir into the wine. When it has settled and the wine 
looks perfectly clear, pour off carefully into clean jugs, 
putting a piece of muslin inside of the funnel. Cork the 
jugs tightly and set in a cool place where they will 1 
not be disturbed until the last of October or first of 
November. 

A few days before bottling, have the bottles that 
you wish to use well washed, dried aud sunned. Provide 
new corks. Have everything in readiness before the 
bottling begins, including cement for sealing. Strain 
the wine again into large pitchers, taking particular 
care not to turn the jug back after beginning to pour 
from it, as it stirs up the sediment which is at the bot- 
tom of the jug. Cover inside of the funnel with a piece 
of muslin before placing it in the mouth of the bottle; 
fill the bottle and cork immediately, driving in the 



514 The American Kitchen. 

cork with a wooden mallet or light hammer. Never use 
old corks." Cover the neck of the bottle with cement. 
Keep in a cool, dry place. 

2. Blackberry Cordial. Put very ripe berries in a 
jar; cover them with good peach brandy. Cover well 
with oil-cloth ; let it stand a week. Strain the brandy 
from the fruit. Put in a kettle a pound of crushed sugar 
for every quart. Add spices— 1 teaspoonful of allspice, 
1 qf cinnamon and the same of cloves; , do not beat the 
spices. Pour on the sugar as much of the liquor as will 
dissolve it; as soon as it "boils up pour to the rest of the 
liquor; mix well aud bottle. 

Peach cordial is good in the same way, only cut up 
the peaches and scald them when the sugar and spices 
are scalded. Any cordial may be made in this way. 

3. Ginger Beer (Superior). To 6 quarts of water 
add 1 ounce of cream of tartar and 2 ounces of white 
Jamaica ginger; boil it 10 minutes. Strain it and add 
to the liquor a pound of loaf sugar. Put it on the fire ; 
let it simmer until the sugar is dissolved. Pour into an 
earthenware vessel, into which has beenput 2 ounces of 
tartaric acid and the rind of 1 lemon. When lukewarm 
add % tumblerful of strong hop yeast. Stir all well 
together and bottle, tie down the corks tightly. Use in 
a few days. 

4. Molasses Candy, No. 1. 1 quart of molasses, 
Y 2 cupful of vinegar, 1 cupful of granulated sugar, butter 
the size of an egg, 1 teaspoonful of soda. Dissolve 

'the sugar in the vinegar, put in with the molasses and 
butter, and boil, stirring often. As soon as it hardens 
when dropped in water it is done. Then stir the soda . 
in quickly and pour in buttered pans to cool. Pull 
until white. 

5. Molasses Candy, No. 2. 1 quart of best New 
Orleans molasses, 1 cupful of granulated sugar. Boil 
15 minutes, then add butter the size of an egg. Stir to 
keep from burning. Drop a little in cold water and if it 
hardens it is done. Before taking from the fire add 
1 teaspoonful of soda made very fine. Stir quickly, 
take from the fire and pour into buttered tins to <>ool. 
As soon as you can handle it pull whfte. 



Beverages, Candies, Etc." 515 

6. Lemon Taffy, No. 1. 3 pounds of best brown 
sugar, ]i pound of butter and 1 pint of vinegar. Boil 
all together until it hardens in water. Add 1 teaspoon- 
ful of lemon extract. Pour on buttered tins to cool. 

7. Lemon Taffy, No. 2. Put into a porcelain-lined 
preserving kettle 3 pounds of the best loaf sugar, and 
pour on it 1% pints of very clear water. When it has 
entirely dissolved, set it over the fire and add a table- 
spoonful of fine cider vinegar to assist in clearing it as 
it boils. Boil and skim it well, and when no more scum 
rises add the juice of 4 large lemons or oranges. Let it 
boil until it will boil no longer, stirring it well. When 
done, transfer it to square tin pans, that have been 
made very clean and bright, and that are slightly 
greased with sweet Oil. Set the taffy away to cool, first 
marking it with a knife while soft. Mark it in straight 
lines the broad or crossway of the pans. If marked 
lengthways the pieces will be too long. When the taffy 
is cold cut it according to the lines in regular slips, like 
coeoanut candy. Serve it up in glass dishes. 

Orange taffy is made in the same manner. These 
candies should be kept in tin boxes. 

Coeoanut candy is made in the manner of taffy, 
using finely grated eocoanut instead of lemon or orange. 

8. riaple Cream. 3 cupfuls of grated maple sugar, 
1 cupful of thick sweet cream. Boil until it hardens 
when dropped into cold water. Kemove from the fire 
and beat with a silver fork until it is of the consistency 
of very thick cream. Pour in buttered tins and when 
cool cut in squares. 

9. Chocolate Creams. 1 pound of confectioner's 
sugar, the white of 1 egg,. 2 tablespoonfuls of water, 
1 teaspoonful of vanilla; mix well and make into balls. 
Melt % cake of baker's chocolate, dip the balls into 
this and lay on buttered paper to harden. 

10. Chocolate Caramel. Take % pint of rich milk 
and put it to boil in a porcelain kettle; scrape down 
1% squares of chocolate, put it into a very clean tin cup 
and set on the top of a stove until it becomes soft. Let 
the milk boil up twice. Then add, gradually, the choc- 
olate, and stir both over the fire until thoroughly 



516 The American Kitchen. 

mixed and free from lumps. Stir in % pint of the best 
powdered sugar, and 4 large tablespoonf uls of molas- 
ses. Let the whole boil fast and constantly (so as 
to bubble) for at' least 1 hour or more, tili it is 
nearly as stiff as good mush. When all is done add a 
small teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, and transfer the 
mixture to shallow tin pans, slightly greased with very 
nice sweet oil. Set it on ice or in a very cool place, and 
while yet soft mark it deeply in squares with a very 
sharp knife. When quite hard cut the squares apart. 
If it does not harden well it has not been boiled long, 
enough or fast enough.
