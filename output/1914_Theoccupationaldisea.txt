PREFACE 

THIS work, which is the first of its kind to be published in this 
country, is designed primarily for physicians interested in the sub- 
ject of the Occupational Diseases of Modern Life, and also as a 
guide for students of social economics, social service workers, insur- 
ance actuaries, and those whose special interests deal with problems 
of labor legislation, or with workers in the chemical, textile, and 
many other manufactures or trades in which the health of the work- 
man is closely related to problems of efficiency and humanitarian 
effort.

tional diseases, notably by Drs. George M. Kober, Alice Hamilton, 
C. F. W. Doehring, Graham-Rogers, George W. Price, Frederick L. 
Hoffman, John B. Andrews, and by Mr. Edward T. Davies, Mrs. 
Linden W. Bates, and others whose work is given full recognition in 
the following text. Yet, in the Memorial on Occupational Diseases 
sent to the President of the United States in June, 1910, by the First 
National Conference on Industrial Diseases, the statement is made 
that "practically all the standard works of reference on occupational 
diseases are by English or Continental authorities. There is no mod- 
ern treatise on the subject by an American authority on industrial 
hygiene." 

To supply in some measure this lack, the present work has 
been undertaken, particularly with the aim of meeting the needs of 
American practitioners of medicine, as well as those whose indus- 
trial or philanthropic interests require a comprehensive summary of 
the nature and prevalence of the occupational disease hazards as they 
obtain in this country. 

It has come to pass that in complex modern civilization the evo- 
lution of new machinery and apparatus, new varieties of food and 
drink, new occupations and habits of life in a word, of the entire 
social environment has been accompanied by the employment of 
new poisons in the mechanical arts, new poisons of inhalation, new 
uses for the muscles, new strains of the nerves, and new stress of

INTRODUCTION 



the mind. Many of these factors operate most insidiously, others 
more acutely, but, sooner or later, tend to injure the structures of 
the body or alter its activities in a manner to produce what fairly 
may be regarded as definite occupational diseases or disorders, many 
of which affect longevity and mortality in very striking degree. 

Almost all these diseases of occupation are preventable, and this 
aspect of the subject is one which in some phase or another concerns 
the whole community ; for it presents a legislative aspect, a practical 
business side, and a humanitarian interest. Legislators should con- 
cern themselves with restrictive legislation; manufacturers, with 
practical efforts to preserve the health of their employees ; experts in 
hygiene should devise means for prevention or relief, and physicians 
and social workers should cooperate in obtaining much needed data 
on which to base a rational policy of prevention. 

In the hospitals and dispensaries of New York City, with its 
varied industries and large foreign population, is a wide field for 
the study of this subject. The writer, in the course of many years' 
connection with the visiting staffs of the New York, Presbyterian, 
and Bellevue Hospitals, and with the Cornell University Medical 
College Dispensary, has had exceptional opportunities for practice 
among such occupational diseases, particularly those which are rep- 
resented in the metal manufactures and the industries which give 
origin to many disorders of the circulatory, respiratory and nervous 
systems. 

The occupational diseases are not new diseases from the ultimate 
pathological standpoint. The arteriosclerosis or chronic nephritis 
produced by lead poisoning, for example, does not differ from that 
due to alcoholism or other toxic causes, nor does the bone necrosis 
of phosphorus poisoning differ from necrosis of other origin. Never- 
theless, in the grouping of symptoms, in their mode of onset and 
progress, as well as in their etiology, the diseases caused by industrial 



INTRODUCTION xxv 

hazards may fairly be regarded as new to medical science, and hence 
the justification for their independent classification and description. 

The subject of occupational diseases appeals to many interests, 
medical, scientific, economic, sociologic, philanthropic, insurance 
and legislative, and is just beginning in this country to command the 
attention and receive the study which its importance to the com- 
munity demands; for there are few manufactured articles of neces- 
sity, comfort or adornment which may not, in their production, have 
been associated with possibilities of industrial poison or disease 
hazard. Clothing, tools, household utensils, buildings, conveyances, 
in fact practically all the complex manufactured products of modern 
civilization, afford abundant illustrations from time to time of 
risks to health and life where the unskilled or uninstructed workman 
is permitted to deal with toxic substances or to be exposed to dele- 
terious environment. 

It is quite true that many processes of manufacture will always 
involve risk to health, as many trades necessarily involve risk to limb 
or life. One cannot handle white lead without risk of disease, just 
as one cannot use dynamite without risk of injury. Yet, in each 
case, the workman has the right of warning against the hazard, the 
right of such protection as modern scientific knowledge affords, and 
should have the right of compensation when disabled as a result of 
the lack of such warning and protection. It is easy to estimate the 
result of bodily injury or award a fixed rate of compensation for the 
loss of a life, but it is far more difficult to estimate the insidious and 
progressive effects of occupational disease, and the resulting loss of 
time or the suffering and misery not only of the workman, but of his 
family, which such disease entails. On the other hand, it is easy 
to exaggerate the hazards of particular industries, some of which 
are very serious but very infrequent, whereas others are not very 
serious but very frequent. 



xxvi INTKODUCTION 

These, then, are the problems upon which it is the aim of this 
book to throw light, it is hoped without exaggeration and in a spirit 
of fairness to employer and employee alike. In addition to full 
explanation of the etiology of the occupational diseases, their pathol- 
ogy, prevention and treatment are discussed at length. Extensive 
tables of classification are introduced and illustrations have been 
added wherever they might amplify the text. 

In presenting statistical data, although foreign sources have not 
been neglected, the aim has been in every instance in which they 
were obtainable to draw upon American reports in preference.

tional Diseases; John A. Fordyce, William Burton, and J. S. Hal-

THE OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



PAET I 

HISTORY, CLASSIFICATION, GENERAL PATHOLOGY 

AND ETIOLOGY 



I. GENERAL STATEMENTS 
DEFINITIONS 

The occupational diseases may be defined as maladies due to 
specific poisons, mechanical irritants, physical and mental strain, 
or faulty environment, resulting from specific conditions of labor. 

Such maladies may be acute or chronic. They may be the cause 
of instant death, more or less prolonged invalidism, and incapacity 
for further work, or may lay the foundation for other diseases of 
equal or greater hazard. 

They arise from a great variety of poisons, irritating substances, 
and exposure to unusual physical conditions. They are, for the 
most part, the outcome of conditions of modern life whereby new 
combinations of substances are constantly being employed in the 
arts and manufactures. Also, special uses of nerves and muscles 
are called for in the operation or control of machinery, and special 
strains result from lack of variety in work, concentration, and the 
haste involved in competition or "speeding up." In other cases, 
diseases arise from the general environment of the workman or 
from the abuse of foods and alcoholic and other beverages in con- 
nection with his special employment. 

In addition to the diseases derived primarily from hazardous 
occupations are others of importance, notably tuberculosis and pneu- 

1 



2 HISTORY 

monia, which readily assail those whose constitutions have been 

undermined by exposure to deleterious substances and environment. 

Broadly speaking, then, the occupational diseases may be due to : 

(1) Poisonous or irritant foreign substances which enter the 
body; 

(2) Conditions associated with methods of wofrk; 

(3) General unhygienic conditions surrounding the workman. 
In a general survey of the subject of industrial diseases there 

are three factors to be considered, namely: (1) the manufactory, 
(2) the worker, and (3) the worker's home. 

(1) The manufactory includes the problems not- only of the 
special hazardous substances employed, but the conditions of cleanli- 
ness, ventilation, temperature, light, hours of labor, monotony of 
work, etc. 

(2) The worker presents the problems of individual physique, 
age, sex, previous health and resistance or individual immunity. 
Besides these are the habits of the workman, especially as to the 
abuse of alcoholic beverages, his personal cleanliness, intelligence 
and willingness to adopt prescribed precautions. 

In determining the effect of metal poisons especially it is neces- 
sary to discount the possible influence of alcoholism and syphilis 
as factors in producing arteriosclerosis and chronic nephritis. 

(3) The worker's home may be so poor, ill-kept and ill-venti- 
lated, and his food so insufficient that certain diseases may arise 
from such deleterious influences rather than from the conditions of 
actual employment. 

SYNONYMS 

The occupational diseases have been variously called "industrial 
diseases," "diseases of modern life," "diseases of dangerous trades," 
"maladies of professions and occupations," and "diseases of environ- 
ment" 

HISTORY 

Occupational Diseases in Foreign Countries. The study of occu- 
pational diseases is no new subject, and two centuries ago Bernadini 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 3 

Ramazzini published a treatise in Padua, Italy, on tradesmen's dis- 
eases entitled "De Morbis Artificum Diatriba, 1713." 

In the early part of the nineteenth century the gradual substitu- 
tion of steam for water power in manufacture made it possible to 
multiply machinery and subdivide labor so that women and children 
could be employed in many industries not previously open to them, 
and to assemble workmen upon a scale unattempted before. With 
this industrial revolution began many of the occupational hazards 
which have been constantly increasing with the discovery of new 
industrial processes. 

Since that early time those foreign countries in which the sub- 
ject has received most attention, and in which the greatest educa- 
tional and legislative advance has been made, are Germany, Eng- 
land, France and Italy. In Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Switzer- 
land and Austria, also, considerable attention has been given to 
many branches of the subject. In Germany state inspection and 
control have been very far advanced, and many valuable scientific 
studies of trade disease hazards have been made. Hygienic insti- 
tutes and museums abound, where the industrial diseases receive 
due share of recognition. In Frankfort-on-the-Main a new Insti- 
tute for Industrial Hygiene was inaugurated in 1910, and there 
are others in Vienna, Budapest, Berlin, Munich and elsewhere. 

In England, owing largely to the activities of Sir Thomas Oliver, 
M.D., much has been accomplished in Parliamentary investigation, 
control and compulsory notification by physicians of many industrial 
diseases, notably those arising from lead and phosphorus, pottery 
making, textile works, caisson boring, and a variety of the more 
hazardous dust-yielding occupations. 

In 1906, the British Parliament first classed certain of the 
occupational diseases with industrial accidents for compensation 
under the Workmen's Compensation Act ; and the list of diseases 
now includes twenty-four, having been increased from a list of six. 
In addition to the above-mentioned diseases it now includes the fol- 
lowing: poisoning by nitre-derivatives of benzin (dinitro-benzol, 
anilin, and others), carbon disulphid, nitrous fumes, nickel carbonyl, 
arsenic, lead, and African boxwood; chrome ulceration, eczematous 



4 HISTORY 

ulceration of the skin produced by dust, or caustic or corrosive liquids ; 
ulcerations or epitheliomatous cancer of the mucous membranes of 
the nose and mouth produced by dust, ulceration of the skin, or of 
the corneal surface of the eye, due to pitch, tar or tar compounds; 
scrotal epithelioma; nystagmus (a miner's malady); miner's beat 
hand ; miner's beat knee ; acute bursitis over the elbow (miner's beat 
elbow) ; inflammation of the synovial lining of the wrist ioint and 
tendon sheaths; glanders; compressed air illness. 

Under the Compulsory Notification Act compensation damages 
were awarded in 1908 for the following numbers and varieties of 
cases : 

DISEASE CASES 

Lead poisoning 421 

Anthrax (wool carding) 23 

Chrome ulceration 20 

Eczema 19 

Arsenic poisoning 15 

Compressed-air illness 10 

Nitro and amido-derivatives of 

benzin poisoning 10 

Ankylostomiasis 6 

Epithelioma 6 

Mercury poisoning 3 

Phosphorus poisoning 1 

Since that time in one year damages were awarded in over 2,000 
cases of occupational diseases arising from ten of the hazardous sub- 
stances enumerated by Parliamentary act. 

Germany also has made marked progress in employers' liability 
acts which, in many instances, cover pecuniary responsibility for 
diseases, as well as accidents, acquired in dangerous trades. 

In France, in addition to the prohibition of the use of poisonous 
phosphorus, a notable achievement has been the partial control of 
lead poisoning by substitution of zinc oxid in the making of much 
of the white paint that is used. Industrial Museums of Safety

various sorts, illustrative both of occupational accidents and diseases 
and their mode of production, have been established in fourteen of 
the larger European cities (See Figs. 1 and 2), nearly all of which 
are supported by the state. In 1906 was held the first International

credit of establishing the first and thus far the only hospital for the

stitution is so important as to merit detailed description, which is 
given on page 8.

manifold evils such as were shown by the result of the recent Dia- 
mond Match Congressional investigation, which excited such wide- 
spread interest. The Census Bureau has lately issued a partial 
classification of one hundred and one diseases of hazardous occupa- 
tions under which death returns or other statistics should be grouped. 
The States of Illinois and New York have established special com- 
missions to investigate the problems of the occupational diseases in 
greater detail. 

In 1907, the Massachusetts State Board of Health exhibited in 
Boston a series of ninety photographs illustrative of occupational 
disease hazards, which were again presented at the Sixth Inter- 
national Congress on Tuberculosis in 1908. 

The United States Bureau of Labor, in Bulletin No. 86, 1910, 
published a translation of a list of industrial poisons prepared for 
the International Association for Labor Legislation by Dr. Thomas 
Sommerfeld, Sir Thomas Oliver, M.D., and Dr. Felix Putzeys. 
This list, lately revised in Germany, has been translated and pub- 
lished as Bulletin No. 00, May, 1912, by the United States Bureau 
of Labor. It comprises brief notes on forty-nine poisons only. 

June, 1910, was signalized by the meeting in Chicago of the first 
National Conference on Industrial Diseases, and in a memorial sent 
to President Taft by this Conference it was stated that there occur 
annually in the United States 13,400,000 cases of sickness among 
artisans and craftsmen, many of which are attributable to occupation 
hazards, involving a total annual economic loss of nearly three- 
fourths of a billion dollars. A second meeting of this Conference 
under the auspices of the American Association for Labor Legisla- 
tion was held at Atlantic City in June, 1912, and at a joint meeting 
with the Section on Hygiene and Public Health of the American 
Medical Association valuable summaries were presented of different 
phases of the occupational diseases. A noteworthy feature of this 
meeting was the presentation, in cooperation with the New York 
State Factory Commission, of a pictorial and diagrammatic exhibit 
of many of the hazardous trades. It is intended to organize this 
exhibit as a "traveling exhibit," after the manner of those so suc- 
cessfully employed in the anti-tuberculosis campaign. 



7 

In 1907 the Massachusetts State Board of Health presented a 
similar pictorial exhibit in Boston, illustrating hazardous conditions 
in textile and other industries. The States of Massachusetts, Ohio, 
New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota are col- 
lecting photographs and charts upon a large scale illustrating indus- 
trial disease hazards. 

In New York City is a small but instructive Museum of Safety, 
where models and illustrations are gathered of appliances for pre- 
vention of accidents to workmen, and within the year this museum 
has begun a collection to illustrate the causes of occupational dis- 
eases as well, such, for example, as samples of the dust inhaled by 
the grinders of meerschaum pipes, makers of files, etc. For this 
purpose it has imported a duplicate of the Sommerfeld collection of 
noxious trade dusts, etc. 

Among the States which have lately become active in gathering 
data upon the occupational diseases and which, through their labor 
bureaus, factory commissions and boards of health, have issued bul- 
letins upon special occupational conditions investigated, are Illinois, 
Massachusetts (since 1904), Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, 
Wisconsin and Connecticut. 

A number of independent organizations have established com- 
mittees for the study of the occupational diseases. Such, for ex- 
ample, are the New York Academy of Economic and Social Sci- 
ence and the New York branch of the American Chemical Society. 

In November, 1911, I organized in New York City an informal 
committee with the object of studying the occupational disease situ- 
ation, both local and general, and especially for cooperating with the 
State Labor Bureau in furtherance of its investigations. This com- 
mittee was composed of experts in industrial chemistry, medicine, 
mortality statistics, and employers' liability, labor legislation, social 
service, the science of economics, and philanthropic service; and 
this method of organization may be recommended to those desiring 
to pursue the study of the occupational diseases in other large centers 
of industry. The committee was subsequently absorbed by the New 
York Association for Labor Legislation as its official committee on 
the occupational diseases. This committee has already gathered 



8 HISTORY 

much valuable material with a view to formulating prophylactic 
legislation and extending a campaign of education regarding indus- 
trial disease hazards. 

In September, 1912, the International Congress of Applied 
Chemistry, meeting in Washington, devoted a part of its meetings 
to a discussion of the metal poisons in the trades, and at the same 
time and place the International Congress on Hygiene and Demog- 
raphy discussed various phases of the occupational diseases as they 
occur in different States. 

Among the intensive investigations of industrial diseases already 
made in this country which are especially noteworthy are the admir- 
able study made in Illinois by Dr. Alice Hamilton on the subject 
of lead poisoning ; that by Mrs. Lindon W. Bates on mercury poison- 
ing in the felt hat industry in New York and New Jersey; that by 
Dr. Emery R. Hayhurst on brass poisoning ; that by Dr. W. C. Han- 
son on dusty trades in Massachusetts ; those by Dr. Graham Rogers 
on the industry of potteries, bakeries, calico printing, and the cloak- 
making trade; and that upon phosphorus poisoning in the match 
industry by Dr. John B. Andrews, which later led to such brilliant 
results in prohibitive legislation by Congress. The latter investigator 
has also contributed a valuable study of lead poisoning in New York 
State. 

All these recent activities are proof that the subject of the occu- 
pational diseases is at last receiving in this country the thorough 
scientific, statistical and critical study which its great importance 
commands. 

THE MILAN HOSPITAL AND CLINIC FOR OCCUPATIONAL 

DISEASES 

The Milan hospital and dispensary for the study of occupational 
diseases, operated in connection with a large institute of research 
having a staff of twelve investigators, is the first complete institution 
of the kind anywhere established. It was inaugurated April 10, 
1910, and in the first eighteen months of service treated 415 hos- 
pital and 2,400 dispensary cases, among which were 136 of chronic 
lead poisoning, 71 occurring in painters. 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 9 

The institution, under the direction of Prof. L. Devoto, is ad- 
mirably appointed, and every detail as to treatment, diet, physical 
examinations and clinical laboratory tests is well carried out. The 
building contains a library of all publications relating to occupa- 
tional diseases; a museum of cheniical products, dusts, and all 
hazardous materials used in industries ; chemical and physical lab-

oratories ; and six clinical wards with a capacity of twelve beds each, 
with additional isolation rooms, making the total hospital capacity 
eighty beds. There are a large dispensary and a pathological de- 
partment with laboratories and a lecture hall. There are rooms 
for animal experimentation, X-ray photography, physiological chem- 
istry, clinical microscopy, calorimetry, etc. Apparatus is installed 
for the study of electro-cardiograms, hydraulic pressure, analysis of 
the explosive and other toxic gases, air analysis, microspectroscopy, 
microphotography, ergography, etc. 

Among the functions undertaken by this institution are the 
visiting in their homes of artisans affected by industrial diseases 
who may be unable to attend the clinic ; the instruction of the f ami- 



10 MORBIDITY 

lies and friends of industrial workers in hygiene and the recognition 
and avoidance of special occupational hazards; the publication and 
distribution of leaflets of instructions; the holding of popular con- 
ferences to discuss occupational hazards ; the instruction of students 
in special courses of occupational hygiene, diagnosis, laboratory 
analysis, occupational diseases of the circulatory, respiratory, 
osseous, nervous and cutaneous systems, and of the eyes ; radiography 
and occupational diseases transmissible from animals to man, the 
relationship of tuberculosis, syphilis and alcoholism to occupational 
diseases, and the duties of the physician in relation to such dis- 
eases. The construction of a similar hospital and institute for occu- 
pational diseases, with a capacity of 300 beds, is being planned in 
Budapest, and one is very much needed in this country. 

MORBIDITY STATISTICS 

Many of the occupational disease data reported at the present 
time are based upon antiquated observations, to which nothing new 
has been added for many years, and a fine opportunity is open for 
the more scientific study of these diseases in the light of modern 
diagnostic methods. This is especially true in regard to the results 
of inhalation of respiratory irritants in relation to the ultimate 
acquisition of tuberculosis; for it is primarily through the point of 
view of the modern study of tuberculosis rather than that of occupa- 
tion that many facts have been brought to light. 

The first National Conference on Industrial Diseases held in 
Chicago in 1910, adapting to the United States the sickness insur- 
ance of the German industrial population, sent a memorial to the 
President calling for controlling legislation and estimating that 
there were in this country in 1910, 

13,400,000 cases of sickness among the 
33,500,000 men, women and children engaged in gainful 
occupations in the United States, repre- 
senting 

284,750,000 days of sickness, and 
$366,107,145 loss in wages. 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 11 

Of course not all of these cases of sickness were due in any man- 
ner to occupation, for they include such diseases as typhoid fever 
and influenza and many others which are in no sense occupational; 
for such figures mean that more than one-third of all men, women 
and children employed are ill on an average of almost a month 
out of each year. To anyone familiar with modern factory con- 
ditions it is apparent that such data are misleading and based on 
wrong premises ; for there are very many factories in which the tally 
books show an almost clean bill of health for a year. If this is 
true in many factories, it would raise the average of illness in others 
so high as to put them out of commission if these wholesale statistics 
were accurate. They may serve in a sensational manner to influence 
legislation, but are of little use from a scientific point of view. It 
is well known that there are, unfortunately, no accurate morbidity 
or mortality statistics recorded for the entire United States, and to 
compute over thirteen million cases of illness from the few accur- 
ate data here and there obtainable is purely guesswork and is scarcely 
in the interest of scientific knowledge. Most of the statistical esti- 
mates heretofore made of workingmeii's illness are mixed with in- 
dustrial accidents on the one hand and with ordinary non-occupa- 
tional diseases on the other. As a matter of fact, it is often ex- 
tremely diificult to determine proper limitations. For example, an 
epidemic of influenza may attack the employees in a certain fac- 
tory. Some will acquire the disease who were in previous good 
health, others may acquire it because anemia, overwork and like 
conditions resulting directly from their occupation combine to lessen 
their resisting power. Others may acquire it because their alcoholic 
habits, poor food or unhygienic home conditions have similarly 
reduced their resisting power. Others, again, may remain im- 
mune despite adverse conditions. The net result, however, is 
so many cases of illness among so many workmen, but it is 
manifestly unfair to take this net figure of cases of illness as 
an indication that the occupation is especially hazardous. Occu- 
pational disease statistics should be confined to those diseases 
which are distinctly and solely due to occupation, and should 
not include the factors of home environment, undesirable habits, 




12 MORBIDITY 

etc., except in separate discussion. In many cases, as, for 
example, with lead poisoning, this can be done readily, but as yet 
such data in other industries do not exist on a scale which warrants 
gross estimates of all the occupational diseases in this country. 

In this book an attempt has been made to recite all the varied 
symptoms which may possibly occur in each of the more important 
industries. But I would warn against the exaggerated conclusion 
that these symptoms are universal, or in many cases even frequent. 
In fact, in many cases they are so infrequent as sometimes to fail 
of proper interpretation as to their etiology. Far from implying 
that the health of the industrial workers of the country as a whole 
is deteriorating, it is distinctly improving in very many industries 
in which the risks to health and its safeguards are constantly being 
better understood. Nevertheless, there is still a vast amount of 
preventable and, therefore, unnecessary illness, and it is only 
through better understanding of all the possible hazards that further 
improvement is to be attained. Some industrial diseases, like some 
industrial accidents, are bound to occur among the millions of indus- 
trial laborers of the country; for one cannot handle poisons, as one 
cannot handle explosives, without incurring risks. But watchful- 
ness, training and instruction as to the possible dangers involved 
are as important in the one case as the other, and hence the reason 
for grouping them collectively for reference and study, for upon 
such foundation only can permanent progress in prevention be made. 

Morbidity statistics are constantly varying with the varying con- 
ditions of industries. For instance, the morbidity from lead poison- 
ing in typesetting and pottery glazing has, in the past decade, stead- 
ily diminished, owing to improved industrial conditions; but in the 
storage battery and automobile painting industry a serious new field 
for it has arisen. 

The relative proportion of the occurrence of the industrial dis- 
eases as compared with each other is difficult to determine in other 
than the most general terms. In the yearly report for 1910 of the 
Koyal Industrial Commission of Sachsen-Meiningen the relative 
number of cases was found to vary as four to one, those furnished 
by textile industries ranking as four, the stone and pottery indus-

tries as two, and as one each the chemical industry, leather and 
similar stuffs, and wood industries. This research, however, re- 
ferred only to ninety-one establishments, obviously not an exhaustive 
basis for comparison. 

Some idea may be obtained of the relative predominance of dif- 
ferent types of disease among industrial operatives from the follow- 
ing table of 1,925 cases collected in the Milan Clinic, in 1910-1911, 
by L. Carozzi, and published in "II Lavoro" (1911, vol. iv, nos. 19- 
21).

MORTALITY STATISTICS 

Some highly dangerous trades may produce immediate fatal 
effects, but do not give rise to chronic ailments ; such, for example, 
is the effect of using in a confined space shellac dissolved in wood 
alcohol. Other trades may possess both the danger of immediate 
death and also give rise to chronic poisoning, depending on the 
quantity of poison absorbed ; such, for example, are trades in which 
illuminating gas constitutes the hazard, as in working in sewers 
into which it has escaped. Other trades, again, may produce seri- 
ous incapacitating lesions which become progressive after the work- 
man has left the trade. In such cases the mortality may appear 
lower than is the actual fact, because in a statistical enumeration 
only the men still employed in the trade are taken account of. 



14 



MORTALITY 



Hence, some of the most dangerous trades may have an apparently 
lower mortality than those in which the danger acts more insidiously, 
or as compared with the mortality of those who do not work in trades. 
For example, workers in lead, arsenic or mercury may quit their 
trade and die some time afterward as a result of the industry, their 
places being filled by healthy workmen who lower the rates of both 
morbidity and mortality in those trades. 

For these reasons great care must be exercised in accumulating 
statistics to determine the duration of the hazardous employment 
and the subsequent career of the workmen who have left it. Fred- 
erick L. Hoffman, statistician of the Prudential Life Insurance Com- 
pany, stated at the First National Conference on Industrial Diseases, 
June 10, 1910: 

"The most serious impairment of all statistical investigations of 
this kind results from the effect of occupation selection, or the elimi- 
nation of those who have been impaired as the result of occupational 
activity in unhealthful trades and who subsequently find employ- 
ment elsewhere. The tendency of modern times is rather to increase 
this impairment of statistical investigation into morbidity and mor- 
tality because increasing intelligence on the part of industrial work- 
ers suggests, at an earlier date than formerly, a change of employ- 
ment for the purpose of physical betterment." 

The National Bureau of Labor gives the mortality rate among 
workmen in the dusty trades as follows:

In a recent longevity table issued from the Registrar-General's

GENERAL STATEMENTS 15 

years of age, and based upon the unit of 1,000, the ratio for the 
following classes of occupation was : 

Filemakers 1,810 

Plumbers, painters and glaziers. . . . 1,120 

Printers 1,096 

Fishermen 845 

Ministers 533 

Workmen in general were snown to live less than half as long as 
the leisure class. 

In the United States census returns of 1909 (page 30), covering 
the 18 States comprised in the "Special Registration Area," there 
were reported 86 deaths from chronic lead poisoning, and, under the 
vague heading, "other occupational and chronic poisonings," with- 
out further specification, were 140 deaths of males and 127 of 
females, making a grand total for the year of 353 cases of deaths 
from chronic occupational poisoning. Acute poisonings are not 
specified in detail, but deaths from "poisonous gases and other acci- 
dental poisonings" (exclusive of suicide cases, which are separately 
classed) are given as a total of 3,616. How many of these were of 
occupational origin is guesswork. That this list is an understatement 
there can be no doubt in the present rudimentary condition of statis- 
tical data in this country ; for many deaths are classed under "pneu- 
monia" and other general diseases in which the primary or under- 
lying cause of death was undoubtedly some occupational poisoning. 
I know of at least three deaths from acute lead poisoning in smelting 
works which were returned by physicians under other diseases, and 
a case of fatal methyl alcohol poisoning from using shellac dis- 
solved in wood alcohol which was returned as "epilepsy." After all, 
the total direct deaths from occupational poisonings are always 
numerically insignificant in comparison with the morbidity figures 
from the same cause, and with the number of patients who would 
not have died from pneumonia, nephritis, tuberculosis and other 
general diseases but for the foundation of serious lesions of occupa- 
tional origin. 



16 MORTALITY 

Further illustrations of the difficulty of drawing really useful 
conclusions from mortality statistics are furnished from the Special 
.Registration Area returns in the United States Census of 1908, 
Bulletin 104. Here it is shown that out of every 100 deaths of 
occupied males, 25 to 34 years old, 30.9, or nearly one-third, were 
caused by pulmonary tuberculosis. With this figure as a standard 
for comparison, tuberculosis deaths in selected industries were as 
follows : 

Compositors and printers 49.2 

Boot and shoemakers 44.1 

Bookkeepers 41.9 

Tailors 41.2 

Barbers 40.1 

Farmers 25.6 

Miners and quarrymen 5.3 

From such a table one might infer that miners and quarrymen, 
as compared with compositors and printers, lead a charmed life as 
far as tuberculosis is concerned, but later in life the death rate for 
compositors and printers lessens by comparison with that of the other 
trades. Moreover, as stated in the Census, "It does not follow that 
the death rate from tuberculosis of the lungs is in reality lower 
among miners and quarrymen, for example, than among printers. 
The very high ratio of deaths from accidents (62.1 per cent.) of 
miners and quarrymen would greatly reduce the relative importance, 
but not necessarily the absolute death rate, of tuberculosis for this 
occupation, as compared with the printers, who have only a low 
ratio (7.3 per cent.) from external causes." 

In other words, if a miner 25 or 30 years of age is killed by an 
explosion he is not going to die a lingering death from tuberculosis. 
In the absence of an autopsy, it cannot be affirmed that he had no 
tuberculosis. Again, if he be not killed, but maimed by accident, 
he may seek other employment, and still be tuberculous. The com- 
positor leads a life of less vigorous exercise, largely sedentary, and 
has certain temptations as to drink, etc.,, which do not beset the 
miner in like degree.

This illustration is given merely in protest against the 
lax quotation of mortality statistics which perhaps may be re- 
versed in the next decade of life, or completely offset by other 
conditions of employment than appear from a bald statement of 
figures. 

Physicians in this country have not yet acquired the habit of 
properly reporting deaths from industrial poisoning, and either 
omit reference to the particular trade entirely, giving only some 
immediate cause of death, such as pneumonia, or state the trade in 
such general terms that no conclusions of value are to be drawn. 
For example, to give the occupation as "glass worker" conveys little 
or no information, for the man might be a glazier with lead poison- 
ing, a cutglass grinder with pneumonoconiosis from emery dust, or a 
glass blower with emphysema. 

General mortality statistics compiled for the state of Massachu- 
setts for a period of 42 years which comprise all workers of or over 
25 years of age illustrate to some extent the relative harmfulness of 
trades, but conditions of industry have changed so much in this period 
that such figures can have only very limited value. These figures 
are quoted as follows:

Hoffman states: "Estimating the death rate among American 
wage-earners at only 10 per 1,000, and applying this rate to the 
33,500,000 wage-earners estimated for the year 1910, there occur 
annually 330,500 deaths among them, and of this number certainly 
one-fourth are due to diseases or accidents more or less preventable." 

CLASSIFICATION 

In order to establish a satisfactory classification of the occupa- 
tional diseases and the industrial hazards which give origin to them, 
it is necessary to agree upon a standard nomenclature which may 
prove not only of scientific value, but constitute a working basis for 
such remedial legislation as may prove desirable. The authority 
for such nomenclature and classification is properly vested in the 
United States Bureau of the Census, which, being a national insti- 
tution, is better fitted for this work than the local municipal or 
state boards of health or labor bureaus. Agreement as to uniformity 
among the latter would obviously involve much time and discussion, 
with probably less satisfactory ultimate results. 

The Bureau of the Census already furnishes a generally accepted 
classification of the causes of death from ordinary diseases and 
includes a number of causes of death from occupational diseases, 
about one hundred of which are enumerated in the Mortality Statis- 
tics Bulletin No. 108, 1909, page 33. But this list does not include 
diseases which are non-fatal nor all of those which frequently are 
fatal. It is understood, however, that the Bureau of the Census is 
at present cooperating with the Committee of the American Medical 
Association on the Nomenclature and Classification of Diseases, and 
it is to be hoped that they will find time to include in this work the 
formulation of a complete classification of the disease hazards and 
deleterious substances which are causatively related to the industrial 
diseases irrespective of mortality statistics. 

In the absence which exists at this time of a complete and authori- 
tative classification of the occupational diseases as they obtain in 
this country, the classification herewith submitted is intended as a 
convenient working basis merely, and must be subject to much future 
revision as knowledge of the subject increases. 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 19 

There is an enormous number of cases of chronic invalidism 
which produce greater or less incapacity for work and lay the foun- 
dation for many fatal diseases not primarily caused by occupation, 
but which are engrafted upon constitutions enfeebled by harmful 
trades. Thus, the polisher of glazed pottery may not die of the 
immediate effects of plumbism or of inhalation of flint or other 
sharp dust particles, but his arteries, kidneys or lungs may become 
so damaged that he almost inevitably dies if exposed to the germs 
of pneumonia or tuberculosis. Such a case should be classified as 
follows : 

(1) Major occupation: potter. 

(2) Detailed hazard: lead poisoning, or dust inhalation (speci- 
fying the variety of dust), as the case may be. 

(3) Immediate cause of death: pneumonia or tuberculosis. 

(4) Contributing cause of death : arteriosclerosis, nephritis, or 
pneumonoconiosis. 

(5) Degree of alcoholism or of chronic non-toxic maladies 
present. 

(6) Age and sex. 

(7) Duration of employment. 

Whereas the occupational diseases do not differ in their ultimate 
pathological changes from the ordinary medical diseases as grouped 
in medical textbooks (with very few exceptions), they might be 
grouped in the conventional manner as diseases of the 

(1) Blood 

(2) Circulatory system 

(3) Respiratory system 

(4) Digestive system 

(5) Nervous system 

(6) Muscular system 

(7) Bones 

(8) Cutaneous system 

(9) Urinary system 
(10) Special sense organs 



20 CLASSIFICATION 

Such grouping, however, does not serve the essential purposes of 
emphasizing their peculiar etiology, and merely differentiates occu- 
pational diseases from the occupational surgical accidents and in- 
juries. It is, therefore, desirable to adopt a brief general classifi- 
cation comprising (A) the main groups of harmful substances, (B) 
the harmful conditions of environment, and (c) the special injuries 
to the tissues and organs of the body arising from such substances, 
environment, or other conditions of labor. This brief classification 
is submitted as follows : 

GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 
AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES 

A. Harmfu I Substances : 

1. Metallic poisons 

2. Toxic gases, vapors, and fumes 

3. Toxic fluids (acids, alkalies, dyes, petroleum products, etc.) 

4. Irritant dusts and fibers 

(a) Insoluble inorganic dusts 

(b) Soluble inorganic dusts 

(c) Organic dusts and fibers 

5. Organic germs (anthrax, glanders, etc.) 

6. Miscellaneous irritants 

B. Harmful Conditions of Environment: 

1. Air compression and rarefaction 

2. Excessive humidity 

3. Extreme heat and cold 

4. Excessive light (electric, X-ray, etc.) 

C. Occupational Injuries: 

(Medical) 

1. Injuries to the blood 

2. Injuries to nerves, muscles and bones 

(Strain, fatigue, cramp, faulty positions, "occupational 
neuroses,'- blows, vibrations, pressure, etc.) 



GENEKAL STATEMENTS 21 

3. Injuries to the eyes 

4. Injuries to the ears 

5. Injuries to the mouth, nose and throat 

6. Injuries to the skin 

Under these major headings may be grouped practically all of the 
irritant substances, yet certain difficulties arise even in this ele- 
mentary arrangement. For example, lead, which of course would 
be classed as a simple metal poison, is also, when heated, to be 
ranked among the toxic fumes, and again, in the form of filings, as 
a soluble inorganic dust. As this applies to many of the other 
metals, to repeat them all under each subheading would be cumber- 
some. Phosphorus, for instance, is a metalloid ; yet it is as a toxic 
fume that it works such havoc, and it had better be classed with' the 
latter. 

Furthermore, the names of many substances may convey no inti- 
mation of their special hazards. For example, whether ferrosilicon 
be classed among the metals as containing iron and traces of arsenic, 
or in solution as a liquid, since by itself it is non-toxic, neither of 
these groups would suggest its real hazard, which consists in the acci- 
dental access of water, producing the combination arseniuretted 
hydrogen gas that has cost many lives, especially on ships in which 
the ferrosilicon was being transported. 

For such reasons it would seem best to class each sub- 
stance primarily in the major group, which its most com- 
mon form and use suggest, and, when its common name conveys 
.no idea of the hazard, to indicate the latter in parentheses. Thus 
ferrosilicon might be grouped under toxic metals, and a paren- 
thesis should follow, reading "arseniuretted hydrogen gas, on hydra- 
tion." 

The attempt to name pulmonary fibrosis in accordance with its 
etiology is entirely unnecessary, as the lesion is the same, no mat- 
ter what may have been the original irritant. Thus coal miner's 
phthisis has been called "anthracosis," that of iron or steel-workers 
"siderosis," of flint-workers, "chalicosis," of clay-workers, "alumin- 
osis," and even that of tobacco-workers has been given the ridiculous 



22 CLASSIFICATION 

name, "tabaccosis." The nomenclature of the occupational diseases 
is complex enough without such unscientific additions. 

A harmful substance may produce a single disease, as steel dust 
may cause knife-grinder's phthisis, or pneumonoconiosis. More often, 
especially if the substance be soluble, it may produce a variety of 
diseases or lesions. For example, chronic lead poisoning may cause 
arteriosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy (compensatory), chronic ne- 
phritis, chronic anemia, encephalitis, or neuritis. Mercury may 
cause not only bone necrosis, but anemia, and a series of grave 
nervous and mental disorders. Similarly, a harmful condition of 
environment may beget a single lesion, as when electric light injures 
the eye, or it may cause a variety of diseases, as in the case of 
extreme heat and humidity. Obviously, therefore, a classification 
based upon the disease alone is less complete than one based upon 
the etiological factors as above given. 

Another method of approaching the subject is by grouping the 
hazardous trades. While this serves a certain purpose, it is open 
to many objections. In the first place the number of hazardous 
trades is exceedingly numerous and constantly increasing, whereas 
the toxic substances and conditions of harmful environment are 
fairly definite and understood. There are, for example, fully 150 
distinct trades in which lead in some form constitutes the essential 
hazard. 

Secondly, the particular trade may give rise to varied diseases, 
either because of the combination of substances used, as in brass 
poisoning (brass being an alloy of copper and zinc with traces of 
lead), or because the work in the trade itself is so subdivided. For 
instance, a workman classed merely as a "potter" may be employed 
in glazing or polishing and acquire lead poisoning; or, as in the 
Limoges works in France, he may be a grinder subject to inhalation 
of silica dust, and may acquire fibroid phthisis and subsequently 
tuberculosis ; or as a molder he may be exposed to constant humidity 
and may suffer from rheumatism or chronic bronchitis. Obviously, 
to class him solely as a "potter" supplies information so incomplete 
as to be almost useless. Other terms are still more ambiguous. For 
example, a "hatter" may be engaged in the non-hazardous occupation 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 23 

of selling hats, may be a maker of straw hats, associated either with 
no hazard or with the minor one of using some bleaching substance 
or inhaling straw dust, or may be a man who is employed in making 
felt hats. This latter industry is so subdivided that the man may 
rank as a blocker, blower, pouncer, flanger, curler, shearer, stif- 
fener, singer, trimmer, coner, dyer, dryer, feeder, hardener, mixer, 
welter, or finisher. In about half of these labors he would be sub- 
ject to no hazard whatever, as, for instance, if he be a curler or 
finisher; but if he be a fur-cutter, "maker" or sizer he is very sus- 
ceptible to bronchial irritation and liable to add to the tuberculosis 
mortality. If, on the other hand, he be a pouncer, he is almost 
certain to acquire chronic mercurial poisoning and sooner or later to 
become wholly incapacitated for work, and he may possibly die as a 
result of his labor. In the wool industry a workman may be a sorter, 
picker, dyer, scourer, carder, slubber, crabber, napper, loom fixer, 
comber, fuller, sizer, warp dresser, etc. To specify all the subdi- 
visions of labor in a complex industry is to accumulate a catalog 
of many thousands of technical terms and easily to become lost in a 
maze of phraseology. It is precisely in this understanding of tech- 
nical work that physicians as a body need education, for upon them 
must devolve the collection of disease data, if such data are to be 
confirmed by accurate diagnoses. It is not customary, as yet, to 
give systematic instruction in medical colleges upon occupational 
diseases. Most of the standard textbooks on medicine refer to 
scarcely a half dozen of the industrial poisons, such as lead or arsenic, 
and the literature of this topic adapted for use in this country is 
scattered mainly in isolated monograuhs and a few brief journal 
articles. 

Hospital and dispensary statistics are for the most part so lack- 
ing in this detailed information as to the exact nature of the work- 
man's employment as to make it exceedingly difficult to collect com- 
prehensive data as to the extent and distribution of occupational 
hazards; yet, if legislative control or educational preventive meas- 
ures are to be inaugurated, it is of prime importance that such 
data be collected upon a truly scientific basis. 

Before a standard classification of occupational diseases is 



24 CLASSIFICATION 

adopted, attention should be given to the educational needs of the 
situation. A classification which is too elaborate may fail of its 
chief purpose, which is to interest physicians in this important 
humanitarian, scientific, and legislative work, i. e., the' control and 
mitigation of the occupational disease hazards. It is desirable, 
therefore, to furnish physicians and employers with a simple general 
classification, after the form outlined in this article, and to supple- 
ment it with a more elaborate classification to be supplied to special 
investigators in hospitals and dispensaries, or to those who have 
access to the study of large groups of cases. It is clearly undesirable 
that hasty or unfair legislation, based on insufficient data, should be 
enacted, and it is therefore of the greatest importance that physicians 
everywhere enter into hearty cooperation with the state authorities 
in the collection of accurate statistics which shall be of true scien- 
tific value. 

As an aid to meet the educational requirements of classification 
in New York State, I have furnished the State Labor Bureau with 
a brief general classification of occupational hazards and harmful 
substances, to be printed on the backs of the notification blanks 
required by law to be sent to each physician. I also furnished a 
more elaborate classification which is printed in small booklet form 
and is designed for distribution to hospitals and dispensaries, social 
service workers, and all physicians who will take interest enough to 
gather special data. As far as possible this classification is ar- 
ranged in four parallel columns, headed respectively, ' 'Harmful 
Substance," "Industry Where Prepared or tTsed," "Mode of En- 
trance into Body," "Diseases or Symptoms." This list, considerably 
amplified, is reproduced in the Appendix. 

A similar list comprising fifty-four poisons of hazardous trades 
has recently been published in Germany by the International Asso- 
ciation for Labor Legislation and translated by Dr. William H. 
Rand for publication in Bulletin No. 100 of the United States Bu- 
reau of Labor (May, 1912). 

For my own use and that of my assistants in hospital and dis- 
pensary work, I have designed history cards with headings calling 
for classified data, one set for the metal poisons, another for the dust 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 25 

and fiber irritants, etc. From such uniformly classified cards it is 
easy to compile scientific data for any particular group of diseases. 
These cards read as follows :

In recording the history of a case upon this card inquiry is made 
as to the existence of chronic alcoholism and syphilis, because these 
conditions act strongly as synergists in predisposing to metal poison- 
ing of all kinds. The chewing gum or tobacco affords a ready means 
of introducing the poison into the mouth with soiled fingers. Inquiry 
is made regarding the workman's wife's miscarriages, because such 
accidents have occurred as a result of chronic plumbism in the 
male.

Many of the occupational diseases have become so familiar to 
workmen that they have given special names to them, such as, 
"painters' colic," "painters' palsy" or "drop-wrist," "brass chills," 
"potters' rot" (phthisis), "miners' asthma," miner's "beat hand" 
and "keens," "phossy jaw" (of match-makers), "hatters' shakes" 
(mercurial poisoning), the caissonmen's "bends" and "chokes," 
"knife-grinders' phthisis," "shoddy fever" (among garment work- 
ers), "benzene drunk." Other diseases, very insidious but very nu- 
merous, pass unrecognized by the workman, at least in so far as he 
correctly attributes them to their origin. 

A striking illustration of the lack of attention usually given to 
the increasingly large and important group of occupational diseases 
is the fact that the only occupational poisons (apart from anthrax 
and glanders) which are mentioned in the International List of the 
Causes of Death, republished by the United States Bureau of the 



GENERAL STATEMENTS 27 

Census in 1910, are three, namely: chronic lead, phosphorus and 
mercury poisoning. 

Such important causes of death as chronic poisoning by anti- 
mony, arsenic, and numerous gases, vapors and fumes, acids and 
dusts are placeable only under the single heading of "other chronic 
occupational poisonings." The only division under which deaths 
from many acute poisons such as ferrosilicon, methyl alcohol, ar- 
seniuretted hydrogen, hydrofluoric acid, and a host of others may 
be placed is the single general heading, "other acute poisons." Work, 
however, is in present progress upon a thorough international classi- 
fication of all the occupational diseases. 

In the Milan Clinic the industries are grouped for purposes of 
study as follows (L. Carozzi, "II Lavoro," 1911, vol. iv, nos. 19-21) : 

(1) Chemical 

(2) Mineral and metallurgical 

(3) Electrical 

(4) Woodwork 

(5) Stonework, cement, etc. 

(6) Construction and transportation 

(7) Agricultural 

(8) Textile 

(9) Garment making 

(10) Foodstuffs 

(11) Animal and vegetable materials 

(dyestuffs, fertilizers, gela- 
tin, etc.) 

(12) Cartographic 

(13) Rubber and tobacco 

(14) Miscellaneous (compressed air, 

divers, firemen, etc.) 

THE MOST HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS 

The question arises with occupational diseases as it often has 
with occupational injuries or accidents, as to which are the most 



28 CLASSIFICATION 

hazardous occupations? It may be answered partially, at least, as 
follows, and as applying to the industries of this country : 

(1) Occupations producing the greatest number of victims of 
chronic poisoning are those of the lead industries. Of these, painters 
especially those applying enamel paints and sandpapering the 
successive layers form the numerical majority of victims, but those 
working in storage-battery making and white and red lead produc- 
tion present the most serious lesions. Next ranks the pottery in- 
dustry, from the numerical point of view. 

Sir Thomas Oliver has said that, "next to white and red lead 
industries, the trade which gives the largest number of victims of 
plumbism is that of china and earthenware." 

(2) Occupations producing the most serious chronic lesions, 
either deforming or incapacitating, are first of all the poisonous 
phosphorus match industry (now, however, practically abolished by 
law), next the felt hat industry, or such part of it as exposes the 
worker to mercuric nitrate; the lead production industries (smelt- 
ing, paint making, etc.), storage-battery making, sandblasting and 
emery-wheel grinding. 

(3) Occupations most likely to produce acutely fatal results 
are those of compressed air workers, varnishers using wood alcohol, 
workers in toxic gases, especially carbon monoxid, sulphuretted and 
arseniuretted hydrogen, carbon bisulphid, nitrous acid and nitrous 
compounds, anilins. Beyond these very general statements it is im- 
possible to classify the relative frequency of the different occupa- 
tional diseases in much detail because of great variations in local 
conditions and the many complex factors which enter into the 
problem. 

A similar list, issued by the Italian Ministry of the Interior in 
1895, divides the most hazardous industries into two classes, accord- 
ing to their virulence. The first group comprises fifty-six industries 
and the second sixty-two. (This list is published in Dr. Giovanni 
Allevi's admirable work, "Le malattie dei lavoratori e 1'igiene in- 
dustriale," Milan, 1908.) 

Accurate governmental estimates of frequency of illness among 
workmen classified by occupations have been made earlier and more 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 29 

thoroughly in Austria than anywhere else. For the five-year period, 
1891-1895, 32 occupations of males between 15 and 60 years of age 
were studied (H. Schneider, "Gefahren der Arbeit in der chemi- 
schen Industrie," s. 13). For every 100 such workmen there were 
42 cases of illness of all sorts during this period on an average of 
all 32 industries, but in the chemical industries (making and use 
of acids, pigments, chemical supplies, etc.) there were 170 cases, or 
a preponderance of 70 per cent, more cases. 

Weyl has shown by statistics covering fifteen years, from 1888 
to 1904, that in the chemical industries only twelve employees per 
100 remain free from illness throughout the year, whereas in all 
industries combined sixty can be reckoned as remaining healthy. 

Leymann has shown by statistics covering twenty-three years 
that occupational diseases are thirty-five per cent, more common 
among chemical industries than among other industrial groups. 

In Germany, in 1907, 172,441 persons were employed in the 
various chemical industries which may present disease hazards, 
such as the production and use of acids, alkalies, pigments, chemical 
supplies, explosives, fertilizers, etc., representing an increase in 
twenty-five years of 140 per cent. (H. Schneider, "Gefahren der 
Arbeit in der chemischen Industrie," s. 1). 



H. GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

GENERAL PATHOLOGY 

The industrial poisons may enter the body or irritate the ex- 
ternal surface. The ports of entry are through the nose and respira- 
tory system, through the mouth and alimentary canal, and by absorp- 
tion through the skin. Some poisons enter by one channel alone, 
but others may enter by all three, according to the nature of the 
occupation or of the toxic substance. On entering the body the 
poison may produce localized _ irritation or inflammation of the 
mucous membranes or lung tissue, or general systemic symptoms on 
being absorbed into the blood or lymph channels. The pathological 
changes produced are various, but chiefly fall under the headings of 



30 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

inflammation, fatty degeneration, necrosis, and cirrhosis. These 
lesions may be either acute, subacute or chronic in character. Elimi- 
nation of the toxic materials takes place, according to their nature, 
through the lungs, kidneys, and perspiration. An excess of poison- 
ous substances swallowed may be eliminated with the feces. Some 
poisons, such as certain metals and the inorganic insoluble dusts, 
may be stored in the tissues or organs of the body for a very long 
time, or permanently. The most seriously toxic substances, on being 
absorbed, may produce chemical reactions with the body tissues, 
and many of them are hemolytic, causing rapid disorganization of 
the blood, particularly of the red cells. 

The local reactions produced by the industrial poisons chiefly 
affect the conjunctival, buccal, and nasal mucosa and the skin, caus- 
ing a variety of changes, such as inflammation, necrosis and ulceration 
with vascular and nerve disorders. 

Chronic cutaneous irritation in rare instances may give rise to 
new growths such as epithelioma. 

ACUTE AND CHRONIC POISONING COMPARED 

In reviewing the effects of the various industrial poisons they may 
be divided into acute, subacute and chronic phenomena ; but, as far 
as the individual poison is concerned, its effects very often come 
under each category, and in chronic cases a prolonged exposure to 
the poison seems to be of as much or more importance than the size 
of the daily toxic dose. Some poisons, chiefly those among the 
toxic gases, vapors and fumes, act exclusively in very acute man- 
ner, and practically never chronically. Such, for example, are 
methyl alcohol vapor, sulphur vapor, etc. Others, either from the 
nature of the industry or that of the substance itself, act only insidi- 
ously or chronically, like silver nitrate. Others may act either 
acutely or chronically, according to the size of the dose, like carbon 
monoxid, or according to the physical form of the substance, like 
metallic lead as a fume which causes acute symptoms, and lead as 
a salt or other compound which may be very chronic in its effects. 
As Straub says, "Acute poisoning is a physiological experiment; 



GENEKAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 31 

chronic poisoning is a disease," or, broadly speaking, one might 
say that acute poisoning causes disturbance of functions; chronic 
poisoning causes histological changes or lesions in organs and tissues. 
For example, acute mercurial poisoning disturbs the gastro-intestinal 
and renal functions, but chronic mercurial poisoning acts mainly 
through lesions of the central nervous system. Acute arsenical 
poisoning is not unlike cholera in its symptoms, but chronic arsenical 
poisoning acts as insidiously as tuberculosis. 

As it is more easy to recognize immediate physiological distur- 
bances than the onset of subtle organic changes, it often happens 
that the effects of chronic industrial poisoning proceed to a serious 
extent before they are discovered, and as the victims of chronic 
poisonings far outnumber those of acute forms, the matter becomes 
of great importance, and every effort should be made to secure means 
of early diagnosis. Moreover, by virtue of their long duration, the 
influences of chronic poisons have more opportunity to be associated 
with, as well as confounded with, many other disease agencies, such 
as alcohol, syphilis, inadequate food, foul air, etc., factors which 
often seriously complicate or obscure diagnosis. 

The specific selection of many industrial poisons for definite 
structures of the body is an exceedingly interesting and highly ob- 
scure phenomenon, analogous to that of many drugs. Thus methyl 
alcohol elects the optic nerve; the carbon monoxid of illuminating 
gas poisoning, the lenticular and caudate nuclei; phosphorus, the 
bones of the jaw; chromates, the cartilages of the nose; lead, the 
tunica media of the arteries, etc. In some of these instances (as 
shown under their respective headings) these phenomena have been 
explained, but in many others the selective action is a problem which 
awaits further research for solution. 

ARTERIOSCLEROSIS 

Arteriosclerosis and the resulting cardiac hypertrophy is one 
of the commonest of all the lesions of the diseases arising from 
occupation, particularly among workers with the poisonous metals 
and those whose occupation involves much strain of the circulation, 



32 GENEKAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

as in the muscular effort of lifting heavy weights. For these rea- 
sons, as well as from the fact that it is greatly enhanced by alcohol- 
ism and syphilis, it is far more common among men than women. 
In my service in Bellevue Hospital, composed chiefly of members of 
the laboring class, artisans, etc., it is no exaggeration to say that 
almost every hard-working man forty years of age presents decided 
evidence of arterial thickening, and if, in addition, he is alcoholic 
or syphilitic, the sclerosis may be well marked at thirty-five or even 
thirty years of age. It is often only one manifestation of a general 
sclerotic process in middle-aged men, evidenced by emphysema and 
cirrhosis of the liver, kidneys and heart. With the arterial thick- 
ening, and no doubt associated with it in a causative relationship, 
is high arterial tension, which in the absence of organic heart dis- 
ease is usually 160 mm., or in many cases 200 mm. or more. 
Among elderly men, i. e., those in the eighth decade of life or more, 
who belong to the group of workers under discussion, extensive 
atheroma of the arteries is exceedingly common, and the service 
always presents well-marked examples of the broken "pipe stem" 
type of calcareous deposit in the radial and other superficial arteries. 

Arteriosclerosis, incurable when once well established, may only 
be arrested to some extent from progressing by methods of treat- 
ment which, unfortunately for the workingman, rarely come within 
the possibilities of his purse. He cannot take the rest which he 
needs, and often cannot alter his occupation. It is, however, most 
important that the metal worker who shows beginning arterial hard- 
ening and persistent high blood pressure should change his work if 
possible, or, if not, that he should take exceptional precautions to 
avoid saturation of his body with the poison. This is particularly 
true of all workers in lead production, painters, etc. Equally true 
is it of those whose work involves the constant strain of lifting 
heavy weights or other forms of strenuous muscular exertion. 

It is further desirable to restrict proteid intake as much as 
possible, and the more nearly the victim of arteriosclerosis can come 
to vegetarianism without becoming anemic or losing strength, the 
better. A good rule for the workingman is to allow him red meat 
only two or three 'times a week and only once a day each time. At 



GENEEAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 33 

other meals he may eat fish, bacon or eggs in lieu of beef or mut- 
ton. Water drinking, also, should be directed, so that too much 
fluid is not taken into an empty stomach and absorbed so promptly 
as to raise the blood pressure. Frequent sweating is desirable, and, 
if it is not produced incidentally to the work itself, it may be in- 
duced once or twice a week by a hot bath before retiring, or, if the 
patient can afford it, by a Turkish or electric light bath. The 
patient should be cautioned against unnecessary hurry, much stair 
climbing, and all serious muscular strain. 

The bowels should be kept active. The patient should diet with 
coarse cereals (hominy, oatmeal, Graham or bran bread) or laxative 
fruits (prunes, oranges, apples), and a five-grain blue pill or other 
cathartic should be prescribed once in a week or ten days. Medicines 
in general, in my experience, avail little in this condition. It is a 
very old custom to give potassium iodid. This may be of benefit in 
cases complicating syphilis, but otherwise it does not appear to do 
more than disorder digestion. Thyroid extract I have tried ex- 
tensively, but it produces no lasting effect in reducing arterial ten- 
sion where the high tension threatens complications, gives rise to 
dyspnea, etc. Five-grain doses of chloral four times a day with 
purgation produce more relief than nitroglycerin or other remedies. 
When the arteries are greatly thickened it is difficult to reduce the 
tension by medication so long as the patient is obliged to keep at 
work and cannot take the rest which is so important for reducing 
the work of the heart 

FIBROID PHTHISIS 

Fibroid phthisis is produced by the mechanical irritation of 
constantly inhaled hard, sharp particles of such substances as sand, 
glass, emery, flint, brick dust, cement, granite, sandstone and other 
stones, iron and steel dust and filings, brass filings, diamond 
dust, etc. 

The morbid process is a chronic interstitial inflammation of the 
lungs, usually most intense at the apices, but to a considerable ex- 
tent found elsewhere. The lung is pervaded with minute nodules, 
so that the freshly cut surface feels rough and grates upon the knife. 



34 

Within the nodules are permanently imbedded the irritating sharp 
particles. The bronchial and mediastinal glands are similarly filled 
with the disseminated particles which have been conveyed to them 
by leukocytes. These lesions are not of themselves alone liable to 
prove fatal, but they so weaken the resisting power of the lungs as 
very strongly to predispose to chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema 
and particularly to tuberculosis. There are, however, cases in which, 
after the original irritation and inflammation have subsided, if the 
occupation be changed, no further injury results. 

Nothing can be done by way of treatment to remove the imbed- 
ded particles, but much may be done to lessen further irritation and 
consecutive disease. 

Recently considerable controversy has arisen over the theory 
advocated by Vilaret, Calmette and others that pneumonoconiosis is 
of intestinal origin, dust being swallowed and absorbed by the 
intestinal lymphatics, whence it is conveyed to the mediastinal and 
bronchial lymphatic glands. Experiments with guinea pigs fed 
upon coal dust in which the carbon has been traced to the lungs are 
cited in support of this view. This theory has not been generally 
accepted, although it is well known that in coal miners particles of 
carbon may be widely distributed to different organs through the 
lymphatic system and active agency of the phagocytes. 

ACTION OF METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 

The mode of poisonous action of the metals and their com- 
pounds is very varied, and the effects are both general and specific, 
acute and chronic. Broadly considered, the specific effects are more 
important than the general, and the chronic than the acute, both 
numerically as to the number of workmen affected and as to the 
permanence of the lesions produced. The metals may enter in 
pure form and be dissolved in the body, or, as various salts or other 
compounds, they may gain access to it in solution. They also may 
enter as dusts or in volatilized form. Lead affords one of the best 
illustrations of all four methods of poisoning. Iron and steel, on 
the other hand, act solely as mechanical irritants to the respiratory 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 35 

system and eyes when in the form of dust or fine grindings. With 
the exception of iron, heavy metals are foreign to the tissues of the 
body and have no part in its functions. Other normal ingredients 
of the body, such as sulphur, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, cal- 
cium and magnesium act mainly in the industries as fumes or in 
irritant solutions, and their effects are described under those head- 
ings. The present section, therefore, deals only with the poisonous 
heavy metals and their compounds. 

Some of the heavy metals, like gold, appear to lack any definite 
toxic action upon the body, at least as far as their industrial use is 
concerned, and in general the poisonous effects of any metal, in dis- 
tinction from purely mechanical irritation as a dust, depend upon 
its degree of solubility in the body and the power of the blood and 
tissues to absorb it. In other words, it is not so much a question of 
how much of a metal enters the body, but how much of it is ulti- 
mately absorbed. The same metal may be much more actively 
absorbed in one of its physical states than another. Lead as a 
volatilized fume, for example, is far more toxic than it is in its 
various solid compounds, and the latter also differ greatly in rate 
of absorption. Moreover, there is often personal idiosyncrasy 
regarding toxicity from metals. One painter, for example, may 
handle lead paint for a score of years without special precautions 
and yet escape being incapacitated by plumbism, whereas another 
may succumb to the poison within six months. It is this fact which 
often makes it difficult to convince workmen of the value of precau- 
tionary measures. In many cases, too, the effects of metal poison- 
ing are so insidious that much organic change may be wrought in 
the tissues or organs of the body before the victim is aware that 
any harm has been produced. In such cases the metal poisoning 
may merely open the way for other diseases, such as tuberculosis, 
to act, and the underlying poisoning is overlooked in the presence of 
more definite disease symptoms. 

Although the various metal poisons produce quite characteristic 
lesions, many of them affect a number of different organs in the 
body, and one or another organ may be affected in very different 
degree. For example, in chronic lead poisoning the predominating 



36 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

symptoms may be manifest either in the kidneys, arteries, hlood 
or nervous system, just as is the case with chronic alcoholism, or 
in another person all the symptoms may be present simultaneously. 

The mode of action of the metal poisons is through transmission 
by the blood, to which they gain access either by entering the lungs 
in the form of volatile fumes or as dusts, or by entering the aliment- 
ary canal by being swallowed. In the latter, which is the more fre- 
quent mode for many heavy metals and their compounds, they gain 
access to the mouth by means of dust inspired or conveyed to the 
mouth by unclean fingers, contaminated food or by fingering chewing 
tobacco. 

The researches of Prof. K. B. Lehmann and two Japanese pupils 
in Wiirzburg conducted upon animals have demonstrated that as 
much as three-fourths of an inhaled dust may enter the stomach 
rather than the lungs, being either directly swallowed or retained in 
the nasal, buccal and pharyngeal cavities for a time and swallowed 
later. 

Once within the system, the metal compounds may either retain 
their original composition or be altered by various chemical reac- 
tions such as that of the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice. In 
some cases the metals themselves may be deposited in various organs 
of the body, such as the liver, lymphatic glands, etc. This is notably 
true of lead and arsenic. 

The metals possess, above all other industrial poisons, the prop- 
erty of producing serious organic changes, particularly of the type 
of sclerosis, while acting in exceedingly minute doses through long 
periods of time. The result is that, although the victim may 
recover from the more acute symptoms, the organic changes of per- 
manent nature place the body in a weakened condition and render it 
much more vulnerable to other diseases, especially those of germ 
origin. 

The heavy metals, in so far as they are not deposited perma- 
nently in the body, leave it principally by means of the kidneys, 
as is the case with lead and arsenic, for example. Lead, also, may be 
eliminated through the sweat glands in very minute quantity, as 
shown by the black sulphid produced by sulphur vapor baths. 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 37 

GENERAL, SYMPTOMS OF POISONING BY THE HEAVY METALS 

Acute Poisoning. Acute poisoning by the heavy metals when it 
occurs in the industries is usually the result of the inhalation of 
fumes, such, for instance, as arise in lead or zinc smelting. Nervous 
symptoms and digestive disorders predominate, naturally, also, with 
much bronchial irritation, and the victim may die in a comparatively 
short time from cardiac syncope. Such cases, fortunately, are rare. 
Recent experiments upon animals have shown that the injection into 
the blood of fine metallic particles may give rise to chills. 

Chronic Poisoning. Chronic poisoning possesses certain symp- 
toms in common for many of the heavy metals and their compounds. 
Prominent among them is pronounced anemia. There is also much 
disturbance of the alimentary system, such as anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting and constipation. In the nervous system common symp- 
toms are headache, vertigo, visual disorders, and marked tendency 
to neuritis, palsies, muscular weakness and atrophy. The kidneys 
often give evidence of irritation. Specific symptoms are numerous 
and constitute a very interesting study, being often difficult of ex- 
planation, although very constant and definite. They are fully 
described under the account of the action of the individual poisons, 
but prominent among them are those due to the particular distribu-^ 
tion of the nerves or muscles affected, the production of bone and 
joint lesions, the deposit of certain metals in the gums, peculiar 
ulceration of the mucosa, etc. 




These effects are largely specific for each substance, for most of 
the volatile irritants produce diagnostic symptoms. The effects are 
more often acute and the symptoms more urgent than is the case 
either with dusts or metal poisons in non-volatile form. This is 
owing to the ready solubility of many gases and vapors in the blood 



38 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

and the consequent distribution of the poisons throughout the body. 
In some instances, however, the effects are chronic and insidious, 
everything depending upon the degree of dilution of the poison in 
the atmospheric air. But there are some effects produced in com- 
mon, and these will first be considered. 

General Effects. These are due in part to replacement of oxy- 
gen in the air inspired by the toxic substance, and by depriving 
such air of its subtle inherent qualities of "freshness" and purity. 
In part, they are due to irritation of the epithelium and nerves of 
the respiratory mucosa, and in part to the added factor of extreme 
heat with which many vapors and fumes are inhaled, as in smelting 
and chemical processes of various, kinds. 

Specific Effects. The specific effects vary all the way from the 
intensely corrosive action of acid fumes to the insidious action of 
such colorless, odorless and therefore imperceptible gases as carbon 
monoxid and dioxid. Fortunately, many of the most poisonous 
volatile substances possess easily recognizable characteristics. Some, 
in fact, like ammonia vapor and sulphur fumes, are so intensely 
irritant as to produce immediate respiratory spasm and thus auto- 
matically, so to speak, prevent deeper inhalation which would prove 
fatal. The specific effects may be either acute or chronic. 

ACUTE EFFECTS. The acute effects may act more promptly 
than any other form of industrial poison, as when the vapor of 
hydrocyanic acid causes instant death. The effects vary very much, 
but collectively they are manifested principally upon (1) the eyes, 
(2) the respiratory system, (3) the blood and circulation, (4) the 
digestive system, (5) the nervous system, and in a few instances 
(6) the bones. 

(1) The eyes are irritated intensely by strongly acid or alka- 
line fumes, fumes of coal tar products, and many of the metallic 
fumes. Lacrimation, smarting and burning pain are followed by 
congestion and intense conjunctivitis. The fumes of wood alcohol 
produce amblyopia and may cause permanent blindness. Some of the 
sulphurous fumes and fumes arising in brass foundries may cause 
temporary double vision and other ocular disturbances. On the 
other hand, many very toxic gases, like carbon monoxid, have no 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 39 

effect upon the eyes or vision other than might accompany serious 
weakness from any cause. 

(2) The respiratory system is greatly irritated by strongly acid 
and alkaline fumes, vapors of turpentine and similar organic com- 
pounds, and fumes of metals. Coryza may be produced and dryness 
and burning, with a disagreeable taste, may affect the mouth. The 
pharynx and larynx may be inflamed, with painful choking sensa- 
tions, and spasm of the epiglottis and vocal cords. Acute bronchitis 
frequently results from the volatile irritation and sometimes broncho- 
pneumonia, in extreme cases. There may be pulmonary hemor- 
rhage and often edema of the lungs. 

A former assistant in my laboratory, Dr. W. G. Hudson, has 
made a special experimental study upon animals of the effects of 
acid fume poisoning. Exposure to a variety of toxic acid fumes 
was found almost invariably to produce pulmonary edema when 
inhaled in massive doses. He states : "The usual secondary symp- 
toms which have been so fatal are the result of a pulmonary edema 
which the acid fumes excite. This pulmonary edema shows no 
pathological difference from the pulmonary edema met with in 
general medical practice, although it occupies a rather unique posi- 
tion in being a simple, uncomplicated pulmonary edema, while that 
met with in medical practice is always secondary to some other 
disease. 

"But the experiments show in addition that when the exposure 
has not been sufficient to cause pulmonary edema it may easily be 
sufficient to be the exciting cause of a lobar pneumonia." 

On the other hand, some of the toxic gases, like carbon monoxid 
and dioxid, are completely inert as regards local manifestations of 
irritation, and, like the anesthetic vapors, act only upon the system 
as a whole after inhalation. 

(3) The blood and circulation are more or less affected by all 
the volatile poisons which are capable of absorption. Such absorp- 
tion may take place in any part of the respiratory system, and is 
usually extremely rapid. Many of the most seriously poisonous 
gases and vapors are actively hemolytic, producing rapid disintegra- 
tion of the blood. Some, like illuminating gas, produce a fixed com' 



40 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

bination with the hemoglobin (methemoglobin) which permanently 
prevents the red corpuscles from carrying oxygen to the tissues. 
Some of the sulphurous compounds like sulphuretted hydrogen gas 
act in this manner and may be hemolytic as well. The heart may 
be paralyzed by direct poisoning or by deprivation of proper blood 
supply. Some vapors, like those of the nitrogen compounds, are 
also vasodilators. 

(4) The digestive system is indirectly affected by many vola- 
tile poisons which often cause vomiting, and sometimes diarrhea. 

(5) The nervous system, including the brain, may be affected 
directly or indirectly through the hemolytic blood. Common symp- 
toms are vertigo, headache, general muscular prostration, paralysis, 
and coma or convulsions. In illuminating gas poisoning cerebral 
softening may result from a curious localization of thrombosis in 
branches of the middle cerebral artery. 

(6) The bones illustrate other curious localized action, as in 
the necrosis of the jaws in poisoning by white (or yellow) phos- 
phorus vapor, and necrosis of the cavities of the teeth and of the 
lower jaw in mercury vapor poisoning. These vapors, also, have 
profound toxic effect upon the central nervous system. The fumes 
from chromic acid, which are not violently toxic to the system at 
large, give rise to a localized necrosis of the cartilaginous portion 
of the median septum of the nose, with ulceration of the soft parts 
adjacent. 

CHRONIC EFFECTS. Chronic effects of many of the toxic gases, 
vapors and fumes arise from the long-continued inhalation of minute 
quantities. They are manifested chiefly by marked anemia and 
digestive disturbances, and sometimes, as in the case of mercury 
and phosphorus poisoning, by nervous and mental disturbances, such 
as chills (as in the brass-founders' ague) or "shakes," tremors, pal- 
sies, loss of memory, and mental confusion and depression. 

ELIMINATION 

After absorption the toxic gases, vapors and fumes may be 
eliminated by the lungs, or form various compounds in the body, 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 41 

or pass off in more or less altered form by the urine, as in the case 
of turpentine vapor, which, after inhalation, imparts a strong odor 
of violets to the urine. Sulphuretted hydrogen gas imparts its odor 
to the urine and other secretions and may be smelled in the breath 
long after it has been inhaled. Hydrocyanic acid gas, when not 
immediately fatal, imparts an odor of bitter almonds to the urine 
and breath of the victim. 

ACTION OF ACIDS AND TOXIC FLUIDS 

GENERAL EFFECTS OF ACIDS, ALKALIES, DYESTUFFS, PETROLEUM 
AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS 

The effects of irritant fluids are, in the main, local and exerted 
upon the cutaneous surface, although some of them give off fumes 
(which are elsewhere described). These irritants may be spat- 
tered into the eyes or mouth, causing local hyperemia, congestion 
and inflammatory reaction. 

Their chief toxic action, however, is through local irritation of 
the skin, and exceptionally, through sufficient absorption, to give 
rise to mild constitutional symptoms. Naturally the bare hands and 
arms afford the surfaces in immediate contact with this form of 
irritants ; but, through leaning over various receptacles of the fluids, 
the skin of the face may be affected by spattering or they may be 
conveyed to it by the moist hands, which in the male often, also, 
convey the irritants to the skin of the penis and scrotum in the act 
of micturition. The clothing, too, often becomes saturated with 
the fluid irritants, causing cutaneous irritation over large surfaces 
of the body. The numerous varieties of skin lesions thus produced 
are described in detail in the section on Diseases of the Skin. The 
effects of the irritants are often heightened by excessive heat of the 
fluids, by pressure and friction of the skin incident to the particular 
form of work, by the rubbing into the folds of the skin of various 
kinds of dirt, oil from machinery, etc., and by prolonged macera- 
tion in moisture. 

Although some of the fluid irritants cause more or less harden- 
ing of the skin, the softer lesions produced are characterized by 






42 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 



marked tendency to recurrence, for in general the resistance of the 
skin becomes permanently lowered. 



ACTION OF DUSTS 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF DUST INHALATION 

Dusts act upon the organism in five principal ways: 

(1) By mechanically obstructing the air passages; 

(2) By lacerating the delicate mucous epithelium; 

(3) By conveying soluble toxic materials into the system; 

(4) By conveying germs; 

(5) By acting as irritants upon the skin, choking the sweat 

and sebaceous gland ducts and irritating the epithelium. 




FIG. 4. PROTECTED EMERY GRINDING WHEELS. These have dust aspirators 
below connecting with large dust exhaust tubes into which the steel, iron, 
or emery dust is drawn downward as the wheel revolves. 

The dust content of the air is a fair measure of its purity, and 
J. Rambousek goes so far as to state that "where no dust is there 
are no bacteria in the air." 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 43 

Although the noxious dusts differ somewhat in detailed effects 
upon the organism, they have certain general effects in common. 
These may be either acute, causing prompt irritation reflexes, such 
as cough, increased secretion of tears, etc., or subacute or chronic, 
causing congestion and inflammation of the mucous membranes of 
the respiratory passages. It is a common experience for workmen 
when first entering a dusty trade to suffer severely from acute 
coryza, with sneezing and lacrimation, and sometimes slight febrile 
reaction. These symptoms pass off after a few days of exposure to 
the irritant, but may recur on resuming work after a brief holiday 
or the enforced idleness of a strike. 

Dusts are irritating to (1) the skin, (2) the eyes and (3) respira- 
tory passages, and may enter (4) the alimentary canal. 

1. The Skin. Upon the hands and arms dusts may give rise to 
pruritus, erythema and eczema. Mixed with sweat and working 
into the deeper folds in the skin, they may give rise to ulceration, 
and, exceptionally, to epithelioma. 

2. The Eyes. The sharp insoluble dusts irritate the cornea, in 
time giving rise to ulceration. Conjunctivitis, lacrimation, con- 
junctival swelling and ulceration may be produced, and some of the 
soluble dusts may cause pustular inflammation. The vessels of the 
elbow) ; inflammation of the synovial lining of the wrist joint and 
painful, so that in many cases work is seriously interfered with. 

3. The Respiratory Mucosa. The Schneiderian membrane is 
much irritated. It may become congested and swollen, the hyperse- 
cretion of mucus is common in the earlier stages of irritation. In 
some cases there is ulceration with formation of dry crusts over the 
surface of the ulcers which cause bleeding on removal. 

Some of the soluble dusts are absorbed in the mouth, producing 
local or constitutional effects of poisoning. The larynx may be 
irritated. Cough is common and there may be hoarseness. Thirst 
is also a common symptom. Acute and chronic bronchitis are the 
usual result of persistent inhalation of irritant dusts. 

Many dusts do not penetrate very deeply into the lungs, not 
beyond the first or second bifurcation of the bronchi, but the heavier 
metallic dusts, such as steel filings, and especially sharp insoluble 



44 GENEEAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

dusts like spiculse of silica, emery, etc., in time give rise to pneu- 
monoconiosis. The bronchitis is, to a certain degree, protective, for 
the tenacious mucus expectorated brings out much dust which other- 
wise in time would tend to .occlude the air cells. The wandering 
phagocytes often pick up insoluble particles and convey them to 
deeper parts of the body. In coal miners, for example, particles 
of carbon are uniformly deposited in the bronchial and mediastinal 
glands, and may be carried as far as the liver and deposited there. The 
constant bronchial irritation, as well as pneumonoconiosis, strongly 
predispose to acquisition of tuberculosis. Asthma and emphysema 
are other common results of continued inhalation of injurious dusts. 
The soft organic dusts, such as minute fibers of hair, feathers, etc., 
may convey germs into the lungs, and give rise to pulmonary abscess. 
The more serious forms of dust inhalation greatly impair the gen- 
eral health, owing to pulmonary irritation, purulent bronchial secre- 
tion and defective oxidation, so that the victim becomes anemic and 
emaciated. 

4. The Alimentary Canal. The soft organic dusts and hard, in- 
soluble inorganic dusts, when caught in the secretions of the mouth, 
may be swallowed in considerable quantity, but do not produce any 
symptoms of consequence. The soluble mineral dusts, however, 
composed of pulverized metals and their salts, when conveyed into 
the alimentary canal, are absorbed and produce typical organic 
symptoms. Most of the cases of lead and arsenic poisoning, for 
instance, are produced in this manner. 

ENVIRONMENT AND HABITS OF LIFE 

This problem, both in its general and specific aspects, greatly 
complicates the study of the occupational diseases, particularly 
when the question arises as to legislative control. In some instances, 
no doubt, especially in the case of garment-workers, the conditions 
of work may be hygienic, but the home in a crowded, filthy tenement 
may be so insalubrious that enforcement of tenement house regula- 
tions, or the economic problems of shorter hours of work, better 
wages and better food may be much more important than any special 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 45 

hazard arising from the nature of the employment itself. The 
strained, overworked, underfed employee who sleeps in an inside 
bedroom at home, or with closed windows and possibly a gas stove 
to further pollute the air, will acquire symptoms difficult to dis- 
tinguish from those of a dusty trade, for example, or one in which 
he is exposed to noxious gases and vapors. 

The problems of environment, therefore, resolve themselves into 
the following subdivisions, in addition to the nature of any specific 
poison to which the workman may be exposed :

1. General Conditions. In many instances poor ventilation in 
low-ceiling rooms with windows kept always closed; the accumula- 
tion of dust and dirt on floors, rafters and machinery, or damp 
floors, are responsible for the ill health of employees, who, with the 
same occupation conducted in dry, well-aired, clean rooms, remain 
well and develop much greater efficiency. The provision of adequate 
washing facilities, water closets and opportunities for removing 
overalls so that they do not have to be worn home when impreg- 
nated, for example, with lead dust or dyes, are other factors of 
much importance in influencing general health. 

2. Specific Conditions. The specific conditions concern the air, 
as to its purity, humidity, temperature and other qualities, light and 
the odors resulting from the manufacture of certain products. 

a. AIR PURITY. The air surrounding the workman may be 
impregnated with dust or toxic gases, although the general con- 
ditions of ventilation of the workroom are good, and the use of blow 
fans and exhausts, dust shields and similar apparatus becomes essen- 
tial to protect the lungs from injury. The air pressure may be 



46 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

excessive, as with work in caissons or diving, although the air itself 
be pure. 

b. HUMIDITY. The humidity of the air which the workman 
may be forced to breathe becomes a special hazard wherever much 
steam is set free, or in evaporation processes, or where the floor of 
the workroom is liable to be constantly wet. In the pottery trade, 
bleaching, tanning and dyeing processes, and many similar trades, 
excessive moisture is a necessary accompaniment of the material 
handled, and humidity of the air often becomes extreme. In some 
trades, such as laundering and the washing of many articles of 
manufacture, the hands and forearms, and sometimes much of the 
body, are almost constantly soaked in water, which is not without 
effect upon the general health, as well as the cutaneous surface. The 
most desirable humidity for the workroom is 55 to 65 per cent., and 
where artificial ventilation is used the air should be renewed three 
times per hour. 

c. EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE. Here the environmental haz- 
ard may consist in passing constantly from one extreme of temper- 
ature to another, in remaining in the extreme cold and damp, for 
instance, of the interior of a large cold storage plant, as butchers do 
in large beef-dressing establishments, or in exposure to intense heat, 
either with or without steam. Stokers, firemen, bakers, kiln men, 
smelters, puddlers, glass blowers, pottery makers and workers in 
many other trades are thus exposed, with resulting effect upon 
the skin, eyes, respiratory passages, circulation and kidneys. The 
excessive perspiration induced leads to concentration of the urine; 
and, if the workmen pass suddenly into the outer air in winter, the 
surface of the body becomes chilled and congestion of the lungs or 
kidneys sometimes ensues. 

d. LIGHT. Excessive light acts mainly upon the eyes and skin, 
causing superficial burns of the skin, congestion and inflammation 
of the eyes, etc. 

e. ODORS. Many industries result in the production of odors 
which are extremely unpleasant, if not nauseating, to those unac- 
customed to them. The worst of these are connected with handling 
animal products, such as hides in tanneries, bone fertilizers, fat 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 47 

reducing, lard refining and soda manufactories, etc. Other nuisances 
are the odors emanating from gas works, petroleum refineries and a 
variety of chemical works. 

Distinction should be made between the odors of volatile sub- 
stances and the really toxic material which such substances may con- 
tain ; for repugnant odors are not harmful per se, else the workmen 
employed in tanneries, for example, which give off notoriously un- 
pleasant effluvia, would suffer from them instead of being the un- 
commonly healthy set of workmen they often are. W. C. Garrison, 
in a report on the leather industry in the State of New Jersey, 
writes on this topic: "Although thorough examinations have been 
made to determine the effect of offensive odors in the factories or 
about the neighborhoods in which they are operated, the only con- 
clusion reached regarding any one occupation has been of an entirely 
negative character. No special unhealthfulness could be traced to 
foul smells, although there is authority for believing that such 
offensive vapors may cause something in the nature of a deterioration 
of the general health of those who inhale them, and thus bring 
about conditions that may be favorable to the development of con- 
tagious diseases." 

I have known the evil emanations from a petroleum refinery 
to awaken persons from sound sleep when the wind bore them in a 
certain direction, and foul odors undoubtedly irritate and destroy 
the rest and appetite of those unaccustomed to them; but, beyond 
this, they are incapable of harm even when derived from sewage or 
offal, unless accompanying decomposition gives rise also to toxic 
gases, which are often themselves inodorous. 

3. Home Conditions. The workman who goes home to a scanty 
meal, wearing clothing steeped in perspiration and the fumes, dust 
or solutions of toxic materials in which he has been working, and 
who sleeps in a close, dirty apartment in which he hangs his reeking 
clothes, carries much of his occupational hazard with him, if it be 
of toxic nature. If, furthermore, he is tired out from long hours 
of work or the strain of "speeding up," or depressed by anxieties 
over low wages and other conditions, he is in poor condition to re- 
sume work on the morrow. He thus in time becomes anemic and weak, 



48 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

suffers from anorexia and digestive disorders, and arrives at a state 
in which he becomes more and more susceptible to whatever hazard 
there may be in his special work, a hazard which may be insignifi- 
cant for one in better physique. 

These are not all conditions which can ever be controlled by 
legislation, but are largely to be remedied through education of the 
workman in personal and home hygiene, and by such moral and 
social influences as may be brought to bear upon the situation. No 
small part of this responsibility lies with the medical profession, 
whose instructions are often heeded by the workmen who disregard 
general advice from laymen. This has been noticeably true in the 
prevention of tuberculosis, and there is no reason why it should not 
be so in many matters connected with industrial hygiene. 

RELATION OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES TO INDUSTRIAL 

INJURIES 

The United States has been much slower than many of the for- 
eign countries, notably England, Germany and France, to recognize 
in any official manner the deleterious effects of hazardous trades or 
industries. Of the two great divisions of tfre industrial hazards, 
(a) industrial disease and (b) industrial injuries or accidents, the 
latter has been the first to claim attention, and the studies made in 
this subject, as well as the regulation by preventive and other legis- 
lation, have antedated, by a number of years, similar interest in the 
disease hazards. This is due, no doubt, to the much greater definite- 
ness and clearer limitations of accidents as compared with disease; 
especially as viewed by laymen. A man's hand lies upon the work- 
bench, cut off by a revolving saw nothing could be more definite 
as to the relationship of cause and effect. He recovers from the 
injury, and it is easy to determine the degree of his incapacity for 
further work. The condition is self-limited and non-progressive. 
With industrial disease, on the other hand, many complex factors 
arise. It is claimed that a workman is the victim of chronic lead 
poisoning; but are his arteriosclerosis and nephritis due exclusively 
to lead poisoning or are alcohol, syphilis or gout the underlying 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 49 

causes ? Is his neuritis due to arsenic or alcohol ? To what extent 
has there been contributory negligence ? Was he tuberculous before 
lie undertook work in a pottery, or did his work contribute to the 
disease ? Is the mercurial poisoning of which he is the victim likely 
to continue its destructive effects until the victim dies, or is he 
likely to recover completely upon cessation of his hazardous work? 
Are his chronic bronchitis, anemia and malnutrition due to chronic 
gas poisoning acquired as a garment presser, or are they due to 
defective hygiene at home, poor food, lack of exercise, and the strain 
and anxieties of poverty ? 

Such are the types of questions which constantly arise in con- 
nection with the occupational diseases, and it requires far more 
experience and judgment to solve them justly and accurately than 
it does to determine the nature and extent of the great majority of 
industrial accidents. Some industrial diseases and the effects of 
some industrial poisons, it is true, are as definite in their results as 
are accidents, but their number is limited in comparison with the 
vast number of cases of disease, often obscure, very slow in onset 
and chronic in course, which affect many large classes of workmen. 
The caisson disease, for example, is due to a single definite cause; 
its symptoms are immediate, uniform and easily recognizable for the 
most part, even by laymen. Similarly, when a man enters a brew- 
ery vat to shellac the interior with a preparation dissolved in wood 
alcohol, and dies from the fumes before he can be got out, the cause 
and effect are simple enough to establish. 

The misery and poverty entailed by the partial disability pro- 
duced by more insidious poisons or injurious surroundings are much 
more difficult to estimate with accuracy, even when one is well con- 
vinced of it ; that is, although the moral evidence is complete, the 
legal evidence is often very difficult to establish before a jury in a 
suit for damages, before an industrial insurance company or before 
a legislature when remedial laws are sought. This was well illus- 
trated in the prolonged effort required successfully to induce Con- 
gress to establish prohibitory taxation upon poisonous phosphorus 
matches, although evidence of poisoning in this instance was fully 
as definite as evidence usually is in machinery accidents. 



50 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

In some cases, moreover, injuries may themselves give rise to 
disease, as when the trauma of impact of foreign particles against 
the eye gives rise to corneal ulceration, chronic conjunctivitis and 
other ocular diseases. 

Despite these minor difficulties of classification, however, the 
subject of occupational diseases, in distinction from industrial acci- 
dents, is at length being recognized in this country as of at least 
equal, if not greater, importance to the community, not alone from 
the humanitarian but from the economic point of view as well ; and 
its study merits serious effort and exhaustive research. 

RELATION OF OCCUPATIONAL TO OTHER DISEASES 

This is a very important matter, for it not rarely happens that 
an occupational disease which is not necessarily fatal so strongly 
predisposes to some other disease by undermining the resisting 
power of the organism that the combination does prove fatal. This 
is particularly true of the diseases which, like those resulting from 
the metal poisons, may give rise to arteriosclerosis of advanced 
degree, and of the hard inorganic dusts which, by irritation of the 
respiratory processes, beget sclerosis of the lung and chronic bron- 
chitis, so that the victim becomes an easy prey to tuberculosis. 

The independent diseases most often associated with occupa- 
tional diseases are tuberculosis and pneumonia, and the former is 
so important that it will be discussed in a separate section. 

Anemias, too, are a frequently associated group of diseases, for 
they are not only produced by numerous toxic agents, especially of 
hemolytic type, but result from many conditions of environment 
apart from the actual work of the laborer, such as are discussed in 
the section on Harmful Environment. 

Eheumatism, chronic and subacute, is associated with many 
occupational diseases involving exposure to frequent changes of 
temperature and excessive moisture. 

Gout is another disease sometimes associated with occupational 
diseases, particularly with lead poisoning. English writers lay 
much stress upon this association, and gout is as liable to occur 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 51 

among the underfed and overworked as among the affluent. The 
combination of poor food and a poor quality of malt liquors is very 
liable to produce it. 

Diabetes, although not a disease of the nervous system, is made 
distinctly worse and is often apparently induced by occupations in- 
volving unusual nervous strain and mental worry. Asthma is asso- 
ciated with, as well as derived from, many of the dusty trades. 
Patients having any form of heart disease should avoid trades in 
which the circulation is liable to be overtaxed by exposure to ex- 
tremes of temperature, irregular hours, nervous strain or great 
physical fatigue. Those having a special tendency to catarrhal 
troubles, bronchitis or asthma should avoid all dusty trades, as 
should those having incipient tuberculosis or poor respiratory ca- 
pacity. They should seek outdoor rather than indoor occupations 
and avoid extremes of temperature, work which induces too much 
perspiration or exposure to wetting, which lower the resisting power 
against all such diseases. 

Those having chronic pulmonary or bronchial disease of any 
sort should keep out of all trades in which toxic gases, vapors or 
fumes are evolved. Those having chronic nephritis should avoid 
trades in which great humidity and extremes of temperature pre- 
dominate. !N\> one who has weak lungs, a weak heart, nephritis or 
arteriosclerosis, or who is very stout should ever undertake caisson 
work. 

Arteriosclerosis is one of the inevitable processes of advancing 
age, but ordinarily should not give rise to symptoms much before 
the seventh or eighth decade of life. It may, however, occur at 
any time after twenty-five or thirty years of age. Hence the apt 
saying that "a man is as old as his arteries." Arteriosclerosis and 
chronic nephritis appear to be upon the increase, for both may be 
caused by alcoholism, both are rapidly advanced by worry and 
mental as well as physical strain. The ordinary day laborer, enter- 
ing Bellevue Hospital, who has handled the pick or coal shovel, or 
lifted heavy weights as a longshoreman, who has solaced his leisure 
moments with poor whiskey, is, if he has passed his thirty-fifth year, 
morally certain to have thick-walled arteries. If he is a little older, 



52 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

he may have an aneurysm, or dilated artery; and, if older still, he 
may have a broken bloodvessel in the brain. 

There are two diseases often associated, namely, Bright's dis- 
ease of the kidneys and arteriosclerosis. Their frequent occurrence 
as a result of metal poisoning has been mentioned, but, in addition, 
they are produced by many forms of occupations aside from thqse of 
metal workers. Exposure to cold and wet among fishermen, the 
strain of heavy lifting among longshoremen, exposure to great heat 
among stokers and foundrymen are well recognized among the 
causes of these diseases. These types of laborers are very prone to 
the constant use of strong liquors, and chronic alcoholism is thus 
usually added to the exciting causes of such diseases. These dis- 
eases may not prove fatal for many years, but they impair general 
health and strength, and lessen the capacity for work. Moreover, 
any intercurrent serious infection like pneumonia is very liable to 
prove fatal; or, a few years later, the diseased arteries may give 
rise to apoplexy and the diseased kidneys to convulsions or fatal coma. 

The two diseases which are most important, from a numerical 
point of view, in association with the occupational diseases, are 
syphilis and chronic alcoholism. They both tend to render their 
victims far more liable to the influence of chronic metallic poisoning 
and the diseases of dusty trades. They both tend to produce sclerosis 
throughout the tissues of the body, but particularly in the arteries 
and kidneys. Hence a metal like lead, which has similar tendency, 
is greatly augmented in its effect by either of these independent dis- 
eases, and when all three conditions syphilis, chronic alcoholism 
and plumbism coexist the deterioration of the structures of the 
body may become extremely rapid and widespread. A large propor- 
tion of my cases of plumbism in hospital practice have been patients 
presenting this combination, and the arteriosclerosis reached a very 
advanced grade at a very early age. 

N/eurotic persons should avoid confining sedentary occupations 
and all occupations involving the breathing of vitiated air. I meet 
every year with a large number of patients engaged as "machine 
operators," i. e., workers in the clothing industry who sit for long 
hours in dusty, ill-ventilated rooms, who become highly neurasthenic 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 53 

and hypochondriacal. If their racial tendencies, as in the case of 
Hebrews, predispose to neuroses, this industry becomes particularly 
undesirable for them. 

A. TuBEECULOSIS 

The definite relationship of tuberculosis to occupational diseases 
is of the greatest importance, but the questions involved are often 
complex, and statistics, to be of scientific value, should be collected 
with great care and on a very large scale; for it is often not the 
occupation which is at fault, but the manner in which it is con- 
ducted. In general, however, there are three groups of cases: 

( 1 ) Those in which the nature of the work is such as obviously 
to be the direct cause of pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis or 
other diseases well known to favor the acquisition of tuberculosis, 
such as advanced anemia. In this group are those cases in which 
the exposure has been to mineral or metallic dusts, toxic gases, 
vapors and fumes, and any strong respiratory irritant. Also, where 
the exposure has been to sudden temperature changes, as in the case 
of bakers and stokers, or to constant cold and wet, 

(2) Those in which the occupation itself is quite innocuous, 
but in which the home conditions or those of poor food, poor housing 
and poor clothing, overcrowding, alcoholism, etc., reduce the general 
vitality so far as to render the workman an easy prey to tuberculosis. 

(3) Those in which there may be a combination of the factors 
of the two other groups, making it quite impossible always to deter- 
mine which is chiefly responsible. For example, of two steel-grind- 
ers with tuberculosis, one may have had obvious pulmonary fibrosis 
and chronic bronchitis and live in good home surroundings. It is 
fair to assume that his occupation predisposed to his disease. The 
other, working at his side, may have had no previous pulmonary or 
bronchial disease, but live at home in an inside dark bedroom, with 
possibly a tuberculous wife, or may be a victim of alcoholism. In 
this case it is manifestly unfair to attribute the tuberculosis to 
occupation alone, or, in fact, to attribute it to occupation at all. One 
frequently meets with statements that the mortality among bakers, 



54 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

potters, flax-spinners, et al., from tuberculosis is very high; but 
without statistics covering the questions of home environment, alco- 
holism, adequate food supply, etc., they may prove quite misleading, 
especially when introduced as a basis for legislation. In other 
words, the poor and ignorant are very subject to tuberculosis, no 
matter what their occupation, and in present days it is quite possible 
for the factory to be healthier than the home. 

The tuberculosis mortality as affecting workers in dusty trades 
has been studied upon an extensive scale, and is found to be about 
double the mortality from this cause among those having outdoor 
occupations such as farmers. 

According to statistics of the United States Bureau of Labor, 
published in 1908-9, among males from 25 to 34 years of age in all 
occupations, the mortality from tuberculosis constituted 31 per cent, 
of the total mortality, but, estimated by selected trades, the rates were 
as follows: 

Grinders 71 per cent. 

Tool makers 59 " " 

Printers 56 " " 

Stone cutters 53 " " 

Weavers 53 " " . 

Spinners , 50 " " 

Woollen mill workers 44 " " 

According to the Report of the New York State Bureau of 
Labor for 1906, "pulmonary tuberculosis was the leading disease in 
78 per cent, of the trades enumerated. The highest death rate 
(5.40 per 1,000) from this cause was credited to marble and stone cut- 
ters, who inhale large quantities of mineral dust. This was more than 
double the average rate in this class (2.62). Cigar makers and 
tobacco workers died at the rate of 4.76 in every 1,000 from the 
same disease. They inhale considerable vegetable dust, which con- 
tains nicotin and some ammonia. The death rate among com- 
positors, printers and pressmen from this disease was 4.35, while 
the rates of mortality of tinners and tinware makers (3.65), cabi- 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 55 

net makers and upholsterers (3.59), painters, glaziers and var- 
nishers (3.19), leather makers (3.11), coopers (2.99), plumbers 
and gas and steam fitters (2.94), brick and stone masons (2.93), 
and butchers (2.87) were far in advance of the average for this 
group of occupations. The trades that showed the least effect from 
the ravages of consumption were boot and shoe makers, machinists 
and millers, the death rates being, respectively, 1.35, 1.95 and 1.98 
in those callings." 

Five cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were reported by physicians 
in 1912 to the New York State Bureau of Labor as occupational in 
origin. "Three of these were grinders in a hammer factory, one a 
clay mixer in a porcelain factory, and one a foreman in a cement 
plant." 

Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman, statistician of the Prudential Life 
Insurance Company, at the Sixth International Congress on Tuber- 
culosis, presented the following statistical summary: 

"In the group of occupations exposing chiefly to inhalations of 
metallic dust the proportionate mortality from consumption was 
37.4 per cent. Animal and mixed fiber dusts, 32.3 per cent., and 
exposures to mineral dust, 28.6 per cent. 

"At the ages of 25 to 34 years the mortality was: 

Metallic dust 56.7% of deaths from all causes 

Vegetable fiber dust 53.3% of deaths from all causes 

Organic dust 50.1% of deaths from all causes 

Animal and mixed dust 49.7% of deaths from all causes 

"At the ages 35 to 44 years the mortality was: 

Metallic dust 43 % of deaths from all causes 

Animal and mixed fiber 40.4% of deaths from all causes 

Organic dust 36 % of deaths from all causes 

Vegetable dust 89.8% of deaths from all causes" 

He also gives the following detailed percentage of deaths from 
tuberculosis in dusty trades as compared with the deaths from all 



56 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

other causes in such trades (Sixth International Congress on Tuber- 
culosis, vol. iii, sec. v, p. 141) :

Glass cutters 34.5 

Furriers and taxidermists 32.4 

Silk mill workers 35.9 

Bakers 20.4 

Button makers 37.8 

Leather workers 32.0 

These figures include workmen between the fifteenth and sixty- 
fifth year. Selecting the decade between the twenty-fifth and thirty- 
fourth year inclusive, the rate of mortality is still higher, as follows : 

PER CENT. 

Grinders 70 

Engravers 61 

Compositors 66 

Stone workers 52 

Millers 87 

Bakers 42 

The United States Census states that about 472,000 males are 
exposed to fifteen of the most hurtful organic dusty trades, including 
the leather, button, tobacco and grain-milling industries. Among 
them the tuberculosis rate is 2.29 per 1,000 as compared with the 
rate of only 1.55 for all occupied males. An insurance rating of

the same group of industries states that they furnish twenty-three 
per cent, of all deaths from tuberculosis.

Although the mortality from tuberculosis among coal miners is, 
as generally stated, surprisingly low, it should be remembered that 
many of them die from or are incapacitated by accident at an age 
when they would be naturally most liable to that disease. More- 
over, many of the statistics are furnished by employers, not by 
qualified medical examiners; and, as Hoffman states, "It must 
also be considered that the mortality from respiratory diseases of all 
kinds is invariably high among coal miners." 

Dr. Arthur R. Perry has shown by an investigation of the cot- 
ton weavers of the New England States that the death rate from 
tuberculosis among the female operatives is more than twice as 
great as the average female death rate from this disease (LXI Con- 
gress, 1913, Senate Document, No. 645}. 



58 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

In New York City a hotbed of tuberculosis is found in the 
so-called "sweat shops," where so much ready-made clothing is 
manufactured. If a man comes to my Cornell Out-Patient Clinic 
and gives his occupation as a "tailor's presser," I always ask him 
at once how long he has had a cough. He is almost certain to have 
worked in a densely crowded unventilated room, dusty from the 
lint of clothing, and with his tailor's iron heated over a gas stove, 
which adds to the vitiation of the atmosphere. He has had long 
hours of work and poor food. Thus, anemic, ill-nourished and 
fatigued, his body is in an ideal condition for the development of the 
germs of tuberculosis, which one of his comrades is tolerably certain 
to pass on to him in the sweatshop. 

Another potent predisposing influence for tuberculosis is work- 
ing in cramped positions over machines, etc., over a bench, or like 
a shoemaker over his last, which prevent adequate lung expansion. 
As regards factory ventilation, it may be said, generally speaking, 
that the mortality rate from tuberculosis moves up and down with 
the window sash. 

Dr. E. R. Hayhurst, in the Bulletin of the Ohio State Board of 
Health, July, 1913, states: 

"Nearly every one of the 36,923 persons in occupations who died 
of consumption in the year 1909 [in the registration area of the U. S. 
census] ought to be living to-day. 

"Dust, dampness, darkness, devitalized air, food, fatigue, inac- 
tivity, unsafe temperatures, avoidable poisons and infections one or 
more of these factors paved the way for 'died of consumption.' 

"Not alone occupations but housing, habits and, greatest of all, 
ignorance of the correct conditions of living and working, summarize 
the causes." 

B. EPITHELIOMA AND CARCINOMA 

The influence of long-continued local irritation has long been 
recognized as a factor in determining the development of certain 
cases of carcinoma, and particularly epithelioma, and many cases 
have been recorded in which occupational irritants have favored the 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 59 

growth of malignant granuloma, or epithelioma in the lips, mouth, 
hands, scrotum, etc. For example, workers in tar, pitch, rosin and 
paraffin may exhibit such growths in the hands ; and epithelioma of 
the hands and scrotum was formerly described among chimney 
sweeps. 

Carpenters, in nailing shingles or the old-fashioned wooden 
laths, in order to work more rapidly, frequently hold the nails in the 
mouth. Formerly occasional cases of epithelioma of the tongue 
were reported among them which were attributed to this source of 
irritation. Diseases of this type, however, are rarely met with at 
the present time, owing to better understanding of their nature and 
improvement in methods of work. 

Carcinoma of the bladder develops sometimes as a result of 
irritating poisons which are eliminated through the kidneys, causing 
usually also hematuria. Cases have been reported from chronic 
anilin and benzin poisoning. 

RACE AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

The influence of race upon occupational disease is afforded a 
wider field for study in this country than in any other, owing to the 
enormous and varied foreign population derived from so many 
widely different sources. The subject cannot be entered into fully 
within the limits of this work, but a few general considerations may 
be noted. The selection of certain occupations by members of par- 
ticular races or nationalities is in great part an economic rather than 
a medical problem, and is in part, though by no means exclusively, 
due to existing conditions of occupation and education in the country 
from which the immigrant has come. To a certain extent, also, a 
sort of natural selection enters into the problem, the weaker races 
naturally avoiding the more arduous industries, and vice versa. 
Thus, miners, steel foundrymen, and smelters are largely recruited 
from Scandinavians and Poles. Caisson workers are principally 
Swedes and Irishmen, with a few stalwart negroes. The clothing 
industry is mainly followed by the Hebrews. Many Poles are 
workers in mills for fabrics and textiles. Some nationalities are 



60 GENEEAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

represented chiefly in outdoor occupations, for instance the Italians ; 
whereas the Hebrews in general seek sedentary or indoor trades re- 
quiring less arduous muscular effort. 

In the wards of Bellevue Hospital, where almost every national- 
ity and many races are represented, and where occupational diseases 
abound, I find a most interesting field for study of these relation- 
ships, and very noticeable is the influence of the alcoholic habit and 
of syphilis in connection with racial characteristics and as bearing 
upon the diseases of occupation. Thus, if lead poisoning causes an 
Irishman or an American to seek hospital treatment, he is apt, also, 
to be a hard drinker and have advanced arteriosclerosis. If he be 
an Italian painter, he is much less likely to present the added factor 
of chronic alcoholism. The Germans take kindly to many dust pro- 
ducing trades, such as metal working, and also to dyeing and tan- 
ning trades. There are, however, many exceptions to all this, and 
any conclusions must be very general. 

SEX AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Apart from the natural physiological differences between the 
sexes in muscular strength, nervous organization, temperament, etc., 
there has been observed marked difference in the effect of various 
poisons. Women, for example, are much more susceptible than men 
to lead poisoning. They are more liable to acute symptoms of 
plumbism, and most of the cases of lead encephalopathy occur 
among them. Similar differences exist in regard to phosphorus and 
mercury poisoning, arsenic and some other chemical substances. 
Women, too, are somewhat more susceptible than men to pulmonary 
occupational diseases, and especially to the subsequent development 
of tuberculosis, although the sexual differences with such exposure 
are less decided. Not a few of the occupational toxic hazards have 
been found so much greater for women that they are forbidden by 
law to be employed in them. In occupations involving nerve strain 
and long hours of work women are more apt to become neurasthenic. 

In the matter of clothing they are somewhat handicapped, espe- 
cially where they are exposed to irritant dusts or to constant wet, as 
in the case of laundresses. Their long hair is more difficult to keep 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 61 

clean and they suffer more than do men from cutaneous irritation 
of the scalp and hands. These, however, are comparatively minor 
matters, capable of regulation, to a great extent. Under adverse 
conditions of breathing foul or toxic air women are especially prone 
to anemia, digestive disorders, constipation, headache and neuralgias 
or neuritis. 

In general in the United States, as compared with foreign coun- 
tries, women are much less employed than men in lead works, pottery 
glazing and other especially hazardous trades, so that serious cases 
of lead and other metallic poisons are far less often met with among 
them. 

Among the many industries in which women and young girls 
are employed in great numbers, sometimes almost equally with men, 
are the shoemaking industry in factories, tanning works, cotton, jute, 
wool and other fabric mills, jewelry manufacture, dyeing, scouring 
and naphtha cleaning of clothing, match manufacture, paper making, 
felt hat making, pottery, glazing and scouring and the tobacco in- 
dustry. In steam laundries females compose about three-fourths of 
the force; in telephone offices, nearly 99 per cent., at least among 
day workers. Statistics compiled in Leipzig of deaths among fe- 
males employed in industrial occupations showed an estimated death 
rate per 100,000 females in all such occupations of 530 (for all 
ages), but in the selected chemical industries the rate was 850. 

A very important matter in connection with sex and occupation, 
and its relation to the welfare of the race, is the question of over- 
work of women during the period of parturition. It is estimated 
by the United States Bureau of the Census that fully 2,000,000 
married women and as many more unmarried are occupied in the 
various trades and productive industries. Pinard is quoted by 
Coughlin (N. Y. Med. Jour., June 10, 1911) as giving "the effect 
of employment upon the weight of a child by weighing 500 infants 
in each of the following classes : (a) 500 infants of women working 
right up to the time of labor, 3,000 grams; (b) 500 infants of 
women who spent the last few months in a lying-in hospital, 3,290 
grams, and (c) 500 infants of women who spent the whole of preg- 
nancy in a hospital, 3,368 grams." 



62 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

The special influence of plumbism in producing miscarriages and 
affecting the health of the young offspring of lead workers is con- 
sidered under Chronic Lead Poisoning. 

AGE AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Both extremes of life are quite unfitted for certain occupations. 
Growing and developing children need the best possible conditions 
of fresh air, regulation of rest and exercise, etc., as everyone knows, 
yet they are often placed in very dusty trades, such as pearl button 
making, carding, loom tending, etc., where the air is constantly 
filled with fibers. In tobacco factories they are quite susceptible to 
tobacco poisoning through dust inhalation. Children are often em- 
ployed in merely sorting and packing articles of manufacture in 
connection with which much dust is evolved, and such trades are 
particularly bad for them. 

Statistics of illness occurring in thirty-two industries, classified 
by age, gathered by the Austrian Government in the five-year period, 
1891-1895, showed marked preponderance in early life in the chemi- 
cal industries. The average cases of illness of all sorts in all thirty- 
two occupations for males from the fifteenth to the twentieth year 
of age numbered 42.3 for each 100 employees, but in the chemical 
industries (making and use of acids, pigments, chemicals, etc.) the 
cases of illness during five years numbered 1,002, or 137 per cent. 

In lead and brass manufactories jor anywhere that lead is a 
disease hazard children should never be permitted to work, or in 
occupations employing phosphorus or mercury, for they are far 
more susceptible to all the metallic poisons than adults. In the 
manufacture of artificial flowers, since the substitution of anilin 
and other pigments for arsenical colors, one seldom meets with 
arsenic poisoning among the young. 

Children are naturally less careful and less intelligent than 
adults about self-protection from occupational poisons. 

Children who work under bad conditions of lighting, or whose 
work necessitates constant observation of rapidly moving objects 
such as shuttles, often suffer from muscular and other forms of eye 
strain. 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 63 

It is estimated that 2,500,000 children from six years of age 
upward are employed in the United States in factories, mills and 
mines, a number which fully justifies the present universal activity 
in child labor legislation, but the study of the subject is usually 
made more in the line of general hygiene, questions of long working 
hours, absence from school, etc., than from the scientific investiga- 
tion of occupational in distinction from ordinary disease. 

As age advances much beyond the half-century mark the chief 
hazard is in regard to arteriosclerosis, which makes trades involving 
metal work and the strain of lifting heavy objects very undesirable. 
Coincident myocardial degeneration adds greatly to such disease 
hazard. Aged persons who are prone to asthma, emphysema and 
chronic bronchitis should, whenever possible, avoid all dusty trades. 



EXERCISE AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Many occupations are healthful by virtue of the reasonable exer- 
cise which they demand, others are the reverse because of the exces- 
sive muscular fatigue engendered, and others again are unhealthful 
largely because of their sedentary character and entire lack of mus- 
cular exercise. In general, excepting the existence of serious specific 
poisoning, trades requiring fairly vigorous exercise are more health- 
ful than those which demand a minimum of physical exertion. This 
striking fact is stated by W. C. Garrison : "The ratio of tuberculosis 
as compared with other diseases among wage-workers is greatest 
where the amount of exertion is least, and lowest where it is greatest, 
the intermediate degrees showing an intermediate ratio. Work re- 
quiring unusual physical strength, such as is performed by stone 
cutters, masons and steel construction men, is not prejudicial to 
health and longevity by reason of any circumstance peculiarly relat- 
ing to them. Indeed, being performed in the open air, these and 
other outdoor occupations are practically free from the incidental 
circumstances which lead to pulmonary troubles, and their mortality 
ratio is much smaller than that of the comparatively unlaborious 
trades carried on indoors." This, however, is something of an over- 



64 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

statement, and much depends upon the quantity and quality of the 
mineral dust. 



IRREGULARITY OF EMPLOYMENT. "SPEEDING UP" 

Many trades, owing to different seasons of the year at which they 
are followed, or fluctuations in the market, economic or otherwise, 
demand employment for special periods under strain of great activ- 
ity, followed by periods of idleness. Thus, the workman for a por- 
tion of the year may have intense labor, with good wages and abun- 
dant food, followed by poverty and insufficient food from lack of 
employment. Such trades, for example, which may be shut down 
in winter are brick-making, fruit and vegetable canning, outdoor 
mason work and painting, etc. More or less serious effect upon the 
general health of the workman is the natural outcome of such indus- 
tries. In periods of idleness, too, there is often greater resort to 
alcoholic stimulation. 

"Speeding up," as the process of hurry to fulfill requirements of 
contracts, especially in the textile and clothing industries, is called, 
subjects the operatives, who are often women, to most unhealthful 
nervous tension and general physical fatigue, resulting, as it often 
does, in neurasthenia. The modern machine sets the pace for labor, 
and the workman must keep up with it or abandon his occupation. 
As the factory has largely supplanted the small shop, and machines 
have supplanted individual tools in many industries, too often work- 
men are crowded together under conditions of noise, dust, foul air 
and general confusion. They no longer can individualize their 
work and lack the mental pleasure of completing a varied piece of 
manual work. Under these conditions, when a faster rate of work 
is demanded, they feel the strain sooner and sometimes resort to 
stimulants to brace them for the emergency. 

EFFICIENCY AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Mr. Taylor's researches in efficiency showed that a man em- 
ployed constantly in lifting heavy weights, such as pig-iron, should 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 65 

only be under load 43 per cent, of the working day and must be 
entirely free from load for 57 per cent, to attain the maximum 
efficiency. 

In the study of the relationship of efficiency, i. e., of mechanical 
output of energy in any industry, in relation to factors of health, it- 
should be borne in mind that some industries are hazardous by 
virtue of some one seriously poisonous substance, whereas others are 
so from the combined result of a number of mildly deleterious con- 
ditions. In so far as muscular work is a mechanical problem, its 
extent is directly dependent upon the good health of the operative, 
which implies not alone good muscular contractility, but normal co- 
ordination and activity of brain and nerves in directing and con- 
trolling muscular activity. The workman employed in bad ventila- 
tion, with resulting poor oxidation of his tissues, in bad light, with its 
depressing mental effect and the increased effort expended to counter- 
act it, or who is surrounded by conditions of dirt, excessive humidity 
and exhausting temperature, loses in efficiency of output to a degree 
which is often one-third or perhaps one-half of the normal standard. 

Dr. Elliott Washburn cites an instance where twenty-eight em- 
ery grinders in Massachusetts, working in a badly lighted, ill-venti- 
lated basement, increased their efficiency nearly thirty-three per cent, 
on being transferred to a hygienically lighted and ventilated work- 
room. 

In Illinois were two white lead establishments. One, which 
made no attempt to save the health and lives of its eighty workmen, 
was compelled to replace almost its entire working force every two 
and a half months. The other, employing double the number of 
workmen and supervising their safety, changed less than 100 work- 
men a year. The time lost in instructing new laborers constantly 
is no inconsiderable factor in efficiency (Dr. Alice Hamilton). Writ- 
ing further of this topic, Dr. Hamilton states (Amer. Assoc. for 
Labor Legislation Publications, No. 10, 1910) : "I do not know 
whether it is an advantage or not to have a large body of men 
moving in and out of the smelting works, lead pipe works and white 
lead factories, staying for a month to a year and dropping out as 
soon as they are leaded. It is true that the individual worker does 



66 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

not suffer as serious damage as in the old countries, where work is 
not so abundant and a man must stick to his job, even if it makes 
him ill, but, on the other hand, there is a much larger number of 
men exposed to lead poisoning. One smelting works, with a pay- 
roll of 600, reports that at each pay day, that is every two weeks, 
they lose from five per cent, to fifty per cent, of their men, and 
must send beforehand to the big cities for gangs of new men. An- 
other smelting plant loses twenty-five to thirty per cent, of the men 
each month." 

Dr. Hamilton found another lead manufactory in Illinois in 
which 300 men had to be engaged yearly to maintain a working 
force of 50, and in another, with 450 to 600 employees, twenty to 
forty per cent, dropped out every pay day because of plumbism. 
The policy of regarding such economic losses as inevitable is incon- 
ceivably stupid.* On the other hand, Dr. Krautz states (Sozial 
Technik IV, No. 2, 1912) that whereas in a German zinc smelting 
works employing 1,200 there were in five years, from 1879 to 1885, 
no less than 819 cases of serious lead poisoning, in 1910, under 
modern hygienic regulations, in the whole of the Upper Schlesingen 
district, employing 6,400 workmen in zinc production, there were 
only 78 cases of plumbism. 

In a storage battery plant in New York City, investigated by 
Dr. John B. Andrews, the men working under the worst conditions 
of hygiene usually developed lead symptoms within a month. He 
estimated the. loss in wages and expense of medical treatment at 
about $65 per man for each attack. After the building was re- 
placed by a modern hygienic one the trouble virtually disappeared. 

In one of the Californian gold mines, where uncinariasis affects 
fully half the workmen so that they cannot do the work of healthy 
men, Dr. Herbert Gunn estimates the net loss to the owners at over 
$20,000 a year. A few doses of thymol for the men and proper 
hygiene in the mine might save this entire waste ! 

In discussing the matter of efficiency as effected by the workman's 
health, there are two peculiarities which differentiate very strik- 
ingly the labor of this country from most foreign countries, and 
which are not without considerable influence upon industrial dis- 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 67 

eases. First, owing to the large immigration of able-bodied work- 
men, in many localities it is easy to replace those who are invalided, 
whereas in many foreign countries the working population, being 
much less migratory than in this country, remains to toil and grow 
old often in one locality. This applies chiefly to unskilled labor, 
but it is precisely with this type of workman that many of the 
greatest risks are run in smelting works, the handling of crude 
chemical products in bulk, etc. Moreover, being unskilled, he is 
also ignorant both of the risks he runs and of fundamental laws of 
hygienel He is often unable to read warning notices, or at least to 
read them in an unfamiliar language. He is left to himself as 
far as any instructions are concerned, and when, for example, he 
promptly acquires lead, arsenic, mercury, nitroglycerin or carbon 
monoxid poisoning he is dropped from the pay-roll and turned off 
to seek another job, which he usually first finds Consists in lying 
for some weeks or months on a hospital cot. It is difficult to see 
that this state of things makes for economic efficiency, and it cer- 
tainly, from a humanitarian point of view, is a disgrace. 

The second difference above referred to is that the average 
American workingman is of younger years than the foreigner, 
again because of immigration conditions. 

In any statistical study of workingmen and efficiency it should 
always be borne in mind that some types of work naturally attract 
the robust and vigorous, whereas other types attract the weak. A 
tanner, for example, or a steel rolling mill worker, is naturally a 
robust man or he could not enter the industry ; but a clicker, pegger 
or cutter in a shoe factory may be a mere stripling or physically 
weak from any cause. Hence comparative industrial statistics 
should always be taken cum grano salts when applied to arguments 
as to disease and mortality. 

NIGHT WORK 

Much has been written regarding the alleged relative harmful- 
ness of night as compared with day work. Much night work is abso- 
lutely essential, especially in foundries, where the fires must be kept 



68 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 

up. Among engineers, stokers and many types of transportation 
workmen night work is necessary. It is claimed that the workshops, 
poorly lighted with artificial light, are depressing to the nervous 
system and mind, and that it is more difficult to obtain adequate 
sleep in the daytime. I confess I have not been impressed by these 
claims. Practically, the work of coal and other miners is the 
same, day or night, as is that of a stoker in the hold of a steamship ; 
and in many industrial establishments artificial light is depended 
upon both by day and night. It is, of course, a disadvantage from 
the standpoint of home life to have to sleep while others are active, 
and vice versa; but there is little in night work per se that is injuri- 
ous, and my experience is that night workers are quite as healthy as 
day workers in the same occupation. It is further claimed that for 
women and young girls night work is -morally deleterious, but this 
is a matter which also has been much exaggerated. It is not work 
that leads the young astray, but idleness and opportunity, which 
may be quite as available, or more so, in the home than in the fac- 
tory or mill. As a matter of fact, with very many night workers the 
condition is regarded as temporary and the work is frequently 
changed. 

COMPULSORY REPORTING OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Following the practice in vogue in England for more than a 
decade, the system of requiring physicians to make official reports 
of cases of certain of the occupational diseases has been instituted 
quite recently in the United States. In 1911 six States passed laws 
covering this matter which are substantially the same. These six 
States were California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, New York 
and Wisconsin. Five more States, including New Jersey and Mary- 
land, have been added to this list. The reportable diseases concern 
four metals lead, arsenic, mercury and phosphorus, or their com- 
pounds one germ disease, anthrax, and one environmental disease, 
compressed air illness. All the States require the same list, with 
the exception of Wisconsin, which omits anthrax and adds brass 
and zinc smelting, and New York, which added, in 1913, wood alco- 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 69 

hoi poisoning and brassfounder's ague to the original six dis- 
eases. In Connecticut and New York the reports are to be 
sent to the Commissioner of Labor, and in several other States to 
the State Board of Health. The object of the reporting is to enable 
the State authorities to collect data and locate the foci of occupa- 
tional diseases, so that State inspectors may visit them and make 
detailed reports upon the conditions prevailing among the workmen. 
From such study it is hoped that sufficiently accurate data may be 
gathered upon which remedial legislation may be based, when found 
desirable. Moreover, it is expected that the reporting itself may 
prove educational by directing the attention of physicians and others 
to the extent to which occupational diseases have developed in this 
country. The list is a meager one, but it is intended to add to it 
from time to time as further study of the subject may warrant. It 
was copied from the British law, and in some respects is ill-adapted 
for this country. For example, anthrax is so rare a disease in the 
United States that legislation regarding it appears superfluous, and 
in States like Connecticut there is little or no caisson work or under- 
water tunneling from which compressed air illness might be derived. 
On the other hand, there are many other incapacitating diseases of 
far greater frequency and importance. It is well, however, that a 
beginning has been made toward statistical accuracy, and in time 
defects in the law may be amended. In each State, excepting Con- 
necticut, there is a penalty, varying from ten dollars to one hundred 
dollars, for failure to report, and in Connecticut and California 
small fees are given to physicians who make reports. As proof of 
the value of the reporting system may be cited the experience with 
lead poisoning in England. In 1900 more than 1,000 cases of 
plumbism were reported, but, owing to remedial legislation which 
ensued, in 1910 the reported cases were only 553, or nearly one-half 
the original number. 

Reporting of occupational diseases should not be regarded 
merely as preliminary to legislation, for in many instances educa- 
tional influences may be brought to bear by the State authorities 
which may be more beneficial in the end. The various health 
boards now require the reporting of many contagious or infectious 



70 



REPOKTING OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



diseases against which no legislative action is found necessary. 
Nevertheless, such data are of great scientific value, and in this 
light primarily the reporting of the occupational diseases should be 
regarded. 

In New York State the registration blank for occupational dis- 
eases has been made to conform in size and general character with 
the national death certificate blank recommended by the Bureau of 
the Census. 

Following is this certificate blank for notification issued in 1912 
by the New York State Department of Labor. It was devised by 
Mr. L. W. Hatch, Chief Statistician of the Bureau of Labor Statis- 
tics, in conference with the Committee on Occupational Diseases 
above referred to (page 7). This certificate is reproduced in full, 
as a sample, for it is more complete than are some others of the

State certificates and might well be adopted for the sake of uniform- 
ity as a general model. It has been copied, practically verbatim, by 
the Ohio State Board of Health. 

I submitted the following summary to be printed on the back 
of the above certificate for the information of physicians not familiar 
with the full scope of the occupational diseases; but it was decided 
to issue it not on the certificate, but, with additional data, as a pocket 
booklet -to be distributed with the blank certificates, which is de- 
scribed in the Appendix. 



SPECIAL OCCUPATION HAZARDS AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES 



Such are derived from I. Metals. II. Dusts. III. Gases, Vapors and 
Fumes. IV. Injuries to Nerves and Muscles. V. Injuries to the 
Eyes. VI. Injuries to the Skin. VII. Compressed Air. 



I. METAL POISONING is derived from filings, dusts and fumes of metals 
or their salts, which enter the system through inhalation or swallowing, being 
conveyed to the mouth often by unclean hands or food eaten in dusty workshops. 

Poisonous or irritating metals include: antimony: arsenic: brass: 
copper: iron or steel: lead: manganese: mercury: phosphorus: silver: tin: zinc: 
bronze powders: lead or solder: or compounds of any of these substances. 
Special attention should be given to reporting diseases of the bones due to 
mercury, chromic acid, etc. 

II. DUSTS cause irritation of all the respiratory passages and of the eyes 
and skin. In some instances the metal dusts enter the mouth as well as the 
lungs and are swallowed and absorbed. Irritating dusts are of three classes: 

(a) Insoluble Inorganic Dusts (irritating the respiratory passages) : flint : 
silica: sand (e. g., sand blasts, sand paper) : carbon (e. g., coal, soot) : brick dust: 
marble: granite: terra cotta: cement: asphalt: enamel: glass: quartz: lime 
(e. g-, gypsum, plaster): meerschaum: phosphates (e. g., fertilizers) : guano: 
emery: diamond dust: metal filings (e. g., lead, brass, iron and steel, etc.): 
pumice: ashes. 

(b) Soluble Inorganic Dusts (liable to be swallowed and absorbed): 
soluble arsenic, mercury, lead and silver compounds: metal filings of lead, brass 
and zinc. 

(c) Organic Dusts and fibers arising from handling or manufacture of 
wood, bone and shell: from fur, skins, hides, and leather: feathers: brooms and 
straw: flour and grain: jute: flax (linen): hemp: cotton: wool (worsted, etc.): 
tobacco: felt: carpets: rags and paper: horsehair: street sweepings. 

III. GASES, VAPORS and FUMES irritate the respiratory passages 



72 REPORTING OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

and eyes and may cause poison by absorption. The most important are: 
illuminating gas (oil gas): gases from coke and coal: coal gas: carbon dioxid 
(brewers' vats, bakers' ovens, aerated waters), chromic acid: mineral acids, 
sulphuric, hydrochloric, nitric, etc. (acid factory workers, engravers, etchers and 
lithographers): mercury cyanid: heated lead: ammonia: ammonium carbonate, 
ammonium chlorid: tar and creosote (distillers): asphalt and petroleum 
products, (naphtha, benzene, gasolene used in dry cleaning and otherwise), 
wood alcohol: smoke (firemen, varnish makers, varnishers): arseniuretted 
hydrogen (copper refiners): ferrosilicon: amyl alcohol: dinitrobenzol: nitro- 
glycerin: cordite: carbon disulphid: chlorin: chlorid of lime: 'carbonyl 
chlorid: phosgene (dyeing industry): formaldehyd: hydrofluoric acid: 
hydrocyanic acid: ammonium, sodium and potassium cyanids: pyridin: 
sulphur and sulphuretted hydrogen : anilin : dinitrobenzene and dinitrotoluene 
vapors. 

IV. INJURIES TO NERVES AND MUSCLES are derived from occupa- 
tional strain, fatigue, repeated blows and vibrations, excessive pressure, repeated 
muscular contractions, faulty positions, as in standing, sitting, leaning over 
benches, etc. The so-called "Occupation Neuroses" are comprised under this 
class of injury and disease. The principal effects of rerve or muscle strain are 
observed as: palsy, cramps (writer's, telegrapher's, typewriter's), sciatica, neu- 
ritis, neuralgia, tremors, vasomotor disorders, gastric and intestinal disorders, 
general "nervousness" and insomnia: deformities of chest from cramped posi- 
tions (as in tailors) : curvature of spine, flat foot, etc. 

V. INJURIES TO THE EYES : Excessive light causes eye strain to electric 
light men, X-ray workers, steel foundrymen, etc., and excessive heat subjects 
puddlers, glass workers and others to optic neuritis, conjunctivitis, etc. Dusts of 
various kinds irritate the eyelids or injure the eyeball. 

VI. INJURIES TO THE SKIN are caused by acids, corrosive alkalies, 
lime, irritating dusts, tar, creosote and petroleum products, especially paraffin, 
dyes, etc. They give rise to eczema, fissures, ulcers, boils, epithelioma, etc. 

VII. COMPRESSED AIR affects caisson men and divers. The fonner 
are subject to cramps, paralysis, serious lesions of the spinal cord, etc., some- 
times proving fatal. 

Statement of Occupation. Precise statement of occupation is very 
important so that the relative healthfulness of various pursuits may be known. 
It is necessary to know (a) the trade, profession or particular kind of work, as 
printer, or brass worker, and also (b) employment in detail in such trade, etc., 
as type-setter, linotype operator, or polisher, buffer. It is important to dis- 
tinguish, where possible, between present and previous occupation as the cause 
of present illness. Disease contracted in an occupation is itself among the causes 
leading to frequent change of occupation among industrial workers. 

Owing to the meager literature of the occupational diseases as 
observed in the United States, and the fact that in most medical 
colleges the subject is either entirely omitted or dealt with in a 



GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY 73 

most cursory manner, physicians who have not given special thought 
to the matter, or whose experience with this important group of 
diseases is very limited, are not likely to be conversant with the 
number and extent of the industrial disease hazards. This is clearly 
shown by the lack of provision for their classification in ordinary 
hospital and dispensary reports. To aid in correcting this deficiency 
I suggested to the State Bureau of Labor that a booklet be issued 
and sent to physicians, together with the above described notification 
blanks. The suggestion was adopted, and the text which I supplied 
comprises a working basis of classification of all the common disease 
hazards of occupation as met with in this country. Among other 
items it contains a "Tabulated List of Certain Harmful Substances 
and Their Effects," in which are arranged in parallel columns (a) 
The Harmful Substance; (b) The Industry Where Prepared or 
Used; (c) Mode of Entrance into the Body; (d) Diseases or Symp- 
toms. Copies of this booklet may be obtained upon application to 
the Chief Statistician of the New York State Labor Bureau at 
Albany. A somewhat more elaborate classification is comprised in 
the Appendix to this volume. 

Following are some of the data required in the notification blank 
of another State :

pulsory reporting law: 



DISEASES OF OCCUPATIONS 

in Factories and Workshops 

The total number of cases of poisoning and of anthrax reported to the Home 
Office under the Factory and Workshop Act during December, 1911, was 77, 
consisting of 63 cases of lead poisoning, 2 of arsenic poisoning, and 12 of anthrax; 
4 deaths due to lead poisoning and 2 to anthrax were also reported. In addition, 
21 cases of lead poisoning (7 of which were fatal) were reported among house 
painters and plumbers. 

During the twelve months ended December, 1911, the total number of 
cases of poisoning and of anthrax was 755, as compared with 574 in 1910. The 
number of deaths was 49 in 1911, as compared with 48 in 1910. In addition, 
there were 263 cases of lead poisoning (including 48 deaths) among house painters 
and plumbers during 1911, as compared with 232 cases (including 35 deaths) 
during 1910. 

REPORTING BY FACTORY INSPECTORS 

The Illinois State Department of Factory Inspection provides 
blank forms for inspection reports which call for the following data, 
among others, and may serve as an excellent model. 

Besides the usual name, age, sex, detailed occupation and social 
status data, a description of the local sanitary conditions is called 
for, such as the use of dressing rooms, overalls, respirators, washing 
facilities, hot and cold water, individual clean towels, waterclosets, 
separate lockers for street and factory clothing, disinfectants, soap 
or other cleansing materials, nail brushes and shower baths ; details

of sweeping during working hours, cleaning of benches and work 
tables, dampening of dust and of materials used; separate lunch 
rooms; time allotted for meals and for cleaning hands before 
meals ; prohibition of taking food and drink into workroom ; 
proper drinking water supply and sanitary faucets ; fumes, 
ore, slag, dross, etc., kept in separate rooms dampened when 
possible; separate rooms for mixing, sorting, weighing, pack-

or finishing; cleaning of fixtures, machinery and tools; hoods and 
covers over hoppers, boiling kettles and vats, etc., connected with 
exhaust ducts; accumulation of refuse; posting of notices for em- 
ployees as to hazards ; other preventive instruction, verbal or writ- 
ten, the latter in various languages where foreigners are employed.

I. PROPHYLAXIS 

OUTLINE OF GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

In a paper read before the Albany County Medical Society and 
Hygiene Exhibit, Albany, October 18, 1912, I have summarized the 
work of prophylaxis of the occupational diseases as follows : 

(1) What the State may do. The work of the State should be 
(a) educational, through the collection and dissemination of data; 
and (b) preventive, through prohibitive and protective legislation. 

(2) What special organizations may do. 

(3) What the employer may do to protect the workman. 

(4) What the workman may do to protect himself. 

(5) What the physician may do in scientific investigation and 
the collection of accurate data. 

(6) What the general public may do through cooperation of 
the many interests involved and endowment of museums and clinics 
for the study of the occupational diseases. 

(7) What the public press may do in popularizing accurate 
information as to industrial disease hazards. 

(These several topics are considered in detail in the following 
pages.) 

Among the general remedial measures for the lessening of the 
occupational diseases are: 

(1) Congressional investigation by commission, to be followed 
by such legislation as the anti-poisonous match law of 1911, etc. ; 

(2) Investigations of special industries by the National De- 
partment of Commerce and Labor ; 

76 



PKOPHYLAXIS 77 



(3) State investigation by commission, factory inspection, 
labor bureau and health board departments, with appropriate legis- 
lation and especially published documentary evidence, information 
and instruction; 

(4) Employer's liability and compensation acts for diseases as 
well as accidents due directly to industrial hazards; 

(5) Independent investigations and a campaign of education 
among physicians, employers and employees, conducted by the 
national and state associations for labor legislation, economic asso- 
ciations, the National Association of Manufacturing Chemists, and 
similar organizations; 

(6) Collection of accurate systematized records based upon a 
uniform nomenclature by the National Bureau of the Census, and 
by general hospitals arid dispensaries; 

(7) Collective investigations by medical societies; 

(8) Establishment of industrial museums, occupational dis- 
ease clinics and hospital services; 

(9) Additions to the literature by publication of reports of 
cases and descriptions of occupational disease hazards; 

(10) Periodic examination by trained physicians of employees 
in dangerous industries. 

EDUCATIONAL MEASURES 

The Employer. In seeking statistics from employers of men in 
hazardous trades there are usually three groups of answers: (a) 
from those willing and sometimes eager to cooperate in the better- 
ment of their working conditions, either from economic or humani- 
tarian reasons or both, and who only lack the requisite knowledge of 
such means of betterment ; (b) from those who have already adopted 
all practical means of avoiding disease hazards for their workmen; 
(c) from those who assert, through indifference or ignorance, that 
such alleged evils as industrial diseases do not exist, at least in so 
far as their own establishments are concerned, or that, if they do, 
they are solely due to the workman's own negligence. As W. C. 
Garrison says in writing of this topic, "The workman's trials are, 



78 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



for the most part, viewed through the office window, and often the 
purpose of such closer scrutiny as he may receive is to note, not how 
his health is being affected by work, but rather how nearly the 
product of his labor is in proportion to the wages paid. Of his 
illness or death there is often 'no record' save that which is inci- 
dental to a deduction of wages for lost time in one case and in the 
other the substitution of a new name for his own on the pay-roll." 

In many industries where unskilled labor is employed it is far 
simpler for the manufacturer to discharge the workman who is 
incapacitated temporarily by illness resulting from the industry, and 
replace him, than to take the trouble and incur the expense of install- 
ing proper sanitary equipment and regulations. 

Such evil conditions can be met to a limited extent by legisla- 
tion, but legislation regarding protective hygiene necessitates con- 
stant inspection to insure its enforcement, which involves great ex- 
pense to the state. The same or better results may frequently be 
brought about by instruction. To make, this effective, reliable data 
should be collected and printed by the various state labor bureaus 
or factory commissioners, concisely summarized for each separate 
hazard. The employer, when presented with such data, may be 
convinced of the extent and seriousness of the disease hazards as 
they concern his own industry ; and, if practical and reasonable sug- 
gestions for betterment are simultaneously issued, he is almost certain 
to be convinced, at least, of the economic value of the suggestions, 
and may put them into effect for greater efficiency if not for humani- 
tarian reasons. The gathering and interpretation of such data is 
expert work which the employer has not always the means or knowl- 
edge to undertake, and the results should be summarized and printed 
for him in convenient and striking form. 

Some of the large manufacturing corporations of this country 
have already gone so far in hygienic progress as to employ trained 
nurses to visit the homes of their women employees, who take charge 
of cases of temporary illness and look after the hygiene of the em- 
ployee's children, particularly as to the care of their teeth and tonsils, 
etc., so that the mothers will be less frequently disturbed by illness 
in their homes. 



PROPHYLAXIS 79 

The Workman. One difficulty in educating workmen in the 
avoidance of industrial diseases is found in the shifting character 
of unskilled labor. Many of the occupational diseases, like chronic 
lead poisoning, for example, arise most insidiously, and when the 
workman begins to ail he merely quits his "job" instead of seeking 
to remedy insalubrious conditions. This fact materially adds to the 
difficulty of obtaining accurate statistical information regarding the 
disease hazards of many occupations. 

Workmen in general are more ready to enter upon trades in 
which the hazard is of the nature of accident or injury in distinction 
from disease. To the workman's mind, an injury is a definite thing 
which he feels he can understand and avoid, but a trade having a 
bad name for begetting disease is vague and mysterious, and, if he 
enters upon it, it is more apt to be under stress of circumstance, 
with the intention of quitting as soon as he can find better em- 
ployment. 

When attempts are made to secure data from him, moreover, a 
to his own or fellow workmen's ailments, he frequently denies that 
such exist, for fear of making it appear to his employer that he is 
not able to meet standards of efficiency in his work or for fear of 
dismissal. 

Some years ago workmen from a large brass foundry adjacent 
to one of my clinics came in frequently for treatment for "brass 
founder's ague." As soon as one of my assistants, however, began 
to show special interest in the details of their work and environment, 
and the condition of their fellow workers, they ceased to visit the 
dispensary and none have come since. Similar experiences are 
very common. 

In order to interest workmen in care of the general health as 
a means of self-protection against occupational hazards, I have 
adopted the plan of distributing to them printed circulars of infor- 
mation and precautions. A sample circular follows, devised by my 
chief of clinic, Dr. W. H. Sheldon, and we have found them much 
appreciated by the workmen, who take them home and often discuss 
them with their friends, whereas they are very liable to forget or fail 
to comprehend mere verbal directions given them at the time of ex- 



80 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

animation* Many minds, too, are much more impressed by anything 
which is seen in print.

RULES FOR GENERAL CARE OF HEALTH 

1. Remember that rooms that have no sunshine are not healthy. 

2. Sleep with your windows open and spend as much time as possible in 
the open ah*. 

3. Take a tepid sponge bath every day, and at least two warm baths a 
week. Brush the teeth every morning and evening. 

4. Unless you have out-door work, walk at least two miles every day. 
Practice breathing exercises and take fifteen minutes exercise daily with light 
dumb-bells, or a cane. 

5. Habits: 

Sleep eight hours every night. 

Be sure to have one good movement of bowels every morning. 

Do not drink more than one cup of tea or coffee a day. 

Use tobacco in moderate quantities only. 

Drink no liquor of any kind. It destroys digestion, rums the kidneys 
and leads to dropsy and other serious diseases. 

6. Meals: 

Eat moderate quantities. Chew your food well. Rest for half an 
hour after each meal. 

7. Diet: 

Dairy products. Milk, cream, butter and cheese. 

Cereals. Oatmeal, hominy, rice, Indian meal, etc. 

Eggs. In any form except fried. 

Fish. Any fresh fish, boiled, baked, or broiled. 

Meat. All the red and white meats, boiled, broiled or roasted. 

Vegetables. Potatoes, beans, peas, carrots, beets, turnips, squash, 
lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, onions. 

Fruits. All fresh fruits except bananas. 



PROPHYLAXIS 81 

Avoid. All fried foods, fresh breads, canned or salted meats. Do not 
eat pickles, pastries or candies. 

Remember. That all alcoholic liquors, including beer, are poisonous. 
Do not take alcoholic drinks. 

Another sample is given under the heading, Prophylaxis of 
Lead Poisoning. 

Similar circulars might be distributed on a large scale through 
the agency of trades unions, the circulars being supplied by the 
state labor bureau or any philanthropic agency. 

Another means of educating the workman in special dangers of 
occupation is by placards posted conspicuously in the workrooms 
where the danger exists. Such placards of warning have proved 
valuable in the prevention of accidents, as so well demonstrated by 
the Illinois Steel Company. The objection to their use is that they 
are either overlooked or read more superficially than the circular 
which the workman takes home with him and regards as a personal 
message. 

Some employers are willing to grant time to their workmen to 
attend brief talks on special hazards given in the mill or workshop 
by a physician or qualified sanitarian. In Kew York City lectures 
on industrial diseases are shortly to be given to workmen in the 
public schools in the evening. The best method, however, of en- 
lightening the workingman is through increasing the number of 
physicians appointed to examine workingmen periodically to detect 
early symptoms of industrial diseases and give direct personal in- 
struction as to avoiding danger. Wherever this has been practiced, 
as it has been notably in the lead industry in England, it has resulted 
in enormous reduction of morbidity. 

In summary, the workman should be educated through the means 
of printed circulars, posted warnings, free illustrated lectures, and 
personally by visiting physicians wherever feasible. 

The Physician. Dr. J. T. Arlidge, of London, has said, "It is as 
essential to the medical man to acquaint himself with the occupation 
of a patient as an important health factor as with the hygiene of his 
home and neighborhood or with his family history. And it is 



82 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

important for him to arrive at a correct estimate of the part played 
by employment in producing the symptoms he detects or in causing 
the mortality he deplores." 

It is time that instruction in the occupational diseases should 
form part of every medical college curriculum, so that interest in 
this most important branch of medical science may be stimulated at 
an early period. Further, educational work may well be conducted by 
the state, which has the means for collection of statistics and for 
summarizing them in impressive form. Compulsory notification of 
the occupational diseases (described in the section on this topic on 
page 68) is the chief means for this purpose, and the notification 
blanks should be accompanied by circulars or booklets of informa- 
tion on the disease hazards in general, to be sent to those working in 
municipal hospitals and dispensaries where cases of industrial dis- 
ease are met with most often. Such institutions, moreover, should 
see to it that their records of occupational cases are properly classi- 
fied and tabulated a matter which is surprisingly neglected in 
many institutions of high standing. 

The rapidly increasing number of monographs published and of 
medical society discussions upon the occupational diseases evidences 
the rapid development of a new interest in this matter, and medical 
societies can accomplish much good by promoting intensive study 
of all the more important industrial diseases and publishing their 
scientific reports. 

The Public. The direct interest of the public in the problems 
of occupational diseases is humanitarian, economic, sociological and 
legislative, and much is being done for enlightenment through such 
agencies as social service workers, associations for the study of 
economics, and labor legislation, through factory inspection com- 
missions and many other forms of special investigation. The prob- 
lem is as great as that of tuberculosis, and, judging from what has 
been accomplished in this field in the past decade, there is every 
reason to hope that equally striking results may soon follow for the 
mitigation of the occupational diseases. The "traveling exhibits," 
described on page 6, of the industrial hazards and the establish- 
ment of the so-called museums of safety, where many of these 



PROPHYLAXIS 83 

hazards may be illustrated, will do much to promote further public 
interest in the problems involved. 

The Public Press. Generally speaking, the attitude of the 
press toward the problems under discussion is improving. Much 
important information was published in connection with the recent 
International Hygienic Congress and its admirable exhibition, and 
the manner in which the campaign against phosphorus poisoning was 
supported by the press was of great service in suppressing that evil. 

One of the most influential of the New York daily papers has 
begun a collection of printed reports upon occupational diseases to be 
kept on file for reference when special occupational poisons may 
demand public attention in its editorial columns, so that correct 
points of view may be presented. 

WORKINGMEN'S INSURANCE AGAINST OCCUPATIONAL 

DISEASE 

It is beyond the scope of this work to enter upon a discussion of 
economic problems, but no discussion of prophylaxis of the occu- 
pational diseases can be complete without, at least, a brief reference 
to the progress which is being made, through legislation, in helping 
the workman to secure prompt and scientific treatment for many of 
the diseases which may be acquired as the direct result of occupation. 
In German legislation, instituted in 1883 and fully developed since 
that date, is found the best exposition of this system. The German 
laws compel the industrial workman whose annual wage is less than 
2,000 marks ($480) to insure himself in an insurance fund for 
which he pays not more than six per cent, of his earnings. This 
premium, whatever it may be, is doubled by further payment by the 
employer. The insured acquires free medicine, attendance and 
treatment, and, if unable to work by reason of illness, he is partially 
supported for a reasonable time, determined by special conditions. 

Dr. George M. Kober, in his report for the Committee on So- 
cial Betterment for the President's Homes' Commission, 1908, states 
that the result of the workingmen's insurance system in Germany 
has been as follows: "The hygienic conditions of the workingmen 



84 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

have been improved, both on account of the safeguards which the 
accident insurance organizations require employers to use and be- 
cause of the special efforts made by the 'sick funds' to reduce the 
sick rate among the members to a minimum. The general knowl- 
edge in regard to the preservation and promotion of health, which 
the 'sick fund organizations' have disseminated by means of circu- 
lars, monographs, popular lectures, etc., has exerted a tremendous 
educational influence in the promotion of health and morals. One 
of the most beneficent features of the entire system has been that 
parts of the funds of these organizations are invested in model 
houses, hospitals and sanatoria for the use of members." 

And Professor Henderson states: "Property is owned to the 
amount of $408,000,000, of which $120,000,000 have been invested 
in workmen's dwellings, hospitals and convalescent homes, sanatoria, 
baths and similar institutions of welfare." 

Not least among the benefits of this industrial insurance system 
is the important fact that it largely tends to eliminate the elements 
of anxiety and worry over conditions of illness which so often re- 
tard convalescence. Another benefit consists in securing for the 
workman prompt and skillful care which he otherwise would prob- 
ably be unable to obtain. 

HYGIENE OF THE WORKROOM AND FACTORY 

As Dr. Alice Hamilton has said, "The hygiene of a factory de- 
pends much more upon the management than upon the construc- 
tion." 

Space. It is difficult to formulate rules for proper space in 
factories; for space which may be ample for certain employments 
is far too restricted in others where dusts and fumes or other 
deleterious substances pollute the air, where too close proximity to 
machinery favors accidents, or where an accumulation of manufac- 
tured material constantly encroaches. In general, factory laws, in 
the States where they exist, demand from 250 cubic feet of air per 
occupant (as in Xew York State) to 300 cubic feet. In many of 
the factory laws the floor space per occupant is defined as well as 



PROPHYLAXIS 



85 



the cubic air space. But in a large factory room a mere space 
law is inadequate for controlling health conditions ; for parts of 
the room may be sanitary from proximity to open windows or blow- 
fans, but other parts may be most unhealthful, where dusts accu- 
mulate, or undesirable conditions of moisture and heat prevail. In

TILATED WORKROOM. Note the broad windows, open hoods over forges,

ducts. (From Rauch und Staub.) 

some industries, as in chrome works, lead works, etc., the packing 
of injurious materials may be conducted in a very unsanitary room 
which communicates too directly with an otherwise healthful one. 
In such cases double sets of self-closing doors should be provided 
when possible. 

Flooring. The flooring of workrooms is a matter of great im- 
portance. Many toxic metallic and other dusts work into wooden 
floors and accumulate so that where such dusts are generated it is 
desirable to have the floor made of cement, asphalt, concrete, tiles 
or some similarly impervious material, which presents a hard, 
smooth surface and may be thoroughly washed daily. Similar 
flooring should be used wherever animal products are dealt with, as 
in tanneries, slaughter houses, bone fertilizing plants, etc., so that 
it can be cleaned with antiseptics. Such floors, however, are often 
cold and hard to stand upon all day, as in tending a loom or card- 



80 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

ing machine, and in factories of this order wood flooring may be 
preferable, or, if harder floors are used, the workmen may be given 
strips of linoleum to stand upon. Silicate solutions are sometimes 
applied to both floors and walls to render them impervious to moist-

ure and dust. Whenever workmen are employed in work where 
the floors are liable to be constantly wet, or where acid or dye solu- 
tions may be spilled, as in tanneries, paper mills, pottery glazing 
rooms, dye houses, etc., their feet should be protected by standing 
upon wooden or other slabs, raised a few inches above the floors. 

Ceilings and walls should be limewashed two or three times a 
year or freshly painted once a year, and beams, shelves, corners, 
sills and all recesses should be kept dust free as far as possible. 

Lighting. Proper lighting of workrooms is most important. 
Good daylight, and especially sunlight, is necessary for purifying 
the air, besides improving the cheerfulness of surroundings and con- 
sequently the morale of the worker. The evil effects upon the eyes 



PKOPHYLAXIS 87 

of wrongly placed artificial lights are described under Eye Strain, 
and illustrated in Figures 7a and 7b. In addition to the effect upon 
the health of poor light is the extra hazard from accidents from ma- 
chinery or otherwise which it engenders. 

The construction of many modern factories with walls largely 
composed of glass in iron frames has done much to promote health 
and efficiency. The area of factory windows should be at least 
one-third of the wall area, and one-sixth of the floor space. In Ger- 
many, for illumination of modern factory buildings, a light area 
of 8^ to lOf square feet for every workman employed is required. 
For the best results in general artificial lighting, factories should 
have light-colored smooth walls for reflection and lights backed by 
reflectors should be suspended near the ceiling. 

In artificial lighting of workrooms in general this overhead sys- 
tem is best, with lights placed well above the natural level of the 
eye. In some cases, however, side illumination is essential^ and 
beams, walls, girders or partitions, when painted white, may often 
be utilized to reflect and diffuse light, and, also, in some cases, to 
conceal it and prevent the glare which causes so much fatigue of the 
workman. Workmen who constantly look down on their work suffer 
less from fatigue than when the eye must glance along horizontal 
and brightly reflecting surfaces, as in polishing bright metals. In 
the latter case, when possible, the light should fall upon the object 
from behind the workman, or at an angle at which it will be reflected 
away from, rather than toward, the eye. C. E. Clewell, investi- 
gating for the Westinghouse Company, writes that in one factory 
"the almost humorous statement was made upon the installation of 
a good overhead system that the men did not wear out their shoes 
as fast as formerly meaning that the matter of getting around had 
been complicated by their stumbling against the loose iron and 
other material which had been allowed to accumulate." 

When the nature of the work requires the use of strong light 
very close to the operator it should always be so placed and screened 
as to prevent injury to the eyes. Brightly shining surfaces, espe- 
cially if in motion, are injurious to the eyes if closely watched. 

Workrooms and storerooms containing. inflammable materials, like

turpentine, benzene, ether, or explosive dusts, like sugar, fine saw- 
dust, flour dust, etc., should be lighted only by electricity, preferably 
from without, through a window, or enclosed lighting plant, and 
entered only with safety lamps. Otherwise, serious explosions and 
burns or other injuries may occur. 

Drinking Water. An adequate supply of good drinking water is 
most essential, particularly in such occupations as expose the work- 




FIG. 8. SANITARY FOUNTAIN WITH COOLED WATER. (Carnegie Steel Com- 
pany.) The box behind the fountain contains ice surrounding a coil of pipe

Steel Institute, June, 1913.) 

men to constant loss of water from the system by perspiration, as in. 
the case of foundrymen, glass blowers, bakers, potters, stokers and 
others exposed to great heat. The concentration of waste matter 
in the system induced by excessive perspiration predisposes to the 
acquisition of constipation, catarrh, rheumatic affections, etc. ; and 
in many cases two or three quarts or more of water daily are needed 



90 



GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



in the system to counterbalance loss through perspiration. On the 
other hand, the drinking of large quantities of ice-cold water at a 
time tends to produce gastric catarrh, dilatation, and diarrhea. 
Hence, the water supply should be easily accessible, so that lesser 
quantities may be drunk at frequent intervals. In certain cases oat- 
meal water or barley water may be supplied with advantage to 
quench thirst and prevent excessive drinking. 




FIG. 9. MULTIPLE SHOWER BATHS FOR CHEMICAL WORKERS. (From the 
Illinois State Department of Factory Inspection.) 

Individual drinking cups are now required by law in many 
states. They may be made cheaply by folding a square piece of 
paraffined paper into a cone or cornucopia; but a vertical tap of 
running water, controlled by a foot pedal which needs no cup, is 
the most hygienic, as well as the most economical arrangement. It 
not only prevents the introduction into' the mouth of poisonous metals 
on the rims of dirty drinking cups or glasses, but, also, the possible 
oral transmission of syphilis. (Fig. 8.) 



PROPHYLAXIS 91 

Washing. Water should also be supplied abundantly for wash- 
ing the face and hands, and in the dusty metallic industries for use 
in cleansing the teeth, as well. Whenever possible the water sup- 
plied for these purposes should be both hot and cold, and this is 
obligatory in lead works under the English factory laws. The best 
bathing facilities which are required in white lead works, chrome 
works and similar extra-hazardous industries are supplied by over-

drying clothes are shown, as well as lockers (on the left), shower baths

head showers or douches. (Fig. 9.) If the workman places a 
handful of soft soap on his head and stands under a douche of warm 
water, he can soon cleanse the body thoroughly with a minimum loss 
of time. Washrooms should be supplied with individual towels, 
and never with roller towels, which are most unsanitary and very 
liable to spread disease. Paper towels, which are very cheap and 
require no washing, are now much in use in the better class of 
factories. 



92 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

Lockers. Individual clothing lockers should be provided, and 
wherever the trade is so hazardous, as in lead works, that a com- 
plete change from the street clothing to working clothes is essential, 
two lockers should be provided for each workman, so that the locker 
contaminated by soiled overalls may not soil the street clothing. 
The lockers should be of metal, with open wire fronts and tops to 
promote free ventilation, and with a separate compartment for shoes 
at the bottom, if they require to be changed. The lockers should be 
fitted, also, with a shelf at the top on which the workman may keep 
his individual towel, soap and nailbrush ; and, in some industries in 
which care of the mouth is most important (as in lead works), a 
toothbrush should also be kept on hand. The lockers should be close 
to the washroom, and, if the occupation is such as to wet the clothing 
or overalls, a drying room with suitable clothes racks should be close 
at hand. (Fig. 10.) 

Cuspidors. Although the spitting habit should be discouraged 
among all workmen, there are many who will not control it, or who 
use chewing tobacco and expectorate the juice. Dried sputum not 
only spreads tuberculosis, but also catarrh and influenza germs. 
The most sanitary cuspidors are flat boxes of wood or metal, at 
least a foot square, filled with dry sand or sawdust, which should 
be renewed frequently. Heavy penalties should be imposed for 
expectorating anywhere else than in a cuspidor. In every factory 
employing large numbers of work people a few are liable to have 
incipient tuberculosis of which they may be unaware. Hence the 
only safe rule is rigidly to control expectoration in every case. 

Toilets. Dirty waterclosets and urinals spread disease, prevent 
proper attention to the normal excrementory functions, and are 
generally demoralizing. The closets should always be separate for 
the sexes, and should be washed daily with a disinfectant. In sev- 
eral States the factory laws require a minimum of at least one 
closet for each twenty-five persons of each sex. The floor should be 
of impervious material, preferably cement, and the closet should 
have access to daylight and outdoor air. Printed rules for keeping 
the closets in sanitary condition should be posted plainly in sight in 
each one. A cold, damp, foul-smelling, dirty closet tends to short-

ening of the process of defecation and is a potent factor in inducing 
constipation. 

Cleaning of Dusty Workrooms. Workrooms should be cleaned 
only when the operatives are ab- 
sent. Metal dust should first be 
wetted down with a water spray 
or wet sawdust, and workbenches, 
seats, window sills, tables, etc., 
should be cleaned with damp cloths 
to prevent agitation of the dust. 
Whenever dry sweeping is done 
much dust rises in the air, only 
to settle again on workbenches 
and seats after the imperfect 
cleaning has been done. When 
possible, dusty machinery or in- 
accessible corners holding dust 
should be cleaned out by a bellows 
or stream of compressed air. 
Floors should be flushed when pos- 
sible, and mopped at least twice 
a week. After the workmen have 
left a dust-filled room sufficient 
time should elapse for the dust to 
settle before it is cleaned. 

Furnaces, evaporating and dry- 
ing chambers, pottery baking 
ovens, brick and lime kilns, etc., 
should not be entered to be emp- 
tied or cleaned until so thorough- 
ly cooled that all dust and fumes 
have had time to settle. It is often 
possible to moisten such oxidizing 
chambers before they are entered 
without damage to the product, 
and this should be done when

practicable. In some cases dust may be allayed by sprinkling a 
surface to be scraped or sandpapered with a non-drying chemical 
oil. In certain industries, like cement making, dust has been suc- 
cessfully precipitated by means of electricity. (See Cement.) 

All packing of dusty material, "heading up of barrels," etc., 

should be done in 
separate rooms 
provided with spe- 
cial ventilation ex- 
hausts, and the 
employees should 
wear respirators. 

Grinding o f 
ores, slag, lead car- 
bonate, chromates, 
pottery scouring, 
and all similar 
extra - hazardous 
dusty work should 
be done by machin- 
ery protected by 
drums, removable 
tight-fitting hoods, 
or other safe- 
guards against 
dust dissemina- 
tion. (Figs.11,12.) 

Joints of containers, machines, conduits, flues, etc., which are 
liable to permit the outward leakage of dusty material should be 
wrapped with thick felt, wool or asbestos to prevent such leakage 
into workrooms. 

The practice of carrying molten metal in uncovered pots through 
the workroom should be prohibited. 

Protection of Receptacles. Kettles, tanks, etc., containing boil- 
ing oil, acids, dyes, etc., which substances are liable to do injury to 
the eyes or skin by spattering, should not be filled to the top, and

should be protected by properly fitting covers, or connected with 
hoods, when necessary, through which toxic fumes may be drawn 
off by exhaust fans. They also should be provided with an over- 
flow channel and receptacle. Openings in the covers to admit the 
stirring and inspection of contents should have sliding valves or 
traps. Pots, kettles, evaporating pans or other receptacles of dan- 
gerous liquids which cannot be covered without interfering with the 
process in hand should be elevated above the floor to a sufficient 
height to lessen the danger of spattering fluids or of inhaling fumes 
when leaning over the receptacles. 

Grinding and Mixing. The grinding and mixing of raw ma- 
terials of toxic nature, such as chrome, lead salts, lime, phosphorus 
paste, etc., should always be conducted in separate apartments, 
especially ventilated, to prevent access of dust to other departments. 
The same rule applies to barreling or packing all such products. 
Respirators, special overalls, or gowns, and head covering should be 
worn while conducting such processes. 

Antidotes and Protectives. In certain industries antidotes for 
poisons or other means for prompt emergency relief should be kept 
close at hand. Where caustic soda or potash is dealt with, syringes 
or wash-bottles filled with pure water should be ready for use in 
case the material be spattered into the eyes, mouth or face. Wher- 
ever strong acids are in use, buckets of water should be at hand, or 
vessels of alkaline solutions, for use in case receptacles of the acids 
be broken or the contents otherwise spattered upon the skin or into 
the eyes. In foundries, acid and dye works and the like, where 
burns of the face, hands or eyes are liable to occur at any time from 
spattering, an emergency kit should be kept always ready contain- 
ing lime water and olive oil (to make the carron oil emulsion), 
vaselin, rubber protective, absorbent cotton, bandages, boric and 
carbolic acid solutions as disinfectants, and brandy. Further emer- 
gency protection of the eyes with oil, etc., is described under Dis- 
eases of the Eyes. 

In powder works, gas plants and all chemical works where the 
workmen might accidentally be asphyxiated by sudden escape of 
poisonous gases or fumes, resuscitation appliances and hypodermic 



9G GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

stimulants should be kept ready for prompt emergency use. (See 
Pulmotor. ) 

In chemical works, where sulphuretted hydrogen or other danger- 
ous gases are liable to be inhaled, respirators should be worn 
charged with moist oxid of iron. 

Where the dressing of hides, making of bone fertilizers, or other 
occupations liable to cause infection through skin abrasions are con- 
ducted, antiseptic solutions with collodion and protective plasters 
should be kept at hand to apply at once to any cut or abrasion of 
the hands. 

In chlorate mills tallow should be used to protect the exposed 
skin. In many industries in which fumes are liable to injure the 
skin of the face it may be protected by smearing with oil, tallow 
or other lubricant. 

Hours of Work. In many excessively hazardous trades it is 
necessary to restrict the hours of work very definitely and prescribe 
intervals of rest. This applies particularly to work in compressed 
air, vulcanizing rubber by means of carbon bisulphid, dinitrobenzol, 
cleaning out the "blue beds" of lead carbonate, phosphorus, and in 
some departments of the felt hat industry. 

VENTILATION OF THE WORKROOM 

The problems of factory ventilation which concern the health 
of the workman are exceedingly difficult to formulate, owing to 
the lack of generally accepted standards and the varied requirements 
of different trades and subdivisions of the same industry. There 
were, in 1911, only ten States having legislation for protection of 
the laborer from toxic gases, vapors and fumes; and in only six is 
this legislation fairly definite as to the use of exhaust and intake 
fans. In general, where many workmen are crowded together in 
the same room, a minimum air space of 250 to 700 cubic feet per 
person is prescribed (as it was in eight States in 1911) for each 
person to work in; but, obviously, much more depends upon fre- 
quent change of the air, dust removal, and that the air space shall 
go with a reasonable floor area, and not include portions of air so 



PROPHYLAXIS 97 

far above the workman's head that it is of little use to him. Factory 
room air becomes vitiated from the following sources: 

(1) Products due to materials consumed in the industry, as 
by combustion ; 

(2) Products liberated from materials used, as by evaporation, 
dust production, escape of gases, vapors and fumes, etc. ; 

(3) Products of incomplete combustion of gas, petroleum, or 
other materials used for heating and lighting, as by gas stoves 
and burners ; 

(4) Products of exhalation from the lungs, skin emanations, 
and expectoration, coughing, etc., of the workmen;' 

(5) Dust and dirt brought in from outside or from adjoining 
dusty workrooms by the shoes and clothing of the workmen ; 

(6) Excessive steam and moisture; 

(7) Impure air supplied by blow-fans which derive the intaken 
air from vitiated sources, as smoke and dust liberated from other 
parts of the building. 

In Manchester, England, it was estimated that in three days 
there fall upon one square mile, as products of incomplete combus- 
tion of coal used in factories, 1,455 Ibs. of soot, 110 Ibs. of sulphuric 
acid and 55 Ibs. of hydrochloric acid. This illustrates the extreme 
degree to which pollution of the air by factories may attain. 

The question of adequate ventilation of factories is twofold, 
dealing first with the ventilation of the building as an ordinary 
problem of air renewal in large rooms with many occupants, and, 
second, with the removal of special products of vitiated air gener- 
ated through processes of manufacture. The first does_not differ in 
principle from ordinary ventilation of large buildings and should, 
as far as possible, be independent of elaborate mechanical appliances. 

The second problem demands forced ventilation by a more or 
less complicated system. I have had much experience with elabor- 
ate ventilation, mechanical systems in hospitals, lecture rooms, etc., 
and am convinced that any air supply which has been superheated, 
humidified or otherwise artificially tampered with is rendered unde- 
sirable thereby. Nevertheless, in many factories, mills, ' chemical 
works, etc., harmful dusts, gases or fumes are evolved incident to 



98 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

the particular variety of manufacture, which must of necessity be 
removed by stronger air currents than can be depended upon from 
natural sources, and forced intake and outflow of air must be main- 
tained by artificial means. 

Many chemical analyses of factory air and dust have been made 
of recent years, and they are frequently of value in determining 
legislation for control of deleterious conditions. The study of the 
effects of polluted air in factories upon the human organism, which 
is of much greater importance from a scientific point of view, has 
heretofore been much neglected. 

The study of the fitness of the air supplied by any artificial sys- 
tem may be tabulated crudely as follows: 

METHODS OF STUDYING THE FITNESS OF THE AIR FOR RESPIRATION 

I. The physiological method II. The physical method 

The use of the nose. The thermostat and thermometer. 

Blood pressure tests. Cubic feet of air supplied per 

hour. 

Metabolism tests; volume and Air analyses, 
composition of expired air. 

Symptom tests, as blood tests, Hygrometry. 
headache, indigestion, dysp- 
nea, etc. 

It will be seen at a glance that these two methods are diametri- 
cally opposite, for the first deals with the man, the other with the 
environment. Yet the former method has been so much neglected 
that few reliable data are obtainable concerning it, while the latter 
method is supported by volumes of highly impressive theoretical cal- 
culations. 

The use of the nose, of a reasonably educated nose, as a means 
of detecting foul air, is entitled to far more respect than it generally 
commands. Bad odors, of course, do not prove that a given atmos- 
phere is irrespirable. Bad odors of a certain kind do prove indis- 
putably that the air is not clean air, that it is not fresh, and that 



PROPHYLAXIS 99 

it has been inside of someone's lungs already or is polluted by for- 
eign substances. One of the most striking of the effects of inhalation 
of stale or foul air by those who are ill with such diseases as pneu- 
monia, pleurisy and other pulmonary affections is the influence upon 
blood pressure. 

In the Presbyterian Hospital, New York City, I have found a 
difference of 20 to 30 mm. in patients placed under the opposite 
conditions of stale and fresh air. In the same patient I have re- 
peatedly measured a difference of 20 mm. on taking the patient to 
the open air, returning him to the ward, taking him out again, etc. 
In the fresh air, the cyanosis disappears, delirium subsides and many 
other symptoms promptly improve. 

Dr. B. Raymond Hoobler, working in my clinic in the wards of 
Bellevue Hospital, New York City, has charted a series of blood 
pressure experiments of this kind, several of which are reproduced 
here from my article on "Ventilation Problems in Hospitals and 
Schools," published in the Heating and Ventilating Magazine, May 
and June, 1912. 

Metabolism tests of the rate of chemical interchange, i. e., of the 
nutrition of the body, involving oxidation processes, as modified by 
air of different sorts, have hitherto been much neglected, but with 
the perfection of modern calorimeter apparatus, as adapted to human 
respiration, such tests are being made and constitute a very con- 
vincing argument for the admission of fresh outdoor air to factory 
workers, in whom it cannot fail to promote efficiency in labor. 

In the case of a patient recently experimented upon for me by 
Drs. Hoobler and Burnham, in Bellevue Hospital, the following 
result was obtained. The patient was left overnight in a small 
room with window tightly closed. A pipe was then introduced 
through which the patient breathed fresh outdoor air while still 
remaining in the closed room. A brief supply of this air lasting 
only fifteen minutes made no appreciable difference, but after the 
window was left open for a couple of hours, all conditions surround- 
ing the patient remaining otherwise the same, the rate of metabolism 
was increased to a very striking degree, as shown by the following 
charts, 13, 14 and 15:

Under some conditions, with poor ventilation or stagnant a>r, a 
variety of symptoms obtains, such as anemia, headache, anorexia, 

etc., or, if they already exist 
from other causes, it is found 
to be impossible to procure 
betterment under the in- 
fluence of poor air. The be- 
havior of these symptoms 
constitutes far more con- 
vincing proof of the real con- 
ditions of the air than any 
theoretical computation of 
the number of cubic feet of 
air supplied per hour, hygro- 
metric tests, etc. 

The value of the carbon 
dioxid test to determine the 
fitness of air for breathing 
has been much questioned, 
especially where attempts are 
made to establish legislative 
standards for factory venti- 
lation. Originally regarded 
as of prime importance, the 
test has been discarded by 
many upon the ground that 
the gas when present in rea- 
sonable quantity is not espe- 
cially injurious. In fact, the 
present tendency is to substi-

over, the only source of CO 2 in an ill-ventilated room occupied by 
human beings (apart from that developed in certain trades) is the 
lungs. Hence, C0 2 accumulation in a room means that the air has 
been breathed many times over by the occupants, and is, therefore, 
unclean air. 

When rightly interpreted, therefore, CO 2 estimation has distinct 
value as a ventilation test of room air. I published in the Medical 
Record of February 9, 1907, 
the results of some very care- 
ful C0 2 tests made for me 
in the wards of the Presby- 
terian Hospital by Dr. C. G. 
L. Wolf. We found that 
when fresh air on the hospi- 
tal roof was practically nor- 
mal (i. e., 4.06 parts CO 2 
per 10,000 volumes of air) 
that in the wards, with the 
most complete closed ventila- 
tion system in full operation, 
contained as much as 4.71 parts CO 2 , and after twenty visitors and 
four nurses had spent one hour in the ward this content rose to 5.13 
parts. 

Immediately thereafter the ward windows were opened for ten 
minutes only, and the CO 2 content at once fell to 4.34 parts, and, 
although on a cold December day, the ward temperature fell only 
3 F. Thus an increase of more than 20 per cent, of CO 2 was 
produced in a short time by the visitors. 

All this constitutes a strong argument for open-window factory 
ventilation wherever it is feasible. There are, however, objections 
to it which in some cases are insurmountable. Window ventilation 
is not strong enough, under ordinary conditions of external air, to 
drive out toxic gases, vapors or fumes developed in the nature of the 
industry; and to make exhaust fans eifective the windows must be 
kept closed, at least where the ducts are very large. This, however, 
need not apply to the operation of small exhaust ducts placed, as

ITIES OF AIR. (Hoobler.)

they should be, whenever possible, close to a localized source of air 
pollution, as. over a small pot of molten lead in a linotype machine, 
or over an emery wheel, as shown in the illustration on page 93. 

In general it may be concluded as follows : 

(1) Whenever possible factories should be ventilated by open 




FIG. 17. SIDE AND OVERHEAD LIGHTING AND VENTILATION OF A COTTON MILL. 
Note the open transoms and skylights and the method of hinging the sash 
to swing as a whole an excellent system. The unshaded electric lights

dust and oil. 



windows, and, if the room be immediately under a roof, by the sky- 
lights as well. (Fig. 17.) 

(2) Heat should be supplied by steam or hot water pipes 
placed below or near the windows. 

(3) The windows should be either of the French casement type 
or hung upon central swivels to open either in the horizontal or verti- 
cal plane. This permits of the entire area of the window frame being 
opened at once (Fig. 17), instead of only half of it, as when the 



PROPHYLAXIS 103 

type of window with sash, cord and pulley is used. Moreover, such 
windows, if made to open outward, may direct the inflowing air or 
control too strong a wind current. 

(4) Transoms should be made to open above all windows and 
doors, and where the windows have several panes, at least one of 
them should be hinged so that it can be opened when the window 
is closed. One of the chief difficulties in window ventilation lies 
in the deep-rooted but fallacious objection on the part of the oper- 
atives to "draughts." Their work often requires good light, hence 
they work as near as possible to windows. They may become over- 
heated, and, from the very fact that they breathe so much foul air, 
their sensitiveness to chilly sensations is greatly increased. By the 
means above suggested, however, the admission of pure outdoor air 
may be largely controlled so as not to annoy the workers. 

In some industries, especially in the spinning and weaving of 
textile fabrics, outside dust entering through open windows might 
prove injurious to the products. Too often on passing a large fabric 
mill in New England, for example, one sees all the windows tightly 
closed even in midsummer. Outside dust may be kept out to a 
great extent by wire or thin cheesecloth window screens, which im- 
pair the lighting very little, but admit air by diffusion. Wherever 
space permits, as it often does in country mills, the outside dust 
nuisance may be abated by growing grass about the mill, and dusty 
roads may be tarred or sprinkled. 

An important matter in factory ventilation is usually ignored. 
It is that overnight, on Sundays, etc., when the rooms are not occu- 
pied the windows should be widely opened to thoroughly freshen 
the air in which large numbers of persons may have to be confined 
for long hours next day. In many cases the windows should be 
opened at the noon hour, where separate lunch rooms are provided. 
As accessories to window ventilation there are two appliances 
which are most effective and in no wise impair the principle con- 
tended for, namely, that air which has been superheated or other- 
wise altered by any artificial system necessarily loses its subtle 
quality of "freshness," on which invigoration of the working body 
so immediately depends, and which, while recognized by everyone, 



104 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

is not capable of measurement or analysis by any physical or chemi- 
cal means at present understood. 

One of these is the use of electric fans so placed about the work- 
room as to keep the air in motion. This has the effect of develop- 
ing gentle air currents, thus aiding diffusion and mixing the air. 
The zone of exhaled air with which everyone tends to surround 
himself when quiescent is broken up, and in warm weather evapora- 
tion from the perspiring surface of the body is promoted. 

The other means consists in establishing vertical flues in the 
walls, opening to the outer air and opening into the workroom two 
or three feet above the floor, precisely like the method which is 
always so successful in ventilating cow barns. The room opening 
should have a sliding door by which its size may be regulated, and 
it may be desirable to set a gas burner within the flue to warm 
the upward current of air. This arrangement corresponds with 
setting a lamp in a bedroom chimney, which everyone should 
know is one of the best and simplest methods of ventilating a bed- 
room. 

Too narrow an interpretation of the records of physical apparatus 
leads to many curious fallacies. One of the commonest of these is 
that with a given ventilation system an unvarying thermometric 
record is a test of its efficiency. Hence, also, the fictitious value 
of the thermostat. 

Nature certainly intended man to have the stimulus to respiration 
and circulation of varying temperatures. The day and night tem- 
peratures vary naturally the world over, except, perhaps, in the 
"dog days" of midsummer, and all the vital phenomena of the body 
are gauged for the stimulus of change and rhythm. 

A second fallacy, common among mechanical engineers, is the 
belief that computation of the number of cubic feet of air supplied 
by artificial force to a room is absolute proof of the quality of the 
ventilation. There might be some reason in this belief if a block, 
so to speak, of good air could be inserted in a workroom and simul- 
taneously drive out another compact block of foul air, as one may 
fill or empty a syringe with air, or work an air pump. A most 
elementary knowledge of the laws of almost instantaneous diffusion 



PROPHYLAXIS 105 

of gases, however, shows how impossible it is to thus "completely" 
change the air in a large room so many times an hour. 

If good air is forced in, it mingles with the foul air, and, in the 
exhaust, a mixture of good air and foul air may be withdrawn. But 
there are always certain currents of such air, despite the diffusion, 
in a large factory, which are dependent upon differences in temper- 
ature at different levels, obstructions of various kinds, and the shape 
of the room, which give rise to stagnant areas where the air is very 
slowly changed. Experiments with smoke and various odors afford 
ample proof of these facts. 

Fresh, clean outdoor air, admitted through a window, is, of 
course, subject to the same laws of diffusion, but it has the advan- 
tage of purity, has not been superheated, and the difference in tem- 
perature which exists, at least, in winter, favors interchange more 
rapidly with the indoor air. 

A third fallacy is that hygrometry affords a complete test of the 
fitness of the air for breathing. It is rather a pity that this test is 
having at present so much attention focussed upon it, for it tends to 
divert investigation from other directions. I have listened to essays 
by enthusiasts according to which, so long as the air was kept at 
65 F., with a relative humidity of 60 per cent., it was perfect for 
purposes of respiration, although it might previously have been 
breathed by a dozen persons and might contain sulphuretted hydrogen 
or carbon dioxid in large proportion, or it might have contained 50 
per cent, of illuminating gas, for all that was stated to the contrary ! 

The question of relative humidity is not so easily disposed of. 
Alternating high and low humidities in time may irritate the respira- 
tory mucous membranes, but atmospheric humidity should not be 
regarded as the sole or most important criterion in determining the 
fitness of -the air to breathe. Superheated or "canned" air, re- 
moistened to the desired humidity of 60 per cent., stagnating in a 
factory room, where it is rebreathed many times, may conform to all 
the physical standards of perfection, yet the workmen may continue 
to grow anemic, lose appetite and strength and suffer from headache 
and other nervous disorders until some humanitarian turns off the 
patent air washer or humidifier in the basement, opens the windows 



106 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

to admit fresh, free-flowing outdoor air, and lets Nature take care 
of the humidity ! 

Humidity, moreover, acts more strongly upon the outer surface 
of the body than upon the ultimate respiratory interchange in the 
lungs ; for upon the moisture and temperature of the air depend the 
other physiological processes of radiation and convection of body 
heat and stimulation of the cutaneous vasomotor nerves, processes 
quite apart from the mechanism of respiration, though often con- 
founded with it in discussions on the fitness of the respired air. 

A fourth common fallacy is the reference to the feeling of per- 
sonal "comfort" to determine the fitness of respired air. Nothing 
could be more misleading, and it is precisely this feeling of "com- 
fort" which makes it so difficult for many persons to tolerate open 
windows. Factory operatives, mill-hands and the like often say 
they are perfectly "comfortable" in an atmosphere which, to an 
outsider, is obviously extremely deleterious, if not seriously toxic. 
A man in my clinic in Bellevue Hospital was admitted in coma from 
accidental gas poisoning. When he recovered I asked him particu- 
larly about his initial sensations. He had not been in the least "un- 
comfortable" in an atmosphere surcharged with gas, in which he lay 
down and calmly went to sleep. I have seen many such patients, 
but recall none who was "uncomfortable," excepting as the odor of 
escaping gas is disagreeable to most persons. 

This sensation, therefore, is a dangerous index of proper ventila- 
tion, being, in many cases, referable to cutaneous vasomotor and 
sensory conditions wholly apart from the mechanism of respiration. 

The foregoing statements have largely been quoted from my 
article on "Ventilation Problems in Hospitals and Schools" in the 
Heating and Ventilating Magazine, May and June, 1912. 

Haldane states that still indoor air is "uncomfortable 1 ' with the 
wet bulb thermometer at 70 F. and the room temperature high. I 
have personally, however, been perfectly "comfortable" with the wet 
bulb temperature at 74 and room temperature at 78 F., with air 
stirring from a window, and extremely "uncomfortable" outdoors 
with the wet bulb marking only 71 and the dry marking 76 F. 
At another time I have been very comfortable under identical con- 



PROPHYLAXIS 107 

ditions, but with more air stirring. Haldane further states that, if 
the wet bulb temperature rises above 80, elevation of body tem- 
perature may occur, and, if it be 88 to 90 F., the body temperature 
rises, even if one is naked and doing no work. In England, however, 
such midsummer conditions of humidity with high temperature 
rarely obtain as are so common in the Eastern and Middle United 
States; and in England the wet bulb temperature rarely reaches 
70 F. in the open air even in the hottest summer. 

Relative humidity is often quoted, but, as Haldane says, it is the 
wet bulb reading in connection with the atmospheric temperature 
which preferably should be cited. 

It is a pleasure to note the reaction which is already taking place 
in regard to hygrometry. In the issue of the Heating and Venti- 
lating Magazine for December, 1911, Rosenau and Amos conclude: 
''There has recently been a growing tendency to regard the ill-effects 
of vitiated air as due to the increased temperature and moisture, but 
it is now apparent that there are other factors which must be taken 
into account." 

The point I wish to emphasize and which often is lost sight of is 
that it is not absolute standards of humidity alone which should be 
regarded in determining the healthfulness of the surrounding air in 
the workroom. I have dwelt at length on this matter because the 
English laws determine standards of humidity in many occupations, 
especially cotton and jute spinning. In this country the question 
has not thus far been arbitrarily formulated by legislation, no doubt 
because in summer in many parts of the country the natural atmos- 
pheric humidity exceeds the English legal standards and it is of 
course futile to legislate against natural phenomena. 

Humidity, the moisture or dryness of the body surface and of 
the clothing, the motion of the air and its temperature, all enter 
into the relative comfort of the individual. Shortly after eating a 
heavy meal one may be uncomfortably cold in the same atmosphere 
in which he later becomes comfortable, owing to the deflection of 
blood from the surface of the body to the viscera during digestion. 
Ill health and feeble circulation, age and many other factors affect 
the sensation of comfort in different atmospheres. 



108 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

The previous discussion deals with the problems of factory venti- 
lation in general, where it may be possible to employ open windows 
and skylights, and supply necessary heat in winter by radiators. 
There remains the problem of ventilation where these conditions are 
made impossible from one or more of the following reasons: 

(1) The nature of the products manufactured may require 
closed windows to keep out dust or retain a larger degree of moist- 
ure, artificially supplied, than is usually present in the outside air. 

(2) The harmful substances produced incidentally to the 
manufacture may be present in such volume that forced air cur- 
rents are necessary to drive them out of the room and keep the air 
respirable. Such are most of the toxic gases, vapors and fumes, and 
many of the dusts. 

(3) The dusts produced may be so heavy, as in the case of 
emery dust, steel and brass filings, sand from sand blasting, etc., 
that they will not pass out of a window, but must be forcefully 
aspirated. 

(4) The temperature and humidity developed may be so great 
as to require a forced air intake to neutralize the harmful effects. 

(5) Outdoor weather conditions may exceptionally be so poor as 
to render closure of the windows necessary. 

In all these circumstances air must be supplied through intake 
ducts of large size, so placed as to disturb both the dust and the 
workmen as little as possible. Such air currents are now almost 
universally supplied by rotary fans contained in large drums and 
propelled at great velocity by steam or electric power. The air thus 
supplied may be filtered by drawing it through cloths or wire mesh, 
and, if necessary, moistened by sprays of steam or water, or by 
passing over wet cloths or other wet surfaces from which the moist- 
ure is derivefl by evaporation. It is best, however, in all cases to 
supply heat and air by independent systems, i. e., by radiators inde- 
pendent of the air ducts, for in this manner the air need not be super- 
heated, and the temperature of the workroom is more easily regu- 
lated. Moreover, on occasions the windows may be opened and 
fresh air admitted without using the ducts, but retaining the heat 
supply if necessary. In large factories it often happens that dif- 



PROPHYLAXIS 109 

ferent temperatures are required in different rooms. The intake 
ducts for each room should be so arranged with valves or doors that 
the air from any duct may be turned off without dislocating the 
entire ventilation system of the building. This is a very important 
matter too often neglected. With independent supply ducts and

OUTLET. White lead works. (From the Illinois Department of Factory 
Inspection.) 

independent heat source it becomes possible to secure all manner of 
variations of the atmospheric conditions in different rooms, and 
results further in considerable economy in heating. 

The outlet or suction ducts should be placed as far away from 
the intake ducts as possible, so as not to short-circuit the air cur- 
rents. I have seen them erroneously placed side by side, so .that the 
entering air was deflected and immediately drawn out again without 
benefiting the general air of the room. In general the inlet ducts 



110 



GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



should enter the room at a height of from four to six feet above the 
floor, and outlet ducts both near the floor and ceiling, for many toxic 
gases are heavy and should be drawn downward away from the 
workman's face; whereas air vitiated by human exhalations and 
products of illuminating gas combustion, when heated, tends to rise, 
although carbon dioxid is somewhat heavier than air. This applies 




FIG. 19. SECTIONAL VIEW OF A CARDING MACHINE DEVISED BY V. HUGO OP 
LILLE, FRANCE, SHOWING EXHAUST SYSTEM FOR REMOVING DUST PLACED 
BENEATH THE MACHINE AND THE FLOOR. Such machines making several 
hundred revolutions a minute tend to throw off dust in all directions by 
centrifugal force which is counteracted by the suction applied through the 
grating under the machine and in front of the workman who stands behind 
it. (L. Grillet, "L'hygiene du travail.") 

to the majority of workrooms where the room as a whole must be 
emptied of widely diffused deleterious air. 

But special problems arise in connection with ventilation wher- 
ever harmful gases, vapors or fumes are locally produced from pots, 
boiling kettles, evaporating pans, impregnated steam jets, etc. In 
such cases hoods or tight-fitting covers connected with the air ducts 
must supplement the general ventilation system of the room. In 
some cases where a number of separate dust foci exist, as about 
emery wheels, carding machines, etc., a large number of separate 



PROPHYLAXIS 111 

exhaust ducts may be required (Fig. 18), so that one may be placed 
close to each machine, either above it or in the floor beneath it, and 
they may, if sufficiently numerous, replace the wall ducts. The 
latter, in fact, may be undesirable as causing cross circuits of air 
and tending thereby to distribute the dust before it is aspirated out 
of the room. Similarly the inlet ducts in the walls may sometimes 
be replaced by smaller ducts behind the workman or at one side, so 
that the deleterious air is forced away from him and driven directly 
into the aspirating ducts. The latter .should, whenever possible, be 
operated by electric fans placed near the outlet to the outside air 
on account of the extreme ease with which their velocity and opera- 
tion are controlled. When the outlet duct is placed beneath the 
workman's feet in the floor it is covered by a grating, or it may bo 
in the machinery itself, as where a grating over a duct is used for 
sorting wool, hair or other particularly dirty dusts. (Fig. 19.) 

In a straw hat factory in Baltimore, originally constructed with- 
out ventilation, the winter sick rate was 27.5 per cent, among the 
work people. After proper ventilation was secured the rate fell to 
only 7 per cent., and the company found that the apparatus installed 
was paid for in a year by the gain in efficiency. 

Further discussion of this important topic will be found under 
the heading Dust Prevention. 

HYGIENE OF THE WORKMAN 

Although it is true that most of the workers in the poisonous 
metals are warned of their danger, my experience with them is that 
each man usually thinks he will prove an exception to the rule, and, 
like the coal miner, long accustomed to deal with fire damp, finally 
forgets the danger and courts disaster. Ignorant workmen, especially 
foreigners, will often neglect to follow rules of cleanliness or avail 
themselves of many of the means of protection offered. Neverthe- 
less, much may be accomplished by instruction, inspection and some- 
times a system of rewards for obeying the directions given; and 
these should be applicable in the home as well as in the factory, mill 
or workroom. 



112 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

Exercise. Those whose work is of sedentary character should 
endeavor to walk both to and from the place of work to the home, 
or, if the distance is too great, to walk part way. If it be impos- 
sible to walk both ways, the morning is preferable to the evening 
for walking, because after a day of fatigue walking may cause so 
much exhaustion as to impair digestion of the evening meal. Or, in 
such cases, it may be we'll to ride toward home the first part of the 
way, walking a few blocks at the end, in order to breathe deeply 
and inhale good fresh air. In walking the head should be held 
erect and the shoulders thrown well back to obtain maximum inhala- 
tions. When weather or other conditions do not permit of walking 
in the open air it is most desirable on rising and again on retiring 
to practice deep-brea thing exercises in front of an open window, 
swinging the arms above the head and bending the body at the waist 
in different directions. These details are particularly important for 
women and young girls, whose occupations are often sedentary and 
who tend to become constipated and anemic, for they frequently 
have never learned to breathe properly. Correctly adapted exercises 
which strengthen the action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles 
.are of service in overcoming constipation. 

Occupations which involve constant exercise are often conducted 
under such poor conditions of ventilation as to be merely fatiguing 
and injurious; and, under such circumstances, the respiratory 
muscles are rarely used to the best advantage, and supplementary 
calisthenics in good fresh air are very desirable. Such exercises 
taken for ten minutes at the noon hour should also be prescribed. 
In New York City, in the garment workers' districts, one may see 
thousands of workmen who every day at noon come out and stand at 
the street corners or walk slowly about. If they could be induced 
to walk briskly for ten minutes, swinging the arms and inhaling 
deeply, or if they would practice the "setting up drill," their health 
would be promoted and efficiency much increased. 

Tolman and Guthrie, in "Hygiene for the Worker," refer to one 
factory employing 1,000 operatives in. which at the noon hour the 
employees are permitted to dance, the music being furnished by 
volunteers. Although this is not outdoor exercise, if the room be 



PROPHYLAXIS 113 

well ventilated, it gives opportunity to relieve the fatigue of certain 
muscles by exercising others, promotes breathing, and has the great 
advantage of introducing the element of mild diversion. On the 
other hand, in some department stores, telephone exchanges and other 
establishments where girls and young women are employed, rest 
rooms are furnished where complete rest may be secured at noon. 

Conditions of work are so variable that it is impossible to formu- 
late definite rules for all cases, but the essential principle is to secure 
a proper balance between physiological rest and exercise and to see 
to it that as often as possible during the day, whether at work or at 
home, deep inhalations of pure fresh air be secured. The sewing 
girl who sits at her work eight or nine hours a day is more in 
need of exercise than of rest at noon; but the loom tender who is 
on her feet for a similar period may derive more benefit from sit- 
ting or lying down. It is good economics for employers of large 
numbers of working girls to look thoroughly into this, as well as other 
principles of fundamental hygiene. In some few large manufac- 
turing establishments gymnasiums have been installed where light 
calisthenics may be taught and practiced. 

Bathing. A full hot bath should be taken at least twice a week, 
soaking and soaping the body well. If the occupation has involved 
exposure to irritant dusts, vapors or fumes, the body should be 
sponged with warm water and well rubbed every night before retir- 
ing. More restful sleep will thus be secured and the skin will be 
kept free from eczema and other forms of irritation. A cold 
sponge bath should be taken every morning on rising, cold water 
at this time being more invigorating and refreshing than hot. Where 
no bathtub is accessible for full baths, a large wooden washtub will 
serve for immersing portions of the body in succession. The term 
"sponge bath" is not to be taken literally, for few workmen can 
afford to buy sponges, besides coarse wash rags are more hygienic, 
being more easily kept clean. Workers who are exposed to the 
fumes of molten metals should be afforded facilities for daily shower 
baths before going to their homes. (See Treatment of Lead Poison- 
ing-) 

Washrooms should be provided for all workmen, but they be- 



114 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

come an absolute necessity in lead works, nitroglycerin works, and 
all establishments in which toxic materials are handled. The British 
laws require that they shall be fitted with basins in the proportion 
of at least one for every five workmen, or with porcelain-lined 
troughs of a length of at least two feet for every five workmen. 
They must be supplied with running hot and cold water, soap, nail 
brushes and individual towels. The workmen at meal time and 
before leaving the factory must be allowed at least ten minutes for 
ablutions. They should wash the face as well as the hands, and 
should scrub the nails thoroughly, for lead and similar metal dusts 
are readily conveyed from unclean finger nails to food. The soap 
supplied should be fluid and held in containers from which it may 
be poured without contamination. 

Shower baths with hot and cold water are supplied in the better 
class of lead smelting and white lead works, chrome works, nitro- 
glycerin plants, also in connection with many other industries in 
which very toxic materials are dealt with, or very dirty dusts, such 
as that of coal mines. Employees should be compelled to take a 
shower bath at least twice a week, or in some cases daily on quitting 
their day's work. (See Fig. 9, page 90.) 

Care of the Mouth and Nose. All workers in dusty atmospheres 
should frequently cleanse the mouth and nose. For the mouth and 
throat a wash and gargle of either common salt or boric acid solution 
should be used, in strength of about half a teaspoonful to the cup 
of water. For the nose a warm salt solution of the same strength 
may be used by inhaling a little of the fluid poured into the palm 
of the clean hand, or poured with a spoon into the nostrils and 
blown gently out again. In the nostrils the dust will thus be pre- 
vented from encrusting with the mucus and causing ulceration and 
chronic catarrh. Rinsing the mouth frequently aids in preserving 
the teeth, but in addition they should be well brushed on rising and 
retiring with a simple inexpensive powder or with castile soap. 

Care of the Teeth. Whereas proper preservation of the teeth is 
important for everyone, it is doubly so for workmen in certain hazard- 
ous trades on account of especially corrosive substances which may 
enter the mouth as fumes or otherwise. Decayed teeth almost al- 



PROPHYLAXIS 115 

ways tend to impair digestion. With them are associated more or 
less gingivitis and alveolar abscess. The latter may lead to caries 
of the alveolar cavities, and the constant presence of pus in the 
mouth favors the production of anemia and sometimes of chronic 
sepsis. The worst form of decay of the teeth and maxillary caries 
results from phosphorus poisoning, and next in deleterious effect 
ranks mercury. The fumes of all the mineral acids produce erosion 
of the enamel and further decay of the teeth, and some of the chronic 
metal poisonings like those of lead and copper give rise to deposits 
in the gums and more or less gingivitis, which may assume an ul- 
cerative type and be accompanied by salivation. 

Antiseptic and cleansing mouth washes, such as boric acid or 
thymol solutions, should also be supplied freely and employees 
should be instructed in their use. 

In lead and chrome works and similar establishments in which 
poisonous substances may enter the mouth, and particularly where 
phosphorus and mercury are used, the workmen should be supplied 
with tooth brushes and instructed to make thorough use of them 
before eating. In these industries the workmen's teeth should fre- 
quently be inspected and treated when necessary, for it is through 
cavities in carious teeth that such poisons are certain to gain access 
to the system. 

Care of the Hands and Nails. The hands should always be 
washed after going to the toilet and before meals. Whenever pos- 
sible they should be washed in warm water with soft soap and 
cleansed with a stiff nail brush. Individual towels should be insisted 
upon for use after washing the face and hands, and the common 
roller towel should be discarded as liable to communicate disease. 
In some large factories paper towels are furnished which may be 
torn off from a roller and thrown in a hopper to be burned after use. 
The finger nails should be kept fairly short to prevent tearing and 
the accumulation of dirt. Workers in metals of all kinds, and 
especially lead, should pay particular attention to these directions. 
In English lead industries such directions are comprised in the 
details of factory laws, and their rigid enforcement is one of the 
chief agencies in reducing the frequency of lead poisoning. 



116 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

Care of the Hair. The hair, if not properly protected, affords 
a means of conveying dust and dirt into the home. Workmen in 
dusty occupations, or who are exposed to irritating fumes and gases, 
should keep the hair short, and it is best not to grow beard? or 
mustaches. Lead dust, condensed lead fumes, chrome dust and 
many other irritants may condense upon the beard, be conveyed in 
the hair of the face or scalp, get into -the food and be swallowed. 
Women in dusty occupations should protect the hair by wearing 
close-fitting paper or oilskin caps. 

In general the hair should be shampooed at least once a week 
with tincture of green soap or castile soap, and the scalp well 
massaged. Men who work as lead smelters or in making white lead 
should wash the scalp daily before going home. 

Stiff hats that fit too tightly impair the circulation in the 
arteries of the scalp and interfere with the nutrition of the hair. 
Lead and other poisonous metal dusts are easily carried home in the 
hair or beard, as well as clothing, and disseminated in the work- 
man's dwelling. 

Care of the Eyes. Workmen who have to look at bright moving 
metal surfaces, as in polishing steel, should protect the eyes by col- 
ored glasses, or, if there is danger of breaking the glass by flying 
metal or stone particles, celluloid eye shields may be used. Close- 
fitting goggles, like automobile goggles, should be used wherever 
irritant dusts such as chrome dust, cement dust, etc., may injure the 
conjunctivas, and at the close of the day's work the eyes should be 
bathed with a saturated solution in warm distilled water of boric 
acid, poured into the eyes with an eye'cup or clean medicine drop- 
per. If artificial lights are placed near the workman, especially 
electric lights, they should never 'be directly in front, but above or 
at the side, and he should avoid looking directly at any bright lights. 
The special dangers to which the eyes are exposed in glass blowing, 
metal casting, electro-metallurgy, X-ray work, etc., are described in 
the section on Diseases of the Eye. 

Eye shields or goggles are made of various materials, such as plain, 
colored or wired glass, mica, transparent celluloid, and fine wire 
screening. The latter are especially for use where flying particles 



PROPHYLAXIS 



117 



of metal or stone or similar substances might splinter glass or render 
it opaque by frequent contact. Colored glasses are worn to pro- 
tect the eye from bright surface reflection or the actinic or ultra-

violet rays of strong electric light, as in electro-welding, etc. (See 
Injuries from Excessive Light.) 

Protective masks and helmets are made of a number of materials, 
such as leather, steel wire, canvas, cloth, mica, celluloid, cardboard, 
etc. They may cover the entire head and be fitted to the shoulders, 
to keep out dust, like the masks or hoods used in sand-blasting, or 
they may be made merely to fit over the face or the eyes. (Fig. 
20.) Helmets are made of strong light material like a fireman's 
helmet, from the rim of which a heavy cloth, canvas or leather pro- 
tector drops down and is secured to the overalls at the shoulders in 
such manner as to exclude dust as much as possible. Fresh air is 



118 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

supplied to the workman through a rubber tube which may enter 
the helmet either at the top (as shown in the illustration above) or 
at the side of the helmet. 

Respirators are described under that heading. 

Care of the Feet. It is distinctly worth while for workmen to 
keep the feet in good condition, for this does much to prevent fatigue 
in those who have to stand through long hours. Ill-fitting shoes, 
which tend to produce flat-foot, blisters, bunions, etc., greatly impair 
efficiency, and by pain or discomfort which they cause give rise to 
secondary troubles of various sorts. Female employees especially, 
who stand all day, as in tending looms or other machines, should 
keep an extra pair of easy shoes to work in, changing them for 
street shoes on going home. 

In some occupations, as in chrome works, lead works, etc., irri- 
tant dusts are liable to work their way through ill-fitting or worn- 
out shoes to the feet and give rise to blisters, ulcers, callosities, etc. 
In dinitrobenzol and nitroglycerin works special care has to be taken 
that the workmen's shoes are thick-soled and in good repair, to pre- 
vent absorption of these highly toxic materials through the feet. 

Workmen exposed to any of these risks should bathe the feet and 
change the stockings, if possible, before going home, and employees 
of every kind whose work compels standing will find that soaking 
the feet in warm water at night does much to lessen fatigue and pre- 
vent the excessive local sweating, which is another common source 
of irritation. This condition may be relieved by bathing the feet 
with a weak solution of alum or Labarraque's solution. (See Hy- 
peridrosis. ) 

Stockings with holes or hard seams should not be worn. Where 
the nature of the work involves standing on wet floors, as in dyeing 
rooms, tanneries, paper mills, etc., wooden racks should be provided 
to keep the feet from the floor. Foreign workmen often wear wooden 
shoes while employed in such occupations, for rubber shoes, if worn 
constantly, induce perspiration of the feet and are fatiguing. 

To aid in overcoming flat foot, as well as to relieve fatigue and 
foot deformities of every sort, massage is most useful, applied twice 
daily, by the workman himself. The thumb should be placed under 



PROPHYLAXIS 119 

the arch of the foot and rotated with firm pressure while the toes 
are repeatedly flexed with the fingers. (See Flat-foot.) The ankles, 
too, should be massaged. Cacao butter or vaselin is a useful ad- 
junct to the massage. The arch of the foot may be strengthened 
also by special exercises, such as walking a few steps on the outside 
of the bare feet, and raising the body well up on the inturned toes. 
Varicose veins in the legs are common among laundresses, motor- 
men, car conductors, loom tenders, and others who stand in one 
position while at work. Massage, bandaging and the wearing of 
elastic stockings afford the best means of relief, and tight garters 
should never be worn. 

Position While at Work. Faulty positions of the body, especially 
those which impair breathing, are productive of many evils. (See 
Abnormal Positions of the Body.) They often may be overcome by 
correcting habit, and are otherwise best counteracted by taking a few 
minutes every hour or two for calisthenics. The time thus lost from 
work will be more than gained through greater efficiency while at 
work and the saving of days of invalidism. 

Sleep. Sleep, which is so essential to counteract the workman's 
fatigue, owing to the poverty of the home environment, is often a 
problem needing serious consideration, for many of the causes of 
impaired health of workmen originate in the home rather than the 
workshop. Without sleep many of the occupational neuroses are 
much more liable to be developed. Too often, from poverty, con- 
ditions such as uncomfortable bedding, overcrowding and living in 
noisy surroundings, sleep is greatly impaired, but a very common 
and most important factor is foul air. In summer the small or 
crowded bedroom becomes overheated, and in winter, from dread of 
cold, with tight-shut windows and often a gas stove, oxidation is 
lessened and sleeplessness, anemia and other conditions arise which 
are often erroneously attributed to the nature of the workman's 
occupation or his occupational surroundings. Abundant fresh air 
in the sleeping room is a need of the importance of which the work- 
ingman should duly be impressed. No sleep is restful or profitable 
without good air, and proximity to a window kept open both at top 
and bottom is a first requisite, worth oftentimes the sacrifice of other 



120 

features of the home. It should be impressed upon the workmen 
that the air is needed as much in winter as in summer, and, in fact, 
more so; for in winter the use of gas stoves, oil lamps, or other 
forms of combustion pollute and exhaust the air of the bedroom. 

Heavy bed clothing is fatiguing. It should be warm but light, 
and cold air may be prevented from coming up through a thin mat- 
tress by a sheet or two of builder's paper or similar material. High 
pillows tend to cramp the head on the chest and bend the thorax 
to the side, thus restricting breathing. Thorough airing and sun- 
ning of the bed clothing every day is most desirable. Those who 
perform night work should seek sleep at once in the day, before 
doing other things. If the neighborhood be noisy, cotton should be 
put in the ears to shut out sound, and, if light cannot otherwise be 
shut out, the upper eyelids may be darkened by touching them with 
burnt cork. 

To avoid insomnia from other causes the lungs should be well 
filled with fresh air before retiring, a glass of hot milk may be 
drunk, and in courting sleep the arms should be placed above the 
head. If the feet are cold they may be warmed by placing a couple 
of beer bottles in the bed, filled with hot water and encased in stock- 
ings to prevent them from burning, if too hot. 

The circular issued by Dr. Sheldon to the working people who 
attend my medical clinic has been given on page 80. It comprises 
many of the directions above discussed in detail. 

Clothing. The workman's clothing should be adapted to the par- 
ticular nature of his work, as well as to climate. Overalls or special 
working clothes are more generally worn in foreign countries, such 
as Germany and France, than in the United States, where many per- 
sons appear to think that a workman's uniform is a badge of servil- 
ity which reflects unfavorably upon his independence ; for when seen 
in public he does not like to be distinguished by such a costume, for 
instance, as the Frenchman's blouse and cap, but prefers a woolen 
suit and impractical stiff hat. But, on-the score of economy, comfort 
and cleanliness, overalls, or rather special working suits, should be 
worn, for in hot rooms or hot weather practically all street clothing 
may be discarded for them. In some industries in this country, 



PROPHYLAXIS 121 

such as that of mining, the manufacture of lead products, etc., and 
in many dusty trades, the use of a working suit is now insisted 
upon, but the importance of the matter should be more widely under- 
stood. The effect of the workman's taking dust and dirt and (as in 
the case of lead and mercury) often toxic materials to his home in 
perspiration-steeped and begrimed clothing is demoralizing for his 
family, disagreeable to those who come in contact with him in public 
conveyances and makes trouble for everyone. 

This whole subject of the workman's proper clothing has been 
especially studied by Dr. George M. Kober, and is so well stated in 
his admirable Report for the Committee on Social Betterment for 
the President's Homes Commission, 1908, that I quote it in full as 
follows : 

"As a general rule, warm woolen goods are best suited for winter 
wear, and cotton or linen for warm weather. It should be under- 
stood, however, that flannels absorb more dirt, odors, germs and 
water than linen or silk, whilst cotton occupies an intermediate 
position. The question of wet clothing, whether from perspiration 
or rain, is important, as the drying of clothing on the body involves 
an expenditure of animal heat, and it is not a matter of indifference 
whether this takes place rapidly or slowly. It is a fact that a wet 
cotton shirt or sweater feels more uncomfortable and colder than a 
wet woolen garment. The simple reason is that the cotton garment 
dries more rapidly, but it abstracts during the same time more animal 
heat than flannels. This fact is not without a practical bearing, as 
it teaches that persons who perspire easily will do well to wear flan- 
nels next to the skin, and this is all the more important when they 
are liable to draughts or abrupt changes in temperature. 

"As a protection against cold, wool is superior to either cotton 
or linen, and should be worn for all underclothing. In case of 
extreme cold, besides wool, leather, fur or water-proof clothing, on 
account of their impermeability to air, are useful. As a protection 
against cold winds, for equal thickness, leather and india-rubber 
take the first rank, wool the second. As a protection against rain, 
india-rubber or oiled canvas clothing is the best, but it is an exceed- 
ingly hot dress, owing to its impermeability to air, which causes 



122 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

condensation and retention of the perspiration. To overcome this 
objection, Dumas suggests a material, which is waterproof and yet 
permeable, prepared as follows: The garment is placed in a seven 
per cent, solution of gelatin, heated to a temperature of 100 F. 
After immersion for a few minutes it is dried in the air, and after 
drying is soaked in a three-quarter per cent, solution of alum and 
again dried. 

"As a protection against heat in the shade, the thickness and 
conducting power of the material are the only factors to be con- 
sidered. Texture has nothing to do with protection from the direct 
solar rays ; it depends entirely on color, and white is the best. As a 
protection against fire, leather clothing is generally worn. The 
fabric can be rendered non-inflammable by the addition of twenty 
per cent, of tungstate of soda and three per cent, of phosphate of 
soda to ordinary starch sizing, while cotton or linen goods may be 
treated simply with starch and borax, in the proportion of a tea- 
spoonful of borax to one-half pint of starch. 

"Clothing as a Cause of Disease. Clothing may impair the 
functions of the body and cause disease : 1, By improper fitting, 
which leads to compression of bloodvessels and nerves and interferes 
with the normal position of organs and the movements of the body ; 
2, By improper selection of material affording either insufficient 
protection or overheating a part or the whole of the body ; improper 
material may also produce irritation or interfere with the ventilation 
of the skin; 3, By wet clothing, which, in drying, may abstract 
sufficient animal heat to cause peripheral irritation and reflex inter- 
nal congestions ; 4, By poisonous dyes, such as compounds of arsenic 
and antimony, chrome yellow, zinc chlorid and some of the anilin 
colors. The toxic symptoms may manifest themselves by general 
impairment of health or in local affections of the skin; 5, Clothing 
may harbor disease germs, and a number of instances are on record 
in which itch, smallpox, tuberculosis and scarlet fever have been 
spread by second-hand clothing and bedding. This points to the 
necessity of thorough disinfection." 

The wearing of tight collars, garters, belts and corsets should be 
avoided. Such collars constrict the vessels of the neck under strain 



PROPHYLAXIS 123 

of heavy work and may contribute to headache, vertigo or other 
vascular disturbance of the head. Tight garters very strongly favor 
the production of varicose veins in those especially who have to 
stand all day at their work. Tight belts and especially tight cor- 
sets tend to cause prolapse of the stomach and kidneys in women and 
such corsets also distinctly impair freedom of respiratory action. 

I once saw a young factory girl who was operated upon in the 
New York Hospital under the mistaken diagnosis of an obscure 
abdominal tumor. She was very weak and had suffered much pain, 
so that she finally died, and autopsy revealed only an hour-glass 
constriction of the liver which had been forced downward and tipped 
over almost vertically by extremely tight lacing. The case was 
reported by the late Dr. George A. Peters in the Medical Record 
many years ago. 

OVERALLS, APRONS AND CAPS. In all occupations involving ex- 
posure to toxic metal dust and fumes, oils, irritant dusts, acids, and, 
in fact, toxic or irritant materials of any kind, overalls should be 
provided. They should be made of washable material, and in lead 
works, nitroglycerin works and all places where toxic substances may 
be retained in them they should be washed at least once a week. 
They should be kept in good repair and in well-aired individual wire 
lockers. Overalls or blouses should not be worn too loose where 
there are projecting parts of machinery on which they are liable to 
be torn. 

Dressing rooms should be provided where the clothing may be 
exchanged for the overalls. In similar occupations caps of imper- 
vious material should be worn to protect the hair thoroughly. For 
women it is often best to provide hoods, and the hair must be so 
dressed as to admit of complete covering. Hoods have the further 
advantage of protecting the ears from such dusts as arise in jute or 
cotton mills, etc., which are liable to cake the natural ear wax and 
cause deafness. Caps and hoods, like the overalls, should be washed 
often. 

In occupations involving constant exposure to steam, wet, or the 
spattering of acid solutions, dye-stuffs, boiling oils, etc., to which 
workers in paper-making, tanning, dyeing, electroplating, etc., are 



124 



GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



exposed, additional protection should be afforded by large aprons of 
leather, rubber cloth, oilcloth or other impervious material. 




FIG. 21. A WORKMAN WELL PROTECTED FROM BRASS AND EMERY DUST. Note 
the good type of dust gown, protection of hair by cap, eyes by goggles, hands 
by gloves, also leather spark brush and properly adjusted rest for the hands. 
The workman is well protected although there is no exhaust duct as shown 
in Fig. 4, p. 42. (From the Norton Company, Worcester, Mass.) 

GLOVES. Gloves of leather or rubber should be worn in indus- 
tries requiring contact of the hands with toxic substances which are 



PKOPHYLAXIS 125 

liable to absorption, like nitroglycerin, or to irritate the skin, like 
strongly acid or alkaline solutions, paraffin or other coal tar prod- 
ucts, etc. When, for any reason, gloves cannot be worn in handling 
irritant materials, the hands may be protected by first coating them 
with grease, oil or vaselin. 

The accompanying illustration, Figure 21, represents a well- 
protected workman with head kept dust-free by a cap, eyes shielded 
from dust and sparks by goggles, hands well covered by gauntlets, 
and body enveloped in a long, loose, comfortable, one-piece washable 
gown. As much of the grinding wheel as possible is screened, and 
a firm, small platform supports the hands. 

Cuts and Abrasions. These should be cared for promptly to pre- 
vent infection. This is always important, but especially so in occupa- 
tions involving the handling of animal materials, as in the work of 
those who deal with hides, slaughtering of animals, bone fertilizers, 
etc. The wound should be cleansed thoroughly with fresh water, 
and adjacent parts cleansed of dirt with soap. A 1-5,000 bichlorid 
of mercury solution should be applied to superficial wounds (when 
not too extensive) and a simple dressing of gauze dipped in the same 
solution bandaged on. Small cuts or abrasions, after thorough dis- 
infection, should be protected by adhesive plaster or several layers 
of flexible collodion. In this manner serious septicemia often may 
be prevented. 

Cold. Measures should be taken for the prevention of the effects 
of cold, such as frost-bite, freezing, and chapped hands. Frozen 
feet, fingers or ears should be rubbed with snow or ice vigorously, 
then treated with cold water, and thoroughly dried and bandaged. 
Frozen parts should never be brought near an open fire or heater. 
The hypersensitiveness of the skin, which long remains, should be 
dealt with by rubbing with salt and cold water twice a day. Chapped 
hands should be dried thoroughly without friction after washing and 
rubbed with camphor ice, which is a compound of lard, vaselin and 
camphor. 

Avoidance of Colds. The workman should be made to realize 
that draughts alone do not cause cold. Most workmen are convinced 
that they do, and strongly object to draughts from open windows, 



126 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

doors, blow-fans, etc. They should learn that fresh air and good 
condition of digestion and of the skin are the best preventives, and 
that all colds or catarrhs are of germ origin. Foul air, fatigue and 
lack of sleep are the real predisposing factors, not draughts of fresh 
air. The latter act only by chilling the body surface, when the body 
is in a condition of lowered vitality or resisting power due to the 
above mentioned causes. With many persons there is definite and 
oft repeated sequence of fatigue, indigestion, constipation, and ex- 
posure to foul air and dust, or inclement weather, after which a 
"cold" or catarrhal fever develops. 

Heat. The effects of great heat should be guarded against. 
During very hot, humid weather one should move slowly, drink no 
alcoholic beverage of any kind, eat Very little meat, and take a 
lukewarm bath before retiring. Outdoor workers, while in the sun- 
light, should protect the head by a cloth wet in cool water, worn 
under a light-fitting hat. Sitting when overheated in a strong 
draught while perspiring, as in front of an air shaft or electric fan, 
cools portions of the body too suddenly or unequally by evaporation 
and tends to produce congestion of internal organs, especially the 
kidneys, or it may produce a localized myalgia, lumbago or neu- 
ralgia, or give rise to stiffness of the joints. 

Acute enteritis is often induced in hot weather by sleeping un- 
covered while perspiring. A sudden lowering of temperature in the 
night chills the surface of the abdomen and a catarrhal enteritis, 
largely due to reflex irritation, results. 

Enough cool water should be drunk in hot weather to replace 
the loss from perspiration, but it should never be poured down in 
large quantities at a time, for in this manner gastric catarrh and 
dilatation may result. In a large factory in which diarrhea among 
the workmen was very common in summer, it was entirely controlled 
by substituting moderately cool water for the ice water which the 
men had previously been in the habit of drinking. 

The use of respirators is discussed fully under Prophylaxis of 
Dust. 

Chewing Tobacco and Gum. The practice of chewing tobacco or 
gum during working hours is especially harmful in industries in- 



PROPHYLAXIS 127 

volving possibility of lead, arsenic, brass or other forms of metal 
poisoning, for the reason that when the workman takes a fresh piece 
out of his pocket with unclean fingers he is certain to convey poison 
to the mouth. The pockets of his overalls, too, are liable to become 
very dirty. Particular instruction should be given as to this hazard 
in the lead and brass industries, and rules regarding it should be 
enforced under penalty of dismissal, for it is difficult to break work- 
men of a long-standing chewing habit which they have never re- 
garded as dangerous. The dyspepsia often induced by these habits 
may become a contributing factor in the ease with which plumbism 
is acquired. 

FOOD AND DRINK 

Food should under no circumstances be eaten in workrooms in 
which there are metallic dusts or fumes, or any substances liable to 
contaminate the food or the hands. Fluid food, such as milk, as 
well as drink, readily absorbs toxic fumes, and dust settles upon 
solid food or is conveyed with it to the mouth by unclean hands. 
Dr. M. A. Starr has suggested the simple expedient of eating foods 
such as sandwiches placed between two sheets of clean paper, so 
that contact with the fingers is avoided ; but this method should not 
be allowed to supplant thorough washing of the hands. A separate 
lunchroom should be available, with arrangements for depositing the 
food which the workman brings with him, so that he need never 
take it into the workroom. It is true that in large establishments 
this involves much additional building space, but it has been abun- 
dantly proven that it promotes efficiency by conserving the health of 
the workmen. 

In certain especially hazardous occupations, such as cleaning out 
flues in which metal vapors have left deposit, emptying the "blue- 
beds" of lead carbonate works, in caisson works, etc., it is desirable to 
supply the workmen with food on the premises, such as hot milk or 
hot soup, to prevent exhaustion or protect the stomach from absorp- 
tion of toxic substances. On leaving a caisson after work under 
high pressure this is absolutely imperative. 

Workmen in especially poisonous industries should be instructed 



128 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

to eat hearty meals before beginning work, for an empty stomach 
and dyspepsia are conditions which are most favorable to the acqui- 
sition of many forms of poisoning. In very hazardous trades, par- 
ticularly those involving exposure to metal or acid fumes, phosphorus 
or mercury, the use of intoxicating beverages more than doubles the 
hazard of poisoning. Particularly is this true of caisson men. A 
good supply of drinking water does much to prevent alcoholism by 
relieving thirst, particularly in industries such as smelting, pottery 
baking, stoking, and all similar work in which heat or heat and 
moisture in the atmosphere in excess induce constant perspiration. 

At one manufacturing establishment in a western State the em- 
ployees organized a club in a nearby building, where their employers 
furnished light, heat and room. Here the workmen at the noon 
hour obtain a wholesome hot lunch at a minimum price, and are 
diverted while eating by a phonograph and in other ways. In an- 
other room the girls employed may lunch, read and rest. The effect 
has been, according to Tolman and Guthrie, in "Hygiene for the 
Worker," that, whereas formerly fifty per cent, of the girls were 
constantly giving up their work, there is now a waiting list of em- 
ployees to be taken on. In several other progressive establishments 
the employers have voluntarily furnished lunch and recreation rooms 
where at noon the employees may dance to music of volunteers from 
their own number, or use a library. One of the large cotton mills 
in the South has put up a bowling alley for the men and boys em- 
ployed, and in one of the illuminating gas plants in New York City 
the employees have organized a vaudeville club for mutual enter- 
tainment during the noon luncheon hour. 

In New York State the general labor laws specify that "in each 
factory at least sixty minutes shall be allowed for the noonday meal, 
unless the factory inspector shall permit a shorter time." 

Diet. Very many of the ills often attributed to occupation arise 
from faulty nutrition. In general the fundamental rules of dieting 
are poorly, if at all, understood by the workman, and of the relative 
nutritive value of different foods, particularly in relation to their 
cost, he knows absolutely nothing. It is futile to give him general 
directions they must be specific and concise. In most dispensaries 



PROPHYLAXIS 129 

frequented by industrial workers this all-important topic is greatly 
neglected. 

In my clinic it is the custom to give to each new patient the 
printed circular containing rules for general care of health and 
brief suggestions for diet, reprinted on page 80. 

We have found, however, as a result of considerable experience, 
that many patients are both willing and eager to have more detailed 
instruction. To meet this want Dr. W. H. Sheldon has prepared 
the following circular which is here reproduced in full in lieu of 
further discussion of this subject, as it is adapted for the under- 
standing of the workman, or, more particularly, of his wife, who does 
the cooking. 

In preparing the circular special attention has been given 
to the nature of the foods which come within the limits of the 
workman's purse and which are obtainable throughout the year. 
In any dietary often as much depends upon the preparation and 
proper cooking of food as upon the food itself, hence detailed direc- 
tions for cooking were prepared for the circular by Miss Rose, one 
of the instructors in dietetics in Cornell University, and the wording 
is such as to be comprehended readily by the workman.

GENERAL RULES FOR EATING 

1. Eat very slowly, chew your food well. If possible, rest one-half hour 
after each meal. 

2. Drink water before your meals, instead of with them, or immediately 
after them. 

3. Plan to have variety of foods, including always some fresh vegetable 
or fruit. 

4. The food supplies force for the work of the body, just as coal supplies 
the work of the engine. The coal must be of good quality and right quantity, 
or the work is poor. Just so with food. 



130 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

5. Many foods, especially canned vegetables, supply very little nourish- 
ment in proportion to their cost. Canned vegetables and fruits are mostly 
water and, therefore, are relatively costly. 

6. The best diet for a healthy workingman is a mixed one, in which 
meat is about one-sixth part, bread and cereals about three-sixths, and pota- 
toes or other vegetables about two-sixths. To this are added sugar, butter 
and fresh fruit. 

7. Some foods produce more force in the body than others, that is, a 
man keeps stronger by eating some foods than by eating others. Thus, bread, 
potatoes, eggs, meat, butter, sugar, cheese, peas, beans, oatmeal and corn all 
are strengthening foods. Fresh green vegetables and fruits give variety and 
are wholesome, but do not furnish strength. Fats, such as butter, oil or 
bacon and sugar, are strengthening foods, and these foods as well as cheese, 
peas and beans furnish so much strength as to lessen the amount of meat 
required. Besides they are proportionally cheaper. 

To get the same quantity of nourishment from each of the following foods 
one must take them in these different amounts: 

Milk, one tumblerful 

Condensed milk, sweetened, three heaping teaspoonfuls 

Cocoa, four heaping teaspoonfuls 

Clear stock soup, five teacupfuls 

Eggs, three 

Butter, three lumps (one inch cube) 

Sugar, four heaping teaspoonfuls 

Cheese, four cubes (one inch each) 

Meat, minced, one and one-half tablespoonfuls 

Beans, dry, two tablespoonfuls 

Cereals, cooked (oatmeal, cornmeal, etc.), one teacupful 

Peas, six tablespoonfuls 

Potatoes, two, each three inches long 

Bread, three slices, each four inches square and one-half inch thick 

Oranges, three 

Apples, four 

Prunes, a saucefful 

Both beans and cheese make very good substitutes for meat. For example, 
instead of eating three tablespoonfuls of chopped meat, or a couple of large 
slices of roast beef, or a helping of beefsteak, you can eat four tablespoonfuls 
of beans, or eight cubes of cheese one inch in size. 

Instead of butter, oil or lard used in cooking supplies much nourishment. 

Instead of sugar, molasses or syrup also supplies good nourishment. 

Macaroni is about equal to bread in nourishment. Two teacupfuls of 
cooked oatmeal are equal to a helping of meat. 

The following bills of fare are balanced so as to give variety and the 
right amount of nourishment in the quantities of foods ordinarily eaten :

RULES FOB COOKING 

Raw starch is very hard, often impossible, to digest. Foods containing 
starch should be thoroughly cooked. Dried peas, beans and lentils, potatoes, 
cocoa and chocolate, tapioca and sago and cereals, as oats, wheat, rice, corn, 
barley, etc., contain large amounts of starch and require thorough cooking to 
make them digestible and palatable. 

Cellulose, or woody fiber, which is the supporting substance of all fruits 
and vegetables, legumes and cereals, is often very tough and stringy when 
raw, but may be softened by cooking and thus made more easily digestible. 
Many vegetables and fruits which contain no starch and which may be eaten 
raw are more easily digested when cooked, as baked apples, stewed celery and 
boiled carrots. 

Foods like milk, meat, eggs and cheese are usually more easily digested 
when raw. They are cooked to kill any germs which may be on them and 
to make them taste better. 

Cereals are among the cheapest and most nourishing of all foods and 
should form an important part of the day's meals. If well cooked they will 
be well liked. It takes plenty of water and a long time to cook cereals 
properly, even when, like cornmeal, they are finely ground. 

Dried peas, beans and lentils are a cheap and nourishing substitute for 
meat. 

Fresh vegetables are more wholesome than canned ones and if wisely 
selected they are cheaper. Beets, dandelion greens and spinach, tomatoes, 
lettuce, squash and oyster plant are all cheap at some period during the year. 
Strong juiced vegetables, like cabbage, turnips, onions and parsnips, are cheap 
even in the winter months, and may be made easily digestible by cutting in 
small pieces and cooking in boiling water in an uncovered pan and removing 
them from the stove and draining them as soon as tender. 

Tender parts of meat are expensive, and are often less nutritious than the 
cheaper tough pieces. Tough meat may be made tender in two ways: first, 
by putting the meat through a grinder, and, second, by cooking it for a 
long time at a temperature just below the boiling point of water. 

Eggs are made tough by cooking at a high temperature. They are more 
tender and more easily digested if cooked below the boiling point of water. 



134 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

Skim milk has all the original food value of the milk except the butter 
fat. It is a nutritious food and may be used for cooking and for drinking. 

Milk soups are wholesome, nourishing, good to taste and very easy to 
make. Not only fresh vegetables but yesterday's mashed potatoes or beans, 
or other left-over vegetables may be used to make them. 

Cheese is a cheap and nourishing substitute for meat. When slightly 
cooked it is said to be more easily digested than when raw, but when over- 
cooked it becomes tough and difficult to digest. 

Drippings, oleomargarin, lard, olive oil, cotton seed oil, butterin, etc., 
if clean and well made are wholesome, nutritious foods and make economical 
substitutes for butter. 

A home-made fireless cooker makes the cooking of cereals both easy and 
cheap. The cereal is cooked in the cooker kettle on the top of the stove for 
ten minutes. The kettle is then covered and set in the cooker for several 
hours or over night. It will be warm but not hot by morning and may need 
reheating. Such a cooker may be made from a box or an old trunk by fixing the 
cover to fit down closely, filling up all holes, lining the box with newspapers 
carefully tacked in, and then filling the box with hay, excelsior or finely cut 
up paper closely packed down to a depth of three or four inches. Then a 
pail having a closely fitting cover should be set on the bottom, and hay, excel- 
sior or cut paper packed all around it. The pail can then be removed, and 
leaves a nest in which it can be replaced. A cushion is then made which 
should entirely fill the remainder of the box. If the box is large enough, two 
pails may be used and two nests made. There should be at least three or 
four inches of packing all around the pails and a cushion three or four 
inches thick to go over them. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AS A PRELIMINARY TO CHOOSING 

AN OCCUPATION 

Much occupational disease might be prevented if the workman 
would learn to present himself to a physician or at a dispensary for 
advice as to his fitness for undertaking a particular occupation. In 
my experience with dispensary and. hospital cases among the indus- 
trial workers, this simple precaution is usually left until too late. 
In many cases, of course, the workman has no choice and must take 
whatever "job" he can get, but I constantly see working people whose 
occupations are slowly but s\irely producing lesions which are bound 
sooner or later to incapacitate them completely. For example, a 
young man with a mitral heart lesion due to rheumatism should 
avoid trades in which he must do heavy lifting or remain long hours 
upon his feet. A nervous young girl with chlorosis should avoid 



PROPHYLAXIS 135 

work in crowded workshops where there are confusion and hurry of 
"speeding up." A worker with poor chest expansion and a tendency 
to catarrhal processes should avoid occupations involving exposure 
to noxious dusts or fumes, such as file-cutting, glass or button-making, 
polishing, etc. Similarly he should shun occupations involving ex- 
posure to wet and sudden changes of temperature, such as those of 
pottery and paper-making, etc. Workers with weak muscles and 
narrow chests should avoid occupations involving stooping in cramped 
positions such as those of tailors, shoemakers, engravers, etc. Those 
having irritable skin should avoid occupations such as those involving 
handling dyestuffs, cement, acids, lime, etc. If the hands perspire 
freely the worker is unfit for such trades as bookbinding, engraving, 
fine leather work, sewing, lace-making, etc. Workmen who have 
syphilis or commencing arteriosclerosis are ill-fitted for employment 
with any of the poisonous metals, particularly lead. Those having 
incipient tuberculosis should, if possible, engage only in outdoor 
occupations of a mild sort which do not involve exposure to inclement 
weather or dust. An ideal occupation for such persons is gardening. 

LEGISLATIVE CONTROL 

The aim of legislative control of the occupational diseases is 
both prohibitive and preventive. The former field is naturally much 
restricted, as it should be ; for it is undesirable and usually unneces- 
sary to interfere seriously with an established industry, unless it 
can be demonstrated convincingly that such industry constitutes both 
a constant and serious menace to life. In this country the only 
actually prohibitive legislation thus far enacted is the recent (1911) 
Congressional action in placing a prohibitive revenue tax upon the 
white phosphorus match industry, which is described under that head. 
In many foreign countries, in addition to a similar prohibition, the 
use of white lead paint has been forbidden in certain industries, the 
non-poisonous zinc being substituted for lead. Thus far these are 
the principal illustrations of positively prohibitive legislation, but 
the list is likely to be somewhat further extended in a few more in- 
stances. For example, the use of wood alcohol in solutions of shel- 



136 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

lac might well be forbidden in confined spaces, where inhalation of 
its fumes may cause death. 

Preventive legislation, on the other hand, already covers a very 
wide field, and in this country twenty-eight States thus far have 
placed various preventive laws upon their statute books, designed 
to protect the health and well-being of the workman, upon the theory 
that industrial disease is really a more or less easily preventable 
accident, and as such may be entitled to compensation. There is, 
as yet, however, no uniformity of inspection of industries in the 
several States, although thirty-three of them have Factory Inspection 
Bureaus. Nor is there any uniformity as to penalties imposed for 
infringement of the laws, or, in fact, as to the regulations formulated. 
In general such penalties, chiefly imposed as fines, vary from $10 to 
$500, but the means for enforcing them are often inadequate. To 
illustrate, in ten States only are there regulations concerning the 
great hazard of dust from emery grinding, and in half of these the 
protective appliances are specified, whereas in the remaining half 
they are left entirely to the discretion and suggestion of inspectors. 
In some States the factory inspection bureau takes direct action in 
these matters, whereas in others the State labor bureau is the instru- 
ment of execution of the laws, and in a few instances the State 
health department (as, for example, in the control of bakeries). In 
twenty-one States the control of the health of miners is relegated to 
a separate bureau of mines. This lack of uniformity presents 
many disadvantages which will doubtless be rectified in time, but the 
subject at best is exceedingly complex and difficult to deal with, and 
it is most undesirable to enact hasty legislation which often does 
more harm than good. Dr. Alice Hamilton, in her intensive study 
of lead poisoning for the State Commission of Illinois, found, curi- 
ously, that in some of the best appointed smelting works the cases 
of lead poisoning were frequent and severe, presumably because the 
operatives relied too much upon being taken care of and took less 
care of themselves than in other places where conditions were notori- 
ously bad. 

The difficulty with all controlling legislation is to adapt it intelli- 
gently to the constantly varying needs of rapidly growing establish- 



PROPHYLAXIS 137 

ments. An ideal plan would be to leave details entirely to the dis- 
cretion and authority of inspectors, but this presupposes that they 
have been especially trained for their work (which is often not the 
case), and are always impartial and above suspicion of connivance 
with employers. Moreover, such a system involves great expense. 
On the other hand, a law which is just and efficient to-day may be 
useless in a year, owing to new protective inventions or changes in 
methods of manufacture. For example, in the case of emery- 
grinding, a law may compel the use of protective exhaust ducts to 
convey away injurious dusts, but such ducts may be placed above 
the grinding wheel when they should be below, or it may be neces- 
sary temporarily to move the grinding wheel into another workroom 
where there are no ducts, and an elaborate system of local ventila- 
tion becomes at once a useless expense. Yet if the law be not 
specific in detail, someone with discretion and authority should be 
empowered to supply the deficiency. To cite one more example: 
As a general proposition, the dust of dry paint which is sand- 
papered or scraped is most injurious. If it be required to moisten 
the dust, the moisture itself may become a hazard to the workman 
by rendering the atmosphere too damp or by escaping through walls 
and floors to other rooms, or it may injure machinery or goods in 
process of manufacture, or may interfere with the subsequent appli- 
cation of paint. Moreover, the great majority of all cases of lead 
poisoning arise among painters who work not collectively in shops, 
but as individuals in dwellings and elsewhere. To reach such con- 
ditions by any form of preventive legislation is extremely difficult, 
if not impossible. In such cases much more is to be hoped for from 
a campaign of education as to the special hazard than by laws which 
manifestly cannot be adequately applied. Two things might be 
done by legislation, however, in this case, either to compel the sub- 
stitution of zinc for lead in the paint or compel the marking of each 
paint receptacle with a label setting forth briefly and distinctly the 
nature of the hazards involved.- 

Much controlling legislation has been enacted in various States as 
above mentioned, and an interesting summary of it has been col- 
lected by Dr. John B. Andrews and published in the American 



138 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

Labor Legislation Review of June, 1911. This legislation com- 
prises regulation, partial or complete, of such conditions as the fol- 
lowing: The production of excessive heat, moisture, steam, vapors, 
fumes, gases, dust, odors and light; the daily dusting and sweeping 
or mopping of rooms; proper receptacles for dust; the wetting of 
dust in some cases; the removal of dust by aspirating ducts 
(Fig. 4, page 42) ; furnishing dry stands for the feet of those who 
work on wet floors ; washing of walls and ceilings with disinfectants 
where animal substances are liable to decomposition; or washing 
walls and ceilings with lime; the making of flooring of cement, 
asphalt, etc., in certain industries; the construction of workrooms 
with a minimum amount of rough surfaces liable to collect dirt ; 
the screening of vapors and dusts; the protection from gases and 
fumes by means of hoods, exhausts and blowers (Fig. 5, page 85) ; 
the proper arrangement and size of air inlets and outlets for 
general ventilation, and the volume of air to be supplied ; the num- 
ber of cubic feet of air space allowed per occupant to the work- 
room (not less than 600 cubic feet) ; the proper proportion of out- 
side window and door area) which should be not less than one-eighth 
of the floor area) ; the protection from excessive light, in some cases 
by colored or corrugated glass, the wearing of colored goggles, etc. ; 
the removal of electric lights when so placed as to injure the eyes, 
the use of respiration masks and inhalers, sponge shields, etc. ; the 
abolition of basement or sub-basement workrooms. 

In addition, for the general welfare of the workman there are 
laws requiring in many cases a full hour for the. noon rest, to give 
time for washing before eating, etc. ; forbidding the carrying of 
food into the workroom; the provision of adequate lunchrooms, of 
separate lockers for clothing and overalls ; the furnishing of adequate 
washbasins (at least one for every thirty employees) (Fig. 6, 
page 86), of soft soap, towels, and running hot and cold water; a 
half -hour's rest interval before beginning overtime work; adequate 
cuspidors and waterclosets. In some cases seats or rests for the 
employees while at work are required. No food is allowed to be 
eaten where gases, fumes or dusts accumulate, and in some instances 
emergency medicine chests are required to be kept in readiness. 



PROPHYLAXIS 139 

As will be seen from the above list, many of these laws are of 
general application for almost every industry, and in their enforce- 
ment attempts are made to secure the interest and cooperation of 
employer and employee alike, which in many instances is forth- 
coming, especially as most of the regulations either involve little 
expense or so far promote efficiency as readily to demonstrate their 
expediency. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to give a detailed ^account of 
the multitudinous laws already enacted in many States for the pro- 
tection of the industrial laborer from disease, laws which regulate 
hours of labor, prohibition of working in certain industries by 
women and children, prohibition of the working of pregnant women 
in factories within two weeks of expected confinement (and in Massa- 
chusetts and in New York for two weeks after confinement), and 
laws regulating many general and special hygienic conditions. 

Unfortunately the scope of these laws in many cases far exceeds 
the provision made for their enforcement, which requires a large 
corps of inspectors and often involves difficulty or delay in imposing 
penalties for infringement. Following are some of the more im- 
portant provisions of such laws as they exist in New York State, 
which may be taken as a fair sample of the type of evils which are 
under legislative regulation in other States. Child labor and the 
labor of boys and girls from 16 to 21 years of age are carefully regu- 
lated. Many occupations are prohibited to minors altogether, and 
children under 16 years are prohibited from working before 8 A. M. 
and after 5 p. M., and for more than 6 days a week. Women may 
not work in factories more than 54 hours a week or 9 hours a day, 
except under special provisions. Among the occupations prohibited 
for women and minors are those of machine-picking of wool, cotton 
or other upholstery materials, burnishing leather, metal-stamping 
machines, washing, grinding or mixing machinery. No girl under 
16 is allowed to work constantly standing. 

Sixty minutes is the required time for the industrial lunch 
hour, except under special provisions. Sanitary laws control the 
amount of air space per workman in factories, the light, ventilation, 
cleanliness of workrooms, toilets and washrooms, dust removal and 



140 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

dust protection in certain industries, the supply of seats for women, 
of drinking water and individual drinking cups, use of cuspidors, 
painting or limewashing of walls and ceilings, removal of gases, 
vapors and steam, supply of receptacles for waste, number and 
cleanliness of washbasins and waterclosets, protection by hoods of 
grinding and buffing machinery with dust exhaust pipes, separate 
dressing rooms for women, etc. The present number of State fac- 
tory inspectors in New York State to carry out the provisions 
of these laws and similar ones relating to industrial accidents is 
125. 

General legislation designed to prevent certain of the disease 
hazards of workingmen has been enacted thus far in the United 
States as follows: 

Provisions for protection against: (a) injurious dusts, in 
twenty-two States; (b) improper lighting, in twelve States; (c) 
poisonous gases, fumes and vapors, in fifteen States; (d) excessive 
temperature and humidity, in eleven States. 

In Germany, England and Switzerland the workmen's compen- 
sation laws include provisions for illness resulting from a number 
of hazardous trades, with pay amounting to 50 to 80 per cent, of the 
regular wage, which is continued during disability. Similar legis- 
lation for this country is at present being actively advocated, and 
the Kern-Wilson Congressional bill introduced in February, 1913, 
contemplates provision for the 350,000 federal employees for cer- 
tain occupational diseases, such as lead poisoning. 

Under the English workmen's Compensation Act the following 
cases were decided by the House of Lords to come within the scope 
of the Act: 

(1) A stoker in a weak and emaciated condition received a 
heat stroke while raking ashes from beneath the boiler in a steam- 
ship, from the effect of which he died. 

(2) A workman having an aneurysm strained himself while 
tightening a nut by a spanner, so that he fell dead from rupture of 
the aneurysm. In this case it was held that the ordinary work 
comprised a strain which was fatal owing to the diseased condition 
of the workman's aorta. 



TREATMENT 141 

(3) A workman acquired a hernia while employed in turning 
the wheel of a machine. 

(4) A workman sorting wool in a factory acquired anthrax 
through infection of the eye and died. 

Cases have also been decided in favor of the workman where, 
owing to the state of his health, he has met with ana accident while 
engaged in his work which he might have avoided in normal health. 
For example, such decision was rendered for a workman who had an 
epileptic fit while standing at his work at the hold of a vessel, into 
which he fell. 

Quite recently the problem of deciding upon preventive meas- 
ures and their enforcement under State laws has been met by the 
establishment of state commissions or boards to which such author- 
ity is delegated. This has been done in Wisconsin and New York. 
Thus far the system appears to offer satisfactory solution of some 
of the difficulties encountered in securing satisfactory prevention of 
disease hazards in certain industries, particularly in factory ventila- 
tion, dust control, cleanliness, etc. 

II. TREATMENT 

The following section deals with the treatment in detail of the 
more important diseases which the workman is liable to acquire 
through the risks of his occupation. As many different forms of 
irritation may give rise to the same diseases, and, therefore, require 
the same treatment, the latter is summarized here to prevent repeti- 
tion. The less common ailments will be dealt with in connection 
with description of the hazards which produce them. 

HEART DISEASES 

The conditions of the heart which are brought about by occupa- 
tion are mainly as follows : 

(1) Tachycardia, from fatigue or toxic agents inhaled or other- 
wise entering the system ; 

(2) Bradycardia, from toxic agents; 



142 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

(3) Cardiac syncope, from acute or chronic poisons ; 

(4) Cardiac hypertrophy, accompanying arteriosclerosis and 
resulting from long-continued physical strain, as in heavy lifting, or 
from toxic agents, particularly the metals, such as lead ; 

(5) In addition many persons having valvular heart disease 
or myocarditis independent of occupation are obliged to continue 
working, and the nature of their work may be such as greatly to 
augment the cardiac lesion. 

Tachycardia. The treatment of tachycardia of the type under 
discussion is by means of rest and such remedies as the bromids and 
tincture of belladonna. If necessary, codein (gr. ^) may be given 
for a short time, or, rf arterial tension is high, chloral hydrate 
(gr. v, 4 times a day) is preferable. If the patient can wear an 
ice bag over the heart, it is somewhat quieting. The bowels should 
be well evacuated, and it is important to determine that flatulent 
dyspepsia with a distended stomach crowding the heart is not re- 
sponsible for much of the trouble. 

Bradycardia. Bradycardia demands elimination of the poison 
which has caused it, as speedily as possible. To this end an alkaline 
diuretic and cathartic should be given, and the patient should also 
be given strychnin. 

Cardiac Syncope. Cardiac syncope from poisoning demands ac- 
tive hypodermatic stimulation with such remedies as ether, camphor 
in oil, strychnin, citrated caffein (gr. ii) or strophanthin (^ milli- 
gram intravenously). If necessary, artificial respiration should 
be performed in any event, fresh air should be secured. The pa- 
tient's body should be kept warm with hot water bottles and blankets 
and a hot poultice of flaxseed meal may be placed over the heart. 
Black coffee and whiskey may be given by rectum if the victim can- 
not swallow ; if able to swallow, all fluids should be given hot. 

Cardiac Hypertrophy. The treatment of cardiac hypertrophy is 
essentially that of arteriosclerosis, detailed on page 32. 

Existing Cardiac Lesions. Existing cardiac lesions, not occupa- 
tional in origin, but made worse by overwork and strain of every 
kind, are very common. So many such cases are met with in my 
clinic that it has been found desirable to furnish the patients with 



TREATMENT 143 

the following printed rules, formulated by Dr. W. H. Sheldon. 
They have proved so serviceable that they are given in full herewith : 



DIRECTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH HEART DISEASE 

Remember, with good care and by obeying instructions, you may live many 
years with little discomfort. 

Instructions 

1. Hurry, worry, hard work, drinking too much liquor of any kind, or 
beer, will shorten your life. 

2. Get wofk where you never have to lift or strain, such as tailoring, 
operating machines. 

3. Live on the gro.und or first floor, as climbing stairs is very harmful. 

4. Never hurry. Do everything slowly. Don't run or walk fast. If you 
get short of breath, or feel dizzy or faint, stop and rest. Don't walk against 
a strong wind, or when it is very cold. 

5. Never indulge in sexual intercourse oftener than once a month. 

6. Rest all you can; lie down as much as possible. Have at least eight 
hours' sleep every night. 

7. Be sure to get plenty of fresh air. Keep your windows open at 
night. 

8. Wear flannels the year round, warmer in winter. 

9. Avoid getting your feet wet. 

10. See that you have one free passage of the bowels every morning, 
and never strain at stool. 

11. Indigestion is very bad for persons with heart disease, as it is a 
strain on the heart. So eat very slowly, and chew your food well. Rest after 
meals. Do not eat so much that you gain weight. 

12. Diet. 

Meat. Boiled, broiled, or roasted meat once a day. 

Dairy Products. Milk, cream, and butter in moderation. 

Cereals. Rice, hominy, Indian meal, barley, cracked wheat, oatmeal, 

cream of wheat, etc. 

Bread, at least a day old. Whole wheat, rye, Graham, corn bread. 
Eggs. Cooked in any way except fried. 
Vegetables. Potatoes, in small quantities, beets, carrots, squash, 

lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, peas. 
Avoid. Canned, salted, or fried meats. 

It is better to eat small meals frequently than too much at one time. 
Do not drink much water or fluid of any kind at one time, it overloads 
the stomach and strains the heart. 

Drink water several times between meals, not with meals, and do not 
take more than a tumblerful at one time. 



144 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



ASPHYXIA 

Asphyxia results from irritation of a great variety of toxic gases, 
vapors and fumes, from the inhalation of smoke in burning buildings, 
from powder smoke of explosions, and sudden overwhelming of the 
respiratory system with dusts such as cement, dust of grains in 
milling, etc., where some accident has made the air irrespirable and 
choked the lungs. It results also from edema of the glottis due to 
inhalation of acid fumes, ammonia, etc. The victim becomes un- 
conscious, deeply cyanosed, pulseless, and respiration* ceases. The 
pupils are dilated. Prompt action becomes necessary to save life. 

The patient should be laid flat, the clothing loosened about the 
neck and chest, and the angle of the lower jaw raised upward and 
forward, while the tongue should be kept from falling backward 
and thus blocking the posterior pharynx and cutting off possible 
entrance of air. A ready way to accomplish this is to force and 
hold the mouth open with a blunt stick and then pass a stout thread 
through the anterior part of the tongue with a sharp needle. The 
tongue is then drawn forward and kept well out of the mouth by 
tying the thread around the patient's ear, while the mouth gag pre- 
vents the tongue from being bitten. Artificial respiration should be 
performed by kneeling behind the victim's head and raising his arms 
to fullest extension above his head. His arms are then brought 
down parallel to his chest and pressed against it to expel the air. An 
assistant should simultaneously compress the lower part of the pa- 
tient's thorax to aid in expelling air. These motions should be 
rhythmically repeated not oftener than fourteen times a minute, or 
somewhat slower than the normal rate of breathing. A brief pause 
should occasionally be made to see whether the respiratory act may 
not be normally resumed of itself. Further stimulation of respira- 
tion may be made by flipping the thorax vigorously with a towel 
wet in ice water and by passing ammonia before the nostrils. In 
many patients a coat rolled up and placed between the shoulders will 
throw the chest forward and facilitate the artificial respiration. If 
much mucus accumulates in the mouth it should be swabbed out. 



TREATMENT 



145 



Hypodennactic stimulation with ether, camphor in oil and strychnin 
should be given in all cases with much mucus. Atropin sulphate 
(gr. 1/100) should also be given. The attempts at inducing respira- 
tion should not be abandoned for fully half an hour, for remarkable 
cases of resuscitation have 
occurred long after the vic- 
tim was apparently dead. 

As a substitute for arti- 
ficial respiration by hand, 
the "pulmotor" may be used 
to advantage, and in many 
places where accidents from 
asphyxia are to be antici- 
pated, as in coal mines, 
powder and fulminate 
works, etc., this apparatus 
should be kept ready for in- 
stant use. The pulmotor is 
a patented form of rescue 
apparatus designed to per- 
form artificial inflation of 
the lungs in cases of suffo- 
cation from smoke, cessa- 
tion of breathing due to irri- 
tant cardiac or respiratory 
poisons, threatened edema 
of the lungs, etc. It is very 

useful as an emergency ap- FIG. 22. RESCUE APPARATUS, COMPLETE

workmen are liable to be overcome suddenly by irrespirable fumes 
or gases. It is much used in the rescue department of coal mines. 
I have used it several times in acute pulmonary edema with marked 
benefit. Seven firemen who had been overcome by smoke from sul- 
phur and pitch used for insulating wires were recently revived by 




GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 



it at the Homeopathic Hospital in New York City, some of them 
several minutes after they were apparently dead from suffocation. 

The apparatus consists of a 
small tank of compressed oxygen 
and a motor, together with a bel- 
lows, springs, valves and an injec- 
tor. A mixture of air and oxygen 
is pumped into the lungs automati- 
cally on opening the valves and 
starting the motor. When the 
lungs are distended to their full 
normal capacity the pressure with- 
in them reverses the motor, which 
automatically sucks the air out 
again. The apparatus then pumps 
air in again, again reverses, 
and so on, continuing to operate 
rhythmically at the ordinary rate 
of respiration until all the oxygen 
is exhausted. A .flexible mask of 
rubber is strapped over the pa- 
tient's nose and mouth, which is 
connected by rubber tubing with 
the rest of the apparatus. 

In order to accomplish the res- 
cue of asphyxiated persons from 
irrespirable atmospheres which 
might asphyxiate the rescuer, tke 
oxygen or "smoke helmet" is used. 
This helmet is designed for rescue 
work in mines, smoke-filled build- 
ings at fires, after explosions in chemical works, boiler rooms, etc. 
It is in use by the Rescue Corps of the Federal Bureau of Mines 
and by the United States Navy Department in case of submarine 
accidents, leakage or explosions from gas fuel tanks, bunker fires or 
powder explosions in turrets and magazines. The apparatus, shown 




FIG. 23. OXYGEN HELMET. Front 
view, showing breathing bag and 
flexible hose connecting with the 
oxygen supply and apparatus 
carried on the back. 




TREATMENT 



147 



in Figures 22 and 23, consists of a tank of compressed oxygen with 
pressure gauge and valves, carried on the back and connected with 
the interior of a tight-fitting helmet mask. It may be worn for half 
an hour or more, and renders the wearer completely independent of 
any deleterious gases in the surrounding atmosphere. 




FIG. 24. OXYGEN INHALER. Compressed oxygen or air passes through the 
tubing in a strong current which is directed by the mouthpiece past the 
nostrils. 

Another means of supplying oxygen to the rescuer or to firemen 
entering a smoke or fume-charged room consists of a curved plate 
which is held in the mouth so as to direct a stream of oxygen or 
compressed air in a strong draught upward past the nostrils and eyes, 
thus blowing away the smoke and supplying fit air to breathe simul- 
taneously. (Fig. 24.) The oxygen tank is carried by a second per- 
son at a distance, or may be worn on the back of the operator, and a 



148 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

simple hose with a valve conducts the oxygen to the mouthpiece. 
This apparatus is obviously less effective than the oxygen helmet, 
but has the advantage of being cheaper and less complicated. It is 
useful where the danger from asphyxia is less imminent and where 
only short exposure is required. 

ACUTE RHINITIS 

This condition, very common among occupational diseases from 
inhaling irritant dusts, gases, fumes, vapors, smoke, etc., is best 
treated by a warm nasal douche of normal salt solution, followed by 
topical application of adrenalin chlorid and menthol. Internally a 
rhinitis tablet should be given every hour or two for a few doses, and 
a saline cathartic. The nose, after irrigation, should be protected 
from further irritation by smearing liquid vaselin within the nares. 
The nasal douching or irrigation is particularly important at the 
onset in cases of occupational origin, because there is apt to be con- 
siderable irritant material clogging the nostrils. 

CHRONIC RHINITIS 

In chronic atrophic rhinitis the offensive dry crusts should be 
loosened and removed by a gentle nasal douche of warm bicarbonate 
of soda or boric acid (gr. x | i), or a weak solution of sodium 
salicylate may be used. This treatment should be followed by a 
protective albolene spray with menthol and eucalyptol. After a few 
days of such treatment, the nose being thoroughly cleansed, a topical 
application may be made of argyrol or 

3^ Tincturae iodi TH, xx

Deep ulcers may be touched with nitrate of silver or aristol. As 
general "tonics," cod liver oil, Fowler's solution, and syrup of the 
iodid of iron are the most serviceable remedies. 



TREATMENT 149 



SINUSITIS 

For sinusitis, the sinuses should be thoroughly washed out with a 
mild alkaline, warm, antiseptic solution, such as 

I Sodii bicarbonatis 

Sodii biboratis aa 3 i 

Listerine fl. 1 i 

Aquae destillatae fl. 1 vi M. 

After cleansing, a 1/5000 adrenalin spray may be introduced. 



ACUTE PHARYNGITIS 

At the onset tincture of aconite may be given in minim doses 
once an hour, and the pharynx should be rinsed with a warm solu- 
tion of sodium bicarbonate 3 ii, glycerin ss> water jv As in 
most of the acute inflammations of the upper air passages, a cathartic, 
such as a dose of calomel, should be prescribed. 

CHRONIC PHARYNGITIS 

This type of inflammation, so common in dusty occupations and 
those involving inhalation of acid fumes, may be treated by swab- 
bing the wall of the pharynx with iodin or argyrol once in two or 
three days, or a spray may be used of sulphate of zinc solution in 
water (gr. x i) or 

^ Sodii boratis 3 i 

Acidi carbolici gr. x 

Tincturse iodi 3 jj

ACUTE LARYNGITIS 

This form of inflammation often results from irritation of toxic 
gases, vapors or fumes. It may be relieved by a gargle, such as :

To be used once in three or four hours. An ice bag should be 
applied externally and a cathartic given. 

Should there be much pain on swallowing, a spray which gives 
great relief consists of 

3^ lodof ormi gr. iv 

Etheris j v 

This may be used briefly three or four times a day while the 
patient inspires deeply. 

ACUTE BRONCHITIS 

In the initial stage of acute bronchitis, when the bronchial mucous 
membrane is dry, tincture of aconite ( it[ \ ) may be given with 
liquor ammoniae acetatis (fl. 3 ii) and camphor water ( 3 j). A cathar- 
tic, such as calomel or cascara, should be given. As soon as the 
muco-purulent secretion begins to form these remedies may be re- 
placed with ammonium carbonate or chlorid or the common alkaline 
diuretic mixture, consisting of the acetate, bicarbonate and citrate of 
potassium. 

Meanwhile the patient may use a spray of creosote -nixx i n 
listerine and distilled water iii, inhaling it deeply. A mustard 
paste, made large and weak (1 8), gives considerable relief when 
applied over the upper sternal region or between the shoulders. The 
diet may be semi-solid. 

CHRONIC BRONCHITIS 

This ailment is one of the commonest among all those who are 
exposed to constant bronchial irritation or extremes of temperature 



TREATMENT 151 

and dampness in their work. It is very difficult to cure while un- 
favorable conditions surround the workman, and often a change of 
occupation is essential to secure relief. It is a great mistake to 
give too much medicine, which may only destroy the appetite and 
digestion or cause depression. Drugs like heroin not only are de- 
pressant, but easily induce a permanent drug habit. If the cough 
is persistent and severe, causing muscular pains in the chest and 
interfering with sleep, the mistura glycyrrhizse composites ( 3 i) with 
ammonium chlorid (gr. ii), or carbonate (gr. v), may be given 
three or four times a day and once or twice in the night. Or, if 
there is much pain or muscular soreness, codeiii may be given in the 
following mixture : 

^ Codein gr. iv 

Syrupi tolutani 

Aquae aafl. 1 ii 

. Misce. : Sig. : dose 3 i gr. 3 hrs. 

But, as stated, the patient should be given as little as possible of 
remedies of this class. Should bronchorrhea characterize the con- 
dition, the watery secretion may be checked by tincture of bella- 
donna (iTl,iv), given two or three times a day. 

In many cases of chronic bronchitis the best results are obtained 
by the use of inhalations. Usually unable to use them during his 
working hours, the workman may do so, however, when he goes to 
his home in the evening, again on retiring and on rising. A pint of 
boiling water in a tea-kettle may be medicated and the steam inhaled 
through a paper funnel fitted over the spout. To the water should 
be added five drops of a mixture of pinol and eucalyptol, or ^ x 
of compound tincture of benzoin. The mistake is often made of 
using these remedies too strong, when they are irritating and nau- 
seous. Properly used, they almost always afford marked relief. 

It is customary in obstinate chronic cases, especially in those 
having arteriosclerosis as an important feature, to prescribe potas- 
sium iodid, and it sometimes gives relief, especially in elderly per- 
sons. Two or three grains per dose are better than larger quantities. 
Creosote carbonate or guaiacol combined with some simple syrupy 



152 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

substance such as glycerin with a flavoring extract, or the syrupus 
pruni Virginianse may be taken, and in some cases the patient may 
wear a nose inhaler saturated with four or five drops of creosote. 
A simple inhaler for this purpose which I have long used was de- 
signed by Beverley Robinson. It is made out of a piece of per- 
forated zinc, such as is used for seives, bent to the form of a trun- 
cated cone, and the edges, after being trimmed to fit closely to the 
sides of the nose, are protected by binding with tape. A fragment 
of sponge is sewn in the apex of the cone to hold whatever medica- 
ments, are used. The cone should be deep enough to prevent the 
creosote from actual contact with the skin. I have several times 
seen serious eschars of the tip of the nose from carelessness in this 
matter. 

Unfortunately, many patients will not wear inhalers or even 
take medicines during working hours, partly from the extra trouble 
and partly from the desire not to draw attention to their ailments 
from fear of being accused of "faking" or of losing their job. This 
is all the more true of late years, since every workman has been 
taught that tuberculosis is "catching," and he dreads to emphasize 
in any manner the fact that he has a cough. 

Further treatment of chronic bronchitis consists in maintaining 
regularity of the bowels through the daily morning use of salines 
such as sodium phosphate or Rochelle salts, and taking a wholesome, 
nourishing diet, in which fats or oils predominate, such as butter, 
eggs and bacon, and olive or cod liver oil. In general, the patient 
does best without strong liquors of any sort, but in some cases malt 
liquors beer, ale or stout may be allowed. One must be guided 
in this matter by the patient's previous racial and personal habits. 
Counterirritation of the chest is always a useful adjunct to other 
measures. The chest may be rubbed with equal parts of turpentine 
and vaselin, or with mustard liniment 

FETID BRONCHITIS, PULMONARY ABSCESS AND GANGRENE 

These conditions require the same general treatment and differ 
only in that, in exceptional cases, an abscess cavity may have to be 



TEEATMENT 153 

opened and drained where it is not already draining sufficiently 
through a bronchus, or where a large cavity is held by adhesions 
and cannot contract satisfactorily. 

It is a first requisite that the patient be removed from his work, 
if, indeed, he is not already quite incapacitated. What he most 
needs is rest and air free from the deleterious irritants which have 
been the primary cause of the trouble. Nothing so well controls 
the fever, in my experience, as a constant inhalation of steam vapor 
impregnated with turpentine (TFI xxx Oi). This should be sup- 
plied through a croup kettle set on the floor, and the vapor directed 
under a tent over the patient's head, but with .due regard to access of 
fresh air. A good rule is to give the inhalation for two hours, place 
the patient in fresh outdoor air for four hours, and repeat. 

Creosote may be given internally in capsule ( m ii, t. i. d.) or 
emulsion. 

Everything should be done to maintain the patient's nutrition, 
and between meals he should take diluted cream, beaten eggs, cus- 
tards, etc. As general tonics he may be given syrup of the iodicl 
of iron or Fowler's solution and mix vomica. 

ASTHMA AND EMPHYSEMA 

True spasmodic asthma, due to inhalation of dust fumes, smoke 
and other respiratory irritants, is so common as to be known by 
workmen under various occupational titles, such as "miner's," "pot- 
ter's," "miller's" asthma, and the like. 

Treatment consists of giving a hypodermatic injection of TTlx 
of a 1 :1000 solution of adrenalin chlorid, applying a large mus- 
tard paste (1:4) to the surface of the chest between the shoulders, 
giving a large cup of strong black coffee and an active purge, such as 
calomel (gr. iii) or blue mass (gr. x). As accessory measures a hot 
mustard foot-bath may be given and a stramonium cigarette may be 
inhaled. Between the attacks a tonic and tincture of belladonna 
may be given, and digestion should be well looked after to pre- 
vent dyspepsia, especially of flatulent type. For the latter, di- 
lute hydrochloric acid ( TTJ,XX) and tincture of nux vomica (TH.X) 



154 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

should be prescribed, with a laxative pill at night. The patient 
should eat very little meat, becoming practically a vegetarian, and 
should drink water freely. 

Many cases of asthma of occupational origin are almost impos- 
sible to benefit while the patient remains at work in the irritating 
atmosphere which has provoked the disease, and he should be urged 
strongly to undertake some other employment. 

Emphysema may be acquired by glass blowers, workmen such 
as jewelers, who make constant use of the blowpipe, et al., although 
it is more often the outcome of chronic asthma with arteriosclerosis. 
It gives rise to dyspnea and in advanced cases to chronic cyanosis. 
The symptoms are always much accentuated by attacks of bronchitis 
and asthma, and treatment consists in following the directions for 
these two conditions and seeking as far as possible to prevent such 
attacks by avoiding exposure to cold and wet, sudden changes of tem- 
perature, and attacks of dyspepsia. It is important also to keep 
arterial pressure from rising. (See Arteriosclerosis, page 42.) 
Potassium iodid (gr. iii t. i. d.) is often used for this condition, 
but I am not convinced that it proves of much value. It often dis- 
orders the stomach, and dyspepsia may precipitate asthmatic attacks 
and make matters worse. 

EDEMA OF THE LUNGS 

Pulmonary edema of occupational origin is produced by sud- 
den overwhelming inhalation of toxic fumes, especially those of 
nitrous gases, etc. The condition is urgent and unless immediately 
relieved promptly ends in death. The respiration is labored and 
stertorous. The victim presents every evidence of intense air hun- 
ger. He is anxious, restless, and gasping for breath. Cyanosis 
is intense, the eyes are prominent, the pulse is quick and feeble, the 
skin is bathed in cold perspiration. Mucus rattles in the throat, and 
respiratory fremitus may be palpated all over the chest. Loud, 
coarse gurgling rales are everywhere heard, obscuring the heart 
sounds. The temperature may be subnormal. 

The chest should be cupped energetically with dry cups, and 



TREATMENT 155 

atropin (gr. 1/100) should be given hypodermically, together with 
ether, camphor in oil or citrated caffein (gr. ii). An enema of 
strong black coffee ( pint) should be given. As there is tendency 
to relapse, the patient should be watched carefully for some hours. 
It may be necessary to employ artificial respiration. In several cases 
I have obtained marked benefit by use of the pulmotor. (See 
page 145.) 

The subject of pulmonary edema is further discussed under Acid 
Poisoning. 

GASTRIC DYSPEPSIA 

This ailment in various types, but usually with flatulency, is 
very common as an occupational disorder. It arises from many 
causes, chief among which are foul air in the workroom, hurried 
habits of eating, worry over "speeding up," etc., and poor food or 
poorly cooked food. It is usually accompanied by constipation and 
a torpid liver due to lack of exercise, or cramped position while at 
work contributes to its origin. 

The general rules for eating given on page 129 should be fol- 
lowed, but especially to be avoided are sweets of all kinds, fats and 
fried food, puddings, pastry and pickles. 

For medicinal treatment many patients are greatly benefited or 
cured by taking 3ii of the mistura rhei composita of the Pharma- 
copeia before meals. In other cases, particularly those with exces- 
sive flatulency, the best remedy is n^xx of dilute hydrochloric acid, 
with TTI.X of nux vomica tincture and 3! of compound tincture of 
cardamom given in a wineglassful of hot water directly after eating. 
Slow eating and thorough mastication should be insisted upon and 
the teeth should be put in good order. Cascara sagrada ( fi[ xxx 
of the fluid extract) should be given at night, and once a week a 
calomel purge or compound cathartic pill should be given. The use 
of alcoholic beverages in any form is undesirable. Exercise should 
be regulated. A postman may walk too much and a shoemaker too 
little. In the one case the dyspepsia is due to fatigue and inhibition 
of gastric secretion ; in the other it is due to inactivity of the liver, 
and in each case appropriate directions should be given. If the 



156 GENEKAL KEMEDIAL MEASUKES 

patient has not time or energy to walk, he may take needed exer- 
cise at home with Indian clubs or some other simple expedient, 
like the "setting up drill," performed for ten minutes twice a day. 



CONSTIPATION 

Constipation is one of the commonest ailments among the work- 
ing classes, especially among those who, like motormen or engineers, 
are obliged to have long and often irregular hours of work, or those, 
like garment workers, whose occupation is sedentary. This is a 
matter requiring strict attention by women and girls especially, whose 
sedentary work or irregularity of working hours is very likely to 
impair activity of the bowels. Chronic constipation leads to head- 
ache, anemia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhea, gastric dyspepsia and other 
ailments, and, besides impairing health, also impairs efficiency in 
marked degree. 

Constipation is favored by improper diet and lack of sufficient 
supply of good drinking water placed in easily accessible places. 
It is also favored by fatigue and, in some cases, by excessive perspira- 
tion without exercise, which tends to diminish the fluidity of the 
natural digestive secretions. Certain poisons, particularly lead and 
its preparations, possess very constipating properties. 

Constipation should be overcome, if possible, without recourse to 
medicines. For this purpose calisthenic exercises should be prac- 
ticed night and morning; water should be drunk freely, six or eight 
tumblerfuls daily, or more if the nature of the work induces free 
perspiration; and fresh fruits, such as apples and oranges, should 
be taken between meals as on rising and retiring. When thus 
taken with a glass or two of water their laxative effect is enhanced. 
Coarse cereals, such as oatmeal, hominy and Graham bread, should 
be eaten, and fresh green vegetables when obtainable. 

Constipation is such a frequent cause of complaint among the 
working classes who frequent my clinic that the following printed 
instructions are given to all who suffer from it. They were pre- 
pared by my Chief of Dispensary Clinic, Dr. W. H. Sheldon. 



TREATMENT 157 

MEDICAL CLINIC 

CORNELL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL COLLEGE 
OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT 

WHAT TO DO FOR CONSTIPATION 

1. Eat slowly; chew the food well. 

2. Drink plenty of water: a tumblerful before each meal, and one more 
on rising and on going to bed. 

3. Keep a regular time for going to stool each morning. 

4. Exercise in the open air as much as possible. Practice exercises that 
will strengthen the muscles of the abdomen. 

5. Diet. The following foods are especially useful: Apples, oranges, 

pineapple, prunes, figs, dried stewed peaches, cabbage, onions, 
spinach, "greens," tomatoes, rhubarb, butter, olive oil, coarse Gra- 
ham bread, rye bread, oatmeal, wheaten grits. Molasses, honey 
and gingerbread are useful for children. 
Foods to be -avoided because they cause constipation are : Milk, cheese, 

eggs, sweets, pastry, pickles, fried foods and tea. 
It is better to eat fruits, green vegetables and coarse cereals than much 
meat. 

6. It is better to cure constipation by careful dieting than to be always 
taking pills or medicine. 

In the above dietary those foods are recommended which come 
within the purse limits of the average workman. 

Constipation is often promoted by lack of attention to regularity 
in habit. When work begins early on cold, dark winter mornings 
the temptation is to neglect the normal function of the bowels until 
later in the day, and dirty, unhygienic closets in factory or mill 
further tend to make the workmen postpone the function and curtail 
it as much as possible. Hurried eating at a belated breakfast or 
luncheon, for which insufficient time is allowed, contributes to the 
habit, and lack of accessible drinking water in occupations which 
give rise to free perspiration is a common cause of constipation. 

With regard to exercise, it should be remembered that over- 
exercise, as in the necessary overuse of certain muscles in various 
occupations, merely induces fatigue, and thus prevents the patient 
from taking the more wholesome types of exercise which favor 



158 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

peristalsis. In the above rules "exercise in the open air" is recom- 
mended, but in some kinds of work, even in the open air, exercise 
is overdone and rest may be more needed during the non-working 
hours. This direction is intended chiefly for those whose work is 
sedentary and who live so far from their work that they always ride 
to and fro. 

When medicines are needed to supplement the dietary, fluids 
such as fluid extract of cascara, or bitter-water or salts in the 
morning, are better, as a rule, than pills, because the dosage is more 
easily regulated, and the patient may be instructed to lessen the 
quantity of laxative as the effect of proper dieting begins to appear, 
and gradually to give up the use of medicines altogether. 

KIDNEY DISEASES 

The essential occupational renal disease is a chronic interstitial 
nephritis, induced by chronic metal poisoning or poisoning with some 
one of the toxic fluids or other chronic poisons. Acute parenchyma- 
tous nephritis is, however, not rarely met with, as in turpentine 
poisoning, etc. There are also cases of simple hematinuria and of 
acute suppression of urine, as in the caisson disease. The chronic 
nephritis of occupational origin does not differ in any manner from 
that so often accompanying chronic alcoholism and syphilis, and does 
not, therefore, demand detailed description here. The instructions 
for nephritic patients, however, are most important, and I append 
in detail the printed rules which for some time past have been issued 
to patients at my clinic. 

DIRECTIONS FOB PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE 

Remember, with good care and by obeying instructions, you may live 
many years with little discomfort. 

Instructions 
I. To avoid taking cold 

(1) Wear flannel underclothes all the year, warmer in winter. 

(2) Keep the feet dry; wear warm socks. 



TKEATMENT 159 

(3) Do not get wet or chilled. 

(4) Keep in the open air and sunshine all you can. 

(5) Keep your rooms at an even temperature, not too hot. 



II. To relieve the work of the kidneys 

(1) Take a hot sponge bath every night at bedtime to keep open the 
pores of the skin. 

(2) Keep the bowels open. Have at least one good passage every 
morning. 

III. Occupation 

Get work in which you never have to lift or strain, such as tailor- 
ing, operating, etc. It is harmful to lift heavy weights, walk too fast, stoop 
or climb long stairs. Rest as much as possible, with not less than eight 
hours sleep. Do not worry or get too tired. 



IV. Diet 

Dairy foods. Milk, cream, butter and a small amount of cheese. 

Cereals. Rice, hominy, Indian meal, barley, cracked wheat, oatmeal, 
cream of wheat, etc. 

Breads. Whole wheat, Graham, rye, corn bread. 

Vegetables. Potatoes, beets, carrots, onions, turnips, squash, lettuce, 
spinach, tomatoes, peas. 

Fruits. All fresh fruits except bananas. 

Liquids. Drink no alcoholic liquors of any kind, not even beer. They 
are all absolutely poisonous to anyone with kidney disease and are 
likely to cause dropsy, shortness of breath or convulsions, and destroy 
your eyesight, besides shortening your life. Do not drink large 
quantities of water or other liquids. 
Avoid all red meats, and eat eggs only in moderate quantities. 

Avoid all salted or dried or canned meats and vegetables. 

When acute parenchymatous nephritis is met with the patient 
should be put to bed and given a hot pack with a hot lemonade. 
Cups may later be applied over the lumbar region, followed by a hot 
flaxseed poultice. High colonic irrigation with a hot normal salt 
solution should be employed, or the Murphy drip may be used. The 
diet should consist of equal parts of milk and Vichy. 

When strangury occurs in connection with hemoglobinuria or 



160 GENERAL REMEDIAL MEASURES 

otherwise it may be relieved by suppositories of extract of hyoscy- 
anius (gr. i) with codein (gr. ss), given every six hours. A hot 
poultice over the lower abdomen may contribute comfort. It is best, 
not to give morphin, but its use cannot always be avoided. In cases 
in which the arterial tension is very high the patient should be bled 
about sixteen ounces. 



PART III 
DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

I. TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 
ANTIMONY 

In the preparation of antimony products toxic vapors may be 
evolved, as they are, also, in the use of some of these products in 
manufactures, particularly the vapor of the trioxid (Sb 2 O 3 ) and 
antimonious acid. 

The various preparations are used in burnishing rifle barrels and 
steel ware (antimony chlorid), making type and stereotype metal 
alloys, hardening lead for ammunition, making Britannia ware and 
white metal, making fireworks, anilin dyes, vulcanizing and making 
red rubber, for which latter the pentasulphid is used. Antimonial 
preparations are further employed as mordants in cotton dyeing and 
textile printing. Cases of chronic antimony poisoning have been 
observed also among workers in chemical industries and paint- 
makers who are exposed to dust from the antimonial salts. 

Symptoms. The symptoms are both acute and chronic. Locally 
the antimony compounds give rise to dermatitis and pruritus, espe- 
cially where the skin is perspiring. Inhaled as dust and in vapor, 
they cause acute symptoms such as rhinitis, inflammation of the 
pharynx, bronchitis, gastric disorder, and colic, sometimes with 
diarrhea. In serious cases of poisoning there are circulatory dis- 
turbances such as vertigo, palpitation, faintness and feeble heart 
action. Albuminuria is common. 

Strumpf and Zabel, of Strassburg, have shown, both experi- 
mentally with animals and chemically, that much of the chronic 

161 



162 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

poisoning among typesetters is not due to lead, but to antimony. 
Type is often faced with a mixture of lead, 70 to 80 per cent., anti- 
mony 15 to 20 per cent., and tin 5 per cent. As the tin is inert, 
the cause of the poisoning must lie between the two other metals. 
In two patients these experimenters recovered antimony from the 
stools, and a number of typesetters were found to lack important 
symptoms of lead poisoning, such as granular basophilia, leukocytosis, 
albuminuria, biliuria and increased blood pressure. 

The symptoms presented, however, were typical of chronic anti- 
mony poisoning as follows: frontal and occipital headache, vertigo, 
oppression in the chest, peripheral neuralgic and muscular pains, 
gastric disorder, constipation, insomnia, general nervousness, irrita- 
bility , muscular fatigue and sexual weakness. Blood examination 
exhibited only moderate anemia, leukopenia, and an eosinophilia of 
10 to 25 per cent. The urine appeared normal. Recovery usually 
took place upon a milk diet and laxatives, with regulated rest, exer- 
cise and fresh air. 

Prophylaxis and Treatment. Prophylaxis and treatment of anti- 
mony poisoning are practically identical with the measures described 
for Lead Poisoning 1 . 

ARSENIC 

There are thirty or more trades in which arsenic is a menace to 
health in one form or another, as it is employed as a powder, a solu- 
tion and in various compounds. The more important of these indus- 
tries are : mining and smelting arsenical ores, hide curing and tanning 
leather, making paint and colors, making oilcloth, black metal plat- 
ing, fur curing, dyeing fabrics, and glass making. 

An American chemist lately analyzed forty-two samples of furs 
in eleven of which arsenic was present, in some cases to the extent of 
170 grains to the square yard, thus constituting a serious menace 
to the wearer. 

Arsenic contaminates some of the anilin dyes. 

I reported a case of arsenic poisoning with peripheral neuritis in 
a tanner to the New York State Labor Bureau in the early part of 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 



163 



1912, and three other cases of industrial arsenic poisoning were also 
reported in that year. 

Taxidermists employ arsenous oxid in proportion of a pound to 
the gallon of water, as a dipping or spraying protective solution for 
feathers and furs. 

C. T. Graham-Rogers, in the Report of the New York State 
Commissioner of Labor, 1911, writes, "An analysis of a sample of 




FIG. 25. ARSENIC POISONING. An old and dangerous method of putting 
Paris green into a bolter. The workman wears a cloth protector, but much 
dust flies in his face, and he is without gloves. There are no ventilators 
and the unprotected belting is a distributor of dust. (From the Ameri- 
can Labor Legislation Review, vol. ii, no. 2, June, 1912.) 

dust secured in a room where Paris green was boxed showed .303 
gram per cubic meter of air, and further analysis showed that of this 
.093 gram was arsenic. This dust is not only poisonous, but very irri- 
tating, and, as a result of spending several days at the plant, the 
mucous membrane of my nose, as well as that of Inspector Vogt, was 
inflamed for some days after our visit." (Figs. 25, 26.) 

Many pigments are made with arsenical compounds, but the most 
familiar are Scheele's green or copper arsenite and Schweinfurth or 



164 



DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



Paris green, which is an aceto-arsenite of copper. White arsenic 
or arsenous oxid is the preparation used by furriers and taxidermists 
to preserve skins from decay and moths. It is also used in shot- 
making and several other industries. 

Arsenic was formerly employed in the manufacture of wall 
papers, colored paper boxes and cards, artificial flowers and leaves, 




FIG. 26. ARSENIC POISONING. Putting Paris green into a comparatively 
dustless bolter. Two types of respirators are shown, with protecting gloves, 
caps and overalls fitting close around the neck and wrists. (From the 
American Labor Legislation Review, vol. ii, no. 2, June, 1912.) 

especially to form green pigments ; and arsenical powders, especially 
Paris green, were dusted over the surface from a perforated box like 
a muffineer. Poisoning by such a very hazardous method was quite 
common. The introduction of anilins and other pigments has al- 
most entirely replaced the use of arsenic in these industries. 

In making artificial flowers the leaves are stiffened with paraffin 
or some similar preparation, and are then sometimes powdered with 
fine metallic dust such as that of aluminum or steel, instead of 
arsenical pigments. 

M. A. Starr has reported a case of well-marked arsenical poison- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 165 

M 
ing in a pregnant woman who was obliged to spend three months in 

bed. The room was papered and upholstered with green fabrics 
from which arsenic was derived on analysis. 

In the dyeing of rugs and carpets in the United States both 
chrome and arsenical pigments, which were formerly much in vogue, 
have been almost entirely superseded by other dyes, such as the 
anilins. Moreover, much of the dyeing process which was con- 
ducted originally by hand is now accomplished by machinery. In 
Massachusetts a law was passed several years ago compelling a 
guarantee that no arsenical pigment was used in the dyeing of rugs 
made within the jurisdiction of the State. 

There have been cases of arsenical poisoning among makers of 
insecticides used by farmers for dipping sheep to kill ticks. In 
many plant industries Paris green is employed as an insecticide on 
a very large scale, and arsenical poisoning may result from careless 
handling of it. This poison is spread over the leaves of the cotton 
plant to kill the army worm, and where several thousand acres form 
a single plantation large quantities of it are distributed. 

Cases of arsenical poisoning were not infrequent among the 
negro plantation men when the old method was used. A negro rode 
a mule between the rows of cotton plants, holding in his hands a 
cross stick, from the ends of which cloth bags filled with the poison 
were suspended so as to shake out the powdered dust upon the plants. 
The modern method, under which arsenic poisoning now rarely, if 
ever, occurs was invented by Mr. Albert R. Shattuck. It consists 
of a portable blower, rotated by hand, by which the Paris green is 
blown by compressed air. The cloud of dust, sent with the air, 
rises to a height of ten or fifteen feet and is carried far away from 
the laborer, to fall upon the plants. 

About forty persons were recently poisoned at a wedding by 
eating a lettuce salad, the lettuce having been sprayed with Paris 
green by a careless, gardener. Arsenate of lead is used as a plant 
insecticide both dry and as a paste. 

Orpiment is a yellow sulphid of arsenic which, among other 
uses, is added sometimes to adulterate the poorer grades of shellac 
to make them yellow and opaque. Such shellac is used in varnish- 



166 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

9k 

ing brewery vats and casks, and has been found as an adulterant of 
candy, being added to give it attractive gloss. Handling it is not 
known to have caused serious poisoning, but taking it in food or drink 
may do so, and in England a number of cases of arsenical poisoning 
acquired from beer drinking were reported a few years ago. Shel- 
lac itself is non-toxic, being a resin-like material secreted by a scale- 
forming insect in the East Indies. In the beer cases above referred 
to, however, the arsenic was found to be derived from a process of 
manufacture of glucose which was used in fermenting the beer. The 
symptoms produced were those of peripheral neuritis. 

Pathological Anatomy. In fatal cases of chronic arsenic poison- 
ing Professor Ekeley of the University of Colorado has shown that 
most of the arsenic is retained in the liver and kidneys, with traces 
in the brain, as Russell H. Chittenden long ago pointed out. In 
acute cases, due to fume poisoning, there may be commencing fatty 
degeneration of the liver and kidneys, with ulcers of the stomach 
and intestines and bronchopneumonia. 

Symptoms of Acute Poisoning. Inhalation of arsenical fumes in 
moderate concentration occasions irritation of the eyes, headache, 
nausea, vomiting, intestinal cramps, anemia, and jaundice. In time 
peripheral nerve and joint pains are complained of and nutrition is 
impaired. 

In more serious cases resulting from stronger fumes the pulse 
becomes quick and feeble, vomiting occurs, there is. a cold perspira- 
tion with cyanosis, drowsiness, and there is frequent micturition with 
hemoglobinuria. The patient may die from paralysis of the heart 
or with- symptoms resembling cholera. 

Symptoms of Chronic Arsenic Poisoning. Primarily there is gas- 
tro-intestinal disorder. Nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, intestinal 
unrest and sometimes diarrhea prevail. Nutrition is impaired, mus- 
cular strength weakens, and the patient becomes distinctly cachectic, 
with a grayish pallor and pronounced anemia. There is inflamma- 
tion of the mucous membranes. 

Arsenic irritates the eyes, causing conjunctivitis, with puffy eye- 
lids. It gives rise to dryness, soreness and burning sensation in 
the mouth and pharynx, with gingivitis, and the patient complains 



TOXTC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 167 

much of thirst. There may be hemorrhage from the gums. There 
is vomiting, accompanied by much straining. The skin shows der- 
matitis, eczema, and often fissures and ulcers, due to contact with, 
arsenical solutions or powders. 

The miners who work in arsenic-bearing minerals, such as cobalt 
compounds, etc., are subject to both the local and general effects of 
arsenic poisoning. The local corrosive effect of arsenic is manifest 
through irritation of the mucous membrane of the upper air pas- 
sages, and such symptoms as nasal catarrh, nosebleed and sensations 
of burning and irritation in the nose are common. Ulcers may 
form within the nose and, as in chrome poisoning (page 183), they 
usually form over the anterior cartilaginous portion of the septum. 
The cartilage may become eroded, but it is rare for the bone struc- 
ture of the septum to be involved. Perforation of the septum may 
result, and such cases have been described by Baumgarten and 
Toeplitz. The middle ear may become involved in a purulent 
inflammation. The larynx and trachea are also irritated, and bron- 
chial catarrh with an irritant cough and blood-stained sputum is 
common. 

In some cases there is gastro-intestinal catarrh. Chronic poison- 
ing among the miners is characterized chiefly by multiple peripheral 
neuritis. Arsenite of copper or Paris green forms a very light 
volatile substance, which is highly irritating to both the skin and 
mucous membranes. It may cause ulceration of the nose, mouth 
and hands. Dr. Alice Hamilton refers to cases of ulceration of the 
feet which became wet with Paris green solution, and states that in 
the Paris green factories in Illinois the workmen are continually 
shifting on account of arsenical poisoning, and usually all are pois- 
oned by the end of the season. 

Two of the organic preparations of arsenic, namely, atoxyl and 
arsacetin, may give rise to optic neuritis as an effect of poisoning, 
thereby resembling the action of methyl alcohol. Traces of arsenic 
may often be obtained from the urine. There are dryness and falling 
out of the hair and nails, eczema and ulcers of the skin. Brown pig- 
mentation of the skin may be diffuse or in patches, and is common. 
One of my patients, a dyer, had marked general bronzing of the skin, 



168 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

and another had been employed for six years as a paint mixer, mixing 
Paris green and white lead. When seen he had chronic eczema of 
both hands and a diffuse mahogany brown pigmentation of the skin, 
but not, as in Addison's disease, affecting the mucous membranes. 
There were small areas of normal-colored skin in the brown pigmen- 
tation, which latter was niost evident over the neck, chest and abdo- 
men, being less so on the extremities. There were no symptoms of 
plumbism. There were no white areas of atrophy of the skin such 
as those seen in Addison's disease. 

In severe cases of arsenic poisoning disturbances of the central 
nervous system obtain, rarely with convulsions. 

Prevention. To protect against poisoning by arsenical dust, espe- 
cially that of Paris green, which is so very volatile, the employee's 
body should be covered as completely as possible. A cap, goggles, 
overalls, gloves and high boots should be worn, and clean cotton 
wool plugs should be placed in the nostrils after anointing them 
with vaselin. Some simple ointment, such as lanolin or cold cream, 
should be smeared over the face in order to prevent eczema. 

In using dyestuffs or other fluid preparations containing arsenic, 
rubber gloves should be worn, and in spraying trees with arsenical 
preparations rubber suits should be worn and the eyes protected 
with goggles. Care should be taken that the spray should not fall 
upon vegetables or grass likely soon to be eaten by cattle, which are 
quite susceptible to arsenic poisoning. 

Treatment. Treatment of acute arsenic poisoning due to fumes 
consists in relieving the pains, cramps and nausea by morphin, and 
the use of cardiac hypodermic stimulation should collapse be threat- 
ening. 

Chronic cases require treatment mainly for the multiple neuritis, 
which is more likely than lead to affect the peripheral sensory nerves. 
At first rest, applications of hot stupes or poultices and menthol or 
camphor liniment should be used. Milk diet should be given until 
the gastric dyspepsia has subsided, and large quantities of water 
should be drunk. Later, for paralysis of the extremities, massage, 
electricity, tonic douches and passive motion should be employed. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 169 

BRASS 

Brass is a compound of the metals zinc and copper. When pure 
and yellow in color these metals exist in proportion 'of two parts 
copper and one of zinc, but in the so-called "regular brass," in dis- 
tinction from "pure yellow brass," the common formula in per- 
centages is as follows: Copper 92, tin 6, lead 1, zinc 1. A cheap 
yellow brass contains 40 to 50 per cent, of zinc. Other percentages 
are also used in various alloys, and the lead may be 7 per cent. In 
addition to the above substances brass-workers may be exposed to 
the effects of arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, nickel and the cyanids. 

Processes of Manufacture. The alloy is made at very high tem- 
peratures in crucibles which are plunged into sunken furnaces. The 
molten mixture is then poured into pattern molds to form castings. 
The castings are, when cooled, dipped into acid solutions of various 
strengths to remove oxidation products and impurities. They are 
then ready for burnishing or polishing en a lathe to acquire a smooth 
surface, and finishing or dressing, lacquering with shellac and bronz- 
ing, may be employed to make the finished product. 

"In the process which involves the pouring of the molten alloy, 
zinc deflagrates, and a dense white smoke fills the casting room, which 
rapidly forms snow-white flakes and powder of zinc oxid. The 
fumes remain for some time in the air of the room, and, where ven- 
tilation is defective (as it usually is), collects upon rafters and ceil- 
ings in dense white incrustations." (Graham-Rogers.) The quan- 
tity of toxic fumes depends upon the amount of zinc used, the venti- 
lation of the casting room and the density of the atmosphere, for 
foggy, moist air favors condensation. 

The temperature at which copper is volatilized is about 237 F., 
and for zinc it is considerably lower; hence zinc fumes may become 
toxic before the copper is volatilized. In making brass a temper- 
ature of 2,000 F. is not usually exceeded. It is during the pouring 
of the molten metal mass from the crucibles into molds that the 
strongest vapors are evolved, and in this process most of the cases of 
"founder's ague" take place, while flocculent zinc oxid flies about the 
workroom. 



170 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Dr. C. T. Graham-Rogers, in the Report of the New York State 
Commissioner of Labor, 1911, writes: 

"Accompanied by Inspector Vogt, some time was spent in a brass 
foundry for fhe purpose of securing samples of air during the periods 
of casting the metal ; twenty-four hours later Mr. Vogt became quite 
ill, and exhibited all the symptoms of zinc .poisoning, the illness 
lasting for several days. Analysis of the samples of air secured 
showed the presence of zinc and copper, which was definite proof of 
the danger from zinc poisoning, since the analyses were confirmed by 
the actual effects upon one exposed to the air. Inquiries made of 
the workmen in this and other brass foundries confirmed the fact, for 
all suffered from the symptoms known as 'brass-founder's ague,' 
which is zinc poisoning." 

The air examined from the casting room was found to contain 
75.2 grams per million liters, in which were 55.2 grams of silica, 
with traces of zinc and copper. 

The smelters and casters^ in addition to exposure to the fumes, 
are subjected to great variations of external temperature and experi- 
ence thirst and perspiration. 

In a report on the brass industry in the neighborhood of Chicago, 
made in January, 1911, by Dr. Emory R. Hayhurst to the Illinois 
State Commission on Occupational Diseases, he thus summarizes the 
disease hazards : 

In this industry the dangers, other than accidents, are: 

In the Foundry, Refining or Smelting Processes 

1. Inhalation of metallic vapors (zinc, copper, tin, lead, phosphorus, 
arsenic, antimony, and nickel). 

2. Inhalation of carbon monoxid and other gases of incomplete combus- 
tion from furnaces. 

3. Handling of lead in some processes in its pure state (refiners, re- 
smelters, babbitt workers, journal-bearing liners), while lead is an alloyed 
constituent of practically all brass and bronze compositions, and indeed in 
all alloys of soft metals. 

4. Effects of fatiguing labor. Workmen complain that they are now 
required to do from one-half to double again as much as they were wont 
to do ten to twenty years ago. . 

5. Women, girls and boys are more susceptible to poisoning from metal- 
lic vapors and dust than men. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 171 

In the Finishing Processes 

6. Inhalation of brass, emery and other dusts (grinding, polishing, buf- 
fing, rubbing, skimming, turning, burnishing, boring, etc.). 

7. Skin irritations from fine brass dust. 

In the Plating Processes 

8. Inhalation of mineral acid vapors where castings are dipped into such 
acids for the purpose of cleaning them preparatory to plating. The acids 
commonly used are mixtures of sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric. 

9. Inhalation of hot potash vapors (cleaning processes). 

10. Inhalations from hot potassium cyanid solutions which_ are contained 
in large tanks or vats and are used as electrolytic solutions. 

11. Shellac vapors are always very noticeable and are detrimental to health 
where wood alcohol or benzene are used as diluents or solvents. 

12. Effects of dampness, standing on wet floors, placing hands and arms 
alternately in and out of water and various solutions. 

Mode of Poisoning. There has been much discussion as to 
which component of the brass alloy is responsible for the symptoms 
of poisoning. These symptoms may be either acute or chronic, the 
acute form being derived solely from the process of moulding or 
casting in which fumes are evolved. The chronic type is more often 
derived from finishing processes such as filing, polishing, etc., in 
which metallic dust is formed. (Fig. 27.) The acute symptoms re- 
semble those of zinc poisoning, whereas those of the chronic form 
resemble those of copper poisoning. The arguments for and against 
the relative influence of the copper and zinc have been presented in 
a study of this subject made by two members of my staff, H. J. 
Schwartz and Montgomery H. Sicard, in the Medical Report of the 
Cornell University Medical College (January, 1905, vol. i). These 
authors state: 

"(1) There is no evidence that the internal administration of 
zinc, even when given in large quantities, ever produces the acute 
symptoms known as brass-founder's ague (which are described be- 
low). 

"(2) The malady has been encountered in men whose work in 
brass was other than that of casting. 



172 



DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



"(3) It is not observed in other operatives, such as galvanized 
iron workers, who are exposed to the fumes of zinc oxid. 

"(4) Zinc is rapidly excreted and does not, like copper, become 
fixed in the body and produce chronic affections." 




FIG. 27. BKASS GRINDING. The men are wearing muzzles; but the emery 
wheels are unprotected, there are no dust aspirating ducts, the belting is

(From the Bulletin of the Illinois State Department of Factory Inspection, 
1911.) 

It is possible, therefore, that the acute "ague" is due to admix- 
ture of the copper and zinc, whereas for the chronic affections copper 
alone is responsible. On the other hand, as against the influence of 
copper in producing the ague, "workers in refined copper do not 
have much trouble and never chills." Possibly much of the ill 
effects are derived from the lead of the poorer grades of brass. 
Sicard visited the largest copper smelting plant in the United States, 
and, apart from the smelters of the crude ore, which has a high ad- 
mixture of lead and arsenic, the workmen were little affected. In 
brass smelting, moreover, the copper oxid is not volatile, but the 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 173 

zinc oxid gives off dense fumes. These authors conclude that this is 
a strong point in favor of the zinc, and not the copper, being 
the cause of brass-founder's ague, a view which most authors advo- 
cate. On the contrary, in finishing processes involving the grinding 
or filing of brass, the copper may be inhaled in dust or conveyed to 
the mouth, and give rise to symptoms of chronic poisoning. (De- 
scribed below on page 176.) 

Kisskalt, in a recent study of "brass-molder's fever" in Kb'nigs- 
berg, noted temperature elevations up to 101.5 F., with a pulse 
rate of 120 accompanying the chills. This author is disposed to 
refer all the phenomena of acute brass poisoning to inhalation of 
zinc vapor. Hayhurst states that from 70 to 80 per cent, of all 
brass founders are subject to founder's ague, and that tolerance is 
acquired by about 70 to 75 per cent, of steady workers. Rarely the 
attacks of ague compel the workman to abandon his job altogether. 
Recent experiments with injecting particles of finely pulverized metal 
into the circulating blood of animals have been found to give rise to 
chills and suggest the possibility of such a factor in brass chills. 

Symptoms. ACUTE BRASS POISONING OR "BRASS-FOUNDER'S 
AGUE/' This was first described by Thackrah, an Englishman, in 
1830. Two cases of brass-founder's ague occurring in my clinic 
have been studied in detail by Schwartz and Sicard. Their histories, 
which may be regarded as typical, may be summarized as follows : 

Case I. The patient, a man forty-two years of age, had been a 
brass molder for three years, during which period he had chills at 
irregular intervals, with chattering of the teeth and sweats. He had 
noticed that these symptoms were most liable to appear if he were 
constipated, or upon returning to work after a brief holiday. They 
also were more liable to appear in damp weather, when metallic 
fumes were heavy in the foundry. He stated that many of his asso- 
ciated workmen had the same symptoms from time to time, together 
with indefinite pains in the lumbar region, joints and extremities, 
but there was notable absence of colic or paralysis. The authors 
quoted followed the patient's own description of his attacks as closely 
as possible. 

"Generally, toward evening, he feels languid, depressed and 



174 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

very cold. He shivers, his teeth chatter, and there are profuse per- 
spiration, severe headache, nausea, and muscular pains and cramps. 
On going home he takes a hot drink (usually milk) and goes to 
bed. He soon vomits, feels feverish, perspires profusely, and falls 
asleep. Next morning he feels weak, but may be able to return 
to work. He also has frequent flatulent dyspepsia, with acid eruc- 
tations, but is not constipated." 

Physical examination showed poor general nutrition. The right 
sciatic nerve was tender and painful. (He had had sciatica for 
three weeks.) There were no disturbances of special senses and 
the viscera were normal. The urine and blood examinations 
showed nothing abnormal. 

Case II. The patient, a man twenty-eight years of age, had 
also been a brass founder for several years, and had had many at- 
tacks similar to those above described, especially when he first began 
to work. "His first sensation is that of increasing languor. The 
prostration is soon extreme, the headache severe, sweating is accom- 
panied by shivering, chattering of the teeth, with finally a hard chill, 
followed by a sensation of feverishness. Vomiting ensues. These 
symptoms, most common in damp or foggy weather, usually develop 
after leaving the factory and passing into the open air. The entire 
seizure lasts from four to six hours, and passes off after a night's 
rest, merely leaving the patient somewhat prostrated. 

"As time progresses the new workers appear to acquire a certain 
degree of immunity, the attacks becoming less frequent and severe, 
but they recur at any time after an absence from work of a few 
days." Almost all the brass foundrymen suffer more or less from 
this group of symptoms, although in varying degree, but rarely are 
they finally compelled to seek another occupation. 

In the symptoms of brass-founder's ague there is interesting 
analogy with the paroxysms of malaria, excepting the absence of 
high fever in the brass ague and the lack of definite periodicity. 
The attacks are so well understood by the workmen that they seldom 
seek a physician's aid, preferring to treat themselves by drinking 
hot milk, which may form an insoluble albuminate with such portion 
of the vapors of both zinc and copper as may have been taken into 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 175 

the mouth, condensed, and swallowed. In fact, they often refer to 
the "chills" as no worse than an attack of seasickness. Predisposing 
factors in producing the ague are alcoholism, poor food and irregular 
hours. 

Case III. A personal case was that of a village blacksmith, 
fifty-six years of age, who had marked paralysis of both arms and 
hands, with atrophy of the extensor muscles of the hand and in- 
terossei, which had lasted for nine months when seen. He stated 
that he had never used lead, but I found that for many years he 
had been in the habit of welding brass implements of various kinds 
in his blacksmith's forge, leaning over and often inhaling metallic 
fumes. He probably also had swallowed much brass dust, for he 
was an inveterate chewer of tobacco and had no washing facilities 
at hand. He had devised a strap reaching from the arm to the 
back of his right hand to enable him to extend the hand and hold a 
hammer, but his grip was very feeble. 

According to Dr. George M. Kober, as many as 75 per cent, of 
new workers in brass foundries, and of those who return to work 
after becoming immune, suffer more or less from "brass chills." 

Dr. Emory R. Hayhurst, in the investigation of brass poisoning 
made in 1909-10 for the Illinois Commission on Occupational Dis- 
eases above referred to, found that among 189 workmen in 78 brass 
foundries, 146 had had illness of some sort referable to their occu- 
pation, and 45, or nearly one-third, had suffered from "brass chills." 
Of 1,761 workmen, about 10 per cent, only were more than fifty years 
of age. This, of course, does not mean an unusual mortality, but 
implies that, from illness, accident, or other causes, the men leave 
the employment. 

In an investigation which I made in December, 1913, of three 
of the largest Bridgeport brass works, in company with Dr. Hayhurst 
and Miss Erskine, we found a number of masters and founders who 
had had brass chills repeatedly in former years, but several of them 
had remained more than thirty years in the employment. They at- 
tributed their present immunity to working chiefly with "red brass," 
which contains a larger percentage of copper than the cheaper grades 
of "yellow brass." In general the men thus employed appeared in 



176 DISEASES DUE TO 1REITANT SUBSTANCES 

very good health, and the criticisms we had to make reflected more 
upon certain general unhygienic surroundings than upon anything 
inherent in the brass industry itself. We were told of the incident 
of three carpenters who were sent to repair a skylight over a casting 
room. The metal fumes rose toward the vent in the skylight, and 
at the end of the day all three carpenters had brass chills, although 
the casters on the floor were immune. 

CHRONIC POISONING BY POWDERED BRASS OR BRASS DUST. The 
inhalation of powdered brass, the dust of brass filings, etc., irritates 
the respiratory mucosa and lungs. The metal may also be swal- 
lowed after inhalation into the mouth, or conveyance to the mouth 
by unclean hands or food or plug tobacco. In this manner chronic 
poisoning in time results, with symptoms which differ considerably 
from those of the ague, above described. Chronic bronchitis is usu- 
ally to be found, and sometimes fibroid phthisis and tuberculosis. 
The digestive system is deranged, and the victim complains of dys- 
pepsia, anorexia, gastro-intestinal catarrh, nausea, vomiting, thirst, 
irregular action of the bowels, occasional intestinal colic, and a metal- 
lic taste in the mouth. The tartar on the teeth may become green 
from a deposit of copper salts. Headache and general muscular 
pains are common, and the patients often become neurotic, depressed 
and hypochondriacal. 

Dr. E. H. Goodman reported, in 1911, a case of chronic brass 
poisoning, in which copper was isolated from the sweat and urine of 
the patient. The man had worked in brass for forty-seven years. 
His undershirt was stained green by perspiration and it was found 
to retain copper. 

Twelve cases of chronic brass poisoning have been studied in my 
clinic during the past few years, several of which may serve to illus- 
trate certain features of the hazard of brass working. 

Case IV. This patient, a man forty-six years of age, had been 
employed for eight years handling bars of brass and copper. He 
had a lead line on the gums, marked granular basophilia, and the 
blood examination further showed a hemoglobin count of only 35 
per cent., erythrocytes 2,160,000 and leukocytes 12,000. He had 
also a chronic nephritis, arteriosclerosis and moderate cardiac hyper- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 177 

trophy. His chief complaints were of dyspnea and constipation. 
He had lost an eye from spattering of molten metal. 

Case V. This patient had been a brass polisher and buffer for 
ten years, using both the emery and rag wheel. He suffered from 
attacks of headache, coryza, rhinitis, persistent cough and recurrent 
bronchitis, with dyspnea. Examination showed chronic bronchitis 
and emphysema. It is probable that the emery dust, as well as 
metallic dust, was responsible for his condition, as he had none of 
the symptoms of lead poisoning which he might have acquired from 
the lead contained in brass. 

Case VI. This man also had been employed for six years in 
work identical with that of the patient, Case IV. For two 
or three years he had noticed that his fingers and toes easily 
became numb and cold, and slight abrasions did not readily heal. 
He was found to have endarteritis obliterans, and in the left radial 
and dorsalis pedis arteries pulsation was entirely lacking. An open 
cut on the left middle finger had not healed during a month's time. 
The hands and feet were cyanotic and were cold to the touch. 

On the other hand, many brass workers remain unaffected by 
the metallic dust. 

One of my patients, a brass polisher who polished small brass 
pieces by hand, used a respirator, and worked in a well-ventilated 
room, cleaned daily. He had good washing facilities. He came to 
Bellevue Hospital for treatment for acute rheumatism and had no 
signs of metal poisoning. He stated that 150 of his co-workers in 
the same hygienic establishment had maintained good health. 

The sandblasting of brass castings is very unwholesome work, 
especially where the castings are so large that they cannot be handled 
in cupboards behind screens, but the workman must stand out in a 
cloud of sand dust in the room with the castings. (See Sandblasting, 
Figure 20, page 117.) 

Prevention. Prevention of the acute form involves strong venti- 
lation and the wearing of respirators. Ague is rare where ventila- 
tion is good. 

Treatment. When an attack of ague commences the workman 
should drink a quart of hot milk, go to bed warmly covered in a 



178 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

well ventilated room and take a cathartic and a teaspoonful of 
aromatic spirits of ammonia -in hot water. If the attacks recur fre- 
quently, he should seek some other form of work. 

The treatment of the chronic form comprises chiefly that of 
chronic bronchitis and indigestion. (See pages 150, 155.) Potas- 
sium iodid may be given in a cough mixture, and dilute hydrochloric 
acid with nux vomica and a simple bitter, such as gentian, may 
improve appetite and digestion. The precautions against conveying 
metal dusts to the mouth, formulated under Dust Prevention, should 
be observed strictly. 

BRONZE 

This substance is made as an alloy containing usually nine parts 
of copper and one of tin, but other metals are sometimes combined 
with the copper, such as aluminum. The manufacture of bronze 
castings does not produce much hazard, but the materials used in 
cleaning and polishing bronze, such as acids, various polishing and 
buffing powders, may give rise to poisoning, especially through irri- 
tation of the lungs. 

Symptoms. Workers in bronze complain of headache, rhinitis, 
conjunctivitis, a metallic taste in the mouth, anorexia, and anemia. 

One of my patients had worked with bronze for twenty-five 
years, without acquiring any definite symptoms of metal poisoning, 
perhaps because his work was mainly outdoors, putting bronze rail- 
ings in place. He had also handled much solder. He had arterio- 
sclerosis, a slightly enlarged heart, blood pressure of 180 mm. and 
albuminuria. These symptoms were not necessarily due to occupa- 
tion, but the man was only forty-eight years of age and gave no 
syphilitic or alcoholic history. There did not appear to be any other 
explanation of the symptoms, therefore, than some form of chronic 
metal poisoning derived from bronze. 

"BRONZE POWDERS" 

The numerous so-called "bronze powders" contain a variety of 
poisonous metals, such as antimony, arsenic, chromium, etc. Gold 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 179 

bronze contains copper and zinc, with impurities such as tin, lead 
or arsenic. Bronze powders are much used for making picture 
frames and mouldings, wall papers, Christmas and Easter picture 
cards, etc., in lithographic establishments. 

Bronzing, to produce metallic effects on paper, wood, leather, 
etc., is done by both dry and wet processes. The surface is first 
covered with an adhesive paste, the powder is dusted on and any 
excess rubbed off after drying. 

Dry bronze powders constitute a serious menace through irrita- 
tion of the respiratory system. When dusted they should be applied 
by a compressed air atomizer, so that the dust may be blown away 
from the operator's face. In other cases they are made into solu- 
tion with various more or less toxic solvents. 

Symptoms. Symptoms of bronze powder poisoning by inhala- 
tion are headache and digestive disorder, such as vomiting and 
diarrhea. There is anemia and the perspiration stains the clothing 
green. 

In lithographic plants in Massachusetts, where boys feed the 
bronzing machines, they breathe through handkerchiefs held before 
the face. 

CHROMIC ACID AND CHROME PIGMENTS 

Manufacture and Uses. The various salts of chromic acid, espe- 
cially the bichromates of potassium and sodium, popularly called 
"bichromes," are manufactured by somewhat elaborate processes, 
involving concentration by boiling, evaporation, roasting, the break- 
ing up of crystalline masses, pulverization by grinding, etc., together 
with the addition of such substances as lime, potash and sulphuric 
acid. The handling of these materials involves much exposure of 
the workmen to irritant fumes, dusts and solutions, with the result 
that practically all of them are sooner or later poisoned in some 
degree. 

The bichromates have many uses in the arts, the most important 
of which are in the production of pigments, especially paints and 
dyestuffs. The making of chrome yellow paints involves the inter- 



180 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

action of lead acetate and potassium bichromate. In dyeing cotton 
yarn and calico printing a similar reaction is utilized for mordant 
purposes. The yarn, after soaking in lime solution, is wrung out 
and placed in a vat of lead acetate solution. When bichromate of 
potassium is used the yellow color of the fiber is produced. In 
calico printing the cloth, after treatment with indigo blue, is printed 
with a forty per cent, paste of potassium bichromate which replaces 
the indigo, or the pattern may be printed with a paste of lead acetate, 
after which the cloth is treated with a two to five per cent, solution 
of the bichromate which fixes the yellow color. Bichromate is, also, 
a mordant for wool in an aqueous solution of from two to four per 
cent. In the making of carbon prints in photography, gelatin with 
a five per cent, (or less) solution of potassium bichromate forms a 
compound through the action of light which is insoluble in hot water. 
Chromic acid and potassium bichromate are ingredients of the emul- 
sion which is spread upon the copper plates used for photo-engraving, 
and engravers of this sort are very subject to "chrome sores." 
Chrome compounds are used in making galvanic batteries, safety 
matches, acetylene, coloring artificial flowers, making anilin prepara- 
tions and colored glass. 

In the bleaching of oils, fats and wax and in the making of various 
coal-tar colors, potassium bichromate is employed. Chromates are 
also used in steel manufacture, tanning and matchmaking. These 
various processes, excepting that they may injure the skin of the 
hands and arms, are not particularly injurious, but they indicate 
the importance and extent of chrome manufacture. 

This manufacture, as described by Sir Thomas Oliver, is con- 
ducted, briefly speaking, as follows: 

Chrome ironstone is first ground to an impalpable powder, which, 
although somewhat irritating to the respiratory system, does not 
produce the diagnostic symptoms of poisoning. The powder is 
mixed with lime and potash, and the mixture roasted in a furnace 
for a period, which, in this country, is about four hours. The fused 
mass or "batch" of neutral chromate of calcium and potash, after 
cooling, is broken into fragments and shoveled into "keeves" or 
vats. This manipulation again stirs up much dust. Lixiviation 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 181 

with water and a solution of potassium sulphate follows, with re- 
sulting slaking of uncombined lime, which evolves steam, impreg- 
nated with chromate dust. The mixture is boiled to concentration 
in successive keeves and finally pumped into evaporating pans. 
These pans should be covered by hoods with ducts leading to the 
open air, otherwise the fumes enter the workroom, as they sometimes 
are permitted to do. Sulphuric acid is now added, with formation 
of potassium sulphate and potassium bichromate. The sulphate is 
withdrawn and the bichromate, when concentrated, is pumped into 
lead-lined evaporating pans in which, after about three weeks, the 
bichromate crystallizes upon the sides and floor of the pans. The 
crystal masses are then broken with a pick, wheeled in barrows to 
be washed, dried in open stoves by hot air or steam pipes, crushed 
and packed in barrels, ready for commercial use. 

Sodium bichromate is manufactured in the same manner, sodium 
carbonate taking the place of potassium carbonate. This salt forms 
a solid cake, which must be broken up, as it crystallizes less readily 
than the potassium salt. Being also more deliquescent, it is more 
easily absorbed by the skin or mucous membranes. 

All the various processes of roasting, boiling down for concen- 
tration and tending the keeves expose the workmen to fumes, the 
more so as their work is arduous and constant. The shoveling, pul- 
verizing and packing the crystals evolve much highly irritant dust, 
which is the chief factor in developing serious skin lesions. In the 
stage of the work in which steam is evolved the chrome dust is widely 
disseminated and deposited in yellow crystals of neutral potassium 
chromate on the rafters of the ceiling, and, even upon any flat sur- 
face a few feet above the evaporating pans, precipitation promptly 
takes place. Oliver states that "a stranger present only for a few 
minutes while the packing is being done has the mucous membrane 
of his nose acutely inflamed for hours, or even for days, after- 
ward." 

Dr. Heise analyzed the air in various parts of a chrome manu- 
factory, and found that a cubic meter of air contained bichromate 
dust as follows: Near the breaking up of cakes of sodium bicar- 
bonate, 6.30 milligrams of the salt; during 15 minutes of packing, 



182 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

1.57 milligrams; over the evaporating pans, with steam evolution, 
0.736 milligram. 

It is an interesting fact that, although potassium bichromate and 
chromic acid produce deep ulcer ation, the former is sometimes suc- 
cessfully employed to heal malignant types of ulcer and alleviate 
new growths, being both antiseptic and corrosive in action. W. Gem- 
mill reported in the British Medical Journal of 1909 (vol. ii, p. 
1225) a rodent ulcer in a woman 82 years of age which was suc- 
cessfully treated with potassium bichromate. It has also been in- 
jected in sublimate solution into the substance of inoperable car- 
cinomata. It is used as a caustic in hypertrophic rhinitis. 

Symptoms and Lesions of Chrome Poisoning 1 . The symptoms are 
both acute and chronic, and are divisible into those affecting the 
respiratory system and cutaneous surface. The first definite de- 
scription of the lesions of chrome poison was published in 1863 in 
France by Becourt and Chevallier. 

ACUTE SYMPTOMS. Acute symptoms are mainly those of coryza 
with sneezing, watery discharge from the eyes and nose, itching and 
burning sensations in the nose, and swelling and congestion of the 
Schneiderian mucosa. These symptoms attack those exposed for the 
first time to chrome fumes or dust, and last from a few hours to 
several days. The symptoms may subside after the workman be- 
comes accustomed to the irritation. Conjunctivitis is common and 
keratitis may occur. 

CHKONIC SYMPTOMS. These symptoms may best be described 
by citation of a typical case, that of a patient who was presented at 
my clinic and whose history was recorded by Dr. C. N. B. Camac as 
follows : 

"The patient, a man 27 years of age, had been an assistant super- 
intendent of chrome works for three years. This brought him into 
intimate contact with both sodium and potassium bichromate, to 
the fumes of which he was often exposed for twelve hours a day. 
Six months after beginning work he felt itching and soreness of 
the septum of the nose, and, on putting his finger into the nostril, 
found a hole in the septum. Shortly afterward he suffered from 
fullness in the head and a sensation as if the nose were 'stuffed up.' 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 183 

On cleaning the nostrils, large plugs were removed which he analyzed 
and found to contain chromic acid.. (The patient was a chemist.) 
He also found chromic acid in the urine. His breath became offen- 
sive and he suffered from nausea, after violent attempts to clear the 
nose and throat. Otherwise, there were no digestive disturbances. 

"About a month before coming to the clinic the patient was 
afflicted with double vision, which occurred without reference to 
fatigue or food ingestion. On closing either eye the symptom disap- 
peared. He also experienced difficulty in concentrating the atten- 
tion, shown particularly in the simple addition of numerals. A 
short walk in the fresh air would enable him to overcome such 
errors. 

"On examining the nose, a round perforating ulcer was dis- 
closed on the nasal septum, 2 cm. from the orifice of the nostril, and 
measuring a little more than one-half a centimeter in diameter, 
with sloughing margins, but without tenderness or bleeding. The 
mouth and throat were negative and the teeth good." 

Two and a half years later the patient was again examined, 
having continued at his work. The nasal ulcer had increased to 1^ 
cm. in diameter and perforation was complete. The ulcer was round 
and at the upper posterior margin was a grayish gelatinous deposit. 
The mucous membrane of the nose was dry and glazed. The hard 
and soft palate were congested, showing plainly numerous small 
blood vessels. The faucial pillars and posterior pharyngeal wall 
were also deeply congested. The teeth were loosened. The patient 
stated that on rising in the morning his nose felt "stuffed up," and 
he usually vomited for ten or fifteen minutes, the vomitus contain- 
ing undigested food and bile. Occasionally he was nauseated after 
eating. He stated that forty men were employed in the chrome 
works, all but four of whom had inflammation of the nose, and about 
half had perforation of the septum. Those who had escaped inflam- 
mation smeared vaselin in the nostrils each day. An office boy in 
the works had recently died, having severe vomiting, and his skin had 
turned yellow after death, presumably from chrome poisoning. 

Hill has reported the case of a boy of thirteen years who was 
employed only twelve days in chrome works in Glasgow when he 



184 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

acquired perforation of the nasal septum. Being somewhat proud 
of it, he wore a ring in it! 

R Fischer reports that, of 228 workmen in a chrome manufac- 
tory, 52 had perforation, 11 more had ulceration, and 6 nasal catarrh 
after a few months' work. In another manufactory in Germany, 
among 60 workmen 27 had perforation of the nasal septum. In 
one case perforation occurred after one week's work. Although the 
perforation is not painful, the inhalation of cold air excites disagree- 
able sensations in the nose. The excessive mucous discharge, some- 
times hemorrhagic, which comes from the epithelial zone around the 
nasal ulcers may cause eczema of the upper lip. 

A few cases have been reported in which ulceration of the tonsils 
and pharynx was observed. 

Oliver examined 176 chrome workers and found 126 with per- 
foration of the nasal septum, 20 more with ulceration, and only 30 
with a normal septum. In 16 cases the sense of smell was impaired. 
In the cases with simple ulceration without perforation the workmen 
have usually been employed only a short time, and perforation com- 
monly occurs between the sixth and twelfth month after exposure. 

Oliver comments upon the relative immunity which some few 
workmen seem to acquire, particularly if they can pass the first few 
months without ulceration. On the other hand, he found perfora- 
tion in one case after seven weeks of employment, and in two others 
it took place in less than three months. Simple ulceration may 
occur as early as within a fortnight. 

The ulceration in the nose is usually confined to the cartilage of 
the septum and does not attack the lateral or upper cartilages or the 
bones of the nose. This is accounted for by the fact that the mucous 
membrane over the septum is adherent and less vascular than else- 
where. If this mucosa is ulcerated, the vascular supply of the 
septum fails and necrosis of the cartilage ensues. Owing to this 
limitation of the ulceration and necrosis, the bridge of the nose does 
not sink in, as it is liable to do after syphilitic destructive ulcer- 
ation. 

The notable absence of pain connected with the ulcerative process 
in the nose prevents the workmen from seeking medical care, and,

aside from the inconvenience of the mucous plugs which collect over 
night in the nostrils and occasional vomiting, there is little inter- 
ference with general health. The strength remains unimpaired and 
rarely do the patients suf- 
fer from bronchial catarrh, 
although in a few cases 
attacks of asthma have 
been noted. 

R. Fischer states that 
men having much hair 
within the nostrils, or the 
so-called "nose beard," 
and those using tobacco 
snuff are less subject to 
chrome irritation of the 
Schneiderian membrane, 
as these things act as 
filters. Catarrh of the 
middle ear and ulceration 
of the external auditory 
canal may occur. 

CUTANEOUS LESIONS. 
Almost all the chrome 
workmen sooner or later 
acquire ulcers of the skin, 
or "chrome holes," as they 
call them. (Fig. 28.) 
The French writers on 
this topic hold that the 
unbroken skin may become ulcerated by long exposure to chrome 
dust, but in the great majority of instances there is a preceding cut 
or abrasion which becomes constantly irritated either in the bichro- 
mate solutions or by the powder or fine crystals Hence the ulcers 
are most likely to form where the skin is liable to slight injury, in 
the creases over the knuckles or at the root of the nails. Scratches 
on the bared arms also may develop into ulcers. They have occa-

ulcers of the fingers and thumb produced

painful and will not heal while work is

der Fabrikarbeiter Deutschlands, Han- 
over, 1911.) 



186 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

sionally been found upon the feet, legs, neck, eyelids, in the external 
ear and various other parts of the body. The ulcers are exceedingly 
indolent and intractable. The margins are indurated and elevated, 
and a tough slough covered by a thick crust may occupy the center. 
The granulation tissue at the base of the ulcers is of a yellowish 
green color. Unlike the mucous membrane ulcers, those of the skin 
are painful and quite often temporarily incapacitate the men from 
work. Owing to their depth, the ulcers are tardy in healing, even 
after the irritation has been eliminated, but they very rarely 'involve 
the tendons, bones or joints. They leave extensive white, irregular 
and depressed cicatrices after healing. 

Hermanni, in a study of 257 chrome workers who had been 
employed 2 or more years, found 45 who had chrome sores. 

R. Fischer ("Die Industrielle Herstellung und Verwendung der 
Chromverbindungen" Berlin, 1911) refers to one case in which a 
workman had 14 chrome sores on his hands simultaneously, and 
another in which there was suppuration of a joint in connection with 
a deep chrome ulcer. The lips and mouth are sometimes ulcerated. 

Hyperidrosis of the hands and feet, followed by eczema, is 
observed in some persons who are new at the work. (R. Fischer.) 

OTHER SYMPTOMS. Other symptoms occasionally observed in 
chronic chrome poisoning are headache, tremors -of the hands and 
tongue, spasm of the eyelids, speech tremor and asthma. A case of 
acute chromic acid poisoning in a straw hat presser is reported by 
Burghart, the material being used for coloring. 

Prevention. Preventive measures against chrome poisoning were 
instituted by law in England in 1893, and in Germany two years 
later, but thus far no such governmental control has been exercised in 
the United States, and the workmen are still at the mercy of careless 
employers, although in some instances partial protection is afforded. 

The preventive measures which always should be adopted are as 
follows : 

1. All keeves and evaporating pans, and especially the vats 
from which steam is evolved, should be covered by hoods connecting 
only with the outer air. 

2. All dust should be removed by exhaust fans or otherwise, 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 187 

and the bichromate should not be allowed to accumulate on the 
rafters or in other parts of the workroom. 

3. In the shoveling and packing processes the workmen should 
be compelled to wear protective respirators and thorough ventilation 
should be provided. 

4. Chrome salts in solution usually do not attack the unbroken 
skin. It is difficult to compel workmen to wear rubber gloves, which 
make the hands clumsy and cause them to sweat. Nevertheless, 
their use should be encouraged in dyeing processes in which chrome 
salts are used. If cuts or abrasions of the skin exist, however, 
ulcers promptly develop on exposure to solutions of the salts, or on 
continued exposure to chrome dust. Such wounds should be pro- 
tected by antiseptic dressings covered by collodion, and Oliver sug- 
gests that foremen should be compelled to report all workmen having 
cutaneous lesions, so that the lesions may promptly be treated and 
the workmen, if possible, assigned to some less hazardous process 
until the lesions have had time to heal. Thick shoes should be worn 
and light, washable overalls. 

5. Medical inspection of all workmen should be made compul- 
sory at least once a week, so that those having commencing lesions 
of the nose or skin may be protected from further and more serious 
hazard. 

6. Proper lavatories and luncheon rooms should be provided. 
Treatment. Treatment of the lesions comprises rest, cleanliness 

and the use of emollients and protective dressings. It is almost im- 
possible for a mucous membrane or cutaneous ulcer to heal if the 
surface be constantly exposed to further irritation by chrome dust 
or solutions. The nasal passages should be kept smeared with vaselin 
and ulcers in the mouth may be washed with glycerin, boric acid 
and tincture of myrrh. Ulcers and abrasions of the skin may be 
dressed with a 40 per cent, ointment of aristol or ichthyol, or with 
balsam of Peru, covered with some simple protective such as anti- 
septic gauze, kept in place by bandages, adhesive zinc plaster or 
collodion. 

The nasal ulcers may be treated with applications of argyrol or 
aristol in vaselin. 



188 .DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

COBALT 

In the Schneeberg cobalt mines it has been found that the miners 
sometimes acquire sarcoma of the bronchial glands and lungs. Cobalt 
is usually associated with other metals, such as arsenic, nickel, etc., 
and peculiarities of poisoning from such ores are described under 
the headings of the combined metals. 

COPPER 

Workers in copper mines and smelters sometimes suffer from 
poisoning, the symptoms of which are intestinal cramps and diarrhea, 
vertigo and a staggering gait. They acquire a greenish blue line 
at the margins of the gums and the hair may become tinged with 
green. It is still an open question, however, how far such symp- 
toms are due to copper itself rather than to the other metals with 
which it is so constantly associated in ores, such as arsenic, lead, 
antimony and zinc. The same statement applies to brass poisoning 
(page 171) and bronze poisoning (page 178), both being alloys of 
copper. Baum and Seeliger have shown, however, that true cop- 
per poisoning may be produced in animals, and some of the salts 
of copper occasion very definite toxic symptoms, such as those de- 
scribed above as occurring in miners and smelters of copper. 

L. Leurin, as a result of study of the workmen in copper and 
brass industries in Berlin and neighboring German establishments, 
concluded that acute copper poisoning may take place, but that 
there is no chronic form of poisoning. (Deutsch med. Woch., 1901, 
689.) The acute form is characterized by gastro-intestinal disorder, 
abdominal cramps and nervousness. The emetic effect of copper 
sulphate is well known, as formerly employed in medicine. 

further experiments and researches are desired to elucidate the 
questions involved in the contradictory statements of different au- 
thors. (See also Brass Poisoning, page 171.) The fact that cop- 
per itself exists in so many different combinations and so many 
other materials are added to it, or otherwise employed in its manu- 
facture, gives rise to the confusion of statements as to genuine dis- 
tinctive copper poisoning. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 189 

Auerbach has reported a case of neuritis from copper poisoning. 
(Zeitschrift fur Nervenheilkunde, 1910, xxxix, 115.) The patient 
was a man 40 years of age who presented symptoms of pain and loss 
of power in the muscles of the right arm, thigh and gluteal region, 
with slight reaction of degeneration. The right knee jerk was lack- 
ing and there was partial anesthesia of the right hand and forearm. 

A case of poisoning with copper oxid is reported in Sozial 
TecJinik (1912, vol. iv, no. 2), in an Austrian workman in an artifi- 
cial fertilizer establishment. The man ate a luncheon of barley 
pudding after warming it on an oven which was covered with the 
copper dust. 

GOLD 

In the manufacture of articles of use and luxury of both silver 
and gold many different processes are resorted to, such as smelting, 
refining, beating, filing, engraving, galvanizing, polishing, making 
alloys, etc. At many of those processes the workmen sit down at 
benches and lean over machines and tables, hence they are liable to 
inhale fumes or dust not only from the metals chiefly worked upon, 
but from substances used for alloys, soldering, electroplating and 
etching, etc. Where blowpiping is employed, as in soldering small 
articles of jewelry, there is more or less strain of the lungs, for the 
workman must blow hard and continuously, and hence there is 
a tendency to the production of emphysema. (Fig. 29.) In gold 
refining concentrated sulphuric acid is used, the fumes of which are 
highly irritating. 

In gilding by the galvanic process the ware made of copper or 
zinc or other metal is cleansed in benzene and then plunged into a 
solution of gold and potassium cyanid. The benzene vapor is very 
irritating, especially to young persons who are often employed in the 
cleansing process. Its effects are described under Benzene. The 
workmen occupied in the dipping process are subject to chronic 
eczema of the hands, face, nose and ears. 

In gold plating a boiling solution of salt, saltpeter and hydro- 
chloric acid is used from which chlorin vapor may arise. In another 
process of gilding and silvering mercury is used for a surface amal- 



190 



DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



gam and a brass brush is employed. Mercury vapor may be evolved 
in the process. Lead vapor is given off in gold enameling. Hence 
the handling of gold and making of gold and gilded wares are more

injurious from the hazards of other metals used lead, mercury, 
etc., or acid fumes- than from anything especially toxic in gold 
itself. 

This metal was formerly used for alleged medicinal effect and 
gf recent years has figured in a "cure" for chronic alcoholism. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 191 

There is really no such condition as poisoning by gold alone. The 
symptoms which affect gold workers are referable to the above de- 
scribed conditions of heat, cramped positions in work, poor ventila- 
tion, the presence of irritant fumes, etc. Such conditions strongly 
predispose to tuberculosis. Owing to the value of the metal, where 
gold is being filed or beaten strong ventilation currents cannot be 
used without dissipating the precious gold dust. I know of at least 
one gold-beater's shop in which there are no general ventilators and 
the windows have to be kept closed, but at intervals small hoods are 
let down over the worktables and the room is then well aired. 

IRON AND STEEL 

Steel workers, i. e., foundrymen, rolling mill men, and the like, 
are exposed to toxic gases, especially carbon monoxid, to the hazards 
of excessive heat and the glare of excessive light, to irritation of the 
lungs from steel dust, causing pneumonoconiosis, and to chronic 
nephritis and arteriosclerosis. 

It has been shown by German statistics given by Rb'pke, in 
1903-5, that in steel mills, of the illnesses among the workmen, 20 
to 22 per cent, concerned the respiratory organs. 

Iron is in no sense a chemical irritant to the body, being a natu- 
ral ingredient of the hemoglobin. Iron and steel dust, however, by 
virtue of the hardness and sharpness of the particles, *are irritant 
to the bronchial mucosa when inhaled, and foster the development of 
fibroid phthisis and subsequent acquisition of pulmonary tubercu- 
losis. The smelting of iron and steel and various hardening proc- 
esses are capable of being injurious in several ways. Thus the 
workmen are exposed to great heat and perspiration which is often 
suddenly checked, especially in winter. The excessive heat and light 
to which puddlers and founders are exposed when the glare from 
furnace doors reaches them may injure the eyes permanently, and 
they may acquire superficial or more serious burns. Particles of 
steel or iron may be driven into the skin of the face and exposed 
upper half of the body, marking it like tattoo. The workmen, as a 
result of frequent extreme changes in temperature, are prone to 



192 



DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



lumbago or myalgia and chronic rheumatism, and, from heavy lifting, 
frequently have sprains and muscle strain. In galvanizing sheet 
iron hydrochloric acid is used, the fumes of which are injurious. 
Various processes of steel hardening are liable to prove harmful 
through the action of other substances, such as the cyanids, ferro-

fumes of hot oil and steam. 

silicon, etc. Cutlery and other articles of steel manufacture are 
dipped into baths of molten lead or boiling oil (Fig. 30), the fumes 
from which may prove highly injurious. In the hot rooms in which 
smelting and hardening processes are conducted the workmen are 
subject to acute and chronic nasal catarrh, and Sager and Weickert 
have found otitis media as a further not uncommon result. Ropke 
("Berufskrankheiten des Ohres") has described perichondritis of 
the external ear caused by the packing of hard metallic dust in the 
auditory meatus. He also found labyrinthine inflammation in some 
cases. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 193 

In smelting works the laborers are much exposed to inhalation 
of toxic gases from the ovens, especially carbon monoxid derived 
from coke or otherwise. In such cases headache, vertigo and tinnitus 
are complained of, and anemia and nervousness ensue. Kayser 
(Wiener med. Woch., 1893, No. 41) reported a case of such poison- 
ing in which the victim remained 36 hours in coma, and on recovery 
presented symptoms of labyrinthine disease. Such extreme cases 
are very rare. Rohrer (Haugs klin. Vortr., Bd. I, Heft 3) re- 
ported 5 cases among furnace stokers who were subjected to inhala- 
tion of water gas, with the result of chronic carbon monoxid poison- 
ing. They suffered from headache, nausea and disturbances of 
hearing which were both nervous and due to otitis. Erosions of 
the nasal septum and atrophic rhinitis were also observed occa- 
sionally. 

The danger to the lungs of cleaning iron and steel castings is 
most serious, and is illustrated by Figure 30, page 194. In open- 
hearth processes and breaking up of iron molds of castings particles 
of coal or charcoal and iron rust are inhaled and the workmen sweat 
heavily. Thus they are exposed to nasal, bronchial and middle ear 
catarrhs. The sharp particles of dust accumulate in crusts with the 
nasal mucus and cause ulceration and epistaxis. There may be atro- 
phic rhinitis with loss of sense of smell and uncomfortable dryness 
of the nose. The atrophy may involve the mucosa of the naso- 
pharynx, which becomes reduced in sensibility so that mucus accu- 
mulates without exciting expulsive effort. This lack of sensation 
may favor the further entrance into the bronchi and lungs of irri- 
tant material. Graphite and coal dust were found by Merkel im- 
bedded in the lungs in four autopsies upon men who had been em- 
ployed as iron molders. 

Particles of steel and iron dust which reach the pulmonary 
alveoli choke them up and become imbedded in their walls, where 
they excite perialveolar irritation with inflammatory products, chiefly 
fibrous. (See Fibroid Phthisis, page 33.) 

Countless small articles of iron and steel, comprising industrial, 
agricultural and domestic hardware, surgical and other instruments, 
etc., require grinding, sharpening and polishing. These processes 



194 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

are conducted in various ways upon stone, emery or steel wheels, and 
more or less dust is liberated, according as the wheel is used dry or 




FIG. 31. STEEL CASTING GROUND ON AN EMERY WHEEL. Note the downward 
direction of the sparks as in the German method. In the English method 
they are directed upward. Note the lack of dust aspirator, of adequate 
protection of the wheel, and of goggles to protect the workman's eyes. 
Hazards: steel and emery dust. 

kept moist with a stream of water. Details of the hazard from these 
processes are given under Emery Dust. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 195 

Another source of dust irritation is connected with the industry 
of making handles of knives and other implements of horn, bone, 
ivory, mother of pearl, etc. The grinding and polishing of these 
materials add considerable dust to that of the steel and the grinding 
wheels. 

In the New York subway much iron and steel dust is ground 
off by the attrition of the steel brakes against the malleable iron 
wheels. This dust, by the actual measurement of the worn-out 
brake shoes, according to Mr. Soper, the sanitary expert of the 
subway, amounts to no less than a ton per mile per month. It is 
blown about by the rush of the trains and enters the cars. Dr. T. M. 
Prudden, by passing a magnet along the window sills in some of the 
cars, accumulated a considerable quantity of iron dust. It was at 
first supposed that the trackwalkers, motormen and guards, who 
spent half their time in the subway, would become victims of 
pneumonoconiosis. Examinations of the employees made by Dr. 
James A. Miller showed "that they had no impairment in health be- 
cause of their occupation ; many gained in weight ; in the common par- 
lance, they gained 'subway fat,' " especially the motormen, whose 
occupation is sedentary. 

In polishing and sharpening very small needles and similar 
objects they have to be held near the eyes, and water cannot be used 
to moisten the emery wheels, hence there is the double hazard of 
irritation of the respiratory passages by steel and emery dust and 
injuring the eyes. 

In Sheffield, England, in eight years, from 1901 to 1909, the 
mortality among steel grinders and polishers in the hardware indus- 
try was 30.4 per 1,000 workmen, of which one-half was due to 
tuberculosis and more than one-sixth to other pulmonary diseases. 
In other words, two-thirds of all the deaths among this class of 
workmen were due to pulmonary disease. Considering the fact that 
such workmen belong to a selected group as to age and original 
strength, this is a very high mortality rate for lung diseases. In 
Solingen, Austria, where the same industries are conducted on a 
large scale, the same ratio prevails of one-half the deaths caused by 
tuberculosis, although the total death rate is considerably less than 



196 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

in Sheffield. In Solingen, in 1910, while the general mortality 
from tuberculosis was 1.8 per 1,000, in the hardware industry it 
was 9.3 (Rambousek). Surely alcoholism, low wages, poor home 
hygiene and all the other etiological factors of tuberculosis do not 
account for such enormous differences in mortality rate, and the 
conclusion is inevitable that the cutlery industry is shockingly haz- 
ardous as at present conducted. 

In Northampton, Massachusetts, are large cutlery and tool-making 
plants. In a Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts 
for 1907 the grinders and polishers employed in these industries 
showed a mortality from pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis, 
of nearly 73 per cent., as compared with other diseases. A case of 
pulmonary emphysema was reported to the ]S T ew York State Bureau 
of Labor which resulted from manufacturing steel wool. 

In foundries, rolling mills, steel plate works and the like, the 
^lifting of heavy weights tends in time to strain the circulation and 
give rise to cardiac hypertrophy. Excessive sweating in these occu- 
pations leads to lessening of the fluidity of the blood and induces 
excessive thirst, which the workmen often assuage with quantities 
of beer and other alcoholic drinks. The combination of vascular 
strain and alcoholism leads to early arteriosclerosis, which in turn 
results in hypertrophy of the heart. When large quantities of cold 
fluids are drunk acute gastro-intestinal catarrh is very liable to ensue. 

In many steel finishing processes, as in gilding swords, etching 
knife handles, etc., sulphuric or other acids are used, the fumes 
from which greatly irritate the respiratory passages. (See Mineral 
Acids. ) 

LEAD 

General Statements. Plumbism and saturnism are used as 
synonyms for lead poisoning. Lead, like copper, has figured promi- 
nently in mechanical industry since very early history. In the third 
century u. c., Theophrastus described the use of white lead as a 
paint, and the Romans, in the first century A. D., operated lead 
mines in England. 

Lead poisoning was first accurately described in the writings of 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 197 

Tanquerel des Planches in 1839, although often referred to in gen- 
eral terms much earlier. 

Although metallic lead may be the source of poisoning, as in 
handling lead bars or inhaling the fumes of molten -lead, it is its 
salts or other compounds, such as alloys, which are the common 
toxic agents, mainly on account of their dissemination in the work- 
shop as dust or their ready solubility in the blood and secretions of 
the body when introduced as dust or in any other form, especially 
that of either moist or dry paint. 

The modes of entrance of lead into the body are several. As a 
fume it is inhaled, and as a dust it may be inhaled in the lungs or 
lodge in the mouth and be swallowed, or the dust may be conveyed 
to the mouth by unclean hands, with food eaten in the workroom, 
or with chewing tobacco. Moreover, the workman's clothing may 
become saturated with lead fumes or dust so that he carries the 
poison into his home. Lead has little if any action upon the un- 
broken skin, but it has long been used medicinally in the form of a 
diluted lotion or wash to relieve inflammations of the skin, such as 
erysipelas and ulcers, being somewhat soothing and antiseptic. It 
is also given sometimes by mouth for its astringent action in diarrheal 
conditions, hence the constipation of lead poisoning. 

Lead poisoning, or plumbism, is one of the oldest known occupa- 
tional diseases, having been described for many centuries. Hippoc- 
rates recognized lead colic, and Raphael, Correggio and Michael 
Angelo afford well known historical examples of plumbism acquired 
through mixing their own paints. 

Lead poisoning has been more thoroughly studied than any other 
occupational disease, which is due in part to the great number of 
workmen employed in lead trades and the great variety of manufac- 
tures in which the metal plays an important, if not the sole, part. 
It is also due to the great variety of lead compounds, alloys and 
salts, and to the fact, no doubt, that the symptoms of serious plumb- 
ism, such as paralyses and colic, have become familiar to laymen 
and hence are easily recognized by workmen themselves and attributed 
to their proper cause, which is not the case with many other poisons. 

Number of Occupations Involving Lead Compounds. Among all 



198 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

the toxic metals, lead gives rise to more than one-half of all cases 
of serious poisoning, and more than 150 different trades subject 
the workman to plumbisin. Layet gives 111 processes in which 
lead or its salts is used in France, and Dr. Alice Hamilton found 
70 in the State of Illinois alone. 

Among these trades the most important, considered from the 
number of employees and the certainty with which some of them 
are sooner or later affected, are the following, which comprise about 
85, or more than half of the total number of lead trades in which 
instances of poisoning have been observed :

the hazards of different lead trades, based on 1,383 cases of saturnism 
in Prussia, as follows, commencing with the most hazardous, making

white lead, lead oxid and the amorphous oxid or minium, shot- 
making, painting, lead smelting, printing. 

Number of Workers in Lead and Frequency of Lead Poisoning. 
The number of employees in lead works and establishments in 
which there is a hazard from using paint or other lead compounds 
is very large. Some idea of this number may be gathered from the 
following data, which include, also, the percentage of victims of 
plumbism. 

In Illinois there are 20,000 union painters and probably as many 
non-union ones. In that State there is much manufacture of rail- 
way cars, automobiles, harvester machinery, etc., which requires 
"enamel" and other forms of high class painting. As this work 
involves considerable rubbing and sandpapering, it affords a fertile 
field for poisoning. In this State also are many large plants for 
the manufacture of lead products. Upward of 25,000 persons are 
employed in the United States in the printing and bookbinding 
trades. 

During the decade 1900 to 1910, under the British notification 
act, about 7,000 cases of lead poisoning have been reported in 18 
industries, which would average nearly two a day ! Some few of 
these, however, amounting to 4.2 per cent., were duplicate cases, 
more than one attack occurring during the decade in the same 
victim. (Oliver.) Of the total cases, 1,973 were among house 
painters and plumbers, with 383 deaths, according to the Annual 
Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops of Great 
Britain. There were 200 cases of plumbism among printers during 
this period, including 17 deaths. 

In England, in 1909, there were 1,257 cases of lead poisoning 
recorded, despite excellent protective laws, and there is an annual 
average there of about 70 deaths from saturnism. In Austria, in 
1906, there were 765 cases, and in Germany 700 cases. In Great 
Britain, among the 63,000 potters, 11 per cent, are exposed to 
risk of lead poisoning, according to statements of Sir Thomas Oliver, 
and nearly 30 per cent, to the dangers of irritant dusts. 

Of the Prussian lead smelters, in 1905, 17.7 per cent, acquired 
lead colic and paralysis. In Paris, where there are 14,000 painters 



202 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

and as many more craftsmen whose work necessitates contact with 
lead, the average annual admission rate in the hospitals is 250 cases 
of plumbism. 

In Vienna, according to Dr. Ignace Kaup, during a decade there 
were 944 cases of plumbism reported among painters. 

Dr. E. E. Pratt, in a report to the Committee on Industrial 
Diseases of the New York Association for Labor Legislation, re- 
ported the finding of 376 cases of lead poisoning in New York City 
in 1909-1911. Of these a personal study was made by him in 110 
cases. Some of these cases were in Bellevue Hospital. 

Under the New York State physicians' reporting law there were 
reported, as occurring in the State from September 1, 1911, to 
August 31, 1912, 125 cases of lead poisoning, with one death (that 
of a painter), which are listed as follows by industries:

In the two years 1909 and 1910 there were 60 deaths from 
lead poisoning in New York State, found by Dr. John B. Andrews, 
formally certified by physicians. The following excerpt is taken 
from his admirable research into the history of these fatal cases 
(Bulletin 95, United States Bureau of Labor, 1912) : 

"These 60 fatal cases, as officially recorded, were distributed 
among the following occupations: 

"Thirty-seven were painters, 8 were laborers, 4 were printers, 2 
were merchants, and there was one each from the machinists, molders, 
smelters, tinsmiths, salesmen, brush drawers, glaziers, porters, and 
coopers. 

"The 1 glazier, however, was also a painter; the 1 salesman was 
in reality a paint mixer; the machinist packed parts of machinery 
that were still wet with paint ; of the 2 merchants 1 was a painter 
and mixer of paints and the other sifted white lead in a factory; of 
the 8 laborers, 1 was a house painter, a second was a painter who 
had also worked in a white lead works, a third was a packer of 
machine parts still wet with paint, a fourth worked in a rubber toy 
factory, 2 worked in a lead smelter, and 2 in an electric accumulator 
or storage battery works ; the brush drawer worked with pads coated 
with paint; the porter operated a press in a lead pipe factory; of 
the tinsmith little can be learned, but the cooper was a stack hand 
and filler of barrels in a white lead works. Of the 4 printers, one 
was a hand compositor on bookwork, one was a job printer doing all 
parts of the work of a printer, a third was a stereotyper, and the 
fourth a linotype operator on newspaper work. 

"Briefly, then, 45, or 75 per cent, of the 60, worked with wet 
paint, 3 worked in a lead smelter, 4 in printing establishments, 3 
had worked in white lead factories, 2 in a storage battery plant, 1 in 
a tin shop, 1 in a rubber factory, and 1 in a lead pipe factory." 



204 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Among these cases one is recorded as of "cerebral type" and 
four others presented hemiplegia. Only one patient was a woman, 
a brush drawer, 59 years of age, who had apoplexy. 

In the eight years from 1903 to 1912 there were admitted 238 
cases of lead poisoning to the wards of Bellevue Hospital and the 
Medical Clinic of the Cornell University Medical College in New 
York City. Of these cases 26 were acute. In an investigation of 
lead poisoning in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1913, records of 
94 cases were supplied by a single physician. In Philadelphia, 
within a recent period of 16 months, 97 cases of lead poisoning 
were treated in hospitals. 

Dr. Alice Hamilton reported at the First National Conference 
on Industrial Diseases, June 10, 1910, that she had found lead 
poisoning among the workers in 33 out of 56 lead factories inspected 
in Illinois, and that in that State there was a yearly average of 665 
cases. In six factories alone were 380 cases. She further writes as 
follows : 

"One of the large white lead factories in England employs 182 
men. No man was poisoned there during the year 1910. A Diissel- 
dorf factory had 2 cases of lead poisoning among 150 men during 
the same year. On the other hand, an Illinois factory with about 
142 employed throughout the year had 25 cases last year, and 
another employing from 70 to 80 men had 11 cases during two 
months' time, which, if kept up during the year, would mean 66 
cases. The British statistics for 1910 show that, in the district of 
Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1,320 persons were employed in white lead 
works ; 5 cases of lead poisoning were reported for that year, or one 
in 264 men employed. One case was fatal. The figures for the 
same year in Illinois are between 425 and 450 men employed; 63 
known cases of poisoning, or one for every 7 men employed ; 3 fatal 
cases." 

She also states that the ratio of lead poisoning as reported for 
English pottery dippers was one case among 65 employed, but in 
Ohio it was one among 6.6. 

The Illinois State Commission on Industrial Diseases discovered 
640 cases of plumbism in that State in 1910. In some lead smelting 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 205 

works from 25 to 40 per cent, of the workmen abandon the work 
every month on account of acquiring lead poisoning. 

Of late years, owing to improved sanitation, legislation and in- 
spection, the number of lead poisoning cases has been so far re- 
duced that it is probably not more than one-half as common as it 
was some time ago. For example, Legge has stated that, whereas in 
England, in 1900, more than a thousand cases were reported, only 
553 were reported ten years later, despite a more complete system 
of reports. 

In England, moreover, in 1896, before the passage of preventive 
laws, the ratio of lead poisoning among 2,499 workers in lead plants 
was identical with what it now is in this country, i. e., 1 case to 7 
employees. 

Dr. Alice Hamilton makes the following instructive compari- 
sons: 

In an English white lead factory with proper modern standards 
of sanitation, during the year 1909-10, there was not a single case 
of plumbism among the 182 men employed, but in an Illinois fac- 
tory at the same time, where fewer men were employed only 142 
there were 25 cases of plumbism. Comparing another English 
factory, with 92 workmen, no cases developed during five years, 
whereas, in an Illinois one with 94 workmen, 28 per cent, of the em- 
ployees had had plumbism, and 40 per cent, of those working in 
the dustiest rooms. In Newcastle-on-Tyne, in 1910, among 1,320 
workers in white lead, one case of plumbism developed per 264 men 
employed ; but in Illinois, in the same year, one case developed for 
every 7 men employed, with a total of 3 fatal cases. This strikingly 
emphasizes the value of weekly medical inspection as conducted in 
England, compared with its usual omission in this country. 

By a rational system of hygiene Germany reduced the incidence 
of poisoning among lead smelters from 73.7 per cent, in 1885 to 0.8 
per cent, in 1892, but among painters in Berlin, in 1904 and 1905, 
there were 870 cases of plumbism and 17 deaths. (Karl Wachter, 
"Die gewerbliche Bleivergiftung," 1908.) 

In the Government Printing Office in Washington only 9 cases 
of lead colic were reported in 1906, owing to improved hygiene. 



Varieties of Lead and Its Compounds ; Their Derivation and Uses. 
The varieties of lead compounds are very numerous and possess 
varying degrees of toxicity for the organism. Its physical state may 
also vary ; thus it is found in several compound ores, as a pure metal, 
in the form of dust, filings, etc., in dense fumes which arise in 
smelting works, in solutions, such as are used in the glazing of 
pottery, and in alloys with other metals, especially in brass, pewter, 
etc. 

METALLIC LEAD. Metallic lead, when mined, is found chiefly 
in impure form, being combined with a variety of other substances, 
especially sulphur, antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, tin, silver. Most 
important among these compounds is lead sulphid, or galena, and 
after the fragments of ore are separated and crushed, the ore is 
smelted with scrap iron, which combines with the sulphur, releasing 
the molten lead. Or the sulphur may be burned off in roasting 
tubes, leaving lead oxid and sulphate, which, on being further 
decomposed by greater heat, produce metallic lead and sulphuric 
acid. There is thus abundant opportunity for poisoning from sev- 
eral sources such as the gases of combustion, carbon monoxid and 
dioxid and the fumes of sulphur, acids and sometimes metals which 
constitute impurities. Lead oxid dust is carried off in the fumes 
to a considerable extent. Not only is the air of the roasting and 
smelting rooms polluted, but the outside air for some distance 
around the works destroys vegetation and acts deleteriously upon 
human lungs. Formerly lead smelters were very liable to serious 
poisoning, and they still are so where precautions are neglected, 
but modern methods have done much to mitigate the evils. Frit- 
ting the lead oxid from other metal compounds, especially silver, 
cleaning the flues and furnaces are occupations which even under 
most favorable conditions always possess great risk of begetting 
plumbism. (Fig. 32.) 

Metallic lead is further molded, rolled or pressed into sheets, 
bars, pipes, conduits for electric cables, etc. 

In roasting ore by the open or "Scotch Hearth" process the work- 
men rake out red-hot lumps of slag which are not wholly free from 
lead and emit toxic fumes. There is further hazard from dust in 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 207 

crushing the cold slag and in cleaning the bags into which ventilating 
flues may conduct the furnace fumes. 

The fumes of lead and zinc refineries deposit residue, on the 
walls of the furnace flues, of lead sulphid. carbonate and oxid, zinc

and hazardous. (From the Bulletin of the Illinois State Department of 
Factory Inspection, 1911.) 



and antimony oxids, calcium carbonate, arsenic and silicic acid, etc. 
These substances are borne out into the surrounding atmosphere. 
Sulphurous acid fumes also are liberated, and this gas is harmful 
if present in the air in a strength of more than 0.004 per cent. To 
collect the poisonous fumes, as well as to recover from them some of 
the volatilized metals, the flues are made very large and long. They 
are usually high enough for a man to stand upright within when 
cleaning out the lead deposit, and may be curved, with a total length 
of several miles. In some cases steam or water is sprayed at inter- 



208 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

vals within the flues, to cool and condense the vapors. In other 
cases they are forced through water tanks by aspiration. 

According to Sir Thomas Oliver, 130 Ibs. of lead oxid and sul- 
phate may be given off in fumes from the smelting of a single ton of 
lead ore. Sufficient lead escapes into the air to poison cattle graz- 
ing near by such smelting works as those of Scotland and Belgium. 
In recovering the deposited lead the workmen should not remain 
longer than two hours in the flues, and even at the end of an hour 
they may become ill with vomiting and headache. In some of the 
Austrian smelting works the fumes are forced through water in bent 
tubes, and the open hearths employed are protected from back draft 
by double hoods, so that very little lead fume escapes and the work 
is much less dangerous. The arsenic and antimony which lead ores 
often contain add to the danger of the fumes. 

Metallic lead is not very soluble by any of the body fluids, but 
when exposed to the air oxidation constantly produces a thin coating 
of fine dust of lead oxid which may adhere to the fingers or be 
blown about and inhaled. 

Lead does not melt under a temperature of 633 I\, and its 
fumes are composed of lead oxid and suboxid in a state of very fine 
subdivision. The skimmings or dross of lead melting pots are 
largely composed of lead oxids, and when they are disturbed on the 
surface of the melting pot, as by stirring with a ladle or adding 
pieces of lead plates, as in linotyping, the fine lead dust is liberated 
at temperatures considerably below the boiling point of the metal. 
Such skimmings, if thrown upon the floor, become pulverized by 
tramping feet and add their dust to the menace of poisoning. 

Metallic lead is used by plumbers, in electric wire conduits, in 
tinsmithing, to imbed jewelry for polishing, files for cutting, and 
other small articles, in the production of lead pipe, sheet lead, as a 
molten bath for tempering steel. 

In making shot metal metallic lead is fused in an iron kettle, 
covered with charcoal powder and arsenous acid, or metallic arsenic 
is added. The mass is then stirred, with evolution of both lead 
and arsenic fumes. 

The Jacquard loom is often weighted with lead, which gives off 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 209 

much dust from the warps. Iron is just as serviceable and should 
be used instead. The attrition of the weights suspended over pul- 
leys wears off much dust which on analysis has been found to con- 
tain 56 per cent, of lead. 

In polishing cannon balls and shells a revolving lead disc is 
sometimes used. 

LEAD OXIDS. There are several oxids of lead, PbO, called 
litharge or massicot, PbO 2 , Pb 2 O 3 and Pb 3 O 4 , or minimum, all of 
which are toxic. 

The oxid known as red lead is produced by roasting the metal in 
ovens with a strong draft of air. During the process, which re- 
quires about 8 hours, the ovens are frequently opened and the lead 
is raked. There is considerable escape of lead fumes, and in Eng- 
land, among the reported cases of plumbism, two per cent, are 
among makers of this product. The men should use very long raking 
implements and the ovens should be shielded by hoods. 

This form of lead, and also litharge, is much used for electric 
accumulators, dry color making, ' rubber making, pottery, tile and 
brick glazing, putty powder for polishing and enameling, plumbing, 
and for sanitary ware, signs, etc. 

Putty is made by mixture of whiting, linseed oil, and usually 
red or white lead. The lead is added as a preservative to promote 
hardening in the air and to prevent rust. For fixing iron to stone, 
glycerin with red oxid of lead is used. 

LEAD CARBONATE. The making of white lead or basic lead 
carbonate is a process involving much time and danger. It is con- 
ducted in a closed chamber and requires about three and a half 
months. The chamber is filled with layers of earthen jars (Fig. 
33), superimposed with layers of boards, with tan bark and some- 
times horse dung between. Strips or "buckles" of metallic lead are 
laid across the mouths of the jars, which are filled with dilute acetic 
acid. The acid vapor arising converts the lead to an acetate, which 
in turn is made into a basic carbonate by the carbonic acid gas and 
warmth arising from the fermentation of the tan bark. The temper- 
ature of the fermentation chamber may reach as high as 140-150 F. 
This process is known as the "Dutch process," and the layer of 



210 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

jars and bark as the "blue bed." At the conclusion of the process, 
which lasts eight to ten weeks, the "blue beds," now become "white 
beds," are found to contain the basic carbonate of lead in dusty 
masses adherent to what remains of the corroded metal. The car-

bonate is sprayed with water to lessen the dust, taken out, washed 
and ground to a pulp, and then placed in jars on shelves in rooms 
called "stoves." The stoves are heated to 70 C., or more, for 48 
hours, or sometimes for as long as a week, to dry the preparation. 
Uncorroded fragments of lead from the beds are sifted out and 
either returned for further treatment with acetic acid or remelted. 
Handling these dusty fragments is a very hazardous occupation. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS

(Figs. 34, 35.) The carbonate is ground, washed and allowed to 
settle in large vats. (Fig. 36.) After grinding and drying, the 
finished product is dumped into barrels. The emptying of the stoves

to remove the dry carbonate, the packing of it in barrels after re- 
grinding, and final mixing with oil to make paint are all dusty and 
dangerous processes. When women were permitted to work in the 
stoves (as they no longer are) they have been known to acquire fatal 
lead poisoning in a few weeks, according to Sir Thomas Oliver. By 
the Besangon process, as conducted in Paris, the water from the pulp 
is excluded by rollers on which oil is made gradually to replace the 
water present. In this manner oil paint is mixed by machinery 
and the whole process is freed from dust. 

There are various modifications of the processes described above, 



212 DISEASES DUE TO IEEITANT SUBSTANCES 

but the principle is the same in all. Dr. Hamilton found the foreign 
lead works far ahead of those in this country in details of machinery

employed, as well as in protection of workmen from dust. Water 
spraying is much more general and dry sweeping is prohibited. 

Other methods of manufacturing lead carbonate have befn de- 
vised, such as forcing a mixture of hot carbonic acid gas and acetic 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 213 

acid fumes over metallic lead in sheets, or forcing CO 2 through 
basic acetate of lead solution, but none of these different methods, 
for various reasons, have met with the favor of the old Dutch oven 
process. 

Sometimes grape and other fruit skins, in wine-making coun- 
tries, are used instead of manure to evolve CO 2 by fermentation. 




FIG. 36. WHITE LEAD SETTLING TUBS. Here the lead carbonate is moist and 
the risk is from handling more than from dust. 



Dr. Hamilton, writing of "The Hygiene of the White Lead In- 
dustry" (Jour, of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, June, 
1911), stated: 

"In Belgium I saw an interesting device. The barrel stronger 
and better built than ours is already headed up and the lid has a 
round hole some six inches in diameter. Into this is fastened one 
end of a strong rubber tube, the other end of which is hanging from 
the bottom of the white lead hopper. As the powder falls into the 
barrel it is shaken down because each barrel stands on a platform 



214 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

which is made to jump up and down by means of compressed air. 
I saw a whole roomful of barrels in process of filling and not a 
particle of dust. These of course need no heading-up, another 
great advantage. Heading-up is considered dangerous work, and all 
sorts of devices are being experimented with. In Germany, as in 




FIG. 37. PAINT MAKING. Grinding oil colors. Clearness of the picture is 
obscured by dust. Note the absence of overalls, absence of ventilation and 
the poor illumination. 

some of our factories, each barrel is lined with strong paper which 
is folded down over the top before the lid is put on. In an English 
factory they are trying a lid with expanding leaves, which fits into 
place without hammering." 

Lead carbonate is applied to lace to whiten it and add to its 
weight. It is also used to stamp stencil patterns on dark textures. 
It is used in powdered form by tanners in finishing leather. It is 
an ingredient of various cosmetics, in which form it has often given 
rise to poisoning. 

In making many paints white lead is first dried, then pulverized 



TOXIC METALS AttD THEIK COMPOUNDS 215 

and diluted with oil and pigments. It is often possible to add the 
oil while the lead is still moist, thereby saving labor and greatly 
reducing risks from dust. (Fig. 37.) 

Some paste paints are made with a rosin binder, glue and dex- 
trin, or other adhesive materials, so that they may be diluted with 
water instead of with the usual agents, turpentine and oil, but they 
afford no less risk of lead poisoning, and possibly more than the 
commoner sorts of paint. 

White and red lead, besides their extensive use in paints, are 
also employed in the making of glass, pottery glazing, the making 
of paper and rubber articles, and by gas fitters and plumbers in 
connecting the segments of pipes. 

ENAMEL. Enamel for iron ware is made in various ways. A 
common method is the following: An alloy of tin, 18 parts, and 
lead, 100 parts, is oxidized by heat and pulverized with glass. Other 
substances mixed with lead for enamels are barytes (barium sul- 
phate), sodium aluminate, calcium phosphate, arsenic and silver 
chlorid. Cast iron ware is liable to rust. To protect it it is first 
cleaned with dilute sulphuric acid, then a glaze is added a::d some 
powdered metallic color is blown over the surface. The ware is 
then heated to melt the glaze into the iron. In enameling iron bath- 
tubs, basins, sanitary closets, urinals, etc., white lead enamel is 
melted and pulverized so that it may be blown by compressed air in 
a uniform layer over the article to be enameled, which previously is 
heated to make it adhere. The dust thus blown is naturally a 
source of lead poisoning. 

DRY COLORS. Dry colors comprise such lead compounds as the 
carbonate, acetate, oxid and chrome or yellow lead. 

"PUTTY POWDER." Putty powder is three-fourths red lead and 
one-fourth tin. It is moistened and used on a wheel to polish cut 
glass. 

LEAD ACETATE. Litharge, when dissolved in vinegar, crystal- 
lizes into lead acetate or sugar of lead, which is used chiefly by dyers 
of textiles, in wall paper colors, in varnish, and for sanitary sup- 
plies. It is added sometimes to silk and linen thread to increase its 
weight, consequently seamstresses who form the habit of constantly 



216 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

biting the ends of threads when sewing have exceptionally been 
known to acquire lead poisoning. 

LEAD CHROMATES. Lead chromates, yellow, orange and red, 
are made by a wet process in which there is little dust and conse- 
quently little risk, but wool and cotton yarn dyed by these colors 
may disseminate poisonous dust when freely handled, and, according 
to a Bulletin of the United States Labor Bureau, 1903, many serious 
cases of poisoning are known as results of the above-mentioned color 
dust. 

"Thus Leopold reports a case of . severe lead poisoning in a 
weaver's family which had worked with yarn dyed in chromate of 
lead. To a nine-weeks-old child, which was exposed to the influence 
of the dust in the room in which the yarn was used, the poisoning 
was fatal. Considerable danger also threatens those employed in 
the manufacture and consumption of the other yellow lead colors, 
as cassel yellow (yellow oxychlorid of lead), and naphs yellow (an- 
timonate of lead), which, however, since the introduction of chromate 
of lead, plays but a small part in the industries." 

LEAD NITRATE AND IODID. These are used in calico printing, 
but, like many other minor lead salts, their employment is limited in 
the industries and rarely productive of harm. 

Dr. Alice Hamilton, in her exhaustive investigation of lead 
poisoning in Illinois, places the toxicity of lead compounds in the 
following order, commencing with the most serious : lead carbonate, 
acetate lead, lead oxid and suboxid, red lead and litharge, chrome 
yellow and green, metallic lead. . 

General Etiology SEX. Females are always more susceptible 
to lead poisoning than males. They have the symptoms earlier and 
acquire them with less dosage than men working under analogous 
conditions. Females^ too, are more likely to present nervous phe- 
nomena, and the mental symptoms of hysteria and encephalopathy 
than the colic and othe\" manifestations. Encephalopathy, for in- 
stance, is two or three tiW es more common among them. Woolsey 
gave the percentage of plir, m bi s m among lead workers in Stoke-on- 
Trent, England, in 1898, a^. 4.9 P er cent, of men and 12.4 per cent. 
of women employed. In foreign countries women formerly were 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 217 

much employed in lead mines, lead refineries, white lead works, 
pottery glazing and other extra-hazardous work. Much of this work 
has now been prohibited for women by law. In this country, where 
women have never been employed in many of the extremely labori- 
ous and dangerous trades, lead poisoning is less common among 
them. Dr. Hamilton found only 18 women out of 578 victims of 
plumbism. In my personal series of 268 cases there was only one 
woman. Dr. Hamilton's reported Illinois cases were those of women 
employed in "polishing type with emery, making car-seals, dusting 
lead colors on litho-transfers, labeling paint cans in an atmosphere 
of white lead dust, working with aluminum foil, making artificial 
flowers, wrapping cigars in tinfoil; one was a commercial artist." 

Women are more liable than men, when working in dusty lead 
trades such as pottery polishing, to carry lead dust home in their hair 
and clothing and thus distribute it in their own rooms. 

AGE. Dr. M. Allen Starr, of New York, has reported two cases 
of lead paralysis, one of which was fatal, in young children of a 
painter who were permitted to play with paint; and children in 
general, when exposed to lead poisoning, are extremely susceptible 
to it. 

In the copper mines of Queensland the ore contains much lead, 
and children who work there inhale lead dust, with the result that 
plumbism is exceedingly common among them. A. Turner, in the 
British Medical Journal of April 10, 1909, reported 262 such cases 
presenting at the Brisbane Hospital in a single year. Such children 
present marked gastro-intestinal disorders, nephritis, paralyses, in- 
cluding oculomotor types, and convulsions. 

Young persons are more susceptible than adults to lead en- 
cephalopathy, and young children are especially prone to paraplegia 
from plumbism. 

SEASON. Lead poisoning is more serious in winter than in sum- 
mer, in so far as it affects indoor workmen, for in winter windows 
and doors are kept closed and fumes and dust stagnate. Laureck 
claims that 71 per cent, of cases arise in winter and 29 in sum- 
mer in Austria, but no such striking difference has been observed in 
this country. Several French authors, on the other hand, claim 



218 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

that in France lead poisoning is almost twice as common in the 
midsummer months as at other seasons. This they attribute to 
greater thirst, which induces wine drinking, the cheaper grades of 
wine being clarified by lead or stored in leaden casks. 

IDIOSYNCRASY. Personal susceptibility to lead poisoning varies 
greatly. There are persons, especially painters, who can work with 
lead products for many years without presenting any subjective 
symptoms of poisoning. Others among their fellow workmen, with 
the same degree of exposure and approximately the same habits, are 
very easily affected. Hirt maintains that about 20 per cent, of all 
workmen are so easily poisoned by lead that they should never be 
permitted to enter the lead trades at all. 

A case of serious plumbism in a workman employed only three 
weeks in a white lead bed is cited in Bulletin No. 44, 1903, of the 
United States Labor Bureau, and there are many other cases on 
record where very short exposure to lead in various forms has re- 
sulted in like manner. 

ALCOHOLISM. The constant use of strong alcoholic beverages 
tends to lessen the resistance of the organism to many poisons, and 
particularly is this true in regard to lead. Many of the lesions 
caused by lead poisoning, such as arteriosclerosis, nephritis and 
neuritis, are closely akin to those caused by alcohol, and it is natural 
that the two poisons should possess strong synergystic action. Cesa- 
Bianchi has demonstrated experimentally in animals what he terms 
the "cooperation between the effects of alcohol and the lesions pro- 
duced by lead." ("Atti del Congresso di Medica Interna," 1910.) 

TOBACCO. Chewing tobacco, which is usually carried in the 
pocket of the lead worker, becomes soiled there, and when, by be- 
grimed fingers, it is conveyed to the mouth, lead is certain to enter 
the system. In European countries the prohibition against tobacco 
chewing while at work is very rigidly enforced, but in this country 
foremen often encourage its use on the ground that chewing it cleans 
the teeth and expectoration rids the mouth of dust. 

Especially Hazardous Lead Occupations in Detail. MINING. Sir 
Thomas Oliver, in his classical Report on Industrial Lead Poisoning 
in Europe, made for Bulletin No. 95 of the United States Bureau of 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 219 

Labor, 1911, states positively that "men mining lead ore, such as 
galena or sulphid, do not suffer from plumbism." This refers to the 
British industry, for he goes on to say : 

"The freedom of the British lead miner is due to the fact that 
lead is present in the ore in almost a pure metallic state, whereas in 
some of the Italian mines and in those at Broken Hill, in Australia, 
the lead is found in the form of a carbonate, and, in consequence, 
the miners have suffered from some of the most serious symptoms of 
plumbism. The unloading of heavy volcanic lead ore from a ship 
at a British port was followed by seven cases of plumbism among 
the men. Such ore ought always to be well watered first." 

SMELTING. Lead smelting gives rise often to most acute forms 
of lead intoxication, as the fumes from the molten lead ma"y be 
inhaled in such quantity as to become almost immediately fatal. 
Many serious cases of poisoning are recorded as occurring within 
five or six weeks of beginning this work. Dr. Hamilton obtained 
the statement from physicians in Illinois in 1910 that in the previous 
three years they had seen an average of 270 cases a year in three large 
smelting plants. Many of the workmen employed in this unskilled 
labor are ignorant foreign peasants, Slavs, Italians or others. They 
speak little English, cannot read regulations, and receive no preven- 
tive instructions. They become ill, quit work and disappear, so 
that statistics regarding plumbism among them are much more likely 
to be understated than overstated. In one Illinois lead plant em- 
ploying 450 to 600 men from 20 to 40 per cent, dropped out every 
pay day. (Hamilton.) The flue dust collects in places to a depth 
of several feet, and is removed in buckets by men who enter through 
manholes. Oliver found among the Derbyshire smelters, the flue 
cleaners, often after a few hours' work, had severe headache and 
vomiting, obliging them to quit work. The shovelers who feed the 
lead ore to the furnaces easily acquire tremors and paralyses. The 
fumes from the molten lead as it runs from the smelter may be so 
dense that a workman may inhale as much almost as a grain an hour 
of lead if he is exposed to them. The dross and slag, while hot, emit 
similarly dangerous fumes, particularly in the reverberatory type of 
furnace. 



220 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Apart from the volatile fumes, smelting works are always satu- 
rated with lead dust derived from breaking up the ore and slag, 
moving lead ingots, the condensation of fumes, etc. 

In the Austro-Hungarian lead smelting industry much trouble 
has arisen from the poisoning of cattle grazing near the smelting 
chimneys, although the flues leading to them may be more than a 
mile in length, to favor deposit of lead dust. The dust of the fumes 
from the smelters contains "about 30 per cent, of metallic lead, 
together with lead oxid and a variable proportion of sulphur, arsenic 
and other admixtures." (Oliver.) 

In illustration of the fatal hazard of work with molten lead, Dr. 
John B. Andrews cites the following case (Bulletin No. 95, United 
States Bureau of Labor, 1912) : 

"The workman of the death-certificate classification Case No. 50 
was traced to a factory where for 18 years he had operated a lead 
pipe machine and at intervals had polished shot with black lead. 
Melted lead here flowed from a kettle overhead and was conducted 
through an open cylinder to the pipe machine or press through which 
the lead was forced under great pressure in the making of ordinary 
lead pipe. The man in operating the press stood directly over the 
molten lead and also breathed the dust which arose as the dross, 
when skimmed from the surface of the melted lead in the high 
kettle, was thrown into a barrel on the floor. The polishing of shot 
was particularly dusty on account of the use of graphite, small 
particles of which are so light that they rise and float through the 
air upon the slightest disturbance." 

Solder casting is an especially hazardous lead trade. One of 
my patients who had thus been employed died in Bellevue Hospital 
from cerebral hemorrhage caused by an early arteriosclerosis. 

WHITE LEAD MANUFACTURE. In the whole United States are 
25 white lead factories. In the 16 months following January 1, 
1910, Dr. Alice Hamilton found in 23 of these factories 358 well- 
established cases of lead poisoning, among which 16 deaths occurred. 
In one factory alone there were 60 cases of poisoning. More than 
one a week ! The majority of cases, moreover, developed within two 
months of exposure. The exact time could not always be deter- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 221 

mined, but in 61 out of 89 cases symptoms developed within that 
brief period. One case developed in less than a week and 28 in 
less than a fortnight. Two cases of this series are so striking in 
showing the utter and typical neglect of the workingman that they 
are here quoted in full from the Bulletin of the United States Bureau 
of Labor, 1911, selected from a considerable number of similar 
cases : 

"No. 1. V. O., Italian, speaking no English. He worked for 
36 days in the stripping gang of a new, very well-built factory. No- 
body gave him any instructions nor explained to him the dangers of 
the work and the precautions he must take. He never saw a respir- 
ator and did not know there were such things or that he had a right 
to ask for one. The stack men had only cold water to wash with, 
no soap or towels, and as the lunch period is only 30 minutes, they 
did not trouble to wash. He used to eat his lunch sitting on the tan 
bark in the stack house. He wore his usual clothes to work in. 
There was a great deal of dust in the stack, especially on windy 
days. One day an agonizing colic came upon him suddenly and he 
fell to the ground. He had not known that there was such a sick- 
ness as lead poisoning till an Italian doctor told him that he had it 
and sent him to the public hospital, where he remained for 2 weeks. 
After he returned home he had a relapse and was obliged to go back 
to the hospital. When seen, 3 months later, he was not yet strong 
enough to work. 

"No. 32. Negro, 50 years. He worked for 6 or 7 months in 
this same factory. He had always been strong up to this time, and 
during the first part of his employment he worked outside. But 
after about 2 months he was sent to work in a very dusty room, 
where the men frequently become poisoned in a few days' time. He 
worked there for 3 days, then became violently poisoned, and was 
sent to a private hospital. After he came out he went to work 
again, but he was ill and became morose and slightly deranged. 
He was then sent to the public hospital, the record of which shows 
that he was brought there in convulsions, and was later confined 
for a time in the insane wards. He is now said to be quite sane 
again and is working as a sailor." 



222 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Of the 16 fatal cases, 8 belonged to one factory, a very dusty 
place without washing facilities or medical care. 

White lead may produce poisoning very promptly in the ab- 
sence of any precautionary measures against it. For example, Dr. 
Hamilton reports the case of a young Bulgarian who "went to work 
in a lead factory the first week he arrived in Chicago, and was put 
to emptying pans of dry white lead. He was given no respirator 
and had no idea that he had a right to ask for one. Nobody told him 
the white dust on his hands and mustache was poisonous. He had 
only one suit of clothes and wore his working clothes home. He had a 
severe attack of lead poisoning at the end of five weeks." 

It is difficult to write calmly of such criminal neglect, for it 
cannot be characterized as ignorance in a matter so thoroughly and 
widely understood among manufacturers as lead poisoning. 

Cleaning out lead carbonate blue beds, transporting, packing, 
grinding and mixing this compound often give rise to very acute and 
serious symptoms. Frequently the workmen are attacked within 
5 or 6 weeks of beginning such work. In four white lead factories 
in Illinois Dr. Hamilton found records of 157 cases of lead poisoning 
which developed within three years. 

RED LEAD MANUFACTURE. Poisoning by red lead is even more 
hazardous than by white lead, but the number of men employed in 
its preparation is comparatively few, so that it fails to attract as 
much attention. 

Oliver found that, in the 19 British red lead factories, the per- 
centage of poison cases among the workmen was from 27.8 to 41.7 
during the 10 years prior to 1910. Sixteen cases occurred among 
common laborers merely employed to sweep the floors. 

PAINTING. Paint is usually composed of 90 parts of lead car- 
bonate with 10 parts of oil, to which pigments and sometimes turpen- 
tine subsequently are added. 

By far the largest number of cases of plumbism are found among' 
painters because they constitute so large a class of workmen; they 
mix and handle so much lead and oil, which makes it adhesive, and 
because they inhale or swallow the dust of old paint which they 
scrape or rub down with sandpaper or pumice., They rarely suffer 



TOXIC METALS AND TSEIR COMPOUNDS 223 

from acute plumbism, however, but often from slow poisoning, which 
may operate through many years. 

In fact, painters, if they do not sandpaper dry paint, do not 
often develop serious poisoning, i. e., a degree of poisoning which 
incapacitates them from work, in less than four or five years, and I 
have records of many who had no symptoms for 20 years, and a few 
for 35 and even 40 years. If they continue long enough in the 
trade, however, it is exceptional for them to escape poisoning, par- 
ticularly as they come to regard themselves as immune and grow 
careless in the matter of precautions. For example, they will hold 
the dirty handles of paint brushes in the mouth and rub lead putty 
in the palm of the hand. Recently a young man of only twenty- 
three years of age presented himself at my clinic with most advanced 
arteriosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy and a loud Flint murmur, the 
result of working with lead paints since he was thirteen years of age. 
I have lately seen another case in a boy of thirteen years. 

During the past eight years we have had in the hospital services 
in Bellevue and the Presbyterian Hospital, and in my Out-Patient 
Medical Clinic in the Cornell University Medical College, two hun- 
dred and sixty-eight cases of serious lead poisoning arising from 
various trades, but nearly 75 per cent, of these were furnished by 
painters. In Paris, among 300 hospital cases of plumbism, 233 were 
painters. Of the 125 cases of lead poisoning reported to the New 
York State Department of Labor in the year 1912, 95 were among 
painters in different trades. Dr. Hamilton studied the histories of 
1,009 painters in Chicago, of whom 185 had had plumbism, 72 
kidney disease, 77 "rheumatism" and 24 gastric disorders. ("Hygiene 
of the Painter's Trade," Bulletin, U. S. Dept. of Labor Statistics, 
No. 120, May 13, 1913.) 

Painters often are obliged to work in unfinished buildings where 
water and heating supply has not yet been installed. As a result 
they have no suitable facilities for washing or changing overalls, and 
consequently are very apt to contaminate their food with lead at the 
noon luncheon hour. Sandpapering the interiors of sleeping cars 
and drawing-room cars is extremely hazardous, especially the ceiling 
work, where the dust falls down into the face of the operator. Dr. 



224 DISEASES .DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Hamilton refers to three cases of plumbism which developed after 
four weeks' exposure in this manner. 

Sir Thomas Oliver has met with cases of colic and wrist drop 
in men who painted iron coach frames which were heated. 

A very fertile source of lead poisoning concerns the new indus- 
try of automobile painting in which sandpapering figures as part of 
the process. 

In Germany and Belgium the sandpapering of dry paint in manu- 
facturing processes is illegal, and in England also it is generally 
customary to moisten the paint. But in this country, which is usu- 
ally the follower rather than the leader in matters hygienic, the haz- 
ardous dry method is still in vogue. 

The use of pumice stone for smoothing painted surfaces is pro- 
hibited in Belgium by law. The lead thus rubbed off is in the form 
of an oleate, which is quite readily absorbed. 

The burning process applied in removal of old paint is scarcely 
less hazardous, for fumes of melted lead are evolved. Caustic 
potash is sometimes used for washing old paint, but this is very 
irritating to the hands, especially if any abrasions exist. 

In the making of enameled iron plates and hollow ware, such 
as pots and kettles, etc., a powdered paint which contains about 25 
per cent, of lead, and frequently powdered glass, is applied by sift- 
ing over the ware. In stenciling for the painting of signs red and 
other forms of lead are used. 

In the enameling process as applied to iron sheets or receptacles, 
lead, arsenic and antimony are used. 

POTTERY GLAZING. Pottery glazing is a fertile source of plumb- 
ism. This hazard is fully described under the heading Pottery 
Making. 

MANUFACTURE OF STORAGE BATTERIES OR ELECTRIC ACCUMU- 
LATORS. In the making of storage batteries perforated or grooved 
metallic lead plates have their openings or grooves filled with a pasty 
mixture of red lead oxid and sulphuric acid. The work is dusty and 
extremely hazardous, both from dust and the adhesive paste. (Fig. 
38.) The pasters sometimes are provided with glass 'screens, behind 
which they sit, passing the hands through canvas slits covering holes 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 225 

in the screens. In this manner they may handle the plates with 

some diminution of hazard, but the protection is far from complete. 

In many battery works fully 30 per cent, of the men employed in 




FIG. 38. LEAD WORK IN THE MANUFACTURE OF STORAGE BATTERIES. Red 
oxid of lead and litharge are mixed together. The employee wears a respira- 
tor. He was unwilling to wear long-wristed gloves. Note the crowded, 
dirty, ill-ventilated room. (Reproduced with permission of Dr. William C. 
Hanson, Massachusetts State Board of Health, Aug., 1910.) 

rubbing in the paste have acquired plumbism, which is liable to be 
of acute and very serious type. Dr. Alice Hamilton reported the 
case of a battery worker "who became violently ill at the end of 10 
days." He was a "newly arrived Russian Jew who was set to work- 



226 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

ing with the red lead paste and used to moisten his fingers in his 
mouth as he worked, because he had never been told that the stuff 
was dangerous." 

In 1909, in a storage battery establishment in New York City, 
two men died within a few days of each other from acute plumbism, 
and many of the men developed symptoms of lead poisoning within a 
month of their beginning work, but, as the labor was unskilled, it 
was replaced without difficulty. After a fire this originally most 
dangerous plant was replaced by a modern sanitary one and cases 
have ceased to arise. 

Twenty-one cases of plumbism from making accumulators oc- 
curred among the 125 cases of lead poisoning reported to the New 
York State Department of Labor in the year 1911-12, and E. E. 
Pratt found Y cases originating in a single factory in New York City. 

In England, in eleven years prior to 1910, there were reported 
among makers of electric accumulators 317 cases of plumbism and 6 
deaths. 

The plates are soldered together, a blowpipe being used for the 
purpose, and, in addition to the fumes thus evolved, much lead dust 
flies about while setting the plates in lead-lined boxes or jars. Usu- 
ally a lead line may be found in half the men employed, and in 
some works 50 per cent, of the workmen become ill within a year. 
(I. Kaup.) One of Dr. Oliver's patients became ill with plumbism 
after 10^ days' work as a paster of the "grids." 

In the Milan Clinic, in 1911, among 29 cases derived from elec- 
trical industries were 4 cases of plumbism from working in electric 
accumulators. (L. Carozzi.) 

HOLLOW TIN WARE MANUFACTURE. Hollow tin ware is some- 
times lined by a layer of molten lead and tin which is swished 
around the inside of the pot or kettle while it is held over a furnace. 
The work should be done only under a well-fitting hood with strong 
suction draught. Dippers of this type of ware are usually an anemic, 
sickly set of men and plumbism is common among them. 

LEAD SHOT MANUFACTURE. Lead shot is made of a molten com- 
pound of lead with arsenic which is dropped through sieves of dif- 
ferent sizes at the top of a tall tower into water at the base, which 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 227 

solidifies the round lead drops. The shot are then mixed with 
graphite and polished in revolving drums. 

FILE MAKING. In cutting amber articles and in cutting the ribs 
of files the articles are imbedded in a block of lead, which offers the 
proper degree of resistance or rebound when the cutting chisel is 
struck by the hammer. Much lead dust, besides iron filings, is thus 
produced, and the workmen have the habit of moistening the fingers 
in the mouth to obtain a firmer grasp upon the cutting instrument. 
Thus they both swallow and inhale much lead dust. Wooden or tin 
blocks may be used to replace the lead, but are less satisfactory. 
The increasing use of file making machinery is doing much to lessen 
the frequent cases of lead poisoning which characterize this trade, 
but as the machines strike from 400 to 1,000 blows per minute, they 
raise considerable lead dust. 

Dr. White examined 100 English file cutters and found 74 with 
a lead line on the gums, 28 with colic and 20 with palsy. The mor- 
tality of this trade is excessive. Leaning over the work and raising 
the lead dust by constant hammering constitutes the special risk. 
Sometimes 3,000 or 4,000 lines must be made on a single file. 

According to Sprenger, among 93 file makers in Berlin more 
than 5 per cent, were afflicted with lead poisoning within a little 
more than two years of work. The workmen sometimes strew sand 
on the benches to prevent the slipping of the file bed. The ham- 
mering of the files raises considerable sand dust. 

For hardening the files are sometimes plunged into a molten lead 
bath. In Berlin the experiment was made of substituting tin cush- 
ions for lead, with the result that after two years' trial 55 workmen 
who used them remained in good health, but of the remaining 93, out 
of a total of 148 file cutters, 55 acquired lead poisoning. (Oliver.) 
File cutters also frequently acquire tuberculosis and chronic nephri- 
tis. Metallic lead slabs are used as supports in cutting certain 
articles of leather manufacture. 

MANUFACTURING WITH ALLOYS OF LEAD. Many alloys of lead 
are used in minor trades, as in making organ pipes, artificial fruit 
and flowers for decoration, tin foil, toy tin soldiers, etc., but cases of 
lead poisoning among workmen so employed very rarely arise. 



For diamond cutting the stones are Embedded in a molten alloy 
of 60 per cent, lead and 40 per cent, tin, so that they can be fixed 
and polished by iron wheels rotating several thousand times a minute. 
A grinding powder of lead is also used. The workmen are thus 
subject to fumes from the molten lead, tin, iron and diamond dust, 
and fumes of various varnishes. They thus may acquire colic, 
paralysis and other symptoms of plumbism. 

Litharge is much used in glass making, owing to the ready com- 
bination which it forms with the silicates. It is thus used in making 
false gems, stained and enamel glass, crystal glass and optical lenses. 
As much of this glass ware must be ground in finishing, lead is dis- 
seminated in the dust and inhaled. The preliminary fusion proc- 
esses also give rise to toxic lead fumes. Litharge is further used 
often in 50 per cent, strength in furniture lacquer. Subsequent rub- 
bing with .sandpaper and pumice produces fine dust which is highly 
toxic. 

Brush and hair workers make use of a mixture of litharge, vine- 
gar and water to dye horsehair and bristles black, for the natural 
sulphur of the hair forms a black lead sulphate. Such hair is capable 
of disseminating lead dust, and upholsterers and saddlers occasion- 
ally have been poisoned by it. 

Lead superoxid is used in making friction matches, but does not 
produce serious risk of poisoning. 

In the textile industries lead has various uses. Chief among these 
is the weighting of silk, lace, embroidery, etc. 

It is also employed in making white gloves, shoes and straw hats. 

In Vienna, of 41 samples of black silk thread analyzed, 32 con- 
tained lead, and of 12 samples of lace, 10 contained it. The lead is 
applied originally in solution as an acetate, but soon oxidizes in the 
air to a dusty powder. In foreign countries much weaving, spin- 
ning, dyeing, lace making, etc., is still done in the homes of the 
workers, a custom which in this country at the present date is almost 
unknown. But apart from the dyeing of silk, lace, etc., there is 
danger to seamstresses in working upon such material, and lead 
poisoning has frequently been discovered among them. 

TYPESETTING AND FEINTING. Type metal is an alloy composed 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 229 

usually of 75 per cent, lead, 20 per cent, antimony and 5 per cent, 
tin. The tin is inert, but the large percentage of antimony pres- 
ent has given rise to the belief of late years that many of the symp- 
toms which affect type founders and typesetters are due more to that 
metal than lead. As they are often taken into the system together 
in considerable quantity, it is not always easy to separate the clini- 
cal findings, as many symptoms of poisoning are identical with the 
two metals, although lead produces the greater variety. 

Type founders and makers of stereotype plates are obliged to 
work over the fumes given off from pots of melted lead. 

Printers suffer in varying degree from lead poisoning. In many 
large printing establishments the men suffer very little from it, 
although they work for many years. In others examples of it are 
constantly observed. Much depends upon cleanliness and ventila- 
tion, and dry sweeping is a most pernicious process in this extensive 
industry. 

The use of lye for cleaning the surface of the type sometimes 
irritates the hands, causing erosions of the skin, through which it is 
possible for lead to be absorbed. This latter danger, however, is a 
very minor one, compared with all the other risks of the trade. 
Tanquerel found the ratio of lead poisoning among type founders 
to be four times greater than that of typesetters, and Hirt gives 
practically the same figures. 

Printers will sometimes hold type in their mouths while setting 
or sorting it, or moisten their fingers in their mouths to enable them 
to seize the type better. The water in which printers wash their 
hands was found by Dr. Van Eyk to contain from 6 to 15 mg. of 
lead per man. (Oliver.) 

Dust from type cases has been analyzed by Rueszahegyi, who 
discovered in it 57.7 mg. of lead, 186.8 mg. of antimony and a small 
quantity of arsenic. Sorting old, dust-covered type is always hazard- 
ous. The type are sometimes polished with emery, by girls who 
are given this easy but dangerous employment. 

The sort of plumbism which mainly affects printers is very 
insidious and of the arteriosclerotic variety, colic and palsy being 
less common among them than in painters. Many of them have 



230 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

chronic nephritis and cardiac hypertrophy, and cerebral hemorrhage 
may develop at a comparatively early age. 

It has often been stated that printers have a high rate of mortal- 
ity from tuberculosis, due to the inhalation of dust impregnated 
with lead. Dr. James A. Miller, in 1908, examined 203 members 
of Typographical Union No. 6 in New York City, and found that 
17 per cent, of them had tuberculosis, but he states: 

"After very careful examination it was found that one half of 
them had cured tuberculosis; they had had tuberculosis, left their 
employment, took care of themselves, returned to their trade, and 
had no relapse. The knowledge they gained enabled them to return 
to their trade and keep well. It would seem, therefore, that the 
habits of the printers rather than their occupation were at fault." 

European printers universally have a very high death rate from 
tuberculosis, despite the attention given to prevention of this dis- 
ease during the past two decades. This death rate is so out of pro- 
portion to that of tuberculosis among other lead workers that it is 
explainable only on the ground that type dust is sharp and mechani- 
cally irritating as well as poisonous, or that the combination of the 
lead with antimony is particularly injurious to the lungs. 

The general use of linotype machines (Fig. 39) in large printing 
establishments, which largely does away with the handling of individ- 
ual type in setting or distributing, has accomplished much in reducing 
the number of cases of plumbism among the workmen. It is only 
in the melting and recasting processes by which the type are remade 
that there is any special hazard. 

Other metals might be used in the form of alloys to replace lead 
in type making, but their cost or greater difficulty in handling make 
their general substitution prohibitive. Printers are subject to ben- 
zene poisoning, the substance used to clean the ink from type. (The 
effects of this poison are described on page 312.) Antimony poi- 
soning also occurs among those who handle type metal. 

PLUMBING. Plumbers use much less lead at present than thirty 
years ago, when waste pipes, traps and joints were universally made 
of lead. At present they are made of iron or brass chiefly, so the 
only hazard is in the dust from filing or handling the small amount 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS, 



231 



of red lead paste used to cement pipe connections. As these are 
comparatively slight risks, plumbisin among plumbers is becoming 
more and more infrequent. A pernicious habit of chewing bits of

Hazard: chronic lead poisoning. (From the Illinois State Department of 
Factory Inspection.) 

lead or solder is quite common among plumbers, who use it when 
their supply of chewing tobacco gives out. Sometimes lead poison- 
ing arises in this manner. 

ENGRAVING. Artists employed in engraving establishments, in 
retouching photographs, often form the habit of moistening with 
their lips the fine brushes which they use. They usually are not 
informed that they are using lead paint, or are definitely told that 
they are not, but, even when they know it, it is difficult to prevent 



233 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

them from forming the habit of mouth moistening. Dr. Hamilton 
found that white lead was in use in all except 4 of 74 establish- 
ments of this kind visited in Illinois, and there were 15 cases of 
plumbism in them. These artists also make use of a compressed 
air spray of white lead paint to cover the surface on which they 
are working with a thin, uniform layer, and subsequently the com- 
pressed air jet is employed to brush away any excess of dried 
paint. 

LITHO-TRANSFER WORK. In litho-transfer work dry colors are 
ground and dusted onto paper which is especially made to hold them, 
very much as flour is dusted from a sieve. The colors are then trans- 
ferred by contact to pottery or other ware. The girls who are 
largely employed in this color dusting sometimes do the work behind 
glass screens, passing the hands through holes covered by canvas 
flaps, but the risk is still very great. 

Sir Thomas Oliver states that some of the severest cases of lead 
poisoning he has met with were in boys under 18 years of age, em- 
ployed in litho-transfer work. 

In electrotyping particles both of lead and arsenic have been 
detected in the dust of the workrooms. 

Gilders use a paste of white and red lead mixed with turpentine 
and glue, as a foundation for the gold leaf or gold paint to be 
applied. 

Unusual Sources of Lead Poisoning. False pearls contain lead 
silicate. They are polished upon steel wheels revolving at great 
speed, and considerable lead dust is associated with the work. E. 
Gaucher and H. Bernard have reported a number of cases of plumb- 
ism acquired in this trade. 

White lead is sometimes rubbed into white felt hats and into 
white gloves to cover seams. 

Dr. Hamilton refers to the cases of two men who became "leaded" 
through the habit of "holding lead-covered nails in their mouths 
while shingling roofs." 

In the manufacture of wire and wire cloth the wire is hardened 
by being drawn through hot crude oil, and subsequently is drawn 
through molten lead which is contained in receptacles inside of fur- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 233 

naces. From the latter lead fumes are evolved and constitute con- 
siderable hazard for the men who feed the furnaces. 

One would scarcely associate lead poisoning with embroidery, 
yet a number of cases have been traced to this industry. For making 
embroidery patterns on a large scale stencils are used, and the mark- 
ing should be done with inert substances such as powdered starch 
and gum-arabic. White lead powder, however, is sometimes em- 
ployed, and the young girls who use it are very subject to lead 
poisoning. 

Soda water syphons have tops made of block tin which contains 
lead. In London, in 1911, a physician's wife died from lead poison- 
ing resulting from drinking soda water from such syphons, which 
was proved at inquest to contain the proportion of 1/20 to 1/16 grain 
of lead per gallon. One-fiftieth grain per gallon is considered 
poisonous. 

Remelting the leaden sheets used for lining tea chests has been 
known to cause plumbism. 

A case of plumbism is reported in Sozial Teclinik (1912, vol. 
iv, no. 2), occurring in an Austrian painter employed in retouching 
in an art photographic establishment. Despite repeated warning, he 
kept on moistening with his lips a brush dipped in lead colors. 

Another case similarly reported occurred in a woman who made 
use of a hair dye containing lead. 

Sir Thomas Oliver reports: "Two cases of plumbism occurred 
recently in shipbuilding yards owing to the custom of the men 
using white lead paint to mark off on the iron plates the sites of the 
holes preparatory to boring them with the punching machine. It 
is difficult to see why such unnecessary risk should have been run, 
since whiting or zinc white mixed with oil would have served the 
purpose equally well." He also cites the case of a woman who ac- 
quired double "drop-wrist" from washing the overalls of a house 
painter. Oliver recovered lead from the washtub water. 

Fresh paint in closed sleeping apartments may cause serious 
poisoning by inhalation. On a French warship a number of cases 
of colic were accounted for in this manner. Oliver found lead in 
the urine of a physician who slept in a newly painted house and was 



234 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

made ill by plumbism for several mouths. He cites several similar 
cases, and states that lead is contained in the turpentine fumes from 
the paint, as determined by spectroscopic examination. He refers 
also to two cases of serious plurnbism which he traced to sleeping in 
rooms lined with wall paper which was found to contain lead. Dr. 
Charron has found similar cases in France. Deep yellow chrome 
and bright red papers were found to contain the most lead, and he 
poisoned animals by lining their cages with such paper. Pregnant 
guinea pigs aborted, and the fetuses contained traces of lead in their 
organs. 

In Vienna, in 1906, several cases of plumbism occurred in women 
and girls who made fringe of silk which had been weighted with 
lead acetate. (Teleki.) 

Edsall quotes two cases of lead poisoning in dentists who had 
the habit of mixing a lead amalgam in the palm of the hands. 

A case of plumbism occurred in a drug clerk who was employed 
for some time in making lead plaster. 

A case of plumbism was reported in 1912 by G. H. Snover, 
occurring in New York State, in a girl of 16 who, while employed 
in soldering condensed milk cans, was accustomed to hold sticks of 
solder in the mouth. 

A case of lead poisoning was reported to me occurring in a rail- 
way track walker. He carried leaded torpedoes in his pocket to- 
gether with his "quid" of tobacco and thence conveyed lead into his 
mouth. 

It is not essential to be an actual worker in lead to acquire plumb- 
ism, and such workers sometimes needlessly expose their fellow work- 
men to hazard. For example, in the Puget Sound Navy Yard a 
man employed in laying iron floor plates in the engine room of a 
battleship became "leaded" in a week because he was in some man- 
ner exposed while painters were at work in the vessel's hold near by. 
Among other symptoms he had a toxic amblyopia. 

Although not an occupational condition, it is interesting in this 
connection to note that a number of cases of lead paralysis and some 
few of lead colic have resulted from absorption of lead introduced 
into various parts of the body. Thus Eibierre and Flandin reported 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 235 

in La presse medicate (June 14, 1911) the case of a man who re- 
covered from a gunshot wound of the lung. The carbonic acid in 
the lung caused solution of some of the lead shot as a bicarbonate, 
which, on being absorbed, caused multiple paralyses. Lead was also 
detected in pus from the wound. 

Brouvin has reported a case of poisoning by lead shot, and Ruva 
reported lead poisoning following the swallowing of ten shot grains. 

L. Lewin reports (Arch, fur klin. Chirurg., xciv, no. 4) a num- 
ber of cases of plumbism from swallowing shot or having a leaden 
bullet lodge in the tissues. In one case a woman was acutely poi- 
soned from a shot which became wedged between the teeth. Curtillet 
and Lombard have reported the case of a boy of 15 years who died 
with symptoms of acute lead poisoning 25 days after receiving a 
charge of bird shot in the arm. Excessive edema which followed 
the injury, they think, facilitated solution and dissemination of the 
lead. 

Diachylon lead pills have at times been taken by women desiring 
to produce abortion, but, like all of the so-called abortifacients, they 
act more irritatingly upon other organs than the uterus, especially 
upon the kidneys, so that very nearly fatal results have more than 
once been observed from their promiscuous use. The abortion some- 
times produced in this manner, or by any form of chronic plumbism, 
probably arises from the lead attacking the embryo directly, for it 
has been found in its tissues, but it may, also, cause more or less 
uterine spasm. 

Pathology and Morbid Anatomy. RETENTION OF LEAD IN THE 
SYSTEM. Lead and its products enter the body through the lungs 
and by swallowing, and very slightly through the skin, as illustrated 
by the medicinal lead plaster, "lead and opium wash," etc. English 
writers favor the inhalation theory ; Germans, the deglutition theory. 
Probably in very dusty lead trades both processes occur. Where lead 
fumes are given off, naturally inhalation predominates, but dust 
probably is more often conveyed to the mouth either directly in the 
air or by contact with food or tobacco put into the mouth. 

The lead salts, such as the nitrate, chlorid and acetate, which are 
soluble in water, are those which are most readily absorbed by the 



236 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

skin, although it is believed that the fatty acids of the perspiration 
may convert some of the insoluble into soluble lead salts. 

When lead or its compounds enters the stomach soluble lead chlorid 
is formed by the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, and is readily 
absorbed. The presence of proteid food in the stomach tends to 
use up the acid and leave any lead products which may have been 
swallowed to pass undissolved into the intestine. The presence of 
albumin, moreover, forms with lead chlorid a dense coagulum, which 
is but slightly soluble. Hence, it is argued by Oliver, the chief mode 
of entrance of lead into the blood from the alimentary canal is not 
as an albuminate but as a chlorid. Peptone acts similarly to albu- 
min in checking lead absorption. This line of reasoning explains 
why milk drinking, previous to or during working hours, is often 
prophylactic of plumbism. Lead salts dissolved in drinking water 
may form a bicarbonate or be converted into the diffusible chlorid. 
In some lead plants the employees are given a pint of milk or cup 
of cocoa with bread for a simple breakfast before beginning work, 
which has been found a good preventive of lead poisoning, at least, 
in so far as it might be acquired through swallowing instead of 
through dust inhalation. This is especially important for foreign 
workmen, who often have been accustomed to breakfast in the middle 
of the morning instead of before beginning work. Experiments 
made by Sir Thomas Oliver with a dialyzer showed that neither 
bile nor pancreatic juice alone aids the solution or diffusibility of 
lead carbonate. Hence it seems probable that, if lead fails of con- 
version to the chlorid in the stomach, it is not likely to be absorbed 
from the intestine, but is probably eliminated quite unaltered in the 
stools. 

According to Mr. Kenneth Goadby (Jour, of Hygiene, vol. ix, 
no. 1, April, 1909), the solubility of lead salts in the gastric juice 
varies so much that the sulphate is almost twice as soluble as the 
carbonate and oxid. It is a popular notion among lead workers 
that a weak sulphuric acid lemonade, slightly sweetened, drunk in 
the workshop, causes solution of any lead which may have entered 
the system, and hence favors its elimination. Large quantities of 
fluid of any kind, such as beer, may aid in flushing the kidneys and 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 237 

alimentary canal, but there is no special advantage in the sulphuric 
lemonade. On the contrary, continued use of such acid, even though 
it be in weak solution, tends to impair digestion and corrode the 
teeth. 

Sir Thomas Oliver, in his Goulstonian lectures in 1891, pointed 
out that "lead carbonate which is inhaled as dust into the pulmonary 
alveoli is moistened by fluids rich in carbonic acid coming from the 
lungs, whereby the lead carbonate becomes converted into bicarbonate, 
which is fairly soluble." A similar change he suggests may take 
place in inhaled fumes of molten lead. 

Litharge or red lead is heavier as a powder than white lead, 
and when inhaled experimentally by animals gives rise to expulsive 
reflexes such as sneezing and coughing. Other authorities hold that 
in the body lead or its compounds in contact with albumin and the 
various secretions, either acid or alkaline, form soluble albuminates 
which are readily absorbed, mainly by the lymphatic system, but 
also by the bloodvessels. 

Prof. L. Devoto, in an essay on vascular and renal changes in 
saturnism ("Le alterazioni dei vasci, dei reni e delle articolazioni nel 
saturnismo chronico," 1911), finds that in some cases there is a 
preceding hyperchlorhydria, in others a chronic gastric catarrh 
which causes ventricular atony. Either of these conditions may favor 
the absorption of lead when swallowed. The elimination of lead 
through the kidneys, he states, causes vasoconstriction with retarda- 
tion of functional activity. This results in augmenting the uric 
acid in the blood, causing uricemia. In time a chronic indurative 
nephritis develops with moderate albuminuria and arteriosclerosis. 
The pathological changes are thus linked together in a natural 
sequence as follows : gastric catarrh and atony, renal irritation with 
vasoconstriction and uricemia, albuminuria and anemia, vascular 
hypertension, arteriosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy. The vascu- 
lar and blood changes result in arthritic and nerve lesions with atony 
and paresis of muscles. In some cases the uricemia results in the 
manifestations of gout, the sequence of events being : renal irritation, 
vasoconstriction, fibrosis of the kidney, retention of uric acid, and 
finally production of gout. Devoto thus regards chronic saturnism 



238 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

as a dyscrasia combining catarrh of the stomach, nephritis, articu- 
lar irritation and gout. 

According to Preti, writing of the catalytic action of lead upon 
the uropoietic system, lead behaves as a substance which disturbs the 
uropoietic fermentative functions, i. e., the uric acid formation, 
rather than by acting solely upon its elimination when formed 
through the kidneys. This he terms an endogenous uricemia, origi- 
nating in functional chemotaxic change, in distinction from a purely 
exogenous influence acting by inhibiting uric acid elimination after 
it is produced. Probably the discussion should include not solely 
uric acid, but the other products of proteid waste. 

Straub (Deutsche med. Woch., August 10, 1911) experimented 
in animals with subcutaneous injections of insoluble lead salts such 
as the carbonate and sulphate. Minute particles from time to time 
were absorbed and finally produced toxic symptoms of the central 
nervous system, but no excessive accumulation of lead was found in 
the organs most affected. 

Sir Thomas Oliver, in most of his personal cases which came 
to autopsy, found lead in the liver, kidneys, muscles and brain. In 
the brain in one instance as much as 99.7 milligrams was found, 
and 17.4 milligrams in the cerebellum, although usually only a 
mere trace is to be detected. 

In the kidney, in chronic plumbism, there may be atrophy of the 
connective tissue and glomeruli with hyalin degeneration of the 
vessels. In general the renal lesions of chronic nephritis are those 
of chronic interstitial nephritis, but acute plumbism, as when a vic- 
tim dies from inhaling concentrated lead fumes, may present an 
acute parenchymatous nephritis. Temporary albumjnuria may ap- 
pear in connection with each successive attack of lead colic in the 
same patient 

Heubel gave dogs various lead salts, and on analyzing their 
organs found it stored chiefly in the kidneys, liver and bones, very 
small traces only being observed in other organs or in the blood. 

Lead is deposited in the gums, and more rarely in the mucous 
membrane of the lips. 

It was for a long time taught that lead exhibited a selective action 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 239 

for certain groups of muscles which become paralyzed with greatest 
frequency. There is a modern tendency, however, to explain the 
matter on Edinger's exhaustion theory. This is that certain toxins 
have a general depressing effect upon the nerves and muscles of the 
whole body, and when fatigue or exhaustion from overuse of any 
group of muscles or any special nerves occurs in addition, these par- 
ticular groups first show the influence of the poison. Teleky has 
pointed out (Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Nervenheilkunde, 1909, xxxvii, 
234-304) that painters suffer most from paralysis of the pronators 
and extensors of the hands, muscles which are much used in their 
trade. 

In other trades similar relationship to overuse of particular 
groups of muscles may be shown. This is a plausible theory, but 
is open to so many exceptions that it should not be too readily 
adopted. Thus Oliver has reported cases of "drop-foot" in painters 
(See Fig. 43, page 252), as well as "drop-wrist," and the latter symp- 
tom may occur in other types of lead workers who do not exhaust any 
one group of muscles by special use. Fatigued muscles, it is well 
argued, are more likely to retain their waste products, thereby pos- 
sibly weakening their nerve endings and ultimately impairing their 
nutrition. It must be admitted that in porcelain painters, for ex- 
ample, and others whose trade requires constant use of the long ex- 
tensors of the fingers and the thumb muscles, it is these muscles 
which show early and most extensive atrophy. The main objection 
to the theory is that in many lead trades requiring excessive use of 
one hand both hands or arms become almost simultaneously paralyzed. 
The paralyzed muscles gradually waste and the reaction of degenera- 
tion is present. The nerves of the affected muscles show the lesions 
of interstitial neuritis with increase of the connective tissue frame- 
work and degeneration of the fibers, and it is the belief of Oliver 
that in the paralyzed limbs "the lesion is primarily started in the 
nervous system, which is the more vulnerable." In support of this 
view are researches of Bernhardt which show that, weight for weight, 
the muscles in lead poisoning contain less lead than other organs of 
the body, and that the paralyzed extensors contain no more than the 
unaffected flexors, and "there is nothing to prove that lead has a 



240 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

special predilection for any particular muscle or group of muscles." 
(Oliver.) 

Vulpian has attributed the radial nerve paralysis of plumbism 
to degeneration and atrophy of the ganglion cells of the spinal cord, 
but such lesions are rarely to be found. 

The encephalopathy arising from chronic lead poisoning has been 
much discussed. Harnach, as well as Sir Thomas Oliver, on the 
strength of autopsy findings which revealed traces of lead in the 
brain, inclines to attribute the direct cause to lead. Traube advo- 
cates the uremic theory, as in the cerebral cases the kidney functions 
are also disturbed. Others, like Rosenbaum and Heubel, believe the 
anemia to be the important factor. It would seem, however, that 
arteriosclerosis and degeneration of the cerebral vessels, restricting 
the normal brain circulation, are a sufficient explanation. 

According to Oliver, the organs of those dying from acute lead 
encephalopathy may appear normal to the naked eye, but the brain 
may be pale and edematous as it is in uremia, or it may be pale, 
firm and shrunken. In one of his cases the dura mater was adherent 
in part and there was an excess of subarachnoid fluid. Sir William 
Gowers believes that a peculiar chemical reaction takes place, lead 
replacing some of the hydrogen in the brain tissue. 

F. W. Mott has reported ("Arch, of Neurology and Psychiatry," 
1910) the pathological findings in a case of chronic encephalitis due 
to plumbism. The brain showed disseminated punctate hemorrhages 
filling the perivascular spaces, resulting from both arterial and ve- 
nous vascular degeneration. There was also considerable neuroglia 
increase in both gray and white matter of the cortex. The patient 
had been delirious and his symptoms and post-mortem findings simu- 
lated dementia paralytica. No lead could be found in the brain. 
Sicard and Bloch have reported a similar case observed in France 
with symptoms of dementia paralytica. They obtained a positive 
Wassermann reaction from the spinal fluid. 

DURATION OF RETENTION OF LEAD IN THE SYSTEM. In chronic 
lead poisoning it seems that often a long duration of poisoning is a 
more potent factor than a large quantity of poison; for its effects 
certainly, if not its substance, are strongly accumulative. Very little 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 241 

lead, not more than ^ grain, if absorbed daily, before long gives rise 
to toxic symptoms. 

Oliver states that lead has been found in the urine, feces and 
vomitus of patients with chronic saturnism 16 months after quitting 
work in lead. In rare cases lead may remain for years in the sys- 
tem and then be liberated owing to some subtle change, giving rise 
to more or less acute and definite symptoms. The administration 
of potassium iodid may be the causative factor of this phenomenon. 
Oliver cites a case in which lead symptoms reappeared 17 years 
after a previous attack, and another, that of a painter, in which the 
interval was 18 years since lead had been handled. He also cites 
the remarkable case of a patient who, as a girl of 19 years, had lead 
colic, blindness and paralysis. She recovered, quit work, married, 
and bore several children. Seventeen years later she complained of 
diplopia, headache and ocular paralysis, and lead was found in the 
urine. He explains the phenomenon on the ground that some un- 
known change in metabolism suddenly liberated lead which had long 
been stored in the system and gave rise to the return of acute symp- 
toms. 

In further illustration of long retention of lead in the body in 
toxic amount is the case of a woman of 46 years who came to the 
Cornell service in Bellevue Hospital with a history of having had 
double wrist-drop 5 years before, after painting some furniture with 
white enamel. There had been no opportunity since that time for 
exposure to lead poisoning, yet when seen the patient had a decided 
lead line on the gums, granular basophilia, abdominal colic and par- 
tial wrist-drop. 

The causes of death from plumbism are various. In acute cases, 
as from inhaling concentrated lead fumes, the victim may die from 
suffocation, paralysis of the heart or acute parenchymatous nephritis. 
In chronic cases death may ensue from lesions incident to arterio- 
sclerosis such as cerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm, etc., from uremia 
and convulsions consequent upon chronic interstitial nephritis, and 
more rarely from progressive anemia and emaciation, or from en- 
cephalitis. In many chronic cases death results from some inter- 
current disease acting in conjunction with the patient's weakened 



242 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

resisting powers incident to the chronic nephritis and advanced 
arteriosclerosis. Dr. Mosny, of Paris, has described subarachnoid 
hemorrhages, and lead may be found in the brain substance. 

Symptoms. The symptoms of lead poisoning are most often 
chronic, but may be subacute or very acute, according to the par- 
ticular form of poisoning. Dr. Hamilton states that the most acute 
case she has known was that of a white "lead worker who became 
poisoned in three days. 

Acute poisoning has occurred exceptionally among workmen sud- 
denly exposed to overwhelming doses, as when a cask of red or white 
lead is accidentally broken, enveloping the workman in dust, or 
when a back-draft drives fumes of molten lead into his face. In 
such cases he may die from asphyxia (See page 144), or pulmonary 
edema (See page 154). 

The symptoms of chronic lead poisoning may advantageously be 
summarized in brief before detailed consideration. The most strik- 
ing are: abdominal colic, paralyses of the hands and forearms, or 
"drop-wrist," increased blood pressure, a lead line in the gums, con- 
stipation, anemia, and granular basophilia. Other symptoms are: 
a fixed, drawn expression, light jaundice, the presence of lead in 
the urine, sometimes alimentary dextrosuria, levulosuria and hemato- 
porphyrinuria, dyspepsia, increased tendon reflexes, vertigo, nausea, 
a metallic taste in the mouth, and finally emaciation. 

PEODBOMATA. Acute attacks of lead colic usually are preceded 
by marked gastro-intestinal disturbance. The patient complains of 
malaise, a coated tongue, foul breath, constipation, nausea or dis- 
comfort after eating, and headache. All these symptoms, in fact, 
may proceed from a catarrhal gastritis and constipation. 

LEAD CACHEXIA. When patients have recurrent acute attacks, as 
painters very often do, with intervals of months or years, they usu- 
ally become cachectic, with a yellowish, pale complexion, coated 
tongue, dyspepsia, moderate secondary anemia, often granular baso- 
philia, chronic moderate albuminuria, gradually hardening arteries 
and moderately increased arterial pressure. There are also inter- 
mittent neuralgic pains in the joints and nerves and progressive 
emaciation. (Fig. 40.) The breath is foul, the tongue constantly 



244 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

coated with, white fur, there is either a sweetish or metallic taste in 
the mouth. There may be caries of the teeth and gingivitis is 
usually present in chronic cases. The gums, which are of purple 
hue, may bleed readily and are so retracted and everted as to make 
the teeth appear longer. The soreness of the teeth and gums may 
prevent the patient from eating sufficient solid food. Anorexia is 
often present, favored by a foul condition of the mouth and tongue 
and dyspepsia. 

LEAD COLIC. Lead colic is a very typical phenomenon which 
has received a variety of explanations. Sollman's theory is that the 
intestinal terminal nerves are stimulated by lead to cause undue 
muscular contraction, which is of the nature of continued spasm 
rather than a typical peristaltic wave. This exaggerated contracture 
results, he believes, in compressing and emptying the splanchnic ves- 
sels, which in turn raises the general arterial pressure and causes 
the local intestinal muscular spasm. In a further stage of intense 
colic, however, the pain, like all excruciating suffering, flowers the 
general blood pressure and almost completely inhibits the action of 
the heart. Both atropin and such vasodilators as the nitrites and 
chloral tend to relieve the colic, which fact affords some confirmation 
of Sollman's theory. On the other hand, Sir Thomas Oliver found, 
by injecting a solution of lead nitrate of a strength of 1 to 10 per 
cent, into the veins of dogs, that the general arterial pressure in- 
variably fell, and with the larger doses the heart action gave out, 
but without immediate paralysis of respiration. 

The colic is accompanied by restlessness and jactitation, the pa- 
tient flinging himself about in bed or rolling on the floor in the vain 
hope of relief by change of position. The abdominal wall, especially 
the lower half, is tense and retracted. Many patients feel relief by 
firm pressure over the abdomen, but others will not tolerate any 
pressure, and, in fact, become hyperesthetic. The pain is relieved 
for a short time by movement of the bowels. 

Attacks of lead colic are very often recurrent at intervals. After 
a first attack is recovered from the workman for a time heeds pre- 
ventive warnings, but later becomes careless again, and accumulative 
absorption of the poison brings on another attack. Oliver refers to 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 245 

a man who had 15 attacks in 10 years, and several of my patients 
gave a history of as many. 

Attacks of colic are accompanied by most obstinate constipation, 
increase of pallor and arterial pressure and absence of perspiration 
indications of vasomotor spasm. There may be accompanying 
strangury, and the abdomen is hard, retracted and often tender in 
the umbilical region, which is usually the chief focus of the pain. 
There may be accompanying cramps in the calves of the legs, and 
dyspnea, because movements of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm 
intensify the pain. Potain describes an accompanying contracture 
of the liver, but, owing to the abdominal rigidity, this is difficult to 
determine with accuracy; and, on the contrary, L. Devoto and L. 
Carozzi, of the Milan Hospital for Industrial Diseases, find that 
the liver usually is considerably enlarged. 

Oliver has observed a unilateral predominance of abdominal pain 
in some cases, with tenderness to pressure of the vagus nerve and 
pupillary contraction on the same side. These phenomena I have 
never witnessed. Most patients describe their pain as central (um- 
bilical), radiating bilaterally. 

The percentage of lead colic is given very diversely by different 
authors, being all the way from 2.7 per cent. (Cosolo, of Trieste) to 
30 per cent, (various British records). Among 43 cases reported 
to the New York State Department of Labor it was conspicuous in 
29. In a series of 64 of my cases it was present in 45. It may be 
said, however, that practically all patients with chronic plumbism 
sooner or later have an attack of colic, whereas in many the attacks 
are numerous and constitute the most striking feature of the case. 

The urine during lead colic attacks is very much reduced in 
volume, and often presents a faint albumin reaction and a few 
hyalin casts. After many attacks of colic the victim usually begins 
to show evidence in the urine of a chronic interstitial nephritis. 
Indicanuria is usually present during the attacks, as it is in con- 
stipation generally. 

Tympanites often accompanies the chronic constipation, and 
especially the attacks of colic. There is often much soreness to the 
touch over the tense abdominal wall. Pallor of a yellowish white 



hue is due both to anemia and vasomotor spasm. A slight subicteroid 
hue may be present. 

"BURTONIAN LINE." The blue line, first described by Burton 
and hence called the "Burtonian line," is most decided upon the 
margin of the gums anteriorly and close to the teeth. It is a 
deposit, just beneath the surface, of lead which has been converted 
into a black sulphid by contact with sulphuretted hydrogen or such 
other sulphur compounds as are derived from certain proteid and 
vegetable foods, such as eggs, cabbage, etc. The fine lead granules 
are held within the large connective tissue corpuscles at the margin 
of the gums, in which they may be deposited by phagocytes, or into 
which they are absorbed when lead dust enters into the mouth, or 
lead previously absorbed may be resecreted by the salivary glands as 
a sulphid formed by the sulphocyanite of the saliva. Possibly, also, 
bacteria of decomposition lodged upon proteid food between the teeth 
may furnish the necessary sulphur for the lead sulphid (Oliver). 
Bedson has found traces of lead in the saliva, as well as in the 
gastric secretion, some time after the patient had ceased working in 
lead. 

The lead line persists often for months and sometimes a year 
or more after cessation of work in lead. Toothless areas do not 
present this blue line, but, exceptionally, the buccal mucosa and 
more rarely that of the tongue may present bluish black deposits of 
lead sulphid, perhaps a centimeter in diameter. I have seen them 
most often on the inner surface of the lower lip. They usually 
occur in portions of the lip or cheek mucosa opposite a decayed 
tooth. 

The frequency of the presence of the lead line is given by various 
authors as observed in from 10 per cent, in Italian records to 37.7 
per cent, in Belgian records. In 43 cases reported in detail to the 
New York State Department of Labor it was observed 17 times. 
In a series of 64 of my cases 33 had a more or less distinct blue 
line. It is not usually observed short of at least six months' expos- 
ure to lead poisoning. It occurs quite independently of attacks of 
colic and is often observed in lead workers who have not themselves 
been aware of any symptoms of plumbism. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 247 

GINGIVITIS. There is chronic gingivitis and the gums at the 
margins of the teeth become at first swollen,- and then retracted so 
as to make the teeth, which are blackened, appear much elongated. 
A bluish film appears on the gums of those who have worked for 
some hours in lead fumes or dust. It is paler than the true "blue 
line," and, being wholly superficial, may be washed off easily. 

METALLIC TASTE. A metallic taste with a coated tongue is 
often complained of and gives rise to anorexia. Oliver states that 
the physiological sulphocyanite reaction observed with normal saliva 
is temporarily absent during attacks of lead colic, but this is a 
phenomenon of no clinical importance. 

HEART. The heart is often hypertrophied as a result of the 
increasing arteriosclerosis and high tension pulse. C. Lian and E. 
Marcovel, in La presse medicale, Feb., 1913, reported four cases 
of bradycardia in connection with lead colic. The atropin test 
indicated that the poison acted on the vagus nerve and its terminals 
in the heart. 

BLOOD EXAMINATION. A moderate secondary anemia is the rule 
in chronic lead poisoning. The hemoglobin usually falls to 75 or 85 
per cent, but I have records of 50 per cent. The red cells are not 
often found to fall below 4,000,000, and are often 4,500,000 or 
more. Some of my records show a count above 4,700,000, and a 
few below 3,000,000 in advanced plumbism. The leukocytes are 
usually, but not always, somewhat increased. In 9 out of 17 of 
my cases selected for comparison the differential count placed the 
leukocytes above 12,000, the maximum being 17,300. The polynu- 
clear count varied from 60 to 76 per cent., and the lymphocytes 
from 17 to 28 per cent. 

A slight eosinophilia is sometimes present. The red cells be- 
come filled with the dark, fine granules which stain with basic 
anilin. These granular basophiles are often present in chronic 
lead poisoning. Among my cases of plumbism in special examina- 
tions of the blood, made in 25 persons, basophilia was observed 17 
times. Biondi believes that the granules which may appear inter- 
mittently indicate new cell formation. They may number from 
0.03 to 0.3 per cent, or more. In one of my cases they reached 1.8 



248 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

per cent. If present in less than 0.01 per cent., they are of little 
diagnostic significance. 

According to P. Schmidt, at least 100 out of 1,000,000 red cells 
must contain basophilic granules and a count of as many as 300 to 
3,000 is usual in lead poisoning. 

From the point of view of prognosis, their presence is favorable 
and absence unfavorable, but it is important to make repeated 
examinations, owing to their intermittent presence. Much depends, 
also, upon the skill of the observer, and it should be remembered 
that basophilia has been observed occasionally in malaria, carcinoma 
and tuberculosis. Nevertheless, taken in connection with other 
symptoms of chronic plumbism, the test is not without value. 

L. Devoto and L. Carozzi, of the Milan Hospital for Industrial 
Diseases, regard both the polychromatophilia and granular baso- 
philia as a sign of hematopoietic reaction against the poison, and to 
that extent it is favorable. They record basophilia as reaching 1.74 
per cent. 

UKINE. Authorities differ strangely as to the frequency with 
which traces of lead are demonstrable in the urine in chronic cases. 
Oliver believes the test to be very often positive, and consequently 
of great value. My own experience accords with that of many 
French and German writers, who find it very infrequently. 

Albumin and granular and hyalin casts are very often found, 
and sooner or later the victim of chronic lead poisoning usually gives 
evidence of a chronic interstitial nephritis. Of 44 painters exam- 
ined in 1910 by the Illinois State Commission for the Study of 
Occupational Diseases, 14 were found to have advanced chronic 
nephritis. 

FECES. Lead is sometimes eliminated by the feces long after 
the patient has ceased to be exposed to the risk of swallowing it, 
indicating that it may be eliminated by the bile or intestinal mucosa. 
J. Rambousek and Pieracci claim that it is more often to be found 
in the feces than the urine. 

WEIGHT. Loss of weight is a marked feature of many cases of 
lead poisoning, usually of those which have obstinate constipation 
with attacks of colic, nausea and vomiting, or which develop a 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 249 

marked secondary anemia. One of my patients, a painter who had 
chronic plumbism for 8 or 9 years, lost 56 Ibs. in 5 years; another, 
also a painter, 52 Ibs. in 18 months; one lost 12 Ibs. in 6 months; 
one, 17 Ibs. in 3 months, and one, 10 Ibs. in 2 months. The face 
and neck particularly become thin, and the muscular atrophy may 
account for part of the loss of weight. 

FEVER. Fever is a symptom not usually recorded in connection 
with acute exacerbations of plumbism, and Karl Wachter states 
positively that it does not occur, yet in my experience it is very 
common. It is apparently due to autotoxemia from chronic con- 
stipation, and usually accompanies attacks of colic. The temper- 
ature rises to 100 or 101 F. the highest I have met with was 
102.5 F. and lasts from two to five days usually. One of my 
patients had a temperature which rose to 102 F. during 10 
days, and slight fever was present in 13 cases during attacks of 
colic. 

DIARRHEA. Diarrhea is very uncommon in chronic lead poison- 
ing, but I have observed it in few cases, alternating with constipa- 
tion. In such cases, moreover, the patient is often an alcoholic 
subject, so that the irregularity of the bowels may be due in part 
to that complication. 

FACIAL EXPRESSION. Facial expression changes in chronic lead 
poisoning. The muscles appear drawn and the expression is somber. 
The general pallor is particularly marked in the face and there are 
dark lines under the eyes. (Fig. 41.) 

EFFECT OF SULPHUR BATHS. If a lead worker take a sulphur 
vapor bath or a fluid bath impregnated with potassium sulphid, the 
skin becomes blackened superficially by lead sulphid. Minra has 
shown, however, that the test applies only over portions of the skin 
which have been exposed to lead dust or solutions and not protected 
by clothing. 

WASSERMANN REACTION. The Wassermann reaction has been 
observed in non-syphilitic cases of chronic lead poisoning, accord- 
ing to Dreyer and Schnitter as reported in the Deutscher medizinische 
Wochenshrift, 1911, Nos. 17 and 22, but Robert Hilgermann, of 
Coblenz, writing in the same journal, 1912, No. 38, states that in

6 years. He was a painter for 20 years. (From the Report of the Illinois 
State Commission on Occupational Diseases, Jan., 1911.)

35 cases examined he was unable to retain the reaction in anyone. 
A positive reaction was obtained in several of my cases in which 
syphilis could be excluded. 

Dr. Cyrus W. Field, of the Pathological Laboratory of Bellevue 
Hospital, reports (Jour. Amer. 
Med. Assoc., June, 1912) ob- 
taining a positive Wassermann 
reaction in 8 out of 12 cases of 
lead poisoning examined. In 
at least 5 of these syphilis 
could quite definitely be ex- 
cluded. 

Cuts and abrasions heal 
poorly in the subjects of 
chronic lead poisoning and 
furunculosis is common among 
them. 

NERVOUS SYSTEM. In 
chronic lead poisoning an im- 
portant group of symptoms is 
referable to the nervous sys- 
tem. Such are cephalalgia, 
impairment of vision, abdom- 
inal colic and peripheral neu- 
ritis, lack of energy and im- 
pairment of ability for work,

John B. Andrews.) 

psychasthenic symptoms and 

encephalopathy. Headache, vertigo and tinnitus aurium frequently 

are complained of. 

Lead palsy typically involves first the extensors of the third and 

fourth fingers, soon involving the extensors of all the fingers and 

wrist. The supinators usually escape. The hand thus falls, when 

the arm is raised at right angles in ulnar abduction, as shown in 

Figure 42. 

The triceps, biceps, brachialis anticus and deltoid muscles are 

very often paralyzed, and sometimes, also, the supra- and infra- 



252 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



spinatus. Exceptionally the quadriceps of the legs and the ex- 
tensors of the foot and toes may be paralyzed. (Fig. 43.) The 
paralysis rarely has involved the muscles of the larynx, causing 
aphonia, and the diaphragm. In exceptional cases lead paralysis 

has been known to involve the muscles 
of the eyes. Sir Thomas Oliver cites 
3 cases in which a rare form of 
paralysis en bloc ensued, i. e., in which 
all the muscles simultaneously became 
paralyzed, the patient lying helpless, 
unable to move or even to masticate or 
swallow. The rapidity of recovery in 
two of these cases suggests a very acute 
toxemia with possibly an hysterical ele- 
ment added, but there are recorded 
cases of death from paralysis of the 
respiratory muscles. 

The typical case of lead paralysis 
is unquestionably the' double wrist-drop 
(Fig. 44), in which the victim is un- 
able to grasp an object, button his 
clothing or feed himself, but one meets 
with many varieties, as above de- 
scribed. 

Contractures in various groups of 
muscles may occur. One of my pa- 
tients, a painter who worked with white 
lead paint, complained of attacks of 
cramp in the fingers of the right hand. 
He was saturated with lead, which was 
obtained from the urine. He had 
handled paint for 20 years, and it is 

quite possible that the cramp was an occupation neurosis rather 
than due to plumbism, for there were no symptoms of neuritic pain 
or palsy in the arm or hand. 

Muscular pain and soreness, quite distinct from neuritis, some-

Bureau of Labor, July, 1911.) 



254 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

times may be demonstrated in chronic plumbism, particularly in 
painters. 

Pains in the joints, especially the elbows, wrists, shoulders and 
knees", are often present, and I have known them to be mistaken for 
ordinary rheumatism. The joints become painful with both active 
and passive motion and may be slightly swollen. 

Lumbago also is common. 

The reaction of degeneration appears after a time in the paralyzed 
muscles, but with prolonged muscular atrophy all electric reaction is 
greatly diminished or almost absent. 

Neuralgic pains in various nerves are common. I have observed 
this symptom in the nerves of the face, back and shoulders. 

Paresthesia or dysesthesia is not uncommon. There are fre- 
quently sensations of prickling, burning, or numbness in the fingers, 
and sometimes in the legs. Such abnormalities usually, but not 
always, are coincident with muscular weakness. 

The reflexes are more often diminished than increased. I have 
several times found the knee : jerk entirely absent, and only once 
decidedly increased. 

Tremors of the labio-facial muscles are common, and are best 
demonstrated by asking the patient to show the teeth or make 
grimaces. 

Spinal Cord Symptoms. Comparatively little has been written 
regarding spinal cord lesions in chronic saturnism, most of the 
nervous symptoms being referred to the peripheral nerves and brain, 
but H. Eichhorst (Med. Klinik, Feb. 9, 1913) has described a case 
of spastic spinal paralysis t in a house painter. In two other cases he 
found multiple sclerosis of the cord and brain. 

Cerebral Symptoms.-, Lead produces, exceptionally, a consider- 
able variety of cerebral symptoms, both acute and chronic. They 
may be of the nature of hysteria, delirium,, -convulsions, or paralytic 
dementia. The acute forms especially are mjuih more liable to 
affect young subjects, especially females. Saturnine encephalopathy, 
as the cerebral form of lead poisoning is called, more often attacks 
women than men. It is usually preceded by severe headache for 
some days, when the patient may have sudden convulsions followed 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 255 

by coma, often fatal within two or three days. There is almost 
complete anuria, and there may or may not be albuminuria. If the 
patient survive, he may have temporary or permanent blindness 
from neuroretinitis. 

This strange type of poisoning occurs without the other more 
usual manifestations of lead toxemia such as neuritis or colic. Oliver 
states that he has seen it in young women not nephritic and who 
were not alcoholic, and he cites one fatal case in a young woman 
who had worked in a white lead factory only five weeks. M. Mosney, 
of Paris, attributes the symptoms to an acute meningo-encephalitis. 
In some cases a sort of toxic hysteria precedes the other symptoms. 

This type of plumbism is rare in this country. With a con- 
siderable experience with all other forms of lead poisoning, I do not 
recall a case in which the cerebral symptoms could not have been 
accounted for by either alcoholism or uremia, or both, and such 
cases certainly are rare in the literature in the United States. Dr. 
Hamilton was able to collect histories of 52 cases, and two or three 
more have recently been reported to the New York State Labor 
Bureau. Her 52 cases "were divided by trades as follows: pottery 
workers (11 women, 5 men), 16; white and red lead (men), 13; 
enamelers (men), 10; painters (men), 9; printers (men), 2; glass- 
worker (woman), 1; paint mixer (man), 1." 

In England and France, however, women are much oftener em- 
ployed in various lead manufactures than in this country, and as 
they are peculiarly susceptible to saturnism this may account for the 
greater frequency of encephalopathy among them as compared with 
males. 

In Italy lead encephalopathy is so rare, at least in chronic form, 
that the asylums for the insane have recorded no new case for several 
years. If recovery takes place, temporary or permanent blindness 
may result. In the fatal cases lead has been found in the brain as 
well as in other parts of the body. 

The psychoses which accompany encephalitis are not to be re- 
garded as other than phenomena of a dementia paralytica; that is, 
the so-called "lead insanity" is not a separate entity, but results 
from ordinary vascular degenerative changes in the brain. The 



256 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

delirious patients may have maniacal raving, alternating with coma 
and epileptiform convulsions. There may be aphonia, amblyopia 
and amaurosis. 

In lead meningitis lumbar puncture may show an increased 
pressure of the arachnoid fluid with lymphocytosis. There are severe, 
persistent headache and delirium, sometimes with vomiting, brady- 
cardia and paralyses. 

Lead blindness may be temporary or permanent. It is a much 
less common symptom than. with certain other poisons. It may be 
due to optic neuritis or neuroretinitis, or to more transient con- 
ditions. Retinal hemorrhages are observed, and the eye fundus 
should always be examined in cases of chronic saturnism. The 
hemorrhages occur sometimes independently of any renal lesion, 
and may be due to direct irritation of the retina by lead particles, 
or, according to Leuber and Deutschmann, to the conveyance of lead 
molecules from the subarachnoid spaces of the brain to the sheath 
of the optic nerve. The optic disc may atrophy. 

The area of blindness may be complete or partial. The muscles 
of the eyeball may become paralyzed, causing diplopia. 

MENOERIIAGIA. Women workers in lead frequently suffer from 
menorrhagia. 

ABORTIONS AND MISCARRIAGES. Oliver found that married 
women who formerly were permitted to work in white lead produc- 
tion almost invariably miscarried, or bore stillborn infants, or infants 
that died at an early age of convulsions. It was this circumstance 
which attracted his attention to the hazards of lead work and led 
to the admirable investigations which in England have resulted in 
so much beneficial parliamentary control of the entire lead industry. 
In the stillborn infants Professor Bedson determined traces of lead 
in the kidneys and liver. 

Of 141 pregnant women who worked in lead factories in France 
it was found by Constantin Paul that 82 aborted, 4 gave rise to 
premature births, 5 to stillborn infants. Of the 50 infants born 
living at term, 35 died within two years. Thus only 15 children 
of 141 pregnant women lived beyond the third year. 

In the French Department of Labor Report on Industrial Poi- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 257 

sons, made by M. Tardieu in 1905, among 1,000 pregnancies in lead 
workers, 609 terminated in abortion. 

STERILITY. Males having chronic lead poisoning, although not 
impotent, often become sterile. P. Rudaux (La clinique, Jan. 21, 
1910) found that among the wives of 75 lead workers having 442 
pregnancies there were 66 abortions and 241 miscarriages. 

CHILDREN OF LEAD WORKERS. Oliver found that of the chil- 
dren of paint grinders, ''40 per cent, die of convulsions during the 
first year of life." 

Lead has been found in the placenta as well as in the internal 
organs of the offspring of toxic mothers. Idiocy and infantilism 
have frequently been observed among the children of lead-poisoned 
pottery workers. 

In the Harz Mountains, among the lead smelting works, it has 
been found that cows, sheep and hares that graze in pastures near 
where the lead fumes are given off acquire hematuria and mis- 
carriages (Oliver). 

Associated Diseases. TUBERCULOSIS. It appears to be every- 
where the case, not only in this country but abroad, that the mor- 
tality among typesetters from tuberculosis is very high. The in- 
creasing use of linotype machines is making some improvement, for 
except in the lead melting process, which is occasional, not constant, 
work, the linotypist handles less dusty material. Statistics gathered 
by George A. Stevens, of the ISTew York State Labor Bureau, show 
that during the semi-decade, 1901-1905, compositors died from tu- 
berculosis in both Xew York City and State in double the ratio of 
the male population in general. As they are an intelligent lot of 
workmen and command good wages, this death cannot be attributed 
altogether to deficient home sanitation and must be due in great 
part to conditions in the composing room. In ]^ew York City, 
moreover, in 1905, the death rate from respiratory diseases was 
more than double that of Germany, where precautionary measures 
of sanitation have been in force for compositors for 15 years. 

In a group of over 300 typesetters, printers and lithographers 
treated in the Milan Clinic, in 1910-11, there were 123 cases of 
respiratory disease, of which 56 were tuberculosis, 14 were cases of 



258 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

pleurisy, 21 of arthralgia, 38 of diseases of the circulation, 31 of 
renal disease, 32 of the nervous system, 88 of the digestive system, 
82 of liver diseases, 3 of diabetes, and 32 of chronic lead poisoning. 
GOUT. Garrod has stated that one-fourth of all cases of gout 
are to be met with among lead workers, and in those parts of Eng- 
land where gout is very common it is very often associated with lead 
poisoning. Although, as many lead workers are drinkers, possibly 
there is some degree of accidental coincidence in this association, 
and Oliver points out that from difference in habit or climatic con- 
ditions lead workers in the north of England rarely suffer from 
gout. He found that the elimination of uric acid and of lead is 
inversely related. 

A review of the cases of lead poisoning met with in the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital during a dozen years showed that about half of 
them, it was claimed, were associated with gout. My personal ex- 
perience has been very different. I meet with many cases of true 
tophaceous gout among the laboring classes, and many of lead poison- 
ing, but rarely find both diseases in the same patient. In a series of 
64 of my cases of plumbism gout could be determined positively only 
in 5. 

INSANITY. Dr. Robert Jones, reporting in 1900 upon 3,500 
males admitted to the London County Asylum for the Insane, found 
among them 133 artisans who had been exposed to plumbism as 
follows : 

"Painters 75

Records of Personal Cases. I have records of 268 cases of lead 
poisoning observed in the past 8 years in my personal service or 



260 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

that of my colleagues in the wards of the Presbyterian and Bellevue 
Hospitals, and in my clinics in the Cornell University Medical Col- 
lege Dispensary and Bellevue Hospital Dispensary. In the Cornell 
Dispensary 25 cases were observed in six months, during the winter 
season of 1911-12, and were especially studied for me by Dr. Kenney. 

One group of these cases, comprising a series of 64, may be 
taken to illustrate the relative frequency of the various symptoms 
of plumbism, and some of the cases will also be given in detail. By 
occupation the 64 cases are grouped as follows : 

36 Painters. These were for the most part indoor painters of 
houses, carriages, automobiles, etc. 

5 White lead manufacturers working chiefly in the converting 
beds. 

4 "Sealers," or scrapers of red lead paint, from inside the double 
hulls of warships in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. These men were not 
in the service of the navy, but were common laborers employed 
under contract. They did no painting, but scraped off old paint 
with automatic chisels. 

3 Laborers employed in carrying bars and sheets of lead, etc. 

3 Plumbers 

1 Lead smelter 

1 Steel hardener, using molten lead 

1 Wire hardener 

1 Paint mixer 

1 Laborer employed in handling refuse from a type foundry 

1 Electrotyper 

1 Enameler 

1 Solder caster 

1 Designer who moistened his paint brush in his mouth while 
retouching photographs 

1 General mechanic 

2 Typesetters 
1 Housewife 

Of these 64 patients 45 had abdominal colic; 33 had a more or 
less distinct lead line on the gums; 29 had attacks of nausea and 
vomiting; 23 had neuritis of the arm, leg and other nerves; 16 had 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 261 

more or less decided palsy; 19 had chronic nephritis; 13 had slight 
febrile attacks accompanying the colic; 14 had moderate cardiac 
hypertrophy, 5 complained of vertigo ; 4 of chronic conjunctivitis ; 3 
of distinct joint pains in the major joints of the extremities ; and 
nearly all had arteriosclerosis. In 25 well-marked cases search was 
made for granular basophilia. It was present in 17; absent in 8. 
In a few of the cases the urine was examined for lead, and it was 
found in 3 cases. In a number of others, although there was almost 
every other evidence of lead poisoning, it could not be detected in 
the urine on careful analysis. In many cases the blood pressure 
was moderately increased; in one it was as high as 217 and, in 
another, 225 mm. This patient died of cerebral hemorrhage at the 
age of 45 years. In a large proportion of the cases considerable 
arterial thickening was apparent. Fourteen of the patients had had 
two distinct attacks of plumbism, i. e., of acute symptoms; 3 had 3 
attacks, and 8 had 4 or more. Among the complications observed 
in. this series of cases were single examples of nocturnal epilepsy 
(in a painter 43 years of age), emphysema, hemoptysis, hematemesis, 
tuberculosis (one case only), fatal cerebral hemorrhage and convul- 
sions. Five patients had gout. 

As showing the great variability in susceptibility to lead poison- 
ing, the longest period of work in lead was 40 years (3 cases) and 
the shortest 2 months. One patient had been exposed 34 years; 
one each for 3Q, 28, 24 and 22 years respectively, and two for 20 
years before serious symptoms compelled them to seek hospital or 
dispensary relief. In all, 22, or nearly one-third, of the patients 
had been employed more than 10 years. On the other hand, 6 had 
been employed less than 6 months, two of them, as stated above, for 
only two months. 

DETAILS OF ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. The following cases present 
special features of sufficient interest to merit more detailed report: 

Case 2. This case illustrates the onset of symptoms in the lower 
extremities. The patient was an Irishman, 42 years of age. For 5 
months previous to admission to my clinic he was employed handling 
refuse from a type foundry. The work was indoors, where the air 
was always heavily laden with metallic dust of lead, zinc and copper. 



262 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

After 4 months of this work he began to suffer from cramp-like pains 
in the lower abdomen, occurring more or less irregularly three or four 
times a day. The attacks were sometimes followed by vomiting, 
after which pain was relieved. Later they increased in severity and 
were induced by taking food or^ drink. A week after the abdominal 
cramps appeared the patient noticed weakness in his knees and legs. 
Two or three days later he felt shooting pains in the shoulders and 
gradually increasing weakness in his shoulder muscles. He next 
experienced difficulty in raising his hands. There was loss of weight 
and he was obliged to stop work because of progressive weakness. 
Becoming unable to walk, he sought relief in a hospital. His blood 
examination follows : 

Red cells 5,744,000 

Hemoglobin, per cent 95 

Leukocytes 10,000 

Polynuclear cells, per cent 79 

Marked granular basophilia and polychromatophilia. 

Case 4. The patient, aged 48 years, had been a general painter 
for 18 years. When first seen he had granular basophilia, 4 per cent., 
albuminuria and considerable gastric disturbance. He had had acute 
articular rheumatism two years before and several attacks since then. 
He presented a splenomyelogenous leukemia with a leukocyte count 
of 270,000, and a very large spleen. Under treatment with the 
X-ray and Fowler's solution he greatly improved, the count fell to 
38,000 and the spleen was reduced in size. Three months after 
leaving Bellevue Hospital he returned because of pain in the abdo- 
men, dyspnea, and the reenlargement of the spleen, which filled half 
the abdominal cavity. The leukocytes then numbered 462,000, but 
the basophilia was only 0.3 per cent. 

Presumably the leukemia was independent of the mild grade of 
lead toxemia. 

Case 6. This man, 30 years of age, had been employed as a 
general indoor painter for 10 years. He entered Bellevue Hospital 
in coma with hemiplegia. He had a decided lead line, marked 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 263 

basophilia, an extreme degree of arteriosclerosis, moderate cardiac 
hypertrophy, blood pressure 215 mm., and an anemia registering 65 
per cent, hemoglobin and 4,400,000 erythrocytes. Chronic nephri- 
tis was also present. He died without regaining consciousness. 

Case 7. This man had been a plumber for 24 years, handling 
both white and red lead. For two years prior to admission to the 
Presbyterian Hospital he had been constipated after an attack of 
colic, and for 7 months had tremor of the hands, especially when 
excited, and a reeling gait. For 6 weeks he had had pains in both 
knees; for 3 weeks severe pains in both elbows; for two weeks ab- 
dominal cramps, vertigo and headache; and for 3 days vomiting. 
There was slight fever on admission (101 F.), which lasted 4 days. 
The urine gave 5 per cent, of albumin, granular, hyalin and epithe- 
lial casts and red blood corpuscles, and a specific gravity of 1.030. 
The blood analysis showed on admission : 

Hemoglobin TO per cent. 

Ked cells 5,900,000 

Leukocytes 17,300 

Polynuclear cells 73.5 per cent. 

Lymphocytes 17 per cent. 

Mononuclear cells 6 per cent. 

Transitional 3 per cent. 

Normoblast . . . 1 

Basophiles 0.5 per cent. 

Color Index 59 

There was a lead line on the teeth, there was chronic conjuncti- 
vitis, blood pressure was 182 mm., and the heart was slightly en- 
larged. The abdomen was very tympanitic. Note : This case illus- 
trates how a man immune for many years finally had a serious lead 
colic, lasting three weeks, which he disregarded, keeping at work 
and eating his lunch in his shop, until after two years more he pre- 
sented all the classical symptoms of colic, neuritis, joint pains, 
chronic nephritis, arteriosclerosis with hypertension and cardiac hy- 
pertrophy, anemia, granular basophilia and a lead line on the gums.

Cases 9 and 10. Both these men were painters and had been 
so employed for more than 25 years. They were among the 5 pa- 
tients of the series of 64 who had had attacks of gout, which in one 
case had recurred at intervals for 16 years, and in the other for 10 
years. One had tophi in the ears and fingers and the hands were 
much crippled. 

Case 11. This case, seen in April, 1910, further illustrates the 
coincidence of gout and plumbism. The patient, an American, 54 
years of age, had been a general painter for 35 years. His family 
history was negative as to gout. He had been a free drinker of 
beer, porter and whiskey. Eleven years before coming to my clinic 
he was ill for a week with a serious lead colic. For 10 years he has 
had two or three attacks a year of gout. The first of these was only 
in the right great toe joint, but later attacks extended to the ankles, 
knees, elbows and finger joints. He had lately lost 20 Ibs. in weight. 
On admission there was typical acute gout in both ankles, and there 
were moderate fever and evidence in the urine of chronic interstitial 
nephritis. There was no granular basophilia, and the case was 
rather one of severe gout complicated by a mild degree of plumbism 
than the reverse. 

Case 12. This patient was 52 years of age, but appeared quite 
senile. He had been employed for 15 years in stripping the convert- 
ing beds of white lead. His first attack of constipation, vomiting 
and lead colic occurred after working for the -first nine months, and 
the second followed 5 months later. Since that time he had had 
numerous attacks, but after recovery always resumed work. He 
presented a spastic gait, increased knee jerks, and sluggish pupils. 
He was not alcoholic or syphilitic and appeared to be developing a 
spastic paraplegia. He was very weak and feeble. A lead line 
was obvious in the gums and neuritis of the legs was present. He 
was constipated and dyspeptic. Arteriosclerosis was marked, the 
heart was slightly hypertrophic, and emphysema was present. He 
ate his luncheon in the workroom. A small poster advised cleanli- 
ness, but it was too faded to be read, and washing facilities were of 
the poorest. He stated that many of his 60 fellow workmen had 
plumbism. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 265 

Case 13. This man, 47 years of age, was a steel hardener, em- 
ployed in plunging magnetized bodies into molten lead, the fumes of 
which he inhaled, as ventilation was poor and the workroom rarely 
cleaned. He lunched in the workroom. Six months after begin- 
ning work, in January, 1911, he had an acute attack of vomiting, 
constipation and abdominal colic. He worked for 4 months longer, 
when he acquired double wrist-drop, and in the 18 months after 
beginning work he lost 52 Ibs. He presented a lead line, increased 
blood pressure (150 mm.), slight cardiac hypertrophy, emphysema, 
dyspepsia, constipation, moderate secondary anemia, neuritis and 
general weakness. 

Case 16. This patient, although only 27 years old, had worked 
for 11 years under adverse conditions as a painter and interior 
decorator, using white lead paints, putty, and sandpapering dry 
paint. He illustrates the toleration which many workmen acquire 
for lead, for he had none of the symptoms of plumbism, but had a 
well developed tuberculous lesion with tubercle bacilli in the sputum. 

Case 17. This man, 62 years of age, also illustrated insuscepti- 
bility to lead poisoning. He had been an inside and outside house 
painter for 40 years without ever having lead symptoms or present- 
ing any of the phenomena of plumbism. He came to my clinic for 
symptoms of a gastric carcinoma. He attributed his immunity to 
the habit of drinking 2 or 3 pints of milk daily, which he had done 
for many years. 

Case 18. This patient also had been a general painter for 40 
years. Beyond a moderate arteriosclerosis, he presented no symp- 
toms of plumbism nor had he had any such trouble at any time. 

Case 19. This patient was the only woman of the series. She 
was a housewife and attributed her double wrist-drop to the careless 
use of paint in painting her furniture. She had had 5 miscarriages. 

Case 20. This man, 52 years of age, had been a carriage painter 
for 25 years, and his only lead symptoms were attacks of cramps in 
the legs. He attributed his comparative immunity to careful cleans- 
ing of his hands with oil and soap. 

Case 22. This man, 36 years of age, had worked four years as 
a furnaceman, making red lead and in the drying rooms of white 



266 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

lead. His first attack of acute colic, vomiting and constipation 
occurred shortly after beginning work, in 1909, and was followed 
by another in 4 months and two more two years or more afterward. 
In each attack he was incapacitated for work for from 2 to 4 months. 
He presented a deep lead line, granular basophilia, hemoglobin of 
65 per cent, advanced arteriosclerosis and moderate cardiac hyper- 
trophy, neuritis and chronic nephritis. He was not syphilitic or 
alcoholic. Emphysema was also observed. He ate his luncheon in 
the workroom. Warning notices were posted, but few of his 100 
co-workers could read them and no prophylactic instructions were 
ever given them. 

Case 36. This patient, a man 59 years of age, had been em- 
ployed as a painter for 25 years without acquiring any symptoms of 
lead poisoning. Then for 5 years he had frequent severe attacks of 
lead colic. One attack incapacitated him for 51 days. When I saw 
him he was much emaciated, and stated that he had lost 56 Ibs. in 
weight since his attacks began. 

Case 39. This man, 28 years of age, had been a painter for 12 
years, and five years previous to admission to the Presbyterian Hos- 
pital had attacks of neuritis in both legs. Subsequently he had 
severe pains in the shoulder and elbow joints, and paralysis of the 
right arm and hand. He hSd abdominal cramps for six months, 
vertigo, headache, constipation and general weakness. During one 
day the temperature was 101 F., accompanying an attack of colic. 
In this case the localization of the pains in the major joints of the 
upper extremity was a marked feature. There were decided lead 
line, arteriosclerosis and a slightly enlarged heart. There was 
chronic conjunctivitis, so often seen in indoor painters. Basophilia 
was not present, but the leukocytes numbered 12,500,, and lympho- 
cytes 28 per cent. 

Cases 40 and 41. These two men had been employed, one for 
4 months, the other for 5 months only, in white lead converting beds 
and a dusty press room. Both had severe colic, vomiting, constipa- 
tion, lead line, and the one who had worked only 4 months had well- 
marked neuritis with numbness and tingling in the right arm. 

Cases 47-50. These patients were all laborers who had been 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 267 

employed in scraping old red lead paint from inside the double bot- 
toms of warships where no effort had been made to furnish protec- 
tion. The space between the inner and outer shells is about 3 feet 
in depth, and it is divided into compartments 4 or 5 feet square. 
The red oxid paint is originally laid on very thick, being nearly 
inch in thickness. The "sealer," crouched- on his knees and aided 
by an electric light, strips off the qld paint, preparatory to applying 
fresh layers. In single compartments several men are sometimes 
simultaneously working, and the dust, which cannot be moistened, 
becomes so thick that they scarcely can see each other. Forced air 
drafts are used in summer, which merely stir up the dust and make 
matters worse. No precautions had been given the men, and they 
were allowed to eat their luncheon on deck without washing their 
hands and to go home without changing their clothes. The men 
were not enrolled in the navy, but were employed under contract. 
All had had colic attacks with vomiting and constipation. One 
complained also of vertigo, headache, drowsiness and weakness. One, 
who had been incapacitated from work for 4 months by plumbism, 
returned to work, and 3 months later was obliged to give up on 
account of loss of power in the right hand and wrist-drop. One of 
these men, when he came to my clinic, had also persisted in returning 
to work after repeated attacks of colic .until his right hand and arm 
became so weak that for six months he had not been able to grasp a 
tool, and other employment which he had sought he had always been 
obliged to abandon on this account. These men were not alcoholic 
or syphilitic. It was suggested to the officers in command that the 
men be warned of their hazard, periodically inspected by a physi- 
cian, and required to wear some form of respirator. Also that fresh 
compressed air be forced into the hold and the dust aspirated by an 
exhaust worked by the ship's engines. This work, from the nature 
of the confined space, entered only by manholes and lying beneath 
the water level, is necessarily hazardous, and the only radical means 
of prevention of poisoning consists in the substitution of zinc oxid 
paint for the red lead. There should be no radical objection to this 
change. In addition to these 4 cases, records of 16 other victims 
were found by Dr. E. E. Pratt, two of whom had died. These cases 



268 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

are cited in his Report to the New York State Factory Investigating 
Commission for 1912. 

A case of lead poisoning from burning scrap tinfoil in a tinfoil 
factory was reported to me by Dr. Floyd, from the Out-Patient Clinic 
in Bellevue Hospital. The man had received no warning as to the 
hazard of his work, and after a year he had abdominal cramps, a 
lead line and wrist-drop. He stated that among his 14 fellow work- 
men two others had had wrist-drop. 

Prognosis. Death is rarely immediately caused by lead poison- 
ing, but it may follow within a day or two after inhalation of strong 
lead fumes. 

Whereas the immediate effects of lead poisoning usually merely 
incapacitate the artisan from work, the remote effects may prove 
fatal from advancing arteriosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, aneurysm 
or hemorrhage, or chronic nephritis. A few years ago I published 
an analysis of two hundred cases of gastric ulcer admitted to the 
wards of Bellevue and the Presbyterian hospitals which showed a 
striking prevalence of the disease where it occurs in males, as affect- 
ing metal workers or those employed as metal polishers, painters, 
typesetters, etc. Fully twenty-five per cent, of the cases among 
middle-aged males were in men of such occupations. It is possible 
that an early arteriosclerosis affects the gastric arteries among others 
and thus favors the occurrence of localized necrosis and ulceration. 
In some cases, without causing lethal lesions, the poison so lowers 
the patient's general health and power of resistance that he falls an 
easy prey to intercurrent infections such as pneumonia and particu- 
larly tuberculosis. The patient may have visual and auditory halluci- 
nations which are always of serious prognostic import. Some pa- 
tients having general paralysis with marked tremors, incoordination, 
exaggerated patellar reflexes, and almost complete dementia may re- 
cover in time. 

Lead colic, serious though it is, rarely is fatal. Tanquerel re- 
ports 9 deaths from it in 1,217 cases, and Andrali 5 deaths in 500 
cases. On the other hand, it is very 'obstinate, liable to recur, and, 
with varying intensity, may last for months. Among the 82 painters 
who died in Milan in 1909-10 there were 19 deaths from tubercu- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 269 

losis, 14 from nephritis, 5 from apoplexy and 6 from lead poisoning. 
(L. Devoto, "18 mesi di clinica dei verniciatori di Milano.") 

L. Devoto and L. Carozzi, of the Milan Hospital for Industrial 
Diseases, have reported a study based upon 2,567 compositors and 
1,053 printers in Italy ("Assoc. internat. pour la protection legale 
des travailleurs," 1912). Among the cases which proved fatal the 
causes of death gave the following percentages : Pulmonary tubercu- 
losis, 32 per cent. ; acute and other chronic respiratory diseases, 9.4 
per cent. ; cerebral hemorrhage, 9.2 per cent. ; cardiovascular dis- 
eases, 8.1 per cent. ; renal diseases, 4.8 per cent. In 1909, in Italy, 
the general mortality rate from tuberculosis among typographers was 
nearly double that in other industries collectively grouped. This has 
been a frequent experience elsewhere. 

In Germany, among 26,580 printers who reported illness to their 
Federation in 1909, 25.5 per cent, had diseases of the respiratory 
system, 10 per cent, of the digestive system, and only 10 per cent, of 
the nervous system, thus forming a marked contrast with painters. 

Of the compositors and printers who die from all causes, more 
than half do not live beyond the 44th year, so as a class they are 
short-lived. In the semi-decade, 1901-1905, in the United States, 
the total deaths of compositors were 2,488, of which 992 were caused 
by respiratory diseases, 293 by diseases of the circulatory system, 
and 95 were due to apoplexy a very high percentage. 

In an English table of occupational disease mortality, rating all 
occupied males as 1, leadworkers are rated at 211 and filemakers 
at 75, and in general the mortality rate of lead workers is from 90 
to 100 per cent, above that of other industrial employees, and their 
comparative mortality is 3 times greater than that of agriculturalists. 
Fully one-third of it is due to respiratory system diseases. 

Diagnosis. The diagnosis of lead poisoning is often overlooked 
by physicians unaccustomed to deal with its more chronic manifesta- 
tions. Prof. M. Allen Starr (Med. Record, Feb. 3, 1912, p. 205) 
writes that "many cases of loss of vigor and so-called neurasthenia 
are actually due to chronic lead poisoning." The fact that arterio- 
sclerosis and chronic interstitial nephritis may be produced alike by 
chronic lead poisoning, syphilis and alcoholism may give rise to 



270 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

some confusion or difficulty in determining whether lead is the more 
important influence in a given case. Frequently, if a patient has 
neither blue line on the gums, colic nor palsy, he is not regarded as a 
possible victim of lead poisoning, although in reality sclerotic changes 
due to it may be well advanced. 

Lead colic has been mistaken repeatedly for acute appendicitis, 
but in the former the absence of fever and leukocytosis, and the 
central rather than unilateral location of the abdominal pain, with 
possible presence of a blue line on the gums, should make the diag- 
nosis plain. 

Pyloric spasm with epigastric pain, tenderness, vomiting and 
constipation may also be mistaken for lead colic. In such a case 
the patient's history arid occupation should carefully be considered, 
and with colic there may be basophilia, anemia and a blue line on 
the gums, and possibly a trace of lead in the urine, to aid diagnosis. 

Gall-stone colic has been mistaken for lead colic. In the former 
bile is usually to be detected in the urine and jaundice may be more 
or less evident; moreover, the pain, tenderness and rigidity over 
the gall bladder region do not correspond with the central distribu- 
tion of lead colic pain, and there is noticeable absence of bile pig- 
ment in the stools 

In all these doubtful cases an extremely careful examination of 
the abdomen should be made as to tension, rigidity, pain on pressure, 
etc. Dr. Hamilton reports the case of a man who had four abdomi- 
nal operations performed in error, the correct diagnosis being lead 
poisoning; and, in 1911, I saw a similar case, with, curiously, a 
record of the same number of operations; the first for supposed 
gall stones, a second for supposed appendicitis which did not exist, 
and two others for "adhesions" ( !). The victim had had severe lead 
colic and had, when seen, well marked evidences of lead poisoning. 
Women sometimes refer the pain of lead colic to the ovarian or 
uterine region. Diagnosis is easily made when the typical symp- 
toms of abdominal cramp, weakness of the hands and forearms, and 
a lead line upon the gums are present. It is, however, important 
to make it earlier, before the victim is incapacitated from work. 
To this end the urine should be examined for traces of lead, and 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 271 

the blood for basophilia. Other symptoms to be sought for early 
and taken in connection with the patient's occupation are evidences 
of arteriosclerosis and chronic interstitial nephritis, persistent con- 
stipation, with a foul, coated tongue, secondary anemia, progressive 
weakness and emaciation, occasional vertigo, and pains of a neuritic 
type, especially in the arms and calves of the legs. 

Rarely lead poisoning with partial leg paralysis, incoordination 
on attempting to stand with the eyes closed, etc., may simulate loco- 
motor ataxia, but the ocular symptoms and alteration in reflexes 
which characterize ataxia are absent from saturnism. 

Prevention. In England legislation has accomplished great good 
in reducing the hazard of lead poisoning. Regulations formulated 
by the Home Office, including compulsory weekly medical inspec- 
tion of lead works in the 7 years from 1899 to 1906, reduced the 
number of lead poisoning cases 50 per cent. In smelting works in 
the vicinity of Newcastle these cases have been reduced to one among 
276 workmen, whereas in Illinois, without any restrictive legisla- 
tion, the ratio was one case among every 7 workmen! (Hamilton.) 

In England, wherever red and white lead are produced, the laws 
require that the walls be kept smooth, dust free and clean, that the 
cement floors be frequently washed, and, where lead dust is abundant 
as a necessary outcome of handling, that it be moistened by sprink- 
ling. These laws further comprise provision for weekly and monthly 
medical inspection, prohibit the employment of women and children 
in white lead beds or stoves, packing rooms and all other especially 
hazardous places. Respirators, caps, overalls, gloves, etc., must be 
provided by the employer, who must keep them cleaned and in 
repair. Before eating the hands must be washed in a weak solution 
of acetic acid, which forms a soluble lead acetate. Time must be 
allowed for washing before lunch, and good washing facilities with 
running hot and cold water, and in some cases shower or other baths 
must be provided, together with soap and individual towels, nail and 
tooth brushes. Separate lockers are ordered for each man's clothing 
and overalls. A lunchroom apart from all work rooms must be 
maintained. The lead drying stoves must be ventilated, and no 
man is allowed to draw Dutch ovens more than two days in a week 



272 DISEASES DUB TO IRKITANT SUBSTANCES 

or more than two hours at a time. The white beds must be watered 
before emptying and all rooms must be kept as clean and dust-free 
as possible. Workmen must be warned as to the risks they incur, 
and not be permitted to disobey the rules of personal care or to 
continue at work after once being seriously "leaded," or until cured. 
No food or drink is to be carried into the workrooms and the use 
of chewing tobacco is similarly prohibited while at work, and the 
men are urged to refrain from the use of alcoholic beverages. 

Dr. Hamilton, after a personal inspection of the lead industries 
in England, states {Jour, of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 
June, 1911) : 

"The men have usually individual towels, numbered with each 
man's number to prevent stealing. There are long porcelain-lined 
sinks with no stoppers, so that a man must wash in clean running 
water. Usually big cans of soft hand soap are provided. There 
are sprays for the head attached over the sink, and long nail brushes 
are fastened to the wall just above the basins. The great difference 
between our arrangements and these does not lie in equipment, but 
in the fact that the foreign workman's personal cleanliness is compul- 
sory, his employer is held responsible for it; the American work- 
man, usually a Slav, Italian, Greek or negro, may wash or not as 
he sees fit." 

In a smelting establishment in Hungary the incidence of lead 
poisoning cases among the workmen was reduced by proper ventila- 
tion and cleanliness in 18 years from 46.5 per cent, to 3 per cent. 
A similar experience, according to Boulin, was had in Silesia, where 
in the same period of time the percentage fell from 64.3 to 0.8. 

The following illustration of the necessity of thorough factory 
ventilation is given by Sir Thomas Oliver in an article on "Indus- 
trial Lead Poisoning in Europe" (Bulletin No. 95, United States 
Bureau of Labor, 1911) : 

"On one occasion in a dye works in Scotland during a severe 
winter the female workers closed, unknown for a time to the foreman, 
the ventilators on account of the cold, and they also stopped the 
running of the fan. An epidemic of acute lead poisoning, as unex- 
pected as it was at first inexplicable, broke out among the women, 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 273 

one of whom died from saturnine eneephalopathy. With the re- 
starting of the fan and the reopening of the ventilators no further 
case of plumbism occurred." 

All employees, as soon as they evidence the least sign of plumb- 
ism, should be removed to some less dangerous type of work in the 
factory or advised to seek some entirely different form of employ- 
ment, for one attack of acute plumbism often predisposes to others, 
although this is not always the case, especially if the workman, being 
warned by one attack, learns to take better care of himself. 

In Bulletin No. 44, 1903, of the United States Labor Bureau, 
this statement regarding lead works is made: "The thoughtlessness 
of the workman is very great. Men eat their lunches with unwashed 
hands in the factory itself, when a dining room is provided for their 
special use. Implements covered with white lead are held in the 
mouth because they are too indolent to lay them down. Hands 
covered with white lead are used in filling pipes and cutting off 
chewing tobacco." 

It is very important to allow lead workers sufficient time for a 
substantial breakfast, for many of the foreign employees are accus- 
tomed to different hours, eating a breakfast in the middle of the 
morning; hence they tend to carry sandwiches or other food with 
them to eat in the workroom, after beginning work, the stomach 
being empty. 

Medical inspection of the workmen in some of the lead works of 
this country is now provided by the employer, but, as ' 'leaded" men 
are often permitted to continue their occupation, it does not accom- 
plish all that it should. 

A complete system for the safe handling of white lead from the 
drying pans until it leaves the chaser as lead-in-oil paste has been 
perfected, and is now being regularly operated by the National Lead 
Company. In some of the lead industries in which dust is a very 
serious menace it is feasible to allay it by wetting, and in some of 
the processes in which lead paint is removed by chiseling or sand- 
papering it is possible to spray the surface first with some form of 
non-drying mineral oil. In Belgium a national law prohibits the 
dry sandpapering of paint. 



274 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

It is important to separate the dusty work of all lead plants from 
the non-dusty. For example, mixing of dry "lead colors should not 
be done in the same room in which cans or boxes are being labeled. 
It should not be permitted to ship leaky or dust-covered barrels of 
white lead. 

The introduction of modern machinery for handling white lead 
in the drying, grinding and packing processes is doing much to mini- 
mize these hazards, and Dr. Hamilton, as a result of her investiga- 
tions in Illinois, writes (Amer. Assoc. for Labor Legislation, Publi- 
cation No. 10} : "It is rather paradoxical and yet entirely under- 
standable that we have been able to find a larger number of cases of 
lead poisoning in the well-managed factories than in those badly 
managed. In the former the situation is faced frankly, the cases 
are sought out and treated, in the latter the dangers are ignored or 
minimized, and there is no effort to discover cases of poisoning, 
rather the contrary." 

Whenever possible carriage, wagon, automobile and similar kinds 
of painting should be done out of doors, or at least in open sheds. 
Oliver states : "In one large factory, in which 80 tons of white lead 
were used annually in indoor work, there were 163 cases of lead 
poisoning, while among the men employed in 'outdoor painting, and 
who used during the same period 237^ tons of white lead, there 
were only 50 cases of plumbism." 

In the distribution of type in the numerous small sorting boxes 
much dust accumulates which may be removed by using a jet of 
compressed air. Benches and tables may similarly be cleaned. 

A good illustration of the lack of interest of employers in caring 
for the health and efficiency of their employees sometimes met with 
is the following, reported by Dr. C. H. Snover (Jour. Amer. Med. 
Assoc., June 17, 1911) : A young girl of 16 years was employed, 
together with 15 others, in soldering cans in a condensed milk estab- 
lishment in New York State. None of them had received instruc- 
tion as to the risk of the work. This girl was attacked by vomiting 
and abdominal cramps, with weakness of the arms and hands, but 
managed to keep on with her work for two months until she no 
longer could hold the soldering iron. When seen by Dr. Snover 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 275 

she had pronounced granular basophilia and secondary anemia, 
albuminuria, gingivitis and olouble wrist-drop. He reports: "On 
questioning I found that another girl 'dropped' the solder, and it 
was not until next day that she told me about 'playing with the 
solder,' as she expressed it, by which she meant that she kept three 
or four of the smaller pieces in her mouth and chewed them nearly 
all the time during working hours. Occasionally she swallowed 
some of the smaller particles." 

As a further illustration of the way in which plumbism is often 
overlooked by failure of physicians to inquire into details of occu- 
pation is the fact that when first attacked by gastric disorder she was 
treated by another doctor who did not recognize the cause and made 
an erroneous diagnosis. 

The cases of lead poisoning for which damages were awarded in 
England, in 1908, under the Compensation Act for Occupational 
Diseases numbered 421, of which 191 were in metal extracting or 
working, 100 in the pottery industry, 16 in the printing trade, 4 in 
lead mining, and 1 in the textile industry. Of these 421 workers, 
407 were employed in factories. Four-fifths of the cases occurring 
apart from the mining industry were due to white lead poisoning. 

In Germany lead smelting was originally conducted without 
official regulation, and in 1885 as many as 73 per cent, of the work- 
men acquired plumbism. Seven years later, with the works under 
strict supervision by government inspectors, only 0.8 per cent, were 
poisoned. 

In Austria experience has been practically identical. In the 
Bulletin de I'inspection du travail, 1906, the example is reported of 
an Austrian smelting works where a new tall chimney with proper 
exhaust ventilation reduced the incidence of lead poisoning from 70 
to 3 per cent, In Austria, moreover, in lead factories without regu- 
lation, in 1886, 43 per cent, of the workmen acquired plumbism, but 
6 years later, under governmental control, the percentage fell to 6. 

In some of the Austrian lead color, majolica and metal com- 
position works the workmen are required, before cleansing the hands 
with water, to use a 3 per cent, nitric acid solution which dissolves 
any lead adhering to the hands. When lead solutions must be 



276 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

handled, as in dipping processes, vaselin should be smeared beneath 
the finger nails and rubber gloves worn. 

To protect from lead dust, the workman, before eating and on 
going home, should wash thoroughly the face, beard, nostrils and 
hands with warm soap and water, and "the mouth and throat should 
be rinsed with a watery solution of tartrate of ammonia before eating 
or drinking" (Kober), or a 0.2 per cent, solution of sulphite of 
soda may be used, or a solution of ammonium acetate (Wachter). 

Painters should keep the handles of their pails and brushes 
clean, and Kober suggests that they soften old paint with weak lye 
before scraping. A non-drying mineral: oil may be first applied in 
some industries before scraping off old paint. 

Rooms in which lead is melted in pots, as in type foundries, 
should be especially well ventilated, and fumes should be drawn 
away through hoods covering the pots and connected with powerful 
exhaust ducts connecting with a chimney. A current of air should 
be so directed past the workman as to compel the fumes away from 
him when ladling or stirring the molten metal. 

The composition rooms should be constructed without exposed 
rafters, shelves or other places on which dust may lodge. The walls 
and floors should frequently be washed and the type cases cleaned, 
when possible by a bellows or compressed air. They should be made 
with false bottoms of perforated tin, so as not to retain dust. 

Melting pots for the type metal should be well hooded and con- 
nected with an exhaust. The ordinary rules against promiscuous 
expectoration must be enforced rigidly. Close-fitting paper or linen 
caps should be worn as regularly as overalls in dusty lead trades, to 
prevent the hair from collecting dust which later is carried to the 
home. Cloths moistened with ammonium sulphid worn over the 
mouth arrest the lead fumes by formation of insoluble lead sulphid. 
Where lead has to be kept molten in open kettles, as in type founding, 
pipe molding, etc., the surface may be covered with tallow to check 
the liberation of fumes. 

The medicines which, rightly or not, have long been regarded as 
preventive of lead poisoning are acidulated drinks, such as solutions 
of citric, acetic and other acids, the occasional use of Epsom salts 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 277 

and of sulphur lozenges. According to Oliver, ' 'sulphur is a pre- 
ventive to some extent." Sodium hyposulphite in 5-grain chocolate- 
coated tabloids may be taken three times a day. They are recom- 
mended by Sir Thomas Oliver as a possible preventive of plumbism, 
being better than the sulphur preparations and sulphuric acid lemon- 
ade sometimes used by lead workers. Mucilaginous drinks are also 
used, and fat foods (butter, cream, bacon, pork, etc.) are recom- 
mended. 

The English laws regulating the manufacture of lead products 
such as white, red or orange lead require that the manufactory shall 
provide the employees with a suitable sanitary drink, such, for 
example, as the following: 

"Sulphate of magnesia, 2 ozs. ; water, 1 gallon ; essence of lemon 
to flavor." Drinking milk to the extent of a quart a day is strongly 
recommended by Karl Wachter ("Die gewerbliche Bleivergiftung," 
1908) as a prophylactic against lead poisoning. 

Individual drinking cups or, preferably, drinking water spouts 
should be provided and the employees should be cautioned particu- 
larly against drinking from any cup the rim of which has been 
soiled by contact with lead-besmeared hands. 

The following rules, formulated by Dr. Kenney for distribution 
in my clinic, have been adopted by the Kew York State Department 
of Labor with the statement that "the Department wishes to cir- 
culate these rules as widely as possible among all workers who may 
profit by them. They will be sent free to individuals, to trade 
unions, employers or any others who can assist in their useful cir- 
culation."

Instructions for Persons Exposed to Industrial Diseases, Especially Lead 

General Information 

(1) Dusty occupations cause colds and infections, irritate the nose and 
throat, and weaken you. 



278 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

(2) Fumes cause thin, poor blood, weak muscles, indigestion, and weak 
hearts. 

(3) All workers exposed to dust and fumes should have good ventilation, 
open windows, and protective devices, as exhaust fans, hoods and blowers. 



Metal Poisons, Chiefly Lead 

(1) Lead causes more poor health among workmen than any other metal; 
leads to indigestion and "colic," chronic disease of heart, bloodvessels and 
kidneys, and paralysis of the hands "wrist-drop." 

(2) Young adults are easily poisoned by lead. Young women often get 
the worst forms of it. 

(3) Lead acts slowly and silently by constant exposure, and causes illness 
without the workman's knowledge of his danger. He must, therefore, be 
most careful. 

(4) Lead enters the system through the nose, mouth and skin; that is, it 
may be inhaled as dust, in fumes, swallowed with food and saliva (especially 
if tobacco or gum is chewed), and absorbed by the skin. 

(5) In New York City those trades that specially expose the workers 
to lead poisoning are: white and red lead manufacturers, painters, plumbers, 
typesetters, file makers, storage battery makers, metal hardeners and polishers. 



Rules for Prevention of Lead Poisoning Outside the Factory 

(1) Keep general health always good by plenty of light, good food and 
fresh air in the home. Sleep at least eight hours every night. 

(2) Personal cleanliness must be had. Wash with warm water and soap 
daily, always before eating, and take at least one full hot bath a week. Re- 
move all dirt from under the finger nails. 

(3) Never chew tobacco or gum when working. The lead dust on the 
fingers is sure to be swallowed. 

(4) Don't drink liquor of any kind. Alcoholic intemperance causes at- 
tacks of lead poisoning, weakens the kidneys, and causes paralysis. 

(5) Never eat when you can avoid it in the same room you work in. 

(6) Always eat a good breakfast before going to work, especially drink 
milk. 

(7) Do not wear the same clothing on street or at home that you work in. 
Use overalls. 

(8) Have at least one good bowel movement every day. 

(9) Exercise in the fresh air. Live, when possible, some distance from 
work, and walk both ways. 

(10) Take good care of teeth and gums. A decayed tooth favors lead 
symptoms. See your physician before going to work in the lead factory, and 
at frequent intervals thereafter at' least once a month. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIK COMPOUNDS 279 

To these rules are added, in the State circular : 

Respirators are very useful and should always be used when working 
among lead dust or fumes. 

Keep the workroom clean. Do all you can to keep down dust. Do not 
get lead on your hands and clothes any more than you can possibly help. 

How Men are Poisoned by Lead. 

(1) Lead is poison to the body. It enters the body mainly through the 
nose and mouth. It may be inhaled as dust or in fumes. It may be swallowed 
with food or saliva (especially if tobacco or gum is put into the mouth with 
soiled fingers). Or it may sometimes be absorbed through the skin. 

(2) When lead gets into the body, it leads among other things to indi- 
gestion and lead "colic"; to diseases of the heart, bloodvessels and kidneys; 
or to paralysis of the hands, known as "wrist-drop." 

(3) Lead acts upon the body slowly and insidiously. Without knowing 
your danger you may be getting some lead poison into your body every day. 
If you are working with lead in any one of its many forms, you must there- 
fore use great care so as to protect yourself against it. 

(4) On the very first sign of not feeling well, see a doctor or go to a dis- 
pensary. Do not wait until you are too sick to work. The earlier you go to 
a doctor, the easier it will be to cure you if you are being poisoned by lead. 
BE SURE TO TELL THE DOCTOR ALL ABOUT TOUR OCCUPATION 
AND ITS DANGERS. 

The above rules are printed on the reverse of cards on the face of 
which the following statements are printed : 



Lead Poisoning 
Information for Workmen 

and 
Directions for Prevention. 

All doctors and hospitals are required by the law of 1911 to report all 
cases of lead poisoning to the Department of Labor. The results of the first 
year of reporting show : 

That lead poisoning is one of the most common of the diseases due to 
occupation. 

That two-thirds of the reported cases of lead poisoning occur among 
painters. 



280 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Lead Poisoning Can Be Prevented. 

It is preventable partly by the proper ventilation of factories and shops. 
Hoods and other mechanical means to take away lead dust and fumes are 
necessary. Respirators for workers exposed to lead dust are very useful 
and should always be used. 

But to a large extent lead poisoning may be prevented by the workmen 
themselves. Lead is poison to the body. Those who work with lead must 
themselves use the greatest care. Among white lead workers and others ex- 
posed to lead, the care which the workers take of themselves is of the first 
importance. 

Carefully prepared information for the use of those who handle lead in 
any of its forms is printed on the back of this card. By following this 
advice most workers handling lead in any form may escape lead poisoning. 

Read this advice carefully. Remember what you read. Follow the ad- 
vice given. 



A lead bill drafted in 1913 by the New York State branch of 
the American Association for Labor Legislation for presentation to 
the Legislature contains, among other provisions, the following for 
protection of workers in lead fumes, dust, salts or solutions : 

Employers must provide reasonable and scientific devices for the 
protection of their workmen against lead poisoning. These include : 
Provision of overalls and respirators ; the monthly (or of tener) ex- 
amination of all employees by a physician and registration of their 
condition of health; the exclusion from work of those found to be 
poisoned or otherwise unfit; the reporting to the State authorities 
of all cases of lead poisoning; the provision of dressing rooms and 
lavatories fitted with hot and cold water for each 5 employees 
smooth enamel wash basins or troughs, a nail brush, soap, and daily 
a clean towel for each employee, two sanitary lockers for each em- 
ployee, in one of which to keep his street clothing, in the other his 
overalls when not in use ; a time allowance at the employer's expense 
of not less than ten minutes before the lunch hour and after quitting 
work for the use of the lavatories and dressing rooms; a shower 
bath for each 5 employees exposed to poisonous lead fumes, dusts or 
solutions, provided with hot and cold water, movable floor gratings, 
and for each employee soap and two clean bath towels weekly; a 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 281 

time allowance twice a week for the use of the baths, of which a 
record shall be kept; prohibition of taking any food or drink into 
the workroom; a suitable lunchroom in which meals may be eaten 
only ; provision of accessible drinking fountains ; provision for carry- 
ing off all toxic fumes and dusts; smooth, hard floors in the work- 
rooms, to be kept clean, but not to be swept during working hours 
unless previously dampened ; all ore, slag, dross and fume to be 
kept separate from the general working rooms; mixing, weighing 
and packing of lead products to be done in separate apartments; 
and, when possible, such products to be dampened before handling; 
polishing and finishing processes to be kept dampened when possible ; 
all floors to be washed or scrubbed daily; flues to be cleaned under 
special precautions to prevent dust from escaping; all hoppers or 
chutes to be provided with adequate suction hoods and covered, as 
far as practicable ; conveyances for transportation of lead products 
to be kept covered ; no refuse to be allowed to accumulate where em- 
ployees are working; printed notices of all special hazards to be 
posted conspicuously, with directions for avoiding them, printed in 
languages intelligible to all employees, who, if unable to read, shall 
be specially instructed as to their hazard. This proposed lead law to 
contain also provisions for factory inspection, enforcement of its 
provisions and penalties for violation thereof. 

Dr. Edward E. Pratt made an exhaustive investigation of lead 
poisoning in New York City, in 1911-12, for the State Factory 
Investigating Commission. In a summary of his findings, published 
in the American Labor Legislation Review, vol. ii, no. 2, June, 1912, 
he mentions the following deplorable conditions: "Sixty-two of the 
109 workers ate in the same room where they worked; 22 never 
washed before eating, and 45 washed only in cold water; 73, or 
almost three-fourths, were never given oral instructions of any kind 
as to the dangers of their work or as to methods of preventing lead 
poisoning; 76 men never saw any posted instructions where they 
worked." In discussing this paper Dr. M. Allen Starr stated that 
he had questioned 30 patients who had come to his clinic in the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons within the year, and not one 
had received instructions as to the hazard of his trade. Such facts 



282 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

make clear the necessity of a widespread educational campaign to 
mitigate the evils of lead poisoning. 

SUBSTITUTES FOE LEAD COMPOUNDS. In many industries in 
which poisonous lead salts formerly were used they are being re- 
placed by less toxic lead salts or by entirely different substances. 
Thus anilin dyes are replacing lead chromate pigment in textiles, 
wall papers and artificial flowers; acids are replacing lead powder 
for finishing cut glass; in rubber manufacture lead sulphate is re- 
placing the basic carbonate; and this salt as well as zinc salts are 
partially replacing white lead in the making of paints. 

Guytou Morveau in the early part of the last century showed 
that zinc oxid might be used as a harmless substitute for lead car- 
bonate in the preparation of paint, but its use, except in France, has 
not become popular, although it is to a limited extent employed in 
this country. In France a series of bills have been defeated by the 
Chamber of Deputies making the substitution compulsory. On July 
20, 1909, the French Chamber of Deputies enacted a law intro- 
duced by M. J. L. Breton prohibiting the painting of buildings with 
white lead paint either inside or outside after July, 1914. 

Austria, in 1909, forbade the use of white lead paint for building 
interiors. It is also prohibited in several cantons of Switzerland 
and in the government buildings of Belgium. In Germany and 
many other countries are increasing instances of the local prohibition 
of the use of lead paint. Unfortunately many substances about 27 
sold as fancy paints under misleading names contain lead, and 
the buyer is not correctly informed regarding them. In this coun- 
try considerable zinc white paint is in the market, but there is, as yet, 
no compulsory prohibition of the use of lead paint. This attitude 
against the use of this paint has been brought about largely by the 
great number of damage suits and sick benefit claims instituted by 
the victims of lead poisoning. A pinch in the economic shoe is often 
a great stimulus to philanthropy ! 

Zinc oxid in glue water may be applied, and, after drying, zinc 
chlorid, also diluted in glue water, is used. The oxid and chlorid 
form a hard, smooth, shiny chemical combination, and this paint, 
for indoor work at least, is very durable and satisfactory. The dis- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 283 

coverer of zinc chlorid paint was paid 20,000 francs by the French 
Government, which had long sought a practical substitute for lead 
paint. 

1 Another zinc paint is made with addition of soda and silicious 
material with glue. Zinc sulphid mixed with barium sulphate, 
called "lithopone," is also used as a substitute for lead paint, but it 
requires nearly twice as much oil, and the oil must be refined or it 
will turn the zinc yellow. This requires more time for drying, which 
is a disadvantage. On the other hand, sulphur does not blacken it, 
as it does lead, and the zinc paint does not crack or blister. Many 
experiments made at the Pasteur Institute in Paris demonstrated 
the feasibility of substituting zinc for lead paint, and thereby saving 
many lives and preventing much chronic invalidism. In the paint- 
ing of castings with red paint much poisoning has occurred, but a 
filler and priming coat may be substituted, composed of silica, iron 
oxid and aluminum mixed with brown Japan drier. In works where 
this practice is followed there has been great reduction in plumbism. 
Lead which has been "fritted," i. e., heated with such materials as 
silica and boric acid, forms a brittle substance like glass which is less 
readily soluble in acids than most lead compounds, and may be used 
as a substitute for them in glazing. 

Treatment. IN ACUTE POISONING. The acute cases are usu- 
ally caused by inhalation of fumes, and hence evacuation of the 
stomach, which is usually recommended, or washing it with large 
draughts of water, is of little service. However, as some of the 
metal may be retained in the mouth and swallowed, there is no 
harm in pursuing that method. Alkaline carbonates of sodium or 
potassium and Epsom salts should be given, and castor oil is a 
suitable laxative. Milk should be drunk freely. Formerly, alum 
was much used. Cardiac stimulants may be needed, but artificial 
respiration is not required. 

IN CHRONIC POISONING. Hot baths to induce perspiration are 
very useful and the skin should be scrubbed with a stiff brush. 
They are often impregnated with some sulphur preparation which 
coats the skin with a black lead sulphid. For this purpose 4 or 5 
ounces of potassium sulphid may be added to a large wooden bath- 



284 DISEASES DUE TO IREITANT SUBSTANCES 

tub full of warm water. Sulphur vapor baths are also much used 
for a similar purpose. In the rock caves of Glenwood Springs in 
Colorado, which are filled with natural warm sulphur vapor, the 
Leadville miners formerly used to sweat out the lead which they might 
have absorbed. The benefit, however, derived in both these methods 
is through inducing perspiration. The addition of sulphur is not 
very scientific, for it cannot penetrate the skin or draw out the lead. 
The heat and moisture make the patient perspire freely, but the 
sulphur merely unites with the lead which may have been excreted 
by the perspiration, thereby making it visible as a black deposit, 
which is no doubt impressive to the patient ! 

For the colic tincture of belladonna (TTJ, v) is useful, and the 
following combination often gives relief : 

IJ Tincturae cardamomi composite 
Aquae menthse piperitse 
Spiritus ammonias aromatici, aa i 
M. Sig. Give 3 i every two hours in a wine- 
glassful of hot water. 

In severe cases a hypodermatic injection of morphin may be re- 
quired, but is to be avoided, if possible, on account of increasing 
the constipation. Chlorotone (gr. v) and chloroform water ( TTJ, xx) 
are also useful remedies. 

Hot poultices and stupes should be applied to the abdomen. 
Very hot normal salt solution may be used to irrigate the bowel, 
after previous evacuation with an enema of warm castor oil and 
soap suds. Oliver recommends the monosulphite of soda, gr. iii, 
t. i. d. Constipation may be treated in accordance with the gen- 
eral directions given on page 156, and the patient should be made 
to drink large quantities of water. 

It is customary to prescribe potassium iodid with the belief that 
it tends to form a soluble lead iodid which is more readily eliminated 
than the carbonate. Caution is also given not to administer more 
than 5 or 10 grains daily, lest so much soluble lead be suddenly 
formed in the system as to give rise to acute plumbism, but this 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 285 

danger is probably exaggerated. The iodid may be administered in 
milk. 

Gargles and mouth washes of sulphur and potassium iodid may 
be used and the teeth should be cleansed and kept in order. Neu- 
ritis should be treated as detailed under Neuritis. Lead palsy 
should be treated by massage and electricity, and an attempt should be 
made to reeducate the muscles by special movements. Artificial sup- 
ports and rubber bands may be fastened so as to aid the paralyzed 
extensors of the wrist. Strychnin should be given and iron and 
arsenic for the anemia. For the convulsions of lead encephalopathy 
the spinal canal should be tapped. Amyl nitrite and chloroform 
may be inhaled, and chloral hydrate and bromids may be given by 
mouth or rectum. 

MANGANESE 

This metal is used in the chlorin industry and to aid in liberating 
chlorin gas, in the liberation of oxygen, dyeing, coloring glass, charg- 
ing galvanic cells, and in making lacquer, varnish and oil paints, 
enamel, linoleum, and marbling of soap. 

When manganese dust has been breathed for a long time in ill- 
ventilated mills, paint factories, etc., serious and even fatal poison- 
ing may occasionally occur, although it is rare. 

Symptoms. The victim feels weak and there is loss of appetite 
and weight. He becomes drowsy and complains of night sweats. 
Serious nervous symptoms next appear. Cramps in the legs, numb- 
ness in the feet and rheumatic pains in the legs occur. There may 
be edema of the ankles. Salivation, vertigo, intention tremor of 
the muscles of the face and head, and a feeble voice with scanning 
speech are observed. There may be a staggering gait or the symp- 
toms may resemble locomotor ataxia. 

L. Casamajor described in 1913 nine cases of manganese poison- 
ing in workmen in an ore-separating mill. They exhibited inten- 
tion tremor, festination, pains in the legs and asynergia. The urine 
and spinal fluid were negative, as also was the blood. In one fatal 
case there were enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal cerebral 
ganglia. 



286 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

After chronic poisoning by manganese oxid hysterical symptoms 
have been observed, with sometimes more serious mental disorder. 
There are emotional disturbance with uncalled-for laughter or crying, 
and a tendency to walk backward (retropulsion). Incob'rdination in 
the movements of the hands, as in writing, etc., may sometimes be 
present. Finally the victim becomes unable to walk or to take ordi- 
nary care of himself without aid. 

Treatment. Treatment is preventive through adequate ventila- 
tion and cleanliness. (See pages 102, 91.) For the nervous and 
mental symptoms hydrotherapy, massage and promoting elimination 
through the bowels yield the best results. In many cases, if the 
symptoms are far advanced, amelioration is all that may be expected. 

MERCURY 

Mercury, both as a metal and in its manifold compounds, is one 
of the most poisonous of the metals used in manufacture, ranking 
in its evil effects with phosphorus and lead. Being volatile at low 
temperatures, it is readily vaporized, and, being capable of direct 
absorption through the skin and mucous membranes, it is liable to 
produce many cases of industrial poisoning in proportion to its use. 
The largest mercury mines are in the United States, Mexico, Spain, 
Austro-Hungary and Russia. In Almaden, Spain, convicts are sen- 
tenced to labor in the quicksilver mines. Formerly many of them 
were so soon overcome by the fumes from the smelters that they could 
work only one week in each month, but present conditions are much 
improved. The fact that mercury evaporates slowly at ordinary 
atmospheric temperature contributes to the ease with which it poi- 
sons by inhalation. The vapor condenses readily upon the workman's 
clothing, and Renk obtained 2.5 grains from the coat of a quicksilver 
miner. 

In other quicksilver mines the workmen often become poisoned, 
and Kobert ("Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen") estimates that between 
one and two per cent, acquire chronic mercurialism. The mucous 
membrane of the mouth becomes inflamed, red and congested. Rarely 
that of the nose is also involved. There is stomatitis, with hyper- 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 287 

secretion of thick mucus and salivation. As an early symptom, 
Sommerbrodt describes the appearance in the mucosa of localized 
white spots surrounded by pale blue or reddened areas which he 
calls localized pharyngeal hydrargyrosis. Wolf and Rb'pke have 
observed labyrinthine disease in quicksilver miners with Meniere's 
symptom-complex. 

In quicksilver mining, where mercury is extracted by vaporiza- 
tion and condensation, fine droplets of the metal may find lodgment 
in the skin or on the hair or clothing of the workmen. These drop- 
lets on oxidation in the air may be inhaled or swallowed and give 
rise to mercurialism. 

Mercury is much used to make amalgams in the extraction of 
gold, silver and other precious metals. 

In the quicksilver mines of Austria, in 1893, fully 54 per cent, 
of the workmen became mercurialized during the year. The propor- 
tion is much less now, although many cases of mild mercurialism 
occur. Ludwig Teleky, in an investigation there in 1909, found 240 
cases, six being severe enough to require hospital care. In 1908 
Gigliolis reported 58 cases of mercurialism among 700 miners and 
smelters of mercurial ores in Monte Amiata, Tuscany. 

Thirty years ago it was not uncommon for as many as 15 or 20 
per cent, of mirror makers to be affected by mercurialism, but 
the process has largely been superseded by the use of silver nitrate. 
Nevertheless, mercurial poisoning is still sometimes acquired in 
mirror making. When silver nitrate is used it is precipitated on the 
glass by tartaric or other acid. 

In a mirror silvering plant the Illinois State Commission on 
Occupational Diseases found that three deaths had taken place 
from mercurialism during a decade. The report states: "The men 
are unable to work at silvering for more than a few months before 
becoming completely disabled." 

In the making of barometers, thermometers and other scientific 
instruments metallic mercury is employed. It is also used in some 
of the gilding and bronzing finishing of various metallic articles. 
The red oxid is used in "anti-fouling" paints to be applied to ships' 
bottoms. 



288 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Ropke has reported ("Krankheiten des Ohres," p. 28) a case of 
mercury poisoning in a man employed in gilding swords. He com- 
plained of muscle pains, severe nervous disturbances, and "acute 
labyrinthine affection with Meniere's symptom-complex." There 
were vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, vomiting and loss of equilibrium. 
He recovered on abandoning the work. 

Dr. Teleky, in November, 1911, reported before the Gesellschaft 
der Aertze 14 cases of poisoning by mercury vapor among those em- 
ployed in making special incandescent lamps. In the process a 
high gas pressure is employed which is obtained through use of 
mercury vapor, traces of which remain in the lamps. Proper pre- 
cautions against poisoning had been observed, but, despite them, after 
a year of labor the workmen presented typical symptoms of mer- 
curial stomatitis, anemia, general nervousness and tremor. As a 
subsequent precaution after these cases were reported the lamps, 
before being hermetically sealed, were manipulated in air-tight 
chambers into which the workmen's hands could be introduced. 

The making of the large vacuum bulbs for X-ray apparatus pre- 
sents the same hazard. 

Mrs. Lindon W.- Bates reports 3 cases of mercurialism derived 
from making electric light bulbs, the vacuum in which is produced 
by mercurial pumps. 

Mercury is used in large quantities in a few manufactures, as 
in making fulminate powder for the caps used in setting off blasting 
powder. When impure the mercury may require redistillation, 
and I have notes of one case of mercury poisoning acquired in this 
latter process. 

In a cartridge factory the foreman of the priming department 
was affected by mercury poisoning so frequently as to lose about 
half the year's work for a number of years, until a proper ventila- 
tion system was installed, after which he had no more trouble. 

Mercury is used in the process of whitening cane for chairs and 
other articles, in coloring artificial flowers, making the toys known 
as "Pharaoh's serpents," in jewelry making and goldsmithing, polish- 
ing, stamping textiles with colors, making electric meters, making 
antiseptics (corrosive sublimate) and antiseptic dressings, rubber 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 289 

manufacture, making hair dyes and cosmetics, bronzing, and sole 
stitching of shoes by the Blake machine. 

In the electric meter industry in England, in one factory where 
Mrs. Lindon W. Bates examined 25 workmen, 22 had more or less 
mercurialism. 

One man died in New York City, in 1910, from chronic mer- 
curialism acquired while manufacturing rubber goods. In England, 
in a series of 94 cases occurring during a decade, 18 per cent, were 
due to thermometer making. The bulbs often break and scatter 
mercury over the floor. 

Water gilding or fire gilding processes formerly gave rise to much 
mercurialism. In Paris, for example, in the decade ending in 
1901, there were 15 cases of mercurialism from this cause treated 
in the hospitals. At the present time, however, galvanism has 
largely superseded other processes for gilding. 

Mercury is used in the manufacture of felt hats, and C. T. 
Graham-Rogers found as much as 2.6 mg. of mercury per cubic 
meter of air in certain fur cutting rooms in hat factories. Dr. 
Frank E. Tylecote, of Manchester, England, at the Fifteenth Inter- 
national Congress on Hygiene and Demography in 1912, reported 
20 cases of industrial mercurial poisoning, chiefly among hatters 
who presented tremor of the hands and arms and blackening of the 
teeth with gingivitis. 

Felt hat making is one of the most complex of manufacturing 
processes in which mercury .is employed, and the most thorough 
studies of the subject of poisoning in this process have been made 
by Mrs. Lindon W. Bates for the New York and New Jersey Section 
of the National Civic Federation (1912), and Dr. C. T. Graham- 
Rogers, llth An. Rept, Com. Labor, Sept., 1911. These investiga- 
tions covered a study of 122 cases. In Great Britain in 11 years 110 
cases were reported. There are many subdivisions of the felt hat 
manufacture, and those chiefly exposed to mercurialism are the so- 
called "carotters," "makers," "hardeners," and "sizers" (Fig. 45), 
whereas the finishers are more liable to pulmonary disorders, par- 
ticularly tuberculosis, from the felt dust which they inhale. The 
mercury poison itself also predisposes strongly to the acquisition of 



290 



tuberculosis, especially of the larynx. 'The Registrar-General's re- 
port for the past decade states that the tuberculosis mortality among 
hatters is 50 per cent, above the average. One reason for this is,

according to Stickler, the laceration of lung tissue by sharp, fine 
hair dust. 

In felt hat making the mercurial poisoning is mainly derived 
through the respiratory system, but the mercury may be conveyed 
to the mouth or absorbed through the skin. The vapor readily con- 
denses on mucous membranes from which absorption promptly takes 
place. In addition to the hazards of felt dust and mercury inhala- 
tion, the workman is subjected in parts of the process to fumes of 
naphtha and from poorly burning gas heaters, the nauseous odors 
of grease, and the dust of emery and sandpaper-finishing machines.

The detail of hat making is briefly as follows: The bundles of 
dried furs, which are rabbit, beaver, musk-rat, nutria, Belgian hare, 
or other skins, are opened, sorted and clipped a very dusty process. 
Forty thousand skins a day is the capacity of one plant in New 
York. They are then cleaned and the coarser hairs removed by 
hand or machine shearers. "Carotting," the next stage, is the sat-

mercury, acid and steam inhalation. 

uration of the fur with a solution of nitrate of mercury 11 to 20 
parts in 100 parts of nitric acid at 36 C. (Fig. 46). The solution is 
scrubbed in with a brush, thereby twisting the hairs and roughening 
them so as to increase their adherent or felting properties, remove 
animal oil and make the hairs waterproof. The pelts are then set 
in ovens on trays to dry at a high temperature, further left a few 
davs in a drying room, placed in bins and sprinkled with dilute acid. 
They are again dried and brushed, and cut by machines which rip 
off the skins, leaving the fur in masses. The fur is then placed in 



292 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

a picking machine which teases or commingles the hairs, which are 
then separated by a blower, the hairs falling into different bins, 
according to their specific gravity. Some of the hair is picked and 
blown 24 times. The fur is then ready for the actual hat-forming 
process. Measured quantities of it are thrown over revolving hollow, 
perforated copper cones three feet in height, on which the preliminary

shaping begins. The fur is then removed, after sprinkling with 
hot water, and rolled in burlap, or in a special machine. Another 
shaving removes any coarse hairs which still remain. Further 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 293 

treatment with dilute sulphuric acid and other processes makes 
the fur compact, reduces the size of the hat, stiffens it and blocks it. 
Derby hats are coated with shellac under steam pressure to stiffen 
them. Many of these processes are wet and accompanied by much 
evolution of steam. The hat, after having been steamed, is stiffened, 
blocked and ironed, 'smoothed or "pounced" with sandpaper or 
emery wheels, and singed. The brim is cut, shaped, bound, lined 
and the inner band sewed on. Final smoothing is done with grease. 
It is impossible to use respirators in the more dusty processes, because 
they so soon clog with matted fur, and a system of strong exhaust 
fans is the only remedy for this hazard. The carotters should wear 
gloveSj but the danger from mercurialism does not cease with the 
dipping process, for the dry fur dust which may later be inhaled is 
impregnated with mercury. Dr. Thorpe found in British hat fac- 
tories as much as 1.34 per cent, of nitrate of mercury in dust taken 
from the cutting machines, often operated by women and girls. 
Jungfleisch recovered nearly 0.5 per cent, of metallic mercury from 
the cones (Rogers). In the shellacking process wood alcohol is used 
as a solvent for the shellac. 

Symptoms. Workmen who acquire chronic mercurialism com- 
plain of increasing headache, lassitude, weakness, insomnia and mus- 
cular pains. They become very anemic, lose weight, and are prone 
to resort to alcoholic stimulants to give temporary relief to their 
mental and physical depression and restlessness. They have strong, 
gross muscular tremors of the limbs and facial muscles which they 
call the "shakes." The tremors also .affect the tongue and movements 
of the head, and the eyes roll from side to side (Teleky). There is 
albuminuria. The complexion is sallow and gray and the expres- 
sion listless. Chronic pharyngitis, a metallic taste in the mouth, 
chronic gingivitis, fetid breath, vomiting and diarrhea are also ob- 
served. There are pains in the muscles and joints. A condition of 
advanced marasmus and asthenia finally supervenes. The mouth be- 
comes dry and sore, the gums ulcerate, the teeth loosen, alveolar ab- 
scesses form, salivation is abundant. There may be muscular twitch- 
ing as well as tremors. I have seen the latter so intense as to re- 
semble superficially advanced paralysis agitans and the victim is 



294 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

unable to convey the contents of a spoon or glass of water to the 
month without spilling, for the tremors are increased by volitional 
movements, unlike paralysis agitans. From these symptoms the 
patient may recover after a long interval of cessation of work, but 
too often he returns again and again, each time becoming worse, 
until he becomes a hopeless invalid, with trembling lips and tongue, 
hesitating, whispering speech, a peculiar drooping or drawn expres- 
sion, a staggering, drunken gait and condition akin to senile demen- 
tia (Achille Monti, "Clinica delle malattie professionale," Milan, 
Ser. I, 1912). 

Salivation is not invariably present an important fact to re- 
member but usually the patient drools saliva to the extent often of 
several quarts a day. The salivary glands are swollen. The teeth 
are discolored and fall out. There may be caries of the jaw. The 
sputum raised in the morning is stained black with dust of fur. 
Asthma and emphysema may develop and chronic conjunctivitis and 
blepharitis are common. The paralysis usually first involves the 
hands and arms, and later may affect most of the body and legs. 
Mrs. Bates refers to a patient whose hands were so weak and tremu- 
lous that he had to hire a comrade to help him so that he should 
not tear fine hats in attempting to open them out. Such patients 
eventually become unable to feed or dress themselves. The tremors 
and paralysis are made worse by observation and criticism. In 
women who reach the stage of tremors and paralysis amenorrhea is 
common, or there may be miscarriage. If children are born they 
"are apt to be scrofulous, rachitic and mentally defective" (Bates). 
Convulsions may occur in childbirth. 

The prematurely aged victims of chronic mercurialism sometimes 
become so despondent as to attempt suicide. 

Mrs. Bates reports the poisoning of a boy of 14 years who had 
been employed in "sweeping the hat factory floor and feeding the 
machines with fur." He had partial paralysis of the arms and legs. 

In chronic poisoning mercury, which circulates in the system 
as an albuminate, is very slowly eliminated, and traces of it may be 
derived from the saliva, urine and other secretions. In post-mortem 
examinations mercury may be found in the liver and brain, and 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 295 

fatty degeneration involves the skeletal muscles, liver and kidneys. 

Mercurial compounds, as handled by miners, smelters, photog- 
raphers, felt hatmakers, etc., are sometimes so irritant to the skin 
as to give rise to a pustular type of eczema. Mrs. Bates found 20 
cases of dermatitis among the felt hatmakers of New York City and 
New Jersey. I have seen several more. 

Cases of dermatitis also have been described by Alderson (Cal. 
State Med. Jour., April, 1910) as occurring in this country in the 
manufacture of blasting caps, using dry fulminate of mercury. In 
one case an erythemato-papular eruption involved the face, neck and 
forearms. There was severe conjunctivitis. In the beard the erup- 
tion became pustular. The eruption is naturally most intense where 
the skin is most sensitive, and is favored by perspiration. The dis- 
ease lasts two or three weeks and is liable to recur, unless the skin 
is protected, for which purpose Alderson advises the following ap- 
plication : 

I Sodii carbonatis gm. 30 

Aquae destillatae, q. s. sat. sol 

Lanolini anhydrosi, q. s. ad c.c. 60 

M. Sig. : Smear thoroughly over exposed parts 
before going into fulminate rooms. 

Prognosis. The lighter forms of mercurial tremor and such 
milder symptoms as usually affect quicksilver miners may be recov- 
ered from after a few weeks. The hatmakers, however, becoming 
expert in their work, are very apt to persevere in it after the first 
warnings of mercurialism appear, and, after reaching an advanced 
condition of marasmus, anemia and paralysis, become hopelessly in- 
valided. They become an easy prey to some intercurrent disease or 
die from progressive inanition or in a hopeless condition of demen- 
tia or melancholia a premature senility (Ludwig Teleky, "Die 
gewerbliche Quecksilbervergiftung," Berlin, 1912). 

Prevention. Mercury workers should hold the head turned away 
from escaping dust and fumes as much as possible and wear pro- 
tective respirators. They should change their occupation frequently 



296 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

from the more hazardous to less risky divisions of the work, and 
should be examined by a physician systematically at least once a fort- 
night. They should be clean-shaven and keep the hair close-cut. 
Women should either cut the hair short or wear tight-fitting oilskin 
caps. 

Those employed in handling mercurial solutions, dust or metallic 
mercury should wash the hands frequently in sulphur water or in 
a dilute aluminum acetate or potassium permanganate solution. On 
leaving off work they should always wash thoroughly the hands, face 
and head. They should use individual soap, nail brushes and towels. 
It is most important to guard against looseness or decay of the teeth, 
and an alum or boric acid mouth wash should frequently be used. 
L. Carozzi ("Clinica della malatti professionale di Milano," Ser. 
I, 1912) cautions the workmen in mercury against the use of alco- 
holic drink, tobacco and fat foods (bacon, olive oil, butter, cream, 
suet, eggs, etc.) because fat promotes the emulsionizing and absorp- 
tion of mercurial compounds. In foreign manufactories the work- 
men use a mouth wash of potassium chlorate before eating. 

For the hazards of the felt hat industry Dr. C. T. Graham- 
Rogers suggests in the eleventh Annual Report of the New York 
State Commissioner of Labor, Sept., 1911, the following: 

REGULATIONS FOB THE EMPLOYEE 

There should be an attending physician at each factory. 

All employees should be examined physically every six months, and before 
returning to work after illness. 

All cases of illness should be seen by a physician and the result, directly 
or indirectly, of the industry should be recorded in a book accessible to the 
Department. 

A sufficient supply of wash basins (one to every five workers) with hot 
and cold water, soap and hand brushes should be provided. 

Time should be allowed for washing before meals and before leaving 
the factory. 

Overalls should be provided for males, and aprons and head coverings for 
females, the same to be discarded upon leaving the factory. Overalls, aprons 
and head coverings should be washed once a week. 

Rubber gloves and aprons should be provided for workers engaged in the 
carotting process, the same to be kept in good repair. 

No food should be brought to, prepared or eaten in a room where any of 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIE COMPOUNDS 297 

the processes are carried on. A room for meals should be specially set apart 
for that purpose. 

No person under eighteen (18) years of age should be employed in any 
process or room where dust or fumes are freely given off, or where shellac 
varnish is made or applied. 

All workrooms should be ventilated by mechanical means so that an 
abundant supply of fresh air may be maintained. 

Where dust is generated during the process of manufacture an exhaust 
system should be provided, consisting of hoods and piping connected to an 
exhaust fan of sufficient power to remove all such dust at the point of origin 
and in a direction away from the worker, the system to be operated during 
the time work is carried on. 

In all carotting rooms artificial means for ventilation should be provided 
and maintained to remove fumes from the ovens. 

All floors should be of such material as to be easily subjected to removal 
of dust by moist methods and should be cleansed daily. 

The mixing of the carotting solution should be done in a special room 
provided for the purpose, or after working hours. 

All rooms where wet processes are carried on should have an impervious 
floor and be properly drained. 

Workers exposed to mercurialism should be alternately shifted to other 
work so as to lessen the danger. 

Where illuminating gas is used to heat tools, apparatus or stoves, all 
fumes, gases or vapors generated during the processes of manufacture where 
such tools, apparatus or stoves are used should be removed from the point 
of origin by means of properly installed exhaust systems. 

Notices regarding the danger of poisoning from materials used, the symp- 
toms, remedy and preventive measures should be posted in each work room 
and dressing room, and in several languages. 

Treatment. The patient should be treated by means of hy- 
drotherapy, electric light baths to induce perspiration, diuretics 
to promote renal elimination, and potassium iodid. The mouth 
should be rinsed frequently with an astringent and antiseptic wash, 
and the gums should be touched with argyrol. Excessive salivation 
may be controlled with atropin (gr. 1/100, bis die). Tremors may 
be relieved somewhat by massage, but more by improving general 
nutrition with an abundant diet of milk, cream, eggs and broths. 
As the mouth is often too sore to permit mastication, all food should 
be given in fluid or semi-solid form. Dilute hydrochloric acid, nux 
vomica and one of the simple bitters, such as compound tincture of 
cinchona or gentian, may be prescribed to aid digestion and appetite. 



298 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

NICKEL 

Nickel has no specific toxic action, but its ore is often impreg- 
nated with arsenic, and the process of nickel plating, galvanizing, 
etc., involves the same hazards as those described under "Gold," on 
page 189. A few cases are recorded of poisoning from nickel 
carbonyl. 

PLATINUM 

Platinum paper was formerly much used in photographic print- 
ing. Its manufacture and frequent use as well were sources of con- 
siderable irritation to the mucosa and skin, so much so that many 
photographers have resorted to substitutes for it. In 40 studios 
examined by the Illinois State Commission on Occupational Dis- 
eases (Jan., 1911) 8 cases of poisoning were found, the symptoms of 
which are described as follows: 

"Pronounced irritation of the throat and nasal passages, causing 
violent sneezing and coughing; bronchial irritation, causing such 
respiratory difficulties as to preclude the use of the paper entirely 
for some individuals ; and irritation, upon contact with the skin, 
causing cracking, bleeding and pain." 

SILVER 

This metal is obtained from its ores by amalgamation on fusing 
with mercury or lead. Vapors from the two latter metals may be 
evolved in the process, but poisoning is rarely experienced in this 
manner and pure silver is inert. Arsenic and antimony are often 
associated with silver in ores and may be volatilized in smelting 
processes. 

Chronic silver poisoning, called, also, "argyria" and "argyrosis," 
is much less common at present than in former years. In fact, it 
is seldom met with except as a result of ignorance or gross careless- 
ness. One of my cases was that of a man who had been given a 
silver nitrate spray to use for chronic pharyngitis, without warning 
as to its continued use. He used it several times daily for many 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 299 

months and became of the typical bluish gray color all over the 
body which this salt produces. This, of course, was not an occupa- 
tional disease. When argyrosis of occupational type occurs the pig- 
mentation may be either universal or, more often, in localized 
plaques. The visible mucosa of the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx 
is also stained of a bluish hue. The ear drums may be pigmented. 

In 1896 Shubert reported several cases among Bohemian glass 
workers who used silver solutions to coat glass pearls, getting the 
stuff in some manner into the mouth. 

Koelech (Munch, med. Woch., 'Jan. and Feb., 1912) describes 
two industrial cases of general silver pigmentation of the skin in 
workmen who became affected either by dust inhalation or cutaneous 
absorption, or both. They cut silver leaf, laying it in booklets. One 
of them began work at 13 years of age and 5 years later first noticed 
the pigmentation, which grew steadily darker for 4 years, then re- 
maining stationary until she was seen in her 27th year. The other 
woman began work at 14 years of age and 7 years later first noticed 
the pigmentation, which had lasted until she was seen in her 50th 
year. Both patients had suffered from anemia and digestive dis- 
turbances prior to the onset of the pigmentation, but when seen they 
appeared in ordinary health. In some cases a blue line appears, as 
in plumbism, at the margin of the gums. 

The pigmentation of the skin in silver workers is due to the 
entrance of minute particles of silver dust beneath the skin, where 
they spread out to form bluish brown spots. Such pigmentation 
affects chiefly the exposed parts of the body, the face, hands and 
forearms. The more general argyrosis occurs only from absorption 
of silver salts which have been swallowed. 

The medicinal use of silver nitrate for chronic diarrhea and 
other internal treatment has become obsolete, and for external use 
in the eye, nose and throat, etc., it has largely been replaced by col- 
loidal preparations, argyrol, etc. It is still employed, however, in 
rectal irrigation in dysentery. Its trade use, beyond occasional dis- 
coloration of the skin, appears to do no harm, and the workmen 
in silver soldering, electroplating, etc., suffer from other metal poi- 
sons, acid fumes, etc., rather than from the silver itself. These haz- 



;WO DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

ards are practically identical with those of gold workers, and are de- 
scribed under the heading of that metal on page 189. 



TIN 

Tin is not of itself to be ranked among the industrial metal 
poisons, but in making tin plate, sheet iron is dipped in baths of 
molten tin and sulphuric acid. In some factories where girls have 
been employed to carry the wet tin plates their clothing may be 
attacked by acid fumes, and cases have occurred in which there was 
a tendency to falling out of the hair and blackening of the teeth. 

VANADIUM 

Since its discovery by Sefstrom in 1830 vanadium has found 
increasing use in the arts. The pentoxid enters into developing 
solutions in photography, the trioxid and chlorid are used in calico 
and other cloth printing, and the most important use is that of the 
trioxid in steel manufacture to make a malleable ductile product. 
One of the important steel products in which it figures is in making 
the chassis of automobiles. The pentoxid has been given medicinally 
for a reputed effect upon metabolism, in anemia, lues, etc. 

Symptoms. Vanadium vapor, as well as the dust of its com- 
pounds, especially those of the trioxid, is poisonous. Wearing cloth- 
ing which has been dyed by vanadium process has been known to 
cause toxic symptoms. 

Dr. W. F. Dutton has lately described the symptoms as affecting 
the lungs, kidneys and alimentary canal with serious results (Jour. 
Amer. Med. Assoc., 1911, 3.6). In a fatal case he found the lungs 
congested and the alveolar epithelium degenerated. The kidneys 
were hyperemic and in some other cases there has been acute hemor- 
rhagic nephritis. Enteritis was also present. The red blood cor- 
puscles are destroyed and a chlorotic anemia develops. There is an 
obstinate spasmodic cough with strong tendency to bronchial and pul- 
monary hemorrhage which may become fatal. The patient loses ap- 
petite, complains of nausea, fetid diarrhea, followed by constipation, 



TOXIC METALS AND THE1K COMPOUNDS 301 

loss of weight and strength. The vapor irritates the eyes and nose, 
causing conjunctivitis, rhinitis and pharyngitis. The urine presents 
albumin, granular and blood casts and blood corpuscles. The blood 
pressure is raised. Headache, tremors and neuroretinitis are pres- 
ent, with amaurosis and mental disorders. T. Cruikshank has pro- 
duced a similar group of symptoms experimentally in vanadiumized 
animals. The metal is eliminated in saliva, the feces and urine, in 
which its presence has been chemically detected. 

ZINC 

There has been much discussion as to the degree of toxicity of 
zinc. No doubt many of the toxic effects which have been attributed 
to it from time to time are due to the other metals associated with 
it in ores, which are principally lead, arsenic, antimony and cadmium. 
Sulphur dioxid is also present. In smelting as much as 2 or 3 per 
cent, of lead may be evolved. In addition various vapors and gases, 
such as sulphur, carbon monoxid and dioxid, are evolved during zinc 
smelting. Engraving on zinc plates is accomplished by means of 
chromic and phosphoric acids, and in one shop in which this process 
was conducted it was found that one-sixth of the workmen had been 
ill with symptoms which appeared referable to chromic acid (See 
page 171) rather than to any specific zinc poisoning. 

Zinc white, or zinc oxid, is being increasingly used as a sul> 
stitute for lead carbonate in the manufacture of paints (See page 
214) on account of its apparent harmlessness, although the handling 
and sifting of the zinc powder are very dusty processes and should 
be conducted only under proper precautions against dust inhalation 
(See Dust Prevention). 

Zinc smelters suffer more or less from chronic bronchitis and a 
moderate dyspnea which they term "asthma," and they are quite 
subject to tuberculosis. Of the 4,789 zinc smelters in Prussia, in 
1905, 50 were reported as poisoned; probably, however, these cases 
were due to mixed fumes of various metals. 

Lehmann and Lebord have given zinc white and various zinc 
salts to animals in large dosage without inducing toxic symptoms. 



Zinc oxid is much used in the making of high-grade enamels for 
painting walls, hospital furniture, etc. 

Symptoms. Zinc fumes disorder digestion and irritate the stom- 
ach, causing gastralgia, nausea and vomiting. The skin acquires a 
grayish pallor. Workers in the production of sheet zinc, zinc white, 
battery plates, etc., sometimes suffer from chills, like brass-founder's 
ague, according to French writers, but they also are exposed to lead 
and arsenic. 

The number of zinc foundrymen who at some period suffer from 
"founder's ague" is by some authorities stated to be as high as 70 
per cent., yet I have heard owners of such foundries deny that their 
workmen suffered at. all in this manner, and in E. R. Hayhurst's 
investigations in Illinois this ailment was found to be not very seri- 
ous. A typical attack of zinc founder's ague is described as follows : 
Some hours after quitting work there are irritation and constriction 
of the throat. The patient feels chilly and the body shivers and 
shakes. There are muscular pains and cramps and more or less 
perspiration. There is a metallic taste in the mouth and there may 
be vomiting and palpitation. There is a slight fever, 100-102 F., 
which lasts a few hours, and the duration of the entire attack is 
from 5 to 20 hours. Usually the patient is able to resume work the 
following morning, although the attack may be repeated several times. 
It is seldom that workmen are obliged to give up the work perma- 
nently on account of these attacks, for most of them acquire im- 
munity. These ague attacks occur while smelting pure zinc when 
it reaches the temperature of volatilization. Workers in copper and 
iron never have such seizures. Zinc ague is worse in winter, when 
windows are kept closed and ventilation is poor. The attacks are 
said to be accentuated by excessive use of alcohol and tobacco. The 
workmen in the smelters in summer often have severe abdominal 
cramps due to an excessive consumption of ice water. Zinc poison- 
ing may give rise to tetany with pain, cramps and spasticity of the 
muscles of the hands. It is most often met with in young persons. 

An interesting non-occupational but nearly fatal case of zinc 
poisoning in early infancy was lately reported. The child's nurse 
diluted its milk with water drawn from the melted ice in a zinc- 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 303 

lined refrigerator. The child acquired painful swollen joints, ane- 
mia and serious digestive disorders. How simple it would be to 
post a warning in all such receptacles against drinking or eating 
anything which has come into direct contact with the zinc ! 

Prevention. Prevention is essentially that described for lead 
poisoning on page 271, and for metal poisons in general. 

Treatment Treatment during the attack consists in drinking hot 
milk with bicarbonate of soda. The patient should go to bed, keep 
warm and subsequently take a cathartic. There is no specific treat- 
ment and zinc poisoning, unlike lead and arsenic, does not appear 
permanently to impair the health or cause destructive organic lesions. 

II. TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 

This subdivision is convenient, but is not an exclusive one, for 
the same substance may appear as a fume, a dust or solid, like phos- 
phorus, under varying conditions. For example, fumes of white 
arsenic and certain other substances, on sudden liberation from a 
retort, may be precipitated as a dust, and sulphur dioxid or other 
fumes may be so attenuated as to constitute a gas. 

The noxious gases, vapors and fumes which arise from various 
chemical substances not only affect the workman at his work, but, 
if he resides, as he often does, near to chemical manufactories where 
these substances are evolved in great quantity, the air which he 
breathes in his home may be contaminated as well. Professor 
Charles Baskerville, in the American Labor Legislation Review, 
vol. ii, 2, June,- 1912, gives the following comprehensive summary 
of these poisons: 

"The usual gases which give rise to complaint in manufacturing 
localities are the following: chlorin, which is emitted by pottery 
kilns and ceramic-products manufactories, and from plants for the 
electrolysis of halids; hydrogen chlorid, which is produced by the 
combustion of coal, and by pottery kilns, ceramic-products manu- 
factories (partly from the coal and partly from the clay), nickel and 
cobalt smelting, platinum refining, glass manufactories, fertilizer 
manufactories, the chlorid of lime industry, and alkali manufac- 



304 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

tories; sulphur dioxid and sulphuric acid, which result from the 
combustion of coal, coke, petroleum, and gas, copper smelting, bleach- 
ing operations, etc. ; fluorids and hydrofluoric acid, which are emitted 
from acid phosphate and heavy chemical plants ; hydrogen sulphid, 
from chemical works, especially those which produce ammonia ; car- 
bon monoxid, which is emitted from iron furnaces and from copper 
smelters ; organic vapors, from, for example, glue refineries, bone 
burners, slaughter and packing houses; zinc fumes from zinc smelt- 
ers and from brass foundries ; arsenical fumes from copper smelters ; 
phosphoric fumes from match manufactories; and carbon disulphid 
and sulphur chlorid from some rubber works." 

Lehmann has compiled the following table to illustrate the degree 
to which these poisons are injurious to the workman, estimated per 
1,000 parts of the air he may breathe :

Professor Baskerville also furnishes the following summary : "Of 
the gases which affect the respiratory passages arid eyes the most 
important are the following: illuminating gas, gases from coke and 
coal; carbon monoxid; carbon dioxid (in brewing, baking and the 
manufacture of aerated waters); chromic acid; chlorin; sulphuric, 
hydrochloric and nitric acids, and nitrogen oxids (in acid factories, 
heavy chemical works, engraving, etching, lithographing, etc.) ; mer- 
cury cyanid; heated lead; ammonia; naphtha and benzene (petro- 
leum refineries and dry-cleaning establishments) ; arseniuretted hy- 
drogen (copper refineries) ; sulphur, hydrogen sulphid, sulphur 
dioxid, and carbon disulphid; sulphur chlorid, nitrous gases, hydro- 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 305 

cyanic acid; smoke (fire extinguishing); and the vapors of various 
organic compounds and substances (tar, creosote, carbolic acid, petro- 
leum and its products, methyl alcohol, fusel oil, varnish solvents, 
dinitrobenzol, nitroglycerin, formaldehyd and formic acid, pyridin, 
etc.)." 

The methods of reducing the risks from inhalation of toxic gases, 
vapors and fumes, smoke, etc., are thus classified by Dr. George M. 
Kober in the Report of the President's Homes Commission, 1908 : 
"(1) Condensation; (2) absorption by water or chemicals; (3) de- 
structive distillation by heat in a closed vessel; (4) combustion of 
gases that can be burned; (5) forced ventilation and the discharge 
of gases into the air at great height." 

ACETALDEHYD OR ETHYL ALDEHYD 

This substance is a very volatile liquid, without color and having 
a decidedly pungent odor. It is developed in connection with the 
making of vinegar, and is used in the modern method of making 
mirrors with silver. Being highly volatile, it is irritant to the 
respiratory mucosa, from which it is absorbed, and causes increase in 
the pulse rate, weakness and sweating. It gives rise to conjunctivi- 
tis and coryza, cough and bronchitis. 

ACROLEIN 

This substance is a colorless fluid of acrid taste and pungent, 
disagreeable odor. It is developed in connection with the various 
organic fat industries, as in fat and bone-rendering establishments, 
tallow making, soap and stearic-acid making, varnish boiling and 
the manufacture of oilcloth and linoleum. 

Inhaled as a vapor, it irritates the mucous membranes, causing 
rhinitis, pharyngitis with constriction of the throat, and bronchitis, 
with itching in the throat, lacrimation and conjunctivitis. 

AMMONIA 

A number of trades are concerned with the handling of ammonia. 
The manufacture of the so-called "household ammonia/' so largely 



306 DISEASES DUE TO IREITANT SUBSTANCES 

used for cleaning processes, the making of the chlorhydrate, sulphate 
and carbonate of ammonia, the tanning of leather, the making of 
ammonia for general chemical and drug purposes, and the extensive 
use of ammonia for producing artificial ice and refrigeration, all 
constitute common sources for liberation of free ammonia gas. It 
is also liberated in the Schloesing process of making synthetic soda 
by mixture of sodium chlorid and ammonium bicarbonate. Am- 
monia may be inhaled by those who handle manure (especially horse 
dung), artificial fertilizers, and it is extensively used in cleansing 
various fabrics. 

Pathology. Experimentally ammonia produces in animals spasm 
of the glottis, and, according to Hirt, pulmonary congestion and 
emphysema. It favors the production of exudates. An atmosphere 
containing 10 per cent, of ammonia vapor may not be incompatible 
with life, but is irritating to the eyes and respiratory system. 

Symptoms. The conjunctiva?, when much irritated by ammonia 
vapor, may develop vesicular conjunctivitis, or a pseudomembranous 
croupous inflammation, with much pain, lacrimation and photo- 
phobia. The inhalation of ammonia vapor gives rise to instant 
spasm of the glottis and thus may prevent much of the vapor from 
entering the lungs, but the victim becomes asphyxiated, deeply 
cyanosed and dyspneic. Congestion of the buccal and pharyngeal 
mucosa takes place. There are sneezing and irritant dry cough, 
with subsequent bronchitis. There is an intolerable sensation of 
choking and burning in the throat. There may be violent vomiting 
and a rapid pulse. The perspiration acquires an ammoniacal odor. 
The poison usually is not fatal, but irritation of the pharynx, coryza 
and dyspnea may last for several days after exposure to the fumes. 
If large quantities are inhaled, however, the larynx and epiglottis 
may become acutely swollen, dyspnea is extreme and the victim may 
die in coma. It is irritating in less than one-thousandth part per 
volume of air. 

Treatment. Cold compresses and a saturated aqueous solution 
of boric acid should be applied frequently to the eyes, and demulcent 
drinks should be given to allay the irritation of the mouth and 
throat. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 307 

AMMONIUM CHLORID 

Sal ammoniac is used in galvanizing zinc, being poured upon the 
molten metal. The fumes which are thereby given off in consider- 
able volume are intensely irritating. It frequently happens that 
firemen are obliged to enter chemical works or other buildings where 
this substance is stored, and its liberation from bursting of the re- 
torts is a serious menace to their lives. The fumes cause choking 
and intense dyspnea, cyanosis and a feeble pulse. Fatal edema of 
the lungs may ensue. 

AMYL ACETATE 

Amyl acetate is used as "zapone," a solution of celluloid in 
acetone and amylacetate. Zapone is employed to lacquer metal 
ware and jewelry. It is also used in preparation of metal wire for 
incandescent lamps and in oilcloth and patent-leather making. In- 
haled as a vapor, it is absorbed, giving rise to nervous and circula- 
tory phenomena such as fullness and pain in the head, vertigo, numb- 
ness and palpitation. There are also nausea and vomiting. 

AMYL ALCOHOL 

Amyl alcohol is the chief component of fusel oil, and is used 
in preparation of fruit essences, amyl nitrite and anilin dyes. When 
inhaled as a vapor it gives rise to vertigo and headache, tinnitus 
aurium, faintness, lowering of blood pressure, nausea and vomiting. 

ANILIN 

Anilin is a highly toxic volatile substance derived as a by-product 
in coal tar distillation, and indirectly from benzin. Its toxic 
action is mainly through the circulation after inhalation, but if it is 
swallowed it is also poisonous. It may also be absorbed through 
the unbroken skin. There is recorded the case of a workman who 



died from anilin poisoning soon after spilling a solution of hot anilin 
over his body. 

Anilin, anilin oil and various anilin compounds are extensively 
used for coloring in the liberal arts, and cases of "anilinism" may 
be found in almost every anilin works. Bachfeld observed 63 cases 
during 9 years in one manufactory in Germany, and in the district 
near Diisseldorf 24 cases were observed in 2 years. In a manufac- 
tory in Elberfeld employing 5,000 workmen more than 260 cases 
have been known to arise within a single year. Grandhomme col- 
lected 109 cases in France in a period of 10 years. Anilin is widely 
used in the textile industries for dyeing, and in some trades, such 
as the making of wall papers and artificial flowers, it has largely 
superseded the us6 of arsenic compounds and other poisonous pig- 
ments. 

In cotton printing, for example, anilin is inhaled both as a vapor 
in the warm, moist dyeing rooms and as a dust in "napping" and 
finishing processes (See Cotton). Its toxic action is worst in the 
more highly heated rooms, as in drying rooms, where the temper- 
ature may reach 120 to 140 F. Its various combinations differ 
much in toxicity. Anilin blue is highly toxic, much more so than 
fuchsin. Wood alcohol is considerably employed as a solvent for 
the anilins. 

The vapor of anilin is toxic in a strength of 0.1 volume per cent, 
according to Hirt. 

Proust ("Traite d'hygiene") relates the case of a chemist who 
broke a flask containing a liter of anilin which spattered over his 
clothes. He promptly removed them, but notwithstanding became 
seriously ill for two days. 

The case is reported in Sozial TechniJc, 1912, vol. iv, no. 2, of 
an Austrian employee in color works who acquired anilin poisoning 
from eating his luncheon without previously cleaning his hands. 

Symptoms. Anilin poisoning may be either acute or chronic. 
The acute cases are mild or severe ("massive"). 

MILD ACUTE CASES. Anilin poisoning in mild acute cases, 
especially among new workers, is characterized by feelings of las- 
situde, weakness, vertigo, fullness in the head, and orbital pain. 



TOXIC METALS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS 309 

The eyes are dull, speech is slow and hesitating, and the gait is 
shuffling and uncertain, so that the patient may appear drunken. 
There is pallor of the face, and the lips and finger tips are cyanotic. 
There is desire for frequent micturition and the urine is very dark. 
The patient usually recovers after some hours in fresh air. The 
symptoms are always more severe in hot weather. In exceptional 
cases the patient has no subjective symptoms, but shows pronounced 
cyanosis. 

SEVEKE ACUTE CASES. When a large quantity has been inhaled 
or the workman's clothing has been saturated suddenly with anilin 
the symptoms become much more grave, and are : delirium or coma, 
epileptiform convulsions, general tremors, irregular, slow respiration 
and rapid, feeble action of the heart. There are hemolysis with ver- 
tigo, headache, nausea, vomiting and cough. The blood gives the 
spectroscopic band of methemoglobin, and the mucous membranes of 
the lips and mouth may appear almost black. The pupils are nar- 
row, but react to light. The patient may stagger and fall to the 
ground. The exhaled breath has a strong odor of anilin. Sensibil- 
ity is diminished. The pulse is small and feeble. Respiration is 
slow. In exceptional cases there may be strangury, with dark con- 
centrated urine which contains anilin. The neck may become rigid ; 
the pupils finally become dilated; the skin is cold, insensitive and 
bathed in perspiration; the face is pale and cyanotic, almost black; 
the temperature is subnormal. Such attacks may come with great 
suddenness. After some hours apparent recovery ensues, but in an 
hour or two the symptoms may all return. The workman may go 
home apparently well, and have an attack develop suddenly the 
next day. Final recovery is the rule, however,, leaving the patient 
with severe headache and sensation of fatigue. It is important on 
coming out of an attack to keep the victim awake (as in opium 
poisoning), otherwise he is liable to a relapse. Proust refers to a 
workman in Paris who suddenly fell inert with cyanosis and shiver- 
ing. He was given a bath of acetic acid and walked up and down 
in the fresh air by two comrades who kept him awake until he 
recovered. In still more serious cases the victim may suddenly fall 
to the ground ; the mucous membranes are black, the skin is cold and 



310 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

pale, the pulse is almost imperceptible, breathing is slow, and death 
may result in coma or convulsion. 

Hausermann and Schmidt reported the case of a workman who 
spent half an hour at work in anilin preparation in a closed compart- 
ment. Symptoms came on several hours later with fatal issue. Fatty 
degeneration of the liver has been reported. 

CHRONIC ANILIN POISONING. Chronic anilin poisoning gives 
rise to anemia, bronchitis and predominating nervous symptoms. 
Graham-Rogers, referring to anilin calico dyeing, says, "with few 
exceptions all workers in this industry are pale." The chief symp- 
toms are headache, tinnitus and disturbances of motility and sensa- 
tion. The mind is dull. Vomiting and diarrhea may occur. Pustu- 
lar eczema and ulcers may involve the hands, scrotum, and some- 
times other parts of the body when the clothing has been saturated 
with the material. The cyanosis, which appears to be always accen- 
tuated in hot weather, is known by the workmen as "the blues." 

Anilinism materially weakens the resistance against other dis- 
eases. Men employed in anilin works who handle anilin and other 
petroleum by-products are frequently subject to carcinoma of the 
bladder and testicles. In 1904, in 18 anilin works in Germany, 28 
such cases developed. There are preceding hematuria and strangury. 

In 1910 six more such cases were reported ("Gefahren der Ar- 
beit in der chemischen Industrie. Verband der Fabrikarbeiter 
Deutschlands," Hanover, 1911). Linenberger believes that a pri- 
mary chemical irritation of the mucous lining of the bladder in- 
duces the carcinoma which may form at the site of a polyp or some 
benign tumor. The carcinoma appears early, at between 30 and 
40 years of age. 

Prophylaxis comprises free ventilation by forced drafts of the 
workrooms, and the workmen should, when possible, be changed fre- 
quently to the least harmful departments of the work. 

Treatment. The victim should be taken into the open air and 
kept awake if possible. He should be sponged with acetic acid (or 
vinegar) and ammonium acetate, and strong black coffee should be 
freely given. In the mild cases saline laxatives should be given. 
Serious cases demand hypodermatic stimulation of the heart by 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 311 

means of digitalis, strophanthin, ether or camphor. Strangury may 
be relieved by suppositories of hyoscyamus and opium. Strong 
coffee should be drunk and oxygen may be inhaled. Alcoholic stimu- 
lation should be avoided. 

Warm saline solutions should be given by hypodermoclysis and 
by rectal injection. In extreme cases they should be given by 
venous infusion. Direct venous transfusion may be tried, preceded, 
if the pulse be not too feeble, by moderate venesection, of 10 or 12 
ounces. The management of the case is virtually that of carbon- 
monoxid poisoning. (Page 326.) 

ARSENIURETTED HYDROGEN 

Arseniuretted hydrogen gas is developed in soldering and treat- 
ing zinc and iron with mineral acids. It is liberated from ferro- 
silicon when the latter comes in contact with water. 

It is extremely toxic to the blood and dissolves the red corpuscles 
apparently without previous methemoglobin formation. (See Ferro- 
silicon.) It causes chills, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, vertigo, 
fainting, dyspnea, pains in the back, hematuria, jaundice, congestion 
of the liver and spleen, and sometimes fatal asthenia. 

BENZENE (COMMERCIAL OR IMPURE) 

The benzene of commerce is usually impure, and associated with 
it are methyl and phenyl carbylamins. 

Benzene may be absorbed by the hands if immersed in it or the 
vapor may be inhaled. The inhalation in a confined atmosphere in 
processes such as "dry cleaning" and scouring of clothing, gloves, 
etc., dyeing, making of rubber shoes and other rubber articles gives 
rise to toxic symptoms. Benzene is also used in quick-drying paints 
and in extracting fats to clean bones for fertilizers. 

Pathology. Autopsies which have been performed in fatal cases 
have revealed fatty degeneration of the liver, kidneys, pelvic viscera, 
heart and endothelium of the arterioles. In a case examined by 
Lenoir and Claude widespread hemorrhagic lesions were found as 



312 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

follows: hemorrhagic pleurisy, myocardial and subendocardial in- 
farcts, ecchymoses in the gastric and intestinal mucosa, hemorrhages 
in the optic commissure and at the base of the brain. In such cases 
the benzene oxidizes in the blood to form phenol-glyceronic acid and 
hydroquinon, with a resulting widespread hemorrhagic purpura of 
the skin, mucous membranes and viscera. Blood pigment is de- 
posited also in the lymph glands. 

Symptoms. Benzene poisoning presents three clinical forms, as 
classified by Proust ("Traite d'hygiene") : (a) mild acute cases, 
(b) serious acute cases, and (c) chronic cases. 

(a) Mild acute cases arise from inhalation of cold benzene 
vapor. The symptoms are those of mild intoxication, namely: 
headache, vertigo, nausea, formication in the fingers and weakness 
in the legs. These symptoms usually pass off promptly on coming 
into fresh air. 

(b) Serious acute cases arise from inhalation of hot benzene 
vapor. The symptoms are mainly nervous and vascular. The vic- 
tim has profound sensory and cerebral symptoms such as anesthesia 
or hyperesthesia, aphasia, amblyopia, muscular cyanosis, weakness, 
narrow pupils, hallucinations, delirium and epileptic convulsions fol- 
lowed by usually fatal coma, with subnormal temperature and feeble, 
slow heart action. There may be salivation and ecchymoses. 

(c) Chronic cases present varying degrees of toxicity. Glove 
cleaners and rubber goods makers may have polyneuritis. Various 
cases have been reported having such symptoms as facial paralysis, 
brachial monoplegia (a case of Guyot's), tremors and formication. 
There is some degree of loss of power in the arms, and especially of 
extensors of the fingers. The reflexes are diminished and there is 
incoordination with a "stoppage" gait. Mental confusion and loss 
of memory are observed. 

Absorption of benzene through the hands gives rise to localized 
congestion, tremors and ague. Benzene workers have occasionally de- 
veloped hematuria and vesical carcinoma. Among 1,380 benzene 
workers examined by the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and In- 
dustry, 9 had general poisoning and 34 had acne. 

A case of benzene poisoning in a linotypist was seen in the Milan 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 313 

Clinic, in 1911 (L. Carozzi), and Meisser, in 1907, reported the 
cases of three workmen who became unconscious while using benzene 
in a carpet-cleaning plant. Saupesseu, of Stockholm, in 1897, col- 
lected 9 cases of chronic benzene poisoning. Lenoir and Claude 
reported a fatal case with purpura. 

Prevention. Workers in benzene should protect the hands by 
coating them with glycerin or other insoluble material, rubber gloves 
not being suitable. Free ventilation is the only real preventive of 
poisoning. Benzene should never be used in confined air spaces. 
There is no special treatment for the nerve symptoms other than 
abundant fresh air and rest. In the hemorrhagic acute cases cal- 
cium chlorid may be given and blood transfusion might be tried, 
although it promises little relief. 

BENZOL OR PURE BENZENE (CH.) 

Benzol or pure benzene is used to make nitrobenzol, phenol, ani- 
lin, and, in pharmacy, to recrystallize many preparations after their 
solution. Although poisoning by benzol is rarely fatal, both acute 
and chronic cases are observed, chiefly among workmen employed in 
cleaning out the distillation apparatus in which the product is manu- 
factured. Benzol was formerly much used for cleaning, and pro- 
duced numbness and formication of the hands, but naphtha now 
largely replaces it. It is used to remove old paint and varnish and 
as a "primer" for hardwood. 

Acute Poisoning 1 . Acute poisoning results from inspiring a 
large quantity of the vapor in a confined atmosphere. The symp- 
toms are violent and alarming, consisting of vertigo, faintness, hal- 
lucinations, muscular prostration, nausea and vomiting, a quick, 
feeble and sometimes irregular pulse, cyanosis, cold perspiration, 
dilatation of the pupils, tingling of the fingers, and finally delirium, 
convulsions and paralysis. There is fragmentation of the red blood 
corpuscles and the hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin. The 
poison is eliminated through the kidneys, being converted into sul- 
phuric and glycuronic acids. Buchman has reported (Berliner klin. 
Woch., May 22 and 29, 1911) a fulminating case in which the patient 



died before many symptoms had time to develop, and an autopsy 
revealed only general visceral hyperemia. In such cases delirium and 
coma may precede death. 

Chronic Poisoning. Chronic poisoning gives rise to vertigo, head- 
ache, faintness, tinnitus aurium, loss of appetite and dyspepsia. In 
some cases an epileptiform condition has persisted. There are 
tremors of the hands and arms and dryness of the skin. In Baden, 
in 1908, two fatal cases occurred which suddenly developed hemor- 
rhagic purpura with hemorrhages from the nose and mouth and into 
the skin. Beinhauer (Munch, med. Woch., 1896, vol. 43, p. 915) 
reports a similar fatal case with parenchymatous degenerations. The 
pathological lesions of chronic benzol poisoning are mainly of the 
nature of fatty degenerations of such viscera as the kidneys and liver 
and of the bloodvessels. Ulceration of the gums and lips occurs. 
R. von Jaksch ("Die Vergiftungen," 1910) says that inhalation of 
benzol vapor may rapidly prove fatal. 

Two fatal cases of chronic benzol poisoning were lately studied 
in the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The victims were girls employed 
in a canning factory, sealing cans with rubber dissolved in benzol. 
They developed anemia, purpura and hemorrhages from the nose, 
lungs and other mucous surfaces. The leukocyte count in one case 
dropped to 500. Experiments upon rabbits produced a similarly 
extraordinary leukopenia. (See Diseases of the Blood.) 

This remarkable property of reducing the number of leukocytes 
in the blood, possessed by benzol, has lately led to its introduction in 
medicine as a remedy for myelogenous leukemia by Von Koranzi 
(Berliner klin. Woch., 1912, xlix, 1857). He studied the results 
of benzol poisoning in girls using rubber dissolved in benzol to make 
a cement employed in the manufacture of tin cans. The substance 
appears to stimulate the activity of the bone marrow. From 3 to 5 
grams are given daily in capsules, and may cause a fall to normal 
of the excessive leukocytes in leukemia. Overdoses cause vertigo, 
nausea, tracheobronchitis and gastric burning, with eructations and 
a taste of benzol in the mouth. Toxic erythema and pruritus have 
been observed. These symptoms may also appear when the vapor 
of benzol is inhaled in excess. Frank Billings and L. Selling de- 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOKS AND FtTMES 315 

scribe several cases of leukemia which were much benefited by the 
treatment, but the former describes it as a "two-edged sword which, 
if used carelessly, may produce grave aplastic anemia and hypo- 
plastic bone marrow." Wachtel has reported two cases of myeloid 
leukemia, in one of which benzol reduced the leukocytes from 102,000 
to 8,000. The myelocytes, however, remain relatively numerous. 
Hemoglobin is increased, as is also the number of erythrocytes in 
moderate degree. 

In a case of K. Jespersen (Hospitalstidende, Copenhagen, Ivi, 
no. 7, p. 153) the leukocyte count under benzol administration fell 
in 10 days from 250,000 to 61,000, and subsequently to 5,000, but 
in a fatal relapse it rose again to 750,000. The dosage did not ex- 
ceed 5 grams per diem. Unfortunately the remedy is not without 
danger, and tends to cause albuminuria and other unfavorable symp- 
toms. A physician who took the remedy himself for leukemia told 
me that he was made seriously ill by it. 

BROMIN 

Bromin is of limited use in chemical manufactures, especially in 
the making of drugs (bromids, etc.). 

Bromin vapor is somewhat less toxic than chlorin, and acts in 
a similar irritative manner upon the respiratory and digestive 
tracts. 

Symptoms. Acute bromin poisoning gives rise to conjunctivitis, 
coryza, salivation, nausea, brown discoloration of the mouth, choking 
sensation, hoarseness of the voice, vertigo, a dry cough, dyspnea, 
bronchitis, muscular weakness, and, in severe cases, convulsions and 
coma. 

Schuler has reported three cases of poisoning, one of which was 
fatal, and in all of which there were muscular tremors and spasm, 
with subnormal temperature. In fatal cases suffocation results from 
spasm of the glottis, which is accompanied by anxiety amounting to 
terror. 

In chronic cases there are dyspepsia, palpitation, dyspnea, coryza, 
cough and skin eruptions such as prurigo. 



316 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

CARBON BISULPHID 

This substance, which is a colorless, volatile, foul-smelling liquid, 
is highly inimical to life and may poison both those who make it and 
those who use it in any of the numerous industries in which it is 
employed. Its manufacture is conducted on a very large scale, 
many million pounds being produced annually in Europe. It is 
made by passing the vapor of sulphur over heated charcoal, con- 
densing and distilling. 

The most extensive use of this substance is in vulcanizing rubber 
and waterproofing materials. In this process the rubber is plunged 
into a solution of 100 parts of carbon bisulphid and 1 part of proto- 
chlorid of sulphur. The process has to be conducted in a hot room, 
at about 120 F., where there is much evaporation, and, further- 
more, the substance is easily spattered on the hands and clothing. 
The substance is used to some extent in the extraction of fats and 
textile industries. Cases of poisoning by this substance are much 
less common at the present time than formerly. 

Carbon bisulphid is absorbed through the skin and mucous mem- 
branes of the mouth and respiratory passages. A proportion of 0.5 
to 1.0 of CS 2 to 1,000 of air is toxic. As soon as the vapor is 
absorbed it transforms the hemoglobin to hematin, and the latter 
pigment, being eliminated by the urine, imparts to it a brown-black 
color when Fehling's solution is added. Elimination of carbon bisul- 
phid takes place also through the perspiration and lungs, but the 
process is very slow. 

Symptoms. ACUTE POISONING. Acute poisoning is rare. The 
patient complains of fullness in the head and ears, vertigo and dis- 
turbances of vision. He becomes as if intoxicated, is loquacious, 
and performs impulsive acts guided by hallucinations. He becomes 
pale and perspires easily. Dyspnea, palpitation, nausea and vomit- 
ing, with subnormal temperature and an odor of rotten eggs in the 
breath, are further symptoms. The pupils do not react to light and 
the extremities are relaxed. Anesthesia is present and reflexes are 
abolished. There may be slight elevation of temperature and deaf- 
ness has been observed. There may be convulsions, but the poison is 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 317 

rarely fatal, despite the severity of the symptoms, although a few 
fatal cases with profound coma are recorded (Wyle). The patient 
may recover with fair degree of promptness or a chronic condition 
of anaphylaxis may ensue in which the patient remains dull, de- 
pressed and has weak muscles. The urine, like the breath, may have 
a sulphurous odor. 

CHRONIC POISONING. The symptoms of chronic poisoning are 
.numerous and serious. In the milder cases they consist of head- 
ache, vertigo, confusion of vision, irregular pains in the extremities, 
dysesthesia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, insomnia and 
mental depression. In severe cases there may be dyspnea, paralyses 
of the legs and bladder, with painful micturition and sometimes 
albuminuria. The urine has a sweetish odor. The sexual func- 
tion is at first stimulated, later absent. There are eructations and a 
disagreeable taste in the rnouth, which may become inflamed. Anemia 
is common, but disturbances of the circulation other than slight 
palpitation are not common. Conjunctivitis is present and there 
may be erythema and acne. 

In chronic cases in which the poison has been absorbed slowly 
over a considerable period of time the symptoms are mainly motor, 
sensory and psychic. They may be divided conveniently into (a) 
a period of excitement and (b) a period of depression, and com- 
prise many neurasthenic and hysterical phenomena, with more seri- 
ous mental disorder. 

(a) Period of Excitement. The victim complains of headache 
and vertigo. There are exaggerated muscular excitability and con- 
tractures, cutaneous hyperesthesia and formication. The patient's 
manner becomes agitated. He is loquacious, restless, laughs without 
reason, has fits of violent anger, and shows mental alienation, so 
that the contact of his own hand feels like that of another person. 

(b) Period of Depression. The victim now becomes gloomy 
and morose. The muscles are weak and the gait is staggering. 
There are disturbances of vision and insomnia. Digestion is dis- 
ordered, and there may be colic, with flatulency, diarrhea and at- 
tacks of vomiting. The symptoms constitute a pseudo-tabetic state. 
Tremor, so common in mercury poisoning, is rare, but there may be 



318 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

paraplegia or hemiplegia and muscular contractures and atrophy, 
although the electrical reactions remain undisturbed. There may be 
slight facial spasm or tetany, which French writers term pseudo- 
tetanique. Sometimes there are severe muscular cramps. There 
are headache, vertigo, visual hallucinations and bad dreams, dull- 
ness, vertigo, sensations of fatigue or of shooting pains in the ex- 
tremities, and disturbances of special sense. 

Grave psychic disturbances are very common, occurring in more 
than three-fifths of the cases. The gait and speech are uncertain. 
Hemianesthesia is not uncommon and the nerves of special sense 
may be involved. Taste and smell may be diminished or absent. 
There is also often a variety of ocular symptoms such as conjuncti- 
vitis, epiphora, corneal anesthesia, amblyopia, paralysis of accom- 
modation, opacity and a condition suggesting albuminuric retinitis, 
with an atrophic, pale disc and pupillary inflammation. Other 
symptoms which have been observed in some cases are: testicular 
atrophy, premature cessation of menstruation or dysmenorrhea, and, 
quite rarely, an irregular melanoderma such as one may see in 
chronic arsenic poisoning. The patient may complain of a sensation 
of cold or anesthesia on immersing the hands in warm water. The 
final mental state is one of simple chronic dementia which follows 
the intoxication hysteria. 

Prognosis. Although death from chronic carbon disulphid poi- 
soning is rare, complete recovery may not take place, and psychic or 
other symptoms may persist. 

Prevention. Prevention is most important. Complete ventila- 
tion of the vulcanizing workrooms must be secured and the hours of 
labor should be restricted to rot more than 4 hours a day, or more 
than one week without an interval of change of occupation. In Eng- 
land employees are not permitted to work with carbon bisulphid 
more than 2 hours at a time, or for more than two such periods in 
a day. All workmen should frequently be subjected to a thorough 
physical examination. 

Workers in carbon bisulphid should be selected carefully, and all 
alcoholic, neurasthenic or hysterical subjects should be excluded 
as being especially prone to this type of intoxication when exposed. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 319 

Every care should be exercised to secure proper forced ventilation 
with exhaust ducts (See page 109). Overalls should be worn while 
at work. They should never be worn away from the factory and 
should frequently be washed. The facilities and rules for washing 
described on page 91 should be provided. Workmen should pro- 
tect the hands constantly by impermeable gloves. Poincare claims 
that hydrated lime and sulphur may be used for vulcanizing to 
replace the noxious carbon bisulphid, and it is by some such substi- 
tution that the best hope is offered of relief from a very serious 
hazard which has already caused much deplorable chronic invalid- 
ism ; for, although the results of this poison are not apt to be fatal, 
one can but feel that they might better be, rather than be allowed 
to produce permanent dementia. 

Treatment. Treatment is purely symptomatic, as no reliable 
antidote is known. The psychoses may require institutional care. 

CARBON DIOXID 

This gas exists both as a natural and artificial product. As the 
former it is found in volcanic caves; mines of all kinds, where, 
occurring with marsh gas, it is known as "choke damp" ; at the bot- 
tom of deep wells ; in sewers ; peat bogs and marshes ; deep cellars ; 
tunnels and in cemeteries. Water may rise in deep pits and force 
the gas out. 

Workmen employed in these various situations may be overcome 
by the gas, and others going down to rescue them may also lose 
their lives. In France five deaths have lately been reported in 
different places from this cause, and five more occurred in Begles, 
among workmen in sewers. 

As an artificial product or by-product in various industries car- 
bonic acid gas is very often produced in dangerous quantity. This 
may take place in sugar refineries, starch factories, paper mills, lime 
kilns, print works, beer vats, in large wine presses and cider cellars, 
where the gas is a product of fermentation. Men who enter charcoal 
pits to clean them meet with both carbon dioxid and monoxid. In 
smelting works, roasting ovens, gas works, the bottling of mineral 



320 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

waters, either natural or artificial, carbonic acid gas is evolved in 
excess. Seltzer water, for example, often contains 3 per cent, of 
CO 2 . 

Five per cent, of carbonic acid gas in the air may be breathed 
without inconvenience, but ten per cent, causes constriction of the 
larynx and dyspnea, and 20 or 25 per cent, gives rise to fatal asphyxia, 
for the gas itself is an intoxicant, besides replacing the oxygen of 
the air. These percentages are distinctly toxic, but the presence of 
10 parts of CO 2 per 10,000 volumes of air, when present in a close 
room, is taken as a maximum beyond which the air, being vitiated 
with other products of exhalation, becomes unfit to breathe. (See 
\ r entilation, page 100.) 

It is customary to lower a lighted candle into deep holes in 
which CO 2 may have accumulated, but it should be emphasized that 
a candle may still burn feebly in an atmosphere which will not 
support animal life. A safer test, therefore, is to let one of the 
lower animals, such as a pigeon, down into the hole, to determine 
whether the air is also respirable by man. 

Men employed in cleaning sewers, on submarine boats and in 
many other situations where CO 2 may be present in confined space 
may be overcome by this gas. In the historic prison, the Black 
Hole of Calcutta, in 1756, in a room about 6 yards square, 145 
prisoners were confined, and in 12 hours 122 of them were dead 
from asphyxia from their own CO 2 exhalations. 

A victim of carbon dioxid poisoning was reported in 1912 to 
the New York State Bureau of Labor. It is customary to "wash 
out" the carbon dioxid gas always remaining in the beer fermenting 
vats after the liquor has been drawn off, but the man entered a vat 
before this was done and lost his life in consequence. 

Symptoms. Symptoms of CO 2 poisoning may be acute or 
chronic. In acute cases, where the victim has been exposed sud- 
denly to a large volume of the gas, he falls to the ground uncon- 
scious, with complete muscular relaxation, deep dyspneic breathing, 
deep cyanosis and a feeble, quick pulse. If not immediately res- 
cued by artificial respiration he dies of asphyxia. 

Experimentally the gas has been used to produce anesthesia, for 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 321 

if oxygen be supplied with it its effects are not fatal, although they 
are too difficult to control to make this use of the gas satisfactory. 

In chronic poisoning there are anemia, cyanosis, headache, drowsi- 
ness, vertigo, tinnitus and general "nervousness," with anorexia and 
a sensation of heat in the epigastrium. Sodium binoxid in cold 
water liberates oxygen by decomposition, and the sodium fixes the 
CO 2 present in the atmosphere, hence this substance may be used 
in submarines and similar confined spaces to render the air more 
respirable. 

Treatment. Treatment of carbon dioxid poisoning consists in 
performing artificial respiration, giving oxygen inhalation and stimu- 
lating the heart action hypodermatically with camphor, ether, or 
strophanthin. 

CARBON MONOXID AND ILLUMINATING GAS 

This gas is both a natural and an industrial product. In the 
latter state it is produced in large amount incidental to many manu- 
facturing processes and is extremely toxic. It is formed in prac- 
tically all slow-burning fires and hence is evolved in connection with 
lighting and extinguishing furnace or oven fires. The danger in- 
curred through its presence is enhanced by the fact that it is both 
colorless and odorless. It is developed in all manner of subterranean 
work, and particularly in mines and tunnels, as a result of incom- 
plete combustion of dynamite and powders of different grades. It 
is liberated in such cases in connection with CO 2 and nitrous fumes. 
It is liable to poison workmen in caves, deep trenches, and plumbers 
looking for gas leaks. It is very abundant in coke furnaces and 
foundries, where. the men speak of being "gassed," and it may men- 
ace bakers, tailors' pressers and dressers of hats and cloth who use 
gas stoves. It is present in many establishments where small coke, 
charcoal or gas stoves are used, as by tinsmiths in melting solder, 
typefounders in melting lead, etc. It is developed in the Leblanc 
process of soda manufacture, in cement and brick works, and illu- 
minating gas works. In iron and steel blast furnaces temporary 
disablement from carbon monoxid inhalation is quite common. The 



322 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

waste products of imperfect gasolene combustion contain considerable 
carbon monoxid. 

The gas stove which stands out in a room away from a chimney 
flue not only consumes much oxygen, but imparts very deleterious 
products of combustion to the air. I know of no more debilitating 
condition than the prolonged occupation of a small room containing 
a lighted gas stove which is not set within a chimney, and I have 
met with many serious results from this cause. In an analysis which 
I made, in 1904, of 90 cases of acute illuminating gas poisoning 
occurring in my hospital services in New York, 18.8 per cent, were 
fatal, and many were due to the careless use of gas stoves. In the 
fatal cases, if the patient survives for a few days, acute softening of 
the brain occurs. 

Copra, or the dried cocoanut kernels from which cocoanut oil is 
made, and which is used also as an ingredient of curry, is stored in 
the holds of vessels plying between the Hawaiian and other Pacific 
islands and various ports. In cleaning out the holds of these vessels 
the natives are frequently overcome and sometimes fatally asphyxi- 
ated. Analysis of the gas which is evolved by this substance has 
shown it to be carbon monoxid. 

Carbon monoxid is developed in considerable quantity in the 
atmosphere of stoke rooms and the turrets of warships from powder 
used in firing big guns, in blast furnace rooms and in the manufac- 
ture of phosphorus and calcium carbid. 

Gas works are fertile sources of occupational diseases, especially 
of the digestive and respiratory organs, and rheumatism. According 
to Jehle, in Vienna 48 per cent, of all gashouse men become more 
or less ill during the year. In Berlin the percentage of illness per 
annum has reached 34, and in Berlin and Vienna per 1,000 work- 
men there are 1.5 deaths (W. Manauer, "Zeit. fur Gewerbehyg.," 
1911, s. 434). One of the chief hazards to which these men are 
submitted is constant temperature change. They become over- 
heated, stoking hot furnaces, and then cool off in the outer air, con- 
stantly going back and forth. As a result, they acquire rheuma- 
tism, influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia and inflammations of the 
throat and middle ear. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOBS AND FUMES 323 

They perspire freely and become thirsty in consequence. To 
alleviate thirst they drink large quantities of cold water and beer, 
etc., which gives rise to gastric catarrh and enteritis. 

They inhale much coal dust, smoke, steam and a variety, of toxic 
gases, in greater or less amount. Among the latter are acid fumes 
of sulphuric and traces of hydrocyanic acid, carbon dioxid and espe- 
cially carbon monoxid. 

Prof. W. T. Sedgwick has shown that in 50 years preceding the 
repeal of the Massachusetts law regulating the quantity of carbon 
monoxid in illuminating gas not a dozen cases of gas poisoning took 
place, whereas in the 20 years following its repeal there have been 
more than 1,200, or an average of 60 per year. This is a most 
striking demonstration of the harmlessness of the old-fashioned coal 
gas as compared with water gas. These figures comprise fatal cases 
alone, but there is always a large proportion of non-fatal cases, both 
acute and chronic, where the dangerous gas is freely used in manu- 
factures, as by gas stoves, gas irons and otherwise. 

Carbon monoxid is fatal to the lower animals if inhaled in 
quantity, and 1 part of CO in 250 of air kills a dog. For man 0.1 
per cent, of this gas in the air causes unpleasant symptoms and 0.4 
per cent, endangers life. One per cent, is almost surely fatal. The 
gas forms a relatively stable compound with the hemoglobin of the 
blood, thus interfering with the oxygen-bearing function of the red 
cells ; but it also possesses a second more important direct toxic effect 
upon the central nervous system of the nature of a narcotic and 
depressant, for these effects are manifest even where there is still 
a large percentage of red cells carrying oxygen, and they often 
persist long after the CO has left the blood. One of my patients, 
on the sixth day after illuminating gas coma, had 5,440,000 red 
cells and 95 per cent, hemoglobin with normal lungs, yet he died 
two days later in coma. 

Symptoms. Symptoms of carbon monoxid poisoning may be 
acute or chronic. 

ACUTE POISONING. The symptoms of acute illuminating gas 
poisoning are practically those of acute carbon monoxid poisoning, 
although they vary somewhat with duration of the inhalation and the 



percentage of the monoxid present which is not always easily deter- 
minable. Water gas contains 20 to 30 per cent, of carbon monoxid. 
With acute intoxication there are violent frontal headache, vertigo, 
a sensation of oppression, dyspnea, weakness of the legs, and con- 
vulsions, or a tetanic state may supervene and prove fatal. 

In my series of 90 cases above referred to a general blood count 
was made in 29, and in 18 of these there was a leukocytosis above 
18,000. In an infant the count was 52,000, and in 3 non-fatal 
comatose cases among adults the counts were respectively 44,000, 
32,000 and 31,000. Dr. Herbert S. Carter analyzed for me the 
chlorids and urea in 5 non-fatal cases, and found a considerable 
increase of these salts. 

In nearly all the comatose cases there was elevation of body 
temperature, lasting from a day to a week or more. In some cases 
there was a preliminary fall to 96 or 97 F. The fever is remit- 
tent, and the maximum in any non-fatal case was 104.8 F. In one 
fatal case it rose to 107 F. A case is recorded of 110F., with a 
pulse of 215. The pulse during coma is usually as high as 120, 
and may reach 140, and respiration is moderately accelerated. In 
one non-fatal case, however, it reached 62. Extreme dryness and 
redness of the mouth and pharynx are common, and vomiting some- 
times occurs. In some cases there was excessive perspiration. The 
pupils are variable. Often normal, they may be contracted, dilated 
or unequal. In two cases I observed nystagmus. Other occasional 
symptoms were tremor, convulsions, muscular twitching, rigidity, 
opisthotonos, anesthesia, and increased reflexes. These nerve symp- 
toms vary with the mode of poisoning. The color of the face is red, 
not dusty, owing to the line of methemoglobin, but as a late symp- 
tom the lips may be cyanosed. There are visual disturbances of 
various degrees. In the coma stage there is evacuation of urine 
and feces. 

Recovery is slow, and for some days the patient may suffer from 
mental weakness and confusion, with loss of memory. Paresis or 
spasm of the extremities may persist for several days. Cases have 
been reported of sequelae such as leptomeningitis serosa, acute mania, 
dementia, multiple sclerosis and several of multiple neuritis. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 325 

Bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia are common sequelae. In 
the non-fatal cases of the series the maximum duration of coma 
was four days, but it usually cleared up in from 12 to 24 hours. 

In 12 cases of the series autopsies were performed. The heart 
presented no lesions of importance. The brain showed congestion of 
the white matter, pia and arachnoid, in 6 cases out of 9 in which it 
was examined. The cerebral arteries are greatly distended and 
the typical lesion in cases in which the patient has survived long 
enough for it to occur is softening of the lenticular nucleus, which 
Schultze has pointed out is due to the peculiar curve of its nutrient 
vessels in which thrombosis frequently occurs. 

Plumbers who work in cellars where they may have to discon- 
nect gas pipes are exposed to its fumes, so that they may become 
dizzy, lose their sight, and become unconscious temporarily. 

Surgeon-General Stokes has stated that carbon monoxid develops 
rapidly in gun firing in the turrets on battleships, with the result 
that men who begin firing with a pulse rate of 72 have in 10 minutes 
a rate of 120, and in the stoke rooms the so-called "heat prostra- 
tions" are often due, he believes, to accumulation of this and other 
gases. 

CHRONIC POISONING. Chronic poisoning is characterized by a 
progressive, simple anemia, marked pallor, headache, vertigo, 
cephalalgia, gastro-intestinal disorder, a slow pulse, and a tendency 
to dyspnea on exertion and a subnormal temperature. There may 
be cutaneous irritation. The patient becomes mentally dull and list- 
less, the gait is slow, memory fails, and insomnia, which resists nar- 
cotics, follows. There may be anesthesia or partial paralysis of the 
extremities. There may be further psychic symptoms such, for 
example, as visual and auditory hallucinations and delirium of perse- 
cution. 

Karasek and Apfelbach, in a report on carbon monoxid poison- 
ing for the Illinois Commission on Occupational Diseases, made in 
1909-10, found in the industries of steel making and iron smelting 
that long-continued exposure to small quantities of this gas, liber- 
ated during smelting of iron ore with lime and coke, produces a 
polycythemia of between five and a half and nine and a half million 



326 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

red cells. The 240 men examined were many of them in poor 
physical condition, with reduced muscular strength. 

A case of multiple sclerosis from chronic illuminating gas poi- 
soning in a laborer in a gas plant has been reported by Dr. Walter 
Stempel (Zeitschrift fur Versicherungsmedizin, Jan., 1912). 

A patient who came to my clinic was employed in fitting gas 
ranges, and was in the habit of blowing into gas pipes to clean them 
out. He had frequent attacks of nausea and vomiting, with severe 
epigastric pain. He stated that four or five men who were asso- 
ciated with him in this work had similar attacks. 

Prevention. Free ventilation and prevention of leaks of gas are 
essential. Employees should be warned by circular and personal in- 
struction against the danger. No one addicted to the use of alcohol 
should be permitted to go where the gas is liable to be inhaled. 
"Such men occasionally sneak away to warm but dangerous places 
to sleep and there fall victims to CO poisoning," or, becoming 
slightly affected by it, fall into dangerous machinery. Of 22 men 
poisoned and rescued, three were burned and as many bruised. In 
another case the victim was burned to death. 

Rescuers should wear oxygen helmets and oxygen tanks should 
be kept always ready for emergency use, for rescuers otherwise are 
certain to be overcome. (See page 145.) 

Treatment. In acute cases the clothing about the neck and chest 
should be loosened, bystanders should give way and admit abundant 
fresh air to the victim and artificial respiration should be main- 
tained. (See page 145.) Oxygen inhalation may be given if the 
gas is obtainable. The body should be kept prone, with the head 
raised. The air should be fanned toward the patient. Ammonia 
vapor may be inhaled and flagellation of the chest with a cold wet 
towel may further stimulate respiration. If able to swallow, the 
patient should be given hot drinks such as hot whiskey and water and 
hot coffee. If the pulse becomes very feeble, hypodermatic stimu- 
lation is indicated. 

In illuminating gas poisoning and all the more serious cases of 
carbon monoxid poisoning from any cause the patient should be 
bled 14 or 16 ozs., and transfused with a like amount of normal salt 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 327 

solution or by direct transfusion of blood, if a donor can be ob- 
tained. Hypodermoclysis and rectal irrigation with hot normal salt 
solution should also be employed. Should coma continue more than 
24 hours it is desirable to repeat the bleeding and transfusion. I 
have known one patient recover after a week of coma, hence the 
importance of continuing treatment. 

CARBURETTED HYDROGEN 

This gas, encountered in coal mines, is seldom unmixed with 
other gases such as marsh gas, carbon dioxid and monoxid. It con- 
tributes to the general toxic effects of these gases, and, when inhaled, 
gives rise to asphyxia, hemolysis and fatal syncope. 

CHLORIN, CHLORID OF LIME, AND THE CHLORIDS OF 
SODIUM, POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM 

Chlorin gas is evolved in making Javal water, glazing bricks, 
making chlorid of lime from sodium chlorid by electrolysis, and in 
its use as a disinfectant in sewers, privies, to cover dead animals, 
etc. In the manufacture of writing paper, wall paper, etc., the 
pulp is sprayed with an alkaline chlorid solution and sulphuric acid, 
thereby liberating much chlorin gas. I once tried the process of 
disinfection by chlorin of one of my wards in the New York Hos- 
pital, but the gas escaped into neighboring wards in such quantity 
as to cause considerable inconvenience to the patients from coryza 
and irritant cough, so I never repeated the experiment. To pro- 
duce the gas, after sealing the room, a mixture of sodium chlorid 
and binoxid of manganese is made in a wooden trough, and a carboy 
of sulphuric acid is added, when free chlorin is evolved so rapidly 
as to make it difficult to run out of the ward in time to escape 
suffocation. 

The gas for commercial use is sometimes compressed in cylinders 
called "bombs." Chlorin is one of the most irritant of all the 
irrespirable gases, and is highly injurious in any strength above 
part per 100,000 of the air inhaled (Lehmann). 



328 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

According to Bernatzik, the vapor in contact with moist tissues 
of the body forms hydrochloric acid and other irritating products. 

The chief industry in which chlorin is liberated is the manufac- 
ture of chlorid of lime. By this process chlorin gas is conducted to 
lime solution in closed chambers. The men who enter the chambers 
to clean them out and those who pack the finished product may 
inhale both chlorin vapor and chlorid of lime dust. Other workmen 
who grind and sift the lime are affected by its dust. In bleacheries 
much lime chlorid is used. It is employed also in making dyes, 
chloroform and oxygen, as well as for calico printing, tanning and 
tinning. 

Various preparations of lime are much used as insecticides for 
the Gypsy, Brown Tail and Tussock moths, and in spreading dry 
lime about one should be very careful not to inhale the dust. The 
inhalation of chlorid of lime dust is exceedingly irritant to the lungs 
and liable to cause inflammation of them, with mucopurulent and 
bloody expectoration. 

In an article in Ranch und Staub (June, 1912) it is reported 
that in a lime mill in Germany there were attacked by pneumonia, 
one after the other, the proprietor and six workmen, three of whom 
died. They had been employed in transporting the substance in 
sacks and in unloading it before milling from freight cars. 

Physiology . It was shown by Hirt in experimenting upon ani- 
mals that traces of chlorin gas in the inspired air give rise to such 
irritation of the respiratory passages as to cause death in two or 
three days. The gas produces in them salivation, feeble respiration, 
purulent bronchitis and catarrhal pneumonia. In stronger dosage 
the gas gives rise to fibrinous pseudomembranous bronchitis, con- 
gestion and edema of the lungs. Chlorin poisoning may be either 
acute or chronic. 

Symptoms. ACUTE CHLORIN POISONING. In acute chlorin poi- 
soning the victim suffers from intense suffocation with cyanosis. The 
pulse is feeble, vomiting occurs and there is great prostration. Lewin 
has reported 7 deaths from this cause, and two distinguished chemists 
have thus lost their lives. In many cases of exposure to chlorin 
vapor, however, the victim is saved from death by the prompt, auto- 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 329 

matic reflex closure of the glottis. In less serious acute cases the 
symptoms are coryza, sneezing, frontal headache, dry cough, con- 
junctivitis, choking sensation, vomiting, a feeble pulse and perspira- 
tion. The face is at first red, later pale. Rarely hemoptysis has 
been observed. The cases of this type, mild at the onset, have 
occasionally been known to terminate fatally, but recovery usually 
follows treatment in the open air. 

CHRONIC CHLORIN POISONING. In chronic chlorin intoxication 
the workmen become accustomed to the bronchial irritation and 
asthma which affects them at first, and suffer more from malnu- 
trition, with anemia and emaciation. They are subject to attacks 
of gastralgia and may develop corneal ulceration. The teeth decay 
and the patient appears pale and sallow. 

In addition to the symptoms of poisoning due to evolution of 
chlorin gas from chlorid of lime, the latter substance causes con- 
siderable irritation of the skin, such as pruritus, eczema and ulcer- 
ation. Hyperi'drosis is common, and the peculiar eruption known 
as "chloracne," caused by working in the chlorin salts, is described 
under Chloracne. 

Treatment. There are no specific means of treatment, which 
must be preventive, by means of ventilation, and symptomatic, as 
occasion arises. Workmen who are exposed to inhalation of chlorin 
gas or lime dust often wear respirators containing sponges moistened 
with alcohol. In serious acute poisoning artificial respiration 
should be maintained, preferably through the laryngeal tube, owing 
to the irritation of the glottis, which may otherwise be closed in 
spasm. 

CHLORIN SALTS OF SODIUM, POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM 

In the preparation of sodium chlorid as a commercial product 
both from rocksalt and evaporation of salt water, the workmen who 
deal with the large evaporating beds or pans are subjected to a hot, 
moist, salt-impregnated atmosphere which tends to develop both 
acute and chronic catarrh. They also frequently have eczema of 
the nose and ears, which is due to irritation by salt dust. The chlorin 



330 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

salts of sodium, potassium and magnesium are irritating to the nasal 
mucosa of those who dig in the salt beds or work in the mills in 
which the lumps of salt are ground. Miiller (Vierteljahr. filr ger. 
Med. Ill, Bd. X, S. 381) examined 165 salt workers, and among 
them found 45 cases of nasal catarrh, 9 of recent ulcers of the nasal 
septum, and 45 of perforation of the cartilaginous portion of the 
septum. 

The manufacture of the chlorids of sodium, potassium and cal- 
cium by electrolysis is attended by evolution of vapors of irritant 
hypochlorites which may give rise to an erysipelatoid and acneform 
eruption of the skin of the face and thorax. 

DIAZOMETHANE 

This substance is a very volatile yellow gas used in methylizing 
processes. Entering the lungs, it causes e'xtreme irritation with 
ulceration of th*e bronchial mucosa. Intense headache is complained 
of, with great muscular weakness. Other symptoms resemble those 
of dimethyl sulphate poisoning. 

DIMETHYL SULPHATE 

This substance, a colorless oily fluid, is used in the manufacture 
of perfumery and in making methyl preparations. As a fluid it 
irritates the skin, causing serious sloughs. As a gas it irritates the 
eyes and respiratory mucosa, causing lacrimation, photophobia, 
conjunctivitis, and corneal edema and opacity. When inhaled it 
gives rise to an ulcerative bronchitis with danger of aspiration pneu- 
monia from sloughs. It causes pains in the neck and thorax, hoarse- 
ness, paralyses, convulsions and fatal coma. 

ESSENCES AND EXTRACTS: VOLATILE ESSENTIAL OILS 

Perfumery and flavoring essences and extracts containing vola- 
tile essential oils and similar substances, when inhaled in concen- 
tration, as in process of manufacture, may give rise to quite serious 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 331 

symptoms. Such are the odorant essences of lavender, spikenard 
and rosemary. The latter is especially powerful. The peeling of 
great quantities of oranges for making essence liberates an irritant 
volatile oil. Experimentally in animals these substances give rise 
to tremors and stupor or convulsions. In man the toxic symptoms 
do not become so severe, but headache, vertigo, tinnitus, irritation 
of the eyes and skin, and dyspeptic symptoms have been observed. 

Essence of vanilla resembles an aromatic aldehyd, and those who 
sort, clean and repack the vanilla beans in bottles in Bordeaux, where 
this industry is largely conducted, may complain of headache, ver- 
tigo, tinnitus, lassitude, insomnia, neuralgia, muscular pains and 
cramps, and sometimes of vesical irritation. 

Vanilla extract, as used by confectioners and bakers, irritates 
the skin if it comes in contact with it, and its fumes may give rise 
to conjunctivitis and rhinitis. Makers of perfumery are subject 
to a papular eruption of the face and hands and a generalized pruritus, 
due in some cases to a mite or acarus. They may suffer also from 
coryza, conjunctivitis and epiphora. In some cases they are obliged 
to abandon the work permanently on account of such continued 
irritation to which they cannot become accustomed. 

Prevention. To prevent ill effects workers in volatile oils 
should protect the eyes with glasses or goggles and take pains 
to protect the hands as much as possible by wearing gloves, 
etc. Overalls should be worn and frequently cleaned, as they soon 
become saturated with the oil. In the distillation of coal tar prod- 
ucts various hydrocarbons are separated in the form of both light 
and heavy oils which are largely used in the manufacture of colors 
for dyeing, etc. From heavy oils such as benzol an aromatic hydro- 
carbon series may be derived, as toluene, xylene bodies, etc., many 
of which are quite toxic. By reduction further products are ob- 
tained, namely, the amine derivatives, anilin, toluidin, xylidin, etc. 

ETHER 

Both ether and alcohol are used as solvents in a number of indus- 
tries in which workmen are constantly exposed to the inhalation of 



332 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

the vapors arising from these substances. Probably the ether is 
more toxic than alcohol. A form of smokeless powder used by the 
United States Government is manufactured with the use of these 
solvents combined, and a physician (Dr. Hudson) employed by one 
of the smokeless powder companies writes me that "the men em- 
ployed in the rooms where the granulating process is carried on 
inevitably inhale small quantities of ether and alcohol vapors in 
spite of the best ventilation that can be provided. They become 
weak and pale without suffering from any well-defined disease, and 
after a few months have to be shifted to some other work until they 
have recovered." 

ETHER, METHYLATED 

In making incandescent mantles they are dipped in a mixture 
of 60 per cent, methyl ether, or industrial spirit, and 30 per cent, 
methylated spirit in which collodion and camphor are dissolved. 
C. T. Graham-Rogers, Medical Inspector of Factories of New York 
State, writes of this industry: 

"The vapor arising from this mixture, if breathed to any extent 
by the workers, causes headache, sickness, anorexia, sleepiness and 
lassitude, symptoms which are experienced to a greater extent on 
first commencing employment. At one factory where the workers 
had to enter the hot stoves, heated to about 115 F., to carry in the 
mantles for drying and to remove the dried mantles, all seven work- 
ers complained of some of the symptoms described." 

ETHYL NITRITE 

This substance is evolved in the manufacture of fulminate of 
mercury, used for charging the caps for exploding blasting powders. 
Inhaled in concentration, it gives rise to very acute attacks of 
dyspnea and cyanosis. Although the symptoms are urgent and 
alarming, the victims usually quickly recover in the open air. 

FORMALDEHYD 

This substance is used as a gas for disinfection and in fluid 
dilutions as a preservative of anatomical and botanical specimens. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 333 

It is employed also in making dyestuffs, and by undertakers in em- 
balming bodies. 

When inhaled in concentration the gas causes disagreeable prick- 
ling in the eyelids and nose, lacrimation and increased nasal secre- 
tion, bronchitis and ulceration of the respiratory mucosa. The solu- 
tions of this substance cause diffuse skin lesions of maculo-pustular 
character. 

GASOLINE AND NAPHTHA 

GASOLINE 

Gasoline is used for fuel, cleaning purposes, as a solvent of cellu- 
loid, and in many other industries. The men who clean out large 
gasoline tanks may suffer from vertigo and asystole. Lately there 
have been brought to my notice a number of cases of chauffeurs who 
were overcome by gasoline fumes while cranking motor cars in small 
unventilated garages. They experienced vertigo, fainting and nausea, 
and one passed into coma, from which it was difficult to arouse him. 
The symptoms may not develop until the men go into open air. 

NAPHTHA 

Naphtha is obtained by treating with sulphuric acid the residue 
from certain products of fractional distillation of petroleum, such 
as gasoline, benzene and kerosene. The workmen employed in clean- 
ing out the distilling apparatus may be acutely poisoned by inhaling 
the naphtha vapor and dust from the naphthalin products. Most 
workmen, however, become accustomed to the irritation which at 
first may cause bronchial catarrh. Diminution in the acuteness 
of the sense of smell is common among them. 

Naphtha fumes are liberated in the preparation of waterproof 
cloth, the rubber industry, dyeing, trying out of fats and oils, and a 
variety of cleaning processes, although it is so very explosive on 
ignition that its use for the latter purpose has been supplemented 
to a considerable extent by other substances. In the making of rub- 
ber cloth, rubber shoes and patent-leather, in which the rubber is 
spread over a prepared surface, naphtha is extensively used as a 
solvent. It is employed also as a bath to disinfect clothing worn 
by those having infectious diseases, and as a solvent for metal polish. 



334 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Symptoms. ACUTE NAPHTHA POISONING. The symptoms of 
acute naphtha poisoning resemble those of benzene poisoning. Head- 
ache, vertigo, dyspnea, palpitation, nausea and vomiting are chiefly 
complained of. There may be mental confusion and death may 
result from hemorrhage from the respiratory mucosa or paralysis 
of the heart. Sometimes there are acute hysterical attacks with 
insomnia. Autopsies in cases in which the patient dies after a few 
days, so that morbid changes have had time to take place, reveal 
acute fatty degenerations of the most important viscera, heart, kid- 
neys and liver. 

CHRONIC NAPHTHA POISONING. Chronic naphtha poisoning re- 
sults in chronic bronchitis, tinnitus aurium, vertigo, headache and 
mental dullness. Both naphtha vapor and naphthalin dust are irri- 
tating to the skin, and Lewin found in American naphtha works dis- 
seminated acne of the hands, forearms and ears. Multiple papillo- 
mata have also been described on the hands and nose. The eleva- 
tions become hard and wartlike. 

A case of dermatitis and eczema of the hands caused by polishing 
metal bedsteads was reported to the New York State Bureau of 
Labor in 1912. The polish was dissolved in naphtha. 

HYDROCYANIC ACID, POTASSIUM AND OTHER CYANIDS 

Photographers may inhale hydrocyanic or prussic acid fumes 
derived from decomposition of cyanids. The fumes are developed 
in treating animal substances with strong alkalies, making red prus- 
siate pigment, making coal gas, extracting the lees of manioc for 
indigo, making fulminate of mercury, potassium ferrocyanid and 
synthetic soda, and in making the so-called "Pharaoh's serpents," 
which, when ignited, form actively twisting coils. The acid is also 
evolved in electroplating. 

Pathology. The fumes of hydrocyanic acid, unlike most of the 
acid fumes, do not irritate the respiratory mucosa, but, being promptly 
absorbed, form a fixed compound with the hemoglobin of the blood. 

Symptoms. ACUTE POISONING. Large doses are instantly fatal. 
The discoverer of the acid died from its effects in his laboratory. In 



TOXIC GASES, VAPOES AND FUMES 335 

non-fatal doses the poison produces marked pallor, vertigo, great 
prostration, a feeble pulse and voice, and cold sweats. The urine 
and the exhaled breath may possess an odor of bitter almonds. There 
is itching in the nose, with watery discharge and irritation of the 
throat. 

Potassium and other cyanids were formerly a common source of 
poisoning among photo-engravers, who acquire it with great regular- 
ity after a few months' continuous work in the poison. Acute 
poisoning may be fatal within twenty-four hours. With present 
regulations in the industry and better understanding of the risks, 
comparatively few cases occur. 

CHKONIC POISONING. With chronic poisoning there are head- 
ache, nausea, vomiting, muscular prostration, enfeeblement of the 
heart and reduced blood pressure. 

Potassium cyanid caused the death of a lad in New York State 
in 1912 who, as a clockmaker's apprentice, had used it in hardening 
steel, and a blacksmith also died from using it in welding iron. In 
the Bulletin of the New York State Labor Bureau, 1912, are reported 
five cases of skin diseases of the hands and arms due to potassium 
cyanid used in plating typewriters. The cyanid solutions are used 
hot, sometimes to 110 F. Among 250 men employed in Illinois in 
plating of. brass by cyanid processes, seven had ulcers of the hands 
from dipping them in the plating solutions. 

The cyanids are further used in making oxalic acid, in dyeing 
and printing cloth, making phosphoric acid from bones, extracting 
gold, and making cyanogen. 

Treatment. Hypodermatic stimulation of the heart should be 
resorted to with ether or camphor in oil, and ^4 mg. of strophanthin 
should be given by deep intermuscular injection. The body should 
be protected with hot blankets and hot water bottles and hot alco- 
holic stimulants should be given by mouth. 

IODIN 

lodin vapor is liberated in certain chemical processes, as in the 
manufacture of drugs, such as the tincture of iodin, and may affect 



336 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

workmen so employed. It irritates the respiratory system but to 
much less degree than either chlorin or bromin, and does not cause 
death as these other gases may do. 

Symptoms. The so-called "iodin fever" consists of a sort of 
intoxication, with vertigo and headache. There may be coryza, bron- 
chitis, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. In chronic cases there are diges- 
tive disorders, with malnutrition, anemia, erythema, acne, blebs, and 
atrophy of the testicles. 

LYDOL AND TRITON 

These are high explosives of low-freezing property. Their toxic 
effects are practically identical and they act strongly as hemolytic 
agents. 

Symptoms. Lydol varies considerably in strength and conse- 
quently in the symptoms produced. Dr. W. G. Hudson, one of my 
former laboratory assistants, has furnished an interesting account of 
experiments with these substances in a manufactory of high explo- 
sives. He describes the symptoms produced in workmen by lydol as 
follows : they suffer from severe headache, pains in the back and great 
weakness of the extremities. The face becomes deeply cyanosed and 
there is a yellow pallor of the skin. The urine is colored dark red. 
The victims appear "half -strangled" and are often obliged to quit work 
for several weeks. Hudson proved by experiments on himself that 
the poison acts both through inhalation of vapors and by contact with 
the skin. The blood gives the spectrum of methemoglobin some- 
times but not invariably. The erythrocytes are crenated, fragmented 
and vacuolated, and irritation types of leukocytes are observed in 
considerable number. These symptoms appeared to vary with the 
quality of the mixture. Workmen whose clothing becomes saturated 
with the fluid lydol or with triton dust develop these symptoms very 
promptly. A series of experiments upon the lower animals gave 
identical results, often proving fatal. In one case triton produced a 
temperature of 102 F. 

A peculiarity of the effect of triton is the retardation of develop- 
ment of symptoms. Dr. Hudson, who was himself exposed for two 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 337 

hours while experimenting, did not develop serious symptoms for 
two or three days. Convalescence is correspondingly slow. 

Treatment. The workman should take a hot bath and scrub the 
body thoroughly with pumice stone or a granular soap, to cleanse 
the skin of all possible impurities. He should discard his working 
clothes for clean ones and live in the open air. He should drink 
several quarts of warm milk a day, which is a good diuretic by virtue 
of its lactic acid. It is absolutely essential to avoid all alcoholic 
drinks. If the hemolysis threatens life, direct blood transfusion 
should be performed. 

As a preventive of serious poisoning frequent blood examina- 
tions of the workmen should be made and, if vacuolated or otherwise 
deformed erythrocytes are present, work should be dropped tem- 
porarily. 

Dr. Hudson recommends the introduction of an air shaft above 
the workman's head, arranged to direct a current of fresh air down- 
ward to an exhaust duct in the floor, covered by a grating upon which 
he stands. 

METHYL ALCOHOL 

Wood or methyl alcohol, called also "wood spirit," is used as a 
solvent for shellac and gums in a variety of varnishes, in a num- 
ber of chemical industries, and to some extent in leather manufacture. 
It may be produced as an impurity of distillation of various empy- 
reumatic hydrocarbons. It is used by workers in special industries, 
as by piano makers, felt and straw hat makers, workers in anilins 
and silk stuffs. When pure it is almost free from odor, taste or 
color. As a solvent for shellac it may be used in full strength, the 
shellac filling about 40 per cent, of the mixture, or it is added in 
10 per cent, strength to grain or ethyl alcohol to make "denatured" 
alcohol, and then used as a solvent. Impure methyl achohol (and 
much of the commercial stuff is impure) contains acetone, ketone 
and aldehyd. Denatured alcohol also sometimes has 0.5 per cent, 
benzene or pyridin added to it. The wood alcohol varnishes, besides 
being cheaper, dry quicker than those made with ethyl alcohol, be- 
cause wood alcohol is more volatile, having a lower boiling point. 



338 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

Much of the varnish used, however, contains a compromise dena- 
tured alcohol made with only 5 per cent, wood alcohol. Owing to 
its volatility wood alcohol readily mixes with air at ordinary room 
temperature and such mixture is highly explosive. 

This form of alcohol is very slowly eliminated from the system 
and its retention is associated with formation of formic acid and 
formaldehyd. (Pohl.) Xicloux and Placet have shown (Jour, de 
physiol. et de pathol. gen., 1912, xiv, 916) that wood alcohol is solu- 
ble in such lipoid substances as are found in nerve tissues, and after 
death the brain retains a large percentage of this alcohol, a highly 
differentiated nerve substance like that of the optic nerve is there- 
fore particularly liable to be affected by it. 

Symptoms. ACUTE POISONING. When wood alcohol is inhaled 
or swallowed, in toxic dose, it gives rise to abdominal cramps, nausea 
and vomiting, thirst, coryza, muscular prostration, chilliness, ver- 
tigo, headache, dilatation and immobility of the pupils with visual 
disorder and pronounced dyspnea, restlessness and insomnia. The 
blood serum is strongly toxic when injected into animals. These 
symptoms, it will be observed, closely resemble those caused by eating 
decomposed fish or animal foods. Prof. L. Pick, of Berlin, has found 
granular degeneration in the retinal ganglion cells, with swelling in 
the fibrils of the optic nerve. Apart from the ocular changes, no 
distinct pathological lesions are demonstrable. Wood alcohol, in 
distinction from grain alcohol, is more combustible in the body, being 
oxidized to formic acid. Ordinary alcohol, on the other hand, splits 
into the harmless products, water and carbon dioxid, unless it be 
taken in such excess as to prevent this change completely. Harnack 
believes that when methyl alcohol fails to poison, as in those who 
appear immune to its effects, it fails to be oxidized. The sub- 
stance then acts more as ordinary alcohol, producing drunkenness 
without specific poison. He regards the action upon the optic nerve 
as due to some localized peculiarity of oxidation. The blindness 
usually develops within from 12 to 24 hours after exposure to the 
fumes of wood alcohol, and in fatal cases death occurs within one 
or two days from apnea and cardiac paralysis. There may be cold 
sweats and delirium or coma. 



339 

Although the symptoms of wood alcohol poisoning are often slow 
in developing, sometimes requiring 24 to 36 hours, they become 
rapidly cumulative after the onset. 

The interiors of large brewery vats require varnishing. These 
vats are sometimes closed completely, except at a manhole at the 
bottom about 18 x 14 ins. in size, with a small opening for pipes in 
the top. Unskilled laborers are sometimes sent into the vats to 
apply the varnish, and, as the air at best is very confined, they are 
told to come out to breathe after 20 minutes of work. The varnish, 
moreover, is laid on with a broad whitewash brush, which, while it 
hastens the work, applies large quantities of varnish at a time. 
When this varnish is made with wood alcohol the fumes fill the vat 
in very concentrated form, and death may follow almost immedi- 
ately. In a brewery in New York City three deaths have occurred 
in this manner, and in one case the diagnosis of the physician called 
to the victim was "epilepsy." In another brewery in Buffalo one 
death took place from wood alcohol inhalation and a fellow work- 
man became permanently blind. The wood alcohol used is some- 
times disguised by being named "spirits" under various qualifying 
patent titles. Two men employed as varnishers died, in 1911, in 
New York City from wood alcohol poisoning. 

As small an internal dose as 10 drops has been known to cause 
serious visual disturbance. Dr. Hiram Woods, of Baltimore, re- 
ported, in June, 1913, a case of total permanent blindness of both 
eyes, due to inhalation of wood alcohol, with atrophy of the optic 
nerves and narrowing of the retinal vessels. The man was employed 
in a candy manufactory using a varnish for the candy, which proved 
to contain shellac dissolved in wood alcohol. Having acquired rheu- 
matic pains, he also rubbed the "spirits" for some time over his 
painful joints and muscles. 

A number of girls employed in a pencil factory suddenly suf- 
fered from visual disturbances and blindness caused by using a 
varnish made for the pencils which contained wood alcohol. A simi- 
lar form of varnish known as Mingpoo, used in the Philippines for 
varnishing ships because it withstands the salt air, has been known 
to cause death in coma (Dr. Victor G. Heiser). 



340 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Dr. W. B. Marple has reported to me the case of a child who, 
having fever and lying in a small room, was ordered alcohol sponge 
baths. The mother used wood alcohol and the child became blind. 

Although not an occupational example, as an illustration of the 
extreme toxicity of wood alcohol when swallowed may be cited the 
Berlin epidemic of poisoning which took place in the latter part of 
December, 1911, among occupants of a Municipal Night Lodging 
House to whom drink had been sold which was diluted with this 
cheap form of spirit. Eighty-nine died, among 163 who were made 
ill, and 5, who recovered, were made permanently blind. It was 
some time before the cause of the epidemic was discovered, the symp- 
toms being unfamiliar to many physicians and at first mistaken for 
ptomain or fish poisoning. 

Subsequently there were 7 more deaths from the same cause in 
another German town, Gelsenkirchen. 

In Hungary, in 1909, a liquor dealer who diluted his beverages 
with wood alcohol thus caused the death of 59 victims. A number 
of poison cases were reported at a Hungarian wedding in 1912, 
among those who drank liquor diluted. with methyl alcohol. Those 
who danced and thereby exercised and perspired most were least 
affected, and Foester (Munch, med. Woch., April 16, 1912), in 
commenting on this observation, says that hard labor and free per- 
spiration produce a relative immunity. 

Grosz reported, in 1909, a number of cases of methyl alcohol 
blindness seen at the Budapest eye clinic, which occurred among 
workmen who had inhaled the vapor. In 1904, 20 persons were 
killed or made blind by wood alcohol in Dorpat, Russia. 

When Ehrlich's salvarsan was used in Prague at first methyl 
alcohol was the solvent employed, but certain ill-effects led to its 
abandonment. 

Cases of fatal poisoning from drinking wood alcohol are reported 
quite often in the public press, and much more stringent legislation 
restricting the sale of this product is required. In 1912 about 50 
employees of a construction company in St. Lambert, Province of 
Quebec, indulged in a debauch in which they drank beverages diluted 
with this substance, as a result of which three of the men died. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 341 

In 1904 Drs. Frank Buller and Casey A. Wood reported from 
the literature to date 275 cases of death or blindness resulting from 
the internal or external use of wood alcohol, and Professor Charles 
Baskerville tells me that he has collected reports of upward of 1,000 
cases to the present date (1914). 

CHBONIC POISONING. Two cases of chronic methyl alcohol poi- 
soning in varnishers have been reported by S. E. Jelliffe, of Xew 
York. The men applied shellac dissolved in the alcohol and worked 
in small, ill-ventilated rooms. They both had hyperesthesia of the 
arms, with paresthesia of the forearms and dorsal surface of the 
hands. There was pain on pressure over the nerve trunks, and 
paroxysmal pains of great severity also occurred in the arms. There 
was also motor weakness of both arms. 

In chronic poisoning there may be conjunctivitis, epiphora, am- 
blyopia and continued photophobia, so that the victim is unable to 
tolerate artificial light and must usually give up his work. 

Prevention. Preventive measures should consist in the abandon- 
ment of the practice of using wood alcohol as a solvent of shellac 
for varnishing in confined spaces, and all containers of wood alcohol 
should be labeled conspicuously with a statement as to the extremely 
poisonous nature of the substance. Wherever it is used for any 
purpose the freest possible ventilation should be maintained. 

In Xew York City the Department of Health, in January, 
1912, prohibited the use of wood alcohol in any article of food or 
drink or medicinal remedy, and its use by barbers in hair tonics or 
face lotions. 

In Austria its use in all medicinal preparations, beverages and 
foods is now prohibited by law, and its sale and use in manufactures 
are also safeguarded. 

Treatment of Acute Poisoning. Artificial respiration should be 
maintained (See page 145) and cardiac stimulants should be given 
hypodermatically, such as 'strophanthin (0.25 mg.) or sodobenzoate 
of caffein. When possible transfusion may be employed after vene- 
section. For this purpose direct blood transfusion may be used, or, 
failing that, normal salt solution. Unfortunately, when a victim 
has inhaled enough of the vapor to be rendered unconscious, its 



342 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

toxic action is so prompt and powerful that even most energetic treat- 
ment usually fails to preserve the patient's life. 

METHYL BROMID AND IODID 

Methyl bromid is a colorless gas and the iodid a colorless fluid. 
Both are used in making anilin dyes. Inhaled in gaseous form, 
these substances give rise to headache, vertigo, diplopia and rigidity 
of the ocular muscles. There may be stupor. In more, severe cases 
the skin is pale, the eyes have a fixed stare, the pulse is weak, there 
is obstinate constipation with restlessness, and unconsciousness or 
semi-consciousness may last for -weeks. 

NITROBENZOL AND DINITROBENZOL 

NlTKOBENZOL, 

Nitrobenzol is derived through the action of a mixture of fuming 
nitric and sulphuric acids upon benzol, conducted by agitation in 
closed retorts. It is employed in the manufacture of high explo- 
sives such as roburite and in anilin production. It has an odor of 
bitter almonds and is used to a very limited extent in perfumery, 
soap, confectionery and cookery processes, in making dyes and in 
pharmaceutical laboratories. 

The vapor of nitrobenzol, on entering the lungs by inhalation, 
is absorbed and forms droplets in the circulation which act as em- 
boli. Nitrobenzol is most toxic when heated, but if cold it is also 
quite poisonous. 

Symptoms. ACUTE TYPE. The substance is exceedingly poi- 
sonous and clings to the hands or gloves, so that persons who shake 
hands with a workman who has recently handled it may acquire 
poisoning in this manner, as it may be absorbed through the skin, in 
which it causes burning sensations. It is also readily inhaled, when 
it gives rise to throbbing fullness of the head, dizziness, tinnitus, 
constipation, nausea and vomiting, respiratory oppression, dimin- 
ished blood pressure, and weakness. There is cyanosis of the face 
and lips and drowsiness, which may deepen into fatal coma. In 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 343 

the acute cases symptoms may develop immediately or be delayed for 
* an hour or two after exposure. In some cases, after improvement, 
a relapse takes place with fatal outcome. 

CHRONIC TYPE. In the chronic form, which may arise from 
saturation of the clothing with the vapor, there is marked cyanosis 
of the face, sometimes of the entire body, and a disagreeable prickling 
sensation in the tongue and pharynx. Anemia follows, with great 
lassitude. The blood shows deformed red cells and is brown and 
viscid. It gives the spectroscopic band of free hematin and a specific 
band, known as "Filehne's band," which lies between the red C and 
yellow D bands. The pulse is slow and tension is low, speech is 
hesitating, the gait is uncertain, the reflexes are intensified. Am- 
blyopia and optic neuritis are present. The skin has an icteroid 
hue. The victim may have an attack of coma lasting an hour or 
two. Tonic and clonic convulsions have been observed. The pupils 
are dilated and there may be nystagmus. The breathing becomes 
irregular and the breath has the odor of bitter almonds. Nausea is 
common, with vomiting. 

The course of the cases is variable. Workmen who have been 
employed with this substance for some time acquire a gradual tolera- 
tion for it, but become anemic and are dyspneic on exertion. Others 
are so sensitive to its fumes that they are unable to continue in the 
occupation of making it. 

Grandhomme has reported ("Die Fabriken") 60 cases of nitro- 
benzol poisoning, with 24 deaths. In only 5 of the cases, however, 
was the vapor inhaled. The other poisonings took place by mouth. 
R. Massini reported, in 1910, two cases, with recovery after serious 
symptoms, one having chronic poisoning and symptoms which lasted 
a month. 

Prevention. The workmen must be enjoined never to touch the 
compound with bare hands and to wash thoroughly and change the 
clothing before going home. Care must be taken to keep the shoes 
whole, as the substance may get upon the floor and be absorbed 
through the soles of the feet. It is important, also, not to use alco- 
holic drink while engaged in this employment. 

Treatment. There is no known antidote for nitrobenzol poison- 



344 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

ing. Artificial respiration should be maintained and hypodermo- 
clysis of normal salt solution should be given ; also high rectal injec- 
tions of hot solution of bicarbonate of sodium. Camphor, ether or 
other cardiac stimulants may be given hypodermatically. 



DINITROBENZOL 

Dinitrobenzol, which is used in making roburite, gives rise, when 
inhaled in powder or vapor, to amblyopia, scotoma, restriction of the 
visual field, venous hyperemia of the retinal vessels, and pallor of 
the papilla. The skin becomes brownish yellow and the sclera yel- 
low. Appetite fails and diarrhea is common. The liver is enlarged 
and tender. Headache and vertigo are complained of. The mucous 
membranes of the tongue, mouth and pharynx are stained yellow. 
The urine is yellow and may contain unaltered dinitrobenzol. The 
breath has an odor of bitter almonds. In general the condition re- 
sembles a severe catarrhal icterus. Ten fatal cases have been re- 
ported by Schroeder and Strassmann. 

PHOSGENE 

Phosgene or carbon oxychlorid is a colorless, suffocating gas used 
in the production of various organic compounds. When inhaled it 
gives rise to acute poisoning, which first is noticeable only after 
several hours. The gas decomposes in the lungs with formation of 
hydrochloric acid, causing dyspnea, cyanosis and pulmonary edema, 
usually fatal in result. 

PHOSPHORUS 

Phosphorus is prepared or used in the extraction of phosphorus 
from bone and mineral phosphate of lime, making phosphorus bronze, 
tar dyes, various chemical compounds and matches. When inhaled 
or introduced in any form into the mouth it is promptly absorbed 
by the blood and acts as a general systemic poison. 

White or yellow phosphorus was discovered by Brandt, of Ham- 
burg, in 1609, and red phosphorus was discovered 236 years later 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 345 

by Schroter, of Vienna. The former is volatile even at ordinary 
atmospheric temperature, and is highly inflammable and toxic. The 
latter is a crystalline powder which is not volatile and not very poi- 
sonous except in extremely large doses, whereas a single grain of 
white phosphorus may prove fatal if swallowed. The commercial 
phosphorus is made from bone ash with sulphuric acid. 

The discovery of the lucifer match is claimed by several coun- 
tries and appears to be of ancient date, but manufacture on a com- 
mercial scale was first employed in England by John Walker, in 
1827; in Austria by Sauria in 1831; and in the United States in 
1836. To France, however, belongs the credit of the invention, in 
1898, of the non-poisonous sesquisulphid match. In that country the 
manufacture of matches is a government monopoly. Formerly the 
profits of the industry were wiped out by damage claims for sickness 
and death caused by the poisonous phosphorus, so a profitable method 
of substituting the non-toxic sesquisulphid was devised by two Gov- 
ernment experts, Sevene and Cahen. 

There are three types of matches in use: (1) one in which the 
match is non-poisonous but ignites only on a prepared surface; 
(2) one in which a poisonous paste is employed, and which ignites 
when struck anywhere; (3) one which also ignites when struck any- 
where, but in which a non-poisonous paste is used. 

In making matches both red or amorphous and white or yellow 
phosphorus can be used, but the "safety" match, striking only on a 
prepared surface, is made without either, non-poisonous red phos- 
phorus being added only to the paste spread to make the striking 
surface on the side of the box. Antimony sulphid is another in- 
gredient of this paste, and the match heads contain potassium chlor- 
ate as an oxidizing agent. Safety matches were first made in Bo- 
hemia in 1854. 

The "strike anywhere," "Lucifer" or "parlor match" will ignite 
when applied to any rough surface with friction. It is made with a 
paste of poisonous white phosphorus, containing also glue, powdered 
glass, zinc oxid, potassium chlorate and some form of pigment. The 
proportion of phosphorus is 5 to 7 per cent. 

Formerly another type of match was made with sulphur instead 



346 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

of phosphorus, and sold in bunches of incompletely cut sticks, from 
which they could be torn off. The sulphur fumes were so disagree- 
able, however, that few of this cheap type of matches are made at 
present. 

The third type of match possesses both qualities of igniting when 
struck "anywhere," i. e., on any rough surface, and of being non- 
poisonous. This is made with the sesquisulphid. Sir Thomas 
Oliver quotes the formula for this paste, now universally used, as 
follows : 

PAETS 

Sesquisulphid of phosphorus 6 

Chlorate of potassium 24 

Oxid of zinc 6 

Red ocher 6 

Powdered glass 6 

Glue 18 

Water 34 

The method of making matches is described briefly as follows in 
the Report of the Illinois State Commission on Occupational Dis- 
eases, January, 1911 : "The automatic match machines consist, es- 
sentially, of a series of wheels over which a continuous belt travels 
(Fig. 48). This belt is made of about 800 plates joined together. 
Each plate has 600 perforations that is, twelve rows of 50 each. 
At one point in its transit each plate passes in front of a hopper, 
into which the trays of splints are emptied. An automatic punch 
strikes the splints, forcing them into the holes in the plate. This 
punch operates at the rate of 225 to 250 times per minute. As the 
belt moves, each plate, with its load of splints, passes over a vat of 
molten paraffin, into which the splints are dipped to a depth of 
about one-quarter of an inch. 

"A ljttle beyond the paraffin vat is the composition pot: This 
contains the material which forms the striking head of the match. 
The paraffined splints are coated at one end with this composition by 
means of slowly revolving rollers, which bring up an even amount 
of composition. For the ordinary parlor match one dipping is 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 



347 



sufficient. For the so-called double-tipped matches there is a second 
composition pot, with a different kind of material, into which the 
tip of the match is dipped." 




FIG. 48. POURING PHOSPHORUS COMPOSITION INTO THE TANKS IN WHICH 
THE MATCH STICKS DIP THEIR ENDS IN THEIR ONE HOUR'S TRAVEL 
AROUND THE MACHINE. Hazard: inhalation of phosphorus fumes. 

The match heads each take up a little of the paste. The matches 
are then set aside to dry in an air current, when they are punched out 
of the traveling belt, grouped by machinery and boxed, labeled and 
wrapped (Fig. 49). Much of the latter work is done by women 



348 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

and children. In all these processes, mixing, dipping, drying and 
packing, phosphorus fumes may be liberated in constant quantity, 
and the hands of the workpeople come into contact with the paste, 




FIG. 49. SORTING PHOSPHORUS MATCHES. Note the careless scattering of 
matches on the floor and the warning poster, "Employees Must Have Their 
Teeth Filled." Many young boys and girls work in this industry, inhaling 
phosphorus fumes. 

either moist or dry, which is thus readily conveyed to the mouth 
by the ringers, on food or the rim of an unclean drinking glass. 

The match sticks are made of white pine, poplar or basswood in 
this country, and the matches are packed in boxes made either of 
cardboard or a Russian aspen wood, which are constructed by ma- 
chinery. 

Oliver states: "On examining the hands of a boxer they are 
seen to be deeply stained by the dye given off by the heads of the 
matches, and they emit the characteristic garlicky odor. They glow 
in the dark. On analyzing the water in which 22 work people had 
washed their hands on leaving the factory, Thorpe found 37.3 milli- 
grams of phosphorus, an amount equal to 4.2 milligrams of phos- 
phorus per person for each ten hours' work." 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 349 

In Great Britain are 22 match factories employing about 3,000 
females and 1,000 males. 

In the United States are 16 factories, and the 15 studied by Dr. 
John B. Andrews, in 1909, employ approximately 3,591 workers, 
of whom 65 per cent., or considerably more than half, were exposed 
to the fumes of white phosphorus. The worst feature of the matter 




FIG. 50. BOXING PHOSPHORUS MATCHES BY CHILD LABOR. The swivel-hung 
windows are of good type for ventilation, but the electric lights are poorly 
hung and unshaded. Hazards: handling and inhalation of phosphorus. 

was the relatively great exposure of women and children under 15 
years of age, of whom respectively 95 and 83 per cent, were en- 
dangered (Fig. 50). Many of them were permitted to work without 
the slightest effort at protection or warning against the grave risks 
to health and life under which they labored. In 1909 there were 
121 boys and 193 girls, all under 16 years, employed in the match 
factories of the United States, considerably more than half of whom 
were under 14 years of age. 

In Austria 126 victims of phosphorus poisoning were treated in 
hospitals in a period of 10 years. 



350 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Dr. Andrews found records of 82 serious cases of phosphorus 
poisoning in 3 factories, 40 of which were in a single factory. In 
one factory 21 cases were recorded, 6 of them in 1909. In another 
factory, during a period of several years, 15 employees lost either 
one or both jaws from operations necessitated by the poisoning. One 
of these patients, a girl 22 years of age, died in a few months after 
being poisoned. The total cases of Dr. Andrews' investigation made 
in 1909 revealed 102 cases of serious poisoning, with 19 deaths, a 
frightful mortality. He submitted data to the Congressional Com- 
mittee investigating phosphorus poisoning of 14 deaths of children 
from 1 to 4 years of age, who, in playing about the floor or other- 
wise, had picked up and swallowed the heads of poisonous matches. 
One child, two years old, ate 60 such match heads and died in much 
agony. Death in such cases occurs usually within 24 to 48 hours. 
These matches have also been used for criminal and suicidal poi- 
soning. 

The first statutory prohibition of white phosphorus match manu- 
facture and importation was brought about in Finland, in 1872, 
and in Denmark, in 1874, with the effect of eradicating phosphorus 
match poisoning from both countries permanently. Other foreign 
countries, after first attempting control of the industry, were finally 
led to prohibit it: France, in 1897; Switzerland, in 1898; and the 
Netherlands, in 1901. In 1905 the International Association for 
Labor Legislation advocated a treaty proscribing the making and 
selling of the dangerous matches, the signers of which, in 1906, were 
France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands 
and Luxemburg. In 1908 Great Britain and, in 1909, Austria be- 
came signatories, and Canada, since 1910, has prohibited the manu- 
facture and importation of white phosphorus matches. 

As usual in matters concerning protective legislation against oc- 
cupational disease hazards, the United States was behind other civi- 
lized countries, and it was only through the persistent efforts of Dr. 
Andrews, acting for the American Association of Labor Legislation 
and the United States Bureau of Labor, that sufficient Congressmen 
were dissuaded from listening to the misstatements of self-interested 
and unhumanitarian manufacturers to follow the example of more 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 351 

progressive countries. The Diamond Match Company possessed a 
patent which would enable the red phosphorus to be used almost as 
cheaply as the white, which it offered to give up to the other com- 
panies if they would agree to abandon the white phosphorus process. 
Thus legislation was again delayed for a year. But, as they declined 
the offer, and as public sentiment was meanwhile clamoring for defi- 
nite action, it was at last secured. The Congressional bill which 
took effect July 1, 1912, taxes manufacturers of white phosphorus 
matches $1,000 per annum, but they may manufacture any other 
kind of match under a tax of only $50 per annum. Heavy penal- 
ties are attached for evasion of the tax, and, further, the white phos- 
phorus matches, if made, are taxed one cent per hundred, which is 
economically prohibitive. The importation of white phosphorus 
matches is absolutely prohibited. 

Andrews has computed that the cost to the average family by 
using the non-poisonous matches would mean an additional expen- 
diture of only 5 cents per year. 

The following abstract from the Berliner Jclinische Wochenshrift 
of May 16, 1910, was published in the Medical Record of June 
18, 1910: 

"HEMOLYTIC FREE FATTY ACIDS IN THE LIVER OF ACUTE 
YELLOW ATROPHY AND PHOSPHORUS POISONING. Joannovics and 
Pick have made a study of the extraction of hemolytic substances 
from the liver of a man who died of acute yellow atrophy, of a man 
who died of phosphorus poisoning, and of dogs and rabbits which 
were killed by phosphorus. They summarize their results as fol- 
lows: (1) Hemolysins of exceptional activity may be obtained from 
the liver in acute yellow atrophy and phosphorus poisoning in both 
man and animals. (2) These hemolytic substances are soluble in 
ethyl and methyl alcohol, ether, and acetone, and are made up almost 
entirely of fatty acids ; the lipoids insoluble in acetone are practically 
without hemolytic action. (3) In experimental phosphorus poison- 
ing this hemolysin is present in the blood in large quantities. (4) 
The subcutaneous fat in phosphorus poisoning does not contain this 
hemolytic substance. (5) The presence of such an intensely active 
hemolysin in the liver is valuable for the demonstration of free fatty 



352 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 




acids. (6) The fatty acids which come in consideration in hemolysis 
in organic extractions appear from the manner of their hemolytic 
action to belong to the higher unsaturated fatty acids. (7) In acute 
yellow atrophy and phosphorus poisoning it would appear that these 
unsaturated fatty acids, which normally are combined in lecithin, 
are set free by the destruction of the latter." 

Symptoms. The victim of chronic phosphorus poisoning becomes 
very anemic, loses appetite, acquires diarrhea and bronchitis, and 

becomes of an ashen, pal- 
lid hue, with progressive 
emaciation. Albuminuria 
may be present. Stoma- 
titis develops and becomes 
more and more serious. 
Ulcers form on the gums 
and buccal mucosa. The 
gums are swollen, spongy 
and easily bleed. The 
tongue is heavily coated 
and the breath is foul. 
The teeth are painful and 
discolored. They gradually loosen as the gums recede, and alveolar 
abscesses form. French authors refer to a condition of "phosphor- 
isure," consisting of pronounced anemia, albuminuria, bronchitis, 
gastric disorder, and an odor as of garlic in the breath. 

The specific action of phosphorus is finally manifested by a very 
painful subacute or chronic inflammation of the bones of the jaw, 
commencing usually at the roots of decayed teeth, and extending 
with periostitis and necrosis (Fig. 51) until a large-sized sequestrum 
is thrown off, with suppuration and sinuses which may open on the 
outer surface, forcing out stinking pus. The process may continue 
for months or several years unless treated. Meanwhile the constant 
secretion of pus gives rise to additional symptoms. It may be in- 
haled and cause bronchopneumonia, or, if swallowed, give rise to 
various digestive disorders. Necrosis of the upper jaw has been 
known to reach the base of the skull and induce a fatal septic menin-

chen Industrie," Verband der Fabrik-

gitis. In exceptional cases the 
long bones become brittle and 
easily fractured by slight mus- 
cular contraction. In one of 
Kocher's patients five such 
fractures were observed, and 
Dearden, of Manchester, re- 
ported two more cases of frac- 
tured femur. The necrosis in- 
variably begins at the site of a 
decayed tooth, and the lesion 
is probably due to the double 
irritation of the phosphorus 
dissolved in the saliva and 
bacterial infection of the de- 
cayed area, or, as Lewin sug- 
gests, there may be a primary 
septic gingivitis merely. 

Andrews refers to the case 
of an old woman who had for- 
merly lost her lower jaw from 
phosphorus necrosis twenty 
years previously, and who 
"masticated her food by press- 
ing it against her upper jaw 
with her thumb." 

The patient shown in Fig- 
ures 52 and 53 is a German, 
28 years of age, who worked 
in an Ohio match factory for 
15 months in 1907-8. As a 
result of white phosphorus 
poisoning he lost his teeth, ac- 
quired necrosis of the lower 
jaw, and required two opera- 
tions for its removal. He is

unable to eat solid food. He 
sued the match company for 
damages, but under the then 
existing laws was unable to 
secure any. Figures 54 and 
55 represent a similar case in 
a woman. 

Children who have swal- 
lowed poisonous phosphorus 
matches present acute fatty 
degeneration of the liver and 
kidneys and symptoms re- 
sembling those of .acute yellow 
atrophy of the liver, although 
they may die before there has 
been time for much jaundice 
to develop. 

Prognosis. The earlier 
symptoms of the disease yield 
readily to hygienic treatment 
on cessation of work, but after 
necrosis, with extensive sup- 
puration, has taken place it be- 
comes necessary to remove a 
considerable portion of the 
jaw, or sometimes take out 
most of both jaws, an opera- 
tion critical in itself, besides 
the danger of fatal sepsis or 
inhalation pneumonia. Other 
patients may die from inani- 
tion. Not a few have com- 
mitted suicide after realizing 
the hopelessness of their con- 
dition. 

In France, since the exclu- 



355 

sive use of the non-toxic sesquisulphid of phosphorus in the match 
industry, not a single case of phosphorus poisoning has been recorded, 
nor have any fires occurred in the factories. 

Prevention. Prevention consists in the absolute prohibition un- 
der strict penalty of the use of white phosphorus in the match indus- 
try. In any match factory, however, good ventilation should be 
insisted upon and the teeth, particularly, and general condition of 
the employees should be subject to frequent periodic medical ex- 
amination. 

Two or three of the English match companies issue the following 
rules to employees: 

THE PRESERVATION OF THE TEETH 

Without good teeth there cannot be thorough mastication. 

Without thorough mastication there cannot be perfect digestion, and 
poor health results. 

Hence the paramount importance of sound teeth. 

Clean teeth do not decay. 

Food left on the teeth ferments and the acid formed produces decay. 

Decay leads to pain and the total destruction of the tooth. 

When decay occurs, it should be attended to, whether giving pain or not. 

The immediate stopping of a small cavity is of the greatest service in 
preventing the necessity for extraction. 

The following rules should therefore be closely observed : 

1. The teeth should be cleansed at least once daily with toothbrush and 

powder. 

2. The best time to clean the teeth is after the last meal. 

3. A small toothbrush with stiff bristles should be used, brushing up and 

down and across, inside and outside, and in between the teeth. 

4. A simple tooth powder, or a little soap and some precipitated chalk, taken 

up on the brush should be used. If the teeth are dirty or stained, a 
little fine pumice powder may be used, but only occasionally. 

5. It is a good practice to rinse the mouth out after each meal. 

6. All rough usage of the teeth, such as cracking nuts, biting thread, etc., 

should be avoided; but the proper use of the teeth in chewing is good 
for them. 

7. All persons engaged in these works should rinse their mouths thoroughly 

before meals and before leaving the works. 

Castile soap is cheap and makes a good suds, which should be 
squirted around in the mouth by moving the cheeks. Borax and 



356 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

potassium permanganate solutions may also be used for rinsing the 
mouth. Foods, especially milk, butter and meat, readily absorb 
phosphorus fumes and should on no account be -left in the workroom. 

In Hungary cloths saturated with turpentine are hung in the 
workrooms where phosphorus is used to absorb its fumes, and tur- 
pentine (5 per cent.) is added to the phosphorus paste. 

The treatment of the bone necrosis and abscess is purely surgical. 



PHOSPHORETTED HYDROGEN AND FERROSILICON 

PlIOSPHOKETTED HYDROGEN 

This is a colorless, nauseous gas liberated in the process of phos- 
phorus extraction and in making the sesquichlorid of phosphorus for 
match manufacture. It also is derived during the making of acety- 
lene from calcium carbid and phosphate, and from ferrosilicon. 
When inhaled the gas causes oppression and burning pains in the 
thorax, with headache, vertigo, tinnitus aurium, weakness, and in- 
tense thirst. It disintegrates the blood, and may thus prove fatal. 

FERROSILICON 

Ferrosilicon poisoning is one of the newest of occupational haz- 
ards, incident to modern chemical processes designed to improve 
products of the steel industry. The substance is composed of a mix- 
ture of products of both iron and silica, the latter being in pro- 
portion of 30 to 70 per cent. It is used in making electrodes and 
is added in iron and steel foundries to the molten metal to remove 
bubbles of gas. The high-percentage ferrosilicon is prepared by fus- 
ing a mixture of sand or quartz, which furnishes the silica, with iron 
or steel turnings and coal or coke in an electric furnace heated to 
2,000 C. The impurities, calcium phosphate and arsenic, are not 
removed, but are fused with the carbon of the. coke to calcium 
phosphid and arsenic. If water gains accidental access to these two 
latter substances, decomposition results, with evolution of phosphor- 
etted and arseniuretted hydrogen gas. These gases are immediately 
fatal to animals if present in the atmosphere in only one-fourth of 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 357 

one per cent. Spontaneous decomposition may also occur in the 
high per cent, grades of ferrosilicon, but percentages of 30 or less 
are comparatively safe to handle. 

Symptoms. Symptoms of the poisoning appear to be due to the 
inhalation of phosphoretted hydrogen mainly, as it exists in greater 
proportion than the arseniuretted hydrogen, although the effect of the 
two gases is similar. These symptoms are violent, as the gas is a 
powerful hemolytic, and death may take place within a few hours. 
They are chiefly gastric and circulatory and consist of nausea and 
vomiting, with violent abdominal cramps, followed by immediate col- 
lapse, the great weakness being followed by gradual onset of coma 
and death. The violence of the poison, with the nature of the symp- 
toms and sudden collapse, has sometimes given rise to a suspicion of 
the presence of cholera, which, however, may easily be corrected by 
bacterial examination of the stools. 

It is upon steamers in the holds of which ferrosilicon is carried 
that wholesale poisoning is liable to occur if bilge water gains access 
to the containers of the substance. 

The first recorded case of poisoning was observed in 1904, and 
shortly after 50 steerage passengers of the steamer Vaderland were 
made violently ill by the gases, 11 of whom died. On another 
steamer, Ashton, making a short voyage of a day, 5 steerage pas- 
sengers were fatally poisoned. A number of other fatal cases were 
brought to light by a British Parliamentary investigation, but in the 
United States no authentic cases of fatal poisoning have been re- 
ported, although the product is manufactured here in considerable 
quantity, especially at Niagara. 

Prevention and Treatment. To avoid the great hazard of ferro- 
silicon poisoning when the high-grade product is dealt with, it 
should be broken into bits and well aired before shipping, and should 
be protected from water when stored in the holds of vessels or else- 
where, and surrounded by open spaces. It should never be stored near 
apartments occupied by man or carried on passenger vessels. The 
poisonous gases act so quickly and violently when liberated that treat- 
ment must be energetic and prompt by means of hypodermatic heart 
stimulants, artificial respiration, and perhaps transfusion of blood. 



358 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

SMOKE 

This is an indefinite term usually referring to the products of 
imperfect combustion of wood or coal, but used also to describe un- 
consumed products of the burning of oil, kerosene and a great variety 
of chemicals. Ordinary wood or coal smoke contains soot and gases 
such as carbon dioxid and monoxid, sulphurous vapors, etc. It may 
be inhaled either hot or cold. It irritates the eyes, causing lacrima- 
tion and conjunctivitis. It gives rise to cough and rhinitis, laryn- 
gitis and bronchitis, according to its density and composition. Its 
effects are fully described under the headings of its several com- 
pounds, such as Carbon Monoxid and Dioxid. (See, also, Firemen 
and Air Impurities.) 

SULPHUR AND SULPHUROUS ACID 

SULPHUR 

The principal sulphur mines are found in Sicily among the vol- 
canic products of the island. The miners are subjected to the in- 
halation of much irritant dust, and catarrh of the upper air passages 
is common among them. (Fig. 56.) 

In the sulphur mines of Sicily about 40,000 workmen are em- 
ployed. Sir Thomas Oliver (Brit. Med. Jour., July 1, 1911) found 
that the men are sometimes asphyxiated by inhalation of sulphuret- 
ted hydrogen and carbon dioxid gases derived from bituminous clay 
in the mines and from the lights used in the mines. Sulphurous 
acid and sulphuretted hydrogen also give rise to conjunctivitis. 

Workmen employed in the grinding of pure sulphur and in its 
distillation from pyrites are subject to sulphur poisoning. The lat- 
ter substance usually also contains arsenic, which is a further source 
of possible poisoning. In sulphur-refining processes more or less 
vapor escapes from the retorts and condensation chambers, especially 
when they require to be opened or cleaned. 

Sulphur, both in powdered form and as a paste, is much used 
on plants as an insecticide. Sulphur vapor is highly irritating and 
destructive of the lower forms of life. The vapor is liberated in 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES

smelting and illuminating gas plants, match factories, the manufac- 
ture of sulphuric acid and in bleaching various products such as 
straw hats, cotton cloth, etc. It is also used in preparing hops and

dried fruit, and it formerly was much in vogue in the form of 
"candles" for fumigation after infectious diseases, but is of doubtful 
efficacy. Lehmann found sulphur to be irritant in strength of 0.04 
part per 1,000 of air. 

SULPHUROUS ACED 

This acid is evolved from the roasting of sulphur ores, and is 
used in making sulphuric acid, in candle, glue and brick works, as 
well as a bleaching agent. Among the numerous processes for which 
it is employed are the bleaching and disinfection of such animal tis- 



360 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

sues as wool, hair, bristles, feathers, down, catgut, and gelatin, the 
refining of certain metals, vulcanizing of rubber, making ultrama- 
rine, flint glass and sodium sulphate. 

Sulphurous acid may be inhaled up to a strength of 7 per cent, 
without serious effect, other than that of producing digestive dis- 
orders (Hirt), but if it be much stronger it irritates the pulmonary 
branches of the vagus, finally paralyzing the respiratory center. 
After death the lungs are found dry and contracted. According to 
Ogata, sulphurous acid may be transformed in the body into sul- 
phuric acid, at the expense of the oxygen of the hemoglobin. When 
concentrated, the fumes are so irritating to the throat that the victim 
feels compelled immediately to seek the open air, hence cases of seri- 
ous or fatal poisoning by inhalation of the fumes of the acid rarely 
occur. The conjunctivas are inflamed, the tears are increased, there 
is a sensation of strangulation in the throat and intense dyspnea 
results, with violent coughing. In extreme cases death may result 
from respiratory spasm and asphyxia. Ordinarily, however, work- 
men who are exposed for some time to mild degrees of sulphur poi- 
soning complain 'of headache, anorexia, spasmodic cough, sneezing, 
hemoptysis, bronchitis, constriction of the chest, gastro-intestinal 
disorders and conjunctivitis, with smarting of the eyes and lacrima- 
tion. Anemia, too, is common. There is more or less gastric disorder 
with pain. For these symptoms the workmen soon acquire tolera- 
tion, but if they resume work and are again exposed to the fumes 
after a few weeks' interval, the symptoms recur. When inhaled in 
larger quantities the mucous membranes become ulcerated. 

Treatment. Preventive treatment comprises proper ventila- 
tion. Anodyne cough mixtures may be required, but a few days 
of rest and careful dieting will usually relieve the digestive symp- 
toms. The eyes should be bathed with a saturated solution of boric 
acid in distilled water. 

SULPHUR CHLORID 

This is a thick, brownish, fuming nauseous fluid used mainly in 
the rubber industry and to dissolve fats and sulphur. When inhaled 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 361 

as a vapor it gives rise to nausea and vomiting, and in contact with 
the water contained in mucus may form hydrochloric acid, giving 
rise to marked irritation of the respiratory passages. 



SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN 

Sources of the Poison. This gas, like carbonic acid gas, exists 
both as a natural and artificial product and under very similar cir- 
cumstances. As a natural product it is prevalent in subterranean 
passages such as deep mines, tunnels under rivers, in blocked 
sewers, and especially where there is decomposing organic material 
in privies, marsh mud, manure beds, etc. Many of the sulphurous 
mineral waters evolve it in considerable quantity, and it has more 
than once proved fatal to those employed in piping or bottling them. 
Men occupied in cleaning out cesspools may be overcome by the gas, 
and it has been known to accumulate in old casks on shipboard in 
which there were materials of decomposition. In the bronzing of 
metals a sulphid of arsenic is used, and sulphuretted hydrogen 
(H 2 S) may be formed in the process, as it is in the manufacture of 
sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ). In soap factories and tanneries calcium 
sulphid and sulphuric acid are used, and by chemical reactions sul- 
phuretted hydrogen may be formed. In its natural origin sul- 
phuretted hydrogen is often associated with CO 2 , carburetted hydro- 
gen, carbon bisulphid, marsh gas (CH 4 ), ammonia and ammonium 
compounds, all of which are more or less toxic. In Paris about 
1,000 men are employed in the large sewers, where they are exposed 
to these various gases and not infrequently are overcome by inhaling 
them. Plumbers and telephone or telegraph layers who are called 
upon to work in trenches may be exposed to sulphuretted hydrogen 
gas. The gas may be evolved in a decomposition reaction of Prus- 
sian blue or potassium ferrocyanid with sulphate of iron. It is 
given off in the refineries where certain animal products are made. 
In metallurgy it is formed by action of acids on pyrites. According 
to Brouardel and Loye, a percentage of 0.12 of the gas may prove 
fatal in the air breathed. It is present in gas liquor storage tanks, 
gas purifiers and sulphate stills. 



362 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Pathology. The gas when inhaled is absorbed by the bloodves- 
sels of the respiratory tract and promptly reduces the hemoglobin 
of the blood. It paralyzes respiration at the bulbar center, and pro- 
duces death from asphyxia. The gas may enter in smaller quantity 
through the mouth and digestive tract, and it is a fairly constant 
product of intestinal decomposition and fermentation, especially 
after sulphur-containing foods have been eaten. It may be absorbed 
from the alimentary canal and given off by the lungs. Many years 
ago an ingenious but fallacious treatment for pulmonary tubercu- 
losis was suggested. A small quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen gas 
was introduced through a tube into the rectum. The gas is inimical 
to the tuberculosis bacillus, and it was held that, on being absorbed 
by the hemorrhoidal veins, it would be borne in the circulation to the 
lungs and there destroy the bacilli. In experiments which I made 
I was able to detect a strong odor of sulphuretted hydrogen in the 
exhaled air of patients within 2 or 3 minutes after the gas was 
injected into the rectum. It is manifestly impossible to inject the 
gas in sufficient strength to affect tuberculosis bacilli without en- 
tirely decomposing the blood in the process ! 

Symptoms. ACUTE OR FULMINATING FORM. In acute poison- 
ing, which is uncommon, there is immediate general muscular paraly- 
sis, with loss of consciousness and convulsions. Respiration becomes 
feeble and irregular, there are deep cyanosis and a feeble, quick pulse, 
and the victim dies from apnea, or, if the dose be not fatal, he may 
be revived by artificial respiration after some hours of unconscious- 
ness. In some cases the fatal symptoms do not develop immediately 
on inhaling the gas, but after an interval of perhaps half an hour. 
In such cases death from asphyxia may take place more slowly, 
with preceding dyspnea, irregular heart action, insensitive corneae, 
dilated pupils, with absent pupillary reflexes, contractures of the 
extremities, a low blood pressure, cyanosis, sugar or albumin in the 
urine, and finally insensibility, which gradually deepens into pro- 
found coma. 

CHRONIC POISONING. Chronic poisoning, or at least a slow type 
of poisoning, is met with in which the symptoms are: malaise, 
vomiting, fulness in the head and a sensation of weight in the stom- 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES 363 

ach. The latter symptoms the sewer men call "the lead." Anemia 
follows and the patient becomes weak and cachectic. 

Sulphuretted hydrogen blackens silver with a deposit of lead 
sulphid, hence silver coins in the pockets of workmen exposed to this 
gas promptly become tarnished. 

Prevention. Before entering a sewer or trench where the gas 
may be present it is desirable for the workman to tie a rope to his 
waist so that he may be hauled out promptly if overcome. A lighted 
candle may be lowered first to test the quality of the air, or, as is 
done in Germany, a pigeon may be let down in a cage. When real 
danger is known to exist the workman should be provided with an 
oxygen helmet (See page 146). 

Treatment. Means of resuscitation should be always at hand, 
consisting of a can of oxygen gas for inhalation and hypodermatic 
stimulants (See page 144). Artificial respiration should be per- 
formed (See page 145) where any signs of failing respiration exist. 
As the action of the gas is hemolytic, as in illuminating gas poison- 
ing, bleeding followed by saline infusion or direct blood transfusion 
should be resorted to. 

TRINITROPHENOL 

Trinitrophenol manufacture gives rise to much illness. Accord- 
ing to Leymann's statistics for each 100 workmen, there are 128 
cases of illness per annum in this industry. The symptoms are 
those of respiratory irritation, cardiac depression and gastric dis- 
order. 

TURPENTINE 

Turpentine has many important uses. The vapor is evolved in 
the distillation of turpentine, in calico printing and wherever it is 
employed as a solvent or diluent, as in dissolving varnishing ma- 
terials, diluting mineral paints, etc., and as a drier or oxidizer of 
paints and varnishes. Where the paint or varnish is spread over 
large surfaces in the confined air of workshops where carriages, 
wagons or automobiles are varnished, or in the closed rooms of 
freshly painted houses, the percentage of the vapor in the atmos- 



364 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

phere becomes considerable. One of my patients had been a fur- 
niture polisher for many years, suffering very much from chronic 
bronchitis and chronic conjunctivitis. 

Turpentine is especially used in painting on porcelain and on 
glass. It is also used by dyers of lace and of other fabrics, as a 
polish for furniture and wood flooring, and as a solvent in the manu- 
facture of rubber articles. Cooking and other domestic utensils of 
iron ware are often shellacked and dried in ovens. In the process 
rosin and turpentine fumes are evolved and may prove quite irritat- 
ing to the respiratory system. In Hamburg, to which port much 
turpentine is shipped, the navvies who unload it are sometimes poi- 
soned by it. 

Those who work in the industries above mentioned nearly always 
suffer sooner or later from the effect of the fumes. So do those 
who sleep in freshly painted rooms with poor ventilation. -Many 
workmen acquire a considerable degree of tolerance for the fumes, 
but novices are promptly affected. 

When derived from admixture with lead paint turpentine fumes 
alone do not explain the violent retching and vomiting, colic and 
other symptoms which sometimes ensue, for zinc paint with turpen- 
tine does not cause such disturbance, and painters may be made ill 
by using certain oils to mix with paint, whereas others do not affect 
them. Oliver believes that between a tere^inthinated oil and white 
lead there is apparently some compound formed which in its nascent 
state is harmful to those who breathe it. 

Turpentine vapor, when inhaled experimentally by animals, 
causes tremors, an uncertain spasmodic gait, paralysis of the hind 
legs, convulsions and a rapid, feeble pulse. Turpentine is a direct 
irritant to the skin and mucous membranes. As proof of the latter 
is its well-known effect in stimulating peristalsis when added to ene- 
mata, and in proof of the former are the superficial redness of the 
skin produced by turpentine stupes and the mild dermatitis which 
may be excited by turpentine ointments. When inhaled the vapor 
is absorbed by the blood, and the turpentine is subsequently elimi- 
nated in somewhat altered form by the kidneys, imparting an odor of 
violets to the urine.

Symptoms. The symptoms of turpentine poisoning affect the. 
eyes, skin, stomach and intestines, pulmonary, urinary, circulatory 
and nervous systems. Females are more susceptible than males to 
the nervous symptoms. Alcoholic subjects are easily affected by tur- 
pentine fumes. 

EYES. Turpentine spattered into the eyes causes acute pain. 
The vapor also irritates the eyes severely. They present conjunc- 
tival congestion and acute or chronic inflammation, with redness 
and more or less swelling of the lids accompanied by visual dis- 
order. 

SKIN. The skin may present erythema, congestion and acute or 
chronic dermatitis. To the latter ailment painters are very subject. 
Much impure turpentine is applied by hand for polishing and clean- 
ing painted woodwork, floors, furniture, etc. It irritates the un- 
protected hands, giving rise to hardening of the epidermis and 
chronic eczema of very intractable type. The thickened epidermis 
is liable to present deep fissures which bleed easily and cause con- 
siderable discomfort and pain. 

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. Nausea and vomiting are usual symptoms 
in acute poisoning, and diarrhea may result from increased peristal- 
sis. In medicinal doses turpentine aids in expelling flatus and is 
mildly antiseptic, or rather antifermentative. It formerly had 
some reputation as an agent for controlling hemorrhage in typhoid 
fever, when given in capsules or emulsion in 5 or 10 minim 
doses. 

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. The immediate result of inhaling strong 
fumes of turpentine is laryngeal spasm, followed by an irritant dry 
cough and hoarseness. Rhinitis may be present. As an after-re- 
sult bronchitis occurs, which, if the irritation be long continued, 
may become chronic, with muco-purulent expectoration. ' In this 
connection it is interesting to note that turpentine medicinally in- 
haled, as with steam from a croup kettle, is an excellent deodorant 
in cases of fetid bronchitis, foul bronchiectatic cavities, and for ab- 
scess and gangrene of the lung. I know of none better. It also, 
like the balsams, acts favorably upon chronic bronchial catarrh. 
Turpentine thus affords another of the many illustrations of bene- 



366 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

fit in medicinal doses to some of the very ailments which may be 
produced by toxic doses. 

URINARY SYSTEM. Turpentine, being, as stated above, elimi- 
nated by the kidneys after poisonous doses of its fumes have been 
inhaled, irritates them severely, causing acute hyperemia and some- 
times acute nephritis. Pains in the back are complained of, with 
frequent voiding of small quantities of urine and strangury. The 
urine is often bloody and may contain granular and blood casts, 
epithelial casts, and albumin. The urinary symptoms may appear 
a day or two after an initial attack characterized by vomiting, drowsi- 
ness and headache. In a study of 62 turpentine workers by Nicholl, 
Flinn and Hayhurst it was found that 14 had organic renal dis- 
ease. 

CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. The circulatory system is affected by 
continued turpentine inhalations. The patient complains chiefly of 
headache, tinnitus aurium and vertigo (with sometimes loss of equi- 
librium), and a quickened pulse. Anemia is usually present. 

NERVOUS SYSTEM. The patient becomes irritable and depressed, 
like many subjects of chronic alcoholism. In chronic turpentine 
poisoning, as seen among calico printers, there is emaciation with 
anemia and gastro-intestinal disorder. 

Prevention. Turpentine should be handled with care, trans- 
ported only in metal containers to prevent the hazard of breakage, 
and they should be opened only under conditions of good ventilation. 
In painting or varnishing indoors good ventilation is of great im- 
portance, and one should not sleep in a freshly painted room until 
the paint is thoroughly dry and the room has been well aired for a 
day or two. 

Treatment. In mild acute cases the symptoms soon pass off in 
the fresh air, without treatment. In more severe cases the renal 
symptoms demand attention. The patient should be given a milk 
diet and drink abundantly of water. Cupping and poulticing over 
the lumbar region may be resorted to. The nausea may be relieved 
by bicarbonate of soda or lime water, and the cough is best treated 
by codein and a simple cough mixture such as ammonium chlorid in 
syrup of prunus Virginiana.

MINERAL AND OTHER ACID POISONING 

General Symptoms. PULMONARY EDEMA. The effect of inhala- 
tion of mineral acid fumes by man varies naturally with the dura- 
tion of the inhalation and density of the fumes. Concentrated fumes 
may cause immediate death from suffocation. Less concentrated 
fumes or inhalations of very brief duration cause irritant cough, a 
sensation of choking, increased bronchial secretion, turgescence of 
the veins, and lowering of the blood pressure. The coagulation time 
of the blood is somewhat lengthened. After a few hours pulmonary 
edema may develop. If the edema be slight, the patient may ap- 
parently recover, but in. two or three days may develop lobar pneu- 
monia, which is liable to prove fatal. 

The acute edema of the lungs caused so constantly by the in- 
halation of strong fumes of mineral acids has been made the sub- 
ject of an interesting experimental study by a former pupil of 
mine, Dr. W. G. Hudson, now connected with the largest manu- 
factory of high explosives in the country. The experiments were con- 
ducted by subjecting rabbits and dogs to the acid fumes in order to 
determine whether the resulting edema was secondary to hemolytic 
changes or to a primary corrosive action upon the lung tissue. The 
blood was but slightly altered. There was, within a few hours after 
exposure to the fumes of three minutes' duration, a diminution in 
red cells of 200,000 or 300,000 and an increase in leukocytes of 
2,000 to 4,000. Coagulation time was not appreciably altered in 
several cases, but in others it was slightly lengthened. The alkalinity 
of the blood was slightly reduced, probably from the acid absorbed. 
Further experiments were made in dogs by tracheotomizing them, 
tying off one lung during the inhalation of the fumes and then con- 
tinuing artificial respiration until the animal died, both lungs being 
inflated. Autopsy showed that the lung into which the fumes had 
been prevented from entering remained normal, whereas the acidified 
lung was markedly edematous. Hence Hudson concludes : 



368 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



"While some of the acid principles are absorbed into the blood 
in cases of acid fume poisoning, as shown by the various blood tests 
throughout these experiments, the serious secondary symptoms are 
due to the direct chemical action of the fumes upon the delicate 
tissues lining the air vesicles, and not to changes brought about by 
absorption into the blood. 

"The usual secondary 
symptoms which have been 
so fatal are the result of a 
pulmonary edema which 
the acid fumes excite. This 
edema shows no patholog- 
ical difference from that 
met with in general medi- 
cal practice, although it 




occupies a rather unique 
position in being a simple, 
uncomplicated edema, 
while that met with in 



FIG. 57. EROSION OF THE TEETH DUE TO 
Two YEARS' WORK IN THE FUMES OF 
HYDROCHLORIC ACID. (From "Gefahr- 
en der Arbeit in der chemischen Indus- 
trie," Verband der Fabrikarbeiter 
Deutschlands, Hanover, 1911.) 

medical practice is always secondary to some other disease. 

"But the experiments show in addition that when the exposure 
has not been sufficient to cause pulmonary edema it may easily be 
sufficient to be the exciting cause of a lobar pneumonia." 

The experiments also showed marked diminution in blood press- 
ure, and when large doses were administered the animals died in 
convulsions, frothing at the mouth. (See also Edema of the Lungs, 
page 154.) 

The dipping of metals such as bronze, brass and copper into 
mineral acids to burnish their surface is a hazardous industry. For 
this purpose sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids are used singly 
or in combination. These acids, especially nitric acid, through their 
fumes attack the respiratory passages and cause decay of the teeth. 
(Fig. 57.) The fumes are all heavier than air and should be re- 
moved by exhaust ducts placed immediately over their source, as 
well as near or under the flooring, which should be of asphalt with 
tile drainage. 



TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 369 

The ill effects of acid fumes are by no means confined to the 
immediate surroundings of the workman. In the vicinity of chemi- 
cal works, where large quantities of acid fumes are discharged into 
the surrounding atmosphere, vegetation is destroyed and animal life 
may suffer. The American Game Protective and Propagation As- 
sociation has estimated that in Utah, in the vicinity of Salt Lake 
City, as many as 2,000,000 water fowl are annually destroyed by 
the acids discharged into marshes from manufacturing plants. 

Treatment. To prevent the local irritation of the mineral acid 
fumes the nostrils should be kept greased with vaselin. The best 
possible ventilation should be secured, for the wearing of respirators 
is of little value. 

Conjunctivitis may be relieved by hot compresses and warm 
saturated boric acid solution. The bronchitis is best treated by rest 
in bed in a room in which the air may be kept constantly moist by 
means of a croup kettle in which plain water and lime water 
may be evaporated. If there is much constriction of the chest, a 
hot flaxseed poultice may be applied or a large weak mustard paste 
(1-8). Distressful cough may be relieved by codein or heroin, and 
laxatives should be given. If there is any tendency to edema of the 
glottis it may be relieved by a spray of adrenalin chlorid. 

CARBOLIC ACID 

Poisoning by fumes of this substance is uncommon. When it is 
observed there are frequent vomiting', salivation and difficulty in 
swallowing. Chronic nephritis may develop and the urine becomes 
of a smoky gray color. Emaciation ensues, known as "carbolic 
marasmus." 

The symptoms in general resemble those of dinitrobenzol poison- 
ing, described on page 344. 

The eczema produced by handling carbolic acid is described 
under Eczema. 

HYDROCHLORIC ACID 

Occupations. The vapor of this acid may be liberated during its 
manufacture, in the process of manufacturing chlorin or the alkaline 



370 DISEASES DUE TO IKRITANT SUBSTANCES 

chlorids, galvanization of sheet iron, the bleaching of jute, hemp, 
flax and linen cloth, for which latter a bath of chlorid of lime and 
sulphuric acid is employed. The acid is also used in wire works 
and in the glazing of pottery, in enameling and soldering, and refin- 
ing and bleaching tallow. 

In general, hydrochloric acid fumes are less irritating to the 
respiratory passages than pure chlorin gas, and among workmen the 
ill effects are less severe than those of the other mineral acids, al- 
though brief exposure to an atmosphere containing 0.1 per cent, 
has been known to cause death. Lehmann (Arch, fur Hygiene, v, 1) 
found that less than one-thousandth part of this gas per volume of 
air may give rise to serious symptoms. 

Symptoms. Hydrochloric acid fumes give rise to conjunctivitis, 
rhinitis and bronchitis. They produce irritant dry cough and sensa- 
tions of burning and choking. Nosebleed may occur. If concen- 
trated they may cause pneumonia, or prompt death from dyspnea, 
hemoptysis and stupor. When inhaled for long periods in dilute 
form they erode the teeth by solution of their lime salts and cause 
ulcers of the nasal cavities, tongue, mouth or pharynx, gastro-intes- 
tinal disorder, anemia and emaciation. Such chronic cases are most 
often found among makers of synthetic soda. In this occupation 
they are likewise exposed to fumes of sulphuric acid. 

In chronic cases of hydrochloric acid poisoning Fornwood and 
Kobert have reported perforation of the nasal septum, as in chrome 
poisoning, and necrosis of the alse nasi. Both anosmia and hyperos- 
mia are observed. 

HYDROFLUORIC ACID 

This acid is derived from distillation of sulphuric acid and cal- 
cium fluorid. The fumes are exceedingly poisonous. They may 
affect workmen employed in etching upon glass (of which the acid is 
a solvent), in porcelain painting, and various bleaching processes, 
as in whitening cane and bleaching tallow. The acid is used also in 
cleaning glass, in making glass labels and signs, and by dentists to 
roughen the adherent surface of porcelain inlays. In making min- 
eral phosphates or superphosphate for fertilizers the chlorin and 



TOXIC FLUIDS: ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 371 

fluorin compounds associated with these phosphates, when treated 
with sulphuric acid, may be set free in the form of hydrochloric and 
hydrofluoric acids. 

Two deaths among chemists are recorded from inhalation of this 
acid, and a number of cases of both acute and chronic poisoning by 
it have been observed, several of which were fatal. 

In an autopsy reported by the Illinois State Commission on Occu- 
pational Diseases, made upon a victim of chronic hydrofluoric acid 
poisoning the lungs showed extensive cicatrization of old ulcers and 
fresh ulcers and abscesses at the bifurcation of the bronchi. 

Symptoms.- Hydrofluoric acid fumes are especially irritating to 
the eyes, and may also irritate the respiratory system, causing, after 
long-continued inhalation in small quantity, deep ulceration of the 
nose with fibrous margins of the ulcers. Marked anemia is also 
present. The victims of inhalation of the fumes acquire coryza, 
conjunctivitis with greatly swollen eyelids, and sometimes ophthalmia 
with ulcerative keratitis. There are also rhinitis, pharyngitis, ulcers 
in the mouth, and bronchitis, with a choking sensation. Broncho- 
pneumonia may develop, and pulmonary fibrosis occurs. The local 
reaction is so strong that periostitis may follow superficial applica- 
tion of the acid to the skin, and the cutaneous ulcers which form 
with blebs are deep, painful and extremely slow in healing, even 
when very limited in extent. 

Dr. Laura H. Branson has reported the case of an instructor in 
chemistry in the Iowa State University who, while etching glass with 
the acid, injured his hand and got some of the acid into the cut 
surface of his fingers. Excruciating local pain was followed by 
edema, stiffening of the fingers, and constitutional reaction consisting 
of extreme nervousness and a rise of body temperature to 105 F. 
Local periostitis and synovitis followed, and resolution was not com- 
plete in less than eight weeks, although not more than 3 minims of 
the acid had originally been in contact with the skin. 

A lad of 14 years came to my clinic who was employed cleaning 
stained glass with a mineral acid, the exact nature of which was not 
known to him, but it was probably hydrofluoric. In his work he in- 
haled acid fumes, and after two weeks of this employment he began 



372 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

to vomit daily after meals. He had nausea, vertigo and diarrhea. 
He had previously been well, and on Sundays, when he did not work, 
he always felt better. The boy stated that a number of others who 
worked with him were similarly affected. 

Prevention. To protect the eyes, celluloid goggles should be worn 
and gloves to protect the hands. Respirators, too, should be worn 
and a good exhaust with blow-fan driving a strong current of air 
away from the workman is absolutely essential. 

NITRIC AND NITROUS ACIDS, NITROUS GASES 

Nitric acid is formed by subjecting Chile saltpeter to the action 
of sulphuric acid. Nitrous gases are formed by low degrees of 
nitrogen oxidation, such as NO, NO 2 N 2 O 3 , N 2 O 4 and HNO 2 . 
They are produced by the deoxidizing action of nitric acid on a 
variety of substances, like metals, wool, wood, paper, straw, and 
textile substances. They are formed in the preparation of nitric 
acid and its salts, in metal etctyng and electro-metallurgy, in the 
making of explosives, in celluloid works, in making anilins, picric 
acid, and hat making, dyeing and calico printing, and a great num- 
ber of other common industries. Nitric acid on exposure to the air in 
the presence of metals as well as organic matter is decomposed and 
volatilized with formation of oxids, particularly the nascent peroxid, 
N 2 O 4 , known as nitrogen tetroxid or dinitryl, which is excessively 
poisonous when inhaled, giving rise to acute pneumonia, with much 
swelling of the bronchial mucosa and suffocation. The fumes of 
nitrous and nitric acids, nitro-hydrochloric acid and nitrogen binoxid 
arise from the processes of manufacture of a variety of products and 
are highly irritating to the respiratory system. Thus they may be 
developed in the making of arsenic acid, arsenate of sodium, the 
boiling of benzin in nitric acid to form nitrobenzin, and the 
preparation of sulphuric, oxalic and picric acids. Ammonium ni- 
trate is developed in sugar refineries in the maceration of beets. 
False pearls are plunged into nitric acid to dissolve the central stem 
of copper on which they are held. In the making of cheap jewelry 
nitric acid is used to give to copper the appearance of gold. Nitric 



TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 373 

acid is also used in assaying, as in testing coins, in the making of 
felt hats to form a nitrate of mercury {See page 291), and in certain 
metallic blackening and coloring processes in which sulphate of iron 
is mixed with nitric and hydrochloric acids. Nitric acid is some- 
times used in textile printing, in the making of certain pigments, 
especially the chrome compounds, the making of potassium nitrate, 
fulminate and celluloid. In the latter process cellulose is dissolved 
in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids. Telegraph batteries may 
contain nitric acid. In all these processes the workmen are subject, 
from time to time, to toxic effects, and in many of them deaths have 
been reported. Motagne, in his Paris Thesis of 1901, reported 38 
cases of poisoning by nitrous fumes, one-half of which terminated 
fatally. I saw- recently, in a powder factory, a case of chronic 
atrophic rhinitis due to handling nitrate of soda in making black 
powder. 

It has been shown by Hoppe-Seyler that nitrogen binoxid gas 
forms a stable compound with the blood, interfering with its normal 
oxidation, and in experiments with animals Eulenberg produced with 
nitrous acid fumes salivation, tremors, dyspnea, restlessness and fatal 
convulsions. Death ensued in less than 20 minutes, and at autopsy 
the meninges and brain were hyperemic, the lungs were congested and 
the right heart distended. 

In an autopsy performed upon a workman who died from in- 
haling nitrous acid fumes, Tardieu and Roussin found the lungs 
were softened, emitted a strong nitrous odor and gave an acid re- 
action. 

Nitrous acid is converted into nitric acid in the presence of the 
oxygen of the blood. 

Symptoms. Nitrous poisoning may be either acute or chronic. 

ACUTE TYPE. The acute form, owing to numerous accidents in 
connection with handling nitrous products, occurs more often and 
is far more dangerous than the chronic type. In mild acute cases 
the skin is reddened, the conjunctiva? are congested, and digestive 
disturbances such as dyspepsia and colic are observed. There are 
also dry cough and moderate dyspnea, with a feeling of constric- 
tion at the throat. In severe acute cases an intense bronchitis re- 



374 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

suits within a few hours after the inhalation, which rapidly becomes 
capillary in type. It is accompanied by intense dyspnea, both sub- 
jective and objective. The victim becomes anxious and restless, 
there is severe cough, at first dry, later accompanied by a profuse 
watery, yellowish expectoration or bronchorrhea. Deep cyanosis is 
observed, with exophthalmos and coldness of the extremities. The 
patient vomits, and passes into a stage of delirium and final con- 
vulsions. A few years ago a number of workmen were unloading 
from a vessel at a dock in New York carboys of nitric acid, some 
of which becoming accidentally broken, their contents flowed over the 
wooden floor, producing dense clouds of acid vapor. The workmen 
were immediately overcome with suffocation and in a few hours 
intense capillary bronchitis developed, which was .fatal in several 
instances. The action of nitrous compounds upon wood evolves 
large quantities of vapor very rapidly. 

An unusual accident occurred in the Gunnison Tunnel in 1911. 
A blast was exploded, and 13 men inhaled the smoke at some dis- 
tance. In less than 3 days 9 of these men died from acute inflam- 
mation of the lungs. It was found that nitrous fumes, consisting 
of nitrogen tetroxid or dinitryl (N 2 O 4 ) had been developed from 
the powder smoke by the electric power current. (C. Johnson.) 

A number of years ago a gallon jar of nitro-hydrochloric acid 
was upset on the wooden floor of my physiological laboratory, at 
once filling the room with irritant fumes. Despite protest, an assist- 
ant rushed into the room to open the windows, covering his mouth 
with a wet towel. He lingered less than two minutes, but acquired 
a severe bronchitis which lasted several days. The brown fumes 
which poured out of the window were so dense that someone passing 
in the street mistook them for smoke and turned in a fire alarm! 

CHRONIC TYPE. The chronic type of nitrous poisoning is char- 
acterized by cough, more or less mucous expectoration, moderate 
dyspnea, vertigo and anemia. There is marked redness and swell- 
ing of the respiratory mucosa, which bleeds readily when touched. 
Among 26 workmen in a nitric acid factory, Kobert found several 
with erosions of the nasal septum and one with a perforated septum. 

Treatment. The capillary bronchitis demands active measures 






TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 375 

for relief. Heart stimulants should be given hypodermatically, 
mustard pastes should be applied to the chest, and, if there is an 
excess of watery secretion from the lungs, atropin (gr. 1/100) 
should be given hypodermatically. The burning of the throat may 
be relieved by inhalations of steam from a croup kettle, and codein 
may relieve the discomfort of the cough, but morphin is not a very 
safe remedy in these cases. 

OSMIC ACID 

This acid, when its fumes are inhaled, causes severe irritation 
of the Schneiderian membrane, with inflammation. Bronchitis also 
may be present. 

PICRIC ACID 

Picric acid is derived from the action of nitrous acid on phenol, 
and carelessness in construction of the retorts may liberate nitrous 
fumes. It is used in making certain explosives, such as melanite, 
and in photography and various chemical industries. 

When volatilized it gives rise to anorexia, bronchitis, cough, and 
anemia. It is eliminated by the urine, from which it has been 
recovered. As a dust or in powder it causes^ when inhaled, irritation 
in the nose, with sneezing and increased secretion. It also colors 
yellow any unprotected parts of the skin with which it comes in 
contact. Air which is dust-laden with powdered picric acid ex- 
plodes very readily, so that the hearing of workmen employed in 
picric acid manufacture is frequently impaired. (F. Ropke.) Con- 
junctivitis is also common among them. 

SULPHURIC ACID 

This acid has many uses in the arts and manufactures, and those 
who are engaged in making or handling it may become poisoned by 
its fumes, and often sustain serious erosions of the skin, should 
the acid come into contact with it. 

The acid is used in burnishing iron and steel, in sugar refineries 
and starch factories, hat and textile works, the making of powdered 



376 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

fertilizers, refining linseed oil, petroleum distillation, patent wood 
floorings and many other industries. 

Guano is treated with about 25 per cent, of sulphuric acid to 
neutralize the ammonium carbonate and make the calcium phosphate 
soluble. 

Sulphuric acid is also used in the refining and bleaching of tallow 
and to disintegrate bones used for fertilizers. It is used in electric 
accumulator works, and is developed in making coal gas. 

In the drawing of steel wire sulphuric acid is used, the fumes 
from which may prove very irritating, and sometimes lime is also 
used, the dust from which is injurious to the respiratory passages. 
The fumes of this acid produce symptoms similar to those of sul- 
phurous acid, but they are considerably less severe. When inhaled 
they give rise to rhinitis and acute and chronic catarrh of the 
bronchi. The acid may cause bronchopneumonia. It provokes con- 
junctivitis and in time causes erosion of the teeth. Its use as a 
dilute lemonade for lead workers does little more than injure the 
teeth. (See page 368.) When spattered on the skin it causes severe 
pain and a brownish white eschar, with much local redness and 
edema. Absorption after widespread local acid burns has been 
known to cause duodenal ulceration, stupor and death. 

One of my patients was a man 41 years of age who for 4 years 
had been employed for several hours daily testing milk fat and 
washing copper vessels, using sulphuric acid. When seen he was 
extremely weak and dyspneic and had an advanced secondary anemia, 
with hemoglobin 40 per cent, and red blood cells 3,800,000. 

CHININ 

Chinin is a petroleum by-product which gives rise to local cuta- 
neous irritation, especially of the face and arms, but frequently of 
the entire body. The itching, which is intense, accompanies a scaly 
eczema. 

CHINON 

Dyers of yarn who are exposed to fumes from a hot mixture of 
anilin, hydrochloric acid and potassium chromate are affected by the 



TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 377 

escape of chinon vapor which causes serious keratitis. The cornea 
becomes dark brown and the epithelium is undermined (Senn). The 
skin becomes bronzed. Recovery follows abandonment of the occu- 
pation. 

METOL 

Metol is used in conjunction with other chemicals in photog- 
raphy. Mrs. S. R. Karasek and Dr. M. Karasek found 31 cases 
of poisoning by this substance in 40 photographic studios visited in 
Chicago. 

Metol gives rise to an erythematous rash of the skin which comes 
in contact with it, i. e., of the hands and arms, but it may involve 
the whole body. Like many toxic rashes, it may disappear after a 
short time, but in the more severe cases intractable ulcers develop 
which may last for months. Persons susceptible to this poison do 
not become immune, but have recurrent outbreaks of the local irrita- 
tion. The use of rubber gloves affords complete protection. 

NITROGLYCERIN 

This is a colorless, odorless oily fluid which easily vaporizes. It 
is used in making dynamite, nitrocellulose and other high explosives. 
It is also used in medicine to reduce arterial tension, and the mak- 
ing of nitroglycerin tablet triturates sometimes causes mild toxic 
symptoms. 

Nitroglycerin was originally used as an explosive in fluid form, 
but it was so uncertain in effect as to be very hazardous. Subse- 
quent to the discovery by Nobel that it could be held by an absorbent 
in a condition of stability, various substances, such as earth containing 
fossil infusoria, wood pulp, etc., have been used for this purpose. 
Most dynamite, of which upward of 250,000,000 Ibs. are manufac- 
tured annually in the United States, is composed of wood pulp, 
nitrate of soda, which supplies oxygen to enhance explosive force, 
and a varying per cent, of nitroglycerin, up to 75 per cent., which 
is within the limits of safety for transportation. Various strengths 
are used for different purposes, and a dynamite of 20 per cent, nitro- 



378 DISEASES DUE TO IEEITANT SUBSTANCES 

glycerin is not necessarily poor in efficiency, though it may be in 
speed of explosion. 

In Europe nitrate of ammonium is much used as an ingredient 
of the variety of dynamite employed in blasting. Another form of 
violent and hazardous explosive is the so-called "gelatin powder," 
made usually with 90 per cent of nitroglycerin and 10 per cent, 
of guncotton. 

Other explosive ingredients which have been used in combina- 
tion are picric acid and potassium chlorate, but their great instability 
renders them unfit for most purposes. Dinitrotoluene and trinitro- 
toluene are also used, as well as several derivatives from them. 

Nitroglycerin gains access to the circulation with greatest facil- 
ity, being absorbed in all three ways, through the skin, alimentary 
canal and respiratory channels. So sensitive is the skin to this 
poison in some persons that by merely shaking hands with a work- 
man who has just been handling giant powder they may acquire full- 
ness and throbbing pain in the head^the "nitroglycerin head," as 
the workmen call it. Miners using blasting powder have been known 
to carry enough nitroglycerin home in their clothing, contaminated 
by fumes of ill-burned powder, to affect several members of the 
family. 

There is the greatest possible variability in the susceptibility to 
nitroglycerin poison. Some persons can dip the whole arm into a 
pail of it without experiencing any subsequent headache or other 
discomfort, and others can barely touch a stick of dynamite with 
the finger without absorbing sufficient poison to make themselves 
most uncomfortable. Doubtless this diverse susceptibility is de- 
pendent upon differences in intravascular pressure, thickness of the 
walls of the arterioles, and of the integument, besides which there 
may be other individual idiosyncrasies. The same variability is no- 
ticed in the effect of the medicinal use of nitroglycerin in different 
patients, as it is with the nitrites of sodium and potassium, amyl 
nitrite and similar vasomotor drugs. 

E. S. Evans, of Iowa, has reported a case of nitroglycerin poison- 
ing in a farmer who used giant blasting powder to clear away tree 
stumps. He was thus employed for a fortnight and wore cotton- 



TOXIC FLUIDS: ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 379 

flannel gloves in handling the powder. The wearing of the gloves 
for some time after repeatedly produced symptoms, and it was evi- 
dent that they had retained nitroglycerin, which was absorbed by the 
man's hands. He suffered from violent headache, vertigo and vomit- 
ing. (Jour. Amer. Med. Assoc., Feb. 24, 1912.) 

Symptoms.- The symptoms of nitroglycerin poisoning are well 
known both to physicians and laymen. They may develop almost 
immediately or after half an hour, and are due largely 1sp relaxation 
of the arterioles, with consequent fullness and congestion. The 
superficial capillaries in the skin of the face are congested so that 
the face is flushed and the conjunctivae are injected. A pounding 
headache, vertigo, tinnitus and sometimes nausea are the cerebral 
symptoms. Frequent fainting attacks may occur. There may be 
temporary blindness. These symptoms are made much worse by 
stooping or lying down, so the poisoned miner sits with his head in 
his hands, or may be rendered almost maniacal by the pains, as C. E. 
Laws says, "running about, shouting, and striking his head against 
obstacles." The pain may be localized bilaterally in any part of the 
head or be general. Urination is frequent and the urine is pale and 
of low specific gravity. Aphrodisiac effects have been observed. 

The heart action is at first accelerated, then retarded. Some years 
ago, by means of a camera which I devised for making investigations 
of cardiac stimulants by means of instantaneous photography applied 
in various ways to the beating heart in living animals, I found that 
nitroglycerin dropped upon the exposed heart of a frog or other ani- 
mal gave rise to an extremely firm systole, and I have a number of 
photographs demonstrating its direct local primary stimulation of 
the heart action. If introduced more slowly into the general cir- 
culation by relaxing the vascular tension, like all the nitrites, it 
lessens the work of the heart and modifies its rate of beating accord- 
ingly. 

As further symptoms, nausea, vomiting and colic occur. There 
may be paralyses in the muscles of the head, eyes and limbs. Respi- 
ration becomes slow and stertorous. Dyspnea and cyanosis are 
marked. In some cases, following explosions, there are tremors with 
coma, recovery of consciousness, an intermittent feeble pulse, motor 



380 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

paralysis, subsequent return of syncope or coma, and death results. 

Long-continued exposure to nitroglycerin fumes produces certain 
chronic symptoms, such as tremors, neuralgia and dyspepsia, al- 
though some degree of immunity from its disagreeable effects may 
be acquired in time. To quote from Laws, whose experience has 
been extensive with miners in the State of Washington (Jour. Amer. 
Med. Assoc., March 5, 1910) : "All who work in it are sooner or 
later troubled with dyspnea and tachycardia on exertion. Alcohol 
causes a flushing in eome that very much resembles scarlet fever. 
Others are unable to touch it at all, and it is a well-known fact that 
'powder men' become easily intoxicated." In order to maintain 
immunity the workmen, in periods of non-employment, sometimes 
"rub a small amount ir.to the skin or keep some on the hat band, so 
that they may always be in condition." 

Treatment. Treatment of nitroglycerin poisoning is unsatisfac- 
tory. The patient should eat heartily, previously taking a hot bath. 
If sleep can be secured by an hypnotic such as codein or morphin, it 
is sometimes curative, but depressing hypnotics such as chloral and 
coal tar analgesics must be avoided. Subsequently strychnin may 
be given daily. 

PARAFFIN 

Paraffin is much used for waterproofing, as, for example, pro- 
tecting the containers in which explosives are packed. Dynamite 
cartridges made of paper are placed in open wire baskets and treated 
with a spray of melted paraffin. Melted paraffin is poured into con- 
duits for protection and insolation of electric systems. 

Symptoms.- Melted paraffin evolves vapors which, when inhaled, 
give rise to headache, vertigo, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastralgia, 
enteralgia, diarrhea, thoracic oppression, cold sweats and lassitude. 

Locally paraffin irritates the skin, especially the sebaceous glands, 
and a half-dozen cases of epithelioma have been traced to its use 
and reported by Bell, Wohlmann and others. It may give rise to 
pustular eczema of the hands, face and ears. 

To protect the hands they should be cleansed frequently in alka- 
line solutions and rubber gloves should be worn when possible. 



TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 381 

PARAPHENYLENDIAMIN 

Paraphenylendiamin, a petroleum by-product, is extremely likely 
to give rise after long-continued inhalation to severe vesical irrita- 
tion, with passage of bloody urine, a condition which frequently has 
proved fatal. 

PETROLEUM 

Crude petroleum, or coal oil, as well as many of the products 
distilled from it at various temperatures, is a source of considerable 
cutaneous and other irritation, especially among workmen who are 
unhygienic in their habits. Thus Berthensen (who, in 1895, made 
a special study of the workmen employed in the petroleum wells of 
Tartary and Persia) found that, among 8,465 workmen, 1,216 had 
various skin eruptions and 1,475 suffered from respiratory diseases. 
In this country modern methods of distillation, refining and trans- 
portation of petroleum and its products, now largely carried out by 
mechanical means, have reduced the hazards to a minimum. Clean- 
ing out petroleum tanks is one of the chief risks, and in general the 
lightest products of distillation evolved at the lowest temperatures 
are the most toxic and may decompose or liberate the hemoglobin 
from the red blood cells. Experimentally, in animals, inhalation of 
these products gives rise to congestion of the lungs and kidneys. 
Some of the petroleum oils are much more irritating than others, as 
they spring from the wells. 

Symptoms. Symptoms of petroleum poisoning may be acute or 
chronic. 

ACUTE TYPE. The acute form, known sometimes as "petroleum 
intoxication," may be very acute and promptly fatal. The victim is 
seized with sudden weakness of the legs and dyspnea. He may fall 
down in coma and die of asphyxia on entering a non-ventilated, par- 
tially emptied reservoir. Korjenewsky reported the case of a man 
who worked for a day at a petroleum well, when he was seized with 
hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena and delirium, and died the follow- 
ing day. 

The comatose cases are not always fatal and a patient may remain 



382 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

in coma for a week and yet recover. In very mild cases some of 
the workmen complain of vertigo, headache, nausea, bronchitis and 
mental depression, but others have a feeling of elation and rather 
like the intoxication. 

CHRONIC TYPE. Chronic poisoning causes vertigo, fullness and 
throbbing of the head, cough and dyspnea, anemia, general nervous- 
ness, hallucinations, and loss of memory. There may be attacks of 
syncope and loss of consciousness. The effects vary with different 
persons, some being excited and others calmed, as if they were under 
the influence of opiates. Suppurating ulcers of the skin may form 
and refiners may develop a special type of papilloma. 

Prevention. Special care should be exercised at all pumps, reser- 
voirs, tanks, conduits, etc., ,to prevent leakage and accumulation of 
dense vapors where they might be inhaled. Workmen should take 
frequent hot-water baths, using soap freely, and should have their 
overalls washed often. As a rule, in American refineries the work- 
men are well protected so that serious poisoning is uncommon. 

PHENYLHYDRAZIN 

This is a pungent, brownish-yellow, oily fluid derived as a by- 
product in making antipyrin from anilin, and used in connection 
with various organic compounds. Its action is local upon the skin, 
causing itching and burning with a vesicular eruption. When ab- 
sorbed it causes granular degeneration of the erythrocytes and diges- 
tive disturbances with diarrhea. 

PYRIDIN 

This substance is a pungent, colorless fluid derived during manu- 
facture of coal tar, and sometimes added in denaturing alcohol, to the 
toxic effects of which it contributes, as used in hat making, gilding, 
furniture and wood polishing in general. As a vapor when inhaled 
it causes choking, hoarseness and laryngitis, with headache, vertigo, 
tremors and weakness of the extremities. Dyspnea is marked and 
there may be clonic convulsions. Such poisoning is rare and a few 



TOXIC FLUIDS : ACIDS AND MISCELLANEOUS FLUIDS 383 

cases only are recorded. As a fluid, in contact with the hands, it 
gives rise to eczema. 

TAR AND PITCH 

Tar and pitch or bitumen, when melted, produce irritant fumes, 
and contact with the skin .develops serious local lesions. Various 
light oils are distilled from tar at temperatures of 100 to 200 C. 
Rectification is accomplished with sulphuric acid and soda. 

Symptoms. Inhalation of tar fumes may cause headache, vertigo, 
tinnitus, anemia, nausea, dyspepsia and diarrhea. Bronchial asthma, 
bronchitis, angina and coryza may develop. In serious cases of 
poisoning there may be mental and nervous symptoms, such as alter- 
nating depression and exaltation, paresis, muscular cramps, hyperes- 
thesia or other sensory disturbances. Suppurative otitis may occur 
and the urine is dark in color. 

LOCAL SYMPTOMS. "Tar itch" is the name given by the work- 
men to the pruritus which affects the hands or various parts of the 
body from clothing saturated with tar fumes in processes of distilla- 
tion, boiling, etc. The skin may be bronzed and an eruption resem- 
bling psoriasis or ichthyosis may appear. Conjunctivitis and ulcers 
of the nasal cavities and mouth may be observed. Handling wood 
which has been treated with tar as well as creosote as a preservative 
may give rise to considerable irritation of the skin, usually of the 
type of simple or pustular eczema or a scaly dermatitis. In the 
Bulletin of the New York State Bureau of Labor for 1912 it is 
stated that there were reported, "Two cases of poisoning by creosote 
of section-hands on two different railroads due to handling of ties 
treated with a preservative containing creosote. In one case the poi- 
soning was reported as on hands and arms, in the other on the face." 

There are many other fluid substances produced in the chemical 
industries which are highly toxic and which, from time to time, have 
furnished illustrations of poisoning. They are so infrequent, how- 
ever, as not to merit detailed descriptions. Examples of such sub- 
stances are thorium nitrate, carbon tetrachlorid, ammonium sulphate, 
nickel carbonyl, carburetted hydrogen (beet sugar industry), etc. 



384 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

IV. IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 

Dusts in General. The varieties of dusts generated in connection 
with industrial labor are well-nigh innumerable, but for convenience 
of study they may be classed by their origin briefly as follows: (1) 
mineral dusts, (2) metallic dusts, (3) vegetable dusts, (4) animal 
dusts, (5) dusts of mixtures of two or more of the preceding groups. 
The particles of dust vary in degrees of dryness, hardness, sharpness 
and coarseness. Dusts are not only irritating to the eyes, skin, hair 
and respiratory passages, but give rise to untidiness and discomfort. 
As J. S. Haldane says, in a lecture on "Dust Removal in Factories," 
delivered at Oxford in 1908, "It inevitably tends to lower the 
social status and self-respect of work people if they have to go back 
to their homes in the same untidy condition." The coal miner who 
walks through the streets to his home in dirty clothes, with face so 
begrimed that he is almost unrecognizable, carries much dirt into 
his rooms, and taxes his wife with effort to keep them habitable and 
presentable. 

Frederick L. Hoffman, writing of injurious dusts, says, "The 
morbidity and mortality of wage-earners are high or low in almost 
exact proportion as the air conditions are those of relative purity or 
impurity, of wholesomeness or pollution." 

Dusts may be merely irritant, like flint dust, which is the most 
harmful of all the hard, sharp dusts, or poisonous, like lead dust, 
which is absorbed into the system, or, like flour dust, they may choke 
the respiratory passages without serious irritant or toxic properties. 
Moderately irritant dust, however, often gives rise to acute symp- 
toms among new workmen unaccustomed to its irritation, such as 
coughing, sneezing, fever, lassitude and pains in the eyes and head. 
Illustrations of similar conditions are found among the workers in 
horsehair, furs, feathers, tobacco, leather, skins, paper, and workmen 
in cotton and woolen mills, grain elevators, flour mills and saw mills. 

Attempts have been made to show in definite figures the relative 
hannfulness of the different types of dust of metallic, mineral, vege- 
table or animal origin, especially as gauged by favoring tuberculosis, 
but the figures given by various authors are so divergent as to be 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 385 

scarcely worth quoting. For example, Hirt gives the incidence of 
tuberculosis among 100 cases in workmen, assigning 25 per cent, as 
due to working in mineral dust and 13 per cent, in vegetable dust. 
Perlen, on the other hand, in reporting 1,425 tuberculosis cases at the 
Munich Poly clinic, assigns only 18 per cent, to mineral dust and 26 
per cent, to vegetable dust. 

There are two reasons for such discrepancies. In the first place, 
if a clinic happens to be located near a large stone-cutting or mill- 
stone plant, cases due to mineral dust will naturally predominate, 
whereas, if textile fabrics are made on a large scale near by, vege- 
table dust will figure largely in the statistics. Secondly, tubercu- 
losis is much more often due to lack of home hygiene and conditions 
arising from poor food, drink, etc., than to manufacturing conditions, 
which makes it extremely difficult to place the influence of the latter 
on a convincing statistical basis. In general, it may fairly be stated 
that the sharper, hard metallic and mineral dust particles do more 
mechanical injury to the bronchial mucosa than the softer dusts of 
vegetable or animal origin, and the latter are more liable to convey 
germs of various sorts into the respiratory passages. 

Of 68 patients among workers in textile industries treated in the 
Milan Clinic in 1910-1911, 19 presented blood disorders, 28 respi- 
ratory affections, 4 dry pleurisy, 12 tuberculosis, 20 nephroptosis, 5 
nervous diseases, 15 digestive disorders, 6 circulatory diseases, and 3 
diseases of the muscles. 

DUST EXPLOSION. The explosion of finely subdivided and widely 
disseminated dusts is a subject which concerns industrial accidents 
rather than diseases, and hence does not properly come within the 
scope of this book. Such explosions are liable to occur from time to 
time in sugar refineries where powdered sugar is made ; in linoleum 
works, where pulverized cork is used, etc. In a recent explosion 
from sugar dust ignition in an Austrian refinery the roof of the 
establishment was blown completely off, and in an explosion from 
dust in a grain elevator in Buffalo a large number of lives were lost. 

Quantity of Dust in the Atmosphere. The quantity of dust par- 
ticles which pollute the general atmosphere around certain chemical 
works, factories, smelting works, rolling mills, etc., is almost in- 



386 DISEASES DUE TO IKRITANT SUBSTANCES 

credible. It exercises a very deleterious influence not only on the 
general health of the workman, for it is the air nearest the factory 
which adds outside dust to the already polluted air of the workroom, 
but also of his family if they live in the immediate vicinity. It 
becomes difficult to keep home and clothing clean, and vegetation is 
so stunted or destroyed as to deprive the neighborhood of all growth 
of grass or trees which might render it more attractive. Time and 
again has been demonstrated the depressing effect upon the general 
health of a community, particularly of the children, of the deleterious 
influence of smoke and chemical fumes. It is difficult to put the 
matter in the form of numerical statistics, for the evil influences are 
subtle and operate over long periods of time, but everyone conver- 
sant with such environments knows how baneful, they are. In Pitts- 
burgh, in this country, in Leeds, in England, and in many towns in 
Germany and elsewhere special commissions are at present at work 
upon the scientific investigation of the evils of the smoke, fumes and 
gases arising from varied industries, and in many cases progress is 
being made to abate them. 

The University of Pittsburgh has constructed a smoke house 
18 x 30 feet square, where, under the direction of Dr. R. C. Bren- 
ner, experimental studies are made of dusts and fumes, such as those 
of ashes, tar, various gases, etc., particularly with reference to the 
workman's health. 

DUST ESTIMATION. Various methods exist for determining the 
density of atmospheric dust, some of which are based upon collecting 
by filtration or settling, and then weighing the dust from measured 
quantities of air; another, like that of John Aitken, is based upon 
the principle that aqueous vapor, when cooled in a confined space 
filled with dusty, air, condenses about each particle of dust, thus 
making a visible cloud of greater or less density. The apparatus 
consists essentially of a small closed chamber of definite size filled 
with dust-free air saturated with aqueous vapor. By means of an 
air pump a measured quantity of the dusty air to be tested is forced 
into the chamber. This dust-laden air forms a cloud of varying 
density, and comparison of this density with the quantity of air 
required to produce it may be made. The dust is then permitted 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 381 

to settle upon a ruled glass plate at the bottom of the chamber, when 
it may be illuminated with a mirror and its particles counted with a 
lens, as blood corpuscles are estimated. The measuring of dust by 
weight is less instructive than by count, for a heavy metallic dust 
will have far fewer particles than a much lighter coal dust, per 
pound. 

Dr. Walther Friese, of Dresden, furnishes a table derived from 
different observers with the Aitken apparatus (Ranch und Staub, 
March, 1912), which shows variations in the number of particles 
of dust per cubic millimeter of air, as follows : 

Mountain air with a sea breeze 72 

Fresh country air 500 

London air 300,000 to 500,000 

Paris air 400,000 to 500,000 

In the garden of the Meteorological Institute only 160,000 
Salon of an ocean steamer with open port holes. . . 775 

With closed port holes 22,060 

In the engine room of the steamer 985,000 

In an audience chamber before a meeting 175,000 

After the meeting 400,000 

Average of 32 daily observations on a voyage from 

Hamburg to South America 1,130 

Such measurements naturally are subject to great and instan- 
taneous fluctuations, depending upon wind, temperature, general 
cloudiness of the air, etc., but in the main they serve to emphasize 
the enormous preponderance of dust in the air of large manufac- 
turing and soft coal-consuming cities like London and Paris over 
ordinary country air. Such air often contains acids. (Fig. 58.) 

To collect dust for analysis from dusty workrooms and in dusty 
trades, several other forms of apparatus have been devised. A 
simple type, described by Dr. Norman E. Ditman, is figured here- 
with. (Fig. 59, p. 389.) A measured quantity of the air to be 
examined is drawn by an aspirating hand pump through a filter 
bottle packed with cotton wool. The cotton withholds all dust par-

weighing and analysis.

estimated at 76,000 tons, but during the past decade so much has 
been accomplished by the "anti-smoke and dust crusade" that the 
number of hours of bright sunshine has increased from an average 
of 70 per month to 93.5. In Chicago, since the establishment of

the Anti-Smoke Commission, in 1907, it is estimated by T. E. Don- 
nelly that the smoke nuisance has been abated 75 per cent. 

The most dangerous size of dust particles is a diameter of 0.005 
to 0.01 mm., for they are liable to be most deeply inhaled. 

Some idea of the quantity of dust capable of suspension under

ordinary conditions in factory workrooms may be gathered from the 
following estimates by Dr. C. T. Graham-Kogers, who has made a 
large number of air analyses with reference to dust content in dif- 
ferent industries, which are given in the Report of the New York

State Commissioner of Labor for 1911. In a skirt factory he found 
70 grains of dust per million liters of air, as much as he found in 
pearl button factories. In a brass foundry were 75.2 grains, of 
which 55.4 grains were silica from the sand moulds. In the finish- 
ing room of a felt hat factory there was .01 gram of silica in the 
dust. In a room occupied by cutters in the garment industry there 
were 59 grams of dust per million liters of air. 

In his study of the air in the New York Subway, Dr. G. A. 
Soper found its dust to contain iron, silica, cement, stone, cotton, 



390 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



wool, wood, molds and refuse of various sorts, 22 per cent, of the 
whole being organic. He found 61 milligrams of dust per 1,000 
cubic feet of air, and estimated that the average passenger inhaled 
milligram of this dust in half an hour's ride, which would be at 

the rate of 2.4 centigrams 
for the 24 hours. Of 
course anyone walking 
along a dusty street on a 
windy day inhales more 
than this, and the only 
reason the lungs do not 
completely choke up is the 
activity of the leukocytes 
in gathering up the dust 
and its entanglement in 
mucus and expectoration.

particularly where coal combustion products were abundant, as cop- 
per is a common ingredient of coal in minute quantities. In a shoe 
factory a very high percentage of copper oxid was found in the 
leather dust derived from the use of brass machinery for polishing the 
soles. He also found the dust of piano manufactories to contain con- 
siderable copper. Numerous particles of iron and felt were present 
in this dust. 

Although dust of every kind is a menace to health, it is in its 
relationship to tuberculosis that dust in general produces the greatest 
harm. This it may do (1) by irritating the lungs and maintaining 
constant catarrhal processes, (2) by conveying tuberculosis germs, 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 



391 



(3) by making preexisting tuberculosis much worse through inces- 
sant irritation of the lungs and catarrh. (See Tuberculosis, page 
53.) 

Prevention of Dust. The question of dealing with dusty trades 
may be subdivided into (1) checking the formation of dust, (2) 
checking the escape of dust, (3) dust removal, (4) prevention of 
distribution of dust. 

(1) CHECKING THE FORMATION OF DUST. Dust formation 
may be checked by sprays or jets of water, steam or oils in many

industries, like rock drilling (Fig. 61), pottery cleaning, brick mak- 
ing, metal grinding, etc., where the nature of the substances dealt 
with permits the application of moisture without injury to the 
product. In fact, in many forms of drilling and grinding the mois- 
ture lessens friction and is an advantage to the process. Its appli- 
cation is usually easy and inexpensive and should be made wherever 
practicable. 



392 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



(2) CHECKING THE ESCAPE OF DUST. This may be accom- 
plished in such industries as stone crushing, the mixing of lead pig- 
ments, dusting pottery and china when removed from the kiln, clay 

grinding, etc., by enclosing 
the entire machinery used 
in a protecting case, which 
is opened only after the 
dust has settled after the 
completion of the process. 
Glass screens may some- 
times be employed t o 
shield the workman's eyes 
and face from flying parti- 
cles of dust, but flint and 
steel soon make the glass 
opaque, and it cannot, 
therefore, be of much serv- 
ice for protection against 
the dust of grinding. In 
some industries, like that 
of knocking the loose flint 
from pottery, for exam- 
ple, or sand-blast scour- 
ing of pottery and china, 
the dusty work may be 
conducted inside a cabi- 
net into which the work- 
man inserts his hands 
through a small cloth-cov- 
ered opening. (Fig. 62.) 

Another protective method consists in letting heavy dust particles 

drop into a trough of water. 

(3) DUST REMOVAL. The removal of dust may be accom- 
plished when neither of the foregoing methods is practicable by the 
use of exhaust fans in connection with hoods or collecting tubes, 
which should always be placed as close as possible to the source of 




FIG. 62. CHINA SCOURING BY SAND BLAST, 
IN A CABINET. (Royal Worcester Porce- 
lain Works, England.) The workman in- 
serts the china article through a canvas 
opening, holding it against a scouring wheel 
within the cabinet from which dust is re- 
moved by a strong exhaust air current. The 
dust contains lead glaze and emery. (From 
Shaw Lecture by William Burton, F.C.S., 
on "Hygiene of the Pottery Trade," Royal 
Society of Arts, London, Feb. 7, 1908.) 



IEEITANT DUSTS AND FIBEES

the dust. (Fig. 63.) By so doing the dust is collected before there 
is opportunity for its dissemination in the workroom, and less power 
is required to operate the exhaust fans. To attempt to eliminate 
dust from the entire atmosphere of a workroom by any system of

ING WHEEL. Diamond polishing. 

forced ventilation necessitates changing a large volume of air and 
creating strong intake drafts to replace it. Moreover, in winter 
this requires increased expenditure for heating. 

The fans in common use are either of the propeller or centrifugal 
type, but the latter are preferable as working better, against outdoor 
wind, requiring smaller ducts and having little tendency to permit 
backward currents. It is impossible with some dust-producing ma- 



394 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

chinery to place the exhaust tube very near, or the motion of the 
machinery itself may produce counter-currents. In such cases it is 
sometimes possible to employ an additional motor fan in the open 
workroom, so placed as to direct an air current away from the work- 
man and toward the entrance to the exhaust duct. Large looms, 




FIG. 64. SIFTER FOR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS. Note entire lack of dust pro- 
tection. (From the Bulletin of the Illinois State Department of Factory 
Inspection, 1911.) 

carding, hackling and rag-tearing machines cannot be boxed in, and 
in such cases it is best as far as possible to direct the currents of 
dust-laden air downward and remove it by ducts near or under the 
floor. (See Fig. 19, page 110.) 

One of the commonest errors in forced ventilation instalments 
in factories is the admission of air at the lowest part of the room, 
so that an upward current of dust is borne toward the workman's 
face. Wherever the trade is a dusty one the intake should be a few 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 395 

feet above the operator's head, and the outlet just at the level of 
the baseboard of the floor, so that dust, which naturally tends to 
fall, is drawn downward and outward. 

An ingenious method has been devised to protect wool-sorters 
from dust. The wool is sorted upon a fine-meshed wire screen which 
fits over the entrance to an exhaust duct, so that all dust is drawn 
downward away from the workman and does not fly about the room 
at all. This is practically the same as the method shown in Fig- 
ure 82, page 436. 

Emery grinding wheels and buffing wheels are now almost uni- 
versally protected with close-fitting exhaust hoods, leaving only a 
portion of the wheel exposed, but so little appreciation do many 
workmen have of the danger to their lungs that they often deliber- 
ately remove the hoods which annoy them. As both emery and metal 
dust are heavy and the velocity of the grinding wheels is great, this 
type of dust is projected in a fairly circumscribed stream, so that it 
is easily directed into a hood. 

In any system of exhaust ducts it is necessary to provide free 
entrance of an equal volume of air in the room to that removed or 
the exhaust will lose in power. 

The whole question of the size and shape of exhaust ducts and 
the proper adjustment of the fans, etc., has been made the subject of 
an admirable study by Dr. J. S. Haldane, of Oxford University, 
in a lecture before the Royal Society of Arts on February 28, 1908. 
Supplementary factors in dust removal concern (a) the construction 
of workrooms and (8) the cleaning of workrooms. 

(a) Workrooms in which dusty trades are conducted should be 
constructed with as little surface on which dust may lodge as pos- 
sible. Exposed girders, shelves, etc., should be avoided as far as 
possible. Walls should be smooth and without unnecessary angles, 
and corners should be rounded. Machinery should not be so crowded 
as to form inaccessible places in which dust may accumulate. 

(b) The workroom should be swept daily after work hours, so 
that any dust raised may settle before morning, and the floors, tables 
and benches should be mopped frequently. Sprinkling should pre- 
cede sweeping whenever the nature of the industry permits. Floors, 



396 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

when possible, should be of hard material and not unnecessarily en- 
cumbered. 

The question of dust and the workman's body is discussed under 
Personal Hygiene of the Workman on page 113. 

(4) PREVENTION OF DISTRIBUTION OF Toxic GASES AND FUMES, 
IRRITANT DUSTS, ETC. To prevent the poisoning of the atmospheric 
air in the vicinity of smelting works and chemical works of various 
sorts, or its pollution with soot, various methods are in vogue. Some 
of them have the economic advantage not only of protecting the 
health of the worker and nearby residents, but of saving considerable 
metal or other material which might otherwise be wasted. 

(a) One of these methods is to provide large settling chambers 
in which suspended particles may settle in time by gravitation. Such 
are used by the Tennessee Copper Company to collect deposit from 
the gases of their smelting ovens. 

(b) Another method, applicable only to large particles, is to cause 
them to aggregate by application of centrifugal force in revolving 
drums, etc. 

(c) A third method is to force the dust or vapor through 
mechanical filters such as wire mesh or cloths. In the Mammoth 
Copper Company's works in California is the largest plant of this 
sort, which consists of 3,000 woolen sheets through which 300,000 
cubic feet of air may be forced per minute. 

(d) A method in very general use is to treat the dust, gas or 
vapor with a jet of water or steam. In the Rowntree Cacao Works, 
for example, a saving of 10 per cent, of the fuel consumed is re- 
covered in this manner. 

(e) Various substances are sometimes added to neutralize toxic 
fumes. 

(f) Superheating and recombustion is a method which further 
reduces many deleterious fumes and gases. 

(g) To a limited extent electro-magnets have been employed to 
collect iron or steel dust, but this method is not practicable upon a 
large scale. 

(h) Dust and Smoke Precipitation by Electricity. Particles of 
soot, coal and other dust suspended in gases of combustion may be

precipitated by passing through an electrical zone. A special re- 
search in this subject was conducted, in 1911, by K. C. Benner at 
the University of Pittsburgh. It has been known for some time that 
such dusts as licopodium, sulphur precipitate, etc., would arrange 
themselves in peculiar rings and 
figures under the influence of a 
strong electric "breeze," and this 
principle has been practically 
applied, so that soot particles, 
for instance, on passing through 
a long duct or chimney, on 
reaching an electrified zone, 
have their velocity of motion so 
slowed that they fall in precipi- 
tation, being attracted by the 
electrodes. If the dust particles 
are metallic, they may show dis- 
tinct polarization. In some 
cases the ions tend to aggrega- 
tion with each other, forming 
balls. To accomplish the elec- 
tric separation and retardation 
of moving smoke particles of 
coal combustion, for example, 
a current of 20,000 or 40,000 
volts is passed through a rotat- 
ing commutator and projected

The two lateral cylinders serve, one

from a brush as a "breeze" or in the form of a circular "corona" 
through which the smoke or dust is made to pass. The electric field 
may be as much as 30 feet in length, and as much as 30 pounds of 
dust an hour may be precipitated, depending, of course, upon the 
nature of the material treated. In the Portland Cement Works 
of Riverside, California, from 95 to 98 per cent, of the cement 
dust has been extracted by this method from escaping gases. (See 
page 402.) 

(i) Respirators or inhalers are constructed with the object of 



398 DISEASES DUE TO IEEITANT SUBSTANCES 

filtering smoke, dust, gases and fumes out of the air. To this end 
they are constructed with simple screens, of cloth, wire, etc., or with 
loose, removable filter material, such as wool, cotton or sponge, con- 
tained within the appliance, which may be moistened with glycerin or 
other adhesive substance. They should be adapted to fit closely over 
both nose and mouth. (Fig. 65.) For temporary purposes they 
are very essential and serviceable, as, for example, to be worn on 
entering the "blue beds" in lead works to remove the lead carbonate 
(See page 212), or whenever metallic or acid fumes are liberated 
suddenly, as on opening ovens, boiling kettles, vats, etc. For per- 
manent use, also, they are absolutely necessary in some industries, 
as in the sandblasting of metal castings, etc., but in many industries, 
such as glass cutting, emery grinding, pottery scouring, etc., while 
they theoretically should be worn constantly, such use is practically 
beset with so many difficulties that workmen often will not tolerate 
them, especially if their hours of work are long. Some, especially 
women, object to their looks. It is difficult to speak plainly through 
them. They interfere with chewing tobacco, expectorating, blowing 
the nose, etc., and are often uncomfortably hot, and become heavy 
when clogged with dust. The latter difficulty is most serious, for 
with permanent use the filtering material becomes so clogged that 
it is difficult to secure sufficient air circulation, and the wearer re- 
breathes his own exhalations. 

Workmen frequently prefer to make use of improvised respi- 
rators. For example, men employed in barreling chrome pigments, 
white lead, lime, and similar irritants tie a wet towel or bit of cheese- 
cloth over the nose and mouth. A simple respirator may be fash- 
ioned with a cambric bag tied over a wire bent to fit over nose and 
mouth. In general such a simple device is more apt to be used by 
the workman than a more elaborate manufactured respirator, which 
he often will pull down and hang around his neck while at work in 
a cloud of dust ! 

When valve respirators are used the valves frequently become 
rusty from the exhaled moisture of the breath, or otherwise out of 
order, so that complete closure of the respirator fails. If, as in the 
case of the glass-making industry, there may be a dust containing 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 399 

90 per cent, of alkaline material, it unites with the sweat of the face 
and causes irritation of the skin at the points of contact of the 
respirator. If wet cloths be bound over the nose and mouth, and if 
the dust contains lead or arsenic, the repeated removal and replacing 
of the cloths in order to wet them may seriously irritate the lips. 



! 




FIG. 66. PROTECTIVE MASK WITH CELLULOID EYE-SHIELD FOR SANDBLASTING, 
CLEANING STONE BUILDINGS, ETC. 



Another objection to the use of respirators is that many of the 
cheaper grades sold are worse than useless, for they become clogged 
with dirt and afford a false security which leads to neglect of meas- 
ures of thorough ventilation. Schablowski (Zeitschrift fur Hygien. 
und Infect ions-krankheiten, 1911, Ixviii, 169) reports the results of 
tests of 37 different kinds of respirators and masks. Twenty-six of 
these admitted fully 30 per cent, of dust, some of them admitting 
89 per cent. An absolutely dust-proof mask requires so much force 
to aspirate sufficient air through it that it can only be used for emer- 
gencies, as in entering a room filled with dust and gas after an 



400 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

explosion, or on opening a dusty oven, as in the pottery trade, or 
while barreling chrome or lead pigment, etc. 

Naturally much depends upon the kind of dust dealt with, and 
protecting masks may keep out much irritant sharp, hard dust, as in 
sandblasting of castings, emery grinding of steel, glass, etc., whereas 
they may not keep out finer coal or cement dust. 

Some dusts are heavy and soon fall to the ground. If directed in 
a stream toward the workman's face they may be dodged by using a 
respirator and occasionally turning the head. Lighter dusts, on the 
other hand, become universally diffused in the workroom and soon 
clog the respirator, whether it be made of wire mesh, linen, cotton or 
batiste. In sandblasting a head mask and hood may be worn, pro- 
tected in front by a mica or celluloid window, and having the air 
admitted at the back. (Fig. 66.) 

A. INSOLUBLE INORGANIC DUSTS 

ASPHALT 

Workers in asphalt who stand over the melting pots are exposed 
to the irritating greenish-yellow fumes which arise. They acquire 
catarrhal conjunctivitis and bronchitis. A uniform eruption may 
appear over the entire body, which becomes of a yellowish color. 
(Weyl.) Four cases of asphalt poisoning were reported by Kemp 
in the Zeitschrift fur med. Beamte, 1903, s. 271. 

CEMENT 

Portland cement is composed of a mixture of limestone and clay 
which is roasted in rotating drums and then ground to the fineness of 
meal. It contains much silicic acid and is highly hygroscopic. 
Some cements contain feldspar and calcium carbonate. The roasting 
or drying of the cement is conducted in ovens sometimes 100 feet 
long, which are heated by oil fuel to a temperature as high as 450 C. 
W. A. Schmidt, describing such an oven, Y feet in diameter, states 
that it may develop 50,000 cubic feet of gas per minute, from which 4 
or 5 tons of dust may settle in 24 hours. Cement, both in manufac- 



401 

ture, transportation and use, gives rise to much irritant dry dust 
which, on being inhaled, or becoming moistened with the secretion 
of the bronchial mucosa, is highly irritating. 

In the crushing and drying rooms where the limestone is first 
treated, and in barreling or bagging, the workmen are exposed to 
risk of bronchial and pulmonary irritation, as well as to irritation 
of the skin and conjunctiva?. In the better class of mills the crushing 
and grinding machinery is enclosed and connected with aspirating 
ducts or hoods through which the dust is drawn to settling rooms, 
where it is filtered or precipitated with water. The packing in sacks 
for transportation is sometimes also done by machinery. The work- 
men frequently further protect themselves by binding thin cloths 
over the nose and mouth or by wearing respirators. They often 
complete the filling of the sacks by adding a few handfuls of cemeiit 
to make up the full weight, thereby scattering much dust and irritat- 
ing the hands. Cleaning out the clinkers from the ovens in which 
the raw material has been roasted subjects the workmen to dry heat 
as well as coarse dust. 

Upon the whole, in proportion to the quantity of dust inhaled, 
cement dust, like coal dust, produces less damage to the respiratory 
system than might be supposed less than the harder, sharper flint 
or glass dust, although chronic bronchitis, asthma and pneumonoco- 
niosis may result from it. It causes considerable itching in the nose, 
to relieve which the workmen put their dusty fingers into the nose 
and scratch the septum. This only increases the trouble, and in 
some cases ulceration with perforation of the septum occurs, as in 
chromic acid poisoning. Workmen with sensitive skins sometimes 
scratch the dusty skin so that ulcers form which are so slow in heal- 
ing that they may be compelled to change their work. The cement 
dust mixes with the perspiration of the skin and gives rise to a general 
pruritus which the workmen call "cement itch." 

The residents of a town in Maryland recently appealed to the 
State Board of Health for relief on the ground that dust from neigh- 
boring cement works was seriously affecting their health. 

In Los Angeles successful use has been made in the large cement 
works of the electric process devised by Dr. F. G. Cottrell for alter- 



402 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

ing the electric resistance of the gases of combustion developed dur- 
ing the process of cement roasting. In passing through a large elec- 
trified chamber the ions electrify the dust and gas particles, which 
subsequently are arrested in their escape by precipitation upon the 
electrodes. The electrodes, placed in 20 rows, 5-15 cm. apart, are 
shaken free of the dust by an electric motor as it accumulates on 
them. By such means the air in the vicinity of sensitive orange 
and lemon groves may be kept reasonably pure and prevented from 
destroying the trees. 

DIAMONDS AND OTHEK PRECIOUS STONES 

The cutting and polishing of diamonds and other hard precious 
stones involves several hazards. The dust of these stones is exceed- 
ingly fine and hard, but is rarely inhaled in sufficient quantity to 
be injurious of itself. The stones, however, are ground and polished 
with emery and sand, and the dust of these materials is highly irri- 
tating. (See pages 395, 403.) The' stones, moreover, are imbedded 
in a leaden matrix, or a matrix of lead and zinc, to facilitate hand- 
ling such small objects, and may be held by copper wires. In the set- 
ting of precious stones in jewelry, etc., solder is often used, and both 
the imbedding in the matrix and soldering must be conducted over a 
gas jet which is directed to a fine point by a blowpipe. In this 
manner some of the metal is volatilized, and, as the work requires 
close vision, the fumes arising, as well as incompletely combusted 
gas, may be drawn into the lungs. Formerly charcoal was used to 
heat the metal, and the danger of carbon-monoxid poisoning was 
added. Cases of lead poisoning have thus occasionally been pro- 
duced in jewelry manufacture, and some of them have also been 
traced to the habit of moistening the lead matrix with the finger to 
clean away dust. 

Prevention. The work of jewelry soldering should always be 
conducted under a hood with a good exhaust, and the emery wheels 
used for grinding, cutting and polishing precious stones should be 
protected, whenever possible, by shields. (Figs. 29, page 190, and 
11, page 93.) 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 403 

EMEEY 

Emery is a very sharp, irritant form of dust to which the makers 
of emery wheels and emery polishing paper are exposed. A greater 
hazard, however, consists in the use of emery grinding wheels, es- 
pecially for smoothing castings, sharpening cutlery, cutting glass 
and polishing diamonds and other precious stones. In many indus- 
tries in which moist grinding or polishing is employed there is little 
risk from the wheels, but much dust lies oil the floor and rests upon 
various surfaces in the workshop, where it becomes very dry and is 
borne in the air. In industries in which water cannot be used to 
moisten the wheels the emery flies from the wheel in a constant 
stream. Emery paper also must usually be used dry. These haz- 
ards are illustrated under the various headings of the substances in 
the manufacture of which emery is employed. (See Figs. 27, 63, 
68, on pages 172, 393, 406.) 

Emery Grindstones. The emery is ground and pulverized in 
mills. The dust is then glued to paper to make emery paper for 
polishing, or mixed with some cement-like substance, moulded under 
pressure in the form of grinding wheels, and burned like pottery. 
All these processes stir up a great deal of injurious dust which acts 
by mechanically irritating the respiratory passages. The artificial 
emery stones must be ground into perfectly symmetrical form before 
they are ready for use. Among 23 persons employed in emery 
milling, Rb'pke found practically all had chronic nasopharyngeal 
catarrh, and 15 had dry atrophic mucous membranes of the upper air 
passages, 7 had otitis media and one a perforating ulcer of the nasal 
septum. The patients complained much of dryness of the nose and 
throat. 

Emery Grinding and Polishing. In grinding and polishing the 
operator sits at his work, unless the article to be sharpened be very 
long, like a scythe or sword. He bends over the wheel, resting his 
elbows on his knees to give purchase for firm pressure. In this 
position there is naturally some impairment of lung expansion. 

In Germany it is customary for the grinding wheel to rotate 



404 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

toward the operator, the sparks and dust flying downward toward 
the floor (Fig. 31 on page 194), but in England the custom is for 
the wheel to revolve away from the operator, with the dust flying 
upward, which is a less desirable method. The operator sits more 
nearly over the wheel and presses downward with outstretched arms. 
The quantity of dust from the wheel may be imagined from the fact 
that a wheel 30 inches in diameter and 4 inches broad in a month's 
constant use may be reduced to half its original diameter, and the 
objects which are ground or sharpened often lose 20 to 30 per cent, 
of their weight in the process. Polishing with Vienna chalk upon a 
wheel adds another type of dust, and when revolving metal or hair 
brushes are used fine dust particles of brass or hair are given off in 
considerable quantity. 

Both the wet and dry grinding processes are productive of catarrh 
of the nose, middle ear and bronchi, the former, because, despite 
every precaution, the workman is frequently wet, the latter because 
of the fine sharp emery stone or steel dust particles which he inhales. 
But the most serious hazard of the emery wheel grinder is found in 
the predisposition to tuberculosis which may follow chronic bronchial 
catarrh or pulmonary fibrosis. The mortality from tuberculosis among 
grinders is as high as in almost any other class of skilled workmen, 
amounting sometimes to 60 to 70 per cent, of all causes' of death. 
According to Moritz and Ilb'pke, there is scarcely a metal grinder to 
be found who, if long at work, does not present lesions of the nose, 
such as small erosions and ulcers over the cartilaginous septum, red- 
ness and swelling of the Schneiderian membrane, a tendency to epis- 
taxis, and more or less occlusion of the nasal passages. In a later 
stage the mucosa becomes atrophic and there is impairment of the 
sense of smell. Often, too, there is hyperesthesia of the bronchial 
mucosa, due to the irritation of dust and giving rise to a vexing dry 
cough. Middle ear disease is a further outcome of the chronic nasal 
catarrh, which is often accompanied by tinnitus and deafness. The 
eyes are more or less endangered from trauma in all emery steel grind- 
ing, from particles of dust which often fly off the wheel with such 
force as to be deeply imbedded in the cornea. The steel dust may be 
removed with the electromagnet. 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS

Prevention. There are two ways of protecting the grinder by 
shields and by strong exhaust currents of air. The wheel should be 
encased in metal, all except the comparatively small surface actually

WHEEL. A stream of water drips from the overhead pail, but the room is

needed for grinding. (Fig. 11, page 93.) Glass shields are use- 
less, for they soon become opaque, but sometimes metal shields may 
be so adjusted between the operator and wheel as to direct a part, at 
least, of the dust away from his face without restricting freedom of 




406 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

vision. The wheel should always be made to rotate away from the 
operator and he should learn to keep his face as far from it as pos- 
sible. Whenever practicable wet grinding under a stream of water 
should be used (Fig. 67), but unfortunately with many types of 
work this is not feasible. In all cases in grinding shops where many

wheels are employed there should be a strong exhaust fan operating 
through individual ducts which form part of the shield of the wheel. 
(Fig. 68.) Where large articles are being ground the operator 
should stand over a grating and the exhaust current may be made 
to operate beneath the floor through the grating. 

GLASS 

Glass workers are subject to four principal forms of occupation 
hazard, namely, (1) exposure to great heat; (2) mechanical and 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 407 

chemical dust irritation; (3) poisoning by certain metals such as 
lead oxid, zinc oxid or arsenic, used for coloring, etc. ; (4) irritation 
of the eyes from excessive heat and light. 

The raw materials, such as flint, sand, quartz, powdered marble, 
limestone, soda, Glauber's salt and potash, are finely ground and 
mixed, usually in open vessels, which is extremely dusty work. 

In the industry the men who attend the melting furnaces, known 
as "shearers," are subjected to great heat and intermittent glare of 
light. The heat of the workrooms may reach 140 F. and the work- 
men in winter are thus subjected to great changes of temperature in 
passing in and out. For glass blowing an iron tube four or five feet 
long is dipped into a molten mass of glass and rotated by hand until 
a sufficient mass adheres to the end. Into this mass the workman 
then blows expired air, and, if the mass be large, several workmen 
may have to blow in turn, passing the tube quickly from mouth to 
mouth. 

In the making of glass bottles the men work in groups of three, 
two of whom gather and blow the glass while the third smooths the 
neck and finishes the work. Such a group often turns out 250 to 300 
dozen finished bottles a day, according to size. Recently machines 
are coming into use for blowing bottles by compressed air, and the 
glass may also be gathered and moulded by machinery. 

For the making of glass-stoppered bottles accurate grinding of the 
necks becomes necessary, an occupation which is quite hazardous 
from the dissemination of glass and emery dust. Moreover, the 
bottles sometimes break and lacerate the face or hands or destroy 
an eye. 

The blowing of large glass carboys used to hold acids, etc., re- 
quires great expenditure of strength and skill. 

Small vials are made from glass tubing by means of gas jets 
and blowpipes. The men thus employed, from their use of gas jets, 
are known as "lamp-workers." Bottle making (Fig. 69) is one of 
the industries in which the employment of boy labor is essential for 
such purposes as shutting the moulds in which some bottles are cast, 
carrying finished bottles and other products, etc. 

Iron workers are also employed in the glass bottle industry to 



408 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

make the iron moulds and cut the lettering upon them, which is im- 
pressed upon certain types of bottles, but they are not subject to 
special hazard. 

Single glass vessels may, when cooled, have to be cut off by a

light and moisture. Note the primitive colored-glass eye-shield in a wooden 
frame suspended in front of the boy. 



diamond, and the rough edges are filed also a dusty occupation 
and fine glass splinters fly off. Or the cut surfaces may be smoothed 
on wet emery wheels while sand is added. Polishing is accom- 
plished with rotating brushes which are kept as moist as possible, but 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 409 

the heat of friction soon dries them and dust is scattered. Statistics 
of glass makers show a rather large percentage of illnesses, about one- 
third of which are classed as respiratory diseases. There are also 




FIG. 70. GLASS BLOWING. Hazards: excessive heat and light; possibility of 
overinflation of muscles of the cheeks and of Steno's ducts; irritation of 
skin of hands. 

many cases of digestive disorder (about 16 per cent.), rheumatism, 
eczema and other skin diseases, conjunctivitis and a few of lead 
poisoning. Cutaneous wounds are common and may become in- 
fected. 

Makers of plate glass lift very heavy masses at the ends of their 



410 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

blowpipes, which are heft! with the left arm outstretched (Fig. 70), 
so that often the left arm muscles are more developed than those of 
the right arm (C. F. Schmidt), and from the rotation of the pipes 
the skin of the palms becomes extraordinarily hypertrophied, moro 
so than in almost any other occupation. This is due to the heat of 
friction, pressure and a mixture of charcoal and wax or rosin some- 
times used to afford a better grip on the smooth iron blowpipes. 
Uneven, horny protuberances of the skin of the fingers may become 
quite painful, like corns. 

Syphilis may be transmitted by mouth infection by means of the 
blowpipes, and Eysell reported the occurrence of syphilitic mouth 
infection among 12 workmen, derived from one of their associates. 
In workmen who have been employed for a long time as glassblowers, 
white plaques may be seen in the mouth and on the lips, due to 
irritation of the rotated blowpipes and formed by thickening of the 
epithelial layers. The front teeth may become worn down from the 
same cause. The cheeks are distended by the constant blowing and 
there may be some degree of atrophy of their musculature (Schmidt). 
Air may be forced into the salivary ducts, causing widening of them, 
with painful swelling and deforming of the parotid glands. Schiele 
described this condition as "pneumatocele," or "emphysema of the 
ducts of Steno." Food may accumulate in the ducts and irri- 
tate them, and de la Faille reported a case of rupture of a duct 
following acute parotiditis, with emphysema of the subcutaneous 
tissues of the neck. Several other interesting cases of this form 
of pneumatocele have been reported by Liniger and Warat. 
(Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Chirurgie, Oct., 1912, cxix, pp. 201 and 
368.) 

The result of inhalation of so many kinds of dust, from the raw 
materials used, the particles of ground glass, and the grinding ma- 
terials, such as emery, etc., may give rise to pulmonary fibrosis and 
chronic bronchitis, which predispose to tuberculosis, but emphysema 
is not produced by glassblowing, as formerly supposed, despite the 
deep inspiration and prolonged expiration employed in the process. 
Emphysema is due to connective tissue changes in the lungs, and this 
disease is no more frequent among glassblowers than among any simi- 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 411 

lar group of workmen, when due regard is had for age, alcoholism, 
chronic pulmonary disease and other predisposing factors. 

Prettin and Leibkind (Munch, med. Woch., 1904) examined 
230 glassblowers who had been employed for 10 or more years, and 
found no cases of emphysema in those who were under 40 years of 
age, and only 5 cases, all told, in those who were older. Similar 
results were found by the late Dr. J. West Roosevelt, of New York, 
who some years ago examined a number of members of orchestras 
who played upon wind instruments and who showed no special pre- 
disposition for acquiring emphysema. 

The excessive heat to which glassblowers are exposed leads them 
to sweat excessively and they, therefore, drink copiously of water 
perhaps 8 or 10 quarts a day with the result of producing gastric 
catarrh. 

Cut glass is finished either by strong hydrofluoric or sulphuric 
acid, or by polishing on a wheel with putty powder, which is three- 
fourths lead oxid and one-fourth tin. (See Fig. 67, page 405.) As 
the powder, moistened to a paste, spatters about it dries, and the 
dust constitutes a serious menace from lead poisoning. It is among 
this class of workmen especially that tuberculosis prevails, and they 
usually appear pale and thin. According to Hirt, the average dura- 
tion of life among glass grinders, cutters and polishers is only 42.5 
years. 

The eye diseases of glass workers, due to heat and trauma, are 
described under The Eyes. Glass etching by means of the sandblast 
is described on page 417. 

Mineral Wool. Mineral wool is much used for packing around 
boilers and steam pipes and for deadening in building construction. 
It is made of very minute threads of glass and resembles, as its name 
indicates, sheep's wool. It is made by injecting steam under pressure 
into liquid blast furnace slag. The slag is thus blown into shreds 
which are collected in wire receptacles. In the process much irri- 
tant dust flies into the hair and faces of the workmen, and collects 
in the clothing and works into folds of the perspiring skin, causing 
itching and eczema. When inhaled the dust gives rise to irritant 
dry cough, and may cause pulmonary fibrosis. 



412 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Prevention. The raw material of glass, when being mixed, 
should be kept in covered receptacles as much as possible. The intro- 
duction of mechanical apparatus for glassblowing is doing much 
to mitigate the evils of this occupation when performed by mouth. 
Workmen should be examined by a physician and all who are actively 
syphilitic excluded. The excessive heat from the furnaces may be 
guarded against by the use of asbestos screens and forcible introduc- 
tion of a stream of cool air by means of a blow-fan and duct. The 
eyes should be protected from the light and heat of the ovens by 
blue and gray goggles, and face masks may be worn to protect the 
skin of the face from blistering. All grinding rooms should be 
thoroughly cleaned daily and dust removed from the wheels, tables 
and benches. The wheels should be encased as much as possible 
and a strong exhaust duct should be operated in connection with 
them. Women and children should be excluded from the more haz- 
ardous departments of work. When handling sharp-edged glass 
vessels, or working with lamp chimneys or thin bottles which are 
liable to explode, the hands should be protected from injury by stout 
leather gloves. 

The grinding or cutting of quartz, crystal and jet, jade and simi- 
lar substances presents the same hazards to the respiratory system 
as those of glass grinding. 

Mica. In the manufacture of mica goods considerable mica dust 
is found in the atmosphere. It is slightly irritating to the respi- 
ratory system, like dust containing any solid sharp particles, but 
does not appear to be particularly injurious. 

MEERSCHAUM 

Meerschaum, or sepiolite, is related to talc and soapstone in 
qualities. When being ground much fine dust is evolved which is 
very irritating to the lungs. It tends to produce fibroid phthisis 
and to maintain chronic bronchitis. (Fig. 71.) 

METAL FILINGS 

A very large proportion of the serious diseases of the lungs and 
bronchi are due to inhalation of filings of a great variety of metals,

but particularly of iron, steel and copper. These diseases are prin- 
cipally pneumonoconiosis, asthma and chronic bronchitis, with the 
frequent sequel of tuberculosis. The conditions under which, such 
dusts are formed are fully described under the separate metals caus-

ing them. The number of industries, too, in which metals are filed 
or ground and polished is very great. 



STONES AND EARTHS. CARBON 

The manufacture of grinding and polishing materials such as 
emery powder, corundum, glasspaper and sandpaper is productive 
of much fine, injurious dust. The fine dust from bricks, tiles, terra- 
cotta, marble, limestone, flint, granite, silica, etc., is developed in 
very many industries. All these dusts, if inhaled for long periods 
of time, tend to produce the same type of pulmonary lesion, namely, 
fibroid phthisis (described on page 33). They also cause conjunc- 
tivitis and traumatic injuries of the eyes (See Eyes). Among the 
workmen chiefly exposed to such hazards are stonecutters, rock 



414 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

drillers, and particularly those who use the sandblast for cleaning 
metal castings and making ground glass. (Fig. 72.) 

Stonecutters and quarrymen have been found in Germany to have 
a death rate of which 86 per cent, is due to pulmonary diseases. In 
Massachusetts, in statistics covering 16 years, it was shown that the 




FIG. 72. THE STONE INDUSTRY. "The workman is using a surfacing machine 
which is operated with compressed air. The strong blast of air keeps the 
granite clean, but gives rise to a great amount of dust, as shown in the 
picture. Of the mineral dusts granite is generally considered the most 
irritating." (Reproduced with permission of Dr. William C. Hanson, the 
Massachusetts State Board of Health, Aug., 1910.) 



deaths among stonecutters were due to tuberculosis in the ratio of 
41 per cent., and 12 per cent, were caused by other forms of pulmo- 
nary disease. 

Statistics of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, published 
in 1907, show that the mortality among stonecutters in Quincy, 
Massachusetts, from tuberculosis is 41 per cent., and that of all forms 
of pulmonary disease is 53 per cent. In general the tuberculosis 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 415 

mortality among stone and marble cutters and carvers is 5 times 
greater than among farmers or lumbermen. 

The drilling of rocks and coal or mineral veins for blasting is 
almost universally accomplished by machine drill-hammers, operated 
by compressed air or steam, which have replaced the slow method 
with the crowbar and hand-wielded sledge hammer. (See Fig. 61, 
page 391.) When this process is conducted by machines in mines, 
tunnel boring, or any kind of hard dry stone without the use of a 
water spray to moisten the dust, it is one of the most dangerous of all 
the trades which produce chronic disease. When the drilling is done 
overhead, so that the dust falls back toward the face of the machine 
operator the hazard is at its worst. 

J. S. Haldane, investigating the rock drillers of the Cornwall 
mines, found their average age at death was only 37 years, and that of 
-those who died 94 per cent, had pulmonary diseases. Their death 
rate exceeded that of coal miners by more than 10 to 1. 

The machine drills operate with such rapidity that the fine dust 
of the boring would choke the hole, and it is either removed by mak- 
ing the drill in screw form, like an augur for wood boring, or by 
blowing it out by compressed air, which is forced out at the tip of 
the drill. In the latter case, particularly, much irritant dust is dis- 
tributed in the surrounding air. It is not feasible always to pour 
water into the drill hole, for in mines especially the drills are set at 
all angles, and water interferes with the use of compressed air to 
remove the dust. Generally speaking, the harder the rock, the 
greater the damage by inhalation of dust to the respiratory organs, 
and conglomerate rock, owing to the large size of the dust particles, 
produces irritation like a sensation of scratching in the larynx. 

To lessen the dust hazard from the drill holes various expedients 
have been devised. The simplest of these is the placing of wet 
cloths around the drill hole to catch the dust and mopping up the 
dust, procedures which are troublesome and time-consuming. A 
recent invention consists of a pipe attached to the drill at the mouth 
of the bore through which a fine jet of water is forced under pressure 
into the drill hole, where it unites with the compressed air stream in 
mixing the dust into a harmless paste which flows back out of the 



416 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

hole. Another invention by Korfmann employs an exhaust pipe 
connected with the drill, by means of which the dust is drawn out 
of the hole, after the manner of a vacuum cleaner, and discharged 
into a vessel of water or a moist bag. These inventions have the ad- 
vantage that they operate independently of the workmen and do not

require precautions, which such workmen are notoriously reluctant to 
observe. 

Coal miners and shovelers who have been much exposed to coal 
dust (Fig. 73) always store considerable carbon in the lungs. Dr. 
Eisengraber (Ranch und Staub, Oct., 1911) has reported the 
pathological findings in such cases as follows : The lungs are mottled 
black, and their texture feels tough and leathery. From the cut sur- 
face a thick black mucus exudes. Here and there black nodules are 
found, which in extreme cases may be as large as an egg. The 
bronchial and mediastinal glands are infiltrated and contain much 
carbon. Fibrous pleurisy is common. Carbon may be found stored

in remote parts, as in the liver, where it has been conveyed by leu- 
kocytes. Those whose lungs are thus affected suffer from continu- 
ous hacking cough, with black-streaked sputum. They are dyspneic 
and short lived. 

A curious case of carbon tattooing is shown in the accompanying 
picture (Fig. 74) of the feet of a stoker who walked barefooted 





FIG. 74. TATTOOING OF THE FEET OF A STOKER WITH CARBON. The coal dust 
is deeply imbedded beneath the skin. (From a patient in Bellevue Hospital.) 

upon the heated, dust-covered grills in the stokehole of a steamer. 
The blackness of the feet is not due to superficial dirt, but to carbon 
particles deeply imbedded or "tattooed" beneath the skin. I have 
met with similar tattooing of the hands in coal heavers. 

Sandblasting. The sandblast is an apparatus constructed to blow 
a stream of sand by means of compressed air, with great force, against 
metal castings to clean them from the earth which adheres from the 
casting molds, and to smooth roughened surfaces. (Fig. 75.) It is 
also employed in cleaning stone and marble buildings and for the 
roughening of the surface of glass to make "ground glass/' and some- 
times to mark patterns upon glass, which is partially protected. Sand- 
blasting constitutes probably the most dangerous of all the mineral 
dust hazards, and it is impossible to engage in the work without pro- 



418 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

tection of the eyes and face, for the sharp particles of fine silicious 
sand are driven with such force against the objects operated upon 
that they rebound toward the workman, and, despite the use of long

is used. The cloudiness is due to excessive dust in the open shed. Men 
who do this kind of work, with the kind of helmet shown in the picture, are

dows, but fine wire netting shields the eyes, and cloths are inserted 
to breathe through. 

An important method of reducing the risk of dust from the 
sandblasting of metal castings is covered by a recent patent of C. 
Wedemeyer, of Hamburg. The operator stands in a cabinet direct- 
ing the sandblast away from himself toward the casting. (Fig. 76.) 
Over his head, at an angle 
of 45 degrees, a strong 
blower fan directs a stream 
of air also upon the casting 
with such force that the 
dust of both sand and 
metal is blown downward 
toward the opening of a 
large exhaust tube just 
above the floor. In this 
manner a strong, continu- 




ous draft blows the dust 
away from the operator 



FIG. 76. CABINET FOR SANDBLASTING IN- 
VENTED BY CHRISTIAN WEDEMEYER OP 
HAMBURG. The operator is enclosed in 
a cabinet in which he directs the blast of 
sand and compressed air against the cast- 
ing (b) in front. A strong air current is 
forced from directly above his head by 
the fan (t) and passes outward toward the 
revolving aspirating drum shown below 
the floor on the right. (From Rauch und 
Staub, ii, 5, Feb., 1912.) 



and out of the cabinet 
through the aspirator duct, 
which is connected with a 
powerful exhaust fan. 

Silica. Silica, or the 
siliceous earths, constitute a serious irritant to the respiratory pas- 
sages when ground into fine dust in the process of extracting the valu- 
able metals, such as tin, lead, gold, etc., with which they are com- 
bined. Continued inhalation of siliceous dust favors the production 
of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary fibrosis. The hard sharp dust 
particles irritate the conjunctivas and may become imbedded in the 
cornea. Ashmen are particularly liable to this form of dust irrita- 
tion. (See page 422.) 

An illustration of an occupational disease due to a heavy dust 
has lately come to my notice, occurring where one would least expect 
it, in a soap factory. A friend, while inspecting the factory, was 
seized with a violent fit of coughing, and he also noticed that the 



420 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

several hundred girls employed all had their hair protected by paper 
bags. The particular form of soap here manufactured was mixed 
with a finely powdered earth containing silica and the spicula of 
microscopic fossil animalcule. The operatives become used to the 
bronchial irritation and cease to cough, but unless the head is pro- 
tected the scalp becomes affected by disease, with dryness and intol- 
erable itching. 

B. SOLUBLE INORGANIC DUSTS 
SOLUBLE INORGANIC DUSTS IN GENERAL 

In this group there is a large number of substances which be- 
come more or less soluble in the presence of mucus, hydrochloric 
acid or other secretions of the alimentary canal. Examples are lime, 
gypsum, plaster of Paris/ phosphates, guano, and certain metals. 
The latter, chiefly, are injurious through solution and absorption. 

The dust of metal filings is not only inhaled in the nose, but is 
breathed into the mouth or taken into it with food, when such dusts 
as may be soluble, like that of lead or its salts, may produce specific 
toxic effects. The dusts of brass, arsenic, zinc, silver and salts of 
mercury are probably more injurious through being swallowed than 
inhaled. Their effects are fully described under the separate head- 
ings of the metals. 

OXALIC ACID 

This substance, occurring in the form of white crystals, is much 
used in solution for polishing copper, brass and other metals, in 
dyeing and chemical cleaning establishments, and in making straw 
hats and braiding. As a dust it irritates the respiratory organs, and 
as a fluid it acts upon the skin. Being a household agent for brass 
scouring, it is easily obtained and is occasionally swallowed with 
suicidal intent It causes intense cyanosis, a feeble pulse, paralyses, 
and sometimes convulsions. I have seen prolonged coma from its 
effects, lasting several days, but terminating in recovery. It disor- 
ganizes the blood, destroying the red cells. When swallowed it is 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 421 

highly corrosive in the esophagus and stomach. Acting in solution 
on the hands, it makes the nails hluish and brittle. 

Industrial poisoning from this substance is very rarely encount- 
ered. 

ULTRAMARIN 

Of this substance there are several varieties. Soda ultramarin 
is made by melting together in an oven kaolin, charcoal, soda and sul- 
phur. In other processes sulphuric acid is mixed with the raw 
material. The soda ultramarin is at first white, but on exposure to 
the air oxidizes to a deep blue color. 

The dust of the various substances used, which are finely ground, 
is both mechanically and chemically irritant by absorption to the 
respiratory passages, and the inhalation of sulphuric acid fumes 
from the furnaces is highly injurious. The workmen employed in 
packing the finished, finely powdered product suffer from nasal and 
bronchial catarrh, and Ropke found cases of erosion, ulceration and, 
in one instance, perforation of the catilaginous portion of the nasal 
septum. 

A serious case of conjunctivitis occurred in an Austrian work- 
man who in making ultramarin spattered a solution of sulphuric acid 
into his unprotected eyes. (Sozial Technik., 1912, vol. 4, No. 2.) 



C. ORGANIC DUSTS AND FIBERS 
ACRIDIN 

This substance is encountered in the use of certain organic dyes. 
It contains nitrogen as well as carbon and hydrogen. It forms color- 
less needle-shaped crystals which, blown about in. dust, are ex- 
cessively irritating to the skin and mucous membranes, causing vio- 
lent pruritus, redness and burning of the skin, conjunctivitis, rhi- 
nitis, continued sneezing and tracheitis. It affects the skin of the 
hands and arms of dyers. 



422 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 



ASHES AND STREET DUST 

Street Dust. Street dust is a highly complex form of respi- 
ratory irritant, containing many particles of both inorganic and 
organic matter distributed by winds and traffic, (a) The inorganic 
matter is derived (1) from the disintegration of the pavement sub- 
stance, which may be brick, granite, asphalt, macadam, flint rock, 
sand, earth, concrete, or other paving material; to this are added (2) 
scatterings from passing ashcarts, house sweepings, the dust from 
building operations, particles of iron rust, as from elevated railroads, 
soot, and dirt of street excavations often containing snlphids. (b) 
The organic material may be derived from wooden block pavements, 
tar used to cement stone blocks and fix gravel or sand in the inter- 
stices between them, the droppings of oil from automobiles, garbage, 
the powdered excrement of horses and dogs, sometimes human excre- 
ment from children in tenement districts, and the desiccated spu- 
tum expectorated by foot passengers. The latter evil is much miti- 
gated by the continued exposure to sunshine, air and dryness, which 
are inimical to the life of many germs. 

Street Cleaners and Ashcart Drivers. Owing to the dusty nature 
of the work of this type of workmen, they might be supposed to be 
especially liable to respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis 
and tuberculosis. Nevertheless, the open-air employment counter- 
balances this risk. A few years ago there was much popular dis- 
cussion in N/ew York over the alleged prevalence of tuberculosis 
among these men, and a thorough physical examination of the entire 
Street Cleaning Department force was made by Dr. John Rogers, 
Dr. A. Bleiman and other physicians. They found no more cases 
of tuberculosis among the sweepers and ashmen than the usual per- 
centage arising among any large group of workmen. Among 5,800 
men examined less than 2 per cent, gave evidence of incipient tuber- 
culosis and some had had the disease when they entered the depart- 
ment. In 1911 the number of cases was only 1 per cent.. Street- 
sweepers are liable to insolation when compelled to work for many 
consecutive days upon the heated asphalt pavements in strong sun- 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 423 

light in a hot, humid atmosphere, and, in 1911, there were 220 cases 
of heat prostration in 9 days among the 6,500 men of the depart- 
ment, including sweepers and drivers. 

It has been asserted that the collectors of ashes and garbage are 
very subject to hernia because they have the strain of lifting heavy 
barrels to the tops of the carts, which in many cases are 5 feet 9 
inches high. In 1911, among 2,695 men examined, there were only 
16 cases of rupture, or about 0.6 per cent., which is not above the 
average among any other group of workmen. Lumbago, ruptured 
tendons and sprains from strains and falls on slippery sidewalks are 
observed in about 0.5 per cent, of the workmen employed. 

Conjunctivitis and injuries to the eyes from sharp silica spicules 
or other forms of ash dust sometimes occur among the ashmen, but 
less often than might be supposed. 

CAKPET DUST 

Carpet cleaners are liable to inhale dust which is a mixture of 
all manner of dirt, with fibers from the carpet materials which often 
are dyed with more or less toxic pigments. No very serious ailments, 
however, appear to arise from the occupation, but germs of influenza, 
tuberculosis and those producing catarrhal inflammation may be in- 
haled, and the dust itself is mechanically irritant to the respiratory 
mucosa. 

COTTON 

Haw cotton contains much dirt of earth and sand, and in the 
ginning process the dirt, cotton seed fragments and cotton fibers are 
blown about so that the air is filled with irritant dust More or less 
respiratory irritation results. Epistaxis and nasal catarrh are com- 
mon and the employees complain of dryness of the nose and throat. 
Ropke examined 18 cleaners of raw cotton wool and found nearly all 
had small erosions of the nasal mucosa, which he attributes to the 
effect of sand and dirt. 

Cotton Spinning and Weaving. Cotton mills are usually large 
establishments employing several hundred operatives, many of whom 



424 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

are women and children. In the milling of cotton a number of dis- 
tinct processes are involved, nearly all of which are productive of 
much fiber dust. 

The baled cotton is first opened by men who place the material 
by armfuls in the "breakers." The next machine beats and cleans 
the cotton fibers and mixes them in thick layers or "laps." Another 
machine cards the fibers, i. e., works them into parallel strips. Thus 
far the work is principally conducted by men. Combing is the next 
process, conducted by women, whereby the fibers in the form of loose 
ropes are coiled in large cans. This is followed by passing through 
the drawing machine, whereby the cotton is drawn out into coarse 
strands. Roving strengthens the strands by twisting them on spools, 
which are then placed in the ring spinning machines. Women and 
girls also are employed in this process. In a further process, called 
"mule" spinning, considerable heat and moisture are necessary, so 
that the men and boys conducting it wear only one or two garments 
and perspire freely. The thread is now ready for weaving under 
regulated conditions of moisture and heat, which are necessary to 
prevent the threads becoming too dry and breaking. 

Hazards. Practically all the above described processes fill the 
air with fiber dust, so that even in the best ventilated- mills the 
operatives suffer in time from the dust and heat. The long hours of 
standing over machinery which constantly jars the floor, and which in 
some of the processes is very noisy, combine to favor ill health, with 
weakness, anemia, poor appetite and a tendency to bronchial catarrh 
and digestive disorders. In a study of the conditions of labor among 
1,500 operatives made in New Jersey in 1901 by William Stainsby 
the number of days lost from work in a year on account of ill health 
reached 3,762, and he groups the more important ailments as fol- 
lows: diseases of the lungs, 22 cases; of the throat, 15; kidneys, 
25 ; stomach and bowels, 31. The women also suffer much from 
dysmenorrhea, and any preexisting uterine disorder is liable to be 
made worse by the occupation. The death rate among the 1,500 
operatives was high, being 5.74 per cent. 

Another source of cotton dust exists in the polishing or buffing 
by means of rag wheels. In some cotton cloth and other cloth mills 



425 

the bolts of cloth are examined by girls who sit and draw the long 
strips of cloth constantly toward them, while searching for imper- 
fections in the weave. This process generates much fiber dust which 
flies toward the girls' faces and is inhaled. 

Symptoms. In general cotton and flax dust is more injurious 
than woolen mill dust. The weavers and spinners in the former 
industry suffer chiefly from tuberculosis, bronchitis, dyspepsia, 
rheumatism, varicose veins, and uterine disorders. Of these dis- 
eases bronchitis furnishes about one-third of all cases. Not all these 
diseases, by any means, are attributable directly to dust inhalation 
and poor general ventilation, but lack of home hygiene, poor food due 
to low wages, constrained positions and general fatigue and over- 
work must be considered in estimating the hazards. 

The bronchitis of cotton weavers is accompanied by a morning 
cough by which mucus is raised containing cotton fibers. The cotton 
fibers also are drawn down into the alveoli, which they tend to fill, 
causing emphysema and localized irritation and connective tissue 
increase. There is more or less dyspnea, and in time the patient 
becomes weak and anemic and loses appetite and weight. Hemopty- 
sis is not common from this form of dust. Bronchitis, peribronchi- 
tis and pneumonia may result. Promiscuous spitting on the floors 
by the operatives causes the dust of many germs to be added to the 
other impurities of the factory air. 

In the Southern United States "cotton-mill anemia" is fre- 
quently spoken of. C. W. Stiles, whose researches on uncinariasis 
are historic, has established the fact that mill employment has little 
or nothing to do with this condition, which is due rather to the low 
grade of workmen commonly employed, their wretched hygiene and 
uncinariasis derived from the soil-polluted farms from which the 
workers are largely recruited during the milling season. Cotton-fiber 
dust is, of course, an undesirable impurity in the air, causing more 
or less bronchial irritation as it does, but there is no special variety 
of mill worker's anemia other than that which naturally is conse- 
quent upon poor hygiene in general. 

In Lancashire in some years the deaths from tuberculosis of 
cotton weavers have risen as high as 20 per cent, of the total deaths 



426 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

from that disease, i. e., one man in five who died of tuberculosis 
was a weaver. In this ease, however, the dampness and high tem- 
perature purposely maintained in the weaving sheds to facilitate 
the weaving are doubtless contributing factors to the ill health of 
the operatives, who also often suffer from rheumatism. 

FEATHERS 

Workers in feathers and down of all sorts are subjected to 
various forms of irritation, chiefly of the respiratory passages. Not 
only do the feathers themselves give off fine dust, but they contain 
much general dust and dirt. In some cases poisonous dyestuffs are 
used, containing arsenical, chromate and other pigments. Some of 
the substances used in cleaning bed feathers etc., such as naphtha, 
may beget further specific irritation, and serious nasal and bron- 
chial catarrhs may result. In a feather establishment in New York 
State several cases of pulmonary abscess have occurred, the light 
feather dust from uncleaned feathers having served as a vehicle to 
convey septic germs into the lungs. 

FELT 

Felt is made from finely cut fur, from rabbit, hare and other 
skins, and to some extent from wool. The sorting and trimming 
of the fur, the cutting and other processes liberate many fine sharp 
hair dust particles which irritate the respiratory mucosa, causing 
sometimes catarrh of the nose and throat, with more or less bron- 
chial inflammation. The felt also is treated with mercurial nitrate, 
and subsequently, under high temperature, the mercury may be 
volatilized and inhaled, giving rise to mercurial poisoning. In the 
felt hat industry this problem is so important that it is separately 
considered on page 293. 

FLAX AND HEMP 

The dust from these two substances acts in substantially the 
same manner. Being volatile, it is easily inhaled, and is often 



IRRITANT DUSTS AtfD FIBERS 427 

mixed with natural dirt, oil from machinery, and the vapors or 
fumes of chemical processes used in bleaching or macerating the 
vegetable fibers. The stems of the plants are first submitted to a 
process of beating and subsequent macerating to separate the in- 
dividual fibers. They are treated in closed vats containing a watery 
solution of sulphuric acid, and the workmen are liable to inhale 
fumes of this acid, of ammoniated sulphur, and other respiratory 
irritants. The process of beating out the fibers liberates a great 
deal of dust of sharp pointed plant cells, dirt, etc. 

The flax and hemp beaters suffer from a so-called "beater's 
fever," resembling ague, with malaise, headache, neuralgia and 
acute catarrh of the upper air passages. The patients may suffer 
from nosebleed, loss of sense of smell, dryness of the nasal and 
pharyngeal mucosa. Chronic otitis media is also common among 
them, as well as eczema of the hands and arms. 

In a chronic condition of poisoning among these workmen, de- 
scribed by French writers, additional symptoms may be observed, 
such as brown pigmentation of the skin, dullness, an uncertain gait, 
and curious odor of hasheesh in the urine. 

Among 12 flax carders, Ropke found 3 with atrophic rhinitis 
and pharyngitis, and among 20 women flax spinners 9 had catarrhal 
affections of the nose and throat. 

The threads are spun several times, and in the final process, being 
drawn very fine, they are kept moist so there is no more dust, but 
the spinning rooms are necessarily kept moist and warm. 

The Prussian factory laws restrict the maximum of dust al- 
lowed in flax mills to 8 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air, 
measured at the level of the operator's head. 

Hemp as it is fed into breakers, preparatory to spinning into 
cord or twine, or weaving into gunny cloth, gives off large quantities 
of coarse dust fibers. In Massachusetts, where much of these ma- 
terials are made, the operatives fasten bunches of fiber over the 
mouth and nose to act as sieves for the dust. 

Automatic machine hacklers for breaking and binding the flax 
fibers are gradually replacing the dusty hand methods of this in- 
dustry. 



428 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

FUR 

The sorting, cleaning and dressing of furs is a dusty occupa- 
tion which, like working in feathers, may give rise to chronic bron- 
chitis. (Fig. 77.) In exceptional cases the fur particles convey 
septic germs to the lungs and pulmonary abscess may occur. Fur-

riers are very susceptible to tuberculosis. Some of the dyestuffs 
used in fur manufacture may give rise to eczema and other forms 
of cutaneous irritation. One of my cases was that of a man 28 
years of age, who for 10 years had been employed in cleaning and 
cutting fur. On examination he presented a bronchiectatic cavity, 
extremely fetid expectoration, and tuberculosis, with fever and ane- 
mia. Lime, sulphid of arsenic and nitrate of mercury are among 
the deleterious substances used for "curing" in various stages of 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 429 

manufacture of furs and fur materials, such as felt. (See Felt 
Hats, page 289.) 

Six cases of eczema impetiginosum occurred in a felt hat factory 
in New Jersey early in 1914 from handling infected fur. One of 
the patients whom I examined had had the eruption for eight weeks. 
It began behind the ears, spread to the scalp, and seriously involved 
the hands, arms, legs, thighs and scrotum. The victim suffered from 
intolerable burning and itching of the skin. The blebs became 
purulent and sanguineous and superficial ulcers formed with areolas 
of dermatitis. Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus was isolated from 
the pus. The man finally was obliged to give up work and seek 
hospital relief, where he improved under vaccine treatment. In 
a second case which I saw the eruption did not spread beyond the 
hands and arms, for the man quit his work after two or three weeks, 
becoming alarmed by the persistence of the eruption. 

In the process of felt hat making, where the rabbit or other fur 
in a fine state of subdivision is blown upon perforated copper cones 
enclosed in large wooden drums, the workman, unless the drums be 
closed before the fur is blown upon the cones, receives the fine fur 
dust in his face and necessarily inhales more or less of it with re- 
sulting bronchial irritation. 

Five cases of dermatitis acquired by furriers from the use of 
dyes were reported within a few months' time to the New York 
State Labor Bureau in 1912. 

GKAIN AND FLOUR 

Millers and those who handle grain and flour are subjected to 
dust inhalation. The flour dust particles are soft and do not pro- 
duce much irritation, but those who hammer the lids on flour barrels 
or sack the flour may suffer from nasal catarrh. The chaff of the 
various grains is harder. Mingled with it, in threshing, may be 
dirt from the fields and dust particles derived from the grinding 
wheels and polishing rollers. Such dust may amount to one per 
cent, of the grain. (Fig. 78.) 

Millers of grain and grain elevator men suffer considerably from 



430 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

pulmonary diseases, of which Hirt's statistics give 20.3 per cent, 
pneumonia, 10.3 per cent, tuberculosis, 9.3 per cent, bronchitis, and 
1.9 per cent, emphysema. Others state that tuberculosis causes 20

per cent, among all causes of death among millers, or a ratio of one 
in five. 

Dr. F. L. Hoffman states that "the continual and considerable 
inhalation of flour dust is injurious to health and a predisposing 
factor in the mortality from consumption and from respiratory dis- 
eases generally." 

Millers and grain handlers acquire catarrhs of the nose and 
throat and bronchi, and may have epistaxis, sneezing, rhinitis and 
dry cough. Those employed in the grain-polishing rooms are espe- 
cially liable to these complaints. 

Flour and meal dust, when breathed into the nose in quantity, 
adhere, when moistened with mucus, to the mucosa in thick crusts, 
which may give rise to ulceration and atrophic rhinitis. Otitis 



IEEITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 431 

media may result from the nasal catarrh. The dust also enters the 
external ear, and with the ear wax may become packed against the 
tympanum, or give rise to eczema and furunculosis of the external 
auditory canal. Deafness in moderate degree may be caused by 
the noise of the grinding machinery. 

Flour and meal dust may cake in the smaller bronchi, forming 
obstructive plugs and causing atelectasis. Emphysema is met with 
and "miller's asthma" is a disease well recognized by the workmen. 
In the sputum the irritant epidermic layers of grain are found. 
Oats are the most irritant of the grains. Up to 30 years ago much 
siliceous dust was derived from the grindstones, which added to the 
above-mentioned hazards, but steel rollers have now replaced them 
in the larger mills, and much of the handling of grain is accom- 
plished by enclosed machinery. Cleaning the returned empty grain 
sacks is a very dusty occupation. 

Millers show a high death rate from pneumonia, it being more 
than double the ordinary rate in other occupations, according to the 
Report of the ISTew York State Bureau of Labor for 1906. 

A further menace to grain elevator workers and workers in 
starch mills consists in the occasional explosion of the dust. In a 
plant in Illinois 4 men recently were killed in this manner, and in 
June, 1913, an explosion of dust in a grain elevator in Buffalo 
caused the death or serious injury by burning of several scores of 
persons. 

HORN, BONE AND SHELL: CELLULOID COMBS 

In addition to the use of these substances in button manufac- 
ture (See Button Making), they are ground and polished to make 
knife handles, combs and a great variety of articles of use and orna- 
ment, and the dust is more or less irritating to the respiratory pas- 
sages. Combs and hair pins are made also of horn, bone, shell, 
tortoise shell, celluloid (Fig. 79), metal and composition. Leo- 
minster, Massachusetts, is a great center for this industry. In 
polishing such articles a wheel is sometimes used, powdered with 
fine coal ashes, and both moisture and dust in excess may be gener- 
ated. The combs are bent on hot asbestos-covered steel tables, and 



432 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

camphor, an ingredient of celluloid, may be liberated as a vapor. 
The pins are smoothed with wet pumice stone. In this form of 
manufacture, also, the articles are dipped into glacial acetic acid, 




FIG. 79. POINTING THE TEETH OF CELLULOID COMBS. "Sand wheels or steel 
burrs are used. The exhaust system in this case is quite as much for pro- 
tection against fire as to prevent the inhalation of the dust." (Reproduced

Health, Aug., 1910.) 

which gives rise to eczema of the hands, and the fumes of which are 
irritating to the eyes and bronchi, although somewhat less so than 
are those of the mineral acids. 



HORSEHAIR AND OTHER HAIR 

Horsehair is much used in upholstery, and in its handling gives 
rise to unclean dust of fine hairs, particles of dried epithelium, and 
sometimes of flesh. (Fig. 80.) Arens inoculated rabbits with this 
dust, and from the pustules which developed obtained cultures of 
the Bacillus pyogenes fetidus and Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus- 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 



433 



Upholsterers, brush and paint-brush makers sometimes suffer 
from pustules and carbuncle. In the latter industries hair and 
bristles from a variety of different animals are used. Hair is 




FIG. 80. HORSEHAIR CARDING MACHINE. (From Shaw Lecture by Dr. J. S. 
Haldane on "Dust and Fumes in Factories," Royal Society of Arts, London, 
Feb. 28, 1908.) 

employed also in rotating polishing wheels used in burnishing 
various metals, and more or less hair dust is given off in the 
process. 

Hair dust irritates the nasal mucosa and may give rise to sneez- 
ing, epistaxis, ulceration and catarrh, as well as to asthmatic at- 
tacks. Some few persons are peculiarly sensitive to horsehair dust, 
that they acquire attacks of "hay fever" from inhaling mere traces 



434 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

of it, as in driving behind a horse. Exceptionally, polypoid degen- 
eration of the nose has resulted from hair dust inhalation. 

The hazard of working in hair is very variable. One of my 
cases was that of a workman who, as a boy of 10 years, began pick- 
ing and sorting hair, and for 35 years had been occupied upholster- 
ing furniture with hair. He had never had any pulmonary or other 
symptoms referable to his occupation. Another patient had worked 
for 22 years at the same occupation. While at work he frequently 
had a cough, as did many of his 75 fellow workmen. He had had 
recurrent attacks of bronchitis for 15 years and finally acquired 
tuberculosis, with pneumothorax. 

In addition to horsehair, upholsterers make use of a variety of 
more or less dusty materials, such as oakum, excelsior, moss, sea- 
weed, a coarse grass known as "Mexican fiber," etc., but none of these 
substances possess any specific qualities of irritation. 

Prevention. Bales of imported goat or camel hair and the like 
should be opened for sorting either only after wetting or placing 
over a large wire screen with an exhaust beneath, so that all infected 
dust may be drawn away from the workman. The walls of the 
workroom should be limewashed several times a year to cleanse and 
disinfect them. 

JUTE 

Nature of the Industry. The processes of jute manufacture for 
cord, rope, coarse cloth, such as burlap, etc., are complicated and 
exceedingly dusty throughout. Jute is the inner bark fiber of several 
species of Corehorus which grow in India and South America. The 
fiber is stripped from the main stems by hand, moistened, dried, and 
under hydraulic presses made into compact bales for transportation. 
On opening the bales for manufacture, the fibers are laid lengthwise 
in bundles, a process conducted originally by hand, but now to a 
great extent by special machinery. The fibers are sorted, the shorter 
ones being discarded and dirt and impurities removed. They are 
then flattened by running between pairs of rollers and pounded. 
They are next moistened with sprays of water and oil to limber 
them. Several processes of carding and spinning follow, and the 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 



435 



fibers are thus finally twisted and drawn into threads, from which 
they may be made into cord, rope (Fig. 81), or spun into coarse 
sacking. The entire handling of the jute is exceedingly dusty 




FIG. 81. JUTE ROPE MAKING. A very dusty occupation in a room without 

ventilation. 



work, especially opening the bales and feeding the rollers, and the 
dust is of a particularly irritant kind, owing to the peculiar struc- 
ture of the fiber and the dirt which it at first entangles. 

Symptoms. Jute dust is irritating to the eyes, skin, hair and 
lungs. It gives rise to conjunctivitis and causes itching and eczema 
of the unprotected scalp. It causes, also, bronchitis, rhinitis and 
asthma. In chronic jute poisoning, according to Oscar Gerold, of 
Berlin, there are anemia, weakness and emaciation, with sometimes 
suddenly appearing fulminating pains in the legs, with softening of 
the long bones. 

Jute spinning begets much coarse dust, so that the nasal cavities 
become -almost filled with it. Among 15 spinners examined by 



436 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

Ropke, more or less atrophy of the nasal mucosa was present in all, 
they having been employed two or more years. In several cases 
polypoid degeneration was observed. 




FIG. 82. DUST REMOVAL PLANT IN A JUTE SPINNING MILL. The 
jute fibers are sorted on the inclined perforated planes through which 
dust is aspirated downward. Other aspirating ducts remove the dust from 
above, connecting with the hoods. 



In making jute twine and bags the dust mingling with the natural 
wax of the ears packs into hard cakes, which lie against the tym- 
panum, causing temporary deafness. 

Among 44 jute spinners Ropke found 6 cases of eczema of the 
hands and forearms. There were also cases of eczema of the ears 
and ala3 nasi. Hiiberden found several cases of furunculosis among 
this type of workmen. 

Those employed in making tarred hempen ropes may acquire 
eczema from irritation by the tar. 

Prevention. Much of the jute work formerly conducted by 
hand is now performed by machinery, protected by exhaust ducts 
placed both directly over the machines and, covered by gratings 
beneath the machines, just above the floor. (Fig. 82.) The hair 



IRKITANT DUSTS AND FIBEKS

should be protected by linen caps, and overalls and goggles should 
be worn in the more dusty divisions of the work. Asthmatic at- 
tacks demand a change of work, at least temporarily. 

RAGS AND PAPER 

Paper is made from a variety of substances in this country, such 
as old rags, old paper, wood pulp and burlap. The rags are mainly 
imported in bales from Eastern countries, and are disinfected before 




FIG. 83. PAPER MAKING. Removing dust from the rag-sorting room by means 
of metal exhaust ducts connected with a centrifugal fan. (From Shaw 
Lecture by Dr. J. S. Haldane, on "Dust and Fumes in Factories," Royal 
Society of Arts, London, Feb. 28, 1908.) 



import, but they are still very dirty, and in the thrashing and chop- 
ping machines in which they are disintegrated great quantities of 
dust are stirred up. In parts of the work where the dust is thickest 
the operatives wear respirators. 



438 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

In rag sorting (Fig. 83) for paper making there is danger of 
infection with a variety of diseases ; for, apart from the dust of the 
material, the dirty rags may have been used by those having con- 
tagious diseases, although rags imported from oriental countries 
where smallpox, cholera and typhus fever are often prevalent are 
always disinfected, and in this country such infections are no v longer 
transmitted in this manner. 

Offelmann, in a study of 4,875 employees in this industry, de- 
clared that one-half at least become ill during the year in one way 
or another, and about one-third of them acquire diseases of the 
respiratory system. The so-called "wool sorter's disease," or actino- 
mycosis, has exceptionally, in foreign countries, been transmitted by 
rag-sorting. Eberhardt collected 40 fatal cases which occurred in 
Germany in 17 years; and Dohnal, 13 cases in 5 years; but such 
cases are extremely rare at this time and in this country, owing to 
the efficiency of modern quarantine disinfection, are virtually 
unknown. In some cases the dust of baled rags reaches 20 or 
30 per cent, of the weight of the rags. Its inhalation may give 
rise to acute and chronic bronchitis, bronchorrhea and gastric 
catarrh. 

In the process of macerating and bleaching the rags, hydro- 
chloric and sulphuric acids are sometimes used, as well as chlorid 
of lime, all of which substances give rise to fumes which are more or 
less irritant to the respiratory passages, although their strength is 
usually not sufficient to produce very harmful effects. Parts of the 
paper-making process are very wet (Fig. 84), and the workman 
may be obliged to stand all day exposed to dampness or complete 
wetting. The rags are also boiled or treated with steam, which con- 
tributes to the dampness of the trade. 

In the manufacture of wall papers and other colored paper a 
variety of pigments are used. For the production of green shades 
arsenic was formerly much used, but, owing to the danger of arseni- 
cal poisoning, not only in the process of manufacture, but from 
arsenical dust or vapor which might be given off after the wall paper 
was hung, lead chromate and other lead pigments and anilin colors 
have been substituted almost universally. It is probable, however, 






IERITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 



439 



that the danger of acquiring arsenical neuritis in sleeping apart- 
ments freshly hung with green arsenic-colored paper has been greatly 
exaggerated. 

Chrome poisoning occasionally occurs among the paper makers 
who handle this pigment Cases of bronze poisoning have also been 
recorded in this industry. In making velour tapestry papers much

adequate protection. 



irritating fine wool dust is given off. The hazards of making sand- 
paper, emery paper, glass sandpaper, etc., are described under the 
uses of these materials. 

In the making of cellulose or wood pulp paper various processes 
are employed in which either sodium hydroxid or calcium sulphate 
may be added to the finely cut wood fiber, which is boiled with these 
materials under pressure in closed vats. There is opportunity for 
liberation of sulphurous acid and consequent irritation of the bron- 
chial mucosa. (See page 375.) New workmen in the process are 



440 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

liable to complain of rhinitis and cough, but they soon become inured 
to the irritation (Lehmann). 

STEAW AND BKOOM 

Workers in straw, such as straw hat makers, inhale more or less 
dust composed of the straw itself and dirt. In making straw hats 




FIG. 85. BROOM DUST. 



sulphuric acid is used for bleaching, and solutions of lead salts, such 
as lead chromate, are used as coloring agents. The dust and acid 
fumes may give rise to catarrh of the respiratory passages, and the 
dyestuffs may cause eczema. 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 441 

Broom and brush makers inhale much dust (Fig. 85), and 
brushes made from hog bristles give rise to sharp particles of animal 
dust. Hirt's German statistics show that among the deaths of those 

employed in this industry about one-half are caused by tuberculosis. 



SUGAR 

In sugar refineries considerable dust of charcoal and sugar is 
liberated in the processes of cutting the sugar into cubes or pulveriz- 
ing it to powdered sugar. 

Dr. George M. Price, Director of the New York State Factory 
Investigating Commission, made the following statement in 1911 
(Proceedings Acad. Political Sci., New York, Jan., 1912, vol. ii, 
No. 2) : "In a large sugar refinery which I recently inspected I 
found the sanitary conditions as to care, comforts and toilet accom- 
modations much lower than in any ordinary garment shop which I 
had inspected during the last year. On several floors of this huge 
nine-story double building I found the air so filled with charcoal 
dust that it was impossible to see four feet away, and impossible 
to breathe longer than a few minutes. On one of the floors of this 
refinery I found a dozen persons, barefooted, and naked except for 
a loin cloth, in a temperature of 95 F., with a relative humidity of 
96, almost reaching saturation, rinsing and washing dirty filter- 
bags in half a dozen vats, the water in which was at 130 F. The 
whole place resembled nothing so much as a scene from Dante's 
Inferno" 

Symptoms. Sugar refiners are subject to several varieties of 
skin disorder. They are exposed to heat and moisture, and the 
residue of molasses contains dirt and may harbor germs and mites. 
Thus the refiners and molasses stirrers may acquire a lymphangitis 
due to the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus (Gaillot), which often 
develops a furunculosis. They also may have dermatitis involving 
both upper and lower extremities. Formerly, when coarse brown 
sugar was much in use, much was said of a so-called "grocer's itch," 
believed to be due to a parasitic mite. The dermatitis above re- 
ferred to may resemble impetiginous scabies. A similar mite is 



442 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

said to find its habitat also in flour, and hence to affect bakers with 
dermatitis. 

TOBACCO 

The handling of tobacco on a large scale involves much sub- 
division of labor. The leaves are dried where they are picked, 
packed for shipment, unpacked from hogsheads, dusted free from 




FIG. 86. TOBACCO SORTING. 

sand, etc., and moistened. These processes develop either tobacco 
dust (Fig. 86) or tobacco vapor. The vapor develops in the drying 
sheds, during the six months of fermentation, and the dust arises 
in the warehouses where packing and unpacking are done, and where 
tobacco is ground, as for snuff, cigarettes or for pipe smoking or 
chewing. In one part of the process the tobacco is steamed and 
dried on heated trays. Finally the sorting of cigars and packing 
them in boxes is a dusty process, and the paste used for cigar ring 
labels is made of starch and tobacco juice. 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 443 

About 40 per cent, of cigar makers are females, and about 60 
per cent, of those employed with cigarette machines also. Many 
young girls are employed in the tobacco industry, especially for 
rolling, packing and labeling cigars, and their nervous systems are 
quite susceptible to tobacco poisoning. In some tobacco factories 
the operatives are permitted to bite off the ends ctf the filler and 
inner wrappers. 

Sommerfeld found that in Berlin the mortality from tubercu- 
losis among tobacco workers was nearly double that of workers in 
non-dusty trades. In the United States, in 1905, in the Cigar 
Makers' Union, 24 per cent, of recorded deaths were due to tuber- 
culosis. 

The quantity of nicotin in tobacco varies from 2 to 3 per cent, 
in the lower grades to 6 or 7 per cent, in the higher. The exact com- 
position of the volatilized substances given off by moistened and 
fermenting tobacco is not accurately known, but -it appears to have 
similar toxic effect to tobacco dust. Ammonia is one of the in- 
gredients. Both the dust and the vapor, on entering the respiratory 
passages, act as mild local irritants, and absorption also takes place, 
by which nicotin may enter the blood and give rise to constitutional 
reactions manifested chiefly through the circulation (increasing ar- 
terial tension) and nervous systems, but to some extent, also, in the 
alimentary canal. 

Symptoms. Tobacco workers are more liable to toxic symptoms 
in the first weeks of their employment, but may be affected at any 
time under unfavorable conditions. In countries such as France, 
where children and young girls are much employed in the industry, 
sometimes more than 50 per cent, are made ill during the first six 
months of their work, and such children may remain ill for several 
days. They suffer from cerebral congestion, insomnia, muscular 
weakness and nervousness, as well as palpitation of the heart, pharyn- 
gitis, cough, gastro-intestinal disorders, such as nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea. They also have conjunctivitis. Later they may become 
anemic, owing to continued gastric disorder and insufficient secretion, 
and eventually become emaciated if not removed from their work. 
Adults exposed either to tobacco fumes or dust present symptoms 



444 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

quite similar to those which arise from smoking too much tobacco 
in an ill-ventilated room. They complain of headache, faintness, 
vertigo, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea may be present, due to 
increased peristalsis. If the worker does not leave the factory, at- 
tacks of tachycardia and anemia result. Visual disturbances such 
as amblyopia may appear. With the latter there is pallor of the 
optic nerve and sometimes central scotoma for red and green. 

These various symptoms are much more common among females 
than males, and especially affect beginners in the work. In the mak- 
ing of snuff attacks of coryza, lacrimation, conjunctivitis and bron- 
chitis- are liable to affect novices. Women workers in tobacco fac- 
tories often suffer from dysmenorrhea, and abortions are frequent 
among the married women. Ruef and Stolz claim to have found 
traces of nicotin in amniotic fluid, and Kostial found it in the breast 
milk of a nursing woman. Etienne, of Nancy, followed the histories 
of 93 pregnant women tobacco workers. Eight of them were de- 
livered of still-born infants, and in those instances in which the 
mothers returned to work after parturition, but attempted still to 
suckle their young, the infant mortality was double that of children 
whose mothers were not connected with tobacco works. Pierracini, 
of Milan, reported similar results in 1905, and found 45 per cent, 
of premature deliveries among tobacco-working mothers. It is pos- 
sible, however, that these fatalities were due to other conditions than 
the influence of tobacco or to exceptionally bad hygiene, for, on the 
contrary, a research among 17,000 tobacco employees reported in 
the "Traite d'hygiene industrielle," vol. vii, page 525, shows 
that morbidity and mortality are not above the average among 
the newborn children of tobacco workers. In the French tobacco 
factories a system of infant inspection has been instituted for sev- 
eral years, which is no doubt largely responsible for the favorable 
statistics. Each month the mother takes her infant to the physician 
employed by the factory company, and he examines it and gives all 
necessary directions as to feeding, etc. These opposite statistical 
results illustrate the importance of accuracy in gathering data upon 
questions of hygiene which may be influenced by such extraneous 
factors as alcoholism, syphilis, a desire to avoid having children, etc. 






IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 445 

In the United States married women are less employed in tobacco 
factories than they are in France and Italy and other foreign coun- 
tries, and statistical data regarding them here are lacking, but it is 
safe to assert that the occupation is not rated as especially hazard- 
ous either for themselves or their offspring, or the matter would have 
attracted special attention. In the lungs of tobacco workers patches 
of pigment and brown induration have been found. 

Treatment. The treatment of tobacco poisoning is purely symp- 
tomatic, for the symptoms promptly subside under cessation of work 
or improved ventilation, and no permanent results ensue in any case. 

WOOD 

Wood workers are subject to a variety of disease hazards. Apart 
from the irritation to the air passages of inhaling fine particles of 
sawdust, which are less injurious than many other forms of dust, 
the finer grades of tropical woods, used in cabinet making, 
veneers, etc., sometimes contain poisons such as alkaloids and other 
substances. Belonging to this class are the African rosewood, satin- 
wood, teakwood and redwood, sequoia, boxwood, ebony and many 
others. 

In the manufacture of furniture, interior structural woodwork, 
etc., coloring and polishing materials are used, and wax, oil of tur- 
pentine, shellac dissolved in wood alcohol or benzene. Various pig- 
ments are either dissolved in these substances or separately rubbed 
into the wood, but lead pigments are not often used for this purpose. 
Sandpaper and emery paper are also used to produce a smooth 
finish, and when this work is done in a confined space, as in the 
interior veneering work in a Pullman car, much injurious dust is 
set free. The scraping of hardwood floors is a very dusty occupa- 
tion, and when the floors being cleaned are old the dust may 
contain oils, resin, and pigments. Sternberg, of Vienna, describes 
typical deformities of the chest which are sometimes met with in 
wood polishers and cabinet-makers who stand in constrained attitudes 
over work benches. The shoulder muscles are well developed, the 
clavicles are prominent and elevated, and the thorax is flattened 



446 DISEASES DUE TO IEEITANT SUBSTANCES 

anteriorly. Flat-foot and varicose veins in the legs are common, 
sometimes with eczema. A very curious condition, also described 
hy Sternberg, has been observed in polish " drinkers. The shellac 
solution is drunk for the alcohol which it contains, and the shellac 
gradually coats the stomach, finally rolling up into a ball which fails 
to pass through the stomach, and in extreme cases has been recog- 
nized, he asserts, as a tumor requiring operation for its removal! 

Workmen employed in laying parquet floors frequently acquire 
bursitis at the patella. Wood polish irritates the hands, often caus- 
ing chronic eczema. 

The most frequent illnesses among wood workers, however, are 
affections of the respiratory organs due to the wood dust and the 
various substances above mentioned which become mingled with it. 
The fumes of turpentine, benzene and wood alcohol may give rise 
to acute poisoning, affecting also the circulation (as described under 
these several headings). 

E. J. ISTeisser found in a Swiss wooden tool factory that three- 
fourths of the workmen became ill during the year, mainly from 
diseases of the respiratory system. 

According to Sternberg, among 10,071 wood workers in Vienna 
in 1904 there were 28.1 per cent, who suffered from tuberculosis 
and other diseases of the respiratory system. Rhinitis and middle 
ear catarrh, bronchitis and asthma are common among this class of 
workmen. Where noisy sawmills and planing machines are used, 
more or less deafness and sometimes disease of the auditory nerves 
may result. 

Canes and umbrella sticks are often colored with chrome pig- 
ments, and Blum has seen typical chrome poisoning with ulceration 
of the nasal septum (See page 182) among workmen employed in 
their production. 

Boxwood is used chiefly for manufacturing rulers and shuttles. 
The fine sawdust from this wood is quite harmful when inhaled. 
Men employed in boxwood manufacture for the first time are liable 
to pain and smarting in the eyes, dizziness, symptoms resembling 
severe influenza and bronchial catarrh. Later, if they persevere in 
the work, they may become pale and jaundiced and suffer from 



IRRITANT DUSTS AND FIBERS 447 

asthma and cold sweats. The heart action becomes markedly slow, 
and an alkaloid has been obtained from the wood, which, when given 
experimentally to animals, causes depression of the heart and general 
muscular weakness. The wood of the California sequoia has similar 
properties. 

In this connection, a man who deals in fancy woods used for 
veneering told me an amusing incident. A new wood called "Ton- 
quin" was received from an East Indian island for trial in the mills. 
On being sawed into thin slabs it gave off a most unusual quantity 
of bright red sawdust which covered the workmen. One of them, 
thinking to wash the dust from his hair, dipped his head in a bucket 
of water, when, to his surprise, the hair turned a bright grass-green 
color. It took him several days of scrubbing to restore the natural 
color ! 

Cokus wood contains an irritant oil which may give rise to a 
papular eczema of the lips and ears and sometimes may involve 
almost the entire face. 

"Coca-bola" is a very hard imported wood used in Massachu- 
setts for making handles for agricultural implements. Its dust is so 
irritating to the eyes and skin, causing conjunctivitis and dermatitis, 
that some workmen after trial are compelled to give up working in 
the wood. 

Satinwood (Chloraxylon Swietenii) may give rise to urticarial 
edema of the hands. Indian rosewood produces similar irritation, 
which may involve the face. 

Others of the woods giving rise to resinous dust, such as ebony 
and teak, may cause dermatitis in sawyers. Erythema multiforme 
and pustular acne-form eruptions are also observed. 

A Japanese wood called "Tagayasa" is much used in making 
fine furniture on account of its hardness, fine appearance and prop- 
erty of polishing well. When pulverized by sandpapering, sawing, 
etc., it gives rise to a dark brown or violet-colored powder which is 
highly irritant to the eyes and skin. It causes intense conjunctivitis 
and begets a dermatitis of the hands, breast and face of the work- 
man which results in punctate dark brown discoloration, looking 
somewhat like gunpowder pigmentation. The powdered wood con- 



448 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

tains a substance chemically allied to chrysarobin, the irritant action 
of which upon the skin is well known in medicine. Dr. Iwakawa, 
of Tokio, has experimented with this toxic wood chemically and 
upon animals, and found that it produced, like chrysarobinic acid, 
serious disturbance of the renal and digestive functions. Prevention 
of the hazard consists in wearing goggles and gloves and observing 
strict cleanliness. 

Teakwood contains an irritant resin. When this wood is finely 
pulverized its dust, inhaled or swallowed, may give rise to nausea, 
vomiting and other constitutional symptoms. Locally it produces 
a severe generalized and very persistent dermatitis which may not 
be relieved for many weeks, meanwhile giving rise to much burning 
and itching. 

Cork is not only cut for matting, corks, etc., but ground to fine 
sawdust and mixed with gypsum and acid it is used for patent wood 
flooring. It is also ground for linoleum making and a variety of 
other purposes. 

WOOL 

The sorting and cleaning of wool is a very dusty occupation, for 
the wool is oily and contains considerable extraneous dirt. From 
wool imported from oriental countries the germ infection known as 
"wool-sorter's disease" or anthrax is sometimes acquired, although 
very rarely in this country. It is described on page 452. I have 
known of two or three cases of anthrax which occurred among 
weavers of woolen rugs and carpets in factories in eastern New York 
State. They handled wool which had not previously been disinfected 
thoroughly. Wool-sorters often suffer from both acute and chronic 
catarrh of the air passages. In extracting the natural oil from the 
wool sulphur carbonyl is employed, which is highly toxic if inhaled 
as a vapor. After washing the wool any remaining particles of dirt 
or vegetable fibers are removed by hydrochloric or sulphuric acid 
solutions. This process is conducted in closed vats or large drums, 
which, when opened, may give forth acid fumes that are irritating. 
The process of wool carding and spinning is less dusty than those 
of cotton, flax and jute. 



GERMS 449 



V. GERMS 

ANKYLOSTOMIASIS OR UNCINARIASIS: HOOKWORM 

DISEASE 

The arikylostoma duodenale or uncinaria duodenalis is a para- 
site of wide foreign distribution, belonging to the Strongyloides 
family, which inhabits the small intestine of man, as the name indi- 
cates. Another species, the uncinaria americana (Stiles), appears 
to be indigenous in the United States. The female parasite is 18 
mm. in length, the male about 10 mm. The American species is 
somewhat shorter. The males possess a terminal fringed bursa at 
one extremity of the worklike body, known as the "bursa copulatrix," 
used to grasp the female in copulation. At the other extremity is a 
wide mouth with four strong upper hooks or teeth wherewith the 
parasite holds fast to the intestinal wall. At the lower margin of 
the mouth are two smaller rounded teeth. Further back in the 
mouth are two more small teeth which serve to bite open blood ves- 
sels in the mucosa. On the head also are two large glands of unde- 
cided function, but which are believed by some to secrete a sub- 
stance which is toxic to the human blood. Another theory is that 
their secretion has the function of preventing coagulation of the 
blood upon which the parasite feeds. It is believed to survive for 
years in the intestine, periodically discharging oval segmented eggs, 
which, being aerobic, must develop outside of the human body under- 
favorable conditions of warmth and moisture such as exist in unhy- 
gienic mines. Here, in a few days the larva develop, attaining a 
length of 0.8 mm. They become encapsulated, in which condition 
they have been kept alive experimentally fully a year. If conveyed 
by man to the mouth and swallowed, the capsule dissolves and in 
5 or 6 weeks the larva completes its growth to a full-sized egg- 
producing intestinal worm. The larvae have been experimentally 
proved by fully a dozen observers to have the power of boring into 
the human skin and entering the blood and lymph channels, but it 
is probable that oral transmission is the usual mode of infection in 



450 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

mines where hundreds of workmen defecate daily and pollute the 
soil. 

The anemia which is so pronounced a symptom of this disease 
was formerly known as "Miner's anemia" and "Egyptian chlorosis," 
being of mysterious nature until it was traced to the ankylostoma 
duodenale, the European species of the parasite. In foreign mines 
the disease was at one time so prevalent as to assume epidemic pro- 
portions, as happened during the construction of the St. Gothard tun- 
nel. In Germany, however, it has been controlled by compulsory 
periodic examination of the miners. 

In building the Simplon tunnel the air became so hot deep within 
the shafts that sprays of cool water were used to cool it. Thousands 
of imported workmen of uncleanly habits were employed, who 
defecated in the tunnels, hence all the ideal conditions for an "epi- 
demic," namely, warmth, moisture and filth, were present. 

In the United States, according to Dr. C. S. Hotchkiss, of the 
United States Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, cases 
have developed in the coal mines of Virginia, West Virginia, North 
Carolina and the gold mines of Nevada and California, and excep- 
tionally in Pennsylvania, but he failed to find any in Colorado mines. 
He reports the finding of Cochin China diarrhea among miners in 
West Virginia. 

Dr. Herbert Gunn, of San Francisco, found 60 cases of anky- 
lostomiasis in Amador County, California, in 1905, all among for- 
eigners, and in January, 1911, reported a large number more, from 
50 to 80 per cent, of the men being affected in several gold mines. 
The miners defecate in the dark cross-cuts and pockets of the mines, 
where the temperature is .warm, often 80 to 90 F., and hence the 
soil becomes infested with the worm. Gunn found it in the soil 
of the mines inspected. It is his belief that the infection exists in 
most of the gold mines of California and in some in Nevada, having 
been imported by workmen from Austria, Italy or Cornwall, where 
the disease is endemic. 

Dr. C. W. Stiles discovered ankylostomiasis in coal, copper and 
gold mines in various parts of this country in 1902. One case was 
found in the Pennsylvania coal mines in 1904 by Wainwright and 



GERMS 451 

Nichols, who stated that "none of the anthracite mines of this coun- 
try . . . has any privy facilities under ground. The men deposit 
their excreta in any chamber or gangway handy." The wonder is 
that other soil infections such as dysentery and typhoid fever are 
not more common, as well as uncinariasis, among all our miners. 

The hookworm disease problem among miners is a very serious 
economic as well as humanitarian matter, mainly from the large 
number of victims moderately affected who continue to work, but 
do so very inefficiently. Gunn estimates the loss to one California 
mine from this cause as over $20,000 per year. The mortality of 
the untreated disease, moreover, is very high, and in Porto Rico 
has reached almost 30 per cent. The disease is by no means con- 
fined to miners, but in this country has of recent years been shown 
by Stiles to affect a large Southern rural population, consisting of 
farmers, bricklayers, tunnel workers, trench diggers, and similar 
classes of persons who come in contact with infected soil. Their 
children who go barefoot and are of dirty habits are very often 
infected. 

A temperature of 80 to 90 F. is most favorable to the parasites, 
hence they do not thrive in cold or temperate climates outside of 
mine or tunnel protection. The disease is sooner or later charac- 
terized by anemia, which may become so severe as closely to resemble 
pernicious anemia. Leukocytosis is not present, nor is extreme 
eosinophilia in many cases, although exceptionally eosinophiles have 
been present up to 24 per cent., and not rarely up to 5 or 6 per cent. 

The other symptoms are striking and peculiar: pallor of the 
face even when the blood count is not very low; a dull, heavy, list- 
less expression, manner, speech and gait ; increasing muscular weak- 
ness. The parasites occur abundantly in the stools. In exaggerated 
cases edema, ascites, progressive emaciation, a protuberant abdo- 
men and increasing stupor complete the clinical picture. Children, 
when infected, are of stunted growth. The victims often complain 
of gastro-intestinal pains and cramps, but not in every case, for they 
often appear too dull to complain of anything. 

Prevention. Prevention consists of the disinfection of infested 
soil, drying the soil by drainage, disinfection of infected stools of 



452 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

ankylostomiasis victims, proper foot covering and cleansing of the 
hands before eating. There should be absolute prevention of pro- 
miscuous defecating over the ground in rural districts, and deep 
trenches should be used so that the stools cannot be washed over the 
ground by showers, and so that they can be disinfected and deeply 
buried. In mines pails should be used, which when partly filled 
with feces should be soaked with formalin before emptying, or some 
disinfectant which will not further pollute the air of the mine. 

Treatment. The patient should be purged with calomel and 
next day, upon an empty stomach, two 5-grain doses of thymol should 
be given in capsules, with an interval of two hours between, after 
which a saline purge should be administered. Such large doses of 
thymol sometimes cause alarming symptoms of collapse, but smaller 
doses are not very effective. With very feeble patients it may be 
preferable to use felix mas. Castor oil should be avoided, as it may 
favor absorption of toxic products from the intestine. A single 
treatment often fails /to dislodge all the worms, some of which lie 
partly imbedded in the folds of mucous membrane. Hence, after an 
interval of a few weeks, the stools should be reexamined for ova, 
and, if any are found, further treatment must be given. In the 
interval it is recommended to give daily doses of 10 or 20 drops of 
oil of eucalyptus (Lindemann) to lessen the resistance of the para- 
sites. 

ANTHRAX 

Anthrax, called also malignant pustule or malignant edema, is 
an infection caused by the rod-shaped Bacillus anfliracis, which is 
obtainable from the patient's blood or from the pustules or edematous 
areas which the disease exhibits. The disease primarily affects 
cattle, horses, camels and sheep, which acquire it by inhaling the 
spores of the bacillus, probably while eating food which has in some 
manner become infected. 

Richter has expressed the belief that anthrax formerly played 
an important role in widespread epidemics, but at present the dis- 
ease is so much of a rarity in the United States that it is a surprise 
to find that in eight States it is included in the list of the six re- 



GEEMS 453 

portable occupational diseases, but this is accounted for by the fact 
that the first American reporting laws were copied almost verbatim 
from the British. 

Anthrax appears to be more prevalent in England than in the 
United States. In the five years 1899-1904, 261 cases were offi- 
cially recorded in England, including 67 deaths, whereas in Penn- 
sylvania, in 1897, Ravenal reported 12 cases among tanners using 
hides which came from China. Sixty cattle were also infected. 
The 261 English cases were divided as follows, as given by Neisser: 
wool industry 88, hides and tanning 86, hair and brush industry 70, 
miscellaneous 17. 

Drs. E. W. Hope and W. Hanna, of Liverpool, reported at the 
Fifteenth International Congress on Hygiene and Demography, in 
September, 1912, 60 cases of anthrax observed in Liverpool during 
the previous eight years. Thirty-six of the victims were engaged in 
unloading hides at wharves or in carting them. Six persons ac- 
quired the disease through handling horsehair in factories and 13 
by handling wool. 

In Bradford, England, during a period of several years, 71 cases 
of anthrax developed in the woollen industry, with 24 deaths, of 
which 15 were internal and 9 external in type. Two of the recovered 
cases were treated with Sclava's serum given intravenously, as much 
as 80 c. c. being used. 

In all England only 9 cases of anthrax were officially reported 
in 1910 and 11 in 1911. In Europe, in 1905, according to Kober, 
59 cases were recorded. Under the new reporting law of occupa- 
tional diseases in New York State, in the year 1911-12 there were 
only three cases of anthrax reported, one of which was in the leather 
tanning industry. Anthrax has been seen in butchers, shepherds, 
cattle salesmen, meat inspectors, workers in horsehair, camel's hair 
and hair brushes, tanners and those who transport hides or wool, and 
especially in wool carding and spinning. I know of three cases in 
the woolen carpet industry. Wool carding machinery separates the 
ibers, evolving much dust with which the spores are inhaled. The 
lisease was formerly called "wool sorter's disease," but it is the 
70ol carders, not the sorters, who constitute the usual victims. 



454 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

In London a case of anthrax occurred in a woman, the wife of a 
dock laborer, employed in unloading foreign hides, who became in- 
fected through contact with her husband's clothing. The medical in- 
spector found the anthrax germs in the leather derived from the 
hides, after they had been submitted to the tanning process. 

The following note is from the British laws of 1905 regarding 
the handling of imported wools, hides and hair: "The germs of the 
disease (anthrax spores) are found in the dust attaching to the 
wool, or in the excrement, and in the substance of the pieces of skin, 
and may remain active for years. In this country and Australia 
anthrax is rare, consequently there is little danger in handling wools 
from the sheep of these two countries, but in China, Persia, Turkey, 
Russia, the East Indies, and in many other parts of the world, the 
disease is common, and infected fleeces or locks (which may not 
differ from others in appearance) are often shipped to Great Britain. 
Hence, in handling foreign dry wools and hair, the above regulations 
should carefully be observed. Greasy wools are comparatively free 
from dust and therefore little risk is incurred in handling them. 
The disease is communicated to man sometimes by breathing or swal- 
lowing the dust from these wools or hair, and sometimes by the 
poison lodgirig in some point where the skin is broken, such as a 
fresh scratch or cut, or a scratched pimple, or even chapped hands. 
This happens more readily on the uncovered parts of the body, the 
hand, arm, face, and, most frequently of all, on the neck, owing 
either to infected wool rubbing against the bare skin or to dust from 
such wool alighting on the raw surface. But a raw surface covered 
by clothing is not free from risk, for the dust lodging upon the 
clothes may sooner or later work its way to the skin beneath. Infec- 
tion may also be brought about by rubbing or scratching a pimple 
with hand or finger nail carrying the anthrax poison. Use of the 
nailbrush, and frequent washing and bathing of the whole body, espe- 
cially of the arms, neck and head, will lessen the chance of con- 
tracting anthrax." 

Anthrax appears to be conveyed in the blood of the diseased 
animals slaughtered. This blood stains the wool or hides, and in 
this manner the anthrax spores, which possess considerable vitality, 



GERMS 455 

are transported to the tanneries or woollen mills. The spores have 
been found in the dried blood. 

In man the disease has been acquired (1) through eating dis- 
eased meat, (2) by inhalation of dust from infected wool, hides or 
hair, (3) through inoculation by means of cuts from knives used in 
dressing diseased animals or skins, hides, bristles, hair or wool, and 
(4) through bites of insects which have fed upon infected carcasses 
or other material. The common practice of carrying bundles of 
rough hides on the shoulder often causes abrasions of the skin, 
through which infection may take place. For example, the case was 
reported by Abner Post, of Boston, of a warehouse porter who be- 
came infected in the neck in this manner, and also, by placing an 
infected finger in the mouth, acquired similar infection in the stom- 
ach and intestines, which presented submucous hemorrhagic areas 
and ulcers from which the victim .died on the fifth day. 

The anthrax bacillus rods are from 4 to 6 times longer than the 
diameter of a red blood cell and possess long, slender, threadlike 
processes in which they develop spores. They are non-motile and 
undergo rapid fusion. The spores live for a considerable time on 
open pasture land. 

Symptoms. The incubation period of anthrax occupies less than 
three days and the symptoms present (a) an external and (b) an 
internal type. 

(a) EXTERNAL ANTHRAX. External anthrax is of two varieties, 
(1) malignant pustule and (2) malignant edema. 

(1) Malignant pustule begins as an inflamed pimple or boil, 
usually painless, although a sensation as of itching or burning may 
be complained of. The papule becomes hard, with a purple center 
and deep red zone of infiltration surrounding, with which appears a 
circle of minute papules, or vesicular areola. The central papule 
becomes vesicular and discharges a thick bloody serum, afterward 
forming a brown dry gangrene. A painful lymphangitis with hard 
edema may extend over the neck and down the arm. Local phlebitis 
also occurs in the edematous area. While this local process is de- 
veloping the patient complains of chilliness, anorexia, vomiting and 
prostration. The temperature in severe cases may reach 105 F., 



456 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

and delirium sometimes ensues. The victim may die within 4 or 
5 days, or linger for a week or two in a typhoidal condition, with 
tendency to a feeble pulse, syncope and collapse. 

The prognosis of this variety of the disease is always grave, 
but not necessarily fatal, particularly in cases in which the infec- 
tion is not focused in the neck, but in the leg. 

(2) Malignant edema involves the loose connective tissue in 
such situations as the eyelid, neck or forearm. I once saw it in the 
inner part of the thigh. The skin is not reddened and the inflam- 
mation is not well circumscribed, but spreads rapidly, with sloughing 
and gangrene. The constitutional symptoms are those of pyemia 
and the patient does not recover. 

Diagnosis of both these types is based upon the nature of the 
patient's occupation, and the finding of the bacilli in the fluid of 
the pustule or edema, or, in later stages, from the blood. 

(b) INTERNAL, ANTHRAX. Internal anthrax also appears under 
two types, (1) the intestinal or mycosis intestinalis and (2) the 
cerebral or pulmonary, which constitutes the typical "wool sorter's 
disease." 

(1) The intestinal form is rarely occupational, being caused 
usually by eating meat or drinking milk from infected animals. The 
invasion is very acute, with high fever (106 F.), a chill, pains in 
the head and back, vomiting, constipation, pain and tenderness in 
the abdomen and a rapid, feeble pulse. The spleen is palpable and 
there may be hemorrhage from the bowels. Dyspnea and cyanosis 
occur and the patient dies in two or three days in delirium or con- 
vulsions. 

(2) Wool sorter's disease results from inhalation of anthrax 
spores, and the lungs are primarily attacked. The constitutional 
symptoms are those of the internal type with addition of cough, pains 
in the chest and suffocation. There may be coma or maniacal de- 
lirium, and the bacilli have been found in the brain capillaries. 

Diagnosis is based upon the suddenness and violence of the respi- 
ratory symptoms, together with finding the bacilli in the sputum or 
blood. 

Prevention. The danger of anthrax infection in this country 



GERMS 457 

may be abolished by disinfection of hides before shipment. Imme- 
diately upon flaying they should be subjected to "wet-salting" with 
common salt, or to treatment with formic mercury, in solution, made, 
according to Ponder, with 1 to 2 per cent of formic acid and 0.02 
per cent, of mercuric perchlorid. The "soak" with salt solution 
causes the hides to swell and moistens any dry albuminous matter 
such as blood in which the anthrax spores may lodge, so that the 
disinfectant acts more effectively. 

A. Schattenfroh found that disinfection may be done effectually 
by pickling the hides for a few days in a 2 per cent, hydrochloric 
acid solution to which 10 per cent, of salt is added. Or a solution 
of 1 per cent, hydrochloric acid and 8 per cent, of salt is equally 
effective in 6 hours if the process is conducted at 40 C. 

Tanners and wool sorters, in handling foreign skins or wool, 
should not carry them upon the unprotected shoulder, and should 
guard against exposure from any cuts or scratches or "hangnails." 
They should cleanse the hands often in a 1 : 1,000 solution of cor- 
rosive sublimate. Wool sorters may be protected by wearing respira- 
tors, but thorough disinfection of the materials used is the only 
reliable preventive measure, and should be insisted upon absolutely. 

Treatment. A suspected focus of infection should be at once 
burned out with a cautery, and, if too late for this, the entire in- 
fected area must be excised, no matter how extensive it may be. 
Surrounding infected lymphatics should be excised also. Edema 
which cannot be dealt with by means of the knife should be treated 
with injections of a carbolic acid solution, dressed with 1 : 500 cor- 
rosive sublimate solution and an ice bag. 

Brandy, ammonia and strychnin should be given as stimulants. 
Preventive inoculations of various sorts, including antistreptococcus 
serums, have been tried, but, thus far, without encouraging results. 

FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE 

This disease, called also aphthous fever, is transmitted to man in 
exceptional instances as an occupational affection derived from cer- 
tain domestic animals. Hence it may attack butchers, cowboys, 



458 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

drivers, stablemen and horse dealers. It is characterized by vesicular 
stomatitis and a miliary, often pustular, eruption of the hands. Be- 
sides cattle, it attacks pigs, sheep and goats. In Texan ranches it 
formerly gave rise to widespread epidemics, characterized by vesicles 
and ulcers in the mouth, with furrows and ulcers in the feet and 
udders. The milk becomes yellow, thick, bitter and nauseous. The 
disease may be transmitted to man through infected meat as well 
as by handling cattle. Milkmen may inoculate their hands. 

Incubation in man lasts 4 or 5 days and the onset is acute, with 
chill, prostration and fever. Vesicles form on the tongue, lips, buccal 
mucosa and pharynx. Salivation occurs and the tongue is swollen. 
The fingers and hands show a miliary eruption and pustules. The 
disease is sometimes fatal, but recovery is usual at the end of a 
week. 

Treatment. The mouth should be washed every two hours with 
a 1 per cent, carbolic acid solution, or a permanganate solution of 
like strength, followed by a boric acid solution, ten grains to the 
ounce, of mucilage of acacia or tragacanth. To allay the pain of 
swallowing a 2 per cent, solution of cocain may be sprayed in the 
pharynx. Ulcers may be touched with argyrol. 

GLANDERS AND FARCY 

Glanders is an infective granuloma caused by the Bacillus mallei, 
a non-motile organism resembling the Bacillus tuberculosis in ap- 
pearance, but differing from it in behavior with stains and culture 
media. It is transmitted through abrasions of the skin or mucous 
membranes, or by inhalation of the dried mucus from the discharges 
which it produces. It is conveyed to man from horse, ass or 
mule, and also by direct inoculation from man to man. When 
affecting the mucous membranes the disease is called "glanders," but 
in the skin it is termed "farcy." 

It occurs among hostlers, horseshoers and teamsters, and at times 
has caused serious localized epidemics in cavalry regiments. 

Symptoms. The disease appears in an acute form and a much 
rarer chronic form. 



GERMS 



459 



ACUTE GLANDERS. Incubation lasts from 2 to 4 days. Then the 
nasal mucosa ulcerates and discharges a fetid, blood-stained fluid. 
Rapid necrosis of the nasal septum follows and ulceration extends 
to the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and bronchi. The skin 
of the nose and entire face becomes red, swollen and edematous, 
resembling erysipelas, but without blebs. There is lymphadenitis, 
with swelling of the lymph glands. The constitutional symptoms are 
those of pyemia, such as an irregular high temperature, chills, sweats, 
vomiting, diarrhea, brown, dry, tremulous tongue, rapid, feeble pulse, 




FIG. 87. ACUTE FARCY, SHOWING EXTENSIVE ERUPTION. (From a patient in 
Bellevue Hospital in 1910. Service of Dr. F. S. Meara.) 



delirium and coma. Pneumonia is a common complication, and a 
pustular eruption may extend over the face and joints, not unlike 
malignant smallpox. 

ACUTE FARCY. Around the site of infection there is a rapidly 
spreading local swelling, with pain and redness. In the vicinity 
nodules or "farcy buds" form along the lymphatics. A nodular 
pustular multiple eruption forms in the skin, rapidly extending over 
the entire body, as shown in the accompanying illustration of a pa- 
tient seen in Bellevue Hospital (Fig. 87), in whom the infection 
began near the left eye. The nodules become pustular, at first 
resembling the pustules of variola, but soon becoming larger and 
looking much more malignant. They have a purple or black areola 
and the pustules rupture, forming deep ulcers from one-fourth to an 
inch in diameter. The patient shown in the illustration presented 
groups of pustules all over the body, which in some cases followed 



460 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

the distribution of lymphatic trunks. The joints may suppurate and 
abscesses form in the muscles. The constitutional symptoms are 
those of pyemia. Most of these cases are fatal within ten days. 
The patient shown in the photograph, who was a stable helper, died 
on the seventh day. Mild cases sometimes terminate in recovery 
after two or three weeks. 

CHRONIC GLANDERS. Chronic glanders resembles syphilitic 
ozena. There is a fetid, purulent and bloody nasal discharge from 
deep ulcers within the nose, and subcutaneous abscesses may form, 
but without such lymphatic extension as occurs in the acute form. 
The larynx may be involved and a fatal suppurative meningitis 
may result, but recovery is not impossible in some cases after a few 
months. 

CHRONIC FARCY. In this rare condition large, hard, nodular 
tumors form in the limbs, which later ulcerate or produce abscesses. 
There are subperiosteal abscesses, and there may be pus in the knee 
joints. Pustules form at the margins of the serpiginous ulcers 
(Stein). 

Prevention, Prevention consists in the killing of infected ani- 
mals and thorough disinfection of their stalls, harness, etc. After 
handling such animals the hands and face should be washed with a 
1 : 20 carbolic acid solution. 

Treatment. The site of inoculation should instantly be cauter- 
ized with strong nitric acid or a hot iron. Farcy buds should be 
injected with a 1 : 20 carbolic acid solution. lodofonn should be 
insufflated into the nostrils, or they may be douched with chlorin- 
water or 1 : 1,000 corrosive sublimate solution. Stimulants and con- 
centrated fluid food should be given. An antitoxin known as "mal- 
lein" has been of service in treating glanders in animals. I have 
seen it tried in one or two cases in man without benefit. 

SEPTICEMIA 

Some occupations expose the workman to the dangers of septic 
infections. This is most liable to occur in the handling of putrid 
or decomposing animal products. C. F. W. Doehring, writing of the 



MISCELLANEOUS IERITANTS 461 

tallow industry in the Bulletin of the United States Department of 
Labor for January, 1903, says, "The workmen freely handle the offal 
in order to assort those parts which seem unsuited for use. The 
danger of blood poisoning is very great, but it can be prevented if 
in such work the men are supplied with gloves." 

The making of bone fertilizers is another industry in which the 
workmen are liable to infection if they happen to have abrasions of 
the hands. The carcasses of dead horses are largely used for this 
purpose. 

The case of a tanner whose fingers became so badly infected as 
to necessitate amputation was reported to the New York State Labor 
Bureau in 1912. 

The danger from infection by biting flies or insects which gain 
access to carcasses of horses or other animals used for bone fer- 
tilizers is great. A serious case of poisoning in this manner by a 
large horsefly is reported in the Bulletin of the United States Bureau 
of Labor (January, 1903, p. 105, No. 44). 

Men having open wounds or sores on the hands or arms should 
be debarred from work in dead animal material such as is used for 
fertilizers. 

Treatment. Localized septicemia should be treated by free in- 
cision, when necessary, of an infective focus, with antiseptic cleans- 
ing and dressing. Localized lymphangitis or cellulitis should be 
treated by rest and the constant external application of compresses of 
a cold saturated solution of aluminum acetate, or with a 1-40 ichthyol 
ointment. General septicemia should be met by cardiac stimulation 
and a diet consisting largely of milk, eggs and beef juice. In some 
cases the use of autochthonous vaccines should be employed.

LINSEED OIL 

Refined linseed oil is prepared by addition of one per cent, sul- 
phuric acid in leaden tanks. It is subsequently boiled and, to en- 
hance its drying or hardening by oxidation, some preparation of 



462 DISEASES DUE TO IERITANT SUBSTANCES 

lead such as litharge may be added. In the room in which the 
linseed is originally mashed and pressed a temperature of 125 F. 
may be developed (Doehring), but the workmen may be protected 
from the excessive heat, as well as fumes arising in the boiling 
process, by drafts of compressed air. With ordinary care there is 
not much hazard connected with the industry. 

OILCLOTH AND LINOLEUM 

Linoleum is composed of a groundwork of cloth over which is 
spread a mixture of linseed or cotton seed oil, resin and ground 
cork. Various colors are subsequently applied, sometimes contain- 
ing lead. The cork is very finely comminuted by grinding and 
makes, owing to its lightness, a very fine floating dust, which also 
contains fine particles of iron derived from attrition of the grinding 
machinery. This dust is highly inflammable and explosive. 

The oil dries as it oxidizes in the air, and, to hasten the harden- 
ing process, various oxidizing agents are added, such as zinc oxid, 
red lead, or litharge, sugar of lead, manganese superoxid, or sul- 
phurous manganese. The oil mixture is heated to approximately 
450 F., during which process irritant fumes are evolved. The 
mass is stirred by hand with ladles, which brings the workmen into 
close proximity to the toxic fumes. The linoleum, after pattern 
painting, is hung on long racks in rooms heated by steam or hot air. 

The cork dust is very irritating to the mucous membranes, caus- 
ing bronchitis. The vapors of oil and volatile resins irritate the 
eyes, nose and bronchi, causing conjunctivitis, rhinitis, purulent 
bronchitis, and, as Eulenburg states, they may produce hemoptysis. 
Burns may result from spattering in stirring the boiling oil. Where 
lead is added as an oxidizing or hardening agent there is some 
danger of poisoning from its fumes. The careless handling of the 
resins may give rise to eczema or other forms of cutaneous irritation. 

Prevention. Prevention should consist in the use of ventilating 
hoods and exhausts, the covering of boiling kettles and provision for 
mechanical instead of hand stirring. For cork dust, measures 
recommended on page 391 for protection against volatile dusts may 
be employed.

are used, all of which develop toxic fumes. In coloring rubber and

and "marbling," and, for scouring soaps, powdered silica (See page 
419) are also used. The processes involve boiling and clarification. 

The preparation of margarin and stearin from animal fats is 
by crushing and tearing the fat tissues, and separating the fats by 
solution in dilute sulphuric acid, melting with steam in closed drums, 
etc. With the high temperatures employed, irritant, corrosive and 
extremely foul-smelling and nauseous vapors may be evolved and 
inhaled, such .as those of acrolein, acetic and butyric acids, pyridin, 
sulphur ammonium and ammonium cyanid. 

Symptoms. The disease hazards involved in soap and fat-render- 
ing establishments concern- chiefly the respiratory and digestive sys- 
tems, and, according to Heinrich Griin, of Vienna, the former are 
more prevalent in winter, the latter in summer, which is due in great 
part to differences in temperature and ventilation. The fatty acids 
particularly, when vaporized with steam, irritate the larynx, causing 
chronic laryngitis and cough. Acute and chronic bronchitis also pre- 
vail. The workers in the raw fat materials, which are often rancid, 
suffer much from gastro-intestinal catarrh, with nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea. This is in part attributable, according to Griin, to the 
inhaling and swallowing in the fat-rendering rooms of the hot vapors 
impregnated with alkalies which neutralize the acid gastric juice 
and irritate the mucosa. The nauseous vapors further may cause 
headache, vertigo, abdominal cramps, anemia and malnutrition. The 
vomitus is usually very foul smelling. Herpes facialis is observed 



MISCELLANEOUS IRRITANTS 465 

and fever may be present. Another cause for these symptoms exists 
in the inhalation and swallowing of the fatty acids, which thereby 
come into very direct contact with the stomach, irritating it both 
mechanically and chemically (Grim). 

In many cases the gastric catarrh becomes chronic and the pa- 
tient complains of pyrosis, gastric oppression or pain, a coated 
tongue, foul breath and anorexia. There may be icterus, phos- 
phaturia and nervous disturbances such as neuralgia and neuras- 
thenia. Toilet soaps which contain perfumery are treated with es- 
sential oils, the vapors from which are especially liable when inhaled 
to induce the above described digestive and nervous disorders. These 
vapors and the pigments which are added also sometimes give rise 
to renal and vesical irritation, such as mild grades of acute nephritis 
and vesical catarrh, with a strong odor in the urine of the essen- 
tial oils. 

It should be remembered that workers in slaughter houses, fat- 
rendering establishments, etc., work under such gross and unpleas- 
ant Surroundings that they often are addicted to alcoholism, which 
is, no doubt, responsible for many of the gastro-intestinal symp- 
toms. 

Conjunctivitis is common among soap makers, induced by the 
irritation of the alkaline and fatty acid vapors. Chronic blepharitis 
is often observed. 

Eczema of the hands and arms arises from contact with the alka- 
line fatty acid and ethereal oil mixtures to which they are exposed. 
It also occurs over the abdomen at the waist line from the habit of 
leaning against the kettles of fat. 

The men who clean and prepare the soap fats, which are often 
rancid, and those who prepare margarin frequently acquire cuts or 
abrasions which may become infected, showing an erysipelatous erup- 
tion with lymphadenitis. 

Prevention. Prevention consists in affording and enforcing 
means of cleanliness and opportunities for frequent washing. The 
clothing should be changed before going home, so that all working 
clothes may be kept in the work place. 

The chronic gastritis is best treated by the use of calcined mag- 



466 DISEASES DUE TO IRRITANT SUBSTANCES 

nesia with bismuth and soda, which tend to neutralize the fatty 
acids. Mucus may be washed out by lavage or by copious drafts 
of alkaline Vichy. Occasional doses of calomel are serviceable.

I. AIR MODIFICATION 

COMPRESSED AIR ILLNESS 

TUNNEL AND CAISSON WORKERS 

Historical Experiments and Theories. \ r an Rensselaer states: 
"The first experiment that has been recorded of the employment of 
compressed air occurred in the beginning of the sixteenth century, 
when two Greeks, fti the presence of Charles V. and several thousand 
spectators, let themselves down under water in a large inverted kettle 
and rose again without wetting themselves." 

Caissons were first used by the engineer Triger in 1839. He ap- 
plied them in coal mining through wet strata at Chalons, on the 
Loire. Shortly afterward the effects of the compressed air upon 
the workmen and an early study of theni was presented by Pol and 
Wattelle in the Annales d'hygiene publique, in 1854. Three years 
later Hoppe-Seyler advanced the theory that the symptoms of caisson 
disease are referable to the sudden liberation of bubbles of air which 
have been forced into the blood by increased pressure. Of the cor- 
rectness of this view there is no longer any doubt, as it has many 
times been confirmed both experimentally and clinically. 

The first thorough study of the effects of high atmospheric pres- 
sure made in this country was conducted by the late Dr. Andrew H. 
Smith, of New York, in 1873, as a prize essay for the Alumni Asso- 
ciation of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. 

In 1879 Paul Bert, in "La pression barometrique," demon- 
strated experimentally that increased atmospheric pressures up to 8 

467 



468 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

atmospheres are harmless to the circulation and other functions, 
after which the partial pressure of the oxygen of the absorbed air 
may exercise toxic effects upon the tissues. He also proved experi- 
mentally, what was beginning to be appreciated clinically, that the 
evil results of compressed air under practical pressures are devel- 
oped solely through too rapid decompression. 

In 1895 Leonard Hill confirmed and added to the experimental 
work of Bert, and, in 1899, Lorrain Smith showed in animals that 
exposure to 2 or 3 atmospheres of oxygen for five or more continu- 
ous hours may give rise to pulmonary inflammation. Xo such con- 
dition obtains, however, in caissons, where the percentage of oxygen 
in the compressed air is unaltered. Inhalation of pure oxygen, for- 
merly so much used clinically in pneumonia and other conditions for 
hours at a time, while it is of doubtful therapeutic value, is cer- 
tainly not harmful. In such cases much ordinary air enters with 
the oxygen, as respiratory masks are seldom used. 

In 1900 three German experimenters, von Schrotter, Mager and 
Heller, demonstrated the local ischemia in the spinal cord and else- 
where which is caused by air bubbles, chiefly nitrogen, blocking the 
circulation in the smaller capillaries, and advocated, for a safety limit, 
decompression at a fixed allowance throughout of 2 minutes for each 
tenth of an atmosphere, or 20 minutes per atmosphere. As this 
would mean a full hour for the decompression of the ordinary tun- 
nel worker in compressed air, it is wholly impracticable, as will be 
shown further on. 

A most ingenious demonstration was made by Leonard Hill. A 
frog was placed in a small air-tight chamber, with the web of its feet 
made visible by an arc light projection through a glass window and 
magnified upon a screen. Quickly raising and lowering the air 
pressure up to 20 atmospheres and more had no effect upon the rate 
of capillary circulation, but when sudden decompression was made 
after long continued complete saturation of the animal's blood with 
air, nitrogen bubbles developed and became so large as to stop the 
circulation. Kecompression caused these bubbles "to shrink and dis- 
appear again." Hill also found that in dog's blood "one per cent, 
of nitrogen is dissolved per atmosphere," Rats were killed by rapid 



AIR MODIFICATION 469 

recompression from 10 atmospheres. They were then decapitated 
and their bodies chopped up under water. The liberated gas, col- 
lected under a funnel, was found to contain: nitrogen, 80 to 87.2 
per cent. ; 10.7 to 16 per cent, carbon dioxid, and only 2.1 to 4 per 
cent, oxygen, because the oxygen absorbed under pressure unites 
chemically with the blood and is not again liberated. Hence "oxy- 
gen bubbles are not a factor in caisson sickness." Hill found that 
in animals killed by rapid decompression from 7 or 8 atmospheres, 
gas bubbles form in the fat droplets of the tissue cells, such as the 
liver and kidney, which actually vacuolize and disrupt the structure 
of the tissue cells. The liver and kidneys may appear "foamy with 
bubbles in such a case." He found the alveoli of the lungs ruptured 
by the violent air expansion, causing emphysema. Such lesions have 
been observed in men killed by a caisson bursting. Boycott and 
Damant, of the British Navy, have shown that fat animals are much 
more seriously affected than lean, and Hill confirmed this observa- 
tion upon fat and lean pigs. In 1907 Vernon, of Oxford, demon- 
strated that oils and fats exposed to one atmosphere of increasing 
pressure absorb 5 times as much air as does water. Haldane showed 
that "fat dissolves about 6 times as much nitrogen as blood," and 
animals after death from decompression show many fine gas bubbles 
in the fat tissues. 

The obvious conclusion is that fat men run great risks in caisson 
work, and caisson workers should not eat much fat-forming food. 

Pure oxygen inhaled under high pressure was shown by Bert to 
affect profoundly the central nervous system, causing convulsions, 
and Hill found that continuous exposure to 7 atmospheres of air 
which is equivalent to 170 per cent, of an atmosphere of oxygen 
causes fatal pneumonia, which "can be prevented by using nitrogen 
to dilute the air, and so lowering the partial pressure *of oxygen," 
but "it is quite safe to breathe one atmosphere of oxygen, equivalent 
to 5 atmospheres of air, for 3 to 4 hours." As a matter of fact, this 
is precisely what tunnel workers in compressed air sometimes do, 
although their usual shift is 2 hours. Men wearing the Fleuss res- 
cue hoods in mines frequently breathe pure oxygen for as long a 
time, but under moderate pressure. 



470 DISEASES DUE TO HAKMFUL ENVIEONMENT 

So long as the lungs receive enough oxygen for the needs of the 
system, as Hill says, "man cannot be fanned into a greater rate of 
activity by breathing oxygen," but, on the other hand, greatly in- 
creased pressures of oxygen are toxic, lowering metabolism and 
checking carbonic acid elimination. 

The accumulation of carbon dioxid in tunnels and caissons under 
pressure has been much discussed as a possible factor in compressed 
air disease, but the heat and moisture of the air are more impor- 
tant factors of discomfort, for there is little motion of the caisson air 
to promote evaporation from the body surface. In a long tunnel, 
moreover, the lack of motion in the air results in considerable accu- 
mulation of exhaled carbon dioxid in the zone nearest the work- 
men. Personal comfort is much promoted by the use of electric 
fans to keep the air in motion, thoroughly mix it, and favor evapora- 
tion from the body, even, as Hill found, when the carbonic acid gas 
may rise to 4 or 5 per cent, in the chamber. These unfavorable con- 
ditions naturally promote fatigue and cause discomfort, but it should 
be borne in mind that caisson and tunnel workers are hardy men, 
in previous robust health, and their hours of actual work are so 
short that they can withstand unfavorable atmospheric conditions 
which would soon become intolerable if maintained continuously for 
longer periods. 

Nevertheless, fatigue adds to the hazard of decompression, be- 
cause of the coincident depression of the functions of respiration and 
circulation. The decompression chamber is always relatively cool, 
owing to the expansion of the air, and, if the outside air be winter 
air, the shock to the peripheral circulation by the vasoconstriction 
induced by cold is considerable. Hence one is apt to feel chilly on 
coming out of a caisson. I have observed this personally on coming 
out of less than an additional atmosphere of pressure. 

For these reasons it is desirable for the caisson worker in cold 
weather to remain for a time in a warm room on leaving the caisson, 
and in the caisson the wet bulb hygrometer should not be allowed to 
register above 75 F., and preferably 70 F. Where this is not 
possible electric fans should be operated to promote evaporation from 
the bodies of the perspiring laborers. 



AIR MODIFICATION 471 

In 1890, while engaged in physiological research in the Loomis 
Laboratory in New York, I conducted a series of experiments upon 
animals under heavy pressures of normal air and pure oxygen in a 
small cylinder which I adapted for the purpose from a locomotive 
piston cylinder. I subjected frogs, pigeons, cats, dogs, guinea pigs 
and monkeys to pressure, varying it up to 8 atmospheres or 120 Ibs. 
There were no essential differences in any of these animals in their 
behavior under high pressures, nor was there any apparent differ- 
ence in symptoms resulting from pure oxygen under pressure as 
compared with normal air under like pressures. The animals were 
observed through glass windows in the ends of the caisson. When 
pressure was first turned on they became restless, but soon after 4 
atmospheres were reached they became very drowsy and usually evac- 
uated both urine and feces. On passing 7 atmospheres usually, and 
on reaching 8 atmospheres invariably, convulsions ensued while the 
animal was still within the caisson. I experimented with decom- 
pression both uniform and interrupted, and even when made very 
rapidly, as in the case of a monkey, reducing the pressure at the 
rate of an atmosphere a minute, paraplegia did not follow, and 
after recovery from a slight chill the animals were as lively as nor- 
mal upon removal from the caisson. 

Of course such conditions with animals at rest are very different 
from those under which men are doing hard labor in tunnel and 
caisson work. Nevertheless, the lower animals appear considerably 
less susceptible than man to sudden great alterations in atmospheric 
pressure. In the old Hudson River tubes, built many years ago 
and abandoned, mules were kept for several months continuously 
under pressure, but suffered in no wise therefrom. On final decom- 
pression a few, W. E. Moir states, had the "bends," but soon re- 
covered completely. 

My own experience in experimenting with the smaller animals, 
which showed that they differ very little from one another in the 
symptoms produced by varying air pressures, is confirmed by William 
Japp, who says, "Our own experiments showed that we could pro- 
duce no obvious effects in mice, and very few in rabbits, rats and 
guinea pigs, by sudden decompression after exposures at pressures 



472 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 



which were invariably or frequently fatal to goats," the average 
respiratory exchange of which he shows to be about two- thirds more 
than that of man. This may account for some discrepancies shown 
by experiments on these animals. 

Structure and Mode of Operation of the Caisson. A caisson is a 
large box, usually made of wood, iron or concrete, which is weighted 

on top and sunk, by aid of a bottom cut- 
ting edge, into mud, sand or earth, 
either at the bottom of rivers or in 
moist earth, which would cave in un- 
less the moisture is kept out by air 
pressure. (Fig. 89.) If lowered to 
a river bed, the caisson may be built 
on a raft or pontoon which is 
weighted. As the structure sinks, the 
pontoon is removed from underneath 
and the caisson is continually built up 
at the top as it gradually sinks to the 
bottom. It is often reinforced by 
driving large piles at the corners, to 
keep it upright and in place. The 
caisson is fitted with a hoisting shaft 
through which excavated material is 
removed, and a shaft for descent of 
the workmen, both of which are, of 
course, furnished with locks. (Fig. 
90.) There must also be an exhaust 
pipe for pumping out water, a series 
of pipes, usually 4 inches in diame- 
ter, for supplying compressed air, 

electric light wires and some form of 
USED FOR 

signaling system. The necessary 
pumps to operate these systems may 

be placed on a boat anchored in the river, or near by on shore, or, if 
the caisson be sunk on land, as in excavating for a "skyscraper" 
building, through wet sand, they are placed anywhere near at hand.

There is also constructed a small house 
in which the workmen, who are called 
"sand hogs," may dress for the work 
and in which they may be warmed on 
coming out of the air locks. In large 
caissons 2,000 or 3,000 cubic feet of 
air may have to be forced in per min- 
ute. Timber for shoring and concrete 
for building tubes or foundations may 
be let into the caisson through a shaft. 
Telephone connection is sometimes 
installed at the bottom of the cais- 
son. 

In the smaller caissons sometimes 
only one shaft and lock is installed for 
both men and material. According to 
T. Kennard Thomson (Scientific Amer- 
ican Supplement, No. 1711, Oct. 17, 
1908), a bucket may get jammed in 
such a shaft. He says, "This has fre- 
quently happened, keeping the men in 
the compressed air for 10 or 12 hours 
overtime, sometimes with very danger- 
ous results," for they are fatigued, with- 
out food, and in great anxiety. In the 
small caissons used for foundations of 
tall buildings the men work, according 
to Mr. Ryan, at pressures varying from 
32 to 42 Ibs. above the atmosphere. 
They usually work in 3-hour shifts with 
3-hour intervals. (Fig. 91.) 

In digging out the floor of the cais- 
son the men begin at the center, "leav- 
ing a small bench around the cutting 
edge, and then removing this just be- 
fore they are ready to let the caisson

sink further, or 'drop/ which is accomplished by lowering the air 
pressure for a few moments." -(Thomson.) In tidal rivers, in 
weighting the caisson, allowance must be made for the rising tide, or 
the caisson may be ripped from its bed and the men may be killed. 
In an accident of this sort in the Hudson River Tunnel a workman 
was shot out into the river, but managed to float to the top and was 
rescued. On the coast of Nova Scotia, where the tides are very high, 
an iron caisson broke away and was lost in the sea. 

It requires one pound of atmospheric pressure to hold back 2 
feet 4 inches of water, i. e., every 33 ft. of water pressure must be 
countermet by an additional atmosphere, or 15 Ibs. of air pressure, 
or water will leak into the caisson. The ordinary air pressure em- 
ployed for subaqueous work is about 32 Ibs. above the normal, or 
47 Ibs. in all, but sometimes a pressure of 10 or even 15 Ibs. more 
becomes necessary temporarily where shifting quicksand as well as 
water is to be held back. 

EFFECT UPON THE WORKMEN OF COMPRESSED AIR IN THE CAIS- 
SON. When a workman enters the air lock the air at first is of 
course at normal pressure. He closes the door, which is kept shut 
from the inside as soon as the air pressure begins to rise. There is at 
first a sensation of pressure at the ear drums, which are forced 
inward by the air pressure. If the man closes the nostrils with his 
thumb and finger and closes the mouth, and attempts to expire, air 
is forced into the middle ear through the Eustachian tube, so that 
the tympanic pressure is equalized. An attempt at swallowing may 
accomplish the same result, if the nose and mouth be closed, by open- 
ing the Eustachian tubes. If the workman is unable to do this for 
any reason, as when he has a cold and the Eustachian orifice is 
swollen or plugged with mucus, the tympanum may rupture with 
agonizing pain. Hemorrhage also may take place into the middle 
ear. Rarely one of the cerebral vessels may burst if the pressure 
of the air be too rapidly augmented. The sinuses connected with 
the nose, if occluded by catarrhal exudate, may give rise to pain 
from modifications in air pressure. 

At low pressures, not above 32 Ibs. more than the atmospheric, 
or 47 Ibs. in all, workmen may remain in the caisson 8 hours a day, 



AIR MODIFICATION 



475 



with a half hour for lunch, but at over 3 or 4 atmospheres of pressure, 
47 to 60 Ibs., they can only work 1^ to 2 hours twice a day, with a 
rest of 4 hours between. One of my patients, who had paraplegia, 




FIG. 91. SMALL CAISSON SHOWING WORKMAN DESCENDING IN BUCKET INTO

had been working for 2-hour periods under 4 atmospheres under 
the Hudson River, where the New York City aqueduct was being 
laid at great depth. 

T. K. Thomson says, "It is very rare for a man to be paralyzed 
while in the air chamber, though some have been killed the first time 



476 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

they have entered, and before they could get out" ; and some ex- 
perienced men claim that they can tell when they are going to 
get the "bends," or be paralyzed, while still under compression, in 
spite of the assertion of several writers and experimenters that all 
forms of caisson disease are contracted "only during decompres- 
sion." 

Hersant, in the Bordeaux harbor caissons, in 1895, tried the 
experiment successfully of keeping a man under 76.8 Ibs. pressure 
for one hour, consuming f hour to reach this pressure and 3 hours 
for decompression. 

There are no noticeable effects upon blood pressure in man while 
in the caisson, or upon the rate or force of respiration. Sweating is 
common, because the compressed air is increased in warmth. 

There are some differences which should be borne in mind as to 
the effect of working in tunnels under compressed air and in the 
small caissons, sunk for making foundations for bridges, "skyscrap- 
ers," etc. In the long tunnels bulkheads or cross partitions often 
are constructed, thus subdividing the tunnel into two or more parts 
which may be kept under different pressures. Thus, in coming out 
from the furthest compartment, where pressure is highest, the work- 
man is subjected in the next compartment to an interrupted lowering 
of pressure. Moreover, in a long tunnel, perhaps half a mile in 
length, the workman has to walk considerable distances. Many more 
workmen (sometimes over 100) are together than in the small cais- 
son (Fig. 92), which often holds only one man, as shown in Figure 
91, and the air is contaminated with fumes from blasting powder, 
dust, smoke, carbon dioxid, and sometimes gaseous products of de- 
composition or organic matter in the river bed. Other symptoms 
may therefore arise, not due to the air pressure alone. In the small 
caisson, on the other hand, most of these conditions do not obtain, 
and the workman is in a confined space, subject only to his own 
exhalations, for if he sets a blast he must come out, for he cannot 
retreat otherwise to safety as the tunnel worker may. 

The percentage of carbon dioxid present in the caisson serves, to 
some extent only, as an index of the quality of the air breathed. 
Hill and Greenwood claim that this may reach 2. per cent, without 



AIR MODIFICATION 477 

harm, and records of the Pennsylvania East River Tunnels failed 
to show that the percentage of CO 2 had anything to do with the 
occurrence of compressed air illness. Considerable carbon monoxid 
was developed in blasting, but this was not shown to be in any way

made more toxic by the air compression in which it necessarily 
shared. 

Pathology and Morbid Anatomy. PATHOLOGY. The men per- 
form hard work, digging, lifting rocks, etc., under an atmospheric 
pressure of 30 to 45 Ibs. or more, i. e., from two to three atmospheres. 
They enter successive air locks wherein the pressure is slowly in- 
creased, and they should come out as slowly, but they are always in 
a rush to get out after their two-hour shift, and coming out too 
quickly has the effect of stepping into a gigantic cupping glass, i. e., 
their blood and respiratory organs, being saturated with air at 45 Ibs. 
of pressure, they suddenly step into the normal 15 Ibs. pressure. 



478 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

Just what happens under these conditions is best explained in the 
words of Dr. Keays as follows: "The blood of a man or animal 
when in compressed air takes into solution an increased quantity of 
oxygen and nitrogen from the air, the quantity of gases absorbed 
being in direct proportion to the increase of pressure. The gases 
taken up by the blood are gradually distributed to the fluids of the 
various tissues. With rapid decompression the nitrogen gas bubbles 
off in the blood and is eliminated by the lungs. These bubbles act 
as emboli and block up the capillaries in one or another part of the 
body, and by cutting off the blood supply, or by direct mechanical 
violence, cause the various symptoms of compressed air illness. 
The symptoms may be prevented by making decompression slow 
enough to allow the absorbed nitrogen to escape from the lungs. The 
blood supply of the central nervous system suffers proportionately 
the most, perhaps because of the fact that the blood vessels of the 
brain and spinal cord are> contained within the unyielding bony 
structures of the cranium and spinal column. Hence it is that the 
symptoms, although varied, are mainly referable to the spinal cord 
and its nerves." The size of the nitrogen bubbles and the rapidity 
with which they are liberated are in direct proportion to the rapidity 
of decompression. 

Body saturation varies in length of time, and the fat tissues 
become saturated much more slowly than the others, for the blood 
supply of fatty structures is relatively poor, and Haldane and Boy- 
cott estimate that its coefficient of nitrogen absorption is six times 
greater than that of other body tissues or fluids. They estimate that 
the average human body may become half saturated with nitrogen 
under high pressure in 25 minutes and the entire body in an hour 
and a half. Keays places the limit for full saturation much later, 
making it about 3 hours for workmen under a pressure of 32 atmos- 
pheres above the normal; hence little if any more gas is absorbed 
after that period. The practical bearing of this subject is shown in 
the fact that many of the severer cases of "bends" follow the com- 
paratively brief exposures of men working in the shorter shifts. The 
symptoms, therefore, are proportional to the duration of exposure to 
the pressure only up to the period when saturation has been reached, 



AIR MODIFICATION 479 

and Keays believes that better results may be obtained by working a 
continuous 6-hour shift, for example, than by dividing it into 3-hour 
periods. Doubling the number of decompressions doubles the risk. 

MORBID ANATOMY. The post-mortem findings comprise two 
classes of cases: (1) Those cases in which death has been sudden 
and in which the blood and tissues are found saturated with gas, but 
in which there has not been time for organic lesions to develop. Of 
this group von Schrotter collected 11 in the literature reported prior 
to 1897, and Keays has added 8 more from personal experience. (2) 
Those cases in which death results after protracted illness. In this 
group spinal cord lesions of disseminated and transverse myelitis 
with hemorrhages are present, with such usual complications of these 
lesions as pneumonia, cystitis and pyonephrosis, with trophic disturb- 
ances such as bed-sores, purpura, etc. Von Schrotter found 20 such 
cases reported in the literature prior to 1897, and Keays has added 
two more. In a certain number of rapidly fatal cases no lesion is 
discoverable, and Keays supposes this to be "due to the involvement 
of vital centers by emboli too small to be detected." 

Howard Van Rensselaer, in an exhaustive study of 27 reported 
autopsies upon victims of compressed air illness, says they "permit 
the conclusion that most, if not all, cases of caisson disease are due 
to lesion of the cord, which attains its greatest intensity in the lower 
dorsal region, and which attacks the white matter rather than the 
gray, and which is of a degenerative nature, or due to a diffuse 
parenchymatous myelitis. The greatest amount of degeneration oc- 
curs in the posterior and adjacent portion of the lateral columns, 
diminishing anteriorly so that the anterior columns are but slightly 
affected; the gray matter being for the most part normal. Even in 
the most intensely degenerated portion there is no total destruction 
of all the nerve substance. Above and below this area of disease in 
the lower dorsal region are, respectively, the usual ascending degener- 
ations of the columns of Goll and the direct cerebellar tract, and de- 
scending degenerations of the pyramidal tract." 

' Symptoms. As stated above, workmen under compressed air 
rarely show serious symptoms while under compression, although 
there are occasional exceptions. It is upon leaving the tunnel or 



480 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 



caisson that the symptoms are manifest, either immediately or some- 
times after an interval of half an hour, or rarely several hours. In 
either case the symptoms begin with great suddenness. The patient 
doubles up with weakness and vertigo and pains in the back and 
legs, and cannot stand erect. Hence the names, "the bends," 
"screws" and the "staggers," which the workmen apply to their 
symptoms. Shortly afterward complete paralysis of the legs, and 
sometimes of the arms, results, and the disease is often never re- 
covered from. In some cases there is painful constriction of the 
chest, which the workmen term the "chokes." Some patients are 
benefited by putting the victim back into the high pressure, which 
stops liberation of the bubbles, and then very slowly liberating him, 
for the symptoms almost never occur while under compression. In 
many cases, unfortunately, more or less permanent paralysis results. 
In cases with cerebral hemorrhage there may be aphasia, and coma 
may also result. Subcutaneous hemorrhages sometimes occur. In 
many cases there are pains in various parts of the body besides the 
back, as in the abdomen, head or arms, and the arms may become 
paralyzed exceptionally. 

The symptoms in detail cannot better be stated than by quoting 
again from the large experience of Keays, which comprised 3,692 
cases, in which he classifies the symptoms in groups as follows : 



A. Cases showing pain in various parts of the 

body, "bends" 

Cases with pain also having local manifes- 
tations

In exceptional cases localized subcutaneous emphysema has been 
observed. Erdman met with this symptom twice, occurring in the 
leg, and Keays records 9 cases. 

There is great variability in the mode of occurrence of the symp- 
toms of compressed air illness and the results of treatment. The 
same man may suffer less from high pressures on one day than he 
has previously with much lower pressures. Moreover, methods of 
treatment, successful on one occasion, may fail completely on an- 
other. There is no means of forecasting what the effect may be in 
a given case on different days. 

T. K. Thomson, engineer to the Harlem River caissons in New 
York, reports the following very interesting observation (Scientific 
American Supplement, No. 1711, Oct. 17, 1908) : "In sinking 
caissons in the Harlem River we found that men suffered severely 
from the bends while passing through the foul silt and just below 
the bottom of the river, and that when this material had been passed 
through and the caisson had entered the clean (no sewage mixture) 
clay, the trouble with the bends disappeared, although the pressure 
was necessarily very much greater." 

Observations of this kind illustrate the complexity of the prob- 
lem of explaining all the phenomena of compressed air illness, and 
I have heard both Dr. Keays and Mr. Ryan state that the more one 
studies these phenomena the more difficult of explanation they be- 
come. In the example of the Harlem River caissons, doubtless foul 
gases from sewage or other decomposing organic material, sul- 
phuretted hydrogen, marsh gas, carbonic acid gas, etc., contributed to 
the hazard, so that the mere formation of bubbles, which may act me- 
chanically by obstructing the circulation, does not completely ex- 
plain the phenomena. When such noxious gases arising from blast- 
ing or candles obtain access to the atmosphere of a caisson they, too, 



482 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

are placed under partial pressure, together with the chemically 
inert nitrogen of the air, and doubtless exert powerful chemo-toxic 
effects on the tissues of the body. 

Thomson points out that, in excavating, air is constantly passing 
out from under the cutting edge of the caisson and is replaced by 
fresh air from the compression pipes, thus maintaining a fair cir- 
culation in the caisson. When a concrete floor has been laid, how- 
ever, this air escape is checked, the air supply in the caisson becomes 
foul, anil the size of the air space is diminished by the concrete 
foundation. In such cases, Thomson writes, "Sometimes old-timers 
have gone in to uncouple the bolts in the upper sections of the shaft 
and in a short time have been taken out dead." They are, no doubt, 
killed as much by the foulness of the air as by the compression, or, 
in other words, the breathing of compressed foul air is naturally 
much more promptly fatal than the breathing of pure air under the 
same pressure. Hence in such cases the effect is due more to chemi- 
cal changes in the tissues than to mechanical effects of bubbles. In 
an illustration cited by Thomson a rubber pipe once caught fire, 
and, the fumes being forced into the chamber, the workmen barely 
were rescued. In another case the fumes of a blast penetrated an 
adjoining air chamber where were a number of workmen under 
pressure, one of whom was taken out killed. 

From the experiments on bubbles in the circulation, above cited, 
Hill offers an explanation of the recurrence of symptoms after re- 
compression, unless subsequent decompression be made extremely 
slowly. It is that, owing to coalescence of some of the air bubbles in 
the capillaries to form larger ones, "on recompression some of these 
bubbles persist when the pressure is raised again to +90 Ibs., and 
enlarge again on lowering the pressure," hence the reason for very 
slow redecompression after coming out of the medical lock used for 
treatment. 

Symptoms of any kind rarely occur in workmen who have not 
been exposed to more than one additional atmosphere of pressure even 
for 6 or 8 hours, and fatal results are rare below 2 atmospheres or 
30 Ibs. pressure above the normal. Keays met with one fatal case 
at 28 Ibs. and one at 29 Ibs., and among more than 4,000 workmen 



AIR MODIFICATION 483 

employed at an average of 32 Ibs. pressure there was an average of 
nearly one per cent, of instances of compressed air illness. The 
men who enlist in tunnel and caisson compressed air work in this 
country are usually Irishmen, Swedes and negroes. They work hard 
and eat well, so that, Thomson says, "we seldom see a lean sand-hog." 

Personal idiosyncrasy plays a considerable role in the acquisition 
of caisson disease, and Keays found that occasionally new workmen 
who appeared perfectly sound promptly succumbed to the disease, 
and, on the contrary, it happened occasionally that long-tried work- 
men who had never shown symptoms under high pressure would be 
attacked while working under identical conditions to which they 
had been accustomed, but with lower pressure. In a series of 190 
cases reported by Silberstern in Weil's "Handbuch der Arbeiter 
Krankheiten," 1908, there were 94 with pains in joints and muscles, 
35 with spinal cord symptoms, only one of which showed perma- 
nent paralysis, 17 cases of Meniere's syndrome, 5 cases of other 
cerebral symptoms, and 27 cases of tympanic or middle ear affection. 
In addition were 12 cases of asphyxia, only two of which proved 
fatal. 

Dr. Peter Bassoe, in a Report on Compressed Air Disease, pub- 
lished by the Illinois State Commission on Occupational Diseases 
(January, 1911), tabulates the symptoms of the following cases re- 
corded in St. Louis and Chicago as follows : 

"Of the 161 cases, 87 had various affections of the ear, and 65 of 
these had resulting impairment of hearing, some of them also more 
or less permanent ringing in the ears. One hundred and forty-one 
had pains, chiefly in the limbs, and very severe at first, the so-called 
'bends.' Thirty-four had paralysis, which was generally temporary, 
though three men have permanent partial paralysis of one arm and 
two of the legs. Eleven were left with considerable stiffness and 
pain in bones and joints. Twelve presented symptoms of some de- 
gree of permanent disease of the spinal cord. Thirteen were deliri- 
ous or unconscious during the acute attack. Thirty-three complained 
of dizziness as a prominent symptom, six of vomiting, and eleven 
of incontinence or retention of urine. Five had numbness without 
paralysis. Six had 'blind staggers' and two had 'chokes.' From 



484 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

reliable sources it was learned that three men, two of them negroes, 
died this year of compressed air disease at East St. Louis (Missis- 
sippi bridge), and one during the construction of the Traction bridge 
at St. Louis." 

Clinical Cases. One of the caisson patients shown at my clinic, 
in 1906, was a Russian, 33 years of age. He was not syphilitic or 
alcoholic. He had worked in a tunnel in Chicago under air com- 
pression, and had been attacked with numbness and weakness in the 
feet and legs, with occasional darting pains. He managed to work 
on, however, until some time later he experienced the same sensa- 
tions in the arms. His head felt "heavy," he had vertigo and more 
or less epigastric pain. He next acquired incontinence of urine and 
feces. He complained also of mental depression and lack of con- 
centration of mind. When seen four months later the same symp- 
toms persisted. 

Another patient whom I saw in the Presbyterian Hospital had 
paraplegia and complete suppression of urine, which lasted four 
days, when he died. 

Another patient seen in 1909 was attacked during a period of 
caisson work with severe pain radiating from the right hip down the 
leg which had lasted six months at the time the case was first seen. 

My colleague, the late Dr. Andrew H. Smith, reported a case 
seen, in 1894, in the Presbyterian Hospital of a caisson worker who 
had extensive purple mottling of the skin, which disappeared under 
friction, indicating vasomotor paresis. In addition were some true 
ecchymoses. 

Prognosis. Recovery from the milder symptoms of moderate 
pain and other sensory disturbances, vertigo, nausea, chilliness, etc., 
is usually prompt and complete within a short time under treat- 
ment. Complete paraplegia and suppression of urine may be re- 
covered from, even after the lapse of two or three days. In other 
cases recovery from paraplegia may be only partial, leaving a 
spastic type of paraplegia, and most of the cases of this type which 
do not improve in the medical lock linger along for several weeks 
while the myelitis is progressing, and finally succumb to static 
pneumonia or infection through bedsores or cystitis and pyelitis or 



AIE MODIFICATION 485 

pyonephrosis, following the repeated catheterization which is neces- 
sitated. 

One of my patients who entered Bellevue Hospital about two 
years ago had been working 400 feet below the surface of the Hud- 
son River, where the tunnel for the Catskill aqueduct crosses. He 
had worked under 4 atmospheres of air pressure and had complete 
paraplegia, with almost complete suppression of urine. His arms 
were unaffected and he had no constant pain when seen, but the legs 
were thrown into painful spasm when passively flexed. To my sur- 
prise, he made a complete recovery after a week, the urinary secre- 
tion being resumed on the second day. He had had 3 or 4 pre- 
vious severe attacks of the "bends," but, tempted by wages of six 
dollars to eight dollars a day, he insisted against advice on return- 
ing to work, which he should not have been permitted to do. 

Another patient, with complete paraplegia and retention of 
urine, gradually grew emaciated and died after 8 weeks of asthenia. 

Twenty years ago, before the use of the "medical lock" for re- 
compression, in the boring of an attempted tunnel under the Hud- 
son River, 12 deaths among half a hundred workmen took place, 
besides a number of non-fatal cases, some of which came to my 
service in the New York Hospital. 

In the building of the Ead's bridge across the Mississippi River 
at St. Louis many deep caissons were required. In the work 600 
men were employed, of whom 119 (20 per cent.) acquired com- 
pressed air illness, with 14 deaths among them. Von Schrb'tter col- 
lected from the literature 137 fatal cases reported between 1854 and 
1897. ("Die Luftdruckerkrankungen," Wien, 1900.) 

Dr. Frederick L. Keays, of my staff, in 1909, in the Researches 
of the Medical Department of the Cornell University Medical Col- 
lege, in the most complete treatise on this subject which has yet 
appeared, describes 3,692 cases, with 20 deaths, and many cases of 
permanent disability, among the 10,000 caisson workers who came 
under his observation, who were employed in four of the great river 
tunnels constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company the 
most extensive work of the kind ever undertaken under compressed 
air. 



486 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

On the other hand, Japp found, in 1909, among 330 employees 
in one of the East Kiver Tunnels, that with stage decompression 
combined with the exercise of walking experienced workmen ran 
very little risk. Under the new compulsory reporting law for occu- 
pational diseases there were reported 8 cases in the State of New 
York in the year 1911-12. 

Decompression Methods. There are two distinct methods of de- 
compression, (a) that of Haldane and (b) that advocated by Keays 
and the majority of those who have had large practical experience 
with workers in compressed air. These methods may be described 
respectively as (a) interrupted or "stage" and (b) continuous or 
uniform decompression. 

(a) STAGE DECOMPRESSION. Haldane's method of rapid par- 
tial half decompression and subsequent interrupted slow decompres- 
sion is illustrated diagrammatically under the heading, Divers, on 
page 496. This system he worked out theoretically, experimentally 
with goats, and then practically upon divers with great success. In 
applying it to caisson workers, with whom he has had less practical 
experience than Dr. Keays and others, he admits that the con- 
ditions are somewhat different, for in the diver saturation of the 
body with nitrogen, owing to the relatively short exposure, is always 
incomplete. In the caisson the pressures are usually, though not 
always, less high, but the duration of exposure is always longer, 2 
to 3 hours or more. Dr. Haldane said, in a lecture before the Royal 
Society of Arts in 1907, "Bearing in mind these circumstances, it 
seems desirable to adopt a somewhat slower rate of decompression 
in the case of caisson workers than in the case of divers, and to 
make the decompression more gradual toward the end" and "the 
slow part of the decompression then becomes theoretically very 
nearly uniform, so that a uniform rate may well be adopted." With 
only one additional atmosphere of pressure it is quite safe to de- 
compress in 3 minutes without any slow stage, for accidents under 
this pressure are very rare. To avoid injury to the ears, however, 
at least 3 minutes should be taken for this single additional atmos- 
phere of pressure reduction. With a higher pressure of, say, 55 Ibs. 
of absolute pressure, by Haldane's method the reduction should be 



AIR MODIFICATION 487 

to one-half or 27^ Ibs. absolute pressure in 3 minutes, followed by 
7 periods of 12^ minutes each, or 88 minutes after 3 hours of work. 
For 6 hours he would require 112 minutes for the second stage, or 
almost two hours. Where men return to work in a tunnel the same 
day for a second or third shift he suggests the construction of a large 
chamber kept at a low pressure, where they could wash, eat luncheon, 
etc., and save the time lost in emerging into normal air. The pres- 
sure in this chamber could be maintained at about ^ or \ an atmos- 
phere above normal. This would add construction expense, but in 
long tunnels with work extending over months, much of the work- 
men's time would be saved. 

Hill and Greenwood ("Caisson Sickness," Longmans, New 
York, 1912) compared Haldane's method with the uniform decom- 
pression method by experiment upon animals and found little or 
no advantage in his method in cases of long exposure to the pressure. 

(b) UNIFORM DECOMPRESSION. Keays' experiments are far 
more conclusive, having been conducted where about 1,000 men 
daily were employed for more than 500 days in the Pennsylvania 
tubes. One minute for each two pounds of pressure was the uni- 
form decompression rate, and he strongly advocates the uninter- 
rupted method. The difficulty of making workmen take sufficient 
time for safe decompression is very great, especially under low 
pressures. The French caisson physicians favor requiring 20 min- 
utes for both compression and decompression for each added atmos- 
phere, but practically up to two additional atmospheres the work- 
men insist on being released in 5 minutes. 

In January, 1912, a law was introduced in the New York State 
Legislature, having, among others, the following provisions con- 
trolling work in compressed air: (1) For absolute pressures up to 
28 Ibs. duration of labor must not exceed 8 hours a day, with at 
least one return to open air for half an hour; (2) between 28 and 
36 Ibs. absolute pressure work is limited to two daily periods of 3 
hours each, with one hour interval between; (3) between 36 and 42 
Ibs. work is limited to two daily periods of 2 hours each, with a 
2-hour interval; (4) between 42 and 46 Ibs. work is limited to two 
daily periods of 1^ hours each, with a 3-hour interval; (5) between 



488 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

46 and 50 Ibs. work is limited to two daily periods of one hour each, 
with 4 hours' interval; (6) work in pressures above 50 Ibs. is pro- 
hibited "except in case of emergency" ; (7) every workman in tun- 
nels must undergo decompression in a lock at the rate of 3 Ibs. every 
two minutes unless the work has been done at or above 36 Ibs., when 
the decompression rate shall be one pound per minute; (8) in cais- 
son work the decompression rate for work up to 10 Ibs. pressure is 
one minute, from 10 to 15 Ibs. 2 minutes, 15 to 20 Ibs. 5 minutes, 
20 to 25 Ibs. 10 minutes, 25 to 30 Ibs. 12 minutes, 30 to 36 Ibs. 15 
minutes, 36 to 40 Ibs. 20 minutes, 40 to 50 Ibs. 25 minutes; (9) a 
competent physician must be in attendance during the work, and all 
employees must pass a medical examination at the outset of work, 
and be reexamined after every period of absence exceeding 10 days ; 
(10) no alcoholic workman may be employed; (11) novices must 
begin with half-time work and be reexamined physically; (12) at 
intervals of 3 months' work each employee shall be reexamined ; (13) 
dressing rooms must be provided, heated, lighted and ventilated, 
with lockers, baths, hot and cold water and a sanitary toilet; (14) 
a medical lock shall be maintained in charge of a trained nurse; 
(15) double systems of air pipes and electric lighting are required. 
New York State is the only one thus far in which such provisions 
have been made. 

In the subaqueous work, during decompression, the air often 
becomes quite cold and foggy, which adds much to the objection the 
workmen have to prolonging the time. In the tunnel between New 
York City and Brooklyn, according to Walter I. Aims, heated air 
was supplied during decompression, which he believes contributed 
to the comparatively low rate of illness in that work. 

It is easy to write out formulas for the time required for decom- 
pression after exposure to air pressures of varying degree and dura- 
tion. It is quite another matter to compel workmen to follow them, 
and intelligent constant supervision of their work is most important. 

Prevention. CONCLUSIONS FORMULATED FROM THE PRECEDING 
GENERAL STATEMENTS. The longer the workman is employed in 
the caisson the more gas is absorbed by his blood. The greater the 
air pressure, the greater the danger from absorption. The quicker 



AIR MODIFICATION 489 

the release from the pressure the greater the danger. The greater 
the muscular fatigue, the greater the clanger. The more rapid the 
increase of pressure the greater the danger. It is dangerous to work 
in a caisson while having an empty stomach. The lower the external 
temperature on leaving the caisson, the greater the danger from 
chills and circulatory disturbance. Very stout workmen and any- 
one having weak lungs, weak heart or arteriosclerosis should posi- 
tively be excluded from caissons. Boys and men past 40 years of 
age and all alcoholic persons should be excluded positively from the 
work. 

An important precaution followed by Keays in the Pennsylvania 
tunnels has often been neglected elsewhere. This consists in sub- 
jecting all new caisson workers to a preliminary test, by exposing 
them to 30 Ibs. of pressure for 90 minutes without work and then 
decompressing them at the rate of 2 Ibs. per minute, or 15 minutes 
for the entire decompression period. Should any mild symptoms 
develop, such as slight pains or weakness in the legs, the workman 
is discarded as unfit. 

All caisson men should be thoroughly instructed as to the hazard 
of their work, and cautioned not only to be patient with slow decom- 
pression, but to refrain during their period of work from drink, 
over-fatigue and unhygienic modes of life of every kind. They 
should undergo thorough physical examination at least as often as 
once a week. 

The Austrian Government regulations are as follows: 

(1) Going into the caisson, at least 20 seconds must be allowed 
for each 0.1 atmosphere of pressure increase. 

(2) Coming out of the caisson, for every 0.1 atmosphere of 
increased pressure up to 30 Ibs. absolute pressure, 1 minute must be 
allowed, and for every 0.1 atmosphere thereafter, 2 minutes' time 
for decompression. 

(3) Only 5 persons are allowed simultaneously to undergo 
compression and decompression. [Which is impossible where tun- 
nel work is conducted upon a large scale.] 

(4) Pressure must be uniformly increased and diminished and 
fresh air must be supplied. 



490 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

(5) On emerging the workmen must go to the barracks, take 
warm soup, and keep in motion for 15 minutes. 

Working in marl and asbestos requires special precautions as 
to ventilation. 

Treatment. In all serious cases the patient should be returned 
at once to the medical lock, which should be provided wherever many 
caisson workers are employed. Barracks for the workmen should 
be near at hand, for everything depends for successful treatment 
with the medical lock upon returning the patient to it as promptly 
as possible. If he is attacked by symptoms after a long walk to 
his home, it may be too late to benefit him by recompression. 

THE MEDICAL AiK-LocK. This structure, first used for recom- 
pression by E. W. Moir in the Hudson River tunnel more than 20 
years ago, is placed on the surface of the ground and operated inde- 
pendently of the caisson. It is used where extensive works require 
the employment of a large number of men, but under other conditions 
the victims of compressed air illness may temporarily be returned 
to the regular caisson and then slowly decompressed. The air lock 
is a steel cylinder (Fig. 93) having an inside diameter of about 6 
feet, and a length of about a dozen feet. It is permanently closed 
at one end, the other being fitted with a door opening inward to 
admit the patients, for, in emergencies, several may be placed within 
at a time. A transverse median door divides the interior into two 
compartments, so that, with the patient in the further one, a physi- 
cian may enter and leave the outer compartment, and through it 
gain access to the patient, who thus may be kept under uniform 
positive pressure as long as desired. A system of pipes and valves 
permits the fresh air supply and the pressure to be regulated either 
from within or without the lock. In the patients' chamber are 
placed cots, a telephone, electric light, clock, pressure gauge, a 
thermometer and an electric heater. The lock is also supplied with 
glass windows, like a calorimeter, so that the patient may be kept 
under constant observation. The gauge and thermometer also may 
be seen through the windows. 

On being placed in the lock, the pressure is promptly raised to 
that under which the patient has been at work, and after an interval 



is reduced by a pound a minute, or more slowly in urgent cases. In 
such cases massage and passive movements of the limbs are made by 
an attendant, who also conducts artificial respiration for unconscious 
patients. 

In Dr. Keays's experiments with the lock he tried Haldane's 




FIG. 93. MEDICAL AIR LOCK FOR RECOMPRESSION IN CASES OF THE "BENDS." 
This is in a building outside of the tunnel. 

partial decompression plan, with good results, decompressing sud- 
denly down to about one atmosphere above normal and thereafter 
very slowly. In some cases it was necessary to repeat the treatment 
3 or 4 times. In 3,278 cases with pain he obtained relief in about 
90 per cent. When the patient is able he should exercise his limbs 
while decompression is going on, so as to promote activity of cir- 
culation. The details of treatment of these cases are thus sum- 
marized by Keays : 

"In 80 cases with symptoms referable to the central nervous 
system the results were as follows : 



492 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

"Four cases of hemiplegia were all cleared up permanently by 
recompression ; of 36 cases of sensory disturbance, 34 were relieved 
by recompression, 2 refused the medical lock and were improved by 
medical treatment; of 34 cases of motor disturbance, partial or 
complete paralysis of the legs, 23 were benefited by recompression 
and either cleared up at once or recovered later, in 11 recompression 
caused no improvement, and of these 5 ultimately died, 3 had perma- 
nent spastic paraplegia, and 3 were lost sight of; of 10 cases of 
sensory and motor disturbance, 9 were permanently relieved, and 
one was improved, but the final result was not learned. 

"In 197 cases showing vertigo, with or without vomiting, pain, 
prostration and dyspnea, 108 had complete relief from recompres- 
sion, 82 had partial relief from recompression, and 7 refused the 
medical lock. 

"In 60 cases of dyspnea and sense of constriction of the chest, 
all cleared up with one recompression except two which required 
a second recompression. 

"In 17 cases of partial or complete unconsciousness and collapse, 
8 were cured or relieved by one or more recompressions, but 9 had 
little or no relief and died. Oxygen given to several of these severe 
cases during decompression afforded no appreciable benefit." 

As soon as a patient shows any signs of compressed air illness 
such as chills, circulatory disturbances, dyspnea, weakness in the 
legs, painful cramps and dysesthesia or paresthesia, he is to be 
treated by application of warmth and stimulation. In winter a 
fire should be kept burning in the dressing room adjoining the cais- 
son and warm dry clothing should be supplied, for the danger of 
acquiring pneumonia or nephritis is much enhanced by going into 
a cold atmosphere with wet, soiled clothing. 

T. K. Thomson found from his own experience with the "bends," 
which he had twice from working in the caissons in the Harlem 
River silt, that hot coffee induced profuse perspiration and, tem- 
porarily only, relieved the pains in the back and legs. A hot bath 
had similar temporary effect. He next tried mild electric shocks, 
which gave temporary relief, but failed on a second occasion. 

Care should be exercised to examine the bladder, for there may 



AIR MODIFICATION 493 

be paralysis, which results in great distention and must be relieved 
by catheterization once in 6 or 8 hours. If, on the other hand, 
there is suppression of urine, the patient should be given a hot 
pack to induce perspiration, with a large draught of hot fluid, such 
as lemonade or the "imperial drink." A five-grain dose of theosin 
may be prescribed and dry cups applied over the region of the 
kidneys. Paraplegia should be treated, after a few days, with mas- 
sage, passive movements and the galvanic current. 

DIVERS 

Nature of the Industry. Divers, like caisson workers, are sub- 
ject to compressed air illness. They are much employed in the navy 
to examine the hulls of sunken vessels, and as workmen to inspect 
the foundation piers of bridges, submarine mines, etc., and one of 
the largest industries employing them is the collection of sponges. 
The latter industry is mainly conducted by Greeks and Turks along 
the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean Islands and north coast 
of Egypt, but it is also followed in the Gulf of Mexico and along 
the coast of Cuba and the Bahamas. In Florida the headquarters 
of these fishermen is at Key West and Tarpon Springs, where, in 
1900, 418,125 pounds of sponges were brought from neighboring 
waters. 

Deep-sea diving is conducted by wearing an apparatus called 
a "scaphander," consisting of a helmet attached to a metal corselet, 
which in turn is fastened to a rubber suit made to fit the body so 
tightly as to exclude water. Only the hands are free, passing 
through elastic cuffs. The helmet is connected at its back to a tube 
through which compressed air is supplied either from an air pump 
on shore or carried on a vecsel. (Fig. 94.) The exhaled air es- 
capes into the water through a spring valve whenever the pressure 
within the helmet becomes slightly greater than that of the sur- 
rounding water at whatever depth the diver may happen to be. 
Every 10 meters of sea water, or approximately 33 feet of depth, 
correspond to an increase of one atmosphere of air pressure, or 
about 15 Ibs. per square inch. For fresh water the ratio is 34 



494 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

feet of water to one atmosphere of pressure. If the air be not 
compressed in the proper ratio, breathing becomes impossible. 

The diver also carries a signal rope or telephone with a receiver 
in the helmet. The air pipe is also useful for signaling. As he

descends by carrying a weight, the water pressure becomes greater 
and the air pressure must be increased. When he is ready to 
ascend he leaves the weight, gives a signal, and is pulled slowly to 
the surface. If he comes out too quickly, and the air pressure is 
too suddenly reduced, he is subject to similar conditions with the 
caisson worker, but with the difference that he is more subject in 
the confined air space to carbon dioxid poisoning. For some pur- 
poses a large diving bell is employed in which the diver sits and 
works on the bottom of the river or sea, the compressed air escaping 
around the rim of the bell. 



AIR MODIFICATION 495 

The operation of sponge fishing was originally conducted by 
naked divers who became so expert through training, and in early 
Greece, often through several generations of heredity, that they 
could reach a depth of over 200 feet and remain two minutes below 
the surface. Some, in fact, could remain as long as 2f minutes, 
according to C. Flegel, of Vienna, who has made a special study of 
the subject. As the demand for sponges increased it became neces- 
sary to remain longer under water to gather them in depths where 
they cannot be reached by grappling hooks, dragnets, or ordinary 
diving. Hence the diving suit came into requisition for the pur- 
pose, and, although used for more than forty years previously in 
Greece and Turkey, it was not introduced into Florida until 1905. 
The use of this apparatus is quite harmless at depths within 50 feet, 
but at much greater depths many fatalities have occurred from com- 
pressed air illness. In foreign countries where the use of both 
diving suits and pumps are often entrusted to careless or incompe- 
tent men, according to Flegel, "the yearly mortality among sponge 
fishermen in the diving apparatus is about 20 per cent., and the 
seriously and slightly diseased reach annually 25 per cent." He 
also estimates that in 42 years there have been 5,300 deaths from 
the use of scaphanders and 2,300 cases of serious disablement. Flegel 
quotes Petros Zotos, commander of a Grecian man-of-war detailed 
to control the diving industry, as asserting that, of 900 Greek divers 
using 140 scaphanders, more than 100 die in a single summer's 
sponge cruise. Samos and Turkey have laws prohibiting the use 
of the scaphander for this murderous purpose, but the United States 
have not yet progressed so far, and merely prohibit its use in certain 
months of the year, and in depths of less than 50 feet, in which the 
sponges are easily obtainable by other methods. 

Symptoms. The symptoms produced by abuse of the scaphander 
are substantially the same described for the caisson workers on page 
480, and the etiology of the disease through the production of air 
emboli is identical. There are, however, two additional factors, 
first, that the suit worn compresses the legs so tightly (in order not to 
inflate and thus buoy the diver up) as to modify the distribution of 
the blood and sometimes cause subsequent gangrene, and, second, that

the diver, receiving a comparatively small volume of air, suffers 
more from its vitiation. At depths of 70 to 90 feet there is con- 
siderable dyspnea, and from 
that pressure onward the 
distress increases and work 
becomes increasingly diffi- 
cult. This distress was for- 
merly referred to the pres- 
sure exerted by the water 
on the body, but Dr. J. S. 
Haldane, of Oxford, has 
shown conclusively that it is 
due solely to the increase in 
CO 2 pressure. It will not 
do merely to maintain a 
proper pressure within the 
helmet, but the volume of 
air supplied must increase 
proportionately with the 
depth, to keep it fit for 
breathing. When this con- 
dition is properly met, Hal- 
dane has shown, through 
two officers of the British 
Navy who experimented at 
the greatest depth attained 
by divers, 210 feet (7$ at- 
mospheres of pressure), that 
they not only tfould breathe 
comfortably, but could de-

scend rapidly. 

Unskilled divers or be- 
ginners may become stupefied by the CO 2 , and it is equally danger- 
ous to let them down and draw them up too quickly. 

In 1907 the British Admiralty Committee, headed by Haldane, 
reported upon the conditions to which divers are subjected in deep 



AIR MODIFICATION 497 

water and pointed out the danger of CO 2 poisoning from lack of 
adequate air. Haldane maintains that rapid decompression up to 
one-half the maximum pressure employed results in no harm pro- 
vided the remaining half of the increased pressure is very slowly 
brought to normal, so as to give plenty of time for the circulating 
blood to discharge through the lungs the volume of gas which it has 
been made to absorb by the pressure. 

The intensity of the symptoms of the diver's illness depend upon 
the depth at which he works, the volume of air supplied, the dura- 
tion of his ascent, and such unfavorable conditions as fatigue, eat- 
ing heavily, etc. Hemorrhages in various parts of the body are 
quite common among divers, also deafness, vertigo, gastric disorders, 
permanent lameness from paralysis of the legs, and paralysis of the 
bladder. 

Prevention. The Russian Government maintains a diving school 
at Cronstadt for its fleet, so that familiarity with the use of diving 
apparatus may lessen its hazards, although divers in the navy usually 
work under much more favorable conditions than do sponge fisher- 
men, being under no stress of competition. The British Navy also 
maintains a diving school. 

In 1904 Queen Olga of Greece founded a hospital in Tripoli for 
the treatment of divers, because there are more than 600 machine 
divers who are Greeks. 

No one should be permitted to use a scaphander who has any 
organic defect of the heart, lungs or ears, or who is beyond the 
limits of 20 to 40 years of age. 

Dr. Katsaras, professor of nervous diseases in the University 
of Athens, has formulated the following rules for divers: 

Duration of work should depend on depth of water, as follows : 

(1) 10 to 15 fathoms, 1 hour 
15 " 20 " i " 

20 " 25 " 10 minutes 
25 " 28 " 5 " 
28" 30 " 3 " 
30 " 32 " 1 minute 

(2) In rising, stop one minute after each 2 fathoms. 



498 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

(3) Avoid diving more than once a day. 

(4) Do not dive while having a cold or full stomach or in- 

testines. 

(5) Avoid fatigue and use of alcohol. 

Two and a half hours should be the maximum limit per diem 
for any diver to work. 

The deeper a diver descends the more air must be pumped 
through his helmet to prevent asphyxiation from his exhaled carbon 
dioxid. Dr. Leonard Hill has recommended the carrying on the 
back of the diver of a receptacle filled with caustic soda through 
which air from the helmet may be aspirated to absorb the C0 2 . He 
has also devised a self-acting diving outfit carrying cylinders of 50 
per cent, compressed oxygen gas and a caustic soda chamber. This 
renders the diver independent of air pump and tubes, a great ad- 
vantage in climbing about in the interior of sunken vessels, where 
air tubes are liable to become twisted or cut off. Such apparatus, 
Hill claims, may be used for half an hour at a depth of 100 feet. 

Hill has furthermore devised a decompression chamber for 
divers' use. It has two compartments, one open at the bottom to 
the sea, the second opening by a manhole only into the first. After 
quitting work the diver climbs into the first chamber, which is 
lowered to the bottom of the sea, and from it climbs through into 
the second chamber. The entire apparatus with the man inside is 
then hoisted on the deck of a boat and slow decompression is made. 

Haldane's method of prevention of compressed air illness - in 
divers is that of rapid decompression, i. e., rapid raising toward the 
surface until half the maximum pressure is reached. The remaining 
half is reduced by interrupted stages, bringing the diver up a few feet, 
stopping a few minutes, raising him again, etc. By this work, for 
ordinary depths down to 120 feet, the diver may be brought to the 
surface safely by taking half an hour for the process. The original 
system required the diver to descend and ascend at the uniform rate 
of about 5 feet per minute, but Haldane recommends quick descent, 
quick ascent until half the maximum pressure used is reached, then 
slow, interrupted ascent. As tried experimentally with animals and 
practically with divers in the British Navy, this method has proved 



AIR MODIFICATION 



499 



a very successful preventive of "diver's palsy" and the other phe- 
nomena of diver's illness. 

The reasons given for this method are principally two. First, 
the diver is exposed to high air pressure for comparatively short 
periods, so that his body becomes less completely saturated with nitro- 
gen than it does in tunnel or caisson work where the exposure is 
longer. Hence, to slowly reduce a high pressure in the diving ap- 
paratus means that the diver is still absorbing nitrogen, although the 
pressure is all the time being reduced. It is therefore a gain to 
bring him as quickly as may be safe back to a low pressure under 
which he absorbs less gas. To take him out at once would be to 
liberate the absorbed nitrogen too freely and cause paralysis or death. 
To take him out halfway, or to half-pressure, is a safe means, as 
proven both practically and experimentally. The second reason 
given is a considerable saving of total time spent in the water. 

The following table and the diagrams on page 496 elucidate Hal- 
dane's system more fully:

RAREFIED AIR 

Balloon ascensions, and recently aviation, give opportunity for 
study of the occupational effects of rarefied air upon professional 
"airmen" effects first described by Da Costa in the fifteenth cen- 
tury under the name of "Malades montagnes," or "mountain sick- 
ness." Many fatalities have occurred from too rapid entrance into 
rarefied air, and, in 1875, Tissandier and several comrades made a 
fatal balloon ascension from Paris. In rapid air ascensions a height 



500 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

of 9,000 feet or more may be attained in half an hour or less, and the 
return may he made in 5 to 7 minutes. From 20 to 30 F. differ- 
ence in temperature may simultaneously be experienced. These con- 
ditions necessarily profoundly affect the respiration and circulation 
and, in addition, in aviation is the strain of physical and mental 
effort. As the ascent is made the pulse is quickened and respiration 
becomes shallow and rapid. Symptoms which further have been ob- 
served are vertigo, tinnitus aurium, deafness and frontal headache 
(at 4,500 feet), acute desire for micturition, and chilliness. On 
landing there are irregularities in reflexes and voluntary motions 
resulting from fatigue and nerve tension, the body feels warm, the 
face is flushed, the eyes may be painful, blood pressure is increased, 
and there is tachycardia. Drowsiness may also be a prominent 
symptom. Visual hallucinations have been reported, with loss of the 
sense of orientation. Nausea is less common among aviators than 
mountain climbers. The latter, as well as balloonists, on ascending 
to great heights, may have hemorrhages, rarely fatal, from the nose, 
bronchi, and sometimes the eyes and ears. None of these effects 
appear to be permanent and considerable immunity is acquired in 
time, as it is also possessed by some persons originally. 

AIR CONCUSSION 

The effect of sudden air concussion, arising from blasts, boiler 
or other explosions, big gun firing, etc., is often serious. One or 
both ear drums may be ruptured, hemorrhage may take place into 
the middle ear, labyrinthine injury may follow, temporary uncon- 
sciousness may be produced, and the victim may be knocked down 
and injured by cerebral concussion or otherwise. Miners, quarry- 
men and gunners are those most liable to such injuries. Permanent 
deafness in one or both ears may rarely result, tinnitus and head- 
ache or earache may be produced by certain sounds, but complete or 
partial recovery usually takes place after healing of the ruptured 
membrana tympani. 

Dr. E. P. Fowler, of New York, has studied the result of the 
alternate sudden compression and rarefaction of the air caused by 



AIR MODIFICATION 501 

the rush of trains through the tunnels leading from Manhattan 
Tsland into Long Island and New Jersey. 

Although the maximum depth of these tunnels is not great, 
barometric pressures' are constantly varying with the speed of the 
train, the extreme range being inch of mercury pressure, or ^ Ib. 
to the square inch, with constant oscillations and variations in the dif- 
ferent cars. Suddenly diminished pressure tends to draw the walls 
of the Eustachian tube together, whereas increased pressure may 
separate them. Hence the former produces more blocking of the 
outlet of the middle ear, and acuteness of hearing is more diminished 
temporarily thereby. "Especially is this the case if the ears are 
exposed first to an increase and then immediately to a sudden diminu- 
tion in air pressure." 

To the normal ear no harm results from such changes in motor- 
men and guards or others constantly exposed to them, but preexist- 
ing tubal or other ear disease may be accentuated. 

To lessen the deleterious effects, one should close the nostrils, 
attempt expiration through the closed nostrils, and simultaneously 
swallow, thereby increasing the nasopharyngeal air pressure and 
forcing air into the Eustachian tubes. In the vertigo and earache 
produced by such injuries as boiler explosions, etc., treatment with 
pilocarpin often gives relief. 

CONFINED AIR 

In certain occupations, as in cleaning flues, boilers, vats, tanks, 
etc., it is necessary for the workman to remain for some time in an 
exceedingly confined space. In so doing he is exposed not only to 
the deleterious effects of whatever noxious dusts, gases or fumes may 
be present, but to rapid exhaustion of the oxygen present and pollu- 
tion of the air with his own exhalations. In a series of experi- 
ments in which men were kept in a small air-tight chamber Hill 
found that it is "the heat, moisture and stillness of the air which 
cause discomfort and fatigue, and not the excess of carbon dioxid 
exhaled or deficit in the oxygen of the air breathed." By intro- 
ducing an electric fan in the chamber, and thus keeping the confined 



502 DISEASES DUE TO HAEMFUL ENTIEONMENT 

air in constant motion, it was found that much of the discomfort 
and fatigue was mitigated. This was true when the carbon dioxid 
percentage was as high as 4 or 5. 

Personal "comfort," however, is an entirely unreliable criterion 
by which to estimate the fitness of air to breathe. Conditions of 
anemia produced, of blood pressure, etc., are far more important. 
This topic is elaborated further in the section on Ventilation of the 
Workroom, page 106. 



H. TEMPERATURE MODIFICATIONS 

EXCESSIVE HEAT AND MOISTURE; EXTREME COLD 

The effects of temperature vary greatly in accordance with the 
dryness or moisture and motion of the atmosphere, suddenness of 
temperature changes, and duration of exposure. Temporary expos- 
ure to dry air may be endured up to 150 F. or more. In the stoke 
holes of the steel warships when in the tropics the temperature may 
rise to 130 or 140 F., and the stokers may endure a two-hour 
shift, provided they perspire freely and motion be imparted to the 
air to accelerate evaporation from the body, which is almost com- 
pletely stripped. Other classes of workmen who have to endure 
great dry heaf almost constantly are puddlers and foundrymen, pot- 
tery bakers, glass-blowers, bakers, cooks, miners, workers with elec- 
tric furnaces, roofers, and workers in asphalt paving who labor in a 
hot sun. Apart from insolation, which is described upon page 507, 
these types of laborers are subject mainly to rheumatism, bronchitis, 
and chronic nephritis, which appear to be due more to the sudden 
cooling off of the body, which checks perspiration and affects the vaso- 
motor system, than to the heat itself. Hot, moist, still air checks 
evaporation from the skin and taxes the cooling mechanism of the 
body. Blood goes to the relaxed vessels of the body surface to be 
cooled that, should go to brain and muscle, hence the physical and 
mental languor which ensue under such conditions. 

Painful muscular cramps in the legs and abdomen are some- 
times experienced by workers in intense heat. Such a case (with 



TEMPERATURE MODIFICATIONS 503 

reference to others) is described by Dr. L. Clendening, of Kansas 
City (Jour. Amer. Med. Assoc., May T, 1910). The patients are 
usually cooks in Pullman dining cars who, in summer, are exposed 
to great heat, having to lean over ranges in a very confined space. 




FIG. 96. WITHDRAWING MOLTEN METAL IN A FOUNDRY. Exposure to exces- 
sive heat and light. Hazards: burns, injuries to eyes, dermatitis, rheu- 
matism. 



The condition has a tendency to recur with increasing frequency. 
Excessive heat may cause localized burning of the skin, as of the 
face and hands when molten metal is withdrawn from a foundry 
furnace. (Fig. 96.) 

In facing excessive heat, as in foundries, glass furnaces, electric 
furnaces and smelting works, glasses do not serve, although colored 
blue and red goggles may be worn until the heat is very great, say 
over 1,000 F. Above that temperature asbestos masks should be

ting of aluminum or galvanized iron. 

Workers in great heat become gradually accustomed to it, so that

they can endure temperatures which to novices would appear almost 
insupportable. 

Exposure to constantly alternating extremes of temperature, as 
in going in and out of baking ovens, cold storage plants, etc., may 
give rise to attacks of cholera morbus, with excessive watery diarrhea

and intestinal cramps, particularly if the workman has eaten indis- 
creetly or drunk too much cold water besides. 

Excessive moisture is encountered by many classes of workmen, 
especially pottery clay mixers, paper makers, fishermen, canners 
(Fig. 97), oystermen, and flax spinners. In sugar refineries the

temperature is sometimes 95 F. wher.e the humidity reaches 96. 
Heat and moisture combined check perspiration and oppress the 
breathing. The kidneys are overworked and the nervous functions 
are depressed. For these reasons a lesser degree of moist heat than 
of dry heat is endurable for continued work. Examples of this type 
of exposure are found among caisson workers in under-river tunnels, 
damp mines, hothouses, laundries, tanneries (Fig. 98), dyeworks, 
flax mills, and many other occupations. The cleaning out of many 
tanks and vats, and all occupations in which much steam is liberated 
indoors, involve similar exposure. The workmen are liable to chronic 



506 DISEASES DUE TO HAKMFUL ENVIKONMENT 

rheumatism, chronic bronchitis, and disturbances of the circulation 
sometimes occur. 

Occupational exposure to excessive cold is experienced by ice- 
men, makers of artificial ice and workers in cold storage plants. 
Among such workmen rheumatism is common, and also neuritis and 
chronic nephritis. Girls are sometimes employed in the trimming 
rooms of lard packing plants at a temperature below refrigeration. 

Cold, damp indoor air chills the body surface and tends to pro- 
duce visceral congestion. Expenditure of body heat is increased, 
resisting power of the organism is lowered, and such infections as 
pneumonia, tuberculosis and catarrh are very easily acquired. 

Exposure to sudden extremes of outdoor temperature affect par- 
ticularly those classes of employees whose occupation keeps them for 
long hours under conditions in which they cannot always protect 
themselves from sudden temperature changes often combined with 
wetting. Such are fishermen, sailors, motormen and drivers. They 
are prone to rheumatism, chronic nephritis, chronic bronchitis and 
catarrhal pneumonia. 

Prevention. Prevention of the ills arising from exposure to tem- 
perature extremes consists mainly in the avoidance of too sudden 
changes from heat to cold, the protection of the perspiring body 
from cold and drafts by thorough drying and friction of the skin, 
and putting on of woolen undergarments to absorb moisture and act 
as non-conductors. Attention should also be given to the urine, and, 
if it becomes scanty and highly colored, more water should be drunk. 

The British legal standards for the air in textile fabric mills, in 
rooms such as those where hackling, carding, net spinning, etc., are 
conducted, besides prescribing exhaust ventilation, order as follows: 

"1. In every room in which persons are employed the arrange- 
ments shall be such that during working hours the proportion of 
carbonic acid in the air of. the room shall not exceed 20 volumes per 
10,000 volumes of air at any time when gas or oil is used for light- 
ing (or within one hour thereafter) or 12 volumes per 10,000 when 
electric light is used (or within one hour thereafter), or 9 volumes 
per 10,000 at any other time. 

"2. The temperature shall not fall below 50 F. and no person 



TEMPERATURE MODIFICATIONS 507 

employed shall be exposed to a direct draft from any air inlet, or 
to any draft at a temperature of less than 50 degrees. 

"3. The humidity of the atmosphere shall not at any time be 
such that the difference between the readings of the wet and dry 
bulb thermometers is less than 2 degrees." 

INSOLATION 

Insolation or sunstroke results from a combination of prolonged 
high temperature with excessive atmospheric humidity. It is an occu- 
pational disease in the sense that it is avoidable by anyone whose occu- 
pation does not compel him to endure the deleterious conditions which 
produce it. It is true that children without occupation may have it, 
but usually only those of the working class, living in unhygienic 
tenements. Sunstroke, moreover, is not necessarily due to direct 
exposure to the sun's rays, but to the peculiar "lifelessness" of the 
air in prolonged periods of hot humidity; for the same or greater 
degrees of heat and moisture are repeatedly endured in various 
industries for short intervals, but daily for a long time, without 
detriment to health. It is quite possible that there are properties 
in atmospheric air which are not fully determinable by present in- 
struments of precision. (See Ventilation Experiments, page 105.) 

Insolation affects chiefly metal roofers, stokers, foundrymen and 
puddlers, cooks, layers of asphalt pavement, street cleaners working 
upon superheated pavements, and the like. It is always greatly 
intensified among alcoholic subjects, and, in fact, the most serious 
cases are usually met with among hard working but chronically alco- 
holic men. Among women, excepting cooks and laundresses, true 
insolation is not common, being in the proportion of 1 to 14, as com- 
pared with men, nor is it usually observed among the well-to-do, 
who can take life less strenuously during heated terms. Direct 
exposure to the sun's rays is by no means essential for the produc- 
tion of insolation, for it occurs also among those working indoors, as 
in foundries, stoke holes of the hot steel warships when in tropical 
climates, and in the kitchens, often underground, of large hotels dur- 
ing periods of protracted humidity. Contributing factors, besides 



508 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

alcoholism, are overwork, overeating, sexual excesses and debauchery 
of any kind. Lack of abundant fresh water for drinking and bath- 
ing is another factor, such as may affect troops on forced marches, 
carrying heavy equipment over dusty roads. Negroes are almost 
entirely exempt. 

Morbid Anatomy. After death the left ventricle is found empty 
and in systole, but the right ventricle is engorged with venous blood. 
Subpleural and pericardial hemorrhages may be found. The late 
Ira van Gieson described in the brain and cord, neurons exhibiting 
acute parenchymatous degeneration. Such changes are marked in 
the anterior gray horns of the cord and the Purkinje cells of the 
cerebellum. The cell nuclei are shriveled, or sometimes absent. 
Similar changes are produced by other acute auto-intoxications and 
metallic poisons. The liver and kidneys may exhibit parenchymatous 
degeneration. The blood is thick and dark, showing as much as 125 
per cent, of hemoglobin, with increase in both erythrocytes and 
leukocytes. The red cells also may be misshapen. The serum, per- 
spiration and urine are all highly toxic to animals ; for the disease is 
a definite auto-intoxication produced primarily by checking of nor- 
mal processes of elimination, marked depression of the nervous sys- 
tem and altered metabolism. 

Symptoms. After a few days and nights of extreme heat and 
humidity of the atmosphere, or after a single exposure sometimes of 
a few hours to these conditions, the patient complains of headache 
and malaise. Suddenly, often at night, he becomes comatose or 
sometimes maniacally delirious. .The urine is scanty, and among 
preliminary symptoms may be vertigo, thirst, a quick pulse, and a 
temperature of 100 to 101 F. Vomiting and constipation are 
present. The temperature rapidly rises to great height. I have 
seen a large number of recoveries after a brief period of body tem- 
perature of 111 F., and a few after 112 F. One case at the 
Presbyterian Hospital ended in recovery after a rectal temperature 
of 115 F., and in 1896 a patient died in my service at the New 
York Hospital after sustaining for some time a temperature of 
117.8 F. The latter temperature is incompatible with prolongation 
of life, as heat rigor of the muscles occurs at a slightly higher de- 



TEMPERATUEE MODIFICATIONS 509 

gree (120 F.). Special thermometers must be procured for re- 
cording them, as the ordinary clinical thermometer does not register 
so high. In robust persons coma does not usually supervene before 
the temperature reaches 104 or 105 F., but in feeble or elderly 
subjects it may appear at a much lower degree. The delirium may 
be of homicidal or suicidal type. The urine becomes suppressed, 
blood pressure is high, and death often results, with edema of the 
lungs. In favorable cases under treatment the maximum temper- 
ature is sustained only a few moments, and the rate of fall may be 
at 2 or 3 F. every 15 minutes. When it has fallen to normal or 
slightly above normal consciousness is regained, the pulse improves, 
edema disappears, and recovery may take place. More often, how- 
ever, after very high temperatures above 106 or 107 F. there 
is a return of the rise of temperature later in the day or on the fol- 
lowing day to 102 or 103 F., and a mild remittent fever may last 
for a few days or a week. In reducing the body temperature by ex- 
ternal cold it may go down so rapidly as to become subnormal, when 
the patient goes into collapse and stimulants and hot applications may 
be required. It is best, therefore, to desist from cold applications 
as soon as the temperature in sthenic cases has fallen to 102 F. 

Sequelae. Sequelae consist of weakness and inability to con- 
centrate the mind for some time, or exercise the memory. Increased 
susceptibility to heat ic persistent, sometimes through life. Anemia, 
peripheral neuritis, encephalitis and dementia have all been ob- 
served in exceptional cases. Delusional and other insanities have 
followed in about 4 per cent, of the most severe cases. 

Prognosis. Prognosis is fair in direct proportion to the prompt- 
ness with which treatment can be applied and the length of time the 
high temperature has lasted. It is made many times worse by a 
previous state of alcoholism. Even very robust persons, if alcoholic, 
succumb much oftcner than less strong non-alcoholic subjects. In a 
fulminant type of the disease death may take place in an hour or two 
in convulsions or coma. Alexander Lambert collected data of 520 
cases treated in the New York Hospital in August, 1896, with a mor- 
tality of 25 per cent. Rarely patients pass into a typhoidal state 
and die from asthenia after two or three weeks. 



510 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

Diagnosis. Uremic coma presents albuminuria, thickened ar- 
teries and usually edema of the extremities and advanced anemia, 
constituting an entirely different blood picture. The temperature, 
moreover, may remain normal and rarely is above 105 F. 

Apoplexy presents focal symptoms such, as paralyses, contrac- 
tures and irregularity of the pupils. At the onset there is no increase 
in temperature. A temperature of 106 or 107 F., coming on 
suddenly without chill, is almost certainly due to insolation. 

Prevention. The workman during heated terms should live care- 
fully, eat moderately, avoiding much meat, and take no alcoholic 
beverages at all. He should drink abundant fluid, such as plain 
cool water, acid lemonade or oatmeal water. Ice water should not 
be drunk. He should protect the head while in the sun by a light- 
weight hat with a good air space above the head, and he may lay a 
wet cloth or large green, moist cabbage leaf beneath the hat. Clothing 
should be as light as possible and cool sponge or plunge baths should 
be taken night and morning. It is much more sensible to rise early, 
do one's hardest work in the coolest part of the day, resting 3 or 4 
hours in the hottest period, say from 12 to 3, or later, as is done in 
the tropics, but insolation conditions occur so irregularly in the 
insolation belt of the United States that it is difficult to adapt 
conditions of work to temporary emergencies and rearrange hours. 
Labor laws and labor union customs do not provide for such, con- 
tingencies. 

Treatment. The patient should be removed to the shade and as 
cool a place as possible, stripped and douched with cold water from 
head to foot. He may be rubbed also vigorously with cakes of ice 
and a towel wet with, iced water should be kept upon the head. 
Every five minutes the rectal temperature should be recorded. My 
favorite method is to fill a common garden watering pot with ice 
water and pour the water over the patient's body from a height of 
3 or 4 feet. .This process should be accompanied by constant vigor- 
ous rubbing of the skin to promote capillary circulation, prevent 
collapse and obtain a good reaction. The mechanical shock to the 
cutaneous nerves of so many small jets of water combined with the 
sudden cold and friction often will arouse a patient from deep coma. 



TEMPERATURE MODIFICATIONS 511 

Another method less well adapted for emergencies, except in hospi- 
tals, is to put the patient in a tub of cold water and rub him vigor- 
ously with ice, turning him frequently to rub the back and all parts 
of the body. Two or three persons are needed to conduct the rub- 
bing, for it is most important, and without it there is danger of col- 
lapse. As the temperature of the body nears 103 F. the efforts 
may be relaxed and safely suspended at 102 F. Subsequently a 
dose of croton oil, TTI ii, should be given and a stimulating enema 
of castor oil, i, and turpentine, *ss, in hot soap suds. As soon as 
possible the patient should be made to drink water. In cases with 
high tension and tendency to convulsions or maniacal delirium, the 
patient should be bled about 16 ozs. Threatened pulmonary edema 
should be treated as described on page 154. After apparent recov- 
ery the patient should be closely watched and the temperature ob- 
served every hour, for in some cases a fatal relapse with secondary 
high rise of temperature may take place. 

HEAT EXHAUSTION 

This condition may affect workmen who are feeble or old, and is 
due to similar causes with sunstroke, but the temperature is only 
slightly elevated (100-101 F.), or it may be subnormal. The 
pulse is feeble and sometimes abnormally slow. There are cold per- 
spiration, a tendency to vertigo, syncope, nausea and vomiting. 
There are also muscular prostration, a tendency to somnolence, and 
semi-coma or mild delirium. The urine is scanty and may show 
traces of albumin. 

Prognosis. Recovery is usual, but the very aged may succumb 
and die in asthenia. Recovery is often greatly protracted perhaps 
for several weeks. 

Treatment. Treatment should be by rest, cool air, and simple 
cardiac stimulants such as aromatic spirit of ammonia or camphor 
water. Patients who once have suffered from either insolation or 
heat exhaustion are quite often rendered -liable to subsequent attacks 
from comparatively slight degrees of exposure to fatigue during con- 
ditions of prolonged atmospheric depression. 



512 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

HI. LIGHT MODIFICATIONS 
EXCESSIVE LIGHT 

ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE X-RAY 

Electric light and X-ray burns differ from ordinary burns in 
their slower development, less immediate and violent pain and very 
protracted healing. The tissues are destroyed to a considerable 
depth, and bones which are near the surface, like those of the 
cranium, may have the outer layers necrosed. In some cases of 
extensive burn the lesion is painless, in others the pain is constant 
and severe. Burns of the skin of the hands may leave them hyper- 
sensitive for years, especially toward changes in temperature and 
wetting with antiseptic solutions. With all these forms of light 
irritation, superficial redness is followed by dermatitis, exfoliation 
of the skin and finally ulceration which may extend to muscle and 
bone beneath. Suppuration, unless the wound becomes independ- 
ently infected, does not follow. Maintenance of an aseptic surface 
by protective dressings is, therefore, of importance. 

The making of Rontgen-ray tubes, which has become an extensive 
industry, involves considerable exposure to the X-ray light. The 
effects are insidious, consisting of burns, nervousness, mental de- 
pression and, in males, loss of sexual power, which may last for 
months or become permanent in extreme cases. These symptoms may 
not become serious for several weeks after exposure has been sus- 
pended. 

The skin lesions begin as an acute dermatitis. There are red- 
ness and infiltration of the burned area, which is distinctly circum- 
scribed and often intensely itching. Blebs form, with serous and 
often purulent secretion. In severe cases, after protracted exposure 
to mild currents or brief exposure to intense currents, gangrene of 
the skin and subcutaneous tissues has been observed. In healing the 
cicatrices are extensive, and atrophy of the skin and telangiectases 
remain. 

Chronic skin lesions also develop in the hands and face. There 






LIGHT MODIFICATIONS 513 

are an hypertrophy and hardening hyperkeratosis of the skin of 
the entire hands. The skin becomes extremely rough and pigmented, 
and deep fissures form in which desquamated epithelium gathers as a 
white powder. '(Unna.) Multiple warts also appear, which are 
punctate and hypersensitive. They gather especially about the nails 
and lateral surfaces of the fingers. Subepithelial abscess may form. 
In a case of Miihsam's the paronychia of one finger was so in- 
tractable and painful as to require amputation of the joint. The 
finger nails become thin and very brittle. Telangiectases appear on 
the backs of the hands, forming stellate dark spots. The hair of the 
face may be permanently lost. The histological changes present an 
hypertrophy of the epidermis, with atrophy of the hair, nails, seba- 
ceous and sweat glands. In the deeper layers of the skin there is a 
chronic interstitial edema with atrophy of the elastic fibers. The 
vessels are little altered, but the musculature is thickened. 

The X-ray has special predilection for lymphatic tissues, as shown 
by its sometimes favorable temporary action in splenic and glandular 
types of leukemia, but its protracted action may cause leukemia. 
Von Jagic (Berliner klin. Woch., 1911, xlviii, 1220) has reported 
3 cases of lymphatic leukemia in X-ray workers and a fourth in a 
chemist who prepared radium. In ten X-ray workers he found de- 
cided lymphocytosis, amounting to 35 to 52 per cent. Animal ex- 
periments with both X-rays and radium confirmed these observations. 
The X-ray acts upon the bone marrow cells and stimulates the lym- 
phatic tissue activity. 

The cutaneous irritation caused by prolonged use of the X-ray, 
or by its less prolonged use when followed by other forms of irrita- 
tion, stimulates the epithelial cells so as sometimes to cause epi- 
thelioma or malignant granuloma which demands excision. 

All these chronic cutaneous symptoms and lesions are exceedingly 
inert and rebellious to .treatment. Moreover, they are made worse 
by many substances with which the hands may come in contact, 
especially the antiseptics used by surgeons, photographic chemicals, 
etc. One of my colleagues who was an enthusiastic pioneer in 
X-ray work was finally obliged to abandon his profession on account 
of the constant pain and annoyance experienced from his hands. 



514 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

The testicular atrophy resulting from prolonged X-ray exposure 
is accompanied by azob'spermia, and rabbits exposed experimentally 
to the rays show absence of the epithelium of the seminal canals. 

Protection. Protection consists in making all exposures to the 
X-ray as brief as possible and in the use of sheet-lead screens and 
armor. Lead-glass observation windows and goggles also should be 
used to protect the eyes. 

Treatment. Burns from electric light, X-ray or radium should 
be protected by anodyne liniments or soothing ointments, containing 
oil, vaselin or simple cerate with opium or other anodyne. Protec- 
tion from the air, as by wearing rubber gloves, and from too-frequent 
washing is important. Later dressings with alkaline carbonates with 
soaps and stearates are recommended. The hard warts may be 
touched with glacial acetic acid, salicylic acid soaps and ointments, 
and hydrogen peroxid. 

RADIUM 

Radium is somewhat similar in its effects upon the skin to the 
X-ray, but owing to its very restricted use and comparatively short 
duration of exposures, cases of serious damage by it are few. It 
causes acute dermatitis after brief exposure of the skin, with redness, 
hyperemia and intolerable itching. In weaker applications no symp- 
toms may appear for a fortnight, when the reddened areas gradually 
become thickened and necrotic. Desquamation follows. In the more 
severe burns from radium there is deep ulceration and sometimes 
pus formation from infection. 

Prevention. As in the case of the X-ray, protection consists in 
the use of sheet lead screens and careful limitation of the time of 
exposure. The acute dermatitis is relieved somewhat by compresses 
of cold aluminum acetate and the use of simple unguents like cold 
cream to protect the surface from the air. 

VARIOUS LIGHTS 

Effects Upon the Eyes. Light from burnished surfaces which is 
reflected to the eyes of metal polishers and buffers, when the eyes 
are constantly focused upon it, gives rise to retinal hyperesthesia, with 



LIGHT MODIFICATIONS 515 

pain and annoyance, which results in dimness of vision. The wear- 
ing of smoke-colored glasses cures the difficulty. 

Light from steel and iron furnaces is accompanied by tempera- 
tures ranging from 1,800 F. for cast iron to 2,800 F. for molten 
metal, and in the Bessemer steel process up to a maximum of 
3,200 F. 

A workman with practice can look into a furnace up to a tem- 
perature of 2,000 F. without glasses, but with higher temperatures 
requires dark blue glasses ; and with the highest temperatures obser- 
vations are made at a distance of 30 feet or more through a spectro- 
scope. As some of the smelti-ng processes require many hours of 
intermittent watching, the work at best is very trying and some 
workmen cannot continue it. If one looks directly into the fur- 
nace without colored glasses, one is unable to see for several minutes 
afterward, as in looking directly into the sun. 

Blast furnaces sometimes become clogged with iron which has 
solidified after incomplete emptying. This iron is cut away with 
an electric arc, and to shield the eyes the workmen- must wear triple- 
faced glasses, one blue between two red ones. 

Cataract occurs sometimes both in glass blowers, especially bottle 
makers, and steel foundrymen as a result of prolonged overstimula- 
tion of the eyes with great heat and light. Parsons and Gunn, in 
England, in 1908, found a variety of cataract in some bottle blowers 
which presented an opaque disc in the posterior cortex of the optic 
lens, frequently surrounded by several lesser opacities as if by 
satellites. 

Cataract has also been observed with some frequency in black- 
smiths, cooks, bakers, and puddlemen in foundries. In such cases 
great heat appears to be a more powerful agent than the light. 

Electric arc welding implies a temperature up to 7,000 F. or 
more. And in this process, as in short circuits of electric power 
currents, the eyes may be damaged by repeated flashes of brilliant 
light, unless protected by helmets, shields or screens made with a 
half-dozen alternate layers of blue and red glass. (Fig. 99.) When 
the eyes are thus injured they are blinded immediately and after 
>me hours the lids swell, the tears flow freely, and there is intense 



516 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

burning pain. Serious ophthalmia and retinitis may result which 
are very slow in recovery and may damage vision permanently. 

The intense electric arc light decomposes the visual purple faster 
than it is regenerated, and gives rise to retinal exhaustion, causing 
asthenopia. In the so-called "electrical ophthalmia" the patient com- 




FIG. 99. ELECTRIC ARC WELDING. A shield is provided for the arc welder 
which is fitted with colored glass and suspended in front of the workman so 
that he watches the work through the colored glass and is also protected 
from the heat. (Illinois Steel Company.) 



plains of persistent after-images and photophobia. Severe conjunc- 
tivitis may involve the submucous tissues of the eyelids. In some 
cases cataract has followed exposure to intense electric light flashes. 
Serious injury to the eyes of workers in electric light and power 
wiring may occur by a single sudden short-circuit flash, as it some- 
times does after lightning stroke. 

Surgeon-General Stokes has called attention to the harmful effect 
upon the eyesight of men in the navy who are called upon to work 
much with the searchlight. This form of intense arc light may 
cause coagulation in the retinal cells or changes in the optic nerve. 



LIGHT MODIFICATIONS 517 

The mercury vapor arc light does not appear to affect vision ma- 
terially, as it was at first claimed that it would. In a study of 28 
persons, some of whom used it for four years, Dr. W. H. Williams 
found it produced no more strain than any other bright lamplight. 
Temporary color fatigue results, but this is common to all bright- 
colored illuminants. In this cqlor fatigue there was much confusion 
between green and blue, but very little between green and red. The 
matter is mainly of scientific rather than practical interest. The oxy- 
acetylene light is very liable to strain the eyes seriously. 

Dr. G. L. Apfelbach reports an interesting series of cases of oph- 
thalmia in electricians produced by sudden blinding flashes of electric 
light caused by short-circuiting. (Bull. Illinois State Dep't of Fac- 
tory Inspection, April, 1914.) 

Protection. In all cases of danger to the eyes from excessive 
light or light and heat combined, protective measures by means of 
colored glasses and screens and shortening the duration of the ex- 
posure are of the utmost importance, for, beyond prolonged rest of 
the eyes and continued protection from daylight by deeply colored 
glasses, little can be accomplished by treatment. There are many 
forms of protective colored glasses. Euphos glass absorbs the ultra- 
violet electric rays, and color combinations of various sorts are used, 
as a layer of blue glass between two of red. Hallaner glass also 
absorbs actinic rays. 

The United States Steel Corporation has a hygienic rule which 
prevents workmen who use protective glasses from exchanging them 
with one another on account of the danger of transmitting eye 
infections. 

In only 11 States is there any legal control of factory lighting, ac- 
cording to E. L. Elliott (Amer. Labor Legislation Rev., June, 1911, 
vol. 1, No. 2), and in some of these the regulations are so vague as 
to be of little use, although the effect of good light upon the worker is 
both physical and moral to a very important degree. Continued eye 
strain not alone impairs efficiency, but often begets headache, nerv- 
ousness and digestive disturbances, and tends to increase many sorts 
of accidents from machinery, etc. It often happens where men are 
working with bright tools upon brightly polished metallic surfaces 






518 DISEASES DUE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT 

that a bright light is focused on the cutting point, and all through 
the rest of the room there is semi-darkness, which adds to the eye- 
strain. This bright light on the tools often greatly exceeds the inten- 
sity of daylight, yet by virtue of the surrounding gloom appears less 
brilliant to the operative. In such cases very much better results are 
obtained by a more diffuse light reflected from white ceilings and 
walls. (Calder.) 

As Elliott says, "It is impossible to produce an abundance of 
light and a resulting illumination that will produce such a severe 
strain upon the eyes as to result often in permanent injury to the 
eyes themselves and severely affect the general health. Any adequate 
law must therefore go farther than this and prohibit such uses of 
light as are harmful." 

He also points out that a much brighter illumination is required 
for dark-colored materials than for light ones, and that women are 
so often employed upon delicate work necessitating good vision that 
they especially need the best conditions of well-diffused light. 

In Holland a fairly definite law regulates the minimum artificial 
light intensity for the workroom at the standard of one foot candle, 
but one and a half foot candle is required in industries demanding 
keen vision and which are much sought by women, such as knitting, 
embroidery, jewelry making, etc., as well as engraving and printing. 

When electric light bulbs are swung over machines close to and on 
a level with the operator's eyes the effect becomes in time very 
trying. Writing of garment workers, C. T. Graham-Rogers states: 
"Another danger to which these operators are exposed is that of 
having to work with artificial illumination on a level with the eyes, 
especially that from incandescent electric bulbs. Reports show this 
has a deleterious effect, not only upon the eyes, but upon the general 
health." 

Wireless telegraphers work in small dark rooms in which there 
is constant overetherization of the air they breathe by reason of the 
alternating currents used to generate the waves. German physicians 
have lately called attention to a serious type of anemia which may 
affect such operators. The illumination of the workroom is further 
discussed upon page 86. 



ELECTRIC SHOCK 519 



IV. ELECTRIC SHOCK 

Electric shock, arising either from contact with live wires or more 
often merely from unexpected electric flashes or supposed contact 
with dangerous currents, produces in neurotic subjects hystero-neuras- 
thenia. It is not common among telegraph or telephone linemen, or 
those who work on third-rail construction or about dynamos, and 
hence is, properly speaking, not a true "occupational" neurosis. 
The symptoms, moreover, are apt to be directly proportioned in in- 
tensity to the extent of damages which it is hoped to secure. Such 
patients exhibit various hysterical contractures, as of the fingers and 
hands, lameness, muscular tremors, paralyses, dysesthesia and anes- 
thesia, and sometimes deafness and blindness with complaint of 
flashes of light. In a series of cases reported by Dr. John J. Moor- 
head, arising in New York (Jour. Amer. Med. Assoc., April 2, 1910) 
was one of pseudo-Dupuytren's flexion of the fingers. The patient 
had been holding a wire when a current of 110 volts was unex- 
pectedly turned on and produced slight burns of the hand. A month 
later he had recovered, but had many subjective sensations. It has 
been established by Dr. George W. Crile and others that high-tension 
currents cause no demonstrable chemical or other changes in the 
nerves or tissues, apart from possible contact burns. Hence in these 
cases of hysteroneurasthenia there are no objective phenomena to 
record. On diverting the patient's attention, or on watching him 
recover from primary ether anesthesia, it is easy to demonstrate the 
lack of genuineness of contractures and paralyses. 



PAKT V 
SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

I. THE BLOOD 

The occupational poisons which exert their toxic influence specifi- 
cally upon the blood, in so far as their influence is concerned, affect 
mainly the red blood corpuscles or their hemoglobin content, or both. 
The white cells (excepting by the action of benzol) are usually only 
influenced secondarily in consequence of serious anemias, being unaf- 
fected primarily or specifically, as in the case of bacterial toxemias 
and special types of blood diseases. Some of the occupational pois- 
ons act by lessening the duration of life, so to speak, of the red cells, 
others by directly dissolving them, and in some cases the first effect 
is produced by small doses of the poison, and the second effect follows 
with stronger doses (E. Grawitz). The first or plasmotropic effect 
results from accelerated destruction of the red cells in the liver and 
spleen, and is characterized by the morphological changes of poikilo- 
cytosis, polychromatophilia, and the granular degeneration which is 
so prominent a feature of chronic lead poisoning, known as granular 
basophilia. With poikilocytosis the red cells present shriveled, 
irregular and distorted forms. With polychromatophilia they pre- 
sent differences in reaction with staining agents, and with basophilia 
they become filled with minute granules uniformly distributed. 

The second or solvent effect upon the red cells, or plasmolytic 
effect, is manifest through immediate solution of the erythrocytes in 
the plasma, thereby liberating hemoglobin, which condition is de- 
scribed as hemoglobinemia. Some of the corpuscles may merely 
lose their hemoglobin without themselves dissolving, but appearing 

520 



THE BLOOD 521 

as transparent, colorless discs. Some of the dissolved hemoglobin 
is converted into bilirubin in the liver and part is stored as hemo- 
siderin in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The bile pigment being 
thus increased, some of it is reabsorbed in the lymph passages and 
jaundice ensues. This form of icterus, originally known as the 
"hematogenous" type, has recently been termed by Naunyn and 
others "resorption icterus." In extreme cases some of the hemo- 
globin, or more often methemoglobin, passes off in the urine, causing 
methemoglobinuria, and, if the tubules of the kidneys become oc- 
cluded by an excess of pigment, anuria may result (Grawitz). 

Arsenuretted hydrogen is a strong solvent of the red blood cells 
without formation of methemoglobin. 

Liebermann found that "lead, mercury and phosphorus increase 
ithe resistance of the red corpuscles, while benzene and benzol reduce 
it. The Liebermann test is based on laking of the red cells in 
distilled water and the absence of laking in physiologic salt solution. 
The unit is two minutes for the laking of one drop of undefibrinated 
blood, that is, 0.05 c. c. The blood is generally used for the test 
with a salt solution between 0.4 and 0.7. After two minutes salt 
solution is added of a concentration which brings the new solution 
to 1 per cent. For example, to 5 c. c. of a 0.5 per cent, solution is 
added 5 c. c. of a 1.5 per cent, solution, thus bringing the concentra- 
tion to 1 per cent. The resistance quotient is the number of red 
cells which fail to lake under these conditions in proportion to those 
which are dissolved." (Abstract from the Medical Record, Nov., 
1912.) 

Another group of poisons consisting notably of nitrous oxid and 
carbon monoxid affect the blood, not through dissolution of the cor- 
puscles, but by forming permanent union with the hemoglobin, 
thereby preventing the exercise of its normal function of oxygen 
carrier to the tissues. Carbon monoxid hemoglobin is very similar 
to oxyhemoglobin, but differs from it in that it remains quite un- 
affected by reducing agents. 

Sulphuretted hydrogen, as developed in sewers, trenches, decom- 
posing cadavers and in chemical laboratories, forms another com- 
pound known as "sulphomethemoglobin," which presents a definite 



522 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

absorption band in the red of the spectrum. In decomposed cadavers 
it imparts a greenish color to the blood and tissues. 

Prussic acid poisoning imparts a red color to the venous blood, 
because, according to Grawitz, the tissues cease to appropriate oxy- 
gen, hence it accumulates in the blood, with excess of oxyhemoglobin. 

Poisons which cause morphological changes in the erythrocytes 
without dissolving them are typified by lead. In 1899 E. Grawitz 
and Hamel demonstrated the granulations which occur in the red 
corpuscles in nearly all cases of chronic plumbism. Erben, further- 
more, has demonstrated that such blood possesses also a high iron 
content with an increase in fat in the serum. In general, the num- 
ber of the granular basophiles bears direct relation to the severity 
of the lead poisoning, but the phenomenon is also observed as an 
early symptom sometimes in those who have not developed any other 
symptoms. Grawitz has shown that, in patients previously saturated 
with lead which has been stored in the body, such lead may be liber- 
ated from the organs where it has long remained after change 
of occupation of the workman, and suddenly give rise to baso- 
philia. 

Poisons which destroy the blood through formation of methemo- 
globin and associated dissolution of the erythrocytes act both through 
oxidization, like iodin, chlorin, nitrites and ozone, and reduction, 
like phosphorus, pyrogallol and hydrochinon. Other compounds there 
are which act in neither of these ways, like anilin and the carbolic 
acid series. Lime chlorid, for example, may cause, in addition to 
methemoglobinemia, methemoglobinuria or anuria and uremia. 
Nitrobenzol and nitroglycerin fumes, when inhaled, may cause seri- 
ous methemoglobinuria. Chromic acid is one of the most powerful 
of the poisons of this order, and anilin and its derivatives have simi- 
lar action. Acetanilid and other coal-tar depressants, when taken in 
overdose or for long periods of time, cause chronic cyanosis with 
marked blueness of the lips and finger-tips. 

Serious grades of simple anemia result in many trades, often as 
a combination of poor ventilation, poor food and toxic fumes in the 
atmosphere. Such anemia is commonly present in the metal poison 
cases, and may reach a degree bordering upon pernicious anemia. 



THE NERVES 523 

Typical chlorotic anemia is common among young girls who are 
employed as garment workers or in the various textile industries. 

Treatment. Treatment of the grave forms of anemia above 
described consists in affording abundant fresh air, animal food, rest, 
and attention to digestion, especially the avoidance of constipation. 
With the methemoglobin cases the object of treatment is to rid the 
system of any poison which may be in circulation, and to rid it of 
the useless methemoglobin corpuscles while fluid is supplied to dilute 
the blood and maintain blood pressure. To this end venesection to 
the extent of 14 to 16 ounces should be performed, and the blood 
withdrawn should be replaced by an equal volume of normal saline 
solution. In extreme cases direct blood transfusion may be em- 
ployed. Salines may also be given per rectum and by hypoder- 
moclysis in those who, being in coma, cannot swallow. Warmth 
should be applied to the body, and with anuria saline diuretics may 
be given and hot saline rectal injections, while the renal region may 
be cupped and poulticed. During convalescence arsenic appears of 
some value (in cases not due to arsenical poisoning), and the syrup 
of the iodid of iron may be used, although iron in general is of 
doubtful utility in the types of acute grave anemia under discussion. 
It certainly should not be relied upon, as it often is, as the only 
measure. 



H. THE NERVES 

OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN 

GENERAL 

It is difficult to limit the influence of occupation upon the dis- 
eases of nervous and mental character. In some few instances the 
relationship is definite and easily established, as in the locomotive 
engineer's sciatica or the lead worker's palsy. These may be called 
primary occupational diseases. In a second large group of cases, 
mainly functional, like neurasthenia, hysteria, etc., the symptoms may 
be due to unhygienic and depressing conditions of work rather than 
to anything intrinsically harmful in the work itself, such conditions, 



524 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

for example, as are so frequently met with among garment workers 
and textile fabric makers. These may be called secondary occupa- 
tional diseases. A third group of cases, still less definite, are those 
due to unusual conditions of exposure or mode of work, as exempli- 
fied in various occupational psychoses and insanities, where the com- 
bined influences of alcoholism, syphilis, irregular hours of work, 
strain of "speeding up," etc., make it extremely difficult to adjust 
the balance of one factor over another. These may be called occu- 
pational nervous diseases of mixed origin. 

The primary occupational nervous diseases usually affect the 
upper limbs (in about 90 per cent, of cases, according to Charles L. 
Dana), although the legs, face or trunk nerves are sometimes in- 
volved. They include paralysis, atrophy, neuritis, neuralgia, spasms, 
and a variety of sensory disturbances. Helene R. Baraks, in a Paris 
thesis of 1901, mentions 119 varieties of occupation especially liable 
to cause localized neuritis and other troubles from overwork. 

The secondary occupational nervous and mental phenomena are 
often less amenable to treatment than are those of the preceding 
group, for they are not only general rather than local, involving 
many organs, but are often referable in part to conditions of home 
environment difficult or impossible to control, even where well ap- 
preciated. The same statements apply in even greater degree to the 
third group of mixed cases. As Dana says, it may not be the occu- 
pation itself in such cases which does the chief harm it is merely 
a contributing factor. "It is what is done between times, what 
kind of rest is taken and what kind of home life is lived. It is this 
which does the harm." Occupation in general under wholesome 
conditions is far more healthful than idleness, and he believes that 
one reason why women are more "nervous" than men is that they 
have fewer occupations. Hence "it is not occupations themselves, 
but the industrial and domestic conditions to which working peo- 
ple are subjected, which cause the mass of nervous and mental 
diseases. 

"Scientific management, therefore, which speeds up the human 
machine, must give it longer rest and an absolute change of nervous 
and mental interest." (Dana.) 



THE NEliVES 525 



GENERAL FATIGUE 

Fatigue of muscles, nerves and the mind constitutes an im- 
portant factor in predisposition to disease among many classes of 
workmen and operatives. Its effects have become very noticeable 
of recent years, owing to the practice of "speeding up" or increasing 
the output of work under contracts where time-saving is an essen- 
tial matter. (See Speeding up, page 64.) General fatigue is most 
often met with among mill and factory operatives in the textile 
fabric industries. In these industries much complicated machinery 
is employed, and the faster it is operated and the longer the hours 
of work, the greater the physical and mental strain and consequent 
fatigue reaction. These problems have been most comprehensively 
studied by Josephine Goldmark in her admirable book on "Fatigue 
and Efficiency," comprising the results of studies made under the 
auspices of the Russell Sage Foundation. 

Potent factors in inducing fatigue found in large factories are 
incessant floor vibrations, as where many looms are working, con- 
stant noise, the confusion resulting from overcrowding, poor air, 
poor light and monotony of work. Fatigue is known to diminish 
the quantity of antibodies in the system, and hence to increase its 
susceptibility and lower its resistance to infectious diseases such as 
grippe, pneumonia and tuberculosis. General fatigue further acts 
by inhibiting digestion and ultimately interfering with nutrition. 
Another important result of general fatigue is in the decided in- 
crease in frequency of accidents from machinery which it occasions 
by lessening the alertness of the operative. 

In many industries, such as those of clothing manufacture, fruit 
and vegetable canning, etc., the season of the year makes the work 
periods very uneven, so that the employees may alternate idleness 
with physical strain and mental worry. For women and children 
this is particularly bad. Women possess, as a rule, less reserve 
strength than men for endurance in such tasks, and, owing to the 
menstrual function frequently becoming disordered under fatigue, 
they are liable to suffer serious and sometimes permanent impairment 



526 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

of health. They also are more liable to suffer from constipation, 
digestive disorders, and anemia, especially of chlorotic type. 

In some industries, such as work with blast furnaces, men are 
sometimes required to work in 24-hour shifts, although of late years 
this has been found to be an economic disadvantage, and is therefore 
less common than formerly. Engineers of fast trains are liable to 
the strain of long hours of concentrated work and attention, and the 
fatigue thus induced so lowers their power of alertness that serious 
accidents have in the past resulted from it. 

Continued fatigue results in muscular tremor and weakness, som- 
nolence, or sometimes insomnia, and has a marked tendency to les- 
sen the activity of the digestive functions. If greatly prolonged, it 
results in neurasthenia, hysteria and a variety of functional nervous 
disorders. Fatigue of individual muscle groups is described under 
the heading of Neuroses, on page 546. Neuralgias also are induced 
by it. Very similar to the effects of physical fatigue are those of 
worry which are more or less associated with occupation. Among 
these must be reckoned the fear of losing work, inability to com- 
plete allotted tasks on time, and a host of domestic anxieties, most 
of which resolve themselves into the matter of low wages and the 
consequent inability to secure adequate food and housing. 

NEURASTHENIA 

Neurasthenia is very common among many classes of workers. 
It is a dystrophy involving nerve centers in the brain and spinal 
cord and not originating in peripheral nerves, although the vaso- 
motor and sensory impulses become ultimately involved. As the 
disease is not fatal, opportunities for minute pathological study are 
unobtainable unless the patient dies from some acute disease or 
injury, but there is believed to be hyperemia of the gray matter of 
the brain, medulla and cord, and basilar headache is very common. 
There is a weakness of vasoconstrictor inhibitory centers, with con- 
sequent irregular dilatation and contraction of the vessels all through 
the body (Dana), and the vascular and glandular organs fail to 
obtain properly regulated blood supply in response to physiological 



THE NERVES 527 

demand, hence all manner of functional digestive disorders arise and 
general metabolism is impaired. 

To recount all the varied phenomena of this disorder would com- 
prise very many of the symptoms known to medicine, for the victim 
of it is rarely lacking in imagination, no matter how dull his other 
faculties may be. The distinctive characteristics, however, may be 
summarized as a general mental and bodily exhaustion, often without 
external appearance of any illness. The physical state is character- 
ized by disproportionate fatigue reaction to the slightest muscular 
effort, and the mental state by depression, vacillation, complete loss 
of decision, vague but constant apprehension of impending ill, and 
the discovery of neuralgic pains in every part of the body in turn. 
In some patients it may become a state of the utmost wretchedness, 
which is the more unendurable because there often seems to be no 
real physical cause which might be removable. Others regard their 
ailments with equanimity. While there may be actual physical ail- 
ment, the condition is predominantly a psychic disorder, for often 
much more serious local disease exists without the mental depression 
or apprehension of the neurasthenic. The disease is commonest in 
middle life, the very young and aged being equally free from it. I 
do not recall an octogenarian neurasthenic. By that time, if ever, 
one has found an equilibrium of life which is little disturbed by occu- 
pation or environment. 

The cause of the disease might tersely be described as worry and 
hurry; hence at times of "speeding up" in different employments 
the foundation of the trouble is chiefly laid. Overwork, work in 
depressing surroundings, as in dark, ill-ventilated, crowded rooms, 
monotony of piece work, are all conditions which strongly predis- 
pose to neurasthenia. To these must be added depressing home con- 
ditions of poor housing, poor feeding, family illness, drunkenness, the 
dread of losing work and facing starvation, and all the manifold 
trials and hardships engendered by poverty. 

Another important cause of neurasthenia is the experience of 
sudden shock such as is liable to occur in many industries where 
accidents from machinery, or possibly explosions or fires, may en- 
danger the lives of employees. Such shocks may injure the victim 






528 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

of subsequent neurasthenia directly or be witnessed as they endanger 
others. Overwork alone does not give rise to neurasthenia, but 
when accompanied by any of the foregoing deleterious conditions 
or wrong habits of life, as in dietetic, alcoholic or sexual abuses, it 
becomes a determining factor of importance. 

Neurasthenia may result from numerous types of reflex irrita- 
tion such as gastro-intestinal or menstrual disorders. Statistics as 
to the relation of sex to the occurrence of neurasthenia vary, and, 
as far as occupational cases are concerned, the grouping of the sexes 
necessitated by special lines of work has more to do with the matter 
than the question of sex per se. In general it may be said that it is 
more common among girls and women than among men, chiefly be- 
cause they possess less physiological reserve of nervous energy to 
meet the strain of unaccustomed tasks or that of the enforced haste 
to finish allotted tasks in quick time, or to perform extra hours of 
work made necessary by seasonal or other conditions of the market. 
The long hours of saleswomen at the height of the shopping season, 
and the long hours and haste often demanded in the textile and 
garment industries, are illustrations of these conditions. Race is 
another strongly predisposing cause of neurasthenia among some 
peoples, although it operates in great part from the fact that certain 
races elect occupations which themselves provide many conditions 
which are unfavorable. Among the great variety of races and nation- 
alities which at all times find representation among the immigrants 
who find their way to Bellevue Hospital and the clinics for the sick 
poor in New York City, it is my experience that the Polish and 
other types of foreign Hebrews are more prone to neurasthenia than 
are any others. Because many thousands of them follow the gar- 
ment industries, they afford a fertile field for its study. Prof. Sid- 
ney I. Schwab, in an essay upon "Neurasthenia Among Garment- 
workers" (Amer. Labor Legislation Review, vol. 1, No. 1, Jan., 
1911), reports a study during the decade 1900-1910 of 7,000 gar- 
ment-workers in the Jewish Dispensary in St. Louis, fully one- 
fourth of whom had pronounced neurasthenia. 

Symptoms. The symptoms of neurasthenia may be divided into 
two classes, the physical and mental. To tHe former belong head- 



THE NERVES 529 

ache, dyspepsia, muscular lassitude and feeble circulation. The ap- 
petite fails, the tongue is coated and constipation is the rule. Ex- 
cessive indicanuria is common. Insomnia, restlessness and undue 
irritability in response to external conditions are characteristics. 
The victim awakes unrefreshed from sleep, and dreads to resume 
the day's task. Pains in the neck and at the back of the head are 
usually complained of, and many patients become hypochondriacal 
and complain of neuralgic pains and sensory disturbances of all 
sorts, particularly hyperesthesia. These latter symptoms may be 
located in any part of the body, often disappear when attention is 
diverted, or may be produced by suggestion. Soreness of the scalp 
and intercostal neuralgia are common localizations of these ailments. 
If the occupation requires close use of the eyes, as in sewing, for 
example, blurring of vision, photophobia, pains in the eyeballs and 
muscular insufficiency may be complained of. Hypersensitiveness 
to sounds is common, especially among those who are employed near 
noisy machinery such as looms. Tremor of the hands affecting the 
handwriting and other delicate movements of coordination is com- 
mon, as well as tremor of the eyelids, when closed tightly, frequent 
winking and failure to look one directly in the eye. The hands and 
feet are often referred to as feeling cold and may present a mottled 
cyanosis and clammy perspiration. Palpitation of the heart, with 
frequent variations in arterial tension, is common, and the latter is 
usually low (often 110 to 120 mm.). The sexual functions are 
weakened and intercourse is followed by exhaustion. The pulse vol- 
ume is often small. Sighing respiration may be observed, with gen- 
eral feebleness of respiratory movement. The urine is of low specific 
gravity and often loaded with phosphates and oxalates. Dysmen- 
orrhea is common. The skin may appear pale or yellowish and there 
is marked functional inactivity of the liver. Deficient biliary secre- 
tion gives rise to flatus and often foul-smelling stools. General 
metabolism is affected so that most neurasthenics tend to become 
thin, some of them markedly so. There are those, however, who 
eat and sleep well and maintain good nutrition, their symptoms 
being largely psychic. There are others who add to their weight. 
Owing to muscular weakness and mental inertia, they exercise little, 



530 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

breathe poorly and hence suboxidation favors the storage of fat. 
Such cases are very common among elderly women who already 
tend toward obesity, but are less often seen as an outcome of indus- 
trial occupations than are the other types. 

In the lean type of cases visceroptosis is exceedingly common, 
chiefly among women, especially after childbirth, but I have also 
seen many cases among men. The stomach may descend halfway 
below the umbilicus and become vertical. The intestines are low and 
a floating right and often left kidney may be palpated. Pyloric 
spasm or twist is common from the gastroptosis, and gastric dilata- 
tion with succussion and catarrh of the stomach result. Such cases 
are extremely common in my clinic, especially among laundresses, 
shirtwaist and other female garment-workers. Thus a vicious circle 
is established between the neurasthenic state, with weakness and 
indigestion, and the gastroptosis which follows loss of weight and of 
tone in the abdominal muscles and gives rise to serious digestive dis- 
order and further weakness. Not all neurasthenics have visceropto- 
sis, but very many do, and, if the gastroptosis develops first, it is 
very liable to lead to neurasthenia as long as the patient is com- 
pelled to work hard and be much on her feet, stooping, lifting or 
standing for hours at a time. 

The mental symptoms comprise an intense egoism toward the 
patient's own physical and mental state, depression, hopelessness of 
betterment, constant introspection and comparison of symptoms, and 
marked exaggeration and reiteration in the description of them. The 
patient may seek all manner of advice as to a given line of conduct 
and then be wholly unable to arrive at a definite conclusion or carry 
out a definite plan of action. He worries incessantly over trivial 
occurrences and apprehension of ills which have no foundation in 
fact. He may become hypersensitive to criticism, morose and sus- 
picious. He becomes selfish and morbidly self-analytical and intro- 
spective. 

Prognosis. Occupational neurasthenia is the commonest of the 
affections of the nervous system referable to special industries. It 
is liable to become chronic and very intractable unless the working 
conditions of the individual are capable of rectification. In minor 



THE NERVES 531 

grades, while the patient still continues at work, it so greatly impairs 
efficiency as to become a grave economic problem in many industries. 
Occupational neurasthenia may not be curable while the patient 
remains at work, and it may be necessary to secure a long period of 
rest. In mild cases, however, a change of occupation rather than 
entire cessation of work may not only be possible but desirable, in 
that it occupies the mind and prevents the introspection which is so 
common a feature of the condition. 

Prevention. Careful consideration of the causes of occupational 
neurasthenia above described will suggest methods of prevention. 
Bearing in mind that it is not work alone, but conditions of environ- 
ment in the workshop and home, and of hurry and strain, which 
conduce to the establishment of the neurasthenic state, many such 
influences may be avoided by attention to hygiene, proper intervals 
of rest, diversion and relaxation of nerve tension. Temporary ex- 
change of monotonous or strenuous tasks for others less taxing may 
prove preventive of nervous breakdown without adding the worry 
of being out of employment. Periodic medical examination of work- 
ing girls particularly and of working women may prove an economic 
gain to both employee and employer. 

Treatment. In serious cases the best results are obtained by 
rest, with massage, spinal douching, dieting and intestinal treatment. 
The nutrition should be improved by an ample diet containing 
especially fats and cereals such as eggs, cream, oil, crisp bacon, and 
butter, with hominy, rice, cornmeal "mush," and light breadstuffs. 
Milk may be given if pains be taken to counteract constipation. In 
general a low proteid diet is preferable and for a time meat should 
be excluded. The regular meals should be supplemented by light 
luncheons of such foods as gruel, cream diluted with Vichy, beaten 
eggs, custards and junket. The aim of dieting should be to lessen 
intestinal fermentation and putrefaction, and promote assimilation 
of foods which will increase the body weight and strength without 
overtaxing the digestive organs with too much variety. As improve- 
ment takes place, fresh green vegetables, white potatoes and fresh 
fruits, such as apples and oranges, should be given, and fresh fish 
may be eaten. 



532 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISOKDEES 

Intestinal treatment consists in the use of saline laxatives such 
as sodium phosphate or the saline mineral waters, the giving of anti- 
fermentative remedies such as salol or creosote, and daily high 
irrigation of the colon with a hot normal saline solution. The latter 
procedure often proves of very great benefit if thoroughly performed, 
using four or five quarts of water with free return through a double 
rectal tube while the buttocks are well elevated. 

Hypoacidity or anacidity is often present, and dilute hydrochloric 
acid (TTI xx) with tincture of nux vomica (TTI x) should be given 
after each principal meal. In the large group of cases in which 
gastroptosis is present a dry diet should be prescribed and no fluid 
should be drunk with meals, for the reason that a glass of water or 
cup of coffee or bowl of soup merely adds weight to the prolapsed 
stomach and dilutes the already weakened gastric juice, thereby 
greatly retarding digestion. A low abdominal binder giving uni- 
form support to the lower abdominal wall is most helpful in these 
cases. It should be worn beneath the corset, which, if tight, merely 
makes cylindrical compression and crowds the viscera downward. 
Tight-lacing, in fact, in young women seriously promotes gastropto- 
sis. Neurasthenic patients are very apt to beg for sedatives and 
"tonics." As a rule, the less medicine they take the better, and on 
no account should strong hypnotics be used. The multiple neuralgic 
pains complained of may better be relieved by local treatment with 
anodyne liniments or ointments as described on page 542. Insom- 
nia may often be relieved by a lukewarm general bath (95-98 F.) 
or spinal Scotch douche of alternating hot and cold water, followed 
by vigorous rubbing, given at night, and the taking of a cup of hot 
milk or gruel on retiring. As the patient improves, deep-breathing 
exercises should be performed twice a day, and during the day 
reclining in the open air as much as possible is to be encouraged. 
In a tenement, where a balcony may be wanting, a fire-escape or the 
roof often may be utilized for fresh-air treatment. Lying down to 
rest for an hour or two after meals greatly favors digestion, particu- 
larly in the visceroptosis cases. 

The psychic treatment is often as important- as the physical. 
The neurasthenic lacks decision and each detail of treatment of every 



THE NERVES 533 

kind should be definitely prescribed, giving, for example, the exact 
number of minutes for exercise, douching, etc., the hours of meals, 
quantity and quality of the food, etc. Much tact and patience are 
required to deal with the manifold minor ailments which are com- 
plained of, which often are magnified by well-meaning but too sym- 
pathetic friends. The patient should be taught not to expect a 
different remedy for each complaint,, but that all are part of a gen- 
eral fatigue condition which will soon yield to the hygienic meas- 
ures prescribed. So soon as the patient is strong enough, simple 
means of occupying the hands and diverting the mind should be 
initiated. For this purpose something new that yields definite, tan- 
gible results is most desirable. For example, in the Out-Patient 
Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital many neurasthenic 
working women are taught clay modeling of such simple things as 
cups and saucers or vases. While at work they are forbidden to 
discuss or think of their ailments. Remedial occupation of this type 
is one of the most important and successful adjuncts to treatment. 
The laboring poor cannot command the benefits of travel and costly 
diversions open to the rich, but, when possible to secure it, a few 
weeks of country life may do much to accelerate convalescence and 
prevent the relapses which are so common when the question of future 
work or starvation is the alternative which constantly hangs over the 
patient. 

HYSTERIA 

Closely allied to neurasthenia, but occurring more frequently in 
younger subjects, especially females, is hysteria. Similar causes 
may produce it, but especially modern occupations, which, like tele- 
phone operating, for example, tend to overexcite and stimulate both 
mind and body, so that the higher brain centers lose their inhibitory 
control or restraining influence over the general nerve functions of 
the body, and leave it a prey to exaggerated response to external 
stimulation of great variety. Acute hysteria may result from sud- 
den fright or shock, sustained in escaping from a burning factory or 
an explosion, or from accidents from machinery which have befallen 
the patient herself or others. Although many of these cases may 



534 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

scarcely be classed as strictly occupational, chronic hysteria is often 
occupational. It may result from overwork and the strain of "speed- 
ing up" to finish allotted tasks in short time, or in not a few in- 
stances it is the direct outcome of some form of chemical poisoning. 
A notable example of the latter is met with in bisulphid of carbon, 
which may produce hysteria in both men and women, sometimes of 
middle or advanced age. This type is described under Carbon Bisul- 
phid on page 317. Lead encephalopathy, described on page 240, 
affords another example of a toxic hysteria, and so does poisoning 
by mercury (page 293). 

Hysteria, then, is a psychosis due to either mental or toxic dis- 
turbance of the brain cortex. It is characterized by emotional or 
convulsive crises of greater or less severity, with intervening periods 
in which certain mild stigmata are observable. The disease may ap- 
pear in a major or minor form, according to its severity, and is at 
present without known pathological basis. 

It is, in its occupational type as in others, much more common 
in girls and women up to middle age than in men, although the 
latter are by no means free from it. The common factors of hered- 
ity, race and harassing home surroundings are accentuated by occu- 
pations involving great fatigue, long hours of work and unhygienic 
surroundings. Alcoholism is a predisposing factor when it exists. 
Among ths working classes of different nationalities met with in this 
country the foreign Hebrews present a very large proportion of cases, 
as they do those of neurasthenia. 

Symptoms. Hysteria minor is characterized by mental depres- 
sion, uncontrollable attacks of weeping or laughing without due 
cause, restlessness, general nervousness, apprehension, undue reflex 
response to external stimuli, vertical headache, spinal pains, the 
sensation of choking or globus in the throat, vasomotor irritation with 
flushing and sensation of chilliness, tremor of the hands and awk- 
ward, ill-controlled movements. There may be vomiting and a va- 
riety of hyperesthetic symptoms. It differs mainly from neuras- 
thenia (with which it may be associated) in the peculiar, un- 
reasonable mental state, strong emotional crises, and the stigmata 
described below. Volubility may alternate with taciturnity and 



THE NERVES 535 

peevishness. The appetite is capricious and food may be re- 
fused. 

Hysteria major is less common among the class of occupational 
cases than hysteria minor and hysterical stigmata. There are crises 
of convulsions, violent shouting, loud weeping, violent jactation, 
fainting, and semi-coma. This form of attack particularly is induced 
by shock or fright, and in such cases the crisis may be almost imme- 
diate, when occurring in a previously neurotic subject. There may 
be gastric crises with pain and violent retching. The sphincters 
usually remain under control. Rapid respiration (40 to 60) may 
be observed without complaint of dyspnea or cyanosis. The pulse 
is quick (110-120) and soft or feeble. Violent outbursts of temper 
with beating of adjacent objects or persons may be present, and 
there may be ceaseless reiteration of some fancied desire. The con- 
vulsions are accompanied by cries and constant jactation, but the 
tongue is rarely bitten, as it is in epilepsy. If the patient falls or 
throws herself down, she usually contrives to do so without serious 
injury. Certain movements such as kicking or threshing the arms 
may be continuously repeated. The pupils are dilated and there 
may be temporary strabismus. Marked opisthotonos may occur, or 
the patient may lie quiet with general tremor of the body and limbs. 
There is passage of much urine of low specific gravity and light 
color, following the crises. 

The crises may be aborted often by an emetic, a dash of cold 
water, or, what is particularly useful, playing a syphon of carbonic 
water over the face. In some cases rigidity of the limbs follows the 
crisis. The crises may last a few minutes or an hour or two, and 
may be repeated several times a day, with equal suddenness. 

The stigmata (or interparoxysmal state) comprise paralyses, con- 
tractures and sensory disturbances. There may be ataxic and chronic 
voluntary types of movement in the extremities, and one or more 
of the latter may be paralyzed, paraplegia being common. The laryn- 
geal muscles may be paralyzed and aphonia is often observed. It is 
frequently combined with anesthesia of the mucous membrane of the 
pharynx. The ocular muscles and eyelids may show various types 
of paralysis. All these symptoms may develop suddenly, last for 



536 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

a few hours or days,. and disappear with equal suddenness. Amy- 
asthenia, or sudden muscular weakness, is common whereby the pa- 
tient may suddenly drop an object carried in the hand or have the 
legs give out. The deep reflexes are not exaggerated, but skin reflexes 
may be. 

Contractures are met with oftenest in one or two toes or fingers 
to which attention is directed, but sometimes involve an entire 
limb. They are unaccompanied by atrophy and are easily overcome. 
Tremor may involve any of the voluntary muscles, including the 
tongue and those of the head. It is especially marked in the fingers 
and ceases during rest or sleep. The oscillations are from 5 to 7 
times a second (Dana). Tremor of the eyelids is very common 
with frequent winking. 

Hyperesthetic and anesthetic areas are present in varied distri- 
bution as segmental or hemianesthesia, etc. Tactile and thermic 
sensations are much less often involved than the pain sense. The 
retina is also often anesthetic. The visual field may be limited and 
color sense disturbed. The senses of taste and hearing may be les- 
sened in activity or temporarily abolished. Typical points or zones 
of hyperesthesia are usually present. They are most often found 
over the ovaries, beneath the left nipple, at the inner margin of the 
scapulae, over the epigastrium and manubrium. Migraine and neu- 
ralgias are common. There may be attacks of vomiting without nau- 
sea, of food regurgitation and rumination. All food may be re- 
fused, or indigestible substances may be eaten or harmful substances 
swallowed, such as buttons, pins, etc. Vasomotor symptoms persist, 
such as flushing, areas of mottled cyanosis and cold, edema of the 
hands or feet, and local perspiration. "Hysterical fever" is a very 
problematical entity. I have seen a number of cases which on 
careful examination proved to be due to deliberate deception. The 
interparoxysmal mental state is characterized by selfishness, com- 
plaints, craving for sympathy and attention, rapidly changing moods, 
intensified perceptions and lack of will or definite purpose. The 
mind is left to drift and yield to any passing whim or impression. 
Deceit is common, in order to attain notoriety or sympathy. 

Diagnosis. Diagnosis of hysteria is rarely difficult in the occu- 



THE NERVES 537 

pational cases. The symptoms are often simulated from a desire to 
exaggerate accidental injuries from machinery and secure financial 
damages, but a careful study of the stigmata above described will 
always lead sooner or later to detection of fraud. In the grouping 
of the manifold symptoms there is always something omitted or not 
under voluntary control by those who are malingering hysterical 
phenomena. I have frequently detected such frauds by placing the 
patient under the initial stage of slight general anesthesia. On re- 
covery there is an interval, before the patient fully has her bearings, 
when previous symptoms disappear. For example, aphonia may 
give place to shouting, the paralyzed legs kick out vigorously, anes- 
thesia may change to hyperesthesia, etc. Diverting the patient's 
attention momentarily and introducing the element of mild shock 
or surprise also often reveals the temporary hysterical nature of 
symptoms. 

Prevention. Those of neurotic temperament or inheritance 
should not enter industries which demand fixed attention and celerity 
of action such as are required of telephone operators and those em- 
ployed with many kinds of machinery. It is in just such cases that 
a "clearing-house" for medical examination to determine efficiency 
would prove beneficial to employee and employer alike. Further 
suggestions for prophylaxis are given in the section on Neurasthenia, 
page 531. 

Treatment. Practically all that has been said of the treatment 
of neurasthenia on page 531 is applicable to hysteria. In addition 
the need of strong mental and moral support, and of isolation from 
home environment or too-sympathetic friends, is of the utmost im- 
portance. Hydrotherapy, particularly spinal douching and wet 
packs, is of great value. Static electricity profoundly impresses pa- 
tients and may be quite useful in the cure of paralyses and contrac- 
tures. For hysterical convulsions Dana recommends apomorphin, 
gr. 1/12, given hypodermatically. There is nothing like genuine 
severe nausea to distract the patient's attention from hysterical exag- 
gerations. In general, as few drugs as possible should be used in 
the treatment of hysteria, and, when employed, the most should be 
made of their anticipated effect. Zinc valerianate, ammoniated tine- 



538 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

ture of valerian and asafetida have achieved the first reputation as 
sedatives for these cases. 

NEURALGIA 

Neuralgias are common as a result of occupational poisons and 
local or general fatigue. Foul air, irregularity of meals and of 
action of the bowels, with intestinal autotoxemia and anemia, are com- 
mon causes. The inhalation of toxic gases, vapors and fumes may 
produce neuralgia of the nerves of the head and face or of the 
extremities. Chronic illuminating gas poisoning (page 323), sul- 
phuretted hydrogen poisoning (page 362), benzene poisoning (page 
311), and a number of similar toxic agents give rise to anemia, of 
which neuralgia is a very common accompaniment. Gastralgia re- 
sults from swallowing many varieties of the common metal poisons, 
and enteralgia is common in lead poisoning. Among girl mill hands 
working in textile industries, or those employed in the several 
branches of the clothing industry who either stand for long hours 
tending machines, such as looms, or who sit in cramped positions in 
dusty, ill-ventilated rooms, neuralgia of facial and ovarian type is 
very common. 

Symptoms. The chief characteristic of neuralgia is a sharp, 
lancinating, stabbing or boring pain, which attacks the patient in 
frequent paroxysms with intervals in which there is merely a dull 
ache or feeling of soreness. The pain usually follows the definite 
course of a nerve distribution, but may irradiate from it. It is ac- 
centuated by thermic changes and superficial pressure, although deep 
pressure sometimes affords momentary relief. There may be accom- 
panying sensations of numbness, formication, weight or cold. Some- 
times there are transient vasomotor disturbances such as local con- 
gestion, slight elevation of superficial temperature, edema or sweat- 
ing, but such changes are usually due to the organic lesions of neu- 
ritis rather than the functional disturbance of neuralgia. In chronic 
cases tenderness on pressure is observed over the exit of nerve trunks 
from bone foramina, or from between muscles and fascia. Paralysis 
and atrophy do not ensue. The pains of neuralgia are transitory and 
may be migratory, appearing successively in different parts of the 



I THE NERVES 539 

body. They may be distinctly periodic, especially when due to an 
occupation which establishes a fatigue rhythm. Often they are 
worse at night. Where constipation continues or anemia progresses 
they become more frequent and severe. 

Diagnosis. Neuralgia is to be distinguished from neuritis by 
the migratory, fleeting character of the pain and the appearance of 
points of superficial hyperesthesia without paralysis, atrophy or an- 
esthesia. 

Treatment. Attention should be given to securing g<5W ventila- 
tion and food, and, in so far as possible, rest. The use of a hot 
poultice often gives great relief; a menthol liniment or ointment 
(page 542) should be applied to the course of the nerve. A dose of 
calomel should be taken. The diet should consist mainly of fresh 
fruit and vegetables and fish with cereals. Fat foods, such as butter, 
cream, eggs and crisp bacon, are desirable. Water should be drunk 
to the extent of 8 or 10 tumblerfuls daily, to promote activity of 
the kidneys. For internal medication morphine should be avoided, for 
the condition is liable to return and the drug habit might be induced. 
Many patients having neuralgia find that they secure temporary 
relief so that they can continue work by taking large doses of aspirin, 
phenacitin, etc. Such remedies, if continued, depress the heart action 
and may cause serious cyanosis. Like the anodynes, they are pal- 
liative merely, not curative, and this should be explained to the 
patient. What is needed is a tonic, upbuilding treatment, with pro- 
motion of elimination of fatigue or other waste products. Abundant 
fresh air, simple, well-digested food, regulation of periods of rest 
and exercise, catharsis and an alkaline diuretic afford the most sen- 
sible means of cure. In many occupations neuralgias are not so 
much due to a specific poison, even when such risk is present, but 
to the subsidiary factors of fatigue, worry, poor air, lack of a normal 
amount of exercise, etc. In cases distinctly due to indigestion and 
constipation, as many of them are, the use of catharsis should be 
supplemented by mix vomica and dilute hydrochloric acid, if there be 
hypoacidity of the gastric juice, or the rhubarb and soda mixture if 
the reverse is the case. If intestinal flatulence is present, salol 
(gr. v., t. i. d.) may be given, or two or three minims of beechwood 



540 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

creosote in capsule. In many cases of neuralgia, as of neurasthenia, 
the trouble arises quite as much from home conditions as from those 
which are occupational, and this fact should be borne in mind and 

investigated. 

NEURITIS 

Neuritis and perineuritis may affect either sensory or motor 
nerves, and may or may not be accompanied by paralysis. They 
may be caused by trauma, toxic materials in the blood, or simply 
by overuse and fatigue of the nerves. The inflammation, when 
traumatic, usually affects a single nerve or nerve group, but, if toxic, 
may affect many nerves, as' in multiple neuritis from arsenical pois- 
oning. 

An analysis, in 1911, by Dr. W. E. Paul of 200 cases of occu- 
pational neuroses and neuritis demonstrated that the larger number 
of such cases are not due to cortical fatigue or irritation, but to 
such peripheral injuries of nerves and muscles as result from squeez- 
ing, impact, tension, exhaustion from over-functioning, etc. Such 
injuries induce myolytic or *neurolytic changes, and through them 
also affect the joints, tendons and fascia. Pains produced in this 
manner are very often located in or around the joints, movement of 
which intensifies them. 

Localized neuritis with muscular atrophy following overwork of 
special muscle groups is described by many neurologists as occurring 
occasionally in such occupations as those of tailor's presser, black- 
smith, leather worker, etc. Friedreich observed it in a dragoon who 
held the reins of his horse taut, and Scheuppel mentions it in a 
musician who played upon a bass viol. A case of clap drummer's 
paralysis resulting from occupational neuritis was reported by Dr. 
C. J. Aldrich in the Medical News, Feb. 7, 1903. A woman in my 
clinic acquired neuritis of the middle finger from its constant use 
in pressing a needle in the work of cotton embroidery. 

The various degrees of occupational neuritis may involve either 
interstitial or parenchyniatous changes in the nerve, or the inflam- 
matory process may be around the nerve or in its sheath a perineu- 
ritis. In many cases trauma is followed by degeneration in the nerve 
without a true inflammatory process. 



THE NERVES 541 

In acute types of neuritis, if the lesion be severe, hyperemia and 
extravasation of blood take place, and leukocytes penetrate into the 
fibrous network of the nerve. In the chronic cases there is more or 
less connective tissue increase in the nerve sheath and the bundles 
which surround the nerve filaments. 

Multiple neuritis affects usually the peripheral motor or sensory 
nerves, or both, and results from such occupational poisons as arsenic, 
lead, anilin, carbon monoxid and bisulphid, phosphorus and mercury. 
The several types are described under the appropriate headings. 
The severer types of neuritis, in which the inflammation may as- 
sume a purulent or gangrenous form, do not often result from simple 
occupational causes. 

In the multiple neuritis cases occurring among workmen chronic 
alcoholism is not only a strong predisposing factor, but may be the 
only one. Thus, if a worker in lead or arsenic be a hard drinker, 
he is much more liable to acquire a multiple neuritis than if he 
were non-alcoholic. 

Multiple neuritis due to the chemical poisons is commonly of 
very chronic type, being slow in onset, in progress and subsidence. 
Pains in the arms and legs and aching sensations are complained of. 
Gradually the power to grip tools firmly or other loss of manual 
strength is noticed. There may be areas along the course of the 
nerve trunks which are hypersensitive or painful to the touch. 
Vasomotor disturbances may be present, the skin looking red or 
moderately edematous. The muscles of the forearms, arms and 
calves of the legs become flaccid. The muscle pains increase and 
atrophy ensues, with diminished response to both galvanic and faradic 
currents. The reflexes of the skin and tendons at the knees and 
elbows are lessened or absent. The transmission of pain, temper- 
ature and tactile impressions is much diminished or retarded. Ex- 
cept in some cases of lead poisoning the occupational cases of mul- 
tiple neuritis rarely appear to affect the visceral nerves. The periph- 
eral nerves show early changes in electrical reaction with diminu- 
tion in response to faradic and especially galvanic stimulation. In 
the later stages reaction of degeneration may be present. In an- 
terior poliomyelitis, on the contrary, loss of response to galvanism 



542 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

develops much more slowly. In the later stages hyperesthesia may 
give place to anesthesia. Paresthesia is common and the patient may 
complain of numbness in the hands or feet and sensations of prickling, 
burning, etc. The sphincters are almost never affected in occupa- 
tional neuritis, and the nerves of special sense are rarely affected, 
although the optic and auditory nerves are exceptionally involved. 
Of all the symptoms the most common are pain in the extremities, 
particularly in the arms and hands, muscle tenderness, paralysis, 
muscle atrophy, and early diminution in electric reaction. 

Multiple neuritis of toxic origin differs from diffuse or trans- 
verse myelitis by the more gradual onset and progress with sensory 
disturbances, greater tendency to muscle atrophy, muscle tenderness 
and anesthesia in excess of cutaneous anesthesia. In myelitis, more- 
over, there is tendency to development of bedsores and disturbances 
of sphincteric action. Alcoholic neuritis more often involves the legs 
in greater degree than does multiple neuritis of toxic 'origin in which 
foot-drop is seldom combined with wrist-drop and cerebral symptoms 
are often present in the alcoholic cases. 

Treatment. At the beginning of an attack of neuritis, whether 
it be localized or multiple, the first requisite is complete rest of the 
affected muscles and nerves. In localized neuritis the limb should 
be supported and prevented from voluntary motion. In the multiple 
form the patient should rest in bed. The pains may be mitigated 
by gentle applications of menthol liniment (1^ Menthol, chloral 
aa 3i, alcohol, aquas camphorae aa ii) or ointment of methyl salicylate 
in lanolin. After such applications, to be made twice a day, the 
limb should be wrapped in cotton wool. In some cases hot stupes 
give relief, applied every hour or two. Aspirin (gr. v) and 
sodium salicylate (gr. xx) may be given three or four times a day. 
General restlessness may be quieted by codein. After the acutely 
painful stage has passed and muscular atrophy appears, perhaps in 
4 or 5 weeks, gentle massage, hot and cold douches, and 5 or 6 
milliamperes of galvanic current may be applied daily. Strychnin 
and arsenic may be given internally. Persistent paralysis or con- 
tractures demand passive exercises, and the use of appropriate splints 
or rubber bands so applied as to reinforce voluntary muscular effort. 



THE NEKVES 543 



NEURITIS WITH ATROPHY OF THE INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF 

THE HAND 

In the various pressure injuries of peripheral nerves of the hand 
paralyses are more liable to result than sensory disturbances. Such 
injuries affect metal turners and polishers, jewelers, diamond cut- 
ters, and those whose work necessitates frequent alternate grasping 
and letting go of handles or other parts of machinery requiring 
pressure. Professional cyclists, accustomed to grasp and lean on the 
handles of their machines, have occasionally developed this form of 
neuritis. The pressure may be myopathic in its results, i. e., it may 
cause a myositis with atrophy or it may be neural as well, acting 
through injury to the nerves innervating the muscles. Overactivity or 
oft-repeated muscular actions may result in similarly localized par- 
alyses and atrophy, but in such cases there are accompanying sensory 
phenomena, such as pain, cramp and paresthesia or anesthesia. Toxic 
conditions, such as poisoning by lead, arsenic, alcohol, etc., may also 
cause or strongly predispose to this type of neuromuscular lesion. 

Neuritis of the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve is due to 
continued mechanical pressure in the palm or forefinger and thumb. 
Dr. J. Ramsay Hunt has described the affection and reported 3 
cases in the Cornell University Medical Bulletin, vol. 1, No. 2, 1911. 
One patient was a jeweler who grasped articles firmly with the left 
forefinger and thumb which he filed with the right hand. The 
resulting atrophy of the muscles of the left hand innervated by the 
ulnar nerve is shown in the accompanying photograph of this case 
(Fig. 100). The marked atrophy is seen in the first interosseous 
space. The second patient was in the habit of grasping a machine 
handle firmly and repeatedly with the right hand, involving pressure 
with flexion alternating with relaxation. He acquired paralysis of 
the hypothenar, interosseous and adductor pollicis muscles, which be- 
gan after a few days' work. The third patient was a brass polisher 
who acquired similar paralyses with reactions of degeneration. 

In all these cases the sensations of touch, pain and temperature 
remained unaltered, and the paralysis, atrophy and reactions of 



544 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

degeneration localized to the distribution of the muscular deep palmar 
branch of the ulnar nerve made the condition, according to Hunt, a 
distinct occupational disease. One or two of the patients had slight 
subjective sensory disturbances, such as pain in the arm and numb- 
ness or prickling of the fingers. Hunt further points out the re- 




FIG. 100. OCCUPATION NEURITIS OF THE DEEP PALMAR BRANCH OF THE ULNAR 
NERVE. Atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the left hand shown. (Case

xxxv, 673.) 

semblance to the much more extensive Aran-Duchenne muscular 
atrophies due to spinal cord lesion, but in the disease which he de- 
scribes the limitation of the affected area to the original pressure 
area is very distinctive, the area supplied by the median nerve 
remaining normal, whereas in the Aran-Duchenne type of atrophy 
this latter area is early involved, the symptoms are progressive, not 
limited, there are fibrillary twitchings and different electrical reac- 
tions. "All other neuritic forms of occupation atrophy of the hands 
are characterized by definite subjective and objective sensory dis- 
turbances." 



THE NERVES 545 

Herrmann Gessler, in 1896, reported a similar type of hand 
lesion in gold polishers in Wiirttemberg, which Hunt regards as 
belonging in the same category with his own cases, i. e., due to 
pressure upon motor nerve branches in the hand. In one of Gessler's 
cases, that of a young woman, after 2 years of work as a gold 
polisher she became unable to extend or separate the little and ring 
fingers of the right hand. The hand was cyanosed and cold to the 
touch. The intrinsic muscles of the hand showed advanced atrophy. 
She was finally obliged to abandon the work. 

SCIATICA 

i 

Sciatica results from both toxic and traumatic occupational haz- 
ards. Thus it has been observed in cases of lead and arsenic poison- 
ing and as a result of repeated blows or vibrations, as in locomotive 
engineers (See page 548), or from the cramped positions assumed 
by those who sit cross-legged, like tailors, or who stoop much, or 
kneel and sit upon the haunches, like workmen who scrape and clean 
hardwood floors or lay mosaic flooring, etc. 

The onset of the symptoms is sudden, consisting of severe cramp- 
like pain felt in the thigh posteriorly and following the course of 
the nerve down the leg. The pain may radiate upward to the lumbar 
region of the affected side. It is usually unilateral, but, when occu- 
pational, may be bilateral. Motion greatly intensifies the pain, and 
the patient seeks relief by posture, tilting the pelvis toward the 
unaffected side, and inclining the torso toward the affected side. 
The pain soon becomes severe and continuous, with paroxysms of 
lancinating, burning character. There are various sensory dis- 
turbances, such as formication, numbness, coldness or weight. Spe- 
cial points of tenderness on pressure are elicited over the sciatic 
notch, at the knee posteriorly, in the middle of the thigh posteriorly, 
at the middle of the gastrocnemius, behind the external malleolus and 
dorsum of the foot. If the extended leg be raised, severe pain is 
felt in the sciatic notch, or, if the leg be partially extended while 
pressure is made at the back of the knee, pain is felt along the back' 
of the thigh. These two latter phenomena are diagnostic (Dana). 



546 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

In chronic cases muscular atrophy follows disuse. The affected leg 
shows vasomotor disturbances and is relatively cold to the touch. 

The lesion is a perineuritis (page 540) and has a great tendency 
to chronicity, often lasting for weeks or months in varying intensity. 

Treatment. The limb should be fastened to a long splint ex- 
tending from the foot to the axilla in such manner as to admit of 
local treatment without disturbance. The latter should consist of 
applications of the thermocautery and hot poultices. Later blisters 
may be applied over some of the more tender points, or anodyne 
liniments, such as chloroform or belladonna liniment, may be used. 
Free mercurial purgation is desirable, and in some cases phenacetin 
or antipyrin (gr. x) gives relief. At the onset it may be neces- 
sary to use morphin hypodermatically for a few days, but this should 
not be continued. Dana recommends bandaging the leg after apply- 
ing sulphur ointment with menthol. Convalescence may be promoted 
by massage and the use of the galvanic current, one pole being held 
at the sciatic notch while the other is moved over the course of the 
nerve. Baking the leg in a hot-air box is another remedy suitable 
for subacute and chronic cases. The cases of occupational origin 
rarely require the extreme measures of acupuncture or nerve 
stretching. 

OCCUPATIONAL NEUROSES IN GENERAL 

Under this title are grouped an increasingly large number of 
neuromuscular affections arising from strain, repeated shock or con- 
stant overuse of the nerves and muscles induced by special occupa- 
tions which may involve unskilled labor, but which, in the majority 
of cases, are connected with occupations demanding intelligence and 
skill. Dr. Charles L. Dana, in a clinical study of a series of 97 
cases ("The Occupational Neuroses," Ned. Record, March 9, 1912. 
p. 45), says that "with each new form of mechanical invention which 
calls for skilled manual labor some new occupational neurosis arises." 
Many cases, however, occur in time-honored occupations, such, for 
example, as the milker's cramp, etc. 

A general classification of these neuroses includes: pains; neu- 



THE NERVES 547 

ritis; muscular atrophy; cramps, symptomatic and professional; 
acroparesthesia. These disorders frequently exist in combination; 
thus pains are often a symptom of neuritis, and neuritis is often ac- 
companied by atrophy and sensory disturbances. 

In this group of 87 cases Dana found the symptoms distributed 
as follows : 

Median nerve neuritis 10 

Musculospiral neuritis 2 

Circumflex neuritis 2 

Peroneal neuritis 2 

Atrophy of hand and arm 9 

Brachialgia 20 

Acroparesthesia of hand 8 

Symptomatic cramps 6 

Genuine occupation cramps 23 

Sciatic nerve pains 3 

Torticollis 2 

Total 87 

This group of cases was distributed among a long list of diverse 
occupations, as follows : pressers and ironers, tailors, carpenters, 
cigarmakers, jewelers, barbers, seamstresses, sewing machine oper- 
ators, stone cutters, elevator boys, paper box makers, lithographers 
(stone polishers), miniature painters, lathers, machinists, bookkeep- 
ers, stenographers and typewriters, clerks, surgeons, laryngologists, 
dentists, violinists, milkers, pianists, flute players, auctioneers, pav- 
ers, housewives, bookbinders, modelers, drummers. To this list may 
be added cobblers, masons, laundresses, porters or others carrying 
heavy weights on the shoulders. 

Among the occupational neuroses a large group comprises the 
skilled use of the hand in writing, and what may be called accessory 
occupations to writing (See page 557), such as those of stenographers, 
telegraphers and typewriters. A considerable group is constituted 
by musicians, such as pianists and violinists. Another large group 
is found among garment workers, such as tailors, seamstresses and 



548 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

ironers or pressers. It may further roughly be estimated that fully 
90 per cent, or more of the neuroses involve the nerves and muscles 
of the hand and arm. Other nerves occasionally affected as a result 
of carrying heavy weights on the shoulders are the musculospiral, 
circumflex and long thoracic. The cranial nerves may present occu- 
pational cramps or tics, as observed rarely in players on wind instru- 
ments, in which case there is overuse of the facial nerve branches. 
Dana reports a case of torticollis in a bookbinder, occasioned by 
rhythmical movements of the neck while at work. 

The nerves of the legs are sometimes affected by neuroses, as 
when there is constant use of the leg in working a sewing machine 
pedal or other form of pedal. Motormen who stamp on a gong 
pedal may suffer in this manner. "Squatting" down upon the knees, 
as in the occupation of weeding flowers and vegetables, causes the 
biceps femoris tendon to compress the peroneal nerve against the 
head of the fibula, and in time pain, cramp, and possibly paralysis 
may ensue. Tailors who sit upon their crossed legs may have similar 
trouble. 

Dr. David L. Edsall, writing of this topic in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association, quotes an experience of Dr. Latta, 
chief of the Pennsylvania Railroad Relief Association, who found 
that an exceptionally large number of locomotive engineers suffered 
from sciatica of the right leg, due to sitting on a bench sidewise, with 
the left leg hanging free and the weight of the body resting on the 
right hip while subjected to constant jolting. The ends of the 
benches were cut off to enable the men to sit squarely while facing 
forward, and further cases ceased to develop. 

Motor bus drivers who are constantly pressing with the right 
foot to start the machine may suffer from sciatica and lumbago. 
The jarring of the machine may be a contributing element. Bur- 
roughs has described a case in which there was severe pain after 
each day's work in the right leg and lumbar region, intensified by 
motion and pressure. There was also hyperesthesia, so that the 
patient could not tolerate the weight of the bedclothing or lie on the 
right side. 

Those whose work comprises the firm grasp of tools in the hand, 



THE NERVES 549 

especially to make pressure or pound, frequently suffer from neuroses. 
Neuroses of the hand and arm usually begin with the symptom of 
increasing fatigue after prolonged use, which soon is accompanied by 
neuralgic pain. At first relieved by intervals of rest, the pain later 
becomes constant, or is excited by increasingly brief periods of use 
of the hand and arm, until the worker can endure the work no longer, 
and the symptoms may last for weeks or months after the work has 
been abandoned. The pains may be accompanied by points of tender- 
ness on, pressure along the nerve trunks and by subjective sensory 
disturbances such as numbness and formication. In some cases these 
symptoms are more complained of than pain, which is not neces- 
sarily excessive, or which is only evoked by use of the limb. 

The ulnar and median nerve, according to Dana, are affected in 
like proportion singly, and rarely are simultaneously involved. An 
illustration of repeated monotonous muscular effort is given by 
W. C. Garrison, which was observed by him in a large industrial 
establishment in ISTew Jersey. Here "the flooring of pine boards an 
inch and a half thick has to be renewed in front of certain machines 
once a year, because the operator's feet, from its being necessary to 
stand in one position constantly, wear their way completely through 
the boards, leaving, in their gradual descent, apertures the exact 
shape of his shoes and of a size not more than a couple of inches 
larger." He has also seen "steel and cast iron levers which actuated 
some of the machinery worn completely through by the constantly 
recurring grasp of the workman's hands." This author uses these 
illustrations rather to emphasize monotony of work than neuroses, 
but the latter readily develop under similar conditions. 

Acroparesthesias arise from repeated or continued pressure upon 
the peripheral sensory and vasomotor nerves of the hand, as well as 
from exposure to moisture, heat and cold. The resulting sensory 
symptoms include burning, tingling and numbness, and the vasomotor 
disturbances comprise redness and swelling. In such cases pain and 
loss of muscular power are frequently wanting. Laundresses suffer 
sometimes from paresthesia of the hands, such as sensations of 
numbness, burning, tingling, etc., or from redness and swelling of 
the hands, induced by the trauma of hard scrubbing upon a board, 



550 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

by continued moisture and alternating heat and cold. Sewing 
women who work perpetually on the same type of garment, repeating 
identical motions again and again, may acquire paresthesia of the 
fingers and thumb of the right hand (Margonnier), with stiffness of 
the right arm. From this cause Kron has described cases of ulnar 
neuritis with atrophy of the interossei supplied by the branches of 
this nerve (See also page 540). 

The occupational cramps may be of central origin, like the vari- 
ous tic spasms, or of peripheral origin. Dana states that in his 
experience "the true types are all of central origin, but there are 
often symptomatic cramps occurring in the brachialgias, or aching 
arms, and often some symptomatic cramps are associated with neu- 
ritis." 

The above described neuroses are many of them traumatic, in the 
sense that they are due to pressure, blows, vibrations, etc., in com- 
bination with oft-repeated muscular contractions. Others of them 
arise from the latter cause alone and without trauma of any signifi- 
cance. A third group of cases comprises those which are more 
definitely known as the "traumatic neuroses," and which are not 
necessarily occupational, or are so only in a modified sense. Such, 
for example, is the "railway-spine" condition which may follow a 
general jarring of the body received by a passenger in a railway 
collision. But in many industries, especially where cutting, grind- 
ing or stamping machinery is in use, the workman may receive an 
accidental surgical injury, as the partial loss of a limb, laceration 
of flesh, etc., which produces a severe general nerve shock that may 
beget tremors, cramp, atrophy and other nerve symptoms of more or 
less local character, or, as is very often the case, may produce a 
condition of serious neurasthenia or hysteria. The latter may be 
accompanied by inability, either fancied or real, to resume work 
which exerts a very depressing mental influence, amounting in ex- 
treme cases almost to melancholia. Where workmen, or especially 
working girls, are crowded together in large numbers calamities such 
as those of fire, explosion, a falling building, etc., may so alarm 
those who are in no wise physically injured that serious neuroses 
and neurasthenia result. There were many such cases among the 



THE NERVES 551 

girl operatives who barely escaped with their lives from a recent 
calamitous fire in a shirtwaist factory in New York in which many 
others perished before their eyes. Several of these patients came 
to my clinic. An illustration of an extreme case, where a man met 
his ultimate death as a result, not of his own occupation, but of 
seeing another man die from an occupational hazard, is the fol- 
lowing : 

A man, 52 years of age, was brought to my service in the New 
York Hospital in 1889, unconscious, in an ambulance. When he 
came to his senses it transpired that the day before he had witnessed 
the horrible fatal roasting in midair of a lineman who fell across some 
electric light wires. Subsequently, while walking under a telegraph 
pole, another lineman cut a wire which fell near the patient, brushing 
off the latter's hat. The patient, thinking himself shocked to death, 
fell to the ground and became unconscious. Subsequently he became 
very weak, had partial paralysis of the right arm and leg, with pain 
and constant tremors. He had also hemianesthesia of the face and 
limbs and hemianopsia, sat brooding for hours at a time, became con- 
tinuously weaker, refused nourishment, and finally, after several 
months, despite all treatment, both mental and physical, he died. It 
was proved beyond question in court that there was no current passing 
over the wire at the time it fell, and that in falling it did not even 
strike the man, but only knocked off his stiff hat It often happens 
that after the shock of an escape from a burning building, or a steam- 
boat or railway collision, or falling in an elevator, the victim may 
present no bruises or injuries immediately following, but after a 
period of days or weeks begins to manifest all the symptoms of pro- 
found nervous shock. It is as if, being originally well, the inertia of 
health carries him along a certain period of time and then he col- 
lapses, with muscular weakness, feeble circulation, failing nutrition, 
great mental depression, and often vague imaginings of internal in- 
juries. Death such as that in the case above cited is unusual, but 
recovery almost always is exceedingly slow and taxes all the re- 
sources of physician and friends, for the treatment must be largely 
psychic. 

The occupational neuroses may be accompanied by dyspepsia, a 



552 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISOEDEES 

slightly quickened pulse rate, vasomotor disturbances, diminution 
of sexual vigor, insomnia and irritability. 

Prevention. Most of the occupational neuroses are preventable 
by very simple precautions. Where pressure or repeated hammering 
blows are the cause, the use of properly adjusted pads or cushions, 
or occasional change in method of holding a tool or instrument, may 
be all that is necessary. In other cases frequent periods of rest 
with massage or douching of the hand and arm, with alternately 
applied hot and cold water, may avert both pains and cramps. The 
education of opposing groups of muscles is of service in some cases. 

Dana urges the more frequent use of the left hand and arm by 
tailor's pressers and those engaged in similar occupations, in order 
to rest the right arm and thereby lessen the danger of atrophies, 
neuralgias and paralyses. 

Treatment. When pain is a serious feature, anodyne liniments 
may be useful, such as I Chloral and menthol, aa 3i, alcohol, 
aquae camphorse, aa ii. Or the linimentum camphorae, belladonnas 
or saponis may be used. The gentle massage of rubbing in the 
liniment is useful. In some cases the Paquelin cautery is helpful. 
When muscular weakness or atrophy is present stimulating appli- 
cations of mustard water and the galvanic battery may be employed 
with advantage to promote artificial exercise of the affected muscles 
and stimulate their circulation; 5 to 10 milliamperes of current 
strength may be used for 10 to 15 minutes once or twice a day. The 
anode should be placed upon the spine over the origin of the affected 
nerves and the cathode moved along their periphery. The general 
health should be cared for and the patient should be encouraged in 
the belief that recovery is possible. 

WRITER'S CRAMP 

Writer's cramp, called also "scrivener's palsy," is neither a true 
cramp, being often non-painful, nor a true palsy, being usually unac- 
companied by actual loss of power, but consists rather of a chronic 
spasmodic motor disturbance in the muscles used for writing. It is 
a neurosis resulting from fatigue, and the spasm is induced by 



THE NEEVES 553 

volition, i. e., resuming attempts at writing. It occurs often in 
persons who are perfectly well and not necessarily neurasthenic or 
neurotic, and is induced by long-continued writing, particularly 
where the same words are often repeated, as in signing a long series 
of documents of some kind or repeating columns of figures. Writer's 
cramp is favored by sitting in a confined position, with lack of 
freedom for arm and hand sweep, by using too hard or fine a pen 
which requires careful guidance and pressure. The pen should be 
held by those who write much with the easy position of an artist's 
brush, and never grasped with undue firmness. Attention should be 
given in writing to an easy position of all the fingers, not only those 
which support the pen directly. Its handle should not be allowed 
to slip down in the groove between thumb and forefinger, but kept 
well up toward the head of the first phalanx of the forefinger. When 
the old-time elastic quill was in general use this form of cramp was 
less prevalent than at present. Pencils also are less likely than 
hard steel pens to cause cramp. Writing under excessive strain or 
worry and when in ill health from any cause, if carried on for many 
hours each day, favors the development of cramp. The condition 
is more common among men than women, mainly because the latter, 
generally speaking, make less reliable clerks from the physical point 
of view, and hence there are fewer of them. 

Pathology. As there are no autopsy records of a functional con- 
dition of this sort, the pathology and morbid anatomy, if there be 
any, are unknown. C. L. Dana declares that "it is a neurosis having 
no appreciable anatomical basis." Different writers, in speculating 
upon the matter, claim for the pathology changes in the muscles, 
peripheral nerves, spinal cord and motor areas of the brain respec- 
tively. Overstimulation of the neuromuscular apparatus with fa- 
tigue phenomena appeals to J. H. Lloyd and others, but Dana argues 
that writing is such a complex "acquired automatic movement that 
it must have as its anatomical basis a certain established arrangement 
of the nerve-cell groups in the cervical part of the spinal cord," and 
"in writer's cramp the spinal group of cells are more or less used up 
or exhausted, and the motor impulse [from the cerebral cortex] 
which naturally would innervate them, strikes cells which respond 



554 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

unequally, or it overflows to other cell groups, hence the spasmodic, 
irregular movements." In some cases, too, he believes the cerebral 
centers in the cortex or basal ganglia may become exhausted and 
functionate irregularly. 

Symptoms. The symptoms develop very slowly, often amounting 
to no more than a sense of undue fatigue after prolonged writing, or 
slight numbness of the fingers. From this indefinite onset, which 
may last for months if the occupation be persisted in, the case pro- 
gresses to a condition in which the pen becomes entirely uncon- 
trollable. 

The symptoms vary in intensity and may not all be present 
simultaneously in the same case, at least not with equal prominence. 
There are tonic spasm and incoordination ; anesthesia and vasomotor 
disturbance may be observed, but pain and paralysis, as stated above, 
are not present in all cases, and paralysis is not apt to occur, if at 
all, until the ailment has lasted a long time. Statements vary as 
to the number of cases in which the pronator and supinator muscles 
of the wrist are involved; probably, however, they are not in more 
than a tenth of all the cases. The non-painful spasm seizes the finger 
muscles at the moment of grasping the pen so that they stand apart 
rigid, and it cannot voluntarily be overcome. If the victim en- 
deavors to hold the pen with other groups of muscles than those 
customarily employed, as between the first and second finger, for 
instance, he writes clumsily for a time, being unable to coordinate, 
and soon the muscles last used become involved with spasm. Other 
movements of fine coordination of the fingers such as threading a 
needle usually can be made, but movements like those made in pill 
rolling or cigarette rolling may be interrupted by spasm. A few 
patients can learn to write with the left hand. Some persons acquire 
a habit in ordinary writing of keeping other muscles than those of 
the hand tense, as in slight tension of the foot, muscles of the mouth, 
or more often the right arm. When they acquire writer's cramp, 
these other muscles may be affected slightly by spasm, sympa- 
thetically. 

True tremor is rarely present in the writing muscles. When 
observed it is of the "intention" type, commencing when the patient 



THE NERVES 555 

begins to write and having a more rapid and more restricted oscilla- 
tion than that which characterizes multiple disseminated sclerosis. 
But the grosser irregular movements of incoordination, choreiform 
in type, are characteristic and on passively moving the fingers there 
is marked spasticity. 

In the later stage of excessive spasm, some of the affected muscles 
may become paretic, but this condition is rare and usually belongs, 
rather to hysteria, or some other form of disease like muscular 
atrophy, not originating in the fatigue neurosis of the typical writer's 
cramp. 

Pain, formication or numbness may be felt at the onset of the 
symptoms, but these sensations may be absent throughout or develop 
only after the ailment is well advanced. Occasionally areas of 
cutaneous hyperesthesia are observed, but anesthesia is not often 
present except in hysterical patients. 

Vasomotor disturbance is not uncommon and the fingers may 
become hyperemic or cyanosed and temporarily slightly swollen. Hy- 
peremia of the skin of the face and of the neck on the affected side 
has been reported. 

Electrical reactions are often intensified in the muscles involved, 
but the reaction of degeneration is wanting. 

In some cases, more particularly in neurotic patients, who be- 
come worried over the interruption caused to their work, apprehen- 
sive hypochondriasis and emotional disturbances may be induced 
by the local phenomena. 

Many neurologists are disposed to subdivide the cases of writer's 
cramp, according to their predominating features, into: (a) the 
spastic form, affecting mainly the flexors of the fingers, or sometimes 
of the thumb or one finger alone, with spasm and incoordination; 
(b) the neuralgic or neuritic form, in which to the preceding type 
are added: fatigue, pain and areas of tenderness extending up the 
forearm ; (c) the tremor form in which this symptom predominates ; 
(d) the paralytic form in which the pen cannot be held by the fingers 
at all. This type is more often a phenomenon of some other disease, 
such as hysteria. 

Diagnosis. Diagnosis is usually simple, based on the nature of 



556 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

the occupation and peculiarly localized spasm unaccompanied by 
atrophy or reaction of degeneration. It should be observed that 
other forms of nerve disorder, such as occur in commencing general 
paresis, ataxia, progressive muscular atrophy, toxic neuritis due to 
alcohol, lead or arsenic, etc., chorea and other types of neuritis, when 
occurring in one whose chief occupation is writing, may evince an 
early preponderance of symptoms in the hand. In most of these 
instances some degree of bilateral involvement is apparent, and the 
progressive and more extensive evolution of the symptoms soon 
solves the diagnosis. In hysteria with localized spasm and inco- 
ordination the psychic symptoms usually predominate. Moreover 
in the hysterical cases the spasms are excited in other ways in ad- 
dition to the action of writing. 

Prognosis. Improvement usually follows treatment, but many 
cases are very slow in manifesting it, and there is decided tendency 
to relapse with subsequent overuse of the muscles involved. Much 
depends upon undertaking treatment early and upon the patient's 
ability to take a long rest from the occupation. Complete cure is 
possible in the milder cases. 

Prevention, Prevention is best secured through a proper system 
of free-hand writing without shading and without resting the wrist 
or little finger in a fixed position on the desk. When a long series 
of copying names is necessary, as in signing thousands of bonds or 
certificates, it is well to rest the hand for a few minutes every half 
hour, and massage of the hand and arm combined with hot water 
douching aids in removing the products of waste of muscular activity 
and greatly lessens fatigue. Moreover, pains should be taken in all 
such cases to secure a soft pen and a fairly thick penholder with a 
cork or rubber tip, so that as much advantage as possible may be 
gained from elasticity. In some cases the substitution of a quill or 
soft gold pen for the hard steel pen is effective. Smooth paper is 
better than rough when much writing is done. Good light, an easy 
general posture at the desk, or changing from a standing to a sitting 
desk, or vice versa, cuffs which do not cramp free movements of the 
wrist, and placing the paper at an oblique angle rather than a right 
angle, are all minor matters which merit attention by those who 



THE NEEVES 557 

spend many hours daily in writing. As far as possible worry and 
"speeding up" are to be avoided. 

Treatment. As much rest as possible should be secured, even if 
it may consist only in five-minute interruptions of work. Pens and 
pen holders should be changed until the least fatiguing are secured. 
Obvious errors in position should be overcome. Some patients are 
aided by wearing rubber wrist bands attached by similar bands to 
the fingers. Finger splints and large, almost globular attachments 
to the penholder, to be held in the palm, aid some patients. Instru- 
ments have been devised to fasten the pen to the forefinger at the 
side, or above the fingers. Massage, douching, finger gymnastics, 
active and passive, the use of the Zander apparatus, are all pro- 
cedures which have proved successful in some cases. The daily use 
of the galvanic current is also serviceable. The anode is placed 
at the back of the neck and the cathode moved over the fingers. 
Dana recommends a current of 5 to 10 milliamperes for 10 to 15 
minutes. For pain, rubbing with anodyne liniments and the ther- 
mocautery may be employed. Changing to the use of a typewriter 
exercises the fingers in a manner sometimes beneficial. Drug treat- 
ment is useless. 

Influencing many of the occupational cramps, tics and spasms 
there is often a strong psychic factor. Thus a man with telegrapher's 
or writer's cramp may become convinced that he is unable to control 
his muscles to perform certain coordinate movements with the hand, 
while others, equally complex, are performed with ease. In these 
cases much benefit accrues from psychic treatment directed to re- 
assure the patient that his trouble is not permanent or organic. 

TELEGRAPHER'S CRAMP 

This cramp originates in the same manner as writer's cramp 
from overuse and pressure made with the fingers upon the telegraph 
key, but is more liable to affect the extensors than the flexors as in 
the writer's neurosis. The key of the Morse instrument is held by 
the thumb, fore and middle finger, and the movements comprise alter- 
nating downward pressure and uplift of the key. The flexors of 



558 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDEKS 

the wrist are involved and sometimes the muscles of the forearm. It 
has been estimated by Fulton that a rapid operator may make 30,000 
to 40,000 movements per hour, often working six or eight hours a 
day. Many operators have also to write a great deal and writer's 
cramp may be combined with telegrapher's. The neurosis of telegra- 
phers is almost always markedly spasmodic in type and begins slowly, 
with difficulty and fatigue in making particular code letters. The 
extensor spasm finally draws the fingers from the key and wrist from 
the table (Lloyd). There are no atrophy, tremor, or anesthesia, and 
pain is not usually as prominent a feature as in writer's cramp. 

Treatment. Treatment is practically the same as that of writer's 
cramp described on page 557, and although the writer cannot change 
the form of instrument he often can adopt other positions of the 
fingers or learn to use the left hand. 

SPASM OF EXCEPTIONAL ORIGIN 

Localized spasm in single muscles or groups of muscles arises 
in many occupations as a fatigue neurosis. Such spasm is greatly 
influenced by mental states, being accentuated by emotion, embar- 
rassment under observation, etc. It is of either chronic or tonic type, 
usually the former ; the onset is slow. At first occurring only under 
the stimulus of use of the muscles or of excitement, it later becomes 
more constant and extends to neighboring muscles. The spasm may 
be accompanied by dull aching or sometimes sharp pain. A favorite 
single muscle to be thus involved is the sternocleidomastoid ; the 
chin being turned to the opposite side and tilted slightly upward. 

A few cases of occupational spasm have been recorded among 
cigarmakers who rolled cigar wrappers with the fingers; drivers 
who held taut reins; ballet dancers having gastrocnemius spasm, 
and spasm of the toes ; smiths employed in stropping knives, sharp- 
ening swords, etc., and using heavy hammers for continuous pound- 
ing (hammer palsy), as in gold-beating, etc.; tailors, with spasm of 
the legs from sitting cross-legged; and seamstresses and shoemakers 
who may acquire spasm of the thumb and forefinger from sewing 
upon unyielding materials, like heavy cloth and leather. 



THE NERVES 559 

Pianists who continuously overexercise certain fingers not rarely 
may suffer from fatigue neuroses, with aching pain, weakness and 
spasm, which may extend to the forearm. Violinists may acquire 
spasms of the fingers of the left hand from firmly pressing upon the 
strings. Such a case has been reported to me by Robert Abbe. 
Flutists have been known to acquire laryngeal spasm and players 
on wind instruments to acquire spasm of the tongue and laryngeal 
muscles. 

Overuse of the voice in public speaking or singing, street-crying, 
etc., may give rise, exceptionally, to laryngeal spasm, tremor and 
paresis, with resulting aphonia. Sudden spasmodic closure of the 
glottis and incoordination of the vocal cords result. 

Typewriters may acquire pain and spasm in the muscles of the 
fore and middle fingers of both hands. Arlidge refers to a pressure 
contracture of the little finger in engravers, and also backward sub- 
luxation of the thumb. 

Auctioneers and conductors of orchestras may acquire spasm in 
the muscles of the right arm and shoulder from the continuous repe- 
tition of certain motions. 

Spasm and cramp of the muscles of the foot have occurred in 
chauffeurs who constantly use pedals and in those who work ma- 
chine stamps by tripping a pedal. 

Boiler riveters formerly acquired spasm and paralysis of the 
hands sometimes, but this work is so largely done by machine ham- 
mers at the present time that such cases are rarely met with. 

Spasm of the flexors of both hands and fingers occurs in milkers. 
According to Dana it is extremely rare, occurs in milkmaids only, 
not in men, but one of my cases of occupation neurosis was that of 
a man of thirty-five years who was in the habit daily of milking 
fifteen to eighteen cows before breakfast on cold winter mornings. 
He suffered from fatigue and pains in the hands and forearms with 
marked spasm on attempting to milk. He was obliged to abandon 
the work for a long period. 

Dr. Thro brought to my attention the case of a woman who for 
twenty-five years had worked in a hat factory fastening bands inside 
of the hats. She acquired the habit of moving the head around to 



560 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDEES 

follow rotation of the hats in fitting the bands. As she grew older 
and more subject to fatigue, she acquired painful spasm in the mus- 
cles employed in rotation of the head whenever she attempted work, 
finally became neurasthenic and in consequence of the severe cramp- 
like pain was obliged to abandon the work. 

Annandale has reported a case of occupational spasm in a young 
girl weaver, whose work in following the movements of the machine 
caused frequent rotation of the head. When turning toward the left 
she developed clonic spasm and torticollis. 

Treatment. Treatment of these conditions involves the measures 
described for the treatment of the occupational neuroses in general 
described upon page 552. 

GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL NEUROSES 

Many forms of occupation give rise to gastric and intestinal 
neuroses, with alterations in the quantity and quality of the diges- 
tive secretions, alterations in mobility and pain, such as gastralgia 
or enteralgia. In some cases they are the outcome purely of fatigue 
which exhausts nerve energy and inhibits secretion and retards diges- 
tion. Sometimes they originate in irregularity in meal hours, or 
insufficient time for the noon meal. In still other cases they are the 
outcome of the strain and worry of "speeding up," etc. Such causes 
are very often operative among garment workers, laundresses, and 
workers in the textile mills. 

In another group of cases they are the outcome of acute, or more 
often chronic, poisoning, particularly in the metal industry. The 
inhalation of toxic vapors and fumes may cause them, or they may 
be produced by toxic substances which are swallowed and act directly 
upon the gastric mucosa. Lead poisoning and arsenic poisoning af- 
ford familiar examples of the latter group of cases. 

Treatment. Treatment consists in remedying or removing the 
cause, as far as possible. Attention should be given to deliberate mas- 
tication and avoidance, if possible, of violent muscular effort directly 
after the noon meal. Excessive drinking of cold fluids by those whose 
work makes them perspire freely is to be avoided. Constipation 



THE NERVES 561 

should be treated. Pyloric spasm and hypermobility may often be 
relieved by the tincture of belladonna. Hyperacidity should be 
treated with powders of magnesium carbonate, bismuth and soda, 
or the rhubarb and soda mixture of the pharmacopeia, and the op- 
posite condition is best met by dilute hydrochloric acid with tincture 
of mix vomica with one of the simple bitters, such as tincture of 
gentian or cinchona, given with meals. Intestinal cramps may be 
relieved by an abdominal hot poultice or mustard paste, a hot high 
enema, a dose of castor oil and, if necessary, paregoric and tincture 
of belladonna. 

VASOMOTOR DISORDERS 

Dilatation of the peripheral vessels is produced by inhalation of 
many toxic vapors and fumes, in particular those of the nitrites. In 
the manufacture of nitroglycerin, nitrobenzol, anilin and many 
other similar toxic substances the results may be sudden and 
serious. With other groups of poisons there may be congestion of 
important viscera with serious functional disturbance. In many 
cases of neurasthenia vasoinotor disorders play a prominent part. 
Headache, vertigo, faintness, palpitation and sometimes nausea and 
vomiting are the chief symptoms of these disturbances, in addition 
to either suffusion or pallor of the skin. The special vasomotor 
poisonings are described elsewhere under the appropriate headings. 
In emergency cases with serious faintness, headache, etc., such rem- 
edies as atropin, strychnin and diffusible cardiac stimulants like 
camphor and aromatic spirit of -ammonia are the most useful reme- 
dies. For cerebral congestion with high blood pressure, the use of 
phenacetin, chloral, purges and hot mustard footrbaths is recom- 
mended. 

EFFECTS OF PRESSURE, BLOWS, VIBRATIONS, ETC. 

The local effects of rapidly intermittent pressure, blows and heavy 
jarring or vibrations are referred to in the sections upon the occupa- 
tional neuroses (page 546) and neuritis (page 540). In addition, 
the general jarring of the entire body must be reckoned with. This 



562 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

is experienced particularly by locomotive firemen and engineers and 
men who run heavily laden ill-working freight elevators. The spine, 
and in fact the entire peripheral nervous system, is jarred, and a 
condition of neurasthenia is sometimes developed (page 526). In 
extreme cases nervousness, insomnia and more or less gastro-intestinal 
disorder may result. There may be irregular neuralgic pains in the 
extremities with tremors and an uncertain gait. Such cases are not 
common, but in girls who tend looms or other machinery in textile 
factories where there is incessant jarring of poorly constructed floors 
by multiple machinery neurasthenia is by no means infrequent 

In the Government Printing Office in Washington six cases of 
cyst of the wrist tendons have been recorded among persons employed 
constantly in making firm pressure with the hands to fold heavy 
paper. Attention has lately been called to the constant jarring of 
the arm and even of the entire body by automatic hammers, such as 
are used in boiler riveting, riveting structural iron work and stone 
carving. Such jarring is capable, in time, of producing occupational 
neuroses or neuritis or even paresis of obstinate character. 



III. THE EYES 

EYE STRAIN 

Eye strain, resulting in near-sightedness, is common among those 
employed in adjusting delicate mechanisms, such as watchmakers, 
or who focus the eyes constantly upon etching or engraving plates 
or delicate embroidery and lace making. Much visual strain also 
results among workmen in general who must constantly focus the 
eyes upon small objects near at hand under faulty conditions of 
illumination, by which the light is either too dim or too bright, or is 
made to fall at an injurious angle. An example of this is found in 
the asthenopia of gilders and polishers. The case is recorded of a 
United States Government plate printer who printed 900 sheets a 
night, looking at a bright electroplate, with the result that he acquired 
double retinitis and conjunctivitis. 

Ellice M. Alger, in an article on Occupational Eye Diseases 



THE EYES 563 

(Amer. Labor Legislation Rev., vol. ii, No. 2, June, 1912), states 
that there are thus three main causes of occupational eye strain: (1) 
asthenopia from fatigue incident to watching polished surfaces ; (2) 
fatigue of the ocular muscles from overaccommodation in constantly 
focusing upon nearby fine objects, such as is experienced by em- 
broiderers, stencilers and garment workers; (3) astigmatism and 
hyperopia, to which such workers are also very prone. Ciliary spasm 
also is common. 

The various forms of eye strain thus induced beget a number of 
reflex disturbances such as headache, giddiness, nausea, and finally 
contribute to neurasthenia. The eye strains are accentuated in turn 
by long hours of fatiguing work, poor food, ill-lighted workrooms 
and many other unhygienic conditions. Watching rapidly revolving 
grinding wheels or other rotating nearby objects is a common ad- 
ditional cause of occupational fatigue. Proof-reading is another, and 
I have lately seen a serious case in 'a music teacher who stood for 8 
hours a day behind her pupils, looking sidewise at the dots and bars 
of musical notation. Such illustrations might be multiplied in- 
definitely. 

In the United States Navy Surgeon-General Stokes reports that 
gunners who point the big guns in turrets through telescopes, who 
begin with normal vision, soon fall to eight or ten below. 

Treatment. Relief of eye strain is obtained to some extent 
by frequently resting the eyes by looking at distant objects, bathing 
them in cold water, securing better illumination for the work, and 
by any measures which improve the general health. 

TRAUMA AND THE DISEASES FOLLOWING IT 

There are very many trades in which the eyes are at first injured 
by trauma and then become infected by contamination with septic 
germs. Notable among these trades are all forms of emery grinding, 
sandblasting, coal mining, metal filing, stonecutting and work like 
that of ashmen, coal-heavers, railway engineers, cement grinders, 
etc., in which much dust is forcibly blown about. In the Report 
of the Subcommittee on Hygiene of the Eyes of the American Medi- 



564 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISOKDEES 

cal Association, published in the Journal of the Association, July 1, 
1911, it is stated: 

"Many of these accidents occur in chipping, fettling or dressing 
rough edges of castings, ingots and even large armor plates. These 
chippings are very brittle and sharp and fly about, often bounding 
from objects which they strike. They are caused by one or two 
strikers hitting a chisel held against the offending part by another 
man. Not only particles are likely to fly from the metal struck, 
but from either end of the chisel or from the hammers of the 
strikers. 

"Agriculturists often meet with eye accidents in threshing, chaff 
cutting, hedging, in distributing artificial fertilizers and by the en- 
trance into the eye of spears of grains and grasses, twigs and leaves, 
also from insects and their stings. These injuries are usually pro- 
duced by vegetable substances, straw, beards of wheat, etc., and are 
likely to become infected. 

"Special forms of affection result in taking care of some plants, 
as ophthalmia among hop pickers, due to entrance of fine, thin, 
hair-like processes from the hop leaves." 

Popping corks or the bursting of bottles being charged with 
gaseous fluids may bruise or lacerate the eyes and render them sub- 
ject to infections, or subsequent corneal ulceration and opacity. In 
the Westphalian steel and iron industry, in 1905, nearly 8 per cent, 
of the laborers had injuries of the eye, principally traumatic, and 
in some smelting works the percentage was as high as 10 (Ropke). 
Some of the workmen exposed to the intense light from the furnaces 
and molten metal acquired opacity of the lens. The injured victim 
usually appeals to a fellow workman for relief, who attempts to rub 
out the sharp, often deeply imbedded, particles of dust with a corner 
of a dirty rag or a toothpick, etc., with the almost inevitable result 
of serious infection of the cornea or conjunctiva. F. W. Miller 
asserts that such traumatism is increasing with the extension of 
rapid transit, the number of new mechanical appliances and of 
industries giving rise to irritant dusts and fumes. Strong acids or 
alkaloids, lime, etc., when spattered into the eyes, give rise to ulcer- 
ation with subsequent cicatrization and opacities of the cornea and 



THE EYES 565 

lens, which materially impair vision if they do not destroy it com- 
pletely. 

Through the infected wounds may follow iritis, ophthalmia, dis- 
tortion of the pupil by adhesions, and other lesions which may result 
in partial or total blindness. So great is the danger from meddle- 
some attempts by workmen to remove foreign bodies from the eye 
that in some of the large steel plants and others, where the danger 
from flying particles of sharp dust is constant, the workmen are 
forbidden to render such aid, and the victim must go to a dispensary 
maintained by the company, where a skilled nurse is trained to 
render proper aid. The foreign bodies themselves may be sterilized 
by heat in foundries and machine shops, and the menace of infec- 
tion usually lies in dirt subsequently introduced. 

Prevention. Prevention consists in warning workmen against 
the risk, posting of warning placards, the use of glass or mica shields 
and helmets (as in sandblasting) (Fig. 66, page 399), the use of 
protective goggles, the screening of grinding wheels and exposing 
as little of their surface as possible, and the placing of fixed glass 
shields on rapidly revolving machinery where they will screen the 
eyes of grinders (Fig. 11, page 93), the regulation of exhaust 
drafts to remove dust, and prevention of drafts from blowing toward 
the workman's face (Fig. 63, page 393). In chiseling or clipping 
iron or stone a canvas screen, appropriately placed, will often pre- 
vent rebound of sharp particles into the workman's eyes. 

Treatment. Sometimes skilled workmen are supplied with a flat 
platinum loop by which they may remove foreign bodies from the 
eye, after sterilizing it in a flame, but it is better not to permit 
them to meddle with them. Before removing the foreign body the 
eye should be well washed with a weak antiseptic solution or a satu- 
rated boric acid solution in sterile water, applied with an eye cup. 
Steel or iron particles may be removed with an electro-magnet when 
imbedded in the cornea, but magnesium, nickel, copper and brass 
dust will usually have to be removed by a scoop or snare under 
cocain anesthesia. Subsequently cold compresses should be applied 
and the eye should be rested by a pad or shield. Atropin may be 
required to quiet the ciliary muscle, and dionin may be used for 



566 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

pain. If iritis is present mydriatics and saline catharsis are indi- 
cated. The prognosis depends more upon the promptness of re- 
moval than the size of the foreign body, although much depends 
upon the depth to which it has penetrated and the possibility of 
infection. 



TOXIC GASES, VAPORS AND FUMES IN THE EYE 

These substances are met with in very many industries, both as 
a constant menace to the eyes and casually. They are encountered 
notably in chemical acid and alkali manufacturing plants, "gassing" 
in textile industries, bleaching and dyeing, singeing in print works, 
in sulphur works, smelting works, etc. Some of them act only 
locally upon the eyes, like fumes of acids and alkalies, others, like 
wood alcohol (See page 337), act upon the eye indirectly so to speak, 
i. e., their effect follows absorption and general toxemia and is 
exerted upon the retina, optic nerve, etc., and not upon the outer 
structures of the eye. Others, like lead, may act in both ways, 
according to the mode of entrance into the body. Thus fumes of 
molten lead may irritate the eye locally, causing conjunctivitis, or 
some time after absorption may cause total blindness through neuro- 
retinitis. Again they may cause temporary immediate effect through 
the circulation, producing double vision. 

A large variety of poisons of this order give rise to transient 
affections of the eyesight, and some of them to permanent effects. 
These affections include: amblyopia, diplopia, retrobulbar neuritis, 
paralyses of -the ocular muscles, neuroretinitis, iritis, conjunc- 
tivitis, corneal opacities, etc. The various poisons may give rise 
to any one or more of these conditions, depending upon the strength 
of the poison and duration of the exposure. Especially hazardous 
are the fumes of dinitrobenzol, which is much used in the manufac- 
ture of high explosives. 

Other substances which formerly produced much eye trouble 
have been eliminated from modern processes of manufacture or the 
operatives are better protected by the wearing of respirators and 
/lasses, as well as by the presence of exhaust fans. Such substances 



THE EYES 567 

are iodoform, volatile coal tar products used in dyeing, arsenic, 
formerly used in cosmetics and in the coloring of wall papers, arti- 
ficial flowers, and paints; carbon-bisulphid, formerly employed in 
vulcanizing rubber. 

Naphtha, if allowed to evaporate from uncovered containers, is 
very damaging to the eyes if inhaled in ill-ventilated rooms. It is 
used in clothes-cleaning and as a solvent for shoe cement and rubber, 
and in the manufacture of japanned or patent leather. 

Treatment. The eyes should at once be washed out with luke- 
warm sterile water, and in many cases it is desirable to put in a few 
drops of liquid vaselin, or olive or castor oil, which should be kept 
at hand in workshops where such risks are liable to be encountered. 
If iritis or conjunctivitis follow, atropin may be used to quiet the 
ciliary muscle and dionin may be used for mitigation of pain. The 
eyes should be rested and protected from light, if necessary, by 
bandaging. 

IRRITANT FLUIDS IN THE EYE 

In many industries the workman is obliged to lean over tanks, 
kettles or other receptacles containing irritant fluids, to stir them or 
dip various articles into them, and the fluids may easily be spattered 
into eyes unprotected by goggles. Serious burns occur from molten 
lead, solder, etc. 

Burns of the eye from ammonia should be treated with copious 
lukewarm sterile water irrigation, and, when unslaked lime has been 
blown into the eye in order to prevent the tears from moistening it, 
liquid vaselin or olive or castor oil should be dropped into the eye, 
and a local anesthetic, such as a 2 per cent cocain salve, should be 
used to relieve the pain. If the lime is already slaked and in solution, 
it is best to wash out the eye first with cold water and then with a 
3 to 10 per cent, ammonium chlorid solution, which acts as a solvent 
for calcium, as recommended by Wiirdemann. H. Guillery recom- 
mends the treatment of subsequent opacities of the cornea with a 
mixture of 10 per cent, chlorate of ammonium in water with 0.1 
per cent, tartaric acid. A warm 1 to 1,000 formalin aqueous solu- 
tion may be employed as a disinfectant. 



568 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

Acid solutions in the eye should be treated by weak alkalies, 
and alkalies with weak acid solutions, which should be kept near at 
hand where such misfortunes are liable to occur, as in acid factories, 
pottery glazing, and electroplating works. For acid burns of the 
eye H. Guillery (Archiv fur Augenheilkunde, Ixv, 139) recommends 
dropping into the eye a 0.5 per cent, solution of potassium hydrate. 

IRRITANT DUSTS IN THE EYES 

In general all dusts are irritant to the conjunctiva and sclera. 
Their effects may be purely mechanical or they may give rise to 
slight abrasions which become infected through germs borne into 
the eye with unclean dust particles. The force with which dust is 
blown into the eye, as well as its quantity, is an important factor in 
the effects produced. Cinders, ashes, sand, plaster, cement, coal and 
asphalt are familiar examples of inorganic dusts which thus irritate 
the eyes, and the various organic dusts from furs, skins, feathers, 
rags, leather, tobacco and many textile industries, especially those 
of jute, flax, cotton and wool, are all frequent agents in producing 
both acute and chronic conjunctivitis. The organic dusts are more 
liable than the inorganic to convey septic germs and hence give rise 
to purulent types of conjunctivitis. Hop-pickers may acquire acute 
conjunctivitis (E. M. Alger). 

Dust in the eyes causes immediate pain, photophobia, redness 
and sometimes swelling of the lids. There may be congestion of 
the corneal and retinal vessels. The tears are increased, and, if there 
be infection, tenacious pus tends to glue the lids together. 

Chronic conjunctivitis follows persistent irritation by dust. The 
eyelids are red and congested, the corneal vessels are congested, 
and there may be granulations of the lids which give rise to 
much discomfort and pain, or a feeling as if the eyes were 
"sanded." 

Treatment. Treatment of acute cases consists in washing the 
eyes frequently, at first every two hours, with solutions of boric 
acid (saturated) or boric acid with camphor water, and the frequent 
application of cold compresses. 



THE EYES 569 



DISEASES OF THE EYES DUE TO CIRCULATION IN THE 
BLOOD OF TOXIC MATERIALS 

In some cases the effect is transient and immediate, causing 
double vision and vertigo, acting mainly through the cerebral visual 
centers. In other cases the effect accompanies symptoms of general 
systemic poisoning, and is of the nature of chronic inflammation of 
the retina and optic nerve, causing partial or complete blindness. 

Some of the toxic metals afford striking examples of these symp- 
toms. Thus double vision is commonly associated with "brass 
chills" among those working in brass foundries, brass polishing, etc. 
Bisulphid of carbon, nitrobenzol and anilin dyes may cause serious 
eye symptoms (E. M. Alger). 

Lead causes serious central, as well as peripheral, eye diseases, 
such as retrobulbar neuritis and paralyses. It may be inhaled in 
fumes, or irritate the eyes directly, or enter the system through the 
mouth. Lead poisoning, which may be acquired in very many 
different trades, is particularly liable to injure the eyes of painters, 
file cutters, plumbers, electrotypers, typesetters and cleaners, pot- 
tery glazers and polishers, storage-battery makers, paint grinders, 
and makers of red, white, orange and yellow lead, makers of lead 
pipe, tinsmiths (solderers) and cutters of sheet lead or various lead 
articles of manufacture. 

Many volatile substances when they reach the blood through ab- 
sorption may seriously affect vision acting either directly upon the 
structures of the eye or affecting it through cerebral anemia. Of this 
group of volatile poisons wood alcohol forms the most striking exam- 
ple, as it produces almost instantaneous and frequently permanent 
blindness when inhaled (See page 337). 

The effects of intense light upoji the eyes are described upon 
page 514. 

MINERS' NYSTAGMUS AND OTHER TYPES OF NYSTAGMUS 

This symptom of rapid oscillation of the eyeballs is due to 
picking at overhead coal which requires strain of the eye muscles, 



570 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

the eyes being constantly directed both upward and to one side. It 
is, therefore, limited to those who handle the pick exclusively. The 
symptom usually subsides in time after changing the form of work. 
It is at present a rare phenomenon, owing to two causes, first the 
increasing introduction of machine methods, and, secondly, the 
operation of the Gross Weight Law, whereby miners are paid for 
the gross tonnage of the coal mined, not on the basis of the size of 
the nuggets. When the latter system prevailed the miners sought 
to increase their earnings by carefully picking out large fragments 
of coal, which involved the ocular strain. In the Report of the 
Illinois State Commission on Occupational Diseases of January, 
1911, the statement is made that, of 500 miners examined, none pre- 
sented nystagmus, although two stated that they had formerly had 
it and recovered. In England, however, in 1908, 386 cases were 
reported. 

Browne and Mackenzie state that the contributing factors in pro- 
ducing this symptom are: inadequate light, errors of refraction, 
straining of the extrinsic eye muscles, and a neurotic temperament. 
Ninety per cent, of their patients had errors of refraction. The 
symptom is often attended by severe pains in the head and eyes 
and by quivering of the eyelids. The miners find some relief from 
the affection by walking with the eyes directed downward. No 
special treatment, excepting rest, is of any avail, and after a pro- 
longed period spontaneous recovery may take place, which may be 
partial if not always complete. 

Nystagmus as an occupational symptom is not alone confined to 
miners, and may develop in those who are compelled to give close 
visual attention to constantly moving objects. For example, Dr. 
Collis, of the British Factory Inspection Service, found that 28 per 
cent, of 516 female sewing machine operatives had slight grades of 
nystagmus from fatigue of the eye muscles in following the work 
through the machine. 

Exceptional cases have occurred among compositors who kept 
their copy above the eyes and threw the head backward to glance 
at it. 



THE EAKS 571 

IV. THE EARS 

EXTERNAL EAR 

Dusty occupations lead to choking of the external auditory canal 
by accumulations of dust and cerumen. The obstruction may cause 
temporary deafness. This is common among jute workers, in rope 
or cordage industries, the fine jute fibers being particularly liable 
to pack the canal. It is also met with in those who handle much 
flour (bakers), cotton or wool millers, coal heavers, cement workers, 
and others. The inspissated cerumen, becoming hard, may give rise 
to eczema. Various dusty and volatile irritants, such as zinc, ar- 
senic, turpentine, chrome pigments, etc., may cause eczema, some- 
times of pustular type, of the external ear. These minor hazards are 
easily avoided by cleanliness or inserting plugs of cotton in the ears. 

TYMPANUM 

The tympanum may be ruptured by explosions of gunpowder, 
dynamite or gas, or deafness, usually of temporary nature, may 
result from such explosion without rupture of the tympanum. 
Hence those most liable to suffer from this injury are gunners, 
miners, quarrymen, and those who test high explosives, such as 
dynamite and allied products. 

The tympanum may also be ruptured in divers, caisson men 
or tunnel workers under compressed air. This is not likely to 
occur below 45 Ibs. of air pressure, and then rarely, usually as a 
result of too rapid increase of air compression, favored by catarrhal 
obstruction of the internal auditory meatus. It may occasionally 
occur also from very rapid decompression from high pressure. 
Hyperemia and hemorrhage may take place in the membrana tym- 
pani. This has occurred both in caisson men and divers, and in 
balloonists making rapid ascents into rarefied air. 

Professional pugilists may acquire rupture of the tympanum 
from blows over the ear. 



572 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



MIDDLE EAR 

Affections of the middle ear are very common among those whose 
occupations lead them to acquire naso-pharyngeal catarrh from in- 
haling irritant dust and fumes or from exposure to constant ex- 
cessive heat and moisture. Catarrhal or suppurative otitis media 
may in this manner be truly of occupational origin. It also may 
occur in those whose outdoor occupations lead them to endure long 
hours of fatigue, with exposure to cold and wet, as miners, drivers, 
sailors, postmen et al. Hemorrhage and air emboli may occur in 
the middle ear in caisson disease. 

INTERNAL EAR 

Labyrinthine disease, in so far as it is occupational, is mainly 
"due to excessive noise. It may be temporary or chronic and may 
result 'in permanent deafness. Vertigo is a common symptom of it, 
with sometimes nausea and vomiting, with f aintness. This group 
of symptoms may occur in compressed air illness from air emboli 
or hemorrhage into the scala or semicircular canals. In such cases 
deafness is bilateral and usually complete. It may lead to chronic 
inflammation of low grade, with atrophic change in the organ of 
Corti. 

According to Ropke's special studies among iron workers, such 
as smelters, foundrymen et al., the combination of exposure to fre- 
quent excessive temperature changes which induce nasopharyngeal 
catarrh, with irritation of the external auditory meatus by accumu- 
lated dust and dirt, may cause chronic catarrhal otitis media with 
labyrinthine inflammation and vertigo. 

The effect of noise upon the delicate internal ear presents an 
interesting study. It has been found that the volume of sound, i. e., 
the loudness of the noise, has less influence than the quality in caus- 
ing deafness. A reverberating noise, long continued in a confined 
space like the inside of a boiler which is being riveted, is par- 
ticularly harmful, but damage also occurs to the labyrinth from 



THE EARS 573 

explosions, as when firing big guns, especially in the turrets of war- 
ships, testing high-grade explosives, mine explosions, etc. The deaf- 
ness produced by constant noise of high pitch, but not necessarily 
extremely loud type, is common among loom-tenders, spinners and 
railway engineers, and may occur in telegraphers. A large pro- 
portion of railway engineers, fully 45 per cent., if they have been 
employed on engines for a number of years, have more or less laby- 
rinthine deafness. This is especially true of those employed on 
oil-fed locomotives, which are more noisy than those which burn 
coal, on account of the roar of the boiler fires. To this must be 
added the noise of whistles, air-brakes, and the general pounding of 
the train on the rails. Frequently, immediately after leaving the 
engine after a long run, the hearing is more defective than after 
rest. 

In many cases of occupational deafness the patient is annoyed, 
even when at rest, by buzzing or ringing auditory sensations. Occu- 
pational labyrinthine deafness is more pronounced for high than 
low notes, so that the patient may be able to hear low-pitched voice 
sounds while he is, perhaps, completely deaf to the high pitch of a 
shrill whistle. 

The men who use automatic rivet hammers in the fastening of 
iron girders on bridges and buildings are subjected to as much noise 
as boiler makers, except that, not working in a confined space, there 
is less reverberation. "Boilermaker's deafness," as it is technically 
called, is usually of labyrinthine type, and in time the high-pitched 
notes damage the labyrinthine structures permanently. Experiments 
with animals have confirmed such changes as resulting from high 
rather than low-pitched noises. Unfortunately, there seems to be 
no remedy for this hazard, for not alone the ears, but the tem- 
poral and other cranial bones are set in acute vibration, and, if a 
man must work inside a boiler or gun turret, he has to accept the 
consequences. 

In iron and steel foundries noise of trip-hammers induces both 
acute and chronic deafness from the excessive vibrations which affect 
the internal ear. Gas explosions in the foundries may give rise to 
rupture of the tympanum. 



574 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

Among 75 smiths employed in manufacturing railroad equip- 
ment, Gottstein and Kayser found 30 with serious impairment of 
hearing. Barr found among 100 kettlesmiths that only about 9 per 
cent, had normal hearing, and, among 31 more, Habermann could 
discover none whose hearing was not impaired. Among 40 copper- 
smiths Holt found 36 with abnormalities of hearing. The deafness 
is bilateral, but the ear usually nearest the loud noises is found 
chiefly affected. Subjective noises are heard in about half the 
cases and vertigo is common. 

Most of the authors referred to locate the difficulty in the inter- 
nal ear. In an autopsy upon one of his patients Habermann found 
atrophy of the filaments of the auditory nerve. (Arch, fur Ohren- 
heilk, Bd. xxx, S. 1.) 

V. THE MOUTH 

The mouth and adjacent structures are affected more or less 
seriously in a variety of ways by the occupational poisons. The 
teeth may be diseased, the lips, gums and entire mucosa of the mouth 
may be inflamed or ulcerated, the salivary secretion may be altered, 
and the bones of the jaw necrosed. These changes are brought about 
through direct contact with poisonous substances, through their in- 
halation in the mouth, and to some extent after absorption in the 
circulation and by resecretion in the saliva. 

Among the poisons which most often and seriously injure the 
mouth and adjacent structures are mercury, phosphorus, lead, zinc, 
copper, chromium, arsenic, chlorin, and the fumes of the mineral 
acids. Sugar and meal dusts also contribute to caries of the teeth, 
particularly of the incisors. The diseases of the mouth tend to 
produce loss of appetite, decay and loss of the teeth interfere with 
thorough mastication, and altered saliva impairs digestion. Result- 
ing from these conditions is chronic dyspepsia, with malnutrition, 
which, in turn, favors further decay of the teeth. 

THE TEETH 

The teeth in certain occupations may be injured by contact with 
hard metals, so that the incisors lose their enamel, soften and are 



THE MOUTH 575 

ground down. This occurs in workmen who hold nails in the mouth 
to facilitate rapid work, as do shoemakers and those engaged in 
nailing lath or shingles. Glassblowers hold iron blowpipes and turn 
them in the mouth, so that they are liable to grind the teeth. The 
teeth are also affected with necrosis and resulting pyorrhea from 
many toxic substances, and with lead, mercury and phosphorus pois- 
oning they become necrotic and loosened. Chlorin and its products, 
as inhaled in lime and soda works, paper bleaching, etc., with the 
moisture of the mouth, form hydrochloric acid, which softens and 
loosens the teeth. (See Fig. 57, page 368.) 

Caries of the teeth has also been observed in garment workers 
who held in the mouth threads colored by chrome and lead salts 
and other poisonous dyes (Adler). 

In various dusty trades the mouth becomes affected by sharp, 
hard particles which grind off the enamel of the teeth and cause 
caries. Such substances are graphite, coarse meal dust (among 
millers), dust from grinding mother-of-pearl buttons, sandblasting, 
etc. The dust particles lodge between the teeth, irritate the gums 
and favor the development of acids which act upon the enamel. 
In sugar refineries the constant inhalation of sugar dust in the 
mouth gives rise to similar processes of decay of the teeth and 
irritation of the gums (Kunert). 

Actinomycosis, which is rarely acquired as an occupational in- 
fection, may produce caries of the teeth. 

Prevention. The hygiene of the teeth is of the greatest im- 
portance in the occupations especially mentioned above. They 
should be brushed daily after work hours and before eating with 
an antiseptic paste, and the mouth should be well rinsed with a soda 
or boric acid solution. Lead workers often use weak solutions of 
sulphuric acid, but they do more harm to the teeth than good. In 
exposure to thick dust and irritating fumes workmen should refrain 
from talking, and, as much as possible, breathe only through the 
nose. 

All carious teeth should be filled or removed. In the match- 
making industry this is of the utmost importance, and the workers 
should have frequent compulsory examination of their teeth. 



576 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



THE GUMS 

The gums are inflamed and swollen and acquire a tendency to 
recede from the teeth as a result of absorption of lead, copper and 
mercury. The gingivitis is often chronic and painful. They may 
become ulcerated and affected by abscesses. Lead, copper and ex- 
ceptionally other of the heavy metals may be deposited in the gums, 
close to the teeth, in the case of lead causing the typical "blue line," 
and in that of copper a greenish discoloration. In addition to the 
general sources of lead poisoning by inhalation and swallowing de- 
scribed upon page 235, there are several occupations in which lead 
is directly placed in the mouth. Thus shoemakers sometimes hold 
tin-covered nails in the mouth. Cigarrnakers sometimes roll tinfoil 
in the mouth in covering cigars. In these instances the tin alloy 
contains lead. Diamond cutters who imbed the stones in a leaden 
matrix often moisten it with the finger wet with saliva. The saliva 
is increased by mercurial poisoning and altered in composition. 

Treatment. Gingivitis and bleeding gums may be treated by 
painting occasionally with iodin or argyrol, and the same treatment 
may be applied to ulcers in the mouth. For the latter, also, astrin- 
gent mouth washes may be employed, such as an alum solution. 
Mercurial stomatitis should be treated as described on page 297. 



THE JAW BONES 

The bones, especially the lower jaw, but occasionally also the 
upper jaw, become necrosed as a result of phosphorus poisoning to 
a most serious extent, as described on page 352. In most cases the 
poison acts primarily through teeth which are already necrotic from 
any cause, and which afford the vapor of the poison direct access to 
the bones, but the phosphorus necrosis may also result from absorp- 
tion of the vapor by the blood and the ultimate formation of acid 
phosphorus salts which are readily soluble. (This topic is further 
discussed on page 353.) 

Chronic mercurial poisoning may also give rise to necrosis of 



THE NOSE AND THROAT 577 



the jaw, but of less serious character than that of phosphorus, and 
very limited necrotic areas may result from neglect of teeth which 
have become decayed from any toxic cause with pyorrhea. 

Mother-of-pearl dust may give rise to a peculiar osteomyelitis of 
the jaw. Gussenbauer analyzed this substance and found, besides 
chlorid of lime, an organic material in the membranes covering the 
shell called "conchiolin." His hypothesis is that this substance has 
a specific action in causing the disease of the bone. Fortunately it 
is a rare condition. 

VI. THE NOSE AND THROAT 

The nose and throat are subject to many forms of occupational 
poisons which act both chemically and mechanically. For the greater 
part of their effect is local and direct, but in some few instances 
it is part of a general toxic condition resulting from absorption in 
the blood of various poisons. Naturally the nose suffers more than 
the larynx from the irritation caused by inhalation of sharp par- 
ticles of dust, especially in grinding with emery stones, sandblast- 
ing, working with raw products of animal or vegetable origin, such 
as wool, hair, jute, hemp, etc. In fact all dusts are irritating and 
the matter is one of degree of irritation. Some of the animal and 
vegetable fibers used in textile manufactures, in addition to their 
primary substances, convey irritating oil from machinery, etc. 
Acute attacks of sneezing, coryza and rhinitis are the usual result 
of such irritation, to which, however, the workmen usually soon 
become immune, although, if they quit work for a time, on return- 
ing to it they are liable to fresh attacks. If dusty occupations are 
persisted in, the rhinitis becomes chronic, and the hypertrophic form, 
with much secretion, often purulent, may be succeeded by the atrophic 
form, with uncomfortable dryness. In like manner, but in lesser 
degree, the pharynx and larynx may present acute and chronic in- 
flammation with hoarseness, cough and dry burning sensations with 
thirst. 

Certain chemical dusts, notably chrome pigments and chromic 
acid, and some hard dusts like that of mother-of-pearl and cement, 



578 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



cause ulceration of the nasal mucosa. The chrome ulcers, which 
often perforate the cartilaginous septum and attain considerable 
size and chronicity, are described on page 183. Similar perforating 
ulcers have been observed resulting from the irritation of mother-of- 
pearl (used in button grinding), cement, basic slag, and a number 
of other irritants. 

Epistaxis occurs in the ulcerative cases and in chronic rhinitis. 
It also results from inhalation of fumes of the nitrites, which 
cause vasodilatation. 

The chronic nasopharyngeal catarrh which results from ex- 
posure to cold and damp or suddenly alternating temperatures, as 
among dyers, paper makers, foundrymen, and in a host of other 
occupations, is very liable to cause catarrh of the middle ear. 

The larynx is especially liable to irritation and inflammation 
from the inhalation of strong ammonia fumes, chlorin gas, and the 
fumes of mineral acids. Edema glottidis sometimes occurs in such 
cases. 

Prevention.' Prevention of the different forms of nasal irrita- 
tion is to be provided by proper ventilation, the wetting of dusts, 
where possible, the wearing of respirators, and, in the case of dusts 
which may be chemically irritating, by the greasing of the interior 
of the nose with vaselin or simple cerate. 

Treatment. Treatment of the rhinitis consists in cleansing the 
nostrils by spraying or irrigation with warm normal salt solution or 
saturated boric acid solution. Excessive secretion may be controlled 
by the use of atropin (gr. 1/200) twice a day and astringent sprays 
of persulphate of iron. The healing of ulcers may be promoted by 
touching them with nitrate of silver solution or using an ointment 
of ichthyol or resorcin. 

Severe acute inflammation of the larynx may be relieved by 
steam inhalations, and a spray of iodoform in ether (gr. ii, fl. i)- 
An ice bag applied to the neck externally is useful, and, for edema 
of the glottis or vocal cords, nothing is so good as a 1 : 1,000 adrenalin 
chlor-id spray. Earely intubation may have to be resorted to tem- 
porarily. 



THE SKIN 579 

VH. THE SKIN 
GENERAL PATHOLOGY 

The skin is naturally protected to a great extent against external 
irritation and vulnerability, both by its structure and physiological 
function. Thus under some forms of irritation there is epithelial 
proliferation, with protective hardening; in others there is desqua- 
mation, with stimulation to greater circulatory or secretory activity. 
Variations in the local blood supply and absorptive power are fre- 
quent under chemical, thermic and other forms of irritation. In 
addition it should be noted that there is a wide range of personal 
idiosyncrasy in response to external, especially chemical, cutaneous 
irritants, so that the popular notion of "thick skinned" and "thin 
skinned" types of persons, although applied to mental traits, has 
also a more literal foundation in regard to structure or resisting 
power. The latter, moreover, while partly racial and partly heredi- 
tary or "constitutional," is also subject to considerable variation in 
the same person at different periods of life and under different con- 
ditions of health. 

Thus, as stated by Dr. John A. Fordyce : "The majority of irri- 
tants met with in the trades do not of themselves evoke an eruption, 
but rather act in conjunction with certain contributing factors. 
Those which come more prominently under consideration are a 
'special susceptibility,' a delicate skin, or one presenting some con- 
genital anomaly, as excessive dryness or ichthyosis ; impaired gastro- 
intestinal, hepatic, or renal function; a depressed state of health, 
neglected hygiene of the skin, or a lowered resistance by a pre- 
existent eruption." 

The latter factor of lowered resistance by previous irritation is 
highly important in the industrial diseases of the skin, for a man 
may handle a deleterious substance for a long time with immunity, 
but, once a skin lesion arises from it, it is liable to recur again and 
again. This is particularly true of the irritation caused by X-ray 
burns and certain dyestuffs. Moreover, repeated attacks of occu- 
pational skin lesions may result in chronic disease, very difficult to 



580 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

cure completely, for, vulnerability of the skin being permanently 
increased by one form of irritant, other substances may act upon 
it which ordinarily would be without effect. All this has practical 
bearing upon injury to many classes of workmen and temporary 
or permanent incapacity among them. 

Another important influence in favoring the production of occu- 
pational dermatoses exists in the prolonged maceration of the hands 
and arms when immersed in water, especially when cleansing soaps 
are used which remove the protective fat or oil of the surface. The 
macerated horny cells are also removed by friction in drying the 
skin. Under these conditions the skin is rendered much more vul- 
nerable to all forms of irritation. This is particularly noticeable 
in the hands of washerwomen, dishwashers and those of surgeons 
and dentists whose frequent ablutions are followed by the use of 
such antiseptics as lime, corrosive sublimate, carbolic acid, potassium 
permanganate, etc. 

Occupational dermatoses are very common, and John A. Fordyce 
states that they comprised two per cent, of the new cases treated in 
1911 at his clinic in the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical 
College. 

SPECIAL DERMATOSES: DERMATITIS AND ECZEMA; 
ECZEMATOID DERMATITIS 

Dermatitis of occupational origin may be local or general, and 
is a common accompaniment of other dermatoses, especially eczema. 
In both conditions excessive heat and exposure to continued moisture 
are often as much responsible for the irritation as any specific prop- 
erties in dust or dirt, as in the case of laundresses and sugar refiners. 

The dermatitis, which is most often of eczematoid type, varies 
from a simple erythema and desquamative condition of the skin 
(Fig. 101) to a vesicular and bullous state. With prolongation of 
the exciting causes of an eczematoid dermatitis, the catarrhal inflam- 
mation assumes a chronic state, the skin becomes infiltrated, thick- 
ened and hardened, and desquamation is accompanied by fissures 
which are sore and painful, often bleed and are liable to purulent 
infection. 



THE SKIN 581 

Many of the dermatitis or eczematous eruptions due to occupa- 
tion give rise to intolerable pruritus, and the scratching which fol- 
lows opens the fissures in chronic cases or makes new abrasions 
which are liable to infection and are made worse by continuance at

the original trade. Workmen often give their own names to such 
eruptions, such as "polisher's itch," "tar itch," "baker's itch," 
"cement itch," "grocer's itch," "sugar refiner's itch," etc. 

An acute form of dermatitis derived from the volatile essential 
oils of certain plants, of which there are said to be more than 60 
species, is known to affect the hands and face in florists. The most 
striking illustration is in a large variety of Dutch primrose. It is 
not necessary for contact with the plant to take place, as the emana- 
tion is so volatile that it will act at a distance of some inches. The 
eruption may be a simple erythema, or may closely resemble ery- 
sipelas, with vesicles, blebs and general subcutaneous edema. Only a 
few persons, however, are sensitive to this irritation. Other examples 



582 



SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



exist in the eucalyptus and certain varieties of chrysanthemum. The 
familiar poison ivy (rhus toxicodendron), poison sumac and poison 
oak have a similar property. There is a tree of the genus Rhus 
from which lacquer gum is .derived in India. Fordyce thus de- 
scribes the cutaneous irritation caused in some persons by contact 
with the lacquer or by inhaling fumes derived from it : "The symp-

toms appear in a few hours, and consist of fever and edema of the 
skin of the face, limbs and generative organs, nasal and conjunctival 
catarrh, and a papular eruption of the legs and forearms." 

Some of the woods having resinous dust, on being sawed, may 
cause a widespread dermatitis, with fever, vomiting and cutaneous 
symptoms lasting several weeks. 

Five cases of dermatitis among fur workers in New York City 
were reported in the early part of 1912 to the State Labor Bureau. 
Eczema also occurs in furriers. (Fig. 102.) 

As a result of the intense heat and light irritation of electric 



THE SKIN 583 

smelting the exposed skin of the face, neck and hands is affected by 
a burning sensation, redness, and sometimes blebs form. There is 
subsequent desquamation. 

Herxheimer enumerates 74 trades which may give rise to eczema- 
toid dermatitis. Bakers acquire dermatitis from the heat, moist 
dough, and saccharin materials to which they are exposed. Sugar 
refiners have a dermatitis of the hands, forearms and legs. They 
also acquire an infective lymphangitis, with boils, due, according 
to Gaillot, to infection of the scratched skin with the Staphylococcus 
pyogenes aureus, this common organism being found in molasses and 
the sugar cane residue. 

Redness and roughness of the skin of the face become a chronic 
condition in certain types of workmen, especially those working in 
nitrous gases, caustic soda or potash, sulphuric and hydrochloric 
acids, etc. It is also common in those exposed constantly to rough 
weather, as drivers, seafaring men, engineers et al. 

Eczema is by far the most common of the occupational cutaneous 
lesions, and naturally so, for these lesions are due mainly to ex- 
ternal irritation and not to internal toxic action, and the hands are 
exposed so constantly to all forms of dirt, dust, oils and chemicals. 

Among those most often developing this lesion on the hands or 
elsewhere on portions of the body exposed to the irritation are: 

Masons and others who handle cement and lime ; 

Stonecutters exposed to various dusts; 

Plasterers who handle lime, cement and sand; 

Brickmakers, who are exposed to brick dust and the dust of 
glazed tiles which may contain lead they may have a palmar der- 
matitis ; 

Bakers, who are exposed to heat and the dust of flour ; 

Bottle washers and barkeepers ; 

Sugar refiners, molasses stirrers and candy makers the molasses 
residue contains much irritant dirt; 

Cooks, who from constant exposure to heat are very prone to 
chronic eczema (Fig. 103) ; 

Coal heavers; 

Washerwomen especially when using alkaline or irritant soaps. 



584 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

The element of trauma is also a factor in this occupation from 
pressure on the rough washboard. John A. Fordyce states that 
about one-third of the occupational dermatosis cases presenting at

his clinic were in work people who had their hands much of the 
time in water and soap, and sometimes cleansing alkalies. He states 
that "the excessive use of soap and water by extracting the fat and 
macerating the horny layers reduces the resistance of the skin" ; 

Carders and spinners of jute, flax, cotton and wool, who are ex- 
posed to machine oil, fiber dust and dirt ;

kinds of exotic woods which contain irritant substances. At least 
one variety of wood contains a substance resembling chrysarobinic 
acid. Teakwood contains an essential oil which is not only specifi- 
cally irritant to the skin, causing a universal and very intractable

eczematoid dermatitis, but sometimes systemic symptoms such as 
vomiting and other digestive disorders ; 

Polishers and cleaners who, from using benzene, impure turpen- 
tine and resins dissolved in wood alcohol, often suffer from eczema 
with marked pruritus (Fig. 104) ; 

Surgeons and nurses, who may acquire chronic eczema of painful 
fissured type from the constant use for disinfection of the hands of 
such antiseptics as mercuric bichlorid, chlorid of linje, and carbolic 
acid; 



586 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

Workers who, with arsenical and chrome pigments, may acquire 
eczema and other more serious dermatoses ; 

Dyers and users of anilin colors, especially the red, orange and 
black colors, who may acquire eczematoid dermatitis, as may those 
with sensitive skins who wear underclothing thus dyed. The erup- 
tion in exceptional cases becomes pustular; 

The black, red and orange yellow pigments, according to For- 
dyce, are the most irritating; 

Calico printers, who from the use of caustics and bleaching ma- 
terials may have eczema and fissures of the hands ; 

Iron workers, who sometimes suffer from affections of the skin. 
Eczema of the hands, forearms and ears may be developed through 
exposure to great heat in smelting, combined with the irritation of 
dust. The dust of coke used in the process, mingled with sweat, 
chokes the orifices of the cutaneous glands, and small particles of 
steel or iron may lacerate the begrimed skin, which, on becoming 
superficially infected, presents f urunculosis ; 

Metal workers, machinists, and printers, who acquire eczema 
and ulceration from the irritation of metal dust, machine 
oil and such substances as acids, benzene and turpentine which they 
use; 

Electroplaters, who acquire eczema from lime dust, olive oil, and 
the acid beer used in "scratch brushing" ; 

Miners and smelters, who, working in the production of mercury, 
may acquire a pustular eczema; 

Chemists, who acquire eczema from a great variety of substances 
which they handle. Their hands may become hypersensitive, so 
that, as pointed out by Fordyce, inhalation of fumes, as, for ex- 
ample, of formalin, may call forth a fresh eruption without neces- 
sarily touching the substance. They develop anaphylaxis. Embalm- 
ers may acquire pustular dermatoses from formalin. 

Workers in tar, creosote, and a variety of petroleum products, 
like paraffin, naphtha, benzene and gasolene, may develop eczema. 

The handling of cinchona bark in the extraction of quinin, and 
the contact of vapor from the boiling solutions, may affect the hands

THE SKIN 587 

gists may suffer from the same trouble acquired in handling large 
quantities of quinin. 

A case of eczema of the hands is reported in Sozial Techmk, 
1912, vol. 4, No. 2, occurring in an Austrian modiste who dressed 
straw hats bleached with sulphur. 

Another case, similarly reported, of eczema of the eyelids de- 
veloped in a man employed in making cork-stone. The cork, mixed 
with pitch, is submitted to high temperature and pressure and much 
fine dust is liberated in the process. 

ULCERS 

Ulcers of the skin and nasal and buccal or pharyngeal mucosa 
are produced by a variety of agents. 

Typical among these are chromic acid and the chrome pigments. 
Details of this ulcerative process, which causes "chrome holes" in 
the nasal septum and "chrome sores" of the hands, are described 
under Chromium, on page 185. 

Hydrofluoric acid, used in glass manufacture and bleaching cane 
and making of fertilizers, gives rise also to nasal and buccal ulcers, 
and forms bullse and ulcers of the skin. 

Arsenic, as well as its compounds, which are much used as pig- 
ments, may cause serious ulceration, known as "arsenic pock," and 
superficial gangrene of the skin of the face, arms and hands. If 
transferred to the genitalia during micturition, the same lesions may 
develop there upon the sensitive skin. Arsenic causes eczema and 
ulceration in tanners and furriers, in both which trades it is used 
as a preservative. In the curing of furs it is mixed, as a sulphid, 
with lime, which makes it doubly irritant. 

The oils used for lubricating machinery are often irritant, partly, 
no doubt, from the dust and dirt which they entangle and from the 
difficulty of thoroughly cleansing the hands from them. Thus spin- 
ners, carders and weavers of jute, hemp, flax, cotton and wool, in 
addition to the eczema above mentioned, may sometimes acquire 
ulcers of the hands. Belgian flax spinners are subject to ulcers of 
the palmar surfaces of the hands, with deep fissures. Follicular erup- 
tions also occur on the face and arms in this industry. 



588 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDEES 

Ulceration of the skin is reported from the use of acid solutions 
in tinning processes, the use of milk of lime in cleansing metal for 
galvanization, and from mixing acetic a'cid and sodium bicarbonate 
in making lemonade pastilles. (Sozial Technik, 1912, vol. iv, 
No. 2.) 

Hatmakers acquire eczema and ulcers from use of sulphuric acid, 
and photographers from pyrogallic acid and mercury. 

Miners and smelters using mercury may develop a pustular 
eczema of the hands and arms, with ulcers. 

PEMPHIGUS 

J. T. Brown reported a case of pemphigus in a butcher during 
an epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease, and suggests a relationship 
possibly existing between the two diseases. 

SWEAT GLAND ERUPTIONS 

Sweat gland eruptions, inflammatory, vesicular, cystic, etc., are 
observed in a number of trades involving constant exposure to heat, 
as shown in stokers, cooks, foundrymen and others. Fordyce says 
that palmar hyperidrosis is common in aniline workers, who use 
chlorid of lime to remove the staining from the hands. This is also 
observed in the lime and soda industries and among tar and paraffin 
workers. The two latter classes of workmen acquire hyperkeratosis, 
and the abundant secretion of the sebaceous glands results in forma- 
tion of large dry crusts, matted with tar or paraffin. The dirt is 
conveyed by the hands or enters through the soiled clothing to the 
scrotum. 

Intertrigo is common in stout working people who sweat pro- 
fusely and work in hot, dusty atmospheres. Dust and grime collect 
in the folds of the skin, and inflammation, with swollen, macerated 
epithelium and sometimes superficial erosions, ensues. The skin 
should be washed with a saturated boric acid solution and treated 
with salicylic acid ointment, gr. x to the ounce of lanolin or cold 
cream. 



THE SKIN 589 

Hydrocystoma is a cystic occlusion of the sweat glands occurring 
sometimes in the center of the face in those who, like laundresses, 
lean constantly over a warm, humid atmosphere, as that over a 
washtub. 

IMPETIGO 

Impetigo occurs in various forms, especially that of scahies. 
Among those subject to it are candy and sugar makers. 

ACNE 

Acne occurs particularly in workmen in industries involving 
inhalation of chlorin, as in chlorate of lime works. 

Acne rosacea occurs in cooks and cabmen, but is probably alco- 
holic in origin rather than distinctly occupational. 

CHLORACNE 

Chlorin gas and the chlorids of calcium, sodium and potassium, 
when made by electrolysis, may give rise to an eruption of the face, 
chest and back resembling erysipelas, and caused by evolution of 
hypochlorites. The erythema and edema are followed by an eruption 
known as "chloracne," due to suppuration of the follicular glands. 
Fordyce reports that "with inflammation and suppuration of the 
follicular glands, nodules, pustules, boils and disfiguring scars are a 
not uncommon sequel." The pustular eruption may extend over 
the chest and back, leaving extensive cicatrices. (Fig. 105.) 

FURUNCULOSIS 

Furunculosis may occur by itself or accompany other lesions. 
It is liable to appear on various parts of the body and the infection 
may be transferred by the hands to the genitalia in performing 
micturition. 

Rene Martial ("L'ouvrier, son hygiene," etc.) cautions workmen 
particularly in regard to the care of the nails, for torn nails or 



590 



SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



"hang-nails" are a frequent port of entry for infection. Such lesions 
should be treated with a 10 per cent, bismuth salicylate solution or 
a one per cent, solution of glycerole of tannin, and further protected 
by collodion, and, when possible, by a rubber cot. 

Localized pustules and 
carbuncles often develop 
in those handling hides, 
hair and other animal in- 
dustrial products. Such 
lesions should promptly be 
excised. Hag sorters are 
prone to similar infec- 
tions, as are butchers, 
slaughter house workers, 
workers in bone-fertilizing 
plants, etc. They may also 
have impetigo contagiosa 
and cellulitis. 

Rene Martial ("Hy- 
giene individuelle d u 
travailleur") cautions such 
workmen especially 
against picking the teeth 
or scratching the auditory 
canals with penknives, 
pins or other sharp instru- 
ments which are liable to 
cause abrasions and thus afford a site for infection.

ERYSIPELOID 

f 

Erysipeloid occurs through infection of the skin in those 
handling animal products, such as butchers, fish and cheese mongers, 
poultry dealers and cooks. Gilchrist reported 323 cases due to crab 
bites in fishermen. Of this disease Fordyce says, "It is believed 
by Rosenbach to be due to a micro-organism of the order Cladothrix. 



THE SKIN 



591 



It is characterized by one or more areas of slowly spreading inflam- 
. mation, clearing up at the part originally affected and progressing 
slowly to new areas, the advancing border being festooned or scal- 
loped. Burning, pricking or itching sensations accompany the affec- 
tion, which involves chiefly the fingers and hands." 



CHILBLAINS 

Chilblains occur in those whose feet are constantly exposed to 
cold and dampness. 

CALLOSITIES 

Callosities and pa- ' 
pillomata of the fin- 
gers and palms of the 
hands sometimes be- 
come very painful and 
annoying (Fig. 106). 
They are caused by re- 
peated or continued 
pressure from hand- 
ling many kinds of 
tools, and have been 
observed in flax spin- 
ners who stretch and 
pull upon the fine 
threads. In miners 
the use of the pick de- 
velops such callosities 
on the ball of the 
thumb and outer sur- 
face of the hand. They FIG. 106. PAPILLOMA OF PALM OF THE HAND OF

tissues become in- 
flamed, suppuration may follow, which they call "the keens." 




592 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

Callosities of the fingers are extremely common, and, in fact, 
are unavoidable in very many occupations in which constant pres- 
sure is made over limited areas, as, for example, in the fingers of 
girls who plait straw, in calico printers using stencils and brushes. 
Such callosities may appear from leaning against hard tables or 
hard benches, affecting the skin over bony prominences, such as the 
tuber ischii, etc. 

Compositors acquire callous growths of the forefinger and thumb 
from constantly handling sharp-edged type (L. Devoto and L. 
Carozzi). 

Warts or callosities may remain simple proliferations of the epi- 
dermis or form extensive granulomata and papillomata. 

EPITHELIOMA 

Epithelioma of the skin develops very slowly as a result of cer- 
tain long-continued occupations in which irritant substances such 
as soot, benzene, creosote, tar and paraffin are ground into it. 
It usually arises from callosities, warts or other chronic lesions 
which may have preexisted for years. Robert Abbe has recently 
shown that the occupational epitheliomata caused by X-ray burns 
may be removed successfully by radium. 

Oliver reports the case of a man who had worked many years in 
coal oil and tar, acquiring extensive warts, ulcers and cicatrices. 
His son, doing the same work, had to have the forearm amputated 
for a malignant growth resulting from similar lesions. Metastases 
of the lymph nodes of the axilla and neck finally proved fatal. 

In London, in the 17th and early part of the 18th century, when 
boys and small men were employed to clean out chimneys where 
soft coal had been burned, by climbing through them, the soot and 
dust was ground into the skin and epithelioma and chronic ulcers 
frequently resulted. Such occurrences are now fortunately very rare, 
and, owing to difference in method, have never prevailed in this 
country. Soot may lodge in the deep folds of the scrotal integument, 
so that scrotal epithelioma, as well as that of the thighs, hands and 
arms, was formerly recorded. 



THE SKIN 593 

Gardeners who make use of soot to keep off slugs from plants 
are said to have developed epithelioma of the hands, but authenti- 
cated instances of such disease are difficult to find. 

Workers in tar, coal oil, paraffin and other petroleum or coal tar 
products, however, are subject to an itching eruption of the hands 
which develops a keratosis and multiple warts. Hypersecretion of

the sweat glands results in extensive incrustation. The disease may 
be transferred in the act of micturition to the scrotum. Finally 
true epithelioma may appear through malignant change in the 
warts. 

Unna has reported cases in sailors of papillomatous growths upon 
the face, head and hands which finally acquired an epitheliomatous 
character. They are attributed to the actinic rays of the sun acting 
upon those whose occupation has been one entailing constant ex- 
posure. 



594 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDEES 



PARASITIC DISEASES 

Parasitic diseases of the skin are sometimes occupational in 
etiology. Farmers who deal with animals infected with actinomy- 
cosis or millers who deal with grain which harbors the ray fungus 
have exceptionally become infected through some lesion in the mouth, 
such as that of a decayed tooth, or, still more rarely, through the skin. 

Sporotrichosis infects stablemen and farmers rarely who have 
come in contact with horses or mules attacked by this mycotic fungus. 
Nodules develop beneath the skin which may ulcerate and produce 
sinuses. The disease invades the lymph channels and may be ex- 
tensively distributed. 

A grain mite, the Pediculoides ventricosus, which is found upon 
wheat straw, may infest farmers who thresh the straw, or millers 
who handle infected grain, producing fever resembling mild typhus 
and an urticarial rash and dermatitis which itch intolerably. It is 
rare in this country, but cases have been discovered by J. F. Scham- 
berg in persons who slept upon straw-infected mattresses. 

Anthrax is described upon page 452, and glanders upon page 458. 

LOCALIZED TUBERCULOSIS 

Localized tuberculosis, or verruca necrogenica, sometimes de- 
velops on the knuckles or forearms in butchers who have become 
inoculated through cuts received in handling tuberculous cattle. 
John A. Fordyce has described several such cases, two of which are 
shown in the accompanying illustrations (Figs. 107, 108). 

FORMALIN ONYCHIA 

This substance is used chiefly in disinfection, the preservation 
of organic compounds and making of coal tar dyes. It is used among 
other disinfection processes in curing horsehair for brushes. Among 
physicians who use formalin as a disinfectant, and museum "dieners" 
who use it for the preservation of anatomical and other specimens, 



THE SKIN 595 

it causes a peculiar irritation of the distal phalanges of the fingers, 
with brittleness and splitting of the nails. By Fisher and Galewsky 
the condition has been described as "formalin onychia." It begins 
with brown discoloration of the nails, which then become serrated

of Dr. John A. Fordyce.) 

and fissured. The neighboring integument becomes ulcerated. The 
affection is very painful, so much so as frequently to compel aban- 
donment of the work which produced it. 

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS LESIONS 

Prevention. Eczema of the hands may be avoided to some ex- 
tent in occupations such as those of dyers, masons, plasterers, etc., 
by protecting the hands with simple cerate, oil, vaselin, cold cream, 
etc. Cleanliness is naturally of first importance, but frequent wet- 
ting and imperfect drying of the skin should be avoided. 



596 

Treatment. The hands should be cleansed and wrapped in 
gauze moistened with calamin solution, liquor plumbi subacetatis 
dilutus, or a mild salve may be applied under a loose glove, com- 
posed of aluminum acetate solution, with lanolin or vaselin or a 
diluted zinc oxid ointment. 

When the eczema proves chronic or rebellious to early treatment 
tar ointment or a weak resorcin salve, ichthyol ointment (40 per 
cent, in lanolin), or ichthyol collodion (40 per cent) is useful. In 
still more intractable cases the hands should be bathed in tar and 
oil for half an hour, which is then rinsed off with green soap. Or 
chrysarobinic or pyrogallic acid ointments may be used. Aristol in 
powder or ointment is most useful in stimulating the healing of 
ulcers, and the old-time balsam of Peru is of service. Parasitic 
diseases may be treated with corrosive sublimate and carbolic acid 
lotions and sulphur ointment. Hyperidrosis of the soles of the feet 
or palms of the hands is often very annoying to workmen who wet 
the feet or hands constantly in solutions that denude the epithelium 
and overstimulate the sweat glands. The feet may be dressed with 
the following ointment:

VIII. THE BONES AND JOINTS 

ABNORMAL POSITIONS OF THE BODY 

Constrained positions long maintained at certain kinds of labor 
give rise to various ailments and deformities, particularly through 



THE BONES AND JOINTS 597 

anterior or unilateral compression of the thorax toward the abdo- 
men. This results in impairment of movement of the diaphragm, 
free expansion of the ribs and sometimes visceroptosis. Those chiefly 
affected in this manner are shoemakers, tailors and weavers who 
use old-fashioned hand methods of work, carpenters or woodworkers 
who lean over and press against workbenches, engravers, lithograph- 
ers, jewelers and watchmakers. 

A man came to my clinic who had been employed as a shoemaker 
for 54 years, stooping over his work in a greatly cramped position. 
His thorax was bent upon the abdomen, his shoulders were rounded, 
and there was marked eversion of the free borders of the ribs and 
xiphoid cartilage. In addition to the pronounced thoracic postural 
deformity he had emphysema of advanced grade. 

Curvature of the spine may thus be induced and become perma- 
nent. Dyspepsia, constipation and hemorrhoids become chronic 
complaints, and tuberculosis is quite common among such artisans 
whose indoor work and lack of varied exercise contribute to the 
hazard of their occupations. 

Elevation of one shoulder much above the other is a very com- 
mon deformity resulting either from carrying heavy weights, such 
as porters of various types are accustomed to carry, or from the 
long-continued use of heavy hammers, or pulling or pushing upon 
certain machines. One of my patients, a young man 25 years of 
age, for some years had carried heavy timbers upon the right shoul- 
der, working as a carpenter's helper, with the result of acquiring 
permanent elevation of the right shoulder, lateral curvature of the 
spine in marked degree and compression of the left side of the 
thorax. I have met with a number of similar cases. 

The unequal development or hypertrophy of particular groups 
of muscles from the constant use of machines, apparatus or heavy 
tools necessitating lifting, pressure, etc., is a matter of such com- 
mon observation that a workman's occupation may often correctly 
be guessed from examination of his muscular or skeletal de- 
formities. 

Young children employed in carrying heavy baskets or trays, 
as in pottery works, very easily acquire lateral twists of the torso, 



598 

curvature of the spine, round shoulders, or compression of the 
sternum. 

Varicose veins are common among motormen, those who tend 
machines, and others whose work necessitates standing long hours 
in a confined space. 

Great muscular strain, besides inducing chronic deformities, may 
give rise to hernia and dilatation of the heart. Such conditions were 
formerly common among men like hod carriers and miners who 
had to climb long steep ladders in coming out of deep mines, but 
the almost universal use of lifts in connection with such work has 
greatly lessened these hazards. 

Treatment. Treatment of the various occupational deformities 
consists in correcting the attitude while at work, the training and 
exercise of opposing groups of muscles, and in children especially 
by the wearing of appropriate bandages or splints. Those whose 
occupation tends to produce round shoulders or a hollow chest 
should desist occasionally from work to practice deep breathing 
exercises and thoracic gymnastics. 

AFFECTIONS OF THE JOINTS 

Diseases of the joints are extremely common as a direct result of 
many industries. The greater number of ailments, by far, result 
from exposure to wet and cold, or to sudden alterations in tem- 
perature, with checking of perspiration, as are met with in laun- 
dresses, stokers, workers in potteries, blast furnaces, dyeing and 
paper making establishments, etc. Trauma is also a frequent cause 
of such ailments. 

Persistent kneeling upon hard surfaces, as done by scrubbing 
women and men who lay floor mosaics or scrape and plane hard- 
wood flooring, besides producing muscular cramps and sciatica, often 
leads to hypertrophy, with accumulation of fluid in the patella bursae, 
commonly known as "housemaid's knee." 

Automobile washers, who often work late at night in open, drafty 
garages exposed to wetting, are very subject to rheumatic pains, and 
many similar occupations could be cited which favor this condition. 






THE BONES AND JOINTS 599 

There is a subacute inflammation of joints described by the patient 
as "rheumatism," with moderate swelling due to synovitis, more or 
less pain and tenderness, and especially stiffness. 

Treatment. The condition is best relieVed by liniments, such 
as the linimentum saponis or capsici, the Scotch or alternating hot 
and cold douche, and the Paquelin cautery. If fluid be present, 
strapping the joint firmly with interlaced strips of adhesive plaster 
gives relief, or a bandage or knee cap may be fitted over the joint. 
The patient should be instructed to favor the joint as much as pos- 
sible in working. In obstinate cases a capsicum blister drawing 
several drachms of serum often gives great relief within 24 hours. 

Housemaid's knee requires substantially similar treatment with 
that above outlined, but a longer period of rest of the joint or change 
of work may be required to produce permanent relief. 

In still other cases the joint symptoms are due to some general 
toxic agent, such as lead or mercury. In these cases there often are 
accompanying neuritis and muscular atrophy. Treatment should 
not be too vigorous. A mild liniment or soothing ointment may be 
applied and the joint wrapped in cotton and bandaged. 

So many industrial workers come to my clinic with joint affec- 
tions of one or other of the above varieties that the following circular 
prepared by my chief of clinic, Dr. W. H. Sheldon, is given to 
them:

Instructions for Patients with Chronic Joint Disease 

Remember: Never consider your case hopeless. While the doctors maj 
not always cure, they can do much to prevent your complaint from spreading 
By following these instructions you can prevent the bad effects on the heart 
bloodvessels and kidneys. 

To avoid catching cold 

(1) Wear flannel underclothes all the year, warmer in winter. 

(2) Keep the feet dry; wear warm socks or stockings; change them often 
if your feet perspire. 



600 SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 

(3) Do not get wet or chilled. 

(4) Keep in the open air and sunshine. 

(5) Keep your rooms at an even temperature, not too hot. 

(6) Avoid basement and ground floor apartments, as they are inclined 
to be damp. 

Occupation 

Avoid all out-door occupations in which you will be exposed to wet or 
cold, such as cabmen, drivers, conductors or motor-men, sailors, etc. Indoor 
work, such as carpentering, operating machines, etc., is better for you. 
Diet. Eat slowly; chew the food well. 

Meat. Any red or white meat, boiled, broiled or roasted, once a day. 
Dairy Products. Milk, cream, butter. 
Cereals. Rice, hominy, Indian meal, barley, cracked wheat, oatmeal, cream 

of wheat, etc. 

'Bread. At least one day old. Whole wheat, rye, Graham, corn bread. 
Eggs. Cooked in any way except fried. 
Vegetables. Potatoes, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, 

peas. 

Fruit. All fresh fruits except strawberries. 
Avoid all canned, salted, or fried meats, pastries, pickles, and all fried 

foods. 
Drink plenty of water, at least two quarts daily. This carries away 

poisons from the kidneys. Drink no alcoholic liquors, including beer. 

They are poisonous for you and will shorten your life. 
Habits. Sleep at least. eight hours every night. 

Be sure to have at least one good movement of the bowels every morning. 

Keep the teeth clean. Have all cavities filled, as some joint conditions 
are caused by bad teeth. 

Practice deep breathing in the open air. 
Exercise. It is most necessary that you should take plenty of exercise, 

as this prevents your becoming crippled. Walk from two to four 

miles a day, and take light exercise with a cane or dumbbells, night and 

morning. 

Local Treatment 

Wrap towels, wrung out in hot water, about the joint for ten minutes 
night and morning. (The towels must be kept as hot as you can bear them). 
Then rub and knead the joint vigorously for ten minutes more. Try to 
move the joint a little more every day, as this prevents it getting stiff. 



Caution 

If a joint becomes red, swollen and painful, go to bed, and send for a 
doctor. Until he comes keep the part at rest wrapped in cotton, and take 



THE BONES AND JOINTS 601 

no food except a glass of milk and some crackers. If you do this you may 
prevent the serious results upon the heart, bloodvessels and kidneys, and 
prolong your life. Remember that serious heart troubles come from ne- 
glecting to do this. [This refers to rheumatic endocarditis.] 



FLAT-FOOT 

The flattening of the arches of the feet, or "flat-foot," occurs 
frequently in occupations which demand continuous standing on 
hard flooring, especially in one position, as in tending certain ma- 
chines. It is common among motormen who throw the body weight 
upon the left foot while sounding the gong of trolley cars with the 
right. It is met with in laundresses and is particularly common 
among hospital nurses, especially where the flooring is of tiles or 
hard wood. These women often are accustomed previously to wear- 
ing high-heeled, narrow-pointed shoes. To promote quiet in the 
wards, they are compelled to change the type of shoe, wearing low 
heels, or no heels and broad soles. I have tested the distance walked 
by nurses in my wards by having them wear pedometers, and found 
it to be from 5^ to 7 miles per diem. Besides this, they do 
much standing, stooping and lifting, working from 10 to 12 hours 
per diem. 

Mill hands who tend looms often remove their tight walking 
shoes and work in loose slippers, or sometimes bare feet, with the 
result of flattening the arches of the feet after a few weeks or 
months of work. The result is a constant aching in the soles of the 
feet, which extends up the calf of the leg, or sometimes causes pain 
in the knee and hip also on walking. The pain is constant while 
the limbs are in active use, and becomes so wearing as to interfere 
seriously with efficiency. 

Treatment. Treatment consists in adapting proper support to 
the plantar arches by orthopedic shoes, the use of massage night and 
morning with hot and cold douching of the feet, and by strapping 
the ankles and feet with adhesive plaster. In some cases cure can 
only be maintained through change of occupation. In tending ma- 
chines while standing in a fixed spot, a soft mat of some kind is of 
service in preventing foot strain.

SPECIAL OCCUPATIONAL DISORDERS 



IX. THE BLADDER 

Overdistention of the bladder as an occupational disorder is 
more common than is generally supposed and very little attention 
has been directed to it. It occurs most often among public carriers, 

such as engineers, drivers, chauf- 
feurs, and especially motormen 
and conductors of trolley cars, who 
have long trips to make without op- 
portunity to evacuate the bladder 
at the accustomed intervals. In 
time the bladder becomes more 
and more distended and its walls 
weakened, so that, in extreme 
cases, it cannot ever be completely 
evacuated and dribbling of urine 
results. The case presented in 
Figure 109 represents the extreme 
limit of this unfortunate condition.

was employed for several years in

by regular catheterization every six hours, the application of an ab-

Strychnin was also given. Under these measures he improved con- 
siderably, but was far from well when he left my hospital service. 
For some time previous he had been unfit to work.

INFLUENCE OF SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON THE 
OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

I. ALCOHOLISM 

The relationship of chronic alcoholism to occupational diseases 
is a very important matter, and it is desirable to determine in the 
first instance whether any of the occupations predispose to drinking 
hahits. 

Those constantly exposed to excessive heat, such as glass-blowers, 
stokers, smelters and rubber workers, perspire very freely and be- 
come consequently thirsty. If they drink the malted liquors pri- 
marily to quench thirst, they soon drink too much, and in these 
classes of workmen drinking is rarely confined to the milder intoxi- 
cants. Beer brewers, mainly from easy access to the product, and 
especially beer wagon drivers, consume enormous quantities of malt 
liquor, often received as a perquisite in the saloons where they deliver 
their casks. I have seen many such men with much dilated stom- 
achs, chronic nephritis and a tendency to obesity. 

It is not to be supposed that the occupational poisons them- 
selves develop any special craving for. alcoholic beverages. Alco- 
holism in such cases is due rather to general lowering of vitality, 
often combined with gloomy surroundings, where the victim works in 
dark, damp or overheated rooms, as in smelting, stoking, etc., is 
covered with grime, hfts long hours of work, and depressing home 
surroundings, where he soon loses self-respect. Gas houses, foun- 
dries, fertilizer works, chemical works, refineries, breweries, etc., 
produce conditions which make nearby property undesirable for 

604 



ALCOHOLISM 605 

residence, so that the workman's home and the saloon are often the 
only habitations within a long distance. Hence workers in such 
classes of industry are subjected to a dull, unvarying routine of life 
from which the saloon affords their only refuge. No doubt, also, 
the fatigue induced by heavy muscular effort in these grosser indus- 
tries meets with temporary abatement by drink, but the effects of 
alcohol for this purpose are very transient, whereas its toxic prop- 
erties are insidious and constant in their advance. 

In a word the relationship of alcoholism to industrial diseases 
is a question of environment, and often a social one rather than a 
physiological one. For such reasons alcoholism is very prevalent 
among certain classes of workmen in addition to those above men- 
tioned, such as painters, typesetters, bakers, ashmen, garbage men, 
etc. Hence any well-directed effort to ameliorate chronic alcoholism 
(for apparently it can rarely wholly be prevented) must deal with 
questions of wages, food supply and cooking, housing, wholesome 
diversions, cleanliness and personal hygiene, which are usually more 
potent than the influence of any particular trade apart from en- 
vironment. 

Chronic alcoholism is well known to lower the resisting power 
of the organism against microbic invasion, notably in such diseases 
as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Certain of the occupational dis- 
eases make much more rapid inroads upon the alcoholic constitution 
than upon the non-alcoholic. Very notable is this effect in lead 
poisoning. The typesetter or painter who keeps his system more or 
less under the influence of whiskey or gin most of the time is far 
more liable to serious plumbism by so doing, so that grave lesions 
of the nervous system are liable to supervene, such as paralysis, 
encephalopathy, etc. 

Chronic alcoholism, in conjunction with chronic metal poisoning 
of any sort, is especially liable to establish arteriosclerosis, chronic 
interstitial nephritis and cirrhosis. Hence in many cases it is diffi- 
cult to determine how much of the morbid conditions is due to the 
occupational poisoning and how much to alcohol. In this class of 
cases any acute illness, like pneumonia or rheumatism, is likely to 
be accompanied by an outbreak of delirium tremens. 



606 SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



II. SYPHILIS 

The trio of syphilis, alcoholism and chronic metal poisoning 
make a combination of diseases which often act as synergists to 
each other, so that the more serious lesions of each may develop, but 
particularly in this class of cases are found advanced arteriosclerosis 
at a comparatively early age (often with aneurysm), and sclerosis 
of the brain and cord, locomotor ataxia and other permanent de- 
structive lesions of the central nervous system. Cerebral hem- 
orrhage may also take place at an early age. Plumbism in a syphi- 
litic patient is apt to present symptoms of unusual gravity. As a 
matter, therefore, both of prognosis and treatment, the early recog- 
nition and vigorous treatment of syphilis are especially important in 
those whose work brings them into continual contact with the metal 
poisons. 

in. ABUSE OF FOODS 

There are several important dietetic matters to be considered in 
relation to occupation. 

The normal appetite is often destroyed by toxic conditions, espe- 
cially among those who deal with the toxic gases, vapors and fumes, 
and those who become anemic through chronic metal poisoning or 
from long hours of sedentary work in overcrowded, ill-ventilated 
rooms, such, especially, as are common in the textile and clothing 
industries. Often the hours of labor are such as to derange ordinary 
meal habits, as in night work, or rising so early on dark, cold winter 
mornings that little or no breakfast is eaten. Many foreign laborers, 
particularly Austrians and Hungarians, are accustomed before eom- 
ing to this country to take no food on rising except perhaps a cup of 
coffee, and to adjourn work at ten o'clock or thereabout for break- 
fast. If compelled by American custom to work continuously until 
noon, they have to work many hours with an empty stomach, whereas 
for the laboring man breakfast should be a substantial meal, eaten 
early. In certain industries employing foreigners it has been found 



ABUSE OF FOODS 607 

an economic advantage to adapt the work hours to meet such habits. 

Breakfast for the laboring man is often the most important meal 
of the day, for in some industries especially those dealing with lead, 
phosphorus and other active poisons a well-filled stomach is dis- 
tinctly preventive of poisoning. 

Another difficulty often met with is the brevity of the noon 
period for luncheon or dinner. If this meal be eaten hurriedly and 
hard muscular work performed directly after, digestion is retarded, 
dyspepsia, constipation and other disturbances result, all which 
tend to impair health and efficiency in marked degree. There may 
be no time or facilities for preparing hot food for either breakfast 
or luncheon, and, as a result, improper and often indigestible foods 
are eaten. The relationship of poor or unappetizing food and dys- 
pepsia to acquisition of the drink habit is too well established to 
require detailed comment here. 

The great importance of food cleanliness, particularly where con- 
tact with toxic metal dusts is possible, has repeatedly been pointed 
out in connection with the separate industries. Probably ninety 
per cent, of the cases of chronic lead poisoning might be traced to 
contact of dust of lead or its salts with food eaten in the workroom 
or without properly cleansing the hands. 

In almost all large manufacturing establishments where the ex- 
periment has been tried the provision of separate lunch rooms has 
proved an economic success in lessening the days of illness of the 
employees. Well-lighted, cheerful, cleanly surroundings certainly 
promote both appetite and digestion. Many well-regulated indus- 
tries like that of the American Telephone Company, go a step fur- 
ther in promoting hygiene of the employees by providing means for 
serving hot soups or coffee, etc., with the meals. Young girls par- 
ticularly, without such rational facilities for proper dieting, are 
liable to try to stimulate their anorexia by confectionery, pickles, 
and a variety of innutritions substances which only serve to main- 
tain chronic dyspepsia, anemia and malnutrition. 

In my Out-Patient Clinic in the Cornell University Medical Col- 
lege we meet with such constant illustrations of the facts above 
mentioned that Dr. W. H. Sheldon, my chief of clinic, has devised 



608 SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

a circular of printed dietetic instructions which have been found 
exceedingly useful and practical to instruct what may be termed 
occupational dyspeptics. These instructions are given under the 
headings Food and Drink, on page 127, and Constipation on 
page 157. 



IV. ABUSE OF NON-ALCOHOLIC STIMULANTS AND DRUGS 

There are several stimulants of the nervous system which are 
sometimes employed in deleterious excess, as a result of modern con- 
ditions, in order to keep awake under long-continued strain (as in 
the 24-hour shifts formerly in vogue in foundries, chemical refin- 
eries, etc.), or to counteract depression. Coffee and, to a greater 
extent, tea, when used in unreasonable quantities, beget dyspepsia, 
gastritis, insomnia, palpitation, muscular tremors, and, in the case 
of the tea habit, I have seen painful multiple neuritis, affecting the 
nerves and muscles of the extremities. 

The abuse of drugs is distinctly a disease habit of modern life, 
influenced by occupation in the same manner as the stimulant habits. 
The worst of all is the cocain habit, the most frequent the morphin 
or opium habit, and there are many other serious, though less com- 
mon, drug addictions, such as the excessive use of chloral, heroin, 
the bromids, etc. These poisons are all depressants of the nervous 
system and heart action when taken in excess, although in the case 
of cocain, heroin and morphin there may be a preliminary phase of 
undue mental and nervous excitement. The moral sense becomes 
perverted so that the victim who begins by lying about the quantity 
of the drug he takes soon lies about everything, become suspicious 
of his friends, and filled with apprehension and hallucinations. He 
becomes bodily weak and mentally incapacitated, until, unless he can 
be rescued, which is seldom, he requires restraint in a sanitarium. 
Not a few of these drug addictions are originally acquired through 
ignorance of their danger, the drug being taken to relieve the pain 
of a toxic occupational neuritis, insomnia due to excessive fatigue, the 
strain of overuse of muscles, or as the pernicious and utterly fal- 



ABUSE OF TOBACCO 609 

lacious "nerve tonics." Young girls employed in the textile and 
clothing industries supply not a few. of the victims. 



V. ABUSE OF TOBACCO 

Tobacco, used to excess in any form, gives rise to similar symp- 
toms to the excessive use of tea and coffee, but with more marked 
effect upon the heart, for nicotin is a cumulative poison that in time 
tends to make the heart action rapid, irregular and feeble. To- 
bacco may also give rise to a form of temporary blindness. 

Excessive smoking maintains constant pharyngitis and renders 
the nasal and bronchial mucosa vulnerable to catarrhal infections. 
Tobacco poisoning from excessive smoking is sbmewhat less common 
among the working classes than among the affluent, for the reasons, 
probably, that in many indoor occupations smoking is necessarily 
prohibited, and in outdoor occupations, accompanied by vigorous 
exercise, smoking is less harmful than in sedentary life in closed 
apartments. On the other hand, chewing is very prevalent among 
workmen, and I have met with many cases of tobacco poisoning 
from this habit. When chewed, more or less of the tobacco, besides 
being absorbed from the mouth, is swallowed with the saliva, and in 
time it develops gastritis, sometimes diarrhea, and always nervous 
symptoms, of which tachycardia and intermittent heart action are 
the most common, but there may be muscular tremors, insomnia and 
amblyopia. 

A special danger from the use of chewing tobacco exists among 
workers in the toxic metals who put the "quid" in the mouth with 
dirty fingers or keep the tobacco plug in a dirty pocket; thus they 
easily convey metal dust to the mouth. (See Lead Poisoning, page 
218.) 

Although tobacco in any form is unnecessary, it is nevertheless 
a great solace to many a workman whose pleasures are few, and, 
used in proper moderation, it neither shortens life nor impairs health, 
as is often claimed for it, provided it is not used in boyhood or early 
youth. 



610 SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Treatment. Treatment of the "tobacco heart" consists in stop- 
ping its use and giving belladonna and sodium bromid. The gas- 
tritis is usually promptly relieved by ceasing to chew tobacco, and 
by giving such simple gastric sedatives as bismuth, cerium oxalate 
and bicarbonate of soda. Temporarily workmen may sometimes be 
induced to chew gum, as less injurious, or to chew on a fresh piece 
of rubber tubing which gives the exercise of the jaw muscles that 
has become a difficult habit to abandon, and without anything being 
swallowed or absorbed. In this manner the chewing habit sometimes 
may be reduced. 



PAKT VII 

MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES GROUPED 

BY INDUSTRIES NOT INCLUDED IN THE 

FOREGOING CLASSIFICATION 

I. MINING 
THE MINING INDUSTRY IN GENERAL 

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1912 there 
were about 800,000 coal miners in this country, and as many more 
work in the various ore-producing mines. Many of these mines, 
especially those in Colorado, are operated at great depth 1,000 feet 
or more so that ventilation is a difficult problem. On account of 
the danger from "coal damp" or marsh gas, coal mines are usually 
artificially ventilated, but mineral mines are not, excepting as the 
compressed air introduced to operate mechanical drills supplies the 
deficiency. Such air should always be drawn from outdoors and 
not from the engine room, as it often is. 

Miners are subject to a variety of deleterious conditions which 
may be classed under: (A) those common to mining in general, 
and (B) those due to the specific substances mined. 

(A) Harmful Conditions Due to Mining in General. With 
increasing depth of the mine the temperature rises at the rate of 
approximately 1 F. per 100 feet of depth. With increasing depth, 
also, the difficulty of adequate ventilation rapidly augments, the air 
is apt to accumulate moisture and the heavier natural gases, such 
as carbonic acid and marsh gas. The former may originally be 
present in the mine or is produced by the respiration of the men 
and any draught animals which may be employed. In addition, it 

611 



612 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

is derived from combustion of the lights used and from ignition of 
explosives. 

The various gases of explosives, especially of nitroglycerin and 
dynamite, are irritating to the respiratory mucous membranes and 
may give rise to chronic nasal catarrh, and the nitrites may give 
rise to disturbance of the circulation. Most mines, particularly 
coal mines, contain much dust which is more or less irritating. 

The detonation of explosives reverberating through the confined 
air spaces of the galleries and chambers causes repeated concussion 
of the tympanum, which, in conjunction with nasopharyn'geal ca- 
tarrh, produces tinnitus, vertigo and varying degrees of deafness. 
In some cases dust particles forcibly driven by explosives cause 
erosions of the nasal mucosa. In some such cases Ropke, of Solin- 
gen, has observed an atrophic rhinitis and purulent catarrh of the 
nasal sinuses. 

After becoming overheated by working in damp, hot mines the 
workmen, on going out into the cold air in winter time, wearing 
perspiration-soaked clothing, sometimes suffer from bronchitis and 
rheumatism. 

The fire damp, carbonic acid or other gases which do not sup- 
port combustion extinguish the miner's candle and give prompt 
warning that the air is unfit to breathe; nevertheless, miners will 
often continue their work in such atmosphere, substituting carbid 
lamps, which are not so readily extinguished. The hazard from fire 
damp and carbon dioxid is greatest in coal mines, but fortunately 
these gases are heavy and accumulate near the ground. In mineral 
mines other gases, specifically poisonous, may also be present. Hotch- 
kiss reported the death of a miner in Colorado from inhalation of 
powder smoke, and collected reports of 18 similar fatal cases occur- 
ring within a decade, and in the construction of the Gunnison Tun- 
nel 9 out of 13 tunnel workers met death from the same cause. 

The dust of mines naturally varies with the nature of the ma- 
terial mined, and of the methods of drilling, blasting, etc. Varia- 
tions in the same mine are also dependent upon the degree of mois- 
ture present. Miners can rarely be induced to wear respirators or 
otherwise protect themselves from the risks of dust inhalation. 



MINING 613 

Where compressed air is used instead of a spray of water to cleanse 
the drill holes the dust hazard is great, especially when overhead 
drilling is employed, so that the dust is blown back into the face 
of the operator. (See Fig. 61, page 391.) 

Filth infections occur among miners in unhygienic mines from 
their defecations. Typhoid fever may exceptionally be spread in 
this manner, as well as dysentery and the so-called Cochin China 
diarrhea. But the most common of the soil pollution infections of 
miners is the hookworm disease, uncinariasis or ankylostomiasis, 
which is described on page 449. 

Miners often occupy temporary camps which are usually very 
unhygienic; the soil pollution diseases may originate in them, and 
the germs are conveyed into the mines by the feces of the workmen. 

(B) Conditions Due to the Specific Substances Mined. Con- 
ditions of this type which are deleterious concern mainly workers in 
lead, mercury, arsenic and sulphur. These hazards are described 
under the separate headings of these substances. 

COAL MINING 

Particles of coal dust, unlike metallic or mineral dusts, are not 
usually sharp-edged, but are nevertheless irritating and are inhaled 
and stored in the lungs, bronchial and mediastinal glands in great 
quantities. The special risk involved in long-continued inhalation of 
this dust is fibrosis of the lung, known as anthracosis. Coal miners 
are fairly healthy workmen, despite the large quantity of dust in- 
haled, and are found to be less susceptible to pulmonary diseases in 
general than many other classes of workmen, provided they do not 
drink heavily. In fact, in the coal miners of England and Wales, 
the mortality from these diseases is actually less by one-fifth than 
the general mortality among males 'of all other classes. The coal 
heavers, sifters and stokers are more exposed to inhalation of finely 
comminuted coal dust than are the pickmen in the mines, and hence 
far more cases of "miner's phthisis" are to be found among them. 
(See page 33.) 

A patient who came to my clinic had worked as a coal miner in 



614 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

dust and dampness for 19 years. For 11 years he had a chronic 
cough, with much expectoration and occasional attacks of rhinitis. 
When examined he had advanced pulmonary emphysema with an- 
thracosis, and, although he had not been able to work for several 
years owing to amputation of an arm, his sputum still contained 
particles of carbon. 

In mine blasting small particles of unconsumed nitroglycerin 
are sometimes blown into the coal along with detritus. According 
to Dr. O. V. Hoffman, of Dayton, during picking and shoveling 
some of this nitroglycerin may be inhaled, and a very small quantity 
will produce in the miner the symptoms of nausea, palpitation 
and headache. He has found men working on the tipple in the open 
suffering from the same symptoms when the loads are dumped. 

Coal miners frequently exhibit bluish discoloration of the skin 
of the nose and face, due to tattooing with particles of coal or 
powder which have become embedded. (See Fig. 74, page 417.) 

The substitution of water power for blasting powders in the 
mining industry is likely to mitigate many of the disease hazards 
to which miners are subject, especially the respiratory ailments due 
to inhaling powder fumes and foul air in general. Germany is 
gradually introducing this improvement in mining, and the mines of 
Alabama and West Virginia are already extensively worked by 
water power. It is also planned to introduce it in Indiana, Illinois 
and Oklahoma coal mines. Water is forced into the seams through 
drill holes, with the effect of cracking the coal so that it is easily 
broken with a pick. 

Much of the handling of the finer grades of coal, as in shipping 
and in stoking large furnaces, is now done by machinery, so that the 
shoveler or stoker is exposed to less serious dust inhalation than for- 
merly; still, much of this work must always be done by hand. 

In Germany and Belgium the practice prevails for coal miners 
to take shower baths and change their clothing at the pit-head before 
going home, which is a great advance in promoting the cleanliness 
of the home, where washing facilities are often inadequate. In this 
country, on the other hand, it is the common custom for the miner 
on returning from work to enter public conveyances and his home 



MINING 615 

with clothes and body begrimed with dirt and sweat, a most uncom- 
fortable, unhygienic and demoralizing method. 

Stokers are subject to even more dust inhalation than miners, 
for they use the finely crushed coal, and, although not exposed to 
the hazards of smoke from blasting, they are exposed to great heat, 
and often work in very confined spaces, as in the holds of steam- 
ships, underground cellars, etc. Coming out into the cool air, they 
often drink large quantities of cold water to replace the water lost 
by perspiration. In this manner they chill the body surface, over- 
tax the kidneys, and may develop gastritis and chronic nephritis. 
(See Fig. 73, page 416.) 

MINERAL MINING 

The mortality from respiratory diseases among metal or mineral 
miners in Cornwall is three-and-one-half times greater than among 
British coal miners, and S. C. Hotchkiss found it four times greater 
in the mineral mines of Colorado. This is no doubt due to the fact 
that the particles of mineral dusts are more angular and irritating 
than those of coal, and may be composed of poisonous substances 
which are more or less soluble, like lead, for example. The form of 
pulmonary fibrosis caused by the mineral dusts is known as silicosis. 
Poisonous gases, too, are common in certain mineral mines. Sili- 
cosis was found by Hotchkiss in 30 per cent, of the deaths among 
mineral miners in Colorado, and their total mortality showed 56 
per cent, of respiratory diseases, certainly a very serious hazard. 
Silicosis is very prevalent also in the South African mineral mines 
and elsewhere. It has been disputed that lead poisoning is found 
among lead miners, but S. C. Hotchkiss, in an investigation for the 
United States Bureau of Mines, found records of 39 cases treated 
in St. Vincent's Hospital in Leadville within four years. 

Prevention. One of the most important of the recent advances 
in mining sanitation and hygiene is the establishment by the United 
States Bureau of mines of rescue stations placed adjacent to large 
mines. They are fitted with "first-aid" rescue appliances and are 
in charge of experts who give instruction to miners in rescuing their 



616 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

comrades from poisoning by gases, fumes of powder, etc., and in the 
avoidance of these and other risks. The system of the Bureau also 
includes rescue cars which differ from the fixed stations mainly in 
being portable, conveying rescue equipment and supplies. (See 
Figs. 22 and 23, pages 145-6. General prophylactic measures for 
all mines should consist of adequate ventilation, the enforcement of 
rigid rules as to not working in air known to be seriously polluted, 
the prevention of spread of excrement, furnishing the workmen with 
proper facilities for washing and changing their clothing on leaving 
the mine, the dampening of dust by water sprays, and the compul- 
sory periodic examination of the men by physicians. 



II. MASONS AND PLASTERERS 

Masons, plasterers and concrete mixers are subject to much ex- 
posure to dampness, cold, and, in new buildings, to drafts. They 
also inhale much dust of tile, brick, lime, plaster of Paris, gypsum, 
and cement. They are subject, from these combined conditions, 
to catarrhs of the respiratory passages, and such diseases as asthma, 
bronchitis, rhinitis, and atelectasis are frequently met with among 
them. They very often show rhinitis, and Ropke points out that by 
"picking" the nose with plaster or mortar-covered fingers they may 
produce superficial ulceration of the nasal mucosa. They some- 
times suffer from catarrh of the middle ear and frequently from 
conjunctivitis. 

Rheumatism is quite common among masons, as shown by a 
statistical table compiled in 1905 by the Berlin Masons' Association 
which gave 3T4 cases among 5,695 masons. In the same group 
the cases of various affections of the respiratory system numbered 
452. Among the latter were 22 fatal cases. Sticker gives the aver- 
age expectation of life among masons as only 55 years, but this 
includes the various industrial accidents, alcoholism, tuberculosis and 
other conditions not necessarily concerned with dust inhalation. Hirt 
gives the statistics of examination of 1,038 masons. Among them 
34 per cent, sooner or later suffered from respiratory diseases ; more 



617 

than one-third of this number had tuberculosis. These cases in- 
cluded the hazard of hammering stones and bricks, thereby breaking 
off fine particles of sharp, hard character. The mixers of mortar 
also deal with fine sand. These hazards, as in stone cutters, may 
give rise to "chalicosis" or pulmonary fibrosis, as the chronic inter- 
stitial connective tissue inflammation of the lung produced by the 
mechanical irritation of the stone or sand dust is called. (Page 
33.) 

I lately showed in my clinic a plasterer who for four months 
had suffered from fibrinous pleurisy, with atelectasis of the right 
lower and middle lobes of the lung. He had been employed in 
plastering for 20 years, and had always been well, excepting attacks 
of hay fever in August for several years, which possibly were in- 
duced by the plaster dust as an underlying source of Schneiderian 
irritation. In fact, he stoutly maintained that "plastering is an 
uncommon healthy trade." But I have heard house painters assert 
the same of their trade. Just prior to his attack of pleurisy and 
bronchiectasis, however, he began to use a great deal of plaster of 
Paris, mixed with water and lime into a paste, and added by means 
of a sifter. The fine dust proved extremely irritating to the lungs. 

Ascher, of Berlin, found that among the masons who are much 
exposed to inclement weather and strain of frequent stooping, lum- 
bago and sciatica are very common, being present at some time or 
another in fully half the workmen who were more than 45 years 
of age. 

Masons and plasterers frequently suffer from cutaneous irrita- 
tion. The coarse material which they handle clings to the hands 
and may cause blisters and infected pustules. Fissures form over 
the knuckles and between the fingers which are slow of healing, 
owing to constant irritation. Such lesions may appear in various 
folds or creases in the skin of the body, where dust has penetrated 
through the clothing. Chronic eczema is very common in the neigh- 
borhood of these lesions and may extend over a considerable surface. 
The skin of the palms becomes infiltrated and greatly thickened, 
more so, in fact, than in almost any other trade. Rarely, infection 
may occur through the cutaneous abrasions and give rise to localized 



618 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

lymphangitis. The ears and eyelids frequently are affected by 
eczematous lesions. In handling cement the hands may be pro- 
tected to some extent by greasing them with fat oil, simple cerate 
or vaselin. Treatment of the skin lesions is described on page 595. 

Closely allied to the conditions above described are those which 
affect the so-called building "wreckers" who have to tear down 
masonry and plaster, and often inhale clouds of dust. 

Prevention. Prevention consists in shielding the workmen as 
much as possible from inclement weather and cold, damp indoor 
air in new buildings. Masons should stand upon lattice frames to 
keep the feet dry. Whenever possible building material, especially 
when being torn down, should be wetted with a hose, and workmen 
should be instructed to hold the breath when confronted with a sud- 
den cloud of dust, as when a mass of plaster falls or a load of cement, 
bricks or sand is dumped. Masons, in hammering bricks or stone, 
should learn to stand so that dust is blown from and not toward 
them. Workmen sometimes put wet cotton in the nose as a filter, 
not realizing that in mouth breathing the hazard is greater. In 
some cases, as in tearing down old plaster in confined spaces, in 
tunnels, etc., where sprinkling cannot be resorted to, respirators may 
be worn temporarily. 

III. ROOFERS 

Those roofers who work constantly on sharply inclined surfaces 
may acquire peculiar weakness of the legs with tremors, amounting 
to a partial paralysis (Bruno Bosse). If employed in laying cop- 
per or tin roofs, they handle solder and are more or less exposed to 
lead poisoning. Tar is also considerably used in roofing (the risks 
of handling which are described on page 383). In summer metal 
roofs become greatly heated, and I have seen insolation among 
roofers employed on them. 



IV. BRICK AND TILE MAKERS 

In these industries the workmen are exposed to the hazards of 
constant wetting in the clay beds, overheating of the ovens, the in- 



halation of clay and other dusts, besides those of lead used in glazing 
and various coloring materials, iron filings, etc. They may acquire 
chronic eczema of the hands. I saw a case of lead poisoning in a 
man employed in unloading from canal barges tiles which had been 
treated with a new form of lead glaze. The glazing of tiles with 
lead glaze is one of the industries in which women are employed 
about equally in number with men, but in pottery glazing, with 
kiln work, there are comparatively few women employed (Ham- 
ilton) . 



V. POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 

Nature of the Industry. Pottery making is one of the oldest in- 
dustries known to man, being of prehistoric origin. Apart from the 
pottery of the Cliff and Cave Dwellers, the first manufacture of it 
by civilized man in this country was conducted at a pottery opened 
by Dr. Coxe in 1685 in Burlington, New Jersey, and to this day 
that State, with Ohio, owing to local geological conditions of clay 
formation, comprise the centers of the American industry. In New 
York State, in 1908, there were 21 potteries, employing 751 men, 
422 women and 59 boys and girls under 16 years of age. 

In the making of pottery, tiles, sanitary and electric insulation 
ware, china and porcelain the processes employed are essentially 
alike, and consist of grinding and mixing the clay (or flint, in the 
case of china) with water to a consistency which enables it to retain 
a given shape on being molded. The articles thus formed receive 
a first firing in very hot kilns, being heated to 2,500 F., and subse- 
quently are brushed and scoured. They then are dipped into various 
solutions to impart glaze and color, and the glaze, which often con- 
tains white lead among other substances, is fixed by successive firings. 
The glaze has further a protective action, being practically a fluid 
glass which prevents the pottery from being too much altered in 
further processes of firing, for, as Graham-Rogers says in his report 
on the Pottery Industry in New York State, made in 1909 for the 
Bureau of Factory Inspection, "with gradually increasing tempera- 



620 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

ture the same mixture may successively assume the texture and char- 
acter of sun-baked ware, terracotta, stoneware, porcelain and glass." 
The larger pottery wares are cast in molds made of plaster of Paris, 
into which they are pressed by machinery, the surplus clay being 
removed by scrapers on a revolving disc called a jigger, on which 
the molds are placed. All these processes involve considerable 
rehandling of the articles undergoing manufacture, for comparatively 
little of the work, excepting the mixing and grinding, can be done 
by machinery. 

The finishing of the ware, when the process is carried beyond 
glazing, consists in painting with metallic paints and gilding, with 
subsequent refiring and perhaps polishing. This is sedentary work, 
involving no special danger except that of applying metallic 
paints. It is done by hand on the finer ware, but most of the work 
is accomplished by lithographic transfer. In this process the paint 
is stamped or otherwise placed on paper patterns which are laid 
on the pottery, so that the paint adheres when the paper is removed 
by a damp cloth. Subsequent refiring fixes the painted pattern per- 
manently. The paint may be applied either before or after the 
glazing process. 

The paints, which are usually chrome or cobalt compounds, are 
mixed with diluents. Commonly turpentine is used, but sometimes 
paraifin, petroleum, wood alcohol or essential oils are added. In 
the gilding of pottery and china turpentine and various oils are now 
used, but originally the gold was amalgamated with mercury and 
mixed with oil, and the mercury evaporated in the refiring of the 
ware. The gold is subsequently burnished to bring out its luster. 

The fine mineral dust produced in pottery manufacture is com- 
posed of clay (a hydrated silicate of aluminum), feldspar and flint 
(a silicious variety of quartz), and the dust of glaze contains also 
borax, Cornish stone, carbonate of lime, kaolin, lead oxid and car- 
bonate. "Fritted" lead, sometimes used for glaze, is a fused com- 
pound with borax and silica, in handling which there is less risk than 
from the ordinary glaze mixture, as it is less soluble. 

Translucent china ware has added to the clay calcined bone or 
feldspar. The Limoges ware is derived from white Kaolin clay. 



POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 621 

The glaze is a mixture of silica, silica borate and white lead, red 
lead or lead sulphid (galena). Cobalt is used to produce a jet- 
black glaze, and manganese a brown or purple color. Tiles are 
made from molded clay dust under heavy pressure. 

In the making of porcelain tiles which are pressed in a die, each 
time the die descends in the press fine dust is blown out. 

Hazards. Dr. J. T. Arlidge states that "the pottery industry 
stands nearly at the head of the list of unhealthful occupations." 
The various menaces to health which exist in this industry arise 
from dust, lead poisoning and exposure to excessive heat and 
moisture. 

Some years ago Dr. Lemaistre published an analysis of the dust 
in the air of the workrooms of the potteries of Limoges, France, 
which was found to be a mixture of kaolin, flint, granite, dried glaze, 
wood charcoal and soot. This dust was estimated to be present in 
the proportion of 640 million particles per cubic meter of air. 

These several hazards have been mitigated greatly of late years 
by installation of mechanical clay mixers and other types of machin- 
ery. The chief dangers to health have always existed in the clay- 
mixing and molding rooms, and in the dipping rooms, where glaze 
containing lead is often applied. But there are other factors of 
ill health. In former years plumbism was so common among laborers 
in the slip or dipping rooms that the majority who pursued this line 
of work failed to live beyond their fortieth year. Much of the earlier 
high death rate from the pottery industry was doubtless chargeable 
in great part to excessive drinking, which was common among the 
low grade of foreign workmen at first employed. American work- 
men have now largely replaced them in American potteries and 
their drinking habits and social conditions are better. 

In the clay-mixing and molding rooms clay and plaster of Paris, 
which are dropped upon the floor, dry and are pulverized by the work- 
men's feet, and raised into clouds of dust unless frequently removed 
by sweeping, which should be done only at night. The sweepers 
inhale considerable dust, but pass quickly through the rooms with 
open windows, which is quite different from sitting all day in a closed 
room, inhaling irritant dust The finer clays used are in such a 



622 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

high degree of pulverization that the dust they beget is exceedingly 
fine and penetrating. Unless properly conducted, however, the sweep- 
ing stirs up dust which settles upon sills, benches and rafters, and is 
set in motion by the blowers of hot air which is supplied for heating 
the rooms in winter. Wetting the dust before sweeping merely re- 
duces it to adhesive clay again, and vacuum cleaners are beyond the 
means of most potteries, being expensive to install and operate. 




FIG. 110. DIPPING TABLE CHINA INTO LEAD GLAZE. A most unhygienic 
room, with glaze dripping or spattering all about. Note the glaze on the 
man's hand and the absence of gloves. Women are much employed in this 
industry. 

Workmen in the mixing and molding rooms are exposed more 
or less constantly to wet and often to excessive atmospheric humidity 
and suffer frequently from sciatica, lumbago and chronic or sub- 
acute rheumatism. 

In the British potteries the ware is dipped by the workman's 
hands directly into the glaze (Fig. 110), but the French workmen 
use tongs for the purpose. In either case there is danger from spat- 



POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 623 

tering the fluid, which subsequently dries and gives rise to much 
dust. 

"Ground-laying" is another highly dangerous process. The ware, 
already partly glazed, is covered with an adhesive oil and powdered 
dry lead enamel color is dusted on with a cotton pad. This process 
has quite recently been largely replaced by the less hazardous 
method of blowing on the powder by means of a compressed air 
jet. 

The kilnmen or firers are subject to several hazards. Such are: 
exposure to excessive heat, inhalation of coal dust and of coal gas 
from the ovens, and dust on removing the biscuited and glazed 
ware. As the kiln chambers are large, the kilnmen have to enter 
them to bring out the ware after firing, and are thus exposed to 
great extremes of temperature whenever a kiln is "drawn" and they 
have to go in and out repeatedly. They perspire very freely, and 
W. C. Garrison writes (in a Report on Health Conditions of the 
Pottery Industry in New Jersey in 1905) : "Draughts are quite 
frequent where this work is performed, and a not inconsiderable 
amount of illness of at least a temporary character is caused 
thereby." The workmen often expose themselves to the outdoor air, 
seeking prompt relief from the heat. Such exposure chills the body 
surface, raises blood pressure and tends to overtax the kidneys and 
heart. It is also a source of more or less bronchial irritation and 
asthma; the so-called "potter's asthma" is very prevalent among 
these workmen, as it is among those who work in the more dusty 
rooms. 

After the first baking or "biscuiting" the ware is brushed and 
scoured to cleanse it from roughness and from adherent materials of 
various sorts (Fig. 111). In Limoges, France, and other places 
where high-grade porcelain table ware is made the plates, cups, 
saucers, etc., before firing, are placed on trays called "saggers," and 
separated from each other by a hard flint earth or sand. This pre- 
vents them from sticking together, but in the subsequent brushing 
or "scouring" process much flint dust is added to that of the china, 
a dust which is so fine, hard and sharp that it is very liable to cause 
pneumonoconiosis. In the United States much of the brushing of 



624 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

pottery is done by women, whose hair and clothing become saturated 
with very fine dust. 

China and semi-porcelain are mainly manufactured from kaolin, 
calcined flint and calcined bone ash, pulverized and treated by great 
heat. The brushing or scouring of the biscuited ware is most irri- 




FIG. 111. WARE-CLEANING ROOM. (Taylor, Tunnicliffe and Co., Hanley, 
England.) "Women workers sit around the room at convenient distances, 
each one before a large photographic dish, shaped in front so as to fit to 
the body of the worker. This dish contains water, and all the larger particles 
of glaze fall into it and are retained. Immediately behind and above the 
dish is an opening into a large fan duct, so that the fine dust is also carried 
away; and the room is always kept in a condition of great cleanliness." 
(From the Shaw Lecture by William Burton, F. C. S., on "Hygiene of the 
Pottery Trade," Royal Society of Arts, London, Feb. 7, 1908.) 

tating to the eyes and respiratory system. This branch of the work, 
as well as all the others in which dust is excessive, is liable to pro- 
duce bronchitis, bronchial asthma, and pneumonoconiosis. The ten- 
dency to tuberculosis among potters in England was formerly so 
great that the disease was called "potter's rot." In the Limoges 
works formerly one-half of the deaths among potters were due to 
tuberculosis. 



POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 625 

The disease may develop upon a pulmonary fibrosis caused by 
mineral dust inhalation, or attack those weakened by constant ex- 
posure to extremes of temperature and moisture, with alternate ex- 
cessive perspiration and sudden cooling of the body. It is also much 
favored by the chronic bronchitis due to dust inhalation and by 
the undermining of the workman's constitution due to chronic 
plumbism. 

Arlidge found from statistics gathered prior to 1892, or more 
than 20 years ago, that the general mortality from respiratory dis- 
eases among workmen, exclusive of potters, was 7.86 per cent., 
whereas among potters it was 12.29 per cent., and, the general mor- 
tality from consumption being 9.27 per cent., that among potters 
rose to 12.90 per cent. In estimating such results the type of work- 
men engaged in the industry should be reckoned with. Ignorant 
workmen of low social grade who are more likely to spend their 
wages for drink than food, and take no precautions against the pos- 
sible dangers of health to which they may be exposed, quite naturally 
tend to augment the death rate of any trade. Certainly no such ex- 
cessive mortality exists among potters in the United States to-day, 
for among the 3,751 potters whose condition was investigated by 
W. C. Garrison in K^ew Jersey, the death rate for 1905 was only 2.3 
per cent. 

Arlidge also reported plumbism among 8 per cent of male pot- 
ters and 5.06 per cent, among female pottery workers. Ten years 
later Sir Thomas Oliver found these conditions in England con- 
siderably improved, and doubtless the better understanding of gen- 
eral hygiene, and of tuberculosis brought about in the past decade 
explains the marked lowering of mortality in the pottery industry, 
combined, as it is, with employment of a much higher grade of 
workmen. 

In 1908, in a lecture before the Royal Society of Arts, Mr. 
William Burton stated that whereas there were 73,000 pottery em- 
ployees in England, only 26,000 were exposed to any form of dust, 
of whom 19,000 may be exposed to flint or clay dust and the re- 
mainder to lead dust. For the five years from 1901 to 1906 there 
were an average of 92 cases per annum of serious lead poisoning 



626 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

among some 6,700 workmen and women exposed to the risk. In 
1909 the number fell to 58. This is a great improvement, certainly, 
over earlier conditions, but it is the common experience that, where 
cases of plumbism are serious enough to be reported by laymen, 
physicians can detect many additional cases of more insidious type. 
(See Lead Poisoning, page 242.) Among these 485 cases reported 
by Burton in the five years' record, 205 were among men and 280 
among women. 

Men employed in handling the pottery to arrange it upon "sag- 
gers" or fire-clay boxes, are known as "biscuit placers" and "glost 
placers." The former handle the ware in relation to its first firing 
and are exposed only to inhalation of mineral dust, but the latter 
handle the ware after it has been glazed, and often while the glaze 
is still moist upon it; hence they become liable to lead poisoning. 
In the dipping process the arms of the workmen are sometimes 
entirely immersed in the lead solution, which in this country has 
usually a strength of 10 per cent., but as the absorption of lead by 
the skin is a negligible factor, there is more risk from spattering the 
solution into the mouth or allowing it to dry and become pulverized 
upon unclean floors. Ware cleaning is much more dangerous than 
dipping. 

W. C. Garrison, in a study of 3,751 pottery workers in New 
Jersey in 1905, 18 per cent of whom were women or girls, writes 
of pottery and china painting: "Enamel painting, if done with 
ordinary care and attention, is rarely productive of injury, even 
where the colors contain lead; but in ornamenting very common 
ware the colors are mixed with gum water, and, being put on rather 
thickly and carelessly, the worker's hands are coated with the mix- 
ture, and in some instances lead poisoning follows." 

When certain lead colors are diluted with water and applied 
thickly over the surface of the ware the water evaporates and lead 
dust is liberated, often in dangerous quantity. Sometimes the ap- 
plication is made by a spraying or atomizing apparatus worked with 
compressed air (aerographing), which gives rise to much less dust 
that may be blown backward toward the operator. 

In the process of gilding the vapors of turpentine and oils vitiate 



POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 627 

the air of ill-ventilated rooms, and novices at the work suffer from 
headache and indigestion. 

In the burnishing process gum water is provided to moisten the 
gilt surface, but Garrison says that employees usually prefer to use 
their saliva instead, with the result of impairing the digestion of 
amylaceous foods. 

In Hungary much pottery is still manufactured in the homes of 
the workmen who use the family stove and kitchen in the process 
with most disastrous results to the women and children. Here, Dr. 
Oliver says, in Bulletin No. 95 of the United States Bureau of 
Labor, 1911 : "I found a child 6 years of age who had suffered 
from saturnine encephalopathy, which had left him with cramped 
limbs, legs flexed upon abdomen, head retracted, eyeballs paralyzed, 
loss of control of the sphincters, and with defective mental develop- 
ment. Saturnine meningitis in children usually proves fatal within 
two or three days, or there is an incomplete recovery with such 
sequelae as I have mentioned. 

"Dr. Chyzer found in the blouse of the son of a potter, aged 5 
years, and on whose gums there was a well-marked blue line, lead to 
the extent of 0.243 gram, and in his cap 0.0144 gram of lead. 

"I have never seen such widespread suffering from lead poison- 
ing, nor have I witnessed such harrowing sights as those I saw 
among the Hungarian potters who make their trade a home in- 
dustry. Young men paralyzed in hands, face and feet, help- 
less, and unable to dress and feed themselves ; women paralyzed ; 
children imbecile and blind, paralyzed in their legs, or suffering 
from colic, and all of them with a well-marked blue line on their 
gums." 

He continues: "The domestic animals, too, do not escape. A 
potter cannot keep in his house a singing bird nor can he rear fowls 
in the courtyard, for the dried splashed lead glaze rapidly kills them. 
Cats are extremely susceptible to lead. They suffer from colic, and 
in their agony they roll upon the ground, bending their limbs toward 
their body, or they strike their abdomen against the floor, mewing 
as if in pain. In some of these animals symptoms akin to madness 
arise. Losing control of themselves, they run wildly about, heedless

of obstacles, or they throw themselves into water and are drowned. 
In one instance a cat in its agony leaped into the fire." 

I once lost a valuable Angora cat with precisely these symptoms, 
which became accidentally poisoned by licking fresh lead paint off its 
paws. 

The preceding dust determinations in the pottery industry are 
quoted by Ditman in the Journal of Industrial Safety (vol. ii, No. 3, 
March, 1912). (Tables I and II.) 

Prevention. Cleaning the floors, workbenches and tables by night 
only and installation of exhaust fans to remove dust, turpentine and 
other vapors will abolish the evils of the molding, brushing and fin- 
ishing rooms to a great extent. The excessive moisture attending the 
mixing and the excessive dry heat to which the kilnmen and "plac- 
ers" are subjected is a necessary incident to the labor which it is 
practically impossible to relieve. The "dippers" who place the ware 
in the enameling solutions and the glost placers who carry it should 



630 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

be protected from lead dust and moist lead enamel by daily bathing 
after work, thorough cleansing of the hands before eating, and fre- 
quent exchanging of soiled for clean overalls. (Details of the pre- 
vention of lead poisoning are given on page 271.) 

Brushing and scouring of pottery and china should be done by 
machinery or, if by hand, the ware should be held in boxes with 
small openings, and provided with strong suction ducts to screen and , 
draw off the dust. 

The Worcester Royal Porcelain Company employ a sandblast 
for this purpose. The ware to be cleaned is held by the operator 
inside a cabinet by passing his hands through an opening in a small 
cloth screen. (See Fig. 62, page 392.) The cabinet is connected 
with a strong suction fan and the operator looks in through a glass 
window. For further protection he also wears a respirator. Another 
method of securing complete dust protection for women employed in 
sandblast scouring consists in placing the ware upon traveling wooden 
racks which convey it in and out of the scouring cabinet, while the 
operator does not even have to place the hands inside. By such 
means risks of pulmonary cirrhosis and tuberculosis are being prac- 
tically completely eliminated from this class of workers in what for- 
merly was one of the most dangerous of all the industries. Still 
further improvement has been made by Mr. Fainford, of Stafford- 
shire, who invented a process to do away with sandblasting. The 
china is placed in a revolving drum or rumbler (Fig. 112) and 
fragments of broken china are added which rub all the adhering 
flint off the ware. An exhaust duct removes the dust, so that the 
ware comes cut clean and smooth. 

Respirators may be worn in the more dusty places, especially 
where flint and lead dust are in suspension in the air. 

Owing to the insidious development of fibroid phthisis, as well 
as many of the symptoms of lead poisoning, all potters should un- 
dergo a thorough physical examination by a competent physician 
at least four t'imes a year, and oftener should symptoms of any kind 
arise between the regular examination periods, particularly such as 
colic or muscular weakness. 

In certain types of pottery other materials may be substituted 



POTTERY MAKING, CHINA AND PORCELAIN 631 

for lead in glazing, as in making salt-glazed stoneware, but nothing 
-has yet been found which will wholly replace lead for the finer sorts. 
One process consists in "fritting" the glaze with silicious material, 
so as to make the lead insoluble in weak acids, like that of the 
gastric juice. It is 
not practicable, how- 
ever, to reduce the 
soluble lead to less 
than 5 per cent., and 
even that does not 
produce the best re- 
sults in glazing. 

Improvements in 
-the British pottery 
industry, largely due 
to the efforts of Sir 
Thomas Oliver, have 
reduced the number 
of cases of plumbism 
arising from this 
work from 457 cases 
and 17 deaths in 
1898 to 58 cases and 
5 deaths in 1909. 

That pottery 
molding, when dust 
is reduced to a mini- 
mum and lead glaze 
is not used, is not 
necessarily unhealth- 
ful is shown by the 
fact that in the Are- 
quipa Sanatorium in 




FIG. 112. CHINA SCOURING BY "RUMBLER." (Doul- 
ton and Co., Burslem, England.) The plates or 
dishes after glazing and re-baking are placed in 
racks which are set inside the large drum where 
they are rotated with fragments of china or 
other scouring material. All escape of lead and 
other dust is thus prevented. (From Shaw Lec- 
ture by William Burton, F. C. S., onj" Hygiene 
of the Pottery Trade," Royal Society of Arts, 
London, Feb. 7, 1908.) 



California for tuberculous women, this occupation was introduced 
with much benefit by Dr. P. K. Brown. The work is conducted out- 
doors and the pottery is kept as free from dust as possible. The 



632 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

work interests the patients, who are permitted to sell their products, 
and has proved in every way beneficial. 



VI. CHEMICAL WORKERS 



Workers in the various chemical industries employed in the deri- 
vation or production of all manner of chemical materials are sub- 
ject to very many serious diseases. They may acquire eye and skin 
lesions, respiratory, circulatory and nervous diseases, besides acute 
gastro-intestinal ailments. These are described under the subhead- 
ings of the particular industries in which the hazards occur. In 
Germany, in 1905, it was computed that among 185,820 chemical 
workers there were 163,522 cases of occupational disease, or 88 
per cent of men employed were affected in one way or another, with 
an average incapacity for work of 8 days per man. There were 122 
deaths, or 1.11 per cent. Such figures afford an idea of the excep- 
tional disease hazards of these trades, in addition to the trade acci- 
dents which may arise in the employment. 



VII. FERTILIZERS 

The making of both bone and mineral fertilizers exposes the work- 
men to much dust and to the inhalation of acid fumes of various 
kinds. In handling the carboys of acid the hands may be burned, 
or the acid may spatter into the face and injure the eyes. There is 
also a stench which to those unaccustomed to it is intolerable, but it 
is not necessarily injurious to the health of the workmen. One of 
the processes used in making bone meal fertilizer employs benzene 
for extraction of fat, which adds considerably to the offensiveness 
of the odors. 

Mineral superphosphates are prepared by pouring bags of pow- 
dered phosphate into a mixer into which sulphuric acid is drawn* 
from a tank. The mass is then emptied into a pit, where it hardens 
and is dug out with pickaxes and ground. This process exposes the 
workmen both to dust and acid fumes. If sodium nitrate be added, 



FERTILIZERS 633 

nitric acid may be liberated. According to C. F. W. Doehring 
(Bulletin of the U. S. Bureau of Labor,. No. 44, 1903), the work- 
men in artificial fertilizer factories often suffer from gastro-intestinal 
catarrh, and sometimes from hemoptysis, as a result of inhaling acid 
fumes. When nitrate of potassium is added in a fertilizer mixture 
with acid superphosphate, both nitrous and nitric acids are devel- 
oped from which he says "direct cases of poisoning have been ob- 
served." In some of the mixtures hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and 
sulphurous acid fumes may also be liberated, and the hydrofluoric 
acid vapor is especially irritating to the respiratory passages and 
very poisonous. 

According to Doehring, the dust arising from grinding basic slag 
is very harmful, and he reports 13 cases of severe pulmonary dis- 
eases occurring in a short time in one factory where the slag dust 
contained iron oxid, magnesia, lime phosphate, quicksilver, silica 
and aluminum. The slag, which is a waste product from the manu- 
facture of steel, has to be ground extremely fine. It contains on 
an average as much as 17 per cent, of phosphoric pentoxid, hence 
its value as a source of phosphates for the soil when properly pre- 
pared. 

Symptoms. The various dusts may produce bronchitis, fibroid 
phthisis and asthma. The acid fumes may give rise to bronchial 
irritation, hemoptysis, anemia and cardiac weakness. Another 
special hazard is found among the men who skin the carcasses of 
dead animals, such as horses, preparatory to boiling them and reduc- 
ing the bones. It is the danger of septicemia from abrasions of the 
hands which become infected with putrid animal matter. General 
as well as localized sepsis may thus occur. 

Prevention. Prevention demands ventilation, removal of dust 
and fumes by forced suction drafts, protection of the eyes with 
goggles against the spattering of acids, and special care in handling 
the carboys of acid. No one with abrasions of the hands should be 
allowed to handle the animal carcasses. The stench may be miti- 
gated by spraying the air exhausted from the workrooms with live 
Bteam or forcing it through a furnace.

VIII. DYERS 

Dyers make use of a great variety of toxic substances as color- 
ing, bleaching and fixing agents or mordants. Among the most 
important of them are ammonia, the mineral acids, naphtha, gaso- 
lene, chlorid of lime and other bleaching agents, salts of such metals 
as copper, arsenic, iron arid chromium, anilins, wood alcohol, and 
a variety of pigments derived from foreign woods, some of which 
are toxic. The more important of these several poisons are de- 
scribed under their individual headings. 

Hazards. The hazards of the occupation comprise irritation of 
the respiratory system from inhalation of hot vapors and fumes, 
often strongly acid or alkaline, or, as in the case of chlorin, specifi- 
cally poisonous. The workroom is often hot and filled with steam. 
The bare hands and arms may suffer from skin irritations such as 
are described on page 580, or the dyestuffs may spatter into the face 
and injure the eyes. The workmen are in some cases almost con- 
stantly wet from their own perspiration, from spattering the cloth- 
ing, or absorption by the clothing of the moisture from the kettles 
where hot processes are used. Anemia and digestive disorders, too, 
are observed. (Fig. 113.) 

As an example of some of the hazards of dyers, dermatitis is 
caused by potassium bichromate solution, much used in dyeing, in 
the usual strength of Ib. to 100 gallons of water, in which the 
goods to be dyed are boiled for an hour. K. P. White has reported 
in the Lancet of January 29, 1910, two such cases in dyers. The 
eruption involved the backs of the hands, forearms, face and exposed 
part of the chest, and was of the nature of an areola in which was a 
scaly papule. This form of chrome pigment does not usually affect 
the unbroken skin, but dyers, whose hands are constantly wet with 
hot fluids or steam, perspire freely and the skin of the hands tends 
to become thickened and encrusted, and to show deep fissures 
through which irritant substances may act. Accumulation of sweat 
and dirt on the exposed skin adds to the trouble. 

One of the patients, a man 52 years of age, who was shown at 



DYEES 



635 



my clinic in 1908, had been for many years a dyer of ostrich feathers, 
in which process he had handled with bare hands arsenic and oxalic 
and hydrochloric acid solutions. He had also inhaled much dust 
laden with starch, oxalic acid and arsenic. He presented no neu-

sores, lead poisoning, and wetting. 

ritis, but had a chronic bronchitis. He had had bronchial hemor- 
rhage, and an attack of right-sided hemiplegia, which would imply 
arterial degeneration. He also had well-marked diabetes with 1.3 
per cent, of sugar by polariscope. This latter disease, however, may 
have been incidental or not of occupational origin. The sputum 
showed numerous tubercle bacilli. 

Another of my patients who was a dyer was in the habit of wash- 
ing his hands in a lime and soda solution, but had escaped any 
deleterious consequences of his occupation which he had followed 
for 9 years. 

Treatment. To protect the hands in temporary work rubber 



636 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

gloves may be used, but they cause sweating and are hot, uncom- 
fortable and clumsy. It is better, therefore, to keep the hands well 
greased, if possible, and R. P. White suggests that the instruments

employed to lift yarn, cloth, etc., out of the dyeing solutions be pro- 
tected by shields like a sword guard, to prevent the solutions from 
running up the hands and arms. 

At best dyeing is dirty work, and it is difficult to avoid saturating 
the clothing. Rubber aprons and rubber boots may be worn, and 



JEWELRY INDUSTRY 637 

the feet should be protected further from wet floors by standing 
upon raised slats or grills. Clothing should be changed before going 
home, and ample washing facilities are most important, as de- 
scribed on page 91. 

IX. ELECTROPLATING 

The chief risk in this employment, which is most serious, is from 
poisoning by red lead, and it is described in detail under that 
heading (page 209). But the process has other minor hazards. 
(Fig. 114.) Powdered lime in oil is used in finishing and sour 
beer in "scratch brushing," and these substances cause considerable 
irritation of the skin, resulting in dermatosis of the forearms and 
hands. ( Fordyce. ) 

X. LITHOGRAPHERS AND ENGRAVERS, LITHOTRANSFER 

Lithographers and engravers suffer from myopia. Also, from 
sedentary work and close application, they may acquire dyspepsia 
and anemia. They make use of a variety of acids and may^ acquire 
eczema and other cutaneous lesions, described under Diseases of the 
Skin, page 580. They have a somewhat high mortality from tuber- 
culosis. 

Lithotransfer work involves serious hazard from lead poisoning, 
and is described upon page 232. 

XI. JEWELRY INDUSTRY 

The metals used most extensively in jewelry manufacture are 
gold, silver and platinum. Brass is much employed in making the 
cheapest articles of personal adornment, such as collar and shirt 
buttons and studs. Lead solder is also used to some extent. 

Although the various metals employed are ground into dust to 
some extent in the operations of filing, polishing, etc., the quantity 
thus liberated is so small as compared with many other industries 



638 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

that their irritant effects are negligible. Neither are the soluble 
silver and lead solder liable to prove toxic. The danger to the eyes 
and respiratory system from these dusts has been much reduced by 
the almost universal introduction in jewelry factories of strong ex- 
haust fans "with separate ducts leading to each source of dust pro- 
duction, for they have the economic advantage that the dust is drawn 
off into iron reservoirs, where it is wetted and valuable particles of 
metal are recovered. 

The hazards of the jewelry industry, therefore, arise chiefly in 
other ways, as from inhalation of fumes of the strong inorganic 
acids used in "coloring" and gilding processes, as well as from acids 
used in refining the gold and silver. Some operatives suffer from 
eye strain, from the nearness with which bright metallic objects are 
held to the eyes in polishing, and also from sitting in cramped 
positions at their work. William Stainsby, who has made a special 
study of 2,721 jewelry workers in Newark, states: "The jewelers' 
work in all its branches is particularly trying to the eyes, and it 
not infrequently happens that defective sight compels men to aban- 
don the trade who are in every other respect capable and competent 
to follow it for years to come." 

The" danger of inhaling acid fumes does not differ in this in- 
dustry from the effects of this hazard in general, and is described 
under the titles of the several corrosive acids. (Page 367.) 



XII. TANNING AND LEATHER DRESSING 

The leather industry ranks as the third greatest manufacturing 
industry in the United States, the steel industry standing first and 
that of drygoods second. About 250,000 employees are found in 
the entire leather industry of the United States, some 50,000 of 
whom are in the tanning and leather dressing industry, the re- 
mainder being mainly shoemakers and harness makers. 

Nature of the Tanning and Leather Dressing Industry. This proc- 
ess is complicated and prolonged, and involves much laborious hand 
work. The hides or skins are washed and salted, which prevents 



TANNING AND LEATHER DRESSING 



639 



decomposition. After a fortnight the hides are washed for another 
week in water, then soaked in lime for a few days to loosen the hair. 
The hair is next scraped off in what is termed the "beam house," 
again soaked in lime for four or five days. After this "fleshing" is 




FIG. 115. TANNING ALLIGATOR SKINS. Hazards: acids, lime, heat and 

moisture. 



performed, i. e., any still adherent particles of fat or fascia are 
removed and then the hide is placed in the first tanning tank, where 
it is soaked for several weeks in tanning extracts. The hide is next 
taken out and split by machinery into the desired thickness. A 
second immersion in the tanning fluid follows, after which the hide 
is scoured, stretched on frames and dried in the sun and air or 
otherwise. For further treatment the hide must be softened and 
then japanned, glazed and grained. Dyeing, polishing and enamel- 
ing are additional processes in the industry. 

Hazards. Most of these processes demand care and skill. The 
workmen are obliged to be wet much of the time, from lifting hides 



into and out of the vats and in handling bundles of large heavy 
hides considerable strength is required. 

The dangers to health in this industry are due to the constant 
exposure to wet and excessive atmospheric humidity and frequent 
changes of temperature, the handling of lime and occasional ex- 
posure to special substances used in dressing or currying processes, 
such as fumes of naphtha and turpentine, employed in the japanning 
process, the extreme heat of the drying room, and various sub- 
stances used in dyeing (Fig. 115). As a further hazard serious 
explosions have occurred from setting fire to the buffing dust of 
chrome-tanned leather. 

The disagreeable odors connected with tanneries are due to a 
mixture of smells from the oil and fat of the skins with lime 
and tanbark or tanning extract. 

Symptoms. Hirt found as a result of examining 54 tanners that 
more than a third were subject to frequent colds, and a number had 
had bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia. Rheumatism is also 
common among this class of workmen and they may suffer from 
varicose veins. Quite a large percentage, nearly ten, develop tuber- 
culosis sooner or later. In Swedish and British tanneries cases of 
gastric fever have been observed quite often. 

All the maceration and tanning processes tend to fill the air with 
foul-smelling and more or less irritating fumes, which are largely 
responsible for the cases of gastric catarrh which are noted among 
many of the workmen. 

In some cases muscular and skeletal deformities have resulted 
from constant irregular use of certain groups of' muscles or faulty 
positions while at work. The hands are often macerated in the lime 
or bark solutions, and the fingers, hands and arms may become the 
seat of eczema, blebs, ulcers and pustules. Ecchymoses are observed, 
which may become excoriated and painful, and on the sides of the 
fingers typical so-called "pigeon spots" may develop, which are small 
areas of erosion with pale, whitish margins of macerated epidermis, 
looking as if they had been cut out with a punch. The perforations 
bleed readily and may be somewhat painful. The finger nails are 
stained brown. (Hannover and Shann.) 



TANNING AND LEATHEE DRESSING 641 

Anthrax is a disease to which tanners who handle imported hides 
are liable, and the disease is described in detail on page 452. In 
England between 1899 and 1904 there were 86 cases among those 
who handled raw skins and hides, of which 21 proved fatal. In 
half the cases the site of the carbuncle was in the neck, which is 
perhaps attributable to the habit of carrying the hides upon the 
shoulder, where they easily irritate and infect the skin of the unpro- 
tected neck* Lindemann collected records of 68 cases occurring in 
Germany in 12 years, with a mortality of over 22 per cent. Non- 
malignant pustules and lymphangitis from infected wounds of the 
hands are also observed in tanners and leather workers. 

In parts of the leather-dressing industry the workmen are sub- 
ject to the fumes of naphtha, amyl acetate and wood alcohol. In 
dressing, trimming, polishing and carving leather much dust is set 
free which is moderately irritating, and may be specifically so, as 
in the following case: 

A man, 45 years of age, presented himself at iny clinic who for 
25 years had worked as a finisher of leather, which he scraped, 
rubbed and polished. The leather had been treated previously with 
an arsenical preservative solution, and much dust was given off in 
the work. Ventilation of the workroom and washing facilities were 
poor and lunch was eaten on a worktable or bench. As a result of 
these poor hygienic conditions the man, who was originally of robust 
physique, acquired a multiple arsenical peripheral neuritis of both 
arms and legs. He had considerable pain and tenderness along the 
course of the peripheral nerves, accompanied by partial loss of mus- 
cular power. 

Nine cases of poisoning of various sorts in the leather industry 
were reported in 1912 to the New York State Labor Bureau, six 
of which were in connection with tanning processes, such as der- 
matitis and ulcers from handling lime and hydrochloric acid, and 
septicemia from contact with "fleshings," or the flesh and fat re- 
moved from skins. In one case the acid got inside the workman's 
rubber gloves and gave rise to. severe dermatitis. To the ulcers, 
which are deep and obstinate in healing, the workmen give the name 
of "chrome holes" (See page 185). 



642 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Amyl acetate is used in preparation of patent-leather. Under 
some conditions its vapor is explosive, and a building was recently 
wrecked in Passaic by explosion of a 60-gallon tank of this sub- 
stance. 

Notwithstanding the apparent insalubrity of these various proc- 
esses they rarely produce any serious permanent disability, and a 
tendency to attacks of rheumatism and to "take cold" represents 
almost the only hazard in the better regulated tanneries. The 
workmen, on the other hand, are often remarkably strong and vigor- 
ous. An investigation of the "Health Conditions of the Leather 
Industry" was made by the New Jersey State Bureau of Statistics 
in 1905. In this State the leather industry is a prominent one, 
amounting to an annual output valued at about $21,000,000. The 
health of nearly 3,000 employees was inquired into, and found 
exceptionally good, better, in fact, than in most occupations involv- 
ing as much hard labor. Only 69 of these men were too ill to work 
at some time during the year, a morbidity rate of only 2.3 per cent., 
and most of their illness was independent of the occupation. The 
death rate was extremely low. Most of the workmen, moreover, 
repudiated the suggestion that there was any hazard in their 
work beyond the tendency to "rheumatism" above referred to, and 
occasional affection of the bowels from turpentine and naphtha in- 
halation. Hard drinking is incompatible with intelligent labor and 
is discouraged by dismissal, which is no 'doubt responsible for much 
of the 'good health record of the men. 

Prevention. Care should be taken to protect the workmen from 
wet by suitable aprons, rubber or wooden shoes, and wooden slats 
on which to stand above wet floors. The precautions against poison- 
ing by turpentine and naphtha consist merely in adequate ventila- 
tion, and precautions against poisoning by dyestuffs are described 
under that separate topic. 

Abrasions of the skin should be promptly disinfected, and the 
neck should be protected when carrying raw hides, and hides sus- 
pected of infection should be disinfected with formalin with steajn 
under pressure. 



FACTORY AND HAND SHOEMAKING 643 

XIH. FACTORY AND HAND SHOEMAKING 

FACTORY SHOEMAKING 

There are in the United States about 200,000 boot and shoe- 
makers, about half of whom work in factories. This industry is 
greatly subdivided, much of it being conducted by machinery. Many 
of the factories, although very large, are much overcrowded. The 
various processes involve handling of leather (which is scraped, cut 
and polished), lasting, pegging, sewing by machines, etc. Many 
females are employed. 

Hazards. The risks to health of this industry are not very 
acute, but they are numerous and some of them are incapacitating. 

In a report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health for 1907 
it is stated that, in 85 of a number of boot and shoe factories ex- 
amined, "a considerable proportion of the operatives were noticeably 
pa'le and unhealthy in appearance." (William C. Hanson.) 

The cutting, scraping, trimming and polishing of leather begets 
much organic dust (Fig. 116), which, moreover, is sometimes im- 
pregnated with dyestuffs and preservatives used in tanning. As a 
result, this dust, combined with frequent poor ventilation conditions, 
leads to irritation of the pharynx and bronchi. Sitting for long 
hours in cramped positions while operating the sewing machines leads 
to ahemia and sometimes disorders of the bladder, especially in 
women, who also acquire dysmenorrhea. The Blasters" make con- 
stant pressure over the epigastrium, which leads to various gastro- 
intestinal disorders, including visceroptosis. 

Much of the work requires strong light, and the operatives sit 
facing the glare from large windows. William Stainsby, who made 
an investigation of the heahh of 1,000 employees of shoe factories 
in New Jersey, states that many of the operatives show evidence 
of eye-strain in conjunct! val congestion, narrowed pupils, and semi- 
closing of the lids, with pain which becomes quite acute toward the 
close of the day's work and prevents them from reading or sewing in 
the evenings at home. His tabulated list of prevalent diseases shows 
that, among the 1,000 operatives reported upon, 34 suffered from 



644 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

gastrointestinal disorders, 23 from pulmonary diseases, 12 from 
irritation of the throat, and 6 from vesical disturbance. The mor- 
tality appears to have been high, amounting to 6.6 per cent. 




FIG. 116. EDGE TRIMMING OF THE SOLE OP A SHOE. "The process gives rise 
to varying amounts of dust, the finest of which in well-equipped factories is 
sucked at once into the pipe. The work requires good light, accurate eye- 
sight, considerable skill and close attention. Note the dust on the outside 
of the pipe, showing in this instance that the suction power was inadequate. 
In this industry fine leather dust is irritating to the respiratory tract, and 
naphtha fumes cause various forms of intoxication, especially in women." 
(Reproduced with permission of Dr. William C. Hanson, Massachusetts 
State Board of Health.) 

In some of the machine shoemaking processes mercury is used 
as a lubricant, and in the finishing work the sole is smoothed over 



FACTOKY AND HAND SHOEMAKING 645 

emery, sand or glass paper wheels which generate dust of leather, 
emery, glass or sand. Brass filings from rivets constitute another 
source of dust. 

All these dusts are unwholesome, and J. Beatty, of Northamp- 
ton, England, found the tuberculosis death rate per 1,000 among 
shoemakers to be 2.59, as compared with the general average of 
2.08. 



Hand shoemaking, or the ordinary cobbler's work, leads to 
marked deformity of the thorax, although the cramped position 
acquired by sitting on a* low stool and leaning forward is offset, to 
some extent, by the movements of stretching the arms in drawing 
the threads, which tend to expand the chest. 

A patient shown in my clinic who had been a cobbler for thirty 
years was round-shouldered and flat-chested, with forward curvature 
of the clavicles and depression of the lower half of the sternum, due 
to constant pressure over the last. He acquired chronic bronchitis, 
asthma and emphysema. 

Cases of tetany ("shoemaker's cramp") among shoemakers are 
described by Frankel-Hochwart. There are bilateral tonic cramps 
of the muscles, chiefly of the hands and wrists, with increased 
response to electrical and mechanical excitation. Among 399 cases 
of tetany in ^ 7 ienna he found 179 were shoemakers. 

There is often found in cobblers a fibrous swelling above the 
right knee, due to frequent hammering. Formerly tin-covered iron 
nails were used to fasten the leather "uppers" to the last, and, as 
tin contains lead, when the nails were held between the lips or in 
the mouth there was danger of lead poisoning. Injuries to the 
fingers causing abrasions or punctures may become infected and 
cellulitis result. In Vienna, in 1904, there were 357 such cases 
among 5,920 shoemakers who reported ailments to their unions. 
I saw an Italian shoemaker in New York who was obliged to 
have the forefinger of the right hand amputated from this 
cause. 



646 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



XIV. GLOVEMAKING 

This occupation is much subdivided and machinery now replaces 
many processes formerly conducted by hand. The hazards are 
neither serious nor constant, but from time to time various poison- 
ings and injuries are reported in the literature. Dr. Alfred Mode, 
in his "Health Book of Glove Manufacture," refers to chlorosis and 
tuberculosis as among the disease hazards of the industry due mainly 
to the dust, heat and poor ventilation of the workrooms. 

In the preparation of the kid or other skins part of the work 
comprises maceration, and various dyestuifs are used. Thus cases 
of chrome poisoning with perforating ulcei*te of the hand have oc- 
curred {See page 185) and for cheap grades of white gloves lead 
white or Kremsen white, which is applied to the skins, may cause 
plumbism. Alum, talcum powder, pumice powder and anilin are 
among other injurious substances sometimes handled in considerable 
quantity. The hands' of the workmen may be macerated from 
handling skins which have been freshly wet in various solutions. 
Many cases are reported of muscle and joint strains from standing 
in constrained positions at workbenches or tending machines while 
constantly doing the same kind of circumscribed work. 

Julien, of Lyon, has reported several cases of traumatic orchitis 
among workmen who pressed constantly against a workbench. Prac- 
tically all such hazards are easily avoidable and need rarely occur 
in any but the poorest regulated manufactories. 



XV. BUTTON MAKING 

The grinding of the various materials, horn, hoofs, bone, ivory, 
vegetable ivory, tortoise shell, celluloid, shell, etc., of which buttons 
frequently are made distributes clouds of dust which are scattered 
by the emery grinding wheels used for turning and polishing the 
buttons. 

In 1905 there were approximately 10,000 button makers in the 



BUTTON MAKING 647 

United States, about half of whom were employed in making fresh- 
water mussel "pearl" buttons. 

For the manufacture of the so-called pearl buttons, clam and 
mussel shells derived from the beds at the mouth of the Mississippi 
River are used to a great extent. Round discs are sawed or punched 
out of the shells, and the enveloping skin, consisting of nearly 6 per 
cent, of organic matter, is ground off on emery wheels. The dust 
from these shells consists of 93.5 per cent, of calcium carbonate. 
The buttons are then drilled, polished with chemicals and buffing 
wheels. 

Another substance much used is "vegetable ivory," which is the 
seed of the fruit of the Phytelephas macrocarpa, or "ivory nut" 
palm, growing in Colombia. This nut is close-grained, hard and 
albuminous, and is readily sawed, colored and polished. The "com- 
position" buttons are made of fossil and vegetable gums, lime car- 
bonate, mica, feldspar, amber, etc., in various mixtures. Celluloid, 
wood, casein, dried blood and potatoes are all substances which, with 
various treatment, are made to furnish material for buttons. 

Efforts have been made to reduce the dust menace in the pearl 
button industry, for the dust sometimes spreads far beyond the 
limits of the factory building, but for certain technical reasons this 
has proved difficult. 

Other buttons ground from bone also give rise to much organic 
dust which is somewhat less irritating than the mineral clam shell 
dust. The disgusting odors associated with bone button manufac- 
ture are mainly objectionable from an esthetic point of view. In a 
town in Eastern New York they were so disagreeable as to lead to 
the expulsion of a large button factory from the town. 

In the manufacture of other types of buttons much silica dust, 
which is highly irritating, is distributed in the atmosphere. 

Symptoms. Button workers acquire rhinitis, chronic bronchitis 
and conjunctivitis, and may develop fibroid phthisis. The tubercu- 
losis mortality among bone button makers is extremely high. Lud- 
wig Teleky, of Vienna, examined 150 button makers using mother- 
of-pearl and found that only 93, or less than two-thirds, possessed 
normal lungs. 



648 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

The chronic bronchitis may be of purulent type and bronchial 
hemorrhage may occur. There is also much asthma among button 
makers, and they acquire chronic conjunctivitis and blepharitis. 
Frequently the hands become fissured. Among pearl button work- 
ers thirty-one cases of a peculiar form of osteitis have been col- 
lected (Teleky). The disease begins usually in the diaphyses of the 
long bones, with pain, soreness, periosteal inflammation, thickening 
and fever. The bone presents the changes of subacute osteomyelitis. 
The disease begins in some one bone and gradually extends to others. 
It affects particularly the radius, ulnar and femur, but the humerus, 
lower jaw, metatarsal bones, clavicle and scapula have all been in- 
volved (Gussenbauer). It affects youths from 14 to 16 years of age 
whose bones are still developing. Remissions and exacerbations 
of the local pain and swelling occur. The disease may subside com- 
pletely after weeks or months, or leave some degree of permanent 
thickening. Pus formation does not appear. 

The etiology of this condition is very obscure. Gussenbauer at- 
tributes it to conchiolin, an organic substance derived from the 
mussel shells from which buttons are sometimes made, which may 
develop embolic processes in the bones. His hypothesis is that this 
dust enters the pulmonary lymphatics and is finally decomposed by 
the carbonic acid of the venous blood, which dissolves the lime and 
liberates the organic matter. In the small vessels of the epiphyses 
the conchiolin is chiefly deposited. Diagnosis is based upon the 
localization of the lesion at the end of the bone, with fusiform 
tapering of the swelling toward the center, and the favorable 
outcome of a condition which seems very serious at the onset 
(Teleky). 

The rotating wheels used in the button machinery frequently are 
controlled by a foot pedal, the workman standing upon the opposite 
foot, which often results in flat-foot. As the workman bends over 
his machine he is liable to acquire deformities, one shoulder be- 
coming higher than the other and the thoracic spine bent toward the 
depressed shoulder. 

Prevention. Prevention of the hazards of button grinding con- 
sists in the use of strong exhaust ducts applied close to the grinding

wheels to carry off the dust (Fig. 117). Moistening the materials 
used is not very practicable, for the dust is thrown off in such quanti- 
ties and so rapidly from the freshly ground surfaces that large

(Dr. William C. Hanson, Bulletin of the Massachusetts State Board of 
Health, Aug., 1910.) 

quantities of water would have to be used, which would interfere 
with the work. 

Treatment. Treatment of the periostitis and osteitis consists in 
local applications of mercurial ointment or icthyol ointment (40 per 
cent), and internal use of potassium iodid. 



650 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



XVI. CALICO PRINTING 

Calico was early made in Calicut, India, and hence the name. 
This industry occupies a number of men, women and children. In 
New York State alone over 1,600 were employed in 1908 in the 
three establishments of the State. 

Nature of the Industry. The process of calico printing involves 
the expert use of many chemicals and exposes the workers to much 
dust, moisture, excessive heat and steam. Among the chemicals used 
in considerable quantity are arsenic, antimony, chromates, copper, 
lead, quicklime, chlorin, cyanids, fuchsin, logwood, anilins, and hy- 
drochloric, sulphuric, acetic, formic, citric and tannic acids. All 
these chemicals have special uses, in part as coloring agents, in part 
as fixing agents or mordants, and in part as bleachers. 

The industry has been made the subject of an excellent special 
report in 1909 by Dr. C. T. Graham-Rogers, Medical Inspector of 
Factories of New York State, from which the following brief ac- 
count of the complex processes is mainly derived. The report does 
not deal with cases of occupational disease in the industry, but oppor- 
tunities for their origin certainly exist where factories are not care- 
fully constructed and the work well supervised as to hygienic control. 
The industry comprises printing on long strips of cotton cloth, 
dyeing, bleaching and finishing. The printing machines consist of 
large metal drums protected by a blanket cloth, against which re- 
volves a set of copper cylinders with patterns engraved upon them. 
In the working of the machines the cloth is drawn between the 
drum and the revolving cylinders, which dip into a color paste, and 
the pattern is thus laid upon the cloth. The color paste may be 
applied simultaneously with a fixing agent or the mordant may be 
first applied by dyeing the cloth, then printing over the mordant 
and bleaching out the areas not covered by the pattern. 

To prepare the rather coarse yellow cotton cloth for calico print- 
ing it is smoothed between shearing knives and brushes and then 
singed over iron tables heated by coke ovens beneath. This part of 
the process, designed to remove all loose threads and fibers, naturally 



CALICO PRINTING 651 

is extremely dusty, and, if the ovens are not well cared for, there 
may be opportunity for chronic carbon monoxid poisoning, as there 
often is where coke is used. Several washings follow, alternating 
with bleaching in vats with first potash, then chlorin solutions or 
lime, and finally dilute sulphuric acid. After drying in a hot cham- 
ber the cloth is ready for printing. 

Among the great variety of materials used for printing colors 
the anilins are most employed. They are mixed with acetic acid 
and ammonium acetate, to which arsenious acid in glycerin is added. 
Exposure to steaming liberates the acetic acid and ammonium ar- 
senate unites with the anilin. In another process which Dr. Rogers 
describes a tannate of antimony is formed instead of the arsenate. 
The blue colors are made with copper and sulphuric acid, sometimes 
with addition of anilin and potassium bichromate. The red colors 
are made from beta-naphthol with paranitranilin, and brown and 
gray shades with logwood. 

After dyeing, printing and bleaching out, with lime or acids, all 
unnecessary mordant or color-fixing agents, the goods are "finished" 
by filling with boiled starch, often stiifened with sulphate of cal- 
cium or barium ("barytes") and tinged with bluing. 

The calico is finally dried over steam heaters or revolving cylin- 
ders, smoothed, folded and packed. Rogers also refers to a process 
known as "napping," by which rollers bearing fine teeth roughen the 
surface of the calico after dyeing and printing. The dust evolved 
by thus roughening the cotton fibers is impregnated with whatever 
toxic substances have previously been applied. 

Hazards. The hazards of this industry are numerous. The 
dyeing and steaming parts of the work expose the workmen to con- 
siderable heat and much humidity, conditions which predispose to 
rheumatism, bronchitis and anemia. 

The many metals used may give rise to specific poisonings 
derived through inhaling dust after the printing process or from 
careless handling of solutions. Arsenical poisoning has been re- 
ported a number of times in this industry, and both Rogers and 
Legge, of England, have seen "chrome holes" (See page 185) on 
the hands of dyers using the chromic acid salts. Anilin poisoning 



652 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

acquired in similar manner is relatively common. It gives rise to 
gastro-intestinal and nervous symptoms, and produces an hemolysis 
which in acute cases may be fatal. (See Anilin Poisoning, page 
307.) 

The chlorin, ammonia and various acid fumes pervade certain 
of the workrooms and may cause conjunctivitis, coryza, rhinitis and 
bronchitis, besides gastro-intestinal disorders. The irritation of the 
hands and arms caused by the lime, anilins and various acids gives 
rise to dermatitis, eczema with fissures, etc. (See Diseases of the 
Skin, page 580.) 

XVII. SILK MANUFACTURE 

In silk manufacture many strong chemicals are often made use 
of, first to dissolve the gum and other impurities of the raw silk, 
then for dyeing, and sometimes the silk is dipped in a strong solu- 
tion of tin or other substance to restore the weight lost through re- 
moval of the impurities. The workmen may thus acquire various 
cutaneous lesions or other forms of poisoning from handling the 
chemicals. 

XVIII. LACE-DRESSING 

It has been asserted that this industry, owing to the variations 
in temperature and moisture, is an unhealthful occupation, but an 
investigation by Philip Boobbyer, Medical Officer of Health for Not- 
tingham, England, in 1907, of 1,002 women employed in lace-dress- 
ing and dipping shows conclusively that the work entails no risk to 
health whatever when conducted in properly ventilated rooms. 
Many women "are upset at the outset by the high temperature of 
the lace-dressing rooms and subsequently abandon the work alto- 
gether in consequence," but, on the other hand, those who remain 
soon become acclimated, so to speak, and, beyond the ordinary com- 
mon colds, suffer no inconvenience and develop no special predispo- 
sition to tuberculosis. The lace, after bleaching, and sometimes 
dyeing, is dipped in starch solution and stretched on frames to dry 



GARMENT WORKERS 653 

in rooms heated by steam or hot water pipes from T5 to 100 F. 
In Lyons some of the silk lace-dressing rooms are heated to 140 F. 
The dryest air in the Nottingham works held only 27 per cent, of 
relative humidity, and the most moist air 83 per cent. 



XIX. GARMENT WORKERS 

Under the general name of "operators" are grouped a large num- 
ber of industrial workers employed in operating machines for the 
sewing of garments, in cutting from patterns, pressing, etc. Cloak 
makers, skirt makers, and makers of men's clothing are all exposed to 
certain disease hazards affecting the respiratory and digestive sys- 
tems, and frequently also, the nervous system. 

Nature of the Hazards. Apart from the foul air, poor light 
and overcrowding which have received so much attention of late as 
notoriously connected with these occupations, there is exposure to 
dust, such as that of fine cotton and wool fibers, to illuminating gas 
which leaks from the pressing irons or charcoal ovens used for heat- 
ing them, or to leaky gas stoves used for heating the rooms. There 
are also to be reckoned with, as affecting the muscular and nervous 
systems, the effects of faulty positions of the body in leaning over 
work, the strain of the constant use of machines when operated by 
hand or foot, and the general mental strain of working under un- 
usual hurry, or "speeding up" in the rush seasons of the year. As 
in many other industries, moreover, the work is so subdivided as to 
increase monotony and multiply the number of certain movements 
without variety, thus the cutting, basting, sewing and pressing and 
finishing processes all have their potential hazards. 

The cutter piles a number of layers of cloth, one on the other, 
and places a pattern on top. The layers are then cut through 
simultaneously with sharp rotary knives or shears, operated either by 
hand or machine. The operator, in carefully following the pat- 
tern, leans closely over the cloth and necessarily inhales considerable 
light dust. In sewing the thread and cloth both evolve more or 



654 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

less dust. Investigations of the New York Labor Bureau show that 
in some clothing manufactories the dust accumulation is as high as 
in the pearl button industry. The cotton fiber dust is found to be 
worse than the woolen. 

During the assembling of the garment, if it be part of a suit, 
for example, it is sent to the presser, who employs either a hand 
gas iron or "goose," or sometimes a heavy gas iron worked both by 
hand and foot In heating these irons Bunsen burners are usually 
used, which often have leaky connecting tubing or attachments, and 
which always, besides consuming much oxygen, fill the air with 
products of incomplete combustion, and especially carbon monoxid. 
Hence the pressers especially are liable to chronic illuminating gas 
poisoning, which gives rise to headache, anemia, nausea, constipa- 
tion, and muscular debility. Moisture also is evolved from the damp 
pressing cloths. The finishing machines are frequently run by small 
gasolene engines in the workroom, which add to the general vitiation 
of the atmosphere. 

As a result of these unsanitary conditions, the operators, who 
are often also ill-fed and ill-housed at home, acquire an impaired 
condition of health in which constipation, dyspepsia, anemia and 
neurasthenia are the predominating symptoms, together with a strong 
predisposition to acquisition of pneumonia and tuberculosis. 

In the New York Health Department Tuberculosis Clinics nearly 
two per cent, of all occupations represented among the patients are 
those of garment cutters. 

Of 456 garment workers treated in the Milan Clinic, 1910-1911, 
128 presented diseases of the respiratory system (65 being tuber- 
culous), 15 had pleurisy, 16 diseases of the circulatory system, 6 
diseases of the muscles, 73 disorders of digestion, 22 diseases of the 
nervous system and 6 had nephritis. 

Dr. George M. Price, Director of the New York State Factory 
Investigating Commission, is authority for the statement that in 
New York City, "Within the last year (1911) an investigation of 
1,800 shops in the cloak and suit industry, made under my direction, 
has disclosed the fact that but 3.83 per cent of the shops had any 
special means of ventilation." 



LAUNDRESSES 655 

Women and girls who work pedal machines sometimes acquire 
dysmenorrhea. 

Prevention. Prevention consists primarily in securing good ven- 
tilation and preventing overcrowding. Food should not be per- 
mitted to be sold or eaten in the workshops, but suitable luncheon 
rooms should be provided and adequate time should be allowed for 
eating and a midday rest. 

Treatment. Treatment of the neurasthenia and digestive dis- 
orders is described under those headings (pages 531, 155). 

XX. LAUNDRESSES 

In the steam laundry business women and girls chiefly are em- 
ployed, although men are required as firemen, engineers, carriers 
and to manage some of the machinery. The old-fashioned wooden 
tub washing which involved stooping, wetting and much exercise is 
now relegated to the small hand laundries and to private families. 
The mechanically washed clothes are placed in assorted groups in 
nets and enclosed in rotating closed drums, where they are sub- 
jected to steam and hot soap suds, often under slight increase of 
pressure. The mangles and most of the ironing and starching proc- 
esses are conducted by machinery which merely requires "feeding" 
or tending without much expenditure of muscular energy. Finer 
work, as on lace and thin fabrics, must be done by hand throughout. 
Shirts, which are washed, mangled and starched by machines, have 
to be ironed by hand, owing to their shape. 

Hazards. The risks to health in steam and hand laundry work 
are the following, as the industry is at present conducted: fatigue 
from long hours of work and much standing; wetting of the feet 
and body and prolonged maceration of the hands and arms, in the 
case of hand tub washing ; fatigue from tending certain machines, as 
cuff ironers; exposure to extreme heat and humidity. Where gas 
stoves or gas irons are used the air is very often polluted by leakage 
of gas. Among 32 girls thus employed Ropke found 13 who com- 
plained of headache, vertigo and malaise. Chlorosis is common 
among the younger workers in steam laundries. Chronic rheumatism 



656 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

and tendency to acquire "colds," bronchitis and rhinitis are com- 
mon, also gastralgia and chronic constipation are among the most fre- 
quent disorders. Flat-foot is often observed, and varicose veins and 
ulcers of the leg occur in the older women. Women who use the right 
arm for continual hard scrubbing may acquire sinovitis of the 
shoulder, wrist or elbow joints. Enteroptosis may take place from 
long standing, combined with frequent bending of the body. 

As the "nets" of clothing often contain colored articles which 
might have their color dissolved and stain other clothing, very hot 
or strong soap suds cannot be used with them. Moreover, the cloth- 
ing from several families is customarily packed in one net, hence 
there arises some liability to the spread of such contagious or infec- 
tious diseases as typhoid fever, variola and scarlatina. This danger, 
however, is often considerably exaggerated, although any such process 
of promiscuous washing is emphatically to be condemned. 

Jane Seymour Klink, in a report on health conditions in laun- 
dresses in Brooklyn (Proceedings, Acad. Political Science, New 
York, Jan., 1912, vol. ii, No. 2), states that among a yearly aver- 
age of 165 women under observation for 3 years there were 1,876 
complaints at various times of illness, a high average for any harm- 
ful employment. Among these cases were 436 of gastric disorder, 
328 of dysmenorrhea, 124 common "colds," 55 cases of "sore throat," 
36 of neuralgia and 31 of rheumatism. As these were layman's 
diagnoses they are not very accurate, but show at least a preponder- 
ance of diseases arising from exposure to heat and dampness, with 
long hours of standing at hard work. 



XXI. SLAUGHTERING 

Workers in slaughter houses and packing houses have to stand 
for long hours in cold rooms. They must often lift heavy weights 
(sides of beef, etc.), and in consequence may suffer from lumbago 
and flat-foot. They are exposed to dampness as well as cold in 
winter and are prone to bronchial catarrh. The handling of sharp 
knives in rapid work often results in cuts of the hands which may 



CANNING 



657 



become infected, giving rise to cellulitis. In Germany, where women 
are employed to a considerable extent in packing houses, sausage 
works, etc. (as they are not in this country), they are liable to become 
anemic and nervous, so much so that, according to Leiser, of Berlin, 
their appearance gives rise to the local descriptive term of "Slaugh- 
ter-mamsell." 

XXII. CANNING 

This work comprises such processes as washing, skinning and 
peeling fruits and vegetables, lifting heavy crates, and working in a 




FIG. 118. SOLDERING CANS OF PRESERVED FRUIT, 12 AT ONE TIME. 

steam-laden atmosphere where the heat and temperature are often 
extreme. In some of the rooms the workmen stand on slats or wear 
rubber shoes for protection from the wet and the moist skins and 
pulp which are allowed to accumulate in dirty canneries. 

Hazards. Although the industry is not especially hazardous, it 
is by no means always free from risks. The work is of irregular 



658 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

type, dependent upon season, the hours are long, and the employees, 
who are largely women and children, often work under considerable 
tension. The women employed in the washing rooms often stand 
for hours in wet skirts and their hands constantly are immersed in 
cold water. The crates which they lift have a standard size of 
40 Ibs. The fingers of the peelers are often cut and become quite 
sore and sometimes infected. At the end of a canning season many 
of the employees find themselves unfit for other work for a con- 
siderable period. In soldering the cans there is risk of lead poison- 
ing. The cans, on a traveler, pass in front of the workman, who 
solders twelve at a time. (Fig. 118.) 

XXUI. BAKERS 

Hirt has furnished some German statistics of mortality among 
bakers and grain millers, both classes working in very dusty rooms. 
Although the dust is soft and not particularly irritating, it is very 
abundant, light and easily inhaled. 

These statistics show that more than 42 per cent, of the deaths 
among such employees arise from respiratory diseases, 20 per cent, 
being caused by pneumonia. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis and 
asthma are common, and in the United States Census returns the 
mortality from tuberculosis among bakers occupies a midway posi- 
tion among 27 industries selected for comparison. Bakers, however, 
often work by night in cellars where the ovens are placed, and, being 
below the street level, are exposed to outside dust, poor light and 
other unhygienic conditions which are really apart from their occu- 
pation per se. They sometimes sleep on empty, dusty flour sacks. 
They are exposed to high temperatures on entering large ovens and 
to inhalation of carbon dioxid developed in the course of the fermen- 
tation of the flour by yeast. The ovens, often cheaply constructed, 
may emit carbon monoxid fumes from the ill-consumed fuel. 

XXIV. MISCELLANEOUS FOODSTUFFS 

The preparation or handling of a considerable variety of food- 
stuffs may cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, although 



TEA TESTING 659 

cases of serious poisoning from these sources rarely if ever occur. 
The effects of sugar and flour manufacture have been considered 
under those headings. 

MUSTARD AND PEPPER 

The grinding of mustard and pepper exposes workmen to 
irritating dusts which cause sneezing, nasal catarrh and conjunc- 
tivitis. 

STARCH 

The manufacture of starch from potatoes, corn and other prod- 
ucts gives rise to much dust, which is not particularly irritating, 
but if any of the starch undergoes fermentation the acetic, butyric 
and lactic acids which develop may give off fumes and carbonic 
acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen gases may also be evolved in suffi- 
cient quantity to cause slight toxemia. In making starch-sugar di- 
luted sulphuric acid is used, which contributes fumes to the general 
unhealthfulness of the occupation. In making alcohol from starch 
considerable carbonic acid gas is evolved. 

VINEGAR 

In the manufacture of vinegar, especially in the bottling process, 
workmen are exposed to the slightly irritating fumes of acetic acid, 
which cause nasal catarrh. 



XXV. TEA TESTING 

One of the methods of testing the quality of tea is to sit at a 
revolving table upon which are cups of tea of different qualities. 
From these the tasters sample each variety by sipping a mouthful 
and subsequently expectorating it. Despite the expectoration, much 
strong tea is absorbed through the mouth or swallowed, with result 
of producing sometimes chronic them intoxication. 



660 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

Symptoms. The symptoms are insomnia, restlessness and general 
"nervousness," gastric catarrh, constipation, and sometimes neuritis. 



XXVI. CHOCOLATE MAKING 

The chocolate industry necessitates frequent tasting of the 
products to determine their quality. One of my patients was a man 
of 42 years who had acquired the "chocolate habit" through tasting 
the products of his manufacture. He was unduly stout, dyspeptic, 
and had a pronounced functional glycosuria, which yielded promptly 
to dietetic treatment. 



XXVII. TELEPHONE OPERATORS 

Much study has been given to the subject of the possibility of 
disorders of hearing resulting from the strained attention and buzz- 
ing of the apparatus experienced by telephone operators, and Tom- 
masi described diminution of acuteness of hearing, vertigo and dis- 
ease of the middle and internal ear among them. Such cases, how- 
ever, are rare, and probably are due to a general neurasthenic 
state rather than to sound irritation. In fact, many aurists have 
failed to confirm such observations. The only serious inconvenience 
suffered by the operators is a tendency to hysteria and neurasthenia, 
especially in young girls in whom long hours of sedentary work, 
fixed attention and nervous dread of committing errors may, in time, 
give rise to considerable nervous strain and weakness, especially 
during menstrual periods. The resulting nervous phenomena are in 
no wise different from the effects of similar strain experienced in 
other ways and are described under the headings Hysteria (page 
533) and Neurasthenia (page 528). In a few operators cases of 
nervous palpitation and vasomotor disturbances have been observed. 
(Hoche.) 

Thebault has reported several such cases occurring in Paris, and 
Wernicke in Berlin and Tommasi in Rome have commented on the 



TELEPHOXE OPERATORS 661 

great frequency of hysteria and neurasthenia in young telephone 
girls who have worked continuously for several years. 

In the United States the largest telephone company is justly 
proud of the health record of its operatives, and claims that among 
its many thousand operatives no serious cases of illness were at- 
tributable to the specific nature of the occupation. Many of the 
larger "exchanges" of this company afford models of good hygiene. 
The windows must necessarily be kept closed on account of the 
serious injury possible to the delicate apparatus from outside dust, 
but good artificial ventilation is installed. Matrons supervise the 
health of the girls and anemic and neurotic girls are excluded 
from the work, as well as those having digestive or menstrual dis- 
orders. Constipation is very common among girls and women in 
all sedentary occupations, and the treatment is described on page 
156. 

The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has found it 
an economic advantage to take excellent care of its operatives in 
order to lessen the possibility of neuroses and neurasthenia among 
them. In the larger "exchanges" rest rooms are provided, and in 
some of them there are roof gardens and calisthenic exercises are 
encouraged for relaxation. Lounges are supplied where girls may 
lie down and rest during their off-duty periods, if necessary. Much 
attention also is given to providing means for personal cleanliness, 
adequate wash-rooms, lockers, etc., and hot food and tea or coffee 
may be purchased in the separate lunch rooms for cost price. In 
the larger exchanges an emergency hospital ward is maintained for 
use by any girl who may become suddenly ill from any cause. In 
some of the rest rooms pianos, pianolas and games are supplied for 
diversion. All these things, rightly used, tend to counteract the 
fatigue and strain resulting from long hours of close mental appli- 
cation. The report of the company states that "untiring vigilance 
is given to the problem of keeping the load of work so adjusted that 
it shall result in neither the monotony of idleness nor the strain of 
over-exertion." 

More than 50,000 young women are employed throughout the 
Bell telephone system in this country. 



662 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 



XXVIII. BARBERS 

It is hardly to be expected that barbers should suffer from any 
occupational troubles other than occasional cuts of the fingers, but 
they sometimes have flat-foot from standing long hours on tiles or 
other hard flooring. They also exceptionally have eczema of the 
hands from frequent rubbing with hair dyes, oils and other applica- 
tions. Cases of barber's eczema are described upon page 581. 



XXIX. GARDENERS 

The hazards of the occupation of gardening are several, but not 
very serious, and are to a great extent offset by the advantages of 
life in the open, excepting for those who work constantly in hot- 
houses. Gardeners are subject, however, to working in wet clothing 
after rainfall and heavy dew, and may thus acquire catarrhal affec- 
tions of the upper air passages, and those who work in winter in 
damp hothouses are much exposed to chilling the body on going out 
into the cold air. Influenza, rhinitis, chronic bronchitis and rheu- 
matism are among their chief ailments. The dust of seeds and of 
fine earths used in potting plants is moderately irritating to the 
Schneiderian membrane, and nose colds or other forms of "hay- 
fever" are sometimes met with. There is a variety of large primrose 
(Primula obconica) grown under glass in Holland, and sometimes 
imported to this country, which possesses as definite toxic properties 
as the common poison ivy. It causes intense acute rhinitis and, if 
handled, develops a violent urticaria which may involve the hands, 
face, and parts of the body. Some gardeners are so sensitive to this 
and similar plants, such as Primula sinensis and P. Sieboldii, that 
they cannot work with them at all. Dr. W. B. James told me of 
a patient who purchased several of these primroses and took them 
home in her carriage. Being very fond of them, she buried her face 
in them for a few moments and shortly after developed a dermatitis 
of face and hands which caused redness, swelling and intolerable 
itching of several days' duration. 



DRIVERS 663 

Garden vegetables require much weeding, and as the plants grow 
low and in long rows the gardener must do much of the planting, 
weeding, berry-picking, etc., upon the knees. Patellar bursitis may 
develop as a result of such occupation, as well as lumbago and sci- 
atica. Richard Loth, of Erfurt, refers to the occasional occurrence 
among gardeners of tetanus, the germ of which (Bacillus mallei) 
may enter the foot from the soil by means of accidental puncture 
with a rusty nail or otherwise. Soils in certain localities are well 
known to be extensively infected with this germ. 

Septic infection of the hands may result occasionally. Excep- 
tionally cases of arsenic poisoning have occurred among gardeners 
who use arsenical preparations, either in powder or fluid form 
(Paris green, Bordeaux mixture, etc.), as insecticides, against the 
potato bug and other insects. 



XXX. BLACKSMITHS AND HORSESHOERS 

Blacksmiths and horseshoers usually work in open shops and, 
despite the deleterious gases of their furnaces which they lean over, 
do not appear to suffer from gas poisoning, as a rule, but I have 
referred under Brass Poisoning, page 175, to a case of lead palsy 
acquired in this manner. From the frequent changes in temper- 
ature to which they are subjected in winter, being overheated at 
the forge and cooling off suddenly outdoors, they are liable to fre- 
quent attacks of bronchitis and rheumatism, and are predisposed to 
nephritis. They have conjunctivitis from smoke and dust in the 
eyes, and they acquire a physiological hypertrophy of the muscles 
of the arms and thorax. Horseshoers rarely may be exposed to 
glanders. 

XXXI. DRIVERS 

Drivers of street drays, public hacks, etc., have always been 
rated in England as belonging to one of the most unhealthful occu- 
pations, their tuberculosis mortality, according to Arlidge, rating 



664 MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES 

359, as compared with 220 in other occupations. They also have 
gout and rheumatism, being exposed to cold and damp, and especially 
to the hazards of the corner grog saloon. They often work in foul 
stables and besides are exposed to much street dust. In this country 
there are (or were before taxicabs and motor trucks came into 
such general use) about a half-million drivers of this class, but the 
occupation is not rated as especially hazardous. Its evils, after all, 
are largely offset by an open-air life. Conditions vary so much 
among these men, being largely influenced by personal habits, the 
degree of sedentary work, etc., that it is difficult to generalize about 
them. 

XXXII. FIREMEN 

Firemen are exposed to the hazards of extreme heat, and also, 
in winter, to cold, and at all times to wetting, and irregular hours for 
sleeping and eating. Their chief hazard, however, is from asphyxia 
caused by inhalation of hot smoke, coal gas, illuminating gas, or the 
fumes of burning oil, turpentine, sulphur, naphtha, camphor, am- 
monia and a variety of similar highly poisonous substances which 
may have been stored in burning buildings. They are subject from 
these causes not only to immediate asphyxia and pulmonary edema, 
but to conjunctivitis, acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia. 
The condition of asphyxia is described on page 144, of pulmonary 
edema on page 154, and various types of rescue and preventive ap- 
paratus are described on pages 145 and 147.
