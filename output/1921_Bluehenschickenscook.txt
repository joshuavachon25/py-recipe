The Other Side of 

Good mil 

EVERY merchant knows thxit a successful 
business is built by making a friend of the 
customer. A disgruntled customer, or, oiie 
with a ^'chip on the shoulder'' against a store, 
can work a lot of harm to that business. Many 
such customers are a positive menace. And a 
costly liability. 

It is obvious that a merchant, then, must see to it 
that every article sold in his store carries with it a 
protection against the creation of bad feeling or 
shaken confidence in the customer's mind. The 
customer may leave the store perfectly satisfied, but 
if the goods purchased do not protect that satisfac- 
tion, the merchant is taking away, stone by stone, 
the very foundation o( his business.

Introduction 



THE PENINSULA which lies between the Delaware 
and Chesapeake Bays and is composed of the Eastern 
Shore of Maryland, Delaware, and a little bit of Vir- 
ginia, has for two hundred years been famous the world 
over for the lusciousness of its viands and the excellence of 
its cooking. 

The recipes which tickled the palates of the Colonial 
planters and their visitors, and first earned for the Penin- 
sula its fame for the highest development in the art of cook- 
ing, have descended with the family plate to the heirs of 
those old planters; nor has the art of the Colonial house- 
keeper been lost ; but rather has it been refined and adapted 
to modern conditions and cullinary appliances. 

Many of the recipes have been handed down from mo- 
ther to daughter, and to grand-daughter among the women 
of the Peninsula and are as highly prized by them as their 
family plate and Colonial furniture. These recipes were 
gathered by the ladies of The Milford New Century Club; 
and all were thoroughly tested before their approval. Only 
persons well-known for their cooking were asked to contri- 
bute. The publishers hope to perpetuate by this publication 
the housewifely lore of the Peninsula, and to share it with 
the public. 

It is with this idea that we oflfer the second edition of 
The Blue Hen's Chickens' Cook Book to the public.

TO COOK A HUSBAND 

A good many husbands are utterly spoiled by mismanagement. 
Some women go about it as if their husbands were bladders, and pro- 
ceed to blow them up. Others keep them constantly in hot water. 
Others let them freeze by carelessness and indifference. Some keep 
them in a stew by irritating ways and words. Others roast them. Some 
keep them in a pickle all their lives. It cannot be supposed that any 
husband will be tender and good, managed in this way; but they are 
really delicious when properly treated. In selecting your husband, you 
should not be guided by the silvery appearance, as in buying mackerel, 
nor by the golden tint, as if you wanted salmon. Be sure and select 
him yourself, as tastes differ. Do not go to market for him, as the 
best are always brought to your door. It is far better to have none, 
unless you will patiently learn to cook him. A preserving kettle of the 
finest porcelain is best, but if you have nothing but an earthenware 
jar, it will do, with care. See that the linen in which you wrap him 
is nicely washed and mended, with the required number of buttons 
and strings nicely sewed on. Tie him in the kettle by a strong silk 
cord, called "comfort," as the one called "duty" is apt to be weak. 
They are apt to fly out of the kettle and be burned and crusty on the 
edges, since, like crabs and lobsters, you have to cook them while 
alive. Make a clear, steady fire of love, neatness and cheerfulness. 
Set him as near this as seems to agree with him. If he sputters and 
fizzes, do not be anxious; some husbands do this till they are quite 
done. Add a little sugar, in the form of what confectioners call kisses, 
but no vinegar and pepper, on any account. A little spice improves 
them, but is must be used with judgment. Do not stick any sharp in- 
strument into him, to see if he is becoming tender. Stir him gently; 
watch the while lest he lie too flat and close to the kettle, and so 
become useless. You cannot fail to know when he is done. If thus 
treated you will find him very delicious, agreeing nicely with you and 
the children, and he will keep as long as you want, unless you be- 
come careless and set him in too cold a place.

well beaten, one-quarter cupful of corn meal or bread 
crumbs, salt and pepper to taste; teaspoonful of baking

sistency ; when done, let it come to a boil for an instant.

creamy and light add a heaping teaspoonful of flour; put 
into the chafing dish the meat and dressing; season with 
cayenne pepper and salt, and let them boil a minute or two.

The value of green food as a preservative of health can- 
not be overestimated. Nature provides her own remedies 
and many of her common vegetables are medicinal. 

For years the women of Withersfield, Conn., were fa- 
mous for their beautiful complexions, a beauty ascribed to 
the onions they ate — Withersfield being noted for its trade 
in these bulbs. 

A public benefactor is he who discovers a means of de- 
oderizing the onion. 

All green vegetables should be freshly gathered, wash- 
ed well in cold water and cooked in boiling salted water. 

Underground vegetables — potatoes, turnips, etc., 
should be cooked in unsalted water. 



POTATOES 

There are many ways of cooking white potatoes besides 
the plain, mashed potatoes: Mashed potatoes nicely heaped 
upon a baking dish and browned in the oven make an at- 
tractive dish. Boiled in their jackets; boiled whole with 
cream sauce; hashed brown potatoes; cut into small cubes, 
boiled in unsalted water until tender, drain, sprinkle over 
them a little salt, turn into a heated dish, pour over them 
two or three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dust thickly 
with finely chopped parsley; boiled whole with melted but- 
ter and parsley, etc. These are some of the many ways to 
cook them.

with any of the following recipes, accompanied sotto voce, 
by "a cold bottle and another one" — while hands are busy

Orleans molasses, one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 
one-half pint of water to the "hard boil" degree : then add 
one pint of small peanuts, and continue boiling until it

butter and let it just boil in; remove from fire and add a 
large teaspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda dissolved in a lit- 
tle water; stir into the above mixture. As soon as it be- 
gins to rise pour it upon a marble slab, or dish, and spread

the better. 



HOME - MADE HOAEHOUlfD 

This is an old-fashioned preparation for coughs, and 
that made at home will contain hoarhound, while the bought 
candy has the flavor given to it with chicory. A manufac- 
turing confectioner once told the writer that he had never 
had an ounce of the genuine hoarhound herb in his factory. 
To make this candy, first make a rather strong tea of the 
herbs and boiling water, then add one pound of granulated 
or coffee C sugar to each half pint of the tea and boil until 
it will crack when tried in cold water. Pour into shallow, 
well buttered pans, and when nearly cold, mark into squares 
or bars. One can soon tell how strong to make the tea. The 
fresh herbs are preferable, but the dried packages one gets 
at a drug store will do nicely.

of the stove where the fruit will heat slowly ; stew for about 
one-half hour after the preserves come to a boil; or until 
peaches are tender. When pierced by a fork. With a per- 
forated skimmer take the peaches from the syrup and 
spread them on a platter, while you boil the syrup until 
clear and thick, skimming often. Pack the fruit in jars, fill 
these to overflowing with the boiling liquid, and seal imme- 
diately. Stand the jars in a pan of hot water while filling 
them. 



PRESEETED STRAWBERRIES 

One quart of berries, one pound of sugar. Use only 
large, selected berries ; wash and cap them. Put in a stew- 
pan one quart of berries and one pound of granulated sugar ; 
boil for one-half hour; then fill jelly glasses and put paper 
wet in brandy on top of each glass. 



PRESERVED CHERRIES 

Stone fruit; if too much juice, pour off; put on fire; to 
every pound of fruit add one-half pound of sugar. Do not 
boil ; when scalded thoroughly put in jars air-tight. 



All preserves must be cooked slowly. 



PRESERVED QUINCES 

Pare and quarter the quinces, and if they are very 
large cut again. Put them on the stove, cover with cold 
water and let scald till they are tender enough for a straw 
to go through them. Then take them from the water, drain, 
weigh, and allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to one 
pound of fruit. Put this on back of stove till a syrup be- 
gins to thicken, then push front and let cook slowly till 
syrup is thick and fruit red in color. 



90 PRESERFES 

PRESERVED PEARS 

Preserved pears may be made the same way as the 
quinces.

each pound of fruit add one-half pound of sugar. Let stand 
over night ; in the morning place on stove and cook three or 
four hours. This makes a nice syrup. 



PRESERVED CANTALOUPE RIND 

Choose cantaloupe not quite mellow, and cut the out- 
side carefully off ; lay in a bowl, sprinkle alum over it, about 
one teaspoonful to one pound, cover it with boiling water 
and let stand all night. Take from the water, drain well, 
then scald it in ginger tea, but do not boil it, then drain 
again. To one pound of rind allow one pound of sugar and 
one-half pint of water. Boil slowly without cover (add 
sliced lemon) until fruit is clear and syrup thick. Pack the 
rinds in jars; pour over the syrup and seal. 



PRESERVED RAW PINEAPPLE 

Pare the pineapple and take out the eyes. With a sharp 
knife cut down the sides in thin slices until the heart is 
reached. Weigh the sliced fruit and put in a large earthen 
bowl, add its weight in granulated sugar, stirring the sugar 
through the fruit. Pack in air-tight cans, screw the covers 
on tight and keep in a cool dark place. The pineapple will 
keep fresh and firm a year. 



PRESERVED PLUMS

juice on alone to boil, and while it is warming divide the 
sugar into several different portions, put into shallow dishes 
and heat in the oven, stirring now and then to prevent burn- 
ing. Boil the juice just twenty minutes from the moment 
it begins fairly to boil. By this time the sugar should be 
too hot to hold your hand in it. Should it mel't around the 
edges do not be alarmed, as the burned parts will form into 
lumps in the syrup and can be taken out. Throw the sugar 
into the boiling juice, stirring rapidly all the while until 
sugar is all dissolved; when dissolved remove spoon and 
let jelly come to a boil, to make all certain, then take in- 
stantly from the fire. Have glasses heated and fill with the 
scalding liquid; 

KASPBERRT AND CURRANT JELLY

by syrup ; cook till a straw will push easily to the seed. Take 
out peaches, put in jars and cover, and so continue till all 
are done. Then cook syrup fifteen minutes longer; pour 
over peaches and seal. 



CANTALOUPE SWEET PICKLE

molasses jug and any remains of ale or cold tea; let it re- 
main with the bung open and you will soon have the best of 
vinegar.

Miscellaneous 



Dost thou wish to remove a stain, 
Or cure the colic or kindred pain? 
Or seekest knowledge to kill a skeet, 
Or raise the temperature of chilly feet? 
Hast thou ants whose death would please, 
Or hast a girl would'st like to squeeze? 
Hast thou anything would'st like to know? 
From crown of head to tip of toe? 
Then read within.

106 MISCELLANEOUS 

COLD WATER SOAP 

One quart of soft water cold, five pounds of grease, 
one pound can Banner lye, or Babbitt's, one tablespoonful 
of ammonia and one tablespoonful of borax. Dissolve lye 
in the water; when perfectly cold add the grease warm, 
strained through a coarse cloth into the lye. Stir constant- 
ly with a stick until it thickens. Pour into shoe boxes. Set 
on a board, and when cool cut it out. It will make soap in 
ten or fifteen minutes, stirring all the time. 



TO CE5IENT BEOKEN CHINA 

Beat lime into the most impalpable powder; sift it 
through fine muslin, then tie same into a thin muslin; put 
on the edge of the broken china, some white of an agg, then 
dust some lime quickly on the same and unite them exact- 
Iv. 



TO WASH CHENILLE CURTAINS 

Two ounces of ether sulphate, two ounces of borax, two 
ounces of soda, one cake of ivory soap; shave soap and let 
dissolve in warm water, then add other ingredients to sufn- 
cient warm water to wash curtains in. Do not rub on board, 
but dash up and down in water until clean. Do not wring 
them, but squeeze out of the water and lay them length- 
wise in a shady place. Then take a whisk broom and brush 
until dry. 

Do not go near the fire as ether sulphate is explosive. 



TO CLEAN OLD BRASS 

Rub with the half of a freshly cut lemon until the 
article is clean, then wash in clear water, and polish with 
a soft cloth. 



TO REMOVE GREASE FROM A WOODEN FLOOR 

Cover the spot thickly with baking soda, then pour 
boiling water on it until the grease disappears. 



MISCELLANEOUS 107 

TO RI3I0VE GRASS STAINS 

Cover the stain with molasses. Lay in the sun until 
dry; then wash in soap and water. 



TO REMOTE IROTf RUST 

Cover the stain with lemon juice and salt; lay in the 
sun. Repeat this until stain disappears. 



TO CLEAX MATTING 

Wash as seldom as possible ; but when necessary to do 
so, use salt and water. Salt prevents the matting turning 
yellow. Dry as fast as you wash and wash but a little at a 
time. 



TO WHITEN CLOTHES 

One saucer of lime, two pounds of washing soda ; put in 
a two gallon crock, and fill with boiling water, one teacupful 
to a boiler of clothes. Boil the clothes and then rub them. 



TO CLEAN LEAD PIPES 

Clean lead pipes leading from wash bowls by pouring 
down them a strong solution of potash. Dissolve in hot 
water. Do not get the mixture on hands or clothing. 



HONEY BALSAM 

Three parts of strained honey and one part glycerine 
warmed together and cooled; to one cupful of this mixture 
add four tablespoonfuls of rectified spirits, in which six 
drachms of pure lemon juice has been dissolved. This is 
excellent for removing tan. 



S03IE USES FOR VINEGAR 

Vinegar will keep the hands white and smooth, and 
prevent chapping when exposed to the cold air after wash- 
ing in hot or soapy water. Before drying the hands rub 



108 MISCELLANEOUS 

over them a teaspoonful of vinegar, and the relief will be 
very great. 

The toughest beef or chicken can be made tender and 
palatable by putting a good spoonful of cider-vinegar in the 
pot in which it is boiling, or in the juice with which it is 
basted if roasting in a pan. 

One-half pint of vinegar, one tablespoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper and one pint of boiling water 
will cure night-sweats. Mix, and let cool ; strain, and sponge 
the patient at bedtime. 

In warm weather bathe with diluted vinegar ; it is cool- 
ing, and will make the skin soft. 



SALTIJfG HAMS OR BEEF 

For one hundred pounds of beef or hams : seven pounds 
of salt, two ounces of salt-petre, one-half ounce of saleratus, 
six ounces of sugar or molasses to six gallons of water 
made into a lime. Boil, and skim ; pour on while hot. Smoke 
beef three weeks and hams eight weeks. 



TO REBIOVE MILDEW FROM CLOTH 

Put a teaspoonful of chloride of lime into a quart of 
water, strain it twice, then dip cloth in this weak solution 
and lay in the sun. 



FROSTED FEET 

Rubbing freely with essence of pepperment; also a slice 
of lemon sprinkled with salt. 



HINTS FOR THE KITCHEN 

Always keep your celery roots and dry them. They 
are good for seasoning soups and sauces. 

To obtain a drop or two of onion juice for seasoning 
cut the onion across the grain and, holding it firmly, draw 
a sharp edged spoon across the cut edge, holding the spoon 
so as to catch the juice. 

When tomatoes and milk are to be put together, as in 
a cream soup, have the tomato juice and milk of the same 



MISCELLANEOUS 109 

temperature, then beat vigorously as the tomato is added, 
little by little. 

SOAP RECIPE 

To five pounds of fat ; if skins, or, of whole grease, four 
and one-half pounds, one can of lye, one-half pound of wash- 
ing soda, a little salt (a cupful or more). 

To about fifteen pounds of fat, one and one-half gal- 
lons of water. Boil three hours. Should it not harden, you 
may have to boil again. 

HOUSEWIFELY HOTS 

Serve, with the salad, little rounds of pie-crust rolled 
very thin, fried in hot fat and sprinkled with granulated 

sugar. .„ , ,, ,, 

The white of an egg added to cream will not alter the 
flavor though increasing the quantity and will cause it to 
whip to a froth more readily. , , , , . .^ ^ 

For successful sponge cake, the flour should be silted 
four times before measured, the sugar twice and the tins 
should be lined with greased paper. , 

Southern cooks never wash waffle irons, cleaning them 
with coarse salt anl plenty of clean brown paper and putting 
them away in a fresh paper bag. . 

With a can of chicken, tongue, salmon, shrimps, mush- 
rooms, asparagus, peas, beans, sweet corn and tomatoes, 
two or three kinds of soup, a tin of dried beef, a box ot 
wafers, several glasses of jelly and a bottle of salad dress- 
ing on her "emergency" shelf, no housewife need be dis- 
mayed when unexpected company is announced. 

BURNS 

Coal oil freely used on a burn will take out the fire and 
soreness. 

CLEANING FLUID 

Three ounces white castile soap, dissolved in one quart 
of warm water (soft water), three quarts of cold water, 
three ounces of Aqua ammonia, three ounces of sulphuric 
ether, three ounces of alcohol, two ounces of glycerine.

HOW TO HATE A FAIR SKIN 



Practical Hints on the Care of the Complexion 

There is no such fresh tonic as a morning hand bath of 
cold salt water for all but those weaklings who find the ef- 
fect too severe. For an oily skin a little camphor in the 
wash basin or rubbing the face with a cloth instead of the 
hands will prove beneficial. 

Sunburn may be removed by either the white of one 
^gg and the juice of a lemon heated (not boiled) together 
for a half hour, or two cups young, fresh lettuce mashed 
and mixed with one cupful of boiling mutton tallow, left to 
boil up, then strained, perfumed, beaten till cold and packed 
for use in a covered jar. 

Moist starch or hot water will remove the discoloration 
from a bruise. 

The use of a handful of bran, tied in a cloth and dipped 
in tepid water, will help to smooth a raughened skin. A few 
drops of benzoin in a little water, rubbed over the flesh after 
a bath, imparts a delightful, violet-like odor to the body. 

For freckles use either of these mixtures : Two-thirds 
lemon juice to one-third Jamaica rum, or one ounce lemon 
juice, one and one-quarter drachms borax, one-half drachm 
of sugar, left bottled several days before using. 

The lips may be bathed with alumn water occasionally 
and then rubbed with camphor ice, or with this preparation 
if they should be chapped : One cupful of peeled and grated 
ripe cucumber stirred in one cupful of clarified boiling mut- 
ton tallow and beaten till cold; then perfumed and packed 
in a covered jar. 

Beautifiers pure and simple are the followings, to be 
used as washes : 1. The extracted milk of freshly-grated 
cocoanut. 2. One pint witch hazel and two ounces of gly- 
cerine added to one quart of boiled water and applied with 
a soft cloth. 3. Flowers jof sulphur mixed with milk, 
which is poured off after an hour or two, and rubbed on 
the face with a cloth. Steaming the face before going to 
bed is likewise recommended. It is said that the habit of 
regularly sleeping upon either side brings wrinkles about 
that eye, to prevent which it would be as well to lie on each 
side for part of the night. i 



MISCELLANEOUS 111 

Bathing the face frequently with very hot water is 
sometimes enthusiastically advised. It is certain that it 
thoroughly cleanses the skin, which otherwise is less often 
done than one cares to consider. But it may be doubted 
whether a multitude of the tiniest lines and wrinkles do not 
follow its persistent use. So cold water certainly roughens 
the face, and soap causes it to shine unduly. Perhaps the 
most reasonable alternative is the careful appliance of 
nothing except warm water, and a thorough washing once 
a day, followed by rinsing, with some good soap. This course 
cannot possibly harm ; more than possibly it may help. 



TO DESTROY MOTHS 

After cleaning and hanging clothes in the sun for a 
while, put them in a trunk or box, and sprinkle chloroform 
over them ; then close the trunk tightly. This will destroy 
moths, as well as the egg of the moth. 



USES OF TURPElfTINE 

A bottle of turpentine should be kept in every home, a 
few drops sprinkled where ants or roaches congregate will 
drive them away. Moths are killed by the odor of it. It is a 
good remedy for a burn or cut. When added to soap it will 
take out ink stains from white muslin. It takes out fresh 
paint, cleans paint brushes, whitens clothes if added to the 
water in which they are boiled. 



THE COOK BOOK 

Salt in the oven under baking tins will prevent pastry 
scorching on the bottom. 

If it is desired to keep cakes moist put them in a stone 
jar. If crisp cakes are preferred use tin as a receptacle. 

When weighing molasses sprinkle the scale well with 
flour, and then it will slip off again quite easily without 
sticking. 

The best way to mash potatoes is to rub them through 
a wire sieve. You can then be sure there are no lumps 
left. 



112 MISCELLANEOUS 

For luncheon or supper serve the bread and butter in 
the form of sandwiches. Cut the bread thin and remove 
part of the crust. Cut in strips after buttering or in rounds 
with a biscuit cutter. 

By cutting old potatoes into very small balls, allowing 
them to soak for three or four hours in cold water, then 
boiling in cold salted water and serving with cream sauce, a 
very good substitute for new potatoes is obtained. „ ,

THE MOLDING BOARD 

Much scouring and scrubbing can be avoided by the 
use of thick sheets of brown paper on the molding board 
when rolling out pastry in which a great deal of shorteviing 
has been used. "That greasy look" which the board other- 
wise takes on is very distressing to the neat housewife. 



A MIDSUMMER COMFORT 

/ ( 

Simple Little Remedy for the July Pantry-Pest 

The troublesome little red ants that appear as if by 
magic about midsummer, and take complete control of the 
pantry at the time when summer heat makes other trials 
hard to endure, may now be routed by a very "ample remedy. 
A practical housewife made the discovery by accident, and 
it has been found satisfactory in every instance in which it 
has since been tried. Simply mix five cents worth of tartar 
emtic in an equal amount of white sugar, make it quite 
moist with cold water, put into small dishes and set it on 
the shelves where the ants are troublesome. The ants will 
disappear quite as mysteriously as they came, and there 
will be no dead ones lyi'ng around on shelves and floor. Do 
not throw the mixture away, but s ewe it for further at- 
tacks, as it can easily be moistene and used again when 
you go to the pantry some warm, .loist morning and find 
sugar bowl, coo^ws and all sor^ of sweets and cereals 
swarming with/fe troublesome ttle summer pests.
