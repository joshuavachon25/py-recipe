clean it, wash well and wipe dry. Dredge it with salt and 
pepper, place the plank before a clear fire to get very hot. 
Then spread the shad open and nail it skin next the hot plank 
with tacks. Put it before the fire with the large end down. 
In a few minutes turn the board so that the other end will be 
down. To tell when it is done pierce it with a fork. If the 
flesh be flakey it is done. Spread with butter and serve on 
the plank, or draw the tacks carefully and slide the shad

SALAD DRESSING. 

That witty divine, Sydney Smith, wrote the following 
directions for a salad dressing, which those who have tried 
praise highly : 

Two boiled potatoes strained through a kitchen sieve. 

Softness and smoothness to the salad give; 

Of mordant mustard take a single spoon — 

Distrust the condiment that bites too soon ; 

Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault 

To add a double quantity of salt. 

Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 

And twice with vinegar procured from town; 

True taste requires it, and your poet begs 

The pounded yellow of two hard-boiled eggs. 

Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl. 

And, scarce suspected, animate the whole ; 

And lastly, in the favored compound toss 

A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. 

Oh, great and glorious ! Oh, herbaceous meat ! 

'T would tempt the dying anchorite to eat. 

Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul 

And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl.

pared flour, etc. In fact, this recipe, closely followed, makes 
the very finest, most healthful biscuits makable.

WHITE BREAD— SPONGE METHOD. 

(For Use in the Morning.) 

1 cake Pleishmann's yeast; IJ^ qts. lukewarm water; 

1 tablespoon salt; 4J^ qts. sifted flour. 

Dissolve the yeast in 1 qt. lukewarm water, and add to 

it 2 qts. sifted flour, or sufificient to make an ordinary sponge ; 

set aside to raise for about 2 hours to 2j4 hours. When well 

risen, add to it the pint of lukewarm water in which the salt 

has been dissolved; then add the remainder of the flour to 

piake a moderately stiff dough. Knead thoroughly and set 

g,side to raise for IJ^ to 2 hours. When light, turn out on a 

well-floured kneading board and knead thoroughly; divide 

into 4 equal parts and place in well greased baking pans. Let 

raise again for about 1 hour. When light, bake for 1 hour in 

a moderate oven. After bread is baked, remove the loaves 

from the pans and lean them against the empty pans, so as to 

cool the loaves by contact with the air on all sides. This 

recipe makes 4 large loaves. The whole process takes from 

6 to 6^ hours, and, if followed closely, will produce very 

good results.

SCOTCH SCONES. 

1 qt. flour; Sour milk or buttermilk; 

2 teaspoons cream of tartar; 2 teaspoon sugar; 

1 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

Mix dry ingredients together, adding sufficient sour 
milk or buttermilk to make a soft dough ; mix with a knife. 
Roll with a little flour (not quite as thick as for biscuits) ; cut 
with the biscuit cutter, and bake on a soapstone griddle, on 
top of stove, turning as required. Have the dough as soft as 
you can possibly handle it. These are supposed to be eaten 
warm. 

—Nettie M. Kaufman. 

WHITE BREAD— QUICK METHOD. 

2 cakes Fleishmann's yeast; 1 qt. lukewarm water; 

1 teaspoon salt; 1 tablespoon butter or lard; 

2 tablespoons sugar; 

3J^ qts. sifted flour (equal to 3 lbs. unsifted flour); 

Dissolve the yeast in half the water and in the other 
half dissolve the salt and sugar. Mix thoroughly the water 
containing the yeast, salt and sugar, then stir in gradually 

3 quarts of the flour. Now work in the lard or butter, and 
make a moderately stiff dough. Knead well for 10 or 
15 minutes; then set aside in a warm place, free from draft, to 
raise until light, which will be in from 2 to 2J^ hours. Cover 
with cloth or paper to prevent crust forming on top. When 
light, make into loaves with the hand; place in well-greased 
pans and set to raise again for 45 minutes. When light, bake 
in a hot oven for from % hour to 1 hour. The extra pint of 
flour will be needed to keep kneading board well floured when 
kneading and forming into loaves. This makes three Ij^ lb. 
loaves, The whole process takes about 4 hours. Half milk 
a;nd half water may be used instead of all water if a richer loaf 
is desired. Young housekeepers who have never done any 
baicing have been eminently successful by following this 
recipe.

FILLETS OF CHICKEN WITH FORCEMEAT. 

(An entree made from one chicken to serve eig:ht) 

By Mr. G. Schult (Heddelin) 

Steward Hotel Lincoln. 

Remove the fillets with care, to avoid separating the mignon and 
large fillets. Cut each side lengthwise into four fillets; bat each to a uni- 
forn thickness with a broad knife wet in cold water, dispose in a buttered 
agate pan, sprinkle with lemon juice, salt and pepper; cover with a butter- 
ed paper and cook about five minutes in a moderate oven , then press 
under a light weight until cold. Free the meat, taken from the first and 
second joints, of skin and sinew- To each half pound of meat add four 
ounces of panada, one ounce of butter, salt and white pepper, and pound 
in a mortar to a smooth paste, adding meanwhile two raw eggs- When 
well blended press through a sieve. Spread this to the depth of half an 
inch over the fillets, smooth the tops and edges with a knife wet in hot 
water and trim the fillets into shape if needed; put into a buttered saute 
pan, add two tablespoonf uls of sherry wine and set into the oven for about 
fifteen minutes or until firm to the touch. Dispose the fillets on a border 
of forcemeat or potato and fill the center with a ragout of button mush- 
rooms and chicken quenelles, or of peas or asparagus in a rich sauce.
