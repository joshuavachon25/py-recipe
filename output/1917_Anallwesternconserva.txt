Introductory 



Portland, Or., Aug. 31, 1917. 

Dear Friends: Of recipe books and 
columns of recipes in the newspapers 
and magazines, just now there truly 
are no end, so that I would not have 
the courage to present anything more 
along the usual lines for your atten- 
tion, but I believe we have something 
very helpful, as I know we have 
something absolutely new to present, 
in a plan for accurate pricing of all 
recipes, with other helpful ideas. 

My desire is to start a new depart- 
ment, not of scientific cooking to 
teach all women the new domestic 
science and cooking school ideas of 
cooking, valuable as these are, for 
these are now so well presented. 

"We want to present not the new sci- 
ence, but the old art, to gather and 
publish the old tried recipes of things 
that mother used to make — the es - 
sential, nourishing things that we 
older women have cooked for years 
in our own families, and that we 
know kept our husbands well and 
gave us happy and well developed 
boys and girls — and especially such 
of these as are the least expensive. 

Our cook books, and the recipes 
copied from them which are published 
in the papers, were all written for 
times of plenty, and not only are un- 
necessarily expensive ingredients 
used in them, but all things that are 
the least imperfect are rejected, leav- 
ing us with much of our war gardens 
unused. We must teach one another 
to cook economically, to utilize all 
the by-products, and with our econ- 
omy we must not sacrifice food 
values, or palatability which is es- 
sential that our families eat the food 
we cook and keep well. We all know 
that simple, plain fare, perfectly 
cooked, is what really keeps us in 
robust health, but while we have a 
general idea of what recipes are the 
cheapest, we don't know absolutely 
what any of them really cost. For 
the very first time, so far as I know, 
we are going to produce a collection 
of recipes of all kinds, whose exact 
cost per person is worked out, so 
that we may know absolutely, not 
only what each meal costs us, but 
the comparative cost of all the recipes 
we use. 

You would not want to feel that the 
ingredients of your prescription put 
up at the drugstore would ever vary 
in the slightest degree. Recipes may 
be just as exact, and it is possible to 
figure out the cost of the ingredients 
oi each recipe. I will do that now, 
at the present high prices, for the 
main items in use. We will print very 
valuable tables of all measures an] 



weights used in cooking, and later all 
common ingredients of cooking priced 
so that it will be very easy for us ail 
to get the absolute cost of each 
recipe. 

If the good housewives of the West 
will feel it their patriotic duty to help 
us, by figuring out some of their tried 
recipes that they like well enough to 
use often, and send them in to help 
other women, we will have a collec- 
tion of recipes that we will all prize 
most highly. This may be truly your 
bit, and as helpful to your country as 
anything you can do. Nothing, at any 
time, is as vital to the life of a na- 
tion as food, and we are told just, 
now by our president and Mr. Hoover 
that we women may play a very reaJ 
part in winning this awful war 
through our conservation of food. 
Some of us housewives and home- 
makers, who have brought our tra- 
ditions of thrift from barren New 
England, understand how to do this 
better than the women who have 
grown up in this warm, luxuriant 
garden land, the fertile Willamette 
valley. Now is our chance to help, 
let us all heed the call. 

I am not a newspaper writer. I 
come from my home to this work be- 
cause I sincely believe it will be a 
great and much needed benefit to all 
women. I believe I have these de- 
cided qualifications for the work: 

First — Accuracy. I can assure you 
that every figure presented to you, 
both in the tables of weights and 
measures and in the price values, will 
be absolutely correct and reliable. 
These will not be just figures copied 
from a book, but they will be worked 
out and most carefully verified by me 
before they are printed, so that you 
can rely upon them in every instance. 

Second — Originality. While it is as 
true, of recipes, as of anything else, 
that there is nothing new under the 
sun, and that the standard propor- 
tions and relations of all cooking 
were absolutely determined long ago, 
yet we are now considering these 
standards from a new angle. We are 
challenging all recipes to show their 
worth in food value, and that they 
bring the price of food inside our in- 
comes as well as that they please our 
palates, which has been the sole 
standard too long. 

No one has tried to tell us accu- 
rately what each recipe really does 
cost before. This will be original 
work for us all. I am finding out the 
exact and comparative cost of our 
fuels here now, of different kinds of 
wood, of gas and electricity. When 
we get that we will have a Bread 



Contest and be able to tell our city 
fathers, who are working' on the 
standardizing' of the price of a one- 
pound loaf of baker's bread — just 
what a first-class one-pound loaf of 
home-made bread really costs. Other 
contests will follow each week. 

We have an ideal medium through 
which to express ourselves in The 
Telegram. It reaches the great mid- 
dle class, to which most of us belong 
more exclusively than any other pa- 
per here. It has ideas and ideals. It 
is most generous in the space and 
money it is willing to contribute to 
make this work a success. 

But the real opportunity for help- 
fulness lies with you. I will get your 
amounts, classify and arrange what 
you send in, and give what I can of 



my own with yours, but I know that 
a great rich mine of experience and 
ability is lying unused for the public 
good among the real homes of this 
home city, and I call on you women 
now to unselfishly put yourselves to 
some little trouble if necessary to 
help the new housekeepers and the 
inexperienced ones who want to cook 
economically, but don't know how and 
have no place to learn, as well as to 
confer mutual benefit on each other. 
Let us respond to our president's 
appeal to us, follow the suggestions 
of Mr. Hoover, and help our beloved 
country to win this great war "to 
make the world safe for democracy." 

Yours Most Sincerely, 

AUNT PRUDENCE.

THE IDEAL COMBINA- 
TION STEAM COOKER, 
BAKER AND CANNER. 

Takes all the worry out of 
your cooking. Just think of 
placing a dozen different dinner 
dishes into the cooker at one 
time and FORGET ALL 
ABOUT IT UNTIL THE 
WHISTLE CALLS YOU— with 
perfect confidence that every 
dish will be wonderfully cooked. 

All the flavor and food value 
of the foods is saved. Vege- 
tables, fruits and meats are 
canned and all done over one 
burner of any stove, any kind 
of fuel. Foods retain their full 
weights, are canned without 
breaking up and will last for 
years and years. 

It not only cans but cooks 
full meals and the food is bet- 
ter cooked and the saving is 
tremendous. 

There is no evaporation. Foods 
weigh the same when cooked as 
before. 

The cheaper cuts of meat and 
less expensive foods are made 
as tender and delicious as the 
more expensive cuts of meat 
and the higher priced foods 
cooked by the ordinary method. 

Foods cannot scorch, dry up, 
over-cook, burn. Food may be 
kept hot and delicious for hours. 
Foods may be cooked in the 
same utensils in which they are 
to be served. 



Uncle Sam 
Says: 

"Madame, Save More Food" 

To cut out the cost of at least a ton 
of coal; to spend at least 300 hours a 
year in comfort that would otherwise 
be spent over a hot stove. 

IS THIS WORTH ANY- 
THING TO YOU? 

THE IDEAL, COOKER PRACTICALLY 
COOKS WITHOUT EIRE 

Two quarts of water brought to a 
boiling point cooks all your dinner — 
figure out what that will save you in 
the course of a year.

Fall Seeding and Harvesting 



To tell just when our vegetables 
now in the ground should be har- 
vested; what is the best way to store 
those that are not to be canned, and 
what vegetables can safely be left in 
the ground all winter here, the Ore- 
gon Agricultural College gives these 
suggestions for seeding and harvest- 
ing vegetables. As our season was 
late this year, I have gone back a 
little to August 15; this is what we 
are to do and the time to do it: 

August 15-30 — Seeding late lettuce 
for frame use and Chinese cabbage. 
Harvesting tomatoes, sweet corn, 
beans, head lettuce, cucumbers, mel- 
ons, peppers, etc. 

September 1-15 — Seeding spinach, 
fall radishes, turnips. Harvesting to- 
matoes, peppers, eggplant, sweet corn, 
celery, onions, squash, etc. 

September 15-30 — Seeding radishes 
outside, setting lettuce in frames. 
Harvesting fall cabbage, cauliflower, 
head lettuce, late sweet corn, pars- 
nips, celery, late string beans, lima 
beans, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, 
etc. 

October 1-15 — Transplanting into 
frames lettuce plants. Seeding rad- 
ishes in frames. Harvesting late corn, 
tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, fall let- 
tuce, late beans, parsnips, kale, cel- 
ery, etc., store squash, onions, pump- 
kins. 

October 15-30 — Transplant into the 
garden cabbage plants for early 
spring. Harvesting late spinach, brus- 
sels sprouts, late cabbage, cauliflow- 
er, celery, carrots, parsnips, salsify, 
head lettuce, onions, peppers, fall tur- 
nips, winter radishes. 

November 1-15 — Finish transplant- 
ing cabbage plants, also transplant 
more lettuce for early spring. Har- 
vesting late cauliflower, late cabbage, 
late lettuce, brussels sprouts, etc. 

November 15 — Harvesting frame 
lettuce, radishes, etc., and late crops 
still in the garden. 

What I write you today has been 
worked out from different sources, 
but it is all authoritative, and I have 
a good guarantee of each item. It is 
not at all for farmers, or experienced 
gardeners, but simply for the city 
people who are raising their war gar- 
den this year for the first time, and 
don't know just where to go to find 
out how to harvest their crops. There 
is no place that I have found where 
the information here given is ar- 
ranged and condensed for the prac- 
tical use of the city gardener. It is 
also possible that the experienced 
gardener may find some item here he 
didn't know. I found out a number 
of things myself in my researches. 



I notice some things here that can 
be treated differently. If you haven't 
much time to gather your crops this 
fall, many of these can safely be left 
out in the ground in this climate for 
many months — some all winter. For 
instance, kale, which makes fine win- 
ter greens, is improved in quality by 
frost. I have seen plants seven years 
old in Southern Oregon which had 
been cut often, and had grown on 
continuously. Also parsnips and sal- 
sify are improved by frost, and are 
better left out, except that all vege- 
tables left in the ground must be in 
well-drained soil, as standing in wa- 
ter ruins any of them. 

Cabbage is left in the fields in the 
country around here till late in win- 
ter, but be sure it is the late variety 
of all these you leave out. Brussels 
sprouts are more hardy than cabbage. 
Cauliflower is more tender, but it will 
stay out till frosts begin, and lettuce 
is green and ready to use till very 
late. It may be covered on frosty 
nights and kept for months. 

One thing worth trying is to leave 
the roots of cabbage and cauliflower 
in the ground, cutting off heads as 
high as possible. Often good, small, 
new heads will grow on the old stalks. 

Carrots, turnips, rutabagas, pars- 
nips and long winter beets can be left 
out and dug as wanted for use, and 
we all know how fine parsley is in 
winter. In Southern Oregon you can 
have the finest of green onions all 
winter, right out in the ground, from 
seed sown late. 

Some farmers leave their potatoes 
in the ground till spring, but it is 
very hard to find the rows to dig 
them after the vines are gene, and it 
is better to dig them by February 
anyway, as there is danger of their 
sprouting after that if they get too 
wet. 

Be sure to get squash in before 
frost, as they are very easily injured, 
and take care that the stem is not 
broken from the squash, and that the 
fruit is not bruised, or it will not 
keep well. 

Now a few suggestions in regard to 
storing the vegetables you gather. 
Put all vegetables where they will 
have some ventilation and will not 
be too warm and yet will not freeze. 
Pick over occasionally and remove all 
decaying matter, as a little of it soon 
spoils the rest. Beans should be left 
on the vines till dry. With our hot, 
dry weather many are dry now and 
must be gathered before they shell 
on the ground. Pull vines ana all and 
put where they will dry thoroughly; 
then shell by pounding in a box and

set the family at a picking over con- 
test in the evening. 

Before digging your potatoes for 
winter you must wait for the first 
fall rains to cool the ground, or they 
will shrivel. 

J. D. Mickle, Oregon food commis- 
sioner, gave me some very valuable 
advice about gathering and storing 
potatoes and other root crops. He 
said when harvesting them don't let 
them be exposed long to the wind, 
any more than to the sun, or don't 
leave them open in a basement or 
shed, where the wind can blow on 
them, as that is what gives them the 
bad taste we sometimes notice. When 



asked how people in a small city 
house with no cellar, or in a house 
with a furnace in their cellar, could 
store their potatoes on their own 
premises, he said to choose the best 
drained part of your lot (it must not 
be a place where water stands in the 
winter), and to lay out a circle on 
the ground as large as you want your 
pit to be. Then dig a trench or drain- 
age ditch around this circle, throwing 
all the dirt on the central space. 
Level it, and on this pile your pota- 
toes in a conical shape. Now cover 
this with six to eight inches of straw, 
and over that the same thickness of 
earth, and your potatoes will keep 
well. 



DRYING VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 



The papers and magazines are full 
just now of enthusiastic advice and 
elaborate recipes for the drying of 
fruits and vegetables, and conscien- 
tious housewives who are trying to 
do every "bit" that they possibly can 
do "to help win the war" are presum- 
ably laboring early and late drying 
everything in their gardens. 

But are there not local conditions 
involved that might "give us pause" 
— at least long enough to decide 
whether drying is the thing for u#. 
These bulletins from Washington are 
sent out to the whole United States, 
and each locality must decide what 
is most adapted to it. On the barren 
hills of New England dried fruit was 
esteemed a luxury. My mother con- 
tended to the day of her death that 
no pie equaled dried peach pie, but 
she never made one that I could eat, 
though she was a most excellent cook. 
In the long Alaskan winters dried or 
dessicated vegetables are a real lux- 
ury, their light weight and ease of 
transportation making them exactly 
meet the requirements of the condi- 
tions of life there. I suppose this is 
also true of the army. But here in 
the old Willamette valley, famed far 
and near for the productivity of its 
soil, its equable climate and its win- 
ters so mild that grass is green and 
many vegetables that in most other 
localities must be harvested can be 
left right out in the ground all win- 
ter here, why should we wish to dry 
our vegetables? 

One of our state bulletins from the 
O. A. C. suggests that country com- 
munities go in together and dry the 
same things for export, which would 
undoubtedly be a wise business move, 
but we are now talking about our 
own home gardens and how best to 



preserve their products for our own 
families. Of course, sometimes when 
we are too busy about other things 
some of our vegetables get ahead of 
us and dry themselves before we 
know it. The unexpected drouth and 
hot weather that struck us the last 
of June gave us all a nice crop of 
dried peas for winter soups instead 
of the delicious canned peas we had 
planned, and many of our string 
beans may "get too old" to be good 
green, but are all fine dry beans for 
winter. In these and similar cases 
we'll take what we get and be thank- 
ful. If this frightful war continues 
five or ten years we may all need 
to dry vegetables and fruits, but we 
surely can get cans of some kind this 
year. 

It might be well to try drying a few 
things this year as an experiment. 
Or a little desiccated vegetables might 
be bought at any of the large gro- 
ceries to see if our families relish 
them, remembering that the big es- 
tablishments can dry quicker and so 
preserve much more of the natural 
flavor than is possible to us. 

We are urged to kee^ «ur families 
well by supplying sufficient nourish- 
ing food, and this food must also be 
palatable or they will not eat it and 
their health will suffer. 

I suppose there is no place in the 
United States where a greater variety 
and abundance of fruits and vege- 
tables exist for more months of the 
year than right here in Western Ore- 
gon, so let us take a sober second 
thought before we feel it right for 
us to adopt the same methods of con- 
serving our food that are necessary 
in barren New England or the frozen 
North. 

AUNT PRUDENCE. 



COLD PACK CANNING. 



THE PRESERVATION OF FRUITS 



Drying is the oldest method of food 
preservation. Sun drying goes back 
of all historic records; then preserver, 
jams, etc., came to be known, and 
about 100 years ago glass cans that 
could be sealed were invented, and 



shortly after this method was ex- 
tended to the cheaper tin can. Since 
then these, with many new inventions 
and perfections, have been our most 
widely used method of preserving 
fruits and vegetables. 



HOT PACK OR OPEN KETTLE METHOD 



In canning, various methods have 
been divided under two main heads, 
the "Hot Pack" and the "Cold Pack." 
The hot pack is simply our old meth- 
od of cooking fruit or vegetables and 
putting them into the can hot. It is 
also sometimes called the "open ket- 
tle method," and when only a small 
quantity of fruit or of any vegetable 
that will keep by this method (like 
tomatoes), are to be done at one time, 
this is the best method to use, the 
most economical of labor and fuel, 
and giving excellent results, if care- 
fully done, as follows: 

(a) Fruit carefully prepared, reject- 
ing all imperfect parts. 

Note. — This does not imply using 
only perfect fruit and vegetables, as 
is usually called for in recipes. It is 
a little more work to cut away the 
rotten or hard, etc., parts, but it 
should be done this year. A half or 
quarter of an overripe peach makes 
perfectly good marmalade, if you are 
sure that the portion you use is abso- 



lutely free from rot; and all culls of 
tomatoes, that you will take the 
trouble to go over very carefully, cut- 
ting out all green, rotter or hard 
spots, and cooking the pulp thorough- 
ly, make most excellent soup stock, 
etc. 

(b) Thorough cooking, as given in 
recipes, and a little longer if fruit 
doesn't seem fully cooked. 

(c) Absolute "surgical cleanliness" 
of utensils. This means to have your 
can and tops in really boiling water, 
so that every part is fully sterilized. 
Then to dip the rubber in for a mo- 
ment with fork, etc., just before ad- 
justing it, being sure your fingers do 
not touch the inside edge in adjusting 
it, and screwing lid down tight. 

(d) Getting your fruit in the can, 
and top on as soon as possible. If 
you use a funnel, cup, spoon, etc., in 
putting the fruit in the can be sure 
each of these is sterilized in the boil- 
ing water. 



COLD PACK CANNING 



"Cold Pack" canning is putting the 
fruit and vegetables in the can cold, 
and then applying heat outside the 
can to cook. "We give a brief descrip- 
tion of this method of canning. You 
can find it given more fully in state 
and government bulletins and in ex- 
tracts from them published in many 
magazines and newspapers. This Is 
the newest approved method, though 
my first book on canning by this 
method was published in 1890, and I 
paid $10 to learn it that year. Cold 
pack canning is so called because the 
fruit or vegetables to be canned are 
put into the can cold and raw and 
cooked later in the can. The latest 
important addition to the method is 
the blanching and cold dipping. This 
process, going as it does from 212 de- 
grees Fahrenheit to 80 degrees or un- 
der, forces such a sudden change of 
temperature upon the fruit or vege- 
table that, besides setting the color, 
loosening the skin and shrinking the 



product, it kills the bacteria which 
would cause the fruit or vegetable to 
spoil. Be sure not to slight any part 
of this process. If you use hot in- 
stead of rapidly boiling water to 
blanch a vegetable, and it is not cold 
dipped at once, it may lose its color. 
If the vegetable is allowed to remain 
in the boiling water more than the 
specified time it becomes cloudy (es- 
pecially peas). Also if your vegeta- 
bles are not blanched for a long 
enough time they will shrink, so be 
sure to watch the clock. Do not put 
vegetables or fruit into the water 
until it is rapidly boiling, remove it 
as soon as the time is up, and cold 
dip immediately. 

When the cold product is packed in 
hot glass jars and boiling water 
added, still another change of temper- 
ature from cold to hot occurs, thus 
causing the destruction of harmful 
spores or bacteria, and the remainder 
of the process completes the steriliza- 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



tion and preservation of the fruit. 
Blanching- is the same as parboiling. 
It means that the product is left in 
the boiling water for a longer period 
than is indicated by scalding. For 
the time for each of our common 
vegetables or fruits see the table at 
the close of this description. This 
table is very valuable and should be 
always consulted and faithfully fol- 
lowed in using this method. 

Cold dipping means plunging imme- 
diately into enough cold water to en- 
tirely cover your product and at once 
removing the same. Most fruits 
should not be blanched, but all which 
are must be cold dipped at once. (See 
table.) All vegetables must be 
blanched and cold dipped. The can- 
ning procedure consists of five steps: 

1. Scalding or blanching, by placing 
products in a cheesecloth bag or dip- 
ping basket, plunging them into rap- 
idly boiling water sufficient to en- 
tirely cover them, and letting them 
remain from 1 to 15 minutes. (See 
table.) 

However, in the case of greens or 
green vegetables, the volatile oils and 
color are better preserved by placing 
them in a colander set over a vessel 
of boiling water and covered as tight- 
ly as possible for the required time. 

2. Immediately upon removing from 
the boiling water or steam, plunge 
into cold water of as low a tempera- 
ture as possible. Remove at once and 
drain for a few moments. In the 
meantime be sure your boiler is ready 
and the water boiling hot. 

3. Pack at once, the sooner the bet- 
ter, carefully into hot jars, taken 
from the container, where they have 
been sterilizing. In fruits, boiling hot 
syrup or hot water (see table) is then 
added. In the case of vegetables hot 
water is used and one teaspoonful of 
salt to each quart added as seasoning. 
The scalded rubbers and tops are 
then put in place, the tops closed 
lightly to allow the steam to escape, 
and the cans placed in the boiler. 
Slats, cloths, a wire bottom or wooden 
rack of some kind must have been 
fitted to the bottom of the boiler, so 
that the cans do not set directly upon 
the bottom, but the water can move 
underneath them. The water in the 
boiler should be clean and boiling 
hot before cans are put in and must 
cover tops of the jars by at least one 
inch. 

Note. — Some methods of canning 
advocate having the water come 
to within an inch or two of the top 
of the can instead of completely cov- 
ering it. If the water is to cover 



completely you must be very careful 
to have it perfectly clean, as it will 
boil in and out of your jars. You 
should scrub your boiler carefully, fill 
it with pure clean water and put 
nothing in it but metal can racks to 
hold your cans. Any wooden slats, 
etc., will discolor the water and give 
it a bad taste. Also you cannot pack 
your cold-dipped fruit into cold cans 
and put them into boiling water with- 
out their breaking. You must set 
each can, for a moment, in a pail of 
good hot water, so it will be thor- 
oughly warmed before it is set in the 
boiler of boiling water. However, 
you can put your cans into cold or 
warm water in the boiler and let it 
come to a boil over them. Fruit or 
vegetables keep perfectly processed 
in this way. 

4. The processing begins as soon as 
the water boils vigorously around the 
cans in the boiler. Watch the clock 
for the exact time. If using a wood 
or coal stove be sure the fuel does 
not get low and the water stop boil- 
ing. In any case it is only the exact 
time that the water is really boiling 
that is counted. For this see table. 

5. Sealing. When the time is up 
cans must be removed from the boil- 
er and tops tightened at once. They 
should then be set upside down to test 
for leaks. If leakage occurs the tops 
can be further tightened until com- 
pletely closed. Do not expose to 
drafts or they may break. Store in a 
dark, cool, dry place.

OTHER METHODS OF CANNING. 



OVEN CANNING 



To can with a wood fire in the oven 
leaves the top of the stove free to 
cook and preserve. To can in the 
oven such things as peaches, pears 
or small fruits, prepare fruit as you 
would to can, only place in jars cold, 
cover with cold syrup, put covers on 
part way. If economy jars are used 
put on but one clamp, and set jars 
in any large flat pan with about one 
or two inches of water in bottom. 
Set this in oven. When the oven is 
cold build your fire and let boil 40 
minutes to one hour. Berries will be 
done in 20 to 30 minutes. You do not 
need anything under your cans in the 
pan, but you must put an extra grate 
on the bottom of your oven, under the 
pan. It is best to prepare the fruit at 
night and put it in the oven, ready 
for the morning fire. 

MRS. W. W. "WILLIAMS, 

1411 Rodney Avenue. 



Our attention has been called by 
Mrs. Williams to a method of oven 
canning which is very convenient and 
economical for those using coal or 
wood for cooking, and is a great sav- 
ing of time over the cold-pack method 
for those using electricity or gas. 
This method takes the place of the 
hot-pack method, with results like 
the cold pack, as it keeps the fruits 
whole in the cans and preserves most 
of the flavor and aroma that escapes 
in the air in the open-kettle method. 
Fully described, this method is as 
follows: 

1. Have your cans sterilized in boil- 
ing water as usual. 

2. Pack the raw fruit, cut or whole, 
as compactly as possible without 
crushing it, in the cans up to the 
first rim. 



3. For sweet fruits have syrup 
made of % pound (1 cup) of sugar to 
% pint of a pint (iy 2 cups) of water, 
or 5 quarts of water to 6 pounds of 
sugar, or for very sour fruits use % 
of a pound of sugar to a pint of wa- 
ter, or 6 quarts of water to 9 pounds 
of sugar to a dozen quart jars. Let 
syrup come to a simmer and be ready 
when cans are packed. 

4. Fill jars packed with fruit with 
above hot syrup to one inch below 
the top. 

5. Place cans in racks in dripping 
pan, or if you have no racks fold 
cloth below them, not allowing cans 
to touch each other, and pour hot wa- 
ter in the dripping pan so it will be 
about one inch deep around the cans. 
Set in the oven. 

6. Cover cans with small tin cov- 
ers or a large piece of tin weighted 
down, or a piece of sheet iron, but 
not the can covers, as it may burn 
and spoil them. 

7. If the oven is moderately hot, al- 
most close the door. If hotter it 
takes less time, and in 15 to 30 min- 
utes the fruit will be done, but in any 
case leave the fruit in until the syrup 
in the jars beads on top. Mrs. Will- 
iams suggested putting the cans in 
the oven the night before, and letting 
them warm up with the fire in morn- 
ing, and this seems to be a safe and 
economical method. 

8. Take out the pan with jars from 
the oven. Have ready more of the 
syrup added before, boiling hot, and 
fill each can to overflowing with it. 
Put on sterilized rubber and screw 
down sterilized top (just out of boil- 
ing water). Test for leaks and put 
away as usual. 



OTHER METHODS OF CANNING 



To Boil Fruit in Jars. 

Make a syrup of two pints of sugar 
to one of 'water, pare and halve the 
fruit, rinse in cold water and pack 
in jars. Fill the jar with hot syrup 
until brimful. Place jars in wash 
boiler of tepid water, bring the water 
gradually to a boil and boil from 10 
to 20 minutes. — Mrs. Trustman, 1034 
Glenn avenue North, Portland. 

How to Can Fruit. 

Mrs. Finnell, 4543 Sixty-first street 
Southeast, sends the following: Take 
any kind of fruit and fill jars, such 
as plums, prunes, peaches, pears, etc. 
Fill jars with syrup one inch from 
top. Make the syrup out of water 
with 1 cup of sugar for a quart can 



of fruit. Put in steamer and steam 
for 15 minutes. Take out and fill 
cans with boiling water if not full 
and seal tight. This is excellent, as 
the fruit remains whole. 

Canning Without Heat. 

Here are some recipes that I have 
tried and found to process the fruit 
perfectly. The pineapple in cold 
syrup is the way the pineapple fruit 
used at soda fountains is preserved. 
In all cases cans, etc., should be ster- 
ilized. 

To Can in Cold Water — It is not 
generally known that a few acid 
fruits and vegetables will keep per- 
fectly canned cold. Gooseberries, 
cranberries or rhubarb may be canned 



u 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



by selecting fruit in prime condition, 
not overripe or overgreen. Place any 
one of the above in sterilized cans, 
packing as tightly as possible to the 
first screw of the jar; put on rubbers 
(leaving off lids), and submerge jars 
under water that has been boiled and 
allowed to cool. Fasten lids tightly 
under water, take out and tighten 
again if possible. Wrap jars in brown 
paper and set in a cool place. 

When using above fruit drain off 
the water and make syrup of it to 
suit the taste and put back on fruit. 
It is always best to filter the water, 
after boiling, through a piece of 
cheesecloth, before processing by this 
method. 

To Can in Cold Syrup — To can pine- 
apples, cut up pineapples in small 



slices or pieces, take 1& pounds of 
sugar to 1 pound of pineapple, and 
place in layers in a stone crock over 
night, putting in a cold, dark place. 

The next day transfer your pineap- 
ple to glass jars, and fill jars to the 
top with the juice which has drawn 
over night, and seal the jars airtight. 
Use sterilized can tops and rubbers, 
and use them hot, so they will tighten 
better, but the cans should be used 
cold, after being boiled and left to 
cool under the same water. To can 
quinces always use 1% pounds of su- 
gar to 1 pound of quince, but steep 
the sliced quinces in boiling water 
for one-half an hour, before using the 
same process as above, covering your 
crock with toweling to preserve 
aroma. AUNT PRUDENCE. 



RECIPES 



Basis of Our Canning Contests. 

Better than any prize given is the 
consciousness of being helpful to 
other women in this time of national 
crisis. Under these circumstances our 
contests will not be ordinary ones, 
based largely on palatability and ap- 
pearance, but will be almost entirely 
decided by economy, on 

1. Economy of money and mate- 
rials, especially in the use of the by- 
products of our own gardens — the 
culls, the parts of our fruits and veg- 
etables that we usually throw away. 
How have you learned to save and 
use in desirable ways these waste 
portions that must not be wasted this 
year? 

2. Economy of time. How have you 
learned to economize on time, to can 
with less work and yet be absolutely 
sure that your finished product will 
"keep?" The judges will not accept 
just your belief in this last, as you 
might have had special luck for once, 
but they must see that it is reason- 
able that your canning should keep 
by your method. 



3. Another element will be palata- 
bility, with especial reference to va- 
riety — new flavors and seasonings to 
give relish to the staple vegetables 
that we must use day after day next 
winter. 

4. If material such as oranges, pine- 
apple, nuts, etc., not grown here, is 
used in your recipes, it will discount 
the value of the recipe considerably. 

5. The time required in cooking, 
the fuel used and kind of fire, must 
be stated in all recipes, as this makes 
a difference in both cost and labor; 
other than this, we do not ask the 
cost of any ingredient. 

6. All recipes must be signed with 
the sender's name and address, as 
stated previously. This is to imply 
a personal guarantee that what she 
sends has been tested by her recently 
and that she knows it to be a reliable 
method to use. 

7. Recipes sent are not required to 
be your original discovery, but you 
are asked for newer and better meth- 
ods that are little known. 



Apples 



Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 Forty-ninth 
avenue Southeast, sends the follow- 
ing: I am sending all my pet recipes 
and hope others find them as useful 
as I have. I use a wood range for all 
my work. So keep a supply of wind- 
fall apples, which are very cheap. 1 
peel, core and cut each quarter in 
three pieces and keep the oven and 



warming closet spread full, stirring 
several times a day. In three days 
they are dry and will not take up the 
glass jars that are needed for other 
foods. I dried 40 pounds in one week 
and my fire was not going half the 
time. Prunes may be pitted and dried 
also while the following things are 
preparing on the top of the stove: 



The Associated Press — the Correct News 



CONSERVATION OF APPLES. 



Cider Apple Sauce. 

Three pounds apples pared, cored 
and quartered, 1 quart sweet cider, 
2-3 pint sugar. Put the fruit in the 
kettle with the sugar, cover with the 
cider, cook until thick and can in 
either glasses or jars. — Mrs. Crow. 

Cider Apple Sauce No. 2. 

Grandmother's favorite. Two quarts 
cider, boiled down to one quart, 1 
quart apples, the largest and best to 
be had, pared and quartered. Cook 
the apples, a few at a time, in the 
cider until they can be pierced with 
a straw. Skim out on a flat dish, 
draining back into the kettle all extra 
cider. Keep cooking in this manner 
until apples are all cooked. Place ap- 
ples in a stone jar, boil the cider 
down until like thin syrup and pour 
over the apples. This keeps well. — 
Mrs. Crow, 1153 49th avenue S. E. 

Apple Sauce for Apple Pie. 

Do not allow one apple that falls 
from the trees to go to waste, and 
use any kind of an apple. "Wash and 
remove all parts damaged. (This can 
be done in the evening.) Cover with 
cold water and let them stand over 
night. Boil the next morning with 
the breakfast fire (do not remove any 
of the water). When tender, drain 
through colander and set juice aside. 

Now put the pulp through the col- 
ander; return it to the fire and boil 
15 minutes and can for pies. If one 
wishes to add sugar and spice to taste 
before canning, well and good. 

Those who have prunes may make 
another pie mixture by taking one- 
third prunes to two-thirds apples and 
preparing as above. Use the prunes 
now, hard and unripe as they are. I 
have just finished making gallons, 
which have a lovely color. 

Take the juice that you drained off 
the apples, or the apples and prunes 
mixed, and drain through the jelly 
bag. Return it to the fire, and when 
it has boiled can in glass jars or bot- 
tles for jelly in the winter. It will 
be a bright red and makes delicious 
jellv or syrup in the winter by the 
addition of sugar as usual. — Mrs. W. 
W. Williams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 

Canned Apples With Flavor. 

When we can ordinary apples we 
know that they are tasteless and in- 
sipid, fit only for pies. But if these 
same apples are canned green they 
will retain all their flavor and taste 
like fresh apple sauce. — Mrs. W. W. 
Williams. 

Fried Apples. 

Slice either sour or sweet apples in 
slices % inch thick, fry in hot Crusto; 
when light brown on one side, turn, 



sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
serve as a vegetable. They are de- 
licious fried with sliced onion also. — 
Mrs. Williams. 

Apple Butter. 

Take nine gallons of cider, boil 
down one-third, add to the boiling ci- 
der three gallons of apples that have 
been pared and quartered; boil rap- 
idly for two hours, so as to prevent 
them from sinking; when they com- 
mence to sink stir so as to prevent 
them from burning; add sugar and 
spices to suit the taste, stir constant- 
ly until the mass is reduced to a 
thick, smooth pulp. This generally 
takes from 30 to 40 minutes. Place in 
crocks and tie cotton batting over the 
crock. — H. I. Blitz. 

Apple Jam. 
Select nice, tart and well-flavored 
apples; chop them fine, removing the 
core; to each one pound of prepared 
apples as described use one pound of 
light brown sugar. First pour over 
the sugar one gill of cold water; put 
this in a kettle on the stove, skim 
syrup clean, then put in your apples 
and scrape into this the yellow rind 
of one lemon and squeeze in tire juice 
of lemon, scrape and slice one small 
green ginger root to each pound of 
apples and boil all slowly until apples 
look clear, stirring just enough to 
prevent burning. When the jam is 
cooked sufficiently allow it to cool in 
the kettle, put into glasses or jars 
and seal as directed in jellies and 
jams. — H. I. Blitz. 

Apple Jelly Without Sugar. 

Select juicy, white-fleshed, sub-acid 
fruit, perfectly sound and mature, but 
not mellow. The snow apple is one of 
the best for this purpose. Wash well, 
slice and core, without removing the 
skins, and cook. Drain off the juice, 
and if a very clear jelly is desired 
filter it through a piece of cheese- 
cloth previously wrung out of hot wa- 
ter. Boil the juice, rapidly at first, 
but more gently as it becomes thick- 
ened, until of the desired consistency. 
The time required will vary with the 
quantity of juice, the shallowness of 
the dish in which it is boiled and the 
heat employed. One hour at least will 
be required for two quarts of juice. 
When the juice has become consid- 
erably evaporated test it frequently 
by dropping a few drops on a plate 
to cool, and when it jellies sufficient- 
ly remove at once from the fire. A 
much larger quantity of juice will be 
required for jelly prepared in this 
manner than when sugar is used, 
about two quarts of juice being re- 
quired for % pint of jelly. Such jelly, 
however, has a most delicious flavor 
and is very wholesome. It may be di- 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



luted with water for a very fine 
drink. Where so many cull apples go 
to waste as do in our fine Western 
apple orchards, where all imperfect 
apples are rejected, this recipe should 
prove, very useful. Of course, where 



you have access to an evaporator the 
juice can easily be turned into jelly 
for you in large quantities, and can 
be used as a base to make all kinds 
of jelly, as Mrs. Nat Smythe suggests 
later in her jelly making. 



Peaches 



Canned Peaches. 

Scald peaches to remove skin and 
put them in a pail of cold water un- 
til you have a sufficient number to 
can. This will keep them from turn- 
ing brown. Make your syrup by 
using one cup sugar to two cups wa- 
ter. Now have your jars ready, and 
as you cut your peaches in halves 
place them in jars. Leave two pits in 
the bottom of each can, pour over the 
syrup and place jars in boiler. Boil 
16 minutes after the water begins to 
boil, or can as directed in the oven. — ■ 
Mrs. W. W. Williams. 

Peach Preserves. 

Select fine ripe peaches, pare, halve 
and stone them; allow one pound su- 
gar to one pound fruit and put a layer 
of sugar in the kettle, then a layer of 
peaches, and so on alternately, until 
all are used. Cover and let stand 
until next morning; then bring to a 
boil quickly and let it simmer mere- 
ly until the fruit is clear and tender. 
Blanch and add four peach kernels 
for each pound of fruit. When it be- 
gins to boil, place fruit in glass jars, 
cover with syrup and seal. — Mrs. 
Williams. 

Peach Marmalade. 

Choose fine, ripe peaches, pare, 
stone and cut them up; add a very 
little water and cook in a double 
boiler until reduced to pulp; pass 
through a colander and allow % of a 
pound sugar to each pound of pulp. 
Put it on the stove and boil until it 
will jelly, or until it will drop from 
the spoon in clots. Stir it from the 
bottom with a 'wooden spoon all the 
time it is on the fire to prevent burn- 
ing. When done seal in jars. — Mrs. 
Williams. 

Peach Marmalade. 

Two quarts overripe peaches, peeled 
and cut fine, 1% quarts sugar added 
to fruit, 1 cup water. Stir and let 
stand two hours. Break six peach 
kernels, shred fine and add to fruit. 
Put over slow fire, stirring often and 
cook until clear and thick. Put in 
glasses or jars. 

Overripe plums or prunes, especially 



the silver prunes, are good made up 
this way, with the addition of the 
different combinations of spices or a 
half cup vinegar added, so the house- 
wife may have a variety of canned 
goodies with but little trouble. 

Suggestions — We are most of us fa- 
miliar with all the plain canned fruits 
and vegetables, so will not send in 
any recipes for those. The petite 
prunes may be dried in the oven and 
are a fine substitute for raisins if 
cut small. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 
Forty-ninth avenue Southeast. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches. 

Remove skins from fruit and cut in 
halves. Stick two whole cloves in 
each piece of fruit and cook until soft 
in a syrup made by boiling together, 
for 20 minutes, 2 pounds of brown su- 
gar, 1 pint vinegar and 1 ounce of 
stick cinnamon. This amount of 
syrup will serve to cook one peck of 
fruit. Seal in glass jars. — Bertha 
Blowers, Hood River, Or. 

Sweet Peach Pickles. 

Select fine peaches, not over ripe, 
and not very large; pack them in a 
jar. Take 2 quarts sugar to 1 quart 
of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful cloves and 
broken stick cinnamon (tied in a 
bag) to each quart of vinegar; boil 
it 5 minutes and pour hot over fruit. 
The next day turn it off and boil 
again, and pour hot on the peaches 
again; repeat for three days. The 
last time you boil the syrup add the 
peaches, let them come to a boil, re- 
move to jars. Boil down the syrup 
20 minutes, cover the peaches with 
the syrup and seal. — Mrs. W. W. Will- 
iams. 

Peach Jelly. 

Use one part very sour apple juice 
to two parts peach juice, and make 
like other jellies. — Mrs. Williams. 

Fried Peaches. 

Choose ripe peaches (freestone), 
cut in two, remove stone. Pry in x k- 
inch hot fat; turn when light .brown; 
remove to dish with the hollow side 
up. Snrinkle with sugar and serve. — 
Mrs. W. W. Williams. 



Pears 



Canned Pears. 



Peel pears, quarter them and place 
in jars. Cover with a syrup made 
from 1 cup sugar to 2 cups water. 



Boil in boiler or place in oven as 
directed. Pears are easily boiled in 
the open kettle and then put into jars 
and sealed. — Mrs. Williams, 1411 Rod- 
ney avenue, city. 



CONSERVATION OP PEARS. 



Canned Pears. 

Pare fruit and cook whole with 
stems left on, or they can be cut in 
halves or quarters, removing cores. A 
small piece of ginger root or lemon 
rind may be cooked with the syrup, 
which is made of 1 part sugar and 2 
parts water. Cook until fruit looks 
transparent and can be pierced easily 
with a stiff straw or a knitting nee- 
dle, and can. — Bertha Blowers, Hood 
River, Or. 

Pear Chips. 

Eight pounds of pears, cut in chips; 
6 pounds sugar, \i pound preserved 
ginger, cut fine; 4 lemons, cut fine; 
mix all and let stand 4 hours. Then 
stew until thick; if pears are juicy 
use no water. — Mrs. E. G. Compland. 
Preserved Pears. 

Take acid pears for preserving. If 
the fruit is small preserve it whole; 
if large cut in halves; peel the pears 
with a silver knife, dropping them 
into cold water as fast as they are 
peeled to prevent discoloration. When 
the fruit is all prepared weigh the 
pears and allow a pound of sugar to 
each pound of pears. Put the fruit 
over the fire with just enough water 
to cover it and boil it gently until it 
is tender enough to yield to a slight 
pressure of the fingers; meantime put 
the sugar into the preserving kettle, 
adding to each pound a pint of cold 
water, and to every five pounds of the 
sugar add the thinly pared yellow 
rind and juice of 2 lemons and 2 
ounces of green ginger root scalded 
and scraped. Boil the syrup and re- 
move all scum as it rises. When the 
pears are boiled, as directed, put them 
into the syrup and boil them until 
they look clear. When the pears are 
thoroughly penetrated with the syrup 
remove the preserving kettle from the 
fire, allow the preserves to cool and 
put them in glasses or jars as usual. 
—I. G. C. 



Pear Butter. 

Use your overripe pears for butter, 
peel and remove cores, place in pan 
with 1 cup of water as soon as they 
begin to cook. Mash when well 
boiled down to pulp, add 1 cup of 
sugar to each 3 cups of pulp; let cool 
on back of stove two hours. Stir 
with wooden spoon and do not allow 
it to burn. When very thick can. — 
Mrs. Williams. 

To Can Baked Pears. 

Place pears in baking dish, add one 
cupful sugar, cover one-third way 
with water and bake. When done, 
place in Economy jars with fork, set 
in pan of hot water, bake in oven 
for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, 
put on second clamp and set aside to 
cool. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 Forty- 
ninth avenue Southeast. 

Pickled Pears. 

Peel pears and, if large, cut in two. 
Take out core. Put four cloves in 
each piece. Have on the stove four 
cups of sugar mixed with one cup of 
water and one cup of vinegar. Put 
pears in, cook till tender and seal. — 
Mrs. C. R. Moody, 6829 Forty-sixth

Ginger Pears. 

Four pounds of green pears, V± 
pound of preserved ginger, 4 pounds 
of granulated sugar, 2 lemons. Chop 
the pears very fine, slice the ginger 
and let these boil together with the 
sugar for one hour slowly. Boil the 
lemons whole in clear water until ten- 
der, then cut up in small bits, remov- 
ing the seeds. Add to the pears and 
boil one hour longer. Pour into 
glasses and seal. 

Hard pears, which are suitable for 
no other purpose, may be used for 
this conserve. — Mrs. H. M. Morse, 451 
Ainsworth avenue. 



Cherries 



Select fresh ripe cherries, fill your 
cans to the shoulder, cover with a 
syrup made of 1 cup sugar to 3 of 
water; boil to reduce one-third and 
pour over when cold. Can in the 
oven or in the boiler as outlined in 
the directions for cold pack canning. 
Boil 20 minutes. 

To preserve cherries proceed as for 
any other preserve. — Mrs. W. W. Will- 
iams. 

Dried Cherries. 

Many seasons in Oregon I notice 
the Royal Ann and Black Republican 
cherries dry on the trees. I have 
gathered these, removed the pits, 
sprinkled a little sugar over them and 
placed them in the oven until the 



sugar melted. Then packed them into 
jars and sealed. Use these in the 
place of raisins. — Mrs. Williams. 

Crystallized Cherries. 

To one cup granulated sugar add 3 
tablespoonfuls of water. Boil to hard 
boil degree, or until a drop in water 
hardens. Pour it over a quart of fine 
ripe cherries which have been stoned. 
Move them around gently to coat 
nicely in this syrup, but do not cook. 
When almost cold dry near the fire. — 
Mrs. Williams. 

Bing cherries canned with one-third 
loganberries make a most delicious 
combination. One cup sugar to one 
quart fruit. Try them. — Mrs. Will- 
iams.

Prunes 



Prunes to Can. 

Select ripe prunes, add Y2 cup sugar 
to each quart of fruit; place them on 
the stove and bring- slowly to the 
boiling point. Then set aside or let 
stand over night. (This hardens the 
fruit and they will not fall to pieces.) 
In the morning let them come to a 
good boil, and as soon as they are 
boiling well all over the kettle they 
will be done. Do not stir them much. 
Put in cans and seal. — Mrs. Williams. 

Prune Conserve. 

Mrs. Nina Haston, 1620 Van Buren 
street, Corvallis, Or.: Six and one- 
half pounds sugar, 10 pounds prunes, 
2 pounds raisins, 3 oranges, meats 
from one pound walnuts. Put all 
fruits through food chopper. T cut 
the nuts, as I think it crushes them 
too much to grind them. Mix ingred- 
ients well and cook 20 minutes and 
seal. 

Canned Prunes — No. 2. 

Remove the prune pits, fill your 
cans to the shoulder. Cover with a 
syrup made of 1 cup of sugar to 3 
cups of water. Boil to reduce one- 
third. Place covers on, but do not 
seal. Put cans in boiler or oven as 
directed in cold pack or oven can- 
ning. 



Jelly. 



Select prunes when they are blue 
but not ripe. Cover with water and 
boil. Steam through jelly bag. Boil 
30 minutes, add sugar cup for cup and 
boil to jelly. — Mrs. Williams. 

Prune Butter. 

Select prunes for butter when they 
are ripe enough to be soft. Remove 
the pits, put through the meat grind- 
er. Place pulp in kettle and boil; you 
will have to watch and stir the pulp 
to keep it from burning. When well 
boiled down add Y 2 cup of sugar to 
each quart of pulp. Boil 20 minutes 
longer and can. People who like 
spices may add them. I never do. — 
Mrs. Williams. 

Pickled Spiced Prunes. 

Select large ripe prunes, put a clove 
into each; prepare a syrup cf 4 pounds 
of sugar to 1 quart of vinegar, add a 
stick of cinnamon and bring to a boil. 
Have the prunes in a jar and pour 
this syrup over them while it is hot. 
Pour off and reheat the syrup for 
nine mornings in succession, pouring 
back over the prunes, when the 
prunes may be placed in glass cans 
and covered with the hot syrup for 
the last time and sealed. — Mrs. Will- 
iams. 



Oranges 



Orange Marmalade. 



Eight oranges, 4 lemons, 4 pounds 
of cut sugar. Remove peel from fruit 
and cook until soft in enough water 
to cover; drain and scrape white part 
from rind with a spoon. Cut thin yel- 
low rind in strips with scissors. Di- 
vide oranges in sections, remove seeds 
and tough skin and put them into 
kettle; heat gradually to boiling 
point, add sugar gradually and 
cook very slowly one hour. Add the 
rind and cook one hour longer; then 
turn into glasses. — Bertha Blowers, 
Hood River, Or. 

Orange Marmalade. 

One grapefruit, 1 orange, 1 lemon. 



Remove core from grapefruit. Squeeze 
juice from all and run the remainder 
through food chopper. Add juice and 
three parts water and let stand 24 
hours. Boil 10 minutes and let stand 
12 hours. Then measure one part su- 
gar to one part mixture, boil slowly 
about four hours. — Mrs. Nina Haston, 
1620 Van Buren street, Corvallis. Or. 

Orange Jelly. 

Select tart oranges, press out the 
juice and mix with an equal quantity 
of juice pressed from sub-acid apples. 
Then for each pint of juice use from 
S A to 1 pound of sugar, and process 
the same as in directions for making 
other jellies. — H. I. Blitz. 



Loganberries 



Loganberry Juice for Making Red 
Rice. 

After making jelly, return the pulp 
of loganberries to the kettle, cover 
with water and boil 40 minutes. Re- 
turn to jelly bag and restrain. This 
juice can be canned and used any time 



for rice puddings or for any other 
purpose desired. — Mrs. W. W. Will- 
iams. 

To Can Loganberries. 

Can as you do any of the small 
berries, adding more sugar if desired, 
as they are tart. — Mrs. W. W. W. 



CONSERVATION OF LOGANBERRIES. 



Loganberry Jelly. 

Add a cup of. water to two* quarts 
of berries, set over the fire, and then 
mash if you have no fruit press. 
Strain through the jelly bag, add 1 
cup of sugar to 1 of juice; return to 
the fire, boil 20 minutes and turn into 
glasses. — Mrs, Williams. 

Loganberry Juice Makes Fine Drink. 

The finest of all unfermented fruit 
juices can be easily and cheaply made 
in Oregon. It is a demonstrated fact 
that practically everybody who has 
tasted well-made loganberry juice 
considers it as superior to any other 
fruit juice. 

Preparing the Juice — Anyone who is 
able to can fruit will have no trouble 
in making loganberry juice. The 
sound, ripe fruit is placed in a fruit 
press and the juice is extracted, and 
then carefully strained. A small fruit 
press may be purchased from almost 
any hardware store. One holding four 
to six quarts is a convenient size. 
Where no fruit press is used place 
the fruit with a small quantity of 
water in a vessel on the stove and 
heat gently, at the same time mash- 
ing the fruit with a large spoon to 
extract the juice. It should then be 
strained. 

To every three quarts of juice add 
one quart (by measure) of sugar. 



Place on a stove and heat gently un- 
til the juice begins to simmer. It 
should be removed from the stove at 
once and put in bottles or fruit jars 
and sealed. The bottles and jars must 
first be sterilized in boiling water — 
just before using — just as they are 
prepared in canning fruit. 

It should be stated with all empha- 
sis that the juice must not be boiled, 
as boiling destroys the peculiar, rich 
loganberry flavor. 

The juice may be used as soon as 
it becomes thoroughly cooled, or it 
may be kept for years. It should be 
served cold, just like other fruit juice. 
The juice is rather strong, so that it 
is better when diluted with about 
three parts of water to one of juice, 
just before using. 

The writer wishes to predict that 
some day the manufacture of logan- 
berry juice will be an industry of con- 
siderable importance in Western Ore- 
gon. This fruit cannot be success- 
fully grown east of the Rocky moun- 
tains, and nowhere east of the Cas- 
cade mountains does it thrive as it 
does here along the coast. Hence the 
Pacific coast will always have a mo- 
nopoly of the industry. 

Anyone desiring further informa- 
tion on this subject may obtain it by 
addressing the writer. — F. C. Reimer, 
State Experiment Station, Talent, Or. 



Raspberries 



Raspberry or Loganberry Shrub. 

The following is an old New Eng- 
land recipe for raspberry shrub, 
which is very satisfactory for logan- 
berry shrub, and which the contrib- 
utor vouches for as superior in flavor 
and keeping qualities to Professor 
Reimer's recipe. 

Put 3 quarts of fresh berries in an 
earthen bowl, pour over them 1 quart 
of nice vinegar. Let them stand 24 
hours, then strain out the liquor and 
turn it over another 3 quarts of fresh 
berries. Let this stand another 24 
hours. Again strain and press out all 
the juice, and to each pint add a 
pound of sugar, and boil 20 minutes. 
Turn into bottles and cork when cold. 
When used dilute with three parts 
water. Keep in a cool place. 



Raspberry "Vinegar. 



Put raspberries in stone jar and 
cover with vinegar; let stand six days 
covered over, but stirring occasion- 
ally; then strain through flannel, add 
sugar pint for pint, boil % hour, 
skim and bottle when cold. — Mrs. W. 
W. Williams, 14.11 Rodney avenue. 



Raspberry Shrub. 

Cover the raspberries in white wine 
vinegar for seven days, strain 
through jelly bag and to each pint of 
juice allow one pint sugar; boil 30 
minutes and bottle. Use 3 tablespoon- 
fuls of the shrub to a glass of water. 
— Mrs. W. W. Williams. 



Blackberries 



Blackberry Jelly. 



Take blackberries, wash clean and 
add a very little water. Cook until 
juice is all out of the berries. Strain 



through a cloth and add one cup of 
sugar to one of juice. Cook from 25 
to 35 minutes. Put in glasses, but do 
not cover until cold. — Bertha Blowers, 
Hood River, Or.

bark, 1 ounce cloves, 1 nutmeg. Add 
about 1 pound of loaf sugar to every 
quart of juice and cook slowly 10 or 
15 minutes. Remove from the fire 
and let cool. — Mrs. C. L. Jordan, 2638 
Tenth street, Baker, Or. 

Evergreen Blackberries. 

I have often been surprised at the 
number of people who pass by our 
native Evergreen black as a worth- 
less berry because the seeds are large. 
But if mashed and add % water, boil 
and put through a flour sieve, then 
add % cup of sugar to each cup of 
pulp and boil the same time as for 
marmalade, it is the most delicious 
sweet in your cupboard. — Mrs. Will- 
iams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 



Grapes 



Grape Jelly. 



Select your grapes before they are 
fully ripe. Add % water and place 
them over the fire. Mash as they 
begin to boil. When all are broken 
put into jelly bag and drain. Add % 
cup of sugar to 1 cup of juice. Put 
back over the fire and boil about 30 
minutes, or until the jelly comes to 
top of kettle, and looks as if it were 
about to boil over. — Mrs. W. W. Will- 
iams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 

Grape Marmalade. 

Remove the pulp from the jelly 
bag. Cover with water, stir well as 
you bring it to the boiling point. Put 



this through your flour sieve and 
add % cup of sugar to 1 cup pulp. 
Boil until it thickens well when put 
on a saucer and left to cool about 10 
minutes. — Mrs. W. W. Williams, 1411 
Rodney avenue. 

Grape Juice. 

Six pounds Concord grapes, 3 cups 
water; boil 10 minutes and strain 
through jelly bag. To each quart of 
juice add 2 cups sugar, boil 8 min- 
utes and seal. Any bottle will do, and 
corks may be had at the drug stores. 
Dip each head in melted paraffine 
after sealing. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 
Forty-ninth avenue Southeast. 



Gooseberries 



Canned Gooseberries. 

Gooseberries are delicious if canned 
green without sugar. When wanted 
for the table reduce with y 2 water 
and add sugar to taste. They can be 
made into pies, puddings and jelly as 
one wishes. If one -wishes preserves 
arid s i cup of sugar to 1 cup goose- 
berries and boil for 30 minutes. — W. 
W. Williams. 

Gooseberry Relisb. 

Pick and wash and drain 5 quarts 
gooseberries, 1 1-3 cup raisins, 1 large 
onion, peeled and ground; put in ket- 
tle, add 2 cups brown sugar, 3 table- 
spoonfuls each mustard, salt and gin- 
ger, Vi teaspoonful of cayenne pepper 
and 1 teaspoonful of tumeric. Pour 
over 1 quart of vinegar. Bring slowly 
to the boil. Let simmer 45 minutes; 



strain through coarse sieve. Seal hot 
to use on meats. — Mrs. E. G. Comp- 
land. 

Spiced Gooseberries. 

Take 5 pounds gooseberries about 
ripe, 4 pounds sugar, 2 cups vinegar, 
1 tablespoonful each cloves and cin- 
namon, % teaspoonful mace. Boil 3 
hours and put in jars. — W. W. Will- 
iams. 

Gooseberry Shrub. 

Take green gooseberries, pour on 
boiling water to cover, let stand over 
night. In the morning pour off the 
juice, heat it and pour back on the 
berries again; then strain and to each 
pint of juice add one pint of sugar; 
boil, skim and bottle. — W. W. Will- 
iams. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 



Cranberries 



Cranberry Marmalade. 

One quart large Western cranber- 
ries, boil in 1 pint of water 30 min- 
utes, add 2y z cups of sugar and con- 
tinue to boil until well done; pour 
into molds. Cook at least 24 hours 
before serving. — Mrs. W. W. Williams, 
1411 Rodney avenue. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Take 3 cups water, 1 pound raisins 
and 2 quarts cranberries; boil until 
soft enough to sift easily; pass it 
through a sieve, add 2 cups sugar and 
boil 10 minutes. Turn into mold. 
Some can be set aside to cool and not 
put through sieve. — Mrs. Williams. 

Cranberry and Sago Jelly. 

Select nice Western grown cran- 
berries and wash thoroughly; put 
them in a saucepan, cover with cold 



water, place vessel over the fire and 
stew until so tender that they will 
break as you stir them with a spoon. 
When they are all soft, squeeze 
through a jelly bag, and to a quart of 
the strained juice add % pound sugar 
and 2 ounces of sago; let it boil until 
the sago is transparent and put in 
jelly glasses. This makes a sour jelly 
to use with meats, but most people 
prefer it sweeter — at least 2 cups of 
sugar to 1 quart of juice or pulp. It 
is a good way to put the cranberries 
through the flour sifter instead of 
Straining them, as in this way you 
use the pulp as well as the juice. 
Cranberries should always be cooked 
a day or two before they are to be 
served, and if wanted for a large din- 
ner put in a pretty shaped mold. 
Then set the mold in warm water a 
moment before turning out to serve. 



Preserves, Jellies, Etc. 



Watermelon Preserves. 

After boiling the rind until trans- 
parent, drain, but leave enough water 
to keep from burning. Add 3 cups of 
sugar for a large melon, 2 lemons 
sliced thin. Cook until it forms a 
nice syrup, and seal. — Mrs. E. Berg- 
stom, 1399 Burrage street. 

Watermelon Preserves. 

Cut rind in square pieces after re- 
moving the hard shell, then weigh. 
Cover with cold water and cook slow- 
ly till tender. Let remain in the wa- 
ter until cold. To every pound of the 
melon allow 2-3 pound of sugar with 
water enough to make a syrup. Dip 
melon out of the cold water into the 
syrup and cook slowly until clear. 
Add juice and rind of lemon to taste. 
In using lemon rind, cut so thinly 
from the lemon that yellow may be 
seen on both sides of the slice. — Mrs. 
H. M. Morse, 451 Ainsworth avenue. 

Crabapple Preserve. 

Wash thoroughly small crabapples 
without removing the stems. Weigh, 
and allow an equal weight of sugar. 
To this sugar add enough water to 
make a thick syrup and stir over the 
fire until it is melted. Boil, add the 
whole crabapples and cook until the 
skin is transparent. The cooking 
must be very slow and the syrup must 
be stirred from time to time. When 
done, pack into jars, cover with the 
boiling syrup and seal. This slow 
cooking may be done in the range 
oven during the preparation of a 
meal. — Mrs. H. M. Morse, 451 Ains- 
worth avenue. 



Imitation Apricot Preserves. 

Take young carrots, wash and 
scrape them clean, cut into round 
pieces and put into a kettle with 
enough water to cover them. Let 
them simmer until perfectly soft, then 
put them through a sieve. Weigh the 
pulp, and to every pound allow one 
pound of sugar, the grated rind of one 
lemon and the strained juice of two 
lemons and six chopped bitter al- 
monds. Put the pulp into the pre- 
serving kettle with the sugar and let 
this boil for five minutes, stirring and 
skimming all the time. When cool 
add the lemon rind and juice and the 
almonds; mix well with the jam and 
put into pots. — Mrs. Nat Smythe, 443 
East Thirty-eighth street. 

Rhubarb Jam. 

Six pounds rhubarb, 2 lemons, 5 
pounds sugar, 1 pound figs. Cut rhu- 
barb in several pieces, with skin on; 
mix with sugar and let stand over 
night. In the morning cut figs and 
lemons in small pieces, add to rhu- 
barb and sugar and cook very slowly 
over a low flame four hours. — Bertha 
Blowers, Hood River, Or. 

Strawberry Marmalade or Jam. 

To 5 pounds sugar add 1 pound cur- 
rants and 6 pounds strawberries. 
Mash the currants in preserving pan 
with 1 cup of water; put it on the 
stove and boil; then add the straw- 
berries, press and rub them into an 
earthenware pan through a fine sieve. 
Let the sugar boil to the consistency

of thick molasses, add the fruit pulp 
and boil briskly with contents stir- 
ring-, for 20 minutes. Skim it and put 
into jars. — Mrs. W. W. Williams. 

Ripe Tomato Conserve. 

Four quarts ripe tomatoes, peel and 
cut out the stem ends. Scrape out 
seeds, add 3 pints sugar, the gTated 
rinds of 2 lemons, juice of 3 squeezed 
into a little water and sugar. Cook 
until fairly thick, turn into jelly 
glasses. This conserve, if served on a 
white or green dish, adds an orna- 
mental touch to the supper table and 
is fine served with meats. — Mrs. E. G. 
Compland. 

Conserve. 

One dozen pears, 1 dozen peaches, 
% dozen lemons, % dozen oranges, 2 
quarts crabapples, quartered; 1 pine- 
apple, % weight of fruit in sugar. 
Boil two hours. — Mrs. W. W. Williams. 

To Preserve Berries Without Cooking. 

Currants, strawberries, red rasp- 
berries and loganberries make most 
delicious preserves when prepared 
without cooking. Select ripe fruit, 
add sugar, pound for pound, place in 
a jar and mash well. Put it in jars 
that have been well sterilized as well 
as their covers. Set in the sun for a 
few days before putting away. — Mrs. 
W. W. Williams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 

Currant Jelly Without Cooking. 

Choose good, ripe currants. Re- 
move from stem, place in jar and 
mash. Now put them in jelly bag 
and strain, add 1 cup sugar to 1 of 
juice. Place on stove and stir while 
the sugar dissolves. As soon as it 
looks clear, pour into jelly glasses 
and allow it to stand in the sun for 
several days. Cover with melted par- 
affine. Keep in a cool, dry, dark 
closet.— Mrs. W. W. Williams, 1411 
Rodney avenue. 



Oregon Grape Jelly. 

I wonder how many Oregon house- 
keepers are using the wild Oregon 
grapes for jelly? This gives you a 
most delicious jelly that is far differ- 
ent from any jelly made from other 
fruits. Gather the Oregon grapes 
when ripe, wash and mash, strain 
through your jelly bag. Add sugar, 
cup for cup. Boil and proceed the 
same as for grape jelly. — Mrs. W. W. 
Williams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 

The Oregon "grape," so-called, 
grows only on the North Pacific 
coast and is the state flower of Ore- 
gon. It is a beautiful vinous shrubby 
plant something like the Eastern 



trailing arbutus, but the leaves, or 
fronds, of the Oregon grape are al- 
most exactly like holly leaves except 
that they are handsomer and a little 
larger usually. It grows luxuriantly 
all over the western part of Oregon 
and Washington, and is always beau- 
tiful and fine for decorations. In the 
spring its bright yellow clusters of 
little bell-shaped flowers among the 
tender green of the new leaves is very 
lovely, and in the fall these blossoms 
are succeeded by small purplish fruit 
resembling the wild Eastern grape in 
size. It is not generally known that 
they can be eaten or used in cooking, 
but Mrs. Williams gives us a tried 
recipe for using them. 

AUNT PRUDENCE. 

Elderberry and Grape Jelly. 

So many wild elderberries go to 
waste here every fall all through the 
country that I'm going to give a 
recipe for making them into a deli- 
cious jelly. Take 1-3 ripe grapes and 
2-3 ripe elderberries. Have all the 
stems out, put them in a saucepan, 
place over the fire and let them cook 
slowly until tender enough to yield 
all their juice freely*. Then put it 
into a jelly bag and let drain until all 
the juice is out. Then for each pint 
of juice add 1 pint of granulated su- 
gar. Then boil the sugar and juice 
together and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved. Continue the boiling until 
a little of the jelly cooled in a saucer 
stiffens, and when it is partly cold 
pour it into jelly molds. 

General Recipes for Jelly. 

Mrs. Nat Smythe, 443 East Thirty- 
eighth street, city, sends in the fol- 
lowing: 

Very few people realize the wide 
variety of jams and jellies that may 
be made with plain apple jelly as a 
base. A box of Gravensteins (or any 
tart apple), a little fruit juice of sev- 
eral varieties or a few drops of some 
of the essential oils and a little vege- 
table coloring, and you are prepared 
to run the whole gamut of flavors. 

I have made apple, lemon, peach, 
strawberry and orange jelly, also or- 
ange marmalade, all from the same 
box of apples. I made an apple jelly 
using Gravenstein apples cut up and 
boiled with a little water, strained 
with three cups of sugar added to 
four cups of juice To make peach 
jelly I boiled up the skins and seeds 
of some peaches I had just canned and 
added one-third peace juice to two- 
thirds apple juice. For lemon jelly I 
used the juice of one lemon to every 
four cupfuls of apple juice. When 
cool add a few drops of good lemon 



CANNING VEGETABLES AND MEATS. 



extract and a little yellow coloring'. 
Strawberry, two cups of strawberry 
juice to four cups of apple juice. The 
orange jelly was made by the addi- 
tion to every four cups of apple juice 
of the juice of one orang-e and one 
lemon with a few drops of oil of or- 
ange added, and some orange color- 
ing. Orange marmalade was made in 
the same way, only some sliced or- 
anges were added. In adding lemon 
or orange juice or any flavoring oils 
to the jelly it is better to w»it until 
the jelly is about to set, or as cool as 
possible; otherwise the heat will drive 



off the highly volatile flavoring oils. 
For yellow coloring I use tincture of 
curcuma or tumeric. It is cheap and 
absolutely harmless. For red use 
cochineal or any of the vegetable col- 
ors which may be had at any drug 
store. For orange use a mixture of 
red and yellow. 

Economical Jelly. 

I boil my plum, apple, etc., parings 
and make the juice into jelly, so noth- 
ing is lost that might be used as food. 
—Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 Forty-ninth 
avenue Southeast.

It has been said that the oven can- 
ning is not guaranteed to be sure for 
vegetables and meats, but I can all 
my vegetables and meats — everything 
except preserves, in the oven, and 
never had a can spoil in years. This 
is much easier and much more eco- 
nomical than any other method. It is 
fully described under oven canning 
for fruits. If your fruit, etc., boils 
over, and the can is not full, fill with 
hot syrup, or vegetables with boiling 
water." 

To Can Corn. 

Carefully cut corn from cob. To 
9 cups of corn use 1 cup sugar, % cup 



salt (scant), 2 cupfuls water; boil 20 
minutes ana can. This will be sure to 
keep. Many people have tried it and 
it never failed. — Mrs. Williams. 

Salt Canned Corn. 

For 9 cups of corn I use 1 cup of 
water, 1 cup of sugar and % cup of 
salt. Boil five minutes and seal. 
When opened in winter the corn 
should be soaked in cold water for 
one hour. — Bertha Blowers, Hood 
River, Or. 

To Can Corn. 

Have corn just the right age. If 
too old it will not keep well or be 
nice. Clean silk from corn with vege- 
table brush, cut from cob and scrape 
the cob lightly. Fill your jars full 
and press down so the milk will stand 
on top. Seal and place in boiler with 
wooden grate on bottom. Place jars 
on this and fill boiler with water to 
cover jars. Cover the jars with a 
heavy cloth, then the top of the boiler 
with heavy paper; then the lid. Let 
come to a boil, then keep fire very 
low and simmer Zy 2 hours, remove 
from fire and let stand In the water 
until cold. I use Economy jars. Corn 
put up in this way will keep several 
years. In preparing for table put 
corn in pan and add sugar, salt and 
butter, with a little water; simmer on 
back of range % hour; then add a 
little milk or cream. You will find 
this very nice. I can beans and peas 
the same way, only filling the jars 
with cold water with a half teaspoon- 
ful salt for each jar of beans. — Mrs. 
E. G. Compland. 

To Can Corn. 

Cut the kernels lengthwise with a 
knife, then scrape with the back of 
the knife, thus leaving the hulls upon 
the cob, fill jars with corn and a lit-

tie water to one-half inch of the top; 
see that water soaks well into bot- 
tom of jars, can and boil four hours, 
as for beans. — Mrs. Trustman. 

Corn on the Cob. 

Wash and .strip fresh ears of corn, 
pack in jars, cover with fresh cold 
water, boil five hours the same as 
beans. — Mrs. Trustman. 

To Can Peas. 

Fill the can full of peas, cover with 
fresh cold water. To each pint jar of 
peas add a teaspoonful of sugar. Can 
and boil the same as beans. — Mrs. 
Trustman. 

Corn and peas are two of the most 
difficult vegetables to keep. I have 
canned all these this summer, as well 
as pickles and other things. I would 
be glad to help any one who don't 
know the art of canning. — Mrs. Trust- 
man, 1034 Glenn avenue North. 

String Beans. 

Be sure the pods are fresh and ten- 
der, as old pods do not cook well. Cut 
pods in convenient lengths, pack jars 
full, fill to overflowing with fresh 
cold water. If screw top jars are 
used screw cover on with thumb and 
first finger. Pill a wash boiler with 
cans in this manner, then cover the 
jars with cold water, heat gradually 
to a boil, then note the time and keep 
boiling for three hours. Let the wa- 
ter cool a few moments, then tighten 
the lids. — Mrs. Trustman. 

Mrs. C. E. Banister, North Plains, 
Or., sends us the following recipe: 

Canned String Beans (Cold Pack). 

Gather and pack in jars fresh from 
vines, pack to neck (not to top). Add 
1 teaspoonful salt to every one-quart 
jar, fill to brim with cold water, put 
on caps, do not put on rubber, boil 
three hours. Two-quart jars require 
4 hours' boiling. Take from boiler 
one at a time, take off cap, fill the 
brim with boiling water, put on new 
rubber and seal. 

Canned Beans. 

Take young, tender string beans, 
break into two-inch lengths, put in 
kettle, cover with water, put in as 
much salt as you would for immedi- 
ate use, boil 20 minutes. Put in quart 
jars and put 2 tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar into the top of each quart, then 
seal. When ready to use, pour off 
juice, parboil in pure water for five 
minutes, also pour this water off, 
then prepare as desired. — Jennie C. 
Hoelzer, 199 Monroe street. 



Canned String Beans. 

Mrs. Claud C. Miller, 1137 East 
Twenty-sixth street North, Portland, 
Or., sends these: 

Here are some of my best. I am 
glad to pass them on: 

You who have string beans in your 
war gardens drying up because, per- 
haps, you are tired of string beans, 
or because there are only a few ready 
at one time so that it doesn't seem 
worth while to waste fuel cooking 
them three hours, here is a method 
worth putting in your cook book. 
Break beans in pieces, put them in 
kettle and cook on the supper fire. 
Thus you save extra fuel. Cook one 
hour or until tender. Have ready 
some boiling hot vinegar. When beans 
are tender, fill sterilized jars to al- 
most overflowing. Add 1 tablespoon- 
ful of hot vinegar and seal at once. 
I have made use of a good many 
beans this way, and have never lost 
a can. 

To Can Tomatoes in the Oven. 

Remove the skins as usual by 
plunging in boiling water for a min- 
ute and peel. Pack the jars as com- 
pactly as possible with the whole or 
sliced tomatoes up to the first screw 
of the jar, working down on all sides 
to let out the air. Fill with the syrup 
and cook in dripping pan as described 
above. Leave in 25 to 30 minutes, or 
until the syrup in the jars commences 
to bead rapidly. Then take out the 
pan and set on top of the stove; take 
out one jar at a time, fill up with 
boiling tomatoes and juice from one 
of the cans until the jar is full; see 
that the juice fully covers the toma- 
toes, and seal as usual. 

Or you can can whole tomatoes with 
their skins on, for winter salad, by 
adding tomato juice before setting 
them in the oven. This juice is made 
by stewing some tomatoes and strain- 
ing the juice, as tomatoes with skins 
on will not make sufficient juice of 
their own. Add one teaspoonful salt 
to each jar and cook in the oven as 
before. Fill up, after letting out all 
air bubbles, from one of the cans. 
Seal and put in a cool, dark place. 
The advantage of this method over 
the open-kettle method is twofold — 
first, that there is not the danger of 
letting the fruit lose its shape and 
get mushy by overcooking or by drop- 
ping in the can while soft, and that 
more of the flavor is preserved; and, 
second, it is so much easier to pack 
fruit cold than hot; it is out of the 
way from the top of the stove when

you are cooking- other things, and it 
is in no danger of burning on if not 
watched constantly. — J. G. C. 

To Can Tomatoes. 

Scald tomatoes and peel. Put in 
kettle or dishpan and cook until 
heated through. Do not add any salt. 
Put in jars and seal. — Mrs. C. R. 
Moody, 6829 Forty-sixth avenue S. E. 



Aunt Prudence's Tomatoes. 

Did you ever can tomatoes in big- 
mouthed bottles and earthen jugs, 
and have you thought that the coffee 
cans and cottolene pails, etc., with the 
inside cover that fits down in, are 
fine to can in? I have used these 
many times and know tomatoes, etc., 
will keep perfectly in them if put up 
right. Sterilize your can and top, as 
in using glass can, put in tomatoes 
boiling hot; put down cover, wipe off 
any moisture around top and seal at 
once by dropping melted red sealing 
wax around the crevice. (This is not, 
of course, the expensive sealing wax 
used in sealing letters, but a cheaper 
coarse kind, which comes in a large 
bar.) You can melt the wax in an old 
tin and put on with a wooden stick. 
When cooled enough press the sealing 
wax down carefully all around, add- 
ing more if necessary, and being care- 
ful to see that every point where the 
air could get in is covered, and the 
contents will keep for years — just as 
they do in the tin cans you buy. 

Also you can can tomatoes in jugs 
or large-mouthed bottles in the same 
way, if you cook them slowly to a 
pulp. It is a fine way to strain out 
the seeds of part and bottle this clear 
pulp for soups or meat sauces. When 
you have filled your jugs or bottles 
put sealing wax around the corks. I 
see the government recommends using 
putty instead of sealing wax. I never 
tried this, but it would be much easier 
to handle. Paraffine is also recom- 
mended. 

But whether you can your tomatoes 
this way or not, I want to urge you 
to fill all your bottles of all kinds 
with tomato catchup, canned in just 
the same way as given above. It is 
easy to make, except that it requires 
two hours of attention and frequent 
stirring, and it is 30 much better and 
purer than that you buy. It also 
costs but a small fraction of what the 
ready bottled catchup does, and, above 
all, the canned catchup is one of the 
things our government sends to the 
soldiers, and we should let them have 
it all and make our own at home. 

Here is my recipe, which I know 
will keep: 



Tomato Catchup. 

One peck ripe tomatoes, cut fine 
and boiled iy 2 hours, stirred often to 
prevent burning. 

Three quarts onions, sliced. 

Three red peppers, sliced. 

Two pounds brown sugar. 

Half cupful of salt. 

Half tablespoonful cinnamon. 

One teaspoonful ground mustard. 

One quart vinegar. 

Stir and boil all together half hour. 
Strain. Pour in clean, sterilized bot- 
tles and seal as above. 

Some use just the reddest tomatoes 
and no other vegetables, and use very 
little spice, as this darkens it and 
changes the color. You can try it dif- 
ferent ways till you find how your 
family likes it best. 

The tomatoes, sugar, salt and vine- 
gar, in the proportions given, are all 
that is essential, and sugar can be 
varied. Celery tops can be added, if 
desired, and strained out before can- 
ning. If I have all my booties full 
and want to make more I can in glass 
jars, etc., and then open these up, 
when I get my bottles all empty in 
winter, and re-can. It doesn't take 
long. I do the same with my toma- 
toes in jugs, opening a three-gallon 
jug after I have plenty of empty cans 
on hand, and canning up .12 cans of 
tomatoes from it, or as many as I 
don't use. 

Canning Tomatoes in Small Quantities 

The following recipe was sent by 
Mrs. Lulu M. Welch, 1351 East Lincoln 
street, city, which she finds useful, 
as the tomatoes in her garden ripen 
slowly on her vines: 

For 1 quart. 

One-half 5-pound lard pail of toma- 
toes, scalded and peeled. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 cupful water. 

Put salt in water; when boiling add 
tomatoes and boil four minutes in 
covered stew kettle, then put in hot 
sterilized jar and seal tightly. For 
one pint use one-half quantity and 
proceed as for one quart. 

Canned Tomatoes. 

Bertha Blowers, Hood River, Or., 
sends us her favorite recipes. We ap- 
preciate the interest of our distant 
friends. 

Pour boiling water over ripe toma- 
toes and remove skins; cut in pieces, 
put in kettle and cook slowly without 
the addition of water until thorough- 
ly scalded. Fill jars and seal. 

Tomatoes for Soup. 

Use overripe tomatoes, wash, wipe 
and slice, add one cup hot water to

two quarts tomatoes, place on fire 
and boil 20 minutes, remove and put 
through flour sieve, boil 20 minutes 
more and can or bottle; season when 
used. — Mrs. Williams. 

No. 1 — To Can Beets. 

Now is the time to examine your 
beet bed. If the beets have hard 
black spots they should be canned, for 
if they are not you will lose your 
beets. 

To can, wash beets, but do not cut 
off anything but the leaves. Boil 1% 
hours or until tender. Pour off the 
boiling water, dip your hands into 
cold water, take each beet, dip it into 
cold water and slip it from its skin, 
cut out any bad spots and place at 
once into sterilized glass jar. When 
all have been placed in jars, cover 
with the following: To 1 quart wa- 
ter add 1 cup sugar, % cup salt and 1 
cup vinegar. Have this boiling and 
pour over hot beets and seal. — Mrs. 
Williams. 



No. 2 — To Can Beets. 

If beets are to be used for hot salad 
or fried in butter they are better if 
canned without vinegar. Fill jars as 
directed for No. 1 and put 1 table- 
spoonful sugar, 1 teaspoonful salt into 
each quart can, fill with hot water. 
Place jars in kettle of hot water, boil 
30 minutes and seal. 

Those who are fond of parsley bet- 
ter dry enough for winter's seasoning 
now. After the first frost hits flavor 
is lost. To dry: Put leaves on plate 
in the warming oven. When dry put 
away in a paper bag. — Mrs. Williams. 

Canning Pumpkin. 

Scrape out the seeds after cutting it 
up, and bake it until tender, without 
paring. When baked remove rind, 
mash with the potato masher in iron 
kettle if you have one (over the fire). 
When well browned fill sterilized 
cans while hot. Add no seasoning un- 
til opened for use. — Mrs. Williams. 



Canned Meats 



For general directions for canning 
all meat and fish, with table of time 
for scalding and for boiling in cans, 
see the Time Table for Cold Pack 
Canning of "Vegetables and Meats, 
given at the beginning of our work 
on vegetable canning. 

Also see general directions for Cut- 
ting Up and Preserving Beef and 
Pork, under the general heading of 
Meats farther over in the book. 



Canning Meat. 

When cooking fruits, if I have not 
enough jars to fill the boiler, T buy 
a piece of boiling beef or any pre- 
ferred meat, cut up in small pieces, 
roll in flour, fry brown all over, cover 
with water, add salt, pepper, a very 
little allspice, a chopped onion and a 
large tomato. Simmer one hour, can 
and boil as fruit. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 
1153 Forty-ninth avenue S. E. 



To Can Salmon. 

Wash, wipe, cut into pieces and fill 
jars, pack in tight. Put 1 teaspoonful 
salt to each quart can, add water to 
fill can, or olive oil. Put one clamp 
on Economy jars and cook in the 
boiler, or place jars in pan of water 
in cold oven, build fire and boil in 
cans 2% hours. — Mrs. W. W. Williams, 
1411 Rodney avenue. 



Spiced Salmon, Pickled. 

Boil your salmon and, after wiping 
it dry, set it to cool; take off the wa- 
ter in which it has boiled and good 
vinegar, each equal parts, enough to 
cover it; for each fish add 1 dozen 
whole cloves, 1 dozen small blades of 
mace (or sliced nutmeg), one tea- 
spoonful of whole pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of allspice. Heat boiling hot, 
skim it clear, add butter the size of 
a small egg, and pour all over the 
fish in a crock. When cold it is fit 
for use, but will keep a long time, 
covered close, in a cool place. Other 
fish may be pickled in the same man- 
ner. — I. G. C. 

Dried or Smoked Salmon. 

Cut your fish down the back, take 
out the entrails and roe, scale it, wipe 
with damp cloth till clean (but do not 
wash). Rub outside and in with com- 
mon salt and hang it to drain for 24 
hours. One pound and three ounces 
saltpeter, 2 ounces salt, 2 ounces 
brown sugar; mix these well together 
and rub every part of the salmon over 
with it; then lay it on a large dish 
(or plank) for two days. Then rub 
it over with common salt and in 24 
hours it will be fit to dry. Wipe it 
well, stretch it open with two sticks 
and hang in a chimney or in the 
smokehouse when smoking meat, or 
in a cool, dry place to dry. Other 
fish may be done the same way. — I. 
G. C. 



PICKLES AND RELISHES. 



Pickles and Relishes 



Mixed Pickles. 

Here are two recipes: The first 
one I have made, and it is very good. 
Of course, the particular kind of veg- 
etables you use in either one of these 
is not essential. Use the required 
quantity, .but put in any vegetables 
you like, or happen to have, and want 
to preserve before the frost catches 
them. However, I would buy the on- 
ions if I didn't have them. You can 
use the large onions cut, of course, 
either thick slices or quarters, as you 
like. The difference between these 
and the "little pickling onions" is in 
the looks. 

Mixed Mustard Pickles. 

3 quarts cauliflower, broken in 
pieces. 

3 quarts small onions. 

3 quarts small cucumbers. 

3 quarts sweet green or red pep- 
pers. 

3 quarts small green tomatoes, 
sliced. 

iy 2 quarts string beans. 

Sprinkle two cupfuls of salt over 
all and let stand over night. In the 
morning drain, cover with the paste 
(given below) and bring to a boil, but 
do not cook. 

Paste for Mustard Pickles. 

3 quarts vinegar. 

IVz cups flour. 

4% cups sugar. 

3 tablespoonfuls tumeric. 

15 tablespoonfuls, or a scant cup 
mustard. 

6 tablespoonfuls butter. 

Heat vinegar and sugar to a boil. 
Rub the flour, tumeric and mustard to 
a smooth paste with cold water. Add 
butter and stir into vinegar. Pour 
dressing through sieve over mixed 
pickles and let come to a boil, and put 
in crocks or cans. This makes 2% 
gallons as above. — Given me by Mrs. 
C. D. Woolverton, Gold Hill, Or. 

French Chow-Chow. 

Here is a recipe from Jane Shum- 
way, a noted cook, which has less 
than half the amount of vegetables 
given above, more than half the vine- 
gar and flour, no fat, less than half 
the sugar and about one-third the 
tumeric and mustard. You can judge 
for yourself which combination you 
like best, but the butter should be 
omitted in any case now, and, as 
mentioned, use any vegetables you 
wish: 

1 quart tiny green cucumbers. 

1 quart large green cucumbers. 



1 pint of green tomatoes. 
Yz head of cabbage. 

3 pints fine White Button onions. 

2 heads of cauliflower. 
2 small red peppers. 

2 stalks celery. 

6 T mustard. 

2 quarts vinegar. 

1 T tumeric. 

1 c flour. 

1 t celery seed. 

1 t yellow mustard seed. 

1 t curry powder. 
Vz t mixed spices. 

2 c brown sugar. 

The tiny cucumbers should not be 
over two inches in length. Cut the 
large cucumbers into slices; also cut 
the tomatoes, onions, peppers, celery 
and cabbage; divide the cauliflower 
into small flowerets. Do not chop the 
vegetables, but cut them into bits 
about the size of walnuts. Soak these 
ingredients in a brine made from one 
cupful of salt and a gallon of water. 
Scald them in this brine water after 
they have soaked for 24 hours, and 
then drain. Mix the mustard, tumeric 
and flour in a large saucepan; add a 
small amount of vinegar, stirring the 
mixture to a smooth paste; add all the 
vinegar and heat the mixture, stir- 
ring it constantly until it is thick. 
Then add the spices, brown sugar and 
all the other ingredients. Cook for 
five minutes, put into crocks and seal. 

Chow Chow. 

Two quarts cabbage, 1 quart green 
tomatoes, y 2 pint onions, 1 pint cu- 
cumbers, 2 medium green peppers, 2-3 
cup sugar, % teaspoonful ground all- 
spice, % teaspoonful ground cinna- 
mon, 1 tablespoonful mustard seed, 
vinegar to barely cover. Chop toma- 
toes, add % cup salt, let stand over 
night, drain and cook all ingredients 
together. Let it just come to boil and 
bottle or can in jars. — Mrs. "W. R. 
Crow, 1153 Forty-ninth avenue S. E. 

Chow Chow (Without Cucumbers.) 

Take 1 peck of green tomatoes, 6 
large onions, 1 dozen green peppers, 
1 large cabbage. Slice tomatoes, 
sprinkle over them 1 teacupful salt; 
let them stand over night, drain off 
the liquor, chop fine, add the onions, 
cabbage and peppers, also chopped 
fine. Put on the fire to cook with 
enough cider vinegar to cover them. 
Add black pepper, cinnamon, cloves 
and allspice to suit the taste, and 1 
cup sugar. Cook until tender, then 
seal in jars. I get 5 cents worth of 
mixed spices and use about one-third. 
T like them better ground fine before

adding-, and leaving green peppers, 
black pepper, cinnamon, cloves and 
allspice out. — Mrs. E. Bergstrom, 1399 
Burrage street. 

Chili Sauce. 

Scald and peel 24 ripe tomatoes; 
chop these up with two red bullnose 
peppers, two green bullnose peppers 
and two large onions. Put into an 
enameled saucepan and add the fol- 
lowing: Four cupfuls vinegar, iy 2 
cupfuls brown .sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls 
salt, 2 teaspoonfuls whole allspice, 2 
teaspoonfuls whole cloves, 2 teaspoon- 
fuls cinnamon, 2 teaspoonfuls ginger, 
2 teaspoonfuls ground nutmeg. Cook 
until the sauce begins to thicken and 
the onions are well done; this should 
not take over an hour. Remove the 
vessel from the stove. Put the chili 
sauce into jars and seal while hot. 
This will keep in a wide-mouthed 
bottle, if it is well corked and dipped 
in paraffine. — Jane Shumway. 

Chili Sauce. 

Mrs. C. R. Moody, 6829 Forty-sixth 
avenue S. E., city, sends us these 
recipes, and says: "These are all 
good, as I use them every year. This 
is my first attempt, and I hope I may 
call again. (We do, also. — Aunt 
Prudence..) 

Twenty-four ripe tomatoes, 4 on- 
ions, two green peppers, two large 
teaspoonfuls each of salt and ground 
cinnamon, 2 dozen whole cloves, 3 
cups of vinegar and sugar to taste. 
Put all through the food chopper, 
cook iy 2 hours, then put in jars or 
bottles and seal. 

Chili Sauce. 

Pare 12 large tomatoes, chop them 
fine, peel 2 good-sized onions, chop 
fine and add to tomato. Chop very 
fine 4 medium-sized green peppers 
and add to mixture. Stir all together 
and add 2 tablespoonfuls salt, 2 table- 
spoonfuls sugar, 1 tablespoonful cin- 
namon, 3 teacups vinegar. Boil till 
thick as catchup and bottle. This 
makes two pints. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 
1153 Forty-ninth avenue S. E. 

Chili Sauce. 

One dozen ripe tomatoes, 4 large 
onions, 4 red peppers, all chopped 
fine; 4 cups vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls 
salt, 2 teaspoonfuls each ground 
cloves, cinnamon and ginger. Boil 
two hours. 

Piccalilli. 

Two cauliflowers, 2 quarts green 
tomatoes, 1 quart small onions, 24 me- 
dium size cucumbers, 3 green peppers. 
Chop all together and soak over 



night in a weak brine. Next day 
scald for a few minutes, then drain 
through a colander. Make a dressing 
with the following: 

One-half pound mustard, 4 tea- 
spoonfuls celery seed, 5 cupfuls sugar, 
1 cupful flour, % ounce tumeric. Mix 
all of these ingredients to a smooth 
paste; then add them to three quarts 
of boiling vinegar and allow to boil 
for two minutes. Pour it over the 
pickle and, when cold, bottle and seal 
with paraffine. This pickle will keep 
for a year. Salt may be used instead 
of the brine and cabbage instead of 
the cauliflower, if preferred. — Jane 
Shumway. 

French Pickles. 

One peck of green tomatoes, sliced, 
6 large onions, sliced; mix these and 
throw over them 1 teacupful salt, and 
let stand over night; next day drain 
thoroughly and boil in 1 quart vine- 
gar mixed with 2 quarts of water for 
15 or 20 minutes; then drain. Take 
4 quarts of vinegar, 2 pounds of 
brown sugar, % pound white mustard 
seed, 2 tablespoonfuls allspice and the 
same of cinnamon, cloves, ginger and 
ground mustard. Throw all together 
and boil 15 minutes.

these and throw over them 1 teacup 
of salt and let them stand over night. 
Next day drain thoroughly and boil 
in 1 quart vinegar mixed with two

Throw all together and boil 15 min- 
utes. — Mrs. President R. B. Hayes, 
Washington, D. C. 

(I like to use large and yellowish 
green tomatoes, those that would soon 
ripen, and cut them in thick slices. 
Do not cook them to pieces. The 
spices can be varied to taste, leaving 
out any you don't like; allspice makes 
pickles black and a very little goes 
a long way.)

vinegar and re-scald. Pack in jars 
and fill with hot vinegar. Boil 15 
minutes in boiler to seal with self- 
sealing li,ds. — Mrs. E. Bergstrom, 1399 
Burrage street. 

Perfection Pickles. 

It's pure delight to can cucumbers 
after the following. These will keep 
in an open jar as long as there is a 
plate over them weighted to keep 
them under the brine. 

Wash and wipe cucumbers, pack in 
jars or cans, cut the large ones into 
quarters (they keep equally as well), 
and cover with the following mixture: 
One cup mustard, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup 
salt. Put with .1 gallon cider vine- 
gar. Mix thoroughly and pour over 
pickles cold. They are ready for use 
in eight days. 

To flavor the above use three bay 
leaves to the quart for some cans or 
crocks, or use 1 teaspoonful mixed 
spices or a bit of dill for other cans. — 
Mrs. Williams. 

(These are uncooked and may be 
put into crock unsealed. The easiest 
and best way I ever found to make 
sour cucumber pickles. — Aunt Pru- 
dence.) 

Cucumbers. 

Cucumbers that are too large or 



ripe for ordinary pickles are fine 
peeled, the seeds cut out, cut in 
fourths lengthwise, then crosswise. 
Stand in weak brine over night, drain, 
put in to each quart 1 tablespoonful 
mustard seed, 1 teaspoonful sugar; 
cover with cold vinegar. — Mrs. W. R. 
Crow, 1153 Forty-ninth avenue S. E. 

Dill Pickles. 

Guaranteed against failure. 

Wash medium sized pickles and 
place in stone crocks. Put two lay- 
ers of cucumbers, then one layer of 
dill plant till crock is half full. Then 
put in a layer of grape leaves. Any 
more leaves makes them too sour. 
Then alternate cucumbers and dill 
until jar is almost full. Now put on 
a small plate and a clean rock to hold 
pickles down. Make a brine in pro- 
portion of 1 cup of salt to 16 cups of 
water. Pour over cucumbers until jar 
is full; 1 scant teaspoonful of pow- 
dered alum to 1 gallon of brine will 
keep them firm and crisp. These 
pickles are not too salty, the main 
fault of dill pickles. They must be 
kept well under the brine or they will 
get soft. The scum that rises should 
be taken off about once a week.— 
Mrs. Claud C. Miller, 1137 East Twen- 
ty-sixth street North. 

Dill Pickles. 

Jennie C. Hoelzer, 199 Monroe street, 
sends these: 

Take medium sized cucumbers, 
wash in cold water, then fill quart 
jars. Put in each jar % cup vinegar, 
1 tablespoonful sugar, 2 table- 
spoonfuls salt, pinch of pickling 
spices and spray of dill. Fill rest of 
space in jars with cold water and 
seal. These pickles are very good and 
will keep indefinitely. 

Good Dill Pickles. 

Take large green cucumbers with a 
little of the stem left on, wash and 
put in a stone crock, the bottom of 
which has been covered with grape 
leaves and several pieces of dill. On 
this put a layer of cucumbers and 
then more grape leaves and dill, and 
so on until the top of the crock has 
been reached. Put lots of grape leaves 
on top. Cover with strong salt water 
and put a large dinner plate, weighted 
down with a clean rock, on top in 
order to keep the pickles immersed in 
the solution. Keep in a warm place 
two weeks and then put in a cool 
place for the winter. — Mrs. Nat 
Smythe, 443 East Thirty-eighth street.

Dill Pickles. 

One quart of water, 1 pint vinegar, 
Y2 gill of salt. Put together and let 
come to a boil. Do not put in cu- 
cumbers until cool. 

Put 1 gallon of cucumbers (enough 
to fill two 2-quart jars) in weak salt 
water over night, rinse them in clear 
water in the morning, pack into jars 
with layers of cherry leaves and one 
bunch of dill flora to each layer of 
cucumbers. When jar is full pour 
over vinegar. There are two cucum- 
bers to the layer. — Mrs. E. Bergstrom, 
1399 Burrage street. 

Dill Pickles. 

Wash cucumbers, roll each cucum- 
ber in a grape leaf and pack in 2- 
quart jars or stone jars with dill be- 
tween. To a gallon of cucumbers take 
about 6 head of dill, stem and all. 
Cover with water that has been 
boiled, to which has been added one 
cup of salt for each gallon of water. 
If jar is used put plate with rock on 
to keep under water, set in a warm 
place for 10 days. — Mrs. Williams. 

Dandy Sweet Pickles. 

Oh, housewives, you who make 
wrinkled, shrunken pickles, here's a 
recipe you are waiting for. Don't 
you like the nice solid, crisp pickles 
you get at the store? Here is the 
way to make them like that, only ten 
times better. 

Pick small cucumbers from your 
war garden, leaving piece of stem on 
each cucumber. This helps to keep 
them solid. Wash and place in stone 
crock. Make brine strong enough to 
float an egg. Pour over cucumbers. 
Put a plate and stone (not too heavy) 
to hold them under brine. Then fill 
remainder of crock with brine. Every 
day you can pick a few cucumbers 
from your vines and add to this till 
jar is full. 

In two weeks they are ready for the 
finishing process. Pour off brine and 
cover with fresh water, leaving for 
24 hours to remove salt. Take enough 
vinegar to cover pickles. (If very 
strong must be diluted with water.) 
Add sugar to taste. About 4 cupfuls 
to a gallon of vinegar. Prepare a 
small bag of mixed pickling spices. 
Put in the vinegar. Bring vinegar to 
a boil. Pour off water from cucum- 
bers and when vinegar is boiling 
pour over the cucumbers. Cover with 
a cloth. A teaspoonful of powdered 
alum to a gallon of vinegar keeps the 
pickles firm and crisp. The next day 
pour off vinegar, re-heat, putting in 
the bag of spices again. When boil- 
ing, pour over pickles, and that is the 
end thereof. — Mrs. Claud C Miller 
1137 East Twenty-sixth street North' 



Ripe Cucumber Pickles. 

Take 24 large cucumbers, ripe and 
sound; 6 white onions and 4 large red 
peppers. Pare and remove the seeds 
from the cucumbers; chop well, not 
too fine; then chop fine the onions 
and peppers. Mix thoroughly with 1 
cupful of salt, 1 ounce white mus- 
tard seed. Place in a muslin bag and 
drain 24 hours. Remove to glass jars, 
cover with cold vinegar and seal. 
They will keep a long time and are 
excellent. — Mrs. C. M. Hall, 790 East 
Ankeny street. 

Oil Cucumber Pickles. 

25 medium cucumbers. 

1 cup of yellow mustard seed. 

1 tablespoonful celery seed. 

% cup salt. 

1 cup salad oil. 

1 quart vinegar. 

Cut cucumbers in thin slices, place 
in jar in layers with the spices, oil 
and salt, and pour vinegar over the 
whole. Seal tight. — Mrs. H. M. Morse, 
451 Ainsworth avenue. 

Spiced Green Tomato Pickle. 

Slice 2 gallons green tomatoes % 
inch thick, put 1 cup salt in enough 
water to cover; let stand two hours. 
Drain, pressing out all brine. Take 
1 quart cider vinegar, 1 level table- 
spoonful each ground cloves, peppers, 
allspice, ginger and cinnamon and 1 
pound brown sugar. Boil up, add to- 
matoes and simmer till tomatoes are 
barely tender. Can while hot, or it 
will keep in open dishes if kept cool. 
— Mrs. W. R. Crow. 

Ripe Tomato Pickle. 

This is an extra good recipe for an 
uncooked pickle in which you can 
use your partly ripe tomatoes, though, 
of course, the bright red ones look 
prettier. 

Three pints tomatoes, peeled and 
chopped (cut not too ripe), 1 cup 
chopped celery, 4 tablespoonfuls 
chopped red pepper, 4 tablespoonfuls 
chopped onion, 4 tablespoonfuls salt, 
6 tablespoonfuls sugar, 6 tablespoon- 
fuls mustard seed, % teaspoonful 
cloves, % teaspoonful cinnamon, 1 
teaspoonful grated nutmeg, 2 cups 
vinegar. Mix in order given. Put in 
a stone jar and cover. Must stand a 
week before using, but may be kept 
a year after. — Fannie Merrill Farmer. 

Ripe Tobato Pickles. 

Pare ripe sound tomatoes (do not 
scald). Put in jars; scald; add spices 
(tied in a bag) in vinegar, and pour 
while hot over them. This recipe is 
best for persons who prefer raw to- 
matoes. — Mrs. C. M. Hill, 790 East An- 
keny street. 



PICKLES AND RELISHES. 



:;:; 



Tomato Catchup. 

Will keep without sealing. 

One-half bushel ripe tomatoes; cook 
until it can be strained through a 
sieve. Boil, stirring till as thick as 
apple butter. Add 4 ounces salt, 3 
ounces black pepper, 1 ounce cinna- 
mon, 2 cups brown sugar, y& ounce 
cloves, 1 dram cayenne, 1 gallon cider 
vinegar. Boil a few moments to thor- 
oughly season. 

Bottle while hot and cork tightly. 
I always put in one-half dozen onions 
and cook with tomatoes before strain- 
ing. 

Put your corks into a pan of hot 
water and set on stove for an hour 
before using. Tie in the cork. — Mrs. 
C. L. Jordan, 2638 Tenth street, Ba- 
ker, Or. 

Spiced Cantaloupe Pickles. 

Five pounds half-ripe cantaloupe, 4 
pounds sugar, 2-3 pint vinegar, 1 ta- 
blespoonful each allspice, cloves and 
cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful ginger. Pare 
the fruit, cut into inch strips, let 
stand in the sugar until it has made 
a syrup. Add the vinegar and spices. 
Cook till clear. Skim out fruit, cook 
syrup down until thick, pour over 
fruit and seal. — Mrs. W. R. Crow, 1153 
Forty-ninth avenue S. E. 

Small Onions. 

If you have small onions in your 
garden that do not dry off they can 
be canned. Peel, cover with cold wa- 
ter and bring to a boil; drain, cover 
with boiling water, add salt to taste 
and place in cans. These can be pre- 
pared by placing in a kettle of boiling 
water on top of the stove, or in a 
pan with a little water placed in the 
oven when cold and let come to a 
good boil. Remove and seal. — Mrs. 
Williams. 

Pickled Carrots. 

Take small carrots, scald them and 
rub off the skin. Parboil them in 
salted water (care should be taken 
not to cook them soft), drain and put 
them in a jar. Boil vinegar enough 
to cover them, pour it in and let it 
remain 24 hours. Then drain off the 
vinegar and boil it again, adding salt. 
Put one bayleaf and three or four 
cloves in with the carrots and pour 
the boiling salted vinegar over them. 

These pickled carrots add color and 
zest to salad dishes. — Mrs. H. M. 
Morse, 451 Ainsworth avenue. 

Sauerkraut. 

Shred cabbage with vegetable slicer, 
pound in stone jar with wooden po- 
tato masher, sprinkling a teaspoonful 



of salt between each layer of cabbage. 
When jar is filled put clean white

place 10 days till finished. Wash the 
cloth every day. If it becomes too 
sour boil one hour in open kettle and 
can. — Mrs. Williams. 

Canned Red Peppers.

hard to find in print.) 
Wash one peck red peppers, cut a 
Slice from stem and remove seeds; 
then cut in thin strips with scissors. 
Cover with boiling water, let stand 
two minutes, drain and plunge into 
ice water. Let stand 10 minutes; 
again drain and pack solidly into 
glass jars. Boil one quart vinegar 
and two cups sugar 15 minutes. Pour 
over peppers to overflow jars. Seal 
and keep in a cool place. Fine for 
salad.

Green Tomato Mincemeat. 

Here is one of my economical and 
tried recipes, and I do want you to 
try it. The recipe is just green toma- 
toes, vinegar, sugar, salt, raisins and 
spices, cooked down together, and it 
doesn't sound very good, but really is 
surprisingly good. Some people use 
half apples, but I do not see that that 



34 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



improves it any, and we all have so 
many green tomatoes in our war gar- 
dens that we want to save before the 
frost catches them, that my advice is 
to use the recipe as it is, and put in 
your apples, etc., later if you want to. 

The beauty of this mincemeat is 
that it is perfectly wholesome; a dys- 
peptic can eat it in the middle of the 
night without its hurting him (at 
least he might try it once), and it is 
really good, so that everyone compli- 
ments your pie and can't believe that 
there is no meat in it. This is the 
recipe — sent me from a cousin in New 
York state: 

One peck green tomatoes, chopped 
and drained; 5 pounds brown sugar, 2 
tablespoonfuls each of salt, cloves, 
cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg, 2 
pounds raisins (seeded if necessary) ; 
one cupful vinegar (and if it is the 
vinegar from sweet pickles so much 
the better). Cook slowly three hours 
and can in glass jars as usual. It is 
very good as it is, but rather dry, so 
I always add some kind of fruit when 
I open it — any canned fruit I have 
opened, or a glass of jelly or quince 
honey, etc., is very good. More rai- 
sins or English currants can be added 
or lemons, oranges or anything else 
used in mincemeat, but you will find 
this recipe a most satisfactory base to 
work with, and your pie, being all 



fruit, will not be indigestible. Of 
course, this is exceedingly cheap as 
compared to regular mincemeat, and 
it has also the merit of being a meat 
substitute, and I suppose a great 
many hundred pounds of lean beef 
and many pounds of butter are being 
made up into mincemeat in our coun- 
try at this time of year. 

AUNT PRUDENCE, 

Making Vinegar. 

When cooking apples save the par- 
ings and cores (if sound). They can 
be thrown into a jar from time to 
time as they accumulate. Add enough 
soft water to cover, a cup of sugar 
to each seven quarts of water; keep 
covered with netting. Add a bit of 
yeast, and set in a warm place. Vine- 
gar can be made from any fruit jelly 
or berry juice which has begun fer- 
menting by adding water (three times 
the amount of the juice) and a little 
yeast or "mother" of vinegar. 

Pear vinegar is made from parings 
and cores of pears same as apple vine- 
gar, and is most delicious for salads. 

Before canning fruit, etc., I always 
put cans in boiler of cold water to 
which has been added one tablespoon- 
ful of lye, and rinse, to clean jars. — 
Mrs. W. W. Williams, 1411 Rodney 
avenue.

If so, do not add the cost of parsley 
to your recipe.

AN EXPLANATION OF THE FOLLOWING RECIPES 



A few women are afraid of our 
formal way of expressing our recipes 
exactly. They never have measured 
their flour, seasoning, etc., and they 
hardly feel like beginning new ways 
now when they do so excellently in 
their old ways. But the trouble is 
just here. We are dealing with many 
young women who have been busi- 
ness girls for years before they were 
married and perhaps their mothers 
were before them and all the house- 
hold ways that we older home women 
have seen and understood and prac- 
ticed all our lives are new to them. 
You say of your bread, etc., and the 
recipe books say, too, "flour to mix 
stiff." How does an inexperienced 
housewife know just what "stiff" is? 
If they do know they don't need your 
recipe, for they can use any recipe 
book if they want something new, but 
those who need your recipe want to 
know just how much flour, just how 
much seasoning, etc., you use. Of 
course I know all flours are not alike 
some breads take more than others, 
etc., but those are fine points that 
come later, when the recipe is used 



often and each housewife learns to 
adapt it to her own needs. The U. S. 
government publishes recipes giving 
definite amounts of each ingredient 
used, and I believe that is the busi- 
ness-like way in which the new wo- 
man will want her recipes in future. 
Of course, our prices will not' last 
forever, foodstuffs vary, but that isn't 
the point. The comparative price will 
be very much the same and that is 
what we are after. We can't (that is 
we women right here alone — can't) 
change the prices we have to pay for 
food very much, but our concern must 
be to find the best and most econom- 
ical ways of using that food, and I 
cannot see how we can tell which 
recipe is really the cheapest and most 
desirable, unless we work out the cost 
of all the items as we do here, for 
price, and then consider the amount 
of nourishment the ingredients con- 
tain, and I do not think it will be at 
all laborious to work out these re- 
sults in costs for yourselves, with the 
foregoing tables.

The Cost of Fuels 



I hear people saying everywhere: 
"Oh, we don't bake our own bread 
any more. Fuel is so high it doesn't 
pay." But they don't know just what 
it will cost them to bake their own 
bread. No one ever has known. We 
are getting these figures for you ab- 
solutely for the first time they have 
ever been obtained on a common 
comparable standard. 

The Portland Railway, Light & 
Power company and the Northwestern 
Electric company guarantee these 
figures for electric heat, the Portland 
Gas & Coke company for gas, and the 
Holman Fuel company theirs for both 
slabwood and first-class fir. 

First we give the exact figures of 
the cost of heating a cold six-burner 
electric range, to the right heat, and 
baking six loaves of home-made bread 
in 45 minutes. 



Next we give the figures for exact- 
ly the same conditions on a gas 
range. 

Then the Holman Fuel company 
gives us the cost of heating a cold 
six-griddle stove or range and bak- 
ing six loaves of home-made bread 45 
minutes with slabwood fuel and with 
the best fir wood. This is a definite, 
fixed amount of heat (a moderate 
fire) and can be used as a standard 
of measure and comparison. 

Second, we asked them for the cost 
of a hot oven fire, taking a biscuit 
baking fire as our standard here, and 
third, we asked them for the average 
cost of a top burner fire, averaging 
their lowest and highest flame. This 
it to get a standard comparison. We 
shall need to know each price later 
when we figure the cost of cooking 
on top of our ranges.

THE COST OF FUELS. 



This Is the Statement of the Electric 
Companies. 

Electric heat being so standard, the 
results of two separate tests made by 
each of the electric companies were 
the same as given in the following 
discussion and statement: 

Women have long known that elec- 
tric cooking is cleaner, that it ban- 
ishes all the dust and ashes of coal 
and wood, all the soot and fumes of 
gas. They have known that it makes 
the kitchen cooler, the air purer, that 
it is the most convenient way to cook. 
It is this knowledge which is rap- 
idly becoming general which has re- 
sulted in the installation of thousands 
of electric ranges in the United States 
during the past two or three years 
and which has induced over 3500 
power companies to make special 
cooking rates to attract the business. 
Our own city has the distinction of 
having one of the lowest of these low 
cooking rates. 

Although many of the advantages 
of electric cooking are widely known, 
many people still have the idea that 
electric cooking is expensive. That 
this is not the case may be learned 
by asking a range user or by study- 
ing the table of costs given below. 

To heat to temperature for baking 
bread, .0036; to bake six loaves of 
bread 45 minutes, .0128; total cost of 
baking six loaves of bread, .0164. 

To heat to temperature for baking 
biscuits, .0091; to bake ovenful of 
biscuits (15 minutes), .0051; total cost 
of baking oven of biscuits, .0142. 

After the first batch of biscuits 
is baked the temperature of the oven 
can be maintained at the correct tem- 
perature for baking subsequent 
batches at a cost of .0014 per hour or 
.0004 per batch. 

Cost per hour for 1000-watt burner 
(medium size): Full, .0025; medium, 
.0013; low, .0006. Cost per hour for 
electric iron, .0018. 

The electric range and electric iron 
have done more to lighten the burden 
of keeping house than any other 
household appliances that have come 
into use in recent years. They have 
done for the housewife what the tele- 
phone, typewriter and adding machine 
have done for the man. 

In view of the present war the 
great saving in foodstuffs made pos- 
sible by electric cooking ought to in- 
terest every housewife.

manager, Northwestern Electric com- 
pany. 



A Later Letter. 

(Today we have a communication 
from the electric companies, giving 
you good reasons for the use of elec- 
tricity as a fuel at this time in par- 
ticular, and as we are all vitally in- 
terested in this question, we print it 
as sent to us) : 

Everyone recognizes the fact that 
we cannot live without cooks. Grant- 
ing this, does it not seem reasonable 
that cooks should have the most mod- 
ern and satisfactory cooking appli- 
ances on the market. 

The other day two of my neighbors 
were discussing the use of meats in 
their homes. Mr. Black remarked 
that although meat was very high, his 
family continued to use the customary 
roast of beef for Sunday dinner, as he 
now had a means of cooking it, so 
that he felt he got as much for his 
money as he did a couple of years ago 
with cheaper meat and cooking it 
differently; that is, the shrinkage of 
the meat was so slight to what it had 
been. Naturally Mr. Black was anx- 
ious for his neighbor, Mr. White, to 
enjoy the same saving by using this 
same means of cooking. After some 
discussion the men decided that the 
solution of this problem would be to 
make an actual test, which they did. 
Two roasts of the same cut were 
ordered from the same butcher, both 
were weighed on the same scales, 
each weighing 6Yz pounds. Immedi- 
ately upon removing the roasts from 
the oven, they were again weighed. 
Mr. Black's roast had only shrunk 
nine ounces, while Mr. White's had 
shrunk 24 ounces. This was a saving 
of 27 cents for Mr. Black on this one 
roast, and as his family used about 
four roasts per month, he figured a 
saving of $1 per month, at the least 
on roasts alone. 

The fact that Mr. Black's roast had 
retained so much of the natural juice 
and flavor of the meat, making it 
more palatable, caused considerable 
comment in the serving. 

The last scene in the act of "con- 
servation of meat" was described to 
me a few minutes ago. The Whites 
are saving money, too, the same as 
the Blacks, as they are now cooking 
by the same method as Mr. Black, 
that is, they "Cook by Wire." 

Portland has the distinction of hav- 
ing one of the lowest electric cook- 
ing rates in the United States. As a 
result, there are approximately 500 
electric ranges in use in the city at

the present time, and I venture to 
say this number will be doubled many 
times within the next two years. 

Prices in nearly all necessities of- 
life, except electric current, are ad- 
vancing- by leaps and bounds every 
day. Where electricity is generated 
by water power, it is not necessary 
to use fuel for cooking-, lighting or 
power purposes, our ships, airplanes 
and other equipment, which will help 
our country in winning this world 
war, warrant us in urging that our 
coal and wood supplies be conserved 
by using them, for every pound of un- 
burned coal is saved, but every kilo- 
watt hour of water power unused is 
wasted. 

Every housewife enjoys a clean, 
light, airy and purely sanitary kit- 
chen, which is made possible for 
everyone when she cooks by wire, as 
this fuel substitute does not consume 
the oxygen in the air, hence there are 
no by-products of combustion, nor 
does it require any matches or clean- 
the powders or constant cleaning of 
the kitchen walls and woodwork. 
Think of the time saved in cleaning 
that may be spent in Red Cross or 
other club work. 

Would you not like to roast you* 
Thanksgiving turkey in an open pan 
without having to baste it, and have 
it cooked to a delicious perfection? 
You can, if you "cook by wire." — Miss 
Marguerite Fleming, home economist, 
Northwestern Electric company. 

In regard to this fuel question in 
general I want to say that no ques- 
tion interests us more than that of 
fuel, and we are glad to have all 
sides presented. 

Of course, wood has been the stand- 
ard fuel of the human race since the 
beginning of time. We might say that 
wood was the basis of civilization, en- 
abling man to emerge from his sav- 
age state (living wild on uncooked 
vegetables and nuts and fruits) and 
attain to the use of cooked foods, in 
a warmed and lighted dwelling , and 
at the present time no fuel is so cheap 
as wood or coal when we consider its 
heat for our homes and for our hot- 
water tanks, at the same time and 
with the same fire as for cooking 
Yet, as Miss Fleming says, it is a 
waste, not a conservation, of our re- 
sources, to use it, and this war may 
lead directly to a wider use of the 
manufactured fuels — gas and elec- 
tricity — on that very account, as well 
as their cleanliness, and especially 
the immense saving of women's labor 
which both give us. It is worth con- 
sideration and discussion. 

AUNT PRUDENCE. 



Gas as a Fuel. 

Today we present to you a detailed 
statement of the general use of gas 
as a fuel, besides the special figures 
asked for, all of which I am sure you 
will find very interesting, as there is 
no subject that comes right home to 
every man, woman and child in the 
city as the cost of fuel does, and will 
more and more during the duration of 
this war. 

This Is the Statement Prepared by 
the Gas Company. 

Find tabulated cost of operating a 
gas range in the home under practical 
conditions, taking for granted that 
the majority of ranges in use in the 
average homes are of a standard 
make and not a cheap, poorly con- 
structed appliance. We know from 
personal observation that a large per 
cent of the ranges in use in the city 
are of a standard make, which means 
good construction, good insulation 
and built according to specifications 
of the National Commercial Gas asso- 
ciation, which insures good efficiency 
and economical operation. 

These figures are based on the use 
of the ordinary gas stove by the ordi- 
nary housewife, not on a demonstra- 
tion by experts under ideal condi- 
tions. 

Bread Baking. 

Bread baking with the 18-inch 
standard oven (which is the standard 
today for domestic ranges), in a 
standard range, baking not over six 
loaves at a time starting with a cold 
oven and operating for one hour. Gas 
consumption for one hour maintain- 
ing a temperature for the proper bak- 
ing of the standard one-pound loaf in 
45 minutes is 25^ cubic feet or 2.55 
cents. Gas consumption for 45 min- 
utes, the time required to bake a 
standard one-pound loaf is 22 cubic 
feet or 2.2 cents. This is based on the 
operating of both burners full for five 
minutes before the bread is put into 
the oven, then turning one burner off 
when the bread is put in and com- 
pleting the baking in 45 minutes, 
making a total of 50 minutes that the 
gas is on. 

To get the adjustment for main- 
taining the temperature for baking 
bread, instead of turning both burn- 
ers down, turn one burner entirely off 
and leave the other burner on full. It 
is preferable to leave the back burner 
on. However, satisfactory results can 
be obtained by turning both burners 
one-half off and a great many prefer 



The Associated Press — the Guaranteed News 



THE COST OF FUELS. 



that method, to turning one burner 
entirely out. The only objection to 
turning both burners half out is that 
you are not always able to judge 
whether you are using the proper 
amount of gas or not. Bread should 
be left in the oven Ave minutes after 
the gas is turned off. 

Biscuit Baking. 

For biscuit baking it is necessary 
to use both oven burners full on. Gas 
consumption for one hour is 47 cubic 
feet or 4.7 cents. However, for the 
proper baking of biscuits, it actually 
requires only 15 minutes for the bis- 
cuits to remain in the oven, the oven 
to be lighted when both burners are 
on full for 10 minutes before the bis- 
cuits are put into the oven, requiring 
25 minutes actual operation to prop- 
erly bake biscuits. This requires a 
gas consumption of 20 cubic feet or 
a gross charge of 2 cents, subject to 
5 per cent discount. 

In a domestic range under practical 
conditions in the home for the bak- 
ing of practically everything there 
are only three heats to be used. One 
is full on both burners, consuming 47 
cubic feet of gas per hour. One is 
half on both burners reduced or one 
turned entirely off, consuming 23% 
cubic feet of gas per hour, and the 
third heat is both burners turned very 
slow or one burner entirely off and 
the other burner on half, which con- 
sumes 11% cubic feet per hour. 

This is the heat that is ordinarily 
used for the baking of angel food, 
fruit cake and other forms of loaf 
cake. Heat number two is used for 
baking of layer cakes, cookies or loaf 
bread. Heat number one, both burners 
full on is used for the baking of bis- 
cuits or cornbread. 

Satisfactory results can be ob- 
tained by starting with a cold oven, 
but a great many prefer to light the 
oven five minutes before the food is 
put into the oven. You can be suc- 
cessful either way. 

Operating Top Burners. 

There are five burners, including 
the simmering burner on the top of 
the standard gas range. There is 
one giant burner, three ordinary 
burners and the simmering burner. 
The giant burner on full will con- 
sume 37 cubic feet of gas per hour. 
This burner should only be used 
where you have a large vessal that 
entirely covers the burner and re- 
quires extreme fast cooking such as 
frying in a large vessel or things 
that require considerable speed. It 
should be used as little as possible as 
a majority of the food cooked on top 
of a range can be cooked on the 
standard burner that consumes a 
maximum of 22.8 cubic feet of gasper 



hour. There is practically nothing 
that you cook on the top of a range 
that requires any of these burners on 
full during the entire operation. No 
burner should be left on full any 
longer than it takes to bring what 
you have on the stove to the boiling 
point and should be immediately re- 
duced one-half or some times cne- 
third of its capacity, which is suffi- 
cient to maintain a temperature to 
cook the food. 

The simmering burner is the burner 
that should be used whenever possible 
and it is possible to use it with good 
results during every meal. It has a 
maximum consumption of four cubic 
feet of gas per hour and is able to 
keep vegetables, soup, coffee, and a 
great many things cooked on the top 
of the stove, boiling sufficiently to 
prepare same at a minimum expense. 

Thisburner is a burner that should 
be used, but is one that is a great 
many times overlooked even by the 
thrifty housewife. In preparing a 
meal on the top of a range, the sim- 
mering burner is the first one to be 
put Into use. Start the process on the 
medium-sized burner and transfer it 
to the simmering burner when It 
comes to a boil. The medium-sized 
burners that consume a maximum of 
22.8 cubic feet of gas per hour on full 
should be used, as a rule starting full 
on and reducing as the food becomes 
hot. If reduced one-half the consump- 
tion would be only 11.4 cubic feet of 
gas per hour or 1.14 cents. If reduced 
to one-third, would consume 7.6 cubic 
feet of gas per hour or 0.07 cents. The 
giant burner, which has the largest 
consumption of any of the burners on 
top, should never be used only as 
above stated. 

Our experience has taught us that 
the average housewife has never 
given sufficient thought to the oper- 
ating of a gas range to obtain the 
best results. It is one of the articles 
of the household that is mostly used 
and as a rule known the least about 
when it comes to the figuring of cost 
and the short cuts to economy. 

It is surprising to find a condition 
such as this existing but it is abso- 
lutely a fact, that we have known 
cases where an article on a burner 
gets to cooking too fast, instead of 
reducing the flame they move the 
vessel partially off the burner, leav- 
ing the gas on full. That may sound 
foolish to some but it actually hap- 
pens in homes in this city. 

It is more essential for the house- 
wife to understand thoroughly the 
operating cost of a gas range than It 
is for her husband to understand the 
economical operation of his automo- 
bile. The gas range is used as a rule

TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



To our knowledge we have never 
investigated a high bill complaint 
where cooking- alone is involved that 
the complaint was not due to the lack 
of knowledg-e of the operating of a 
range or carelessness from an eco- 
nomical point of view. It is a known 
fact that time after time in the aver- 
age home a vessel of water is set on 
the stove to heat and the housewife 
will get busy doing something else 
around the house or talking to her 
neighbor out the back door and let 
the water boil all away. 

It is not as a rule the gas that is 
used that causes the complaint, it is 
the gas that is wasted. 

There is a great deal that could be 
said in regards to the operating of a 
gas range but a large majority of the 
housewives know these things al- 
ready but have never yet taken the 
time and the trouble to put what they 
know to actual use. When they do 
you will be surprised to find what a 
difference it will make in the satis- 
factory preparation of your food in 
addition to reducing the household 
expense. 

It is not the gas company's desire 
to have a consumer use all the gas 
that he can, because invariably that 
creates a complaint. It is the gas 
company's desire for you to use only 
the gas that is necessary to do what 
you want to do economically. — Mr. S. 
C. Bratton, commercial manager 
Portland Gas & Coke company. 

Wood — The Old Reliable Fuel. 

Here are the figures of the wood 
companies, which I know will be of 
vital interest to every citizen of Port- 
land. 

Mr. Holman, of the Holman Fuel 
company, deserves our thanks and 
appreciation, as he took the trouble 
to personally obtain these figures for 
us. This requires obtaining the 
weight of the wood used in cooking 
and in the cord, watching the time 
needed, etc., and much figuring, which 
he was very careful to verify. This is 
absolutely original work and very 
valuable. This is Mr. Holman's state- 
ment: 



Fir firewood — One cord dry fir 
cordwood, 4 feet, 3195 pounds. 

Nine pounds best fir to bake bis- 
cuits cost .023. 

Thirteen pounds best fir to bake six 
19-ounce loaves bread, 50 minutes, 
cost .034. 

Fir cordwood at $8.50 per cord in 
the basement (present price) stove 
length. 

Wood purchased earlier at less per 
cord would reduce amount of cost .004 
for each $1. 

At the same time bread was bak- 
ing the top of wood range was avail- 
able for cooking for 20 persons in ad- 
dition to having 40 gallons of hot 
water in the boiler within one hour 
and 30 minutes, or the full duration 
of the fire. 

Fir slabwood — One cord dry fir 
slabwood, four foot, weighs 3472 
pounds. 

Nineteen pounds to bake six 19- 
ounce loaves bread, 65 minutes, cost 
.031. 

Present price per cord $5.75 in 
basement, stove lengths. 

Slabwood purchased earlier at less 
per cord would reduce amount of cost 
of baking V 2 cent for each $1 on price 
of wood. 

Available facilities for cooking and 
heating the hot water boilers are the 
same as in the case of the cordwood. 
In both cases fire was started in cold 
stoves, with full draft the entire 
time. 

As Mr. Edlefsen was away and his 
people extremely busy on that ac- 
count, they were unable to make per- 
sonal tests, but obtained figures of 
fuel used from good cooks of their 
acquaintance which they believe to be 
very nearly correct. We are very glad 
of this estimate, as it all helps us to 
get an idea of comparisons. 

This is the Edlefsen Fuel company's 
statement: 

The average cost for baking six 
loaves of bread, one hour, with dry 
fir cordwood at $7.50 per cord, is 
.0125. 

With dry slabwood at $5 per cord it 
is .0116. 

With Hiawatha, Wyoming or Wash- 
ington coal, .0112. 

Biscuits — Fir, .0104; slab, .0095; 
coal, .0094. 



The Conservation of Wheat 

This is Accomplished in four ways : 

I. By using a part of some meal or grain aside from wheat in 
making breads and other foods. 

II. By using a part of some cooked substitute in place of part 
of the wheat in making breads and other foods. 

III. By saving all waste of bread and all other wheat foods. 

IV. By going without bread entirely, using some other food con- 
taining similar nourishment in its place. 

I. and II. are fully treated and recipes for making bread in 
this way given in the following pages. We have : 

U. S. Government Recipe for No. I. and discussion of 
methods. 

U. S. Government Recipe for No. II. with tables of var- 
ious cooked substitutes and discussion of methods. 
Recipes for making White Bread in all ways. 
Recipes for making Whole Wheat Breads. 
Recipes for making Graham Breads. 
Recipes for making Corn Meal Breads. 
Recipes for Oat Meal Breads. 
Recipes for Brown Breads. 
Recipes for some Special Breads. 

III. Under the saving of all waste we have : 

The Conservation of Bread Crumbs and Stale Bread. 
Hot Cakes made to conserve wheat. 

IV. Substitutes for Wheat Flour are : The Cornmeal, Oat- 
meal and Rice Breads, and the use of Rice and other 
grains in Porridges. Also the use of Starchy Vegetables 
in place of part of the bread at meals. 



General Food Values 



(As a foundation.) 



From an official source we learn: 
"Pood has been defined as a well- 
tasting mixture of food stuff of such 
a composition that the body is not 
injured by its use, and of a suf- 
ficient quantity to maintain the body 
in good condition." 

Food may be considered under three 
heads: 

1. Value of flavor. 

2. Importance of composition. 

3. Importance of quantity. 

Under the first it is known that the 
flavor of food, both as to smell and 
taste, causes the "mouth to water," as 
we say, which is really the supply of 
the juices, both in the mouth and in 
the stomach, which are necessary to 
the digestion of the food. So that our 
desire that food be palatable and ap- 
petizing is not just a refinement of 
civilization, but is absolutely neces- 
sary to the proper digestion of the 
food. However, this does not mean 
that food shall be so elaborately pre- 
pared, so highly seasoned, or so ar- 
tistically decorated and arranged In 
serving, (as is pictured in most cook 
books and magazines) that one 
strong woman's whole time must nec- 
essarily be given to preparing th3 
food for an ordinary family. 

This is epicureanism, and doesn't 
seem to me desirable even for rich 
people who can afford to pay for it, 
If there were more "plain living and 
high thinking" among our wealthy 
classes the world would be immeas- 
urably improved. The real desirable 
flavor and odor is the simple appe- 
tizing taste and smell of a fresh loaf 
of perfect home-made bread, and no 
French chef can excel it for real 
wholesomeness for body and mind. 

The second point mentioned, the 
importance of the composition of our 
food, we have all studied and read 
about, but it may be worth while to 
review it briefly. The main elements 
of food are protein, carbohydrates 
and fat, besides water and salts. Pro- 
tein is the muscle-building food. "It 
is the characteristic solid constituent 
of muscle," so one who does much 
bodily labor needs more of this than 
those doing different work. In the 
human body 2% parts out of every 
1000 (on an average) of its protein 
are daily worn out and renewed, like 
a building needing one new brick in 
every 400 to be replaced every day. 
Protein is the essential constituent 
of all meats, fish and eggs. It is 
largely in milk, and, mixed with fat, 
in cheese. Proteins are also found in 
all vegetable food, but all the 17 
kinds of protein are not found in all 
vegetables. Thus it requires a much 



large amount of vegetables than of 
the animal foods mentioned, to main- 
tain the body in repair. 

The carbohydrates exist in sugars 
and starches, and their function is to 
keep the body warm and furnish en- 
ergy. 

The fat has much the same use, and 
is a bodily savings bank deposit. It 
is our reserve fund laid up for use in 
case of sickness, just as truly as you 
keep an emergency fund in the bank. 
So those men and women of middle 
age think wrongly who deplore their 
tendency to lay on surplus fat, be- 
cause it is not present in youth, when 
health and vitality are high and there 
is not much need of reserve funds of 
any kind. Of course, like all good 
things, this can be carried to excess, 
and "nobody loves a fat man" for the 
same reason that nobody loves a 
miser — too much hoarding isn't ad- 
mirable. However, dear ladies who 
are nice and round and comfortable, 
do be satisfied, and not strive any 
harder to reduce your flesh than your 
bank account. 

In regard to the importance of the 
quantity of food taken, the bulletin 
says that many people do not eat 
enough to properly nourish their 
body. That many well-meaning doc- 
tors put illy nourished patients, and 
babies, on such a restricted diet that 
they are slowly starved to death. 
Food in sufficient quantity is just as 
necessary to maintain life as fuel is 
to the running of machinery. 

In this connection we will give our 

Conditions of Judging Contests. 

A copy of these conditions were 
sent to each judge' and were used for 
all recipes in this book. 

Thirty per cent, or .3 of the value 
of your recipes will be in its econ- 
omy; 30 per cent, or .3, of the value 
will be in its food value, from a real 
nourishing body-building standpoint; 
and only 40 per cent, or .4 — less than 
half — will be the value of the taste, 
looks, etc., the very things that have 
been and are now very generally the 
sole determining factor in all other 
contests and columns of printed reci- 
pes. Our contests will be largely de- 
cided by economy, viz., economy of 
money and materials, especially in 
making use of all the culls that are 
usually thrown away, and economy of 
time, in shorter and simpler ways of 
doing things. The element of pala- 
tability will be largely with reference 
to variety, the invention of new seas- 
onings and flavors to give relish 
through variety to the staple foods 
that we mast use so often. But we 
women must wake up to the fact that

our country is at war; that ovir gov- 
ernment asks us to practice economy 
without sacrifice of the proper nour- 
ishment of our families, and that we 
have, in consequence, to revise all our 



old standards of living - that served us 
in peace times; and the very reason 
The Telegram started this new de- 
partment of the paper is to help you 
to do this. 



Bread Making 



Here are some gleanings from a 
United States department of agricul- 
ture bulletin, which seem to me very 
valuable: 

The necessary materials for mak- 
ing bread are flour, water, yeast and 
salt. Sometimes a little sugar or fat 
is added, and milk substituted for 
water. These substitutes contribute 
somewhat to the nutritive value of 
the bread, but are used in such small 
amounts that they are much less im- 
portant than the flour. The food 
value of a pound of bread is, there- 
fore, not far different from that of 
the flour used in making it. 

To make a one-pound loaf of bread 
requires about two-thirds of a pound 
— or 11 ounces — of wheat flour, and it 
contains: 

Ys pound of starch, which serves as 
fuel. 

IY2 ounces of protein, which is fuel 
and builds and repairs the body also. 

1 ounce of water. 

The small remaining portion con- 
tains fat and sugar, serving chiefly 
as fuel; cellulose in whole-wheat, 
etc., bread, giving bulk and prevent- 
ing constipation; mineral substances 
which make bones and teeth and 
have other uses, and some other val- 
uable substances which are just be- 
coming known. 

Bread of any kind is not a complete 
food for supplying all needs of the 
human body. It supplies too much 
fuel in proportion to the body-build- 
ing material. Therefore, more pro- 
tein must be taken with bread to 
make a balanced ration, but bread is 
the most valuable single food pro- 
duced. 

Wheat Conservation Bread Making. 

(Government Receipes.) 

The United States government 
urges us to give a quarter of our 
bread to the hungry people in Eu- 
rope, who are fighting our battles, as 
well as their own, by reducing our 
consumption of wheat by about one- 
fourth. 

To do this, instead of using all- 
wheat flour in making bread, we 
must use three-fourths of the usual 
amount of wheat flour and substi- 
tute one-fourth the amount of some 
other kind of flour or other ingredi- 
ent. 

Two methods are recommended. 



The first is to make bread by what 
is called the "short or straight 
dough" process, in which all the sub- 
stitutes used for wheat flour are un- 
cooked, such as cornmeal, rice meal, 
etc. The quantities given make four 
loaves; to make less or more loaves 
decrease or increase the amounts of 
each ingredient, accordingly. Use 
any amount of the substitute up to 
cne-fourth of the total amount of 
flour ordinarily used. A 10 per cent 
mixture of cornmeal and oatmeal 
would probably be best at first, tui 
you were accustomed to it, but the 
addition of one-quarter rye flour or 
barley flour makes a bread that you 
can hardly tell from white flour 
bread. The proportion of the other 
ingredients is the same in all cases, 
with the exception that some of the 
mixtures will be found to require 
more water than others. In general, 
bread made with any. of these sub- 
stitutes requires only about two- 
thirds as long time to ferment in 
the pan as ordinary bread, while the 
baking should be a little slower and 
longer. They must be very well 
baked to keep as well as the all- 
wheat bread. 

Every woman is urged by the gov- 
ernment to use that substitute which 
is cheapest and most plentiful in her 
own locality. Corn is a nearly uni-. 
versal crop, and for years we have 
been urged to eat more cornmeal for 
our health's sake; now it is even 
more strongly advocated as a meas- 
ure of national conservation. Bread, 
made of one-fourth rye or barley 
flour is attractive and wholesome. 

Bran bread is used as a body regu- 
lator for constipation, and should not 
be used regularly, but only when' 
needed as a medicine. You can pur- 
chase bran at a feed store and steril- 
ize it at home by placing it in your' 
oven with the door open, for half an 
hour with a moderate fire. It is much-' 
cheaper this way. 

The first U. S. government recipes 
for bread are figured out in two 
ways: First, using half milk and' 
half water and sugar and lard, in the 
first estimate, all of which the gov-' 
ernment bulletin says is simply aj 
matter of taste and which most of 
the good bread makers condemn. In 
this first recipe we find the bread 
costs 7% cents per loaf. Second: In 
the second reckoning of the recipe 



16 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



we left out the milk, sugar and lard, 
and found our cost reduced exactly 
2V2 cents, or the bread costing 5 1 /* 
cents per loaf. Please notice that the 
omission of the milk, sugar and lard 
reduces the price of one loaf 2% 
cents. So we find that it is not the 
variations in the price of flour, or 
the high cost of fuel that makes our 
home-made loaf of bread expensive, 
but it is the ingredients we put in it 
that are not wholesome or economi- 
cal, but only please an acquired ap- 
petite. Mrs. Rorer, in her new cook 
book, says: "To make good, whole- 



seme, sweet bread, do not use such 
materials as lard, butter or sugar. 
Sugar may be added if the yeast is 
poor to help its action, but lard and 
butter retard the action of yeast and 
prevent the bread from being sweet 
and wholesome." 

"Save the Fats and Sugar." 

In our work, the cheaper loaf, of 
the same food value and general at- 
tractiveness, will be counted as bet- 
ter than the more expensive one con- 
taining various palatable additions.

In the above recipe we are asked 
to use one-fourth meal or flour of 
some other kind than wheat in place 
of all wheat flour. 

Short or straight dough process. 
Four loaves: One quart of lukewarm 
milk, water, or a mixture of the two, 
and two cakes of compressed or dry 
yeast, or three cupfuls of lukewarm 
milk, water, or a mixture of the two, 
and one cupful of liquid yeast. To 
either yeast mixture add one and a 
half tablespoonfuls of salt, one cup- 
ful of sugar, quarter cupful or less 
of fat, if used, and three quarts of 
sifted flour. If dry yeast is used the 
sponge must be set to rise overnight, 
adding the other ingredients in the 
morning. 

Boil the water or scald the milk. 
Put the sugar and salt (and fat if 
used) into a mixing bowl. Pour the 
hot liquid over it and allow it to be- 
come lukewarm. Mix the yeast witli 
a little of the lukewarm liquid and 
add it to the rest of the liquid. If 
convenient set this aside in a warm, 
place — not over 86 degrees Fahren- 
heit — for one hour; if not convenient 
to set it aside add the flour at once, 
putting in a little at a time and 
kneading until the dough is of such 
consistency that it sticks to neither 
the bowl nor the hands. This re- 
quires about 10 minutes. Cover, and 
allow to rise for an hour and three- 



quarters at a temperature of 86 de- 
grees Fahrenheit; it may be better to 
set it at a lower temperature, but the 
lower the temperature, the longer the 
time required for the rising. Cut 
down the dough from the sides of the 
bowl; grease the hands slightly; 
knead the dough a little, shape into 
loaves, place in pans and set aside to 
rise again for one hour, or until a 
light touch will make a dent. With 
good bread flour this happens when 
the dough reaches the top of ths 
pans. Bake for 50 minutes.

light, which should take about two 
hours if the sponge is at a tempera- 
ture of about 86 degrees Fahrenheit. 
To this well-risen sponge add the 
remainder of the flour, thoroughly 
kneading until a smooth and elastic 
dough has been formed. The dough 
must be very stiff, since the boiled 
potato contains a large amount of 
water, which causes the dough to 
soften as it ferments. Add no more 
water unless it is absolutely neces- 
sary. Set back to rise until it has 
trebled in volume, which will require 
another hour or two. Divide the 
dough into four parts, mold them 
separately and place them in greased 
pans slightly warmed. Allow the 
loaves to rise until double in volume 
and bake for 45 minutes.

3 lbs. cooked oatmeal 0408

3 lbs. cooked potatoes 0600 

This 3 lbs. cooked material takes 
the place in the government recipe of

see that oatmeal is the only substi- 
tute which is cheaper than flour 
while cooked corn meal costs about 
the same.

From this table it appears that our 
oatmeal and corn meal, which we 
found the only cheap substitutes to 
use for wheat, are both richer in car- 
bon than wheat, though not so rich 
in protein, but both are far superior 
in food value to potatoes. 

Small potatoes, which are some- 
times recommended for use, are not 
mealy, and do not make good bread. 



SOME ALL-WESTERN RECIPES 



Basis of Our Work. — This is not an 
ordinary baking contest; it is a 
strictly wartime economy contest for 
the purpose of giving an opportunity 
to the women who are wise and' ex- 
perienced housekeepers, and know 
these things, and have enough un- 
selfishness and patriotism to want to 
help others. The idea of doing your 
bit in this most vital factor of our 
national life at this time is an in- 
centive that I know appealed to you 
as the great prize. 

Please understand that it had to be 
a reasonably priced loaf, or at a rea- 
sonable price per dozen, to win any 
prize in our contests. 

For centuries, I suppose, the prizes 
have been given for appearance and 
taste only, but our work is an inno- 



vation. The recipe must show good 
food value, and it must be reasonably 
priced, or all the judges' decisions on 
the looks and taste of the product did 
not give the prize. 

The raisins, lard, eggs, etc., run up 
the cost. We experimented to see 
how good things we could bake and 
yet keep down the cost. 

Do you know some people are real- 
ly ashamed of not being wasteful! I 
never realized that any one could feel 
that way before. I thought it was 
just that they didn't know how to 
be economical. "Poor things! They 
have not been brought up right and 
taught economy." But it is coming 
to me often now that women of lim- 
ited means are really ashamed to 
sign their names to economical

recipes, as they hate to have people 
see how cheaply they cook. Well, 
now, that certainly amazes me. I've 
been so proud of all my economies, 
always, which were drilled into me 
from my infancy up. It was always 
a crime in my mother's household to 
waste anything at all of any kind 
that "some one else might use." She 
saved so as to have more to give — 
always — with no such incentive then 
as we have now in this awful war. 
I have heard her say hundreds of 
times, that there was one motto that 
should be framed and hung in every 
kitchen, and that was Jesus' own 
words of direct command (upon 
which I have never heard a sermon 
preached — why?), when he said: 

"Gather up the fragments that re- 
main, that nothing be lost." 

How did it ever come to be stylish 
to waste and throw away, anyway? 
Won't some of you who feel that you 
like to have people think of you as 
lavish in all your expenditures, 
please write and tell me just why you 
feel that way? I can't understand 
your point of view.

fine, use your potato water and 
enough other water to make 2 quarts. 
Put your potatoes and water and 1 
tablespoonful of salt, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of shortening, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of sugar all together. Stir in 2 quarts 
of flour and let it set over night. 
This will be light in the morning. 
Now mix in enough flour to make a 
firm smooth dough that will not stick 
to the board. This will take about 
9*£ quarts of flour altogether. Set 
in" a warm place and let rise 1% 
hours, punch down and let rise again 
until three times its size. Knead 



lightly and mold into loaves; let rise 
until a little more than double in 
size and bake. — Mrs. C. E. Stout.

The evening before baking scald 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of corn 
meal with half a cup of hot milk, 
making a thin batter, then add more 
corn meal (not scalded) to make as 
thick as mush. Cover closely and 
keep in a warm place over night. In 
the morning put one cup of milk in a 
one-gallon stone jar or large pitcher, 
add one teaspoonful of sugar and one 
teaspoonful of salt. Scald this with 
three cups of water heated to the 
boiling point. Reduce to a tempera- 
ture of 108 degrees with cold water, 
about two cups, using a thermometer 
to be sure. Then add flour and mix 
to a good batter, after which add the 
light corn meal. Beat well, cover the 
jar and put in a large kettle of wa- 
ter at a temperature of 108 degrees 
until the sponge rises, two or three 
hours. It should rise at least 1% 
inches. All flour to make a stiff 
dough, make into loaves and put in 
pans to rise, greasing them well on 
top. When quite light, bake about 
one hour. Do not let warmth get 
out of dough while working it. If 
less bread is wanted cool the scalded 
milk by setting it in a pan of cold 
water, having only the four cups of 
liquid, and allow about three cups of 
flour to a loaf. — Mrs. William Rees,

Perpetual Yeast Bread. 

Mrs. Welch says: Herewith are my 
standby recipes. The bread is far bet- 
ter than made with yeast cake, and 
the buns, muffins and cakes raised 
with the perpetual yeast have a de- 
liciousness all their own: 

Yeast. 

A two-quart preserving can is best 
to start and keep this in. Dissolve a 
compressed yeast cake in one-fourth 
cup of lukewarm potato water (that 
is the water in which potatoes for 
dinner were cooked.) Put in the can 
one pint of potato water and half a 
cup of sugar. When this is dissolved 
add the dissolved yeast, stir well and 
set in a warm place, but where it will 
not be heated perceptibly. Be sure 
not to cover till the whole is very 
light. Seal and set away till the day 
before you are ready to bake; then 



add another pint of lukewarm potato 
water and one-half cupful of sugar. 
Again let it rise till very light. Beat 
the yeast before using. After taking 
out for bread again seal and set away 
till the day before needed. 

Keep yeast very cool. If it gets 
sour you must begin again.

Scak yeast cakes in % c lukewarm

about 15 minutes. In the meantime, 
take potatoes and stir in enough po- 
tato water to make it about the con- 
sistency of a cake dough, add salt and 
sugar and stir well. Set aside till 
partly cool, when lukewarm add the 
water in which the yeast cakes have 
been dissolved, stir and set aside in 
a moderately warm place. This yeast 
will be ready to use in 48 hours, and 
can be used in 24 hours, though not 
so successfully. When making the 
bread, leave about a cupful of yeast 
for a "starter"; in this way the yeast 
cakes are used only when starting 
new yeast — about every three or four 
weeks it is necessary to do it, the 
yeast gets old and so doesn't make 
such good bread. Renew or add to 
the yeast at least ever day or oftener 
if necessary — this is important. In 
doing this it is not necessary to use

the 2 cups of potatoes, a half cup or 
a cup will be sufficient unless bread 
is made very often. Proceed in the 
same way as before; add potato water 
to potatoes and add nearly the full 
amount of sugar and salt, even if only 
a cup is used. Then when lukewarm 
add to "starter." I have found that if 
it is not done too often, it will keep 
the yeast fresh to just stir in 1 tea- 
spoonful salt and 1 tablespoonful su- 
gar. That keeps the yeast "working," 
but I do not do it unless I have plenty 
of yeast for baking and so do not 
want to add more potatoes. The 
secret of this bread is in the yeast, 
it must be kept fresh and "working" 
nearly all of the time.

To make bread. — Add 1 c water to 
1 pint of yeast and gradually stir in 
enough flour to make a batter that 
will just drop from a spoon. Stir well 
and set in a moderately warm place to 
raise until there are many little bub- 
bles on top of the sponge — about 45 
minutes. Then stir 1 c water in 
sponge, add salt, and enough flour to 
make a firm dough. Knead well for 
five minutes and again set aside to 
raise in a moderately warm place. 
Leave it until it is light; my method 
of testing it is to punch my finger in 
the dough; if it is elastic and starts 
to fill up the hole made, it is ready 
to make into loaves. It will take from 
45 minutes to an hour to do this. Then 
make out into three equal-sized 
loaves and let raise until nearly 
double the size— about 45 minutes. 
Bake in a moderate oven 45 minutes. 
In making six loaves of bread, it 
would not be necessary to add much 
more yeast (three cups would be 
plenty), but add more water. This is 
good bread, the beauty of it for me 
is that it takes such a short time to 
make it — only three or four hours 
from start to finish, an experienced 
bread baker can do it in three easily. 
It must be watched carefully, for it 
works fast and will not be good if let 
raise too long. The exact proportions 
of yeast and water are not so impor- 
tant as the way it is made. I use 
wood or kerosene stove in baking. I 
am not certain of the exact amount of 
flour used, but it is 2V Z quarts, I 
think.. 

This is a tested and tried recipe, as 
it has been used by one person for 12 
or 15 years. — Mrs. Fred Newton, Col- 
fax, Cal.

Recipe for the cheaper grades of 
white flour, not hard wheat. My 
flour cost $2.75 per sack. 

Cook three medium-sized potatoes 
in a half-gallon of water till potatoes 
are soft. Drain off the water into an- 
other vessel and mash potatoes well. 
Add 1-3 cup of sugar to the mashed 
potatoes and stir smooth, then add the 
potato water and set aside to cool. 
Soak iy 2 cakes yeast in Vz cup of 
warm water till soft. When potato 
water is cool add the yeast cakes, stir 
well and set aside till you are ready 
to make sponge. I make my potato 
water while cooking dinner, and leave 
it till after supper, then add enough 
flour to make a sponge, stirring and 
beating well. Then just before retir- 
ing I put remainder of flour in a dish 
pan or some large vessel, and add 1 
ounce of salt, 1 ounce of Crisco and 
work salt and Crisco into the flour 
very thoroughly. Then I add my 
sponge, which is by that time light. I 
mix with a spoon until too stiff to 
work, then use my hands. I make it 
rather stiff and work it till it runs 
all together, then take out of pan and 
work on the board till nice and 
spongy. Put back in the pan, grease 
top well and let set till morning. It 
is then light enough to put out on the 
board and work good again. It should 
not have to have any more flour 
added unless it sticks to the board, 
which mine seldom does. I then make 
out into 1-pound loaves and set aside 
about one hour and it is ready to 
bake. 

Bake 45 minutes in a moderately 
hot oven, covering with paper to keep 
from getting too brown. This makes 
ten 1-pound loaves of delicious bread. 

I see many recipes in The Evening 
Telegram, but none for the cheaper 
grades of flour. I use the cheaper 
grades and make just as nice bread 
as the hard wheat flour, so may be 
this will help some one else. — Mrs. E. 
V. Mills, 1527 Center street, Salem, Or. 

In regard to the soft flours — Mrs. 
Rorer says in her New Cook Book: 

"With our present system of milling

we are enabled to get from the hard 
spring wheat more gluten, muscle- 
building foods, than can be obtained 
from the soft winter wheats. As the 
price of flour is determined by the 
amount of gluten it contains, spring 
wheat flour is more expensive than 
the softer winter wheat flour. In the 
end, however, spring wheat is cheap- 
er, as a given weight produces a 
greater quantity of bread. It holds 
more water and requires different 
handling, but makes bread-making 
quite easy compared to the old soft 
flours. Most of the better grades of 
bread flours in common use are blend- 
ed spring and winter, and provided 
the blending is largely spring, the 
mixture is desirable. While soft flours 
are easily converted into hot breads, 
they cannot be made into good yeast 
'light breads.' So in buying cheap 
flour we must be sure to see that 
there is not too large a proportion of 
the soft wheat with little gluten, or 
our family will not get the body and 
muscle-building material they need 
from their bread."

with V2 cup of hot milk, making a 
thin batter, then add more corn meal 
(not scalded) to make as thick as 
mush. Cover closely and keep in a 
warm place over night. In the morn- 
ing put one cup of milk in a 1-gallon 
stone jar or large pitcher, add 1 tea- 
spoonful of sugar and 1 teaspoonful 
of salt. Scald this with 3 cups of 
water heated to the boiling point. 
Reduce to a temperature of 108 de- 
grees with cold water, about 2 cups, 
using a thermometer to be sure. Then 
add flour and mix to a good batter, 
after which add the light corn meal. 
Beat well, cover the jar and put in 
a large kettle of water at a tempera- 
ture of 108 degrees until the sponge 
rises, 2 or 3 hours. It should rise at 
least IY2 inches. Add flour to make a 
stiff dough, make into loaves and put 
in pans to rise, greasing them well on 
top. When quite light, bake about 1 
hour. Do not let warmth get out of 
dough while working it. If less bread

In the evening cook enough pota- 
toes for dinner and save the water. 
Use potatoes for dinner. Soak 1 
yeast cake in % cup lukewarm water 
Put in enough other water to make 2 
quarts. Put in 2 tablespoonfuls su- 
gar, 1 tablespoonful salt, 2 table- 
spoonfuls shortening and let it set un- 
til it works well. The next evening 
work in 9% quarts of flour and knead 
for fifteen minutes. Let rise all 
night, in the morning knead again 
and make into loaves. Let rise a 
little more than double the size and 
bake. 

Turn gas on full and let the bread 
cook till brown for 15 minutes, then 
turn down very low and cook 35 min- 
utes. 

Save a cupful of the yeast for the 
next time. You can bake from three 
to five batches of bread with one 
yeast cake. When your yeast doesn't 
work well, add Y2 of a yeast cake 
more. It makes your bread better to 
save a starter each time — Mrs. W. J.

Making and Baking Bread. 

Mrs. "W. R. Crow, 1153 Forty-ninth 
avenue Southeast, Portland, sends us 
these very exact and helpful direc- 
tions for making bread, and figures 
her prices out in fractions, with a 
trifle different price than we pay on 
the market. These price comparisons 
are helpful. 

In sending in my recipes I am giv- 
ing as near as I can what years of 
experience has taught me and have 
figured my recipes as closely as pos- 



sible, though one may substitute 
cheaper shortening if desired. In bak- 
ing bread it is better to choose an 
ironing or other day at home, making 
the bread all in one day, but the 
sponge may be set the night before. 
More depends on the mixing for suc- 
cess than any other one thing, as dif- 
ferent flours require different 
amounts of moisture. Keeping the 
sponge or dough too warm makes a 
light but coarse-grained bread, too 
cool, it is apt to be dark and heavy. 
Keep the sponge just a bit warmer 
than blood heat. A good mixing rule 
is to mix the sponge almost, but not 
quite thick enough to leave the spoon 
tracks. In mixing stiff, if not an ex- 
perienced baker, take a mixing spoon; 
now sift in flour, a cupful at a time, 
mixing thoroughly each time until 
the dough is so stiff it leaves the pan 
in an ungainly ball. You may think 
it too soft, but thickly flour your 
board, turn out the dough, now thick- 
ly flour the hands, and lightly press 
and pull the dough into shape by put- 
ting the hands on the dough against 
the board, and bringing up and over 
from all sides. Do this till the dough 
can be kneaded. Now knead thor- 
oughly, pressing lightly downward 
and outward with a rolling motion al- 
ways. These directions apply to all 
bread and small breads of yeast.

Six loaves of bread cost $0.3885 

One loaf of bread will cost $0.0648. 

Process of making: Cook potato 
well done, mash fine, add 1 table- 
spoonful salt, 1 quart warm water, 
flour to make good medium batter 
and beat hard. Dissolve one yeast 
cake in % cupful water, add to bat- 
ter and beat again. Set in warm 
place, free from draft, until very 
light. Now add the melted lard and 
sugar (you may have to add more 
warm water to absorb the remaining 
flour) ; add flour as directed above, 
and knead thoroughly. Let rise to 
double the bulk, knead down again, 
using no flour (oil or grease the 
hands). When well risen again mold 
into loaves, put into well-greased 
pans, let rise two-thirds its bulk and 
bake 45 minutes. 

War Bread Costs 6% Cents Per Loaf. 

For a small family one-half the 
above recipe should be used, or divide 
the sponge into three parts; to one 
part knead up and make white bread,

Whole Wheat Bread. 

Mrs. John Oatfield, Milwaukie, Or., 
sends us this recipe and says: "The 
fuel used Is fir cordwood in malleable 
Steel range. As I never build a spe- 
cial fire, I could hardly determine 
cost. Filling the firebox just before I 
put the bread in the oven, with pos- 
sibly one or two small pieces of wood 
added at the last period of baking, is 
all the heat required. I think the in- 
formation you are compiling for your 
readers is wonderful. I assure you I 
appreciate it as well as enjoy reading 
it." 

In regard to the wood, we men- 
tioned as the great saving in using 
wood that you could use the heat for 
so many things at once; but in order 
to have a standard of comparison we 
must figure in the cost of fuel as 
given in the fuel tables, with the un- 
derstanding that it will be cheaper if 
cooked with other things.

(strained through finest mesh sieve). 



When lukewarm add yeast and liquid 
and stir in enough white flour to 
make a stiff batter, beat well, set in 
warm place until bedtime. 

2. At night add 1 cup warm water 
and enough whole wheat flour to 
make batter slightly stiffer than 
yeast, using for yeast 1 pound 5 
ounces of flour in all. 

3. In morning add 1 cup warm wa- 
ter, 2 rounded tablespoonfuls sugar, 1 
rounded tablespoonful lard and 1 
scant level tablespoonful salt and 
enough whole wheat flour to knead 
on board. Knead 10 minutes. Place 
in greased bowl and let rise until 
double (light), mold into loaves, turn 
loaves in melted lard in individual 
bread pans, let rise double, bake 50 
minutes. This quantity makes three 
large loaves and sometimes four, 
varying with the flour. I use Wil- 
lamette valley grown whole wheat 
flour, so this is a Western recipe. 

Flour used for whole wheat bread: 
Yeast (white) flour, 1 lb. 5 oz. (4 

cups). 

Sponge whole wheat, 1 lb. 4 oz. (4 

cups) flour. 

Bread flour, 2 lbs (6 cups). 

Kneading on board, white flour, % 
lb. (1 cup). 

Total — White flour, 1 lb. 13 oz.; 
whole wheat, 3 lbs. 4 oz.; total, 5 lbs. 
1 oz. 

Bread, finished, 4 large loaves — 
Weight, 1% to 2 lbs. each; circumfer- 
ence, length, 26 inches; circumference, 
breadth, 16 inches. — Mrs. John Oat-

two-pound greased baking powder 
cans about two-thirds full of dough. 
Put on covers and place in rack in

one-half way up sides of the cans and 
put cover on kettle. Bring to a boil 
on medium burner, place on simmer-

kettle, remove lids and place in oven 
to dry out. This amount will make 
1% pounds of bread. The amount of

Oatmeal Bread. 

Cost. 

1 pt. rolled oats $0.0328

1 yeast cake 0083 

Fuel top gas 45 min., oven gas 

45 minutes 0305 

Cost (beside whole wheat 

flour) $0.1254 

Put the water over the fire, and 
when boiling stir in hastily the oat- 
meal. Stir until the mixture thickens, 
and then stand it in the double boil- 
er, where it will cook slowly for 30 
minutes. Take it from the fire, add 
the milk, the salt, and when luke- 
warm, the yeast cake dissolved in a 
cupful of cold water. Add slowly, 
stirring all the while, sufficient 
whole wheat flour to make a dough. 
This bread is better if a little moist. 
It must be stirred and beaten rather 
than kneaded on a board. When it is 
too stiff to drop from the spoon, 
scrape down the sides of the bowl, 
cover and stand in a warm place for 
3 hours. Then add just a little more 
flour, mix again, and pour into 3 
greased square pans. Stand in the 
warm place for 1 hour more. Bake 
in a moderate oven for three quarters 
of an hour. — Mrs. S. T. R. 

(The friend who sent this recipe In 
did not measure her whole wheat 
flour, so we cannot get the total cost 
of the bread, or be so sure in making 
it, as though we knew just exactly 
how much flour she put in. However, 
it is too valuable a recipe to lose. It 
is certainly most wholesome, and it 
sounds good. Let us try it.)

until the mixture beging to thicken, 
take from the fire, add the yolks of 
the eggs, one at a time, stirring all 
the while, then fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites, and pour the mix- 
ture into a greased shallow baking 
pan, the bottom of which has been 
covered with chopped dates. The 
whole should not be over a half inch 
in thickness. Bake in a moderate 
oven for a half hour. This is one of 
the most delicious of the quick 
breads, and is easily digested and 
wholesome if properly made. It must 
be crisp on top and not over % of an 
inch in thickness when done. It may 
be used as a bread, or dessert at 
lunch. It is very palatable and whole- 
some served with milk or cream. —

the baking board and roll to a sheet 
a quarter of an inch thick. Cut with 
a round cutter, and bake on a greased 
griddle gradually and put it to one 
side of the stove where the scones 
will bake slowly. If sticky, you have 
not added sufficient flour; if dry, too 
much. Be careful not to get in too 
much flour, or the scones will not be 
light. If the batter is too thin to 
roll, drop them by spoonfuls on the 
griddle. — Mrs. S. T. R.

THE CONSERVATION OF BREAD 
CRUMBS. 

In a recent Ladies' Home Journal, 
Mrs. Anna B. Scott gave some good 
advice on saving every crumb, from 
which we quote: 

"It doesn't sound reasonable, does 
it? The bare words, 'a crust of bread,' 
call to our minds a picture of the 
verge of starvation. Literature speaks 
of crusts of bread as the extreme low- 
est limit in the scale of foods. And so 
we have come to regard these crusts 
as something rather to be despised In 
the economy of the household. 

"And stale bread! It is scarcely 
more highly regarded. Everybody de- 
mands fresh bread, and there is noth- 
ing but pity for the person who must 
use stale bread for the sake of his 
stomach. 

"Crumbs too? Why, crumbs are 
mere debris in 90 per cent of the 
kitchens. Did you ever think to save 
the crumbs from the bread board? 
There are housekeepers who would be 
ashamed to be caught in the act of 
conserving these tiny crumbs! 

"Now think of the economy that 
would result from the utilization of 
these crusts and crumbs and the stale 
bread. A statistician probably would 
figure it out away up in the millions 
per annum for the United States, but 
you can figure it out yourself in your 
own household. 

"In these days when the cost of food 
is getting higher every day, every 
little bit counts — even the crumbs — 
and so following are a few recipes for 
their uses in this wartime." 

And then gives seven recipes for 
using up bread crumbs economically. 
Two of these recipes come within the 
scone of our work this week, and we 
will analyze them to see Just how- 
economical they are — the first is:

The number of fritters this makes 
is not given, but the ingredients 
would make about one dozen gems or 
muffins if baked that way. So we find 
a total cost here of about 19 cents 
for a food value of one dozen muffins 
— and done in the name of economy, 
to save exactly 1% cents worth of 
bread crumbs and crusts. Here are 
the directions: 

Cover the dry bread with cold 
water for 10 minutes; press between 
the hands until dry; put into a bowl 
with the milk, rice stock, salt and the 
egg well beaten; mix well, then sift 
the flour and baking powder in and 
mix lightly. Bake on a well-greased 
hot griddle, making the fritters about 
the size of a fried oyster. Sprinkle 
with sugar and cinnamon or serve 
with jelly or fruit butter. 

Bread Crumb Muffins. 

Cost. 
She also gives this recipe: 
1 c flour $0.0141 

1 c bread crumbs 0150 

1% cup milk 0468 

2 eggs 0800 

1 T melted butter 0156 

1 t baking powder 0107 

Ms t salt 0002 

1 t butter for greasing tin 0032 

Gas for baking 20 minutes 0190 

Total cost of 20 $0.2046 

Cost per dozen, 13 cents. 

Soak the bread crumbs in the cold 
milk for ten minutes; add the sifted 
flour, baking powder and salt, the 
eggs, well beaten, and the butter; 
mix well. Heat the muffin tins, brush 
with a little butter and put one ta- 
blespoonful of mixture into each tin. 
Bake for from 20 to 25 minutes in a 
hot oven. 

Again the number the recipe makes 
is not given, but we have here the 
same flour and crumbs, but 1% as 
much liquid as in the preceding 
recipe. The one extra egg will thick- 
en this and give us more bulk, so we 
will say that this recipe makes about 
20 muffins. Thirteen cents per dozen 
is not bad for muffins, but can hard- 
ly be called economical as a bread 
substitute, as they do not take the 
place of over one-half a loaf of 
toasted bread, or 3 cents in value, 
and in doing this we only save 1 
cup or 4 ounces, or % pound of 
bread, or a value of 1% cents at 6 
cents per loaf, which our economic- 
ally made home-made bread averages. 
Muffins that cost even 13 cents per 
dozen are not an economy. We are 
getting some surprising results in our 
accurate figuring of all these recipes. 
One thing that we cannot help facing 
and acknowledging is that, at pres- 
ent, patriotism and the family living 
expenses need adjustment on the 
question of bread economy. 

Our government wants us to use 



less flour, to substitute something 
else for flour, but our family incomes 
hardly meet the cost of the present 
prices of food, and we find that each 
and every substitute we can use in 
making bread, rolls, etc., costs more 
than wheat, except cooked rolled oats 
costing $0.0049 per cup and cooked 
corn meal costing $0.0074 per cup, 
both of which absorb so much water 
that they are rendered about half the 
price of flour as a substitute. 

We are hoping that the government 
will soon take charge of these flour 
substitutes, .especially corn meal and 
rye or barley, and fix a lower price. 
It seems to me if one substitute were 
decided upon and the price arbitrarily 
lowered, so that every one would use 
that one, the demand for it would be 
so great that the increased quantity 
used would lower the price of produc- 
tion so that the mills would make a 
good profit. 

Saving Bread Crumbs. 

In regard to saving bread crumbs. 
The first and best suggestion I can 
make is not to have any. Eat all 
your bread up as you go along. Any 
little crumbs that accumulate from 
cutting and crumbling can .be put at 
once into the soup or into the pota- 
toes you are frying, etc., and kept 
used up from meal to meal. An ex- 
cellent suggestion along this line is 
an answer Mr. Hoover made to a lady 
who asked him: "How can I, in any 
way, save white flour in my small 
household?" He said: 

"An easy way to save flour is in 
the way you serve bread. Cut at the 
table, slice by slice, as it is wanted. 
Save the uneaten ends of the loaf, 
convert into crumbs and use them in 
puddings, breakfast cakes and muf- 
fins." 

But there is no use of there being 
uneaten ends of fresh bread. The 
crust of bread is the best and most 
wholesome part, and the eating of it 
is simply a matter of habit. I under- 
stand that one great reason we have 
so increasingly much need of dentists 
is that we are really getting too lazy 
to bite and chew solid food. (When 
you really come to think of that, 
what expresses our feeling so well as 
the current slang, "Isn't that the 
limit" of laziness.) 

But sometimes a little stale bread 
gets ahead of some of us, and then 
the best way I know of is to roll or 
grind it fine, dry thoroughly and put 
in a covered can, and it will keep in- 
definitely for escalloped dishes, roll- 
ing meats, dressings, etc. I never 
have half enough on hand. 

Here are some suggestions from a 
visitor to our kitchen that seem to 
me far more economical and practi- 



WAR BREADS.

cally useful than anything I have 
seen in the magizines: 

It is a good plan to save all pieces 
of left-over bread, etc., in two paper 
bags, white bread in one and cake, 
toast, doughnuts and brown bread in 
the other. These may be dried in the 
oven, then run through the food 
chopper and put away in covered 
tins till wanted. 

The light colored crumbs may be 
used for souffles and light puddings, 
and the dark crumbs for spice pud- 
dings and brown bread. A few bread 
crumbs added to leftovers, when mak- 
ing them into croquettes, increase 
their lightness and bulk, and if sifted 
the fine ones cannot be excelled for 
rolling the croquettes. They may also 
be used for rolling oysters and clams 
for frying, and also to make a nice 
brown crust on top of any of the vari- 
ous scalloped dishes, or on boiled ham. 

When eggs are high and scrambled 
eggs are wanted, bread crumbs again 
come to the rescue; here they add 
lightness and quality without detract- 
ing from the flavor or quality of the 
dish. 

In cooking this popular dish, use 
fewer eggs and a little more milk, 
and as soon as the eggs are set use 
up the excess moisture with finely 
crumbled centers of stale bread. Do 
not use crusts or heels. The presence 
of the bread in this dish can hardly be 
detected. — Amy B. Westbrook, 1540 
Salem avenue, Albany, Or. 

In regard to the last suggestion, 
I have used this recipe for years and 
it is excellent: 4 eggs, 1 cup sweet 
milk, 1 cup fine bread crumbs, % t 
salt, pepper or other seasoning to 
taste. Stir smooth and cook in 
shortening in the spider, like scram- 
bled eggs. — Aunt Prudence. 

Economy in Wartime. 

Is the title of a little English book 
from which we quote: 

"The food problem is becoming 
more and more serious every day, as 
we hear of prices mounting up. The 
men of England are fighting for their 
country's honor, our glorious navy is 
guarding the seas, but there is an- 
other battle which has to be fought 
by those who remain at home — they 
too must be fighting by helping to 
keep the food supply going. And this 
is a fight in which the women of Eng- 
land must take a very large share, 
for they are the housekeepers of the 
English nation — and to a great extent 
they are the guardians of the nation's 
food." 

Women of America — does not this 
sound like a call to arms? Can we 
not rally, as the German women and 
the French women, and the English 
women have done, and do the one 
thing our country is calling on us to 



do — in conserving the food supply of 
our own loved land. If we never 
thought much about economy before, 
let us begin to think — and act — now, 
today. As a homely and practical ex- 
ample of what we can do, let's begin 
with some recipes for griddle canes 
that were sent in recently. I'll omit 
the name of the sender, but I know 
she is a kind and intelligent lady who 
was trying to be helpful to other 
women by sending these recipes, and 
they will be very helpful to all if 
they cause us to subject our own 
recipes to close scrutiny to see 
whether they cost exorbitantly. I am 
perfectly sure that this lady had no 
idea that hers do. Here is her recipe 
for —

Your sour milk may be thick or 
thin^that will make a difference in 
the flour you will need — and your 
family may like delicate, thin pan- 
cakes or hearty thick ones, which will 
also make a difference in the amount 
of flour needed. You can use any 
flour, buckwheat, whole "wheat, gra- 
ham, cornmeal, white flour, etc., or, 
what I always use, a combination of 
various flours and leftovers, soaked 
bread crumbs, cold pancakes left from 
yesterday soaked up in hot water and 
mashed fine; the rinsings of the mo- 
lasses cup or syrup pitcher; the scrap- 
ings from the bread board, an extra 
egg yolk, the little dab of oatmeal left 
from breakfast, the mashed cold 
mush, a broken cookie or piece of 
sponge cake, a few tablespoonfuls of 
milk — the enumeration is endless, just 
what you happen to have left over in 
the line of breads or meals or sugars 
or milks of any kind. The "trick" is 
— and it is a trick that can only be 
learned by practice — it is in adding 
just the right amount of perfectly 
dissolved soda, no more, no less. No 
recipe can give this, for it depends on 
how sour your milk was to begin 
with, and how much it has soured by 
being in a warm or cool place since 
your pancakes were mixed. As many 
years as I have made pancakes I 
never bake them at any time without 
putting in a little soda, and baking a 
little to try, and adding more as 
needed, etc. It is a "cut and try" 
method and somewhat tedious, but I 
don't see how you can make perfect 
pancakes without. Perhaps right 
here is the reason so many women 
use baking powder and eggs — it is so 
much easier, and they are so busy; 
but that is our business just now, to 
take the longer and more painstaking 
road if it is the road to economy. 

Another thing, be sure to "set" your 
cakes the night before, and beat them 
thoroughly, and they are more appe- 
tizing to be a little salt. Don't let 
them get very cold in winter, and 
warm the batter a little before you 
start baking. I know I'm saying too 
much about so simple a thing, but so 
few women seem to know how to 
make good and economical pancakes, 
and it is these little things that count. 

If you haven't the sour milk or but- 
termilk, and don't care to buy it, you 
can "set" your cakes just as well with 
half a yeast cake in warm water and 
flour, etc. They won't be very good 
till the second morning, but are near- 
ly as good as the others after that. — 
Aunt Prudence.

The Soups Our Ancestors Made 



Dear Friends: A few days ago I 
came across a quaint little book 
called "With a Saucepan Over the 
Sea," made up of the origin and his- 
tory of much of our cooking, and it 
is so interesting I am going to copy 
a little of it today, and a few soups, 
centuries old, which I will not try to 
figure out in costs, as their interest 
to us is not in the cost, but in the 
antiquity of the recipes. 

The author says: "Kings and 
queens, brave and fair, have supped 
on these, or have gone to battle or 
execution, thus and so. Starving 
peasants, lending glory to monarchy, 
through taxation and service, have 
invented certain soups and ragouts to 
eke out a sad and miserable life. 
Some dishes are peculiar to countries 
as a whole, their origin being ob- 
scure, although each was once known 
to a city or village or even a family, 
who kept it inviolate for centuries, 
and old housewives with manuscript 
books cherish recipes transmitted 
through generations. 

"To anyone fond of good cooking 
it is fascinating to see what Marie 
Stuart, Napoleon, Marie de Medici, 
Louis XIV, Henry of Navarre, or Joan 
of Arc, ate. For what we eat we be- 
come; and food forms faces, even aa 
the prevalent fashions of thought or 
dress mold the features and charac- 
ter." 

(This last is interesting to consider 
— but the facts are that people who 
eat the same food are totally dissim- 
ilar. Yet perhaps the national pre- 
eminence of certain dishes dees influ- 
ence the national characteristics of 
people — or even of localities. Do you 
suppose that Boston baked beans can 
be what makes the people of Boston 
so superlatively wise — or do they get 
from them their peculiar accent? In 
regard to the last statement quoted 
from the book, I think we older peo- 
ple have all realized during the last 
six or seven years that the prevailing 
fashions in dress were influencing the 
character of our young girls, and con- 
sequently the boys as well — but I 
promised never to talk about the 
fashions, so we will return to these 
quaint old soups.) 

Cocka Leekle (Scotland). 

This is the oldest recipe known, as 
it dates back to the 14th century. 
Wash and trim one dozen leeks, cut 
them in pieces half an inch long, dis- 
carding roots and tops; then fry them 
in one ounce of butter, with two 
stalks of celery and one carrot, cut 
fine. When brown, but not burnt, add 
1% cups of chicken broth and one cup 
of cooked chicken, cut into dice. Sim- 



mer, covered, two hours; then add 
salt, pepper and yolk of an egg, 
blended with a little of the broth, 
first, before adding to the soup. 

Queen Sonp. 

This is said to have been invented 
for Marie Stuart by the royal cook 
when she lived in France as dauphi- 
ness. It was a favorite with both 
Victoria and Napoleon Bonaparte. 
Cook 2 large onions with 2 pieces of 
celery, both cut up, in 2 ounces of 
butter. Add some parsley, thyme, and 
a bay leaf, 1 chicken cut into joints, 
and 2 quarts of water. Simmer for 4 
hours. Take out the chicken, cut the 
meat off the wings and breast into 
dice, and keep the dark meat for cro- 
quettes or salad. Chop 1 dozen 
blanched almonds, the yolks of 2 hard 
boiled eggs and 2 slices of bread 
soaked in milk. Pound these with the 
meat and press through a sieve; add 
to the soup, strained, 1 cup of boiling 
cream or rich milk, salt, pepper and 
nutmeg. Serve at once, hot. 

Sonp Bonne Feninie (Provincial 
France). 

This is the broth of the farmer and 
peasant's wife, wholesome and nour- 
ishing. Wash, dry and cut up 2 large 
lettuces, 1 pound of sorrel and 1 pound 
of spinach. Add 1% quarts of good 
white stock and simmer, with % 
pound of butter, 2 onions and 2 car- 
rots, for one hour. • Add a blending of 
1 ounce of butter, 1 ounce of flour, 
the yolks of 2 eggs and a cup of boil- 
ing milk, salt and pepper. Press 
through a sieve and serve with crou- 
tons. 

Liver Soup (Poland). 

Cut % pound of liver into slices, 
add a spoonful of flour, 1 ounce of 
butler and 1 onion, cut fine. Fry this 
and then pound it, add three slices of 
stale bread, in crumbs, salt and pep- 
per and three pints of brown stock. 
Boil 20 minutes, press through a 
sieve, add yolk of 1 egg and some 
chopped parsley, and serve at once. 
Calf's Head Soup (Recipe of the Hotel 
Star and Garter, Richmond, England). 

Parboil and bone a calf's head. Put 
the bones and the meat, cut up, in 4 
quarts of water with 1 ounce of flour, 
salt, pepper, a bay leaf, some parsley, 
a clove, 1 carrot and 1 onion. Cook 
four hours, take out the bones, cut 
the meat into dice, strain the soup, 
and the meat, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 
sliced, 1 dozen poached force-meat 
balls, made of some meat, bread 
crumbs, herbs and egg, and 1 lemon, 
cut in slices. Serve at once, hot.

Pepper Pot. 

This dish is peculiar to Spain, but 
it was imported to Jamaica, whence 
the negroes took the recipe north. In 
Philadelphia there are several small 
restaurants, kept by darkies who are 
famous for pepper pot. 

To 3 quarts of water add 1 pint of 
vegetables, cut up, any kinds, mixed, 
you happen to have, in equal parts, 
using beans, peas, celery, carroty, on- 
ions, rice, lettuce, etc., also potatoes; 
add 1 pound of mutton, 1 pound of 
salt pork and 1 pound of honeycomb 
tripe, cut up and fried in butter or 
suet, .1 bay leaf, 1 clove, parsley, 
thyme and sweet marjoram. Cook, 
closely covered, three hours. Set aside 
to cool, remove the fat, thicken with 
flour and butter and yolk of an egg, 
add salt and pepper, and serve very 
hot. 

Lenten Broth (as Made in the Con- 
vents of France and Austria). 

Cook 2 pounds of flounders or any 
white fish, cut up, with 1 carrot, 1 
onion, 1 turnip, 2 pieces of celery and 
a bunch of herbs, with 1 quart of wa- 
ter, for 2 hours. Take out the fish, 
remove skin and bones and put the 
fish back again, add 1 pint of boiling

Making Soups Now 



Some simple fundamental directions 
for soup making in general may be 
acceptable to some of the younger 
housekeepers. Nothing is more eco- 
nomical and nourishing than good 
soup, and it is so easy to make if a 
very few underlying principles are 
understood. 

First the utensils: The juices of 
meat are acid, hence it is not desir- 
able to use either a tin or an iron 
kettle. Granite or aluminum is best. 
It should be large enough to allow 
boiling and skimming and have a 
tight-fitting cover. 

Clear soup is strained through a 
colander, then through a fine wire 
sieve, then through double cheese 
cloth, if desired. 

Always use cold salted water, and 
let the meat soak to extract the juice; 



heat and cook very slowly for the 
same reason. 

Much nourishment is left in the 
meat after all the juices are extracted 
and it should always be chopped or 
ground and used for hash, curries, 
meat balls, pressed meats, etc. 

In skimming the soup stock you 
skim off the coagulated albumin, 
which has a food value and is lost. 
This is to make the soup clear and 
is done for looks only. The albumin 
is as clean and good as any other part 
of the soup, and is used in all but the 
clear soups. 

Soups may be classified as: First, 
those containing considerable nour- 
ishment, as thick milk soups; second, 
the clear soups containing vegetables, 
moderately nourishing; third, the thin 
clear soups, containing the stimulat- 
ing elements of the beef; without 



MAKING SOUP STOCK. 



nourishment, as stock, consomme, 
bouillon, and, fourth, the cold fruit 
soups, used only in the summer at 
the beginning- of a luncheon; but 
these are rather heavy and unhy- 
gienic, and little used by ordinary 
housewives. The perfectly clear soups 
and those containing bits of vege- 
tables are fashionably used for din- 
ner .soups, while the milk, or so- 
called "cream" soups are more often 
used for luncheon or supper where 
their nourishment is a decided factor 
of the meal while soup that begins a 



dinner, of course, is not expected to 
contain as much nourishment. 

Mrs. Rorer says: 

"A clear soup is made either from 
fresh meat or from the bones from 
cooked meats. The latter method is 
recommended to those who wish to 
live well and economically." 

Bouillon is a light, clear soup served 
in cups at the beginning of a lunch- 
eon. 

Consomme is the most expensive 
and most tasty of all clear soups; it 
is always used as a dinner soup. 



Making Soup Stock 



Soup stock is called "the founda- 
tion of all clear soups, and the very 
life and essence of all meat sauces." 
To make a perfectly clear stock use a 
shin of beef, meat and bone in pro- 
portion of one pound of meat to half 
a pound of bone. Wipe it carefully 
with a damp cloth; cut the meat from 
the bone and then into small blocks 
or pieces. Put into the stock kettle 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one 
sliced onion; stir over a hot fire until 
the onion and sugar brown and burn. 
Throw in the meat, keeping the ket- 
tle still quite hot; shake and stir the 
meat until it seems slightly scorched, 
then add the bones that have been 
well cracked, and five quarts of cold 
water; cover the kettle, bring slowly 
to boiling point and skim. Push the 
kettle now over a moderate fire where 
it will just bubble, not boil, for three 
hours. At the end of this time add 
one onion, into which you have stuck 
12 whole cloves, a bay leaf, a sliced 
carrot, a few green tops of celery or 
a half teaspoonful of celery seed, and 
a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover and 
simmer gently for another hour. 
These vegetables may be saved and 
used for puree. A wire vegetable ball 
is a convenience. Now strain the 
stock and set it aside to cool. When 
cold remove every portion of fat from 
the surface, and it is ready for use. 
If carefully made this will be clear, 
brown, transparent, and when cold a 
thick jelly. The meat that is strained- 
from the stock must not be thrown 
away, but put aside for making 
pressed meats, meat balls, etc. 

Stock for Consomme. 

This is made same as above except 
that a shin of beef and a "knuckle" 
or shin of veal are both used, and 
treated same as given for stock. 

White Stock. 

This is a term given to stock made 
from veal or chicken alone. The 
bones of roasted veal may .be used, 
with cracked chicken bones, or a fowl 
and knuckle of veal may be purchased 
for a large entertainment. 



Stock from Beef and Chicken. 

This is one of the finest of all 
stocks. Purchase a fowl that can be 
used as a boiled fowl for dinner; draw 
and truss. Put the sugar and onion 
into the kettle as directed for stock. 
Cut the meat from the shin of beef 
into blocks; put it into the kettle un- 
til seared; then add the bones. 

Arrange the chicken so that it will 
rest on these bones, add five quarts of 
cold water, bring to boiling point and 
skim. Simmer gently until the. chick- 
en is tender, then take it out for use. 
Continue cooking the stock for at 
least three hours; season and finish 
as in stock recipe. 

Stock from Bones. 

The economical housewife saves 
every bone left from the center of. 
steaks, the bones from roasts, the 
carcasses of poultry and the liquid 
in which they have been boiled for 
the usual household stock for every- 
day soups. Crack all bones, cover 
with cold water and simmer gently 
for four hours. At the first boil, 
skim; at the end of the third hour 
add the flavorings as in plain stock. 
Select ironing or baking days for 
making stock when you use a wood 
stove to utilize heat. Stock may be 
kept in summer four or five days; 
in winter 10 to 12 days. The greatest 
essentials to keeping stock are: First, 
the removal of the fat; second, it 
must be cooled quickly after it is 
made. It will keep longer if vege- 
table flavorings are omitted, adding 
salt and pepper only. 

Bay Leaves. 

I wonder how many people know 
that bay leaves, so universally used 
in soup and in other seasoning, grow 
luxuriantly in Oregon. Reference 
books give the bay tree as growing 
in the United States only in some of 
the southern states, but the bay 
leaves I am using now I picked on 
the banks of the Rogue river, where 
literally thousands of these trees 
"flourish like a green bay tree." But 
it is only out in the Galice country, 
15 miles west of Grants Pass.

I believe we have a collection of 
soups and stews that would be hard 
to equal anywhere for low price, real 
nourishment and general attractive- 
ness. When we can have a good stew 
for 2V2 to 6 cents per cupful, and a 
good soup for from less than 1 cent 
to 3 cents a soup plate (cupful) we 
don't need to tremble quite so much 
at the "high cost of living." Add to 
this our good, nourishing bread at 5^4 
cents per lb. (or lower — down to 2 or 
3 cents per loaf) and nobody will need 
to go hungry — war or no war. 

Of course these recipes cannot be 
absolutely mathematically correct — 
that is not possible, but we can get 
them so near the real cost that we 
have a basis of comparison and a cer- 
tain knowledge of whether we are 
cooking simple, nourishing, inexpen- 
sive dishes, or whether our food costs 
more than is really necessary or de- 
sirable for the health of our family.

The One-Piece Meal. 

Christine Frederick, in a recent 
Ladies' Home Journal, exactly ex- 
presses the idea of our work thi* 
week. She says in part: 

I want to bring the attention of 
my country women who are house- 
wives to the idea of having more 
frequently what I call the one-piece 
meal, and by so doing save three 
things — nutriment, expense and labor. 

A typical meal in American homes 
consists of a separate dish of meat, 
with gravy in separate bowl; pota- 
toes, served separately; then a vege- 
table or two, also separate, and per- 
haps a salad; and last a dessert, 
which may consist of more than ona 
food. The meat has its own gravy, 
the vegetables have their own sauces. 

In cooking such a meal it is almost 
invariably the custom to throw away 
all the water in which each vege- 
table was cooked, and to serve the 
vegetables plain, or with melted but- 
ter, or with a sauce which again re- 
quires more ingredients to make the 
food tasty, which would not have 
been necessary if, in the first place, 
the vegetables had been combined 
with the fat and flavor of the meat. 

The real "one-piece" stands su- 
preme in its handling of cheap cuts, 
in the combination and flavoring of 
its vegetables and gravy into one co- 
herent whole. The "one-piece" also 
proves its economy by utilizing starch 
in such a way that little bread is de- 
sired, or little butter or additional fat 
needed in addition to the fat and 
gravy already supplied. The ideal 
"topping-off" of such meals is fruit 
in simple form, canned, stewed or 
fresh. 

The national and most famous 
dishes of practically every country 
are a combination of several foods, 
cooked and served together. From 
France we have the ragout or the 
pot-au-feu; from China, chop suey; 
from Austria, goulash; from India, 
curries; from Italy, the spaghetti and 
gnocci; from Germany, the spatzen 
dishes; from Russia its borsch, which 
is a soup so hearty that it is the main 
dish of the meal. Indeed, even Amer- 
ica had its New England "boiled din- 
ner" and its Southern chicken-pepper- 
rice dishes still more attractive, both 
"one-piece" in idea. 

Many other dishes could be men- 
tioned, such as the noodle dishes and 
spatzen dishes of many countries. It 
is significant that two countries as 
widely separated as Germany and 
China should have developed and used 
the noodle — chow main — as a daily 
dish. 

The preparation of the "one-piece" 
meal uses possibly two pots and one 



platter as against five pots and five 
serving dishes besides individual 
serving dishes in the preparation of 
the conventional dinner. Why not, 
then, for all these reasons, incorpo- 
rate it into our weekly menu? 

These few examples of typical one- 
piece foreign dishes may serve to re- 
vive or inspire the creation of more 
strictly American dishes on this or- 
der. 

Indian Curry. 
Is a dish which can utilize left- 
overs of mutton or chicken, but 
which is better made from the fresh 
meat in this manner: 

Cost. 
2 lbs. neck or shoulder of mut- 
ton (He lb.), cut into iy 2 - 

inch strips $0.2200 

2 T melted butter 0312 

2 small onions 0032 

2 T grated cocoanut (4 oz, 10c) .0125 

2 large apples thinly sliced 0500 

2 T flour 0018 

1 t salt 0003 

V2 t white pepper 0042 

1 saltspoonful grated nutmeg. v .0032 
1 t curry powder, scant (4 oz. 

for 25c) 0101 

1 qt. mutton broth, strained 

(use water) - 0000 

4 oz. uncooked rice 0131 

Gas — y 2 hour medium. . .$0,010 

1 hour simmering 004 

.0140 

Cost for 6 persons $0.3633 

Cost per portion, 6 cents. 

First slice the onion and brown it 
in fat; add the meat, and brown, dust- 
ing with flour. Place in a casserole, 
and add the cocoanut, apple, stock 
and seasoning. The curry powder 
could be mixed separately in a small 
cupful of the hot broth before adding. 
Cook for 15 minutes. Uncover and 
add the rice. Simmer either on the 
back of the stove or in the oven for 
another hour. There should be no 
floating gravy, merely rich moisture. 
If preferred, the rice may be cooked 
separately and merely served around 
the curry. This will serve six. The 
approximate cost is 60 cents. 

Chop Suey. 

Is liked by many, and would be 
more popular if its ingredients were 
more widely known, and it is very 
simple to make.

Plain Chop Suey. 

(This recipe came from the Chinese.) 

Pork, sliced and cooked in peanuc 
oil until almost done. Then put the 
following vegetables into the same 
pan and oil: Bamboo shoots, Chinese 
black mushrooms, bean sprouts and 
Chinese soy made from soy beans. 
Cook meat and vegetables together 
Serve with gravy made of flour, soy 
and flavored with ginger juice. A 
little sugar is added. 

Chop suey is not a native Chinese 
dish and is unknown in China. It was 
invented by a Mexican. Chop means 
miscellaneous. The foregoing recipe 
is the plain dish. Chicken meat is 
used for the more fancy styles and 
"Mandarin style" has even mor^. 
frills. 

Goulash. 

Is typical of many meat dishes of 
the "one-piece" type:

Brown well; then add flour and turn. 
Add the tomato sauce, the meat, and 
enough boiling water to cover. Tie 
the spices in a cheesecloth square 
and add. Cover the pan and let cook 
very slowly for about half an hour 
Now add the potatoes and carrots and 
the chopped parsley and garlic, stir- 
ring well. Continue simmering for 
another half hour. Remove the 
spices. Serve very hot, dusting a lit- 
tle paprika on top if liked. Serves 
six persons; the approximate present 
cost is 70 cents.

Makes about 4 quarts for. . . .$0.5346 
Or 1 quart for 13 l-3c or 3 l-3c per 
cupful, or average "portion." 

Cut about two pounds of flank 
steak into small squares and an onion 
into pieces, and cook both in a pan 
with a little butter a few moments, 
tut not long enough to take mucli 
color. Place a layer of the meat in a 
flat-bottomed kettle of good size. 
Over this put a layer of the onions : 
and so on until all the meat is used 
and as many onions as desired. Add 
enough cold water to cover the upper 
layer of meat. Put over the fire and 
bring to a boil. Allow two cupfuls of 
canned or sliced tomatoes to each 
quart of the meat and onion mixturc- 
and when they have reached the boil- 
ing point (on no account before), pour 
the tomatoes over the mixture, but 
do not stir. Now push the kettle back 
on the stove, where it will simply 
bubble on the side, not boil. Sim- 
mer two hours. Have ready peeled 
some small potatoes of uniform size, 
and put into the kettle, pushing the 
meat and onions gently to one sida 
to make room for them. The con- 
tents of the kettle must not be stirred 
more than absolutely necessary. As 
soon as the potatoes are done, which 
will be in about 20 minutes, serve. — 
Mrs. Maria Telford.

Western Mulligan. 

We cannot measure these by "por- 
tion," as is often done, as the "por- 
tion" that would satisfy an able- 
bodied hunter who had been tramp- 
ing - the woods for hours would differ 
most decidedly from the portion that 
a lady would sip at home for he" 
noon-day lunch — or for the first 
course for a meal — so our recipes are 
expressed in the terms of quarts or 
gallons. In "Mulligans" it was esti- 
mated as nearly as possible how 
many gallons of the decoction the 
culinary efforts produced, about how 
many pints or cups of cut vegetables 
were used and about how many 
pounds of meat. We figured all prices 
always at what the items are worth 
to buy them in the Portland markets, 
understanding and appreciating the 
fact that you don't pay for the vege- 
tables raised in your own "war gar- 
dens," or for the game you have 
killed yourself in the woods, but all 
of these have the intrinsic value that 
belongs to them in the market, al- 
though they don't cost you money. 

A "Mulligan" Out West. 

Is a sort of stew which is made of 
meat and vegetables in sufficient 
quantity so that it is intended to bo 
the principal food of the meal. 

Makes 3 quarts; serves 8 people. 

Cost. 

1 soup bone, very little fat $0.1000 

1 lb. potatoes 0300 

y 2 lb. onions 0200

2 t salt 0006

Wood, 2 hours (half use) 0286 

Cost of 3 quarts $0.2663 

Cost per quart, 9 cents; cost per 
cupful, 2% cents. 

Cut meat from bone in small pieces. 
Put your little bit of fat from bone 
into vessel in which you are going to 
cook your stew (preferably an iron 
kettle). When fat is softened by heat 
add oil and sliced onion and pieces 
of meat. Fry, stirring constantly, 
until meat is well seared and onions 
are golden color. Add sliced carrots, 
parsnips and turnips or rutabagas. 
Stir well and pour over them two 
quarts of boiling water. Set back on 
stove and let simmer for 1% hours 
Then add the sliced potatoes, and 
simmer until tender. See that there 
is plenty of water to prevent burn- 
ing, but they must not be flooded 
with water. Add salt, pepper, pa- 
prika, celery or whatever flavor you 
like. Serve with it croutons made of 
stale bread. 



1 made and served this stew to a 
family of adults and they pronounced 
it very good. Beside the stew we had 
sliced tomatoes, bread and butter, 
blackberries and tea cakes. Part of 
the people were company, but I am 
sure we all had enough. — Mrs. Kittie 
Goodall Turner, Corvallis, Or.

fcund convenient to tie the bones in a

Bring the stew to a boil, quickly

and add the chopped parsley. 

This is a recipe from the "War 
Time Cookery" that has been running 
in the papers. I thought it ought to 
be economical, being war-time cook- 
ery, and I would figure it out. But 
7% cents per cupful for a broth is 
very expensive. Please notice that 
our broths, or light course soups cost 
from a fraction of a cent to 2 or 3 
cents a cupful usually, while our 
heavy stews, intended for the real 
family meal, cost less than this broth. 
The only way we can really know 
v/hat is economical and what isn't in 
any foods is to figure out our recipes 
exactly, as we are doing, so that we 
know what they cost per portion to a 
fraction of a cent. People sometimes 
say: "Oh, a few cents or a fraction 
of a cent doesn't matter. I'd be 
ashamed to be so small." Yet the 
same people are very serious about 
the exact price per loaf of baker's 
bread, and about the 6-cent streetcar 
fare. Let us think In the same way 
of our food items. It isn't this loaf, 
or this soup we make today, any 
more than it would be a special loaf 
at the bakery at 15c or a streetcar 
ride for 6 or even 10 cents. It is 
what these things all amount to in 
the aggregate — the total food bill of 
the nation; the surplus we can save 
to send our allies. When we think in 
these terms the saving of a fraction 
of a cent on soups or stews or any 
other food perhaps means the lives of 
those who are fighting our battles, or 
even victory for our own land ulti- 
mately. We women have hardly 
wakened to the seriousness of this 
matter yet. It has not really come 
home to us that these little differ- 
ences in price are the very biggest 
thing in our lives and the one thing 
our government is calling on us for.

Fish and Sea Food 



Fish Prices. 

It is said that we people of Oregon, 
who live where fish and sea food are 
so abundant, really eat less of them 
than the average of the people of the 
whole United .States, most of whom 
are far from the seacoast. I have 
lead that we only eat eight pounds 
apiece per year, on an average, which 
would be about one meal per month. 
Of course, while we people of Port- 
land have all this sea food practically 
at our door, the whole of Eastern 
Oregon is away from our market, and 
prices are high. Southern Oregon has 
fish, but not the sea food locally, and 
transportation rates are very high. 
But right here, where these food 
products are most abundant, they 
cost more than meat. It seems strange 
to an ordinary housewife that animals 
can be raised, cared for and fed for 
years to furnish meat that can be sold 
cheaper than fish that abound free in 
our adjacent waters, require no 
care (from those who sell them, any- 
way), and never have to be fed. Why 
is this? They say it is a trust. I 
have no idea myself, but our govern- 
ment has urged us to substitute fish 
for part of our meat diet, and it is 
our patriotic duty to do so. It has 
occurred to me that it would be a 
great and most worthy service at this 
time for some one of our many wom- 
en's clubs to take up the study of this 
question and find out just why fish 
costs more than meat, and if it isn't 
possible to reduce the price. We Ore- 
gon women can vote, and we have as 
much right and interest in these 
questions as men, especially in a food 
question. It is peculiarily our prov- 
ince. If we could accomplish even a 
little in a practical way at this time 
in this vital food conservation mat- 
ter it would be a great credit to the 
women of Oregon over all the United 
States. 

(Note. — Since the above was printed 
the Chamber of Commerce has taken 
up the question of cheaper fish, 
opened a municipal fish market and 
have very materially reduced the 
price of fish.)

The Food Value of Fish. 

The subject that interests us as 
much or more than the prices of our 
fish and sea food is the much mooted 
question of their food value and di- 
gestibility. Everyone knows the cur- 
rent saying, "Fish for brain workers," 
but authorities do not agree on this. 
I have been looking this up, together 
with the food value, digestibility, etc., 
of fish, and here is the net result of 
what I know and can find out: 

Fish belongs to the nitrogenous 
group of foods, so it builds and re- 
pairs muscular flesh and tissue. It is 
digested mainly in the stomach. The 
albuminoid matter in white fish such 
as cod, haddock and halibut, is about 
the same as in beef and mutton. The 
proportion of water in fish, flesh and 
fowl is also quite uniform; fish con- 
tains, however, more phosphorus, the 
active fish, as trout and pickerel, con- 
taining the greater percentage. The 
amount of carbon depends largely 
upon the amount of fat the fish con- 
tain. White fleshed fish are, there- 
fore, deficient in carbon, as their fat 
is secreted and held in their liver. A 
scientific cook would tell you to serve 
with boiled white fish, potatoes and 
cucumbers or lettuce with French 
dressing, as that would supply the 
lacking carbohydrates and fat. 

Pink fleshed fish, as salmon and 
sturgeon, have their fat all through 
their body, and so are harder to di- 
gest, although they have, alone, a 
greater food value. 

So we see that the white fleshed 
fish are better for the delicate stom- 
ach, and the colored fish make a much 
better diet for the active man; and 
the more active the fish the greater 
the amount of muscle-making food it 
will contain. "Fish, on account of its 
density of fiber, would not be recom- 
mended as a frequent diet for brain 
workers." — Mrs. S. T. Rorer. 

Then here is another authority: 
"Fish meat, with but few exceptions, 
is less stimulating and nourishing 
than meat of other animals, but is 
usually easier of digestion. Salmon, 
mackerel and eels are exceptions. 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



White fish are especially easy of di- 
gestion. Fish is not recommended for 
brain workers on account of the large 
amount of phosphorus (an element 
abounding largely in nerve tissue) 
which it contains, but because of its 
easy digestibility." — Mrs. F. M. Far- 
mer. 

Mrs. Rorer says fish are too dense 
to digest easily. Mrs. Farmer recom- 
mends them because they do. "Where 
doctors disagree we will just have 
to find out for ourselves by eating 
them whether they agree with us, re- 
membering that fried fish, or dry 
baked fish, may disagree with us 
when creamed fish, chowders, etc., 
will not. 

To Select Fish. 

The flesh should be firm, the scales 
should be bright and stick closely to 
the fish, the eyes and gills should be 
bright, and the flesh free from any 
unpleasant odor. Salmon, cod and 
large white fish should have a bronze 
tint when freshly cut. Fish are poi- 
sonous if stale, and should be eaten 
when in season and as soon after they 
are killed as possible. 

The Preparation of Fish. 

Here are some suggestions about 
the more common fish and their prep- 
aration: 

Cod is a fine boiling fish, and may 
be fried in slices, but is never used 
in baking. 

Haddock, very much like cod, but 
smaller, is also usually cheap, and is 
in season throughout the year, but 
the very large head is waste, so 
makes it more expensive than it 
seems. Cooked the same as cod. 

Halibut is the largest fish we get, 
unless it is sturgeon. It is cut in 
slices and sold by the pound, and, be- 
ing solid meat, is very economical. It 
is in season throughout the year. 

Flounders are admirable boiling 
fish, or they may be made into fillets 
and fried, or served au gratin. 

Shad come into the rivers from the 
sea in the early spring. They are in 
season from February 1 to the middle 
of June. 

Trout are generally fresh water 
fish, and those from small streams 
are perhaps our very finest fish. 

Smelt are small and always sold by 
the pound. They are usually rolled in 
egg and bread crumbs, or in corn 
meal, and fried. (Remember yester- 
day's suggestion of putting a plate 
over to turn, as they are so delicate 
it is hard to keep them whole.) 

Boneless salted herring makes an 
exceedingly nice relish for the be- 
ginning of a lunch. 

Eels and catfish, fish without 
scales, are skinned, dipped in egg and 
bread crumbs, and fried. 



Mackerel is in season from May 1 to 
September 1, and is one of the best 
known fish. They are best boiled. 

Salmon, the most prized of all, for 
its pink flesh and fine flavor, live in 
both salt and fresh waters, and are 
in season from May to September, but 
frozen salmon may be obtained nearly 
all the year. 

Mrs. Fannie Merritt Farmer says: 
"In the Columbia river and its tribu- 
taries salmon are so abundant that 
extensive canneries are built along 
the banks." Yet we people who live 
right here in the famous home of the 
salmon do not begin to use as much 
of it as we should. It may be sliced 
and broiled, or planked; boiled whole 
or in slices, and served with sauce 
Hollandaise (see below) it is the most 
elegant of dinner fish. 

To Clean Smelt. 

Make a slight opening at the gills 
with either a sharp knife or a pair of 
scissors; then draw the smelt between 
the thumb and finger, from the tail 
to the head. In this way all the in- 
testines will be pressed out at the gill 
opening. Wash and dry, sprinkle with 
salt, and they are ready to dip and 
fry. 

To Fry Fish. 

Fish may be fried in any fat, but 
are considered better fried in oil. 
Handle with care, so as not to bruise. 
Wash and prepare for cooking. 

Put sufficient fat in a deep pan to 
completely cover the fish. Beat a 
whole egg, add a tablespoonful of hot 
water, dip the fish first in the egg, 
then roll in bread or cracked crumbs. 
Put a few fish at a time in a frying 
basket and sink in the hot fat; as 
soon as browned lift carefully and 
drain. Garnish with lemon and pars- 
ley. 

(This is a very expensive way to do 
for ordinary occasions, as the fat re- 
maining that the fish were fried In 
can not be used for anything else. If 
on© wishes to use this method for 
some special occasion the fat can be 
drained off and used for frying other 
fish in the usual way, and, of course, 
all fat remaining after frying fish 
should be drained off in a cup by 
itself and kept till the next ones are 
fried. — "Save the fats"). 

Fillets of Fish. 

For this it is better to use a white 
fish, rock or white bass, etc. After 
the fish has been scaled and cleaned 
put your hand firmly on the fish and 
with a sharp knife cut from the tail 
to the head just as near the bone as 
possible, removing all the flesh. Turn 
the fish on the other side and do the 
same thing. In this way you will re- 
move all the bones 



FISH AND SEA FOOD. 



Cut the fish into strips all the way 
across, and about an inch wide. Roll 
and fasten with a wooden skewer. 
Have ready a deep pan of hot fat. Put 
a half dozen of these rolls in your 
frying basket and plunge them into 
the hot fat; they will quickly curl 
tighter, and will cook in about three 
minutes. Drain on brown paper, dust 
with salt, arrange on a napkin, gar- 
nish with parsley and lemon. — Mrs. 
Rorer.

About iy 2 cupfuls cost $0.1906 

Put butter in a bowl, cover with 
cold water, and wash, using a spoon. 
Divide in three pieces. Put one piece 
in top of double boiler with yolks of 
eggs and lemon juice, place in boiling 
water in bottom and stir constantly 
until butter is melted, then add sec- 
ond piece of butter, and, as it thick- 
ens, third piece; add water, cook one 
minute and season with salt and cay- 
enne. If left over the fire a moment 
too long it will curdle; if it does add 
two tablespoonfuls heavy cream. 

(Of course, such a sauce as this is 
far too expensive for us plain, eco- 
nomical people for ordinary use, but 
it is well to have recipes for an oc- 
casional "company dish," as my 
mother used to call them.) 

Many of us are not familiar with 
cooking the "crustacea" — lobsters, 
crabs, shrimps and crawfish, so I will 
condense some practical directions as 
to how to prepare and cook these pe- 
culiar sea foods. 

Lobsters. 

These are nitrogenous food, helping 
to build and repair the muscles and 
tissues, but are also very dense and 
difficult of digestion, and to be safe 
to eat must be alive when cooked. 
If allowed to die they are dangerous, 
and must be used, also, soon after 
cooking. 

To kill a lobster have ready a large 
kettle of warm water. It is not nec- 
essary that the water be boiling; In 
fact, the lobster will die more quickly 
in warm than in boiling water. Hold 
the lobster upside down, grasping him 
by the back; put his head, then his 
body under the water and quickly 
cover the kettle. He will die in- 
stantly. 

To broil a lobster take it from the 
water immediately, cut it into halves, 
remove the stomach and Intestine, 
and it is ready to broil. 



For salad, lobster Newberg, or any 
dish that calls for the simple reheat- 
ing of the meat, cook slowly for 
three-quarters of an hour, adding salt 
after cooking a half hour. Rapid 
boiling toughens the meat. Do not 
remove the meat from the shell until 
you are ready to use it. 

To open a lobster, after it is thor- 
oughly chilled, twist off the claws 
and then the tail shell from the body. 
Split the tail underneath directly 
down the center, and remove the meat 
in one long piece. Pull open the body 
shell, take out the "liver" of the lob- 
ster, which you will know by its 
greenish soft condition; also the shell; 
remove the stomach, sometimes called 
the "lady," which is found immedi- 
ately underneath the head. Throw 
this away. Pick the meat from the 
shell; break into halves the solid 
piece of meat that you have taken 
from the tail, and remove the intes- 
tine running its entire length. Crack 
the claws and pick out the meat. 
To Serve Lobster Plain. 

Arrange the meat in the center of 
a cold platter, garnish with the small 
claws, crisp, light leaves of lettuce, 
hard boiled eggs cut into quarters, 
and pickled beets cut into fancy 
shapes. Use with this French dress- 
ing. 

Crabs. 

Crabs, like lobsters, must be pur- 
chased alive, put into warm water and 
boiled in exactly the same way. Lift 
the crabs with tongs, as they cannot 
be safely handled like lobsters. Put 
in one at a time, cover the kettle and 
wait for it to die; then put in an- 
other; when the last is in and the 
water has almost reached the boiling 
point, add a tablespoonful of salt and 
cook slowly for 30 minutes. Take 
from the fire; when cool twist off the 
legs; pull off the "aprons," or loose 
flaps in under the shell; remove the 
stomach (under the head, like the 
lobsters) and the little twist of intes- 
tines and the gills. Cut the crab di- 
rectly in halves, so that the meat may 
be picked out carefully without get- 
ting any bone in It. 

To Serve Cold. 

Wash and dry the upper shells; fill 
them with cold crab meat, dish and 
garnish with cress. Serve with 
French dressing. 

Crawfish and Shrimps. 

These are usually sold boiled, and 
can be made into any of the recipes 
given for lobsters and crabs. Shrimps 
in cream sauce or shrimp salad are 
among the best ways of serving 
shrimps, or they may be served cold 
with French dressing. Crawfish are 
often used to garnish fancy dishes of 
lobster.

SERVING FISH. 

Many men who carve poultry per- 
fectly do not know just how to carve 
fish, and "mess it all up" after all 
our efforts to serve it attractively, so 
I'm giving directions today. 

To Serve Pish Properly. 

Boiled and baked fish are carved in 
the same manner. Use always a sil- 
ver knife and fork, as steel spoils the 
flavor of the fish. Garnish with pars- 
ley and quarters of lemon. To carve, 
first cut off the head just behind the 
gills, then run the knife through the 
fish lengthwise as near to the back- 
bone as possible. Cut the upper half 
into slices or pieces cut crosswise of 
the fish, as wide as you desire to 
serve. After serving all the upper 
portion, loosen the backbone and turn 
it to the back of the plate. Cut and 
serve the underside the same way you 
did the upper. Planked or boiled fish 
are cut crosswise double through the 
backbone, but be very careful to 
strike the joints between the verte- 
brae, breaking them quickly open, or 
the flesh of the fish will be mashed, 
and both flavor and appearance 
spoiled. (Have your knife very 
sharp). 

Standard Rales for Serving Fish. 

With planked fish serve potato puff 
and cucumbers with French dressing. 

With broiled fish, creamed potatoes 
and cucumbers with French dressing. 

With baked fish, fried potato balls 
and cucumbers as before. 

With boiled fish, sauce Hollandaise 
(see yesterday's recipe), boiled pota- 
to balls with parsley sauce, and cu- 
cumbers as before. 

With small fish fried, sauce tartare 
and light crisp bread. 

With fish croquettes and cutlets for 
luncheon or supper, warm crisp rolls 
and potato roses. 

With fried halibut steaks for lunch, 
cucumbers as before, graham bread 
and coffee. 

With creamed or deviled fish, cu- 
cumber sauce and crisp bread. 

With salt cod, boiled potatoes, pars- 
nips and sour milk biscuit or brown 
bread. 

With creamed cod for lunch or sup- 
per, serve plain boiled potatoes. 

With salt mackerel, fried mush or 
corn bread. 

With fish timbales with cream, lob- 
ster, shrimp or oyster, crab sauce and 
a garnish of tiny potato balls. 

Sweets should not be served with 
or after a fish dinner, supper or 
luncheon. 

However, plain people will continue 
to use fish cooked in any plain and 
economical way to which they are ac- 
customed, or which they learn in our 
kitchen. And with fish as the meat 



of the meal we will serve potatoes 
and other vegetables as usual. How- 
ever, we can get an idea of the food 
that balances fish in a complete ra- 
tion from this table, and all of us can 
serve brown bread, cucumbers with 
French dressing and use chopped 
parsley as a garnish. 

Ways of Cooking Fish. 

Here are the best ways of cooking 
fish condensed and adapted to our 
needs, from well known authorities: 

To Cook Fish in Boiling Water — 
Small cod, haddock, etc., are cooked 
whole in enough boiling water to 
cover them, to which is added salt for 
flavor and lemon juice or vinegar to 
keep the fish white. It is better to 
boil the fish on a rack of some kind 
in a large kettle or pan, or coiled up 
in a wire basket in a deep kettle, but 
it can be wrapped in a cloth and 
boiled that way if you have neither 
of these. Large fish are cut in thick 
pieces and tied in pieces of cheese- 
cloth to boil. Remove the skin, or 
scald it and scrape to remove the col- 
oring. The fish is cooked when the 
flesh leaves the bone and not before. 

To Broil Fish — Cod, haddock, mack- 
erel, etc., are split down the back and 
broiled whole. Salmon, chicken hali- 
but and other large fish are cut in 
inch slices for broiling. Smelt and 
other small fish are broiled whole, 
without splitting. Clean and wipe 
fish as dry as possible, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and place in well 
greased wire double broiler. Slices of 
fish should be turned often while 
broiling; whole split fish should be 
first well broiled on the flesh side, 
then turned and broiled on the skin 
side just long enough to make skin 
crisp and brown. Loosen one side of 
the broiler, then the other, or fish 
will cling to it and tear. 

To Bake Fish — Clean and place on 
strips of cotton cloth under the fish 
in the well greased dripping pan. Lift 
out by these strips of cloth and re- 
move them. 

To Fry Fish — Clean fish and wipe 
as dry as possible. Sprinkle with 
salt, dip in flour or crumbs, egg and 
crumbs, etc., and fry as described yes- 
terday. 

To Saute Fish — Prepare as for fry- 
ing and cook in frying pan with small 
amount of fat, or, if preferred, dip in 
granulated corn meal. Cod steak and 
smelts are often cooked in this way.

or green nasturtium seed pods that 
keep for years and are very good.) 

Our Fish Food Value Table. 

In the table following the protein is 
muscle-building food, and the fats 
and carbohydrates (sugar, starch, 
etc.), are mutually replaceable, though 
a given weight of fat produces a little 
more than twice as much energy as 
the same weight of carbohydrates. 
Our food repairs the body and gives it 
energy — the power to work and ac- 



complish. This energy produced by 
food i,s measured in various ways. 
One of the most common is to express 
it in terms of the heat it would take 
to produce that much energy — and 
this is known as calories. So that the 
greater the number of calories the 
greater the amount of energy pro- 
duced, and hence the better the fish 
(or anything else) as a food. 

This is a complex scientific matter 
if gone into deeply, but we can any 
of us understand this much, and so 
find the table very useful.

Salmon is considered the most nu- 
tritious of all fish. 

Clean well. Cut off the head. Fill 
the fish with a nicely prepared stuf- 
fing made of rolled cracker or stale 
bread crumbs, seasoned with butter, 
pepper, salt and sage. Wrap in a well 
floured cloth, tied closely with twine 
and steam for 25 minutes. The gar- 
nishes are parsley and slices of boiled 
egg- or sliced lemon and beets. While 
steaming or boiling fish, if a little 
vinegar and salt are added to the wa- 
ter they will prevent the nutriment 
from escaping. — Mrs. Egger.

dish (after draining or drying), add a 
little mustard seed, a few cloves, a 
few small red peppers, two or three

and fry it with the onion until both 
are a delicate brown, add the potatoes,

Turkey — the King of Fowls 



Preparing Fowls. 

In preparing' chickens, ducks, tur- 
keys, or wild fowls, I always treat 
them to a bath with Ivory soap and 
warm water, using- a brush or clean 
white cloth to scrub them with. Rinse 
well and draw. 

If fowls are bought on the market 
be sure to wash well. I have seen 
people scald them in very filthy tubs 
and pails. 

Where fowls are to be cut up be- 
fore cooking always unjoint them, 
then there will be no danger of kill- 
ing your family or friends on small 
pieces of bone. Cut the breast bone 
lengthwise and crosswise with a very 
sharp knife. — Mrs. W. W. Williams.

After washing and drawing turkey,

given, or any of the desired stuffings; 
then sew it up, truss and rub with 
butter, sprinkle on pepper, salt and 
flour. Put in hot oven to roast, re- 
duce the heat and put two cups of

dry meat juicy and delicious. Turn 
the breast up about 1 hour before re- 
moving from the oven to brown. Al- 
low about 25 minutes for each pound 
and cook slowly until half an hour 
before done. Then have a very hot 
oven to brown and crisp the skin. 
Baste every ten minutes. — Mrs. H. H. 
Minard.

For Roasting Turkey. 

Prepare your turkey the night be- 
fore. Clean and wash it, then let it 
stand in cold water one hour; then 
drain off the water and put in a cool 
place over night. In the morning salt 
and pepper it, take 2 tablespoonfuls 
of butter and rub it all over, all parts 
of it. Sprinkle flour over it, then 
take one pound of the best suet and 
cut it in strips half an inch thick and 
lay it all over the top of the turkey. 
Now put it in the roaster. Roast 3 
hours, or till it makes it nice and 
tender. 

Dressing — For dressing, take one 
cup of butter, put it in the frying pan, 
let it fry until dark brown; then take 
bread, cut in pieces, let it fry until 
brown. Then add one large onion, 
chopped fine, sticks of celery, salt, 
pepper, sage and enough water to 
make it ready for use, as stuffing. 
You will find this delicious. — Mrs. R. 
E. Crome, Mt. Angel, Or.

Cost for each, 13% cents. 

Take an old hen and boil until ten- 
der; lay in roasting pan with a little 
of the broth and brown a nice golden 
brown all over; remove the chicken 
and add more broth to make about 
1% quarts of gravy; thicken and drop 
in dumplings made as follows: Beat 
one or two eggs very light, add one- 
third cup of water for each egg used; 
sift in 1% teaspoonfuls baking pow- 
der (heaping), one-half teaspoonful 
salt and flour enough for a very stiff 
batter. Drop by teaspoonfuls in the 



boiling gravy, boil about six or seveu 
minutes and serve around the chicken. 
These are always light if properly 
made. 

As we live on a farm and raise 
everything we use, I am unable to 
figure out the costs. Our hens and 
roosters average six to eight pounds 
each, and that is more than a city 
family wants to buy as a rule. 

Both of these recipes I have used 
for several years and find them to be 
very good. — Mrs. O. W. Lindahl, R. 
No. 2, Linnton, Or. 

(Mrs. Rorer uses this recipe for 
dumplings by leaving out the eggs 
entirely, using 1 R t baking powder 
and 2-3 c milk or water. Cooking 10 
minutes when dropped by teaspoon- 
fuls. I drop from tablespoon and boil 
20 minutes or longer. Be careful to 
keep kettle covered tightly and boil- 
ing gently all the while.)

This will make 8 large dumplings, 
and, allowing Vs lb. chicken to each 
portion, will serve 8 people at 16 ^c 
each. 

Cut the chicken in pieces, cover 
with water and put on to stew. When 
partly tender add the salt. Lift the 
chicken to a hot platter and when the 
broth is boiling drop in the dumplings 
by spoonfuls, made as follows: Beat 
the egg, add salt, milk, the flour, in 
which the baking powder has been 
sifted. It should be stiff enough to be 
cut off in spoonfuls about the size of 
an egg. Place a tight cover on the 
kettle and do not lift the cover for 10 
minutes. Lift out and arrange on the 
platter with the chicken. Pepper 
lightly and pour over the platter the 
stock left in the stew pan. Garnish 
with parsley. 

If the cover is lifted on the dump- 
lings they will be very heavy and 
solid, otherwise light and very deli- 
cious. Being quite filling, dumplings 
really lessen the cost of the dish, as 
a smaller portion of chicken is needed, 
and, therefore, one chicken serves 
more people. — Mrs. W. E. Metzger.

a little more water (and if chicken is 



not fat add 1 T Crisco or butter), now 
add garlic, chili powder, salt and

then add the tomatoes. It is better to 
first rub tomatoes through collander. 
It must cook until chicken is tender 
and the tomatoes the consistency of

The time for cooking I could not 
give accurately, because of the dif-

and let boil for three minutes, add 
onions, beans, corn, potatoes, chicken 
and spices. Cover tightly and cook 
very slowly for two and a half hours, 
stirring frequently from the bottom. 
Add tomatoes, sugar and celery, and 
cook for another half hour or even 
three-quarters. Fifteen minutes be- 
fore serving add the milk and the 
noodles. Southern chicken, when 
ready to serve, should be thick, and 
is more easily served in large soup 
dishes or plates. 

This is very delicious, as our boys 
in the South can probably tell you so. 
Sufficient for at least 14 good-sized 
soup plates average about 10 cents 
per plate, and you have had a good 
big meal when you are through. In

tute rabbit or squirrel. — Mrs. P. J.

Or a trifle more than 12%c a por-

Cut chicken in pieces and roll in 
flour. Place in roasting pan or heavy 
iron skillet. Place in hot oven with 
small bits of drippings here and there. 
I prefer sausage or bacon drippings. 
Brown well. Add water to fill pan 
two-thirds to cover and cook in me- 
dium hot oven. A.di .-nion, minced 
fine, and thyme abouc three-quarters 
of an hour before taking up, and 20 
minutes before serving and flour, 
pepper, salt and milk mixed smooth. 
This makes a rich, creamy gravy. No 
matter how old the hen, it can be 
made tender and delicious by this 
method. I have allowed time for 
cooking the average market hen, but 
young chickens do not require so 
much time, very old ones may need a 
little longer, that you can determine 
by testing. The thyme may be omitted 
and if liked parsley or other herbs 
used. — Mrs. H. C. Fixott, 1122 East

Chicken and Macaroni. 

Enclosed find a recipe entered for 
first prize in the contest for this 
week: 

Cost. 

2 lbs. chicken (30c) $0.6000 

1 package macaroni 1000 

1 can tomatoes 1500 

1 small onion (IT) 0016

V 2 t pepper 0021 

Wood, 1 hour ( % use) 0143 

Cost for 8 persons $0.9004 

Or 11% cents each. 

Prepare and fry chicken in the lard 
or butter. While the chicken is fry- 
ing, boil macaroni in salted water un- 
til tender and drain. Remove chicken 
from pan and add water to make 
about a pint of gravy. .Strain and add 
the tomatoes. Return chicken to the 
pan and cook 10 minutes longer. Now 
pour over macaroni and serve. This 
will serve about eight persons and 
makes a meal in itself. We raise most 
of the things we eat and our wood 
doesn't cost anything, so am unable 
to figure in the cost of it. The other 
prices I took from the paper. — Fannie 
Lindell, Holbrook, Or. 

(Mrs. Lindell is mistaken in saying 
her wood doesn't cost her anything. I 
lived three years on an Oregon ranch, 
and know my husband put in many 
hard day's work with hired man and 
team part of the time in getting the 
wood, and "time is money," even more 
so on a farm than elsewhere, because 
scarcer there. Oregon wood burns up 
so quickly that it is especially expen- 
sive in labor. Most farmers think 
that, considering the time required to 
■cut and market wood, it doesn't pay 



as well as other things on a farm — 
and I know that that is little enough. 
The only items Mrs. Lindell has in 
her favor in having the wood is the 
cost of hauling to town and the cost 
of delivering, unless the wood was 
hauled out of the way to her, and the 
difference between the buying and 
selling price at the wood yards. This 
applies exactly the same to all the 
produce on the farm. Think this out, 
farmers' wives, and realize that every 
single thing you use on your farm has 
a very real value, though you don't 
pay actual cash for it.)

After washing and drawing the hen,

milk and 3 tablespoonfuls fat; mix 
lightly, roll and prick and put on top 
of the chicken and brown well. Serve 
with it blackberry jelly. — Mrs. Kittie 
Goodall Turner. 

(Mrs. Turner writes me that Port- 
land prices are much higher than they 
are with her near Corvallis. She says 
she can get fat hens for 22 cents per 
pound and chickens for 25 cents per 
pound. It seems rather unfair to fig- 
ure her recipe (as she did) at our 
prices, but, as I have often said, the 
value of our work is in the compara- 
tive cost of one recipe with another, 
based on the same standard of prices. 
Mrs. Turner's way of frying- out her 
fat from her hen for shortening for 
her crust sounds familiar to me. That 
is what I was brought up to do al- 
ways, and I assure you it makes a 
most delicious crust. Can you believe 
that I have seen young city women 
throw that fat away?)

BELGIAN HARE. 

There are many Belgian hare in our 
markets, and they are one of the best 
and most economical substitutes for 
beef, pork and mutton — the meats 
which we are asked to conserve for 
government use. But many of us are 
repelled by the looks of them skinned 
and bloody, and so do not buy them. 
The pelt of the Belgian hare is quite 
valuable, being sold, when prepared, 
under the name of electric or near 
seal, so it is always removed before 
the animal is sold, and Belgian hare 
is looked upon as a great delicacy 
where it is used. It is canned and 
sold under the name of "boned tur- 
key." The meat is white and com- 
pact, of fine flavor and tender. They 
are the cleanest of all animals, being 
reared for the fur, and are well fed 
and cared for. "It is said by physi- 
cians that broth made from Belgian 
hare is preferable to that made from 
beef, mutton or chicken; that it is not 
so stimulating and slightly nutri- 
tious." They may be cooked in every 
way in which one can cook chicken — 
croquettes, panned, ragout, pot pies, 
fried, roasted, stuffed and baked, etc. 
The tougher pieces may be used for 
Stock. The recipe below tells how to 
prepare it for any kind of cooking.

Split the hare down through the 
center; wipe it carefully with a damp 
cloth, but do not wash it; if there is 
the slightest appearance of fur on the 
meat, singe it. Now disjoint the hind 
legs and make two pieces of them; 
cut off the saddle; take off the fore- 
quarter, making in all nine pieces. 
Arrange these neatly in a baking pan, 
flesh side down. Dust lightly with 
pepper, add 1 tablespoonful chopped 
onion and a bay leaf. Put a tea- 
spoonful of kitchen bouquet into % 
pint of stock or water, add 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, stir and pour into 



the pan. Cover with another pan, put 
into a quick oven and bake lVz hours, 
basting frequently. A half hour be- 
fore the hare is done remove the up- 
per pan so that each piece may be 
nicely browned. Dish neatly and gar- 
nish with triangular pieces of toast. 
To the pan add 2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour and 2 of butter; mix and add 1 
pint of stock or water (the pan should 
be dry when the hare is done). Stir 
this sauce until boiling, add a half 
teaspoonful of salt. Pour this sauce 
over the hare, dust with chopped 
parsley and serve. — Mrs. Rorer. 

Here is one thing we can each and 
every one of us resolve right now to 
do for the food conservation cause, 
and that is to use Belgian hare, or 
Eastern Oregon rabbit, as often as 
possible. These recipes we are hav- 
ing assure us that they are whole- 
some and palatable, and the recipes 
sound delicious. As soon as Eastern 
Oregon rabbits come in market let us 
get some and try our collection of 
recipes. It seems to me this is the 
cheapest and best food conservation 
we have found yet, peculiarly adapted 
to use here in Oregon. 

WILD GAME — RABBITS. 

Our request was to let us have 
many recipes for cooking game, large 
and small. It is often in our market 
and we would buy more if we knew 
better how to cook it. Write us par- 
ticularly about these Eastern Oregon 
rabbits that are sent here in such 
numbers. Are they really good, 
wholesome food, and just how will we 
know which ones are good, and what 
is the best way to cook them? They 
are so very plentiful in Oregon and 
so cheap that all other things being 
equal they ought to be our very best 
"meat substitute." Of course, they 
are meat, but they would not be ex- 
ported largely, and by taking the 
place of beef, mutton, pork, etc., they 
would release just that much more 
of these meats for shipment to our 
soldiers, and we had a very large re- 
sponse, all commending Belgian hare

The rabbit recipes are equally good 
for cooking Belgian hare, so not many

Cooking Rabbits. 

(The conservation of a nuisance.) 
Mrs. O. J. Culbertson, Mulino, Or., 
says: "I lived for several years on 
the plains in Colorado, where rabbits, 
ducks and antelopes abounded. In se- 
lecting rabbits be careful of taking 
old ones, as they sometimes have dis- 
eased lumps on their necks and back, 
and sometimes the flesh has watery

blisters on it. These should be avoid- 
ed. However, the young ones are 
usually healthy, and make fine eat- 
ing. In cooking the Eastern Oregon 
rabbits, always select young ones, if 
possible. I hope I may contribute 
something which may prove helpful." 
It is hard to price Mrs. Culbertson's 
recipes, so we will print most of them 
without doing so, as they are quite 
unusual and interesting, especially to 
those who have wild game. 

Cooking: Wild Game. 

Tou will find this recipe one of the 
best ones in cooking wild game such 
as prairie chickens, rabbits, etc., for 
I always use it myself with good re- 
sults. I always fix my game the 
night before I use it. I clean and 
wash it, then let it stand in cold wa- 
ter for 30 minutes; then drain off the 
water, cut it up, put it in an earthen 
crock (that is not metal); salt and 
pepper each piece and sprinkle with 
vinegar and lay it in the jar until 
you get it all in. Then cover the jar 
up and let it stand in a cool place 
over night. In the morning I take it 
out, roll it in flour and fry it in but- 
ter. Cover it up while frying it. It 
will fry in 30 minutes. The vinegar 
makes it nice and tender. Tou can 
cook old game two and three years 
old this way and it will be as tender 
as young game. The vinegar also 
gives it a lovely taste. Tou can fix 
game this way and it will roast in 
one hour and be nice and tender. I 
can't just say how much vinegar to 
use; I usually take a cup half full and 
sprinkle out of it with my hand until 
I have enough. The vinegar must be 
good that you use. — Mrs. R. E. Crowe, 
Mt. Angel, Or.

teaspoonful flour and beat with spoon 
to prevent lumps, add 1 large cup of 
soup stock, a sprig of parsley, a bay 
leaf, a sprig of thyme (or % tea- 
spoonful) and J /4 teaspoonful cayenne

Baked Rabbit. 

Select a young rabbit, joint and lay 
in salt water a few hours. Boil in 
plenty of water to cover, with a strip 
of fat pork, until tender. Make a 
dressing same as for chicken, using 
broth from the rabbit. Put into bak- 
ing pan with pieces of rabbit on top, 
pressed well down in dressing. Pour 
cupful of broth over all. Add a few 
small lumps of butter and the salt 
pork. Bake in a moderate oven until 
well browned. — Mrs. Culbertson. 

To Judge Rabbits. 

An old rabbit has long, rough claws, 
and fur inclining to gray. When fresh 
the body will be rather stiff and the 
flesh dry and pale. If stale it will be 
limp and dark in color. — Mrs. Spencer.

Fried Rabbits. 

Mrs. E. V. Mills, of Salem, writes: 
I lived in Eastern Oregon and parts 
of Idaho, where rabbits were plenti- 
ful, and found the following ways 
fine in using them. The small ones 
are the youngest and best, but any of 
them are nice: 

Young Fried Rabbit.

Take small rabbit,- draw and skin, 
wash thoroughly and soak in salt wa- 
ter for an hour. Have your frying 
pan and grease hot, drain the water 
off the rabbit, wipe dry and break 
into pieces same as chicken. Where 
it is possible to joint it, do so, but

cut if not. Beat one egg with table- 
spoonful of hot water, and first dip 
pieces in flour, then in the egg, then 
into the flour again. Place in frying- 
pan and salt and pepper. Fry till nice 
golden brown, turn over and fry the 
same. When all is brown on both

Draw, skin and soak rabbit in salt 
water for one hour or over night, if 
liked. Wipe dry, joint and cut in 
pieces, frying size, and roll in flour 
or cornmeal. Have lard smoking hot; 
place pieces in pan and fry golden 
brown on both sides. Then pour in 
about a cupful or enough water to 
half cover the rabbit. Set in the oven 
and let cook for about an hour. The 
water in the pan makes a nice gravy. 
Or you can use egg if liked, the 
same as with young rabbit. Young 
jackrabbits are especially fine cooked 
either of these ways. — Mrs. E. V.

Food Value Tables. 

Today I have copied a U. S. govern-

week, and others. If we notice this 
table and study and use it I am sure 
we will find it helpful. Please notice 
that the food or fuel value is given 
last in calories per pound, so the real 
food value will depend on how much 
of each we u^e at a time. Butter has 
3405 calories and beefsteak 1090, but 
a man might eat a half pound of beef- 
steak at a meal, or 545 calories, and 
would not use, probably, over one 
ounce of butter or 213 calories. So 
we must remember that these figures 
are all for one pound of each, and es- 
timate accordingly.

Cheese as a Meat Substitute 



Dear Friends: The bulletin issued 
by the United States department of 
agriculture on cheese does away with 
the popular idea of the indigestibility 
of this useful and palatable food, 
which has been called to our atten- 
tion so prominently of late as an ideal 
substitute for meat, desirable both 
from the standpoint of health, as we 
pointed out recently, and in the great 
food conservation drive, in which we 
are all so vitally interested. The bul- 
letin explains from the result of scien- 
tific experiment the desirability of 
giving cheese an important place in 
one's diet. In Johnson's time cheese 
was used as we use meat now, for the 



principal dish of the meal, but it now 
has come to be used as a relish or 
side dish. And when nature rebels 
against a hearty meal of proteins 
with cheese added, we say complac- 
ently that it was the cheese that 
caused the trouble, and relegate it to 
the list of indigestibles. 

The government report has explod- 
ed this fallacy, putting this nutritious 
food in the proper place as the prin- 
cipal hearty dish of a meal, instead 
of an addition to a menu already 
heavy with proteins, so we need not, 
like Nebuchadnezzar, subsist on grass 
alone (or on vegetables), just because 
meat has been taken from us, for

from the fire and add % teaspoonful 
salt and a dash of pepper, and then 
stir in carefully the well-beaten 
whites. Turn into a baking dish and 
bake in a moderate oven for 15 or 20 
minutes. Serve immediately.

Prepare as in cheese fondue No. 1. 
In making these fondues, rice or any 
other cereal may be substituted for 
bread crumbs; 14 cupful of rice before 
cooking or 1 cupful cooked rice 
should be used. An advantage of 
omitting butter from cheese dishes, 
and of substituting water, or 
skimmed milk, for whole milk, is that 
it makes it possible to increase the 
amount of cheese without making the 
dish too rich. This is of great advan- 
tage because it tends to increase the 
tissue forming value of the dish, par- 
ticularly if skim milk is used 
rather than water. The ma>n reason, 
however, that I have copied both 
thcwe recipes is that you may notice 
with me the amazing difference in 
the cost of them. I never realized it 
at all till just now in figuring them 
out, and one has not by any means 
three times the food value of the 
other. I think our pricing of our old 
recipes must often surprise us all. 
That is just what I started this col- 
umn to do — to find out exactly what 
our food does cost, and its food value, 
in order that we may be able to prac- 
tice the economy and conservation of 
food that we are asked for at this 
time.

Here is a recipe for rice and cheese 
our family are very fond of: One 
cupful rice, 5 Quarts boiling water, 2 
tablespoonfuls salt. Wash rice in hot 
water five times, then in cold water 
three times. Have the water boiling 
vigorously; add salt, then the rice; 
sprinkle it in slowly, so that the wa- 
ter does not stop boiling. Boil vio- 
lently 15 minutes. Be careful not to 
over-cook. When no hard core can 
be felt on pinching the kernel be- 
tween thumb and finger it is done. 
Pour into a colander, saving the rice 
water for soup. Set the colander over 
a pot containing a little boiling water 
or in a cool oven, and let it steam un- 
til ready to serve. Each grain should 
be large and perfectly distinct. 

Cheese Sauce for Rice — 1% cupfuls 
milk, iy 2 tablespoonfuls flour, % tea- 
spoonful salt, 2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
y 2 cupful grated cheese, cayenne pep- 
per to taste. Stir the flour and salt 
smoothly into half cupful of milk; 
heat the remaining milk carefully to 
the boiling point, preferably in a 
small aluminum dish, and add the 
butter. Let all boil together for two 
minutes, and then set aside the pan 
to cool slightly, while grating the 
cheese. Add the cheese and bring 
slowly to boil, stirring constantly. 
Season with cayenne or whi*e pepper 
to suit taste and serve hot. — Mrs.

avenue. 

(I have not figured chopped green 
corn, or chopped green peppery, but I 
presume Mrs. Estes' figures are right 
in these, as her other pricing nearly 
all was. I will be glad to have any 
of you call attention to any mistake 
in pricing or figuring that appears in 
my columns, as we want our work 
absolutely correct and reliable, and 
mistakes may creep in in spite of the 
utmost care.)

Saving Meat 



(From the editorial page of the 
Evening Telegram.) 

I have often spoken of making a 
special effort to save meat for our 
soldiers and their allies, but I want 
to say a little more about it, as I feel 
that women as a whole do not under- 
stand just the way this matter stands 
for us in our homes, and I want to 
tell you how it seems to me. We 
all know how it is when unexpected 
company comes in just at meal time, 
and a quiet word is passed around 
to the family to "go light on the 
meat." It is just the same exactly 
now, only "the family" is the whole 
big United States. Some of us get 
confused on the issue before us be- 
cause it is put in such big terms — 
like these billions of dollars in loans 
and appropriations they write of so 
easily in the papers. The amount is 
so large it staggers and bewilders us, 
and it doesn't seem to apply to our 
little home in the suburbs at all. But 
it all does apply to us as to all, "we 
the people of the United States." 

Let's put it that these ally friends 
of ours, who are and have been for 
years, standing between us and the 
cruelty and rapacity of Germany are 
in sore straits — they need our help 
and our generous self-denial that we 
may be able to send food to them. Of 
all the states in the union, the old 
Oregon Country has always been 
justly famous for its free-handed 
hospitality. Suppose a brave band of 
friends with our own sons among 
them who had been fighting to de- 
fend our property from flames, or our 
lives from assassins, came to our 
ranch home, utterly worn out and ex- 
hausted by the conflict, and asked 
us for our meat to give them new 
strength to fight on and on for us 
and our interests, just as much as 
for their own, could we, of the big- 
hearted, hospitable West, say to 
them, "No, we are used to eating a 
certain quantity of meat ourselves 
each day, and we feel we do not care 
to give it up. We are sorry you need 
it, but you can't get it from our self- 
sacrifice." 

"Lives there a man with soul so 
dead?" — lives there a woman of the 
big, warm-hearted West, who would 
not most gladly give all she could to 
the needs of these, our sons, and 
brave friends, who are in sore straits 
for food, nearly exhausted with the 
years of conflict? Did you ever try 
to imagine yourself and your family 
as living in France instead of here. 
Row would we be feeling about these 
things now if we had happened to 
have been born there and suffered as 
these women have? There really is 
not enough for us all to have plenty; 



our government assures us of that. 
There are just so many animals in 
the country, "just enough to go 
round" for our own folks, so we must 
get along with less than we want if 
we leave a good share for those who 
are fighting our battles and enduring 
all kinds of deprivations and hard- 
ships for us. Let us just leave it the 
way we began. These friends have 
come in unexpectedly, and are very 
hungry and worn. Let's pass the 
word along to all the big family of 
humanity around us — "Family, go 
light on meat." — Aunt Prudence. 

WHAT TO BE DONE WITH A QUAR- 
TER OF BEEF. 

Dear Friends: Perhaps some of you 
may live in the suburbs and keep a 
pig which you intend to have killed 
this fall for your winter meat, or 
perhaps some friend may give you a 
piece of venison, or a big fish, etc., 
which is more than you can eat fresh; 
or perhaps you would like to be 
really thrifty and prepared for win- 
ter war prices, and would like to buy 
a quarter of beef and cut it up and 
"put it down" for winter use. If you 
have a large family it will surely pay 
you to do this. I know whereof I 
speak, for I have taken care of many 
a quarter of beef and the whole of 
many hogs on an Oregon ranch, as 
well as from my girlhood up, in the 
East. These recipes I give have 
come across the continent and been 
in our family for two generations. 
1 will copy them, as I have them 
written, after telling you just how I 
would proceed from the first. 
Preserve a Quarter of Beef. 

Select beef which has a clear 
cherry red color when exposed a few 
moments, meat marbled throughout 
with fat which is light straw color. 
When meat pressed by the finger 
rises up quickly it is prime, but if 
the dent disappears slowly or re- 
mains it is inferior. Inferior meat is 
from old or ill-fed animals and has 
a coarse, skinny, yellow fat and a 
dark red lean. Ox beef is the sweet- 
est and most juicy and most econom- 
ical. 

You can buy either a fore or hind 
auarter of beef — or a smaller piece — 
but it will cost you much more in 
proportion. The fore quarter is 
cheaper, as it contains less choice 
meat, but it is probably as good for 
the way we will preserve it. For 
cutting up we need a very sharp, 
pointed butcher knife and a meat 
saw. First, lay the fore quarter on 
a clean table with the inner side up. 
You will not have the head, so begin 
by sawing and cutting the meat 
straight across the ribs, about one- 



148 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



third of the way down from the 
backbone. This will come out just 
about the shoulders, leaving an upper 
one-third and a lower two-thirds. 

Next, cut your lower larger two- 
thirds across near the middle, just 
back of the shoulder. 

Next cut the inside piece you have 
just cut off (the piece you have cut 
off the shoulder) in two parts 
lengthwise, calling the upper piece 
(1) the "rib piece," for boiling or 
corning; the lower piece (2) is the 
"plate" piece for corning only. 

Now cut off crosswise, close to the 
leg, the "plate" piece attached to that 

(3) and this is the best piece for 
corning. 

Next saw the leg in two crosswise 
about the middle; the lower piece 

(4) is the "shank," good for soups 
and stews. You can boil this slowly 
for a long time till it is perfectly 
tender, and can the stock for soup 
stock in winter, and the meat for 
hash, meat balls, beef loaf, etc. The 
upper shoulder (5) is better meat, and 
I would cook slowly a long time and 
can it. (See Cold Pack Canning and 
recipes below.) 

Now we have disposed of the lower 
two-thirds of our quarter. The upper 
one-third we have left is the choicest 
part and contains our roast or beef- 
steak. Cut your piece in two cross- 
wise (a little more towards the mid- 
dle of the beef than the exact center). 
Your piece which would be nearest 
the middle of the whole beef is your 
choicest meat (6) and is the rib roast, 
to be cooked and canned, or can be 
cut across carefully and put down 
raw (see recipe) for rib beefsteak. 

Now, cutting the last piece in two 
crosswise, we have (7) the chuck 
rib roast to be canned, and (8) the 
neck piece for corning. 

I have not space to describe the 
hind quarter, but it is much the same, 
in reverse order. Of course, all the 
choice expensive beefsteak is in the 
hind quarter, in the part next the 
back, between the rump and the cut 
edge, These are called in order, rump 
steaks, sirloin and porterhouse. The 
rump (above leg, back end) is best 
corned. Below it are the round steaks, 
I would put up raw (see recipe). The 
leg, stew for soups, and the lower in- 
side pieces use for corning or dry- 
ing. If you can afford to buy this 
much meat at once, and have good 
strong help to cut it up and take care 
of it, you will make a very great sav- 
ing in your meat bill and have good 
wholesome meat always ready-to- 
hand in winter, ready for any emer- 
gency without having to run to the 
coiner meat market. Here are my 
i ecipes: 



To Can Meat. 

Cook any fresh meat till perfectly 
tender, slowly and a long time, till it 
falls from the bones. Remove all 
bones. Pack tightly in a sterilized 
glass fruit can. You must have sea- 
soned the meat as for the table with 
salt and pepper, and cooked it down 
till there is very little juice left. Press 
the hot meat down tight and fill clear 
to the neck of the can. Then fill up 
the neck to overflowing with the boil- 
ing juice and seal tight with sterilized 
top and rubber. — Aunt Mary Newton. 

To Keep Raw Beefsteak. 

Cut in slices for the table. Re- 
move all bones (or at least all large 
bones) but put the marrow back in 
the crock. Season good with salt and 
pepper on both sides to make ready 
for the table. Try to sprinkle it even- 
ly all over. Pack very tight in a 
stone crock to exclude all the air. 
Then boil up a thick cloth (at least 
four thicknesses of cheesecloth) in a 
strong brine and wring out when cool, 
and put over the steak. Be sure to 
tuck in all corners to keep the air 
out. If the cloth gets dry boil it up 
as before and put back on. It must 
be damp and cover meat all over. — 
Aunt Mary Newton. 

For Corned Beef or Dried Beef. 

Pack the meat in big crock, keg or 
barrel, cutting it up in convenient 
pieces to use, and putting what you 
wish for dried beef on top. 

For 100 pounds of beef use 9 
pounds of salt, 4 pounds sugar (or 1 
quart molasses) and 4 ounces salt- 
peter, to 6 gallons water. Boil to- 
gether, skim, and turn over the meat 
either hot or cold. Keep meat under 
brine. 

In 10 or 12 days take out the pieces 
you wish to dry, cut them in conven- 
ient sizes, put string through one end 
and hang to dry behind the kitchen 
stove, being sure the pieces do not 
touch each other. Turn and dry em 
hard as you wish. Some smoke meat 
for drying instead of corning it. — 
Mother's recipe. 

In case you wish to keep much 
beefsteak for a long time, it is best 
to use the salt, sugar and saltpeter 
in the proportions just given (leav- 
ing out the water.) Sprinkle the bot- 
tom of a large jar with salt. Lay in 
your steak, sprinkle the mixture over 
it evenly and proceed to fill, trying 
to pack down solid in corners and 
using no water. Put mixture on top, 
and above it a weighted plate filling 
in solidly. This will keep 25 to 30 
pounds of meat perfectly a long time. 
Take out as wanted and fry. — Moth- 
er's recipe. 



SAVING MEAT.

Beef Suet.- — Before cutting up your 
quarter of beef, remove all the suet, 
and add to this any superfluous fat 
you find in cutting up the meat. Chop 
or grind this up, and put in a granite 
kettle on the back of the stove to try 
out slowly. You can pour off the first 
fat that accumulates for your best 
shortening, and then let your scraps 
get quite brown before you press out 
the fat from them through the col- 
ander with a wooden potato masher. 
This last fat will do for frying po- 
tatoes, etc. Or, suet will keep sweet 
for some time if immersed in flour. 

WHAT TO DO WITH HALF A HOG. 

Dear Friends: Today we have half 
a hog to dispose of for winter. So 
many letters are coming in from the 
country that I know this advice will 
be read by many who already under- 
stand it all perfectly, but there are 
many city people who don't and who 
need to practice the great economy 
of putting down their own pork this 
winter, so I shall write very fully 
and plainly for their benefit. 

"W hen a hog is butchered it should 
hang a day or two before it is used. 
Then you will have the head to make 
into head cheese; the liver to fry at 
once; the heart and tongue to boil, 
or to add to your head for head 
cheese, and the lard to try out. I 
would try the leaf lard out sepa- 
rately (as described yesterday for 
suet) and put that away in pails for 
my best company pies, etc., and then 
try the lard from the intestines and 
the extra fat that you cut off in 
putting down your meat, out by it- 
self for ordinary use. Lard costs 
about as much as pork, so don't eat 
more fat with your pork than you 
wish, but fry it out into lard. It will 
keep finely if well covered and set 
in a clean, cool place. 

Now you have your half pig be- 
fore you, on a clean table, inside up, 
with your sharpened, pointed butcher 
knife and meat saw at hand. 

First, I would cut the half hog in 
two crosswise near the middle, for 
convenience in handling. As you ex- 
pect to cut the meat all up, just the 
order in which you do so doesn't 
make much difference, but it would 
probably be handier to cut the fore 
quarter in two now but cutting across 
the ribs, about the middle of the 
quarter, cutting up over and neatly 
around the shoulder. If you want 
more bacon cut higher; if you rather 
have more pork for sausage, or to 
fry or boil and put down, cut lower. 



Now trim out the meat in front of 
the shoulder, and below, around to the 
back, and put this piece in a pan for 
sausage meat. 

Next trim out the shoulder care- 
fully behind, trimming it nice and 
smooth and putting all scraps in the 
sausage pan. 

Now saw off the feet and put in 
water to be cleaned for pickled souse, 
and the shoulder is ready to cure for 
smoking. 

Trim the ham out carefully in the 
same way, putting all scraps with 
the sausage, and cut the remaining 
back piece across crosswise as before. 
These lower pieces are your bacon 
and salt pork, and if your hog was 
large should be cut again in pieces 
easy to handle. Put the hams, shoul- 
ders and bacon now to salt by one of 
the methods described below (I pre- 
fer the dry salt method myself), and 
continue the process, taking care to 
follow the recipe exactly, and you will 
have no trouble. You can easily make 
a smokehouse. A big drygoods box, 
made tight except vent, and set up 
high, with slow fire in old stove be- 
low and smoke carried to the box by 
pipe will do. We used such a con- 
trivance once with good results. Or 
if you wish you can get your butcher 
to smoke the hams, shoulders and 
bacon, after you have them ready 
pickled for him, for a very reason- 
able sum. If you do this mark the 
meat with white twine some way so 
you will know your own. 

We now have all our choice pork 
steak from along the back waiting 
to be taken care of. This you can 
roast and can, or stew and can (by 
cold pack method.) I would use the 
poorest part for more sausage; cut 
the sparerib out and cook it at once 
for dinner, and then cut your fine 
tenderloin up in thin slices, as for 
the table, and pack it down, covered 
with lard, as per recipe below. 

Now you have the sausage to 
grind (after removing all rind) 
through the meat grinder and season 
and pack away (see recipe), the 
head cheese to make (see recipe) and 
the souse to clean and pickle (see 
recipe); and you will find all this 
meat costs you less than half it 
would cost to buy it at retail. 

To Dry-Salt and Smoke Pork. 

Rub coarse salt all over' the meat, 
putting on plenty (too much will not 
hurt the meat, only waste salt), and 
pile it up on a shelf or table, or in a 
box, in a clean, cool, dry place, having

meat covered with salt. Take the 
meat out and turn it once in every 
two or three days, seeing that salt is 
hetween every layer when put back. 
Keep the hams on top, so the weight 
of the other meat won't crowd them 
out of shape. Let the meat lay in the 
dry salt about two weeks, then wipe 
off clean, put away the salt pork 
and smoke the rest. 

In smoking, use hardwood (sweet 
apple wood is the best), or cobs, but 
never any fir wood or any wood that 
has any pitch in it. Fix a smokehouse 
and hang the hams over a small fire, 
burning slowly. Look after your fire 
about three times a day, as needed, 
to keep it going all the while, and 
smoke about 8 or 10 days, depending 
on how much you like it smoked. (As 
told by) Mrs. M. A. Gage, Pioneer 
Farm, Stafford, Or. 

To Cure Hams, Etc., in Brine. 

A good old way: For every ham 
take V 2 lb. each of salt and brown 
sugar; V 2 oz. each of cayenne pepper, 
allspice and saltpeter; mix and rub 
well over the hams, laying them in 
the barrel they are to be kept in, with 
the skin side down. Let them remain 
a week, then make a pickle of water 
and salt strong enough to bear up an 
egg, add to it % lb. sugar and pour 
over the hams till they are thorough- 
ly covered. Let them remain four 
weeks. Take out and hang up to dry 
at least a week before smoking. 

Sweet Pickle for Hams, Etc. 

For 100 lbs. meat use the following: 
8 lbs. salt, 5 lbs. brown sugar, 2 oz. 
soda, 1 oz. saltpeter, 4 gallons soft 
water. Mix all together and put in 
water, then scald, skimming as neces- 
sary, and pour over meat. Leave meat 
in pickle six weeks. — Mrs. O. C. At- 
wood, Benton Harbor, Mich. 

Pigs' Head Cheese, My Own Recipe. 

Have the head split in two. Cut 
off and throw away the end of the 
nose, the jaw bone with teeth, and cut 
out eyes and brain. Cut off ears for 
convenience in cleaning. Singe the 
pieces carefully, and then wash and 
scrape and clean through four or five 
hot waters till perfectly clean, and 
put on to boil slowly. A beef '.ongue 
or heart added to it makes it nicer, as 
it is apt to be too fat for many. The 
pig's feet can also be added, if de- 
sired to increase the quantity, or if 
you wish less, the pig's cheeks (jowls) 
can be cut off and salted and smoked 
with the bacon and make very good 
smoked meat. 

Boil slowly and skim as any scum 
rises, and keep adding water enough 
to keep it covered. When boiled so 
that the flesh leaves the bones, take 
it from the water with a skimmer 



into the chopping bowl. Pick over 
carefully to remove every particle of 
bone, and either chop the meat 
coarsely or pick it to shreds with the 
fingers (I prefer the latter, as it 
holds together better.) 

Add salt and pepper to taste and 
sage, if desired. Spread a cloth over 
the colander or steamer, put the meat 
in after mixing thoroughly, fold the 
cloth closely over it, lay a weight on 
it so that it may press the whole 
surface equally (flatirons or a stone 
on top of a plate the right size-answer 
nicely.) If the meat is desired lean, 
use a heavy weight, if fat use a light- 
er one. When cold, remove and keep 
in a cold place until eaten. Will keep 
two or three days. 

Or you can pack your hot meat, af- 
ter seasoning, into sterilized glass 
cans, pour over it the boiling water 
it was cooked in and seal, and it will 
be fine in winter. 

To Make Sausage. 

For every 12 pounds meat, take 1 
teacup salt, 1% cups pulverized sage, 
8 even teaspoonfuls black pepper, 2 
tablespoonfuls ginger, mix and 
sprinkle over meat before grinding. 
Some add also summer savory. These 
proportions and seasonings can be 
varied to taste. Up to a quarter of 
the bulk of bread crumbs can be add- 
ed just before cooking if desired to 
increase quantity. 

Some other sausage recipes and 
proportions — 1 lb. salt, Vz pt. sage, 
3V& oz. pepper. Mixed and scattered 
ovei 40 lbs. of meat before grinding. 

My Favorite Recipe. 

10 lbs. meat, 4 tablespoonfuls sage, 
1 tablespoonful pepper, 4 tablespoon- 
fuls salt. — Mrs. O. C. Atwood, Benton 
Harbor, Mich. 

To Preserve Sausage or Pork Steak. 

No. 1 — Pack at once, raw, carefully 
into stone crocks or jars, filling every 
crevice full. Then pour boiling lard 
over the top about an inch thick, and 
keep in a cool place. Pork steak 
should have all bones removed and be 
seasoned with salt and pepper and it 
will keep, as well as sausage, in this 
manner, if you add melted lard to 
cover the top, every time you take 
any out. 

However, after a time for some rea- 
son, it may not be keeping so well. 
Watch it closely, and if you fear it 
may not keep sweet much longer, take 
it out and process as follows: 

To Preserve Sausage or Pork Steak. 

No. 2. — Make your sausage into 
flattened balls as for the table and 
fry them about % done. Then pack 
them carefully, and as tight as pos- 
sible without breaking in your stone

crock, and pour over melted lard to 
fill all crevices and cover the top. 
Cover with a plate and set in a cool 
place, and remove as needed, but you 
must heat lard up and pour back each 
time to keep covered with lard as be- 
fore. 

Pickled Souse. 
Take off the horny parts of feet 
and toes, scrape, clean and wash 
thoroughly, singe off the stray hairs. 
Place in a kettle with plenty of water, 
boil, skim, pour off water and add 
fresh and boil until the bones will 
pull out easily; do not bone, but pack 
in a stone jar with pepper and salt 
sprinkled between each layer; mix 
some good cider vinegar with the 
liquor in which they were boiled, us- 
ing 2-3 vinegar to 1-3 liquor, and fill 
up the jar. Take out as wanted. 

Jellied Souse. 

Second way: When the feet have 
boiled until perfectly tender, remove 
all the bones' and pack tight in a 
stone jar, pouring liquid as above 
over to just cover. When wanted for 
use, it will be jellied and can be 
sliced down cold. 

OUR PRICES. 

I have been asked where we get the 
low prices we use in our work by 
readers, who really want to know as 
a help to economical living, and by 
dealers, who ask in a spirit of crit- 
icism. To all I want to say this: 

All recipes in our work are priced 
in accordance with the lowest prices 
on the Portland public market. In 
Portland, as in all other cities, there 
is a wide range in the prices which 
the people pay for food. This is gov- 
erned by many considerations, some 
of which are, first, difference in qual- 
ity. This applies especially in meats. 
The high-priced meats you buy in the 
suburbs are cold storage meats, and 
the very choicest and tenderest meat; 
the meat you buy in the market is 
usually fresh killed by the farmers, 
and perhaps not quite so choice meat; 
yet our Oregon-grown meat, fed on 
the rich pastures of the Willamette 
vallley, ought to equal any meat in 
the world. Then, again, the fresher 
meat, which has not had time to 
"ripen" (or partially decompose) is 
therefore tougher than the "cured" 
meat, but it is certainly as whole- 
some, and is considered by some peo- 
ple to be much more so. A good cook 
can prepare this meat so that it will 
be as tender and palatable as the ex- 
pensive meat, but the inefficient or 
indolent cook is reduced to the ne- 
cessity of always using "prepared or 
cured" meat. Remember one thing 
when your butcher tells you that 
cheap meat is inferior meat, not fit 



for food, that we have a rigid meat 
inspection in Portland, and if this 
cheap meat was unfit for food the 
rival markets would soon see that the 
sale of it was stopped. 

On the other side, we must con- 
sider that all this cheap meat is sold 
for cash, and most of it is not deliv- 
ered — you must carry it home your- 
selves. Here we have two big items 
particularly the former. Those who 
find it so "handy" to order by tele- 
phone and run monthly accounts, 
must remember that there is alyays a 
percentage of loss in all business 
carrying charge accounts, and that in 
order to meet this, and make a fair 
profit, all merchants who run charge 
accounts must charge you more than 
those who do not; but this is not the 
real cost of the food — it is the price 
you pay for having your account car- 
ried, like the interest you pay on a 
loan. 

Then the careful handling and dis- 
playing and the delivering of all gro- 
ceries and meats are expensive. What 
you pay extra for this is paid as you 
would pay a porter to carry a bas- 
ket for you; but it is not the real 
necessary cost of the food. If you 
really wish to live more economical- 
ly, now that the prices of all foods 
are mounting so high, take your mar- 
ket basket and go down to the public 
market some morning and buy some 
meat and groceries, and see how they 
compare in quality and price with 
what you have been paying. It is 
surely an important enough matter, 
so that you should investigate it 
yourself and not take anyone's word 
for it. 

HOW TO CHOOSE AND CARE FOR 
MEAT. 

In choosing meat it should be firm 
to the touch and free from the slight- 
est odor. Beef should be a bright red 
and the fat a rich cream white. 

Veal should have a good pink color, 
and the fat should be white. The calf 
should never be less than six or eight 
weeks old. Younger veal is very un- 
wholesome. Veal requires longer 
cooking than either beef or lamb. 

Pork should be selected with the 
utmost care. Choose meat from a 
young animal and not too fat. Slow, 
thorough cooking is essential. 

Remove all meat from wrapping as 
soon as it is delivered. It should be 
wiped with a clean cloth — not washed 
— and set in a cool place protected 
from insects. — Mrs. S. T. R. 
How to Cook Meat. 

In considering the general subject 
of cooking meats, authorities say that 
heat does not alter the chemical con- 
stituents of food, but when properly 
applied aids digestion; though it 
coagulates and hardens albumin, so 



152 



TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



we sometimes say meats are rendered 
less digestible by cooking. But heat 
is necessary to remove the danger of 
poisonous germs, and a slow moist 
heat softens the fiber of meat making 
it more easily digested. When meat 
is boiled at a gallop the connective 
dissolves, the meat falls from the 
bones and into strings, but the fiber 
is not tender. Such boiled meat is 
leathery and difficult of digestion; 



but meat slowly cooked at a tempera- 
ture of 180 degrees Fahrenheit be- 
comes tender, juicy and easily digest- 
ed, and also more easily masticated. 

Albumin exists in the juices of 
meat as well as in the blood, and un- 
less the outside of each piece is 
coagulated ("sealed over") at once, 
much nourishment is lost, but after 
sealing it, a continued high tempera- 
ture is a disadvantage. 



Beef 



Roast Beef. 

I want to tell you a way I learned 
to cook roast beef many years ago, 
at a cooking school conducted in con- 
nection with a farmers' institute in 
the East, as it made roast beef the 
favorite meat for my husband and 
sons. 

Buy a rib roast of good size, even 
if the family is small. A good-sized 
roast will be so much more juicy in 
the center, and is always good to 
warm over, or to eat cold. I do not 
believe there is any other meat from 
which we get as much nourishment 
for the money invested. We can ge.t 
a good rib roast for 15c per lb., bones 
and all, or 20 cents per lb. rolled. If 
you don't care to use the bones for 
soup the latter is the cheapest way to 
buy it. I weighed it, to be sure. But 
I always have mine rolled and bring 
home the bones for a vegetable soup 
to precede, and take the place of so 
much meat. 

I know many women cook it as I 
do, but some don't, so I will risk 
"carrying coals to Newcastle" in de- 
scribing my process. 

Take a sheetiron dripping pan and 
put it, clean and with nothing at all 
in it, over the gas to heat. Light the 
oven, turning on full heat. See that 
your roast is tied firmly and is 
smooth at both ends. When the drip- 
ping pan is blue hot set one raw end 
of the roast on the blue spot and let 
it sear. As soon as it sears over it 
will loosen up. Now turn it, and sear 
the other raw end, and after that any 
raw strip down the length that may 
not be covered with the envelope of 
fat. As soon as it is all seared over 
put it in the pan and immediately into 
your hot oven, and let it cook for a 
few moments there, then reduce the 
heat just enough so that it does not 
burn, and yet the oven is hot enough 
to keep any juice from escaping. Turn 
it occasionally and let it bake 15 or 20 
minutes to the pound, depending on 
whether you like it rare or well done. 
Serve on hot platter, garnish and send 
to the table just as it is. Use no salt. 



no pepper, no butter, no flour, no 
water — absolutely nothing but meat 
and heat. You will be amazed, if you 
don't cook it that way now, to find 
how good it is — how the natural salts 
and flavor of the meat are all re- 
tained, so you can hardly believe it 
has not been salted. The only trouble 
in cooking meat this way is that there 
is no gravy. There should not be a 
teaspoonful of juice escape if it is 
cooked right. If you want to pare 
potatoes and brown them in the pan 
with it, as my family like, you will 
need to add a little shortening to the 
pan to turn the potatoes in. No other 
way of cooking that I have tried con- 
serves all the juices and goodness of 
the meat as this does, and so in no 
other way is the meat rendered so 
tender and palatable.

Meat with a small piece of suet 
should be selected. Try out to make 
sufficient grease to brown ingredi- 
ents. Cut meat in medium-sized 
cubes, carrots, onions and turnips in 
thick rounds. Care should be taken 
that ingredients do not burn, but they 
should have a rich brown surface, for 
this is the secret of the gravy. All 
ingredients to be browned should be 
first rolled in the flour. Put every- 
thing into tightly covered casserole, 
placing potatoes on top, as they may 
break up if underneath. Water to 
cover all but the potatoes should be 
added last thing. Fifteen minutes 
before serving time add balance of 
flour, stirred to a thin paste with a 
little cold water. Cook very slowly. 

In both these dishes I have includ- 
ed current for the full time of cook- 
ing but my oven is something like a 
fireless cooker, and the actual cur- 
rent consumed in each case should 
not be more than % of the time I have 
given. I do not know if all electric 
ovens are like mine, so did not make 
this allowance. — Mrs. A. H. Pope, 1285

they are so much nicer and more nu- 
tritious than the boughten ones. 

Make noodles as follows: Beat two 
eggs light, add M t salt, stir into 1 c 
flour to form a stiff dough roll out 
in a very thin sheet, dredge with flour 
to keep from sticking, leave on the 
board to dry. Then cut with a sharp

there should be one quart of gravy. 
Thicken this with half cup of flour 
stirred smooth in half cup cold water. 
This is sufficient to serve six people 
two meals. I do not like too small a 
roast, as it dries out too much, so I 
take the cold meat the following day 
and make croquettes.

them in the kettle. Pour over the 
tomato with vegetables. Set the ket-

Cook gently over low heat IY2 hours, 
adding boiling water as needed to

garnished with fresh green parsley.

Round Steak Roast. 

Mrs. Roberts says: Here are a few 
recipes for next week: I sincerely 
hope you will make up a cook book 
of all the nice recipes you are getting 
together.

2 T flour 0018 

2 T butter 0315 

1 hour to bake in gas oven 0255 

Cost $0.5106 

Sear steak in a tablespoonful fat, 
sprinkle with salt, roll in flour and 
put in a roaster. Cover with thick 
slices of potatoes, 3 onions sliced and 
three green sweet peppers cut in 
strips. Sprinkle all with salt, pepper 
and flour, dot with pieces of butter. 
Add the pint of water and bake one 
hour in a covered roaster. Thicken 
the gravy, serve with roast. 

To Cook Beefsteak. 

With a sharp knife remove fat and 
all stringy substances which prevent 
the steak from lying flat while cook- 
ing. Pound steak with smooth wood- 
en mallet, or its equivalent, crosswise 
the grain. Have a hot fire with plenty 
of coals. Put enough suet in an iron 
spider to grease it well, adding more 
as necessity requires. When the 
spider is real hot, put in one or two 
pieces, according to your heat (do not 
cook enough at one time to cool the 
spider), count ten and turn, lifting 
with a knife and fork, repeating until 
cooked to suit the taste, rare or well 
done, lift from the spider carefully, 
placing on hot platter, turn on hot 
suet, salt and butter, which will make 
a lich gravy. Serve on hot plates. 
The secret of a good steak is not to 
let the juice get started with cook- 
ing. Never put on salt until the steak 
is cooked. (Venison may be cooked 
the same way.) — Mary E. Heston.

cut into pieces for serving. 

Fry sliced onions in 2 T of drip- 
pings, in iron skillet, until brown, 
then remove from skillet. Add other 

2 T of drippings and fry meat on both 
sides until brown. Add boiling water 
to rear cover, put on tight cover and 
simmer for about two hours, replen- 
ishing water and turning as neces- 
sary. At the end of two hours add 
tomatoes and onions, paprika and a 
little cayenne and cook until meat is 
very tender and sauce a dark brown. 
Serve in the sauce. If a hot dish is 
liked add more cayenne. This can be 
cooked in casserole after browning 
the meat in skillet if desired. Try 
this once and you will cook it often. —

Smothered Steak 

I am sending two recipes for the 
preparation of round steak, which 
are entered for first prize.

% t pepper 0021 

Wood fuel (V 2 time) 2 hours .. .0340 

Cost to serve 6 persons ....$0.3764 



Or about 6 cents each. 

Remove fat from the bone and the 
steak and try out in oven, rejecting 
cracklings left. Season meat well on 
both sides with salt and pepper. Have 
skillet and fat very hot and brown 
the meat quickly. Then cover the 
steak with the onions put through 
the food chopper and cover these 
with the carrots also ground, and 
season lightly with salt and pepper. 
Put in enough water to nearly cover 
and put a close-fitting lid on the 
skillet. Bake an hour and a half in 
not too hot an oven. This is a fa- 
vorite recipe with us, and may be 
varied by adding a can of tomatoes 
and less water, but we generally 
prefer it as given. It is ample for six 
large portions and is very filling. It 
is always best to have a good thick 
steak and use only a part in the 
above manner, reserving a portion for 
the next day for stews, meat cakes, 
etc., if one doesn't wish to use more 
than the amount given at a meal. —

Crisp corn flakes in the oven and 
crush. Cut the steak into the de- 
sired sizes, salt and pepper to taste, 
dip in the beaten egg and then in the 
corn flakes. Have drippings or fry- 
ing fat, etc., quite hot and fry steak 
until a nice brown, taking care not 
to burn, as it is very easy to do that 
with corn flakes. I usually fry both 
sides a golden brown and put it back 
to finish cooking on the back of the 
stove. The corn flakes impart a de- 
licious flavor not to be obtained in 
any other way. I often substitute 
them in meat loaf, meat patties, cro- 
quettes and escalloped foods for 
cracker or bread crumbs and find it 
a welcome change. Mrs. A. L. Adams,

atable each day. The only objection 
is that Mr. Hoover does not want us 
to eat veal. Could not this be made 
as well with a good roasting piece of 
beef?) 

How to serve five people three din- 
ners and one soup with a five-pound 
roast of veal. Use rump or leg roast. 
Rub with salt, pepper and small piece 
of butter. Dredge with two table- 
spoonfuls flour, put in roasting pan 
with one pint water. Watch carefully 
until brown. Then add one quart 
boiling water and cook until done. 
The result will be a nicely browned, 
juicy roast with plenty of good gravy. 
We serve five grown people one lib- 
eral helping each. Put remnants in 
covered dish and keep in cool place. 

Next day cut meat from bones and 
divide in two equal parts. Put bones, 
skin and bits of gristle in a kettle of 
water on back of stove to simmer, 
use one part of the left-over meat, 
diced, and 1 onion and 3 potatoes, cut 
in cubes. Any left-over tomatoes 
cooked or raw will add to the flavor. 
Butter the casserole and alternate the 
ingredients with a slight dredging of 
flour, salt, pepper and bits of butter. 
Almost cover with water, put bread 
crumbs on top and bake till gravy 
is thick and serve.

Third day break enough stale bread 
in water or milk to make one large 
cup. Put meat, 1 onion and any left- 
over hash through meat grinder, sea- 
son with salt, pepper, sage, celery 
seed and paprika, 1 tablespoonful 
melted butter and 1 egg. Stuff green 
peppers with this mixture, cover each 
one with cracker crumbs and bake in 
buttered casserole till done, then re- 
move lid and brown. This amount 
will stuff six good-sized peppers. 

Strain the soup stock you had sim- 
mering and add any vegetables on 
hand and V2 c barley. One cupful of 
tomatoes is indispensable to make 
this a very delicious soup. If there is 
no immediate use for the soup it may 
be canned while boiling hot and put 
up for winter use. — Mrs. Hugh Lati- 
mer, 768 Johnson street. 

Note. — In regard to Mrs. Hugh Lat- 
imer's recipe for the veal cooked in 
so many different ways from the 
same roast, that we found so com- 
mendable except that Mr. Hoover does 
not want us to use veal at all, Mrs. 
Latimer writes: 

"You are quite right. Beef may be 
used instead of veal, and when pep- 
pers are gone the same filling may 
be made into croquettes, rolled in 
eggs and cracker crumbs and fried in 
deep fat."

Veal Steak. 

Mrs. Parks says: I send today my 
best recipe for cooking veal and pork. 
I have used them for years, and it is 
worth others' while to give them a 
trial. Take veal steak and cut in nice 
pieces, beat one egg and add little 
milk and salt and pepper; dip veal in 
egg and roll in fine cracker crumbs; 
have a heavy skillet, with lard, quite 
hot; brown one side and turn over and 
brown the other well; then have boil- 
ing water and fill skillet with the 
water; cover and cook almost an hour, 
putting in more water if needed; let 
all the water boil out, then add a 
tablespoonful of flour, milk and some 
water for gravy, with salt and pepper.

onion, salt and pepper. Mix and add 
soup stock to moisten. Lay a spoon- 
ful on the squares, roll up and fasten 
with toothpicks. Put in pan and

Cut meat in small pieces, slice to- 
mato, cut onion and celery into small 
pieces. Put all into casserole, with the 
exception of flour, and bake; about 
15 minutes before time is up, add 
flour stirred to a thin paste with a 
little water. About 4 cupfuls of wa- 
ter should be put into dish with meat. 
Cook slowly. — Mrs. A. H. Pope, 1285

ing lamb, as these two meats are the 
ones Mr. Hoover does not want us to 
cook at all. However, that is but 
temporary — during the war, which we 
all hope will be over before many 
months, and these economy recipes we 
will want to keep and use for years,

Meat Substitutes as a Health Necessity 



Dear Friends: In beginning our 
last week's work on meat substitutes 
I want to tell you a little of what I 
have been reading- about giving up 
the use of meat as a health necessity. 
We often read a vague reference to 
a meat diet as harmful, but the num- 
ber of people — particularly men — who 
are suffering with heart trouble, 
hardening of the arteries, Bright's 
disease, etc., in middle age is appall- 
ing, and Dr. Louis Faugeres Bishop 
(with all kinds of letters after his 
name) and professor of heart and cir- 
culatory diseases in Fordham univer- 
sity, tells us that this class of dis- 
eases is now claiming twice as many 
victims as it did 30 years ago, and 
from those who can least be spared 
by their families and the state. "One 
has only to read the morning papers 
to note the number of men and wom- 
en — unfortunately most often those 
living at high pressure in solving 
some of the problems of our complex 
civilization — who are cut down with- 
out warning. 

"In a double sense, the way to a 
man's heart is by the food he is given, 
and the more elaborate the food the 
more quickly does his heart succumb 
to the strain put upon it. So it falls 
upon the woman to meet this condi- 
tion and without delay. 

"The insidiousness of auto-intoxi- 
cation is that it runs on for some 
time without showing any outward 
effect, so that food poisoning has gen- 
erally existed for five or ten years 
before the heart is sufficiently dam- 
aged to cause distress or exertion, and 
it is very hard to persuade a sick per- 
son who does not feel any discomfort 
from his high blood pressure, or leak- 
ing heart, that a change of diet is 
essential. 

"It has been found that, under cer- 
tain circumstances, the cells of the 
body become sensitive to the protein 
element of certain kinds of foods, and 
from that time on, as long as this 
sensitiveness lasts, that kind of food 
acts as a poison to the cells of the 
body. The only way to limit the 
damage is to exclude the offending 
article of food from the diet. Another 
important point in the matter is that 
when a person is sensitive to a par- 
ticular kind of food the cells are al- 
most as much irritated by a little of 



this food as by a great deal, so that t 
a diet, to be of much use, has to be 
a strict diet. Many failures can be 
laid at the door of a slight indulgence 
in the type of food to which the per- 
son is sensitive. It is hard to believe 
that a little will do any harm, or that 
food damage can be entirely inde- 
pendent of any discomfort, but such 
is the case. The things that do dam- 
age are usually found in the group 
including eggs, fish, meat and stock 
soups (made from meat), but there is 
no definite way of determining which 
of these things are at fault. This has 
to be accomplished by the study of 
each individual person by means of 
the absolute withdrawal of all those 
things until there is an improvement 
in the action of the heart and blood 
vessels. Now one article of food, and 
then another, is added to the diet, and 
it is discovered by experiment which 
one the person can use without a re- 
turn of the disorder. It may be only 
eggs, or fish, or meat, in the begin- 
ning that causes trouble, but in per- 
sons seriously ill with hardening of 
the arteries all these things cause 
trouble and must be absolutely elim- 
inated from the diet." 

One of our kitchen visitors told me 
that she had eaten no meat or soup 
from meat, or red fish, or carrots, in 
two years, and was nearly cured of 
her heart trouble. Cheese and nut 
dishes are the very things, with good 
vegetables and fruits and breads, that 
people suffering from heart derange- 
ment should use as articles of diet. 
And for all of us in middle life who 
feel "under the weather" and op- 
pressed, without exactly knowing 
what is the matter with us, it is sure- 
ly worth while to try for a month 
leaving meat, fish, eggs and soup out 
of our diet altogether, and see if we 
don't feel better. If we do we know 
that some one of these has been poi- 
soning us — probably not all of them, 
however — and we can try eating eggs 
and see if we feel any worse, etc. It 
for 25 years, that a middle-aged per- 
son of good, sound, common sense 
is far more likely to be able to locate 
a chronic trouble for himself if he 
sets his mind to it than the average 
"reputable physician" can do for him.

Using Vegetables Instead of Meat. 

Here are some general remarks on 
vegetable eating by Mrs. Sarah Tyson 
Rorer. I wish I had space for more, 
as what she says is surely worth our 
consideration. 

The American people, as a class, in 
their rushing and bustling life, pre- 
fer to take their nitrogen from ani- 
mal products, which are rather more 
easily digested and assimilated than 
vegetables. It is a fact, however, that 
all the elements necessary for the 
building of the body are found in the 
vegetable world. Our working ani- 
mals, "beasts of burden," build and 
repair their large bodies, under heavy 
labor, on materials from the vegetable 
kingdom. True, their digestive ap- 
paratus is rather different from 
man's, and is better suited to the dry, 
concentrated cereals. We do not, how- 
ever get from the animal a single 
element except that which the ani- 
mal has taken from the vegetable 
world. His flesh is the result of the 
digestion of vegetable materials. 

Meat is rich in water, containing 
less nitrogen than peas, beans and 
lentils, but in a more acceptable form 
to American and English business 
men or teachers who spend most of 
their lives in close, ill-ventilated 
rooms. There are many sides to the 
vegetarian question worthy of con- 
sideration. 

The true vegetarian uses all forms 
of vegetable foods; he does not try 
to live upon potatoes and so-called 
green or succulent vegetables. These 
do not contain nitrogen, and are in- 
sufficient to sustain life. Nuts well 
prepared and mixed with cereals, and 
such easily digested foods as rice 
give sustaining power not attainable 
by meat. Health and nutrition de- 
pend entirely upon the class of vege- 
tables selected. The Japanese, who 
do in their country the work per- 
formed by horses here, are practical- 
ly vegetarians. 

Nitrogeneous vegetables are slow of 
digestion; hence, the vegetarian re- 
quires but two meals per day; but in 
those two meals, especially if his diet 
is well selected, he will receive more 
nourishment than from three meals 
of meat. Two points have been 
gained, time spent in eating and 
money saved. Then, too, he has had 
much greater variety. The vegetarian 
is not compelled to eat steaks, chops; 
and roasted beef to be followed by 
roasted beef, steaks and chops; but 
selects from a score of dishes made 
by blending different vegetables, nuts 
and fruits. 



The amount of cellulose or waste in 
vegetable foods keeps up the peri- 
staltic motion of the intestines and 
lower bowels; hence, vegetable eaters 
are very rarely troubled with consti- 
pation and torpid livers. Skin dis- 
eases are frequently due to a lack of 
green vegetables. 

An observer can readily understand, 
however,, why we have grown into 
a meat-eating nation. A short visit 
into the house of a neighbor makes 
this point quite plain. The so-called 
cook, an uneducated woman, who is 
perhaps a second rate scullery maid, 
presides over the kitchen. She does 
not know the chemical composition of 
a single article she cooks, nor the ef- 
fect of heat upon them. She does 
know how to cook meats; they can 
be broiled or roasted. These two 
methods form the limit of her horizon. 
Broiling intensifies the flavor of 
steak, and with a little seasoning of 
salt and pepper, and a bunch of pars- 
ley, makes a palatable and sightly 
dish. The cook has given it little care 
and less thought. Not so with vege- 
tables; they owe their flavor to vola- 
tile oils which are easily dissipated 
by careless or rapid cooking. Badly 
cooked vegetables are tasteless; all 
the flavor has been cooked out and 
poured down the drain. Potatoes, a 
common vegetable, served in nearly 
every household once or twice a day, 
are seldom well cooked, palatable or 
sightly. Rice is almost unfit for 
food; in nine cases out of ten it is 
yellow, not white, heavy and sod- 
den, a mass of wet starch. Few things 
show the difference between com- 
fortable and slovenly housekeeping 
more quickly than the dressing of 
vegetables. 

Cooking Vegetables. 

Mrs. Spencer, 1260 East Davis 
street, city, says: I suppose most 
of the readers will think that this 
week's work is easy and simple, as it 
is just vegetables, but I know that a 
great many people spoil the best 
vegetables by cooking in too much 
water and then draining it off, there- 
by losing all the juices and the very 
essence of the vegetables. It seems 
to me this is one of the most essen- 
tial things in the art of cooking. For 
instance, I have noticed the difference 
in greeen peas or string beans, and 
can tell if they have been cooked in 
a large quantity of water or sim- 
mered down till there is very little of 
the liquor left — there is no compari- 
son in the taste. Green vegetables 
should be thoroughly washed in cold 
water, then dropped into water that is 
just beginning to boil. There should

be one tablespoonful of salt to two 
quarts of water. If the water boils 
long before the vegetables are put in, 
it has lost all its gases, and the min- 
eral ingredients are deposited on the 
bottom and side of the kettle, so that 
the water is flat and tasteless; then 
the vegetables will not look well or 
have a fine flavor. Time for cook- 
ing depends upon the age and time 
they have been gathered. 

Third Prize — For the best and most 
complete condensed list of general in- 
formation on how to best prepare and 
serve each common vegetable to con- 
serve all its flavor and food value, 
prize was won by Mrs. John Oatfield, 
Milwaukie, Or., with the following 
table of condensed directions: 

Cooking Vegetables. 

Boil one hour — Carrots, green 
beans, celery, turnips. Cook with 
boiling water. Reduce water to be 
thickened for sauce or drain and 
serve with butter or milk sauce. 

Boil one hour — Cabbage, onions, 
beets (cook in skins.) Plunge in ket- 
tle of boiling water well covered. 
Strong vegetables are sometimes 
drained and recovered. Cabbage best 
cooked uncovered to eliminate strong 
odors. Leave beet stems on to avoid 
bleeding, serve buttered or as pickles. 

Boil one-half hour — Spinach, tur- 
nip tops, curly kale. Add small quan- 
tity of wate~ to conserve salts. Drain 
and mince, season with butter or 
drippings. 

Boil one-half hour — Cauliflower, 
Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, 
summer squash. 

Cook one-half hour — Tomatoes. Add 
no water. Season with salt, pepper, 
a little sugar, butter. 

Cook two hours — Hubbard squash 
(baked.) Split open, remove seeds, 
bake in oven, when half done dust 
over salt, sugar, pepper and cut in 
small serving pieces, a little butter to 
each piece. 

Onions, carrots, parsnips may be 
baked with roast. Turnips, parsnips, 
squash may be mashed, milk and sea- 
soning added. — Mrs. John Oatfield, 
Milwaukie, Or. 

How to Prepare Vegetables. 

Strong flavored vegetables, like 
turnips, cabbage and greens, require 
to be put into a large quantity of 
"water. 

More delicate vegetables, such as 
peas, asparagus, etc., require less 



water. Let water boil before putting 
in and continue to boil until done. 

Never let vegetables stand in the 
water after coming off the fire. If 
not ready to serve, place in colander 
over pot of boiling water. An iron 
pot will spoil color of greens. 

Potatoes are good with all meats. 

Greens, cabbage, carrots, turnips 
and parsnips are served with boiled 
meats. 

Beets, beans and peas are served 
with either boiled or roast meats. 

Steam summer squash. 

Soak eggplant in salt water over 
night. 

One-half teaspoonful sugar added 
to onions, peas, parsnips and carrots 
while boiling add greatly to their 
flavor. 

Grease with lard the outside of po- 
tatoes before baking. 

Core apples and cook; put through 
fruit press before adding sugar for 
sauce. 

Bake beans in the water in which 
they are parboiled as this is the se- 
cret of nutritious beans. — Florence H. 
Dusenberry, "Westport, Wash. 

Rules for Handling Vegetables. 

"Wash thoroughly, pare and scrape, 
if skins must be removed. Keep in 
cold water until cooked to keep them 
crisp and to prevent their being dis- 
colored. Cook in boiling water; the 
water must be kept at the boiling 
point. Use two teaspoonfuls salt with 
two quarts water. Put salt in water 
when the vegetables are partly 
cooked. The water in which vege- 
tables are cooked is called vegetable 
stock. 

Fresh green vegetables require less 
water than others. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and 
turnips should be cooked uncovered 
in a large amount of water. 

All vegetables must be drained as 
soon as tender. Season with salt and 
pepper and serve hot with butter or 
sauce. Cold vegetables may be used 
for salads or may be placed in a bak- 
ing dish with one-half the quantity 
of sauce (2 c vegetables and 1 c 
sauce), covered with buttered crumbs 
and .browned in a hot oven. — Mrs. H. 
G. Thyng, 326 East Mohawk street, 
St. Johns. 

Vegetable Cooking. 

All vegetables growing beneath the 
ground should be cleaned by putting 
in cold water and scrubbing with a 
small brush. Unless a vegetable is 
dried or wilted, it should not be

soaked in water for any length of 
time before cooking. 

To retain flavor in vegetables, use 
the boiling method for one way — tur- 
nips, kohl-rabi, carrots, parsnips, 
sweet potatoes and celery may all be 
cooked in this way. In so doing vege- 
tables may be cooked in the morning 
and quickly reheated for dinner in 
the evening. 

In boiling have a large saucepan of 
water on the stove (rain water Is 
best) when it comes to a rapid boil, 
drop in the vegetables (with skins) 
large ones first, see that this comes to 
a boil again as soon as possible, then 
add salt, one teaspoonful to every 
quart of water used. Continue cook- 
ing gently, partly uncovered till ten- 
der (use a silver fork for testing.) 
Do not allow vegetables to stop boil- 
ing before they are tender, also do 
not let them stand in water after 
they are tender. Drain at once and 
cover with cold water two or three 
times, when cooled peel and dice. Or 
if you do not wish to serve them 
right away keep in a covered dish to 
avoid drying. The following recipe 
for sauce may be used with either of 
the vegetables mentioned above: 

White Sauce. 

Cost. 

1 T butter $0.0156 

1 T flour 0009 

1/2 t salt 0003 

1 c milk 0268 

Cost $0.0436 

This sauce will cover a pint of 
vegetables. Heat the butter, add flour 
and stir until smooth, then add the 
milk, stirring all the time. When the 
sauce boils add salt and the prepared 
vegetables. Cook 10 minutes and 
serve. 

All the above-mentioned vegetables 
will cook in 30 minutes if young and 
fresh, old ones require longer cook- 
ing. Beets always require the boiling 
method. Care must be taken in 
washing them not to break any roots 
or stems to avoid their bleeding. 
Young beets will cook in one hour, 
old ones take from 3 to 4 hours. Do' 
not serve beets with white sauce, use 
butter, salt and pepper or pickle them. 

The steaming method is perhaps the 
best. Peel or scrape (real fine) the 
vegetables above mentioned (all ex- 
cept beets), potatoes, cauliflower, 
cabbage, pumpkin, squash and young 
spinach may all be steam cooked. 
All but pumpkin, squash and spin- 
ach may be served with the sauce 
given above, or it can be made by us- 
ing meat stock Instead of milk. Serve 
pumpkin, squash and spinach with 
butter, salt and pepper. There are 
many different ways of serving vege- 
tables, too many to mention them all. 



To cook tomatoes, wash, pour boil- 
ing water over them, let stand 2 or 
3 minutes, drain off and cover with 
cold water, pour off again and peel. 
Cut large tomatoes in fourths, small 
ones in halves. Put into a stewpan 
on the stove, boil gently 20 minutes 
or half an hour. Season five minutes 
before cooking is finished. Allow for 
each quart of tomatoes 1 teaspoonful 
salt, 1 teaspoonful sugar and 1 table- 
spoonful of butter. To cook onions,

The Best Ways to Cook Vegetables. 

Mrs. Dittmar says: I am sending 
in a few of my recipes and ways of 
cooking vegetables. I want to add 
that I save all stock from vegetables 
cooked, and make delicious soups 
from them. I want to thank you for 
the many good recipes that are com- 
ing through your kitchn; every one 
of them is good, and gives us all a 
chance to try some one else's way — 
like going out to dinner. 
The Best Way to Cook Vegetables. 

To boil potatoes put on in cold 
water allow one T salt to each qt. 
water, boil until a fork penetrates 
them easily, then drain, return to 
stove, let stand a moment, take up 
sauce pan, shake gently, take off 
cover to let steam escape, repeat pro- 
cess two or three times when pota- 
toes will be nice and mealy. 

Tomatoes — Cover with boiling wa- 
ter for a moment, then remove skins, 
cut in quarters, place in saucepan 
with no water. Add seasoning, also 
some sugar and butter. Cook 20 min- 
utes and serve. 

Asparagus — Peel and wash, tie in 
bundles heads all one way, ends cut 
even. Place in saucepan, cover with 
boiling water and cook 25 minutes. 
Add salt, draw to the back of the 
stove, let simmer 5 minutes, lift out 
and drain. Arrange on hot dish, re- 
move strings and pour melted butter 
over it. 

Cabbage — Cut in quarters, remove 
core, wash and place in saucepan, 
nearly cover with boiling water, cook 
until done. Add salt and simmer 10 
minutes, drain, serve with melted but- 
ter or any other way you serve. 

Kale — Strip leaves from stems, 
wash thoroughly, put in boiling wa- 
ter, boil for 10 minutes, drain and re- 
turn to saucepan and cover with fresh

boiling water. Boil until done and 
finish in any of the many ways pre- 
ferred. 

Spinach — Strip from stalks, wash 
well, cover with boiling water, add 
salt, boil 15 or 20 minutes, drain (it 
should be very dry), chop very fine, 
pour over it melted butter and gar- 
nish with hard-boiled eggs, cut in 
quarters. 

Swiss chard — The leaves from Swiss 
chard can be cooked like spinach and 
finished the same or with a white 
cream sauce. Stems of chard can be 
bunched and cooked like asparagus, 
or cut in inch pieces and boiled and 
finished a la creme. 

Cauliflower can be cooked in one 
piece, or separate the roses. Wash 
well in cold water and boil, putting 
them on in boiling water, cook till 
tender, adding the salt the last few 
minutes. Serve with melted butter 
or cream sauce. 

String beans — Wash well, cut off 
ends, remove strings, cut slantingly 
into fine slices, place in sauce pan 
with boiling water and salt, boil till 
tender, let water boil away all it will 
by boiling without a cover. Add a 
piece of butter and chopped parsley 
and serve. 

Peas— Shell and wash, put on in 
boiling water barely enough to cover, 
add a little sugar and boil about 12 
minutes, letting the water boil 
down. Add a few tablespoonfuls of 
cream, seasoning and a very little 
butter. 

We prefer all our vegetables cooked 
and served plain with the addition 
of a little butter, as nearly all sauces 
tend to lessen the flavor of the vege- 
table. — Mrs. M. E. Dittmar, 971 East 
Taylor street, city. 

General Suggestions on Cooking 
Vegetables. 

Beets pared and shaved on a 
grater and boiled in a small amount 
of water, cooked nearly dry and a 
little vinegar added have a good 
color and a fine flavor. 

Squash is fine, cut in half, and 
baked for hours with a filling of any 
kind of meat or meat substitute. 

Ripe sweet corn parched and 
ground fine may be eaten with milk. 

Wheat or barley is good as It is 
if boiled all day. — Mrs. S. T. Walker, 
box 215, Forest Grove, Or.

carrots and potatoes and celery, cook 
together (boiling them for 10 min- 
utes.) Make a pie crust as follows: 
Take 2 cups flour, 2 T lard, 1 t bak- 
ing powder, half t salt. Rub the lard 
into the flour which has been sifted 
with the baking powder and salt; mix 
with one cup of cold water to about 
the consistency of biscuit dough. Line 
the sides of a good-sized granite drip- 
ping pan with strips of the dough. 
Put alternate layers of the vegetables 
and seasoning; moisten the edges 
with water, roll out remainder of 
dough one-eighth of an inch thick, 
and put a small cup in center of pie 
to hold up top crust. Now put on top 
crust (press edges with a fork), brush 
over with milk and bake in hot oven 
30 minutes. This is delicious and 
enough for seven people, a splended

Or 3 cents each. 

Add apple (cut fine) to kraut, cover 
with boiling water. Let water reduce 
to minimum the last half hour, add 
drippings. The apple eliminates ex- 
cess acid and adds flavor. Sauer kraut 
needs long, slow boiling to be diges- 
tible when cooked. Otherwise serve 
raw as salad with a little olive oil. 

Serve with pork of any kind. I 
sometimes steam pork sausages with 
the sauer kraut. — Mrs. John Oatfield,

To Cook Sauer Kraut. 

On cold days, sauer kraut, with or 
without wieners and dumplings tastes 
pretty good. Take two pounds sauer 
kraut, season with salt and pepper 
and cook with a very little water, 
shaking often to prevent sticking. 
Add the wieners after it starts boil- 
ing. I think everybody knows how 
to make dumplings and creamed po- 
tatoes. I drop the dough by spoonfuls 
and steam until done. — Mrs. J. Hen-

Boil the potatoes in their skins,

the bread (which should be at least 
24 hours old) and grate into the 
grated potatoes. Now take the other 
half of the bread and cut into tiny 
cubes, as for crotons, and add to the 
melted fat and fry until crisp and 
brown, and add to the potatoes. Next 
add flour, salt, nutmeg and well-

ing- a few minutes, raise them up with 
a spoon, so that they won't stick to 
the bottom of the kettle; serve with 
meat and gravy; but they are best

To Make Potato Starch. 

If the water which was drained off 
the raw grated potatoes is allowed to 
settle, about a cupful of potato 
starch will be found in the bottom of 
the dish. Several changes of water 
should be put on this starch until it 
is perfectly clean and pure white; 
then it may be dried and used in 
place of corn starch for thickening 
soups, etc. — Mrs. Nat Smythe.

slowly, so as to keep grains separate. 
Boil steadily for 20 minutes, take 
from the fire and drain off the water. 
Place the saucepan with the cover 
partly off on the back of the stove, 
where it is moderately warm, and al-

Making Salads 



Authorities say that the term salad 
is applied to certain cold dishes com- 
posed either of meat, fish or vegeta- 
bles, which for generations have been 
served with a mixture of oil and vine- 
gar, or oil, egg and vinegar. The oil 
furnishes the fatty matter for the 
meal, and being purely vegetable is 
more wholesome than the ordinary 
animal fats. (Please notice this and 
"save the fat" by using all the vege- 
table oils you can in their place). 

A mixture of fruits with mayon- 
naise dressing, served -as a salad, is, 
according to Mrs. Rorer, "unsightly, 
unpalatable and a little nauseating." 
One cannot think of anything more 
out of keeping than white grapes in 
a thick mayonnaise. The simple, so- 
called French dressing is delicate and 
most worthy of recommendation. Over 
lettuce, cress or celery it makes a 
palatable and wholesome dinner salad, 
and one in which children can be 
freely indulged. Such fruits as ap- 
ples, pears, cherries and pineapples, 
mixed with celery or lettuce, with 
French dressing, make an agreeable 
(and inexpensive) dinner salad. A 
simple salad should be seen on every 
dinner table 365 times in the year. 
Persons living in the country or in 
the outskirts of towns can without 
cost always pick sorrel, long dock, 
dandelions and lambsquarter, and the 
vegetables from our war gardens are 
now always with us. Besides all our 
canned vegetables, and those we can 
use cooked, parsley is green the year 
'round. Cabbage, celery and onions 
are ready at any time. I have green 
cucumbers, lettuce and beans and ripe 
tomatoes out in the garden as I write 
(November 12). There is no reason 
why we of the warm, fertile Willam- 
ette valley should not have salads 
from our own war gardens the year 
'round, and a salad is far superior to 
a dessert as the closing of a dinner. 
"The happiest closing to a real good 
dinner is a crisp salad, well dressed, 
s^rvpd with a bit of cheese and bread 
and butter or toasted cracker." 

The green vegetables contain the 
salts necessary to the well-being of 
our blood, and oil is an essential and 
important food. The garlic and vine- 
gar aid in the digestion and assimi- 
lation of other foods, but we must be 
very careful in the use of garlic. It 
should never be served cut up in a 
salad, but in one bottle put a few 
cloves of garlic and cover with vine- 



gar, in another some celery seed cov- 
ered with vinegar, or mint in vinegar, 
etc., and use this vinegar for salads. 

In making salads the materials 
must be carefully washed in very cold 
water and shaken dry in a wire bas- 
ket, or wiped with soft cheesecloth, 
or the dressing will not blend proper- 
ly. Never cut lettuce with a knife — 
pull it apart with the fingers. 

The ideal way to mix a French 
salad is at the table. Just before 
serving sprinkle the salt and pepper 
over the crisp green vegetables, then 
pour over the required quantity of oil 
and turn or toss with the fork and 
spoon until every piece is evenly cov- 
ered. Now add the vinegar and toss 
and turn again until the whole is 
evenly distributed, and serve at once. 
The old Spanish proverb expresses the 
salad ideal of many generations: "A 
spendthrift for oil, a miser for vine- 
gar and a madman to stir it up." 

As a general rule, meat salads are 
the best with mayonnaise, vegetables 
with French dressing, though there 
are exceptions. Of course, meat sal- 
ads have a decided food value, and 
in a luncheon take the place of the 
meat. I feel that I was too critical 
of Mrs. Jones' fish salad yesterday, 
but the news just now from Russia 
makes one feel pessimistic, though 
some women do not seem to have 
realized yet that we really are at war. 

Storagre of "Vegetables. 

Carrots and Beets — Dig before hard 
frost. Buried in sand will keep until 
spring (we use children's sand box). 

Parsnips — Leave in ground; frost 
improves flavor. 

Cabbage — Place in cool part of 
basement, stems up. 

Pumpkins, Hubbard Squash — Store 
in dry, medium warm place in base- 
ment. 

Onions — Dark, dry, cool place in 
basement; will keep all year if sorted 
in spring. 

Potatoes — Dry, cool, dark bin in 
basement. — Mrs. John Oatfield, Mil- 
waukie, Or. 

Serving Green "Vegetables. 

Washing must be very thorough; a 
little salt or bicarbonate of soda helps 
to bring small insects to surface of 
water. 

Their real benefit lies in being al- 
ways on our menu and not served 
with too much dressing or seasoning.

Combination Vegetable Salads 



Here are some salads, most of 
which you will see are very inexpen- 
sive — particularly as most of the in- 
gredients we have from our war gar- 
dens at home, so they do not cost us 
any money to buy them. These are 
also the most wholesome kind of sal- 
ads, giving the crisp green vegetable 
"naturally" with wholesome dress- 
ings. The price estimates are for the 
purpose of comparison of the cost of 
one recipe with another.

Lettuce should be washed, dried and 
placed in a cool place for at least two 
hours before serving. The vegetables 
may be those left from a previous 
meal and the combinations are end- 
less. My rule is to use what I have 
on hand and arrange as artistically 
as may be on the lettuce leaves, pour- 
ing over them the dressing just be- 
fore serving. As the vegetables are 
"leftovers," I have omitted cost of 
cooking them. — Mary G. Morrison, 752

This salad dressing is delicious and 
serves as a very useful way of using 
up a little cream which may have 
soured. The bowl should be rubbed 
with a piece of onion, then the ingre- 
dients added, in order named, thor- 
oughly mixing with egg beater. 

Lettuce must be washed and thor- 
oughly dried, kept in cool place to be- 
come crisp. Radishes are washed and 
sliced. Tomatoes peeled carefully 
without the use of hot water to con- 
serve their flavor. Arrange peas in a 
mound on lettuce leaves, arrange to- 
matoes, sliced, around peas and gar- 
nish the whole with sliced radishes. 
Pour on dressing just before serving.

the mound, hit-and-miss fashion and

Any other salad dressing will do 
as well, but I prefer Durkee's. 

(Mrs. Jones does not say how many 
her recipes serve, but the first one 
might serve five people at a cost of 10 
cents each, and the second one six peo- 
ple at nearly 9 cents each just for 
salad. While we are in the grip of 
this terrible war, with our national 
future looking as dark as it does 
just now, it seems to me we should 
put such high priced recipes aside, 
and cook as economically as we pos- 
sibly can, and yet keep our families 
in good health. Now, if ever, we 
should "eat to live" — not "live to 
eat." Think of those dear mothers' 
boys in the trenches and what even 
50 cents worth of some litle comfort 
would be to them!)

To make the dressing, rub flour 
smooth in a little cold water, over 
which pour one-half cup boiling water 
slowly and cook until thick and 
smooth, stirring constantly. Let cool. 
Beat egg thoroughly, add two table- 
spoonfuls melted butter, and two ta- 
blespoonfuls of lemon juice and one- 
quarter teaspoonful salt. Cook smooth 
in double boiler, stirring constantly. 
Cool and beat two mixtures together, 
adding sugar and a little paprika. 
When ready to pour over fruit add 
one-half pint whipping cream beaten 
stiff. To prepare fruit, shred pine- 
apple and dice oranges and place in 
colander that juice may drip off. Slice 
bananas and chop apples and walnut 
meats. Mix all together, reserving 
half of chopped nuts to use as gar- 
nish. Place lettuce leaves on salad 
plates and then put on fruit mixture 
blended well with the dressing. Use 
the other one-half pint whipped cream 
over top and sprinkle with walnut 
meats. A couple candied cherries and 
a little candied orange peel on each 
dish improves taste as well as looks. 
Save juice from oranges and pine- 
apple and by adding to cold tea with 
lemon juice and sugar you will have 
a delicious drink. — Mrs. L. R. Marvin,

her pricing, and thought her recipe 
cost only 6 cents instead of 10 cents 
per portion. This recipe, though de- 
licious, is far more expensive than 
Mrs. Jones' of yesterday, as Mrs. 
Jones' fish recipe had rather more

In mixing the dressing, I have 
found that if egg, seasoning and lem- 
on juice are first beaten together 
thoroughly, the oil may then be added 
very rapidly with no danger of spoil-

cold water; cook till it thickens, then 
let cool, add the yolk of one egg, any 
seasoning desired, lemon juice or 
vinegar, little sugar, salt, white pep- 
per. Whip with egg beater. You may 
add two or three tablespoonfuls of 
oil to thicken. This makes a deli- 
cious dressing for fruit salads, using 
the white of the egg instead of the 
yolk. This costs about, one-third less

(I think Mrs. Roberts is mistaken 
in calling this a "French Dressing." 
What we understand by that term is 
a mixture of oil and vinegar, salt and 
pepper, with a little other seasoning 
like onion juice if desired. This is 
mixed plain and the oil is never beat- 
en int6an emulsion with egg. When 
that is done, as in this recipe, the 
dressing is called a mayonnaise al- 
w ays. )

fuls of lemon juice (or vinegar if 
necessary), Vi teaspoon mustard, one 
tablespoon sugar and one teaspoon 
salt; stir all well together. Use on 
cabbage or potato salad, or use on 
fruit salad, leaving out the mustard. 
Keep cold after made as it will not 
keep long. Put paprika peppers on 
top to garnish. — Mrs. F. N. C, 790 
E. Ankeny st., city. 

Cheese With Salads. 

Cheese or cheese dishes are an ac- 
ceptable addition to salads. Neufcha- 
tel or other cream cheese, either plain 
or mixed with pimentos and olives, 
may be served with lettuce or may be 
cut into slices and served on lettuce. 
Cheese balls are often served with 
salad. They are made of some soft 
cream cheese and are frequently com- 
bined with chopped chives, olives, 
sweet peppers, chopped nuts, etc., for 
the sake of adding flavor. Spinach ex- 
tract, etc., is sometimes mixed in for 
the sake of color. If the balls are 
rolled in chopped chives or parsley, 
both flavor and color are supplied. 
Cottage or "Dutch" cheese may be 
used also, seasoned in various ways 
and rolled into little balls. It is very 
cheap and attractive. — I. G. C, 790 
East Ankeny street, city. 



Nuts. 

(Here is a good suggestion about 
nuts that was omitted from our pre- 
vious work, so I will insert it here, 
as we are using them in our salads.) 

When nuts have become too dry to 
be good, let them stand over night 
in equal parts of milk and water. 
Then dry slowly in a moderate 
oven. — Amy B. Westbrook, 1540 Salem 
road, Albany, Or. 

Greens for Garnishing. 

Have a box or large pan in any 
convenient window, basement or any 
other place. Have a rich garden soil 
in it and plant cress, chick weed and 
parsley. In this climate you can have 
parsley and garden mustard (curly) 
outdoors most of the winter. When 
frost touches the curly mustard it 
turns a beautiful red and yellow. 
Curly Scotch kale is very good for 
garnishing; when small is edible. — 
Mrs. Kittie Goodall Turner, Corval- 
lis, Or. 

(Kale "greens" are good all winter. 
Cook the tender inside leaves and 
they are as good as spinach. They 
may be parboiled and the water 
turned off at once, if the flavor is too 
strong, but my family like them with- 
out.)

Our Desserts 



This is the call we sent out to our 
housewives: 

Please study your recipes and see 
how they can be made to conform to 
Mr. Hoover's requests. You know 
that, and can study it for yourselves, 
just as well — (undoubtedly better) 
than I. How can we cut down on 
sugar in pudding's? By using honey? 
By using Karo (corn syrup)? No 
maple sugar or maple syrup can be 
made out here, and it is too expen- 
sive to ship it so far for ordinary 
cooking. What recipes have you for 
puddings using New Orleans mo- 
lasses, or any other substitute for 
sugar? Let us see what Western wo- 
men can do when they try. 

Then as to fats. What can we use 
instead of fats? How can we make 
pie crust without lard? How can we 
make puddings and pudding sauces 
without butter? By using fruit juices 
for sauces? If so, won't it take too 
much sugar to sweeten the fruit 
juice? We can use sweet oranges and 
eggs. Even if eggs are "high," our 
basis just now is conservation of 
sugar and fat, instead of economy. If 
our country asks us to do certain 
things we must do them, even if they 
do cost us more. (Cost! What is this 
war costing us now in men and 
money? The little extra cost of our 
food is a very small thing we are 
asked for). Then after conservation 
must come economy. Let us have all 
our recipes just as economical as is 
consistent with saving the fats and 
sugars for our soldiers and our allies. 

Our response in the following re- 
cipes is from women who are honest- 
ly trying to meet Mr. Hoover's re- 
quests; but this is all new work to all 
women, and we can't adjust our 
standards and change our recipes on 
short notice. Never before were we 
asked to cook without using lard or 
butter or sugar. Our recipe books 
don't help us here at all. The only 
thing we can do is to "cut and try" 
and be unselfish and patriotic enough 
to give the widest publicity to any 
new combination along these lines we 
can work out. A few women do not 
seem yet to know that our nation is 
at war; that our standards of cooking 
have changed; that Mr. Hoover has 
told us what we can use, and that 
these are requirements that we must 
follow, just as the conscripted sol- 
dier obeys orders. These are our or- 
ders. Can't we all obey them will- 
ingly? Can't we all do this little thing 
— sacrifice our pride in our delicious 
cooking and our own appetite for 
delicacies? "What is all of that — what 
is any kind of food, so that we can 
live and work upon what we get — 
when we think of our own American 



boys in those awful drives they are 
now making on the front lines? Do 
let's wake up. Do let's be in deadly 
earnest to do all we can (it is so lit- 
tle, nothing, almost, in comparison). 
Let us say: If meat (and sugar and 
fats) maketh those who are fighting 
for us strong, I will eat no meat (or 
sugar or fats) while the war lasts! 

PASTRY. 

We have not very many pie recipes. 
I wonder why. I thought we all 
made more pies than puddings, usu- 
ally. You know pie is called "the 
great American dish" abroad, but we 
don't seem to be living up to our 
reputation, somehow. Is it that it is 
harder to make conservation pie than 
pudding? It doesn't seem as though 
it would be in the filling, anyway, as 
we can make all kinds of fruit pies 
from our abundance of canned fruit 
that we get so freely and cheaply out 
here. Then there is my green tomato 
mincemeat, but I really must not 
mention that again, or you will rebel. 
If we use Cottolene, Kaola, Crisco, 
etc., in place of lard in our crusts we 
will be able to make good conserva- 
tion pies. 

Making: Pie Crust. 

Before putting a filling into your 
pie, brush over the bottom of your 
pie with a little of the beaten white 
of an egg; then sift over a little flour 
or corn starch. This will prevent the 
bottoms from becoming soaked if pies 
stand a while before being used.- — 
Mrs. Williams. 

To Prevent Juice From Running Out. 

A two-inch length of macaroni 
set through the upper crust makes a 
good tube. The juice will bubble up 
in this instead of running out. 

Mixing the white flour with one- 
third to one-half its bulk with corn 
meal will make a lighter and more 
digestible crust. 

Never use any wetting in your fruit 
pies. — Mrs. W. W. Williams, 1411 Rod- 
ney avenue, city. 

The surest way I know for an in- 
experienced cook, and the quickest 
for an experienced one, to keep a fruit 
pie from running over, is to have a 
piece of old white cloth, torn a cou- 
ple of inches longer than the dis- 
tance around your pie tin; and then 
every time you make a pie tear off 
a strip an inch or so wide, wet in cold 
water and bind around the pie just 
before putting in the oven. You can 
fasten it with a pin or a little flour 
at the ends, and your pie is certain 
not to run over.

Recipes Required. 

Desserts, pastry, pudding's, ices, etc., 
endeavoring to conform all recipes to 
Mr. Hoover's requirements as nearly 
as possible. 

A puzzle for all Portland house- 
wives to solve for themselves and all 
other women, is to save the fats, save 
the sugar, and yet give us recipes for 
good desserts. 

First Prize. 

For the best pie made as above, con- 
serving as the food administration 
suggests, without regard to economy. 

This prize was won by Mrs. Spen- 
cer, with the following pie (of which 

1 ate a large part myself and found it 
as delicious a pie as I ever tasted): 

Blackberry Pie (Large). 

Cost.

2 T flour ...... 0018 

1 T milk 0017 

Gas, 20 minutes 0085 

Cost $0.1544 

The pie crust is made the same as 
for apple pie. When the pie plate is 
lined, put the flour in; then the 
blackberries. Roll out crust for the 
top. Make leaves on the top by prick- 
ing with a fork, moisten edges of the 
lower crust with cold water, put on 
the top crust, press together, brush 
over with milk and bake in a moder- 
ate oven 20 minutes. — Mrs. G. Spencer, 
1260 East Davis street, city. 

Here is the crust recipe from Mrs. 
Spencer's apple pie, which was ex- 
cellent: 

Pie Crust. 

Sift the flour and salt together, rub 
the shortening in with tips of fingers 
till it is fine like crumbs; now take 
out one-third of the mixture, mix the 
remaining part with the water (with 
a silver knife) ; turn out on a floured 
board, roll about one-quarter of an 
inch thick, sprinkle with some of the 
dry mixture, roll again, continue this 
process till all is used up; be sure to 
handle lightly; pare and core the ap- 
ples; cut in thin slices, fill the lined 
pie plate, sprinkling the sugar and 
spices between, moisten the edges 
with cold water, put on the top crust 
and press together with a fork, brush 
over with milk and bake in a moder- 
ate oven. — Mrs. George Spencer, 1260 
East Davis street, city. 



Green Currant Pie. 

Gather currants when fully grown 
or just before they turn red; mix 1% 
T of flour with 1 c sugar and 2 c 
currants for one large pie. Bake 
with upper crust. 

Green Gooseberry Pie. 

1% c gooseberries, 1 c sugar, 1% t 
flour. Bake with upper crust. — Mrs. 
W. W. Williams, 1411 Rodney ave., 
city. 

Crustless Pie Recipes. 

Mrs. Moran says: Inclosed you will 
find some crustless pie recipes, which 

1 am sure will be appreciated by 
those who are trying to conserve. 
No. 1. Fill a granite or aluminum 
pie pan with finely sliced apples of 
nice cooking variety. Make batter as 
for pancakes except stiffer and 
use 1 tablespoonful of shortening. 
Spread over apples, bake in moderate 
oven till apples are tender. The pan 
should be well greased before putting 
apples in. When done turn pie up- 
side down on plate; this can be done 
by placing plate upside down on pie, 
then turn over. Sprinkle sugar and 
dust cinnamon with a few bits of 
butter over. This is splendid eaten 
while warm and is good cold. 

Apple Pie. 

Line pie pan with a good crust 
made as other crusts, adding a tea- 
spoonful of baking powder. Use ap- 
ples that cook readily, quarter and 
place in order in the pie — that is, 
place the quarters around and around 
until the pie is filled, having one 
layer. Blend one-half cupful of sugar 
with 2 tablespoonfuls flour. Dis- 
solve with cold water, then fill cup 
with hot water. Pour over apples; 
place bits of butter and a dash of 
nutmeg over pie and bake moderate- 
ly. There should be enough of the 
dressing to come well over the ap- 
ples. — Mrs. C. Moran, Jennings Lodge, 
Or.

erate oven. — Mrs. George Spencer, 
1620 East Davis Street, City. 

Dried Apple Pie. 

Dried apples should be soaked over 
night, then stewed in just enough 
water to cover them for two or three 
hours. When soft, put through a 
coarse colander; season to taste with 
sugar and cinnamon, and bake open 
face or cross bars. 

For one pie, take: 

2 c apple sauce. 

Vz c sugar. 

1 t cinnamon.

as dried apples. 

Make a most delicious pie. 

Bake with one crust or cross bars.

— Mrs. H. H. Barnes, Ridgefield, Wash. 
(There were many variations on this 
same pudding in the unpublished 
recipes, and I saw one much the same 
on the blackboard of the domestic 
science room in the Woodlawn school 
on Thanksgiving day, but our judge 
thought this one from Washington 
the best and most original of the 
many.) 



This recipe of Mrs. Barnes' is one 
of the very few I have received that 
goes to the press absolutely without 
correction of any kind, and the con- 
servation puzzle is surely solved in 
this splendid conservation recipe. I 
only wish she had told us how many 
it would serve.

mix until each particle of fruit is well 
floured. Then add the nuts that have 
been blanched and chopped fine. Add 
the nutmeg, bread crumbs and chopped 
suet. Beat the eggs without separat- 
ing until light. Add the grape juice, 
pour this over the dry ingredients 



and mix thoroughly. The pudding 
must be moist, not wet. Pack the 
mixture in greased molds, cover and 
boil or steam 10 hours. When done, 
remove the lids and allow the pudding 
to cool. When cold, put on the lids, 
wipe off the molds, and put them 
away. When wanted for use, re-heat 
by boiling or steaming one hour. This 
will keep for months, in fact it Is 
better and more digestible when old 
than when fresh. Serve with hard

lish walnuts the same, V 2 cup; raisins 
V 2 cup. Put together the same as 
bread pudding-. Serve with any kind 
of dressing. This is great; nothing 
better. — Mrs. A. E. Coombs, 560 Glisan 
street. 

Directions for making Bread Pud- 
ding: 

Cover the bread (pancakes) with 
the milk and let soak 20 min. Then 
add the molasses, the rest of the milk, 
the cinnamon and at last the well 
beaten eggs. Turn into well greased 
baking dish, bake in a moderate oven 
until "set." Serve with milk or lem- 
on sauce or use warm without sauce. 

Of course there are other recipes 
for bread pudding, under different 
combinations. It seems to me that 
here we have an ideal conservation 
recipe for the following reasons: 

1st. — We use up cold pancakes — 
left overs — (the conservation of 
waste.) 

2d. — Our pancakes are always made 
of at least part substitute for wheat 
flour, buckwheat, corn meal, etc. — 
(the conservation of wheat.) 

3d. — We use N. O. molasses instead 
of sugar — (the conservation of sugar.) 

4th. — We use our home-grown wal- 
nuts instead of fat of any kind, even 
for greasing the pan we use Wesson 
oil or any other vegetable fat — (the 
conservation of fat.) 

5th. — We use Oregon home-grown 
walnuts and California oranges — 
(products of our section of the coun- 
try.) 

6th. — We need no sauce at all to eat 
with it — (so again we conserve the 
fats and sugar.) 

7th. — It is wholesome and nutri- 
tious, all the elements entering into 
it having good food value.) 

8th. — It is very economical, costing 
2% cents per cupful or about 1 cent 
per half cupful, which might be the 
portion served. 

9th. — It is guaranteed to be "deli- 
cious" by two of our good kitchen 
cooks. 

(We might also have said it was 
hearty enough to take the place of 
meat.) 



Now take some recipe of your own 
or one from any place — and analyze 
it out this way and see if you can 
beat this one. This is just as inter- 
esting as any game (or fancy work). 
Just try it. 

Quick Puff Pudding. 

Here is a great favorite of mine. 
It is so easily made, that one can get 
it ready any time at the last moment 
(when unexpected company appears 
on wash day, etc.) and it is always 
light, and good, besides being very 
wholesome, and using any of our 
home preserved fruits.

Canned or preserved fruit OODO 

Gas 20 minutes 0038 

Cost without fruit $0.0652 

Stir one pint of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and a little salt 
into milk until very soft; place in 
the steamer's well greased cups, put 
in each a spoonful of batter, then one 
of fruit or preserves, cover with an- 
other spoonful of batter (the cup 
should not be over % full in all) and 
steam 20 minutes. (I use top milk and 
sugar with it.) "This pudding is de- 
licious made with fresh strawberries, 
and eaten with a sauce made of two 
eggs, one-half cup of butter and a 
cup of sugar, beaten thoroughly with 
a cupful of boiling milk and one of 
strawberries. — Mrs. B. T. Skinner, 
Battle Creek, Mich." 

This quick puff pudding uses 
little white flour, and would have to 
have that or whole wheat, but there 
is no sugar or fat in the recipe at 
all, and it is the best conserver of 
time I know of, and also enables us 
to use up all the little "dabs" of 
fruit, jelly, preserves, etc., we happen 
to have left, as the filling in each 
cup may be different, and it is al- 
ways light and good, no matter how 
inexperienced a person makes it, if 
it is cooked till done. I found that it 
required nearer half an hour than 20 
minutes to cook thoroughly. 



Some Other Desserts 



Conservation Desserts. 

Here are some suggestions for con- 
serving sugar and fats by using fruits 
for desserts: 

La Composite. 

Peel bananas and slice thin. Peel 
oranges and slice an equal quantity 
thin. Place in layers with strained 
honey or syrup between. Let set 
awhile before using. 



Ambrosia. 

Equal parts of peeled and sliced 
oranges and peeled and sliced pine- 
apple treated as above and sprinkling 
each layer also with grated cocoanut. 

Pineapple. 

Fully ripe pineapple, pared, sliced 
or cut in small pieces require no 
seasoning, even sugar, but honey or 
a little sugar may be added if de- 
sired.

Raisins and Cranberries. 

Two quarts cranberries, one pint 
raisins, two pounds sugar, one quart 
water. Cook in a stone crock until 
the berries are well broken; don't 
allow them to burn. Then pour out 
to cool. 

(Try this, using- two quarts corn 
syrup instead of the two pounds of 
sugar and one quart of water. I be- 
lieve it would make a fine sauce or 
pie, and if we can use raisins for 
sweetening- that will help out on the 
sugar.) 

Apples With Raisins. 

Take a dozen tart apples, pare, core 
an<j quarter, thoroughly clean one- 
quarter as many raisins as apples. 
Pour over the raisins one quart of 
boiling water and let stew until they 
are well swollen, then add the apples 
and cook until tender. No sugar will 
be needed. 

Baked Apples. 

Select nice tart apples, wipe clean 
and bake in a moderate oven until 
done; bake slowly. When desiring to 
serve with milk or cream, use sweet 
apples. 

Baked Sweet Apples. 

Select nice sweet apples, wipe them 
well, fill a dish nearly to the top with 
the apples, first quartering and cor- 
ing them, but do not pare them. Set 
the vessel into a kettle of water or a 
steamer, and steam until ner.rly soft; 
then place the vessel containing the 
apples in the oven, covering it with 
a plate. Let them bake until the 
juice is nearly absorbed; take out and 
serve with milk or whipped cream. 

Dried Apples. 

Soak over night dried apples and 
stew with raisins. This makes a pal- 
atable dish or pie. 

Cranberries and Sweet Apples. 

Stew together equal parts of cran- 
berries and sweet apples, wash, rub 
through a colander to remove the 
skins; a little sugar may be used to 
sweeten, but it makes a very palat- 
able sauce without it. 

Baked Bananas. 

Select large red bananas, take the 
skin off from one section of the 
bananas, and loosen the skin from 
them; put a row in a dripping pan, 
with the side up from which you took 



the peeling; sprinkle on a very little 
sugar, and bake one-half hour in a 
quick oven. 

Stewed Raisins. 

Wash, then soak several hours in 
cold water a pint of good raisins, cook 
them in the same water in which 
they were soaked. Do not let them 
boil, but place them on the back of 
the stove and let them simmer until 
the skins are tender. Three or four 
figs, chopped fine, cooked with the 
raisins gives a richness to the juice.

Making Conservation Cakes. 

One friend asks if sugar and butter 
are absolutely prohibited for cakes and 
says she can't make as good cakes 
without sugar. It seems to me that 
we should not use butter at all for 
cooking, in any way, and that we 
don't need to. For a number of years 
I have been using these vegetable 
fats as substitutes in all my cooking, 
even cakes, and found that as de- 
licious cakes as any one needs to have 
can be made with Crisco, Cottolene, 
Kaola, etc. As to sugar, the case is 
different. We have no substitute that 
answers perfectly except in fruit 
cakes, which are rather heavy and in- 
digestible for children. So we will 
print recipes containing sugar, but 
use as little as you can. As has been 
said before we expect our recipes to 
be used long after this war is over, 
when we will have a perfect right 
to use sugar, which is as economical 
as any sweetening. 

AUNT PRUDENCE. 



Conservation Candies 



A Christmas Gilt Suggestion. 

What prettier or nicer Christmas 
gift could there be than a dainty box 
of home-made candy? It would be 
very nice to get a pretty box, deco- 
rated with holly leaves and berries, 
and fill it with an assortment of 
candy. Place each kind in a layer by 
itself, with a piece of white card- 
board or waxed paper between the 
layers and a piece of tissue paper or 
waxed paper on top. Place the cover 
on and tie with narrow holly ribbon, 
with a tiny sprig of holly caught in 
the bow. — Mrs. Grace Howard, 750 
Kelly street. 

Coloring for Candies. 

When making candy coloring mat- 
ter is desired to lend a pleasing vari- 
ety. Perfectly harmless yellow, green 
and pink may be used. Saffron will 



give the yellow tint; spinach and beet 
leaves crushed and boiled in a little 
water will give green and the juice 
of strawberries, raspberries and 
blackberries will give varying shades 
of pink in summer, while that of 
cranberries may be used in winter. — 
Mrs. Grace Howard, 750 Kelly street. 

Chocolate Dainties. 

Mix thoroughly y 2 cup of pecan 
nuts, y 2 cup of walnuts, 2-3 cup figs 
cut in pieces, and 1-3 cup stoned 
dates. Chop or grind all together. 
Add 1 tablespoonful of orange juice, 
a small bit of grated orange peel and 
1 square of melted unsweetened choc- 
olate. 

Toss on a board sprinkled with 
grated nuts or cocoanut, and roll or 
cut in any shape desired. Wrap each 
piece in waxed paper. — Mrs. Grace 
Howard, 750 Kelly street.

Generally Considered 



Conservation Entertaining. 

Here is a very important matter 
lately called to my attention; that is, 
people entertaining- now for the Red 
Cross or any charitable or philan- 
thropic cause, and serving 1 refresh- 
ments — sandwiches and coffee or tea. 
Mr. Hoover has definitely spoken of 
this very thing, and asked lis not to 
do it, and it should not be done in the 
name of the Red Cross or anything 
else. People should not serve these 
refreshemnts now, either, for the 
same reason, to their little evening 
companies at home. Of course, our 
recipes are written and printer! only 
once, and we hope will be used long 
after this war is over, nut we must 
nor forget that Mr. Hoover has given 
us our orders — No entertaining out of 
meal hours during the war -and it is 
our duty to live up to this. We are 
disloyal if we do not. 

If we absolutely feel that we must 
serve something to a little evening 
company, why not serve fruit — 
grapes, apples, bananas or old-fash- 
ioned popcorn for the young people. 
It won't hurt us. It is better for us — 
and we have had our orders from 
headquarters. 

To Make Sandwiches. 

Sandwiches may be made from one 
of three or four kinds of bread: 
Whole wheat bread, Boston brown or 
oatmeal bread, white .bread and rye 
bread made into square, deep loaves; 
in fact, all bread used for sandwiches 
should be made especially for the pur- 
pose, so that the slices may be in 
good form and sufficiently large to 
cut into fancy shapes. 

The butter may be used plain, 
slightly softened, or it may be sea- 
soned and flavored with just a suspi- 
cion of paprika, a little white pepper 



and a few drops of Worcestershire 
sauce. 

Meat used for sandwiches should be 
chopped very fine and slightly mois- 
tened with cream, melted butter, olive 
oil or mayonnaise dressing well sea- 
soned. Fish should be rubbed or 
pounded in a mortar, add enough 
sauce tartare to make it sufficiently 
moist to easily spread. 

Turkey, chicken, game, tongue, beef 
and mutton, with their proper sea- 
sonings, moistened with either may- 
onnaise or French dressing, make ex- 
ceedingly nice sandwiches. 

To Keep Sandwiches. 

It is frequently necessary to make 
sandwiches several hours before they 
are needed. As they dry quickly they 
must be carefully wrapped or they 
will be unpalatable. Wring from cold 
water two ordinary tea towels; put 
one on top of the other. An old ta- 
blecloth will answer the purpose very 
well. As fast as the sandwiches are 
made put them on top of the damp 
towel; when you have the desired 
quantity cover the top with moist let- 
tuce leaves; fold over the towels and 
put outside of this a perfectly dry, 
square cloth. Sandwiches will keep 
in this way for several hours and in 
perfectly good condition. On a very 
warm day they may be covered all 
over with moist lettuce leaves; use 
the green ones that aro not palatable 
or sightly for garnishing. 

This is for parties, picnics, etc., of 
course. We all know that the fine 
sheets of oiled paper we buy so cheap- 
ly for the purpose are just the thing 
to keep individual sandwiches fresh 
until used. I always save the paraffin 
paper from bread also, as that is bet- 
ter than anything else for the pur- 
pose. 



Sandwich Fillings, Etc. 



Reception Sandwiches. 

One cup cold boiled beef tongue, % 
cupful Brazil nut meats or English 
walnuts; run through a meat grinder, 
mix with 1 tablespoonful Worcester- 
shire sauce, a very little mayonnaise 
and put between round or triangular 
slices of bread. — I. G. C. 

Chicken for Sandwiches. 

One 3-lb. chicken cut up or un- 
jointed; 1 root of celery, 1 teaspoonful 
salt, y 8 teaspoonful pepper. Cover 
with hot water and boil until it can 
be taken from bone; remove meat 
from bone, cut in small pieces and 



pack in dish, add 1 teaspoonful gela- 
tine, dissolved in 2 tablespoonfuls wa- 
ter to stock and pour over chicken; 
when cold cut in thin slices. — Mrs. W. 
W. Williams, 1411 Rodney avenue. 

Cheese and Walnut Sandwiches. 

One-half pound of cheese, % pound 
English walnut meats, % teaspoonful 
salt and a dash of red pepper; run 
through a meat grinder, mix with a 
little mayonnaise dressing until soft 
enough to spread, put between thinly 
sliced bread, cut about 1% inches 
wide; serve with salad for a luncheon. 
—I. G. C.

Mrs. Rorer's Recipes. 

Here are some sandwich filling's 
from Mrs. Rorer's "Light Entertain- 
ing": 

Salad Sandwiches. 

Under the head of salad sandwiches 
all forms of meat may be placed on 
lettuce leaves, put between the slices 
of bread and tied together with rib- 
bon, or held by means of a toothpick, 
or the slices may be pressed together 
and the crusts trimmed. Romaine, 
sorrel, endive and escarole may be 
substituted for lettuce in making 
these salad sandwiches. 

Dill and Celery. 

Cover thinly sliced white or rye 
bread with a mixture made of chopped 
dill pickles and celery. Moisten with 
salad dressing. 

Olive and Pimento Sandwiches. 

Take equal quantities of ripe olives, 
stoned, and canned pimentos (sweet 
red peppers). Chop very fine. 

Olive. 

Take equal parts of plain and 
stuffed olives. Put through a meat 
grinder, mix with mayonnaise and 
spread. 

Onion. 

Select very mild onions. Slice very 
thin and lay in ice water for a half 
hour before using. Season with pepper 
and salt. These are delicious as a 
filling for Boston brown bread sand- 
wiches. 

Cncumber and Onion. 

Take equal parts of chopped cucum- 
bers and mild raw onions. Moisten 
with salad dressing and spread on rye 
or graham bread. 

Spinach. 

Chop cold boiled spinach very fine. 
Mix with mayonnaise dressing and 
chopped yolks of hard boiled eggs. 

Harlequin. 

Cream butter and into it mix 
chopped parsley, capers and green 
peppers. Use enough of the vegeta- 
bles to make the butter a decided 
green. Flavor with pepper, salt and 
a little cayenne. By cutting the bread 
very thin and insetting a slice Of 
brown bread between two of white an 
effective and appetizing sandwich is 
made. 

Chili. 

Mix chili sauce with finely chopped 
celery. With the scissors cut lettuce 
or romaine into narrow ribbons, lay 
on the bread and spread with the mix- 
ture. 



Green Pepper. 

Prepare a sufficient number of 
sweet green peppers by removing 
carefully every seed and the white 
fiber. Put through a meat grinder. 
Mix with mayonnaise and a little 
minced celery. This mixture may be 
spread direct on the buttered bread, 
or a small lettuce leaf may be laid on 
first. 

Water Cress. 

Thoroughly wash the cress and dry 
it in a cloth; cut it into small pieces 
and mix with finely chopped hard 
boiled eggs seasoned with salt and 
pepper. Spread between thin, but- 
tered slices of bread, sprinkling the 
cress and eggs very lightly with 
lemon juice. 

Cheese Neapolitan. 

This is a very pretty sandwich when 
finished, showing an inner slice of 
brown bread between two of white. 
Butter the white bread with creamed 
butter mixed with a little mustard or 
horseradish. On one of these slices 
lay a thin slice of brown bread which 
has been spread with cream or cot- 
tage cheese. The other side of the 
brown bread may have the same 
cheese or if variety is desired try 
anchovy or sardine paste or any of 
the potted meats. Cover with the 
second slice of white bread. 

American Cheese. 

Slice the cheese so thin that it is a 
mere shaving. Sprinkle on a little 
paprika and salt. Mustard may be 
added if liked. 

Grated Cheese. 

Mix equal quantities of grated 
cheese and reduce to a paste with 
creamed butter. Cut entire wheat 
bread in finger strips and spread with 
this paste. This sandwich is deli- 
cious seasoned with anchovy essence, 
paprika and mustard. 

Cheese and Nut. 

Mix equal quantities of grated 
cheese and chopped English walnut 
meats. Season with a few drops of 
lemon juice, paprika and salt. 

Cheese and Horseradish. 

Spread thinly cut white bread with 
cream cheese into which has been 
stirred sufficient fresh cream to make 
a paste. Spread the bread first with 
butter, then with a thin layer of 
horseradish and then add the cheese 
filling. 

Cheese and Lettuce. 

Dip a small white leaf of lettuce 
into French dressing. Lay between

bread which have been previously 
spread with cream cheese made into 
a paste cream. 

Nut and Sweet Sandwiches. 

Thin slices of bread are delicious 
spread with any jam, marmalade or 
chopped preserved or candied fruit. 
Chopped nuts, either salted or plain, 
may also be used for sandwiches. 
The combination of nuts and fruit is 
particularly good. 

Peanut Butter. 

To one-half box of peanut butter 
allow a dozen olives chopped very 
fine. Season with lemon juice, salt 
and a few drops of Worcestershire 
sauce if liked. This is good on any 
kind of bread. 

Celery Salad. 

Put four eggs into warm water; 
bring to the boiling point, and keep 
there, without boiling, for 15 min- 
utes. Take the white portion from 
one head of celery; wasti and chop it 
very fine. Remove the shells from 
the hard-boiled eggs, and either chop 
them very fine or put through a vege- 
table press and mix with them the 
celery; add a half teaspoonful of salt 
and a dash of pepper. Butter the 
bread before you cut it from the loaf. 
After you have a sufficient quantity 
cut, put over each slice a layer of 
the mixed egg and celery; put right in 
the center of this a teaspoonful of 
mayonnaise dressing, and sort of 
smooth it all over. Put two pieces 
together and press them lightly. 

Cooked Cheese. 

Chop fine l A pound of soft Ameri- 
can cheese; put it into a saucepan; 
add the yolk of one egg beaten with 
two tablespoonfuls of cream, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper 
and half a teaspoonful of "Worcester- 
shire sauce. Have ready cut and but- 
tered a sufficient number of slices of 
bread, either white or whole wheat. 
Stir the cheese over the fire until it is 
thoroughly melted; take from the fire 
and when cool spread it between the 
slices of bread and butter; that is, 
spread it on one slice and cover with 
the other and press two together. 

Workman's Cheese. 
Cut slices of brown bread about a 
half inch thick. Do not remove the 
crusts. Take a half pint of cottage 
cheese, press it through a sieve, add 
to it 2 tablespoonfuls of thick cream. 
Beat until smooth and light. Spread 
each slice of bread thickly with the 
cheese mixture, then put a very thin 
slice of wheat bread on top of the 
cheese, then cheese and brown bread; 



press together. Have the outside 
brown bread with a layer of cheese on 
each, and between the layers of 
cheese a slice of white broad. These 
are palatable, and they are very much 
better for the average workman than 
bread and ham. 

Honolulu, 

Put two Spanish sweet peppers (pi- 
mentos), 1 Neufchatel cheese, 1 pared 
and quartered apple and 12 blanched 
almonds through the meat grinder. 
These may be put through alternate- 
ly, or mixed as you grind. Rub the 
mixture, add V 2 teaspoonful salt and a 
saltspoonful of paprika. Spread this 
between thin slices of buttered white 
and brown bread. Press; cut the 
crusts and cut into finger-shaped 
pieces. 

Favorite. 

Half pound of American cheese, % 
cupful thick sour cream, 1 teaspoon- 
ful of "Worcestershire sauce, 1 table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, y 2 tea- 
spoonful salt, V 2 teaspoonful of pap- 
rika. Chop or mash the cheese, add 
gradually the cream, and when 
smooth add all the other ingredients. 
Spread this mixture on thin slices of 
buttered bread; cover the top with 
chopped cress; then cover with an- 
other slice of bread and press the two 
together. 

Creole. 

Put a half pound of American 
cheese through a meat grinder; add to 
it one Neufchatel cheese, mix well to- 
gether; add 1 fresh poeled chopped 
tomato. Peel the tomato and cut it 
into halves; squeeze out the seeds and 
chop the flesh quite firm. Add one 
finely chopped sweet red pepper. Add 
V 2 teaspoonful of salt and a little 
black pepper; mix and spread between 
slices of white bread, or you may use 
one slice of white with one slice of 
whole wheat bread. 

Cottage Cheese. 

These are splendid for country pic- 
nics. The cottage cheese should be 
made rather dry. After it has drained 
and is quite dry, moisten it by adding 
either thick cream or melted butter. 
Do not make it too soft. Add a salt- 
spoonful of black pepper and a pala- 
table seasoning of salt. Spread be- 
tween slices of buttered whole wheat; 
press the two together. 

Raisin Sandwiches. 

Put half pound of seeded raisins 
through the meat grinder; add quar- 
ter pound blanched and ground nuts, 
also a half tumbler of quince jelly. 
Mix thoroughly and put between thin 
slices of buttered bread.

Dates and Nuts for Teas. 

Stone a quarter of a pound of dates 
and put through meat grinder; add to 
them a half tumbler of nut butter; 
mix until smooth; add four table- 
spoonfuls sweet cream and one table- 
spoonful of orange juice. Put this 
between thin slices of white buttered 
bread and serve. 

Nut and Apple Filling. 

Put half cupful thick stewed apples 
into a bowl; add grated yellow rind of 
quarter of an orange, and one cupful 
of finely chopped mixed nuts. Spread 
this on Saltines, Uneedas, or any crisp 
crackers. Put another cracker on top 
and serve at once. These are espe- 
cially nice for children's parties. 

Fresh Fruit Sandwiches. 

These sandwiches are exceedingly 
nice to serve for afternoon teas. They 
must be used soon after they are 
made, but they will keep for an hour 
if wrapped in a damp cloth. 

Butter the bread and put between 
it layers of sliced strawberries, dust- 
ed with powdered sugar, or raspber- 
ries, or large blackberries cut in 
halves, or peaches finely chopped, or 
apple seasoned with a little salt, pep- 
per, olive oil and lemon juice; or sliced 
bananas with a little lemon juice — 
all are good. Of course, we have not 
any of these fruits now but the last, 
but we can remember this next sum- 
mer, to serve on a hot day with lem- 
onade or loganberry juice. 

Walnut and Celery. 

Take equal quantities of chopped 
English walnut meats and hearts of 
celery. These must be chopped so fine 
as to be almost like a paste. Moisten 
with mayonnaise dressing and spread 
on thin slices from a round loaf of 
Boston brown bread. 

Pecan and Date. 

Remove the pits from dates and also 
the fibrous white lining. Chop fine 
with an equal quantity of pecans or 
English walnuts. Use cream to form 
a paste and spread on thin bread as 
usual. 

SOME HOME RECIPES FOR SAND- 
WICH FILLINGS, ETC. 

Honey Sandwiches. 

Rub a little cream or cottage cheese 
smooth with cream; sweeten with 
strained honey and spread on thin 
slices of war bread. 

Nut and Raisin Sandwiches. 

Take equal quantities of nuts and 
seeded raisins; moisten with cream, 
grape juice or mayonnaise. SpreaJi 
on thin slices of whole wheat bread. 



Olive Sandwiches. 

Thin slices of rye bread; Neufcha- 
tel cheese mixed to a paste with 
cream, and salad dressing; cover 
thickly with chopped olives. 

Salmon Sandwiches. 

Whole wheat bread; salmon dressed 
with lemon juice, and salt and pep- 
per to taste on a lettuce leaf. 

Fig Sandwich. 

Rye bread with fig filling. Half 
pound finely chopped figs; quarter 
cupful honey; two tablespoonfuls 
lemon juice; two tablespoonfuls boil- 
ing water. Mix and cook in double 
boiler until thick enough to spread. 
The cost of these sandwiches would 
depend on where you bought your in- 
gredients and whether or not you 
baked your own bread. With a piece 
of war cake or some fruit would 
make a luncheon for any one ex- 
cept perhaps an outdoor worker 
Watching the miners going to work 
in a Butte mine, you would think 
they expected to be gone a week by 
the amount of food in their "nose- 
bags," as they call them. They al- 
ways seemed to have huge sand- 
wiches, pie and doughnuts. — Mrs. M. 
Gay, 709 East Twenty-ninth street 
North. 

Sandwich Filling. 

To a pint of left over meat that is 
real tender and run through a grinder 
add one cup of chopped peanuts; heat 
and mix together while hot; season 
with pepper and salt to taste. It has 
a splendid flavor and makes delicious 
sandwiches. 

Ribbon Sandwiches. 

Spread thin slices of brown bread 
with a very little butter and one slice 
with finely minced ham; then place 
over this a slice of American cheese 
sprinkled with paprika, pepper and 
salt; then add a slice of white bread; 
cut diagonally, making triangular 
sandwiches, three tiers deep. These 
are nice for light refreshments. 

Jelly Sandwiches. 

Spread graham bread with jelly and 
sprinkle jelly with chopped nuts; 
cover with white bread or brown 
bread and shape as above. 

Oriental Sandwiches. 

These are delicious and should be 
served with tea. Cut the bread very 
thin, spread one side with cream 
cheese and chopped dates and the 
other side with chopped peanuts and 
press together. — Mrs. Roberts.

Lunches for School Children 



Here is an appetizing and very sub- 
stantial dish for school children to be 
served at school: 

Baked Bean Chowder. 

Two cups of brown or white beans, 
three tablespoonfuls of drippings, 
dash of red pepper, three boiled pota- 
toes diced; one onion minced, one pint 
of tomatoes, one cup of boiling water, 
V4, teaspoonful salt; cook all together 
about 15 minutes; serve hot with 
wafers or slices of steamed brown 
bread. 

PENNY LUNCHES FOR SCHOOL 
CHILDREN. 

Here is some general information 
about sandwiches from a little book 
which I just found in the library yes- 
terday, called "A Penny Lunch," writ- 
ten to show how good nourishing food 
can be provided for school children 
for one penny per portion, which they 
figure at two-thirds of a cupful. It 
is really surprising — or would be to 



those who hadn't been figuring closely 
on stews, baked beans, macaroni 
dishes, etc., as we have — to see what 
good palatable, highly nourishing 
food can be furnished for children's 
lunches for 1 cent for two-thirds of a 
cupful. I wish I could print the whole 
tiny book, and that it would stir up 
a movement to provide every single 
school building in our city with a 
lunchroom, where two or three cents 
would provide the poorest child with 
all the nourishing food he could eat 
every noon. I can't think of a better 
work than that for any one to do 
now, especially when the carrying 
forward of our civilization depends 
so much on this new generation now 
being "trained for action" in our 
schools. 

Here is what the book says about 
sandwiches. Of course, you will un- 
derstand that these prices will not be 
exact for us, as this work was done 
in Louisville, Ky., in 1915; yet the 
variations in the prices since do hot

TELEGRAM CONSERVATION COOK BOOK. 



affect the price of small quantities 
so much but that we can form a 
very accurate estimate of what these 
food items will cost, and especially 
their comparative cost. 

Sandwiches. 

Each loaf of white bread was 11 by 
5 inches, weighed one pound, and cost 
4 cents. 

Each loaf of rye bread was 13 by 
4 inches, weighed one pound, and cost 
4 cents. 

Each loaf of graham bread was 10 
by 5 inches, weighed one pound, and 
cost 4 cents. 

"White loaf was cut to make 28 
slices; rye loaf to make 32 slices; 
graham loaf to make 26 slices. 

Buns and sweet rolls cost 60 cents 
a hundred. 

Preparation of Lettuce. 

Lettuce was thoroughly washed and 
dried; the leaves placed one upon an- 
other and shredded; then dressed with 
salt and mayonnaise, and used im- 
mediately. In this way two full 
bunches of lettuce made a good layer 
for 28 sandwiches. 

Peanut Butter. 

One pound of peanut butter, softened 
with one tablespoonful of salad oil, 
spread 38 sandwiches. 

Meat. 

Chuck was used for sandwiches. 
Two pounds, cooked, sliced or ground, 
seasoned with salt and mayonnaise, 
made 40 sandwiches.

WESTERN CONSERVATION 
COOKING. 

Here is a letter that is just ex- 
actly what we want, from just exactly 
the right source. Not theory, but the 
real experience of a loyal home-lover 
whose heart's deepest interests are 
with her home and her country. This 
is true Americanism that will 'pre- 
serve us a nation" forever. 

Mrs. Howard says: 

You have asked Portland house- 
wives to send in suggestions for 
lunches for school children, office 
workers, outdoor workers, parties, etc. 
We are asked to give nourishing, well 
balanced lunches and yet observe, as 
near as we can, Mr. Hoover's plea for 
conservation. It seems to me thai 
there are plenty of good nourishing- 
tilings we can use in place of sugar, 
bmier and tb-j expensive m^ats. 

Butter is 47 cents a pound, and we 
do not need it. We can substitute 
peanut butter, which is only 15 cents 
a pound, goes farther and is delicious 
It is especially good for children. I 
have three boys, two of them going to 
school, and my husband works out- 
doors at very hard work, in the ship- 
yards, and we use peanut butter in 
the lunches and on the table all the 
time. The children love it mixed 'with 
honey. Then there is sugar. One dol- 
lar's worth of sugar lasts us nearly 
two months, because we use it only 
in the children's cereal and very spar- 
ingly in tea and coffee. In cooking I 
use corn syrup or molasses. Corn

syrup is fine in sweetening- pie filling 
and cake. It can also be used in cus- 
tards and many other ways. 

Then for the fats. Why should we 
use lard or suet or butter in shorten- 
ing and frying when we have such 
splendid articles made from vegeta- 
bles and nuts? Why not use Mazola 
oil, Wesson oil, olive oil, Cottolene 
and Crisco and Kaola? They are more 
nourishing, go much farther and give 
the food a flavor that lard, butter and 
suet never do. 

I am submitting some lunch menus 
and recipes that I have worked out 
with the idea of conserving sugar and 
fats. I hope they meet with your ap- 
proval. 

Ripe olives can be bought for 10 
cents a small can, and are much bet-, 
ter than the green olives. 

I use no white flour any more. I do 
all my own baking and use only 
whole wheat flour. Why use white 
flour when whole wheat is much bet- 
ter and our allies need flour so badly? 

I have a conservation card in my 
front window and am trying my best 
to live up to my pledge. Let Port- 
land housewives not be selfish, but 
be willing to share with those less 
fortunate, and help the cause of free- 
dom and justice to all our fellowmen.

spoonfuls onto an oiled baking pan or 
sheet, and bake 15 minutes in a mod- 
erate oven. Makes about 18 cakes, or 
about 9c per dozen. 

As molasses cakes spread, they 
should not be put into the pan close 
enough to touch each other. If de- 
sired, the cakes may be baked in muf- 
fin pans or by adding more flour and 
making stiff enough to handle, may 
be made into cookies. They are very 
cheap, and easily made, and children 
love them. — Mrs. Grace Howard.

Mrs. Taylor's prices are rather in- 
definite and hard to obtain, so I will 
print them as she has them, as they 
are very nearly correct. The value of 
these lunch menus is more in their 
suggestiveness for a variety in nour- 
ishing lunches than for the fractional 
difference in cost.

PICNIC LUNCH BY MRS. WILLIAMS. 

Before one can plan upon a picnic 
lunch, the time, the place and the 
company should be given great con- 
sideration. In my lunch I shall plan 
for 10 adults off for a day of pleasure 
at some mountain stream. Fish must 
be caught and can be fried or roasted 
on a wire before the fire. Three loaves 
home-made bread, V2 pound butter, 
two glasses of jelly, one pint home- 
made pickles, one pint olives, two 
quarts of baked beans, taken in the 
pan in which they were baked, and 
this reheated in a hole in the ground 
where a fire has been; two green cur- 
rant pies, two quarts potato salad, V2 
pint cream, 1% cups extra fine ground 
coffee. Take also salt, pepper and 
lettuce leaves to cover paper plates. 
This will keep your plate clean for 
the various courses. You will also 
need paper napkins, sugar, one fry- 
ing pan, one small can Crisco or olive 
oil to fry your fish. 

Coffee at a Picnic. 

Dig a hole in the ground about six 
to eight inches deep and dig an open- 
ing to this hole on one side for a 
draught. Now place some flat rocks 
around the upper edge and set a pail 
half full of water on the stones, build 
your fire and the water will boil in 
a few minutes. Have 15 tablespoon- 
fuls coffee in a cheese cloth bag, put 
in coffee pot, pour on boiling water 
and let stand over the fire five min- 
utes. This will make 20 cups of 
strong coffee. — Mrs. W. W. Williams, 
1411 Rodney avenue, city. 

(Mrs. Williams did not price her 
recipes, so I will not try to do so.)

War Holiday Dinner Menus 



To Serve Six People, a "Company Din- 
ner," for Not Over 50 Cents Each, or 
$3 for the Whole Dinner. 

Requirements — Every item, includ- 
ing- fuel, must be priced, with recipes 
for each item of food on the menu, ex- 
cept such things as celery, oranges, 
etc., which are served as they are, 
without any additions to their cost. 
Pickles, jelly, etc., "put up" at home, 
priced just half what the same amount 
of the best quality of that item sells 
for at your grocery. We require a 
soup, a meat, with white potatoes and 
at least one other cooked vegetable, 
a salad, a dessert, coffee and nuts or 
fruit. (No candies this year.) Please 
remember above all things that this 
is a War Thanksgiving, and do not 
use the meats our government wants 
conserved, but use any of the meats 
or meat substitutes we spent the 
whole month of October upon. Pish or 
sea food of any kind, any kind of 
wild game or poultry except turkey, 
which we agreed not to have, as too 
expensive. Why not have some of 
our delicious raisin brown bread? 

Challenge every item in your old 
standby recipes for sugar and fats. 
"Save the fats!" "Save the sugar!" If 
you can't, and use that recipe, look 
up some other recipe and make some- 
thing else this year. We are going 
to have four prizes this week on this 
work. 

Our First Prize, for the best con- 
servation menu, in which each and 
every item of each and every recipe 
in the whole menu meets Mr. Hoover's 
requests of us. 

Second Prize — For the second best 
menu, as in the first prize. 

Third Prize — For the menu that 
gives the most and best food, with the 
most courses and little extras, for the 
money. 

Fourth Prize — For the second best 
menu, as in the third prize, 

Our Menus. 

Here are many holiday menus, all 
"good enough to eat," cooked as 
our experienced home cooks know 
how to cook them to beat the world. 
A dainty and pampered appetite may 
prefer an expensive hotel dinner, but 
as for me, and ninety-nine men out of 
a hundred will agree with me, no 
holiday dinner was ever so good 
as the one cooked by the dear 
home people, each item chosen to 
please some one of us particularly, 
and every single thing cooked, fla- 
vored with love and good will for 



the dear ones who were to eat it. I 
believe there is a spiritual quality in 
such food, that is lacking In much of 
our modern rushing life. 

First Prize — For the best con- 
servation menu, in which each and 
every item of each and every recipe 
in the whole menu meets Mr. Hoover's 
requests of us. This was won by Mrs. 
W. W. Williams, 1411 Rodney avenue, 
city, with the following menu:

leave out her cheese delight, but I'm 
absolutely sure that it is the best 
thing that could happen to the people 
who are to eat all those other deli- 
cious things she cooks, as we don't

— Mrs, Lulu M. Welch. 

(If we use cranberries we must 
have sugar to sweeten them, but why 
not substitute some of our delicious 
uncooked loganberry jam — which we 
made before Mr. Hoover asked us to 
"save the sweets" — or better yet, ap- 
ple jelly made by boiling down apple 
juice until it jellies, without a parti- 
cle of sugar. It is just as tart and 
delicious as the cranberry, and a 
change is always welcome. Don't 
have cranberry sauce this year.)

This salad dressing is delicious and 
serves as a very useful way of using 
up a little cream which may have 
soured. The bowl should be rubbed 
with a piece of onion, then the ingre- 
dients added, in order named, thor- 
oughly mixing with egg beater. 

Lettuce must be washed and thor- 
oughly dried, kept in cool place to 
become crisp. Radishes are washed 
and sliced. Tomatoes peeled carefully 
without the use of hot water to con- 
serve their flavor. Arrange peas in a 
mound of lettuce leaves, arrange to- 
matoes, sliced, around peas and gar- 
nish the whole with sliced radishes. 
Pour on dressing just before serving.

below may be done while chicken is 

stewing. 

Select a plump fat hen if possible. 
Clean carefully, cut in pieces. The 
breast should be made into four 
pieces so that, with the wings, a piece 
of white meat may be served each of 
six people. The two pieces of back, 
legs, thighs and neck with the jib- 
lets will allow sufficient of the dark 
meat for each. Cover chicken with 
water, should be about two quarts; 
add onions and 1 tablespoonful salt; 
bring to a boil and keep boiling mod- 
erately until perfectly tender; add re- 
mainder of salt, the rice and flour to 
thicken. 

The washed rice should be put into 
kettle of rapidly boiling water and 
kept boiling for a half hour or until 
tender and fluffy, then drained care- 
fully before adding to chicken.

a "war garden" Thanksgiving dinner 
menu, the greater part of which, with 
the exception of the meat, was grown 
in my small garden, and as a few

also.

cooked; add about one-third of the 
fresh green celery leaves, finely 
chopped; one tomato, or if you have 
not any more fresh ones, keep out a 
little of the canned you intend using 
at the dinner, also add one-half cup- 
ful rice. Cook until rice is done. Add 
a little pepper. Serve with crackers. 

Baked Chicken. 

Cost. 

1 4-lb. hen, at 25c per lb $1.0000 

y 2 loaf stale war bread, or less, 

with some mashed potatoes.. .0300 

1 large onion minced (1 c) 0167 

1 T salt 0008 

1 t mixed ground spices for 
seasoning (pepper, cloves, 
allspice, mustard, sage, celery, 

salt) 0083 

1 cooking egg, home preserved .0400 

Cost $1.0958 

Cut up fowl into regular pieces, as 
for stewing. If hen is very fat, re- 
move all fat possible, as there will be 
plenty left for seasoning. Boil slowly 
until almost done in two or three 
quarts of water, salting after it has 
been boiled a while and skimmed. 
Add hot water occasionally to keep 
meat well covered. In about three 
and a half hours, depending on age 
of hen, have prepared dressing like 
this. Chop up the giblets. Fry them 
in some of the chicken fat. Add the 
minced onion and fry a little. Then 
have the bread moistened with hot 
water. Add giblets and onion, a little 
salt, the ground spices, and last the 
egg. Stir together. Place the chicken 
in a baking pan or roaster, cover with 
the dressing, and if too dry add a 
little soup stock, and brown for about 
one-half hour. 

This manner of cooking gives the 
meat a rich and delicious flavor, hard 
to equal in the best young fry, and is 
an excellent way of preparing the or- 
dinary chicken. One does not always 
know how old a supposed "spring" 
sometimes is.

(Mrs. Shand forgot to add in her 
cream and sugar, so her menu runs 
over 4 cents. This amount can be 
taken out of her cream puffs, as her 
recipe makes double the amount 
really needed, but if her wood fuel 
had been all figured together it would 
have lowered her total more than 
that. Notice particularly her "con- 
servation" mince pie, and the whole 
menu seems very good and economi- 
cal — but please write only on one side 
of the paper. It is so much extra 
work for me when you don't, and I 
haven't time just now.)

Mrs. Hardy says: My Thanksgiving 
dinner is really going to cost a great 
deal less than $3, for the string beans, 
pumpkin, pickles, etc., were raised in 
our war garden and canned for win- 
ter use. The wild blackberries for 
jelly I picked myself. The rooster has 
been raised and fed mostly on table 
scraps. The bread crumbs for stuf- 
fing I save when cutting bread, dry 
and keep in a glass jar. I have used 
no lard or other cooking compound 
for over a year now, as all my pies, 
cookies, cakes, doughnuts are made 
from cottonseed oil, with which I 
have splendid results. A tablespoon- 
ful of the oil in vegetables instead 
of butter is equally satisfactory and 
much more pleasing to Mr. Hoover. In 
my conservation pumpkin pie I use 
a teaspoonful of Egaho powder and 
a teaspoonful of corn starch, instead 
of an egg, for while the egg substi- 
tute does not contain the nourish- 
ment of an egg, it has no harmful in- 
gredients, and in this kind of a din- 
ner there is plenty to nourish one 
without the egg in the pie.

II row 11 Bread. 

I have figured we will eat about 
10 cents worth of brown bread made 
by this recipe. Save 1 pint of potato 
water and add to it 2 medium sized 
potatoes, mashed fine; warm and dis- 
solve in it 1 cake Fleschmann's yeast 
and Vz tablespoonful sugar and whole 
wheat flour for a stiff batter. Beat 
and set in warm place to rise about 
Vz to 1 hour until bubbles show on 
top. Use 3 cups Ralston bran and 3 
cups graham flour. Put in bread pan, 
make a hollow, add 1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 tablespoonful oil, add risen yeast 
and a pint of lukewarm water. Beat

Should some little variations in 
price be noted in the foregoing 
recipes, please understand that this 
work extended over a period of four 
months, and recipes were priced in 
accordance with the prices current on 
the Public Market when written. 
However, most of the recipes have 
been revised to conform to the prices 
of October 31, 19^17, given on pages 35, 
36 and 37. 

The value of all this pricing (as 



has been said elsewhere) is always 
more in the comparative than in the 
absolute cost. I trust it will prove 
as helpful to all who use this cook 
book in ascertaining which recipes 
are most economical, as it has to the 
ladies whose recipes fill this book, 
and who are entitled to your appre- 
ciation of their capable, disinterested 
and patriotic work.
