PREFACE 

THIS BOOK is gotten up to meet the wants of young- 
housekeepers who wish to use plain practical methods of 
keeping house in such manner that they do not spend all 
or even one-half their days in the kitchen ; who wish to 
manage their household so sensibly that the feeling of 
drudgery is removed, and they can be "chief cook and 
bottle washer" if necessary, yet meet with a smile the 
husband coming for meals. 

And for the "tired out" housekeeper who spends so much 
time planning and executing the family cooking and the 
serving of varied and elaborate meals, that she has no 
time to devote to the so-called recreations of life, fre- 
quently feeling obliged to give up everything to prevent 
a "complete nervous breakdown." 

If your children hear constant talk regarding food and 
its preparation, unless they learn better later on, they 
will most likely consider eating the chief thing in life. 
While every one must eat, let each one endeavor to make 
the preparation and the partaking of the daily meals a 
pleasure to the cook, and the manager of the cook. For 
unless a house is run on one or two "flat wheels" (as the 
streetcar men express it), there must be a manager. 
This book is also a plea for "the simple life" in a sensible 
way. 

We are independent beings, and we must decide our 
course for ourselves. If any of these things appeal to 
your thinking selves, use and enjoy them. If not, just 

7 



8 PREFACE 

ignore them, but, do not dictate as to the right or wrong 
of your neighbor's using them. You remember Epictetus 
said "Does a man bathe quickly? do not say that he 
bathes badly, but that he bathes quickly. For unless you 
perfectly understand the principle from which he acts, 
how do you know whether he is acting wrong." 
The aim in this book is not to present an immense variety 
of recipes, but a number of good, plain, wholesome dishes ; 
with directions for using and not wasting ingredients. 
The housekeeper need not be what is termed "stingy," 
but it is criminal to waste, and statistics prove that no 
other nation is so prodigal as the American. So let the 
women, the rulers of the house, see to it that they are 
doing their part in benefiting mankind. "Charity begins 
at home." Attend to yours. 



SUGGESTIONS FOR STARTING 
THE DAY 

You will find, by sometimes pleasant experience (some- 
times the reverse) that rising before 6.30 o'clock summer 
mornings, and before 7 in winter, is conducive to a smooth 
day. Of course, this is under ordinary conditions and 
environments. You have time to "do" your hair and 
don a neat shirt waist or dressing jacket and skirt. If a 
plain tulle veil to match the hair in color is fastened lightly 
over the head, it does not look unsightly, and may be 
removed before luncheon, a curl or puff (as the style may 
be) added, if desired, and the hair found dressed for the 
day. It is also surprising how such a filmy, almost un- 
seen, cover prevents dust entering the hair. 
While breakfast is cooking, a carpet sweeper can be run 
over rugs in the downstairs rooms; the hardwood floors 
wiped with a "dustless duster" (which absorbs the dust 
and polishes at the same time), or with a dust cloth two 
feet square made by stitching old stockings together. 
After breakfast, a few moments will suffice for the dust- 
ing of furniture and bric-a-brac, and the first floor is 
cleaned for the day. 

Dusters should be frequently shaken out-of-doors while 
dusting. 

After the breakfast work is done, the upstairs can be ar- 
ranged and dusted. 

All bath-rooms, wash bowls and toilets should then be 

9 



10 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

left in absolute cleanliness, and hardwood stairs wiped 
with a dust cloth if necessary In some houses, twice a 
week is sufficient to clean stairs and bathroom floors, and 
once in four weeks for cleaning windows. 
If the work in a house is attended to regularly, there is 
never any need for the old fashioned "House Cleaning." 
Whenever rugs and draperies need cleaning, have them 
cleaned immediately. 

THE KITCHEN SINK 

If it is convenient, by all means have a row of brass hooks 
over the sink, on which to hang the following articles, viz : 
A small three-cornered piece of zinc, each corner differ- 
ing in shape, to use in cleaning corners of pans, etc. Have 
a hole in one corner to hang by. 

A small stiff bristled brush for cleaning vegetables, with 
a screw-eye in one end to hang by. 

A wire dish for holding laundry and toilet soap, and an- 
other for sapolio and a small piece of flannel (or cotton 
cloth). 

A perforated dish into which to empty coffee grounds, 
etc., to prevent stoppage of the sink drain. 
A wire soap shaker to hold scraps of soap. 
An ordinary granite water dipper. 
A medium size sauce pan also utilized for dipping. 
Do not omit a wire dish cloth. 

A long wire with bristles on one end for cleaning bottles. 
A medium size scrubbing brush with pointed ends for 
cleaning the sink with Dutch Cleanser. 
A granite dish pan should hang or be placed near the 
sink, also a granite basin in which to wash vegetables. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 11 

A sink should have boiling water poured in it each day, 
and if signs of stoppage occur, throw in a handful of 
copperas and usually the water poured in during the day 
will dissolve the copperas slowly and clean the pipes. 
On a shelf near the sink it is well to keep a can of Dutch 
Cleanser, a package of borax, if the water is "hard," and 
a package of pearline or similar powder. 

THE KITCHEN FLOOR 

The best linoleum is the most satisfactory and lasting 
cover for kitchen, pantry and back hall floors. It cleans 
beautifully with a scrub brush and naphtha soap, rinsing 
and wiping dry. Ordinarily, once a week is sufficient for 
scrubbing the kitchen, but the floor should be wiped or 
carefully mopped with a small mop at least every other 
day or oftener, if necessary. 

For spots and stains difficult to remove from linoleum, 
Dutch Cleanser is almost a certain remedy. 

THE KITCHEN TABLE 

If possible, have what is termed a combination table, and 
have a tinner cover the top with zinc. On this all hot 
dishes may be set with no ill results, and it is most easy 
to clean. If you can enjoy the luxury of a kitchen cabinet, 
select one with a tall cupboard on top, as that uses space 
otherwise wasted. If not already zinc covered, have 
it done. The cost is small, and the comfort and time sav- 
ing enormous. In the upper drawers in the combination 
table, you can keep whatever articles you wish. But 
somewhere, manage to keep a bunch of papers, for their 



12 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

use is manifold. When gathering the dishes preparatory 
to washing them, always crush several pieces of paper 
and wipe out grease ; wipe off the table with paper when 
grease has been spilled ; and wipe off the stove with 
paper. All this is a great aid to greater comfort in wash- 
ing these things. 

THE GARBAGE 

In some cities a garbage collector calls on certairi days, 
and a convenient way is to keep an old coal hod indoors 
(so as not to attract flies) with a newspaper in it, into 
which to empty garbage as it accumulates during the 
day. This can be easily emptied into an outside garbage 
can each night. 
These matters must be governed by existing conditions. 

AROUND THE KITCHEN STOVE 

Brass hooks are convenient for holding the following, viz : 
Dust pan, soft brush, and old whisk broom. 
Asbestos plates or old shallow baking pans to invert 
under kettles to prevent burning. 

Cover squares of old shoe leather with ticking or any 
material suitable for holders, leaving a space about three 
inches not sewed in one edge of cover through which to 
slip leather when cover is washed. Sew a brass ring to 
one corner to hang by. 

Hem a square of ticking and attach a brass ring to hang 
by, to use in handling hot dishes about the stove. 
A turkey wing is most handy to brush under low furni- 
ture. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 13 

Provide a place for drying dish-cloths and towels. 
For drying glass and silver, make towels of linen, to do 
away with lint. But nothing seems so satisfactory for 
drying china, as the soft towels made from flour and 
sugar bags, the one hundred pound size. 
Knitted dish cloths of fine twine can now be purchased 
in any linen department for a few cents. They are dur- 
able and just right to handle. 
By all means have a nickle tea kettle. 

OTHER HELPS 

Have a small dish in refrigerator or other cool place, into 
which to drop egg shells which are washed before break- 
ing eggs for cooking, and save for settling coffee. 
A good can opener and cork screw. 
A good, not too heavy broom, and an old one. 
Save all worn out flannels and soft cotton underwear for 
cleaning purposes. 

Pieces of medium grade sandpaper tacked over a strip of 
board 4x10 inches, similar to a razor sharpener, is fine for 
whetting knives. 

Always keep a pair of clean shears convenient for cutting 
orange and lemon peel, certain vegetables, etc. 
A rubber window dryer, used on or off the handle. 
Get a good Fireless Cooker. 

And a steam cooker, if you can a copper one, or it will 
rust out, and get it with two doors. 

Three or four empty pound baking powder cans, with 
covers. 

A light weight mop. 
Good scrub brush.

YEAST 

A yeast cake may be kept fresh for a week by burying it 
in the flour. 

A liberal pinch of soda dissolved in a little warm water 
and added to slightly soured yeast will sweeten it. 

EVERLASTING YEAST 

1 cupful mashed potatoes 1 tablespoonful salt 

3 cupfuls lukewarm water 3 tablespoonfuls sugar 

yeast cake }4 teaspoonful ginger 

Peel and boil old potatoes, put through a colander, mix 
with the other ingredients with the yeast dissolved in a 
little warm water. Add the ginger the first time in start- 
ing the yeast, but not again. Let this mixture stand for 
three days before using. When you make bread, repeat 
the formula, omitting the yeast and ginger, add the in- 
gredients to the first mixture and let stand over night. 
In the morning, stir it thoroughly, take out a pint to start 
your next yeast, sift the flour with the remainder, knead 
and put into pans. By noon the bread may be baked. 
This makes three loaves. Keep the yeast in a tight jar, 
and it will keep for about ten days in warm weather. 

MAKING DRY YEAST 

After mixing bread at night, the following morning take 
a large cupful of the light sponge and stir into it dry 
corn meal. Spread it out thinly to dry, stirring occas- 
ionally. When perfectly dry, like coarse powder, it is 

17 



18 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

ready for use, and will keep indefinitely. Use about two 
tablespoonfuls for a medium size baking. 

YEAST 

1 yeast cake 
y t cupful salt 
^2 cupful sugar 

Put the hops in cold water, let boil for five minutes and 
strain. Add potato, salt and sugar, boiling all together 
for five minutes. Have a yeast cake dissolved in a little 
warm water, and when the potato mixture is nearly cold, 
stir in the yeast cake and let rise. 




HELPS ABOUT BREADS 

When the temperature is too low for bread to rise well, 

set the bread pan on folded newspaper or something to 

prevent it getting chilled ; an asbestos mat is good ; cover 

the pan with towels and newspaper; a hot water bag 

filled with hot water and placed on top of these coverings, 

and the bag itself covered, is one of the best helps. 

Always stir in all the flour possible at the first mixing. 

Never fill the bread pans over half full. 

Knead the dough into loaves, let rise, work over again, 

let rise in the pans and bake. 

If you mix bread dough with water, your loaves will 

stand a hotter fire than when mixed with milk. 

If flour is warmed before mixing bread in cold weather, 

it will aid in the rising. 

Too much kneading is unnecessary. 

One cupful of liquid yeast is equal to one dried yeast cake 

or about three-fourths of a compressed yeast cake. 

A little sugar sprinkled on the bottom of the oven helps 

brown the top of your loaves. 

For sandwich making, bake the bread in one pound baking 

powder cans, filling them half full of the dough. 

Some good cooks add one teaspoonful of glycerine to 

every four cupfuls of flour in making bread. It makes the 

dough "richer." 

KEEPING BREAD FRESH 

As soon as bread is cold, put each loaf in a paper bag, 

19 



20 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

putting the bags in an earthen jar with cover, or in a 

bread tin. 

A dish containing a wet sponge set inside the bread tin is 

good. Of course, see that the sponge is kept sweet. And 

a cut apple inside the bread tin helps. 

Bread wrapped in paraffin paper before being placed in 

the jar or box, keeps well. 

STALE BREAD 

Dip stale loaves in water, quickly removing to a hot oven 
for about ten minutes. 

When not needed as bread, put stale pieces through the 
chopper and save every crumb in a receptacle covered 
with a cloth, not with a tight cover, to prevent mold. 

CUTTING BREAD 

Tie a piece of coarse white thread or common twine 
around the hot bread where you wish to cut. It cuts per- 
fectly smooth and straight.

EGGS 

BEATING EGGS 

A teaspoonful of cold water added to the white of an egg, 
makes it whip more quickly, as well as increase in 
quantity. 

A pinch of salt will make white of an egg whip more 
quickly. 

Add a pinch of cream of tartar while whipping white of 
egg, to keep from falling afterward. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS 

Add one quart fresh slaked lime to two gallons of water, 
pour into a cask and put in the eggs till ready for use. 
They will keep for months. 

Eggs may be kept for months in table salt. 

Or to three gallons of water add one pint fresh slaked 
lime and one-half pint table salt. Keep the eggs always 
covered in the brine. 

EGG SUBSTITUTE 

One tablespoonful of corn starch is equal to one egg. 
Try it in doughnuts. 

Unused yolks should be put in a cold place in an un- 
covered glass of water, where they will keep several days. 

If a small piece of shell gets in a broken egg, take a piece 

34 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 35 

of shell and the smaller piece will adhere to it, so it may 
be easily removed. 

When a bit of yolk gets in with the white in separating 
the parts, touch the yolk with a piece of dry cloth and it 
will adhere to it.

an hour or more in a mixing bowl. Add the butter, stir 
well, and pour in a small deep bread pan. With a spoon, 
make six depressions the size of an egg, break the eggs 
into these hollows, and bake thirty minutes. 

BOILED EGGS 

Cover eggs in cold water, and remove after water has 
boiled two minutes if soft boiled eggs are desired, boiling 
longer for hard boiled. 

Whenever soft boiled eggs are left over, boil them hard 
at once, so they may be utilized cold. 

DEVILED EGGS No. 1

PIES 

When a pie is ready to bake, pour cold water over it, drain 
quickly and place immediately in hot oven. 

If a lower crust is wet with the beaten white of an egg 
before filling with soft mixtures, it will prevent filling 

from soaking in. 

Do not take hot pies suddenly to a cold room, as the 

sudden change makes them "heavy." And do not leave 

them on a hot stove after being baked. 

Grease pie plates with butter. It helps make a flaky 

crust. 

A strip of clean muslin about two inches wide, wrung 
from cold water and pinned around the edge of juicy pies, 
will keep juice in and keep edge from burning. 

Another plan is to insert a small funnel of white paper, 
small end down, in the center of the upper crust, for the 
escape of steam. 

Sprinkle a little flour over a lower crust before filling in 
juicy pies. 

A very good way to prevent juice running out, is to put 
the sugar in the lower crust before filling in the fruit. 

See that under crusts around outer edge are loose from 
pie plates before baking. 

Under crusts to be baked a day before using, are made 
even by baking one crust between two pie plates of the 
same size. 

94 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 95 

CINNAMON ROLLS 

Whenever pie crust dough is left, cut in narrow strips, 
spread with softened butter, sprinkle with sugar and 
cinnamon, roll and bake like a jelly roll. 

SHORTCAKE 

Use directions for Baking Powder Biscuit. Cut open the 
biscuits, butter well, and spread with whatever fruit is 
in season. Place the upper half of the biscuit over the 
under piece with its crust down, that is, on the fruit, 
spreading another layer of the sugared fruit on the top, 
with whipped cream above this top layer, if desired. 

Berries, pineapple, oranges, etc., etc., are all nice in short- 
cakes.

a pinch of baking powder 

Sift the flour and baking powder together, add the salt 
and the softened (not warm) butter, then the water. 
Turn onto a floured moulding board, sift a little flour 
over and turn over till right to roll out. This makes just 
two pie crusts, or a lower crust for one pie, and four small 
biscuits.

the floured moulding board in a soft dough, roll, and fit 
on the pie plate. 

APPLE PIE 

Have ready, apples peeled and cut in thin slices, or apples 
that have been cooked like Apple Sauce. Line a pie plate 
with crust. 

A little chopped fresh lemon peel sprinkled over the fruit 
is a tasty addition. Or powdered lemon peel flavoring 
is fine. 

A teaspoonful of strong cold tea added to the apple sauce 
filling is nice. 

FRIED APPLE PIE 

Roll out Baking Powder Biscuit dough to about one- 
quarter inch in thickness, and cut in circles about five 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 97 

inches in diameter. A tin can cover that size is a good 
cutter. Fill the center of half this round piece with about 
one tablespoonful Apple Sauce. Moisten the edge of 
dough with cold water, folding the empty half over the 
sauce, pressing the two edges tightly together making a 
pie shaped like a half circle. Fry like doughnuts in hot 
cooking oil. Drain them on clean brown paper. Eaten 
hot or cold, with cheese if desired.

PUMPKINS AND PIES 

Pumpkin may be grated raw and used as when cooked, 
making less work to prepare. 

Grating, now-a-days, usually means running through the 
food chopper. 

A pumpkin may be baked by cutting it in two, removing 
seeds, scooping it from the shell with a mixing spoon and 
crushing through a colander. 

In selecting a pumpkin, choose a glossy one that is flat on 
both ends. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 101

eight dumplings, not too thick, the size of a biscuit. 

THE SAUCE 

Use Pudding Sauce No. 1 and substitute a little ground 
cinnamon for lemon flavoring. 

Place a clean piece of white cotton cloth over the kettle 
after putting dumplings in, fit the cover on closely and 
your dumplings will not "fall."

MEMORANDA 



ABOUT MILK 

TO TEST MILK 

Put a bright steel knitting needle in the milk and if on 
withdrawing it, the milk runs off slowly, it is pure ; if it 
runs quickly, the milk has been diluted with water. 

Milk absorbs all strong odors, and should never be placed 
near them. 

A pinch of soda added to a quart of milk before putting it 
on to boil, will prevent curdling. 

When milk boils over, sprinkle salt on it to prevent the 
smell. 

Usually when milk or foodstuffs burn on the kettle, if it 
is instantly set in a dish of cold water, the contents of 
the kettle may be removed without tasting burned. 

When you wish to scald or boil milk, rinse the dish with 
cold water, pour the milk in immediately and it will not 
stick to the dish. 

Sour milk is best when it sours quickly. If it is too thick, 
beat until light with an egg beater.

1 cupful sour milk J/ teaspoonful soda 

Yz cupful butter 1 teaspoonful salt 

4 cupfuls flour y 2 grated nutmeg 

Cream sugar and softened butter, add beaten eggs, half 
the flour, soda dissolved in a little water, spice, salt, and 
flour enough to form a soft dough. Turn on the mould- 
ing board and work in more flour if necessary to have 
mixture roll out one-half inch in thickness. Take one- 
half the entire mixture to roll at a time, cut with a dough- 
nut cutter and fry in hot cooking oil. This makes fifty 
doughnuts. 

A tablespoonful of molasses added to this recipe is good. 

BAKING POWDER DOUGHNUTS 

1 cupful sugar 2 eggs 

1 cupful milk 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder 

5^2 cupful butter 1 teaspoonful salt 

4 cupfuls flour 1 teaspoonful vanilla flavoring 

Cream sugar and softened butter, add beaten eggs, half 
the flour, flavoring, salt and more flour with baking 
powder sifted in. Stir in all the flour possible, turn on a 
moulding board, working in only enough flour to make 
the mixture roll into a soft one-half inch dough. Then 
proceed as in Doughnuts. 



123 



AS TO BAKING CAKES 

Slamming the oven door will often cause a cake to be- 
come heavy. 

A little flour sprinkled over buttered paper in cake tins 
prevents cakes sticking. 

When creaming butter and sugar for cake, if the butter 
is pressed through a perforated potato masher, it is done 
very easily and satisfactorily. 

Stale cake may be freshened by immersing quickly in 
cold milk and placing immediately in the oven for a few 
moments. 

A wooden toothpick is good for testing cakes in the oven. 
If the wood comes out perfectly dry, the cake is done. 

Raisins should be washed a day before using, placed in a 
wire basket and plunged quickly in a dish of boiling 
water. Spread on a platter or towel and dry. 

Flavoring can be sprinkled over the cake dough after it 
is in the pan, in case of the flavoring being forgotten till 
then. 

Stirring in lightly is usually the same as "folding" in. 
If a pan of water is placed in the oven your cake will 
never burn. 

A piece of paper placed across the top of a pan of cake 
when first set in the oven, will prevent it from rising 
unevenly. 

To remove a cake inclined to stick to the pan after baking, 

124 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 125 

set the tin immediately on a thick cloth wrung from hot 
water and after five minutes, the cake can be turned out 
without breaking. 

Chopped nut meats may be added to almost any cake, 
for a change. 

Pour one-half the batter to fruit cake into the pan be- 
fore adding the fruit, stirring fruit into the batter left 
in the mixing bowl, then pouring the mixture over that 
already in the pan, and fruit will not all sink to the 
bottom. 

A cake without butter must be baked in a quick oven. 
Fruit cakes and most dark cakes should bake slowly. 

If sour milk is used in baking, use one-half teaspoonful 
of soda to each cupful. If sweet milk is used, baking 
powder is the usual accompaniment, and should be one 
and a half teaspoonfuls baking powder to each cupful 
of flour. 

ORNAMENTING CAKES 

Crystallized mint leaves and violets and candied fruits 
can be formed into most artistic decorations for cakes. 
To fasten candles on cakes, push a hot hat pin or knitting 
needle in the bottom of candle, remove and put a wooden 
toothpick in while wax is soft. After the wax hardens 
around the pick the candle may be easily placed in posi- 
tion on the cake.

HOT BEVERAGES 

CHOCOLATE 

Take a piece of Baker's chocolate one inch square and 
melt on a small dish on the stove, set in another dish of 
hot water over a teakettle of boiling water, or in the 
oven. Heat two cupfuls milk, stir in melted chocolate 
and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Serve with cream 
and sugar, if desired. 

A marshmallow may be dropped in each cup just before 
serving. 

A drop of vanilla may be added to each cup. 

COFFEE 

Have a large bottomed granite coffee pot (because it 
heats quickly and does not boil over). Take one heaping 
tablespoonful of ground coffee for each person and one 
extra tablespoonful for "the pot." Crush in the hand 
two or more egg shells (saved for this purpose), stir in 
with the coffee, add one and one-fourth cupfuls cold water 
for each person ; boil three minutes, allow to remain hot, 
but not boiling, about two or more minutes. 

This makes one cup delicious clear strong coffee for each. 

If more than this is desired, add coffee and water in the 
same proportion. When serving, pour the coffee on the 
cream, not cream on the coffee. 

Add a tiny pinch of salt to coffee for an agreeable flavor.

PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 159 

Adding half a dozen raisins to a pot of coffee is a pleas- 
ing change. 

A pinch of flour added to the coffee before water is 
poured over, is another way of "settling." 

When cream is slightly soured, a little soda stirred in 
will restore its sweetness for use in coffee. 

DRIP COFFEE 

Pour boiling water into a drip coffee pot to get it hot, 
then pour it out, and put one tablespoonful finely ground 
coffee in the bag, fasten it in and pour over it two cupfuls 
freshly boiling water. When the water has drained 
through the bag, pour it in again, drain, and continue 
to pour and drain four times. Remove the bag and if the 
coffee is too strong, add boiling water. Be sure to clean 
the bag by scraping off the grounds with a knife, wash- 
ing it in cold water, and having it perfectly dry before 
using again. Serve the coffee with cream. This coffee 
is made in five minutes and is delicious. 

TEA 

For a teapot holding about four cupfuls, put in two tea- 
spoonfuls tea, pour in freshly boiling water, set in a 
warm place to stand five minutes before serving. Milk 
should never be used with tea, and only a little cream, if 
any. To take it with lemon juice is considered by experts 
the proper way to drink it.

CANDIES AND SWEETS 

FONDANT 

This is the foundation for most candies, and should be 
kept a day or two before using. With it almost an end- 
less variety of candies may be made, viz : 

2 cupfuls sugar 1 cupful water 

J4 teaspoonful cream of tartar 

Put these ingredients to boil, not stirring after sugar i? 
dissolved. After about five minutes try it in cold water, 
to see if it can be moulded by hand. Beware of cooking 
it too long. Let cool gradually, then stir briskly till 
creamy and ready to knead by hand. Work in a little 
sugar if the mass becomes sticky. Set away in an earthen 
dish covered with a damp cloth for a day or two. Then 
flavor and form into candies of any preferred kind. 

BUTTER SCOTCH 

1 cupful sugar ^ cupful butter 

% cupful molasses 2 tablespoonfuls boiling water 

1 tablespoonful vinegar 

Boil all together till it hardens in cold water. Pour into

Boil water, sugar and cream of tartar till it hairs. Re- 

160 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 161 

move from fire and add peppermint, beating constantly 
till it begins to cool, when it must be dropped quickly 
from a teaspoon on buttered or paraffin paper. When 
cold, dip in the melted chocolate and return to paper to 
harden. 

If the melted chocolate becomes curdled, add a little 
olive oil. 

Any desired flavoring may be used.

the water, molasses, sugar and vinegar. When it will 
hair, add butter. When the mixture hardens, in cold 
water, add soda and pour over corn, stirring with a mix- 
ing spoon. Dip the hands in cold water and form the 
mixture into balls, continuing to dip the hands in cold 
water when making each ball, working rapidly before 
the syrup hardens. It is sometimes necessary to keep 
the dish containing the mixture in another dish of hot 
water to prevent hardening before balls are formed. Keep 
the finished balls in a cold place. 

PULLED CREAM CANDY 

4 Ibs. sugar water 

1 teaspoonful cream of tartar flavoring 

Use enough water to cover sugar in which cream of tartar 



164 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

has been stirred in a stew pan, boil this till it hardens 
slightly in cold water. Flavor, pour in buttered tins, and 
pull when cool enough to handle.

tinuing to beat until the mixture holds its shape. Add 
nuts, flavor, and drop from a teaspoon on paraffin paper. 

CANDIED MINT LEAVES 
mint fondant syrup 

Prepare fondant as per Fondant recipe. When the syrup 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 165 

is boiled so it will "hair," remove from fire, stir a little 
and dip each small spray of mint in it, laying them on 
buttered paper to harden. 

CANDIED ORANGE AND LEMON PEEL 

Cut fresh peel from four oranges into one-half inch strips 
with scissors. Put in cold water, let boil five minutes, 
pour off this water, put into cold water and boil five 
minutes more, pour off this water, put into cold water 
and boil five minutes more for the third time. Make a 
syrup of one-half cupful water and one cupful granulated 
sugar, boil till begins to thicken, throw in peel, stirring 
constantly till syrup candies on peel. Turn candied peel 
into a colander to drain, then roll in sugar. 

CANDIED VIOLETS 

Violets may be prepared the same as Candied Mint 
leaves. The syrup may be colored by using grape juice, 
and the stems made green with spinach leaves crushed and 
juice added to the fondant. 



JELLIES, PRESERVES AND 
CANNED FRUITS 

Never cook fruit in dishes of tin or iron. 

To prevent mould gathering on preserves, keep a pan of 
lime on the shelves of the fruit closet, and have the closet 
dark and cool. 

When newly-made jelly is a trifle too thin, set the glasses 
in a pan and put in the warming oven until of the right 
consistency. 

One way to see if jelly has cooked sufficiently is to try 
it with a spoon. If it runs from the spoon in drops, not in 
a stream, it is cooked enough. 

When jellies refuse to "jell," add a pinch of powdered 
alum. 

If the preserving kettle be placed in a pan of boiling 
water, the contents can cook any length of time without 
burning, and need but occasional stirring. 

Sprinkling ashes on the stove lid under a kettle of boiling 
fruit will prevent the fruit burning on the bottom of the 
kettle. 

Drop half a dozen small agate marbles into the kettle 
of jelly. The marbles will keep in constant motion and 
prevent the juice from burning. 

HEAT SUGAR FOR JELLY 

Place the sugar in a granite dish in the oven and stir fre- 

166 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 167 

quently till all portions of the sugar are heated. Do not 
close the oven door. 

JELLY BAGS AND GLASSES 

Make a jelly bag from coarse white flannel, pointed on 
the bottom. Bind the top and sew strong loops to sus- 
pend it by. The little hair like threads on the flannel seem 
to hold every little roughness, making the juice perfectly 
clear. Have the bag as large as will hang in the kettle. 
Put a stout stick through the loops and suspend it in 
the kettle with enough cold water to cover the fruit. 
Cook until soft, lifting the bag occasionally to stir 
the fruit about. When the fruit is cooked very soft, sus- 
pend the bag in a convenient place to drip till morning. 
Do not squeeze it. In the morning, add the juice from 
the bag to that in the kettle, let boil about twenty min- 
utes, add an equal quantity of sugar and boil about ten 
minutes more. This is the usual way to make jelly. 

JELLY GLASSES 

Have them very clean, place in a large pan on the fire 
in cold water, and heat to boiling point. Turn glasses 
upside down to drain, then place quickly on a cloth wrung 
out of hot water. Fill the glasses and set aside for a day, 
then cover the jelly with melted paraffin, pouring it in the 
glasses from an old tea pot or gravy dish. When a glass 
is opened, save the paraffin and use it over and over. 

EASY WAY FOR JELLY 

Berries and soft fruit may be washed and crushed, placed 



168 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

in a cheese cloth bag and squeezed carefully. Measure 
the juice and put in a kettle and boil ten minutes. Add 
an equal quantity of heated sugar, boil five minutes, and 
pour into glasses. 

APPLE JELLY 

Select perfect fruit, wash, cut out all imperfect parts, re- 
move stems and cores, and put in a kettle with cold water 
to cover. Boil slowly till apples are soft. Strain through 
a jelly bag, and suspend the bag to drip over night. Next 
morning, add the juice to that in the kettle, boil twenty 
minutes, add an equal amount of heated sugar. Let boil 
ten minutes, skim and turn into glasses. 

A few quinces added to apples make a delicious jelly. 

A rose geranium leaf placed in the bottom of a glass 
before pouring the apple jelly in it, will impart a delight- 
ful flavor. 

A drop of oil of cinnamon put in apple jelly is much liked 
by many. 

A handful of cherry leaves thrown into apple jelly while 
boiling will give the jelly a perfect cherry flavor. The 
leaves may be removed after boiling about twenty 
minutes. 

APPLE AND FIG JAM 

Wash and wipe the desired quantity of apples, cut in 
two, but do not peel or core, remove stem, cover with 
cold water and cook till soft. Pour in a jelly bag to 
strain. Cut each fig of the desired quantity into three 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 169 

or four pieces, cover with cold water and cook till soft, 
then cool. After the figs are cold, stir in with the apple 
juice and sugar, using one pint of sugar to one pint of 
juice, and two cupfuls figs to four pints of juice. Boil this 
mixture till it jellies, then put it in sealed jars. 

Part of this jam may be flavored with a little whole ginger. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Cook one quart cranberries in one cupful of water for ten 
minutes. Put through a sieve, add one cupful of sugar, 
stir till sugar is dissolved, then pour into glasses. Do not 
allow juice to boil after adding sugar. 

CURRANT JELLY 

Wash and remove imperfect berries, but not stems. 
Mash, bring to the boiling point and simmer till currants 
are colorless. Strain through a jelly bag. Let drip over 
night. Next morning, measure the juice and boil for five 
minutes. Add an equal quantity of heated sugar, boil 
five minutes and pour into glasses. 

Currants and raspberries make one of the very best jellies. 

GRAPE JELLY 

Pick over the grapes, wash and remove from stems. Put 
in a kettle, heat to boiling point, mash and boil twenty 
minutes. Put through a colander, then through a jelly 
bag to drip till morning. Measure the juice and boil ten 
minutes. Add an equal quantity of heated sugar, boil 
five minutes and pour into glasses. 



170 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

RED RASPBERRY JELLY 

Pick over the berries, wash and cook slowly till soft, 
using one cupful of hot water to each quart of berries. 
Let drip all night in a jelly bag. Next morning, measure 
the juice and allow an equal quantity of heated sugar. 
Cook enough apples to make one cupful of apple juice, 
strain, add to the berry juice and boil twenty minutes. 

Add the sugar and stir until dissolved, cook five minutes 
longer and turn into glasses. 

RHUBARB JELLY 

Wash, and cut rhubarb into small pieces, put in a kettle 
with cold water to cover and boil till soft. Let drip 
through a jelly bag over night. Do not squeeze. Meas- 
ure the juice next morning, and allow an equal quantity 
of heated sugar. Boil the juice fifteen minutes, add sugar 
and boil five minutes. To each quart add one teaspoonful 
of gelatine dissolved in a little cold water. As soon as 
gelatine is dissolved in the juice, pour into glasses. 

DRIED FRUIT JELLY 

Wash the fruit, let soak over night and cook in the same 
water. Cook till tender and proceed as in making Apple 
Jelly. 

ORANGE MARMALADE 

Wash and cut the peel in quarters from eight oranges and 
four lemons. Cook the peel until soft in enough boiling 
water to cover. Save four cups of this water and pour it 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 171 

over three quarts of sugar. Scrape the white insides of 
the peelings with a spoon, throwing this inside lining 
away, and cut the peelings in narrow strips with the scis- 
sors. Remove the seeds and the tough skin from the 
orange, dividing it into small sections. Then cook the 
syrup, pulp and peelings all together for nearly one hour. 

CARROT PRESERVES 

Wash and scrape three pounds of carrots, steam until 
tender, add two quarts of sugar, grated rind and juice of 
six lemons, and one-half cupful chopped almonds. Cook 
thirty-five minutes. 

LEMON RIND PRESERVE 

During the summer, whenever lemonade is made, after 
squeezing the lemons, drop the shells into a jar of fresh 
water, keep it in the ice box and change the water twice 
a week. At the time of changing, drops of pure oil of 
lemon will be found floating on the water. Put these 
drops carefully in a bottle. After about two weeks, 
scrape the white inside out with a spoon and throw it 
away. Weigh the shells and add an equal weight of 
sugar and cook slowly till thick. 

RASPBERRY PRESERVES 

Take an equal weight of fruit and sugar. It is usually 
cupful for cupful. Cook one-fourth of the fruit till soft. 
Strain it, and pour the juice in the kettle with the sugar, 
stirring till sugar is dissolved. Put in the remainder of 
the fruit and boil for five minutes. Dip out the fruit and 



172 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

put in jars till nearly full. Boil the syrup till it jellies, 
pour over the berries till jars are completely filled, and 
seal. 

If a tablespoonful of glycerine be added to each pound of 
fruit used in making jam, it will prevent crystallization. 

FRUIT JARS 

Turn fruit jars upside down to prevent fruit becoming 
mouldy. 

Put a teaspoonful of pulverized borax into a pan of cold 
water, put the jars in the pan and set on the fire till the 
water is at boiling point. Remove the jars, place on a 
cloth wrung from hot water, and fill immediately with 
fruit. Put on one rubber and screw on the cover. Let stand 
till just cool enough to handle, and to harden the paraffin. 
Pour the paraffin all over the rubber where it touches the 
jar and where it hits the cover. When opening jars, save 
the paraffin and use again. 

When a fruit jar cover refuses to come off, run a knife 
around the jar under the rubber band, and the cover will 
loosen immediately. 

SAVING PEELINGS 

Whenever apples, peaches or similar fruits are peeled, 
dry the peelings, and at preserving time they are fine for 
jelly. 

TO REMOVE PEACH SKINS 
Place the fruit in a pan and cover it with boiling water. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 173 

Place another pan of the same size over this, and let 
stand until cool, and the skins will come off almost whole 
in the fingers. And when the peach is cut open, the pit 
will drop out. 

When putting away fruit jars if the rubbers are dropped 
inside and the cover screwed down, the rubbers will be 
just as good the next season. 

Discoloration on the hands from vegetables or fruit may 
be removed by dipping the hands in very strong tea and 
washing them in warm water.

pounds of sugar to each gallon of juice. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE 

Have thoroughly fresh ripe grapes. Wash, remove skins, 
boil skins and pulp together in a little water till tender. 
Strain through cheese cloth, but do not squeeze. Hang 
up to drip several hours. Measure the juice, put it on to 
boil and as soon as it starts boiling, add half as much 
sugar as there is juice. Boil till sugar dissolves, put into 
jars and seal hot. 

MAKING LEMON FLAVORING No. 1 

Cut the rinds of two lemons in small pieces, put them into 
a four ounce bottle, fill with deodorized strong alcohol 
and let stand in a warm place for one week. Put two 

182 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 183 

drachms fresh oil of lemon, four ounces of deodorized 
strong alcohol and the juice of half a lemon in a large 
bottle and strain into the contents the contents of the 
smaller bottle. 

MAKING LEMON FLAVORING No. 2 

Cover small pieces of fresh lemon peel with brandy in 
tightly covered jars, and use the liquid later for flavoring. 

DRIED LEMON FLAVORING 

Put dried lemon peel through the food chopper two or 
three times, sift, and put the fine powder away for 
flavoring. 

MAKING ORANGE FLAVORING 

Proceed same as in making Lemon Flavoring. 

MAKING VANILLA FLAVORING No. 1 

With one ounce of finely cut fresh vanilla beans, rub two 
ounces of sugar and put in a pint bottle. Pour over this 
four ounces of distilled water and ten ounces of 95% 
deodorized alcohol. Let stand for two weeks in a warm 
place, shaking occasionally. 

MAKING VANILLA FLAVORING No. 2 

Proceed as in making Dried Lemon Flavoring. 
Vanilla should be kept in the dark. 



184 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO CLARIFY VINEGAR OR WINE 

To each gallon of vinegar, pour in one pint or a little 
more, of new milk, and let stand one day. The milk will 
be curdled and caked in the bottom of the jar and all the 
sediment will adhere to it, and the vinegar may be drained 
off perfectly clear. 

WATERMELON VINEGAR 

Take the inside of very ripe watermelons, crush in a stone 
jar, strain the juice into glass jars, cover and set away to 
sour. Makes good vinegar. 

A small button of garlic in a quart of vinegar gives a good 
flavor to salads with which it is used. 



MEMORANDA 



MEMORANDA 



PERSONAL COMFORTS AND THINGS 
GOOD TO KNOW 

GOOD COMPLEXION CREAMS 

Plenty of buttermilk drank each day. 

At least a tablespoonful of olive oil each day. 

Tomatoes eaten daily. 

Onions eaten three times a week. 

Plenty of good drinking water. 

Apples eaten daily. 

CUTS, BURNS, ETC. 

Put a few drops of carbolic acid in the water to wash cuts, 
burns and bruises. 

Never close a cut with court plaster. When necessary to 
cover it to keep out dirt, or to prevent hitting it, fasten 
a soft piece of linen over it. 

AN INSECT IN THE EAR 

Hold a lighted lamp to the ear, and the insect will at once 
come toward it. 

TO REMOVE A SUBSTANCE FROM THE EYE 

To remove a foreign substance from the eye, slice a very 
thin piece from a raw potato, raise the lid and lay the 

185 



186 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

potato on the eyeball. Leave for a little time, remove 
and the substance will be found adhering to the potato. 

A moistened flax-seed may be used in the same manner 
as the potato piece. 

TO PREVENT EYE-GLASSES STEAMING 

Rub both sides of eye-glass lenses with soap or vaseline, 
wipe off with a soft cloth and polish with tissue paper or 
a silk handkerchief, and glasses will not steam in cold 
weather. 

TO REMOVE A FISH BONE FROM THE THROAT 

Swallow a raw oyster or a raw egg. 

BLISTERED HEELS 

If heels are blistered from slipping up and down in low 
shoes, paste four small half circles of velveteen smoothly 
to the side of the heel and the nap of the velveteen will 
prevent the foot slipping. 

Another way to prevent blistered heels from low shoes 
rubbing them, is to stick a strip of adhesive tape around 
the back of the heel at the spot where the shoe rubs. 

HOT CLOTHS 

Hot cloths may be quickly prepared by heating them in a 
steamer, which is easier than wringing them out of hot 
water. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 187 

HOT WATER BAG 

Instead of the rubber bag for hot water, a screw top coffee 
can is a good substitute, as it never leaks, and keeps hot 
all night. Cover it with a washable case of outing 
flannel. 

Another good hot bag is one made of strong muslin with 
a washable cover. Heat clean sand in the oven and fill 
the bag. 

A bag filled with hot salt is also gjod. 

LOCKJAW PRECAUTION 

When a rusty nail or any other metal causes a wound, 
bathe it, and hold it for half an hour or more over a burn- 
ing woolen cloth. A piece of wool may be burned over a 
shovel of coals, or in any other way, just so the smoke 
pours on the wound. 

TO MAKE A MUSTARD PLASTER 

2 teaspoonfuls mustard 2 teaspoonfuls ginger 

2 teaspoonfuls flour water 

Mix the mustard, flour, and ginger with enough water to 
make a paste, and place between two pieces of soft muslin 
and apply. If it burns too much at first, lay on an extra 
piece of muslin and remove it later. 

TO STOP A SIMPLE NOSE BLEED 

Press with the fingers on the upper lip beneath the nostril. 



188 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO EXTRACT A NEEDLE FROM THE FLESH 

Apply a magnet immediately. 

POISONS 

In case of accidental swallowing of poison, mix three tea- 
spoonfuls of mustard with a cupful of warm water and 
swallow as quickly as possible. 

TO REMOVE A SPLINTER 

Fill a wide-mouthed bottle nearly full of hot water, place 
the part containing the splinter over the mouth of the 
bottle and press tightly. The suction will draw the flesh 
down and the steam will remove the splinter. 

LAVENDER SMELLING SALTS 

8 oz. carbonate of ammonia cut y z oz. oil of lavender 
in squares ^ oz. oil of bergamot 

1 fluid ounce oil of cloves J^ oz. oil of cassia 

Put the ammonia into a smelling bottle, mix the oils 
thoroughly and pour just enough into the bottle to cover 
the ammonia, keeping the remainder to replenish the 
smelling bottle. 

TO RELIEVE THIRST WITHOUT WATER 

Keep a dry pebble or button in the mouth. 



BATHROOM AND TOILET 

TO CLEAN COMBS 

Put a few drops of ammonia in a basin of water and let 
the combs remain in it a few minutes, rinse and wipe. 
Combs may also be cleaned in gasoline. 

TO CLEAN A BATHTUB 

Use kerosene, gasoline, or turpentine on an enameled tub. 

FOR THE BATH 

Mix four ounces of alcohol, one-half ounce of ammonia 
and one drachm of oil of lavender, and pour a few drops 
into a bowl of water to perfume and soften it. 

FOR BATH BAGS 

4 Ibs. oatmeal 2 quarts of bran 

l*/2 lb. powdered orrisroot 1 Ib. white castile soap 

iy 2 lb. almond meal 3 oz. violet sachet 

Have the soap dried and powdered, mix all together and 
keep in glass jars from which to fill small cheese cloth 
bags to use as sponges. 

Another pleasing softener and perfume is made with two 
and one-half pounds of fine oatmeal and four ounces of 
powdered orris root. Make cheese cloth bags about four 
inches square, and fill as wanted. 

189 



190 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

Two tablespoonfuls of powdered borax is good to soften 
the water in the bath. 

A few drops of lavender and cologne in the bath are 
pleasing. 

A few drops of camphor seems refreshing in a bath. 

TO CLEAN BRISTLE BRUSHES 

Wash in warm water in which a little baking soda is dis- 
solved, and rinse in warm water and turn bristle side 
down to dry. 

FOR THE HANDS 

Immediately after washing and wiping the hands, dip in 
vinegar and rub together till dry. 

Corn meal used with vinegar is good. 

Lemon juice is fine for removing stains from the hands. 

Putting salt into water for rinsing the hands after clean- 
ing them in soapy water, will be beneficial. 

A little granulated sugar should be kept on the wash- 
stand to dip the fingers in after covering with soap. The 
sugar makes a fine lather and leaves the hands very soft. 
Do not keep much sugar on the stand, as it soon gets 
hard, but add to it as needed. 

Rubbing the hands with a cut tomato once each day will 
remove stains and whiten the hands. 

FOR A DISCOLORED NECK 

Dissolve one teaspoonful of salt in one pint of fresh milk, 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 191 

wash the neck with it at night, let it dry on, and wash 
off with warm water in the morning. 

TO CLEAN A SPONGE 

Rub lemon juice well into it, and rinse in several luke- 
warm waters, to remove a sour smell. 

THE TEETH 

Put a few drops of lemon juice in the water with which 
the teeth are brushed. 

Occasionally brush the teeth with salt. 

TO CLEANSE A TOOTHBRUSH 

Wash toothbrushes occasionally in a strong solution of 
salt and water and dip them, once in a while, in boiling 
water. 

TO MAKE A TOOTH POWDER 

Mix two ounces of precipitated chalk with two ounces of 
powdered orris root, then add twelve drops of eucalyptus 
and mix again. 



THE HAIR 

A DRY SHAMPOO 

Sift yellow corn meal till fine, and rub into the hair, brush 
thoroughly, and repeat. 

AN EGG SHAMPOO 

Beat two eggs, add the juice of a lemon, rub thoroughly 
through the hair, and rinse in several warm waters. Dry 
in sun and air. 

Rub dry salt into the hair at night, wear a night cap, and 
brush out all the salt in the morning, to make the hair 
lustrous. 

Washing hair in warm salt water is very good if not done 
too often. Always dry in sun and air. 

A GOOD SHAMPOO 

Lay a cake of Ivory soap in a pitcher, pour over it a pint 
of boiling water, and stir till there's a good lather. Add 
one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, wash the hair and 
scalp thoroughly and rinse in several warm waters. 

A SHAMPOO FOR AUBURN HAIR 

Put five cents worth of Salts of Tartar in a pint of warm 
water, rub into the hair, making a fine lather. Leave it a 
short time, and rinse in several warm waters. 

192 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 193 

WASHING BLOND HAIR 

After shampooing blond hair, to the last rinsing water, 
add the juice of half a lemon strained through a cloth. 
Dry in sun and air. 

TO KEEP HAIR IN CURL 

Put the white of an egg in a cup, beat to a froth, and fill 
the cup with rain water. Apply this to the hair, and roll 
on clean strips of old stockings and tie in bow knots. 

TO REMOVE TANGLES 
Put a little alcohol on the tangle. 



GLOVES, PARASOLS, ETC. 

TO MEND GLOVES 

Sew over and over on the wrong- side with cotton thread, 
or place court plaster of the same color on the underpart, 
smoothing till dry. 

TO PRESERVE NEW GLOVES 

Wrap in paraffin paper to prevent fading. 

TO FRESHEN BLACK KID GLOVES 

Cover with ink and polish with a soft cloth when dry. 

TO CLEAN CHAMOIS LEATHER 

Wash in a weak solution of soda and warm water. Soap 
the chamois skin with Ivory soap and soak it in the soda 
water for two hours. Rub it softly till clean, rinse in two 
soapy waters (not clear water), wring in a rough towel, 
dry in the air, and when nearly dry, pull carefully into 
shape. 

TO FRESHEN SUEDE KID 

Rub with a piece of emery paper. 

TO DRY-CLEAN WHITE GLOVES 

Lay the gloves on a table, rub into them Fuller's earth 
and powdered alum mixed in equal quantities, rub well, 

194 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 195 

then brush well, and sprinkle with dry bran and whiten- 
ing. Leave 'on a short time, then shake. 

TO WASH WHITE SILK GLOVES 

Wash at night with Ivory soap suds. Rinse well and let 
dry in the dark to prevent turning yellow. 

TO CLEAN WHITE KID GLOVES 

Put on the hands and proceed to wash them as though 
washing the hands in a bowl of gasoline. When clean, 
wipe dry on a clean white flannel or towel. Remove and 
hang out to air. Use gasoline out of doors. 

TO CLEAN A WHITE PARASOL 

Put in a tub of warm Ivory soap suds, and scrub inside 
and out, carefully, with a small scrubbing brush. Rinse 
well, and dry open, out of doors in the sun. If the para- 
sol is white silk, dry in the shade. 

TO CLEAN KHAKI TROUSERS 

Use warm water, soap, and a scrubbing brush. 



SHOES AND RUBBERS 

TO BLACKEN SHOES 

Use a discarded tooth brush to apply paste blacking. A 
few drops of paraffin added to shoe blacking will impart 
a good polish to damp shoes, and help preserve the 
leather. 

TO CLEAN PATENT LEATHERS 

Clean with olive oil, then polish briskly with a soft woolen 
cloth. 

Wipe off dust and dirt, clean with sweet milk, leaving 
the milk on for a few minutes, then wipe with a soft 
cloth. 

Wipe the patent leather to remove dust, then wipe with 
olive oil and polish with a soft cloth. 

CLEANING TAN SHOES 

Rub with the inside of a banana peel, then wipe dry with 
a soft cloth. 

A flannel cloth dipped in turpentine cleans tan leather. 

CLEANING WHITE CANVAS SHOES 

Use a preparation purchased at the stores where the shoes 
are sold. It is much more convenient to use and costs 
no more than preparations made at home. 

196 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 197 

CLEANING WHITE KID SHOES 

Dip a clean white flannel in benzine and rub the kid, 
dipping frequently into the benzine and rubbing quickly, 
then rub with a dry flannel. 

A piece of Art Gum is also good for cleaning kid, but if 
badly soiled, plenty of benzine or gasoline is better. 

FOR CREAKY SHOES 

Have a cobbler drive a couple of small wooden pegs into 
the soles. 

CARE OF NEW SHOES 

If allowed to stand over night in a pan with enough olive 
oil to cover the soles, they will last longer, and never 
creak. 

Rub new shoes with a slice of raw potato, and they will 
polish as easily as old ones. 

Coat the soles of new shoes with three or four coats of 
copal varnish and they will seldom need resoling. 

Rub new shoes occasionally with vaseline to prolong 
their wearing qualities. 

If the soles of shoes are oiled with a little vaseline about 
twice each month, and let dry over night, rubbers will 
seldom be needed to keep out dampness. 

Wet shoes should be stuffed with paper to absorb the 
moisture and prevent the leather getting hard. 



198 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

INNER SOLES 

Inner soles for shoes may be cut from old felt hats. Soles 
for bedroom slippers may be cut from old felt hats and 
glued to the ordinary sole, or bound and sewed to a soft 
top shoe. 

SHOE LACES 

If shoe laces are slightly waxed, they will not come 
undone. 

Tie a shoe lace bow as usual, and before pulling the 
loops tight, slip a second loop through the center and 
tighten. This will never slip. 

TO SAVE RUBBERS 

Cut a heel shaped piece out of an old rubber and glue in 
the heel of the new one. 

Always mark your initials inside your rubbers. 

To varnish rubbers helps looks and wearing qualities. 

When heels of rubbers are worn out, cut them into strap 
or toe rubbers. 

Turn rubbers wrong side out to wash, and they will dry 
without rotting. 



HATS, FEATHERS, RIBBONS AND 
LACES 

TO CLEAN FELT HATS 

Rub corn meal carefully into the felt, and remove with a 
soft brush. 

Or scrub with corn meal and gasoline. 

The inner part of a stale loaf of white bread rubbed into 
the felt is sometimes very successful in cleaning. 

Rub the entire hat with fine sandpaper and it leaves the 
hat like new. 

To dust a felt hat, use a piece of velveteen. 
TO CLEAN STRAW HATS 
Clean a black chip hat with a soft cloth dipped in alcohol. 

To restore the color, use one-half pint hot water with one 
teaspoonful of ammonia. Cover the hat with a cloth wet in 
this mixture, let stand a few minutes, then place a warm 
iron over the cloth, and press into shape. 

TO FRESHEN BLACK STRAW HATS 

Mix one ounce of black sealing wax and one-half pint of 
alcohol. Leave the bottle in a warm place till the con- 
tents are creamy, shake the bottle well, and brush over 
the hat. 

TO CLEAN WHITE STRAW HATS 

Mix corn meal and gasoline, and scrub with a small scrub 
brush. Apply till clean, and brush dry. 

199 



200 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

Another method is to make a paste of sulphur and lemon 
juice and scrub the hat with it, rinsing in clear water, 
very quickly. 

And still another way is to pour peroxide of hydrogen on 
the hat and brush it with a small scrub brush. Repeat 
till clean, shape the hat, and dry in the sun. 

TO CLEAN AND FRESHEN CHIFFON HATS 

Mix equal parts of magnesia, French chalk and pulverized 
soap, sprinkle thickly on the hat, leave for a day, and 
brush off. 

If a chiffon or flower hat is caught in a heavy shower, 
shake it well and suspend it bottom side up in some con- 
venient place to dry. It will rev-ive like new. 

Any lace or flower or other hat may be dipped in gasoline 
entirely, and cleaned thoroughly. Always be careful to 
use gasoline out of doors. 

TO CLEAN FEATHERS 

Put one cupful of corn meal, one-half cupful of white flour 
and three tablespoonfuls of powdered borax into a paper 
bag and shake the feathers in this till clean, then remove 
and shake. This also cleans laces, etc. 

Feathers are also cleaned by dipping in gasoline, rubbing 
the feathers toward the tip, then shaking dry. This does 
not take out the curl. Never use gasoline indoors. 

TO CLEAN WHITE FEATHERS 
Make a paste of flour and gasoline. Put the feather in it 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 201 

and rub carefully the entire length, toward the tip. Re- 
peat till clean. Rinse in clear gasoline and shake dry. 

TO CLEAN RIBBONS 

"Wash ribbons" washed in warm soapy water, squeezed 
as dry as possible, smoothed, placed on an ironing board 
and held down with a warm flat iron in one hand while 
the other hand pulls the ribbon quickly under the iron till 
it is dry, will be like new. 

This is good for cleaning ribbons. Dip in lukewarm 
water, spread on a table and scrub with a brush rubbed 
in Ivory soap. Rinse in clean warm water and press be- 
tween folds of thin cloth. 

TO WASH DELICATE RIBBONS 

Immerse in salt and water, and dissolve shavings of Ivory 
soap in boiling water till like jelly when cooled slightly. 
To a little of this jelly, add warm water to form a good 
suds, add a pinch of borax, put the ribbon in and squeeze 
back and forth through the hands till clean. Then rinse 
in warm, then in cold water, roll smoothly in a towel and 
in about two hours, press between paper. 

Gasoline is fine for cleaning ribbons. Do not use gaso- 
line indoors. 

Ribbons and silk may be scrubbed with Ivory soap and 
gasoline, rinsing in clean gasoline. 

TO STIFFEN RIBBONS 

Put a teaspoonful of sugar in a cupful of water and rinse 



202 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

ribbons, and when pressed between paper, they are like 
new. 

TO CLEAN WHITE WINGS 

Make a paste of naphtha and French chalk, letting it dry 
on the wings and remain for a day, then, brush. 

Ordinary white wings may be scrubbed with a small 
scrubbing brush and Ivory soap suds. Scrub in the direc- 
tion the wings grow, rinse well and while drying, brush 
frequently. 

TO CURL OSTRICH FEATHERS 

Sprinkle salt over hot coals, and shake the feathers over 
them. 

Or place the plume in a warm oven for a few minutes. 

TO COLOR FLOWERS 

Squeeze a little oil paint of the desired color into a cup. 
Pour in a little gasoline, and mix it with a stiff brush 
(about one-half inch in width) with the paint. Add 
gasoline a little at a time till the right shade is reached. 
Try a leaf in it, dipping in, then shaking dry. Drying 
makes the color several shades lighter. Ribbons, laces, 
gloves, etc., may be tinted in this manner. 

TO PREVENT SILK FROM CRACKING 

Press with a hot iron. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 203 

TO CLEAN BLACK SILK 

Brush black taffeta with a piece of velveteen, pin it 
smoothly to the ironing board and sponge with one 
tablespoonful of ammonia in two quarts of strong black 
coffee. Sponge both sides and rub dry with a clean soft 
cloth. An old soft stocking makes a good sponging cloth. 
Equal parts of ox gall and boiling water are also good 
for sponging black silk. 

Another sponging liquid is one teaspoonful of ammonia 
in a cupful of strong tea. 

TO REMOVE BEESWAX FROM SILK 

Put the spotted places between clean white blotting 
paper, and press with a quite warm iron, changing the 
blotters as the wax is absorbed. 

Grease spots are often removed in the same manner. 

TO WASH PONGEE SILK 

Wash in lukewarm Ivory soap suds, rinse in warm 
water, hang* on the line and let drip dry, and press on 
the wrong side without dampening. Pongee sometimes 
shrinks when wet. 

TO FRESHEN VELVET 

Spread a cloth wrung from cold water on top of a not 
too hot range, or over an inverted flat iron, spread the 
velvet over it and brush lightly with a whisk broom. 
Velvet can be made to look like new. 



204 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO CLEAN WHITE SATIN 

To dry-clean white satin, use dried bread crumbs finely 
sifted, mixed with an equal quantity of pulverized blue. 
Spread over the satin, let remain an hour or two, and 
brush off with a piece of soft clean linen. If gold or silver 
trimmings are on the satin, use a piece of clean white 
velveteen for brushing. 

TO WASH WHITE SATIN 

Use Ivory soap suds in lukewarm water, rinse in luke- 
warm water, and press on the wrong side. 

Silks, satins and velvets may often be cleaned by using 
gasoline and corn meal, cleaning a small space at a time 
and rubbing with a soft clean cloth. By adding little salt, 
the gasoline will never leave a mark around edges. 

TO CLEAN SILK GOWNS 

Grate a large raw potato to each quart of soft water nec- 
essary to wash the dress. Cover the potatoes well with 
cold water, let stand two days without moving, pour off 
the clear water carefully into the tub or large pail in 
which the dress is to be washed, and dip the pieces up 
and down till clean. Do not wring, but hang out to drip 
nearly dry, when the pieces should be laid flat and wiped 
on both sides, and pressed between soft cloths or paper. 

TO WASH LACES 

Fine laces, handkerchiefs, doilies or trimmings, may be 
made like new by soaking them in lukewarm Ivory soap 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 205 

suds for a couple of hours, changing the water and re- 
peating till clean. Squeeze them very gently, rinse in 
several warm waters and while quite wet (do not squeeze), 
pat them carefully in shape on a flat smooth surface to 
dry. Place them right side up and they will look exactly 
like new, and it is very easy to spread each tiny figure 
into shape when it is quite wet. A large piece of marble 
or glass, the bottom of a large platter, or the bottom of a 
flat porcelain bath tub is good to dry them on. Thin 
laces may be dried on the window pane, but heavier lace 
will not stay on the glass. Lace yokes are beautifully 
done in this manner. 

TO DRY-CLEAN LACES 

Rub block magnesia or corn starch carefully into the lace, 
roll or fold and lay away for several days, when the 
powder may be shaken out. If not perfectly clean, repeat. 
Flat pieces of lace may be laid over a piece of white paper 
that is covered with block magnesia, the lace itself also 
well covered, another sheet of white paper laid on the lace 
and a heavy flat weight, like a large book, placed on top 
and left to press the lace for several days. Shake, or 
brush carefully with a soft brush. 

TO CLEAN LACE YOKES 

Sprinkle boric acid on a lace yoke, lay away for a couple 
of days, shake well, and the yoke will be clean without re- 
moving it from the waist. 

TO CLEAN LACE WAISTS 

Put a delicate lace waist into a two quart glass jar filled 



206 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

with gasoline with the top tightly screwed on, and let 
stand over night. Next morning pour out a little of the 
gasoline, shake the jar thoroughly, remove the waist, and 
shake carefully dry. If the gasoline is much soiled, rinse 
in clean gasoline. And do not use gasoline indoors. 

TO DRY-CLEAN LACE WAISTS 

Put a lace waist in a pillow case, cover thickly with corn 
meal and flour mixed, leave for several days, take out of 
doors and shake well but carefully in the bag. Then re- 
move and shake free from the flour and corn meal. 

TO WASH LACE WAISTS 

Shake the dust from a washable lace waist, immerse it in 
clean warm water, with a tablespoonful of ammonia 
stirred in, then lay it in a wash bowl, cover it with strong 
Ivory soap suds and set in the sun for three hours. Do 
not rub, but dip up and down, rinse well in several warm 
waters, starch if desired, and press on the wrong side, 
on a padded ironing board. 

TO COLOR LACES 

Proceed in same manner as To Color Flowers. 

TO CLEAN VEILS 

Put the veil into a glass fruit jar, filled with wood alco- 
hol, screw the top tightly on, and leave for about ten 
minutes. Then pour out a little of the alcohol, replace 
the top and shake the jar thoroughly. Squeeze the veil 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 207 

carefully, and shake partly dry (out of doors), then pin 
over a sheet on a bed or table, to dry in shape. Do not 
use alcohol near fire. 

TO WASH VEILS 

Dip the veil into a warm suds of Ivory soap, squeeze it 
carefully till clean, rinse in several warm waters, and 
pin on a sheet on a bed or table till partly dry, then press 
under a cloth with a warm iron. 

TO FRESHEN BLACK VEILS 

Stir a dessertspoonful of ammonia into a quart fruit jar 
nearly filled with alcohol, put a black veil in, cover 
tightly, and shake thoroughly. Remove from the jar, 
squeeze carefully, shake till nearly dry, pin on a sheet on 
a bed or table, and leave till perfectly dry. 

TO FRESHEN BLACK LACE 

Spread the lace on a flat surface, brush carefully with a 
soft brush, and shake out the dust. Mix in a saucepan 
one dessertspoonful of dry tea, one pint of boiling water 
and one teaspoonful of gum arabic. Simmer slowly, 
stirring till the gum is dissolved. Strain into a dish and 
soak the lace in it for thirty minutes. If the lace is silk, 
add a teaspoonful of alcohol to the solution. After soak- 
ing, squeeze the lace carefully, then put it in folds of cloth 
and squeeze. Then smooth it in shape, roll carefully in 
a dry cloth, let remain an hour and press over paper on a 
padded ironing board, with a paper on top of the lace 
which must be pressed on the wrong side. 



208 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO STIFFEN LACE 

Put a pinch of sugar in the last rinsing water. 

TO CLEAN A BLACK WOOL GOWN 

Sponge with ammonia and warm water, a tablespoonful 
of ammonia to a quart of water. Rub powdered French 
chalk into the spots, leave for half a day, cover the chalk 
with clean white blotting paper and set a warm iron on it. 
Then sponge again with ammonia and water, and press 
carefully under a cloth, on the wrong side where possible. 

TO WASH A BLACK WOOL GOWN 

Boil one ounce of soap bark solution in one quart of water. 
When thoroughly steeped, strain, and add to two gallons 
of hot water. Put the dress in this and dip up and down till 
clean. Rinse in warm water, squeeze carefully, shake out 
doors and let drip partially dry. Shake again, hang up 
again and when nearly dry, press carefully on the wrong 
side. 

TO CLEAN COVERT CLOTH 

Mix six ounces of water, one ounce of sulphuric ether and 
one ounce of ammonia. Sponge covert cloth with the 
mixture, then sponge with warm water, cover with a damp 
cloth and press dry, pressing on the wrong side where 
possible. 

TO CLEAN SPOTS FROM CASHMERE 

Make a paste of Fuller's earth and cold water, and put on 
the spots and leave for several hours, then brush. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 209 

TO CLEAN MACINTOSH COATS 

Dissolve a handful of the best gray lime in half a pail of 
water, and apply to the coat, with a sponge. Repeat, after 
three hours. 

TO REMOVE GLOSS FROM CLOTHING 

Rub carefully with fine emery cloth. After using emery 
cloth on very smooth surfaces, rub carefully the way of 
the nap with a warm silk handkerchief. 

Sponging with hot vinegar is good for removing shine 
from woolen garments. 

Black wool may be sponged with borax and water, then 
with clear water, to remove gloss. 

TO DRY-CLEAN WHITE CLOTH 

Rub pipe clay into the soiled places, leave for a few hours, 
or a day or two, then brush off the pipe clay with a 
small scrubbing brush kept for the purpose. 

TO CLEAN WHITE FUR CLOTH 

Brush the cloth the way of the nap, shake, dip a clean 
sponge in alcohol and wash thoroughly in the direction 
the nap goes. Have mixed one part powdered borax and 
three parts powdered starch, and sprinkle on while the 
cloth is wet, all it will hold. Leave in a clean place for 
three days, then brush out all the starch. 

TO WASH WHITE SWEATERS AND SHAWLS 

Use a tablespoonful of Pearline to each pailful of warm 



210 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

water. Cover the garment with this, press down with the 
hands to squeeze out the dirty water. Let soak thirty min- 
utes, pour off the water and repeat till clean. Rinse in 
several clean warm waters, but do not lift from the tub 
or bucket the garment is washed in. Take out of doors, 
pour off all the water possible. Squeeze the garment into 
a bunch in the two hands and dump quickly on a dry 
sheet on the grass in the hot sun. Spread the garment 
in shape and let dry. It will be perfect. If the sun is not 
hot enough to dry it on the grass, the garment may be 
spread on a sheet stretched on quilting or curtain frames 
across boxes or chairs.

REMOVING STAINS 

TO REMOVE BLOOD STAINS FROM COTTON 

To remove blood stains from cotton, wet the spots with 
cold water, sprinkle with salt and rub lightly. 

Or soak the material in salt and water, afterwards wash- 
ing in soap and water. 

A spot on a starched garment may be removed by apply- 
ing a thick paste of corn starch and cold water. 

TO REMOVE BLOOD STAINS FROM SILK 

Use strong cold borax water. 

TO REMOVE CHOCOLATE AND COCOA STAINS 

Wash first in cold, then pour boiling water through the 
stains. 

TO REMOVE COFFEE STAINS 

Spread the stained part over a basin, rub in powdered 
borax and pour boiling water through, and let soak. 

TO REMOVE FRUIT STAINS 

Spread the stained part over a basin, and pour boiling 
water through, let soak for thirty minutes and launder 
as usual. Let dry in the sun. 

Another method is to moisten the spots with camphor 
before wetting with water, then launder as usual. 

211 



212 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 
TO REMOVE GRASS STAINS 

Rub the stain with molasses, laundering as usual, after- 
ward. Another way is to saturate the spot with kero- 
sene, and launder. Alcohol will remove grass stains in 
materials that will not launder. 

TO REMOVE CANDLE GREASE 

Use gasoline on a soft cloth. 

TO REMOVE AXLE GREASE 

To remove axle grease on washable garments, cover 
thickly with butter, let stand a few minutes, wash in 
gasoline, and then in soap and water. 

Grease may be removed from overalls by putting them in 
cold water, with plenty of soap, and as soon as the water 
boils, add about three tablespoonfuls of kerosene and 
boil a few minutes. Do not pour kerosene from a kero- 
sene can near a fire, but pour it from a can into a dipper 
away from fire, and then pour from the dipper quickly 
into the boiler. 

Chloroform will remove grease from the most delicate 
fabrics, but it is apt to leave a mark and for that reason, 
ether is more universally used. 

French chalk put around the edge of a spot before clean- 
ing with gasoline on cloth, will prevent a mark from 
showing. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 213 

TO REMOVE INDELIBLE INK OR PENCIL 
MARKS 

Dampen the spot with water, and rub with the head of a 
common match. 

TO REMOVE INK STAINS 

Cover the ink stain on any fabric with Hydrogen Perox- 
ide, lay in the sun and air, and repeat till the stain dis- 
appears. 

Ink may be removed from wash goods by melting a piece 
of tallow, putting the spot in the hot tallow and washing 
as usual. On colored garments that will not wash, drop 
melted tallow and scrape off with a knife. If the stain 
does not all come out, put a clean piece of blotting paper 
over it, and press with a hot iron. 

TO REMOVE INK FROM WOODEN FLOORS 

Use lemon juice and salt, without soap. 

TO REMOVE RED INK 

Use ammonia and water. 

TO REMOVE IODINE STAINS 

Cover the stain on cloth as soon as possible with a paste 
of corn starch and water. Change for fresh paste and 
repeat till stain disappears. 

If the stain is on wood, apply the paste, let stand a few 
minutes, and rub with a soft cloth. 



214 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO REMOVE IRON RUST FROM WASH GOODS 

Wet the spot with lemon juice, sprinkle with salt, and 
hold over boiling water so the steam can go through. 
If very badly rusted, add three tablespoonfuls of cream 
of tartar to three gallons of water, and boil the stained 
garments in it for about one hour. 

Another way is to boil pie plant in enough water to soak 
the dress, remove the pie plant and soak the dress in the 
water for some time, then wash as usual. 

TO REMOVE LEMON JUICE STAINS 

Mix one tablespoonful of ammonia in four tablespoonfuls 
of water, and sponge lightly. 

TO REMOVE MACHINE OIL 

Apply kerosene to the spots, and launder as usual. 

Cover an oil spot on silk with block magnesia shaved in 
fine powder. Leave on for a time, shake off, and repeat 
if necessary. 

TO REMOVE MILDEW 

Cover the mildew on wash goods with molasses, then 

launder as usual. 

Or soak the stains in buttermilk several hours, then wash. 

TO REMOVE MILK STAINS 

Wash first in cold, then hot water. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 215 

Apply absorbent cotton at once when milk is spilled on 

woolens. 

Alcohol will remove milk on colored garments. 



TO REMOVE MUD STAINS FROM CLOTH 

Use water in which a sliced raw potato has soaked. 

TO REMOVE PAINT 

Rub turpentine thoroughly into the material. If the 
paint is very dry, mix a little ammonia with the turpen- 
tine. Keep all cleaning fluids away from fire. 

Ether is also good for removing paint. 

TO REMOVE PERSPIRATION STAINS 

To remove perspiration stains from white waists, soak 
the stained part in baking soda and cold water. Repeat, 
if necessary, after thirty minutes. 

For silk waists, sponge the spot carefully with a little 
cold water, and cover with powdered prepared chalk. 
When thoroughly dry, brush carefully with a soft brush. 

To remove perspiration stains on white cotton from wear- 
ing black silk, boil the garment in one-half gallon of 
water containing a handful of peach leaves. 

TO REMOVE SCORCH STAINS 

Apply Peroxide of Hydrogen. 



216 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO REMOVE TEA STAINS 

Wash in cold, and then pour boiling water through the 
spot. Soak an obstinate tea stain in glycerine. 

TO REMOVE VARNISH STAINS 

Saturate in gasoline, then wash in cold water with naph- 
tha soap. 

TO REMOVE VINEGAR STAINS 

Mix one tablespoonful of ammonia in four tablespoonfuls 
of water and sponge lightly. 

TO REMOVE WINE STAINS 

Moisten a red wine stain in cold water and keep covered 
with salt, and the wet salt will absorb the stain. 

Wash yellow wine stains in cold water, then in warm 
suds. 



FURS 

STORING FURS 

Beat the furs well but carefully, out-of-doors and hang, 
if convenient, on a line in the sun for an hour or more. 
Then lay in a box lined with newspapers, putting paper 
between parts of the furs that must lap over one another. 
Wrap the box in newspapers, putting a heavy express 
paper over all, sticking all edges of this last paper with 
mucilage. 



CLEANING BLACK LYNX 

Clean it with a stiff brush dipped in a solution of am- 
monia and water. 



TO CLEAN CHINCHILLA 

Make a paste of prepared chalk and water, put on the fur 
with a wide brush and let dry. Beat the fur lightly to 
remove the chalk. 

If chinchilla fur gets wet, suspend it near heat, beating 
it lightly every few minutes. Harder furs require stiff 
brushes to smooth them, always stroking in the direction 
the fur lies. 

If furs get wet, absorb all possible moist-ire by applying 
hot towels, before hanging to dry. 

217 



218 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

TO CLEAN ERMINE 

Smooth starch with water till like paste. Dip a piece of 
clean white flannel in this paste, rub the furs well with it 
and leave near fire to dry. Then brush it with a stiff 
brush, and shake thoroughly to remove the flour. 

TO CLEAN MINK 
Brush thoroughly with dry corn meal. 

TO CLEAN SEALSKIN 

Spread sawdust over sealskin and spray benzine over the 
sawdust. When nearly dry, brush off with a whisk broom, 
then brush so the hair stands up, and let it air. 

TO CLEAN WHITE FUR 

Lay the fur flat on a table, take a clean white cloth and 
rub dampened corn meal into the fur, always rubbing the 
way the fur lies. Rub carefully till the fur is filled. Shake, 
and if not clean, repeat the operation, using plenty of 
dry corn meal to dry it at the last. 

White fur may be cleaned by rubbing in a paste of corn 
meal and gasoline, repeating, if the fur is badly soiled. 
Shake well, and air. Clean all things out-of-doors when 
using gasoline. 



DISINFECTANTS, SCENTS, ETC. 

Essence of cinnamon evaporating in a shallow dish is an 
agreeable disinfectant. 

A little charcoal mixed with water thrown in a sink will 
deodorize it. 

A small piece of charcoal should be placed inside the 
refrigerator to insure a sweet interior. It should also 
be placed in dark closets. Renew every week or two. 

Put a piece of camphor gum in a saucer and apply a hot 
poker. 

Put a few pieces of dried orange peel on a hot stove, or 
in an old tin can or shovel, and allow it to smoulder. 

Broken pieces of pumice stone may be saturated with oil 
of lavender to create a pleasant odor in a room. Or a 
few drops of the oil may be dropped into a bowl of boil- 
ing water, letting it stand till cold. 

Eau-de-cologne may be burned in an old iron spoon 
made red hot ; or it may be poured over block ammonia 
placed in an earthen jar. 

A little oil of sandalwood dropped on a hot shovel will 
impart a delightful fragrance to a room. 

The odor of paint, and of tobacco smoke in a room may 
be dispelled by setting a dish of cold water in the room. 

A dish of ground roasted coffee is one of the best pre- 
servatives to leave in cellar. 



219 



220 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

LIME WATER 

Put a piece of unslacked lime the size of an egg in an 
earthen vessel, pouring over it a quart of cold water. 
Allow it to stand a few hours, then filter it through clean 
white blotting paper. Pour it into a clean bottle, cork 
and keep in a cool dark place. A teaspoonful of lime 
water in a cupful of milk or water, almost destroys any 
deleterious substance there. It gives no unpleasant taste. 

SCENTING LINENS 

Underlinen is delightfully scented by placing broken 
orris root in the bureau drawers and hanging in small 
muslin bags in the closets. 

A few drops of any preferred scent put on broken pumice 
stone and scattered through drawers and boxes, gives a 
delicious perfume. 

Sachet powder mixed with powdered orris root in equal 
parts, preserves the fragrance much longer than by using 
sachet powder alone. 

Pack away bed linen with leaves of dried rosemary or 
sweet lavender.

stone jar, then add a layer of salt; spread thickly over 
this stick cinnamon and whole cloves ; pour over these a 
pint of alcohol, cover and allow to remain one week, then 
mix and fill into rose jar. 



PESTS OF VARIOUS KINDS 

ANTS 

J4 cupful water 1 teaspoonful sugar 

1 teaspoonful tartar emetic 

Mix and place where ants congregate. 

Wash a large sponge, press dry, then sprinkle with fine 
sugar and place where ants are thick. They will fill the 
sponge, which may be dropped in boiling water, squeezed 
out, and placed ready for them again. 

A small cloth saturated with oil of sassafras will cause 
ants to leave. 

RED ANTS 

Several ways of getting rid of red ants are good. Use 
whichever is easiest for you in your locality. 

The sponge remedy given for ants is good. 

1 teaspoonful paregoric with one-fourth cupful water is 
effective when sprinkled around. 

Sugar well mixed with pulverized plaster of paris 
sprinkled about will drive them away. 

Sprigs of fresh parsley laid around food will cause ants 
to disappear. 

RATS AND MICE 

Put sprays of peppermint or peppermint essence where 
mice have been, and they will not return. 

222 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 223 

Or stuff pieces of sponge in holes where they enter. 

Sprinkle sulphur about house and barn where rats come 
in, and they will be driven away. 

To stuff the holes where they enter with soap sprinkled 
with cayenne pepper, will keep them out. 

FLIES 

Mix one-half teaspoonful black pepper and one teaspoon- 
ful of sugar in one teaspoonful cream and put on a plate, 
and flies will disappear. 

Two teaspoonfuls formaldehyde in. two cupfuls of water 
poured into shallow dishes and set around tables where 
flies are troublesome, will destroy them. 

A little bit of sassafras on a small cloth laid in an old 
baking powder or other can cover, will drive flies away. 

Flies dislike mignonette, and they despise hop vines. 

ROACHES 

Cucumber peel scattered around the haunts of roaches 
and left over night, gets rid of the bugs. 

Mix a dough of corn meal and strong borax solution, 
shape into little cakes and place on pantry shelves to feed 
roaches so they will refuse to return. 

A weak solution of turpentine might be poured down 
water pipes once a week to keep water bugs away. 

SPARROWS 

A little molasses put on their roosting places causes them 
to leave. 



224 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

MOTHS 

Blotting paper saturated with turpentine placed where 
moths are apt to work, will prevent their havoc. 

Sassafras bark scattered among woolens and furs is a 
preventive of moths. 

Saturate an old sheet with formaldehyde and hang in the 
closet containing moths, first stopping all possible cracks 
and keyhole, and leaving there for a day. 

If moths get into carpets, draperies and furniture, use the 
just given formaldehyde cure. 

Where moths are apt to injure carpets, boil a few camphor 
balls in water and sweep with a clean broom, dipping 
frequently in the mixture. 

Or scatter powdered borax plentifully about. 

An effective, quick way to rid carpets and furniture of 
moths, is to use an oil atomizer and spray them with one 
teaspoonful carbolic acid, mixed in one quart benzine. 

SCENT BAGS TO HANG IN CLOSETS 

*/4 oz. ground cloves */ 2 Ib. lavender flowers 

54 oz. caraway seed y 2 oz. dried thyme 

1 oz. dry salt y z oz. dried mint 

Mix well and put in small bags in closets and among 
clothes. This mixture is said to be a preventive of moths. 



FLOWERS, PLANTS AND GREEN 
THINGS 

Add a little salt, saltpeter or soda to the water contain- 
ing cut flowers, or place them in cold soap suds, to aid 
in their preservation. 

Another way is to fill a vase nearly full of fresh bits of 
charcoal, adding water till the vase is nearly full of water, 
place flowers in it, and change water daily. 
Cut flowers with a sharp knife instead of scissors, if you 
wish them to keep for a longer time. 

NASTURTIUMS 

After picking, put them in rather hot water and the stems 
soon become stiff, so the blooms will stay up. 
By tying a soft thread around buds, they may be kept 
from opening for several days. 

A FLOWER CENTER PIECE 

Cover any size embroidery hoop with mosquito netting, 
placing over a low bowl, and stick short stemmed flowers 
through it. 

A GROWING CENTER PIECE 

Plant a five cent package of old fashioned portulaca seed 
in your fern dish for beautiful greenery. 

A flower pot may be covered with a straw sleeve pro- 
tector or made attractive by decorating in green oil paints 
in leaf designs. 

225 



226 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

GROWING GREENS 

Mix mustard and turnip seed and sow thickly in odd spots 
in garden or yard. They grow rapidly, can be cut off 
and will grow again. Horse radish is also good to have 
growing. 

MINT 

Grow fresh mint for cooking, in less than a week in a glass 
jar of water. Do not change, but add to the water each 
day or two, and keep the sprays short by pinching off the 
tops. 

VINES 

Vines should be trained on a strong black thread in a 
window garden. 

A sweet potato, not kiln dried, placed in a bowl contain- 
ing a few inches of water, will grow beautiful greens. 

TO HASTEN GROWTH 

Thoroughly dissolve one tablespoonful epsom salts in one 
half gallon cool water, and pour over plant roots. 

FLOWERS FOR WINTER 

Save the most perfect buds of the desired flowers, cut 
with a three inch stem and cover the end immediately with 
sealing wax. When they have shrunken some, wrap each 
one in a piece of paper and keep in a dry box. When 
ready for them in winter, take them at night, cut off the 
ends, and place in water containing a little niter of salt. 
The following day the flowers will bloom as though just 
picked. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 227 

PRESERVING FOR DECORATION 

Gather red berries like pods of roses, and bright red 
berries and dip in melted paraffin for decorating in winter. 

HYACINTHS 

Plant four or five bulbs in October in a six inch pot, and 
place in the cellar till six weeks before Christmas, then 
bring gradually to the light. If about to bloom too soon, 
put in a darker cooler place ; if too slow, put in a warmer 
lighter place. 

TO KEEP CYCLAMEN BLOOMING 

Do not cast it aside after repeated blooming, but in the 
spring, dig a hole in the ground, set the pot in and water 
as usual. In the fall, place it in a sunny window, keep 
moist with warm water and it will bloom like new. 

TO ROOT OLEANDERS 

Cut off a strong slip, cut a slot in the end and fill full of 
cotton, wrapping paper around it so it will not touch the 
bottle, and put it in a bottle of water in a dark place for 
a week. It should have plenty of roots by that time, 
and is ready to plant carefully in rich soil. 

Other woody plants may be rooted in this way. 

SLIPPING GERANIUMS 

Insert an oat or a grain of rye in the bottom of the slip, 
put in a pot, keep moist, and the result is wonderful. 



228 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

FERNS AND PALMS 

Do not place ferns on windows or in a draft. 

Moisten the soil around them each week with not too 
strong cold tea. 

When the fronds droop, the fern is usually root-bound. 

Two tablespoonfuls of olive or castor oil poured on the 
roots of large ferns and palms once a month, does 
wonders. Use less quantities for smaller plants. 

PALMS 

Keep palms washed clean with luke warm water and 
milk and give them from one to two tablespoonfuls olive 
or castor oil, according to their size, once a month. 

A fresh green pineapple top may be planted and grown 
into a fine palm. 

RUBBER PLANTS 

Give them oil as advised for ferns and palms. If the 
leaves become spotted, turn yellow and drop, give the 
roots some sweet skim milk once or twice each week. 

FROZEN POTTED PLANTS 

Turn boxes or other covers immediately over them, 
covering them with blankets, papers, or anything to en- 
tirely keep out light; or set them in a perfectly dark 
closet to thaw naturally, without light. Bulbs frozen in 
water should be set away from a ray of light and brought 
out on a milder day. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 22!) 

TO KILL BURDOCKS 

Cut off close to the ground and drop a few drops of gaso- 
line from an old kerosene can on the roots. 

PLANT BUGS 

One teaspoonful ammonia to one quart warm water on 
roots of plants destroys worms and bugs. 

To rid plants of lice, spray with two tablespoonfuls oil of 
sassafras well stirred in one quart of lukewarm water. 

TO SHARPEN LAWN MOWERS 

Spread a mixture of emery dust and black oil as thick as 
molasses, on the concave cutter bar beneath the knives. 
Remove the cast head covering on the outside of one 
wheel and place a crank on the end of the axle, and turn 
backward. This turns the knife cylinder rapidly and 
draws the knife edges through the emery and oil. The 
kitchen range shaker or clothes wringer crank may be 
utilized for the crank. 



BOTTLES, GLASS UTENSILS, 
MIRRORS, ETC. 

TO CLEAN BOTTLES 

Wash first in cold water, then in hot water with baking 
soda. 

Cut up raw potato parings very finely, fill the bottle with 
them, cover with warm water and let stand twenty four 
hours. Remove a few of the parings, shake the bottle 
thoroughly, turn all out, and wash the bottle. It should 
be perfectly clean. 

Crush egg shells and put in a bottle with clear cold water. 
Shake thoroughly, empty, and rinse well. 

Put a piece of soap and a handful of small cinders in a 
bottle with hot water, shake thoroughly, rinse well, and 
drain. 

TO CUT A BOTTLE No. 1 

Wind cotton twine two or three times around the bottle 
just below where it is to be cut. Drop kerosene or alcohol 
very slowly on the cord until it is saturated, then ignite 
it with a match. When the flame has nearly died out, 
pour on a little cold water, and the bottle separates 
smoothly. 

TO CUT A BOTTLE No. 2 

To file, drill, or saw glass with a hack saw, keep the tool 
edge wet with camphor dissolved in turpentine. 

230 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 231 

TO CUT GLASS 

Fill a deep pan with water, put the hands, glass and scis- 
sors completely under water and hold them there while 
cutting any desired shape in glass. 

REMOVING STOPPERS FROM BOTTLES 

Wrap the stopper round with a cloth dipped in boiling 
water. If the bottle contains smelling salts, put it into 
vinegar and water. Leave it a short time in a warm 
place, then stand it in hot water. Then hold it in one 
hand and tap it on first one side and then the other with 
a piece of wood, with an upward stroke. 

Another way is to put a few drops of olive oil around the 
glass stopper, leave for an hour or more, and if it refuses 
to be moved, place the whole bottle in warm water and 
tap the stopper carefully on each side. 

TO REMOVE A CORK FROM BOTTLE 

Tie a nail on the loop of a string so it will not float, get 
the string under the cork and pull it out. 

To keep a cork from sticking in a glue bottle, rub it with 
vaseline. 

TO MAKE A CORK SMALLER 

Cut two wedge shaped pieces out of it at right angles 
across the small end, and it will fit tightly. 

TO KEEP GAS GLOBES FROM BREAKING 

Keep a paper clip over the edge of the globe. 



232 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

POURING HOT LIQUIDS IN GLASSES 

Put a silver spoon in a glass to prevent its breaking, when 
hot liquid is poured in. 

WHEN GLASSES STICK TOGETHER 

To separate glasses that stick together, set the lower 
glass in warm water and fill the upper with cold water. 

WASHING GLASS 

Wash cut glass in lukewarm water and brush with a 
bristle brush. 

A little soda in the water is good. 

Use small turkish towels for drying glass and silver, or 
fine linen ones. 

MIRRORS 

To clean mirrors, use a soft cloth dipped in alcohol, and 
polish with a clean dry cloth. 

Stains may be removed from mirrors by using a soft cloth 
dipped in spirits of camphor, polishing afterwards. 

Never allow the sun to shine on a mirror, as it softens 
the backing, making the glass cloudy. 

MENDING CHINA 
Use common white lead for mending china and glass. 

Apply the paint to the edges with a small stick, place 
rubber bands or twine around it to hold the parts to- 
gether, and set away to become thoroughly hardened. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 233 

It is very much better, however, to immediately throw 
out a piece of broken china, as all the mending in the 
world never makes it perfect, and there can be no satis- 
faction in having an imperfect piece of china that is liable 
at any time to fall apart and break several other pieces. 

CEMENT FOR CHINA AND GLASS 

Use common white lead. 

CEMENT FOR ENAMEL WARE 

Mix equal parts of finely sifted coal ashes, sifted table 
salt, and soft putty. Fill the hole with this mixture and 
set the dish on the fire with a little water in it till the 
cement hardens. 

Cement for joining leather, wood, and paper to metal 
mix one teaspoonful of glycerine with a gill of blue. 

FOR MENDING RUBBER ARTICLES 

Try a piece of adhesive plaster where it is practicable. 

CANDLES, LAMPS, ETC. 

Keep candles in the refrigerator several hours, to harden 
them, to prevent drooping when used for decorations. 

Fancy candles may be washed with a soft brush, with 
soap and water. 

Put fine salt on a lighted candle to make it last. 
Save all small candle ends to use in sealing fruit jars. 



234 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

When carrying a candle in a draft, fasten it by its melted 
grease in a tumbler, using a short candle. 

FILLING OIL LAMPS, ETC. 

Fill oil lamps with a funnel kept for the purpose. 
Boil the burners occasionally in soda water. 

Place a small lump of camphoi in the oil to brighten lamp- 
light. 

If a lamp gets overturned, never pour water on it, but use 
earth, flour or sand. 

LAMP WICKS 

Soak a new lampwick in vinegar and dry perfectly before 
using, to prevent it smelling badly. 

When a lampwick is too large, do not cut down the side, 
but draw several threads from the middle of the wick. 

Put a new wick in a lamp through the top instead of the 
bottom of the burner. 

Dip one inch of the end of a wick in starch and iron 
perfectly dry, to insert it easily in a burner. 

Sew a piece of white flannel to the bottom of large lamp 
wicks and they may be used a much longer time. 

TO CLEAN LAMP CHIMNEYS 

Wipe chimney with a cloth moistened with vinegar, then 
polish. 

A few drops of alcohol rubbed on the inside of a lamp 
chimney will remove all the black. 



PAPER AND BOOKS 

TO MAKE WATERPROOF PAPER 

Mix sulphuric acid of an exact strength with one half 
its weight of water. A sheet of common paper placed in 
this solution becomes hard and fibrous, yet its weight 
is not increased, and it makes a better parchment for 
writing purposes than animal parchment. 

TO RESTORE FADED WRITING 

Moisten the paper with water, then brush over with a 
solution of hydric-ammonia. 

TO PREVENT MOULD ON BOOKS 

Wipe the shelves with oil of cedar. 

TO CLEAN SOILED BOOKS 

Use two parts of water to one part of vinegar, rub over 
the soiled pages, and leave the book open to dry. 

Book covers soiled by grease may be cleaned by putting 
pipe clay or French chalk over the spots, then applying 
a warm iron. 

To clean the edges (where they are not gilt edges) close 
the book tightly and erase with an ink eraser. 

COOK BOOK COVERS 

Cook books should be covered with oil cloth or waxed 
paper.

COAL, STOVES, FURNACES, ETC. 

TO PREVENT SOOT IN CHIMNEYS 

Burn raw potato parings in the stove, or pieces of zinc 
to prevent having soot accumulate. 

TO SEE OBSTRUCTIONS IN A CHIMNEY 

Remove the soot-pan, place a hand mirror in the opening, 
and you can see to the top unless obstructed. 

Vinegar will remove lime spots and soot from an open 
chimney. 

TO START A FIRE 

Keep ashes in an old tin can and pour over kerosene 
enough to soak them. Have the grate clean and wood 
laid on it ready to light. Place two spoonfuls of ashes 
on the wood, then lay a few sticks over the ashes, have 
dampers open, and light the ashes. Keep the can of ashes 
outside, away from fire and your kindling is always ready. 
A brick may be soaked in kerosene a short time and laid 
in a grate and lighted to start either coal or wood. When 
the kerosene is burned out and the brick cold, it may be 
soaked again. 

To start a fire in the grate, first take a newspaper and in- 
sert in opening just above grate, then light paper; this 
will warm up the chimney flue and prevent smoke from 

237 



338 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

coming into room after lighting fire. This also applies 
in starting hard and soft coal burners. 

To free a grate from cinders, dump clam or oyster shells 
into the grate. 

TO KEEP A FIRE 

Soak two or three newspapers in clean cold water, squeeze 
out the water, and make the papers into good sized balls. 
Pack these tightly together on top of the red hot coal fire, 
and it will keep for hours. 

When a quick fire is needed , tear a newspaper into 
quarters without unfolding, twist each one tightly, lay 
closely in the stove, and light one end. 

Throw on a few pieces of coal and sprinkle table salt 
over them. At the end of several hours, there will be a 
good fire. 

TO WATERPROOF MATCHES 

Dip them in very hot melted paraffin and when eool, they 
are ready for use. 

TO CLEAN DISCOLORED FIREPLACE BRICK 

Rub into the bricks as much linseed oil as they will 
absorb, and repeat till they are clear. 

BLACKING A STOVE 

Use a paint brush to apply the blacking. Just before 
using stove polish, mix a tablespoonful of gasoline with 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 239 

a saucer of polish. Be sure the stove is cold and never 
use gasoline around heat. 

Turpentine is also good to use with polish. 

Clean the steel parts with boiled linseed oil on a woolen 
cloth, and clean the nickle with whiting and ammonia. 

If a stove is washed, then rubbed well with a few drops 
of linseed oil on a woolen cloth, it will never need polish- 
ing. 

IN THE OVEN 

Paint the inside of the oven with aluminum paint and it 
is a pleasure to be able to see every article in it. 

A little salt sprinkled on the bottom of the oven will pre- 
vent cakes burning. 

When possible during the winter months, do the baking 
in the furnace. 

When the hinges on the oven door are worn and the 
doors fail to catch, put washers of iron on the bolt. 

TO CUT STOVE PIPE 

Cut stove pipe easily with a can opener. 

GAS STOVES 

Wash them each time they are used, and wash with kero- 
sene once each week. 

Keep two pieces of sheet iron on top of a gas stove, large 
enough to cover it. Enough heat will be diffused from 



240 PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 

one or two burners to cook a whole meal. It will also 
keep dishes hot. 

On top of the gas stove under the burners, is a good 
place to spread a paper to catch falling particles. 

TO CLEAN ASBESTOS GAS LOGS 

To clean the asbestos gas log when it becomes blackened, 
sprinkle it with salt, light the gas, and the asbestos turns 
white. 

TO CLEAN A GAS MANTLE 

When smoke has blackened a gas mantle, sprinkle salt 
from a salt shaker on it, slowly, light the gas and let the 
salt burn off a little at a time. 

TO WHITEN A HEARTH 

Melt a little size in a jar with a quart of boiling water. 
When the size is melted, mix in the same quantity of 
whiting with just a bit of washing-blue. Wash the hearth, 
then paint with the mixture. Clean it by wiping with a 
cloth wrung out of cold water. When the whiting needs 
renewing, wash the hearthstone in hot water, and apply 
the mixture. Add more water when the mixture requires. 

PACKING THE STOVE AWAY 

Rub a little oil, vaseline or kerosene over a stove before 
packing it away, to prevent rusting. 



PROGRESS MEATLESS COOK BOOK 241 

ABOUT PLUMBING 

Slip a piece of garden hose about an inch long over the 
end of the faucets in the kitchen sink to prevent breaking 
dishes on the faucets. 

TO PREVENT PIPES FREEZING 

After water is shut off, always sprinkle a good handful 
of coarse salt over the holes in the sink with just enough 
water to carry it to the curve of the waste pipe. Treat 
all similar curves in the same manner. 

TO THAW FROZEN PIPES 

Use a hot water bottle. 

When pipes become frozen in the yard, have an electrician 
connect a transformer of suitable size into circuit ; one 
lead of the secondary is connected to the water valve or 
pipe near the curb and the other lead is connected to the 
water piping in the house. The current is then turned 
on, and the heat developed by the resistance of the water 
pipe to the flow of the electric current soon thaws the 
pipe. 

A pipe-thawing electrical outfit is now manufactured. 



CLEANING METALS, ETC. 

TO CLEAN ALUMINUM KETTLES 

Boil rhubarb peelings in them for thirty minutes. 

TO CLEAN BRASS 

Dip half a lemon in fine salt and rub over the stains, wipe 
with a soft cloth, and polish with a woolen cloth. 

After cleaning brass, polish with equal parts of paraffin 
and naphtha with enough rottenstone to make a good 
paste. Then polish with a soft dry cloth. 

Ammonia in a little water will remove verdigris from 
brass. 

Drop rusty curtain pins into ammonia water and let 
them remain for ten minutes, then dry on soft cloth. 

TO CLEAN BRONZE 

Use salt and vinegar (or lemon juice), then rinse in clear 
water and polish with a clean woolen cloth. 

TO CLEAN COPPER 

Proceed as in To Clean Brass.
