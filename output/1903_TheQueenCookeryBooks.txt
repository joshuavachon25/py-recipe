COLD FISH. 



CHAPTEE I. 
LAEGE FISH, WHOLE. 

Abioad the appearaaoe of a whole large fish in jelly, 
or en duuifroix, is far more commoii thaa it is with us, 
though a whole salmon is occasionally to he seen 
at large hall suppers and such like. Many fish are 
susoeptiUe of this treatment, with great advantageg 
for it offers a welcome change, and, moreover, allows 
of the use of many which we have almost forgotten^ 
Besides this, it must he rememhered that it is not ahso- 
lutely necessary to have a whole fish. A good cut from 
the centre of a large one (technically known as a trongon^ 
of whatever fish is chosen), the head and shoulders (in 
French the hureX or even the tail end, may be served 
cold with any of the garnishes adopted for the whole 
fish. Salmon is, of course, facile pririceps as a cold side- 
board dish. Firstly, it may be served plainly boiled in 
the usual way, with a garnish of parsley, watercress, 
&c., the sauce being handed in a boat. Corvcfctwv\\.st,^\jA

sauce it is well to observe that it is always better, when 
possible, not to add this condiment till the last minute, 
as the steeping of the fish in so rich*a substance is apt 
to make it both soppy and indigestible. As will be seen 
later in the chapter on mayonnaises and such like, the 
accusation of unwholsomeness frequently brought 
against salmon, shellfish, &c., is far more often the result 
of steeping an already rich fish in an even richer sauce (a 
sauce, moreover, which has a tendency to grow rank 
and strong if exposed to the air), than to the nature of 
the fish itself if thoroughly fresh and properly prepared. 
But though a good fresh fish may be perfectly well 
served cold after plain boiling, most connoisseurs and 
good chefs advise the use of a courtiouillorij or broth 
composed of herbs, fish-stock, wine, milk, &c., instead 
of water. This court-bouillon may be kept ready, and 
can be used over and over again, only boiling up in it 
a little more stock, &c., as the liquid evaporates. The 
method of preparing this is as follows : Slice thinly 2oz. 
each of onion, carrots, and a good bouquet (including a 
small blade of mace and Joz. each of celery and parsley), 
and fry these in ^z. of butter in a fairly large pan, 
seasoning them as they cook with half a teaspoonful of 
ialt, and half that amount of freshly-ground black pepper, 
a few peppercorns, and a small teaspoonful of grated 
horseradish ; when the vegetables are soft, but not 
coloured, add a pound of fish trimmings and a quart 
of warm water, to which you have mixed a gill of best 
French vinegar, or wine, red or white, according to 
circumstances. If made with white wine this is known as 
courUbouillon, if with red wine it becomes court-bouillon 
au bleu, whilst if vinegar is used it is called court-bouillon 
simple. Bring all these ingredients to the boil, skim 
thoroughly, then simmer steadily and gently for an 



LARGE PISH, WHOLB. 3 

hour, after which strain. It may now be kept for oae, or 
be re-boiled, whea the fish is plnnged into it, the liquid 
again allowed just to boil np after the diill caused by 
the addition of the cold fish, the kettle being then 
covered down, and its contents kept at gentle ^mmering 
point till the fish is cooked. When ready, lift the fish 
into a deep earthenware dish, and allow it to cool in 
the court-booillon— the latter, by the way, if helped 
out with a httle more fish-stock, stiffened with gelatine 
(using Joz. to |oz. of gelatine to the half pint of stock, 
according to the use you wish to put the jelly to), making 
most excellent aspic jelly for decorative or other use. 
The above quantities would be sufficient for a trout, or 
a grey mullet, but they would have to be increased 
(keeping the proportions correctly) for larger fish ; 
still as, if tightly corked down, this court-bouillon keeps 
well, this is no disadvantage. Another way of serving 
who^ fish is en marinade. For this cleanse and trim 
the fish, split it open, and rub the inside over with fine 
salt ; leave it thus, cut-side uppermost, for an hour or 
so, after which wipe it and lay it in the pan prepared for 
it. For the pan, where possible, it is beat to havf^ t^ 
fireproof dish, either of French china, or glazed eartht^ii- 
ware, oval or oblong, but in any case long enough to Int 
the fish lie out straight in it at full length. Liiifj tha 
bottom of this with sliced onion, turnip, and (sarrnlw 
(using one part turnip, or less, to two of carrot, and thrums 
of onion), scattering the surface with raincftd jianilisy, 
scraped horseradish, sweet herbs, and a generoiiM ttll/m 
ance of freshly-ground black pepper. Uy tliA Mt

gentlest way till cooked, when it muit be lifted off at 
onoe, and left to get cold in the marinade. To aerve 
fi»h thus treated, lift it out of the marinade, and plaee 
it on a dish, garnishing it with any nicely s e aso n ed 
salading to taste, moistening it with a little (very littk) 
of the marinade, and sending the rest to table in a 
sauce boat. This recipe may be varied to suit individual 
taste, tlie vinegar and wine being especially a*.matter 
for personal opinion. Moreover, the lining of the 
marinade pan may also be varied, either by simplifying, 
or increasing, the flavours. Already cooked cold fiah 
may be improved by allowing it to steep in a mixture of 
oil, vinegar, parsley, mixed herlw, peppercorns, hayleaf, 
a strip of lemon peel, cloves and salt. The ffroporiions 
for this would be half a gill of oil to one tablespoonf ul of 
vinegar, a sliallot or small onion, a bayleaf, five or^six 
cloves, a saltspoonf ul of salt, a npcHmtui of minoedjpanley 
(the stalks of parsley roughly chopped answerfvery 
well for this), lialf tliat amoimt of mixed herbs, eight or 
ten peppercorns, and one or two strips of lemon peel 
well freed from tlie whit« pith. This marinade need noi 
cover the fish as long as the latter is turned now and 
again, and basted with the liciuid, &c. This, it will be 
seen, is the same marinade as is recommended for hot 
fish, such as whiting d la Ginoise, iie. It may also be 
observed tliat tliis marinade is much liked by many 
people, when the fish is afterwards to be served as 
vinaigrette or en mayonnaise^ if it is strained and^used 
in the manufacture of the sauce. 

A more recondite, but ccirtainly excellent marinade 
is tliat recommended by (>)lonel Kenny-Herbert 
(Wyvcm), which is, I btelievo, of t!aHtern origin. "For 
a fish of lib. to ijlb. weight, MJio; thuily 3oz. of onion, 
Jaz. Juicy, frcah, green mvif'V, one capsicum, or six

green chillies freed from pith and seeds, and shredded^ 
with 2oz. of tomatoes ; arrange this in the pan as before 
and strew the surface with a teaspoonf ul each of minced 
green mint, and coriander seeds (not powder), ten or 
twelve peppercorns, and four cloves, and proceed as 
advised for ordinary marinade." Decorate fish thus 
prepared with shredded chillies, green and red, nastur- 
tium seeds, sliced green ginger, tomato and cucumber, 
and, lastly, seasoned watercress. In serving fish whole, 
en chaufroix, it is impossible to insist too strongly on 
simplicity ; a fish can be made to look quite as nice 
lying plainly on its side, as it can if curled into a letter 
S by the help of hdtelets or skewers garnished with all 
sorts of incongruous " fixings," or en dauphin^ which, 
to sensitive persons, is unpleasantly suggestive of death 
struggles. Neither are much ornamented socles of 
rice, fat, &c., to be recommended, as they take more 
time and greater skill than the average cook has at 
command, if they are to be a success. At the same time 
it must be admitted that its appearance is greatly 
enhanced if, when dishing it, the fish is laid on a crouton of 
fried bread spread with green, Oascony, or other savoury 
butter, or on a slab of plain jelly, as this allows the fish 
to stand out well from its decoration. But do let me im- 
press on the amateur cook, or the novice, the inadvisa- 
bility (to use the mildest tern) of mixing up with the 
decoration non-edible adornments, permissible at a 
state banquet or a large buffet display (perhaps), but 
utt^ly out of keeping with the service of a private 
house. Over-decoration is always to be deprecated, and 
there is no denying that it is a temptation apt to beset 
the preparer of cold viands. Did they but know it, such 
work iB more likely to win disgust and blame than 
approbation from the majority, \\\vo ^t^ \5a\ffli^^5 ^^x^

sensitive of suggestion, and to whom the idea of much 
handling of their food is especially impleasant. Tours 
de force in this matter may be wonderful, perhaps, but 
in most cases one prefers to leave them to the pages of 
professional gastronomic works intended for the benefit 
of chefs in royal houses, or large hotels. (I shall never 
forget one truly awful specimen of this misdirected 
energy I once encountered, in the shape of a rocky- 
looking sea green jelly incrusted with waving stems of 
tarragon, tiny shells, &C., and inclosing in its heart 
a whole school of wee living goldfish ! Not even the 
proud possessor's naive remark that the fishlets were 
really in a glass dish slipped into the centre of the jelly, 
consoled me for the horror, especially as I had just been 
reading a book on China, which gave a highly coloured 
description of Celestial taste in the matter of live fish.) 

If, however, an upright position is particularly 
desired for the cold fish, this may be attained when 
cooking it, by deftly insinuating a 'whole carrot, one 
side trimmed to allow it to stand fiat, into the inside 
of the fish, as this will give the required firmness to 
keep it in place, especially if the dish be garnished 
with croiitons of aspic, and cleverly arranged little 
heaps of cold cooked vegetables, tiny darioles of shrimps 
en aspic, <&;c. To arrange, when the fish has been 
opened for cleansing purposes, lay in the lightly-buttered 
carrot, fasten up the fish again, and cook it in the 
ordinary way, or en marinade, as above, keeping it 
upright by means of the vegetables lining the pan. 
In this case, however, omit the carrot from the court- 
bouillon. Still, personally, I prefer a fish resting 
naturally on its side, surrounded with seasoned water- 
cress, or other salading, or chopped aspic to taste. 

Trout of various sizes, grey and (though few people 



LARGE FISH, WHOLE. 7 

seem to reidia& it) red mullet, mackerel, tnrboC, briU, 
and even the humble haddock, are aD neari/ as ^ood 
cold as they are hot, if a little trouble be bestowed on 
the gamishings. Special recipes for the preparatioii 
of such dishes will be given in the next chapter, so 
the subject need not be enlarged on for the moment* 

Where a large piece of fish is wished for, thou^ 
a whole one might prove bejond the capaeit j of the 
cook, a large cut maj be taken from the middle of a 
good fish, and boiled either in plain acidulated water, 
or in court-bouillon, as jou please ; it is then served 
plain as it is, simply garnished with hard-bolied e^^s 
halved, with their centres filled with shrimp, lobster, 
anchovy, Qascony, or other butter to taste, and seasoned 
watercress ; or with tomatoes nicely seasoned with 
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and filled up with green 
peas, pointes d'asperges, ^., tossed m mayonnaise 
or vinaigrette dressing. Where salmon or trout is 
concerned, the fdlowing will prove a very effective 
garnish : Stone some nice oHves and fill up the centre 
with either mayonnaise or anchovy butter, or a filletted 
anchovy, then fill son^ little bouch^ moulds with 
aspic jelly, and just as this is setting fix a stuffed olive 
in each, and leave it till firm. Have ready biscuit 
crisp, square croutons, fix on each with a^ Httle just 
liquid aspic, a round of hard-boiled egg-white, and 
place one of the little olive moulds in each. These 
may be arranged round the fish alternately with little 
heaps of chopped aspic, or bunches of season salading 
to taste. Where white fish of not too strong an indi 
vidual flavour is in question, the garnish may with 
advantage be rather more strongly characteristic. 
For instance, line dariole moulds with aspic jelly, filling 
these up with cold shrimp, crab, lobster, or oyster 



8 COLD nSH, 

sauce, stiffened with two or three sheets of best leaf 
gelatine. Or (with cold cod especially), these dariofes 
may be filled with Flemish salad (i.e., a mixture of 
bloater or kipper fillets, minced apple, sliced beetroot, 
dice of potatoes, small Brussels sprouts, picked eauli* 
flower, &c., tossed in mayonnaise, and set in the aspic* 
lined moulds) ; or, again, these aspio4ined daiioles 
may be filled with a mixture of finely-shredded and 
crisped celery, blanched and bearded oysters, caTiar, 
white mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg (yolk and white), 
and coralline pepper, this being particularly nice with 
cold turbot or brill. Or, again, fill the jelly-Uned moulds 
with a mixture of tomato mayonnaise, mixed with 
grated Qruyere or Cheddar cheese, a few capers, and 
boned, skinned, and filletted sardines, finishing the 
mixture with a dash of anchovy vinegar ; this is excel- 
lent with cod or haddock. In short these little gar- 
nishes may be varied indefinitely, according to what 
you have in the house, and as they can be prepared 
some time beforehand without fear of deterioration 
(the mayonnaise being enclosed in the airtight aspic 
casing), they may be specially recomn^ended for those 
Sunday suppers which are such a crux to the average 
housekeeper. 

The hints just given may serve to help the eook 
desirous of making the best of cold fish served eo to 
say au naturel ; but the more ambitioTis cordon bleu 
may, an she will, remove the skin of the fish carefully 
and cleanly, and then proceed to mask or coat the 
surface thus exposed, to her mind. One hint I would 
fain give. If the dish has to stand long, do not use 
any kind of mayonnaise as the masking medium, for 
if exposed long to the air this sauce inevitably deterio- 
rates, the oil becoming rank and strong, even if of the 



LARGE FISH, WHOLE. ^ 

very best qualitj. If mayonnaise flavour you must 
have, lue any of the mayonnaise aspic— led, wfaite, or 
green, and when this is birly set, case it aB in just 
liquid plain aspic, as this keeps off the air and preserves 
the sauoe. 

But undoubtedly the best material for this masking 
is a savoury butter of some kind, such as maiire dChMd^ 
Qasoony, kc. as it will make a smooth, even snrfoce, 
if carefully spread with a broad-bladed knife. This 
can, of course, be further decorated with olives, hard- 
boiled egg^ aspic, or fried bread cro&tons, te., to taste. 
Tomato or other aspic may also be used for this purpose, 
or mayonnaise aspic, if carefully coated with a layer 
of aspic or savoury jelly at the last. Or, if liked, a 
nice white chaufroix sauce made with fish stock, &c., 
may be recommended, as it enhances the flavour and 
appearance at the same time, without entailing a great 
amount of trouble. 

Cold fried fish, again, is particularly good if attention 
be given to the frying, and cold dames de sauman a la 
Juive, or a good Sole Colbert will be appreciated by 
most people, though for some reason neither is often 
seen, and the respect for cold fried fish appears to be 
felt almost entirely in Jewish households in this country. 

Fish pies of various kinds may also be commended 
as jnices de rSngtanee^ as palatable as they are un- 
common. They are made in precisely the same way 
as meat pies, a farce of inferior fish being used to line 
and fill the crannies of the pie-dish, in which are imbedded 
the fillets of more delicate fish, and such addenda as 
oysters, prawns, bbster, or crab meat, hard-boiled 
^SSt ^-9 ^th ail appropriate seasoning; whikt such 
a dish as the salmon pie given in the next chapter is 
a welcome addition to the sideboard or buffet at any 



10 COLD nsH. 

time. Moreover, these pies possess the fiirther advan- 
tage of being excellent when made of either fresh or 
cold cooked fish. 

Lastly, there are galantines and collared fUh, Between 
these two dishes there is very little to choose, though 
perhaps the difference may be that in a galantine the 
fish or meat is used as a fomidation, and is more or 
less overlaid with other substances, whereas in the 
collared specimen, the fish is only spread with necessary 
seasoning, the flavour of the foundation being kept 
simple and distinct. Examples of both processes wiU 
be given later on.

or with any garnish, such as seasoned watercress, 
lettuce, caviar, &c., to taste. Another Jewish way 
of cooking fish, salmon especially, is this : Fry a sliced 
onion in a little oil till nicely browned, then drain it, 
and lay it in a pan with a nice cut of salmon, fully 
Ij inches thick, one or two parsley roots, pepper, salt, 
and a little finely-minced green ginger (failing this, 
use freshly-ground ginger, but this is not as fragrant 
as the green kind), with sufficient cold water to cover 
the fish ; bring this all to the k)il, and then only let 
it simmer till the fish is cooked. Meanwhile, prepare 
some forcemeat balls thus : Eemove the skin and bones 
from a nicely-boiled plaice, and flake the fish finely, 
mixing it with pepper, salt, minced parsley, a table- 
spoonful of fine breadcrumbs, and sufficient egg to 
bind it all ; roll this all into little balls and put these 
into the pan with the fish when the latter is about 
half cooked. When the fish is quite ready lift it out, 
pour off about one-third of the liquid in the pan (accord- 
ing to the amount of sauce you wish for), and pour 
to what is left in the pan the juice of four lemons beaten 
up with the yolks of four eggs, tossing it gently together 
till the sauce thickens nicely (but without actually 
boiling, which would curdle it), then pour it over the 
fish and the little balls, and leave till quite cold. It is 
well to remember that cold, plainly-boiled salmon, 
turbot, or indeed many other fish, such as cod, haddock, 
halibut, &c. (to say nothing of fried smelts, broiled 
trout, &c.), is excellent if plainly dished with a garnish 
of green parsley, tarragon, or fennel, and some rich 
well-made sauce, sent up separately in a sauce-boat. 
Cold tomato, curry, r^moukide, Chauron, &c., aU 
answer for this, as does also cold Dutch sattce, a some* 
what different preparation from the hot one of the

flame name. For this prepare half a pint of mote or 
less rieh custard in the usual way with egg jdks and 
milk, aeascming it with salt and coralline pepper (and, 
if liked, a drc^ or two of essence of anehoTjX ^^nd ka^

it and leave till cold. This mixture is then whidKcd 
in very gradually into the cold custard, till it is all 
light aiid frothy, when it is served vnth the cold fish. 
A couple of tahlespoonfuls of richly-coloured toniato 
pur6e added to this makes a pleasant and unusual 
change. Of course these sauces require caution, for 
though pakktahle, they are all usually very rich, and 
it must be borne in mind that a good deal of the dyspeptic 
trouble generally associated with salmon, lobster, 4zc.. 
arises Seut mcHre from the rich addenda sent to table 
vnth them than from the fish. 

Another way, very popular with some people, of 
serving plainly boiled cold fish is "soused." For this 
take a good cut of salmon, a whole trout, or a mackerel, 
as you please, and lay it in a fairly deep dish ; put into 
a small pan half a pint of good vinegar, a couple of 
daveSy a small shallot, a little fish stock, and some 
fresU^-ground pepper ; let this just boil up well, then 
strain it over the fish> and leave till cold. A prettier 
form of this dish is to substitute a strong fish aspic 
for the fish stock, or add to the latter from ^z. to ioz. 
of best leaf gelatine ; let this all boil together well till 
blended, lay the fish in a deep dish that will hold it 
nicely, and strain this liquid on to it, being careful 
to^have enough to cover the fiah ewtvi^V^^ ^xA V^a^^

till set, when it is turned out and served garnished 
with seasoned watercress,f parsley^ tarragon, &c., as 
you please. [This] is fa very favourite dish abroad, 
where [it is known ' as truite^ midet, maquereau^ &c., 
a la gelie. The fish^ should be [put in neatly, about 
an inch of the jelly being put in first ; from this, 
when set, a J inch groove is cut, to receive the back 
of the fish, which is lightly held in position with a 
skewer or something of.the^kind, whilst filling up the 
basin or mould with the rest of the aspic. When possible 
it is well to stand the dish or mould on ice, to cause 
the jelly to set more ^'quickly. The jellyjmust, of course, 
be on^the point'of setting, and only just liquid enough 
to pour. 

The ordinary way of picJding fish used in this coimtry 
is the following : As soon as the fish comes from the 
table trim it and remove the bones, covering it up 
carefully to exclude the air. Now boil {together equal 
parts of good vinegar and water (or preferably the 
liquid in which the fish was originally cooked), with 
a teaspoonful of salt, ^oz. whole allspice, and a couple 
of bay leaves, for ten minutes ; then let it stand till 
cold, when you pour it over the fish to be pickled, 
and leave it till next day. The quantity of liquid 
depends on the amoimt of fish ; the above is for the 
remains of a good cut of salmon or halibut. Almost 
any fish may be treated thus, though it is not so delicate 
as the methods previously given. 

Boiled fish en chaufroix. (To stand upright.) — 
Cleanse and trim the fish, season it lightly inside, then 
lay in a nice carrot, scraped and thinly coated with 
a very little butter. This should have one side pared 
to make it stand even. Fasten up the fish, and place 
It on the strainer, tieing it to tbia to keep it straight.

as bass, hill, dorey, haddodc, halibut, madoerel, mullet, 
salmon, &C., may be treated thus. It is wonderful 
what i^eaaant variety may be obtained by applying 
the method most cooks consider solely intended for 
the very highest class of fish, to the commoner kinds. 

Fi«fe, Stuffed.— ¥ht fish, such as chicken turbot,. 
brill, large plaice, &c., are very good if the flesh is lifted 
off the bone on both sides, keeping each side whole, then 
lay the under fillet on a well buttered baking tin, spread

Cod Steaks in Aspic {Dames de cahillavd en aspic). — 
The cod steaks used for this may be either cooked on pur- 
pose (in the oven, on a buttered baking-dish with a season- 
ing of white pepper, salt, lemon juice, &c., under a 
buttered paper), or may be cut in neat, even cutlets from 
a cold boiled fish, as you please. Pour a little good fish 
aspic, just on the point of aettuig, into «» dsfe^ ^vA 

c 



18 COLD nSH. 

delicately clean baking-dish, then lay in the steaks, which 
should be perfectly cold, leaving a good space between 
each piece ; lay a roiind of hard-boiled egg, or a star 
made with diamonds of egg white, and a romid of 
pickled walnut on each, then pour in gently sufficient 
aspic to cover the steaks nicely, and leave it till set and 
quite firm, when each steak should be cut out with a 
sharp knife or a cutlet cutter, leaving a margin of jelly 
all round, and serve with either horseradish cream, or 
tomato mayonnaise. 

Pie, — Lay a nice piece of fresh cod in salt for 

three or four hours, then wash it and season it with f reshly- 
groimd black pepper, salt, minced parsley, a dust of nut- 
meg, and a very little mace ; lay it in a buttered pie-dish 
with some morsels of butter, and a little fish stock, or equal 
parts of fish stock and light French wine, with a few 
drops of essence of anchovy. Cover with good rough puff 
paste, and bake it. When cooked lift the crust, and pour 
in the following sauce : Melt together loz. of butter and 
a tablespoonful of flour, dilute it with three or four 
tablespoonfuls of good fish stock and a gill of cream, 
season with a grate of nutmeg, and lemon-peel, a dust 
of mace, and a drop or two of lemon-juice and essence 
of anchovy ; let it just boil up, then add some bearded 
oysters (their liquor should have been added to the fish 
stock and cream), and use. Very good hot, but still 
better cold. A very nice pie can also be made from salt 
cod, if the latter is well soaked, first in running water 
and then in milk and water for twelve to twenty-four 
hours, according to the saltness of the fish. Pack a 
pie-dish with flaked, cold salt cod, adding little pats 
of anchovy or maltre d'h6tel butter, salt (if needed), 
freshly-ground black pepper, minced parsley, chives, 
4&C., and a small bunch of herbs ; cover with a good 



LABGE FISH, WHOLE. 1^ 

rough puff paste and bake. When oooked remove ibe 
bouquet, and pour in a little creamy b^cfaamei maigre. 

Slices, Jdiied (Dames de Cabillaud en geletK 

— Cut some cold boiled ood into flat, neat slices ; pour 
some savoury aspic or fish jelly into a pan or tin to about 
Jin. in depth, then lay on this, as it sets, the s&ed 
fish, garnishing each slioe with a thin slice of hard* 
boiled ^gg, or any device cut to taste from hard-boiled 
^gg white, pickled walnut, truffle, &c. Set this with a 
few drops of jelly, and, when it is firm, pour in sufficient 
jelly to cover the fish, and leave it till quite hard, when 
you cut out each slice, leaving a margin of jelly round 
each. Dish these, one overlapping the other, down the 
centre of a dish, and serve garnished with seasoned 
watercress, and with horseradish cream in a boat. 
Slices from any large fish may be served thus, varying 
the garnish to suit the fish and individual taste. Any 
chaufroix sauce may be used, or mayonnaise aspic — 
green, red, white or yellow — to taste. It may V)e 
observed that Uttle fillets treated in this manner make 
an excellent garnish for any salad, and may be recom- 
mended for Sunday supper, as the fish may Ije y^^W'mi 
beforehand, the sauce also prepared at the same time, and 
the salading left ready washed, so that the maid doin^ 
the cook's work will only have to toss the salad in th^ 
mixture (which should have been tightly corked rjown 
in a wide-mouthed bottle), pile it on the dish, and arrarn/^. 
the fish round it, garnishing this, if liked, with pi/tk^td 
shrimps, quartered hard-boiled eggs, chf/pp^d /Jly, 
^., as you choose.

pour the rest of tlie Siiedoise sauoe over it all, strew it 
with capers, shreds of chilli skins, &c., and serve. This 
di-li may be varied almost indefinitely. For instance, 
the fiah (which for this should be white) may be tossed 
in mayonnaise, dished in a ring of cold boiled rice, and 
a good, rich, cold curry sauce poured over all, and 
served as poisson a Vindienne. Or, if salmon be chosen, 
toss it in rich tomato mayonnaise, and dish it in a ring 
of iced potato, garnished with shelled shrimps or prawns. 
For the potato, rub three or four plainly boiled, medium- 
sized potatoes through a fine wire sieve, stirring into 
this puree a gill of rich b^haniel sauce, in which you have 
previously dissolved |oz. of best leaf gelatine, season to 
taste with salt, coralline pepper and a teaspoonful of 
finely minced parsley, adding at the last about half a 
pint of stiffly whipped cream ; fill a border mould with 
this mixture, and set it on ice till quite firm, when it is 
turned out, and the centre filled with the flaked salmon 
and tomato mayonnaise piled up pretty high. 

Dory in cream chaufroix (Dorade or St, Pierre 
a la cremiere). — Cook the fish in a milk and water 
court-bouillon, and leave it till cold ; then pour over 
it a very creamy white chaufroix sauce, seasoned with 
white pepper and lemon-juice, and serve, when this 
is set, with a garnish of picked shrimps tossed in a 
vinaigrette, or tomato sauce. 

EeL Collared.— Km an eel, remove the head, tail, 
and bones, and lay the eel, skin side down, on the table ; 
pound some sage as finely as possible, mix it with freshly- 
grated black pepper, a grate of nutmeg, some salt, 
and, if liked, a little parsley and allspice ; lay this mixture 
smoothly over the eel, and roll it up tightly, tying it into 
shape with broad tape or a clean cloth. Put into a pan 
iufhclerii salted ^^a\.fcx to Q»\^x \)tsfc ^h. generously, 



LAEGB PISH, WHOLE. 21 

add five or six cloves, the same of peppercorns, two 
or three blades of mace, and a good bouquet (parsley, 
thyme, bayleaf, and lemon peel), with the head, tail, 
and bones of the eel, and boil till it is nicely flavoured ; 
then lay in the eel, again let the liquor boil up, 
draw it to the side, and allow it to simmer gently till 
the fish is tender. Now take it out, boil up the liquor, 
strain it, remove the fat, and pour it over the eel, and 
let it all stand till cold, but do not take off the cloth 
till you want to use it. When you take it out of its 
cloth, wipe it well, and serve it whole or cut in slices, 
as you please. The liquor in which it was cooked, 
if clarified like any other stock and slightly aciddated 
with either lemon-juice or vinegar, will make an excel- 
lent garnishing jelly. This liquor will also serve as 
a pickle to keep it, if not wanted for immediate u>ie. 
It may be as well to observe here, that to kill the eel 
at once, you should pierce the spinal marrow close U) 
the base of the skull with a sharp pointed skewer ; if 
done in the right place all motion ceases at once. 

Galantine.— Alter killing it, skin a large 

eel very carefully, bone it, and lay it open flat, spread 
over it, with a knife, a nice fish farce (for this some 
people use pike meat), and cover this with truffles, 
cooked tongue, and gherkin, sliced small but not too 
thinly, lay a little more farce over this, then roll the 
eel up neatly, and sew it into shape ; wrap some slices 
of bacon round it, lay it in a cloth, fastening the ends, 
and sewing up the napkin that the fish may keep its 
right shape ; now put it into a fish kettle, with a cooked 
marinade, bring this well to the boil, and when it has 
simmered for thirty to forty minutes (t.e., till the eel 
is cooked) lift the galantine into an earthenware^basin, 
pour the strained marinade over it, and allow it to 



22 COLD FISH. 

cool in its liquor. When cold remove the cloth care- 
fully, wipe, and trim the eel, and brush it over with 
savoury jelly. When this is quite set, garnish with 
parsley, chopped jelly, and little balls of Montpelier, 
or green butter, as you please. For the cooked marinade^ 
slice three carrots and four onions, with two bayleavea, 
a spray of thyme, and two cloves, and toss these over 
the fire in a little butter ; when the carrots and onions 
are cooked, but not coloured, add some parsley, a chopped 
Fallot or two, a dessertspoonful of flour, half a gill of 
good vinegar, or lemon juice, a gill of strong fish stock, 
salt and pepper to taste ; simmer this all for three-quarters 
of an hour, then strain it through a horse-hair sieve 
and use. 

Potted, — Skin the eels, remove their back 

bones, and cut them in lengths to fit your pot ; lay 
them in this, seasoning them with salt, black pepper, 
cayenne, and a little powdered mace ; add a few piecea 
of butter, or well clarified dripping, and tie down the 
dish with doubled brown paper ; bake in a slow oven 
till thoroughly cooked, and when done pour off the 
gravy, pressing them well that none may remain, 
and when cold cover with clarified butter, about J inch 
thick. 

Haddock en Aspic. — Choose a nice large haddock 
(almost any fish may be cooked this way), and after 
cleansing it, insert inside it a carrot lightly brushed 
over with butter, and trimmed on one side to make 
it stand flat ; place the fiish in position in the fish kettle, 
banking it up with a few soup vegetables, and cook 
it in a court-bouillon ; when done, lift it out, and leave 
it till perfectly cold before removing it from the strainer. 
It should be cooked very slowly, allowing about ten 
minutes to the pound. Ynafcii y^il^cxV^ «iV^, T^\jQa\e

saffron, mixing this all well together, then adding 
enough of the fish Hquor to produce the amount of 
sauce required ; thicken this well over the fire, pour 
it on to the fish, add the little liver balls, and cook these 
for a few minutes in the sauce, then set it all aside, till 
cold. For the balls, cook the liver of a cod, then mince 
it very finely, add a few breadcrumbs, the whites of 
two eggs, the finely-chopped onion kept back for the 
purpose, a little minced parsley, freshly-grated black 
pepper, salt, and a tiny pinch of mixed spice. Roll 
this into little balls, adding sufficient breadcrumbs 
to produce the right consistency, and cook them for 
a few minutes in the sauce. This dish is, by-the-way, 
quite as good hot as it is cold. 

Lobster, Moulded. — Choose a lobster mould for this 
dish, oil the inside lightly, and place it on ice, line it 
smoothly with tomato mayonnaise stiffened with 
aspic jelly, being careful to have it of a very good colour, 
and to pack the mould so evenly as to insure the shape 
being neat when turned out ; meanwhile, trim the 
fleilij of two lobsters (large crawfish may be used, or 
even good tinned lobster for this dish) into large scallops ; 
mince the trimmings and the flesh from the claws 
into Uttle dice, which you mix with some cut up cooked 
vegetables, varying these as > much as possible, and 
seasoning them with pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar ; 
pack this in alternate layers all into the mould, and 
cover it with a J inch layer of the tomato aspic ; 
leave the mould on crushed ice till thoroughly firm. 
Meanwhile, fill a square or oval baking tin with aspic 
or savoury jelly, and leave this till perfectly set and 
hard, when you turn it out on to the dish it is to be 
served in, and turn the lobster mould out on to it, 
garnishing this with little balls of Montpelier, or green

'butter, and chopped aspic and seasoned watercress. 
This is a great supper or buffet dish abroad, but is 
quite as good if the whole is packed neatly into a plain 
round Charlotte mould, and stood on a slice of bread 
cut a size or two larger than the mould, fried a delicate 
golden brown and biscuit crisp, then spread when 
eold with a thick, even coating of maltre d'h^tel butter. 
This may also be made with fillets of any cold fish, 
only mixing a little lobster, minced shrimps or prawns, 
kc., with the mac^oine. Lobster is so seldom served 
cold save en mayonnaise that any detailed description 
of its treatment must be given amongst the salads. 

Mackerel, Boiled.— -Bemoye the heads, and thoroughly 
cleanse, some soft-roed mackerel, remove the back- 
bones, and halve the fish lengthways ; lay a piece of the 
roe on each half ; dust each with pepper, salt, and a very 
little sifted flour, and roll each half up tightly, tail out ; 
pack these little rolls in a deep baking-dish, pour over 
them sufficient vinegar (a little diluted with water) 
to just cover them, season with fresh black pepper and 
salt, cover the fish with a reversed plate, and bake one 
and a half hours in a moderate oven. When cooked, 
lift the fish out on to a clean dish, stir about a dessert- 
spoonful of essence of anchovy (according to the size of 
the dish) into the. fish liquor, and strain this on to the 
fish. This dish, l^ the way, is as nice hot as cold. 

Collmred. — Clean and split some nice large 

mackerel, removing the heads and backbones (these 
may be broiled and make an excellent savoury with 
either cooked soft roes or broiled mushrooms), rub the fish 
weU with a mixture of salt, freshly-ground h\sLck pepper, 
mace, allspce, and cbves, all finely powdered ; roll the 
fish up tightly, tying them into shape with broad tape 
or strips of calico. Cook them in [acidulated and 



26 COLD FISH. 

salted water for twenty minutes or so, till ready, when 
they are lifted out, placed in a piedish with sufficient 
of their liquor to cover them, and left till next day. 
\Vhen wanted for use, remove the tapes, return them 
to the dish with the liquor, to which you add a little 
more vinegar if necessary, and serve garnished with 
sprays of fennel. 

en Mayonnaise^ or a la Vert-pre, — Lift the 

fillets off as neatly and whole as possible from the 
requisite number of cold boiled mackerel, and arrange 
these fillets evenly in fours, piling them as timber is 
piled ; have ready a nice green mayonnaise flavoured 
with minced tarragon and fennel, and pour this over the 
piled-up fish, serving it garnished with sprays of 
fennel and shelled prawns or shrimps, as preferred. 
Another version of this is masked with tomato mayon- 
naise, and decorated with seasoned watercress. 

/S'o/^cd.— Cleanse some very fresh mackerel 

\^ry carefully, and wipe them well inside and out with 
a clean cloth ; meanwhile mix together in a crock half a 
gallon of cold water, lib. of salt, Joz. saltpetre, and ilb. 
of coarse brown sugar ; lay the fish into this, and leave 
them to steep for six hours or so, according to size ; then 
lift them out, straighten and stretch them well between 
two laths, rinse them well with the pickle, and hang them 
up by the head to dry. (For this the Scotch fisherwives 
use triangles of three laths nailed together — with nails 
run through them so that each fish hangs clear and 
separate— and usually dry them in the open.) They 
should dry for an hour or so, then be put in the smoke 
in a hot corner for an hour, being shifted to a cooler 
place and left in the smoke till they are of a rich dark 
brown (this takes from eighteen to twenty-four hours).

28 COLD FISH. 

-)<Redy en Mayonnaise. — Broil the fish, fillet 



and bone them when cold, and derve covered^ with 
mayonnaise flavoured with green tarragon and tarragon 
vinegar, in the same way as is recommended for Mackerel 
a la Vert-pre, 

Pike in Jelly {Brocket en aspic).— Thoroughly cleanse 
a pike, and either stuff it with a rich forcemeat, or put 
inside a large carrot trimmed flat on one side and well- 
coated with butter ; fasten up the fish, roll it in thinly- 
sliced fat bacon, or a heavily-buttered paper, tie it up in 
a clean cloth, and cook it till done in a court-bouillon, 
with either Sauterne, or such like, or sherry, to which 
you have added half its bulk of water and a good flavour- 
ing of lemon-juice. When ready, lift it out and fix it 
firmly in a pan, back up, as if swimming, pour its liquor 
over it, and leave till perfectly cold. Now drain it 
thoroughly, wipe it with a clean cloth, and with a sharp 
knife make a deep cut each side the backbone, and 
carefully remove the fillets on each side as whole and 
cleanly as you can. Trim off the skin, and sUce the 
fillets neatly (a process the consistency of this fish]renders 
•easy), and then replace them in position. Brush the 
fish over thoroughly with somejpretty stiff aspic jelly, 
and when this is set, hft it on to its dish. A drainer, 
OT a sheet of wood, neatly covered with a napkin, should 
be set imder the fiish to raise it a little, but it must not 
project as far as the garnish. For the latter various 
things are adopted. Chefs use silver skewers, using 
three or five according to the size of the fish, garnishing 
them in pairs or in sizes, as they fancy, with crayfish 
or prawns, hard-boiled egg yolks, truffles, gherkins, &c. ; 
but a very satisfactory, if simpler decoration, may be 
produced with halved hard-boiled eggs, the whites being 
jS/Jed up with ^ shrimp, lobster, or ^anchovy butter,

this on ice till firmly set, then garnish by means of a bag 
and pipe with butter beaten to a cream, and coloured a 
very pale green with parsley greening, anchovy or 
lobster butter of a rich red tint, and plain cream butter 
left its natural tint. Dish neatly and serve garnished 
with little dariols or croutons of aspic, crayfish, truffles, 
&c., together with hdtelets or skewers to taste. This, 
however, is a dish only fit for pubUc banquets, &c., 
and cannot fairly be expected from the ordinary plain 
cook. A version she might, however, perfectly produce 
is the simpler one loved by and known to the French 
mendgire S3 S.ala Norvegienne, For this cook the fish, 
as before, in a court-bouillon, and, when perfectly cold, 
drain, wipe, and dish it, back up, fixing it into position 
with crotitons of fried bread spread with green or 
anchovy butter, brush it over evenly with aspic jelly, 
and, as this is setting, garnish it down both sides with 
washed and boned fillets of anchovy, applied diagonally 
all the length of the fish, setting these with a little more 
aspic. Serve with seasoned watercress and chopped 
aspic jelly, green or tomato mayonnaise being handed 
in a boat. If a little extra garnish is desired add a few 
hardboiled and quartered eggs with the watercress. 
Plover's eggs, when obtainable, make this into a most 
recherche dish. The name is derived from the smoked 
Norwegian anchovies used in the garnishing. A good 
cut from a large fish, or whole trout, grilse, shad, bass, 
or even large mackerel, can with advantage be treated 
thus. It should be added that French cooks treat salmon 
in this way constantly, varying the covering sauce to 
taste, and the name also, accordingly, but it may be 
forgiven an English cook for observing that for these 
recondite dishes, with their strong additional flavours, 
it js better to use the foreign and less self-flavoured

fish, which does not suffer from the extraneous condi- 
ments, as does our native fish, which is always best 
served as plainly as possible. 

a la Chevreuse. — For this a good cut from 

the middle of the fish is usually taken, though of course, 
if desired, the whole fish could be thus treated. Scale 
and well wash a good cut, say 5lb. or 6lb. at least, wrap 
it in thin sUces of larding or fat bacon, tying these on 
with broad tape, and place the fish in a convenient- 
sized fish kettle, moistening it to half its depth with 
rich fish stock, strongly flavoured with Chablis or 
Sauterne ; bring this to the boil, and let it simmer very 
gently till done, then lift it into a pan and let it cool in 
its own hquor. When nearly cold remove the bacon 
and the skin, and trim it neatly. Lay the fish flat on 
a reversed dish, and brush it all over with rather stiff 
aspic. Divide the length mentally into five portions, 
reserving three for the centre. Cover the two outside 
parts with a smooth coating of yellow mayonnaise aspic, 
and leave this till nearly set. For the centre have thinly 
sliced cucumber, and arrange these slices in a row from 
the outside band of mayonnaise, placing another row 
over these to imitate the fish scales, graduating the 
slices to the size of the fish, till all the parts left are 
evenly covered with these pale green scales. For this 
purpose, before sUcing the cucumber, instead of peeling 
it entirely, just cut off the ridges so as to leave T)its of 
the skin, and thus give it a frilly sort of look. When this 
is finished, fix it all with a little just liquid aspic to keep 
itjteady, and glaze it. Finish it by forcing out lines of 
truffle butter at the edges, and just half an inch or so 
inside the bands of mayonnaise at the ends, and little 
stars of Montp61ier butter down the centre of each 
yellow band. Press out a thick rope of chopped aspic 



32 COLD FISH. 

all round the fish, and garnish beyond this with tri- 
angular blocks of aspic. Send a sauce ravigotte to table 
with this dish. Trout, &c., can also be done thus, 
it being more troublesome than difficult to produce. 

Salmon may, of course, be soused or pickled like any 
other fish. Another fact that few housewives appear 
to recognise is that salmon head and shoulder, or the 
tail end piece, may be utilised for any decorative dish 
quite as well as the more costly middle cut ; the tail end 
especially is excellent for practice, for no one cares to 
set before their friends either their own or their cook's 
trial trips ! Always have a new dish, however easy the 
directions may sound, carefully tested, before the results 
are made public. In France, where these parts of the 
fish are not as despised as they are with us, a hure de 
saumon, or a queucy is constantly served a la anything 
you please. 

Pie, — Skin and bone 2lb. or 3lb. of salmon 

and trim it into neat slices, sprinkling these with white 
pepper, salt, and a little minced spice. Have ready a rich 
forcemeat of white fish (haddock, whiting, &c., as pre- 
viously described), made with Jib. of fish ; line a raised 
pie mould with a nice raised crust, and line this an inch 
thick with forcemeat, placing on this some of the salmon, 
and repeating these two layers till the dish is full, the 
filling being raised in a dome shape and well packed in. 
Cover with puff paste and bake very slowly. When 
cooked, let it rest for half an hour, then add the following 
gravy and serve when perfectly cold. For the gravy 
boil together 4oz. of lean ham cut into dice, one shallot, 
2oz. of sliced carrot, a nice bouquet, and a claretglassful 
of Chablis, and let it boil till the wine is reduced one- 
fourth part ; then add a gill of strong white stock 
{chicken or veal), simmer it together for half an hour. 



LARGE FISH, WHOLE. 33 

strain, and add it to half a pint of rich, and very strong, 
fish stock, and pour this all into the pie when cold. If 
the fish stock is not strong enough to jelly of itself, 
dissolve in it ioz. or so of best leaf gelatine, and use. For 
maigre purposes use smoked salmon, and strong fish 
stock, for the ham, and chicken stock. 

Salmon and Lobster Pie. — Well wipe from lib. to 2lb. of 
salmon and cut it into three or four slices ; chop up a 
tin of lobster, or a small lobster, and stir it into half a 
pint of rich bechamel sauce (we always use three-quarters 
of a pint of good, well-made lobster sauce instead of this). 
Butter a medium-sized piedish, and put into it a layer of 
the sauce, then a slice of salmon, repeating these layers 
till fish and sauce are alike used up, seasoning each 
layer as you add it with white and coralline pepper, 
salt, and a very little mace and nutmeg ; sliced truffle 
or hardboiled egg may also be introduced between the 
layers ; now pour in sufficient rich fish stock to moisten 
it, lay six or seven little fish quenelles on the top of all, 
dotting Joz. to ?oz. of butter, cut up small, over the sur- 
face, and cover with a good puiBf paste cover decorated with 
pastry leaves, &c., and brush it over with beaten egg 
yolk. Bake in a fairly hot oven for an hour. This is as 
good hot as cold. 

Sole a la Colbert — Make an incision down the side of 
the backbone on the dark side of the fish, and break the 
backbone thus uncovered in two or three places with 
the handle of a cook*s knife, being careful not to spoil 
the look of the fish. Now egg and breadcrumb it in 
the usual way, and fry a golden brown in plenty of hot 
fat. The flesh will shrink from the bone in the cooking. 
When ready to lift it out, drain well, then remove the 
broken backbone entirely, and fill up the cavity thus 
left with either a d*uxellea mixtMC^, at ^^fc\i^ ^x ^M^^Nst^

d'h6tel butter as you please. Serve the fish when 
perfectly cold either plain, or with any cold sauce, such 
as mayonnaise, tartare, or mousseline glac6e, to taste. 
Plainly boiled sole, or sole stewed in milk, is very nice 
cold if the bone is treated in this way and the hollow 
filled up with Gascony butter, anchovy cream or lobster 
sauce being served in a boat with it. 

Soles pickled^ Cape fashion, — Slice and fry four large 
onions in hot oil till browned, then add loz. of curry 
powder, two finely-minced chillies, a dessertspoonful of 
salt, and loz. mango relish or chutney ; stir this all to a 
paste, moistening it with a little vinegar. Now lay two 
large, fresh, filleted soles in a jar, packing these with 
alternate layers of the previous paste ; cut two more 
onions into rings, and boil these with a little salt and 
another ounce of curry powder in a quart of good vinegar 
(less that used in moistening the curry and chutney 
paste) very gently and slowly till tender. Now pour 
all this over the soles and do not cover or cork down the 
jar till perfectly cold. This is fit for use in a few days, 
though it will keep for months. Specially nice for 
lunch. 

Sturgeon is very good if prepared either by the recipes 
given for pike or for salmon. Only remember it is a 
very firm, not to say tough, fish, so prolonged and gentle 
simmering is needed to cook it properly. Its flesh is so 
like veal that it may be served in many ways recom- 
mended for the latter, and is particularly good en galavr 
tine. 

Trout, salmon or otherwise, is good cooked, if large, 
by any recipes suggested for salmon. If small, the trout 
should be boiled or broiled, left till cold, and served plain 
with a garnish of seasoned watercress and any cold sauce 
to taste in a boat. It may also be soused or pickled. 



LARGE FISH, WHOLE, 35 

Turbot en aspic. — Skin and fillet a turbot, keeping the 
four fillets as whole and neat as possible, place them in a 
well-buttered baking tin, sprinkling them with a little 
Chablis or Sauteme, lemon juice, coralline pepper and 
salt. Cover with a buttered paper, and bake in 
the oven according to size and thickness. When cooked 
lift them out carefully and set them on a dish, reversing 
another over them and lightly weighting this to keep 
the fillets flat and even. Prepare a nice d'uxelles, or a 
mince of shrimps, or lobster mixed with tomato aspic, 
and when the fish is perfectly cold dish the imder fillets 
side by side in position, and spread them thickly with 
the farce described ; now cover with the other two fillets, 
keeping the shape of the fish as much as possible, 
pour over it sufficient jelly to cover it neatly, and leave 
this till set. Now trim off the superfluous aspic, and 
force out a thick rope of chopped aspic round the fish, 
garnishing it with seasoned watercress, and the little 
moulds of stuffed olives given in the first chapter. Of 
course this garnish may be as varied as you please ; 
prawns, olives preserved in oil, plovers' eggs, hard boiled 
stuffed eggs, &c., being used according to taste and 
convenience. 

Pie, — Three parts cook a small turbot in a 

nice court-bouillon, then lift it out, removing the skin and 
the bones, and cut the fish into neat pieces ; arrange a 
layer of these pieces in a well-buttered piedish, seasoning 
this well with white pepper, salt, a very little powdered 
nutmeg, a grate of lemon rind, and some minced parsley 
and chives (failing these use very finely-minced shallot), 
cover with a layer of sliced hard boiled egg^ and well- 
washed fillets of anchovy, moistening these with some 
rich b^hamel sauce or thick cream, and continue these 
layers till the dish is full, raising it well ycl \?Cifc ^K«iQ«.*

36 COLD FISH. 

Dot the top over with morsels of butter, cover with a 
good puff-paste, decorated to taste, and bake for an 
hour in a moderate oven. This may be eaten hot as well 
as cold. If preferred, the fish may be cut up whole, the 
bones and skin being left on. Any white fish may be 
treated in this way, the addenda being varied to match. 



CHAPTEE ni. 

MAYONNAISE, VINAIGEETTES, &c. 

The fashion of serving cold fish appears to be spreading, 
and most cooks can now send to table cold fish in one or 
two ways, though it must be confessed that mayonnaise, 
whether pf salmon, lobster, or other fish, is usually the 
pQce de resistance on such occasions. Now a good many 
people who aver that they cannot touch either of the 
two first-named fish, denounce the unwholesomeness of 
fish mayonnaise on account of the richness both of the 
fish and of the i^uce. As regards the fish, this is very 
probably a mistake, though I admit as much cannot be 
said for the sauce, especiallyif the dish has been prepared 
some time before serving it, the sauce having in conse- 
quence deteriorated to a painful extent. Mayonnaise 
sauce exposed to the air is very apt to become rank and 
strong, the oil being especially evident, in which condi- 
tion it is not the most digestible condiment available, 
and a rich fish, such as salmon for instance, allowed to 
steep in this compound, naturally does not become more 
eupeptic. If these objectors would try their fish simply 
dressed with a cold [oil and vinegar (French salad) dress- 
ing, I think they would very hkely find that even lobster 
would agree fairly well ; try the following, for instance : 
Flake the fish^up neatly (or ii a\o\i^\fcT\» \>sfe^^<5N5^»\5sss^ 



38 COLD FISH. 

into nicefpieces), and toss the fish lightly in a vinaigrette 
sauce made thus : Mix together a dessertspoonful of 
French mustard (or use half English, half French), a 
saltspoonful of salt, and half that quantity of freshly- 
ground black pepper ; moisten this carefully and gradu- 
ally with salad oil and vinegar, using a teaspoonful of 
vinegar to every eight teaspoonfuls of oil ; when this is 
well blended, stir in a tablespoonful of minced parsley, 
chives, chervil, tarragon, &c., adding however two parts 
of parsley to each part of the other herbs. This sauce 
may be varied by using plain vinegar and omitting the 
tarragon ; or anchovy vinegar and minced mustard and 
cress may be used ; this is especially good with any form 
of shellfish. (Anchovy vinegar may be bought at most 
good Italian warehouses, or it may be made at home by 
the recipe given in No. III. of this series on "Pickles and 
Preserves " ; or lastly, where the clearness of the sauce is 
not of so much importance, a teaspoonful of Burgess's 
essence of anchovy may be stirred in a gill of the best 
malt vinegar.) When the fish has been thoroughly but 
lightly mixed with this dressing, it should be lifted into 
the dish it is to be served in, surrounded with quartered 
lettuces, and dusted with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg 
crushed through a sieve* This last is of course a matter 
of taste. For those who like it, a boatful of mayonnaise 
sauce, may be sent to table with this, though it is not a 
necessity. Almost any fish may be prepared in this way, 
and few, save those who have tried it, know how good 
the most ordinary cold fish can be if treated in this 
manner. Needless, presumably, to add, this form of 
fish salad can be elaborated to any extent by the addition 
of washed, boned, and filleted anchovies, caviar, oUves 
(stoned and farced, or not, as preferred), shrimps, or 
prawns, &c., according to the fish used. 



MAYONNAISE, VINAIGRETTES, «&c. 39 

The following recipes will give some idea of the way in 
which cold fish of all kinds may be served. 

Fish Fillets in Mayonnaise, — ^Take the fillets from 
any nice cold, cooked fish, trim them neatly, lift each 
separately on a broad-bladed or palette knife, and with a 
spoon ladle over each in turn any nice mayonnaise 
aspic (using three large tablespoonfuls of any good 
mayonnaise — plain, white, green, red, &c., as you please 
— to half a pint of just liquid aspic, stirring it well 
together till it begins to thicken, then use) ; leave these 
till set, then brush them over lightly with very clear 
aspic, just to glaze them ; dish, when set, either en 
couronne^ filling the centre with any good salad mixed 
with mayonnaise, or on a border of plain aspic, or on a 
border lined with aspic; and filled up with any salading, 
or macMoine of cold cooked vegetables, mixed with 
either a vinaigrette or a mayonnaise dressing to taste. 
Needless to say, the fish may be dressed thus after it has 
appeared hot, or it may be cooked and allowed to cool 
under a weight, the latter being the preferable method 
if for a dinner or supper party. The method of serving 
may be varied indefinitely. For instance, if each fillet 
is dished in a different coloured aspic, say, tomato, 
white, and green, it is called Filets de so-and-so a la 
Pompadour: if masked alternately with green and white 
mayonnaise, with salad in the centre, a garnish 
of cucumber, and white of hard-boiled eggs, it is known 
as Filets de so-and-so a la Due de Naples. If masked 
with a rich creamy white chaufroix, mounted on an 
aspic border, with a mayonnaise of peas, or asparagus 
points in the centre, it is called Filets de so-ftnd-so d la 
Princesse (this is a favourite way of serving salmon) ; 
or again, if masked with a pale green cucumber sauce 
stiffened with gelatine, witlv a ^^ o\ ^\ms^«!^ckws ^is^ 



40 '. COLD FISH. 

tomatoes in the centre, it is called Filets aux Con- 
combrea, (Thia is an especially good way of serving 
salmon, whether twice cooked or canned.) 

Salad, — Flake the remains of any nice cold 

white fish, such as turbot, brill, dorey, sole, halibut, &c., 
removing all skin and bone (cooks can save themselves 
much trouble, and improve the appearance of their 
salads, if they will remember to remove the bones and 
skin from any fish intended for subsequent reappearance 
as mayonnaise, &c., whilst it is still hot, as the flesh 
comes away much cleaner and entire than if flaked 
when absolutely cold) ; now lay these flakes in a deep 
dish and pour over them sufficient oil and vinegar, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, to reach halfway up the 
fish flakes, and leave it all to marinade in this for a couple 
of hours, turning it once or twice in the process. When 
ready drain well, and pile the fish in the centre of a 
bowl, arranging tiny pats or balls of anchovy butter 
amongst it ; slice two or three cold cooked potatoes, 
add to them some capers, some sliced or minced gherkins, 
a slice or two of beetroot minced, and some fillets of 
anchovy, toss these all in rather thin mayonnaise sauce, 
and pile the mixture, dome-fashion, over the fish, finally 
garnishing and surrounding it all with broken-up 
lettuce, &c., and sliced hard-boiled egg. This is a dish 
that may, manifestly, be varied to taste. 

(Mock Crab d la Wyvem), — ^This excellent 

salad invented by the culinary writer whose name it 
bears, is said to have the merit of possessing all the 
flavour of a shellfish salad without its dyspeptic dangers. 
Anyway, hygienic or not, it is sufficiently good to justify 
its existence. Shred any white fish as before into small 
flakes with two forks, lay these shreds in a bowl, season- 
ias' tbem well with salt and ^epa\ v^i^^i \ (or l^lb. of 



MAYONNAKE, VINAIGRETTES, Ac. 41 

the shredded fish mix well together a gill of anchovy 
vinegar, two tablespoonfnls of made mustard, and a full 
tablespoonful of salad oil (working tliis all well together 
till thoroughly amalgamated), and moisten the fish with it, 
dusting the mass with four tablespoonf uls of finely-grated 
Gruydre or Cheddar cheese (do not use Parmesan for 
this), and toss it all well together with the salad servers ; 
dish this mixture in a dome shape in the salad bowl, 
and serve garnished with seasoned watercress, sliced 
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber, quartered or sliced, hard- 
boiled eggs, chopped aspic, &c., according to what you 
have at hand, and set it on ice till wanted. A boat of thin 
mayonnaise may be sent to table with it. It should 
be added that this salad is perhaps nicest if made with 
eod. 

In Cases. — Shred any white fish finely 

and marinade it as before, then mix it lightly with 
julienne strips of hard-boiled egg white, anchovy fillets, 
minced olives, and any finely broken-up salading to 
taste ; now mix this well with a little mayonnaise, and 
pile it up high in little paper or china cases or shells, 
then cover it smoothly with mayonnaise, garnishing 
this with strips of red chilli skin (from the pickle bottle), 
tiny fillets of anchovy, stoned olives farced with anchovy 
or lobster butter, &c., to taste. This dish, known as 
Petites eaisseSy or Coquilles^ de poisson en Mayonnaise, is a 
wonderfully economical one, as all sorts of scraps may 
be used up ; for instance, a spoonful or two of bbster, 
oyster, or shrimp sauce left over is always an improve- 
ment, whilst the foundation need not by any means be 
Confined to one sort of fish. 

(for a Sunday supper).— Flake up the 

remains of any nice fish free from skin and bone, and 
mix it in a basin with some picked shrimps (blanched

and cut up scallops, prawns, lobster, oysters, &c., may 
all be used), anchovy fillets, olives stoned and farced, 
or plain, minced parsley, sliced or minced hard-boiled 
eggs, &c., according to what is handy, till the basin is 
nearly full (it must not be tightly packed), then pour 
in gently sufficient just liquid aspic to fill it and to cover 
the fish, and put it aside to set. Make some good and 
rather rich mayonnaise, to which, just at the last, 
you stir in a tablespoonful of absolutely boiling water 
for each full half-pint of sauce, then cork it up tightly 
m a wide-necked bottle, and put it away in a cool place. 
Now, if the cook will well wash the lettuce and other 
salading the very last thing before she goes up to dress 
for her outing, and leaves it to drain in the hung-up 
basket in a cool corner, whoever takes her work, during 
her outing, will only have to dip the basin in hot water, 
wiping the surface to remove any moisture, and then 
reverse it on a dish ; it is then garnished with the dry 
salading, and the sauce may be either poured over this 
garnish or sent to table in a separate boat. This makes 
a pretty and appetising dish, and the mayonnaise, being 
well-corked down, does not acquire the rank, coarse taste 
which is the result of long-standing exposed to the air. 

a Vltalienne. — Free some cold, cooked cod 

or other firm white fish, flaking it as much as possible 
into shell-like pieces, breaking up the rest small, and 
tossing it with two forks with shrimps, anchovy fillets, 
dice of hard-boiled egg, capers, &c., seasoning it lightly 
but thoroughly with a vinaigrette dressing, and let it 
stand till well flavoured ; then pile it up in the centre of a 
dish, arrange some fresh, well-washed salading of any 
kind in a ring round the fish, dust it all with freshly- 
ground, black pepper, and, if liked, a little grated 
P&rmes&n; oover-the dome ol feliVv\\v«ciTaft x«A,hftr thin 



MAYONNAISE, VINAIGRETTES, &c. 43 

tomato sauce, in which you have previously stirred a 
spoonful (according to quantity) of anchovy vinegar, 
and, if liked, a little grated Parmesan ; now arrange the 
shell-pieces round the green stuff, filling each with some 
tiiick tomato pur6e or mayonnaise, and garnishing 
ibis with a little ball of egg butter, a rolled fillet of 
ancboyy, a little caviar, or, in fact, anything handy, 
and serve. 

{MHangie), — Cook a small, smoked haddock in 

milk, or take the remains of a cold cooked one and flake 
it small, free from skin and bone. Cook a small, fresh 
haddock or codling and leave it till cold ; or take an 
equivalent amount of cold cooked salmon, lemon sole, 
or other cold fish, and flake it up. Well wash and dry 
a ** mixed salad," and break it up pretty small (do not 
cut it with a knife), put it into a basin with a good supply 
of French salad dressing, and toss it well together till 
thoroughly saturated with the dressing ; then lift it out 
into the salad bowl, add to it a very finely-minced 
shallot, or some minced chives or very small spring 
onions, the flaked fish, a small tin of royans, or sardines 
(previously boned and skinned), a spoonful of anchovy 
vinegar, and a Uttle more oil, toss it well together, and 
serve, after strewing the surface of the saktd with a 
handful of picked shrimps. This saktd is very economical, 
as it will use all sorts of fish scraps, for the greater the 
variety the more people seem to like it. For instance, 
cold cooked salt cod, flaked, may be used with minced 
anchovies and dice of hard-boiled egg, instead of the 
fresh fish and the shrimps ; or canned prawns, caviar, a 
mould of the well-known thon marine, a tin of royans 
h la moutarde, or aux tomates, or fillets of kippered fish 
or bloaters (especiedly if previously soaked in a little 
milk), may all be utilised. 



44 , COLD FISH. 

a VAnglaise. — Put into a salad bowl a layer 



of broken-up fresh lettuce strongly seasoned with oil, 
vinegar, salt, and freshly-ground black pepper, and on 
this put a layer of flaked fish tossed in mayonnaise ; then 
arrange round it hard-boiled eggs halved lengthwise, 
the yolks removed and the cavity filled with minced 
shrimps, prawns, &c., tossed in oil, vinegar, salt and 
pepper. Finish with little tufts of seasoned watercress, 
and serve at once. To be eaten in perfection this salad 
must be freshly made. 

aux Tomates. — This salad depends entirely 

on its dressing, for fish of any kind may be used, one 
sort or more, according to what is handy, whilst the 
salad may be fresh, or composed of a mac6doine of cold 
cooked vegetables, as you please. For the sauce : Crush 
the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs with a wooden spoon, 
mixing them smoothly with a raw egg yolk, then mix 
in drop by drop, stirring continuously, half a gill of 
salad oil, till it is all perfectly smooth and thick ; in a 
separate basin mix half a teaspoonful of mustard flour, 
a saltspoonful of caster sugar, a dust of cayenne or 
coralline pepper, and, lastly, a small tablespoonful of 
good vinegar, and a teaspoonful each of tarragon and 
anchovy vinegar ; now work this all smoothly with two 
or three tablespoonfuls of tomato pulp or purfe, and 
lastly mix it smoothly with the egg, oil, &c. Another 
dressing that answers excellently for these salads is the 
following, sometimes known as " English mayonnaise " : 
Mix together well the yolk of one hard-boiled eg^, a 
teaspoonful of mustard, a quarter of a teaspoonful each 
of salt and pepper, then add in, drop by drop, very 
slowly, sufficient good salad oil to get the mixture as 
thick as custard or butter ; finally adding a teaspoonful 
eaeJi of (Lazenhy's) Harvey sauce, Worceater sauce, chilli.

46 COLD FISH. 

Fisherman s Salad. — Slice six cold boiled potatoes 
(the waxy ones are best for this) ; flake about 1 Jib. of 
any good cold boiled fish, freeing it from any skin or 
bone ; shred the quarter of a nice firm cabbage as for 
cold slaw, and lay these in a salad bowl ; next lay in the 
sliced potato, and lastly the fish. Sprinkle over all this 
a tablespoonful each of minced onions or chives, and 
pickles, dust in a little freshly-ground pepper, finally 
pouring over it all a coffee-cupful of good vinegar and 
one and a half teacupfuls of salad oil. Sieve the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs over the mixture, garnish with 
the whites cut into julienne strips, and serve. 

Sardine Salad, — Break up a well-washed and drained 
lettuce rather small, and put it into a salad bowl, lay 
on this a tomato and cucumber, sliced, and strew over 
it three or four finely-minced spring onions, or an equal 
quantity of minced chives ; pour over it all a cup of 
mayonnaise (either plain or tomato) or a French salad 
dressing. Toss it all well together, sprinkle it with 
minced tarragon and chervil, and garnish with 
quartered hard-boiled eggs, skinned and boned sardines, 
and little bunches of picked and seasoned watercress. 
Another version of this salad (sometimes called a 
Vespagnole) is made thus : Skin and bone as many 
sardines as are necessary, and cut them into neat pieces ; 
put these into a basin with one or more spoonfuls of 
capers (according to quantity), mix it with some finely 
broken-up lettuce, and toss it all till thoroughly 
moistened in a French salad dressing ; then arrange it all 
in a salad bowl, garnishing it with sliced and seasoned 
tomatoes, and stoned olives stuffed with anchovy, green, 
or Glascony butter. 

Herring Salad, — Choose the Dutch pickled herring for 
tills. Fillet and cut up two o! theae hetriivgs, slice down 



MAYONNAISE, VINAIGRETTES, &o. 47 

some cold waxy potatoes, and mix with them six 
washed, boned and minced anchovies, one apple, cored 
and minced, a small cooked beetroot cut into little dice, 
and some pickled onions ; mix it all well with a good 
French salad dressing, and serve garnished with chopped 
hard-boiled egg, capers, minced parsley, and some of 
the beetroot. 

Oyster Salad. — Beard some oysters and blanch them 
in their own liquor (being careful that they do not 
actually boil), then quarter them ; wash a small head 
of celery, shred it into julienne strips, and throw it into 
cold water to crisp it, then drain the celery, mix it with 
the oysters, season it all with pepper, and put it all in some 
white mayonnaise ; pile it up in a glass dish, and mask it 
smoothly with more mayonnaise; garnish with sliced 
hard-boiled egg and caviar, both lightly seasoned with 
oil and lemon juice. The decoration of this salad may 
be varied to taste ; for instance, some people always add 
sliced and seasoned tomato, whilst others again use 
cold cooked celeriac, or salsify, instead of celery. 

Caviar Salad,— This b properly more of a hors 
d'oeuvre than a salad, still for lunch or supper it makes 
a very pretty little dish. Have ready as many small, 
richly-cobured tomatoes as you require, cut off a 
slice from the top, and remove the seeds and core with 
a teaspoon^ press back the flesh of the tomato with 
the bowl of the spoon, and season them inside with 
freshly-ground black pepper and a sprinkle of oil and 
lemon juice ; then set them aside on ice till wanted. 
Now turn out a small pot of Russian caviar (the grey- 
green large-berried kind if procurable is the best), and 
mix it lightly with two tablespoonfuls of oil and one 
of lemon juice, being careful not to crush the caviar. 
Set this also on ice tfll wanted^ xY^ti ^\^^:^n6 '^ ^»»ks«^^!^ 



48 , COLD FISH, 

slice of hard-boiled egg (cut transversely, not length- 
ways) in each tomato, pile on this some of the caviar, 
curl a halved prawn round the top, setting an olive 
farced with anchovy butter on each, and serve. Any 
fisli may be served in this way with the caviar, and 
makes a pretty variety. 

The above will show that there is plenty of variety 
in serving cold boiled fish, but what few cooks appear 
to realise is the use of cold fried fish for this purpose. 
Cold fried smelts may be boned and filletted, and served 
with broken up lettuce, tossed in tomato mayonnaise, 
and garnished with anchovy fillets, hard-boiled and 
quartered egg (plover's or otherwise), chopped aspic, 
&c., according to taste and the material available. 
Cold whitebait again is a thing one seldom sees, yet 
few salads are more dainty than a pile of delicately- 
fried cold whitebait, lightly sprinkled with oil, lemon 
juice or white tarragon vinegar, and coralline pepper, 
surrounded by the hearts of young cabbage lettuce 
(and, for those who like it, a sprinkling of minced 
chives or very tiny " thread " or spring onions), very 
small round radishes, &c., and some white mayonnaise 
handed in a boat. Fish fillets also, if baked or poached, 
seasoned with a little lemon juice, salt, and coralline 
pepper, and pressed till cold between two plates, after 
which they are trimmed, decorated with hard-boiled 
egg, truffle, &c., and masked with aspic jelly, make 
a very pretty border for salad of any kind, especially 
for the Sunday supper above referred to ; the salad 
(which may be fresh, or a mac6doine of cold cooked 
vegetables, or, at a pinch, the contents of a can of mac6- 
doine) being mixed with vinaigrette or mayonnaise 
as you please, and finally set by pouring into the basin 
as much juat liquid aspic as it will hold ; leaving it till 



MAYONNAISE, VINAIGRETTES, &c. 49 

cold and firm, when it may be turned out, and served 
with the fish fillets arranged round it, with little heaps 
of chopped aspic. 

The space at my disposal is far too restricted to allow 
of anything like an exhaustive description of the (liter- 
ally) hundreds of salads, even of fish, which may be 
met with, still the above will give some idea of how 
to procure some change from the everlasting, and often 
" strong," lobster or salmon mayonnaise. But the 
salad-maker should remember that freshness and 
dainty simplicity are the keynotes of success in this 
matter. People are so anxious to make their salads 
" good," as they term it, that they cram every kind 
of ingredient and a heterogeneous assortment of spices 
and sauces into the salad bowl, till nothing but the 
name on the menu enables one to guess the foundation 
of the dish before one. As with everything else, each 
salad should have its own distinct and recognisable 
flavour, enhanced maybe, but never overpowered, 
by judiciously chosen adjuncts. Cold boiled British 
salmon, for instance, calls aloud for lemon juice and 
perhaps a few capers, though connoisseurs are still 
divided whether a vinaigrette should accompany it, 
or a mayonnaise, many averring the latter to be too 
strong a condiment for the native fish, though welcome 
with Dutch or frozen fish. Again, orange (especially 
Seville orange) juice and even a little of the pulp care- 
fully freed from pith and pips, is held a great addition 
to any white fish salad, especially of soles, lemon or 
otherwise, and plaice. Smelts go well with tomato 
and cucumber (few people appear to know how good 
hot tomato sauce is with fried smelts by the way) ; 
mackerel have most flavour if dished with tomato 
mayonnaise, and some finely-imiie^^l^iiXi!^ \<yj^$i^\ss^^^

and filletted herring, especially if from Ijoch Fyne, 
is delicious if served with tartare sauce, seasoned water* 
cress, and, if liked, a dusting of finely-minced chives 
or spring onions. Sardine sauce again is an ideal 
complement to cold halibut, or fish of that class, whilst 
cold salt (or fresh) cod salad with a dressing ^ la Ste. 
M6n6hould is as uncommon as it is good. Only re- 
member, keep your flavours distinct and clear and 
your salad itself as daintily simple as possible. The 
best salad I ever ate was made by a well-known French 
chef, famous for the delicacy of such dishes when he 
prepared them, but I saw that very salad passed over 
by the pupils (it was a class at an exhibition), con- 
temptuously as ** only a lobster salad ! an^^ one can make 
that ! and just a plain thing, without a bit of garnish ! ** 
And they turned admiring and reverent eyes towards 
a weird and awful production, concerning which I 
never was absolutely certain whether it was sweet or 
savoury, or indeed whether it was not the discarded 
hat of one or other of the assistants ! 



CHAPTEE IV. 

MOULDS, CREAMS, Ac. 

Few dishes look prettier than a nicely and daintily 
prepared mould of fish, and this possesses the advantage, 
moreover, of being very economical, using up all sorts 
of scraps, and of really involving but little trouble 
or work. Once a cook has mastered the s^t of making 
aspic jelly, in itself really a most simple process, she 
can produce any number of pretty dishes with the 
remains of last night's dinner ; for instance, if she 
lines any mould, either border or plain, about a quarter 
of an inch thick with aspic jelly, she can fill this with 
any remains of fish, flaked free from skin and bone» 
lightly seasoned with pepper, sc^t, oil, and vinegar, and 
any accessories such as shrimps, prawns, scraps of 
lobster, hard-boiled egg, &c., that she may happen 
to have at hand, tossing the whole lightly in mayon- 
naise of any kind, or, failing this, a little of the just liquid 
aspic ; cover this all with a layer of the plain aspic, and 
put it aside till perfectly set ; it can then be turned out, 
and if a border mould was used, the centre may be 
filled up with seasoned watercress, or any sc^ad to taste 
in season ; if a plain charlotte mould was used, garnish 
the mould round with the salading, and you have a 
very pretty dish out of what might have been an unpro- 
ducible set of scraps. Then a%«ix^ «b?s -^ovjL^as^^nNsScv. 



52 COLD FISH. 

over from the previous day two or three paupiettes 
(rolled fillets) of sole (black or lemon), indeed any 
fish will answer; line some small moulds with aspic 
jelly, halve each paupiette horizontally, set a half in 
each mould, fixing it in place with a little more aspic 
jelly, then cover with a slice of seasoned tomato or 
cucumber, as you please, cover this again with aspic 
jelly, and leave till firm, when you turn out the little 
moulds, and serve them with a garnish of salad, or of 
chopped aspic to taste. Another method of using 
the remains of cold fillets is the following : Choose a 
plain mould, and again line it with aspic jelly ; lay on 
this, in any pretty pattern, the cold fillets (if paupiettes 
slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, if ordinsury 
fillets stamp them out into cutlet shapes, dusting them 
with a little coralline pepper and minced parsley), 
arranging them neatly round the sides and on the top ; 
of course the more daintily this is done the prettier 
will be the result. Set these with sufficient aspic jelly 
to produce an even surface, then chop up all the trim- 
mings of the fish, mixing it with, say, half a pint of 
shelled shrimps, or the flesh of a small lobster, or indeed 
any remains of fish handy may be utilised for this, 
season lightly with pepper and salt, and mix them 
with any good mayonnaise you like (if you have 
any remains of lobster, shrimp, or scallop sauce, stir 
this in the above) ; now pour a little just liquid aspic 
into the mixture, fill the mould up with the latter, and 
put it aside to set. 

Another pretty dish of the same kind is Fifh Custard^ 
made by preparing a savoury custard with the yolks of 
three or four eggs, two gills of the court-bouillon in which 
the fish was cooked, and one gill of milk, seasoning this 
with salt, pepper, and mace to taste, stirring in at the last 



MOULDS, CREAMS, &c. 63 

about loz. of best leaf gelatine, previously dissolved in a 
very little milk or fish stock ; if you wish your dish to be 
extra nice, you will add to this as it cools half a gill or 
more of stiffly-whipped cream. Have ready the cold 
fish, either flaked into neat pieces or stamped out as 
before, together with one hard-boiled egg or so, sliced, 
and about one-third the quantity of shelled shrimps, 
prawns, or lobster roughly minced, as you have of fish ; 
stand the mould, if possible, on ice, and arrange on it a 
pretty pattern with halved prawns or large shrimps, 
sliced cucumber, cold cooked peas, shreds of chilli skin, 
tiny picked sprays of parsley and chervil, in short any 
garnish you please ; now set this very gently with a little 
of the custard, then put in a layer of the fish, strewing 
over it some of the minced shrimps, &c., and again cover 
it with the layer of custard, repeating these two layers 
till the mould is full, being careful to finish with the 
stiflfened custard. Put this aside till set, then turn it out, 
and serve garnished with seasoned watercress and 
tomato salad. This dish may obviously be varied almost 
ad infinitum, according to the ingredients at hand, and 
has the advantage of using up a most miscellaneous and 
mixed variety of fish. Lastly, there are the Fish Creams 
or purees. To three gills of good, strong, strained 
fish stock (this can obviously be made with the court- 
bouillon in which the fish was originally cooked, and in 
which for the purpose you have boiled the bones and 
fish trimmings to further strengthen it), add Joz. of 
dissolved leaf gelatine, mixing this all with lOoz. of any 
nice fish carefully pounded with 4oz. of butter, or a gill 
of thick cream, and season to taste with salt, white 
pepper, and mace ; when this is nearly cold add in a gill 
of cream (if you have not already used cream in the 
mixture), stir it well and poui it. m\;o ^ ^ycl ^2w&:^kNX^ 



54 COLD FISH. 

mould (which may, or may not, have been lined with 
aspic jelly, or chaufroix sauce), mixing with the fish 
as you pack it, seasoned oysters, shelled shrimps, halved 
prawns, shred lobster, or little heaps of caviar, according 
to what you have at hand, being careful, however, always 
to season these addenda lightly with lemon juice and 
white pepper ; leave the mould till perfectly set, turn it 
out, and serve garnished to taste. These recipes, once 
their method of preparation is grasped, are so easy to 
prepare that any cook of average intelligence can vary 
them indefinitely. 

The following will give a good idea of some individual 
methods of preparation : Hake Cream and Irish 
Same {Creme de Merlus a Vlrlandaise). — Flake some cold 
cooked hake, and mix it with horseradish cream. Line a 
border mould with aspic jelly, and fill it with the flaked 
fish. When set, turn it out, and pile up the centre with 
Irish sauce. Horseradish Cream. — Mix well together 
two tablespoonfuls each of double or thick cream and 
of finely-grated horseradish, and half a pint of white 
mayonniase. Irish Sauce. — Mix together a gill each of 
rich green mayonnaise, and of stiffly-whipped cream, 
with a tablespoonf ul of white tarragon vinegar, a dust of 
coralline pepper, and of caster sugar, and, if necessary, a 
drop or two of green vegetable colouring. Now stir 
into this sufficient yoimg carrots, turnips, and cucumbers 
(cut into dice, peas, or slices, and cooked separately) to 
make up a gill measure, and pile up the centre of the 
mould with these. Salmon or trout may be used for 
this dish ; but in this case set the fish in white mayonnaise 
and fill up the centre with iced cucumber cream mixed 
with dice of cooked lobster. For the Cvcumber Cream, 
cook a small cucumber in weak stock, milk, or water, till 
tender enough to pulp through a fine sieve, add to this 



MOULDS, CREAMS, &c. 55 

pur6e a gill of mayonnaise, half a gill of stiffly-whipped 
cream, a tablespoonf ul of white tarragon vinegar, a 
phch of salt, and a dust of caster sugar ; colour with a 
diop or two of vegetable green to make it a faint 
cucumber green shade, and stir into it all just at the last 
tvo tablespoonfuls of just liquid aspic. 

Mousselines de Poisson. — ^These are simply very delicate 
forms of fish cream, but are so pretty and acceptable that 
ic is well to give them. Dissolve ^z. of best leaf gelatine 
h three gills of good clear fish stock, then blend this with 
lOoz. of cold cooked fish, previously pounded till smooth 
with 2oz. or 3oz. of butter, season with salt, coralline, 
and white pepper, a few drops of essence of anchovy, a 
little mace, and a little lemon juice, and when nearly cold 
stir in a gill of whipped cream. Now pack a plain 
charlotte mould with this mixture, place it on ice, or 
in the ice cave, and when wanted turn it out carefully, 
masking with any chaufroix sauce to taste. If pre- 
ferred, when packing it tiny fillets of fish, halved prawns, 
bearded oysters, &c., may be mixed with the cream. Sal- 
mon thus treated and served with a pale green cucumber 
sauce is a particularly pretty dish. So are cold red 
mullet in white wine sauce, or whiting or smelts with a 
delicate mousseline sauce over the mould. In short, 
like most of these dishes, an inteUigent cook can vary 
them to any extent by her resources. 

Red Mullet Cream {Mousseline de Rougets), — Remove 
the heads and gills from lib. of red mullet ; fry a table- 
spoonful of very finely-minced shallot or chives in 3oz. 
or 4oz. of butter, over a slow fire, till they are dry, then 
lay in the mullet, season with coralline pepper, a dust of 
mace, and a Uttle powdered thyme and bay leaf, and fry 
the fish pretty sharply. When cooked tiurn the whole 
out on to a sieve, draining off Ibft W\»\«t wA\v5^^^'»'«»^ 



56 COLD FISH; 

setting this aside on ice to cool. Eub the fish througi 
a sieve to get rid of the bones, &c., and when this purfe 
is quite cold, blend it with the butter and liquor pre- 
viously set aside. Make a pint of rich custard with 
three-quarters of a pint of scalded milk and six egg yolks, 
adding to this, when sufficiently thickened and near^ 
cold, Joz. to loz. of best leaf gelatine, previously dissolve! 
in a Uttle milk ; when this is thoroughly thick, whisl 
the custard, working into it as you do so the poundec 
fish, and before it sets add in Ughtly about half a gill ol 
stiffly-whipped cream^ pour it all into a mouldy and set 
it aside on ice for a couple of hours at least ; then turn out 
and serve garnished with chopped aspic. 

Whiting Cream (Mousseline de Merlan), — ^This may be 
made precisely as above (but of course the fish in this case 
must be cleaned), only omitting the herbs, and seasoning 
the fish v^ith minced parsley, mace, coralline pepper, and, 
if at hand, some minced mushroom. Instead of the 
custard, you can use the cold Hollandaise sauce, stiflFened 
with gelatine, and serve garnished with watercress and 
tomato salad. This cream is particularly delicate if made 
with smelts. In any case, a few drops of essence of 
anchovy should be added to the sauce. 

Wkiting and Oyster Cream (Crdme de Merlan en 
Surprise). — ^Prepare a whiting cream according to the 
directions given for fish cream in the beginning of this 
chapter ; line a plain mould with aspic cream, about one- 
third of an inch thick, and fill this with the whiting 
cream. With a large spoon scoop out a hollow in the 
centre of this mass, and fill up this cavity with bearded 
and seasoned oysters, tossed in mayonnaise aspic, cover 
this smoothly with some of the fish cream, previously 
removed, and put it all aside to set ; then turn it out, 
and serve garniabed with watercress and tomato salad. 



MOULDS. CREAMS, &c. 57 

Lobster, ciab, aralir^. prawns, shiinips, kc^ may aU be 
used for the fifllmg, as jou pkase. 

LobMer Cnam {Bomard a la C^esle).— Have ready 
some sdfflj-wfaqiped cream* dligfatly flaromed with 
essence of an^diOTy and coralline pepper, also a lobster 
cut up into small dice : season with oil, vinegar, salt, 
and pepper, and incorporate a third of this with suffi- 
cient a^ie jelly, inevioaaly whipped to a stiff froth, {Hie 
this np on a ^as& or ^ver dish, mix the rest of the 
lobster with stiffly-whipped cream, and pile it all over 
the heap of lobster aspic, as rockily as you can, dust 
lightly with coralline pepper and minced tarragon, and 
serve garnished with a bouquet of tarragon sprays, and 
the lobster feelers inserted at the top. 

Souffle Glace, of Fish. — This is a nice and easily- 
prepared dish. Have ready some good mayonnaise 
of any kind or colour (this may be varied to suit the 
fish used), some aspic whipped to a stiff froth, but not 
quite set, and any fish handy, freed from skin and 
bone and nicely flaked. Have ready a souffle dish 
with a two inch band of paper firmly set round it, 
and put at the bottom of it a layer of the whipped aspic, 
then a layer of the fish seasoned with oil, vinegar, a little 
freshly ground black pepper, and salt ; cover this with 
a thin coating of mayonnaise, or cucumber, tomato, 
or cold Dutch sauce, as you please, and continue these 
three layers till the dish is full right up to the top of 
the paper, finishing with a rocky layer of the whipped 
aspic ; put this aside till firm, then remove the paper 
band, fasten a napkin neatly round the dish, and serve 
lightly dusted with finely-minced parsley and coralline 
pepper. If liked, some cold boiled rice may be stirred 
into a rich curry sauce, and used instead of the mayon- 
naise. 



68 COLD FISH. 

Crah SouffiS, — This is delicious if you whisk one and 
a half gills of just liquid aspic till white and creamy, 
then mix into it three-quarters of a pint of stiffly-whipped 
cream, a tablespoonf ul of white tarragon vinegar, 
a tiny pinch of salt, and a good dust of coralline pepper ; 
now stir into this Jib. of finely-minced crab, and about 
a teaspoonful of finely-minced parsley, and chives, 
chervil, or tarragon (according to what you have), and 
fill up a papered souffle mould (the paper should rise 
Ij inches to 2 inches above the case) with this mixture ; 
stand it on ice, or in the ice cave, for an hour or so, then 
remove the paper, and serve with minced parsley and 
a tiny rose of stiffly-whipped cream, flavoured with 
a drop or two of essence of anchovy and tarragon 
vinegar, and a dust of coralline pepper. 

Curry SouffiS {Souffle de Poisson a VIndienne). — 
Peel, slice, and fry four onions with a pinch of finely 
minced bayleaf and thyme in 2oz. of butter for twelve 
to fifteen minutes ; then fry in the same pan a tea- 
spoonful of good curry powder for a minute or so, 
after which add two raw ripe tomatoes, a good dust 
of coralline pepper, a dessertspoonful of tamarind, a 
few drops of lemon juice, a tablespoonful of grated 
cocoanut, six boned and washed anchovies, and a pint of 
good fish stock. Simmer this till tender, then dissolve 
in it loz. of best leaf gelatine, tammy and sieve it, and, 
when nearly cold, stir in to it ^Ib. of the fish, a spoonful 
or two of roughly chopped hard-boiled eggs, and two 
tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Have ready some 
small souffle cases duly papered with white paper, and 
fill these with the curry mixture. Set them in a cold 
place or on ice for about an hour, then remove the paper 
bands, force out a tiny rose of anchovy cream on each, 
smd serve garnished, if liked, with little heaps of cold 



MOULDS, CREAMS, &c. 59 

boiled rice. This can manifestly be prepared with 
any cold cooked fish, but is specially good with salt 
fish, if duly soaked. For the Anchovy Cream pound 
six well-washed and boned anchovies with the yolk 
of a hard-boiled egg, a tablespoonful of salad oil, and 
a dust of coralline pepper ; when this is quite smooth 
add half a gill of liquid aspic jelly, and sieve it all, mixing 
it then with a gill of stiffly-whipped cream, and leave 
it on ice till wanted. This is a particularly good garnish 
for many kinds of fish. 

Salmon Souffle, — Pound 8oz. or lOoz. of cold cooked 
salmon with the hard-boiled yolks of two eggs, and a 
few drops of lemon juice, seasoning it with white pepper, 
salt, and a few drops of essence of anchovy ; moisten 
this with a gill of good fish stock in which you have 
previously dissolved ioz. of leaf gelatine, then sieve 
it all, and mix it quickly with half a pint of stiffly-whipped 
cream, flavoured with essence of anchovy and tinted 
faintly with a drop or two of liquid carmine. Pack 
it all in a papered souffle dish, and put it aside till set. 
If you omit the gelatine and put the mixtuj'e into little 
papered souffl6 cases, they may be frozen or frappes^ 
and make most delicious little iced souffle. 

Sole Ristori, — Line a plain or charbtte mould with 
jelly, decorating this with truffle, hard-boiled egg white, 
and picked sprays of chervil. Set this garnish with 
a little more jelly, then arrange round the sides and 
bottom fillets of sole (previously cooked in white wine — 
an vin Uanc — and stamped out into even, heart or 
kite shapes), setting these also with more aspic, and 
then fill up the centre with a lobster cream (prepared 
as described in the beginning of this chapter), cover 
with jelly, and leave till set. Have ready either some 
small tomatoes (seeded), or some artichoke bottoms, 



60 COLD FISH. 

seasoning either with oil, tarragon vinegar, pepper and 
salt, and pile up on these the trimmings of the sole, 
and some lobster, with a few fillets of washed and boned 
anchovy tossed in some mayonnaise, strew these with 
minced olives, and arrange round the mould alternately 
with little heaps of chopped aspic. 

The sole fillets should when cooked be pressed between 
two plates till quite cold. 

Carp Mould (Pain de Carpe a VAlenQon.) — Braise 
a medium-sized carp in some good strong fish stock, 
or rich court-bouillon, on a bed of sliced soup vegeta- 
bles, till perfectly cooked, then remove all skin and 
bones, and pound the flesh with two anchovies boned 
and filletted, and two or three truffles if at hand (these 
are not indispensable), moistening this as you pound 
it with a gill or so of velout^ sauce, to which you have 
added the liquor from the fish. Kub this all through 
a sieve, add to it one and a half gills of savoury or aspic 
(fish) jelly as you please, and sufficient good tarragon 
vinegar to flavour it to taste. Meantime, prepare a 
mac6doine of pickled gherkins and button mushrooms, 
crayfish tails (prawns or shrimps), cut into dice, and some 
bearded and blanched oysters, mixing all these ingredients 
well together, and tossing them in some mayonnaise 
aspic, line a mould with good clear jelly, and when 
this is fairly set put in a quarter of the fish pur6e, 
previously stirred over ice till perfectly smooth, smooth 
it^over, and cover with a layer of the mac6doine, repeat- 
ing these two layers till the mould is full, and put it away 
to set. When wanted dip the mould in hot water, turn 
out the mould, and serve garnished with chopped jelly 
and little biscuit-crisp croutons thickly spread with green, 
Gascony, or anchovy butter to taste. This dish, which 
is excellent, is very good if made with bream, hake, &c.

the side of the mould ; force out a little heap of chopped 
jelly on the top, fixing this in place with a silver skewer 
(if available, or use a new steel one), on which you 
may, if you like, thread an unshelled prawn and a 
truffle, then arrange round it the rest of the eel slices, 
fixing them as before with the chopped aspic, and 
serve. For the verUpri mayonnaise aspic mix three large 
tablespoonfuls of green or vert-pr6 mayonnaise with 
half a pint of just liquid aspic, and use when setting. 

Chaufroix of Lobster or Salmon, — Slice the bodies or 
tails of two lobsters neatly and diagonally (or flake a nice 
piece of cold cooked salmon in the same way), marinade 
them for two or three hours in oil, vinegar, &c., then 
mask each thickly and smoothly with mayonnaise aspic. 
Meanwhile, line a border mould with jelly, and, when this 
is firm, lay in little heaps of the minced trimmings of the 
lobster, and of thinly-sliced gherkins, arranging round 
these strips of white of egg as a garnish ; then pour 
in a layer of jelly, and repeat these two layers till the 
mould is full. Put it aside to set. When wanted, dip 
the mould in hot water and turn out the jelly sharply. 
Arrange the slices of lobster, &c., on the top of the mould 
in a circle, fixing them with chopped aspic, by means of a 
bag and plain pipe, and fill up the centre with a cold 
macMoine of cooked vegetables tossed in a French 
salad dressing. The contents of a tin of vegetable 
mac6doine, if nicely drained, answers capitally for this 
dish. Any fish may be served thus, varying the 



Salmon Timbale (Timbale de Saumon d la Romaine), — 

Line a timbale mould with jelly, then put in a layer of 

half lobster, half tomato sauce, mixed, and stififened with 

gelatine ; now put in a thick layer of cold salmon flaked 

finely and mixed with minced anchovies, mayonnaise 



MOULDS, CREAMS, Ac. «3 

aspic, and two or three spoonfuls of whipped cream. 
Cover this with a layer of the lohster and tomato sauce, 
and leave till set, when you turn it out and serve gar- 
nished with chopped aspic, or halved cabhage lettuces. 

Lobster Cream^ Iced (Mousse de Homard Glacee). — 
Split the shell of a freshly-cooked lobster, and mince it 
very fine ; stir this mince over the fire in a gill of b^ 
chamel sauce, then add to this a gill of jelly in which you 
have previously dissolved two leaves or so of best leaf 
gelatine, and stir it all together until well blended, and the 
gelatine perfectly dissolved, without, however, letting it 
boil ; season this to taste, and pour it all into a basin to cool ; 
whisk one and a half gills of double cream till stiff, mix it 
lightly and quickly with a gill of tomato mayonnaise, and 
stir this gently into the mixture in the basin. Have ready 
a properly-papered souffle mould, and fill it with the 
mixture, then set it in a charged ice cave, and leave it till 
frozen firm ; when you lift it out, remove the paper band, 
sprinkle the top with finely-minced parsley and coralline 
pepper, and serve. This should be quite firm and icy 
cold, but not absolutely frozen hard. Salmon may be 
prepared in the same way. 

Timbale de Poisson en Aspic. — Cook some nice fillets 
of any white fish en paupiettes, and leave these till 
perfectly cold, pressing them lightly between two plates 
with a light weight on top ; when set, slice these neatly 
into little rounds, line a plain charlotte mould with 
aspic, then decorate with the little rounds of fish, adding 
some coralline pepper and a little minced parsley, 
fixing this with another layer of jelly. When this is 
firm, but not quite hard, fill up the centre with minced 
prawns, shrimps, or lobster, either tossed in a French 
salad dressing, or in mayonnaise, as you please. Serve 
garnished with any salad to taste. T\»& Sa ^ :^^^ ^-^ns^ 



64, COLD FISH. 

and by no means expensive dish, as fillets of plaice 
or lemon sole answer quite as well as more expensive 
fish. 

Fish, Chartreuse of, — Fillet a good sole, &c., and cook 
the fillets in a well buttered baking tin, with lemon juice, 
salt, and pepper, imder a buttered paper, for six to eight 
minutes; then take up, and place them between two 
plates, lightly weighted, to press till cold. Now stamp 
them out with a round cutter, garnishing half with 
lobster coral or coralline pepper, and the other half with 
minced parsley and sieved hard-boiled egg, setting this 
with a drop or two of just liquid aspic. Line a plain 
charlotte mould with aspic, and arrange the rounds of 
sole all over the sides and top, adding tiny bunches of 
picked chervil, and a dust of coralline pepper, if liked, 
between the garnish, setting this with more aspic jelly. 
Now mince the remains of the fish, and mix it with about 
a cupful of picked and minced shrimps or lobster, four 
(canned and well rinsed) artichoke bottoms, and two 
peeled tomatoes, cut into small dice, and, lastly, twelve 
small raw oysters ; season to taste with coralline pepper 
and salt, &c., and mix it all with half a pint of aspic jelly 
and half a gill of good mayonnaise, stirring it well 
together over ice till it is just beginning to set, when it 
ijiust be poured into the mould, and left on ice or in a 
cool place till firm, when it should be turned out and 
served garnished with chopped aspic, and a tomato and 
watercress (or any other) salad to taste. It is not 
necessary to use sole for this dish, as neat httle fillets 
of whiting, &c., may be used in the same way ; only 
remember in that case to point each row of fillets 
the opposite iway. This is a most economical dish, 
as any scraps of fish, sauce, &c., may be used in its 
composition. 



MOULDS, CREAMS, &c. 65 

Eel Chartreuse. — Kill and clean carefully a 2lb. eel, 
removing the bones ; rub the inside well with pepper, 
salt, and minced parsley, and tie the fish up in a piece of 
muslin. Put it in a pan with the head and bones, with 
a bouquet garni, two slices of onion, a slice of lemon cut 
straight through pith and peel, with sufficient water 
to cover this all well ; bring it gently to the boil, and 
simmer till done. It will take from thirty to forty-five 
minutes, according to the thickness of the eel. As soon 
as it is cooked lift out the latter, and remove the muslin. 
Skin the fish neatly, then set it aside. Meanwhile boil 
up the liquor sharply to reduce it, strain it, and add to it 
a pint of rather stiff aspic (2oz. of gelatine to the quart) ; 
whisk lightly together the white and broken shell of an 
egg, and mix this with the stock, aspic, &c., bring it all 
to the boil, stirring it all the time (stopping just before 
it actually boils up), then draw the pan to the side, 
and let it stand for eight or ten minutes, after which 
you strain it through a jelly bag. Now line a plain 
mould with this jelly, just as it is setting decorating the 
sides and base of the mould with sliced hard-boile I 
egg and picked shrimps ; then fill up the mould with 
alternate layers of eel, and shrimps, and hard-boiled 
egg, setting each layer with a little jelly, and finishing 
with the jelly, being careful to have each layer well set 
(though not absolutely hard) before adding the next. 
Turn out when firm, and serve garnished with seasoned 
watercress and any nice cold sauce to taste, or serve 
plain. 

Oyster Blancmange. — Make a blancmange in the 
usual way, only use salt and the. oyster hquor instead 
of sugar. Decorate a mould with caviar and lobster 
coral and pour in some of the savoury blancmange, 
then add a layer of fresh oysters spriivkkd ^'^Js^ ^^^isi^ 



66 COLD FISH. 

caviar and lemon juice, and repeat these layers till 
the mould is filled, the blancmange being the last. 
Leave it on ice till set, then turn it out, and serve gar- 
nished with chopped aspic, caviar, and prawns if at 
hand. (Oysters with mousseline sauce are equally good 
this way.) 

Truites en Turban aux Concombres, — Fillet neatly 
some small trout, removing the skin and bones, but 
keeping the fillets as whole as possible, dust half of them 
with parsley, and half with lobster coral or coralline 
pepper ; line a plain Charlotte mould with aspic, and fix 
the trout fillets all round, setting them with a Uttle more 
jelly, as if they were Savoy biscuits for a Charlotte Busse. 
Cover this with a rich lobster farce pretty thickly, 
set it with more aspic, and fill up the centre with 
cucumber sliced or cut into balls, and tossed in mayon- 
naise aspic. The lobster farce is really chopped finely, 
seasoned to taste with coralline pepper, minced parsley, 
and chives if liked, and lightly mixed with a little 
mayonnaise, to which you add sufficient aspic jelly 
to stiffen it. 

Pike Cheese {Pain de Brocket). — Remove the fillets 
from a fair-sized pike, and free them from skin and 
bone, then pound this flesh in the mortar with half 
the quantity of butter (if an ounce of two of this is 
crayfish or lobster butter, all the better), seasoning 
it, as you pound, with white and red pepper, salt, and 
a few drops of essence of anchovy ; then rub it all through 
a fine sieve into a basin, and stir the pur6e together 
for a few minutes. Now mix in tlie stiffly-whipped 
white of an egg, twice the quantity of stiffly-whipped 
cream, and joz. to loz. of leaf gelatine dissolved in a 
little milk. Fill a buttered mould or basin with this 
farce, and steam or poach it under a buttered paper, 



MOULDS, CREAMS, &c. 67 

and when cooked, set it aside till cold, when you turn 
it out, and serve masked with any nice chaufroix sauce 
to taste ; with a garnish of seasoned watercress, tomato, 
or other salading, quartered hard-boiled eggs, crayfish 
tails, lobster, &c., according to the colour of the masking 
sauce. Of course truffles may be added to the farce, and 
prawns, caviar, &c.,used in the garnish, but they are 
not indispensable. Hake, halibut, sturgeon, &c., are 
all good served by this recipe.

CHAPTER V. 

SMALL ENTE^ES, &c. 

Of small fish entries there is a very large choice, though 
as a matter of fact one seldom sees them save in the 
case of oyster or lobster patties, or occasionally, lobster 
or salmon cutlets. Yet small dishes of fish may be 
made out of the veriest scraps, and still be both tempting 
and satisfactory. For instance, say you have a little 
cod left over from last night's dinner, with perhaps 
a scant ladleful of the sauce that accompanied it to 
table ; flake the fish as small as possible, free from skin 
and bone, stir a little, rather thick, mayonnaise into 
the sauce, and put a layer of this at the bottom of some 
little cases, either china or paper ; then pile the flaked 
cod on this, dusting it lightly with freshly-ground 
black pepper, and a very little lemon juice, and when 
it is a neat dome shape, mask it with mayonnaise sauce, 
crowning this with either a fillet of anchovy or a little 
tuft of scraped horseradish. If you have such things 
handy, artichoke bottoms well drained and seasoned 
with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, will replace the 
cases advantageously. Or Su6doise sauce may be used 
instead of the oyster and mayonnaise sauce, or tomato 
sauce is also good. 
Soles and other delicate fish are equally good, cut 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 69 

up small and treated as above ; or again small dariole 
moulds may be lined with aspic, and filled up with a 
mince of cold fish mixed with aspic jelly whipped to a 
fijoth, or stiffly-whisked cream, or any nice sauce to 
taste, a little just liquid aspic being then poured over 
it all, and the moulds put away till quite set, when 
they may be turned out, and served garnished with 
seasoned watercress, mustard and cress, or chopped 
aspic, as you please. Tomatoes, seeded and deprived 
of their extra moisture by pressing the inside with 
the bowl of a silver spoon, seasoning the inside with 
oil, flavoured vinegar, freshly-ground black pepper, 
and salt, may also be filled up with flaked seasoned fish, 
and fresh or cooked salad tossed in mayonnaise. Aspic 
(as will be seen in the final chapter) is anything but an 
expensive luxury, and is a great help to economy, as 
by its help all sorts of odds and ends may be utilised. 
For instance, for the tomatoes described above, in 
winter take any cooked vegetables, such as celeriac, 
Brussels sprouts, carrot, beetroot, &c., cut into dice, 
with any scraps of flaked fish, fresh or salt (flaked bloater, 
kipper. Finnan haddie, &c., answer excellently), and 
mix them lightly with just liquid aspic jelly; pile 
this up in a dome shape in the tomatoes, crowning 
the apex with a stuffed olive or an anchovy fillet, and 
serve when set. ♦ 

Tiny souffles glacis again are very easy to make. 
Paper some small paper or china souffl6 cases with an 
inch and a half wide band of paper, and lay a spoonful 
of flaked or minced fish in each, seasoning this with 
oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, then cover with a layer 
of sauce to taste, stiffening this with aspic, then another 
layer of fish, more sauce, and so on imtil the case is full, 
and pile on each lightly a teaapootilvii o\ ^J«^ ^>& 



70 COLD FISH. 

whipped to a stiff froth. The sauce used for this is 
easily prepared by adding half a gill (four good table- 
spoonfuls) of any sauce to taste to one-third of a pint 
of aspic jelly, mixing them well together, and adding 
any further seasoning or flavouring to taste as you 
mix. A rich form of this sauce, usually called a *' mous- 
seline," is made by blending together equal quantities 
of sauce, aspic, and cream, the two last being whisked 
to a stiff froth. 

Again, small cold fish, whether fried in egg and bread- 
crumbs, or plainly boiled, make a neat little dish as 
filets de poisson en aspicy thus : Eemove the heads 
and tails from some cold fried smelts (or small fillets 
of sole may be used in the same way), pile them up 
neatly on a dish, garnish round with any salading 
to taste, and pour over them either tomato cream or 
tomato mayonnaise, and serve. If it is boiled fish 
you have, trim them into neat fillets, and mask them 
with a mayonnaise aspic or jellynstiffened sauce to taste, 
and when this is firm, brush them over lightly with 
just liquid jelly to glaze it, dish them neatly in a circle 
when set, and fill up the centre with seasoned water- 
cress, small cress, &c., to taste. 

The following recipes will give a good idea of the 
variety of such dishes : Filets de Saumon en Chaufroix 
Alexandra. — Cut some cold salmon into neat fillets 
or slices, and mask them with aspic or savoury jeUy. 
When this is set, dish these in a circle alternately with 
fleurons of anchovy or cheese pastry cut to match the 
fish, garnish with fresh salad, and serve with a green 
mousseline sauce in the centre (i.e., equal parts of 
green mayonnaise, whipped cream, and aspic jelly). 

Cotelettes de Saumon aux Tomates, — Prepare some 
salmon cutlets with a good saYmon iQi^s^OL^^t, egg 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 71 

and crumb them, and fry in hot fat till of a delicate 
golden brown, drain them well on blotting paper, and 
leave them till perfectly cold. Meanwhile, mix together 
a gill of richly-coloured tomato sauce and half a pint 
of aspic jelly in which you have previously dissolved 
five or six sheets of best leaf gelatine, and pour it on 
to a very clean tin or large dish, in a layer nearly half an 
inch thick, and leave till set. When firm, cut out 
shapes to match the fish cutlets, and dish the two 
alternately, in a circle, filling the centre either with 
chopped aspic or with the following : Cut Jib. of potatoes 
with a cutter into little pea shapes, put these on in 
cold water, bring this to the boil, then strain off the 
potato peas, rinse them in cold water, and cook them 
in boiling salted water till tender, being careful that 
they do not break or get mashed. When cooked drain 
them off, and leave till cold, when you toss them lightly 
in two tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise sauce, strew them 
with minced tarragon and chervil, and pile it all in 
the centre of the salmon cutlets. 

Petits Pains de Saumon a la Russe. — Prepare a nice 
forcemeat of salmon, and poach it in little plain dariole 
moulds. Turn out when cold, mask each with mayon- 
naise aspic, and, when set, dish with a good spoonful 
of horseradish or Su^doise sauce (as you please) on the 
top of each, and garnish to taste with rasped horse- 
radish, seasoned watercress, or chopped aspic. 

Petits Aspics de Sole aux Anchois, — Fillet two soles, 
bat them out, and trim them to the size desired ; then 
spread one side with a d'uxelle mixture (minced parsley, 
chives, and mushrooms, seasoned, and tossed in butter), 
roll up each fillet, and fasten it into shape with a band 
of buttered paper. Bake these rolled fillets in a well- 
buttered baking tin, seasoned \j\l\v a. l^^ ^\q^'s> ^\\b\siRi^ 



72 COLD FISH. 

juice, wine, and coralline pepper, under a buttered paper. 
When ready, lift them out and leave till cold. Now 
line some little bombe or plain dariole moulds with jelly, 
garnishing the sides with a dust of coralline pepper and 
tiny sprays of chervil (this is not indispensable though 
pretty), set these with a little more jelly ; then place a 
fillet in each mould (after removing the buttered paper 
and trimming them), fill up the latter with jelly, and 
put aside to set. When dished, force a little rose of 
anchovy cream out on each, and serve garnished to 
taste. For the anchovy cream, wash and bone three or 
four anchovies, or use the same amount of anchovy 
paste, and pound it up with a dessertspoonful of good 
oil, a dust of coralline pepper, and a drop of carmine ; 
then work in two tablespoonfuls of just liquid jelly, 
finally mixing it with half a gill of very stiffly-whipped 
cream. Use icy-cold. 

Darioles de Poisson a la Crdme, — Mince roughly any 
remains of cold fish, of one or several kinds as most 
convenient, season it lightly with oil and vinegar and a 
dust of coralline pepper ; stand on ice till wanted. Now 
line some little bombe or plain dariole moulds with 
aspic cream (mix together half a pint liquid aspic jelly, 
a gill of thick, fresh cream, and a dessertspoonful of 
tarragon vinegar, and use when cooling), this lining 
should be a quarter of an inch thick. When this is set, 
toss the minced fish, with minced fillets of anchovy, 
capers, and olives, in some mayonnaise, and fill the 
moulds with this, covering them with more of the aspic 
cream, and serve with, or without, a tomato salad. A 
particularly dainty dish may be made in this way, 
called Petites crimes d'huitres au caviar. For this 
prepare the aspic cream as before, only use strained 
oyster liquor instead of tarragoiv*, chop lightly some 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 73 

bearded oysters, and mix them and little heaps of caviar 
with white mayonnaise, add a dust of coralline pepper 
and a few drops of lemon juice. Fill the moulds as 
before, and serve with crisp shred celery tossed in 
mayonnaise, to which some cooks add peeled, chopped 
walnuts. This dish is not of the " elegant economy " 
order, I admit, but is bad to beat as a pretty entr6e for a 
smart dinner or a ball supper. 

Timhallettes de sole a la Cardinale. — Fillet as many 
soles as you need, and halve each fillet, season each 
lightly with salt and white pepper, and roll each round 
a piece of carrot, fastening it into shape with a buttered 
paper. Bake ten to twelve minutes in a well-buttered 
baking dish, seasoning the fillets with pepper, salt, 
lemon juice, and if liked, a few drops of wine, and cover- 
ing them with a buttered paper. When cooked lift them 
out and leave till cold. Prepare half a pint of rich 
lobster sauce, and divide it in half ; to one half add five or 
six sheets of best leaf gelatine to stifiFen it nicely, and 
with this fill the fish fillets when cold and the buttered 
paper and the carrots have been removed, and let them 
stand till set. Meanwhile, to the other gill of lobster 
sauce add a good dust of coralline pepper, a gill of stiffly- 
whipped cream, two tablespoonfuls of thick mayon- 
naise, five or six boned and washed anchovies sieved, 
with a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and two 
tablespoonfuls of minced lobster (failing this use prawns 
or shrimps), with a drop or two of carmine to bring the 
colour to a pretty soft pink. Have the fillets set in aspic 
jelly in Httle plain moulds, then turn these out and 
arrange in a circle, filling up the centre with the lobster 
sauce. K Hked, a jelly border improves this dish

74 COLD FISH. 

when set, dish the fish on it, and pile the sauce up in 
the centre. 

Little Salmon Souffles {cold), — These are made thus : — 
Pound 8oz. or so of cold cooked salmon, very smoothly, 
with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a few drops of 
lemon juice, a drop or two of essence of anchovy, with 
salt and white and coralline pepper to taste ; moisten this 
all with a gill of stock in which you have dissolved Joz. 
of gelatine, sieve it all, then stir into it lightly half a 
pint of stiffly-whipped cream, flavoured with anchovy 
essence and coralline pepper, and, if necessary, coloured 
with a drop or so of carmine to bring it all to a delicate 
pink. Have ready some little paper souffle cases, fill 
them with the mixture, and set them in the ice cave 
for an hour or so. These can be served without icing, 
if instead of Joz. gelatine you dissolve nearly Joz. in the 
stock. Eemove the paper before serving. Any nice 
fish may be served thus, especially if essence of anchovy 
be added to the mixture. 

Iced Salmon Souffle^ — Mince finely lib. cold cooked 
salmon, and mix it with a pint of stiffly-whisked aspic 
(whisked while cooling), then stir in lightly half a pint 
whipped cream ; season with a teaspoonful of French 
and English mustard (mixed), a dust of salt and of 
coralline pepper, and a full tablespoonful of Worcester 
sauce ; add if necessary a drop or two of carmine to 
make it a delicate pink, and a teaspoonful of anchovy 
essence. Put this into a bag with a large plain pipe, 
fill some little paper souffle cases with it, and leave these 
in the charged ice cave till set. When required, remove 
the paper, press out on each a rose of stiffly-whipped 
cream, seasoned with coralline pepper and raw minced 
parsley, and dish with half a plover's egg between each 
h'ttJe case, or, failing this, some chopped aspic. 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 75 

Iced and Devilled Lobster Souffles. — Dissolve a tea- 
spoonful of Lemco and Joz. of best leaf gelatine in a pint 
of hot, rich espagnole sauce ; add to this a full wineglass- 
ful of sherry, two tablespoonfuls of Worcester sauce, a 
teaspoonful of French mustard, and a good dust of 
cayenne. Pound the flesh of a cooked and minced 
lobster with six anchovies and a little thick cream ; 
mix it with the previous ingredients, and rub it aU 
through a fine sieve. When cool, mix in lightly a gill 
of very stiffly-whisked cream. Paper some small souffle 
cases and lay in some pieces of lobster seasoned with 
cayenne pepper, chilli vinegar, oil, and a Httle Worcester 
sauce (or chutney, if liked) ; now fill up with the lobster 
mixture by means of a bag and pipe, and place these 
little souffle in the charged ice cave for at least an hour ; 
then serve dusted with finely-minced parsley. This is 
very good made of tinned or canned lobster. 

Petites Mousses de Homard. — Dissolve two or three 
sheets of best leaf gelatine in a gill of aspic jelly, and stir 
it into a gill of creamy bechamel, with the finely-minced 
flesh of a lobster, and leave it to cool. Whip one and a 
half gills of cream to a stiff froth, then mix it well with 
a gill of tomato mayonnaise, and, lastly, stir this all 
gently into the lobster, aspic, &c. Have ready some 
little paper souffle cases, fill them with the mixture, 
and stand these in the charged ice cave for an hour or so. 
To serve, remove the papers, and dust Hghtly with 
minced tarragon and coralline pepper. 

Trout en Turban, — Have ready some cold cooked 
fillets of trout, and dust half with lobster coral and half 
with minced parsley ; fix these with aspic, or fish jelly, 
round a jelly-lined Charlotte mould, as if they were 
Savoy biscuits ; then cover them quickly inside with a 
cold farce of minced lobster, axii ^ \r^ Ni^as. oks^^s^ ^^is^ 



76 GOLD FISH. 

sliced and seasoned cucumber tossed in some rich mayon- 
naise ; cover this all with jelly, and leave it till set, 
when it is turned out, and serve garnished with chopped 
jelly, or seasoned watercress to taste. Any fish fillets 
may be served thus, varying the farce and the centre. 

Filleted Sole is also good cold. Trim the fillets neatly, 
season them with a little salt and white pepper, put 
them in a well-buttered baking dish with a little lemon 
juice, covered with buttered paper, and cook in the 
oven for eight to ten minutes ; then lift them out, 
lay them on a plate, turn another over them, weight 
this lightly, and leave till perfectly cold. They can 
then be cut to any shape liked, and masked with any 
sauce to taste. For instance, if coated with gelatined 
tomato sauce and served round a watercress salad, 
with a garnish of chopped parsley, anchovy, and sieved 
hard-boiled Qggy they are called Filets de Sole, Bokim- 
ienne; if previous to cooking they are rolled round 
a piece of potato or carrot cut in the shape of a cork, 
and tied up in a strip of buttered paper, cooked, and freed 
when cold from the potato and the paper, then masked 
with Dutch sauce (stiffened with a little gelatine), 
filled up when this is set with a rich lobster sauce, and 
served garnished with chopped aspic, tarragon, and 
chervil, they are known as Filets de Sole en Chaufroixy 
Dauphine. Or the fillets may be rolled up, fixed into 
shape with a band of buttered paper, and either cooked 
in the oven with a little white wine and a buttered paper 
over them, or gently simmered till done in milk and 
fish stock, then left till cold, when they are neatly 
trimmed. Now line a plain Charlotte mould with 
aspic jelly, and arrange the little rolls of sole all round 
this, slicing one round to decorate the bottom (which 
wi7/ be the top) of the mould ; put a praYfii,or two atoned

garnished with anchovy fillets, shrimps, picked veget- 
ables, &c., to taste. 

Clam Cocktail. — Place twelve opened clams in a 
basin with their liquor, and when this has settled well, 
pour it off carefully into another bowl, free from all 
shell and sediment, and set this basin on iqe. Mean- 
while, add to the clam liquor enough mushroom or 
tomato catsup to fill four claret glasses altogether, 
with a small teaspoonful of finely-grated horseradish, 
three or four drops of Tabasco, a tablespoonful of vinegar 
(plain or flavoured) or lemon juice, and the iced clams. 
Mix lightly and serve very cold. Oyster cocktail may 
also be made in the same way, only omitting the horse- 
radish, and using one part Worcester sauce to two 
parts of catsup. 

Oyster Cocktail, — Choose very small oysters, drain 
off and strain their liquor, rinsing them well in this to 
free them from any bits of shell. Have ready the follow- 
ing sauce : Mix together two tablespoonfuls each of 
lemon juice and tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of Wor- 
cester sauce, ten drops of Tabasco, and a dust of salt. 
(This will make sauce enough for six persons.) The 
oysters should have stood on ice till the sauce is ready, 
then when quite cold (but not frozen), put from four 
to six into each glass and pour over these some spoonfuls 
of the dressing and serve. These cocktails are much 
liked in America for lunch, or supper parties, and are 
also sometimes used amongst the hors d'oeuvre, or 
zakouska, as the Russians term this service. To this 
class belongs the well-known " prairie oyster," said 
to have been invented by a plainsman of the Wild 
West for the benefit of a sick comrade, who believed 
only an oyster would enable him to shake off the fever 
tAat was killing him. This "oyster" is prepared by 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 79 

putting a teaspoonful of good vinegar, or Worcester 
sauce, at the bottom of a wineglass, and slipping into 
this very carefully the unbroken yolk of a raw egg^ 
dusting this with salt and a little freshly-ground black 
pepper. It must be added that this may be varied 
to taste, some persons adding a drop or two of Tabasco 
or a little cayenne to the vinegar, whilst others, horresco 
referens ! sophisticate this temperance '* pick-me-up " 
by using old rye whisky, instead of vinegar or sauce ; 
but this is not approved by connoisseurs. 

Poisson a V Amphytrion. — Flake up any cold fish 
(the more delicate the better, cold John Dorey is especi- 
ally good thus) rather small, then toss it carefully in 
verte or ravigotte mayonnaise till every flake is nicely 
covered, and pile it up on a glass dish ; set this on ice 
for at least two hours before it is wanted, then serve 
garnished with chopped aspic and tomato or cucumber 
salad. With the latter it is prettier to mix the fish 
with tomato mayonnaise. 

Fish Sandwiches. — Spread some Hovis or sandwich 
bread with either egg, Gascony, or maitre d 'hotel butter, 
and lay on these slices either minced or flaked cold fish, 
seasoned with salt and white pepper ; spread an equal 
number of slices of bread with a stiff mayonnaise, or 
mayonnaise aspic, lay very thinly sliced cucumber 
or tomato on this, press the two sets of slices together 
lightly, trim them into shape, and serve garnished 
with cress of any kind. These may be prepared some- 
time beforehand if when ready they are packed one 
on the other, covered with lettuce leaves — the outer 
ones — and then with a damp, but not wet, napkin. 
But of course, when possible, they are best made fresh. 

Curried. — Have ready some good fiaK 

cream of any kind (or pouTided «kTv^^^«fiR>w'^\^^^^\ssJixfc^ 



80 COLD FISH. 

to a paste with a little thick or whipped and seasoned 
cream) ; then turn out a tin of curried prawns and 
pound this also with cream or butter, and the hard- 
boiled yolks of two egj7H ; run a thin layer of aspic jelly 
into a shallow tin (the lid of a biscuit tin answers admir- 
ably), and, when set, spread this with the fish farce» 
and next with the curried mixture ; run more aspic over 
this, and leave it till set and firm ; then, with a sharp 
knife dipped in hot water, you cut it into squares, 
fingers, or triangles as you prefer, and dish on a bed 
of chopped aspic with little heaps of cold boiled rice, 
These are also very nice if placed, sandwich-fashion, 
between two slices of buttered Hovis bread. These 
sandwiches are also things that may be varied to taste, 
and are invariably appreciated. For instance, cold, 
cooked flaked salmon, fresh or smoked, niay be laid 
between slices of bread spread with iced cucumber 
sauce stiffened with a sheet of two of gelatine ; whilst 
cold herring, fresh or kippered; washed and boned 
sardines ; cold mackerel fillets, d:c., are all good with 
bread spread either with Gascony butter or rather 
stiff tomato mayonnaise. 

Iced Curry in Cases,— Huh a basin once or twice with 
fresh-cut garlic, then put into it half a pint of mayon* 
naise or tartare sauce, with a teaspoonful of finely- 
minced chives (or, failing this, a shallot), a dessertspoon - 
ful of good curry powder, a little dry mustard, a pinch 
of cayenne, and one pint of flaked and minced fish (of 
one kind only, or a mixture, as you please, chopped 
anchovy or shrimps being in any case an addition) ; 
toss these all lightly together, and freeze it for two or 
more hours in the charged ice cave ; then half fill some 
paper or china cases with the frozen mixture, pile up 
lightly with carefully boiled cold rice, and serve pbdn. 



SMALL ENTRlilES, &c. 81 

or decorated with chopped red and green chillies, minced 
parsley, coralline pepper, &c. Lobster, which is very 
good thus, is improved by the addition of two or three 
drops of Tabasco to the mixture. If there is not an ice 
cave, put the mixture to be frozen into a tin with a tight- 
fitting lid, luting the edge with a little fat or butter, and 
. bury it in ice and salt for two and a half to three hours. 
Filets de Sole a la diahle. — Marinade some small 
fillets of sole, then roll them, tie into shape with a 
buttered strip of paper, bake in a buttered tin with a 
little lemon juice, under a buttered paper, till cooked, 
then put them aside till cold. Prepare a Devil sauce 
thus : Crush the hard-boiled yolks of two eggs to powder, 
with a teaspoonful of mustard flour, a pinch each of 
caster sugar and cayenne, half a teaspoonful each of 
salt and freshly-ground black pepper ; mix well together, 

■ and moisten, almost drop by drop, with a full half 

■ gill of salad oil ; when this is all well blended, stir in a 
*■ very finely-minced shallot, or some minced chives, 
' adding, by degrees, rather over half a gill of claret, 

the strained juice of a lemon, an equal amount of chilli 

^ vinegar, and as many drops of Tabasco as you please. 

Put a spoonful of this sauce into as many china or paper 

cases as you have fillets, then put a fillet into each and 

^ fill up the cases with the rest of the sauce ; set a stoned 

■ olive farced with anchovy butter on each fillet, and place 
■*' the dish on ice, or in the charged ice cave, for two or 

• three hours before use. Some people use egg butter 
^ seasoned with cayenne, instead of the anchovy butter. 

• Others, again, consider the sauce too hot (it is pretty 

• strongly devilled), in which case, omit the Tabasco and 
^ the cayenne, using coralline pepper instead, and add the 
''■ juice of a second lemon instead of the chilli vinegar.

82 COLD FISH. 

small fillets of sole and of salmon, either cooked for the 
purpose (in a buttered tin under a buttered paper), or 
cut from cold, previously-cooked fish. Mask the sole 
fillets with tomato mayonnaise, and the salmon ones 
with white mayonnaise aspic, and when they are firm, 
dish them en couronne, and fill up the centre with 
8u6doise sauce iced, and garnish with scraped horse- 
radish. 

Filets de Sole, Claudine, — Fillet two nice soles, trim 
and bat out the fillets, season with wliite pepper and 
lemon juice, roll them up, and fasten into shape with a 
band of buttered paper, place them in a buttered pan 
with half a gill of fish stock, the juice of half a lemon, 
and, if liked, a few drops of wine, salt and pepper to 
taste, and bake from twelve to fifteen minutes according 
to size and thickness ; then Uft them out and leave them 
till perfectly cold. Meanwhile prepare the following 
sauce : Stir into one and a half gills of good brown sauce 
two tablespoonfuls of capers, a pinch of minced parsley, 
four washed, boned, and pounded anchovies, a tea- 
spoonful of Lemco, a minced shallot, and three or four 
minced mushrooms ; let this all boil up, and simmer it 
for ten minutes, then tammy it, add about Joz. of best 
leaf gelatine, the strained juice of a lemon, and four 
stoned and minced olives ; bring it to the boil again, 
and as soon as the gelatine is perfectly dissolved, set it aside 
till nearly cold ; then stir in lightly a spoonful or two 
of stiffly-whipped cream, and mask the fillets with this 
sauce as it is setting. When this coating is firm, trim 
the little fillets, and serve them on a bed of chopped 
aspic jelly. Another version of this dish is produced by 
masking the Uttle fillets with aspic cream, forcing a little 
rose^ of sanchovy or green butter out on each, then 
serving them surrounded with the previously-given 



SMALL ENTRliES, &c. 83 

sauce, from which, however, you should omit the 
gelatine for this purpose. 

Though soles are here given, almost any fish is good 
with this sauce, fillets of sea trout or Dutch salmon 
being particularly to be recommended. 

Darioles de Poisson a VIndienne. — Fry two small 
peeled and sliced onions in 2oz. of butter, and when 
these are tender and lightly-coloured add about half a 
teaspoonful of curry powder, and fry this also for a 
minute ; then stir in two small, sliced tomatoes, half a 
teaspoonful of curry paste, a good dessertspoonful of 
anchovy paste (the quantity of this is rather a matter of 
taste), pepper, and salt ; moisten this all with half a pint 
of good fish stock, add a full bouquet (thyme, parsley, 
lemon peel, bay leaf, onion, &c.), and simmer all for ten 
minutes. Then stir in Jib. of finely-minced cold fish, 
free from skin and bone, a dessertspoonful of chutney, 
and Joz. of leaf gelatine previoiisly dissolved in a very 
little fish stock ; when this is all well blended, sieve it, 
and when cool, stir into it about half a gill of stiffly- 
whipped cream. Have ready some dariole moulds fined 
with aspic, or savoury jelly, fill these with the fish 
mixture, setting this with a little more jelly, and put 
them aside till firm. Then turn out, and serve garnished 
with cold boiled rice, in little heaps, and chopped jelly. 

Petites Ballettes de Saumon aux Concomhres. — Into 
three-quarters of a pint of good velout6 made with fish 
stock, add a little essence of anchovy, a good dust of 
coralline pepper, loz. of best leaf gelatine, and about a gill 
or more of the court-bouillon in which the salmon was 
cooked, and boil it up sharply till the gelatine is per- 
fectly dissolved, and the sauce has reduced and thickened ; 
now add to this a gill of cream, just boil it up again, then 
put it aside to cool. Cut up lib. of cold cooka,^ 'ssbJes^x^.^

free from skin and bones, into small dice, and cut up 
about one-third the quantity of cucumber into tiny cubes 
to match, and stir these into about one-fourth part of 
the previously prepared sauce, season with white pepper, 
salt, and a little lemon juice, and stand it on ice to cool. 
Now roll this mince into balls about the size of a golf ball 
(or a little smaller), mask them with the rest of the 
sauce, to which you have added about half a gill or so 
of just liquid aspic, dust them lightly with minced 
parsley and truffles and some coralline pepper, and serve 
on a bed of chopped aspic. Any fish may be used in 
this way. 

Very pretty little dishes may be easily made of a border 
mould filled with aspic, and then turned out, and 
little balls, made as above, coloured chaufroix, or mayon- 
naise aspic, being used to coat them, as you please. For 
instance, fill a border mould with tomato aspic, and leave 
till set ; have ready some ballettes set as above in white 
sauce, or paupiettes of sole masked with aspic cream, 
and set these on the tomato mould when turned out, 
fixing the fish in place with chopped golden aspic, and 
fill up the centre with a mac^doine of cooked vegetables, 
tossed in mayonnaise, or with small cold potato balls, 
dusted with parsley and coralline pepper, and moistened 
with mayonnaise. 

Bombes de Merlan aux Huitres. — Line some bombe 
moulds with aspic cream, then fill them with a delicate 
whiting cream seasoned with coralline pepper and 
lemon, and mix with some stiffly-whipped cream ; make 
a hollow in the centre of this farce and drop in one or 
two oysters (according to the size of the mould), bearded 
and seasoned with lemon juice and coralline pepper, 
cover with more farce, set with aspic cream, and put it 
away tiU firm ; then turn out, dish in a circle, and fill 



SMALL ENTRliES, &c. 85 

up the centre of this with shred celery, crisped in cold 
water till wanted, and sliced truffles, all tossed in the 
American cooked mayonnaise. 

Filets de Sole, Ravigotte. — Bat out and trim the 
fillets from a nice sole, and cut each into two or four 
according to size ; then sprinkle one side with minced 
parsley, white pepper, salt, a drop or two of lemon 
juice, and some roughly minced shrimps (prawns or 
lobster, according to what you have), mixing these 
with a little bechamel or velout^ to spread them ; now 
roll up the fillets and fasten them into shape with a 
buttered paper, and bake for twelve to fifteen minutes 
in a well-buttered tin, seasoned with lemon juice and 
a few drops of wine or fish stock, under a buttered paper ; 
then lift them out and leave till quite cold. Now 
remove the paper bands, trim the fillets neatly into shape 
and mask them with ravigotte aspic (three large table- 
spoonfuls of ravigotte sauce blended with a short half 
pint of just liquid aspic), garnishing them when this 
is set with a rosette of anchovy butter, and serve 
with triangles of aspic jelly, and seasoned watercress. 
Any small fillets of fish may be treated thus, and 
need not be rolled. 

Petites Timbales de Crabe en Mayonnaise. — Pick 
the flesh from a good crab and pound it with a mustard- 
spoonful each of made English and French mustard, coral- 
line pepper, salt, a dessertspoonful of essence of anchovy, 
a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and, if liked, a 
drop or two of Tabasco. When this is all smooth, 
blend with it half a gill of thick cream, and two and a 
half gills of aspic, and sieve it. Now line some bombe 
or timbale moulds with tomato jelly, fill them up with 
the crab pur6e, cover with more jelly, and put thswi. 
away to set. Turn out, diab. m & ctt^^'fc^ «cA ^^nxs^ "^^c^fc

centre with broken-up lettuce, tossed in mayonnaise, 
garnished with anchovy fillets, and halved or quartered 
plover's eggs. 

Tomates en Surprise, — Stir together a gill of tomato 
conserve (or the sieved pulp of some fresh cooked toma- 
toes), with a pint of just liquid aspic jelly, adding a few 
drops of carmine, if necessary, to bring up the colour 
(be careful and economical with this), then line some 
tomato moulds with this aspic and, when set, fill them 
with cold flaked fish of any kind, tossed in r^moulade 
or tartare sauce, pouring a little aspic over to set them, 
press the two halves of the moulds together, and leave 
till firm. Serve on a bed of chopped aspic, garnished 
with seasoned watercress. Any cold fish may be used 
for this dish, which does not necessarily require the 
tomato moulds, though they are an improvement. 

Canots d VIndienne, — For these take little boat- 
shaped moulds (though small patty pans may be used 
if handier). Line the tins with anchovy paste, prick 
them all over, and bake till crisp and dry in a moderate 
oven. They will take from twelve to fifteen minutes. 
Fill these, when cold, with any kind of flaked fish tossed 
in curry sauce, piling them up well ; then mask them 
evenly with more curry sauce, stiffened in the proportion 
of four parts jelly to one of sauce, and when set garnish 
with strips of red chilli and a tiny tuft of chervil. 

Any fish may be served in this way, which is, however, 
particularly good for the remains of any rather coarse 
and tasteless fish, especially if originally stewed, or 
served en casserole. 

It 13 manifest that in a book of this size it is impossible 
to reproduce even a tithe of the pretty ways in which 
clever cooks use up their scraps of cold fish and odds 
and ends of sauces, for it cani\ot. be too attou^ly or too 



SMALL ENTRIES, &c. 87 

frequently impressed on the average culinary artist (?) 
that a clever cook is invariably an economical one, 
and never wastes anything, however small ; though he 
or she may be an expensive one, from the variety of 
materials needed. 

If British housekeepers, and their attendants, could 
be induced to understand the importance of small things 
we could have far more variety and daintiness in our 
menus, and much less expense in our housekeeping ; 
but it is safe to say this millenium will never come 
till the mistresses themselves will take an intelligent 
and practical interest in the service of their tables. 
It is to the interest a French house-mistress takes 
in her housekeeping and kitchen, that the much 
quoted superiority of the bonne-d-tout-faire over the 
British *' general " is due. Ang6lique is perfectly 
aware that Madame expects, and is determined to have, 
full value for her culinary expenditure, not only in 
actual food, but in dainty and careful service, and is 
thoroughly capable, if need be, of giving practical 
demonstration of what she wants done, and moreover 
stands in no awe of Ang61ique. Mary- Jane, on the 
contrary, has not a little secret, and perhaps open, 
contempt for the " missus," the depths of whose ignor- 
ance she has long since fathomed, and is perfectly aware 
that the said mistress is haunted by a dread of worse 
befalling her, should she in any way ruffle the feelings 
of her cordon bleu, and lead to the much-dreaded phrase : 
" This day month, ma'am ! '* 



CHAPTEE VI. 

SAUCES, GAENISHES, &c. 

Cold fish, like all cold dishes indeed, requires dainty 
handling and decoration, and it cannot be too strongly 
impressed on the operator that the slightest appearance 
of heaviness, over-handling, or messiness, will spoil 
any dish, however choice its ingredients, or however 
well cooked they may be. Occasionally a little artificial 
colouring is almost indispensable to bring up the colour, 
but this cannot be too carefully, evenly grudgingly, 
added, for if at all overdone it at once vulgarises the 
plat completely. Never add any uneatable garnish 
to a dish if you can avoid it. Socles of fat or wax wonder- 
fully carved, statuettes of wax, &c., may be needed for 
State banquets, or for large ballroom supper buffets, 
but for ordinary purposes a mould or socle of aspic, 
or jelly of any kind, or a crouton of bread, fried to 
a golden brown, and served plain or masked with any 
coloured butter to taste, is all that is necessary, and 
for such purposes is, moreover, in far better taste. 
Fish to be masked must be absolutely stiff-cold, before 
you attempt to mask it with any sauce ; it must be 
neatly trimmed, the sauce (in the case of a large piece 
or whole fish) being gently poured over it, just as the 
liquid is on the point of setting. Where small pieces 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c. 89 

or fillets are concerned, lift them on a broad-bladed 
or palette knife with your left hand, and ladle the 
just-stiffening sauce over them, with a spoon held in 
the right hand. Do this carefully so as to get the 
masking even and all over the article, then put it aside 
till the sauce is set, when if not sufficiently brilliant, 
a thin coating of plain aspic or savoury jelly may be 
poured over it all, and when this is firm it is ready 
for use. If savoury butter is used, as in Saumon Mont- 
pelier, &c., spread this evenly over the fish, smoothing 
it with a hot, damp knife, and finishing with jelly as 
before. 

One of the prettiest decorations for cold dishes is 
chopped aspic, and, as will be seen later, it is not a very 
expensive or troublesome luxury. But please remember 
the finer it is chopped the prettier and brighter will 
it be. The knife used should be dipped in cold water, 
and the jelly should be chopped on a well-moistened 
sheet of paper ; where you wish to use triangles, &c., 
of this jelly (aspic croutons as they are technically called), 
run the just liquid jelly on to a perfectly clean dish or 
tin, to the thickness you wish your crouton to be, 
leave this till set, then stamp or cut it out to the size 
and shape you please. Again, if you wish to jelly 
fish fillets, &c., plainly, run a layer of aspic on 
a dish or tin (the lid of a biscuit tin answers well 
for this), and when this is all but set and is only 
just " tacky," as cooks say, ky the fillets on it, 
allowing a good margin between each, and then pour 
more jelly over it all till the fillets are perfectly covered. 
When this second layer is quite set, with a sharp knife or 
a cutter, cut out each piece, allowing an edge of aspic 
all round. These can then be dished as you please^ 
the extra aspic jelly being chopped. \xp lox ^ \g6,w>^. 



90 COLD FISH. 

N.B. — This is an excellent method of preparing fillets 
(or, indeed, cutlets, &c.) for a picnic. Choose say a 2lb. 
biscuit tin with a well-fitting lid, pour in a layer of 
aspic one-eighth of an inch thick, then lay in some fillets 
as advised above, cover these with more jelly, then more 
fish, and so on, repeating the layers till the box is fnJl, 
being careful to finish with jelly. Now let this set, cover 
with a moistened sheet of paper, fix on the lid tightly, 
and the tin will travel safely anywhere (even by post D 
and can be turned out when wanted, cut up, and gar- 
nished as before. Eolled fillets, or paupiettes, may also 
be packed in the same way for such a purpose. For 
instance, collect small round cocoa or other tins, 
choosing the slender ones by preference, then pour in 
some of the aspic, slip in a paupiette, and pour over it 
sufficient jelly to cover it about half an inch thick ; on 
this when firm lay another paupiette, and more jelly. 
These tins usually only hold two sets of fish. When 
wanted, turn out and cut the little aspic roll in two, half- 
way between the two rolls of fish, and serve garnished 
with fresh watercress. The advantage of these make- 
shift moulds is that you need not trouble about them» 
and if one or two go astray it does not matter as it 
would were the fish moulded in your best Uttle copper 
darioles or bombes. At the same time, though your 
cook will utilise these makeshifts complacently on such 
a *' scratch " occasion (for she will be gkwi to save her 
cherished " moulds "), you have no right to expect her 
to be content with such oddments for ordinary daily use. 
If your style of living authorises such little dainties 3rou 
must be prepared to supply the necessary adjuncts. 
Now this is a point on which many mistresses wreck 
their domestic peace. They simply cannot be made to see 
the value of labour-savers. If such Ihitiea «*re suggested 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c. 91 

they look horrified : '* My dear, what nonsense ! A 
bain-marie in our kitchen ? All those moulds, stoners, 
corers, <fec., in our house *? Certainly not, the woman 
would not know what to do with them ! They are for 
chefs and hotel kitchens I" It never seems to strike 
them that if needed in a kitchen where there is a large 
culinary staff, they are doubly necessary where there is 
but one pair of hands, however willing, to do the worTi. 
Now this is a mistake seldom if ever made by foreign 
housewives. When their bonne suggests that 
** madame has ordered darioles (or whatever it may be), 
but has neglected to provide the necessary jnoulds, 
which she has doubtless forgotteni? " Madame shrugs 
her shoulders, and, muttering to herself : " Qui vent la 
fin, vent les moyens,'' goes off at once to order the articles 
desired. The next item for which directions are given, 
is the savoury butter. This is a very important item 
in foreign cookery, as it is there held that a dash of one 
or other of these beurres composes, added just at the last 
to any sauce, imparts the crowning delicacy to the 
condiment. Abroad a morsel of fresh butter is all but 
invariably added to every sauce just as the pan is lifted 
off, the butter being dissolved by the heat of the liquid 
without actually cooking, thus giving just the fresh 
buttery taste which differentiates the French sauce 
from its English synonym. If to this fresh butter a 
further aroma be added, it follows paturally that the ^ 
savour is still further increased, whilst the velvety ^ 
texture is improved as well. For cold dishes these 
butters are fully as important, not only as garnishes uy^.^ 
the shape of little balls, &a, but for use as a coating for. 
cold fish, which may be varied wonderfully by the use 
of these flavoured butters.

form is the following : Put in a delicately-clean pan 2oz. 
of best leaf gelatine (we always use Mrs. A. B. Marshall's 
(30, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, as not only 
does it not vary in quality, but it needs no previons 
soaking), a quart of hot water, a dessertspoonful of 
salt, the juice of one lemon, a bay leaf, two or three sprays 
of green tarragon (or a tablespoonful of tarragon 
vinegar), a sliced onion, twenty peppercorns, a short gill 
of good vinegar (white wine vinegar if the aspic is to be 
pale, good brown malt vinegar if ^Ab to be dark), and 
the whites and shells of two eggs. \^^ these ingredients 
thoroufihly, bring them to the boil, thnk run them all 
through the jelly bag. If properly maVv this produces 
a beautifully clear jelly. 

Jelly with Stock. — Put into a pan 2oz. of 

Mrs. A. B. Marshall's leaf gelatine, a quart of hot, very 
clear consomm^ (meat or fish), a bay leaf, a dessert- 
spoonful of salt, the juice of a lemon, a short gill of 
brown malt vinegar, a spray or two of tarragon (or a 
tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar), a sliced onion, and 
twenty peppercorns and allspice mixed. Bring all this 
to the boil, and then run it through the jelly bafl£| If this 
jelly is to bCused for border^, or for the lining on? mould, 
2joz. of gelatine should be' jised. 

A very nice savoury jelly may also be made in this way : 
Dissolve 2oz. of the leaf gelatine in one pint and a half 
K of good fish stock (or the strained and skimmed court- 
^ bouillon in which fish has been cooked), with a dessert- 
spoonful of salt, the finely-cut zest of two lemons (peeled 
^^fchin enough te avoid any white pith), and the just 
\»othed whites of two eggs y^iih their crushed shells, 
stirring it- all over a sharp fire continuously till it just 
begins to boil, then draw it to the side, and only let it 
simmer for ten minutes. Now strain it very carefully

taste with salt and white pepper, and bring it gently 
to the lx)il ; simmer till the gelatine isYabsolutely dis- 
solved, then add a drop or two of Tabasco, a squeeze of 
lemon juice or a few drops of white tarragon vinegar, 
and mould as required in a well-rinsed mould. Some 
cooks boil a strip of lemon peel, or a blade of mace, <fec., 
with the milk and gelatine, removing this before mould- 
ing, and add a good dust of coralline pepper. 

Butter, Anchovy. — Well wash 8oz. of anchovies pre- 
served in brine, bone and pound them, very smooth, 
with an ounce of butter, sieving it afterwards if you are 
not certain of having removed all bones, and lastly miy 
the whole with 3oz. or 4oz. of fresh butter. Anchovies 
preserved in oil are also nice, where the fish preserved 
in brine are considered too salt ; whilst many cooks use 
anchovy paste or essence of anchovy with the butter 
to save themselves, but neither of these answer really so 
well as the fish. If the essence is used the yolk of a hard- 
boiled egg should be worked up with the butter, &c., 
to give it substance, whilst a drop or two of carmine may 
be needed to bring up the colour. 

Coralline. — Put into a basin a teaspoonfulof 

cayenne, coralline, or Nepal pepper, and work it to a 
smooth paste with about 4oz. of fresh butter, being 
careful to mix it well as this butter is not sieved. Coral- 
line pepper is the best, as its tint is so bright, whilst 
its flavour is not so pronounced as that of the others. 
Searcy or celery salt are nice used thus. 

Curry. — Fry a spoonful of good curry 

powder for a minute or two in an ounce of butter, leave 
it till cold, then work it into 3oz. or 4oz. of fresh butter, 
adding, if Hked, a dust of coralline pepper and a drop 
or two of lemon juice. Unless you cook the curry 
jt is apt to have a harsh, acrid taste like snuflF. 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c. 95 

Gascony. — Pick over a good bunch of water- 
cress, wash, dry, and mince it well ; rub a mortar or 
basin two or three times with a clove of fresh-cut garlic, 
and pound the watercress in this, working in as much 
fresh butter as it will take up, and seasoning it to taste 
with salt and white pepper. This is one of many forms 
of Gascony butter, most of which, however, are too 
strongly flavoured to be acceptable in this coimtry. 
Indeed, in this form you may omit the garlic altogether, 
simply using watercress and seasoning with the butter, 
but it must then be known as Watercress butter. 

Horseradisk. — Grate very finely one large 

or two small, well-washed and scraped horseradish, 
and pound this to a smooth paste with fresh butter, 
seasoning it to taste with chilli vinegar ; if preferred, 
butter whipped to a cream, or stiffly whipped cream may 
be used instead of plain butter, but any way this butter 
needs to be well iced. 

Lobster. — Pound the shells and claws of a 

fine lobster to a smooth paste with as much fresh butter 
as it will take up ; then place this in a small pan or jar 
in the bain-marie (or in a stewpan three parts full of 
boiling water) and cook till the butter is all melted 
and nicely coloured. Now wring it through coarse 
muslin, and leave till set, when you scrape oflF any 
discoloured parts, wipe it well, and re-melt it, adding 
a little coralline pepper, stirring this all well together 
till it sets. This second melting improves both the 
texture and the colour. Crayfish and shrimp butter 
may be made in the same way ; but for shrimp butter 
most cooks prefer to use the shrimps whole, shells 
and all, pounding them with fresh butter, coralline 
pepper, and a dust of mace. Prawn butter is oiade 
in the same way, but a specially good wLTicxrcvXe. '^s. 



96 COLD FISH. 

produced by using loz. of curry butter with the fresh 
butter. 

Maitre d'Hotel. — Blanch some nice fresh 

parsley and press it (without squeezing it) till dry, 
then mince it finely, and pound this mince into as much 
fresh butter as it will take up, seasoning it with white 
pepper, salt, and lemon juice to taste. Be sure not 
to over-work this butter, or it will spoil. Shape into 
pats or balls as you please, and keep it on ice. 

Montpelier. — This is made in two ways. 

The first is simply maitre d'hotel butter, to which you 
add one or more washed and boned anchovies, in the 
pounding, working this all to a smooth paste ; the second 
is obtained by pounding together loz. of ravigotte 
butter and one washed and boned anchovy with as much 
butter as it will take up. 

Mustard. — Work together mustard flour 

with as much butter as it will take up, seasoning it with 
chilli vinegar and a httle coralline pepper. 

Perigueux. — Peel, trim, and mince five or 

six truffles and cook them for five minutes or so in a few 
spoonfuls of Madeira or sherry, then when cool, pound 
them in a mortar to a smooth paste with 4oz. of fresh 
butter ; half a well washed and boned anchovy, or a few 
drops of essence of anchovy may be added if the dish 
it is to go with requires it. 

Ravigotte. — Blanch and pound together a 

good spray each of parsley, chervil, and tarragon, some 
chives, a tiny shallot, and some small cress, and pimper- 
nel if at hand ; work this up with loz. of butter, white 
pepper, and a very little salt, and, if liked, half a tea- 
spoonful of essence of anchovy, rubbing it all, if 
necessary, through a sieve and adding a drop or 
two of green colouring. If the anchovy is replaced 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c. 97 

by a chopped and pounded gherkin or two, this 
becomes B., Printanier, 

D'Uxelles Mixture. — This consists of equal quantities 
of minced parsley and mushrooms, with half a part 
of chives or finely-minced shallot, tossed in butter 
for a few minutes, and then left till cold. Take, say 
4oz. each of parsley and mushrooms, Ijoz. of chives or 
shallot, and 2oz. of butter, and stir it all over the fire, 
seasoning it to taste with pepper and salt, stirring it all 
well together. This may be used for stuffing for fish, 
and is usually a great improvement on the minced and 
uncooked parsley, &c., so often recommended. 

Egg Garnish. — The best form of this is obtained by 
breaking the eggs and separating the yolks and whites, 
cooking each in a diflFerent tin. Lightly mix together 
the yolks without actually beating them, then turn them 
into any convenient little mould, fold a sheet of paper, 
put it into a baking tin with a little hot water in it, set 
the mould in this and bake it gently in the oven till the 
egg is set, adding more water if necessary, at the same 
temperature. The whites can be baked or poached in 
the same way, but always cook it very gently, or it will 
not set fiat, and will not then cut evenly for garnish. 

Sauces. — See. Argenteuil. — Pound the yolks of three 
hard-boiled eggs to a paste with half a gill of salad oil, 
a teaspoonful of mustard, a saltspoonful of pepper (red, 
black, or white, according to taste), and one of salt ; 
mix this all thoroughly, then work in a tablespoonful 
of cold veloute sauce, and, lastly, a teaspoonful of 
tarragon vinegar and a spoonful of chopped green 
tarragon, or, failing this, a spoonful of chopped green 
parsley, and serve very cold. Excellent with most cold 
fish, but particularly good with cold broiled herring. 

See. Bearnaise. — This is really, v;Y\^tv oc^j^^ ^ Vstxss. 'sK 



98 COLD FISH. 

Dutch sauce, and is prepared thus : Put into a pan a gill 
each of Chablis and best vinegar (the white tarragon 
vinegar is nicest), with a teaspoonful of very finely- 
minced shallot and a pinch of salt, and boil it fast till 
reduced by half. Now strain it off, and leave till cold. 
Next make a good custard with the yolks of four eggs 
and half a pint of milk, season to taste with salt, and 
white and coralline pepper, then leave it on ice till cold. 
When both custard and wine, &c., are cold, whip the 
latter very, very gradually into the custard, and 
garnish with about a teaspoonful of minced green 
tarragon. 

If to the above quantities you add two or three table- 
spoonfuls of good tomato pur^, this makes a delicious 
sauce for serving with any cold fish under the name of 
See. a la Francaise. While, if you add a couple of 
tablespoonfuls of pounded shrimps and a spoonful 
more, coarsely minced, you produce See, Cherbourg — 
sometimes called See. Normande. In fact, this sauce 
may be varied almost indefinitely. If you have not the 
Chablis, use a gill each of white tarragon vinegar and the 
best plain vinegar. 

See. Casanova. — Rub a bowl across once or twice with 
fresh cut garlic, then in it crush together the hard- 
boiled yolk of an egg, a pinch of salt, and of white pepper, 
a mustardspoonf ul each of French and English mustard, 
and a dust of coralline pepper ; now stir into this the 
yolk of a raw egg (this should be fresh, but not new-laid, 
for these never make such good sauce as eggs that are 
twenty-four hours old) ; stir this all together well, then 
add, almost drop by drop, a teaspoonful of good thick 
cream, and work it all together, adding gradually more 
cream till the sauce* is about as thick as butter. (Be 
careful in adding this, as if you put in too much, the 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c, 99 

sauce will thin suddenly, and will give a good deal of 
trouble to get thick again.) Now work into it, 
also very gradually, about one and a half tea- 
spoonfuls of strained lemon juice ; and when ready this 
sauce should become quite white and thick. Kub 
the sauceboat in which it is to be served with the garlic, 
stir into the sauce the hard-boiled white of the egg and 
two or three truffles, all cut into julienne strips, then 
pour it into the boat and stand it on ice till wanted. 

See. Chaufroix (Brown). — Put into a pan together a 
full gill of good brown sauce, two good tablespoonfuls 
of sherry, Joz. of Lemco, half a pint of savoury jelly, 
and a good dust of coralline pepper ; boil it up sharply 
till reduced a fourth part, keeping it well skimmed whilst 
boiling, then tammy it, and use as it is setting. This 
sauce admits of considerable variation, according to the 
kind of sauce and wine used ; for instance, plain brown 
sauce requires sherry ; espagnole takes Madeira, cham- 
pagne, or Burgundy ; or Chablis will go with either, 
according to the style of fish and garnish it is to go 
with ; truffles, for instance, used in perigenx sauce 
require Burgundy, either white or red, and so on. A 
little attention to these details makes a great difference 
in the delicacy of the dish. It is well also to remember 
that chaufroix sauce is not necessarily a form of aspic ; 
cooks are too apt to forget that the foundation flavour of 
aspic is always an acid that may not be, and, to speak 
the truth, very often is not, suitable for chaufroix 
sauces, which should be, and originally were, made 
without any stiffening substance whatever ; the con- 
sistency and flavour being obtained by the careful 
reduction of the sauce in question. Later on, when 
chefs learnt to be sparing, both in time and material, 
they stiffened their sauces, first with v«»v\%\3^^^^\v\*0«!«^

with gelatine, to avoid 'the expenditure of ingredients 
and labour necessitated by the ancient reduction 
process ; but they kept the line between chaufroix and 
aspic sauces very sharply defined. 

(White). — For this reduce together a fourth 

part a gill of bechamel with a gill of thick creai;a and 
half a pint of savoury jelly, keeping it well skimmed ; 
sieve it, and use when setting. 

(Pink,' also called a VAurore), — Put a gill of 

cardinal sauce into a pan with a gill of thick cream and 
half a pint of jelly, reduce, skim, and sieve as before ; 
then add to it enough lobster coral butter (or coralline 
pepper butter) to bring it to a delicate pink, and use 
whilst cooling. This is a very favourite sauce. For the 
Cardinal see, you stir into half a pint of velout6 maigre 
a few drops of lemon juice, a dash of cayenne, a little fish 
glaze, or Lemco, and essence of anchovy to taste ; let 
this boil up, and then use as above. 

Sce.^ Chervil Cream, — Eeduce a fourth part, as before, 
a gill each of thick cream, rich bechamel, and half a pint 
of jelly, then sieve, and for half a pint of this sauce stir in a 
good dust of salt, two teaspoonf uls finely-minced chervil, 
a few drops of chilli vinegar, and the same of lemon juice ; 
mix this all well together, and use when cooling. This 
sauce may be varied almost indefinitely ; for instance, 
use green tarragon and tarragon vinegar instead of the 
chervil, and you have Crime Froide a VEstragon, Or 
minced parsley and plain vinegar may be used for Crime 
au persil, but in this case the sauce is improved by being 
brought to a pale green with a drop or two of parsley 
or other vegetable-green colouring ; or, again, very finely- 
grated horseradish and horseradisli vinegar may be 
used ; this is particularly good with cold sturgeon, and 
is often known as Crime Raifort. 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, &c. 101 

See., Cucuinber Cream. — Cook a small cucumber till 
tender in milk, weak stock, or water, then sieve it, and 
when cold mix the pur6e with a gill of mayonnaise, 
half a gill of stiffly-whipped cream, a tablespoonful of 
tarragon vinegar, a pinch of salt, and a very small dust 
of caster sugar ; colour this with a few drops of vegetable 
green, keeping the tint very pale, and just at the last 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of just liquid aspic jelly. For 
this sauce aspic should be used, as it suits the mayon- 
naise. 

See., Curried (Iced). — Of this there are two kinds ; 
for the first, reduce sharply nearly to half, half a pint 
each of thick, well-flavoured curry sauce and jelly 
(either savoury, or aspic, as you please) ; then, when 
cooling, stir into it a gill of stiffly-whipped cream, and 
use when just setting ; or else place it in the ice cave, 
or on ice till almost frozen. This is particularly good 
with crab, lobster, or cold salmon. For the second 
method, stir together equal parts of mayonnaise and 
whipped cream, stirring in sufficient good curry- 
powder to flavour it appreciably, add a good dust of 
cayenne or coralhne pepper, and serve. 

See., Dutch (Cold). — Dutch, or Hollandaise, sauce is, in 
its original state, essentially a hot sauce, the mixture 
of flavoured butter and eggs of which it is composed 
being far too rich to eat cold ; still, where a sauce of this 
kind is desired, a very palatable cold version may be made 
by using a custard of eggs and milk, seasoned to taste 
as the foundation. For instance, put half a pint of 
good vinegar in a pan with a teaspoonful of minced 
shallot or onion, some roughly-bruised allspice or black 
peppercorns, and a bay leaf, with a little salt, and boil 
this sharply till reduced to a gill, strain it,* and let it get 
cold. Now make a custard aa Cot \,\\fc V^fe^rwsissfc ^e^^^^ 



102 COLD FISH. 

above, and work into this very gradually the reduced 
vinegar, till it is smooth and perfectly blended, add a 
little minced tarragon, and use cold. This is also very 
good if white vin ordinaire is used instead of the vinegar. 

See., Horseradish (Crkme Raifort),—We]\ wash, scrape, 
and grate very finely a stick of young hoi^radish, 
and to two good tablespoonfuls of this add half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and about half a gill of single cream or 
new milk, simmer this gently together for a minute or 
two to extract the flavour of the horseradish, but mind 
it does not boil hard ; then stir in quickly, off the fire, 
one and a half tablespoonfuls of vinegar (either plain or 
seasoned) and a tiny dust of caster sugar ; let this cool, 
then stand it on ice till wanted. Another way is to 
clean and grate the horseradish as above, then whisk it 
quickly into a gill of stiffly-whipped cream, flavouring 
it as you do so with cayenne and lemon juice, or chilli 
vinegar. Abroad, thick sour cream is mostly used for 
this sauce. 

See., Lobster. — Pick the meat from a lobster and cut 
it into neat dice, break up the shell and boil it in milk, 
or fish stock, or water, as you please, till the liquid is 
thoroughly flavoured ; then melt Joz. of fresh butter, 
and sprinkle in from Joz. to loz. of fine, sifted flour 
{according to the richness you wish your sauce to be), 
and stir this over the fire till the butter has thoroughly 
absorbed the flour, and the two form a smooth, even 
paste ; then add gradually half a pint of the liquor in 
which you boiled the lobster shell, stirring it steadily all 
the time to prevent any lumps forming ; when the 
liquid is well amalgamated, boil it together for ten 
minutes or so, then add a dash of lemon juice, coralline 
pepper, the minced lobster, and at the very last, a 
spoonful of cream, or a tiny pat of butter, but do not 



SAUCES, GARNISHES, «fec. 103 

leave the pan on the fire after adding the butter. A 
few drops of essence of anchovy are an addition to this 
sauce, but must be added very carefully, as the anchovy 
must not betray its presence, but is only used to bring 
out the flavour of the lobster. Shrimp see, is made in 
precisely the same way ; boiling the shells to flavour the 
stock, and adding at the last a drop or two of carmine 
to colour it a pale pink. Orah see, may be made in the 
same way, though you need not boil the shell, but for 
this sauce it is always better to use a very rich bechamel 
nade with fish stock. 

See, Mayonnaise, — Rub together a teaspoonful of 
mustard flour, about half an average saltspoonful of 
salt, and the same of white pepper, work into this the 
raw yolk of an egg ; mix in with a wooden spoon, almost 
drop by drop, some good salad oil, till it is as thick as 
butter, then stir in about a teaspoonful or so of vinegar, 
plain, or flavoured, as you please, when it will become 
quite creamy, and is ready for use. This will take very 
nearly half a pint of salad oil. Of course the amount of 
vinegar is a matter of taste, but must not be overdone. 
The great secret in making mayonnaise is to add the oil 
as slowly as possible at first ; if added too quickly it 
may thin suddenly, or it may curdle, and then the only 
thing is to break another egg yolk into a fresh, clean 
basin, and work the curdled sauce into it almost drop 
by drop. If this sauce must be kept, add a tablespoonf ul 
of boiling water to it very carefully at the last, and cork 
it down closely in a wide-mouthed bottle, so that the air 
does not get to it till required for use ; for if it does the 
sauce will inevitably become rank and strong. 

In America a eooked mayonnaise is used, which is said 
to keep for a few days without deteriorating. For 
this beat well together the yoVka ol ^n^ ^%"^'\sn. "^'^s^'^^ 



104 COLD FISH. 

then add a coffeecupful of vinegar, from l^oz. to 2oz. 
of butter, a tablespoonful of made mustard, a dessert^ 
spoonful of salt, and a little white pepper ; stand the 
jug in a pan of boiling water over the fire, and keep 
it stirred till it thickens like a custard. Now let it 
cool, then stir in the stiffly-whipped whites of the eggs, 
and use with any cold fish. If you blanch (i.e., pit 
on in cold water, bring to the boil, strain off, and rime 
in cold water), say, a small handful each of chervil, 
chives, parsley, spinach, tarragon, watercress (and 
bur net if available), according to what you have, then 
dry and mince them very fine, and pound them with a 
little butter to a smooth paste, then mix this with 
half a pint of rich mayonnaise sauce, adding a drop 
of vegetable green colouring, it becomes Mayonnaise 
verte, See, Vert-pre, or one form of See. Ravigotte. (The 
other form of this is made by blanching, drying, and 
mincing the herbs as before, and stirring them till 
fairly thick into a French salad dressing.) If you 
add these minced herbs to a white mayonnaise, stirring 
in at the last hard-boiled egg yolk and white, and 
truffles, &c., cut into julienne strips, with some small 
dice of lobster or prawns, it becomes See. a la Prince 
de GalleSy a favourite adjunct to filets de sole en aspie. 

Of red mayonnaise there are two forms, one made 
by incorporating a little coralline pepper and some 
mustard (to taste) with half a pint of good mayonnaise, 
working in as much pounded and sieved lobster coral 
as will bring it all to a rich red colour. (This should 
be made in the boat it is to be served in, and should 
be kept on ice.) The other form, also called tomato 
mayonnaise, is made by blending either a gill of French 
conserve de tomates, or a pur6e made by sieving four

vinegar (or a teaspoonful of anchovy and three of plain 
vinegar), and rather better than a gill of rich mayon- 
naise. If instead of oil, vinegar, and egg yolks you 
use lemon juice, cream, and egg whites, you will get 
a very dainty white mayonnaise^ most useful for serving 
with delicate fish of any kind. Either this form, or 
ordinary mayonnaise, is also excellent if just before 
serving you stir into it a good tablespoonful of drained 
and minced olives, a few drops of lemon juice, and a 
dust of coralline pepper, when it is known as M. aux 
Olives. If ordinary mayonnaise is used, half a gill of 
stiffly-whipped cream or a stiffly whisked egg-white 
should be stirred in just at the last, and a better sauce 
for cold fillets of sole is hard to find. If any of these 
mayonnaises is required for masking fish, &c., mix 
three full tablespoonfuls of the mayonnaise chosen 
with a short half pint of just liquid aspic, and use 
when setting. This is then known as red, white, or green 
mayonnaise aspic, according to the mayonnaise chosen. 
If, again, you add about an extra teaspoonful of mustard 
flour to the raw yolk of egg when starting the mixing, 
using shallot or anchovy vinegar, instead of plain 
or otherwise seasoned vinegar, herbs as for mayonnaise 
verte, but minced, not pounded, finishing with a dessert- 
spoonful of sliced gherkin or minced capers, or half 
of each, you get a tartare sauce. If, again, you mix 
the mayonnaise in the first instance with a tablespoonful 
of French mustard, preferably moutarde de Maille^ 
then add the pounded herbs, with either four washed 
boned, and minced anchovies or a proportionate amount 
of anchovy paste, you obtain mayonnaise a la remoulade^ 
or more shortly, See, Remoulade, 

A mayonnaise collee or gelatine-stiffened mayonnaise 
is often used by foreign cooks that d\ff«^^\w^jwsiR.^^^^

from the ordinary mayonnaise aspic given above. 
For this put into a basin half a pint of liquid aspic, 
and as it is beginning to set whisk in, a very little at 
a time, about a gill of best salad oil. As this thickens, 
which it soon does, beat in more oil till you get the 
quantity and texture required, then add a little vinegar 
plain or seasoned (being careful not to get it too tart), 
a good sprinkling of finely-minced fines herbeSy or 
parsley, chervil, chives, and green tarragon, and at 
the last stir in about a tablespoonful of cream. This 
is not a necessity, but is a great addition. 

See., Oyster,— Beard as many oysters as you need 
and save their liquor, add to this as much water as will 
make up a generous] half pint, and boil the beards 
in it till the liquor is well flavoured. Now take Ijoz* 
of white roux (or loz. butter and Joz. of flour stirred 
together over the fire till blended to a smooth paste) 
and moisten it with the oyster liquor, boiling it all 
together for a few minutes till perfectly amalgamated, 
and when ready lay in the oysters, whole or halved, 
and let them heat gently till quite hot, but without 
boiling ; Joz.of butter, or one or two spoonfuls of cream 
stirred in at the last with a few drops of lemon juice, 
and a seasoning of white pepper and salt finish it. 

See, Ste, Mhiehoulde. — Rub a basin three or four 
times with fresh-cut garlic, and pound together 
in it the hard-boiled yolks of three eggs, half a gill 
of made mustard, salt, pepper, two shallots, a small 
onion blanched and minced, and a little parsley. When 
this is all smooth, add in, almost drop by drop, six table- 
spoonfuls of oil, and then as it thickens work in two 
tablespoonfuls of best vinegar, and stand on ice. 

See,y Sardine. — Boil sharply a short half pint of fish 
stock with a strip of lemon peel, a bay leaf, some 



SAUCES. GARNISHES, &c. 107 

parsley, and six or eight white peppercorns ; when 
reduced to half, strain and stir into it a gill of just liquid 
aspic jelly, six honed, wiped, and smoothly pounded 
sardines, adding lastly, when it is cold and all hut 
setting, a gill of stiffly-whipped cream. Set on ice 
till wanted. 

See, Suedoise, — Stir together two tahlespoonfuls 
each of finely-grated horseradish and thick cream, 
add these to half a pint of rather thick mayonnaise, 
with a dash of cayenne, and set on ice till wanted, or 
freeze it m a Neapolitan ice-mould in the charged ice 
cave, and serve cut into fingers. 

See., Tomato Cream. — Crush and sieve four large 
ripe tomatoes, adding salt, pepper, and, if necessary, 
a drop or two of carmine ; then mix it with half a gill 
of just liquid aspic, also a dessertspoonful of tarragon 
vinegar, a teaspoonful of chilli vinegar, a little finely- 
minced tarragon and chervil, and lastly a short gill 
of stiffly-whipped cream. Failing fresh tomatoes use 
a gill of the French conserve de tomateSj but in that 
case be careful with the vinegar. 

(Iced). — Cook together four tahlespoonfuls 

of conserve de tomxites, four sliced tomatoes, a dessert- 
spoonful of good vinegar, an ounce of butter, and a 
little cayenne till soft enough to pulp through a sieve, 
and stand this on ice or in the ice cave till wanted. 

. Halve 3lb. of good, ripe, and red tomatoes, 

and place them in a large pan with a good bouquet, two 
pinches of salt, one of pepper, and a full gill of water ; 
cook this all gently together for forty minutes, stirring 
it every five or six minutes with a very clean wooden 
spoon, to prevent its catching, then sieve it, add to it 
one-third of a pint of good brown sauce, and cook this 
together for twenty minutes loug^w^ atvctvA.% >^ "^^ss^ 



108 COLD FISH. 

and again during the process. This can also be made 
with canned tomatoes, simply sieving these into rather 
more than a gill of the brown sauce. Do not get this 
sauce too thick. 

Sce.y Vinaigrette. — Dissolve a small teaspoonful of 
fine salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of freshly-ground 
black pepper in two tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, 
then work into it six or seven tablespoonfuls of best 
salad oil, tossing the salad into this, and, when it is 
all well mixed, adding a spoonful or two of minced 
herbs, such as chervil, chives, parsley, green tarragon, 
&c., known in France as the foumiture. Putting 
the salt and pepper into the vinegar dissolves it, and 
avoids any chance of the gritty taste many people 
dislike so much. Many salad-makers mix the vinegar, 
&c., first with the salad, and then add the oil, tossing 
it all together again for the second time. In this country 
few people remember that, in old-fashioned France, 
mixing this dish was known as fatiguer la salade^ as 
they held that it could hardly be too much mixed. 

Sce.y Watercress. — ^Well wash and pound half a 
market bunch of watercress with a dessertspoonful 
of capers, loz. of butter, and the yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs, sieve this, and stir it into one-third of a 
pint of rich mayonnaise and half a gill of stiffly-whipped 
cream.

Opinioni of the Preis of Prevloiui Bditioiui. 

" For yachtsmen, who, as a rule, have had no early training on board ship, 
books are yet more valuable ... if they are written by men who are well 
acquainted with the subject, and have the power of expressing themselves clearly. 
There can be no doubt that the author of the present work possesses both these 
qualifications in a high degree. . . . We would specially refer to the chaptera 
on the selection and examination of a yacht as specimens of clear and valuable 
instruction. . . . The work amply fulfils the promise of its title page, being a 
thorough and comprehensive manual of yacht and boat sailing.**— -^S^ttrvfaiy 
Renew. 

'' ... The explanations are made so clear, giving the reason why for 
whatever is stated, that the book cannot fail to be interesting even to the general 
reader, and is of special utility to amateur seamen.**— /r<<A Tim». 

** A book by the author of * Yacht Designing* cannot fail to be instructive ; 
and Mr. Dixon Kemp describes like a professional every minute detail of building, 
rigging, and sailing a yacht One of the very best and most complete books on 
the subject ever published. The various articles on canoes and their manage- 
ment form the most perfect and comprehensive treatise on the subject ever 
published; every little detail is minutely dealt with and thoroughly explained; 
everything required or used for what we may term canoe life is described and 
illustrated.**— /fiin/*« Yachting Magnxine. 

** Apart from the professional chapters, that upon how to select a yacht to 
one of the best.**— ^rifuA Mail. 

**Mr. Kemp may be congratulated on having done so much to enoonrage 
amongst yachtsmen a spirit of inquiry into the principles which govern ^Ea 
design and behaviour of our pleasure fleet.** — Westmuultr IUe«i««.

YACHT ARCHITECTURE. 

By DIXON KEMP. 

Associate of the Institute of Naval Architects. 



rIS WORK enters into the whole subject of the laws which govern 
the resistance of bodies moving in water, and the influence a 
t^ave form of body and wave lines have upon snch resistance. 

It also deals comprehensively with the subject of STEAM 
PEOPULSION as applied to yachts. 

An easy SYSTEM for DESIGNING is provided, and every 
necessary calculation is explained in detail. 

The latter part of the work is devoted to YACHT BUILDING, 
and engravings are given of every detail of construction and fitting, 
including laying off, taking bevels, &o. 

The List of Plates (exclusive of over thirty devoted to the 
elucidation of the text, and nearly two hundred woodcuts) exceeds 
fifty, and comprises the LINES of some of the most CELEBRATED 
YACHTS AFLOAT by the most succesEful builders and designers. 



Oplnioiui of the Pr«M 



** Mr. Horace Cox, London, has published a new edition of Mr. Dixon Eemp*8 
treatise on * Tacht Architecture.* The book, which is aa admirable exposition of 
the whole science and art of designing and building yachts has been roTlied, 
partly re- written, and much enlarged in this edition. No small part of the new 
matter consists of new diagrams and plates. The work has from the first been 
exceptionally rich in thin practical help to ouilders. It now contains probably 
the most complete collection of designs of this kind that have been brought 
together into a book. The text takes notice of all recent improyemente in 
building and of new developments in the scientific theories of propulsion by 
steam and sail. The new edition, on the whole, will keep the book in its place as 
an indispensable work of reference and instruction for builders.*'— 7*^0 SeoUman. 

''One great merit in the second edition of Mr. Kemp's ' Tacht Architecture * is 
that it is in every part written up to time. The chapter on stability is in every 
respect highly satisfactory, technical enough to satisfy the specialist, and yet 
plain enough to inform *he man of ordinary intelligence. So also in regard to 
centre-boards. When the first edition was published, few English yachtsmen 
knew or cared as to what was meant by the term; but the racing for the 
•America' Gi p, and especially the running of the Thistle with the V<Munteer in 
the autumn of 1887, has created quite a new interest in centre boards, and the 
subject is discussed in this edition in a manner at once simple and ladd. The 
ebapteiv devoted to steam yachts are among the m^st satisfactory in the book."

" Mr. Morrison is an Australian doctor who has achieved probably the most 
remarkable journey through the Flowery Land ever attempted by a Christian, 
. . He was entirely unarmed and unaccompanied, save for the coolies who 
canried his baggage. Such a journey— three thouFand miles in length— could 
not fail to present many curious customs and as many curious peoples. But it is 
owing entirely to Dr. Morrison's graphic manner of description, and his acutely 
keen observation, that his travels are such a reality to the reader. This portly 
Tolnme is one of the most interesting books of travel of the many publiehed this 
year. It is frank, original, and quite ungarnishcd by adventitious colouring." —
