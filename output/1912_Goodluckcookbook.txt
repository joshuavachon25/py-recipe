BREAD 



BREAD — Mrs. Fred Charles. 

1 pint hot mashed potatoes. Water. 

1 tablespoon sugar. 1 cake yeast foam. 

3 tablespoons lard. 1 tablespoon salt. 

Flour. 

The day before you wish to bake bread, take one pint of hot 
mashed potatoes and two tablespoons of flour. Scald with a 
pint of hot water. When cold add one cake of yeast foam that 
has been dissolved in one-half cup cold water. Set in a warm 
place. 

In the morning add one quart of warm water and flour 
enough to make a batter. Keep in a warm place and when this 
is light add salt, sugar and lard, and enough flour to knead 
until it does not stick to pan. Set in a warm place and let rise 
twice its size. Mold down but do not add any more flour. 
When light again, form into loaves and when these are light, 
bake in a moderate oven for one hour. It should not brown the 
first twenty minutes. 

The yeast can be made at noon by scalding the flour with 
potato water, then the potatoes can be omitted. 



BREAD — Mrs. Bailey Rosette. 

This recipe will make three medium-sized loaves. Make a 
hole in a pan of flour, about two or three quarts. Put in a 
tablespoon each (level) of sugar, lard and salt. Dissolve one 
compressed yeast cake in a cup of warm water and add to a 
quart of milk and water — half and half. Put the milk, a pint, 
into the quart measure, and fill it up with water hot enough to 
warm the milk, then put in dissolved yeast cake making a run- 
ning-over quart. Add this to flour in pan and beat in enough 
to make stiff batter. Beat this very thoroughly, then cover 
and let stand to rise. 

When it has risen, knead in flour enough so that it will not 
stick to board, and put to rise again until it has about doubled 
in bulk. Then shape into loaves, let rise again and bake about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

BREAD — Mrs. J. V. Mennis. 

Place in a pan of flour one bowl of soft yeast and one of 
warm water. When light, mould into a large loaf, kneading it

well. Let it rise again, then shape into loaves, handling as lit- 
tle as possible. When sufficiently light, bake. This sponge 
can be set in the morning and the bread baked for dinner.

1 cup corn meal (scalded). 1 teaspoon baking powder. 
1 pint sweet milk. Salt. 

3 eggs, beaten light (add Butter, size of an egg (put 
last). in meal while scalding). 

Bake in a shallow pan about 1 1-2 inch thick for one hour in 
a moderate oven. 

SOUTHERN CORN BREAD— Mrs. Bailey Rosette. 

1 cun sweet milk 2 tablespoons white flour. 

1 cup sour milk. 1-2 teaspoon baking powder. 

1-2 teaspoon soda. Butter size of an egg. 

1 egg. 1 teaspoon salt. 
1 1-2 cups cornmeal. 

Dissolve soda in sour milk, beat an egg light, pour milk into 
this, stir in corn meal and flour into which put baking powder. 
Put pan on the stove with butter, when melted, pour into the 
batter and add salt. The butter will grease the pan and form 
a crispy top. Bake about half an hour. 

SOUTHERN BATTER BREAD— Mrs. Norman. 

1-2 cup white cornmeal. 1 dessert spoon lard, butter 
1 cup cold boiled little hominy or baking drippings. 

(grit). 2 eggs. 

1 teaspoon salt. 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

Scald meal, with salt and lard added, add grits and eggs, 
slightly beaten; add sweet milk to make a very thin batter. 



Cook in gi-eased baking dish until it is a golden brown. Help 
with a spoon. 

Buttermilk and soda are even better than sweet milk and 
baking powder, but you have to experiment as to the quantity 
of soda. The less the better, is my experience. 

This recipe is good without the grits, and 1-2 cup of rice 
makes still another good batter bread, used instead of the 
little hominy. 

This recipe is also nice for corn muffins. The muffin rings 
must be well greased. It is also a reliable recipe for corn bat- 
ter cakes. These cakes require great deftness, as the batter 
must be very thin. 

Points to remember about making corn bread are: — Use 
White meal. Use plenty of shortening and grease the pans 
well. For batter breads, cake or muffins, nobody ever used too 
many eggs or too little meal. 

Never use sugar, or molasses in making corn breads. 

SOUTHERN BEAT BISCUIT— Mrs. Norman. 

1 quart sifted flour. 1 teaspoon salt. 

1 round tablespoon lard. 3-4 cup water or milk. 

Make into stiff dough. Put on a solid block and beat with a 
heavy maul until it blisters. (The Southern cook's rule is 
"Two hundred licks for every day and five hundred for com- 
pany"). Cut out with small biscuit cutter and bake in moderate 
oven. They should be white, not brown, when done. A fairly 
good imitation of real "beat biscuit" can be made by running 
the dough made by this recipe repeatedly through the kitchen 
grinder.
