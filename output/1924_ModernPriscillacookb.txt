MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 



ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS 



The Priscilla Cook Book is an 
authority based on actual tests, 
for such accurate culinary infor- 
mation as the homemaker of to- 
day requires, and insists upon: 



Accurate measurements. 

The temperature at which the 
dish should be cooked. 

The length of the cooking 
period. 



ADVANTAGES OF ACCURACY 



Money Saving. — " Bad Luck " 
caused more waste in the old- 
fashioned kitchen than any other 
one cause. Certainty in place of 
guessing eliminates failures. 

Time Saving. — If we know just 
how long a dish should be cooked, 
and at just what temperature the 



oven should be held, the time we 
used to spend hovering near the 
stove to " see how it is coming 
along " is saved for something 
more profitable. 

Mental Relief. — A feeling of 
confidence takes considerable 
strain from a busy woman's mind. 



EQUIPMENT 



To secure accuracy, every 
kitchen should contain the follow- 
ing equipment: 

Measuring spoons. — Convenient 
aluminum spoons plainly 
marked with the quantities they 
hold may be bought anywhere 
for about ten cents. 
Measuring cups. — Two of these 
are sufficient. Both may be of 
glass or of aluminum, but we 



find an aluminum cup for dry 
ingredients and a glass one for 
liquids most convenient^ Each 
is plainly marked with thirds 
and quarter cups. 
A small spatula for leveling. — 
The back of a knife will do 
equally well, but the spatula 
has so many other uses that 
its purchase is not an extrava- 
gance. 



MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 



STANDARD PRACTICE 

All measurements in this book are level. Tablespoon, teaspoon, etc., 
mean standard measuring spoons level full. Tableware will not do, 
for almost every different make and pattern holds a different quantity. 

Another thing the accurate cook must not do is to shake down 
dry ingredients in the cup while they are being measured. Put the 
materials into the cup lightly with a spoon until it is heaped, then 
level the cup with a spatula. 

Besides measuring ingredients with exactness, it is necessary to follow 
carefully the directions for combining. Accurate measurement lays the 
foundation for success in cookery, but the method used in putting them 
together is also important in the final result. 

TIME AND TEMPERATURE 

The time in cooking and the temperature given in each recipe is 
that actually used when the recipe was tested at the Priscilla Prov- 
ing Plant. In using utensils of varying dimensions slight changes in 
the cooking period may be found necessary. For instance, cake 
batter baked in a deep narrow pan requires a longer time to cook 
thoroughly than an equal amount of the same batter spread out in 
a broad, shallow pan. 

For accuracy in baking an automatic oven-heat control is the ideal. 
Unless the oven is equipped with such a device the only way to de- 
termine the temperature with any degree of accuracy is by the use of 
an oven thermometer. The type of indicator which is built into the 
oven door of many ranges cannot be depended upon absolutely. With 
continued use it becomes less and less accurate. 



PRISCILLA PROVING PLANT SCALE 
OF OVEN TEMPERATURES

300°-350° Moderate 

350°-400° Moderately hot 

400°-450° Hot 

450°-550° Very hot 

SERVINGS 

The number of servings which each recipe will make is also a variable 
quantity, depending on the place of the dish in the menu, the accom- 
panying dishes, and the food habits of the family.

THIS FOR THAT 

MILK 

Evaporated milk, diluted with an equal measure of water, or dried 
milk reconstituted according to the directions on the package, may- 
be used successfully in place of fresh milk in any recipe. 

Condensed milk, a sweetened product, may be used in place of sugar 
and milk in sweetened mixtures, such as desserts (cornstarch, tapioca, 
rice, and gelatine), and cocoa. More sugar may be added if desired. 

Where milk is used chiefly because it is a liquid and only second- 
arily because it is milk, water will do quite as well. In cakes and 
biscuits, for instance, this substitution will be unnoticed. 

Other liquids too will answer. Potato water gives a moistness in 
cake and bread that is desirable. Rice water is often available. It 
is especially good in soups and gravies. Fruit juices may be used 
in cakes with very pleasing results as to flavor if the acid is neutral- 
ized with a little soda. The exact amount would need to be deter- 
mined for each particular case. One-half teaspoon to a cup will be 
satisfactory in the majority of cases. Coffee is delicious in cakes, 
miiffins, and in place of part of the milk in desserts. 

If the milk you planned to use has soured it can be made just aa 
good for baking by the addition of soda. One-half teaspoon to a cup 
is the average amount necessary. 



SOUR MILK AND LEMON JUICE 

It frequently happens that there is no sour milk on hand when the 
recipe calls for it. The addition of vinegar or lemon juice to sweet 
milk makes a satisfactory substitute. One tablespoon of acid to one 
cup milk will give a mixture the acidity of which will be neutralized 
by one-half teaspoon of soda to a cup of the milk. This is the 
acidity of the average sour milk. 

In most recipes sweet milk may be used instead of sour, using two 
teaspoons baking powder in place of every half teaspoon of soda 
called for in the recipe. If the recipe uses molasses and sour milk, 
as many sour milk recipes do, instead of substituting baking powder 
for all the soda, use enough soda to neutralize the acid of the 
molasses (one teaspoon to a cup) and substitute for the rest. 

In salad dressings lemon juice and vinegar are readily interchange- 
able. For a fruit salad, orange or grapefruit juice give a pleasing 
flavor. 

In desserts and beverages any acid fruit juice may be used to 
advantage. 

An excellent " lemon pie " can be produced without a lemon by 
using bottled lime juice.

CREAM — CHOCOLATE — FROSTING 

Evaporated cream and evaporated milk, undiluted, are often used 
to take the place of cream. In coffee they have attained to pop- 
ularity and are served regularly in many homes. In cooking they 
may also be used. 

In thickened mixtures, soups, cream sauces, dessert foundations, 
milk, even skimmed milk, given a creamy tint with a bit of yellow 
coloring will often pass unquestioned. A little butter will help 
supply the fat content and make the flavor more like that of cream. 

Cocoa plus fat equals chocolate, a fact which makes substitution 
very simple. Two tablespoons of cocoa and a teaspoon of fat will 
give approximately the food value of an ounce of chocolate. The 
flavor is almost exactly duplicated. 

When you want to frost a cake and have no sugar, there are 
several possibilities. 

Condensed milk thickened with powdered cocoa until of the right 
consistency to spread makes a delicious chocolate frosting. 

Marshmallow cream is much used with cakes. 

Jam or jelly sprinkled thickly with nuts or cocoanut is a welcome 
change from ordinary frosting. 



SHORTENING 

Any one fat may be substituted for any other. 

The various cooking fats and oils which are prepared commercially 
are similar in action, though they differ in flavor. They may be 
used interchangeably or substituted for butter or margarine by de- 
creasing the amount two tablespoons to the cup. Good drippings 
may be used in the same way. Of course the flavor must be con- 
sidered. Ham, bacon, and mutton are not easily disguised unless 
used in a highly spiced mixture. Do not forget to add a pinch of 
salt when substituting an unsalted fat for a salted one. 

To increase the quantity of frying fat, drippings again come in 
play. Mutton, ham, bacon, or even sausage fat in small quantities 
cannot be detected. For croquettes, cutlets and potatoes, the flavor 
is not objectionable and larger amounts may be used. 



EGGS 

One is especially likely to find the cupboard destitute of eggs — and 
sometimes they are so high in price and so difficult to obtain that 
one does not pretend to keep them on hand. 

As a leavening agent baking powder may be used, substituting one 
teaspoon in place of each egg omitted. It is not advisable to try 
to substitute for more than two eggs. If you have no eggs and must 
make a cake, choose a one-egg cake rather than a four-egg recipe 



THIS FOR THAT g 

as a foundation. Or, better still, try a dark eggless cake. A recipe 
for an eggless chocolate cake will be found on page 67. 

It is a great convenience to have dried egg whites on hand. When- 
ever you have an egg white left, place it on a plate and leave in a 
warm place until thoroughly dried, scrape off the crystals which will 
have formed and store in jars. A tablespoon of the powder dissolved 
in two tablespoons of water will equal one egg white. It beats up 
perfectly. 

For thickening, a tablespoon of flour or half a tablespoon of corn- 
starch will take the place of one egg. A little yellow coloring will 
conceal the substitution from the eye. 

Evaporated milk undiluted is really superior to milk for glazing. 
For dipping croquettes for frying it gives excellent results. 

WHIPPED CREAM 

Evaporated cream will whip, and evaporated milk may be beaten 
stiff if subjected to a certain process. 

Put the milk in a bowl and set the bowl in a larger bowl or pan 
partly filled with cracked ice to which has been added one-fourth its 
amount of ice-cream salt. Let the milk chill for five minutes, then 
beat with an ordinary egg-beater. It should take ten minutes' beating 
to make a thick whip and in that time the milk will have increased 
to three times its original bulk. You will have a thick, creamy whip 
which is ready for use in cooking. For use on the table as whipped 
cream, add to one and one-half cups of the cream whip, three- 
quarters teaspoon of vanilla, one and one-half tablespoons sugar, a 
pinch of salt. Dissolve one-half teaspoon granulated gelatine which 
has been soaked in one tablespoon of hot water and add to the 
cream, whip again for a few minutes and chill. 

Marshmallow Cream is a good topping in place of whipped cream. 

On custards, baked puddings, or pastry meringue is a good sub- 
stitute for whipped cream. It may be baked on a dessert or on a 
dish of water and transferred to any dish for serving. 

Fruit whip is delicious and not unlike stiffly beaten cream in 
texture. One egg white, one-half cup sugar, and one-half cup fruit 
pulp makes a cup and a half of the whip. Raw apple pulp makes 
a whip very delicate in flavor that combines well with almost any- 
thing. Any raw or cooked fruit puree may be used. 



SUGAR AND SYRUPS 

Syrups and honey may be used very satisfactorily in place of half 
the sugar in a recipe. They give a different texture, flavor, and 
intensity of sweetness from sugar, and if used in too large amount? 
are not acceptable. 



10 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

In using brown, powdered, or confectioners' sugar in the place of 
white the substitution should be made by weight, not measure. Ap- 
proximately one and one-third cups of brown sugar, or one and one- 
quarter cups of confectioners' sugar is equivalent to one cup of 
granulated. 

For desserts and beverages condensed milk or sweet chocolate may 
be used to supply the sugar. 

The different syrups may be substituted one for aD other by exer- 
cising a little judgment. 

A brown sugar syrup is similar to molasses in flavor but is less 
acid. Syrup made by caramelizing sugar gives the same brown color, 
but is distinctive in flavor and entirely free from acid, so that, in 
baking, baking powder should be used with it in place of soda. 

Maple syrup has an inimitable flavor. Brown sugar syrup flavored 
with vanilla and a light caramel syrup with maple flavoring approach 
it, and are good on pancakes and waffles. 



BAKING POWDER 

The use of soda and cream of tartar instead of baking powder is 
very common, for many baking powders are made up of just those 
ingredients. The correct proportion is two parts of cream of tartar 
to one part soda. Three-quarters of a teaspoon of the mixture is 
equal to one teaspoon of baking powder, the seeming discrepancy in 
the figures being accounted for by the fillers in commercially pre- 
pared baking powders. 

Soda with any acid liquid will liberate carbon dioxide, the leavening 
agent furnished by baking powder. Substitute sour milk or acid fruit 
juice for sweet milk, or use a molasses recipe. 



FLOUR 

The characteristic action of flour is due to the gluten which it 
contains. Wheat flour is richer in gluten than the other flours, and 
really good results in baking cannot be obtained by substituting for 
the whole amount called for. 

If one has no white flour, whole wheat is the most satisfactory 
substitute. Cakes and muffins made with entire wheat flour and 
camouflaged with spices will often be passed by an unsuspecting 
family. 

Crumbs of all sorts may be used to advantage for part of the flour 
in dark breads, steamed puddings, cakes, and cookies. This substi- 
tution, by the way, furnishes an excellent opportunity for using the 
crumbs that always seem to accumulate in distressingly large amounts. 

Cereals are excellent for thickening soups and gravies, the propor- 
tion depending on the kind of cereal and whether it has been pre- 
viously cooked. 



THIS FOR THAT 11 

The substitution of bread flour for pastry is simple. One cup of 
pasti-y flour is equal to one cup of bread flour minus two tablespoons. 



FLAVORINGS 

One often finds oneself without certain flavorings, but it is some- 
times possible to imitate them. 

Vanilla and almond give pistachio. The combination of rose and 
almond results in a flavor very like sherry. 

Orange or lemon peel may be used in place of the extracts. 

In steamed pudding or fruit cake, orange marmalade will take the 
place of candied peel. 

STOCK 

Stock is largely a matter of liquid and seasoning, and substitutes 
are easily found. 

Bouillon cubes, meat and vegetable extracts dissolved in water 
make excellent stock. 

Canned bouillon or consomme are perfectly satisfactory. 

Vegetable juices, fresh and canned, should be saved and used in 
place of part of the stock called for. 

Plain water, judiciously seasoned with salt, pepper, celery, onion 
salt, parsley, and so forth, and colored with a little caramel may 
pass for stock. Caramel used for coloring should be very dark and at 
best it will change the flavor slightly. 



CHICKEN— MUSHROOMS — CELERY 

Mushrooms are often unavailable and are always a luxury. Cooked 
celery cut in small pieces may be used very successfully instead. 

Instead of chicken use veal or pork cut in cubes, or tuna fish. 
Many a tuna fish salad has passed as chicken. 

In uncooked mixtures, crisp cabbage cut fine may take the place 
of celery. A little celery salt or celery seed helps along the de- 
ception. 

Dried celery leaves as well as the salt and seed may furnish the 
celery flavor to cooked mixtures. 

It is an excellent plan to save the best leaves of every bunch of 
celery, dry them thoroughly and pulverize. The powder may then 
be kept in a salt-shaker and used in place of celery salt. Dried 
parsley will also be found worth the trouble of preparation-

BEVERAGES 

Facts to Remember in Beverage Making 

Cocoa, coffee, and tea all act as stimulants to a slight degree; but 
if properly prepared they can be taken in moderate amounts by a 
normal adult with no injurious effects. 

Cocoa and chocolate have a high nutritive value in themselves, and 
when prepared with milk they are still more important as foods. 

Both cocoa and chocolate are improved by boiling for a few minutes 
in a small quantity of water. The cooking brings out the flavor of the 
chocolate and makes the starch which the products contain more eerily 
ed. 

Boiled Cojjce. — Boiling is probably the method of coffee making in 
commonest use. It is the most economical in coffee,, but it pre 
the least delicacy of flavor and develops the largest amount of ta 
acid. For it use coffee coarsely ground. Allow a level tablespoon of 
coffee for each cup to be served, and one extra for the pot. An egg. 
if the food budget allows it. is also called for. If a whole egg c 
be spared, shells of the eggs, used in routine cookery, carefully washed 
before breaking, will do nearly as well. 

x the coffee well with the slightly beaten egg, or with the 
shells, and add one cup of cold water. Stir all together and let if 
while the rest of the water is being heated. As soon as it comes to a 
jumping boil pour it over the mixture in the coffee-pot and let it boil 
not longer than three minutes. 

Stuff the spout with paper towelling or a bit of immaculate ch 
cloth while the boiling goes on, unless j'ou have the sort of coffee-pot 
in which the closing of the spout is provided for in the pot itself. 

The egg clears the coffee, but two tablespoons of cold water added 
just before the coffee goes to the table will complete the process. 

Percolator Cofiee. — For percolating, the coffee should be ground 
more finely than for the preceding process. The consistency of granu- 
lated sugar is about right. Allow one tablespoon (level) for each cup. 
Either cold or hot water may be used in the percolator. Each has 
its advoc- prefer to start with cold water and after the perco- 

lator begins to " plurp ■ we keep it going for five minutes. Coffee, in 
p rocess as in both the others, should be served immediately to be 
at Hi best

16 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

Drip Coffee. — Dripping or filtering is the method beloved by epicures 
and favored by scientists. Coffee for it should be ground to the same 
texture as fine corn meal. It should feel a bit gritty when rubbed be- 
tween the fingers. Pulverized coffee ground as fine as flour is too fine. 
It mats together and prevents the free penetration of water to extract 
flavor. A percolator may be used to hold the coffee, but unless the 
holes in the container are minute, cotton flannel, fuzz side up, or fine, 
firm muslin is better. Use a tablespoon of coffee for each cup, put the 
coffee in the container, take the required amount of water brought to 
a jumping boil, and pour it slowly through the coffee. If this does 
not make the flavor strong enough to suit the family either increase 
the amount of coffee or pour the water through a second time. The 
more epicurean of coffee drinkers say that a second pouring spoils 
the delicacy of flavor. No egg is needed for clearing. If the " drip " 
is fine enough the coffee will be clear. 

One caution is necessary if you use a cloth drip. Let it be wide and 
shallow. A long conical drip does not allow the water to penetrate 
among the coffee particles as it should. For perfection in this method 
no metal must touch the coffee while the " drip " is in process. Use a 
glass, pottery or enamel pot. 



TEA 

Great care is the price of a really good cup of tea. 

Tea should be kept in a tightly covered tin or jar. 

The teapot, which should be of porcelain or earthenware, should 
always be scalded before being used. 

Water used in making tea should be freshly boiled. Water boils 
when the entire surface breaks into bubbles. 

Tea should never be allowed to boil. 

Use the proportion of about one teaspoon of tea to one cup of 
water, this amount depending upon the kind of tea used and the 
strength desired. 

Allow the tea to stand from one to five minutes in a hot place, 
this time also depending upon the kind of tea used. Five minutes 
is usually the maximum time, as after that, injurious qualities are 
produced. 

A properly prepared brew of tea is never left standing on the leaves, 
but is strained off into a well-heated teapot or tea-urn.

A DELICIOUS TEA PUNCH 

2 cups sugar 1 pint cherry juice 

2 cups water 1 cup grated pineapple 

1 pint tea infusion 1 quart Apollinaris or other 

4 lemons (juice) charged water 

4 oranges (juice) Iced water 

Boil the sugar and the two cups of water together for ten 
minutes; when this is cold, add the tea infusion, using only 
the best tea to make this. Add the fruit juices, pineapple, 
and let stand a while. Then add the charged water, and 
enough iced water to make the desired strength. Servings, 25. 



FRUIT BEVERAGES 

Fruit beverages are most refreshing and healthful. When made 
of only one kind of fruit, they are called "ades," — lemonade, orange- 
ade, pineappleade, etc., and when made of a combination of fruit 
juices they are spoken of as " punches." 

Summer beverages are better and more quickly made if sweetened 
with a sugar syrup instead of granulated sugar. This syrup should be 
made ahead and kept on hand in a covered jar or a bottle. To make 
it, measure equal parts of sugar and water into a saucepan, place over 
the fire and stir until the sugar is dissolved, then let it boil without 
stirring for six or eight minutes. Cool and bottle. This blends more 
readily with the beverage than sugar and also gives a better body. 

A plain lemonade may be " dressed up " with sprigs of mint, or 
cold tea, or grape juice, and the result is a good punch without 
using many ingredients. 

A dash or two of soda-water which may be bought in a siphon at 
a druggist's, adds greatly to any drink; or we may add bottled 
charged water. Ginger ale, as well as charged water, gives a zest 
to all of these drinks. 

CHERRY PUNCH 

2 quarts white cherries 1 cup grated pineapple 

2 cups water 1 cup tea infusion 

2 cups sugar 1 quart carbonated water 

6 oranges % teaspoon almond extract 

Cover the cherries with the water and cook until the cherries 
are reduced to a pulp. Strain to remove skins and stones. 



FRUIT BEVERAGES 21 

Add the sugar and cook for about ten minutes; cool and add 
the juice of the oranges and pineapple. Place on ice to 
chill and ripen. Add the tea, carbonated water, and almond 
extract, and sufficient cold water to make the desired 
strength. Place in a punch bowl with a block of ice and 
garnish with a few whole cherries. Red cherries may be 
used for this punch instead of white cherries. Servings, 25. 

SWEET CIDER PUNCH 

1 cup sugar 1 quart sweet cider 

1 pint water 1 pint grape juice 

3 lemons 

Place the sugar in the water and boil for about ten minutes, 
adding a little of the outer lemon rind. When cold add

LEMONADE SYRUP 

2 cups sugar 6 lemons 

1 pint water 

Cook the sugar and water together without stirring until it 
is a thick syrup, adding the grated outer rind of one of the 
lemons. When this is cool, add the juice of the lemons, and 
bottle. By diluting with ice water you may have lemonade 
at short notice. This syrup may also be used as a basis of 
many cooling drinks. By adding grape juice, you have 
grape- juice lemonade. A dozen sprigs of fresh spearmint 
added to a quart of lemonade will give you another flavor. 
Tea lemonade is made by taking a cup of the lemonade syrup 
and adding to it a pint of tea infusion, a quart of ice water, 
and, if liked, a fourth cup of orange or pineapple juice. 
You can make the lemonade syrup in any quantity you wish. 
Some people make the thick syrup, and add the lemon juice 
when making up the lemonade.

BREADS 

Facts to Remember about Bread Making 

The only essential ingredients in bread making are flour, yeast, and 
liquid. 

Flour made from hard or spring wheat, because it contains a larger 
proportion of gluten than soft or winter wheat flour, gives a dough 
that is elastic. For this reason it is preferred for breads in which yeast 
is the leavening agent. 

The liquid may be milk, water, or potato water, or a mixture of the 
three. The larger the proportion of milk the greater the nutritive £ 
value of the loaf. The use of potato water hastens the action of the 
yeast and gives a loaf that does not dry quickly. 

Yeast may be compressed or dry. The compressed cake, which must 
be used while fresh, is the most convenient form whenever it can be 
secured, because it acts rapidly. Dry yeast will keep indefinitely and 
on that account it is the most satisfactory form for households not 
near the market. In the diy yeast the yeast plants have become in- 
active and a longer time is required for the bread making process. 

Potato yeast, which is started with a dry yeast cake is convenient 
to have on hand, and may be used very successfully by an experienced 
cook. Grate a raw potato, pour a little boiling water over it, and 
cook to a thick paste. When cool, add a little salt and sugar and a 
dry yeast cake, or part of one. Leave the mixture in a warm place 
for several hours until it is light and foamy. This kind of yeast takes 
the place of the yeast cake and part of the liquid in mixing bread. 

A little salt is added to bread dough to prevent the growth of un- 
desirable ferments and to give flavor to the bread. Too large a pro- 
portion of salt retards the action of the yeast. 

It is not necessary to use sugar in bread making. A little is usually 
added however because it hastens the fermentation process and the 
flavor is generally liked. A very large amount retards the process. 

Shortening as well adds a desirable flavor to bread. It also makes 
the dough tender, and helps to keep the loaf moist. An excess of 
shortening tends to retard the rising. 

Too high a temperature kills the yeast plants, while cold renders 
them inactive. Yeast acts most rapidly at ordinary room temperature.

BREAD RING AND BRAID 

2% cups milk 2 tablespoons sugar or honey 

1 yeast cake (dry or com- 1 egg 

pressed) % teaspoon salt 

Flour 1 teaspoon almond extract 

% cup shortening 

The milk should be scalded, and cooled until lukewarm. 
Dissolve the yeast cake in one-half cup of it. Then add one- 
half cup of flour. Mix thoroughly by beating and let rise. 
When it has doubled its bulk add four and one-half cups 
of flour and repeat the rising process. Next add all the other 
ingredients and flour to make a dough just stiff enough to 
handle (probably about one and one-half cups will be needed). 
Toss on a floured surface, knead, cover, and let rise a third 
time. 

TO MAKE A RING 

Roll out the dough as thinly as possible, spread with 
melted butter and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. 

Roll like a jelly roll. The dough will probably stick and 
have to be coaxed to roll with a knife. 

Stretch if necessary to make it long enough to form a good 
ring. 

Cut a piece from each end and join the two ends to make 
a circle. 

Cut at regular intervals with the kitchen shears from out- 
side edge almost to center. 

TO MAKE A BRAID 

Cut three pieces of dough of equal size. 

Roll them into equal lengths with the hands. 

Fasten three ends together and braid evenly. 

The braid may be put on a greased baking sheet or shaped 
around a circular dish. Let the braid rise, brush it with an 
egg yolk, beaten and diluted with half a tablespoon of cold

QUICK BREADS 

The chief difference between quick breads and yeast breads is in the 
leavening agent. Quick breads are made light by a gas liberated 
through the chemical action of an acid on an alkali, or by the in- 
corporation of air into the batter or dough. The action of these forms 
of leavening is much more rapid than that of yeast, making it possible 
to prepare the breads very quickly and easily. 

Baking powder is the leavening agent most commonly used in quick 
breads. It is a combination of sodium bicarbonate (ordinary baking 
soda) and some form of acid, with a filler of starch to prevent the 
ingredients from absorbing moisture and acting on each other during 
storage in the can. 

There are three types of baking powder — cream of tartar, phosphate, 
and alum. The name is derived in each case from the acid used in 
the powder. Much has been said against each variety but in the 
quantities in which they are used there is no possible harm in any one 
of them. Choice should be made according to price and action. Cream 
of tartar powders are less readily soluble than the others and so contain 
less filler. Phosphate powders act rapidly. With the alum powders 
the action is slower and so gas is developed more continuously. 

It is possible for the housekeeper to make her own baking powder 
by mixing two parts of cream of tartar with one of soda, but it is not 
advisable except as an emergency measure. The commercially pre- 
pared products are combined with laboratory precision and are far 
more dependable. 

All cooks are familiar with the use of soda with sour milk or molasses 
for leavening purposes. The principle is the same as that of baking 
powder, that is the action of soda and an acid to produce a gas. It 
is impossible to be absolutely accurate in the use of this form of 
measuring, because the degree of acidity in sour milk and molasses 
is variable. The general rule is to use half a teaspoonful to each cup 
of molasses. 

When air is used as a leavening agent it is incorporated into the 
mixture by beating the batter directly, or by adding eggs which have 
already been beaten. 

The proportion of liquid to flour in quick breads depends chiefly 
upon the method of baking. 

For breads which are baked in loaves, and for biscuits that must 
retain their shape in baking, a soft dough is used. This is a mixture 
containing approximately three cups of flour to one of liquid. 

38 



QUICK BREADS 39 

A thick batter — a mixture containing from one and a half to two 
and a half cups of flour to every cup of liquid — is used for mu ffi ns 
and drop biscuits. 

Hot breads which are cooked in thin sheets like griddle cakes and 
waffles require a thin batter, made with practically equal parts of 
liquid and flour. Popovers, also, are made with a thin batter. 

Slight variations will have to be made in these general proportions, 
depending upon the other ingredients used. A batter or dough con- 
taining sugar, shortening, nuts, or fruit requires more flour than one 
less rich. Differences in the thickening powers of flour must also be 
considered.

CRULLERS, DOUGHNUTS AND 
FRITTERS 

Facts to Remember 

The products of deep fat frying have a reputation for indigestibility 
which is deserved only when there is something wrong with the pro- 
cedure. One difficulty is that under certain conditions foods absorb 
more fat in frying than can be easily taken care of by the digestion, 
and another, that at a certain temperature, differing with each kind of 
fat, a change takes place which develops an indigestible product called 
acreolin. This is recognizable by its acrid odor. Fat should never be 
used after it has reached this point. 

The temperature of the fat is of utmost importance in frying. If 
it is not hot enough the food absorbs fat; if too hot the outside browns 
before the inner part is thoroughly cooked. A thermometer is essential 
for the inexperienced cook in controlling the temperature, and is 
advisable in any case. 

Next to the frying temperature, experience in handling the dough 
is the most important point in successful doughnut making. 

Dough which has been chilled can be more easily handled and ab- 
sorbs less fat than the same dough at room temperature. 

In putting doughnuts into the fat, have the part which has been 
next to the molding board uppermost. 

Only a few doughnuts or fritters should be fried at one time, because 
the cold dough cools the fat rapidly. 

Fried foods should be drained on absorbent paper. 

There is no marked difference in the amount of absorption power 
for the various fats and oils in common use,

GRIDDLE CAKES, MUFFINS AND 
WAFFLES 

Facts to Remember 

The pancake griddle should be just hot enough to allow drops of 
cold water sprinkled on its surface to keep their shape for a few 
seconds. If the drops spread out on the griddle the temperature is too 
low. If they break up and evaporate immediately the temperature is 
too high. When a griddle thermometer is used it should register 225 
degrees F. 

A waffle iron is tested for temperature in the same way as a pan- 
cake griddle. Waffle molds should be thoroughly heated on both sides 
before the batter is poured in. Iron molds must be greased before 
each waffle is cooked. Aluminum molds do not require greasing. 

It is convenient to pour pancake and waffle batter from a pitcher. 

Pans of a heavy material are best for baking popovers. They may 
be of iron, earthen-ware, or glass. The pans should be heated before 
using. 

Stale muffins may be freshened very satisfactorily by dipping quickly 
in hot water and putting in a hot oven for a few minutes, or they 
may be split and toasted.

CAKE, COOKIES AND GINGERBREAD 

Facts to Remember about Cake Making 

However wide the apparent variety there are only two kinds of 
cake; butter cakes, which contain fat of some kind, and sponge cakes, 
which are made without fat. Butter cakes usually depend upon a 
chemical leavening agent, while in sponge cakes air incorporated in 
beaten eggs supplies the leavening. 

Variety in cakes is obtained by combining the ingredients in different 
proportions, by using different flavors and spices and by adding en- 
riching ingredients like fruit and nuts. Raised cake, made with a 
foundation of bread dough, comes in the class of butter cakes. 

Pastry flour, because of its large proportion of starch, makes lighter 
and more tender cake than does bread flour. For the very best results 
the flours milled especially for cake making, from wheat high in starch, 
are to be recommended. 

Careful mixing is of the utmost importance in cake making. For 
example, one of the commonest faults in the mixing of butter cakes 
is insufficient creaming of the shortening and sugar. The shortening 
should be creamed until it is very soft, and the sugar added gradually. 
The whole mass should be kept light and fluffy. Eggs should be 
thoroughly beaten before adding, and the batter should be beaten 
after the flour is added. With sponge cakes, the egg yolks, flour, and 
sugar should be thoroughly blended to insure a fine texture. Egg 
whites should be folded in gently so that the air which they hold will 
be retained. 

Divide the baking time for cake into quarters: (1) During the first 
quarter the cake should begin to rise, and at the end of that time the 
portion nearest the tin should be higher than the rest, and bubbles 
should show over the top. (2) During the second quarter the rising 
should continue, and the cake should appear slightly baked next to 
the tin, with bubbles still showing through the centre. (3) During 
the third quarter the baked appearance should extend over the top, 
and browning should take place. (4) During the last quarter the cake 
should finish browning and shrink from the tin. Opening the oven 
door and moving the cake gently is safe after the first half of the 
baking time is over. 

The most common baking fault is too hot an oven. In too hot an 
oven the cake bakes (and sometimes burns) next the pan and over the 

63 



64 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

top, before the rising is complete. As a result the gas, which continues 
to expand, either humps the cake in the place where the heat is lowest., 
or makes a crack there through which the expanding batter can escape. 

The oven temperature varies with the nature of the batter and the 
form in which it is baked. A very rich cake requires a slower oven 
than a simpler cake does. A cake containing molasses tends to burn 
easily, and therefore needs to be baked more slowly than a similar 
mixture made with white sugar. A loaf should be baked at a lower 
temperature than a thin sheet or individual cakes. Sponge and angel 
cake require a very moderate oven. 

Variations of any plain cake recipe may be made in the following 
waj-s : 

Add enriching ingredients to the recipe, chopped nuts, raisins, bits 
of candied fruit, separately or in combination. Berries and fresh 
fruits may also be used. 

Use the vegetable colorings. In combination with a change of 
flavoring these are especially effective for " show cakes." 

Variety in shape may be had by baking the cake in a high, narrow 
tin, in a broad shallow tin, in muffin tins (large and small), in layer 
cake-pans, and in well-greased jelly molds.

CEREALS 

Points to Remember about Cereals 

Cereal products, taken as a whole, furnish greater nutritive value 
a given expenditure than any other class of food. 

The most widely distributed breakfast cereals in our country are 
wheat, oats, and corn. We are familiar with them as whole grains, in 
cracked form, made into flakes, or ground into grits or meal. Barley, 
rye, and rice also appear on the breakfast table. Many of the prepared 
cereals are combinations of different grains. 

Rice is extensively used in combination with meat, cheese, or vege- 
tables as a main dish for luncheon or dinner, and also has a place in 
the making of desserts. 

Macaroni and spaghetti are flour products belonging in the cereal 
class. They are used chiefly like rice in the preparation of luncheon 
dishes. 

Whole grains and those containing the bran coating are particularly 
valuable in the dietary because they furnish minerals and vitamines 
that are not found in the highly refined products. 

Cereals should be very thoroughly cooked in order to break open 
the starch cells. All starchy foods are difficult of digestion unless the 
cell walls are broken down in preparation. It is especially important 
to consider this point in preparing cereals for babies. 

The tireless cooker is an ideal device in which to prepare cereals. 
A double boiler gives equally good results and if used over a simmer- 
ing burner is not extravagant of fuel. Cereals may be cooked more 
quickly by boiling, but the danger of burning makes constant watching 
necessary. 

Before the cereal mixture is put into the tireless cooker or double 
boiler, it should be brought to the boiling point and cooked with con- 
stant stirring until slightly thickened. 

To prevent lumping, the dry cereal should be sprinkled slowly into 
rapidly boiling water or mixed with a little cold water before the 
boiling water is added. 

Left-over cereal may be molded in small cups and served as dessert 
with fruit, whipped cream, or a sweet sauce. Or it may be molded in 
a loaf, sliced, sauted in fat, and served with sugar or syrup.

A GOOD BREAKFAST CEREAL 

1 cup bran 1 quart water 

1 cup rolled oats % cup farina 

1 teaspoon salt 

Add the bran and oats to the salted boiling water, and cook 
in a double boiler four hours. Then add the farina and 
continue the cooking for one hour more. Servings, 10. 

CORN MEAL MUSH 

1 cup corn meal 1 cup cold water 

1 teaspoon salt 3 cups boiling water 

Mix together corn meal, salt, and cold water, add boiling 
water and stir until smooth and boiling. Cook in a double 
boiler three hours or more. Serve with whole milk, or butter 
and syrup, for breakfast, luncheon or supper. Servings, 6. 

HOMINY 

1 cup hominy grits Salt to taste 

4 cups water 

Add the hominy grits to the four cups of salted water. Cook 
for twenty-five minutes directly over the blaze, stirring con- 
stantly, or for forty-five minutes in a double boiler. Longer 
cooking destroys the flavor. Servings, 6. 

SAMP 

1 cup samp Salt to taste 

1 quart water 

Wash samp and soak over night in the water. Kext day cook 
gently in the same water for five hours. A double boiler is 
best for the process. Do not boil, because hard cooking 
makes samp tough. It can be used as a cereal or as a vege- 
table. Cooked in a casserole mixed with cheese, or meat, 
or tomato, it is delicious. Servings, 6.

Facta to Remember in Candy Making 

For uniform results in candy making a thermometer is indispensable. 
A test made by dropping a little of the syrup in cold water serves to 
some extent as a guide, but even in the hands of an experienced candy 
maker it is necessarily more or less inaccurate. 

The following table gives the cold water test for sugar syrup and 
the corresponding degree on the thermometer.

The candy kettle should have a perfectly smooth inner surface and 
be preferably of heavy material so that the syrup will not stick and 
scorch. 

To prevent the graining of candies like fudge, penuchi and fondant, 
which ought to be creamy in texture, the syrup should be cooled until 
lukewarm before it is beaten. 

A clear cool day is best for candy making. 

GRILLED ALMONDS, CALIFORNIA STYLE 



1 cup almonds

2 tablespoons orange juice 
2 tablespoons lemon juice 



Blanch almonds and dry them thoroughly. Boil sugar and 
fruit juices until the syrup forms a long thread when dropped 
from a spoon. Add almonds and let cook to hard crack stage. 
Remove instantly and stir until it sugars. Cool and separate 
the almonds to which the sugar will cling irregularly.

DESSERTS 

The choice of dessert is one of the most perplexing questions for the 
menu-maker to decide. In its proper function it is intended to make 
the meal more attractive and to complete it from dietary standards. 
the character of the dessert that is most likely to be disregarded. 
Too often a heavy dessert is added to a meal already high in food 
value just because we have acquired the habit of ending a meal with 
a sweet. It is important that the menu-maker have at her command 
a large number of ideas for desserts to enable her to maintain a proper 
balance in meals of widely differing nature. 

COLD DESSERTS 

Facts to Remember When Making Cold Desserts 

GELATINES 

Any liquid may be used as the foundation of gelatine desserts. Milk, 
coffee, cocoa, tea, milk partially thickened with eggs or starch, and 
fruit juices and syrups of various kinds offer an almost endless variety 
of combinations. 

Gelatine should always be softened in cold liquid and then dissolved 
in hot liquid or over hot water. 

A gelatine dessert should be just stiff enough when cold to hold its 
shape. If too heavy with gelatine it is rubbery and unappetizing. 

The amount of gelatine depends upon the time that can be allowed 
for cooling, the temperature at which the mixture stands and the 
acidity of the liquid. Without ice, from twelve to twenty-four hours 
is necessary. With ice or in cold weather, gelatine mixtures will 
stiffen in from one to three hours, depending upon the size of the 
mold. Increasing the gelatine decreases the time. A mixture contain- 
ing the juice of a citrus fruit or tomato juice requires a third more 
gelatine than other mixtures. 

Raw pineapple acts upon gelatine in such a way as to prevent it 
from solidifying. The difficulty may be avoided by cooking the pine- 
apple before the gelatine is added. 

A gelatine mixture which has thickened to the consistency of egg 
white behaves much like egg white when it is beaten — its texture and 
color are changed and it becomes what is called a sponge. The texture 
may be further modified by folding in beaten egg whites. If whipped 
cream is added to the sponge it is called Bavarian cream.

116 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

CUSTARDS 

The most important points to remember in cooking custard desserts 
are that the temperature must not be too high and the mixture must 
not cook too long. Baked custards should be set in a pan of water 
in the oven. Soft custard is most successfully made in a double boiler. 
It should be stirred constantly. 

A custard is milk thickened with egg and sweetened and flavored 
in various ways. It is a popular dessert made in many forms. 

Custard may be baked in the oven or cooked over hot water. The 
latter variety is called soft or " boiled " custard. 

The consistency of a custard depends upon the proportion of egg to 
milk. One egg will thicken a cup of milk to make a thin soft custard 
or a custard baked in individual cups. For a thick custard or a custard 
that can be baked in a large mold more egg is necessary. A little 
cornstarch or flour may be substituted for part of the egg. 

BLANC-MANGES 

Blanc-manges are made with a liquid foundation, usually all or 
part milk, thickened with some form of starch. Cornstarch is most 
commonly used. Many variations are possible by the addition of 
different ingredients. 

A blanc-mange requires at least fifteen minutes cooking after it has 
thickened, to make the starch palatable and easy to digest. 

Two tablespoons of cornstarch to a cup of milk is the correct pro- 
portion for a plain blanc-mange that will hold its shape when molded 
and yet be delicate in texture.

FROZEN DESSERTS 

Facts to Remember about Frozen Desserts 

The texture of frozen desserts depends upon the nature of the mix- 
ture and the proportion of ice and salt used in freezing it. 

A mixture which is given body by cream or eggs, or is thickened 
with a starch or gelatine, will be smoother than one containing a large 
proportion of water and nothing to thicken it. 

For smooth, fine-grained ice cream, sherbet, or water ice, three parts 
of ice to one of salt should be used. For frappes, a coarser texture is 
desired and equal parts of ice and salt are used. Mousses and parfaits, 
rich mixtures frozen without stirring, require two parts of ice to one 
of salt. 

The ice should be broken in pieces small enough to prevent the 
formation of large air spaces between, but not so fine that melting will 
take place rapidly. The salt and ice should be thoroughly mixed 
before putting them in the freezer. 

With any mixture that is stirred during the freezing process, the can 
should not be more than three-quarters full, to allow for swelling. 

The crank should be turned slowly at first, and then more rapidly 
in order to beat air into the mixture as it begins to freeze. 

When the mixture is frozen the water which has accumulated in the 
pail should be poured off and the freezer refilled with four parts of ice 
to one of salt. 

Ice creams and sherbets should stand for at least an hour before 
serving. This ripening process improves the flavor and the texture. 



FROZEN DESSERTS 137 

Mousses and parfaits require from two to four hours to freeze, de- 
pending upon the richness of the mixture and the size of the mold. 

To mold ices and creams, pack the frozen mixture solidly into chilled 
molds, and fill the molds completely. Cover with heavy waxed paper, 
put on the covers, and seal the edges with strips of cloth dipped in 
melted lard or other solid fat. Bury the molds in ice and salt. To 
unmold, rinse with cold water and wipe dry, remove the covers, invert 
the molds on a platter, and wrap for a moment with a cloth wrung out 
of hot water. 

APRICOT ICE 

1% cups apricot pulp 3 cups water 

2 cups sugar V2 cup lemon juice 

Use one No. 2 can of apricots and put through coarse sieve.

minutes. Cool syrup, and add with lemon juice to apricot 
pulp. Freeze to a mush, and let stand one hour or more to 
ripen. Servings, 8. 

FROZEN BISQUE

HOT DESSERTS 

Facts to Remember in Preparing Hot Desserts 

Almost any cake served hot with a sauce makes an acceptable 
dessert. 

Steamed pudding may be cooked in molds set in a steamer or placed 
on a trivet in a kettle of boiling water. 

Molds for steamed puddings should be filled not more than two- 
thirds full. It the batter does not have room to rise completely it 
will be heavy. 

In order to have a light pudding the steaming must continue with- 
out interruption; if water must be added to the kettle it should be 
boiling. The cover of the steamer should fit closely. 

A steamed pudding while hot is cut more easily with a string than 
with a knife. 

Steaming in individual molds cuts down the time of cooking and 
makes serving easier. Ordinary custard cups covered with waxed or 
greased paper will answer for the purpose. 

Biscuit dough forms the basis for an endless variety of fruit short- 
cakes, rolls, and dumplings. 

Pudding with an egg and milk foundation, such as bread pudding, 
should be baked at a low temperature like a custard.

EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 

Facts to Remember When Planning Egg and Cheese Dishes 

Both eggs and cheese have an important place in the dietary, be- 
cause they are rich in tissue-building material and contain valuable 
minerals and vitamines. In menu-making it should be remembered 
that eggs and cheese as sources of protein are substitutes for meat. 

Eggs are one of the most easily digested foods that we have. Cheese 
is a very concentrated food, but if used in combination with other 
foods or by itself in moderate quantities, it is not likely to overtax 
the normal digestion. 

Eggs and cheese, like all protein foods, should be cooked at a low 
temperature. If subjected to too much heat, the protein coagulates 
into a tough leathery mass that is neither appetizing nor easily di- 
gested. Over-cooking of egg and cheese mixtures causes the curdling 
which is so objectionable.

FISH 

Facts to Remember about Fish Cookery 

Fish is important in the dietary as a source of protein. The house- 
keeper values it, too, because of the variety it lends to her menus. 

From a dietary point of view there are two classes of fish — lean or 
dry-meated fish like haddock, cod and halibut, and fat fish such as 
mackerel, salmon, shad and blue fish. 

In purchasing fish one of the most important points to consider is its 
freshness. When fresh the flesh is firm and elastic so that it springs 
back when pressed with the finger. The eyes are bright and clear 
and the gills bright red in color. It is not strong in odor. 

Fish is usually cleaned and dressed at the market and need only be 
wiped with a damp cloth to remove any loose scales and clotted blood. 
Sometimes, however, it reaches the kitchen in its natural condition. 

The first step in dressing fish is to remove the scales. This is done 
by scraping with a dull knife, beginning at the tail and working toward 
the head. The entrails are then removed by slitting the underside of 
the fish with a sharp knife from the head nearly to the tail and drawing 
them out with the fingers. The head and tail may be removed or 
left on as preferred. Large fish usually have the head and tail re- 
moved, except sometimes when they are to be baked. Small fish are 
often cooked with the head and tail on. 

To skin a fish remove the fins and a strip of skin the length of the 
back bone. Loosen the skin on one side at the bony part and draw 
it ofi*, separating from the flesh with a knife when necessary. 

To bone a fish run a sharp knife close to the backbone and ribs, 
beginning at the tail. Remove all the flesh from one side in a single 
piece. Small bones that remain may be picked out with the fingers. 

A fillet of fish is a small piece with skin and bone removed. Large 
fish like halibut are cut into slices crosswise and the slices divided 
into smaller pieces. Small fish are boned and cut in pieces of the 
desired size. 

Fish may be boiled, steamed, baked, broiled, fried or sauted. The 
method of cooking to be chosen depends upon the nature of the fish. 

Boiling. — Small cod or haddock and thick slices of larger fish like 
salmon and halibut may be boiled or steamed to good advantage. 
Water in which fish is boiled should be salted and have a little lemon 
juice or vinegar added to it to keep the flesh light in color. Steaming 
has the advantage of retaining all the nutriment and flavor, but it is 
more difficult to cook seasoning into the fish. It is wise to tie fish 
in a piece of cheesecloth for boiling or steaming so that it can be 
handled without breaking.

178 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

Baking. — For baking, whole fish of medium size are most often 
used. A stuffing adds flavor, and a few slices of bacon or salt pork 
spread over the fish while it is cooking supply fat. Small fish and 
slices of large fish are sometimes cooked in a hot oven instead of 
being broiled. 

Broiling. — Small and medium-sized fish like mackerel, bluefish and 
haddock are prepared for broiling by splitting down the back. Slices 
of halibut, sword fish and salmon may also be broiled. The fish should 
be wiped as dry as possible, sprinkled with salt and pepper and placed 
on a well-greased broiler. Whether the skin or flesh side of a whole 
fish should be broiled first is a debatable point. Broiling the flesh 
side first prevents the escape of juices, but if the skin side is done first 
the fish is easier to handle. It is difficult to turn fish during the 
broiling in the ordinary broiling oven. For this reason it is best to 
cook one side thoroughly before turning. 

Frying or Sauteing. Fish of any kind is often fried or sauted, 
although in a dietary sense the lean fish are better adapted to this 
method of preparation. Small fish are fried whole and larger ones 
made into fillets. Fish should be wiped dry, seasoned with salt and 
pepper, rolled in flour or crumbs, beaten eggs, and crumbs again, and 
fried in deep fat until browned. For sauteing, fish is rolled in flour 
or corn meal. Salt pork is a particularly good fat to use. 

There are various kinds of sauces suitable for serving with fish, but 
acid sauces are best used with fish richest in fat, while lean fish pre- 
pared without the addition of fat call for rich sauces. Lemon may be 
used as a garnish for fish, and served with it. 

Many varieties of fish may be purchased in cans, and others are 
preserved by salting or smoking, so that fish is always available, even 
far inland. 

Shell fish are important for their unique and delicate flavors. The 
distinctive dishes of which they are the basis solve many a menu 
problem.

FROSTINGS AND FILLINGS 

Facts to Remember about Frostings and Fillings 

Frostings are of two kinds, cooked and uncooked. 

Most cooked frostings are made by boiling a syrup to the soft ball 
stage and beating it until creamy, or adding it to stiffly beaten egg 
whites. The surest way for success with cooked frostings is to use a 
candy thermometer. 

Uncooked frostings are made with confectioners' or powdered sugar, 
preferably the former, moistened with some liquid to make it of the 
right consistency to spread, and flavored in different ways. The 
addition of butter helps to keep the frosting moist and takes away 
the raw taste. 

Any frosting may be used as a filling. For fillings less sweet than a 
regular frosting, mixtures thickened with cornstarch or flour, or fruits 
cooked to a paste are good. 

Always pour frosting on the center of the cake and as far as pos- 
sible let it spread itself, aiding it, when necessary, with a knife. Either 
frost the sides like the top or take care that no drops run down from 
the top. 

When covering small cakes with boiled frosting place the cake on an 
inverted cup and set the cup over a jar so that it may be twirled 
about easily. Cover the top of the cake with frosting and let it come 
well down over the sides. Hold a small spatula straight against the 
side of the cake and twirl the cup. The sides of the cake will be 
frosted smoothly and the edges attractively ridged. 

If fondant is used for coating small cakes it should be melted and 
the cakes dipped into it. 

When a soft filling is used for a cake the top is attractive if sprinkled 
with powdered sugar instead of being frosted. 

For decorating frosted cakes, candied fruit, angelica, colored citron, 
tiny candies, orange peel, preserved ginger, nuts or colored popcorn 
may be used, or some of the frosting may be forced through a pastry 
tube.

and when dropped on waxed paper, a very delicious cai 
results. Enough frosting for 12 cup cakes.

MEAT 

The preparation of any meat in such a way as to emphasize its good 
points requires not only a knowledge of underlying principles but care 
in applying them as well. It is just as possible to ruin a choice piece 
of meat through careless cooking as to make an inferior cut palatable 
by adopting the proper method. 

Roasting and Broiling. — By roasting and broiling a delicious flavor 
is developed in meats but this method is suitable only for meats that 
are short-fibred, fine-grained and which do not contain tough connec- 
tive tissue. These cuts come from the parts of the animal where the 
muscles are least used. 

The less choice cuts of meats require a more moist atmosphere to 
make them tender. Pot roasting, stewing and braising can be used 
successfully. 

Roasts should first be subjected to intense heat, which will quickly 
sear over the surface and prevent the escape of juices. A little flour 
rubbed over the meat helps to keep in the juices and facilitates brown- 
ing. After the surface is seared the heat should be reduced, otherwise 
the outer portion will become dry and hard before the heat has pene- 
trated to the centre. The larger the roast the lower the temperature 
should be. A roast of pork may be cooked in a moderate oven for 
the entire period because the surface is so much protected by fat. 
Unless a covered roaster is used the meat should be basted frequently 
with the liquid in the pan. 

The principle involved in broiling is the same as in roasting. It is 
used for small pieces of meat instead of large. Intense heat is applied 
to sear the surface and then the cooking is completed at a lower 
temperature. 

The result obtained by broiling may be approximated in a pan. 
The meat is seared on both sides in a very hot pan without fat and 
then cooked more slowly until done. 

Pot-Roasting. — In pot-roasting the meat is seared over quickly in a 
hot kettle and then cooked slowly with a very little water. 

Braising. — Braising is similar to pot-roasting. The meat is cooked 
in the oven in a tightly covered pan with a small amount of water. 
It is best to sear the surface of the meat first. Vegetables are usually 
added for flavor. 

Stewing. — In stewing the meat is simmered in a relatively large 
amount of water. Browning the meat for stews before cooking adds 
color and flavor. 

205 



206 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

Tough meats can be made somewhat more tender by pounding with 
the back oi a knife or some other blunt tool so as to break the fibre, 
by rubbing the surface with an acid or by cooking in slightly acidulated 
water. 

BEEF 

Facts to Remember about Beef 

Good beef is firm and fine-grained in texture. The surface of a 
freshly cut piece should be bright red in color. Even when it has 
been cut for some time it should be a clear red. though darker. The 
fat is firm, with a clear yellowish tinge. 

In purchasing beef the amount of bone and cartilage in proportion 
to the meat should be considered. One cut may be a few cents lower 
in price than another but the amount of waste may make the real cost 
higher. 

It should be remembered that beef comes from a large animal and 
it is not always possible to purchase a small piece advantageously. 

Many of the beef organs can be utilized to good advantage and 
should not be overlooked in menu making. They offer variety and 
are relatively inexpensive. 

ROAST BEEF 

Put meat in a roasting pan, dredge with flour, and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Put into a very hot oven (500°) to sear 
the surface quickly. As soon as the roast is browned re- 
duce the heat to moderate (350°). For rare beef allow fif- 
teen minutes to the pound, counting the time after the meat 
is seared. For a well-done roast allow twenty minutes to 
the pound. If an uncovered roaster is used baste the meat 
frequently with the liquid in the pan. 

To make gravy, remove the meat from the pan and pour off 
the superfluous fat. leaving about two tablespoonfuls for each 
cup of gravy to be made. Add one and one-half to two table- 
spoons flour for each cup. and blend thoroughly. Add the 
desired amount of water gradually, and cook until thickened, 
stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper. For a six 
pound roast make three cups of gravy. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF 

Wipe the meat with a cloth. Heat kettle or large frying- 
pan, put in meat and sear entire surface. Rub with salt 
and pepper. Add a cup of water, cover, and keep just below 



BEEF 207 

boiling point. Do not let kettle get dry, but keep only a 
little water in it. Cook until meat is tender, — about four 
hours. Thicken liquid for gravy by adding flour mixed to a 
paste with cold water. Use one and one-half to two table- 
spoons flour to each cup of liquid.

VEAL 

Facts to Remember 

Veal is the meat from a young calf. It is at its best when the animal 
is from six weeks to three months old. " Bob veal," meat from a calf 
younger than six weeks, is unfit for food. 

Good veal is pink in color and contains a small proportion of white 
fat. Bob veal may be distinguished from the meat of an older animal 
by its lack of color. 

The keeping quality of veal is poor. The meat should be used soon 
after it is dressed. 

Veal should always be thoroughly cooked. Long cooking at a low 
temperature is best to soften the connective tissue and make the meat 
tender and palatable. As with other meats the surface should first be 
seared to prevent the escape of juices. 

Fat should be added during the cooking to supply the deficiency in 
the composition of the meat. Salt pork and butter give the best flavor. 

Veal is bland in flavor and should be served with a well-seasoned 
sauce or cooked with a stuffing. 

The tissues of veal contain a large proportion of gelatine which 
makes the meat excellent for soup stock. White stock for which many 
recipes call is made from veal. 

The edible organs of the calf are more tender and more delicate in 
flavor than those of any other animal.

LAMB AND MUTTON 

Facts to Remember about Lamb 

Lamb is the flesh of sheep under a year old. Above that age it is 
called mutton. Spring lamb is six weeks to three months old. It 
comes into the market in March to July. The best mutton is cut from 
sheep about three years old. Under that age it lacks flavor and is 
likely to be tough. Lamb may be judged by the leg joint. This joint 
is jagged in the young animal but becomes smooth and round in 
inutton. 

Lamb should be of fine, firm fiber, light pink in color. The bones 
are pink or slightly streaked with red. It contains only a small amount 
of fat. 

Mutton is deeper red in color and the bones are white. It contains 
a considerable amount of fat which should be firm, white and flaky. 

A leg of lamb makes the best roast. It is relatively high in price 
but except for the single bone is practically all solid meat. The fore- 
quarter is often used for stews and soup but it also makes a good 
roast. It is most satisfactory for this purpose if boned and rolled. 

Rib chops are cut from the forequarter, loin chops from the hind 
quarter. The edible portion is greater in the latter but the price is 
higher. 

Rib chops in which the bone has been scraped clean nearly to the 
lean meat are called French chops. 

A crown roast of lamb consists of pieces of loin from each side, each 
containing the same number of ribs. They are carefully trimmed and 
fastened together in the form of a circle. 

A saddle of mutton consists of the two sides of the loin cut off 
before the backbone is split. 

LAMB BROCHETTES 

Have lamb from the forequarter cut into inch cubes. String 
these on metal skewers, alternating the lamb with narrower 
pieces of salt pork. Broil and serve as chops on the skewers.

228 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

PORK 

Facts to Remember about Pork 

When pork is in proper condition the skin and fat are white and 
clear, except the kidney or leaf lard which is slightly pinkish in hue. 
The flesh is composed of fine-grained tissues and is pink in color. 

The thicker the skin of pork the older the animal from which it 
was cut. 

Pork contains a larger proportion of fat than any other meat. 
Consequently its food value is higher and special care should be taken 
in selecting other foods to combine with it. 

Pork should always be thoroughly cooked. It is not only distasteful 
but even dangerous to health when underdone. 

Ham that is very salt should be freshened before cooking. A slice 
is freshened by being covered with cold water and brought slowly to 
the simmering point. A whole ham should stand in cold water over 
night 'or at least for several hours. 

ROAST PIG 

Scrape and wash the pig. Rub dry with a fresh cloth and 
dust the inside with salt and pepper. Stuff, and sew up the 
incision. Fasten the feet together. Before putting in the 
roasting pan, place a wedge in the mouth to keep it open to 
receive an apple, orange, or lemon as garnish when served. 
Use a rack of wood or metal in the roasting pan to lift the 
meat out of the dripping juices during the cooking process. 
Put the pig in feet upwards. Baste often unless you use a 
covered roaster. Slash the skin around the neck before 
putting the pig on the platter, so that the moisture may 
evaporate and the skin keep its crispness. Allow about 
twenty minutes per pound and use an oven temperature of 
450° reducing toward the end of the cooking period.

PIE AND PASTRY 

Few desserts are more popular than pies and pastries, few require a 
smaller number of ingredients; but skill in handling is as essential 
here as it is anywhere in the whole range of cookery. It was experi- 
ence, more than anything else, that produced the pies mother used to 
make. 

The chief point to remember in making pastry is to use a light 
touch in all the processes. Work in the shortening with the tips of the 
fingers only, or cut it in with knives. Mix in the water thoroughly, 
but do not work the paste any more than is necessary. Do not knead 
it with the hands. Use the rolling pin lightly. 

Use the smallest possible amount of water. Too much water is one 
of the commonest causes of tough pastry. 

When baking an unfilled crust prick it with a fork so that it will not 
pun up in blisters with the heat of the oven. 

Paltry without filling should be baked in a hot oven (400°^150 o ). 

When the filling of a pie requires a lower temperature than the 
crust, the baking problem is complicated. In this case it is best to 
put the pie into a hot oven to start the cooking of the pastry, and 
then, before the filling has become thoroughly heated, reduce the 
temperature. 

To prevent the under crusts of pies from being soggy, brush them 
with white of egg if filling is to be cooked in them. If the cruets are 
baked separately, cool them before putting in the filling. 

To keep the juice of a berry pie from boiling out, insert a funnel of 
stiff paper through a hole in the upper crust. 

ALMOND PASTRY 

1% cups pastry flour 1 teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons ground al- Vi cup shortening 

monds 1 egg 

3 tablespoons sugar Water 

dry ingredients and rub in shortening. Add beaten egg 
and enough water to hold paste together. Roll and bake in 
a hot oven. Almond pastry may be used for custard pies, 
lemon pies, fresh or dried fruit pies, or for tarts to be filled 
with jelly, marmalade, fruit, or whipped cream mixtures.

248 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 



CHOUX PASTRY 

V2 cup butter Pinch salt 

1 cup boiling water 3 eggs 

1 cup flour 

Put butter and water in a saucepan and bring to the boiling 
point. Add flour and salt, and stir vigorously until the mix- 
ture makes a ball that comes away from the sides of the pan. 
Remove from fire and add unbeaten eggs one at a time, beat- 
ing each one in thoroughly before adding the next. Form in 
the desired shape on a greased baking sheet. For eclairs 
squeeze the batter through a pastry bag. Shape cream purls 
with a spoon, making them as nearly round as possible with 
the batter slightly heaped in the middle. 

The secret of success in making choux pastry really lies 
in the baking process. Two points must be borne in mind, 
a moderate oven and plenty of time. As in any mixture 
where eggs act as the only leavening agent, especial care in 
the matter of temperature is necessary. Too high a tem- 
perature ruins the texture and too low a temperature makes 
them fail to rise. 
Time in oven, 45 minutes. Temperature, 325°. Servings, 10.

out in circular form and place one-third of the dry part 
across the centre of the dough, and fold over from each side 
to make three layers. Turn half way round, roll out, and 
repeat twice, until all of the dry mixture is used.

POULTRY 

Facts to Remember about Poultry 

Fresh poultry should be firm, of yellowish tinge, with a fair amount 
of fat under the skin. A flabby, bluish look denotes cold storage 
poultry. 

A chicken has smooth soft feet, and smooth tender skin with pin 
feathers but few hairs. The end of the breast bone is flexible and 
the flesh is lean. 

In fowls, the feet are hard and scaly, and the skin thick and tough 
with long hairs instead of pin feathers. The cartilage at the end of 
the breast bone has hardened so that it is no longer flexible. A fowl 
has a larger proportion of fat than a chicken. 

In preparing a chicken for cooking the first step is to singe it to 
remove the hairs. Do this by holding it by the neck and feet and 
revolving it over a gas flame or a blazing paper. Take care not to 
scorch the skin. Pin feathers are removed with a small knife or 
tweezers. The oil sac above the tail should be cut out. 

If the chicken has not been dressed at the market the next step is 
to draw it. First cut a slit lengthwise in the skin of the neck at the 
front, insert the fingers and draw out the crop, which lies just under 
the skin close to the breast, and with it the windpipe. Next make an 
incision just below the breast bone large enough to admit the hand. 
Work around the organs, loosening them from the body. Slip the 
fingers around the whole mass near the neck and pull it gently out. 
The crop and wind pipe may be removed in this way instead of through 
the neck. Be careful to remove the bits of lung and liver that cling 
between the ribs. Rinse the cavity with cold water. 

If the tendons in the legs are removed the meat will be more tender. 
Cut a slit just above the foot and the tendons will be visible. Pull 
them downwards with a steady motion until they loosen at the second 
joint and come out. 

To cut up a chicken, first cut through the skin between the body and 
leg, close to the body. Bend back the leg to break the ligaments, cut 
through the flesh and separate at the joint. Divide the leg into two 
sections by cutting through the flesh and separating at the joint. Cut 
through the skin and flesh around the upper wing joint and disjoint 
the wing from the body. Cut off the tip of the wing. In the same 

264 



POULTRY 265 

way remove the leg and wing from the other side. Separate the breast 
from the back by cutting through the skin two inches below the breast 
bone and running the knife along the line of the lower ribs until it 
strikes the back bone. Then break the bone at the joint and pull the 
two pieces apart. Loosen the skin around the neck with the finger, 
break the neck back and remove it. 

In stuffing a chicken, fill the crop region with the dressing and tie 
the end of the skin over the neck. Then fill the body region and sew 
up the opening, or fasten it by sticking toothpicks through the skin 
on either side and lacing twine around the ends. Allowance should be 
made for the swelling of the dressing as it cooks. Truss the wings and 
legs close to the body by tying with twine or fastening with two long 
skewers run through the body of the bird, one just beneath the legs, 
the other through the wings and breast. Tie the ends of the legs 
together and fasten down to the tail. 

Turkey, duck and goose are prepared similarly to chicken. They are 
usually cooked by roasting. 

Roasting. — In roasting poultry the larger the bird the lower should 
be the temperature. The skin protects against loss of juices so that it 
is not necessary to sear the surface with intense heat as it is in the 
case of meats. The temperature should be sufficiently high, however, 
to brown the skin during the first part of the cooking. 

Keep a little water in the pan while the bird is roasting. Baste 
frequently unless a self-basting roaster is used. 

Most poultry is improved by the addition of fat, preferably butter 
or salt pork. 

Frying. — For frying, young chickens are used. Clean them and cut 
in convenient pieces for serving. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
dredge with flour. Brown on both sides in salt pork fat, bacon fat or 
butter. Then cover and cook slowly until the meat is tender. Older 
chickens may be used for frying if they are first parboiled.

SALADS 

Facts to Remember in Preparing Salads 

The important mineral salts and vitamines and the refreshing acids 
of fruit and vegetables which the body needs daily can be supplied in 
no better way than in the appetizing and attractive form of salads. 

Salads may be broadly classed in two groups — salads which are 
accompaniments to the meat course or form a course in a heavy meal, 
and those which serve as the main part of a meal. 

Salads offer many interesting possibilities for the utilization of left- 
overs. Several ingredients may be combined successfully, but care 
should be taken that the flavors and textures are of a sort that blend 
well. A mixture of too many different materials should be avoided. 

A garnish of some succulent green plant like lettuce, watercress, 
romaine or endive is essential to almost every salad to make it at- 
tractive to the eye, as well as complete in food value. 

The real secret of success with salads is in the careful preparation 
of materials. Lettuce or other greens should be picked over carefully 
and washed in cold water. A single faded leaf, insect ravage or speck 
of dirt will spoil the appearance of the whole salad. If the vegetables 
are at all wilted they should be left in cold water to become crisp, then 
patted dry with a food cloth or twirled in a cheesecloth bag until the 
drops of water have been forced out. Lettuce which is not to be used 
immediately should be left near the ice. 

Vegetables, fruit or meat should be cut into uniform pieces which 
are neither so large that they must be broken before they are eaten 
nor so small that they form a paste when the dressing is added. 

The ingredients and the garnish should be kept cold and dry until it 
is time to mix the salad. Salads should be mixed lightly, never pressed 
down or stirred. 

A salad containing fruit or fresh vegetables should never be mixed 
until just before serving or it will be wilted and the dressing watery. 

When salad ingredients are marinated in vinegar or French dressing 
for additional flavor they should not be allowed to stand too long and 
the superfluous liquid should be carefully drained off before the 
dressing is added. 

In general only simple leaf salads with plain dressing should be 
served with hot meats. The more fatty the meat, the more acid should 
be the salad. Sweet salads or heavy salads made of meat or fish 
should never be served as an accompaniment, but as a separate course. 

275 



276 MODERN PRISCILLA COOK BOOK 

A salad covered with mayonnaise is out of place when a heavy meat 
or rich dish is previously served. 

Plain thin bread and butter sandwiches or simple crackers may be 
served with any salad. Cheese, especially cream cheese, is a tasty 
accompaniment to light salads.

SALAD DRESSINGS 

Facts to Remember about Salad Dressings 

There are three types of salad dressing in common use — French, 
mayonnaise and boiled. Most of the others are simply variants of 
these foundations. 

French dressing is simply a mixture of oil, acid and seasonings 
thoroughly blended by beating. 

Mayonnaise is another uncooked dressing. It contains the same 
ingredients as French dressing and, in addition, egg to give it body. 
Mayonnaise is a rich dressing and should be used sparingly. 

Difficulty frequently arises in making mayonnaise, because the in- 
gredients tend to separate instead of blending into a smooth thick 
dressing. If this curdling does occur, there are various ways of 
remedying the condition. The simplest is to take a very little cold 
water (not more than half a teaspoonful) and add to it the mixture 
drop by drop, beating vigorously. A fork is effective for beating when 
working with a small quantity like this. A small amount of egg white 
may be used in the same way in place of the water, or the dressing 
may be made over by starting with another egg yolk and adding the 
original mixture to it very gradually. 

The so-called boiled dressings are not actually boiled, but cooked 
below the boiling point like a soft custard. They consist of a liquid, 
usually milk, thickened with egg or starch or a combination of both 
and seasoned highly. The secret of making a cooked dressing without 
having it curdle lies in having the acid and the foundation mixture 
both hot or both cold when they are mixed. Like a custard, a boiled 
dressing made with egg must not be cooked too long nor at too high 
a temperature. Vigorous beating will sometimes make a curdled boiled 
dressing smooth again. 

For delicate salads, lemon juice is often preferred in place of vinegar 
in the dressing. To mayonnaise or boiled dressing an equal quantity 
of whipped cream may be added.

SANDWICHES 

The variety that is possible in sandwiches is almost unlimited, but 
in general they may be divided into three classes — lunch box or 
picnic sandwiches, whole-meal sandwiches and afternoon tea sand- 
wiches. 

Sandwiches usually form an important part of the lunch box or 
picnic meal. Fillings should be selected which give adequate food 
value and sufficient variety to appeal to the appetite. The keeping 
quality is also a consideration. Vegetables that wilt quickly, and semi- 
liquid mixtures that soak into the bread should be avoided. 

A whole-meal sandwich should be sufficiently hearty to make a 
whole course at luncheon or supper. Salad sandwiches, meat sandwiches 
served with hot gravy, and club sandwiches fall into this class. Sand- 
wiches made from toast instead of plain bread are often used. 

For the afternoon tea sandwich, slices of bread with the crust re- 
moved and of wafer-like thinness are essential. Fancy cutters have 
their place here. The open sandwich, a single slice of bread spread 
with filling and attractively garnished, may be used for variety. 

The canape is really an open sandwich served as the first course at 
dinner. Highly seasoned fillings are used and the bread is usually 
sauted in butter or toasted. 

Yeast bread for sandwich making should be at least twenty-four 
hours old. Quick bread may be used when it is less than twenty-four 
hours old if it is quite cold and is firm in texture. 

The bread should always be cut in even slices never more than a 
quarter of an inch thick. If the loaves are of uniform shape, and if 
the crust is not hard nor too dark in color, it is not necessary to 
remove the crusts from sandwiches except for special occasions. 

The butter should be creamed until very soft, but it never should be 
melted. The slices of bread should be buttered in the order in which 
they are cut and kept in pairs so that they will fit together evenly. 
They should be buttered to the very edges. 

Filling should be used generously and spread evenly. The ingredients 
should be chopped fine enough to make a smooth filling. Fillings 
should be spread to cover the bread completely. Sliced meats and 
vegetables should be trimmed to correspond to the shape of the 
sandwich. 

Sandwiches which are to be kept any length of time should be 
wrapped in a cloth wrung very dry from cold water. For the lunch 
box, sandwiches should be wrapped in waxed paper. It is best to 
keep sandwiches with different fillings separate from one another.

SOUPS 

Facts to Remember about Soups 

Whether soup is used in the menu as an appetizer or for its food 
value depends upon its nature. Clear soups like bouillon, consomme 
and plain meat broth have very little fuel value in themselves but 
they start the flow of gastric juices and help to create an appetite. 
Thick cream soups and purees are sufficiently nourishing to make up 
a substantial part of the meal. 

Soup affords the housekeeper an excellent opportunity for utilizing 
left-overs. 

Careful preparation and service is particularly important with soup. 
Lukewarm, greasy or poorly seasoned soup is one of the most un- 
appetizing dishes that can be served. 

Any highly seasoned, clear stock may be made into a jellied soup 
that appeals particularly to the appetite on a hot day. Use a little 
less than a tablespoon of gelatine, softened in cold water, to each pint 
of liquid. Jellied soup should be a little less solid than a gelatine 
dessert. 

Fruit soups are less known to Americans, and to the conservative 
palate, unaccustomed to them, probably make small appeal. As a 
variety in the menu they recommend themselves for trial to the 
discriminating cook.

VEGETABLES 

Facts to Remember about Vegetable Cookery 

Vegetables provide some fuel in the shape of sugar and starch 
and have in addition valuable mineral content, necessary vitamines, 
and enough indigestible residue to provide roughage. 

All vegetables should be carefully washed before cooking. A small 
brush is convenient for cleaning the root vegetables. 

Vegetables that grow in the form of heads, like cabbage, cauliflower 
and Brussels sprouts, should be allowed to stand half an hour in salt 
water to draw out any insects that may be lodged in them. 

Wilted vegetables may be made fresh and crisp by placing them for 
a short time in cold water. 

Much of the mineral matter in vegetables lies near the skin. For 
this reason, as thin a paring as possible should be removed. It is often 
practical to cook vegetables in their skins. 

Any vegetable may be cooked by boiling. By this method some of 
the flavor and nutritive material is drawn out and dissolved in the 
water. To preserve it, a small quantity of water should be used so 
that it can be served with the vegetable, or the* water should be 
utilized in soups or sauces. In the case of a strong flavored vegetable, 
a large amount of water may be used because a more delicate flavor 
is desirable. 

Steaming is also suitable for all vegetables and insures against loss 
of flavor and nutritive value. 

Many vegetables, particularly the starchy ones, develop delicious 
flavor by baking. By this method, too, the nutritive value is retained. 

Some vegetables such as egg-plant, summer squash and parsnips are 
cooked successfully by frying or sauteing. This method adds fat 
and improves flavor. 

Salt tends to harden the fiber and to draw out the flavor. It is 
therefore best to add salt to vegetables near the end of the cooking 
period. 

Any record of cooking time is only a general guide. The time varies 
according to the age and quality of the vegetable. 

Over-cooking often develops unpleasant flavors in vegetables and 
gives them an unattractive color.

wire rack or soft brown paper ready for draining. The salt 
shaker and a hot serving dish should be at hand. The fat 
should be hot enough to register 360-370 degrees on a ther- 
mometer or to brown a cube of bread in forty seconds. Put 
only a few potatoes in the basket at one time. The cold 
potatoes will lower the temperature of the fat to about 340 
degrees, which will cook them through without browning too 
much, in about four minutes for each basket-load. Drain 
potatoes on wire rack and while still very hot sprinkle with 
salt. Reheat and test fat each time before adding a new; lot 
of potatoes.
