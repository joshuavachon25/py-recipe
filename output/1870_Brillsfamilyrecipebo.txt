PREFACE, 



In issuing this, our first number of Brill's Receipt 
Book, we aim to make it brief, comprehensive and prac- 
tical. A general, rather than a scientific arrangement has 
been adopted, as the object of the work is popular and 
universal, and though useful to men of science, it is more 
especially addressed to practical persons, heads of fami- 
lies, and the public at large. There are few persons who 
will not find on looking over its pages, some article that 
will interest them, and be of some use and advantage to 
them. The sources from which the materials of the work 
have been gathered, render it deserving of the utmost 
confidence; a large portion having been derived from 
personal experience. The publisher therefore presents to 
the mistresses and managers of domestic economy, the 
various classes of experimental artisans and men of busi- 
ness, both operative and traders, a volume which will be 
universally admitted to be superior to every preceding 
collection of receipts for general utility. 



NOTICE. 

The first issue of our book being incomplete, the recipes only 
taking up half of the alphabet. All those desiriiig the balance 
of the work can get a copy gi'atuitously from any of the adver- 
tisers in the book, in the course of a few tnonths, when we expect 
to issue the second edition.

TREATMENTS FOR POISONS. 



Poisoning invariably demands prompt treatment, and every 
family shotikl be prepared >yith the proper remedies, v^liich slioiild 
be used according to the directions lierein given, until your Physi- 
cian arrives, who must be at once summoned, as to know the proper 
mode of procedure, in such cases is of the utmost importance. When 
it is ascertained that a poison has been swallowed, emetics must at 
once be given, unless vomiting has taken place spontaneously. 
Articles generally kept in the house, sucli as Ground Mustard, 
Alum, Salt, Sulphate Zinc, &c., may be given; a large tea-spoonful 
of Mustard in a tumbler of warm water, wluch should be followed 
with a like amount of Salt. Should the first not prove successful. 
Powdered Alum, in doses of half-ounce with Syrup, Sulphate of 
Zinc, in doses of ten grains; the above quantities can be repeated 
every ten minutes, until at least three doses have been given. 
Vomiting can frequently be induced by tickling the throat with the 
finger, or the feather end of a quill. 

When vomiting has taken place, the stomach must be protected 

by freely administering demulcent, mucilaginous or oleaginous 

drinks, such as White of Eggs, Linseed or Olive Oil, melted Butter 

or Lard, Flaxseed, Slippery Elm, Gum Arabic or Barley Water, 

f> Milk, Starch, Wheat Flour, or Arrow Root mixed with Water, &c. o

.ADIES DESIRE WHAT MEN ADMIRE. \ 

THIS LITTLE TIIIJfG IS BEAUTY. 

What do we say is beautiful? A transparent complexion and a 
luxuriant head of hair. What will produce these ? Morrison's 
Genuine Pine Tar Soap. It is impregnated with exotics 
of the mildest and most balsamic nature, and is warranted perfectly 
innocent and free from mineral and all other pernicious admixtures, 
and is selected by the Ladies and public in general in preference to 
any other Toilet Soap. For the softness and delicacy which it 
induces to the hand and face, its capability of soothing irritation 
and removing unsightly eruptions, rendering it indispensable to 
every toilet table, this Soap has no equal. It preserves the com- 
plexion fair, the skin soft, flexible and liealthy ; it removes all dan- 
druff; preserves the hair soft and silky, ami prevents it from falling 
off. It cures Scald Head, Sunburn, Pimples on the Face, Salt 
Rheum, fresh Cuts or Wounds of all kinds. Ring Worm, Tetter, Itch, 
Cracked or Chaped hands. A solution in warm water will destroy 
fungus, or proud flesh, and rapidly heal old sores and indolent ul- 
cers. For the Itch, sponge the whole system with the soap two or 
three nights on going to bed, and let it dry in. After that wash 
with the soap and water. 

This Soap, by its cleansing, healing and tonic properties, will 
soon restore the pores of the skin to their natural health3' condition. 
For this purpose, it should be used in a bath, or applied with a 
sponge and water; after which rub briskly with a towel. Scrofu- 
lous and consumptive persons will add years of pleasure to their 
lives by using this Soap freely in their baths, twice a week. 

Its singular but not unpleasant odor is the result of the peculiar 
combination of PURE PINE TAR, with other ingredients 
used by the ancients, and celebrated among the medical faculty for 
thoir healing and tonic properties. 

EvERYBOBY kuows that Pine Tar is one of the most healing and 
soothing remedies. Our best Physicians recommend all mothers to 
use this Soap on their children in preference to any other. All 
lespectable dealers keep it, or will get it for you, if you call for it. 
Be sure you get 

MORRISON'S GENUINE PINE TAR SOAR 

And take no other. All others are imitations. One agent wanted 
in every town. .Special inducements offered.

CELEBRATED PAPER COLLARS, 






Who is compelled during the heated term to 
drink large quantities of water, in order to sup- 
ply the fast evaporating fluids of the body, is 
often seized by sudden Cramp which may 
end in death if immediate relief is not given. By 
keeping a bottle of 

Pain Eradieator 

Constantly at hand, the risk is comparatively 
small as a teaspoonful taken in water or brandy, 
will immediately relieve the most violent attack. 
A piece of flannel moistered wdth the medicine, 
and laid over the Stomach is also a sovereign 
remedy. Your Druggist has it for sale ; if not, 
write to us and we will send you a bottle by 
Express. 



For large size. Charges prepaid.

Crullers. 

Half a pound of Butter, three-quarterg of a pound of Sugar, 
two pounds of Flour, one Nutmeg grated, half a teaspoonful of 
Soda dissolved in lialf a teacup of v/ater or milk, six Eggs. 

Chocolate Caromel. 

One Cup of Chocolate, one cup of Molasses, half a cup of Milk, 
one cup of Sugar; boil twenty minutes, and when nearly done, add 
a piece of Butter the size of an Egg. 

Chocolate Caromel. 

Half a pound of Chocolate, three pounds of dark brown Sugar, 
one-eighth pound of Butter, a small teacup of Milk, season with 
Vanilla or grated Lemon or Orange Peel ; boil it very quickly over 
a hot fire, stirring constantly ; when it becomes hard on being 
dropped in water, take it off the fire and stir for a few moments 
before pouring into buttered dishes; before it is quite cool cut into 
little squares ; those who like the caromel very hard, need not stir 
it, as this makes it sugary ; the grated peel should not be put in 
until the caromel is taken from the fire. 

Cocoanut Cake. 

One cup of Sugar, half cup of Butter, two-thirds of a cup of 
Flour, whites of eight Eggs, one Cocoanut grated, two teaspoonfuls

Brill's Worm Confections come before the public not as some- 
thing new, but as an improvement on what has already been intro* 
duced. 

Living in an age of improvement we ought to encourage every- 
thing that leads to advancement in medicifie, as well as any other 
science. The Lozenges are composed entirely of vegetable ingredi- 
ents that are used by the most prominent practitioners in the coun- 
try, by combining these with pure white sugar, and moulding them 
into proper shape, they make an agreeable, harmless and yet 

VERT EFFECTIVE VERMIFUGE. 

Brill's Worm Confections will undoubtedly supercede all the old 
nauseous vermifuges that have been a terror to children for years, 
and they will hail with delight a medicine so pleasant to take. In 
fact, they need not know that it is medicine as it i* almost impossi- 
ble to distinguish them from the best Bon Bons. Ask for Brill's 
and give them a trial.

to tlie public it was subjected to the most rigid tests, that its efficacy 
in curing certain aft'ections might be determined, and in every in-

who have been cured, the inventor wa.s induced to send it forth

Cider free from sediment; shake together and you have a Cider that 
will keep for any length of time. 

Cider Wine. 

Tnl<e CJood Cider made from Foimd, ripe Apples, (sour ones 
preferred), let it ferment from one to three weeks, as tlie weatlier 
is warm or cool; wlien it has attained a lively fermentation, add 
to each gallon according to its Acidity, from half to two pounds of 
White Sugar, then let the whole ferment, until it possesses precisely 
the taste which it is desired should be permanent. In thi^t condi- 
tion pour out a fjiiart of tlie Cider, and add for each gallon of Cider 
J o7,. of Sulphite of Lime, mixing the Powder thoroughly with the 
quart of Cider, then retiirn the wlu>le to the barrel, agitate briskly 
for a few moments and let settle, the fermentation will cease at once. 
Wlien it ]ja.s become clear draw off carefully and bottle, cork loosely 
so as to prevent the bottles bursting, should it again begin to fer- 
ment. This Cider will keep a long time, and be equal in taste to 
Wine. 

Cider, To Preserve. 

Add ten ounces of Sulphite of Lime to every barrel of Cider 
mixing the Lime first with a little Cider, shake together well, or 
take one pound of White Mustard »Secd, jmt it into a bag and hang 
it into the bunghole of the barrel ; it gives the Cider a pleasant 
spicy taste and arrests fermentation. 

Cider, Artificial, 

To twenty gallons of Wafer add fifteen pounds of White or 
Brown Sugar, one-half pound of Tartaric Acid ; then boil two pounds 
of Dried Apples and add the juice, put into a keg or barrel; makes 
a good Cider and answers well for a summer drink or for Fever 
Patients.

PAIN ERADICATOR 

AS A CUKE FOR 




In regard to the efBcacy of the Pain Eradicatok we refer to 
the following Certificates from well known and reliable persons ; — 

New York, Nov. 22d, 1869. 

Mr. W. H. BrilIj. — Dear Sir: — Over a year ago you will proba- 
bly remember presenting me with a bottle of your Pain Eradicator, 
wliich I had no use for, and in consequence presented it to a lady 
friend of mine in Philadelphia, who sufl'ered fearfully from ner- 
vous headache, and at times was perfectly prostrate ; she had no 
other remedy by her but your medicine, and took a dose, which 
acted as a perfect charm ; and for several times feeling it coming 
on, took a dose which quite prevented it ; on giving it to two other 
friends affected in a similar way, it had precisely the same happy 
effect. I am glad to inform you of its good effect, and any refer- 
ence or certificate that will be of service to you I shall be glad to 
endorse, and would thank you to send a large bottle to Mrs. G. B. 

C , Chestnut St., Philadelphia, as soon as possible, and bill to 

me. By so doing you will greatly oblige 

Yours, truly, H. S. PILKINGTON, 

Drug Broker, Cedar St., N. T. 



Allegheny, Feb. 14, 1870. 
W. H. Brill, Esq. — Sir: — I am prepared in confidence to speak 
of your Pain Eradicator in the most flattering terms, as a cure for 
Neuralgia in any form, and especially for nervous headache, from 
which I have been a sufferer for years. Accidentally happening 
into your store I was induced to try it for an attack that had given 
me great pain for several days. In less than ten minutes after ap- 
plying the remedy and taking a teaspoonful internally, I was, to 
my surprise, entirely relieved. I cheerfully advise all of my 
friends, and the general public, to try one bottle and they will find 
my assertions correct. j. WHITE, No. 6 Shield St. 

Gon. ARent for Tuttle's EUiptio Heat Valve. 

Pittsburgh, Feb. 10, 1869. 
Messrs. W. H. Brill & Co. — Gentlemen: — I have been using 
your valuable Pain Eradicator in my family for some time, and can 
recommend it highly to persons afflicted Avith Neuralgia, as I have 
had immediate relief after several applications, when suffering the 
most excruciating pain in the head, from frequent attacks of the 
malady. I also cheerfully bear testimony to its efficacy in speedily 
relieving nervous headache, having frequently seen its curative 
^ effects on one of my own family, j) g DIFFENBACHER,

DROWNING. 
Resuscitation of the Drowned. 

Insufflation of the lungs must take place, which can be done 
by introducing a tube of any kind, even a tobacco-pipe well washed, 
into a nostril, and both nostrils being pressed against the tube; the 
mouth should be stopped by the operator's hand, and he should 
then blow with sufficient force Into the tube to drive air into the 
lungs ; the chest is then seen to rise. By removing the tube and 
the hand from the mouth expiration will spontaneously take place, 
and it may be aided by the open hand applied with moderate pres- 
sure to the lower part of the chest. This manoeuvre being repeated 
ten or twelve times the heart is felt to beat, if the patient had at 
the beginning of the operation any vitality in him. 

Dropsy, Cure for. 

Take the inner bark of the Common Elder, a sufficient quan- 
tity put into a bottle and add Hard Cider sufficient to make a strong 
infusion. The dose for an adult should be one ounce three or four 
times a day, improvement will at once be perceptible ; should the 
patient be feeble give with the above, Tinture of Iron and Sulphate 
of Quinine.

Enamels. 



Usually formed of Glass, colored with Metallic Oxides, and 
applied in a thin stratum to brightly polished metallic surfaces, on 
which they can be fused by the flame of a lamp urged by the blow- 
pipe or by the heat of .a furnace, and in cooling, forms a vitreous 
varnish of any shade or color desired. The preparation of Enamels 
being entirely dependent on chemistry, — " any person wishing it can 
get recipes for any shade by applying to the author of this work." 

Files, To Clean or Re-cut. 

This method was invented by Prof. Piatt after great expense 
and trouble, and is the more valuable. 

Dissolve four ounces of Saleratus in a quart of Water, and boil 
the files in it for half an hour, then wasli and dry them ; now have 
ready in a stout vessel one quart of Rain Water, to which you have 
added four ounces of Sulphuric Acid, immerse the files in tliis 
preparation and let them remain from six to twelve hours, accord- 
ing to the fineness or coarseness of the files, then remove, wash 
clean and dry quickly, and put a little Sweet Oil on them to cover 
the surface. Files may be re-cut in this manner at least three times, 
making in all more wear than it took to wear out the file at first. 
The preparation can be used as long as you can see action taking 
place on putting the files in ; keep well covered when not in use. 

Frosted Feet. 

Soak them in Cold Water before going to bed, and bathe the 
parts aflfected freely with Pain Eradicator and it will reduce the 
swelling, take out the soreness, and your feet will get well.

SYMPTOMS AJ^B TREATMEJfT. 



Worms afflict the human race of all ages, from earliest childhood 
to advanced life, though more frequently the young, they as a rule 
depend on a morbid condition of the Digestive Organs, caused by 
unwholesome food, inpure air, or depraved constitution. 

The general symptoms are enlarged and swollen abdomen, itching 
at the anus and nose, headache, foul breath, gnawing pain in the 
stomach, impaired and irregular aj)petite, sometimes ravenous, and 
again little or none, bowels often loose or constipated, peevishness, 
disturbed sleep, grinding of the teeth, &c. No set of symptoms 
can positively be depended on, but the above are most reliable. 
Worms are often the bane of a child's existence and prolific source 
of the numerous diseases which imperil the lives of Children ; their 
presence in the intestinal canal is the source of great irritation, 
which operating on the delicate nervous organization of the child, 
so keenly alive to every morbid impression, gives rise oftentimes 
to the most violent disturbances of the nervous system, such as 
Fits, Convulsions, Epilepsy, Saint Vitus Dance, &c. 

Mothers should watch with great care the earliest symptoms 
indicating the presence of worms, and by the use of 

iiiii til iiimttii. 

dislodge them before the health of the child is seriously impaired 
or its life endangered. Brill's Confections being perfectly harm- 
less, mothers should use them at once where there is the least 
suspicion of worms. This valuable remedy is purely vegetable and 
can do no harm. Inquire of your Druggist or Grocer for BEILL'S 
& WORM CONFECTIONS, and do not let them impose on you with Z 
(^ J' worthless substitutes. v^ %p

Eggs, How to Preserve Them. 

For every three gallons of Water put in one pint of Fresh 
Slacked Lime, and the same amount of Common Salt. Mix well 
and put into a barrel which should be half full of this fluid, then 
put in your Eggs carefully so as not to break any, then cover the 
vessel over with a lid, on which also put Lime and Salt ; this pro- 
cess wiU keep Eggs from two to four years if properly managed. 

Another Method. 

Dissolve some Gum Shellac in Alcohol so as to make a thin 
varnish ; give each Egg a coat, after they are perfectly dry, pack in 
on Bran or Sawdust with their points downward, in such a manner 
that they cannot shift about should it be necessary. For Hatching 
wash the varnish ofl' with a little Alcohol. 

Egg Flip. 

Beer or Ale one pint, three Eggs, Sugar two ounces, Nutmeg 
and Ginger sufficient; break the Eggs into one-half of the Beer, 
add the Sugar and beat well together, then place into a warmer and 
heat to nearly boiling, stirring all the time. Next add the other 
portion of the Beer and Spices and mix well ; some prefer a glass 
of Spirits instead of Beer. Care must be taken not to let it boil, if 
it should, the Eggs will separate. 

Fainting, Treatment for. 

Free exposure to the air, baring neck and chest, cold douche, 
stimulants applied with friction, irritating agents to the nostrils, as 
Veratria, dilute Ammonia, etc. 

In order to clear the throat, place the person gently on the face 
with one wrist under the forehead, that all fluid and the tongue it- 
self may fall forward and leave the entrance into the, windpipe free, 
imitate respiration by turning the body completely on the side, and 
a little beyond, then again on the face, and so on, alternately fifteen 
times in a minute no more. 

Avoid immediate removal of the patient as it involves a dan- 
gerous loss of time, also the bellows, or any forcing instrument and 
all rough treatment ; the limbs may be rubbed upward with firm 
pressure and with energy, in order to return venous blood to the 
heart.

Falling, and severely bruising any part of the body, often 
causes great trouble, soreness and swelling. If the parts are freely 
bathed with Pain Eradicator two or three times during tlie day 
and before going to bed, the swelling and soreness will subside, and 
little inconvenience will be experienced. 

Furniture, to Polish. 

Take two ounces of Tripoli, powdered, add enough Water to 
cover it, take a piece of white flannel, lay it over a piece of cork 
or rubber and proceed to polish the varnish, always wetting it with 
the Tripoli and Water; when you have a fair even gloss, (which 
will be known by wiping a part with a wet sponge), then take a 
bit of Mutton Suet and Fine Flour and clean the work. 

Fruit, General Directions for Preserving it. 

The first thing to be done in successful conservation, is the 
selection of the fruit, it must be ripe, but not mellow or stale, of 
good size and fair surface. The next tiling is the sugar, which 
should be the best white lump sugar obtainable, perfectly dry and 
destitute of foreign odors; frequently a musty smell may be de- 
tected in sugar, or sometimes the smell of carbon oil, &c., by 
being placed in the vicinity of where articles of a strong odor 
have been kept. The fruit and sugar being selected, the nature 
of the fruit should be well considered, it looks well when put up 
whole, but if in order to do so, they require boiling until the pec- 
tine is changed to jelly, and the fruit is so cooked as to drive off 
the delicate flavors, you have paid dearly for the privilege of 
having your fruit whole. 

Apples should be quartered, unless very small. Pears should 
be halved, the little seckels may be put up whole. Peaches may 
be put up whole or halved, with the pits removed, the last is much 
better, as the prussic acid in the pits gives otherwise too strong a 
flavor to the fruit. All fruits having thick dense rinds should 
have the rind removed or punctured. Puncturing may be done by 
setting a number of fine needles in a piece of pine wood, which 
serves as a handle ; the use of an ordinary fork is barbarous. The 
8 fruit should be peeled or punctured the shortest time possible before $

WHAT PHYHICIiiHa SAY -^^ 



It Btandg to reason that no professional man would allow his 
name to be used in connection v/ith a medicine, unless he is per- 
fectly satisfied with its curative properties, and perfect safety ; nor 
would any one dare to publish a certificate, which was not genuine 
or ^^ Bona fide," in a community where the gentlemen are so well 
known. The public can re?t assured that our recommendations are 
not gotten up as an advertising medium, but to convince the 
skeptic tliat the Pain Eradicator has given entire satisfaction 
wherever it has been introduced, and that the profession of medi- 
cine sanctions its use. ^ 

Greenville, Pa., August Sth, 1868. ^ 
Having my attention drawn to the medical virtues of Brill's 
Pain Eradicator, which is now eliciting so much praise from pro- 
fessional men, and persons who have used it, that I concluded to 
give it a trial in my practice, being opposed to so-called proprietary 
medicines, and feeling skeptical as to its effects, I watched the 
result of the first application witli considerable doubt, but was 
agreeably sur^irised when I saw the immediate relief which it 
afforded the patient, who liad been suffering from a severe attack 
of Neuralgia. Soon after I had occasion to use it in cases of Cramp, 
Colic, Diarrhoea, Ac, with t!ie same good result. I now use it for the 
various diseases wliich the preparation claims to cui'e, and cheer- 
fully recommend it to the profession and jmblic as a reliable 
remedy. KespectfuUy, B. E. BREINER, M. D. 



Messrs. W. H. Brill & Co.— Gentlemen. •—'^etmit me to bear 
testimony to the efficacy of Brill's Pain Eradicator in removing all 
forms of the Neuroses or Neuralgic affections, it has been mv duty 
to prescribe it in. Pain Eradicator will soon be a Iiousehold word 
having more certain effect than any other remedy extant. Its 
soothing and anodyne properties seem to excel! all that is claimed 
for it. I can recommend it to tb.e profession and the suffering pub- 
lic as a speedy restorer to health.

it is put into the sugar, otherwise it will become discolored, there- 
fore the sugar sliould be first prepared ; if, however, fruit when 
peeled is kept under cold water its color will not change. 

If hermetically sealed jars are used, only enough sugar is 
needed to make the fruit palatable ; this should be put into a brass 
kettle with a little water, and allowed to melt slowly. And then 
the heat should be raised gradually to nearly the boiling point. 
The fruit properly prepared is next put into the jars, from which 
it should not again emerge until wanted for the table. The 
amount of sugar proportioned to the fruit by weight, established 
by previous experiments, should then, after being cooled, be divided 
as equally as possible between the jars, and the remaining space 
nearly filled with pure water. The jars should then be placed in 
a kettle containing cold water, pebbles being used to prevent con- 
tact with the bottom and consequent cracking of the jars, and the 
whole raised as quickly as possible to the boiling point and kept 
there about ten minutes. Too long boiling alters the taste and 
color of the fruit. It shouTli be borne in mind that all the heating 
is intended to do, is to expel the air, not cook the fruit. Whatever 
space is left in the jars should now be filled up with hot water, and 
they should be immediately sealed, now place in a dry, cool, and 
dark place. All these requisites must be observed if you desire 
perfection, the action of light discolors the fruit. Heat promotes 
fermentation ; dampness, strange as it may appear, also favors a 
sort of sub-fermentation which generally deteriorates quality. Fruit 
put up strictly according to the above directions will keep for 
years, and retain its original taste and flavor.

Is wanted in every household, something that can be depended on

attack of Cholera Morbus, or even Cholera, Dysentery, Diarrlioea, 
Cramp, Colic, &c., the doctor may be a good Vf-ays otl", and the

immediate benefit. In all the above named cases the directions 
are full and explicit on every bottle, so tliat any one can see how to 
use it. liead the subjoined recommendations: — 

NcRTn Sewickley, September 9, 1869. 
Messrs. W. H. Brill & Co. — Gentlemen: — I have used your 
Pain Eradicator in my family for some time, and it has really 
proven a wonderful remedy. I have given it to persons who suf- 
fered the most terrible pains in the back, Xeuralgic pains in the 
head, Toothache, Sore Throat, &c., and the result was surprising. 
In the many cases where I udcd and recommended it it universally 
gave relief In fact I do not know of a single instance where it 
failed. Being a pleasant clean preparation, containing no grease or 
stain, agreeable to taste and smell, I know of no remedy which 
I can recommend with the same confidence. 

Very truly yours, SAMUEL C. CLOW. 

Mr. Thojias Scott, Allegheny, had been .suffering for some 
time from Chronic Diarrhoea, accompanied by severe ciiolic and 
griping; he had tried numerous remedies without obtaining relief; 
he hnally tried the Pain Eradicator, and to his astonishment, the 
first few doses cured him, he now uses it regularly himself and in 
his family, considering it the only safe and reliable remedy for 
these maladies. - 

Mr. W. H. Parke, Tobacconist. No 75 Federal street, Alle- 
gheny, has been using the Pain Eradicator for Neuralgia and 
various other pains and aches, and asserts that he would never be 
without it, and invariably recommends it to his friends who may 
be in need of a liniment. 

IMr. J. F. Keely, Druggist, No. S71 Rebecca street, Alle- 
gheny, has been selling the Pain Eradicator for some time, and says 
he never knew of any instance where he sold it but what it gave en- 
tire satisfaction, and now invariablv recommeilds it to his customers.

power of the Encephalon ; the former may be called sympathetic, 
and the latter nervous headache, the treatment of the first should 
consist in restoring the healthy action of the stomach by the 
administration of aperients, and the use of proper food and ex- 
ercise. Nervous headaehe.s are relieved by nervous tonics and 
stimulants, as Peruvian Bark, Cascarilla, Columbo, Gentian, Cam- 
phor, &c., or apply the Pain Eradicator by means of a soft silk 
cloth, and take fifteen drops in water every hour or two which will 
invariably afford relief. A cup of strong coffee or tea often acts 
like a charm ; silence, darkness and repose are also powerful 
remedies, alike suitable to every variety of headache.

[^Froni his Honor the Mayor of Allegheny CiVy.] 

Allegheny, Pa., August 12th, 1868. 
Messrs. W. H. Brill & Co. — Gentlemen: — 1 take occasion to 
volunteer my testimony in favor of your valuable Pain Eradicator. 
I have used it myself for Ivheumatism, and in my family for 
numberless pains and aches, with entire satisfaction, and I hereby 
freely assure you that it has always accomplished what it claims 
to do. Yours very truly, SIMON DRUM. 



Messrs. W. H. Brill & Co. — Gentlemen: — Your Pain Eradi- 
cator has cured me of Rheumatism, which had given me the most 
excruciating pain at intervals for nearly tliree yeai-s; my joints, 
es{)ecially those of my feet, were dreadt'ully swollen at times, so 
that I could scarcely walk ; my shoulders also pained me and gave 
me great trouble ; by the aid of your valuable remedy I have been 
entirely cured. Eespectfullv vours, 

Mrs. Capt. G. W. REED, 

59 Taylor avenue, Allegheny, Pa. 



Sewickley, Pa., Feb. 1st, 1870. 
Mr. W. H. Brill: — I have suffered severely for several 
months from Inflam.matory Rheumatism, for wliich I could obtain 
no relief, although I used a great variety of medicines; I was 
finally induced to try your Pain Eradicator, which produced the 
most gratifying results, in less than two weeks I was entirely cured, 
and now suffer no inconvenience whatever. 

Very truly yours, CHARLES SEVIN. 

Allegheny, Pa., November 14th, 1868. 
Messrs. W. H. Brill <fe Co. — Gentleraen: — I had been suffer- 
ing for years with periodical attacks of Neuralgia in my head, for

cure. Re?i)eclful!y yours, \VM. T. MOOREHEAD, 5

IT& CAUSES AjYD TREAT ME J^T. 



NetJ&aLGia is a term of recent origin, employed to designate 
pain of a purely nervous character. The pain is of every possible 
degree and variety of character, but is generally severe, acute, and 
more or less darting or lancinating. It is sometimes described as 
piercing, tearing, aching, burning, tingling, benumbing, &c., and 
language has been ransacked to find terras strong and expressive 
enough to represent at once its intensity and exti-eme diversity. 
The pain may either be confined to the course of a single nerve 
and its ramifications, or may be diffused without reference to such 
limits, and sometimes darts rapidly from one point to another, be- 
tween which there is no immediate nervous communication. 

In relation to the condition of the system associated with neural- 
gia; it may be perfectly healtiiy, or in various degrees debilitated; 
it may be plethoric or enemic. The patient may also be subject to 
a variety of diseases that may have great bearing on the complaint. 

A vast diversity of remedies have been used with various results, 
the main point should always be to ascertain if possible, whether 
the organic functions are all in a healthy condition. Dyspepsia, 
acidity of the stomach ; the immoderate use of strong coffee, tea, 
tobacco, alcoholic drinks, Ac, may be the source of the mischief, 
and can with a little care be detected; the first named .should be 
treated properly, and the latter abstained from ; the bowels must 
be kept open with cathartics, and the general system kept in as 
good a condition as possible, or take when the attack comes on, 
a teaspoonful of PAIN ERADICATOE diluted with water, inter- 
nally, and bathe the parts affected freely, relief is sure to follow.

viously rubbed through a clean hair sieve, or when the flavor 
depends on the juice of fruit, or an essential oil, by adding a 
sufficient quantity of such substance. Thus, Raspberry and Straw- 
berry Creams are made according to the former method ; Lemon, 
Orange, and Almond Ice Creams are made by the latter. In the 
same v/ay any other article besides cream may be frozen. 

ice Cream, Cheap. 

For six quarts of Milk, take half a pound of Corn Starch ; first 
dissolve the Corn Starch in one quart of the Milk, then mix all 
together, and simmer a little over a slow fire, sweeten and flavor to 
taste, and freeze in the same manner as above. 

Jellies Without Fruit. 

Take one pint of Water, to which add Powdered Alum one- 
quarter ounce and boil a minute or two; then add White Sugar four 
pounds, and continue the boiling until the Sugar is dissolved. Take 
from the fire and strain while hot, allow it to cool, then add of any 
flavor you desire half an ounce of Vanilla, Strawberry, Lemon, or 
any other; the Jelly must also be colored according to the fruit you 
wish to imitate. This will make a Jelly so much like that made 
from fruit that it is difficult to distinguish them, and answers very 
well when fruit cannot be obtained. 

Jelly, Cranberry or Quince- 
Pare, quarter and core the Quinces, put them in a saucepan 
with enough water to cover them, let them boil five minutes, put in 
a bag and let drain until the next day ; to every pint of Juice take 
one pound of Sugar and boil from fifteen to twenty minutes. Apple 
^ Jelly is made in the same way.

Is a constitutional afli:ction, attended with a peculiar irritation or 
inflammation, to which all parts of the system are liable. Eheuma- 
tisni may be divided according to its seat, or its grade of excite- 
ment, thus the following four varieties may be recognized : 1. The, 
Acute, in which violent local inflammation is attended with conflid- 
erable constitutional disturbance or fever. 2. The Subacute, in which 
the inflammation is less violent, and there is little or no fever. 3. 
The Chronic, characterized by long duration, and the lowest grade 
of inflammatory action. 4. The Nervous, in which there is neither 
inflammation nor fever, the disease existing exclusively in irrita- 
tion, and tliat directed cppecially to the nervous tissue. Having 
taken a view of the different forms of Kheumatism, we should next 
consider its nature. The opinion at one time prevalent that this 
disease was dependent on a peculiar offending matter pervading the 
system must be looked on as purely speculative. Another notion is, 
that tlie disease ia nothing more than ordinary inflammation. But 
the truth is that the disease is not necessarily inflammatory, but is 
often purely nervous, and no other explanation of its nature is ad- 
missible which does not take this foct into consideration. (Wood's 
practice, vol. 1, fol. 5G'2.) The above proves that Eheumatism is 
often nervous and can be reached by the application of local reme- 
dies such as rubefacient and anodyne liniments, of which Brill's 
Pain Eradicator is the best and most effectual. Flannel, carded 
wool, or cotton moistened with it and covered over the part 
affected, has proven very successful. General treatment, such as 
active purging, refrigerant diaphoretics, warm baths, &c., often be- 
come necessary in severe cases. Where there is great excitement 
and violent pain, ten or fifteen drops of Pain Eradicator, diluted 
with Avater, may be given every two hours, until rest or sleep is 
produced.
