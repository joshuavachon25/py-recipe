PREFACE 

This book has been written in response to the many 
requests for practical help in the planning of menus 
and for the recipes in use in the cafeteria under the 
management of the authors. 

This book is designed primarily to assist the managers 
of food departments in institutions. However, it 
is hoped that the chapters on menu planning, the 
recipes, and the list of weights and their approximate 
measures may prove useful as a text for those teachers 
of institution management who have the problem of 
teaching large quantity cookery and menu planning.

QUANTITY COOKERY 



CHAPTER I 

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE PLANNING OF MENUS 
FOR LARGE NUMBERS 

Well-balanced and appropriate menus are abso- 
lutely necessary to the success of any establishment 
serving food. Given the best of raw materials and 
the most competent cooks, the institutional manager 
will fail to please his patrons if his menus show lack 
of careful planning. The truth of this assertion is veri- 
fied by the analysis of many failures. 

On the other hand successful menu planning is not 
especially difficult. Like any other art it requires 
careful study and observance of a few simple rules. 

Of course, it is impossible to formulate one set of 
rules that will apply to all situations. Each mana- 
ger must make his own rules based on the conditions 
he has to meet. There are, however, certain basic 
principles to be recognized and followed. If the en- 
suing chapters succeed in explaining these principles 
and in emphasizing their importance, the authors' 
purpose will have been served. 

In planning menus for an institution the manager 
must: 

Keep in mind the nature of the institution; its 
purpose ; the character of its patronage. 

Follow certain dietetic principles. 

Maintain constant variety in the food. 



2 QUANTITY COOKERY 

Keep menus appropriate to the temperature; the 
weather ; the season ; occasional holidays. 

Recognize the Hmitations imposed by equipment; 
amount and kind of help; range of cost permitted; 
left-over foods to be used ; form of service. 

The first point to consider in planning a menu is 
the type of institution to be served. For reasons 
that are obvious, the purpose of the high school cafe- 
teria is very different from that of the metropolitan 
hotel, while neither of these has the same object as the 
municipal tuberculosis sanitarium. 

The age, sex, nationality, economic condition and 
occupation of the patrons must be kept in mind. The 
adult demands a freedom of choice which may be denied 
children. For this reason the content of the grade 
school lunch may be fixed in an arbitrary way, while 
this will not do when one is dealing with adults of any 
class. For instance, grade school children are satis- 
fied with the morning bowl of bread and milk and the 
noon lunch of bread and soup. Adults, even in a 
charitable home, would undoubtedly complain of the 
simplicity of such meals. The high school lunchroom 
may eliminate colFee from its menu and have frequent 
"pieless" days. Any such attempts to regulate the 
diet of adults, except for patriotic reasons such as 
were the incentive to denial during the war, are highly 
inadvisable. 

As far as the food elements are concerned, the same 
kinds of food may be served to boys and girls or to 
men and women. But, practically, they will not eat 
the same foods with equal satisfaction, and this should 
influence the planning of menus in different institutions. 

School lunch managers and social service workers 
have found that in order to accomplish their aims 
they have to recognize racial food tastes. 



MENUS FOR LARGE NUMBERS 3 

The eccHiomic condition of the group to be served 
may limit variety in the menu, on the one hand, or 
may permit of maximum variety on the other. The 
eight-page menu of the fashionable tea room as defi- 
nitely reflects the ability of the patrons to pay as does 
the simple meal of three or four dishes served the 
immigrants at Ellis Island. 

The occupation of the patrons, whether active or 
sedentary, determines to a large extent the kind of 
food served to them, from the dietetic standpoint and 
from the commercial standpoint as well. The lumber- 
jacks of the north woods require a diet very different 
in quality and quantity from that of the telephone 
operators in a city exchange. 

In institutions serving set menus, with little or no 
choice, special attention should be given to dietetic 
principles. Examples of such institutions are college 
dining halls or dormitories, hospitals, benevolent 
"homes", boarding houses, fraternities and clubs. 

For those who have had little or no training in 
dietetics and who yet have the responsibility of plan- 
ning menus, it may be said that if ample variety is 
provided, with emphasis on fruits and vegetables, the 
dietetic requirements will probably be met. 

The sequence of foods in the menu is important. 
Where several courses are to be served, and it is the 
aim of those planning the menu to keep the appetite 
stimulated, acids, meat extractives and warm foods 
should be served first. Cloying foods such as sweets, 
very cold foods and foods which are satisfying tend 
to depress the appetite and hence have no place in the 
first course of a meal, except for luncheon where the 
menu may be very simple. In institutions which 
have fixed menus, it is especially desirable that the 
meal, no matter how simple, be so planned that it may 



4 QUANTITY COOKERY 

be served in courses. Children especially are likely 
to hurry through their meals, and the serving of food 
in courses prevents too rapid eating. It is true, of 
course, that extra service requires more labor, and so 
may not prove possible, even though desirable. 

The responsibility for maintaining a constant variety 
in food calls for the continued exercise of initiative, 
the determination to avoid monotonous repetition, a 
mind open to new foods and new methods of prepara- 
tion and systematic marketing trips in order to keep 
in touch with seasonal changes. Perhaps the most 
frequent criticism of institutions is on the lack of 
variety in meals. Hotels, clubs and tea rooms can 
draw trade by serving out-of-season foods when they 
first appear in the market. Institutions whose pur- 
chases are limited by a budget should make the most 
of seasonal foods when the market is at its height and 
the food is cheapest. Such institutions should avoid 
serving foods that are not actually in season. Serving 
berries or melons before the height of the season dulls 
the appetite of the patron for these foods so that by the 
time they have become economical to serve he has tired 
of them. 

Variety should be introduced not only in the kinds 
of food but in the preparation, garnish and service. 
Even in charitable homes and other institutions where 
the aim is to serve at a minimum cost, the menus can 
be made attractive through variety in preparation. 
Corn meal and cottage cheese, two of the least expensive 
foods we have, can be utilized in a wide variety of ways. 
There should be no hesitation about serving new 
dishes, for maximum variety is essential to a happy 
patronage whether in the tea room or the benevolent 
institution. The point to be kept in mind, where the 
guest has the privilege of selection, is that all the 



MENUS FOR LARGE NUMBERS s 

variety should not come within the day or meal but 
within the week or month. Surprise always helps 
to induce appetite and this fact is as applicable to the 
menu in the children's home as to that of the tea room. 

It is good business practice as well as good dietetic 
practice to plan meals according to the weather and 
the time of year. Hot, heavy foods sell best in cold 
weather. Cool, crisp, fresh foods sell best on the hot- 
test days. The public is very susceptible to weather 
conditions. Holidays give a popularity to certain 
foods which they enjoy at no other time of the year. 
It is good business to make the most of these foods 
by serving them on appropriate days. 

There are definite relations between the menu and 
the equipment available for its execution. For instance, 
a menu which calls for oven cooking to the exclusion 
of the use of the top of the stove or supplementary 
steamers will be impossible to carry out. The menu 
should be planned in order that the cooking may be 
divided between all the available equipment, such as 
ovens, steamers and top space on stoves. In the 
kitchen, as in the industrial plant, it is good manage- 
ment to give space only to efficient equipment and 
to use that equipment to its maximum capacity. 

Again, incomplete equipment may have to be con- 
sidered in planning the menu. If there is no power 
machinery the amount of hand work or heavy physical 
preparation called for may have to be cut down in 
accordance with the equipment at hand. In serving 
large numbers power machinery will often pay for 
itself in a few months through the saving in labor. 
It will not only do the work better and more humanely 
but will allow a much greater variety of food. In the 
matter of equipment the institution must get away 
from the idea that it is a large home, with working 



6 QUANTITY COOKERY 

conditions as they have been in the average home. It 
should consider] itself an industrial plant where one of 
the aims is maximum production with minimum labor ; 
and it should realize that proper equipment and proper 
working conditions are necessary in the accomplishment 
of this aim. Even though the labor supply may be 
adequate, efficient planning of menus demands that 
there be an adjustment between those foods requiring 
much labor and those requiring little, so that proper 
balance may be maintained. 

In discussing the limitations in menu making the 
element of cost has come up again and again. It 
becomes a definite restriction in institutions that work 
on a budget, or where the group to be served demands 
good wholesome food at the lowest price. As examples 
of such institutions there are the factory cafeteria, 
the school lunch and the college cafeteria. 

Though menus must be made out in advance of the 
day when they are to be used, they should be sufficiently 
elastic to allow for proper utilization of left-overs. 
Using left-overs may mean very little change and 
substitution, or may require complete revision of the 
day's meals. Left-overs must be used, for it is only 
by constant care that the food cost can be kept down 
to a minimum. That this is true of all institutions, 
whether great or small, is shown by the extreme care 
exercised in the largest hotels to the end that no food 
shall be wasted. Where there is family service, rather 
than plate service from the kitchen, there will probably 
be a large amount of left-over food. It requires a good 
deal of ingenuity to use these left-overs in some other 
form so as to maintain variety and that element of 
surprise which is so essential. In the cafeteria or other 
institution using a la carte service the left-over problem 
is not so serious. It is very nicely taken care of in tea 



MENUS FOR LARGE NUMBERS 7 

rooms and hotels which serve a club luncheon, the menu 
for which may be chiefly made up from the left-overs. 
It is obvious that the form of service may influence 
the kind and extent of the menu. That is, the cafe- 
teria can serve a large variety of dishes because the 
patrons wait on themselves. A similar choice or variety 
is impracticable where there is table service, except 
in hotels, restaurants and tea rooms where cost is not so 
great a factor. 



CHAPTER II 



STANDARDS FOR JUDGING MEALS 

Provided the principles of good nutrition have not 
been violated, the main basis for judging any meal is 
palatability. Palatability depends upon appearance 
and quality. Appearance in turn depends upon quan- 
tity, color, form and service upon the plate. Qual- 
ity is determined by odor, flavor, temperature, texture 
and consistency. Reduced to outline form, the ele- 
ments of palatability are : 



Palatability 



appearance 



quality 



quantity 

color 

form 

neatness 

arrangement 

odor 

temperature 

flavor 

texture 

consistency 



Commercially and aesthetically it is unwise to make 
servings too large. Every one has had the experience 
of being served with more food than can be eaten with 
relish and without waste. The eff"ect is to surfeit the 
appetite and to limit the variety which a patron may 
have, unless he is able financially to order the variety ; 
in which case he is obliged to leave some food uneaten. 
In any institution which serves a la carte, it is better to 
adjust portions and prices to the end that the patron 



STANDARDS FOR JUDGING MEALS 9 

may have some variety in his meal without prohibitive 
expense. 

Color is important in inducing appetite. The caf- 
eteria counter displaying a bufF-colored pie, snow pud- 
ding, rice custard and yellow cake does not tempt 
patrons to buy. A basket of fruit, a bright-colored 
gelatin dessert or attractive garnishes may transform a 
drab meal into a most interesting one. Particularly 
in all kinds of plate service, attention must be paid to 
color, for while clashing color combinations must be 
avoided, some color must be used to give the food an 
appetizing appearance. A great deal of our food is very 
neutral in color and admits of a liberal use of garnishes 
of one kind or another. 

As a rule articles of food served together should be 
of diverse shapes. One may enjoy a croquette, a 
stuffed baked potato, peas in timbales and a roll in the 
same meal, but it is usually unwise to serve them on the 
same plate. 

The necessity for neatness and orderly arrangement 
of servings is obvious. At large parties where there is 
plate service it is wise to make up a sample plate before 
the time of serving in order to determine the best 
arrangement of food and in order actually to show 
those who are to dish up the food how each plate must 
look when it is placed before the guest. One who is 
inexperienced in planning menus, especially for parties, 
should accustom himself to visualizing the meal as it 
will appear when written upon the menu card and as 
it will appear upon the plate. A menu which has 
seemed very good when planned will often be unsatis- 
factory when actually served because some of the above 
points have been overlooked. 

Odor and temperature are important factors in qual- 
ity. It would seem superfluous to say that hot things 



lo QUANTITY COOKERY 

must be served hot and cold things must be served cold, 
yet in serving large numbers the strict observance of 
these rules is one of the difficult problems to be solved. 
It can be solved, however, with efficient equipment prop- 
erly arranged, a carefully thought out organization of 
service and unceasing care. 

Repetition of texture and consistency should also be 
avoided. That is to say, there should be the maximum 
variety in preparation of food in order that no meal 
shall contain two or more creamed dishes, fried foods, 
foods with custard basis or foods with bread foundation. 

If a score card were made out for judging a meal, 
flavor would perhaps be given the most importance. 
Here again care must be taken to avoid duplicating 
flavors. Too many strong flavors or too many bland 
flavors are undesirable. While strong flavors stimulate 
the appetite it is unwise to employ them continually, 
especially where the same group of people is being served 
day after day. A more blandly flavored diet is likely 
to be less palling and more constantly inviting. 

In serving the public, whether it be in the hospital, 
the college dormitory or the commercial restaurant, the 
aim should always be to have the food better than that 
to which the patrons are accustomed. 

In almost any kind of food work, and especially in 
institutional food work, visiting trips to the best hotels, 
tea rooms, inns, cafeterias and restaurants are inval- 
uable, since they impart a knowledge of the way things 
are done, which in turn creates a confidence and assur- 
ance that nothing else can give. 



CHAPTER III 

types of menus 

Cafeteria Menus 

Though it may be necessary to offer slightly more 
choice in foods in the commercial cafeteria, some cafe- 
terias offer such a wide variety of choice that the patron 
is confused and has difficulty in choosing his meal. 
Furthermore too much variety makes for s?imeness 
from day to day. In all cafeterias where the same 
group is served each day, and where there is little or 
no competition, a simpler menu may be used. The 
following menu outline is suggested for use in the 
average cafeteria. 

A Standard Form for Cafeteria Menu 

1 soup 1-2 hot breads 

2 meats 1-2 sandwiches 
(l meat substitute) 2-3 salads 

I kind of potatoes 2-3 relishes 

2-3 vegetables 6-8 desserts 

4 beverages 

Meats 
One inexpensive meat should be served in each 

meal. 
Two made-over meats should not be served in the 

same meal. 
Two kinds of beef or pork or two kinds of any other 

variety of meat should not be served in the same 

meal. 



12 QUANTITY COOKERY 

Potatoes 

Creamed potatoes may be served with meat lacking 

gravy or sauce. 
It is seldom advisable to serve mashed potatoes 

unless there is a meat gravy to offer with 

them. 

Vegetables 
When possible one vegetable should be starchy 

and one should be succulent. 
Two creamed or two fried or two buttered vege- 
tables should not be served in the same meal. 

Breads 

Raised breads and quick breads give a good variety. 

Salads 
There should be at least one inexpensive salad. 
The variety in salads may consist of one fruit 

salad, one vegetable salad and one salad in which 

protein predominates, such as cottage cheese, 

meat or fish. 
Head lettuce salad is universally popular and may 

appear at every meal. 
In salad dressings, there should always be a cooked 

dressing, French dressing and mayonnaise. 

Other varieties may be added as desired. 

Desserts 
Variety in desserts includes : 
Fruit in some form. 

A pudding with a dough or bread foundation. 
Two cold puddings. 
One kind of ice cream. 
One kind of cake. 



TYPES OF MENUS 13 

One kind of pie. 

One-crust and two-crust pies should so far as 
possible be alternated in successive menus. 
Two or more kinds of pie may be demanded, 
but when possible patrons should be edu- 
cated to other choices in desserts. 
Beverages 

Milk should be served in bottles (with provision 
for opening). 

Thirty Days' Menus for a Cafeteria 

The careful manager spends a great deal of time in 
menu planning. If some systematic method of menu 
making can be adopted and used with a mind constantly 
alert to seasonal changes in foods, new and attractive 
dishes and variety in serving, the plan may result in 
saving much of this time. 

A set of menus for thirty days has been worked out, 
with the idea that they may be repeated at the end of 
that time without too monotonous repetition. No 
Sunday meals are included since the majority of cafe- 
terias are closed on that day. The Friday menus 
occur on the fifth day and every sixth day thereafter. 
No menu is shown for Saturday night when, if a meal 
is served, it may consist of popular dishes such as 
chicken in some form, waffles or steaks, along with 
such left-overs as it may be desirable to use. 

The menus are intended to serve as a foundation to 
which may be added new dishes and seasonable fruits 
and vegetables, a suggestive list of which is given else- 
where (see pages 57-59). From these foundation menus 
may be eliminated such dishes as are unpopular or out 
of season, or which for any reason it is impractical to 
serve. Commercial cafeterias may find it necessary 
to add other choices to these menus. Very small cafe- 



14 



QUANTITY COOKERY 



terias may offer fewer choices. The majority of estab- 
lishments, however, will find this variety ample, the 
idea being to serve the maximum variety within the 
week rather than within the day or meal. 

A star has been used to indicate those dishes in which 
left-overs may be used to particular advantage.

Tea-room Menus 

The tea-room menu is characterized by daintiness 
and excellence in food, garnish and service. Large 
tea rooms serve a variety such as is found in large

TYPES OF MENUS 37 

hotels, with practically no changes in their menus 
from day to day. They are open to the same criticism 
as are the cafeterias that serve everything in the market 
at every meal, and so make their menu monotonous. 
Smaller tea rooms offer limited choices, — soups, rel- 
ishes, hot dishes, vegetables, salads, breads and bev- 
erages. To add choices to a menu beyond the num- 
ber which will satisfy the patrons is not economy. 
The longer the menu list, the more labor, equipment, 
food wastage and spoilage. Therefore the tea-room menu 
list should be as simple as is consistent with the demands 
of those to be served. The menus shown below are of 
the type which are changed from day to day. The 
first is a very good example of this type, embodying 
a moderate degree of choice. It is suitable for a tea 
room serving perhaps six hundred or more people daily.

Popular Food Combinations 

Since it is customary to plan the menu, using the 
meat as a basis, and since custom and good usage make 
certain combinations popular, a list of such combinations

Garnishes 

Clever use of garnishes will do a great deal to make 
servings attractive, to develop surprise and stimulate 
appetite. 

A list of garnishes appropriate to diflFerent kinds of 
food appears below. Of course there are many others, 
and the number of different ways in which ordinary 
garnishes can be used effectively is surprisingly large. 
The alert manager will observe what others in his field 
are doing, and will discover many ingenious ideas by 
reading food journals and women's magazines. 

The garnishes used for soups are practically the same 
whether for cream or clear soups. 
Wafers, cheese and plain Radishes 
Croutons Celery hearts 

Olives Whipped cream (on cream 

soups) 
Some meat garnishes can be used at all times ; others 
are especially adapted to certain kinds of meat.

should be made as appetizing as possible by the use of 
suitable garnishes. 

Pickles 

Olives

Attractive paper or plain linen doilies 

Nut meats 

Desserts by their very nature, require some garnish 
to make them the perfect and satisfying last course 
which they should be. Candied fruit, marshmallows, 
slices of fresh orange or strawberries in season, whipped 
cream and bright candies add the needed bit of color. 
Here the use of paper doilies, glasses and attractively 
shaped china dishes is a great factor in appearance. 



CHAPTER V 

FORMS 

The Importance and Use of Forms 

Printed forms or other practical aids which may 
help to reduce menu planning to a systematic routine 
are invaluable. Forms such as the party engagement 
blanks, shown elsewhere, and the meat order blank and 
menu blanks below tend to a desirable standardization. 
Since meat orders for the week are usually made out 
first and the menus planned around the meats, a form 
similar to the one shown below, with adaptations for 
the particular institution, may be helpful. 

The lists of foods and the list of seasonal changes 
and garnishes contained in this book will save mental 
effort and tedium in planning by suggesting new 
combinations and variety. 

Probably no single device will serve different kinds 
of institutions, but the principle of using appropriate 
printed forms to help in remembering details holds 
good for all institutions.

An Outline Form for Special Dinners 

The efficiency of an organization is judged by the 
degree of routine which each phase of the work assumes. 
In most institutions the serving of special dinners is 
quite apart from the ordinary routine of business. 
If this service is to be handled simply and efficiently, 
all of its various steps must be listed and taken up in 
an orderly fashion with the end in view of perfecting 
an emergency organization as efficient as that which 
regulates the daily tasks. 

First of all, arrangements made with those who are 
giving the dinner should be definite and complete. In 
order to prevent misunderstandings, a printed blank 
such as that shown below (with any adaptations found 
necessary) will prove helpful. This may be made out 
in duplicate, one copy being retained by the manager 
and one by those engaging the services. 

Reduced to their simplest form, the steps to be fol- 
lowed in organizing this work are outlined below.

CHAPTER VI 

RECIPES 

In the pages that follow are some two hundred 
recipes for use in institutions. It will be noted that 
throughout these recipes, measures are used rather 
than weights. This for two main reasons. First, 
cooks, except for highly trained professionals, use 
measures more easily and with greater success than 
weights. Second, most institutions cannot afford an 
adequate number of accurate scales; and scales that 
are not accurate are worse than useless. Measures, 
on the other hand, are inexpensive and always avail- 
able. It may be said that because of the amounts and 
the size of the measures used in large quantity cookery 
there is not the degree of inaccuracy which is found 
in measuring small quantities. 

It is hoped the form of the recipes with the spaces for 
figuring costs and calories will be of value from the 
commercial and classroom standpoint. 

Stars indicate those recipes in which left-overs may 
be used to particular advantage.

Cut the meat in cubes and soak two thirds of it in 
the cold water for about three fourths of an hour. 
Sear the remainder and add to the meat which is soak- 
ing. Heat the meat, veal bone and water to boiling 
and let simmer for four or five hours. Add the sea- 
sonings and the vegetables and cook until the vegetables 
are soft. Pour the whole through a colander and 
cool. When the fat has set, remove and clear by mix- 
ing the cold stock with the shells and slightly beaten 
whites of eggs. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring 
constantly. Let simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Strain 
through two or three thicknesses of cheese cloth.

Scald the milk. Soften the yeast in the two cups of 
lukewarm water. Add the sugar and fat to the scalded 
milk and then add the two quarts of water. When the 
milk and water mixture is a little more than lukewarm 
add the yeast and five quarts of flour. Beat to smooth 
batter and let rise one hour. Then add the salt and the 
remainder of the flour. Beat on the machine or knead. 
Let rise one hour. When the dough is light, cut into 
small pieces, getting twelve rolls from each pound of 
dough. With the palm of the hand, roll these pieces 
into smooth balls and place them in rows to rise. When 
they have again become light, roll the balls flat, with 
a rolling pin or stick, brush with melted fat, fold over 
and put in pans to rise. When they have doubled in 
size, bake in a hot oven until well browned. The tops 
may be brushed with melted fat, when they come from 
the oven.

Mix and sift the dry ingredients. Rub in the 
shortening lightly, with the tips of the fingers. Add 
the milk gradually, mixing to a soft dough. The 
amount of milk may vary due to differences in the flour. 
Put the dough on to a board and roll out to about one 
third inch in thickness. Cut out, using a cutter three 
inches in diameter. Brush the tops with melted fat and 
place one biscuit on top of the other; bake in a hot 
oven. When baked, the shortcakes break open easily. 
Serve with fruit between the halves and on top.

Cream the fat and sugar thoroughly. Add the 
yolks and vanilla and continue creaming. Mix the 
dry ingredients and add alternately with the milk to 
the fat, sugar and eggs. Fold in the well-beaten whites 
last. If a kitchen mixing machine is used for making 
the cake, the best results are obtained by creaming the 
fat and sugar twenty to thirty minutes on the machine
