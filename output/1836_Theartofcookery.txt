PREFACE. 



Having been so many years in their service, as 
owner of the Freemason's Tavern, before its present 
respected occupant, and Mattre d^Hdtel in other 
well-known localities, the author trusts, with some 
degree of confidence, that the public will not be 
displeased to receive the receipts for those dishes 
they have so often welcomed when set before them. 
They are the fruits of long experience, and in their 
composition he has been guided by the well-known 
axiom, that ^' it is the guests who are to decide on 
the merits of the feast, and not the caterer." 
Thus, although the author has admitted no receipt 
into his work which is not in accordance with the 
scientific principles of his art, yet he has permitted 

a2 



IV PREFACE. 

none to have a place in it, merely because it is 
theoretically correct : each has been over and over 
again submitted to that best committee of taste — 
the public. 

As the aim of art is ever to simplify, the most 
frugal housekeeper may consult this work on the 
score of economy, no less than the more ambitious 
cook for the sake of a guide to scientific prindples 
and refined luxury. The language is studiouBly 
plain; the directions brief, yet clear; the ingre- 
dients i^portioAed with a sdrupulous jealousy of 
the expenditure, but at no sacrifice to the interests 
of the palate. 

In strict adherence with the title, the present 
work is confined to the full development of 
Cookery as an art. Each section is head«d ' by 
general observations, and directions for the plain 
cooking of the respective articles to which it' is 
devoted ; the more c<Hnplez modes of preparation 
follow. By rejecting receipts which have no 
connection with the table, but which are too often 



PREFACE. T 

incongrttously inaerted in similar publications, tlie 
author has been enabled to be much more fall than 
is usual on the mysteries of pastry, confectionary, 
and sweetmeats, which are most important items in 
every family, and belong of right to the domain of 
die cook. The last position will not be denied, 
when it is remembered that the most philosophical 
cooks of antiquity (the Athenians) piqued them- 
selves on the variety and excellence of their farinace- 
ous compositions, and that the cake, or bread, termed 
CribaniteSi is said to have been so delicious as even 
to cause appetite by eating. To attain this last 
result is the cunne of successful cookery ! 

Few directions are given for marketing, and 
none for carving. A volume might easily be writ- 
ten on either, and well written tooy and the tyro be 
just as advanced after as before reading it Obser- 
vation and practice can alone teach these two aux- 
iliaries to the science of gastronomy. Bills of Fare 
are furnished for the several months, more as guides 
to the articles in season, and as affording hints for 

the elegant disposition of the table, than with any 

Ad 



yi PREFACE. 

desire that they should be implicitly followed. To 
. insist on cleanliness as essential to the thorough 
cooky is hardly necessary; but it may not be unim- 
portant to suggest) that the accomplished one will 
aim rather at imitating than servilely following^ 
will adhere to the spirit rather than the letter of a 
receipt) will at times judiciously innovate, and at 
others boldly invent. 

Numerous alterations have been made in the pre* 
sent edition and among the additions, the author 
begs to draw attention to the receipt for dressing 
WHITE BAIT) a dish hitherto omitted in worhs on 
Cookery, but surely of interest to the Amphitryons 
of the metropolis.

b5 



10 ART or COOKERY. 

remove the lean from the bone. Scald the fins

joram, savory, thyme, basil, parsley, twelve onions, 
twenty-four shalots, and about eighteen middling-

callipash. Then strain the whole of the liquor, 
and thicken it with a passing of flour and butter, 
taking care not to make it too thick. Season with 
Cayenne pepper and salt, add a pint of boiling 
Sherry wine, and strain it to the turtle, adding 
some scalded egg and forcemeat balls. If there 
is any green fat, boil it till tender, cut it into 
pieces, and put it to the turtle ; and five minutes 



SOUPS, BROTHS, &C. 11 

before serviag, add another pint of boilmg Sherry 
mnef and some lemon juice. Let the whole .stew 
gently till tender, and serve in tureens.

&c. then stew till tender, and the liquor almost 
reduced to a glaze. Serve in a deep dish, pasted

b6 



12 ART OF COOKERY.

bably the best, as it frequenily hiqppens the shell 
of the callipee is not properly baked.

and let it boil for half an hour. Strain the liquor 
and thicken it with flour and butter passed. Season 
it with pepper and salt, and strain it to the pieces 
of the head. Then add some scalded forcemeat 
and egg-balls boiled gently till tender; and five 
minutes before serving add a little lemon juice, and 
half a pint of boiling Sherry wine.

then add all together; make it hot, and, five minutes 
before serving, add a liaison of three yolks of eggs 
and cream.

should be set in a pot of boiling water. 

FISH MEAGRE SOUP. 

Take some cleaned skate, or other fish, cut it 
into pieces, and put it into a stew-pan with a blade 
of mace, two turnips, two good-sized onions, and

broth if not for meagre soup,) till it is done ; then 
add two anchovies boned, and strain and clear it 
with one egg beat up with a whisk. Add a little 
liquid of colour, and strain it through a tamis cloth ; 
after which two ounces of vermicelli may be put 
into it.

cut off the red part only in thin slices, and put 
them into a stewpan with a quart of water ; add 
cleaned turnips, celery, leeks, and onions, cut in 
pieces, and half a pint of split peas. Stew ail 
together till tender, adding some broth to prevent 
burning; then rub it through a tamis cloth, and 
put to the pulp five pints of veal broth, and some 
blanched water-cresses; boil for twenty minutes,

appearance ; but, as an exception, skate will be 
better for eating if kept for one or two days in a 
cool place before it is dressed. 

Fish plain boiled should be prepared Aus : — Put 
them into dean boiling pump water well salted, and 
on serving garnish with fresh pidced parsley and 
scraped horse-radish. Salt fish should be properly 
soaked, then cut in pieces and put into cold water, 
and, after boiling, let it simmer six or eight minutes, 
and serve on a napkin, with boiled parsnips and 
potatoes round, or on a plate, and egg sauce in

SCALLOPED OYSTSRS. 

Blanch and strain the oysters ; then add to their 
liquor, which must be free from sediment, a large 
piece of fresh butter, a little pepper and salt, some 
lemon peel, and grated nutmeg. Beard and wash 
the fish, add them to the ingredients, sinmier them 
oyer a fire five minutes, and put them into scallop 
^ells with the liquor. If there be more than 
suffident, boil it till nearly reduced and add it; 
then put fine bread crumbs over, smooth them with 
a knife, and shake a little sweet oil over the 
bread crumbs with a paste brush. Bake or set them 
over a fire upon a gridiron for half an hour, and 
colour the top part with a salamander. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS {Another way). 

Put some fine bread crumbs and sweet oil to- 
gether; mould the shells with the mixture, and 
bake of a nice colour. Ten minutes before serving, 
fill the shells with stewed oysters, done in the 
same manner as above, and when they are to be 
sent to table, pour over the oysters a little hot 
cream which has been boiled down. 

TO FRY OYSTERS. 

Open twenty-four large oysters; blanch them 
with their own liquor ; and when three parts done, 
strain them, and preserve the liquor; then wash 
and let them drain. In the mean while make a

batter with four taUe-cpoonsfiil of flour, two ^^ 
a little pepper and salt, and the liquor. Beat it 
well with a wooden spoom or a whisk for five 
minutes. Put the oysters into the batter, mix 
them lightly, and have ready boiling laid. Take 
the oysters out singly with a fork, put them into 
the lard, and fry them of a nice brown colour.

anchovies, a bay leaf, horse-radish scraped, a small 
quantity of lemon peel, and some Port wine ; season 
it well with Cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice ; 
and when it boils, and is of a proper thickness, 
strain it to the fish ; then stew it gently, and serve 
in « deep dish with the liquor, and fried bread 
round it. If carp or tench, some of the hard roe 
should be mixed in batter and fried in pieces. 
The roes likewise of different fish may be stewed 
in the same manner, and served as a dish of them- 
selves. Eels, soles, or other fish may be done 
the same way. 

ENTREE OF FISH IN A MOULD.

OBSERVATIONS ON MEAT AND POULTRY. 

Meats should be preferred wben of a good fatness 
and when the lean appears juicy, but not particularly 
streaked with fat, as in this case it frequently eats 
hard. When the season will permit, let it hang for 
a week, in which time it will arrive at its best state. 
Poultry, likewise, should be chosen tolerably &t 
and of a soft g^in. Let them hang three or four 
days, which will improve their flavour : but wood- 
cocks, snipes, larks, and sucking-pigs, should be 
dressed fresh. Be particular that the poultry are 
trussed very neatly. 

DIRECTIONS FOR POULTRY, &C. PLAIN BOILED. 

Turkies, chickens, and meats, intended to be 
plain boiled, should be soaked in cold water, and 
afiterwards put into plenty of boiling pump water, 
kept skimmed, and preserved as white as possible. 
The time they will take dressing may be learned 
by a little practice. Be particular in trimming 
the meats neatly, and in trussing the poultry. The 
carving, which is frequently expressed by the phrase 
of cutting into pieces^ should likewise be carefully 
attended to. 



POULTRY) OAME, &C. 47 

DIRECTIONS FOB ROASTING. 

Observe that in roasting a good quick fire is re- 
quired, but not too strong, and the meats should 
be well-jointed, neatly trimmed, and covered with 
paper, to preserve them from being of too high a 
colour. Beef and mutton should not be done too 
much ; veal, pork, and lamb, should be done well ; 
and some little time before serving, take the paper 
off, sprinkle the meat with salt, and when of a 
proper colour, froth it with butter and flour. Large 
poultry may be papered and done in the same 
manner; but small poultry, such as chickens, wood- 
cocks, rabbits, wild fowls, &c. will not require 
papering. The time the several articles will take 
roasting must be ascertained by practice, as the 
weather and the different strengths of fires make a 
material alteration. Entrees may be served with 
small ornaments of puff-paste, or croutons of fried 
bread round them. 

TURKIES. 

To be roasted with a stuffing in the breast, and 
served with bread sauce in a boat. 

TURKEY WITH TRUFFLES.

and put the truffle sauce round the turkey. 

Pullets, chickens, pheasants, or partridges, may 
be done in the same manner. 

TURKEY WITH CHESTNl/TS. 

Truss the turkey as for boiling, stuff it with 
light forcemeat and peeled Spanish chestnuts whole, 
and paper and roast it as a turkey with truffles. 
When it is to be served, glaze the breast and put 
chestnut sauce to it, made with good cullis and 
chestnuts, which should be boiled till half done, and 
then roasted in a frying-pan till wholly done ; after 
which let them be peeled and put into the cullis 
five minutes before serving the turkey. 

TURKEY WITH RAGOUT. 

Stuff it in the plain way, boil it, and when it is

Bone either a shoulder of lamb or a fowl, and 
season the inside with pepper, salt, and a little 
beaten spice ; then put into it some light forcemeat, 
sew it up, blanch, and braise it in broth. When 
done, lay it on a dish with the breast downward to 
preserve it as white as possible ; and when the jelly 
in the mould is quite stiff, work on it a sprig or 
star with small slips of ham, pickled cucumber, 
breast of fowl, and white and yellow omelets of 
egg; then set it with a little jelly, and when cold 
put the meat or poultry upon it, and fill the mould

MEATS. 119 

FRIED TRIPE AND ONIONS. 

Cut the tripe into slips of four inches long and 
three inches wide, dip them in batter and fry them 
in boiling lard. On serving, put under it slices of 
onions cut one inch thick, and fry them in the same 
manner. Or instead of slips of tripe, pieces of 
cow-heel may be used ; and let melted butter be 
sent in a sauce-boat with a little mustard in it, and, 
if approved, a table spoonful of vinegar. 

BOILED TRIPE AND ONIONS. 

Cut a prepared double of tripe into slips, then peel 
and boil some Spanish, or other onions, in milk and 
water with a little salt, and when they are nearly 
done, add the tripe, and boil it gently twenty 
minutes. Serve with the onions and a little of the 
liquor in a tureen. Serve, likewise, in a sauce- 
boat, some melted butter with a little mustard, and, 
if approved, a table spoonful of vinegar mixed 
with it. 

TRIPE AND ONIONS {another way). 

Put the pieces of tripe into a pan with milk 
sufficient to cover them; bake till tender, and 
serve in a bowl with onion sauce in a butter-

SAUCES, FARCES, &c. 

'OBSERVATIONS ON FISH SAUCES, &C. 

Let it be particularly observed that fish sauces 
should be of the thickness of light batter, so that 
they may adhere to the fish when dressed; it being 
a frequent error that they are either too thick or 
too thin. The thickening should be made with the 
best white flour sifted, and butter passed over a 
fire for some time, or some water mixed with a 
wooden spoon or a whisk. A little of it is recom- 
mended to be always ready where there is mucb 
cooking, as it is frequently wanted both in fisb and 
other sauces. 

There are, likewise, other articles repeatedly 
wanted for stove-work ; and as their possession has 
been found to obviate much inconvenience and 
trouble, it may be well to enumerate them: 
colouring liquid preserved in a bottle, strained 
lemon juice preserved in the same manner, 
Cayenne pepper, ground spices^ ground pepper 
and salt mixed, which should be preserved sepa-^ 
rately in small jars ; and every day, when wanted, 

6 



122 ART OF COOKERY. 

fresh bread crumbs should be rubbed through a hair- 
sieve; parsley, thyme, shalots, savory, marjoram 
scalded and chopped fine, and lemon-peel chopped 
very /fine and put on a <&sh, in separate partitions. 

Few directions are given for serving the fish 
sauces with any particular kind of fish, — spch as 
lobster sauce for turbot or salmon, &c.; it is 
therefore recommended that every person make a 
choice, and be not biassed altogether by custom. 

All white sauces, when added to the ingredients, 
should be set in a pot of boiling water over a fire 
to be made hot. 

GREEN SAUCE FOR DUCKLINGS, OR GREEN GEESE. 

Pick green spinach or sorrel, wash, and bruise it 
in a mortar, and strain the liquor through a tamis 
cloth. To a gill of the juice add a little loaf sugar, 
the yolk of a raw egg, and a spoonful of vinegar ; 
if spinach juice, put one ounce of fresh butter, and 
whisk all together over a fire till it begins to boil. 

Should the sauce be made of spinach juice, two 
table spoonsful of the pulp of gooseberries, rubbed 
through a hair sieve, may be added instead of 
the vinegar. 

FENNEL SAUCE FOR MACKAREL, EITHER BOILED, 

OR BROILED. 

Pick a little green fennel, mint, and parsley, 



SAUCES, &c. 12S 

wash, boil them till tender, drain and press them, 
chop them fine, add melted butter, and serve imme- 
diately; for should the herbs be mixed with the 
butter any length of time before serving, they will 
be discoloured. The same observation should be 
attended to in making parsley and butter sauce. 

If approved, some pulp of green gooseberries 
rubbed through a hair-sieve, and a little sifted sugar, 
may be added. 

SWEET SAUCE FOR BOAST MUTTON, OR VENlSON« 

Add to a gill of Port wine two table spoonsful of 
vinegar, half a gill of cullis, some sugar and onion 
bailed, and rubbed through a sieve, and a little 
pounded cinnamon; make it boiling just before 
serving. 

APPLE SAUCE FOR PORK, GEESE, &C. 

Pare, quarter, and core, baking apples ; put them 
into a stewpan, add a bit of lemon rind, a small 
stick of cinnamon, a few cloves, and a small quan- 
tity of water. Cover the pan close, set it over 
a moderate fire, and when the apples are tender 
take the peel and spices out ; add a bit of fresh 
butter, and sugar.

for five minutes, and pour it over the hare boiling 
hot. 

MUSHROOM SAUCE FOR FOWI.S, &C. 

Peel a pottle of fresh gathered forced mushrooms, 
wash them clean, and put them into a stewpan with 
two ounces of fresh bntter, a little salt, and the 
juice of half a lemon. Cover the stewpan, and set 
it on a moderate fire for ten minutes. When the 
liquor is extracted, make it of a proper thickness 
with flour and water, season with Cayenne pepper, 
and colour it with a little soy. 

BREAD SAUCE. 

Rub some bread crumbs through a colander, and 
setting them in a stewpan, add some cream or milk, 
a little salt, and ground white pepper, an onion 
boiled till tender and chopped fine, and a bit of 
fresh butter. Boil all together for five minutes. 

If any white meat of a dressed fowl is at hand, 
pound it fine, rub it through a hair-sieve with a 
little milk, and add it to the sauce. 



SAUCES, &c. 125 

BREAD SAUCE FOR TURKIES, GAME, &C. 

Soak a piece of crumb of bread in half a pint 
of milk or cream, add a middling-sized peeled 
onion, boiled till tender, and put them over a fire ; 
when the milk is absorbed bruise the bread, and 
mix with it two ounces of fresh butter, a little white 
pepper, and salt. 

MAYONNAISE SAUCE. 

Mix with a wooden spoon the yolks of six eggs 
boiled hard, a spoonful of sweet oil, and a dessert 
spoonful of Tarragon vinegar. When it begins to 
thicken, add two spoonsful of aspic of jelly, or be- 
chamel, and a little salt. When it again begins to 
thicken, add a spoonful of oil, and half a spoonful 
of vinegar. Serve it of a good consistence. 

This sauce may be served over a cold salad of 
lobsters, soles, sa&non, or other fish. 

MAYONNAISE SAUCE A LA RAVIGOTTE. 

Take some chervil, tarragon, burnet, and chives ; 
wash and pick a handful of each, and boil them in 
salt and water for six or eight minutes. Then put 
them into cold water, strain, pound them in a

not adhere to the pan when turned out. Wipe 
the pan very clean and dry ; put into it two ounces 
of fresh butter, and when hot put in the mixture 
of eggs : then stu- with a wooden spoon till it be-

The best common vinegar should, in genieral^ hei 
used for pickling, boiled in a well-cleaned copper 
or brass preserving pRu, but not sufiered to remain 
in the pRn Rfter it boils. The numerous Rrts piRc- 
tised to preserve the ingredients green are useless 
if the vegetRbles Rre gatliered fresh> on a dry day^ 
when in season, and the processes followed thajt 
are recommended.

quantity of vinegar to cover the cabbage, together 
with a moderate quantity of bruised black pepper, 
mace, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and mus- 
tard-seed. Strain the vinegar and ingredients, and 
let them stand till cold, then add a little bruised 
cochineal ; drain the cabbage on a large sieve till 
dry, and put the whole into jars down close : or the 
liquor may be poured over the cabbage boiling, 
and when cold, add a little bruised cochineal before

plenty of whole ginger and black pepper, a mid- 
dling quantity of mace, allspice and cloves, some 
slices of horseradish, peeled onions, shalots, and a 
small quantity of garlic. Let the ingredients boil 
for ten minutes, and pour them with the liquor 
over the gerkins, cover the jars with cabbage 
leaves and a plate, and set them in a warm place. 
Drain the liquor from them tke next day, boU it, 
and pour over them again ; and if on the iMtA day 
they are not green enough, boil the vinegar again, 
and pour it over them; or boil them for three 
minutes in the vinegar, and when cold tie bladder 
and white leather over the jars, and set t&eot in a 
dry place. 

In the same manner may be done walnuts, love- 
apples, berberries, capsicums, French beans, nas- 
turtimns, and small pickling melons peeled very

cBento with half a pound of fresh batter, set in ice 
to cool, and, if not sufficiently green,^ add a little 
spinach juice. 

TO PRESERVE BUTTER. 

Mix well together two parts of best common 
salt, one of saltpetre, and one of sifted sugar ; add 
one ounce of this CQQ^>osition to every pound 6f 
butter, put into a pan or tub, cover close, set in a 
cool dry place, and let it remain for three weeks. 

TO CLARIFY BUTTER FOR POTTING. 

Put fresh butter into a stewpan with a spoonful 
of cold water, set over a gentle fire till oiled, skim 
and let it stand' till the sediment is settled ; then 
pour off the oil, and, when it begins to congeal, 
put it over the different ingredients. 

OBSERVATION ON STORIES. 

As frequent nientibB is made of syrups, jams, 
poaadad spices, sifited sugsir, grated nutmegs and 
orange flower water, to be used in paddings and 
pies; and as a very small quantity of each is 
wanted at a time; it is recommended as sonng

b^tbtronble and expense, diat the syrups, &c. be 
made when the fruits are in season, and preserved 
in smali bottles with the different stores. Bdt 
should any of the receipts be thought tbo expensive 
or rich^ the proportions of the articles mecy be 
lessened, but the same process must be pursued* 
The same observation will ap^ly to made dishes, 
pastry, sauces, &c. 



VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 

PYRAMID OF PASTE. 

. Roll a ^eet of puff paste half an inch thick, 
cut or stamp it into oval forms, the first to be the 
size of the bottom of the dish in which it is to be 
served, the second smaller, and so on till it be- 
comes a pyramid ; then put each piece separately 
on paper laid in a baking plate, and when the oven 
is ready, e^ the tops of the pieces and bake of a 
l^rht colour. When done take them off the paper, 
lay them on a large dish till quite cold, and when 
t0 be served set the largest piece in the dish for 
which it was shaped, cover it widi raspberry, or 
apricot jams, or currant jelly, put the next sized 



VARIOUS B£C£JPTS« S85 

piece on (bis with more sweetmeatS} and procecdift 
the same manner till sH the pieces are plaeed on 
each other. Lay dried fruits round the pyramid^ 
aa greengages, barberries, or cherries. 

Instead of stamping the pieces it may be better 
to cut them with a sharp knife^ and then to cut out 
small pieces round the edges, so as to make them 
appear like spires : prepared in this manner, the 
paste appears lighter. A silver-coloured carmel of 
sugar may be spun over the pyramid, and will add 
to its effect. 

PYRAMID OF PASTE (another way). 

Proceed as above directed, but when baked and 
cold, wash over each piece of paste with white of 
egg beaten to a solid froth, and strew over chopped 
almonds and sifted sugar ; set in a moderately warm 
place to dry,, and then pile into a pyramid with dif- 
ferent sweetmeats on each. 

A HERMITAGE OF PASTE. 

Make a paste with four ounces of flour, a little 
sugar and some boiling water; knead well, roll 
into pieces, and form into three or four arches of 
different sizes, with some straight pieces for sup* 
porters ; bake on tin plates. Have ready some very 
small fruit pu£k made with puff paste, baked of a 
light colour, and some pieces of rock sugar of dtf* 



286 AST OB COOKERY. 

fi^rent celovs ; thmi dip ike ends of the pieces of 
paste iolo wana earmel sugar^ set tliem upright in 
a dish in any ft»rm you choose for the hermitage^ 
and fill the cavities with the puffs and pieces of 
rode sugtur which are to be joined with the ewoael. 
Put a litde clean moss upon the rock sugar which 
covers the top^ as it will have a good effect. When 
the heroutage is complete,, ^in a earmel ov«r the 
whole^ and set ia a dry place. 

• 

ALMOND PASTE FOR ORNAMENTING* 

Scald, and pound finely a pound of Jordan 
almonds with a little water to prevent their oiling; 
add three quarters of a pound of sifted sugar, set 
OB a slow fire^ and stir with a woodm spoon till the 
aiixture s^pears white and dry ; tilien pou&d again 
with a little OumTragaoanth stoained through linen; 
add stay perfume preferred^ and pireserve in a pot 
covered with a damp clotL 

If formed in a mould, roll the paste very thin 
for shapes, and oil the mould. 

TO PREPARE SUGAR FOR A CARMEL, OR BASKET. 

First deffree.-^T0 every pound of sifted sugar 
add half a pint of water, with the qvarter of an 
egg beaten i^ with it ; boil three times^ skim^ and 
strain through a eloth strainer. Boil agsdn^ and 
when dipping your forefinger into tl^e syrup, it

thread, wUch breaks before extended to imy di»^ 
tance: this constitutes the first boUing, and is 
termed the thread* 

Setcnd degree.-^-^^oW again, when tiie diread will 
stretch without breaking : this is termed a J9^ar/. 

Third degree.'^Tio% take up some of the syrup 
in a small skimmer, shake it into the holes, and blow 
through them ; if sparks or bubbles appear, this is 
termed a blow. 

Fourth degree. — Boil, repeat as for the third 
degree, and if the bubbles are lai^er, and ittore 
adherent, they become feathers. 

Itfih degree. — Dip your finger into cold water^ 
llien into the sytup, and again into the wateii^ : the 
sugar will roll into large or small boBi. 

Sixth degree. — Repeat the last process; if the sugar 
on rolling, breaks with a slight noise, this is called 
a crack. 

Seventh or last £fcyf«f .— Wheti Ht a eraek^ add five 
or sht drops of lemon juice, to prevent the BtigtO' 
from graining ; boil, and then set the pan in cM 
water. This is the carmeL 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR, OR CARMEL. 

Put two quarts of water with fo<ur poiuads of loaf 
sugar into a preserving pan, set over a fire, and 
add, when warm, the whites of three eggs beat up 



288 ART OF COOKERY. 

with half a pint of water; when the syrup boils 
skim it clean, and simmer till perfectly clear. 

To clarify sugar for carmel requires but a small 
quantity of water; and the different degrees of 
strength will be learnt by practice. It is generally 
thrown over a mould, rubbed with sweet oil; and 
strewed over cakes, with a fork dipped in it 

FLOWERS IN SUGAR. 

Clarify sugar to a carmel height (which may be 
known by dipping in a fork, when the sugar should 
draw out as fine as thread) and put in the flowers. 
Have ready teacups with the insides rubbed with 
sweet oil : put into each cup four table spoonsful of 
the sugar and flowers, and when cold turn them out 
of the cups, and serve piled on each other. 

TO MAKE WAX BASKETS. 

Take one pound of white wax, half a ppund of 
spermaceti, an ounce of flake white, and half an 
ounce of hog's lard : mix together over a fire, oil 
the basket mould with a clean cloth, let the wax be 
of a moderate heat, and run it entirely round the 
inside ; when cool take it out of the mould and 
garnish with flowers of fat or coloured gum paste, 
or paint landscapes, &c. 



YAHIOUS RECEIPTS. 289 

TO CLARIFY ISINGLASS. 

To a quarter of a pound of melted isinglass add 
the tenth part of the white of an egg beaten up 
with a pint of water; boil over a moderate fire, 
skim it clean, and run through a silk sieve. 

ICEING FOR TARTS. 

Wash the top of the tart with a small quantity of 
yolk of egg and oiled butter mixed together, and 
sift sugar over, just before setting in the oven. 

ICEING FOR A CAKE. 

Whisk the whites of four eggs to a solid froth, 
with as much treble refined sifted sugar as it will 
take up; then add the juice of a lemon, and. a grain 
of ambergris ; mix all well together with a spoon, 
and spread it over the cake when warm. 

TO MAKE RED COLOURING FOR PIPPIN PASTE, &C. 
OR FOR GARNISHING TWELFTH CAKES. 

Boil for twenty minutes an ounce of cochineal 
beaten very fine, three gills of water, a quarter of 
an ounce of roche-alum, and two ounces of lump 
sugar; strain through a fine sieve, and preserve 
for use closely covered. 

GUM PASTE FOR ORNAMENTING CAKES, &C. 

Dissolve Gum Dragon with water, strain and 



290 ART OP COOKERY. 

pound it for half an hour in a mortar with a little 
sifted sugar ; add some hair powder, and pound it 
again a quarter of an hour. It may be made of any 
colour by adding cochineal, gamboge, &c., and 
formed in moulds of any shape. 

TO CHOOSE COCHINEAL. 

It shoijdd be large, clean, heavy, dry, and of a 
silvery shining white, but, when broken, of a dark 
red. 

TO PREPARE COCHINEAL. 

Boil a pint of soft ley of wood ashes, strained 
through a flannel bag, with an ounce of pounded 
cochineal, and add a quarter of a pound of pounded 
alum, and a quarter of an ounce of powdered cream 
of tartar : boil till of a good dark colour, add a little 
sifted sugar, and preserve in a closely corked bottle. 

COLOURS FOR GARNISHING. 

Red. — Mix the liquor of prepared cochineal with 
a little alum and water, strain through a tamis- 
cloth, and add to some gum paste. Cut into any 
shapes chosen. 

Yellow. — Rub through a tamis-cloth the yolks of 
four hard eggs with some water, and a little saffron; 
add to gum paste. 



VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 291 

Green. — Pound spinach, boiled in salt and water 
till three parts done, strain the liquor to gum paste, 
and mix well together. 

A PERFUME FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. 

Beat well together in a mortar ambergris, white 
sugar-candy, musk, and civet, six grains each, and 
then bottle the powder with four ounces of the best 
rectified spirits of wine : set in a warm place for a 
week, strain clear, and put by closely corked in a 
dry place. 

Five or six drops will be sufficient for a middling 
sized cake, or for a quart of cream. 

YORKSHIR*^ CAKES FOR BREAKFAST. 

Set a sponge with a little good yeast, and, when 
well risen, half a pound of sifted fiour with a little 
salt, a tea-spoonful of sifted sugar, a bit of fresh 
butter, and some milk ; mould well with the hands, 
form into middling sized cakes, and set them in a 
warm place. Bake, and when done, serve them 
buttered; or they may be toasted, and then buttered. 

POTATOE BALLS.
