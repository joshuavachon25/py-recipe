THE title of this work will, in a slight degree, indicate its purpose ; still, in 
presenting it to the public, we would offer a few remarks as to our plan. 

In accordance with our design, we have placed before our readers a popular 
and entertaining account of thousands of objects which are familiar to them 
111 every-day life, but of which, from their very familiarity, they have never 
inquired. How are they made ? Who invented them ? Or what matters of 
interest are there connected with them ? 

We are fully impressed with the belief that there are many persons, and 
even educated ones, who, although they will not take the trouble to search for 
and collect the information necessary to form a proper estimate of the value 
and importance of our more familiar things, would, if it were brought before 
them without trouble, feel gratified and surprised at the fund of knowledge 
and amusement they offer. This we have done. 

If there be any among our readers, who, having turned over the pages of 
" INQUIRE WITHIN," have hastily pronounced them to be confused and ill 
arranged, let them at once refer to THE INDEX, or forever hold their peace. 

THE INDEX is, to the vast congregation of useful hints and receipts that fill 
the boundary of this volume, like the DIRECTORY to the great aggregation of 
houses and people in New York. 

! No one, being a stranger to New York, would run about asking for " Mr. 
SMITH." But, remembering the Christian name, and the profession of the 
individual wanted, would turn to the DIRECTORY, and trace him out. 

Like a house, every paragraph in "INQUIRE WITHIN," has its number, 
and the INDEX is the DIRECTORY which will explain what Facts, Hints, and 
Instructions inhabit that number. 

For, if it be not a misnomer, we are prompted to say that " INQUIRE 
WITHIN" is peopled with thousands of ladies and gentlemen, who have 
approved of the plan of the work, and contributed something to its store of 
useful information. There they are, waiting to be questioned, and ready to 
reply. Only a short time ago, the facts and information, now assuming, the 
conventional forms of printing-types, were active thoughts in the minds of 
many people. Their fingers traced those thoughts upon the page, for the 
benefit of whomsoever might need information. We must not separate the 
thought from the mind which gave it birth ; we must not look upon these 
writings as we should upon the traces left by the snail upon the geeu leaf, 
having neither form nor meaning. Behind each page some one lives to answer 
for the correctness of the information imparted, just as certainly as where 
in the window of a dwelling, you see a paper directing you to " INQUIRE 
WITHIN " some one is there to answer you. 



l\ PREFACE. 

A DOCTOR lives at 906 ; a GARDENER at 1021 ; a SCHOOLMASTER at 132? 
a DANCING MASTER at 1678 ; an ARTIST at 1851 ; a NATURALIST at 1925 
a MODELLER at 1931; a COOK at 1972; a PHILANTHROPIST at 2006; a 
LAWYER at 2047; a SURGEON at 2186; a CHESS PLAYER at 2354; a 
CHEMIST at 2387 ; a BREWER at 2559 ; and so on. 

Well ! there they live always at home knock at their doors IXQUIRB 
WITHIN NO FEES TO PAY ! ! 

We have taken so much care in selecting our information, and have been 
aided by so many kind friends in the production of our volume, that we canno 
turn to any page without at once being reminded of the GENEROUS FRIEND 

WHO ABIDES THERE. 

" INQUIRE WITHIN " is decidedly the most wonderful and useful book that 
bas been issued for many years. It should be in the hands of every family in 
tbe country, as it gives a vast amount of information on every subject con- 
nected with domestic life, not heretofore in print in any other work. As a 
book of reference it is invaluable, it refers to and explains everything, 
whether you wish to model a flower in wax to ornament a vase by the art of 
potichomanie ; to serve up a relish for breakfast or for supper; to supply a 
delicious entree for the dinner table ; to plan a dinner for a large party or a 
small one ; to cure a head-ache ; to get married ; to establish acquaintances 
according to the rules of etiquette; to play at cards, chess or other games; to 
enjoy an hour at curious puzzles and arithmetical questions; to tie any kind 
of a knot; to do up a neat parcel; to relieve the invalid ; to write and speak 
correctly; to acquaint yourself with the technical terms in literature, law and 
medicine: whether you want to dance; to commence and end a courtship, or 
whatever you may wish to do, make, or to enjoy, provided your desire has 
relation to the necessities of domestic life all you have to do is to procure 
a copy of INQUIRE WITHIN, and it will give all the information you want 
to know.

INQUIBE WITHIN 



UPON 



EVEEYTHING. 



1 CHOICE OF ARTICLES OF 
FO3D. Nothing is more important 
in tkie affairs of housekeeping than the 
choice of wholesome food. We have 
been amused by a conundrum which is 
as follows: ''A man went to market 
and bought two fish. When he reached 
home he found they were the same as 
when he had bought them ; yet there 
were three! 1 ' How was this? The 
answer is " He bought two mackerel, 
and one smelt /" Those who envy him 
his bargain need not care about the 
following rules ; but to others they 
will be valuable : 

2. MACKEREL 'must be perfectly 
fresh, or it is a very indifferent fish; it 
will neither bear carriage, nor being 
kept many hours out of the water. 
The firmness of the flesh and the 
clearness of the eyes, must be the 
criterion of fresh mackerel, as they are 
of all other fish. (See 65.) 

3. FLOUNDERS, and all flat white 
fish, are rigid and firm when fresh; 
the under side should be of a rich 
sream colour. When out of season, 
or too long kept, this becomes a bluish 
white, and the flesh soft and flaccid. 
A clear, bright eye in fish, is also a 
mark of being fresh and good. 

4. COD is known to be fresh by the 
rigidity of the muscles (or flesh) ; the 
redness of the gills, and clearness of the 
yes. Crimping much improve! this fish. 



5. SALMON. The flavour and ex 
cellence of this fish depends upon its 
freshness, and the shortness of time 
since it was caught ; for no method can 
completely preserve the delicate flavour 
it has when just taken out of the water. 

6. HERRINGS can only be eaten 
when very fresh, and like mackerel, 
will not remain good many hours after 
they are caught. 

7. FRESH- WATER FISH. The re- 
marks as to firmness and clear, fresh 
eyes, apply to this variety of fish, of 
which there are pike, perch, &c. 

8. LOBSTERS, recently caught, have 
always some remains of muscular ac 
tion in the claws, which may be excit- 
ed by pressing the eyes with the linger, 
when this cannot be produced, the lob- 
ster must have been too loag kept. 
When boiled, the tail preserves its 
elasticity if fresh, but loses it as soon 
as it becomes stale. The heaviest lob- 
sters are the best; when light, they 
are watery and poor. Hen lobsters 
may generally be known by the spawn, 
or by the breadth of the " flap." 

9. CRABS must be chosen by obser 
vations similar to those given above in 
the choice of lobsters. Crabs have an 
agreeable smell when fresh. 

10. PRAWNS AND SHRIMPS, when 
fresh, are firm and crisp. 

11. OYSTERS. If fresh, the shell i* 
i firmly closed ; when the shells of 07* 

(M) 



32 BREATH MAT BLOW OUT A CANDLK, AN EXTINGUISHER PREVENT A FIRE. 



ters are opened, they are dead, and 
unfit for food. The small-shelled oys- 
ters are the finest in flavour. Larger 
kinds, called rock oystefs, are general 
ly considered only fit for stewing and 
sauces, though some persons prefer 
them. 

12. BEEF. The grain of ox beef, 
when good, is loose, the meat r ed, and 
the fat inclinghg to yellow. Cow 
beef, on the contrary, has a closer 
grain, a whiter fat, but meai scarcely 
as red as that of ox beef. Inferior 
beef, which is meat obtained from ill- 
fed animals, or from those which had 
become too old for food, may be known 
by a hard skinny fat, a dark red lean, 
and, in old animals, a line of horny 
texture running through the meat of 
the ribs. When meat pressed by the 
finger rises up quickly, it may be con- 
sidered as that of an animal which was 
in its prime ; when the dent made by 
pressure returns slowly, or remains 
visible, the animal had probably past 
its prime, and the meat consequently 
must be of inferior quality. 

1 3. VEAL should be delicately white, 
though it is often juicy and well fla- 
voured when rather dark in colour. 
Butchers, it is said, bleed calves pur- 
posely before killing them, with a view 
to make the flesh white, but this also 
makes it dry and flavourless. On ex 
amining the loin, if the fat enveloping 
the kidney be white and firm-looking, 
the meat will probably be prime and 
recently killed. Veal will not keep so 
long as an older meat, especially in hot 
or damp weather ; when going, the fat 
becomes soft and moist, the meat flabby 
and spotted, and somewhat porous, like 
eponge. Large, overgrown veal, is in- 
ferior to small, delicate, yet fat veal. 
The fillet of a cow-calf is known by the 
udder attached to it, and by the soft- 
ness of the skin ; it is preferable to the 
real of a bull-calf. 

14. MUTTON. The meat should be 
ftrm and close in grain, and red in 
colour, the fat white and nrm. Mutto: 
Is in its prime when the sheep is aboul 
five years old, though it is often killed 



much younger. If too young, the flesh 
feels tender when pinched ; if too old, 
on being pinched it wrinkles up, and 
so remains. In young mutton, the fat 
readily separates ; in old, it is held 
together by strings of skin. In sheep 
diseased of the rot, the flesh is very 
pale-coloured, the fat inclining to yel- 
low, the meat appears loose from the 
bone, and, if squeezed, drops of watei 
ooze out from the grains ; after cooking 
the meat drops clean away from the 
bones. Wether mutton is preferred 
to that of the ewe ; it may be known 
by the lump of fat on the inside of the 
thigh. 

15. LAMB. This meat will not keep 
long after it is killed. The large vein 
in the neck is bluish in colour when 
the fore quarter is fresh, green when 
becoming stale In the hind- quarter, 
if not recently killed, the fat of the 
kidney will have a slight smell, and the 
knuckle will have lost its firmness. 

16. PORK. When good, the rind is 
thin, smooth, and cool to the touch; 
when changing, from being too long 
killed, it becomes flaccid and clammy. 
Enlarged glands, called kernels, in the 
fat, are marks of an ill-fed or diseased 

pig- 

17. BACON should have a thin rind, 
and the fat should be firm and tinged 
red by the curing ; the flesh should be 
of a clear red, without intermixture of 
yellow, and it should firmly adhere to 
the bone. To judge the state of a ham, 
plunge a knife into it to the bone ; on 
drawing it back, if particles of meat 
adhere to it, or if the smell is disagree- 
able, the curing has not been effectual, 
and the ham is not good ; it should, in 
such a state, be immediately cooked. 
In buying a ham, a short, thick one, is 
to be preferred to one long and thin. 

18. VENISON When good, the fat 
is clear, bright, and of considerable 
thickness. To know when it is neces- 
sary to cook it, a knife must be plunged 
into the haunch ; and from the smell 
the cook must determine on dressing 
or keeping it. 

19. TURKEY. In choosing poultry 



A SOOTY CHIMNEY COSTS MANY A BEEF STEAK. 



the age of the bird is tbo chief point to 
be attended to An old turkey has 
rough and reddish legs; a young one 
smooth and black. Freeh killed, the 
eyes are full and clear, and the feet 
moist. When it has been kept too 
long, the parts about the vent begin to 
wear a greenish, discoloured appearance. 

20. COMMON DOMESTIC FOWLS, 
when yonng, have the legs and combs 
smooth; when old, they are rough, and 
on the breast long hairs are found in- 
stead of feathers. Fowls and chickens 
ehould be plump on the breast, fat 
on the back, and white legged. 

21. GEESE. The bills and feet are 
red when old, yellow when young. 
Fresh killed, the feet are pliable, stiff 
when too long kept. Geese are called 
green while they ftve only two or three 
months old. 

22. DUCKS. Choose them with sup- 

Sle feet and*hard, plump breasts. Tame 
ucks have yellow feet, wild ones red. 

23. PIGEONS are very indifferent 
food when they are too long kept. Sup 
pleness of the feet show them to be 
young ; the state of the flesh is flaccid 
when they are getting bad from keep- 
ing. Tame pigeons are larger than the 
wild. 

24. RABBITS, when old, have the 
haunches thick, the ears dry and tough, 
and the claws blunt and ragged. A 
young hare has claws smooth and sharp, 
ears that easily tear, and a narrow 
cleft in the lip. A leveret is distin- 
guished from a nare by a knob or small 
bone near the foot. 

25. PARTRIDGES, when young, have 
yellow legs and dark-coloured bills. 
Old partridges are very indifferent eat- 
ing 

20. WOODCOCKS AND SNIPES, when 
old, have the feet thick and hard ; when 
these are soft and tender, they are 
both your.g and fresh killed. When 
their bills become moist, and their 
throats muddy, they have b?en too long 
killed . ( See FOOD IN SEASON, 48 to f9 .) 

27. TO CLEAN BLACK CLOTH 
CLOTHES. Clean the puments 
wel' then boil four ounces oflogwood 



in a boiler or copper containing two or 
three gallons of water, for half an hour. 
Dip the clothes in warm water, and 
squeeze dry ; then put them into the 
copper and boil for half an hour. Take 
them out, and add three drachms of 
sulphate of iron ; boil for half an hour, 
then take them our, and hang them up 
for an hour or two ; take them down, 
rinse them in three cold waters, dry 
well and rub with a soft brush which 
has had a few drops of olive oil rubbed 
on its surface. If the clothes are 
threadbare about the elbows, cuffs, &c., 
raise the nap with a teazel or half 
worn hatter's card, filled with flocks, 
and when sufficiently raised, lay the 
nap the right way with a hard brush. 
We have 'seen our old coats come out 
with a wonderful dash of respectability 
after this operation. 

28. PREVENTION OF FIRES. 
The following simple suggestions are 
worthy of observation : Add one ounce 
of alum to the last water used to rinse 
children's dresses, and they will be 
rendered uninflammable, or so slightly 
combustible that they would take fire 
very slowly, if at all, and would not 
flame. This is a simple precaution, 
which may be adopted in families of 
children. Bed curtains, and linen in 
general, may also be treated in the 
same way. 

29. CAMPHOR BALLS TO PRE- 
VENT CHAPS Melt three drachms 
of spermaceti, four drachms of white 
wax, with one ounce of almond oil, 
and stir in three drachms of camphor 
(previously powdered by moistening it 
with a little spirits of wine) ; pour 
small quantities into small gallipots, 
so as to turn out in the form of cakes. 

30. CASTOR OIL POMADE. 
Castor oil, four ounces ; prepared lard, 
two ounces ; white wax, two drachms ; 
bergamot, two drachms ; oil of laven- 
den, twenty drops. Melt the fat to- 
gether, and on cooling, add the scents, 
and stir till cold. 

31. MUTTON PIE. The follow- 
ing is a capital family dish: Cut mut- 
t^u into pieces about two inches square. 



84 



A CRACKED TLATE WILL LAST AS LONG AS A SOUND ONE. 



and half an inch thick; mix pepper, 
pounded allspice, and salt together; 
dip the pieces in this ; sprinkle stale 
bread crumbs at the bottoir of the dish ; 
lay in the pieces, strewing the crumbs 
over each layer ; put a piece of butter 
the size of a hen's egg at the top ; add 
H wineglassful of water, and cover in, 
and bake in a moderate oven rather 
better than an hour. Take an onion, 
chop fine ; a faggot of herbs ; and add 
to it a little beef stock, or gravy ; sim- 
mer for a quarter of an hour; raise 
the crust at one end, and pour in the 
liquor not the thick part. (See 135.) 

32. MOTHS (to get rid of them). 
1. Procure shavings of cedar- wood, 
and enclose in muslin bags, which 
should be distributed freely among the 
clothes. 2. Procure shavings of cam- 
phor-wood, and enclose in bags. 3. 
Sprinkle pimento (allspice) berries 
among the clothes 4. Sprinkle the 
clothes with the seeds of the musk 
plant. 5. To destroy the eggs when 
deposited in woollen cloth, &c., use a 
solution of acetate of potash in spirits 
of rosemary, fifteen grains to the pint. 

33. PAINS IN THE HEAD AND 
FACE. A friend assures us that he 
was cured of a severe attack of tic 
doloreux by the following simple rem- 
edy : Take half a pint of rose water, 
add two teaspoonfuls of white vinegar, 
to form a lotion. Apply it to the part 
affected three or four times a day. It 
requires fresh linen and lotion each ap- 
plication ; this will, in two or three 
days, gradually take the pain away. 
The above receipt I feel desirous of 
being made known to the public, as I 
have before mentioned the relief I have 
experienced, and others, whose names 
I could give. The last remark is our 
friend's own. We doubt the cure of 
real tic doloreux by these means ; but 
in many cases of nervous pains the 
above would be useful, and may easily 
be triea. 

34. COLD CEEAM. No. 1. Oil of 
almonds, one pound ; white wax, four 
ounces. Melt together gently in an 
earthen vessel, and when nearly cold, 



stir in gradually twelve ounces of rose- 
water. No. 2. White wax and sper 
maceti, of each half an ounce ; oil of 
almonds, four ounces; orange flower 
water, two ounces. Mix as directed 
for No. 1. 

35. NIGHT LIGHTS. Field's and 
Child's night lights are generally known 
and are easily obtainable. But under 
circumstances where they cannot be 
procured, the waste of candles may be 
thus applied : Make a fine cotton, and 
wax it with white wax. Then cut 
into the requisite lengths. Melt the 
grease, and pour into pill boxes, pre- 
viously either fixing the cotton in the 
centre, or dropping it in just before the 
grease sets. If a little white wax be 
melted with the grease, all the better. 
In this manner, the ends and drippings 
of candles may be used up. When set 
to burn, place in a saucer, with suffi. 
cient water to rise to the extent of the 
16th of an inch around the base of the 
night light. 

36. GINGER CAKES. To two 
pounds of flour add three-quarters of a 
pound of good moist sugar, one ounce 
best Jamaica ginger well mixed in the 
floiir; have ready three-quarters of a 
pound of lard, melted, and four eggs 
well beaten; mix the lard and eggs 
together, and stir into the flour, which 
will form a paste ; roll out in thin 
cakes, and bake in a moderately-heated 
oven. Lemon biscuits may be made 
the same way, by substituting essence 
of lemon instead of ginger. 

37. THE HANDS. Take a wine- 
glassful of eau de Cologne, and another 
of lemon-juice : then scrape two cakes 
of brown Windsor soap to a powder, 
and mix well in a mould. When hard, 
it will be an excellent soap for whiten- 
ing the hands. 

38. To WHITEN THE NAILS. Di- 
luted sulphuric acid, two drachms- 
tincture of myrrh, one drachm ; spring 
water, four ounces ; mix. First cleanse 
with white soap, and then dip the fin 
gers into the mixture. A good hand is 
one of the chief points of beauty; and 
these applications are really effective- 



BETTER PAY THE COOK THAN THE DOCTOR. 



35 



39. RHUBARB TO PRESERVE. 

Peel one pound of the finest rhubarb, 
and cut it into pieces of two inches in 
length, and three-quarters of a pound 
of white sugar, and the rind and juice 
of one lemon the rind to be cut into 
narrow strips. Put all into a preserv- 
ing kettle, and simmer gently until the 
rhubarb is quite soft, take it out care- 
fully with a silver spoon r and put it into 
iars: then boil the syrup a sufficient 
bine to make it keep well, say one 
hour, and pour it over the fruit. When 
cold put a paper soaked in brandy over 
it, and tie the jars down with a blad- 
der to exclude the air. This is a very 
good receipt, and should be taken ad- 
vantage of in the spring. 

40. HALF -PAY PUDDING. An 
officer's wife is the contributor of the 
following : Four ounces of each of the 
following ingredients, viz., suet, flour, 
currants, raisins, and bread crumbs; 
two tablespoonfuls of treacle, half a pint 
of milk all of which must be well 
mixed together, and boiled in a mould, 
for four hours. To be served up with 
wine or brandy sauce, if half-pay per- 
mit. From two to three hours we 
find sufficient ; it is an excellent sub-

41. DR. KITCHENER'S RULES 
FOR MARKETING. The best rule 
for marketing is to pay ready money 
for everything, and to deal with the most 
respectable tradesmen in your neigh- 
bourhood. If you leave it to their in- 
tegrity to supply you with a good arti- 
cle, at the fair market price, you will 
be supplied with better provisions, and 
at as reasonable a rate as those bargain- 
hunters, who trot " around, around, 
around about" a market till they are 
trapped to buy some unchewable old 
poultry, tough tup-mutton, stringy cow- 
beef, or stale fish, at a very little less 
than the price of prime and proper food. 
"With savings like these they toddle 
home in triumph, cackling all the way, 
like a goose that has got ancle -deep 
into good luck. All the skill of the 
most accompMshed cc-rk will avail no- 



thing unless she is furnished with prime 
provisions. The best way to procure 
these is to deal with shops of establish- 
ed character : you may appear to pay, 
perhaps, ten per cent, "more than you 
would were you to deal with those who 
pretend to sell cheap, but you would 
be much more than in that proportion 
better served. Every trade has its 
tricks and deceptions; those who fol- 
low them can deceive you if they please, 
and they are too apt to do so, if you 
provoke the exercise of their over- 
reaching talent. Challenge them to a 
game at "Catch who can," by entirely 
relying on your own judgment, and you 
will soon find nothing but very long 
experience can make you equal to the 
combat of marketing to the utmost ad- 
vantage. If you think a tradesman 
has imposed upon you, never use a 
second word, if the first will not do 
nor drop the least hint of an imposi- 
tion ; the only method to induce him 
to make an abatement is the hope of 
future favours, pay the demand, and 
deal with the gentleman no more ; but 
do not let him see that you are dis- 
pleased, or as eoon as you are out of 
sight your reputation will suffer as 
much as your pocket has. Before you 
go to market, look over your larder, 
and consider well what things are 
wanting especially on a Saturday. 
No well-regulated family can suffer a 
disorderly caterer to be jumping in and 
out to make purchases on a Sunday 
morning. You will be enabled to man- 
age much better if you will make out 
a bill of fare for the week on the Satur- 
day before ; for example, for a family 
of half a dozen 

Sunday Roast beef and pudding. 
Monday Fowl, what was left of pud 

fried, or wanned in the Dutch oven. 
Tuesday Calf* head, apple pie. 
Wednesday Leg of mutton. 
Thursday Do. broiled or hashed, or 

cakes. 

Friday Fish, pudding. 
Saturday Fish, or eggs and bacon. 

[t is an excellent plan to have certain 
things on certain days. When your 
:utcher and poulterer knows what you 



36 



DISEASE IS S30N SHAKEN BY PHYSIC SOON TAKEN. 



will want, he has a better chance of 
doing his beet for you ; and never think 
of ordering beef for roasting except for 
Sunday. When you order meat, poul- 
try, or fish, tell the tradesman when 
you intend to dress it: he will then 
have it in his power to serve you with 
provision that will do him credit, which 
the finest meat, &c., in the world will 
never do, unless it has been kept & 
proper time to be ripe and tender. 

42. CLEANING SILKS, SATINS, 
COLOURED WOOLEN DRESSES, 
&c. Four ounces of soft soap, four 
ounces of honey, the white of an egg, 
and a wine-glassful of gin; mix well 
together, and the article to be scoured 
with a rather hard brush thoroughly, 
afterwards rinse it hi cold water, leave 
to drain, and iron whilst quite damp. 
A friend informs us that she believes 
this receipt has never been made pub- 
lic ; she finds it an excellent one, hav- 
ing used it for a length of time, and 
recommended it to friends with perfect 
success. 

43. SPONGE CAKE. A lady, or, 
as the newspapers say, a " correspond- 
ent upon whom we can confidently 
rely," favours us with the following 
simple receipt, which, she says, gives 
less trouble than any other, and has 
never been known to fail : Take five 
eggs, and half a pound of loaf-sugar 
sifted ; break the eggs upon the svigar, 
and beat all together with a steel fork 
for half an hour. Previously take the 
weight of two eggs and a-half in their 
shells, of flour. After you have beaten 
the eggs and sugar the time specified, 
grate in the rind of a lemon (the juice 
may be added at pleasure), stir in the 
flour, and immediately pour it into a 
tin lined with buttered paper, and let it 
be instantly put into rather a cool oven. 

44. BED CLOTHES. The perfec- 
tion of dress, for day or night, where 
warmth is the purpose, is that which 
confines around the body sufficient of 
its own warmth, while it allows escape 
to the exhalations of the skin. Where ' 
the body is allowed to bathe protract- 
edly in its own vapours we must expect 



an unhealthy effect upon the skin. 
Where there is too little ventilating 
escape, insensible perspiration is check 
ed, and something analogous to fever 
supervenes ; foul tongue, ill taste, and 
lack of morning appetite betray the 
evil. 

45. ORANGE MARMALADE. 
Choose the largest Seville oranges, as 
they usually contain the greatest quan- 
tity of juice, and choose them with clear 
skins, as the skins f orm the largest part 
of the marmalade. Weigh the oranges, 
and weigh also an equal quantity of 
loaf-sugar. Skin the oranges, dividing 
the skins into quarters, and put them 
into a preserving-pan ; cover them well 
with water, and set them on the fire to 
boil : in the meantime prepare youi 
oranges ; divide them into gores, then 
scrape with a teaspoon all the pulp 
from the white skin ; or, instead of 
skinning the oranges, cut a hole in the 
orange and scoop out the pulp ; remove 
carefully all the pips, of which there 
are innumerable small ones in the Se- 
ville orange, which will escape observ- 
ation unless they are very minutely ex- 
amined. Have a large basin near you 
with some cold water in it, to throw 
the pips and skins into a pint is suffi- 
cient for a dozen oranges. A great 
deal of glutinous matter adheres to 
them, which, when strained through a 
sieve, should be boiled with the other 
parts. When the skins have boiled 
till they are sufficiently tender to ad- 
mit of a fork being stuck into them, 
strain them; some of which may be 
boiled with the other parts ; scrape 
clean all the pith, or inside, from them ; 
lay them in folds, and cut them into 
thin slices of about an inch long. Clari- 
fy your sugar ; then throw your skins 
and pulp into it, stir it well, and let it 
boil about half an hour. If the sugar 
is broken into small pieces, and boiled 
with the fruit, it will answer the pur- 
pose of clarifying, but it must be well 
skimmed when it boils. Marmalade 
should be made at the end of March 
or the beginning of April, as Sevill* 
o ^nges are then in their bost state. 



ECONOMY IS THE EASY CHAIR OF OLD AGE. 



46. IMPRESSIONS FROM 
PRINTS. The print is soaked first 
in a solution of potash, and then in one 
of tartaric acid. This produces a per- 
fect diffusion of crystals in bi-tartrate 
of potash, through the texture of the 
imprinted part of the paper. As this 
gait repels the oil, the ink-roller may 
now be passed over the surface, with- 
out transferring any of its contents to 
the paper, except in those parts to 
which the ink had been originally ap- 

Slied. The ink of the print prevents 
tie saline matter from penetrating 
wherever it is present, and wherever 
there is no saline matter present the 
ink adheres ; so that many impressions 
may be taken, as in lithography. 

47. HOOPING-COUGH. Dissolve 
a scruple of salt of tartar in a quarter 
pint of water ; add to it ten grains of 
cochineal ; sweeten it with sugar. Give 
to an infant a fourth part of a table- 
spoonful four times a day ; two years 
old half a spoonful ; from four years a 
tablespoonful. Great care is required 
in the administration of medicines to 
infants. We can assure pa-tenral in- 
quirers that the foregoing may be de- 
pended upon. 

FOOD IN SEASON. 
There is an old maxim, " A place for 
everything, and every thing in its place." 
To which we beg to add another, " A 
season for everything, and everything 
in season."

60. TO SOFTEN THE SKIN, 
AND IMPROVE THE COMPLEX- 
ION If flowers of sulphur be mixed 
in a little of milk, and after standing an 
hour or two, the milk (without disturb- 
ing Ihe sulphur) be rubbed into the 
*!< ; n ifc will keep it fMt, wit] make the 



complexion clear. It is to be used be- 
fore washing. A lady of our acquaint- 
ance, being exceedingly anxious about 
her complexion, adopted the above 
suggestion. In about a fortnight she 
wrote to us to say that the mixture be- 
came so disagreeable after it had been 
made a few days, that she could not 
use it. We should have wondered if 
she could the milk became putrid ! 
A little of the mixture should have 
been prepared over night with evening 
milk, and used the next morning, but 
not afterwai'ds. About a wineglassful 
made for each occasion would suffice. 

61. HINTS ABOUT MAKING 
PRESERVES. It is not generally 
known, that boiling fruit a long time, 
and skimming it well, without the sugar, 
and without a cover to the preserving 1 - 
pan, is a very economical and excellent 
way economical, because the bulk of 
the scum rises from the fruit, and not 
>om the sugar, if the latter is good ; 
and boiling it without a cover, allows 
:he evaporation of all the watery par- 
;icles therefrom ; the preserves keep 
irm, and weH flavoured. The propor- 
;ions are, three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. Jam made in 
;his way, of currants, strawberries, rasp- 
>erries, or gooseberries, is excellent. 

Gvi. LEMON RICE. Boil sufficient 
rice in milk, with white sugar to taste, 
ill it is soft ; put it into a pint basin 
>r an earthenware blancmange mould, 
and leave it till cold. Peel a lemon 
ery thick, cut the peel into shreds 
ibout half or three-quarters of an inch 
n length, put them into a little water, 
xril them up, and throw the water 
nvaj lest ifc should be bitter, then pour 
ibout a tea-cup full of fresh water 
upon them ; squeeze and strain the 
juice of the lemon, add it, with white 
ugar, to the water and shreds, and let 
t stew gently at the fire for two hours. 
When cold it will be a syrup . ) Having 
urned out the jellied rice into a cut- 
lass dish, or one of common delf, 
our the syrup gradually over the rice, 
aking care the little shreds of the pel 
re equally distributed over the whoja.

WILFIL WASTE MAKES WOEEUL WANT. 



63. MOUTH GLUE. A very useful 
preparation is sold by many of the law 
stationers under this title ; it is nerely 
a thin cake of soluble glue (four inches 
by one and a half), which, when moist- 
ened with the tongue, furnishes a ready 
means of fastening papers, &c , together. 
It is made by dissolving one pound of 
fine glue, or gelatine, in water, and 
adding half a pound of brown sugar, 
boiling the whole until it is sufficiently 
thick to become solid on cooling ; it is 
then poured into moulds, or on a slab 
slightly greased, and cut into the re- 
quired shape when cool. (See 66.) 

64. SODA WATER POWDERS. 
A pleasant, cooling, summer drink. 
The blue paper contains carbonate of 
soda, thirty grains ; the white paper 
tartaric acid, twenty-five grains. 

Directions. Dissolve the contents 
of the blue paper in half a tumbler of 
water, stir in the other powder, and 
drink during effervescence. 

Soda powders furnish a saline bever- 
age, which is very slightly laxative, 
and w r ell calculated to allay the thirst 
in hot weather. 

One pound of carbonate of soda, and 
thirteen ounces and a half of tartaric 
acid, supply the materials for 256 pow- 
ders of each sort. 

65. METHOD OF PRESERVING 
MACKEREL, SO THAT IT WILL 
KEEP AND BE EXCELLENT FOR 
MONTHS. Mackerel, being at cer- 
tain times exceedingly plentiful (espe- 
cially to those who live near the coast), 
eo much so indeed as to become almost 
a drug &t such seasons, may be pre 
served to make an excellent and well- 
flavoured dish, weeks or months after 
the season is past, by the following 
means: Having chosen fine fish, cleaned 
them perfectly, and either boiled them 
or lightly fried them in oil, the fish 
should be divided, and the bones, 
heads, and skins being removed, they 
should then be well rubbed over with 
the following seasoning: For every 
dozen good-sized fish, it will be requi- 
site to use three table -spocnfuls of salt 
''heaped) one mnce and ft half of com- 



mon black pepper, six or eight cloves, 
and a little mace, finely powdered, and 
as r:ueh nutmeg, grated, as the oper- 
ator chooses to afford, not, however 
exceeding one nutmeg. Let the whole 
surface be well covered with the sea- 
soning; then lay the fish in layers, 
packed into a stone jar (not a glazed 
one) ; cover the whole with pretty 
good vinegar, and, if it be intended to be 
long kept, pour salad oil or melted 
suet over the top. N. B. The glazing 
on earthen jars is made from lead or 
arsenic, from which vinegar draws 
forth poison. (See 2.) 

66. LIQUID GLUE. Dissolve one 
ounce ^ borax in a pint of boiling wa- 
ter; adi two ounces of shellac, and 
boil in a covered vessel until the lac is 
dissolved. This forms a very useful 
and cheap cement ; it answers well for 
pasting labels on tin, and withstands 
damp much better than the common 
glue. The liquid glue made by dissolv- 
ing shellac in naptha is dearer, soon 
dries up, and has an unpleasant smell 
(See 63.) 

67. ROSE LIP SALVE. No. 1. 
Oil of almonds, three ounces ; alkanet, 
half an ounce. Let them stand to- 
gether in a warm place until the oil is 
coloured, then strain. Melt one ounce 
and a half of white-wax, and half an 
ounce of spermaceti with the oil, stir 
till it begins to thicken, and add twelve 
drops of otto of roses. No. 2. White 
wax, one ounce ; almond oil, two 
ounces ; alkanet, one drachm. Digest 
in a warm place till sufficiently colour- 
ed, strain, and stir in six drops of otto 
of roses. 

68. WALKING. To walk grace- 
fully, the body must be erect, but not 
stiff, and the head held up in such a 
posture that the eyes are directed for- 
ward. The tendency of untaught walk- 
ers is to look towards the ground near 
the feet ; and some persons appear al- 
ways as if admiring their shoe-ties. The 
eyes should not thus be cast downward, 
neither should the chest bend forward 
to throw out the back, making what 
Are termed round shoulders; on the 



WHAT IS DONE WELL ENOUGH, iS DONE QUICK ENOUGH. 



4J 



contrary, the whole person must hold 
Itself up, as if not afraid to look the 
world in the face, and the chestf by all 
means be allowed to expand. At the 
game time, everything like strutting 
or pomposity must be carefully avoid- 
ed. An easy, firm, and erect posture, 
are alone desirable. In walking, it is 
necessary to bear in mind that the 
locomotion is to be performed entirely 
by the legs. Awkward persons rock 
from side to side, helping forward each 
leg alternately by advancing the 
haunches. This is not only ungrace- 
ful, but fatiguing. Let the legs alone 
advance, bearing up the body. 

69. LEMON AND KALI, OR 
SHERBET. Large quantities of this 
wholesome and refreshing preparation 
are manufactured and consumed every 
summer ; it is sold in bottles, and also 
as a beverage, made by dissolving a 
large tea-spoonful in a tumbler two- 
thirds filled with water. Ground white 
sugar, half a pound; tartaric acid, car- 
bonate of soda, of each a quarter of a 
pound ; essence of lemon, forty drops. 
All the powders should be well dried ; 
add the essence to the sugar, then the 
other powders; stir all together, and 
mix by passing twice through a hair 
sieve. Must be kept in tightly-corked 
bottles, into which a damp spoon must 
not be inserted. All the materials may 
be obtained at a wholesale druggist's. 
The sugar must be ground, as, if mere- 
ly powdered, the coarser parts remain 
undissolved. 

70. WATERPROOFING FOR 
BOOTS AND SHOES. Linseed oil, 
one pint ; oil of turpentine, or cam- 
phine, a quarter of a pint ; yellow wax, 
a quarter of a pound ; Burgundy pitch, 
a quarter of a pound. To be melted 
together with a gentle heat, and when 
required for use, to be warmed and 
well rubbed into the leather before a 
fire, or in the hot sun. Should be 
poured, when melted, into small galli- 
pots or tin boxes, for sale. 

71. MY WIFE'S LITTLE TEA 

PARTIES. 
My wife is celebrated for her little 



tea parties ; not tea parties alone but 
dinner parties, pic nic parties, music 
parties, supper parties in fact, she is 
the life and soul of ALL PARTIES, which 
is more than any leading politician of 
the day can boast. But her great forte 
is her little tea parties praised and 
enjoyed by everybody. A constant 
visitor at these little parties is Mrs. 
Hitchings (spoken of elsewhere, 27 1 J\ 
and she remarks that she " never knew 
any one who understood the /tart of 
bringing so many Aelegauces together ' 
as my wife. Nobody makes tea like 
her, and how she makes it she will im- 
part at a future time. But for her lit- 
tle " nick-nacks," as she calls them, 
which give a variety and a charm to 
the tea table, without trenching too 
deeply upon our own pocket, she has 
been kind enough to give a few re- 
ceipts upon the present occasion. 

72. NICE PLUM CAKE. One pound 
of flour, quarter of a pound of butter, 
quarter of a pound of sugar, quarter of 
a pound of currants, three eggs, half a 
pint of milk, and a small tea-spoonful 
of carbonate of suda. The above is 
excellent. The cakes are always 
baked in a common earthen flower-pot 
saucer, which is a very good plan. 

73. GINGERBREAD SNAPS. One 
pound of flour, half a pound of treacle, 
half a pound of sugar, quarter of a 
pound of butter, half an ounce of best 
prepared ginger, sixteen drops of 
essence of lemon, potash the size of a 
nut, dissolved in a table-spoonful of hot 
water. This has been used in my 
wife's family for thirty years. 

74. DROP CAKES. One pint of 
flour, half a pound of butter, quarter 
of a pound of pounded lump sugar 
half a nutmeg grated, a handful of cur- 
rants, two eggs, and a large pinch of 
carbonate of soda, or volatile salta 
To be baked in a slack oven for ten 
minutes or a quarter of an hour. The 
above quantity will make about thirty 
cakes. The cakes are excellent. 

75. A VERY EXCELLENT AND CHEAF 

CAKE. Two pounds and a half of 
flour, three quarters of a pound of w

gar, three-quarters of a pound of but- 
ter, half a pound of currants, or quarter 
of a pound of raisins, quarter of a pound 
of orange peel, two ounces of carraway 
seeds, half an ounce of ground cinna- 
mon, or ginger, four tea- spoonfuls of 
carbonate of soda ; mixed well, with 
rather better than a pint of new milk. 
The butter must be well melted previ- 
ous to being mixed with the ingredients. 

76. "JERSEY WONDERS.'' The 
cddity of these "wonders" consists 
solely in the manner of cooking, and 
the shape consequent. Take two 
pounds of flour, six ounces of butter, 
six ounces of white sugar, a little nut- 
meg, ground ginger, and lemon peel ; 
beat eight eggs, and knead them all 
well together ; a taste of brandy will 
be an improvement. Roll them about 
the thickness of your w 7 rist ; cut oft' a 
small slice, and roll it into an oval, 
about four inches long and three inches 
Tvide, not too thin; cut tw T o slits in it, 
but not through either end ; there will 
then be three bands. Pass the left 
one through the aperture, to the right, 
and throw it into a brass or bell-metal 
skillet of BOILING lard, or beef or mut- 
ton dripping. You may cook three or 
four at a time. In about two minutes 
turn them with a fork, and you will 
find them browned, and swollen or 
risen in two or three minutes more. 
Remove them from the pan to a dish, 
when they will dry arid cool. 

77. MUFFINS. Add a pint and a 
naif of good ale yeast (from pale malt, 
if possible) to a bushel of the very best 
white flour ; let the yeast lie all night 
in water, then pour off the water quite 
clear ; make two gallons of water just 
milk warm, and mix your water, yeast, 
and two ounces of salt well together 
for about a quarter of an hour. Strain 
the whole, and mix up your dough as 
light as possible, letting it lie in the 
trough an hour, to rise ; next roll it 
with your hand, pulling it into little 
pieces about the size of a large walnut. 
These must be rolled out thin with a 
rolling-pin, in a good deal of flour, and 
If covered immediately with a piece of 



flannel, they will rise to a proper thick- 
ness; but if too large or Hiuall, dough 
must be added accordingly, or taken 
away; meanwhile, the dough must be 
also covered with flannel. Next begin 
baking ; and when laid on the iron 
watch carefully, and when one (side 
changes colour, turn the other, taking 
care that they do not burn or become 
discoloured. Be careful also that the 
iron does not get too hot. In order to 
bake muffins properly, you ought to 
have a place built as if a copper w r as 
to be set ; but instead of copper, a piece 
of iron must be put over the top, fixed 
in form like the bottom of an iron pot, 
underneath which a coal fire is kindled 
when required. Toast the muffins crisp 
on b':th sides with a fork; pull them 
0|- it with your hand, and they will be 
like a honeycomb ; lay in as much but- 
ter as you intend, then clap them to- 
gether, and set by the fire ; turn them 
once, that both sides may be buttered 
alike. When quite done, cut them 
across with a knife ; but if you use a 
knife either to spread or divide them, 
they will be as heavy as lead. Some 
kind of flour will soak up more water 
than another; when this occurs, add 
water; or if too moist, add flour: for 
the dough must be as light as possible. 

78. DIAMOND CEMENT. Soak 
isinglass in water^till it is soft, then 
dissolve it in the smallest possible quan- 
tity of proof spirit, by the aid of a gentle 
heat; in two ounces of this mixture 
dissolve ten grains of ammoniacum, 
and whilst still liquid, add half a drachm 
of mastic dissolved in three drachms 
of rectified spirit ; stir well together, and 
put into small bottles for sale. (See 139.) 

Directions for use. Liquify the ce- 
ment by standing the bottle in hot wa- 
ter, and use it directly. The cement 
improves the oftener the bottle is thus 
warmed, and resists the action of water 
and moisture perfectly. 

79. GINGER-BEER, The follow- 
ing recipe for making a very superioi 
ginger-beer is taken from the cele- 
brated treatise of Dr. Pereira, on diet 
The honey gives it a peculiar softness 



EVERY MAN IS THE ARCHITECT OP HIS OWN FORTUNE.

and from not being fermented with 
yeast, it is less violent iu its action 
when opened, but requires to be kept 
a longer time than usual before use. 
White sugar, five pounds; lemon-juice, 
one quarter of a pint ; honey, one 
quarter of a pound ; ginger, bruised, 
live ounces ; water, four gallons and a 
half. Boil the ginger iu three quarts 
of the water for half an hour, then add 
the sugar, lemon-juice, and honey, with 
the remainder of the water, and strain 
through a cloth ; when cold, add a 
quarter of the white of an egg, and a 
small tea-spoonful of essence of lemon; 
let the whole stand four days, and bot- 
tle ; this will keep many months. This 
quantity will make 100 bottles. 
80. PHOSPHORUS PAST." 



DESTROYING RATS AND MiUE. 

Melt one pound of lard with a very 
gentle heat in a bottle or glass flask 
plunged into warm water ; then add 
half an ounce of phosphorus, and one 
pint of proof spirit; cork the bottle 
securely, and as it cools shake it fre- 
quently, so as to mix the phosphorus 
uniformly ; when cold pour off the 
spirit (which may be preserved for the 
same purpose), and thicken the mix- 
ture with flour. Small portions of this 
mixture may be placed neur the rat 
holes, and being luminous in the dark, 
it attracts them, is eaten greedily, and 
is certainly fatal. N. B. There is no 
danger of fire from its use. 

81. INKS. There are many reci- 
pes published for making- ink ; the fol- 
lowing is as useful and economical a 
mode of producing good ink as any of 
them : 

82. DR. URE'S!NK. For twelve gal- 
lons of ink take twelve pounds of 
bruised galls, five pounds of gum, five 
pounds of green sulphate of iron, and 
twelve gallons of rain water. Boil the 
galls with nine gallons of the water for 
three hours, adding fresh water to sup- 
ply that lost in vapour ; let the decoc- 
tion settle, and draw off the cl^ar 
liquor. Add to it the gum previously 
dissolved in one and a-half gallons of 



rately in one and a half- gallons of water, 
and mix the whole. 

84. INK POWDER. Is formed of 
the dry ingredients for ink, powdered 
and mixed. Powdered galls, two 



pounds 
pound 



powdered green vitriol, one 
powdered gum, eight ounces. 



This should be put up into two ounce 
packets, each of which will make one 
pint of ink. 

84. RED WRITING INK. Best 
ground Brazil wood, four ounces 



diluted acetic 
half an ounce. 



acid, one pint; alum, 
Boil them slowly in an 



enamelled vessel for one hour ; strain, 
and add an ounce of gum. 

85. MARKING-INK WITHOUT PRE- 
PARATION. There are several recipes 
for this ink, but the following of Mr. 
Redwood is rapidly superseding all the 
others : Dissolve, separately, one ounce 
of nitrate of silver, and one and a-half 
ounces of sub-carbonate soda (best 
washing soda) in distilled or rain wa- 
ter. Mix the solutions, and collect and 
wash the precipitate in a filter ; whilst 
still moist rub it up in a marble or 
wedge-wood mortar with three drachms 
of tartaric acid ; add two ounces of dis- 
tilled water, mix six drachms of white 
sugar, and ten drachms of powdered 
gum arable, half an ounce of archil and 
water to make up six ounces in measure. 

86. INK FOR ZINC GARDEN LA- 
BELS. Verdigris, one ounce ; sal am- 
moniac, one ounce; lamp black, half 
an ounce ; water, half a pint. Mix in 
an earthenware mortar, without using 
a metal spatula. Should be put up 
in small (one ounce) bottles for sale. 

Directions. To be shaken before 
use, and used with a clean quill pen, 
on bright, freshly-cleaned zinc. 

Note. Another kind of ink for zinc 
is also used, made of chloride of plati 
mini, five grains, dissolved in one ounce 
of distilled or rain water ; but he first, 
which is much less expensive, answers 
perfectly, if used as directed, on clean, 
bright zinc 

87. BRUNSWICK BLACK FOR 
VARNISHING GRATES. Melt four 

water; dissolve the green vitri* I sepv | pounds of common asphaltum, and add 



WHEfl FORTUNE SMILES SHE OFTEN DESIGNS THE MOST MISCHIEF. 



two pints of linseed oil and one gallon 
of oil of turpentine. This is usually put 
up in stoneware bottles for sale, and is 
used with a paint brush. If too thick, 
more turpentine may be add 3d. 

88. BANBURY CAKES. Rollout 
the paste about half an inch thick, and 
cut it into pieces, then roll again till 
each piece becomes twice the size ; put 
some Baribury meat in the middle of 
one side, fold the other over it, and 
pinch it up into a somewhat oval shape, 
flatten it with your hand at the top, 
letting the seam be quite at the bottom, 
rub the tops over with the white of an 
egg, laid on with a brush, and dust 
loaf-sugar over them. Bake in a mode- 
rate oven. The meat for this cake is 
made thus : Beat up a quarter of a 
pound of butter until it becomes in 
the state of cream, then mix with it 
half a pound of candied orange and 
lemon peel, cut fine, one pound of cur- 
rants, quarter of an ounce of ground 
cinnamon, and a quarter of an ounce of 
allspice ; mix all well together, and 
keep in a jar till wanted for use. 

89. RED CURRANT JELLY. 
With three parts of fine, ripe, red cur- 
rants, mix one of white currants ; put 
them into a clean preserving-pan, and 
stir them gently over a clear fire until 
the juice flows from them freely ; then 
turn them into a fine hair sieve, and let 
them drain well, but without pressure. 
Pass the juice through a folded muslin, 
or a jelly-bag; weigh it, and then boil 
it fast for a quarter of an hour ; add 
for each -pound, eight ounces of sugar, 
coarsely powdered ; stir this to it, off 
the fire, until it is dissolved ; give the 
jelly eight minutes more of quick boil- 



and of raspberries, with the same pro- 
portion of sugar and degree of boiling 
as mentioned in the foregoing receipt. 
90. INDICATIONS OF WHOLE 
SOME MUSHROOMS. Whenever 
a fungus is pleasant in flavour and 
odour it may be considered whole- 
some if, on the contrary, it have an 
offensive smell, a bitter, astringent, or 
styptic taste, or even if it leave an un- 
pleasant flavour in the mouth, it should 
not be considered fit for food. The 
colour, figure, and texture of these 
vegetables do not aflord any characters 
on which we can safely rely; yet it 
may be remarked that in colour the 
pure yellow, gold colour, bluish pale 
dark or lustre brown, wine red, or the 
violet, belong to many that are escu- 



lent ; 



ellow 



bright or blood-rod, and the greenish, 
belong to few but the poisonous. The 
safe kinds have most frequently a com- 
pact, brittle texture ; the flesh is white ; 
they grow more readily in open places, 
such as dry pastures and waste lands, 
than in places humid or shaded by wood. 
In general, those should be suspected 
which grow in caverns and subterra- 
nean passages, on animal matter under- 
going putrefaction, as well as those 
whose flesh is soft or watery. 

91. GUM ARABIC STARCH. 
Get two ounces of fine white gum 
arabic, and pound it to powder. Next 
put it into a pitcher, and pour on it a 
pint or more of boiling water (accord- 
ing to the degree of strength you de- 
sire), and then having covered it, let it 
set all night. In the morning, pour it 
carefully from the dregs into a clean 
bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. A 



ing, and pour it out. It will be firm, I tablespoouful of gum water stirred into 



and of excellent colour and flavour. 
Be sure to clear off the scum as it 
rises, both before and after the sugar is 



put n, 
clear.

Juice of red currants, three 



pounds; juice of white currants, one 
pound : fifteen minutes. Sugar, two 
pounds : eight minutes. An excellent 
jelly may be made with equal parts of 



a pint of starch that has been made in 
the usual manner, will give to lawns 
(either white or printed) a look of new- 
ness to which nothing else can resfoiv 
them after washing. It is also good 
(much diluted) for thin white muslin 
and bobbinet.

Seidlitz powders are usually put up iu 
the juice of red and of white currant* [two papers. The larger blue paper con.

tains tartarized soda ^also called Ro- 
chelle salt) two drachma, and carbonate 
of soda two scruples ; in practice it will 
bo found more convenient to inix the 
two materials in larger quantity by 
passing them twice through a sieve, 
and then divide the mixture either by 
weight or measure, than to make each 
powder separately. 

Directions for use. Dissolve the 
contents of blue paper in half a tumbler 
of cold water, stir in the other powder, 
and drink during effervescence. 

MY WIFE'S LITTLE SUPPERS. 

93. MEAT CAKES. Take any cold 
meat, game, or poultry (if under-done, 
all the better), mince it fine, with a 
little fat bacon or ham, or an anchovy ; 
season it with a little pepper and salt ; 
mix well, and make it into small cakes 
three inches long, half as wide, and 
half an inch thick : fry these a light 
brown, and serve them with good gravy, 
or put it into a mould, and boil or bake 
it. N. B. Bread - crumbs, hard yolks 
of eggs, onions, sweet herbs, savoury 
spices, zest, or curry-powder, or any of 
the forcemeats. 

94. OVSTER PATTIES. Roll out 
puff paste a quarter of an inch thick, cut 
it into squares with a knife, sheet eight 
or ten patty pans, put upon each a bit 
of bread the size of half a walnut; roll 
out another layer of paste of the same 
thickness, cut it as above, wet the edge 
of the bottom paste, and put on the top, 
pare them round to the pan, and notch 
them about a dozen times with the back 
of the knife, rub them lightly with yolk 
of egg, bake them in a hot oven about 
a quarter of an hour: when done, take 
a thin slice off the top, then with a 
Email knife, or spoon, take out the 
bread and th* inside paste, leaving the 
outside quite entire ; then parboil two 
dozen of large oysters, strain them from 
their liquor, -?vash, beard, and cut them 
into four, put them into a stew-pan 
with an ounce of butter rolled in flour, 
half a gill of good cream, a little grated 
lemon-peel, the oyster liquor, free from 
sediment, reduce'd by boiling to one- 



half, some cayenne pepper, salt, and a 
tea-spoonful of lemon-juice : stir it ove* 
a fire five minutes, and fill the patties 
(See 11.) 

95. LOBSTER PATTIES. Prepare 
the patties as in the last receipt. Take 
a hen lobster already boiled pick the 
meat from the tail and claws, and chop 
it fine ; put it into a stew-pan with a lit* 
tie of the inside spawn pounded in a mor 
tar till quite smooth, an ounce of fresh 
butter, half a gill of cream, and half a 
gill of veal consomme, cayenne pep- 
per, and salt, a tea-spoonful of essence 
of anchovy, the same of lemon-juice, 
and a table- spoonful of flour and water : 
stew it five minutes. (Sec 8.) 

96. EGG AND HAM PATTIES. Cut 
a slice of bread two inches thick, fronc 
the most solid part of a stale quartern 
loaf; have ready a tin round cutter 
two inches diameter, cut out four or five 
pieces, then take a cutter two sizes 
smaller, press it nearly through the 
larger pieces, then remove with a small 
knife the bread from the inner circle; 
have ready a large stew-pan full of 
boiling lard; fry them of a light brown 
colour, drain them dry with a clean 
cloth, and set them by till wanted: 
then take half a pound of lean ham, 
mince it small, add to it a gill of good 
brown sauce ; stir it over the fire a few 
minutes, and put a small quantity of 
cayenne pepper and lemon juice: fill 
the shapes with the mixture, and lay a 
poached egg upon each. 

97. VEAL AND HAM PATTIES. 
Chop about six ounces of ready-dressed 
lean veal, and three ounces of ham very 
small, put it into a stew-pan with an 
ounce of butter rolled in flour, half a 
gill of cream, half a gill of veal stock, a 
little grated nutmeg and lemon-peel, 
some cayenne pepper and salt, a spoon 
ful of essence of ham, and lemon-juico, 
and stir it over the fire some time, tak- 
ing care it does not burn. 

98. PUFF PASTE. To a pound and 
a quarter of sifted flour rub gently in 
with the hand half a pound of fresh but- 
ter; mix up with half a pint of spring 
water ; knead it well, and set it by fo*

HE WHO SERVES WELL. NEED NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK HIS WAGES. 



a quarter of an hour ; then roll it out 
thiu, lay on it in small pieces three- 
quarters of a pound more of butter, 
throw on it a little flour, double it up 
in folds, and roll it out thin three times, 
and set it by for about an hour in a cold 
vlace. Or, if a more substantial and 
savoury paste is desired, use the fol- 
lowing: 

99. PASTE FOR MEAT OR SAVOURY 
PIES. Sift two pounds of fine flour to 
one and a-halfof good salt butter, break 
it into small pieces, and wash it well in 
cold water; rub gently together the 
butter and flour, and mix it up with the 
yolks of three eggs, beat together with 
a spoon, and nearly a pint of spring 
water ; roll it out, and double it in folds 
three times, and it is ready. 

100. CHICKEN AND HAM PATTIES. 
Use the white meat from the breast 
of the chickens or fowls, and proceed 
as for veal and ham patties. 

101. PRIME BEEF SAUSAGES. 
Take a p^ound of lean beef, and half a 
pound ot suet, clean from the skin, 
chop it fine as for mince collop, then 
beat it well with a roller, or in a mar- 
ble mortar, till it is all well mixed and 
will stick together season highly with 
zest, if you have it, and salt, or any 
mixed spices you please, make it into 
flat round cakes, about an inch thick, 
and shaped with a cup or saucer, and 
fry them a light brown. They should 
be served up on boiled rice, as for 
curry; if for company, you may do 
them with eggs and bread crumbs ; but 
they a're quite as good without. Or 
they may be rolled in puff or pie paste, 
and baked. (See 98 and 99.) 

102. POTATO PUFFS. Take cold 
roast meat, either beef or mutton, or 
veal and ham, clear it from the gristle, 
cut it small, and season either with 
zest or pepper and salt, and cut pickles 
boil and mash some potatoes, and 
make them into a paste with one or 
two eggs, roll it out, with a dust of flour, 
cut it round with a saucer, put some of 
your seasoned meat on one half, and 
fold it over like a puff; pinck or nick 
t neatly round, and fry it a light 



brown. This is the most elegant 
method of preparing meat tLat has been 
dressed before. 

103. FRIED EGGS AND MINCED 
HAM OR BACON. Choose some very 
fine bacon streaked with a good deal 
of lean ; cut this into very thin slices, 
and afterwards into small square pieces ; 
throw them into a stew-pan, and set it 
over a gentle fire, that they may lose 
some of their fat. When as much as 
will freely come is thus melted from 
them, lay them on a warm dish. Put 
into a stew-pan a ladleful of melted 
bacon or lard ; set it on a stove ; put in 
about a dozen of the small pieces of 
bacon, then stoop the stew-pan and 
break in an egg. Manage this care- 
fully, and the egg will presently be 
done. It will be very round, and the 
little dice of bacon will stick to it all 
over, so that it will make a very pretty 
appearance. Take care the yolks do 
not harden ; when the egg is thus done, 
lay it carefully in a warm dish, and do 
the others. 

104. FISH CAKE. Take the meat 
from the bones of any kind of cold fish, 
which latter put with the head and fins 
into a stew-pan with a pint of water, a 
little salt, pepper, an onion, and a fag- 
got of sweet herbs to stew for gravy. 
Mince the meat, and mix it well with 
crumbs of bread and cold potatoes, 
equal parts, a little parsley and season- 
ing. Make into a cake with the white 
of an egg, or a little butter or milk ; 
;gg it over, and cover with bread 
srumbs, then fry a light brown. Pour 
;he gravy over, and stew gently for fif- 
;een minutes, stirring it carefully twice 
or thrice. Serve hot, and garnish with 
slices of lemon, or parsley. 

105. MARBLED GOOSE. The fol- 
owing, though scarcely pertaining to 
' My Wife's Little Suppers," is too de- 
icious a relish to be overlooked. It is 
suitable for larger supper parties, or as 

stock dish for families where visitors 
are frequent. It is also excellent for 
breakfast, or for pic-nics : Take a fine 
mellow ox-tongue out of pickle, cut off 
the root and horny part at the tip, w'p* 



BUSYBODIES NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. 



dry, and boil till it Is quite tender; 
then peel it, cut a deep slit in its whole 
length, and lay a fair proportion of the 
following mixture within it : Mace, 
half an ounce ; nutmeg, half an ounce ; 
cloves, half an ounce ; salt, two table- 
Bpoonfuls ; and twelve Spanish olives. 
The olives should be stoned, and all 
the ingredients well pounded and mixed 
together. Next take a barn-door fowl, 
and a good large goose, and bone 
them. Lay the tongue inside the fowl, 
rub the latter outside with the season- 
ing, and having ready some slices of 
ham divested of the rind, wrap them 
tightly round the fowl ; put these in- 
side the goose, with the remainder of 
the^seasoning, sew it up, and make all 
secure and natural shape with a piece 
of new linen and tape. Put it in an 
earthen pan or jar just large enough to 
hold it, with plenty of clarified butter, 
and bake it two hours and a-half in a 
slow oven ; then take it out, and when 
cold take out the goose and set it in a 
sieve ; take off the butter and hard 
fat, which put by the fire to melt, add- 
ing, if required, more clarified butter. 
Wash and wipe out the pan, put the 
bird again into it, and take care that it 
is well covered with the warm butter ; 
then tie the jar down with bladder and 
leather. It will keep thus for a long 
time. When wanted for the table, the 
jar should be placed in a tub of hot 
water so as melt the butter ; the goose 
then can be taken out, the cloth taken 
oft' it, and sent to table cold. 

106. OYSTER PIE. The following 
directions may be safely relied upon. 
Take a large dish, butter it, and spread 
a rich paste over the sides and round 
the edge, but not at the bottom. The 
oysters should be fresh, and as large 
and fine as possible. Drain off part of 
the liquor from the oysters. Put them 
into a pan, and season them with pep- 
per, salt and spice. Stir them well 
with the seasoning. Have ready the 
yolks of eggs, chopped fine, and the 
grated bread. Pour the oysters (with 
as much of their liquor as you please) 
into the dish that has the paste in it. 



Strew over them the chopped egg and 
grated bread. Roll out the lid of the 
pie, and put it on, crimping the edges 
handsomely. Take a small sheet of 
paste, cut it into a square, and roll it 
up. Cut it with a sharp knife into the 
form. of a double tulip. Make a slit in 
the centre of the upper crust, and stick 
the tulip in it. Cut out eight large 
leaves of paste, and lay them on the 
lid. Bake the pie in a quick oven. 

107. SALAD. This is a point of pro- 
ficiency which it is easy to attain with 
care. The main point is, to incorporate 
the several articles required for the 
sauce, and to serve up at table as fresh 
as possible. The herbs should be 
" morning gathered," and they will be 
much refreshed by laying an hour or 
two in spring water. Careful picking, 
and washing, and drying in a cloth, in 
the kitchen, are also very important, 
and the due proportion of each herb 
requires attention. The sauce may be 
thus prepared: Boil two eggs for ten 
or twelve minutes, and then pat them 
in cold water for a few minutes, so that 
the yolks may become quite cold and 
hard. Rub them through a coarse 
sieve with a wooden spoon, and mix 
them with a tablespoonful of water or 
cream and then add two tablespoonfuls 
of fine flask oil or melted butter; mix, 
and add by degrees a teaspoonful of 
salt, and the same quantity of mustard ; 
mix till smooth, when incorporate with 
the other ingredients about three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar ; then pour this 
sauce down the side of the salad-bowl, 
but do not stir up the salad till wanted 
to be eaten. Garnish the top of the 
salad with the white of the eggs, cut in 
slices ; or these may be arranged in - 
such manner as to be ornamental on 
the table. Some persons may fancy 
they are able to prepare a salad with- 
out previous instruction; but like every- 
thing else, a little knowledge in this 
case may not be thrown away. 

308. USE OF FRUIT. Instead of 
standing in any fear of a generous con- 
sumption of ripe fruits, we regard them 
as positively conducive to health. Th*

THINK OF EASE, BUT WORK ON. 



very maladies commonly assumed to 
have their origin in the free use of 
apples, peaches, cherries, melons, and 
wild berries, have been quite as preva- 
lent, if not equally destructive, in 
seasons of scarcity. There are so many 
erroneous notions entertained of the 
bad effects of fruits, that it is quite time 
a counteracting impression should be 
promulgated, having its foundation in 
common sense, and based on the com- 
mon observation of the intelligent. 
We have no patience in reading the 
endless rules to be observed in this 
particular department of physical com- 
fort. No one, we imagine, ever lived 
longer or freer from the paroxysms of 
disease, hy discarding the delicious 
fruits of the land in which he finds a 
home. On the contrary, they are 
necessary to the preservation of health, 
and are therefore caused to make their 
appearance at the very time when the 
condition of the body, operated upon 
by the deteriorating causes not always 
understood, requires their grateful, 
renovating influence. 

109. DAUGHTERS. Mothers, 
who wish not only to discharge well 
their own duties in the domestic circle, 
but to train up their daughters at a 
later day to make happy and comforta- 
ble firesides for their families, should 
watch well, and guard well, the notions 
wii.ch they imbibe and with which 
they grow up. There will be so many 
persons ready to fill their young heads 
with false and vain fancies, and there is 
BO much always afloat in society oppos- 
ed to duty and common sense, that if 
mothers do not watch well, they may 
contract ideas very fatal to their future 
happiness and usefulness, and hold them 
till they grow into habits of thought or 
feeling. A wise mother will have her 
eyes open, and be ready for every case. 
A few words of common, downright, 
respectable, practical sense, timely lit- 
tered by her, may be enough to coun- 
teract some foolish idea or belief put 
into her daughter's head by others, 
whilst, if it be left unchecked, it may 
take such possession of the mind that il 



cannot later be corrected. One main 
falsity abroad in this age is the notion, 
that women, unless compelled to it by 
absolute poverty, are out of place when 
engaged in domestic affairs. Now 
mothers should have n care lest theii 
daughters get hold of this conviction as 
regards tnemselves there is danger of 
it ; the fashion of the day endangers it, 
and the care that an affectionate family 
;ake to keep a girl, during the time of 
icr education, free from other occupa- 
:ions than those of her tasks or her re 
reations, also endangers it. It is possi 
ale that affection may err in pushing 
this care too far; for as education 
means a fitting for life, and as a wo- 
man's life is much connected with do- 
mestic and family a flairs, or ought to be 
so, if the indulgent consideration of 
parents abstains from all demands upon 
the young pupil of the school not con- 
nected with her books or her play, will 
she not naturally infer that the matters 
with which she is never asked to con- 
cern herself are, in fact, no concern to 
tier, and that any attention she ever 
may bestow on them is not a matter of 
simple duty, but of grace, or concession, 
or stooping, on her part ? Let mothers 
avoid such danger. If they would do 
so, they must bring up their daughters 
from the first with the idea that in this 
world it is required to give as well as 
to receive, to minister as well as to eu 
joy ; that every person is bound to be 
useful, practically, literally useful, in 
his own sphere, and that a woman's first 
sphere is the house, and its concerns 
and demands. Once really imbued with 
this belief, and taught to see how much 
the happiness of woman herself, as well 
as her family, depends on this part of 
her discharge of duty, and a young girl 
will usually be anxious to learn all that 
her mother is disposed to teach, and 
will be proud and happy to aid in any 
domestic occupations assigned to her 
which need never be made so heavy a 
to interfere with the peculiar duties of 
her age, or its peculiar delights. If a 
mother wishes to see her daughter be- 
come a good, happy, and rational \v& 



RICHES ARE BUT THE BAGGAGE OF FORTUNE. 



man, never let her admit of contempt 
for domestic occupations, or even suffer 
them to be deemed secondary. They 
may be varied in character by station, 
but they can never be secondary to a 
woman. 

HO. SERVANTS. There are fre- 
quont complaints that, in these days 
servants are bad, and apprentices are 
bad, and dependants and aiding hands 
generally are bad. It may be so. But 
if it is so , what is the inference ? In 
the working of the machine of society, 
class moves pretty much with class; 
that is, one class moves pretty much 
with its equals in the community 
(equals so far as social station is con- 
cerned), and apart from other classes, 
as much those below as those above 
itself; but there is one grand exception 
to this general rule, and that is, in the 
case of domestic servants. The same 
holds, though in less degree, with ap- 
prentices and assistant hands ; and in 
less degree only, because, in this last 
case, the difference of grade is slighter. 
Domestic servants and assistants in 
business and trade, come most closely 
and continually into contact with their 
employers ; they are about them from 
morning to night, see them in every 
phase of character, in every style of 
humour, in every act of life. How in- 
fluence will descend ! Conscientiousness 
is spread, not only by precept but by 
example, and, so to speak, by contagion 
it is spread more widely. Kindness is 
communicated in the same way. Virtue 
of every kind acts like an electric shock. 
Those in contact with its practice rs re- 
ceive the communication of it. The 
same with qualities and tempers that do 
no honour to our nature. If servants 
come to you bad, you may at least im- 
prove them; possibly almost change 
their nature. Hei*e follows, then, a 
recipe to that effect: Recipe for ob- 
taining good servants. Let them ob- 
serve in your conduct to others just 
the qualities and virtues that you would 
deaire they should possess and practice 
as respects you. Be uniformly kind 
and gentle. If you reprove, do so 



with reason and with temper. Be re- 
spectable, and you will be respected by 
him. Be kind and you will meet kind 
ness from them. Consider their inter 
ests, and they will consider yours. A 
friend in a servant is no contemptible 
thing. Be to every servant a friend; 
and heartless, indeed, will be the ser- 
vant who does not warm in love to 
you. 

111. How TO MAKE GOOD BUT- 
TER. Milk should never be set for 
butter in a dark, damp cellar as in the 
case with butter makers in this section 
as the cream is thereby moulded be- 
fore it has had time to rise, which gives 
the butter a mouldy taste. 

The milk is allowed to stand too long 
before being skimmed, which gives it a 
cheesy taste. 

The cream is kept too long before it 
is churned, after it is skimmed, which 
gives it the taste of the other two ; and 
also a sour taste. 

The butter should never be washed 
in water, because it takes away that 
beautiful aroma so essential in good 
butter. 

It should never be taken in a per- 
son's warm hands, as the heat melts a 
certain portion of the globules, which 
gives it an oily taste, and makes it be- 
come rancid very soon. 

The milk should be set in good clean 
tin or earthen pans, in a dry, open, airy 
and shady place, above ground, if pos- 
sible, although a cellar may be so built, 
and ventilated, as to answer the pur- 
pose. It should never be set over 
twenty-four hours in warm weather; 
and for a dairy of three cows or over, 
the cream should be churned every 
morning, and never be kept over forty 
eight hours, in warm weather ; in cold 
weather it may be kept longer. It 
should alwaya be about the same heat 
that the milk is when drawn from tho 
cow, and churned steadily, and I have 
never known it to fail of coming readily, 
(we use a cylinder churn ;) it is then 
taken from the chum with a wooden 
butter ladle, into a wooden tray, which 
has been well scalded and cooled in 



50 



WHO LOOKS NOT BEFORE FINDS H1MSKLF BEHIND. 



pure cold water ; the ealt is then work- 
ed in to suit the taste, which is easily 
done with a little practice, and the 
butter-milk well worked out ; it is then 
set away in a cool place for about 
twenty-four hours, when it is well 
worked over again, as long as milk or 
pickle can be worked out. Butter made 
in this way, and put in stone pots, and 
kept from 'the air, will keep for along 
time. 

112 BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 
To each pound of picked fruit, allow 
one gill of water ; set them on the fire 
in the preserving-pan to scald, but do 
not let them boil; bruise them well 
with a silver fork, or wooden beater, 
take them oif and squeeze them through 
a hair sieve ; and to every pint of juice 
allow a pound of loaf or raw sugar; 
boil it ten minutes. 

113. BREAD (CHEAP AND EX- 
CELLENT KIND). Simmer slowly, 
over a gentle fire, a pound of rice in 
three quarts of water, till the rice has 
become perfectly soft, and the water 
has either evaporated or imbibed by the 
rice: let it become cool, but not cold, 
and mix it completely with four pounds 
of flour ; add to it some salt, and about 
four tablespoonfuls of yeast. Knead 
it very thoroughly, for on this depends 
whether 0r not your good materials 
produce a superior article. Next let it 
rise well before the fire, make it up into 
loaves with a little of the flour which, 
for that purpose, you must reserve from 
your four pounds and bake it rather 
long. , This is an exceedingly good and 
cheap bread. 

114 ECONOMICAL AND NOURISH- 
ING BREAD. Suffer the miller to re- 
move from the flour only the coarse 
flake bran. Of this bran boil five or 
six pounds in four and a-half gallons of 
water; when the goodness is extracted 
from the bran, during which time the 
liquor will waste one-half or three-quar- 
ters of a gallon, strain it and let it cool. 
When it has cooled down to the temper- 
ature of new milk, mix it with fifty-six 
pounds of flour, and as much salt and 
yeast as would be used for other bread ; 



knead it exceedingly well ; let it rise 
before the fire, and bake it in email 
loaves: small loaves are preferable to 
large ones, because they take the heat 
more equally. There are two advan 
tages in making bread with bran water 
instead of plain water ; the one being 
that there is considerable nourishment 
in bran which is thus extracted and 
added to the bread, the other, that flour 
imbibes much more of bran water 
than it does of plain water ; so much 
more, as to give in the bread produced 
almost a fifth in weight more than the 
quantity of flour made up with plain 
water would have done. These are 
important considerations to the poor. 
Fifty-six pounds of flour, made with 
plain water, would produce sixty-nine 
and a-half pounds of bread ; made with 
bran water it will produce eighty-three 
and a-half pounds. 

115. SCOURING DROPS FOR 
REMOVING GREASE. There are 
several preparations of this name ; one 
of the best is made as follows: Cain- 
phene, or spirits of turpentine, three 
ounces ; essence of lemon, one ounce ; 
mix. 

116. POMATUMS.^For making 
pomatums, the lard, fat, suet, or mar- 
row used, must be carefully prepared 
by being melted with as gentle a heat 
as possible, skimmed, strained, and 
cleared from the dregs which are de- 
posited on standing. 

117. COMMON POMATUM. Mutton 
suet, prepared as above, one pound ; 
lard, three pounds ; carefully melted to- 
gether, and stirred constantly as it 
cools, two ounces of bergainot being 
added. 

118. HARD POMATUM. Lard and 
mutton suet carefully prepared, of each 
one pound ; white wax, four ounces ; es- 
sence of bergamot, one ounce. 

119. PICKLING EGGS. If the 
following pickle were generally known 
it would be more generally used. W 
constantly keep it in our family, and 
find it an excellent pickle to be eaten 
with cold meat, &c. The eggs should 
be boiled hard (say ten minutes), and 



THERE ARE NONE POOR BUT SUCH AS GOD DISOWNS. 



51 



then divested of their shells ; when 
quite cold put them in jars, and pour 
over them vinegar (sufficient to quite 
cover them), in which has been previ- 
ously boiled the usual spices for pick- 
ling ; tie the jars down tight with blad- 
der, and keep them till they begin to 
change colour. 

120. WHITE CURRANT JELLY. 
White currant jelly is made in the 
same way as red currant jelly, only it 
should have double-refined sugar, and 
Dot bo boiled above ten minutes. White 
currant jelly should be put through a 
lawn sieve! 

121. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR WHITE 
CURRANT JELLY. After the fruit is 
stripped from the stalks, put it into the 
pan, and when it boils run it quickly 
through a sieve : take a pound of sugar 
to each pint of juice, and let it boil 
twenty minutes. 

122. POTATOES. We are all po- 
iato eaters (for ourselves we esteem 
potatoes beyond any other vegetable), 
yet few persons know how to cook 
them. Shall we be bold enough to 
commence our hints by presuming to 
hrform our " grandmothers" how 

123. To BOIL POTATOES? Put them 
inio a saucepan with scarcely sufficient 
water to cover them. Directly the skins 
begia to break, lift them from the fire, 
and M vapidly as possible pour off every 
drop of the water. Then place a coarse 
(we need not%ay clean) towel over 
them, and return them to the fire again 
until they are thoroughly done, and 
quite dry. A little salt, to taste, should 
have been added to the water before 
boiling-. 

124. POTATOES FRIED WITH FISH. 
Take cold fish and cold potatoes. Pick 
all the bones from the former, and mash 
the fi*h and the potatoes together. 
Form into rolls, and fry with lard until 
the outsides are brown and crisp. For 
this purpose, the drier kinds of fish, 
iuch as cod, are preferable. Eels, &c., 
are not so good. This is an economi- 
tal and excellent relish. (See 104.) 

125. POTATOES MASHED WITH 
ONIONS. Prepare some boiled onions, 
3 



by putting them through a sieve, and 
mix them with potatoes. Regulate the 
portions according to taste. 

126. POTATO CHEESE CAKES. 
One pound of mashed potatoes, quarter 
of a pound of currants, quarter of a 
pound of sugar and butter, and four 
eggs, to be well mixed together ; bake 
them in patty pans, having first lined 
them with puff paste. 

127. POTATO COLCANON. Boil po- 
tatoes and greens, and spinach, sepa- 
rately ; mash the potatoes ; squeeze the 
greens dry ; chop them quite fine, and 
mix them with the potatoes with a little 
butter, pepper, and salt. Put into a 
mould, buttering it well first; let it 
stand in a hot oven for ten minutes. 

128. POTATOES ROASTED UNDER 
MEAT. Half boil large potatoes ; drain 
the water ; put them into an earthen 
dish, or small tin pan, under meat roast- 
ing before the fire ; baste them with the 
dripping. Turn them to brown on all 
sides ; send up in a separate dish. 

129. POTATO BALLS RAGOUT. 
Add to a pound of potatoes a quarter 
of a pound of grated ham, or some 
sweet herbs, or chopped parsley, an 
onion or eschalot, salt, pepper, and a 
little grated nutmeg, and other spice, 
with the yolk of a couple of eggs ; then 
dress as potatoes escolloped. 

130. POTATO SNOW. Pick out 
the whitest potatoes, put them on in 
cold water; when they begin to crack, 
strain, and put them in a clean stew- 
pan before the fire till they are quite 
dry, and fall to pieces; rub them 
them through a wire sieve or the dish 
they are to be sent up in, and do not 
disturb them afterwards. 

131. POTATOES FRIED WHOLE. 
When nearly boiled enough, put them 
into a stew-pan with a bit of butter, or 
some clean beef drippings; shake them 
about often to prevent burning, til 
they are bro>*n and crisp ; drain them 
frojp the fat. It will be an improve- 
ment if they are floured and dipped into 
the yolk of an egg, and then rolled in 
finely-sifted bread crumbs. 

132. POTATOES FRIED IN SLICES 



BETTER GO TO BED SUPPERLESS THAN Ru,*; IN DEBT. 



Peel large potatoes, slice them about a 
quarter of an inch thick, or cut them into 
shavings, as you would peel a lemon ; 
dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry 
them in lard or dripping. Take care 
that the fat and frying-pan are quite 
clean ; put it on a quick fire, and as 
soon as the lard boils, and is still, put 
in the slices of potato, and keep moving 
them until they are crisp ; take them 
up, and lay them to drain on a sieve. 
Send to table with a little salt sprink- 
led over them. 

133. POTATOES ESCOLLOPED 
Mash potatoes in the usual way ; then 
butter some nice clean scollop-shells, 
patty-pans, or tea-cups, or saucers ; put 
m your potatoes; make them smooth 
at the top ; cross a knife over them ; 
stew a few fine bread-crumbs on them ; 
sprinkle them with a paste-brush with 
a few drops of melted butter, and set 
them in a Dutch oven. When nicely 
browned on the top, take them care- 
fully out of the shells, and brown on 
the other side. Cold potatoes may be 
warmed up in this way. 

134. POTATO SCONES. Mash boiled 
potatoes till they are quite smooth, 
adding a little salt; then knead out 
the flour, or barley-meal, to the thick- 
ness required; toast on the griddle, 
pricking with a fork to prevent them 
blistering. When eaten with fresh or 
salt butter they are equal to crumpets 
even superior, and very nutritious. 

135. POTATOE PIE. Peel and slice 
your potatoes very thin into a pie-dish ; 
between each layer of potatoes put a 
little * chopped onion ; between each 
layer sprinkle a little pepper and salt : 
put in a little water, and cut about two 
ounces of fresh butter into bits, and lay 
them on the top ; cover it close with 
paste. The yolks of four eggs may be 
added ; and when baked, a table-spoon- 
ful of good mushroom ketchup poured 
in through a funnel. Another method 
is to put between the layers small Jiits 
of mutton, beef, or pork. (See. 31.) 

136. GINGER-BEER POWDERS. 
Blue paper: Carbonate of soda, 
thirty grains ; powdered gingei , five 



grains ; ground white sugar, one drachm 
to one drachm and a-half; essence of 
lemon, one drop. Add the essence to 
the sugar, then the other ingredients. 
A quantity should be mixed and divid- 
ed, as recommended for Seidlitz pow- 
ders. White paper : Tartaric acid, 
thirty grains. 

Directions. Dissolve the contents 
of the blue paper in water ; stir in the 
contents of the white paper, and drinl? 
during effervescence. Ginger-beer pow 
ders do not meet with such general 
approbation as lemon and kali, the 
powdered ginger rendering the liquid 
slightly turbid. 

137. APPLE BREAD. A very 
light pleasant bread is made in France 
by a mixture of apples and flour, in the 
proportion of one of the former to two 
of the latter. The usual quantity of 
yeast is employed as in making com- 
mon bread, and is beaten with flour and 
warm pulp of the apples after they have 
boiled, and the dough is then considered 
as set ; it is then put in a proper vessel, 
and allowed to rise for eight or twelve 
hours, and then baked in long loaves. 
Very little water is requisite: none, 
generally, if the apples are very fresh. 

138. TO MAKE ANCHOVIES. 
Procure a quantity of sprats, as fresh 
as possible ; do not wash or wipe them, 
but just take them as caught, and for 
every peck of the fish take two pounds 
of common salt, quarMr of a pound of 
bay-salt, four pounds of saltpetre, two 
ounces of sal-prunella, and two penny- 
worth of cochineal. Pound all these 
ingredients in a mortar, mixing them 
well together. Then take stone jars or 
small kegs, according- to your quantity 
of sprats, and lay a layer of the fish, 
and a layer of the mixed ingredients 
alternately, until the pot is full ; then 
press hard down, and cover close for 
six months, they will then be fit for use 
I can vouch for the excellence and 
cheapness of the anchovies made in thia 
manner. 

139. CEMENT FOR BROKEN 
CHINA, GLASS, &c. The following 
recipe, from experience, we know to be 



WHEN THE TREE IS FALLEN EVERT MAN RUSHES TO IT WITH A HATCHBT. 53 



R good one, and, being nearly colourless, 
it possesses advantages which liquid 
glue and other cements do not : Dis- 
solve half an ounce of gum acacia in 
a, wine glass of boiling water ; add plas- 
ter of Paris sufficient to form a thick 
paste, and apply it with a brush to the 
parts required to be cemented together. 
Several articles upon our toilette table 
have been repaired most effectually by 
this recipe. (See 78.)

141. BLACKING (Paste). Half a 
pound of ivoiy black, half a pound of 
treacle, half an ounce of powdered 



56 



BETTER GO ROUND THAN FALL INTO THE DITCH. 



aluin, one drachm of turpentine, one 
ounce of eulphuric acid, and two ounces 
of raw linseed oil. The ivory black 
and treacle must first be mixed to- 
gether until thoroughlj incorporated; 
then add the rest of the ingredients. It 
keeps best in a bladder. This receipt 
has been used in a friend's family for 
the last seventeen years, and is much 
approved. 

142. SUC CEDANEUM. Take an 
old silver thimble, an old silver coin, or 
other silver article, and with a very fine 
file, convert it into filings. Sift through 
gauze, to separate the coarse from the 
fine particles. Take the finer portion, 
and mix with sufficient quicksilver to 
form a stiff amalgam, and while in this 
state, fill the cavities of decayed teeth. 
This is precisely the same as the metal- 
lic amalgam used by all dentists. 
Quicksilver may be bought at a trifle 
per half-ounce or ounce, at the chem- 
ist's. We have not the slightest hesi- 
tation in pronouncing this to be the best 
thing of the kind. Caution : as it turns 
black under the action of the acids of 
the mouth, it should be used sparingly 
for front teeth. A tooth should never 
be filled while it is aching. (See 144.) 

143. LEMONS, WHOLE, FOR 
DESSERT. Take six fine, fresh, well- 
shaped lemons, cut a hole just round 
the stock, and with a narrow spoon 
scoop put the pippins, and press out 
the juice, but leave the pulp in the 
lemons. Put them into a bowl with 
two or three quarts of spring water, to 
steep out the bitterness. Leave them 
three 'days, changing the water each 
day ; or only two days if you wish them 
to be very bitter. Strain the juice as 
soon as squeezed out, boil it with one 
pound of loaf-sugar (setting the jar into 
which it was strained in a pan of boil- 
ing water fifteen or twenty minutes) ; 
*ie it up, quite hot, with bladder, and 
Bet by till wanted. Taste the water 
the lemons are lying in at the end of 
the third day; if not bitter, lift the 
lemons out into a china-lined pan, pour 
the water through a strainer upon them, 
boil gently one or two hours sot by in 



the pan. Boil again next day until BO 
tender that the head of a large needle 
will easily pierce the rind. Put in one 
pound of loaf-sugar, making it just boil, 
and leave to cool. Next day boil the 
syrup, and pour it to the lemons; add 
:ne pound of sugar, and hot water to 
supply what was boiled away. Lift 
out the lemons, and boil the syrup and 
pour on them again every day for a 
fortnight, then every three or four days, 
adding gradually three pounds of sugar 
When the lemons look clear and bright, 
boil the syrup pretty hard, add the 
lemon juice which had been set by, just 
boil, skim ; put the lemons into jars, 
pour the syrup upon them, and tie up 
the jars instantly with bladder. 

144. THE TEETH. Dissolve two 
oz. borax in three pints of water ; be* 
fore quite cold, add thereto one tea- 
spoonful of tincture of myrrh and one 
tablespoonful of spirits of camphor ; bot- 
tle the mixture for use. One wineglass 
of the solution, added to half a pint of 
tepid water, is sufficient for each appli- 
cation. This solution, applied daily, 
preserves and beautifies the teeth, ex- 
tirpates tartarous adhesion, produces a 
pearl-like whiteness, arrests decay, and 
induces a healthy action in the gums. 
(See 142.) 

145. CAMPHORATED DENTIFRICE. 
Prepared chalk, one pound; cam- 
phor, one or two drachms. The cam- 
phor must be finely powdered by moist- 
ening it with little spirits of wine, and 
then intimately mixed with the chalk. 

146. MYRRH DENTIFRICE. Pow- 
dered cuttle fish, one pound ; powdered 
myrrh, two ounces. 

147. COMPOUNDS TO PRO- 
MOTE THE GROWTH OF HAIR. 
When the hair falls off from dimin- 
ished action of the scalp, preparations 
of cantharides often prove useful ; they 
are sold under the names of Dupuy- 
tren's Pomade, Cazenaze's Pomade, 
&c. The following directions are as 
good as any of the more complicated 
recipes : 

148. POMADE AGAINST BALDNESS. 
Beef marrow, soaked in several wa- 



WILLOWS ARE WEAK, YET THEY BIND OTHEB. WOOD. 



57 



ters, melted and strained, half a pound ; 
tincture of cantharides (made by soak- 
ing for a week one drachm of powdered 
cantharides in one ounce of proof spirit), 
one ounce; oil of bergamot, twelve 
irops. 

149. ERASMUS WILSON'S LOTION 
AGAINST BALDNESS. Eaude Cologne, 
two ounces; tincture of cautharides, 
two drachms ; oil of lavender or rose- 
mary, of each ten drops. These appli- 
cations must be used once or twice a 
day for a considerable time ; but if the 
scalp become sore, they must be dis- 
continued for a time, or used at longer 
intervals. 

150. BANDOLINE OR FIXATURE. 
Several preparations are used ; the fol- 
lowing are the best : 

No. 1. MuciLage of clean picked 
Irish moss, made by boiling a quarter 
of an ounce of the moss in one quart of 
water until sufficiently thick, rectified 
spirit in the proportion of a teaspoon- 
ful to each bottle, to prevent its being 



mildewed. The quantity of spirit varies 
ling to the time it requires to be 
kept. 



according 



No. 2. GumTragacanth, one drachm 
and a half; water, half a pint; proof 
spirit (made by mixing equal parts of 
rectified spirit and water), three 
ounces ; otto of roses, ten drops ; soak 
for twenty-four hours and strain. 

151. MEDICINES (APERIENT) 
In the spring time of the year the 

judicious use of aperient medicines is 
much to be commended. 

152. SPRING APERIENTS. For 
children nothing is better than: 1. 
Brimstone and treacle ; to each tea- 
cupful of this, when mixed, add a 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. As 
this sometimes produces sickness, the 
following may be used : 2. Take of 
tartrate of soda one drachm and a half, 
powdered jalap and powdered rhubarb 
each fifteen grains, ginger, two grains 
mix. Dose for a child above five years 
one small teaspoonful: above ten 
years, a large teaspoonful ; above fif- 
teen, half the whole, or two teaspoon- 
fuV and for a person above twenty, 



three teaspoonfuls, or the whole, as 
may be required by the habit of the 
person. This medicine may be dis- 
solved in warm water, common or 
mint tea. This powder can be kept 
for use in a wide-mouthed bottle, and 
be in readiness for any emergency. 
The druggist may be directed to treble 
or quadruple the quantities as conve- 
nient. 

153. APERIENT PILLS. To some 
adults all liquid medicines produce 
such nausea that pills are the only 
form in which laxative medicines can 
be exhibited ; the following is a useful 
formula : 3. Take of compound rhu- 
barb pill a drachm and one scruple, of 
powdered ipecacuanha six grains, and 
of extract of hyoscyamus one scruple 
Mix and beat into a mass, and divide 
into twenty-four pills. Take one, or 
two, or if of a very costive habit, three 
at bed-time. 4. For persons requiring 
a more powerful purge the same for 
mula, with ten grains of compound 
extract of colocynth, will form a good 
purgative pill. The mass receiving 
this addition must be divided into 
thirty, instead of twenty-four pills. 

154. BLACK DRAUGHT. 5. The 
common aperient medicine known as 
black draught is made in the following 
manner: Take of senna leaves six 
drachms, bruised ginger, half a drachm 
sliced liquorice -root four drachms, 
boiling water half an imperial pint. 
Keep this standing- on the hob, or near 
the fire, for three hours, then strain, 
and after allowing it to grow cool, add 
of sal volatile one drachm and a-half, 
of tincture of senna, and of tincture of 
cardamoms, each half an ounce. (This 
mixture will keep a long time in a cool 

.) Dose, a wineglassful for an 



adult; two tablespoontuls for young 
persons above fifteen years of age. It 
is not a suitable medicine for chil- 
dren. 

155. TONIC APERIENT. 6. Take of 
Epsom salts one ounce, diluted sulphu- 
ric acid one drachm, infusion of quassia 
chips half an imperial pint, compound 
tincture of rhubarb two d racking. Half 



68 



CHILDREN AND CHICKENS MUST ALWAYS BE PICKING. 



a wineglassful for a dose twice 
day. 

156. INFANTS' APERIENT 7. Tak 
of rhubarb five grains, magnesia thre 

trains, white sugar a scruple, mann 
ve grains ; mix. Dose, varying from 
a piece half the size of a sweet-pea t 
a piece the size of an ordinary pea. 
8. A useful laxative for children i 
composed of calomel two grains, an< 
sugar a scruple, made into five pow 
ders ; half of one of these for a chili 
from birth to one year and a-half, anc 
a whole one from that age to five 
years. 

157. FLOUR OP BRIMSTONE is a 
mild aperient in doses of about a quar 
ter of an ounce ; it is best taken in milk 

158. MEDICINE WEIGHTS AND 
MEASURES. All medicines are mix 
ed by apothecaries' weight : this musi 
be carefully borne in mind, as the 
apothecaries' drachm is more than 
double that of avoirdupois or the com- 
mon weights. A set of the proper 
weights may be obtained at any scale- 
makers ; and they will be found to be 
marked thus : 



5 Grains 



Scruples thus, 3 



Drachms thus, 3 Ounces thus, 3 

APOTHECARIES' WEIGHT. 

20 grains make 1 scruple 9i 
3 scruples " 1 drachm 3i 
8 drachms " 1 ounce 3i 
12 ounces " 1 pound nr 
Medicines are always purchased 
wholesale by avoirdupois weight. For 
compounding liquids an apothecary's 
glass measure will be found indispensa- 
ble. A two or three ounce size will 
be large enough for most purposes. 

159. METHOD OF CURING THE 
STINGS OF BEES AND WASPS. 
The sting of a bee is generally more 
virulent than that of a wasp, and with 
some people attended with very violent 
effects. The sting of a bee is barbed at 
the end, and, consequently, always left 
in the wound ; that of a wasp is pointed 
only, BO that they can sting more than 
once, w^ich a bee cannot do. When 



any person is stung by a bee, let the 
sting, in the first place, be instantly 
pulled out ; for the longer it remains 
in the wound the deeper it will pierce, 
owiug to its peculiar form, and emit 
more of the poison. The sting is hoi. 
low, and the poison flows through it, 
which is the sole cause of the pain and 
inflammation. The pulling out of the 
sting should be done carefully, and 
with a steady hand, for if any part of it 
breaks in, all remedies then, in a great 
measure, will be ineffectual. When 
the sting is extracted, suck the wounded 
part, if possible, and very little inflam- 
mation, if any, will ensue. If hartshorn 
drops are immediately afterwards rub- 
bed on the part, the cure will be more 
complete. All notions of the efficacy 
of sweet oil, bruised parsley, burne^ 
tobacco, &c., appear, on various trials, 
to be totally groundless. On some 
people the sting of bees and wasps 
lave no effect ; it is therefore of little 
consequence what remedy they apply 
to the wound. However, the effect 
f stings greatly depends on the habit 
f body a person is of; at one time a 
sting shall take little or no effect, 
;hough no remedy is used, which at 
mother time will be very virulent OD 
he same person. We have had occasion 
o test this remedy several times, and 
?an safely avouch its efficacy. The 
exposure to which persons are subject 
ed during the hot summer months, wiD 
no doubt render this advice very use- 
ul ; its very simplicity making it more 
.cceptable. 

160. PRESERVED PLUMS. 
xut your plums in half (they must not 
'6 quite ripe), and take out the stones 
Weigh the plums, and allow a pound of 
oaf-sugar to a pound of fruit. Crack 
be stones, take out the kernels, and 
reak them in pieces. Boil the plums 
nd kernels very slowly for abou 
fteen minutes, in as little water a 
ossible. Then spread them on a lurga 
ish to cool, and strain the liquor 
lext day make your syrup. Melt tha 
:igar in as little water as will suffice tv- 
issolve it (about a gill of water to a 



LITTLE STICKS KINDLE THE FIEE, BUT GREAT ONES PUT IT OUT. 



59 



pound of sugar), and boil it a few 
minutes, skimming it till quite clear. 
Then put in your plums with the 
liquor, and boil them fifteen minutes. 
Put them In jars, pour the juic* over 
them warm, and tie them up when cold, 
with brandy paper. Plums for common 
uee are very good done in treacle. Put 
your plums into an earthen vessel that 
holds a gallon, having first slit each plum 
with a kn' f e. To three quarts of plums 
put a pint of treacle. Cover them, and 
set them on hot coals in the chimney 
corner. Let them stew for twelve 
hours or more, occasionally stirring 
them and renewing the coals. The next 
day put them up in jars. Done in this 
manner, they will keep till the next 
Spring. Syrups may be improved in 
clearness by adding to the dissolved 
sugar and water some white of egg very 
well beaten, allowing the white of one 
egg to two pounds of sugar. Boil it 
very hard (adding the egg shell), and 
skim it well, that it may be quite clear 
before you put in your fruit. In the 
season for" preserves " our readers may 
be glad of the above instructions, which 
have been adopted with great success. 
Hints about making preserves, 61, are 
well worthy of attention. (See also, 39, 
61,89, 112, 120, and 121.) 

161. ^EVENING AMUSEMENTS 
WITH CARDS. Playing at cards, 
or any other game, for money or any- 
thing else of value, is a practice to be 
reprobated; but frr pleasant amuse- 
ment at an evening party, cards are 
extremely attractive. 

Raphael introduces to the notice of 
his young readers the system of an 
amusement which is in itself perfectly 
harmless, and at the same time both 
amusing and interesting. In the words 
of a celebrated author, " Divination 
(or that which is understood by the 
common term fortune-telling, and which 
of itself is both ambiguous and inappli- 
cable) may be pursued, in order to ob- 
tain an idea of the ultimate conse- 
quences of any action or thought, 

See "Tricks with Carl*/' published by 
Dick & Fitzgerald 
3* 



provided a system be uniform and 
carefully observed." The same au- 
thor further adds, " that the sympa- 
thies of nature provide the means of 
elucidation if the mind is sufficiently 
anxious." 

To this Raphael might raise some 
question. He, however, offers the fol- 
lowing, hoping it may be productive 
of amusement in the sense he intends 
it. 

Take a pack of cards, and we will 
presume the presiding genius to be a 
lady of very fair and light complexion ; 
she will then be represented by the 
queen of diamonds, as persons of dif- 
ferent complexions are represented by 
the different suits of the pack. Thus 
diamonds represent the fairest, hearts 
the next fair, clubs a dark complexion, 
and spades very dark persons. Ladies 
are represented by the queens of the 
respective suits, and gentlemen by the 
kings. The jack or knave of each 
suit represents the person's thoughts of 
that suit of which the king represents 
the party ; thus if a king of diamonds 
represents a very fair man the knave 
of diamonds represents his thoughts. 
In order to proceed, let the cards be 
properly shuffled, and if the presiding 
personage tells his or her own destiny, 
he or she is represented by the card 
(king or queen, according to the sex), 
as above described, or if another per- 
son's, that person is represented in 
like manner. Suppose one is telling 
another their prospects ; let that per- 
son cut the pack, after being shuffled, 
into three lots, then, taking up the lots 
indiscriminately, let the cards be laid 
out (faces uppermost) in rows of nine 
in a row ; then, as there are fifty -two 
cards in the pack, therswill be five 
rows of nine each, and one of seven at 
the bottom ; these being laid on a ta- 
ble will form nearly a square. The 
representative card will of course be 
seen in one of the rows, and commenc- 
ing with that as one, count nine cards 
in every way possible, then the cards 
ending at nine in the various countings 
will denote what is to come to

OF THE COURT OF CARDS. 

The Kings represent Males according 
to the complexion . 



The Queens represent Females in like 

manner. 

The Knaves, the Thoughts of the re- 
spective parties. 

Therefore, as example, suppose nine 
cards being counted out four different 
ways, or even more, and let the person 
be a young lady whose destiny is to be 
determined, and the six of hearts, the 
eight of hearts, the ten of hearts, and 
ten of diamonds, are the four terminat- 
ing cards, it is shown that the lady in 
question will speedily receive particu- 
lar attentions from a gentleman ; that 
she will have some new apparel, go to 
some place of public amusement, and 
take a journey, or have money given to 
her. Supposing the queen of the suit 
representing the lady in question lying 
on the table faces to the right hand, 
and a knave or king- of clubs so placed 
as to look towards her, it shows the at- 
tention she will receive will be from a 
dark gentleman ; if it is the knave, and 
very close, it may be one of the com- 
pany, or near to her, or not residing far 
)ff; but if distant, he is from a distance, 
[t is not imperative to lay the cards out 
in rows of nine each, only that it affords 
a means of counting to a greater num- 
>er of cards. When several diamonds 
come together, it is a sign of receipt of 
money; several hearts, love; several 
clubs, drink and debauch ; and several 
pades, vexation and disappointment ; 
Spades are the most untoward signifi- 
cation. A married lady, in reading the 
'uture, must make her husband king 
of her own suit ; but a single lady must 
make her lover king of his own suit. 
The knaves of the suit are representa- 
ive of their thoughts ; so that what is 
ruling in their minds may be learned 
>y counting from them, alway^ taking 
care to include the representative card. 
A single lady may see how her lover is 
disposed towards her by the way in 
which his representative card lies fthat 
s, if the king's or knave's face is 
;owards her card, it is well ; if the back 
s turned he is not true, or is inattentive, 
and his thoughts are directed to another 
object. 



ALL THINGS HAVE A BEGINNING, GOD EXCEPTED. 



61 



If any one desires to know if she 
will have her wish, let her shuffle the 
cards well (as she likewise must on 
other occasions), wishing all the time 
for some one thing ; then cut them once, 
and, remembering carefully what card 
she cuts, she should shuffle them again, 
and deal the pack into three parcels ; 
look over each parcel, and if you find 
the card you cut in the first instance 'in 
the same parcel as your representa- 
tive card, there are great hopes ; if it 
conies next, or within one or two, you 
will certainly have your wish; if the 
nine of spades is in the same parcel, a 
disappointment awaits you as regards 
your wish; if the card (the nine of 
spades) is near your representative card, 
the disappointment will be heavy ; and 
according as you find the cards run in 
the parcel where your representative 
card is, so you may judge of the wish 
being realized. 

The nine of hearts is termed the wish 
card, and the seven of hearts the 
thoughts of the person whose destiny 
is being described, and according as 
these fall out in respect or next to other 
cards, must the result be construed. 
(See 489 and 2082.) 

162. TO MAKE GINGERBREAD 
CAKE. Take one pound and a-half 
of treacle, one and a-half ounces of 
ground ginger, half an ounce of carra- 
way seeds, two ounces of allspice, four 
ounces of orange peel, shred fine ; half 
a pound sweet butter, six ounces 
blanched almonds, one pound honey,

soda, with as much fine flour as makes 
a dough of moderate consistence. 
Directions for baking it. Make a pit 
in five pounds flour, then pour in the 
treacle, and all the other ingredients, 
creaming the butter; then mix them 
all together into a dough, work it well, 
then put in three quarters of an ounce 
tartaric acid, and put the dough into a 
buttered pan, and bake for two hours 
in a cool oven. To know when it is 
ready, dip a fork into it, and if it comes 
out sticky put it in the oven again; if 
not, it is read/

181. BLACKING. Blacking is now 
always made with ivory black, treacle, 
linseed or sweet oil, and oil of vitriol. 
The proportions vary in the different 
directions, and a variable quantity of 
water is added, as paste or liquid black- 
ing is required ; the mode of making 
being otherwise precisely the same. 
(See 141.) 

182. LIQUID BLACKING. 1. Ivory 
black and treacle of each one pound, 
sweet oil and oil of vitriol of each a 
quarter of a pound. Put the first three 
together until the oil is perfectly mixed 
or " killed; 1 ' then add the oil of vitriol 
diluted with three times its weight of 
water, and after standing three hours 
add one quart of water or sour beer. 

2. In larger quantity it may be 
made as follows: ivory black three 
cwt., molasses or treacle two cwt., 
linseed oil three gallons, oil of vitriol 
twenty pounds, water eighty gallons. 
Mix as above directed. 

183. PASTE BLACKING. 1. Ivory 
black twc pounds, treacle one pound, 
olivo oil and oil of vitriol of each 



A SLOTHFUL MAN IS A BEGGAR'S BROTHER. 



63 



quarter of a pound. Mix as before, 
adding only sufficient water to form 
into a paste. 

2. In larger quantity: Ivory black 
three cwt., common treacle twD cwt., 
1'jiseed oil and vinegar bottoms of each 
three gallons, oil of vitriol twenty-eight 
pounds, water a sufficient quantity. 
Note. The ivory black must be very 
finely ground for liquid blacking, other- 
wise it settles rapidly. The oil of vit- 
riol is powerfully corrosive when undi- 
luted, but uniting with the lime of the 
ivory black, it is partly neutralized, and" 
does not injure the leather, whilst it 
much improves the quality of the black- 
ing. 

184. BEST BLACKING FOR BOOTS 
AND SHOES. Ivory black one and a- 
half ounce, treacle one and a-half ounce, 
Bperin oil three drachms, strong oil of 
vitriol three drachms, common vinegar 
half a pint. Mix the ivory black, trea- 
cle, and vinegar together, then mix the 
sperm oil and oil of vitriol separately, 
and add them to the other mixture. 

185. BOOT-TOP LIQUID. Ox- 
alic acid and white vitriol of each one 
ounce, water one and a-half pint. To 
be applied with a sponge to the leather, 
previously washed, and then washed off 
again. This preparation is poisonous. 

186. BLACK REVIVER FOR 
BLACK CLOTH. Bruised galls one 
pound, logwood two pounds, green 
vitriol half a pound, water five quarts. 
Boil for two hours, and strain. Used 
to restore the colour of black cloth. 

187. LIQUID FOR PRESERV- 
ING FURS FROM MOTH. Warm 
water, one pint ; corrosive sublimate, 
twelve grains. If washed with this, 
and afterwards dried, furs are safe from 
moth. Care should taken to label the 
liquid poison. 

188. FRENCH POLISHES. 1. 
N" APT HA POLISH. Shellac, three 
pounds; wood naptha, three quarts. 
Dissolve. 

189. 2. SPIRIT POLISH. Shellac, 
two pounds; powdered ruast'c and 
sandarac, of each one ounce; copal 

half a pint; spirits >: wine 



one gallon. Digest in the cold till dis 
solved. 

190. BRILLIANT WHITEWASH. 
Many have heard of the brilliant 
stucco whitewash on the east end 01 
the President's house at Washington. 
The following is a receipt for it ; it is 
gleaned from the National Intelligencer, 
with some additional improvements 
learned by experiments. Take half a 
bushel of nice unslacked lime, slack it 
with boiling water, cover it during the 
process to keep in the steam. Strain 
and* the liquid through a fine sieve or strain- 
er, and add to it a peck of salt, pre- 
viously well dissolved in warm water ; 
three pounds of ground rice, boiled to 
a thin paste, and stirred in boiling hot ; 
half a pound of powdered Spanish 
whiting, and a. pound of clean glue, 
which has been previously dissolved by- 
soaking it well, and then hanging it 
over a slow fire, in a small kettle within 
a large one filled with water. Add five 
gallons of hot water to the mixture, 
stir it well, and let it stand a few days 
covered from the dirt. 

It should be put on right hot; for 
this purpose it can be kept in a kettle 
on a portable furnace. It is said that 
about a pint of this mixture will cover 
a square yard upon the outside of a 
house if properly applied. Brushes 
more or less small may be used accord- 
ing to the neatness of the job required. 
It answers as well as oil paint for wood, 
brick or stone, and is cheaper. It re- 
tains its brilliancy for many years. 
There is nothing of the kind that will 
compare with it, either for inside or 
outside walls. 

Colouring matter may be put in and 
made of any shade you like. Spanish 
brown stirred in will make red pink, 
more or less deep according to the 
quantity. A delicate tinge of this is 
very pretty, for insid** walls. Finely- 
pulverized common clay, well mixed 
with Spanish brown, make a reddish 
stone colour.* Yellow-ochre stirred in 
makes yellow wash, but crome goes 
further, and makes a colour generally 
esteemed prettier. In all th** case*

A FOOL'S BOLi IS SOON SHOT. 



the darkness of the shades of course is 
determined by the quantity of colour- 
ing used. It is difficult to make rules 
because tastes are different , it would 
be best to try experiments on a shingle 
and let it dry. We have been told 
that green must not be mixed with 
lime. The lime destroys the colour, 
and the colour has an effect on the 
whitewash, which makes it crack and 
p< <_!. When walls have been badly 
smoked and you wish to have them a 
clean white, it is well to squeeze indigo 
plentifully through a bag into the water 
you use, before it is stirred in the whole 
mixture. If a larger quantity than five 
gallons be wanted, the same proportion 
should be observed. 

191. HUSBAND AND WIFE. 
Being hints to each other for the good 
of both, as actually delivered at our 
own table : 

192. HINTS FOR WIVES. If your 
husband occasionally looks a little 
troubled when he comes home, do not 
say to him, with an alarmed counte- 
nance, " What ails you, my dear ?" 
Don't bother him ; he will tell you of 
his own accord, if need be. Don't rat- 
tle a hailstorm of fun about his ears 
either ; be observant and quiet. Don't 
suppose whenever he is silent and 
thoughtful that you are of course the 
cause. Let him alone until he is in- 
clined to talk ; take up your book or 
your needlework (pleasantly, cheer- 
fully; no pouting no sulleuness), and 
waft until he is inclined to be sociable. 
Don't let him ever find a shirt-button 
missing.- A shirt-button being off a col 
lar or wrist-band has frequently pro- 
duced the first hurricane in married 
life. Men's shirt-collars never fit ex- 
actly see that your husband's are 
made as well as possible, and then, if 
he does fret a little about them, never 
mind it; men have a prescriptive right 
to fret about shirt-collars. 

193. HINTS FOR HUSBANDS If 
your wife complains that -young ladies 
" now-a-day" are very forward, don't 
accuse her of jealousy. A little con- 
cern on her part only proves her lore 



for you, and you may enjoy your tri 
umph without saying a word. Don't 
evince your weakness either, by com- 
plaining of every trifling neglect. What 
though her chair is not set so close to 
yours as it used to be, or though her 
knitting and crochet seem to abeord too 
large a share of her attention, depend 
upon it that, as her eyes watch the 
mtertwinings of the threads, and the 
manoeuvres of the needles as they 
dance in compliance to her delicate 
fingers, she is thinking of courting days, 
4ove-letters, smiles, tears, suspicions, 
and reconciliations, by which your two 
hearts became entwined together in 
the network of love, whose meshes 
you can neither of you unravel or 
escape. 

194. HINTS FOR WIVES. Never 
complain that your husband pores too 
much over the newspaper, to the ex^ 
elusion of that pleasing converse which 
you formerly enjoyed with him. Don't 
hide the paper ; don't give it to the 
children to tear ; don't be sulky when 
the boy leaves it at the door ; but take 
it in pleasantly, and lay it down before 
your spouse. Think what man would 
be without a newspaper ; treat it as a 
great agent in the work of civilization, 
which it assuredly is ; and think how 
much good newspapers have done by 
exposing bad husbands and bad wives, 
by giving their errors to the eye of the 
public. But manage you in this way : 
when your husband is absent, instead 
of gossiping with neighbors, or looking 
into shop windows, sit down quietly, 
and look over that paper; run your 
eye over its homo and foreign news ; 
glance rapidly at the accidents and 
casualties ; carefully scan the leading 
articles; and at tea-time, when your 
husband again takes up the paper, say, 
" My dear, what an awful state of 
things there seems to be in India ;" or 
" what a terrible calamity at the Glas- 
gow theatre;" or " trade appears to be 
flourishing in the north !" and depend 
upon it down will go the paper. If he 
has not read the information, he will 
hear it all from your lips, and whe 



A LIAR SHOULD HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

you have done, he will ask, " Did you, 
my dear, read Simpson's letter upon 
the discovery of chleroform?" And 
whether you did or not, you will grad- 
ually get into as cosy a chat as you 
ever enjoyed; and you will soon dis- 
cover that, rightly used, the newspaper 
is the wife's real friend, for it keeps the 
husband at home, and supplies capital 
topics for every-day table-talk. 

195. HINTS FOR HUSBANDS. You 
can hardly imagine how refreshing it is 
to occasionally call up the recollection 
of your courting days. How tediously 
the hours rolled away prior to the ap- 
pointed time of meeting; how swift 
they seemed to fly, when met; how 
fond was the first greeting ; how 
tender the last embrace ; how fervent 
were your vows ; how vivid your 
dreams of future happiness, when, re- 
turning to your home, you felt yourself 
secure in the confessed love of the ob- 
ject of your warm affections. Is your 
dream realized ? are you so happy as 
you expected ? Why not ? Consider 
whether as a husband you are as fer- 
vent and constant as you were when a 
lover. Remember that the wife's claims 
to your unremitting regard great be- 
fore marriage, are now exalted to a 
much higher degree. She has left the 
world for you the home of her child- 
hood, the fireside of her parents, their 
watchful care and sweet intercourse 
bave 'all been yielded up for you. Look 
then most jealously upon all that may 
tend to attract you from home, and to 
weaken that union upon which your 
temporal happiness mainly depends; and 
believe that in the solemn relationship 
of husband is to be found one of the 
best guarantees for man's honour and 
happiness. 

196. HINTS FOR WIVES. Per- 
chance you think that your husband's 
disposition is much changed ; that he is 
no longer the sweet-tempered, ardent 
lover he used to be. This may be a 
mistake. Consider his struggles with 
the world his everlasting race with 
the busy competition of trade. What 
IB it makes him so oajjer in the pursuit 



of gain so energetic by day, so sleep- 
less by night but his love of home, 
wife, and children, and a dread that 
their respectability, according to the 
light in which he has conceived it, may 
be encroached upon by the strife of ex- 
istence. This is the time secret of that 
silent care which preys upon the hearts 
of many men ; and true it is, that when 
love is least apparent, it is nevertheless 
the active principle which animates the 
heart, though fears and disappoint- 
ments make up a cloud which obscures 
the warmer element. As .above the 
clouds there is glorious sunshine, while 
below are showers and gloom, so with 
the conduct of man behind the gloom 
of anxiety is a bright fountain of high 
and noble feeling. Think of this in 
those moments when clouds seem to 
lower upon your domestic peace, and 
by tempering your conduct accordingly, 
the gloom will soon pass away, and 
warmth and brightness take its place. 

197. HINTS FOR HUSBANDS. Sum- 
mer is the season of love ! Happy birds 
mate, and sing among the trees ; fishes 
dart athwart the running streams, and 
leap from their element in resistless 
ecstacy ; cattle group in peaceful nooke, 
by cooling streams ; even the flowers 
seem to love as they twine their tender 
arms around each other, and throw 
their wild tresses about in beautiful 
profusion; the happy swain sits with 
his loved and loving mistress beneath 
the sheltering oak, whose arms spread 
out, as if to shield and sanctify their 
pure attachment. What shall the hus- 
band do now, when earth and heaven 
seem to meet in happy union ? Must 
he still pore over the calculations of the 
counting-house, or ceaselessly pursue 
the toils of the work-room sparing no 

iment to taste the joys which Heaven 
measures out so liberally 1 No ! " Come, 
dear wife, let us once more breathe the 
fresh air of heaven, and look upon the 
beauties of earth. The summers are 
few we may dwell together; we will 
not give them all to Mammon. Again 
[et our hearts glow with emotions of 
renewed love our feet shall again

tread the green sward, and the music 
of the rustling trees shall mingle in our 
whisperings of love !" 

198. HINTS FOR WIVES. " It 
was !" " It was not !" " It was .''"'It 
was not /" " Ah !" Ha !" Now 
who's the wiser or the better for this 
contention for the last word? Does 
obstinacy establish superiority, or elicit 
truth ? Decidedly not ! Woman has 
always been described as clamoring for 
the last word ; actors, authors, preach- 
ers, and philosophers, have agreed in 
attributing this trait to her, and in cen- 
suring her for it. Yet why they should 
condemn her, unless they wish the 
matter reversed, and thus committed 
themselves to the error imputed to her, 
it were difficult to discover. However, 
so it is ; and it remains for some one 
of the sex, by an exhibition of noble 
example, to aid in sweeping away the 
unpleasant imputation. The wife who 
will establish the rule of allowing her 
husband to have the last word, will 
achieve for herself and her sex a great 
moral victory ! Is he right ? it were 
a great error to oppose him. Is he 
wrong ? he will soon discover it, and 
applaud the self- command which bore 
nnvexed his pertinacity. And gradually 
there will spring up such a happy fusion 
of feelings and ideas, that there will be 
no " last word" to contend about but 
a steady and unruffled flow of generous 
sentiment. 

199. HINTS FOR HUSBANDS. When 
once a man has established a home, his 
most important duties have fairly begun. 
The errors of youth may be overlooked ; 
want of purpose, and even of honour, 
in his earlier days, may be forgotten. 
But from the moment of his marriage 
he begins to write his indelible history; 
not by pen and ink, but by actions by 
which he must eve- afterwards be re- 
ported and judged. His conduct at 
home ; his solicitude, for his family ; the 
training of his children ; his devotion to 
his wile ; his regard for the great inter 
ests of eternity ; these are the tests by 
which his worth will ever afterwards 
be estimated by all who think or care 



about him. These will determine his 
position while living, and influence, his 
memory when died. He uses well or 
ill the brief space allotted to him out 
of all eternity, to build up a fame found 
ed upon the most solid of all founda- 
tions private worth; and God will 
judge him, and man judge of him ac- 
cordingly. 

200. HINTS FOR WIVES. Don't 
imagine when you have obtained a hus- 
band that your attention to personal 
neatness and deportment may be re- 
laxed. Now, in reality, is the time for 
you to exhibit superior taste and excel- 
lence in the cultivation of your address, 
and the becoming elegance of your ap- 
pearance. If it required some little 
care to foster the admiration of a lovei 
how much more is requisite to keep 
yourself lovely in the eyes of him, to 
whom there is now no privacy or dis- 
guise your hourly companion? And 
if it was due to your lover that you 
should always present to him, vfhopro- 
posed to wed and cherish you, a neat 
and lady-like aspect ; how much more 
is he entitled to a similar mark of re- 
spect, who lias kept his promise with 
honourable fidelity, and linked all his 
hopes of future happiness with yours ? 
If you can manage these matters with- 
out appearing to study them, so much 
the better. Some husbands are impa- 
tient of the routine of the toilette, and 
not unreasonably so they possess ac- 
tive and energetic spirits, sorely dis- 
turbed by any waste of time. Some 
wives have discovered an admirable 
facility in dealing with this difficulty ; 
and it is a secret which, having been 
discovered by some, may be known to 
all and is well worth the finding 
out. 

201. HINTS FOR HUSBANDS. Cus- 
tom entitles you to be considered the 
" lord and master" over your household 
But don't assume the master and sink 
the iord. Remember that noble gener 
osity, forbearance, amiability, and in 
tcgrity, are among the more lordly at 
tributes of man. As a husband 
therefore, exhibit the true nobility o

man, and seek to govern your own 
household by the display of high moral 
excellence. A domineering spirit a 
fault-finding petulance impatience of 
trifling delays and the exhibition of 
unworthy passions at the slightest prov- 
ocation, can add no laure-l to your own 
" lordly" brow, impart no sweetness to 
home, and call forth no respect from 
those by whom you may be surrounded. 
It is one thing to be a master another 
thing to be a man. The latter should 
be the husband's aspiration ; for he who 
cannot govern himself is M-qualified to 
govern another. 

202. HINTS TO WIVES. It is as- 
tonishing how much the cheerfulness 
of a wife contributes to the happiness 
of home. She is the sun the centre 
of a domestic system, and her children 
are like planets around her, reflecting 
her rays. How merry the little ones 
look when the mother is joyous and 
good-tempered ; and how easily and 
pleasantly her household labours are 
overcome! Her cheerfulness is re- 
flected everywhere: it is seen in the 
neatness of her toilette, the order of her 
table, and even the seasoning of her 
dishes. We remember hearing a hus- 
band say that he could always guage 
the temper of his wife by the quality of 
her cooking: good temper even influ- 
enced the seasoning of her soups-, and 
the lightness and delicacy of her pastry. 
When ill temper pervades, the pepper 
is dashed in as a cloud ; perchance the 
top of the pepper-box is included, as a 
kind of diminutive thunderbolt ; the 
salt is all in lumps ; and the spices seem 
to betake themselves all to one spot in 
a pudding, as if dreading the frowning 
face above them. If there be a hus- 
band who could abuse the smiles of a 
really good-tempered wife, we should 
like to look at him ! No, no, such a 
phenomenon does not exist. Among 
elements of domestic happiness, the 
'imiability of the wife and mother is of 
the utmost importance it is one of the 
best securities for the HAP?INESS OF 
HOME, 



203. HINTS FOR HOME COM- 
FORTS. 

A short needle makes the most ex- 
pedition in plain sewing. 

When you are particular in wishing 
to have precisely what you want from 
a butcher's, go and purchase it your- 
self. 

One flannel petticoat will wear near- 
ly as long as two, if turned behind -part 
before, when the front begins to wear 
thin. 

People in general are not aware ho\* 
very essential to the health of their in- 
mates is the free admission of light into 
their houses. 

A leather strap, with a buckle to 
fasten, is much more commodious than 
a cord for a box in general use for short 
distances ; cording and uncording is a 
nasty job. 

There is not any real economy in 
purchasing cheap calico for gentlemen's 
night shirts. The calico cuts in holes , 
and soon becomes bad coloured in 
washing. 

Sitting to sew by candle-light by a 
table with a dark cloth on it is injurious 
to the eye-sight. When no other remedy 
presents itself, put a sheet of white pa- 
per before you. 

People very commonly complain of 
indigestion: how can it be wondered 
at, when they seem by their habit of 
swallowing their food wholesale, to for- 
get for what purpose they are provided 
with teeth. 

Never allow your servants to put 
wiped knives on your table ; for, gene- 
rally speaking, you may see that they 
have been wiped with a dirty cloth. 
If a knife is brightly cleaned, they are 
compelled to use a clean cloth. 

There is not anything gained in econo- 
my by having very young and inexperi- 
enced servants at low wages ; they 
break, waste, and destroy more than 
an equivalent for higher wages, setting 
aside comfort and respectability.

A WORD BEFORE IS WORTH TWO BEHIND. 



a lady in nice mourning should, in her 
9Vi>ning walks, at all seasons of the 
yt-;tr, take as * companion an old para- 
BO! to shade ter crape. 

A piece of oil-cloth (about twenty 
inches long) is a useful appendage to a 
common sitting-room. Kept in the 
closet, it can be available at any time 
to place jars upon, &c., &c., which are 
likely to soil your table during the pro- 
cess of dispensing their contents : a 
wing and duster are harmonious accom- 
paniments to the oil-cloth. 

In most families many members are 
not fond of fat ; servants seldom like it, 
consequently there is frequently much 
wasted ; to avoid which, take off bits 
of suet fat from beef-steaks, &c., pre- 
vious to cooking ; they can be used for 
puddings. With good management, 
there need not be any waste in any 
shape or form. 

Nothing looks worse than shabby 
gloves ; and, as they are expensive arti- 
cles in dress, they require a little man- 
agement. A good glove will last six 
cheap ones with care. Do not wear 
your best gloves to night church the 
neat of the gas, &c., gives a moisture 
to the hands that spoils the gloves ; do 
not wear them in very wet weather ; 
as carrying umbrellas, and drops of 
rain, spoil them. 

A given quantity of tea is similar to 
malt only giving strength to a given 
quantity of water, as we find therefore 
any additional quantity is waste. Two 
small teaspoonfuls of good black tea, 
and one three parts full of green, is 
sufficient to make three teacupsful 
agreeable, the water being put in, in a 
boiling state, at once ; a second edition 
of water gives a vapid flavour to tea. 

It may sound like being over particu- 
lar, but we recommend persons to make 
a practice of fully addressing notes, 
&c., on all occasions; when, in case 
of their being dropped by careless mes- 
gengers (which is not a rare occur- 
rence), it is evident for whom they are 
intended, without undergoing the inspec- 
tion of any other parties bearing a simi- 
lar name. 



Children should not be allowed to 
ask for the same thing twice. This 
may be accomplished by parents, 
teacher (or whoever may happen to 
have the management of them), paying 
attention to their little wants, if proper, 
at once, when possible. The children 
should be instructed to understand that 
when they are not answered immedi- 
ately, it is because it is not convenient. 
Let them learn patience by waiting. 

We know not of anything attended 
with more serious consequences than 
that of sleeping in damp linen. Per- 
sons are frequently assured that they 
have been at a fire for many hours, 
but the question is as to what sort of 
fire, and whether they have been prop- 
erly turned, so that every part may 
be exposed to the fire. The fear of 
creasing the linen, we know, prevents 
many from unfolding it, so as to be 
what we consider sufficiently aired; 
but health is of more importance than 
appearances ; with gentleness there 
need be no fear of want of neatness. 

If the weather appears doubtful, al 
ways take the precaution of having an 
umbrella when you go out, particu- 
larly in going to church ; you thereby 
avoid incurring one of three disagreea- 
bles: in the first place, the chance of 
getting wet or encroaching under a 
friend's umbrella or being under the 
necessity of borrowing one, conse- 
quently involving the trouble of re- 
turning it, and possibly (as is the case 
nine times out of ten) inconveniencing 
your friend by neglecting to return it. 
Those who disdain the use of um- 
brellas generally appear with shabby 
hats, tumbled bonnet ribbons, wrinkled 
silk dresses, &c., &c., the consequence 
of frequent exposure to unexpected 
showers, to say nothing of colds taken, 
no one can tell how. 

Exercise in the open air is of the 
first importance to the human frame, 
yet how many are in a manner de- 
prived of it by their own want of man- 
agement of their time ! Females with 
slender means are for the most part 
destined to in- door occupations, and 



A BLIND MAN SHOULD NOT JUDGE OF COLOURS 



cave but little time allotted them lor 
taking the air, and that little time is 
generally sadly encroached upon by 
the ceremony of dressing to go out. 
It may appear a simple suggestion, but 
experience only will show how much 
time might be redeemed by habits of 
regularity; such as putting the shawls, 
cloaks, gloves, shoes, clogs, &c., &c., 
or whatever is intended to be worn, in 
readiness, instead of having to search 
one drawer, then another, for possibly 
a glove or collar wait for shoes being 
cleaned, &c. and this when (probably) 
the out-going persons have to return to 
their employment at a given time. 
Whereas, if all were in readiness, the 
preparations might be accomplished in 
a few minutes, the walk not being cur- 
tailed by unnecessary delays. 

Eat slowly and you will not over- 
eat. 

Keeping the feet warm will prevent 
headaches. 

Late at breakfast hurried for din- 
ner cross at tea. 

Between husband and wife little at- 
tentions beget much love. 

Always lay your table neatly, whether 
you have company or not. 

Put your balls or reels of cotton into 
little bags, leaving the ends out. 

Whatever you may choose to give 
iway, always be sure to keep your tem- 
per. 

Dirty windows speak to the passer- 
by of the negligence of the inmates. 

In cold weather, a leg of mutton im- 
proves by being hung three, four, or 
Sve weeks. 

When meat is hanging, change its 
position frequently, to equally distribute 
the juices. 

There is much more injury done by 
admitting visitors to invalids than is 
generally supposed. 

Matches, out of the reach of children, 
should be kept in every bed-room. They 
are cheap enough 

Apple and suet dumplings are lighter 
when boiled in a net than a cloth. Scum 
the pot well. 

When chamber towels get thin in the 



middle, cut them in two, sew the Bel- 
vages together, and hern the sides 

When you dry salt for the table, do 
not place it in the salt-cells until it is 
cold, otherwise it will harden into a 
lump. 

Never put away plate, knives and 
forks, &c., uncleaued, or sad inconve- 
nience will arise when the articles are 
wanted. 

Feather-b.eds should be opened every 
third year, the ticking well dusted, 
soaped, and waxed, the feathers dress- 
ed and returned. 

Persons of defective sight, when 
threading a needle, should hold it over 
something white, by which the sight 
will be assisted. 

In mending sheets and shirts, put 
the pieces sufficiently large, or in the 
first washing the thin parts give way. 
and the work is all undone. 

Reading by candle-light, place the 
candle behind you, that the rays may 

This will relieve the eyes. 

A wire fire-guard, for each fire-place 
in a house, costs little, and greatly 
diminishes the risk to life and property. 
Fix them before going to bed. 

In winter, get the work forward by 
daylight, to prevent running about at 
night with candles. Thus you escape 
grease spots and risks of fire. 

Be at much pains to keep your chil 
dren's feet dry and warm. Don't bury 
their bodies in heavy flannels and wools, 
and leave their knees and legs naked. 

Apples and pears, cut into quarters, 
and stripped of the rind, baked with a 
little water and sugar, and eaten with 
boiled rice, are capital food for chil- 
dren. 

After washing, overlook linen, and 
stitch on buttons, hooks and eyes, &c. ; 
for this purpose, keep a " housewife's 
friend," full of miscellaneous threads, 
cottons, buttons, hooks, &o. 

For ventilation open your windows, 
both at top and bottom. The fresh 
air rushes in one way, while the foul 
makes its exit the other. This is letting

ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS. 



204. COOKERY FOR CHILD REN. 

205. FOOD FOR AN INFANT. Take 
of fresh cow's milk, one tablespoonful, 
and mix with two tablespoonfuls of 
hot water ; sweeten with loaf-sugar as 
much as may be agreeable. This quan- 
tity i sufficient for once feeding a new- 
born infant; and the same quantity 
may be given every two or three hours, 
not oftener, till the mother's breast 
affords natural nourishment. 

206. MILK FOR INFANTS Six 
MONTHS OLD. Take one pint of milk, 
one pint of water ; boil it, and add one 
tablespoonful of flour. Dissolve the 
flour first in half a teacupful of water ; 
it must be strained in gradually, and 
boiled hard twenty minutes. As the 
child grows older, one third water. If 
properly made, it is the most nutritious, 
at the same time the most delicate food, 
that can bo given to young children. 

207. BROTH. Made of lamb or 
chicken, wjtn stale bread toasted, and 
broken in, is safe and healthy for the 
dinners of children, when first weaned. 

208. MILK. Fresh from the cow, 
with a very little loaf-sugar, is good and 
safe food for young children. From 
three years old to seven, pure milk, 
into which is crumbled stale bread, is 
the best breakfast and supper for a 
child. 

209. FOR A CHILD'S LUNCHEON 
Good sweet butter, with stale bread, is 
one of the most nutritious, at the same 
time the most wholesome articles of 
food, thJtt can be given children after 
they are .weaned. 

210. MILK PORRIDGE. Stir four 
tablespoonfuls of oatmeal, smoothly, 
into a quart of milk ; then stir it 
quickly into a quart of boiling water, 
and boil up a few minutes till it is 
thickened : sweeten with sugar. Oat- 
meal, where it is found to agree with 
the stomach, is much better for chil- 
dren, being a fine opener as well as 
cleanser ; fine flour, in every shape, is 
the reverse. Where biscuit-powder is 
in use, let it be made at home ; this, 
at all events, will prevent them getting 
the sweepings of the baker's counters, 



boxes, and baskets. All the left bread 
in the nursery, hard ends of stale 1 iaves, 
&c., ought to be dried in the oven of 
screen, and reduced to powder in the 
mortar. 

211. MEATS FOR CHILDREN. Mut- 
ton, lamb, and poultry, are the best 
Birds and the white meat of fowls, ar 
the most delicate food of this kind tha 
can be given. ' These meats should b 
slowly cooked, and no gravy, if mad 
rich with butter, should be eate by 
young child. Never give children hard 
tough, half-worked meats, of any kind. 

212. VEGETABLES FOR CHILDREN. 
EGGR, &c. Their rice ought to be 
cooked in no more water than is neces- 
sary to swell it ; their apples roasted, 
or stewed with no more water than is 
necessary to steam them ; their vege- 
tables so well cooked as to make them 
require little butter, and less digestion ; 
their eggs boiled slow and soft. The 
boiling of their milk ought to be di- 
rected by the state of their bowels ; if 
flatulent or bilious, a very little curry- 
powder may be given in their vegeta- 
bles with good effect- such as turme- 
ric and the warm seeds (not hot pep- 
pers) are particularly useful in such 
cases. 

213. POTATOES AND PEAS. Pota- 
toes, particularly some kinds, are not 
easily digested by children ; but this is 
easily remedied by mashing them very 
fine, and seasoning them with sugar and 
a little milk. When peas are dressed 
for children, let them be seasoned with 
mint and sugar, which will take off the 
flatulency. If they are old let them 
be pulped, as the skins are perfectly 
indigestible by children's or weak sto- 
machs. Never give them vegetables 
less stewed than would pulp through a 
colander. 

214. RICE PUDDING WITH FRUIT. 
In a pint of new milk put two large 
spoonfuls of rice well washed ; then 
add two apples, pared and quartered, 
or a few currants or raisins. Simmer 
slowly till the rice is very soft, then 
add one egg, beaten, to bind it. Serve 
with cream and sugar. 



A SWALLOW MAKES NOT SUMMER OR SPRING TIME. 



71 



215. PUDDINGS AND PANCAKES 
FOB CHILD BEN. Sugar and egg, 
browned before the fire, or dropped as 
fritters into a hot frying pan, without 
fat, will make them a nourishing meal. 

216. To PREPARE FRUIT FOR CHIL- 
DREN. A far more wholesome way 
than in pics or puddings, is to put ap- 
ples sliced, or plums, currants, goose- 
berries, &c., into a stone jar ; and 
sprinkle among them as much sugar as 
necessary. Set the jar in an oven on 
a hearth, with a teacupful of water to 
prevent the fruit from burning ; or put 
the jar into a saucepan of water till its 
contents be perfectly done. Slices of 
bread or some rice may be put into the 
jar, to eat with the fruit. 

217. RICE AND APPLES. Core as 
many nice apples as will fill the dish ; 
boil them in light syrup; prepare a 
quarter of a pound of rice in milk, with 
sugar and ealt ; put some of the rice in 
the dish, and put in the apples and fill 
up the intervals with rice, and bake it 
in the oven till it is a fine colour. 

218. A NICE APPLE CAKE FOR 
CHILDREN. Grate some stale bread, 
and slice about double the quantity of 
apples ; butter a mould, and line it with 
sugar paste, .and strew in some crumbs, 
mixed with a little sugar ; then lay in 
apples, with a few bits of butter over 
them, and so continue till the dish is 
full ; cover it with crumbs, or prepared 
rice ; season with cinnamon and sugar. 
Bake it well. 

219. FRUITS FOR CHILDREN. That 
fruits are naturally healthy in their sea- 
son, if rightly taken, no one who believes 
that the Creator is a kind and benefi- 
cent Being can doubt. And yet the 
use of summer fruits appears often to 
cause most fatal diseases, especially in 
children. Why is this ? Because we 
do not conform to the natural laws in 
using this kind of diet. These laws are 
very simple and easy to understand. 
Let the fruit be ripe when you eat it ; 
and eat when you require food. Fruits 
that have seeds are much healthier than 
the stone fruits. But all fruits are 
better, for very young children, if i 



baked or cooked in some manner, and 
eaten with bread. The French always 
eat bread with raw fruit. Apples and 
winter pears are very excellent food 
for children, indeed, for almost any 
person in health ; but best when eaten 
for breakfast or dinner. If taken late 
in the evening, fruit often proves in- 
jurious. The old saying that apples are 
gold in the morning, silver at noon, and 
lead at night, is pretty near the truth. 
Both apples and pears are often good 
and nutritious when baked or stewed, 
for those delicate constitutions that 
cannot bear raw fruit. Much of the 
fruit gathered when unripe, might be 
rendered fit for food by preserving in 
sugar. (See 108.) 

220. RIPE CURRANTS are excellent 
food for children. Mash the fruit, 
sprinkle with sugar, and with good 
Dread let them eat of this fruit freely. 

221. BLACKBERRY JAM. Gather 
the fruit in dry weather ; allow half a 
pound of good brown sugar to every 
pound of fruit ; boil the whole together 
gently for an hour, or till the blackber- 
ries are soft, stirring and mashing them 
well. Preserve it like any other jam, 
and it will be found very useful in fam- 
ilies, particularly for children regu- 
lating their bowels, and enabling you 
to dispense with cathartics. It may be 
spread on bread, or on puddings, in- 
stead of butter: and even when the 
blackberries are bought, it is cheaper 
than butter. In the country, every 
family should preserve, at least, half a 
peck of blackberries. 

222. To MAKE SENNA AND MANNA 
PALATABLE. Take half an ounce, 
when mixed, senna and manna; put in 
half a pint of boiling water ; when the 
strength is abstracted, pour into the 
liquid from a quarter to half a pound 
of prunes and two large tablespoonfuls 
of W. I. molasses. Stew sl<fwly until 
the liquid is nearly absorbed. When 
cold it can be eaten with bread and 
butter, without detecting the senna, 
and is excellent for costive children.

TO DRESS RICE. Wash him well, 
much wash in cold water, the rice flour 
make him stick. Water boil all ready 
very fast. Throw him in, rice can't 
burn, water shake him too much. Boil 
quarter of an hour or little more ; rub 
one rice in thumb and finger, if all rub 
away him quite done. Put rice in co- 
lander, hot w r ater run away ; pour cup 
of cold water on him, put back rice in 
saucepan, keep him covered near the 
fire, then rice all ready. Eat him up ! 

226. CEMENTS. The term cement 
include^ all those substances employed 
for the purpose of causing the adhesion 
of two or more bodies, whether origi- 
nally separate, or divided by an acci- 
dental fracture. As the substances that 
are required to be connected together 
are exceedingly various, and differ very 
much in their properties as to texture, 
&c., &ct, and as the conditions under 
which they are placed, with regard to 
heat and moisture, are also exceedingly 
variable, a number of cements, possessed 
of very different properties, are re- 
quired ; for a cement that answers ad- 
mirably under one set of circumstances, 



may be perfectly useless in others. A 
vast number of cements are known and 
used in the various arts, but they may 
all be referred to a few classes ; and 
our object in this paper will be to de- 
scribe the manufacture and use of the 
best of each class, and also to state what 
are the general principles upon which 
the success or failure of cementing 
usually depends. The different parts 
of a solid are held together by an at- 
traction between their several particles, 
which is termed the attraction of co- 
hesion, or cohesive attraction. The 
amount of this varies with the sub- 
stances ; thus, the cohesion of the par- 
ticles of iron to one another is enor- 
mously great, whilst that between those 
of chalk is but email. This attraction 
acts only when the particles are in the 
closest possible contact ; even air must 
not be between them. If, after break- 
ing any substance, we could bring the 
particles into as close contact as before, 
and remove the air, they would re-unite, 
and be as strongly connected as ever. 
But, in general, this is impossible ; 
small particles of grit and dust get be- 
tween them ; the film of interposed air 
cannot be removed; and thus, however 
firmly we press the edges of a broken 
cup together, it remains cracked china 
still. Perfectly flat, clean surfaces, like 
those of freshly ground plate-glass, may 
sometimes be made to cohere, so that 
the two pieces become one, and cannot 
be separated without breaking. The 
attraction of cohesion takes place be- 
tween the parts of the same substance, 
and must not be confounded with that 
of adhesion, which is the attraction ol 
different substances to one another; 
for example, the particles of a piece of 
wood are united by cohesive attraction, 
whilst the union of glue and wood to 
each other depends on adhesive attrac- 
tion. And it is important that this 
distinction be borne in mind, for, in al- 
most all cases, the cohesion between 
the particles of the cement is verj 
much less than the adhesion of the ce 
ment to other bodies ; and if torn apart, 
the connected joint gives way not by 



OPINION IS PRIVATE PROPERTY VVHICH THE LAW CANNOT SEIZE. 



73 



the loosening of tho adhesion, but by 
the layer of cement splitting down the 
centre. Hence the important rule, 
that the less cement in a joint, the 
stronger it is. Domestic manipulators 
usually reverse this, by letting as much 
cement as possible remain in the joint, 
which is, therefore, necessarily a weak 
one. A thick, nearly solid cement, 
which cannot be pressed out of the 
''oint, is always inferior to a thinner 
one, of which merely a connecting film 
remains between the united surfaces. 
Having thus mentioned the general 
principles that ought always to be borne 
in mind, we will now proceed to de- 
scribe the manufacture and uses of 
some of the more useful cements. 

227. MOUTH GLUE affords a very 
convenient means of uniting papers, and 
other small light objects; it is made 
by dissolving by the aid of heat, pure 
glue, as parchment glue, or gelatine, 
with about one quarter or one-third of 
its weight of coarse brown sugar, in as 
small ^ quantity of boiling water as 
possible; this, when perfectly liquid, 
should be cast into thin cakes on a flat 
surface very slightly oiled, and as it 
cools cut up into pieces of a convenient 
size. When required for use one end 
may be moistened by the mouth, and 
is then ready to be rubbed on any 
substances it may be wished to join ; 
a piece kept in the desk or work- 
box is exceedingly convenient. (See 
63.) 

228. PASTE is usually made by rub- 
bing up flour with cold water and boil- 
ing; u a little alum is mixed before 
boiling it is much improved, being less 
clammy, working more freely in the 
brush and thinner, a less quantity is 
required, and it is therefore stronger. 
If required in large quantity, as for 
papering rooms, it may be made by 
mixing one quartern of flour, one quar- 
ter pound of alum, and a little warm 
water ; when mixed, the requisite quan- 
tity of boiling water should be poured 
on whilst the mixture is being stirred. 
Paste is only adapted to cementing 
paper ; when used it should be spread 



on one side of the paper, which should 
then be folded with the pasted side in- 
wards and allowed to remain a few 
minutes before being opened and used ; 
this swells the paper, and permits ita 
being more smoothly and securely at- 
tached. Kept for a few days, paste be- 
comes mouldy, and after a short time 
putrid ; this inconvenience may be ob- 
viated by the use of 

229. PERMANENT PASTE, made by 
adding to each half -pint of flour-paste 
without alum, fifteen grains of corrosive 
sublimate, previously rubbed to powder 
in a mortar, the whole to be well mix- 
ed ; this, if prevented from drying, by 
being kept in a covered pot, remains 
good any length of time, and is there- 
fore convenient; but unfortunately it is 
extremely poisonous, though its exces- 
sively nauseous taste would prevent its 
being swallowed accidentally; it pos- 
sesses the great advantage of not being 
liable to the attacks of insects. 

230. LIQUID GLUE. Several prepa- 
rations were much in vogue a few 
months since under this title. The 
liquid glue of the shops is made by dis- 
solving shellac in water, by boiling it 
along with borax, which possesses the 
peculiar property of causing the solu- 
tion of the resinous lac. This prepara- 
tion is convenient from its cheapness 
and freedom from smell ; but it gives 
way if exposed to long-continued damp, 
which that made with naphtha resists. 
Of the use of common glue very little 
need be said ; it should always be pre- 
pared in a glue-pot or double vessel, to 
prevent its being burned, which injures 
it very materially ; the objection to the 
use of this contrivance is, that it renders 
it impossible to heat the glue in the 
inner vessel to the boiling point ; this 
inconvenience can be obviated by em- 
ploying in the outer vessel some liquid 
which boils at a higher temperature 
than pure water, such as saturated so- 
lution of salt (made by adding one-third 
as much salt as water). This boils 
at 224 Fahr., twelve degrees above 
the heat of boiling water, and enables 
the glue in the inner vessel to be heated 



74 



REVENGE IS THE- ONLY DEBT WHICH IT IS WRONG TO PAY. 



to a much higher temperature than 
when pure water is employed. If a 
saturated solution of nitre is used, the 
temperature rises still higher. (See 66.) 

231. LIME AND EGG CEMENT is 
frequently made by moistening the 
edges to be united with white of egg, 
dusting on some lime from a piece of 
muslin, and bringing the edges into 
contact. A much better mode is to 
slake some freshly-burned lime with a 
small quantity of boiling water; this 
occasions it to fall into a very fine dry 
powder, if excess of water has not been 
added. The white of egg used should 
be intimately and thoroughly mixed, 
by beating, with an equal bulk of water, 
and the slaked lime added to the mix- 
ture, BO as to form a thin paste, which 
should be used speedily, as it soon sets. 
This is a valuable cement, possessed of 
great strength, and capable of with- 
standing boiling water. Cements made 
with lime and blood, scraped cheese, or 
curd, may be regarded as inferior va- 
rieties of it. Cracked vessels, of earth- 
enware and glass, may often be useful- 
ly, though not ornamentally, repaired 
by white lead spread on strips of calico, 
and secured with bands of twine. But, 
in point of strength, all ordinary ce- 
ments yield the palm to Jeffery's Pat- 
ented Marine Glue, a compound of 
India-rubber, shellac, and coal-tar naph- 
tha. Small quantities can be purchased 
nt most of the tool warehouses, at 
cheaper rates than it can be made. 
When applied to china and glass, the 
substances should be cautiously made 
not enough to melt the glue, which 
should be then rubbed on the edges so 
as to become fluid, and the parts brought 
into contact immediately. When well 
applied, the mended stem of a common 
tobacco-pipe will break at any other 
part, in preference to the junction. 
The colour of the glue unfortunately 
prevents its being used. 

232. THE RED CEMENT, which is 
employed by instrument makers for 
fomenting glass to metals, and which is 
very cheap, and exceedingly useful for 
v variety of purposes, is made by melt- 



ing five parts of black resin, one part of 
yellow wax, and then stirring in gradu- 
ally one part of red ochre or Venetian 
red, in fine powder, and previously v.M 
dried. This cement requires to be 
melted before use, and it adheres better 
if the objects to which it is applied are 
warmed. A soft cement, of a some- 
what similar character, may be found 
useful for covering the corks of pre- 
served fruit, and other bottles, and it is 
made by melting yellow wax with an 
equal quantity of resin, or of common 
turpentine (not oil of turpentine, but 
the resin), using the latter for a very 
soft cement, and stirring in, as before, 
some dried Venetian red. Bearing in 
mind our introductory remarks, it will 
be seen that the uniting broken sub- 
stances with a thick cement is disad- 
vantageous, the object being to bring 
the surfaces as closely together as pos- 
sible. As an illustration of a right and 
a wrong way of mending, we will sup- 
pose a plaster of Paris figure broken ; 
the wrong way to mend it is by a thick 
paste of plaster, which makes, not a 
joint, but a botch. The right way to 
mend it, is by means of some well-made 
carpenter's glue, which, being absorbed 
in the porous plaster, leaves merely a 
film covering the two sufaces, and, if 
well done, the figure is stronger there 
than elsewhere. On carefully reading 
over our article, w r e find one useful sub- 
stance has been omitted, namely, what 
is termed mastic cement, which is used 
for making a superior coating to inside 
walls, and which must not be confound- 
ed with the resin mastic. It is made 
by mixing twenty parts of well-washed 
and sifted sharp sand, with two parts 
of litharge, and one of freshly-burned 
and slaked quick-lime, in fine dry pow- 
der. This is made into a putty, by 
mixing with linseed oil. It sets in a few 
hours, having the appearance of light 
stone; and we mention it, as it may 
be frequently employed with advantage 
in repairing broken stone -work (as 
stairs), by filling up the missing parts. 
The employment of Roman cement, 
plaster, &c., for masonry work, hardly

some pretty fat ham or bacon into 
slices, and fry of a nice brown ; lay 
them aside to keep warm; then mix 
equal quantities of potatoes and cab- 
bage, bruised well together, and fry 
them in the fat left from the ham. 
Place the mixture at the bottom, and 
lay the slices of bacon on the top. 
Cauliflower, or broccoli, substituted for 
cabbage, is truly delicious ; and, to any

236. NAMES AND SITUATIONS 
OF THE JOINTS. In different parts 
of the kingdom the method of cutting 
up carcases varies. That which we de- 
scribe below is the most general, and is 
known as the English method. 

BEEF Fore Quarter. Fore rib (five 
ribs); middle rib (four ribs); chuck 
( three ribs ). Shoulder piece ( top of 
fore leg ) ; brisket ( lower or belly part 
of the ribs ) ; clod ( fore shoulder blade); 
Deck ; shin ( below the shoulder ) ; 
cheek. 

Hind Quarter. Sirloin ; rump ; aitch- 
bone these are the three divisions of 
the upper part of the quarter ; buttock 
and mouse-buttock, which divide the 
thigh ; veiny piece, joining the buttock , 
4 



thick flank and thin flank ( belly pieces) 
and leg. The sirloin and rump of both 
sides form a baron. Beef is in season 
all the year ; lest in the winter. 

MUTTON. Shoulder; breast (the 
belly ) ; over which are the loin (chump, 
or tail end ). Loin (best end) ; and neck 
(best end) ; neck (scrag end). A cliino 
is two necks : a saddle, tw 7 o loins ; then 
there are the leg and head. Mutton is 
the best in Winter, Spring, and Au- 
tumn. 

LAMB is cut into fore quarter and 
hind quarter ; a saddle, or loin ; neck, 
breast, leg-, and shoulder. Grass lamb 
is in season from June to August. 

PORK is cut into leg, hand, or shoulder: 
hind-loin; fore-loin; belly-part; spare- 
rib (or neck) ; and head. Pork is in 
season nearly all the year. 

VEAL is cut into neck (scrag-end); 
neck (best end) ; loin (best end) ; loin 
(chump, of tail end) ; fillet (upper part 
of the hind leg) ; hind knuckle (which 
joins the fillet knuckle of fore leg ; 
blade (bone of shoulder); breast (best 
end ) ; breast (brisket end) and hand. 
Veal is always in season, but dear in 
the Winter, and Spring. 

237. VENISON is cut into haunch 
(or back) ; neck ; shoulder ; and breast. 
Doe venison is best in January, October, 
November, and December, and Buck veni- 
son in June, July, August, and Sep- 
tember. 

OX-TAIL is much esteemed for pur- 
poses of soup ; so also is the CHEEK. 
The TONGUE is highly esteemed. 

CALVES' HEADS are very useful for 
various dishes ; so also their KNUCKLES 

FEET, HEART, &C. 

238. II. RELATIVE. ECONOMY OP 
THE JOINTS. 

The round is, in large families, one 
of the most profitable parts. It is usu- 
ally boiled, and like most of the boiling 
parts of beef, is generally sold less than 
roasting- joints. 

The brisket is also a penny a pound 
?ess in price than the roasting parts. It 
is not so economical a part as the round, 
having more bono to be weighed with 
it, and more fat. Where there are 



76 



PAST SERVICES SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. 



children, very fat joints are not desir- 
able, being often disagreeable to them, 
and sometimes prejudicial, especially if 
they have a dislike to it. This joint 
also requires more cooking than many 
others : that is to say, it requires a 
double allowance of time to be given 
for boiling it ; it will, when served, be 
hard and scarcely digestible, if no more 
time be allowed to boil it than that 
vrhich is sufficient for other joints and 
meats. When stewed it is excellent ; 
and when cooked fresh (i. e. unsalted), 
an excellent stock for soup may be ex- 
tracted from it, and yet the meat will 
serve ac well for dinner. 

The edgebone, or aitchbone, is not con- 
sidered to be a very economical joint, the 
bone being large in proportion to the 
meat ; but the greater part of it, at 
least, is as good as that of any prime part. 
It sells at a penny a pound less than 
roasting joints. 

The rump is the part of which the 
butcher makes great profit, by selling 
it in the form of steaks. In the coun- 
try, as tlvre is not an equal demand 
for steaks, the whole of it may be pur- 
chased as a joint, and at the price of 
other prime parts. It may be turned 
to good account in producing many ex- 
cellent dishes. If salted, it is simply 
boiled; if used unsalted, it is usually 
stewed. 

The veiny piece is sold at a low price 
per bound ; but if hung for a day or two 
it is very good and very profitable. 
Where there are a number of servants 
and children to have an early dinner, this 
part of beef will be found desirable. 

From the leg- and sliin excellent 
itock for soup may be drawn ; and, if 
not reduced too much, the meat taken 
from the bones may be served as a stew 
with vegetables ; or it may be seasoned 
pounded with butter, and potted; or 
chopped very fine, and seasoned with 
herbs, and bound together ty egg and 
bread crumps; it may be fried in balls, 
or in the form of large eggs, and served 
with a gravy made with a few spoon- 
fuls of the soup. 

Of half an ox check excellent soup 



may be made ; the meat, when taken 
from the bones, may be served as a 
stew. 

Roasting parts of beef are the sir- 
loin and the ribs, and these bear in all 
places the highest price. The most 
profitable of these two joints at a family 
table is the ribs. The bones if remov- 
ed from the beef before it is roasted, 
will assist in forming the basis of a 
soup. When boned, the meat of the 
ribs is often rolled up, tied with strings, 
and roasted ; and this is the best way 
of using it, as it enables the carver tc 
distribute equally the upper part of the 
meat with the moce skinny and fatter 
parts at the lower end of'fhe bo lies. 

239. III. COOKING. 

Ten pounds of beef require from two 
hours to two hours and a-half roast- 
ing, eighteen inches from a good clear 
fire. 

Six pounds require one hour and a- 
quarter to one hour and a-half, four- 
teen inches from a good clear fire. 

Three ribs of beef, boned and rolled, 
tied round with paper, will require two 
hours and a-half, eighteen inches from 
the fire ; baste once only. 

The first three ribs of fifteen 01 
twenty pounds, will take three hours or 
three and a-half; the fourth and fifth 
ribs will take as long, managed iu the 
same way as the sirloin. Paper the fat 
and the thin part, or it will be done too 
much, before the thick part is done 
enough. 

When beef is very fat, it does not 
require basting; if very lean, tie it up 
in greasy paper, and baste frequently 
and well. 

Common cooks are generally fond of 
too fierce a fire, and of putting things 
too near to it. 

Slow roasting is as advantageous to 
the tenderness and Savour of meat as 
slow boiling. 

TVe warmer the weather, and tho 
staler killed the meat is, the less time 
it will require to roast it. 

Meat that is very fat require* more 
time than other meat. 



GOLD HAS MORE WORSHIPPERS THAN GOD.

" In the hands of an expert cook," 
gays Majendie, " alimentary substances 
are made almost entirely to change 
their nature, their form, consistence, 
odour, savour, colour, chemical com- 
position, &c.; everything is so modified, 
that it is often impossible for the most 
exquisite sense of taste to recognize the 
substance which makes up the basis of 
certain dishes. The greatest utility of 
the kitchen consists in making the food 
agreeable to the senses, and rendering 
it easy of digestion." 

Boiling extracts a portion of the juice 
of meat, which mixes with the water, 
and also dissolves some of its solids ; the 
more fusible parts of the fat melt out, 
combine with the water, and form soup 
or broth. The meat loses its red colour, 
becomes more savoury in taste and 
smell, and more firm and digestible. If 
the process is continued too long, the 
meat becomes indigestible, less succu- 
lent, and tough. 

To boil meat to perfection, it should 
be done slowly, in plenty of water, re- 
placed by other hot water as evapora- 
tion takes place ; for, if boiled too 
quickly, the outside becomes tough ; 
and not allowing the ready transmission 
of heat, the interior remains rare. 

The loss by boilfhg varies, according 
to Professor Donovan, from 6| to 16 
per cent. The average loss on boiling 
butcher's meat, pork, hams, and bacon, 
is 12 ; and on domestic poultry, is 
14|. 

The loss per cent, on boiling salt 
beef is 15 ; on legs of mutton, 10 ; hams, 
12 ; salt pork, 13 ; knuckles of veal, 
8^; bacon, 64 ; turkeys, 16; chickens, 
13}. 

The established rule as regards time, 
is to allow a quarter of an hour for each 
pound of meat if the boiling is rapid, 
arid twenty minutes if slow. There are 
exceptions to this; for instance, ham 
;iucl pork, which require from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes per pound, and 
bacon nearly half an hour. For solid 
joints allow fifteen minutes for every 
Douud; and from ten to twenty minutes 



over ; though, of course, the length of 
time will depend much on the strength 
of the fire, regularity in the boiling, and 
size of the joint. The following table 
will be useful as an average of the 
time required to boil the various ar- 
ticles : 

H. M

Roasting, by causing the contraction 
of the cellular substance which con- 
tains the fat, expels more fat than boil- 
ing. The free escape of watery par- 
tides in the form of vapour, so neces- 
sary to produce flavour, must be regu- 
lated by frequent basting with the fat 
which has exuded from the meat, 
combined with a little salt and water 
otherwise the meat would burn, and 
become hard and tasteless. A brisk 
fire at first will, by charring the out- 
side, prevent the heat from penetrating, 
and therefore should only be employed 
when the meat is half roasted. 

The loss by roasting varies, according 
to Professor Donovan, from 14 3-5ths 
to nearly double that rate, per cent. 
The average loss on roasting butcher's 
meat is 22 per cent. ; and on domestic 
poultry is 20. 

The loss per cent, on roasting beef, 
viz., on sirloins and ribs together, is 
19 l-6th; on mutton, viz., legs and 
shoulders together, 24 4-5ths ; on fore 
quarters of lamb, 22 l-3d ; on ducks, 
27 l-5th ; on turkeys, 20 : on geese , 
19J; on chickens, 14 3-5ths. So that 
it will be seen by comparison with the 
per centage given of the loss by boiling, 
that roasting is not so economical ; es- 
pecially when we take into account 
that the loss of weight by boiling ia 
not actual loss of economic materials, 
for we then possess the principal ingre- 
dients for soups ; whereas, after roast- 



78 THE PAST IS GONE THE FUTURE IS NOT COME THE PRESENT, WHERE IS IT ? 



ing, the fat only remains. The average 
loan in boiling and roasting together is 
38 percent, according to Donovan, and 
26 per cent, according to Wallace 
a difference that may be accounted for 
by supposing a difference in the fatness 
of the meat, duration and degree of 
heat, &c., employed. 

The time required to roast various 
articles of food with a clear good fire, is 
given below.

To roast properly, meat should be put 
a good distance from the fire,and brought 
gradually nearer when about half the 
time required for cooking it has elapsed ; 
it should be basted frequently ; and 
when nearly done, floured to make it 
look frothed. Old meats do not require 
BO much dressing as young ; and if not 
fat enough, use a little dripping for 
basting. Veal and mutton require a 
little paper put over the fat, to preserve 
it from being burn.. 

If roasting with a spit, be careful to 
have it well cleaned before running it 
through the meat, which should be 
dome always in the inferior parts ; but 
In many joints the spit will pass into the 
bones, and run along them for some 
distance, so as not to stain or injure the 
prime part. Balance skewers will fre- 
quently be required. 

Broiling requires a brisk rapid heat, 



which, by producing a greater degree 
of change in the affinities of the raw 
meat than roasting, generates a higher 
flavour, so that broiled meat is more 
savoury than roast. The surface be- 
coming charred, a dark-coloured crust 
is formed, which retards the evapora- 
tion of the juices; and, therefore, if 
properly done, broiled may be as tender 
and juicy as roasted meat. 

Baking does not admit of the evap- 
oration of the vapours so rapidly as 
by the processes of broiling and roast- 
ing ; the fat is also retained more, and 
becomes converted by the agency of 
the heat into an empyreumatic oil, so 
as to render the meat less fitted for del- 
icate stomachs, and more difficult to 
digest. The meat is, in fact, partly 
boiled in its own confined water, and 
partly roasted by the dry hot air of the 
oven. 

The loss by baking has not been esti- 
mated ; and, as the time required to 
cook many articles must vary with 
their size, nature, &c., we have con- 
sidered it better to leave that until 
giving the receipts for them. 

Frying is of all methods the most ob- 
jectionable, from the foods being less 
digestible when thus prepared, as 
the fat employed undergoes chemical 
changes. Olive oil in this respect is pref- 
erable to lard or butter. The crackling 
noise which accompanies the process of 
frying meat in a pan is occasioned by 
the explosions of steam formed in fat, 
the temperature of which is much above 
21 2 degrees. If the meat is very juicy 
t will not fry well, because it becomes 
sodden before the water is evaporated ; 
and it will not brown because the tem- 
perature is too low to scorch it. To 
ry fish well the fat should be boiling 
hot (600 degrees), and the fish irell 
dried in a cloth ; otherwise, owing to 
;he generation of steam, the tempera- 
;ure will fall go low that it will be boil- 
ed in its own steam, and not be brown- 
ed. Meat, or indeed any article," should 
>e frequently turned and agitated dnr- 
ing frying, to promote the evaporation 
of the watery particles. To make fried

things look well, the} should be done 
over twice with egg and stale bread 
crumbs. 

To some extent the claims of either 
process of cooking depends upon the 
taste o the individual. Some persons 
may esteem the peculiar flavour of fried 
meats, while others will prefer broils 
or stews. It is important, however, to 
understand the theory of each method 
of cooking, so that whichever may be 
adopted, it may be done well. Bad 
cooking, though by a good method, is 
far inferior to good cooking by a bad 
method. Therefore attend to 1972.

241. FREEZING WITHOUT ICE 
OR ACIDS. The use of ice in cooling 
depends upon the fact of its requiring a 
vast quantity of heat to convert it from 
a solid into a liquid state, or, in other 
words, to melt it, and the heat so re- 
quired it obtains from those objects 
with which it may be in contact. A 
pound of ice requires nearly as much 
heat to melt it as would be sufficient to 
make a pound of cold water boiling hot ; 
hence its cooling power is extremely 
great. But ice does not begin to melt 
until the temperature is above the 
freezing point, and therefore it cannot 
be employed in freezing liquids, &c., 
but only in cooling them. If, how- 
ever, any substance is mixed with ice 
which is capable of causing it to melt 
more rapidly, and at a lower tem- 
perature, a still more intense cooling 
effect is the result; such a substance is 
common salt, and the degree of cold 
produced by the mixture of one part of 
salt with two parts of snow or pound- 
ed ice, is greater than thirty degrees 
below freezing. In making ice creams 
and dessert ices, the following arti- 



cles are required : Pewter ice-pots 
with tightly-fitting lids, furnished with 
handles ; wooden ice-paiis, to hold the 
rough ice and salt, which should be 
stoutly made, about the same depth as 
the ice-pots, aud nine or ten inches 
more in diameter; each should have a 
hold in the side, fitted with a good cork, 
in order that the water from the melted 
ice maybe drawn off as required. In 
addition, a broad spatula, about fou 
inches long, rounded at the end, an. 
furnished with a long wooden handle, 
is necessary to scrape the frozen cream 
from the sides of the ice-pot, and for 
mixing the whole smoothly together. 
When making ices, place the mixture 
of cream and fruit to be frozen, in the 
ice-pot, cover it with the lid, and put 
the pot in the ice-pail, which proceed 
to fill up with coarsely-pounded ice and 
salt, in the proportion of about one part 
of salt to three of ice ; let the whole re- 
main a few minutes (if covered by a 
blanket, so much the better), then whirl 
the pot briskly by the handle for a few 
minutes, take off the lid, and with the 
spatula scrape the iced cream from the 
sides, mixing the whole smoothly; put 
on the lid arid whir) again, repeating 
all the operations every few minutes 
until the whole of the cream is well 
frozen. Great care and considerable 
labour are required in stirring, eo that 
the whole cream may be smoothly 
frozen, and not in hard lumps. When 
finished, if it is required to be kept any 
time, the melted ice and salt should be 
allowed to escape by removing the 
cork, and the pail filled up with fresh 
materials. It is scarcely necessary to 
add, that if any of the melted ice and 
salt is allowed to mix with the crearr 
the latter is spoiled. From the diffi- 
culty of obtaining ice in places distant 
from large towns, and in hot countries, 
and from the impracticability of keeping 
it any length of time, or, in fact, of 
keeping small quantities more than a 
few hours, its use is much limited, and 
many have been the attempts to obtain 
an efficient substitute. For this pur 
I pose various saits have been employed 



NONE SO GOOD AS THEY SHOULD BE. 



which, when dissolved in water or in 
acid.s, absorb a sufficient amount ol'heat 
to freeze substances with which they 
may be placed a. contact. We shall 
not attempt in this article to describe 
all the various freezing mixtures that 
have been devised, but speak only of 
those which have been fon&d practically 
useful, state the circumstances which 
hav? prevented any of them, coming 
intc common use, and conclude by 
giving the composition of the New 
Freezing Preparation, which is now 
exported so largely to India, and the 
Composition of which has hitherto never 
been made public. Many of the freezing 
mixtures which are to be found de- 
scribed in books, are incorrectly so 
named, for although they themselves 
become colder than freezing, yet they 
are not sufficiently powerful to freeze 
any quantity of water, or other sub- 
stances, when placed in a vessel within 
them. In order to be efficient as a 
freezing mixture, as distinguished from 
a cooling one, the materials used ought 
to be capable of producing by them- 
selves an amount of cold more than 
thirty degrees below the freezing point 
of water, and this the ordinary mix- 
tures will not do. Much more efficient 
and really freezing mixtures may be 
made by using acids to dissolve the 
salts. The cheapest, and perhaps the 
best, of these for ordinary use, is one 
which is frequently employed in 
France, both for making dessert ice's, and 
cooling wines, &c. It consists of coarse- 
ly-powdered Glauber salt (sulphate of 
soda), on which is poured about 
two thirds its weight of spirits of salts 
(luuriatic acid). The mixture should 
DC made in a wooden vessel, as that is 
preferable to one made of metal, which 
conducts the external heat to the ma- 
terials with great rapidity ; and when 
the substance to be cooled is placed in 
the mixture, the whole should be 
covered with a blanket, a piece of old 
woollen carpet doubled, or some other 
non-conducting material, to prevent 
the access of the external warmth ; the 
vesse. used for icing wines she old not 



be too large, that there may be n& 
waste of the freezing mixture. This 
combination produces a degree of cold 
thirty degrees below freezing ; and if 
the materials are bought at any of the 
wholesale druggists or drysalters, it is 
exceedingly economical. It is open, 
however, to the very great objection, 
that the muriatic acid is an exceedingly 
corrosive liquid, and of a pungent, disa- 
greeable odour ; this almost precludes 
its use for any purposes except that of 
icing wines. 

Another substance, which is free 
from any corrosive action or unpleas- 
ant odour, is the nitrate of ammonia, 
which, if simply dissolved in rather 
less than its own weight of water, re- 
duces the temperature to about twenty- 
five degrees below freezing. The ob- 
jections to its use are, that its frigorific 
power is not sufficiently great to freeze 
readily ; and if it is required to form 
dessert ices, it is requisite to renew the 
process at the expiration of a quarter 
of an hour, a second, or even, if the 
weather is very hot, and the water 
used is rather warm, a third or fourth 
time. Again, the nitrate of ammonia is 
a very expensive salt ; even in France, 
where it is manufactured expressly for 
this purpose, it is sold at the rate of 
three francs a pound ; and in this 
country it cannot be obtained under 
a much higher price. One great re- 
commendation, however, attends its 
use, namely, that it may be recovered 
again, and "used any number of times, 
by simply boiling away the water in 
which it is dissolved by a gentle fire, 
until a small portion, on being remov- 
ed, crystallizes on cooling. 

If, however, nitrate of ammonia in 
coarse powder is put into the cooler, 
and there is then added twice its weight 
of freshly-crushed washing soda, and 
an equal quantity of the coldest watef 
that can be obtained, an intensely 
powerful frigorific mixture is the re 
suit, the cold often falling to forty 
degrees below freezing. This is by far 
the most efficacious freezing mixture 
that can be made without the use of 



MAN I OUBLES HIS EVILS BY BROODING UPON THEM. 



81 



ice or acids. But, unfortunately, it 
lias an almost insuperable objection, 
that the nitrate of ammonia is decom- 
posed by the soda, and cannot be re- 
covered by evaporation ; this rises the 
expense to BO great a height, that the 
plan is practically useless*

these objections,

It is easy of use,

most lively interest. It consists of two 
powders, the first of which is composed 
of one part by weight of muriate of am- 
monia, or sal-ammoniac powder, and 
intimately mixed with two parts by 
weight of nitrate of potash, or saltpetre. 
These quantities are almost exactly in 
(what is called by chemists) the com- 
bining proportions of the two salts, and 
by reacting on each other, the original 
compounds are destroyed, and in the 
place of muriate of ammonia and nitrate 
of potash, we have nitrate of ammonia 
and muriate of potash ; thus we liavr 
succeeded in producing nitrate oi'aumio- 
nia at a. cheap rate, accompanied by an- 
other salt, the muriate of potash, which 
also produces considerable cold when 
dissolved ; but this mixture used alone 
cannot be regarded as a freezing one, 
although very efficient in cooling. 
The other powder is formed simply 
of the best soda, crushed, in a mor- 
tar, or by passing through a mill ; 
although, as hitherto prepared, its ap- 
pearance has been disguised by the 
admixture of small quantities of other 
materials, which have, however, tend- 
ed to diminish its efficacy. The two 
powders so prepared must be sepa- 
rately kept in closely-covered vessels, 
and "in as cool a place as possible ; for 
if the crushed soda is exposed to the 



attracts moisture from the air, and dis- 
solves in it becoming useless. To 
use the mixture, take an equal bulk of 
the two powders, mix them together 
by stirring, and immediately introduce 
them into the ice-pail, or vessel in 
which they are to be dissolved, and 
pour on as much water (the coldest 
that can be obtained) as is sufficient to 
dissolve them ; if a pint measure of each 
of the powders is used, they will require 
about a pint of water to dissolve them. 
More water than is necessary should 
not be used, as in that case the addi- 
tion al water is cooled instead of the 
substance that it is wished . to freeze 
Less than a pint of each powder, and 
about the same quantity of water, will 
be found sufficient to ice two bottles 
of wine, one after the other, in the hot- 
test of weather, if a tub is used of such 
a size as to prevent the waste of mate- 
rials. 

If the ordinary sal-ammoniac of the 
shops is used, it will be found both 
difficult to powder, and expensive ; in 
fact, it is so exceedingly tough, that 
the only way in which it can be easily 
divided, except in a drug mill, is by 
putting- as large a quantity of the salt 
into water which is actually boiling as 
the latter will dissolve ; as the solution 
cools, the salt crystallizes out in the 
solid form, and if stirred as it cools, it 
separates in a state of fine division. As 
tins process is troublesome, and as the 
sal-ammoniac is expensive, it is better 
to use the crude muriate of ammonia, 
which is the same substance as sal- 
ammoniac, but before it has been puri- 
fied by sublimation. This is not usually 
kept by druggists, but may be readily 
obtained of any of the artificial manure 
merchants, at a very moderate rate; 
and its purity may be readily tested by 
placing a portion of it on a red-hot iron, 
when it should fly off in a vapour, leav- 
ing scarcely any residue. 

It is hardly necessary to add, that 
in icing wines, or freezing, the effect is 



air, it loses the water it contains, and great in proportion to the coldness of 
is considerably weakened in power ; j the materials used; therefore, every 
and if the other mixture is exposed, it j article employed, viz., the water, tub*

mixtures, &c., should be as cool as pos- 
sible. 

24-2. RECIPES FOR THE MANU- 
FACTURE OF DESSERT ICES, 
BOTH CREAM AND WATER. 

243. STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 
Take one pint of strawberries, one pint 
of cream, nearly half a pound of pow- 
dered white sugar, the juice of a lemon ; 
mash the fruit through a sieve, and 
take out the seeds : mix with the other 
articles, and freeze : a little new milk 
added makes the whole freeze more 
quickly. 

244. RASPBERRY ICE CREAM. 
The same as strawberry. These ices 
are often coloured by cochineal, but the 
addition is not advantageous to the 
flavour. Strawberry or raspberry jam 
may be used instead of the fresh fruit, 
or equal quantities of jam and fruit 
employed. Of course the quantity of 
sugar must be proportionately dimin- 
ished. 

245. STRAWBERRY-WATER ICE. 
One large pottle of scarlet strawberries, 
the juice of a lemon, a pound of sugar, 
or one pint of strong syrup, half a pint 
of water. Mix, first rubbing the fruit 
through a sieve, and freeze. 

246^ RASPBERRY- WATER ICE in the 
same manner. 

247. LEMON- WATER ICE. Lemon 
juice and water, each half a pint; 
strong syrup, one pint ; the rind of the 
lemons should be rasped off before 
squeezing with lump sugar, which is to 
be added to the juice ; mix the whole ; 
strain after standing an hour, and freeze. 
Beat up with a little sugar the whites 
of two or three eggs, and as the ice is 
beginning to set, work this in with the 
spatula, which will much improve the 
consistence and taste. 

248. ORANGE- WATER ICE in the 
same way. 

249. FURTHER DIRECTIONS. Ac- 
tual quantities one pound of muriate 

f ammonia, or sal ammoniac, finely 
t> vwdered, is to be intimately mixed 
with two pounds of nitrate of potash or 
saltpetre, also in powder , this mixture 
we may call No. 1. No 2 is formed 



by crushing three pounds of the best 
soda. In use, an equal bulk of both 
No. 1 and No. 2 is to be taken, stirred 
together, placed in the ice-pail sur- 
rounding the ice-pot, and rather lesa 
cold water poured on than will dissolve 
the whole; if one quart of No. 1, and 
the same bulk of No. 2 are taken, it 
will require about one quart of water 
to dissolve them, and the temperature 
will fall, if the materials used are cool, 
to nearly thirty degrees below freezing. 
Those who fail may trace their want of 
success to one or other of the following 
points : the use of too small a quantity 
of the preparation ; the employment of 
a few ounces; whereas, in freezing 
ices, the ice-pot must be entirely sur- 
rounded with the freezing material: 
no one would attempt to freeze with 
four ounces of ice and salt. Again, too 
large a quantity of water may be used 
to dissolve the preparation, when all 
the excess of water has to be cooled 
down instead of the substance it is 
wished to freeze. All the materials 
used should be pure, and as cool as can 
be obtained. The ice-pail in which 
the mixture is made must be of some 
non - conducting material, as wood, 
which will prevent the access of warmth 
from the air ; and the ice-pot, in which 
the liquor to be frozen is placed, should 
be of pewter, and surrounded nearly to 
its top by the freezing mixture. Bear 
in mind that the makiDg of ice-cream, 
under any circumstances, is an opera- 
tion requiring considerable dexterity 
and practice. 

250. THE ART OF BEING 
AGREEABLE. The true art of be- 
ing agreeable is to appear well pleased 
with all the company, and rather to 
seem well entertained with them than 
to bring entertainment to them. A 
man thus disposed, perhaps, may not 
have much learning, nor any wit ; but 
if he has common sense, and something 
friendly in his behaviour, it conciliates 
men's minds more than the brightest 
parts without this disposition ; and 
when a man of such a turn comes to 
old age, he is almost sure to be treated 



KEEP ON GOOD TERMS WITH TOUR WIFE, TOUR STOMACH, AND YOUR CONSCIENCE. 83 



with respect. It is true, indeed, that 
we should not I'.ssemble and flatter in 
company : but a man may be very 
agreeable, strictly consistent with truth 
and sincerity, by a prudent silence 
where he cannot concur, and a pleasing 
assent where he can. Now and then 
you meet with a person so exactly 
formed to | lease, that he will gain upon 
every one that hears or beholds him ; 
this disposition is not merely the gift of 
nature, but frequently the effect of 
much knowledge of the world, and a 
command over the passions. 

251. DESTRUCTION OF RATS. 
The following recipe for the destruc- 
tion of rats has been communicated by 
Dr. Ure to the council of the English 
Agricultural Society, and is highly re- 
commended as the best know r n means 
of getting rid of these most obnoxious 
and destructive vermin. It has been 
tried by several intelligent persons, 
and found perfectly effectual. Melt 
hog's lard in a bottle plunged in water, 
heated to about 150 degrees of Fah- 
renheit ; introduce into it half an ounce 
of phosphorus for every pound of lard ; 
then add a pint of proof-spirit or whis- 
key; cork the bottle firmly after its 
contents have been heated to 150 de- 
grees, taking it at the same time out of 
the water, and agitate smartly till the 
phosphorus becomes uniformly diffused, 
forming a milky-looking liquid. This 
liquid being cooled, will afford a white 
compound of phosphorus and lard, from 
which the spirit spontaneously sepa- 
rates, and may be poured off to be used 
again, for none of it enters into the 
combination, but it merely serves to 
comminute the phosphorus, and dif- 
fuse it in very fine particles through 
the lard. This compound, on being 
warmed very gently, may be poured 
out into a mixture of wheat flour and 
sugar, incorporated therewith, and then 
flavoured with oil of rhodium, or not, 
at pleasure. The flavour may be varied 
with oil of aniseed, &c. This dough, 
being made into pellets, is to be laid 
in rat-holes. By its lurninousness in 
the dark, it attracts th ; .r notice, and 
4* 



being agreeable to their palates and 
noses, it is readily eaten, and proves 
certainly fatal. 

25-2. ALMOND PUDDING AND 
SAUCE. A large cupful of finely- 
minced beef suet, a teacupful of milk, 
four ounces of bread-crumbs, four 
ounces of well-cleaned currants, two 
ounces of almonds, half a pound ot 
stoned raisins, three well-beaten eggs, 
and the whites of other J;wo: sugar, 
nutmeg, and cinnamon, and a small 
glass of rum. Butter a shape, and 
place part of the raisins neatly in rows. 
Blanche the almonds ; reserve the half 
of them to be placed in rows between 
the raisins just before serving. Mix 
all the remaining ingredients well to- 
gether, put into the ehape, and boil 
three hours. The Sauce One tea- 
spoonful of milk, and two yolks of eggs 
well beaten, and some sugar ; place on 
the fire and stir till it just comes to the 
boil; then let it cool. When luke- 
warm, stir it into a glass of sherry or 
currant wine, and serve in a sauce tur- 
een. This sauce is a great improve- 
ment to the raisin pudding. 

253. STEWED WATER-CRESS. 
The following receipt may be new, 
and will be found an agreeable and 
wholesome dish : Lay the cress in 
strong salt and water, to clear it from 
insects. Pick and wash nicely, and 
stew it in w r ater for about tfcn minutes ; 
drain and chop, season with pepper and 
salt, add a little butter, and return it 
to the stew-pan until well heated. Add 
a little vinegar first before serving; 
put around it sippets of toast or fried 
bread. The above, made thin, as a 
substitute for parsley and butter, wll 
be found an excellent covering for a 
boiled fowl. There should be more of 
the cress considerably than of the pars- 
ley, as the flavour is much milder. 

254. TO LOOSEN GLASS STOP- 
PERS OF BOTTLES. (See 3063.) 
With a feather rub a drop or two of 
salad oil round the stopper, close to the 
mouth of the bottle or decanter, which 
must be then placed before the fire, at 
the distance of about eighteen inches 



84 



IF Y3U COVET PRAISE, YOU DON'T DESKRTE IT. 



the heat will cause the oil to insinuate 
itself between the stopper and the 
neck. When the battle or decanter 
has grown warm, gently strike the 
stopper on one side, and then on the 
other, with any light wooden instru- 
ment; then try it with the hand ; it' it 
will not yet move, place it again before 
the fire, adding another drop of oil. 
After a while strike again as before ; 
and, by persevering in this process, 
however tightly it may be fastened in, 
you will at length succeed in loosening 
it. This is decidedly the best plan. 

255. ECONOMICAL FAMILY 
PUDDING. Bruise with a wooden 
spoon, through a colander, six large or 
twelve middle-sized boiled potatoes ; 
beat four eggs, mix with a pint of good 
milk, stir in the potatoes ; sugar and 
seasoning to taste ; butter a dish ; bake 
half an hour. This receipt is simple 
and economical, as it is made of what 
is wasted in most families, viz. cold 
potatoes, which may be kept two or 
three days, till a sufficient quantity is 
collected. It is a weekly dish at our 
table. A teaspoonful of chip marma- 
lade makes a delicious seasoning. 

256. PARSNIP WINK Take fif- 
teen pounds of sliced parsnips, and boil 
until quite soft in five gallons of water ; 
squeeze the liquor well out of them, 
run it through a sieve, and add three 
pounds of coarse lump sugar to every 
gallon of liquor. Boil the whole for 
three-quarters of an hour. When it is 
nearly cold, add a little yeast on toast. 
Let it remain in a tub for ten days, 
stirring it from the bottom every day ; 
then put it into a cask for a year. As 
it works over, fill it up every day. 

257. TURNIP WINE. Take a 
large number of turnips, pare and slice 
them ; then place them in a cider-press, 
and obtain all the juice you can. To 
every gallon of juice add three pounds 
of lump sugar, and half a pint of brandy. 
Pour into a ?ask, but do not bung until 
it has done working; then bung it 
close for three months, and draw off 
into another cask- when it is fin 3. 
bottle, and cork wed. 



258. CASH AND CREDIT. If 

you would get rich, don't deal in bill 
books. Credit is the " tempter in a 
new shape." Buy goods on trust, and 
you. will purchase a thousand articles 
that Jash would never have dreamed 
of. A shilling in the hand looks larger 
than ten shillings seen through the per 
spective of a three months' bill. Cash 
is practical, while Credit takes horribly 
to taste and romance. Let Cash buy a 
dinner, and you will have a beef-steak 
flanked with onions. Send Credit to 
market, and he will return with eight 
pairs of woodcocks and a peck of mush- 
rooms. Credit believes in diamond 
pins and champagne suppers. Cash is 
more easily satisfied. Give him three 
meals a day, and he don't care much if 
two of them are made up of roasted 
potatoes and a little dirty salt. Cash 
is a good adviser, while Credit is a 
good fellow to be on visiting terms 
with. If you want double chins and 
contentment, do business with Cash. 

259. WHY THE WEDDING-RING 
IS PLACED ON THE FOURTH 
FINGER. We have remarked on the 
vulgar error of a vein g^oing from the 
fourth finger of the lett hand to the 
heart. It is said by Swinbum and 
others that, therefore, it became the 
wedding-finger. The priesthood kept 
up this idea by still keeping it as the 
wedding-finger ,but it was got at through 
the use of the Trinity ; for, in the 
ancient ritual of English marriages, the 
ring was placed by the husband on the 
top of the thumb of the left hand, with 
the words " In the name of the 
Father;" he then removed it to the 
forefinger, saying, " In the name of the 
Son ;" then to the middle finger, add 
ng, "And of the Holy Ghost;" finally, 
lie left it as now, on the fourth finger, 
with the closing word, " Amen." The 
History and Poetry of Finger-rings. 

260. A ROMAN LADY'S TOILET. 
The toilet of a Roman lady involved 
an elaborate and very costly process. 
It commenced at night, when the face, 
supposed to have been tarnished bv 

xposure, was overlaid with a poultice 



AN ACT IS BETTEB THAN A WORD. 



85 



composed of boiled or moistened Hour 
spread on with the fingers. Poppsean 
unguents sealed the lips, and the lady 
was profusely rubbed with Cerona 
ointment. In die morning, the poultice 
and unguents were washed off', a bath 
of asses' milk imparted a delicate 
whiteness to the skin, and the pale face 
was freshened and revived with enamel. 
The full eyelids, which the Roman 
lady still knows so well how to use, 
now suddenly raising them to reveal a 
glance of surprise, or of melting tender- 
ness, now letting them drop like a veil 
over the lustrous eyes, the full 
rounded eyelids were coloured within, 
and .a needle, dipped in jetty dye, gave 
length and sphericity to the eyebrows. 
The forehead was encircled by a 
wreath, or fillet, fastened in the luxu- 
riant hair, which rose in front in a 
pyramidal pile, formed of successive 
ranges of curls, and giving the appear- 
ance of more than ordinary height. 

261. METHOD OF CLEANING 
PAPER-HANGINGS. Cut into eight 
half-quarters a quartern loaf, two days 
old ; it must neither be newer nor 
staler. With one of these pieces, after 
having blown off all the dust from the 
paper to be cleaned, by the means of 
a good pair of bellows, begin at the top 
of the room, holding- the crust in the 
hand, and wiping lightly downward 
with the crum, about half a yard at each 
stroke, till the upper part of the hang- 
ings is completely cleaned all round. 
Then go round again, with the like 
sweeping stroke downwards, always 
commencing each successive course a 
little higher than the upper stroke had 
extended, till the bottom be finished. 
This operation, if carefully performed, 
will frequently make very old paper 
took almost equal to new. Great cau- 
tion must be used not by any means to 
rub the paper hard, nor to attempt 
cleaning it the cross or horizontal way. 
The dirty part of the bread, too, must 
be each time cut away, and the pieces 
renewed as soon as it may become ne- 
cessary. 

262* T) PREVENT MOTHS. 



In the month of April or May, beat 
your fur garments well with a small 
cane or elastic stick, then lap them up 
in linen, without pressing the fur too 
hard, and put betwixt the folds some 
camphor in small lumps; then put 
your furs in this state in boxes well 
closed. When the furs are wanted for 
use, beat them well as before, and ex- 
pose them for twenty-four hours to the 
air, which will take aw r ay the smell of 
the camphor. If the fur has long hair, 
as bear or fox, add to the camphor an 
equal quantity of black pepper in 
powder. 

263. GERMAN YEAST. We have 
repeatedly noticed the fatality of late 
of attacks of carbuncles, and the preva- 
lence of diseases of that nature, which 
w r e were disposed to attribute to the 
state of the atmosphere, and as arising 
from much the same cause as the visi- 
tation of cholera. A correspondent, 
however, has thrown some light upon 
the subject, and we print his statement 
in the hope that the baking fraternity 
will be prohibited by law from using 
the pernicious stuff mentioned. We 
are protected from the sale of diseased 
and poisonous meat, and from the adul- 
teration of flour, beer and other articles, 
and it is absolutely necessary now that 
we should be protected from German 
yeast. Our correspondent says : " Per- 
haps not the least important matter on 
the subject of cookery is to avoid every- 
thing calculated to injure the purity of 
the family bread, whether prepared at 
home or in the baker's oven, and that 
this is done to a great extent (although 
unconsciously) will be at once apparent 
from the following statement of facts, 
upon which the public require to be 
informed. It is well known that a very 
large proportion of the bread prepared 
for family use is raised from what is 
called German yeast a noxious com- 
pound imported weekly into Hull in 
quantities really astounding, and where, 
I am credibly informed, tons of it ar* 
thrown into the sea from having become 
alive ; yet this is used by the great ma- 
jority of bakers over the kingdom to 



86 



GOOD NATDUE COLLECTS HONEY FROM EVERY 11EKK. 



produce the bread for our vast popula- 
tion, who little suspect the slow poison 
they are daily and unconsciously con- 
suming, and to which, from discussions 
in medical societies, and notices in 
medical journals, it seems extremely 
probable that the numerous cases of 
carbuncles and boils, which, within 
these few years, have proved of so seri- 
i .UK aud even fatal a character, may 
i\ve their origin. It ought to be gener- 
ally known that this German yeast is 
prepared from every species of refuse 
grain, and especially (where they can 
obtain it) from, that which is wholly 
unfit for the food of either man or beast, 
and if in a state of positive putrefaction, 
so much the more valuable it is for 
their purpose, running the more rapidly 



and easily into fermentation." 
264. HOW TO MAKE 



SEA- 



WATER. There cannot be a question 
that by far the simplest plan would 
consist in the evaporation of the sea- 
water itself in large quantities, preserv- 
ing the resulting salt in closely-stopped 
vessels to prevent the absorption of 
moisture, and vending it in this form to 
the consumer; the proportion of this 
dry saline matter being fifty- six ounces 
to ten gallon s of water, less three pints. 
This plan was suggested by Dr. E. 
Schweitzer, for the extemporaneous 
formation of sea-water for medicinal 
baths. Mr. H. Schweitzer writes me 
that he has for many years made this 
compound, in accordance with his 
cousin's analysis. The proportion or- 
dered to be used is six ounces to the 
gallon of water, and stirred well until 
dissolved. 

265. HOW TO TAKE CARE OF 
YOUR HAT. If your hat is wet, 
shake it out as much as possible ; then 
brush it with a soft brush as smooth as 
you can, or with a clean linen cloth or 
'handkerchief; wipe it very carefully, 
keep the beaver flat aud smooth, in the 
same direction as it was first placed ; 
then, with a small cane, beat the nap 
gently up, and hang it up to dry in a 
,?ool place. When it is dry, lay it on a 



with a soft brush in the proper direc- 
tion ; and you will find your hat not the 
least injured by the rain. If the gloss 
is not quite so high as you wish, take a 
flat iron, moderately heated, and pass 
the same two or three times gently 
over the hat ; brush it afterwards and 
it will become nearly as handsome as 
when sent home from the maker. To 
Scour a Hat ichcn the Nap is Clotted, 
and to take Salt Water out. Get a hard 
brush, a basin of hot water (boiling), 
and some yellow soap ; rub a little of 
the soap lightly on the brush and dip it 
into the water: brush the hat round 
with the nap. If you find the nap clot- 
ted, do not scrape it with your fingers, 
as that tears it off, but brush it until it 
is smooth, and the soap is thoroughly 
out; then take a piece of w r ood, or the 
back of a knife, and scrape it well 
round ; you will find all the dirt come 
out ; then beat it gently with a cane. 

266. CURE FOR BURNS. Of 
all applications for a burn, we believe 
that there are none equal to a simple 
covering of common wheat-flour. This 
is always at hand ; and while it requires 
no skill in using, it produces most 
astonishing effects. The moisture pro- 
duced upon the surface of a slight or 
deep burn is at once absorbed by the 
flour, and forms a paste which shuts 
out the air. As long- as the fluid mat- 
ters continue flowing, they are absorb- 
ed and prevented from producing irrita- 
tion, as they would do, if kept from 
passing off by oily or resinous applica- 
tions ; while the greater the amount of 
those absorbed by the flour, the thicker 
the protective covering. Another ad- 
vantage of the flour covering' is that 
next to the surface it is kept moist and 
flexible. It can also be readily washed 
off, without further irritation in remov- 
ing. It may occasionally be washed 
oft' very carefully, when it has become 
matted and dry, and a new covering b 
sprinkled on. 

267. CARE OF LINEN. Whec 
linen is well dried and laid by for us* 
nothing more is necessary than to sc- 



tnble, and brush it round several times ' cure it from damp and insects

latter may be agreeably performed by 
a judicious mixture of aromatic shrubs 
and fl :wers, cut up and sewed up in 
silkeL. bags, to be intersperse^ among 
the dn \vers and shelves. The&o ingre- 
dients may consist of lavender, thyme, 
roses, cedar shavings, powdered sassa- 
fras, cassia lignea, &c., into which a few 
drops of otto of roses, or other strong- 
scented perfume, may bo thrown. In 
all cases, it will be fuiind more consist- 
ent with economy to examine and re- 
pair all washable articles, more espe- 
cially linen, that may stand in need of 
it, previous to sending them to the 
laundry. It will also be prudent to 
have every article carefully numbered, 
and so arranged, after w y ashing, as to 
have their regular turn and term in 
domestic use. 

268. HAIR OILS. ROSE OIL. 

Olive oil, one pint ; otto of roses, five 

. to sixteen drops. Essence of bergamot 

being much cheaper, is usually used 

instead of the more expensive otto of

270. HAIR DYE. A friend of ours, 
to whom we applied upon the subject, 
favoured us with the following- infor- 
mation : I have operated upon my 
own cranium for at least a dozen years, 
and though I have heard it affirmed 
that dyeing the hair will produce insan- 
ity, I am happy to think I am, as yet, 
perfectly sane, and under no fear of 
being otherwise ; at all events, I am 
wiser than I once was, when I paid five 
shillings for what I can now make my- 
self for less than twopence ! but to the 
question : I procure lime, which I 
speedily reduce to powder by throwing 
a little water upon it, then mix this 
with litharge (three quarters lime, and 
a quarter litharge), which I sift through 
a fine hair sieve, and then 1 have what 
is sold at a h'gli price under the name 
>i' ' Unique Powder" and the irist 



effectual harr dye that has yet been 
discovered. But the application of it 
is not very agreeable, though simple 
enough : Put a quantity of it in a 
saucer, pour boiling water upon it. and 
mix it up with a knife like thick mus- 
tard; divide the hair into thin layers, 
with a comb, and plaster the mixture 
thickly into the layers to the roots, and 
all over the hair. When it is all com- 
pletely covered over with it, then lay 
all over it a covering of damp blue, or 
brown paper, then bind over it, closely, 
a handkerchief, then put on a nightcap 
over all, and go to bed ; in the morning, 
brush out the powder, wash thoroughly 
with soap and warm water, then dry, 
curl, oil, &c. I wan-ant that hair thus 
managed will be a permanent and beau- 
tiful black, which, I dare say, most 
people would prefer to either gray or 
red. Now, notwithstanding the patient 
endurance and satisfactory experience 
of our friend, we very much doubt, 
whether one person in a hundred, would 
be content to envelope their heads in 
batter of this description, and then re- 
tire to rest. To rest! did we say? 
We envy not the slumbers enjoyed 
under these circumstances. Wo fancy 
we can do something still better for 
those who are ashamed of their gray 
hairs. The hair-dyes formerly used 
produced very objectionable tints. Lat- 
terly several perfumers have been sell- 
ing dyes, consisting of two liquids to be 
used in succession, at exceedingly hi^h 
prices. The composition has been kept 
a close secret in the hands of a few. 
The procuring of it for publication in 
this work has been attended with con 
siderable difficulty, biit our readers may 
take it as an earnest that no pains or 
expense will be spared to render really 
useful information. 

271. HAIR DYE, USUALLY STYLEI* 
COLOMBIAN, ARGENTINE, &c., &c.- 
Solution No. I. Hydrosulphurct of am- 
monia, one ounce ; solution of potash, 
three drachms ; distilled, or tain water, 
one ounce (all by measure). Mix, and 
put into small bottles, labelling it No,

one drachm ; distilled, or rain-water, two 
ounces. Dissolved and labelled No. II. 

Directions. The solution No. I. is 
first applied to the hair with a tooth 
brush, and the application continued 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. The 
solution No., II. is then brushed over, 
a comb being used to separate the 
hairs, and allow the liquid to come in 
contact with every part. Care must 
be taken that the liquid do not conle 
in contact with the skin, as the solu- 
tion No. II. produces a very permanent 
dark stain on all substances with which 
it comes in contact. If the shade is 
not sufficiently deep, the operation may 
be repeated. The hair should be 
cleaned from grease before using the 
dye. 

To try the effect of hair-dye upon 
hair of any colour, cut off a lock and 
apply the dye thoroughly as directed 
above. This will be a guarantee of 
success, or will at least guard against 
failure. 

272. BUG POISON. Proof spirit, 
one pint ; camphor, two ounces ; oil of 
turpentine, four ounces ; corrosive sub- 
limate, one ounce. Mix. 

273. TO MAKE A FAC-SIMILE 
OF A LEAF IN COPPER. This 
beautiful experiment can be performed 
by any person in possession of a com- 
mon galvanic battery. The process is 
as follows: Soften a piece of gutta 
percha over a candle, or before a fire ; 
knead it with the moist fingers upon a 
table, until the surface is perfectly 
smooth, and large enough to cover the 
leaf to be copied ; lay the leaf flat upon 
the surface, and press every part well 
into the gutta percha. In about five 
minutes the leaf may be removed, when 
if the operation has* been carefully per- 
formed a perfect impression of the leai 
will be made on the gutta percha. 
This must now be attached to the wire 
in connexion with the zinc end of the 
battery (which can easily be done by 
heating the end of the wire, and press- 
ing it into the gutta percha), dusted 
well over with the best black lead, with 
a camel's hair brush the Oj?ct of 



which is to render it a conductor of 
slectricity and then completely im- 
mersed in a saturated solution of eul- 
phate of copper. A piece of copper 
attached to the wire in connexion with 
;he copper end of the battery, must als* 
je inserted into the copper solution, 
acing the gutta percha but not touch- 
ng it; this not only acts as a conductor 
to the electricity, but also maintains the 
solution of copper of a permanent 
strength. In a short time, the copper 
will be found to creep over the whole 
surface of the gutta percha, and in about 
twenty-four hours, a thick deposit of 
copper will be obtained, which may 
then be detached from the mould. The 
accuracy with which a loaf may thus 
be cast is truly surprising 1 . I have in 
my possession a cast of a hazel-leaf 
made by the process, which nobody 
would take to be a production of art ; 
every fibre and nerve, in fact, the mi- 
nutest part, is delineated with the ut- 
most fidelity. 

274. GOLDFISH. Great care must 
be taken of gold fish, as they are very 
susceptible ; and hence a loud noise, 
strong smell, violent or even slight 
shaking of the vessel, will ofttimes de- 
stroy them. Small worms, which are 
common to the water, suffice for their 
food in general ; but the Chinese, who 
bring gold fish to great perfection, 
throw small balls of paste into the 
water, of which they are very fond. 
They give them also lean pork, dried 
in the sun, and reduced to a very fine 
and delicate powder. Fresh river-water 
must be given them every day. Care 
must be taken to collect the spawn, 
when seen floating on the water, as 
otherwise it will be destroyed by the 
fish themselves. This spawn is put 
into a vessel, and exposed to the sun, 
until vivified by the heat. Gold fish, 
however, seldom deposit spawn when 
kept in vases. In order to procure a 
supply, they must be put into reser- 
voirs of a considerable depth, in some 
parts at least, well shaded at intervals 
with water-lilies, and constantly sup- 
pi; =}d with fresh w r ater. At a certain

time of the year, numerous barques are | 
Been in the great river of Yaugft-se- 
Keang, which go thither to purchase 
the spawn of gold fish. This is ob- 
tained with no small care, for towards 
the month of May, the inhabitants 
close the river in several places with 
mats and hurdles, which extend nine 
or ten leagues, and leave only a space 
in the middle sufficient for the passage 
of boats. The spawn is stopped by 
these hurdles, and the water being 
afterwards drawn up, and put into 
large vessels, is sold to merchants, who 
send it to all parts. 

275. METHOD OF HARDENING 
OBJECTS IN PLASTER OF PA- 
RIS. Take two parts of stearine, two 
parts of Venetian soap, one part of pearl- 
ash, and twenty-four to thirty parts of a 
solution of caustic potash. The stearine 
and soap are cut into slices, mixed with 
the cold ley, and boiled for about half 
an hour, being constantly stirred. 
Whenever the mass rises, a little cold 
ley is added. The pearlash, previously 
moistened with a little rain water, is 
then added, and the whole boiled for a 
few minutes. The mass is then stirred 
until cold, when it is mixed with so 
much cold ley that it becomes perfectly 
liquid, and runs off the spoon without 
coagulating and contracting. Before 
using this composition, it should be 
kept for several days well covered. 
It may be preserved for years. Be- 
fore applying it to the objects, they 
should be well dusted, the stains 
scraped away, and then coated, by 
means of a thick brush, with the wash, 
as long as the plaster of Paris absorbs 
it, and left to dry. The coating is then 
dusted with leather, or a soft brush. 
If the surface has not become shining-, 
the operation must be repeated. 

276. CUP IN A PIE-DISH. The 
custom of placing an inverted cup in a 
fruit pie, the cook will inform us, is to 
contain the juice while the pie is bak- 
ing in the oven, and prevent its boiling 
over; and she is the more convinced 
in her theo ry, because, when the pie is 
withdrawn from the oven, the cup will 



be found full of juice. When the cup 
is first put in the dish it is full of cold 
air, and, when the pie is placed in the 
oven this air will expand by the beat 
and nil the cup, and drive out all the 
juice and a portion of the present air 
It contains, in which state it will remain 
until removed from the oven, when the 
air in the cup will condense, and occupy 
a very small space, leaving the re- 
mainder to be filled with juice ; but 
this does not take place till the danger 
of the juice boiling over is passed. If 
a small glass tumbler is inverted in the 
pie, its contents Cftn be examined into 
while it is in the oven, and it will be 
found what has been advanced is cor- 
rect. 

277. TO REMOVE INK-STAINS 
FROM SILVER. The tops and other 
portions of silver inkstands frequently 
become deeply discoloured with ink, 
which is difficult to remove by ordi- 
nary means. It may, however, be com- 
pletely eradicated by making a little 
chloride of lime into a paste with water, 
and rubbing it upon the stains. Chlo- 
ride of lime has been misnamed " The 
general bleacher," but it is a foul ene- 
my to all metallic surfaces. 

278. PARISIAN ETIQUETTE. 
Many of our readers may be visiting 

Paris, and to such persons the follow- 
ing hints will be useful : 

INTRODUCTION TO SOCIETY. 

Avoid all extravagance and manner- 
ism, and not be over-timid at the out- 
set. 

Be discreet and sparing of youi 
words. 

Awkwardness is a great misfortune, 
but it is not an unpardonable fault. 

To deserve the reputation of moving 
in good society, something more is re- 
quisite than the avoidance of blunt 
rudeness. 

Strictly keep tc your engagements. 

Punctuality is the essence of royal 
politeness. 

THE TOILET. 

Too much attention cannot be paiJ 
to the arrangements of the toilet. 



90 



THE SWEETEST ROSE GROWS UPON THE SHARPEST THORN'S. 



A man is often judged by his appear 
ance, and seldom incorrectly. 

A neat exterior, equally free from ex- 
travagance and poverty, almost ahvay 
proclaims a right-minded man. 

To dress appropriately, and with 
good taste, is to respect yourself and 
others. 

A black coat and trowsers are indis- 
pensable for a visit of ceremony, an 
entertainment, or a ball. 

The white or black waistcoat is 
equally proper in these cases. 

The hand should always be gloved. 

A well-bred man always wears yel- 
low kids in dancing. [So says our Pa- 
risian authority : we take exception, 
however, to the ydlow a tint is prefer- 
able to a decided colour!] 

A person of distinction is always 
known by the fineness of his linen, and 
by the nicety of his hat, gloves, and 
boots. [Rather read: fine linen, and 
a good hat, gloves, and boots, are evi- 
dences of the highest taste in dress.] 

A gentleman walking should always 
wear gloves, this being one of the charac- 
teristics of good breeding. 

Upon public and State occasions offi- 
cers should appear in uniform. 

Ladies dresses should be chosen so 
as to produce an agreeable harmony. 

Never put on a dark-coloured bonnet 
with a light spring costume. 

Avoid uniting colours which will 
fmggest an epigram; such as a straw- 
coloured dress with a g-reen bonnet. 

The arrangement of the hair is most 
important, 

Bands are becoming to faces of a 
Grecian caste. 

Ringlets better suit lively and expres- 
sive heads. 

Whatever be your style of face, avoid 
an excess of lace, and let flowers be 
few and choice. 

In a married woman a richer style 
of ornament is admissible. 

Costly elegance for her for the young 
girl, a style of modest simplicity. 

The most e^gant dress loses its char- 
acter if it is. not worn with grace. 

oung girls have often an air of con- 



straint, and their dress seems to par 
take of their want of ease. 

In speaking of her toilet, a woman 
should not conrey the idea that her 
whole skill consists in adjusting taste- 
fully some trifling ornaments. 

A simple style of dress is an indica- 
tion of modesty. 

CLEANLINESS. 

The hands should receive special at- 
tention. They are the outward signs 
of general cleanliness. The same may 
be said of the face, the neck, the ears, 
and the teeth. (See 37, 38, 60, 344, 
145 and 146). 

The cleanliness of the system gene- 
rally, and of bodily apparel, pertains to 
Health, and will be treated of under 
this head. 

THE HANDKERCHIEF. 

There is considerable art in using 
this accessory of dress and comfort. 

Avoid extreme patterns, styles, and 
colours. 

Never be without a handkerchief. 

Hold it freely in the hand, and do not 
roll it into a, ball. Hold it by the centre, 
and let the corners form a fanlike ex- 
pansion. 

Avoid using it too much. "With some 
persons the habit becomes troublesome 
and unpleasant. 

VISITS AND PRESENTATIONS. 

Friendship calls should be made in 
the forenoon, and require neatness, 
without costliness of dress. 

Calls to give invitations to dinner- 
parties, or balls, should be veiy 
hort, and should be paid in the after- 
noon. 

Visits of condolence require a grave 
style of dress. 

A formal visit should never be made 
Before noon. If a second visitor is an 
nounced, it will be proper for you to 
retire, unless you are very intimate, 
both with the host and the visitor an- 
nounced ; unless, indeed, the hoet ex- 
presses a wish for you to remain 

Visits after balls or parties should be 
made within a month. 

In the latter, it is customary to ors 
close your card in an envelope, 



AT NIGHT NATURE IS IN MOURNING FOR THE LOSS OF THE SUN.

the address outside. This may be sent 
by post, if you reside at a distance. 
But, in the neighbourhood, it is polite 
to send your servant, or to call. In the 
latter case a corner should be turned 
down. 

Scrape yom shoes and use the mat. 
Never appear in a drawing-room with 
mud on your boots. 

When a new visitor enters a draw- 
ing-room, if it be a gentleman the ladies 
bow slightly ; if a lady, the guests 
rise. 

Hold your hat in your hand, unless 
requested to place it down. Then lay 
it beside you. 

The last arrival in a drawing-room 
takes a seat left vacant near the mis- 
tress of the house. 

A lady is not required to rise on re- 
ceiving a gentleman, nor to accompany 
him to the door. 

When your visitor retires, ring the 
bell for the servant. You may then 
accompany your guest as far towards 
the door as the circumstances of your 
friendship seem to demand. 

Request the servant, during the visit 
of guests, to be ready to attend to the 
door the moment the bell rings. 

When you introduce a person pro- 
nounce the name distinctly, and say 
whatever you can to make the intro- 
duction agreeable. Such as " an old 
and valued friend," a " school-fellow of 
mine," " an old acquaintance of our 
family." 

Never stare about you in a room as 
if you were taking stock. 

The gloves should not be removed 
during a visit. 

Be hearty in your reception of guests. 
And where you see much diffidence, 
assist the stranger to throw it off. 

A lady does not put her address on 
hnr visiting card. (See 474 and 2345.) 

279. II OR NO H? How MRS. 
HITCHING WAS CURED OF HER HABIT 

OF SPEAKING INCORRECTLY. In the 

evening, after returning home, we were 
Bitting by the fire, and felt comfortable 
ond chatty, when I prop, sed to Mrs. 



Hitching the following Enigma, the 
author of which -had favoured me with 
a copy of it : 

The Vide Vorld you may search, and 

my fellow not find ; 

I dwells in Wacuum, deficient in Vind ; 
In the Wisage I'm seen in the Woice 

I am heard, 
And yet I am inwisible, gives went to 

no Vurd. 
I'm not much of a Vag, for I'm vanting 

in Vit; 
But distinguished in Werse for the 

Wollums I've writ. 
I'm the head of all Willains, yet far 

from the Vurst 
I'm foremost in Wice, tho' in Wirtue 

the first. 
I'm not used to Veapons, and ne'er goes 

to Vor ; 
Though in Walour inwincible in Wic- 

tory sure ; 
The first of all Wiands and Wictuals is 

mine 

Rich in Wenison and Weal, but defi- 
cient in Vine. 

To Wanity given, I in Welwets abound ; 
But in Voman, in Vife, and in Vidow 

ain't found ; 
Yet conspicuous in Wirgins, and I'll tell 

you between us, 
To persons of taste I'm a bit of a 

Weuus ; 
Yet none take me for Veal or for Voe 

in its stead, 
For I ranks not among the sweet Voo'd, 

Vun, and Ved ! 

Before the recital of the enigma was 
half completed Mrs. Hitching laughed 
heartily she saw. of course, the mean- 
ing of it that it was a play upon the 
Cockney error of using the V instead 
of the W, and the latter instead of the 
V. Several times as I proceeded, she 
xclaimed " ^excellent ! ^excellent!" 
and when I had finished, she remarked 
that it was very " /(ingenious," and 
enough to "/topen the Aeyes" of the 
ckneys to their stupid and vulgar 
manner oi speaking. 

A more difficult and delicate task lay 
before me. I told her that as she 



00 TO BED WITU THE LAMB AXD RISE WITH THE LARK. 



was BO much pleased with the firs 
enigma, I would submit anotlier by the 
eaiiie author. I felt very nervous, but 
determined to proceed : 

I dwells in the Herth, and I breathes iu 

the Hair ; 
If you gearches the Hocean, you'll find 

that I'm there. 
The first of all Hangels, in Holympus 

am Hi, 

Yet I'm banished from 'Eaven, expell- 
ed from on 'Igh. 
But, though on this Horb I'm destined 

to grovel, 
I'm ne'er seen in an 'Ouse, in an 'Ut, 

nor an 'Ovel ; 
Not an 'Oss nor an 'Unter e'er bears 

me, alas ! 
But often I'm found on the top of a 

Hass. 
I resides in a Hattic, and loves not to 

roam, 
And yet I'm invariably absent from 

'Ome. 
Tho' 'ushed in the 'Urricane, of the 

Hatmosphere part. 

I enters no 'Ed, I creeps into no 'Art. 
Only look, and you'll see in the Heye I 

appear, 
Only hark, and you'll 'ear me just 

breathe in the Hear ; 
Though in sex not an 'E, I am (strange 

paradox !) 

Not a bit of an 'Efier, but partly a Hox. 
Of Heternity Hi 'm the beginning ! And 

mark, 
Though I goes not with Noar, I'm first 

in th,e Hark. 
I'm never in 'Ealth have with Fysic 

no power ; 
I dies in a month but comes back in a 

Hour ! 

I noticed during the progress of this 
enigma, in reciting which I ventured to 
emphasize the misplaced h's as much 
as possible, that occasional blushes and 
smiles passed over Mr* Hitching' s 
fact After it was finished there was 
A pause of some minutes. At last she 
s*id " Very good, very clever. ' She 



avoided using any word in 
which the h, hard or soft, \v;is required. 
1 e;i\v she wits timid, and I then deter- 
mined to complete the task 1 bad be- 
gun, by repeating the following enigma 
by Byron, upon the same letter : 

T was whispered in heaven, it was 

muttered in hell, 
And echo caught faintly the sound as 

it fell: 
Oi the confines of earth 't was pei-mit- 

ted to rest, 
And the depths of the ocean its presence 

confessed. 
'T will be found in the sphere when 't 

is riven asunder, 
Be seen in the lightning and heard in 

the thunder. 
'Twas allotted to man with his earliest 

breath, 
Attends at his birth, and awaits him in 

death ; 
It presides o'er his happiness, honour, 

and health, 
Is the prop of his house, and the end 

of his w-ealth. 
Without it the soldier and seaman may 

roam, 
But woe to the wretch who expels it 

from home. 
In the whispers of conscience its voice 

will be found; 
Nor e'en in the whirlwind of passion be 

drowned. 
Twill not soften the heart, and tho 

deaf to che ear, 
Twill make It acutely and instantly 

hear. 
But in shade, let it rest like a delicate 

flower 
Oh, breathe on it softly it dies in an 

hour. 

She was much pleased, but seemed 

houghtful, and once or twice in conver 

ation checked herself, and corrected 

ier pronunciation of words that w< rr 

difficult to her. 

A few days afterwards I called upon 
ler, and upon being introduced to tse 
tarloftr to wait for her appearance, 1 
aw lying upon her table the following 



HONEST LOSS IS PREFERABLE TO SHAMEFUL GAIlt.

I am happy to say that it is now a 
pleasure to hear Mrs. Hitching's con- 
versation. I only hope that others may 
improve as she has done. 

280. FEMALE DRESS. It is well 
known that a loose and easy dress con- 
tributes much to give the sex the fine 
proportions of body that are observable 
in the Grecian statues, and which serve 
as models to our present artists, nature 
being too much disfigured among us 
to afford any such. The Greeks knew 
nothing of those Gothic shackles, that 
multiplicity of ligatures and bandages 
with which our bodies are compressed. 
Their women were ignorant of the use 
of whalebone-stays, b^ which ours dis- 
tort their shape instead of displaying it. 
This practice, carried to so great an 
excess as it is in America, must in time 
degenerate the species, and is an in- 
stance of bad taste. Can it be a pleas- 
ant sight to behold a woman cut in two 
in the middle, as it were like a wasp ? On 
the contrary, it is as shocking to the 
eye as it is painful to the imagination. 
A fine shape, like the limb, hath its due 
size and proportion, a diminution of 
which is certainly a defect. Such a 
deformity also would be shocking in a 
naked figure ; wherefore, then, should 
t be esteemed a beauty in one that is 
dressed 1 Everything that confines and 
under a restraint is an in- 



stance of bad taste. This is as true in 
regard to the ornaments of the body as 
to the embellishments of the mind. 
Life, health, reason, and convenience, 
ought to be taken first into considera- 
tion. Gracefulness cannot subsist with- 
out ease ; delicacy is not debility ; nor 
must a woman be sick in order to 
please. 

281. GOING IN DEBT. What 
comparison is there between the guilt 
of the poor uneducated wretch, who 
ventures, in rags and misery, to steal 
from the apparent superfluities of his 
neighbour a portion for his starving 
family, and the crime of the well-fed, 
well-dressed, much-accomplished lady, 
who sails into the shop of the unwary 
tradesman for articles of useless luxury; 
and, under cover of the respectability 
of her appearance and the address she 
gives, " defrauds him of property to a 
considerable amount!" The ragged 
culprit is watched and driven from the 
window the fashionable thief is Avel- 
comed in complacently and bowed out 
gratefully, with the promise that " her 
esteemed orders shall be attended to 
immediately." When the goods she 
has nominally purchased are sent home, 
and they, like their real owner, are 
readily taken in, the grand piano 18, 
perhaps, heard in her elegantly fur 
uished villa, or the carriage of som 
wealthier friend is standing at the door. 
The lady's place in church and in so 
ciety is gaily filled, and, for a certain, 
or rather uncertain period, the custom 
and the company of " such a highly- 
respectable family." are considered an 
acquisition in the neighbourhood. But 
" a change comes over the spirit of the 
dream:" in course of time, the lady 
who ordered with the greatest ease, is 
discovered to pay with the greatest 
difficulty, and her commands are not 
so much esteemed as formerly. The 
dishonest beggar, if detected, is com- 
mitted to prison ; but. when things 
come to a crash with the fashionable 
thief, the lady's husband is simply d^- 
clared " unfortunate ;" and if forced to 
remove into a humbler dwelling, in 



94 



EXAMPLES DO NOT AUTHORIZE SIXS. 



district in which she is not known, the 
lady is at liberty to pursue her former 
practices of shop-lifting 1 , as far as cir- 
cumstances will allow ! It is certainly 
not too much to assert that every one of 
the articles which have been thus fool- 
ishly and fraudulently obtained, and 
the possession of w T hich appeared so in- 
dispensable to the vanity or the con- 
sequence of those who longed for them, 
has, in its turn, helped to lessen their 
consideration, and to expose them to 
ridicule, if not contempt. What, in 
fact, has the costly time-piece, " the 
curtains like Mrs. Pimlico's," the "love 
of a looking-glass like that next door," 
which cost nearly a quarter's income 
what have these and similar inconsist- 
ent belongings brought upon their un- 
lucky owners ? Literally, nothing but 
censure and ill-will ; and yet, for these, 
conscience and comfort have been bar- 
tered, and the elegant lady will expose 
herself to tremble before the humblest 
tradesman in the street, lest he should 
deny her the commonest necessaries of 
life ! 

282. THE FEMALE TEMPER. 
No trait of character is more agreeable 
in a female than the possession of a 
sweet temper. Home can never be 
happy without it. It is like the flowers 
that spring up in our pathway, reviv- 
ing and cheering us. Let a man go 
home at night, wearied and worn by 
the toils of the day, and how soothing 
is a word dictated by a good disposi- 
tion ! It is sunshine falling on his heart. 
He is happy, and the cares of life a*e 
forgotten. A sweet temper has a sooth- 
ing influence over the minds of a whole 
family. Where it is found in the wife 
and mother, yon observe a kindness 
and love predominating over the natu- 
al feelings of a bad heart. Smiles, 
ind words and looks, characterize the 
hildren, and peace and love have their 
dwelling there. Study, then, to acquire 
and attain a sweet temper. 

2.S3. HOW TO REMOVE STAINS 
FROM FLOORS. For removing spots 
of grease from boards, take equal parts 



of a pound of each, and boil in a quart 
of soft water; and, while hot, lay it on 
the greased parts, allowing it to remain 
on them for ten or twelve hours ; after 
which it may be scoured oft' with sand 
and water. A floor much spotted with 
grease should be completely washed 
over with this mixture the day before 
it is ccoured. Fullers' earth or ox-gall 
boiled together, form a very powerful 
cleansing mixture for floors or carpets 
Stains of ink are removed by strong 
vinegar, or salts of lemon will remove 
them. 

284. WILLS. A will is an instru 
ment in writing, executed in fonn of 
law, by which a person makes a dispo 
sition of his property, to take effect 
after his death. 

A codicil is a supplement or addition 
to a will, and by which the will is alter 
ed, explained or added to, but in no 
case wholly revoked. 

A bequest to a subscribing of a will 
is void. 

Let every man about to make a will 
endeavour to make it as concise as pos- 
sible ; and if he employs a lawyer, 
agree to pay him, not by the length, 
but by the transaction. Let him keep 
in his mind that every trust or use he 
creates, also creates the danger of a 
Chancery suit. Every will should be 
dated on the day it is executed. It is 
also of the first importance that it 
should be prepared without blot or al- 
teration, or erasure, for it is an instru- 
ment that may not come into operation 
for many years of a surety not until 
the party best capable of explaining it, 
the testator himself, is removed from 
the scene of evidence, and possibly not 
until both the writer of it, and the 
witnesses, have either ceased to exist, 
or whose locality is not to be traced. 

285. FOR 'SPRAINS AND 
BRUISES. Take one pint of train- 
oil, half-a-pound of stone-pitch, half-a- 
pound of resin, half-a-pound of bees 
wax, and half-a-pound of stale tallow 
or in like proportion. Boil them to- 
gether for about half-an-hour skim off 



of fullers' earth and pearlash, a quarter | the scum, and pour the iquid int>

cups, and when cold it will be ready 
for use. When needed, it must be 
spread as thick, but not thicker, than 
blister-salve, upon a piece of coarse 
flaxen cloth, 
sprained or bruise 
for a day or more ; it will gif e almost 
immediate relief, and one or two 
plaisters will be sufficient for a perfect 
cure. 

'286. SAUCE FOR FISH. Twenty- 
four anchovies chopped ; ten eschalots ; 
two ounces of horse-radish, scraped ; 
four blades of mace ; one lemon, sliced ; 
twelve cloves; quarter-of-an-ounce of 
black pepper, whole ; one gill of the 
anchovy liquor ; one quart of best 
vinegar ; one quart of water. Let the 
whole simmer on the fire until reduced 
to one quart, in a covered saucepan, 
strain, and bottle for use. If required 
for long keeping-, add a quarter-of-an- 
ounce of cayenne pepper. 

287. CANARIES. Especial care 
must be taken to keep the canary 
scrupulously clean. For this purpose, 
the cage should be strewed every 
morning with clean sand, or rather, 
h'ne gravel, for small pebbles are abso- 
lutely essential to life and health in cage 
birds; fresh water must be given every 
day, both for drinking and bathing ; 
the latter being in a shallow vessel ; 
and, during the moulting season, a 
small bit of iron should be put into the 
water for drinking. The food of a 
canary should consist principally of 
summer rape-seed, that is, of those 
small brown rape-seeds which are ob- 
tained from plants sown in the spring, 
and which ripen during the summer ; 
large and black rape-seeds, on the con- 
trary, are produced by such plants as 
are sown in autumn, and reaped in 
spring. A little chickweed in spring, 
lettuce-leaves in summer, and endive 
in autumn, with slices of sweet apple in 
winter, may be safely given, but bread 
and sugar ought to be generally avoid- 
ed. Occasionally also, a few poppy or 
canary-seeds, and a small quantity 



simple food, and fresh but not cold air 
are essential to the well-being of a 
canary. During the winter, the cage 
should ~,ever be hung in a room with- 
out a fire, but even then, w r hen the air 
is mild, and the sun shines bright, the 
little prisoner will be refreshed by 
having the window open. The cage 
should never be less than eight inches 
in diameter, and a foot high, with 
perches at different heights. 

288. MOTHER EVE'S PUDDING. 

IF you would have a good pudding, ob- 
serve what you're taught : 
Take two pennyworth of eggs, when 

twelve for the groat ; 
And of the same fruit that Eve had 

once chosen, 
Well pared and well chopp'd, at least 

half-a-dozen ; 
Six ounces of bread, (let your maid eat 

the crust,) 
The crumbs must be grated as small 

as the dust ; 
Six ounces of currants from the stones 

you must sort, 
Lest they break out your teeth, and 

spoil all your sport ; 
Five ounces of sugar won't make it too 

sweet ; 
Some salt and some nutmeg will make 

it complete, 
Three hours let it boil, without hurry 

or flutter, 
And then serve it up without sugar or 

butter. 

289. WASH FOR SUNBURN. 
Take two drachms of borax, one drachm 
of Roman alum, one drachm of cam- 
phor, half-an-ounce of sugar-candy, and 
a pound of ox-gall. Mix, and stir well 
for ten minutes or so, and repeat thia 
stirring thrae or four times a-day for a 
fortnight, till it appears clear and 
transparent. Strain through blotting 
paper, and bottle up for use. 

290. STEWED MUSHROOMS. 
Cut off the ends of the stalks, and paro 
neatly some middle -oized or button* 



bruised hemp-seed may be added, but j mushrooms, and put them into a basin

they are done. When all are prepared, 
take them from the water \vith the 
hands to avoid the sediment, and put 
them into a stew-pan with a little fresh 
butter, white pepper, salt, and a little 
lemon-juice ; cover the pan close, and 
let them stew gently for twenty mi- 
nutes or half an hour ; then thicken 
the butter with a spoonful of flour, and 
add gradually sufficient cream, or 
cream and milk, to make the same 
about thv thickness of good cream. 
Season the sauce to palate, adding a 
little pounded mace or grated nutmeg. 
Let the whole stew gently until the 
mushrooms are tender. Remove every 
particle of butter which may be float- 
ing on the top before serving. 

291. QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 
ON FAMILIAR THINGS' Why 
do candles and lamps " spirt," when 
rain is at hand? Because the air is 
filled with vapour, and the humidity 
penetrates the wick, where (being 
formed into steam) it expands sudden- 
ly, and produces a little explosion. 

292. Why does a drop of water 
sometimes roll along a piece of hot iron 
without leaving the least trace ? 
Because (when the iron is very hot in- 
deed) the bottom of the drop is turned 
into vapour, which buoys the drop up, 
without allowing it to touch the iron. 

293. why does a laundress pvvt a 
little saliva on a flat-iron, to know if it 
be hot enough? Because, when the 
saliva sticks to the box, and is evapo- 
rated, she knows it is not sufficiently 
hot : but when it runs along the iron, 
it is. 

294. Why is the flat-iron hotter, if 
the saliva runs along it, than if it ad- 
heres till it is evaporated ? Because, 
when the saliva runs along the iron, 
the heat is sufficient to convert the 
bottom of the drop into vapour ; but if 
the pnliva will not roll, the iron is not 
sufficiently hot to convert the bottom 
of the drop into vapour. 

295. Why do wet feet or clothes 
give us " cold ?" Because, the evapo- 
ration absorbs the heat go abundantly 
from the surface of our body, that its 



temperature is lowered below its na 
tural standard ; in consequence of 
which health is injured. [This also 
explains why it is dangerous to sleep 
in a damp oed.] 

296. Why is the health injured when 
the temperature of the body is reduced 
below its natural standard ? Because, 
the balance of the circulation is de- 
stroyed, blood is driven away from the 
external surface by the chill, arid 
thrown upon the internal organs, which 
are oppressed by this increased load oi 
blood. 

297 Why do not sailors get cold, 
who are frequently wet all day with 
sea-water; Because the salt of the sea 
retards evaporation; and (&s the heat 
of their bodies is drawn off gradually) 
the sensation of cold is prevented. 
Also, the salt of the sea acts as a stimu- 
lous, and keeps the blood circulating in 
the skin. 

298. What is the cause of snow ? 
When the air is nearly saturated with 
vapour, and condensed by a current of 
air below freezing-point, some of the 
vapour is condensed, and frozen into 
snow. A few years ago, some fisher- 
men (who wintered at Nova Zeinbla) 
after they had been shut up in a hut for 
several days, opened the window ; and 
the cold external air rushing in, in- 
stantly condensed the air of the hut, 
and its vapour fell on the floor in a 
shower of snow. 

299. What is the cause of sleet ? 
When flakes of snow (in their descent) 
pass through a bed of air above freez- 
ing-point, they partially melt, and fall 
to the earth as half-melted snow. 

300. What is hail ? Rain which 
has passed in its descent through some 
cold bed of air, and has been frozen MI 
to drops of ice. 

301. What is rain ? The vapour of 
the clouds or air condensed, and precip- 
itated to the earth. 

302. Why are rain-drops sometimes 
much larger than at other times? 
When the rain-cloud is floating noar 
the earth, the drope> are large, because 
such a cloud is much more dense than 



AS A MAN LIVES, SO SHALL HE DIE; 



one more elevated. The size of the 
rain-drop is also increased according to 
the rapidity with which the vapours 
ire condensed. 

303. Why does the Bible say that 
Grod "giveth snow like wool?" Be- 
cause snow (being a very bad conductor 
of heat) protects vegetables and seeds 
from the frost and cold. 

304. How does the non-conducting 
power of snow protect vegetables from 
the frost and cold? It prevents the 
heat of the earth from being drawn off 
by the cold air which rests upon it. 

305. Why are woollens and furs used 
for clothing in cold weather ? Because 
they are very bad conductors of heat, 
and therefore prevent the warmth of 
the body from being drawn off by the 
cold air. 

306. Do not woollens and furs actu 
ally impart heat to the body? No; 
they mert-Jy prevent the heat of the 
body from escaping. 

307. Where would the heat escape 
to, if the body were not wYapped in 
wool or fur ? The heat of the body 
would fly off into the air ; for the cold 
air, coming in contact with our body, 
would gradually draw away its heat, till 
it was as cold as the air itself. 

308. What then is the principal use 
of clothing in winter-time ? To pre- 
vent the animal heat from escaping too 
freely; and to protect the body from 
the external air i^or wind), which would 
carry away its heat too rapidly. 

309. Why are March winds dry ? 
Because they generally blow from the 
east or north-east, and therefore sweep 
over the continent of America. 

310._What is the use of March 
winds ? They dry the soil (which is 
saturated by the floods of February), 
break up the heavy clods, and fit the 
iand for the seeds which are committed 
to it. 

311. Why is it said that "March 
comes in like a lion ?" Because it 
comes in with blustering east winds, so 
essential to dry the soil, which wojid 
otherwise rot the seed committed 
to it. 



3J2. Why does " M.-irch go out like 
n lamb?" Because the water, evapor 
ated by the high winds, falls again in 
showers to fertilize the earth, and 
breaks the violence of the winds. 

313. Why is it said that " A bushel 
of March dust is worth a king's ran- 
som ?" Because it indicates that there 
has been a continuance of dry weather^ 
and unless March be dry, the seed wiL 
rot in wet soil. 

314. W T hy is it said that "A dry cold 
March never begs bread ?" Because 
the dry cold winds of March prepare 
the soil for seeds, which germinate and 
produce fruit in the autumn. 

315. Why is it said that "A wet 
March makes a sad autumn?" Be- 
cause, if March be wet, so much of <he 
seed rots in the ground, that the au- 
tumn crops are spoiled. 

316. Why is it said that "March 
flowers make no summer bowers?" 
Because, if the spring be veiy mild, 
vegetation gets too forward, and is 
pinched by the nightly frosts, so as to 
produce neither fruits nor flowers. 

317. Why is it said that "April 
showers bring May flowers '.'" Because 
April showers supply the principal 
nourishment on which the seeds de- 
pend for their development. 

318. Why is there more rain from 
September to M?.rch, than from March 
to September ? From September to 
March the temperature of the air is 
constantly decreasing; on which ac- 
count, its capacity for holding vapour 
is on the decrease, and the vapour is 
precipitated as rain. 

319. OYSTER POWDER Open 

the oysters carefully, so ai not to cut 
them except in dividing the gristle 
which attaches the shells. Put them

them into a paste; roll this paste out | upon the prominent traits of that charac 
several times, and lastly flour it, and ' 
roll ifc out the thickness of a half-crown, 
and cut it into pieces about one inch 
square ; lay them in a Dutch oven, 
where they will dry so gently as not to 
get burned ; turn them every half hour, 
and when they begin to dry crumble 
them. They will take about four hours 
to dry. Pound them, sift them, and 
put them into dry bottles; cork and 
seal them. Three dozen of natives re- 
quire seven ounces and a -half of flour 
to make them into a paste weighing 
eleven ounces, and when dried, six and 
a-half ounces. To make half-a-pint of 



sauce, put one ounce of butter into a flatter, and if the brain be rather small, 



stewpan with three drachms of oyster 
powder, and six tablespoonfuls of milk ; 
set it on a slow fire, stir it till it boils, 
and season it with salt. As a sauce, it 
is excellent for fish, fowls, or rump- 
steaks. Sprinkled on bread and but- 
ter, it makes a good sandwich. 

320. HOW TO WIN A SWEET- 
HEART. The attention and the ad- 
miration of an individual of the opposite 
sex may be obtained in various ways ; 
and love may be and is often engender- 
ed where none is felt by the opposite 
party. But all this is accomplished by- 
playing upon some passion or passions 
of the individual whose love is desired 
and whose hand is to be won. Thus 
some are obtained by playing upon the 
desire for wealth or high stati n in so- 
ciety; others through their pride, by 
flattery of their persons ; others through 
their kindness, by exciting their benevo- 
lent feelings ; others through their nat- 
ural amative passions, by exciting the 
desire of stfxual love ; others by show- 
ing one's self to possess, or by pretend- 
ing to possess, kindred sympathies and 
feelings kindred emotions of head and 
heart kindred likes and desires kin- 
dred tastes and sentiments. To win 
the affections, therefore, we should 
learn the character of the individual 
whose love is sought. That being 
known, success is to be obtained by 
bringing the batteries to bear properly 



ter. 

True love arises from a principle of 
sympathy from a oneness of feeling 
from a similarity in some points of 
character, although other points m;iy 
be very dissimilar, from showing that 
you possess something which the other 
admires. Acting upon th4s you may 
induce in another love for you, find

Upon this subject, I give you the 
phrenological teachings of O. S. Fow 
ler, who says : 

" If approbativeness predominate, 
and causality be moderate, you may 



put it on thickly. Praise their dress, 
features, appearance, on particular oc- 
casions, and any and everything they 
take pride in. '

Take much notice of 
continually saying 



something to tickle their vanity; for 
this organization will bear all the " soft 
soap " you can administer. When you 
have gained this organ, you have got 
the " bell-sheep," which all the other 
faculties will blindly follow on the run. 
But if approbativeness be only full or 
large, with reason and morality quite 
as large or larger, and the head of a 
good size, and well developed, " soft- 
soap " will not take, but will only 
sicken ; for reason will soon penetrate 
your motive, and morality will reverse 
the other faculties against you, and de- 
stroy all chance of gaining the affec- 
tions. See to it that you really esteem 
those with this organization esteem 
them not for their dress, beauty, man- 
ners, &c., but for their moral purity, 
their elevated sentiments, their fine 
feelings, and their intellectual attain- 
ments. As they estimate themselves 
and others not by a standard of wealth, 
beauty, dress, &c., but by a moral and 
intellectual standard, so your showing 
them that you really esteem those qual- 
ities which they prize so highly, will 
cause them to perceive that your tastes 
harmonize with theirs, and thus turn 
their leading organs in your favour, and 
unite and endear them to you. 



TOR AGE AND WANT SAVE WHILE TOD MAY. 



" If benevolence predominate in the 
person, show yourself kind, not to the 
individual alone, nor in little matters of 
modern politeness, but as an habitual 
feeling of your soul, always gushing 
forth spontaneously at the call of want 
or suffering, and ready to make per- 
sonal sacrifices to do good. Be philan- 



thropic, and show yourself deeply in 
terested in the welfare of your fellow- 
men. This will gratify his or her be- 
nevolence, and bring it over in your 
behalf, which will draw the other fac- 
ilties along with it.

organs, do not talk fashionable non-

" If the person be pious and devout, 
be religious yourself, and your religious 
feelings will strike a chord that will 
throb through her whole soul, kindling 
an irresistible flame of mutual love. 

"If the individual be a timid damsel, 
do not frighten her ; for this will drive 
away every vestige of lurking affection, 
and turn her faculties against you; 
but be gentle and soothing and offer 
her all the protection in your power, 
causing her to feel safe under your 
wing, and she will hover under it, and 
love you devoutly for the care you be- 
stow upon her. 

" If ideality be large show refine- 
ment and good taste, and avoid all 
grossness and improper allusions; for 
nothing will more effectually array 'her 
against you than either impropriety or

mainly, that you wish to enlist, show 
yourself affectionate and tender. As

principle, the disengaged affections ol 
almost any one can be secured, especi- 
ally if the organs of both be similar ; 
for the command thus obtained over 
the feelings, will, and even judgment, 
is almost unlimited. (Sec 2865.)

323. HOW TO WASH KID 
GLOVES. Have ready a little new 
milk in one saucer, and a piece of 
brown soap in another, and a clean 
cloth or. towel folded three or four 
times. On the cloth spread out the 
glove smooth and neat. Take a piece 
of flannel, drp it in the milk, then rub 
off a good quantity of soap to the wet- 
ted flannel, and commence to rub the 
glove downwards towards the fingers, 
holding it firmly with the left hand. 
Continue this process until the glove, 
if white, looks of a dingy yellow, 
though clean ; if coloured, till it looks 
dark and spoiled. Lay it to dry ; and 
old gloves will goon look nearly new. 
They will be soft, glossy, smooth, 
shapy and elastic. 

324. DYEING THE HAIR. It 
may be stated once for all that this 
practice is decidedly injurious. It 
may fail altogether in producing the 
desired result ; it is never unattended 
by a certain amount of unpleasant cir- 
cumstances, and frequently with evil 
results. 

In the first place, the alteration of 
the abnormal colour, so far as the ge- 
neral aspect of the face is concerned, 
hae an effect the very reverse of that 
which was intended. Every consti- 
tuent part of man tends to make the 
human machine one harmonious whole . 
the figure, the stature, the skin, the 
hair, the gait, &c. 

Fair hair is associated with a sangui- 
neous and lymphatic temperament, a 
fine and white skin, blue eyes, and a 
soft and mild expression. Black hair, 
on the contrary, is generally connected 
with a bilious habit of body, a muscu- 
lar and nervous temperament, a dark 
and yellowish skin, lively black eyes 
and a bold, proud air. Red hair is j 
associated with a peculiar constitution 



although closely approaching to tha 
fair type. In this variety the skin 
is transparent, fresh, and presents n 
peculiar limpidity, which belongs ex- 
clusively to the colour of hair men- 
tioned. 

To what absurd contrasts, then, are 
those persons not exposed, who, from 
idle vanity, attempt to break the bond 
of union which exists between the 
hair and the rest of the body? If, 
then, from the impression that red hair 
is a disfigurement, it is dyed black 
what relation can exist between this 
new colour, and the soft blue eye, and 
a skin so fine and so susceptible, that 
the sun's rays seem to penetrate it, 
in the form of those lentiginous spots 
commonly called freckles. 

These objections do not apply with 
equal force to those cases where the 
object is merely to disguise partial dis- 
colouration of the hair ; but, at the 
same time, it is not always easy to pro- 
duce the exact shade of the original 
colour, and when the hair begins tc 
grow this partial discolouration reap- 
pears and discloses the dye. 

Finally, when this discolouration is 
widely d'iffused over the head, and re- 
quires an extensive application of the 
dye, in the case of an old man for ex 
ample, the hair will then present a 
lustre, brilliancy and tint, in melan- 
choly contradistinction with the faded 
and wrinkled skin, dull leaden eye, 
furrowed cheek, and broken and tot- 
tering gait. 

Besides, experience has sufficiently 
established the fact, that the ingre- 
dients of which the dyes are composed, 
are far from being free from danger or 
inconvenience. The texture of the 
hair itself is deteriorated by them. 

Composed as they are generally, of 
very active remedies, they burn the 
hair, alter the piliferous capsule , arrest 
the natural secretion of the hair and 
favour the production of baldness, 
They also frequently produce inflam- 
mation of the scalp. I have met with 
many cases in which females who had 
been in the habit of using those dyes 



WE IXCREASE OUR WEALTH WHEN WE LESSEN OUR DESIRES. 



101 



Were reduced to the sad alternative of 
maintaining a disagreeable arid painful 
eruption, the result of the ingre- 
dients employed, or to abandon the 
disguise they were intended to pro- 
duce. 

Since we cannot hope to prohibit 
altogether the use of compositions for 
dyeing the hair, it only remains to 
point out those that are the least in 
jurious, and most likely to answer the 
purpose sought for. 

From the earliest time the following 
substances have been employed to 
blacken the hair: The oil of cade, 
gall nuts, the lye of vine branches, 
preparations of lead ; ravens' eggs 
have been extolled, probably because 
the colour of that bird is the most 
perfect black ; putrified swallows, 
colocynth, &c. However, experience 
has shown that a certain number of 
preparations possess more or less effi- 
cacy, the principal of which I shall 
here point out. 

Preparations of silver are used in 
Carious forms ; as, for example, a po- 
uado composed of nitrate of silver, 
eream of tartar, ammoniac, and pre- 
pared lard. 

This pomade is to be applied to the 
hair by the aid of the brush and comb. 
They are also used in the form of 
paste : Nitrate of silver, proto-nitrate 
of mercury, and distilled water. Dis- 
solve strain, and wash the residue 
with sufficient water to make a paste. 

A clear paste is made of this solu- 
tion and a sufficient quantity of starch, 
which is then carefully applied to the 
hair in the evening. The head is 
covered with a cap of gummed taffeta 
during the night, and the following 
morning the paste is washed off, and 
the hair anointed with any simple oint- 
ment. (Sec 270, 271.) 

325. COOKING COLD BUTCHERS 

MEAT. 

326. BEEF MINCED. Cut into small 
dice remains of cold beef; and gravy 
reserved from it on the first day of its 
being served should be put in the stew- 



pan with the addition of warm water 
some mace, sliced eschalot, salt, and 
black pepper. Let the whole simmer 
gently for an hour. A few minutes be- 
fore it is served, take out the ~_eat and 
dish it ; add to the gravy some walnut 
catsup, and a little lemon juice, or wal- 
nut pickle. Boil up the gravy once 
more, and, when hot, pour it over the 
meat. Serve it up with bread sip- 
pets. 

327. BEEF (WITH MASHED POTA- 
TOES). Mash some potatoes with hot 
milk, the yolk of an egg, some butter 
and salt. Slice the cold beef and lay 
it at the bottom of a pie-dish, adding to 
it some sliced eschalot, pepper, salt, and 
a little beef gravy ; cover the whole 
with a thick paste of potatoes, making 
the crust to rise in the centre above 
the edges of the dish. Score the po- 
tato crust with the point of a knife in 
squares of equal sizes. Put the dish 
before a fire in a Dutch oven, and 
brown it on all side? ; by the time it is 
coloured, the meat and potatoes will be 
sufficiently done. 

328. BEEF BUBBLF AND SQUEAK. 
Cut into pieces, convenient for fry- 
ing, cold roast or boiled beef; pepper, 
salt, and fry them ; when done lay 
them on a hot drainer, and while the 
meat is draining- from the fat used in 
frying them, have in readiness a cab- 
bage already boiled in two waters ; chop 
it small, and put it in the frying-pan 
with some butter, add a little pepper 
and keep stirring it, that all of it 
may be equally done. When taken 
from the fire, sprinkle over the cab- 
bage a very little vinegar, only enough 
to give it a slight acid taste. Place 
the cabbage in the centre of the dish, 
and arrange the slices of meat r eatly 
around it. 

329. BEEF OR MUTTON LOBSCOUS. 
Mince, not too finely, some cold roast 
beef or mutton. Chop the bones, and 
put them in a saucepan with six pota- 
toes peeled and sliced, one onion, alsc 
sliced, some pepper and salt; of these 
make a gravy. When the potatoes arf 
completely incorporated vith the grary 



:o2 



WHERE REASON RULES, APPETITE OBEYS J 



take out the bortos, and put in the 
meat; stew the whole together lor an 
hour before it is to be served. 

330. BEEF EISSOLES. Mir.ce and 
season cold beef, and llavour it \vith 
mushroom or walnut catsup. Make 
of beef dripping a very thin paste, roll 
it out in thin pieces, about four inches 
square ; enclose in each piece some of 
the mince, in the same way as lor 
putts, cutting each neatly all round: 
fry them in dripping of a very light 
brov.-n. The paste can scarcely be roll- 
ed out too thin. 

331. VEAL MINCED. Cut veal from 
the fillet or shoulder into very small 
dice ^ put into veal or mutton broth 
with a little mace, white pepper, salt, 
some lemon-peel grated, and a table- 
spoonful of mushroom catsup or mush- 
room powder, rubbed smooth into the 
gravy. Take out some of the gravy 
when nearly done, and when cool 
enough thicken it with flour, cream, 
and a little butter ; boil it up with the 
rest of the gravy, and pour it over the 
meat when done. Garnish with bread 
sippets. A little lemon-juice added to 
the gravy improves its flavour. 

332. VlEAL DRESSED WITH WHITE 

SAUCE. Boil milk or cream with a 
thickening of flour and butter ; put into 
it thin slices of cold veal, and simmer 
it in the gravy till it is made hot with- 
out boiling. When nearly done, beat 
up the yolk of an egg, with a little an- 
chovy and white sauce ; pour it gently 
to the rest, stirring it all the time ; 
simmer, again the whole together, and 
serve it with sippets of bread and curl- 
ed bacon alternately. 

333. VEAL RISSOLES. Mince an^ 
pound veal extremely fine ; grate into 
it some remains of cooked ham. Mix 
these well together with white sauce, 
flavoured with mushrooms : form this 
mixture into balls, and enclose each in 
pastry. Fry them in butter of a nice 
brown. The same mince may be fried 
in balls without pastry, being first ce- 
mented together with egg and bread 
crumbs. 

334. MUTTON HASHED. Cut cold 



mutton into thin slices, fat and lean to- 
gether ; make gravy with the bone* 
whence the nuaT lias been taken, boil 
them long enoruh in water, with onion, 
pepper, and salt; strain the gravj and 
warm, but not boil, the mutton 'in it. 
Then take out some of the gravy to 
thicken it with flour and butter, and 
Hit v< air it with mushroom catsup. Tour 
in the thickening and boil it up, having 
before taken out the meat, and placed 
it neatly on the dish in which it is to go 
to the table. Pour over it the boiling 
gravy, and add sippets of bread. 

335. LAMB. Fry slices or chops of 
lamb in butter till they are slightly 
browned. Serve them on a puree of 
cucumbers, or on a dish of spinach ; or 
dip the slices in bread crumbs, chopped 
parsley, and yolk of an egg ; some 
grated lemon and a little nutmeg may 
be. added. Fry them, and pour a little 
nice gravy over them when served. 

336. PORK. Slices of cold pork, 
fried and laid on apple sauce, form an 
excellent side or corner dish. Boiled 
pork may also be made into rissole*, 
minced very fine like sausage meat, 
and seasoned sufficiently, but not over 
much. 

337. TO CLEAN WHITE SATIN 
AND FLO WERED SILKS. 1. Mix 
sifted stale bread crumbs with powder 
blue, and rub it thoroughly all over, 
then shake it well, and dust it with 
clean soft cloths. Afterwards, where 
there are any gold or silver flow r ers, 
take a piece of crimson ingrain velvet, 
rub the flowers with it, which will re- 
store them to their original lustre. 2. 
Pass them through a solution of fine 
hard soap, at a hand heat, drawing 
them through the hand. Rinse in luke- 
warm water, diy and finish by pinning 
out. Brush the flossy or bright side with 
a clean clothes-brush, the way of the 
nap. Finish them by dipping a spongo 
into size, made by boiling isinglaaa 
in water, and rub the wrong side. Rinse 
out a second time, and brush, and dry 
near a fire or in a warm room. Silk 
may be treated in the same way, bu< 
not brushed. (See 42.) 



WHEN APPETITE COMMANDS, THE POCKET PAYS. 



103 



338. POTTED BEEP. -Take 
three or four pounds, or any smaller 
quantity of lean Ixvjf, free from sinews, 
and rub them well with a mixture 
iiuide of a handful of salt, one ounce of 
saltpetre, and one ounce of coarse sugar ; 
let the meat lie in the salt for two days, 
turning and rubbing it twice a day. 
Put it into a stone jar with a little beef 
gra^y, and cover it with a paste to keep 
it close. Bake it for several hours in a 
very slow oven, till the meat is tender ; 
then pour off the gravy, which should 
be in a very small quantity, or the 
juice of the meat will be lost; pound 
the meat when cold, in a marble mor- 
tar till it is reduced to a smooth paste, 
adding by degrees a little fresh butter 
melted. Season it as you proceed with 
pepper, allspice, nutmeg, pounded mace, 
and cloves, or such of these spices as 
are thought agreeable. Some flavour 
with anchovy, ham, shallots, mustard, 
wine, flavoured vinegar, ragout powder, 
curry powder, &c., according to taste. 
When it is thoroughly beaten and 
mingled together, press it closely into 
small shallow pots, nearly full, and fill 
them up with a layer a quarter of -an 
inch thick of clarified butter, and tie 
them up with a bladder, or sheet of 
India rubber. They should be kept in 
a cool place. 

339. CAKE OF MIXED FRUITS. 
Extract the juice from red currants 
by simmering them very gently for a 
few minutes over a slow fire ; strain it 
through a folded muslin, and to one 
pound of it add a pound and a-half of 
nonsuches or of freshly gathered apples, 
pared, and rather deeply cored, that 
the fibrous part may be avoided. Boil 
these quite slowly until the mixture 
is perfectly smooth ; then to evaporate 
part of the moisture, let the boiling be 
quickened. In from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes, draw the pan from the 
fire, and throw in gradually a pound 
and a quarter of sugar in fine powder ; 
mix it well with the fruit, and when it 
is dissolved, continue the boiling rapidly 
for twenty minutes longer, keeping the 
mixture constantly st : rz ^d ; put it irt " 



a mould and store it when cold, for 
winter use, or serve it for dessert, or 
for the second course ; in the latter 
case, decorate it with spikes of almonds 
blanched, and heap solid whipped 
cream round it. or pour a custard into 
the dish. For dessert, it may be gar- 
nished with dice of the palest apple- 
jelly. Juice of red currants, one pound; 
apples (pared and cored), one pound 
and a-half twenty-five to thirty min- 
utes. Sugar one pound and a-half 
twenty minutes. 

340. THE FAMILY CIRCLE. 
Under this title, a series of friendly 
parties have been instituted by a group 
of acquaintances in New York. The 
following form of invitation and the 
rules of the Family Circle will be 
found interesting, probably useful : 

Will you do me the favour of meet- 
ing here, as a guest, on next, at 

seven precisely, a few friends who have 
kindly joined in an attempt to com- 
mence occasional, pleasant, and social 
parties, of which the spirit and intent 
will be better understood by the perus- 
al of the few annexed remarks and 
rules from 

Yours sincerely, 

1st. Worldly appearance ; the phan- 
tom leading many to suppose that 
wealth is the standard of worth in the 
minds of friends, a notion equally de- 
grading to both parties. 

2nd. Overdress ; causing unneces- 
sary expense and waste of time. 

3rd. Expensive entertainments ; as 
regards refreshments. 

4th. Late hours. 

The following brief rules are sug- 
gested, in the hope to show the way to 
a more constant, easy, and friendly in- 
tercourse amongst friends, the writer 
feeling convinced that society is equal- 
ly beneficial and requisite in fact, that 
mankind in seclusion, like the sword 
in the scabbard, often loses polish, and 
gradually rusts. 

RULE 1. That meetings be held in 
rotation, at each member's house, foi 
the enjoyment of conversation ; music 



104 



DEEP RIVERS FLO\S WITH SILENT MAJESTY J 



grave and gay ; dancing, gay only ; a*U [ lovers, privileged to do odd things 

' during their temporary lunacy, and also 
married couples, who are expected to 
dance together at least once during the 
evening, and oftener if they please. 

RULE 9. That to avoid unnecessary 
expense, the refreshments be limited 
to cold meat, sandwiches, bread, 
cheese, butter, vegetables, fruits, tea, 
coffee, negus, punch, malt liquors, &c. 

RULE 10. That all personal or face- 
to-face laudatory speeches (commonly 
called toasts, or, as may be, roasts,) be 
for the future forbidden, without per- 
mission or enquiry, for reasons follow- 
ing : That as the family circle in- 
cludes bachelors and spinsters, and he, 
she, or they may be secretly engaged, 



card-playing at limited stakes 

RULE 2. That such meetings com- 
mence at seven and end about or after 
twelve, and that members and guests 
be requested to remember that punctu- 
ality has been called the politeness of 
kings. 

RULE 3. That as gentlemen are al- 
lowed for the whole season to appear, 
like the raven, in one suit, ladies are 
to have the like privilege ; and that no 
lady be allowed to quiz or notice the 
habits of another lady ; and that demi- 
toilette in dress be considered the bet- 
ter taste in the family circle ; not that 
the writer wishes to raise or lower the 
proper standard of ladies' dress, which 
ought to be neither too high nor too 
low, but at a happy medium. 

RULE 4. That any lady infringing 
the last rule, be liable to reproof by 
the oldest lady present at the meeting, 
if the oldest lady, like the oldest in- 
habitant, can be discovered. 

RULE 5. That all members or guests 
be requested to bring with them their 
own vocal, instrumental or dance music, 
and take it away with them if possible, 
to avoid loss and confusion. 

RULE 6. That no member or guest 
able to sing, play, or dance, refuse, un- 
less excused by medical certificate ; 
and that no cold w sore throat be al- 
lowed to last more than a week. 

RULE 7. That as every member or 
guest known to be able to sing, play, 
or dance, is bound to do so if request- 
ed, the performer (especially if timid,) 
is to be kindly criticised and encou- 
raged ; it being a fact well known that 
the greatest masters of an art are al- 
ways the most lenient critics, from 
their deep knowledge of the feeling, 
intelligence, and perseverance required 
to at all approach perfection. 

RULE 8. That gentlemen present do 
.ay every attention to ladies, especially 
; h.>rs; but such attention is to be 
general, and not particular for in- 
stance, no gentleman is to dance more 
that, three times with one lady during 
the evening, except in tie case of 



it 



be therefore cruel to excite 



hopes that may be disappointed , and 
that as some well-informed Benedict 
of long experience may after supper 
advise the bachelor to find the way to 
woman's heart vice versa, some deep- 
feeling wife or widow, by " pity mov- 
en," may perhaps after supper advise 
the spinster the other way, which in 
public is an impropriety manifestly to 
be avoided. 

RULE 11, (suggested by a lady.) 
That any lady, after supper, may (if 
she please) ask any gentleman appar- 
ently diffident, or requiring encourage- 
ment, to dance with her, and that no 
gentleman can of course refuse so kind 
a request. 

RULE 12. That no gentleman be ex- 
pected to escort any lady home on foot 
beyond a distance of three miles, un- 
less the gentleman be positive and the 
lady agreeable. 

RULE THE LAST. That as the fore- 
going remarks and rules are intended, 
in perfect good faith and spirit, to be 
considered general and not personal, 
no umbrage is to be taken, and the 
reader is to bear in mind the common 
and homely saying 

" Always at trifles scorn to take offence, 
It shows great pride and very little sense.' 

P.S. To save trouble to both par- 
ties, this invitation be deemed accepted. 



SHALLOW BllOOKS ARE NOISY. 



105 



without the necessity to reply, unless 
refu&td within twenty-four hours. 

341. RICE BREAD. Take one 
pound and a halt' of rice, and boil it 
gently over a slow fire in three quarts 
of water about five hours, stirring it, 
and afterwards beating it up into a 
smooth paste. Mix this while warm 
into two gallons, or four pounds of 
flour, adding at the same time the usual 
quantity of yeast. Allow the dough to 
work a certain time near the fire, after 
which divide it into loaves, and it will 
be found, when baked, to produce 
twenty-eight or thirty pounds of excel- 
lent white bre^d. 

342. LYING WITH THE HEAD 
HIGH. It is often a question amongst 
people who are unacquainted with the 
anatomy and physiology of man,whether 
lying with his head exalted or even 
with the body is most wholesome. 
Most, consulting their own ease on this 
point, argue in favour of that which 
they prefer. Now, although mauv de- 
light in bolstering up their heads at 
night and sleep soundly without injury, 
yet we declare it to be a dangerous 
habit. The vessels through which 
blood passes from the heart to the 
head, are always lessened in the cavi- 
ties when the head is resting in bed 
higher than the body, therefore, in all 
diseases attended with fever, the head 
should be pretty near on a level with 
the body ; and people ought to ac- 
custom themselves to sleep thus to 
avoid danger. 

343. AMERICAN . HISTORY IN 
BRIEF.

344. TO WASH A WHITE 
LACE VEIL. Put the veil into a 
strong lather of white soap and very 
clear water, and let it simmer slowly 
for a quarter of an hour. Take it out 
and squeeze it well, but be sure not to 
rub it. Rinse it in two cold waters, 
with a drop or two of liquid blue in the 
last. Have ready some very clear gum 
arabic water, or some thin starch, or 
rice-water. Pass the veil through it, 
and clear it by clapping. Then stretch 
it out even, and pin it to dry on a linen 
clotb, making the edge as straight a*

TRUST NOT THE MAN WHO PROMISES WITH AN OATH. 



possible, opening out all the scallops, 
and fastening each with pins. When 
dry, lay a piece of thin muslin smooth- 
ly over it, and iron it on the wrong 
Bide. 

345. HONEY SOAP. Cut thin two 
pounds of yellow soap into a double 
saucepan, occasionally stirring it till it 
is itelted, which will be in a few min- 
utes if the w T ater is kept boiling around 
it , then add a quarter of a pound of 
palm oil, quarter of a pound of honey, 
three pennyworth of true oil of cinna- 
mon ; let all boil together another six 
or eight minutes ; pour out and stand it 
by till next day, it is then fit for imme- 
diate use. If made as these directions 
it will be found to be a very superior 
soap. 

346. TO DISTINGUISH MUSH- 
EOOMS FROM POISONOUS 
FUNGI. 1. Sprinkle a little salt on 
the spongy part or gills of the sample 
to be tried. If they turn yellow they 
are poisonous, if black, they are whole- 
some. Allow the salt to act before you 
decide on the question. 2. False 
mushrooms have a warty cap, or else 
fragments of membrane, adhering- to 
the upper surface, are heavy, and 
emerge from a vulva or bag ; they grow 
in tufts or clusters in woods, on the 
stumps of trees, &c., whereas the true 
mushrooms grow in pastures. 3. False 
mushrooms have an astringent, styptic, 
and disagreeable taste. 4. When cut 
they turn blue. 5. They are moist on 
the surface, and generally 6. Of a rose 
or orange, color. 7. The gills of the 
true mushroom are of a pinky red, 
changing to a liver colour. 8. The 
flesh is white. 9. The stem is white, 
solid, and cylindrical. 

347. LAVENDER SCENT BAG. 
Take of lavender flowers free from 
stalk, half a pound ; dried thyme and 
mint of each half an ounce ; ground 
cloves and caraways of each a quarter 
3f an rnnce ; common salt, dried, one 
ounce ; inix the whole well together, 
and put the product into silk or camb- 
ric bags. In this way it will perfume 
th drawers ad linen very nicely. 



348. WARMING COLD SWEET 

DJSHES. 

349. RICE PUDDING. Over the 

cold rice pudding pour a custard, and 
add a few lumps of jelly or preserved 
fruit. Remember to remove the baked 
coating of the pudding before the cus- 
tard is poured over it. 

350. APPLE TART. Cut into trian- 
gular pieces the remains of a cold apple 
tart; arrange the pieces around the 
sides of a glass or china bowl, and leave 
space in the centre for a custard to be 
poured in. 

351. PLUM PUDDING. Cut inU 
thin round slices cold plum pudding 
and fry them in butter. Fry also 
Spanish fritters, and place them high 
in the centre of the dish, and the fried 
pudding all round the heaped-up frit- 
ters. Powder all with lump sugar 
and serve them with wine sauce in a 
tureen. 

352. APPLES IN SYRUP FOR 
IMMEDIATE USE. Bare and core 
some hard round apples, and throw 
them into a basin of water ; as they are 
done, clarify as much loaf sugar as will 
cover them ; put the apples in along 
with the juice and rind of a lemon, and 
let them simmer till they are quite 
clear ; great care must be taken not to 
break them. Place them on the dish 
they are to appear upon at table, and 
pour the syrup over. 

353 TO PRESERVE CUCUM- 
BERS. Take large and fresh-gather- 
ed cucumbers ; split them down and 
take out all the seeds ; lay them in salt 
and w T ater that will bear an egg three 
days: set them on a fire with cold 
w r ater, and a smalt lump of alum, and 
boil them a few minutes, or till tender 
drain them, and pour on them a thin 
syrup : let them lie two days, boil the 
syrup again, and put it over the cucum- 
bers, repeat it twice more, then have 
ready some fresh-clarified sugar, boiled 
to a How (which may be known by 
dipping the skimmer into the sugar, and 
blowing strongly through the holes of 
it ; if little bladders appear, it has at 
attained that degree) ; put in the cv 



THE NOBLE MIND HAS NO RESENTMENTS. 



IV t 



cum bers. and fc.miner it five minutes : 
set it by till next day ; boil the syrup 
and cucumbers again, and set them in 
glasses lor use. 

354. BAKED PEARS. Take 
twelve large baking pears pare and 
cut them into halves, leaving on the 
stem about half an inch long : take out 
the core with the point of a knife, and 
place the HI close together in a block- 
tin saucepan, the inside of 'which is 
quite bright, with the cover to fit quite 
close, put to them the rind of a lemon 
cut thin, with half its juice, a small 
stick of cinnamon, and twenty grains 
of allspice ; cover them w 7 ith spring- 
water, and allow one pound of loaf- 
sugar to a pint and a-half of water : 
cover them up close, and bake them for 
six hours in a very slow oven : they 
will be quite tender, and of a bright 
colour. Prepared cochineal is gener- 
ally used for colouring the pears ; but 
if the above is strictly attended to, it 
will be found to answer best. 

355. SORE THROAT. -I have 
been subject to sore throat, and have 
invariably found the following prepara- 
tion (simple and cheap) highly efficaci- 
ous when used in the early stage : Pour 
a pint of boiling water upon twenty- 
five or thirty leaves of common sage ; 
let the infusion stand for half an hour. 
Add vinegar sufficient to make it mod- 
erately acid, and honey according to 
the taste. This combination of the as- 
tringent and the emolieut principle sel- 
dom fails to produce the desired effect. 
The infusion must be used as a gargle 
several times a-day. It has this advan- 
tage over many gargles it is pleasant 
to the taste, and may be swallowed oc- 
casionally, not only without danger, but 
with advantage. 

356. BELV1DERE CAKES, FOR 
BREAKFAST OR TEA. Take a 
quart of Hour, four eggs, a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg, a piece of lard 
the same size ; mix the butter and lard 
well in the flour; beat the eggs light in 
a pint bowl, and fill it up with cold 
milk ; then pour it gradually into the 
ftour; add a teaspoonful of salt; work 

5* 



it for eight or ten minutes only ; cut the 
dough with a knife the size you wish 
it; roll them into cakes about the size 
of a breakfast plate, and bake in a quick 
oven. 

357. CHARCOAL. All sorts of 
glass vessels and other utensils may bo 
purified from long-retained smells of 
every kind, in the easiest and most per- 
fect manner, by rinsing them out well 
with charcoal powder, after the grosser 
impurities have been scoured off with 
sand and potash. Rubbing the teeth, 
and washing out the mouth with fine 

harcoal powder, will render the teeth 
beautifully white, and the breath per- 
fectly sweet, where an offensive breath 
lias been owing to a scorbutic disposi- 
tion of the gums. Putrid water is im- 
mediately deprived of its bad smell by 
charcoal. When meat, fish, &c., from 
intense heat, or long keeping, are likely 
to pass into a state of corruption, a sim- 
ple and pure mode of keeping them 
sound and healthful is, by putting a few 
pieces of charcoal, each the size of an 
egg, into the pot or saucepan wherein 
the fish or flesh is to be boiled. Among 
others, an experiment of this kind was 
tried upon a turbot, which appeared to 
be too far gone to be eatable ; the cook, 
as advised, put three or four pieces of 
charcoal, each the size of an egg, under 
the strainer, in the fish-kettle : after 
boiling the proper time, the turbot 
came to the table sweet and firm. 

358. STAINING. GENERAL OB- 
SERVATIONS. When alabaster, mar- 
ble, and other stones, %re coloured, and 
the stain is required to be deep, it 
should be poured on boiling-hot, and 
brushed equally over every part if 
made with water; if with spirit, it 
should be applied cold, otherwise the 
evaporation, being too rapid, would 
leave the colouring matter on the sur- 
face, without any, or very little, being 
able to penetrate. In greyish or 
brownish stones, the stain will be 
wanting in brightness, because the nat- 
ural colour combines with the stain; 
therefore, if the stone be of a pure col- 
our, the >-esult will be a combination

WHEN ALOXE WE HAVE OUR THOUGHTS TO WATCH, 



of the colour and stair In staining 
bone or ivory, the colours will take bet- 
ter before than after polishing ; and 
if any dark spots appear, they should 
be rubbed with chalk, and the article 
dyed again to produce uniformity of 
shade. On removal from the boiling- 
hot dye-bath, the bone should be im- 
mediately plunged into cold water, to 
prevent cracks from the heat. If paper 
or parchment is stained, a broad varnish 
brush should be employed to lay the 
colouring on evenly. When the stains 
for icood are required to be very strong, 
it is better to soak and not brush them ; 
therefore, if for inlaying or fine work, 
the wood should be previously split or 
sawn into proper thicknesses, and 
when directed to be brushed several 
times over with the stains, it should be 
allowed to dry between each coating. 
When it is wished to render any of the 
stains more durable and beautiful, the 
work should be well rubbed with Dutch 
or common rushes after it is coloured, 
and then varnished with seed-lac var- 
nish, or if a better appearance is desired, 
with three coats of the same, or shellac 
varnish. Common work only requires 
frequent rubbing with linseed oil and 
woollen rags. The remainder, with the 
exception of glass, will be treated of 



in this paper.

MARBLE, and 



STONE, may be stained of a yellow 7 , 
red, green, blue, purple, black, or any 
of the compound colours, by the stains 



used for wood.

Black. I. 



Lay the 'articles for several hours in a 
strong solution of nitrate of silver, and 
expose to the light. 2. Boil the article 
for some time in a strained decoction 
of logwood, and then steep it in a solu- 
tion of per-sulphate or acetate of iron. 
3. Immerse frequently in ink, until of 
sufficient depth of colour. 

361. Blue. 1. Immerse for some 
time in a dilute solution of sulphate of 
indigo partly saturated with potash 
nd it will be fully stained. 2 Steep 
in a strong solution of sulj late of 
copper. 



362. Green. 1. Dip blue-stained ar- 
ticles for a short time in nitro-bydro- 
chlorate of tin, and then in a hot de- 
coction of fustic. 2. Boil in a solution 
of verdigris in vinegar until the desired 
colour is obtained. 

363. Red.l . Dip the articles first 
in the tin mordant used in dyeing, and 
theu plunge into a hot decoction of 
Brazil wood half a pound to a gallon 
of water or cochineal. 2. Steep in 
red ink until sufficiently stained. 

364. &:arlet. Use lac-dye instead 
of the preceding.

and then immerse in a decoction 
logwood. 

366. Yellow. 1. Impregnate with 
nitro hydro chlorate of tin, and then 
digest with heat in a strained decoction 
of fustic. 2. Steep for twenty-four 
hours in a strong solution of the neu 
tral chromate of potash, and then 
plunge for some time in a boiling solu- 
tion of acetate of lead. 3. Boil the 
articles in a solution of alum a pound 
to half a gallon and then immerse for 
half an hour in the following mixture : 
Take half a pound of turmeric, and a 
quarter of a pound of pearl-ash ; boil in 
a gallon of w r ater. When taken from 
this, the bone must be again dipped in 
the alum solution. 

367. HORN must be treated in the 
same manner as bone and ivory for the 
various colours given under that head- 
ing. 

368. In Imitation of Tortoise-Shell. 
First steam and then press the horn 
into proper shapes, and afterwards lay 
the following mixture on with a small 
brush, in imitation of the mottle of 
tortoise-shell : Take equal parts of 
quick-lime and litharge, and mix with 
strong soap lees ; let this remain until 
it is thoroughly dry, brush off, and 
repeat two or three, times, if necessary. 
Such parts as are required to be of a 
reddish brown should be covered with 
a mixture of w : hiting and the stain.

stand for a week ; then add a pound of 
dry lamp-black, and three-quarters of 
a pound of copperas ; stir it up for a 
couple of days. Lay five or six coats 
on the gun, &c., with a sponge, allnv- 
ing it to dry well between each. P( lish 
with linseed oil and soft woollen rag, 
and it will look like ebony. 

370. PAPER AND PARCHMENT. 
"Blu.1,. ]. Stain it green with the ver- 
digris stain given below, and brush 
over with a solution of pearl-ash two 
ounces to the pint till it becomes 
blue. 2. Use the blue stain for wood. 

371. Green and Red. The same as 
for wood. 

372. Orange. Brush over with a 
tincture of turmeric, formed by infus- 
ing an ounce of the root in a pint of 
spirit of wine ; let this dry, and give 
another coat of pearl-ash solution, made 
by dissolving two ounces of the salt in 
a quart of water. 

373. Purple. 1. Brush over with 
the expressed juice of ripe privet ber- 
ries. 2. The same as for wood. 

374. Yellow. I. Brush over with 
tincture of turmeric. 2. Add anatto 
or dragon's-blood to the tincture of tur- 
meric, and brush over as usual. 

375 WOOD. Black. 1. Drop a 
little sulphuric acid into a small quan- 
tity of water, brush over the wood and 
hold it to the fire ; it will be a fine black, 
and receive a good polish. 2. Take 
half a gallon of vinegar, an ounce of 
bruised nut-galls, of logwood chips and 
copperas each half a pound boil well ; 
add half an ounce of the tincture of 
sesquichloride of iron, formerly called 
the muriated tincture, and brash on 
hot. 3. Use the stain given for ships' 
guns. 4. Take half a gallon of vinegar, 
half a pound of dry lamp-black, and 
three pounds of iron-rust sifted. Mix, 
and let stand for a week. Lay three 
coats of this on hot, and then rub with 
linseed oil, and you will have a fine 
deep black. 5. Add to the a"bove stain 
an ounce of nut-galls, half a pound of 
logwood chips, and a quarter of a pound 
of copperas ; lay ;>n three coats, oi] 
Well, and you wil have a black stain 



;hat will stand any kind of weather, 
and one that is well suited for ships' 
combings, &c. 6. Take a pound of 
ogwood chips, a quarter of a pound of 
Brazil wood, and boil for an hour and 
a half in a gallon of water. Brush the 
wood several times with this decoction 
while hot Make a decoction of nut- 
alls by simmering gently for three or 
our dstys a quarter of a pound of the 
galls in two quarts of water ; give the 
wood three coats of this, and while wet 
on a solution of sulphate of iron 
two ounces to a quart), and when dry 
oil or varnish. 7. Give three coats 
with a solution of copper filings in 
aquafortis, and repeatedly brush over 
with the logwood decoction, until the 
greenness of the copper is destroyed. 
3. Boil half a pound of logwood chips 
n two quarts of water, add an ounce 
of pearl-ash, and apply hot with a 
brush. Then take two quarts of the 
[ogwood decoction, and half an ounce 
of verdigris, and the same of copperas ; 
strain, and throw in half a pound of 
iron rust. Brush the work well with 
this, and oil. 

376. Blue. 1. Dissolve copper filings 
in aquafortis, brush the wood with it, 
and then go over the work with a hot 
solution of pearl-ash (two ounces to a 
pint of water), till it assumes a per- 
fectly blue colour. 2. Boil a pound of 
indigo, two pounds of woad, and three 
ounces of alum in a gallon of water ; 
brush well over until thoroughly 
stained. 

377. In imitation of Botany-Bay 
Wood. Boil half a pound of French 
berries (the unripe berries of the rham- 
nus infectorius), in two quarts of water 
till of a deep yellow, and while boiling 
hot give two or three coats to the 
work. If a deeper colour is desired, 
give a coat of logwood decoction over 
the yellow. When nearly dry, form, 
the grain with No. 8 black stain, used 
hot, and when dry rust and varnisiu

blood, bruised, into a quart of oil of 
turpentine ; let the bottle stand in a 
warm place, shake frequently, and, 
xv hen dissolved, steep the work in the 
mixture. 

:?80. Light Red Brown. Boil half a 
pound of madder and a quarter o a 
pound of fustic in a gallon of water ; 
brush over the work when boiling-hot, 
until properly stained. 2. The surface 
of the work being quite smooth, brush 
over with a weak solution of aquafortis, 
half an ounce to the pint, and then finish 
with the following: Put four ounces 
and a half of dragon's-blood and an 
ounce of soda, both well bruised, to 
three pints of spirit of wine, let it stand 
in a warm place, shake frequently, 
strain, and lay on with a soft brash, re- 
peating until of a proper colour ; polish 
with linseed oil or varnish. 

881. Purple. Brush the work seve- 
ral times with the logwood decoction 
used for No. 6 black, and when dry give 
a coat of pearl-ash solution, one drachm 



care to lav it on 



to a quart, taking 
evenly. 

382. Red. I. Boil a pound of Brazil 
wood and an ounce of pearl- ash in a 
gallon of water, and while hot brush 
over the work until of a proper colour. 
Dissolve two ounces of alum in a quart 
of water, and brush the solution over 
the work before it dries. 2. Take a gal- 
lon of the above stain, add two more 
ounces of pearl-ash ; use hot, and brush 
often with the alum solution. 3. Use 
a cold infusion of archil, and brush 
over with the pearl-ash solution used 
for No. 1 dark mahogany 

383. In imitation of Eosewood, 1 . 
Boil half a pound of logwood in three 
pints of water till it is of a very dark 
red, add half an ounce of salt of tartar ; 
Btain the work with the liquor while 
boiling hot, giving three coats; then 
with a painter's gaming brush, form 



cane, braised at the end, apply the iron- 
filing solution in the form required, and 
polish with bees-wax and turpentine 
when dry, or varnish. 

384. Yellow. I. Brush over with tho 
tincture of turmeric. 2. Warm the 
work, and brush over with weak aqua- 
fortis, then hold to the fire. Varnish or 
oil as usual. 

385. CURE OF WARTS. Dr. 
Lawrence, says, the easiest way to get 
rid of warts is to pare off the thicken- 
ed skin which covers the prominent 
wart ; cut it off by successive layers : 
shave it till you come to the surface of 
the skin, and till you draw blood in two 
or three places. When you have thus 
denuded the surface of the skin, rub 
the part thoroughly over with lunar 
caustic, and one effective operation of 
this kind will generally destroy the 
wart ; if not, you cut off the black spot 
which has been occasioned by the caus- 
tic, and apply it again; or you may ap- 
ply acetic acid, and thus you will get 
rid of it. 

386. TO REMOVE FRECKLES. 
Dissolve, in half an ounce of lemon- 
juice, one ounce of Venice soap, and 
add a quarter of an ounce each of oil Oi 
bitter almonds, and deliquated oil oi 
tartar. Place this mixture in the sun 
till it acquires the consistency of oint- 
ment. When in this state add three 
drops of the oil of rhodium, and keep it 
for use. Apply it to the face and hands 
in the manner following : Wash the 
parts at night with elder-flower water,, 
then anoint with the ointment. In the 
morning cleanse the skin from its oily 
adhesion by washing it copiously in 
rose-water. 

387. DIRECTIONS FOR PUT 
TING ON GUTTA PERCHA 
SOLES. Dry the old sole, and rougfc 
it well with a rasp, after which, put on 
a thin coat of warm solution with thf

Ill 



finger, rub it well in ; let it dry, then 
hold it to the fire, and, whilst warm, 
put on a second coat of solution thicker 
than the first, let it dry. Then take 
the gutta-percha sole, and put it in hot 
water until it is soft ; take it out, wipe 
it, and hold the sole in one hand and 
the shoe in the other to the fire, and 
they will become sticky ; immediately 
;y the sole on, beginning 1 at the toe, 
nnd proceed gradually In half an hour, 
take- a knife and pare .i. The solution 
(should be warmed by putting as much 
as you want to use in a cup, and plac- 
ing it iu hot water, taking care that no 
water mixes with the solution. 

338. COD LIVER OIL. Cod- 
liver oil is neither more nor less than 
cod-oil clarified ; and consequently two- 
thirds of its medicinal qualities are 
abstracted thereby. Cod-oil can be pur- 
chased pure at any wholesale oil ware- 
aouse, at about one-thirtieth part of 
ihe price charged for the so-called cod- 
>if er oil. Many persons who have used 
jod-oil pure as imported, have found it 
to answer much better than the cod- 
liver oil purchased of a druggist. The 
beet vehicle for taking cod liver oil in 
is new milk, and the disagreeable fla- 
vour of the drug can easily be covered 
by the addition of one drachm of orange- 
peel to every eight ounces of the oil. 

389. TO BOTTLE FRUITS. 
Burn a match in a bottle to exhaust all 
air, then place in the fruit to be pre- 
served, quite dry, and without blemish ; 
sprinkle sugar between each layer, put 
in the bung, and tie bladder over, set- 
ting the bottles bung downwards, in a 
large stew-pan of cold water, with hay 
between to prevent breaking. When 
the skin is just cracking, take them out. 
All preserves require exclusion from 
the air ; place a piece of paper dipped 
in sweet oil over the top of the fruit ; 
prepare thin paper, immersed in gum- 
wfifcor, and, while wet, press it over and 
Around the top of the jar; as it dries, it 
will become quite firm and tight. 

390. TO CLEAN CANE-BOTTOM 
CHAIRS Turn up the chair bot- 
toio, &c and \*'tb hot water fnd a 



sponge wash the cane-work well, go 
that it may become completely soaked. 
Should it be very dirty you must add 
soap. Let it dry in the open air, if pos- 
sible, or in a place where there is a 
thorough draught, and it will become 
as tight and firm as when new, provid 
ing that it has not been broken. 

391. TEETHING. Young children 
whilst cutting their first set of teeth 
often suffer severe constitutional dis- 
turbance. At first there is restlessness 
and peevishness, with slight fever, but 
not unfrequently these are followed by 
convulsive fits, as they are commonly 
called, which depend on the brain be- 
coming irritated: and sometimes under 
this condition the child is either cut off 
suddenly, or the foundation of serious 
mischief to the brain is laid. The 
remedy, or rather the safeguard, against 
these frightful consequences is trifling, 
safe, and almost certain, and consists 
merely in lancing the gum covering the 
tooth which is making its way through, 
When teething is about it may be knowr 
by the spittle constantly drivelling 
from the mouth and wetting the frock 
The child has its fingers often in it* 
niouth, and bites hard any substance 
it can get hold of. If the gums be 
carefully looked at, the part where tht 
tooth is pressing up is swollen am 
redder than usual ; and if the finger be 
pressed on it the child shrinS i and cries 
showing that the gum is tender. Whei 
these symptoms occur, the gum shouk 
be lanced, and sometimes the tooth 
comes through the next day, if near the 
surface ; but if not so far advanced thr 
cut heals and a scar forms, which is 
thought by some objectionable, as 
rendering the passage of the tooth more 
difficult. This, however, is untrue, for 
the scar will give way much more 
easily than the uncut gum. If the 
tooth do not come through after two 
or three days, the lancing may bo re- 
peated ; and this is more especially 
needed if the child be very fractious, 
and seem in much pain. Lancing the 
gums is further advantageous, because 
it empties the inflamed part of it*

blood, and so relievo* the pain and 
inflammation. The relief children ex 
perience in the course of two or three 
hours from the operation is often very 
remarkable, as they almost immediately 
become lively and cheerful. 

39-2. TO MAKE ANCHOVIES 
To a pock of sprats put two pounds of 
fait, three ounces of bay salt, one pound 
of saltpetre, two ounces of prunella, 
and a few grains of cochineal ; pound 
them all in a mortar, then put into a 
stone p;m or anchovy ban-el, first a 
layer of sprats, and then one of the 
compound, and so on alternately to the 
top. Press them down hard ; cover 
them close for six months, and they 
will be fit for use, and will readily 
produce a most excellent flavoured 
sauce. A large trade is done in this 
article, especially for making anchovy 
oaste or sauce, when a little more co- 
louring is added. 

393. EYELASHES. The mode 
adopted by the beauties of the East to 
increase the length and strength of 
their eyelashes is simply to clip the 
split ends with a pair of scissors about 
once a month. Mothers perform the 
operation on their children, both male 
and female, when they are mere infants, 
watching the opportunity whilst they 
sleep ; the practice never fails to 
produce the desired effect. We re- 



commend it to 
fair readers, as 



the attention of our 
a safe and innocent 



means of enhancing the charms which 
BO many of them, no doubt, already 



394. APPLE MARMALADE. 

Peel and core two pounds sub-acid 
apples and put them in an enamelled 
saucepan with one pint of sweet cider, 
or half a pint of pure wine, and one 
pound of crushed sugar, and cook them 
by n gentle heat three hours, or longer, 
until the fruit is very soft, and then 
squeeze it first through a colander and 
then through a sieve. If ujt sufficiently 
sweet, add powdered tag-ar to sui't along with t-he bones and giblets of the 



It is delicious w^hen eaten with milk 
and sfill better with cream. 

395. CHEAP FUEL. One bushel 
of small coal or sawdust, or both mixed 
together, two v bushels of sand, one 
bushel and a-half of clay. Let these 
be mixed together with common water, 
like ordinary mortar ; the mure they 
are stirred and mixed together the 
better ; then make them into balls, or 
with a small mould make them in the 
shape of bricks, pile them in a dry 
place, and % whcn they are hard and 
sufficiently dry they may be used. A 
fire cannot be lighted with them, but 
when the fire is quite lighted, put them 
on behind, with a coal or two in front, 
and they will be found to keep up a 
stronger fire than any fuel of the com 
mon kind. 

396. DOMESTIC YEAST. Ladies 
who are in the habit (and a most lauda- 
ble and comfortable habit it is) of 
making domestic bread, cake, &c., are 
informed that they cau easily manufac 
ture their own yeast by attending to 
the following directions : Boil one 
pound of good flour, a quarter of a 
pound of brown sugar, and a little salt, 
in two gallons of water, for one hour. 
When milk warm, bottle it, and cork it 

It will be fit for use in twenty 
four hours. One pint of this yeast will 
make ISlbs. of bread. 

397. COLD PARTRIDGE PIE. 
Bone partridges, the number accord- 
ing to the size the pie is wanted, make 
some good force, and fill the partridges 
with it: put a whole raw truffle in 
each partridge, (let the truffle be peel- 
ed), raise the pie, lay a few slices oC 
veal in the bottom, 'and a thick layer 
of force ; then the partridges, and four 
;ruflles to each partridge ; then cover 
;he partridges and truffles over with 
sheets of bacon, cover the pie in and 
finish it. It will take four hours bak- 

ng. Cut two pounds of lean ham (if 
nglit partridges are in the pie) into 
very thin slices, put it in a stewpan 



your taste, and put aw T ay in jars made 
airtight by u piece of wet bladder, 



partridges, and any other loose giblets

of thyme and parsley, a little mace, and 
about twenty-four shalots ; add about 
a pint of stock. Set the stewpan on a 
stove to draw down for half-an-hour, 
then put three quarts of good etock ; 
let it boil for two hours, then strain it 
off, and reduce the liquid to one pint ; 
add sherry wine to it, and put aside 
till the pie is baked. When the pie 
has been out of the oven for half-an- 
hour, boil what was strained from the 
bones, &c. of the partridges, and put 
it into the pie. Let it stand for 
twenty-four hours before it is eaten. 
N.B. Do not take any of the fat from 
the pie, as that is what preserves it. 
A pie made in this manner will be eat- 
able for three months after it is cut ; 
in short, it cannot spoil in any reason- 
able time. All cold pies are made in 
this manner. Either poultry or game 
that is put into a raised crust, and in- 
tended not to be eaten until cold, 
should be boned, and the liquor that is 
to fill up the pie made from the bones, 
&c. 

398. TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE 
IN A CHIMNEY. So many serious 
fires have been caused by chimneys 
catching fire, and not being quickly ex- 
tinguished, that the following method 
of doing this should be made generally 
known. Throw some powdered brim- 
stone on the fire in the grate, or ignite 
some on the hob, and then put a board 
or something in the front of the fire- 
place, to prevent the fumes descending 
into the room. The vapour of the 
brimstone ascending the chimney, will 
then effectually extinguish the soot on 
fire. (See 28.) 

399. SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. 
Any remedy is doubtful ; many of 
those commonly used are dangerous. 
The safest plan is as follows : The 
hairs should be perseveringly plucked 
up by the roots, and the skin, having 
been washed twice a-day with warm 
eoft water, without soap, should be 
treated with the following wash, com- 
monly called MILK OF ROSES. Beat 
four ounces of sweet almonds in a mor- 
tar, an ^ add half an ounce of white 



sugar during the process ; reduce the 
whole to a paste by pounding ; then 
add, in small quantities at a time, eight 
ounces of rose water. The emulsion 
thus formed, should be strained through 
a fine cloth, and the residue again 
pounded, while the strained fluid should 
be bottled in a large stopped vial. Tf 
the pasty mass in the mortar add half 
an ounce of sugar, and eight ounces of 
rose water, and strain again. This 
process must be repeated three times. 
To the thirty -two ounces of fluid, add 
twenty grains ofthe bichloride of mer- 
cury, dissolved in two ounces of alcohol, 
and shake the mixture for five minutes. 
The fluid should be applied with a 
towel, immediately after washing, and 
the skin gently rubbed with a dry- 
cloth till perfectly dry. Wilson, in his 
work on Healthy Skin, writes as fol- 
lows : " Substances are sold by the 
perfumers called depilatories, which 
are represented as having the power 
of removing hair. But the hair is not 
destroyed by these means ; the root and 
that part of the shaft implanted with- 
in the skin still remain, and are ready 
to shoot up with increased vigour as 
soon as the depilatory is withdrawn. 
The effect of the depilatory is the 
same, in this respect, as that of a razor, 
and the latter is, unquestionably, the 
better remedy. It must not, however, 
be imagined that depilatories are nega- 
tive remedies, and that, if they do no 
permanent good, they are, at least, 
harmless ; that is not the fact, they are 
violent irritants, and require to be used 
with the utmost caution. ******** 
After all, the safest depilatory is a pair 
of tw r eezers and patience." 

400. DISINFECTING LIQUID. 
In a wine bottle of cold water, dissolve 
two ounces acetate of lead (sugar of 
lead ;) and then add two (fluid) ounces 
of strong nitric acid ( aquafortis ). 
Shake the mixture and it will be ready 
for u.se. A very small quantity ofthe 
liquid, in its strongest form, should be 
used for cleansing all kinds of chamber 
utensils. For removing offensive odors 
clean cloths thoroughly moistened witb

the liquid, diluted with eight or tt-n 
parts of 'water, should be suspended at 
various parts of the room. In this case 
the of Ion sire and deleterious gases are 
neutralized by chemical action. Fumi- 
gation in the usual way is only the sub- 
stitution of one odour for another. In 
itsing the above, or any other disinfect- 
ant, let it never be forgotten that/res/t 
'iir and plenty of it, is cheaper and 
more effective than any other ma- 
terial. 

401. CLEANLINESS."! have 
more than once expressed my convic- 
tion that the humanizing influence of 
habits of cleanliness arid of those decent 
observations which imply self-respect 
best, indeed the only foundation of re- 
spect for others has never been suffi- 
ciently acted on. A clean, fresh, and 
well ordered house exercises over its 
inmates a moral no less than a physical 
influence, and has a direct tendency to 
make the members of a family sober, 
peaceable, and considerate of the feel- 
ings and happiness of each other; nor 
is it difficult to trace a connexion be- 
tween habitual feeling of this sort and 
the formation of habits of respect for 
property, for the laws in general, and 
even for those higher duties and obliga- 
tions the observance of which no laws 
can enforce." (-See 878.) 

402. DYEING. The filaments from 
which shifts of all kinds are fabricated, 
are derived either from the animal or 
the vegetable kingdom. We recognise 
the former by the property they possess 
of liberating ammonia on being treated 
with potash ; while the latter afford a 
liquor having no acid reaction under 
the same treatment. The animal king- 
dom furnishes three varieties silk, 
wool, and the furs, &c., of various ani- 
mals; the vegetable kingdom also 
three flax, hemp, and cotton : all of 
which require certain preliminary pre- 
parations to render them fit for the 
dyer, which do not come within our 
province, our space only admitting of 
a rapid glance at the production of the 
rarious colours. 

403. GENERAL OHSERYATIONS. 



The various shades produced by colour 
ing matters may be chi^t-d in one or 
other of the following group : 



1. Blues 

2. Reds 

3. Yellows 

4. Violets 

5. Orange colours 

6. Greens 

7. Compound colours 

8. Black. 



Simple. 



Binary 
Ternary, 



Some colours adhere at once to the 
stuff, and are substantial colours: while 
others require that the material to be 
dyed should undergo some previous 
preparation in order to render it per 
manent. The substance used to fix 
the colouring matters are called mor 
dants, which should possess four quali- 
fications : 1, They should possess an 
equal affinity for the fibre of the mate- 
rial and the colouring matter. 2. They 
should be incapable of injuring or des- 
troying either by prolonged action. 3. 
They should form, with the colour, a 
compound capable of resisting tbe 
action of air and water. 4. They 
should be capable of readily conforming 
to the various operations of the dyer. 

404. THE MORDANTS. For tie 
reasons just given, the acetate or tar- 
trate of iron is preferable to the sul- 
phate ; and the acetate or tartrate of 
alumina to alum. 

405. For rtds, yellows, greens, ana 
pinks. Aluminous mordants are to be 
used. 

406. For Hacks, Iroicns, putes, and 
violets. The acetate or tartrate of iron 
must be employed. 

407. For scarlets use a tin mordant 
made by dissolving in strong nitric acid 
one-eighth of its weight of sal-ammo 
niac ; then adding by degrees one- 
eighth of its weight in tin, and diluting 
the solution with one-fourth of its weight 
of water. 

408. CALICO, LINEN, AND MUSLIN 
Blue. Wash well to remove dressing, 
and dry ; then dip in a strong solution 
of sulphate of indigo partly saturated 
with potash and hang up. Pry 9

piece to see if the colour is deep 
enough, if not, dip again. 

409. Saxon Blue. Boil the article 
in alum, nnd then dip in a strong solu- 
tion of chemie blue. 

410. Buff. Boil an ounce of anatto 
in three quarts of water, and two ounces 
of potash, stir well, and put in the cali- 
co while boiiing, and stir well for five 
minutes; remove and plunge into cold 
pump water, hang up the articles with- 
out wringing, and when almost dry, 
fold. 

411. Pink. Immerse in the acetate 
of alumina mordant, and then in the 
colouring matter of a pink saucer. 

412. Green. Boil the article in an 
alum mordant, and then in a solution of 
indigo mixed with any of the yellow 
dyes, until the proper colour is ob- 
tained. 

413. Yellow. I. Cut potatoe tops 
when in flower, and express the juice ; 
steep articles in this for forty-eight 
hours. 2. Dip in a strong solution of 
weld after boiling- in an aluminous mor- 
dant. Turmerie, fustic, anatto, &c., 
will answer the same as weld 

414. CLOTH, Black. Impregnate 
the material with the Rotate of iron 
mordant, and then boil in a decoction 
of madder and logwood. 

415. Madder Red. Boil the cloth in 
a weak solution of pearl-ash an ounce 
to a gallon of water wash, dry, and 
then steep in a decoction of bruised 
nutgalls. After dyeing, it is to be 
steeped twice in warm alum water, 
then dried and boiled in a decoction 
made of three-quarters of a pound of 
madder to every pound of the article. 
It should then be taken out and dried, 
and steeped in a second bath in the 
same manner. When dyed, the articles 
should be washed in warm soap and 
water, to remove a dun-coloured matter 
given out by the madder. 

416. Scarlet. Three-quarters of a pint 
of a tin mordant, made by dissolving 
three pounds of tin in sixty pounds of 
hydrochloric acid, is added to every 
pound of lac dye, and digested for six 
hours To dye twenty-five pounds of 



cloth, a tin boiler of seventy-five gal- 
lons capacity should be filled nearly 
full with water, and a fire kindled un 
der it. When the heat is 150 deg. 
Fahr., half a handful of bran and two 
ounces of tin mordant are to be thrown 
into it. The froth which arises is skim- 
med off, the liquor is made to boil, 
and two pounds and three quarters of 
lac dye, previously mixed with a pound 
and three quarters of the solvent, and 
fourteen ounces of the tin solvent are 
added. Immediately afterwards two 
pounds and three-quarters of tartar, 
and a pound of ground sumach, both 
tied up in a linen bag, are to be added 
and suspended in the bath for five 
minutes. The fire being withdrawn, 
five gallons of cold water, and two pints 
and three-quarters of tin mordant being 
poured into the bath, the cloth ig im- 
mersed in it. The fire is then replaced, 
and the liquid made to boil rapidly for 
an hour, when the cloth is removed and 
washed in pure water. 

417. Yellow. Use No. 2. for calico. 
Quercitron and weld produce a solid 
yellow; fustic, a very brilliant tint; 
white turmeric yields a less solid yel 
low. 

418. FEATHERS. Black. Use the 
same as for cloth. 

419. Blue. Every shade may be 
given by indigo or dip in silk dye. 

420. Crimson. Dip in acetate of 
alumina mordant, then in a boiling-hot 
decoction of Brazil wood and, last o! 
all, pass through a bath of cudbear. 

421. Pink, or Rose colour, is given 
by safflower and lemon juice. 

422. Deep red. Proceed as for crim- 
son, omitting the cudbear bath. 

423. Yellow. Mordant with acetate 
of alumina, and dip in a bath of tur 
rneric, or weld. 

424. HAIR. Black. As the object 
in view is simply to dye the hair with- 
out tinging the skin, the following will 
be found the best : Take equal partg 
of litharge and lime ; mix well, and 
form into a paste with water, : a black 
is desired ; with milk, if brown. Clean 
the head with a small-tooth comb, and

then well was.i the hair with soda and 
water to free it from grease ; then lay 
on the paste pretty thick, and cover the 
heaV with oil-skin, or a cabbage-leaf: 
after which go to bed. Next morning 
the powder should be carefully brushed 
away, and the hair (tiled. (Sec 270, 271.) 

425. LEATHER. Black. Use No. 4 
Black stain, and polish with oil. 

426. Gloves, Nankeen. Steep saffron 
in boiling hot soft water for about 
twelve hours ; sew up the tops of the 
gloves, to prevent the dye staining the 
insides, wet them over with a sponge 
dipped in the liquid. A tea-cupful of 
dye will do a pair of gloves. 

427. Gloves, Purple. Boil four oun- 
ces of logwood, and two ounces of foche 
alum, in three pints of soft water, till 
half wasted; strain, and let it cool. 
Sew up the tops, go over the outsides 
with a brush or sponge twice ; then 
rub off the loose dye with a coarse 
cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, 
and rub it over the leather with a 
Bponge. Vinegar will remove the stain 
from the hands. 

428. SILK. Black. Use the same 
as for cloth, but black dyeing is diffi- 
cult. 

429. Blue. 1. Wash quite clean, 
rinse well, and then dip in a hot solu- 
tion of sulphate of iron, after a short 
time take it out and rinse again. Have 
ready in another vessel a hot solution of 
prussiate of potash, to which a small 
quantity of sulphuric acid has been 
added. Dip the silk in this liquid; on 
removal rinse in clean water, and ex- 
pose to the air to dry. 2. Wash well, 
rinse, wring out, and then dip in the 
following : Boil a pound of indigo, 
two pounds of woad, and three ounces 
of alum in a gallon of water. When the 
silk is of a proper colour, remove, rinse, 
and dry. 

430. Carnation. Boil two gallons of 
wheat and an ounce of alum in four 
gallons of water, strain through a h'rie 
sieve ; dissolve half a pound more of 
alum and white tartar; add three 
pounds of madder, then put in the silk 
it a moderate heat. 



431. Madder Rcd.Uw the dye for 
cloth. 

4;W. Fe/foic. Take clear wheat bran 
iquor fifteen pounds, in which dissolve 
hree quarters of a pound of alum 
joil the silk in this for two hours, and 
afterwards take half a pound of weld 
aud boil it till the colour is good. Nitre 
used with alum and water in the first 
ooiling fixes the colour. 

433. WOOL. Blue. Boil in a de- 
coction of logwood, and sulphate or 
acetate of copper. 

434. Broicn. Steep in an infusion of 
green walnut peels. 

435. Drab. Impregnate with brown 
oxide of iron, and then dip in a bath of 
quercitron bark. If sumach is added, it 
will make the colour a dark brown. 

436. Green. First imbue with tho 
blue, and then with the yellow dye. 

437. Orange. Dye first with the red 
dye for cloth, and then with a yellow. 

438. Red. Take four and a half 
pounds of cream of tartar, four and a 
quarter pounds of alum ; boil the wool 
gently for two hours ; let it cool, and 
wash the following- day in pure water 
Infuse twelve pounds of madder for 
half an hour with a pound of chloride 
of tin in lukewarm water, filter through 
canvas, remove the dye from the can- 
vas, and put in the bath, which is to be 
heated to 100 deg. Fahr.; add two 
ounces of aluminous mordant, put the 
wool in, and raise to boiling heat. Ke- 
move the wool, wash, and soak for a 
quarter of an hour in a solution of 
white soap in water. 

439. Yellow. Dye with that used 
for calico, &c. 

440. CALF'S HEAD PIE. Bo^ 
the head an hour and a half, or rather 
more. After dining from it, cut the re- 
maining meat off in slices. Boil the bones 
in a little of the liquor for three hours; 
then strain it off, and let it remain till 
next day; then take off the ft. To 
make the Pie. Boil two eggs for five 
minutes ; let them get cold, then lay 
them in slices at the bottom of a pie- 
dish, and put alternate layers of meat 
and j^lly, with pepper and chopped

lemon also alternately, till the dish is 
full ; cover with a crust and buke it. 
Next day turn the pie out upside 
down. 

441. CARPETS. If the corner of a 
carpet gets loose and prevents the door 
opening, or trips every one up that 
enters the room, nail it down at once. 
A dog's eared carpet marks the sloven 
as well as the dog's-eared book. An 
English gentleman, travelling some 
years ago in Ireland, took a hammer 
and tacks with him, because he found 
dog's-eared carpets at all the inns 
where he rested. At one of these inns 
he tacked down the carpet which, as 
usual, was loose near the door, and 
soon afterwards rang for his dinner. 
While the carpet was loose the door 
could not be opened without a hard 
push : so when the waiter came up, he 
just unlatched the door, and then going 
back a couple of yards, he rushed 
against it, at his habit was, with a 
sudden spring to force it open. But 
the wrinkles of the carpet were no 
longer there to stop it, and not meet- 
ing with the expected resistance, the 
unfortunate waiter fell full sprawl into 
the room. It had never entered his 
head that so much trouble might be 
saved by means of a hammer and half- 
a-dozen tacks, until hie fall taught him 
that make-shift is a very unprofitable 
kind of shift. There are a good many 
houses in the United States where 
a similar practical lesson might be of 
service. 

442. MINCE MEAT. Take seven 
pounds of currants well picked and 
cleaned ; of finely chopped beef suet, 
the lean of a sirloin of beef minced raw, 
and finely chopped apples (Golden Pip- 
pins), each three and a half pounds; 
citron, lemon-peel, and orange-peel 
cut small, each half a pound ; fine 
moist sugar, two pounds ; mixed spice, 
an ounce; the rind of four lemons and 
four Seville oranges ; mix well, and put 
in a deep pan. Mix a bottle of brandy 
and white wine, the juice of the lemons 
and oranges that have been grated, to- 
gether m a basin ; pour half over, and 



press down tight with the hand, then 
add the other half and cover closely. 
Some families make one year to use the 
next. 

443. ELEGANT BREAD PUD- 
DING. Take light white bread, and 
cut in thin slices. Put into a pudding- 
shape a layer of any sort of preserve, 
then a slice of bread, and repeat until 
the mould is almost full. Pour over 
all a pint of warm milk, in which four 
beaten eggs have been mixed ; cover 
the mould with a piece of linen, place 
it in a saucepan with a little boiling 
water, let it boil twenty minutes, and 
serve with pudding-eauce. 

444. CRAB, MOCK. Take any 
required quantity of good fat mellow 
cheese, pound it well in a mortar, 
incorporating made mustard, salad oil, 
vinegar, pepper (cayenne is the best), 
and salt sufficient to season and render 
it about the consistence of the cream 
of a crab. Add and mix well half a 
pint or more of pickled shrimps, and 
sorve in a crab shell, or on a dish, gar- 
nished with slices of lemon. 

445. CURRIED BEEF, MADRAS 
WAY. Take about two ounces of 
butter, and place it in a saucepan, with 
two small onions cut up into slices, and 
let them fry until they are a light 
brown ; then add a table-spoonful and 
a half of curry powder, and mix it up 
well. Now put in the beef cut into 
pieces about an inch square ; pour in 
from a quarter to a third of a pint of 
milk, and let it simmer for thirty 
minutes ; then take it off, and place it 
in a dish, with a little lemon-juice. 
Whilst cooking stir constantly, to pre- 
vent it burning. Send to table with a 
wall of mashed potatoes or boiled rice 
round it. It greatly improves any 
curry to add with the milk a quarter 
of a cocoa-nut, scraped very small, and 
squeezed through muslin with a littlo 
water ; this softens the taste of the 
curry, and, indeed, no curry should be 
made without it. 

446. CHOICE OF FRIENDS.- 
We should ever have it fixed in our 
memories, that by the character ofthotf 



118 



WIT IS THE LIGHTNING OF THE MIND. 



whom ice choose for our friends, our own 
is likely to be formed, and will certainly 
be judged of by the world. We ought 
therefore, to be slow and cautious in 
contracting intimacy ; but when a vir- 
tuous friendship is once established 
we must ever consider it as a. sacred 
engagement. Dr. Blair. 

447.STRASBURG POTTED 
MEAT. Take a pound and a half of 
the rump of beef, cut into dice, and put 
it in an earthen jar, with a quarter of 
a pound of butter at the bottom ; tie the 
jar close up with paper, and set over a 
pot to boil ; when nearly done, add 
cloves, mace, allspice, nutmeg, salt, 
and cayenne pepper to taste ; then boil 
till tender, and let it get cold. Pound 
the meat, with four anchovies washed 
and boned ; add a quarter of a pound 
of oiled butter, work it w r ell together 
with the gravy, warm a little, and add 
cochineal to colour. Then press into 
small pots, and pour melted mutton 
suet over the top of each. 

448. HAMS, TONGUES, &c., 
GLAZING FOR. Boil a shin of beef 
twelve hours in eight or ten quarts of 
water ; draw the gravy from a knuckle 
of veal in the same manner ; put the 
same herbs and spices as if for soup, 
and add the whole to the shin of beef. 
It must be boiled till reduced to a 
quart. It will keep good for a year ; 
and when wanted for use, warm a 
little, and spread over the ham, tongue, 
&c., with a feather. 

449. BOLOGNA SAUSAGES. 
Take equal quantities of bacon, fat and 
lean, beef, veal, pork, and beef suet ; 
chop them small, season with pepper, 
salt, &c., sweet herbs and sage rubbed 
fine. Have a well-washed intestine, 
fill, and prick it; boil gently for an 
hour, and lay on straw to dry. They 
may be smoked the same as hams. 

450. FRUIT STAINS IN LINEN. 
To remove them, rub the part on 
each side with yellow soap, then tie up 
a piece of pearl-ash in the cloth, &c., 
and soak well in hot water, or boil ; 
afterwards expose the stained part to 
the sun and air until removed. 



451. PRESERVING THE CO 
LOUR OF DRESSES. The colouri 
of merinos, mousseline-de-laines, ging 
hams, chintzes, printed lawns, <&c. f 
may be preserved by using water thai 
is only milk-warm ; making a lather 
with white soap before you put in the 
dress, instead of rubbing it on the ma- 
terial ; and stirring into a first and 
second tub of water a large tablespoon- 
ful of ox-gall. The gall can be obtained 
from the butcher, and a bottle of it 
should always be kept in every house, 
No coloured articles should be allowed 
to remain long in the water. They 
must be washed fast, and then rinsed 
through two cold waters. Into each 
rinsing water, stir a teaspoonful of 
vinegar, which will help to brighten 
the colours; and after rinsing, hang 
them out immediately. When ironing- 
dry (or still a little damp), bring them 
in ; have irons ready heated, and iron 
them at once, as it injures the colours 
to allow them to remain damp too long, 
or to sprinkle and roll them up in a 
covering for ironing next day. If they 
cannot be conveniently ironed imme- 
diately, let them hang till they aia 
quite dry; and then damp and fold 
them on the following day, a quarter 
of an hour before ironing. The best 
way is not to do coloured dresses on 
the day of the general wash, but to 
s;ive them a morning by themselves. 
They should only be undertaken in 
lear bright weather. If allowed to 
freeze, the colours will be irreparably 
injured. We need scarcely say that 
no coloured articles should ever be 
boiled or scalded. If you get from a 
shop a slip for testing the durability of 
colours, give it a fair trial by washing 
it as above ; afterwards, pinning it to 
the edge of a towel, and hanging it to 
dry. Some colours (especially pinks 
and light greens), though they may 
stand perfectly well in washing, will 
change as soon as a warm iron is ap* 
plied to them ; the pink turning pm- 
plish, and the green bluish. No 
coloured article should be smoothed 
with a hot iron. (See 27 42, 115. "i 



PERSEVERANCE IS THE BRIDGE BY WHICH DIFFICULTY IS OVERCOME. 



119 



45;*. SWEET BAGS FOR LINEN. 
Ttedse may be composed of any mix- 
tures jf the following articles : flowers 
dried and pounded ; powdered cloves, 
mace, nutmeg, cinnamon ; leaves 
dried and pounded of mint, balm, 
dragon-wort, southern-wood, ground- 
ivy, laurel, hyssop, sweet marjoram, 
origanum , rosemary ; woods, such as 
cassia, juniper, rhodium, sandal-wood, 
and rose-wood ; roots of angelica, zedo- 
ary, orris ; all the fragrant balsams ; 
ambergris, musk, and civet. These 
latter should be carefully used on 
linen. 

453. WEDDING - RINGS. The 
custom of wearing wedding-rings ap- 
pears to have taken its rise among the 
Romans. Before the celebration of 
their nuptiab, there was a meeting of 
friends at the house of tlje lady's father, 
to settle articles of the marriage con- 
tract, when it was agreed that the 
dowry should be paid down on the 
wedding-day or soon after. On this 
occasion there was commonly a feast, 
at the conclusion of which the man 
gave to the woman as a pledge, a ring, 
which she put on the fourth finger of 
her left hand, because it was believed 
that a nerve reached thence to the heart, 
and a day was then named for the 
marriage . ( See 259 . ) 

454. TO AVOID CATCHING 
COLD. Accustom yourself to the use 
of sponging with cold water every 
morning on first getting out of bed. 
It should be follow ed with a good deal 
of rubbing with a wet towel. It has 
considerable effect in giving tone to the 
skin, and maintaining a proper action 
in it, and thus proves a safeguard to 
the injurious influeace of cold and sud- 
den changes of temperature. Sir 
Astley Cooper said : " The methods by 
which I have preserved my own health 
are temperance, early rising, and 
gponging the body every morning with 
cold water, immediately after getting 
out of bed ; a practice which I have 
adopted for thirty years without ever 
eatchhig cold." 

455. CLEANING JAPANNED 



WAITERS, URNS, &c. Rub on 
with a sponge a little white soap and 
some lukewarm water, aud wash the 
waiter or urn quite clean. Never use 
hot water, as it will cause the japan to 
scale off. Having wiped it dry, 
sprinkle a little Hour over it ; let it 
rest a while, and then rub it with a 
soft dry cloth, and finish with a silk 
handkerchief. If there are white heat 
marks on the waiters, they will be dif- 
ficult to remove. But you may try 
rubbing them with a flannel dipped in 
sweet oil, and afterwards in spirits of 
wine. Waiters and other articles of 
papier mache should be washed with a 

rnge and cold water, without soap, 
dged with flour while damp ; and 
after a while wipe off, and then polish- 
ed with a silk handkerchief. 

456. CEREMONIES. All ceremo- 
nies are in themselves very silly things ; 
but yet a man of the world should 
know them. They are the outworks 
of manners and decency, which would 
be too often broken in upon, if it were 
not for that defence which keeps the 
enemy at a proper distance. It is for 
that reason I always treat fools and 
coxcombs with great ceremony, true 
good-breeding not being a sufficient 
barrier against them. 

457. TO CLEAN LOOKING- 
GLASSES, MIRRORS, &c. If they 
should be hung so high that they can- 
not be conveniently reached, have a 
pair of steps to stand upon; but mind 
that they stand steady. Then take a 
piece of a soft sponge, well washed and 
cleaned from everything gritty, just 
dip it into water and squeeze it out 
again, and then dip it into some spirits 
of wine. Rub it over the glass ; dust 
it over with some powder blue, or 
whiting sifted through muslin; rub it 
lightly and quickly off again, with a 
cloth ; then take a clean cloth, and rub 
it well again, and finish by rubbing it 
with a silk handkerchief. If the glass 
be very large, clean one half at a time, 
as otherwise the spirit of wine will dry 
before it can be rubbed off. If the 
frames are not varnished . the greatest 



120 



SOLITUDE IS TIIE NURSE OF WISDOM. 



care is necessary to keep them quite 
dry, so as not to touch them with the 
sponge, as this will discolour or take oft 
the gilding. To clean the frames, take 
A little raw cotton in the state of wool, 
and rub the frames with it ; this will 
take off all the dust and dirt withm t 
injuring the gilding. If the frames are 
well varnished, nib them with spirit of 
wine, which will take out all spots, and 
give them a fine polish. Varnished 
doors may be done in the same manner. 
Never use any cloth to frames or draw 
ings, or unvarnished oil paintings, when 
cleaning and dusting them. 

458. SCONES. Flour, two pounds; 
bi-carbonate of soda, quarter of an 
ounce ; salt, quarter of an ounce ; sour 
buttermilk, .one pint, more or less. 
Mix to the consistence of light dough, 
and roll out about half an inch thick, 
and cut them out to any shape you 
please, and bake on & girdle over a clear 
fire about ten or fifteen minutes ; turn- 
ing them to brown on both sides or 
they may be done on a hot plate, or 
ironing-stove. A girdle is a thin plate 
of cast iron about twelve or fourteen 
inches in diameter, with a handle at- 
tached to hang it up by. These scones 
are excellent for tea, and may be eaten 
either cold or hot, buttered, or with 
cheese. 

459. UNFERMENTED CAKES, 
ETC. 

460. TEA CAKES. Take of flour, 
one pound ; sugar, one ounce ; butter, 
one ounce ; muriatic acid, two drachms ; 
bi-carbonate of soda, two drachms ; 
milk, six ounces; water, six ounces. 
Rub the butter into the flour ; dissolve 
the sugar and soda in the milk, and the 
acid in the water. First add the milk. 
&c., to the flour, and partially mix ; 
then the water and acid, and mix well 
together; divide into three portions, 
and bake twenty-five minutes. Flat 
round tins or earthen pans are the best 
to bake them in. If the above is made 
with baking powder, a teaspoonful may 
be substituted for the acid and soda in 
the above receipt, and all the other di- 
rections carried out as stated above. 



If buttermilk is used, the acid, mill 
and water, must be left our. 

461. UXFKKMP.XTKD CAKE. Tak<% 

of flour, one pound and a half; bi-car- 
bonate of soda, three drachms ; muriatic 
acid, three drachms ; sugar, one ounce 
and a half; butter, one ounce and a 
half; milk, twenty ounces; currants, 
six ounces, more or less. Mix the soda 
and butter into the flour by rubbing 
them together ; next dissolve the sugar

the tin if preferred. 

471. PASTRY FOR TARTS, &c. 
Take of flour one pound ; bi-carbonate 
of soda, two drachms ; muriatic acid, 
two drachms; butter, six ounces. Wa- 
ter enough to bring it to the consistence

472. BREAD PUDDING. Unfer- 
mented brown bread, two ounces; milk, 
half a pint ; one egg ; sugar, quarter of 
an ounce. Cut the bread iiuo slices, 
and pour the milk over it boiling hot ; 
let it stand till well soaked, and stir in 
the egg and sugar, well beaten, with a 
little grated nutmeg ; and bake or steam 
for one hour. 

473. SUGAR-BISCUITS. Cut the 
butter into the flour. Add the sugar 
and carraway seeds. Pour in the bran- 
dy, and then the milk. Lastly, put in 
the pearl-ash. Stir all well with a knife, 



and mix it thoroughly, till it becornei 
a lump of dough. " Flour your paste- 
board, and lay the dough on it. Knead 
it very well. Divide it into eight 01 
ten pieces, and knead each piece sepa- 
rate iy. Then put them all together, 
and knead them very well into one 
lump. Cut the dough in half, and roll 
it out into sheets, about half an inch 
thick. Beat the sheets of dough very 
hard on both sides with the rolling-pin. 
Cut them out into round cakes with the 
edge of a tumbler. Butter iron pans, 
and lay the cakes in them. Bake them 
of a very pale brown. If done too 
much, they will lose their taste. Let 
the oven be hotter at the top than at 
the bottom. These cakes kept in a 
stone jar, closely covered from the air, 
will continue perfectly good for several 
months. 

474. BALLS AND EVENING 

PARTIES. 

475. An invitation to a ball should 
be given at least a week beforehand. 

476. Upon entering, first address 
the lady of the house ; and after her, 
the nearest acquaintances yc<i may 
recognize in the house. 

477. If you introduce a friend, make 
him acquainted with the names of the 
chief persons present. But first pre- 
sent him to the lady of the house, and 
to the host. 

478. Appear in full dress. 

479. Always wear gloves. 

480. Do not wear rings on the out- 
side of your gloves. 

481. Avoid an excess of jewellery. 

482. Do not select the same partner 
frequently. 

483. Distribute your attention as 
much as possible. 

484. Pay respectful attention to el- 
derly persons: 

485. Be cordial when serving refresh- 
ments, but not wnportunate. 

486. If there art* more dancers than 
the room will nceommoil;>if>, do not 
join in every dance 

487. In leaving a large party it is 
unnecessary to bid farewell, and im- 
proper to do so before the gueste. 



122 



BE NOT T1IE FIRST TO QUARREL WITH A FRIEND. 



488. A Paris card of invitation to an 
evening party usually implies that you 
are invited for the season. 

489. In balls and large parties there 
should be a table for cards, and two 
packs of cards placed upon each table. 

490. Chess and all unsociable games 
should be avoided. 

491. Although many persons do not 
Hke to play at cards except for a stake, 
the stakes agreed to at parties should 
be very trifling, so as not to create ex- 
citement or discussion. 

492. The host and hostess should 
look after their guests, and not confine 
their attentions. They should, in fact, 
assist those chiefly who are the least 
known in the room. 

493. Avoid political and religious 
discussions. If you have a " hobby," 
keep it to yourself. 

494. After dancing, conduct -your 
partner to a seat. 

495. Resign her as soon as her next 
partner advances. 

(For the Figures of Dances, consult 
the Index. See 864.) 

496. TO PEE VENT THE SMOK- 
ING OF A LAMP. Soak the wick in 
strong vinegar, and well dry it before 
you use it. 

497. EGGS MAY BE PRE- 
SERVED by applying with a brush a 
solution of gum-arabic to the shells, and 
afterward packing them in dry char- 
coal dust. 

498. TO RENDER SHOES WA- 
TER-PROOF. Warm a little bees- 
wax and -mutton suet until it is liquid, 
and rub some of it slightly over the ed- 
ges of the sole where the stitches are. 
(See 70.) 

499. TO CLEAN CANE CHAIRS. 
Sponge them until soaked, with soap 
and hot water. 

500. MARBLE MAY BE CLEAN- 
ED by mixing up a quantity of the 
strongest soap-lees with quick-lime, to 
the consistence of milk, and laying it on 
the marble for twenty -four hours ; clean 
it afterwards with soap and water. 

501. A GREEN PAINT FOR 
GARDEN-STANDS, &c., may be ob- 



tained by mixing a (quantity of mineral 
green and white lead, ground in turpen- 
tine^ with a small portion of turpentine 
varnish for the first coat; for the second 
put as much varnish in the colour aw 
will produce a good gloss. 

502. INK-SPOTS may be taken out 
of mahogany by applying spirits of salt. 

503. STAINS may be removed from 
the hands by washing them in a small 
quantity of oil of vitriol and cold water 
without soap. 

504. WAX may be taken out of cloth 
by holding a red-hot iron within an inch 
or two of the marks, and afterward 
rubbing them with a soft clean rag. 

505. SILK ARTICLES should not 
be kept folded in white papers, as the 
chloride of lime used in bleaching the 
paper will impair the colour of the 
silk. 

506. MILDEWED LINEN may be 
restored by soaping the spots, while 
wet, covering them with tine chalk 
scraped to pow r der, and well rubbed in. 

507. TO TAKE INK-STAINS 
OUT OF A COLOURED TABLE- 
COVER, Dissolve a teaspoonful of 
oxalic acid in a tea-cup of hot water ; 
rub the stained part well with the so- 
lution. 

508. BURN. The first application 
to a burn should be sweet oil, putting it 
on immediately, till other remedies can 
be prepared. 

509. A HALF-WORN CARPET 
may be made to last longer by ripping 
it apart and transposing the breadths. 

510. MEDICINE STAINS may be 
removed from silver spoons by rubbing 
them with a rag dipped in sulphuric 
acid, and washing it off with soap- 

511. PAPIER-MACHE articles 
should be washed with a sponge and 
cold water without soap, dredged with 
flour while damp, and polished with a 
flannel. 

512. TO L O O S E N A GLASS 
STOPPER. Pour round it a little 
sweet oil close to the mouth of th 
bottle, and lay it near the fire ; after- 
wards wrap a thick cloth round the end 



ONE DOUBT MAT LEAI> TO DISBELIEF. 



123 



of a stick and strike the stopper gently. 
(See 254.) 

513. GLASS should be washed in 
cold water, which gives it a brighter 
and clearer look than when cleansed 
with warm water. 

514. IKON WIPERS. Old soft 
towels, or pieces of old sheets or table- 
cloths, make excellent iron wipers. 

515. TO BLEACH A FADED 
DRESS. Wash it well in hot suds, 
and boil it until the colour seems to be 
gone, then wash, and rinse, and dry it 
in the sun ; if still not quite white 
repeat the boiling. 

511). FLANNEL should always be 
washed with white soap, and in warm 
but not boiling water. 

517. A H A T should be brushed 
every day with a hat-brush, and twice 
a-day in dusty weather. 

518. RINGS that have stones in 
them should always be taken off the 
finger when the hands are washed, else 
they become discoloured. 

519. COLD GREEN TEA, very 
strong, and sweetened with sugar, will, 
when set about in saucers, attract flies 
and destroy them. 

520. CLOTHES CLOSETS that 
have become infested with moths 
should be well rubbed with a strong 
decoction of tobacco, and repeatedly 
sprinkled with spirits of camphor. 

521. THE STING OF A NETTLE 
may be cured by rubbing the part with 
rosemary, mint, or sage leaves. 

522. CHARCOAL FUMES. The 
usual remedies for persons overcome 
with the fumes of charcoal in a close 
apartment arc, to throw cold water on 
the head and to bleed immeuiately ; 
also apply mustard or hartshorn to the 
soles of the feet. 

523. AN EVER-DIRTY 
HEARTH, and a grate always choked 
with cinders and ashes, are infallible 
evidences of bad house-keeping. 

524. TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE 
in the chimney, besides any water at 
hand, throw on it salt, or a handful of 
flour of sulphur as soon as you can ob- 
tain it ; keep all the doors and windows 

6 



tightly shut, and hold before the fire- 
place a blanket or some woollen article 
to exclude the air. (See 695.) 

525. READING IN BED at night 
should be avoided, as, besides the 
danger of an accident, it never fails to 
injure the eyes. 

526. IN ESCAPING FROM A 
FIRE, creep or crawl along the room 
with your face close to the ground. 
Children should be early taught how 
to press out a spark when it happens to 
reach any part of their dress, and also 
that running into the air will cause it 
to blaze immediately. (See 695.) 

527. LIME WATER beaten up with 
sweet oil is an excellent ointment for 
burns. 

528. PAPER FIRE-SCREENS 
should be coated with transparent var- 
nish, otherwise they will soon become 
soiled and discoloured. 

529. THE BEST LAMP-OIL ii 
that which is clear and nearly colour- 
less, like water. 

530. OIL-GREASE may be re- 
moved from a hearth by covering it 
immediately with thick hot ashes, or 
with burning coals. 

531. CANDLES improve by keep- 
ing a few months. If wax candles be- 
come discoloured or soiled, they may 
be restored by rubbing them over with 
a clean flannel slightly dipped in spirits 
of wine. 

532. IN LIGHTING CANDLES 
always hold the match to the side of 
the wick, and not over the top. 

533. IN CHOOSING PAPER FOR 
A ROOM, avoid that which has a vari- 
ety of colours, or a large, showy figure, 
as no furniture can appear to advantage 
with such. Large figured papering 
makes a small room look smaller. 

534. FOR KEEPING A DOOR 
OPEN, place a large brick covered 
neatly with a piece of carpeting against 
the door. 

535. A STAIR-CARPET should, 
never be swept down with a lone 
sroorn, but always with a short-handled 
jrush, and a dust-pan held closely un- 
der each step of the etalrg. 



124 



ONE KIND WORD MAY TURN ASIDE A TOKRENT OF ANGER. 



536. OIL-CLOTH should never be 
scrubbed with a brush, but, after being 
first swept, it should be cleansed by 
washing with a Inrge soft cloth and 
lukewarm or cold water. On no ac- 
count use soap or hot water, as either 
will bring oft' the paint. 

537. STRAW-MATTING may be 
cleaned with a large coarse cloth, dip- 
ped in gait and water, and then wiped 
dry : the salt prevents the matting from 
turning yellow. 

538. OIL-PAINTINGS hung over 
the mantel-piece are liable to wrinkle 
with the heat. 

539. OTTOMANS AND SOFAS, 
whether covered with cloth, damask, 
or chintz, will look much the better 
for being cleaned occasionally with 
bran and flannel. 

540. FURNITURE made in the 
winter, and brought from a cold ware- 
house into a warm apartment, is very 
liable to crack. 

541. ROSEWOOD FURNITURE 
should be rubbed gently every day with 
a clean soft cloth to keep it in order. 

542. DINING-TABLES may be po- 
lished by rubbing them for some time 
with a soft cloth and a little cold-drawn 
linseed oil. 

543. IRON- STAINS maybe remov- 
ed from marble by wetting the spots 
with oil of vitriol, or with lemon-juice, 
or with oxalic acid diluted in spirits of 
wine, and, after a quarter of an hour, 
nibbing them dry with a soft linen 
cloth. 

544. SILVER AND PLATED 
WARE should be washed with a 
sponge and warm soapsuds every day 
after using, and w T iped dry with a clean 
soft towel. (S3,149.) 

545. CHINA TEA-POTS are the 
safest, and, in many respects, the most 
pleasant. Wedgwood ware i s very apt, 
after a time, to acquire a disagreeable 
taste. 

r.46. JAPANNED URNS, WAIT- 
ERS, &.c , should be cleaned with a 
Kponue and cold water, finislu'ng with a 
soft dry cloth. 



547. TO CLEAN LOOKING- 
GLASSES. First wush the glass all 
over with lukewarm soap-suds itnd a 
sponge. When dry. rub it brigl/t witb 
a buckskin and a little prepared chalk 
finely powdered. 

548. A MAHOGANY FRAME 
should be first well dusted, and then 
well cleaned with a flannel dipped in 
sweet oil. 

549. BRONZED CHANDELIERS 
LAMPS, &c., should be merely dusted 
with a feather-brush, or w'ith a soft 
cloth, as washing them will takeoff the 
bronzing. 

550. TO CLEAN KNIVES AND 
FORKS. Wash the blades in warm 
(but not hot) water, and afterwards 
rub them lightly over with powdered 
rotten-stone wet to a paste with a little 
cold water, then polish them with a 
clean cloth. 

551. BLACKING FOR STOVES 
may be made with half a pound of 
black lead finely powdered, and (to 
make it stick) mix with it the whites 
of three eggs well beaten ; then dilute 
it with sour beer or porter till it be- 
comes as thin as shoe-blacking ; after 
stirring it, set it over hot coals to sim- 
mer for twenty minutes ; when cold it 
may be kept for use. 

552. FOR CLEANING BRASSES 
belonging to mahogany furniture either 
powdered whiting or scraped rotten- 
stone mixed with sweet-oil and rubbed 
on with a buckskin is good. 

553. THE BEST COVERING for 
a KITCHEN FLOOR is a thick im- 
figured oil-cloth, of one colour. 

554. MEAT may be kept several 
days in the height of summer, sweet 
and good, by lightly covering it with 
bran,, and hanging it in some high or 
windy room, or in a passage where 
there is a current of air. 

555. WHEN VELVET GETS 
FLUSHED from pressure,- hold the 
parts over a basin of hot water, with 
the lining of the dress next -the water ; 
he pile will soon rise and assume ita 

original beauty. 

556. A TIGHT BOOT OR SHOE 



TAKE THINGS ALWAYS BY THE SMOOTH HANDLE. 



125 



goes on easier wheu thoroughly warmed 
by turning the soles next to the fire. 

557. GLASS VESSELS, and other 
utensils, may be purified and cleaned 
by rinsing them out with powdered 
charcoal. 

558. HOUSEHOLDERS would ex- 
ercise a wise precaution against fires by 
directing that the last person up should 
perambulate the premises previous to 
going to bed, to ascertain that all fires 
are sate and lights extinguished. 

559. SHOULD A FIRE BREAK 
OUT in a chimney, a wetted blanket 
should be nailed to the upper ends of 
the mantel piece, so as to cover the 
opening entirely, when the fire will go 
out of itself. (See 524.) 

560. ALL FLANNELS should be 
soaked before they are made up, first 
in cold then in hot water, in order to 
shrink them. 

5G1. WORSTED AND LAMBS'- 
WOOL STOCKINGS should never 
be mended with worsted or lambs'- 
wool, because the latter being new it 
shrinks more than the stockings, and 
draws them up till the toes become 
short and narrow, and .the heels have 
no shape left. 

562. PRESERVED GINGER is 
made by scalding the young roots till 
they become tender, then peeling them 
in cold water, frequently changing the 
water ; and after this they are put into 
a thin syrup, from which, in a few 
days, they are removed to the jars, and 
a rich syrup poured over them. 

563. WHEN MUCH PASTRY IS 
MADE in a house, a good quantity of 
fine flour should be kept on hand, in 
dry jars, and quite secured from the 
air, as it ir.&.kes lighter pastry and 
bread wheu kept a shoit time than 
when quite fresh ground. 

564. TO SOFTEN HARD WA- 
TER, or purify river water, simply 
boil it, and then leave it to atmospheric 
exposure. 

565. WHERE PAINTED WAINS- 
COT, or other wood-work, requires 
cleaning, fuller's earth will be found 
cheap and useful ; and, on wood not 



painted, it forms an excellent substi 
tute for soap. 

5b6. TO DESTROY FLIES in 
room, take half a tea-spoonful 01 black 
pepper in powder, one tea -spoonful ol 
brown sugar, and one table-spoonful i 
creaoa, mix them well together, and 
place them in tho room on a plate, 
where the flies are troublesome, and 
they will soon disappear. 

567. WHERE A CHIMNEY 
SMOKES only when the fire is first 
lighted, it may be guarded against by 
allowing the fire to kindle gradually. 

568. WHENEVER OIL IS USED 
for the purpose of artificial light, it 
should be kept free from all exposure 
to atmospheric air ; as it is apt to ab- 
sorb considerable quantities of oxygen. 
If oil is very coarse or tenacious, a very 
small quantity of oil of turpentine may 
be added. 

569. FAMILY CLOCKS ought 
only to be oiled with the very purest 
oil, purified by a quart of lime water to 
a gallon of oil, in which it has been 
well shaken, and suffered to stand for 
three or four days, when it may be 
drawn off. 

570. TO HEAT A BED at a mo- 
ment's notice, throw a little salt into 
the warming-pan and suffer it to burn 
for a minute .previous to use. 

571. TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER 
A BED BE AIRED. Introduce a 
glass goblet between the sheets for a 
minute or two, just when the warming 
pan is taken out ; if the bed be dry, 
there will only be a slight cloudy ap- 
pearance on the glass, but if not, the 
damp of the bed will assume the more 
formidable appearance of drops, the 
warring of danger. 

572. FLOWERS AND SHRUBS 
should be excluded from a bed-chamber. 

573. WATER of every kind, ex- 
cept rain water, will speedily cover the 
inside of a tea-kettle with an unpleasant 
crust ; this may easily be guarded 
against by placing a clean oyster-shell 
in the tea-kettle, which will always 
keep it in good order, by attracting the 
particles of earth or of stone. 



126 



HOWMCCH PAIN THE EVILS HATE COST US 



574. IN PREPARING TEA a good 
rciK>mist will be careful to have the 
Lx'Kt water, that is, the softest and 
ic'.-isr impregnated with foreign mixture, 
for if tea be infused in hard and in soft 
water, the latter will always yield the 
greatest quantity of the tanning' matter, 
and will strike the deepest black, with 
sulphate of iron in solution. 

r>?5. IN MAKING COFFEE, ob- 
eeiTe that the broader the bottom and 
the smaller the top of the vessel, the 
better it will be. 

5?t>. TO DRIVE AWAY MOTHS 
from clothes, wrap up some yellow or 
turpentine soap in paper ; or place an 
open bottle containing spirits of turpen- 
tine in the wardrobe. 

577. THE WHITE OF AN EGG, 
well beaten with quicklime, and a small 
quantity of very old cheese, forms an 
excellent substitute for cement, when 
wanted in a hurry, either for broken 
china or old ornamental glass ware. 

578. COOKS should be cautioned 
against the iise of charcoal in any 
quantity, except where there is a free 
current of air ; for charcoal is highly 
prejudicial in a state of ignition, al- 
though it may be rendered even active- 
ly beneficial when boiled, as a small 
quantity of it, if boiled with meat on 
the turn, will effectually cure the un- 
pleasant taint. 

579. THE HOUSEWIFE who is 
anxious to dress no more meat than 
will suffice for the meal, should know 
that beef loses about one pound in four 
in boiling, but in roasting, loses in the 
proportion of one pound five ounces, 
and in baking about two ounces less, or 
one pound three ounces ; mutton loses 
in boiling about fourteen ounces in four 
pounds ; in roasting, one pound six 
ounces. 

580. THE AMERICANS, generally 
speaking, are very deficient in the prac- 
tice of culinary economy ; a French 
family would live well on what is often 
wasted in an American kitchen : the 
bones, drippings, pot-liquor, remains of 
fish, vegetables, &c., which are too 
often consigned to the grease-pot or the 



dust-heap, might, by a very trifling 
degree of management on the part of 
the cook, or mistress of a family, be 
converted into sources of daily support 
and comfort, at least to some poor pern- 
sioncr or other, at an expense that even 
the miser could scarcely grudge. 

581. IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO 
FURNISH A HOUSE, do not spend 
all your money, be it much or .little. 
Do not let the beauty of this thing, and 
the cheapness of that, tempt you to buy 
unnecessary articles. Doctor Frank- 
lin's maxim was a wise one "Nothing 
is cheap that we do not want." Buy 
merely enough to get along with at 
first. It is only by experience that you 
can tell what will be the wants of your 
family. If you spend all your money, 
you will find you have purchased many 
things you do not want, and have no 
means left to get many things which 
you do want. If you have enough, and 
more than enough, to get everything 
suitable to your situation, do not think 
you must spend it all, merely because 
you happen to have it. Begin humbly. 
As riches increase, it is easy and pleas- 
ant to increase in comforts ; but it is 
always painful and inconvenient to de- 
crease. After all, these things are 
viewed in their proper light by the 
truly judicious and respectable. Neat- 
ness, tastefulness, and good sense may 
be shown in the management of a small 
household, and the arrangement of a 
little furniture, as well as upon a larger 
scale; and these qualities are always 
praised, and always treated with re- 
spect and attention. The considera- 
tion which many purchase by living 
beyond their income, and, of course, 
living upon others, is not worth the 
trouble it costs. The glare there is 
about this false and wicked parade is 
deceptive : it does not, in fact, procure 
a man valuable friends, or extensive 
influence. 

582. IF A LARDER BY ITS 
POSITION, will not admit of opposite 
windows, then a current of air must be 
admitted by means of a flue from the 
outside. 



THAT HAVE NEVER HAPPfcXED. 



127 



583. THE BENEFICIAL EF- 
FECTS OF CHARCOAL in stopping 
putrefaction are now well ascertained ; 
fish or me it may be restored by boiling 
charcoal - r ith them. 

584. " MORNING'S MILK," says 
an eminent German philosopher, "com- 
monly yields some hundredth s more 
cream than the evening's at the same 
temperature.' That milked at noon 
furnishes the least ; it would therefore 
be of advantage in making, butter and 
cheese, to employ the morning's milk, 
and to keep the evening's for domestic 
use." 

585. BREAD contains eighty nutri- 
tious parts in 100 ; meal thirty -four in 
100 ; French beans, ninety-two in 100 ; 
common beans, eighty-nine in 100; 
pe-as, ninety-throe in 100 ; lentils, 
ninety-four in 100 ; cabbages and tur- 
nips, the most aqueous of all the vege- 
tables compared, produce only eight 
pounds of solid matter in 100 pounds ; 
carrots and spinach produce fourteen 
in the saine quantity ; while one hun- 
dred pounds of potatoes contain twenty- 
five pounds of dry substance. From a 
general estimate it results, that one 
pound of good bread is equal to two 
pounds and a half or three pounds of 
potatoes ; that seventy-five pounds of 
bread and thirty of meat may be substi- 
tuted for 300 pounds of potatoes. The 
other substances bear the following 
proportions : four parts of cabbage to 
one of potatoes ; three parts of turnips 
to one of potatoes ; two parts of carrots 
and spinach to one of potatoes ; and 
about three parts and a half of potatoes 
to one of rice, lentils, beans, French 
beans, and dry peas. 

586. TO TEST FLOUR, people in 
the trade generally knead a small quan- 
tity by way of experiment ; if good, the 
flour immediately forms an adhesive 
elastic paste, which will readily assume 
any form that may be given to it, with- 
out danger of breaking. Pure and un- 
adulterated flour may like 1 vise be 
easily distinguished by other methods : 
seize a handful briskly, and squeeze it 
half a minute ; it prase res the firm of 



the cavity of the hand in one piece, 
although' it may be rudely placed on 
the table ; not so that which contains 
foreign substances, it breaks in pieces 
more or less ; that mixed with whiting 
being the most adhesive, but still divid- 
ing and falling down in a little time. 

587. A GREAT INCREASE ON 
HOME-MADE BREAD, even equal 
to one fifth, may be produced by using 
bran water for kneading the dougli. 
The proportion is three pounds of bran 
for every twenty-eight pounds of flour, 
to be boiled for an hour, and tnen 
strained through a hair-sieve. 

588. EXCELLENT PASTE for 
fruit o* meat pies may be made with 
two-thirds of wheat-flour, one-third of 
the flour of boiled potatoes, and some 
butter or dripping ; the whole being 
brought to a proper consistence with 
warm water, and a small quantity of 
yeast added when lightness is desired. 
This will also make very pleasant cakes 
for breakfast, and may be made with or 
without spices, fruits, &c. 

589. POTATOES. There are few 
articles in families more subject to 
waste, both in paring, boiling, and being 
actually thrown away, than potatoes ; 
and chere are few cooks but what boil 
twice as many potatoes every day as 
are wanted, and fewer still that do not 
throw the residue away as totally unfit 
in any shape for the next day's m^al ; 
yet if they would take the trouble to 
heat up the despised cold potatoes with 
an equal quantity of flour they would 
find them produce a much lighter 
dumpling or pudding than they can 
make with flour alone ; and by the aid 
of a few spoonfuls of good gravy, they 
will provide a cheap and agreeable ap- 
pendage to the dinner table. (See 12?.) 

590. BOILING. This most simple 
of culinary processes is not often p*i- 
forined in perfection; it does not re- 
quire quite so much nicety and attend- 
ance as roasting ; to skim your pot 
well, and keep it really boiling (the 
slower the better) all the whi'e to

\VE SELDOM REPENT OF HAVING EATIXG TOO LITTLE.

591. RECKON THE TIME for its first 
coming to a boil. The old rule ot 
fifteen minutes to a pound of meat, we 
think rather too little ; the slower it 
boils, the tenderer, the plumper, arid 
whiter it will be. For those who choose 
their food thoroughly cooked (which all 
will who have any regard for their 
stomachs), twenty minutes to a pound 
will not be found too much for gentle 
simmering by the side of the fire ; 
allowing more or less time, according 
to the thickness of the joint, and the 
coldness of the weather ; always remem- 
bering, the slower it boils the better. 
Without some practice it is difficult to 
teach any art; and cooks seem to sup- 
pose they must be right, if they put 
meat into a pot, arid set it over the fire 
for a certain time making no allow- 
ance, whether it simmers without a 
bubble, or boils at a gallop. 

592. FRESH KILLED MEAT will take 
much longer time boiling than that 
which baa been kept till it is what the 
butchers call ripe, and longer in cold 
than in warm weather ; if it be frozen, 
it must be thawed before boiling as 
before roasting ; if it be fresh killed, it 
will be tough and hard, if you stew it 
ever so long, and ever so gently. In 
cold weather, the night before you 
dress it, bring it into a place of which 
the temperature is not less than forty- 
five degrees of Fahrenheit's ther- 
mometer. The size of the boiling pots 
should be adapted to what they are to 
contain ; the larger the saucepan the 
more room it takes upon the fire ; and 
a larger quantity of water requires a 
proportionate increase of fire to boil it. 
In small families, we recommend block 
tin saucepans, &c., as lightest and 
safost ; if proper care is taken of them, 
and they are well dried after they are 
cleansed, they are by far the cheapest; j 
the purchase of a new tin sauce-pun 
being little more than the expense of j 
tinning a copper one. Take care that j 
the covers of your boiling pots fit close ! 
not only to prevent unnecessary j 
evaporation of t'ie water, but that, the 
imoke may /v>f .ushriAte itself unler 



! the edge of the lid, and give the meat 
ia bad taste 

593. IF YOU LET MEAT OR POUL- 
TRY REMAIN IN THE WATER after it 

is done enough, it will become sodden 
and lose its flavour. 

594. BEEF AND MUTTON a little un- 
der-done (especially very large joints, 
which will make the better hash or 
broil) is not a great fault by some peo- 
ple it is preferred ; but lamb, pork, and 
veal, are uneatable if not thoroughly 
boiled but do not overdo them. A tri- 
vet, or fish-drainer, put on the bottom of 
the boiling pot, raising the contents 
about an inch and a half from the bot- 
tom, will prevent that side of the meat 
which comes next the bottom from 
being done too much and the lower 
part of the meat will be as delicately 
done as the other part ; and this will 
enable you to take out the contents of 
the pot without sticking a fork, &c., 
into it. If you have not a trivet, use 
four skewers, or a soup-plate laid the 
wrong side upwards. 

595. TAKE CARE OF THE LIQUOR 
you have boiled poultry or meat in; in 
five minutes you may make it into 
soup. 

596. THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE never 
boils a joint without converting the 
broth into some sort of soup. 

597. IF THE LIQUOR BK TOO S\LT, 
only use half the quantity, and the rest 
water ; wash salted meat well with 
cold water before you put it into the 
boiler. 

598. ROASTING. BEEF. The no- 
ble sirloin of about fifteen pounds (if 
much thicker the outside will be done 
too much before the inside is enough), 
will require to be before the fire about 
three and a half or four hours. Take 
care to spit it evenly, that it may not 
be heavier on one side than the other ; 
put a little clean dripping into the dip- 
ping-pan (tie a sheet of paper over it to 
preserve the fat) ; baste it well as soon 
as it is put down, and every qunrter-of- 
an-hour all the time it is roasting, til] 
the lust half hour; then take off the 
paper and make some gravy for it, stir

the fire and make it clear ; to brown 
and froth it, sprinkle a little salt over 
it, baeto it with butter, and dredge it 
with flour ; let it go a few minutes 
longer, till the froth rises, take it up, 
put it on the dish, &c. Garnish it 
with horse-radish, scraped as fine as 
possible with a very sharp knife. 

599. A YORKSHIRE PUDDING is an 
excellent accompaniment. 

600. RIBS OF BEEF. The three 
first ribs, of fifteen or twenty pounds, 
will take three hours, or three and a- 
half ; the fourth and fifth ribs will take 
as long, managed in the same way as 
the sirloin. Paper the fat and the thin 
part, or it will be done too much, be- 
fore the thick part is done enough. 

601. RIBS OF BlJSF BONED AND 

ROLLED. When you have kept two or 
three ribs of beef till quite tender, take 
out the bones, and skewer it as round 
as possible (like a fillet of veal) ; before 
they roll it, some cooks egg it, and 
sprinkle it with veal stuffing. As the 
meat is more in a solid mass, it will 
require more time at the fire than in 
the preceding receipt ; a piece of ten 
or twelve pounds weight will not be 
well and thoroughly roasted in less than 
four and a half or five hours. For the 
first half hour it should not be less than 
twelve inches from the fire, that it may 
get gradually warm to the centre ; the 
last half hour before it will be finished, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, and if you 
wish to froth it, flour it, &c. 

602. MUTTON. As beef requires a 
large eound fire, mutton must have a 
brisk and sharp one ; if you wish to 
have mutton tender it should be hung 
as long as it will keep, and then good 
eight-tooth, i. e. four years' old mutton 
is as good eating as venison. 

603. THE LEG, HAUNCH, & SADDLE 
Avill be the better for being hung up in 
a cool airy place for four or five days at 
leaf-t ; in temperate weather a week ; 
in cold weather, ten days. A leg of 
eight pounds will take about two hours ; 
let it be well basted. 

604. A CHINE OR SADDLE i.e. the 
two loins, of ten o- eleven Bounds two 



hours and a half. It is the business of 
the butcher to take off the skin and 
skewer it on again, to defend the meat 
from extreme heat, and preserve its 
succulence. If this is neglected, tie a 
sheet of paper over it; baste the strings 
you tie it on with directly, or they will 
burn. About a quarter of an hour be- 
fore you think it will be done, take off 
the skin or paper, that it may get a 
pale brown colour, and then baste it, 
and flour it lightly to froth it. 

605. A SHOULDER, of seven pounds, 
an hour and a half. Put the spit in 
close to the shank-bone, and run it along 
the blade-bone. 

606. A LOIN OF MUTTON, from an 
hour and a half to an hour and three- 
quarters. The most elegant way of 
carving this is to cut it lengthwise, as 
you do a saddle. A neck about the 
same time as a loin. It must be care- 
fully jointed, or it is very difficult to 
carve. 

607. THE NECK AND BREAST are, in 
small families, commonly roasted to- 
gether. The <jook will then crack the 
bones across the middle before they 
are put dov/n to roast. If this is not 
done careJCully they are very trouble- 
some to ci.re. A breast, an hour and 
a quarter. 

608. A HAUNCH i. e. , the leg and 
part of the loin of mutton. Send up 
two sauce-boats with it ; one of rich 
drawn mutton gravy, made without 
spice or herbs, and the other of sweet 
sauce. It generally weighs about fif- 
teen poimds, and requires about three 
hours and a half to roast it. 

609. MUTTON (venison fashion). 
Take a neck of good four or five-year- 
old wether mutton, cut long in the 
bones ; let it hang, in temperate 
weather, at least a week. Two days 
before you dress it, take allspice and 
black pepper, ground and pounded fine, 
a quarte-r of an ounce each, rub them 
together, and then rub your mutton 
well with this mixture twice a day. 
When you dress it, wash off the 
spice with warm water, and roast it io 



NEVER BUY WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP. 



131 



610. VEAL requires particular care 
to roast it a nice brown. Let the fire 
be the same as for beef; a sound 
large fire for a large joint, and a brisker 
for a smaller ; put it at some distance 
from the fire to soak thoroughly, and 
then draw it nearer to finish it brown. 
When first laid down it is to be basted : 
basto it again occasionally. When the 
veal is on the dish pour over it half a 
pint of melted butter; if you have a 
tttie brown gravy by you, add that to 
the butter. With those joints which 
are not stuffed, send up forcemeat in 
balls, or rolled into sausages, as garnish 
to the dish, or fried pork sausages ; 
bacon and greens are always expected 
with veal. 

611. A FILLET OF VEAL, of from 
twelve to sixteen pounds, will require 
from four to five hours at a good fire ; 
make some stuffing or forcemeat, and 
put it under the flap, that there may 
be some left to eat cold, or to season a 
hash ; brown it, and pour good melted 
butter over it. Garnish with thin 
slices of lemon, and cakes or balls of 
stuffing, or duck stuffing, or fried pork 
sausages, curry sauce, bacon and 
greens, &c. 

612. A LOIN is the best part of the 
calf, and will take about three hours 
roasting. Paper the kidney fat, and 
the back ; soirite cooks send it up on a 
toast, which is eaten with the kidney 
and the fat of this part, which is more 
delicate than any marrow, &c. If 
there is more of it than you think will 
be eaten with the veal, before you roast 
it cut it out, it will make an excellent 
suet pudding ; take care to have your 
fire long enough to brown the ends. 
(See 239.) 

613. A SHOULDER. OF VEAL, from 
three hours to three hours and a half; 
stuff it with the forcemeat ordered for 
the fillet of veal in the under side. 

614. NKCK, best end, will take two 
hours. The scrag part is best made 
into a pie or broth. 13 UK AST, from an

take it off, to brown it ; baste, flour, 
and froth it. 

615. VEAL SWEETBREAD. Trim a 
fine sweetbread, it cannot b". too fresh ; 
parboil it for five minutes, and throw it 
into a basin of cold water ; roast it 
plain, or beat up the yolk of an egg, 
and prepare some fine bread crumbs. 
When the sweetbread is cold, dry it 
thoroughly in a cloth, run a lark spit or 
a skewer through it, and tie it on the 
ordinary spit ; egg it with a paste 
brush, powder it well with bread 
crumbs, and roast it. For sauce, fried 
bread crumbs round it, and melted but- 
ter with a little mushroom catsup and 
lemon juice, or serve them on buttered 
toast, garnished with egg sauce, or with 
gravy. 

616. LAMB is a delicate and com- 
monly considered tender meat, but 
those who talk of tender lamb, while 
they are thinking of the age of the ani- 
mal forget that even a chicken must be 
kept a proper time after it has been 
killed, or it will be tough picking. 
Woeful experience has warned us to 
beware of accepting an invitation to 
dinner on Easter Sunday ; and unless 
commanded by a thorough-bred gour- 
mand, our incisors, molars, and princi- 
pal viscera, have protested against the 
imprudence of encountering young 1 
tough, stringy mutton under the mis- 
nomer of grass-lamb. To the usual 
accompaniments of roasted meat, green 
mint sauce or a salad is commonly 
added; and some cooks, about five 
minutes before it is done, sprinkle it 
with a little minced parsley. 

617. GRASS-LAMB is in season from 
June to September. 

618. HOUSE-LAMB from Christmas 
to April. 

619. WHEN GREEN MINT cannot be 
got, mint vinegar is an acceptible sub 
stitbite for it. 

620. HIND-QUARTER of eight pounds 
will take from an hour and three-quar- 
ters to two hours ; baste and froth it.

6-27. PREPARATION OF VEGE- 
TABLES. There is nothing in which 
the difference between an elegant and 
an ordinary table is more seen than in 
the dressing of vegetables, more especi- 
ally of greens : they may be equally as 
fine at first, at one place as at another, 
but their look and taste are afterwards 
very different, entirely from the careless 
way in which they have been cooked. 
They are in greatest perfection when in 
greatest plenty, i.e., when in full sea- 
Kon. By season, we do not mean those 
early clays, that luxury in the buyers, 
and avarice in the sellers about New 
York force the various vegetables : but 
the time of the year in which by nature 
and common culture, and the mere 
operation of the sun and climate, they 
are in most plenty and perfection. 

628. POTATOES and Peas are seldom 
worth eating before Midsummer. 

629. UNRIPE VEGETABLES are as 
insipid and unwholesome as unripe 
fruits. 

630. AS TO THE QUALITY OF VE- 
GETABLES the middle size are preferred 
to the largest or the smallest ; they are 
more tender, juicy, and full of flavour, 
just before they are quite full grown : 
freshness is their chief value and excel- 
lence, and I should as soon think of 
roasting an animal alive, as of boiling a 
vegetal)] 3 after it is dead. The eye 
easily discovers if they have been kept 
too long ; they soon loose their beauty 
in all i aspects. 

631 ROOTS, GREEN SALADS &C., 



and the various productions of the par 
den, when first gathered, are plump and 
firm, and have a fragrant freshness no 
art can give them again ; though it will 
refresh them a little to put them into 
cold spring water for some time before 
they are dressed. 

632. To BOIL THEM in soft water 
will preserve the colour best of such as 
are green; if you have only hard water 
put to it a teaspoonful of carbonate of 
potash. 

633. TAKE CARE TO WASH AND 
CLEANSE THEM thoroughly from dust, 
dirt, and insects ; this requires great 
attention ; pick off all the outside leaves, 
trim thtmi nicely, and if they are not 
quite fresh-gathered and have become 
flaccid, it is absolutely necessary to 
restore their crispness before cooking 
them, or they will be tough and un- 
pleasant ; lay them in a pan of clean 
w r ater, with a handful of salt in it, foi 
an hour before you dress them. Most 
vegetables being more or less succulent, 
their full proportion of fluids is neces- 
sary for their retaining that state of 
crispness and plumpness which they 
have when growing. 

634. ON BEING CUT OR GATHERED, 

the exhalation from their surface con- 
tinues, while from the open vessels of 
the cut surface there is often great 
exudation or evaporation, and thus 
their natural moisture* is diminished; 
the tender leaves become flaccid, and 
the thicker masses or roots lose their 
plumpness. This is not only less plea- 
sant to the eye, but is a real injury to 
the nutritious powers of the vegetable ; 
for in this flaccid and shrivelled state 
its fibres are less easily divided in chew- 
ing, and the water which exists in 
vegetable substances, in the form of 
their respective natural juices, is di- 
rectly nutritious. 

635. THE FIRST CARE IN THE 
PRESERVATION OF SUCCULENT VE- 
GETABLES, therefore, it is to prevent 
them from losing their natural mois- 
ture. They should always be boiled in 
a saucepan" by themselves, and have 
plenty erf water : if meat is boiled with 



NEVER TROUBLE ANOTHER FOR WHAT YOU CAN DO YOURSU.F. 



133 



them ir, the same pot, they will spoil 
the look and taste of each other. 

636. TO HAVE VEGETABLES DELI- 
CATELY CLEAN, put mi your pot, make 
it boil, put a little salt in and skim it 
perfectly clean before you put in the 
greens, &c., which should not be put in 
till the water boils briskly; the quicker 
they boil the greener they will be. 

637. WHEN THE VEGETABLES SINK, 
they are generally done enough, if the 
water has been kept constantly boiling. 
Take them up immediately, or they 
will lose their colour and goodness. 
Drain the water from them thoroughly 
before you send them to table. This 
branch of cookery requires the most 
yigilaut attention. 

638. IF VEGETABLES are a minute or 
two too long over the fire, they lose all 
their beauty and flavour. 

639. IF NOT thoroughly boiled ten- 
der, they are tremendously indigestible, 
and much more troublesome during 
their residence in the stomach than un- 
der-done meats. 

640. To PRESERVE or give colour in 
cookery many good dishes are spoiled ; 
but the rational epicure who makes 
nourishment the main end of eating, 
will be content to sacrifice the shadow 
to enjoy the substance. Once for all, 
take care your vegetables are fresh; for 
as the fishmonger often suffers for the 
sins of the cook, so the cook often gets 
undeservedly blamed instead of the 
green-grocer. 

641. PRESERVING FRUIT. 
The grand secret of preserving is to 
deprive the fruit of its water of vegeta- 
tion in the shortest time possible ; for 
which purpose the fruit ought to be 
gathered just at the point of proper 
maturity. An ingenious French writer 
considers fruit of all kinds as having 
four distinct periods of maturity the 
maturity of vegetation, the honeyfica- 
tion, of expectation, and of coction 

642. THE first of these he considers 
as the period when, having gone through 
the vegetable processes up to the ripen- 
ing, it appears ready to drop spontane- 
ously. This however ; s a period which 



arrives sooner in the warm climate 01 
France than in the colder orchards of 
America ; but its absolute presence may 
be ascertained by the general tilling out 
of the rind, by the bloom, by the smell, 
and by the tacility with which it may 
be plucked from the branch. But even 
in France, as generally practised in 
America, this period may be hastened, 
either by cutting circularly through the 
outer rind at the foot of the branch, so 
as to prevent the return of the sap, or 
by bending the branch tc a horizontal 
position on an espalier, which answers 
the same purpose. 

643. THE second period, or that of 
honeyfication, consists in the ripeness 
and flavour which fruits of all kinds 
acquire if plucked a few days before 
arriving at their first maturity, and 
preserved under a proper degree of 
temperature. Apples may acquire or 
arrive at this second degree of maturity 
upon the tree, but it too often happens 
that the flavour of the fruit is thus lost, 
for fruit over ripe is always found to 
have parted with a portion of its fla- 
vour. 

644. THE third stage, or of expecta- 
tion, as the theorist quaintly terms it, 
is that which is acquired by pulpy 
fruits, which, though sufficiently ripe to 
drop off the tree are even then hard and 
sour. This is the case with several 
kinds both of apples and pears, not to 
mention other fruits, which always im- 
prove after keeping in the confection- 
ery, but with respect to the medlar 
and the quince this maturity of expec- 
tation is absolutely necessary. 

645. THE FOURTH DEGREE of ma- 
turity, or of coction, is completely arti- 
ficial, and is nothing more nor less than 
change produced upon fruit by the aid 
of culinary heat. 

646. WE have already pointed out 
the first object necessary in the preser- 
vation of fruit, its maturity or vegeta- 
tion ; and we may apply the same prin 
ciple to flowers or leaves which may bo 
gathered for use. 

647 THE FLOWERS ought to be 
gathered a day or two before Uw

XEYER PUT OFF TILL TO-MORIIOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TO-DAT. 



petals are ready to drop off spontane- 
ously on the setting of the fruit ; and 
the leaves must be plucked before the 
season has begun to rob them of their 
vegetable juices. The degree of heat 
necessary for the purpose of drying 
must next be considered, as .t differs 
considerably with respect to different 



substances. 
648. FLOWERS 



OB AROMATIC 



PLANTS require the smallest increase 
of heat beyond the temperature of the 
season, provided that season be genial ; 
something more for rinds or roots, and 
a greater heat for fruits ; but this heat 
must not be carried to excess. 

649. PHILOSOPHIC CONFECTIONERS 
may avail themselves of the thermome- 
ter : but practice forms the best guide 



exercise both the fancy and the judg- 
ment in its preparation. Nor is it par- 
ticularly necessary to notice the salu- 
brious effects resulting from the bath, 
beyond the two points of its being BO 
conducive both to health and cleanli- 
ness, in keeping up a free circulation ol 
the blood, without any violent muscu- 
lar exertion, thereby really affording a 
saving of strength, and producing its 
effects without any expense either to 
the body or to the purse. 

651. WHOEVER FITS UP A BATH 
in a house already built must be guided 
by circumstances: but it will always 
be proper to place it as near the kitchen 
fire-place as possible, because from 
thence it may be heated, or at least 
have its temperature preserved by 



in tlu's case, and therefore we shall | means of hot air through tubes, or by 



say, without speaking of degrees of 
Fahrenheit or Keaumur, that if the ne- 
cessary heat for flowers is one and a 
quarter, that for fruits one and three 
quarters, or nearly double of what one 
may be above the freezing point. 

650. BATHING. If to preserve 
health be to save medical expenses, 
without even reckoning upon time and 
comfort, there is no part of the house- 
bold arrangement so important to the 
domestic economist as cheap conveni- 
ence for personal ablution. For this 
purpose baths upon a large and expen- 
sive scale are by no means necessary ; 
but though temporary or tin baths may 
be extremely useful upon pressing- occa- 
sions, it will be found to be finally as 
cheap, and much more readily conve- 
nient, to have a permanent bath con- 
structed, which may be done in any 
dwelling-house of moderate size, with- 
out interfering with other general pur- 
poses. As the object of these remarks 
is not to present essays, but merely 
useful economic hints, it is unnecessary 
to expatiate upon the architectural ar- 
rangement of the bath, or, more proper- 
ly speaking, the bathing-place, which 
may be fitted up for the most retired 
establishment, differing ir size or shape 
agreeable to the spare room that may t 
be appropriated to t and serving to | practice! (See 3668.) 



steam prepared by the culinary fire- 
place, without interfering with its or- 
dinary uses. 

65'2. A SMALL BOILER may be erect- 
ed at a very small expense, in the bath- 
room, where circumstances do not per- 
mit these arrangements. Whenever a 
bath is' wan ted at a short warning, to 
boil the water necessary will always be 
the shortest mode ; but where it is in 
general daily use, the heating the water 
by steam will be found the cheapest 
and most convenient method. 

653. AS A GUIDE FOR PRACTICE, 

we may observe it has been proved by 
experiment that a bath with five feet 
water at the freezing point, may be 
raised to the temperature of blood 
heat, or 96 degrees, by 304 gallons of 
water turned into steam, at an expense 
of 501bs. of Newcastle coal : but if the 
door be kept closed, it will not lose 
above four degrees of temperature in 
twenty-four hours, by a daily supply of 
31bs. of coal. This is upon a scale of a 
bath of 5,000 gallons of water. 

654. WASHING. The most im- 
portant department of domestic eco- 
nomy naturally includes the wash- 
bouse, into which philosophy has found 
its way for the application of many 
useful principles, and much useful 



PLEASURE IS PRECARIOUS, BUT VIRTUE IS IMMORTAL.

r>r>5. WHEN WATER is HARD, and 
wiil not readily unite with soap, it will 
always be proper to boil it before use; 
which will be found sufficiently effica- 
cious, if the hardness depends solely 
upon the impregnation of lime, is the 
form of what mi dern chemistry desig- 
nates as a eubcarbonate. The philoso- 
phical reason for this is, that the lime, 
by some secret process of nature, is 
united to a portion of carbonic acid, 
which causes it to be suspended in the 
water: but, in the process of boiling, 
the carbonic acid unites with the ac- 
quired caloric, and is carried off with 
it into the atmosphere. Even exposure 
to the atmosphere will produce this 
effect in a great degree upon spring 
water so impregnated, leaving it much 
fitter for lavatory purposes. In both 
cases the water ought to be carefully 
poured off from the sediment, as the 
neutralized lime, when freed from its 
extra quantity of carbonic acid, falls to 
the bottom by its own gravity. Boil- 
ing, however, has no effect, when the 
hardness of the water proceeds from 
lime united with the sulphuric acid, or 
sulphate of lime of the modern chem- 
istry ; and it must be neutralized, or 
brought to its proper state, by the ap- 
plication of common wood ashes from 
the kitchen grate, or of barilla, now- 
called soda, or the Dantzic ashes, or 
pearl-ash : or by the more scientific 
process of dropping in a, solution of 
subcarbonate of potash. Each of these 
unite with the sulphuric acid, and se- 
parate it from the lime, which gravi- 
tates, as in the former case, to the 
bottom. Having thus philosophically 
explained the arcana of the washing- 
tub, we may offer a saving hint in order 
to economise the use of soap, which is, 
to put any quantity of pearl-ash into a 
large jar, covered from the dust; in 
a few days the alkali will become 
liquid, which must be diluted in double 
its quantity of ^oft water with its equal 
quantity of new-slacked lime. Boil it 
half-an-hour, frequently stirring it ; 
adding as much s tore hot water and 
drawing off the liquor, whei the 



residuum may be boiled afresh, and 
drained, until it ceases to feel acrid to 
the tongue. 

656. SOAP AND LABOUR MAY BE 

SAVED by dissolving alum and chalk 
in bran-water, in which the linen ought 
to be boiled, then well rinsed out, 
and exposed to the usual process of 
bleaching. 

657. SOAP MAY BE DISUSED, OT 

nearly so, in the getting up of muslins 
and chintzes, which should always be 
treated agreeably to the oriental man- 
ner ; that ^is, to wash them in plain 
water, and'then boil them in congee or 
rice-water : after which they ought not 
to be submitted to the operation of the 
smoothing iron, but rubbed smooth with 
a polished stone. 

658. THE ECONOMY which must re- 
sult from these processes renders their 
consideration important to every private 
family, in addition to which we must 
state that the improvements in philoso- 
phy extend to the laundry as well as to 
the wash-house. 

659. EXERCISE. Three principal 
points in the manner of taking exercise 
are necessary to be attended to: 1. 
The kind of exercise. 2. The proper 
time for exercise. 3. The duration of 
it. With respect to the kinds of exer- 
cise, the various species of it may be 
divided into active and passive. Among 
the first, which admit of being consi- 
derably diversified, may be enumerated 
walking, running, leaping, swimming, 
riding, fencing, the military exercise, 
different sorts of athletic games, &c. 
Among the latter, or passive kinds of 
exercise, may be comprised riding in a 
carriage, sailing, friction, swinging, &c. 

660. THE FIRST, or active exercises 
are more beneficial to youth, to the 
middle-aged, to the robust in general, 
and particularly to the corpulent and 
the plethoric. 

661. THE SECOND, or passive kinrta 
of exercise, on tr e contrary, are better 
calculated for children ; old, dry, and 
emaciated persons of a delicate and de- 
bilitated constitution ; and particularly 
to the asthmatic and consumptive. 



136 



PUNCTUALITY BEGETS CONFIDENCE 



662. THE TIME at which exercise is 
most proper, depends on such a variety 
of concurrent circumstances, that it 
does not admit of being 1 regulated by 
any general rules, and must therefore 
be collected from the observations made 
on the effects of air, food, drink, &c. 

063. WITH respect to the DURATION 
of exercise, there are other particulars, 
relative to a greater or less degree of 
fatigi.3 attending the different specie* 
aud utility of it in certain states of tho 
mind and body, which must determine 
this consideration as well as the pre- 
ceding. 

664. THAT exercise is to be pre- 
ferred which, with a view to brace and 
strengthen the body, we are most ac- 
customed to, as any unusual one may 
be attended w y ith a contrary effect. 

665. EXERCISE should be begun 
finished gradually, never abruptly. 

666. EXERCISE in the open air has 
many advantages over that used within 
doors. 

667. To continue exercise until a 
profuse perspiration or a great degree 
of weariness takes place, is far from 
being wholesome. 

668. IN the forenoon, when the 
stomach is not too much distended, 
muscular motion is both agreeable and 
healthful ; it strengthens digestion, and 
heats the body less than with a full 
stomach ; and a good appetite after it 
is a proof that it has not been carried 
to excess. 

669. BUT, at the same time, it should 
be understood, that it is riot advisable 
to take violent exercise immediately 
before a meal, as digestion might there- 
by be retarded. 

670. NEITHER should we sit down 
to a substantial dinner or supper im- 
mediately on returning from a fatiguing 
walk, at a time when the blood is 
heated, and the body in a state of per- 
upiration from previous exertion, as 
the worst consequences may arise, 
especially where cooling dishes, salad, 
or a glass of cold drink is begun with. 

671. EXKRCISB is always hurtful 
after nealr from ;t. impeding diges- 



and ones. 



tion, by propelling those fluids too 
much towards the surface of the Uody 
which are designed for the solution of 
the food in the stomach. 

ti~2. CARPETS. In buying a car- 
pet, as in everything else, those of the 
best quality are cheapest in the end. 
As it is extremely desirable that they 
should look as clean as possible, avoid 
buying carpet that has any white in it. 
Even a very small portion <;t white in- 
terspersed through the pattern will in 
a short time give a dirty appearance to 
the whole ; arid certainly no carpet 
can be worse for use than one with a 
white ground. 

673. A CARPET in which all the 
colours are light, never has a clean, 
bright effect, from the want of dark 
tints to contrast arid set off the light 



674. Foil a similar reason, carpets 
whose colours are all of what artists 
call middle tint (neither dark nor 
light), cannot fail to look dull and 
dingy, even when quite new. 

675. THE caprices of fashion at 
times bring these ill-coloured carpets 
into vogue ; but in apartments where 
elegance is desirable, they always have 
a bad effect. 

676. Fou a carpet to be really beau- 
tiful and in good taste, there should be, 
as in a picture, a judicious disposal of 
light and shadow, with a gradation of 
very bright and of very dark tints ; 
some almost white, and others almost 
or quite black. 

677. THE most truly chaste, rich, 
and elegant carpets are those where the 
pattern is formed by one colour only, 
but arranged in every variety of shade. 
For instance, we have seen a Brussels 
carpet entirely red ; the pattern formed 
by shades or tints, varying from the 
deepest crimson (almost a black), to 
the palest pink (almost a white). Also 
one of green only, shaded from the 
dark tot bottle-green, in some parts of 
the figure, to the lightest pea-green io 
others. Another, in which there was 
no colour but brown, in all its various 
gradations, some of the shade* 



MONET IS A GOOD SERVANT, BUT A BAD MASTER. 



137 



nearly black, others of a light buff. 
All those carpets had much the look 
of ru-.h cut velvet. 

678. Ttiu Curtains, Sofas, &c., of 
course, were of corresponding colours, 
and the effect of tlie whole was noble 
and elegant. 

679. CARPETS of many gaudy colours 
are much less in demand than formerly. 
Two colours only, with the dark and 
light shade of each, will make a very 
handsome carpet. 

680. A VKRY light blue ground, with 
the figure of shaded crimson or purple, 
looks extremely well ; so does a 
salmon-colour or buff ground, with a 
deep green figure ; or a light yellow 
ground, with a shaded blue figure. 

681. IF you cannot obtain a Hearth- 
rug that exactly corresponds with the 
carpet, get one entirely different ; for 
a decided contrast looks better than a 
bad match. 

682. WE have seen very handsome 
hearthrugs with a rich, black, velvet- 
looking ground, and the figure of 
shaded blue, or of various tints of yel- 
low and orange. 

683. No CARPET decidedly light- 
coloured throughout, has a good effect 
on the floor, or continues long to look 
clean. 

684. CLEANSING OP FURNI- 
TURE. The cleaning, of furniture 
forms an important part of domestic 
economy, not only in regard to neat- 
ness, but also in point of expense. 

685. THE readiest mode indeed con- 
sists iu good manual rubbing, or the es- 
sence of elbows, as it is whimsically 
termed ; but our finest cabinet work 
requires something more, where bril- 
liancy of polish is of importance. 

686. TUB IT ALI AN ^ cabinet work in 
this respect excels that jf any other 
Country. To produce th s effect, the 
workmen first saturate the surface 
with olive oil, and then apply a solution 
of gum arabic in boiling alcohol. This 
mode of varnishing is equally brilliant, 
If not superior, to that employed by 
the French in their most elaborate 
works 



687. Bur another mode may be sub- 
stituted, which has less the appearance 
of a hard varnish, and may always be 

pplied so as to restore the pristine 
beauty of the furniture by a little 
manual labour. Heat a gallon of wa- 
ter, in which dissolve one pound and 
a-half of potash ; add a pound of virgin 
wax, boiling the whole for half-an-hour, 
then suffering it to cool, when the wax 
will float on the surface. Put the wax 
into a mortar, and triturate it with a 
marble pestle, adding soft water to it 
until it forms a soft paste, which laid 
neatly on furniture, or even n paint- 

ngs, and carefully rubbed w en dry, 
with a woollen rag, gives a polish of 
great brilliancy without the harshness 
of the drier varnishes. 

688. MARBLE chimney-pieces may 
also be rubbed with it, after cleaning 
with diluted muriatic acid, or warm 
soap and vinegar ; but the iron or brass 
work connected with them requires 
other processes. 

689. POLLSUED iron work may be 
preserved from rust by a mixture not 
very expensive, consisting of copal var- 
nish intimately mixed with as much 
olive-oil as will give it u degree of 
greasiuess, adding thereto nearly as 
much spirit of turpentine as of varnish. 

690. CAST IRON VVOKK is best pre- 
served by the common method of rub- 
bing with black lead. 

691. IF RUST has made its appear- 
ance on grates or fire-irons, apply a 
mixture of tripoli, with half its qHanti- 
ty of sulphur, intimately mingled on a 
marble slab, and laid on with a piece ot 
soft leather. Or emery and oil may be 
applied with an excellent effect: not 
laid on in the usual slovenly way, but 
with a spongy piece of fig-tree fully sa- 
turated with the mixture. This will 
not only clean but polish, and render 
the use of whiting unnecessary. 

69-2. BRASS ORNAMENTS, when not 
gilt or lackered, may be cleaned the 
same way, and a fine colour given to 
them by two simple processes. 

693. The FIRST is to beat sal ammo- 
niac into a fine powder, then to moisten 



138 



NEVER OPEN THE DOOR TO A LITTLE VICE, 



it with soft water, rubbing it on the or- 
naments, which must be heated over 
charcoal, and rubbed dry with bran and 
whiting. 

694. The SECOND is to wasli the 
brass work with roach alum boiled in 
strong ley, in proportion of an ounce to 
a pint ; when dry, it must be rubbed 
with line tripoli. Either of these pro- 
cesses will give to brass the brilliancy 
of gold. 

695. PRECAUTIONS IN CASE 
OF FIRE. The following precau- 
tions should be impressed upon the me- 
mories of all our readers : 

696. SHOULD a fire break out, send 
off to the nearest engine or police-sta- 
tion. 

697. FILL BUCKETS with water, 
carry them as near the fire as possible, 
dip a mop into the water, and throw it 
in showers on the fire, until assistance 
arrives. 

698 IF A FIRE is violent, wet a 
blanket, and throw it on the part which 
is in flames. 

699. SHOULD A FIRE break out in 
the kitchen-chimney, or any other, a 
blanket wetted should be nailed to the 
upper ends of the mantle-piece, so as 
to cover the opening entirely, the fire 
will then go out of itself; for this pur- 
pose two knobs should be permanently 
fixed in the upper ends of the mantel- 
piece on which the blanket may be 
bJtched. 

700. SHOULD the bed or window- 
curtains be on fire, lay hold of any 
woollen-garment, and beat it on the 
flames until extinguished. 

701. Avoid leaving DOOR OR WIN- 
DOW OPEN in the room where the fire 
has broken out, as the current of air in- 
creases the force of the fire. 

702. Should the STAIKCASE BE BURN- 
ING so as to cut off all communications, 
endeavour to escape by means of a trap- 
door in the roof, a ladder leading to 
which should always be at hand. 

703. AVOID HURRY AND CONFU- 
SION ; no person except a fire police- 
man, friend, or neighbour, should be 
admit ted 



704. IF a lady's dn-ss takes fire she 
should endeavour t6 roll Lemlf in a rug 
carpet, or the first woollen garment she 
meets. 

705. IT IS A GOOD PRECAUTION to 

have always at hand a large piece of 
baize, to throw over a female whose 
dress is burning, or to be wetted and 
thrown over a fire that has -recently 
broken out. 

706. A SOLUTION OF FEARLASII in 

water, thrown upon a fire, extinguishes 
it instantly. The proportion is a quar- 
ter of a pound dissolved in hot water, 
and then poured into a bucket of com- 
mon water. 

707. IT is RECOMMENDED to house- 
holders to have two or three fire-buck- 
ets, and a carriage-mop with a long 
handle near at hand ; they will be found 
essentially useful in case of fire. 

708. ALL HOUSEHOLDERS, but parti- 
cularly hotel, tavern, and innkeepers, 
should exercise a wise precaution by 
directing that the last person up should 
perambulate the premises previous to 
going to rest, to ascertain that all fires 
are safe and lights extinguished. 

709. A WINTER SALAD. 
Two large potatoes, passed through 

kitchen sieve, 

Unwonted softness to the salad give, 
Of mordent mustard add a single 

spoon 
Distrust the condiment which bites so 

soon; 
But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a 

fault, 

To add a double quantity of salt : 
Three times the epoon with oil ol 

Lucca crown, 
And once with vinegar procured from 

town. 
True flavour needs it, and your poet 

begs, 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled 

eggs, 

Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the 

whole : 
And lastly on the favoured compound 

tosa 



LEST A GREAT ONE SHOULD ENTER ALSO.

A. magic teaspoon of anchovy sauce :

vemgon's tough, 
And hain and turkey are not boiled

Serenely full, the epicure may Bay 
" Fate cannot ha ;m me I have dined 

to-day." 

710. ECONOMY. If you have a 
strip of land, do not throw away soap- 
suds. Both ashes and soap-suds are 
good manure for bushes and young 
plants. 

.711. WOOLLEN CLOTHES should be 
washed in very hot suds, and not rinsed. 
Lukewarm water shrinks them. 

712. Do NOT let coifee and tea stand 
in tin. 

713. SCALD your wooden-ware often, 
and keep your tin-ware dry. 

714. PRESERVE the backs of old let- 
ters to write upon. 

715. IP YOU HAVE CHILDREN who 

are learning to write, buy coarse white 
paper by the quantity, and keep it 
locked up, ready to be made into 
writing-books. It does not cost half so 
much as it does to buy them at the 
stationers. 

716. SEE THAT NOTHING is THROWN 
AWAY which might have served to 
nourish your own family or a poorer 
one. 

717. As FAR AS POSSIBLE, have bits 
of bread eaten up before they become 
hard ; spread those that are not eaten, 
and let them dry, to be pounded for 
puddings, or soaked for brewis. 

718. BKEWIS is made of crusts and 
dry pieces of bread, soaked a good 
while in hot milk, mashed up, and eaten 
with salt. Above all do not let crusts 
accumulate in such quantities that they 
cannot be used. With proper care, 
tl er is no need of losing a particle of 
bread. 

719. ALL THE MENDING in the house 
should be done once a week if pos- 
sible. 

720. NEVER PUT OUT SEWING. If it 
be not possible to do it in your own fa- 
mily, hire some one into the house, and 
work with them. 



721 . A WARMING-PAN full of coals, 
or a shovel of coals, held over varnish- 
ed furniture, will take out white spots. 
Care should be taken not to hold tho 
clothes near enough to scorch ; and the 
place should be rubbed with a flannel 
while warm. 

722. SAL-VOLATILE or hartshorn will 
restore colours taken out by acid. Jt 
may be dropped upon any garment 
without doing harm. 

723. NEW IRON should be very gra- 
dually heated at first. After it has be- 
come inured to the heat, it is not so 
likely to crack. 

724. CLEAN A BRASS KETTLE, before 
using it for cooking 1 , with salt and 
vinegar. The oftener carpets are 
shaken, the longer they wear ; the dir* 
that collects under them grinds out the 
threads. 

725. LINEN RAGS should be carefully 
saved, for they are extremely useful in 
sickness. If they have become dirty 
and worn by cleaning silver, &c., wash 
them and scrape them into lint. 

726. IF YOU ARE TROUBLED TO GET 
SOFT WATER FOR WASHING, fill a tub Or 

barrel half full of wood ashes, and fill 
it up with water, BO that you may have 
ley whenever you want it. A gallon of 
strong ley put into a great kettle of 
hard water, will make it as soft as rain 
water. Some people use pearlash, or 
potash ; but this costs something, and 
is very apt to injure the texture of the 
cloth. 

727. Do NOT LET KNIVES be dropped 
Into hot dish-water. It is a good plan 
to have a large tin pot to wash them in, 
just high enough to wash the blades 
without icetting the handles. 

728. IT is better to accomplish per- 
fectly a very small amount of work, 
;han to half do ten times as much. 

729. CHARCOAL powder will be 
bund a' very good thing to give kuivea 
a first-rate polish. 

730. A BONNET and trimmings may 
worn a much longer time, if the 

lust be brushed well off after walking. 

731. MUCH knowledge may be ob 
;ained by the good housewife observing 



140 



DO A LITTLE WELL AND YOU DO MUCH. 



how things are managed iu well-regu- 
lated families. 

732. APPLES intruded for dumplings 
(should not have the core taken out of 
them, as the pips impart a delicious 
flavour to the dumpling'. 

733. A RICE pudding IB most ex- 
cellent without either eggs or sugar, if 
baked gently; it keeps bet^r without 
eggs. 

734. "WILFUL waste makes woful 
want." Do not cook a fresh joint 
whilst any of the last remains uneaten 
hash it up, and with gravy and a 
little management eke out another 
day's dinner. 

735. THE shanks of mutton make 
a good stock for nearly any kind of 
gravy and they are very cheap a 
dozen may be had for a penny, enough 
to make a quart of delicious soup. 

736. THICK curtains, closely drawn 
around the bed, are very injurious, be- 
cause they not only confine the effluvia 
thrown off from our bodies whilst in 
bed, but interrupt the current of pure 
air. 

737. REGULARITY in the payment of 
accounts is essential to housekeeping. 
All tradesmen's bills should be paid 
weekly, for then any errors can be de- 
tected whilst the transactions are fresh 
in the memory. 

738. ALLOWING children to talk 
incessantly is a mistaken intelligence ; 
we do not mean to say that they should 
be restricted from talking in proper 
seasons, but they should be learnt to 
know when it would be proper for them 
to cease. 

739. RULES OF THE GAME 
OF DRAUGHTS. The nine laws for 
regulating the game of draughts are as 
follows : 

740. Each player takes the first 
move alternately, whether the last game 
be won or drawn. 

741. Any action which prevents the 
ndverniry from having a full view of 
the men is not allowed. 

74'2. The player who touches a man 
must play him. 
74 5. In case of standing the huff, 



which means emitting to 1:;.ke a man 
when an opportunity fivr so doing oc 
curred, the other party nwy either take 
the man, or insist upon Lit? i<;;n:, which 
has been so omitted by hie adversary, 
being taken. 

744. If either party, when it is his 
turn to move, hesitate above three 
minutes, the other may call upon him 
to play ; and if, after that, he delay 
above five minutes longer, then he 
loses the game. 

745. In the losing game, the player 
can insist upon his adversary taking all 
the men, in case opportunities should 
present themselves for their being so 
taken. 

740. To prevent unnecessary delay, 
if one colour have no pieces, but two 
kings on the board, and the other no 
piece but one king, the latter can call 
upon the former to win the game in 
twenty moves; if he does not finish it 
within that number of moves, the game 
to be relinquished as drawn. 

747. If there are three kings to two 
on the board, the subsequent moves are 
not to exceed forty. 

748. SEA PIE. Make a thick 
pudding crust, line a di>h with it, or 
what is better, a cake tin, put a layer 
of sliced onions, then a layer of salt beef 
cut in slices, a layer of sliced potatoes, 
a layer of pork, and another of onions, 
strew pepper over all, cover with a 
crust, and tie down tightly with a cloth 
previously dipped in boiling water and 
floured. Boil for two hours, and serve 
hot in a dish.

765. CAMP COOKERY. 

766. STEWED SALT BEEF AND PORK 
(A LA OMAR PASHA). Put into a can- 
teen saucepan about two pounds of well 
soaked beef, cut in eight pieces ; half- 
a-pound of salt pork, divided in two, 
and also soaked; half pound of rice, or 
six tablespoonsful ; quarter of a pound 
of onions, or four middle-sized ones, 
peeled and sliced ; two ounces of brown 
sugar, or one large table-spoonful ; a 
quarter of an ounce of pepper, and five 
pints of water ; simmer gently for 
three hours, remove the fat from the 
top and serve. 

7(57. MUTTON SOUP. Put the rations 
of six into a pan (half a pound of mut- 
ton will make a pint of good family 
soup), six pounds of mutton, cut in four 
or six pieces ; three quarters of a pound 
of mixed vegetables, or, three ounces of 
preserved, as compressed vegetables 
are daily given to the troops ; three 
tea-spoonsful and a half of salt ; one 
teaspooDful of sugar, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, if handy; six 
ounces of barley or rice, or five table- 
spoonsful of either ; eight pints of 
water; let it simmer gently for three 
hours and a half, remove the fat, and 
serve. Bread and biscuit m;iv be 
added in small quantities. 

768. PLAIN PEA Sour. Put in a pau 
6 pounds of pork, well soaked and cut 
into eight pieces ; pour six quarts of 
water over ; one pound of split peas ; 
one tea-spoonful of sugar ; half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper; four ounces of 



142 



BUSTLE IS NOT INDUSTRY 



fresh vegetables, or two ounces of pre- 
served, it' handy ; let it boil gently for 
two hours, or until the peas are tender, 
When the pork is ruther fat, as is 
generally the case, wash it only ; a 
quarter of a pound of broken biscuit 
may be used for the soup. Salt beet, 
when rather fat and soaked, may be 
used for pea soup. 

769. FRENCH BEEP SOUP, or POT AU 
FEU (CAMP FASHION). Put in the 
kettle six pounds of beef, cut into two 
or three pieces, bone included ; one 
pound of mixed green vegetables, or 
half a pound of preserved, in cakes ; 
four teaepoonsful of salt ; if handy, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, one of sugar, and 
three cloves ; and eight pints of water. 
Let it boil gently three hours ; remove 
some of the fat, and serve. The ad- 
dition of a pound and a half of bread, 
cut into slices, or one pound of broken 
biscuits, well soaked, will make a very 
nutritious soup. Skimming 1 is not re- 
quired. 

(The three above receipts are ap- 
plicable to hospitals.) 

770. How TO STEW FRESH BEEF, 
PORK, MUTTON, AND YEAL. Cut or 
chop two pounds of fresh beef into ten 
or twelve pieces ; put these into a 
saucepan with one and a half teaspoons- 
fill of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, 
half a teaspoonful of pepper, two 
middle-sized onions sliced, half a pint 
of water. Set on the fire for ten mi- 
nutes until forfning a thick gravy. 
Add a good tablespoonful of flour, stir 
on the fire a few minutes ; add a quart 
and a hdf of water ; let the whole 
simmer until the meat is tender. Beef 
will take from two hours and a half to 
three hours ; mutton and pork, about 
two hours ; veal, one hour and a quar- 

er to one hour and a half; onions, 
ugar, and pepper, if not to be had, 
must be omitted ; it will even then 
make a good dish; half a pound of 
sliced potatoes, or two ounces of pre- 
served potatoes ; ration vegetables may 
be added, also a small dumpling. 

771. PLAIN BOILED BEEF. For six 
rations, put in a canteen saucepan six 



pounds of well-soaked beef, cut in two 
with three quarts of cold water ; siai 
mer gently three hours, and serve 
About a pound of either carrots, turnips 
parsnips, greens or cabbages, or dump 
lings may be boiled with it. 

772. COSSACK'S PLUMPUDDING. Put 
into a basin one pound of flour, three- 
quarters of a pound of raisins (stoned, 
if time be allowed), three-quarters of a 
pound of the fat of salt pork (well 
washed, cut into small dies, or chopped), 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar or treacle, 
and half a pint of water ; mix all to- 
gether ; put into a cloth tied tightly ; 
boil for four hours, and serve. If time 
will not admit, boil only two hours, 
though four are preferable. How to 
spoil the above : Add anything to it ! 

773. EARLY RISING. The dif- 
ference between rising every morning 
at six and at eight, in the course ot 
forty years, amounts to 29,200 hours 
or three years one hundred and twenty 
one days and sixteen hours, which are 
equal to eight hours a day for exactly 
ten years. So that rising at six will be 
the same as if ten years of life (a 
weighty consideration) were added, 
wherein we may command eight hours 
every day for the cultivation of our 
minds and the despatch of business. 

774. COMPOSITION. If you 
would write to any purpose, you must 
be perfectly free from without, is the 
first place, and yet more free from 
within. Give yourself the natural 
rein ; think on no pattern, no patron, 
no paper, no press, no public ; think on 
nothing, but follow your own impulses. 
Give yourself as you are, what you are, 
and how you see it. Every man sees 
with his own eyes, or does not see at 
all. This is incontrovertibly true. 
Bring out what you have. If you have 
nothing, be an honest beggar rather 
than a respectable thief. Great care 
and attention should be devoted to 
epistolary correspondence, as nothing 
exhibits want of taste and judgment 
so much as a slovenly letter. Since 
the establishment of the cheap postage 

i it is recognised as a rule that all letter? 



NOR IS IMPUDENCE COURAGE. 



148 



should be prepaid ; indeed, many per- 
sons make it a point of never taking in 
an unpaid letter. The following hints 
may be worthy of attention : 

775. ALWAYS put a stamp on your 
envelope at the top of the right hand 
corner. 

776. LET the direction be written 
very plain ; this will save the postman 
trouble, and facilitate business by pre- 
venting mistakes. 

777. AT the head of your letter, in 
the right-hand corner, put your address 
in full, with the day of the month 
underneath ; do not omit this, though 
you may be writing to your most inti- 
mate friend three or four times a day. 

778. WHAT you have to say in your 
letter, say as plainly as possible, as if 
you were speaking ; this is the best 
rule ; do not revert three or four times 
to one circumstance, but finish up as 
you go on. 

779. LET your Big-nature be written 
as plainly as possible (many mistakes 
will be avoided, especially in writing 
to stranger*) and without any flourishes, 
as they tend not to add in any way to 
the harmony of your letter. We have 
seen signatures that have been almost 
impossible to decipher, being a inere 
mass of strokes, without any form to 
indicate letters. This is done chiefly 
by the ignorant, and would lead one to 
suppose that they were ashamed of 
signing what they had written. 

780. Do not cross your letters ; 
surely paper is cheap enough now to 
admit of your using an extra half-sheet, 
in case of necessity. (This practice is 
chiefly prevalent amongst young ladies). 

781. IF you w T rite to a stranger for 
information, or on your own business, 
fail not to send a stamped envelope 
with your address, plainly written ; 
this will not fail to procure you an 
answer. 

782. IF you are not a good writer it 
is advisable to use best ink, the b a st 
paper, and the best pens, as, though 
they may not alter the character of 
your handwriting, yet they will assist 
to make your writing look better. 



783. THE paper on which you 
should be clean, and neatly f'ulded 

784. THERE should not be stains on 
the envelope ; if otherwise, it is only an 
indication of your own slovenliness. 

785. CARE must be taken in giving 
titled persons, to whom you write, their 
proper directions. 

786. BITING THE NAILS. This 
is a habit that should be immediately 
corrected in children, as, if persisted 
in for any length of time, it perma- 
nently deforms the nails. Dipping 
the finger-ends in some bitter tincture 
will generally prevent children from 
putting them to the mouth ; but if 
this fails, as it sometimes will, each 
finer-end ought to be encased in a 
stall until the propensity is eradicated. 

787. TO FILL A DECAYED 
TOOTH. Procure a small piece of 
gutta percha, drop it into boiling w r ater, 
then, with the thumb and finger, take 
off as much as you suppose will fill up 
the tooth nearly level, and while in thiw 
soft state press it into the tooth ; then 
hold on that side of the mouth cold 
water two or three times, which will 
harden it. 

788. TO RESTORE HAIR 
WHEN REMOVED BY ILL 
HEALTH OR AGE. Onions rub- 
bed frequently on the part requiring it. 
The stimulating powers of this vege- 
table are of service in restoring the 
tone of the skin, and assisting the ca- 
pillary vessels in sending forth new 
hair ; but it is not infallible. Should it 
succeed, however, the growth of these 
new hairs may be assisted by the oil 
of myrtle-berries, the repute of which, 
perhaps, is greater than its real effi- 
cacy. These applications are cheap 
and harmless, even where they do no 
good; a character which cannot be 
said of the numerous quack remedies 
that meet the eye in every direction. 

789. BIRDS' EGGS. In selecting 
eggs for a cabinet, always choose those 
which are newly laid ; make a medium 
sized hole at the sharp end with a 
pointed instrument : having made the 
hole at the sharp end, make one at the 



144 



ONE TO-DAY IS WORTH TWO TO-MORROW. 



blunt, and let this last hole be us small 
as possible ; this done, apply your 
mouth to the blunt end, and blow the 
contents through the sharp end. If 
the yolk will not come freely, run a 
pin or wire up into the egg, and stir 
the yelk well about ; now get a cupfui 
of water, and, immersing the sharp end 
of the shell into it, apply your mouth 
to the blunt end, and suck up some of 
the water into the empty shell ; then 
put your finger and thumb upon the 
two holes, shake the water well with- 
in, and, after this, blow it out. The 
water will clear your egg- of any re- 
mains of yolk, or of white, which may 
etay in after blowing. If one suck up 
of water will not suffice, make a second 
or third. An egg, immediately after it 
is produced, is very clear and fine; 
but by staying in the nest, and coming 
in contact with the feet of the bird, it 
soon assumes a dirty appearance. To 
remedy this, wash it well in soap and 
water, and use a nail-brush to get the 
dirt off. Your egg-shell is now as it 
ought to be, and nothing remains to 
be done but to prevent the thin white 
membrane (which is still inside) from 
corrupting; take a wine-glass and fill 
it with the solution of corrosive subli- 
mate in alcohol, then immerse the sharp 
end of the egg-shell into it, keeping 
your finger and thumb, as you hold it, 
just clear of the solution ; apply yonr 
mouth to the little hole at the blunt 
end, and suck up some of the solution 
into the shell ; you need not be fearful 
of getting the liquor into your mouth, 
for, as soon i,s it rises in the shell, the 
cold will strike your finger and thumb, 
arid then you cease sucking; shake the 
shell just as you did when the water 
was in it, and then blow the solution 
back into the glass. Your egg-shell is 
now beyond the reach of corruption ; 
the membrane for ever retains its pris- 
tine whiteness, and no insect for the 
time to come will ever venture to prey 
upoii it. If you wish your egg to ap- 
pear extremely brilliant, give it a coat 
of mastic varnish, put on very sparingly 
with a camel-hair pencil ; green or 



blue eggs must be done with gum 
arable; the mastic varnish is apt to in- 
jure the colour. 

790. PRESERVING EGGS. Th 
several modes recommended for pre- 
serving eggs any length of time are 
not always successful. The egg, to be 
preserved well, should be kept at a 
temperature so low that the air and 
fluids within its shell shall not be 
brought into a decomposing condition; 
and, at the same time, the air outside 
of its shell should be excluded, in order 
to prevent its action in any way upon 
the egg. The following mixture was 
patented several years ago by a Mr. 
Jayne. He alleged that by means ol 
it he could keep eggs two years. A 
part of his composition is often made 
use of perhaps the whole of it would 
be better. Put. into a tub or vessel one 
bushel of quick-lime, two pounds of salt, 
half a pound of cream-of tartar, and mix 
the same together, with as much water 
as will reduce the composition, or mix- 
ture, to that consistence that it will 
cause an egg put into it to swim with 
its top just above the liquid ; then put 
and keep the eggs therein. 

791. GOSSIPING. If you wish to 
cultivate a gossiping, meddling, censo- 
rious spirit in your children, be sure 
when they come home from church, a 
visit, or any other place where you do 
not accompany them, to ply them with 
questions concerning what everybody 
wore, how everybody looked, and what 
everybody said and did ; and if you 
find anything in this to censure, always 
do it in their hearing. You may rest 
assured, if you pursue a course of this 
kind, they will not return to you un- 
laden with intelligence; and rather than 
it should be uninteresting, they will by 
degrees learn to embellish, in such a 
returner as shall not fail to call forth re- 
marks and expressions of wonder from 
you. You will, by this course, render 
the spirit of curiosity, which is BO early 
visible in children and which, if lightly 
directed, may be "uade the instrument 
of enrichi ng and en la- ging thei r minxls 



LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OK EVERYTHING. 



145 



a vehicle of mischief which shall serve 
only to narrow them. 

792. WORDS. Soft words soften 
the soul. Angry words are fuel to the 
flame of wrath, and make it blaze more 
freely. Kind words make other peo- 
ple good-natured cold words freeze 
people, and hot words scorch them, and 
bitter words make them bitter, and 
wrathful words make them wrath- 
ful. There is such a rush of all other 
kinds of words in our days, that it seems 
desirable to give kind words a chance 
among them. There are vain words, 
and idle words, and hasty words, and 
spiteful words, and silly words, and 
empty words, and profane words, and 
boisterous words, and warlike words. 
Kind words also produce their own 
image on men's souls, and a beautiful 
image it is. They smooth, and quiet, 
and comfort the hearer. They shame 
him out of his sour, aud morose, and 
unkind feelings. We have not yet be- 
gun to use kind words in such abund- 
ance as they ought to be used. 

793. PICKLING. Do not keep 
pickles in common earthen-ware, as the 
glazing contains lead, and combines 
with the vinegar. Vinegar for pickling 
should be sharp, though not the sharp- 
est kind, as it injures the pickles. If 
you use copper, bell-metal, or brass ves- 
sels, for pickling, never allow the vine- 
gar to cool in them, as it then is poison- 
ous. Add a teaspoonful of alum, and 
a teacup of salt to each three gallons 
of vinegar, and tie up a bag with pepper, 
ginger-root, spices of all the different 
sorts in it, and you have vinegar pre- 
pared for any kind of pickling. Keep 
pickles only in wood or stone-ware. 
Anything that has held grease will 
spoil pickles. Stir pickles occasionally, 
and if there are soft ones take them out 
and scald the vinegar, and pour it hot 
over the pickles. Keep enough vine- 
gar to cover them well. If it is weak, 
take fiesh vinegar and pour on hot. 
Do not boil vinegar or spice above five 
minutes. 

794. YULECAKE. Take one 
pound of fresh butter, one pound of su- 



gar, one pound and a half of flour, two 
pounds of currants, a glass of brandy, 
one pound of sweetmeats, two ounces 
of sweet almonds, ten eggs, a quarter ol 
an ounce of allspice, aud n quarter oi 
an ounce of cinnamon. Melt the but 
ter to a cream, and put in the sugar. 
Stir it till quite liyht, adding the all 
spice and pounded cinnamon ; in a 
quarter of an hour, take the yolks oi 
the eggs, and work them two or three at 
a time ; and the whites of the same must 
by this time be beaten into a strong snow, 
quite ready to work in. As the paste 
must not stand to chill the butter, or it 
will be heavy, work in the whites gra- 
dually, then add the orange-peel, lem- 
on, and citron, cut in fine stripes, and 
currants which must be mixed in well 
with the sweet almonds ; then add 
the sifted flour and glass of brandy. 
Bake this cake in a tin hoop, in a hot 
oven, for three hours, and put twelve 
sheets of paper under it to keep it from 
burning. 

795. TO WASH CHINA CRAPE 
SCARFS, &c. If the fabric be good, 
these articles of dress can be washed as 
frequently as may be required, and no 
diminution of their beauty will be dis- 
coverable, even when the various shades 
of green have been employed among 
other colours in the patterns. In 
cleaning them make a strong lather 
of boiling water ; suffer it to cool ; 
when cold, or nearly so, wash the scarf 
quickly and thoroughly, dip it imme- 
diately in cold hard water in which 
a little salt has been thrown (to pre- 
serve the colours), rince, squeeze, and 
hang it out to dry in the open air ; pin 
it at its extreme edge to the line, so 
that it may not in any part be folded 
together ; the more rapidly it dries the 
clearer it will be. 

796. ADVICE TO YOUNG LA 
DIES. 

797. If you have blue eyes, you need 
not languish. 

798. If black eyes, you need net 
stare. 

799. If you have pretty feet there ii 
no occasion to we&/ short petticoats. 



146 



READ NOT BOOKS ALONE, BUT MEN ; 



800. If you are doubtful as to that 
point, there can be no harm in letting 
them be long. 

801 . If you have good teeth, do not 
laugh for the purpose of showing 
them. 

802. If you have bad ones, do not 
laugh less than the occasion may justify. 

803. If you have pretty hands and 
arms, there can be no objection to your 
playing on the harp if you pkiy well. 

804. If they are disposed to be 
clumsy, work tapestry. 

805. If you have a bad voice rather 
speak in a low tone. 

806. If you have the finest voice in 
the world, never speak in a high tone. 

807. If you dance well, dance but 
seldom. 

808. If you dance ill, never dance at 
all. 

809. If you sing w r ell, make no pre- 
vious excuses. 

810. If you eing indifferently, hesi- 
tate not a moment when you are asked, 
for few people are judges of singing, 
but every one is sensible of a desire to 
please. 

811. If you would preserve beauty, 
rise early. 

812. If you would preserve esteem, 
be gentle. 

813. If you would obtain power, be 
condescending. 

814. If you would live happy, endea- 
vour to promote the happiness of 
others. 

815. TO EXTRACT GREASE- 
SPOTS, FROM BOOKS OR PA- 
PER. Gently warm the greased or 
spotted part of the book or paper, and 
then press upon it pieces of blotting- 
paper, one after another,- so as to ab- 
sorb as much of the grease as possible. 
Have ready some fine clear essential 
oil of turpentine heated almost to a 
boiling state, warm the greased leaf a 
little, and then, with a soft clean brush, 
wet the heated turpentine both sides 
of the spotted part. By repeating this ! 
application, the grease will be extract- j 
ed. Lastly, with another brush, dip- j 
ped in rectified spirits -f wine, go over j 



the place, and the grease will no longei 
appear, neither will the paper be dig- 
coloured. 

816. TO PRESERVE Mil K.- 
Provide bottles, which must be perfectly 
clean, sweet, and dry: draw the milk 
from the cow into th^ bottles, and as 
they are filled, immediately cork them 
well up, and fasten the corks with pack- 
thread or wire. Then spread a little 
straw at the bottom of a boiler, on 
which place bottles with straw between 
them, until the boiler contains a suf- 
ficient quantity. Fill it up with cold 
water ; heat the water, and as soon aa 
it begins to boil, draw the fire, and let 
the whole gradually cool. When quite 
cold, take out the bottles and pack 
them in saw-dust, in hampers, and stow 
the'm in the coolest part of the house. 
Milk preserved in this manner, and al- 
lowed to remain even eighteen months 
in the bottles, will be as sweet as when 
first milked from the cow. 

817. GERMAN PASTE. German 
paste for cage birds, which will be 
found of better quality and cheaper 
than what is sold in the shops. Boil 
four eggs until quite hard, then throw 
them into cold water ; remove the 
white, and grate or pound the yolks 
until quite fine, and add a pound of 
w r hite peameal and a tablespoouful of 
olive oil. Mix the whole up together, 
and press the dough through a tin co- 
lander so as to form into small grains 
like shot. Fry them over a gentle 
fire, gradually stirring them until of n 
light brown colour, when they are fit 
for use. 

818. FRENCH POLISH FOR 
BOOTS AND SHOES. Mix together 
two pints of the best vinegar and one 
pint of soft- water ; stir into it a quarter 
of a pound of glue, broken up, half a 
pound of logwood chips, a quarter of 
an ounce of finely powdered indigo, a 
quarter of an cmnce of the best soft- 
soap, and a quarter of an ounce of 
isinglass. Put the mixture over the 
fire, and let it boil for ten minutes, or 
more. Then strain the liquid, and 
bottle and cork it. When cold, it is fit

for use. The polish should be applied 
with clean sponge. 

819. DAMP WALLS. The follow- 
ing method is recommended to prevent 
the effect of damp walls on paper in 
rooms: Line the damp part of the 
wall with sheet lead, rolled very thin, 
and fastened up with small copper nails. 
It may be immediately covered with 
paper. The lead is not to be thicker 
fchan that which lines tea-chests. 

820. TEA -MA KING. Dr. Kitch- 
ener recommends that all the water ne- 
cessary should be poured in at once as 
the second drawing is bad. When 
much tea is wanted, it is better to have 
two tea-pots instead of two drawings. 

821. RICE-FLOUR CEMENT. 
An excellent cement may be made from 
rice flour, which is at present used for 
that purpose in China and Japan. It is 
only necessary to mix the rice-flour in- 
timately with cold water, and gently 
simmer it over a fire, when it readily 
forms a delicate and durable cement, 
not only answering all the purposes 
of common paste, but admirably adap- 
ted for joining together paper, cards, 
&c., in forming the various beautiful 
and tasteful ornaments which affords 
much employment and amusement to the 
ladies. When made of the consistence 
of plaster clay, models, busts, bas-re- 
lievos, &c. maybe formed of it, and the 
articles when dry, are susceptible of 
high polish, and very durable. 

822. RULES OF CONDUCT. 
We cannot do better than quote the 
valuable injunctions of that excellent 
woman, Mrs. Fry, who combined in her 
character and conduct all that is truly 
excellent in woman : 1 I never lose 
any time ; I do not think that lost 
which is spent in amusement or recre- 
ation some time every day ; but always 
be in the habit of being employed. 2. 
Never err the least in truth. 3. Never 
^say any ill thing of a person when thou 

canst say a good thing of him ; not only 
speak charitably, but feel so. 4. Never 
bo irritable or unkind to anybody. 5. 
Never indulge thyself in luxuries that 
are not necessary. 6. Do all things 
7 



with consideration ; and, when thy path 
to act right is most difficult, feel confi- 
dence in that Power alone which is 
able to assist thee," and exert thy own 
powers as far as they go. 

823. FOOD OF BLACKBIRDS. 
The natural food of the blackbird is 
berries, worms, insects, shelled-snails, 
cherries, and other similar fruit ; and 
its artificial food, lean fresh meat, cut 
very small, and mixed with bread, or 
German paste. 

824. CRAMP IN BATHING. 
For the cure of the cramp when swim- 
ming, Dr. Franklin recommends a vig 
orous and violent shock to the part 
affected, by suddenly and forcibly 
stretching out the leg, which should be 
darted out of the water into the air if 
possible. 

825. TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE 
IN A CHIMNEY. Throw some 
powdered brimstone on the fire in the 
grate, or ignite some on the hob, and 
then put a board or something in the 
front of the fire-place to prevent the 
fumes descending into the room. The 
vapour of the brimstone ascending the 
chimney will then effectually extinguish 
the soot on fire. (See 524, 695.) 

826. TO GET RID OF A BAD 
SMELL IN A ROOM NEWLY 
PAINTED. Place a vessel full of 
lighted charcoal in the middle of the 
room, and throw on it two or three 
handfuls of juniper berries ; shut the 
windows, the chimney, and the door 
close; twenty-four hours afterwards, 
the room may be opened, when it will 
be found that the sickly unwholesome 
smell will be entirely gone. The smoke 
of the juniper berry possesses this ad- 
vantage, that should anything be left 
in the room, such as tapestry, &c., none 
of it will be spoiled. 

827. RICE DUMPLINGS. Pick 
and wash a pound of rice, and boil it 
gently in two quarts of water till it be- 
comes dry keeping the pot well 
covered, and not stirring- it. Then take 
it oft the fire \nd spread it out to cool 
on the bottom of an inverted sieve, 
loosening the grains lightly with a fork. 



148 



WITHOUT ECONOMY, NONE CAN BE RICH ; 



that all the moisture may evaporate. 
Pare a dozen pippins, or some large 
juicy apples and scoop out the core, 
then fill up the cavity with marmalade, 
or with lemon and sugar. Cover every 
apple all over with a thick coating of 
the boiled rice. Tie up each in a sepa- 
rate cloth, and put them into a pot of 
cold water. They will require about 
an hour and a quaiter after they begin 
to boil, perhaps longer. 

828. COUGHS. It is said that a 
small piece of resin dipped in the water 
which is placed in a vessel on a stove 
(not an open fire-place), will add a 
peculiar property to the atmosphere of 
the room, w ? hich will give great relief 
to persons troubled with a cough. The 
heat of the stove is sufficient to throw 
off the aroma of the resin, and gives 
the same relief that is afforded by the 
combustion, because the evaporation is 
more durable. The same resin may be 
used for weeks. 

829. METHOD OF ASCERTAIN- 
ING THE STATE OF THE 
LUNGS. Persons desirous of ascer- 
taining the true state of their lungs, are 
directed to draw in as much breath as 
they conveniently can ; they are then 
to count as far as they are able, in a 
slow and audible voice, without draw- 
ing in more breath. The number of 
seconds they can continue counting 
must be carefully observed ; in a con- 
sumption the time does not exceed ten, 
and is frequently less than six seconds ; 
in pleurisy and pneumonia it ranges 
from nine to four seconds. When the 
lungs are in a sound condition, the time 
will range as high as from twenty to 
thirty-five seconds. 

830. TO PRESERVE STEEL 
GOODS FROM RUST. After bright 
grates have been thoroughly cleaned, 
they should be dusted over with un- 
slaked lime, and thus left until want- 
ed. All the coils of piano wires are 
thus sprinkled, and will keep from rust 
for many years. Table-knives which 
are not in constant use, ought to be put 
in a case in which sifted quicklime is 
placed about eight inches deep. They 



should be plunged to the top of th 
blades, but the lime should not touch 
the bundles. 

831. HOW TO GET SLEEP. 
How to get sleep is to many pereons a 
matter of high importance. Nervou 
persons who are troubled with wake 
fulness and excitability, usually have 
strong- tendency of blood on the brain 
with cold extremities. The pressur 
of the blood on the brain keeps it in 
stimulated or wakeful state, and th 
pulsations in the head are often painful 
Let such rise and chafe the body and 
extremities with a brush or towel, ol 
rub smartly with the hands to promote 
circulation, and withdraw the excessive 
amount of blood from the brain, and 
they will fall asleep in a few moments. 
A cold bath, or a sponge bath and rub- 
bing, or a good run, or a rapid walk in 
the open air, or going up or dow 7 n 
stairs a few times just before retiring, 
will aid in equalising circulation and 
promoting- sleep. These rules are 
simple and easy of application in castle 
or cabin, and may minister to the com- 
fort of thousands who would freely 
expend money for an anodyne to pro- 
mote " Nature's sweet restorer, balmy 
sleep ?" 

832. TURKISH MODE OF 
MAKING COFFEE. The Turkish 
way of making- coffee produces a very 
different result from that to which we 
are accustomed. A small conical 
saucepan, with a long handle, and cal- 
culated to hold about two table-spoon- 
fuls of water, is the instrument used 
The fresh roasted berry is pounded, 
not ground, and about a dessert-spoon- 
ful is put into the minute boiler ; it is 
then nearly filled with water, and thrust 
among the embers. A few seconds 
suffice to make it boil, and the decoc- 
tion, grounds and all, is poured out into 
a small cup, which fits into & brass 
socket, much -like the cup of an acorn, 
and holding the china cup as that does 
the acorn itself. The Turks seem to 
drink this decoction boiling, and swal- 
low the grounds with the liquid. We 
allow it to remain a minute, in order to 



WITH ECONOMY, FEW NEED BE POOH. 



149 



leave the sediment at the bottom. It 
ip always taken plain ; sugar or cream 
would be thought to spoil it ; and Eu- 
ropeans, after a little practice (longer, 
however, than we had) are said to 
prefer it to the clear infusion drunk in 
France. In every hut you will see 
these coffee boilers suspended, and the 
means for pounding the roasted berry 
will always be found ready at hand. 

833. HOW TO TREAT A WIFE. 
First, get a wife ; secondly, be pa- 
tient. You may have great trials and 
perplexities in your business with the 
world, but do not carry to your home 
a clouded or contracted brow. Your 
wife may have had many trials, which, 
though of less magnitude, may have 
been as hard to bear. A kind, con- 
ciliating word, a tender look, will do 
wonders in chasing from her brow ail 
clouds of gloom. You encounter your 
difficulties in the open air, fanned by 
heaven's cool breezes ; but your wife 
is often shut in from these healthful 
influences, and her health fails, and 
her spirits lose their elasticity. But 
oh ! bear with her ; she has trials and 
sorrows to which you are a stranger, 
but which your tenderness can deprive 
of all their anguish. Notice kindly her 
little attentions and efforts to promote 
your comfort. Do not treat her with 
indifference, if you would not sear and 
palsy her heart, which, watered by 
kindness, would, to the latest day of 
your existence, throb with sincere and 
constant affection. Sometimes yield 
your wishes to hers. She has prefer- 
ences as strong as you, and it may be 
just as trying to yield her choice as to 
you. Do you find it hard to yield 
sometimes ? Think you it is not dif- 
ficult for her to give up always 1 If 
you never yield to her wishes, there is 
danger that she will think you are 
selfish, and care only for yourself, and 
with such feelings she cannot love as 
ehe might. Again, show yourself 
manly, so that your wife can look up 
at you and feel that you will act nobly, 
and that she can confide in yoi;r judg- 
ment. (See 191 to 202.) 



834. TO REMOVE WATER 
STAINS FROM BLACK CRAPE 
When a drop of water falls on a 
black crape veil or collar, it leaves a 
conspicuous white mark. To obliterate 
this, spread the crape on a table (laying 
on it a large book or a paper-weight to 
keep it steady), and place underneath 
the stain a piece of old black silk. 
With a large camel's-hair brush dipped 
in common ink, go over the stain ; and 
then wipe off the ink with a little bit, 
of old soft silk. It will dry immediate- 
ly, and the white mark will be seen n<* 
more. 

835. CLEANLINESS, it is said,haa 
a powerful influence on the health and 
preservation of the body. Cleanliness, 
as well in our garments as in our 
dwellings, prevents the pernicious ef- 
fects of dampness, of bad smells, and 
of contagious vapours arising from sub- 
stances abandoned to putrefy ; cleanli- 
ness keeps up a free perspiration, 
renews the air, refreshes the blood, 
and even animates and enlivens the 
mind. Whence we see that persons 
attentive to the cleanliness of their 
persons and their habitations, are in 
general more healthy, and less exposed 
to diseases than those who live in filth 
and nastiness ; and it may moreover 
be remarked, that cleanliness brings 
with it, throughout every part of do- 
mestic discipline, habits of order and 
arrangement, which are among the 
first and best methods and elements of 
happiness. 

836. FIRST-WATCH STEW. 
Cut pieces of salt beef and pork into 
dice, put them into a stew-pan with 
six whole peppercorns two blades of 
mace, a few cloves, a tea-spoonful of 
celery-seeds, and a faggot of dried 
sweet herbs ; cover with water, and 
stew gently for an hour, then add frag- 
ments of carrots, turnips, parsley, or 
any other vegetables at hand, with two 
sliced onions, and some vinegar to fla- 
vour ; thicken with flour or rice, re- 
move the herba, and pour into the dish 
with toasted bread, or freshly baked 
biscuit broken small, and serve hot 



ioO 



TIIERE IS NO GRIEF LIKE THE GRIEF WHICH DDKS MOT Sl'KAK. 



When they can be procured, a few 
potatoes improve it very much. 

8:;?. SEVEN-BELL PASTY. 
Shred a pound of euet fine, cut salt pork 
into dice, potatoes and onions small, rub 
a sprig of dried sage up fine, mix with 
Home pepper, and place in the corner 
of a square piece of paste, turn over the 
other corner, pinch up the sides, and 
bake in a quick oven. If any bones, 
&c., remain from the meat, season with 
pepper and sage, place them with a gill 
of water in a pan, and bake with the 
pasty : when done, strain, and pour the 
gravy into the centre of the pasty. 

838. DIRECTIONS FOR TAK- 
ING LEAF IMPRESSIONS. Hold 
oiled paper in the smoke of a lamp, or 
of pitch, until it becomes coated with 
the smoke ; to this paper apply the leaf 
of which you wish an impression, hav- 
ing previously warmed it between your 
hands, that it may be pliable. Place the 
lower surface of the leaf upon the black- 
ened surface of the oil paper, that the 
numerous veins that are so prominent 
on this side may receive from the paper 
a portion of the smoke. Lay a paper 
over the leaf, and then press it gently 
upon the smoked paper, with the 
fingers, or with a small roller (covered 
with woollen cloth, or some like soft 
material), so that every part of the leaf 
may come in contact with the sooted 
oil-paper. A coating of the smoke will 
adhere to the leaf. Then remove the 
leaf carefully, and place the blackened 
surface on a sheet of white paper, not 
ruled, or in a book prepared for the 
purpose, covering the leaf with a 
clean slip of paper, and pressing upon 
it with the fingers, or roller, as before. 
Thus may be obtained the impression 
of a leaf, showing the perfect outlines, 
together with an accurate exhibition of 
the veins which extend in every direc- 
tion through it, more correctly than the 
finest drawing. And this process is so 
simple, and the materials so easily ob- 
tained, that any person, with a little 
practice to enable him to apply the right 
quantity of smoke to the oil-paper, and 
give the leaf a proper pressure, can pre- 



pare beautiful leaf impressions, such M 
a naturalist would be proud to possess 
There is another, and we think a bet- 
ter method of taking leaf impressions, 
than the preceding one. The only dif- 
ference in the process consists in the 
use of printing ink. instead of smoked 
oil-paper. 

8:59. LEAF PRINTING. After 
warming the leaf between the hands, 
apply printing ink, by means of a small 
leather ball containing cotton, or some 
soft substance, or with the end of the 
finger. The leather ball (and the fin- 
ger when used for that purpose), after 
the ink is applied to it, should be 
pressed several times on a piece of 
leather, or some smooth surface, before 
each application to the leaf, that the 
ink may be smoothly and evenly ap- 
plied. After the under surface of the 
leaf has been sufficiently inked, apply 
it to the paper, where you wish the im- 
pression ; and, after covering it with a 
slip of paper, use the hand or roller to 
press upon it, as described in the for- 
mer process. 

840. PLANT SKELETONS. The 
leaves are to be put into an earthen or 
glass vessel, and a large quantity of 
rain-water to be poured over them; 
after this they are to be left to the 
open air and to the heat of the sun, 
without covering the vessel. When the 
water evaporates so as to leave the 
leaves dry, more must be added in its 
place; the leaves will by this means 
putrefy, but they require a different 
time for this: some will be finished in 
a month, others will require two months 
or longer according to the toughness of 
their parenchyma. When they have 
been in a state of putrefaction for some 
time, the tw r o membranes will begin to 
separate, and the green part of the leaf 
to become fluid : then the operation of 
clearing is to be performed. The leaf 
is to be put upon a fiat white earthen 
plate and covered with clear water; 
and being gently squeezed with the 
finger, the membranes will begin to 
open, and the green substance will 
come out at the edges ; the membrane*

151 



must be carefully taken off with the 
finger, and great caution must be used 
in separating them near the middle rib. 
When once there is an opening towards 
this separation, the whole membrane 
always follows easily ; when both mem- 
branes are taken off, the skeleton is 
finished, and it has to be washed clean 
with water, and then dried between 
the leaves of a book. Fruits are_ di- 
vested of their pulp and made into 
skeletons in a different manner. Take, 
for an instance, a fine large pear which 
is soft, and not tough ; let it be neatly 
pared without squeezing it, and without 
injuring either the crown or the stalk ; 
put it into a pot of rain-water, covered, 
set it over the fire, and let it boil gently 
till perfectly soft, then take it out and 
lay it in a dish filled with cold water ; 
then holding it by the stalk with one 
hand, rub off as much of the pulp as 
you can with the ringer and thumb, be- 
ginning at the stalk, and rubbing it re- 
gularly towards the crown. The fibres 
are most tender towards the extremities, 
and are therefore to be treated with 
great care there. When the pulp has thus 
been cleared pretty well off, the point 
of a fine pen-knife may be of use to 
pick away the pulp sticking to the core. 
In order to see how the operation ad- 
vances, the soiled water must be thrown 
away from time to time, and clean 
poured on in its place. When the pulp 
is in this manner perfectly separated, 
the clean skeleton is to be preserved in 
spirits of wine. This method may be 
pursued with the bark of trees, which 
afford interesting views of their consti- 
tuent fibres. 

841. ROLLS. Mix the salt with 
the flour. Make a deep hole in the 
middle. Stir the warm water into the 
yeast, and pour it into the hole in the 
flour. Stir it with a spoon just enough 
to make a thin batter, and sprinkle 
Borne Hour over the top. Cover the 
pan, and set it in a warm place for 
several hours. When it is light, add 
half a pint more of lukewarm water, 
and make it, with a little more flour, 
into a dong i. Knead it very well for ten 



minutes. Then divide it into small 
pieces, and knead each separately. 
Make them into round cakes or rolls. 
Cover them, and set them to rise about 
an hour and a half. Bake them, and, 
when done, .ler them remain in the 
oven, without the lid, for about ten 
minutes. 

842. EARLY RISING. Dr. Wilson 
Philip, in his " Treatise on Indigestion," 
says : " Although it is of consequence 
to the debilitated to go early to bed, 
there are few things more hurtful to 
them than remaining in it too long. 
Getting up an hour or two earlier, often 
gives a degree of vigour which nothing 
else can procure. For those who are 
not much debilitated and sleep well, 
the best rule is to get out of bed soon 
after waking in the morning. This at 
first may appear too early, for the 
debilitated require more sleep than the 
healthy ; but rising early will gradu- 
ally prolong the sleep on the succeed- 
ing night till the quantity the patient 
enjoys is equal to his demand for it. 
Lying late is not only hurtful, by the 
relaxation it occasions, but also by 
occupying that part of the day at which 
exercise is most beneficial." 

843. SUPERIOR CLEANLINESS 
sooner attracts our regard than even 
finery itself, and often gains esteem 
where the other fails. 

844. COFFEE A DISINFECT- 
ANT. Numerous experiments with 
roasted coffee prove that it is the most 
powerful means, not only of rendering 
animal and vegetable effluvia innoc- 
uous, but of absolutely destroying them. 
A room in which meat in an advanced 
degree of decomposition had been kept 
for some time, was instantly deprived 
of all smell on an open coffee-roaster 
being carried through it, containing a 
pound of coffee newly roasted. In 
another room, exposed to the effluvium 
occasioned by the clearing out of the 
dung-pit, so that sulphuretted hydrogen 
and ammonia in great quantities could 
t>e chemically detected, the stench was 
completely removed in half a minute, 
on tl 9 employ ment of three ounces of 



15U 



ONE WATCH SET EIGHT "WILL DO TO SET MANY I3Y ; 



fresh roasted coffee, whilst the other 
parts of the he use were permanently 
cleared of the same smell by being 
simply traversed with the coff;>- roaster, 
although the cleansing of the dung-pit 
continued for several hours at:er. The 
best mode of using the coffee as a 
disinfectant is to dry the raw bean, 
pound it in a mortar, and then roast 
the powder on a moderately heated 
iron plate, until it assumes a dark brown 
tint, when it is fit for use. Then 
sprinkle it in sinks or cess-pools, or lay 
it on a plate in the room which you 
wish to have purified. Coffee acid or 
coffee oil acts more readily in minute 
quantities. 

845. UTILITY OF SINGING. 
It is asserted, and we believe with some 
truth, that singing is a corrective of the 
too common tendency to pulmonic com- 
plaints. Dr. Rush, an eminent physi- 
cian, observes on this subject : " The 
Germans are seldom afflicted with con- 
sumption ; and this, I believe, is in part 
occasioned by the strength which their 
lungs acquire by exercising them in 
vocal music, for this constitutes an es- 
sential branch of their education. The 
music master of an academy has fur- 
nished me with a remark still more in 
favour of this opinion. He informed 
me that he had known several instances 
of persons who were strongly disposed 
to consumption, who were restored to 
health by the exercise of their lungs in 
singing. 

846. DOMESTIC RULES. 1. Do 
every thing in its proper time. 2. Keep 
everything to its proper use. 3. Put 
everything in its proper place. 

847. THE CHEMICAL BARO- 
METER. Take a long narrow bottle, 
such as an old-fashioned Eau-de-Co- 
logne bottle, and put into it two and a 
half drachms of camphor, and eleven 
drachms of spirits of wine; when the 
camphor is dissolved, which it will 
readily do by slight agitation, add the 
following mixture : Take water, nine 
drachms: nitrate of potash (saltpetre), 
thirty- eight grains; and I'.uriate of am- 
monia (sal amironias) thirty-eight 



grains. Dissolve these salts in the 
water prior to mixing with the cam 
phorated spirit ; then shake the whole 
well together. Cork the bottle well, 
and wax the top, but afterwards make 
a very small aperture in the cork with 
a red-hot needle. The bottle may 
then be hung up, or placed in any 
stationary position. By observing 
the different appearances which the 
materials assume, as the weather 
changes, it becomes an excellent prog- 
nosticator of a coming storm or of a 
sunny sky. 

848. FRUGALIT Y. The great 
philosopher, Dr. Franklin, inspired the 
mouth-piece of his own eloquence, 
" Pool Richard," with " many a gem 
of purest ray serene," encased in the 
homely garb of proverbial truisms. On 
the subject of frugality we cannot do 
better than take the worthy Mentor for 
our text, and from it address our re- 
marks. A man may, if he knows not 
how to save as he gets, " keep his nose 
all his life to the grindstone, and die not 
worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen 
makes a lean will," and 

" Many estates are spent in getting-, 
Since women for tea forsook spin 

ning and knitting, 

And men for punch forsook hewing 
and splitting." 

849. IF you would be wealthy, think 
of saving as well as of getting. The In- 
dies have not made Spain rich, because 
her out-goes are greater than her in- 
comes. 

850. AWAY then with your expen- 
sive follies, and you will not then 
have so much cause to complain of 
hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable 



851. " What maintains one vice 
would bring up two children." 

852. You may think, perhaps, that a 
ittle tea, or superfluities now and then, 
diet a little more costly, clothes a little 
finer, and a little entertainment now 
and then, can be no great matter ; but 
remember, " many a little makes a 
mickle." 



ONE THAT GOES WRONG MAY MISLEAD A WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD. 



153 



853. BEWARE of little expenses: 
" A email leak will sink a great ship," 
as Poor Richard says : and again, 
" Who dainties love, shall beggars 
pvove ;" and moreover, " Fools make 
leasts and wise men eat them." 

854. HERE you are all got together 
to this sale of fineries and nick-nacks. 
You call them goods; but if you do 
not take care they will prove evils to 
Borne of you. You expect they will be 
sold cheap, and perhaps they may for 
less than they cost; but if you have no 
occasion for them they must be dear to 
you. 

855. REMEMBER what poor Richard 
says, " Buy what thou hast no need of, 
and ere long thou ehalt sell thy neces- 
saries." 

856. AND again, " At a great penny- 
worth, pause awhile." He means, per- 
haps, that the cheapness is apparent 
only, and not real ; or the bargain, by 
straitening thee in thy business, may 
do thee more harm than good ; for in 
another place he says, "Many have 
been ruined by buying good penny- 
Vorths." 

857. AGAIN, " It is foolish to lay out 
money in the purchase of repentance ;" 
and yet this folly is practised every day 
at auctions, for want of minding the 
almanac. 

858. MANY, for the sake of finery on 
the back, have gone with a hungry 
Btomach, and half starved their fa- 
milies. " Silks and satins, scarlets 
and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,' 
as Poor Richard says. These are not 
the necessaries of life; they can 
scarcely be called the conveniencies 
and yet, only because they look pretty 
how majiy want to have them ? 

859. BY these and other extrava 
gances, the genteel are reduced t< 
poverty, and forced to borrow of thos< 
whom they formerly despised, but who 
through industry and frugality havf 
maintained their standing: in whict 
case it appears plainly that, " A 
ploughman on his legs is higher than a 
gentleman on his knees," as PforRich- 
ird swj s Pe 'haps thev had i small 



estate left them, which they knew not 

begetting of; they think "It is day, 
and will nevei benight;" that a little 

o be spent out of so much is not worth 
minding ; but ' Always taking out of 

;he meal-tub, and never putting in, 
soon comes to the bottom," as Poor 

Richard says ; and then, " When the 
well is dry, they know the worth of 
water." 

860. BUT this they might have 
known before, if they had taken his 
advice : " If you would know the 
value of money, go and try to borrow 
some ; for he that goes a borrowing 
goes a sorrowing , ' as Poor Richard 
says; and, indeed, so does he that 
lends to such people, when he goes to 
get it in again. Poor Dick further 
advises : 

" Fond pride of dress is sure a very 

curse ; 
Ere fancy you consult, consult 

your purse." 

861. AND again, " Pride is as loud a 
beggar as want, and a great deal more 
saucy." 

862. WHEN you have bought one 
fine thing, you must buy ten more, 
that your appearance may be all of a 
piece ; but Poor Dick says, " It is 
easier to suppress the first desire than 
to satisfy all that follow it ;" and it is 
as truly folly for the poor to ape the 
rich, as for the frog to swell in order 
to equal the ox. 

" Vessels large may venture more, 
But little boats should keep near 
shore." 

*862. IT is, however, a folly soon pun- 
ished ; for " Pride that dines on vani- 
ty, sups on contempt ; pride breakfast- 
ed with plenty, dined with poverty, and 
supped with infamy. 

863. AND, after all, of what use i 
this pride of appearance, for which so 
muck is risked, so much is suffered ? 
It cannot promote health, nor ease 
pain ; it makes no increase of merit in 
.the person ; it creates envy, it hastens 
misfortune.

EVERY PEA HELPS TO FILL THE PECK. 



864. CONVERSATION. 

865. There are many talkers, but 
few who know how to converse agree- 
ably. (See 279, 3015.) 

866. Speak distinctly, neither too 
rapidly nor too slowly. 

867. Accommodate the pitch of your 
voice to the hearing of the person with 
whom you are conversing. 

868. Never speak with your mouth 
full. 

869. Tell your jokes and laugh af- 
terwards. 

870. Dispense with superfluous 
words such as " Well, I should 
think." 

871. The woman who wishes her 
conversation to be agreeable will avoid 
conceit or affectation, and laughter, 
which is not natural and spontaneous. 
Her language will be easy and un- 
studied, marked by a graceful careless- 
ness, which, at the same time, never 
oversteps the limits of propriety. Her 
lips will readily yield to a pleasant 
smile ; she will not love to hear her- 
self talk ; her tones will bear the im- 
press of sincerity, and her eyes kindle 
with animation, as she speaks. The 
art of pleasing is, in truth, the very 
soul of good breeding : for the precise 
object of the latter is to render us 
agreeable to all with whom we associ- 
ate ; to make us at the same time, es- 
teemed and loved. 

872. We need scarcely advert to the 
rudeness of interrupting any one who 
is speaking, or to the impropriety oi 
pushing, to its full extent, a discus'sion 
which has become unpleasant. 

873. Some men have a mania for 
Greek and Latin quotations; this is pe- 
culiarly to be avoided. It is like pull- 
ing up the stones from a tomb where- 
with to kill the living. Nothing is more 
wearisome than pedantry. 

874. If you feel your intellectual 
superiority to any one with whom 
you are conversing, do not seek to 
bear him down ; it would be an in 
glorious triumph, and a breach o 
good manners. Beware too of speak 



ng lightly of subjects which bear a 8* 
cred character. 

875. Witlings occasionally gain a 
reputation in society; but nothing ia 
nore insipid and in worse taste than 
:heir conceited harangues and self-suf- 
icient air. 

876. It is a common idea that the 
art cf writing and the art of couversa- 
;ion are one ; this is a great mistake. 
A man of genius may be a very dull 
talker. 

877. The two grand modes of making 
your conversation interesting, are to 
enliven it by recitals calculated to af- 
Fect and impress your hearers, and to 
intersperse it with anecdotes and smart 
things. Rivasol was a master in the 
latter mode. (See 1338.) 

87S CLEANLINESS. The want 
of cleanliness is a fault which admits of 
no excuse. Where water can be had 
for nothing, it is surely in the power of 
every person to be clean. 

879. THE discharge from our bodies, 
by perspiration, renders frequent 
changes of apparel necessary. 

880. CHANGE of apparel greatly pro- 
motes the secretion from the skin, so 
necessary to health. 

881. WHEN that matter which ought 
to be carried oft' by perspiration is either 
retained in the body, or re-absorbed by 
dirty clothes, it is apt to occasion fe- 
vers and other diseases. 

882. MOST Diseases of the Skin 
proceed from want of cleanliness. 
These indeed may be caught by infec- 
tion, bnt they will seldom continue long 
where cleanliness prevails. 

883. To the same cause must we im- 
pute the various kinds of vermin that 
infest the human body, houses, &c. 
These may generally be banished by 
cleanliness alone. 

884. PERHAPS the intention of na- 
ture, in permitting such vermin to an- 
noy mankind, is to induce them to tha 
practice of this virtue. 

885. ONE common cause of putrid 
and malignant fevers is the want of 
cleanliness. 

886. THESE fevers commonly begia 



TO DAY, MAN LIVES IN PLEASURE, WEALTH, AA'D PKIDE. 



155 



among the inhabitants of close dirty 
houses, who breathe bad air, take little 
exercise, use unwholesome food, and 
wear dirty clothes. There the infection 
is generally hatched, which spreads 
far and wide to the destruction of 
many. Hence cleanliness may be con- 
sidered as an object of the public atten- 
tion. 

887. IT is not sufficiei.t that I be 
clean myself, while the v ant of it in 
my neighbour affects my health as well 
as his own. 

888. IF dirty people cannot be re- 
moved as a common nuisance, they 
ought at least to be avoided as infec- 
tious. All who regard their health, 
should keep at a distance, even from 
their habitations. 

889. IN places where great numbers 
of people are collected, cleanliness be- 
comes of the utmost importance. 

890. IT is well known, that infec- 
tious diseases are caused by tainted 
air. Everything, therefore, which tends 
to pollute the air, or spread the infec- 
tion, ought with the utmost care to be 
avoided. 

891. FOR this reason, in great towns, 
no filth of any kind should be permitted 
to lie upon the streets. We are sorry 
to say, that the importance of general 
cleanliness does by no means seem to 
be sufficiently understood. 

892. IT were well if the lower class- 
es of the inhabitants of the United 
States would imitate the Dutch, in the 
cleanliness of their streets, houses, &c. 

893. WATER, indeed, is easily ob- 
tained in Holland ; but the situation of 
most towns in the United States is more 
favourable to cleanliness. 

894. NOTHING can be more agreea- 
ble to the senses, more to the honour of 
the inhabitants, or conducive to their 
health, than a clean town; nor does 
anything impress a stranger sooner with 
a disrespectful idea of any people than 
its opposite. 

895. IT is remarkable, that, in most 
eastern countries, cleanliness makes a 
great part of their religion. The Ma- 
hometan, as well lit; the Jewish reli- 

7* 



gion, enjoins various bathings, wash 
ings, and purifications. No doubt 
these were designed to represent in 
ward purity ; but they are at the same 
time calculated for the preservation of 
health. 

896. HOWEVER whimsical these 
washings may appear to some, few 
things would appear more to prevent 
diseases than a proper attention to many 
of them. 

897. WERE every person, for exam- 
ple, after handling a dead body, visit- 
ing the sick, &c., to wash before he went 
into company, or sat down to meat, he 
would run less hazard either of catch- 
ing the infection himself, or cominuni 
eating it to others. 

898. FREQUENT washing not only- 
removes the filth which adheres to the 
skin, but likewise promotes the per- 
spiration, braces the body, and enlivens 
the spirits. 

899. EVEN washing the feet tends 
greatly to preserve health. The sweat 
and dirt with which these parts are fre- 
quently covered, cannot fail to obstruct 
their perspiration. This piece of clean- 
liness would often prevent colds and 
fevers. 

900. WERE people to bathe their 
feet and hands in warm water at 
night, after being exposed to cold 
or wet through the day, they would 
seldom experience any of the fatal ef 
fects which often proceed from thesf 
causes. 

901 . IN places where great numbers 
of sick people are kept, cleanliness 
ought most religiously to be observed. 
The very smell in such places is often 
sufficient to make one sick. It is easy 
to imagine what effect that is likely to 
have upon the diseased. 

902. A PERSON in health has a 
greater chance to become sick, than n 
sick person has to get w r ell, in an hos- 
pital or infirmary where cleanliness is 
neglected. 

903. THE brutes themselves set us 
an example of cleanliness. Most of 
them seem uneasy, and thrive ill, if 
they be not kept clean. A horse that 



156 



TO-DAY, LAYS PLANS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME J 



is kept thoroughly dean, will thrive 
better on a sraalle: quantity of food, 
than \vith a greater where cleanliness 
is neglected. 

904. EVEN OUR OWN FEELINGS a e 
sufficient proof of the necessity of 
cleanliness. How refreshed, how cheer- 
ful and agreeable does one feel on be- 
ing shaved, washed and dressed ; espe- 
cially when these have been L-ng ne- 
glected. 

905. MOST PEOPLE esteem sleanli- 
iiess ; and even those who do i at prac- 
tise it themselves, often adnrre it in 
others. 

906. DOMESTIC PHARMACO- 
FCEIA. In compiling this part of our 
hints, we have endeavoured to supply- 
that kind of information that is so often 
wanted in the time of need, and can- 
not be obtained when a medical man or 
a druggist is not near. The doses are 
all fixed for adults, unless otherwise 
ordered. The various remedies are 
arranged in sections, according- to their 
uses, as being more easy for reference.

TO-DAY, IIE FLOATS OX HONOUR'S LOFTY \VAVK : 



1045. Gardening Operations. Con- 
tinue in open weather to prepare vacant 
ground for spring, and to protect plants 
from frost. Cover bulbous roots with 
matting. Dress Jlower borders. Pre- 
pjre forcing ground for cucumbers, and 
force asparagus and secale. Plant goose- 
berry, currant, apple and pear trees. 
Roll grass plats if the season be mild 
and not too wet. Prepare poles, stakes, 
pea-sticks, &c., for spring. 

1046. KITCHEN GARDEN. This is 
one of the most important parts of 
general domestic economy, whenever 
the situation of a house will permit a 
family to avail themselves of its assist- 
ance, in aid of butchers' bills. It is, 
indeed, much to be regretted that small 
plots of ground, in the immediate vici- 
nity of the metropolis more especially, 
are too often frittered away into shrub- 
beries and baby gardens, when they 
might more usefully be employed in 
raising vegetables for the family, during 
the week-day residence in town, than 
wasting their sweetness on the smoky 
air in all the pride of lilac, hollyhock, 
and batchelors' buttons, to be merely 
smelled to, by the whole immigrating 
household on the day of rest. With a 
little care and attention, a kitchen- 
garden, though small, might be ren- 
dered not only useful, but in fact, as 
ornamental as a modern grass carpet ; 
and the same expense incurred to make 
the ground a labyrinth of sweets, might 
suffice to render it agreeable to the 
palate, as well as to the olfactory 
nerves, arid that even without offending 
the most delicate optics. It is only in 
accordance with our plan to give the 
hint, and to record such novel points as 
may facilitate the proposed arrange- 
ment. It is one objection to the adop- 
tion of a kitchen-garden in front of the 
dwelling, or in sight of the family 
apartments, that its very nature makes 
it rather an eye-sore than otherwise at 
all seasons. This, however, is an ob- 
jection that may be readily got over by 
a little attention to neatness and good 
order, whilst the plants themselves, if 

attended to, and the borders 



sown or planted with ranunculus, poly 
anthus, mignionette, &c., in succession, 
will really be ornamental : but then, in 
cutting the plants for use, the business 
must be done neatly, all useless leaves 
cleared from the ground, the roots no 
longer wanted taken up, and the rav- 
ages of insects to be guarded against 
by sedulous extirpation. It will also bt 
found a great improvement, where 
space will admit of it, to surround tho 
beda with neat espaliers, with fruit 
trees, or even gooseberry and currant 
bushes trained along them, instead of 
these being suffered to grow in a state 
of ragged wildness. 

1047. TEMPERANCE. "If," ob- 
serves a writer, " men lived uniformly 
in a healthy climate, were possessed of 
strong and vigorous frames, were de- 
scended from healthy parents, were 
educated in a hardy and active manner, 
were possessed of excellent natural dis- 
positions, were placed in comfortable 
situations in life, were engaged only in 
healthy occupations, were happily con- 
nected in marriage, and kept their pas- 
sions in due subjection, there would be 
little occasion for medical rules." All 
this is very excellent and desirable; 
but unfortunately for mankind, unat- 
tainable. 

1048. MAN must be something more 
than man, to be able to connect the dif- 
ferent links of this harmonious chain 
to consolidate this summum bonum 
of earthly felicity into one uninterrupt- 
ed whole ; for independent of all regu- 
larity or irregularity of diet, passions, 
and other sublunary circumstances, con- 
tingencies, and connections, relative or 
absolute, thousands are visited by dis- 
eases and precipitated into the grave, 
independent of accident, to whom no 
particular vice could attach, and with 
whom the appetite never overstepped 
the boundaries of temperance. Do we 
not hear almost daily of instances Ot 
men living near to and even upwards of 
a century? We cannot account for 
this either; because of such men we 
know but few who have lived other- 
wise than ihe world around them ; and 



TO-MORROW, LEAVES HIS TITLES FOR A GRAVE. 



166 



we have known many who have lived 
in habitual intemperance for forty or 
fifty years without interruption and 
with little apparent inconvenience. 

3 049. THE assertion has been made 
by those who have attained a great age 
(Parr, and Henry Jenkins, forinstance,) 
that they adopted no particular arts for 
the preservation of their health ; con- 
sequently, it might bo inferred that the 
duration of life has no dependence on 
manners or customs, or the qualities of 
particular food. This, however, is an 
error of no common magnitude. 

1050. Labourers, and other hard- 
working people, more especially those 
whose occupations require them to be 
much in the open air, may be consider- 
ed as following a regulated system of 
moderation ; and hence the higher de- 
gree of health which prevails among 
them and their families. They also 
observe rules ; and those which it is 
said were recommended by Old Parr 
are remarkable for good sense ; namely, 
" keep your head cool by temperance, 
your feet warm by exercise ; rise early, 
and go soon to bed ; and if you are in- 
clined to get fat, keep your eyes open 
ami your mouth shut." In other 
words, sleep moderately, and be ab- 
stemious in diet; excellent admoni- 
tions, more especially to those inclined 
to corpulency. 

1051. THE ADVANTAGES to be de- 
rived from a reg-ular mode of living, 
with a view to the preservation of 
health and life, are nowhere better ex- 
emplified than in the precepts and 
practice of Plutarch, whose rules for 
this purpose are excellent ; and by ob- 
serving them himself, he maintained 
his bodily strength and mental faculties 
unimpaired to a very advanced age. 
Galen is a still stronger proof of the 
advantages of a regular plan, by means 
of which he reached the great age of 
140 years, without having ever experi- 
enced disease. His advice to the read- 
ers of his " Treatise on Health," is as 
ibllows: "I beseech all persons who 
shall read this work, not to degrade 
themselves to a level with the bn tea, 



or the rabble, by gratifying their sloth, 
or by eating and drinking promiscuous- 
ly whatever pleases their palates, or by 
indulging their appetites if every kind, 
But, whether they understand physic or 
not, let them consult their reason, and 
observe what agrees, and what does 
not agree with them, that, like wise 
men, they may adhere to the use of 
such things as conduce to their health, 
and forbear everything which, by their 
own experience, they find to do them 
hurt ; and let them be assured that, by 
a diligent observation and practice of 
this rule, they may enjoy a good share 
of health, and seldom stand in need of 
physic or physicians." 

1052. CHILDREN. Happy indeed 
is the child who, during the first period 
of its existence, is fed upon no other 
aliment than the milk of its mother, or 
that of a healthy nurse. If other food 
becomes necessary before the child has 
acquired teeth, it ought to be of a 
liquid form: for instance, biscuits or 
stale bread boiled in an equal mixture 
of milk and water, to the consistence 
of a thick soup ; but by no means even 
this in the first week of its life. 

1053. FLOUR OR MEAL ought never 
to be used for soup, as it produces 
viscid humours, instead of wholesome 
nutricious chyle. 

1054. AFTER THE FIRST six MONTHS 
weak veal or chicken broth may be 
given, and also, progressively, vegeta- 
bles that are not very flatulent ; for in- 
stance, carrots, endive, spinach, pars- 
nips, with broth and boiled fruit, such 
as apples, pears, plums, and cherries. 

1055. WHEN THE INFANT is WEAN- 
ED, and has acquired its proper teeth, it is 
advisable to let it have small portions of 
meat and other vegetables ; as well as 
dishes prepared of flour, &c., so that it 
may gradually become accustomed to 
eveiy kind of strong and wholesome 
food. 

1056. WE OUGHT, however, to bo 
cautious, and not upon any account to 
allow a child pastry, confectionery- 
cheese, heavy dishes made of boiled ur 
baked flours, onions, horse-radish. IBU* 



166 



TO DAY, HIS BEAUTEOUS VISAGE WE EXTOL J 



tard, smoked and salted meat, especi- 
ally pork, and all compound dishes ; 
for the most simple food is the most 
salubrious. 

1057. POTATOES should be allowed 
only in moderation, and not to be eaten 
with butter, but rather with other veg- 
etables, either mashed up or in broth. 

1058. THE TIME OF TAKING FOOD 
is not a matter of indifference : very 
young infants make an exception ; for, 
as their consumption of vital power is 
more rapid, they may be more frequent- 
ly indulged with aliment. 

1059. IT is, however, advisable to 
accustom even them to a certain regu- 
larity, so as to allow them their victuals 
at stated periods of the day ; for it 
has been observed, that those child- 
ren which were fed indiscriminately 
through the whole day, were subject to 
debility and disease. The stomach 
should be allowed to recover its tone, 
and to colle9k the juices necessary for 
digestion, before it is supplied with a 
new portion of food. 

1060. THE following order of giving 
food to children has been found proper, 
and conducive to their health : After 
rising in the morning, suppose about six 
o'clock, a moderate portion of luke- 
warm milk, with well-baked bread, 
which should by no means be new ; at 
nine o'clock, bread with some fruit, or, 
if fruit be scarce, a small quantity of 
fresh butter : about twelve o'clock, the 
dinner, of a sufficient quantity; be- 
tween four and five o'clock, some bread 
with fruit, or, in winter, the jam of 
plums, as a substitute for fruit. 

1061. ON this occasion, children 
should be allowed to eat till they are 
satisfied, without surfeiting- themselves, 
that they may not crave for a heavy 
eupper, which disturbs their rest, and 
is productive of bad humours : lastly, 
about seven o'clock, they may be per- 
mitted a light supper, consisting either 
of milk, soup, fruit, or boiled vegeta- 
bles and the like, but neither meat nor 
mealy dishes, nor any article of food 
which produces flatulency; in short, 
they ought then to eat but little, and 



remain awake at least for one hour aftei 
it. 

1062. IT has often been contended 
that bread is hurtful to children ; but 
this applies only to new bread, or such 
as is not sufficiently baked; for in- 
stance, our rolls, muffins, and crumpets, 
than which nothing can be more hurt- 
ful and oppressive. Good wheateu 
bread is extremely proper during the 
first years of infancy ; but that made 
of rye, or a mixture of wheat and rye, 
would be more conducive to health 
after the age of childhood. 

1063. WITH RESPECT TO DRINK, 
physicians are decidedly against giving 
it to children in large quantities, and at 
irregular periods, whether it consists of 
the mother's milk, or any other equally 
mild liquor. 

1064. IT is IMPROPER and perni- 
cious to keep infants continually at the 
breast; and it would be less hurtful, 
nay even judicious, to let them cry for 
a few nights, rather than to fill them 
incessantly with milk, which readily 
turns sour on the stomach, weakens 
the digestive organs, and ultimately 
generates scrofulous affections. 

1065. IN THE LATTER PART OF THE 

FIRST YEAR, pure water may occasion 
ally be given; and if this- 1 cannot be 
procured, a light and well-fermented 
table-beer might be substituted. Those 
parents who accustom their children to 
drink water only, bestow on them a 
fortune, the value and importance of 
which will be sensibly felt through 
life. 

1066. MANY children, however, ac- 
quire a habit of drinking during their 
meals : it would be more conducive to 
digestion, if they were accustomed to 
drink only after having made a meal. 
This useful rule is too often neglected, 
though it be certain that inundations of 
the stomach, during the mastication 
and maceration of the food, not only 
vitiate digestion, but they may be at- 
tended with other bad consequences; 
as cold drink when brought in contact 
with the teeth previously heated, mav 
easily occasion cracks or cMnks ur

these useful bones, and pave the way 
for their carious dissolution. 

1067. IF WE INQUIRE into the causes, 
which produce the crying of infants, 
we find that it seldom originates from 
pain or uncomfortable sensations; for 
those who are apt to imagine that such 
causes must always operate on the 
body of an infant, are egregiously mis- 
taken ; inasmuch as they conceive that 
the physical condition, together with 
the method of expressing - sensations, 
is the same in infants and adults. 

1068. IT REQUIRES, however, no de- 
monstration that the state of the 
former is essentially different from that 
of the latter. 

1069. IN THE FIRST TEAR OF INFAN- 
CY, many expressions of the tender or- 
gans are to be considered only as ef- 
forts or manifestations of power. 

1070. WE OBSERVE, for instance, 
that a child, as soon as it is undressed 
or disencumbered from swaddling 
clothes, moves its arms and legs, and 
often makes a variety of strong exer- 
tions ; yet no reasonable person would 
suppose that such attempts arise from 
a preternatural or oppressive state of 
the little agent. 

1071. IT is, therefore, equally absurd 
to draw an unfavourable inference 
from every inarticulate cry ; because, 
in most instances, these vociferating 
sounds imply the effort which children 
necessarily make to display the strength 
of their lunge, and exercise the organs 
of respiration. 

107-2. NATURE has wisely ordained 
that by these very efforts the power 
and utility of functions so essential to 
life should be developed, and rendered 
more perfect with every inspiration. 

1073. HENCE it follows, that those 
aver-anxious parents or nurses, who con- 
tinually endeavor to prevent infants 
from crying, do them a material injury; 
for, by such imprudent management, 
their children seldom or never acquire 
a perfect form of the breast, while the 
foundation is laid in the pectoral vessels 
for obstructions, and other diseases. 

1074. INDEPENDENTLY of any par 



ticular causes, the cries of children, 
with regard to their general effects, are 
highly beneficial and necessary. 

1075. IN THE FIRST PERIOD OF 

LIFE, such exertions are the almost only 
exercise of the infant : thus the circula- 
tion of the blood, and all the other 
fluids, is rendered more uniform ; di- 
gestion, nutrition, and the growth of the 
body, are thereby promoted ; and the 
different secretions, together with the 
very important office of the skin, or in- 
sensible perspiration, are duly per- 
formed. 

1076. HENCE it is extremely im- 
proper to consider every noise of an in- 
fant as a claim upon our assistance, 
and to intrude either food or drink, 
with a view to satisfy its supposed 
wants. By such injudicious conduct, 
children readily acquire the injurious 
habit of demanding things, or nutri- 
ments, at improper times, and without 
necessity ; their digestion becomes im- 
paired ; and consequently, at this early 
age, the whole mass of the fluids is 
gradually corrupted. 

1077. IF, HOWEVER, the mother or 
nurse has no recourse to the adminis- 
tration of aliment, they at least remove 
the child from its couch, carry it about, 
frequently in the middle of the night, 
and thus expose it to repeated colds, 
which are in their effects infinitely 
more dangerous than the most violent 
cries. 

1078. WE LEARN from daily experi- 
ence, that children who have been the 
least indulged thrive much better, un- 
fold all their faculties quicker, and 
acquire more muscular strength and 
vigour of mind than those who have 
been constantly favoured, and treated 
by their parents with the most soli- 
citous attention : bodily weakness and 
mental imbecility are the usual attri- 
butes of the latter. 

1079. THE first and principal rule of 
education ought never to be forgotten; 
that man is intended to be a free and 
independent agent ; that his moral aud 
physical powers ought to be spontane- 
ously developed ; and that he should a 



168 



TO-DAY. HE HAS DELUSIVE DREAMS OF HEAVEN 



soon as possible be made acquainted 
with the nature and uses of all his fac- 
ulties, in order to attain that degree of 
perfection which is consistent with the 
structure of his organs ; and that he is 
not originally designed for what we en- 
deavor to make of him by artificial 
aid. 

1080. HENCE the greatest art in edu- 
ating children consists in continual 

vigilance over all their actions, with- 
out ever giving them an opportunity of 
discovering that they are guided and 
watched. 

1081. THERE ARE, however, instances 
in which the loud complaints of infants 
deserve our attention. 

1082. THUS, if their cries be un- 
usually violent and long continued, we 
may conclude that they are troubled 
with colic pains ; if, on such occasions, 
they move their arms and hands re- 
peatedly towards the face, painful teeth- 
ing may account for the cause ; and, if 
other morbid phenomena accompany 
their cries, or if these expressions be 
repeated at certain periods of the day, 
we ought not to slight them, but en- 
deavour to discover the proximate or 
remote causes. 

1083. INFANTS cannot sleep too long ; 
and it is a favourable symptom, when 
they enjoy a calm and long-continued 
rest, of which they should by no means 
be deprived, as this is the greatest sup- 
port granted to them by nature. 

1084. A CHILD lives, comparatively, 
much faster than an adult; its blood 
flows more rapidly; every stimulus 
operates 'more powerfully; and not 
only its constituent parts, but its vital 
resources, also, are more speedily con- 
sumed. 

1085. SLEEP promotes a more calm 
and uniform circulation of the blood ; 
it facilitates the assimilation of the nu- 
triment received, and contributes to- 
wards a more copious and regular de- 
position of alimentary matter, while the 
horizontal posture is the most favour- 
able to the growth and development of 
the child. 

1086. SLEEP ought to be in propor- 



tion to the age of the infant. After the 
age of six months, the periods of sleep 
as well as all other animal functions 
may in some degree be regulated ; yet 
even then, a child should be suffered tc 
sleep the whole night, and several hours 
both in the morning and in the after- 
noon. 

1087. MOTHERS and nurses should 
endeavour to accustom infants, from 
the time of their birth, to sleep in the 
night preferably to the day, and for 
this purpose they ought to remove all 
external impressions which may dis- 
turb their rest, suck as noise, light, C M 
but especially not to obey every call 
for taking them up, and giving food at 
improper times. 

1088. AFTER the second year of 
their age, they will not instinctively re- 
quire to sleep in the forenoon, though, 
after dinner, it may be continued to the 
third and fourth year of life, if the 
child shows a particular inclination to 
repose ; because, till that age, the full 
half of its time may safely be allotted 
to sleep. 

1089. FROM that period, however, 
it ought to be shortened for the space 
of one hour with every succeeding year; 
so that a child of seven years old may 
sleep about eight, and not exceeding 
nine hours; this proportion may be 
continued to the ag'e of adolescence, 
and even manhood. 

1090. To AWAKEN children from 
their sleep with a noise, or in an impe- 
tuous manner, is extremely injudicious 
and hurtful : nor is it proper to carry 
them from a dark room immediately 
into a glaring light, or against a daz- 
zling wall ; for the sudden impression 
of light debilitates the organs of vision, 
and lays the foundation of weak eyes, 
fram early infancy. 

1091. A BED-ROOM, or nursery, ought 
to be spacious and lofty, dry, airy, and 
not inhabited through the day. 

1092. No SERVANTS, if possible, 
should be suffered to sleep in the same 
room, and no Ihen or washed clothei 
should ever bf hung there to dry, a 
they contaminate the air in which s* 



TO-MORROW CRIES TOO LATE TO BE FORGIVEN. 



169 



considerable, a portion of infantine life 
must be spent. 

1093. THE consequences attending 
a vitiated atmosphere in such rooms, 
are various, and often fatal. 

j.094. FEATHER-BEDS should be ban- 
ished from nurseries, as they are an 
unnatural and debilitating contrivance. 

]Q95. THE windows should never be 
opened at night, but left open the whole 
day, in fine, clear weather. 

1096. LASTLY, the bedstead must not 
be placed too low on the floor ; nor is 
it proper to let children sleep on a 
couch which is made without any ele- 
vation from the ground; because the 
most mephitic and pernicious stratum 
of air in an apartment, is that within 
one or two feet from the floor, while 
the most wholesome, or atmospheric 
air, is in the middle of the room, and 
the inflammable gas ascends to the 
top. 

1097. FAMILY TOOL CHESTS. 
Much inconvenience and considerable 
expense might be saved, if it was the 
general custom to keep in every house 
certain tools for the purpose of per- 
forming at home what are called small 
jobs, instead of being always obliged to 
send for a mechanic, and pay him for 
executing little things that, in most 
cases, could be sufficiently well done 
by a man or boy belonging to the fami- 
ly, provided that the proper instruments 
were at hand. 

1098. THE cost of these articles is 
very trifling, and the advantages of hav- 
ing them always in the house are far 
beyond the expense. 

1099. FOR instance, there should be 
an axe, a hatchet, a saw (a large 
wood-saw, also, with a buck or stand, 
if wood is burned), a claw-hammer, a 
mallet, two gimlets of different sizes, 
two screw-drivers, a chisel, a small 
plane, one or two jack-knives, a pair of 
targe scissors or shears, and a carpet- 
fork or stretcher. 

] 100. ALSO an assortment of nails of 
various sizes, from large spikes down to 
small tacks, not forgetting brass-headed 
nails, some larger and some smaller. 



1 101 . SCRS ws, likewise, will be found 
very convenient, and hooks on which 
to hang things. 

1102. THE nails and screws should 
be kept in a wooden box, made with 
divisions to separate the various sorts r 
for it is very troublesome to have them 
mixed. 

1103. AND let care be taken to keep 
up the supply, lest it should run out 
unexpectedly, and the deficiency cause 
delay and inconvenience at a time when 
their use is wanted. 

1104. IT is well to have somewhere 
in the lower part of the house, a deep, 
Tight closet, appropriated entirely to 
tools and things of equal utility, for ex- 
ecuting promptly such little repairs as 
convenience may require, without the 
delay or expense of procuring an arti- 
san. This closet should have at least 
one large shelf, and that about three 
feet from the floor. 

1105. BENEATH this shelf may be a 
deep drawer, divided into two compart- 
ments. This drawer may contain cakes 
of glue, pieces of chalk, and balls of 
twine of different size and quality. 

1106. THERE may be shelves at the 
sides of the % closet for glue-pots, paste- 
pots, and brushes, pots for black, white, 
green, and red paints, cans of painting 
oil, paint-brushes, &c. 

1107. AGAINST the wall, above the 
large shelf, let the tools be suspended, 
or laid across nails or hooks of proper 
size to support them. 

1108. THIS is much better than 
keeping them in a box, where they 
may be injured by rubbing against 
each other, and the hand may be hurt 
in feeling among them to find the thing 
that is wanted. 

1109. BUT when hung up against the 
back wall of the closet, of course each 
tool can be seen at a glance. 

1110. WE have been shown an ex- 
cellent and simple contrivance for 
designating the exact places allotted to 
all these articles in a very complete 
tool closet. 

1111. ON the closet wall, directly 
under the large nails that eipport the 



170 



TO-DAY, HE LIVES IX HOPES AS LIGHT AS AIR 



tools, is drawn with a small brush dip- 
ped in black paint or ink, an outline 
representation of the tool or instru- 
ment belonging to that particular place. 

1112. FOR instance, under each saw 
is sketched the outline of that saw, un- 
der each gimlet ft sketch of that gimlet, 
under the screw-drivers are slight 
drawings of screw-drivers. 

1113. So that, w T hen bringing back 
any tool that has been taken away for 
use, the exact spot to which it belongs 
can be found in a moment; and all con- 
fusion in putting them up and finding 
them again is thus prevented. 

1114. WRAPPING paper may be piled 
on the floor under the large shelf. It 
can be bought veiy low by the ream, 
at the large paper warehouses; and 
every house should keep a supply of it 
in several varieties. 

1115. FOR instance, coarse brown 
paper for common purposes, that de- 
nominated ironmonger's paper, which 
is strong, thick, and in large sheets, is 
useful for packing heavy articles ; and 
equally so for keeping silks, ribbons, 
blondes, &c., as it preserves their 
colours. 

1116. PRINTED papers .are unfit for 
wrapping anything, as the printing ink 
rubs off on the articles enclosed in them 
and also soils the gloves of the person 
that carries the parcel. 

1117. WHEN shopping, if the person 
at the counter proceeds to wrap up 
your purchase in a newspaper (a thing 
rarely attempted in a genteel shop), 
refuse to take it in such a cover. 

1118. IT is the business of every re- 
spectable shopkeeper to provide proper 
paper for this purpose, and printed paper 
is not proper. 

1119. WASTE newspapers had best 
be used for lighting fires, and singeing 



1120. WASTE paper that has been 
written on, cut into slips, and creased 
and folded, makes very good alumettes 
or lamp-lighters. These matters may 
appear of trifling importance, but order 
and regularity are necessary to happi- 



1121. CHINA AND GLASS 
WARE. The best material for clean- 
sing either porcelain or glass-ware, is 
fullers' earth ; but it must be beaten 
into a fine powder, and carefully clear- 
ed from all rough or hard particles, 
which might endanger the polish of the 
brilliant surface. 

1122. IN cleaning porcelain it must 
also be observed that some species re- 
quire more care and attention th;ui 
others, as every person must have ob- 
served that china-ware in common 
use frequently loses some of its co- 
lours. 

1123. THE red, especially of vermil- 
lion, is the first to go, because that 
colour, together with some others, is 
laid on by the Chinese after burning. 

1124. THE modern Chinese porce- 
lain is not, indeed, so susceptible of 
this rubbing or wearing off, as vegeta- 
ble reds are now used by them instead 
of the mineral colour. 

1125. MUCH of the red now used in 
China is actually produced by the anotto 
extracted from the cuttings of scarlet 
cloth, which have long formed an ar- 
ticle of exportation to Canton. 

1126. IT ought to be taken for 
granted that all china or glass-ware is 
well tempered ; yet a little careful at- 
tention may not be misplaced, even on 
that point : for, though ornamental 
china or glass-ware are not exposed to 
the action of hot water in common do- 
mestic use, yet they may be injudici- 
ously immersed in it for the purpose of 
cleaning ; and, as articles intended solely 
for ornament may not be so highly an- 
nealed as others, without any fraudu 
lent negligence on the part of the ma- 
nufacturer, it will be proper never to 
apply water to them beyond a tepid 
temperature. 

1127. AN ingenious and simple mode 
of annealing glass has been some time 
in use by chemists. It consists in im 
mersing the vessel in cold water, gra- 
dually heated to the boiling point, and 
suffered to remain till cold, when it 
will be fit for use. Should the glass 
be exposed to a higher temperatmv 



TO-MOEROW, DIES IN ANGUISH AND DESPAIR. 



171 



than that of boiling water, it will be 
necessary to immerse it in oil. 

1128. HAVING thus guarded against 
fractures, we naturally come to the 
best modes of repairing them when 
they casually take place, for which pur- 
pose various mixtures have been pro- 
posed ; and it will here be sufficient to 
select only tkpse which excel in neat- 
ness and facility. 

1129. PERHAPS the best cement, 
both for strength and invisibility, is 
that made from mastic. The process, 
indeed, may be thought tedious ; but a 
sufficient quantity may be made at 
once to last a lifetime. To an ounce 
of mastic, add as much highly rectified 
spirits of wine as will dissolve it. Soak 
an ounce of isinglass in water until 
quite soft, then dissolve it in pure rum 
or brandy, until it forms a strong glue, 
to which add about a quarter of an 
ounce of gum ammoniac, well rubbed 
and mixed. Put the two mixtures to- 
gether in an earthen vessel over a gentle 
heat ; when well united, the mixture 
may be put into a phial and kept well 



130. WHEN wanted for use, the 
bottle must be set in warm water, 
when the china or glass articles must 
be also warmed, and tie cement ap- 
plied. 

1131. IT will be proper that the 
broken surfaces, when carefully fitted, 
shall be kept in close contact for twelve 
hours at least, until the cement is fully 
set ; after which the fracture will be 
found as secure as any part of the ves- 
sel, and scarcely perceptible. It may 
be applied successfully to marbles, and 
even to metals. 

ll&J. WHEN not provided with this 
cement, and in a hurry, the white of an 
egg, well beaten with quicklime and a 
email quantity of very old cheese, form 
an excellent substitute, either for 
broken china, or old ornamental glass- 
ware. 

1133. IT is also a fact well ascer- 
tained, that the expressed juice of gar 
lie is an everlasting cement, leaving no 
laark of fracture, if neatly done. 
8 



1134. THESE are fully sufficient for 
every useful purpose but we may still 
further observe, in respect to the ce- 
ment of quicklime, that it may be im 
proved, if, instead of cheese, we substi- 
tute the whey produced by boiling- milk 
and vinegar, separating the curd care- 
fully, and beating up with half a pint 
of it, the whites of six eggs, adding the 
sifted quicklime until it forms a thick 
paste, which resists both fire and water 
(See 139, 72, and 254.) 

1135. ECONOMY OF FUEL. 
There is no part of domestic economy 
which everybody professes to under- 
stand better than the management ot 
a fire, and yet there is no branch in the 
household arrangement where there is 
a greater proportional and unnecessary 
waste, than arises from ignorance and 
mismanagement in this article. 

1136. IT is an old adage that we 
must stir no man's fire until we havo 
known him seven years ; but we might 
find it equally prudent if we were care- 
ful as to the stirring of our own. 

1137. ANYBODY, indeed, can take up 
a poker and toss the coals about : but 
that is not stirring a fire ! 

1138. IN short, the use of a poker 
applies solely to two particular points 
the opening of a dying fire, so as to 
admit the free passage of the air into 
it, and sometimes, but not always, 
through it or else approximating the 
remains of a half-burned fire, so as to 
concentrate the heat, whilst the parts 
still ignited are opened to the atmos- 
phere. 

1139. THE same observation may ap- 
ply to the use of a pair of bellows, the 
mere blowing of which, at random, nine 
times out of ten will fail ; the force of 
the current of air sometimes blowing 
out the fire, as it is called, that is, car- 
rying off the caloric too rapidly, and at 
others, directing the wanned current 
Vom the unignited fuel, instead of into 
t. 

1140. To prove this, let any person 
sit down with a pair of bellows, to a 
Ire only partially ignited, cr partially 
extinguished; let him blow, at first, no* 



172 



WHEN ANGRY, COUNT TEX BKFORE YOU SPEAK ; 



into the burning part, but into the 
dead coal close to it, BO that the air 
may partly extend to the burning coal. 
1141. AFTER a few blasts, let the 
bellows blow into the burning fuel, but 
directing the stream partly towards the 
dead coal; when it will be found that 
the ignition will extend much more ra- 
pidly than under the common method 
of blowing furiously into the flame at 
random. 

1142. IF the consumer, instead of 
ordering a large supply of coal at once, 
will at first content himself with a 
sample, he may with very little trouble 
ascertain who will deal fairly with him ; 
and, if he wisely pays ready money, he 
will be independent of his coal mer- 
chant ; a situation which few families, 
even in genteel life, can boast of. 

1143. INDEED, we cannot too often 
repeat the truth, that to deal for ready 
money only, in all the departments of 
domestic arrangement, is the truest 
economy. 

1144. READY money will always com- 
mand the best and cheapest of every 
article of consumption, if expended 
with judgment; and the dealer, who 
intends to act fairly, will always pre- 
fer it. 

1145. TRUST not him who seems 
more anxious to give credit than to 
receive cash. 

1146. THE former hopes to secure 
custom by having a hold upon you in 
his books; and continues always to 
make up for his advance, either by an 
advanced price, or an inferior article; 
whilst the latter knows that your cus- 
tom can only be secured by fair deal- 
ing. 

1147. THERE is, likewise, another 
consideration, as far as economy is con- 
cerned, which is, not only to buy with 
ready money, but to buy at proper sea- 
sons; for there is with every article a 
cheap season and a dear one ; and with 
none more than coate: insomuch that 
the master of a family who fills his coal 
cellar in the middle of the summer, 
rather than the beginning of the winter. ' 
will find it tilled at less expense than it [ 



would otherwise cost him : and wiil ba 
enabled to see December's snows falling 
without feeling his enjoyment of his 
fireside lessened by the consideration 
that the cheerful blaze is supplied at 
twice the rate that it need have done, 
if he had exercised more foresight. 

1 148. WE must now call to the re- 
collection of our readers that chimneyi 
often smoke, and that coal is often 
wasted by throwing too much fuel at 
once upon a fire. 

1149. To pitovE this observation, it 
is only necessary to remove the super- 
fluous coal from the top of the grate, 
when the smoking instantly ceases ; as 
to the waste, that evidently proceeds 
from the frequent, intemperate and 
injudicious use of the poker, which 
not only throws a great portion of the 
small coals among the cinders, but 
often extinguishes the fire it was in- 
tended to foster. 

1150. HEALTH IN YOUTH. 
Late hours, irregular habits, and want 
of attention to diet, are common errors 
with most young men, and these 
gradually, but at first imperceptibly, 
undermine the health, and lay the 
foundation for various forms of disease 
in after life. It is a very difficult thing 
to make young persons comprehend 
this. They frequently sit up as late as 
twelve, one, or two o'clock, without 
experiencing any ill effects; they go 
without a meal to-day, and to-morrow 
eat to repletion, with only temporary 
inconvenience. One night they will 
sleep three or four hours, and the next 
nine or ten; or one night, in their 
eagerness to get away into some agree- 
able company, they will take no food at 
all ; and the next, perhaps, will eat a 
hearty supper, and go to bed upon it. 
These, with various other irregularities, 
are common to the majority of young 
men, and are, as just stated, the cause 
of much bad health in mature life. 
Indeed, nearly all the shattered consti- 
tutions with which too many are cursed, 
are the result of a disregard to the 
plainest precepts of health in early 
life. 



IF VERY ANGRY, A HUNDRED.

1151. A WIFE'S POWER. The 
power of a wife for good or evil, is 
irresistible. Home must be the seat 
of happiness, or it must be for ever 
unknown. A good wife is to a man, 
wisdom, and courage, and strength, and 
endurance. A bad one is confusion, 
weakness, discomfiture, and despair. 
No condition is hopeless where the 
wife possesses firmness, decision, and 
economy. There is no outward pros- 
perity which can counteract indolence, 
extravagance, and folly at home. No 
spirit can long endure bad domestic 
influence. Man is strong, but his heart 
is not adamant. He delights in enter- 
prise and action; but to sustain him 
he needs a tranquil mind, and a whole 
heart. He needs his moral force in 
the conflicts of the world. To recover 
his equanimity and composure, home 
must be to him a place of repose, of 
peace, of cheerfulness, of comfort ; and 
his soul renews its strength again, and 
goes forth with fresh vigour to en- 
counter the labour and troubles of life. 
But if at home he finds no rest, and is 
there met with bad temper, sullenness, 
or gloom, or is assailed by discontent 
or complaint, hope vanishes, and he 
sinks into despair. % 

1152. ADVICE TO WIVES. A 
wife must learn how to form her hus- 
band's happiness, in what direction the 
secret lies; she must not cherish his 
weaknesses by working upon them; 
she must not rashly run counter to 
his prejudices ; her motto must be, 
never to irritate. She must study 
never to draw largely on the small 
stock of patience in a man's nature, nor 
to increase his obstinacy by trying to 
drive him ; never, never, if possible, to 
have scenes. We doubt much if a real 
quarrel, even made up, does not loosen 
the bond between man and wife, and 
sometimes, unless the affection of both 
be very sincere, lastingly. If irritation 
should occur, a woman must expect to 
hear from most men a strength and 
vehemence of language far more than 
the occasion requires. Mild, as well as 
stern men, are prone to this exaggera- 



tion of language ; let not a woman bo 
tempted to say anything sarcastic or 
violent in retaliation. The bitterest 
repentance must needs follow if she do. 
Men frequently forget what they h,?e 
said, but seldom what is uttered by 
their wives. They are grateful, too, 
for forbearance in such cases; for, 
whilst asserting most loudly that they 
are right, they are often conscious that 
they are wrong. Give a little time, as 
the greatest boon you can bestow, to 
the irritated feelings of your husband. 

1153. COUNSELS FOR THE 
YOUNG. Never be cast down by 
trifles. If a spider break his thread 
twenty times, twenty times will he 
mend it again. Make up your minds 
to do a thing and you will do it. Fear 
not if a trouble comes upon you; keep 
up your spirits, though the day be a 
dark one. If the sun is going down, 
look up to the stars. If the earth is 
dark, keep your eye on Heaven ! With 
God's promises, a man or a child may 
be cheerful. Mind what you run after ! 
Never be content with a bubble that 
will burst, firewood that will end in 
smoke and darkness. Get that which 
you can keep, and which is worth keep- 
ing. Fight hard against a hasty temper 
Anger will come, but resist it strongly. 
A fit of passion may give you cause to 
mourn all the days of your life. Never 
revenge an injury. If you have an 
enemy, act kindly to him and make 
him your friend. You may not win 
him over at onoe, but try again. 
Let one kindness be followed by an- 
other, till you have compassed your 
end. By little and little, great things 
are completed ; and repeated kindness 
will soften the heart of stone. What- 
ever you do, do it willingly. A boy 
that is whipped to school never learna 
his lessons well. A man who is com- 
pelled to work cares not how badly it 
is performed. He that pulls off his 
coat cheerfully, strips up his sleeves ii: 
earnest, and sings while he works, ife 
the man of action. 

1154. SALLY LUNN T EA CAKES. 
Take one pint of milk quite warm, a

quarter of a pint of thick, small-beer 
yeast: put them into a pan with flour 
sufficient to make it as thick as batter, 
cover it over, and let it stand till it has 
risen as high as it will, i.e., about two 
hours: add two ounces of lump sugar, 
dissolved in a quarter of a pint of warm 
milk, a quarter of a pound of butter 
rubbed into your flour very fine, then 
make your dough the same as for French 
rolls, &e. ; let it stand half an hour : 
then make up your cakes, and put them 
on tins : when they have stood to rise, 
bake them in a quick oven. Care should 
be taken never to put your yeast to 
water or milk too hot, or too cold, as 
either extreme will destroy the fermen- 
tation. IB summer it should be luke- 
warm, in winter a little warmer, and 
in very cold weather, warmer still. 
When it has first risen, if you are not 
prepared, it will not hurt to stand an 
hour. 

1155. FRENCH BREAD AND 
ROLLS. Take a pint and a half of 
milk ; make it quite warm ; half a pint 
of small-beer yeast ; add sufficient 
flour to make it as thick as batter ; put 
it into a pan ; cover it over, and keep 
it warm ; w y hen it has risen as high as 
it will, add a quarter of a pint of warm 
water, and half an ounce of salt, mix 
them well together, rub into a little 
flour two ounces of butter ; then make 
your dough, not quite so stiff as for 
your bread ; let it stand for three quar- 
ters of an hour, and it will be ready to 
make into rolls, &c. : let them stand 
till they have risen, and bake them in a 
quick oven-. 

1156. RULES FOR THE PRE- 
SERVATION OF HEALTH. 

1157. PUBE atmospheric air is com- 
posed of nitrogen, oxygen, and a very 
small proportion of carbonic acid gas. 
Air once breathed has lost the chief 
part of its oxygen, and acquired a 
proportionate increase of carbonic acid 
gas. 

1158. Therefore, health requires that 
w r e breathe the same air once only. 

1159. THE solid part of our bodies 



are continually wasting, and requirei 
to be repaired by fresh substances. 

1160. Therefore, food, which is to re- 
pair the loss, should be taken with duo 
regard to the exercise and waste of the 
body. 

1161. THE fluid part of our bodies 
also wastes constantly; there is but 
one fluid in animals, which is water. 

1162. Therefore, water only is neces- 
sary, and no artifice can produce a 
better drink. 

1163. THE fluid of our bodies is to 
the solid in proportion as nine to one. 

1164. Therefore, a like proportion 
should prevail in the total amount of 
food taken. 

1165. LIGHT exercises an important 
influence upon the growth and vigour 
of animals and plants. 

1166. Therefore, our dwellings should 
freely admit the solar rays. 

1167. DECOMPOSING animal and veg- 
etable substances yield various noxious 
gases, which enter the lungs and cor- 
rupt the blood. 

1168. Therefore, all impurities should 
be kept away from our abodes, and 
every precaution be observed to secure 
a pure atmosphere. 

1169.*VARMTH is essential to all the 
bodily functions. 

1170. Therefore, an equal bodily tem- 
perature should be maintained by exer- 
cise, by clothing, or by fire. 

1171. EXERCISE warms, invigorates, 
and purifies the body; clothing pre- 
serves the warmth the body generates; 
fire imparts warmth externally. 

1172. Therefore, to obtain and pre- 
serve warmth, exercise and clothing are 
preferable to fire. 

1173. FIRE consumes the oxygen of 
the air, and produces noxious gases. 

1174. Therefore, the air is less pure 
in the presence of candles, gas, or coal 
fire, than otherwise, and the deteriora- 
tion should be repaired by increased 
ventilation. 

1175. THE skin is a highly-organized 
membrane, full of minute pores, cells, 
blood-vessels, and nerves; it imbibes 
moisture or throws it off, according to 



THE POOR MAN FASTS BECAUSE HE HAS NO MEAT | 



175 



the state of tho atmosphere and the 
temperature of the body. It also 
" breathes," as do the lungs (though 
less actively). All the internal organs 
sympathise with the skin. 

1 176. Therefore, it should be repeat- 
edly cleansed. 

1177. LATE hours and anxious pur- 
suits exhaust the nervous system, and 
produce disease and premature death. 

1178. Therefore, the hours of labour 
and study should be short. 

1179. MENTAL and bodily exercise are 
equally essential to the general health 
and happiness. 

1130. Therefore, labour and study 
should succeed each other. 

1181. MAN will live most healthily 
upon simple solids and fluids, of which 
a sufficient but temperate quantity 
should be taken. 

1182. Therefore, strong drinks, tobac- 
co, snuff, opium, and all mere indulgen- 
ces should be avoided. 

1183. SUDDEN alternations of heat and 
cold are dangerous (especially to the 
young and the aged). 

1184. Therefore, clothing, in quantity 
and quality, should be adapted to the 
alterations of night and day, and of the 
seasons. 

1185. And, therefore, also, drinking 
cold water when the body is hot, and 
hot tea and soups when cold, are pro- 
ductive of many evils. 

1186. MODERATION in eating and 
drinking, short hours of labour and 
study, regularity in exercise, recrea- 
tion, and rest, cleanliness, equanimity 
of temper and equality of temperature, 
these are the great essentials to that 
which surpasses all wealth, health of 
mind and body. 

1187. USE OF LIME- WATER IN 
MAKING BREAD. It has lately 
been found that water saturated with 
lime produces in bread the same white- 
ness, softness and capacity of retaining 
moisture, as results from the use of 
alum; while the former removes all 
acidity from the dcugh, and supplies an 
ingredient needed in the structure of 
the bones tut which is defir.entin the 



cerealia. The best proportion to use is, 
five pounds of water saturated with 
lime, to every nineteen pounds of flour. 
No change is required in the process of 
baking. The lime most effectually 
coagulates the gluten, and the bread 
weighs well ; bakers must therefore 
approve of its introduction, which is not 
injurious to the system, like alum, &c. 
1188. SPECIAL RULES FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF CHOLERA. 

1189. WE urge the necessity, in all 
cases of cholera, of an instant recourse 
to medical aid, and also under every 
form and variety of indisposition : for 
all disorders are found to merge in the 
dominant disease. 

1190. LET immediate relief be sought 
under disorder of the bowels especially, 
however slight. The invasion of chol- 
era may thus be readily prevented. 

1191. LET every impurity, animal 
and vegetable, be quickly removed to 
a distance from the habitations, such as 
slaughter-houses pig-sties, cesspools, 
necessaries, and all other domestic 
nuisances. 

1192. LET all uncovered drains be 
carefully and frequently cleansed. 

1193. LET the grounds in and around 
the habitations be drained, BO as 
effectually to carry off moisture of 
every kind. 

1194. LET all partitions be re- 
moved from within and without habi- 
tations, which unnecessarily impede 
ventilation. 

1195. LET every room be daily 
thrown open for the admission of fresh 
air; this should be done about noon, 
when the atmosphere is most likely to 
be dry. 

1196. LET dry scrubbing be used in 
domestic cleansing in place of water 
cleansing. 

1197. LET excessive fatigue, and 
exposure to damp and cold, especially 
during the night be avoided 

1198. LET the use of cold drinks and 
acid liquors, especially under fatigue, 
be avoided, or when tho body is heated. 

1199. LET the use of cold acid 
fruits and vegetables be avoided. 



176 



THE RICH MAN FASTS BECAUSE HE WILL NOT EAT. 



1200. LET excess in the use of ar- 
dent an 1 fere lented liquors and tobac- 
co be avoided. 

1201. LET a poor diet, and the use 
of impure water in cooking, or for 
drinking, be avoided. 

1202. LET the wearing of wet and 
insufficient clothes be avoided. 

1203. LET a flannel or woollen 'belt 
be worn round the belly. 

1204. LET personal cleanliness be 
carefully observed. 

1205. LET every ca:se tending to 
depress the moral anc physical ener- 
gies be carefully avoided. Let expo- 
sure to extremes of heat and cold be 
avoided. 

1206. LET crowding- of persons with- 
in houses and apartments be avoided. 

1207. LET sleeping in low o* iamp 
rooms be avoided. 

1208. LET fires be kept u t uuring 
the night in sleeping or adjoining apart- 
ments, the night being the period of 
most danger from attack, especially 
under exposure to cold or damp. 

1209. LET all bedding and clothing 
be daily exposed during winter and 
spring to the fire, and in summer to 
the heat of the sun. 

1210. LET the dead be buried in 
places remote from the habitation of 
the living. By the timely adoption of 
simple means such as these, cholera or 
other epidemic will be made to lose its 
venom. 

1211. ETIQUETTE OF THE 
NEWLY MARRIED. A newly mar- 
ried couple send out cards immediately 
after the - ceremony, to their friends 
and acquaintance, who, on their part, 
return either notes or cards of congrat 
ulaticn on the event. As soon as the 
lady is settled in her new home, she 
may expect the calls of her acquaint- 
ance ; for which it is not absolutely 
necessary to remain at home, although 
politeness requires that they should be 
returned as soon as possible. But, 
having performed this, any further in- 
tercourse may be avoided (where it is 
deemed necessary ) by a police refusa 
of invitations. Where card are to be 



eft, the number must be determined 
according to the various members of 
which the family called upon is com- 
posed. For instance, where there are 
;he mother, aunt, and daughters (tht 
atter having been introduced to so- 
ciety ), three cards should be left. See 
2865. 

1212 DISEASES. 

For the proper Remedies and their Doses ace 
"Prescriptions," 1273. 

1213. IT should be clearly under- 
stood, that in all cases of disease, the 
advice of a skilful physician is of the 
first importance. It is not, therefore, 
ntended by the following information 

to supersede the important and neces- 
sary practice of the medical man ; but 
rather, by exhibiting the treatment re- 
quired, to show in what degree his aid 
is imperative. In cases, however, 
where the disorder may be simple and 
transient, or in which remote residence, 
or other circumstance may deny the 
privilege of medical attendance, the 
following particulars will be found of 
the utmost value. Moreover, the hints 
given upon what should be AVOIDED 
will be of great service to the patient 
since the physiological is no less im- 
portant than the medical treatment of 
disease.

1296. DR. SCOTT'S WASH TO WHITEN 
THE NAILS. Diluted sulphuric acid, 
two drams ; tincture of myrrh, one 
dr.im ; spring water, four ounces. Mix. 
First cleanse with white soap, and then

1297. CURE FOR CORNS. Take two 
ounces of gum-ammoniac, two ounces 
of yellow wax and six drachms of ver- 
digris, melt them together, and spread 
the composition on soft leather. Cut 
away as much of the corn as you can, 
then apply the plaster, and renew it 
every fortnight till the corn is away. 

1298. DEAFNESS FROM DEFICIENT SE- 
CRETION OF WAX. Take oil of turpen- 
pentine, half a drachm ; olive oil, two 
drachms. Mix. Two drops to be in 
troduced into the ear at bed-time. 

1299. To RENOVATE BLACK CRAPE. 
Skim-milk and water, with a little 
bit of glue in it, made scalding hot, will 
restore old rusty black Italian crape. If 
clapped and pulled dry, like fine mus 
lin, it will look as good as new. 

1300. SCOURING DROPS FOR REMOV- 
ING SPOTS, GREASE, &c., FROM LINEN 

OR ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE. Take

1301. To CLEAN MARBLE. Take t\c 



184 



UNCERTAINTY WALKS ON BOTH SIDES OF US. 



parts of common sxla, one part of pu- 
mice-stone, and one part of finely pow- 
dered chalk ; sift it through a fine sieve, 
and mix it with water ; then rub it well 
all over the marble, and the stains will 
DC removed ; then wash the inarble 
over with soap and water, and it will 
be as clean as it was at first. 

1302. PAINT. To get rid of the 
mell of oil paint plunge a handful of 
ay into a pailfull of water, and let it 
tand in the room newly painted. 

1303. AN EXCELLENT JELLY. (FOR 
THE SICK ROOM.) TaTte rice, sago, 
pearl-barley, hartshorn shavings, each 
one ounce ; simmer with three pints of 
water to one, and strain it. When cold 
it will be a jelly, of which give, dis- 
solved in wine, milk, or broth, in change 
with the other nourishment. 

1304. IMPRESSIONS FROM COINS. 
Melt a little isinglass glue with brandy, 
and pour it thinly over the medal, &c., 
so as to cover its whole surface ; let it 
remain on for a day or two, till it has 
thoroughly dried and hardened, and then 
take it oft', when it will be fine, clear, 
and as hard as a piece of Muscovy glass, 
and will have a very elegant impression 
of the coin. It will also resist the ef- 
fects of damp air, which occasions all 
other kinds of glue to soften and bend 
If not prepared in this way. 

]3U5. TRAP FOE SNAILS. Snails are 
particularly fond of bran ; if a little is 
spread on the ground, and covered ovei 
with a few cabbage leaves or tiles, they 
will congregate under them in greal 
numbers, and by examining them every 
morning, and destroying them, their 
numbers will be materially decreased. 

1306. To DESTROY SLUGS. Slugs 
are very voracious, and their ravages of- 
ten do considerable damage, not only to 
the kitchen garden, but to the flower- 
beds also. If, now and then, a few 
slices of turnip be put about the beds, 
on a summer or autumnal evening, the 
slugs will congregate thereon, and may 
be destroyed. 

1307. T KEEP MOTHS, BEETLES, &c., 
FROM THE CLOTHES.-^Put a piece of 
eanrohor i a line \ ong, or some aroma- 



5c herbs, in the drawers, among linen 
>r woollen clothes, and neither moth nor 
worm will come near them. 

1308. To CLEAR ROSE TREES FROM 
SLIGHT. Take sulphur and tobacco 
dust in equal quantities, and strew it 
over the trees of a morning when the 
dew is on them. The insects will dis- 
appear in a few days. The trees should 

hen be syringed with a decoct' on of 
;lder leaves. 

1309. To PREVENT MILDEW ON ALL 
SORTS OF TREES. The best preventive 
against mildew is to keep the plant pub- 

ect to it occasionally syringed with a 
decoction of elder leaves, which will 
prevent the fungus growing on them. 

1310. To DETECT COPPER IN PICK- 



LES OR 



TEA. Put a few leaves 



of the tea, or some of the pickle, cut 
small, into a phial with two or three 
drachms of liquid ammonia, diluted 
with one-half the quantity of water. 
Shake the phial, when, if the most 
minute portion of copper be present, the 
liquid will assume a fine blue colour. 

1311. OFFENSIVE BREATH. For 
this purpose, almost the only substance 
that should be admitted at the toilette 
is the concentrated solution of chloride 
of soda. From six to ten drops of it in 
a wine glass full of pure spring water, 
taken immediately after the operations 
of the morning are completed. 

1312. IN some cases, the odour aris- 



ing from carious teeth 
with that of the stomach. 



is combined 
If the mouth 



be well rinsed with a teaspoonful of the 
solution of the chloride in a tumbler ol 
water, the bad odour of the teeth will 
be removed. 

1313. To PROTECT DAHLIAS .FROM 
EARWIGS. Dip a piece of wool or cot- 
ton in oil, and slightly tie it round the 
stalk, about a foot from the earth. The 
stakes which you will put into the 
ground to support your plants must also 
be surrounded by the oiled cotton or 
wool, or the insects will climb up them 
to the blossoms and tender tops of the 
stems. 

1314. To FREE PLANTS FROM LEAF- 
LICE. M. Braun, of Vienna, give* thi 



PERSE1 ERANCE OVERCOMES DIFFICULTIES. 



185 



followirg as a cheap and easy mode of 
effecting it : Mix one ounce of flowers 
of sulphur with one bushel of sawdust ; 
scatter this over the plants infected 
with these insects, and they will soon 
be freed, though a second application 
may possibly be necessary. 

1315. TREATMENT OF WARTS. Pare 
the hard and dried skin from their tops, 
and then touch them with the smallest 
drop of strong acetic acid, taking care 
that the acid does not run off the wart 
upon the neighbouring skin, for if it do, 
it will occasion inflammation and much 
pain, if this practice be continued 
once or twice daily, with regularity, 
paring the surface of the wart occasion- 
ally, when it gets hard and dry, the 
wart may be soon effectually cured. 

1316. To FATTEN FOWLS IN A SHORT 
TIME. Mix together ground rice well 
scalded with milk, and add some coarse 
sugar. Feed therewith this in the day- 
time, but not too much at once : let it 
be pretty thick. 

1317. To DISCOVER WHETHER BREAD 
is ADULTERATED WITH ALUM. The 
bread must be soaked in water, and to 
the water in which it has been soaked, 
a little of the solution of muriate of lime 
must be added, upon which, if any alum 
be present, the liquid will be pervaded 
with milkiness ; but if the bread be 
pure the liquid will remain limpid. Ra- 
tionale : sulphuric acid has a stronger 
affinity for lime than for the alumina 
and potass, with which it forms alum ; 
it therefore quits those bodies to form 
sulphate of lime with the lime of the 
test, which produces the milkiness. 

1318. To MAKE IMPRESSIONS OF 
LEAVES UPON SILKS, SATIN, PAPER, OR 
ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE. Prepare two 
rubbers of wash-leather, made by tying 
up wool or any other substance in 
wash-leather; then prepare the colours 
which you wish the leaves to be, by 
rubbing up with cold-drawn linseed oil 
the colours you want, as indigo for blue, 
chrome for yellow, indigo and chrome 
for green, &c. ; get a number of leaves 
the size and kind you wish to stamp, 
then dip the rubbers into the paint, 



and rub them one over the other, so 
that you may have but s. small quanti- 
ty of the composition upon the rubbers; 
place a leaf upon one rubber and moist- 
en it gently with the other ; take the 
leaf off, and apply it to the sub- 
stance you wish stamped ; upon the 
leaf place a piece of white paper, press 
gently, and there will be a beautiful 
impression of all' the veins of the leaf. 
It will be as well if only one leaf be 
used one time. The leaves picked 
should be of one size, as otherwise the 
work will not look uniform. 

1319. To EXTERMINATE BEETLES. 
1. Place a few lumps of unslacked 
lime where they frequent. 2. Set a 
dish or trap containing a little beer or 
syrup at the bottom, and place a few 
sticks slanting against its sides, so as to 
form a sort of gangway for the beetles 
to climb up by, when they will go head- 
long into the bait set for them. 3. Mix 
equal weights of red lead, sugar, flour, 
and place it nightly near their haunts. 
This mixture made into sheets, form the 
beetle wafers sold at the oil shops. 

1320. To CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. 
As hot water and soap very soon soften 
the hairs, and rubbing completes their 
destruction, use soda, dissolved in cold 
water, instead ; soda having an affinity 
for grease, it cleans the brush with lit- 
tle friction. Do not set them near the 
fire, nor in the sun, to dry, but after 
shaking them well, set them on the 
point of the handle in a shady place. 

1321. To CLEAN FRENCH Km 
GLOVES. Put the gloves on your hand 
and wash them, as if you were wash- 
ing your hands, in some spirits of tur- 
pentine, until quite clean ; then hang 
them up in a warm place, or where 
there is a current of air, and all smell 
of the turpentine will be removed. 
This method is practiced in Paris, and 
since its introduction into this country, 
thousands of dollars have been gained 
by it. 

1322. EASY METHOD OF BREAKING 
GLASS TO ANY REQUIRED FIGURE. 
Make a small notch by means of a tile 
on the edge of a piece of glass, tne

DESPERATE CUTS MUST HAVE DESPERATE CURES. 



make the end of a tobacco-pipe, or of a 
rod of iron of the same size, red hot in 
the fire, apply the hot iron to the notch, 
and draw it slowly along the surface of 
the glass in any direction you please, a 
crack will follow the direction of the 
ir^n. 

*1323. ERRORS IN SPEAKING. 
(see 29G5. ) There are several kinds 
of errors in speaking. The most ob 
ectionable of them are those in which 
Word* are employed that are unsuitable 
to convey the meaning intended. Thus, 
a person wishing to express his inten- 
tion of going to a given place, says, " I 
propose going," when, in fact, he pur- 
poses going. An amusing illustration of 
this class of error was overheard by 
ourselves. A venerable matron was 
speaking of her son, who, she said, was 
quite stage-struck. " In fact," remark- 
ed the old lady, " he is going to a prema- 
ture performance this evening !" Con- 
sidering that must amateur perform- 
ances are premature, we hesitate to say 
that this word was misapplied ; though, 
evidently, the maternal intention was 
to convey quite another meaning. 

1324. OTHER errors arise from the 
substitution of sounds similar to the 
words which should be employed. 
That is, spurious words instead of gen- 
uine ones. Thus, some people say ' re- 
numerativc,' ' when they mean "remu- 
nerative." A nurse, recommending 
her mistress to have one of the newly- 
invented carriages for her child, advised 
her to purchase a preamputator ! 

1325. OTHER errors are occasioned 
by imperfect knowledge of the English 
grammar. Thus many people say, 
" Between you and 7," instead of " Be- 
tween you and me." By the misuse of 
the adjective: " What beautiful butter,'' 
" What a nice landscape." They should 
say, " What a beautiful landscape" 
" What nice butter." And by numerous 
other departures from the rules of 
grammar which will be pointed out 
hereafter. 

* See a work published by Dick k Fitz- 
gerald. New York, entitled " Live and Learn, 
at 1000 Mistakes Corrected." 



1326. BY the mispronunciation of 
words. Many persons say pronouncia- 
tion instead of pronunciation : other* 
say pro-nun'-she-a-shun, instead of pro- 
nun-ce-a-shun. 

1327. By the niisdivision of words 
and syllables. This defect makes the 
words an ambassador sound like a 
nam-bassador, or an adder like a nadder 

1328. BY imperfect enunciation, as 
when a person says hebben for heaven, 
ebber for ever,jocholate for chocolate, a 
hedge, a ncdge, or an edge, a hedge. 

1329. IN affirmative sentences, shall 
in the first person, simply foretells ; as 
" I shall write." 

1 330. IN the second and third persons, 
shall is used potentially, denoting a 
promise, command, OT determination; as, 
' You shall be rewarded ;" "Thou shall 
not kill;" " He shall be punished." 

1331. Will, in the first person, is 
used potentially, denoting promise or 
determination ; as, " I will go at all 
hazards." In the second and third per- 
sons, will simply foretells ; as, " You 
icill soon be there ;" " He will expect 
your." 

1332. IN interrogative sentences, 
shall, in the first person, may either be 
used potentially to inquire the will of 
the person addressed, as, " Shall I bring 
you another book ?" or it may simply 
ask whether a certain event will occur ; 
as, " Shall I arrive in time for the 
train?" 

1333. .When shall is used interroga- 
tively in the second person, it simply 
denotes futurity ; as, " Shall you be in 
New York next week ?" 

1334. Shall, employed interrogative- 
ly in the third person, has a potential 
signification, and is used to inquire the 
will of the person addressed ; as, " Shall 
John order the carriage ?" 

1335. Will, used interrogatively in 
the second person, is potential in it 
signification; as, " Will you go?" 

1336. Will may be used interroga- 
tively in the third person, to denote 
mere futurity ; as, " Will the boat "leave 
to-day?" Or it may have a potential 

j signification, inquiring the wifl of tn 



FAIR AND SOFTLY GO SURE AND FAR. 



187 



person spoken of; as, " Will he hazard 
his life for the safety of his friend?" 

1337. IN the subjunctive mood, shall. 
in all the persons, denotes mere futurity ; 
as, " If thy brother shall trespass against 
thee, go and tell him his fault." 

1338. Will, on the contrary, is po- 
tential in its signification, ha-ing re- 
spect to the will of the agent or sub- 
ject ; as, " If he will strive to improve, 
IK shall be duly rewarded." 

,.339. THE following expressions are 
Dy some persons considered objection- 
able : they are, however, so far sanc- 
tioned by custom, that any deviation 
from them would be looked on as pe- 
dantic : 

1340. He lives opposite the church; 
the very best ; the very worst ; he need 
not go ; she dare not come ; this house to 
let ; he could neither read nor write ; they 
were bred and born in New York. 

1341. SOME would have us say, oppo- 
site to, c., the best and the worst, leav- 
ing out very ; he needs not, &c. ; she 
dares not, &c. 

1342. Tobe let ; neither icrite nor read; 
born and bred,&c. 

1343. PERSONS bred in Ireland and 
Scotland retain more or less of their 
provincialisms; and, therefore, when 
they move into other 'districts they be- 
come conspicuous for the peculiarities 
of their speaking. In mnny cases they 
appear vulgar and uneducated, when 
they are not so. It is, therefore very 
desirable for all persons to approach the 
recognized standard of correctness as 
nea-rly as possible. 

1344. To correct these errors by a 
systematic course of study, would in- 
volve a closer application than our read- 
ers generally could afford; and would 
require much more space than we can 
devote to the subject. We will there- 
fore give numerous rules and hints, in a 
concise and simple form, which will be 
of great assistance to Enquirers. 

1345. THESE Rules and Hints will be 
founded upon the authority of scholars, 
the usages of the bar, the pulpit, and 
the senate, and the authority of socie- 
ties ff rme^ for the purpose of collecting 



and diffusing knowledge pertaining to 
the language of this country. 

1346. Who and ichorn are used in re- 
lation to persons, and which in relation 
to things. But it was once common to 
say " the man which." This should now 
be avoided. It is now usual to say, 
" Our Father who art in Heaven," in- 
stead of " which art in Heaven." 

1347. Whose, is, however, sometimes 
applied to things as to persons. We 
may, therefore, say, " the country whose 
inhabitants are free." [Grammarians 
differ in opinion upon this subject, but 
general usage justifies the rule.] 

1348. Thou is employed in solemn 
discourse, and you in common language. 
Ye (plural) is also used in serious ad- 
dresses, and you in familiar language. 

1349. THE uses of the word It are 
various and very perplexing to the un- 
educated. It is not only used to imply 
persons, but things, and even ideas, and 
therefore, in speaking or writing, its 
assistance is constantly required. The 
perplexity respecting this word arises 
from the fact that in using it in the 
construction of a long sentence, suffi- 
cient care is not taken to ensure that 
when it is employed it really points out 
or refers to the object intended. For 
instance, " It was raining when John 
set out in his cart to go to the market, 
and he was delayed so long that it was 
over before he arrived.'' Now what ia 
to be understood by this sentence? 
Was the rain over ? or the market 1 
Either or both might be inferred frpm 
the construction of the sentence, which, 
therefore, should be written thus : " II 
was raining when John set out in his 
cart, to go to the market, and he was 
delayed so long that the market was 
over before he arrived." 

1350. Rule. After writing a sentence 
always look through it, and see that 
wherever the word It is employed, it 
refers to or carries the mind back to the 
object which it is intended to point out 

1351. THE general distinction be- 
tween This and TJiat, is, this denotes an 
object present or near, in time or place, 
that to be absent. 



188 



HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO BREAD. 



1352. These refers, in the same man 
ner, to present objects, while those re 
fers to thing that are remote. 

1853. Who changes under certain 
conditions, into whose and whom. But 
that and which always remain the same 

1354. That may be applied to nouns 
or subjects of all sorts, as, the girl that 
went to school, the dog that bit me, the 
ship that went to New Orleans, the 
opinion that he entertains. 
^ 1355. THE misuse of these pronouns 
gives rise to more errors in speaking 
and writing 1 than any other cause. 

1356. WHEN you wish to distinguish 
between two or more persons, say, 
" Which is the happy man ?" not who 
" Which of those ladies do you ad- 
mire ?" 

1357. Instead of " Ww do you think 
him to be ?" say, " whom do you think 
him to be ?" 

1358. Whom should I see ?" 

1359. To whom do you speak ?" 

1360. JFAosaidso? 

1361. Who gave it to you ?" 

1362. Of whom did you procure 
them ?" 

1363. fffcowasAe?" 

1364. Who do men say that 7am. 

1365. Whom do they represent me 
to be? 

1366. In many instances in which 
who is used as an interrogative, it does 
not become whom ; as, " WTio do you 
Bpeak to?" " Who do you expect?" 
" Who is she married to ?" " Who is this 
reserved for ?" " Who was it made by ?" 
Such sentences are found in the writ- 
ings of our best authors, and it would 
be presumptuous to consider them as 
ungrammatical. If the word whom 
should be preferred, then it would be 
best to say, " For whom is this reserv- 
ed ?" &c.' 

1367. Instead of " After which hour," 
tay, " After that hour." 

_ 1368. Self should never be added to 
his, their, mine or thine. 

1369. Each is used tc denote every 
individual of a number. 

1370. Every denotes all the individ- 
uals of a n'nubrr. 



1371. Either and or denote an alter 
native : " 1 will take either road, at youi 
pleasure;" " 1 will take this or that." 

1372. Neither means not either ; anc 
nor means not other. 

1373. Either is sometimes used for 
each. " Two thieves were crucified, on 
either side one." 

1374. "LicT each esteem others as 
good as themselves," should be, " Let 
each esteem others as good as himself. 1 

1375. " THERE are bodies each of 
which arc so small," should be, " each 
of which is so small." 

1376. Do not use double compara- 
tives, such as most straightest, most 
highest, most finest. 

1377. THE term worser has gone out 
of use ; but lesser is still retained. 

1378. The use of such words as 
chief est, extremest, &c., has become ob- 
solete, because they do not give any su- 
perior force to the meanings of the 
primary words, chief, extreme, &c. 

1379. SUCH expressions as more im- 
possible, more indispensable, more uni- 
versal, more uncontrollable, more un- 
limited, &c., are objectionable, as they 
really enfeeble the meaning which it is 
the object of the speaker or writer to 
strengthen. For instance, impossible 
gains no strength by rendering it more 

mpossible. This class of error is com- 
mon with persons who say, " A great 
J arge house," " A great big animal," 
'A little small foot," "A tiny little 
land." 

1380. Here, there, and where, origi- 
lally denoting place, may now, by 
common consent, be used to denote 
other meanings; such as, " There I 
agree with you," " llliere we differ," 

We find pain where we expected 
Measure," " Here you mistake me." 

1381. Hence, whence, and thence, de- 
noting departure, c., may be used 
without the word from. The idea of 
from is included in the word ichencc- 
herefore it is unnecessary to say 

' From whence." 

1382. Hither, thither, and whither, de- 
noting to a place, have generally been 

uperseded by here, there, and irherc 



IDLE FOLKS TAKE THE MOST PAINS. 



189 



But there is no good reason why they 
should not be employed. If, however, 
they are used, it is unnecessary to add 
the word to, because that is implied 
" H'liii/ier are you going?" " Where are 
yougoing?" Each of these sentences 
is complete. To say, " Where are you 
going to ?" is redundant. 

1383. Two negatives destroy each 
other, and produce an affirmative. 
" Nor did he not observe them," con- 
veys the idea that he did observe 
them." 

13S4. But negative assertions are 
allowable. " His manners are not un- 
polite," which implies that his manners 
are, in some degree, marked by polite- 
ness. 

1385. Instead of "I had rather 
walk," say " I would rather walk." 

1385.* Instead of " I had better go,"

go."

say "Not that I know."

Bay " Were I to do so."

same if I was him, 1 ' say " I would do 
the same if I were he." 

1398. Instead of "I had as lief go 
myself," saj- " I would as soon go my- 
elf,' 1 or " I would rather." 



1399. It is better to say " Bred and 
born," than " Born and bred." 

1400. It is better to say " Six weeks 
ago," than " Six weeks back." 

1401. It is better to say " Since 
which time," than ' Since when." 

1402. It is better to say "I repeated 
it," than "I said so over again." 

1403. It is better to say " A physi- 
cian" or " A surgeon" (according to 
his degree), than " A medical man." 

1404. Instead of " He was too young 
to have suffered much," say " He was 
too young to suffer much." 

1405. Instead of" Less friends," say 
"Fewer friends." Less refers to 
quantity.

people," say " A number of people." 

1407. Instead of " He and they we 
know," say " Him and them." 

1408. Instead of " As far as I can 
see," say " So far as I can see." 

1409. Instead of " If I am not mis- 
taken,' 1 say " If I mistake not.'' 

1410. Instead of "You are *nis- 
taken, 1 ' say " You mistake." 

1411. Instead of "What beautiful 
tea," say " What good tea." 

1412. Instead of " What a nice pros- 
pect," say " What a beautiful pros- 
pect." 

1413. Instead of "A new pair of 
gloves," say "A pair of new gloves." 

1414. Instead of saying " He belongs 
to the ship, 11 say " The ship belongs to 
him." 

1415. Instead of saying " Not no 
such thing," say "Not any such 
thing." 

1416. Instead of " I hope you'll think 
nothing on it," say " I hope you'll think 
nothing of it."

to " get over an opposition.' '

(See 1781 to 1791). 

1601. " THOU SHALT NOT TAKE 
THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD 
IN VAIN." 

1602. PRONUNCIATION. Ac- 
cent is a particular stress or force of 
the voice upon certain syllables or 
words. This mark ' in printing de- 
notes the syllable upon which the 
stress or force of the voice should be 
placed. 

1603. A WORD may have more than 
one accent. Take as an instance 
as pira'tion. In uttering this word we 
give a marked emphasis of the voice 
upon the first and third syllables, and 
therefore those syllables are said to be 
accented. The first of these accents i 
less distinguishable than the second, 
upon which we dwell longer, therefore 
the second accent is called the primary, 
or chief accent of the word. 

1604. WHEN the full accent falls on 
a vowel, that vowel should have a long 
sound, as in vo'cal ; but when it falls 
on a consonant, the preceding vowel 
has a short sound, as in habit. 

1605. To obtain a good knowledge 
of pronunciation, it is advisatle for the 
reader to listen to the examples given 



ONE STORY IS GOOD UNTIL ANOTHER IS 


TOLD. 195 


by good speakers, and by educated 


Colleague 


To colleague' 


persons. We learn the pronunciation 


Col lect 


To collect' 


of words, to a great extent, by imita- 


Com' pact 


To compact' 


tion, just as birds acquire the notes of 


Com'plot 


To complot' 


other birds which may be near them. 


Com'pound 


To compound' 


1606. BUT it will be veiy important 


Com'press 


To com press' 


to bear in mind that there are many 


Con'cert 


To concert' 


words having a double meaning or 


Con'crete 


To concrete' 


application, and that the difference of 


Con'duct 


To conduct' 


meaning is indicated by the difference 


Con'fect 


To confecf 


of the accent. Among these words, 


Con'fine 


To confine' 


Aouns are distinguished from verbs by 


Con'flict 


To conilict' 


this means: Nouns are accented on the 


Con'serve 


To conserve' 


first syllable, and verbs on the last. 


Con'sort 


To consorf 


1607. Noun signifies name; nouns 


Con'test 


To contest' 


are the names of persons and things ; 


Con'text 


To context' 


ns well as of things not material and 


Con'tract 


To contract' 


palpable, but of which we have a con- 


Con'trast

ception and knowledge, such as cour- 


Con'vert 


To convert' 


age, firmness, goodness, strength ; and 


Con'verse 


To converse' 


verbs express actions, movements, &c. 


Con'vict 


To convict' 


If the word used signifies that anything 


Con'voy 


To convoy' 


has been done, or is being done, or is, 


Des'cant 


To descanf 


or is to be done, then that word is a 


Des'ert 


To deserf 


verb. 


De'tail 


To detail' 


1G08. THUS, when we say that any- 


Di'gest 


To digest' 


thing is an " in'sult," that word is a 


Dis'cord 


To discord' 


noun, and is accented on the first syl- 


Dis'count 


To discounf 


lable ; but when we say " he did it to in- 


Es'cort 


To escort' 


sult' another person," the word insult 


Es'say 


To essay' 


implies acting, and becomes a verb, and 


Ex'ile 


To exile' 


should be accented on the last syllable. 


Ex'port 


To exporf 


The effect is, that, in speaking, you 


Ex'tract 


To extracf 


should employ a different pronunciation 


Fer'ment 


To fermenf 


in the use of the same word, when ut- 


Fore'taste

tering such sentences as these : " What 
an in'sult!" "Do you mean to insult'

1610. CEMENT' is an exception to 
the above rule, and should always be 
accented on the last syllable. So also 
the word consols'. 

1611. As a general principle, it may 
be observed that the syllables of a 
word are those divisions which are made 
in a correct pronunciation of it. 

1612. THE foil, .wing are, perhaps, the 
Dnly definite rulet that can be given on 
this subject. 

1613. Two consonants forming but 
Due sound, as ng, ch, t/i, sh, ph, wh, are 
never separated. Thus, we write 
church-cs, wor-thy,feath-er, ring-ing, a- 
ic/iilc, ocean, dan, ceous, cious, dal, tian, 
tion, tious, tinl, geon, gion,geous,gious, 
sion and s ier are seldom divided. Thus, 
we write, na-tion, o-cean, capa-cious, 
pi-geon, cap-tious. 

1614. COMPOUND words are com- 
monly separated into the simple words, 
of which they aro composed ; as, care- 
less, lee-hive, rail road. 

1615. THE termination ed, though 
not always pronounced separately, is 
regarded in writing as a distinct syllable ; 
as lov-ed, burn-cd. 

1616 DERIVATIVE and grammatical 
terminations should generally be sepa- 
rated from the radical word ; as, great- 
ly, teach-er, rusk-cst, prov-est. 

1617. RULES OF PRONUNCIA- 
TION. 

1618. C before a, o, and u, and in 
gome other situations, is a close articu- 
lation, like h. Before e i and y c is pre- 
cisely equivalent to sin same, this, as in 
ttdar, civil, .cypress, capacity 



sire, robe lyre, abate, recede, invite, 
remote, intrude. 

1620. E final indicates thate preced- 
ding has the sound of s, as in lace, 
lance ; and that g preceding has the 
sound of j, as in charge, page, chal- 
lenge. 

1621. E final in proper English 
words, never forms a syllable, and in 
most used words, in the terminating un- 
accented syllable, it is silent. Thus, mo- 
tive, genuine, examine, juvenile, reptile, 
granite, are pronounced motiv, genuin, 
examin. juvenil, reptil, granit. 

1622. E final in a few words of 
foreign origin, forms a syllable, as syn- 
cope, simile. 

1623. E final is silent after I in the 
following terminations, Me, cle, die, fie, 

, kle, pie, tie, zle ; as in able, manacle t 
cradle, ruffle, mangle, wrinkle, SU A t 
rattle, puzzle, which are pronounc 
a'bl, man'acl, cra'dl, ruffl, man'gl, 
wrinkl, sup'pl, pus'zl. 

1624. E is usually silent in the ter- 
nination en, as in token, broken ; pro- 
lounced tokn, brokn. 

1625. OUS in the termination of ad- 
ectives and their derivatives is pro- 
lounced MS, as in gracious, pi^us, pomp- 
usly. 

1626. CE, CI, TI, before a vowel 
iave the sound of sh ; as in cetaceous, 
'radons, motion, partial, ingratiate, 
renounced cetashus, grashus, moshon, 
arshal, ingrashiate. 

1627. TI, after a consonant, have the 
ound of ch, as in Christian, bastion ; 
>ronounced Chrischan, basckan. 

1628. SI, after an accented vowel, are 
renounced like zh, as in Ephesian,con- 
>tsion; pronounced Ephezian, confu- 
han. 

1629. When CI or TI precede eimi- 
ar combinations, as in pronunciation, 

ego^ation, they may be pronounced 
e, instead of she, to prevent a repetition 
f the latter syllable ; as pronuncra- 
* 'ton, instead of pronunsheashon. 

1630. GH, both in the middle and at 
the end of words ate silent; as in 



1619 E final indicates that the p re- caught, bought, fright, nigh sigh; ca/rf, 
ceding vowel is long, as in Aote, mete, \baut frite, ni, si. In the following excep- 



NEVER QUIT CERTAINTY FOR HOPE. 



197 



lions, however, GH are pronounced as 
F : cough, chough, dough, enough, 
laugh, rough, slough, tough, trough. 

1631. When WH begin a word, the 
aspirate h precedes w in pronunciation; 
as in what, whiff, whale ; pronounced 
heat, hwiff, hwale, w having precisely 
the sound of oo : French ou. In the 
following words w is silent: who 
whom, whose, whoop, whole. 

1632. II after r has no sound or use ; 
as in rheum, rhyme ; pronounced reum, 
ryme. 

1633. II should be sounded in the 
middle of words ; as in fore/tead, ab/ior, 
be/told, exhaust, in/iabit, unAorse. 

1634. H should always be sounded 
except in tho following words ; heir, 
herb, honest, honour, hospital, hostler, 
hour, humour, and humble, and all their 
derivatives ; (See 279) such as hu- 
morously, derived from humour. 

1635. K and g are silent beforen; 
as know, gnaw ; pronounced no, naw. 

1636. W before r is silent; as in 
wring, wreath ; pronounced ring, reath. 

1637. B after m is silent; as iu dumb, 
numb ; pronounrced dum, num. 

1638. L before k is silent ; as iu 
baulk, walk, talk; pronounced bauk, 
wautc, tank. (See 1663.) 

1639. PH have the sound of/; as in 
vhilosophy ; pronounced filosophy. 

1640. NG has two sounds; one as in 
singer the other ns infrn-ger. 

1641. N after m, and closing a sylla- 
ble, is silent, as in hymn, condemn. 

1642. P before s and t ip mute, as in 
psalm, pseudo, ptarmigan ; pronounced 
sam, sudo, tarmigan. 

1643. R has two sounds, one strong 
and vibrating, as at the beginning of 
words and syllables, such as robber, 
reckon, error; the other as at the ter- 
minations of words, or when it is succeed- 
ed by a consonant, as farmer, morn. 

1644. Before the letter R there is a 
slight sound of e between the vowel 
and the consonant. Thus, bare, parent, 
apparent, mere, mire, more, pure, pyre, 
are pronounced nearly baer, paercnt, ap- 
vaerent, me-er, mier moer, pucr, pyer. 
This pronunciation proceeds from the ! 



peculiar articulation of r, and it occa 

sions a slight change of the sound of a, 

which can only be learned by the ear. 
1645. There are other rules of pro- 

nunciation affecting the combinations 

of vowels, &c. ; but as they are more 

difficult to describe, and as they do 

not relate to errors which are com

selves with giving examples of them in

1647. PUNCTUATION. Punctua- 
tion teaches the method of placing 
Points, in written or printed matter, in 
such a manner as to indicate the pauses 
which would be made by the author if 
he were communicating h^s thoughts 
orally instead of by written signs. 

1648. Writing and printing are sub- 
stitutes for oral communication ; and 
correct punctuation is essential to con- 

i vey the meaning intended, and to giv

KNOWLEDGE MAKES HUMBLE ; 



due force to such passages ae the au- 
thor may wish to impress upon the 
mind of the person to whom they are 
being communicated. 

1649. The Points ara as follow ; 
The Comma , 

The Semicolon ; 

The Colon : 

The Period, rr Full Point . 

The Apostrophe ' 

The Hyphen, or Conjoiner - 

The Note of Interrogation ? 

The Note of Exclamation ! 

The Parenthesis ( ) 

The Asterisk, or Star * 
As these are all the points required in 
simple epistolary composition, we will 
confine our explanations to the rules 
which should govern the use of them. 

1650. But we will first state that the 
other points are the paragraph H ; the 
section ; the dagger t ; the double 
dagger | ; the rule ; the parallel || ; 
the bracket [ ] ; and some others. 
These, however, are quite unnecessary, 
except for elaborate works, and in 
these they are chiefly used for notes or 
marginal references. 

*1651. The comma , denotes the 
shortest pause ; the semicolon ; a 
little longer pause than the comma ; 
colon : a little longer pause than the 
eemicolon ; the period, or full point , 
the longest pause. 

1652. The relative duration of these 
pauses is described as 

While you count 
Comma . . . One 
Semicolon . . Two 
Colon .... Three 
Period . . . Four. 
This, however, is not an infallible rule, 
because the duration of the pauses 
should be regulated by the degree of 
rapidity with which the matter is being 
read. In slow reading, the duration of 
the pauses should be increased. 

1653. The other points are rather in- 
dications of expression, and of meaning 
and connection, than of pauses, and 
therefore we will notice them sepa- 
rately. 

1654 The mis^in of evE sr 



slight a point, or paue^, as the comma* 
will often alter the meaning of a sen* 
tence. The contract made for lighting 
the town of Liverpool, during the year 
181 9, was thrown void by the misplac- 
ing- of a comma in the advertisements 
thus " The lamps at present are 
about 4050, and have in general two 
spouts each, composed of not less than 
twenty threads of cotton." The con- 
tractor would have proceeded to fur- 
nish each lamp with the said twenty 
threads ; but this being but half the 
usual quantity, the commissioners dis- 
covered that the difference arose from 
the comma following instead of pftced- 
ing the word each. The parties agreed 
to annul the contract, and a new one 
was ordered. 

1655. The following sentence show's 
how difficult it is to read without the 
aid of the points used as pauses : 

Death waits not for storms or sun- 
shine within a dwelling in one of the 
upper streets respectable in appear- 
ance and furnished with such conveni- 
ences as distinguish the habitations of 
those who rank among the higher class- 
es of society a man of middle age lay 
on his last bed momently awaiting the 
final summons all that the most skilful 
medical attendance all that love warm 
as the glow that fires an angel's bosom 
could do had been done by day and 
night for many long weeks had minis- 
tering 1 spirits such as a devoted wife 
and loving children are done all within 
their power to ward off the blow but 
there he lay his raven hair smoothed 
off from his noble brow his dark eyes 
lighted with unnatural brightness and 
.contrasting strongly with the pallid hue 
which marked him as an expectant of 
the dread messenger. 

1656. The same sentence, properly 
pointed, and with capital letters placed 
after full points, according- to the 
adopted rule, may be easily read and 
understood : 

Death waits not for storm or sun- 
shins. Within a dwelling- in one of the 
upper streets, respectable in appear 
ance, and furnished with such conveni

ences as distinguish the habitations 
of those who rank among the higher 
'{lasses of society, a man of middle age 
lay on his last bed, momently awaiting 
the final summons. All that the most 
skilful medical attendance all that 
eve, warm as the glow that fires an 
angel's bosom, could do, had been 
ioue ; by day and night, for many long 
iveeks, had ministering spirits, such as 
a devoted wife and loving children are, 
Jone all within their power to ward off 
;he blow. But there he lay, his raven 
>iair smoothed off from his noble brow, 
his dark eyes lighted with Unnatural 
brightness, and contrasting strongly 
with the pallid hue which marked him 
as an expectant cf the dread mes- 
senger. 

lo'57. The apostrophe ' is used to 
indicate the combining of two words in 
one as John's book, instead of John, 
his book ; or to show the omission of 
parts of words, as Glo'ster, for Glouces- 
ter tho' for though. These abbrevia- 
tions should be avoided as much as 
possible. Cobbctt says the apostrophe 
" ought to be called the mark of lazi- 
ness and vulgarity." The first use, 
however, of which we gave an example, 
is a necessary and proper one. 

1658. The hyphen, or conjoiner - is 
used to unite words which, though they 
are separate and distinct, have so close 
a connection as almost to become one 
word, as water-rat, wind-mill, &c. It 
is also used in writing and printing, at 
the end of a line, to show where a 
word is divided anl continued in the 
next line. Look dtwn the ends of the 
lines in this column, i,nd you will notice 
the hyphen in seven \ places. 

1659. The note of interrogation^ )in- 
dicates that the sentence to which frt is 
nut asks a question, as " What is the 
meaning of that ass* rtion? What am 
I to do?" 

1060. The note of exclamation or of 
admiration (!) indica .'8 surprise, pleas 
ure, or s< rrow, as' Oh ! Ah ! Good- 
Ness Beautiful! I nm astonished! 
Woe \e me !" 

1661 The paret.il -sis ( ) is used 



to prevent confusion by the introduc- 
tion to a sentence, of a passage not 
necessary to the sense thereof. " I am 
going to meet Mr. Smith ^though I am 



no admirer 
next. 1 ' It 



of him) 
better, 



on Wednesday 
however, as a 



rule, not to employ parenthetical sen- 
tences. 

1662. The asterisk, or star * may 
be employed to refer from the text to 
a note of explanation at the foot of a 
column, or at the end of a letter. %* 
Three stars are sometimes used to call 
particular attention to a paragraph. 

1663. HINTS UPON SPELLING. 
The following rules will be found of 
great assistance in writing, because 
they relate to a class of words about 
the spelling of which doubt and hesita 
tion are frequently felt : 

1664. All words of one syllable end- 
ing in /, with a single vowel before it, 
have double I at the close : as, mill, 
sell. 

1665. All words of one syllable 
ending in /, with a double vowel before 
it, have one I only at the close : as, 
mail, sail. 

1606. Words of one syllable ending 
in /, when comounded, retain but one 



I each ; 
1667. 



ilfil, skilful. 
fords of more 



than one 



syllable ending in /, have one I only at 
the close ; as, delightful, faithful ; ex- 
cept befall, downfall, recall, unwell, &c. 

1668. All derivations from wordi 
ending in I have one I only ; as equality, 
from equal ; fulness, from full ; except 
they end in er or ly ; as mill, miller ; 
full, fully. 

1669. All participles in ing from 
verbs ending in e, lose the e final; as 
have, having ; amiwe, amusing ; unless 
they come from verbs ending in double 
e, and then they retain both ; as, see, 
seeing ; agree, agreeing. 

1670. All adverbs in ly and nouns in 



ment retain the 
tives; as, brave. 



e final of the prlmi- 
bravely; refine, refine 



ment ; except acknowledgment and judg- 
ment. 

1671. All derivations from words 
ending in er retain the before the r 



202 



KNOWLEDGE TALKS LOWLY 



as, refer i reference ; except hindrance, 
from hinder; remembrance, from remem- 
ber; disastrous, from disaster; mon- 
strous, from monster; won drous, from 
wonder ; cumbrous, from cumber, &c. 

1672. Compound words, if both end 
not in I, retain their primitive parts 
entire ; as, millstone, changeable, race- 
less ; except always, also, deplorable, 
although, cdmost, admirable, &c. 

1673. All one-syllables ending in a 
Consonant, with a single vowel before 
it, double that consonant in deriva- 
tives ; as sin, sinner; ship, shipping; 
biff, bigger ; glad, gladder, &C. 

1674. One-syllables ending in a, con- 
sonant, with a double vowel before 
it, do not double the consonant in 
derivatives; as, sleep, sleepy; troop, 
trooper. 

1675. All words of more than one 
syllable ending in a single consonant, 
preceded by a single vowel, and ac- 
cented on the last syllable, double that 
consonant in derivatives ; as, commit, 
committee', compel, compelled; appal, 
appalling ; distil, distiller. 

1676. Nouns of one syllable ending 
in y, preceded by a consonant, change 
y into ies in the plural ; and verbs end- 
ing in y, preceded by a consonant, 
Change y into ies in the third person 
singular of the present tense, and into 
ied in the past tense and past participle : 
as, fly, flies ; I apply, he applies ; we 
reply, we replied or have replied. If the 
y be preceded by a vowel, this rule is 
not applicable; as, key, keys ; I play, 
he plays; we have enjoyed ourselves. 

1677. Compound words whose primi- 
tives end io y change y into i; as beau- 
ti/. beautiful ; lovely, loveliness.

is of Polish origin. It consists of

the first movement commences. 

1701. THEREDOWA WALTZ is com- 
posed of three parts distinct from each 
other 1st, The pursuit. 2d, The 
waltz called Redowa. 3d, The waltz 
a Deux Temps, ex?ent 'd to a peculiar 



about the room. The position of the 
gentleman is the same as for the waltz. 
The gentleman sets out with the left 
foot, and the lady with the right. In 
the pursuit the position is different, the 
gentleman and his partner face, and 
take each other by the hand. They ad- 
vance or fall back at pleasure, and bal- 
ance in advance and backwards. To 
advance the step of the pursuit is made 
by a glissade forward, without spring- 
ing, coupe with the hind foot, and jete 
on it. You recommence with the other 
foot, and so on for the rest. The retir- 
ing step is made by a sliding step of the 
foot backwards, without spring, jete 
with the front foot, and coupe with the 
one behind. It is necessary to advance 
well on the sliding step, and to spring 
lightly on the two others, sur place, 
balancing equally in the pas depursutie, 
which is executed alternately by the 
left in advance, an 3 the right backwards. 
The lady should follow all the move- 
ments of her partner, falling back when 
he advances, and advancing when he 
falls back. Bring the shoulders a little 
forward at each sliding step, for they 
should always follow the movement of 
the leg as it advances or retreats ; but 
this should not be too marked. When 
the gentleman is about to waltz he 
should take the lady's waist, as in the 
ordinary waltz. The step of the Re- 
dowa, in turning, may thus be describ- 
ed. For the gentleman -jet'e of the 
left foot passing before the lady. Glis- 
sade of the right foot behind to the 
fourth position aside the left foot is 
brought to the third position behind 



then the pas de basque is executed b 
the right foot, bringing it forward, an 
you recommence with the left. The 
pas de basque should be made in 
three very equal beats, as in the Ma- 
zurks, The lady performs the same 
Btprv as the gentleman, beginning bj 



IGNORANCE BOASTFUL. CONCEITED, AND SURE.

the pas de basque with the right foot. 
To waltz a deux temps to the measure of 
the Redowa, we should make each step 
upon each beat of the bar, and find our- 
Belvc-s at every two bars, the gentleman 
with his left foot, and the lady with her 
right, that is to say, we should make 
ono whole and one half step to every 
bar. The music is rather slower than 
for the ordinary waltz. 

1702. VALSE CELLARIUS. The gen- 
tleman takes the lady's left hand with 
his right, moving one bar to the left by 
glissade, and two hope on his left foot, 
while the lady does the same to the 
right on her right foot; at the second 
bar they repeat the same with the other 
foot this is repeated for sixteen bars 
they then waltz sixteen bars, glissade 
and two hops, taking care to occupy 
the time of two bars, to get quite 
round. The gentleman now takes 
both hands of. the lady, and makes the 
grand square moving three -bars to his 
left at the fourth bar making two 
beats, while turning the angle his 
right foot is now moved forward to the 
other angle three bars, at the fourth 
beat again while turning the angle the 
game repeated for sixteen bars the 
lady having her right foot forward, when 
the gentleman has his left foot forward 
the waltz is again repeated ; after 
which several other steps are intro- 
duced, but which must needs be seen to 
be understood. 

1703. CIRCULAR WALTZ. The dan- 
cers form a circle, then promenade dur- 
ing the introduction all waltz sixteen 
bars set, holding partner's right hand, 
and turnwaltz thirty-two bars rest 
and turn partners slowly face partner 
and chassez to the right and left pi- 
rouette lady twice with the right hand, 
all waltz sixteen bars set and turn 
all form a circle, still retaining the lady 
by the right hand, and more round to 
the left, sixteen bars waltz for fi- 
nale. 

1704. POLKA WALTZES. The couples 
take hold of hands as in the usual waltz. 
First Waltz The gentleman hops the 
lef' foot wfll forward, thea Vvok ; and 



glissades half round. He then hops the 
right foot forward and back, and glis- 
sades the other half round. The lady 
performs the same steps, beginning 
with the right foot. Second The gen- 
tleman, hopping, strikes the left heel 
three times againsWhe right heel, and 
then jumps half round on the left foot; 
he then strikes the right heel three 
times against the left, and jumps on the 
right foot, completing the circle. The 
lady does the same steps with reverse 
feet Third. The gentleman raises up 
the left foot, steps it lightly on the 
ground forward, then stikes the right 
heel smartly twice, and glissades 
half round. The same is then done 
with the other foot. The lady begins 
with the right foot, 

1705. VALSE A DEUX TEMPS. 
This waltz contains, like the common 
waltz, three times, but differently di- 
vided. The first time consists of a 
gliding step ; the second a chassez, in- 
cluding two times in one. A chassez 
is performed by bringing one leg-ear 
the other, then moving it forward, back- 
ward, right, left, and round. The gen 
tleman begins by sliding to the left with 
his left foot, then performing a chassez 
towards the left with his right foot 
without turning at all during the first 
two times. He then slides backwards 
with his right leg, turning half round ; 
after which he puts his left leg behind 
to perform a chassez forward, turning 
then half round for the second time. 
The lady waltzes in the same manner, 
except that the first time she slides to 
the right with the right foot, and also 
performs the chassez on the right, and 
continues the same as the gentleman, 
except that she slides backwards with 
her right foot, when the gentleman 
slides with his left foot to the left ; and 
when the gentleman slides w;th hii 
right foot backwards, she slides with 
the left foot to the left. To perform 
this waltz gracefully, care must be 
taken to avoid jumping, but merely is 
slide, and keep the knees slightly 
bent.

company is arranged in couples round 
the room the ladies being placed on 
the right of the gentlemen, alter which 
the first and second couples load off the 
dance. Figure. Eight and left set and 
turn partners ladies chain waltz. At 
the conclusion, the" first couple with 
fourth, and the second with the tb>d 
couple, re-commence the figure and so 
n until they go completely round the 
ircle, when the dance is concluded. 

1707. POLKA. In the polka there are 
but two principal steps, all others be- 
long to fancy dances ; and much mis- 
chief and inconvenience is likely to 
arise from their improper introduction 
into the ball-room. First Step: The 
gentleman raises the left foot slightly 
behind the right, the right foot is then 
jumped upon, and the left brought for- 
ward with a glissade. The lady com- 
mences with the right, jumps on the 
left, and glissades with the right. 
The gentleman during his step has 
hold of the lady's left hand with his 
right. Second Step: The gentleman 
lightly hops the left foot forward on 
the neel, then hops on the toe, bring- 
ing the left foot slightly behind the 
right. He then glissades with the left 
foot forward ; the same is then done, 
commencing with the right foot. The 
lady dances the same step, only begin- 
ning with the right foot. There are a 
variety of other steps of a fancy char- 
acter, but they can only be understood 
with the aid of a master, and, even 
when well studied, must be introduced 
with care. The polka should be danced 
with grace-and elegance, eschewing all 
outre and ungainly steps and gestures, 
taking care that the leg is not lifted too 
high, and that the dance is not com- 
.nenced in too abrupt a manner. Any 
number of couples may stand up, and 
it is the privilege of the gentleman to 
'brm what figure he pleases, and vary 
it as often as his fancy and taste may 
dictate. First Figure: Four or eight 
bars are devoted'to setting forwards 
and backwaiJs, turning from and to- 
wards your partner, making a slight 
hop at the commencement of each set, 



and, holding your partner's left hand, 
you then perform the same step (for- 
wards) all round the room. Second 
Figure: The gentleman faces his partner, 
and does the same step backwards all 
round the room, the lady following with 
the opposite foot, and doing the step 
forwards. Third Figure : The same at 
the second figure, only reversed, the 
lady stepping backwards, and the gen- 
tleman forward*, always going the 
same way round the room. Fourth 
Figure: The same step as figures two 
and three, but turning as in a waltz. 

1708. THE GORLITZA is similar to 
the polka, the figures being waltzed 
through. 

1709. THE SCHOTTISHE. The gen- 
tleman holds the lady precisely as in 
the polka. Beginning with the right 
foot, he slides it forward, then brings up 
the right foot to the place of the left 
slides the left foot forward and springs 
or hops on this foot. This movement 
is repeated to the right. He begins 
with the right foot, slides it forward, 
brings up the left foot to the place of 
the right foot slides the right foot 
forward again, and hops upon it. The 
gentleman springs twice on the left 
foot, turning half round ; twice on the 
right foot; twice encore on the left 
foot, turning half round; and again 
twice on the right foot, turning half 
round. Beginning again, he proceeds 
as before. The lady begins with the 
right foot, and her step is the same in 
principle as the gentleman's. Vary, by 
a reverse turn ; or by going in a straight 
line round the- room.. Double, if you 
like, each part, by giving four bars to 
the first part, and four bars to the 
second part. The time may be stated 
as precisely the same as in the Polka; 
but let ifc not be forgotten that La 
Schottishe ought to be danced much 
slower.

er de Cover ly. First lady and bottom

First couple repeat with the third 
couple, then with fourth, and so on to

1712. THE HIGHLAND REEL. This 
dance has now become a great favorite ; 
it is performed by the company arranged 
in parties of three along the room in 
the following manner : a lady between 
two gentlemen in double rows all ad- 
vance and retire each lady then per- 
forms the reel with the gentleman on 
her right hand, and the opposite gentle- 
man to places hands three round and 
back again all six advance and retire 
then lead through to the next trio 
and continue the figure to the end of 
the room. Adopt the Highland step, 
and music of three -part tune.

1769. HINTS UPON PERSONAL 



MANNERS. It is sometimes object- 
ed to books upon etiquette that they 
cause those who consult them to act 
with mechanical restraint, and to show 
in society that they are governed by 
arbitrary rules, rather than by an intui- 
tive perception of what is graceful and 
polite. 

1770. This objection is unsound, 
because it supposes that people who 
study the theory of etiquette do not 
also exercise their powers of observa- 
tion in society, and obtain, by their in- 
tercourse with others, that freedom 
and ease of deportment, which society 
alone can impart. 

1771. Books upon etiquette are 
useful, inasmuch as that they expound 
the laws of polite society. Experience 
alone, however, can give effect to the 
precise manner in which those laws are 
required to be observed. 

1772. Whatever objections may be 
raised to the teachings of works upon 
etiquette, there can be no sound argu- 
ment against a series of simple and 
brief hints, which shall operate as pre- 
cautions against mistakes in personal 
conduct. 

1773. Avoid intermeddling with the 
affairs of others. This is a most com- 
mon fault. A number of people seldom 
meet but they begin discussing the af- 
fairs of some one who is absent. This 
is not only uncharitable but positively 
unjust. It is equivalent to trying a 
cause in the absence of the person impli- 
cated. Even in the criminal code a 
prisoner is presumed to be innocent un* 
til he is found guilty. Society, how- 
ever, is less just, and passes judgment 
without hearing the defence. Depend 
upon it, as a certain rule, that thepeople 
who unite with you in discussing the af- 
'airs of others icill proceed to scandalize 

you the moment that you depart. 

1774. Be consistent in the avowal of 
principles. Do not deny to-day that 
which you asserted yesterday. If you 
do, you will stultify yourself, and your 
opinions will soon be found to have no 
weight. You may fancy that you gau>

LITTLE DEEDS ARE LIKE LITTLE SEEDS 



favour by subserviency; but so far from 
gaining favour, you lose respect. 

1775. Avoid falsehood. There can be 
found no higher virtue thau the love of 
truth. The man who deceives others 
must himself become the victim of 
morbid distrust. Knowing the deceit 
of his own heart, and the falsehood of 
his own tongue, his eyes must be al- 
ways filled with suspicion, and he must 
lose the greatest of all happiness confi- 
dence in those who surround him. 

1776. The following elements of 
manly character are worthy of frequent 
meditation : 

1. To be wise in his disputes. 

2. To be a lamb in his home. 

3. To be brave in battle and great in 
moral courage. 

4. To be discreet in public. 

5. To be a bard in his chair. 

6. To be a teacher in his household. 

7. To be a councillor in his nation. 

8. To be an arbitrator in his vicinity. 

9. To be a hermit in his church. 

10. To be a legislator in his country. 

11. To be conscientious in his ac- 
tions. 

12. To be happy in his life. 

13. To be diligent in his calling. 

14. To be just in his dealing. 

15. That whatever he doeth be to the 
will of God. 

1777. Avoid manifestations of ill- 
temper. Reason is given for man's 
guidance. Passion isHhe tempest by 
which reason is overthrown. Under the 
effects of passion man's mind becomes 
disordered, his face disfigured, his body 
deformed. A moments passion has 
frequently c"ut off a life's friendship, de- 
stroyed a life's hope, embittered a life's 
peace, and brought unending sorrow 
and disgrace. It is scarcely worth while 
to enter into a comparative analysis of 
ill-temper and passion: they are alike 
discreditable, alike injurious, and should 
(stand equally condemned. 

1778. Avoid pride. If you are hand- 
some, God made you so ; if' you are 
learned, some one instructed you ; it 
you are rich, God gave you what you 
own It is for others to perceive your 



goodness; but you should be blind to 
your own merits. There can be no 
comfort in deenJ^^ yourself better than 
you really are : fo.t is self-deception. 
The best men throughout all history 
have been tb juv.t humble. 

1779. Affeci&tlon is a form of pride 
It is, in fact. frAe made ridiculous and 
contemptible Some one writing upon 
affectation bja remarked as follows: 

' If ftn;t.Hng will sicken and disgust 
a man, it is the affected mincing way in 
which Brittle people choose to talk. It 
is perf.'ct'/y naueecrs. If these young 
jackanp.pes who srrew thett words into 
all roj./mer of diabolical shapes could 
only foel how perfectly disgusting they 
were, it might induce them to drop it. 
Will* many, it soon becomes such a con- 
firnr/ed habit, that they cannot again be 
taught to talk in a plain, straight forward, 
mar.ly way. In the lower order of la- 
dies' boarding-schools, and indeed, too 
much everywhere, the same sickening 
mincing- tone is too often found. Do 
pray, good people, do talk in your natu- 
ral tone, if you don't wish to be utterly 
ridiculous and contemptible." 

1780. We have adopted the foregoing 
paragraph because we approve of some 
of its sentiments, but chiefly because it 
shows that persons who object to 
affectation may go to the other extreme 
vulgarity. It is vulgar, we think, to 
call even the most affected people 
"jackanapes, who screw their words 
into all manner of diabolical shapes." 
Avoid vulgarity in manner, in speech, 
and in correspondence. To conduct 
yourself vulgarly is to offer offence to 
those who are around you ; to bring 
upon yourself the condemnation of per- 
sons of good taste ; and to incur the 
penalty of exclusion from good society, 
Thus, cast among the vulgar, you be- 
come the victim of your own error. 

1781. Avoid swearing. An oath it 
but the wrath of a perturbed spirit. 

1782. It is mean. A man of high 
moral standing would rather trea* an 
offence with contempt, than sho\ bii 
indignation by an oath. 



THEY GROW TO FLOWERS, OR TO WEEDS. 



211 



1783. Ib is vulgar: altogether too 
low for a deceit man. 

1784. It is cowardly : implying a fear 
either of not being believed or obeyed. 

1785. It is ungentle-manly. A gentle- 
man, according to Webster, is a gentcd- 
man well-bred, refined. 

1786. It is indecent : offensive to 
delicacy, and extremely unfit for human 
ears. 

1787. It is foolish. " Want of de- 
cency is want of sense." 

1788. It is abusive to the mind 
which conceives the oath, to the tongue 
which utters it, and to the person at 
whom it is aimed. 

1789. It is venomous, showing a man's 
heart to be as a nest of vipers ; and 
every time he swears, one of them starts 
out from his head. 

1790. It is contemptible forfeiting the 
respect of all the wise and good. 

1791. It is wicked : violating the 
Divine law, and provoking the dis- 
pleasure of Him who will not hold him 
guiltless who takes His name in vain. 

1792. Be a gentleman. Moderation, 
decorum, and neatness, distinguish the 
gentleman; he is at all times affable, 
diffident, and studious to please. In- 
telligent and polite, his behaviour is 
pleasant and graceful. When he enters 
the dwelling of an inferior, he endeav- 
ours to hide, if possible, the difference 
between their ranks in life ; ever willing 
to assist those around him, he is neither 
unkind, haughty, nor overbearing. In 
the mansions of the rich, the correct- 
ness of his mind induces him to bend 
to etiquette, but not to stoop to adula- 
tion ; correct principle cautions him to 
avoid the gaming-table, inebriety, or 
any other foible that could occasion 
him self- reproach, pleased with the 

leasures of reflection, he rejoices to 
ee the gaieties of society, and is fasti 
dious upon no point of little import. 
Appear only to be a gentleman, and its 
elvnduw will bring upon you contempt: 
bo a gentleman, and its honors will 
remaiu even after you are dead. 



1793. THE TRUE GENTLEMAN. 

'Tis he whose every thought and deed 

By rule of virtue moves ; 
Whose generous tongue disdains to 
speak 

The thing his heart disproves. 
Who never did a slander forge, 

His neighbour's fame to wound ; 
Nor hearken to a false report, 

By malice whispered round. 
Who vice, in all its pomp and power, 

Can treat with just neglect ; 
And piety, though clothed in rags, 

Religiously respect. 
Who to his plighted word and trust 

Has ever firmly stood; 
And, though he promise to his loss, 

He makes his promise good. 
Whose soul in usury disdains 

His treasure to employ ; 
Whom no reward can ever bribe 

The guiltless to destroy 

1794. Be Honest. Not only because 
" honesty is the best policy," but be- 
cause it is a duty to God and to man. 
The heart that can be gratified by dis- 
honest gains ; the ambition that can be 
satisfied by dishonest means ; the mind 
that can be devoted to dishonest pur- 
poses, must be of the worst order. (Set 
281.) 

1795. Having laid down these gener- 
al principles for the government of 
personal conduct, we will epitomise 
what we would still enforce ; 

1796. Avoid Idleness it is the pa- 
rent of many evils. Can you pray, 
" Give us this day our daily bread," 
and not hear the reply, " Do thou this 
day thy daily duty ?" 

1797. Avoid telling idle tales, which 
is like firing arrows in the dark ; yoti 
know not into whose heart they may 
fall. 

1798. Avoid talking about yourself ; 
praising your own works ; and pro- 
claiming your own deeds. If they are 
good, they will proclaim themselves ; it 
bad, the less you say of them the better. 

1799. Avoid Envy, for it cannot 
benefit you, nor can it injure those 
against whom it is cherished. 



212 



A LADY MADE A QUILT IX 55,555 PIECES. 



1800. Avoid Disputation, for th< 
mere sake of argument. The man win 
disputes obstinately and in a bigotec 
spirit, in like the man who would sto] 
the fountain from which he shoul 
drink. Earnest discussion is commend 
able ; but factious argument never ye 
produced a good result. 

1801. Be kind in little things. The 
true generosity of the heart is more 
displayed by deeds of minor kindness 
than by acts which may partake of 
ostentation. 

1802. Be polite. Politeness is the 
poetry of conduct and like poetry il 
has many qualities. Let hot your po 
liteness be too florid, but of that gentle 
kind which indicates refined nature. 

1803. Be sociable avoid reserve in 
society. Remember that the social 
elements, like the air we breathe, are 
purified by motion. Thought illumines 
thought, and smiles win smiles. 

1804. Be punctual. One minute too 
late has lost many a golden opportunity. 
Besides which, the want of punctuality 
is an affront offered to the person to 
whom your presence is due. 

1805. The foregoing remarks may 
be said to apply to the moral conduct, 
rather than to the details of personal 
manners. Great principles, however, 
suggest minor ones ; and hence from 
the principles laid down many hints 
upon personal behaviour may be ga- 

1806. Be hearty in your salutations. 
1307. Discreet and sincere in your 

friendships. 

1808. Like to listen rather than to 
talk. 

1809. Behave, even in the presence 
of your relations, as though you felt 
respect to be due to them. 

1810. In society never forget that 
you are but one of many. 

1811 \Vhen you visit a friend, con- 
firm to the rules of his home. 

1812. Lean not upon his tables, nor 
rub your feet against his chairs. 

1813. Pry not into letters l^iat are 
not your own. 



1814. Pay unmistakable reppect tc 
ladies everywhere. 

1815. Beware of foppery and of siily 
flirtation. 

1816. In public places be not too 
pertinacious of your own rights. 

1817. Find pleasure in making con- 
cessions. 

1818. Speak distinctly. 

1819. Look at the person to whom 
you speak. 

1820. When you have spoken, give 
him an opportunity to reply. 

1821. Avoid drunkenness as you 
would a curse ; and modify all appe- 
tites, especially those that are acquired. 

1822. Dress well, but not superflu- 
ously. 

1823. Be neither like a sloven, nor 
like a stuffed model. 

1824. Keep away all uncleanly ap- 
pearances from the person. Let the 
nails, the teeth, and, in fact, the whole 
system receive salutary rather than 
studied care. But let these things 
receive attention at the toilet not 
elsewhere. 

1825. Avoid displaying excess of 
jewellery. Nothing 'looks more ef- 
feminate upon a man. 

1826. Everyone of these suggestions 
may be regarded as the centre of many 

thers, which the earnest mind cannot 
ail to discover. (See Enquiries upon 
Etiquette.} 

1827. HABITS OF A MAN OF 
BUSINESS. A sacred regard to the 

n'inciples of justice forms the basis of 
very transaction, and regulates the 
conduct of the upright man of business. 

He is strict in keeping his engage- 
ments. 

Does nothing carelessly or in a 
lurry. 

Employs nobody to do what he can 
asily do himself. 

Keeps everything in its proper 
lace. 

Leaves nothing undone that ought t 
e done, and which circumstances per- 
mit him to do. 

Keeps his designs and business from 
tie view of others.' 



AN HOUR IN THE MORNING IS WOETH TWO AT NIGHT. 



213 



Is prompt and decisive with his cus- 
tomers, and does not over-trude liis 
capital 

Prefers short credits to long ones ; 
and cash to credit at all times, either 
in buying or selling ; and small profits 
in credit cases, with little risk to the 
chance of better gains with more 
hazard. 

He is clear and explicit in all his 
bargains. 

Leaves nothing of consequence to 
memory which he can and ought to 
commit to writing. 

Keeps copies of all his important 
letters which he sends away, and has 
every letter, invoice, &c , relating to 
his business, titled, classed, and put 
away. 

Never suffers his desk to be confused 
by many papers lying upon it. 

Is always at the head of his business, 
well knowing that if he leaves it, it 
will leave him. 

Holds it as a maxim that he whose 
credit is suspected is not one to be 
trusted. 

Is constantly examining his books, 
and sees through all his affairs as far as 
care and attention will enable him. 

Balances regularly at stated times, 
and then makes out and transmits all 
his accounts current to his customers, 
both at home and abroad. 

Avoid as much as possible all sorts 
of accommodation in money matters 
and lawsuits where there is the least 
hazard. 

He is economical in his expenditure, 
always living within his income. 

Keeps a memorandum-book in his 
pocket, in which he notes every parti- 
cular relative to appointments, ad- 
dresses, and petty cash matters. 

Is cautious how he becomes security 
for any person ; and is generous when 
urged by motives of humanity. 

Let a man act strictly to these habits ; 
when once begun they will be easy to 
continue in ever remembering that 
he hath no profits by his pains whom 
Providence doth not prosper and suc- 
cess will attend his efforts. 



Take pleasure in your business, and 
it will become your recreation. 

Hope for the best, think for the 
worst, and bear whatever happens. 

1826. MILK LEMONADE. Die- 
solve three quarters of a pound of 
loaf sugar in one pintjDf boiling water, 
and mix with them one gill of lemon 
juice, and a gill of sherry, then add three 
gills of cold milk. Stir the whole well 
together, and strain it. 

1829. GROUND GLASS. The frosted 
appearance of ground glass may be very 
nearly imitated by gently dabbing the 
glass over with a piece of glazier's 
putty, stuck on the ends of the fingers. 
When applied with a light and even 
touch, the resemblance is considerable. 

1830. VEGETABLE SOUP. Peel and 
cut up very fine three onions, three 
turnips, one carrot, and four potatoes, 
put them into a stewpan with a quarter 
of a pound of butter, the same of lean 
ham, and a bunch of parsley, pass them 
ten minutes over a sharp fire ; then 
add a good spoonful of flour, mix well 
in, moisten with two quarts of broth 
and a pint of boiling milk, boil up, 
keeping it stirred, season with a little 
salt and sugar, and rub through a hair 
sieve, put it into another stewpan, boil 
again, skim and serve with fried bread 
in it. 

1831. To PICKLE GHERKINS. Put 
about two hundred and fifty in a pickle 
of two pounds, and let them remain in 
it three hours. Put them in a sieve to 
drain, wipe them, and place them in a 
jar. For a pickle, best vinegar one 
gallon : common salt, six ounces ; all- 
spice, one ounce; mustard seed, one 
ounce ; cloves, half an ounce ; mace, 
half an ounce; one nutmeg sliced; 
stick of horseradish sliced : boil fifteen 
minutes, skim it well. When cold 
pour it over them, and let stand twenty- 
four hours, covered up ; put them into 
a pan orer the fire, and let them 
simmer only until they attain a a green 
colour. Tie the jure down closely 
with bladder and leather. 

1832. To KILL COCKROACHES. A 
teacupful of well-bruised Plaster of 



214 



MORNING FOR WORK, EVENING FOR CONTEMPLATION'. 



Paris, mixed with double the quantity 
of oatmeal, to which add a little sugar 
(the latter is not essential). Strew it 
on the floor or iu the chinks were they 
frequent. 

1833. CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS. The 
following mixture is very useful in all 
cutaneous eruptions : Ipecacuanha 
wine, four drachms ; flowers of sulphur., 
two drachma ; tincture of cardamoms, 
one ounce. Mix. One teaspoonful to 
be taken three times a day, in a wine- 
glassful of water. 

1834. WHEN TO CHANGE THE WA- 
TER IN WHICH LEECHES ARE KEPT. 
Once a month in winter, and once a 
week in summer, is sufficiently often, 
unless the water becomes discoloured 
or bloody, when it should be changed 
every day. Either clean pond water, 
or clean rain water should be employed. 

1835. PEAS PUDDING. Dry a pint 
or quart of split peas thoroughly before 
the fire; then tie them up loosely in a 
cloth, put them into warm water, boil 
Jiem a couple of hours, or more, until 
quite tender ; take them up, beat them 
well in a dish with a little salt (some 
add the yolk of an egg) and a bit of 
butter. Make it quit smooth, tie it up 
again in a cloth, and boil it an hour 
longer. This is highly nourishing. 

1836. To ARREST BLEEDING AT THE 
NOSE. Introduce by means of a probe, 
a small piece of lint or soft cotton, pre- 
viously dipped into some mild styptic, 
as a solution of alum, white vitriol, 
creosote, or even cold water. This will 
generally succeed ; but should it not, 
cold water may be snuffed up the 
nostrils. Should the bleeding be very 
profuse, medical advice should be pro- 
cured. 

1837. To CLEAR VEGETABLES OF 
INSECTS. Make a strong brine of one 
pound and a half of salt to one gallon 
of water, into this place the vegetables 
with the stalk ends uppermost, for two 
or three hours; this will destroy all the 
insects which cluster in the leaves, 
and they will fall out and sink to the 
bottom of the water. 

1838. DISINFECTING FUMIGATION 



Common salt, three ounces ; black 
manganese, oil of vitriol, of each one 
ounce; water, two ounces. Carried in 
a cup through the apartments of the 
sick, or the apartments intended to be 
fumigated, where sickness has been, 
may be shut up for an hour or two, and 
then opened. 
1839. DEPILATORY OINTMENT 



FOR REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS 

Finely powdered quick lime, one ounce ; 
finely powdered orpiment, one dram; 
white of egg to mix. 

1840. TO PREVENT MICE TAKING 

PEAS. Previous to the peas being 
sown, they should be well saturated 
with a solution of bitter aloes ; or, they 
may be saturated with salad oil, and 
then rolled in some powdefed resin 
previous to sowing, and the mice will 
not touch them. 

1841. To POLISH ENAMELLED LEA- 
THER. Two pints of the best cream, 
one pint of linseed oil; make them 
each lukewarm, and then mix them 
well together. Having previously 
cleaned the shoe, &c., from dirt, rub it 
over with a sponge dipped in the mix- 
ture : then rub it with a soft dry cloth 
until a brilliant polish ie produced. 

1842. DEVONSHIRE JUNCKET. Put 
warm milk into a bowl, turn it with a 
little rennet, then add some scalded 
cream, sugar and cinnamon on the top, 
without breaking the curd. 

1843. To CLEAN BRASS ORNAMENTS. 
Wash the brass work with roche alum 
boiled to a strong ley, in the proportion 
of an ounce to a pint. When dry, it 
must be rubbed with a fine tripoli. 

1844. To RENOVATE SILKS. Sponge 
faded silks with warm water and soap, 
then rub them with a dry cloth on a 
flat board ; afterwards iron them on the 
inside with a smoothing iron. Old 
black silks may be improved by spong- 
ing with spirits; in this case the ironing 
may be done on the right side, thin 
paper being spread over to prevent 
glazing. 

1845. To TAKE OUT STAINS FROM 
MAHOGANY FURNITURE. Stains and 
spots may be taken out of mahog&n* 



MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES. 



215 



furniture b> the use of a little aqua- 
fortis or oxalic acid and water, by rub- 
bing the part with the liquid, by means 
of a cork, till the colour is restored ; 
observing afterwards to well wash the 
wood with water, and to dry and polish 
as usual. 

1846. BOILED TURNIP RADISHES. 
Boil in plenty of salted water, and in 
about twenty-five minutes they will be 
tender; drain well, and send them to 
table with melted butter. Common 
radishes, when young, tied in bunches, 
boiled for twenty minutes, and served 
on a toast, are excellent. 

1847. To REMOVE STAINS FROM 
MOURNING DRESSES. Boil a handful 
of fig leaves in two quarts of water 
until reduced to a pint. Bombazines, 
crape, cloth, &c., need only be rubbed 
with a sponge dipped in this liquor, and 
the effect will be instantly produced. 

1848. ICELAND Moss CHOCOLATE 
FOR THE SICK ROOM. Iceland moss has 
been in the highest repute on the con- 
tinent as a most efficacious remedy in 
incipient pulmonary complaints ; com- 
bined with chocolate, it will be found 
a nutritious article of diet, and may be 
taken as a morning and evening bever- 
age. Directions : Mix a teaspoonful 
of thj chocolate, with a teaspoonful of 
boiling water or milk, stirring constant- 
ly until it is completely dissolved. 

1849. A HINT ON HOUSEHOLD 
MANAGEMENT. Have you ever ob- 
served what a dislike servants have to 
anything cheap? They hate saving 1 
their master's money. I tried this ex- 
periment with great success the other 
day. Finding we consumed a vast deal 
of soap, I sat down in my thinking- 
chair, and took the soap question into 
consideration, and found reason to sus- 
pect we were using a very expensive 
article, where a much cheaper one 
would serve the purpose better. I or- 
dered half a dozen pounds of both sorts, 
but took the precaution of changing the 
papers on which the prices were mark- 
ed before giving them into the hands of 
Betty. "Well, Betty, which soap do 



you find washes best?" "Oh, please 
sir, the dearest, in the blue paper ; it 
makes a lather as well again as the 
other." "Well, Betty, you shall al- 
ways have it then ; and thus the unsus- 
pecting Betty saved me some pounds a 
year, and washed the clothes better. 
Rev. Sidney Smith. 

1850. TO THOSE WHO WRITE 
FOR THE PRESS. It would be a 
great favor to editors and printers, 
should those who write for the presa 
observe the following rules. They are 
reasonable, and our correspondents will 
regard them as such: 1. Write with 
black ink, on white paper, wide ruled. 
2. Make the pages small, one-fourth 
that of a foolscap sheet. 3. Leave the 
second page of each leaf blank. 4. Give 
to the written page an ample margin all 
round. 5. Number the papers in the 
order of their succession. 6. Write in 
a plain bold hand, with less respect to 
beauty. 7. Use no abbreviations which 
are not to appear in print. 8. Punctu- 
ate the manuscript as it should be 
printed. 9. For italics underscore one 
line, for small capitals, two ; capitals, 
three. 10. Never interline without the 
caret to show its place. 11. Take spe- 
cial pains with every letter in proper 
names. 12. Review every word, to be 
sure that none is illegible. 13. Put 
directions to the printer, at the head of 
the first page. 14. Never write a pri- 
vate tetter to the editor on the printer's 
copy, but always on a separate sheet. 

1851. DIAPHANIE. This is a 
beautiful, useful, and inexpensive art, 
easily acquired, and producing imita- 
tions of the richest and rarest stained 
glass ; and also of making blinds, 
screens, skylights, Chinese lanterns, 
&c., in every variety of colour and de 
sign. 

1852. In decorating his house, au 
American spends as much money as he 
can conveniently spare ; the elegances 
and refinements of modern taste de- 
mand something more than mere com- 
fort; yet though his walls are hung 
with pictures, his drawing-room filled 
with bijouterie, how is it that tho win 



216 



THE LOVLIKST Bill]) HAS NO SOXCJ. 



dows of his hall, his library, hie stair- 
case arc neglected ? The reason is ob- 
vious. The magnificent historical old 
stained glass might be envied, but could 
not be brought within the compass of 
ordinary means. Recent improvements 
in printing in colours led the way to 
this beautiful invention, by which econ- 
omy is combined with the most perfect 
results. 

1853. A peculiar kind of paper is 
rendered perfectly transparent, upon 
which designs are printed in glass col- 
ours (vitro de r.oulcurs), which will not 
change with the light. The paper is 
applied to the glass with a clear white 
varnish, and when dry, a preparation is 
finally applied, which increases the 
transparency, and adds tenfold brillian- 
cy fro the effect. 

1854. There is another design, print- 
ed in imitation of the half-light (abat- 
iour), this is used principally for a 
ground, covering the whole surface of 
the glass, within which (the necessary 
spaces having been previously cut out 
before it is stuck on the glass), are 
placed medallion centres of Watteau 
figures, perfectly transparent, which 
derive increased brilliancy from the 
semi-transparency of the surrounding 
ground. 

1855. To ascertain the quantity of 
designs required, measure your glass 
carefully, and then calculate how many 
sheets it will take. The sheets are 
arranged so that they can be joined 
together continuously, or cut to any 
size or shape. 

1856. PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS. 
Choose a fine day for the operation, as 
the glass should be perfectly dry and 
unaffected by the humidity of the at- 
mosphere. Of course if you have a 
choice, it is more convenient to work on 
your glass before it is fixed in the frame. 
If you are working on a piece of unat- 
tached glass, lay it on aflat table (a 
marble slab is preferable), over which 
you must previously lay a piece of 
baize or cloth to keep the glass steady. 
The glass being thus fixed, clean and 
polish the side on which you intend to 



operate (in windows thip is the innei 
side), then with your bnsh lay on it 
very equably a good coat of the pre- 
pared varnish ; let this dry for an hour, 
more or less, according to the drynepa 
of the atmosphere and the thickness of 
the coat of varnish ; meantime cut and 
trim your designs carefully to fit the 
glass (if it is one entire transparent 
sheet you will find little trouble) ; then 
lay them on a piece of paper, lico 
downwards, and damp the back of them 
with a sponge, applied several times, to 
equalize the moisture. In this opera- 
tion, arrange your time, so that your 
designs may now be finally left to dry 
for fifteen minutes before application to 
the glass, the varnish on which has now 
become tacky or sticky, and in a pro- 
per state to receive them. Apply the 
printed side next to the glass without 
pressure ; endeavor to let your sheet 
fall perfectly level and smooth on your 
glass so that you may avoid leaving 
creases, which would be fatal. Take 
now your palette, lay it flat on the de- 
sign, and press out all the air bubbles, 
commencing in the centre, and working 
them out "rom the sides; an ivory 
stick will be found useful in remov- 
ing creases ; you now leave this to dry, 
and after twenty four hours apply a 
slight coat of the liqueur diaphane, 
leaving it another day, when if dry, 
apply a second coat of the same kind 
which must be left several days: final 
ly, apply a coat of varnish over all. 

1857. If these directions are care 
fully followed, your glass will never b 
affected by time or by any variation 
in the weather ; it will defy hail, rain, 
frost and dust, and can be washed the 
same as any ordinary stained glass, to 
which, in some respects, it is even 
superior. 

1858. It is impossible to enumerate 
the variety of articles to ttie manufac

be accomplished in the following 
manner: 

1859. Stretch your paper, or what- 
ever it may be, on a frame or drawing 
board, then apply two successive coats 
^a day between each), of diaphanous 
liquor, and after leaving it to dry for 
several days, cover it with a thin 
layer of very clear size, and when dry 
it will be in a fit state to receive the 
coat of varnish and the designs. 

1860. Silk, linen, or other stuffs, 
should be more carefully stretched, and 
receive a thicker coat of size than 
paper or parchment ; the latter may be 
strained on a drawing or any other 
smooth board, by damping the sheet, and 
after pasting the edges, stretching it 
down while damp (silk, linen, and other 
stuffs require to be carefully stretched 
on a knitting or other suitable frame). 
Take great care to allow, whatever you 
use, time to dry before applying the 
liqueur diaphane. 

1861. All kinds of screens, lamp 
shades, and glasses, lanterns, &c. &c., 
may be made in this way, as heat will 
produce no effect upon them. The 
transparent pictures are successful, be- 
cause they may be hung on a window 



frame or removed at 



and the 



window blinds are far superior to any- 
thing of that kind that have yet been 



seen. 

1862. Instead of steeping the 



de- 



signs in the transparent liquor at the 
time of printing them, which was 
previously done in order to show their 
transparency to the purchaser, but 
which was practically objectionable, 
as the paper in that state was brittle, 
and devoid of pliancy, necessitating 
also the use of a peculiarly difficult 
vehicle to manage (varnish) in apply- 
ing it to the glass, the manufacturer 
now prepares his paper differently, in 
order to allow the use of parchment- 
gize in sticking them on the glass. 
The liqueur diaphane, which is finally 
applied, renders them perfectly trans- 
parent. In this mode of operation, 
no delay is requisite, the designs being 



laying on the size, taking :are to press 
out all the air bubbles, for which pur- 
pose a roller will be found indispensa- 
ble. The designs should be damped 
before the size is applied to them. 

1863. We are of opinion that this 
art may be applied to the production 
of magic lantern slides, dissolving 
views, and dioramic effects ; though we 
are not aware whether such experi 
ments have been tried. 

1864 . POTICHOMANIE. This 
elegant accomplishment, which has be- 
come so extremely popular and fashion- 
able, promises not only to supersede 
altogether many of those meretricious 
accomplishments which have hitherto 
absorbed the attention of our fair coun- 
trywomen, but to rank among the Fine 
Arts. It possesses many advantages 

1st. The process is simple, and easily 
acquired. 

2nd. It is an exceedingly pleasing and 
interesting employment, requiring no 
previous knowledge of drawing, yet 
affording abundant space for the exercise 
of the most exquisite taste. 

3rd. The time employed is richly re- 
paid ; the results produced are of actual 
value; articles of ornament and domes- 
tic utility being produced, in perfect 
imitation of the most beautiful Chinese 
and Japanese Porcelain, of Sevres and 
Dresden China, and of every form that 
is usual in the productions of the Cera- 
mic Art. 

4th. It furnishes an inexhaustible and 
inexpensive source for the production 
of useful and elegawt presents, which 
will be carefully preserved as tokens oi 
friendship, and as proofs of the taste 
and talent of the giver. 

1865. ARTICLES NECESSARY IN THE 
ART OF POTICHOMANIE. 

1st. Glass vases (Potiches en vcrre) 
of shapes suitable to the different orders 
of Chinese, Japanese, Etruscan, and 
French Porcelain, Alumettes, &c. 
cups, 



plates, &c., &c., of Sevres and 
Dresden design. 

2nd. Sheets of coloured drawings 



the glass immediately after ' or prints characteristic representut'/na 



218 



FIRST BE JUST ; THEN YOU MAY BE GEXEROUS. 



of the designs or decorations suitable to 
every kind of porcelain and cbina. 

3rd. A bottle of liquid guru. 

4th. Three or four hog-hair brushes. 

5th. A bottle of varnish. 

6th. Very fine pointed scissors for 
cutting out. 

7th. An assortment of colours for the 
foundation, in bottles. 

8th. A packet of gold powder. 

9th. A glass vessel for diluting the 
colours. 

1866. DIRECTIONS. We will sup- 
pose the object selected for imitation 
to be a Chinese vase. After providing 
yourself with a plain glass vase, of the 
proper shape, you take your sheets of 
coloured prints on which are depicted 
subjects characteristic of that peculiar 
style. 

1867. From these sheets you can 
select a great variety of designs, of the 
most varied character, on the arrange- 
ment and grouping of which you will 
exercise your own taste. 

1868. After you have fully decided 
upon the arrangement of your drawings, 
cut them out accurately with a pair of 
scissors, then apply some liquid gum 
carefully over the coloured side of the 
drawings, and stick them on the inside 
of the vase, according to your own pre- 
vious arrangement pressing them down 
till they adhere closely, without any 
bubbles of air appearing between the 
glass and the drawings. 

1869. When the drawings have had 
sufficient time to dry, take a fine brush 
and cover every part of them ('without 
touch'D'g the glass) with a coat of 
parchment size or liquid gum, which 
prevents the oil colour (which is next 
applied) from sinking into or becoming 
absorbed by the paper. 

1870. When the interior of the vase is 
perfectly dry, and any particles of gum 
eizc that may have been left on the 
glass, have been removed, your vase is 
ready for the final and most important 
process. 

1871. Yon have now to tint the whole 
of the vase with a proper colour to give 
it the appearance of porcelain, for up to 



this time you will recollect it is but 
glass vase, with a few coloured print! 
stuck thereon. 

1872. Select from your stock of pre- 
pared colours, in bottles, the tint most 
appropriate to the kind of china you are 
imitating (as we are now supposed t<> 
be making a Chinese vase, it will be 01 
a greenish hue), mix fully sufficient 
colour in a glass vessel, then pour the 
whole into the vase. Take now your 
vase in both hands and turn it round 
continually in the same direction, until 
the colour is equally spread over the 
whole of the interior ; when this is 
satisfactorily accomplished, pour back 
the remainder. If the prepared colour 
is too thick, add a little varnish to the 
mixture before applying it. 

1873. If preferred, the colour may be 
laid on with a soft brush. Should the 
vase be intended to hold water, the in- 
terior must be well varnished after the 
above operations, or lined with zinc 
or tin foil. 

1874. If the Potichomanist wishes to 
decorate the mouth of his vase with a 
gold border, he can do so by mixing 
some gold powder in a few drops of the 
essence of lavender and some varnish, 
applying it on the vase with a fine 
brush ; or he can purchase gold bands, 
already prepared for application, in 
varied sheets, suitable to the Potiche- 
manie designs. 

1875. Potichomanists have found the 
art capable of greater results than the 
mere imitation of porcelain vases, by the 
introduction of glass panels (previously 
decorated with beautiful flowers on a 
white ground) into drawing-room doors, 
and also into walls which, being panel 

Sapered, offer opportunities of intro- 
ucing centre pieces of the same cha- 
racter as the doors ; elegant chess and 
work-tables, folding and cheval-screens, 
panels for cabinets, chiffioniers and 
aook-cases, slabs for pier and console- 
tables, glove-boxes, covers for books, 
music, albums, &c. 

1876. WAXEN FLOWERS AND 
FRUIT. There is no art more easily

acquired, nor more encouraging in its 
immediate results, than that of model- 
ling 1 flowers and fnrt in wax. We do 
not mean that it is easy to attain the 
highest perfection in this art ; but 
that, compared with other pursuits of a 
(similar nature, the difficulties to be 
surmounted are comparatively few ; 
and the first rewards of perseverance 
come very speedily, and are surpris- 
ingly agreeable. The art, however, is 
attended by this drawback that tbe 
materials required are somewhat ex- 
pensive. But then, the flowers pro- 
duced are of value, and this is a set-off 
against the cost. 

1877. The materials required for com- 
mencing waxen-flower making will cost 
from $5,00 to $10,00 ; and no progress 
can be made without this outlay at the 
starting. 

1878. The materials may be obtained at 
jiiost fancy repositories in large towns ; 
and persons wishing to commence the 
art would do well to call at those places 
and inquire the particulars, and see the 
specimens of materials ; because, in 
tnis, as in every other pursuit, there 
are novelties and improvements being 
introduced which no book can give an 
idea of. 

1879. Those who reside in places 
where they cannot obtain the requisite 
materials, may procure information by 
writing to any of the many dealers in 
those articles in New York. 

1880. There are some small works 
published, which profess to teach the 
art. 

1881. But they are, in fact, written 
by professors, and the chief aim of them 
is to sell the materials, which they are 
written to advertise. 

1882. Those who wish to pursue ;.he 
subject further than our instructions 
will take them, may be able to refer to 
either or all of the works mentioned. 

1883. Printed instructions are, how- 
ever, of comparatively little value, ex- 
cept at the starting, to supply the 
(simplest elements of the art. 

1884. The petals, haves, &c. of flowers, 
Are made of sheets of coloured wax, 

10 



which may be purchased in packets of 
assorted colours. 

1885. The stems are made of wire of 
suitable thicknesses, covered with silk, 
and overlaid with wax ; and the leaves are 
frequently made by thin sheets of wax 
pressed upon leaves of embossed calico. 
Leaves of various descriptions are to be 
obtained of the persons who sell the 
materials for wax-flower making. 

1886. Ladies will often find among 
their discarded artificial flowers, leaves 
and buds that will serve as the base of 
their wax models. 

1887. The best guide to the construc- 
tion of a flower far better than printed 
diagrams or patterns is to take a 
flower, say a tulip, a rose, or a camelia. 
If possible, procure two flowers, nearly 
alike, and carefully picking one of them 
to pieces, lay the petals down in the 
order in which they are taken from the 
flower, and then cut paper patterns 
from them, and number them from the 
centre of the flower, that you may 
know their relative positions. 

1888. The perfect flower will guide you 
in getting the wax petals togethe' and 
will enable you to give not only to eacn 
petal, but to the contour of the flower, 
the characteristics which are natural to 
it. In most cases they are merely 
pressed together and held in their 
places by the adhesiveness of the wax. 
From the paper patterns the wax petals 
or other portions of the flowers may be 
cut. They should be cut singly by a 
scissors rather loose at the points ; and 
the scissors should be frequently dipped 
into water to prevent the wax from 
adhering to the blades. 

1889. The scraps of wax that fall from 
the cuttings will be found useful for 
making seed vessels, and other parts of 
the flowers. 

1890. Very few and very simple instru- 
ments are required, and these may be 
purchased at the place where the wax 
sheets, &c., are obtained. 

1891. With regard to the leaves of 
flowers,where the manufactured founda- 
tions of them cannot be obtained, pat- 
terns of them should be cut in paper, and 



220 



ALL'S WKLL THAT EXDS WELL. 



theveinous appearance may be imparted 
to the wax by pressing the leaf upon it. 

1692. In the construction of sprigs it is 
most important to be guided by sprigs 
of the natural plant, as various kinds of 
plants have many different charac- 
teristics in the grouping of their flowers, 
leaves, and branches. 

3893. It would be possible to extend 
these instructions to an indefinite length, 
but nothing would be gaineU thereby. 
The best instruction of all is TAKE A 
FLOWER AND COPY IT, observing care 
in the selection of good sheets of wax, 
and seeing that their colours are pre- 
cisely those of the flower you desire to 
imitate. 

1894. For the tints, stripes, and spots 
of variegated flowers, you will be supplied 
with colours among the other materials, 
and the application of them is precisely 
upon the principle of water- colour 
painting. 

1895. With regard to the imitations of 
fruit in wax, very different rules are to 
be observed. The following directions 
are from a reliable source : The 
material of which moulds for waxen 
fruit should be composed, is the best 
plaster of Paris, which can be bought 
from the Italian figure-makers at about 
a penny a pound, in bags containing 
fourteen pounds, or half-bags contain- 
ing seven pounds. If this cannot be 
procured, the cheaper plaster from the 
oil-shops may be substituted, if it can 
be procured quite fresh. If, however, 
the plaster is faulty, the results of the 
modelling will of course be more or 
less so also. It is the property of 
plaster of Paris to form a chemical union 
with water, and to form a paste which 
rapidly " sets" or hardens into a sub- 
Btance of the density of firm chalk. 
The mould must, therefore, be made by 
an impression from the object to be 
imitated, made upon the plaster before 
it sets. 

1896. The use of an elastic fruit in 
early experiments, leads to a want of 
accuracy in the first steps of the opera- 
tion, which causes very annoying diffi- 
culties afterwards ; and therefore a 



<>olid, inelastic body an egg boiled 
hard is recommended as the first ob- 
ject to be imitated. 

1897. Having filled a small pudding 
basin about three quarters full of damp 
sand (the finer the better) ; lay the egg 
lengthways in the sand, so that half of 
it is above, and half below, the level of 
the sand, which should be perfectly 
smooth around it. Then prepare the 
plaster in another basin, which should 
be half full of water. Sprinkle the 
plaster in quickly till it comes to the 
top of the water, and then, having 
stirred it for a moment with a spooii, 
pour the whole upon the egg in iliu 
other basin. 

1898. While the /m//mould thus made 
is hardening thoroughly, carefully re- 
move every particle of plaster from the 
basin in which it was mixed, and also from 
the spoon which has been used. Thir 
must be done by placing them both in 
water and wiping them perfectly clean. 
This is highly important, since a small 
quantity of plaster which has set will 
destroy the quality of a second mixing 
if it is mixed therewith. In about five 
minutes the half mould will be fit to 
remove, which may be done by turning 
the basin up with the right hand (tak- 
ing care not to lose the sand), so that 
the mould falls into the left hand. The 
egg should then be gently allowed to 
fall back on the sand out of the mould ; 
if, however, it adheres, lightly scrape 
the plaster from the edge of the mould, 
and then shake it out into the hollow 
of the hand. If, however, the exact 
half of the egg has been immersed in 
the sand, no such difficulty will arise ; 
this shows how important is exactness 
in the first position of the object from 
which a casting is to be taken. The 
egg being removed and laid aside, the 
mould or casting must be " trimmed ;" 
that is, the sand must be brushed from 
the flat surface of the mould with a 
nail-brush very slightly, without touch 
ing the extreme and sharp edges where 
the hollow of the mould commences. 
Then upon the broad edge from which 
the sand has been brushed, make fottf 



TRUTH IS THE HIDDEN GEM WE ALL SHOULD DIG FOR. 



221 



equi-distant hollows (with the round 
end of a table-knife) like the deep im- 
pression of a thimble's end. These are 
to guide hereafter in the fixing of the 
second half of the mould. The egg 
should now be replaced in the casting, 
and the edge of the cast, with the holes, 
thoroughly lubricated with sweet oil, 
laid on with a feather, or what is better, 
a large camel-hair brush. 

1899. Into the small pudding-basin 
from which the sand has been emptied, 
place with the egg uppermost the half 
mould, which, if the operation has been 
managed properly, should fit close at 
the edges to the side of the vessel ; then 
prepare some more liqid plaster as 
before, and pour it upon the egg and 
mould, and while it is hardening, round 
it with the spoon as with the first 
half. 

1900. In due time remove the whole 
from the basin : the halves will be found 
readily separable, and the egg being re- 
moved, the mould is ready to cast in, 
after it has been set aside for an hour 
or two so as to completely harden. 
This is the simplest form of mould, and 
all are made upon the same principle. 

1901. The casting of an egg is not 
merely interesting as the first step in a 
series of lessons,but as supplying a means 
of imitating peculiarly charming objects, 
which the natural historian tries almost 
in vain to preserve. We shall proceed, 
then, with the directions for the casting 
of an egg in the mould. 

1902. For the first experiments, com- 
mon yellow wax may be used as the 
material, or the ends of half-burnt wax- 
candles. The materials of the hard 
(not tallow) composition mould candles 
will also answer. 

1903. Every large object to be imitated 
in wax should be cast hollow ; and there- 
fore, though the transparent lightness 
required in the imitation of fruits is not 
requisite in an artificial egg, we shall 
east the egg upon the same principle as 
a fruit. 

1st. The two pieces of the plaster 
of Paris mould must be soaked in hot 
water for ten minutes. 



nd. The wax should in the mean- 
time be very slowly melted in a small 
tin saucepan, with A spout to it, care 
being taken not to allow it to boil, or 
it will be discoloured. As to the quan- 
tity of wax to be melted, the following 
is a general rule : If a lump, the size 
of the object to be imitated, be placed 
in the saucepan, it should be sufficient 
for casting twice, at least. 

3d. As soon as the wax is melted 
thoroughly, place the saucepan on the 
hob of the grate, and taking the parts 
of the mould from the hot water, re- 
move the moisture from their surfaces 
by pressing them gently with a hand- 
kerchief or soft cloth. It is necessary 
to use what is called in some of the arts 
" a very light hand " in this operation, 
especially in drying moulds of fruits, 
whose aspect possesses characteristic 
irregularities such as those on the 
orange, the lemon, or the cucumber. 
The mould must not be wiped but only 
pressed. If the water has not been hot 
enough, or if the drying is not perform- 
ed quickly, the mould will be too cold, 
and the wax will congeal too rapidly, 
and settle in ridges and streaks ; on the 
other hand, if the wax has been made 
too hot, it will adhere to the mould, 
and refuse to come out entire. 

4th. Having laid the two halves of 
the mould so that there can be no mis- 
take in fitting the one in its exact place 
quickly on the other, pour from the 
saucepan into one of the half moulds 
nearly as much wax as will fill the 
hollow made by the model (egg), quickly 
fit the other half on the top of it, 
squeeze the two pieces tightly together 
in the hand, and still holding them thus, 
turn them over in every possible posi- 
tion, so that the wax which is slowly 
congealing in the internal hollow of 
the mould may be of equal thickness 
in all parts. Having continued this 
process at least two minutes , the hands 
( i till holding and turning the mould) 
may be immersed in cold water to ac- 
celerate the cooling process. The per- 
fect congealment of the wax may be 
known, after a little experience, by the 



222 



IT IS A FOUL TONGUE THAT GIVES FORTH FALodflOOD. 



absence of the sound of fluid on shak- 
ing the mould. 

rth. As soon as the mould is com- 
pletely cooled, the halves may be sepa- 
rated carefully, the upper being lifted 
straight up from the under, and if the 
operation has been properly managed, 
a waxen egg will be turned out of the 
mould. 

6th. The egg will only require trim- 
rin<.r, that is, removing the ridge which 
marks the line at which the halves of 
ihe mould joined, and polishing out the 
cratches or inequalities left by the 
knife with a piece of soft rag, wet with 
spirits of turpentine or spirits of wine. 

1904. It is always desirable, when 
the materials and moulds are prepared, 
to make several castings of the same 
object, as the moulds are apt to get 
chipped when laid by in a cupboard ; 
and for this reason, as well as for the 
sake of practice, we recommend our 
pupils to make at least a dozen waxen 
eggs before they proceed to any other 
object. If they succeed in this com- 
pletely, they may rest assured that 
every difficulty which is likely to meet 
them in any future operations will be 
easily overcome. 

That these results of experiment 
may be rendered correct imitations of 
the object from whose form they were 
modelled, we shall now add a few fur- 
ther directions: 

1905. To colour the wax. While the 
wax is yet on the hob, and fluid, stir 
into it a little flake rchite, in powder, 
and continue to stir the mixture while 
it is being 'poured into the half mould. 
It will be found that unless the fixing 
and shaking of the moulds is managed 
quickly, the colouring matter will settle 
on the side of the half into which the 
mixture is poured; a little care in 
manipulation is therefore again re- 
quisite. 

] 906. To produce a good imitation of 
the surface. It will be noted by the 
close observer, that the shell of the 
common hen's egg has a number of 
minute holes, which destroy the perfect 
smoothness of its appearance. This 



peculiarity is imitated in the following 
simple manner: in the first place, very 
slightly prick with a fine needle the 
surface of your \v;ixen egg-, and then, 
having smeared it with spirits of tur- 
pentine, rub the surface all over, so as 
nearly to obliterate the marks of the 
needle point. 

1907. The simple experiment which 
has just been described really embodies 
all that need be said to start the pupil 
in his first endeavour. The colouring 
of the wax is a matter which comes 
easily enough by experiment. Oranges, 
lemons, large gooseberries, small cu- 
cumbers, &c.,&c., are excellent objects 
for practice. 

1908. FEATHER FLOWERS. 
The art of making Feather Flowers, 
though a very easy and inexpensive 
accomplishment, and yielding pretty 
ornaments for the mantel-piece or the 
chiffioneer, is but little pursued. Many 
persons are under the impression that 
they can only be made from the feathers 
of exotic birds, and that these are ex- 
pensive. But the following instructions 
will dispel this misconception, and re- 
move the difficulty. There is a mag- 
nificent boquet of feather flowers in the 
Crystal Palace, west of the centre 
transept, made according to these di- 
rections : 

1909. Procure the best white geese 
or swans' feathers, have them plucked 
off the fowl with care not to break the 
web, free them from down, except a 
small quantity on the shaft of the 
feather. 

1910. Having procured two good 
specimens of the flower you wish to 
imitate, carefully pull oft' the petals 
of one, and, with a piece of tissue pa 
per, cut out the shape of each size, 
taking care to leave the shaft , f the 
feather at least half an inch longer than 
the petal of the flower. Carefully 
bend the feather with the thumb and 
finger to the proper shape ; mind not 
to break the web. 

1911. TO MAKE THE STEM AND 

HEABT OF A FLOWER Take a piece 
of wire six inches long ; across the top 



THE MAN MUST BE GOOD WHO HAS MANY ENEMIES. 



223 



lay a small piece of cotton wool, turn 
the wire over it, and wind it round until 
it is the size of the heart or centre of 
the flower you are going to imitate. If 
a single flower, cover it with paste or 
velvet of the proper ee!our, and round 
it must be arranged the stamens ; these 
are made of fine India silk, or feathers 
may be used for this purpose. After 
the petals have been attached, the silk 
or feather is dipped into gum, and then 
into the farina. Place the petals round, 
one at a time, and wind them on with 
Moravian cotton, No. 4; arrange them 
as nearly like the flower you have for 
a copy as possible. Cut the stems of 
the feathers even, and then make the 
calix of feathers, cut like the pattern 
or natural flower. For the small flow- 
ers the calix is made with paste. 
Cove- the stems with paper or silk the 
game as the flowers ; the paper must 
be cut in narrow strips, about a quarter 
of an inch wide. 

1912. TO MAKE THE PASTES OF 
THE CALIX, HEARTS, ANU BUDS OF 
FLOWERS. Take common white starch 
and mix it with gum water until it is 
the substance of thick treacle ; colour 
it with the dyes used for the feathers, 
and keep it from the air. 

1913. TO MAKE THE FARINA. Use 

common ground rice, mixed into a stiff" 
paste with any dye ; dry it before the 
fire, and when quite hard, pound it to 
a fine powder. The buds, berries, and 
hearts of some double flowers are made 
with cotton wool, wound around wire, 
moulded to the shape with thumb and 
finger. Smooth it over with gum 
water, and when dry, cover the buds, 
berries, or calix with the proper col- 
oured pastes ; they will require one or 
two coats, and may be shaded with a 
little paint, and then gummed and left 
to dry. 

1914. Flowers of two or more shades 
or colors are variegated with water- 
colours, mixed with lemon-juice, ultra- 
marine and chrome for blue, and gold 
may also be used in powder, mixed with 
lemon-juice and gum water. 

1915. The materials required are 



some good white goose or swan's fea- 
thers ; a little fine wire, different sizes; 
a few skeins of fine floss silk, some good 
cotton wool or wadding, a reel of No, 4, 
Moravian cotton, a skein of India silk, 
the starch and gum for pastes, and a 
pair of small sharp scissors, a few sheets 
of coloured silk paper, and some water 
colours, with the following dyes ; 

1916. To DYE FEATHERS BLUE. 
Into two pennyworths of oil of vitriol, 
mix two pennyworths of the best indi 
go in powder; let it stand a day or two; 
when wanted shake it well, and into a 
quart of boiling water put one table- 
spoonful of the liquid. Stir it well, put 
the feathers in, and let them simmer 
a few minutes.- (See 419.) 

1917 YELLOW. Put a tablespoonful 
of the best turmeric into a quart of 
boiling water ; when well mixed put in 
the feathers. More or less of the tur- 
meric will give them different shades, 
and a very small quantity of soda will 
give them an orange hue. (See 423.) 

1918. GREEN. Mix the indigo liquid 
with turmeric, and pour boiling water 
over it ; let the feathers simmer in the 
dye until they have acquired the shade 
you want them. 

1919. PINK. Three good pink sau- 
cers in a quart of boiling water, with a 
small quantity of cream of tartar. If 
a deep colour is required, use four sau 
cers. Let the feathers remain in the 
dye several hours. 

1920. RED. Into a quart of boiling 
water dissolve a teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar, put in one taoleRpoonful of pre- 
pared cochineal, and then a few drops 
of muriate of tin. This dye is expen- 
sive, and scarlet flowers are best made 
with the plumage of the red Ibis, which 
can generally be had of a bird-fancier 
or bird-stuffer, who will give directions 
how it may be applied. 

1921. LILAC. About two teaspoon- 
fuls of cudbear, into about a quart of 
boiling- water ; let it simmer a few 
minutes before you put in thb fcathers 
A small quantity of cream of tartar 
turns the color from lilac to amethyst.

MORNING IS WELCOME TO TIIK INDUSTRIOUS. 



( See 420. ) Read the general instruc- 
tions upon Dyeing (402.) 

1923. BEFORE THE FEATIIFRS ARE 
DYED they must be put into Lot water, 
and let them drain before they are put 
into the dyes. After they are taken 
out of the dye, rinse them two or three 
times in clear cold water (except the 
red), which must only be done once. 
Then lay them on a tray, over which a 
cloth has been spread, before a good 
fire ; when they begin to dry and un- 
fold draw each feather gently between 
your thumb and finger, until it regains 
its proper shape. 

1924. THE LEAVES OF THE FLOW- 
ERS are made of green feathers, cut 
like those of the natural flower, and 
serrated at the edge with a very small 
pair of scissors. For the calix of a 
moss-rose the down is left on the feath- 
er, and is a very good representation of 
the moss on the natural flower. 

1925. COLLECTING AND LAY- 
ING OUT SEA- WEEDS. First 
wash the sea-weed in fresh water, then 
take a plate or dish (the larger the bet- 
ter), cut your paper to the size required, 
place it on the plate with fresh water, 
and spread out the plant with a good- 
sized camel-hair pencil in a natural 
form (picking out with the pin gives 
the sea-weed an unnatural appearance, 
and destroys the characteristic fall of 
the branches, which should be carefully 
avoided) ; then gently raise the paper 
with the specimen out of the water, 
placing it in a slanting position for a 
few moments, so as to allow the super- 
abundant water to run off; after which 
place it in the press. The press is made 
with either three pieces of board or 
paste-board. Lay on the first board 
two sheets of blotting-paper; on that 
lay your specimens ; 'place straight and 
smooth over them a piece of old muslin, 
fine cambric, or linen ; then some more 
blotting-paper, and place another board 
on the top of that, and continue in the 
game way. The blotting-paper and the 
muslin should be carefully removed 
and dried every day, am 1 , then replaced; 
at fhe same tiuia those specimens tha 4 > 



are sufficiently dried may be taken 
away. Nothing now remains but tt 
write on. each the name, date, and lo- 
cality. You can iither gum the epeci- 
mens in a scrap-book, or fix them in, 
as drawings are often fastened, by 
making four slits in the page, and in- 
serting each corner. This is by far the 
best plan, as it admits of their removal, 
without injury to the page, at any 
future period, if it be required either 
to insert better specimens, or interme- 
diate species. Some of the larger Algae 
will not adhere to the paper, and conse- 
quently require gumming. The follow- 
ing method of preserving them has 
been communicated tome by a botanical 
friend: "After well cleaning and 
pressing, brush the coarser kinds of 
Algae over with spirits of turpentine, 
in which two or three small lumps of 
gum mastic have been dissolved, by 
shaking in a warm place ; two-thirds ot 
a small phial is the proper proportion, 
and this will make the specimens retain 
a fresh appearance. 

1926. DRY BOTANICAL SPECI- 
MENS FOR PRESERVATION. 
The plants you wish to preserve should 
be gathered when the weather is dry, 
and after placing the ends in water, let 
them remain in a cool place till the next 
day. When about to be submitted to 
the process of drying, place each plant 
between several sheets of blotting- 
paper, and iron it with a large smooth 
heater, pretty strongly warmed, till all 
the moisture is dissipated. Colours 
may thus be fixed, which otherwise be- 
come pale, or nearly white. Some 
plants require more moderate heat than 
others, and herein consists the nicety 
of the experiment : but I have gene- 
rally found, that if the iron be not too 
hot, and is passed rapidly, yet carefully, 
over the surface of the blotting-paper, 
it answers the purpose equally well 
with plants of almost every variety 
of hue and thickness. In compound 
flowers, with those also of a stubborn 
and solid form, as the Centaurea, some 
little art is required in cutting away the 
under part, by which means the profile 



SLEEP FALLS SWEETLY UPON THE TIRTUOUS. 



225 



and forms of the flowers will be more 
distinctly exhibited. This is especially 
necessary, when the method employed 
by Major Velley is adopted : viz., to fix 
the flowers and fructification down with 
gum upon the paper previous to ironing, 
by" which means they become almost 
incorporated with the surface. When 
this very delicate process is attempted, 
blotting-paper should be laid under 
every part excepting the blossoms, in 
order to prevent staining the white 
paper. Great care must be taken to 
keep preserved specimens in a dry place. 
19*7. SKELETON LEAVES may 
be made by steepiag leaves in rain 
water, in an open vessel, exposed to the 
air and sun. Water must occasionally 
be added to compensate loss by evapo- 
ration. The leaves will putrefy, and 
then their membranes will begin to 
open ; then lay them on a clean white 
plate, filled with clean water, and with 
gentle touches take off the external 
membranes, separating them cautiously 
near the middle rib. V/hen there is an 
opening towards the latter the whole 
membrane separates easily. The pro- 
cess requires a great deal of patience, as 
ample time must be given for the vege- 
table tissues to decay, and separate 

1928. A MORE EXPEDITIOUS METH- 
OD. A table-spoonful of chloride of lime 
in a liquid state, mixed with a quart of 
pure spring water. Leaves or seed- 
cessels of plants to be soaked in the 
n'ixture for about four hours, then 
taken out and well washed in a large 
bason filled with water, after which, 
they should be left to dry with free 
exposure to light and air. Some of the 
larger species of forest leaves, or such 
as have strong ribs, will require to be 
left rather more than four hours in the 
liquid. 

19-29. DWARF PLANTS. Take a 
cutting of the plant you wish to dwarf, 
say a uvjrtle, for instance, and having 
Bet it in a pot. wait until you are 
satisfied that it has taken root ; then 
take a cutting from it, and place it in a 
miniature flower-pot, taking care to fill 
It more tl an three parts with fino sand 



the remainder with mould. Put it under 
a glass, on the chimney-piece, or in any 
warm place, and give it very small 
quantities of water. 

1930. PRESERVE FUNGI. Re- 
ceipt of the celebrated botanist, William 
Withering-, Esq., by which specimens 
of fungi may be beautifully preserved. 
Take two ounces of sulphate of cop- 
per, or blue vitriol, and reduce it to 
powder, and pour upon it a pint of 
boiling Water, and when cold, add half 
a pint of spirits of wine ; cork it well, 

.11. ,1 rtoll i4- * 4 * " T^rv A i<r lit 



and call it "the pickle." To eight 
pintd of water add one pint and a-half 
of spirits of wine, and call it " the 
liquor." Be provided with a number 
of wide-mouthed bottles of different 
sizes, all well fitted with corks. The 
fungi should be left on the table as 
long as possible, to allow the moisture 
to evaporate ; they should then be 
placed in the pickle for three hours, or 
longer, if necessary ; then place them 
in the bottles intended for their re 
ception, and fill with the liquor. 1 hey 
should then be well corked and sealed, 
and arranged in order with their names 
in front of the bottles. 

1931. MODELLING IN CORK, 
GUTTA PERCHA, LEATHER, PA- 
PER, PLASTER OF PARIS, WAX, 
WOOD, &c. Modelling, in a general 
sense, signifies the art of constructing 
an original pattern, which is to be ulti- 
mately carried out on an enlarged 
scale, or copied exactly. 

1932. When models are constructed 
to give a miniature representation of 
any great work, elevation, or topogra- 
phical information, they are executed in 
detail, with all the original parts in just 
and due proportions, so that the work 
may be conducted or comprehended 
better; and if the model is a scientific 
one, viz., relating to machinery, physi- 
cal science, &c., then it requires to be 
even still more accurate in its details. 
In fact, all models should be con- 
structed on a scale which should be ap- 
pended to them, so that a better idea 
may be obtained of the proportions and 
dimensions. 



220 



AN EVIL CONSCIENCE IS THE GREATEST PLAQUE. 



1933. In the earliest ages, modelling 
in clay which was sometimes subse- 
quently coated with wax was much 
practised : afterwards sculpture suc- 
ceeded ; but it still depended on model- 
ling in a measure, as it now does, for 
its excellence. Few, indeed, of our 
great works of art are executed without 
some kind of a model in addition to the 
design we had almost written, none ; 
but we know that statues and reliefs 
have been executed without any other 
aid than that furnished by the design 
alone. 

1934. The most celebrated models of 
modern, and we believe surpassing any 
of former times, are M. Bruuetti's 
" Ancient Jerusalem," Mr. E. Smith's 
" Modern Jerusalem," both of them ex- 
amples worthy of being imitated, 
whether for the excellence of the work, 
the faithfulness of the model, or the 
patience and scientific knowledge dis- 
played in their construction. 

1935. THE MATERIAL REQUIRED are 
plaster of Paris, wax, whiting, putty, 
clay, pipe-clay; common and factory 
cinders ; sand of various colours ; pow- 
dered fluor spar, oyster-shells, bricks, 
slate, cinders, and glass ; gums, acacia 
and tragacanth ; starch ; paper white 
and brown, cardboard and millboard; 
cork sheets, cork raspings, and old bot- 
tle corks; gutta percha; leather and 
leather chips ; wood ; paints, oil, wr.ter, 
and varnish ; moss, lichen, ferns, and 
grass ; talc, window and looking-glass; 
rnusiin and net ; chenille ; carded wool ; 
tow ; wire ; hay and straw ; various 
varnishes, A glue, and cements. 

1936. THE TOOLS consist of brushes for 
paints, varnishes, and cements ; two or 
three bradawls ; a sharp penknife ; a 
chisel, hammer and punches ; scissors ; 
and pencil. 

1937. CAVES maybe readily modelled 
in cork, wood, starch-paste, or cinders 
covered with brown paper soaked in 
thin glue. 

1938. TO CONSTRUCT THEM OF ClN- 

DERS. A .'range the cinders, whetner 
common or factory, in such a manner 
as to resemble the intended design ; 



then cover such parts as require it 
with brown paper soaked in thin glue 
until quite pulpy. When nearly dry, 
dust over with sand, powdered briek, 
slate, and chopped lichen or moss, from 
a pepper-box ; touch up the various 
parts with either oil, water, or varnish 
colours ; and if necessary, form your 
trees of wire covered with brown paper, 
and moss glued on. 

1939. When a cave is constructed in 
the way we have pointed out, on a 
large scale, and the interior sprinkled 
with powdered fluor spar or glass, the 
eifect is very good by candle-light. 

1940. STALACTITES may be repre- 
sented by rough pieces of wood, which 
must be smeared with glue, and spri/v- 
kled with powdered fluor spar, ve 
glass. 

1941. To MODEL CAVES IN CORK. - 
Construct the frame-work of wood, wi4 
fill up the outline with old be Tie- 
corks. The various projections. le 
cesses, and other minutiae, mu/^, b 
affixed afterwards with glue, after "jeing 
formed of cork, or hollowed out w the 
necessary parts, either by burnin-/ with 
a hot wira and scraping it after'; cards, 
or by means of a sharp-pointed brad- 
awl. 

1942. If small cork models a?e con- 
structed, the trees should be ionned 
by transfixing short pieces of i.-haded 
chenille with a fine wire (.), and slicking 
them into the cork. 

1943. Various parts of the model 
must be touched up with oil, water, or 
varnish colours ; and powdered brick, 
slate, and chopped lichen or moss, 
dusted on as usual. 

1944. Wooden models are constructed 
roughly in deal, according to the proper 
design, and the various fine parts after- 
wards affixed with glue or brads. 

1945. In forming the finer parts of 
the wooden model, a vast amount of 
unnecessary labour may be saved, and a 
better effect obtained, by burning much 
of the outline instead of carving it. By 
this plan deeper tones of colouring, 
facility of operating, and saving of tim* 
and labour, are the result. 



LET 1TOPE BE OUR HANDMAID. 



227 



1046. In common with other models 
those constructed of wood, require th* 
aid of lichen, moss, powdered slate, &c. 
and colours, to complete the effect. 

1947. When water issues from the 
original cave, and it is desirable to copy 
it in the model, a piece of looking-glass 
should be glued on the stand, and the 
edges surrounded by glue, and paper 
covered with sand. Sometimes it ie re- 
quisite to cutaway the wood of the stand 
so as to let in the looking-glass ; this. 
however, is only when the water is sup- 
posed to be much lower than the surface 
of the land. 

1948.NSfarcA paste models are formed 
in the usual way of the following com- 
position : Soak gum tragacanth in 
water, and when soft, mix it with pow- 
dered starch till of a proper consistence. 
It is much improved by adding some 
double-refined sugar finely powdered. 
When the model is finished, it must be 
coloured correctly, and varnished with 
white varnish, or left plain. This is the 
composition used by confectioners for 
modelling the various ornaments on 
cakes. 

1949. ANCIENT CITIES, may be con- 
structed of cork or starch paste, in the 
same manner as directed above ; bearing 
in mind the necessity for always working 
models according to a scale, which 
should be afterwards affixed to the stand 
of the model. 

1950. MODERN CITIES, are better 
made of cardboard, starch-paste, or 
pipe-clay ; the houses, public buildings, 
and other parts being constructed ac- 
cording to scale. 

1951. Houses should be cut out of a 
long, thin strip of cardboard, partially 
divided by three strokes of a penknife, 
and glued together; this must after- 
wards be marked with a pencil, or pen 
and ink. to represent the windows, 
doors, stones, &c. ; and the roof cut 
out of a piece of square cardboard 
equally and partially divided is then to 
be glued on, and the chimney formed 
of a piece of lucifer-match, or wood 
Botched at one end and flat at the other 
- 4s to be glued on. A square piece 

10* ' 



of cardboard must be glued on the top 
of the chimney ; a hole made with a 
pin in the card and wood ; and a piece 
of grey worsted, thinned at the end, 
fixed into the hole for smoke. 

1952. Cathedrals, Churches and other 
public buildings are made in the same 
way ; only requiring the addition of 
small chips of wood, ends of lucifef 
matches, cork raspings, or small piece 
of cardboard, for the various ornaments 
if on a lage scale, but only a pencil 
mark if small. 

1953. When constructed of starch- 
paste, or pipe-clay, the material is 
rolled flat on a table or marble slab, and 
the various sides cut out with a sharp 
penknife ; they are then gummed to- 
gether, and coloured properly. 

1954. If large models of houses or 
buildings are made, the windows are 
constructed of talc or thin glass, cov- 
ered with net or muslin. The frame* 
of the windows are made of cardboard, 
neatly cut out with a sharp penknife. 

1955. COUNTRIES should De made of 
cork, because it is easier to work. Al- 
though the starch-paste is very agree- 
able to model with, yet it is liable to 
shrink, and therefore* when in the mass 
one part dries quicker than another, so 
that there is not equal contraction a 
great objection to its employment in 
accurate models. Cork on the contra- 
ry, may be easily cut into all forms, and 
from abounding with pores it is remark- 
ably light no little consideration to 
travellers. 

1956. TOPOGRAPHICAL models may, 
however, be formed of plaster of Paris, 
out the weight is an objection. We 
aave lately constructed a model of a 
country on a moderate scale one eighth 
of an inch to a square mile with its 
mountains, valleys, and towns, and it 
was done in this manner: a mode 
ivas first made in clay, according to 
cale and plan ; a mould was taken of 

various parts in gutta percha, rendered 
ioft by dipping it into hot water, and 
he parts cast in paper cement. 

1957. PAPER CEMENT. 1. Reduce 
>aper to a smooth paste by boiling it to 



228 



LET T1UTH r.E OUR GUIDE, 



water; then add an equal weight each 
of sifted whiting land good size ; boil to 
a proper consistence, and use. 

11)58. 2. Take equal parts of paper, 
paste, and size, sufficient finely powder- 
ed plaster of Paris to make into a good 
paste, and use as soon as possible after 
it is mixed. This composition may be 
used to cust architectural ornaments, 
busts, statues, &c,, being very light, 
and receiving a good polish, but it will 
not stand weather. 

1959. The several mountains and 
other parts being formed, we join them 
together in their proper places with 
Borne of the No. 1. paper cement, ren- 
dered rather more fluid by the addition 
of a little thin glue. The towns were 
made of a piece of cork, cut and 
scratched to the form of the town; 
steeples of cardboard, and trees of 
blades of moss. Sand was sprinkled 
in one part ; looking-glass in others, for 
the lakes, bays, and rivers ; and green 
baize flock for the verdant fields. 

1960. MONUMENTS, ancient or mod- 
ern, are better constructed of cork, on 
account of the lightness and facility in 
working, the more especially the an- 
cient ones. We once constructed a 
model of the Acropolis of Athens in 
cork, which was completed in one-fifth 
the time occupied by other materials, 
and looked much better; and have 
lately been at work upon others rep- 
resenting the ancient monuments of 
Egypt. 

1961. CITIES AND TEMPLES. We 
will suppose that the model is to repre- 
sent the Temple of Theseus, at Athens, 
which was built by Cimon, the son of 
Miltiades. In the first place we must 
obtain the necessary dimensions, and 
then reducing the number of feet to 
fractional parts of an inch, form a scale 
suitable for carrying out the whole. 
A piece of wood of the necessary size 
is procured, the plan marked out in 
pencil, and the ground on which it 
stands imitated in cork; by cutting 
away the parts that are not required, 
with a sharp penknife and addirg others 
with glue. The flc >r or the temple is 



now to be glued on with common glue, 
for we should remark that the liquid 
glue does not dry quick enough for 
cork modelling, and is not sc good as 
the old plan ; the sides and ends are 
formed of cork sheets, marked with a 
i?ad-pencil to represent the blocks of 
stone ; and ruined and broken parts 
imitated, by pricking the cork with a 
blunt penknife or needle. The frieze 
representing the battle between the 
Centaar and Lapithae, and the metopes 
in mezzo-relievo, containing a mixture 
of the labours of Hercules and Theseus, 
should be drawn upon the sheets of 
cork according to scale, and coloured 
with a little lamp-black and raw sienna, 
to represent the subject intended. If 
the scale is small, or if the model ad- 
mits of it, the groups may be neatly 
carved with a sharp penknife from the 
cork, which has been previously out- 
lined with a pencil. The next thing we 
shall have to do, is to strengthen the 
interior of the model, and this is done 
by glueing small pieces of cork, at ir- 
regular intervals at the angles formed 
by the junction of any parts ; these are 
put on the inside, and lastly, the roof 
is affixed. Any parts that require to be 
coloured, must be touched up with 
varnish or water colours, and lichen, 
&c., affixed with mucilage where it is 
requisite. 

1962. TO MODEL FROM LIVING OB- 
JECTS. We will imagine that the 
reader desires to model the features of 
some friend, and as there is some diffi- 
culty in the matter, on account of the 
person operated upon having a natural 
tendency to distort the features when 
the liquid plaster is poured upon the 
face, and some danger of suffocation if 
the matter is not well managed, we 
will proceed at once to describe the 
various stages of operating : 

1963. Mix the plaster of Paris with 
warm water, and have it about as thick 
as cream, but do not mix it until all is 
ready. Lay the friend upon his back, 
and having raised the head to the nat- 
ural position when walking, by means 
of a pillow of bran or sand, cover the 



AND FAITH BE OUR STAFF. 



229 



the parts intended to be cast with oil 
of almonds or olives, applied by means 
of a leather, brush, or lump of cotton ; 
plug the ears with cotton or wool, and 
insert two quills into the nostrils, and 
plug the space between each quill 
and the nostril very carefully with 
cotton. 

1964. Corer the face with the plaster, 
beginning at the upper part of the fore- 
bead, and spread it downwards, over 
the eyes, which should be kept firmly 
closed, but in such a manner as not to 
produce any distortion by too violent 
compression and continue the plaster 
as far as the lower border of the chin; 
cover that part of the chest and arms 
that is to be represented, and carry 
the plaster upwards, so as to join the 
cast of the face ; then carefully remove 
each, and season for casting, by soaking 
or brushing with linseed oil boiled with 
sugar of lead or litharge. Some per- 
sons boil the moulds in the oil ; and 
many, instead ef casting the face in 
one piece, and the chest in another, lay 
threads acr^a- the face and up and 
down it, leaving the ends out. As the 
plaster sets, or is nearly set, the threads 
are pulled through, so as to divide the 
cast into four, five, or more pieces. 

1965. The back part of the head is 
moulded by having an oval trencher- 
sort of vessel, deeper than half the 
head, and generally made of plaster, 
and boiled in oil. The back of the 
head being oiled, and this trencher 
partially filled with liquid plaster of 
Paris, the head is lowered into it, and 
the cast taken. The back of the neck 
is cast with the person turned over on 
bis face. 

1966. Each part of the mould is 
marked, so as to admit of its corre- 
sponding; sometimes with an X or ||, 
which passing over the junction of two 
pieces, serves to distinguish them. 

1967. To model the face, join the 
novei-al pieces, and tie them together 
with twine ; then wrap some rag round 
the joints to prevent the plaster oozing 
out, and pour in the plaster made 
tolerably fluid, taking care to oil the 



inside of the mould very carefully first. 
When the outer part of the model is 
nearly set, scoop out the centre with a 
spoon, and let the whole dry ; then 
remove the strings, &c., and smooth off 
the edges of the joints upon the model 
with a sharp penknife, and carve out 
the eyes from the mass, otherwise they 
will appear as if closed. 

1968. Wax models may be rnad 
from the moulds used for the plaster ; 
but when the wax sets at the outside 
to about one-eighth of an inch, the rest 
should be poured out of the mould ; or, 
a smaller portion being poured in, it 
may be shaken about the inside of the 
mould until it is coated. The pieces 
are removed, and the seams trimmed 
up, as in the plaster cast. 

1969. If a cast be made in gutta 
percha from the model in plaster or, 
what is still better, in fusible metal, 
then by pressing basil leather, moistened 
with water, into the mould, and 
strengthening the back and centre with 
chips of wood, affixed by liquid glue, 
a very nice model may be obtained in 
leather, which, when varnished, will 
look like oak carving the more es- 
pecially if it be stained with Stephens' 
Oak Stain. 

1970. RUINS should be constructed 
of cork, according to the directions we 
have given, and when it is necessary to 
represent the mouldering walls covered 
with moss or ivy, a little green baize 
flock, or moss drippings, should be 
attached by mucilage to the part ; and 
oftentimes a brush of raw sienna, com- 
bined with varnish, requires to be laid 
underneath the moss or flock, in order 
to improve the effect. Prostrate columns 
and huge blocks are effectively repre- 
sented in cork, and should be neatly 
cut out with a sharp knife, and the 
various parts supposed to be destroyed 
by age, picked away with a pin or blunt 
knife afterwards. 

1971. RUSTIC WORK, SEATS, &c. , may 
be constructed of wire twisted to the 
proper shape and size, and then covered 
with gutta percha, rendered soft by 
being flipped in hot wator. The gutta 



230 



THRIVE BY HONESTY, OR. RKMATX POOH. 



percha whould be twisted round the 
wire previously warmed, and gently 
heated over a spirit lamp, or dipped 
again into hot water, so as to allow the 
various parts to be covered with it. 
When the model is finished, it should 
be touched up here and there with oil 
colours green, yellow, sienna, and Ve- 
netian red according to fancy, and the 
effect produced will be very good. 
1 172. B A KING, BOILING, BROIL- 
NG, FRYING, ROASTING, STEW- 
ING, and SPOILING. A DIALOGUE 
between the DUTCH OVEN, the SAUCE- 
PAN, the SPIT, the GRIDIRON, and the 
FRYIXG-PAX, with reflections thereupon, 
in which all housekeepers and cooks 
are invited to take an interest. 

1973. We were once standing by our 
scullery, when all of a sudden we 
heard a tremendous clash and jingle 
the Saucepan had tumbled into the 
Frying-pan : the Frying-pan had shot 
its handle through the ribs of the Grid- 
iron ; the Gridiron had bestowed a ter 
rible thump upon the hollow head of 
the Dutch-oven ; and the Spit had dealt 
a very skilful stroke, which shook the 
sides of all the combatants, and made 
them ring out the noises by which we 
were startled. Musing upon this inci- 
dent, we fancied that we overheard the 
following dialogue : 

1974. FRYING-PAN. Hallo, Sauce- 
pan ! what are you doing here, with 
your dropsical corporation ? 

time that you were superannuated ; 
you are a mere meat- spoiler. You 
adulterate the juices of the best joint, 
and give to the stomach of our master 
little else" than watery compounds to 
digest. 

1975. SAUCEPAN. Well ! I like your 
conceit ! You who harden the fibre of 
flesh so much, that there is no telling 
whether a steak came from a bullock, a 
horse, or a bear ! who can't fry a slice 
of potato, or a miserable smelt, but you 
must be flooded with oil or fat, to keep 
your spitemJ nature from burning or 
bitiug t^e morsel our master should 
enjoy. Not only that you open your 
mouth ec wide, that the soot pf the 



chimney drops in, nnd frequently spoili 
our master's dinner; or you throw the 
fat over your sides, and set the chimney 
in a blaze. 

1976. SPIT. Go on ! go on ! six 
one, and half-a-dozen the other. 

1977. DUTCH-OVEN Well, Mr. Spit, 
you needn't try to foment the quarrel. 
You require more attention than any 
of us ; for if you are not continually 
watched, and helped by that useful 
little attendant of yours they call a 
Jack, your lazy, lanky figure would 
stand still, and you would expose the 
most delicious joint to the ravages of 
the fire. In fact, you need not only a, 
Jack to keep you going, but a cook to 
constantly baste the joint confided to 
your care, without which our master 
would have but a dry bone to pick. 
Not only so, but you thrust your spear- 
like length through the best meat, and 
make an unsightly gash in a joint which 
otherwise might be an ornament to the 
table. 

1978. SPIT. What, Dutch oven, is 
that you ? venerable old sobersides, witli 
a hood like a monk ! Why, you are a 
mere dummy as you are placed so you 
remain ; there you stand in one place, 
gaping wide and catching the coals as 
they fall ; if you w r ere not well watched, 
you would burn the one half, and sod- 
den the other, of whatever you were re- 
quired to prepare. Bad luck to your 

Quite impertinence! 

1979. GRIDIRON. Peace! Peace! We 
all have our merits and our demerits, 
At this remark of the Gridiron, therfr 
was a general ehout of laughter. 

1980. SAUCEPAN. Well, I declare, I 
never thought that I should have my 
merits classed with those of the miser- 
able skeleton called a Gridiron. That 
is a joke ! A thing with six ribs and a 
( tail to compare with so useful a mam 
her of the cuisine community as my 
self! Why you, Gridiron, waste onn 
half of the goodness of the meat in the 
fire, and the other half you send to the 
table tainted with smoke, and burnt to 
cinders ! A loud rattle of approbation 
went round, as the poor Gridiron telJ 



PEOPLE ARE THE MOST MODEST.

under this torrent of derision from the 
Saucepan. 

1981. Coming away from the scene 
!>f contusion, I ordered the scullerymaid 
to go instantly and place each of the 
utensils that lay in disorder upon the 
ground, into its proper place, ctiarging 
her to cleanse each carefully, until it 
should be required for use. 

1982. Returning 1 to my library I 
thought it would form no mean oc- 
cupation were I to spend a fevr hours 
iu reflection upon the relative claims of 
the disputants. I did BO, and the fol- 
lowing is the result : 

1983. THE GRIDIRON. The Gridiron, 
though the simplest of cooking instru- 
ments, is by j^ means to be despised. 
The Gridiron, as indeed all cooking 
utensils, should be kept scrupulously 
clean ; and when it is used, the bars 
should be allowed to get warm before 
the meat is placed upon it, otherwise 
the parts crossed by the bars will be 
insufficiently dressed. The fire should 
be sharp, clear, and free from smoke. 
The heat soon forms a film upon the 
surface of the meat, by which the 
juices are retained. Chops and steaks 
should not be too thick nor too thin. 
From a half to three-quarters of an inch 
is the proper thickness. Avoid thrust- 
ing the fork into 1 he meat, by which 
you release the juice. There is a de- 
scription of Gridiron iu which the bars 
are grooved to catch the juice of the 
meat ; but a much better invention is 
the upright Gridiron, which is attached 
to the front of the grate, and has a pan 
at the bottom to catch the gravy. Kid- 
neys, rashers, &c., dressed in this man- 
ner will be found delicious. There are 
some, however, vrho think that the 
dressing of meat over the fire secures a 
flavour which cannot otherwise be ob- 
tained. Keme'inber that the Gridiron is 
devoted to the cooking of small dishes, 
or snacks, for breakfast, supper, and 
luncheon, and is therefore a most useful 
servant, ready at a moment's notice. 
Remember, also, that every moment 
which is lost, aftei the Gridiron has 
delivered up his cl:arge ui a deUy to 



the prejudice of the Gridiron. From 
the Gridiron to the table without loss 
of time should be the rule. (See 239.) 

1984. THE FRYING-PAN is less a 
favourite, in our estimation, than tb 
Gridiron; but not to be despised, never- 
theless. He is a noisy and a greasy 
servant, requiring much watchfulness. 
Like the Gridiron, the Frying-pan re- 
quires a clear, but not a large fire, and 
the pan should be allowed- to get 
thoroughly hot, and be well covered with 
fat, before meat is put into it. The ex- 
cellence of frying very much depends 
upon the sweetness of the oil, butter, 
lard, or fat, that may be employed. The 
Frying-pan is very useful in the warming 
of cold vegetables and other kinds of 
food, and, in ^his respect, may be 
considered a real friend of economy. 
All know the relish afforded by a 
pancake a treat which the Gridiron 
would be unable to afford us. To say 
nothing of eggs and bacon, and various 
kinds of fish, to which both the Sauce 
pan and the Gridiron are quite unsuited, 
because they require that which is the 
essence of frying, boiling and browning 
in fat. (See 239.) 

1985. THE SPIT is a very noble and 
a very useful implement of cookery, as 
ancient, we presume, as he is straight- 
forward at his work. Perhaps the pro- 
cess of roasting stands only second in 
the rank of excellence in Cookery. Tha 
process is perfectly sound in its chemi- 
cal effects upon the food ; while the 
joint is kept so immediately under the 
eye of the cook, that it must be the 
fault of that functionary if the joint 
does not go to the table in the highest 
state of perfection. The process may 
be commenced very gradually, by the 
joint being kept a good distance from 
the fire, and gradually brought forward, 
until it is thoroughly soaked within 
and browned without. The Spit has 
this advantage over the Oven, and espe- 
cially over the common oven, that the 
meat retains its own flavour, not having 
to encounter the evaporation from fifty 
different dishes, and that the steam 
from its own substan : passes entirely 



232 



NIGHT IS NOT DARK TO THE GOOD, 



away, leaving the essence of the meat 
in its prunest condition. (See 239, 598.) 
l!t>(3. TUE DUTCH OVEN, though not 
so royal an instrument as the Spit, is, 
nevertheless, of great utility for small 
dishes of various kinds, which the Spit 
would spoil by the magnitude of its 
operations, or the oven destroy by the 
severity of its heat. It combines, in 
fact, the advantages of roasting and 
baking, and may be adopted for com- 
pound dishes, and for warming cold 
scraps. It is easily heated, and causes 
no material expenditure of fuel. 
(See 238). 

1987. THE SAUCEPAN. When we 
come to speak of the Saucepan, we have 
to consider the claims of a very large, 
ancient, and useful family ; and perhaps, 
looking at the generic orders of the 
Saucepan, all other cooking implements 
must yield to its claims. There are 
large saucepans, which we dignify with 
the name of boilers, and small sauce- 
pans, which come under the denomina- 
tion of stew-pans. There are few kinds 
of meat or fish which it will not re- 
ceive, and dispose of in a satisfactory 
manner ; and few vegetables for which 
its modus opcrandi is not adapted. The 
Saucepan, rightly used, is a very econo- 
mical servant, allowing- nothing- to be 
lost ; that which escapes from the meat 
while in its charge forms broth, or may 
be made the uase of soups. Fat rises 
upon the surface of the water, and may 
be skimmed off; while in various stews 
it combines, in an eminent degree, 
what we may term the fragrance of 
cookery, and the piquancy of taste. 
The French are perfect masters of the 
use of the Stew-pan. And we shall 
find that, as all cookery is but an aid to 
digestion, the operations of the Stew- 
pan resemble the actku of the stomach 
very closely. Th-e stomach is a close 
sac, in which solids and flajds are mixed 
together, macerated in the gastric juice, 
and dissolved by the aid of heat and 
motion, occasioned by th-3 continual 
contractions and relaxations of the coats 
f the stomach during the action of 
digestion TJiis is more cjoselv resem- 



bled by the process of stewing than by 
any other of our culinary methods. 
(See 239, 590.) 

1988. In this rapid review of the 
claims of various cooking utensils, we 
think that we have done justice to each. 
They all have their respective advan- 
tages; besides which, they contribute 
to the VARIETY presented by our tables, 
without which the routine of eating 
would be very monotonous and unsatis- 
factory. 

1989. There is one process to which 
we must yet allude the process of 
SPOILING. Many cooks know how to 
produce a good dish, but too many of 
them know how to spoil it. They 
leave fifty things to be done just at the 
critical moment when the chief dish 
should be watched with an eye of keen- 
ness, and attended by a hand thoroughly 
expert. Having spent three hours in 
making a joint hot and rich, they forget 
that a quarter of an hour, after it is 
taken from the fire, may impair or spoil 
all their labours. The serving-up of 
a dinner may be likened to the assault 
upon Sebastopol. Looking upon the 
joint as the Malakoff, and the sur- 
rounding dishes as the Redans, the bas- 
tions, and the forts, they should all be 
seized simultaneously, and made the 
prize of the commander-in-chief, and 
bis staff around the dinner-table. Such 
a victory will always do the cook the 
highest honour, and entitle him to the 
gratitude of the household. 

1990. WHY does a polished metal 
teapot make better tea than a black 
earthen one ? As polished metal is a 
very bad radiator of heat, it keeps the 
water hot much longer ; and the hotter 
;he water is, the better it "draws' 
the tea. 

1991. WHY will not a dull black 
;eapot make good tea? because the 
icat of the water flies off so quickly, 
;h rough the dull black surface of 
the teapot, that the water is very 
rapidly cooled, and cannot " draw " the 
;ea. 

1992. Do not pensioners, anci aged 
cottagers, generally prefer the 



NOR IS DAY BRIGHT TO THE WICKED. 



233 



earthen teapot to the bright metal one ? 
Yes, because they set it on the bob 
to "draw;" in which case, the little 
black teapot will make the best tea. 

1993. WHY will a black teapot m&ke 
better tea than a bright metal one, if 
it is set upon the hob to draw ? lie- 
cause the black teapot will absorb heat 
plentifully from the fire, and keeps the 
water hot; whereas a bright metal 
teapot (set upon the hob) would 
throw off the heat by reflection. 

1994. THEN sometimes a black 
earthen teapot is the best, and some- 
times a bright metal one? Yes; when 
the teapot is set on the hob to " draw," 
the black earth is the best, because it 
absorbs heat; but when the teapot is 
not set on the hob, the bright metal is 
the best, because it radiates heat very 
Blowly, and therefore keeps the water 
hot. 

1995.- WHY does a saucepan which 
has been used boil in a shorter time 
than a new one? Because the bottom 
and back are covered with soot, and 
the black soot rapidly absorbs the boat 
of the glowing coals. 

1996. WHY should the front and lid 
of a saucepan be clean and bright? 
As they do not come in contact with 
the fire, they cannot absorb heat, and 
(being bright) they will not suffer the 
heat to escape by radiation. 

1997. WHY s* aid not the bottom 
and back of n vettle be cleaned and 
polished? P cause they come in con- 
tact with the fire, and (while they are 
covered with black soot) absorb heat 
freely from the burning coals. 

1998. WHY are dinner covers made 
of bright tin or silver ? Because li^'at- 
coloured and highly-polished metal is a 
very bad radiator of heat ; and, there- 
fore, bright tin or silvei will not allow 
the heat of the cooked food to escape 
through the cover by radhition. 

1999. WHY should a meat cover be 
very brightly polished ? If the cover 
be dull or scratched, it will absorb beat 
from the food ; and instead of keeping 
it hot, will make it cold. 

2000 WHY should a silver meat- 



cover be plain, and not chased ? Be- 
cause, if the cover be chased, it will 
absorb heat from the food ; and instead 
of making it hot, will make it cold. 

2001. WHAT is the smoke of a candle? 
Solid particles of carbon, separated from 
the wick and tallow, but not con- 
surned. 

2002. WHY are some particles con- 
sumed and not others ? The com- 
bustion of the carbon depends upon its 
combining with the oxygen of the air. 
Now, as the outer surface of the flame 
prevents the access of air to the interior 
parts, much of the carbon of those parts 
passes off in smoke. 

2003. WHY do lamps smoke? Either 
because the wick is cut unevenly, or 
else because it is turned up too high. 

2004. WHY does a lamp smoke, when 
the wick is cut unevenly ? Because the 
points of the jagged edge (being very 
easily separated from the wick) load 
the flame with more carbon that it can 
consume ; and as the heat of the flame 
is greatly diminished by these little bits 
of wicks, it is unable to consume even 
the usual quantity of smoke. The same 
applies when the wick is turned up too 
high. 

2005. WHY does a lamp-glass diminish 
the smoke of a wick ? Because it 
increases the supply of oxygen to the 
flame, by producing- a draught ; and it 
concentrates and reflects the heat ot 
the flam* in consequence of which, 
the com! stion of the carbon is more 
perfect, a* d very little escapes uncon- 

sumed. (From No. to are 

quoted from " Dr. Brewer's Guide to 
Science" We have taken some care to 
extract the answers relating to domestic 
subjects. See 291.) 

2006. CAUTIONS FOR THE PRE- 
VENTION OF ACCIDENTS. The 
following regulations should be engraved 
on the memories of all ; 

2007. As most sudden deaths come by 
water, particular caution is therefore 
necessary in its vrcinity. 

2008. Stand not near a tree, or any 
leaden spout, iron gate, or palisade, iu 
time of lightning. 



234 



FOOLS HAVE AX AI;IM)AN\'K OF VANITi'. 



2009. Lay loaded guns in safe places 
and never imitate tiring a gun in jest. 

20 JO. Xever sleep near charcoal ; if 
drowsy at any work where charcoal 
fires are used, take the fresh air. 

2011. Carefully rope trees before they 
are cut down, that when they fall they 
may do no injury. 

20] 2. When benumbed with cold be- 
ware of sleeping out of doors ; rub 
yourself, if you have it in your power, 
with snow, and do not hastily approach 
the fire. 

2013. Beware of damps. 

2014. Air vaults, by letting them re- 
main open some time before you enter, 
or scattering pow r dered lime in them. 
Where a lighted candle will not burn, 
animal life cannot exist ; it will be an 
excellent caution, therefore, before en- 
tering damp and confined places, to try 
this simple experiment. 

2015. Never leave saddle or draught 
horses, while in use, by themselves ; 
nor go immediately behind a led horse 
as he is apt to kick. 

2016. Ride not on foot- ways. 

2017. Be wary of children, whether 
they are up or in bed ; and particularly 
when they are near the fire, an element 
with which they are very apt to amuse 
themselves 

2018. Leave nothing poisonous open 
ov accessible; and never omit to write the 
word "POISON"' in large letters upon it, 
wherever it may be placed. 

2019. In walking the stre .skeepout 
of the line of the cellars, and never 
look one way and walk another. 

2020. Never throw pieces of orange- 
peel, or 'broken glass bottles into the 
streets. 

2021 . Never meddle with gunpowder 
by candle-light. 

2022. In trimming a lamp with naph- 
tha, never fill it. Leave space for the 
spirit to expand with warmth. 

2023. Never quit a room leaving the 
poker in the fire. 

2024. When the bmss rod of the stair- 
carpet becomes loose, fasten it imme- 
diately. 

2025 In opening effervescing drinks, 



such as soda water, hold the cork in 
your hand. 

2026. Quit your house with care on n 
frosty morning. 

2027. Have your horses' shoes roughed 
directly there are indications of iro^r. 

2028. Keep lucifer matches in their 
cases, and never let them be strewed 
about. 

2029. BIRDLIME. Take any quan 
tity of linseed oil, say half a pint ; put 
it into an old pot, or any vessel that 
will stand the fire without breaking ; 
the vessel must not be more than one- 
third full, put it on a slow 7 fire, stir it 
occasionally until it thickens as much 
as required ; this will be known by 
cooling the stick in water, and trying it 
with the fingers. It is best to make it 
rather harder than for use. Then pour 
it into cold water. It can be brought 
back to the consistency required with a 
little Archangel tar. 

2030. RING W OEM. The head to 
be washed twice a day with soft soap 
and warm soft water ; whett dried, 
the places to be rubbed with a piece of 
linen rag dipped in ammonia from gas 
tar ; the patient should take a little 
sulphur and molasses, or some other gen- 
tle aperient, every morning ; brushes 
and combs should be washed -every day, 
and the ammonia kept tightly corked.

2032. LOVE'S TELEGRAPH If 
a gentleman wants a wife, he wears a ring 
on the first finger of the left hand ; if 
lie is engaged, he wears it on the second 
finger ; if married, on the third ; and 
on the fourth, if he never intends to be 
married. When a lady is not engaged, 
she we.irs a hoop or diamond on her 
first finger ; if engaged, on the second; 
if married, on the third ; and on the 
fourth, if she intends to die a maid. 
"When a gentleman presents a fan, 
flower, or trinket, to a lady with the 
left hand, this, on his part, is an over- 
ture of regard ; should she receive it 
with the left hand, it is considered as 
an acceptance of his esteem ; but if 
with the right hand it is a refusal of 
the offer. Thus, by a few simple 
tokens, explained by rule, the passion 
of love is expressed : and, through the 
medium of the telegraph, the most 
timid and diffident man may, without 
difficulty, communicate his sentiments 
of regard to a lady, and in case his 
offer should be refused, avoid expe- 
riencing the mortification of an explicit 
refusal. 

303:*. SLUGS and SNAILS are 
groat enemies to every kind of garden 
plant, whether flower or vegetable 
they wander in the night to feed, and 
return at day-lisrht to their haul * 



;he shortest and surest direction is, 
' rise early, catch them, and kill them." 
[f you are an early riser, you may cut 
hem off from their day retreats, or you 
may lay cabbage leaves about the 
ground, especially on the beds which 
they frequent. Every morning examine 
;hese leaves, and you will find a great 
many taking refuge beneath ; if they 
jlague you very much, search for their 
retreat, which you can find by their 
slimy track, and hunt there for them 
day by day ; lime and salt are very an- 
noying- to snails and slugs ; a pinch of 
salt kills them, and they will not 
;ouch fresh lime ; it is a common prac- 
ice to sprinkle lime over young crops, 
and along the edges of beds, about rows 
of peas and heans, lettuces and other 
vegetables; but when it has been on 
;he ground some days, or has been 
moistened by rain, it loses its strength. 
(See 1305, 1306.) 

2034. CATERPILLARS and APHIDES. 
A garden syringe or engine, with a cap 
on the pipe full of very minute holes, 
will wash away these disagreeable visit- 
ors very quickly. You must bring 
the pipe close to the plant, and pump 
hard, so as to have considerable force 
on, and the plant, however badly in- 
fested, will soon be cleared without re- 
ceiving any injury. Every time that 
you use the syringe or garden engine, 
you must immediately rake the earth 
under the trees, and kill the insects 
you have dislodged, or many will recov- 
er and climb up the stems of the 
plants. 

2035. GRUBS on orchard trees and 
gooseberry and currant bushes, will 
sometimes be sufficiently numerous 
to spoil a crop ; but, if a bonfire be 
made with dry sticks and weeds on the 
windward side of the orchard, so that 
the smoke may blow among the trees, 
you will destroy thousands ; for the 
grubs have such an objection to smoke, 
that very little of it makes them roll 
themselves up and fall off ; they must 
be swept up afterwards. 

2036. WASPS destroy a good deal oi 
fruit, but every pair of wasps killed iu 



236 



IP YOU DESir.E TO KNOW, DO NOT FEAR TO ASK. 



spring saves the trouble and annoyance 
of a swarm in autumn; it is necessary, 
however, to be very careful in any at- 
tempt upon a wasp, for its sting is pain- 
ful and lasting. In case of being stung, 
get the blue bag from the laundry, and 
rub it well into the wound as soon as 
possible. Later in the season, it is cus- 
tomary to hang vessels of beer, or 
water and sugar, in the fruit-trees, to 
entice them to drown themselves. 

2037. BUTTERFLIES and MOTHS, how- 
ever pretty, are the worst enemies one 
can have in a garden ; a single insect of 
this kind may deposit eggs enough to 
overrun a tree with caterpillars, there- 
fore they should be destroyed at any 
cost of trouble. The only moth that 
you must spare, is the common black 
and red one ; the grubs of this feed 
exclusively on grounsel, and are there- 
fore a valuable ally of the gardener. 

2038. EARWIGS are very destructive 
insects ; their favourite food is the 
petals of roses, pinks, dahlias, and 
other flowers. They may be caught by 
driving stakes into the ground, and 
placing on each an inverted flower-pot ; 
the earwigs W 7 ill climb up and take 
refuge under it, when they may be 
taken out and killed. Clean bowls of 
tobacco-pipes placed in like manner on 
the tops of smaller sticks are very good 
traps ; or very deep holes may be made 
in the ground with a crowbar, into 
these they will fall, and may be de- 
etroyed by boiling water. 

2039. TOADS are among the best 
friends the gardener has ; for they live 
almost exclusively on the most destruc- 
tive kinds of vermin. Unsightly, there- 
fore, though they may be, they should 
on all accounts be encouraged ; they 
ghould never be touched nor molested 
in any way ; on the contrary, places of 
shelter should be made for them, to 
which they may retire from the bum- 
ing heat of the sun. If you have none 
in your garden, it will be quite worth 
your while to search for thorn in your 
walks, and bring them home, taking 
care to handle them tenderly, for al- 
f.hough they havt' nei'^er the will nor 



the power to injure you, a very little 
rough treatment will injure them ; m 
cucumber or melon frame should b 
without one or two. 

2040. SMALL-POX MARKS. Mi 
Waddington lances the pustules with 
a needle, and thus allows the poisonous 
matter (which is the cause of the dis- 
figurement) to eveapc, and also orders 
the room to be kept dark. Mr. Wad- 
dington states that, during twelve years' 
practice, he has not known one case 
aut of twenty of a person being marked 
by the small- pox, when the above sim- 
ple expedient has been resorted to. 
(See 1018.) 

2041. VENTILATING BED- 
ROOMS. A sheet of finely-perforated 
zinc, substituted for a pane of glass in 
one of the upper squares of a chamber 
window, is the cheapest and best form 
of ventilator ; there should not be a 
bed-room without it. 

2042. GREASE SPOTS FROM 
SILK. Upon a deal table lay a piece 
of woollen cloth or baize, upon which 
lay smoothly the part stained, with the 
right side downwards. Having spread 
a piece of brown paper on the top, 
apply a flat-iron just hot enough to 
scorch the paper. About five or eight 
seconds is usually sufficient. Then rub 
the stained part briskly with a piece of 
cap-paper. (See 815.) 

2043. CLEAN WHITE OSTRICH 
FEATHERS. Four oz. of white soap, 
cut small, dissolved in four pints of 
water, rather hot, in a large basip ; 
make the solution into a lather, bj 
beating- it with birch rods, or wires 
Introduce the feathers, and rub well 
with the hands for five or six minutes. 
After this soaping, "wash in clean water, 
as hot as the hand can bear. Shake 
until dry. 

2044. INK STANDS. Very fre- 
quently, when logwood has been used 
in manufacturing ink, a reddish stain 
still remains, after the use of oxalic 
acid, as in the former directions. To 
remove it, procure a solution of the 
chloride of lime, and apply it in the 
same manner as directed for the oxalio

acid. (Sec 176, 177, 277, 502, and 
507.) 

2045. BALDNESS. The decoction 
of boxwood, successful in cases of bald- 
ness, is thus made : Take of the com- 
mon box, which grows in garden borders, 
stems and leaves four large handfub ; 
boil in three pints of water, in a closely- 
covered vessel, for a quarter of an hour, 
and let it stand in a covered earthen- 
ware jar for ten hours or more ; strain, 
ttnd add an ounce and a half of Eau de 
Cologne, or lavender water, to make it 
keep. The head should be well washed 
with this solution every morning. (See 
148, 149, and 169.) 

2046. TO DESTROY ANTS. 
Drop some quicklime on the mouth of 
their nest, and wash it in with boiling 
water ; or dissolve some camphor in 
spirits of wine, then mix with water, 
and pour into their haunts ; or tobacco 
water, which has been found effectual. 
They are averse to strong sceuts. 
Camphor will prevent their infesting a 
cupboard, or a sponge saturated with 
creosote. To prevent their climbing 
up trees, place a ring of tar about t'ae 
trunk, or a circle of rag moistened oc- 
casionally with creosote. 

2047. " BREACH OF PROMISE 
OF MARRIAGE. A verbai offer of 
marriage is sufficient whereon to grouud 
an action for breach of promise of 
marriage. The conduct of the suitor, 
subsequent to the breaking off the en- 
gagement, would weigh with the jury 
iu estimating damages. An action 
may be commenced although the gen- 
tleman is not married. The length of 
time which must elapse before action, 
must be reasonable. A lapse of three 
years or even half that time, without 
any attempt by the gentleman to renew 
the acquaintance, would lessen the 
damages very considerably perhaps io 
away with all chance of success, unless 
the delay could be satisfacto-ily ex- 
plained, The mode of proceeding is 
by an action at law. For this an 
attorney must be retained, who will 
manage the whole affair tc its termi- 
nation. 



2048. Before legal proceedings arc 
commenced, a letter should be written 
to the gentleman by the father or 
brother of the lady, requesting him to 
fulfil his engagement. A copy of thi" 
letter should be kept, and it had bettet 
be deli vered by some person who can 
prove that he did so, and that the copy 
is correct : he should make a memo- 
randum of any remarks or conver- 
sation. 

2049. We give an extract or two 
from the law authorities : they will, we 
have no doubt, be perused by our fair 
readers with great attention, and some 
satisfaction. " A man, who was paying 
particular attentions to a young girl, 
was asked by the father of the latter, 
after one of his visits, what his inten- 
tions were, and he replied, I have 
pledged my honour to marry the girl in 
a month after Christmas ;' and it was 
held that this declaration to the father, 
who had a right to make the inquiry, 
and to receive a true and correct an- 
swer, taken in connexion with the 
visits to the house, and the conduct of 
the young people towards each other, 
was sufficient evidence of a promise 
of marriage." 

2050. '* The common law does not 
altogether discountenance long engage- 
ments to be married. If parties are 
young, and circumstances exist, showing 
that the period during which they had 
agreed to remain single was not unrea- 
sonably long, the contract is binding 
upon them ; but if they are advanced 
in years and the marriage is appointed 
to take place at a remote and un- 
reasonably long period of time, the 
contract would be voidable, at the 
option of either of the parties, as being 
in restrain of matrimony. If no time 
is fixed and agreed upon for the per- 
formance of the contract, it is in con- 
templation cl law a contract to mar^y 
within a reasonable period after request*. 
Either of the parties, therefore, after 
the making of such a contract, may 
call upon the other to fulfil the engage- 
ment ; and in case of refusal, V>r a 
neglect so to do on the part of the

latter within a reasonable time after the 
request made, the party so calling 
upon the other for a fulfilment of the 
engagement, may treat the betrothment 
as at an end, and bring an action for 
damages for a breach of the engagement 
If both parties lie by for an unreason- 
able period, and neither renew the con- 
tract from time to time by their conduct 
or actions, or call upon one another to 
carry it into execution, the engagement 
will be deemed to be abandoned by 
mutual consent, and the parties will be 
free to marry whom they please." 

2051. "The Roman law very proper- 
ly considered the term of two years 
amply sufficient for the duration of a 
betrothment; and if a man who had 
engaged to marry a girl did not think 
fit to celebrate the nuptial within two 
years from the date of the engage- 
ment, the girl was released from the 
contract." 

2052. DYE SILK LILAC. For 
every pound of silk, take one and a-half 
pound of archil, mix it well with the 
liquor ; make it boil a quarter of an 
hour, dip the silk quickly, then let it 
cool, and wash it in river water, and a 
fine half violet, or lilac, more or less 
full, will be obtained. (See 402.) 

2053. DYE HAIR AND FEA- 
THERS GREEN. Take of verdigris 
or verditer, of each one ounce ; gum 
water, one pint; mix them well, and 
dip the hair or feathers into the mix- 
ture, shaking them well about. (See 
418 to 421.) 

2054. EXCELLENT HAIR 
WASH. Take one ounce of borax, 
half an ounce of camphor ; powder 
these ingredients fine, and dissolve 
them in one quart of boiling water j 
when cool, the solution will be ready 
for use: damp the hair frequently. 
This wash effectually cleanses, beauti- 
fies, and strengthens the hur, preserves 
the colour, and prevents early baldness. 
The camphor will form into lumps 
fitter being dissolved, but the water 
Vvill be sufficiently impregnated. 

2055. ESSENCE OF CELERY. 
This is prepared by soaking for a fort- 



night a-half ounce of the seeds of 
celery in a-quarter pint of brandy. A 
few drops will flavour a pint of soup 01 
broth, equal to a head of celery. 

2056. HICCOUGH, OR HICCUP 
This is a spasm of the diaphragm 
caused by flatulency, indigestion, or 
acidity. It may be relieved by the 
sudden application of cold, also by two 
or three mouthfuls of cold water, by 
eating a small piece of ice, taking *a 
pinch of snuff, or anything that excites 
counter action. 

2057. SUBSTITUTE FOR CREAM 
IN TEA OR COFFEE. Beat the 
white of an egg to a froth, put to it a 
very small lump of butter, and mix 
well. Then turn into it gradually, so 
that it may not curdle. If perfectly 
done, it will be an excellent substitute 
for cream. 

2058. STAINS AND MARKS 
FROM BOOKS. A solution of oxalic 
acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, is at- 
tended with the least risk, and may be 
applied upon the paper and prints with- 
out fear of damage. These acids, tak- 
ing out writing ink, and not touching 
the printing, can be used for restoring 
books where the margins have been 
written upon, without attacking the 
text. (See 543 ) 

2059. MINT VINEGAR. Put into 
a wide-mouthed bottle, fresh nice clean 
mint leaves enough to fill it loosely ; 
then fill tip the bottle with good vine 
gar ; and after it has been stopped close 
for two or three weeks, it is to be 
poured off clear into another bottle, 
and kept well corked for use. Serve 
with lamb when mint cannot be ob- 
iained. 

2060. YELLOW RICE. Take 
one pound of rice, wash it clean and 
aut it into a saucepan which will hold 
;hree quarts ; add to it half a pound of 
currants picked and washed, one quar- 
ter of an ounce of the best turmeric 
powder, previously dissolved in a cup- 
ul of the water, and a stick of cinna- 
mon ; pour over them two quarts ol 
cold water, place the saucepan uncov 
ered on a moderate fire, and allow it tc 



THE HOPE IS SURE WHICH HAS ITS FOUNDATION IN VJKTUE. 



239 



boil till the rice is dry, then stir in a 
quarter of a pound of sugar, and two 
ounces of butter : cover up, and place 
the pan near the fire for a few minutes, 
then mix it well and dish up. This is 
a favourite dish with the Javanese, and 
will be found excellent as a vegetable 
with roast meat, poultry, &c. It also 
forms a capital pudding, which may be 
improved by the addition of raisins, 
and a few blanched almonds. 

2061. NEAT MODE OF SOLDER- 
ING. Cut out a piece of tinfoil the size 
of the surfaces to be soldered. Then 
dip a feather in a solution of sal ammo- 
niac, and wet over the surfaces of the 
metal, then place them in their proper 
position with the tinfoil between. Put 
it so arranged on a piece of iron hot 
enough to melt the foil. When cold 
they will be found firmly soldered 
tog-ether. 

2062. TRACING PAPER. Mix 
together by a gentle heat, one oz. of 
Canada balsam, and a-quarter pint of 
spirits of turpentine ; with a soft brush 
.spread it thinly over one side of good 
tissue paper. It dries quickly, is very 
transparent, and is not greasy, there- 
fore does not stain the object upon 
which it may be placed. 

2063. DYE SILK, &c., CRIMSON. 
Take about a spoonful of cutbear, 
put it into a small pan, pour boiling 
water upon it ; stir and kt it stand a 
tew minutes, then put in the silk, 
and turn it over in a short time, and 
when the colour is full enough, take it 
out ; but if it should require more 
violet or crimson, add a spoonful or 
two of purple archil to some warm 
water ; steep, and dry it within doors. 
It must be mangled, and ought to be 
pressed. 

2064. CLEAN KID GLOVES. 
Make a strong lather with curd soap 
and warm water, in which steep a small 
piece of new flannel. Place the glove 
on a flat, clean, and unyielding surface 
such as the bottom of a dish, and 
having thoroughly soaped the flannel 
(wheu squeezed from the lather), rub 
the kii till al! dirt be removed, clean- 



ing and re-soaping the flannel from 
time to time. Care must be taken to 
omit no part of the glove, by turning 
the fingers, &c. The gloves must be 
dried in the sun, or before a moderate 
fire, and will present the appearance ol 
old parchment. When quite dry, they 
must be gradually "pulled out," and 
will look new. (See 323, 1321.) 

2063. PREVENT GALLING IN 
INVALIDS. The white of an rgu, 
beaten to a strong froth, then drop in 
gradually whilst you are beating two 
teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine, put it 
into a bottle, and apply occasionally 
with a feather. 

2066. MASHED POTATOES AND 
SPINACH OR CABBAGE. Moisten 
cold mashed potatoes with a little 
white sauce : take cold cabbage or 
spinach, and chop either one very finely. 
Moisten them with a brown gravy. Fill 
a tin mould with layers of potatoes and 
cabbage ; cover the top ana put it into 
a stew-pan of boiling water. Let it re- 
main long enough to warm the vege- 
tables ; then turn the vegetables out 
and serve them. This might be pre- 
pared by boiling the vegetables sepa- 
rately, and merely putting them into 
the mould in layers, to be turned out 
when wanted. It forms a very pretty 
dish for an entree. (See 122.) 

2067. COLD CARROTS AND TUR- 
NIPS may be added to soups, if they 
have not been mixed -with gravies ; or 
warmed up separately, and put into 
moulds in layers ; they may be turned 
out, and served the same as the pota- 
toes and cabbage described above. 

2068. RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 
Put a pound of very fine ripe raspberries 
in a bowl, bruise them well, and pour 
upon them a quart of the best white 
wine vinegar ; next day strain the liquor 
on a pound of fresh ripe raspberries ; 
braise them also, and the following day 
do the same, but do not squeeze the fruit, 
or it will make it foment; only drain 
'he liquor as dry as you can from it. 
The last time pass it through a canvas 
bag, previously wet with the vinegar, to 
prevent waste. Put the juice into 



240 



VICE CHEATS ITS VOTARIES. 



stone jar, with a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice ; the sugar must be 
broken into lumps ; stir it, arid when 
melted, put the jar into a pan of water; 
let it simmer, and skim it ; when cold, 
bottle it ; it will be fine, and thick, 
when cold, like strained honey, newly 
prepared. 
2069. SIGNS OF THE WEATHER. 

2070. DEW. If the dew lies plenti- 
fully on the grass after a fair day, it is a 
sign of another. If not, and there is no 
wind, rain must follow. A red even- 
ing portends fine weather ; but if it 
spread too far upwards from the hori- 
zon in the evening, and especially 
morning, it foretells wind or rain, or 
both. When the sky, in rainy weather, 
is tinged with sea green, the rain 
will increase ; if with deep blue, it will 
be showery. (See 3366.) 

2071. CLOUDS. Against much rain, 
the clouds grow bigger, and increase 
very fast, especially before thunder. 
When the clouds are formed like fleeces, 
but dense in the middle and bright to- 
wards the edges, with the sky bright, 
they are signs of a frost, with hail, snow, 
or rain. If clouds form high in air, in 
thin white trains like locks of wool, 
they portend wind, and probably rain. 
When a general cloudiness covers the 
eky, and small black fragments of clouds 
fly underneath, they are a sure sign of 
rain, and probably it will be lasting. 
Two currents of clouds always portend 
rain, and, in summer, thunder. 

2072. HEAVENLY BODIES. A haziness 
in the air, which fades the sun's light, 
and ma^es the orb appear whitish, or 
ill-defined or at night, if the moon and 
stars grow dim, and a. ring encircles 
the former, rain will follow. If the 
sun's rays appear like Moses' horns if 
white at setting, or shorn of his rays, or 
goes down into a bank of clouds in the 
horizon, bad weather is to be expected. 
If the moon looks pale and dim, we ex- 
pect rain; if red, wind; and if or her 
natural colour, with a clear sky, fair 
weather. If the moon is rainy through- 
out, it will be clear at the change, and 
perhaps the rain return a few days 



after. If fair throughout, and rain at 
the change, the fair weathtr will pro- 
bably return on the fourth or fifth day. 

2073. ASTHMA. The following ii 
recommended as a relief. Two ounces 
of the best honey, and one ounce (A 
castor oil mixed. A teaspoonful to J-e 
taken night and morning. 

2074. MILDEW OUT OF LINEN. 
Take soap, and rub it well ; then 
scrape some fine chalk, and rub it also 
on the linen. Lay it on the grass. As 
it dries, wet it a little, and it will come 
out in twice doing. 

2075. EXCELLENT REMEDY FOR 
SPRAINS. Put the white of an egg 
into a saucer, keep stirring it with a 
piece of alum about the size of a walnut 
until it becomes a thick jelly ; apply a 
prrtion of it on a piece of lint or tow 
large enough to cover the sprain, 
ch'inging it for a fresh one as often as 
it feels warm or dry ; the limb is to be 
kept in an horizontal position by 
plucing it on a chair. 

2076. REMEDY FOR RHEUMA- 
TISM, LUMBAGO, SPRAINS, BRUI- 
SES, CHILBLAINS, (BEFORE THEY 
ARE BROKEN) AND BITES OF 
INSECTS. One raw egg well beaten, 
half a pint of vinegar, one ounce of 
spirits of turpentine, a quarter of an 
an ounce of spirits of wine, a quarter 
of an ounce of camphor. These ingif di- 
ents to be Beaten well together, ,hen 
put in a bottle and shaken for ten 
minutes, after which, to be corked 
down tightly to exclude the air. In 
half an hour it is fit for use. J*rrec 
tions: To be well rubbed in, two, 
three, or four times a day. For tfieu- 
matism in the head, to be rubb* 1 at 
th'jback of the neck and behind the *ars. 

2077. UNFERMENTED BRFAD. 
Three pounds wheat meal ; half an 
ounce, avoirdupois, muriatic acid ; hall 
an ounce, avoirdupois, carbonate soda ; 
wnter enough to make it of a proper 
consistence. For white flour, lour 
pounds of flour ; half an ounce, avoir- 
dupois, muriatic acid ; half an ounce, 
avoirdupois, carbonate eoda ; water 
about a quaM. The v.ay of milking i 



TIME, WHICH IS MOST VALUABLE, IS MOST TRIFLED WITH. 



ai follows : First mix the soda and 
flour well together by rubbing in a pan ; 
then pour the acid into the water, and 
mix well by stirring. Mix altogether to 
the required consistence, and bake in a 
hot oven immediately. The gain from 
this method of baking is as follows : 
four pounds of wheat meal made seven 
pounds nine ounces of excellent light 
bread ; and four pounds of seconds 
flour made six pounds of excellent light 
bread. It keeps moist longer than 
bread made with yeast, and is far more 
sweet and digestible. This is especially 
recommended to persons who suffer 
from indigestion, who will find the brown 
bread invaluable. (See 461.) 

2078. SCURF IN THE HEAD. A 
simple and effectual remedy. Into a 
pint of water drop a lump of fresh 
quick lime, the size of a walnut; let it 
stand all night, then pour the water off 
clear from the sediment or deposit, add 
a quarter of a pint of the best vinegar, 
and wash the head with the mixture. 
Perfectly harmless ; only wet the roots 
of the hair. (See 1276.) 

2079. JAUNDICE. One penny- 
worth of allspice, ditto of flour of 
brimstone, ditto of turmeric ; these 
to be well pounded together, and 
afterwards to be mixed with half- 
a-potind of molasses. Two table-spoon- 
fuls to betaken every day. (See 1247.) 

2080. CRAMP IN THE LEGS. 
Stretch out the he-el of the leg as far as 
possible, at the same time drawing up 
the toes as far as possible. This will 
often stop a fit of the cramp after it 
hag commenced. 

2081. CLEAN FURS. Strip the 
fur articles of their stuffing and binding, 
and lay them as much as possible in a 
flat position. They must then be sub- 
jected to a very brisk brushing, with a 
stiff clothes brush ; after this, any 
moth-eaten parts must be cut out, and 
be neatly replaced by new bits of fur 
to match. Sable, chinchilla, squirrel, 
fitch, &c., should be treated as follows: 
Warm a quantity of new bran in a 
pan, taking care that it does not burn, 
to prevent which it must be actively- 



stirred. When well warmed, rub it 
thoroughly into the fur with the hand 
Repeat this two or three times ; then 
shake the fur, and give it another sharp 
brushing until free from dust. White 
furs, ermine, &c., may -be cleaned as 
follows : Lay the fur on the table, and 
rub it well with bran made moist with 
warm water ; rub until quite dry, and 
afterwards with dry bran. The wet 
bran should be put on with flannel, and 
the dry with a piece of book-muslin. 
The light furs in addition to tho 
above should be well rubbed with 
magnesia, or a piece of book-muslin, 
after the bran process. Furs are usually 
much improved by stretching, which 
may be managed as follows : to a pint 
of soft water add three ounces of salt, 
dissolve ; with this solution sponge the 
inside of the skin ('taking care not to 
wet the fur), until it bec.oines thorough- 
ly saturated ; then lay it carefully on a 
board with the fur side downwards, in 
its natural disposition ; then stretch, as 
much as it will bear to the required 
shape, and fasten with small tacks. 
The drying may be quickened by placing 
the skin a little distance from the fire 
or stove. 

2082. WHIST. (Upon the princi- 
ples of Hoyle's games). Great silence 
and attention must be observed by the 
players. Four persons cut for partners ; 
the two highest are against the two 
lowest. The partners sit opposite to 
each other, and the person who cuts 
the lowest card is entitled to the deal. 
The ace is the lowest in cutting. 

Each person has a right to shuffle the 
cards before the deal ; but it is usual for 
the elder hand only, and the dealer after. 

The pack is then cut by the right 
hand adversary; and the dealer dis- 
tributes the cards, one by one, to each 
of the players; beginning with the 
person who sits on his left hand until 
he comes to the last card, which 
he turns up, being the trump, and leaves 
on the table till the first trick is played. 

The person on the left hand side of 
the dealer is called the elder, and play 
first; whoever wins the trick becorai 



242 



THE OATHS OF THE PASSIONATE HAVE NO MEANING. 



elder hand, and plays again ; and so on, 
till the cards are played out. 

No intimations or signs of any kind, 
during the play of the cards, are per- 
mitted between the partners. The 
mistake of one" party is the game of 
the adversary, except in revoke, when 
the partners may inquire if he has any 
of the suit in his hand. 

The tricks belonging to each party 
should be turned and collected by the 
respective partners of whoever wins 
.he first trick in every hand. 

All above six tricks reckon towards 
the game. 

The ace, king, queen, and knave of 
trumps are called honours ; and when 
either of the partners have three sepa- 
rately, or between them, they coui.t 
two points towards the game; and ij 
case they have four honours, they 
count four points. 

The game, consists of ten points. 

2083. TERMS USED IN WHIST. 
Finessing, is the attempt to gain an 
advantage ; thus : If you have the 
best, and third best card of the suit led, 
you put on the third best, and run the 
risk of your adversary having the 
/second best ; if he has it not, which is 
two to one against him, you are then 
certain of gaining a trick. 

Forcing, is playing the suit of which 
your partner or adversary has not any, 
and which he must trump, in order to win. 

Long trump, means the having one or 
more trumps in your hand when all the 
rest are out. 

Loose card, means a card in hand of 
110 value/ and the most proper to throw 
away. 

Points. Ten make the game; as 
many as are gained by tricks or honours, 
BO many points are set up to the score 
of the game. 

Quart, is four successive cards in any 
euit. 

Quart Major, is a sequence of r.ce, 
king, queen, and knave. 

Quint, is five successive cards in any 
eiiit. 

Quint Major, is a sequence of ace, 
V'mg, queen, and ten. 



See saw, is when each partner turns 
a suit, and when they play those suits to 
each other for that purpose. 

Score, is the number of points set up. 
Tto following is the most approved 
method of ecoring : 
1 23 456789 
00 000 
00 000 0000 00 000 00 



Slam, is when cither party win every 
trick. 

Tenace, is possessing the first and 
third best cards, and being the last 
player, you consequently catch the 
adversary when that suit is played; as, 
for instance, in case you have ace and 
quetsn of any suit, and your adversary 
leads thai mit, you must win two 
tricks, by having the best and third 
best of the suit played, and being the 
last player. 

Terce, is three successive cards in 
any suit. 

Terce Major, is a sequence of ace, 
king, and queen. 

2084. KULES. 1. Lead from your 
strong suit, and be cautious how you 
change suits ; and keep a commanding 
card to bring it in again. 

2. Lead through the strong suit and 
up to the weak, but not in trumps, 
unless very strong in them. 

3. Lead the highest of a sequence ; 
but if you have a quart or cinque to a 
king, lead the lowest. 

4. Lead through an honour, partic- 
ularly if the game is much against you. 

5. Lead your best trump, if the ad- 
versaries be eight, and you have no 
honour; but not if you have four 
trumps, unless you have a sequence. 

6. Lead a trump if you have four or 
five, or a strong hand ; but not if weak. 

7. Having ace, king, and two or 
three small cards, lead ace and king, 
if weak in trumps, but a small one if 
strong in them. 

8. If you have the last trutnp, witu 
some winning cards, and one losing 
card only, lead the losing card. 

9. Return your partner's lead, not 
the adversaries ; and if you Lave only

three originally, play the best; but you 
need not return it immediately, when 
you win with a king, queen, or knave, 
and have only small ones, or when you 
hold a good sequence, have a strong 
suit, or have five trumps. 

10. Do not lead from ace queen, or 
tice knave. 

11. Do not lead an ace, unless you 
have a king. 

12. Do not lead a thirteenth card, 
unless trumps be out. 

J 3. Do not trump a thirteenth card, 
unless you be last player or want the 
lead. 

14. Keep a small card to return your 
partner's lead. 

15. Be cautious in trumping a card 
when strong in trumps, particularly if 
you have a strong suit. 

16. Having only a few small trumps, 
make them when you can. 

17. If your partner refuses to trump 
A suit, of which he knows you have not 
the best, lead your best trump. 

18. When you hold all the remaining 
trumps play one, and then try to put 
the lead in your partner's hand. 

19. Remember how many of each 
euit are out, and what is the best card 
left in each hand. 

20. Never force your partner if 
are weak in trumps, unless you have a 
renounce, or want the odd trick. 

21. When playing for the odd trick, 
be cautious of trumping out, especially 
if your partner be likely to trump a 
suit ; and make all the tricks you can 
early, and avoid finessing. 

22. If you take a trick and have a 
sequence, win it with the lowest. 

2085. LAWS OF WHIST. 
2086. Dealing I. If a card be 
turned up in dealing, the adverse party 
may call a new deal, unless they have 
been the cause ; then the dealer has the 
option. 

2. If a card be faced in the deal, the 
dealer must deal again, unless it be the 
last deal. 

3. If any one play with twelve cards, 
and tfap rest have thirteen, the deal to 



stand good, and the player to be 
punished for each revoke ; but, if any 
have fourteen cards, the deal is lost. 

4. The dealer to leave the trump 
card on the table till his turn to play ; 
after which none may ask what card 
was turned up, only what is trumps. 

5. No person may take up the cards 
while dealing; if the dealer in that case 
should iniss the deal, to deal again, un- 
less his partner's fault; and if a card 
be turned up iu dealing, no new deal, 
unless the partner' s fault. 

6. If the dealer put the trump card 
on the rest, with face downwards, he is 
to lose the deal. 

2087. Playingoutofturn.7.If&ny 
person play out of his turn, the adver- 
sary may call the card played at any 
time, if he do not make him revoke ; or 
if either of the adverse party be to lead, 
may desire his partner to name the suit, 
which must be played. 

8. If a person supposes he has won 
the trick, and leads again before his 
partner has played, the adversary may 
oblige his partner to win it, if he can. 

9. If a person lead, and his partner 
play before his turn, the adversary's 
partner may do the same. 

10. If the ace, or any other card of 
you^ a suit, be led, and any person play out 

of turn, whether his partner have any 
of the suit led or not, he is neither to 
trump it nor win it, provided he do not 
revoke. 

2088. Revoking. 11. If a revoke 
happen to be made, the adversary may 
add three to their score, or take three 
tricks from them, or take down three 
from their score ; and, if up, must re- 
main at nine. 

12. If any person revoke, and, before 
the cards be turned, discover it, the 
adversary may cause the highest or 
lowest of the suit led, or call the card 
then played at any time, if it do not 
cause a revoke. 

13. No revoke to be claimed till the 
trik be turned and quitted, or the 
party who revoked, or his partner, have 
played again. 

14. If aoy person claim a revoke. 



244 



A GOOD l;of:K IS A UGlIT TO THE SOUL. 



the .adverse party are not to mix their 
cards, upon forfeiting the revoke. 

15. No revoke can be claimed after 
the cards are cut for a new deal. 

2089. Calling honours. 16. If any 
person call, except at the point of eight, 
the adverse party may consult, and have 
a nevr deal. 

17. After the trump card is turned 
up, no person may remind his partner 
to call, on penalty of losing one point. 

18. If the trump card be turned up, 
no honours can be set up, unless before 
claimed ; and scoring honours, not hav- 
ing them, to be scored against them. 

19. If any person call at eight, and 
be answered, and the opposite parties 
have thrown down their cards, and it 
appear they have not their honours, they 
may consult, and have a new deal or 
not. 

20. If any person answer without an 
honour, the adversaries may consult 
and stand the deal or not. 

21. If any person call at eight, after 
he has played, the adversaries may call 
a new deal. 

2090. Separating find Showing the 
Cards. 22. If any person separate a 
card from the rest, the adverse party 
may call it if he name it ; but if he call 
a wrong card, he or his partner are 
liable, for once, to have the highest or 
lowest card called in any suit led dur- 
ing that deal, 

23. If any person throw his cards on 
the table, supposing the game lost, he 
may not take them up, and the adver- 
saries may call them, provided he do 
not revoke. 

24. If any person be sure of winning 
every trick in his hand, he may show 
his cards, but is liable to have them 
called. 

2091. Omitting to play to a Trick. 
25. If any person omit to play to a 
trick, and it appear he has one card 
more than the rest, it shall be at the 
option of the adversary to have a new 
deal. 

2092. Respecting icho played a, Par- 
ticular Card. 26. Each person ought 
to lay his card before him ; and if either 



of the adversaries mix their came with 
his, his partner may demand each per- 
eon to lay his card before him, but not 
to inquire who played any particular 
card. 

These laws are agreed to by the best 
judges. 

2093. MAXIMS FOK WHIST. 
2094. Leader I. Begin with the 
suit of which you have most in num 
ber ; for, when the trumps are out, you 
will, probably make several tricks by 
it. 

2. If you hold equal numbers in dif- 
ferent suits, begin with the strongest, 
because it is the least liable to injure 
your partner. 

3. Sequences are always eligible 
leads, as supporting your partner with- 
out injuring your own hand. 

4. Lead from a king or queen, rather 
than from an ace ; for, since the adver- 
saries will lead from those suits which 
you do not, your ace will do them most 
harm. 

5. Lead from a king rather than a 
queen, and from a queen rather than 
from a knave ; for the stronger the suit, 
the less is your partner endangered. 

6. Lead not from ace queen, or ace 
knave, till necessary; for, if that suit be 
led by the adversaries, you have a good 
chance of making two tricks in it. 

7. In all sequences to a queen, knave, 
or ten, begin with the highest, because 
it will frequently distress your left- 
hand adversary. 

8. Having ace, king, and knave, lead 
the king : for, if strong in trumps, you 
may wait the return of this suit, and 
finesse the knave. 

9. Having ace, queen, and one small 
card, lead the small one ; for, by this 
lead, your partner has a chance to make 
the knave. 

10. Having ace, king, and two or 
three small cards, play ace and king, if 
weak, but a small card, if strong in 
trumps, you may give your partner the 
chance of making the first trick. 

11. Having king, queen, and one 
small card, play the small one ; for youi 
partner has an equal chance to win 



OBSERVATION IS THE BEST TEACHER. 



245 



and you need not fe.ar to make king or 
queen. 

12. Having king, queen, and two 
or tnree small cards, lead a small card 
if strong, and the king if weak in 
trumps ; for .strength in trumps entitles 
you to play a backward game, and give 
your partner a chance of winning the 
first trick ; but, if weak in trumps, lead 
the king or queen, to secure a trick in 
that suit. 

13. Having an ace, with four small 
cards, anfl no other good suit-, play a 
small card, if strong in trumps, and the 
ace it weak; for strength in trumps 
may enable you to make one or two of 
the small cards, although your partner 
cannot support the lead. 

14. Having king, knave, and ten, 
lead the ten ; for, if your partner hold 
the ace, you have a good chance to 
make three tricks, whether he pass the 
ten or not. 

15. Having king, queen, and ten, 
lead the king; for, if it fail, by putting 
on the ten, upon the return of that 
suit from your partner, you have a 
chance of making two tricks. 

16. Having queen, knave, and nine, 
lead the queen ; for, upon the return of 
that suit from your partner by putting 
on the nine, you will, probably, make 
the knave. 

2095. Second Hand. 1. Having ace, 
king, and small ones, play a small card, 
if strong in trumps j but the king if 
weak in them ; for, otherwise, your ace 
or king mfght be trumped, in the latter 
case, and no hazards should be run with 
few trumps but in critical cases. 

2. Having ace, queen, and small cards, 
play a small one, for, upon the return 
of that suit, you will, probably, make 
two tricks. 

3. Having ace, knave, and small 
?ards. play a small one, for, upon the 
return of that suit, you will, perhaps, 
make two tricks. 

4. Having ace, ten, or nine, with 
small cards, play a small one, for, by 
this method, you have a chance of 
making two tricks in the suit. 

5. Having king, queen, teu and 



small cards, play the queen; for, by 
playing the ten upon the return of the 
suit, you will probably, make twe 
tricks in it. 

6. Having king, queen, and small 
cards, play a small card if strong in 
trumps, but the queen if weak in them; 
for strength in trumps warrants playing 
a backward game, and it is always ad- 
vantageous to keep back your adver- 
sary's suit. 

7. If you hold a sequence to your 
highest card in the suit, play the low- 
est of it, for, by this means, your part- 
ner will be informed of your strength. 

8. Having- queen, knave, and small 
ones, play the knave, because you will, 
probably, secure a trick. 

9. Having queen, ten, and small ones, 
play a small one, for you partner has an 
equal chance to win. 

10. Having either ace, king, queen, 
or knave, with small cards, play a email 
one, for your partner has an equal 
chance to win the trick. 

11. Having either ace, king, queen, 
or knave, with one small card only, 
play the small one, for, otherwise, your 
adversary will finesse upon you. 

12. If a queen be led, and you hold 
the king, put that on, for if your part- 
ner hold the ace, you do no harm ; and, 

f the king be taken the adversaries 
have played two honours to one. 

14. If a king be led, and you hold 
ace, knave, and small ones, play the 
ace, for it cannot do the adversay a 
reater injury. 

2096. Third Hand. 1. Having aca 
and king, play the ace and return the 
king, because you should not keep the 
command of your partner's strong 
suit. 

2. Having ace and queen, play the 
ace, and return the queen ; for, although 

t may prove better in some cases to 
put on the queen, yet, in general, your 
sartner is best supported by this 
method. 

3. Having ace and knave, play the 
ace and return the knave, in order to 
strengthes your partner's hand. 

4. Having king aid knave, play th 



246 



FALSEHOOD, LlKli A NETTLE, STIiNGS THOSE WHO MEDDLE WITH IT. 



king; and, if it win, return the knave, 
for the reason in No. 3. 

5. Always play the best when your 
partner plays a small card, as it best 
supports your partner. 

6. If you hold the ace and one small 
card only, and your partner lead the 
king, put on the ace, and return the 
small one ; for, otherwise, your ace will 
be an obstruction to his suit. 

7. If you hold the king and one 
email card onty, and your partner lead 
the ace, if the trumps be out, play the 
king: for, by putting on the king 
there will be no obstruction to the 
suit. 

2097. Fourth Hand.l. If a king 
be led, and you hold ace, knave, and a 
small card, play the small one; for, 
supposing the queen to follow, you pro- 
bably make both ace and knave. 

2. When the third hand is weak in 
his partner's lead, you may often re- 
turn that suit to great advantage ; 
but this rule must not be applied to 
trumps, unless you are very strong 
indeed. 

2098. Cases in which you should re- 
turn your partner's lead ijnmcdiatcly. 
1. When you win with the ace and can 
return an honour, for that will greatly 
strengthen his hand. 

2. When he leads a trump, in which 
case, return the best remaining in your 
hand, (unless you held four originally), 
except the lead be through an honour. 

3. When your partner has trumped 
out ; for then it is evident he wants to 
make his great suit. 

4. When, you have no good card in 
any other suit ; for then you entirely 
depend on your own partner. 

2099. Cases in which you should not 
eturn your partner's lead immediately. 
1. If you win with the king, queen, 
pr knave, and have only small cards 
left ; for the return of a small card will 
more distress than strengthen your 
partner. 

2. If you hold a good sequence ; for 
then you may show a strong suit, and 
not injure his hand. 

3. If you have a strong suit ; because 



leading from a strong suit direuls youi 
partner, and cannot injure him. 

4. If you have a good hand ; for in 
this case you ought to consult you* 
own hand. 

5. If you hold five trumps ; for then 
you are warranted to play trumps, if 
you think it right. 

2100. Leading Trumps. 1. Lead 
trumps from a strong hand, but never 
from a weak one, by which means you 
will secure your good cards from being 
trumped. 

2. Trump not out with a bad hand, 
although you hold five small trumps; 
for, since your cards are bad, it is only 
trumping for the adversaries' good ones. 

3. Having ace, king, knave, and 
three small trumps, play ace and king; 
for the probability of the queen's fall- 
ing is in your favour. 

4. Having ace, king, knave, and one 
or two small trumps, play the king, and 
wait the return froni your partner to 
put on the knave, in order to win the 
queen; but if you particularly wish the 
trumps out, play two rounds, and then 
your strong suit. 

5. Having ace, king, and two or threo 
small trumps, lead a small one ; this is 
to let your partner win the first trick ; 
but, if you have good reason for getting 
out the trumps, play three rounds, or 
play ace and king, and then proceed 
with your strong suit. 

6. If your adversaries be eight, and 
you do do not hold an honour, throw oft* 
your best trump, for, if your partner 
has not two honours, you have lost 
the game ; and, if he holds two ho- 
nours, it is most advantageous to lead 
a trump. 

7. Having ace, queen, knave, and 
small trumps, play the knave ; for, by 
this means, the king only can make 
against you. 

8. Having ace, queen, ten, and one 
or two small trumps, lead a small one, 
for it will give your partner a chance 
to win the trick, and keep the com- 
mand in your own hand. 

9. Having king, queen, ten, and 
small trumps, lead the king ; for if the 



STRIVE TO LEARN FROM ALL THINGS. 



247 



king be lost, upon the return of trumps, 
you may finesse the ten. 

10. Having king, knave, ten, and 
small ones, lead the knave, because it 
will prevent the adversaries from 
making a small trump. 

1 1 . Having queen, knave, nine, and 
small trumps, lead the queen ; for, if 
your partner hold the ace, jou have a 
good chance of making the* whole suit. 

12. Having queen, knave, and two 
or three small trumps, lead the queen, 
for the reason in No. 11. 

13. Having knave, tvn, eight, and 
small trumps, lead the luiave ; for, on 
the return of trumps, you probably, 
may finesse the eight to advantage. 

14. Having knave, ten, eight, and 
three small trumps, lead the knave, be- 
cause it will most distress your adversa- 
ries, unless two honours are held on 
your right hand ; the odds against which 
are about three to one. 

15. Having only small trumps, play 
the highest : by which you will support 
your partner all you can. 

16. Having a sequence, begin with 
the highest; by this means, your 
partner is best instructed how to play 
his hand, and cannot possibly be 
injured. 

17. If any honour be turned up on 
your left, and the game much against 
you, lead a trump the first opportunity ; 
for, your game being desperately bad, 
this method is the most likely to re- 
trieve it. 

18. In all other cases it is dangerous 
leading through an honour, unless you 
be strong in trumps, or have a good 
hand ; because all the advantage of 
trumping through an honour lies in your 
partner's finessing. 

19. Supposing it hereafter proper to 
lead trumps, when an honour is turned 
up on your left, you, holding only one 
honour with a small trump, play the 
honour and next the small one ; because 
It will greatly strengthen your part- 
ner's hand, and cannot hurt your own. 

20. If an honour be turned up on 
the left, and you hold a sequence, lead 
the high ?!. >f it. I erause 't v'll pre- 



vent the last hand from injuring you* 
partner. 

21. If a queen be turned up on the 
left, and you hold ace, king, and a 
small one, lead the small trump, because 
you will have a chance of getting the 
queen. 

22. If a queen be turned up on the 
left, and you hold a knave, with small 
ones, lead the knave ; for the knave 
cannot be of service, as the queen is on 
your left. 

23. If an honour be turned up by 
your partner, and you strong in trumps, 
lead a small one ; but if weak in them, 
lead the best you have ; by this play 
the weakest hand will support the 
strongest. 

24. If an ace be turned up on the 
right, you holding king, queen, and 
knave, lead the knave ; a secure lead. 

25. If an ace be turned up on the 
right, and you hold king, queen, and 
ten, lead the king, and upon the return 
of trumps play the ten ; for, by this 
means, you show a great strength 
to your partner, and will, probably 
make two tricks in them. 

26. If a king be turned up on the 
right, and you hold queen, knave, and 
nine, lead knave, and, upon the return 
of trumps, play the nine, because it 
may prevent the ten from making. 

27. If a king be turned up on your 
right, and you hold knave, ten and 
nine, lead the nine, and, upon the 
return of trumps play the ten ; because 
this method will best disclose your 
strength in trumps. 

2.8. If a queen be turned up on the 
right, and you hold ace, king, and 
knave, lead the king, and, upon the 
return of trumps, play the knave, 
because you are then certain to make 
the knave. 

29. If a queen be turned up on the 
right, and you hold ace, king, and small 
ones, lead the king; and upon the 
return of trumps, you may finesse, 
unless the queen falls, for otherwise 
the queen will make a trick. 

30. If a knave be turned up on the 
right, and you hold king, queen, and 



248 



AN ILL FIXED BLIND NO ONE CAN WIND. 



ten, lead the queen, and, upon the 
return of trumps, pUv the ten ; for, by 
this means, you will make the ten. 

31 . If a knave be turned up on the 
right, and you hold king, queen, and 
small ones, lead the king : and if that 
come home, play a small one, for it is 
probable your partner holds the ace. 

32. If a knave be turned up on the 
right, and you hold king and ten or 
queen and ten, with two small cards, 
lead a small one ; and, upon the 
return of trumps play the ten, for it is 
five to four that your partner holds one 
honour. 

2101. IVJien you turn up an Honour. 
1. If you turn up an ace, and hold 
only one small trump with it, if either 
adversary lead the king, put on the ace. 

2. But, if you turn up an ace, and 
hold two or three small trumps with it, 
and either adversary lead the king, put 
on a small one ; for, if you play the ace, 
you give up the command in trumps. 

3. If you turnup the king, and hold 
only one small trump with it, and your 
right hand adversary lead a trump, 
play the king". 

4. If you turn up a king, and hold 
two or three small trumps with it, if 
your right hand adversary lead a trump, 
play a small one. 

5. If you turn up a queen or knave, 
and hold, besides, only small trumps, 
if your right hand adversary lead a 
trump, put on a small one. 

6. If you hold a sequence to the 
honour turned up, play it last. 

2102. Playing for the Odd Trick. I. 
Be cautious of trumping out, notwith- 
standing you have a good hand. 

2. Never trump out, if your partner 
appears likely to trump a suit. 

3. If you are moderately strong in 
trumps, force your partner, for by this 
you probably make a trick. 

4. Make your tricks early, and be 
cautious of finessing. 

5. If you hold a single card of any 
suit, and only two or three small 
trumps, lead the single card. 

2103. CALCULATIONS. 
1 . I* is about five to four that you; 



partner holds one card out of any 
two. 

2. It is about five to two that he 
holds one card out of three. 

3. It is about four to ope that b 
holds one card out of any four. 

I. It is two to one that he does not 
hold a certain card. 

5. It is about three to one that he 
does not hold two cards out of any 
three. 

6. It is about three to two that he 
does not hold two cards out of any 
four. 

2104. CRIBBAGE. The game of 
Cribbage differs from all other games 
by its immense variety of chances. It 
*s reckoned useful to young people in 
the science of calculation. It is played 
with the whole pack of cards, generally 
by two persons, and sometimes by four. 
There are also five different modes of , 
playing that is, with five, six, or eight 
cards; but the games are principally 
those with five and six cards. The 
rules vary a little in different companies, 
but the following are those most gener- 
ally observed : 

2105. TERMS USED IN CRIBBAGE. 
Crib. The cards thrown away by 
each party, and the dealer is entitled to 
score whatever poiuts are made by 
them. 

Pairs are two similar cards ; as two 
aces or two kings. Whether in hand 
or playing they reckon for two points. 

Pairs Royal are three similar cards, 
and reckon for six points, whether in 
hand or playing. 

Double Pairs Royal are four similar 
cards, and reckon for twelve points, 
whether in hand or playing. The 
points gained by pairs, pairs royal, and 
double pairs royal, in playing, are thus 
affected : Your adversary having 
played a seven and you another, con- 
stitutes a pair, and entitles you to score 
two points ; your antagonist then play, 
ing a third seven, makes a pair royal 
and he marks six ; and your playing- a 
fourth is a double pair royal, and en- 
titles you to twelve points. 

Fifteens. Every fifteen reckons foi 



FIRE IS A GOOD SERVANT BUT A BAD MASTER. 



249 



fcW3 points, whether in hand or playing. 
In hand they are formed either by two 
sards, such as a five and any tenth 
sard, a six and a nine, a eeven and an 
eight, or by three cards, as a two, a five, 
and an eight, &,c. And in playing thus, 
if such cards are played as make to- 
gether fifteen, the two points are to be 
scored towards the game. 

Sequences are three or four more suc- 
cessive cards, and reckon for an equal 
number of points, either in hand or 
play. In playing a sequence, it is of 
no consequence which card is thrown 
down first ; as thus : your adversary 
playing an ace, you a five, he a three, 
you a two, then he a four, he counts 
five for the sequence. 

Flush. When the cards are all of one 
suit, they reckon for as many points as 
there are cards. For a flush in the 
crib, the card turned up must be of the 
game suit as those put out in the crib. 

Noddy. The knave of the suit turned 
up reckons for one point ; if a knave 
be turned up, the dealer is to mark 
two ; but it cannot be reckoned again ; 
and when played it does not score any- 
thing. 

End Hole. The point scored by the 
last player, if he makes under thirty- 
One ; if he makes thirty-one exactly, 
he is to mark two. To obtain either of 
these is considered a great advantage. 

Last. Three points taken at the con:

2106. RULES OF CRIBBAGE. l.The 
adverse parties cut the cards to deter- 
mine who shall be dealer ; the lowest 
card has it. The ace is the lowest. 

2. In dealing, the dealer may dis- 
cover his own cards, but not those of 
his adversary who may mark two, 
a, d call a fresh deal. 

3. Should too many cards be dealt 
to either, the non-dealer may score two, 
and demand another deal, if the error 
be detected previous to taking up 
the cards , if he do not wish a new 
3e;il, the extra cards must be drawn 
aw a" \vhnn *uy player has ra^e than 



the proper number of cards in hand, 
the opponent may score four and call 
a new deal. 

4. If any player meddle with the 
pack after dealing, till the period of 
cutting it for the turn-up card, then 
his opponent may score two points. 

5. If any player take more than he 
is entitled to, the other party should 
not only put him back as many points 
as are overscored, but likewise take the 
same extra number for his own game. 

6. Should either party even meddle 
with his own pegs unnecessarily, the 
opponent may score two points ; and if 
any one take out his front peg, he must 
place the same back behind the other. 
If any be misplaced by accident, a by- 
stander may replace the same, accord- 
ing to the best of his judgment ; but 
he should never otherwise interfere. 

7. If any player neglect to set up 
what he is entitled to, the adversary 
is allowed to take the points so omitted. 

8. Each player may place his own 
cards, when done with, upon the pack. 

9. In five-card cribbage, the cards 
are to be dealt one by ono ; but when 
played with six cards, then it is cus- 
tomary to give three, and if with eight 
cards, four at a time. 

10. The non-dealer, at the com- 
mencement of the game, in five- 
card cribbage, scores three points, 
called three for last ; but in six and 
eight-card cribbage this is not to be 
done. 

11. In what is called the Bath game, 
they reckon flushes upon the board ; 
that is, when three cards of the same 
suit are played successively, the party 
playing the third scores three points ; 
if the adversary play a fourth of the 
same suit, then he is to score four, and 
so on for four, five, six, or as long as the 
the same suit continues to be played in 
uninterrupted succession, and that the 
whole number of pips do not reckun 
thirty-one.

thereon make the game. We have 
before said, that the party cutting 
the lowest card deals ; after which, 
each player is first to lay out two of 
the five cards for the crib, which 
always belongs to the dealer; next, 
the adversary is to cut the remainder 
of the pack, and the dealer to turn 
up and lay upon the crib the uppermost 
card, for which, if a knave, he is to 
mark two points. The card turned up 
is to be reckoned by both parties, 
whether in showing their hands or crib. 
After laying-out and cutting as above- 
mentioned, the eldest hand is to play a 
card, which the other should endeavour 
to pair, or find one, the pips of which, 
reckoned with the first, will make fif- 
teen ; then the non-dealer must play 
another card, and try to make a pair, 
pair-royal, sequence, flush, (where 
allowed of) or fifteen, provided the cards 
already played have not exceeded that 
number -, and so on alternately, until 
the pips on the cards played make 
thirty-one, or, the nearest possible num- 
ber under that. 

When the party whose turn it may 
be to play, cannot produce a card that 
will make thirty-one, or come under 
that number he is then to say Go to his 
antagonist, who, thereupon, will be en- 
titled to score one, or must play any 
card or cards he may have that will 
make thirty-one, or under ; and if he 
can make exactly thirty-one, he is to 
take two points ; if not, one ; the last 
player has often opportunity this way 
to make pairs or sequences. Such 
cards as remain after this are not to be 
played ; but each party having, during 
the play, scored his points gained, in the 
manner before directed, must proceed ; 
the non-dealer first to count and take 
for his hand, then the dealer for his 
hand, and also for his crib, reckoning 
the cards every way they can possibly 
be varied, and always including the 
t irned-up-card. Points

2108. MAXIMS FOR LAYING OUT THE 
CRIB CARDS. It is always requisite in 
laying out cards for the crib, that every 
player should consider not only his own 
hand, but also to whom the crib be- 
longs, as well as the state of the game ; 
for what might be proper in one situa- 
tion would be highly imprudent in 
another. When any player possesses a 
pair-royal, it is generally advisable to 
lay out the other cards, for crib, unless 
it belongs to the adversary, and they 
consist of two fives, a deuce, and a 
trois, five and six, seven and eight, five 
and any other tenth card, or that the 
game be almost finished. A player, 
when he does not thereby materially 
injure his hand, should for his own 
crib, lay out close cards, in hope of 
making a sequence, or two of a suit, in 
expectation of a flush ; or any that of 
themselves amount to fifteen, or such 
as reckoned with others will make that 
number, except when the -antagonist be 
nearly up, and it may be expedient to 
keep such cards that probably may pre- 
vent him from gaining at play. The 
direct contrary method should be pur- 
sued in respect to the adversary's crib, 
which each person should endeavour 
to baulk, by laying out those cards that 
'c v e not likely to prove to advantage, 
unless at such a stage of the game, 
\\ neii it may be of consequence to keep 
in hand cards likely to tell in play, or 
when the non-dealer would be either 
out by his hand, or has reason for 
judging the crib of little moment. A 
king is the best card to baulk a crib, 
as none can form a sequence beyond it, 
except in some companies, where king, 
queen, ace, are allowed as a sequence ; 
and either a king or queen, with an ace, 
six, seven, eight, or nine, are good ones 
to put out. Low cards are generally 
the most likely to gain at play ; the 
flushes and sequences, particularly if 
the latter be also flushes, are, the most 
part, eligible hands, as thereby tn* 
player will often be enabled either to

251 



assist his own crib, or baulk that of the 
opponent, to whom a knave should 
never be given, if with propr'ety it can 
be retained. 

2109. THREE OR FOUR HAND CRIB- 
BAGE, Differs only from the preced- 
ing, as the parties put out but one card 
each to the crib, and when thirty- 
one, or near as can be, has been made, 
then the next eldest hand leads, and 
the players go on again in rotation, 
with any remaining cards, till all are 
played out before they proceed to show. 
For three-hand cribbage triangular 
boards are used. 

A sort of three-hand cribbage is some- 
times played, wherein one person sits 
out, not each game, but each deal in 
rotation. In this the first dealer gene- 
rally wins. 

The chances in this game are often so 
great that even between skilful game- 
sters, it is possible, at five-card cribbage, 
when the adversary is fifty-six, for a 
lucky player who had not previously 
made a single hole, to be more than up 
in two dciilfi; his opponent getting no 
further than sixty in that time ; and in 
four-hand cribbage a case may occur, 
wherein none of the parties hold a single 
point in hand, and yet the dealer and 
his friend, with the assistance of a knave 
turned up, may make sixty-one by play 
in one deal, while the adversary only 
gets twenty-four ; and although this may 
not happen for many years, yet similar 
games may now and then be met with. 

2110. SIX-CARD CKIBBAGE, varies from 
that played with five, as the players 
(always only two) commence on an 
equality without scoring any points 
for the last, retain four cards in hand 
and all the cards are to be played out, 
as in three and four-hand cribbage, with 
five cards. At this game it is of ad- 
vantage to the last player to keep as 
close as possible, in hopes of coming in 
for fifteen, a sequence, or pair, besides 
the end-hole, or thirty-one. The first 
dealer is reckoned to have some trifling 
advantage, and each player may, on the 
average, expect to make twenty-five 
points in eve - r two d^U The c a'st 

11* 



non-dealer is considered to have the 
preference, when he gains ten or more 
the first hand, the dealer not making 
more than his average number. 

Twenty-nine is the greatest possible 
number that can be gained by the show 
of any hand or crib, either in five or 
six-card cribbage ; it is -composed of 
three fives and a knave, with a fourth 
five, of the same suit as the knave turned 
up ; this very seldom happens ; but 
twenty-four is an uncommon number, 
and may be formed of four threes and a 
nine, or two fours, one five, and two 
sixes ; and some other combinations 
that experience will point out. 

2111. EIGHT-CARD CRIBBAGE, is some- 
times played, but very seldom. 

Some ingenious people, invented a 
game of chance, they styled playing at 
cribbage by hackney .-coaches ; that is, 
two persons placed themselves at a 
window in some great thoroughfare 
street, one would take all the coaches 
from the right, the other from the left ; 
the figures on the doors of the carriages 
Were reckoned as cards in show, and 
every person that happened to sit, 
stand, or hold at the back of any of them, 
was called a noddy, and scored one. 
2112. ODDS OF THE GAME. 

The average number estimated to be 
held from the cards in hand is rather 
more than four, and under five ; to be 
gained in play ; two foc,the dealer, and 
one for the adversary, making in all an 
average of six throughout the game ; 
the probability of the crib is five ; BO 
that each player ought to make sixteen 
in two deals ; by which it will appear 
the dealer has somewhat the advan- 
tage, supposing the cards to run equal, 
and the players well atched. By 
attending to this calculb -,ion, any per- 
son may judge whether h be at home 
or not, and thereby pla his game 
accordingly : either making a grand 
push when he is behind and holds 
good cards, or endeavouring to baulk 
his adversary when his hand proves 
indifferent. 

2113. ALL-FOURS is usually played 
by two persons : not unfrequently by 



252 



MUDDLE AT HOME MAKES THE HUSBAND ROAM. 



four Its name is derived from the 
four chances called high, low, Jack, 
gamt, each making a point. A com- 
plete pack of cards must be provided, 
six of which are to be dealt to each 
party, three at a time ; and the next 
card, the thirteenth, is to be turned up 
for the trump by the dealer, who, if it 
prove a knave, is to score one point. 
The party who cuts the highest card is 
to deal first. The cards rank in the 
same manner as at whist, for whoever 
scores the first ten points wins. 

2114. LAWS OF ALL-FOURS. 1. A 
new deal can be demanded, if in deal- 
ing the dealer discovers any of the 
adversary's cards ; if, to either party, 
too many cards have been dealt ; in the 
latter case it is optional with the 
parties, provided it be done before a 
card has been played, but not after, 
to draw from the opposing hand the 
extra card. 

2. If the dealer expose any of his 
own cards, the deal is to stand good. 

3. No person can beg more than 
once in each hand, except by mutual 
agreement. 

4. Each party must trump or fol- 
low suit if they can, on penalty of 
the adversary scoring one point. 

5. If either player score wrong-, it 
must be taken down, and the adversary 
shall either score four points or one, 
as may have previously been agreed. 

6. When a trump be played, it is 
allowable to ask the adversary if it be 
either high or low. 

7. One card may count all-fours ; for 
example, the eldest hand holds the 
knave and stands his game, the dealer 
has neither trump, ten, ace, nor court- 
card, it will follow that the knave will 
be both high, low, Jack, and game, as 
explained by 

2115. TERMS USED IN ALL- FOURS 
High, The highest trump out, the 
holder to score one point. 

Low, The lowest trump out, the 
original holder to score one point, 
even if it be taken by the adversary. 

Jack, The knar a of trumps, the 
holder to score one, unleas it bo won 



by the adversary, in that case the 
winner is to score the point. 

Game, The greatest number that, iu 
the trick gained, can be shown hy 
either party ; reckoning 

Four for an ace. I One for knave. 

Three for a king. Ten for a ten. 

Two for a queen. | 

The other cards do not count, thus 
it may happen that a deal may be 
played without having any to reckon 
for game. 

Begging is when the eldest hand, 
disliking his card, uses his privilege, 
and says, " I leg ;" in which case, the 
d >aler must either suffer his adversary 
t- *core one point, saying " take one,' ' 
o : give each three cards more from the 
pack, and then turn up the next card, 
the seventh, for trumps; if, however 
the trump turned up be of the same 
suit as the first, the dealer must go on, 
giving each three cards more, and 
turning up the seventh, until a 
change of suit for trumps shall take 
place. 

2116. MAXIMS. 1. Always make your 
knave as soon as you can. 

2. Strive to secure your tens: this is 
to be done by playing any small cards, 
by which you may throw the lead into 
your adversary's hand. 

3. Win your adversary's best cards 
when you can, either by trumping or 
with superior cards. 

4. If, being eldest hand, you hold 
either ace, king, or queen of trumps, 
without the knave or ten, play them 
immediately, as by this means, you have 
a chance to win the knave or ten. 

2117. DOMINO. This game is play- 
ed by two or four persons, with twenty- 
eight pieces of oblong ivory, plain at 
the back, but on the face divided by a 
black line in the middle, and indented 
with spots, from one to a double -six, 
which pieces are a double blank, ace- 
blank, double ace, deuce blank, deuce- 
ace, double-deuce, trois-blank, trois-ace, 
trois-deuce, double-trois, four-blank 
four-ace, four deuce, fbur-trois, double- 
four, five-blank, five-ace, five-deuce, 
feve-trois, five-four, double-five, si* 



A WAITING APPETITE KINDLES MANY A SPITE. 



253 



blank, six-ace, six-deuce, six-trois, six- 
four, six five, and double-six. Some 
times a double set is played with, of 
which double-twelve is the highest. 

At the commencement of the game, 
the dominoes are well mixed together, 
with their faces upon the table. Each 
person draws one, and if four play, 
those who choose the two highest are 
partners, against those who take the 
two lowest; drawing the latter also 
serves to determine who is to lay down 
the first piece, which is reckoned a 
great advantage. Afterwards each 
player takes seven pieces at random. 
The eldest hand having laid down one, 
the next must pair him at either end of 
the piece he may choose, according to 
the number of pips, or the blank in the 
compartment of the piece ; but when- 
ever any one cannot match the part, 
either of the domino last put down, or 
of that imp/tired at the other end of 
the row, then he says go ; and the next 
is at liberty to play. Thus they play 
alternately, either until one party has 
played all his pieces, and thereby won 
the game, or till the game be blocked; 
that is, when neither party can play, by 
matching the pieces where unpaired at 
either end ; then that party wins who 
has the smallest number of pips on the 
pieces remaining in their possession. It 
is to the advantage of every player to 
dispossess himself as early as possible 
of the heavy pieces, such as a double- 
six, five, four, &c. 

Sometimes, when two persons play, 
they take each only seven pieces, and 
agree to play or draw, i. e., when one 
cannot come in, or pair the pieces upon 
the board at the end unmatched, he 
then is to draw from the fourteen pieces 
in stock till he find one to suit. 

This game requires strict attention, 
and nothing but practice will make a 
skilful player. 

2118. LOO. Loo, or hie, is subdi- 
vided into limited and unlimited loo, is 
& game the complete knowledge of 
which can easily be acquired; it is 
played two ways, both with five and 
three cards, though most commonly 



with five, dealt from a vthole pack, 
either first three and then two, or by 
one at a time. Several persons may 
play together, but the greatest number 
can be admitted when with three cards 
only. 

After five cards have been given to 
each player another is turned up for 
trump ; the knave of clubs generally, 
or sometimes the knave of the trump 
suit, as agreed upon, is the highest card, 
and is styled pain ; the ace of trumps 
is next in value, and the rest in succes- 
sion as at whist. Each player has the 
liberty of changing for others, from the 
pack, all or any of the five cards dealt, 
or of throwing up the hand, in order to 
escape being looed. Those who play 
their cards, either with or without 
changing, and do not gain a trick, are 
looed ; as is likewise the case with all 
who have stood the game, when a flush 
or flushes occur ; and each, excepting 
any player holding pam, of an inferior 
flush, is required to deposit a stake, to 
be given to the person who sweeps the 
board, or divided among the winners at 
the ensuing deal, according to the tricks 
which may then be made. For instance, 
if every one at dealing stakes half-a 
dollar, the tricks are entitled to six- 
pence a piece, and whoever is looed 
must put down half-a-dollar, exclusive 
of the deal; sometimes it is settled 
that each person looed shall pay a sum 
equal to what happens to be on the 
table at the time. Five cards of a 
suit or four with pain, compose a flush, 
which sweeps the board and yields only 
to a superior flush, or the elder hand. 
When the ace of trumps is led, it is 
usual to say, "Pam, be civil; 1 ' the 
holder of which last mentioned card is 
then expected fo let the ace pass. 

When loo is played with three cards 
they are dealt by one at a time, pam ie 
omitted, and the cards are not ex- 
changed, nor permitted to be thrown 

u l 

2119. PUT. The game of put ia 
ph yed with an entire pack of cards, 
generally by two but sometimes by 
four persons. At this game the card*

EGGS BADLY BOILED ARE GOOD THINGS SPOILED. 



have a different value from all others. 
The best card in the pack is a t rots, or 
three , the next a deuce, or two ; then 
come in rotation, as at other games, 
the ace, king-, queen, knave, ten, &c. 
The dealer distributee three cards to 
each player, by one at a time : whoever 
cuts the lowest card has the deal, and 
live points make the game, except when 
both parties eay, " I put " for then 
the score is at an end, and the contest is 
determined in favour of that party 
who may win two tricks out of three. 
When it happens that each player has 
won a trick, and the third is a tie that 
is, covered by a card of equal value 
the whole goes for nothing, and the 
game must begin anew. 

2119*. TWO-HANDED PUT. The 
eldest hand should play a card ; and 
whether the adversary pass it, win it, 
or tie it, you have a right either to say, 
" I put," or place your cards on the pack. 
If you accept the first, and your oppo- 
nent decline the challenge, you score 
one: If you prefer the latter, your 
adversary gains a point ; but if, before 
he play, your opponent says, " I put," 
and you do not choose to see him, he is 
entitled to add one to his score. It is 
sometimes good play to say, "I put," 
before you play a card ; this depends 
on the nature of your hand. 

2120. FOUR-HANDED PUT. Each 
party has a partner, and when three 
cards are dealt to each, one of the 
players gives his partner his best card, 
and throws the other two away : the 
dealer is at liberty to do the same to 
his partner, and vice versa. The two 
persons who have received their part- 
ners' cards play the game, previously 
discarding their worst card for the one 
they have received from their partners. 
The game then proceeds as at two- 
handed put. 

2121. LAWS OP PUT. 1. When the 
dealer accidentally discovers any of his 
adversary's cards, the adversary may 
demand a new deal. 

2. When the dealer discovers any of 
his own cards in dealing, he must abide 
by the deal 



3. When a faced card is discovered 
during the deal, the cards must be re- 
shuffled, and dealt again. 

4. If the dealer gives his adversary 
more cards than are necessary, the 
adversary may call a fresh deal, or suffer 
the dealer to draw the extra cards from 
his hand. 

5. If the dealer give himself more 
cards than are his due, the adversary 
may add a point to his game, and call a 
fresh deal if he pleases, or draw the 
extra cards from the dealer's hand. 

6. No bystander must interfere, under 
penalty of paying the stakes. 

7. Either party saying, "I put" 
that is, I play cannot retract, but 
must abide the event of the game, or 
pay the stakes. 

2122. SPECULATION is a noisy 
round game, at which several may play, 
using a complete pack of cards, bearing 
the same import as at wL:?t, with fish 
or counters, on which sucL a value is 
fixed as the company may agree. The 
highest trump in each deal wins the 
pool; and whenever it happens that 
not one is dealt, then the company poo] 
again, and the event is decided by the 
succeeding coup. After determining 
the deal, &c., the dealer pools six fish, 
and every other player four ; then three 
cards are given to each, by one at 
a time, and another turned up for 
trump. The cards are not to be looked 
at except in this manner: the eldest 
hand shows the uppermost card, which, 
if a trump, the company may speculate 
on, or bid for the highest bidder buy- 
ing and paying for it, provided the price 
offered be approved of by the seller. 
After this is settled, if the first card 
does not prove a trump, then the next 
eldest is to show the uppermost card, 
and so on the company speculating as 
they please, till all are discovered, 
when the possessor of the highest 
truinp, whether by purchase or other- 
wise, gains the pool. To plav at specu- 
lation well, a recollection only is requi- 
site of what superior cards of that 
particular suit have appeared in the 
preceding deals, and calculating tha

i offered proving 
the highest in the deal then undeter- 
mined. 

2123. CONNEXIONS. Three or 
four persons may play at this game. 
If the former number, ten cards each 
are to be given ; but if the latter, only 
eight are dealt, and bear the same im- 
port as at whist, except that diamonds 
are always trumps. The connexions 
are formed as follows: 

1. By the tw black aces. 

2. The ace o" spades and king of 
hearts. 

3. The ace of clubs and king of 
hearts. 

For the first connexion 20cts. are 
drawn from the pool; for the second, 
lOcts. ; for the third, and by the win- 
ner of the majority of tricks, Sets, each 
is taken. These sums are supposing 
gold staked : when only silver is pooled, 
then pence are drawn. A trump played 
in any round where there is a connex- 
ion wins the trick, otherwise it is gained 
by the player of the first card of con- 
nexions; and, after a connexion, any 
following player may trump without 
incurring a revoke ; and also, whatever 
suit may be led, the person holding a 
card of connexion is at liberty to play 
the same ; but the others must, if pos- 
sible, follow suit, unless one of them 
can answer the connexion, which should 
be done in preference. No money can 
be drawn till the hands are finished; 
then the possessors of the connexions 
are to take first according to preced- 
ence, and those having the majority of 
tricks take last. 

2124. POPE JOAN. Pope, a game 
somewhat similar to that of matrimony, 
is played by a number of people, who 
generally use a board painted for this 
purpose, which may be purchased at 
most turners' or toy shops. The eight 
of diamonds must first be taken from 
the pack, and after settling the deal, 
shuffling, &c., the dealer dresses the 
board, by putting fish counters, or other 
stakes, one each to ace, king, queen, 
knave, and game ; two to matrimony, 
two to intrigue a d SIT k *-! 3 nine of 



diamonds, styled Pope. This dressing 
is, in some companies, at the individual 
expense of the dealer, though, in others, 
the players contribute two stakes 
a-piece towards the same. The cards 
are next to be dealt round equally to 
every player, one turned up for the 
trump, and about six or eight left in 
the stock to form stops; as, for example, 
if the ten of spades be turned up, the 
nine consequently becomes a stop ; the 
four kings and the seven of diamonds, 
are always fixed stops, and the dealer 
is the only person permitted, in the 
course of the game, to refer occasion- 
ally to the stock for information what 
other cards are stops in their respective 
deals. If either ace, king, queen, or 
knave happen to be the turned-up 
trump, the dealer may take whatever 
is deposited on that head ; but when 
pope be turned up, the dealer Is entitled 
both to that and the game, besides a 
stake for every card dealt to each 
player. Unless the game be deter- 
mined by pope being turned up, the 
eldest hand must begin by playing out 
as many cards as possible; first the 
stops, then pope, if he has it, and after- 
wards the lowest card of his longest 
suit, particularly an ace, for that never 
can be led through; the other players 
are to follow, when they can, in se- 
quence of the same suit, till a stop oc- 
curs, and the party having the stop 
thereby becomes eldest hand, and is to 
lead accordingly ; and so on, until some 
person part with all his cards, by which 
he wins the pool (game), and becomes 
entitled besides to a stake for every 
card not played by the others, except 
from any one holding pope, which ex- 
cuses him from paying; but if pope 
has been played, then the party having 
held it is not excused. King and queen 
form what is denominated matrimony ; 
queen and knave make intrigue, when 
'u the same hand ; but, neither these, 
ior ace, king, queen, knave, nor pope, 
entitle the holder to the stakes deposit- 
ed thereon, unless played out ; and no 
claim can be allowed after the board 
3e dressed for the succeeding deal ; but

TO OBTAIN COFFEE HOT, WELL WARM THE POT. 



in all such cases the stakes are to re- 
main for future determination. This 
game only requires a little attention to 
recollect what stops have been made in 
the course of the play ; as, for instance, 
it a player begin by laying down the 
eight of cl'ibs. then the seven in another 
liand forms a stop, whenever that suit 
be led from any lower card; or the 
holder, when eldest, may safely lay it 
down, in order to clear his hand. 

2125. MATRIMONY. The game 
of matrimony is played with an entire 
pack of cards, by any number of per- 
sons from five to fourteen. It consists 
of five chances, usually marked on a 
board, or sheet of paper, as follows : 

Besi. 
The Ace of Diamonds turned up.

fl 



This game is generally played with 
counters, and the dealer puts what he 
pleases on each or any chance, the other 
players depositing each the same quan- 
tity, except one that is, when the 
dealer stakes twelve, the rest of the 
company lay down eleven each. After 
this, two cards are dealt round to every 
one, beginning on the left ; then to each 
person one other card, which is turned 
up, and he who so happens to get the 
ace of diamonds sweeps all. If it be 
not turned up, then each player shows 
his hand; -and any of them having 
matrimony, intrigue, &c., takes the 
counters on that point; and when two 
or more people happen to have a simi- 
lar combination, the eldest hand has 
the preference ; and, should any chance 
ot be gained, it stands over to the 
t ext deal. Observe: The ace of dia- 
nonds turned up takes the whole pool, 
ut when in Lund ranks only as any 
other ace ; and if not turned up, nor 
any ace in hand, then the king, or next 
superior card, wij.s th chancf styled 
best. 



2126. CASSINO. The game of ca 
sino is played with an entire pack 01 
cards, generally by four persons, but 
sometimes by three, and often by two. 

2127. TERMS USED IN CASSINO. 
Great Cassino, the ten of diamonds, 
which reckons for two points. 

Little Cassino, the two of spades, 
which reckons for one point. 

The Cards is when you have a greater 
share than your adversary, and reckons 
for three points. 

The Spades is when you have the 
majority of that suit, and reckons for 
one point. 

The Aces : each of which reckons for 
one point. 

Lurched is when your adversary has 
won the game before you have gained 
six points. 

In some deals, at this game, it may so 
happen that neither party wins anything, 
as the points are not set up according 
to the tricks, &c., obtained; but the 
smaller number is constantly subtracted 
from the larger, both in cards and 
points ; and, if they both prove equal, 
the game commences again, and the 
deal goes on in rotation. When three 
persons play at this game, the two low- 
est add their points together, and sub- 
tract from the highest ; but when their 
two numbers together either amount 
to or exceed the highest, then neither 
party scores. 

2128. LAWS OF CASSINO. The deal 
and partners are determined by cut- 
ting, as at whist, and the dealer 
gives four cards, by one at a time, to 
svery player, and either regularly, as 
be deals, or by one, two, three, or four 
at a time, lays four more, face upwards, 
upon the board, and, after the first cards 
are played, four others are to be dealt 
to each person, until the pack be con- 
cluded ; but it is only in the first deal 
that any cards are to be turned up. 

The deal is not lost when a card i& 
faced by the dealer, unless in the first 
round, before any of the four cards are 
turned up upon the table ; but if a 
card happen to be faced in the pack, 
before any of the said four bo turned 



A DIRTY STOVE MAKES DINNER LATE. 



257 



ap, then the deal must be begun 
again. 

- Any person playing with less than 
four cards must abide by the loss ; and 
should a card be found under the table 
the player whose number is deficient is 
to take the same. 

Each person plays one card at a time, 
vith which he may not only take at 
nee every card of the same denomi- 
nation upon the table, but likewise all 
hat will combine therewith ; as, for 
nstance, a ten takes not only every ten, 
but also nine and ace, eight and deuce, 
seven and three, six and four, or two 
fives ; and if he clear the board before 
the conclusion of the game, he is to 
score a point, and whenever any player 
cannot pair or combine, then he is to 
put down a card. 

The number of tricks are not to be 
examined or counted before all the cards 
be played ; nor may any trick but that 
last won be looked at, as every mistake 
must be challenged immediately. 

After all the pack be dealt out, the 
player who obtains the last trick sweeps 
all the cards then remaining unmatched 
upon the table, 

2129. VINGT-UN. The game of 
Vingt-un, or twenty-one, may be played 
by two or more people ; and, as the 
deal is advantageous, and often con- 
tinues long with the same person, it is 
usual to determine it at the commence- 
ment by turning up the first ace, or 
any other mode that may be agreed upon. 
The cards must all be dealt out in 
succession, unless a natural Vingt-un 
occurs, and in the meantime the pone, 
or youngest hand, should collect those 
that have been played, and shuffle them 
together, ready for the dealer, against 
the period when he shall have dis- 
tributed the whole pack. The dealer 
is first to give two cards, by one at a 
time, to each player, including himself; 
then to ask eve~v person in rotation, 
beginning with tne eldest hand on the 
left, whether he stands or chooses 
another card, which, if required, must 
be given from off the top of the pack, 
and afterwards another, or more, if 



desired, till the points of the additional 
card or cards, added to those dealt, 
exceed or make twenty-one exactly, ot 
such a number less than twenty-one as 
may be judged proper to stand upon ; 
but when the points exceed twenty- 
one, then tke cards of that individual 
player are to be thrown up directly, 
and the stakes to be paid to the dealer, 
who also is, in turn, entitled to draw 
additional cards; and, on taking a 
Vingt-un, is to receive double stakes 
from all who stand the game, except 
such other players likewise having 
twenty-one, between whom it is thereby 
a drawn game ; and when any adversary 
has a Vingt-un, and the dealer not, then 
the opponent so having twenty-one, 
wins double stakes from him. In other 
cases, except a natural Vingt-un hap- 
pen, the dealer pays single stakes to all 
whose numbers under twenty-one are 
higher than his own. and receives from 
those who have lower numbers ; but 
nothing is paid or received by such 
players as have similar numbers to the 
dealers ; and when the dealer draws 
more than twenty-one, he is to pay to 
all who have not thrown up. 

Twenty-one, whensoever dealt in the 
first instance, is style-da Natural yingt- 
un, should be declared immediately, 
ind entitles the possessor to the deal, 
>esides double stakes from all the 
)layers, unless there shall be more than 
)ne natural Vingt-un ; in which case 
;he younger hand or hands, so having 
;he same, are excused from paying to 
'he eldest, who takes the deal of 
course. 

Observe : An ace may be reckoned 
either as eleven or one ; every court- 
sard is counted as ten, and the rest of 
he pack according to their points. 

The odds of this game merely depend 
ipon the average quantity of cards 
ikely to come under or exceed twenty 
ne : for example, if those in hand 
nake fourteen exactly, it ie seven to 
ix that the one next drawn does not 
nuke the number of points abovo 
wenty-one, but if the points be fifteen, 
t is seven to six against that hand v<** 



258 



A CHAIR UNSOUND WILL SOON FIND THE GROUND. 



it would not, therefore, always be 
prudent to stand at fifteen, for us th 
ace may be calculated both ways ; it if 
rather above an even bet that the ad 
versary's two first cards amount to 
more than fourteen. A natural Vingt- 
un may be expected once in seven 
coups, when two, and twice in seven 
when four people play, and so on, ac- 
eonling to the number of players. 

2130. QUADRILLE. The game o 
Quadrille is played by four persons : and 
the number of cards required are forty ; 
the four tens, nines, and eights, being 
discarded from the pack. The deal is 
made by distributing the cards to each 
player, three at a time for two rounds, 
and four at a time for one round ; 
commencing with the right-hand 
player, who is the eldest hand. 

The trump is made by the person 
who plays, with or without calling, by 
naming spades, clubs, diamonds, or 
hearts, and the suit named are trumps.

trumps, or when not so :

From those tables it will be observed 
that spadille and basto are always 
trumps: and that the red suits have 
one trump more than the black, the 
former twelve, and the latter only 
eleven. 

There is a trump between spadille 
and basto, which is called manille, and 
is in black the deuce, and in red the 
seven : they are the second cards when 
trumps, and the last in their respective 
suits when not trumps. Example : the 
deuce of spades being second trump, 
when they are trumps, and the lowest 
card when clubs, hearts, or diamonds 
are trumps, and so of the rest. 

Punto is the ace of hearts or dia- 
monds which are above the king, and 
the fourth trump, when either of those 
suits are trumps, but are below the 
knave, and ace of diamonds or hearts 
when they are not trumps. The two 
of hearts or diamonds is always supe- 
rior to the three ; the three to the four ; 
the four to the five ; and the five to the 
six ; the six is only superior to the seven 
when it is not trumps, for when the 
seven is manille, it is the second 
trump. 

There are three matadores, viz., 
spadille, manille, and basto : whose priv- 
ilege is, when the player has no other 
trumps but them, and trumps are led, 
be is not obliged to play them, but may- 
play what card he thinks proper, prr 
ided, however, that the trump led is 
of an inferior value; but, if spadille 
should be led, he that has manille, or 
tmsto only, is compelled to lead it, which 
s the case with basto in respect to ma- 
nille, the superior matadore always 
forcing the inferior. 

Terms used in Quadrille. 

To ask leave is to ask leave to play 
with a partner, by calling a king. 

Basto is the ace of clubs, and alwayi 
;he third best trump. 

Bast is a penalty incurred by not 
winning when you stand your game, or 
>y renouncing ; in which cases you pay 
as many counters as are down.

a suit is played, of which the player 
has the king. 

Manille is, in black, the deuce of 
spades or clubs ; in red the seven of 
hearts or diamonds, and is always the 
second best trump. 

Mark means the fish put down by 
the dealer. 

Mille is a mark of ivory which is 
sometimes used, and stands for ten 
fish. 

Matadores, or matts, are spadille, 
manille, and baeto, which are always 
the three best trumps. False mata- 
dores are any sequence of trumps, fol- 
lowing- the matadores regularly.

not either a hand to play alone, or with 
calling a king. 

Ponto or Punto, is the ace of dia- 
monds, when diamonds are trumps ; or 
hearts, when they are trumps, and is 
then the fourth trump. 

Pool. The pool consists of the fishes, 
which are staked for the deals, or the 
counters put down by the players, or 
the basts which go to the game. To 
defend the pool is to be agains^ him 
who stands the game. 

Prise is the number of fish or coun- 
ters given to each player at the com- 
mencement of the game. 

Regie is the order to be observed at 
the game. 

Remise is when they who stand tho 
game do not make more tricks than 
they who defend the pool, and then

led when you have it ; likewise, when 
not having any of the suit led, you win 
with a card that is the only one you 
have of that suit in which you are 
playing. 

Reprise is synonymous with party 

Report is synonymous with reprme 
and party. 

Roi Rendu is the king surrendered 
when called and given to the ombre, 
for which he pays a fish; in which case, 
the person to whom the game is given 
up, must w T in the game alone. 

Spadille is the ace of spades, which 
is always the best trump. 

Sans Appeller is playing without call- 
ing a king. 

Saws Prendre is erroneously used for 
sans appeller, meaning the same. 

Tenace is to wait with two trumps 
that must make when he that has two 
others is obliged to lead, such as the 
two black aces against manille or 
punto. 

Tours are the counters, which they 
who win put down, to mark the num- 
ber of coups played. 

Vole is to get all the tricks, eithof 
with a friend or alone, sans prendre, 01 
de^.ared at the first of the deal.

cards, it is also a new deal. 

3. No penalty is inflicted for dealing 
wrong, but the dealer must deal again. 

4. He who asks leave must play. 
5.^o one should play out of his

either of the adversaries may demand 
the partner of him who played out of 
his turn, or his own partner, to play 
any suit he thinks fit. 

6. No matadore can be forced but by 
a superior matt ; but the superior forces

8. If you play with eleven cards you

alays out of his turn, no vole can be 
clayed. 

16. No one is to be basted for a re- 
nounce, unless the trick is turned and

lappen to be basted by such renounce, 
all the parties are to take up their cards 
and play them over again. 

17. Forced spadille is not obliged to

2133.* RULES FOB LEARJCERS. When 
you are the ombre, and your friend 
leads from a matt, play your best trumn 



A LETTER-BOX SAVES MANY KNOCKS. 



261 



and then lead the next best the first 
opportunity. 

If you possess all the trumps, con- 
tinue to lead them, except you hold 
certain other winning cards. 

If all the other matts are not re- 
vealed by the tizue you have six tricks, 
do not run a risk in playing for the 
vole. 

When you are the friend called, and 
hold only a mutt, lead it ; but if it is 
guarded by a smali trump, lead that. 
But when the ombre is last player, lead 
the best trump you possess. 

Punto in red, or king of trumps in 
black, are good cards to lead when you 
are best; and should either of them 
succeed, then play a small trump. 

If the ombre leads to discover his 
friend, and you have king, queen, and 
knave, put on the knave. 

Preserve the suit called, whether 
friend or foe. 

When playing- against a lone hand, 
never lead a king, unless you have the 
queen ; or change the suit : and pre- 
vent, if possible, the ombre from being 
last player. 

You are to call your strongest suits, 
except you have a queen guarded ; and 
if elder hand, you have a better chance 
than middle hand. 

A good player may play a weaker 
game^ either elder or younger, than 
middle hand. 

2134. QUINZE. This game is 
usually played by only two persons, 
and is much admired for its simplicity 
and fairness, as it depends entirely 
upon chance, is soon decided, and does 
not require that attention which most 
other games do. It is, therefore, par- 
ticularly calculated for those who love 
to sport upon an equal chance. 

Quwize is a French game, and is so 
called from fifteen being the game, 
which must be made as follows : 

1. The cards must be shuffled by the 
two players, and when they have cut 
for deal," which falls to the lot of him 
who cuts the lowest, the dealer has the 
liberty at this, as well as all other 
games, to ahuffle them again 



2. When this is done, the adversary 
cuts them ; after which, the dealer 
gives one card to his opponent, and one 
to himself. 

3. Should the dealer's adversary not 
approve of his card, he is entitled to 
have as many cards given to him, one 
after the other, as will make fifteen, or 
come nearest to that number ; which 
are usually given from the top of the 
pack : for example if he should have 
a deuce, and draw a five, which amounts 
to seven, he must continue going on, in 
expectation of coming nearer to fifteen 
If he draw an eight, which will make 
just fifteen, he, as being eldest hand, is 
sure of winning the game. But if he 
overdraw himself, and make more than, 
fifteen, he loses, unless the dealer should 
happen to do the same ; which circum- 
stance constitutes a draw game ; and 
the stakes are consequently doubled. 
In this manner they persevere, until 
one of them has won the game, by 
standing and being nearest to fifteen. 

4. At the end of each game the cards 
are packed and shuffled, and the players 
again jjut for deal.

side of the elder hand. (See 161.) 

2J35. THE WEATHER AND THE 
BLOOD. In dry, sultry weather the 
heat ought to be counteracted by 
means of a cooling diet. To this pur- 
poce, cucumbers, melons, and juicy 
fruit are subservient. We ought to 
give the preference to such alimentary 
substances as lead to contract the juices 
which are too much expanded by the 
heat, and the property is possessed by 
all acid food and drink. To this ciass 
belong all sorts of salad, lemons, 
oranges, pomegranates sliced and 
sprinkled with sugar, for the acid of 
this fruit is not so apt to derange the 
stomach as that of lemons: also cherries 
and strawberries, curds turned with 
lemon acid or cream of tartar : cream 
of tartar dissolved in water lemonade 
and Khenish or Moselle wine mixed 
with water. 

2136. A LEMONADE, composed 01 
two bottles "f champagne, one bottl* 



262 



A BE1.L HUNG WELL ITS TALE WILL TELL. 



of seltzer water, three pomegranates, 
three lemons, and of sugar quantum 
sitfficit, is a princely beverage in hot 
weather ; only care must be taken that 
the perspiration is not thereby too much 
encouraged. 

2137. SUMMER CHAMPAGNE. 
To four parts of eelter water add one 
of Moselle wine (or hock), and put a 
tea- spoon ful of powdered sugar into a 
wine-glassful of this mixture ; an ebulli- 
tion takes place, and you have a sort of 
champagne which is more wholesome 
in hot weather than the genuine wine 
known by that name. 

2138. OUR ATTENTION ought to 
be directed to the means of thinning 
the blood, when it has been deprived 
by too profuse transpiration, in hot, dry 
winde, of its aqueous particles and ren- 
dered thick and viscid. Water would 
easily supply this want of fluidity if it 
were capable of mingling with the blood 
when in this state ; acid matter cannot 
be ultimately combined with the blood 
when the body is in this state. In 
order to find a menstruum by which 
water may be rendered capable of com- 
bining ultimately with the blood of 
remaining long in combination with it 
and of thinning it, we must mix it 
with a substance possessing the prop- 
erty of a soap, and consequently fit 
to dissolve viscous matters, and make 
them unite with water. The eoap must 
contain but little salt, that it may not 
increase the thirst of the parched 
throat. It must not have a disagreeable 
taste, that we may be able to drink a 
considerable quantity of it : and it 
must be capable of recruiting the 
strength without overloading the sto- 
mach. Now all these qualities are to 
be found in the yolk of egg. No bever- 
age therefore is more suitable (whilst 
it is very agreeable) for hot, dry wea- 
ther than one composed of the yolk of 
egg beaten up with a little sugar (quan- 
tum sujjicit for taste) and mixed with 
a quart of cool spring or filtered water, 
half a glass of Moselle or any other 

Rhenish wine, and some lemon juice. 

f he wine, however, may be omitted, 



and lemon juice alone (and rathei 
more) used. In like manner hartfrhorn 
shavings, boiled in water, may be sub- 
stituted for the yolk of egg ; equal 
quantities of beef tea and whey are 
ood for delicate infants. 
2139. SUBSTITUTE FOR THE 
FOREGOING. The yolk of eggi 
beaten up, lump sugar (quantum sufficit), 
Rhenish wine or not, citric acid, pow- 
dered, or tartaric acid (small quantity 
exact quantity soon found) ; one or two 
drops of essence of lemon on a lump o! 
sugar, to make it mix readily with the 
water ; one quart of water. This is 
really an excellent, agreeable, and, with- 
out the wine, an inexpensive beverage. 

2140. AGREEABLE EFFER- 
VESCENT DRINK FOR HEART- 
BURN, &c. Orange juice (of one 
orange) water and lump sugar to flavor, 
and in proportion to acidity of orange, 
bicarbonate of soda, about half a tea- 
spoonful. Mix orange juice, water and 
sugar together in a tumbler, then put 
in the soda, stir, and the effervescence 
ensues. 

2141. DEAFNESS. Take three 
drops of a sheep's gall, warm, and drop 
it into the ear on going to bed. The 
ear must be thoroughly syringed with 
warm soap and water in the morning. 
The gall must be applied for three 
successive nights. It is only effic/icSouB 
when the deafness is produced by cold. 
The most convenient way of warming 
the gall is by holding it in a silver 
spoon over the flame of a candle. The 
above remedy has been frequently tried 
with perfect success. 

2142. SWEEPING CARPETS. 
Persons who are accustomed to use tea 
leaves for sweeping their carpets, and 
find that they leave stains, will do well 
to employ fresh cut grass instead. It 
is better than tea leaves for preventing 
dust, and gives the carpets a very 
bright, fresh look. 

2143. THE ROUGH AND 
READY NIGHT-CAP, made in a 
moment, costing nothing, and admira- 
ble for railway and other travellers. 
Take your \>ocket-bandkerchief. and 



THE HEALTHIEST FEAST COSTS T11K LEAST. 



laying it out the full square, double 
down one-third over the other part. 
Then raise the whole and turn it over, 
BO that the third folded down shall now 
be underneath. Then take hold of one 
of the folded corners, and draw its point 
towards the centre ; then do the same 
with the other, as in making a cocked- 
hat, or a boat, of paper. Then take 
hold of the two remaining corners, and 
twisting the hern of the handkerchief, 
continue to roll it until it meets the 
doubled corners brought to the centre, 
and catches th'em up a little. Lift the 
whole and you will see the form of a 
cap, which will cover the head 
and ears, and being tied under the chin, 
will not come off. Very little practice 
will enable you to regulate the size of 
the folds, so as to suit the head. 

2144. MOCK GOOSE (being a leg 
of pork skinned, roasted, and stuffed 
goose fashion). Parboil the leg; take 
off the skin, and then put it down to 
roast ; baste it with butter, and make a 
savoury poicder of finely minced or 
dried and powdered sage, ground black 
pepper, salt and some bread-crumbs, 
rubbed together through a colander: 
you may add to this a little very finely- 
minced onion ; sprinkle it with this 
when it is almost roasted ; put a half 
pint of made gravy into the dish, and 
goose stuffing under the knuckle skin ; 
or garnish the dish with balls of it 
frk'd or boiled. 

2145. TINCTURE OF LEMON- 
PEEL. A very easy and economical 
way of obtaining and preserving the 
flavour of Lemon-peel, is to fill a wide- 
mouthed pint bottle half full of brandy, 
or proof spirit ; and when you use a 
lemon pare the rind off very thin, and 
piit it into the brandy, &c. : in a fort- 
night it will impregnate the spirit with 
the llavour very strongly. 

2146. RELISHING RASHERS 
OF BACON. If you have any cold 
bacon, you may make a very nice dish 
of it by cutting it into slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; grate some 
crust of bread as directed for ham, and 
powder them well with it on both sides : 



lay the rashers in a cheese tester, 
they will be browned on one side in 
about three minutes : turn them and 
do the other. These are a delicious 
accompaniment to poached or fried 
eggs: the bacon having been boiled 
first, is tender and mellow. They are 
an excellent garnish round veal cutlets, 
or sweet-breads, or calf s head hash, or 
green peas, or beans, &c. 

2147. RUMP-STEAK PIE. Cut 
three pounds of rump-steak (that has 
been kept till tender) into pieces half 
as big as your hand, trim off all the 
skin, sinews, and every part which has 
not indisputable p retentions to be 
eaten, and beat them with a chopper. 
Chop very fine half a dozen eschalots, 
and add them to half an ounce of 
pepper and salt mixed, strew some of 
the mixture at the bottom of the dish, 
then a layer of steak, then some more 
of the mixture^ and BO on till the dish 
is full; add half a gill of mushroom 
catsup, and the same quantity of 
gravy, or red wine ; cover it as in the 
preceding receipt, and bake it two 
hours. Large oysters, parboiled, beard- 
ed, and laid alternately with the steaks, 
their liquor reduced and substituted 
instead of the catsup and wine, will 
be a variety. 

2143. RAISED PIES. Put two 
pounds and a half of flour on the paste- 
board, and put on the fire, in a sauce- 
pan, three quarters of a pint of water, 
and half a pound of good lard ; when 
the water boils, make a hole in the 
middle of the flour, pour in the water 
and lard by degrees, gently mixing the 
flour with it with a spoon, and when it 
is well mixed, then knead it with your 
hands till it becomes stiff; dredge a 
little flour to prevent its sticking to 
the board, or you cannot make it look 
smooth : do not roll it with the rolling- 
pin but roll it with your hands, about 
the thickness of a quart-pot; cut it into 
six pieces, leaving a little for the cov- 
ers, put one hand in the middle, and 
keep the other close on the outside till 
you have worked it either in an oval or 
a round shape : have your meat ready 



264 



MUDDLE AT HOME MAKES THE HUSBAND ROAM. 



cut, awl seasoned with pepper and salt : 
If pork, cut it in small slices : the 
griskin is the best for pasties: if you 
use mutton, cut it in very neat cutlets, 
and put them in the pies as you make 
them ; roll out the covers with the 
rolling-pin just the size of the pie, wet 
it round the edge, put it on the pie, and 
press it together with your thumb and 
finger, and then cut it all round with 
a pair of scissors quite even, and pinch 
them inside and out, and bake them an 
hour and a half. 

2149. RELISH FOR CHOPS, &c. 
Pound fine an ounce of black pepper, 

and half an ounce of allspice, with an 
ounce of salt, and half an ounce of 
scraped horseradish, and the same of 
eschalots, peeled and quartered ; put 
these ingredients into a pint of mush- 
room catsup, or walnut pickle, and 
let them steep for a fortnight, and then 
strain it. 

Obs. A teaspoonful or two of this 
is generally an acceptable addition, 
mixed with the gravy usually sent up 
for chops and steaks; or added to thick 
melted butter. 

2150. ESSENCE OF MUSH- 
ROOM. This delicate relish is made 
by sprinkling a little ealt over either 
flap or button mushrooms ; three hours 
after, mash them, next day, strain off 
the liquor that will flow from them, 
put it into a stew-pan, and boil it till it 
is reduced to half. It will not keep 
long, but is preferable to any of the 
catsups, which in order to preserve 
them, must have spice, &c., which over- 
powers the, flavour of the mushrooms. 
An artificial mushroom bed will supply 
this all the year round. 

2151. ARTIFICIAL MUSH- 
ROOM BEDS. Mushrooms may be 
grown in pots, boxes, or hampers. 
Each box may be three feet long, one 
and a half broad, and seven inches in 
depth. Let each box be half filled with 
horse-dung from the stables (the fresher 
the better, and if wet to be dried for 
three or four days before it is put into 
the boxes) ; the dung is to be well 
beat down in the box. After the 



second or third day, if any heat hat 
arisen amongst the dung, break each 
spawn brick into three parts as equally 
as possible, then lay the pieces about 
four inches apart upon the surface of 
the dung in the box ; here they are to 
lie for six days, when it will probably 
be found that the side of the spawn 
next to the dung has begun to run in 
the dung below ; then add one and a 
half inch more of fresh dung on the top 
of the spawn in the box, and beat it 
down as formerly. In the course of a 
fortnight, when you find that the spawn 
has run through the dung, the box will 
be ready to receive the mould on the 
top ; this mould must be two and a half 
inches deep, well beat down, and the 
surface made quite even. In the space 
of five or six weeks the mushrooms 
will begin to come up; if then the 
mould seems dry, give a gentle water 
ing with lukewarm water. The box 
will continue to produce from six 
weeks to two months, if duly attended 
to by giving a little water when dry, 
for they need neither light nor free 
air. If cut as button mushrooms, each 
box will yield from twenty-four to forty 
eight pints, according to the season and 
other circumstances. They may be 
kept in dry dark cellars, or any other 
places where the frost will not reach 
them. And by preparing, in succession 
of boxes, mushrooms may be had all 
the year through. They may be grown 
without the dung, and be of a finer fla- 
vour. Take a little straw, and lay it 
carefully in the bottom of the mush- 
room-box, about an inch thick, or rather 
more. Then take some of the spawn 
bricks and break them down each 
brick into about ten pieces, and lay the 
fragments on the straw, as close to each 
other as they will lie. Cover them up 
with mould three and a half inches 
deep, and well pressed down. When 
the surface appears dry, give a little 
tepid water, as directed for the List 
way of raising them ; but this method 
needs about double the quantity of 
water that the former does, owing to 
having no moisture in the bottom, whil 



YOU MAY DEPEND THE DUSTMAN IS YOUR FRIEND. 



265 



ttie other has the dung. The mush 
rooms will begin to start in a month or 
five weeks, sometimes sooner, some- 
times later, according to the heat of 
the place where the boxes are situated. 
The spawn bricks may be obtained 
from seedsmen, or be collected from 
meadows. 

2152. GOOSE OR DUCK STUFF- 
ING. Chop very fine about two ounces 
of onion, of green sage leaves about an 
ounce (both unboiled), four ounces of 
bread-crumbs, a bit of butter about as 
big as a walnut, &c., the yolk and 
white of an egg, and a little pepper and 
salt ; some add to this a minced apple. 

2153. ROAST GOOSE. When a 
goose is well picked, singed, and clean 
ed, make the stuffing with about two 
ounces of onion (if you think the flavour 
of raw onions too strong-, cut them in 
slices, and lay them in cold water for a 

' couple of hours, or add as much apple 
or potato as you have of onion), and 
half as much green sage ; chop them 
very fine, adding four ounces i. e. , about 
a large breakfast cupful of stale bread 
crumbs, a bit of butter about as big ns 
a walnut, and very little pepper and 
salt (to this some cooks add half the 
liver, parboiling it first), the yolk of 
an egg or two, and incorporating the 
whole well together, stuff the goose; 
do not quite fill it, but leave a little 
room for the stuffing to swell. Spit it, 
tie it on the spit at both ends, to pre- 
vent it swinging round, and to prevent 
the stuffing from coming out. From an 
hour and a half to an hour and three 
quarters will roast a fine full-grown 
goose. Send up gravy and apple- sauce 
with it. 

2154. SAGE AND ONION, OR 
GOOSE-STUFFING SAUCE Chop 
very fine one ounce of onion and half 
an ounce of green sage leaves, put 
them into a stew-pan with four spoon- 
fuls of water, simmer gently for ten 
minutes, then put in a tea-spoonful of 
pepper and salt, and one ounce of fine 
bread crumbs; mix well together; 
then pour to it a quarter of a pint of 
broth, or gravy, or melted butter, stir 



well together, and simmer it a few min- 
utes longer. This is a very relishing 
sauce for roast pork, poultry, geese, 01 
ducks ; or green peas. 

2155. APPLE SAUCE. Pare and 
core three good-sized baking apples, 
put them into a well-tinned pint sauce- 
pan, with two table-spoonfuls of cold 
water; cover the saucepan close, and 
set it on trivet over a slow fire a couple 
of hours before dinner, some apples 
will take a long time stewing, others 
will be ready in a quarter of an hour: 
when the apples are done enough, pour 
off the water, let them stand a few 
minutes to get dry ; then beat them up 
with a fork, with a bit of butter about 
as big us a nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful 
of powdered sugar. Some add lemon- 
peel, grated, or minced fine, or boil a 
bit with the apples. Some are fond ol 
apple sauce with cold pork. 

2156. BEEF GRAVY SAUCE 
( Or Brown Sauce, for Ragout, Game, 
Poultry, Fish, Sfc.,) If you want gravy, 
furnish a thick and well-tinned stewpan 
with a thin slice of fat ham or bacon, 
or an ounce of butter, and a middling 
sized onion; on this lay a pound of 
nice juicy gravy beef (as the object in 
making gravy is to extract the nutri- 
tious succulence of the meat; it must 
be beaten to comminute the containing 
vessels, and scored to augment the sur- 
face to the action of the water), cover 
the stewpan, set it on a slow fire ; when 
the meat begins to brown, turn it about, 
and let it be slightly browned (but talu 
care it is not at all burnt) : then pour 
in a pint and a half of boiling water, 
set the pan on the fire ; when it boils, 
carefully catch the scum, and then 
put in a crust of bread toasted brown 
(don't burn it) a sprig of winter sa- 
voury, or lemon thyme and parsley a 
roll of thin-cut lemon peel, a dozen 
berries of allspice, and a dozen of black 
pepper, cover the stew-pan close, let it 
steio very gently for about two hours, 
ihen strain it through a sieve into a 
3a sin. If you wish to thicken it, set a 
clean stew-pan over a slow fire, with 
about an ounce of butter in it ; wheu 



266 



FIRE IS A GOOD SERVANT BUT A BAD MASTER. 



it is melted, dredge to it (by degrees) 
as much flour as will dry it up, stirring 
them well together; when thoroughly 
mixed, pour in a little of the gravy, 
stir it well together, and add the re- 
mainder by degrees; set it over the 
fire, let it simmer gently for fifteen or 
twenty minutes longer, and skim off 
the fat, &c., as it raises: when it is 
about as thick as cream, squeeze it 
through a tamis or fine sieve, and you 
will have a fine rich brown sauce, at a 
very moderate expense, and without 
much trouble. Obs. If you wish to 
make it still more relishing, for Poul- 
try, you may pound the liver with a bit 
of butter, rub it through a sieve, and 
stir it into the sauce when yo\i put in 



the thickening. 
2157. BEEF ALAMODE 



AND 



VEAL DITTO. Take about eleven 
pounds of the mouse buttock, or clod 
of beef, or blade-bone, or the stick- 
ing-piece, or the like weight of the 
breast of veal ; cut it into pieces of 
thr^e or four ounces each ; put three or 
four ounces of beef dripping, and mince 
a couple of large onions, and put them 
into a large deep stew-pan : as soon as 
it is ^uite hot, flour the meat, put it 
into the stew-pan, keep stirring it with 
a wooden spoon; when it has been on 
ibout ten minutes, dredge it with flour, 
and keep doing so till you have stirred 
in as mucn as you think will thicken 
it; then cover it with boiling water (it 
will take about a gallon), adding it by 
degrees, and stirring it together; skim 
it when it boils, and then put in one 
drachm, of ground black pepper, two 
of allspice, and two bay -leaves; set the 
pan by the side of the fire, or at a dis- 
tance over it, and let stew very slowly 
for about three hours; when you >d 
the meat sufficiently tender, put it into 
a tureen, and it is ready for table. 

2158. WALNUT CATSUP. Take 
six half-sieves of green walnut shells, 
put them into a tub, mix them up 



well with common salt, 
three pounds, let them 



soft and pulpy, then by banking it up 
on one side of the tub, and at the same 
time by raising the tub on that side, 
the liquor will drain clear off to the 
other; then take that liquor out: the 
mashing and banking up may be re- 
peated as oi'ten as liquor is found. The 
quantity will be about six quarts. 
When done, let it be simmered in an 
iron boiler as long as any scum arises ; 
then bruise a quarter of a pound of 
ginger, a quarter of a pound of allspice, 
and two ounces of long pepper, two 
ounces of cloves, with the above ingre- 
dients, let it slowly boil for half an hour; 
when bottled let an equal quantity of 
the spice go into each bottle; when 
corked, let the bottles be filled quite 
up : cork them tight, seal them over, 
and put them into a cool and dry place 
for one year before they are used. 

2J59. CURIOUS PROPERTIES OF THE 
NUMBER NINE. If any row of two or 
more figures be reversed and subtracted 
from itself, the figures composing the 
remainder, will, when added horizon- 
tally, be a multiple of nine :

2160. YEAST. Boil, say on Monday 
morning, 2 oz. of the best hops in four 
quarts of water, for half-an-hour ; strain 
it, and let the liquor cool down to new 
milk warmth ; then put in a small hand- 
ful of salt and half a pound of sugar : 
beat up one pound of" the best flour 
with some of the liquor, and then mix 
well all together. On Wednesday add 
three pounds of potatoes boiled and 
then mashed, to stand till Thursday ; 
then strain it, and put it into bottles, 
and it is ready for use . It must be stirred 
frequently while it is making, and kept 
near thejire. Before using, shake the 
bottle up well. It will keep in a cool 
place for two months, and is best at the 
latter part of the time. The beauty ol 
from two to this yeast is that it ferments sponta 
stand for six neously, not requiring the aid of other 
days, frequently beating and mashing yeast; and if care be taken to let it fer- 
them; by this time the shells become] ment well in the earthen bowl in which

it ii made, you may cork it up tight 
when bottled. The quantity above 
given will fill four seltzer-water bottles. 
The writer of the above receipts has used 
this yeast for many months, and never 
had lighter bread than it affords, and 
never knew it to fail. 

2161, FORCEMEAT BALLS (for 
turtle, mock turtle, or made dishes). 
Pound some veal in a marble mortar, 
rub it through a sieve with as much of 
the udder as you have veal, or about a 
third of the quantity of butter ; put 
some bread-crumbs into a stew-pan, 
moiiS'ten them with milk, add a little 
chopped parsley and eschalot, rub them 
well together in a mortar, till they form 
a smooth paste ; put it through a sieve, 
and when cold, pound, and mix all toge- 
ther, with the yolks of three eggs 
boiled hard ; season it with salt, pepper, 
and curry powder, or cayenne, add to it 
the yolks of two raw eggs, rub it well 
together, and make small balls ; ten 
minutes before your soup is ready, put 
them in. 

2162. SYRUP OF ORANGE OR 
LEMON- PEEL. Of fresh outer rind 
of Seville orange or lemon-peel, three 
ounces, apothecaries' weight ; boiling 
water, a pint and a-half ; infuse them 
for a night in a close vessel : then strain 
the liquor ; let it stand to settle ; and 
having poured it off clear from the 
sediment, dissolve in it two pounds of 
double-refined loaf sugar, and make it 
into a syrup with a gentle heat. 

2163. HORSERADISH VINEGAR. 
Pour a quart of best vinegar on three 
ounces of scraped horseradish, an ounce 
of minced eschalot, and one drachm of 
cayenne ; let it stand a week, and you 
will have an excellent relish for cold 
beef, salad, &c., costing scarcely any- 
thing. Horseradish is in highest per- 
fection about November. 

2164. CRESS VINEGAR. Dry and 
pound half an ounce of cress-sesd (such 
as is sown in the garden with mustard), 
pour upon it a quart of the best vinegar, 
let it steep ten days, shaking it up every 
day. This is very strongly flavored 
with cress, and for salads, and cold 
12 



meats, &c., it is a great favorite with 
many ; the quart of sauce costs only a 
halfpenny more than the v negar. 
Celery vinegar may be made in the 
same manner. 

2165. COCOANUT PIE. Cut off 
the brown part of the cocoanut, grate 
the white part, and mix it with milk, 
and set it on the fire and let it boil 
slowly eight or ten minutes. To a 
pound of the grated cocoanut allow a 
quart of milk, eight eggs, four table- 
spoonsful of sifted white sugar, a glass 
of wine, a small cracker, pounded fine, 
two spoonsful of melted butter, and half 
a nutmeg. The eggs and sugar should 
be beaten together to a froth, then the 
wine stirred in. Put them into the 
milk and cocoanut, which should be 
first allowed to get quite cool ; add the 
cracker and nutmeg, turn the whole 
into deep pie-plates, with a lining and 
rim of puft' paste. Bake them as soon 
as turned into the plates. 

2166. A NICE WAY of serving up 
a fowl that has been dressed. Beat the 
white of two eggs to a thick froth ; add 
a small bit of butter, or some salad oil, 
flour, a little lukewarm water, and two 
tablespoonfuls of beer, beaten alto- 
gether till it is of the consistency of 
very thick cream. Cut up the fowl 
into small pieces, strew over it some 
chopped parsley and shalot, pepper, 
salt, and a little vinegar, and let it lie 
till dinner time; dip the fowl in the 
batter, and fry it in boiling lard, of a 
nice light brown. Veal that has been 
cooked may be dressed in the same 
way. The above is a genuine family 
receipt, long practised by a French ser- 
vant. 

2167. CURRY POWDER, (agenu 
ine Indian receipt.) Turmeric, cori- 
ander, black pepper, four ounces each : 
Fennigreek, three ounces ; ginger, two 
ounces ; cummin seed, ground rice, 
one ounce each ; cayenne pepper, car- 
damoms, half an ounce each. 

2168. ANOTHER CURRY POW- 
DER. Coriander, twelve ounces ; black 
pepper six ounces ; turmeric, four 
ounces and three quarters , cummin 



268 



A SPARK MAT RAISE AN AWFUL BLAZE. 



seed three ounces ; cayenne one ounce 
and a-half ; ground rice, one ounce ; 
cardamoms, half an ounce ; cloves, 
quarter of an ounce. I have found it 
best to have the above receipts prepared 
at my chemist's. 

2169. BOILED RICE FOR CURRY. 
Put the rice down in cold water, and 
let it come to a boil for a minute or so ; 
strain it quite dry, and lay it on the 
bob in a stewpan without a cover to 
let the steam evaporate, then shake it 
into the dish while very hot. A squeeze 
of lemon juice after it boils will make 
it separate better. The three last re- 
ceipts were give me by a lady who had 
passed the greater part of her life in 
India, and who had them from native 
cooks. 

2J70. INDIAN SYRUP. (A deli- 
cious summer drink.) Five pounds cf 
lump sugar, two ounces of citric acid, 
a gallon of boiling water: when cold 
add half a drachm of essence of lemon, 
and half a drachm of spirits of wine ; 
stir it well, and bottle it. About two 
table- spoonfuls to a glass of cold water. 

2171. CHUTNEY. One pound of 
salt, one pound of mustard seed, one 
pound of stoned raisins, one pound of 
brown sugar, twelve ounces of garlic, 
six ounces of cayenne pepper, two 
quarts of unripe gooseberries, two quarts 
of best vinegar. The mustard seed, 
gently dried and bruised ; the sugar 
made into a syrup with a pint of the 
vinegar; the gooseberries dried and 
boiled in a quart of the vinegar; the 
garlic to be well bruised, in a mortar. 
When cold gradually mix the whole in 
a large mortar, and with the remaining 
vinegar thoroughly amalgamate them. 
To be tied down clos^, the longer 
kept the better. This is excellent. 

2172. CURING OF HAMS AND 
BACON. It is simply to use the same 
quantity of common soda as saltpetre 
one ounce and a half of each to the 
fourteen potinds of ham or bacon, using 
the usual quantity of salt. The soda 
prevents that hardness in the lean of 
ike bacon which is so often found, and 



keeps it quite mellow al. through, 
besides being a preventive of reast. 
This receipt has been very extensively 
tried amongst my acquaintance for the 
last fifteen years, and inv-ariably ap- 
proved. 

2173. COL. BIRCH'S RECEIPT 
for rheumatic gout or acute rheu 
matism. Half an ounce of nitre (sat- 
petre), half an ounce of sulphur, half 
an ounce of flower of mustard, half an 
ounce of Turkey rhubarb, quarter of 
an ounce of powdered gum guiacum. 
Mix. A teaspoonful to be taken every 
other night for three nights, and omit 
three nights, in a wine-glassful of cold 
water, water which has been well 
boiled. 

2174. OINTMENT FOB THE PILES 
or Haemorrhoids. Take of hogs' lard, 
four ounces, camphor two drachms, 
powdered galls, one ounce, laudanum, 
half an ounce. Mix ; make an oint- 
ment to be applied every night at bed- 
time. 

2175. OINTMENT FOR SORE 
NIPPLES. Take of tincture of tolu 
two drachms, spermaceti ointment half 
an ounce ; powdered gum two drachms. 
Mix. Make an ointment. The white 
of an egg mixed with brandy is the 
best application for sore nipples ; the 
person should at the same time use a 
nipple shield. 

2176. OINTMENT FOR BRO- 
KEN CHILBLAINS OR CHAPPEIJ 
HANDS, &., Sweet oil, one pint; 
Venice turpentine, three ounces ; hogs' 
lard, half a pound ; bees' wax, three 
ounces. Put all into a pipkin over a 
slow fire, and stir it with a wooden 
spoon till the bees' wax is all melted, 
and the ingredients simmer. It is fit 
for use as soon as cold, but the longer it 
is kept the better it will be. It must 
be spread very thin on soft rag, or (for 
chaps or cracks) rubbed on the hands 
when you go to bed. A visitor to t, 
large poor district has never know* 
this to fail. 

2177. FOR A COUGH. Syrup of 
poppies, oxymel of squills, simple 



FOR THE LIGHT O* THE DAY WE'VE NOTHING TO PAT. 



369 



oxymel, in equal parts, mixed, and a 
teaspoonful taken when the cough is 
troublesome. It is best to have it 
mixed by a chemist. The cost is trifling. 

2178. BUGS. Spirits of naphtha 
rubbed with a small painter's brush into 
every part of a bedstead is a certain 
way of getting rid of bugs. The mat- 
trass and binding of the bed should be 
examined, and the same process attend- 
ed to, as they generally harbour more 
in these parts than in the bedstead. 
Three pennyworth of naphtha is suffi- 
cient for one bed. 

2179. WASHING. (Suprem acy of 
soap-suds over lime (See 654 and 
3668.) To save your linen and your 
labour. Pour on half a pound of soda 
two quarts of boiling water, in an 
earthenware pan ; take half a pound of 
soap, shred fine ; put it into a saucepan 
with two quarts of cold water ; stand 
it on a fire till it boils ; and when per- 
fectly dissolved and boiling, add it to 
the former. Mix it well, and let it 
stand till cold, when it has the appear- 
ance of a strong jelly. Let your linen 
be soaked in water, the seams and any 
other dirty part rubbed in the usual 
way, and remain till the following 
morning. Get your copper ready and 
add to the water about a pint basin 
full ; when lukewarm put in your linen 
and allow it to boil twenty minutes. 
Rinse it in the usual way, and that is 
all which is necessary to get it clean 
and to keep it in good colour. The 
above receipt is invaluable to house- 
keepers. If you have not tried it, do so 
without delay. 

2180. LEECH BAROMETER. - 
Take an eight ounce phial, and put in it 
three gills of water, and place in it a 
healthy leech, changing the water in 
summer once a week, and in winter 
once in a fortnight, and it will most 
accurately prognosticate the weather. 
If the weather is to be fine, the leech 
lies motionless at the bottom of the 
glass and coiled together in a spiral 
form ; if rain may be expected, it will 
creep up to the top of its lodgings and 
remain thejre till the weather is settled ; 



if we are to have wind, it will move 
through its habitation with amazing 
swiftness, and seldom goes to rest till 
it begins to blow hard ; if a remarkable 
storm of thunder and rain is to suc- 
ceed, it will lodge for some days before 
almost continually out of the water, 
and discover great uneasiness in violent 
throes and convulsive-like motions ; in 
frost as in clear summer-like weather 
it lies constantly at the bottom ; and in 
snow as in rainy weather it pitches its 
dwelling in the very mouth of the 
phial. The top should be covered over 
with a piece of muslin. 

2181. LIFE-BELTS. An excel- 
lent and cheap life belt, for persons pro- 
ceeding to sea, bathing in dangerous 
places, or learning to swim, may be thus 
made : Take a yard and three-quarters 
of strong" jean, double and divide it 
into nine compartments. Let there be 
a space of two inches after each third 
compartment. Fill the compartments 
with very fine cuttings of cork, which 
may be made by cutting up old corks, 
or (still better) purchased at the cork- 
cutters. Work eyelet holes at the bot- 
tom of each compartment to let the 
water drain out. Attach a neck-band 
and waist strings of stout boot- web, 
and sew them on strongly. 

2182. ANOTHER. Cut open an old 
boa, or victorine, and line it with fine 
cork-cuttings instead of wool. For 
ladies going to sea these are excellent, 
as they may be worn in stormy weather, 
without giving appearance of alarm in 
danger. They may be fastened to the 
body by ribands or tapes, of the colour 
of the fur. Gentlemen's waistcoats 
may be lined the same way. 

2183. A CHATTEL MORTGAGE, as it is 

technically called, must be filed in the 
town or city of the mortgager (in this 
city at the register' s). It must be accom- 
panied by an immediate delivery of the 
property, and followed by an actual and 
continued change of possession, other- 
wise it is void as against creditors of the 
mortgagers, subsequent lien-holders, or 
purchasers in good faith. Every con- 
tract for the leasing for a longer period

contract, or some note or memoran- 
dum thereof, expressing the considera- 
tion, ho in writing, and be subscribed 
by the party who makes the lease, or 
by the agent of such party lawfully 
authorized. 

2184. PEAS POWDER. Pound in 
a marble mortar half an ounce each of 
dried mint and sage, a drachm of celery 
seed, and a quarter of a drachm of 



cayenne pepper ; rub them together door of knowledge may be opened. 



through a fine sieve. This gives a very 
savoury relish to peas soup and to 
gruel, which, by its help, if the eater of 
it has not the most lively imagination, 
he may fancy he is sipping good peas 
soup. A drachm of allspice, or black 
pepper, may be pounded with the above 
as an addition, or instead of the cayenne. 

2185. HORSERADISH POWDER. 
The time to make this is during Novem- 
ber and December ; slice it the thickness 
of a shilling, and lay it to dry very grad- 
ually in a Dutch oven (a strong heat 
soon evaporates its flavour) ; when 
dry enough, pound it and bottle it.

This will comprise such hints and 
advice as will enable any one to act on 
an emergency, or in ordinary trivial 
accidents requiring simple treatment ; 



distinguish between serious 
simple accidents, and the best 



and

means to adopt in all cases that are 
likely to fall under a person's notice. 
These hints will be of the utmost value 
to the heads of families, to emigrants, 
and to persons who are frequently 
called upon to attend upon the sick. 
We strongly recommend the Parent, 
Emigrant or Nurse, to read over these 
directions occasionally, to regard it as a 
duty to do so at least three or four times 
a year, so as to be prepared for emer- 
gencies whenever they may arise. 
When accidents occur, people are too 
excited to acquire immediately a knowl- 
edge of what they should do ; and 
many lives have been lost for want of 
this knowledge. Study, therefore, at 
moderate intervals the Domestic Sur-

2187. 1. DRESSINGS. Dressings are 
substances usually applied to parts for 
the purpose of soothing, promoting 
their reunion when divided, protecting 
them from external injuries, as a means 
of applying various medicines, to absorb 
discharges, protect the surrounding 
parts and securing cleanliness. 

2188. Certain instruments are re- 
quired for the application of dressings 
in domestic surgery, viz. Scissors, a 
pair of tweezers, or simple forceps, a 
knife, needles and thread, a razor, a 
lancet, a piece of lunar caustic in a 
quill, and a sponge. 

2189. The materials required for 
dressings, consist of lint, scraped linen, 
carded cotton, tow, ointment spread on 
calico, adhesive plaster, compresses, 
pads, poultices, old rags of linen or 
calico, and water. 

2190. The following rules should bo 
attended to in applying dressings : 1 . 
Always prepare the new dressings 
before removing the old one. 2. Al- 
ways have hot and cold water at hand, 
and a vessel to place the foul dressings 
in. 3. Have one or more persona 
at hand ready to assist, and tell each 
person what they are to do before you 
commence, it prevents confusion ; thus 
one is to wash out and hand the 
sponges, another to heat the adhesive 
plaster, or hand the bandages and 
dressings, and, if requisite, a third to 
support the limb, &c. 4. Always stand 
on the outside of a limb to dress it. 

5. Place the patient in as easy a posi- 
tion, as possible, so as not to fatigue him. 

6. Arrange the bed after changing the 
dressings, but in some cases you wilJ 



WHO NEVER TRIES CANNOT WIN THE PRIZE. 



271 



have to do so before the patient is 
placed on it. 7. Never be in a hurry 
when applying dressings, do it quietly. 
8. When a patient requires moving 
from one bed to another, the best way 
is for one person to stand on each side 
of the patient, and each to place an 
arm behind his back, whilr- he passes 
his arms over their necks; th^nlet their 
other arms be passed under his thighs, 
and by holding each other's hands, the 
patient can be raised with ease, and 
removed to another bed. If the leg is 
injured a third person should steady 
it, and if the arm, the same precaution 
should be adopted. Sometimes a stout 
sheet is passed under the patient, and 
by several people holding the sides, the 
patient is lifted without any fatigue or 
much disturbance. 

2191. Lint may be made in a hurry, 
by nailing the corners- of a piece of old 
linen to a board, and scraping its sur- 
face with a knife. It is used either alone 
or spread with ointment. Scraped 
lint is the fine filaments from ordinary 
lint, and is used to stimulate ulcers 
and absorb discharges ; it is what the 
French call Charpie. 

2192. Scraped Lint is made into 
various shapes, for particular purposes. 
For example, when it is screwed up 
into a conical or wedge-like shape, it is 
called a tent, and is used to dilate fis- 
tulous openings, so as to allow the 
matter to escape freely, to plug wounds, 
BO as to promote the formation of a 
clot of blood, and thus arrest bleeding. 
When it is rolled into little balls they 
are called boulettes, and are used for 
absorbing matter in cavities, or blood 
in wounds. Another useful form is 
made by rolling a mass of scraped lint 
into a long roll, and then tying it in 
the middle with a piece of thread ; the 
middle is then doubled and pushed 
into a deep-seated wound so as to press 
upon the bleeding vessel, while the 
ends remain loose and assist in forming 
a clot, or it is used in deep-seated 
ulcers to absorb the matter and keep 
the edges apart. This form is called 
fehe bourdonna Another form is 



called the pelote, which is merely a 
ball of scaped lint tied up in a piece of 
linen rag, commonly called a dabber. 
This is used in the treatment of pro- 
trusion of the navel in Children. 

2193. Carded Cotton is used as a 
dressing for superficial burns, an 
care should be taken to free it fron 
specks, as flies are apt to lay their egg 
there, and generate maggots. 

2194. Tow is chiefly employed as 
padding for splints, as compresses, an 
also as an outer dressing where ther 
is much discharge from a surface. 

2195. Ointments are spread on cal- 
icoes, lint, or even thin layers of tovr 
by means of a knife ; they should not 
be spread too thick. 

2196. Adhesive Plaster is cut into 
strips, ranging in width according to 
the nature of the wound, &c., but the 
usual width is about three-quarters 
of an inch. Isinglass plaster is not so 
irritating as diachylon, and is more 
easily removed. 

2197. Compresses are made of pieces 
of linen, calico, lint, or tow, doubled 
or cut into various shapes. They are 
used to confine dressings in their places, 
and to apply an equal pressure on parts. 
They should be free from darns, hems, 
and knots. Ordinary compresses are 
square, oblong, and triangular The 
pierced compress, is made by folding up 
a square piece of linen five or six times 
on itself, and then nicking the surface 
with scissors, so as to cut out small 
pieces. It is then opened out, and 
spread with ointment. It is applied to 
discharging- surfaces, for the purpose of 
allowing the matter to pass freely 
through the holes, and is frequently 
covered with a thin layer of tow. Com- 
presses are also made in the shape of a 
Maltese cross, and half a cross, some- 
times split singly, and at other times 
doubly : or they are graduated by 
placing square pieces of folded cloth on 
one another, so arranged that they de 
crease in size each time. They are 
used for keeping up pressure upon cer- 
tain parts. 

2198. Pads are made by sewing tovi 



A HUSBAND'S WRATH SPOILS THE BEST BROTH. 



inside pieces of linen, or folding linen 
auvl sew.ng the pieces together. They 
are used to keep off pressure from parts, 
such t.ti that caused by splint in frac- 
tures. 

2199 Poult. ccs are usually made of 
linseed-xneal, oatmeal, or bread, either 
combined with water and other fluids ; 
iometime/s they are made of carrots, 
charcoal, potatoes, yeast, and linseed- 
meal, mustard, &c. (See 3313.) 

2200. BANDAGES. Bandages are strips 
of calico, linen, flannel, muslin, elastic- 
webbing, bunting, or some other sub- 
stance of various lengths, sucli as three, 
four, eight, ten, or twelve yards, and 
one, one an<2 a-half, two, two and a.-half, 
three, four, or six inches wide, free from 
hems or darns ; soft and unglazed. 
They are better after they have been 
washed. Their uses are to retain dress- 
ings, apparatus, or parts of the body 
in their proper positions, support the 
soft parts, and maintain equal pressure. 

2201. Bandages are simple and com- 
pound ; the former are simple slips 
rolled up tightly like a roll of ribbon. 
There is also another simple kind which 
is rolled from both ends, this is called 
a double-headed bandage. The com- 
pound bandages are formed of many 
pieces. 

2202. Bandages for the head should 
be two inches wide and five yards long ; 
for the neck two inches wide and three 
yards long ; for the arm, two inches 
wide and seven yards long ; for the leg, 
two inches and a-half wide and seven 
yards long : for the thigh, three inches 
wide and eight yards long ; and for the 
body, four or six inches wide and ten 
or twelve yards long. 

2203. To apply a single-headed band- 
age, lay the outside of the end next to 
the part to be bandaged, and to hold 
the roll between the little, ring, and 
middle fingers, nd the palm of the 
left hand, using the thumb and fore fin- 
ger of the same hand to guide it, and 
the right hand to keep it firm, and pass 
the bandage partly round the leg to- 
wards th 3 left hand. It is sometimes 
necessary to reverse this order, and 



therefore it is well to be able to use 
both hands. Particular parts require a 
different method of applying bandages, 
and therefore we shall describe the most 
useful separately, and there are different 
ways of putting on the same bandage, 
which consists in the manner the folds 
or turns are made. For example, the 
circular bandage is formed by horizontal 
turns, each of which over-laps the one 
made before it ; the spiral consists of 
spiral turns ; the oblique follows a course 
oblique or slanting to the centre of the 
limb ; and the recurrent folds back again 
to the part whence it started. 

2204. Circular bandages are used for 
the neck, to retain dressings on any part 
of it, or for blisters, setons, &c. ; for the 
head, to keep dressings on the forehead 
or any part contained within a circle 
passing round the head ; for the arm, 
previous to bleeding ; for the leg, above 
the knee; and for the fingers, &c. 

2205. To confine the ends of bandages, 
some persons use pins, others slit the 
end for a short distance, and tie the two 
strips into a knot, and some use a strip 
of adhesive plaster. Always place the 
point of a pin in such a position that it 
should not be likely to prick the patient, 
or the person dressing the limb, or be 
likely to draw out by using the limb : 
therefore, as a general rule, turn the 
head of the pin from the free end of the 
bandage, or towards the upper part of 
the limb. 

2206. The oblique bandage is gene- 
rally used for arms and legs to retain 
dressings. 

2207. The spiral bandage is generally 
applied to the trunk and extremities, 
but it is apt to fall off even when very 
carefully applied; therefore we gene- 
rally use another called the recurrent, 
which folds back again. 

2208. The recurrent bandage is the 
best kind of bandage that we can em- 
ploy for general purposes. The method 
of putting it on is as follows : Apply 
the end of the bandage that is free, with 
the outside of it next the skin, and hold 
this end with the finger and thumb oi 
the left hand, while some one support* 



MIND THAT YOUR 8EEDS ARE NOT OF WEEDS. 



273 



the heel of the patient ; then with the 
right liand to pass the bandage over the 
piece you are holding, and keep it 
crossed thus, until you can place your 
right forefinger upon the spot where it 
crosses the other bandage, where it 
must be kept firm. Now hold the roll 
of the bandage in your left hand, with 
the palm looking upwards, and taking 
care to keep that part of the bandage be- 
tween your right fore-finger, and the roll 
in your left hand quite slack; turn your 
left hand over, and bi'ing the bandage 
down upon the leg ; then pass the roll 
under the leg towards your right hand, 
and repeat this until the leg is bandaged 
up to the knee, taking- care not to drag 
the bandage at any time during the 
process of bandaging. When you arrive 
at the knee, pass the bandage round the 
leg in circles just below the knee, and 
pin it as usual. Bandaging is very easy, 
and if you once see any one apply a 
bandage properly, and attend to these 
rules, there will not be any difficulty ; 
but bear one thing in mind, with- 
out which you will never put on a 
bandage even decently ; and that is, 
never to drag or pull at a bandage, but 
make the turns while it is slack, and 
you have your right forefinger placed 
upon the point where it is to be folded 
down. When a limb is properly 
bandaged, the folds should run in a line 
corresponding to the shin-bone. Use, 
to retain dressings, and for varicose 
veins. 

2209. A bandage for the chest is 
always placed upon the patient in a 
Bitting posture ; and it may be put on 
in circles or spirally. Use, in fractures 
of the ribs, to retain dressings, and 
after BeVere contusions. 

2210. A bandage for the belly is placed 
on the patient as directed in the last, if 
spiral!) carrying it from above down- 
wards. Use, to compress the belly after 
dropsy, or retain dressings. 

221 1 . The hand is bandaged by cross- 
ing the bandage over the back of the 
hand. Use, to retain dressings. 

2212. tor the head, a bandage may 
be c'.if v Ur. or spiral, <ir both ; in the 



latter case, commence by placing one 
circular turn just over the ears ; then 
! bring down from left to right, and 
round the head again so as to alternate 
a spiral with a circular turn. Use, 
to retain dressings on the head or over 
the eye ; but this form soon gets slack. 
The circular bandage is the best, cross- 
ing it over both eyes. 

2213. For the Foot. Place the end 
just above the outer ankle, and make 
two circular turns, to prevent its slip- 
ping ; then bring it down from the in- 
side of the foot over the instep towards 
the outer part ; pass it under the sole of 
the foot, and upwards and inwards over 
the instep towards the inner ankle, then 
rc*nd the ankle, and repeat again. 
Use, to retain dressings to the instep, 
heel, or ankle. 

2214. For the leg and foot, commence 
and proceed as directed in 2213 ; then 
continue it up the leg as ordered in 
2208. 

2215. As it sometimes happens that 
it is necessary to apply a bandage at 
once, and the materials are not at hand, 
it is desirable to know how to substitute 
something else that any one may apply 
with ease. This is found to be effected 
by handkerchiefs, and an experienced 
surgeon has paid great attention to 
this subject, and brought it to much 
perfection. It is to him, therefore, that 
we are indebted for most of these hints. 

2216. Any ordinary handkerchief 
will do ; but a square of linen folded 
into various shapes answers better. 
The shapes generally required are as 
follows : The triangle, the long square, 
the cravat and the cord. 

2217. The triangular handkerchief is 
made by folding it from corner to cor- 
ner. Use, as a bandage for the head. 
Application. Place the base round the 
head, and the short part hanging down 
behind, then tie the long ends over it. 

2218. The loner-square is made by 
folding the handkerchief into three 
parts, or double it once upon itself. 
Use, as a bandage to the ribs, belly, &c. 
If one handkerchief is n'/t long enough, 
sew two together. 



274 



WANT OF VARIETY LEADS TO SATIETY. 



2219. The cravat is folded as usual 
with cravats. USB, as a bandage for the 
head, arms, legs, feet, neck, &c. 

'2220. The cord is used to compress 
vessels, when a knot is made in it, and 
placed over the vessel to be com- 
pressed. It is merely a handkerchief 
twisted in its long diameter. 

2221. Sometimes it is necessary to 
apply two or more handkerchiefs, as in 
a broken collar-bone, or when it is 
necessary to keep dressings under the 
arm. It is applied by knotting the two 
ends of one handkerchief together, and 
passing the left arm through it, then 
passing another handkerchief under the 
right arm, and tying it. By this means 
we can brace the shoulders well bak, 
and the handkerchief will press firmly 
over the broken collar-bone ; besides, 
thit form of bandage does not readily 
slip or get slack, but it requires to be 
combined with the sling, in order to 
keep the arm steady. 

2222. When a woman has an inflamed 
breast that requires support or dress- 
ings to be kept to it, tie two ends of 
the handkerchief round her neck, and 
bring the body of it over the breast, 
and pass it upwards and backwards 
under the arm of that side, and tie the 
ends of those around the neck. 

An excellent sling is formed by 
placing one handkerchief around the 
neck, and knotting the two ends over 
the breast-bone, then placing the other 
in triangle under the arm, to be sup- 
ported with the base near to the hand ; 
tie the ends over the handkerchief, and 
pin the top to the other part after pass- 
ing it aroun.d the elbow. 

2223. APPARATUS. When a person 
receives a severe contusion of the leg 
or foot, or breaks his leg, or has pain- 
ful ulcers over the leg, or is unable 
from some cause to bear the pressure 
of the bedclothes, it is advisable to 
know how to keep them from hurting 
the leg. .This may be done by bending 
up a fire-guard, or placing a chair, 
resting upon the edge of its back and 
front of the seat over the leg, or putting 
a box on each aide of it. and placing a 



plank over them ; but the best way ia 
to make a cradle, as it is called. This 
is done by getting three pieces of wood, 
and three pieces of iron wire, and 
passing the wire or hoop through the 
wood. This can be placed to any 
height, and is very useful in all cases 
where pressure cannot be borne. Wood- 
en hoops cut in halves answer better 
than the wire. 

2224. When a person breaks his leg, 
and splints cannot be had directly, get 
a bunch of straw or twigs, and roll it 
up in a handkerchief, and place one on 
each side of the leg or arm, and bind 
another handkerchief firmly around 
them, or make a long bag about three 
inches in diameter, or even more, of 
coarse linen duck, or carpet, and stuff 
this full of bran, sawdust or sand, sew 
up the end, and use this the same a? 
the twigs. It forms an excellent ex- 
temporaneous splint. Another good 
plan is to get a hat-box made of chip, 
and cut it into suitable lengths, or for 
want of all these, some bones out of a 
pair of stays, and run them through a 
stout piece of rug, protecting the leg 
with a fold of rug, linen, &c. 

2225. When dry warmth is required 
to be applied to any part of the body, 
fry a flour pancake and lay it over the 
part ; or warm some sand and place in 
the patient's socks, and lay it to the 
part ; salt does as well, and may be put 
into a paper bag ; or warm water put 
into ginger-beer bottles or stone jars, 
and rolled up in flannel. 

2226. IV. MINOR OPERATIONS. 
Bleeding is sometimes necessary at 
once in certain accidents, such as con- 
cussion, and therefore it is well to know 
how to do this. First of all, bind up 
the arm above the elbow with a pieco 
of bandage or a handkerchief, pretty 
firmly, then place your finger over the 
veins at the bend of the arm, and feel 
if there is any pulsation ; if there is, try 
another vein, and if it does not pulsato 
or beat, choose that one- Now rub 
the ana, from the wrist towards the 
elbow, place the left thumb upon tho 
vein, und hold the lancet as you wou!4

i pen, and nearly at right angles to the 
vein, taking care to prevent its going in 
too far, by keeping the thumb near to 
the point, and resting the hand upon 
the little linger. Now place the point 
of the lancet on the vein ; push it sud- 
denly inwards, depress the elbow, and 
raise the hand upwards and outwards 
so as to cut obliquely across the vein. 
When sufficient blood is drawn off, 
which is known by feeling the pulse at 
the wrist, and near the thumb, bandage 
the arm. If the pulse feel like apiece 
of cord, more blood should be taken 
away, but if it is soft, and can be easily 
pressed, the bleeding should be stopped. 
When you bandage the arm, place a 
piece of lint over the opening made by 
the lancet, and pass a bandage lightly, 
but firmly, around the arm, so as to 
cross it over the bend of the elbow. 

2227. Dry Cupping is performed by 
throwing a piece of paper dipped into 
spirit of wine, and ignited into a wine- 
glass, and placing it over the part, such 
as the neck, temples, &c. It thus draws 
the flesh into the glass, and causes a 
termination of blood to the part, which 
is useful in headache, or many other 
complaints. This is an excellent method 
of extracting the poison from wounds 
made by adders, mad dogs, fish, &c. 

2228. Ordinary Cupping is performed 
the same as dry cupping, with this ex- 
ception, that the part is scarified or 
scratched with a lancet, so as to cause 
the blood to flow. Then the glass 
is placed over it again with the lighted 
paper in it, and when sufficient blood 
has been taken away, then the parts 
are sponged, and a piece of sticking- 
plaster applied over them. 

2229. LEECHES AND THEIR AP- 
PLICATION. The leech used for 
medical purposes is called the hirudo 
Mcdicinalis, to distinguish it from other 
varieties, such as the horse-leech and 
the Lisbon leech. It varies from two 
to four inches in length, and is of ft 
blackish brown colour, marked on the 
back with six yellow spots, and edged 
v.-ith a yellow line on each side For- 
merly leeches were supplied 

12* 



but latterly most of the leeches are pro- 
cured from France, where they are 
now becoming scarce. 

2230. When leeches are applied to a 
part, it should be thoroughly freed from 
down or hair by shaving, and all lini- 
ments, &c., carefully and effectually 
cleaned away by washing. If the 
leech is hungry it will soon bite, but 
sometimes great difficulty is experi- 
enced in getting them to fasten on. 
When this is the case, roll the leech 
into a little porter, or moisten the sur- 
face with a little blood, or milk, or 
sugar and water. Leeches may be 
applied by holding them over the part 
with a piece of linen cloth or by means 
of an inverted glass, under which they 
must be placed. 

2231. When applied to the gums, caro 
should be taken to use a leech glass, aa 
they are apt to creep down the patient's 
throat; a large swan's quill will answer 
the purpose of a leech glass. When 
leeches are gorged they will drop off 
themselves; never tear them off from 
a person, but just dip the point of a 
moistened finger into some salt and 
touch them with it. 

2232. Leeches are supposed to ab- 
stract about two drachms of blood, or 
six leeches draw about an ounce ; but 
this is independent of the bleeding 
after they have come off, and more 
blood generally flows then than during 
the time they are sucking. 

2233. After leeches come away, en- 
courage the bleeding by flannels dipped 
in hot water and wrung out dry, and 
then apply a warm " spongio-piline " 
poultice. If the bleeding is not to be 
encouraged, cover the bites with rag 
dipped in olive oil, or spread with 
spen aceti ointment, having previously 
sponged the parts clean. 

2234. When bleeding continues from 
leech bites, and it is desirable to stop 
it, apply pressure with the fingers over 
the part, or dip a rag in a stroug- solu- 

j tion of alum and lay over them, or use 
the tincture of seequichloride of iron, 
or apply a leaf of matico to them, 
placing the tinder surface of th W

next to the skin, )r touch each bite 
with a finely-pointed piece of lunar 
caustic ; and if all these tried in succes- 
sion fail, pass a fine needle through a 
fold of the skin so as to include the 
bite, and twist a piece of thread round 
it. Be sure never to allow any one t" 
go to sleep with leech bites bleedinj . , 
without watching them carefully ; and 
never apply too many to children. 

2235. After leeches have been used 
they should be placed in water, contain- 
ing sixteen per cent, of salt, which 
facilitates the removal of the blood 
they contain ; and they should After- 
wards be placed one by one in v < v m 
water, and the blood forced out by 
gentle pressure. The leeches should 
then be thrown into fresh water, which 
is to be renewed every twenty-four 
hours; and they may then be re-ap- 
plied after an interval of eight or ten 
aays ; a second time they may be dis- 
gorged. 

2236. If a leech is accidentally swal- 
lowed, or by any means gets into the 
body, employ an emetic, or enema of 
salt and water. 

2237. Scarification is useful in severe 
contusions, and inflammation of parts. 
It is performed by scratching or slightly 
cutting through the skin with a lancet, 
holding the lancet as you w r ould a pen 
when you are ruling lines on paper. 

2238. ACCIDENTS. Always send off 
for a surgeon immediately an acci- 
dent occurs, but treat as directed until he 
arrives. Burns. If the skin is much 
injured, spread some linen pretty thickly 
with chalk ointment (979), and lay over 
the part, and give the patient some 
brandy and water if much exhausted ; 
then send for a medical man. If not 
much injured and very painful, use the 
same ointment or apply carded cotton 
dipped in lime-water and linseed oil 
(938). If you please, you may lay 
cloths dipped in aether over the parts, 
or cold lotions (909,970). 

2-239. Scalds. Trent the same as 
burns, or cover with ecraped raw 
potato ; but th > chalk ointment is the 
best. In the absface af all these, 



cover the parts with treacle, and dust 
on plenty of flour. 

2240. Body in Flames. Lay the 
person down on the floor <>f the room, 
and throw the tablecloth, rug, or other 
large cloth over him, and roll him on 
the floor. 

2241. Dirt in the Eye. Place your 
forefinger upon the cheekbone, having 
the patient before you ; then draw up 
the finger and you will probably be 
abte to remove the dirt ; but if this will 
not enable you to get at it, repeat this 
operation while you have a netting- 
needle or bodkin placed over the eyelid ; 
this will turn it inside out, and enable 
you to remove the sand, or eyelash, &c., 
with the corner of a fine silk handker- 
chief. As soon as the substance is re- 
moved, bathe the eye with cold water 
and exclude the light for a day. If the 
inflammation is severe, take a purga- 
tive and use a refrigerant lotion (969). 

2242. Lime in the Eye. Syringe it 
well with warm vinegar and water (one 
ounce to eight ounces of water) ; take 
a purgative, and exclude light. 

2243. Iron or Steel Spiwlcr in the Eye 
This occurs while turning iron or 
steel in a lathe. Drop a solution of 
sulphate of copper (from one to three 
grains of the salt to one ounce of water) 
iiifto the eye, or keep the eye open 
in a wine-glassful of the solution. Take 
a purgative, bathe wiih cold lotion, and 
exclude light to keep down inflamma- 
tion. 

2244. Dislocated Thumb. This is 
frequently produced by a fall. Make 
a clove hitch, by passing tw r o loops of 
cord over the thumb, placing a piece 
of rag under the cord to prevent it 
cutting the thumb; then pull in the 
eauie line as the thumb. Afterwards 
apply a cold lotion (970). 

2245. Cuts and Wounds. Cut thin 
strips of sticking-plaster, and bring the 
parts together: or if large and deep, 
cut two broad pieces so as to look like 
the teeth of a comb, and place one on 
each side of the wound, which must be 
cleaned previously. These pieces must 

I be arrariged so that they eball interlaca

one another ; then by laying hold of 
the pieces on the right hand side with 
one hand, and those on the other Bide 
with the other hand, and pulling 1 them 
froin one another, the edges of the 
wound are brought together, and with- 
out any difficulty. 

2246. Ordinary Cuts are dressed by 
thin strips applied by pressing down 
the plaster on one side of the wound, 
and keeping it there and pulling in the 
opposite direction ; then suddenly de- 
pressing the hand when the edges of 
the wound are brought together. 

2247. Contusions. When they are 
vr-ry severe, lay a cloth over the part, 
and suspend a basin over it filled with 
cold lotion. (969, 970.) Put a piece 
of cotton into the basin, so that it shall 
allow the lotion to drop on the cloth, 
and thus keep it always wet. 

2248. Haemorrhage, when caused by 
an artery being divided or torn, may 
be known by the blood jumping out of 
the wound, and being of a bright scar- 
let colour. If a vein is injured, the 
blood is darker, and flows continuously. 
To stop the latter, apply pressure by 
means of a compress and bandage. To 
arrest arterial bleeding get a piece 
of wood (part of a mop-handle will 
do), and tie a piece of tape to one 
end of it; then tie a piece of tape 
loosely over the arm, and pass the 
other end of the wood under it ; twist 
the stick round and round until the 
tape compresses the arm sufficiently to 
nrrest the bleeding, and then confine 
the other end by tying the string round 
the arm. If the bleeding is very 
obstinate, and it occurs in the arm, 
place a cork underneath the string, on 
the inside of the fleshy part, where the 
artery may be felt beating by any 
one ; if in the leg, place a cork in the 
direction of a line drawn from the 
inner part of the knee a little to the 
outside of the groin. It is an excellent 
thing to accustom yourself to find out 
the position of these arteries, or indeed 
any that are superficial, and to explain 
to every one in your house where they 
are. and how to stop blt<ttiig. If a 



stick cannot be got, take a handker- 
chief make -a cord bandage of it, and 
tie a knot in the naddle ; the knot acts 
as a compress, and should be placed 
over the artery, while the two ends are 
to be tied around the thumb. Observe 
always to place the ligature between the 
wound and the heart. Putting your 
finger into a bleeding wound, and 
making pressure until a surgeon 
arrives, will generally stop violent 
bleeding. 

2249. Bleeding from the Nose, from 
whatever cause, may generally be 
stopped by putting a plug of lint into 
the nostrils ; if this does not do, apply 
a cold lotion to the forehead (969,970); 
raise the head, and place both arms 
over the head, so that it will rest on 
both hands ; dip the lint plug, slightly 
moistened, into some powdered gum 
arabic, and plug the nostrils again ; or 
dip the plug- into equal parts of pow- 
dered gum arabic and alum, and plug 
the nose. If the bowels are confined, 
take a purgative. 

2250. Violent shocks will sometimes 
stun a person, and he will remain un- 
conscious. Untie strings, collars, &c. ; 
loose anything that is tight, arid inter- 
feres with the breathing ; raise the 
head ; see if there is bleeding from any 
part ; apply smelling-salts to the nose, 
and hot bottles to the feet. 

2251. In Concussion, the surface of 
the body is cold and pale, and the 
pulse weak and small, the breathing 
slow and gentle, and the pupil of the 
eye generally contracted or small. You 
can get a answer by speaking loud 
so as to arouse the patient. Give a 
little brandy and water, keep the 
place quiet, apply warmth, and do not 
raise the head too high. If you tickle 
the feet, the patient feels it. 

2252. In Compression of the Brain t 
from any cause, such as apoplexy, or a 
piece of fractured bone pressing on 
it, there is loss of sensation. If you 
tickle the feet, he does not feel iv 
You cannot arouse him so as to get an 
answer. The pulse is slow, and labored; 
the breathing slow, labored, and snore-

ing ; the pupils enlarged. Raise the 
head, unloose strings or tight tilings, 
and send for a surgeon. If one cannot 
Ue got at once, apply mustard -poultices 
to the feet, and leeches to the temples. 

2253. Choking. When a person has 
a fish bone in the throat, insert the 
forefinger, press upon the root of the 
tongue, so as to induce vomiting ; if this 
does not do, let them swallow a large 
piece of potato or soft bread ; and if 
these fail, give a mustard emetic. 

2254. Fainting, Hysterics, &c. 
Loosen the garments, bathe the tem- 
ples with water or eau de Cologne : 
fresh air; avoid bustle, and excessive 
sympathy. 

2255. Drowning. Attend to the fol- 
lowing essential rules : 1. Lose no 
time. 2. Handle the body gently. 3. 
Carry the body with the head gently 
raised, and never hold it up by the 
feet. 4. Send for medical assistance 
immediately, and in the meantime act 
as follows: 1. Strip the body, rub it 
dry : then rub it in hot blankets, and 
place it in a warm bed in a warm room. 
2. Cleanse away the froth and mucus 
from the nose and mouth. 3. Apply 
warm bricks, bottles, bags of sand, &c. 
to the arm-pits, between the thighs and 
soles of the feet. 4. Rub the surface 
of the body with the hands enclosed in 
warm dry worsted socks. 5. If pos- 
sible, put the body into a warm bath. 
6. To restore breathing, put the pipe of 
a common bellows 'nto one nostril, 
carefully closing the other and the 
mouth ; at the same time drawing 
downwards, and pushing gently back- 
wards the 'upper part of the windpipe, 
to allow a more free admission of air ; 
blew the bellows gently, in order to 
inflate the lungs, till the breast be rais- 
ed a little ; then set the mouth and nost- 
rils free, and press gently on the chest ; 
repeat this until signs of life appear. 
When the patient revives apply smell- 
ing-salts to the nose, give warm wine 
or brandy and water. Cautions, 1. 
Never rub the body with salt or spirits. 
2. Never roll the body en casks. 3. 
Continue the remedies for twelve hours 
without erasing 



2256. Hanging. Loose the cord, of 
whatever suspended the person, and 
proceed as for drowning, taking the 
additional precaution to apply eight or 
ten leeches to the temples. 

2257. Apparent Death from Drunken- 
ness. Raise the head, unloose the 
clothes, maintain warmth of surface 
and give a mustard emetic as soon a 
the person can swallow. 

2258. Apoplexy and Fits generally. ~ 
Raise the head; unloose all tight 
clothes, string, &c. ; apply cold lotions 
(969,970) to the head, which should 
be shaved ; apply leeches to the temples, 
and send for a surgeon. 

2259. Suffocation from noxious gases, 
&c. Remove to the fresh air : dash cold 
vinegar and water in the face, neck and 
breast , keep up the warmth of the 
body ; if necessary apply mustard 
poultices to the soles of the feet, and 
try artificial respirations as in drown- 
ing-. 

2260. Lightning and Sun-stroke. 
Treat the same as apoplexy. 

2261. POISONS, GENERAL OB 
SERVATIONS. The abbreviation 
used are as follows : E. effects orsymv 
toms. T. treatment. A. antidotes 01 
counter-poisons. D. A. dangerous an 
tidotes. 

A poison is a substance which is 
capable of altering, or destroying, some 
or all of the functions necessary to life. 

When a person is in good health and 
is suddenly attacked, after having taken 
some food or drink, with violent pain 
cramp in the stomach, sense of sickness 
or nausea, vomiting, convulsive twitch- 
ings, and a sense of suffocation ; or if 
he be seized, under the same circum- 
stances, with giddiness, delirium, or 
unusual sleepiness, then poisoning may 
be supposed. 

2262. Poisons have been divided into 
four classes : 1st. Those causing- local 
symptoms. 2nd. Those producing 

pasmodic symptoms. 3rd.. Narcotic 
or sleepy symptoms ; and 4th. Paraly- 
tic symptoms. 

2263. Poisons may be mineral, animal, 
or vegetable, 

2264. 1st. Always send immediately

for a medical man ; 2nd. Save all fluids 
vomited, and articles of food, cups, 
glasses, &c., used by ti.e patient before 
being taken ill, and lock them up ; 3rd. 
Examine the cups, to guide you in your 
treatment ; that is, smell them, and look 
at them. 

2265. As a rule, give emetics after 
poisons that cause sleepiness and raving; 
chalk, milk, eggs, butter, and warm 
water, or oil, after poisons that cause 
vomiting and pain in the stomach and 
bowels, with purging ; and when there 
is no inflammation about the throat, 
tickle it with a feather to excite vomit- 
ing.

voice hoarse, speaking painful ; skin 
cold and clammy. Sometimes there 
are cramps and convulsions, followed 
by death. T. Give plenty of warm 
water, new milk in large quantities, 
gruel, linseed tea, apply leeches to the 
bowels, foment, and give starch or 
gruel enemas. Scrape the iron rust olF 
anything you can get at, mix it with 

Slenty of water, and give in large 
raughts frequently, and give an emetic 
of sulphate of zinc (white vitriol.) 
Caution. Never give large draughts of 
fluid until those given before have been 
vomited, because the stomach will not 
contract properly if filled with fluid, 
and the object is to get rid of the poi- 
son as speedily as possible. 

2267. COPPER (Blue vitriol, or blue 
stone ; ccrdigrisi ; vcrditcr ; - verdigrisi 
crystals) E. An acid, rough, disagree-

above (2267) ; milk ; flour and water, 
mixed pretty thick ; linseed tea ; and 
barley-water. T. Give large draughts

sea-lobster ; mussel ; tunny ; blower ; 
rock-Jish, &c. E. Intense pain in the 
Btomach after swallowing- the fish, vo- 
miting, purging, and sometimes cramps. 
T. Give an emetic, excite vomiting 
by tickling the throat, and plenty of 
warm water. Follow emetics by active 
purgatives, abate inflammation by the 
usual remedies, and drink freely of 
eugar and water. 

2286. BITES OF REPTILES. Vipa* : 
Hack viper ; Indian serpents ; rattle- 
snake. E. Violent aud quick inflamma- 
tion of the part, extending towards the 
body, soon becoming livid ; na-vw^a, 
vomiting, convulsions, difficult breath- 
Ing, mortification, cold sweats, and 
t?eath. 'T Suppose A hat the wrist has 



been bitten, immediately tie a tape 
between the wound and the heart. 
scarify the parts with a penknife, razor, 
or lancet, and apply a cupping-glasa 
over the bite, frequently removing it 
and bathing the wound with volatile 
alkali, or heat a poker and burn ^hfe 
wound well, or drop some of Sir Win. 
Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid into the 
wound. Give plenty of warm drinks, 
and cover up in bed. 

2287. MAD ANIMALS, BITE OF. E. 
Hydrophobia, or a fear of fluids. T. 
Tie a string tightly over the part, cut 
out the bite, and cauterize the wound 
with a red-hot poker, lunar caustic, or 
Sir Wm. Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid. 
Then apply a piece of "spongio-piline,'' 
give a purgative, and plenty of warm 
drink. Whenever chloroform can be 
procured, sprinkle a few drops upon a 
handkerchief and apply to the nose and 
mouth of the patient before cauterizing 
tha wound. When the breathing ap- 
pears difficult, cease the application of 
the chloroform. A physician, writing 
in the Times, strongly urges this course, 
and states that there is no danger, with 
ordinary care, in the application ot 
the chloroform, while the cauterization 
may be more effectively performed. 

2288. INSECT STINGS. Wasp, bee, 

fnat, hornet, gad-fly, scorpion. E. 
welling, nausea, and fever. T. Press 
the barrel of a watch-key over the part, 
so as to expose the sting, which 
must be removed. Lay a rag moistened 
with hartshorn and oil over the part. 
Give six or eight drops of hartshorn in 
two ounces of infusion of chamomile, 
and cover up in bed. 

2289. OYSTER CATSUP. Take 
fine fresh oysters ; wash them in their 
own liquor, skim it, pound them in a 
marble mortar, to a pint of oysters add 
a pint of sherry, boil them up, and ad<^ 
an ounce of salt, two drachms of pound- 
ed mace, and one of cayenne. let it 
just boil up again, skim it, aud rub it 
through a sieve ; and when cold bottle 
it, then cork it well, and seal it down. 

2290. OX-CHEEK STEWED. Pre- 
pare the day before it is to be eaten ; cloaw

the cheek and put it into soft water, just 
warm ; let it lie three or four hours, 
then put it into cold water, and let it 
soak all night ; next day wipe it clean, 
put it into a stew-pan, and just cover it 
with water; skim it well when it is 
coming to a boil, then put two whole 
onions, stick two or three cloves into 
each, three turnips, quartered, a couple 
of carrots sliced, two bay-leaves, and 
twenty-four corns of allspice, a head of 
celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, 
pepper, and salt; add cayenne and gar- 
lic, in such proportions as the palate 
that requires them may desire. Let it 
stew gently till perfectly tender, about 
three hours ; then take out the cheek, 
divide it into pieces, fit to help at table ; 
skim, and strain the gravy ; melt an 
ounce and a half of butter in a stew 
pan ; stir into it as much flour as it will 
take up ; mix with it by degrees a pint 
arid a half of the gravy : add to it a 
table-spoonful of mushroom or walnut 
catsup, or port wine, and give it a 
boil. Serve up in a soup or ragout-dish, 
or make it into barley broth. This is a 
very economical, nourishing, and sa- 
voury meal. 

2291. CHILDREN AND CUT- 
LERY. Serious accidents having- oc- 
curred to babies, through their catching 
hold of the blades of sharp instruments, 
the following hint will be useful. If a 
child lays hold of a knife or razor, do 
not try to pull it away, or to force open 
the hand. But holding the child's hand 
that is empty, offer to its other hand, 
anything nice or pretty, and it will im- 
mediately open the hand, and let the 
dangerous instrument fall. 

2292. COFFEE MILK FOR THE SICK 
ROOM. Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground 
coffee, in nearly a pint of milk, a quarter 
of an hour, then put into it a shaving 
or two of isinglass, and clear it ; let 
it boil a few minutes and set it by the 
side of the fire to clarify. This is a very 
fine breakfast; but it should be sweet- 
ened with sugar of a good quality. 

2293. FRECKLES. To disperse 
them, take one ounce of lemon juice, a 
juarter of a drachm of nowdered borax, 



and half a drachm of sugar; mix them, 
and let them stand a few days in a gifts* 
bottle till the liquor is fit for une; tlica 
rub it on the hands and face occa- 
sionally. (See 172.) 

2294. CHLOROFORMING BEES. 
The quantity of chloroform required 
for an ordinary hive is the sixth part o, 
an ounce ; a very large hive may take 
nearly a quarter of an ounce. Set down 
a table opposite to, and about four feet 
distant from the hive ; on the table 
spread a thick linen cloth, in the centre 
of the table place a small shallow 
breakfast plate, which cover with a 
piece of wire gauze, to prevent the bees 
from coming in immediate contact with 
the chloroform. Now quickly and 
cautiously lift the hive from the board 
on which it is^standing, set it down on 
the top of the table, keeping the plate 
in the centre ; cover the hive closely 
up with cloths, and in twenty minutes 
or so the bees are not only sound 
asleep, but not one is left among the 
combs ; the whole of them are lying 
helpless on the table. You now remove 
what honey you think fit, replace the 
hive in its old stand, and the bees, as 
they recover, will return to their domi- 
cile. A bright, calm, sunny day is the 
best; and you should commence your 
operations early in the morning, before 
many of them are abroad. 

2295. ARNICA FOR BITES. A 
correspondent says : " Noticing an ac- 
count of the death of a man from the 
bite of a cat, I beg to trouble you with 
the following case, which occurred to 
myself ; I took a strange dog home, 
which produced consternation among 
the cats. One of them I took up, to 
effect a reconciliation between her and 
the dog. In her terror she bit me so 
severely on the first finger of the left 
hand, as not only to cause four of the 
teeth of her low T er jaw to enter the flesh, 
but so agonizing was her bite that the 
pressure of her palate caused the finger 
to swell at the joint on the opposite side 
to where the lower teeth entered the 
finger. In a minute or two the pain 
was about as excruciating as anythJuf 



EATING AND DRINKING SHOULDN T KEEP US FROM THINKING. 



283 



I ever felt certainly greater than I 
have suffered from a wound. I got 
gome tincture of arnica, diluted with 
about twalve times the quantity of 
water, and proceeded to bathe the fin- 
ger well with it. In about half a min- 
ute the blood began to flow freely, the 
pain ceased, and the swelling abated, 
and up to this moment I have had no 
further inconvenience nor pain, not 
even soreness." 

2298. A VEUY PLEASANT PER- 
FUME, and also preventative against 
moths, may be made of the following 
ingredients : Take of cloves, carraway 
seeds, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, aud 
Tonquin beans, of each one ounce ; then 
add as much Florentine orris-root as 
will equal the other ingredients put 
together. Grind the whole well to 
powder, and then put it in little bags, 
among your clothes, &c. 

2297. MAPS AND CHARTS. 
Maps, charts, or engravings may be 
effectually varnished by running a very 
delicate coating of guttapercha solution 
over their surface. It is perfectly trans- 
parent, aud is said to improve the 
appearance of pictures. By coating 
both sides of important documents they 
can be kept waterproof aud preserved 
perfectly. 

2298. CEMENT FOR LEATHER 
AND CLOTH. An adhesive material 
for uniting the parts of boots and shoes, 
and for the seams of articles of cloth- 
ing, may be made thus : Take one 
pound of gutta percha, four ounces of 
India rubber, two ounces of pitch, one 
ounce of shellac, two ounces of oil. 
The ingredients are to be melted toge- 
ther, and used hot. 

2299. ARTIFICIAL MANNERS. 
Artificial manners, and such as spring 
from good taste and refinement, can 
i over be mistaken, and differ as widely 
as gold and tinsel. How captivating 
is gentleness of manner derived from 
true humility, and how faint is every 
imitation : the one resembles a glorious 
rainbow, spanning a dark cloud the 
other, its pale attendant, the water-gall. 
That sua'ity o/ uatnfr which renders 



a real gentlewoman courteous to all, 
and careful to avoid giving offence, is 
often copied by those who merely sub- 
ject themselves to certain rules of eti- 
quette; but very awkward is the copy! 
Warm professions of regard are be- 
stowed on those who do not expect 
them, and the esteem which is due to 
merit appears to be lavished on every 
one alike. And as true humility, 
blended with a right appreciation of 
self respect, gives a pleasing cast to the 
countenance, so from a sincere and 
open disposition springs that artless 
ness of manner which disarms all preju- 
dice. Feeling, on the contrary, is 
ridiculous when affected, and, even 
when real, should not be too openly 
manifested. Let the manners arise 
from the mind, and let there be no dis- 
guise for the genuine emotions of the 
heart. 

2300. DECOCTION OF SARSA- 
PARILLA. Take four ounces of the 
root, slice it down, put the slices into 
four pints of water, and simmer for 
four hours. Take out the sarsaparilla, 
and beat it into a mash ; but it into the 
liquor again, and boil down to two pints, 
then strain and cool the liquor. Dose 
a wine-glassful three times a-day. 
Use to purify the blood after a course 
of mercury; or indeed whenever any 
taint is given to the constitution, viti- 
ating the blood, and producing eruptive 
affections. 

230 J. HOT WATER. In bruises, 
hot water is most efficacious, both by 
means of insertion and fomentation, in 
removing pain, and totally preventing 
discolouration and stiffness. It has the 
same effect after a blow. It should be 
applied as quickly as possible, and as 
hot as it can be borne. Insertion in hot 
water will cure that troublesome and 
painful thing called a whitlow. The 
efficacy of hot water in preventing the 
ill effects of fatigue is too well known to 
require notice. 

2302 . PRESERVING P O T A- 
TOES. The preservation of potato 
by lipping them in boiling water is a 
val .able and useful discovery. 



1:84 



IF THERE WERE NO CLOUDS, WK SHOULD NOT ENJOY THE SUN. 



quantities may be cured at once, by 
putting them into a basket as large as 
the vessel containing the boiling wate 
will admit, and then just dipping thei 
a minute or two at the utmost. Tin 
germ, which is so near the skin, isthm 
destroyed without injury to the potato 
In this way several tons might be curec 
in a few hours They should be then 
dried in a warm oven, and laid up in 
sacks, secure from the frost, in a dry 
place. (See 122 to 135.) 

2303. SQUINTING. Squinting fre- 

of the eyes, the weaker eye being 
turned away from the object, to avoid 
the fatigue of exertion. Cases of 
squinting of long standing have often 
been cured by covering the stronger 
eye, and thereby compelling the weaker 
one to exertion. 

2304. SCRATCHES. Trifling as 

scratches often seem, they ought never 
to be neglected, but should be covered 
and protected, and kept clean and dry, 
until they have completely healed. If 
there is the least appearance of inflam- 
mation, no time should be lost in apply- 
ing a large bread and water poultice, 
or hot flannels repeatedly applied, or 
even leeches in good numbers may be 
put on at some distance from each 
other. 

2305. BLACK OR WHITE EL- 
DERBERRY WINE. Gather the 
berries ripe and dry, prick them, bruise 
them with your hands, and strain them. 
Set the liquor by in glazed earthen ves- 
sels for twelve hours to settle ; put to 
every pint of juice a pint and a half of 
v/ater, and to every gallon of this liquor 
three pounds of good moist sugar ; set 
in a kettle over the rire, and when it is 
ready to boil clarify it with the white 
of four or five eggs; let it boil one 
hour, and when it is almost cold, work 
it with strong ale yeast, and turn it, 
filling up the vessel from time to time 
with the same liquor, saved on purpose, 
as it sinks by working. In a month's 
time, if the vessel holds about eight 

it tvi ! be fine and fit to bottle, 



and, after bottling, will be fit to drink 
in twelve months. 

2300. DRY COUGH. Take of 
powdered gum-arabic, half an ounce ; 
liquorice-juice, half an ounce. Die- 
solve the gum first in warm water 
squeeze in the juice of a lemon, then 
add of paregoric two drachms ; syrup 
of squills, one drachm. Cork all in a 
bottle, and shake well. Take one 
teaspoonful when the cough is trouble- 
some. (See 996). 

2307. CLEAN WHITE VEILS. 
Put the veil in a solution of white soap 
and let it simmer a quarter of an hour 
squeeze it in some warm water am 1 
soap till quite clean. Rinse it from 
soap, and then in clean cold water, in 
which is a drop of liquid blue ; then 
pour boiling water on tea-spoonful of 
starch, run the veil through this, and 

lear it well by clapping it. Afterwards 
pin it out, keeping the edges straight 
and even. 

2308. CANARIES. To distinguish 
a cock-bird from a hen, observe the 
)ird when it is singing, and if it be a 
cock you will perceive the throat heav 
'ng with a pulse-like motion, a peculiar 

ty which is scarcely perceptible in the 
hen. (See 287). 

2309. Feed young canaries with white 
.nd yolk of hard egg, mixed together 
,vith a little bread steeped in water. 
Dhis should be pressed and placed in 
>ne vessel, while in another should be 

ut some boiled rape-seed, washed in 
resh water. Change the food every 
lay. When they are a month old, put 
hem in separate cages. 

2310. Cut the claws of cage birds 
iccasionally, when they become too 
ong, but in doing so be careful not 
o draw blood. 

2311. BULLFINCHES. Old birds 
hould be fed with German Paste 

. 2, and occasionally rape-seed. The 
Germans occasionally give them a little 
)oppy-seed, and a grain or two of rice, 
teeped in Canary wine, when teaching 
hem to pipe, as a reward for the pro- 
^ress they make. Bird organs, or 
"aseolets, are used to teach them 



TELE HASTY ANGLER LOSES THE FISH. 



285 



They breed three or four times a year. 
The young require to be kept very 
warm, and to be fed every two hours, 
with rape-seed, soaked for several hou^s 
in cold water, afterwards scalded and 
strained, bruised, mixed with bread, 
and moistened 'with milk. One, two, 
or three mouthfuls at a time. 

2312. SQUIRRELS. In a do- 
mestic state there little animals are fed 
with hazel nuts, or indeed any kind 
of nuts; and occasionally bread and 
milk. They should be kept very 
clean. 

2313. LINNETS. Cock-birds are 
browner on the back than the hens, 
and have some of the large feathers of 
the wings white up to the quills. 
Canary 4md hemp-seed, with occasion- 
ally a little groundsel, water-cress, 
ehickweed, &c., constitute their food. 

2314. THRUSHES. A Cock nmy 
be distinguished from a hen by a darker 
back and the more glossy appearance 
of the feathers. The belly also is 
white. Their natural food is insects, 
worms, and snails. In a domesticated 
state they will eat raw meat, but 
snails and worms should be procured 
for them. Young- birds are hatched 
about the middle of April, and should 
be kept very warm. They should be 
fed with raw meat, cut small, or bread 
mixed in milk with hemp-seed well 
bruised ; when they can feed them- 
selves give them lean meat cut small, 
and mixed with bread or German paste, 
plenty of clean water, and keep them 
in a warm, dry, and sunny situation. 
(See 817.) 

2315. WINES FROM RHUBARB, 
GRAPES (UNRIPE), CURRANTS, 
GOOSEBERRIES, &c. The whole 
art of wine-making consists in the pro- 
per management of the fermentation 
process ; the same quantity of fruit, 
whether it be rhubarb, currants, gooPd- 
berries, grapes (unripe), leaves, tops, 
and tendrils, water and sugar, will pro- 
duce two different kinds of wine, '>y 
vary ; ng the process of fermentation 
onty that is, a dry wine like sherry, or 
a brisk one lik^ champagne : hutnfther 



rhubarb, currants, nor gooseberries wiL 
produce a wine with the true cham- 
pagne flavour ; it is to be obtained only 
from the fruit of the grape, ripe or 
unripe, its leaves, tops, and tendrils. 
The receipt I hero give will do for 
rhubarb, or any of the above-mentioned 
fruits. To make ten gallons of cham- 
pagne, imperial measure : Take fifty 
pounds of rhubarb and thirty-seven 
pounds of fine moist sugar. Pro- 
vide a tub that will hold from fifteen 
to twenty gallons, taking care that it 
has a hole for a tap near the bottom. 
In this tub bruise the rhubarb ; when 
done add four gallons of water; let 
the whole be well stirred together; 
cover the tub with a cloth or blanket, 
and let the materials stand for twenty- 
four hours ; then draw off the liquor 
through the tap; add one or two more 
gallons of water to the pulp, let it be 
well stirred, and then allow to remain 
an hour or two to settle, then draw off; 
mix the two liquors together, and in 
it dissolve ^\e sugar. Let the tub be 
made clean, and return the liquor to 
it, cover it with a blanket, and place it 
in a room the temperature of which is 
not below 60 C . Fahr. ; here it is to re- 
main for twenty-four, forty-eight, or 
more hours, until there is an appear- 
ance of fermentation having begun, 
when it should be drawn off into the 
ten-gallon cask, as fine as possible, 
which cask must be filled up to the 
bung-hole with water ; if there is not 
liquor enough, let it lean to one side a 
little, that it may discharge itself; if 
there is any liquor left in the tub not 
quite fine, pass it through flannel, and 
fill up with that instead of water. As 
the fermentation proceeds and tho 
liquor diminishes, it must be filled up 
daily, to encourage the fermentation, 
for ten or twelve days ; it then becomes 
more moderate, when the bung should 
be put in, and a gimlet-hole made at 
the side of it, fitted with a spile ; this 
spile should be taken out every two o 
three days, according to the state of 
the fermentation, for eight or ten days 
to allow some of the carbonic acid ga* 



286 



JOY OFTEN COMES AFTER SORROW, LIKE MORNING AFTER NIGHT. 



to escape. When this state is passed, 
the cask may be kept full by pouring a 
little liquor in at the vent-hole once a 
week or ten days, for three or four 
weeks. This operation is performed at 
long intervals, of a month or more, till 
the end of December, when on a fine 
frosty day it should be drawn off from 
the lees as fine as possible ; the turbid 
part passed through flannel. Make the 
jCask clean, return the liquor to it, with 
'one drachm of isinglass (pure) dissolved 
in a little water; stir the whole to- 
gether, and put the bung in firmly. 
Choose a clear dry day in March for 
bottling it. They should be champagne 
bottles common wine bottles are not 
strong enough ; secure the corks in a 
proper manner with wire, &c. I gen- 
erally make up the liquor to two or 
three pints over the ten gallons, which 
I bottle for the purpose of filling the 
cask as it is wanted. For several years 
past I have made a wine with ripe and 
unripe grapes, according to the season, 
equally aa good as any foreign. It has 
always spirit enough without the addi- 
tion of brandy, which, Dr. Maculloch 
says, in his Treatise onWines (published 
twenty or thirty years ago), spoils all 
wines ; a proper fermentation produces 
spirit enough. The way to obtain a 
dry wine from these materials is to 
keep the cask constantly filled up to 
the bung-hole, daily or every other day, 
as long as any fermentation is percep- 
tible, by applying the ear near to the 
hole : the bung may then be put in 
lightly for a time, before finally fixing 
it ; it may be racked off on a fine day 
in December, and fined with isinglass 
as above directed, and bottled in 
March. Dr: William Bartlett. 

2316. CONVULSIONS. Dr. Wil- 
liamson, reports an interesting and 
remarkable case, in which he saved the 
life of an infant in convulsions, by the 
use of chloroform. He commenced 
the use of it at nine o'clock one even- 
ing, at which period the chiid was 
rapidly sinking, numerous remedies 
naving been already tried without effect. 
He dropped half a drachm of chloro- 



form into a thin muslin handkerchief 
and held it about an inch from the in- 
fant's face. In about two minutes the 
convulsions gave way, and the child fell 
into a sleep. By slightly releasing the 
child from the influence of the chloro 
form, he was able to administer food 
by which the child was nourished and 
strengthened. The chloroform was 
continually administered in the manner 
described, from Friday evening at nine 
o'clock until Monday morning at nine. 
This treatment lasted sixty hours, and 
sixteen ounces of chloroform were used. 
Dr. Williamson says he has no doubt 
that the chloroform was instrumental 
in saying the infant' s life; and that no 
injurious effects, however trivial, from 
the treatment adopted, have- subse- 
quently appeared. 

2317. CORNS. Boil a potato in its 
skin, and after it is boiled take the skin 
and put the inside of it to the corn, 
and leave it on for about twelve hours ; 
at the end of that period the corn will 
be much better. The above useful and 
simple receipt has been tried and found 
to effect a remedy. 

2318. CLEANSING FEATHERS 
OF THEIR ANIMAL OIL. The fol- 
lowing receipt gained a premium from 
the Society of Arts : Take for every 
gallon of clean water one pound of 
quicklime, mix them well together 
and when the undissolved lime is pre- 
cipitated in fine powder, pour off the 
clean lime-water for use. Put the 
feathers to be cleaned in another tub, 
and add to them a quantity of the clean 
lime-water, sufficient to cover them 
about three inches, when well immersed 
and stirred about therein. The feath- 
ers, when thoroughly moistened, will 
sink down, and should remain in the 
lime-water three or four days; after 
which, the foul liquor should be sepa- 
rated from them, by laying them in a 
sieve. The feathers should be iifrer 
wards well washed in clean water, ant! 
dried upon nets, the meshes of which 
may be about the fineness of cabbage- 
nets. The feathers must be, from timg 
to time, shaken on the nets, and as the*

get dry will fall through the raeshee, 
and are to be collected for use. The 
admission of air will be serviceable in 
drying. The process will be completed 
in three weeks; and after being thus 
prepared, the feathers will only require 
to be beaten to get rid of the dust. 
(See 2043.) 

'2319. PRESTON SALTS. Take 
of sal ammoniac and salts of tartar, of 
e;ich about two ounces ; pound up the 
sal ammoniac into small bits, and mix 
them gently with the salts of tartar. 
After being well mixed, add a few drops 
of oil of lavender, sufficient to scent, 
and also a little musk ; stop up in a 
glass bottle, and when required for use, 
add a few drops of water, or spirits of 
hartshorn, when you will immediately 
have strong smelling salts. The musk, 
being expensive, may be omitted; it 
will still be good. Any person can for a 
few pence obtain these ingredients at 
any druggist's, and they will make salts, 
which to buy, prepared, would cost at 
least eighteen pence. 

2320. FIG-PUDDING. Three- 
quarters of a pound of grated bread, 
half a pound of best figs, six ounces of 
suet, six ounces of moist sugar, a tea- 
cupful of milk, and a little nutmeg. 
The figs and suet must be chopped 
very fine. Mix the bread and suet first, 
then the figs, sugar, and nutmegs, one 
egg beaten well, and lastly the milk. 
Boil in a mould four hours. To be eaten 
with sweet sauce. 

2321. PRESERVING EGGS. It 
has been long known to housewives, 
that the great secret of preserving eggs 
fresh, is to place the small end down- 
wards, and keep it in that position 
other requisites not being neglected, 
such as to have the eggs perfectly fresh 
when deposited for keeping, not allow- 
ing them to become wet, keeping them 
cool in warm weather, and avoiding 
freezing in winter. Take an inch-board 
of convenient size, say a foot wide, and 
two and a half feet long, and bore it 
full of holes, each about an inch and 
a half in diameter ; a board of this size 
may have five dozen holes bored in it, 



for as many e^s. ^hen nail strips of 
thin board two inches wide round tha 
edges to serve as a ledge. Boards such 
as this may now be made to constitute 
the shelves of a cupboard in a cool cel- 
lar. The only precaution necessary is 
to place the eggs as fast as they are 
laid in these holes, with the small end 
downwards, and they will keep for 
months perfectly fresh. The great ad 
vantage of this plan is the perfect ease 
with which the fresh eggs are packed 
away, and again obtained when wanted. 
A carpenter would make such a board 
for a trifling charge. (See 497, 790.) 

2322. GUM ARABIC STARCH. 
Take two ounces of white gum arable 
powder, put it into a pitcher, and pour 
on it a pint or more of boiling water 
(according to the degree of strength 
you desire), and then, having covered 
it, let it set all night. In the morning 
pour it carefully from the dregs into a 
clean bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. 
A tablespoonful of gum water stirred 
into a pint of starch that has been 
made in the usual manner, will give 
the lawns (either white, black, or print- 
ed), a look of newness, when nothing 
else can restore them after washing. 
It is also good, much diluted, for thin 
white muslin and bobbinet, 

2323. HOME-MADE BREAD-- 
To one quartern of flour (three pounds 
and a-half), and a dessert-spoonful oi 
salt, and mix them well ; mix about two 
table spoonfuls of good fresh yeast (se.& 
2160) with half-a-pint of water a little 
warm, but not hot ; make a hole with 
your hand in the middle of the flour, 
but not quite touching the bottom of 
the pan ; pour the water and yeast 
into this hole, and stir it with a spoon 
till you have made a thin batter ; 
sprinkle this over with flour, cover the 
pan over with a dry cloth, arid let it 
stand in a warm room for an hour ; not 
near the fire, except in cold weather, 
and then not too close ; then add a pint 
of water a little warm, and knead the 
whole well -ogether, till the dough 
comes clean through the hand ; some 
flour will require a i?ttle more water-

but in this experience must be your 
guidt- : let it stand again for about a 
quarter of an hour, and then bake at 
pleasure. 

2;h>4. TO MAKE BREAD WITH 
GERMAN YEAST. To one quartern 
of flour add a dessert-spoonful of salt 
as before ; dissolve one ounce of dried 
German yeast in about three table- 
spoonfuls of cold water, add to this one 
pint and a half of water a little warm, 
and pour the Avhole into the flour; 
knead it well immediately, and let it 
stand as before directed for an hour ; 
then bake at pleasure. It will not hurt 
if you make up a peck of flour at once, 
and bake three or four loaves in suc- 
cession, provided you do not keep the 
dough too warm. German yeast may 
be obtained at almost any corn-chan- 
dler's in the metropolis and suburbs. 
In winter it will keep good for a week 
in a dry place, and in summer it should 
be kept in cold water, and the water 
changed every day. Wheat-meal re- 

E'res a little more yeast than fine 
r, or a longer time to stand in the 
dough for rising. 

2325. PICKLING.-Thereare three 
metheds of pickling ; the most simple 
is, merely to put the article into cold 
vinegar. The strongest pickling vine- 
gar of white wine should always be 
used for pickles ; and for such a's are 
wanted for white pickles, use distilled 
vinegar. This method we recommend 
for all such vegetables au, being hot 
themselves, do not require the addition 
of spice, and such as do not require to 
be softened by heat, such as capsicums, 
chili, nasturtiums, button onions, radish- 
pods, horseradish, garlic, and eschalots. 
Half fill the jais with best vinegar, fill 
them up with the vegetables, and tie 
down immediately with bladder and 
leather. One advantage of this plan is, 
that those who grow nasturtiums, 
radish-pods, and so forth, in their own 
gardens, may gather them from day to 
day when they are exactly of the proper 
growth. They are very much better 
if pickled quite fresh, and all of a size, 
which can scarcely be obtained if they 



be pickled all at the pa mo t'nie. Th 
onions should be dropped in the vine 
gar as fast as peeled ; this secures then 
colour. The horseradish should be 
scraped a little outside, and cut up in 
rounds half an inch deep. Barberries 
for garnish; gather fine full bunches 
before they are quite ripe ; pick away 
all bits of stalk, and leaf, and injured 
berries, and drop them in cold vinegar; 
they may be kept in salt and water, 
changing the brine whenever it begins 
to ferment ; but the vinegar is best. 

2326. THE SECOND METHOD OP 
PICKLING is that of heating vinegar and 
spice, and pouring them hot over thd 
vegetables to be pickled, which arc 
previously prepared by sprinkling with 
salt, or immersing in brine. It is better 
not to boil the vinegar, by which pro- 
cess its strength is evaporated. Put 
the vinegar and spice into a jar, bung 
it down tightly, tie a bladder over, and 
let it stand on the hob or on a trivet 
by the side of the fire for three or four 
days, well shaken three or four times 
a day ; this method may be applied to 
gherkins, French beans, cabbage, bro- 
coli, cauliflowers, onions, and so forth. 

2327. THE THIRD METHOD OF PICK- 
LING is when the vegetables are in a 
greater or less degree done over the 
fire. Walnuts, artichokes, artichoke 
bottoms, and beet-roots are done thus, 
and sometimes onions and cauliflowers. 

2328. FRENCH BEANS. The best sort 
for this purpose are white runners. 
They are very large, long beans, but 
should be gathered quite young, before 
they are half grown ; they may be done 
in the same way as gherkins, but will 
not require so long a time. 

2329. ONIONS. Onions should be 
chosen about the size of marbles, the 
silver-skinned sort are the best. Pre- 
pare a brine and put them into it hot; 
let them remain one or two days, then 
drain them, and, when quite dry, put 
them into clean dry jars, and cover them 
with hot pickle, in every quart of which 
has been steeped one ounce each ol 
horseradish sliced, black pepper, all- 
sp ",e, ind salt, with or without mustard

seed. In all picklos the vinegar should 
always be two inches or more above 
the vegetables, as it is sure to shrink, 
and if the vegetables are not thorough- 
ly immersed in pickle they will not 
keep. 

2380. RED CABBAGE. Choose fine 
linn cabbages : the largest are not the 
best: trim off the outside leaves ; quar- 
ter the cabbage, take out the large 
p. talk, slice the quarters into a colander, 
and sprinkle a little salt between the 
layers ; put but a little salt too much 
will spoil the colour ; let it remain in 
the colander till next day,, shake it 
well, that all the brine may run off; put 
>t in jars, cover it with a hot pickle 
composed of black pepper and allspice, 
of each an ounce ; ginger pounded, 
norseradish sliced, and salt, of each half 
an ounce to every quart of vinegar 
(steeped as above directed); two capsi- 
cums may be added to a quart, or one 
drachm of cayenne. 

2331. GARLIC AND ESCHALOTS. 
Garlic and eschalots may be pickled in 
the same way as onions. 

2332. MELONS, MANGOES, AND LONG 
CUCUMBERS may all be done in the 
same manner. Melons should not be 
much more than half grown ; cucum- 
bers fuU grown, but not overgrown. 
Cut oft' the top, but leave it hanging by 
a bit of rind, which is to serve as a hinge 
to a box-lid ; with a marrow-spoon scoop 
out all the seeds, and till the fruit with 
equal p,\rts of mustard seed, ground 
pepper, and ginger, or flour of mustard 
instead of the seed, and two or three 
cloves of garlic. The lid which incloses 
the spice may be sewed down or tied, 
by running a white thread through the 
cucumber, and through the lid, and 
then, tying i together, cut off the ends. 
The pickle may be prepared with the 
spices directed for cucumbers, or with 
the following, which bears a nearer re- 
semblance to India. To each quart of 
vinegar put salt, flour of mustard, curry 
powder, bruised ginger, turmeric, half 
an ounce of each, cayenne pepper one 
drachm, all rubbed together with a 
large glassful of salad oil ; eschalots 



two ounces, and garlic half an ounce, 
sliced ; steep the spice in vinegar as be- 
fore directed, and put the vegetables 
into it hot. 

2333. CAULIFLOWER. Choose such 
as are firm, yet of their full size ; cuJ 
away all the leaves, and pare the stalk , 
pull away the flowers by bunches, steep 
in brine two days, then drain them ; 
wipe them dry and put them into hot 
pickle ; or merely infuse for three days 
three ounces of curry powder hi eve-iy 
quart of vinegar. 

2334. WALNUTS. Be particular in 
obtaining them exactly at the proper 
season ; if they go beyond the middle 
of July, there is danger of their becom- 
ing hard and woody. Steep them a 
week in brine. If they are wanted to 
be soon ready for use, prick them with 
a pin, or run a larding- pin several times 
through them ; but if they are not 
wanted in haste, this method had better 
be left alone. Put them into a kettle of 
brine, and give them a gentle simmer, 
then drain them on a sieve and lay them 
on fish drainers in any airy place, until 
they become black, which may be twx> 
days ; then add hot pickle of vinegar in 
which has been steeped, in the propor 
tion of a quart, black pepper one ounce, 
ginger, eschalots, salt, and mustard 
seed, one ounce each. Most pickle vine- 
gar, when the vegetables are used, may 
b6 turned to use, walnut pickle in par- 
ticular ; boil it up, allowing to each 
quart four ur six anchovies chopped 
small, and a large table-spoonful of 
eschalots, also chopped. Let it stand a 
few days, till it is quite clear, then pour 
off and bottle. It is an excellent store 
sauce for hashes, fish, and various 
other purposes. 

2335. BEET-ROOTS. Boil or ball 
gently until they are nearly done ; ao 
cording to the size of the root, they 
will require from an hour and a half to 
two hours ; drain them, and when they 
begin to cool peel and cut in slices hall 
an inch thick, then put them into a 
pickle composed of black pepper and 
allspice, of each one ounce, gingei 
pounded, horseradish sliced, and salfc 



290 



HUNGER IS THK BEST- SAUCE. 



of each half an ounce to every quart of 
vinegar, steeped. Two capsicums may 
be .added to a quart, or one drachm of 
cayenne. 

2336. ARTICHOKES. Gather young 
artichokes as soon as formed ; throw 
them into boiling brine, and let them 
boil two minutes ; drain them ; when 
void and dry put them in jars, and cover 
with vinegar, prepared as in method the 
third, but the only spices employed 
should be ginger, mace, and nutmeg. 

2337. AKTICIIOKE BOTTOMS. Get full- 
grown artichokes and boil them, but 
not so much as for eating, but just 
until the leaves can be pulled ; remove 
them and the choke ; in taking off the 
stalk, be careful not to break it off 
so as to bring away any of the bottom ; 
it would be better to pare them with a 
silver knife, and leave half an inch of 
tender stalk corning to a point ; when 
cold, add vinegar and spice, the same 
as for artichokes. 

2338. MUSHROOMS. Choose small 
white mushrooms ; they should be but 
one night's growth. Cut off the roots 
and rub the mushrooms clean with a bit 
of flannel and salt ; put them in ajar, 
allowing to every quart of mushrooms 
one ounce each of salt and ginger, half 
an ounce of whole pepper, eight blades 
of mace, a bay leaf, a strip of lemon 
rind, and a wine-glassful of sherry ; 
cover the jar close, and let it stand on 
the hob or on a stove, so as to be 
thoroughly heated, and on the point of 
boiling ; so let it remain a day or two, 
till the liquor is absorbed by the mush- 
rooms and spices ; then cover them with 
hot vinegar, close them again, and stand 
till it just comes to a boil ; then take 
them away from the fire. When they 
are quite cold divide the mushrooms 
and spice into wide-mouthed bottles, 
fill them up with the vinegar, and tie 
them over. In a week's time, if the 
vinegar has shrunk so as not entirely 
to cover the mushrooms, add cold vine- 
fi ar. At the top of each bottle put a 
tea spoonful of salad or almond oil ; cork 
close, and dip in bottle resin. (See 
2150,2151.) 



2339. SAMPHIRE. On the sea-coast 
this is merely preserved in water, or 

qual parts of sea-water and vinegar ; 
but as it is sometimes sent fresh as a 
present to inland parts, the best way ol 
managing it under such circumstances 
is to steep it two days in brine, then 
drain and put it in a stone jar covered 
with vinegar, and having a lid, over 
which put thick paste of flour and 
w r ater, and set it in a very cool oven all 
night, or in a warmer oven till it nearly, 
but not quite boils. Then let it stand 
on a warm hob for half an hour, and 
let it become quite cold before the 
paste is removed ; then add cold vinegar 
if any more is required, and secure as 
other pickles. 

2340, INDIAN PICKLE. The vege- 
tables to be employed for this fa- 
vourite pickle are small hard knots of 
white cabbage sliced, cauliflowers or 
brocoli in flakes, long carrots, not larger 
than a finger, or large carrots sliced 
(the former are far preferable), gher 
kins, French beans, small botton 
onions, white turnip radishes half grown, 
radish pods, eschalots, young hard 
apples, green peaches when the trees 
are thinned before the stones begin to 
form, vegetable marrow not larger than 
a hen's egg, small green melons, celery, 
shoots of green elder, horseradish, nas- 
turtiums, capsicums, and garlic. As 
all these vegetables do not come in sea- 
son together, the best method of doing 
this is to prepare a large jar of pickle at 
such time of the year as most of the 
things may be obtained, and add the 
others as they come in season. Thus 
the pickle will be nearly a year in 
making, and ought to stand another 
year before using, when, if properly 
managed, it will be excellent, but will 
keep and continue to improve for years. 
For preparing the several vegetables, 
the same directions may be observed 
as for pickling them separately, only 
take this general rule that, if possible, 
boiling is to be avoided, and soaking in 
brine to be preferred ; be very parti- 
cular that every ingredient is perfectly 
dry before putting into the jar, and 



CONTENTMENT WILL BOTH CLOT1IK AND FEED. 



291 



that the jar is very closely tied 
down every time that it is opened for 
the addition of fresh vegetables. Nei- 
ther mushrooms, walnuts, nor mi cab- 
bage are to be admitted. For the 
pickle : To a gallon of the best white 
wine vinegar add salt three ounces, flour 
of mustard half a pound, turmeric two 
Dunces, white ginger sliced three 
ounces, cloves one ounce, mace, black 
pepper, long pepper, white pepper, half 
an ounce each, cayenne two dracnms, 
eschalots peeled four ounces, garlic 
peeled two ounces ; steep the spice in 
vinegar on the hob or trivet for two or 
three days. The mustard and turmeric 
must be rubbed smooth with a little 
cold vinegar, and stirred into the rest 
when as near boiling as possible. Such 
vegetables as are ready may be put in; 
when cayenne, nasturtiums, or any 
other vegetables mentioned in the lirst 
method of pickling corne in season, put 
them in the pickle as they are ; any in 
the second method, a small quantity of 
hot vinegar without spice ; when cold 
pour it off, and put the vegetables into 
the general jar. If the vegetables are 
greened in vinegar, as French beans 
and gherkins, this will not be so neces- 
sary, but will be an improvement to all. 
Onions had better not be wet at ail ; 
but if it be desired not to have the lull 
flavour, both onions, eschalots, and 
garlic, may be sprinkled with salt in a 
colander, to draw off all the strong 
juice ; let them lie two or three hours. 
The elder apples, peaches, and so forth, 
to be greened as gherkins. 

2341. THE ROOTS, radishes, carrots, 
celery, are only soaked in brine and 
dried. Half a pint of salad oil, or of 
mustard oil, is fioinetimes added. It 
should be rubbed with the flour of 
mustard and turmeric. It is not essen- 
tial to Indian pickle to have every 
variety of vegetable here mentioned ; 
but all these are admissible, and the 
greater variety the more it is approved. 

2342. BLACKBIRDS. The cock 
bird is of a deep black, with a yellow 
bill. The female is dark drown. It is 
difficult to distinguish male from female 

13 



birds when young; but the darkest 
generally are males. Their food con- 
sists of German paste (817), bread, 
meat, and bits of apple. The same 
treatment as given for the thrush ap- 
plies to the blackbird. (See 823.) 

2343. SKYLARKS. The cock is 
recognized by the largeness of his eye, 
the length of Ms claws, the mode 01 
erecting his crest, and by marks of white 
in the tail. It is also a larger bird 
than the hen. 

The cage should be of the following 
proportions : Length, one foot five 
inches ; width, nine inches ; height, 
one foot three inches. There should 
be a circular projection in front, to 
admit of a fresh turf being placed 
every two or three days, and the bot- 
tom of the cage should be plentifully 
and constantly sprinkled with river 
sand. All vessels containing food should 
be placed outside, and the top of the 
cage should be arched and padded, so 
that the bird may not injure itself by 
jumping about. 

Their food, in a natural state, con- 
sists of seeds, insects, and also buds, 
green hesbage, as clover, endive, let- 
tuce, &c., and occasionally berries. 

When confined, they are usually fed 
with a paste made in the following man 
ner: Take a portion of bread, well-baked 
and stale, put it into fresh water, and 
leave it until quite soaked through, 
then squeeze out the water and pour 
boiled milk over it, adding two-thirds 
of the same quantity of barley-meal 
well sifted, or, what is better, wheat 
meal. This should be made fresh every 
two days. Occasionally the yolk of a 
hard-boiled egg should be crumbled 
small and given to the birds, as well as 
a little hempseed, meal-worms, and 
elderberries. Great cleanliness shoul 
be observed in the cages of these birds 

2344. CORNS. The cause of corng 
is simply friction; and to lessen the 
friction you have only to use your toe as 
you do a coach- wheel lubricate it with 
some oily substance. The best and 
cleanest thing to use is a little sweet 
oil, rubbed on the affected part (after

the corn is carefully pared) with the tip 
of the finger, which should be done on 
getting up in the morning and just be- 
wre stepping into bed at night. In a 
rew days the pain will diminish, and in 
* few day* more it will cease, when the 
nightly application may be discontinu- 
ed. 

23-15. HINTS ON ETIQUETTE. 
There are numberless writers upon this 
subject, from Chesterfield to Willis, but 
the great fault with all of them is, that 
their works are designed exclusively 
for the ban ton. They are very well 
for those who spend their whole lives 
in the fashionable circles ; but if a plain, 
unpretending man or woman were to 
follow their directions, they would only 
make themselves ridiculous. 

In view of this fact, I now present a 
few plain directions fashioned not after 
an imaginary model, but upon the world 
as it is. I address only sensible per- 
sons, and expect them to be satisfied 
with such rules and principles as shall 
form well-bred men and women, and 
not coxcombs and dandies. My direc- 
tions are the result of my own observa- 
tion and experience, and may be relied 
upon as being the actual practices of 
respectable people, both in this country 
and Europe ; for the manners of well- 
ored people are the same in all parts 
of the world. 

In all your associations, keep con- 
stantly in view the adage, " too much 
freedom breeds contempt." 

Never be guilty of practical jokes; 
if you accustom yourself to them, it is 
probable you will become so habituated 
as to commit them upon persons who 
will not allow of such liberties : I have 
known a duel to arise from a slap on 
the back. 

If there be another chair in the room, 
do not offer a lady that from which you 
have just risen. 

Always suspect the advances of any 
person who may wish for your acquaint- 
ance, and who has had no introduc- 
tion : circumstances may qualify this 
remark, but as a general principle, ac- 
quaintances made in a public room or 



place of amusement are not desir 
able. 

Never converse while a person ii 
singing ; it is an insult not only to the 
singer, but to the company. 

The essential part of good breeding is 
the practical desire to afford pleasure, 
and to avoid giving pain. Any man 
possessing this desire, requires only op- 
portunity and observation to make him 
a gentleman. 

Always take off your hat when hand- 
ing a lady to her carriage, or the box of 
a theatre, or a public room. 

If, in a public promenade, you pass 
and re-pass persons of your acquaint- 
ance, it is only necessary to salute them 
on the first occasion. 

Do not affect singularity of dress by 
wearing anything that is so conspicuous, 
as to demand attention ; and particular- 
ly avoid what I believe I must call the 
ruffian style. 

Never lose your temper at cards, and 
particularly avoid the exhibition of 
anxiety or vexation at w r ant of ne 
cess. If you are playing whist, not 
only keep your temper, but hold your 
tongue ; any intimation to your partwei 
is decidedly ungentlemanly. 

Let presents to a young lady be char 
acterized by taste not remarkable fo 
intrinsic value. 

Except under very decided circum 
stances, it is both ungentlemanly an* 1 
dangerous to cut a person : if you wish 
to rid yourself of any one's society, & 
cold bow in the street, and particular 
ceremony in the circles of your mutual 
acquaintance, is the best mode of con 
duct to adopt. 

Never introduce your own affairs fo- 
the amusement of a company ; it show? 
a sad want of mental cultivation, or ex 
cessive weakness of intellect : recoJ 
lect, also, that such a discussion canco* 
be interesting to others, and that th 
probability is that the most patient 
listener is a complete gossip, laying the 
foundation for some tale to make you 
appear ridicuP is. 

When you meet a gentleman witk 
whom you are acquainted, you bow 



A CUP MUST BE BITTER THAT A SMILE WILL NOT SWEETEN. 



293 



raising your hat slightly with the left 
hand, which leaves your right at liberty 
to shake hands if you stop. If the 
gentleman is ungloved, you must take 
off yours, not otherwise. 

Meeting ii lady, the rule is that she 
should make the first salute, or at least 
indicate by her manner that she re- 
cognizes you. Your bow must be 
lower, and your hat carried further 
from your head ; but you never offer to 
shake hands ; that is her privilege. 

The right, being the post of honor, 
is given to superiors and ladies, except 
in the street, when they take the wall, 
as farthest from danger from passing 
carriages, in walking with or meeting 
them. 

In walking with a lady, you are not 
bound to recognize gentlemen with 
whom she is not acquainted, nor have 
they, in such a case, any right to salute, 
much less to speak to you. 

Whenever or wherever you stand, to 
converse with a lady, or while handing 
her into or out of a carriage, keep your 
hat in your hand. 

Should her shoe become unlaced, or 
her dress in any manner disordered, fail 
not to apprize her of it, respectfully, 
and offer your assistance. A gentle- 
man may hook a dress or lace a shoe 
with perfect propriety, and should be 
able to do so gracefully. 

Whether with a lady or gentleman, 
a street talk should be a short one ; 
and in either case, when you have 
passed the customary compliments, if 
you wish to continue the conversation, 
you must say, " Permit me to accompany 
you." 

Don't sing, hum, whistle, or talk to 
yourself, in walking. Endeavor, besides 
being well dressed, to have a calm good- 
natured countenance. A scowl always 
begets wrinkles. It is best not to 
srnoKe at all in public, but none but a 
ruffian in grain will inflict upon society 
the odor of a bad cigar, or that of any 
kind, on ladies. 

Ladies are not allowed, upon ordinary 
occasions, to take the arm of any one 
a relative or an accepted lover in 



the street, and in the day time ; in the 
evening in the fields, or iu a crowd, 
wherever she may need protection 
she should not refuse it. She should 
pass her hand over the gentleman's 
arm, merely, but should not walk at 
arm's length apart, as country girls 
sometimes do. In walking with a gen- 
tleman, the step of the lady must be 
lengthened, and his shortened, to pre- 
vent the hobbling appearance of not 
keeping step. Of course, the conver- 
sation of a stranger, beyond asking a 
necessary question, must be consider- 
ed as a gross insult, and repelled with 
proper spirit. 

Having dressed yourself, pay no 
further attention to your clothes. . Few 
things look worse than a continual 
fussing with your attire. 

Never scratch your head, pick your 
teeth, clean your nails, or worse than 
all, pick your nose in company ; al) 
these things are disgusting. Spit as 
little as possible, and never upon the 
floor. 

Do not lounge on sofas, nor tip back 
your chair, nor elevate your feet. 

If you are going into the company of 
ladies, beware or onions, spirits, and 
tobacco. 

If you can sing or play, do so at once 
when requested, without requiring to 
be pressed, or make a fuss. On the 
other hand, let your performance be 
brief, or, if ever so good, it will be tire- 
some. When a lady sits down to the 
pianoforte, some gentleman should at- 
tend her, arrange the music-stool, and 
turn over the leffves. 

Meeting friends in a public prome- 
nade, you salute them the first time in 
passing, and not every time you meet. 

Never tattle, nor repeat in one society 
any scandal or personal matter you 
hear in another. Give your own 
opinion of people, if you please, but 
never repeat that of others. 

Meeting an acquaintance among 
strangers, in the street or a coffee-house, 
never address him by name. It is vul 



gar and annoying. 
2354. LAWS 



OF CHESS. The 



294 



GUARD WELL THE STEPS OF THE YOUTHFUL. 



rules given below are based upon the 
ci><lo published in " Walkers Art of 
('lira* Play." The word piece frequently 
includes \\\e pawn. 

2355. I. If the board or pieces be 
improperly placed, or are deficient in 
number (except in the case of odds), 
the game must be recommenced, if the 
error is discovered before the fourth 
move on each side (the eighth move ot 
the game). If not discovered before 
this stage, the game must proceed. 

2356. II. If the player gives odds, and 
yet omits to remove the odds from the 
board at the commencement, he may 
recommence the game, and remove the 
odds given, provided he discover his 
error before playing his fourth move. 
But if he has made his fourth move, 
the game must be played out ; and 
should the player who agreed to give 
the odds win the game, it shall never- 
theless be considered drawn. 

2357. III. When parties play even, 
they draw lots for the first move of the 
first game. The first move is after- 
wards taken alternately throughout the 
sitting, except when a game is drawn, 
when he who had the first move in 
that game still claims it, a drawn game 
being of no account. He who gains the 
move has also the choice of colour. 
Each player uses the same colour 
throughout the sitting. When a match 
is made for a given number of games, 
the move passes alternately throughout 
the match. A player giving odds has 
the choice of men, and takes the move 
in every game, unless agreed to the 
contrary. 

2358. IV. A player who gives the odds 
of a piece, may give it each game from 
the king's or queen's side, at his option. 
If he gives the odds of a pawn, he must 
give the king's bishop's pawn, unless 
otherwise stipulated. The player who 
receives the odds of a certain number 
of moves at the commencement, must 
not with those moves cross from his 
own half of the board. 

2359. V. If a player, in his turn to 
play, touch one of his men, he must 
mole that piece, if it can legally move, 



unless, when he first touches it, he 
says aloud, j'adoube. No penalty is 
attached to touching a piece, unless it 
is your turn to move. 

23GO. VI. If the player touch hia 
king, with the intention of moving 
him, and then finds that he cannot do so 
without placing the king in check, u 
penalty can be inflicted on his replae'm<> 
his king and moving elsewhere. [Other- 
wise?] If the player should touch a 
man which cannot be moved without 
placing his king in check, he must 
move his king instead. 

2361. VII. If a player about to move 
touch one of his adversary's men, 
without saying j'adoube when he first 
touches it, he must take that piece, if 
it can be lawfully taken. Should it 
not be taken, he must, as a penalty, 
move his king ; but should the king be 
unable to play without going into check, 
no penalty can be enforced. It is not 
allowed to castle upon a compulsory 
move of the king. 

2362. VIII. While you bold your 
piece you may move it anywhere 
allowed by the rules ; but when you 
quit your hold the move is completed, 
and must be abided by. 

2363. IX. If you inadvertently move 
one of your adversary ' s pieces instead 
of your own, he may compel you to 
take the piece you have touched, should 
it be en prise; or to replace it and 
move your king, or to leave it on the 
square to which you have moved it, 
and forego any other move at that time. 
Should you capture one of the adverse 
pieces with another, instead of one of 
your own, the capture holds good if 
your opponent so decides. 

2364. X. If the player takes a piece 
through a false move, his adversary 
may compel him to take such piece 
with one that can lawfully take it, or t 
move the piece that has been touched, 
if such move does not expose the king 
to check, or he may be directed to 
move his king. 

2365. XI. If you take one of your own 
men, instead of one of your adver- 
sary's, you may be compelled to move

295 



one of the two pieces touched, at the 
option of your opponent. Mr. Walker 
thinks that the penalty should be to 
lose the man you have improperly 
taken off. 

2366. XII. Ai. opponent has the 
option of punishing a false move, by 
Claiming the false move as your move, 
by compelling you to move the piece 
touched, as you may think fit, or to 
replace the piece and move your king. 

2367. XIII. The king must never be 
exposed to check by any penalty en- 
forced. 

2368. XIV. If you move twice 
running, you may be compelled to 
abide by both moves, or to retract the 
second. 

2369. XV. Unlimited time is allowed 
for the moves [unless otherwise agreed.] 
If one player insists upon the postpone- 
ment of the termination of a game, 
against the will of his opponent, the 
game is forfeited by him who will not 
play on. 

2370. XVI. When a pawn is moved 
two squares, it is liable to be taken, 
en passant, by a pawn, but not by a piece. 

2371. XVII. If you touch both king 
and rook, intending to castle, you must 
move one of the two pieces, at the 
option of your adversary ; or ho may 
compel you to complete the castling. 
You cannot take a piece and castle at 
the same time ; nor does the rook 
check as it passes to its new position ; 
but it may check on its position after 
castling. 

2372. XVIII. False castling is liable 
to the same penalties as a false move. 

2373. XIX. When a player gives the 
odds of a rook, he does not relinquish 
the right of castling on the side from 
which the rook has been taken, all 
other conditions being lawful, as if the 
rook were in its place. 

2374. XX. When you give check you 
must say so aloud. If check is not 
cjillc.d on either side, but subsequently 
discovered, you must endeavour to re- 
sail all the moves back to the period 
when the check first occirred. 

2375 XX T. You are n?t compelled 



to cry check when you attack the 
queen. 

2376. XXII. If you cry check, and 
afterwards alter your determination, 
you are not compelled to abide by the 
intention, provided you have not 
touched the piece. 

2377. XXIII. When a pawn reaches 
the opposite side of the board it may 
be replaced by any piece, at the option 
of the owner, and irrespective of the 
pieces already owned by him. 

2378. XXIV. Stall-mate is a drawn 
game. 

2379. XXV. Drawn games count for 
nothing ; and he who moved first in 
the drawn game moves first in the fol- 
lowing. 

2380. XXVI. If you declare to win 
a game, or position, and only draw it, 
you are accounted the loser. 

2381. XXVII. When you have either 
of the following advantages of force, 
you are compelled to give check-mate 
in fifty moves, or the game is consi- 
dered drawn. 

King and queen against king. 

King and rook against king. 

King and two bishops against king. 

King, bishop,, and knight, against 
king. 

King and queen against king and 
rook. 

King and rook against king and minor 
piece. 

King and pawn against king. 

King and two pawns against king and 
pawn. 

2382. XXVIII. If you move after 
your adversary has made a false move, 
or committed other irregularity, you 
cannot claim the penalties. 

2383. XXIX. Spectators are for- 
bidden to make remarks.

2385. HINTS UPON MONEY MAT- 
TERS. Have a supply of change in hand. 
This will obviate the various incon. 
veniences of keeping people at the door, 
sending out at unreasonable times, and 
running or calling after any inmate in 
the house, supposed to be better pro-

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, BORN 1706, DIED 1790. 



vided with " the needful " The trades- 
people with whom you regularly deal 
\\ill always give you extra change' when 
you are making purchases or paying 
bills ; while those to whom you apply 
for it on a sudden emergency, may 
neither be willing nor able to do so. 
Some housekeepers object to this 
arrangement that, " as soon as five- 
pound notes or sovereigns are changed, 
they always seem to go, without their 
understanding how ;" but to such 
persons I would humbly intimate, that 
this is rather the fault of their not 
getting understanding, than any inevi- 
table consequence of getting change. 
The fact is, that it is the necessity of 
parting with your money which obliges 
you to get the larger pieces changed, 
and not the circumstance of having 
smaller coin that necessitates your part- 
ing with your money, though it cer- 
tainly facilitates your doing so, when 
1 the necessity arrives. However, as it is 
easier to count a few sovereigns than 
many shillings, and loose money is most 
objectionable, it is well to put up re- 
serve change in small collective packets, 
and to replenish the housekeeping 
purse from these daily or weekly, as 
may be most convenient. 

2386. If money for daily expenses 
has to pass through the hands of a com- 
mon domestic, it is a time and trouble- 
saving plan to settle with her every 
night, and make up her cash in hand to 
a certain similar sum. 

2387. ADULTERATIONS. Much 
has been written upon the subject of 
adulteration. Somebody (whose name 
we forget) took up the subject prior to 
Dr. Hassall ; Dr. Hassall wrote a series 
of papers in the Lancet ; these broug-ht 
about a parliamentary inquiry ; the 
inquiry ended in demonstrating that 
nearly everything we eat and drink 
is adulterated in many cases with 
ingredients very prejudicial to human 
health. Somebody has written a little 
oook to inform people " How to detect 
adulterations in our daily food and 
drink ' and there is room for some one 
to write a key to the said littte book, 



entitled " How to understand the in- 
structions ' How to Detect Adultera 
tion in our Daily Food and Drink' " 
for, although the advertisement of the 
book savs that it gives instructions for 
the employment of " simple means" of 
detection, the means suggested are in 
most cases highly impracticable, and in 
some instances dangerous. Thus tlio 
housewife, who sets about the dis- 
covery of some supposed evil, may, by 
an error or accident the upsetting of 
a bottle of sulphuric acid, or the explo- 
sion of a receiver of gas do herself 
more injury in an hour than she would 
suffer from adulteration in a life-time. 
2388. IMPRACTICABLE MODES OP DE 
TECTION. The writer alluded to states 
that, to discover the adulterations in 
arrowroot, you are to " mix it with 
twice its weight of concentrated muri- 
atic acid." To discover adulterations 
in flour, you are to " take of the sus- 
pected flour about 350 grains, and the 
same quantity of fine sand, and two 
and a-half fluid ounces of water -, tritu- 
rate in a mortar the sand and flour for 
five minutes, then gradually add a 
little of the water, so as to dilute it 
evenly, and form a homogeneous paste ; 
throw the whole upon a filter, and take 
about one ounce of the clear liquid, 
place it in a test-glass, and add the 
same quantity of an aqueous solution 
of iodine." The author remarks, that 
this method is tedious, and far from 
satisfactory. So we think. He then 
gives another : " If chalk be sus- 
pected, place a tea-spoonful of flour in a 
wine-glass, with a little water, and add 
a few drops of muriatic acid. If chalk 
be present, a brisk effervescence will 
ensue, owing to the escape of carbonic 
acid [it should be carbonic acid^as.] 
Lime may be detected in a similar way 
using oxalate of ammonia, instead of 
muriatic acid. The lime will form an 
insoluble precipitate, which is oxalate 
of lime ! ' ' Then, to detect the presence 
of bone-dust, you are told to burn a 
portion of the suspected flour, and " if 
a portion of the ash dissolved in water 
give, with nitrate of silver, an abundani 



THOMAS JEFFERSON, BORN 1743, DIED 1826. 



297 



precipitate, phosphate of lime is pres- 
ent. The test of oxalate of ammonia 
may be used to detect lime in the ash, 
as already advised for its detection in 
flour !" This is the character of by far 
the greater number of these " simple" 
instructions ; and, to crown the whole, 
to enable you to detect adulteration in 
bottled, cured, and potted anchovies, 
with their heads decapitated, and their 
entrails removed, you are favoured with 
Mr. Yarrell's pen-and-ink portrait of 
the fish, when in a living, or at least, a 
fresh and whole condition ! Among 
other adulterations we therefore dis- 
cover the adulteration of books, by 
the introduction of matter to give an 
appearance of learning to their pages, 
and of no possible use to the buyer, 
who is compelled to pay sixpence fur 
what he ought to obtain at one sixth 
that cost. 

'2389. DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING 
ADULTERATIONS. It is obvious, that 
if adulterations could be easily discov- 
ered, tradespeople who resorted to 
them would soon suffer from discredit. 
Many of the adulterations defy even 
the power of the chemist, and Dr. Has- 
sal's investigations are exceedingly im- 
perfect, being chiefly confined to the 
agency of the microscope, and passing 
over a large catalogue of liquid and 
oleaginous compounds. For many 
adulterations, the retail dealer is not 
responsible. Do all he may, he cannot 
obtain a pure article, since it undergoes 
adulteration in every stage of its pro- 
gress to the market, and many sub- 
stances partake of compound adultera- 
tion. Thus Cayenne pepper may be 
adulterated with mustard, which has 
previously been adulterated with a 
cheaper farina, and the whole be 
coloured with vermilion, cochineal, or 
red-lead, either or all of which may 
previously have been adulterated with 
gome inferior substance. 

231)0. How TO ESCAPE ADULTERA- 
TIONS, AND ALSO TO DETECT FRAUD- 
ULENT TRADERS. We are not about 
to advUe the housewife to set up a 
chemical laboratory nor to put her 



husband to the expense of a compound 
achromatic microscope. CKl* instruc- 
tions will neither burn holes in her 
dress, stain her mahogany table, blacken 
her nails, make smarting chaps in her 
hands, nor fill her with monornixniacal 
fears that she is being ossified by bone- 
dust, or that in a liftle while she will 
be crystallized all over like an 
alum-basket. Our apparatus is as fol- 
lows : 

A hand flour-mill, 
A pestle and mortar, 
A coffee-mill, 
A pepper and spice-mill, 
Meat-cutting machine, 
Scales and weights, 
Imperial measures, 

2391. FORMATION OF FAMILY CIE 
CLES. The mill is the most expensive 
item in this table of expenditure and 
what we propose is this: "Family 
Circles " (see 340; should be called, for 
the purpose of mitigating the evils 
complained of. Let every " Circle " 
have its mill let it be kept at a place 
convenient to all. By such means, a 
capital subscribed by each member, 
would be sufficient ; a little company 
would be formed, upon a better 

rinciple than that of " limited lia- 
ility," since the capital being paid 
up, there would be no liability at all ! 
What would be the result ? Why, that 
people would obtain pure bread, pure 
coffee, pure condiments, and other 
"ngs, at a cost of full twenty-five per 
cent, under that which they now pay 
for spurious and health- destroy ing mix- 
tures. 

2392. OTHER EVILS BESIDES 
ADULTERATIONS." The butcher 

cannot adulterate the beef and the 
mutton (see 1), but he can send home 
short weight ; aud the baker, besides 
putting alum in the bread, to make it 
white and retain water, can send home 
deficient weight; the same with the 
grocer, and the coal merchant; th* 
publican can give short measure, and 
froth up the porter to fill the jug, and 
disguise the shortness of quantity ; and 
the draper can slip his scissors th*

wrong side of his finger, and make a 
yard contain only thirty-three inches. 
We don't mean to say that they do this, 
nor do we mean to say that \\\c,j don't. 
We argue, that people ought to possess 
the means of ascertaining who among 
shop-keepers arc honest, and who are not. 
Then the just would meet with justice, 
and the unjust would suffer for their 
.own sins. 

2393. ADULTERATIONS, AND REALLY 
SIMPLE MODES OP DETECTING THEM. 
ARROWROOT is adulterated with po- 
tato-starch, sago, and tapioca-starch. 
There is nothing injurious in these adul- 
terations. When largely adulterated 
with potato-starch, the arrowroot, being 
passed through the hand, imparts a 
slippery and glaze-like feeling. Pure 
arrowroot may generally be obtained 
by paying the best prices. The arrow- 
root packed in tin cases, and puffed as 
pure, may generally be regarded as 



highly adulterated. 

OQO/I 



2394. ANATTO is adulterated with 
chalk, wheat-flour, rye-flour, salt, and 
soap ; and is coloured with Venetian 
red and red lead. It is difficult to 
detect these adulterations. 

2395. A MICROSCOPE will be of 
material assistance in detecting the ad- 
mixture of impure substances with 
articles of food. Even a common phial 
filled with water possesses a high mag- 
nifying power. (See 3778. ) 

2396. BRANDY is adulterated with 
cayenne pepper, water and burnt sugar. 

2397. BREAD. Grind your own 
wheat, make your own yeast, and bake 
your own bread (See'llS, 587, 2077, 
2160,2323). The advantages will be 
immense, and you need not then trouble 
about adulterations. 

2398. The Adulterations of Bread, 8>c. 
Bread and flour are adulterated with 
flour of inferior grain, Indian corn 
flour, potato flour, pea and bean flour, 
bone dust, &c. None of these are posi- 
tively injurious. But they are also 
adulterated with plaster of Paris, chalk, 
alum, &c., and these are highly preju- 
dicial to health, especially when taken 
eontinuously. (See 586.) 



2399. To Discover whether Bread be 
Adulterated icith Alum. Run into a 
loaf that is one day old, a knife made 
,-L-iy hot; if there be alum present, it 
will adhere in very small particles to 
the blade of the knife, and will indicate 
its presence by a peculiar smell. If 
bread looks unnaturally white, and if 
it gives off a good deal of water, and 
becomes veiy brittle and dry when 
toasted, alum may be regarded as being 
present. 

2400. To Discover whether Bread 
be Adulterated with Pea or Bean Flour. 
Pour boiling- water upon it, and if the 
flour is mixed with the farina of peas 
or beans, the strong smell of those 
grains will become manifest. 

2401. To Djpcover whether Flour be 
Adulterated with Chalk, Plaster of 
Paris or Mineral Powders. If con- 
taining these admixtures, it will be 
found to be heavier, measure for meas- 
ure, than pure flour. That is to say, a 
pint of pure flour would be overbalanced 
in the scales by a pint of adulterated 
flour. Slice the soft part of a loaf, 
and put it into a large quantity of 
water in an earth en vessel. Place it 
over a slow fire for three hours. Scoop 
up the pap, and let the water stand. 
When perfectly settled, pour off the 
water, and a chalky sediment will be 
found to cover the bottom of the ves- 
sel. Heartburn, after eating impure 
bread is a sign of its impurity. Put 
some flour upon a table, and blow it 
gently with the breath. If little heaps 
remain upon the table, resisting the 
action of the breath, and differing ma- 
nifestly from the indications given by 
other portions when blown upon, the 
substance thus remaining is impure. 
Potato flour, and indeed all white flours, 
are heavier than pure wheat. Bake a 
small quantity of the suspected flour, 
until it is of a full brown. Then take 
it, and rub in your hands or on a 
table, and white particles will be 
seen, if chalk or plaster of Paris ba 
present. 

2402. Pure Wheat Flour is remark- 
able for its cohesiveuess. If squeezed

may be blown into a cloud with the 

lightest breath. 

2403. BUTTER is made heavy by 
water which may generally be seen 
exuding from bad samples, which 
should It 3 rejected by the purchaser. 

2404. CAYENNE PEPPER. Having 
four own pestle and mortar, make it 
according to the instructions given 
(2165), which are excellent. Let a 
quantity be made at one time for the 
"Family Circle." The cayenne of 
commerce is adulterated with brick- 
dust, red wood dust, cochineal, ver- 
milion, and red-lead. The latter two are 
highly injurious, and the former ones 
not very salutary. As to the means 
of detecting these, it would be a great 
waste of time to find them out, since all 
cayenne is largely adulterated. There- 
fore,, make your own or don't use 
any. 

2405. CHICORY. This is the dried 
and roasted root of a plant allied to the 
dandelion, and it is found by almost 
unanimous testimony to be an agree- 
able flavourer of coffee. Dr. Hassall 
denounces the use of chicory, but with 
no sufficient reason. He states it to be 
" diuretic and aperient' ' qualities 
which we declare to be in its favour, 
for it is the prevailing defect of our 
food that it is too astringent and heat- 
ing, and the fact that chicory finds 
such general approbation we believe 
rests in the very qualities which Dr. 
Hassall condemns. We know a respect- 
able grocer who, before legislation, took 
the matter up from conscientious 
motives, ceased to mix chicory with 
coffee : the immediate effect was the 
falling-off of his coffee trade, his cus- 
tomers declaring that his coffee was not 
so good as previously ; and he was 
compelled again to mix chicory with it 
to meet their taste. Chicory is found 
to be " adulterated" with carrot, pars- 
nips, and mangel-wurzel. In Dr. Has- 
Ball' s papers the name of those roots are 
italicised, as though some dreadful 
tjisclosure lay therein. But as these 
roots are all of them high! uutricious 

13* 



and agreeable, instead of detract 
from the claims of chicory, the 
stated rather elevate " chicory ' ' in our 
estimation, and point to the probability 
that the roots mentioned possess qual- 
ities hitherto imperfectly ascertained, and 
irorthy of further examination and de 
velopment. Our remarks are not merely 
of conjecture, they are founded upon 
observation arid analysis. 

2406. CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 
The adulterations of these articles 
pointed out by Dr. Hassall are not of a 
serious nature, being confined to flour, 
starch, potato-farina, sago-meal, wheat- 
flour, tapioca-starch, Maranta, and other 
arrowroots, tons les mois, and animal 
fats ; but as the latter are employed in 
the roasting of all farinaceous grains, to 
prevent the burning thereof, and also 
to preserve as far as possible their es- 
sential oils from destruction by heat, 
we see nothing to make our readers 
uncomfortable. Those who prefer the 
pure cocoa can obtain the " nibs," or 
more properly" beans," and grind them. 
But many prefer the soluble cocoa, 
which is simply cocoa modified by 
admixture with less stimulating sub- 
stances. 

2407. COFFEE. Coffee is adulterated 
with chicory, roasted beans, peas, and 
acorns; bt hiefly by chicory. Hav- 
ing your own mill, buy the roasted 
beans; find out a respectable grocer, 
ascertain his roasting-days, and always 
buy from a fresh roast If you like the 
flavour of chicory, purchase it sepa 
rate, and'add to taste. Chicoy, in 
small quantities is not, as has been 
represented, injurious, but healthful: 
because the " taraxacum >: root has been 
used medicinally, and its name has 
found a place in Pharmacopseias, it has 
been vulgarly set down as "physic," 
and thrown to the dogs. The tonic hop 
might be discarded upon the same 
pretext. Chicory is a healthful addition 
to coffee, but you need riot pay the 
coffee price for it. Grind your coffee / 
and mix with chicory for yourself. 

2408. CONFECTIONS AND SWEET 
MEATS are coloured with poisonous in

gradients. Avoid them there is not 
the slightest necessity for running any 
risk. ^ 

2409. CURRY-POWDERS are but an 
accumulation of adulterations : adul- 
terated pepper adulterated coriander, 
adulterated c irdamoms, adulterated 
ginger, adulterated spices, and so on. 
ll'itk your spice mill and prater prepare 
your own from the seeaj and roots. 
You will thereby obtain such a curry- 
powder, and be able to produce such 
a curry, as will spread your reputa- 
tion for and wide. (See 168, 234, 
2167, 2168.; 

2410. CUSTARD AND EGG-POWDERS 
contain wheat, potato, and rice-flours, 
and are coloured with chrome yellow, or 
chromate of lead and turmeric. They 
are not essential articles of household 
economy. 

2411. GIN is adulterated with water, 
sugar, cayenne, cassia, cinnamon, grains 
of paradise, sulphuric acid, coriander 
seed, angelica root, calken root, almond 
cake, orris root, cardamom seeds, 
orange peel, and grey and white salts, 
and is " fined ' ' by alum and salts of 
tartar. The best way is to purchase 
the unsweetened gin, for the sweeten- 
ing is employed to disguise the flavour 
of various adulterations. If you ex- 
amine gin through a clean glass, it 
should have no tint, either of a bluish 
or yellowish cast. The cheap gins 
should be avoided, and only the res- 
pectable dealers should be resorted to. 

2412 ISINGLASS. Our chief object 
iu roticing the adulteration of this 
article is to insure its purity in the 
making of cements, which is of the 
utmost importance. (See 78.) Isin- 
glass is a preparation from fishes' 
bladders, and it is found to be adul- 
terated with gelatine. Take a few 
breads of the substance, drop some 
nto boiling water, some into cold 
water and some into vinegar. In the 
boiling water the isinglass will dissolve ; 
in cold water it will become white and 
"cloudy;" and in vinegar it will 
well and become jelly-like. In boiling 
water gelatine will not so con pletcly 



dissolve as isinglass ; in cold water it 
becomes clear and jelly-like; and ip 
vinegar it will harden. 

2413. LARD is adulterated with po- 
tato flour, water, salts, carbonate of 
soda, and caustic lime. Take a small 
portion of the suspected lard, and eva- 
porate it upon a hot iron pan or plate, 
when the admixed substances will be 
deposited thereon. 

2414. MARMALADE is found to be 
adulterated with course apples, Swede 
turnips, and course puopkins. These 
substances may be easily detected by 
washing off the saccharine matter in 
tepid water. Generally speaking, how- 
ever, it is only the low-priced marma- 
lades that are thus admixed. 

2415. MILK is adulterated with water, 
and coloured with anatto. 

2416. MUSTARD AND PEPPER are 
both adulterated with inferior grain, 
husks of seeds, and even dust of a 
variety of descriptions. Having your 
pepper-mill, purchase the seed whole, 
and grind for yourself. You will then 
obtain the pure article at a moderate 
cost. 

2417. OATMEAL is adulterated with 
barley-flour and the husks of barley. 
A pint of pure oatmeal will weigh 
heavier than a pint of the adulterated. 

2418. PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 
These are found to be adulterated with 
various compounds; but the greatest 
evil lies in the fact that they are fre- 
quently impregnated with copper. In 
the case of preserves, the copper prob- 
ably proceeds from the use of copper 
pans in making the preserves, but with 
regard to pickles, copper is employed 
to improve their color, and sulphuric 
acid to strengthen bad vinegar. The 
best way is to avoid purchasing the 
pickles sold in clear glass bottles, and 
presenting a most tempting appear- 
ance. 

2419. POTTED MEATS AND FISH 
are adulterated with inferior sub- 
stances, and colored with bole armenian 
and Venetian red. 

2420. PORTER AND ALB are adulte- 
rated with cocculus indicug, tobacco,

grains of Paradise, capsicum, ginger, 
quassia, wormwood, calamus root, carra- 
way and coriander-seeds, orange pow- 
der, liquorice, honey, sulphate of iron, 
sulphuric acid, cream of tartar, alum, 
carbonate of potash, oyster shells, 
hartshorn shavings, fabia amara, or nux 
vomica, and beans for fining. Beer 
which is quickly " heady" rapidly in- 
toxicating, may be regarded as drug- 
ge'd. The large brewers supply the 
purest. The publicans adulterate after 
they receive supplies from the brew- 
ers. 

2421 . EUM is adulterated with water, 
and sharpened with cayenne pepper. 
Let it stand in a decanter, and if a 
cloudy precipitate is found at the bot- 
tom, that is a sign of adulteration. 

2422. SAUSAGES. The most offensive 
of all adulterations is found in these 
savory morsels. Horseflesh, diseased 
animals, and odds and ends of every 
description, find their way into the 
tempting guise of "sausages." To 
escape from this evil, make your own 
sausages, by the aid of the sausage 
machine, which will enable you to add 
many savory morsels to the attraction 
of your table. The same thing may be 
used for CHOPPING VEGETABLES, which 
it will do to such perfection that 
they will perfectly dissolve in soups 
au.d" stews, and afford most delicious 
i ade dishes. And in this, as in the 
grinding of wheat, you will soon save 
the cost of the machine. 

2423. SNUFF is adulterated with 
the chromates of potash, chromate of 
lead, various earths and colours, red 
lead, carbonate of ammonia, lime, 
powdered glass or silex, and powdered 
orris root. 

2424. SUGAR is commonly adulte- 
rated with fine sand, sawdust, &c. Dis- 
solve some of the sugar in a long, nar- 
row beer-glass, and stir it until all the 
soluble parts have been thoroughly dis- 
solved. Then allow it to stand for 
some ho- rs. Sand will sink to the 
bottom, while sawdust will rise to the 
top. Both the sand and the sawdust 
mrill b i fo"i\d to b*> vory fine, but their 



presence will be sufficiently indicated. 
Loaf sugar is generally purer than 
soft. 

2425. TEA is adulterated with leaves 
of the sycamore, horse chestnut, and 
plum ; with lie tea, which is made up 
of tea dust, sand and gum, to give it 
consistency; also with leaves of the 
beech, bastard plane, elm, poplar, wil- 
low, fancy oak, hawthorn, and sloe. It 
s coloured with black lead, rose pink, 

Dutch pink, vegetable red and yellow 
dyes, arsenite of copper, chromate and 
bichromate of potash. Green teas are 
more adulterated than black. They 
are coloured with Prussian blue, tur- 
meric, Chinese yellow, &c., flavoured 
with sulphate of iron, catechu gum, la 
veno beno, and Chinese botanical pow- 
der. Tea-leaves that have been once 
used are collected, "doctored," and 
again sold as fresh tea. Obtain some 
genuine leaves of tea, moisten them, 
and lay them out with gum upon paper. 
Press them between the leaves of books 
until dry. When you suspect a sample 
of tea, damp and unroll the leaves, and 
gum and dry them as*genuine ones, 
you will then be able by comparison to 
detect the admixture. 

2426. TOBACCO is adulterated with 
rhubarb, potato, coltsfoot, dock-leaves, 
sawdust, malt combings, and medicinals. 
The leaves may be unrolled and com- 
pared, as recommended in the case of 
tea. 

2427. WINES are adulterated with 
the juice of elderberries, gooseberries, 
hop-champagne, cider, the juices of 
various fruits, known as wines, and 
coloured by means of logwood, burnt 
sugar, and other ingredients. There is 
scarcely a drop of pure wine to be ob- 
tained; and the best remedy for this 
department of the evil will be for the 
Government to abolish or reduce the 
duty upon foreign wines, by which 
pure, light and innoxious beverages will 
be introduced, and tht temptation to 
practice adulteration be "eatly dimin- 
ished. 

2428. THE RESULT of ihe** inquirie 
proves that a majority of articles soW 



302 



AXDItKW JACKSON, 



17U7, 1MKD 1M.">. 



are adulterated. But it is also proved 
that a majority of the substances used 
lor adulterations are not positively in- 
jurious, though they are fraudulently 
substituted for the genuine article. 

2429. THE following- are hints which, 
if followed, will turn these discoveries 
to practical account: 

1. Grind your own irhca t,and make 
cur bread at home. 

2. Avoid green pickles. That is, 
pickles artificially raised to a. bright 
green. 

3. Avoid bright-red peppers, spices, 
and sauces. 

4. Purchase spirits and beer of large 
dealers and brcivcrs. 

5. Avoid coloured confections, espe- 
cially those that are green, blue, or 
red. 

6. Weigh and measure your pur- 
chases when they are brought home. 
You will thus not only secure your just 
amount, but will arrive at a knowledge 
of the proper weights of pure articles, 
and be assisted in the rejection of the 
spurious. 

2430. FOR If , SPARE-RIB. Joint 
it nicely before roasting, and crack the 
ribs across as lamb. Take care not to 
have the fire too fierce. It should be 
basted with very little butter and flour, 
and may be sprinkled with dried sage, 
fine.. Takes from two to three hours. 
Apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and 
greens are the proper accompaniments. 
Good mustard, fresh made. 

2431. CUSTARD (BAKED). Boil 
in a pint of milk a few coriander &eeds, 
a little cinnamon and lemon-peel, 
sweeten with four ounces of loaf sugar, 
mix with ;t a pint of cold milk ; beat 
eight eggs for ten minutes 5 add the 
other ingredients ; pour it from one pan 
into another six or eight times, strain 
through a sieve; let it stand; skim the 
froth from the top, fill it in earthen cups, 
and bake immediately in a hot oven; 
pi ve tii em a good colour; ten minutes 
will do them. 

2432. VERMICELLI S O U P . 
Take in th proportions of three quarts 
of grary soup, o- stock, to six ounces 



of vermicelli. Simmer for half an hour, 
stir frequently. 

2433. APPLES for keeping should 
be laid out on a dry lloor for three 
weeks. They then may be packed 
away in layers, with dry straw between 
them. Each apple should be rubbed 
with a dry cloth as it is put away. They 
should be kept in a cool place, but 
should be sufficiently covered with 
straw to protect them from frost. 
They should be plucked on a dry day. 
They also keep if packed in drv sand. 

2434. GINGERBREAD 'APERI 
ENT. Gingerbread, made with oat 
meal or with barley flour, is a very 
agreeable aperient for children. Be- 
ware of giving children medicines too 
frequently. 

2435. EVENING PASTIME. 
Among the innocent recreations of the 
fireside, there are few more commend- 
able and practicable than those afford- 
ed by what are severally termed Ana- 
grams, Charades, Conundrums Enig- 
mas, Puzzles, Rebuses, Riddles, Trans- 
positions,- &c. Of these there are 
such a variety, that they are suited to 
every capacity ; and they present this 
additional attraction, that ingenuity 
may be exercised in the invention ot 
them, as well as in their solution. Many 
persons W 7 ho have become noted for 
their literary compositions may date 
the origin of their success to the time 
when they attempted the composition 
of a trifling enigma or charade. 

2436. ANAGRAMS are formed by the 
transpositions of the letters of w 7 ords or 
sentences, or names of persons, so as to 
produce a word, sentence, or verse of 
pertinent, or of widely different mean- 
ing. They are very difficult to dis- 
cover, but are exceedingly striking 
when good. The following are some o/ 
the most remarkable : 

Transposed forms 

Astronomers No more stars. 
Catalogues Got as a clue. 
Elegant Neat leg. 

Impatient Tim in a p*t. 

Immediately I met my Delia. 
Masquerade Queen a& ma*.

2437. CONUNDRUMS. These are sim- 
ple catches, in which the sense is play- 
fully cheated, and are generally found- 
ed upon words capable of double mean- 
ing. The following are examples : 

Where did Charles the First's exe- 
cutioner dine, and what did he take ? 

He took a chop at the King's Head. 

When is a plant to be dreaded more 
than a mad dog? 

When iCs madder. 

What is Majesty stripped of its ex- 
ternals ? 

It is a jest. [The m and the y, ex- 
ternals, are taken away.] 

Why is hot bread like a caterpillar? 

Because it's the grub that makes the 
butter fly. 

Why should a gouty man make his 
will? 

To have, his legatees (leg at ease). 

Why are bankrupts more to be pitied 
than idiots ? 

Because bankrupts are broken, while 
idiots are only cracked. 

2433. THE CHARADE is a poetical 
or other composition founded upon a 
word, each syllable of which constitutes 
a noun, and the whole of which word 
constitutes another noun of a somewhat 
different meaning from those supplied 
by its separate syllables. Words which 
fully answer these conditions are the best 
for the purposes of charades ; though 
many other words are employed. In 
writing, the first syllable is termed 
<' My first," the second syllable, " My 
aevma," and the complete word, " My 
ichok." The following is an example 
of a Poetical Clnrade ; 



The breath of the morning is sweet, 

The earth is bespangled with flowers; 
And buds in a countless array 

Have oped at the touch of the 

showers. 
The birds whose glad voices aie ever 

A music delightful to hear, 
Seem to welcome the joy of the morn- 
ing 

As the hour of the bridal draws near. 
What is that which now steals on my 

first 
Like a sound from the dream-land of 

love, 
And seems wan<Vring the valleys 

among 

That they may the nuptials approve ? 
'Tis a sound which my second explains, 

And it comes from a sao.red abode, 
And it merrily trills as the villagers 

throng 

To greet the fair bride on her road. 
How meek is her dress, how befitting 

a bride 

So beautiful, spotless, and pure ; 
When she weareth my second, oh, long 

may it be 

Ere her heart shall a sorrow endure. 
See the glittering gem that shines forth 

from her hair 
'Tis my whole which a good father 

gave, 
'Twas worn by her mother with honor 

before 
But she sleeps in peace in her 

grave. 
'Twas her earnest request as she bade 

them adieu, 
That when her dear daughter the 

altar drew near, 
She should wear the same gem that her 

mother had worn 

When she, as a bride, full of promise 
stood there. 

2439. The answer is Ear-ring. The 
bells ring, the sound steals upon the 
ear, and the bride wears an ear-rinu. 
Charades may be sentimental or hu- 
morous, in poetry or prose ; they may 
also be acted, in which manner they 
afford considerable amusement. 

2440. ACTED CHARADES. A draw- 
ins-room with folded doors is the beti

for the purpose. Various household 
appliances are employed to fit up some- 
filing like a stage, and to supply the 
fitting scenes Characters dressed in 
costume, mad 3 up of handkerchiefs, 
coats, shawls, table-covers, &c., come 
on and perform an extempore play, 
founded on the parts of a word, and 
its irAo/c, as indicated above. For in- 
stance, the events explained in the 
poem above might be acted glasses 
might be rung for bells something 
might be said in the course of the 
dialogues about the sound of the bells 
being delightful *<> the ear; there 
might be a dan-je of the villager*, in 
which a ring might be formed ; a wed- 
ding might be performed ; and so on. 
Though for acting Charades there are 
many better words, because Ear-ring 
could with difficulty be represented 
without at once betraying the mean- 
ing.

known. Enigmas may be founded upon 
simple catches, like Conundrums, in 
which form they are usually called 
KIDJJLF..S, such as 

" Though you set me on foot, 

I shall be on my head," 
The answer is, A nail in a shoe. The 
celebrated Enigma, by Lord Byron, 
(see 279, ; age 92), is an admirable spe- 
cii aen of what may be rendered through 
the form of an Enigma. 

ANCIENT ENIGMA. 
The ancients fabled a monster whom 
they named the SPHINX, and whom 
they described as having the head and 
breasts of a woman, the body of a dog, 
the tail of a serpent, the wings of a bird, 
the paws of a lion, and a human voice. 
This monster, it was said, was sent into 
the neighbourhood of Thebes by Juno, 
who wished to punish the family of 
Cadmus. It was further stated, that 
he laid this part of Bceotia under con- 
tinual alarms, by proposing Enigmas, 
and devouring the inhabitants if unable 
to explain them. Also, that as the 
calamity of this monster was become an 
object of public concern, and as the 
successful explanation of an enigma 
would end in the death of the Sphinx, 
Creon promised his crown and Jocasta 
to him who succeeded in the attempt. 
The enigma proposed was this : 

" What animal in the morning walks 
on four feet, at noon on two, and in the 
evening on three '?" 

(Edipus solved the enigma on which 
the monster dashed his head against a 
rock, and perished. 

Answer, MAN: in the morning, or 
days of infancy, he crawls, or walks on 
"all-/ours; at noon, or in the days of 
youth and middle age, he uses two feet 
only ; in the evening, or in his old age, 
be requires the support of a staff, so 
that he may be said to walk upon three 
fi*t. 

24 4'3. REBUSES are a class of enigmas 
generally formed by the first, some- 
times the first and last, letters of words, 
or of transpositions of letters, or addi- 
tions to words. Dr. Johnson, how- 
over, represents Rebus to be a word 



represented by a picture. And putting 
the Doctor's definition and our own 
explanation together, the reader may 
glean a good conception of the nature 
of the Rebus. Example : 
The father of the Grecian Jove : 

A little boy who's blind ; 
The foremost land in all the world, 

The mother of mankind ; 
A poet whose love-sonnets ar 
Still very much admired ; 
The initial letters will declare 

A blessing to the tired. 
Answer Saturn ; Love ; England 
Eve : Plutarch. The initials form 
sleep . 

2444. PUZZLES vary very much. One 
of the simplest that we know is this : 

Take away half of thirteen, and let 
eight remain. 

Write XIII on a slate, or on a piece 
of paper rub out the lower half of the 
figures, and VIII will remain. 
What are termed " practical puzzles' ' 
are cut out of wood, cardboard, ivory, 
&c., and may be purchased at the toy- 
shops. (See 3234.) 

2445. BEDS FOR THE POOR. 
Beech-tree leaves are recommended for 
filling the beds of poor persons. They 
should be gathered on a dry day in the 
autumn, and perfectly dried. It is said 
that they smell grateful, and will not 
harbour vermin. They are also very 
springy. 

2446. PLUM OR APRICOT JAM.-^ 
After taking away the stones from the 
apricots, and cutting out any blemishes 
they may have, put them over a slow 
fire, in a clean stew-pan, with half a 
pint of water : when scalded, rub them 
through a hair sieve ; to every pound of 
pulp put one pound of sifted loaf sugar, 
put it into a preserving-pan over a brisk 
fire, and when it boils skim it well, and 
throw in the kernels of the apricots 
and half an ounce of bitter almonds, 
blanched ; boil it a quarter of an hour 
fast, and stirring it all the time ; re- 
move it from the fire, fill it into 
pots, and cover them. Green gages may 
be done in the same way.

WILLIAM I'EXX, BORX 1G40, DIED 1718. 



~2447. CO VE RING FOR PRE- 
SEEVES. -White paper, cui to a suit- 
able size, dipped in brandy, and put over 
the preserves when cold, and then a 
double paper tied over the top. All 
preserves should stand a night before 
they are covered. (See 61). Instead 
of brandy, the white of eggs may be 
used to glaze the paper covering-, and 
the paper may be pasted round the 
edge of the pot instead of tied it 
will exclude the air better ; and may 
be pasted as well as tied. (See 3118.) 

2448. ARRACK (IMITATIVE) 
Dissolve two scruples of flowers of ben- 
jamin in a quart of best rum, and it 
will impart to it the fragrance of arrack. 

2449. ARROWROOT BLANC- 
MANGE. A tea cupful of arrowroot 
to a pint of milk ; boil the milk with 
twelve sweet and six bitter almonds, 
blanched and beaten ; sweeten with 
loaf sugar, and strain it , break the 
arrowroot with a little of the milk as 
smooth as possible ; pour the boiling 
milk upon it by degrees, stir the while, 
put it back into the pan, and boil a few 
minutes, still stirring ; dip the shape in 
cold water before you put it in, and 
turn it out when cold. 

2450. ARTICHOKES. Soak them 
in cold water, wash them well ; put 
them into plenty of boiling water, with 
a handful of salt, and let them boil 
gently for an hour and a half or two 
hours ; trim them and drain on a sieve ; 
send up melted butter with them, 
which some put into small cups, one 
for each guest. 

2451. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 
may be cooked in the way directed for 
potatoes (123, 128, 131, &c.) 

2452. ASPARAGUS (often miscalled 
" asparagrass"). Scrape the stalks 
till they are clean ; throw them into a 
pan of cold water, tie them up in 
bundles, of about a quarter of a hun- 
dred each ; cut off the stalks at the 
bottom all of a length, leaving enough 
to serve as a handle for the green part ; 
put them into a stew-pan of boiling water, 
with a handful of salt in it. Let it boil, 
and skim it. When they are tender at 



the stalk, ^hich will be in from twenty 
to thirty minutes, they are done 
enough. Watch the exact time of their 
becoming tender ; take them up that 
instant. While the asparagus is boil- 
ing, toast a round of a quartern loaf, 
about half an inch thick ; brown it del- 
icately on both sides ; dip it lightly in 
the liquor the asparagus was boiled in, 
and lay it in the middle of a dish ; melt 
some butter, but do not put it over 
them. Serve butter in a boat. 

2453. APPLE PUDDINGS. One 
pound of flour, six ounces of very finely- 
minced beef suet ; roll thin, and fill 
with one pound and a quarter of boil- 
ing apples : add grated rind and strained 
juice of a small lemon, tie it in a cloth ; 
boil one hour and twenty minutes, or 
longer, in the water. A small slice of 
fresh butter stirred into it when it is 
Sweetened will be an acceptable addi- 
tion ; grated nutmeg, or cinnamon in 
fine powder, may be substituted for 
lemon-rind. For a richer pudding use 
half a pound of butter for the crust, 
and add to the apples a spoonful or two 
of orange or quince marmalade. 

2454. APPLES IN SYRUP.Pare 
and core some hard apples, and throw 
them into a basin of water ; as they are 
done, clarify as much loaf sugar as will 
cover them; put the apples in along 
with the juice and rind of a lemon, and 
let them simmer till they are quite clear; 
care must be taken not to break them ; 
place them on the dish they are to 
appear upon at table, and pour the 
syrup over. These are for immediate 
use. 

2455. VAPOUR BATHS may be made 
by putting boiling water in a pan, and 
placing-a cane bottom chair in the pan, 
the patient sitting upon it, enveloped 
from head to foot in a blanket covering 
the bath. Sulphur, spirit-vapour, 
herbal, and other baths may be obtained 
in the same manner. They should not 
be taken except under medical advice 

2456. BARLEY BROTH (SCOTCH). 
Dr. Kitchener, from whose " Cook'* 
Oracle' ' we take this receipt, after test- 
ing it, says : This is a most frugal, agreo 



DANIEL \7EBSf ER, BORN 1782, DIED 1852.

able, and nutritive meal. It will neither 
lighten the purse nor lie heavy on the 
stomach. It will furnish you with a 
pleasant soup, AND MEAT for eight 
persons. Wash three quarters of a 
puuud of Scotch Barley in a little cold 
water ; put it in a soup-pot with a 
shin or leg of beef, of about ten pounds' 
weight, sawed into four pieces (tell the 
butcher to do this for you) ; cover it 
well with cold water ; set it on the 
fire ; when it boils skim it very clean 
and put in two onions, of about three 
ounces weight each ; set it by the side 
of the fire to simmer very gently about 
two hours ; then skim all the fat clean 
off, and put in two heads of celery, and 
a large turnip cut into small squares ; 
season it with salt, and let it boil an 
hour-and-a-half longer, and it is ready : 
take out the meat (carefully with a 
slice, and cover it up, and set it by the 
fire to keep warm), and skim the broth 
well before you put it in the tureen. 
Put a quart of the soup into a basin, 
put about an ounce of flour into a 
stew-pan, and pour the broth to it by 
degrees, stirring it well together; set it 
on the fire, and stir it till it boils, 
then let it boil up and it is ready. Put 
the meat in a ragout dish, and strain 
the sauce through a sieve over the 
meat ; you may put to it some capers 
or minced gherkins or walnuts, &c. If 
the beef has been stewed with proper 
care in a very gentle manner, and been 
taken up at " the critical moment when 
it is just tender," you will obtain an 
excellent savoury meal for eight people 
at fivepence, i.e., for only the cost of the 
glass of port wine. (At present prices, 
about ninepence per head). The doctor 
omitted potatoes and bread from his cal- 
culation. 

2457. DRYING HERBS Fresh 
herbs are preferable to dried ones, but 
as they cannot always be obtained, it is 
most important to dry herbs at the 
proper seasons :- - 

2458. BASIL is in a fit state for dry- 
ing about the middle of August. 

2459. BURRF.T in June July, and 
August. 



2460. CHERVIL in May, June, and 
July. 

2461. ELDER FLOWERS in May, 
June, and July. 

24G2. FENNEL in May, June, and 
July. 

2463. KNOTTED MARJORAM during 
July. 

2464. LEMON THYME end of July 
and through August. 

2465. MINT end of June and July. 

2466. ORANGE FLOWEBS May, June, 
and July. 

2467. ORANGE THYME (a delicious 
herb), June and July. 

2468. PARSLEY May, June, and July. 

2469. SAGE August and Septem- 
ber. 

2470. SUMMER SAVOURY end of July* 
and August. 

2471. TARROGAN June, July and 
August. 

2472. THYME end of July and Au- 
gust. 

2473. WFNTER SAVOURY end of July 
and August. 

2473*. These herbs always at hand 
will be a great aid to the cook. Herbs 
should bo gathered on a dry day; they 
should be immediately well cleansed, 
and dried by the heat of a stove, or 
Dutch oven. The leaves should then 
be picked off, pounded and sifted, and 
put avvav for use. 

2474. GINGER BISCUITS AND 
CAKES. Work into small crumbs 
three ounces of butter, two pounds of 
flour ; add three ounces of powdered 
sugar and two of ginger, in fine pow 
der, knead into a stiff paste, with new 
milk, roll thin, cut out with a cutter ; 
bake in a slow oven until crisp through, 
keep of a pale colour. Additional 
sugar may be us-ed when sweeter bis- 
cuit is desired. For good ginger-cakes, 
butter six Ounces, sugar eight, for each 
pound of flour; wet the ingredients 
into a paste with eggs ; a little lemon- 
grate will give an agreeable flavour. 

2475. BROWN STOCK may be 
made from all sorts of meat, bones, 
remnants of poultry, game, &e. Tin* 
shin of beef makes an excellent stock- 



BIO 



LA 1'AYETTE, BORN 1757, DIED 1834. 



2476. BROWN STOCK. Put five 

pounds of shin of beef, three pounds of 
knuckle of veal, and some sheep's trot- 
ters or cow-heel into a closely-covered 
stewpan, to draw out the gravy very 
gently, and allow it nearly to dry up, 
until it becomes brown. Then pour in 
sufficient boiling water to entirely cover 
the meat, and let it boil up, skimming 
it frequently ; seasoning it with whole 
peppers, salt, and roots, herbs, and 
vegetables of any kind. That being 
done, let it boil gently five or six hours, 
pour the broth off from the meat, and 
let it stand during the night to cool. 
The following morning take off the 
Bcum and fat, and put it away in a stone 
jar for further use. 

2477. BROWN GRAVY. Three 
onions sliced, and fried in butter to a 
nice brown ; toast a large thin slice of 
bread a considerable time unfil quite 
hard and of a deep brown. Take these, 
with any piece of meat, bone, &c., and 
some herbs, and set them on the fire, 
with water according to judgment, and 
stew down until a thick gravy is pro- 
duced. Season, strain, and keep cool. 

2478. CLEAR GRAVY SOUP. 
This may be made from shin of beef, 
which should not be large or coarse. 
The meat will be found serviceable for 
the t;ible. From ten pounds of the 
meat let the butcher cut off five or six 
from the thick fleshy part, and again 
divide the knuckle, that the whole may 
lie compactly in the vessel in which it 
is to be stewed. Pour in three quarts 
of cold water, and when it has been 
brought slowly to boil, and been well 
skimmed, throw in an ounce and a half 
of salt, half a large teaspoonful of pep- 
per-corns, eight cloves, two blades of 
mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, a 
couple of small carrots, and the heart 
of a root of celery ; to these add a mild 
onion or not, at choice. When the 
whole has stewed, very softly for four 
hours, probe the large bit of beef, and 
if quire tender, lift it out for table ; let 
the soup be simmered from two to three 
hours longer, and then strain it through 
a fine sieve, into a clean pan. When 



it is perfectly cold, clear off every par 
tide of fat ; heat a couple of quarts 
stir in, when it boils, half an ounce of 
sugar, a small table-spoonful of good 
soy, and twice as much of Harvey's 
sauce, or instead of this, of clear and 
fine mushroom catsup. If carefully 
made, the soup will be perfectly trans 
parent and of good colour and flavour 
A thick slice of ham will improve it, 
and a pound or so of the neck of beef 
with an additional pint of .water, will 
likewise enrich its quality. A email 
quantity of good broth may be made of 
the fragments of the whole, boiled 
down with a few fresh vegetables. 

2479. BEEF EXTRACT (AS RECOM- 
MENDED BT BARON LIEBIG). Take a 
pound of good juicy beef, from which 
all the skin and fat has been cut away, 
chop it up like sausage-meat ; mix it 
thoroughly with a pint of cold water, 
place it on the side of the stove to heat 
very slowly, and give an occasiona' 
stir. It may stand two or three hour 
before it is allowed to simmer, and witt 
then require but fifteen minutes of 
gentle boiling. Salt should be added 
when the boiling first commences, anc* 
this, for invalids, in general, is the onlj 
seasoning required. When the extract 
is thus far prepared, it may be poured 
from the meat into a basin, and allowed 
to stand until any particles of fat on the 
surface can be skimmed off, and the 
sediment has subsided and left the soup 
quite clear, when it may be poured off 
gently, heated in a clean saucepan, and 
served. The scum should be well 
cleared as it accumulates. 

2480. BEEF TEA. The above, by 
adding water, formg the best beef tea, 
o-r broth, for invalids. 

2481. ASPARAGUS SOUP. Two 
quarts of good beef or veal steak, four 
onions, two or three turnips, some 
sweet herbs, and the white parts of a 
hundred young aspxragus; if old, halt 
that quantity; and let them simmer tiU 
fit to be rubbed through a tammy, 
strain and season it; have ready the 
boiled green tops of the asparagus, and 
add them to the soup. 



ALL THINGS HAVE A BEGINNING, GOD EXCEPTED. 



311 



2482. BACON. Dr. Kitchener very 
justly says : The boiling of bacon is a 
very simple subject to comment upon ; 
but our main object is to teach com- 
mon cooks the art of dressing common 
food in the best manner. Cover a 
pound of nice streaked bacon with cold 
water, let it boil gently for three-quar- 
ters of an hour; take it up, scrape the 
underside well, and cut off the rind 5 
grace a crust of bread not only on the 
top, but all over it, as you would ham, 
put it before the fire for a few minutes : 
not too long, or it will dry it and spoil 
it. Bacon is sometimes as salt as salt 
can make it, therefore before it is boiled 
it must be soaked in warm water for an 
houi or two, changing the water once ; 
then pare off the rusty and smoked 
part, trim it nicely on the under side, 
and scrape the rind as clean as possi- 
ble. < 

2483. BACON is an extravagant 
article in housekeeping ; there is often 
twice as much dressed as need be ; 
when it is sent to the table as an ac- 
companiment to boiled poultry or veal, a 
pound and a half is plenty for a dozen 
people. A Good German sausage is 
a very economical substitute for bacon ; 
or fried Pork sausage. (See 17, 2172, 
2146.) 

2484. HAM OR BACON SLICES 
should not be more than one-eighth of 
an inch thick, and, for delicate persons, 
(should be soaked in hot water for a 
quarter of an hour, and then well wiped 
and dried before broiling. If you wish 
to cuil it, roll it up, and put a wooden 
skewer through it; then it may be 
dressed in a cheese toaster, or a Dutch 
oven. 

2485. PIC-NIC BISCUITS. Take 
two ounces of fresh butter, and well 
work it with a pound of flour. Mix 
thoroughly with it half a salt-spoonful 
of pure carbonate of soda ; two ounces 
of sugar : mingle thoroughly with the 
flour ; make up the paste with spoonfuls 
of milk ; it will require scarcely a quar- 
ter of a pint. Knead smooth, rool a 
quarter of an inch thick, cut in rounds 
about the size of the top of a small 



wine-glass ; roll these out thin, prick 
them well, lay them on lightly-floured 
tins, and bake in a gentle oven until 
crisp. When cold put into dry canis- 
ters. Thin cream used instead of milk, 
in the paste, will enrich the biscuits. 
Caraway seeds or ginger can be added, 
to vary these at pleasure. (See 473.) 

2486. BLACK PAPER PAT 
TERNS. Mix some lamp-black with 
sweet oil. With a piece of flannel 
cover sheets of writing-paper with the 
mixture ; dab the paper dry with a 
bit of fine linen. When using put the 
black side on another sheet of paper, 
and fasten the corners together with 
small pins. Lay on the back of the 
black paper the pattern to be drawn, 
and go over it with the point of a steel 
drawing pencil ; the black will then 
leave the impression of the pattern on 
the under sheet, on which you may 
draw it with ink. 

2487. PATTERNS ON CLOTH 
OR MUSLIN are drawn with a pen 
dipped in stone blue, a bit of sugar, and 
a little water : wet to the consistence 
wanted. 

2488. BLACK SILK REVIVER. 
Boil logwood in water half an hour; 
then simmer the silk half an hour ; 
take it out, and put into the dye a littlo 
blue vitriol, or green copperas ; cool it 
and simmer the silk for half an hour. 
Or, boil a handful of fig-leaves in two 
quarts of water until it be reduced to 
one pint ; squeeze the leaves, and bot- 
tle the liquor for use. When wanted, 
sponge the silk with it. 

2489. BLACKBERRIES are very 
beneficial in cases of dysentery. The 
berries are healthful eating. Tea made 
of the roots and leaves is goo<? , and 
syrup made from the berries excel- 
lent. 

2490. BLACKBERRY WINE. 
Gather when ripe, on a dry day. Put 
into a vessel, with the head out, and a 
tap fitted near the bottom; pour on 
them boiling water to cover them. Mash 
the berries with your hands, and let 
them stand covered till the pulp rises 
to the top and forms a crust, in three

or four days. Then draw off the fluid 
into another vessel, and to every gallon 
add one pound of sugar ; mix well, and 
put into a cask, to work for a week or 
ten days, and throw on any remaining 
lees, keeping the cask well filled, par- 
ticularly at the commencement. When 
the working has ceased, bung it down ; 
after eix to twelve months it may be 
bottled. (Sec 221.) 

2491 . BLAC KING FOR LEATHER 
SEATS, &c. Beat well the yolks of 
two eggs and the white of one ; mix 
a tal.de spoonful of gin and a tea-spoon- 
ful of sugar, thicken it with ivory black, 
add it to the eggs, and use as common 
blacking ; the seats or cushions being 
left a day or t'.vo to harden. This is 
good for dress boots and shoes. 

2492. BLEACHING STRAW 
BONNETS, &c. Wash them in pure 
water, scrubbing them wdth a brush. 
Then put them into a box in which has 
been se-fc a saucer of burning sulphur. 
Cover them up, so that the fumes may 
bleach them. 

2493. CLEANING STRAW BON- 
NETS They may be washed with 
soap and water, rinsed in clear water, 
and dried in the air. Then wash them 
over with white of egg well beaten. 
Remove the wire before washing. Old 
straw bonnets may be picked to pieoas. 
and put together for children, the head 
parts being cut out. 

2494. BIRDS, QUADRUPEDS, 
&c., FOR STUFFING. Large ani- 
mals should be caref illy skinned with 
the horns, skull, tail, hoofs, &c., entire. 
Then rub the inside of the skin thor- 
oughly with a mixture of salt, pepper, 
and alum, and hang up to dry. Large 
birds may be treated in the same way, 
but should not be put into spirits. 

2495. SMALL BIRDS maybe pre- 
served as follows : Take out the en- 
trails, open a passage to the brain, 
which should be scooped out through 
the mouth; introduce into the cavities 
of the skull and the whole body some 
of the mixture of salt, alum, and pep- 
per, putting some through the gullet 
and whole length of the neck ; then 



hang the bird in a cool, airy place first 
by the feet that the body :oay be im- 
pregnated by the salts, and afterwards 
by a thread through the under mandible 
of the bill, till it appears to be sweet ; 
then hang it in the sun, or near a fire ; 
after it is well dried, clean out what 
remains loose of the mixture, and fili 
the cavity of the body with wool, oak- 
um, or any soft substance, and pack it 
smooth in paper. 

2496. F I S H E S. Large fishes 
should be opened in the belly, the en- 
trails taken out, and the inside well 
rubbed with pepper, and staffed with 
oakum. Small fishes may be put in 
spirit, as well as reptiles, worms, and 
insects, (except butterflies and moths,) 
insects of fine colours should be pinned 
down in a box prepared for that pur- 
pose, with their wings expanded. 

2497. INSECTS FROM BIRD 
CAGES, DRAWERS, &c. To keep 
away insects from birds' eyes, suspend 
a little bag- of sulphur in the cage. 
This is said to be healthful for birds 
generally, as well as serving to keep 
away insects by which they become 
infested. 

2498. BOOTS AND SHOES should 
be cleaned frequently, whether they 
are worn or not, and should never be 
put to stand in a damp place, nor be put 
too near the fire to dry. In cleaning, 
be careful to brush the dirt from the 
seams, and not to scrape it with a knife, 
or you will cut the stitches. Let the 
hard brush do its work thoroughly well, 
and the polish will be all the brighter 
(See 70.) 

2499. BOOT TOPS. Clean boot 
tops with one ounce of white vitriol, and 
one ounce of oxalic acid, dissolved in a 
quart of warm w T ater. Apply with a 
clean sponge. Or, sour milk one pint, 
guin arabic, half an ounce, juice of 
a lemon, white of an egg, and one ounce 
of vitriol well mixed. 

2500. BOTTLES. There is no 
easier method of cleaning glass botrles 
than putting into them fine coals, and 
well shaking, either with water or not, 
hot or cold, aceor ling to the substance 



A LIAR SHOULD HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

that fouls the bottle. Charcoal left in 
a bottle or jar for a little time will take 
away disagreeable smells. 

2501 . BLOND LACE may be re- 
vived by breathing upon it, and shak* 
'ing and napping it. The use of the 
iron turns the lace yellow. 

'2502. BOARDS TO SCOUR. 
Lime, one part, sand, three parts, soft- 
soap, two parts. Lay a little on the 
boards with the scrubbing brush, and 
rub thoroughly. Rinse with clean 
water, and rub dry. This will keep 
the boards of a good colour, and will 
also keep away vermin. 

2503. BILES. These should be 
brought to a head by warm poultices 
of chamomile flowers, or boiled white 
lily root, or qpion root ; by fermenta- 
tion with hot water, or by stimulating 
plasters. When ripe, they should be 
discharged by a needle, or the lancet. 
But this should not be attempted until 
they are fully proved. Constitutional 
treatment. Peruvian bark and port 
wine, and sea-bathing are desir&ble. 
Purgatives, diuretics, &c. 

2504. DYING BONNETS Chips 
and straw bonnets or hats may be dyed 
black by boiling them three or four 
hours in a strong liquor of logwood, 
adding a little green copperas occa- 
sionally. Let the bonnets .remain in 
the liquor all night, then take out to 
dry in the air. If the black is not 
satisfactory, dye again after drying. 
Rub inside and out with a sponge 
moistened in fine oil. Then block. 

2505. BOTTLING AND FINING. 
Corks should be sound, clean, and sweet. 
Beer and porter should be allowed to 
stand in the bottles a day or two before 
corked. Jf for speedy use, wiring- is 
not necessary. Laying the bottles on 
their sides will assist the ripening for 
use. Those that are to be kept, should 
be wired, and put to stand upright in 
saw-dust. Wines should be bottled on 
the coming of spring. If not fine 
enough, draw oft' a jug and dissolve 
isinglass in it, in the proportion of half 
an ounce to ten gallons, and then pour 
back through the bung-hole. Let it 



stand a few weeks longer. Tap the 
casks above the lees. When the isin- 
glass is put into the cask, stii it round 
with a stick, taking great care not 
to touch the lees at the bottom. For 
white wine only, mix with the isin 
glass in a quarter of a pint of milk 
to each gallon of wine. White of eggs, 
beaten with some of the wine one 
white to four gallons, makes a good fining. 

2506. PRESERVED PEACHES. 
Wipe, and pick the fruit, and have read^y 
a quarter of the weight of fine sugar in 
powder. Put the fruit into an ice-pot 
that shuts very close ; throw the sugar 
over it, and then cover the fruit with 
brandy. Between the top and cover ol 
the pot put a piece of double whity- 
brown paper. Set the pot in a saucepan 
of water till the brandy be as hot as 
you can bear to put your finger into, 
but it must not boil. Put the fruit 
into a jar, and pour on the brandy. 
Cover as preserves. 

2507. BAITER PUDDING, BAKED 
OR BOILED. Six ounces fine flour, a 
little salt, and three eggs ; beat well 
with a little milk, added by degrees 
until it is the thickness of cream ; put 
into a butter-dish ; bake three-quarters 
of an hour ; or if boiled put it into a 
buttered and floured basin, tied over 
with a cloth ; boil one hour and a 
half or more. 

2508. APPLE DUMPLINGS. Paste 
the same as for apple pudding, divide 
into as many pieces as dumplings are 
required ; peel and core the apples ; roll 
out your paste large enough ; put 
in the apples ; close the dumplings, tie 
them in cloths very tight. Boil them 
one hour ; when you take them up, dip 
them quickly in cold water, and put 
them in a cup while you untie them 
they will turn out without breaking. 

2509. DRIED APPLES are pro- 
duced by taking fine apples of god 
quality, and placing them in $ very 
slow oven for several hours. Take 
them out occasionally, rub and press 
them flat. Continue until they are 
done. If they look dry, rub over them 
a little clarified sugar. 



Sii 



A HUNGRY MAN SEES FAR. 



2510. TOMATO, OR LOVE APPLE 
SAUCE. Twelve^ tomatos, ripe anc 
red ; take off the stalk ; cut in halves 
squeeze enough to get all the water 
and seeds out ; put in a stew-pan with 
ft capsicum, and two or three table- 
ipoonsful of beef gravy ; set on a slow 
stove till properly melted ; rub them 
through a tamis into a clean stew-pan, 
add a little white pepper and salt, and 
let them simmer a few minutes. The 
French cook udds an onion or eschalot, 
a clove or two, or a little tarragon vin- 
egar. 

2511. APPLE PIE. Pare, core, and 
quarter the apples ; boil the cores and 
parings in sugar and water ; strain oft' 
the liquor, adding more sugar ; grate 
the rind of a lemon over the apples, 
and squeeze the juice into the syrup ; 
mix half a dozen cloves with the" fruit, 
put in a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut ; cover with puff-paste. (See 98 ) 

2512. BARLEY WATER. Pearl 
barley, two ounces ; wash till freed from 
dust, in cold water. Boil in a quart of 
water a few minutes, strain off the 
liquor, throw it away. Then boil the 
barley in four pints and a half of water, 
until it be reduced one-half. 

2513. APPLE FRITTERS. Peel 
and core some fine pippins, and cut into 
slices. Soak them in wine, sugar, and 
nutmeg, for a few hours. Batter of four 
eggs, to a table-spoonful of rose-water, a 
table- spoonful of wine, and a table- 
Bpoonful of milk ; thicken with enough 
flour, stirred in by degrees ; mix two 
or three hours before wanted. Heat 
some butter in a frying-pan ; dip each 
slice of apple separately in the batter, 
and fry brown ; sift pounded sugar, and 
grate a nutmeg over them. 

2514. APPLE WATER. A tart 
apple well baked and mashed ; on 
which pour a pint of boiling- water. 
Beat up, cool, and strain. Add sugar 
if de3ired. Cooling drink for sick 
persons. 

2515. IRON AND STEEL GOODS 
FROM RUST. Dissolve half an ounce 
of camphor in one pound of hog's lard ; 
take off the scum ; mix as much black 



lead as win give tne mixture an iron 
colour. Iron and steel goods, rubbed 
over with this mixture, and left with it 
on twenty-four hours, and then dried 
with a linen cloth, will keep clean for 
months. Valuable articles of cutlery 
shvmld be wrapped in ZINC FOIL, or be 
kept in boxes lined with zinc. This 
is at once an easy and most effective 
method. 

2516. ARROWROOT JELLY. A 
table-spoonful of arrow-root, and cold 
water to form a paste ; add a pint ot 
boiling- water ; stir briskly, boil a few 
minutes. A little sherry and sugar 
may be added. For infants, a drop or 
two of the essence of carraway-seed or 
cinnamon is preferable. 

2517. ACCIDENTS IN CAR- 
RIAGES. It is safer* as a general 
rule, to keep your place, than to jump 
out. Getting out of a gig over the 
back, provided you can hold on a little 
while, and run, is safer than springing 
from the side. But it is best to keep 
Four place, and hold fast. In acci- 
dents people act not so much from 
reason as from excitement. But good 
rules, firmly impressed upon the mind, 
generally rise uppermost, even in the 
midst of fear. (See 398, 526, 559, 695, 
2006.) 

2518. RESTORING COLOUR TO 
SILK. When the colour has been 
:aken from silk by acids, it may be 
restored by applying to the spot a little 
mrtshorn, or salvolatile. 

2519. ALABASTER. For cleaning 
t there is nothing better than soap and 

water. Stains may be removed by 
washing with soap and water, then 
white-washing the stained part, letting 
t stand some hours, then washing oil 
;he white-wash, and rubbing- the stained 
part 

2520. BISHOP is mulled wine, 
made with Burgundy. 

2521. CARDINAL is mul!?d wine, 
made with old Rhenish wine. 

2522. POPE is mulled wine, taado 
with Tokay wine. 

2523. ALMOND CUSTARDS. 
Blanch and pound fine, with half a giK

of rose water, six ounces of sweet, and 
half an ounce of bitter almonds, boil a 
pint of milk, with a few coriander 
seeds, a little cinnamon and lemon 
peel ; sweeten it with two ounces and a 
half of sugar, rub the almonds through 
a fine sieve, with a pint of cream, strain 
the milk to the yolks of eight eggs, and 
the whites of three well beaten ; stir it 
over a fire till it is of a good thickness, 
take it oif the fire, and stir it till 
nearly cold, to prevent its curdling. 

2524. SPONGE CAKE. Take 
equal weight of egg and sugar ; half 
their weight in sifted flour ; to twelve 
eggs, add the grated rind of three 
lemons, and the juice of two. Beat the 
eggs carefully, white and yolks sepa- 
rately, before they are used. Stir the 
materials thoroughly together, and 
bake in a quiet oven. 

2525. ALMOND SPONGE CAKE is 
made by adding blanched almonds to 
the above. 

2526. BOSTON APPLE PUDDING. 
Peel and core one dozen and a half 
of good apples ; cut them small ; put 
them into a stew-pan with a little water, 
cinnamon, two cloves, and the peel of 
a lemon ; stew over a slow fire till soft ; 
sweeten with moist sugar, and pass it 
through a hair-sieve ; add the yolks of 
four eggs and one white, a quarter of a 
pound of good butter, half a nutmeg, 
the peel of a lemon grated, and the 
juice of one lemon : heat well together : 
line the inside of a pie-dish with good 
puff paste ; put in the pudding, and 
bake half an hour. 

2527. APPLES SERVED WITH 
CUSTARD. Pare and core apples ; cut 
them in pieces ; bake or stew them 
with as little water as possible; when 
completely fallen and sweetened, put 
them in a pie dish, and, when cold, 
pour over them an unboiled custard, 
and put hack into the oven till the 
custard is fixed. A Dutch oven will 
do. Equally good hot or cold. 

2528. ARSENIC may be detected by 
a solution of blue vitriol dropped into 
the suspected liquid, which will tarn 
green, if arsevac be present 

14 



2529. COPPER IN LIQUIDS may 
be detected by spirits of hartshorn, 
which turns them blue. 

2530. CLOTHES BALLS. Fullers' 
earth dried till it crumbles to powder ; 
moisten it with the juice of lemon 
and a small quantity of pearl-ash, work 
and knead carefully tog-ether till it 
forms a thick paste ; make into balls, and 
dry them in the sun. Moisten the spot 
on clothes \vith water, then rub it 
with the ball. Wash out the spot with 
pure water. 

2531. TINCTURE OF ALLSPICE. 
Bruised allspice one ounce and a half; 
brandy a pint. Steep a fortnight, oc- 
casionally shaking, then pour off the 
clear liquor. Excellent for many of 
the uses of allspice, for making a bishop, 
mulling wine, flavouring gravies, potted 
meats, &c. (Sec 2520.) 

2532. FRENCH BATTER. Two 
ounces of butter cut into bits, pour on 
it less than a quarter of a pint of water 
boiling ; when dissolved add three 
quarters of a pint of water cold, BO 
that it shall not be quite milk warm ; 
mix by degrees smoothly with twelve 
ounces of fine dry flour and a small 
pinch of salt, if the batter be for fruit 
tritters, but with more if for meat or 
vegetables. Before used, stir it into the 
whites of two eggs beaten to solid 
froth ; previously to this, add a little 
water if too thick. This is excellent 
for frying vegetables, and for fruit 
fritters. 

2533. WASHING BED FURNI- 
TURE, fec. Before putting into the 
water, see that you shake off as much 
dust as possible, or you will greatly in- 
crease your labour. Use no soda, or 
pearl-ash, or the things will lose theii 
colour. Use soft water, not hot, but 
warm. Have plenty of it. Rub with 
mottled soap. On wringing out the 
second liquor, dip each piece into cold 
hard water for finishing. Shake out 
well and dry quickly. If starch is de- 
sired, it may be stirred into the rinsing 
water. 

2534. MENDING. When you make 
a now article always save the

JAMES MONROE, CORN 1759, DTED 1831. 



Until " mending day," which may come 
sooner than expected. It will be well 
even to buy a little extra quantity for 
repairs. Read over repeatedly the 
useful hints 203. 496 to 747, 878 to 
905, 1097 to 1149. These numerous 
paragraphs contain most valuable sug- 
gestions that will be constantly useful, 
if well remembered. They should be 
read frequently for their full value to 
be secured. Let your domestics also 
read them, for nothing more conduces 
to good housekeeping than for the 
servant to understand the " system' ' 
which her mistress approves. 

2535. BED ROOMS should not be 
gcoured in the winter time, as colds 
and sickness may be produced thereby. 
Dry-scouring, upon the French plan, 
which consists of scrubbing the floors 
with dry brushes, may be resorted to, 
and will be found more effective than 
can at first be imagined. If a bed-room 
is wet scoured, a dry day should be 
chosen the windows should be opened, 
the linen removed, and a fire should 
be lit when the operation is terminated. 

2536. ALUM WHEY. A pint of 
cow's milk boiled with two drachms of 
alum, until a curd is found. Then 
strain off the liquor, and add spirit of 
nutmeg, two ounces ; syrup of cloves 
an ounce. It is used in diabetes, and 
in uterine fluxes, &c. 

2537. ANGLO- JAPANESE WORK. 
This an elegant and easy domestic 
art. Take yellow withered leaves, dis- 
solve gum, black paint, copal varnish, 
&c. Any articles may be ornamented 
with these simple materials. An old 
work-box, tea-caddy, flower-pots, fire- 
screens' screens of all descriptions, 
work-boxes, &c. Select perfect kaves, 
dry and press them between the leaves 
of books ; rub the surface of the 
article to be ornamented wvi-h fine 
sand-paper, then give it a coat of fine 
black paint, which should be procured 
mixed at a colour-shop. When dry, 
nib smooth with pumice-stone, and 

E've two other coats. Dry. Arrange 
aves in any manner and variety, ac- 
cording to taste. Gum the leaves on 



the under side, and press them upon 
their places. Then dissolve some 
isinglass in hot water and brush it over 
the work. Dry. Give three coats o 
copal varnish, allowing ample time foi 
each coat to dry. Articles thus orna 
mented last for years, and are very 
pleasing. 

2538. APPETITE. Appetite isfre 
quently lost through excessive use ol 
stimulants, food taken too hot, seden- 
tary occupation, costiveness, liver dis- 
order, and want of change of air. The 
first endeavour should be to ascertain 
and remove the cause. (See 1215. and 
]273). Change of diet, and change of 
air, will frequently be found more ben- 
eficial than medicines. 

2539. BRANDY PEACHES. Drop 
them into a weak, boiling lye, until 
the skim can be wiped off. Make a 
thin syrup to cover them, boil until 
they are soft to the finger-nail ; make 
a rich syrup, and add, after they come 
from the fire, and while hot, the same 
quantity of brandy as syrup. The fruit 
must be covered. 

2540. BASTINGS. 1, fresh butter ; 
2, clarified suet; 3, minced sweet herbs, 
butter, and claret, especially for mut- 
ton and lamb ; 4, water and salt ; 5, 
cream and melted butter, especially for 
a flayed pig ; 6, yolks of eggs, grated 
biscuit, and juice of oranges. 

2541. DREDGINGS. 1, flour mixed 
with grated bread ; 2, sweet herbs dried 
and powdered, and mixed with grated 
bread ; 3, lemon-peel dried and pound- 
ed, or orange-peel, mixed with flour; 
4, sugar finely powdered, and mixed 
with pounded cinnamon, and flour or 
gratea bread ; 5, fennel seeds, cori- 
anders, cinnamon, and sugar, finely 
beaten, and mixed with grated bread 
or flo:ir ; 6, for young- pigs, grated 
bread or flour, mixed with beaten nut- 
meg, ginger, pepper, sugar, and yolks 
of eggs ; 7, sugar, bread, and salt 
mixed. 

2542. GARNISHES. Parcley is the 
most universal garnish to all kinds of 
cold meat, poultry, fish, butter, cheese, 
and so forth. Horse - radish is th ? 



JAMES MADISON, BORN 1751, DIED 1836. 



317 



garnish for roast beef, and for fish in 
general ; for the latter, slices of lemon 
are sometimes laid alternately with 
heaps of horse-radish. 

Slices of lemon for boiled fowl, tur- 
key, and fish, and for roast veal and 
calf's head. 

Carrot in slices for boiled beef, hot 
or cold. 

Barberries fresh or preserved for 
a me. 

Red beet-root sliced for cold meat, 
boiled beef, and salt fish. 

Fried smelts as garnish for turbot. 

Fried sausages or force meat balls 
round turkey, capon, or fowl. 

Lobster coral and parsley round 
boiled fish. 

Fennel for mackerel and salmon, 
either fresh or pickled. 

Currant jelly for game, also for cus- 
tard or bread budding. 

Seville orange in slices for wild 
ducks, widgeons, teal, &c. 

Mint, either with or without parsley, 
for roast lamb, either hot or cold. 

Pickled gherkins, capers, or onions, 
for some kinds of boiled meat and 
stews. (See 3129.) 

2543. BATH BUNS. A quarter 
of a pound of flour, four yolks and 
three whites of eggs, with four spoon- 
fuls of solid fresh yeast. Beat in a 
bowl, and set before the fire to rise ; 
then rub into one pound of flour 
ten ounces of butter, put in half a 
pound of sugar, and car raway- com- 
fits ; when the eggs and yeast are 
pretty light, mix by degrees all to- 
g-ether, throw a cloth over it, and set 
before the fire to rise. Make the buns, 
and when -on the tins brush over 
with the yolk of egg and milk ; strew 
them with carraway-comfits ; bake in 
a quick oven. 

2544. FRENCH BEANS. Cut off 
the stalk- end, and strip off the strings, 
then cut them into shreds. If not 
quite fresh, have a basin of spring- 
water, with a little salt dissolved in it, 
and as the beans are cleaned and 
stringed, throw them in: put them on 
the fire in boiling water, with some 



salt in it; after they have boiled fif- 
teen or twenty minutes, take one out 
and taste it ; as soon a/5 they are tender 
take them up, throw them into a co- 
lander or sieve to drain. Send up the 
beans whole when they are very young. 
When they are very large they look 
pretty cut into lozenges. 

2545. WOW WOW SAUCE. 
Chop parsley-leaves fine ; take two cr 
three pickled cucumbers, or walnuts 
and divide into small squares, and set 
them by ready; put into a saucepan 
butter as big as an egg; when it is 
melted, stir into it a tablespoonful ot 
fine flour, and half a pint of the broth 
of the beef; add a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, one of mushroom catchup, or 
port wine, or both, and a teaspoonful of 
made mustard ; simmer together till it 
is as thick as you wish, put in the 
parsley and pickles to get warm, and 
pour it over the beef, or send it up in 
a saucetureen. This is excellent for 

STEWED Or BOILED BEEF. 

2546. ROAST BEEF BONES fur. 
nish a very relishing luncheon or sup- 
per, prepared with poached or fried 
eggs and mashed potatoes, as accom- 
paniments. Divide the bones, leaving 
good pickings of meat on each ; score 
them in squares, pour a little melted 
butter on them, and sprinkle them 
with pepper and salt ; put them on a 
dish ; set them in a Dutch-oven for 
half or tln'ee-quarters of an hour, ac- 
cording to the thickness of the meat ; 
keep turning them till they are quite 
hot and brown ; or broil them on the 
gridiron. Brown them, but don't bum 
them. Serve with Grill sauce. 

2547. GRILL SAUCE. To a quar- 
ter of a pint of gravy add half an ounce 
of butter and a dessertspoonful of 
flour, well nibbed together, the same 
of mushroom or walnut catchup, a 
teaspoonful of lemon-juice, half a tea- 
spoonful of made mustard, and oi 
minced capers, a little black pepper, a 
littlo rind of lemon, grated very thin, a 
salt-spoonful of essence of anchovies, 
and a little eschalot wine, or a very 
small piece of minced eschalot, and s 



818 



COMMODORE MACDONOUOH, BORN 



DIED 1825. 



little Chili vinegar, or a few grains of 
raycimo ; simmer together for a few 
minutes ; pour a little of it over the 
Grill, and send up the rest in a sauce- 
tureen. 

2545. BEEF BROTH may be made 
by adding vegetables to (2479) Essence 
of beef or you may wash a leg or 
phin ;.f beef, crack the bone well, (de- 
sire the butcher to do it for you,) add 
any trimmings of meat, game, or poul- 
try, heads, necks, gizzards, feet, &c., 
cover them with cold water, stir it 
up well from the bottom, and the mo- 
ment it begins to simmer, skim it care- 
fully. Your broth must be perfectly 
clear and limpid, on this depends the 
goodness of the soups, sauces, and 
gravies, of which it is the basis. Add 
some cold water to make the remain- 
ing scum rise, and skim it again. When 
the scum has done rising, and the sur- 
face of the broth is quite clear, put in 
one moderate-sized carrot, a head of 
celery, two turnips and two onions 
it should not have any taste of sweet 
herbs, spice, or g-arlic, &c. : either of 
these flavours can easily be added after, 
if desired cover it close, set it by the 
side of the fire, and let it simmer very 
gently (so as not to waste the broth) 
for four or five hours or more, accord- 
ing- to the weight of the meat: strain 
it through a sieve into a clean and dry 
stone pan. and set it into the coldest 
place you have, if for after use> 

2549. BEEF GLAZE, OR PORT- 
ABLE SOUP is simply the essence of 
beef (2479) condensed by evaporation. 
It may be put into pots, like potted 
meats, or into skins, as sausages, and 
will keep for many months. If further 
dried in cakes or lozenges, by being 
laid on pans or dishes, and, frequently 
turned, it will keep for years, and sup- 
ply soup at any moment. 

2550. STEWED BRISKET 
BEEF. Stew in sufficient water to 
cover the meat ; when tender, take out 
the bones, and skim off the fat ; add to 
the gravy, when strained, a glass of 
wine and a little spice tied up in a 
muslin bag. (This may be omitted.) 



Have ready either mushrooms, truf- 
fles, or vegetables boiled, and cut ;uto 
shapes. Lay them on and round th* 
beef; reduce part of the gravy to glaze, 
lay it on the top, and pour the remain 
der into the dish. 

2551. BEEF BRISKET may be 
baked, the bones being removed, and 
the holes being filled with oysters, fat 
bacon, parsley, or all three in separate 
holes, these stuffings being chopped and 
seasoned to taste. Dredge it well with 
flour, pour upon it half a pint of broth, 
bake three hours, skim off the fat, 
strain the gravy over the meat, and 
garnish with cut pickles. 

2552. BAKING. In addition to the 
remarks (239 and 1972), we transcribe 
the following remarks from Dr. Kitch- 
ener's excellent " Cook's Oracle " : 

" BAKING is one of the cheapest arid 
most convenient ways of dressing a 
dinner in small families; and, I may 
say, that the oven is often the only 
kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to 
enjoy a joint of meat at home with his 
family. 

" I don't mean to deny the superior 
excellence of roasting to baking ; but 
some joints, when baked, so nearly ap- 
proach to the same when roasted, that 
I have known them to be carried to the 
table, and eaten as such with great 
satisfaction. 

" LEGS and LOINS of PORK, LEGS 
of MUTTON, FILLETS of VEAL, and 
many other joints, will bake to great 
advantage, if the meat be good ; I mean 
well-fed rather inclined to be fat; if 
the meat be poor, no baker can give 
satisfaction. 

" When baking a joint of meat, be- 
fore it has been half baked, I have seen 
it start from the bone, and shrivel up in 
a manner scarcely to be believed. 

" Besides those joints above mention- 
ed, I shall enumerate a few baked 
dishes which I can particularly recom- 
mend : 

" A PIG, when sent to the baker 
prepared for baking, should have its 
ears and tail covered with buttered pa- 
per properly fastened on, and a bit 01 



COMMODORE BAINBRIDGE, BORX 1774, DIED 1833. 



319 



butter tied up in a piece of linen to 
baste the back with, otherwise it will 
oe apt to blister : with a proper share 
of attention from the baker, I consider 
this way equal to a roasted one. 

" A GOOSE prepare the same as for 
roasting, taking care to have it on a 
stand, and when half done to turn the 
other side upwards. A DUCK the same. 

"A BUTTOCK OF BEEF ; the following 
way is particularly fine: After it has been 
in ealt about a week, to be well wash- 
ed, and put into a brown earthen pan, 
with a pint of water; cover the pan 
tight over with two or three thicknesses 
of cap or foolscap paper never cover 
anything that is to be baked with brown 
paper, the pitch and tar which are in 
brown paper will give the meat a 
smoky, bad taste give it four or five 
hours in a moderately-heated oven. 

" A HAM (if not too old) put in soak 
for an hour, taken out and wiped, a 
crust made sufficient to cover it all 
over, and baked in a moderately-heated 
oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer 
flavor than a boiled one. 

" I have been in the habit of baking 
small OAFISH, and MACKEREL, with 
a dj'.it ot flour, and some bits of butter 
put on them. EELS, when large are 
stuffed. HERRINGS are done in a brown 
pan, with vinegar and a little spice, and 
tied over with paper. 

" A RABBIT, prepare the same as 
for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, 
and a little drop of milk put into the 
dish, and basted several times, will be 
found nearly equal to roasting ; or cut 
it up, season it properly, put it into a 
jar or pan, and cover it over, and bake 
it in a moderate oven for about three 
hours. 

" In the same manner I have been in 
the habit of baking LEGS and SHINS of 
BEEF, Ox CHEEKS, &c., prepared with 
a seasoning of onions, turnips, &c. : 
they will take about four hours ; let 
them stand till cold, to skim off the fat ; 
then warm it up all together, or in part, 
us you may want. 

" All these I have beer, hi the habit 
of baking for the first families. 



" The time each of the above articles 
should take depends much upon th< 
state of the oven, and I consider the 
baker a sufficient judge ; if they are 
sent to him in time, he must bo very 
neglectful if they are not ready at the 
time they are ordered." 

2553. BEEF, COLD, BOILED. The 
same as roast beef bones (2546). The 
meat should have been under-done in 
the first instance. Capital relish with 
the accessories. 

2554. BEEF (RUMP) STEAK AND 
ONION SAUCE. Peel and slice two 
large onions, put them into a quart 
stew-pan, with two table-spoonfuls of 
water ; cover the pan close, and set on 
a slow fire till the water has boiled 
away, and the onions have got a little 
browned ; then add half a pint of good 
broth, and boil the onions till they are 
tender ; strain the broth from them, 
and chop them very fine, and season it 
with mushroom catsup, pepper, and 
salt ; put the onion into it, and let it 
boil gently for five minutes, pour it 
into the dish, and lay over it a broiled 
rump steak. If instead of broth you use 
good beef gravy, it will be superlative. 

2555. ROUND OF SALT BEEF. 
Skewer it tight and round, and tie a 
fillet of broad tape round it. Put it 
into plenty of cold water, and carefully 
skim the skum ; let it boil till all the 
scum is removed, and then put the 
boiler on one side of the fire, to keep 
simmering slowly till it is done. Half 
a round may be boiled for a sm&il fam- 
ily. When you take it up, wash the 
scum off with a paste- brush garnish 
with carrots and turnips. 

2556. H. BONE OF BEEF. Mn- 
age the same as the round. The soft, 
marrow-like fat which lies on the back 
is best when hot, and the hard fat of 
the upper corner is best cold. 

2557. HASHED MUTTON OK 
BEEF. Take the meat, slice small, 
trim off the brown edges, and stew 
down the trimmings with the bonea 
well broken, an onion, a bunch of 
thyme and parsley, a carrot cut in-to 
slices, a few peppercorns, cloves, ealt 



820

and a pint and a half of water or stock. 
Wheu this is reduced to little more 
than three quarters of a pint, strain it, 
clear it from the fat, thicken It with a 
large dessert-spoonful of flour, or 
arrow-root, add salt and pepper, hoil 
the whole for a few minutes, then lay 
in the meat and heat it well. Boiled 
potatoes are sometimes sliced hot into 
the hash. 

2558. ORNAMENTED LEATHER 
WORK. An excellent imitation of 
carved oak, suitable for frames, boxes, 
rases, and ornaments in endless variety, 
may be made of a description of leather 
called basil. The art consists in simply 
cutting out this material in imitation 
of natural objects, and in impressing 
upon it by simple tools, either with or 
without the aid of heat, such marks 
and characteristics as are necessary to 
the imitation. The rules given with 
regard to the imitation of leaves and 
flowers (1887) apply to Ornamental 
Leaf her Work. Begin with a simple 
object, and proceed by degrees to those 
that are more complicated. Cut out 
an ivy or an oak leaf, and impress the 
veins upon it ; then arrange these in 
groups, and affix them to frames, or 
otherwise. The tools required are 
ivory or steel points of various sizes, 
punches, and tin-shapes, such as are 
used for confectionery. The points 
may be made out of the handles of old 
tooth-brvsb.es. Before cutting out the 
leaves the leather should be well 
soaked in water, until it is quite pli- 
able. When dry it will retain the 
artistic shape. Leaves and stems are 
fastened together by means of liquid 
glue, and varnished with any of the dry- 
toe varnishes, or with sealing-wax dis- 
solved to a suitable-consistency in spirits 
of wine Wire, cork,guttapercha, bits of 
etems of trees, &c., may severally be used 
to aid in the formation of groups of buds, 
flowers, seed vessels, &c. Tome beau- 
tiful specimens may be seen in the 
Crystal Palace. 

2559. BREWING. The best time 
of the year for brewing is the autumn. 
The spring is also suitable but !f? so. 



It is a great object to secure a moderate 
temperature for tho cooling of the 
worts, and to insure gradual fermenta 
tion. The brewing of home made 
drinks has to a very great extent gone 
out ot late years, even in country 
places; and therefore we have little 
Inducement to occupy our limited 
space with the lengthy directions ne- 
cessary to constitute a practical essay 
upon brewing. To those, however, 
who wish to enter upon the practice, 
without any previous knowledge, wo 
would advise their calling in the aid of 
some one practically acquainted with 
the process for the first operation. By 
so doing they will save a great deal of 
trouble, disappointment and expense. 
In all places, town or country, there 
are persons who have worked in brew- 
ing establishments, or in gentlemen's 
families, where they have superintended 
the operations of the brew-house, and 
the aid of such persons would be valu- 
able. With such assistance the follow- 
ing receipts will be of importance, since 
many who are able to go through the 
manipulations of brewing are unaware 
of the proper proportions to employ. 

2560. ALE. Take three bushels ot 
malt, three pounds of hops, fifty-two 
gallons of water for two workings. 

Or Malt, two bushels and a half ; 
sugar, three pounds; hops, three 
pounds ; coriander seeds, one ounce ; 
capsicum, a drachm. Thirty-six gal- 
lons. This gives a pleasant ale, with a 
good body. 

256?. AMBER ALE. Three bushels 
of amber malt, three-quarters of a 
bushel of pale amber malt, two pounds 
of hops, a table-spoonful of salt. Three 
mashes, forty to fifty gallons. Skiiu 
and fice with isinglass. 

2562. BURTON. One quarter of pale 
malt, eight pounds and a half of pale 
hops; mash three times. Work the 
first mash at 170, second at 176, 
third at 150. Boil the first wort by 
itself; when boiling add three pounds 
of honey, a pound and a half of cori- 
ander seeds, one ounce of salt. Mix 
the worts when boiled, cool to 01, set 



ALL FAILS THAT FOOLS THINK.

to work with a piutand a half of yeast. 
As soon as the gyle gets yeasty, skim 
the head half off ; rouse the rest with 
another pint and a half of yeast, three- 
quarters of an ounce of bay salt, and a 
quarter of a pound of malt or bean 
flour. This makes a hogshead. 

2563. EDINBURGH. Mash two barrels 
per quarter, at 183 ; mash three 
quarters of an hour , let it stand one 
hour, and allow half an hour to run 
off. Or, mash one barrel per quarter, at 
190 ; mash three-quarters of an hour, 
let it stand three-quarters of an hour, 
and tap. 

2564. PORTER. Brown, amber and 
pale malt, in equal quantities ; turn 
them into the mash -tub. Turn on the 
first liquor at 165 ; mash one hour, then 
coat the whole with dry malt. In one 
hour set the tap. Mix ten pounds of 
brown hops to a quarter of malt, half 
old, half new; boil the first wort briskly 
with the hops for three-quarters of 
an hour ; after putting into the copper 
one pound and a half of sugar, and one 
pound and a half of extract of liq- 
uorice to the barrel, turn it into 
coolers, rousing the wort the while. 
Turn on the second liquor at 174, set 
tap again in an hour. The second 
wort having run off, turn on again at 
145 ; mash an hour, and stand an 
hour ; boil the second wort with the 
same hops for an hour. Turn into the 
coolers, and let into the tub at 64, 
mixing the yeast as it comes down. 
Cleanse the second day at 80, pre- 
viously adding a mixture of flour and 
salt, and rousing well. 

2565. BRASSES, BRITANNIA 
METALS, TINS, COPPERS, &c., arc 
cleaned with a mixture of rotten-stone, 
soft-soap, and oil of turpentine, mixed 
to the consistency of stiff putty. The 
stone should, be powdered very fine 
and sifted ; and a quantity of the mix- 
ture may be made sufficient to last for 
along while. The articles should first 
Ke \vashed with hot water, to remove 
grease. Then a little of the above 
mixture mixed with water, should be 
ve r the metal : then rub off 



briskly, with dry clean rag or leather 
and a beautiful polish will be ob- 
tained. 

2566. BREATH TAINTED BY 
ONIONS. Leaves of parsley, eaten 
with vinegar, will prevent the disagree- 
able consequences of eating onions. 

2567. BUNIONS may be checked in 
their early development by binding the 
joint with adhesive plaster, and keep 
ing it on as long as any uneasiness is 
felt. The bandaging should be perfect, 
and it might be well to extend it v ound 
the foot. An inflamed bunion should 
be poulticed, and larger shoes be worn. 
Iodine, twelve grains ; lard or sperma- 
ceti ointment, half an ounce, makes a 
capital ointment for bunions. It should 
be rubbed on gently twice or thrice 
a-day. (Sec 178,1297.) 

2568. SOFT CORNS may be relieved 
by placing a small piece of lint between 
the toes ; or be rubbed occasionally 
with sweet oil. 

2569. BAD BUTTER may be im- 
proved greatly by dissolving it thor- 
oughly in hot water ; let it cool, then 
skim it off, and churn again, adding a 
little good salt and sugar. A small 
quantity can be tried and approved 
before doing a larger one. The water 
should be merely hot enough to melt 
the butter or it will become oily. 

2570. GILT FRAMES may be pro- 
tected from flies and dust by oiled tar- 
latan pinned over them. Tarlatan al- 
ready prepared, may be purchased at 
the upholsterers' . If it cannot be pro- 
cured, it is easily made by brushing 
boiled oil over cheap tarlatan. It is 
an excellent material for keeping 
dust from books, vases, wood-work, and 
every description of household orna- 
ment. 

2571. SALT BUTTER may be 
freshened by churning it with new 
milk in the proporion of a pound of 
butter to a quart of milk. Treat th* 
butter in all respects in churning as 
fresh. Cheap earthenware churns for 
domestic use may be had at any hard- 
ware shop. 

2572. CABBAGE-WATER should 



S22 



THREE LITTLE WORDS YOU OFTEN SEK 



be thrown away immediately it is done 
with, and clean water thrown after it, or 
it will give rise to unpleasant smells. 
A little charcoal thrown with clear 
water into a sink will disinfect and de- 
odorize it. 

2573. CALVES' FEET JELLY. 
It is better to buy the feet of the 
butcher, than at the tripe shop ready 
boiled, because the best portion of the 
V'lly has been extracted. Slit them in 
two, and take every particle of fat from 
the claws ; wash well in warm water, 
put them in a large stew-pan, and 
cover with water ; skim well and let 
boil gently six or seven hours, until re- 
duced to about two quarts, then strain 
and skim off any oily substance on the 
surface. It is best to boil the feet the 
day before making the jelly, as, when 
the liquor is cold, the oily part being 
at the top, and the other being firm, 
with pieces of kitchen paper applied to 
it, you may remove every particle of 
the oily substance without wasting the 
liquor. Put the liquor in a stew-pan 
to melt with a pound of lump sugar, 
the peel of two, and the juice of six 
lemons, six whites and shells of eggs 
beat together, and a bottle of sherry 
or Madeira ; whisk the whole together 
until it re on the boil, then put it by 
the side of the stove, and let it simmer 
A quarter of an hour ; strain it through 
a jelly-bag; what is strained first must 
be poured into the bag again,, until it 
is as bright and clear as rock water ; 
then put the jelly in moulds to be cold 
nnd firm; if the weather is too warm, 
it requires some ice. When it is wished 
to be very stiff, half an ounce of isin- 
glass may be added when the wine is 
put in. It may be flavoured by the juice 
of various fruits and spices, &c., and 
coloured with saffron, cochineal red 
beet juice, spinach juice, claret &c., and 
is sometimes made with cherry brandy, 
red noyeau. curagoa, or essence of punch. 

2574. OX-HEEL JELLY is made 
in the same manner. 

2575. LAMP WICKS. Old cotton 
stockings may be made into lamp wicks, 
and will answer very well 



2576. BEAT A CARPET on the 

wrong side first ; and then more gently 
ou the right side. Beware of using 
sticks with sharp points, which may 
tear the carpet. 

2577. CLEANING CARPETS. 
Take a pail of cold water, and add to 
it three gills of ox-gall. Rub it into 
the carpet with a soft brush. It will 
raise a latlier ; which must be washed 
off with clear cold water. Rub dry 
with a clean cloth. In nailing down a 
carpet after the floor has been washed, 
be certain that the floor is quite dry, 
or the nails will rust and injure the 
carpet. Fullers' earth is used for 
cleaning carpets, and weak solutions of 
alum or soda are used for reviving the 
colours. The crumb of a hot wheateu 
loaf rubbed over a carpet has been 
found effective. 

2578. SWEETENING CASKS. 
Half a pint of vitriol mixed with a 
quart of water, and the mixture poured 
into the barrel, and roll about ; next 
day add one pound of chalk, and roll 
again. Bung- down for three or four 
days, then rinse well with hot water. 

2579 CAUTIONS IN VISITING 
THE SICK. Do not visit the sick 
when you are fatigued, or when in a 
state of perspiration, or with the 
stomach empty for in such conditions 
you are liable to take the infection. 
When the disease is very contagious, 
take the side of the patient which is 
near to the window. Do not enter the 
room the first thing in the morning 
before it has been aired ; and when 
you come away, take some food, change 
your clothing immediately, and expose 
the latter to the air for some days. 
Tobacco-smoke is a preventive of 
malaria. 

2580. CHAMOMILE FLOWERS 
should be gathered on a fine day, and 
dried upon a tray placed in the suit, 
all herbs should be treated in the same 
manner. 

2581. CHAMOMILE TEA. One 
ounce of the flowers to a quart of water 
boiling. Simmer fifteen miuutee and 
strain, Emetic, when token 



ARE ARTICLES A, AN, AND THE. 



tonic, when cold. Dose, a wine glass- 
ful to a breakfast-cup. 

258s ORANGE-PEEL, dried, 
added to chamomile flowers in the pro- 
portion of half the quantity of the 
flowers, improves the tonic. 

2583. DESSERT CHESTNUTS. 
Roast them well, take oft' the husks, 
dissolve four ounces of lump sugar in 
a wine-glass of water, then add the 
juice of a lemon. Put the chesnuts 
into this liquor, and stew them over a 
slow fire for ten minutes; add sufficient 
orange-flower water (If approved) to 
flavour the syrup ; grate lump sugar 
over them, and serve up quite hot. 

2584. CARVING. CEREMONIES 
OF THE TABLE, &c. A dinner-table 
should be well laid, well lighted, and 
always aftbrd a little spare room. It 
is better to invite one friend less in 
number, than to destroy the comfort 
of the whole party. 

2585. THE LAYING OUT OF A TABLE 
must greatly depend upon the nature 
of the dinner or supper, the taste of 
the host, the description of the com- 

ry, and the appliances possessed, 
will be useless, therefore, to lay 
down specific rulec. The whiteness of 
the table-cloth, the clearness of glass, 
the polish of plate, and the judicious 
distribution of ornamental groups of 
fruits and flowers, are matters deserv- 
ing the utmost attention (See 3122.) 

2586. A crowded table may be great- 
ly relieved by a SIDE-BOARD close at 
hand, upon which may be placed many 
things incidental to the successive 
courses, until they are required. 

2587. At large dinner-parties, where 
there are several courses, it is well to 
have the BILL OF FARE neatly inscribed 
upon small tablets, and distributed 
nbout the table, that the diners may 
know what there is to come. 

2588. NAPKINS should be folded 
iieatly. The French method, which is 
very easy, of folding the napkin like a 
feii, placing it in a glass, and spreading 
<>ut the upper part, is very pleasing. 
But the English method of folding 'it 
like, i slipper, and placing the bread I 

14* 



inside of it, is convenient as well aa 
neat. (See 3137.) 

2589. BREAD should be cut into 
thick squares, the last thing after the 
table is laid. If cut too early it be- 
comes dry. A tray should be provided 
in which there should be a further 
supply of bread, new, stale, and brown. 
For cheese, pulled bread should be pro- 
vided. (2647.) 

2590. CARVING-KNIVES should " be 
put in edge " before the dinner coin 
mences, for nothing irritates a good 
carver, or perplexes a bad one, more 
than a knife which refuses to perform 
its offic"e ; and there is nothing more 
annoying to the company than to see 
the carving-knife dancing to and fro 
over the steel, while the dinner is 
getting cold, and their appetites are 
being exhausted by delay. 

2591. JOINTS that require carving 
should be set upon dishes sufficiently 
large. The space of the table may be 
economized by setting upon small 
dishes those thing* that do not require 
carving. 

2592. However closely the diners 
are compelled to eit together, THE 

CARVER SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF 
RO(|W. 

2593. If the table is very crowded, 
the VEGETABLES may be placed upon 
the side-board, and handed round by 
the waiters. 

2594. It would save a great deal of 
time, and much disappointment, if 
GEESE, TURKEYS, POULTRY, SUCK- 
ING-PIGS, ETC., WERE CARVED BE- 
FORE BEING SENT TO TABLE; es- 
pecially in those cftses where the 
whole or the principal part of such 
dishes are likely to be consumed. 

2595. It is best for THE CARTER to 
supply the plates, and let the waiter 
hand them round, instead of putting 
the question to each guest us to which 
part he prefers, and then striving to 
serve him with it, to the prejudice ol 
others present. 

2596. LADIES should be assisted bo- 
fore gentlemen. 

2597. WAITKRS should present dish<* 



32-i 



A NOUN s THK XAMK or ANY THING, 



on the left hand ; so that the diner 
may assist himself witti his right. 

2598. WINE should be taken after 
the first course ; and it will be found 
more convenient to let the waiter serve 
it, than to hand the decanters round, 
or to allow the guests to fill for them- 
selves. 

2599. WAITERS should be instructed 
;o remove whatever articles upon the 
table are thrown into disuse by the 
progress of the dinner, as sooa a* they 
ire at liberty. 

2600. FINGER-GLASSES, or glass or 
olated bowls, filled with rose or orange- 
A-nter, slightly warm in winter, or 
ced in summer, should be handed 
ound. 

2601. WHEN THE DESSERT is served, 
i *\e wine should be set upon the table, 
hi-d the decanters passed round by the 
c>jnpany. (See 3373.) 

^602. FRIED FISH should be divided 
ink suitable slices, before the fire, as 
BOO, as it leaves the frying-pan. 
260.' TRUSSING AND CARVING. 

2604. POULTRY AND GAME. 
26 '5. Observations on Trussing. 
Although in New York the various ar- 
ticles ,re trussed by the poulterer from 
whom vhey are purchased, yet it fcap- 
pene that presents from the country 
are sometimes spoiled for want of 
a knowloOfe^ of the following rules, 
both on tLt) part of the mistress and 
cook: 

2606. All poultry should be well 
picked, every plug, or stub, removed, 
and the bird carefully and nicely singed 
with white paper. 1 n drawing poultry, 
or game, care should be taken not to 
break the gall-bladder as it would 
spoil the flavour of the bird by impart- 
ing a bitter taste to it, that no washing 
or any process could remove nor the 
put joining the giczard, otherwise the 
inside would be gritty. 

2607. Observations on Carving. The 
carving-knife for poultry and game is 
smaller and lighter than that for meat ; 
the point is more peaked, and the handle 
longer. 

2608. In cutting up wxJd-ittd, duck, 



goose, or turkey, more prime pieeei 
may be obtained by carving slices from 
pinion to pinion without making wing-s. 
which is a material advantage in dis- 
tributicg the bird when the party i* 
large. 
2609. DIRECTIONS FOB CARV 

JNG. FISH. 

2610. As the manner in which meat, 
and other provisions, are carved, makes 
a material difference in the consump- 
tion and comfort of a family, it becomca 
highly important to those who study 
economy and good order in their do- 
mestic arrangements, to practice the 
art. 

2611. We therefore recommend 
them to study the rules we purpose 
laying down, and which we commence 
with directions for carving fish. 

2612. It must be remembered that 
in carving more depends upon skill 
than on strength; that the carving- 
knife should be light, and of moderate 
size, with a keen edge; and that the 
dish should be so placed as to give the 
operator complete command over the 
joint. 

2613. FISH is served with a fish- 
slice, or the new fish-knife and fork, 
and requires very little carving, care 
being required, however, not to break 
the flakes, which from their size add 
much to the beauty of cod and salmon. 
Serve part of the roe, milt, or liver, to 
each person. The heads of cod and 
salmon, sounds of cod, are likewise 
considered delicacies. 

2614. SADDLE or MUTTON. Cut 
thin slices parallel with the back-bone ; 
or slice it obliquely from the bone to 
the edge. 

2615. SADDLES OF PORK OR LAMB 
are carved in the same manner. 

2616. HAUNCH OF MUTTON OR VEN- 
ISON. Make an incision right across 
the knuckle-end, right into the bone, 
and eet free the gravy. Then cut 
thin slices the whole length of the 
haunch. Serve pieces of fat with 
slices of lean. 

2617. RUMP OF SIRLOIN on BEEF 
The, undercut, called " the fillet ' i* 



SCHOOL OR GARDEN, HOOP OR SWING. 



325 



exceedingly tender, and it is usual to 
turn the joint and serve the fillet first, 
reserving the meat on the upper part 
to serve cold. From the upper part 
the slices maybe cut either lengthways 
or crossways, at option. 

2618. RIBS OK BEEF are carved in 
the same way as the sirloin ; hut there 
is no fillet. 

2619. ROUND OF BEEF. First cut 
away the irregular outside pieces, to 
obtain a good surface, and then serve 
thin and broad slices. Serve bits of 
the udder fat with the lean. 

2620. BRISKET OP BEEF. Cut off the 
outside, and then serve long slices, cut 
the whole length of the bones. 

2621. SUOULDEU OF MUTTON. Make 
a cross incision on the fore-part of the 
shoulder, and serve slices from both 
sides of the incision: then cut slices 
lengthways along the shoulder-blade. 
Cut fat slices from the round corner. 

2622. LEG OF MUTTON. Make an in- 
cision across the centre, and serve 
from the knuckle-side, or the opposite, 
according to choice. The knuckle-side 
will be generally found well done, and 
the opposite side under-done, for those 
who prefer it. 

2623. LOIN OF MUTTON. Cut down 
between the bones, into chops. 

2624. QUARTER OF LAMB. Lay the 
knife flat, and cut off the shoulder. 
The proper point for incision will be 
indicated by the position of the shoul- 
der. A little lemon-juice may be 
squeezed over the divided part, and a 
little cayenne pepper, and the shoulder 
transferred to another dish, for the op- 
posite end of the table. Next, separate 
the BRISKET, or short bones, by cutting 
lengthways along the breast. Then 
serve from either part as desired. 

2625. LOIN OF VEAL may be cut across 
through the thick part ; or slices may 
be taken ; -> direction of the bones. 
Serve pieced of kidney and fat with 
?.'ich plate. 

2626. FILLET OF VEAL is carved as 
a round of beef (2619). The browned 
bits of the outside are esteemed, and 
shouW b shared among the company, 



with bits of fat and of force meat from 
the centre. 

2627. BREAST OF VEAL should be 
divided by cutting the BRISKET, or soft 
bones, the same as the brisket of lamb. 
When the sweetbread comes to table 
with the breast, a small piece should 
be served on each plate. 

2628. SUCKING- PIG should be sent 
to table in two halves, the head divid- 
ed, and one half laid at each end of the 
dish. The shoulders and legs should 
be taken off by the obvious method of 
laying the knife under them, and lift- 
ing the joint out. They may be served 
whole, or divided. The ribs are easily 
divided, and are considered choice. 

2629. TONGUES are cut across, in 
thin slices. 

2630. CALVES' HEADS are carved 
across the cheek, and pieces taken 
from any part that is come-at-able. 
The tongue and brain-sauce are served 
separate. 

2631. KNUCKLE OF VEAL is carved 
by cutting off the outside pieces, and 
then obtaining good slices, and appor- 
tioning the fat to the lean, adding bits 
of the sinew that lie around the joint. 

2632. LEG OF PORK is carved as a 
ham, but in thicker slices: when stuff- 
ed, the stuffing must be sought for un- 
der the skin at the large end. 

2633. LOIN OF PORK is carved the 
same as a loin of mutton. 

2634. SPARE-RIB OF PORK is carved 
by separating the chops, which should 
previously have been jointed. Cut as 
tar as the joint, then return the knife 
to the point of the bones, and press 
over to disclose the joint, which may 
then be relieved with the point of the 
knife. 

2635. HAMS are cut in very vhin 
slices from the knuckle to the blade. 

2636. PHEASANTS. Carve tho 
breast in slices. Then take off the 
leu's >ind wings as a fowl. 

2637. FOWLS. Fix the i<>rk fine- 
ly into the breast, then slip the knife 
under the legs, and lay it over and dis- 
joint ; then the wings in the same 
manner. Do the same on both side*

AN ADJECTIVE TKLLS THE KIXD OF XOUK, 



The smaller bones require a little prac- 
tice, and it would be well to watch the 
operations of a good carver. When 
the merry -thought has been removed, 
which it may be by slipping the knife 
through at the point of the breast, and 
the neck-bones drawn out, the trunk 
may be turned over, and the knife 
thrust through the back bone. 

Jt>;)3. PATRIDGES are best carved 
by cutting off the breast, and then 
dividing it. But for more economical 
carving, the wings may be cut with a 
small breast slice attached. 

2639. WOODCOCKS may be cut right 
through the centre, from head to tail. 
Serve with it a piece of the toast upon 
which it comes to table. 

2640. PIGEONS may be carved as 
woodcocks, or as partridges. 

2641. SNIPES the same as wood- 
cocks. 

2642. TURKEY. Cut slices each side 
of the breast down to the ribs ; the 
legs may then be removed, and the 
thighs divided from the drum-sticks, 
which are very tough ; but the pinions 
of the wing are very good, and the 
white part of the wing is preferred by 
many to the breast. The stuffing is 
usually put in the breast ; but when 
truffles, mushrooms, or oysters are put 
into the body, an opening must be made 
into it by cutting through the apron. 

2643. GOOSED The apron must be 
cut off in a circular direction, when a 
glass of port w r ine, mixed with a tea- 
epoonful of mustard, may be poured 
into the body or not. Some of the 
stuffing should then be drawn out, and 
the neck of the goose being turned a 
little towards the carver, the flesh of 
the breast should be sliced on either 
side of the bone. The wings may then 
be taken off, then the legs. The other 
parts are carved the same as a fowl. 

2644 r PUCKS may be carved, when 
large, the anie as geese ; but when 
young, like cmckeps. The thigh joints, 
however, lie much closer into the 
trunk than those of fowls. 

2645. HARKS should be placed with 
their heads to the left of the carver. 



Slices may be taken down the whole 
length of the back; the legs, which, 
next to the back, are considered the 
best eating, may then be taken off, and 
the flesh divided from or served upon 
them, after the small bones have been 
parted from the thighs. The shoul- 
ders, which are not much esteemed, 
though sometimes liked by sportsmen, 
may be taken off by passing the knife 
between the joint and the trunk. When 
a hare is young, the back is sometimes 
divided at the joints into three or four 
parts, after being freed from the ribe 
and under-skin. 

2646. Remarks. Sufficient general 
instructions are here given to enable 
the carver, by observation and practice, 
to acquit himself well. The art oi 
carving does not consist merely in dis- 
secting- the joints sent to table, but in 
the judicious and economical distribu- 
tion of them, and the grace and neat- 
ness with which this distribution is 
effected. Every dish should be sent to 
table properly garnished (2542), and 
the carver should preserve the neat- 
ness of the arrangement as much as 
possible. 

2647. PULLED BREAD. Take 
from the oven an ordinary loaf when 
it is about half baked, and with the 
fingers, while the bread is yet hot, dex- 
terously pull the half-set dough into 
pieces of irregular shape, about the 
size of an egg. Don't attempt to 
smooth or flatten them the rougher 
their shapes the better. Set upon tine, 
place in a very slow oven, and bake to 
a rich brown. This forms a deliciousl> 
crisp crust for cheese. If you do not 
bake at home, your baker will prepare 
it for you, if ordered. Pulled bread 
may be made in the revolving ovens 
(1986.) It is very nice with wine in- 
stead of biscuits. 

2648. YEAST. The following has 
been used and approved through 36 
years. For a stone of flour: into two 
quarts of water put a quarter of ac 
ounce of hops, two potatoes sliced, 
tablespoonful of malt, or sugar ; bo : J 
twenty minutes train through a

let the liquor stand until milk-warm, 
then add a little German yeast, for a 
first quickening ; afterwards some of 
this yeast will do. Let it stand in a 
large jar or jug until sufficient 1 '? risen. 
First put into an earthen bottle a part 
of the yeast for a future quickening; 
let it stand in a cool place until wanted 
for a fresh making. Any plain cook 
or housewife can easily make thisyeust. 
Put the yeast to half or more of the 
Hour, and two quarts of warm water ; 
stir well ; let it stand and rise ; knead 
up with the rest of the flour, put it 
into or upon tins, let it stand to rise, 
bake, and you will have good bread. 

2649. RYE AND WHEAT FLOUR, 
half and half, makes excellent house- 
hold bread. 

2650. DOGS. The best way to keep 
a dog healthy is to let him have plenty 
of exercise, and not to over-feed him. 
Let them at all times have a plentiful 
supply of clean water, and encourage 
them to take to swimming, as it assists 
their cleanliness.. When you wash 
them do not use a particle of soap, or 
you will prevent their licking them- 
selves, arid they may become habitually 
dirty. Properly treated, dogs should 
be fed only once a day. Meat boiled 
for dogs, and the liquor in which it is 
boiled thickened with barley meal, or 
oatmeal, forms capital food. The dis- 
temper is liable to attack dogs from 
four months to four years old. It 
prevails most in spring and autumn. 
The disease is known by dulness of 
the eye, husky cough, shivering, loss 
of appetite and spirits, and fits. When 
fits occur, the dog will most likely die, 
unless a veterinary surgeon is called in. 
During the distemper, dogs should be 
allowed to run on the grass ; their diet 
should be spare ; and a little sulphur 
be placed in their water. Chemists 
who dispense cattle medicines can 
generally advise with sufficient safety 
upon the diseases of dogs, and it is 
best for unskilful persons to abstain 
from physicking them. Hydrophobia 
\ the most dreadfu" of all diseases. 
The first symptoms ure attended by 



thirst, fever, and languor. The dog 
starts convulsively in his sleep, and 
when awake, though restless, is 'lan- 
guid. When a dog is suspected, he 
should be firmly chained la a place where 
neither children nor dogs or cats can 
get near him. Any one going to attend 
him should wear thick leather gloves, 
and proceed with great caution. When 
a dog snaps savagely at an imaginary 
object, it is almost a certain indication 
of madness ; and when it exhibits a 
terror of fluids, it is confirmed hydro-' 
phobia. Some dogs exhibit a great 
dislike of musical sounds, arid when 
this is the case they are too frequently 
made sport of. But it is a dangerous 
sport, as dogs have sometimes been 
driven mad by it. In many diseases 
dogs will be benefited by warm baths 
The mange is a contagious disease, 
which it is difficult to get rid of when 
once contracted. The best way is to 
apply to a veterinary chemist for an 
ointment, and to keep applying it for 
some time after the disease has disap- 
peared, or it will break out again. 

2651 . CATS. It is generally supposed 
that cats are more attached to places 
than to individuals, but this is an error. 
They obstinately cling to certain places, 
because it is there they expect to see 
the persons to whom they are attached. 
A cat will return to an empty house, 
and remain in it many weeks. But 
when at last she finds that the family 
does not return, she strays away, and if 
she chances then to find the family, 
she will abide with them. The same 
rules of feeding which apply to dogs 
apply also to cats. They should not 
be over-fed, nor too frequently. Cats 
are liable to the same diseases as dogs ; 
though they do not become ill so fre- 
quently. A little brimstone in their 
milk occasionally, is a good preventive. 
The veterinary chemist will also pre- 
scribe for the serious diseases of cats.

most important for cmixran.s, attendants

&c., &o. Tfn.y contain instructions nrt 
only for the compounding of medicines, 
lut most useful hints and cautions upon 
the application of leeches, blisters, poul- 
tices, &c. (Sec 158, 1714, 2186, 3313.) 

2653. ARTICLES REQUIRED FOR MIX- 
ING MEDICINES. Three glass measures, 
one to measure ounces, another to 
measure drachms, and a measure for 
minims or small doses. 

2654. A pestle and mortar of glass 
or Wedgwood ware, a glass funnel, and 
glass stirring rods. 

2655. A spatula or flexible knife for 
spreading ointments, making pills, &c. 

2656. A set of scales and weights. 

2657. A small slab of marble, slate 
or porcelain, for making pills upon, 
mixing- ointments, &e. 

2658. MEDICINE WEIGHTS AND MEAS- 
URES. Weights. When you open 
your box containing the scales and 
weights, you will observe that there are 
several square pieces of brass, of dif- 
ferent sizes and thicknesses, and 
stamped with a variety of characters. 
These are the weights, which we will 
now explain. 

2659. Medicines are made up by 
troy weight, although drugs are bought 
by avoirdupois weight, and of course 
you know that there are only twelve 
ounces to the pound troy, which is 
marked ib. ; then each ounce, which 
contains eight drachms, is marked 3i. ; 
each drachm containing three scruples, 
is marked i. ; and each scruple of 
twenty grains is marked 3i. The grain 
weights are marked by little circles, 
each circle signifying a grain. 

* Q"' 8 - Besides these weights, you 
I C I will find others marked 3ss, 
loo) which means half a scruple ; 
HSS, meaning half a drachm ; and 3ss, 
meaning half an ounce. When there 
are ounces, drachms, or scruples, the 
number of them is shown by Roman 
figures, thus: i. ii. iii. iv. v., &c.,and 
prescripts vis are written so. 



2660. Measures. Liquid medicine* 
are measured by the following tablet- 
CD minims ^ g f 1 fluid drachm. 

8 fluid drachms. 1 sr j ..1 fluid ounce 
16 fluid ounces, j | ] . .1 pint. 

8 pints J 5 ^ . . 1 gallon. 

and the signs which distinguish each 
are as follows; c, means a gallon ; o, 
a pint ; /3, a fluid ounce ; /3, a fluid 
drachm ; and 111, a minim. 

2661. Formerly drops used to be 
ordered, but as the size of a drop must 
necessarily vary, minims are always 
directed to be employed now, for any 
particular medicine, although for such 
medicines as oil of cloves, essence ol 
ginger, &c., drops are frequently or- 
dered. 

2662. In order that we may measure 
medicines accurately, there are grad- 
uated glass vessels for measuring 
ounces, drachms, and minims. 

2663. When proper measures are 
not at hand, it is necessary to adopt 
some other method of determining the 
quantities required, and therefore we 
have drawn up the following table for 
that purpose : 

A tumbler ^ c ( 

A teacup | 

A wineglass. . . ! g.-? ! 
A tablespoon.. \\\\ 
A dessertspoon. f. j 
A teaspoon. . . . j s ^ 

Some persons keep a medicine-glass, 
which is graduated so as to show the 
number of spoonfuls it contains. 

2664. PROCESS OF MAKING MEDICINES. 
To Powder Substances Place the 
substance in the mortar and strike it 
gently with direct perpendicular blows of 
the pestle, until it separates into several 
pieces, then remove all but a small por- 
tion, which bruise gently at first, and 
rub the pestle round and round the 
mortar, observing that the circles de- 
scribed by the pestle should gradually 
decrease in diameter, and then increase 
again, because by this means every 
part of the powder is subjected to th 
process of pulverization. (See 3101.* 

2665. Some substances require to be

prepared in a particular manner before 
they can be powdered, or to be assisted 
by adding some other body. For ex- 
ample, camphor powders more easily 
when a few drops of spirits of wine are 
added to it ; mace, nutmegs, and such 
oily aromatic substances are better for 
the addition of a little white sugar ; 
resins and gum resins should be pow- 
dered in a cold place, and if they are 
intended to be dissolved, a little fine 
well washed white sand mixed with 
them assists the process of powdering. 
Tough roots, like gentian and columba, 
should be cut into thin slices ; and 
fibrous roots, like ginger, cut slanting, 
otherwise the powder will be full of 
small fibres. Vegetable matters require 
to be dried before they are powdered, 
eucli as peppermint, loose-strife, senna, 
&c. 

2666. Be careful not to pound too 
hard in a glass, porcelain, or Wedge- 
wood's-ware mortar ; they are intended 
only for substances that pulverize easily, 
and for the purpose of mixing or incor- 
porating medicines. Never use acids 
in a marble mortar, and be sure that 
you do not powder galls or any other 
astringent substances in an iron mortar. 

2667. Sifting is frequently required 
for powdered substances, and this is 
usually done by employing a fine sieve,, 
or tying the powder up in a piece of 
muslin and striking it against the left 
hand over a piece of paper. 

2668. Filtering is frequently required 
for the purpose of obtaining clear fluids, 
tiich as infusions, eye-washes, and other 
medicines ; and it is therefore proper 
that you should know how to perform 
the simple operation. We must first of 
oil make the filter-paper ; this is done 
by taking a square sheet of white 
blotting paper, and doubling it over, 
BO as to form an angular cup. We 
next procure a piece of wire, and twist 
it into a form to place the funnel in, to 
prevent it passing too far into the neck 
of the bottle. Open out the filter- 
paper very carefully, and having placed 
it in the funnel, moisten it with a little 
watct. Then place tM wire in the 



space between the funnel and the bottle, 
and pour the liquid gently down the 
side of the paper, otherwise the fluid 
is apt to burst the paper. (See 3085.) 

2669. Maceration is another process 
that is frequently required to be per- 
formed in making up medicines, and 
consists simply in immersing the med- 
icines in cold water or spirits for a cer- 
tain time. 

2670. Digestion resembles macera- 
tion, except that the process is assisted 
by a gentle heat. The ingredients are 
placed in a flask, such as salad-oil is sold 
in, which should be fitted with a plug 
of tow or wood, and have a piece oi 
wire twisted round the neck. The flask 
is held by means of the wire over the 
flame of a spirit lamp, or else placed in 
some sand warmed in an old iron 
saucepan over the fire, care being taken 
not to place more of the flask below the 
sand than the portion occupied by the 
ingredients. 

"2671. Infusion is one of the most 
frequent operations required in making 
up medicines, its object being to ex- 
tract the aromatic and volatile prin- 
ciples of substances that would be lost 
by decoction or digestion ; and to extract 
the soluble from the insoluble parts 
of bodies. Infusions may be made with 
cold water, in which case they are 
weaker, but more pleasant. The gen- 
eral method employed consists in 
slicing, bruising, or powdering the in- 
gredients first, then placing them in a 
common jug (which should be as glob- 
ular as possible), and pouring boiling 
water over them ; cover the jug with 
a cloth folded six or eight times, but 
if there is a lid to the jug so much the 
better; when the infusion has stood 
the time directed, hold a piece of very 
coarse linen over the spout, and pour 
the liquid through it into another jug. 

2672. Decoction, or boiling, is em- 
ployed to extract the mucilaginous or 
unmiy parts of substances, their 
itter, astringent, or other qualities, 
and is nothing more than boiling the 
ingredients in a saucepan with the lid 
slightly raised. Be sure never to us

VERBS TELL OF SOMETHING BEING DONE 



nn iron saucepan for astringent decoc-. 
tions, such as oak bark, galls, &c., as 
they \vill turn the saucepan black and 
spoil the decoction. The enamelled 
saucepans are very useful for decoc- 
tions, but an excellent plan is to put the 
ingredients into a jar and boil the jar, 
thus preparing it by a water bath, as it 
is technically termed. 

2673. Extracts are made by evapo- 
nting the liquors obtained by infusion 
or decoction, but these can be bought 
much cheaper and better of chemists 
and druggists, and so can tinctures, 
confections, cerates, plasters, and 
syrups ; but as every one is not always 
in the neighbourhood of druggists, we 
shall give, recipes for those most gene- 
rally useful, and the method of making 
them. 

2674. PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED 
IN* GIVING MEDICINES. Sex. Medi- 
cines for females should not be so strong 
as those for males, therefore it is advis- 
able to reduce the doses about one- 
eighth. 

'2675. Temperament. Persons of a 
phlegmatic temperament bear stimu- 
lants and purgatives better than those 
of a sanguine temperament, therefore 
the latter require smaller doses. 

2676. Habits. Purgatives never act 
BO well upon persons accustomed to 
take them, as upon those who are not, 
therefore it is better to change the form 
of purgative from pill to potion, powder 
to draught, or aromatic to saline. 
Purgatives should never be given when 
there is an irritable state of the bowels. 

2677. Stimulants and narcotics never 
act so quickly upon persons accustomed 
to use spirit* freely as upon those who 
live abstemiously. 

2678. Climate. The action of medi- 
cines is modified by climate and sea- 
sons. In summer certain medicines 
uct more powerfully than in winter, 
and the same person cannot bear the 
dose in July that he could in De- 
cember. 

2679. General Health. Persons 
fv-hose general health is good, bear 
stronger dose? than the debilitated 



and those who have suffered for a long 
time, 

2680. Idiosyncrasy. Walker will in- 
form you that this long term mrana 
a peculiar temperament or disposition 
not common to people generally. Foi 
example, some persons cannot take 
calomel in the smallest dose without 
being salivated, or rhubarb without 
having convulsions ; others cannot take 
squills, opium, senna, &c., therefore ii 
is wrong to insist upon their taking 
these medicines. 

2681. Forms best suited for Adminis- 
tration. Fluids act quicker than 
solids, and powders sooner than pills. 

2682. Best method of Preventing the 
Naifscous Taste of Medicines. Castor 
oil may be taken in milk, coffee, or 
spirit, such as brandy; but the best 
method of covering the nauseous 
flavour is to put a table-spoonful of 
strained orange-juice in a wine-glass, 
pour the castor oil into the centre of 
the juice, and then squeeze a few drops 
of lemon-juice upon the top of the oil. 
Cod liver oil may be taken like castor- 
oil in orange juice. Peppermint water 
almost prevents the nauseous taste 
of Epsom salts ; a strong solution of 
extract of liquorice covers the disagree- 
able taste of aloes ; milk, that of 
cinchona bark ; and cloves that of 
senna. 

2683. An excellent way to prevent 
the taste of medicines is to have the 
medicine in a glass, as usual, and a 
tumbler of water by the side of it, then 
take the medicine and retain it in the 
mouth, which should be kept closed, 
and if you then commence drinking 
the water, the taste of the medicine is 
washed away. Even the bitterness d' 
quinine and aloes may be prevented by 
this means. 

2684. Giving Medicines to Persons 
Medicines should be given in such a 
manner that the effect of the first dose 
should not have ceased when the next 
dose is given, therefore the intervals 
between the doses should be regulated 
accordingly.

FERENT AGES. It must be plain to

doses of medicine. Now, we will sup- 
pose that the dose for a full-grown 
person is one drachm, then the follow- 
ing proportions will be suitable for the

2686. DRUGS, WITH THEIR PRO- 
PERTIES AND DOSES. We have 
arranged the various drugs according 
to their properties, and have given the 
doses of each ; but in compiling this 
we have necessarily omitted many from 
each class, because they cannot be em- 
ployed except by a medical man. The 
doses are meant for adults. 

2687. Medicines have been divided 
into four grand classes: 1. General 
Stimulants ; 2. Local Stimulants ; 3. 
Chemical Remedies ; 4. Mecnanical 
Remedies. 

2688. GENERAL STIMULANTS. Gene- 
ral Stimulants are sub-divided into two 
classes, diffusable and permanent stim- 
ulants : the first comprising narcotics 
and anti-spasmodics, and the second 
tonics and astringents. 

2689. NARCOTICS are medicines which 
stupefy and diminish the activity of the 
nervous system. Given in small doses, 
they generally act as stimulants, but 
an increased dose vroduces a stupefy- 



ing effect. Under this Lead we include 
ateohol, camphor, aether, the hop, and 
opium. 

2690. Alcohol, or rectified spirit, is a 
very powerful stimulant, and is never 
used as a remedy without being diluted 
to the degree called proof spirit ; and 
even then it is seldom used internally. 

It is used externally in restraining 
bleeding, when there is not any vessel 
of importance wounded. It is also 
used as a lotion to burns, and is applied 
by dipping a piece of lint into the 
spirit, and laying it over the part. 

Freely diluted (one part to eighteen) 
with water, it forms a useful eye-wash,, 
in the last stage of ophthalmia. 

Used internally, it acts as a very use- 
ful stimulant when diluted and taken 
moderately, increasing the general ex- 
citement, and giving energy to the 
muscular fibres; hence it becomes 
very useful in certain cases of debility, 
especially in habits disposed to create 
acidity ; and in the low stage of fevers. 

Dose. It is impossible to fix any- 
thing like a dose for this remedy, as 
much will depend upon the individual ; 
but diluted with water, and sweetened 
with sugar, from half an ounce to two 
ounces may be given three or four 
times a-day. In cases of extreme de- 
bility, however, much will depend upon 
the disease. 

Caution. Remember that alcohol is 
an irritant poison, and that the indul- 
gence in its use daily originates dys- 
pepsia or indigestion, and many other 
serious complaints. Of all kinds of 
spirits, the best cordial and stomachic 
is brandy. 

2691. Camphor is not a very steady 
stimulant, as its effect is transitory ; 
but in large doses it acts as a narcotic, 
abating pain, and inducing sleep. In 
moderate doses it operates as a diapho- 
retic and anti-spasmodic, increasing the 
heat of the body, allaying irritation 
and spasm. 

It is used externally as a liniment 
when dissolved in oil, alcohol, or acetio 
acid, being employed to allay rheumatic 
pa'r.3 ; and it is also useful as an en>

brocation in sprains, bruise:?, chilblains, 
and, when combined with opium, it 
has been advantageously employed in 
flatulent colic and severe diarrhosa, 
being rubbed over the bowels. 

When reduced tv a fine powder by 
the addition of a little spirit of wine 
and friction, it is very useful as a local 
stimulant to indolent ulcers, especially 
when they discharge a foul kind of 
matter ; a pinch is taken between the 
finger and thumb, and sprinkled into 
the ulcer, which is then dressed as usual. 

"When dissolved in oil of turpentine, 
and a few drops are placed in a hollow 
tooth and covered with jewellers' wool, 
or scraped lint, it gives almost instant 
relief to toothache. 

Used internally, it is apt to excite 
nausea, and even vomiting, especially 
when given in the solid form. 

As a stimulant it is of great service 
in all low fevers, malignant measles, 
malignant sore throat, and running 
small-pox ; and when combined with 
opium and bark, it is extremely useful 
in checking the progress of malignant 
ulcers, and gangrene. 

As a narcotic it is very useful, be- 
cause it allays pain and irritation, with- 
out increasing the pulse very much. 

When powdered and sprinkled upon 
the surface of a blister, it prevents the 
cantharides acting in a peculiar and 
painful manner upon the bladder. 

Combined with senna it increases its 
purgative properties; and it is also 
used to correct the nausea produced by 
squills, and the irritating effects of 
drastic purgatives and mezereon. 

Dose, from four grains to one scru- 
ple, repeated at short intervals when 
used in small doses, and long intervals 
when employed in large doses. 

Doses of the vaiious preparations : 
Camphor mixture, from half an ounce 
to three ounces ; compound tincture 
of camphor (Paregoric Elixir), from 
fifteen minims to one drachm. 

Caution. When given in an over- 
dose it acts as a poison, producing 
vomiting, giddiness, delirium, convul 
', and sometimes death. 



Mode of Exhibition It may bo rub- 
bed up with almond emulsion, or nm- 
cilage, or the yolk of eggs, and by tlua 
means suspended in water, or com- 
bined with chloroform as a mixture, in 
which form it is a valuable stimulant 
in cholera and other diseases. (See Mix- 
tures.) 

2692. JEther is a diffusablc stimu- 
lant, narcotic, and anti-spasmodic. Sul- 
phuric JEther is used externally, both as 
a stimulant and a refrigerant. 

In the former case its evaporation is 
prevented by covering a rag moistened 
with it with oiled silk, in order to 
relieve headache ; and in the latter 
case it is allowed to evaporate, and 
thus produce coldness : hence it is ap- 
plied over scalded surfaces by means 
of rags dipped in it. 

As a local application, it has been 
found to afford almost instant relief in 
ear-ache, when combined with almond 
oil, and dropped into the ear. 

Internally it is used as a stimulant 
and narcotic in low fevers and cases of 
great exhaustion. 

Dose, from fifteen minims to one and 
a half drachm, repeated at short inter- 
vals, as its effects soon pass off. It is 
usually given in a little camphor julep 
or water. 

2693. Nitric JEther is a refrigerant, 
diuretic, and anti-spasmodic, and is 
well known as " sicect spirit of nitre." 

Used externally, its evaporation re- 
lieves headache, and it is sometimes 
applied to burns. 

Internally it is used to relieve 
nausea, flatulence, and thirst in fevers; 
also as a diuretic. 

Dose from ten minims to one drachm. 

2694. Compound Spirit of Sulphuric 
JEther is a very useful stimulant, nar- 
cotic and anti- spasmodic. 

Used internally in cases of great ex- 
haustion, attended with irritability. 

Dose, from half a drachm to two 
drachms, in camphor julep. When 
combined with laudanum it prevents 
the nauseating effects of the opium.* 
and acts more beneficially as a nat-

2695. The Hop is a narcotic, tonic, 
and diuretic ; it reduces the frequency 
of the pulse, and does not affect the 
ii'oud, likr 7iiost anodynes. 

Used externally, it acts as an ano- 
dyne and discutient, and is useful as a 
fomentation for painful tumours, rheu- 
matic pains in the joints, and severe 
contusions. A pillow stuffed with hops 
acts as a narcotic. 

When the powder is mixed with 
lard, it acts as an anodyne dressing in 
painful ulcers. 

Dose, of the extract, from five grains 
to one scruple ; of the tincture, from 
half a drachm to two drachms ; of the 
powder, from three grains to one scru- 
ple ; of the infusion, half an ounce to 
one and a half ounce. 

269(3. Opium is a stimulant, narcotic, 
and anodyne. 

Used externally it acts almost as well 
as when taken into the stomach, and 
without affecting the head or causing 
nausea. 

Applied to irritable ulcers in the 
form of tincture, it promotes their 
cure, and allays pain. 

Cloths dipped in a strong solution, 
and applied over painful bruises, tu- 
mours, or inflamed joints, alhy pain. 

A small piece of solid opium stuffed 
into a hollow tooth relieves toothache. 

A weak solution of opium forms a 
valuable colly rium in ophthalmia. 

Two drops of the wine of opium 
dropped into the eye, acts as an excel- 
lent stimulant in bloodshot eye ; or 
after long-continued inflammation, it is 
useful in strengthening the eye. 

Applied as a liniment, in combination 
with ammonia and oil. or with cam- 
phorated spirit, it relieves muscular 
pain. 

When combined with oil of turpen- 
tine, it is useful as a liniment in spas- 
modic colic. 

Used internally it acts as a very pow- 
erful stimulant ; then as a sedative, and 
.finally as an anodyne and narcotic, al- 
laying pain in the most extraordinary 
manner, by acting directly upon the 
nervous system 



In acute rheumatism it is a most ex 
celient medicine, when combined with 
calomel and tartrate of antimony ; but 
its exhibition requires the judicious 
care of a medical man. 

Doses of the various preparations : 
Confection of opium, from five grains 
to half a drachm ; extract of opium, 
from one to five grains (this is a valua- 
ble form, as it does not produce so 
much after-derangement of the nervous 
system as solid opium) ; pills of soap 
and opium, from five to ten grains ; 
compound ipecacuanha poicder (" Do 
ver's powders "j, from five to twenty 
grains : compound kino powder, from 
five to twenty grains ; ic ine of opium,

when taken in too large a quantity 
(See Poisons), and therefore should 
be used with extreme caution. It is 
on this account that we have omitted 
some of its preparations. 

2G97. ANTI-SPASMODICS are medi- 
cines which possess the power of over- 
coming spasms of the muscles, or 
allaying any severe pain which is not 
attended by inflammation. The class 
includes a great many, but the most 
safe and serviceable you will find to be 
ammonia, assafoetida, galbanum, valer- 
ian, bark, aether, camphor, opium, and 
chloroform ; with the minerals, oxide 
of zinc and calomel. 

2698. Ammonia or " Volatile salt," 
is an anti-spasmodic, antacid, stimulant, 
and diaphoretic. 

Used externally, combined with oil, 
it forms a cheap and useful liniment, 
but it should be dissolved iu proof 
spirit before the oil is added. 

One part of this salt, and three parts 
of extract of belladonna, mixed and 
spread upon leather, makes an excel- 
lent plaster for relieving rheumatic 
pains. 

As a local stimulant it is well known, 
as regards its effects in hysterics, faint- 
ness and lassitude, when applied to the 
nose as common smelling- salts.

errhine. 

Used internally, combined with 
opium, it acts as an anti-spasmodic in 
locked jaw, cholera, and many other

It acts beneficially in dropsies, by 
producing watery motions. 

In typhus it is of great benefit when

phoretic, and expectorant. 

It is used internally to excite vomit- 
ing in doses of from twenty to thirty 
grains of the powder, or o ne to one 
and a half ounce of the infusion, every 
half hour until vomiting takes place. 

To make it act well and easily, the 
patient should drink half-pint doses of 
warm water. 

As a diaphoretic it should be given 



in doses of three grains, mixed with 
some soft substance, such as crumbs of 
bread, and repeated every four hours. 

Dose of the wine from twenty minims 
to one drachm (as a diaphoretic) ; and 
from one drachm to one and a half 
ounce (as an emetic). 

Caution. Do not give more than the 
doses named above, because, although a 
safe emetic, yet it is an acriduarcotic 
poison. 

2726. Mustard is too well known to 
require describing. It is an emetic, 
diuretic, stimulant, and rubefacient. 

It is used externally as a poultice, 
(which is made of the powder, bread-

cessary). 

In all cases where a stimulant is re- 
quired, such as sore throats, rheumatic 
pains in the joints, cholera, cramps in 
the extremities, diarrhoea, and many 
other diseases. 

When applied it should not be left 
on too long, as it is apt to cause ulcera- 
tion of the part. From ten to thirty 
minutes is quite long enough. 

When used internally as an emetic, a 
large tea- spoonful mixed with a tum- 
bler of warm water generally operates 
quickly and safely, frequently when 
other emetics have failed. 

In dropsy it is sometimes given in 
the form of whey, which is made by 
boiling half an ounce of the bruised 
seeds in a pint of milk, and straining 
off the curd. From three to four 
ounces of this is to be taken for a doso 
three times a day.

As a refringent beverage in fevers :t 
is extremely grateful. 

2730. Castor oil is a most valuable 
medicine, as it generally operates 
quickly and mildly.

citron ointment, as a topical application 
in common leprosy.

purgative for infants, as a laxative for 
adults, and in diarrhoea and dysentery.

drachms, mixed in milk or with treacle. 
When combined with an equal propor- 
tion of cream of tartar it acts as a pur- 
gative. 

2732. Magnesia. Calcined magnesia 
possesses the same properties as the 
carbonate. 

Dose from ten to thirty grains, in 
milk or water. 

Carbonate of magnesia is an antacid 
and laxative, and is very useful for 
children when teething, and heartburn 
in adults. 

Dose from a half to two drachms, in 
water or milk. 

2733 Senna is a purgative, but is 
apt to gripe when given alone ; there- 
fore it is combined with some aromatic, | 
*uch as cloves or ginger, and the infu- i 



sion should be made with cold instead 
of hot water. It usually acts in about 
four hours, but its action should be 
assisted by drinking warm fluids. 

Dose of the confection, commonly 
called "lenitive electuary," from one to 
three or four drachms at bed-time ; of 
the infusion, from one to two ounces ; 
of the tincture, from one to two

2761. We shall pass over the class of 
ERRHINES or medicines to cause sneez- 
ing, to consider EPISPASTICS and 
RUBEFACIENTS; or those remedies 
which are applied to blister and cause 
redness of the surface. They consist 
'jf cantharides, ammonia, Burgundy 
pitch, and mustard. 

9762. Cantharides or Spanish flies, 
when used internally, are diuretic and 
stimulant ; and epispastic and rubefa- 
cient when applied externally. 

Mode of Application. A portion of 
the blistering plaster is spread with the 
thumb upon brown paper, linen, or 
leather, to the size required ; its surface' 
then slightly moistened with olive oil 
and sprinkled with camphor, and the 
plaster applied by a light bandage. 

Caution. If a blister is to be applied 
to the head, shave it at least ten hours 
before it is put on ; and it is better to 
place a thin piece of gauze, wetted with 
vinegar, between the skin and the blis- 
ter. If a distressing feeling be expe- 
rienced about the bladder, give warm 
and copious draughts of linseed-tea, 
tnilk, or decoction of quince-seeds, and 
apply warm fomentations of milk and 
water to the blistered surface. 

The period required for a blister to 



remain on varies, from eight to ten 
hours for adults, and from twenty 
minutes to two hours for children : aa 
soon as it is removed, if the blister is 
not raised, apply a " spongio-piline'' 
poultice, and it will then rise properly 
When it is required to act as a rubefa- 
cient, the blister should remain on 
from one to three hours for adults, and 
from fifteen to forty minutes for 
children. 

To dress a blister: Cut the bag ol 
suticle containing the serum at the 
lowest part, by snipping it with the 
scissors, so as to form an opening like 
this V ; and then apply a piece of 
calico spread with spermaceti or some 
other dressing. 

Caution. Never attempt to exhibit 
cantharides internally, as it is a poison, 
and requires extreme caution in its use 
even by medical men. 

2763. Burgundy pitch is wanned and 
spread upon linen or leather, and ap- 
plied over the chest in cases of catarrh, 
difficult breathing, and hooping-cough , 
over the loins in debility or lumbago ; 
and over any part that it is desirable 
to excite a mild degree of inflamma- 
tion in.

ALL THINGS HAVE A BEGINNING, GOD EXCEPTED. 



of the juice to twenty grains of the 
salt), and taken, while effervescing, 
allays vomiting; a table-spoonful, taken 
occasionally, allays hysterical palpita- 
tions of the heart. It is useful in 
scurvy caused by eating too much salt 
food.

stomachic in certain forms of dyspepsia. 

Dose of the infusion (made the same 
as orange-peel), from one to two ounces. 

2768. ANTACIDS are given to correct 
acidity in the system. They are soda, 
ammonia, chalk, and magnesia. 

2769. Soda, carbonate of, and sesqui- 
carbonate of soda, are antacids and de- 
obstruents. They are used internally in 
acidity of the stomach and dyspepsia.

solution of chloride of zinc. 

2774. Bluestone, or sulphate of cop- 
per, is 'used in a solution of from four 
to fifteen grains to the ounce of water, 

nd applied to foul and indolent ulcers, 
y means of rag dipped in it, and is 
wbbed, in substance on fungous 
rowths, warts, &c., to destroy them. 
Caution. It is a poison. 

2775. Lunar Caustic, or nitrate of 
Uver, is an excellent remedy in erysip- 
elas when applied in solution ''one 
drachm of the salt to one ounce of 
water), which should be brushed all 



over the inflamed part, and for an inch 
beyond it. This blackens the skin, but 
it soon peels off. 

To destroy warts, proud flesh, and 
unhealthy edges of ulcers, &c., it is in- 
valuable ; and as an application to bed- 
sores, pencilled over with a solution of 
the same strength, and in the same 
manner as for erysipelas. 

Caution. It is a poison. 

2776. Solution of chloride of 'zinc, or 
more commonly known as " Sir Wil- 
liam Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid," is a 
valuable escharotic in destroying the 
parts of poisoned wounds, such as the 
bite of a mad dog. 

It is also very useful in restoring 
the hair after the scalp has been at- 
tacked with ringworm ; but its use re- 
quires extreme caution, as it is a power- 
ful escharotic. In itch, diluted (one 
part to thirty-two) with water, it ap- 
pears to answer very well. 

Caution. It is a most powerful 
poison. 

2777. MECHANICAL REMEDIES. 
The mechanical remedies comprise 
anthelmintics, demulcents, diluents, 
and emollients. 

2778. ANTHELMINTICS are medicines 

given for the purpose of expelling or 
estroying worms. They are cowhage,

round worm, which it does by wound- 
ing it with the fine prickles. 

Dose of the confection, for a child 
three or four years old, a tea-spoonful 
early, for three mornings, followed by 
a dose of castor oil. (See " Domestic

2792. POUNDING ALMONDS. 
They should be dried for a few days 
after being- blanched. Set them in a 
warm place, strewn singly over a dish 
or tin. A little powdered lump sugar 
will assist the pounding. They may be 
first chopped small, and rolled with a 
rolling-pin. ALMOND PASTE may be 
made in the same manner. 

2793. ANCHOVY BUTTER Scrape 
the skin from a dozen fine anchovies,

2797. APRICOTS STEWED in 
SYRUP. Wipe thedowu frqm young 
apricots, and stew them as gently as 
possible in a syrup made of four ounces 
of sugar to half a pint of water, boiled 
the usual time. 

2798. Dry Apricots. Take before

then lay them on glasses to dry. 

2799. Apricot Jelly. Pare the fruit 
thin, and stone it; weigh an equal 
quantity of sugar in fine pow r der, and

liquor over. The next day pour the 
liquor to a quart of codling-liquor ; let 
it boil quickly till it will jelly; put the 
fruit into it, and boil ; skim well, and 
put into email pots. 

2800. SWIMMING. Every person, 
male and female, should endeavor to 
acquire the power of swimming. The 
fact that the exercise is a healthful ac- 
companiment of bathing, and that lives 
may be saved by it, even when least 
expected, is a sufficient argument for 
the recommendation. The art of swim- 
ming is, in fact, very easy, and those 
persons who take the few brief hints 
we are about to offer, will soon find 
themselves rewarded by complete suc- 
cess. The first consideration is not to 
attempt to learn to swim too soon. 
That is to say, you must not expect to 
succeed in your efforts to swim, until 
you have become accustomed to the 
water, and have overcome your repug- 
nance to the coldness and novelty of 
bathing. Every attempt will fail until 
\ou have acquired a certain confidence 
in the water, and then the difficulty 
will soon vanish. When this confid ince 
nap be^n gained, thr following hir *s by 



the celebrated Dr. Franklin will be 
found all that can be required : 

2801. DR. FRANKLIN'S ADVICE 
TO SWIMMERS. "The only obstacle 
to improvement in this necessary and 
life-preserving art, is fear; and it is 
only by overcoming this timidity that 
you can expect to become a master of 
the following acquirements. It is very 
common for novices in the art of swim- 
ming to make use of corks or bladders 
to assist in keeping the body above wa- 
ter ; some have utterly condemned the 
use of them ; however, they may be of 
service for supporting the body, while 
one is learning what is called the stroke, 
or that manner of drawing in and 
striking out the hands and feet, that is 
necessary to produce progressive mo- 
tion. But you w r ill be no swimmer 
till you can place confidence in the 
power of the water to support you ; I 
would, therefore, advise the acquiring 
that confidence in the first place ; es- 
pecially as I have known several, who, 
by a little practice necessary for that 
purpose, have insensibly acquired the 
stroke, taught as it were by nature. 
The practice I mean is this : choosing 
a place where the water deepens grad- 
ually, walk coolly into it till it is up to 
your breast ; then turn round your face 
to the shore, and throw an egg into the 
water between you and the shore ; it 
will sink to the bottom, and be easily 
seen there if the water is clean. It 
must lie in the water so deep that you 
cannot reach to take it up but by div- 
ing for it. To encourage yourself, in 
order to do this, reflect that your pro- 
gress will be from deep to shallow wa- 
ter, and that at any time you may, by 
bringing your legs under you, and 
standing on the bottom, raise your head 
far above the water; then plunge un- 
der it with your eyes open, which must 
be kept open before going under, as 
you cannot open the eyelids for the 
weight of water above you ; throwing 
yourself toward the egg, and endeav- 
ouring, by the action of your hands 
and feet against the water, to get for- 
ward, till within reach of it. In this 



A TOOil PURSE MAKES A BLEAT MERCHANT. 



345 



attempt you will find that the water 
buoys you up against your inclination ; 
that it is not so easy to sink as you 
imagine, and that you cannot, but by 
active force, get down to the egg. Thus 
you feel the power of water to support 
you, and learn to confide in that power 
while your endeavors to overcome it 
and reach the egg, teach you the man- 
ner of acting on the water with your 
feet and hands, which action is after- 
wards used in swimming to support 
your head higher above the water, or 
to go forward through it. 

2802. " I would the more earnestly 
press you to the trial of this method, 
because I think I shall satisfy you that 
your body is lighter than water, and 
that you might float in it a long time 
with your mouth free for breathing, if 
you would put yourself into a proper 
posture, and would be still, and forbear 
struggling ; yet, till you have obtained 
thip experimental confidence in the 
water, I cannot depend upon your 
having the necessary presence of mind 
to recollect the posture, and the direc- 
tions I gave you relating to it. The 
surprise may put all out of your mind. 

2803. " Though the legs, arms, and 
head of a human body, being solid 
parts, are, specifically, somewhat heav- 
ier than fresh water, as the trunk, par- 
ticularly the upper part, for its hollow- 
ness, is so much lighter than water, as 
that the whole of the body, taken alto- 
gether, is too light to sink wholly un- 
der water, but some pait will remain 
above, until the lungs become filled 
with water, which happens from draw- 
ing water to them instead of air, when 
a person, in the fright, attempts breath- 
ing, while the rnouth and nostrils are 
under water. 

2804. " The legs and arms are spe- 
cifically lighter than salt water, and 
will be supported by it, so that a hu- 
man body cannot sink in salt water, 
though the lungs were filled as above, 
but from the greater specific gravity 
of the head. Therefore, a person 
throwing h'inself on his back in salt 
witter, nd exteiriiiq; his wins, may 



easily lay so as to keep his mouth and 
nostrils free for breathing ; and, by a 
small motion of his hand, may pre\ ent 
turning, if he should perceive any ten- 
dency to it. 

2805. "In fresh water, if a man 
throw himself on his back, near the 
surface, he cannot long continue in 
that situation but by proper action of 
his hands on the water; if he use no 
such action, the legs and lower part of 
the body will gradually sink till he 
come into an upright position, in which 
he will continue suspended,the hollow of 
his breast keeping the head uppermost. 

2806. " But if, in this erect position, 
the head be kept upright above the 
shoulders, as when we stand on the 
ground, the immersion will, by the 
weight of that part of the head that is 
out of the water, reach above the 
mouth and nostrils, perhaps a little 
above the eyes, so that a man cannot 
long remain suspended in water, with 
his head in that position. 

2807. " The body continuing sus- 
pended as before, and upright, if the 
bead be leaned quite back, so that the 
face look upward, all the back part oi 
the head being under water, and its 
weight consequently, in a great meas- 
ure supported by it, the face will re- 
main above water quite free for breath- 
ing, will rise an inch higher every 
inspiration, and sink as much every 
expiration, but never so low as that 
the water may come over the mouth. 

2808. " If, therefore, a person unac- 
quainted with swimming, and falling 
accidentally into the water could have 
presence of mind sufficient to avoid 
struggling and plunging, and to let the 
body take this natural position, h 
might continue long safe from drown- 
ing, till, perhaps, help should come ; for, 
as to the clothes their additional weight 
when immersed is very inconsiderable, 
the water supporting it ; though when 
he comes out of the water, he will find 
them very heavy indeed. 

2809. " But, as I said before, I would 
not advise you or any one, to depend on 
having this presence of mind on such an

AS LONG RUNS THE FOX AS HE FEET HATH. 



occasion, but learn fairly to swim, as I 
wish all men were taught to do in their 
youth ; they w r ould, on many occasions, 
be the safer for having that skill ; and, 
on many more, the happier, as free 
from painful apprehensions of danger, 
to say nothing of the enjoyment in so 
delightful and wholesome an exercise. 
Soldiers particularly should, metbinks, 
all be taught to swim ; it might be 
of frequent use, either in surprising an 
enenay or saving themselves ; and if I 
had now boys to educate, I should pre- 
fer those schools (other things being 
equal), where an opportunity was af- 
forded for acquiring so advantageous an 
art, which, once learned, is never for- 
gotten. 

2810. "I know by experience, that 
it is a great comfort to a swimmer, who 
has a considerable distance to go, to 
turn himself sometimes on his back, 
and to vary in other respects the means 
of procuring a progressive motion. 

2811. " When he is seized with the 
cramp in the leg, the method of driv- 
ing it away is, to give the parts affected 
a sudden, vigorous, and violent shock ; 
which he may do in the air as he 
swims on his back. 

2812. "During the great heats in 
summer there is no danger in bathing, 
however warm we may be, in rivers 
which have been thoroughly warmed 
by the sun. But to throw one's self 
into cold spring water, when the body 
has. been heated by exercise in the sun, 
is an imprudence which may prove 
fatal. I once knew an instance of four 
young men, who, having worked at 
harvest in the heat of the day, with a 
view of refreshing themselves, plunged 
into a spring of cold water ; two died 
upon the spot, a third next morning, 
and the fourth recovered with great 
difficulty. A copious draught of cold 
water, in similar circumstances, is fre- 
quently attended with the same effect, 
in North America. 

2813. "The exercise of swimming is 
one of the most healthy and agreeable 
in the world. After having swam an 
hour or two in the evening, one sleeps 



coolly the whole night, even during tho 
most ardent heats of summer. Per- 
haps the pores being cleansed, the in 
sensible perspiration increases and 
occasions this coolness. It is certain 
that much swimming is the means of 
stopping diarrhoea, and even of produc- 
ing constipation. With respect to 
those who do not know how to swim, 
or who are affected with diarrhoea at a 
season which does not permit them to 
use that exercise, a warm bath, by 
cleansing- and purifying the skin, is 
found very salutary, and often effects a 
radical cure. 1 speak from my own ex- 
perience, frequently repeated, and that 
of others to whom I have recommended 
this. 

2814. " When I was a boy, I amused 
myself one day with flying- a paper 
kite ; and approaching the banks of a 
lake, which was near a mile broad, I 
tied the string to a stake, and the kite 
ascended to a very considerable height 
above the pond, while I was swimming. 
In a little time being desirous of amus- 
ing myself with my kite, and enjoying 
at the same time the pleasure of swim- 
ming, I returned and loosening from 
the stake the string with the little 
stick which was fastened to it, went 
again into the water, where I found that, 
lying on my back and holding the stick 
in my hand, I was drawn along the sur- 
face of the water in a very agreeable 
manner. Having then engaged another 
boy to carry my clothes round the pond, 
to a place which I pointed out to him, 
on the other side, I began to cross the 
pond with my kite, which carried me 
quite over without the least fatigue, and 
with the greatest pleasure imaginable. 
I was only obliged occasionally to halt 
a little in my course, and resist its pro- 
gress, when it appeared that by following 
too quick, I lowered the kite too much ; 
by doing which occasionally I made it 
rise again. I have never since that 
time practiced this singular mode of 
swimming-, though I think it not im- 
possible to cross, in this manner, from 
Dover to Calais. The packet-boat 
however, is still preferable*''

2815. Those who prefer the aid of 
belts will find it very easy and safe to 
make belts upon the plan explained, 
(2181), and by gradually reducing the 
floating power of the belts from day to 
day, they will gain confidence, and 
speedily acquire the Art of Swimming. 

2816. TAKING A HOUSE. Be- 
fore taking a house, be careful to calcu- 
late that the rent is not too high in 
proportion to your means ; for remem- 
ber that the rent is a claim which must 
be paid with but little delay, and that 
the landlord has greater power over 
your property than any other creditor. 

2817. Having determined the amount 
of rent which you can afford to pay, 
be careful to select the best house 
which can be obtained for that sum. 
And in making that selection let the 
following matters be carefully con- 
sidered : 

2818. First Carefully regard the 
healthl'ulness of the situation. Avoid 
the neighborhood of graveyards, and 
of factories giving forth unhealthy va- 
pours; avoid low and damp districts, 
the course of canals, and localities of 
reservoirs of water, gas works, &c. ; 
make inquiries as to the drainage of 
the neighborhood, and inspect the 
drainage and water supply of the prem- 
ises. A house standing on an incline 
is likely to be better drained than one 
standing upon the summit of a hill, or on 
a level below a hill. Endeavor to ob- 
tain a position where the direct sun- 
light falls upon tho house, for this is 
absolutely necessary to health; and 
give preference to a bouse the openings 
of which are sheltered from the north 
und east winds. 

2819. Second Consider the distance 
of the house from your place of occu- 
pation ; and also its relation to provis- 
ion markets, and the prices that 
prevail in the neighborhood. 

2820. Having considered these ma- 
terial and leading features, examine 
the house in detail, carefully loDking 
intc its state of repair; notice the win- 
dmvs that are broken; whether the 

15* 



chimneys smoke ; whether they have 
been recently swept ; whether the papei 
on the wails is damaged, especially in 
the lower parts, and the corners, by 
the skirtings ; whether the locks, bolts, 
handles of doors, and window -fasten- 
ings are in proper condition ; make a 
list of the fixtures ; ascertain whether 
all rent and taxes were paid up by the 
previous tenant, and whether the part;? 
from whom you take the house is the> 
original landlord, or his agent or tenant. 
And do not commit yourself by the 
signing of any agreement until you are 
satisfied upon all these points, and see 
that all has been done wliich the landlord 
had undertaken. 

282J. TAKING A SHOP OR 
PLACE OF BUSINESS. If you 
are about to take a place of business, 
you will do well to consider the follow- 
ing remarks : 

2822. Small Capitalists. Let us 
take the case of a person who has no 
intimate knowledge of any particular 
trade, but having a very small capital, 
is about to embark it in the exchange 
of commodities for cash, in order to 
obtain an honest livelihood thereby. 
It is clear, that unless such a person 
starts with proper precaution and judg- 
ment, the capital will be expended 
without adequate results; rent and 
taxes will accumulate, the stock will 
lie dead or become deteriorated, and 
loss and ruin must follow. For the 
least absorption acting upon a small 
capital will soon dry up its source ; and 
we need not picture the trouble that 
will arise when the mainspring of a 
tradesman's success abides by him no 
more. 

2823. Larger Capitalists. The case 
of the larger capitalist can scarcely fcws 
considered an exception to the same 
rule. For it is probable that the larger 
capitalist, upon commencing business, 
would sink more of his funds in a larger 
stock would incur liability to a 
heavier rent ; and the attendant taxes, 
the wages of assistants and servants 
vould Ke grer ter ; and therefore, if the 



848 



A WIGHT MAN NEVER WANTED A WEA.70N. 



return come not speedily, similar con- 
sequences must sooner or later ensue. 

'2824. Localities. Large or small 
capitalists should, there lore, upon en- 
tering on a shop-keeping speculation, 
consider well the nature of the locality 
in which they propose to carry on trade, 
the number of the population, and the 
habits and wants of the people, and the 
extent to which they are already sup- 
plied with the goods which the sett 
adventurer proposes to offer them. 

2825. New Neighbourhoods. There 
IB a tendency among small capitalists 
to rush into new neighborhoods, with 
the expectation of making an early 
connexion. Low rents also serve as 
an attraction to those localities. We 
have found, however, in our experience, 
that the ealy suburban shops seldom 
succeed. They are generally entered 
upon at the very earliest moment that 
trie state of the locality will permit 
often before the house is finished the 
shop is tenanted, and goods exposed 
for sale even while the streets are 
unpaved, and while the roads are as 
rough and uneven as country lanes. 
The consequence is that, as the few 
inhabitants of these localities have fre- 
quent communication with adjacent 
towns, they, as a matter of habit or of 
choice, supply their chief wants 
thereat ; and the suburban shopkeeper 
depends principally for support upon 
the accidental forgetfulness of his 
neighbour, who omits to bring some- 
thing from the better and cheaper 
market, or upon the changes of 
the weather, which may sometimes fa- 
vour him by rendering a " trip to town " 
exceedingly undesirable. 

2826. Failure? " While the grass is 
growing the horse is starving;" and 
thus, while the new district is becoming 
peopled the funds of the small shop- 
keeper are gradually eaten up, and he 
puts up his shutters just at the time 
when a more cautious speculator steps 
in to profit by the connexion already 
formed, and to take advantage of 
the now improved condition of the 
locality. It seems therefore desirable 



for the small capitalist rather to run th 
risk of a more expensive rent, in a well 
peopled district, than to resort to placef 
of slow and uncertain demand ; for the 
welfare of the small shopkeeper depends 
entirely upon the frequency with which 
his limited stock is cleared out and re- 
placed by fresh supplies. 

2827. Precautions. But should the 
small capitalist still prefer opening in a 
1 suburban district, where competition is 
less severe,, and" rents and rates less 
burdensome, there are certain precau- 
tions which he will do well to observe. 
He should particularly guard against 
opening a shop to supply what may bo 
termed the superfluities of life ; for the 
inhabitants of suburban districts are 
those who, like himself, have resorted 
to a cheap residence for the sake of 
economy. Or, if this be not the case 
if they are people of independent means, 
who prefer the " detached villa" to the 
town-house, squeezed up on both sides, 
they have the means of riding and 
driving to town, and will prefer choos- 
ing articles of taste and luxury from the 
best marts, enriched by the finest dis- 



"If* 



828. Necessities or Luxuries. The 
suburban shopkeeper should, therefore, 
confine himself to supplying the necessi- 
ties of life. Hungry people dislike to 
fetch their bread from five miles off ; 
and to bring vegetables from a long dis- 
tance would evidently be a matter of 
considerable inconvenience. The baker, 
the butcher, the green-grocer, the beer 
retailer, &c., are those who find their 
successes first established in suburban 
localities. And not until these are doing 
well, should the tailor, the shoemaker, 
the hatter, the draper, the hosier, and 
others, expect to find return for their 
capital and reward for their labour. 

2829. Civility. In larger localities, 
where competition abounds, the small 
shopkeeper frequently outstrips his 
more powerful rival by one element of 
success, which may be added to any 
stock without cost, but cannot be with- 
held without loss. That element is 
civility. It has already been spoken oJ 



A GREEbf MAN GOD HATES.

elsewhere, but must be enforced here, 
as aiding the little means of the small 
BnopKeeper to a wonderful degree . A 
kind and obliging manner carries with 
it an indescribable charm. It must 
not be a manner which indicates a 
mean, grovelling, time-serving spirit, 
but a plain, open, and agreeable de 
meanour, which seems to desire to 
oblige for the pleasure of doing so, and 
not for the sake of squeezing an extra 
penny out of a customer's pocket. 

2830. Failures of Large Shopkeepers. 
The large shopkeeper frequently 
grows proud of his position ; there are 
many little civilities which customers 
like, but which the large shopkeeper 
may be too busy or unwilling to pay. 
He forgets that these civilities are the 
steps by which he rose, and that the 
withdrawal of them must lead to his 
rapid descent. These are the points 
upon which large traders are often 
weak, and where the small trader finds 
them vulnerable. Punctuality, cleanli- 
ness, the neat arrangement of the stock, 
the attractiveness of te window, the 
absence of all absurd puffing, the early 
and regular opening of the shop in the 
morning, and the attention paid to every 
one entering it these are the secrets 
of the small shopkeeper's success against 
the influence of giant capital. They 
are a series of charms before which 
even gold itself must yield its potent in- 
fluence. 

2831. Connection. In small towns 
" connection" has a great deal to do 
with the success of the shopkeeper 
There are, accordingly, special cases 
which we are not prepared to discuss. 
For instance, if a shopkeeper proposed 
to set up a rivalry against an old-estab- 
lished and respectable tradesman, w r e 
should certainly feel inclined to advise 
him to pause in the attempt. But if he 
replied that his " connections" were 
sufficient to support him, that might be 
expected to overrule our objection. 
Connections, however, must not be 
too implicitly relied upon. They are, 
us a general rule, more exacting and 
less easily satisfied than the general 



public. We have known many ail un- 
fortunate victim to the promisee ol 
" connections'' open with the most 
growing prospects, and close with the 
most disastrous results. 

2832. Your " connection," of course, 
expects you to give credit. 

2833. Your " connection" is sur- 
prised that you should be so importun- 
ate about your little account. 

2834. Your " connection'' remind* 
you of certain obligations that you are 
under. 

2835. Your " connection" finds that 
your goods are not a bit better or 
cheaper than other tradesmen's. 

2836. Your "connection," after a 
little while, finds positive disparage- 
ment against your goods upon com- 
paring them with articles bought by a 
friend from another establishment. 

2837. Your " connection" conse- 
quently goes over to that other estab- 
lishment, too often forgetting to pay 
your " little account." 

2838. And when you venture to 
remonstrate, you lose your " connec- 
tion." 

2839. Integrity. The sole reliance 
of the shopkeeper should be in the in- 
tegrity of his transactions, and in the 
civility of his demeanour. He should 
make it the interest and the pleasure of 
the customer to come to his shop. If 
he does this, he will find the very best 
" connections," and so long as he con- 
tinues this system of business, they will 
never desert him. 

2840. Family Connections. It is al- 
ways creditable, but not always easy, 
for a man to stand well with his family. 
However creditable it may be to stand 
well with one's own kindred, this re- 
lationship should never be looked upon 
as an element of business. It is almost 
certain to fail. Your shop doors should 
be thrown open to everybody, and you 
should look to the world for your sup- 
port. 

2341. Religious Connections. Reng- 
ious connections very naturally form in 
small towns, where the mind and habiti 
of every man are known to his town* 



350 



A PROUD HEART IN A POOR BREAST, HE 8 MEIKI.E DOl.OHl TO KKLE. 



men. However much this may pre- 
vail, a man should never seek to make 
a show of religion the means of worldly 

? regress. If he does so, he will fail, 
'he truth Avill out at some time or the 
other, and he will be regarded as a 
black sheep. And having built up hi 
expectations, and regulated his expen 
diture with certain views of support 
he moment that support is withdrawn 
own the whole superstructure wil 
come. In these days of toleration a 
man may hold any religious opinions, i 
he do so becomingly. There should be 
no admixture of tea and theology, or o 
cheese and creed. The shop is the 
place wherein to practice the principle 
taught in the place of worship, but it is 
not the place to traffic in under the 
cloak of a religious reputation. 

2842. Political Conmotions. The 
same with politics. A good citizen 
will discharge his duty to his town and 
the State conscientiously. Let him 
allow to others the freedom of opinion 
which he claims for himself, and there 
are few who will seek to interfere with 
him. It is generally your bigot and 
zealot that suffer for opinion-sake, be- 
cause, being dogmatical, they bring 
persecution upon themselves. There 
are proper times when we have politi- 
cal duties to perform ; let them be dis- 
charged conscientiously. But in the 
place of business let not the shopkeeper 
weigh the opinions of other men, as he 
would his own wares, in brass scales. 
Politics is the business of the State ; 
fair dealing is the business of the shop- 
keeper ; and while we are the last to 
ay that man should not recognize and 
discharge' political duties, we do most 
earnestly assert that he should neither 
geek nor bestow custom for the promo- 
tion of party purposes. 

2843. Duties of a Shopkeeper. He 
should cheerfully render his best labour 
end knowledge to serve those who ap- 
proach his counter; and place confidence 
in his transactions : make himself alike 
to rich an 1 poor, but never resort to 
mean subt< *fuge and deception to gain 
approbation and support. He should 



be frugal in his expenditure, that, in 
deriving profits from trade, lie may not 
trespass unduly upon the interests ol 
others ; he should so hold the balance 
between man and man that he should 
feel nothing to reprove his conscience 
when the day comes for him to repose 
from his labours and live upon the 
fruits of his industry. Let the public 
discover such a man, and they will 
flock around him for their own sukes. 

2844. HINTS ox SCRUBBING FLOORS. 
After the white-washing, paint-clean- 
ing, and window-washing of each room 
has been completed, let the floor be 
scrubbed ; first seeing that it has been 
well swept. For this purpose have a 
small tub or bucket of warm water; an 
old saucer to hold a piece of brown 
soap, a large thick tow-linen floor-cloth, 
and a long-handled scrubbing-brush. 
Dip the whole of the floor-cloth into 
the water, and with it wet a portion of 
the floor. Next, rub some soap on the 
bristles of the brush, and scrub hard all 
over the wet place. Then dip your 
cloth into the water, and with it wash 
the suds off the floor. Wring the cloth, 
wet it again, and wipe the floor with it 
a second time. Lastly, wash the cloth 
about in the water, wring it as dry as 
possible, and give the floor a last and 
mrd wiping with it. Afterwards go on 
;o the next part of the floor, wet it, 
scrub it, wipe it three times, and pro- 
ceed in the same manner, a piece, at a 
ime, till you have gone over the whole 
hanging the dirty water for clean 
vhenever you find it necessary. For a 
arge room, fresh warm water will be 
equired four or five times in the course 
>f the scrubbing. 

When the floor has been scrubbed, 
eave the sashes raised while it is dry- 

n - 

For scouring common floors that aro 
r ery dirty, have by you an old tin pan 
with some grey sand in it ; and after 
oaping the brush, rub it on some sand 
Iso. 

2845. LAWS OF LANDLORD 
.ND TENANT LEASES. A lease 
s a conveyance of premises or land* 



A SCALD MAN'S HEAD IS SOON 



351 



for a specified term of years, at a year- 
ly rent, with defmite conditions as to 
alterations, repairs, payment of rent, 
forfeiture, &c. Being an instrument 
01 much importance, it should always 
be drawn by a respectable attorney, 
who will see that all the conditions in 
the interest of the lessee are fulfilled. 

2846. PRECAUTION In taking a 
lease, the tenant should carefully ex- 
amine the covenants, or if he take an 
underlease, he should ascertain the 
covenants of the original lease, other- 
wise, when too late, he may find him- 
self so restricted in his occupation 
that the premises may be wholly use- 
less for his purpose, or he may be in- 
volved in perpetual difficulties and an- 
noyances ; for instance, he may find 
himself restricted from making altera- 
tions convenient or necessary for his 
trade ; lie may find himself compelled 
to rebuild or pay rent in case of fire ; 
he may find himself subject to forfeit- 
ure of his lease or other penalty, if he 
should underlet or assign his interest, 
carry on some particular trade, &c. 

2847. COVENANTS. The covenants 
on the landlord's part are usually the 
granting of legal enjoyment of the 
premises to the lessee; the saving him 
harmless from all other claimants to 
title ; and also for future assurance. 
On the tenant's pnrt, they are usually 
*o pay the rent and taxes ; to keep the 

E remises in suitable repair; and to de- 
7er up possession when the term has 
expired. 

2848. RENT AND TAXES.- The 
lessee covenants to pay the rent and 
all taxes. 

2849. ASSIGNMENTS. Unless there 
be a covenant against assignment, a 
lease may be assigned ; that is, the 
whole interest of the lessee may be 
conveyed to another, or it may be un- 
derlet ; if, therefore, it is intended that 
it should not, it is proper to insert a 
covenant to restrain the lessee from as- 
signing or underletting. Tenants for 
terms of years may assign or underlet, 
kut tenants at will cannot. 

2850 REPAIRS -A tenant wh. cov- 



enants to keep a house in repair ie not 
answerable for its natural decay, but i& 
bound to keep it wind and water tight, 
so that it does not decay for want of 
cover. A lessee who covenants to pay 
rent and keep the premises in repair, 
is liable to pay the rent although the 
premises may be burned down. 

2851. NEGLECT OF REPAIRS BY 
LANDLORD If a landlord covenant* 
to repair and neglects to do so, the ten 
ant may do it and withhold so much of 
the rent. But it is advisable that no- 
tice thereof should be given by the 
tenant to the landlord, in the presence 
of a witness, prior to commencing the 
repairs. 

2852. RIGHT OF LANDLORD TO 
ENTER PREMISES. A Landlord may 
enter upon the premises (having 
previous notice), although not ex 

ed in the lease, for the purpose of 
viewing the state of the property. 

2853. TERMINATION OF LEA'SES. 
A tenant must deliver up possession at 
the expiration of the term (the lease 
being sufficient notice) or he will con- 
tinue liable to the rent as tenant by 
sufferance without any new contract; 
but if the landlord recognizes such 
tenancy by accepting a payment of rent 
after the lease has expired, such ac- 
ceptance will constitute a tenancy ; 
but previous to accepting a rent the 
landlord may bring his ejectment with 
out notice, for the lease having expir- 
ed, the tenant is a trespasser. A lease 
covenanted to be void, if the rent be 
not paid upon the day appointed, is 
good, unless the landlord make an en- 
try. 

2854. MARRIED WOMEN. Married 
women (unless the power is expressly

may, after his death, accept or reject 
it, in the same manner as an infant 
may, and is not bound by the cove- 
nants though she continues a tenant. 

2856. NOTICES. All notices of what- 
ever description relating to tenancies, 
should be in writing, and the person 
serving the said notice should write on 
the back thereof a memorandum of the 
date on which it was served, and should 
keep a copy of the said notice with a 
similar memorandum attached. 

2857. Houses are considered as let 
for the year, and the tenants are sub- 
ject to the laws affecting annual tenan- 
cies, unless there be an agreement in 
writing to the contrary. 

2858. Agreement for taking a House. 
Forms of agreement, or leases may 
be obtained at any law stationers in the 
city ; in the country they can be pro- 
cured from the booksellers. 

2859. Care should be taken to have 
inserted in the lease all terms of the 
contract between the parties. 

2860. Leases may be for a term of 
years, or for life, or" at will. 

2861. A lease for years is a lease for 
a certain number of years specified in 
the lease. 

2862. A lease for life is a lease for 
either the life of the tenant, or of some 
other person or persons. 

2863. A lease at will is where the 
tenantry exists only during the will of 
either of the parties. The statutes of 
most of the States provide that a parol 
lease for a longer term than one year 
shall operate only as a lease at will. 

2864. A lease by sufferance is when 
the tenant's lease has expired, and he 
remains in -possession. He is then ten- 
ant by the sufferance of the landlord. 

2865. THE ETIQUETTE OF 
COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. 
No subject in this work is more im- 
portant, and certainly none will be 
studied with as much attention, as that 
of the present section. Love is the 
universal passion, courtship is the most 
interesting avocation of human life, 
and marriage one of the great ends of 

' As ou v wives are not pur- 



chased as in China, nor stolen as in 
some parts of Africa, nor in general ne- 
gotiated for by parents, as in some coun- 
tries in Europe, but wooed and won by 
polite attentions, the manner in which 
a gentleman should behave towards la- 
dies is a matter of the greatest import- 
ance. Charms, filters, and talismans, 
are used no longer the only proper 
talismans are worth and accomplish- 
ments. (See 1211.) 

2866. How TO WIN THE FAVOR OF 
LADIES. To win the favor of ladies, 
dress and manner must never be neg- 
lected. Women look more to sense 
than to beauty, and a man shcvvs his 
sense, or his want of it, in every action 
of his life. When a young man first 
finds himself in the company of the 
other sex, he is seldom free from a de- 
gree of bashfulness, which makes him 
more awkward than he would other- 
wise appear, and he very often errs 
from real ignorance of what he should 
say or do. Though a proper feeling of 
respect and kindness, and a desire to 
be obliging and agreeable, will always 
be recognized and appreciated, there 
are certain forms very convenient to 
be understood. 

2867. HOW TO ADDRESS A LADY. 

We address a married lady, or widow, 
as Madam, or by name, as Missis or 
Mistress Jones. In answering a. ques- 
tion, we contract the Madam to ma'am 
as " yen, ma'am, no, ma 1 am, very fine 
day, ma'am.' 

2868. A single lady, of a certain age, 
may also be addressed as Madam. 

2869. A young lad\ . if the eldest of 
the family, unmarried, is entitled to the 
sirname, as Miss Smith, while her 
younger sisters are called Miss Mary, 
Miss Julia, &c. The term "Miss," 
used by itself, is very inelegant. 

2870. It is expected that gentlemen 
will, upon every proper occasion, ofl'er 
civilities to ladies of their acquaintance, 
and especially to those for whom they 
have a particular attachment. 

2871. A gentleman meeting a lady 
at an evening party, is struck with hel 
appearance. Ascertaining that she if

not engaged, which he may do from 
some acquaintance, he takes some op- 
portunity of saying, 

" Miss Ellen, will you honor me, by 
accepting my escort home, to-night?" 
or, 

" Miss Ellen, shall I have the pleas- 
ure of seeing you home ?" or, 

" Miss Ellen, make me happy by se- 
>cting me for your cavalier;" or, 

" Miss Ellen, shall I have the pleas- 
ure of protecting you ?" 

The last, of course, as the others, 
may be half in fun, for these little mat- 
ters do not require much seriousness. 
The lady replies, if engaged, 

" Excuse me, sir, I am already pro- 
vided for ;" or, pleasantly, 

" How unfortunate ! If you had been 
five minutes earlier, I might have avail- 
ed myself of your services ;' ' or, if dis- 
engaged, 

" Thank you, sir, I shall be obliged 
fur your attention;" or, 

" With pleasure, sir, if my company 
will pay you for your trouble ;" or, any 
other pleasant way of saying that she 
accepts, and is grateful for the atten- 
tion proffered to her. 

2872. The preliminaries settled, 
which should be as early as possible, 
his attention should be public. He 
should assist her in putting on her cloak 
and shawl, and offer her his arm before 
leaving the room. 

2873. PRELIMINARIES OF COURT- 

SHIP. 

2874. There is no reason why the 
passion of love should be wrapped up 
in mystery. It would prevent much 
and complicated misery in the world, 
if all young persons understood it. 

2875. According to the usages of 
society, it is the custom for the man to 
propose marriage, and for the female to 
refuse or accept the offer, as she may 
think fit. There ought to be a perfect 
freedom of the will in both parties. 

2876. When a young man admires a 
ady, and thinks her society necessary 
to his happiness, it is proper, before 
committing himself, or inducing the 
object of his admiration to do so, to ap- 



ply to her parents or guardians for per 
mission to address her; this is a be- 
coming mai k of respect, and the cir- 
cumstances must be very peculiar 
which would justify a deviation from 
this course. 

2877. Everything secret and unac- 
knowledged is to be avoided, as the 
reputation of a clandestine intercourse 
is always more or less injurious through 
life. The romance evaporates, but the 
memory of indiscretion suivives. 

2878. Young men frequently amuse 
themselves by playing with the feel- 
ings of young women. They visit them 
often, they walk with them, they pny 
them divers attentions, and after giving 
them an idea that they are attached to 
them, they either leave them, or, what 
is worse, never come to an explanation 
of their sentiments. This is to act the 
character of a dangler, a character 
truly dastardly and infamous. 

2879. How TO COMMENCE A COURT- 
SHIP.* A gentleman having met a 
lady at social parties, dance J with her 
at balls, accompanied her to and from 
church, may desire to become more 
intimately acquainted. In short, you 
wish to commence a formal courtship. 
This is a case for palpitations, but for- 
get not that " faint heart never won 
fair lady." What will you do ? Why, 
taking some good opportunity, say, 

"Miss Wilson, since I became ac- 
quainted with you, I have been every 
day more pleased with your society, 
and I hope you will allow me to enjoy 
more of it if you are not otherwise 
engaged, will you permit me to visit 
you on Sunday evening?" 

The lady will blush, no doubt she 
may tremble a little, but if your propo- 
sition is acceptable to her she may 
say, 

' I am grateful for your good opin- 
ion, and shall be happy to see you." 

Or if her friends have not been con- 
sulted, as they usually are before mat 
ters proceed so far, she may say : 

* See the "Lu\vs o! Love," published !>- 
Dit-.k & Fitzprerald. I'"ce 25 cent*

A BLITHE HEART MAKES A BLOMAND VISAGE. 



" I am sensible of your kindness, sir ; 
but I cannot consent to a private inter- 
view, without consulting my family.'' 

Or she may refuse altogether, and in 
such a case, should do so with every 
regard to the feelings of the gentleman, 
and, if engaged, should say frankly : 

" I shall be happy to see you at all 
times as a friend, but I am not at lib- 
"rty to grant a private interview." 

'2880. As, in all these affairs, the la- 
dy is the respondent, there is little ne- 
cessity for atiy directions in regard to 
her conduct, a a " Yes " ever so softly 
whispered, is a sufficient affirmative, 
and as her kindness of heart will in- 
duce her to soften as much as possible 
her " No." 

To tell a lady who has granted the 
preliminary favors, that you love her 
better than life, and to ask her to name 
the happy day, are matters of nerve, 
rather than form, and require no teach- 
ing. (See No. 320.) 

2881. LOVE LETTERS. 

2882. A gentleman is struck with 
the appearance of a lady, and is desir- 
ous of her acquaintance, but there are 
no means within his reach of obtaining 
an introduction, and he has no friends 
who are acquainted with herself or her 
family. In this dilemma there is no 
alternative but a letter. 

2883. There is, besides, a delicacy, a 
timidity, a nervousness in love, which 
makes men desire some naode of com- 
munication rather than the speech, 
which, in such cases, too often fails 
them. In short, there are reasons 
enough for writing but when the en- 
amored youth has set about penning a 
letter to the object of his passions, how 
difficult does he find it ! How many 
efforts does he make before he succeeds 
in writing- one to suit him ! 

2884. It may be doubted whether as 



ble being of whom he was enamored 
and it has been the same, so far as can 
be judged, in all the generations of tho 
world. 

2885. Affairs of the heart the deli 
cafe and interesting preliminaries ol 
marriage, are oftener settled by the 
pen than in any other manner. 

2886. To write the words legibly, tc 
ppell them correctly, to point them 
properly, to begin every sentence and 
every proper name with a capital let- 
ter, every one is supposed to learn at 
school. 

2887. To give examples of letters 
would be useless and absurd, as each 
particular case must necessarily require 
a widely different epistle, and the judg- 
ment and feelings of the party writing 
must be left to control both the style 
and substance of the letter. 

2888. For a love letter, good paper 
is indispensable. When it can be 
procured, that of costly quality, gold- 
edged, perfumed, or ornamented in the 
French style, may be properly need. 
The letter should be carefully en- 
veloped, and nicely sealed with a fancy 
wafer not a common one, of course, 
where any other can be had; or what 
is better, plain or fancy sealing- wax. 
As all persons are more or less governed 
by first impressions and externals, the 
whole affair should be as neat and 
elegant as possible. 

2889. Popping the Question. There 
is nothing more appalling to a modest 
and sensitive young man than asking 
the girl he loves to many him ; ana 
there are few who do not find theii 
moral courage tasked to the utmost. 
Many a man who would lead a forlorn 
hope, mount a breach, and " seek the 
bubble reputation e'en in the cannon's 
mouth," trembles at the idea of asking 
a woman the question which is to de-

ties of love; and there is probably no man | 2890. In a matter which men have 
living who has not at sometime written, always found so terrible, yet which, in 
or desired to write, some missive which one way or other, they have always 
explain his passions to the amia- i contrived in some awkward way to a 



A TRAVELLED MAX HATH LEAVE TO LIE. 



complish, it is not easy to give instruc- 
tions suited to every emergency. 

2891. A man naturally conforms to 
the disposition of the woman he ad- 
mires. If she be serious, he will 
approach the awful subject with due 
solemnity if gay and lively, he will 
make it an excellent joke if softly 
sentimental, he must woo her in a strain 
of high-wrought romance if severely 
practical, he relies upon straight-for- 
ward common sense. 

2892. There is one maxim of univer- 
sal application Never lose an oppor- 
tunity. What can a woman think of 
a lover who neglects one ? Women 
cannot make direct advances, but they 
use infinite tact in giving men occasions 
to make them. In every case, it is 
fair to presume that when a woman 
gives a man an opportunity, she ex- 
pects him to improve it ; and though he 
may tremble, and feel his pulses throb- 
bing and tingling through every limb ; 
though his heart is filling up his throat, 
and his tongue cleaves to the roof of 
his mouth, yet the awful question must 
be asked the fearful task accom- 
plished. 

2893. In the country, the lover is 
taking a romantic walk by moonlight, 
with the lady of his love talks of the 
beauty of the scenery, the harmony of 
nature, and exclaims, " Ah ! Julia, how 
happy would existence prove, if I al- 
ways had such a companion!" 

She sighs, and leans more fondly on 
the arm that tremblingly supports her. 

" My dearest Julia, be mine forever !" 
This is a settler, and the answer, 
ever so inaudible, " makes or undoes 
him quite." 

2894. " Take pity on a forlorn bach- 
elor," says another, in a manner either 
in jest or earnest," "marry me at 
once, and put me out of my misery.' 

" With all my heart, whenever you 
are ready," replies the laughing fair. 
A joke carried thus far is easily made 
earnest. 

2895. A point is often carried by 
taking a thing for granted. A gentle- 
uiiii paying part jular attentic - to 



a lady, says, " Well, Mary, when i 
the happy day ? " " What day, pray ? ' ' 
she asks, with a conscious blush. 

" Why, everybody knows that we 
are going to get married, and it might 
as well be one time as another ; so 
when shall it be?" 

Cornered in this fashion, there is no 
retreat. 

2896. " Jane, I love you ! Will you 
marry me ?" would be somewhat abrupt, 
and a simple, frankly given, " Yes ';" 
would be short and sweet, for an answer. 

" Ellen, one word from you would 
make me the happiest man in the 
universe!" 

" I should be cruel not to speak it, 
then, unless it is a very hard one." 

" It is a word of three letters, and 
answers the question. Will you have 
me ?" 

The lady of course says Yes, unless 
she happens fto prefer a word of only 
two letters, and answers No. 

And so this interesting and terrible 
process in practice, simple as it is in 
theory, is varied in a hundred ways, 
according to circumstances and the 
various dispositions. 

2897. One timid gentleman asks, 
" Have you any objection to change 
your name 1 ' ' And follows this up with 
another, which clenches its significance, 
" How would mine suit you ?" 

Another asks, " Will you tell me 
what I most wish to know?" 

" Yes, if I can." 

" The happy day when we shall bo 
married?" 

2898. Another says, " My Eliza, we 
must do what the world evidently ex 
pects we shall." 

" The world is very impertinent." 
" I know it but it can't be helped 

When shall I tell the parson to bt 

ready?" 

2899. As a general rule, a gentlemar 
never need be refused. Every woman 
except a heartless coquette, finds tho 
means of discouraging a man whom she 
does not intend to have, before the 
matter comes to the point of a declara- 
tion

A GENTLE HORSE SHOULD NOT BE OWER SAIK Sl'l'RRED. 



2900. Marriage Ceremony. Wed- 
dings are everywhere accompanied with 
some degree of ceremony, and are usu- 
ally considered as occasions of festiv- 
ity. 

2901. The preliminaries having been 
airanged by the contracting parties, and 
the lady having named the happy day, 
preparations are made for the wedding. 
Thse who belong to the Episcopal and 
Roman Catholic churches are usually 
married at church, in the morning, and 
by the prescribed forms. 

2902. In some cases there is a wed- 
ding-party given in the evening ; in 
others, the happy couple make a short 
wedding tour, and issue cards of invita- 
tion on their return. (See 2916.) 

2903. Among other denominations, 
the parties are married by a clergyman 
or magistrate ; and in the State of 
New York, marriage being considered 
by the law only a civil contract, it may 
be witnessed by any person. 

2904. Where a wedding is cele- 
brated in the usual forms, cards of in- 
vitation are issued, at least a week 
beforehand. The hour selected is 
usually eight o'clock, P. M. Wedding 
cake, wines, and other refreshments, 
are provided by the bride and her 
friends for the occasion. The bride is 
usually dressed in pure white she 
wears a white veil, and her head is 
crowned with a wreath of white flow- 
ers, usually artificial; and orange 
blossoms are preferred. She should 
wear no ornaments but such as her 
intended husband or her father may 
present her for the occasion certainly 
no gift, if any such were retained of 
any former sweetheart. 

2905. The bridernaidor bridesmaids, 
if there be two, are generally younger 
than the bride, and should also be 
dressed in white, but more simply. 
The bridegroom must be in full dress 
that is, he must wear a drees coat, 
which if he pleases, may be faced with 
white satin ; a white satin vest, black 
pantaloons, and dress boots or pumps, 
black silk stockings, and white kid 
ploves, and a wlrte cravat. The bride- 



groom is attended by one or two 
groomsmen, who should be dressed in 
a similar manner. 

2906. It is the duty of the bride- 
maids to assist in dressing the bride, 
and making the necessary preparations 
for the entertainment of the guests. 
The chief groomsman engages the 
clergyman or magistrate, and upon his 
arrival, introduces him to the bride and 
bridegroom, and the friends of the 
parties. 

2907. The invited guests, upon their 
arrival, are received as at other par- 
ties, and after visiting the dressing- 
rooms, and arranging their toilets, they 
proceed to the room where the cere- 
mony is to be performed. In some 
cases the marriage is performed before 
the arrival of the guests. 

2908. When the hour for the cere- 
mony has arrived, and all things are 
ready, the wedding-party, consisting of 
the happy couple, with the bridesmaids 
and groomsmen, walk into the room 
arm in arm; the groomsmen each at 
tending the bridesmaids, preceding the 
bride and bridegroom, and take their 
position at the head of the room, 
which is usually the end farthest from 
the entrance; the bride standing 
facing the assembly on the right of 
the bridegroom the bridesmaids taking 
their position at her right, and the 
groomsmen at the left of the bride- 
groom. 

2909. The principal groomsman now 
formally introduces the clergyman or 
magistrate to the bride and bridegroom, 
and he proceeds to perfonn the mar- 
riage ceremony: if a ring is to be used, 
the bridegroom procures a plain gold 
one, previously taking some means to 
have it of the proper size. (See 453.) 

2910. As soon as the ceremony is 
over, and the bridegroom has kissed 
the bride, the clergyman or magistrate 
shakes hands with the bride, saluting 
her by her newly-acquired name, as 

Mrs. , and wishes them joy 

prosperity, and happiness: the grooms- 
men and bridesmaids then do the same , 
and then the principal groomsmen

brings to them the other persons in the 
room, commencing with the parents 
and relatives of the parties, the bride's 
relatives having precedence, and ladies 
being accompanied by gentlemen. In 
this manner all present are expected 
to make their salutations and congratu- 
lations, first to the newly-married 
couple, and then to their parents and 
friends. And where the wedding cere- 
mony lias been performed before the 
arrival of the guests, they are received 
near the door, having, of course, first 
visited the dressing-rooms, and ai-e in- 
troduced in the same manner. The 
groomsman takes occasion, before the 
clergyman or magistrate leaves, to pri- 
vately thank him for his attendance, at 
the same time placing in his hand the 
marriage fee, which is wrapped up 
nicely in paper, and if more than the 
legal sum, as is frequently the case 
where the parties are wealthy, it is 
usually in gold. The bridegroom, of 
course, takes an early opportunity to re- 
imburse his groomsman for necessary 
expenses. 

2911. When the presentations and 
congratulations are over, that is, when 
the guests have arrived, the bridal 
party, which till now has kept its posi- 
tion, mingles with the rest of the com- 
pany, and joins in the dancing or other 
amusements. 

2912. The Bridal Chamber. The 
festivities should not be kept up too 
late ; and at the hour of retiring-, the 
bride is to be conducted to the bridal 
chamber by the bridesmaids, who assist 
her in her night toilet. The bride- 
groom upon receiving notice will retire, 
without farther attendance or cere- 
mony. 

2913. The practice of kissing- the 
bride is not so common as formerly, and 
in regard to this, the taste of the bride- 
groom may be consulted, as the rest of 
the company follow the example of 
the groomsman ; but the parents and 
very near relatives of the parties, of 
course act as affection prompts them. 

2914. The chamber frolics, such as 
tire whole company visiting the bride 



and bridegroom after they are in bed, 
which was done some years ago, even 
at the marriage of monarchs, and the 
custom of throwing the stocking, etc., 
are almost universally dispensed with. 

2915. WEDDING DRESS. It is impos- 
sible to lay down specific rules for dress, 
as fashions change, and tastes differ. 
The great art consists in selecting the 
style of dress the most becoming. 

2916. A stout person should adopt 
a different style from a thin person ; a 
tall one from a short one. Peculiari- 
ties of complexion, and form of face 
and figure, should be duly regarded ; 
and in these matters there is no better 
course than to call in the aid of any re- 
spectable milliner and cfcessmaker, who 
will be found ready to give the best 
advice. The bridegroom should simply 
appear in full drees, and should avoid 
everything eccentric and broad in style. 
The bridesmaids should always be made 
aware of the bride's dress before they 
choose their own, which should be de- 
termined by a proper harmony with 
the former. (See 2904.) 

2917. When the ceremony is per- 
formed according to the Protestant 
Episcopal service, the order of going 
to church is as follows : The BRIDR, 
accompanied by her father, not unfre- 
quently her mother, and uniformly by 
a bridesmaid, occupies theirs* carriage. 
The father hands out the bride, and 
leads her to the altar, the mother and 
the bridesmaid following. After them 
come the other bridesmaids, attended 
by the groomsmen, if there are more 
than one. 

2918. THE BRIDEGROOM occupies the 
last carriage, with the principal grooms- 
man, an intimate friend or brother. 
He follows, and stands facing the altar, 
with the bride at his left hand. The 
father places himself behind, with the 
mother, if she attends. 

2919. THE CHIEF BRIDEMAID oc- 
cupies a place on the left of the bride, u, 
hold her gloves and handkerchief, aiid 
flowers ; hei companions range them 
selves on the left. 

2920. Remember to take the riv

AT OPEN DOORS DOGS COME IN. 



with you. The fee to a clergyman is 
according to the fortune of the bride- 
groom ; and a trifle should be given to 
the sexton. 

2921. When the ceremony is con- 
cluded, the bride takes the groom 1 s arm, 
they enter their carriage, and proceed 
to the breakfast, every one else follow- 
ing. (See 3131.) 

2922. THE ORDER OF RETURN FROM 
CHURCH differs from the above only in 
the fact that the bride and bridegroom 
now ride together, the bride being on 
his left, and a bridesmaid, and a grooms- 
man, or the father of the bride, occu- 
pying the front seats of the carriage. 

'2923. THE WEDDING BREAKFAST 
having been already prepared, the wed- 
ding party return thereto. If a large 
party, the bride and bridegroom occupy 
seats in the centre of the long- table, 
and the two extremities should be pre- 
sided over by elderly relatives, if possi- 
ble one from each family. . Everybody 
should endeavour to make the occasion 
as happy as possible. One of the senior 
members of either the bride or bride- 
groom's family, should, some time 
before the breakfast has terminated, 
rise, and in a brief but graceful man- 
ner, propose the " Health and happiness 
of the wedded pair." It is much better 
to drink their healths together than 
separately; and, after a brief interval, 
the bridegroom should return thanks, 
which he may do without hesitation, 
since no one looks for a speech upon 
such an occasion. A few words, feel- 
ingly expressed, are all that is required. 
The breakfast generally concludes with 
the departure of the happy pair upon 
their wedding tour. 

2924. CARDS. With regard to send- 
ing out cards, as wedding tours are 
more extended than, in olden times, 
they are generally forwarded about a 
wwk or two previous to the return of 
the travellers. Plain silver-edged cards 
are now most fashionable, but questions 
relative to them ought to be referred to 
the engraver, as fashions change con- 
tinually. 

2925. RECEPTION. When the mar- 



ried pair have returned, and the day of 
reception arrives, wedding-en ko and 
wine are handed round, of which every 
one partakes, and each expresses some 
kindly wish for the newly-married 
couple. The bride ought not to receive 
visitors without a mother or sister, or 
some friend being present, not even if 
her husband is at home. Gentlemen 
who are in professions, cannot always 
await the arrival of visitors; when such 
is the case, some old friend of the 
family should represent him, and proffer 
an apology for his absence. 

2926. AFTER MARRIAGE. After 
marriage the bridal party usually travel 
for a week or two, upon their return , 
it is customary for the bride to be 
" at home" for a few days, to receive 
visits. The first four weeks after mar- 
riage constitute the honeymoon. 

You need not retain the whole of 
your previous acquaintance ; those only 
to whom you send cards are, after mar- 
riage, considered in the circle of your 
visiting acquaintance. The parents or 
friends of the bride usually send the 
cards to her connexion ; the bridegroom 
selects those persons among his former 
associates whom he wishes to retain as 
such. The cards are sometimes united 
by a silken cord, or white ribbon, to 
distinguish those of a newly-married 
pair from ordinary visitors ; but it is 
doubtful whether it be in good taste. 

A married lady may leave her own 
or her husband's card in returning a 
visit ; the latter only would bt5 adopted 
as a resource in the event '/f her not 
having her own with her. 

A lady will not say, " My Husband," 
except among intimates ; in every other 
case she should address him by his 
Christian name, calling him Mr. It is 
equally good ton, when alone with him 
to designate him by his Christian name 

2927. Cobbett, in his " Advice to a 
Husband," says, "I never could see 
the sense of its being a piece of etiquette 
a sort of mark of good breeding, t^> 
make it a rule that man and wife are 1105 
to sit side by side in a mixed company 
that if a party walk out, the wife is if

give her arm to some other than her 
husband; that if there be any other 
kind near, his is not to help to a seat 
or into a carriage. I never could see 
the sense of this ; but I have always 
Keen the nonsense of it plainly enough ; 
it is iu short, a piece of false refinement : 
it, being interpreted, means that so free 
are the parties from a liability to sus- 
picion, that each man can safely trust 
his wife with another man, and each 
woman her husband with another wo- 
man. But this piece of false refinement, 
like all others, overshoots its mark ; it 
says too much ; for it says that the par- 
ties have lewd thoughts in their mindg." 
This is the sensible view taken of 
part of the etiquette of marriage, by a 
man of extreme practical sense. 

2928. ACQUAINTANCES AFTER MAR- 
RIAGE. When a man marries, it is un- 
derstood that all former acquaintance- 
ship ends, unless he intimate a desire to 
renew it, by sending you his own and 
his wife's card, if near, or by letter, if 
distant. If this be neglected, be sure 
no further intercourse is desired. 

2929. In the first place A bachelor 
ie seldom very particular in the choice 
of his companions. So long as he is 
amused, he will associate freely enough 
with those whose morals and habits 
would point them out as highly dan- 
gerous persons to introduce into the 
sanctity of domestic life. 

Secondly A married man has the 
tastes of another to consult; and the 
friend of the husband may not be equally 
acceptable to the wife. 

Besides Newly-married people may 
wish to limit the circle of their friends, 
from praiseworthy motives of economy. 
When a man first "sets up" in the 
world, the burden of an extensive and 
ndiKcriminate acquaintance may be felt 
in various ways. Many have had cause 
to regret the weakness of mind which 
allowed them to plunge into a vortex of 
gaiety and expense they could ill afford, 
from which they have found it difficilt 
10 extricate themselves, and the effects 
of which have proved a serious evil to 
in after-life. 



When a man is about to be married, 
he usually gives a dinner to his bachelor 
friends ; which is understood to be their 
conge, unless he chooses to renew their 
acquamtance. 

2930. WEDDING CAKES. Four pounds 
of fine flour, well dried, four pounds ol 
fresh butter, two pounds of loaf sugar 
a quarter of a pound of mace pounded 
and sifted fine, the same of nutmegs 
To every pound of flour add eight eggs 
wash four pounds of currants, let them 
be well picked and dried before the fire; 
blanch a pound of sweet almonds, and 
cut them lengthwise very thin ; a pound 
of citron, one pound of candied orange, 
the same of candied lemon ; half a pint 
of brandy. When these are made ready 
work the butter with your hand to a 
cream, then beat in your sugar, a quarter 
of an hour, beat the whites of your egg-o 
to a very strong froth, mix them with 
your sugar and butter ; beat your yolks 
half an hour at least, and mix them 
with your cake; then put in your flour, 
mace and nutmeg, keep beating it well 
till your oven is ready pour in the 
brandy, and beat the currants and 
almonds lightly in. Tie three sheets 
of white paper round the bottom ot 
your hoop to keep it from running out, 
rub it well with butter, put in your 
cake, lay the sweetmeats in layers, with 
cake between each layer, and after it 
is risen and coloured cover it with paper 
before your oven is stopped up ; it will 
require three hours to bake properly. 

2931. ALMOND ICING FOR WEDDING 
CAKE. Beat the whites of three eggs 
to a strong froth, beat a pound of Jor- 
dan almonds very fine with rose water, 
mix them, with the eggs, lightly to- 
gether ; put in by degrees a pound of 
common loaf sugar in powder. When 
the cake is baked enough, take it out, 
and lay it on the icing ; then put it in 
to brown. 

2932. SUGAR ICING FOR WEDDING 
CAKE Beat two pounds of double- 
refined sugar with two ounces of fine 
starch, sift the whole through a gauze 
sieve, then beat the whites of four eggs 
with a knife upon a pewter dish for 



860

naif an hour; beat in your sugar a little 
at a time, or it will make the eggs fall, 
and injure the colour; when all the 
s;igar is put in, beat it half an hour 
longer, and then lay on your almond 
icing, spreading it even with a knife. 
If put on as soon as the cake comes 
out of the oven it will harden by the 
time the cake is cold. 

2933. TRUE TIME. Two kinds of 
time are used in Almanacs; clock or 
mean time in some, and apparent or 
sun time in others. Clock time is al- 
ways right, while sun time varies every 
day. People generally suppose it is 
twelve o'clock when the sun is due 
eouth, or at a properly made noon-mark. 
But this is a mistake. The sun is sel- 
dom on the meridian at twelve o'clock ; 
indeed this is the case only on four days 
of the year : namely, April 15, June 15, 
September 1, and December 24. The 
time when the sun is on the meridian or at 
the noon-mark is also given to the near- 
est second, for every day in the year. 
This affords a ready means of obtaining 
correct time and for setting a clock by 
using a noon-mark, adding or subtract- 
ing as the sun is slow or fast. 

Old-fashioned Almanacs, which use 
apparent time, give the rising and setting 
of the sun's centre, and make no allow- 
ance for the effect of refraction of the 
sun's rays by the atmosphere. The 
more modern and improved Almanacs, 
which use clock time, give the rising and 
setting of the sun' s upper limb, and duly 
allow for refraction. 

2934. TO ASCERTAIN THE LENGTH 
OF THE DAY AND NIGHT. At any 

time of the year, add 12 hours to the 
time of the sun's setting, and from the 
Bum subtract the time of rising, for the 
length of the day. Subtract the time of 
setting from 12 hours, and to the re- 
mainder add the time of rising next 
morning, for the length of the night. 
These rules are equally true for apparent 
time. 

2935. LEAP YEAR. Leap years are 
those that are exactly divisible by 4, and 
also by 400, and not by 100. The year 
1900 therefore, will not be a leap year. 



2936. DEVELOPMENT OF TIII LUNGS 
Much has been said and written upon 
diet, eating and drinking, but I do not 
recollect ever noticing a remark in any 
writer upon breathing, or the manner ol 
breathing. Multitudes, and especially 
ladies in easy circumstances, contract a 
vicious and destructive mode of breath- 
ing. They suppress their breathing, 
and contract the habit of short, quick 
breathing, not carrying the breath half 
way down the chest, and scarcely ex- 
panding the lower portions of the chest 
at all. Lacing the bottom of the chest 
also greatly increases this evil, and 
confirms a bad habit of breathing. 
Children that move about a great deal 
in the open air, and in no way laced, 
breathe deep and full to the bottom ot 
the chest, and every part of it. So 
also with most out-door labourers, and 
persons who take much exercise in the 
open air, because the lungs give us the 
power of action, and the more exercise 
we take, especially out of doors, the 
larger the lungs become, and are the less 
liable to disease. In all occupations 
that require standing, keep the person 
straight. If at table, let it be high, 
raised up nearly to the armpits, so as 
not to require you to stoop ; you will 
find the employment much easier not 
one half so fatiguing ; whilst the form 
of the chest and symmetry of the figure 
will remain perfect. 

2937. To PACK GLASS OR CHINA. 
Procure some soft straw or hay to 
pack them in, and if they are to be sent 
a long way, and are heavy, the hay or 
straw should be a little damp, which 
will prevent them slipping about. Let 
the largest and heaviest things be al- 
ways put undermost, in the box 01 
hamper. Let there be plenty of straw 
and pack the articles tight; but never 
attempt to pack up glass or china which 
is of much consequence, till it has been 
seen done by some one used to the job. 
The expense will be but trifling to have 
a person to do it who understands it, 
and the loss may be great if artic'.es oi 
such value are packed up in &a im- 
proper manner.

2938. HINTS oar THINGS FAMILIAR. 

What is carbonic acid gas? A gaif 
formed by the union of carbon and 
oxygen. It used to be called " fixed 
air." 

2939. Under what circumstances does 
carbon most readily unite with oxygen ? 
1. When its temperature is raised : 
thus, if carbon be red-hot, oxygen will 
most readily unite with it; and 2. 
When it forms part of the fluid blood. 

2940. Why do oxygen and carbon so 
readily unite in the blood ? Because 
the atoms of carbon are so loosely 
attracted by the other materials of the 
blood, that they unite very readily with 
the oxygen of the air inhaled. 

2941. Is carbonic acid wholesome ? 
No: it is fatal to animal life: and 
(whenever it is inhaled) acts like a 
narcotic poison producing drowsiness, 
which sometimes ends in death. 

2942. How can any one know if a 
place be infested with carbonic acid 
gae ? If a pit or well contain carbonic 
acid, a candle (let down into it) will be 
instantly extinguished. The rule, 
therefore, is this Where a candle will 
burn, a man can live; but what will 
extinguish a candle, will also destroy 
life. 

2943. Why does a miner lower a 
candle into a mine before he descends ? 
Because the candle will be extin- 
guished, if the mine contains carbonic 
acid gas ; but if the candle is not extin- 
guished, the mine is safe, and the man 
may fearlessly descend. 

2944. Why does a crowded room 
produce head-ache ? Because we 
breathe air vitiated by the crowd. 

2945. Why is the air of a room 
vitiated by a crowd? Because it is 
deprived of its due proportion of oxygen, 
and laden with carbonic acid. 

2946. How is the air of a room 
affected thus by a crowd ? The ele- 
ments of the air (inhaled by the breath) 
are separated in the lungs ; the oxygen 
is converted in the blood into carbonic 
acid ; and the carbonic acid (together 
with the nitrogen) is then thrown off 
by the breath into the room. 



2947. Is all the niti'ogen rejected by 
the lunge? Yes; all the nitroger ol 
the air is always expired. 

2948. Why is a crowded room un- 
wholesome ? Because the oxygen of 
the air is absorbed by the lungs : and 
carbonic acid gas (which is a noxioua 
poison) is substituted for it. 

2949. Mention the historical circum- 
stances, so well known in connexion 
with the " Black Hole of Calcutta." 
In the reign of George II. the Raja (or 
Prince) of Bengal marched suddenly to 
Calcutta, to drive the English from the 
country: as the attack was unexpected, 
the English were obliged to submit, and 
146 persons were taken prisoners. 

2950. What became of these prison- 
ers? They were driven into a place 
about eighteen feet square, and fifteen or 
sixteen feet in height, with only two 
small grated windows. 123 of the 
prisoners died in one night ; and (of the 
twenty-three who survived) the larger 
portion died of putrid fevers after they 
were liberated. 

2951. Why were 123 persons suffo- 
cated in a few hours, from confinement 
in this close, hot prison-hole ? Because 
the oxygen of the air was soon con- 
sumed by so many lungs, and its place 
supplied by carbonic acid, exhaled by 
the hot breath. 

2952. Why did the captives in the 
Black Hole die sleeping? 1. Because 
the absence of oxygen quickly affects 
the vital functions, depresses the ner- 
vous energies, and produces a lassitude 
which ends in death : and 2. The car- 
bonic acid gas (being a narcotic poison) 
produces drowsiness and death in those 
who inhale it. 

2953. Why are the jungles of Java 
and Hindostan so fatal to life? Be- 
cause vast quantities of carbonic acid 
are thrown off by decaying vegetables ; 
anc (as the wind cannot penetrate the 
thick brushwood to blow it away) it 
settles there, and destroys animal 
life. 

2954. Why do persons in a crowded 
church feel drowsy? 1. Because the 
crowded congregation inhale a larg 



362 



A MYRTLE STANDING AMONG NETTLES 



portion of the oxygen of the air which 
alone can sustain vitality and hea.thy* 
action: and 2. The air of the church is 
impregnated with carbonic acid gas, 
which (being a strong narcotic) pro 
duces drowsiness in those who inhale 
it. 

2955. Why do persons who are 
much in the open air, enjoy the best 
health ? Because the air they inhale is 
much 'more pure. 

2956. Why is country air more pure 
than the air in cities ? 1. Because 
there are fewer inhabitants to vitiate the 
air : 2. There are more trees to restore 
the equilibrium of the vitiated air: and 
3. The free circulation of air keeps it 
pure and wholesome ; (in the same way 
as running streams are pure and whole- 
some, while stagnant waters are the 
contrary.) 

2957. Why does the scantiness of a 
country population render the country 
air more pure ? Because the fewer 
the inhabitants the less carbonic acid 
will be exhaled; and thus country 
people inhale pure oxygen, instead of 
air impregnated with the narcotic 
poison, called carbonic acid gas. 

2958. Why do trees and flowers 
help to make country air wholesome ? 
1. Because trees and flowers absorb 
the carbonic acid generated by the 
lungs of animals, putrid substances, and 
other ncxious exhalations: and 2. Trees 
and flowers restore to the air the oxy- 
gen, which has been inhaled by man 
and other animals. 

2959. Why is the air of cHies less 
wholesome than country air? 1. Be- 
cause there are more inhabitants to 
vitiate the air : 2. The sewers, drains 
bins, and filth of a city, very greatly 
vitiate the air : 3. The streets and al 
leys prevent a free circulation : and 4 
Besides all this, there are fewer trees 
to absorb the excess of carbonic ack 
gas, and restore the equilibrium. 

2960. Why are persons who live in 
close rooms and crowded cities gener 
ally sickly ? Because the air thej 
breathe is not pure, but is (in the firs' 
place) defective in oxygen : and (in 



he second) impregnated with carbonic 
acid gas. 

2961. Where does the carbonic acid 
'f close rooms and cities come from? 
?rom the lungs of the inhabitants, the 
sewers, drains, and other like places, 
n which organic substances arc under- 
going decomposition. 

2962. What becomes of the carbonic 
acid of ciowded cities ? Some of it is 
absorbed by vegetables ; and the rest is 
jiown away by the wind, and diffused 
;hrough the whole volume of the air. 

2963. Does not this constant diffusion 
'f carbonic acid affect the purity of the 

\vhole air? No; because it is wafted 
ay the wind from place to place, and 
absorbed in its passage by the vegetable 
world. 

2964. What is choke damp? Car- 
bonic acid gas accumulated at the bot- 
tom of wells and pits, which renders 
them noxious, and often fatal to life. 

2965. SYNOPSIS OF ENGLISH 
GRAMMAR (See 1323) is so brief, that 
its substance may, if desirable, be com- 
mitted to memory in an hour or two. 
The uninitiated may acquire knowledge 
by it perusal ; it may serve to refresh 
the memory of some ; the accomplish- 
ed grammarian may glance, and pro- 
ceed. 

2966. " GRAMMAR is the art of speak- 
ing or writing a language according to 
established Rules. 

"It is divided into four parts: Or- 
thography, Etymology, Syntax and 
Prosody. 

2967. " ORTHOGRAPHY teaches 
the powers of the letters, and the art 
of combining them into syllables and 
words. 

2968. "The Letters of the English 
language are twenty-six in number ; ot 
which a, e, i, o, and u (and y in the 
middle or end of a word) are vowels, 
and the remainder consonants. 

2969. "ETYMOLOGY treats oi 
the different kinds of words, their mod- 
ifications and derivations. 

" There are nine sorts of words, 01 
parts of speech : the article, substan- 
tive or noun, adjective, prrtnoun, verb, 



DOES NOTWITHSTANDING RETAIN THE NAME OF A MYRTLE. 



36S 



adverb, preposition, conjunction, and 
interjection. 

"2970. There are in English but 
two Articles , and the. 

"A is styled the indefinite article, and 
is used in a vague sense to point out 
one single thing otherwise indetermin- 
ate ; as a mam. A is changed into an 
before a vowel or silent h ; as an acorn, 
an hour. The is styled the definite ar- 
ticle, and is used to point out some 
particular objects, as the man, the men. 

2971. "A 'substantive is the name of 
any thing that exists, or that we con- 
ceive. To substantives belong gender, 
number, and case. There are three 
genders, the masculine, feminine, and 
neuter. The masculine gender denotes 
animals of the male kind, as a man ; 
the feminine, animals of the female 
kind, as a woman ; and the neuter de- 
notes objects which are neither male 
nor female, as a house. There are 
three methods of distinguishing the 
genders : by different words, as king, 
queen , by a difference of termination, 
as abbot, abbess ; executor, executrix: or 
by a noun, pronoun, or adjective pre- 
fixed to the substantive ; as a man- 
servant, a maid-servant, &c. Substan- 
tives have two numbers, the singular 
and plural. The plural is generally 
formed by adding s to the singular; 
as a tree, trees ; but those ending in ch, 
sh, ss, or x, form their plural by the ad- 
dition of es. 

2972. " Nouns ending with a single 
/, or fe, generally change those letters 
into ve in the plural ; as leaf, leaves : 
those in y change into ies, as lady, la- 
dies ; unless there be another vowel in 
the syllable, in which case they form 
their plural by the addition of s ; as 
key, keys. Many substantives form 
their plurals irregularly, as die, dice. 

2973. " Some words have no plural ; 
as bread, wheat ; others no singular, ag 
riches, ashes; and some are alike in 
both numbers, as deer, sheep. 

" Substantives have three cases : the 
nominative, the possessive, and the ob- 
jective. The nominative simply ex- 
presses the name of a thing, and is 
16 



placed before the verb, when it affirms, 
and after the verb, when it asks a ques 
tion ; as Charles is ; Is Charles ? The 
possessive denotes the possession of 
something by another; as Charles' 
book. The objective is placed after the 
verb, and expresses the object of an 
action ; as Charles hurt William. 

2974 "An adjective is a word prefix- 
ed to a substantive to express its qual- 
ity ; as a wise man. Adjectives have 
no variation but that of the degrees of 
comparison, which are three ; the posi- 
tive, which simply expresses the quali- 
ty, as large; the comparative, which 
increases or lessens the quality of a 
thing, as larger; and the superlative, 
which increases or lessens the quality 
of a thing, in the highest or lowest de- 
gree, as largest. The comparative and 
superlative degrees are generally form- 
ed by adding er and est to the positive, 
when it is a word of one syllable, as 
old, older, oldest ; and by prefixing the 
word more or most, when the positive 
is a word of two or more syllables ; as 
correct, more correct, most correct. 
Some adjectives form their degrees of 
comparison irregularly; as good, bet- 
ter, best. 

2975. "A Pronoun is a word used 
instead of a Noun to avoid its too fre- 
quent repetition. Pronouns may be 
divided into personal, relative, and de- 
monstrative ; and they admit of gender, 
number, and case. 

2976. " There are five personal pro 
nouns ; I, thou, he, she, it ; with their 
plurals, we, you, and they. The rela- 
tive pronouns, which relate to some 
word or phrase going before them, are 
who, which, that and what. IVJio, which, 
and ichat, are also termed interroga- 
tives, when they are used in asking 
questions. The demonstrative pronouns 
point out the subjects to which they 
relate : they are this, that, these and 
those. 

2977. "A Verb expresses action, 
being, or Buffering ; as / write, I am, 1 
endure. Verbs are active, passive, and 
neuter. An active verb expresses an 
action and implies an agent who acts 



364 



IF WE WOULD AVOID A MISCHIEF, 



and an object acted upon ; as, I love 
Mary. A passive verb expresses an 
action endured or suffered by an object 
from some agent; as, Jane is taught 
by the master; and if distinguished 
from an active verb by having the ob- 
ject before, and the agent after it. A 
neuter verb merely expresses a state of 
existence ; as to sit. Auxiliary verbs 
are those, by the help of which other 
verbs are conjugated ; as, I do love, 
&o. 

ti978. "To verbs belong number, 
person, moods, and tenses. There are 
five moods ; the indicative, which sim- 
ply declares a thing, or asks a question ; 
as y he loves, does he love ? the impera- 
tive, which commands, exhorts, or en- 
treats; as, bring me that book, be atten- 
tive ; the infinitive, which expresses a 
thing in an unlimited manner, or with- 
out respect to number or person ; as, 
to speak; the subjunctive, which ex- 
presses a doubt, or contingency, and is 
preceded by a conjunction expressed 
or understood ; as, if I go ; and the 
potential, which implies possibility, 
power, will, or liberty ; as, it may rain. 

2979. " The Participle is a form of 
the verb, deriving its name from its 
participating in the qualities of the 
verb and adjective. There are three 
participles : the present, the perfect, and 
the compound perfect ; as loving, loved, 
having loved. 

2980. "An adverb is a word added 
to a verb, an adjective, or another ad- 
verb, to express some quality respect- 
ing it ; as, he speaks correctly ; a very 
excellent scholar ; he speaks very cor- 
rectly. 

2981. " Prepositions serve to connect 
words with one another, and to show 
the relation between them ; as, he 
went from London to taris. 

2982. "A Conjunction serves to con- 
nect words and sentences. Conjunc- 
tions are of two sorts ; the copulative 
and the disjunctive. The copulative is 
used to connect a sentence by express- 
ing an addition, supposition, or cause ; 
as, he and his brother are going to Lon- 
don. The disjunctive expresses an op- 



position of meaning ; as, they came 
with her, but went away without her. 

2983. "Interjections express some sud- 
den emotion ; as, Alas ! what htive I 
done ? 

2984. " Syntax is the arrangement 
of words into sentences. Sentences are 
of two kinds : simple, and compound / 
as. / write ; I write, while you play. 

2985. "A verb must agree with its 
nominative in number, and in person 
as, / write, he reads. 

2986. "A relative pronoun must 
agree with its antecedent in gender, 
number, and person ; as, thou, who 
lovest wisdom ; you, who speak truth. 

2987. "Two or more nouns, joined 
by a copulative conjunction, mjst have 
verbs, nouns, and pronouns agreeing 
with them in the plural number ; as, 
John and JamcF are industrious. 

2988. " Nouns connected by a dis- 
junctive conjunction have verbs, &c., 
agreeing with them in the singular 
number; as, John or James is at home. 

2989. " Prepositions always govern 
the objective case ; as, 7 spoke to him. 

2990. " Prosody teaches the correct 
sound and quantity of syllables^ and 
the laws of versification. 

2991. "The kind of feet employed 
in English poetry are three ; the Iam- 
bic, Trochaic, and Anapaestic. The 
Iambic consists of two syllables ; the 
first short, the second long; as, 'Se- 
cluded from domestic strife.' The 
Trochaic has the first syllable long, the 
second short ; ae, ' When our hearts 
are mourning.' The Anapccstic consists 
of two short syllables and one long one; 
as, ' May I govern my passion with 
absolute sway.' 

2992. PROPERTIES AND USES 
OF VEGETABLES. (See 1273.) 

2993. Catnip is a warm herb, of a 
diaphoretic or sweating nature.' 

2994. Pennyroyal is much the same, 
only more powerful. It retains a very 
powerful pungent oil. 

2995. Spearmint is punger t and hot 
but of an astringent nature. 

2996. Calamint is much the 
but not so strong. 



WE MUST NOT BE VERT KIND AND FAMILIAR WITH AN EVIL MAN.

2997. Hoarkound is very strengthen- 
ing to the lungs, and is somewhat of a 
pectoral. It is excellent in a cough, 
or stoppage in the stomach. 

2998. Everlasting, or Indian Posey, 
is a very balsamic herb healing and 
cooling, and excellent in salves or oint- 
ments. 

2999. Johnswort is much the same. 

3000. Pea Balm is a^cooling and 
sweating herb, and is good in fevers 
and inflammation s. 

3001. Chamomile is a great restora- 
tive to the lungs, and promotes perspi- 
ration. It is good in salves and oint- 
ments to take away swellings. 

3002. Mayweed is of a pectoral na- 
ture, and is good for a pain in the 
side. 

3003. Garden Coltsfoot is a great 
restorative to the lungs, and is good in 
syrups for coughs. 

3004. Melilot is good in salves and 
ointments for swellings and inflamma- 
tions. It is mollifying and cooling. 

3005. Sage is the greatest restora- 
tive to human nature of any herb that 
grows. Parsley is very cooling and 
softening. 

3006. Bloodroot is a very powerful 
emetic or purge ; steeped in spirits, it 
will serve for an emetic ; and boiled in 
fair water, It serves as a purge. 

3007. Mandrake root is an excellent 
physic, dried and pounded. 

3008. Cumfrey and Spikenard are so 
well known that they need no describ- 
ing. Wild Jcnton is a strong purge, 
boiled. 

3009. Elecampane is good in coughs, 
yet it is an astringent. 

3010. Crancsbill is an astringent, 
and excellent in cankers. 

301 1 Hliitcroot is of a physical na- 
ture, and is good to remove wind pent 
in the stomach, or part of the bowels. 

3012. Sassafras root is good for the 
blood likewise Sarsaparilla, Horse 
Radish, Burdock roots, Elder roots, 
Hop roots, and Wild Coltsfoot, are 
good as pectorals. 

3013. White and YeUow Pond LUy 
roots, the same. 



3014. Winter's Bark. This is the 
product of one of the largest trees on 
Terra del Fuego. It is good in dropsy 
and scurvy. (See 1714.) 

ART OF CONVERSATION. (See 864.) 

3015. The art of conversation, so 
essential to every one who wishes to 
mingle in society, can only be perfected 
by frequent intercourse with the polite 
yet great assistance may be derived by 
an intelligent person from the observa- 
tions below, and no important blunders 
can possibly be made if the rules here 
given be attended to. 

3016. Under favorable circum- 
stances, and among persons who know 
how to train a conversation, there are 
few if any amusements more grateful to 
the human mind. Every one knowa 
something which he is willing to tell, 
and which any other that he is in com- 
pany with wishes to know, or which if 
known to him, would be amusing 01 
useful. 

3017. To be a skilful conversa- 
tionist, one's eyes and ears should bs 
busy; nothing should escape his ob- 
servation. His memory should be a 
good one, and he should have a good- 
natured willingness to please and to be 
pleased. 

3018. It follows that all matter of 
offence in conversation should be avoid 
ed. The self-love of others is to be 
respected. Therefore, no one is toler- 
ated who makes himself the subject of 
his own commendation, nor who disre 
gards the feelings of those whom he 
addresses. 

3019. There is as much demand for 
politeness and civility in conversation 
as in any other department of social 
intercourse. One who rudely inter- 
rupts another, does much the same 
thing as though he should, when walk- 
ing with another, impertinently thrust 
himself before his companion, and stop 
his progress. 

3020. It was one of the maxims of 
a French philosopher, that " in con 
versation, confidence has a greatei 
share than wit. ' ' The maxim is erro- 
neous, although it is true that a fashion 



THEY CAN FIND MONEY FOIl MISCHIEF, 



able fool may attain to the small talk of 
which much of the conversation of 
society is composed, and his glib confi- 
dence may so far impose upon the 
superficial as to make this pass for 
wit: but it will not be received as such 
l>y that portion of society whose esteem 
is desirable. Good sense, sound and 
varied information, are as necessary as 
confidence to enable a man to converse 
well. 

3021. In addition, then, to the 
ordinary routine of education, make 
yourself acquainted with the passing 
circumstances of the day its politics, 
its parties, its amusements, its foibles, 
its customs, its literature, and at the 
present time I must also say its science. 
Some of these subjects may be the 
parent of much gossip and scandal ; 
still, a man moving in society as a gen- 
tleman, must be ignorant of nothing 
which relates thereto, or if he is, he 
must not appear to be. 

3022. Avoid a loud tone, particularly 
if speaking to ladies. By observing 
men of the world, you will perceive 
that their voices, as it were, involun- 
tarily assume a softness as they ad- 
dress the sex ; this is one of the most 
obvious proofs of an intimacy with 
good society. 

3023. Never attempt to occupy the 
attention of a company for a long time ; 
unless your conversation is very bril- 
liant it must become very tiresome. 

3024. The object of conversation is 
to entertain and amuse. To be agree- 
able, you must learn to be a good 
listener. A man who monopolizes a 
conversation is a bore, no matter how 
great hi6 knowledge. 

3025. Never get into a dispute. 
State your opinions, but do not argue 
them. " Do not contradict, and above 
all, never offend by correcting mistakes 
or inaccuracies of fact or expression. 

3026. Never lose temper never 
notice a slight never seem conscious 
of an affront, unless it is of a gross 
character, and then punish it at 



3027. You can never quarrel in the 



presence of ladies, but a personal in 
dignity may be avenged anywhere. 

3028. Never talk of people by hints 
slurs, inuendoes, and such mean de 
vices. If you have anything to say 
out with it. Nothing charms mor 
than candor, when united with good 
breeding. 

3029. Do not call people by theii 
names, in speaking to them. In speak 
ing of your own children, never 
"Master" and "Miss" themin speak- 
ing to other people of theirs, nevei 
neglect to do so. 

3030. It is very vulgar to talk in a 
loud tone, and indulge in horse-laughs 
Be very careful in speaking of subjects 
upon which you are not acquainted. 
Much is to be learned by confessing 
your ignorance nothing can be by 
pretending to knowledge which you do 
not possess. 

3031. Never tell long stories. Avoid 
all common slang phrases and pet 
words. 

3032. Of all things, don't attempt to 
be too fine. Use good honest English 
and common words for common 
things. If you speak of breeches, 
shirts, or petticoats, call them by their 
right names. The vulgarity is in avoid- 
ing them. 

3033. Be not partial to theorizing, or 
your conversation will assume the 
style of speech-making, which is intol- 
erable. 

3034. Badinage is pleasant, but it 
niay be dangerous ; stupid people may 
imagine you are ridiculing them, and 
the stupid are the most assiduous 

nemies. 

3035. Abjure punning ; it has been 
aptly designated "the wit of foels," 
gentlemen never pun. Punning is a 
sort of pot-house wit, which is quite 
ncompatible with good manners. Be 

not over-anxious to be considered 
wit recollect that in the society of 
wits, the wit of the company is likely 
to become the butt of the company. 

3036. It is a common error, that of 
adapting your conversation to the occu- 
pation of the person with whom you 



WHEN THEY CAN FIND NONE TO BUY CORN. 



367 



are conversing and to some persons it 
is exceeding!} offensive. 

3037 Thus introducing the subject 
of theology to a clergyman of law to 
a barrister, etc., etc., is in fact saying, 
" I have chosen the subject with which 
you are best acquainted all are alike 
to me." This is an assumption of 
superiority which is highly indecorous, 
and will ultimately insure punishment. 
A man of the world might not be of- 
fended, but he would instantly attribute 
the inadvertence to ignorance ; indeed, 
it generally arises from a desire to 
avoid the awkwardness of silence, and 
is a bungling way of throwing on an- 
other the onus of sustaining the con- 
versation, and of confessing your own 
incompetence ; but where one person 
will give you the benefit of this apol- 
ogy, a dozen will consider you imper- 
tinent. 

3038. A tattler is a most contempt- 
ible character, uniting in person either 
excessive ignorance, folly, and vanity, 
or the extremes of meanness, mischief, 
and malignity. 

3039. Women ordinarily slander 
more from vanity than vice men, from 
jealousy than malignity. 

3040. Without intending mischief, 
many persons do much by repeating 
conversation from one house to an- 
other. This gossiping is all but as 
injurious as scandal; for as you can 
never represent the exact circumstan- 
ces under which a fact may have been 
related, your version may give a totally 
different meaning to that which was 
intended by the original speaker: as 
observation proves that, in relating an 
anecdote or conversation, we give our 
impression of the meaning of the 
speaker, not his words ; thus, a miscon- 
ception of our own may produce infinite 
mischief. 

3041. A man should never permit 
himself to lose his temper in society, 
nor show that he has taken offence at 
any supposed slight it places him in a 
disadvantageous position betraying an 
absence of self-respect, :>r a* *.hs least 
-of self-possession. 



3042. If a "puppy" adopt a disa 
greeable tone of voice, or offensive 
manner toward you, never resent it ai 
the time, and, above all, do not adopt 
the same style in your conversation 
with him ; appear not to notice it, and 
generally it will be discontinued, as it 
will be seen that it has failed in its ob- 
ject, besides which you save your 
temper. 

3043. If, upon the entrance of a vi 
itor, you continue a conversation begun 
before, you should always explain the 
subject to the new-comer. 

3044. There cannot be a custom 
more vulgar or offensive than that of 
taking a person aside to whisper in a 
room with company, yet this rudeness 
is of frequent occurrence and that 
with persons who ought to know bet- 
ter. 

3045. Conversation should be studied 
as an art. Style in conversation is as 
important, and as capable of* cultiva- 
tion, as style in writing. The manner 
of saying things is what gives them 
their value. 

3046. Avoid provincialisms in your 
language and pronunciation. Webstei 
is the standard for pronouncing in the 
best society in the United States. 

3047. Swearing, which formerly per 
vaded every rank of society, is now 
to be chiefly found in a very lew and 
uninstructed class ; it is, in fact, a vul- 
gar and proscribed mode of speech. 
Nevertheless, it is still used occasion- 
ally by persons of no humble rank, es- 
pecially by the young, though chiefly 
for the purpose of giving an emphasis 
to speech, or perhaps simply to give 
token of a redundancy of spirits, and a 
high state of excitement. To those 
who are guilty of it, for these reasons, 
it is only necessary to point out, that no 
well-informed person can be at the 
least loss, with the genuine words of 
the English language, to express all 
legitimate ideas and feelings ; and that 
to use either profane or slang words is, 
at the least, the indication of a low 
taste and inferior understanding. A 
direct, pure, manly use of our native 



868 



THOUGH THOU HAST NEVER SO MANY COUNSELLORS, 



language is an object which all may 
cultivate in a greater or less degree ; 
and we have invariably observed, 
through life, that the most virtuous 
persons are the most exempt from the 
use of mean and ridiculous phraseology 
and monkey tricks of all kinds. 

3048. Meeting an acquaintance 
among strangers in the street, or a 
coffee-house never address him by 
namo. It is vulgar and annoying. 

304iJ. Never tattle nor repeat in 
one society any scandal or personal 
matter you hear in another. Give your 
own opinion of people if you please, 
but never repeat that of others. 

3050. You are not required to de- 
fend your friends in company, unless 
the conversation is addressed to you ; 
but you may correct a statement of 
fact, if you know it to be wrong. 

3051. Do not call people by their 
names, in speaking to them. In speak- 
ing of ylmr own children, never " Mas- 
ter" and "Miss" them in speaking 
to other people of theirs, never neglect 
to do so. (See 1338.) 

3052. DOMESTIC MANIPULA- 
TION. 

3053. Under the head of Domestic 
Manipulation, we propose giving a se- 
ries of articles on the numerous and 
essential manual operations that are 
constantly being required in every 
family, and which, whether they are 
well or ill done, must of necessity be 
performed. 

3054. The term Domestic Manipu- 
lation, employed in the widest sense, 
would hielud'e all the manual opera- 
tions required in a house, but we pro- 
pose to limit it to such as partake in a 
slight degree of a chemical or other 
scientific character ; thus the opera- 
tions of Filtering, Decanting, Weigh- 
ing, Measuring, Bottling, Corking, Un- 
stoppering, Pounding, Boiling, &c., 
&c.. will be included; whilst Dusting, 
"Washing, and Scrubbing, though no 
Jess, in strictness, manipulations, will 
be passed over in silence. 

3055. In this, our first article, we 
propose treating of the manipulations 



connected with BOTTLES AND DECAN- 
TERS, &c., under the following heads 
Cleaning, Drying, Corking, Tying 
Down, Stoppering, and Tnstoppeiing. 

3056. Cleaning. Perhaps uo more 
effectual and easy mode of cleaning 
wine and beer bottles can be recom- 
mended than that commonly adopted, 
viz., the use of small shot and water, 
in the case of old port wine bottles, 
however, it often occurs that the me- 
chanical action of the shot is unable to 
remove the hardened crust from the 
interior ; a small quantity of pearlash 
or soda, or still better, the washing 
liquids described in another page, add- 
ed to the water, will soften the crust 
sufficiently to permit its easy removal ; 
there is, however, one objection to the 
use of shot for the purpose of cleaning 
bottles ; unless due care be taken, by 
the violence of the shaking, it ofteu 
happens that several become firmly 
M edged between the bottom and sides 
of the bottles, and are not removed by 
the subsequent rinsing- with clean wa- 
ter, and if the bottles are used for acid 
wines or other liquids (almost all our 
home-made wines contain a considera- 
ble portion of free acid), the shots are 
slowly dissolved ; and from the metal- 
lic arsenic which they contain, as well 
as from the lead itself, the liquid is 
rendered poisonous. This effect may 
be readily guarded against by removing 
any shots which may have become fix- 
ed, by a stiff wire slightly hooked at 
the end. (See 2500.) 

3057. Decanters are formed of flint 
glass, which is much softer and more 
readily scratched than the common 
kinds, they require therefore a less 
rough treatment ; in general, warm 
(not boiling) water, with the addition 
of a few pieces of coarse brown paper, 
and if requisite a little soda, will be 
found effectual; should greater force 
be required, a small portion of tow 
wrapped around the notched end of a 
moderately stiff wire, and used with a 
little strong soda, will be found suffi- 
cient. Sand or ashes should never be 
employed in cleaning decanters, a

tfiey roughen and totally disfigure the 
brilliant surface of the glass. 

3058. Drying. It is scarcely neces- 
sary to speak of the advantages of be- 
ing able to dry thoroughly both decan- 
ters and common bottles ; if the former, 
after having been cleansed, are put 
away wet, they become musty; and 
many liquids ar* much injured by being 
put 'into wet bottles. Some of our 
readers have doubtless experienced 
the inefficiency of the ordinary means 
for drying decanters, &c., after drain- 
ing for some days they still remain 
damp, and if placed near a fire the 
warmth merely drives the vapour to 
the colder part of the vessel ; they 
may, however, be readily and quickly 
dried after draining, by making them 
slightly warm and blowing in fresh air 
with a pair of bellows, which rapidly 
carries out the damp vapour, and 
leaves the vessel perfectly dry. If 
bellows are not at hand, the damp air 
may be drawn out (not blown) with 
the mouth, assisted by a tube suffi- 
ciently long to reach nearly to the bot- 
tom of the decanter; in the laboratory 
a piece of glass tube is usually taken, 
being always at hand, but for domestic 
use a piece of paper may be rolled up 
BO as to form an extemporaneous and 
effectual substitute. 

3059. Corking. Little can be said 
with regard to the corking of bottles, 
beyond stating the fact that cheap bad 
corks are always dear ; the best corks 
are soft, velvety, and free from large 
pores ; if squeezed they become more 
elastic and fit more closely. If good 
corks are used of sufficiently large size 
to be extracted without the corkscrew, 
they may be employed many times in 
succession, especially if they are soaked 
in boiling water after, which restores 
them to their original shape, and re- 
news their elasticity. 

3060. Tying Down. The operation 
of tying down corks merits a long no- 
tice, as without it many effervescent 
wines and liquids could not be preserv- 
ed. The most common mode of fast- 

" vn'ks, i with trie ginger- 



beer knot, which is thus made . First 
the loop is formed as in Fig. 1, then 





Fig. 2. 

that part of the string which passes 
across the loop is placed on the top of 
the cork, and the loop itself passed 
down around the neck of the bottle, 
and by pulling the ends of the cord is 
made tight beneath the 
rim ; the ends of the 
string are finally brought 
up, and tied either in a 
double knot, or in a 
bow on the top of the Fig 2. 
cork. When ginger-beer is made at 
home it will be found most advanta- 
geous to use the best corks, and to tie 
them down with a bow, when both 
c irks and strings may be made use of 
repeatedly. 

3061. For effervescent wines, such as 
champagne, gooseberry, &c., which re- 
quire to be kept a longer time, and are 
more valuable, a securer knot is desir- 
able, which may be made thus : A loop 




Fig. 3. 

as in Fig. 2 is first formed, and the 
lower end is then turned upwards and 
carried behind the loop, as shown in 
Fig. 3 ; it is then pulled through the 




Fig. 4. 
loop as in Fig. 4 and in this state if 



370 



GO DOWN THE LADDER WHEN" THOU MARRIEST A WIFE, 



put over the neck of the bottle ; the 
part a being on one side, and the two 
parts of the loop on the other ; on pull- 
ing the two ends the whole becomes 
tight round the neck, and the ends, 
which should be quite opposite, are to 
be brought up ov%r the cork, twice 




Fig. 5. 

twisted, as in Fig. 5, and then tied in 

a single knot. 

306*2. Stoppering. The stoppering 
of bottles is an operation usually per- 
formed by the makers ; it may, however, 
oe useful to know that badly-fitting 
stoppers may be readily fitted by re- 
grinding; this is done by dipping the 
stopper in a mixture of fine sand, or 
still better, emery and water, replacing 
it, and turning it backwards and for 
wards with a slight pressure ; fresh 
sand must be applied from time to time. 
When the fitting is exact, so that the 
stopper turns freely without shaking, 
the whole may be finished off by using 
a little fine emery and oil. 

3063. Unstoppering. This operation 
is much more likely to be required than 
the one last described, for the stoppers 
of decanters, smelling bottles, &c,, from 
various causes, frequently become fixed, 
and many are the fractures both of bot- 
tles and stoppers, caused by the misdi- 
rected efforts to remove them. In treat- 
ing of the various means that may be 
employed, we will mention that in the 
order in which they should be tried, 
beginning with the simple and more 
easy, and passing on to those which are 
more effectual, and at the samo time, 
Unfortunately, mo-~? dangerous. The 



first method, then, that should be tried, 
is to press the stopper upwards with 
the fore-finger and thumb of the left 
hand (the other fingers holding the 
neck of the bottle), and at the same 
time giving the stopper a succession of 
short, sharp, light taps, with the wooden 
handle of a chisel, knife, or small ham- 
mer ; care must be taken not to strike 
the stopper with sufficient force to break 
it, and it should be borne in mind that 
it is not the force of the blow, but the 
vibration, or jar, which is effectual in 
loosening it ; should this plan be found 
ineffectual after a short trial, it may 
probably be from the stopper being 
cemented by some substance, such as 
the dried sugar of a sweet wine. In 
such cases we should endeavour to dis- 
solve the cement by a suitable solvent, 
which should be placed in the groove 
between the stopper and the bottle , 
thus, if the stopper is cemented with 
sugar, gum, or salt, water may be used ; 
in many circumstances, oil is advan- 
tageous, or spirit, or even strong acid 
may be used ; whatever liquid is em- 
ployed it should be allowed to remain 
some days, being renewed if requisite, 
and th tapping, &c., should be again 
had recWse to. (See 254.) 

3064. Should these methods fail, a 
piece of cloth may be dipped in very hot 
water and wrapped round the neck of 
the bottle, when the heat causes the 
expansion of the glass, and if the stop- 
per be tapped or twisted before the 
heat has had time to enlarge it, its re 
moval may be effected ; this operation 
must necessarily be a quick one, for if 
the stopper is heated and enlarged, as 
well as the bottle, it is obvious that no 
benefit will result. In the laboratory 
it is often customary to heat the bottle, 
not by a strip of cloth dipped in hot 
water, but by turning it rapidly over 
the flame of a lamp ; in this way there 
is more danger of cracking the bottle, 
and the plan is not to be recommended 
in genera], although employed with 
considerable success by those who, like 
operative chemists, are constantly in 
the habit of applying heat to glass ve-

371 



eels : it will at once be seen that the 
plan is fraught with great danger if ap- 
plied to bottles containing inflammable 
liquids, as spirits, &c. 

3065. The most effectual mode of 
} removing stoppers, especially those of 
mall bottles, such as smelling-bottles, 
remains to be described. Take a piece 
of strong cord, about a yard or four feet 
in length, double it at the middle, and 
tie a knot (Fig. 6, J) BO as to form a 




Fig. 6. 

loop (a) of about four inches in length 
at the doubled end, bring the knot close 
to one side of the stopper, and tie the 
ends tightly together on the opposite 
Bide, as at Fig. 7, (e.) so as to fasten the 




Fig. 7. 

Btring securely round the neck of the 
Btopper; now pass one of the ends 
through the loop (a), and then tie it 
firmly to the other end ; the doubled 
cord is then to be placed over a bar or 
other support, then if the bottle is sur- 
rounded by a cloth to prevent accidents 
in case of fracture, and pulled down- 
wards with a jerk, the force of which is 
gradually increased, it will be found 
that in a short time the stopper is 
Jrberated. Two precautions are re- 
quisite, one is, that the strain on both 
,Bides of the stopper is equal; the other, 
that care be taken that when the stop- 
per is liberated, it is not dashed by the 
rebound against any hard substance, 
which would c*ase its fracture.

3066. CUTTING, GRINDING, AND 
WRITING ON GLASS. We have des- 
cribed the most advantageous modes of 
extracting fixed stoppers from decan- 
ters, &c. It is possible that some of 
our readers may have followed our ad- 
vice sufficiently well to have succeeded, 
in cracking the necks of their decanters. 
In case any should have been so unfor- 
tunate, or rather we would say, if we 
were quite sure we were not addressing 
ladies so clumsy, let them not despair ; 
dexterity in manipulation comes by 
practice ; and as no evil is without a 
remedy, we will next consider what 
can be done with the broken decanter. 

3067. Unless it is cracked down to 
the bottom, it may be cut off and con- 
verted into a handsome sugar basin ; or 
if not high enough for that purpose, will 
serve for a pickle-dish, or a flower- 
stand, &c. ; and in the same way, a 
tumbler broken in the upper part will 
furnish an elegant salt-celler, or service- 
able soap-dish; and even common bot- 
tles, if sufficiently stout, may be made 
into useful jars, instead of being con- 
signed to the dust-heap. 

3068. The operation of cutting glass, 
consists in leading a crack in the re- 
quired direction ; this is readily done 
by a hot iron rod, a piece of pointed 
burning charcoal, or, what is still better, 
a burning pastile which is somewhat 
similar in its composition to those used 
for fumigation; and which latter, al- 
though rather expensive, and inconve- 
nient from their shape, may be applied 
for the purpose. 

3069. When the operation of cutting 
up glass vessels into useful forms is 
much had recourse to, pastiles are pre- 
pared for the purpose, being superior to 
a heated iron rod, as they continue to 
burn and retain their heat, whilst the 
latter requires to be re-heated, if the 
crack has to be led any considerable 
distance. 

3070. Pastiles are readily made by 
rubbing up half an ounce of powdered 
gum tragacanth with water, so as to 
form a mucilage about as thick as or 
dinary starch ; this should be allowed

bie quantity of proof spirit; after mix 
ing them tog-ether in a mortar, as much 
powdered charcoal should be added as 
will form a stiff paste, and the whole 
veil worked together, rolled into sticks 
the size of a common black lead pencil, 
and dried. 

3071. As thus prepared, they should 
be free from cracks, and solid through- 
out ; and on being ignited at the end, 
they will burn steadily away to a point. 
If an iron rod is used, it should be 
nearly as stout as the little finger, and 
taper at the end for an inch and a half 
to a blunt point. 

3072. Before commencing the line 
along which it is wished to divide the 
glass, it should be marked with a pen 
and ink, and allowed to dry, when the 
iron, heated to dull redness, or the 
lighted extremity of the pastile, should 
be brought to the end of a crack, being 
held in a slanting direction with regard 
to the glass, as shown in the cut, and 
slowly moved in an oblique direction 
towards the line; the crack will be 
found to follow the heated point, and 
may be thus led as required, even pas- 
sing over parts varying very considera- 
bly in thickness, as in the case of the 
flutings on a cut decanter ; but it can- 
not, with certainty, be made to pass 




pudJenly from a very thin to a very 
ttout part, or the reverse : thus it may 
be led round the sides of a tumbler, but 
could hardly be made to pass down 
one aids, across the bottom, and up the 



other. The rapidity with which the 
operation is performed, depends upon 
the heat of the iron or pastile ; if the 
former is very hot, or the latter made 
to burn more vividly, by blowing upon 
it, the operation is quickened, but it is 
not performed with so much certainty, ' 
as the crack may pass on further than 
is desirable : care should be taken not 
to lead the crack too near the edge of 
the vessel, or to another crack, as in 
that case it is apt to leave the proper 
oj^rse, and fly suddenly to the edge, 
to which an inexperienced operator 
should not attempt to go nearer than 
half an inch. 

3073. It sometimes occurs that a 
piece is broken out of a glass, without 
leaving any crack to commence from ; 
in this case, one must be made, by 
heating the edge (one formed by the 
fracture, if possible), with the iron or 
pastile, and instantly applying the 
moistened finger. 

3074. When a crack is formed, which 
may be used as described above, care 
must be taken not to cause an extensive 
fracture, which may run across the in- 
tended line of division; this may be 
avoided by commencing the crack at 
some distance from the line, and by 
applying the heated point for a very 
short time, preferring to make two or 
three unsuccessful attempts rather 
than to hasten the operation, and risk 
the destruction of the glass. 

3075. When a glass vessel has been 
thus divided, the edges are sufficiently 
sharp to cut the fingers in handling, 
and are usually wavy; it is therefore 
necessary to make them smooth and 
even. 

3076. The most ready way of doing 
this i, by grinding them down on a flat 
sandstone, or ordinary paving-stone, 
with a little sharp sand or emery, and 
water, taking care to move the glass in 
a circular direction, and not merely 
Backwards and forwards ; the smooth- 
ness of the whole will depend entirely 
on that of the stone, and on the fineness 
>f the sand or emery employed. If, 
*rrra any irregularity, there is mucb

glass to grind aw;ty, it is preferable to 
commence with sand, and finish with 
emery on a smooth stone ; if the edges 
are not thus ground down, they should 
have the sharp angles, which are really 
dangerous, removed by a fine file, which 
should be moistened with oil of turpen- 
tine or camphine, as this liquid has an 
extraordinary effect In increasing the 
action of the file upon the glass, and at 
the same time, protecting the steel in- 
strument from wear. 

3077. Advantageous as cracks are in 
glass vessels whenever we wish to 
separate them into two parts, they are 
by no means desirable under other cir- 
cumstances ; and it is as important to 
know how to stop their progress, as to 
lead them forward. This is readily 
done in stout glass, by drilling a hole 
about half an inch in advance of the 
crack, which gradually passes on into 
it, and then its farther progress is ar- 
rested. 

3078. Holes may be drilled in glass 
with a common drill and bow, the 
place being first marked with a file or 
flint, and the drill point kept w T et with 
oil of turpentine. (It is hardly neces- 
sary to state, that a crack existing in 
the neck of a decanter, and liable to 
be forced apart with the stopper, could 
not be arrested in its progress by such 
means). If necessary, a little emery 
powder may be used with the oil of 
turpentine ; and after the operation, 
the hole must be filled up with some 
cement ; if the vessel is to be used for 
holding liquids, a little fresh slaked 
lime, moistened with equal* parts of 
white of egg and water, may be used 
for this purpose. 

3079. The grinding of glass on a flat 
stone with sand or emery, and water, 
is often used in making a bottle stand 
teadily; and by its means a wine- 
glass with a broken foot may be turned 
to g-x)d account ; for if as much of the 
tern a possible is knocked off, by 
Itriking it with f Vi back of a knife, the 
remainder may i>e ground away so that 
the vessel will staua. 

3080 Ov of the most important 



Domestic Manipulations, although one 
of the most simple and easy, "is the 
labelling of glass vessels. It is not too 
much to afh'rm, that scores of lives 
might have been saved if this had been 
attended to; in cases of accidental 
poisoning, we usually find that the 
victim has drunk from some bottle 
which has been put away without a 
hibel ; and that thus corrosive liquid 
used for cleaning, or some poisonous 
lotion, has been inadvertently swal- 
lowed. 

3081. One of the most ivady modes 
of labelling glass, and other objects, 
consists of having at hand a sheet of 
paper which has had spread on one 
side some gum water, mixed w r ith half 
its weight of coarse brown sugar, and 
allowed to dry ; this may be cut into 
labels, written on, and readily attached 
to glass by moistening with the tongue ; 
the white margin of a sheet of postage 
stamps answers the purpose very well. 
If, however, acid liquids are used, or 
the vessel is placed in a damp situation, 
as a cellar, other means must be had 
recourse to. 

3082. With a little practice, it is 
easy to write in a legible, though not 
very conspicuous manner, on glass, with 
a gun- flint, or with the sharp-edged 
fragment of common flint. In the 
laboratory, what is called a writing 
diamond is used for this purpose ; this 
should not be confounded with a 
glazier's diamond, which is used for 
dividing, and not scratching glass. 

3083. We would here caution our 
readers against writing OTI glass with a 
diamond ring, &c., as the practice in- 
jures the jewel considerably ; in the 
glazier's diamond, the natural edges of 
the crystal are used, which are not 
liable to injury as are the cut angles of 
a brilliant. 

3084. When glass vessels are exposed 
to damp, the best mode of writing cs 
them is to prepare an ink for the pur- 
pose, by mixing the common cheap 
varnish, called Brunswick black, with 
half its weight of oil of turpentine. o+ 
what is the s<ne thing, in a purer stafc*

eamphine ; this should bo kept in a 
closely-corked bottle, and used with a 
broad-nibbed quill pen ; it soon dries, and 
though pale, is very distinct, and almost 
imperishable. If it is required much 
darker, about a quarter of an hour after 
it has been done, a little lamp black 
should be rubbed over it, with cotton 
or wadding, when it immediately be- 
comes as black as common ink, and 
resists damp, and rubbing or wiping 
with either wet or dry cloths, for a very 
long time ; the same ink is equally ad- 
vantageous for use with white earthen- 
ware ; and although we have never had 
occasion to use such a mixture, there is 
no doubt that a little whiting mixed 
thin, with any common varnish, would 
furnish an equally useful ink for writ- 
ing on black bottles. 

3085. DECANTING, STRAIN- 
ING,AND FILTERING OF 

LIQUIDS. (See 2668.) 
THE decanting of liquids is, under 
ordinary circumstances, an operation 
sufficiently simple to require no ex- 
planation ; but the ease and certainty 
with which it can be performed, de- 
pend entirely upon the form of the vessel 
from which the liquid is poured. The 
adhesion existing between liquids and 
solids gives rise to a tendency in the 
former to run down the outside of the 
vessel, and if the latter is nearly full, 
or very large iu circumference, or the 
sides approach the perpendicular di- 
rection, this accident almost always 
occurs. The difficulty of returning a 
glass of wine to the decanter, or of 
pouring from one full tumbler into an- 
other, are well known examples of 
this inconvenience. 

3086. Advantage may, however, be 
taken of the adhesion of liquids to 
solids, and by it the former may be led 
into the required direction. This can- 
not be better illustrated than by a de- 
scription of the means by which a glass 
of wine may be returned, without 
spilling, to the decanter. If a tea- 
spoon ie dipped into the wine, so as to 
become wetted with it, and then held 



perpendicularly with the bowl down- 
wards, and the point over, but not 
touching, the entrance into the de- 
canter, and the edge of the glass be 
made to touch the back of the spoon, 
it will be found, on inclining the former, 
that the w r ine, having a perpendicular 
solid body to adhere to and run down, 
will do so in preference to trickling 
along the oblique outer surface of the 
wineglass ; and iu this mode a liquid 
may be poured steadily out of any 
similar vessel, with so httle disturbance 
as not to agitate aay sediment tha*. 
may exist in it. 

In the laboratory of the chemist, a 
piece of glass rod in usually employed 
for this purpose bt.t a spoon, or pencil, 
or any similar substance having a sur- 
face capable of being wetted by the 
liquid, answers equally well. 

3087. If, however, the vessel out of 
which it is wished to decant is large, 
very full, or the sides, on pouring, are 
nearly perpendicular, the plan is not 
successful ; thus, it could not be em- 
ployed in aidh.-g- the transfer of the 
liquid from one full tumbler to another. 
Even this may be accomplished with- 
out the aid of a funnel, or without 
spilling, by preventing the adhesion of 
the liquid to the edge or side of the 
vessel out of which it is poured, which 
may be readily done by greasing the 
rim, when it will be found quite 
practicable to pour out of a nearly 
full tumbler without spilling. 

3088. Iu many instances, the em- 
ployment of a syphon in decanting will 
be found very advantageous, particu- 
lary when the containing vessel is large, 
and cannot be readily moved, or whep 
there is any sediment which it is defin- 
able not to disturb. 

The most simple form of this instru- 
ment consists of a tube, bent as in 
Fig. 1, with one leg shorter than the 
other; this maybe made of glass, pew- 
ter, or, in fact, of any kind of stiff 
tubing that will retain its form a piece 
of gutta percha pipe, carefully bent by 
moderate warmth, whilst a piece of 
stout cord is in the interior to prevent

the sides closing together, answers very 
well. 

3090. Before use the syphon must 
be filled with liquor ; this is best ac- 
complished by turning it upside down, 
with the opening to the short leg 
raised on a level with that of the long 
one, when the liquid should be poured 
into the former. When both legs are 
rilled, they should be closed with the 
fingers ; the shorter leg introduced into 
the liquid it is wished to draw off; and 
the opening of the longer leg brought 
to a lower level than that of the shorter, 
and on removing the fingers the liquid 





3092. To do away with tue necessity 
of filling the syphon before Use, the in- 
strument is usually made with a sucking 
tube, as in F ig. 2 ; in this case, all that 
is requisite is, to introduce the short 
leg, close the opening to the long one, 
and by the action of the mouth, draw 
up the liquid until both legs are full, 
when on removing the finger, the 
stream will flow. 

3093. A very ingenious syphon of 
this kind is described by the German 
chemist Mohr ; it is thus constructed : 
Take a long Eau de Cologne bottle, 
and, with a file and turpentine, make a 
deep notch across, about an inch and 
a half from the bottom ; then with a 
charcoal point or pastile, or hot iron, 
produce a crack, and cut off the bottom, 
grinding it smoothly (all these manipu- 
lations are described in our article 
3078) then take a tube bent at an 
angle of forty-five degrees, and, by 
means of a good cork, perforated with 
a rat-tail rasp, fit it tightly in the bot- 
tom of the bottle, and add also another 
piece of tubing for a suction tube ; the 



Fig. 1. 

will flow as in Fig. 1, until it is below 
the level of the short leg. 
3091 . If the syphon is made of small 
tubing, or is lessen- 
ed at the openings 
so as not to exceed 
one quarter of an 
inch in diameter, 
there will be no oc- 
casion to close the . 
end of more than ! 
one leg with the 
finger, as the liquid 
will not flow when 
it is brought to the 
Fig. 2. proper position un- 

less both orifices are open ; and thus 
the necessity of plunging the finger into 
the liquid is obviated, and the syphon 
can also be used with a narrow-necked 
bottle, into which the hind could nt t 
b-a passed. 




whole will then have Lave the appear 
ance represented in Fig. 3, and will 
form an exceedingly useful, aod very 
convenient syphon.

rasp, and fit, air-tight, two tubes bent 
as in Fig. 4. On blowing through the 
upper, the liquid will be forced to as- 
cend and run over the bend of the 
other, which will then act as a syphon. 
This plan is exceedingly useful in 
emptying carboys of corrosive liquids, 
as oil of vitriol, &c. ; and if all the 
joints are as they should be air tight, 
the flow may be arrested by closing the 
upper tube with the finger. In the 
figure the outer leg of the syphon is 
shortened to save space ; in practice, 
it must be of sufficient length to be 
lower than the inner leg within the 
vessel. 

3095. If a syphon is required fre- 
quently for decanting the same kind of 
liquid, it is found troublesome to be 
constantly filling it before each time of 
using ; this trouble is obviated by the 
use of an instrument formed with legs 
of equal length, which are turned up 




Fig 5. 



at the ends, as in Fig 5 ; this having 
been filled, may be 
hung up in tle erect 
position, and the li- 
quid will not escape, 
but on plunging one 
end into a liquid, it 
will be found imme- 
diately to flow from 
the other, provided 
that the latter is 
below the level of the surface of the 
liquid. 

3096. The operations of straining 
and filtering are frequently required in 
domestic manipulations, and the appa- 
ratus employed usually consist of sieves 
and a jelly-bag. As, in many other in- 
stances, it will be found advantageous 
to import several contrivances from the 
laboratory to the kitchen, one of the 
most useful (because the most simple) 
strainers consists of a square frame, 
formed of four pieces of wood nailed 
together at the corners, with a piece of 
calico, linen, or canvas, of suitable fine- 
ness, tacked to the four sides ; this 
strainer is particularly useful in separ- 
ating any solid substance as the resi- 
due in making wines or if grated po- 
tatoes are put on one made of coarse 
cloth, the starch can be readily washed 
through, leaving the useless portion on 
the strainer ; the cloth should not be 
tacked very loosely, as it bags down 
when any substance is put on it, and the 
liquid runs away below from the cen- 
tre. This strainer is a most useful one ; 
it is readily made, of any Degree of 
fineness, and of any size ; and it also 
possesses the great advantage, that, if 
necessary, the tacks fastening the 
cloth can easily be withdrawn, when 
the substance remaining can be rolled 
up in the cloth, and tightly squeezed 
;o express the last portions of liquid, 
which are frequently the most valua- 
ble. 

3097. In cases where a finer filtra- 
;ion is required than can be obtained 
>y means of a cloth, as in cleaning tur- 
bid wine or spirit, the use of filtering 
>aper is recommended ; this paper 19

merely a stouter kind of blotting-paper, 
thick varieties of which answer very 
well for domestic purposes ; it is most 
simply used by taking a square piece, 
folding it into half by bringing the 
two opposite edges together and then 
folding the oblong so obtained across 
its length ; by this means a small 
square is obtained, one quarter the 
original size, which may be opened 
into a hollow cup, having three thick- 
ness of paper on one side, and one on 
the other; this is to be placed, with 
the point downwards, in a funnel, and 
the liquid poured in ; and as soon as 
the pores of the paper are expanded by 
the moisture, it will be found to flow 
through perfectly clear ; care must be 
taken in making the filter, not to finger 
it much where the two foldings cross 
each other, as a hole is readily made at 
that part, and the filter spoiled. The 
objection to this simple contrivance is, 
that from its flat sides applying them- 
selves closely to those of the funnel, 
the flow of the liquid is impeded, and 
is, therefore, slow. This effet may be 
obviated by the use of the plaited fil- 
ter, the construction of which we will 
endeavor to describe. 

3098. A square piece of filtering, or 
stout blotting-paper, is to be doubled, 
and the oblong so obtained is to be 
again folded in half, when if the last 
fold is opened, it will have the appear- 
ance of Fig. 6. From the corners b b, 
folds are to be creased in the direction 
towards a, but not reaching it for 
half an inch ; these are indicated by 
the dotted lines, which divide the 
doubled paper into four triangles, each 




Fig. 6. 

of which is to be again folded into 
eighths, and care must be taken that all 
the folds are made the same way that 



is, projecting to the same side of the 
paper. When complete, the doubled 
and creased paper will appear as in Fig. 
7. Now divide each eighth in halves, 
by a fold in the opposite direction to 




Fig. 7. 

those previously made, when it will be 
found that the whole will readily fold 
up like a paper fan ; the projecting 
loose ends which are formed by the 
corners b, should be cut off, and the 
double sides separated for the first 
time by blowing them apart, when the 
whole may be readily opened out as in 
Fig. 8. 

3099. In making this filter, which 
takes a much less 

time than to fol- 
low the descrip- 
tion, two precau- 
tions are requi- 
site. The folds 
should be made at 
once with one 
firm pressure, and 
not with a series 
of rubbings; and 
all the creases 
should stop bhort of the middle, other 
wise a hole will be made at that point 
long before the filter is completed. 
The advantages of this filter are, that 
it exposes a large surface for the liquid 
to pass through ; and from its only be- 
ing in contact with the funnel where 
the angles project, the current flows 
away readily. 

3100. The best means for filtration 
of water, and the construction of water 
filters, will be treated of when we 
speak of the "domestic manipulation'' 
connected with that liquid. 

3101. DIVIDING, POWDERING, 
GRINDING, &c The operations of 
chopping, powdering, grinding, &c., 
are so frequently required in cooking, 
and the other branches of domesti*

THAT CITY IS IN A BAD CASE WHOSE PHYSICIAN HATII THE GOUT. 



economy, as to render any description 
of their utility wholly unnecessary ; 
and \ve may therefore confine ourselves 
to describing the best means of accom- 
plishing the object desired. Powder- 
ing is usually performed by the aid of 
the pestle and mortar. Most of the 
works on Cookery recommend the use 
of a marble mortar; this material is 
about one of the worst that could be 
selected for the purpose, In the first 
place it is expensive ; secondly, it is 
rapidly corroded, even by the weak 
ncids used for food ; thirdly, it is read- 
ily stained by oily substances ; fourth- 
ly, it is absorptive of strong flavours, 
imparting them readily to the next 
substance pounded; and lastly, it is 
brittle, and even if not broken, is not 
calculated to withstand much wear. 
By far the best material for the pur- 
pose is the wedgewood ware ; mortars 
made of it are cheaper, cleaner in use, 
and stronger than those of marble, and 
are not corroded by acids or alkalies 
their pre-eminence is so great, that 
they are invariably used by druggists. 

3102. The act of powdering requires 
great tact and practice to perform it 
neatly and rapidly. After the object 
has been broken into small pieces by 
blows from the pestle, a grinding ac- 
tion is required ; this should at first be 
given by striking the fragments, not in 
the centre of the mortar, but towards 
the side furthest from the operator ; 
the pestle, by this means, grinds over 
them in its descent to the centre, and 
much more rapidly accomplishes their 
division than if mere blows are given. 
After the object has been divided to a 
certain extent, blows are entirely use- 
less, and a grinding in circles becomes 
requisite ; if the circle is confined to 
one part of the mortar, the same por- 
tions get rubbed over and over again, 
the others escaping ; this is avoided by 
constantly and regularly altering the 
size of the circles. 

3103. If they are commenced in the 
centre, they should gradually increase 
in size until the sides are reached, and 
then contract again, and so on. By 




this means the whole of the powder it 
brought under the 
action of the pestle, 
and the operation is 
much quicker than 
if performed at ran- 
dom. One great 
fault usually com- 
mitted in powder- 
ing, is the endeavor 
to operate on too 
large a quantity of 
material at one 
time. The opera- 
tion is much more 
rapidly conducted if Fig. 9. 

small portions are taken ; and if the 
material is tough, and contains much 
fibrous matter, the process may be 
very much shortened by removing 
those parts which are sufficiently pow- 
dered, by sifting from time to time 
through a sieve. This may be objec- 
tionable, however, from the fine pow- 
der escaping into the air; in this case, 
the following contrivances will be 
found useful: 

3104. A cylindrical tea-canister of 
the requisite size is taken, w : ith a 
loosely-fitting lid (or if tight, the lid 
may be enlarged by four slits being 
made partly up the sides) ; a bag of 
lawn is dropped into the canister, the 
top being turned over the edge ; the 
powder to be sifted is put in the bag, 
the lid put on, and by tapping and 
shaking, the finest portions pass into 
the canister without any escaping into 
the air a point of very considerable 
importance w r here the powder is irri- 
tating or expensive. 

3105. Various contrivances are con 
stantly had recourse to, in order to 
render certain substances more readily 
pulverable, the contrivance varying 
very much with the peculiarities of the 
substance. We will mention a few of 
these, as they may afford useful sug- 
gestions in cases of difficulty. All veg- 
etable, and many mineral substances 
are much more readily powdered after 
having been thoroughly dried ; so farm 
this process carried, that many 



AN OLD MAN IN A HOUSE IS A GOOD SIGN IN A HOUSE. 



379 



are dried so as to low fifteen per cent, 
of their weight before powdering. In 
proof of the utility of the drying, let 
any person try to powder a piece of 
whiting as it comes from the oilman's ; 
it will be found to cake together, and 
be not readily powdered ; if dry, how- 
ever, it powders with the greatest 
ease. 

3106. After drying, substances should 
not be exposed to the air, but, unless they 
are of such a nature as to be softened 
by heat, are better operated on whilst 
still warm. Flints are more readily 
powdered by being heated to redness, 
and quenched in cold water ; charcoal, 
for tooth-powder, whilst still warm 
from drying. Gum can only be pow- 
dered whilst perfectly dry. Camphor, 
which is with great difficulty powdered 
alone, yields readily if a drop or two of 
spirit is -poured on it. Substances 
which clog- together and cake under 
the pestle, are not uncommon ; to these 
it is sometimes requisite to add sand, 
which may afterwards be separated 
this prevents the clogging ; but its use 
is often impracticable. Lime, if re- 
quired in very fine powder, for dusting 
over plants to kill slugs, &c., is readily 
obtained by slaking it, when fresh 
burned, with boiling water; when, if 
too much water is not used, it falls into 
an exceedingly fine powder. 

3107. Sal ammoniac, and some other 
saline bodies, are most readily powder- 
ed by dissolving them in as small a 
quantity of boiling water as possible, 
and stirring the solution rapidly as the 
water is boiled away, or as the solution 
cools. Before dismissing the pestle 
and mortar, we may allude to its use 
in mixing powders together, although 
a much more ready mode of doing this 
is with a sieve. Two or more powders 
stirred together, and passed two or 
three times through a sieve, are much 
more intimately mixed, than if rubbed 
for a long time in a mortar. 

3108. Metals cannot be divided in 
a mortar ; the most convenient mode 
of proceeding, if they are fusible under 
ti white heat, is to melt them, and pour 



them whilst liquid into a pail of water, 
which should be lull, to avoid any splut- 
tering, and the hotter the metal, tho 
more filmy the particles. It is scarce- 
ly requisite to state, that the metal 
should be poured in a circle, so as not 
to collect at one place. 

3109. Chopping is usually perform- 
ed in the kitchen, with a large com- 
mon knife ; but is more speedily dono 
by some of the improved contrivances 
similar to the following: The chop- 
ping-board should be made of hard 
wood, with the grain at right angles to 
the surface of the board, by which it 
is rendered much more durable than if 
they are parallel to it. The ehopping- 
knives should be fixed at right angles 
to the handles, and may be either oi 
the following patterns. If a large 
quantity of material has to be acted on, 




Fi^lO. Fig. U. 

we would recommend a board as 
above, not less than three iuches thick, 
and smooth on both sides, so that 
either may be used, of the requisite 
size say eighteen inches or two feet 
in diameter. On this should stand a 
loose bottomless tub, to confine the 
materials, and the whole resting on 
the floor, should be used w:th a knife, 
sufficiently long In the handle to be 
employed by a person standing erect, 
and it should have a small cross-bar 
for the hands, as shown in Fig. 12. 

3110. Small chopping-knives are sold 
consisting of three blades nvetted to 
gether, and a very convenient one is 
made by fastening, at convenient dis- 
tances, a number of flat circular disk a

sharpened at the edges, on to a central 
axis with a handle at each end. 

3 HI. Many substances, such as stale 
bread, dried herbs, &c., may be very 
conveniently powdered by rubbing them 




Fig. 12. 

through a wire sieve, of the requisite 
degree of fijeness. Herbs intended for 
use in this way, should be dried as 
rapidly as possible, without being 
scorched, in small heaps, before the 
fire ; parsley and others done this way, 
may be powdered, retaining their bright 
green colour and flavour, both of which 
are preserved if they are corked tightly 
in bottles, and kept in a dry, dark cup- 
board. The use of waxed paper to 
preserve dried powders in, or for tying 
them down in jars, or generally as a 
very good substitute for bladder, will 
often be found convenient. It is readily 
made by laying a sheet of smooth stout 
paper on a warm iron plate, as the top 
of a kitchen oven ; on this place the 
thin tissue or other paper to be waxed ; 
put a piece of wax on it, and as it melts, 
rub it over, spreading it evenly. One 
end of a cork, covered with two thick- 
nesses of linen, answers very well for a 
rubber. If a hot plate is riot at hand, 
ihe sheet of paper may be held before 
Bie fire, and rubbed over, as it warms, 
irith the cut edge of a cake of white 
wax ; but this requires the co-operation 
nf two persons. 
:>! 1 v. KNOTS. P SCKAGES, PARCELS, 



ETC. The poet Crabbo, speaking- of 
the writing of the rustics, signing his 
parish registers, says 

" 'Tis strange that men 

Who guide the plough should fail 
to guide the pen ! 

For half a mile the furrows even lie; 

For half an inch the letters stand 
awry." 

A parallel remark might with equal 
justice be made on the gentler sex, who, 
after exercising a degree of tact, oeat- 
ness, and tasteful invention, that the 
self-styled " lords of the creation' ' might 
in vain hope to rival, in the formation 
of a piece of needlework, knitting, net- 
ting, or crotchet, are, for the most part, 
totally unable, when it is finished, to 
tie it up so as to make a decent parcel : 
ladies' packages are, in fact, the oppro- 
brium of the sex the annoyance of all 
carriers, cads, and coachmen who have 
anything to do with their conveyance, 
and the torment of their owners : the 
cords are certain to become loose, the 
knots are sure to slip, except when a 
slip-knot is requisite, and then it is a 
fixture ! It is in the hope that we may 
be instrumental in improving this state 
of things, that we are induced to devote 
this article to Knots, Packages, Parcels, 
&c., and w r e shall at once lay before our 
fair readers a method of tying a parcel 
neatly and securely, and at the same 
time affording facilities of releasing the 
contents without destroying the string 
by cutting it away a too-ordinary 
practice, especially where time is an 
object. 

3113. The most simple purpose foi 
which a knot is required, is the fasten 
ing together of two pieces of string or 




Fig. 13. 

cord : the knot selected for this pur- 
pose should possess two important pro- 
perties; it should be secure from el'tp-

ping, and of small size. Nothing is 
more common than to see two coids 
attached together in a manner simila 
to that shown in fig. 13. It is scarce!) 
possible to imagine a worse knot; it ii 
large and clumsy, and as the cords dc 
not mutually press each other, it is cer 
tain to slip if pulled with any force 
3114. In striking con 
trust to this the worsi 
of all, we place one o: 
the best ; namely, the 
knot usually employee 
by netters, and which is 
called by sailors " the 
sheet-bend." It is read 
ily made by bending one 
of the pieces of cord into 
a loop (a b, Fig. 14) 
which is to be held be 
/ tweeu the finger and 
thumb of the left hand ; 
the other cord c is passed 
through the loop from 
the farther side, then 
round behind the two 
legs of the loop, and last- 
ly, under itself, the loose 
end coming out at d. In 
Fig. 14. the smallness of its size, 
and the firmness with which the various 
parts grip together, this knot surpasses 
every other: it can, moreover, be tied 
readily when one of the pieces, viz., a 
b, is exceedingly short; in common 
stout twine, less than an inch being 
sufficient to form the loop. The above 
method of forming it is the simplest to 
describe, although not the most rapid 
in practice ; as it may be made in much 
ess time by crossing the two ends of 
eord ( a b, Fig. 15) on the tip of the 
forefinger of the left hand, and holding- 
them firmly by the left thumb, which 
covers the crossing; then the part c is 
to be wound round the thumb in a loop, 
as shown in the figure, and passed be- 
tween the two ends, behind a and be- 
fore />; the knot is completed by turn- 
ing the end b downwards in front of d, 
passing it through the loop, securing it 
under the left thumb, and tightening the 
whole by pulling i. Ax formed in this 




mode, it is more rapidly made than al- 
most any other knot; and, as before 
stated, it excels all in security and 
compactness, so firmly do the various 
turns grip each other, that after having 
been tightly pulled, it is very difficult 




Fig. 15. 

to untie ; this is the only drawback to 
its usefulness, and in this respect it is 
inferior to the reef-knot, Fig. 16, which 
is made in precisely the same manner 
that a shoe-string is tied, only pulling 
5ut the ends instead of leaving them as 
bows. 

31 15. The only precau- 
tion necessary in making 
a reef-knot is, to observe 
that the two parts of each 
string are on the same 
side of the loop ; if they 
ire not, the ends (and the 
3ows, if any are formed) 
are at right angles to the 
cords: the knot is less 
secure, and is termed by 
sailors a granny-knot. 
Other knots are occa- 
sionally used to connect 
wo cords, but it is un- 
necessary to describe 

hem, as eveiy useful 
urpose may be answered 
y those abovernentioned.

some difficulty is often experienced in 
fastening: it at the finish ; if, however, 
the string is placed over the part to be 
united, as shown in Fig. 17, and the 
long end b, used to bind around the rod, 
and finally passed through the loop a, 
as shown in Fig. 18, it is readily se- 
cured by pulling d, when the loop is 
drawn in, and fastens the end of the 
eord. 




Fig. 18. Fig. 17. 

3117. For fastening a cord to any 
cylindrical object, one of the most use- 
ful knots is the clove hitch, which, al- 
though exceedingly simple and most 
easily made, is one of the most puzzling 
knots to' the uninitiated. There are 
several modes of forming it, the most 
simple being perhaps as follows : make 
two loops, precisely similar in every 
respect, as a and b, Fig. 19, then bring 
fe in front of a, so as to make both loops 
correspond, and pass them over the ob- 
ject to be tied, tightening the ends ; if 
this is properly done, the knot will not 
dip, although surrounding a tolerably 
smooth cylindrical object, as a pillar, 
pole, &c. This knot is employed by 



surgeons in reducing dislocations of tin 
last joint of the thumb, and by nailora 
in great part of the standing rigging 
The loop which is formed when a cable 
is passed around a post or tree to secure 




Fig. 19. 

a vessel near shore, is fastened by what 
sailors term two half hitches, which is 
simply a clove hitch made by the end 
of the rope which is passed around the 
post or tree, and then made to describe 
the clove hitch around that part of it- 
self which is tightly strained. 

3118. From the tying of knots we 
may pass on to the tying over of bot- 
tles, preserves, jars, &c. ; the object 
with which this operation is performed 
is either to prevent the access of air or 
the escape or entrance of moisture ; the 
act itself is so very simple as to require 
no explanation ; but & few words may 
be said on the choice of material, 
which should be varied, so as to suit 
the exigencies of each particular case. 
When a vessel of spirit is to be tied 
over, leather is frequently selected a 
very erroneous practice, as the vapour 
of spirit passes readily through that 
substance, but cannot penetrate blad- 
der, which should be invariably used 
for the purpose. So effectually is spirit 
confined by bladder, that when weak 
spirits are put into bladders or into ves- 
sels tied over with bladder, and allowed 
to remain sometime, they are strength- 
ened, as the vapour of the water passes 
away, that of the spirit being retained. 

31 19. Bladder, or other animal mem- 
branes of the same nature, in a moist 
and flaccid state, are usually selected 
for tying over preserves and jams, for 
which they are well adapted ; should it 
be impracticable to obtain them, the 
waxed paper described in 3111 is a 
very good substitute. Many person! 1 
place a thin piece of oiled paper in the 
jar resting on the jam, iu addition if 






HE SENDS THEM A BLIND GUIDE

tying it down ; this assists in excluding 
air and preventing mouldiness, but we 
have found a piece of very thin paper 
moistened with white of egg much 
more efficacious. The thin sheet-lead 
used for lining the interior of tea-chests, 
or stout tin-foil, is very advantageously 
used in tying down vessels containing 
specimens of natural history preserved 
in spirits, as they effectually prevent 
the escape of the latter for a long series 
of years. The plan usually pursued is 
to tie the cork over first with a single 
bladder, then with the metal, and final- 
ly with a second piece of bladder, which 
is afterwards covered with black paint. 

3120. The tying up of parcels in pa- 
per is an operation which is seldom 
neatly performed by persons whose oc- 
cupations have not given them great 
facilities for constant practice. Wheth- 
et the paper be wrapped around the 
objects, as is the case usually when it 
is much larger than sufficient to enclose 
them, or merely folded over itself, as is 
done by druggists, who cut the paper to 
the required size, it is important that 
the breadth of the paper should be 
no longer than sufficient to enable it to 
be folded over the ends of the object 
enclosed, without passing over the op- 
posite side : it is impossible to make a 
neat or close parcel with paper which 
is too broad ; excess in length may be 
readily disposed of by wrapping it 
round ; but excess of breadth should be 
cut away. With regard to turning in 
the ends the mode adopted by grocers 
is the best. The most common cause 
of failure in parcels is their being badly 
corded ; we will, therefore (however 
unnecessary the description of so simple 
a performance may appear to those al- 
ready acquainted with it), describe the 
most readily-acquired mode of cording. 

3121. Let a single knot be made in 
the end of the cord, which is then pass- 
ed round the box or parcel. This knot- 
ted end is now tied by a single hitch 
round the middle of the cord (Fig 20) 
and the whole pulled tight. The cord 
itself is then carried at right angles 
round the end of the parcel, and where 



it crosses the transverse cord on the 
bottom of the tKx (Fig. 21), it should, 
if the parcel is heavy and requires to 
be firmly secured, be passed over the 
cross cord, then back underneath it, and 
pulled tightly, then, over itself; lastly, 
under the cross cord, and on around the 
other end of the box. When it reaches 




Fig. 20. 

the top it must be secured by passing it 
under that part of the cord which runs 
lengthways (a, Fig. 20) pulling it very 
tight, and fastening it by two half 
hitches round itself. The great cause 




Fig. 21. 

of parcels becoming loose is the fact of 
the cord being often fastened to one of 
the transverse parts (as b, Fig. 20) in- 
stead of the piece running lengthways, 
and in this case it invariably becomes 
loose. The description may perhaps 
be rendered clearer by the aid of the 
figures, which exhibit the top and bot- 
tom of a box corded as described. The 
cords, however, are shown in a loose 
state to allow their arrangement to be 
perceived more easily. 

3122. LAYING OUT FIRST- 
CLASS TABLES. BREAKFAST, 
LUNCHEONS, AND FOLDING NAPKINS. 

3123. The art of laying out a table 
consists in arrranging the various dishes, 
plate, glass, &c., methodically, and ad 



384 



GEORGE WASHINGTON'S TERM OF OFFICE, 1789 TO 1797. 



hering to the rules we are about to 
make known. 

3124. Much trouble, irregularity, and 
confusion will be avoided in a house 
when there is company, if servants are 
instructed to prepare the table, side 
board, or dinner-wagon, in a similar 
manner and order daily. 

3125. All tables are usually laid out 
according to the following rules through- 
out the United States ; yet there are 
local peculiarities which will necessa- 
rily present themselves, and should be 
adopted or rejected, as may appeal- 
proper to the good housewife : 

31 26. BREAKFAST s. The table 
should be covered with a clean white 
cloth ; the cups and saucers arranged at 
one end, if for tea ; and at both ends, if 
for tea and coffee ; or the coffee-cups 
and saucers may be arranged at the 
right hand side of one end of the table, 
and the tea-cups and saucers at the 
left ; the tea-pot and coffee-pot occupy- 
ing the space between in front, and the 
urn that at the back. Some persons 
substitute cocoa or chocolate for coffee, 
in which case they a re to be placed the 
same. The slop-basin and milk-jug 
should be placed to the left ; and the 
cream, and hot milk-jugs, with the su- 
gar basin, to the right. 

3127. The remainder of the table 
should be occupied in the centre by the 
various dishes to be partaken of; while 
at the sides must be ranged a large 
plate for meat, eggs, &c., and a small 
one for toast, rolls, &c., with a small 
knife and fork for each person ; the 
carving knife and fork being placed 
point to handle ; the butter and bread 
knives to the right of their respective 
dishes, which occupy the centre part, 
and spoons in front of the hot dishes 
with gravy. Salt cellers should occupy 
the four corners, and, if required, the 
cruets should be placed in the centre of 
the table. (Set 31 58.) 

3J28. Dry toast should never be pre- 
pared longer than five minutes before 
serving, as it becomes tough, and the 
buttered, soppy and greasy, if too 
long prepared Hot rolls should be 



brought to table covered with a nap- 
kin. 

3129. Every dish should be garnish- 
ed appropriately, either with sippets 
ornamental butter, water-cresses, pars- 
ley, or some one of the garnishes \va 
shall point out in another page. (Set 
2542.) 

3130. The dishes usually set upon 
the tables are selected from hot, cold, 
and cured meats; hot, cold, cured, and 
potted fish ; game ; poultry, cold or 
devilled ; fruit, ripe, preserved, or can- 
died ; dressed and undressed vegeta- 
bles ; meat-pies and patties, cold ; eggs ; 
honey-comb; entrees; and savoury 
morsels as grilled kidneys, ham-toast, 
devils, &c. 

3131. When laid for a marriage 
breakfast, a bride's cake should occupy 
the centre instead of the epergne or 
plateau. (See 2923, and 2930.)' 

3132. LUNCHEONS, OK NOONINGS 
The luncheon is laid in two ways: 
one way is to bring in a tray with let 
down sides, on which it is previously 
arranged upon a tray cloth, and letting 
down the sides and spreading the cloth 
upon the dining-table to distribute the 
things as required. The other is to lay 
the cloth as for dinner, with the pickle- 
stand and cruets opposite each other ; 
and, if in season, a small vaee of flowers 
in the centre ; if not, a water-jug and 
tumblers, which may be placed on a 
side-table at other times. The sides of 
the table are occupied by the requisites 
for each guest, viz., two plates, a large 
and small fork and knives, and dessert- 
spoon. A folded napkin, and the bread 
under, is placed upon the plate of each 
guest. 

3133. Carafes, with the tumblers be- 
longing to and placed over them, are 
'aid at the four corners, with the salt 
ellers in front of them, between two 

table-spoons laid bowl to handle. 

3134. The dishes generally served for 
uncheons are tiie remains o*f cold meat 

neatly trimmed and garnished; cold 

game, hashed or p'ain ; hashes of all 

descriptions ; curries ; minced meats 

old pies, saxourj , fr lit, or plain 



JOHN ADAMS' TEHM }F OFFiCE,1797 TO 1801. 



385 



plainly-cooked cutlets, steaks, and 
chops ; omelettes ; bacon ; eggs ; dev- 
ils' and grilled bones ; potatoes ; sweet- 
meats ; butter ; cheese ; salad and 
pickles. In fact, almost anything does 
for lunch, whether of fish, flesh, fowl, 
pastry, vegetables, or fruit. 

3135. Ale and porter are generally 
served, but occasionally sherry, port, or 
home-made wines are introduced, with 
biscuits and ripe fruit. 

3136. A good housewife should al- 
ways have something in the house 
ready to convert into a neat little lun- 
cheon, in case a few friends drop in, to 
what some are pleased to call a " tif- 
fin;" and it is astonishing how a really 
handsome-looking affair may be made 
out of the remains of the dinner served 
the day before, some handsome glass, 
a sprinkle of good plate, a few flowers, 
some good ale, or a little wine, and 
above all, a hearty welcome. 

3137. NAPKINS. Dinner napkins 
should be about twenty-eight inches 
broad, and thirty inches long-. They 
may* be folded in a variety of ways, 
which imparts a style to a table, with- 
out adding much to the expense, and 
may be readily accomplished with a 
little practice and attention to the fol- 
lowing directions and diagrams. (-See 
2588.) 

3138. THE MITRE (Fig. 1). Fold 
the napkin into three parts longways, 
then turn down tho right hand .corner, 
and turn up the left-hand one, as in Fig. 
2, a and b. Turn back the point a 
towards the right, so that it shall lie 
behind c ; and b to the left, so as to 
be behind d. Double the napkin back 
at the line e, then turn up / from be- 
fore antl ^-frorn behind, when they will 
appear as in Fig. 3. Bend the corner 
h towards the right, and tuck it behind 
t, and turn back the corner k towards 
the left, at the dotted line, and tuck it 
into a corresponding part at the back. 
The bread is placed under the mitre, or 
in the centre at the top. 

3139. THE EXQUISITE (Fig. 4). 
Fold the napkia into three parts long- 
ways, then fold down two-fifths of the 



length from each side, as in Fig. 5, at 
; roll up the part b towards the 
back, repeat on the other side, then 
turn up the corner towards the corner 

a, and it will appear as d. The cen- 
tre part e is now to be turned up at 
the bottom, and down at the top, and 
the two rolls brought under the centre 
piece, as in Fig. 4. The bread is placed 
under the centre baud, fc, Fig. 4. 

3140. THE COLLEGIAN (Fig. G). 
Fold the napkin into three parts long 
ways, then turn down the two sides 
towards you, so that they shall appear 
as in Fig. 7 ; then roll up the part a 
underneath until it looks like b, Fig. 

8. Now take the corner b and turn it 
up towards c, so that the edge of the 
rolled part shall be even with the cen- 
tral line ; repeat the same on the other 
side, and turn the whole over, when it 
will appear as in Fig. 6. The bread iw 
placed underneath the part k. 

3141. THE CINDERELLA (Fig. 9). 
Fold the napkin into three parts long- 
ways, then turn down the two sides as 
in Fig. 7 ; turn the napkin over, and 
roll up the lower part as in Fig. 10, a 

b. Now turn the corner b upwards 
towards c, so that it shall appear as in 
d ; repeat on the other side, and then 
bring the two parts e together so that 
they shall bend at the dotted line ; and 
the appearance will now be as in Fig. 

9. The bread is pluced under the 
apron part k, Fig. 9. 

3142. THE F L i R T. (Fig. 11.) 
Fold the napkin into three parts 
longways, then fold across the breadth, 
commencing at one extremity, and con- 
tinuing- to fold from and to yourself in 
folds about two inches broad, until tho 
whole is done ; then place in a tumbler, 
and it will appear as in the illustra 
tion. 

3143. THE YOUNG AMERICA.- 
(Fig. 12.) Fold the napkin into three 
parts longways, then fold one of the up- 
per parts upon itself from you; turn 
over the cloth with the part having four 
folds from you, and fold down the two 
sides so as to appear as in Fig. 7 ; then 
roll up the part a underneath, until it 



386 



THOMAS JEFFERSON'S TERM OF OFFICE, 1801 TO 1809. 




JAMES MADISON'S TEIUI OF OFFICE, 1809 TO 1817. 



387 



appears as in the dotted lines in Fig. 
15, at b. Now turn up the corner b 
towards c, so that the edge of the 
rolled part shall be even with th.e cen- 
tral line: repeat the same upon the 
opposite side, and turn the whole over, 
when it will appear as in Fig. 14; the 
bread being placed underneath the part 
k, as represented in the illustra- 
tion. 

3144. 7. THE "FAVOURITE," OR 
OUR OWN. (Fig. 14.) Fold the nap- 
kin into three parts longways, then turn 
down the two sides as in Fig. 7, and 
roll up the part b on both sides, until 
as represented on the right hand side in 
Fig. 14 ; then turn it backwards (as a 
b) on both sides : now 7 fold down the 
point c towards you, turn over the 
napkin, and fold the two other parts 
from you so that they shall appear as 
in Fig. 15. Turn the napkin over, thus 
folded, and raising the centre part with 
the two thumbs, draw the two ends (a 
and b) together, and pull out the parts 
(c and d) until they appear as in Fig. 
13. The bread is to be placed as re- 
presented in k, Fig. 13. 

3145. DINNERS. The appearance a 
dinner-table presents does not depend 
eo much upon a profuseness of viands, 
as upon the neatness, cleanliness, and 
well studied arrangement of the whole. 
Taste, if well directed, may produce a 
handsome dinner ; whereas three times 
the amount of money may be expended 
upon another, and yet not make oven a 
respectable appearance. 

3146. We cannot too strongly urge 
the necessity of having things done in 
the same manner every day as when 
there is company. The servants be- 
come accustomed to waiting properly, 
things are always at hand, and they do 
not appear awkward when visitors drop 
ii ; then everything is regular, and 
goes on smoothly. 

3147. To LAY THE CLOTH. The 
t.ible should be well polished, and then 
covered with a green baize cloth, over 
which a fine white damask one should 
be spread. If the white cloth i to be 

17 



kept on after dinner, it is customary to 
spread a small cloth at either end of the 
table where the large dishes are placed, 
to protect the long cloth from accidental 
spots arising from the gravy, &c. ; these 
slips are removed after dinner, and the 
cloth cleaned with crumb-brushes. In 
some houses an entire upper cloth is 
placed upon the table instead ef slips, 
and this being removed after dinner, 
does not require the tedious process of 
brushing- the table-cloth. 

3148. Whec the cloth has been spread, 
place carafes, with the tumblers be- 
longing to and placed over them, be- 
tween every four persons, a salt-celler 
between every third person, and a large 
and small knife, fork, and spoon, to 
each guest, with two wine-glasses, a 
champagne glass, and a tumbler, to the 
right of each, and the bread placed in 
or under folded napkins between the 
knives, forks, and spoons ; and at grand 
entertainments or public dinners, the 
name and rank of each guest neatly 
written on a card in front of napkin, so 
as to prevent confusion and jealousy. 
The centre ornament, usually a cande- 
labrum, plateau, an cpcrgne, or a vase 
of artificial flowers, must now be set on, 
and the mats for the various dishes ar- 
ranged; then the wine-coolers or orna- 
mental vases placed between the cen- 
tre piece and the top and bottom 
disheg, with the wines in the original 
bottles, loosely corked : the spoons for 
assisting the various dishes, asparagus 
tongs, fish knife and fork or slice, and 
carving knives and forks, are placed in 
front of the respective dishes to vahich 
they belong; and knife-rests opposite 
to those who have to carve ; with a 
bill of fare, and a pile of soup-plates 
before those that have to assist the 
soup. 

3149. In arranging or laying out a 
table, several things require particular 
attention, and especially the follow- 
ing : 

Plate should be well cleaned, and 
have a bright polish ; few things look 
worse than to see a greasy-looking

epergne and streaky spoons. (See 514.) 
Glass should be well rubbed with a 
washleather, dipped in a solution of 
fine whiting and stoneblue, and then 
dried : afterwards it should be polished 
with an old silk handkerchief. Plates 
and dishes should be hot, otherwise the 
guests will be disgusted by seeing flakes 
of fat floating about in the gravy. 
Bread should be ut in pieces about an 
inch thick, and each round of a loaf 
into six parts, or if for a dinner party, 
dinner rolls should be ordered. The 
bread is placed under the napkins, or 
on the left of each guest ; if dinner 
napkins are not used, some of the bread 
being placed in a bread-tray covered 
with a crotchet cloth upon the side- 
board. Lights, either at or after the 
dinner, should be subdued, and above 
the guests, if possible, so as to be shed 
upon the table, without intercepting 
the view. Sauces, either bottle, sweet, 
or boat vegetables, and sliced cucum- 
ber, or glazed onions for fall goose, 
should be placed upon the sideboard ; a 
plate basket for removing the soiled 
plates is usually placed under the side- 
board, or some other convenient part of 
the room ; and two knife-trays, covered 
with napkins, are placed upon a butler's 
tray ; these are used for removing 
soiled carvers and forks, and the soiled 
silver. It is useful to have a large sized 
bradawl, a corkscrew, and funnel, with 
etraiuer ; the former to break the wire 
of the champagne bottles, and the lat- 
ter to strain port wine, if required to 
be opened during dinner. 

3150. To lay out the sideboard or 
tray. Little requires to be done, ex- 
cept to ' arrange the silver, knives, 
cruets, and various dishes to be placed 
there. The silver should be arranged 
on one end of the sideboard, a& in Figs. 
1 and 2, the gravy spoons being placed 
bowl to handle, and the cheese-scoop, 
marrow-spoon, and salad-spoons or scis- 
sors, where most convenient. The 
knives are placed as in Fig. 3, for tne 
convenience of removal, because by this 
means a single knife can be abstracted 
without disturbing the others ; carving 



knives and forks should be placed 
above the others, point to handle. 




Figs. I & 2. 

3151. The wine-glasses, tumblers, 
and finger-glasses, for dessert, are 
placed where most convenient, but 
usually in the centre, at the back, with 
ice-plates near to them, and the wine-

glasses placed in the finger glasses, at 
in Fig. 4 ; but when only one glass is 
used, that is placed in the centre, 
mouth downwards. At very large or 
fashionable dinners, the finger-glasses 
are sometimes placed oi the dinner ta- 
ble with the plain and coloured wine- 
glasses in them, and the same refilled, 
are placed again at dessert. The 
cruets, sauces, &c. are placed at one 
end, and the vegetables Ac. in the cen- 
tre front of the sideboard.

large dinners, with a bill of fare, and 
instructed at small ones, where fhe 
dishes are to be placed. No two dishes 
resembling each other should be near 
the same part of the table. Soups or 
broth should always be placed at the 
head of the table ; if t'here are two, 
top arid bottom ; if four, top, bottom, 
and frvvo sides, opposite each other, or 
alternately with fish. Fish should be 
placed at the head of the table; if 
there are two sorts, have fried at the 
bottom, and boiled at the top ; if four, 
arrange the same as the Boup. We 
may observe, that a white and 
brown, or a mild and high-seasoned 
soup, should occupy either side of the 
centre piece, and that it looks hand- 
somer to have fried and boiled fish op- 
posite each other, but they should never 
be placed upon the same dish. Fish is 
generally served upon a napkin, the 
corners of which are either turned in 
or thrown over the fish, or upon a 
piece of simple netting, which is turn- 
ed in all round ; but we recommend 
our readers to use the elegant serviette, 
as being more stylish. 

3153. The first course generally con- 
sists of soups and fish, which are 
removed by the roasts, stews, &c., of 
the second course. 

3154. The second course, when there 
are three, consists of roasts and stews for 
the top and bottom ; turkey or fowls, 
ham garnished, tongue, or fricandeau, 
for the side ; with small made-dishes 
for corners, served in covered-dishes, 
as curries, ragouts, fricassees, stews, 
palates, &c. 

3155. When there are two roasts, 
one should be white, and the other 
brown. Removes are generally placed 
upon large dishes, for, as they supply 
the place of the fish and soups, they 
constitute the principal part of the 
iiriner. What are termed flancs are 
not so large as the removes, nor so 
small as the entrees, or. made-dishes, 
and are generally served in a different- 
ly formed dish. They are seldom used 
except when there are eighteen or 
twenty persons. 



3156. Entries, or made dishes, re 
quire great care in placing them upon 
the table, otherwise the gravy slops 
over and soils the dish ; they are, there- 
fore, usually served with a wall of 
mashed potatoes, rice or other vegeta- 
bles, to keep them in their proper 
place. They should also be served aa 
hot as possible. 

3157. -When there is but one princi- 
pal dish, it should be placed at the 
head of the table. If three dishes, 
the principal to the head, and the others 
opposite each other, near the bottom; 
if four, the largest to the head, the 
next size to the foot, and the other 
two at the sides ; if five, place the 
same as for four, with the smallest in the 
centre ; if six, place the same as for 
four, with two small dishes on each 
side ; if seven, put three dishes down 
the centre of the table, and two on 
each side; if eight, four dishes down 
the middle, and two on each side, at 
equal distances ; if nine, place them in 
three equal lines, but with the proper 
dishes at the top and bottom f the 
table ; if ten, put four down the centre, 
one at each corner, and one on each 
side, opposite the vacancy between the 
two central dishes ; or four down the 
middle, and three on each side oppo- 
site the vacancies of the centre dishes ; 
if twelve, place them in three rows of 
four each, or six down the middle, and 
three at equal distances on each side. 
If more than twelve, they must be ar- 
ranged on the same principles, but 
varying according to number. 

3158. Oval or circular dining- tables 
require to have the dishes arranged in 
a shape corresponding to the table. 

3159. The third course consists of 
game, confectionery, delicate vegetables 
dressed in the French style, puddings, 
creams, jellies, &c. 

3160. }^ien there are only two courses, 
the first generally consists of soups and 
fish, removed by boiled poultry, ham, 
tongue, stews, roasts, ragouts, curries, 
or made-dishes generally, with vegeta- 
bles. The second consists of roasted 
poultry or game at the top and bottom

with dressed vegetables, maccaroni, I where the dishes are to be placed, and,

and general confectionery, salads, & c. 
It is generally contrived to give as great

3161. After the third course has been 
removed, cheese, ornamented butter, 
salad, radishes, celery in a glass bowl 
or on a dish, sliced cucumber (and at 



small parties, 
usually served. 



marrow-bones), are 



3162. A mar row- spoon, cheese-scoop, 
and butter-knife, Tbeing required upon 
the table, are to be placed near to 
the dishes ; a knife and fork near the 
celery, and a pair of salad-scissors or a 
fork and spoon in the bowl with the salad. 

3163. The cheese may be served in 
a glass bowl, and handed round from 
right to left ; or if Stilton, surrounded 
with the elegant serviette, and placed 
upon the cheese-cloth. The bread may 
be seryed as usual, or the cheese-snaps, 
piled up on a crochet-cloth, in a plated 
bread-basket placed in the centre. 

3164. Waiting at Table. Much con- 
fusion is avoided by having an attend- 
ant upon each side of the table ; or, if 
the party is large, more than one, ac- 
cording to the number. The usual 
number require^! for parties is given 
below: and if the income admit of it, 
the scale may be increased, according 
to the second column, which will mater- 
ially add to the comfort of the guests.

appointed for that purpose 
nd by the side of each dish, 



3165. Every attendant should be 
oently attired, have a white neckcloth 
and white gloves on, should know 
where all the articles required are, 



singly from the 
assisting it, and carrie 



routine of the party, and therefore it 
is better to provide each one with a 
bill of fare. 

3166. When every guest is seated, 
a servant 

should sta 

with the right hand upon the cover; 
and as soon as grace is said, the cover 
is to be removed, and placed in some 
convenient part of the room. The 
plates for soup should thsn be taken 
i-te the person 
to those guests 

that desire that particular soup, ob- 
serving that ladies are to be assisted 
before gentlemen, and that these should 
commence from the head of the table 
continuing to assist each until both 
sides are helped. 

3167. Soon after the eoup has been 
served, the servants may pass down 
each side of the table, and ask each 
guest what they will take, assisting 
them to the dkh desired as soon as it 
can be procured. When champagne 
is given, it is handed round upon a 
waiter or salver at small parties, com- 
mencing at the right hand side of the 
table from the top and bottom simul- 
taneously, without any distinction as 
regards ladies or gentlemen. In brge 
parties and we prefer the arrangement 
ourselves even in small ones the 
bottle being enveloped as far as the 
neck with a clean dinner-napkin, the 
wine is assisted in the same order as 
before; but instead of being handed 
round on a salver, the servants pour the 
wine into the glass, at the right-hand 
side of each guest. By these means 
there is less danger of the glasses being 
broken by any awkward collision. 
The champagne is generally iced in 
summer, and cool in winter, and is as- 
sisted as sooii as the soup is finished, 
or just after the guests have been 
helped to the- second course of re- 
moves. 

3168. Liqueurs are handed round when 
sweets are on the table. Sauces are 
handed round in the sauce-boat, and 



MARTIX VAX BUREN'S TERM or OFFICE 1837 TO 1841. 



391 



When served, placed on the side-board 
or dinner-waggon ; if only a family 
party, they are returned to the table. 
Sweet sauces are handed round in 
glass dishes, and bottle-sauces in a 
stand or basket made for that pur- 
pose, 

3169. In removing the dinner things, 
one servant goes round the table with 
a tray, and the other removes and 
places the things upon it. The cloth is 
then brushed with a dumb-brush ; or 
the two sides are turned in, and then 
the cloth dexterously jerked off the 
table, the lights replaced, and the des- 
sert set on. 

3170. When knives, forks, and 
spoons, are removed from dishes or 
plates, they should be placed in proper 
trays covered with napkins ; one being 
used for the silver, the other for the 
steel articles. 

3171. When plates or dishes are 
removed from the table, great care is 
to be observed with respect to holding 
them horizontally, otherwise the gravy, 
syrup or liquid, may injure the dresses 
of the guests. 

8172. In some circles, the fashion 
prevails of placing finger-glasses on 
table immediately preceding dessert ; 
but in others, especially of the highest 
fashion, cut-glass bowls, partially filled 
with rose or orange-flower water, iced 
in summer and lukewarm in winter, 
are handed down each side of the 
table, upon salvers: into these each 
guest dips the corner of the dinner 
napkin, and just touches the lips and 
the tips of the fingers, to afford a re- 
freshing feeling. 

3173. THE DESSERT. The dessert 
raay consist of merely two dishes of 
fruit for the top and bottom; dried 
fruits, biscuits, filberts, &c., for the 
sides and corners ; and a cake for the 
centre. 

3174. When the party is large, and 
ices are served, the ice-plates are placed 
round the table, and ice-pails at both 
ends of the table, and dishes with 
wafer-biscuits nt the sides. Some 
persons have the ices served in glas* 



dishes, which, together with the wafer- 
biscuits, are handed round before the 
usual dessert. 

3175. When there is preserved gin- 
ger, it follows the ices, as it serves to 
stimulate the palate, so that the deli- 
cious coolness of the wines may be 
better appreciated. 

3176. The side and corner dishes 
usually put on for dessert, consist of: 
Compotes in glass dishes; frosted 
fruit served on lace-paper, in small 
glass dishes; preserved and dried fruits, 
in glass dishes ; biscuits, plain and 
fancy ; fresh fruit, served in dishes 
surrounded with leaves or moss ; olives, 
wafer-biscuits, brandy-scrolls, &c. 

3177. The centre dishes may con- 
sist either of a Savoy or an ornamental 
cake, on an elevated stand a group 
of waxen fruit, surrounded with moss 
a melon a pine apple grapes or 
a vase of flowers. 

3178. BEHAVIOR AT DINNER. 
There is no situation in which one's 
breeding is more observed, than at the 
dinner-table ; our work would therefore 
be incomplete without the proper di- 
rections as to its etiquette. 

3179. If there are ladies, gentlemen 
offer their arms, and conduct them to 
the dining-room, according to their age, 
or the degree of respect to be shown 
them. 

3180. The lady of the house sits at 
the head of the table, and the gentle- 
man opposite, at the foot. The place of 
hon^r for gentlemen is on each side of 
the mistress of the house for ladies, 
on each side of the master. The com- 
pany should be so arranged that each 
lady will have some gentleman at her 
side to assist her. Of course it is every 
gentleman's duty, first of all to see that 
ladies near him are attended to. 

3181. When napkins are provided, 
they are at once carefully unfolded, 
and laid on the knees. Observe if 
grace is to be said, and keep a proper 
decorum. If soup is served, take a 
piece of bread in the left hand, and the 
spoon in the right, and sip noiselessly 
from the side of the spoon. Do not 



S92 



WILLIAM H. HARRISOK 1841 : DIED THE SAME YEAR. 



take two plates of the same kind of 
soup, and never tip up the plate. 

3182. When regular courses are 
served, the next dish is fish. If silver 
or wide-pronged forks are used, eat 
with the fork in the right hand- the 
knife is unnecessary. 

3183. Next come the roast and boil- 
ed meats. If possible, the knife should 

never be put in the mouth at all, let 
the edge be turned outward. Anything 
taken into the mouth not fit to be 
swallowed, should be 'quietly removed 
with the fingers of the left hand, to that 
Bide of the plate. The teeth should be 
picked as little a-s possible, and never 
with the fork or fingers. Carefully ab- 
stain from every act of observation that 
may cause disgust, such as spitting, 
blowing the nose, gulping, rinsing the 
mouth, &c. Should a gentleman send 
you wine at a public table, or ask the 
honour of a glass with you, observe 
when he raises his glass, and do the 
same, bowing, whether you drink or 
not. 

3184. When the ladies leave the ta- 
ble, which they do together at the sig- 
nal of the mistress of the house, the gen- 
tlemen rise and conduct them to the 
door of the apartment, and then return 
to the table. This is in formal parties. 

3185. If at dinner you are requested 
to help any one to sauce, do not pour it 
over the meat or vegetables, but on one 
side. If you should have to carve and 
help a joint, do not load a person's 
plate it is vulgar: also in serving 
soup, one ladleful to each plate is suffi- 
cient. 

3186. Eat peas with a dessert spoon, 
and curry also. Tarts and puddings 
are to be eaten with a spoon. 

3187. As a general rule, in helping 
any one at table, never use a knife 
when you can use a spoon. 

3188. Making a noise in chewing, or 
breathing hard in eating, are both un- 
seemly habits, and ought to be eschew- 
ed. 

3189. Never pare an apple or a pear 
for a lady unless she desires you, and 
then bo careful to use your fork to hold 



it ; you may sometimes offer to divide a 
very large pear with or for a person. 

3190. At some tables, large colored 
glasses, partially filled with water, 
with a bit of lemon, are brought when 
the cloth is removed. You dip a cor- 
ner of the napkin in the water, and 
wipe your mouth, then rinse your fin- 
gers and wipe them on your napkin. 

3J91. The best general rule for a 
person unacquainted with the usages oi 
society, is to be cautious, pay attention 
and do as he sees others do, who ought 
to know what is proper. Most of our 
blunders are the result of haste and 
want of observation. 

3192. FOUR GOOD POINTS. 
These were earnestly recommended by 
a wise and good man, and enforced by 
his own example. They are essentially 
necessary for the management of tem- 
poral concerns. These are : 

1. Punctuality. 

2. Accuracy. 

3. Steadiness. 

4. Dispatch. 

Without the first, time is wasted. 

Without the second, mistakes, fatal 
to our own interest and that of others, 
may be committed. 

Without the third, nothing can be 
well done. 

Without the fourth, opportunities 
of good are lost which it is impossible 
to recall. 

3193. FOUR IMPORTANT 
RULES. 

1. A suitable place for everything, 
and everything in its place. 

2. A proper time for everything, and 
everything done in its time. 

3. A distinct name for everything, 
and everything called by its name. 

4. A certain use for everything, and 
everything put to its use. 

3194. TABLE OF WEIGHTS 
AND MEASURES. 

3195. Men are often measured by 
weight of intellect or character, which 
is very diversified, but not more than 
the weights and measures of men in 
different regions, by which they measure 
merchandise and produce to one au 



JOHN TYLER'S TERM OF OFFICE 1841 TO 1845. 



other. For instance, a BARREL 
MEASURE. 

3196. What is it? This it IB, when 
selling the following articles : 

3197. Cixler and other liquids, 30 
gallons. Rice, 600 Ibs. Flour, 196 
Ibs. Powder, 25 Ibs, Corn, as bought 
and sold in Kentucky, Tennessee, &c., 
5 bushels of shelled corn. As bought 
and sold a New-Orleans, a flour barrel 
full of ears Potatoes, as sold in New- 
York, a k./rel contains 2^ bushels. 
Pork, a barrel is 200 Ibs., distinguished 
in quality by " clear," " mess," " prime." 
A barrel of beef is the same weight. 

3198. A barrel of salt, in one place, 
is 280 Ibs., and in another " five bush- 
els," though in measuring the bushel, 
cubic inches are not resorted to, but 
pounds, arbitrarily calling a bushel of 
salt 56 Ibs. in one place, and 50 Ibs. in 
another. 

3199. A BUSHEL MEASURE. The 
legal bushel of America is the old 
Winchester measure of 2,150.42 cubic 
inches. The imperial bushel of Eng- 
land is 2,218.142 cubic inches; so that 

32 English bushels are about equal to 

33 of ours. 

3200. Although we are all the time 
talking about the price of grain, &c., 
by the bushel, we sell by weight, UB 
follows : 

3201. Wheat, beans, potatoes, and 
clover seed, 60 Ibs. Corn, rye, flax- 
seed, and onions, 56 Ibs. Corn on the 
cob, 70 Ibs. Buckwheat, 52 Ibp. Bar- 
ley, 48 Ibs. Hemp seed, 44 Ibs. 
Timothy seed, 45 Ibs. Castor beans, 
46 Ibs. Oats, 35 Ibs. Bran, 20 Ibs. 
Blue grass seed, 14 Ibs. Salt ; the real 
weight of coarse salt is 85 Ibs. Dried 
apples, 24 Ibs. Dried peaches, 33 Ibs. 
according to some rules, but others 
are 22 IDS. for a bushel, while in 
Indiana, dried apples and peaches 
are sold by the heaping bushel. So 
are potatoes, turnipe, onions, apples. 
&c., and in some sections oats are 
heaped. A bushel of corn in the ear is 
throe heaped half bushels, or four even 
full. 

3202. In Tennessee, a hundred ears 



of corn is sometimes counted as a 
bushel. At Chester, England, a bushel 
is 32 gallons; at Carlisle, 24 gallons; 
at Penrith, 16 gallons ; at Abbingtou, 9 
gallons. 

3203. A hoop 18 inches diameter, b 
inches deep, holds a Winchester bushel. 
A box 12 inches square, 7 and 7 1-32 
deep, will hold half a bushel. A heap- 
ing bushel is 2.815 cubic inches. 

3204. A GALLON MEASURE. An 
English imperial gallon is 10 Ibs. of 
distilled water at 62 Fahrenheit, when 
the barometer stands at 30. This is 
277.274 cubic inches. The old wine 
measure in use here is 231 inches ; and 
" beer measure" 282 inches. 

3205. The question, if asked: "What 
is a gallon measure?" can only be 
answered by measuring the man who is 
buying or selling. 

3206. LAND MEASURE. An English 
imperial acre is 4,840 square yards, or 
160 square rods. A square 13 rods 
upon each side is commonly counted an 
acre ; it is nine rods over measure. A 
square 22 yards upon each side is one- 
tenth of an acre. 

3207. The following gives the com- 
parative size in square yards of acres in 
different countries : 

English acre , 4,840 square yards ; 
Scotch, 6,150 ; Irish, 7,840 ; Hamburg, 
11,545; Amsterdam, 9,722; Dantzic, 
6,650; France (hectare), 11,960; 
Prussia (morgen), 3,053. 

This difference should be borne in 
mind in reading of the products per 
acre in different countries. Our land 
measure is that of England. 

3208. GOVERNMENT LAND MEAS- 
URE. A township, 36 sections, each a 
mile square. 

A section, 640 acres. 

A quarter section, half a mile iquare, 
160 acres. 

An eighth section, half a mile long-, 
lorth and south, and a quarter of a 
mile wide, 80 acres. 

A sixteenth section, a quarter of a 
mile square, 40 acres. 

The sections aie all numbered one if

The sections are all divided in 
quarters, which are named by the car- 
dinal points, as in section one. The 
quarters are divided in the same way. 
The description of a 40 acre lot would 
read : The south half of the west half 
of the southwest quarter of section 1 in 
township 24, north of range 7 west, or 
as the case might be ; and sometimes 
will fall short, and sometimes overrun 
the number of acres it is supposed to 
contain. 

3209. A MILE MEASURE. A stand- 
ard English mile, which is the measure 
that we use, is 5,280 feet in lengtn, 
1.760 yards, or 320 rods. A strip one 
rod wide and one mile long, is two 
ac.res. By this it is easy to calculate 
the quantity of land* taken up by roads, 
and also how much is wasted by 
fences. 

3210. The following table shows the 
length of miles in different countries, 
compared with the English mile :

a tun is 2,000 Ibs. In most places, a 
tun of hay, &c., is 2,240 Ibs., and in 
some places that foolish fashion still 
prevails of weighing all bulky articles 
sold by the tun, by the " long weight," 
or tare of 12 Ibs. per cwt.

In this country, a load is just what it 
may happen to weigh ; and a tun of hay 
is either 2,000 Ibs. or 2,240, according 
to the custom of the locality, A bale 
of hay is generally considered about

It is also sold by the barrel. A load of 
wood in New-York is 42 cubic feet, or 
one-third of a cord. 

Wood is sold in England by the

upon as a welcome guest when it is not 
in a dull mood. 

3235. The oldest riddle on record is 
that put forth by Samson (Judges xiv.) 
' Out of the eater came forth meat, 
and out of the strong came forth sweet- 
ness." His solution is well known, as 
it is explained in the same chapter. 

3236. No doubt there are many rid- 
dles which should have been handed 
down to posterity, that deserved this dis- 
tinction, but that ascribed to Cieobulus, 
one of the seven wise men of Greece, 
deserves to be recorded ; it is said to 
have been composed B. c. about 705 
years. " There is a father with twice 
six sons: these sons have thirty daugh- 
ters a-piece, parti-colored, having one 
check white and the other black, who 
never see each other's face, nor live 
above twenty-four hours." His solu- 
tion was " The Year." 

How we have puzzled and puzzled 
again over some of the good old riddles 
of yore, and when their solutions have 
been whispered, half in mirth and half 
in fear at our wrath, we have laughed

3239. A PROBLEM FOR ARITHME- 
TICIANS. A. and B., two countrymen, 
came to the New York market with 
30 geese each. A. sells his 30 geese 
at the rate of TWO for $1, and B. sells 
his 30 geese at the rate of THREE for 
$1, at which rate the purchaser seems 
to get FIVE geese for $2. The net 
proceeds of the sales, however, amount- 
ed to $25. Subsequently A. and B. 
have another lot of thirty geese each 
for the market, but as A. is sick, he 
gets B. to sell his lot, who comes to the 
market, and believing that he was sell- 
ing his geese on the same terms as be- 
fore, offers them at the rate of FIVE 
for $2. When he returns home, he 
finds, in making up his account with A., 
that he has only netted $24 for the 
sixty geese, and is out $1, but cannot 
account for the deficiency. In the first 
instance, the sixty geese brought $25 ; 
tn the second, only $24, and yet he has 
apparently sold them on the same 
terms FIVE for $2, as they sold them 
in the first place THREE for $1, and 
TWO for $1 FIVE for $2. Can any 
of our smart men at figures account for 
the deficiency of $1 on the second 
sale? 

Answer. The solution of the problem 
of the geese is very simple. It is true 
that the buyer of the geese from A., at 
two for $2, and from B. at three for 
$1, obtains five for $2. But when B. 
has sold all of his geese, having received 
$10 for his 30, A. has only sold 20 for 
the same money, and has ] left at the 
rate of two for $1. Thus, when A. has 
sold only 20, the rate of five for $2 
ceases; being two for $1, or four for 
$2, for the remaining ten belonging to 
A. Therefore this accounts for the dif 
ference o r $1 between the two sale*

they amount to 100. 15

3241. PRACTICAL PUZZLE. It is 
required to name the quotient of five 
or three lines of figures each line con- 
sisting of five or more figures only 
seeing the first line, before the other 
lines are even put down. Any person 
may write down the first line of figures 
for you. How do you find the quotient? 
Answer. When the first line of fig- 
ures is set down, subtract 2 from the 
last right-hand figure, and place it be- 
fore the first figure of the line, and that 
is the quotient for five lines. For ex- 
ample, suppose the figures given are 
86,214, the quotient will be 286,212. 
You may allow any person to put down 
the two first and the fourth lines, but 
you must always set down the third 
and fifth lines, and in doing so always 
make up 9 with the line above, as in 
the following example : 

Therefore in the annexed 
86,214 diagram you will see that 
42,680 you have made 9 in the 
57,319 third and fifth lines with 
62,854 the lines above them. If 
37,145 the person desired to put 

- down the figure, should 
Qt. 286,212 set a 1 or for the last 

figure, you must say we 
will have another figure, and another, 
and so on until he sets down something 
above 1 or 2. 

In solving the puzzle 
67,856 with three lines, you sub- 
47,218 tract 1 from the last figure, 
52,781 arid place it before the first 

figure, and make up the 
Qt 167,855 third line yourself to 9. 

For example : 67,856 is 
given, and the quotient will be 167,355, 
&B shown in the above diagram. 



3242. To TELL ANY NUMBER 
THOUGHT OF. Ask a person to think 
of a number ; then tell him to subtract 
1 from that number ; now tell him to 
multiply the remainder by 2 ; then re- 
quest him again to subtract 1, and add 
to the remainder the number he first 
thought of, and to inform you of the 
total. When he has done this, you 
must mentally add three to that total, 
and then divide it by 3, and the quo- 
tient will be the number first thought 
of. This is an excellent arithmetical 
pastime, examples of which we give 
below :

3243. THE EXPUNGED FIGURE. 
In the first place desire a person to 
write down secretly, in a line, any 
number of figures he may choose, and 
add them together as units ; having 
done this, tell him to subtract that 
sura from the line of figures originally 
set down; then desire him to strike 
out any figure he pleases, and add the 
remaining figures in the line together 
as units (as in the first instance), and 
inform you of the result, when you will 
tell him the figure ho has struck out. 

Suppose, for example, the 

76542 24 figures put down are 76542; 

24 . these, added together, as 

unite, make a total of 24 ; 

76518 deduct 24 from the first 

line, and 76518 will remain ; 

if the 5, the centre figure, be Btruck 



398 



NEVER PUT OFF TILL TO-MORROW WHAT CAN BE DONE TO-DAY. 



out, the total will be 22. If 8, the first 
figure be struck oirt, 19 will be the 
total. 

In order to ascertain which figure 
has been struck out, you make a men- 
tal sum one multiple of 9 higher than 
the total given. If 22 be given as the 
total, then 3 times 9 are 27, and 22 
from 27 shows that 5 was struck out. 
If 19 be given, that sum deducted from 
^7 shows 8. 

Should the total be equal multiples 
of 9, as 18, 27, 36, then 9 has been ex- 
punged. 

With very little practice any person 
may perform this with rapidity ; it is 
therefore needless to give any further 
examples. 

3244. THE REMAINDER. A very 
pleasing way to arrive at an arithmet- 
ical sum, without the use of either slate 
or pencil, is to ask a person to think of 
a figure, then to double it, then add a 
certain figui-e to it, now halve the whole 
sum, and finally to subtract from that 
the figure first thought of. You are 
then to tell the thinker what is the re- 
mainder. 

The key to this lock of figures is, 
that half of whatever sum you require 
to be added during the working of the 
sum is the remainder. In the example 
given, five is the half of ten, the num- 
ber requested to be added. Any 
amount may be addod, but the opera- 
tion is simplified by giving only even 
numbers, as they will divide without 
fractions.

how the six persons can transport thorn 
selves over the river in pairs, so that 
no woman shall be left in company with 
any of the men unless her husband is 
present. 

Answer. At first two wives cross 
the river, then one returns and takes 
over the remaining wife, after which she 
recrosses, and stays with her husband, 
and the two husbands cross over. 
Then a husband and wife come back, 
and the two husbands cross. Then 
the wife returns and takes over one of 
the others, and lastly the husband of 
the remaining one comes back for hia 
wife. (See 2435.) 

3246. TECHNICAL TERMS RELA- 
TIVE TO BOOKS, ENGRAV-

3265. How TO GET A HORSE OUT 
OF A FIRE The great difficulty of 
getting horses from a stable where 
surrounding buildings are in a state of 
conflagration, is well known. The 
plan of covering their eyes with a 
blanket will not always succeed. 

3266. A gentleman whose horses 
have been in great peril from such a 
cause, having in vain tried to save them, 
hit upon the experiment of having 
them harnessed as though they were 
going to their usual work, when, to his 
astonishment, they were led from the 
stable without difficulty.

Boil castor oil with an equal quantity 
of milk, sweetened with a little sugar. 
Stir it well and let it cool. Another 
good way is to beat the castor oil with 
the white of an egg until both are 
thoroughly mixed. In either case the 
taste of oil cannot be distinguished. 

3269. To ascertain the height of an 
object a peculiar method of measure- 
merit is in use among the Isthmus In-

a tree, for instance, a man proceeds 
from its base to a point where, on turn- 
ing the back towards it, and putting- 
the head between the legs, he can just 
see the top ; at the spot where he is 
able to do this he makes a mark on the 
ground, and then paces the distance to 
the base -of the tree : this distance is 
equal to the height.

taken out by wetting the spots in milk, 
then covering them with common salt. 
It should be done before the garment 
has beea washed. Another way to 
take out ink, is to dip it in melted tal- 
low. For fine, delicate articles, this is 
the best way. (See 175.) 

3272. Mildew may be removed, by 
dipping the article in sour buttermilk, 
laying in the sun, and after it is white, 
rinsing in fair water. Soap and starch, 
with half as much salt as there is 
starch. The juice of lemon is very 
good. (See 506.J 

3273. To Remove Stains from Broad- 
cloth. Take an ounce of pipe-clay, 
that has been ground fine, and mix it 
with twelve drops of alcohol, and the 
same quantity of spirits of turpentine. 
Moisten a little of this mixture with 
alcohol, and rub it on the spots. Let 
it remain till dry, then rub it off with a 
woollen cloth, and the spots will dis- 
appear. (See 1286 and 27.) 

3274. To Remove Stains from Colored 
Silks. Salts of ammonia, mixed with 
lime, will take out the stains of wine 
from silk. Spirits of turpentine, al- 
cohol, and clear ammonia, are all good 
to remove stains on colored silks. 

3275. Spirits of Hartshorn, diluted 
with an equal quantity of water, will 
often remove stains made by acids, tea, 
wine or fruits. It may be necessary to 
repeat several times. (See 42.) 

3276. To Extract Paint from Goods. 
Saturate the spot with pure spirits 
of turpentine, and let it remain several 
hours, then rub it between the hands. 
It w r ill crumble away, without injuring 
either the color or texture of the 
article. 

3277. For Fruit and Wine Stains, 
mix two teaspoonfuls of water and 
one of spirit of salt, and let the stained 
part lie in this for two minutes : then 
rinse in cold water ; or wet the stain 
with hartshorn. (See 1290 and 450 J

the body open. If these are generally 
attended to, the physician's aid would 
seldom be required. 

3279. Excellent, cheap Whitewash. 
Slack the lime as usual, except that the 
water used should be hot, and nearly 
saturated with salt ; then stir in four 
handfuls of tine sand, to make it thick 
like cream. Coloring matter can be 
added to both, making a light stone 
colour, a cream colour, or a light buff. 
(See 190.) 

3280. Cheap Paint for a Barn. An 
excellent and cheap paint for rough 
wood-work is made of six pounds of 
melted pitch, one pint of linseed oil, and 
one pound of brick-dust or yellow ochre. 

3281. To promote the growth of 
whiskers, moustaches, etc. The best 
method to force the growth of whiskers 
and moustaches is to shave the parts 
frequently. Use as a stimulant the 
ashes of burned tobacco, and bay- 
water. 

3282. Night Sweats. Drink freely 
of cold sage tea ; said to be a certain 
remedy ; or, take elixir of vitriol in a 
little sweetened water. Dose, from 
twenty to thirty drops. 

3283. Palpitation of the Heart. 
Take from ten to fifteen drops, three 
times a day, of the tincture of stra- 
monium ; or, take the tincture of gum 
guaiacum. Dose, a teaspoonful twice 
a day, in a little milk. 

3284. Fever and Ague. Take of 
cloves and cream of tartar, each half 
an ounce, and one ounce Peruvian 
bark, mix in a little tea, molasses or 
honey, and take it on the well days, in 
such quantities as the stomach will bear. 

3285. Ague Medicine. Rhubarb, 
colurnba, and essence peppermint, each 
1 oz. ; 1 pint of water ; 45 grains 
quinine. Table-spoonful once an hour 
until it operates as physic. Then, 
Bame amount three times a day. To 
keep, add one gill of whisky. 

3286. Felon, or Whitlow. Soak the 
finger in a strong, warm lye of ashes, 
for half an hour at a time, frequently. 
Or, make use of poultices in connec- 
tion with lye. (See 2301.) 



3287. Cure for Cattle Swelled with 
Green Food. When any of your cattle 
happen to get swelled with an over 
feed of clover, frosty turnips, or such 
like, instead of the usual method of 
stabbing in the side, apply a dose of 
train-oil, which, after repeated trials, 
has been found to prove successful. 
The quantity of oil must vary accord- 
ing to the age or size of the animal. 
For a grown-up beast, of ordinary size, 
the quantity recommended is about an 
English pint. 

3288. HOW TO *DRESS WITH 

TASTE. 

3289. The importance of dress can 
scarcely be overrated, but by compar- 
ison. It is with the world the outward 
sign of both character and condition ; 
and since it costs no more to dress well 
than ill, and is not very troublesome, 
every one should endeavor to do the 
best that his circumstances will allow. 

3290. A clean, unrumpled shirt 
coarse or fine, cotton or linen as you 
can afford, is of the first importance. 
If the choice is between a fine shirt or 
a fine coat, have the shirt by all means. 
A well-bred man may be ever so re- 
duced in his wardrobe his clothes 
may be coarse and thread-bare, but he 
seldom wears a coarse, and never a 
dirty shirt. 

3291. Boots are now men's common 
wear on all occasions, varying in ele- 
gance for different purposes. They 
should always be clean, and invariably 
well blackened and polished. 

3292. Make a point of buying a good 
hat. One proper fur hat worth four or 
five dollars, when a year old, looks 
more respectable than a silk one bought 
yesterday. 

3293. Be as particular as you like 
about the cut of your pantaloons Run 
into no extravagances of bell-bottoms, 
or puckered waists. Buy strong cloth, 
that will not be tearing at every turn ; 
and if you consult economy and taste 
at the same time, let them be either 
black or very dark gray, when they 
will answer upon all occasions. 

3294. The vest allows of some fane' 



402

but beware of being too fanciful. A 
black satin is proper for any person or 
any occasion. Nothing is more elegant 
than pure white. Some quiet colours 
may be worn for variety, but beware 
of everything staring or glaring, in 
materials or trimmings. 

3295. If you have but one coat, it 
will be a black dress coat, as there are 
occasions where no other will answer. 
Frock coats are worn in the morning, 
riding, or walking, but never at evening 
visits, or at weddings, balls, parties, or 
the opera. Overcoats are worn for 
comfort ; they need not be fine, -and 
should not be fanciful. Stocks are 
pretty much out of use. Most gentle- 
men wear a simple, plain black silk 
cravat, neatly tied in a bow-knot before. 
Balls and parties require white or light 
kid gloves. Black or very dark ones, 
of kid, silk or linen, are worn upon all 
other occasions, except in driving, 
when buff leather gloves are prefer- 
able. 

3296. The best-dressed men wear 
the least jewelry. Of all things, avoid 
ehowy chains, large rings, and flashy 
gewgaw pins and brooches. All these 
things should be left to negroes, Indians, 
and South Sea Islanders. 

3297. The most proper pocket-hand- 
kerchiefs are of white linen. If fig- 
ured or bordered, it should be very 
delicately. 

3298. Gloves are worn in the street, 
at church, and places of amusement. 
It is not enough to carry them they 
are to be worn. 

3299. Ladies are allowed to consult 
fancy, variety, and ornament, more than 
men, yet -nearly the same rules apply. 
It is the mark* of a lady to be always 
well shod. If your feet are small, 
don't spoil them by pinching if large, 
squeezing them makes them worse. 
Be as moderate as you can about 
bustles. While it is the fashion you 
must wear them, but don't lay them on 
too thick. Abov all, as you regard 
nealth, comfort, and beatty, do not lace 
too tightly. A waist too small for the 
natural proportion of the figure ?s the 



worst possible deformity, and produces 
many others. No woman who Incea 
tight can have good shoulders, a straight 
spine, good lungs, sweet breath, or is 
fit to be a wife and mother. 

3300. The most elegant dresses are 
black or white. Common modesty will 
prevent indecent exposure of tho 
shoulders and bosom. A vulgar girl 
wears bright and glaring colours, fantas- 
tically made, a large flaring-, red, yellow, 
or sky-blue hat, covered with a rainbow 
of ribbons, and all the rings and trinkets 
she can load upon her. Of course, a 
modest, well-bred young lady, chooses 
the reverse of all this. In any assem- 
blage, the most plainly-dressed woman 
is sure to be the most ladylike and at- 
tractive. Neatness is better than rich- 
ness, and plainness better than display. 
Single ladies dress less in fashionable 
society than married ones : and all more 
plainly and substantially for walking or 
travelling, than on other occasions. 

3301. In our opinion, nothing beyond 
a simple natural flower ever adds to the 
beauty of a lady's head-dress. 

3302. It is a general rule, applicable 
to both sexes, that persons are the best 
.dressed when you cannot remember 
how they were dressed. Avoid every- 
thing out of the way, uncommon, or 
grotesque. (See 1822.)

3304. RULES FOR A SICK ROOM. 

3305. Keep the patient, and all 
about him, perfectly clean, and secure, 
as far as possible, pure air. The cham- 
ber should be ventilated at least once a 
day, or twice if it can be borne. The 
bed clothes should be carried out into 
the open air, if it is dry, if not, into the 
next room ; and if the patient is unable 
k> sit up meanwhile, let them be sup- 
plied by others. 

3306. Keep the room quiet, and in 
perfect order. 

3307. Let the sick be addressed in 
a gentle voice, and the conversation, if 
any is admitted, be pleasant and cheer- 
ing. The nurse and friends should ex- 
press sympathy with the sufferer, but 
at the same time seek to inspire cour- 
age, and patience to endure. 

3308. All vials and powders should 
be labelled, to prevent fatal mistakes. 

3309. The beds should be made at 
least once a day, and if the patient can 
bear it, twice. Carry the beds out 
into the open air, or if damp, into an- 
other room. 

3310. Keep the skin clean by daily 
ablutions ; change the garments fre- 
quently, and rinse the mouth often. 

3311. A nurse should be of a pleasant, 
agreeable, persuasive, and even temper, 
with great patience to bear with the 
whims and unreasonable fretfulness 
that often appear in the sick. 

331:2. Never dispute with a very sick 
person, nor reprove him for any seeming 
inconsistency. Remember that he is 
nardly a responsible being. 

3313. POULTICES. (Ser2199.) 



3314. Bread Poultice. Take stale 
bread in crumbs, pour boiling water 
over it, and boil till soft, stirring it well ; 
then take it from the tire, and gradually 
stir in a little hog's lard or sweet oil, 
so as to render the poultice pliable 
when applied. 

3315. Corn-Meal Poultice. Indian 
meal, five tabbspoonfuls ; rye flour, 
one tablespoonful. To be gradually 
let through the fingers into boiling wa- 
ter, briekly stirring at the same time. 
Then add a little oil, as for the bread- 
poultice. 

3316. Apple Poultice. Apples pared, 
cored, and well boiled, then well wash- 
ed into a pulp, form a very good poul- 
tice. 

3317. Starch Poultice. Starch, any 
quantity ; thicken with boiling water. 
When a little cool, stir in a little lard 
or oil. 

3318. Slippery Elm Poultice. T&ke 
slippery elm in powder, and mix with 
water until somewhat thick, then boil 
it a few minutes. It is to be applied 
warm. 

3319. Yeast Pou/fice. Wheat flour, 
one pound ; yeast, half a pint. Mix 
them together over a gentle heat until 
the mixture begins to rise, then apply 
warm. 

3320. Mustard Poultice. Flour of 
mustard, one part ; flaxseed meal, one 
part. Make into a paste with water. 
A little oil or lard should be added to 
prevent its sticking. 

3321. Poultice made of Hops. Boil 
a handful of hops for a few minutes in 
a pint of water, in a covered vessel, 
squeeze out the juice and strain. This 
liquor is now to be put again on the 
fire and thickened with Indian meal, 
and a little lard added as it becomes 
cool. 

3322. Spice Poultice.- Cinnamon, 
allspice, cloves, and g'.nger, of each 
equal quantities ; honey or molasses to 
mix. 

3323. Alum Poultice. Put the white 
of a couple of eggs into a plate, and 
then with a piece of alum between the 

i humb and finger stir it into a curd 



404 



NOTHING IS TROUBLESOME THAT WE DO WILLINGLY. 



To be applied wrapped in a fine piece 
of linen, having but one fold next tire 
skin. 

3324. An excellent Poultice for old 
Sores. Scrape yellow carrots, wilt 
them on a pan or fire shovel, very soft. 
It takes out the inflammation and 
swelling, and is an excellent poultice 
for a sceris breast. 

3325. Salte for Sore Breasts. Take 
one pound tobacco, one pound spike- 
nard, half a pound of cum trey, and boil 
them in three quarts of chamber-ley till 
almost dry ; squeeze out the juice, add 
to it pitch and bees-wax, and simmer it 
over a moderate heat to the consistence 
of salve. Apply it to the part affected. 
(Sec 2175.) 

3326. HOW TO GET RICH. 
What will my readers give to know 
how to get rich ? Now, I will not 
vouch that the following rules will 
enable every person who may read 
them to acquire wealth, but this I will 
answer for, that if ever a man does 
grow rich by honest means, and re- 
tains his wealth for any length of time, 
he must practice upon the principles 
laid down in the following essay. The 
remarks are not original with me, but I 
strongly commend them to the atten- 
tion of every young man, at least as 
affording the true secret of success in 
attaining wealth. A single perusal of 
Buch an essay, at an impressible mo- 
ment, has sometimes a very wonder- 
ful effect upon the disposition and 
character. 

3327. Fortune, they say. is a fickle 
dame full of her freaks and caprices ; 
who blindly distributes her favors with- 
out the , slightest discrimination. So 
inconstant, so wavering is she repre- 
sented, that her most faithful votaries 
can place no reliance on her promises. 
Disappointment, they tell us, is the lot 
of those who make offerings at her 
Bhrine. Now, all this is a vile slander 
Upon the dear blind lady. 

3328. Although wealth often appears 
the result of mere accident, or a fortu- 
nate concurrence of favorable circum- 
stance*, vuthout any exertion of skill 



or foresight, yet CVIMV man of pound 
health and unimpaired mind may be- 
come wealthy, if he takes the proper 
steps. 

3329. Foremost in the list of requi 
sites, are honesty and strict integrity in 
every transaction of life. Let a man 
have the reputation of being fair and 
upright in his dealings, and he will 
possess the confidence of all who know 
him. Without these qualities, every 
other merit will prove unavailing. Ask 
concerning a man,. " Is he active and 
capable?" Yes. "Industrious, tem- 
perate, and regular in his habits?" 
O, yes. "Is he honest? is he trust- 
worthy?" Why, as to that, I am 
sorry to say that he is not to be trusted ; 
he wants watching ; he is a little tricky, 
and will take an undue advantage, if he 
can. " Then I will have nothing to do 
with him;" will be the invariable re- 
ply. Why, then, is honesty the beet 
policy ? Because, without it, you will 
get a bad name, and everybody will 
shun you. 

3330. A character for knavery will 
prove an insurmountable obstacle to 
success in almost every undertaking. 
It will be found that the straight line 
is, in business, as in geometry, the 
shortest. In a word, it is almost im- 
possible for a dishonest man to acquire 
wealth by a regular process of business, 
because he is shunned as a depredator 
upon society. 

3331. Needy men are apt to deviate 
from the rule of integrity, under the 
plea that necessity knows no law : they 
might as well add that it knows no 
shame. The course is suicidal, and by 
destroying all confidence, ever keep'p 
them immured in poverty, although 
they may possess every other quality 
for success in the world. 

3332. Punctuality, which is said to be 
the soul of business, is another import- 
ant element in the art of money-getting'. 
The man known to be scrupulously 
exact in the fulfillment of his engage- 
ments, gains the confidence of all, and 
may command all the means he cau 
use to advantage ; whereas, a man care 



HOW MUCH PAIN THE EVILS HAVE COST US THAT 11AVC NEVER HAPPENED. 405 



less and regardless of his promises in 
money matters will have every purse 
closed against him. Therefore be 
prompt in your payments. 

3343. Next, let'us consider the ad- 
vantages of a cautious circumspection 
in our intercourse with the world. 
Slowness of belief, and a proper dis- 
trust are essential to success. The 
credulous and confiding are ever the 
dupes of knaves and impostors. Ask 
those who have lost their property, 
how it happened, and you will find 
IB most cases it has been owing to 
misplaced confidence. One has lost by 
endorsing ; another by crediting ; an- 
other by false representations ; all of 
which a little more foresight and a 
little more distrust would have pre- 
vented. In the affairs of this world, 
men are not saved by faith, but by the 
want of it. 

3344. Judge of men by what they 
do, not by what they say. Believe in 
looks, rather than in words. Observe 
all their movements. Ascertain their 
motives and their ends. Notice what 
they say or do in their unguarded mo- 
ments, when under the influence of 
excitement. The passions have been 
compared to tortures, which force men 
te reveal their secrets. Before trust- 
ing a man, before putting it in his 
power to cause you a loss, possess 
yourself of every available information 
relative to him. Learn his history, 
his habits, inclinations and propensi- 
ties ; hie reputation for honesty, in- 
dustry, frugality, and punctuality; his 
prospects, resources, supports, advan- 
tages and disadvantages ; his intentions 
and motives of action; who are his 
friends and enemies, and what are his 
good or bad qualities. You may learn 
a man's good qualities and advantages 
from his friends his bad qualities and 
disadvantages from nis enemies. Make 
due allowance for exaggeration in both. 
Finally, examine carefully before en- 
gaging in anything, and act with energy 
afterwards. Have the hundred eyes of 
Argus beforehand, and the hundred 
hands of Briarius afterward* 



3345. Order and system in the man- 
agement of business must not be neg- 
lected. Nothing contributes more to 
dispatch. Have a place for everything 
and everything in its place ; a time for 
everything, and everything in its time 
Do first what presses most, and having 
determined what is to be done, and 
how it is to be done, lose no time in 
doing it. Without this method, all is 
huiry and confusion, little or nothing is 
accomplished, and business is attended 
to with neither pleasure nor profit. 

3346. A polite, affable deportment 
is recommended- Agreeable manners 
contribute powerfully to a man's suc- 
cess. Take two men, possessing equal 
advantages in every other respect, but 
let one be gentlemanly, kind, obliging, 
and conciliating in his manners; the 
other harsh, rude, and disobliging, and 
the one will become rich, while the 
other will starve. 

3347. We are now to consider a 
very important principle in the busi- 
ness of money-getting, namely In- 
dustry persevering, indefatigable at- 
tention to business. Persevering 
diligence is the Philosopher's stone, 



which turns everything to gold. Cou- 
, regular, habitual, and systematic 



stant, 



application to business must, in time, 
if properly directed, produce great 
results. It must lead to wealth, with 
the same certainty that poverty follows 
in the train of kiliaess and inattention 
It has been tru 1 .; remarked, that he 
who follows his amusements instead of 
his business, will, in a short time, have 
no business to follow. 

3348. The art of money-saving is an 
important part of the art of money- 
getting. Without frugality no one can 
become i-ich ; with it, few would be 
poor. Those who consume as fast as 
they produce, are on the road to ruin. 
As most of the poverty we meet with 
grows out of idleness and extravagance, 
I so most large fortunes have been the 
result of habitual industry and frugality. 
The practice of economy is as neces- 
sary in the expenditure. of t'rne as of 
money. They say that if "we tak 



406 



WHEN ANGRY, COUNT TEX BEFORE YOU SPEAK ; 



care of the pence, the pounds will take 
care of themselves." So, if we take 
care of the minutes, the days will take 
cure of themselves. 

3349. The acquisition of wealth de- 
mands as much self-denial, and as many 
sacrifices of present gratification, as 
the practice of virtue itself. Vice and 
poverty proceed, in some degree, from 
the same sources, namely the dispo- 
sition to sacrifice the future to the 
present ; the inability to forego a small 
present pleasure for great future advan- 
tages. Men fail of fortune in this 
world, as they fail of happiness in the 
world to come, simply because they 
are unwilling to deny themselves mo- 
mentary enjoyments for the sake of 
permanent future happiness. 

3350. Every large city is filled with 
persons, who, in order to support the 
appearance of wealth, constantly live 
beyond their income, and make up the 
deficiency by contracting debts which 
are never paid Others there are, 
the mere drones of society, who pass 
their days in idleness, and subsist by 
pirating on the hives of the industrious. 
Many who run a short-lived career of 
splendid beggary, could they but be 
persuaded to adopt a system of rigid 
economy for a few years, might pass 
the remainder of their days in affluence. 
But no ! They must keep up appear- 
ances, they must live like other folks. 

3351. Their debts accumulate; their 
credit fails ; they are harassed by duns, 
and besieged by constables and sheriffs. 
In this extremity, as a last resort, they 
submit to a shameful dependence, or 
engage in criminal practices, which en- 
tail hopeless wretchedness and infamy 
on themselves and families. 

3352. Stick to the business in which 
you are regularly employed. Let 
peculators make their thousands in a 
ye<;r or a day; mind your own regular 
trade, never turning 1 from it to the 
right hand or to the left. If you are 
a merchant, a professional man, or a 
mechanic, never buy lots or stocks 
unless you have surplus money which 
you wish to invest. Your own business 



you understand as well as other men ; 
but other people's business you dp not 
understand. Let your business bo 
some one which is useful to the com- 
munity. All such occupations pos- 
sess the elements of profit iu them- 
selves. (See 1827.)

3354. INDIAN BANNOCK. One 
pint of corn meal, one quart of milk ; 
boil the milk, and scald the meal thor- 
oughly. Beat up three eggs. Thin 
your dough to a batter with cold milk ; 
add a piece of butter half as large aa 
an egg ; put in your eggs with a little 
rialt; pour in shallow paps, and bake 
brown. This is a delicious breakfast 
cake. 

3355. To RESTORE SOUR MILK. 
Milk or cream may be sweetened after 

t has become slightly sour, by a email 
portion of carbonate of magnesia. 
Salaeratus, also, will correct the acid, 
but it slightly injures the flavor, unless 
very delicately managed. (See 816.)

3358. CURE FOR A BRUISE. The 
tincture of Arnica is one of the most 
effectual remedies for a bruise. Bathe 
with a sponge. It should not, how- 
ever, be used if the skin is broken. 
(See 2295.) 

3359. LOCAL OR RELATIVE TIME. 
Local time is that which is shown by 
our common clocks. It indicates the 
time at any given place, the meridian of 
that place being the standard from 
which it is reckoned ; therefore, the 
time or the clocks at any two places 
will differ by the difference of their 
meridians. Thus, when it is noon at 
New York, or when the Sun is on its 
meridian, the Sun at that instant at 
Washington is east of the meridian of 
that place, because the meridian of 
New York is east of Washington; 
therefore, the clocks at Washington 
will be earlier or slower than those in 
New York, by the time the Sun takes 
to go from the meridian of New York 
to the meridian of Washington viz., 
12 minutes 2 seconds. Hence, when it 
is 12 o'clock M. at New Orleans and 
St. Louis, it is 1 o'clock, P.M. at Phil- 
adelphia, which is a difference of one 
hour for every fifteen degrees of longi- 
tude. By this regulation, the Sun is 
made to come to the meridian of every 
place about 12 o'clock. It is incom- 
prehensible to many how it can be true 
that the Sun rises and sets at the same 
time at all places on the same latitude 
around the world. The difference of 
local time will account for this. It is 
not to be understood that when the sun 
rises at Boston at 6 o'clock, that it i 
then, at that instant of absolute time, 
rising at every place on the same lati- 
tude ; but that at all places on that 
latitude, when the Sun rises, it will be 
6 o'clock by the time-pieces of those places. 
The Sun will go from the horizon of 
Philadelphia, west to the horizon of 
St. Louis, in an hour.

behoof of authors and correctors for the Frees, a specimen of the manner in 
which the errors in a proofsheet should be marked on the margin. An atten 
tive etudy of the symbols and their interpretation will promote a good under 
tanding between the author and the printer :

3366. THE WEATHER ORACLE. 

(See 2070.) 

3367. FOR FINE AND DRY WEATHER 
OF LONG CONTINUANCE. If the wind 
bo north, north-west, or east, then veer 
to the north-east, remain there two or 
three days without rain, and then veer 
to the south without rain ; and if thence 
it change quickly, though perhaps with 
a little rain, to the nurth-east, and re- 
main there such fine weather will 
iaet occasionally for two months. 

3368. If there be dry weather with 
a weak south wind for five, six, or seven 
days, it having previously blown strong- 
ly from the same quarter 

18 



3369. If spiders, in spinning- thoil 
webs, make the terminating filaments 
long, we may, in proportion to their 
length, conclude that the weather will 
be serene, and continue so for ten 01 
twelve days. 

3370. If there are no falling stars to 
be seen on a bright summers evening 
you may look for fine weather. 

3371. If there be a change from con- 
tinued stormy or wet to clear and dry 
weather, at the time of new or full 
moon, or a short time before or after, 
and bo remain until the second day oi 
the new or f-ill moon, it is likely to re- 
main fine til die following quarter ; and 



412 



\VHEX ABUSED, A CURSE. 



if it change not then, or only for a very 
short time, it usually lasts until the fol- 
lowing new or full moon ; and if it does 
not change then, or only for a very 
short time, it is likely to continue fine 
and dry for four or five weeks. 

3372 If there be a change of weather 
at the time of the quarters, &c. (under 
the same circumstances as in No. 5), it 
will probably last for some time. 

3373. Spiders generally alter their 
webs once in 24 hours : if they do this 
between six and seven in the evening, 
there will be a fine night; if they alter 
their web in the morning, a fine day : 
if they work during rain, expect fine 
weather ; and the more active and 
busy the spider is, the finer will be the 
weather. 

3374. If near the full moon there be 
a general mist before sunrise ; or 

3375 If there be a sheep-sky, or 
white clouds driving to the north-west, 
it will be fine for some days. 
3376. FOR FINE WEATHER OF 
SHORTER DURATION. 

3377. If at sunrise many clouds 
are seen in the west, and then disap- 
pear. 

3378. If, before sunrise, the fields be 
covered with a mist. 

3379. If the clouds at sunrise fly to 
the west. 

3380. If at sunrise the sun be sur- 
rounded by an iris, or circle of white 
clouds. 

3381 . If there be red clouds in the 
west at sunset, it will be fine ; if they 
have a tint of purple, it will be very 
fine ; or if red, bordered with black in 
the south- east, 

3382. If there be a ring or halo 
round the sun in bad weather. 

3383. If the full moon rise clear. 
3:>S4. If there be clouds in the east 

in the evening.

duction, proof of pregnancy, and the 
birth of a child, is not essential. It is 
sufficient if the illness of the girl, 
whereby she was unable to labor, was 
produced by shame for the seduction ; 
and this is such a loss of service as will 
sustain the action. 

3595. Addressing to a wife a letter, 
containing matter defamatory to the 
character of her husband, is a publica- 
tion, and renders the writer amenable 
to damages. 

3596. A parent cannot sustain an 
action for any wrong done to a child, 
unless he has incurred some direct p*

cuniary injury therefrom, in conse- 
quence of some loss of service, or 
expenses necessarily consequent there- 
upon. 

3597. A master is responsible for an 
injury resulting from the negligence of 
his servant, whilst driving his cart or 
carriage, provided the servant is, at the 
time, engaged in his master's business, 
even though the accident happens in a 
place to which his master's business 
does not call him ; but if the journey 
of the servant be solely for a purpose 
of his own, and undertaken without the 
knowledge or consent of his master, 
the latter is not responsible. 

3598. An emigrant depot is not a 
nuisance in law. 

3599. A railroad track through the 
streets is not a nuisance in law. 

3600. In an action for libel, against a 
newspaper, extracts from such news- 
paper may be given to show its circu- 
lation, and the extent to which the 
libel has been published. The jury, in 
estimating the damages, are to look at 
the character of the libel, and whether 
the defendant is rich or poor. The 
plaintiff is entitled, in all cases, to his 
actual damages, and should be compen- 
sated for the mental sufferings endured, 
the public disgrace inflicted, and all 
other actual discomfort produced. 

3601. Delivery of a husband's goods 
by a wife to her adulterer, he having 
knowledge that she has taken them 
without her husband's authority, is 
fiufficient to sustain an indictment for 
larceny against the adulterer. 

3602. The fact that the insurer was 
not informed of the existence of im- 
pending litigation, affecting the premises 
insured, at the time the insurance 
was effected, does not vitiate the 
policy. 

3603. The liability of an innkeepfr is 
not confined to personal baggage, but 
extends to all the property of the guest 
that he consents to receive. 

3604. When a minor executes a con- 
tract, and pays money, or delivers proper- 
ty on the same, he cai not afterwards dis- 
affirm such contract and re.coj ->r the 



money, or property, unless he restores 
to the other party the consideration 
received from him for such money or 
property. 

3605. When a person has, by legal 
inquisition, been found an habitual 
drunkard, he cannot, even in his sober 
intervals, make contracts to bind him- 
self or his property, until the inquisi- 
tion is removed. 

3606. Any person dealing with the 
representative of a deceased person, is 
presumed, in law, to be fully apprized 
of the extent of such representative's 
authority to act in behalf of such 
estate. 

3607. In an action against a railroad 
company, by a passenger, to recover 
damages for injuries sustained on the 
road, it is not compulsory upon the 
plaintiff to prove actual negligence in 
the defendants ; but it is obligatory on 
the part of the latter to prove that the 
injury was not owing to any fault or 
negligence of theirs. 

3608. A guest is a competent witness, 
in an action between himself and an 
innkeeper, to prove the character and 
value of lost personal baggage. Money 
in a trunk, not exceeding the amount, 
reasonably required by the traveller to 
defray the expenses of the journey 
which he has undertaken, is a part of 
his baggage ; and in case of its JOSR, 
while at any inn, the plaintiff may prove 
its amount by his own testimony. 

3609. The deed of a minor is not ab- 
solutely void. The court is authorized 
to judge, from the instrument, whether 
it is void or not, according to its terms 
being favorable, or unfavorable, to the 
interests of the minor. 

3610. A married woman can neither 
sue nor be sued on any contract, made 
by her during her marriage. The ac- 
tion must be commenced either by or 
against her husband. It is only when 
an action is brought on a contract made 
by her before her mari'iage, that she is 
to be joined as a co plaintiff, or defend- 
ant, with her husband. 

3611. Any contract made with a per 
son judicially declared a lunatic is void 



420 



HIS STRENGTH IN WORDS THE BLUSTER VAINLY SPENDS, 



3612. Money paid voluntarily in any 
transaction, with a knowledge of the 
facts, cannot be recovered. 

3613. In all cases of special contrail 
for services, the plaintiff can recover 
only the amount stipulated in the con- 
tract. 

3614. A wife is a competent witness 
with her husband, to prove the contents 
of a lost trunk. 

3615. A wife cannot be convicted of 
receiving stolen goods when she re- 
ceived them of her husband. 

3616. Insurance against fire, b/ light- 
ning or otherwise, does not covsrloss 
by lightning when there is no com- 
bustion. 

3617. Failure to prove plea of justifi- 
cation, in a case of slander, aggravates 
the offence. 

3618. It is the agreement of the par- 
ties to sell by sample that constitutes 
a sale by sunnple, not the mere exhibi- 
tion of a specimen of the goods. 

3619. An agent is liable to his princi- 
pals for loss caused by his misstate- 
ments, though unintentional. 

3620. Makers of promissory notes given 
in advance for premiums on policies of 
insurance, thereafter to be taken, are 
liable thereon. 

3621. An agreement to pay for pro- 
curing an appointment to office, is 
void. 

3622. An attorney may plead the 
statute of limitations, when, sued by a 
client for money which he has collected 
and failed to pay over. 

3623. Testimony given by a deceased 
witness on first trial is not required to 
be repeated verbatim on the second. 

3624. A person entitling himself to 
a reward offered for lost property has a 
lien upon the property for the reward ; 
but only when a definite reward is 
offered. 

3625. Confession by a prisoner must 
be voluntarily made, to constitute evU 
donee against him. 

36'26. The defendant in a suit must 
be served with procees : but serrice 
of such process upon his wife, >ven 
vn his absence from tire State Is not. 



in the absence of statutory provisions, 
sufficient. 

3627. The measure of damages in 
trespass for cutting timber, is its value 
as a chattel on the land wheie it was 
felled, and not the market price of the 
lumber manufactured. 

3628. To support an indictment for 
malicious mischief in killing an animal, 
malice towards its owner must be 
shown, not merely passion excited 
against the animal itself. 

3629. No action can be maintainea 
against a Sheriff for omitting to account 
for money obtained upon an execution 
within a reasonable time. He has till 
the return day to render such account. 

3630. An interest in the profits of an 
enterprise, as profits, renders the party 
holding it a partner in the enterprise, 
and makes him presumptively liable to 
share any loss. 

3631. Males can marry at fourteen, 
and females at twelve years of age. 

3632. All cattle found at large upon 
any public road, can be driven by any 
person to the public pound. 

3633. Any dog chasing, barking or 
otherwise threatening a passer-by in 
any street, lane, road, or other public 
thoroughfare, may be lawfully killed 
for the same. 

3634. A written promise for the pay- 
ment of such amount as may come 
into the hands of the promisor, is held 
to be an instrument in writing for the 
payment of money. 

3635. The declaration of an agent 
is not admissible to establish the fact 
of agency. But when other proper 
evidence is given, tending to establish 
the fact of agency, it is not error to 
admit the declarations of the agent, 
accompanying acts, though tending to 
show the capacity in which he acted. 
When evidence is competent in one 
respect and incompetent in another, it 
is the duty of the court to admit it, 
and control its effects by suitable in- 
structions to the jury. 

3636. The court has a general 
power to remove or suspend an 
attornr for such immoral conduct ai

rendered him unworthy of confidence 
in his official capacity. 

3637. Bankruptcy is pleadable in 
bar to all actions and in all courts, 
and this bar may be avoided whenever 
it is interposed, by showing fraud in 
the procurement of the discharge, or 
a violation of any of the provisions of 
the bankrupt act. 

3638. An instrument in the form of 
B deed, but limited to take effect at 
the termination of the grantor's natural 
life, is held to be a deed, not a will. 

3639. A sale will not be set aside ae 
fraudulent, simply because the buyer 
was at the time unable to make the 
payment agreed upon, and knew his 
inability, and did not intend to pay. 

3640. No man is under an obliga- 
tion to make known his circumstances 
when he is buying goods. 

3641. Contracting parties are bound 
to disclose material facts known to 
each, but of which either supposes the 
other to be ignorant, only when they 
stand in some special relation of trust 
and confidence in relation to the sub- 
ject-matter of the contract. But 
neither will be protected if he does 
anything, however slight, to mislead or 
deceive the other. 

3642. A contract negotiated by 
mail is formed when notice of accept- 
ance of the offer is duly deposited in 
the post-office, properly addressed. 
This rule applies, although the party 
making the offer expressly requires 
that if it is accepted, speedy notice of 
acceptance shall be given him. 

3643. The date of an instrument is 
so far a r^aterial part of it, that an 
alteration of the date by the holder 
after exec'.tion, makes the instrument 
void. 

3644. A corporation may maintain 
an action for libel, for words published 
of them, and relating to its trade or 
business, by* which it has incurred 
special damagefe 

3645. It is unprofessional for a 
lawyer who has abandoned his case 
without trying it. a term or two before 
trial, to claim a fee conditional upon 



the success of his client, although his 
client was successful. 

3646. Although a party obtaining 
damages for injuries received through 
the default of another, was himself 
guilty of negligence, yet that will not 
defeat his recovery, unless his negli- 
gence contributed to cause the injury. 

3647. A person may contract to 
labor for another during life, in con- 
sideration of receiving his support; 
but his creditors have the right to 
inquire into the intention w r ith which 
such arrangement is made, and it 
will be set aside if entered into to de- 
prive them of his future earnings. 

3648. A grantor may by express 
terms exclude the bed of a river, or a 
highway, mentioned as a boundary : 
but if without language of exclusion a 
line is described as ' along,' or ' upon,' 
or as 'running to' the highway 01 
river, or as * by,' or running to the 
bank of ' the river : these expressions 
carry the grantee to the centre of the 
highway or river. 

3649. The court will take pains to 
construe the words used in a deed in 
such a way as to effect the intention of 
the parties, however unskillfully the 
instrument may be drawn. But a 
court of law cannot exchange an in- 
telligible word plainly employed in a 
deed for another, however evident it 
may be that the word used was used by 
mistake for another. 

3650. One who has lost his memory 
and understanding is entitled to legal 
protection, whether such loss is occa- 
sioned by his own misconduct or by an 
act of Providence. 

3651. When a wife leaves her hus- 
band voluntarily, it must be shown, in 
order to make him liable for necessa- 
ries furnished to her, that she could 
not stay with safety. Personal vio-? 
leneo, either threatened or inflicted, 
will be sufficient cause for such separa- 
tion. 

3652. Necessaries of drees furnished 
to a discarded wife must correspond 
with the pecuniary circumstances of 
the husband, and be such article* a*

PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION' ARE SURE TO MEET THEIR REWARD. 



the wife, if prudent, would expect, and 
the husband should furnish, if the par- 
ties lived harmoniously together. 

3053. A fugitive from justice, of 
one of the United States to another, 
may be arrested and detained in order 
to his surrender by authority of the 
latter, without a previous demand for 
his surrender by the executive of the 
State whence he fled. 

3654. A watch will not pass under 
bequest of ' wearing apparel,' nor of 

'household furniture and articles for 
family use.' 

3655. Money paid for the purpose of 
settling or compounding a prosecution, 
for a supposed felony, cannot be recov- 
ered back by a party paying it. 

3656. An inkeeper is liable for the 
death of au animal in his possession, 
but may free himself from liability by 
showing that the death was not occa- 
sioned by negligence on his part. 

3657. Notice to the agent of a com- 
pany is notice to the company. 

* 3657. An employer is not liable to 
one of his employees for an injury 
sustained by the latter in consequence 
of the neglect of others of his employ- 
ees engaged in the same general busi- 



ness. 

3658. Where a 
sheriffs sale has bid 
property under the 



purchaser at a 
the full price of 
erroneous belief 



that the sale would divest the property 
of all liens, it is the duty of the court 
to give relief by setting aside the sale. 

3659. When notice of protest is 

Eroperly sent by mail, it may be sent 
y the mail of the day of the dishonor, 
if not, it must be mailed for the mail 
of the next day ;. except that if there 
is none, or it closes at an unseasonably 
early hour, then notice must be mailed 
in season for the i.ext possible mail. 

3660. A powder-house located in a 
populous part of a city, and contain- 
ing large quantities of gunpowder, is 



the seller of goods 



a nuisance. 

36C1. When 

accepts at the time of the sale, the 
note of a third person, unindorsed by 



sumption is that the payment was 
intended to be absolute ; and though 
the note should be dishonored, the pur- 
chaser will not be liable for the value 
of the goods. 

3662. A man charged with crime 
before a committing magistrate, but 
discharged on his own recognizance, is 
not privileged from arrest on civil pro- 
cess while returning from the magis- 
trate's office. 

3663. When one has been induced 
to sell goods by means of false pretences, 
he cannot recover them from one who 
has bonafide purchased and obtained 
possession of them from the fraudu- 
lent vendor. 

3664. If the circumstances at- 
tendant upon a sale and delivery of 
personal property are such as usually 
and naturally accompany such a trans 
action, it cannot be declared a legal 
fraud upon creditors. 

3665. A stamp impressed upon an 
instrument by way of seal, is good as 
a seal, if it creates a durable impres- 
sion in the texture of the paper. 

3666. A witness who has been 
promised a reward for giving his testi- 
mony in case the party calling him 
gained the suit, is incompetent by 
reason of interest. 

3667. If a party bound to make a 
payment use due dilligence to make a 
tender, but through the payee's ab- 
sence from home is unable to find him 
or any agent authorized to take pay- 
ment for him, no forfeiture will be 
incurred through his failure to make a 
tender. 

WASHING FLUIDS. 
(See 2179 and 654.) 

3668. Washing Fluids, in many 
places, have almost universally now 
come into use, resulting in a great 
saving of labor and time, and proving 
far less destructive to wearing apparel 
than the old mode of waging. 

3669. First, select from the clothe* 
to be washed, all the coarse and dirtiest 
pieces from the fine ; then put them in 
sep.irMte tubs of soft water to soak 



the purchaser, in payment, the pre-i over night (the night previous to wash

Ing). Then prepare, in a separate ves- 
sel, the liquid for a large washing, 
namely, half a pound of good brown 
soap, cut in small pieces, half a pound 
of oda, and three ounces of fresh, 
unslacked lime, mixed in one gallon of 
boiling soft water. Stir well up, so as 
to mix the ingredients, and let it stand 
until morning. Then strain off the 
liquid, being careful to leave all sedi- 
ment behind. Having readv ten gal- 
lons or so, of boiling soft water in your 
boiler, pour in the prepared liquid 
(keeping out all settlings that may yet 
be remaining, then throw in your 
clothes and boil them twenty minutes, 
or half an hour. Previous to which, 
put an earthen plate at th y bottom of 
the boiler, to prevent the clothes from 
burning. After boiling the appointed 
time, take tkem out ; scald them, blue 
them, and rinse them in clean, soft 
water, warm or cold, and your clothes 
will be as clean and white as snow. 

By this method, the finest linens, 
Lices, cambrics, etc., can be readily and 
easily cleansed, with VERY LITTLE 
TROUBLE. No rubbing the skin off 
your hands, and tearing the clothes to 
pieces ; and the washing for a family of 
twenty persons completed before break- 
fast ; have the clothes out to dry, the 
house in good order, all comfortable 
again for the day, and the family saved 
from washing-day annoyances. Who 
would not wish to have such comforts? 

Should there be only a small wash- 
Ing, and less than ten gallons of water 
required to boil them in, less of the 
liquid of lime, soap, and soda, can be 
used in proportion. When there is any 
difficulty in procuring fresh lime, a 
quantity of the liquor ^may be made at 
once from the lime, which will keep 
for years, corked in bottles, and ready 
for use. 

The above receipt is called Profes- 
sor Twelvetree's, and is the one mostly 
used in England We have made 
trial of this, and found it to be very 
good. It has one advantage over others 
given. In the use of the lime, which 
possesses et; ng ^ n * chilis 



and will make the clothes bea Jtifully 
white. 

3670. Another Method of Washing, 
occupying exactly One Hour. Have a 
preparation made from two tablespoon- 
fuls of alcohol, two ditto spirits of tur- 
pentine, half a pound of brown soap, 
cut fine and mixed in one quart of hot 
water. Pour the same into a large 
tub of boiling water, and allow the 
clothes to soak for twenty minutes ; 
then take them out and put them in 
a tub of clean cold water for twenty 
minutes. Afterward boil them in a 
like quantity of the above preparation 
for the other twenty minutes, and rinse 
in cold water. 

N. B. In using either of the above 
methods of washing, all fine clothes 
should bo gone through with first ; as 
colored, very dirty, or greasy clothes 
ought not to be boiled with those of 
finer fabric, end containing less dirt, as 
the water in which they are boiled, 
must, of course, partake more or less 
of its contents. The same water that 
has been used for the finer clothes 
will likewise do for coarse and colored. 
Should the wristbands of the shirts 
be very dirty, a little soap may be pre- 
viously rubbed on. 

The above is a very excellent re- 
ceipt, and may be confided in as par- 
ticularly effective in labor saving. 

3671. Another Receipt. Take one 
pint of alcohol, one pint spirits turpen- 
tine, two quarts of strong eoda water. 
Manage the clothes as above directed, 
in No. 2. 

3672. Spirits turpentine, camphene, 
or Porter's burning fluid, separately, 
answer a good purpose. Two or three 
tablespoon fuls to a washing, will greatly 
facilitate the business. 

3673. Another Very Good Receipt. 
One pound hard soap (for four dozen 
clothes), seven teaspoonfuls spirits tur- 
pentine, five ditto hartshorn, five ditto 
of vinegar. 

Directions. Dissolve the soap in hot 

water ; mix the ingredients. Then 

! divide the mixture in two parts ; put 

! half in the water with the clothes ove

night next morning wring them out. 
Put them to boil in five or six gallons 
of water, and add the rest of the mix- 
ture ; boil thirty minutes, and rinse out 
thoroughly in cold water ; blue them, 
and hang 1 out to dry. 

This receipt has been found to an- 
swer a very valuable purpose, and is 
worthy of trial. 

3674. STARCHING, FOLDING, 

IRONING, ETC. 

3675. To Prepare Starch. Take 
two tablespoonfuls of starch dissolved 
in as much water ; add a gill of cold 
water ; then add one pint of boiling 
water, and boil it half an hour, adding 
a small piece of spermaceti, sugar, 
or salt ; strain, etc. Thin it with 
water. 

3676. Flour Starch. Mix flour grad- 
ually with cold water, so that it may be 
free from lumps. Stir in cold water till 
it will pour easily ; then stir it into a pot 
of boiling water, and let it boil five or 
six minutes, stirring it frequently. A 
little spermaceti will make it smoother. 
This starch will answer very well for 
cotton and linen. Poland starch is 
made in the same manner. 

3677. Glue Starch. Boil a piece of 
glue four inches square, in three 
quarts of water. Keep it in a bottle 
well corked. Use for calicoes. 

3678. Gum Starch. Dissolve four 
ounces of gum arable, in a quart of hot 
water, and set it away in a bottle 
corked. This is used for silks and 
fine muslins. It can be mixed with 
water %t discretion. (See 91.) 

3ft79. Starching Clothes. Muslins 
look well when starched, and clapped 
dry, while the starch is hot, then folded 
in a damp cloth, till they become quite 
damp, befoio ironing them. If mus- 
lins are sprinkled, they are apt to be 
spotted. Some ladies clap muslins, 
hen dry them, and afterwards sprinkle 
them. 

3680. Sprinklinif Clothes. They 
ghould be sprinkle^ with clear water, 
and laid in separate piles; one of flan- 
nels, one ( f colored, one o. ' common, 
and one of nVu a tides. 



3681. Folding Clothes. Fold the 
fine articles and roll them in a towel, 
and then fold the rest, turning them 
all right side outward. Lay the color- 
ed articles separate from the rest. 
They should not remain damp long 
as the colors might be iujured. Sheets 
and table linen, should be shaken and 
folded. 

3682. Ironing. In ironing a shirt 
first do the back, then the sleeves, theu 
the collar and bosom, and then the 
front. Iron calicoes generally on the 
right side, as they thus keep clean for 
a longer time. In ironing a frock, first 
do the waist, then the sleeves, then the 
skirt. Keep the skirt rolled while 
ironing- the other parts, and set a chair 
to hold the sleeves while ironing the 
skirt, unless a skirt-board be used. 
Silk should be ironed on the wrong 
side, when quite damp, with an iron 
which is not very hot, light colors are 
apt to change and fade. In ironing 
velvet, turn up the face of the iron, and 
after dampening the wrong side of the 
velvet, draw it over the face of the 
iron, holding it straight ; always iron 
lace and needlework on the wrong 
side, and carry them away as soon as 
they are dry. 

3683. Starching. Clear-starching 
etc. To Make Starch for Linen, Cotton 
etc. To one ounce of the best starch 
add just enough soft cold water to 
make it (by rubbing and stirring) into 
a thick paste, carefully breaking all the 
lumps and particles. When rubbed 
perfectly smooth, add nearly or quite 
a pint of boiling water (with bluing to 
suit the taste), and boil for at least half 
an hour, taking care to have it well 
stirred all the time, to prevent its 
burning. When not stirring, keep it 
covered, to prevent the accumulation 
of dust, etc. Also keep it covered 
when removed from the fire, to prevent 
a scum from rising upon it. To give 
the linen a fine, smooth, glossy appear- 
j ance, and prevent the iron from stick- 
I ing, add a little spermaceti (a piece as 
I large as a nutmeg) to the starch, when 
I boiling, and half a taspoonfnl of tha

finest table-salt. If you have no sperm- 
aceti ("to be had cheap at any druggists), 
take a piece of the purest, whitest hog's 
lard, or tallow (mutton is the best), 
about as large as a nutmeg, or twice 
this quantity of the best refined loaf 
Bugar. and boil with the starch. In 
ironing linen collars, shirt bosoms, etc., 
their appearance will be much im- 
proved, by rubbing them, before iron- 
ing, w'tli a clean white towel, damp- 
ened in soft water. The bosom of a 
shirt should be the last part ironed, as 
this will prevent its being soiled. All 
starch should be strained before 
using. 

3684. To Clear-starch Lace, etc. 
Starch for laces should be thicker and 
used hotter than for linens. After your 
laces have been well washed and dried, 
dip them into the thick hot starch in 
such a way as to have every part pro- 
perly starched. Then wring all the 
starch out of them, and spread them 
out smooth on a piece of linen, and roll 
them up together, and let them remain 
for about half an hour, when they will 
be dry enough to iron. Laces should 
never be clapped between the hands, 
as it injures them. Cambrics do not 
require so thick starch as net or lace. 
Some people prefer cold or raw starch 
for book-muslin, as some of this kind 
of muslin has a thick clammy appear- 
ance, if starched in boiled starch. 
Fin > laces are sometimes wound round 
bottle to dry, which prevents 
i-.i from shrinking. 

oG85. Ironing Laces. Ordinary 
laces and worked muslin can be ironed 
by the usual process with a smoothing 
or sad-iron ; finer laces cannot. When 
the lace has been starched and dried, 
ready for ironing, spread it out as 
smooth as possible on an iron-cloth, and 
pass over it, back and forth, as quickly 
as you can, a smooth, round glass bot- 
tle containing hot water, giving the 
bottle such pressure as may be requir- 
ed to smooth the lace. Sometimes you 
may pass the laces over the bottle, tak- 
ing we to keep them smooth. Eithei 
way is much better than to iron laces 



with an iron. In filling the bottle with 
lot water, care must be taken not to 
pour it in too fast, as the bottle will 
reak. (See 2501.) 

3686. To raise the Pile of Velvet 
alien pressed down. Warm a gmooth- 
ng-iron moderately, and cover it with 

a wet cloth, and lay, or hold it under 
;he velvet, on the* wrong side. The 
steam from this will penetrate the 
elvet, and you can raise the pile with 
, common brush, and make it appear 
as good as new. (See No. 555. ) 

3687. PLANTING BOX FOR 
EDGINGS. The operation of plant- 
';ngBox has ever been considered one, in 
vhich much practice is needed ; that it 
s a labour of time and inconvenience, 

even to the experienced labourer, as 
usually performed, we will not deny ; 
the simple process here recommended 
saves the one and eases the other to an 
extent which only needs to be known 
to be generally practiced. 

3688. The usual mode, after forming 
;he trench and inner edge, is to place 
the strips or tufts of box one by one 
ilorig the length to be planted, securing 
;he same from time to time by press* 
ng the excavated soil against the roots, 
:he tips being regulated to a line stretch- 
ed for the purpose. This involves an 
amount of kneeling and stooping both 
painful and injurious. 

3689. Having provided your box, and 
prepared it in the usual way ready for 
planting, it is simply necessary to have 
a few strips of deal, four, five, or six 
feet long, say half an inch thick by an 
inch wide, or common pantile laths cut 
into lengths will answer the end ; some 
shreds of matting or thin string are also 
required. 

3690. With these inexpensive and 
simple materials you can prepare any 
number of yards in the potting-shed, 
house, or other building, by laying one 
strip of wood on the bench or table, on 
which arrange the prepared box, thin 
or thick, as desired ; then place a sec- 
ond strip of deal on the box, and se- 
cure the two strips together by tying 
at each end ; thus is the be* secured. 



426 



IX OTIIER FOLKS WE FAULTS CAN SPY, 



as it were, between a clamp, and can- 
not fail to be even. 

3691. Flnce these lengths along the 
bed or border, and secure them by 
pressing the soil to the roots with your 
spade or rake, which done, cut the 
ties ; thus are the laths released from 
the box, and lengths in feet planted with 
as much despatch as inches by the ordi- 
nary method, and with an amount of 
regularity and evenness not attainable 
by the usual plan, at the same time 
avoiding the painful, back-aching pro- 
cess of kneeling for hours while plant- 
ing but a few yards. 

3692. DIRECTIONS FOR PRUN- 
ING VINES. In pruning always cut 
upwards, and in a sloping direction. 

3693. Always leave an inch of blank 
wood beyond a terminal bud, and let 

the cut be on the opposite side of the 
bud. 

3694. Prune so as to leave as few 
wounds as possible, and let the surface 
of every cut be perfectly smooth. 

3695. In cutting out an old branch, 
prune it even with the parent limb, that 
the wound may heal quickly. 

3696. Prune so as to obtain the 
quantity of fruit desired on the smallest 
number of shoots possible. 

3697. Never prune in frosty weath- 
er, nor when a frost is expected. 

3698. Never prune in the months of 
March, April, or May ; pruning in either 
of these months causes bleeding, and 
occasions thereby a wasteful and injuri- 
ous expenditure of sap. 

3699. Let the general autumnal prun- 
ing take place as soon after the 1st of 
October as the gathering of the fruit 
will permit. Lastly. Use a priming- 
knife of the best description, and let it 
be, if possible, as sharp as a razor. 

3700. AGE OF A HORSE. Every 
horse has six teeth above and below; 
before three years old he sheds his mid- 
dle teeth ; at three he sheds one more 
on each side of the central teeth ; at 
four he sheds the two corner and last 
of the fore- teeth. 

370 J. r>etweeu four and five the 
florfie cuts the under tusks ; at five will 



cut his upper tusks, at which time hit 
mouth will be complete. 

3702. At six years the grooves and 
hollows begin toiillnpa little; at seven 
the grooves will be well-nigh filled up, 
except the corner teeth, leaving little 
brown spots where the dark brown 
hollows formerly were. 

3703. At eight the whole of the hol- 
lows and grooves are filled up. 

3704. At nine there is very often 
seen a small bill to the outside corner 
teeth : the point of the tusk is worn off, 
and the part tl>at was concave begins to 
fill up and become rounding; the 
squares of tne centra) teeth tegin to 
disappear, und the gums leave them 
small and narrow at the top. 

3705. HOW TO JUDGE A 
HORSE.- -A correspondent, contrary 
to old maxims, undertakes to judge the 
character of a horse by outward ap- 
pearances, and offers the following sug- 
gestions, tke result of his close obsejv 
vation and long experience 5 

3706. If the color be light sorrel, or 
chestnut, his feet, legs, and face white, 
these are marks of kindness 

3707. If he is broad and full between 
the eyes, he may be depended on as a 
horse of good sense, and capable of be- 
ing trained to anything. 

3708 As respects such horses, the 
moro kindly you treat them the better 
you will be treated in return. Nor will 
a, horse of this description stand a whip, 
if well fed. 

3709. If you want a safe horse, avoid 
one that is dish-faced. He may be sc 
far gentle as not to scare ; but he wil\ 
have too much go-ahead in him to be 
sat> with everybody. 

3710. If you want a fool, but a horse 
of great bottom, get a deep bay, witfc 
not a white hair about him. If his face 
is a little dished, so much the worse 
Let no man ride such a horse that is no 1 
an adept in riding they are alwavj 
tricky and unsafe. 

3711. If you want one that will nevei 
give out, never buy a large, 



AND BLAME THE MOTE THAT DIMS THEIR EYE 



427 



3712. A black horse cannot stand 
heat, nor a white one cold. 

3713. If you want a gen tie horse, get 
one with more or less white about the 
head ; the more the better. Many peo- 
ple suppose the parti-colored liorses 
belonging to the circuses, shows, &c , 
five selected for their oddity. But the 
selections th is made are on account of 
their great docility and gentleness. 

3714. WHEN OXEN refuse to work 
equally well on either side, or when 
they pull off against each other, yoke 
them on the side you wish them to 
work, and turn them out to feed in that 
way ; they soon become accustomed to 
it, and work afterward on either side. 

3715. A valuable recipe for curing 
cattle of the fermentation produced in 
their stomachs from eating clover and 
other green food : The remedy is a 
spoonful of ammonia dissolved in a 
glass of water, Dud administered to the 
animal. The cure takes place within 
an hour. (See 3287.; 

3716. Copying Ink : A little sugar 
dissolved in any writing ink will change 
it into a suitable copying- ink. 

3717. THE BEST SEASON FOR 
PAINTING HOUSES. The outside 
of buildings should be painted during 
autumn or winter. Hot weather in- 
jures the paint by drying- in the oil too 
quickly ; then the paint will easily rub 
off. But when the paint is laid on 
during cold weather, it hardens in dry- 
ing, and is firmly set. 

3718. SEEDS. Never retain the 
same kinds of seeds too long upon the 
land ; at the end of three years it will 
generally deteriorate, and ought to be 
changed; change of seed always pro- 
duces a change for the better in the 
crops. Heavy clay-lands will longest 
retain tbe seed pure ; light loams and 
peat soils will sooner require tho 
change. In selecting seed it should bo 
ascertained, if possible, where, and on 
what kind of soil it grew ; and select a 
eoil of different quality to that on which 
't is to be sown. Never select seed 
from a rich soil to sow it on a poor ; 
but prefer that from a poor soil to sow 



it on a rick Always select seed well 
cleaned and pure, being strictly of tbe 
same kind ; seeds of different kinds 
will vegetate at different times, and 
ripen at different seasons, which occa- 
sions serious loss and further deterio- 
ration of sample. 

3719. JOHNNY CAKES. Sift a 
quart of corn meal into a pan; make a 
hole in the middle, and pour in a pint 
of warm water. Mix the meal *nd 
water gradually in a batter, adding a 
teaspoonful of salt ; beat it very quick- 
ly, and for a long time, till it bec< mes 
quite light; then spread it thick and 
even on a stout piece of smooth board ; 
place it upright on the hearth before a 
clear fire, with something to support 
the board behind, and bake it well ; 
cut it into squares, and split and butter 
them hot. They may also be made 
with a quart of milk, three eggs, one 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and 
one teacupful of wheaten flour ; add 
Indian corn-meal sufficient to make a 
batter like that of pancakes, and either 
bake it in buttered pans, or upon a 
griddle, and eat them with butter. 

3720. MANAGEMENT OF A 
WATCH. Wind your watch as nearly 
as possible at the same hour every day. 

3721. P5e careful that your key is in 
good condition, as there is much danger 
of injuring the machine when the key 
is worn or cracked ; there are more 
mainsprings and chains broken through 
a jerk in winding, than from any other 
cause, which injury will sooner or 
later result, if the key be in bad or- 
der. 

3722. As all metals contract by cold 
and expand by heat, it must be manifest, 
that to keep the watch as nearly as pos- 
sible at one temperature, is a necessary 
piece of attention. 

3723. Keep the watch as constantly 
as possible in one position that is, if it 
bangs by day, let it hang by night 
against something soft. 

3724. The hands of a pocket-chro- 
nometer or duplex watch, should never 
be set backwards ; in other watchca 
this is a matter of no consequence. 



428 



EACH LITTLE SPECK AND BLEMISH FIND : 



3725. The glass should never be 
opened in watches that set and regulate 
at the bnck. One or two directions 
viore it is of vital importance that you 
bear in mind. 

"3726. On regulating a watch, should 
it be fast, move the regulator a trifle 
towards the 8low ; and if going slow, do 
the reverse ; you cannot move the reg- 
ulator too slightly or too gently at a 
time, and the only inconvenience that 
can arise is, that you may have to per- 
form the duty more than once. 

3727. On the contrary, if you move 
the regulator too much at a time, you 
will be as far, if not further than ever, 
from attaining your object ; so that you 
may repeat the movement until quite 
tired and disappointed stoutly blaming 
both watch and watchmaker, while the 
fault is entirely your own. 

3728. Again, you cannot be too care- 
ful in respect to the nature and condi- 
tion of your watch-pocket ; see that it 
be made of something soft and pliant 
such as wash-leather, which is the best ; 
and, also, that there be no flue or nap 
that may be torn off when taking the 
watch out of the pocket. 

3729. Cleanliness, too, is as needful 
here as in the key before winding ; for 
if there be dust or dirt in either in- 
stance, it will, you may rely upon it, 
work its way into the watch, as well as 
wear away the engine turning of the 
case. 

3730. OFFENSIVE CESSPOOLS. Sul- 
phate of zinc can be purchased of any 
druggist, in the form of a salt, and a 
pound of it dissolved in two pails of 
warm water and thrown into an offen- 
sive cesspool, will soon deodorize it. 

3w31. ALMOND CUSTARDS. Take 
four ounces of blanched almonds : 4 
yolks of eggs; 1 pint of cream; 2 ta- 
ble-spoonsful of sugar; 2 leaspoonsful 
of rose water. Beat the almonds fine 
with the rose water; beat the yolks 
and sugir together, then add to the 



other ingredients, and stir thorn well to- 
gether until it becomes thick ; then 
pour it into cups. (See 2523. ) 

3732. To DESTROY MITKS IN 
CHEESE, a piece of woolen cloth should 
be dipped in sweet oil, which should be 
well rubbed on the cheese. If one ap- 
plication be not sufficient to destroy 
the mites, the remedy may be used as 
often as they appear. The cheese 
shelves should be washed with soap and 
water. 

3733. FOK CLEANING FLOOR BOARDS. 
Scrubbing them with a mixture 
made by dissolving unslacked lime in 
boiling water will have the desired ef 
feet. The proportions are, two table- 
spoonsful to a quart of water. No 
soap need be used. 

3734. INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR 
DYSENTERY. Take one table spoon- 
ful of common salt, and mix it with two 
tablespoonsful of vinegar and pour 
upon it a half-pint of water, either hot 
or cold (only let it be taken cool.) A 
wine-glass full of this mixture in the 
above proportions, taken every half- 
hour, will be found quite efficacious in 
curing dysentery. If the stomach be 
nauseated, a wine-glass full taken every 
hour will suffice. For a child, the 
quantity should be a teaspoonful of salt 
and one of vinegar in a teacupful of 
water. 

3735. FOR BREAD JELLY, measure 
a quart of boiling water, and set it 
away to get cold. Take one-third of 
an ordinary baker's loaf, slice it, pare 
off the crust, and toast the bread nicely 
to a light brown. Then put it into the 
boiling water, set it on hot coals in a 
covered pan, and boil it gently, till you 
find, by putting some in asppon to cool, 
that the liquid has become a jelly. 
Strain it through a thin cloth, and set 
it away for use. When it is to be 
taken, warm a teacupful, sweeten it 
with sugar, and add a little grated leiu. 
on-peel.

3740. TO MEASURE CORN IN 
THE CRIB. Corn is generally put up 
in cribs made of rails, but the rule will 
apply to a crib of any size or kind. 

Two cubic feet of good, sound, dry 
corn in the ear, will make a bushel of 
shelled corn. To get, then, the quan- 
tity of shelled corn in a crib of corn 
in the ear, measure the length, breadth, 
and height of the crib, inside of the 
rail; multiply the length by the 
breadth, and the product by the height; 
then divide the result by two, and you 
have the number of bushels of shelled 
corn in the crib. 

In measuring the height, of course 
the height of the corn is intended. And 
there will be found to be a difference 
iu measuring corn in this mode, be- 
tween fall and spring, because it shrinks 
very much in the winter and spring, 
and settles down 



3711. ARTIFICERS' WORK- 
How TO MEASURE. (Several differ 
ent Measures are in use by Artificers.) 

3742. CARPENTRY and PLASTER- 
ING are measured by the square foot 
or yard ; or in mouldH or ornamental 
work, by the lineal font. In extensive 
works the square of 100 feet is also 
used. Deductions are made for chiui. 
neys, doors, windows. &c. 

3743. BRICKLAYING is estimated 
by reducing the work to the standard 
thickness of a brick and a half thick, 
and is measured by the running perch 
one foot high, and a brick and a half 
thick. Brickwork is often measured 
by the square yard (9 square feet. ) or 
by the perch, or square rod of 304 
square yards (2724 square feet.) 

2724 = square of 16.} feet 

304 = square of 5g yards. 
And if the wall is more or less than 
a brick and a half thick, it may be re- 
duced to that standard by multiplying 
the number of square rods or yards by 
the number of half bricks in thickness, 
and dividing the product by 3. 

3744. MASONRY is estimated by 
the square and cubic foot the materials 
being measured by their cubic contents, 
and the execution of the work by the 
square foot, including in the measure- 
ment every projection. Thus walls, 
columns, blocks of stone, granite, or 
marble, are measured by the cubic 
foot: and pavements, slabs, chimney- 
pieces, c., by the superficial or square 
foot. In the solid measure, the true 
length, breadth, and thickness are 
taken, and multiplied continually to- 
gether. In the superficial, there must 
be taken the length and breadth of 
every part of the projection, which is 
seen without the general upright face 
of the building. 

3745. PAVING is measured by the 
square yard, and the true area is taken 
for the contents. 

3746. PAINTERS' WORK is coin 
puted in square yards. Every part is 
measured where the color lies, and the 
measuring tape is forced into all the 
mouldings and corners. It is usual K

allow double measure for carved mould- 
ings, &c. 

3747. GLAZIERS take their dimen- 
sions either in feet, inches, aud parts, 
or tenths and hundredths, and they 
compute their work in square feet. In 
taking the length and breadth of a 
window, the cross bars between the 
squares are included. Also, round or 
oval windows are considered rectangles, 
and measured to their greatest length 
and breadth, on account of the waste 
in cutting the glass. 

3748. SLATING and SHINGLING are 
estimated by the square of 100 sqr. feet. 

The average size of slates are as fol- 
lows;

The contents of a roof is found by 
multiplying the length of the ridge by 
the girt over from eaves to eaves allow- 
ing in the girt for the double row of 
elates or shingles at the bottom, or for 
how much one row is laid over another. 
Deductions are made for chimney shafts 
or window holes, If sky-lights are not 
large no allowance is made for them. 

3749. PLUMBERS' WORK is cal- 
culated at so much a pound, or by the 
hundred- weight of 112 Ibs. Sheet lead, 
for roofing, guttering, chimneys, &c., is 
from 6 to 10 Ibs. to the square foot, 
depending on its thickness. Lead pipe, 
1 inch in the bore, is about 14 Ibs.. to 
the linear yard.

dry, weigh a ton. 

3752. DIGGING. 24 cubic feet of

feet of clay, or 13 cubic feet of chalk, 
make 1 ton. 

1 cubic yard of solid gravel or earth 
contains 18 heaped bushels before dig- 
ging, and 1 4 cubic yard, or 27 heapefl 
bushels, or 1 load, when dug.

6 feet make 1 fathom, 120 fathoms 1 
cable length. 

3756. VELOCITY OF SOUND 
AND LIGHT. --Sound moves about 
thirteen miles in a minute. So that if 
we hear a clap of thunder half a minut* 
after the flash, we may calculate that 
the discharge of electricity is ,<i\ .- -1 
a half miles off. 

In one second of time in one beat 
of the pendulum of a clock light trav- 
els over 192,000 miles. Were a can- 
non ball shot toward the sun, and it 
were to maintain fill speed, it would 
be twenty years in reaching it and 
yet light travels through this space ir- 
seven or eight minutes.

The velocity of sound in sea waier is 
4,708 feet per second, at the mean 
temperature of 46.6 Fahrenheit. 

3757. TWIGG'S HAIR DYE- 
An excellent dye, as well as most 
Eerviceable hair-wash. 

Take 1 drachm lac sulphur, 
drachm sugar lead, 4 ounces rose 
water. Mix carefully. Wash the 
hair repeatedly, till it assumes the de- 
sired shade. (See Nos. 270, 1295, 147.) 

3758. PUMPKIN PIE. Take 
out the seeds, and pare the pumpkin or 
squash.; but in taking out the seeds do 
not scrape the inside of the pumpkin ; 
the part nearest the seed is the sweet- 
est ; then stew the pumpkin, and strain 
it through a sieve or cullender. To a 
quart of milk, for a family pie, 3 
eggs are sufficient. Stir in the stewed 
pumpkin with your milk and bcaten- 
up eggs, till it is as thick as you can 
stir round rapidly and easily, if the 
pie is wanted richer make it thinner, 
and add sweet cream or another egg 
or two ; but even 1 egg to a quart of 
milk makes "very decent pies." 
Sweeten with molasses or sugar ; add 
2 tea-spoonsful of salt, 2 table-spoonsful 
of sifted cinnamon, and 1 of powdered 
ginger ; but allspice may be used, or 
any other spice that may be preferred. 
The peel of a lemon grated in gives it 
a pleasant flavor. The more eggs, the 
better the pie. Some put 1 egg to a 
gill of milk. Bake about an hour in 
deep plates, or shallow dishes, without 
an upper crust, in a hot oven. 

3759. COCOANUT PUDDING. 
Break the shell of a middle-sized co- 
coanut so as to leave the nut as whole 
as you can ; grate it with a grater 
after having taken off the brown skin ; 
mix with it 3 oz. of white sugar pow- 
dered, aud about half of the peel of a 
lemon ; mix well together with the 
milk, and put it into a tin lined with 
paste, and bake it not too brown. 

3760. CUSTARD PUDDING. Suf- 
ficiently good for common use, may be 
made by taking 5 eggs beaten up and 
mixed with a quart of milk, sweetened 
with sugar and spiced with cinnamon ; 



allspioe, or nutmeg. It is well to boil 
your nnik first, and let it get cold be- 
fore using it. " Boiling milk enriches 
it so much, that boiled skim milk is 
about as good as new." (We doubt 
this assertion ; at any rate, it can only 
be improved by the evaporation of the 
water .) Bake 15 or 20 minutes. 

3761. PEACH PIE. Take mellow 
juicy peaches wash, slice, and put 
them in a deep pie plate, lined with 
pie crust. Sprinkle a thick layer of 
sugar on each layer of peaches, put in 
about a table-spoonful of water, and 
sprinkle a little flour over the top 
cover it with a thick crust, and bake 
from fifty to sixty minutes. 

3762. RICH MINCE MEAT. Cut 
the root off a neat's tongue, rub the 
tongue well with salt, let it lie 4 days, 
wash it perfectly clean, and boil it till 
it becomes tender ; skin, and when 
cold chop it very finely. Mince as 
small as possible 21bs. of fresh beef 
suet from the sirloin, stone and cut 
small 2 Ibs. of bloom raisins, clean 
nicely 2 Ibs. of currants, pound and sift 
half an ounce of mace, and a quarter 
of an ounce of cloves, grate a large 
nutmeg ; mix all these ingredients 
thoroughly, together with Ik Ibs. of 
good brown sugar. Pack it in jars. 

When it is to be used, allow, for 
the quantity sufficient to make 12 small 
mince pies, 5 finely minced apples, the 
grated rind and juice of a large lemon, 
add a wine-glass and a half of wine ; 
put into each a few bits of citron and 
preserved lemon peol. Three or four 
whole green lemons, preserved in 
brown sugar, and cut into thin slices, 
may be added. (See 3766.) 

3763. RHUBARB PIES. Take th? 
tender stalks of the rhubarb, strip off 
the skin, and cut the stalks into thin 
slices. Line deep plates with pie crust, 
then put in the rhubarb, with a thick 
layer of sugar to each layer of rhu 
barb a little grated lemon peel im- 
proves the pie. Cover the pies with a 
crust; press it down tight ro:md tin? 
edge of the plate, and prick the crusi 
with a fork, ( i that the cruet will noi

burst while baking, and let out the 
juice of the pie. Rhubarb pies should 
be baked about an hour, in a slow oven ; 
it will not do to bake them quick. 
Some cooks stew the rhubarb before 
making it into pies, but it is not so 
good as when used without stewing. 

3764. LEMON PUDDING. Melt six 
ounces of butter, and pour it over the 
same quantity of powdered loaf sugar, 
stirring it well till cold. Then grate 
the rind of a large lemon, and add it 
with 8 eggs well beaten, and the juice 
of two lemons ; stir the whole till it is 
completely mixed together, and bake 
the pudding with a paste round the 
dish. 

3765. COCOANUT CHEESE CAKES. 
Brake carefully the shell of the nut, 
that the liquid it contains may not es- 
cape. Take out the kernel, wash it in 
cold water, pare thinly oif the dark 
skin, and grate the nut on a delicately 
clean bread-grater; put it, with its 
weight of pounded sugar, and its own 
milk, if not sour, or if it be, a couple 
of spoonsful or rather more of water, 
into a silver or block-tin feauce-pan, or 
a very small copper stew-pan perfectly 
tinned, and keep it gently stirred over a 
quite clear fire until it is tender : it will 
sometimes requires au hour's stewing 
to make it so. When a little cooled, 
add to the nut, and beat well with it, 
some eggs properly whisked and 
strained, and the grated rind of 
half a lemon. Line some pattypans 
with fine paste, put in the mixture, and 
bake the cheese cakes from thirteen 
to fifteen mhmtes. 

Grated cocoanut 6 ounces ; sugar 6 
ounces; the milk of the nut, or of 
water, 2 large table-spoonsful : half to 
one hour. Eggs, 5; lemon-rind, half of 
one ; 13 to 15 minutes. 

3766. PLAIN MINCE PIES. Take 
2 Ibs. of lean beef boiled, and 1 Ib. of 
suet, chopped fine ; 3 Ibs. of apples, 
2 Ibs., of raisins or currants, 1 Ib. of 
sugar, a little salt, pepper, cinnamon, 
cloves, and 1 nutmeg; moisten with 
new cider or sweet cream. Make 
a^good paste, and bake about an hour. 



The currants must be wasned and 
dried at the fire; raisins stoned and 
chopped. (See 3762.) 

3767. APPLE PUDDING. Pare and 
core 12 large apples, put them into a 
sauce-pan with water sufficient to cover 
them, stew them till soft, and then 
beat them smooth, and mix in three 
quarters of a pound of pounded loaf 
sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, the juice and grated peel of 
lemons, and the well-beaten yolks of 
8 eggs; line a dish with puff paste, put 
in the pudding and bake it for nearly 
three quarters of an hour ; before serv- 
ing grate loaf sugar over the top till it 
looks white. 

3768. To PICKLE TOMATOES. 
Wash the tomatoes ; puncture them 
slightly with a pointed stick about the 
size of a straw. Then fill a jar with 
alternate layers of tomatoes and salt ; 
let them stand for eight or ten days. 
Then to each gallon of tomatoes add 2 
bottles of powdered mustard ; 4 oz. of 
ground ginger ; 4 oz. of pepper slightly 
bruized ; 1 oz. of cloves ; and 12 onions 
sliced. Put these ingredients in layers 
through the tomatoes. Then cover the 
whole with strong vinegar. 

3769. CREAM PUDDING. Beat up 
the yolks of 4 eggs and 2 whites : add 
a pint of cream, and 2 oz. of clarified 
butter, a spoonful of flour, a little 
grated nutmeg, salt, and sugar ; beat 
till smooth : bake it in buttered cups 
or paste. 

3770. TAPIOCA PUDDING. Soak 
in warm water 1 tea-cupful of tapi- 
oca ; beat 4 eggs with 3 table-spoons- 
ful of sugar ; melt in half a pint of 
milk 1 table- spoonful of butter. Stir 
all together; flavor to your taste, and 
bake in a quick oven. 

377J. FOR DIARRHOEA WHEN 
ACCOMPANIED WITH PAIN. 
Take 2 drachms cone, sulphuric ether, 
2 drachms spirit lavender, comp. \ 
drachm wine opium, 3 drops cil 
cloves. 

One teaspoonful for an adult, on a 
lump of sugar, is the dose. To be 
eaten quickly, and repeated

quarter or half hour, as ftie case re- 
quires. (See 990.) 
:M~-2. FOR DIARRHOEA, WHEN 

ACCOMPANIED BY WATERY DIS- 
CHARGES- Take 4 ounces chalk mix- 
ture, 1 ounce tr. kino, 1 ounce tr. 
catechu, 2 drachms laudanum. 

Dose. One table-spoonful for an 
adult, after every liquid stool. (See 990.) 

3773. AN EXCELLENT HORSE 
LINIMENT. Take 1 pint alcohol, 4 
ounce castile soap, ^ ounce gum cam- 
phor 4 ounce of sal ammoniac. When 
these are dissolved, add 1 ounce of laud- 
anum, 1 ounce origanum, ounce oil 
sassafras, and 2 ounces spirits of harts- 
horn. Bathe freely. Excellent for 
strains, bruises, sprains, windgalls, &c. 

3774. CURIOUS PROPERTIES 
OF SOME FIGURES. To multiply 
by 2 is the same as to multiply by 10 
and divide by 5. 

Any number of figures you may wish 
to multiply by 5, will give the same re- 
sult if divided by 2 a much quicker 
operation than the former; but you 
must remember to annex a cipher to 
the answer where there is no remain- 
der, and where there is a remainder, 
annex a 5 to the answer. Thus, mul- 
tiply 464 by 5, the answer will be 2320 ; 
divide the same number by 2, and you 
have 23*2, and as there is no remainder, 
you add a cipher. Now, take 357, and 
multiply by 5 the answer is 1785. 
On dividing 357 by 2, there iff 178, and a 
remainder; you therefore place 5 at 
the right of the line, and the result is 
again 1785. 

There is something more curious in 
the properties of the number 9. Any 
number multiplied by 9 produces a 
eum of figures which, added together, 
continually makes 9. For example, 
all the first multiples of 9, as 18, 27, 36, 
45, 54, 63, 72, 81, sum up 9 each. 
Each of them multiplied by any num- 
ber whatever produces a similar result ; 
as 8 times 81 are 648, these added to- 
gether make 18, 1 and 8 are 9. Mul- 
tiply 648 by itself, the product is 419,- 
904 -the sum of these digits is 27,2 
and 7 are 9. The rule is invariable 



Take any number whatever and mul 
tiply it by 9 ; or any multiple of 9, and 
the sum will consist of figures which, 
added together, continually number 9. 
As 17 X18 = 306, .6 and 3 are 9; 
1]7 X 27 = 3,159, the figures sum up 
]8. 8 and 1 are 9; 4591 X 72 = 330- 
552, the figures sum up 18, 8 and 1 
are 9. Again, 87,363 X 54 = 4,717,422; 
added together, the product is 27, or 2 
and 7 are 9, and so always. (See 2159.) 

3775. FRAUDULENT SCALES- 
RULE TO DETECT. After an equi- 
librium has been establishedbetween the 
weight and the article weighed, trans- 
pose them, and the weight will pre- 
ponderate if the article weighed is light- 

r than the weight, and contrariwise. 

3776. Rule to ascertain the true weight. 
Let the weight which will produce 
equilibrium after transposition be found, 
and with the former weight be reduced 
to the same denomination of weight: and 
let the two weights thus expressed be 
multiplied together, and the square root 
of the product will be the true weight. 

Example It one weight be 7 Ibs., 
and the other 9 1.7, 7 -f 9 1.7 = 64, 
and the square root of 64 is 8 ; hence 
8 Ibs. is the true weight. 

3777. TRICOPHEROUS FOR 
THE HAIR. Take of pure castor oil 
6 ounces; alcohol (95 per cent), 30 
ounces ; oil bergamot 1 drachm ; oil 
lavender, 1 do. Shake well together. 

This is a very agreeable and most ex- 
cellent preparation for the hair, serving 
to soften it, stimulate its growth, and 
keep it dark and glossy. (See 147.) 

3778. A VERY GOOD MICROS- 
CO PE may be made by dropping a little 
Balsam of Fir, or Canada Balsam, on the 
under side of a thin piece of glass. It 
may be used both before and after it is 
dry. (See 2395. ) 

779. GOOD LIQUID GLUE, for 
household purposes, may be made by 
mixing 3 oz. gum arabic, 3 oz. dis- 
tilled vinegar, with 1 oz white su^ar 
Instead of the distilled vinegar, one 
part ascetic acid and five parts \atei 
may be substituted, (5> 60,63, and

A BOOK OF CONDENSED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE FOE THE MILLION. 



BY THE AUTHOR OF "INQUIRE \VTTHI3y ." 

This is a goodly sized volume of 356 pages, comprising a sort of Encyclo- 
pedia of Scientific Information of all kinds. It is arranged with an Afpha- 
betical Index, in referring to which you can solve almost any problem in 
Natural Philosophy or Learned Science that may come up. It is a book that 
will give you the cream of the information that a long course of practical ex- 
periments and profound study has imparted to the savants and philosophers 
of this progressive age. It contains a collection and solution of 
Thirteen Hundred Thirty-Two Facts In Science & Philosophy, 
some of which, on there first discovery r puzzled the most learned and aptscholars. 

It is useless to go into details of this excellent work. Suffice it to say, 
that it treats on every imaginable subject pertaining to Causes and Effects, 
and must necessarily be invaluable to all persons who desire KNOWLEDGE, 
and whose nu-iui* and position in life have prevented them from acquiring it 
by a regular and tedious course of Study. 

We hesitate not to say, that any one who closely reads this volume will ob- 
tain as much real learning in a few days as years of study and patient research 
would afford them in a regular course. In a word it makes you a learned and 
refined person with spending but very little money, time or trouble. 

No pains have been spared by the Author to make this a popular book, in 
fact a book for the million, and some idea may be formed of its vast usefulness 
when we inform the reader that THE REASON WHY has an 

Index of Contents requiring Forty Columns of Fine Type. 

No person who desires to figure in refined and intelligent circles should delay pur- 
chasing a copy of this capital work, for it will furnish thousands of ideas and im- 
portant topics of conversation, so that the most ignorant person by reading it will 
be posted up on all scientific subjects. 

What Haydn s Dictionary of Dates is in regard to historical events, this wonderful 
book is in respect to scientific facts. The plan of the book and its execution, leave 
nothing to be desired. We can cordially recommend this work to all those inquirers, 
young and old, of both sexes, who are never satisfied until they know the 
" reason why." 

The man who goes out into the world, or attempts to attend properly to his 
domestic duties, will find himself, however abundantly supplied with books or 
bullion, perpetually embarrassed for the want of small facts and small change. 
This volume supplies the 

Ready Coin of Conversation, 

In the shape of SCIENCE FOR THE MILLION , and makes even the negfected in 
early studies feel quite at home upon every topic likely to be discussed within the 
ordinary range of the social circle. It imparts 

Practical Information on the Subject of Practical Facts. 

It may be denominated, Science made easy, or a world of useful every-day learn- 
ing condensed into a volume for your pocket !

THE FAMILY AQUARIUM: 

Or, Aqiia Vivarmm. 

A NEW PLEASURE FOR THE DOMESTIC CIRCLE. 

Being a Familiar and Complete Instructor upon the subject of the Construction, 

Fitting up, Stocking, and Maintenance of the Marine and Fresh 

Water Aquarium, or River and Ocean Gardens. 

By H. 3D. BTJTLB3R, Esq. 

12mo. Cloth, with gilt side stamp. Price 50 Centa. 

We flatter ourselves that we know something of the character and principles 
of the Aquarium, as well as of its management, and we feel capable of doing 
justice to Mr. Butler, who, in this production, has succeeded in arraying even 
the dryest portion of the topic in gay and vivacious, not to say really pleasing 
colors. His style is easy, simple, interesting, full of good nature, and his pages 
abound with salient points of humor, as well as occasionally, flashes of truly 
eloquent thought, and moral commentary. The " Family Aquarium" we do 
not hesitate to pronounce the most perfect work of the kind extant in our 
language. It is not mereiy a rehash of English books having reference to 
English habits and English localities. It is American in all respects, and re- 
markably original, not only teaching the "young idea how to shoot," in pre- 
paring an Aquarium as a substitute for the old fish globe, but showing why the 
water need never be changed, and illustrating the grand compensating princi- 
ple by means of which nature avoids all that redundant waste of exertion. The 
" Family Aquarium," also instructs the reader how and whereto supply himself 
with the most appropriate fish, the most suitable river or sea-plants, insects, 
Crustacea, anemones, or animal flowers, &c., and the best mode of sustaining them

Tlie A.rts of Beauty; 

Or, SECRETS OF A LADY'S TOILET. 

WITH HINTS TO GENTLEMEN ON THE ART OF FASCINATING. 
By MADAM LOLA MONTEZ, 

COUNTESS OP LANDSFBLD. 

Beautifully "bound, in cloth.. 3?rice 5O Cents. 

This wonderful book contains an account, in detail, of all the arts employed 
by the ladies of all the chief cities of Europe for the purpose of developing and 
preserving their charms. Independent of its rare and useful recipes, the 
book is a curiosity as a piece of art itself, for the most delicate subjects are 
handled with a skill and an unexceptional propriety of language that is truly sur- 
prising. The hints to gentlemen on the art of fascinating, form one of the most 
amusing and biting pieces of irony and sarcasm that was ever written. The 
wit of this portion of the book is inimitable, and the " coarser sex," as Lola 
quaintly calls the men, ought universally to bow to her with thanks and admira- 
tion for the work which she has performed.

Modest yet Amusing Curious yet Chaste. 
JTJST ZSSTJE3D! 

One of the most piquant and unique volumes, upon a peculiar, singular, and uni- 
versally interesting subject that has ever found its way into print. A work at once 
MODEST AND AMUSING, CURIOUS, YET CHASTE, on that world-wide and 
thrilling topio LOVE being, as it were, the history, philosophy, character, and 
peculiarities of the passion as illustrated by the

ANECDOTES OF LOVE,

Madame LOLA MONTEZ, Countess of Landsfeldt,

. The subject of Love is one of those which has deeply interested mankind in all 
ages. History overflows, therefore, with the romance and reality of Love, which 
only needs a judicious pen to place them modestly before the mind, to arrest the 
general attention and admiration. That accomplished lady, Madame LOLA MONTEZ, 
with the tact which belongs peculiarly to the feminine nature, especially when im- 
bued with the necessary information and resources, has seized upon this circum- 
stance with the happiest effect in the volume before us. Her acute perception of 
the proprieties of language is here as wonderfully exhibited as her delicate taste in 
selecting those features in the sensation side of love life, which most deserve the 
immortalization of literary embalment. 

These romantic and surpassing anecdotes really contain all of the most tragic 
and comic events connected with the history of the tender passion among all nations 
and in all ages of the world. It is precisely the kind of book which a man will find 
it impossible to relinquish until he has read it through from the first to the last 
chapter. Read the volume and judge for yourself. 

The work is charmingly bound in cloth, price One Dollar, and sent to any ad- 
dress, free of postage. Send cash orders to

This book should be in the hands of every woman, young or old, married or single 
in the United States. Now-a-days, especially, when women are beginning to be so uni 
versally recognized as competent to attend to all sorts of business matters which relat< 
to themselves, such a work is invaluable. It is compiled from the very best and mos 
reliable authorities, and tho legal advice, forms, and information it contains, are for aO, 
the States of the Union. The portions relating to 

RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN IN PROPERTY, THE LAWS OF DIVORCE IN 
ALL THE STATES, LEGAL RIGHTS OF GUARDIANS AND WARDS, ETC., 

Are very full and explicit, and should be understood by every woman who has a dollar's 
worth of property, wno is married or contemplates marriage, or who has children, either 
of her own or by adoption. An able and well-known lawyer, whose forensic attainments 
have given him a reputation hardly excelled in the New or Old Worlds, once said, that 
"more troublesome and expensive litigation arises from the total ignorance of law, 
among women, than from all the malice or chicanery of men !" and his statement is un- 
doubtedly true. A wide circulation of this work will, however, produce a great change 
in this state of things, and its use, as a book of constant reference, will inculcate among 
the women of America, a knowledge of legal science which will not only save them an 
' immense amount of mental anxiety and pecuniary loss, but will enable them to instill 
| into the minds of their children, that comprehension and love of justice, which shali xen- 
| dor them good and law-abiding citizens.

LIVE ANI> LEA RN ; 

A GUIDE FOR ALL WHO WISH TO 

SPEAK AND WRITE CORRECTLY: 

particularly intended as a Book of Reference for the Solution of Difficulties 
connected with Grammar, Composition, Punctuation, &c., with Explanations 
of Latin and French words and Phrases of frequent occurrence in Newspa- 
pers, Reviews, Periodicals, and Books in general containing Examples of 

ONE THOUSAND MISTAKES 

of Daily Occurrence, in Speaking, Writing and Pronunciation. Together 
with Detailed Instructions for Writing for the Press, and forms of Articles 
in the various departments of Newspaper Literature. 216 pages, bound in. 
Cloth, 12mo, price 50 cents, and sent to any address f~cc of postage. 

' Live and Learn" is a most useiul book, designed as a Guide to Gram 
mar, Composition, and Punctuation. So few people speak or write really 
good grammar, and fewer still punctuate decently, that a book that informs 
them how to do so and not ouly that indicates their faults, but shows them 
how they are to be corrected cannot fail to be popular ; there is not a 
person indeed, who might not learn something from it. ^ 

No work heretofore written on this subject contains one half the really 
useful information that the present does. It should be in the hand of every 
man, woman and child in the country, and is alike invaluable to the Scholar, 
the Merchant, the Farmer, and the Artizan. 

There are hundreds of persons engaged in professional and commercial 
pursuits, who are sensible of their deficiencies on many points Connected 
with the grimmar of their own tongue, and who. by self-tuition, are anxious 
to correct such deficiencies, and to acquire the means of speaking and 
writing, if not with elegance at least with a due regard to grammatical ac- 
curacy, to whom this little work is " indispensible." Asa book of refer- 
ence, " Live and Learn" will settle many disputes. It ought to be on every 
table, and be particularly recommended to the young, before habit makes 
common blunders uncommon hard to cure. 

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 

" Live and Learn" is an excellent book. To show our appreciation of its 
merits we have had it cased in leather, and have made a pocket companion 
of it. We look upon it as really indispensible. We advise our readers to 
imitate oar example procure the book and sell it not for any price Edu- 
cational Gazette. 

Such a book as this has long been wanted by those who entertain the 
wish alluded to in the title. It is suitable for ah 1 classes. We have atten- 
tively conned its pages, and can r eeommend it as one of the best works of 
reference for the young student, or even the ripe scholar, and as deserving 
to be generally consumed. The work is altogether useful and indispensible. 
Now York Tribune. 

This book, particularly intended as a work of reference for the solution 
of difficulties connected with grammar, composition and punctuation, etc., 
etc., will be found useful by those who have not received a sound elementa- 
ry 'education and who neverthsless move in position. Daily Times. 

This capital work not only gives examples of over 1000 mistakes, but it 
gives rules for their correction so clear, so terse, and at once so simple that 
tfre most ordinary mind cannot fail to comprehend their meaning. This is 
one of the chief beauties of " Live and Learn," for what is the use of point- 
ing out a grammatical error without giving a key to its correction ? There 
has been several catchpenny works on this subject lately issued. They tell 
the reader that mistakes exist, but give no rule for their avoidance. If you 
want a really good work, buy " Live and Learn."

JUDGE HALIBURTON'S WORKS. 

^ " The writings of Judge Haliburton have long been regarded as the produc- 
tion of the finest humorist that has ever attempted the delineation of Yankee 
character, and these entertaining works before us show that he has lost none 
of his original wit and humor. It will be difficult to find volumes so full of 
fun and good sense as those which chronicle the experience of Sam Slick." 
Commercial Advertiser. 



SAM SLICK'S 
Sayings and Doings. 

Since Sam Slick's first work, he has 
written nothing so fresh, racy, and gen- 
uinely humorous as this. Every line 
of it tells, some way or other instruc- 
tively, satirically, jocosely or wittily. 
Admiration at Sam's mature talents, 
and laughter at his droll yarns, con- 
stantly alternate as with unhalting 
avidity we peruse this last volume of 
his. In every page the Cloekmaker 
proves himself the fastest time-killer a- 
going. We give the titles of some of 
the articles in this capital work : 

The Duke of Kent's Lodge ; Playing 
a Card ; Behind the Scenes ; The Black 
Brother ; The Great Unknown ; Snub- 
bing a Snob ; Patriotism, or, The Two 
Shears ; Too Knowing by Half; Matri- 
mony ; The Wooden Horse ; The Bad 
Shilling ; Trading in Bed ; Knowing the 
Soundings, or, Polly Coffin's Sandhole ; 
An Old Friend with a New Face ; The 
Unburied One ; Definition of a Gentle- 
man ; Looking Up ; The Old Minister ; 
The Barrel Without Hoops ; Facing a 
Woman ; The Attache. 

THE SAYINGS & DOINGS 

Of the Yankee Clockmaker are issued 
in one elegant volume, neatly bound in 
muslin. Price 75 cents ; in Paper, 50 
cents. Sent Free of Postage. Buy it, 
and if you don't laugh, then there is no 
laugh in you. 



SAM SLICK 

IN SEARCH OF A WIFE. 

Everybody has heard of " Sam Slick, 
the Clockmaker," and he has given his 
opinion on almost everything. This 
book c( ntains his opinion about 
COURTIN' THE GALS, 



And his laughable adventures after the 
petticoats. Buy this book if you want 
many good hearty laughs. There is a 
book called " The Horse," and another 
"The Cow," and "The Dog," and so 
on ; why should'nt there be one on 
"The Gals !" They are about the most 
difficult to choose and to manage of any 
created critter, and there ain't any de- 
pendable directions about pickin' and 
choosin' of them. Is it any wonder 
then so many fellows get taken in when 
they go for to swap hearts with them.
