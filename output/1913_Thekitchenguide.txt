GUIDE 



Price 50 Cents 






If miracles thou fain wouldst see, 
Lo, error, death, calamity. 
The leprous stain, the demon flies. 
From beds of pain the sick arise. 



The hungry seas forego their prey, 
The prisoners' cruel chains give way ; 
While palsied limbs and treasures lost 
Both young and old recovered boast. 



And perils perish, plenty's hoard. 
Is heaped on hunger's famished board ; 
Let those relate who know it well, 
Let Padua of her patron tell. 



The hungry seas forego their prey, 
The prisoners' cruel chains give way, 
While palsied limbs and treasures lost, 
Both young and old recovered boast.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

PREPARATION OF FOOD— COOKING. 

The cooking of food has much to do with its nutritive 
value. Many articles which, owing to their mechanical condi- 
tion or other cause, are quite unfit for nourishment when raw, 
are very nutritious when cooked. It is also a matter of com- 
mon experience that a well-cooked food is wholesome and 
appetizing, while the same material, badly cooked, is unpalata- 
ble. There are three chief purposes of cooking. The first is 
to change the mechanical condition so that the digestive juices 
can act upon the food more freely. Heating often changes the 
structure of food materials very materially, so that they are 
more easily chewed and more easily and thoroughly digested. 
The second is to make it more appetizing by improving the 
appearance or flavor, or both. Food which is attractive to 
the taste quickens the flow of saliva and other digestive juices, 
and thus digestion is aided. The third is to kill, by heat, any 
disease germs, parasites or other dangerous organisms it may 
contain. This often is a very important matter, and applies 
to both animal and vegetable foods. 

The cooking of meats develops the pleasing taste and odor 
of extractives and that due to the browned fat and tissues and 
softens and loosens the protein of the connective tissues, and 
thus makes the meat more tender. Extreme heat, however, 
tends to coagulate and harden the albuminoids of the lean por- 
tions, and also weakens the flavor of extractives. If the heat- 
ing is carried too far a burned or charred product of bad flavor 
results. 

Meats lose weight in cooking. A small part of this is due 
to escape of meat juices and fat, but the chief part of the ma- 

26 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

terial lost is simply water. The nutritive value of a meat 
soup depends upon the substances which are dissolved out of 
the meat and gristle by the water. In ordinary meat broth 
these consist almost wholly of extractives and salts, which are 
very agreeable and often most useful as stimulants, but have 
little or no value as actual nutriment, since they neither build 
tissue nor yield energy. The principles which underlie the 
cooking of fish are essentially the same as with meats. 

In many vegetables the valuable carbohydrates, chiefly 
microscopic starch grains, are contained in tiny cells with thick 
walls on which the digestive juices have little effect. The heat 
of cooking, especially with the aid of water, ruptures these 
walls and also makes the starch more soluble. The heat also 
caramelizes a portion of the carbohydrates and produces agree- 
able flavors in this and other ways. 

In breads, cakes, pastry and other foods prepared from 
flour, the aim is to make a palatable and lighter porous sub- 
stance more easily broken up in the alimentary canal than th6 
raw materials could be. Sometimes this is accomplished simply 
by means of water and heat. The heat changes part of the 
water in the dough into steam, which, in trying to escape, 
forces the particles of dough apart. The protein (gluten) of 
the flour stiffens about the tiny bubbles thus formed and the 
mass remains porous even after the steam has escaped. More 
often, however, other things are used to "raise" the dough — 
such as yeast and baking powder. The baking powder gives 
off the gas carbon dioxide and the yeast causes fermentation 

in the dough by which carbon dioxide is produced. This acts 
as the steam does, only more powerfully. 

Scrupulous neatness should always be observed in keep-

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

ing, handling and serving food. If ever cleanliness is desira- 
ble, it must be in the things v/e eat, and every care should be 
taken to insure it for the sake of health as v^ell as of decency. 
Cleanliness in this connection means not only absence of visible 
dirt, but freedom from undesirable bacteria and other minute 
organisms and from v^orms and parasites. 

If food, raw or cooked, is kept in dirty places, peddled 
from dirty carts, prepared in dirty rooms and in dirty dishes, 
or exposed to foul air, disease germs and other offensive and 
dangerous substances can easily get in. 

Food and drink may, in fact, be very dangerous purveyors 
of disease. The bacteria of typhoid fever sometimes find their 
way into drinking water, and those of typhoid and scarlet 
fevers and diphtheria into milk, and bring sickness and death 
to a large number of people. Oysters which are taken from 
the salt water where they grow and "floated" for a short time 
in brackish water near the mouth of a stream, have been known 
to be infected by typhoid fever germs brought into the stream 
by the sewage from the houses where the dejections from pa- 
tients had been thrown into the drains. Celery or lettuce 
grown in soil containing typhoid germs has been thought to 
convey this disease. 

Food materials may also contain parasites, like tape- 
worms, in beef, pork and mutton, and trichineae in pork, which 
are often injurious and sometimes deadly in their effect. This 
danger is not confined to animal foods. Vegetables and fruits 
may become contaminated with eggs of numerous parasites 
from the fertilizers applied to them. Raw fruits and vege- 

28 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

tables should always be thoroughly washed before serving if 
there is any doubt as to their cleanliness. If the food is suf- 
ficiently heated in cooking, all organisms are killed. 

Sometimes food undergoes decomposition in which in- 
jurious chemical compounds, so-called ptomaines, are formed. 
Poisoning by cheese, ice cream, preserved fish, canned meats, 
and the like, has been caused in this way. The ptomaines often 
withstand the heat of cooking. 

In some cases it has been found that foods are adulterated 
with compounds injurious to health, but in which harmless 
articles of inferior cost or quality are added is more common. 

Dainty ways of serving food have a usefulness beyond 
their aesthetic value. Everyone knows that a feeble appetite 
is often tempted by a tastefully garnished dish, when the ma- 
terial, carelessly served, would seem quite unpalatable. Fur- 
thermore, many cheap articles and left-overs, when well-sea- 
soned and attractively served, may be just as appetizing a3 
dearer ones, and will usually be found quite as nutritious.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

BEEF BROTH. 

1 pound lean beef, 1 pint cold water. 

Chop the meat very fine and soak it in the cold water 1 
hour or longer; put it in a saucepan surrounded by lukewarm 
water and cook until it has become a reddish brown, stirring 
all the time. (A small rack should be placed under the sauce- 
pan.) Remove from the fire, strain through a coarse strainer 
and season. 

BEEF STOCK. 

2 pounds meat and bone, 2 quarts cold water. 

Cut the meat into small pieces, crack the bone and soak 
1 hour in cold water; then cook at a low temperature for 3 
hours. Strain through a cloth. The trimmings and bones 
of fresh meats or bones or pieces from roasts may be cut into 
small pieces and used for stock, but no smoked or charred 
pieces of meat or bone should be used. Stock may be colored 
with caramel. 

SCOTCH BROTH. 

3 pounds neck of mutton, 3 quarts of water, V^ cup pearl 
barley or rice, l^ cup of carrot, i/4 cup of turnip, i/4 cup of 
celery, 14 teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon chopped onion, 1 
tablespoon of butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, 
1 tablespoon chopped parsley. 

Remove the fat and bone and cut the meat into 1-inch 
pieces. Soak in 2 quarts of cold water 1 hour, then bring 
quickly to boiling point and skim. Drain the barley, which has 
been soaked in cold water over night, and add this to the broth. 
Cook for 2 hours at a low temperature. While the meat is 
soaking soak the bones in the other quart of water 1 hour, 
then heat slowly and boil 2 hours, skim, strain and add liquid 
to the broth. Add the vegetables and cook until they are soft. 
Thicken with butter and flour cooked together, add seasoning, 
and the chopped parsley just before serving. 

30 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

PEPPER POT. 

Put 2 pounds of tripe into the soup pot and cover it with 
cold water, and boil until it is tender. Then, take out the tripe, 
skim and stir the liquid, cut the tripe into small pieces, and put 
back into the liquid. If there is not enough of this add boiling 
water. Flavor with % teaspoon of sweet marjoram, sweet 
basil and thyme, 2 sliced onions, sliced potatoes, salt and 
pepper. When these have boiled until almost tender, add a 
piece of butter rolled in flour, drop in some egg balls, boil 15 
minutes more. Serve hot. 

VEGETABLE SOUP

You can make bean soup the same way, but use 1 table- 
spoon of beans. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

To 1 quart of beef broth use the tips of 1 bunch of aspara- 
gus. It is prepared like rice soup. 

31 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

SOUPS WITHOUT MEAT. 
GENERAL RULES. 

These soups are thickened by using butter and flour; this 
prevents a separation of the thicker and thinner parts of the 
soup; the butter should be heated until it bubbles, the flour 
and seasoning added and enough of the hot liquid to make a 
smooth sauce, thin enough to pour easily ; this should be poured 
into the rest of the hot liquid and cooked in a double boiler 
until the soup is the proper consistency. 

These soups must be served as soon as cooked, and in hot 
dishes. 

POTATO SOUP. 

3 potatoes, 1 pint of milk or 1 pint of milk and water, 2 
teaspoons of chopped onion, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 table- 
spoon of flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, Vs of a teaspoon of white 
pepper, 2 teaspoons of parsley, celery salt. 

Cook the potatoes until soft, drain; cook the milk and 
onion in a double boiler. Beat potatoes with a wire potato 
masher, add the hot liquid, strain and return to the boiler; 
make a white sauce, using this as liquid. Cook 5 minutes and 
add the chopped parsley just before serving. 

BEAN SOUP. 
Take 1 cup of beans, soak several hours or over night; 
put to boil in 1 quart cold water. Slice half an onion, and fry 
in a tablespoon of butter. Add it to the beans, and simmer 4 
or 5 hours, or until the beans are soft, adding cold water so 
as to keep the quantity 1 quart. Cook together 1 tablespoon 
each flour and butter, and add to the soup. Season with a 
tablespoon salt and a sprinkle of pepper and mustard. 

32

Cook the celery in the boiling water until very soft ; strain 
and add the hot liquid; make a white sauce and cook until it 
is like thick cream. 

FISH. 

Fish must be perfectly fresh and should be kept in a cold 
place until cooked. Do not put in refrigerator on account of 
odor. The flesh should be firm and the eyes bright. 

The inside and outside of the fish should be thoroughly 
cleansed with a cloth wet with salt water. The head and tail 
may be removed. Dry fish need butter rubbed over them 
before broiling. 

When fish is cooked the flesh separates from the bone. It 
should be served hot, with a sauce or garnished with lemon, 
iiard-cooked eggs or parsley. 

Cold, cooked fish may be used in various ways, as creamed, 
scalloped, etc. 

BROILED FISH.

88 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

1 pint, or 30 oysters, 3 cups of bread crumbs, i^ teaspoon 
of salt, cayenne, 3 tablespoons of butter, l^ cup of oyster juice. 

Prepare the oysters by pouring cold water over them in 
a colander; remove pieces of shell. Strain the juice through 
a cloth. 

The crumbs used are prepared from the inside of stale 

bread. The crumbs must be seasoned and added to the melted 
butter. Place the material in layers, first the bread crumbs, 

then the oysters, then bread crumbs, then oysters again and 

the top layer bread crumbs; add the oyster juice, and bake in 

a moderate oven 30 to 40 minutes. If baked in shells 4 cups 

of buttered crumbs must be used, and the oysters cut into small 

pieces. Only 15 minutes will be required for baking in shells. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Boil 25 oysters in their own juice for one minute, stirring 
steadily. Drain, put back the liquor on the fire ; add 1 cup of 
milk; rub a tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour to

2 tablespoons of butter, % teaspoon of white pepper, 1 
teaspoon of salt, cayenne, 1 pint or 30 oysters. 

Place all the ingredients, except the oysters, in a chafing: 
dish or a covered saucepan. When hot, add the oysters, cover 
and shake the pan occasionally. When the oysters are plump, 
drain them and place them where they will keep hot. 

Add enough cream to the liquid in the pan to make 1 cup- 
Sauce. 

2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of flour, salt and 
pepper, 1 cup of cream and oyster liquid, 1 teaspoon lemon 
juice, 1 egg. 

Cook ingredients, except egg and lemon juice, as a white 
sauce. Beat the egg until light, and pour the hot sauce gradu- 
ally over it. Add the oysters and lemon juice and, when hot, 
serve on toast or in patty dishes. 

OYSTER STEW. 

1 CUD of milk, 1 pint or 30 oysters, salt and pepper, 1 table- 
spoon of butter.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



CLAM STEW. 

Drain the liquor from 15 clams, heat the liquor in a porce- 
lain saucepan, add 1 tablespoon of flour stirred into 4 table- 
spoons of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 pint of cream or milk; 
let all come to a boil ; then, add the clams ; if very large, cut in 
two. If the clams are in the shell, place them on a gridiron 
over the hot coals, taking them out of the shell soon as open, 
saving the juice. 

DEVILED CRABS. 

To the meat of 1 dozen of hard-shelled crabs add pepper, 
salt, dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Heat 2 
cups of fresh milk, add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of 
bread cr»mbs and some chopped parsley. Stir and cook a few 
minutes. Remove from fire and mix with the picked crab 
meat. Fill each shell, cover witk cracker crumbs, with a bit 
of butter on top. Bake in oven until brown. 

LOBSTER CUTLETS. 

In making them, meat of a lobster weighing 21/2 pounds, 
cut into small dice and seasoned with salt and pepper; then, 3 
heaping teaspoons of flour, added to 3 tablespoons of butter, 
which has been heated. When the butter and flour are smooth, 
add a half cup of cream, 1 well-beaten egg and salt and pepper 
mixed with it. When this boils up once, the mixture taken 
from the fire, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice added. The 
mixture is then poured upon a flat dish and set away to cool. 
When cold, a tin cutlet mould is buttered and sprinkled with 
bread crumbs. The cold mixture is pressed into the mould 
■and then turned out. This continue until all the cutlet mix- 

41 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

ture is used. The mould only buttered once, being well 
crumbed each time. The cutlets are now dipped into beaten 
egg and then in bread crumbs and placed in a frying basket 
and plunged into boiling fat for about 2 minutes. Part of a 
small claw in each one to represent the bone in a cutlet. 

Make croquettes out of the same mixture, only shape into 
croquettes. 

GENERAL RULES FOR MEAT. 

Meat must be weighed, trimmed and wiped with a damp 
cloth. 

Meat should be removed from the paper in which it was 
wrapped and kept in a cool place. 

Only tender cuts of meat should be broiled, pan-broiled or 
roasted. When meat is to be cooked by any of these methods, 
it is first seared; then, the temperature slightly lowered; by 
searing the albumin on the outside of the meat is hardened 
and the meat is cooked in its own juices. 

Tough meat should be cooked in water; boiling water 
hardens the albumin on the outside of the meat and keeps in 
the juices. Meat should be put in boiUng water and the water 
allowed to boil for ten or 15 minutes; then, cooked at a low 
temperature until tender. If the water bubbles it is too hot. 
All tough meat may become tender if cooked in this way. The 
time for roasting or cooking meat in water varies with the 
weight and quality. 

Time for broiling meat varies with the thickness of the 

Stock and broth are prepared by long soaking in cold

water and cooking at a low temperature for several hours. 
Then, cool uncovered. 

The meat which remains after straining may be used in 
any place where cooked meat is used, with the addition of a 
little fresh meat to give it flavor. 

The fat must not be removed from stock or broth, as it 
excludes the air and prevents decomposition. It must be en- 
tirely removed before using stock or broth, and may be used 
in place of drippings. The trimmings of fat meat should be 
clarified. 

Small globules of fat may be removed from cold broth 
with a cloth which has been dipped in boiling water, then 
wrung dry. Fat may be removed from hot broth by using 
tissue paper or a piece of bread. 

COOKING OF TENDER MEAT. 
ROASTING. 

Skewer meat into shape. Lay it on a rack in a meat pan 
and place pieces of fat from meat in the bottom of the pan. 
Place it in a hot oven on the grate for 10 minutes to sear the 
meat. It may be seasoned with salt and pepper if desired. 
Remove to the floor oven and baste every 10 minutes until done. 

BROILING. 

Remove extra fat from the meat. Grease the broiler with 
some of the fat. Broil over a clear fire; sear and then turn 
every 10 seconds. Chops 1 inch thick should be cooked 5 min- 
utes. A steak 2 inches thick should be cooked 10 minutes. 
Season and serve on a hot platter.

PAN-BROILING. 

Remove all the fate from the meat. Heat a frying pan 
very hot, without any fat. Sear all the meat on both sides; 
then, cook more slowly until done. Stand chops up on edge 
to brown. Keep the pan free from fat. The time for pan- 
broiling is the same as for broiling. 

POT ROAST.

the vein or the round. Wipe with a clean, wet cloth. Sear 
all over by placing in a hot frying pan and turning till all the 
surface is browned. Put in a kettle with one cup of water 
and place it where it will keep just below the boiling points 
Do not let the water boil entirely away, but add only enough 
to keep the meat from burning. Have cover fitting closely to 
keep in the steam. Cook until very tender, but do not let it 
break. Serve hot or cold. The meat, when cold is delicious^, 
cut in quarter-inch slices and sauted in hot butter. 
HAMBURGER STEAK.

Cut off the shank bone, trim the knuckle and wash and wipe 
it very clean; plunge it into sufficient boiling water to cover 
it; let it boil up; then, draw the sauce-pan to the side of the 
fire, where it should remain till the finger can be borne in the

water. Then, place it sufficiently near the fire, that the water 
may gently simmer, and be very careful that it does not boil 
fast, or the meat will be hard. Skim well, add a little salt, and 
in about 214 hours after the water begins to simmer, a mod- 
erate-sized leg of mutton will be done. Serve with carrots and 
mashed turnips, which may be boiled with the meat, and send 
caper sauce to the table with it in a tureen.

powder. Add the flour, stir until smooth and brown. Add 
the stock and the meat, and when the sauce has sufficiently 
thickened, season and serve. 1 cupful of meat and 1 of vege- 
tables may be used, lima beans or peas giving the best flavor. 

ROAST SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 
Remove the bone and fill the space with a moist stuffing 
made of bread crumbs, stale bread, highly seasoned with but- 
ter, salt, pepper and thyme. Add the yolk of 1 or 2 eggs and 
enough warm water to soften the bread thoroughly. Put the 
bones and scraps of meat in a kettle with barely water enough 
to cover, lay the stuffed shoulder on them and let the whole 
simmer gently for an hour or more to make it tender. Lift 
on to the rack in a roasting pan, dredge with salt, pepper and 
flour and bake an hour or till tender. Use the water in the 
kettle for basting and for gravy, with a little butter and flour 
at the last to froth the surface. Garnish with forcemeat balls

great addition to all kinds of stews and ragouts. 

55 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

LAMB CHOPS. 

Lamb chops are very delicate and tender. Trim off the 
skin and the greater part of the fat. Lay the meat in a wire 
broiler and proceed as in broiling steak. A lamb chop 1 inch 
thick requires from 7 to 10 minutes cooking. They should 
never be served rare. 

LAMB STEW. 

Cut the lamb into small squares, first removing the fat. 
Then, put on in stew-pan, covering with water, and let heat 
slowly. When partly done add a little sliced pork (salt), 1 
or 2 sliced onions, pepper and salt, and 2 or 3 cut up potatoes. 
Cover and continue to stew till the meat is tender. Then, drop 
in a few small dumplings, stew 15 minutes more and serve. 
The gravy should be thickened with a little flour moistened 
with milk. 

SWEETBREADS. 
TO CLEAN SWEETBREADS. 

Carefully pull off all the tough and fibrous skin. Place 
them in a dish of cold water for 10 minutes or more, and they 
are then ready to be boiled. They must always be boiled in 
slightly salted water with a little lemon juice 20 minutes, no 
matter what the mode of cooking is to be. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

Soak sweetbreads in salt and water an hour or more to 

draw out the blood. Prepare a-ccording to the directioHs given 
— roll in salted corn meal, fry in hot lard, using enough to 
cover the bottom of frying pan, cook thoroughly; do not par- 
boil. 

56 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

BROILED SWEETBREADS. 

Rub well with butter and cook on a clean gridiron. Turn 
frequently, occasionally rolling on a plate with some hot melted 
butter. This keeps them from getting dry and hard. 
STEWED SWEETBREADS. 

Remove all skin and fat, cover with cold water, and bring 
to a boil. Pour off the hot water, and cover with cold water 
until they are firm. Stew a second time with very little water. 
When tender, add a teaspoonful of butter to each sweetbread, 
with pepper, salt, chopped parsley and a little cream. Simmer 
for 5 minutes, and serve in covered dish, with the gravy 
poured in. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

To fry sweetbreads, wash carefully and rub dry, lard with 
narrow strips of fat pork, and lay in a hot frying pan, well 
greased, and cook to a fine brown. Turn frequently till the 
pork is crisp. 

VEAL. 
ROAST VEAL. 

Rinse the meat in cold water; if any part is bloody, wash 
it off ; make a mixture of pepper and salt, allowing a large tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper for each pound 
of meat ; wipe the meat dry ; then, rub the seasoning into every 
part, shape it neatly, and fasten it with skewers, and put it 
on a spit, or set it on a trivet or muffin rings in a pan; stick 
bits of butter over the whole surface; dredge a little flour

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

over, put a pint of water in the pan to baste with, and roast it 
before the fire in a Dutch oven or reflector, or put it in a hot 
oven ; baste it occasionally, turn it if necessary that every part 
may be done ; if the water wastes add more, that the gravy may 
not burn; allow 15 minutes for each pound of meat; a piece 
weighing 4 pounds will require 1 hour. 

VEAL CHOPS. 

Cut veal chops about an inch thick; heat them flat with 

a rolling pin, put them in a pan, pour boiling water over them, 

and set them over the fire 5 minutes; then, take them up and 

wipe them dry ; mix a tablespoonf ul of salt and a teaspoonf ul 

of pepper for each pound of meat; rub each chop over with 

this; then, dip them, first into beaten egg, then into rolled 

done, over a bright, clear fire of coals; then, take them on to 

in hot lard or beef drippings, or broil them. For the broil have 

some sweet butter on a steak dish; broil the chops until well 

done, over a bright, clear fire of cials; then, take them on to 

the butter; turn them carefully once or twice in it and serve. 

Or dip the chops in a batter made of 1 egg, beaten, with half 
a teacup of milk and as much wheat flour as may be necessary. 
Or simply dip the chops without parboiling into wheat flour; 
make some lard or beef fat hot in a frying pan ; lay the chops 
in, and when one side is brown, turn the other. When they 
are done take them up, put a little into the pan, then put in 
the dish with the chops. 

Or make a flour gravy thus: After frying them as last 
directed, add a teaspoonful of fat to that in the pan, let it come 
to a boiling point ; make a thin batter of a small teaspoonful of 
wheat flour and cold water; add a little more salt and pepper 
to the gravy ; then, gradually stir in the batter ; stir it until it 
is cooked and a nice brown ; then, put it over the meat, or in the 
dish with it; if it is thicker than is liked, add a little boiling 
water.

Boil a calf's head in water enough to cover it, until the 
meat leaves the bones; then, take it, with a skimmer, into a 
wooden bowl or tray ; take from it every particle of bone ; chop 
it small, season with pepper and salt; a heaping tablespoon 
salt and a teaspoon of pepper will be sufficient; if liked, add a 
tablespoonful of finely chopped sweet herbs; lay a cloth in a 
colander, put the minced meat into it; then, fold the cloth

Two or 3 pounds of veal cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, 2 
tablespoonfuls of minced savory herbs, salt and pepper to 
taste, a little grated nutmeg. 

Cut the cutlets about three-quarters of an inch in thick- 
ness, flatten them and brush them over with the yolk of an 
egg; dip them into bread crumbs and minced herbs, season 
with pepper and salt and grated nutmeg and fold each cutlet 
in a piece of buttered paper. Broil them and send them to 
the table with melted butter or a good gravy.

CALF'S LIVER AND BACON. 

Two or 3 pounds of liver, bacon, pepper and salt to taste, 
a small piece .of butter, flour, 2 tablespoonf uls of lemon juice, 
14-pint of water. 

Cut the liver in thin slices and cut as many slices of bacon 
as there are of liver; fry the bacon first; then, put that on a 
hot dish before the fire. Fry the liver in the fat which comes 
from the bacon, after seasoning it with pepper and salt and 
dredging over it a little flour. Turn the liver occasionally to 
prevent its burning, and when done lay it around the dish, with 
a piece between each. Pour away the bacon fat, put in a small 
piece of butter, dredge in a little flour, add the lemon juice and 
water, give one boil, and pour it in the middle of the dish. 

DRY HASH. 

One quart potatoes, cut in quarters, and boil in beef stock. 
1 pint of meat, chopped coarsely; season with salt, pepper, 
thyme and onion. When the potatoes are cooked drain off the 
stock and mash the potatoes and meat together. Thicken stock 
with cornstarch and pour over the hash. 

VEAL CUTLETS 2. 

Sprinkle the cutlets with salt and pepper, dip in beaten 
egg, roll in cracker crumbs, and fry in hot lard or dripping. A 
little boiling water may be added to the gravy when the meat 
is dished and a thickening of brown flour.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

CURING MEATS. 

Meat must be properly and thoroughly cooled to insure 
good keeping qualities when cured. If salted before the animal 
is out, the shrinkage of the muscles causes the retention of 
injurious gases, giving an offensive odor to the meat. Neither 
should be frozen when salted, as the action of the frost will 
prevent the proper penetration of the salt and uneven curing 
will result. It is important, also, that curing should begin 
as soon as the meat is cooled and while it is still fresh. Tainted 
meat may be cured so that it will keep, but nothing in the line 
of preservatives can bring back the natural flavor when it is 
once lost. The safest rule to follow is to salt meat as soon 
as the animal heat is out, and before it freezes or starts to 
decay. Ordinarily, 24 hours to 36 hours after slaughtering 
will allow sufficient time for cooling. 

VESSELS FOR CURING. 

A clean, hardwood barrel is a suitable vessel in which to 
cure meat. A barrel made for the purpose is best, but where 
it cannot be had a molasses or syrup barrel will answer. 

A kerosene barrel that has been burned out and used for 

a water barrel for some time is often used for a meat barrel. 

The important point is to have it clean and tight enough to 

prevent leakage. A large stone jar is the best vessel that can 

be had. The jar is more easily cleaned than a barrel, and is in 

every way preferable if the first cost can be afforded. A barrel 

or jar that has once held meat may be used again and again, 
unless meat has spoiled in it. If used repeatedly it will be 
necessary to scald it out thoroughly each time before packing 
with fresh meat.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

PRESERVATIVES. 

Salt and sugar or molasses are the best preservatives most 
commonly used, and are considered the only necessary for per- 
fect curing and the finest quality of cured meats. The proprie- 
tary preparations put on the market are dangerous to the 
health. They are more active than salt, and the chief reason 
for their use is to hasten the curing process. 

Salt is an astringent, and when applied alone to meat ren- 
ders it very hard and dry. Its action is first to draw out the 
meat juices. In a few days it will contract and harden the 
muscle fibres, thus shrinking the volume of meat. Saltpeter 
is used to preserve the natural color of the flesh, or to give a 
reddish color, but it is harmful to the health. It is even more 
astringent than salt. Sugar is not an astringent and its pres- 
ence in the pickle softens the muscle fibres and improves the 
flavor of the meat. Saleratus (baking soda) is used in small 
quantities to sweeten the brine. In warm weather a small 
quantity vv?^ill aid in preventing the brine from spoiling. 

RECIPES FOR CURING. 
PLAIN SALT PORK. 

Rub each piece of meat with fine common salt and pack 
closely in a barrel. Let stand over night. The next day 
weigh out 10 pounds of salt and 2 ounces of saltpeter to each 
100 pounds of meat and dissolve in 4 gallons of boiling water. 
Pour this brine over the meat and dissolve in 4 gallons of boil- 
Pour this brine over the meat when cold, cover and 
weight down to keep it under the brine. Meat will pack 
best if cut into pieces about 6 inches square. The pork should 

be kept in the brine till used. 

63 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

SUGAR-CURED HAMS AND BACON. 

When the meat is cooled, rub each piece with salt and allow 
it to drain over night. Then, pack it in a barrel with the hams 
and shoulders in the bottom, using strips of bacon to fill in be- 
tween or to put on top. Weigh out for each 100 pounds of meat 
8 pounds of salt, 2 pounds of brown sugar and 2 ounces of 
saltpeter. Dissolve all in 4 gallons of water and cover the meat 
with the brine. For summer use it will be safest to boil the 
brine before using. In that case it should be thoroughly 
cooled before using. For winter curing it is not necessary 
to boil the brine. Bacon strips should remain in this brine 4 
to 6 weeks ; hams, 6 to 8 weeks. This is a standard recipe and 
has given the best of satisfaction. Hams and bacon cured in 
the spring will keep right through the summer after they are 
smoked. The meat will be sweet and palatable if it is properly 
smoked, and the flavor good. 

DRY-CURED PORK. 

For each 100 pounds of meat weigh out 5 pounds of salt, 
2 pounds of granulated sugar, 2 ounces of saltpeter, and mix 
them thoroughly. Rub the meat once every 3 days with a 
third of the mixture. While the meat is curing it is best to 
have it packed in a barrel or tight box. For the sake of con- 
venience it is advisable to have 2 barrels, and to transfer the 
meat from one to the other each time it is rubbed. After the 
last rubbing the meat should lie in the barrel for a week or ten 
days, when it will be cured and ready to smoke. To cure nicely 
it is desirable to have a cool and rather moist place in which 
to keep it. This recipe should not be used where the meat 
must be kept in a warm and dry place, as the preservatives 
will not penetrate easily and uniformly.

PICKLED PIG'S FEET. 

Soak the pig's feet for twelve hours in cold water. Scrape 
them clean and remove the toes. Boil until soft ; 4 or 5 hours 
will usually be required. Salt them when partially done. Pack 
them in a stone jar and cover them with hot, spiced vinegar. 
They are served cold, or split and fried in a batter made of 
eggs, flour, milk and butter. 

PORK. 
ROAST PIG. 

Lay a nicely-dressed pig in a tub of cold water all night ; 
in the morning change the water, and let it remain until it is 
time to roast it; then, wipe it dry, rub the inside well with 
sage, cayenne and salt mixed, and stuff it with a dressing made 
of bread crumbs, salt pork chopped fine, pepper, salt, sweet 
margerum, and an egg. It should be roasted on a spit before 
the fire; but, lacking convenience for this mode, the pig must 
be placed (the feet turned under) on a rack in the dripping 
pan with some water, in which are some sprigs of sage and 
margerum tied in muslin. Keep it well floured until half done ; 
then, take out, wipe off the flour, return it to the oven and 
baste well with butter, repeating this several times until the 
pig is roased. Serve on a large platter with a potato or a 
small ear of unhusked green com in its mouth. The herbs 
may be taken from the dripping pan, the gravy thickened with 
flour and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Then, serve 
in a boat. Allow 3 hours for roasting. 

HEAD CHEESE. 

Cut a hog's head into 4 pieces. Remove the brain, ears, 
skin, snout and eyes. Cut off the fattest parts for lard. Put 
the lean and bony parts to soak over night in cold water in 
order to extract the blood and dirt. When the head is cleaned 
put it over the fire to boil, using water enough to cover it. Boil 
until the meat separates readily from the bone. Then, remove 
it from the fire and pick out all of the bones. Drain off the 
liquor, saving a part of it for future use. Chop the meat up 
finely with a chopping knife. Return it to the kettle and pour 
on enough of the liquor to cover the meat. Let it boil slowly 
for 15 minutes to a half hour. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper just before remxoving from the fire. Turn it into a 
shallow pan or dish. Cover with a piece of cheese cloth and 
put on a board with a weight to make it solid. When cold it 
should be sliced thinly and served without further cooking.

THE KITCHEN GUmE 

ROAST PORK. 

Prepare pork by washing. Score the skin in lines, fonn- 
ing little squares. Have a moderately hot oven; baste with 
its own drippings; season with salt and pepper. Time re- 
quired depends on size of the roast. 

SPARE RIB. 

Cover the meat with a greased paper until half roasted; 
then, remove the paper and dredge with flour. In a few min- 
utes baste with its own gravy. Before taking up strew the 
surface with bread crumbs seasoned with sage, fine chopped 
onion, pepper and salt. Cook 5 minutes and baste again with 
butter. Skim the gravy, pour in a half cup of boiling water, 
thicken with flour, season and pour over the meat. 
PORK STEAKS. 

Remove the skin and trim neatly. Broil over a brisk fire. 
Season after taking up with pepper, salt and a little sage and 
minced onion. Cover and set in the oven for 5 minutes. Spare 
ribs can be cooked in the same manner. 

FRIED SALT PORK. 

Cut in quarter-inch slices, take off the rind, freshen, if 
very salt ; fry slowly and evenly till dry. It is a good garnish 
for fish, fish balls, tripe, etc., and is quite good enough to serve 
by itself with baked potatoes and a white gravy made like 
white sause, only the fat from the pork is used instead of but- 
ter. If there is much salt in the pan see that it is removed 
before beginning the gravy.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



LIVER AND BACON. 

Prepare the bacon as directed for breakfast bacon. Cut 
the hver in slices one-third inch thick, parboil for 5 minutes, 
dry well and roll in seasoned flour. Lay the slices in smoking 
hot bacon fat and when they are brown on each side they will 
be sufficiently cooked. 

FRIED HAM AND EGGS. 

Cut the ham into slices and take care they are the same 
thickness in every part. Cut off the rind, and, if the ham 
should be particularly hard and salty, it will be found an im- 
provement to soak it for about 10 minutes in hot water, and 
then dry it in a cloth. Put it in a cold frying pan, set it over 
the fire and turn the slices 3 or 4 times while they are cooking. 
When done, place them on a dish, which should be kept hot 
in front of the fire during the time the eggs are being poached. 
Poach the eggs; slip them on to the slices of ham and serve 
quickly. 

BOSTON PORK AND BEANS. 

^ Carefully pick a quart of small, white beans, and let them 
1^ ak over night in cold water. In the morning wash and drain 
m fresh water. Set on to boil in plenty of cold water, in which 
is a piece of soda the size of a bean. After they come to a boil 
drain again, cover again with water and boil for 15 minutes, 
or until the skin of the beans will crack when taken out and 
blown upon. Next, drain the beans, put into an earthen pot, 
with a tablespoonful of salt, and cover with hot water. Place 
in the centre of the pot a pound of salt pork, first scalding it 
with hot water, and scoring the rind across the top a quarter 
of an inch apart. Place in the oven and bake 6 hours or longer, 
keeping the oven at a moderate heat; add hot water from the 
teakettle as needed, so as to keep the beans moist. When thc| 
meat becomes crisp and looks cooked remove it, as too long 
baking destroys the solidity of the pork.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

PORK CHOPS. 

Season with salt, pepper, beat up an egg, dip the pork in 
the egg, then in cracker crumbs or cornmeal, fry in plenty of 
lard, boiling hot. 

SAUSAGES. 

3 teaspoonfuls of sifted sage, 2 teaspoonf uls white pepper, 
14 teaspoonful of allspice, 2 pounds of lean, fresh pork, 1 pound 
of fat, fresh pork, 3 tablespoonfuls of salt. 

Chop the meat, fat and lean together, very fine, and mix 
thoroughly with the seasonings. Make cotton bags the desired 
shape and length, dip them in a strong brine and dry. Attach 
the sausage stuffer to the meat chopper, and with it press the 
meat into the bags as closely as possible; tie the bags tightly 
and hang in cool place. When using sausage from these the 
end should be turned back and, after the desired amount has 
been cut off, tie closely again. Cut the sausage in slices and 
saute until brown. 

SCRAPPLE. 

Separate one small hog's head into halves. Take out the 
eyes and brains and thoroughly clean the head. Put it int® a 
large kettle, cover with 4 or 5 quarts of cold water and simmer 
gently for 2 or 3 hours, or until the meat falls from the bones. 
Skim the grease carefully from the surface, remove the meat, 
chop fine, and return it to the liquor. Season it with 1 tea- 
spoonful of powdered sage, salt and pepper. Sift in granulated 
cornmeal, stirring constantly until it is the consistency of soft 
mush. Cook slowly for 1 hour, watching carefully, as it 
scorches easily. When cooked, pour into a greased, oblong tin 
and put in a cold place. Cut in thin slices and fry crisp and 
brown.

BOILED HAM. 

Soak over night and wash hard next morning with a stiff 
brush or coarse cloth. Put on with plenty of water. Do not 
boil too fast; allow 15 minutes to each pound. Do not remove 
skin until cold. Prepare for table by garnishing with dots, 
pepper or dry mustard, and with parsley around the sides. 

ROAST HAM. 

Wash and scrape carefully and soak in cold water 24 
hours. Scrape again and dry thoroughly. Make a dough with 
2 quarts of flour and water enough for a stiff paste. Roll this 
into a sheet large enough to wrap the ham ; fold the ham in it 
and place it on meat rack in the dripping pan. Bake in a 
moderate oven 6 hours ; on taking from oven remove the paste 
and skin, sprinkle with fine crumbs and return to the oven 
for half an hour. Dust very carefully with cayenne pepper 
and baste every 5 minutes with wine, using 1 cup claret and 2 
tablespoonfuls sherry. It will be delicious either hot or cold, 
and is especially nice if served hot with champagne sauce. 

BOILED HAM. 

Cut in thin slices, soak well in scalding water, wipe dry, 

and lay in cold water for 5 minutes. Wipe again and broil over 

a clear fire. Pepper before serving. To fry ham prepare as 

for broiling, and cook in a hot frying pan, turning often. Serve 

with or without gravy. 

69 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

POTTED HAM. 

When ham is boiled there is often much waste of the 
harder portions and of pieces that do not make presentable 
slices. Take them while fresh and mince until a smooth paste 
so that the fat cannot be distinguished from the lean; there 
should be one-third fat. Allow 1 pepperspoon cayenne to each 
pound of meat and salt to taste. Heat thoroughly and pack 
firmly in small pots. 

BAKED HAM. 

Boil a 10-pound ham in water enough to cover; to this 
add 2 pounds of brown sugar. Boil 3 hours, then skim. Mix 
a tablespoonful of dry mustard and one of sugar, sprinkle 
over the fat side and bake from %, to 1 hour. 

DEVILED HAM. 
Take cold roast ham ; chop fine ; make a dressing of pepper, 
mustard and vinegar ; mix thoroughly with ham. This is very 
suitable for sandwiches. 

PORK PIE. 

One pound of pork chopped in small pieces, 4 good-sized 
potatoes chopped in squares, cover with water and cook till 
tender. Cook meat awhile before putting potatoes in. Make 
a gravy to pour over ; save out some of this gravy, to pour over 
when baked. Make a short crust same as for pies with a lit- 
tle baking powder in it. Line a small bread-pan with crust, 
put in the meat and the gravy, cover with upper crust and 
bake till brown.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

BREAKFAST BACON. 

Remove the rind, slice as thin as paper with same machine 
that is used to slice dried beef. Lay the slices in a cold pan 
and set them over a moderate fire. Watch and turn often, and 
as soon as they look opaque, tilt the pan, draw the slices up 
from the grease to dry and transfer to a thick brown paper to 
drain before laying them on the platter. They should hardly 
grease the fingers and should be perfectly crisp. 

TRYING OUT LARD. 

Only the best of fat should be used for choice lard. Leaf 
fat is the best. The back strip of the side also makes nice lard, 
as do the ham, shoulder and neck trimmings. Gut fat should 
never be mixed with the leaf and the back fat It ma'kes a 
strong-smelling lard and should be kept separate. All scraps 
of lean meat should be cut out of the fat before trying out, as 
they are very likely to stick to the kettle and get scorched, 
giving an unpleasant flavor to the lard. When preparing the 
fat for trying cut it into pieces from to 1 to 1 14 inches square. 
They are nearly equal in size, so that they will try out in about 
the same time. Fill a clean kettle about % full and put in a 
quart of water, or, if convenient, a quart of hot lard. One or 
the other is necessary to prevent the fat from burning before 
the heat is sufficient to bring out the grease. Keep the kettle 
over a moderate fire until the cracklings are brown and light 
enough to float. Frequent stirring will be necessary to pre- 
vent burning. When done remove from the stove and allow to 
cool slightly, and then strain through a muslin cloth into a 

71 .....:-... 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

large jar. Stir occasionally until it is cool enough to begin 
to solidify. If pails or smaller jars are to be filled the lard 
should be dipped out while just warm enough to be liquid. 
Stirring while the lard is cooling tends to whiten it and make 
it smoother. A l^ of a pound of saleratus added to each lOQ 
pounds of fat has a like effect. 

CLARIFIED FAT. 

Kemove the tough outside skin and lean parts from beef 
fat (cod fat or suet) or pork fat, and cut the fat into small 
pieces. Put it into a saucepan and cover it with cold water. 
Place it on the stove uncovered so that the steam may carry off 
the impurities. When the water has nearly all evaporated set 
the kettle back and let the fat slowly try out. When the fat 
is still and the scraps of skin are shriveled at the bottom of 
the kettle, strain the fat through a cloth and set away to cool. 
Render 2 pounds of beef suet and pour it over 3 pounds of lard. 
This is excellent for cooking in deep fat. 

COOKING IN DEEP FAT. 

The fat used for cooking may be olive oil, cottonseed oil, 
cottolene, beef drippings, lard, or a mixture of several fats. 

The food must be covered with crumbs and egg, or a bat- 
ter, to keep it from absorbing fat. 

Place the articles to be cooked in a bath of fat, deep 
enough to float them. The kettle should be of iron; a frying 
basket may be used. Foods already cooked or needing little 
cooking, require a higher temperature than batters. The tem- 
perature of the fat for oysters, croquettes, fish balls, etc., may 
be tested by browning a cube of bread while counting forty. 
Counting sixty while the bread browns gives the right tem- 

72 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

perature for all batters. 

All articles cooked must be drained on unglazed brown 
paper or a blotter. 

When one quantity of food has been taken from the fat, 
it must be reheated and tested before adding a second set. 

When one quantity of food has been taken from the fat, 
it must be reheated and tested before adding a second set. 

In the absence of a frying basket, a wire spoon may b« 
used to remove the food from the fat. 

Fat which has been used for frying, should be cooled amd 
clarified by cooking a few slices of raw potato in it for 10 minn- 
utes, strain through muslin and, when cold, cover. Fat May 
be used several times for frying and then may be used ia 
making soap. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

One pint cold, cooked rice, 2 or 3 tablespoons milk, 1 egg, 
2 tablespoons butter, V^ teaspoon salt, 1-16 teaspoon white 
pepper, cayenne, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. 

Warm the rice in a double boiler, with enough milk to 

soften it. Add the butter, seasoning and beaten egg, and cook 

until the egg thickens. Spread the mixture on a shallow plate 

to cool, then shape into rolls. Roll in fine bread crumbs which 

have been seasoned with salt and pepper; dip in egg, and roll 

in crumbs again. Cook in a deep fat until brown. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

Three and one-half cups chopped chicken, onion juice, 1 
tablespoon parsley, 2 teaspoons lemon juice. Make 1 pint of 
very thick cream sauce : — 1 pint of creaili and milk, ^4 cuP 
butter, iy4 cup flour, 1^ teaspoons salt, V2 teaspoon white pep- 

73 



THE KITCHEN G¥IDE 

per, 1 teaspoon celery salt, cayenne. 

Chop the chicken very fine, and add sauce to make it as 
soft as can be handled. Cool as in making rice croquettes and 
shape and cook in the same way. 

Sometimes a beaten egg is added to the sauce before mix- 
ing it with the meat. Beef and veal may be used in place of 
chicken. 

TO DRESS AND CLEAN POULTRY. 

Sing-e by holding the chicken over a flame from gas, alco- 
hol or burning? paper. 

Cut off the head, turn back the skin, and cut the neck 
off quite close; take out the wind-pipe and crop, cutting off 
close to tlie body. Cut through the skin around the leg 1 inch 
below the leg joint; take out the tendons and break the leg at 
the joint; in old birds each tendon must be removed separately 
by using a skewer. 

Remove pin feathers with the point of a knife. Remove 
oil-bag from the tail. 

The internal organs are not always removed before the 
chick-en is sold. If they have not been removed, make an open- 
ing under one of the legs, or at the vent, and remove them 
carefully, leaving a strip of skin above the vent. The intes- 
tines, gir:3ard, heart and liver should all be removed together; 
care niusb be taken that the gall bladder, which lies under the 
ilver, be aot broken; it must be carefully cut away from the 
liver. The lungs and kidneys lying in the hollows of the back- 

74 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



bone must be carefully removed. Press the heart to extrac-t 
any blood. Take off outer coat of gizzard; this, \^ith the heart 
and liver, constitutes the giblets, to be used for making the 
gravy. Wash the giblets, put into cold water, heat quickly and 
cook until tender. Tlie liver requires only a short time for 
cooking. 

Cleanse the chicken by wiping thoroughly inside and out 
With a damp cloth. Stuff and truss for roasting, or cut into 
pieces for stew or fricassee. 

TO CUT A CHICKEN TO PIECES. 

Cut off the leg and separate at the joint into the drumstick 
and second joint. Cut off the wing and remove the tip ; separ- 
ate the wing at the middle joint. Remove leg and wing from 
other side. Separate the wishbone, with the meat which is on 
it, from the breast ; cut through the ribs on either side and sep- 
arate the breast from the back ; cut the breast in half length- 
wise, and the back through the middle crosswise. The side 
bones may be cut apart lengthwise with a cleaver. There 
should be twelve pieces. The neck and the tips of the wings 
may be cooked with the giblets and used for making gravy. 

If the chicken is to be stewed, cover the pieces with boil- 
ing water and cook at that temperature for 15 minutes. Then, 
add 1 tablespoon salt, and cook at a low temperature until 
tender. Serve with a sauce. 

SAUCE FOR CHICKEN. 

2 tablespoons of butter, 14 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 
y^ teaspoon of pepper, 1 pint of stock or more, yolks of 2 eggs, 
2 tablespoons of chopped parsley. 

Prepare the sauce in the usual manner, and pour it over 
the well-beaten yolks of the eggs.

BOILED CHICKEN. 

Dress and clean. Place in kettle of boiling water deep 
enough to cover, and with a fowl weighing 4 pounds boil a 
pound of fat bacon. Skim carefully when it begins to cook 
and, after the scums cease to rise, set it back to simmer gently 
for 3 hours or more, until ready to fall apart. Add a handful 
of rice and a cup of milk to make it look white, and keep it 
under water with an inverted deep plate. Add more salt, if 
needed, about a half an hour before taking it up. Lay on a 
hot dish while the liquor is reduced to rather more than a pint, 
skim off all fat, add chopped parsley, celery and thyme and 
hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, if liked, and send to table in a 
sauce bowl. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Cut through the skin of the leg an inch or two below the 

joint; break the bone by a light blow with the back of the 

cleaver and draw out the tendons; leave the bits of leg bone 

on till the fowl is roasted ; it is much easier to fasten them in 
position and they can easily be taken off before serving. 

If the breast stands high and there is danger of scorching 
it, cover with a buttered paper. It will take to roast a chicken 
weighing 3 to 4 pounds 1 to 2 hours. 

For stuffings see page 

STEAMED CHICKEN. 

Wipe very dry after cleaning. Rub salt, pepper and plenty 
of butter in the cavity of the body ; fill with large oysters, well-

seasoned with salt, pepper and celery salt. Tie the legs and 
wings close to the body and lay in a small dish as will hold it, 
and set in a steamer to cook 4 hours. Meantime cook a pint 
of chopped celery till it will rub through a puree sieve. Make 
a pint of white sauce with the liquor of the oysters, add the 
celery to it and pour it over the fowl on the platter. Garnish 
with curly parsley and serve with baked sweet potatoes and 
boiled rice. This is a delightful way to cook a turkey. 

CHICKEN POT PIE. 

Cut the chicken into nice pieces for serving, drop them 
into just enough boiling water to cover and skim carefully 
at first. Set back to simmer, closely covered, until tender, tak- 
ing care that it does not boil dry. While it is cooking cut off 
1 pound of light bread dough, work into it a large tablespoon 
of butter, shape it into small dumplings and set them to rise; 
wash and pare potatoes, cutting to about half the size of an 
esS- Parboil for ten minutes in salted water and add them to 
the chicken when nearly done. It is well to taste and add more 
seasoning at the same time, if it is needed. When the pota- 
toes begin to boil, lay on the dumplings, first adding a cup of 
cold water or milk, to check the boiling and give the lumplings 
a chance to rise. Cover very close and do not open the lid till 
they are done, which will be from 20 to 80 minutes. Test them 
by taking out one and breaking open to see if it is cooked 
through. If one likes the dumplings dry and very light, they 
may be cooked in a steamer quite separate from the meat and 
potatoes. Make a gravy as for chicken pie, adding more water 

or milk, as may be needed — a baking powder dumpling can be

used instead of raised dough and sponge balls given to go with 
soup are excellent with pot pie. Some recipes call for onion, 
carrot and turnip, but such strong flavors are too much for the 
chicken and are better suited to beef and mutton stews. A 
tablespoon of rice and a half a cup of tomatoes are the only 
vegetables recommended. 

CHICKEN POLOE (Chicken and Rice). 

Take a pint of rice, boil it in as much water as will cover 
it; when your rice is half boiled, put in your chicken, with a 
small onion, blade or two of mace, some whole pepper, and some 
salt ; when it is tender, put the chicken in the dish and pour the 
rice over it. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Divide the chicken into pieces at the joints, boil until part 
done, about 20 minutes; then, take it out, fry 2 or 3 slices of 
fat salt pork and put in the bottom ; then, place the chicken on 
with 1 cup of water, 2 ounces of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, 
pepper to taste and cover the top with a light crust, the same 
as for biscuit. Bake in an oven that is hotter at the top than 
at the bottom, and when well-risen and brown cover with a 
paper or the crust will burn before the pie is baked through. 
Remove fat from the water in which the chicken was boiled, 
thicken with a little flour, season to taste, add 1 cup of good 
cream and, when pie is done, pour this gravy through the 
hol^ is the crust.

CHICKEN TURNOVERS. 

Chicken turnovers are a pleasing variety of chicken pies. 
Roll out trimmings of puff paste or any good pastry, and cut 
in rather large rounds. Have ready some cooked chicken, 
chopped fine and highly seasoned ; a little finely minced ham is 
an improvement. Moisten with its own gravy, if you have it ; 
if not, cream will answer. Lay a tablespoon of the mixture on 
one-half the paste, fold the other half over it, press the wetted 
ends closely together and bake in a quick oven or fry in hot 
fat, according to convenience. When fried they are called 
Rissoles. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE. 

White. Prepare the chicken by general directions, bro\vn 
in butter ; it should be done over a quick fire, but not allowed to 
take much color; cover with boiling water and simmer till 
tender; a year-old chicken should not need more than 40 min- 
utes; reduce the stock to 1 pint and use it to make a sauce 
with 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour. Season 
with 1/^ teaspoon celery salt, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, salt and 
pepper as needed. Add 1 cup hot cream and pour the sauce 
slowly over 1 well-beaten egg; stir well and put on a hot 
platter; arrange the pieces of chicken in something like the 
order in which they grow, garnish with toast pointjs and 2 
sprays of parsley laid in the center of the dish.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



FRIED CHICKEN. 
Chickens will do for frying up to 6 months old if they 
are plump and in good condition. Clean, singe and wipe with 
a wet cloth. Cut them in quarters, and season with salt and 
pepper, roll them in flour and fry in hot fat from salt pork 
until brown on both sides. Cover closely and set back to cook 
slowly till done, about 20 minutes more; dissolve the glaze 
with 2 or 3 tablespoons water and pour over the chicken. Serve 
with corn pone, if you can get sweet, soft cornmeal and have 
an open fire ; if not, with some other form of cornbread. 

CHICKEN PUDDING. 

Clean and cut 1 chicken in small pieces; simmer in a 
closely covered kettle till it begins to grow tender. Then, take 
out and lay in a baking dish, seasoning well with salt and 
pepper. Have ready a batter of 1 pound of flour, 1 teaspoon 
of salt, 1 quart of milk and 6 beaten eggs, light ; pour this mix- 
ture over the chicken, dredge thickly with flour, lay on bits 
of butter and bake in a moderate oven until set and a delicate 
brown. Make a good gravy with the water in which the 
chicken was cooked and serve with the pudding. 

POULTRY STUFFING. 

No. 1. For an 8-pound turkey take 1 quart stale bread 
crumbs; they should be of uniform size; moisten with % cup 
of butter, melted; season well with pepper and salt, use fine 
herbs, if desired, but the flavor of chicken and turkey is toa 
delicate to be covered with much seasoning. 

If the fowl is very large and a good deal of stuffing is 
liked, the body may be filled with thin slkes of bread well- 

80 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

buttered, sprinkled with seasoning and dipped lightly in stock. 
Do not crowd either crop or body or the stuffing will be heavy. 
No. 2. Soak 4 ounces dried bread in cold water until soft, 
press out all the water, add 4 ounces fine sausage meat, 1 table- 
spoon each of parsley and of onion chopped and parboiled, 2 
ounces of butter, 1 teaspoon salt, i/^ teaspoon pepper, a dash 
of nutmeg and 2 well-beaten eggs. If the sausage is quite fat 
the butter may be omitted, or chopped salt pork may be sub- 
stituted with rather more seasoning. If one objects to pork in 
any form, use a full cup of butter and an extra cup of coarse 
crumbs. 

A rich variation is as follows : Chop the liver with 1 small 
onion and brown lightly in a very little butter ; mix them with 
1 pound of sausage meat and 3 dozen chestnuts, boiled and 
blanched. 

No. 3. Stuffing with chestnuts. Remove the sinews from 
i/^-pound raw, lean veal, and the strings from the same weight 
of leaf lard; chop them separately till very fine, then pound 
vigorously till well blended; moisten i/^-pint broth, add 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 1 saltspoon pepper, 4 dozen chestnuts, blanched and 
boiled; fill the turkey, breast and body. 1 cup of the cooked 
chestnut crumbs may be reserved, mashed, sifted and used to 
thicken the gravy, this should be lightly browne4, not to cover 
the chestnut flavor. 

No. 4. For roast chicken of 3 or 4 pounds, take 1 cup 

coarse bread crumbs, moisten with butter, from ^4 to % cup, 

season well with salt, pepper and thjnne.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

ROAST TURKEY WITH OYSTERS. 

Clean a turkey and lay it in a dripping pan; prepare a 
dressing of stale bread, composed of 1 quart of bread crumbs 
and 1 cupful of butter, and water enough to moisten. Add this 
to 2 dozen of oysters and pepper and salt to taste. Mix all and 
stuff the turkey with it; and put butter over the outside; put 
some water in the dripping pan, set it in the oven and bake 
until done, basting quite often. Never parboil a young turkey. 

GRAVY FOR TURKEY. 

When the turkey is put in to roast, place the neck, heart, 
liver and gizzard in a stew-pan with a pint of water, and boil 
until they have become quite tender. Then, chop the heart and 
gizzard, mash the liver, and throw away the neck. Return 
the chopped meat to the liquor in which it was stewed. When 
the turkey is done this material should be added to the gravy 
that dripped during the roasting, the fat being first skimmed 
from the surface of the dripping pan. Set it then over the fire, 
boil 3 minutes and thicken with flour. Brown flour will not 
be needed to color the gravy. The garnishes for turkey or 
chicken are fried oysters, thin slices of ham, slices of lemon, 
fried sausages, or forcemeat balls. Parsley is also used. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Clean and wash thoroughly, rinse well in a clear water, 
wipe dry inside and out. Chop an onion fine, blanch and 
drain, fry with a little butter, mix it with well-seasoned mashed 
potatoes, adding sage, if liked ; truss and roast for 2 hours for 
a medium size, covering breast with a buttered paper for the 
first hour. Soak the giblets in salted water, scald, cook gently 
until tender in a little water, chop and add to gravy. For this 

82 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

the fat should all be poured from the dripping pan and fresh 
fat added; butter, pork fat or dripping, according to taste; 
bro\\Ti 2 level tablespoons of flour in it, blend with 1 pint 
strong stock. Pour this upon a hot platter, lay on the goose 
and garnish with apples cooked as follows : Take small, round, 
sour apples, pare smoothly and brown in butter and sugar; 
1 tablespoon of each will do for 6 apples. Stew in broth 
enough to barely cover and take out as soon as tender ; boil the 
broth to a glaze and roll the apples in it. 

ROAST DUCK. 

To really enjoy domestic duck they should be kept in a| 

small pen for a day or two and fed on barley meal or cracked/ 

wheat, with plenty of fresh water to cleanse them before they 

are dressed. As a general rule, 2 small, young ducks make 2^ 

better dish than a large drake, the flesh of which is hard and 

dry and best adapted for a stew, salmi or braise. Clean and 

truss according to general directions, except that the feet are 

generally scalded, skinned and twisted across the back, whie 

the pinions and long neck are entirely removed. Stuff and 

skewer the wings close to the side to make the breast as plunp 

as possible. Roast from 30 to 45 minutes, basting often aid 

dredging with flour. Serve with a brown gravy and w^ 

apple sauce as a side dish. 

IRISH STEWED DUCK. 

Singe, draw and cut into 8 pieces each 2 eprins duocs. 
Season with pepper and salt and fry to a light brown on b»th 
sides in butter. Add a sliced onion and 4 ounces raw, l®n 
ham, cut in dice. As soon as these have browned a litle, 
dredge with V^ ounces of flour and fry again till the floui is 

83 



THE KITCHEN GUHDE 

brown; then, add IV^ pints of beef broth, a gill of port wine, a 
bunch of parsley and sweet herbs to taste, cover closely and 
cook % of an hour. Remove the herbs, skim off all the fat and 
serve in a potato border. 

BOILED QUAIL. 

Quail, split in the back and broiled over a bright fire, with 
a dressing of salt, pepper and butter, make an excellent dish. 
Care must be taken not to cook them too fast, or the surface 
will be scorched before the bird is fairly warmed through. The 
fire should not be too hot or the gridiron rest too near it. In 
all cases game should be served on hot dishes. 
ROAST PIGEONS. 

Prepare exactly according to directions for roast chicken, 

but unless they are surely young and fat, they are much better 

to be steamed for 30 to 40 minutes before putting them into 

he oven. Use a generous measure of butter, as the meat is 

lather dry. 

BREAD. 

Bread, good bread, is of pre-eminent importance and 
siould receive our first consideration. If you have good bread 
oiher food can be added very easily; but without good bread 
everything else is as nothing. There need be no morsel of 
bead wasteii, recipes will be given for using all that has be- 
cane dry and stale. 

HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOOD FLOUR. 

To make good bread you must have the best flour, which 

is far more satisfactory and economical in the end. The best 
floir is yellowish- white ; when handled it is lively and will stick 
to the fingers. 

84 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



TO MAKE GOOD BREAD. 

Next in importance to good flour is good yeast or empt- 
ings. Flour should always be sifted and put in a warm place, 
to get thoroughly warmed and dried before the sponge is made. 
Bread is much better and more tender wet with milk than 
with water, and requires less flour and less kneading. Some 
prefer a little shortening. In making good bread, great care 
must be taken of it, mixing, kneading and baking, all require 
the closest attention. 

If milk is used, it must be new, and in warm weather it 
must be scalded, and then cooled until but lukewarm ; the bat- 
ter must be of the right temperature when the yeast is put 
in ; if hot, the life of the yeast is destroyed ; if cold, much time 
is lost in rising. 

If you cannot use all milk for wetting the flour, a part 
milk is better than aU water. If liked, put half a cup of short- 
ening, melted, in the wetting, to 1 large loaf, or added to the 
sponge after it has risen the first time. One cup of yeast to 
every 2 loaves. The dough should be kept warm from the time 
it is mixed until it is baked ; it will rise quicker and it will be 
better for it. Mix the spenge stiff; if set at night in cold 
weather, put it where it will keep warm, otherwise you kad 
better wait till morning — in summer the natural heat is suf- 
ficient. If the sponge is set at night and kept warm it will be 
light in the morning and should be kneaded at once in one large 
lump; then, let it stand to rise again, when light mold into 

85 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



loaves. The more bread is kneaded before forming the loaves, 
the better it will be, but it should be kept as soft as possible, 
using as little flour as you can ; when the loaves are formed put 
them into well-buttered pans or in rows in one large pan. Set 
the pans in a warm place for an hour, with a cloth thrown over 
them to exclude the air and dust; then, bake in an oven not hot- 
ter than you can hold your hand in while counting thirty ; keep 
a uniform fire. When baked, which will require about an hour, 
let it stand in the pans a few minutes ; then, turn out and place 
in an upright or standing position. 

Do not cover the bread up in cloths; it spoils the taste; 
turn the pans, and let it rest against them without covering. 

When cold put it away in a well-aired, clean stone crock, 
and keep it closely covered. Keep it in a cool place. You can 
add mashed boiled potatoes to any kind of bread and it will 
improve it, one teacup of potato to every loaf. Dry bread can 
be used ; first remove the crust ; then, moisten it in the wetting, 
proportioning a half loaf of the dry bread to two of new. 

HOP YEAST. 



This yeast will keep a long time ; 6 potatoes, double hand- 
ful of hops, 3 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons salt, 8 table- 
Bpoons yeast, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon ginger. Tie 
the hops in a coarse muslin bag. Boil in 2 quarts of water. 
Grate the potatoes; pour on them the hop water, boiling hot, 
of which there must be 1 quart, which forms a starch ; add the 
flour, salt, sugar, ginger, stir thoroughly and set aside until 
lukewarm; then, add 3 tablespoons of good yeast; set it in a 
warm place to rise; when light and spongy, which will take 

86 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

about 3 or 4 hours, put it in a jug that can be corked airtight, 
and keep it in a cool place. After the first time some of the 
yeast can be saved to raise the next with. 

SALT RISING, OR EMPTINGS. 

Pour a pint of boiling hot water into a 2-quart bowl or 
pail on a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, V2 teaspoon of sugar; when the 
finger can be held in it, add enough flour to make a stiff hatter ; 
mix well and set it in a warm kettle of water; keep it at the 
same temperature until the batter is nearly twice its original 
bulk, which will be in 5 to 8 hours. It may be stirred once or 
twice during the rising. The salt rising can be set at night, 
the kettle being left in a warm oven, and will be risen by morn- 
ing. Add this to a sponge made of 1 quart of warm water 
and 2^ quarts of flour, adding as much more as may be neces- 
sary to make a soft dough; mix well, and leave it in a warm 
place to rise; when light mold into loaves, keeping as soft aa 
possible; lay them in buttered tins and when light, prick and 
bake. 

BREAD. 
GENERAL RULES. 

Use flour containing a large per cent, of gluten, or a flour 

called wheat flour. 

Flour should be kept in a dry atmosphere. It makes bet- 
ter bread if heated just before using it. 

If milk is used heat it to prevent souring. 
Milk and water are both used lukewarm. 
The yeast must be fresh. 

Half cake of yeast should be used with 1 quart liquid, if 

87 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

the bread is set at night. 

One cake of yeast should be used with 1 quart of liquid, 
if set in the morning. 

Dissolve 1 yeast cake in 1 cup lukewarm water. 

Loaves of bread should be baked 1 hour or more in a hot 
oven. 

Place on the grate 10 minutes; then, remove to the floor 
of the oven. 

The heat of the oven should increase slightly during first 
20 minutes and should be kept even for 20 minutes and should 
decrease during last 20 minutes. When baked, the loaves should 
be cooled, uncover on a wire rack. 

Biscuits require more heat than loaves of bread. 

Bread should be kept in a clean tin box and not exposed 
to moisture.

add the yeast, then the flour gradually. When stiff enough to 

kandle, turn the dough out on a floured board and knead until 

soft and elastic. Put back into the bowl, moisten, cover and 

let it rise in a warm place until double its bulk; then, divide 

into loaves, or shape into biscuits. Allow these to rise in the 

pan in which they are to be baked. Cover the bread and again 

allow it to double in bulk ; then, bake

USES FOR STALE BREAD. 
DRIED BREAD CRUMBS. 

Crusts and small pieces of bread should be dried in a 
cool oven until a light brown. Roll them on a pastry board, or 
put through a meat grinder. Crumbs must be sifted. Use 
them only to cover articles of food cooked in deep fat. 

Crumbs should be kept in jars with a piece of muslin tied 
over them. 

93 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

CROUTONS. 

Cut pieces of stale bread into cubes and brown in oven. 

SIPPETS. 

Cut bread into thin slices, and then into strips 5 inches 
long and li/o inches wide, and toast them. 

CANAPES. 

Cut bread into pieces 2 inches thick, cut either round or 
41/^ inches long by 3 inches wide. Remove part of the bread 
from the center, butter, and brown in the oven 

SOUP STICKS. 

Cut stale bread in 1-3-inch slices, remove crusts, butter, 
and cut in 1-3-inch strips ; brown in the oven. 

FRENCH TOAST. 

One or 2 eggs, ^4 teaspoon salt, 1 cup of milk, 6 or 8 
slices of stale bread. 

Beat the eggs slightly, add salt and milk, dip the bread 
in the mixture. Have a griddle hot and well-buttered ; brown 
the bread on 1 side, place a small piece of butter on top of 
each piece, turn and brown on the other side. Serve hot with 
cinnamon and sugar or a sauce. 

CREAM TOAST.

salt, 2 cups of milk or cream, 6 or 8 slices of toast. 

Heat the butter; when it bubbles add the flour and salt, 
add gradually the hot milk, stirring constantly and allowing 
the mixture to thicken each time. Pour this sauce over dry 
or moist toast. Moist toast is prepared by quickly dipping 
dry toast into hot salted water or hot milk. A plainer sauce 
may be made by using 2 tablespoons of butter. 

94 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

TOAST. 

Cut stale bread into slices i4.-inch thick ; put it on a toaster 
or fork, move it gently over the heat until dry. Then allow it 
to become a light brown by placing it nearer the heat and turn- 
ing constantly. It may be first dried in the oven. Hot milk 
may be poured over dry toast. 

ZWIEBACK. 

Cut bakers' or other light bread into 1-inch slices and 
brown in a moderate oven. 

MIXTURES WITH BAKING POWDER. 

Pastry flour should be used, if possible. Flour must be 
sifted before it is measured; then, mix and sift dry ingredi- 
ents. 

Six teaspoons baking powder will raise 1 quart of flour. 

The eggs are beaten whole and the milk added to them; 

then added to the dry ingredients. When fat is used it is 

usually melted and added last, but may be worked into the 

flour with the tips of the fingers or cut in with a knife. 

The pans, or muffin rings, should be greased before the 
mixture is prepared. Iron gem pans must be heated. 

The oven must be ready for baking before the mixtures 
are prepared and baked from 12 to 30 minutes. Bake on the 
floor of the oven ; they may be raised to the shelf to brown. 

BISCUITS. 

Two cups flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon

The dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched 
with the hands. It should be rolled in one direction only and 
on one side, using but little flour. The dough is rolled thin and 
baked until brown. 

Meat and oyster pies should be made without an under- 
crust. The crust should be cut in several places to allow the 
steam to escape. 

In making lemon pies the under-crust should be baked on 
the outside of a tin plate, then filled. In this case the crust 
must be pricked all over with a fork so that it may keep its 
shape. 

When two crusts are used, they should be moistened 
around the edge with cold water, then pressed slightly together. 

The paste may be made the day before using; then, cov- 
ered and placed on ice. It rolls more easily if placed on ice 
after mixing. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 

One and one-quarter cups of pastry flour, 1 teaspoon bak- 
ing powder (if used), 14 teaspoon salt, 1-3 or 1/2 cup of fat, ice 
water. Mix in order given.

MINCE MEAT. 
One quart of apples, measured after chopping; i/t cup 

of candied orange peel, grated rind and juice of 1 lemon, 14, cup 
of candied lemon peel, grated rind and juice of 1 orange, 1 
teaspoon of cinnamon, ^4, cup of candied fruit, 1/2 teaspoon of 

allspice, Va teaspoon of cloves, 2 pounds of lean beef, 3 cups of 

raisins, 1/2-POund of citron, 1/2 cup of molasses, 2 teaspoons of

died lemon and orange peel and slice the citron. Add the meat 
and suet with the currants, spices and salt. Mix and add the 
sugar, m.olasses, lemon and orange juice ; when well-mixed add 
the brandy and cider. It should stand several days before 
using to ripen or blend, and should keep all winter. 2 cups of 
hard cider may be used in place of the brandy, and the quanti- 
ties of beef, suet and apples may be doubled to the amount of 
fruit given if desired. If this is done, be careful to add suf- 
ficient moistening and, remember, that the liquor is added to 
keep the mince meat, not especially for flavoring, as the quan- 
tity is so small that this is disseminated in cooking.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

CEREALS. 

Remove foreign substances from the cereal. A double 
boiler is the best utensil for cooking cereals. Fill the lower 
part 1-3 full of boiling water; it must be kept rapidly boiling 
while the cereal is cooking. If more water is needed before 
the cooking is completed, boiling water must be used. 

Boil the water, add the salt and the cereal slowly; place 
directly over the heat and cook from 10 to 15 minutes, stirring 
to prevent burning; place over the boiling water and steam 
until cooked. 

Cereals should be purchased in small quantities and kept 
in air-tight jars securely covered. In large quantities it is 
difficult to prevent infection from insect life. Mix the finer 
preparations with little cold water; then, add to the boiling 
water. This prevents the mixture cooking unevenly in lumps. 
Allow 1 teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal. 

Mush may be poured into a bread-pan, which has been 
wet with cold water. When cold, cut in 1-3-inch slices, dip in 
flour, and fry in a small amount of fat. 

Any cold mush may be thinned with cream, milk or water, 
and served as a gruel. 

All cereal preparations, grains, meals or flours may be 
used for gruels; also plain crackers powdered. Gruels must 
be thoroughly cooked, strained, seasoned and served very hot. 

Gruels made with meal are made by pouring the meal into 
the boiling water. They should be cooked for 3 hours over 
boiling water. When gruels are made from flour, the flour 
must be first mixed to a smooth, thin paste, with Vs cup cold 
water or mJlk; then, stirred into the hot liquid. They should 
be cooked at least 1 hour. 

If gruels are too thick add liquid to make them the right 
consistenc5^ 

A double boiler must be used for gruels made of milk. 
Sugar, stick cinnamon, whole cloves, nutmeg, raisins, 

lemon rind, fruit juice, meat extracts, or stimulants may be 

used to flavor gruels.

VEGETABLES. 
GENERAL RULES. 
Wash thoroughly, pare or scrape, if skins must be re- 
moved. Stand in cold water until cooked, to keep them crisp 
and to prevent their being discolored. Cook in boiling water; 
the water must be kept at the boiling point. Use 2 teaspoons 
of salt with quart of water; put the salt into the water when 
the vegetables are partially cooked. The water in which vege- 
tables are cooked is called vegetable stock. 

Fresh, green vegetables require less water than others. 
Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and turnips should be cooked

uncovered in a large amount of water. 

All vegetables must be drained as soon as tender. Season 
with salt and pepper and serve hot with butter and sauce. 

The color may be kept in green vegetables, as spinach, by- 
pouring cold water through them after draining. 

Cold vegetables may be used for salads, or may be placed 
in a baking dish with one-half the quantity of sauce (2 cups 
vegetable and 1 cup sauce), covered with buttered crumbs and 
browned in a hot oven.

Three tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 teaspoon 
salt, white pepper, 1 cup milk, 1 cup stock. 
Cook as directed for cream sauce. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

Without the Skins. 
Pare very thin, so as to preserve the starch, much of v/hich 
lies next the skin. To this the mealyness of the potato is 
due. Leave them half an hour in cold water; then, put in 
slightly-salted, boiling water, and boil gently till tender. Drain, 
salt and dry over the fire. Some varieties of potatoes cook 
best by putting on in cold water and bringing to a boil ; others 
best as directed above. 

With the Skins. 

Select potatoes of uniform size, wash well in salted water 
and boil till a fork will penetrate with ease to the center of the 
largest. Then, pour off the water, sprinkle with salt, and dry 
over the fire. Peel quickly and serve in an open dish.

apart, and let it lay for half an hour in plenty of cold, salted 
water; meantime, cut a pound of fat salt pork in inch pieces, 
put it over the fire in 2 quarts of cold water, and let the water 
gradually heat and boil; in half an hour put in the cabbage, 
after cutting it in rather small pieces, and boil it steadily for 
half an hour; then, drain off the water, see that the pork and 
cabbage are palatably seasoned, and serve them together. An 
onion quartered, and put on top of the cabbage while boiling, 
will prevent its being indigestible.

SUMMER SQUASH. 

When young and tender this can be fried in the same 
manner as eggplant. Winter squash takes much longer to 
cook and should be soaked in cold water for 2 hours or more 
before cooking. Cold, stewed squash can be used by taking 
2 cups squash, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons of flour, V^ cup of milk 
and a small piece of butter. Fry in hot lard. 
STEWED PUMPKIN. 

Cut in two, remove the seeds, slice and pare. Soak for 
an hour in cold water; then, put in boiling water and stew

STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS. 

Wash half a dozen large green peppers, put them in boil- 
ing water 5 minutes, rub off the skins with a wet cloth, cut off 
the stem, remove the seeds and stuff the peppers with any kind 
of cold meat minced fine and an equal amount of stale bread. 
Replace the stems, set the peppers in a deep dish, pour in as 
much cold gravy as the dish will hold and bake in a moderate 
oven for half an hour. They may be stuffed with sausage 
meat and bread. Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Plunge them into boiling water to remove the skins, drain 
and peel, cut into small pieces, add a small onion and cook over 
moderate heat ; a long, slow cooking improves the flavor. Just 
before removing from the stove add a pinch of baking soda; 
then, butter and seasoning. They may be thickened with 
cracker crumbs or bread crumbs, or sweetened with sugar. 

IRISH POTATO CAKE. 

Peel, boil and mash 4 or 5 potatoes. Or, if you have cold 
mashed potatoes left over from dinner, they will do as well. 
Put them in a mixing pan with about half as much flour as 
you have potato. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 tablespoons 
of dripping. Work between the hands until all lumps are 
gone. Add 14 cup of milk and work into a soft dough. Dis- 
solve 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in a little warm water and 
work this into the dough. 

Roll out Vss-iiich thick and cut into irregular shapes. Bake 
upon a well-greased griddle, turning to brown each side. Split, 
butter, close again upon the butter and pile upon a hot plate. 

A teaspoon of carraway seeds mixed into the dough will 
improve the cakes.

CHEESE. 

GENERAL RULES. 

Cheese should not be tightly covered. 

When it becomes dry and hard, grate and keep covered 
until ready to use. It may be sprinkled into soups or added 
to starchy foods. 

Soda, in cheese dishes which are cooked, makes the cheese 
more digestible. 

A soft, crumbly cheese is best for cooking. 

TOAST AND CHEESE.

EGGS. 

GENERAL RULES. 

Eggs form a valuable food and should be used as a sub- 
stitute for meats and in combination with starchy foods. 
Fresh eggs should always be used, if obtainable. 

They should be kept in a cool place. 

The yolk of an egg may be kept frona hardening by cover- 
ing it with cold water if unbroken, or with paraffin paper. 

If eggs are placed in boiling water and allowed to boil, 
*e white becomes tough and indigestible; and the yolk under- 
cooked; therefore, they should be cooked at a temperature 
below boiling point. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS. 

Place the eggs in boiling water, reirtove from fire, cover, 
aael allow them to stand from 5 to 8 minutes. 

HARD COOKED EGGS. 

Place the eggs in cold water, cover, and when the water 
beiis remove from the fire and allow them to stand 20 minutes 
©n the back of the stove ; then, put into cold water.

POACHED EGGS. 

Break each egg into a saucer, slip the egg into bmling 
water, cover, remove to cooler part of fire and cook 5 minutes 
or until the white is firm, and a film has formed over the yolk. 
Take up with a skimmer, drain, trim off the rough edges, and 
serve on slices of toast. Season. 

FRIED EGGS. 
Break shells and drop the eggs, one by one, in hot fat; 
dip the fat over them until the white is set ; dust with pepper 
and salt and serve hot ; cook from 3 to 5 minutes, according to 
taste. These are less digestible than poached eggs. 
SCRAMBLED EGGS. 
Beat 6 eggs very light; add a little salt, 8 tablespoons of 
milk, and a small lump of butter. Put in a hot skillet aad stfa: 
constantly until the eggs harden. 

PICKLED EGGS. 
Six hard-boiled eggs, with 4 whole cloves stuck in each;

spoon of mustard, with a little cold vinegar ; let 1 pint of vine- 
gar come to a boil, add the spice and cook 1 minute, pour boil- 
ing hot over the eggs, in a glass jar, cover closely. A few 
pieces of boiled beet in the vinegar will turn them a pretty 
pink. 

DEVILED EGGS. 

Remove the shells from V2-dozen of hard-boiled eggs, cut 
in halves, take out yolks. Ground up the same quantity of 
ham, tongue or salt meat as the yolks of the eggs. Mix to- 
gether and season to tapte; refill the whites and serve witk

ICE CREAM. 
GENERAL RULES. 

The can, cover and dasher of the freezer should be scald- 
ed and then chilled before the mixture which is to be frozen 
is placed in it. Adjust the can carefully in the tub before 
packing. Pour in the mixture, put in the dasher, cover, adjust 
the crank and pack with finely chopped ice and rock salt; this 
must be higher around the can than the mixture inside. 

Use 3 times as much ice as salt for freezing; use 4 times 
as much ice as salt in packing. 

In freezing ice cream the crank should be turned slowly 
and steadily; in freezing sherbet the crank should be turned 
rapidly and steadily ; in freezing water ice or frozen fruit turn 
the crank steadily 5 minutes, allow it to stand 5 minutes, turn 
again 5 minutes and continue until freezing is completed. 

When mixture is frozen, remove ice and salt from around 

the top of the can; wipe cover and top; uncover and remove 

dasher, scrape it ; then, beat frozen mixture with wooden spoon 

or paddle 5 minutes ; place paraffine paper or heavy paper over 

can ; cover and put cork in hole. Drain off all the water which

moved until freezing is completed; repack the freezer, putting 
ice and salt over the top, cover with carpet, blanket or news- 
paper and allow it to stand in a cold place several hours. 

A tightly-covered tin can and a wooden pail may be sub- 
stituted for an ice cream freezer, using a wooden spoon or 
paddle to scrape the mixture from the sides and bottom of the 
can as it freezes. 

In preparing frozen fruits or water ice the sugar and 
water should be made into a syrup, which should be boiled 
5 minutes; then, strained; in preparing ice cream with fruit 
the sugar and crushed fruit should stand 1 hour in a cool 
place, or until the sugar is dissolved; then, add cream and 
freeze ; in preparing ice cream without fruit the cream should 
be scalded and the sugar dissolved in it; cool, add flavoring 
and freeze. 

Fruit juice is used for water ice; the fruit is pressed 
through a colander or cut in small pieces with a silver knife 
for frozen fruit; either juice or crushed fruit may be used for 
ice cream; it is preferable to use only the juice of very seedy 
fruits.

THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



SALADS. 

Salads may be garnished with blossoms and leaves of nastur- 
tiums, parsely, beets, or hard-cook ed eggs cut in slices, or the hard- 
cooked yolks of eggs may be but through a vegetables press 
and sprinkled over the salad. 

Lettuce, celery or cress should stand in cold water to grow 
crisp. Carefully look over and wash thoroughly and dry on 
a towel. Tear the leaves of the lettuce apart ; do not cut. Ar- 
range them in a bowl with the larger leaves on the outside. 
Put the center of the head in the middle of the bowl. When 
celery is cut for celery salad, dry very thoroughly before mix- 
ing with the dressing. Cut a hard cabbage into quarters with 
a sharp knife and soak in cold water 1 hour before using. 
Then, cut in thin slices with a sharp knife or a cabbage cutter. 

BOILED DRESSING WITH OIL. 

Two tablespoons of mustard, 1 teaspoon of salt, cayenne, 
1 tablespoon of sugar, 4 eggs (yolks), 1/2 cup of vinegar, 
2-3 cup of oil.

and season with 4 tablespoons of vinegar, 2 tablespoons of oil, 
1 teaspoon of salt, 1^ teaspoon of pepper. Set it away in a 

162 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

cold place for 2 or 3 hours. Scrape and wash enough of the 
tender, white celery to make 1 quart. Cut this, with a sharp 
knife, in pieces about half an inch thick. Put these in the 
ice chest until serving time. Make the mayonnaise dressing. 
Mix the chicken and the celery together, and add half of the 
dressing. Arrange in a salad bowl or on a flat dish, and pour 
the remainder of the dressing over it. Garnish with white 
celery leaves; or, have a jelly border, and arrange the salad 
in this. Half celery and half lettuce is often used for chicken 
salad. If, when the chicken or fowl is cooked, it is allowed 
to cool in the water in which it is boiled, it will be juicier and 
tenderer than if taken from the water as soon as done. 

SALADS. 

LOBSTERS. 

Be sure they are alive. Small ones, heavy for their size, 
are the best. Those with hard shell, streaked with black, are 
full of meat. If they are bought after being cooked, the tail 
should spring back quickly when straightened, otherwise the 
lobster was dead before cooking. 

Cook in boiling water from 20 to 30 minutes, according 
to the size ; when done, place in cold water. If cooked too long 
they will be tough. 

Break off the claws, separate tail from body, and body 
from shell, leaving the stomach, or lady, in the shell. Save 
the coral, crush the tail by pressing the sides together; then, 
pull, or cut it open, on the under side, and take out the meat 
in one piece, remove the canal^ which runs the entire length. 
Break off the gills on the body before picking the meat from 

163 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 

the joints. The gills, stomach and canal are the only parts 
not eaten. The latter varies in color from almost black to 
pink or white. Break the body in the middle lengthwise and 
pick the meat from the joints. Pound the claws carefully, 
80 the meat may be removed without being crushed. 

The meat should not be kept more than 18 hours after 
cooking. Season with salt and cayenne, pack in a covered 
jar and place on ice. If French dressing is to be used on the 
meat, omit salt and cayenne from that recipe. 
FRENCH DRESSING. 

One-quarter teaspoon of salt, % teaspoon of pepper, 

1 tablespoon of vinegar, 3 tablespoons of oil. 

Pour the ingredients into a bottle and shake well. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 
One teaspoon of mustard, V2 teaspoon of salt, yolks of 

2 eggs, 1 cup of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of vinegar or lemon 
juice, cayenne. 

Mix mustard, salt, cayenne, until well-blended. Add the 
yolks ; then, add a few drops of oil, beating with an egg beater 
or a wooden spoon. 

When it begins to thicken add a little vinegar ; then, alter- 
nately the remainder of the oil and the vinegar. It should be 
a thick dressing. If it curdles, take the yolk of an egg and 
add gradually the dressing to it, beating until all is used. 
POTATO SALAD. 

Cut cooked potatoes into cubes. Use French dressing 
in sufficient quantity to cover them. Small pieces of onion 
may be used with it, or onion juice added to the dressing. 
Boiled dressing may be used over the potatoes. 

164 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



BACON FAT SALAD DRESSING. 

Cut l^-pound very fat bacon or ham into small dice. 
Fry gently till the oil burns a very light brown color; remove 
from the fire and add 1-3 vinegar to 2-3 bacon fat. Pour over 
the salad, already seasoned with pepper, salt and such herbs 
as are wished. If the bits of bacon are objectionable, pour 
through a strainer, but their savory crispness is generally an 
improvement. 

Anyone who does not like the taste of butter will find it 
an improvement for dressing vegetables. 

¥/ATERCRESS SALAD. 

Watercress is a very acceptable spring salad plant, and 
its pungent flavor is considered a good whet for jaded appe- 
tites. A plain salad dressing is the most appropriate. Small 
herbs may be added if liked. 

DELAWARE SALAD. 

Choose soft, yet firm, curd of cottage cheese, cut in inch 
dice, season with salt, pepper and cayenne and serve on lettuce 
with mayonnaise dressing. 

COLD MEAT SALAD. 

Cut the cold meat into very thin slices. Chop 1 small 
onion and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Mix in a salad bowl with

SANDWICHES. 

Sandwiches may be made of white, whole wheat, Graham 
or brown bread, with any kind of meat, fish, salad, eggs, soma 
vegetables, jams or chopped nuts, and spread with butter or 
mayonnaise dressing. Fish should be flaked very fine with 
a fork, and mixed with a fork, to a paste with the seasonings. 

The bread should not be too fresh to cut well, nor will 
actually stale bread make good sandwiches. It is best when 
about a day old, should be of a fine grain, and be trimmed to 
good shape before the sandwiches are cut. 

The crusts should not be left on, but removed, dried and 
put through the chopper for crumbs. The butter must be 
absolutely fresh and good, for, in softening, that the bread 
may be properly spread, any foreign flavor or odor will be 
brought out. For meat, fish, salad and egg sandwiches the 
bread should be cut in squares, oblongs or triangles ; for jam 
and nut sandwiches it is usually cut round. 

It is usually better to spread the bread with butter before 
cutting off each slice. This is not necessary when mayonnaise 
dressing is used. Chop the meat fine, season to taste with 
salt, pepper, chopped mustard, if desired; onion or celery 
extract, or any other of the various seasonings. 

The white meat of chicken or turkey, or veal, after being 
chopped, may be mixed with the equal quantities of the yolks 
of hard-boiled eggs, mixed smooth with cream or melted but- 
ter. Season to taste. 

171 



THE KITCHEN GUIDE 



FLOWER, FRUIT OR VEGETABLE BUTTER. 

Wrap new, fresh butter in paraffin paper. Place a thick 
layer of the desired blooms, leaves or vegetables in the bottom 
of a bowl, put the butter on top of this; then, cover thickly 
with more leaves. Cover the bowl as tightly as possible and 
set away in a cool room for at least 3 hours. The result will 
be faintly suggestive of the blossoms, leaves or vegetables. 

EGG SANDWICHES. 

Chop the whites of hard-boiled eggs very fine. Mix the 
yolks smooth with well-seasoned mayonnaise dressing; add 
the whites and spread on the bread. 

TONGUE SANDWICHES. 

Smoked tongue makes delicious sandwiches, if sliced very 
thinly and put between pieces of buttered rye or white bread. 
Mustard may be used with them, if liked. 

PICNIC SANDWICHES. 

Cut thin slices from a tender, cold, roast leg of lamb. Lay 
the slices together and cut them into small bits. Lay them on 
thin slices of fresh bread and butter ; spread the corresponding 
slice with thick mint sauce and put the two together. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 

Butter the bread on the loaf, having first creamed the 
butter. Cut off the crusts and, beginning at 1 corner of the 
slice, roll it tightly over 2 sticks of celery. The butter will 
hold it together. The celery should be broken into thin strips 
about the size of the smallest stalk, toward the leaf end, and 
also cut an appropriate length.
