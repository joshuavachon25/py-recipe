HOW TO PLAN MEALS IN WAR TIME 

WITH ECONOMICAL MENUS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR MARKETING 

PART I 

Emergency Dietaries Without Special Limitation Upon Cost 

Upon the United States of America has fallen the duty of furnish- 
ing sustenance for a vast number of people, at a time when shortage 
of certain staple crops renders the fulfilling of the obligation pecu- 
liarly difficult. Our hope of success rests upon the hearty cooperation 
of all the people in the undertaking. The first and most pressing 
task is to avoid waste of even the smallest particles of food material. 
This is a service in which every one can participate, at least by cheer- 
fully eating what is set before him and 'clearing his plate' every 
time, thus preventing food which has been sent to the table returning 
to the kitchen, there in danger of being consigned to the garbage 
pail. Those who cook can serve gloriously by letting nothing be 
burned or spilled, and by taking such pains that no one is tempted 
to leave partly eaten food to its fate. 

Besides prevention of waste, it is our duty so to distribute food 
between our allies and ourselves that our allies have those things 
which are most useful to them and most suitable for transportation. 
This means that one of the staples which we must use sparingly is 
wheat. And since thirty-one per cent, of the fuel value of the 
American diet has hitherto consisted of wheat flour and bread, 
doing without considerable quantities of wheat necessitates some 
modification of our ordinary eating habits. 

Furthermore, the general shortage of food materials lays upon us 
the necessity of saving grain by raising fewer animals for meat. 
The average American spends about one-third of his food money for 
meat, so that any considerable reduction in his meat consumption 
will result in a distinct alteration in the character of his meals. 

Finally, in such times of stress, when thousands are starving, 
others should not be eating more than they need and storing the 
surplus in their own bodies as fat, when it ought to go to those who 
need it to sustain life itself. Hence, a general program of abstemious 



4 HOW TO PLAN MEALS IN WAR TIME 

living is in order. While it is not probably true that in the long run 
most people eat too much, there are some who habitually overeat, 
and others who do so spasmodically, and all well-nourished adults 
could afford to be more abstemious for a while. 

With such points as these in mind, a week's menus have been 
planned, in which other cereals largely take the place of wheat, and 
meat is used in very moderate amounts. Potatoes are also used 
sparingly on account of their present scarcity. Quantities of food 
sufficient for the maintenance of an adult man who is not doing 
heavy manual labor have been indicated in market lists. For very 
active men, for women, and for children, suitable modifications have 
been suggested. 

GENERAL PLAN OF MEALS 

Breakfast: Fruit, cereal, bread in some form, coffee or other beverage, eggs if 
desired. 

Luncheon: One substantial dish accompanied by a vegetable, bread and butter, 
fruit or other simple dessert. 

Dinner: Meat or a suitable substitute, potatoes or a suitable substitute, a green 
vegetable, bread and butter, and a dessert. 

The following suggestions are made as to the use of cereals, bread- 
stuffs, meat and potatoes :

GENERAL PLAN FOR PURCHASE OF FOOD MATERIALS 

To exercise proper supervision over food supplies, so as to detect 
undue waste and other extravagance, it is necessary to know some- 
thing of the amounts of different classes of food materials which 
taken together will insure adequate nourishment, and permit of the 
following of some special meal plan, such as that outlined above. 
The Diet List below is arranged for the average man not engaged in 
hard manual labor. To provide for a man at active manual labor 
or boys over twelve the amounts would need to be increased one- 
fifth or one-fourth; for active women, and girls over twelve, they 
would be fully adequate in most cases; for children under twelve, 
somewhat less food would be required, but the milk should be in- 
creased to one quart per capita. For children under eight the meat 
could be omitted entirely. 

DIET LIST 

Milk, adults i pint; children, i quart Sugar (including molasses and 

Meat or fish, 4 to 6 ounces, butcher's syrup), 2 to 3 ounces 

weight 1 Eggs, i to 2 

Cereals, 3 to 4 ounces Potatoes or equivalent in cereals or 

Breadstuflfs (including flour), 5 to 6 otherroot vegetables, 4 to 5 ounces 

ounces Fruits and green vegetables, ad lib- 
Fats (for table and cooking), 2 to 4 Hum 

ounces 

ONE week's MENUS EMBODYING ABOVE SUGGESTIONS 

These menus are made out upon the above per capita basis and 
will furnish an adequate diet provided fruits and vegetables are 
included each day and the amounts indicated are taken to mean food 

1 Milk, peas, beans, cheese, or peanut butter may take its place wholly or in part.

in any menu proposed for adults are always necessary. For illus- 
trations of the best types of meals for children other publications

PART II 
Emergency Dietaries At Minimum Cost 

Higher prices for food, when the ordinary expenditure is barely 
sufficient for the maintenance of a family in good nutritive condition, 
threaten the undermining of health unless it is possible by choice of 
more economical food materials to provide the same nutriment 
without greater expenditure. And even if the family income is 
sufficient to allow ordinarily a rather liberal sum for food, the in- 
crease of prices upon other commodities makes it necessary for many 
to practice hitherto unthought of economies in the kitchen. 

In rearranging any dietary plan, it is important to bear in mind 
that the less money there is available for food, the more important 
milk and cereals become. As a people, we have been extravagant in 
the use of meat, and we must now remember that its cost is out of 
all proportion to its nutritive value; and that except as regards 
pleasing the palate, its place can be well taken by milk, cheese, 
dried peas and beans, and peanut butter. The most conspicuous 
difference between butter and other forms of fat is its flavor, for 
which we pay so dearly that where the strictest economy is to be 
practiced no butter should be bought unless it is as cheap as any 
other fat which we might use in its place â€” which is rarely the case. 
The chief advantages of fresh fruits and vegetables are their delight- 
ful flavor and texture, and these, too, we may forego in large measure 
without any nutritional disadvantage, using dried and canned fruits 
and vegetables instead. 

For the man doing moderately severe manual labor, and requiring 
from 3000 to 3500 calories per day, it is hardly possible at the 
present time to provide a wholesome and palatable diet, adequate 
in all respects, at a cost of less than 30 cents per day. The general 
plan upon which food selection must be based is shown below. 

CHOICE OF FOOD MATERIALS TO SECURE 3OOO TO 35OO CALORIES AT 
MINIMUM COST IN AN ADEQUATE DIET 

(Approximate) 
Bread and cereals 14 ounces 1000 calories 

Milk I pint 350 calories 



EMERGENCY DIETARIES AT MINIMUM COST II 

(Approximate) 

Fats (drippings, oleomargarine, lard substitutes) 2 ounces 425 calories 

Potatoes or equivalent in other root vegetables 5 ounces 100 calories 

Sugar or molasses 3 ounces 350 calories 

Dried fruit 2% ounces 200 calories 

Greens or other fresh vegetables according to season 10-50 calories 

Meat ^ (butcher's weight, 2]4. ounces lean meat) 7 ounces 100-150 calories 

, The lower the cost of the dietary, the more important it is that 
attention be given to the food for the young children. Care must 
be taken that money which should go for the milk so important for 
children's growth is not spent for meat to please the adults. The 
following is proposed as a good working plan for feeding a family 
adequately at a minimum cost. 

GENERAL PLAN OF MEALS FOR LOW-COST DIETARY 

Breakfast: Cereal (oatmeal, cornmeal, barley), bread (corn, rye, wheat), oleo- 
margarine, coffee for adults, milk for children to drink, sugar and 
milk for cereal and coffee. 

Dinner: Meat, fish, dried peas or beans, cheese, in stew, loaf or other hot dish,^ 
potatoes or other root vegetables, or rice, hominy, barley, greens 
according to season, bread (rye, corn, wheat, or made from flour 
mixtures), oleomargarine, cereal or milk pudding (rice, cornstarch, 
tapioca, cornmeal, oatmeal), or dried fruit with gingerbread or 
cookies, milk for young children to drink. 

Supper: Cream soup or puree of rice, hominy, cornmeal or macaroni combined 
with cheese or peanut butter, bread (corn, rye, wheat), oleomar- 
garine, dried fruit or cereal pudding, milk for children to drink. 

ONE week's MENUS FOR A FAMILY AT MINIMUM COST 

In harmony with the above general plan the following menus ^ 
have been prepared, with accompanying market orders for the day 
and the week, for a family consisting of two adults (father and 
mother) and four children, all under nine years of age. These menus 
provide about 12,500 calories per day and at the present time cost 
about $1.15 per day. 

1 To be replaced frequently by dried peas and beans, cheese, peanut butter. 

2 For recipes for meat substitutes see Teachers College Bulletin, Economical Diet and Cookery 
in Time of Emergency. 

' One week's menus from Stern and Spitz's Food for the Worker (Whitcomb and Barrows, 1917) 
were taken as the starting point, being adapted here to emergency conditions and family require- 
ments.
