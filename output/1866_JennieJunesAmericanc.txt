"What does cookery mean?" 

" It means the knowledge of Medea, and of Circe, and of Calypso, and of Helen, 
and of Rebekah, and of the Queen of Sheba. It means the knowledge of all 
fruits, and herbs, and balms, and spices — and of all that is healing, and sweet in 
fields, and erroves, and savory in meats— it means carefulness, and inventiveness, 
and watchfulness, and willingness, and readiness of appliance It means the 
economy of your great-grandmothers, and the science of modern chemists — it 
means much tasting, and no wasting — it means English thoroughness, and 
French art, and Arabian hospitality, and it means in fine, that you are to be per- 
fectly, and always 'ladies,' — 'loaf givers,' and as you are to see imperatively that 
everybody has something pretty to put on, — so you are to see, even yet more im- 
peratively, that everybody has something nice to eat." — Euskin.

TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS OF AMERICA* 



li^TRODUCTION. 



" Why another cook-book, when there are ah*eady so 
many?" 

Well, for several reasons, one of which is, that when an 
inquiry was made for a good, practical cook-book, we 
knew not which to recommend. We examined a great 
many, and found some good for one thing, and some for 
another; but few containing just what young, middle class 
housekeepers want to know — arranged in a clear, avail- 
able form, unencumbered with unnecessary and wordy 
details. 

A very small number of the printed cookery and house- 
keeping books have been written by women, and still less 
by persons possessing any practical knowledge of the sub- 
ject of which they w^ere treating. The majority are 
clumsy compilations of all kinds of receipts — good, bad, 
and indifferent, collected from various sources, and put 
together with an ignorance as profound, of their results, 
as if they had been written in an unknown language. 

There are certain " high art " cookery books that are 
very good and complete, in their way ; but they are too 
elaborate and pretentious for the class for whom this was 
written. They go into the mysteries of French dishes, 
and tell how to get up grand dinners, but they leave the 
poor young wife, who wants to cook a chop or a chicken, 



VI INTRODUCTION. 

stuff a piece of veal, and make a pudding, or a loaf of 
bread for the first time in her life, quite in the dark. 

It is not claimed for the present volume, by the author, 
that it fully meets the necessities of the case, or has satis- 
factorily accomplished its task, even within the modest 
limits assigned to it. It is one thing to think how some- 
thing may be done, and another thing to do it ; but it is 
claimed that the object of the work has been constantly 
kept in view, that it has been ex;ecuted lovingly, with a 
strong appreciation of the benefit and pleasure to be de- 
rived from good cooking, from the intermingling of the 
finer with the grosser elements, with a pleasant remem- 
brance of good times spent in the kitchen, and with an 
earnest wish to make these duties seem attractive to the 
conscientious young wives who would willingly perform 
their part, if they but knew how. 

Nearly all the receipts and recommendations in the fol- 
lowing pages have been carefully tested and found sensi- 
ble and practical. We have omitted some things, which 
nearly all cook-books contain, such as directions for carv- 
ing, setting table, etc. ; because it seemed a waste of valu- 
able space. Carving is partly a gift of nature, and partly 
of grace ; it is never learned from a book. Directions of 
this kind, moreover, are useless without illustrations ; and 
these did not come within the scope of the present work. 
Information as to how to put the knives and forks on a 
dinner table is another work of supererogation. Few 
l^ersons who use a cookery book are so benighted as not 
to have seen a table neatly set sometime or other, and if 
they have, it is worth more to them than a dozen printed 
rules. Young housekeepers will, however, find a great 
many hints, — the result of experience and observation, — 
which we hope will prove useful to them, and help to keep

them from the errors and perplexities of many who have 
preceded them. 

Dear friends, — for it is you, for whom this book is writ- 
ten, and to whom it is dedicated, — I believe in you, I sym- 
pathize with you, because I am one of you. I see you in 
your lovely young wife-hood, so happy in your treasures 
of pantry and closet, so proud of your first culinary suc- 
cess, and of your lord and master's high appreciation of 
it ; and I would, if it were possible, extend the loving 
halo which glorifies every act of afiection during these 
first happy months, to all your future ; so that no weari- 
ness, no pain, no distrust^ no loss of anything that now 
makes life beautiful, might ever come near you. But 
this is out of my power. I can only wish for every one no 
more clouds than is necessary, to vary and make beautiful 
the matrimonial sky, and so dear friends, 

Farewell. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 



1. The object of cooking is to make food healthful, and palata- 
ble ; the secret is therefore, how to combine elements and flavors, 
so as to produce the best results. 

2. The best meat requires the simplest preparation. 

3. A cardinal principle in cooking is cleanliness ; a dirty cook 
cannot be a good cook, because all her dishes, no matter how dis- 
tinct in quality, or costly in material, will taste as if, to use a com- 
mon expression, they were " cooked in one pot." 

4. As a general rule, to which there are very few exceptions, 
cook long and slowly, to cook well, and let the heat reach every 
part as evenly as possible. 

5. Fresh meats, and fish are better than corned, pickled, or 
smoked provisions; and the flesh of grown animals, (beef or mut- 
ton) is to be preferred to young beasts, such as veal or lamb. 

6. The natural order in cooking meats or fish, excepting oys- 
ters, is first to broil, second to boil, third to roast, fourth to stew, 
fifth to bake, and sixth to fry ; and never to fry, as long as there is 
another method left. 

7. To retain the jucies in boiled meat, keep it in mass and plunge 
it in boiling water ; this coagulates the outer coating and prevents 
t'he escape of the jucies, or soluable matter. To extract the ju- 
cies for soup, cut it up in small pieces, and put it in cold water ; 
this draws out all the strength, making good soup, but poor meat. 

8. Air should have access to roasting meat, hence spit roasting 
before a fire, is found much better than roasting in a closed oven. 

9. Always retain as much as possible of the distinct flavor of 
every article of food used ; mixtures which make all dishes taste 
alike, are dyspepsia breeding, as well as appetite killing. 

10. Carefully avoid placing articles in contact, which have no 

!• 



2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 

affinity, such as fish and meat, etc. It is sufficient for people to 
do that in their stomachs. 

11. A light hand in making, a quick step in baking, maketh a 
good conscience for eating bread, puddings, and pies. 

12. Food for the well, is better than physic for the sick. Bad 
; cooking is a crime ; it is the cause of dyspepsia, and a host of 
'other evils. A woman convicted of it ought to be arrainged for 

manslaughter. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 



The great question when a young couple are going to be mar- 
ried is, whether they shall keep house or board. The gentleman, 
as a general rule, wishes to keep house, he is tired of boarding ; 
moreover, he had anticipated so much enjoyment in a snug little 
house oif their own, and so much pride and pleasure in seeing his 
pretty Nellie at the. head of his table, doing the honors to the 
choicest of his friends. 

But Nellie has quite different ideas ; in the first place, she 
knows nothing about cooking. She has, with the help of her 
mother, or the cook, made cake once or twice, or possibly blanc- 
mange, which was very much praised ; but of the practical details 
required in the getting up of the most ordinary breakfast, dinner, 
or supper, she knows nothing, and has not the remotest intention 
or inclination to become acquainted with them. 

The final result is, that they go to ** board" in some highly gen- 
teel estabhshment, where the prices are high in proportion to the 
gentility and lack of real comfort, and some fine morning the 
young gentleman wakes up to the knowledge that he is tied to a wife 
who doubles his expenses, but has added nothing to his happiness, 
or at any rate, nothing to the real value and usefulness of his life. 

This is a matrimonial swindle. Girls ought not to marry until 
they are ready and willing to accept the position of head of a 
household, and capable of making a home what it should be to 
husband and children. 

If a man can find a woman to act as his mistress for her board 
and clothes, well and good — there is no law to prevent it ; but for 
a woman bearing the honored name of wife to hold so dependent 
and humilating a position, is fearful degradation. 

The marriage relation is one of reciprocal interests, duties, and 
rcsponsibihties ; and no young lady ought to marry until she is 



4 HOUSEKEEPING. 

willing to assume her share of them. True affection on the part 
of the husband will lighten, and make duties pleasures, but what- 
ever aspect they bear, she must not shrink from them. If she has 
not received the training necessary to fit her for the position, it is 
her misfortune ; but it will be her fault, if she does not try as far as 
possible to remedy the evil. 

Want of means constitutes no sort of reason why young married 
people should not go to housekeeping. What we spend on fool- 
ish and useless gewgaws and presents would, in nine cases out of 
ten, if usefully applied, set them up in a style quite in accordance 
with their means, if not their inclination. 

But it is not for themselves they fear. They are willing, or at 
least they think so, to live together in an attic ; but society ! Well, 
what has society got to do with it ? Society will not pay your 
butcher's and grocer's bills, nor care a copper whether they are 
paid or not. Society will eat ice-cream, oysters, and cake of your 
providing, but that is not what you are marrying for. 

You have chosen a comparatively poor man, your business is to 
adapt yourself to his circumstances, to make the most of his means 
in providing a pleasant home, and bringing up carefully and con- 
scientiously the children which may be given you. If society find 
you out, or if you find it worth while to fill up any of the chinks 
or interstices with occasional glimpses of the false, glittering, out- 
side world — good ! you will come back to your sweet home with 
so much the more relish ; but do not marry it, do not sacrifice your 
own sense of duty, and the happiness and welfare of husband and 
flimily to it. 

Talk of happiness, — there is none like that of an intelligent, af- 
fectionate family circle. There is no pleasure, no enjoyment 
equal to that of a mother ministering to the wants, or gratifying 
the natural and innocent tastes of her children. The pleasure is all 
the greater, because it is a surprise. 

Young women very often dread the exacting «are of a family, and 
expect to find wifely and maternal duties irksome and wearisome ; 
that is the reason why they would so willingly escape them, 
as they fancy, by boarding, and not having children. 

But unfortunately, or fortunately, God has managed it so that 
we cannot take the pleasures of life without bearing its pains ; we 



HOUSEKEEPING. 5 

cannot shirk a plain line of duty, without incurring the penalty. 
But we can, and do, by taking upon ourselves bravely, its bur- 
dens, find an exaltation of womanhood, and a hight and depth of 
happiness, such as we never before dreamed of. 

Exceptions are said to exist to every general rule ; but there are 
very few to this, that when people marry, they ought to set right 
about making a home of their own. If you can only afford two 
rooms, live in two rooms. If your means will compass a small 
house, but not a large one, then take the small one, and be happy 
and thankful. 

I would not give a wisp of straw for a young woman who does 
not want, on her marriage, to occupy her own little domain ; who 
does not revel in anticipation over the contents of kitchen and 
closet, if there is only a small cook stove in one, and a set of 
delf in the other. But this suggests a matter of some importance. 



KITCHEN FURNISHING. 

In selecting a house to live in, particularly if it is a small one, 
give the preference to a pleasant, sunny kitchen, which will at 
least look clean when it is clean, and into which it will not be disa- 
greeable to enter. 

As a general rule, buy as little as possible on first going to 
housekeeping ; it is easy to add more when experience has dis- 
covered to you precisely what you want ; but if you should indulge 
in any extravagance, let it be in the kitchen furnishing. 

It is a real pleasure to get a glimpse of an orderly kitchen and 
neat closets, newly fitted up with all the useful modem contriv- 
ances for saving labor, and making it agreeable, and as the whole 
cost would not amount to more than one expensive carpet, it is 
not worth while to d,o without them. 

It is economical, moreover, to have all kitchen utensils of the 
best quality ; cheap pans, brushes, pails, earthenware and the like, 
are not only an " eyesore " in a house, and bad or disagreeable to 
use, but they are good for nothing ; they eternally want replacing, 



6 HOUSEKEEPING. 

while a really good article is not only taken better care of, but 
■will stand infinitely more of hard usage. 

Oil cloth is the best material for covering a kitchen floor ; it is 
easily kept clean, and does not absorb the dirt and grease. 

Short, white muslin curtains to kitchen windows are considered 
*' nonsense " by some people, but they are tidy, and the cost and 
washing are not much. 

: Of course the kitchen wiU be supplied with dresser, table with 
drawer, and ironing table. As to chairs, three and a common 
rocker are sufficient ; but I would enliven the walls with a picture 
or two, if possible, and encourage the cook, or maid of all work, 
to have her monthly rose or pot of geranium in the window. 

Under the shelves of the kitchen closets, it is a good plan to 
have narrow strips of board, in which nails or tacks can be in- 
serted, for the purpose of hanging up all sorts of small articles, 
such as iron and wooden spoons, sugar and flour sifters, tin strain- 
ers, lemon squeezer, lemon grater, egg beater, skewers, small 
sauce pans, cake turner, rolling pin, and such things as one is most 
likely to want, and which it is convenient to have in sight. 

The floors of all closets should be covered with oil-cloth, so that 
they can be easily washed up, and kept neat and clean. 



HOUSEHOLD ISIANAGEJ^IENT. 

Women are sometimes accused of managing too much, and 
sometimes of not managing at all ; but the most perfect system of 
management is, undoubtedly, that which outwardly betrays Itself 
least, and in the results of which, there is not suspected to have 
been any management at all. 

Regularity is the pivot upon which all household management 
turns ; where there is a lack of system there is a lack of comfort, 
that no amount of individual effort can supply. Forethought also 
is necessary, so that the work may be all arranged beforehand ; 
done in its proper order, and at the right time. Never, except 
in cases of extreme emergency, allow Monday's washing to be put 



HOUSEKEEPING. 7 

off till Tuesday ; Tuesday's ironing till Wednesday, or Wednes- 
day's finishing up and ** setting to rights," till Thursday. Leave 
Thursday for extra work ; or when that is not required, for rest- 
ing day, or half holiday, and as a preparation for the up stairs' 
sweeping and dusting of Friday, and the downstairs' baking and 
scrubbing of Saturday. 

Arrange work so as to save fuel as much as possible. Mix 
bread at night, so that it will be ready to bake with that ** first 
fire " which always makes the oven hot in the morning. Prepare 
fruit over night, so that pies or other things can be quickly made 
and baked immediately after. Prepare hashes for breakfast, over 
night. Have the kitchen and dining room put in order before re- 
tiring to rest. Have kindlings and whatever is needed for build- 
ing fires laid ready, and the fire in the kitchen raked down, so 
that it can be built up in the shortest possible space of time. This 
is not only a saving in the morning, but will be found useful in 
case of illness in the night, when a fire is often required at a mo- 
ment's notice. 

Try to buy in as large quantities as possible, so as to save the 
pei-petual running out to the grocery. Sapplies on hand also en- 
able the housekeeper to provide a more varied table, with far 
greater economy than is possible where every thing is bought by 
the half a pound, more or less. 

Every family that can possibly find means to do it, or a place 
to properly keep the articles, should commence winter with fuel, 
potatoes, apples, flour, and butter, enough to last till Spring. A 
good supply of hominy, rice, farina, Indian meal, preserved fish, 
and other staples, including sugar, should also be laid in, not for- 
getting a box of raisins, one of currants, a third of soap, and a 
fourth of starch. 

There is such an immense saving in soap well dried, that it is 
surprising so many housekeepers content themselves with buy- 
ing it in damp bars. Starch also is frightfully wasted by quarter, 
and half pound purchases, which are frequently all absorbed at one 
time, by careless girls, in doing the washing for a small family. 

But in most American families, the largest amount of waste, 
probably, takes place in the use of fuel. Heretofore, fuel of all 
kinds has been comparatively cheap, and very little supervision has 



8 HOUSEKEEPING. 

been exercised over its use. At present rates however, it is an 
item of considerable importance ; and it is quite time that servants 
were taught how to employ it to the best advantage. 

In nine out of ten kitchens, when there is any cooking to be done 
the range is made red hot ; when the cooking is done, the fire is 
left to go down to ashes, and is then raised by means of a wasteful 
pile of kindhng wood. When no cooking is going on, and a large 
tire is not needed, the dampers will frequently be left open, and 
the fuel allowed to blaze itself out up the chimney instead of being 
kept in reserve for actual service. 

The general principle of construction upon which American 
kitchen stoves and ranges is based, renders them either very eco- 
nomical, or very much otherwise, according to the way they are man- 
aged. After the fire is first built in an ordinary stove, or range, the 
dampers ought all to be closed up and not opened again during the 
day, except while broiling, or something of that sort. If the grate 
is kept clear, and the fire replenished with a small quantity of coal, 
before it begins to getlow, both the oven, and the top of the range 
will be kept sufliciently hot for any kind of cooking, and it will be 
done all the better for being done somewhat more slowly, than is 
customary with the well meaning, but terribly blundering, and 
irresponsible race of wild Irish girls, who ofiiciate as the high 
priestesses of our domestic altars. 

The strictest attention on the part of a house-keeper, is necessa- 
ry, to see that certain articles are kept for their proper use ; for 
instance, that the dish cloth is not used for a floor cloth, that the 
napkins are not used to wipe up the dishes, the dish towels as 
dusters, a new broom to sweep out the back yard, and the best new 
enamelled sauce pan, for melting down grease. 

Where the lady of the house attends partly to her own work, 
she will naturally see to all these things : but where it is left wholly 
to servants, there are always complaints of missing articles, and an 
inspection of the kitchen, or ironing table drawer, would generally 
bring them all to light, although in a state almost unrecognizable, 
from dirt, and their contiguity to whitening, hair oil, candle grease, 
combs and brushes, and other articles, all of which it is found 
♦' handy " to keep in a drawer in the kitchen, with mats, table cloths, 
towels, and other things destined for family use. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 9 

It is hardly necessary after this to say that a kitchen being once 
provided with necessary and convenient articles for cleaning and 
cooking, the presiding genius should be held to a strict accounta- 
bility for them. Pudding cloths should be forthcoming whenever 
wanted, — dry, clean, and free from stains ; towels, napkins, pans, 
bowls, and cooking utensils, should be kept strictly to their uses, 
and not put away till perfectly clean and dry. 

Ironing sheets, blankets, skirt board, bosom board, iron holder, 
rubber, and the like, should be kept smoothly folded in the drawer 
of the ironing table, when not in use. 

The shelves of kitchen, dining-room, and other closets, should 
be covered with fresh paper, neatly cut out on the edges, once in 
two weeks, and dusted down twice a week. 

Pot closets, safes, and refrigerators, should be thoroughly scrub- 
bed out every week, and the latter aired every day. 

Good brooms and brushes will last a long time if care is taken 
of them. When first bought they should be allowed to stand in 
cold water for twelve hours, and then thoroughly dried before using 
When not in use, they should be hung up by a loop of twine, or 
cord, so that the weight may not rest on the edge of the splinters, 
and break them. Four large brooms should be provided, one for 
the kitchen, one for the parlor, one for the sleeping rooms, and one 
for the family, or "living" room. A "whisk" will be required 
for every room in the house, besides one for the hall. 

As soon as the kitchen broom is worn down so as to render it 
unfit to sweep the floor with ease and comfort, take it for the cel- 
lar, door steps, and back yard ; take the one from the sitting room 
for the kitchen, the one from the parlor to the sitting room, and 
get a new one for the parlor. 

Exact punctuality in serving the meals, and punctual attendance 
at them ; it is oftener the fault of the family, than the servants, that 
meals are served at irregular hours. Where the members make a 
practice of sitting down any time, and food is kept waiting until 
it suits their pleasure or convenience to partake of it, irrespect- 
ive of household necessities, servants, or any one else, will nat- 
urally become cai-clcss and neglectful. 

HOUSEHOLD MEMORANDA. 

Dried herbs should be tied each separately in a paper bag, and 



10 HOUSEKEEPING. 

hung against the wall in the store-room. Mint, pennyroyal, cat- 
nip, sage, thyme, summer-savory and parsley, are all good to 
have in the house. 

Parsley should be bunched before it goes to seed, and hung up 
to dry. In a week, or two, it may be put in paper bags, and is 
ready for use, for soup, stuffing, or fricassee. 

PIECE BAGS. 

Out of an old calico dress make three piece bags, and label each 
one of them with its written name upon a small square piece of 
white muslin, which must be sewn upon the side of the bag. One 
should be the " rag-bag," another the *' white piece-bag," a third, 
the " colored piece-bag," — they will be found very useful. 

DUSTERS 

Provide a duster, as well as a feather brush, and a whisk broom, 
for every room in the house, and see that they are kept in their 
place, when not in use. 

KITCHEN HOLDERS. 

Make three kitchen holders, one to put away with the ironing 
apparatus, two others, to be hung up, one each side, under the 
kitchen mantle piece, so as to be ready for lifting pots and kettles 
off the fire, or taking hold of the hot handle of a sauce pan, or 
skillet. Small squares of old, or new carpet, are best, with an 
inner lining of old cloth, and an outer one of dark twilled cotton, 
which may either be sewed to the edge of the carpet, or the whole 
may be bound with worsted binding. Add a loop to hang it up by. 

PAPER AND STRING. 

When parcels are brought to the house, take the nice white, or 
brown tissue paper, in which the goods have been wrapped, fold it 
and put it away in a drawer, with the string tied round it, to be 
ready for use in case of emergency. 

MENDING 

When you put the clean clothes away for the family, examine 
every piece, and see if a string, or a button needs replacing, or 



HOUSEKEEPING. 11 

a fracture requires mending. Pile all together, and repair them at 
once, remembering that a stitch in time saves nine. 

MENDING STOCKINGS. 

Mending stockings for a large family, is a somewhat onerous, 
and not altogether agreeable duty. As soon as the daughters are old 
enough they should be set to mending their own ; but even then, 
there is sometimes a large pile for " mother's" work basket. Do 
not hurry them ; however, mend them conscientiously, if it is only one 
pair at a time. Have needle and darning cotton of the proper size, 
take a large area In every direction beyond the hole, leave loops at 
each end of the thread, as it is drawn out, for shrinkage — and darn 
carefully and extensively over all the thin places. Hose mended 
in this way will not require the process more than twice, during 
their existence, provided the quality in the first place was the best. 
Cheap hose are not worth buying at all. 

R^ilNY DAYS. 

Make the house look as bright as possible inside, have some- 
thing good for tea, put on a pretty dress, light up early, romp 
with the children, tell them stories, and determine at least to have 
sunshine in the house, if you cannot have it outside. 

PACKING AWAY SUIVEVIER OR WINTER CLOTHES. 

Before packing away summer or winter clothes, devote a day to 
an examination of them ; mend, and clean any spots off that may 
require it, brush, and shake them well, fold up smoothly, and 
sprinkle between every fold a little gum camphor, unless you are 
so fortunate as to have cedar chests, and then you will not need It. 
Sprinkle a little gum camphor also on the bottom of common trunks 
or chests, pack closely, filling up all the crevices, with small arti- 
cles such as stockings, gloves, scarfs, hoods and the like, reserv- 
ing the body part of the box for the larger garments. 

Nice dresses, velvet cloaks, opera cloaks, furs, and the like, 
should be folded in sheets, or towels, pinned tightly down, and be 
placed in the trays, or hollow part of trunks, by themselves, if 
possible. 



12 HOUSEKEEPING. 

CAKE BOX. 

Have a japanned box, or large jar, for cake, 'which will shut 
down tight. Cover it with a linen cloth, which should be put in 
the wash once in two weeks. Empty the box, scald it out, and let 
it dry in the sun, or before the fire, every week. 

CHAMBER, MAKTEL, AND TOILET COVERS. 

White Marseilles, thinj9ig'M€ or Allendale quilting, edged with 
white ball, or twisted fringe, makes nice covers for toilet stands, 
or chamber mantels, especially where cottage furniture is used. If 
the furniture is very handsome black walnut, or rosewood, ele- 
gant mantel covers may be made, by tacking patent maropn vel- 
vet on a thin board, and edging it with bullion fringe. 

TO CLEAN LOOKING GLASSES. 

Divide a newspaper in two halves, fold up one in a small square 
and dip it in cold water. Kub the glass first with the wet half of 
the paper, and dry with the other. Fly specks, and all other 
dirty marks will disappear as if by magic. 

TO TAKE OUT SCORCH. 

If a shirt bosom, or any other article has unfortunately been 
scorched in ironing, lay it where bright sunshine will fall straight 
upon it. It will take it entirely out, leaving it clean and white as 
snow. 

LABEL CHILDREN. 

Into the crowns of the hats or bonnets of little children, sew a 
square of writing paper, stating age, and residence. This will 
save them from any danger of being lost. 

WASH RAGS. 

Small squares of crash hemmed, make very nice wash rags, or 
small, coarse tea napkins, fringed on the sides ; very good ones 
may also be made out of the best part of old dinner napkins, or 
tablecloths. Be careful always to supply them to every sleeping- 
room with the towels, and see that they are changed once a week. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 13 



NIGHT CLOTHES. 

Kever wear anything at night that you have worn during the 
day, nor during the day, that you have worn at night. 

TO PUT OUT FIRE. 

In all such cases, great promptitude and quickness is necessary. 
The thing to be done is, to ci-ush it out ; either with rugs, mats, 
blankets, or whatever else is handy. 

If the fire is in a chimney, fire a pistol into it, or put salt on it, and 
close up the draft of the fire-place, by pinning a quilt up over it. 
This last precaution alone will generally prevent danger, unless 
there should happen to be a high wind. 

SHEETS. 

When sheets are beginning to wear in the middle, sew the sel- 
vage sides together, tear them in two, and hem down the sides ; 
they will last enough longer to pay for the trouble, especially at 
present price of muslin. 

PAY AS YOU GO. 

Keep no books, and never run accounts with stores ; pay for 
what you buy lohen you buy it, and so save much money and trouble 
and prevent many very disagreeable mistakes. 

HOW TO CLEAR A TABLE. 

Collect all the food together first, and dispose of it, neatly, 
and carefully. Put all the spoons together, all the forks together, 
and all the knives together. If you have a small pitcher partly 
full of warm water on the table, put the knives into that, blades 
down. Scrape the plates clean, and empty all the slops from the 
tea and coffee cups, into the slop bowl. Have ready your clean 
light wooden tub, two thirds full of hot water, little mop, piece of 
soap, and tin pan of warm water for rinsing. "Wash the glasses 
first, with a little soap, and rinse them, then the spoons, then the 
cups and saucers, then the silver forks, then the plates, lastly, the 
larger dishes. Dry quickly with nice large fine linen crash towels. 
Be careful not to put the handle of knives into hot water, or silver 



14 HOXTSEKEEPING. 

knives where tbey can touch the forks, as that will scratch them. 
The quicker the whole operation is performed, the brighter and 
nicer the ware will be. 

MATTRESSES. 

Mattresses are used universally now in preference to feather 
beds ; and to save trouble, some people straighten the clothes over 
them, just as they rise. This is very bad, they ought to be turned 
every day, and exposed to the air some time before the bed is made 
up. 



HINTS ON ECONOIklY. 

Provide on Saturday for Monday, so as not to take up the fire 
with cooking, or time in running errands, any more than is possi- 
ble on washing day. 

Wait till articles, fruit, fish, poultry and vegetables, are in 
full season, before purchasing. They are then not only much 
lower in price than when first brought to market, but finer in 
quality and flavor. 

Outside garments, bonnets, cloaks, hats, shawls, scarfs and 
the like, will last clean and fresh much longer, if the dust is care- 
fully removed from them by brushing and shaking after returning 
from a ride or a walk. 

When your apples begin to rot, pick the specked ones out 
carefully ; stew them up with cider and sugar, and fill all your 
empty self-sealing cans. In this way you may keep in nice apple 
sauce till apples come again. 

Pickle or preserve jars should be washed in lukewarm 
or cold water, and dried in the sun or near the fire. Hot water 
cracks the polished surface of the inside, and renders them unfit 
for their specific use. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 15 

Never allow children to eat butter with meat or gravy ; it 
is both wasteful and injurious. 

Hot bucksvheat c.vkes will go farther and last longer than 
any other single article of food. A celebrated judge declared that 
he could remain in court all day, without feeling a symptom of 
hunger, after a breakfast of buckwheat cakes. 

A stew is not a bad dish for a family dinner, once a week ; 
make it of good meat, and savory with sweet herbs, and the most 
fastidious will not object to it. 

Rise early on fine summer mornings, and throw all the win- 
dows of the house open, so that it may exchange its close atmos- 
phere, for the cool, fresh air. Have the work done before the 
heat of the day comes on, and save it as much as possible during 
the warmest weather. 

Take care of the food that is brought into the house, and 
see that none of it is wasted ; but do not be always on the lookout 
for cheap things. Beans are cheap, and very good sometimes ; 
corn meal is cheap too, and even more available, because it can be 
made into a great variety of dishes, but people would not care to 
live on beans and corn meal all the time, because they are cheap. 
Eating is intended as a means of enjoyment, as well as of sustain- 
ing life ; and it is right to avail ourselves of the abundant re- 
sources provided, as far as we can consistently. 

Use tea leaves, or short, freshly cut grass, to sprinkle upon 
carpets before sweeping. It will freshen up the colors, and save 
the usual cloud of dust. 

Have ea'tirything clean, on Saturday night, something nice 
for tea, and also for Sunday morning breakfast. Let the ap- 
proach of the Sabbath be anticipated in all things, with pleasure. 
Stay at home with the children on Sabbath evening, and finish the 
day with a sacred concert. 



16 HOUSEKEEPING. 

Allow no holes, or corners in the house, in drawers, on 
shelves, or in closets, for the stowing away of dirty rags, old bot- 
tles, grease-pots, and broken crockery. When bottles are emp- 
tied, let them be cleaned, and put down in the cellar, until they 
are wanted. Harbor no dirty grease pots, and when an article is 
broken past recovery, throw it away at once ; there is no use in 
keeping it to collect dust, and cobwebs. 

Make a POiNXof examining safe, refrigerator, closets, drawers, 
and all receptacles for food, and kitchen articles, at least as often 
as once a week, either Saturday, or washing day. Look into pickle 
jars, bread jars, cake jars, butter tubs, apple, and potato bar- 
rels, everything in fact, examine their condition, see if they are 
kept covered and clean, and that food put away, is not left to 
spoil, or be wasted. 

The fewer servants the better — two requires a third to 
wait upon them, and so on ad infinitum. Have good servants how- 
ever, pay good wages, and make them responsible for their work. 

If it is possible, and when there is a will there is a way, call 
your household together, after breakfast every morning, and have 
domestic worship, be it ever so short. A verse of a hymn, a pas- 
sage from the Bible, and just a few words of heartfelt prayer, and 
praise, sets everything right for the day, smooths ruffled tempers, 
and puts the domestic machine in nicely running order. It is also 
no bad preparation for the temptations and annoyances of busi- 
ness. 

Before sweeping a room, have the furniture, and especially all 
the small articles, dusted and removed. This keeps them look- 
ing fresh, and new. 

Wear pretty morning dresses ; they are inexpensive, and 
easily preserved from injury, by a large calico apron enveloping the 
skirt of the dress, and sleeves of the same kind, gathered into a 
band, top, and bottom, and extending over the elbows. These can 
be slipped on and off in a minute, and with a bib added to the 



HOUSEKEEPING. 17 

apron in front, affords complete protection, while engaged in dust- 
ing, making pastry, and the like. 

Always have your table served neatly, and then If friends 
""^ happen in," you will not be ashamed to ask them to share your 
meal. Be hospitable, if it is only a crust, and a cup of cold 
water ; if it is clean and good of its kind, there is no reason to 
lilush for It ; the hearty welcome will make amends for the absence 
of rich viands. 

If children want anything between meals, which they should 
not, give them a cracker, or an apple ; do not encourage an irreg_ 
ular and unhealthy appetite, by giving them pie, cake, or ginger- 
"bread. 



RULES FOR EATING 

1. Eat slowly as if it was a pleasure you desired to prolong, 
rather than a duty to be got rid of as quickly as possible. 

2. Don't bring your prejudices, your dislikes, your annoyances, 
your past misfortunes, or future forebodings, to the table — they 
■would spoil the best dinner. 

3. Respect the hours of meals, you have no right to injure the 
temper of the cook, destroy the flavor of the viands, and the com- 
fort of the family, by your want of punctuality. 

4. Have as much variety in your food as possible, but not many 
dishes served at one time. 

5. Find as httle fault with the food prepared as possible, and 
praise whenever you can. 

6. Finally, be thankful; if you have not meat, that you have 
at least an appetite, and hope for something more and better in 
the future. 



THE USE OF FUEL. 

There is no department of housekeeping in which our national 
spirit of waste and extravagance is more clearly exemplified, than 



18 HOUSEKEEPING. 

ill our use of fuel. Even the enormous advance in prices has 1«S 
to no retrenchment or reform in this respect. Coal and wood are 
just as recklessly as ever, shovelled into the cellar. Bridget makes 
the same blazing fires, subject to no supervision, except a faint, 
general direction, to " sift the cinders every morning ; " and Bridg- 
et says " yes'm " as usual, but there being nobody to see, or know 
whether she does or not, in nineteen cases out of twenty, she does 
not do it. 

Every little while through the day, the fires are raked down, and 
fresh coal put on, the dampers of stove or range left wide open, 
and for so much cooking as a cup of tea, or a dish of potatoes, a 
fresh fire built with range made red hot, and as much fuel wasted 
as would have cooked a thanksgiving dinner. 

GRATE FIRES. 

These are generally considered as requiring a great deal of coal, 
and so they do, under the usual system of management in this coun- 
try. But let us see how they manage grate fires in England. 

The grate is cleared, with the exception of a few scattering cin- 
ders, which forms a sort of body, for the paper, which is torn up in 
small pieces, and crushed down, and the wood, which is neatly and 
compactly laid " across and across." When the largest and 
best cinders remaining are picked out and thrown on, a match is 
applied, cinders are still put on wherever they are needed to catch 
the blaze, and when the wood is burnt down, and the cinders are 
all a-glow, fresh coal is used to fill up the grate. The ashes are 
then sifted, the cinders, which are fine and small, damped, and 
when the fire has burned red through, without the use of the blower, 
the wet cinders are thrown on the top. In this way a grate fire 
will last through a whole day with once replenishing, and keep a 
room warmer than we do, without blaze, our frequent use of the 
blower, and reckless waste of fuel. 

KITCHEN R.iNGES. 

Nearly all of these are built on the air tight principle, and 
should be kept closed up tight all the time. The fire will be found 
to burn equally well, though more moderately ; the oven will be 
always hot, and cooking can be done slowly, as it ought, on the 



HOUSEKEEPING. 19 

top of the range, with much less trouble, and infinitely better than 
if " rushed through," at a red heat. 

PARLOR HEATERS. 

These new heaters are very good for small houses ; we used one 
for years, with great satisfaction, and found it quite as efficient, 
and much safer, more convenient and more economical than a fur- 
nace. 

Parlor heaters are fitted into the wall, and take up no more 
room than a grate ; they should be attended to with regularity, and 
then the fire will hardly ever need to go out ; once in two months 
is quite as often as it requires to be made up fresh. At night, 
wetted cinders should be thrown on the fire so as to thickly cover 
it while it is good, and the dampers shut up close ; these will 
keep the fire almost intact till the next morning, when a thorough 
raking down will be needed. A parlor heater properly managed, 
burns out about as much coal as one large grate or two small 
stoves ; but excepting in the very coldest weather, it will comfort- 
ably heat the whole house. 

SPRING FUEL. 

Coke is excellent fuel for spring and fall, if it is carefully and 
rightly used ; but if it is mixed with hard coal and thrown on a 
kitchen fire by a reckless servant, at discretion, it becomes equally 
extravagant and useless. Coke makes a bright, hot fire, kindles 
easily, and goes out easily ; but it can also be made to last a long 
while, by packing it a little on top, and neglecting to rake it down. 
This is the method for early spring, when fires are required in the 
morning and evening, but not much through the sunshiny part of 
the day. 

A great saving is effected in spring fuel, by putting the " slack " 
from coal, in a heap by itself, and with it, ashes from which the cin- 
ders have not been taken. Dampen the heap occasionally with a 
little water, and add to it, whenever there is material. Doing this 
through the coldest weather will form a sort of compost, hard and 
insoluble, Avhich can be broken apart, and furnishes splendid fuel 
for spring grate fires, or for parlor heaters 



SOUPS. 



STOCKS. 

Stock is the foundation of soups, and also of good gravies, 
sauces, and the like. A French cook can do nothing without the 
stock pot, and keeps it supplied in a way that is both useful, and 
economical. 

Stock can be made to keep for a considerable time, and be used 
for many purposes, if occasional additions are made, and the whole 
of the liquor re-scalded. It may be made from meat, or from bones, 
or from both, or it may be made from bones with the addition of 
refuse meat, the trimmings of regular joints. Chicken and turkey 
bones may be thrown in, and will help to enrich, and give flavor to 
the preparation. Any kind of bones with a little meat upon them, 
will make good stock, if they are simmered, not boiled, long enough, 
and beef, mutton, veal, poultry, and other bones may be stewed to- 
gether. In stewing them down, use the liquor if you have it, in 
which other meat has been boiled, so that nothing may be wasted. 
Shank bones, trimmings from chops, any thing of this sort may be 
thrown in, simmered all day, then poured into a jar, and the fat 
removed the next morning. It is then frequently a jelly, and ready 
to convert into soup, with the aid of herbs, and vegetables — or kept 
for other uses. Stock sours very soon after the vegetables have 
been boiled in it, so it is best not to put the vegetables in till need- 
ed for soup. 

If your stock is made of meat, or partly of meat, cut it up fine, 
and always put it on in cold water, if the water is hard, put a pinch 
of soda in it. This will extract all the pieces of the bones and 
meat. If on the contrary, you want to boil meat, and retain 
its pieces, put it on in boiling water. [See the Principles of Cook- 
ing-] 



SOUPS. 21 



STOCK FROM BONES. 

Take the bones of a sirloin of beef, break them into half a 
dozen pieces or more, put them in the stock pot with a gallon of 
cold water ; and let them simmer gently for five or six hours. Then 
take it off, strain it — it ought to make about two quarts — and set it 
aside for several hours, or over night. When cold, skim off the 
fat. Then return it to the pot with a turnip, and a large carrot cut 
up in two or three pieces, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, a 
sprig or two of parsley, and a head of celery if it can be obtained, or 
a teaspoonful of celery-seed tied in a piece of muslin. Let these 
simmer together gently for two hours, adding boiling water to keep 
the quantity two quarts, and putting in also while boiling a little 
salt and a large lump of sugar ; when done, strain it off into a 
jar, and you have a good stock, which can be kept several days, 
in a cool place in winter, or by being boiled over each day, in 
summer. 

STOCK WITHOUT MEAT. 

Put into a stew pan ten carrots, as many turnips and onions 
cut in small pieces, two lettuces, two sticks of celery, a handful 
of chervil, half a cabbage and a parsnip cut in slices ; add to these 
three ounces of butter and a quart of water ; stew them till the 
liquid is nearly dried up, and then fill the stewpan with water ; 
add a quart of peas, green or dried, according to the season, two 
chives, some pepper and salt ; stew slowly three or four hours and 
strain through a colander for use. 

BRAN STOCK. 

Put a large handful of bran into a quart of water, boil and leave 
to simmer till the quantity is reduced to half. This will do excel- 
lently for the thickening of meat soup. It will make very good 
soup of itself, if onions, salt and pepper, with a few vegetables, are 
mixed in it. It will also be good sweetened with molasses or 
honey. 

cow HEEL STOCK. 

A COW heel in two quarts of water will make first rate stock, but 



ZZ SOUPS. 

do not get boiled cow heels. The others take more boiling, but 
make much richer stock, and may be used more than once. 

FOUR QUARTS OF BROWN STOCK. 

Heat an iron pot and rub the bottom with garlic. Put in ten 
pounds of shin of beef, fresh killed, and a pint of water ; let it 
stand by the fire for an hour, then add three quarters of a pound 
of lean ham, three onions, three carrots, a small head of celery, 
four cloves, six allspice, ten peppercorns, a table-spoonful of brown 
sugar, a tea-spoonful of mustard, a tea-spoonful of salt, a large 
black onion, and six quarts of water. Simmer and skim frequent- 
ly for six hours. Strain into an earthen dish, and when cold, re- 
move the fat ; a fine hair sieve dipped in cold water is good to 
strain it with. 

FOUR QUARTS OF WHITE STOCK. 

Put into an iron pot a knuckle of veal, about seven pounds, a 
cowheel, and an old fowl ; add a turnip, two onions, a lettuce, a 
blade of mace, quarter of a nutmeg, half a pound of lean ham, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and six quarts 
of water. Simmer gently, and skim frequently, for six hours. 
Strain into an earthen dish, and when cold, take off the fat. 

COMMON SOUP. 

Take the neck, shanks, scraps of fresh meat, or old fowls. Let 
your meat, beef, mutton, fowls, or game, be cut into small pieces, 
and the bones cracked up well. Put the pieces into a pot and 
cover them with as nmch water as will stew them into rags ; stew 
them very slowly, then pour in some boiling water, and keep the 
soup boiUng to within a few minutes of serving. Skim it entirely 
free from grease. Take out whatever you wish to set away for 
the next day before you put in the vegetables. Now cut up vege- 
tables (previously cooked by themselves), in it slice potatoes, okra, 
turnips, carrots, any vegetable you like, or rice or barley. If there 
is any vegetable, — for instance, onions, cabbage, or tomatoes, — 
which you wish to give distinctive character to your soup, use that 
vegetable entirely, in connection with potatoes and okra, which give 
consistency without any very discernible taste. If your soup lacks 



SOUPS. 23 

richness, a few spoonfuls of drawn butter will help ; if consistency, 
some gelatine may be dissolved in it. A bouquet of sweet herbs is 
indispensable. A rich soup is sometimes flavored with wine or 
catsup. It is as well to offer these articles to each person, as also 
the castor at the table. Vermicelli or macaroni may be used as a 
substitute for okra. 

SOUP OR STOCK FROM ONE POUND OF BEEF. 

Take one pound of lean beef, free from fat, mince it finely and 
add to it its own weight of cold water ; heat it very slowly to boil- 
ing, two or three hours is not too much, let it boil briskly a minute or 
two, strain it through a towel. Mix the liquid with salt and other 
seasoning, tinge it darker with roast onions or burnt sugar. Dr. 
Liebig says this forms the best soup that can be prepared Irom one 
pound of flesh. 

FISH SOUPS. 

A variety of good soups can be made of fish by stewing them 
down in the same manner as meat, with the same addition of vege- 
tables and herbs. If the skin is coarse, strip it off before using 
the fish, and when stewing skim off the oily particles. 

WINTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of beef, boil it in two gallons of water down to one 
gallon ; pour it out after removing the bones, and let it cool. This 
will be one mass of jelly, from which as much can be taken daily 
as may be needed in the quantity of soup desired. Stew the veg- 
etables or cook the rice, split peas, beans, and add all together with 
as much water as may be necessary, and let it boil well. 

SORREL SOUP WITHOUT IMEAT. 

Wash a handful of sorrel, add some chervil, lettuce, and leeks ; 
chop all very fine, and stew with salt and butter ; when the vegeta- 
bles are done enough, add some stock without meat or water. Let 
it stew again, and before you serve, add the yolks of three or four 
eggs well beaten, with some cream or good milk, taking care it does 
not boil afler the eggs are added. Season to taste. Sorrel is pre- 
pared for winter in jars, first chopped, then pounded and season- 
ed. It must be closoly covered. 



24 HOUSEKEKPIKG. 



RABBIT SOUP. 



Cut up your rabbit and put it into a soup-pot, with a ham bone, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, a bay leaf, an onion stuck with cloves, 
some whole pepper, and let it simmer till the meat is tender, then 
cut off the meat into neat squares, return the bones and trimmings 
into the soup, and let it simmer till the meat is in rags ; then 
strain it, and thicken it with flour and butter, mixed on the fire, 
without being browned ; add a pint of highly seasoned stock, or 
if desired a pint of red wine — port is best — season to taste and let 
all simmer together with the meat that was cut off. Serve hot. 

SPRING SOUP. 

Cut an equal quantity of carrots, turnips, onions and leeks ; 
stew them in some good stock; then add some French beans, 
peas, bean cucumbers, asparagus tops, lettuces, sorrel and chervil; 
add a little bit of white sugar ; let these reduce to nearly a glaze ; 
then add them to some stock thickened with green peas rubbed 
through a tammy. The soup might be thickened, to vary it, with 
asparagus rubbed through a tammy ; in this case all the vegetables 
should be strained off, and some asparagus tops served only in the 
soup. 

SOUP FOR INVALIDS. 

Boil two pounds of lean veal and a quarter of a pound of pearl 
barley in a quart of water very slowly, until it becomes of the 
consistency of cream. Pass it through a fine sieve and salt it to 
taste. Flavor it with celery seed, if the taste be liked, or use 
fresh celery, if in season, — a very small quantity would suffice. 
It should simmer very slowly. This soup is very nourishing. 

GUMBO. 

Take a large fowl, cut in pieces, beat up and fry very brown, 
and make with it a highly seasoned and rich gravy. Cut into it a 
half gallon of tender green okra, as many ripe tomatoes, and 
pour on three pints of boiling water ; boil until the vegetables are 
of the softest consistency, and chicken in rags. Stir in a heaping 
tablespoon of young sassafras leaves, dried and reduced to a 



SOUPS. 25 

powder. Strain into your dish hot. When well made this will 
almost rope like candy* Pepper, onions, and sweet herbs are 
used profusely in this soup, with salt to savor it. 

WHITE SOUP. 

Put four or five turnips, four leeks, two heads of celery, wash- 
ed and sliced, into the saucepan with a piece of butter and a 
knuckle of ham ; add a quart of stock, and let all stew together till 
tender. "When nearly done, put in a pint of milk and some small 
pieces of bread ; boil up two or three times, strain it and serve it 
hot. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

Parboil a calf 's head divided, and cut all the meat in small pieces ; 
then break the bones and boil them in some beef broth ; fry some 
shalots in butter, add flour to thicken, and stir it in ; skim it care- 
fhlly while it boils up, and add a pint of white wine ; let it simmer 
till the meat is perfectly tender, then put in some chives, parsley, 
basil, salt, cayenne, soy, and mushroom catsup to your taste, and 
boil it in for ten minutes ; squeeze a little lemon juice into your 
tureen, pour your soup on it, and serve with force meat balls. 

sheep's-head soup. 

Cut the liver and lights into pieces, and stew them in four quarts 
of water, with some onions, carrots, and turnips, half pound of 
pearl barley, pepper, salt, cloves, and a little marjoram, parsley 
and thyme. Stew all these until nearly done enough, then put in 
the head and boil it until quite tender, then it should be taken 
out and everj'thing strained from the liquor. Let this stand till 
cool, then take off the fat, and thicken it with butter and flour 
in the same way as mock turtle. A glass of wine may be put into 
the tureen if desired, before pouring in the soup. 

CONCORD SOUP. 

Three pounds of neck of beef, one cowheel, one pennj'worth of 
carrots and turnips, part of ahead of celery, one bunch of tied up 
sweet herbs, four onions browned, one pint of peas, all put to- 
2 



26 HOUSEKEEPING. 

gethcr into three quarts of water. After boiling for some hours, 
to be well strained before serving up 

calf's head soup browned. 

Strain the liquor the head was boiled in, and set it away until 
next day ; take off all the fat ; fry an onion in a little butter in 
the soup pot, dredge in a little flour, stir until brown ; cut up two 
carrots, two onions, two turnips, and whatever is left of the head, 
in inch pieces, put them in with the stock, a dozen cloves, pepper 
and salt ; boil it about two hours ; braid up a httle flour and but- 
ter, stir it into the soup, and boil about ten minutes ; add, if de- 
sired, half a tumbler of red wine ; serve hot. 

BROWN GRAVY SOUP. 

Cut a few onions in pieces, fry them in dripping brown ; cut 
three pounds of beef in pieces, brown this also, stirring and turn- 
ing both meat and onions as they fry, then put them in the sauce- 
pan with a carrot, a turnip cut small, and a little celery if you 
have it, or two seeds of celery, add three quarts of water to this, 
stir all together with a little pepper and salt ; simmer very slowly 
and skim off what rises ; in three or four hours the soup will be 
clear. When served, add a little vermicelli, which should have 
previously been boiled in water ; the liquor should be carefully 
poured off through a sieve. 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

Take two large old fat chickens ; chop up the pieces and mash the 
bones. Put in a few slices of boiled ham if not too strong. Stew 
slowly until in rags. Then pour on three quarts of boiling water, 
and boil it down to half a gallon. Chop up the chickens' hearts, 
the yolks of four hard boiled eggs, and stir, with a tea cup half full 
of grated bread crumbs, into a cup of rich sweet cream ; strain the 
soup, return it to the kettle with a bouquet of herbs, boil five min- 
utes, stir in the cream, etc., and take it off quickly. Any soup of 
fowl or game may be made in the same way. Instead of the 
thickening prepared as above, you may boil in it some rice, or 
use vermicelli, or macaroni, previously simmered until soft. 



SOUPS. 27 



OYSTER SOUP. — 1. 

Take a shin of veal, put it in a pot with three quarts of water, 
and a head of celery, pepper, and salt ; boil it three hours ; then 
strain it all through a sieve ; add a small piece of butter, braided 
in a table-spoonful of flour ; stir it in and give it one boil ; have 
ready, washed out of the liquor, one gallon of oysters ; strain the 
liquor into the soup, let it boil up, then put in the oysters with a 
spoonful of mushroon sauce ; give it one boil and send it to the 
table very hot. 

OYSTER SOUP. — 2. 

Slice some onions, fry them a light brown in a quarter of a 
pound of butter, then put them on the fire to stew in some stock, 
as much as required for your soup, — about half an hour is suf- 
ficient; before you serve, add two or three dozen of oysters, with 
their liquor strained. Thicken with the yolks of three eggs, and 
season it with white pepper, mace, and salt; it must not boil 
after the eggs are put in, but thicken like custard. Any kind of 
good broth or stock makes the foundation. Some add to this be- 
fore the eggs are put in, a glass of white wine. 

OYSTER SOUP. — 3. 

Mix one pint of water with whatever liquor you can drain from 
two quarts of fresh oysters. When this liquor comes to a full 
boil, put the oysters in, and boil until nearly done ; then pour in 
a quart of fresh milk. Season with salt, pepper, and a blade of 
mace. If you prefer the soup a little thick, powder a half dozen 
crackers fine, and sift them into it. 

OYSTER MOUTH SOUP. 

First make a rich mutton broth, pour it on the oysters. Add 
a small piece of butter rolled in flour, let it simmer gently for about 
quarter of an hour, then serve it in a dish with crackers in the bot- 
tom. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP WITH GREEN PEAS.

Take some young carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and cabbage 
lettuces ; cut them in slices, and put them into a stewpan with a 
little butter, and some lean ham cut in pieces. Cover them close- 
ly and let them stew for a short time. Fill up with stock sufficient 
for the soup required, and let it boil until the vegetables are quite 
soft, adding a few leaves of mint and the crust of a roll ; pound 
all, and having boiled a quart of peas, as green as you can, strain 
them off and pound them also ; mix them with the rpst of the in- 
gredients and pass through a sieve. Heat it, and season with salt, 
pepper and sugar; add a few young boiled peas, and use the 
spinach to restore it. 

PEA SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

Boil a pint of split peas in two quarts of water for four or five 
hours, or until quite tender. Then add two turnips, two carrots, a 
stick of celery, and some potatoes all cut in pieces. When tender, 
pulp it through a sieve. Cut a large onion in slices and fry it in 
butter and flour, to thicken the soup. Season to taste. If desired, 
a ham bone or a piece of beef can be stewed with the peas, to be 
taken out when the soup is pulped through the sieve. Serve with 
the soup pieces of bread fried crisp in butter. 

ENGLISH PEA SOUP. 

Take a half of a shin of beef, some beef and ham bones, and, 
if possible, a knuckle of veal, and boil all together, in a gal- 
lon of water, with a little salt. Clear it of the scum, as it rises, 
and have ready a quart of split peas, which have been soaked in 
cold water over night. Boil the meat very slowly, for two hours, 
then put in the peas, which will have absorbed the water, with a 
root of celery, and two or three carrots scraped, and cut in pieces. 
Sift in, also, a little dried mint, and season to taste. Cook slow- 
ly, stirring often with a wooden spoon, for four hours. 



SOUPS. 29 



AKTICHOKE SOUP. 



Have a knuckle of veal (weighing about five pounds) for din- 
ner. When all have dined, return the bones into the stewpan, 
with the liquor in which it was boiled, a nice, white onion, and 
two turnips. Boil some Jerusalem artichokes in milk, (skim milk 
will do,) then beat up all with the liquor, which, of course, must 
be first strained, then thickened with a small quantity of fliour rub- 
bed smooth in a tea cup, with a little milk. Use white pepper for 
the seasoning, to keep the color pure. 

PARSNIP SOUP. 

Cut in pieces half a dozen parsnips, a head of celery, and two 
onions ; stew them in two quarts of stock until they are tender, 
take them out and pulp them through a coarse sieve, and pour the 
pulp back into the soup, flavor with pepper and salt, and before 
serving pour in a little milk. 

CARROT SOUP. 

Take half a gallon of stock ; add three turnips, six carrots, three 
or four onions, and let them stew till tender. Take out the vege- 
tables, strain the soup ; take off the red part of the carrots, and 
rub it through a colander, make the soup about as thick as cream, 
with the pulped carrot. Heat it well through and serve. 

COLANDERED SOUP. 

Boil in water some peas with salt, pepper, and any vegetables. 
When quite soft mash the whole and bray through a sieve or col- 
ander. Instead of split peas you may use carrots, turnips, aspar- 
agus, or green peas, etc., as the staple. Put your colandered veg- 
etables back into the pot, and if you have any stock, thin the soup 
with it ; if you have no stock, thin with water, or milk and water. 
Boil up, and your dish is fit for table. 

BARLEY SOUP. 

In four quarts of water put two pounds of trimmings or odd 
pieces of meat, a quarter of a pound of pearl barley, four sliced 
onions, salt and pepper, with a little parsley, if you have it. Sim- 
mer for three hours or more. 



30 SOUPS. 



FRENCH SOUP. 



Put first a gallon of water to a sheep's head nicely cleaned, then 
reduce it to half the quantity, and add a teacupful of pearl bar- 
ley, half a dozen large onions, a turnip, a carrot, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, cloves, and a little mushroom or walnut cat- 
sup. Strain all oflf, cut part of the head in pieces and serve it in 
the soup, with a small quantity of white wine. 

PUMPKIN SOUP. 

Take three pounds of ripe pumpkin, peel and remove the seeds, 
cut into pieces of moderate size, and place in a stewpan over the 
fire with a pint of water ; let it boil slowly till soft, strain ofif all 
the water, and pass the pumpkin through a colander ; return the 
pulp into the stew pan adding nearly three pints of milk, one ounce 
or more of butter, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a few lumps of 
loaf sugar ; boil for ten minutes, stirring often. Pour it boiling 
into the dish, on very thin slices of bread. The sugar improves 
the flavor, but may be omitted. It can be seasoned with a blade 
of mace or a little nutmeg. 

GOURD SOUP. 

Cut two pounds of the gourd into large slices, put it into a pan 
with three ounces of butter, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, two of moist 
sugar, a little pepper, and half a pint of water ; set on the fire and 
stew gently for twenty minutes. When reduced to a pulp, add 
two table-spoonfuls of flour, stir and moisten with three pints of 
new milk ; boil with care ten minutes longer, and serve with toast 
in slices: Vegetable marrow is equally good, made into soup ac- 
cording to this receipt. 

ONION SOUP WITH MILK. 

Slice some onions into a stew pan, with a piece of dripping, 
or lard, and a little flour. When brown add a quart of boiling 
milk, pepper, salt, and any cold cooked vegetables at hand. Boil 
up once or twice, and you have a delicious food, without meat or 
stock. 



SOUPS. 31 



ONION SOUP WITH WATER. 

Slice some onions into a stewpan, with any grease at hand, 
and keep them moving about till half brown, then sift in a little 
flour or fine bread-crumbs, and brown well. Now add a quart of 
boiling hot water, with salt, pepper, and some cold cooked vege- 
tables. This would be greatly improved if you could contrive to 
fry in grease a few bits of bread cut into small pieces, and add 
them to the soup when brown. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal three hours, or take some soup stock. Cut 
up two onions, two carrots, and two turnips, and put with it ; also 
pepper, salt and one dozen tomatoes. Boil this two hours, and 
strain it through a sieve. Toast some pieces of bread a light 
brown ; cut them in dice form, and put them into the dish. The 
soup should be turned on to the toast just before it is taken to the 
table, as soaking long spoils it. 

BEEAD SOUP. 

Set the stock on the fire to boil ; let it simmer three or four 
hours. Place in a bowl bits of bread, no matter how hard and 
stale. Pour over them enough hot broth to soak them well ; mash 
fine, and put the whole into the stock. Let it continue to simmer 
a few minutes more after the bread mash has been added. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Put a shin of veal, one onion, two carrots, two turnips, and a 
little salt, into four quarts of water. Boil this three hours ; add 
two cups of vermicelli, and boil it an hour and a half longer. Be- 
fore serving take out the bone and vegetable. 

JENNY LIND's soup. 

The following soup is stated by Miss Bremer, to be the soup 
constantly served to Mademoiselle Jenny Lind, as prepared by 
her own cook. The sago and eggs were found by her soothing to 
the chest, and beneficial to the voice. Wash a quarter of a pound 
of best pearl sago thoroughly, then stew it quite tender and very 



32 SOTJPS. 

thick In water or thick broth ; (it -will require nearly or quite a 
quart of liquid, which should be poured to it cold and heated slow- 
ly ; ) then mix gradually with it a pint of good boiling cream or 
milk, and the yolks of four fresh eggs, and mingle the whole care- 
folly with two quarts of strong veal or beef stock, which should 
slways be kept ready boiling. Serve immediately. 

GERMAN PANCAKE SOUP. 

Make a batter with a pound of flour, a little salt, half a pint of 
milk ; stir well, and add two eggs beaten ; it should be of the con- 
sistency of cream. Make this into pancakes, fried very pale yel- 
low. As each one is fried, lay it on a board and double over 
once. Roll each slightly, and cut into strips half an inch wide, 
and put them into the soup tureen and pour good stock, well sea- 
soned and strained, over them. Serve hot. 

SOUP JARDINIERE. 

Put a bouquet of finely cut vegetables, consisting of celery, a 
carrot, an onion, tomatoes, — two if fresh, two table -spoonfuls if 
canned, — a leek, and a bunch of parsley, in a stew pan, with two 
ounces of butter, pepper, salt, and cover down for nearly an hour ; 
when cooked soft in the butter add a quart or more of broth, and 
two table-spoonfuls of cold jelly gravy, and leave the whole to 
simmer together an hour longer, or until dinner time. During the 
process of coming to a boil, the butter or grease rising to the top 
should be skimmed off and preserved, to be clarified for further 



AN INEXPENSIVE SOUP. 

Take three pounds of the neck of beef, one cow heel, carrots and 
turnips, half a head of celery, one bunch of tied up sweet herbs, 
four onions browned, one pint of peas ; put together into three 
quarts of water and, after boiling some hours, strain through a 
sieve. The best part of the cow heel may be cut in square pieces 
and served up in the soup. 

BAKED SOUP. 

When baking is more convenient, in four quarts of water put 



SOUPS. 83 

one pound of trimmings or odd pieces of meat, two onions, and 
two sliced carrots, two ounces of rice or bits of bread, one pint 
of split peas, pepper and salt. Put the whole into a close jar, and 
bake slowly for four hours. This will make a good, wholesome 
food for a large family. 

HOTCH POTCH. 

Put a pint of peas into a quart of water ; boil them until they 
are so tender as easily to be pulped through a sieve. Take of the 
leanest end of a loin of mutton three pounds, cut it into chops, 
put It into a saucepan with a gallon of water, four carrots, four 
turnips, cut in small pieces ; season with pepper and salt. Boil 
until all the vegetables are quite tender ; put in the pulped peas a 
head of celery and a sliced onion. Boil fifteen minutes, and serve. 

SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH. 

Take the scrag end of a large sized neck of mutton, reserving 
the best half for cutlets, put it into a stewpan and boil it with three 
quarts of water, half a pint of Scotch barley, three leeks, three 
onions, a little parsley and thyme. Skim it, and after it has boiled 
up, let it stand on t* top of the stove and simmer for two hours, 
then skim again, and if it is too thick with barley add half a pint 
of boiling water, three or four turnips, a head of celery, and two 
carrots cut in pieces ; after which, let it simmer slowly an hour and 
a half more ; the barley should be almost wholly dissolved. The 
meat may be cut in pieces and served with the broth or served sep- 
arately. 

BROTH FOR AN INVALID. 

Cut the chicken, veal, mutton or beef, up into pieces, and put 
into a jar with a cover ; fill with water, adding a little salt ; close 
down tight, and let it simmer all day on the stove or range ; strain, 
and season to taste. This method extracts all the juices and 
strength of the meat, and Is infinitely better than boiling. 



MEATS. 



TO BOIL BEEF. 



If the beef is very salt put it in cold water ; if it is only slightly 
corned put it in boiling water, and let it cook very slowly. This 
will render it quite as tender as if put into cold water, and at the 
same time all the juices of the meat will be retained. Boil until 
tender, but not until ragged, so that the meat will cut clean and 
clear, when cold. 

Never buy poor, cheap pieces of corned beef, they are full of 
bone and gristle ; there is no satisfaction in eating from them, and 
they prove the most costly in the end. 

Fresh beef should never be boiled plain, unless it is boiled down 
for soup ; it may be stewed, or cooked alamode, or stuflfed and 
baked, provided the piece is not suitable for roasting. 

STEWED BEEF. 

Take six pounds of round of beef, place it in a deep kettle, 
with half a pint of water, half a pint of broth, a gill of good vin- 
egar, a bunch of parsley, a few cloves, a sprig of sweet marjoram, 
and some salt, and pepper. Let it lay in this over night, turning it 
several times, if it is warm weather ; it is best to give the mixture 
a boil up, putting the meat to it cold. The next day simmer four 
or five hours, adding two onions chopped small ; take up the meat, 
add a tea spoonful of butter braided in flour to the strained liquor, 
with a dash of mushroom catsup. Pour it over the meat, and 
serve. If more liquid is required while stewing, put in broth or 
gravy, if you have it, — ^if not, water. 

CURED BRISKET OF BEEF FOR CHRISTMAS. 

At night rub fourteen pounds of brisket of beef, with one ounce 
of saltpetre pounded very fine ; the next morning mix together 



MEATS. S5 

half a pound of sugar, and four handfuls of common salt, and rub 
the beef well over with it. Let it remain in the pickle two weeks, 
turning and rubbing it every day ; then take it out, and put it into 
an earthen pan, with some suet chopped fine to cover the bottom 
of the pan, and the same on the top of the beef, with a little water 
to keep the pan from burning. Bake it slowly for six hours. 
Eaten cold. 

CURED BEEF, TO EAT COLD. 

Put three fourths of a pound of coarse sugar, one pound of bay 
salt, nearly an ounce of allspice, a tea-spoonful or less of cloves, a 
small piece of saltpetre, and three cents worth of cochineal, into four 
quarts of water ; let these all boil slowly together fully twenty min- 
utes ; then take from the fire, and let it stand till quite cool. Take 
a round of beef, from twenty to twenty-five pounds, and pour this 
pickle over it, turning it once or twice a day, continuing this for 
two or three weeks. At the end of this time it will be ready for 



BOILED BEEF STEAKS. 

It is not necessary to beat them ; cut them half an inch thick 
and place them on the gridiron. The fire should be clear and 
brisk, the gridiron should be hot, the bars rubbed with suet. 
Sprinkle a little salt over the fire. Turn the steaks often, keeping 
a dish close to the fire, in which to drain the gravy from the top 
of the steak as you lift it. The gridiron is best set in a slanting 
direction, so that fat will not fall on the coals and make a smoke. 
If there is a smoke, take the steak off for a moment. Over a brisk 
fire of coals steaks will be done in ten minutes. Then lay them 
on a hot plate with a small slice of butter on each piece, pouring 
over them the gravy, and sprinkling on a very little salt. 

BEEF ALAMODE. 

Lard a round of beef with slices of fat bacon dipped in vinegar; 
roll it up with chopped seasoning, cloves, sage, parsley, thyme, 
pepper and green onions ; bind it close and put it in a sauce pan. 
Tnrn it when half done, and let it stand for twelve hours on a 
stove. It can be eaten hot or cold. 



36 MEATS. 



BRAISED BEEF. 

Take five or six pounds of rump, and cover down close in a pan, 
with enough butter or clarified dripping to prevent burning or 
sticking to the pan ; let it cook slowly fi3r an hour, then pour off 
the grease and put in a little broth, half a cup of rich gravy, a few 
<lrops of vinegar, and a little calf's-foot jelly, if convenient ; cover 
down closely again and let it cook, with the heat all about it, for 
two hours longer, basting frequently ; when it is quite tender, 
take it up, and mix half a table-spoonful of flour with a little cream, 
and put into the gravy, which season to taste, and then pour over 
the meat, that is to say, a part of it, for an economical cook will 
reserve part to assist in the preparation of next day's dinner. 

BRISKET OP BEEF STUFFED. 

A piece weighing eight pounds requires about five or six hours 
to boil. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet 
herbs, a little mace, and one onion chopped fine and mixed with 
an egg. Put the dressing in between the fat and the lean of the 
beef and sew it up tight ; flour the cloth ; pin the beef up very 
tight in it; boil it five or six hours. When it is done take the 
cloth off*, and press it until it is cold. This is to be cut in thin 
slices and eaten cold. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Procure a steak cut from the rump of beef, and fill it with a 
dressing made of chopped bread, pork, sage, onions and sweet 
marjoram, and well seasoned ; sew it up, put a slice or two of pork, 
or some of the dressing, on the top, and set it in a pan, into which 
pour a pint of water ; cover down tight, and let it cook slowly in 
the oven three hours ; then take off the lid, brown quickly, and 
serve hot. 

ox CHEEK STUFFED AND BAKED. 

Mash and soak thoroughly an ox cheek ; put it into plenty of 
warm water and boil gently an hour, throwing in a large tea spoon- 
ful of salt and skimming occasionally. Lift it out, and when cool 
take out the bones. Put in a good roll of forcemeat ; bind up the 



MEATS. 37 

cheek securely, and bake it in a moderate oven an hour or an hour 
and a half, until it is quite tender clear through. Drain it from 
fat, unbind it, and serve it with a good brown gravy, or any sauce 
preferred, or with melted butter in a tureen, a cut lemon and 
cayenne. 

SPICED BEEF. 

This can be made from either the round, brisket or rump of 
beef, but ribs are the most tender eating. Procure from eight to 
ten pounds of the ribs of beef; those which have a good amount 
of fat upon them are the best ; remove the bone, rub the meat well 
with one ounce of saltpetre pounded very finely, and three hours 
after this has been applied, rub on half a pound of moist sugar ; 
let the meat lay in this for two days, then take one ounce of ground 
pepper, half an ounce of pounded mace, a few cloves well pound- 
ed, and a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper. Mix all these ingredi- 
ents well, and rub them well into the beef, particularly into the 
holes, adding occasionally a little salt. Roll up the meat as a 
round, and bind it with a strong fillet. Chop some suet very 
finely, cover the beef with it, and bake it in a moderately heated 
oven, from five to six hours. While baking, it may be placed 
either upon a meat tin, or in an earthen jar as nearly of its size 
as possible. In both cases there should be a cup full of gravy or 
water under the meat, to prevent it from burning ; if a jar is used 
there should be a cover to it. 

FILLETS OF BEEF. 

Take two pounds of steak from a round of beef, cut thin, divide 
it into strips about three inches broad ; beat them with a chopper 
till flat and tender, then chop finely some fresh gathered mush- 
rooms, and add a little pepper, salt, and fresh butter in small pieces. 
Lay the mushrooms and seasoning half over the strips of steak ; 
roll them up, fasten them with a coarse needle and thread, (or with 
very tiny skewers,) and lay the fillets in a pie dish to bake. The 
baking dish should be covered with another dish of the same 
size, to prevent the steam from evaporating, otherwise the outside 
of the meat will be dry. Thicken the gravy which is in the baking 
dish with flour and butter, and add mushroom catsup as a seasoning. 



38 MEATS. 

The fillets will require turning whilst baking. But a less trouble- 
some plan of cooking a steak in this mode, is to have it dressed in 
one piece. The steak should be cut thin and rolled as described, 
but instead of mushrooms add a fine forcemeat or plain veal 
stuffing. 

FILLETS OF BEEF WITH ANCHOVY. 

Soak five or six anchovies in water for about two hours, split 
them and put the fillet with them, mixed with some bacon ; boil 
it on a slow fire with a small quantity of broth, a glass of white 
wine, a clove of garlic, two cloves, and a bunch of herbs. When 
sufficiently done, strain the sauce, add to it a piece of butter roll- 
ed in flour, two spoonsful of cream, and a few capers ; mix in a 
little yolk of egg, and pour it over the fillet. 

FILLETS OF BEEF WITH FORCEMEAT. 

Make forcemeat with fowls' livers, grated bacon, a little butter, 
parsley, shallots, three yolks of eggs, and spices. Cut a fillet of 
beef in two, flatten it with a cleaver, lard it through, then lay the 
forcemeat between it, and also about a pint of small mushrooms 
which have been previously stewed in a little butter ; tie the meat 
up in a cloth, boil it in broth, with a glass of wine and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. 

HUNTERS BEEF. 

Take a round of beef weighing fifteen pounds, and let it hang 
two or three days. Reduce to a very fine powder two ounces of 
saltpetre, two ounces of sugar, three quarters of an ounce of 
cloves, the same of nutmeg, one third of an ounce of allspice, two 
handsful of common salt. Bone the beef, and rub the spices well 
into it, and do so every day for two or three weeks. When you 
wish to dress the meat, wash the spices off the outside with cold, 
water, bind it up tightly with tape, and place it in a pan with a 
tea-cupful of water at the bottom ; cover the top of the meat with 
chopped suet ; cover the pan with a coarse paste, and brown pa- 
per over that. Let it bake five hours, and when it is cold remove 
the paste and the tape. Some persons stuff the hole left by taking 
out the bone, with chopped parsley and sweet herbs. 



MEATS. 39. 



hiJng beef. 



Make a strong brine of bay salt, saltpetre and pump water. 
Place in it a piece of ribs of beef, and let it lie for nine days. 
Then hang it in a chimney in the smoke of wood or sawdust. 
When it is nearly dry, wash the outside with bullock's blood, and 
when this is dry, boil it and serve it with vegetables. 

HAMBURGH PICKLE FOR BEEF, HAMS AND TONGUE. 

Take two gallons of water, three pounds of bay salt, or if that 
cannot be got, five pounds of common salt, two pounds of coarse 
sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of black pepper 
bruised and tied in a fold of muslin ; boil all together twenty min- 
utes, removing the scum as it rises. Pour the pickle into a deep 
earthen jar, and when it is cold lay in the meat so that every part 
is covered. Turn the meat occasionally. A middling sized round 
of beef will be ready for the table in a fortnight. 

MEAT PIE FOR LUNCH. 

Place a thick rump steak well larded and rubbed with shallot in 
the bottom of a saucepan, cut up some game into small pieces 
without bones, and lay over the steak, mixed with pepper and salt 
and some pieces of bacon ; stew them all well, and add chopped 
mushrooms and a rich gravy, before making them into the pie. 
The pfe should have a thick ornamental crust round the sides and 
on the» bottom. Let the top crust be loose, so that additional 
gravy can be poured in ; and bake until it is a light brown. 

BEEP BALLS. 

Take a piece of beef boiled tender, chop it very finely with an 
onion, season with salt and pepper, add parsley, bread crumbs, 
lemon peel, and grated nutmeg ; moisten it with an egg, mix well 
together, and roll it into balls. Then dip them in flour and fry 
them in boiling lard or fresh dripping. Serve them with thickened 
brown gravy, or fried bread crumbs. 

BEEF CROQUETTES. 

Mnce some dressed beef very fine, melt a piece of butter in a 



40 MEATS. 

stew pan, add three or four onions, chopped fine, and fried a pale 
brown ; add a spoonful of flour, and moisten with a little good 
stock, or gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little 
parsley chopped fine. When the sauce is done enough, put in the 
niinced beef; let it stew a short time till the sauce is dry, then 
form the meat into either balls or rolls ; dip each into the beaten 
white of eggs ; have some butter, or lard, hot ; put each ball 
very gently into the frying pan, shaking a little flour over them, 
roll them about gently in the pan to brown them alike, and when 
a good color, drain them on a cloth, and serve on dressed parsley. 

HASHED BEEF. 

Take cold roast beef, cut in slices, and remove skin and gristle. 
Place in a stewpan a small piece of butter, an onion chopped 
fine, a table-spoonful of flour ; put it on the fire and stir it till it 
browns, but be careful it does not burn. Then stir in gradually 
half a pint of stock, flavored with herbs, with a little salt, and let 
it boil up thick. Put in two table-spoonsful of hot green pickles 
chopped small, and the slices of beef. Heat them through and 
serve with sippets of toast. 

COLD MINCED BEEF. 

Having removed the fat and skin, mince the beef nearly to a 
paste : stew gently — if possible over night, so that the fat may 
be skimmed off. Season with pepper and salt, and sprinkle with 
oat-meal ; chop a half handful of parsley and thyme and throw in ; 
boil a large onion nearly tender, chop it and mix it in ; add sufficent 
broth or skim-milk and water to cover the beef; let it simmer two 
hours ; then thicken with a little oatmeal, and add a dessert spoon- 
ful of mushroom or walnut catsup ; stir well, boil a minute and serve 
with pieces of bread toasted. The bones from which the meat is 
cut wiU do for the broth in which the meat is stewed, if broth is 
used. Even then, however, a tea-cupful of milk may be added 
with the thickening. 

DRIED BEEF COOKED. 

Afl;er being thinly sliced, as usual, freshen it in water ; stew it in 
a little water until tender ; then beat an egg with a little flour, put 



MEATS. 41 

a lump of butter to the beef, stir in the egg and flour, and serve 
on toast bread with the gravy over it. 

KEEPING BEEF. 

Cut up the meat in pieces as large as you wish, and pack it in 
a barrel or cask. Then make a brine as follows : one pound and 
a half of salt to one gallon of water, one ounce of saltpetre to one 
hundred pounds of beef, one table-spoonful of ground pepper to 
one hundred pounds of beef. Put in the salt and saltpetre, heat 
it boiling hot, skim it, then add the pepper. Pour it on the beef 
boiling hot and cover closely. 

TOUGH BEEF. 

Carbonate of soda will remedy tough beef. Cut the steaks the 
day before using into slices about two inches thick; rub over 
them a small quantity of soda ; wash off next morning, cut it into 
suitable thickness, and cook. The same process will answer for 
fowls, legs of mutton, etc. 

A LEG OF MUTTON IN FOUR MEALS. 

For the first meal, cut off a handsome knuckle and boil it ; for the 
second meal, take as many cutlets as required for the family from 
the joint ; for the third meal, roast the remainder of the joint. The 
remains of both the boiled and roasted meat, may then be hashed 
for a fourth meal. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 

Cut off the shank bone and trim the knuckle. Boil with salt 
in the water, skimming. If it weighs nine or ten pounds it will 
need to cook three hours. It may be served with parsley or celery 
and butter, or caper sauce, or pickled kidney beans and onion 
sauce ; mashed turnips, spinach and potatoes are good with it. 

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weiring ten pounds should be roasted two 
hours. VVhen half done, turn the fat out of the roaster; then 
baste the meat with the dripping. Make the gravy the same as for 
roast beef, or add a few spoonsful of current jelly and a cup of 



42 MEATS. 

red wine. Ten minutes more should be allowed for every extra 
pound of mutton. 

LEG OF MUTTOX WITH OYSTERS. 

Parboil fat oysters and mix with them some parsley, minced 
onions, and sweet herbs, boiled and chopped fine, and the yolks of 
two hard boiled eggs. Cut five or six holes in the flfeshy part of a leg 
of mutton, and put in the mixture ; dress it as follows : Tie it 
up in a cloth and let it boil gently two and a half or three hours, 
according to the size. 

ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB. 

A nice way to cook a shoulder of lamb is to bone It, and fill the 
space with a stuffing made of chopped mushrooms, parsley, salt 
pork, cracker crumbs, some sweet herbs, pepper and salt, and a 
raw egg. Braise it with some good stock gravy, and send it to 
table surrounded by spinach, garnished with slices of egg. 

ROAST QUARTER OF LAMB. 

To roast a quarter of lamb, lard it slightly with salt pork, and 
sprinkle it with bread crumbs and finely-chopped parsley. Make 
a sauce of some stock gravy, a table-spoonful of vinegar, chopped 
mint, a little yolk of egg, and mushroom catsup ; pour over the 
joint, and let it stand in the oven a few moments. Serve with

onion sliced thin ; pour in broth or stock to just cover over it, and 
let it simmer until at boiling heat, but do not let it boil. Pour it 
imto an earthen dish and cover it for the night. In the morning, 
or sometime before dinner, skim off the fat, return it to the pot

HASHED MUTTON WITH MUSHROOMS. 

Take nice slices of mutton, without skin or fat, and sprinkle 
each piece with flour on both sides. Put six large mushrooms, 
after having been trimmed and cut in four pieces, into a stewpan 
with a small piece of butter, to stew ; add a little gravy, some pep- 
per and salt, and when sufficiently done, put in the meat ; let it 
heat through, slowly, stirring it the while that it may not burn, 
but not let it boil, or the meat will be hard. As soon as the hash 
thickens and the flour is all heat through and changed color, the 
hash is done. Serve immediately with sippets of neatly cut, thin 
toast, or fried bread, round the dish. 

MINCED MUTTON. 

Prepare a sauce by taking finely chopped onions, parsley, and 
sweet herbs ; fry in butter, and add a table-spoonful of flour mixed 
in water or stock, and as much stock as required. Mince cold 
boiled or roast mutton, taking only the good parts, place it in the 
sauce and warm it through without boiling. This should be 
served with poached eggs on the top. 

MINCED MUTTON WITH CUCUMBERS. 

To prepare minced mutton and cucumber, the mutton should be 
minced as before, then a large cucumber should be pared, the 
seeds taken out, and cut up in small, square pieces about the size 
of a nutmeg. Stew till tender in savory brown sauce, and put in

gon vinegar, two tea-spoonsful of curry paste, a small lump of 
sugar, and a little pepper and salt to taste ; let this sauce just boil 
up once and then simmer slowly by the fire for half an hour ; stir 



46 MEATS. 

it often, and thicken it with a table spoonful of flour, mixed smooth 
in a little cold water ; or you can use corn starch, half the quantity 
will do. When the thickening has boiled thoroughly, and the 
sauce ready, put in the meat, let it heat through but not boil. Serve 
hot, with pieces of toast round the dish. 

QUARTER OF LAMB AS A SAVORY DISH. 

Procure a hind quarter of lamb, and cut off the shank from It. 
Raise the thick part of the flesh from the bone with a knife. Pre- 
pare some forcemeat, the same as for veal or any other white meat, 
and place it between the bone and flesh, and all underneath the 
kidney. Roast the lamb partially, then place It on a saucepan 
with a quart of mutton gravy ; cover It up and let It stew gently. 
When it Is sufficiently cooked, take It up and lay it upon a hot 
dish. Skim the fat from the gravy, and strain it ; add a wine glass 
full of sherry orMaderIa wine, a dessert spoonful of walnut catsup, 
two of browning, the juice of half a lemon, a little cayenne pepper* 
and half a pint of bearded oysters. Thicken with a little butter 
rolled in flour ; pour the gravy hot over the lamb, and serve it up. 

SHOULDER OF VEAL. 

Put into an earthen pan a glass of water, two or three spoonsful 
of vinegar, three onions, sliced parsley, chives, two shallots, a bay 
leaf, a bit of thyme, two cloves, and about two ounces of butter ; 
cover the pan close, and put a paste of coarse flour and water 
round the edges, to keep in the steam; let it bake three hours, 
strain the sauce and pour over the meat, after seasoning It with 
pepper and salt. Another way is to stuff it with bread crumbs, 
suet, or butter, parsley, a little thyme and lemon peel, pepper, salt 
and nutmeg ; then lard it, and roast until brown, serving it with 
rich brown gravy. 

STEWED LOIN OF VEAL. 

Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do ; put It into 
a large, thick, well tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, two 
ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire, until it begins 
to brown ; flour the veal well all over, lay it Into the saucepan, 
and when it is of a light brown, pour in gradually veal broth, 



MEATS. 47 

grav}', or boiling water, to nearly half its depth ; add a little salt, 
one or two sliced carrots, a small onion or more, and a bunch of 
parsley ; stew the veal very gently for an hour or more ; then turn 
and let it stew another hour until it is perfectly done. Dish the 
joint ; skim all the fat from the gravy, and strain it over the meat, 
or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced to a richer consis- 
tency. 

BREAST OF VEAL STUFFED. 

Cut off the gristle, raise the meat off the bones, then lay a good 
forcemeat, made of pounded veal, some sausage meat, parsley, and 
a few shallots chopped very fine, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg ; then roll the veal tightly, and sew it with the twine ; lay 
some slices of fat bacon in a stewpan, and put the veal roll on it ; 
add some stock, pepper, salt, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; let it 
stew three hours ; then cut out the twine, strain the sauce after 
skimming it, thicken it with brown flour ; let it boil up once, and 
pour it over the veal ; garnish with slices of lemon, each cut in 
four. A fillet of veal, first stuffed with forcemeat, can be dressed 
in the same manner, but it must first be roasted, so as to brown it 
a good color ; and forcemeat balls, highly seasoned, should be 
served round the veal. 

BREAST OF VEAL STEWED. 

Brown the veal first, by half roasting it ; remove as many of the 
bones as possible, and then put it in a stewpan with some stock, a 
glass of wine, a piece of lemon peel, a bunch of sweet herbs, a 
ham bone, and a carrot ; let it simmer slowly in the oven about 
half an hour before it is served ; strain off the sauce and remove 
the herbs, etc., put it then back with the veal, first thickening it 
with some flour browned with butter ; let it boil up to take off the 
raw taste of the flour ; then add some pickled mushrooms with their 
juice, and serve. 

ROAST FILLET OF VEAL. 

Take out or ask the butcher to do so, the bone from the center, 
and fill the cavity with a stuffing of bread crumbs, nice salt pork,

up together until thoroughly blended ; with the remainder fill up 
all the interstices and fasten with skewers ; cover down in a bake- 
pan with a teacupful of water, for an hour and a half, basting oc- 
casionally ; then remove the cover and roast until it becomes a rich 
brown. This dish is a universal favorite. 

LOIN OF VEAL 

This is best larded. Have every joint thoroughly cut, and be- 
tween each one lay a slice of salt pork ; roast a fine brown, and 
so that the upper sides of the pork will be crisp ; baste often ; 
season with pepper ; the pork will make it sufliciently salt. 

KNUCKLE OP VEAL.' 

The knuckle, which is left after cutting off" the fillet, makes excel- 
lent soup, or is very good boiled with rice. It should cook slowly 
on the top of the range, so that the rice will not burn, and be 
dished up with the meat in the center, and small pieces of butter 
placed at intervals round it, in the rice. 

KNUCKLE OF VEAL "WITH RICE. 

Boil a knuckle of veal, two turnips, one onion, six pepper-corns, 
a head of celery, and a tea-cupful of rice, together, very gently on 
the top of the stove for about three hours, skimming occasionally, 
and mixing in a little salt. When done, send it to the table with 
rice around the veal. The stock in which the veal has boiled, will 
help to make good soup. 

VEAL CUTLETS." 

Take six neck cutlets of veal, trim them neatly, and cut ofif the 
bone ; lard the cutlets, put them into a -frying-pan with a little 
butter, and let them brown ; shake a little flour over them, and then 
moisten them with a little stock ; add a bunch of fine herbs, some 
carrots cut in forms, or scalloped, some small onions, mushrooms, 
salt, two cloves ; when the cutlets are done enough, dish them and 
put the vegetables in the middle ; skim the sauce, strain it, and 
pour it over the cutlets. They must be well seasoned. 

MINCED VEAL WITH MACARONI.

mer gently, taking care that it does not boil. Serve it upon small 
squares of buttered toast, and surround it with a border of maca- 
roni, cooked without cheese. 

VEAL FRITTERS. 

Cut cold boiled veal into small pieces, dip each in butter, fry 
them a light brown color, drain them well from the fat, pile them

use tomato sauce. 

BLANQUETTE OP VEAL. 

Cut cold roast veal in small pieces, put half a pint of white 
sauce, and a little mushroom catsup in a sauce-pan ; when it boils,

an egg slightly beaten ; when the sauce thickens put in a little juice 
of lemon, and send to table. 

VEAL ROLLS. 

Cut some slices of veal very thin and divide them into neat 
pieces. Lay on each some good forcemeat, seasoned high ; roll 
each up tight, and tie them with coarse thread ; put them on a bird 
spit ; after dipping each in the yolks of eggs, well beaten, flour 
them over, and baste them with butter ; half an hour will do them . 
Have a good gravy ready, with truffles and mushrooms chopped ; 
and after dishing the rolls, pour the gravy round them. 

MOCK BEEFSTEAK. 

Take a leg of veal and corn it slightly, by sprinkling salt over 
it ; let it lay a week, then cut from it steaks, which fry in the fat 
from a few thin slices of browned salt pork, or broil and serve 
with butter and pepper ; no salt will be needed.

made by mixing cold gravy or soup stock with a table-spoonful of 
flour, a little thyme, pepper, salt, and some button mushrooms ; 
pour this over the veal and ham, and let the whole simmer together

moved from the grease in which they were fried, and placed in a 
clean pan before the sauce is poured over them. 

MmCED VEAL. 

Take the part that is rare done, of either roasted or boiled veal, 
and chop it very fine. Take beef gravy sufficient for the veal to 
be cooked in, dissolve cavear, of the quantity of an acorn, to one

Cut two thin steaks from a fillet of veal, beat them and rub them 
over with the yolk of an egg ; then cut them in strips from four 
to five inches in length ; lay over every strip a very thin piece of 
fat bacon, and strew them over with bread crumbs, a little lemon 
peel, and parsley, chopped small ; season with cayenne pepper and 
salt. Roll them up separately, and fasten them with a little wood- 
en skewer in each. Dip them into egg, bread crumbs and parsley, 
chopped small. Put some clarified beef dripping into a frying pan, 
let it boil up, then throw in the veal olives and fry them a light 
brown color. Take a pint of good gravy, add to it a dessert- 
spoonful of lemon pickle, and same of walnut catsup, and one

MEATS. 51 



VEAL CHEESE. 

Take the hind quarter of veal, add three eggs, one pound of 
pork, half a loaf of bread ; season with salt and pepper to taste ; 
chop, and wet the whole with milk. Bake two hours, then turn it

half a pint of cream, two eggs, a small quantity of summer- 
savory, pepper, and salt ; cook about ten minutes. Take the leg 
of pork, of seven or eight pounds in weight, and raise the skin 
off the knuckle, and put in the stuffing, then make deep cuts in 
the thick part, of the leg, and fill them also. It must be floured 
over, and a pint of water put in the pan. While roasting, baste 
it often with the drippings. Cook about three hours and a half. 
Skim some of the fat from the gravy, add a little flour, and boil it

neat form, take oflf part of the fat. To broil them, sprinkle a little 
pepper on them, and broil them over a clear and moderate fire a 
quarter of an hour, or a few minutes more ; and just before taking 
them off, sprinkle over a little fine salt. For frying, flour them 
well and season with pepper, and salt, and sage. They may also 
be dipped into an egg, and then into bread crumbs mixed with 
minced sage ; if for broiling, add a little clarified butter to the egg, 
or sprinkle it on the cutlets. 

BOSTON PORK AND APPLE PIE. 

Boil one pound of nice, sweet, salt pork, and when it is cold 
chop it up fine. Peel half a peck of greening apples, chop them

with cinnamon and ground cloves, or allspice, and bake in deep 
soup plates, slowly and thoroughly, with a crust on both sides, 

ENGLISH PORK OR RAISED PIE. 

These constitute a favorite luncheon dish in England. Take a 
pound of nice lard, and heat it until melted, in a little water. 
Use this hot melted lard to mix the flour into a paste, with a little 
salt. Work the paste very smooth, divide it, and form each piece 
into a round ball, gradually working a hollow in the centre, and 
raising a wall, two, three, or four inches high all round, according 
to the size required. Have ready the pork, fat and lean, cut into 
small square pieces ; fill each pie, season highly, fit a lid neatly to

slice or two of bacon cut into very fine mince meat ; mix all well 
together, fry and scorch the top with a red hot poker. 

BACON EGG-CAP. 

Cut a quarter of a pound of bacon into thin slices and stew them 
slowly, turning them over and over. Take out the slices and put 
to the grease two spoonsful of any stock you happen to have, and 
break over it six or seven eggs. Now add your slices of bacon 
again, pepper and salt, cook over a slow fire, and scorch the top 
with a red hot poker. 

PORK RELISH. 

Fry some slices of salt pork till crisp, take them out, pour a 
little water to the fat and season it with pepper ; sprinkle in a 
little flour, then cut up the pork into small pieces and put it into 
this thickened gravy. 

TO CURE HAMS. — 1 

Weigh your hams, and make a brine of one ounce of salt to every 
pound of meat, and one ounce of saltpetre to every twenty pounds. 
Cover the bottom of the tub with salt ; pack the hams close, and 
fill the chinks with stones. Let the brine cover them well. After 
they have lain three or four weeks, take them up, dry and smoke 
them. Then wrap them in papers and lay them in ashes in a cool, 
dry cellar. This keeps the flies from them, and prevents them 
from getting dry and hard. Hams cured in this way, keep the 
year round. 

TO CURE HAMS. — 2. 

For every one hundred lbs. of ham, take seven lbs. of salt, three 
ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of pearlash, one quart of molasses, 
five gallons of water. Re-pack the hams at the end of the first 
week, and put the same pickle on them again.

BOILED IIAM. 



A ham, if dry, may be soaked over night ; if moist, this may be 
omitted. Put it in warm water, and boil it for five or six hours. 
If it is salt, the water may be changed once, though it should not 
be put into cold water. Soft water is best ; if the water is hard, 
a little soda may be added to it. If it is desired to give the flavor 
of ham to vegetables, they may be boiled in some of the liquor the 
ham was boiled in, but the vegetables should not be put in with 
the ham. When done take off the skin, which should be kept as 
whole as possible, (to put over the ham when cold, which will pre- 
vent its drying,) and grate toasted bread over it. Boiled ham is 
best eaten cold. When served, remove the skin, stick cloves at 
intervals with a ring of pepper around them, and garnish with 
parsley, or put fringed paper around the small end. 

SUGAKED HAM. 

Afler boiling the ham three hours, remove the skin, sprinkle 
sugar over it and bake one hour. It will be delicious. 

POTTED HAM. 

Take the remains of a boiled ham, cut in small pieces, and 
pound it, little by little, in a mortar ; soflening it during the pro- 
cess, with a little melted butter. Add Cayenne pepper to taste, 
and put it in small bowls, glasses, or potting jars, pressing it down 
very smooth. Over the surface pour a little more melted butter ; 
cover tight, and set away. It will keep for weeks. This is a 
nice supper dish. 

BROILED HAM. 

Cut the ham in thin slices, and broil quick, on a gridiron » set 
over lively hot coals. If the ham is too salt, soak it in hot water 
before broiling, and dry it with a cloth before putting it on the 
fire. Fry some eggs in an equal quantity of lard and butter, put 
an egg on each slice of ham, and serve. 

WESTPHALIA LOAVES. 

Mix a quarter of a pound of grated ham, with one pound of 



MEATS. 55 

mealy potatoes, well beaten until quite light, and add a little butter, 
cream, and two eggs ; but do not get it too moist. Make into 
small balls, and fry with a little lard, a light brown. Serve with 
a brown thick gravy. Garnish with fried parsley. 

HAM OR TONGUE TOAST. 

Toast a thick shce of bread, and butter it on both sides. Take 
a small quantity of remains of ham, or tongue, and grate it, and 
put it in a stew-pan with two hard boiled eggs chopped fine, mixed 
with a little butter, salt, and cayenne ; make it quite hot, then 
spread thickly upon the buttered toast. Serve while hot.

of beef, in a middling sized dish, having seasoned it with pepper 
and salt. Have a couple of chickens at hand, cut in pieces and 
seasoned ; place them upon the steak, and over them one dozen 
and a half of fresh fat oysters, without the liquor. Add half a 
dozen fresh, hard boiled eggs, and after damping the bottom of the 
dish with half a pint of strong ale, cover the whole with fresh 
mushrooms, adding to these half a pound of glaze or plam neats- 
foot-jelly; lay over the dish a substantial paste, and bake in a 
brisk oven. This pie is excellent for a picnic or water excursion. 

IRISH STEW. — 1.

ton, and cut it into chops ; season them with pepper and salt, some 
mushroom powder, and beaten mace. Put the meat into a stew- 
pan, slice a large onion, and tie up a bunch of parsley and thyme, 
and add these and a pint of veal broth to the meat. Let this sim- 
mer until the chops are about three parts done, then add some on- 
ions, and whole potatoes peeled, and let all stew together until 
thoroughly cooked. Take out the parsley and thyme, and serve 
up in a deep dish. 

IRISH STEW. — 2. 

Take as much of mutton as is required ; the scrag end is the 
best for the purpose. Cut the meat into small chops, pare all the 
fat off the piece, chop it fine, and set it aside for dumplings ; let 
the meat stew till perfectly tender, strain the liquor, and set the 
meat aside. The following day remove the fat, put the liquor in a 
sauce pan, roll each piece of mutton in flour, add the meat to the 



SECONDARY MEATS. 57 

liquor, and sufficient potatoes and onions to thicken it. Before 
serving, add a layer of potatoes, boiled in a separate sauce-pan, 
also dumplings, about the size of an egg. The dumplings will take 
about twenty minutes to boil. No seasoning is required except 
pepper and salt. 

BAKED IRISH STEW. 

Fill a dish with alternate layers of mutton or beef, sliced pota- 
toes and onions ; season with pepper and salt, pour in plenty of 
^ater for gravy, and cover the top closely with potatoes ; cook in 
a moderate oven, and let the potatoes on top be browned before it 
is served ; the onion can be omitted if desired. 

BOILED TONGUE. 

Saltpetered tongue requires five or six hours to boil. When 
done, lay it in cold water three minutes, peel oflf the skin, beginning 
at the tip of the tongue, as it comes off much easier. 

SWEETBREAD. 

Add to a pint of water, or veal stock, a little grated lemon peel, 
mace, and pepper and salt; in this put your sweetbreads, — two 
good sized ones ; stew them an hour or more ; then take them out, 
mix a teaspoonful of flour with a little milk, mushrooms, and cat- 
sup, and add to the liquor when it boils ; put in the sweetbread for 
a moment. Serve with the sauce poured over them. 

TO FRY SWEETBREAD. 

Scald them first ; fry them in butter, with a little sweet marjoram 
and parsley chopped fine, and served with a gravy, flavored with 
mushroom catsup. 

MEAT OMNIUM. 

Take all the pieces of cooked meat you have, no matter whether 
boiled or roast, butcher's meat, poultry or game, and mince very 
fine. Put the whole into a stew-pan, with a little parsley, a few 
green onions, and mushrooms, if you can get them, one or two 
eggs beaten up> and a little gravy or stock. Simmer for a quarter 
of an hour ; then take a meat dish, pour upon it a layer of your

stew, a layer of bread in slices, another layer of stew, and so on, 
and heat in an oven. When hot, pour it over the rest of the stew 
hot, and serve. 

SAUSAGE MEAT. 

Take one pound of fresh pork, two pounds of lean beef, and 
chop them very fine ; mix this with three tea-spoonfuls of black 
pepper, the same quantity of salt, five of powdered sage, and five 
of summer-savory ; make this into small cakes and place them upon 
a plate. When needed, fry them in the same manner as sausages. 

GOOD SAUSAGES. 

First chop separately, and then together, a pound and a quarter 
of veal, free from fat, skin, and sinew, and an equal weight of lean 
pork, and of the inside fat of the pig. Mix them well, and sprin- 
kle on an ounce and a quarter of salt, half an ounce of pepper, 
one nutmeg grated, and a large tea-spoonful of pounded mace. 
Turn and chop all together until equally seasoned throughout; 
press the sausages into a clean pan, and keep them in a very cool 
place. When wanted, form them into cakes an inch thick or less 
flour and fry them about ten minutes, in a little butter. 

RISSABLES. 

Chop veal and ham together finely, add a few bread crumbs, 
salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little parsley and lemon peel, or shallot ; 
mix all together with the yolks of eggs well beaten ; either roll 
them into shape like a flat sausage, or into the shape of pears, 
sticking a bit of horseradish in the ends, to resemble the stalks ; 
egg each over, and grate bread crumbs ; fry them brown and serve 
on crisp fried parsley. 

GR.\JSrDMOTHER's BREAKFAST BALLS. 

A httle cold beef, or mutton, or both ; a s^ice of ham, or salt 
pork ; a small quantity of bread crumbs, a little parsley, a little 
sage, or thyme, all chopped together, and mixed with an egg, a 
little melted butter, and seasoning. Take a table spoonful of the 
mixture, dredge it with the flour, and make into a ball, which fry 
a quick brown. 



SECONDARY MEATS. 59 

This constitutes an elegant breakfast dish, and is a good way of 
getting rid of cold meat, particularly if hash is not liked. 

TURKISH DALMA. 

Chop the lean of any cold meat, with a quarter pound of beef 
wet, very fine ; mix with quarter pound of scalded rice ; season 
with salt, pepper, and add the yolks of two eggs. Take cabbage 
leaves, dip them in water, make the meat into shape of cucumbers, 
and fold the leaves round them, tying each with a thread ; put them 
into a stewpan with gravy, an anchovy, and an onion : stew a long 
time gently. The thread is taken off when served, and the gravy 
browned with flour and a little butter. 

TO COOK COLD MEATS. 

Put the cold meat into a chopping bowl, cut them fine, season 
with salt, pepper, a little onion or else tomato catsup. Fill a tin 
bread pan two thirds full; cover it over with mashed potato 
which has been salted and has milk in it ; lay bits of butter over 
the top, and set it into an oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

SAVORY WINTER HASH. 

Any kind of cold meat, a few cold potatoes, an onion, pepper 
and salt, a little dried parsley, sage, and summer savory. Chop 
all together. Put it in a sauce-pan, with a little gravy, or hot wa- 
ter, and a small piece of butter. Let it simmer gently for fifteen 
minutes. Turn out over thin slices of toast. It is palatable to 
persons who do not usually like hash. 

TOAD IN THE HOLE. 

Make a batter of six ounces of flour, one pint of milk, two or 
three eggs, a little lard, salt and pepper ; put into it a pound of 
beef sausages, and bake for an hour. Instead of beef sausages, 
slices of any meat you have, or half a pound of pork sausages, or 
a few oysters with meat trimmings, may be used. 

cow HEEL. 

Boil in water a split cow heel (one already used for stock will 
do) four or five hours ; then add a pint of milk, and boil for two 



60 SECONDARY MEATS. 

hours more, adding an onion or tAvo, and if you like, a little chop- 
ped parsley. 

FRIED cow HEEL. 

Cut a stewed cow heel into pieces about two inches long, and put 
the pieces into a frying pan with bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and 
a little minced parsley. You will require to have grease in the 
pan, and it should be boiling before you put your cow heel in. 
About a quarter of an hour will suffice for frying. It would be a 
great improvement if you were to beat up an egg and dip each 
piece into it, before you put it into the hot frying pan. 

sheep's trotters. 

Into a stewpan put a little suet with sliced onions and carrots, 
thyme, salt and pepper ; let these simmer for about five minutes. 
Next add two spoonsful of flour and water, and keep stirring till it 
boils ; when it boils, put in the trotters and simmer for three 
hours or more. Now mix in two eggs, beaten up in milk, but do 
not let your stewpan boil again. Pour into a deep dish, and gar- 
nish with toasted bread. 

SWEET BREAD, LIVER AND HE.VRT. 

Parboil the sweet bread, and let them get cold. Cut them in 
pieces about an inch thick ; put on salt, and pepper and sage ; 
then dip them in the yolk of an egg and fine bread crumbs. 
Fry them a light brown. Another way is, to fry slices of salt pork 
until brown, take out the pork and fry the sweet bread in the fat. 
When done, make a gravy by stirring a little flour and water mix- 
ed smooth, into the fat; add spices, and wine, if you like. The 
liver and heart are cooked in the same manner, or broiled. 

calf's head cake. 

Parboil half a calf's head, with a little sage ; cut off the meat, 
put the bones back into the broth, and boil them until the broth is 
much reduced. Cut up the meat and put it into the jar with the 
tongue, mace, pepper, &c., add a few small slices of ham ; put the 
jar into the oven covered, and let it stand some hours until the con- 
tents are thoroughly done ; then mix it with the brains beaten up 



SECONDARY MEATS. 61 

with an egg. Put pieces of hard boiled egg in a mold, pour the 
mixture from the jar into it, and let it get entirely cold, then turn 
it out. This dish can be made also with sheep's head, carefully 
scalded and soaked. 

calf's head hash. 

Take a calf's head or half a one, as you desire ; parboil it, cut 
off the best parts in slices, and set these aside for the hash. Put 
the rest, bones and all, with any other bones you may have, es- 
pecially a ham bone, each into the liquor with a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a sliced carrot, a fried onion, half head of celery, mace, 
salt, and peppercorns, according to taste. Let these ingredients 
stew gently together, until the liquor is so strong that, when it is 
cold, it will form a jelly. Strain it through a hair sieve, and after- 
wards through a cloth, and when cold, remove all the fat which 
may rise to the top. Take of this jelly the quantity that may bo 
required for gravy, put it into a sauce-pan, and add to it mushroom 
catsup, Worcester sauce, a little lemon peel, and Chili wine. Now 
put in the slices of meat, and let them warm gently, but do not let 
them boil. Before serving to table add, if you desire, a wine-glass 
of sherry, and a table-spoonful of brandy, and garnish with brain 
cakes and slices of lemon. Butter may be added to the gravy to 
make it thicker. 

lamb's head and hinge. 

Soak the head well in cold water and boil it a quarter of an hour. 
Parboil the heart, liver, and if desired, the lights ; mince them 
quite small, mix them with gravy, season them, pour them on sip- 
pets of toasted bread in a soup dish, broil the bread and lay it 
upon the mince. It can be garnished with sliced pickled cucum- 
bers and slices of bacon. 

BPAIN CAKES. 

Wash the brains thoroughly, first in cold and afterwards in hot 
water; remove the skin and fibers, and then boil the brains in 
water with a little salt, for two or three minutes. Take them up 
and beat them in a basin with some very finely chopped parsley, 
sifted sage, salt, mace, cayenne pepper, the well-beaten yolk of 



62 SECONDARY MEATS. 

an egg, and a gill of cream. Drop tliem in small cakes into the 
frying pan, and fry them in butter a light brown color. A little 
flour and grated lemon peel are sometimes added, 

TRIPE. 

The tripe, after being corned, should be soaked in salt and water 
five or six days, changing the water every day ; then cut it in 
pieces, scrape it and rinse it. Boil it until quite tender, which 
will take half a day or more, and it will then be fit for broihng, 
frying or pickling. Drop it into a jar of spiced vinegar. 

FREED TRIPE. 

After being boiled, let it be quite cold ; cut it in pieces, roll 
them cornerwise, tie them with a thread, sprinkle a little salt and 
mace over them, roll them in eggs and crumbs, fry in fat a nice 
brown ; serve with onion sauce, with a little lemon and tomato 
catsup boiled in. 

STEWED TRIPE. 

Choose the thickest and whitest tripe, cut the white part into thin 
slices, and put them into a stewpan with a little white gravy, a 
spoonful of vinegar, a little lemon juice, and a little grated lemon 
peel. Add the yolk of an egg well beaten, with a little cream and 
chopped parsley, and two or three chives. Shake them together 
over a slow fire until the gravy is as thick as cream, but do not let 
it boil. Serve it with sippets, and garnish, if desired, with sliced 
lemon. 

BRAWN. 

Take the lower half of a pig's face, the feet and ears, rub them 
well with salt, let them remain so a week or ten days. Salt a 
beef tongue the same way, for the same time. Then let the face, 
ears, and feet boil half an hour in water enough to cover them ; 
take them out and clean them thoroughly, then put them back with 
the tongue also, and boil for three hours, or until the meat will slip 
from the bones. Then take it off, remove the bone, cut the meat in 
small pieces, the tongue into thin slices ; mix all together and sea- 
son with plenty of pepper, a little ground allspice, &c. Then put 



SECONDARY MEATS. 63 

it into a mold in layers of fat and lean, press it down with a spoon, 
add a little liquor from the saucepan, put a heavy weight on the 
top, and let it stand till next morning, when it is ready to turn out 
and send to table. It can be sent with a piece of white paper 
fastened round and served, if desired, with a little sauce of mustard 
vinegar, and brown sugar. The beef tongue makes it much 
nicer, though some omit it, ii.i,fbly chopping the pig's tongue with 
the face, ears and feet. 



FISH, 



TO BOIL FISH. 



Clean and rinse the fish, wrap it in a cloth, and place it in the 
kettle with cold water, adding a little salt ; boil slowly but constant- 
ly ; let the water always cover the fish, remove the scum that rises, 
add a little vinegar when nearly done. The fish is done when the 
flesh can be separated from the back bone by running a thin sharp 
knifie in ; be careful not to let the fish be overdone. Drain it dry 
on a sieve, keeping it hot ; lay it on the fish platter carefully, so as 
not to break it. Serve with sauces composed of drawn butter. 
If a fish kettle with strainer is used, the fish need not be wrapped 
in cloth. 

Fresh cod, haddock, whiting and shad, are better for being salt- 
ed the night before cooking them. The muddy smell that is some- 
times noticed in fresh water fish, is obviated by soaking it, after 
cleaning, in strong salt and water ; after which, dry it on a napkin, 
and dress it. 

TO FRY FISH. 

Cleanse them thoroughly, dry them well, dip them in flour, or 
first in the beaten yolks of eggs, and then in grated bread crumbs ; 
fry in lard or beef drippings, or equal parts of lard and butter. 
Butter alone takes out the sweetness, and gives a bad color. Turn 
on both sides, and cook a rich yellow brown. Fried parsley, grated 
horse-radish, or slices of lemon are used as garnish. The fat fried 
from salt pork is good to fry fish in. Some fish can be dipped in 
Indian meal instead of flour, if preferred. Trout and perch should 
not be dipped in Indian meal. 



FISH. 65 

WHITE FISH BROILED. {Lake Superior styU.) 

This Is one of the most delicious of lake fish. Cut it in two pieces 
down through the centre of the back, lay in a pan, and cover with 
cold water, into which you have put a table-spoonful of salt. Let 
it lay for two hours, this makes it firm. Then take it out, wrap it 
in a dry cloth, and let it remain until ready for cooking. Have a nice 
bed of coals, grease your gridiron well, put on a little salt, and 
some pepper. Broil for twenty minutes, or half an hour, accord- 
ing to size, turning it to brown on both sides. It will not break in 
pieces. Serve with white sauce. 

WHITE FISH BOILED. {Lake Superior style.') 

This is a very delicate, and highly esteemed dish. Place the 
fish wliole, in a fish kettle ; cover with cold water, add a table- 
spoonful or more of salt, and let it come to a boil. Ten minutes 
after it boils, will cook it. Take it out carefully, serve with e^g 
sauce, which is white sauce, with a hard boiled egg chopped up 
in it. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Draw the fish into the form of the letter S, by running a thread 
through the tail, centre of the body and head ; or if it is part of a 
fish, fold it in a clean cloth. When bent, cut two or three slant- 
ing gashes on each side, to prevent the skin breaking and disfigur- 
ing the fish. Plunge it in boiling water in which a handful of salt 
to four quarts of water has been mixed, and the scum arising from 
it skimmed off. Put in with the fish, a little horse radish. Boil 
until very well done, about quarter of an hour to every pound of 
fish ; and serve with lobster, or white parsley sauce ; garnish with 
sliced lemon. For vegetables, mashed potatoes, and cucumbers 
sliced in vinegar, can be served. A salmon should be chosen for 
its brightness of color, complete covering of scales, firmness of 
flesh, whitness of the belly, brightness of the eye, and redness of 
the scales. Artificial means, it is said, are sometimes adopted to 
give redness to the gills of salmon and other fish, to deceive in- 
experienced buyers. 



FISH. 



BROILED SALMON. 



Aboui an inch, is the proper thickness to cut the slices ; dry 
them with a cloth, put salt on them, and lay them skin side down, 
on a gridiron over hot coals. Before laying on the fish, rub the 
bars with lard, to prevent them sticking. When broiled suffici- 
ently on one side, turn the fish, by laying a plate upon it and 
turning the gridiron over ; then slip the salmon from the plate on 
to the gridiron. This prevents its breaking. 

S.iLMON AND SALAD. 

The remains of boiled salmon, instead of being pickled, as is 
usually done ; are very good sent to table cold, to be eaten with 
salad. Trim the fish neatly, ornament it with sprigs of parsley, 
and serve with a bowl of salad, made as follows : Boil a cauli- 
flower till about two thirds done ; let it get cold, break it in bunch- 
es, lay them in a dish, and put to it salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. 
This is an excellent dish in hot weather. 

TO KIPPER SALMON. 

Lay the fish on its side and cut it from tail to head, taking care 
not to injure the belly by inserting the knife too far ; wash the fish 
well, take out the eyes, and put a pinch of salt in their place ; then 
sprinkle a handful or two of brown sugar over the inside, and 
above the sugar the same quantity, or rather more, of common 
salt ; lay the salmon on a flat board, the inside up ; cover with a 
cloth and let it remain twenty-four hours (or if wished saltish, 
thirty-six) in a dry place, neither too hot nor too cold. If the weath- 
er is fine, an hour or two of exposure to the sun and air will accel- 
erate the curing process. The kipper is in perfection after it has 
been dried twenty-four hours, but it will keep a considerable time. 
To cook it, cut it in slices, wrap each in a piece of paper and fry 
it ; send it to the table in paper. 

PICKLED SALMON. 

Scald, clean, and split the salmon ; then cut into pieces and lay 
them on the bottom of the kettle, with an equal quantity of water 
and vinegar, enough to cover them ; put in salt, pepper, six blades 



FISH. 67 

of mace, twelve bay leaves. When the salmon has boiled enough, 
drain and lay it on a cloth, put more salmon into the kettle and 
boil ; continue doing this till all is done. "When all is cold, pack 
the fish, and cover with pickle ; place something heavy upon the 
fish to keep it down, that it may be covered entirely with the pickle, 
which must be occasionally poured off and scalded. Cover it close- 
ly to keep it from the air. 

BROILED SHAD. 

Shad should be baked, fried or broiled. For broiling, remove 
the roes, clean and dry thoroughly, cut into straight halves, and 
lay with the roes on a well-heated and well-greased gridiron, over 
a moderate fire ; put the cover on so that it will cook through while it 
is browning, and only turn once ; when it is done remove it to a 
warm dish, spread over a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a 
little pepper and salt, and put it, for a moment, in the oven ; gar- 
nish with sprigs of fresh parsley before serving. 

FRIED SHAD. 

Divide the two halves In pieces two or three inches wide, salt and 
pepper them and put them in a pan, In which the fat, to keep them 
from sticking, has already been made boiling hot ; fry a rich brown 
on both sides, cooking the Inside first, and serve hot. The roes 
may be fried in the same way. 

BAKED SHAD 

Baked shad does not require to be cut down the back ; only 
cleaned, the roes removed, and the inside filled with a stuffing 
made of bread crumbs, salt pork, an onion, sage, thyme, parsley, 
and pepper and salt ; chop all together fine, fill and sew up the 
shad, and place in a pan with three or four slices of the pork over 
it, and the roes at the side ; bake one hour, and you will have a 
dish fit for an editor. 

SHAD RLUTRE d'hOTEL. 

Butter a pan and lay the shad in it, with an onion sliced, a bay 
leaf, five cloves, the juice of half a lemon, a spoonful of vinegar, 
and two of gravy ; make four or five incisions on both sides of the 



68 MEATS. 

shad, cutting down to the bone, cover with buttered paper, and 
put into a rather slow oven ; let it bake twenty minutes, then take 
it out, remove the paper, baste thoroughly and put it back ; let it 
remain in the oven altogether about three quarters of an hour, or 
an hour if the fish is a large one, basting frequently with the liquor 
in the pan ; then take it out, fill the incisions with chopped parsley 
and butter, and put back, while making a sauce of a little butter, 
flour, broth, and lemon juice, into which pour all the liquid sur- 
rounding the shad ; boil up once, dish the fish, and pour the sauce 
over it. 

FRESH MACKEREL. 

This is a Spring luxury. Purchased in the city they are already 
cleaned, and require only to be rolled in a clean cloth, put in cold 
water, and cooked for five minutes, after coming to a boil ; serve 
with parsley sauce, made with a table-spoonful of flour, mixed 
smooth with cold milk, and a piece of butter the size of a small 
egg ; garnish with green parsley, and eat with stewed gooseberries. 

SOUSED MACKEREL. 

Take fresh mackerel, well cleaned, and boil them for a few min- 
utes, or until tender, in salt and water. Take of the water in which 
they were boiled, half as much as will cover them ; add the same 
amount of good vinegar, some whole pepper, cloves, and a blade 
or two of mace. Pour over hot. In twelve hours it will be ready 
for use. Shad is very nice soused in the same way. 

BOILED BASS, ROCK FISH, ETC. 

These should be boiled plain, leaving on the head and tail. Let 
them boil steadily half an hour, serve with drawn butter mixed 
with finely chopped eggs, which have been boiled three quarters of 
an hour. 

PICKED UP CODFISH AND POTATOES. 

This is as old and esteemed a dish as pork and beans. Put 
your salted codfish in soak the night before ; pick it off in shreds 
the next morning, and scald it in a saucepan, pouring off the wa- 
ter just before it comes to a boil ; this will freshen it sufliciently. 



FISH. 69 

Put in then a little more water, a small piece of butter, and a 
few shakes of pepper, and let it cook till it is tender. When it is 
done, thicken it with a beaten egg, but don't allow it to boil ; and 
mix it with double its bulk in potatoes, mashed finely with milk, 
and season with pepper and a little salt. Pile up as near like a 
haystack as possible, pour over the whole some good egg sauce, 
and garnish with parsley and egg rings. 

BAKED COD, BLACK FISH, HADDOCK, ETC. 

Spread little slices of bread with butter ; pepper and salt them 
and lay them inside the fish. Then take a needle and thread and 
sew it up. Put a small skewer through the lip and tail, and fasten 
them together with a piece of twine. Lay it into a dish, in which it 
it may be served ; put two or three thin slices of salt pork upon it, 
sprinkle salt over it, and flour it well. Baste it several times with the 
liquor which cooks out of it. A fish weighing four pounds will cook 
m an hour. 

BROILED WHITINGS. 

Make a brine with salt and water, sprigs of parsley, shallots and 
onions, and let the whole boil together for half an hour; strain it 
and boil the whitings in it, adding a third part of milk. Drain them 
when done, and make the following sauce for them : A piece of 
butter, some flour, two whole green shallots, pepper, and salt. 
Thicken this with cream ; take out the shallots, and pour the sauce 
over the whitings. 

WATER SOUGHT, OR SOODJEE. 

This mode of dressing fish may be used for soles, flounders, and 
also fresh water fish of almost any description. The fish should be 
thoroughly cleansed and put into a stew-pan, with sufficient cold 
water for broth, a very small quantity of white wine vinegar, and 
some salt. While boiling they must be carefully skimmed ; and 
when thoroughly done, served in the liquor in which they were 
boiled ; to which should be added some roots of parsley, cut, 
trimmed, and boiled. A few parsley leaves, boiled to a nice 
green, should be strewed over the fish, and bread and butter sent 
up to eat with the souchy. 



70 FISH. 



FRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size as to help at table ; wash and 
wipe thera dry, roll them in Indian meal. Fry some pieces of salt 
pork ; take out the pork, and put into the frying-pan some lard ; 
when it is quite hot put in the fish and fry it a light brown ; dish it 
with the fried pork, serve with drawn butter. 

COD OR SALMON CUTLETS. 

To one and a half pounds of cold boiled fish, put half a pound 
of cold potatoes, half a pound of butter ; pepper, salt, and a little 
mace, and some anchovy sauce. Pound all these together in a 
mortar, thoroughly. When well beaten, make the mixture into 
the shape of small cutlets, dip thera in egg and bread crumbs, and 
Iry them until they are of a light brown color. They are excellent 
as a side dish or entree. 

FISH ROES IN CASES. 

Put the soft roes from half a dozen broiled mackerel or shad 
into paper cases, with shred parsley, a little rasped bread, butter, 
salt, and pepper. Bake them, and serve them up with lemon juice 
squeezed over them. 

SMALL FISH FRICASSEED. 

Fry the fish a nice brown color, and drain them. Take another 
small fish, remove all the meat from it, and chop it fine, mixing 
with it a little grated bread, some lemon peel, chopped parsley, 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, the yolks of an egg, and a little butter ; 
make this up into small balls and fry them. Into some good gravy 
thickened with flour, put some red wine, and boil it up adding 
cayenne pepper, catsup, and lemon juice ; place the fish and balls 
in it, simmer them a few moments, and serve, garnished with 
lemon. 

TRENTON FALLS FRY. 

Let some small fish soak in the juice of two lemons, with salt, 
pepper, and chopped sweet herbs. After taking them out, drain 
them, and stuff them with crumbs of bread, boiled in milk, and 



FISH. 71 

beat up Tvith the yolks of two eggs ; then sprinkle them with flour, 
and fry them of a good color. Serve them up on fried parsley. 
They should be very dry and crisp. 

FISH AND MACARONI 

Rub the inside of a mold with fresh butter, and strew grated 
cheese at the bottom of it to the thickness of about an inch ; then 
put in a layer of macaroni of about the same thicknfess. Upon 
this lay some fish of whatever kind preferred, boned, cut in pieces, 
and strewed with parsley, thyme, and shallots finely chopped ; also 
some pounded spices and cayenne pepper, adding another layer of 
macaroni and cheese. Bake it for an hour in a moderate oven, 
carefully turn it out into a dish, and serve it up with a little good 
stock gravy round it. 

FISH AXD MACARONI. 

Boil the macaroni in water until tender, drain it, and cut it into 
short pieces. Remove the bones and skin from any kind of white 
boiled fish, tear it into small pieces, and mix it with the macaroni. 
Then make a sauce of two ounces of butter, the yolks of one or 
two eggs, salt, pepper and a little lemon juice. Heat this in a 
sauce-pan, pouring in half a pint of good melted butter, stir it, and 
put in the fish and macaroni. When hot, pour it out in a dish, 
heaping it in the centre ; sprinkle fine bread crumbs over it and 
bake the top a light brown color in the oven. 

FRIED SMELTS. 

Split them just far enough to clean them ; lay them in salt and 
water, and let them remain an hour ; then wash and wipe them, 
have ready two eggs beat up in a plate, and some cracker crumbs 
in another plate ; put about two pounds of lard into the frying 
pan ; set it on the fire until it is very hot ; dip the smelts into the 
eggs, roll them in the crumbs, and put them into the boiling fat ; 
fry them a light brown ; serve them hot, with drawn butter. 

FRESH HERRINGS 

These can be broiled or fried. After scaling and cleaning them 
nicely, split them quite open, wash the insides with care, dry them 



72 FISH. 

in a cloth, remove the head, tail and back bones, rub the insides 
with pepper, salt, and a little pounded mace ; stick small bits of 
butter on them ; skewer two of the fish together as flat as possible, 
the skin of both outside ; flour and boil them in twenty to twenty- 
five minutes, or fry them about ten minutes, until brown ; and serve 
■with melted butter mixed with a tea-spoonful of mustard, some salt, 
and a little vinegar or lemon juice . 

TO DRESS FISH A SECOND TIME. 

Put four table spoonsful of bread crumbs to a small quantity of 
fish ; add two eggs, two ounces of butter, a little essence of ancho- 
vy, and a little pepper, salt and cayenne. Mix these all well with 
the fish, which should previously be taken from the bones, and steam 
it until it is heated through. Any cold boiled fish may be dressed 
this way. 

FISH PUDDING. 

Take cold boiled fish, the part that is white, and mashed pota- 
toes, an equal quantity ; mix well together, breaking the fish very 
fine ; add two ounces of melted butter, or cream instead of the 
butter ; season with salt and pepper. Butter a pudding dish, put 
the mixture in, keeping the top rough, and put it in the oven till 
heated through, and the top nicely browned. 

CHOWDER. 

For a capital Spring chowder, put a layer of fresh fish, cod, or 
haddock ; then a layer of split crackers, sliced onions, and raw 
potatoes sliced very thin ; strew a little salt and pepper over this 
layer ; then put in more pork and fish, crackers, onions, and pota- 
toes, and so on, until the ingredients are exhausted ; over this 
mixture pour a bowl of liquid, composed of two table-spoons of 
flour, mixed smooth with milk and water ; add milk and water to 
the flour until there is sufficient to just cover the contents of the 
pot ; cover down tight, and cook slowly two or three hours. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

Pare, and cut into slices, seven or eight potatoes, and put them 
in a basin of cold water ; cut a fresh cod into slices, then fry a 



FISH. 73 

few slices of fat salt pork ; lay the pork in the bottom of the stew 
kettle ; place two or three slices of fish on it, then a layer of split 
crackers, then some potatoes, and so on, with alternate layers, 
until the kettle is fall ; put in a little pepper and salt. Put in a 
quart of water ; mix one table-spoonful of flour, in half a pint of 
water, and pour in, after it begins to stew. Cover very tight, and 
stew three hours. 

FISH CAKES. 

Mix together a pound and a half of mashed potatoes, a pound 
of cold boiled fish, either salt or fresh ; add a little milk and butter, 
one egg if desired ; pepper, onions, and a Uttle chopped thyme, 
and salt if the fish requires it ; sprinkle on a little flour, and fry 
them a light brown in small, thick cakes. 

STEWED SALT COD. 

Soak and scald the fish until suflSciently freshened ; pick it into 
shreds, and stew it with milk to moisten it, a little butter rolled in 
flour, and pepper to taste. Stew gently a few minutes, and serve 
hot. 

CAPE COD CHOWDER. 

Fry some slices of sweet, salt pork till they are crisp ; pour off 
part of the fat ; take out the rashers and set them aside, where 
they will keep hot. Put in a layer of potatoes first, with a little 
onion, then pepper, then a layer of butter crackers, then a layer 
of fish, then a little more fat, more potatoes, more onion, more 
pepper, more butter crackers, more fish, and so on until the ket- 
tle is two thirds full ; then put on top whatever fat may be left ; 
fill up with water, cover close, and let it cook an hour or an hour 
and a half, according to quantity. A little salt may be required. 
Serve with the rashers placed round the dish on toast and pickle. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

This is made in the same way, only they require a great deal 
of pork, and be careful to get soft shell clams. 

SALT CODFISH AND POTATOES. 

Soak a thick piece of fish over night, pour out the water and

cover it •with fresh, lukewarm water, and let it stand a short time ; 
then put it in lukewarm water over the fire and let it simmer, but 
not boil, for an hour and a half or two hours, until it is done ; re- 
move the skin ; serve with drawn butter or egg sauce, with whole 
boiled potatoes to be mashed or cut bv each person with the fish, 
on their own plate. Serve also, if convenient, cucumbers in vin- 
egar, pickles or nasturtiums. The fish can be garnished with hard 
boiled eggs. The cold fish left, will make a fine hash, or may be 
prepared in fish cakes. 



SHELL FISH, EELS, Etc. 



OYSTERS ETIQUETTE. 



Procure two dozen oysters. Have them opened, and throw 
them into a clean basin or soup plate. Take a small bunch of 
parsley, chopped quite small, a little raw lemon rind ditto, half a 
nutmeg grated, and the crumb of a stale French roll, also grated. 
Let the latter be well mixed together, adding one drachm of cay- 
enne pepper. Have at hand the yolks of three fresh eggs, beaten 
up into a fluid ; dip the oysters separately into the eggs, and roll 
them in the crumb of the loaf until they are all encased in a bread 
coating or covering. Put a quarter of a pound of good butter into 
the oven, with a brisk fire, until the former is fully melted, arranging ■ 
your oysters on the tray of the oven at your convenience. Keep 
the oysters continually turned until they assume a perfectly brown, 
crusty appearance. When fully baked, serve them up with a 
plate of bread and butter, cut thin, and use salt at discretion. A 
stick of celery eaten with them, adds greatly to the relish which the 
fish impart when served in this way. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Boil up the oysters in their own liquor, with a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, and pepper and salt to taste. Have ready a 
pint or more of rich boiled milk, the quantity according to the 
number of oysters. Pour it hot into the soup tureen, and as the 
oysters come to a boil, skim them, let them boil up once, and then 
pour them into the milk. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters ; pound very fine 
eight soft crackers, or grate a stale loaf of bread ; butter a deep 



76 SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 

dish, sprinkle in a layer of crumbs, then a layer of oysters, a little 
mace, pepper, and bits of butter ; another layer of crumbs, an- 
other of oysters, then seasoning as before, and so on until the dish 
is filled ; cover the dish over with bread crumbs, seasoning as 
before ; turn over it a cup of the oyster liquor. Set it in the oven 
for thirty or forty minutes to brown. This is an excellent way to 
prepare oysters for a family dinner. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Select fine, large oysters, dry them out of their own liquor. 
Have ready a plate of egg, and a plate of bread crumbs. Let 
them lay in the egg a few minutes, and then roll them in the 
bread crumbs, allowing them to remain in these also, for a minute 
or two ; this will make them adhere, and not come off as a skin, 
when in the pan. Fry in half butter and half lard, in order to 
give them a rich brown. Make it very hot before putting the oys- 
ters in. 

OYSTER PIES. 

Take a deep dish, cover it with puff paste, lay an extra layer 
around the edge of the dish, put in the oven and bake nicely. 
When done, fill the pie with oysters ; season with butter, salt, and 
pepper, sprinkle a little flour over them and cover with a thin crust 
of puff paste ; bake quickly ; when the top crust is done, the oys- 
ters should be. Serve immediately. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Beard the oysters, and, if large, halve them ; put them into a 
saucepan with a piece of butter rolled in flour, some finely shred 
lemon rind, and a little white pepper, and milk, and a portion of 
the liquor from the fish ; stir all well together, let it simmer for a 
few minutes, and put it in your patty pans, which should be al- 
ready prepared with a puff paste in the usual way. Serve hot or 
cold. 

OYSTER LOAVES. 

Cut out a piece of the size of a quarter of a dollar from the top 
of half a dozen buns, scoop out most of the crumb, put a portion 
of the latter with a good bit of butter, and about two dozen fresh 



SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 77 

oysters into a frying pan and fry all together for five minutes, add 
a little cream or milk and seasoning. Then fill the loaves, allow- 
ing four oysters to each ; replace the pieces of crust on the tops, 
butter the outsides. and place them for a short time in an oven to 
get crisp. Serve them hot or cold. 

OYSTERS AND MACARONI. 

Slowly stew some macaroni in good gravy till quite tender ; 
(hen lay it in a pie dish, put in a good layer of fresh oysters, beard- 
ed ; add pepper, salt, a little grated lemon rind, and a tea-spoon- 
ful of cream, or olive oil if preferred. Strew bread crumbs over, 
and just brown it in a tolerably brisk oven. Serve with plenty of 
lemon juice, or a sauce piqiiante. 

OYSTERS FOR LUNCH. 

Take a fine oyster, wrap it thinly with bacon, fastening it with 
a little skewer. Lay it on a piece of toast, and put into a Dutch 
oven or a hot stove oven, a very little time. Prepare as many in 
this way as desired. •^ 

PICKLED OYSTERS. — No 1. " 

Wash fifty large oysters in their own liquor ; wipe them dry, 
strain the liquor off, add to it a dessert-spoonful of pepper, the 
same of mace, the same of salt, the same of whole cloves, and a 
pint of vinegar. Let the oysters come to a boil in the liquor, then 
drain them off with a skimmer ; put them into a jar ; boil the pickle 
up, skim it, and when it is cold, pour over the oysters. They will 
be ready for use in twenty-four hours. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. — ^No. 2. 

Put the oysters, say two hundred, with their juice, into a large 
saucepan on the fire ; let them simmer, but not boil, until the edges 
curl, and they become solid, but not shriveled. Be careful about 
this. Strain off the juice, and wipe the oysters with a nice, clean 
cloth. Let the juice settle, then pour off about a quart, leaving 
the sediment undisturbed ; to this clear juice add one pint white 
wine, or other vinegar, a little mace, two dozen cloves, and a 
handful of black peppers. Heat it over the fire, but don't let it 



78 SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 

boil ; pour it while hot, over the oysters. Put them in a stone 
jar, and in two days they will be very nice for use. 

STEWED MUSCLES. 

Open the muscles in their own liquor. When ready for use 
drain off the liquor and wash them in clear water. Then add to 
the liquor, or as much of it as is needed, an equal amount of water 
and of white wine, a blade of mace and a little whole pepper ; boil 
them, and after awhile drop in the muscles, letting them just boil 
up, and thicken them with a piece of butter and flour. They can 
be served with sippets of bread and the liquor. 

FRIED EELS. 

After the eels have been skinned and cleaned, split them open 
and cut them in short pieces. Then make a pickle of vinegar, 
lemon juice, sliced onion, salt and pepper ; place the eels in it and 
let them lie two or three hours. Roll them in flouf and fry in lard 
or clarified butter. Place them on the table dry, with fried pars- 
ley, using plain butter for sauce. 

SPATCIIED EELS. 

Take two pounds of eels, scour their skins with sand and salt, 
wipe them dry with flannel, gut them, cut them into short pieces, 
saturate them with the beaten yolk of an egg, and then roll into a 
plate containing crumbs of the inside of stale bread, chopped 
parsley, a sprig of sweet marjoram, a sprig of bruised anchovy, half 
a nutmeg grated, and some cayenne pepper, and salt all mixed. 
When well rubbed in these, baste them before a clear bright fire, 
with plenty of butter, until they are covered with a brown crust. 
Serve them with plain or melted butter for sauce. 

COLLARED EELS. 

Select a large eel, gut it and bone it without skinning it, and 
rub the inside with salt, pepper, mace, allspice, powdered cloves, 
chopped sage. Parsley, thyme, savory and knotted marjoram 
also improve the taste. Roll it tight, tie it, and boil it well in salt 
water. Then add vinegar, and when cold keep it in pickle. 



SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 79 



STEWED EELS. 

Wash the eels well, and cut into pieces two or three inches long. 
Place them in the pan with an onion, cloves, a bundle of sweet 
herbs, a blade of mace, some whole pepper in a muslin rag, and 
add enough water for sauce. Let them stew softly, and add the 
juice of half a lemon, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. When 
they are tender, take out the onion, cloves, herbs, mace, and pep- 
per, put in sufficient salt to season, and serve it with the sauce. 

BOILED EELS. 

Boil them in a little water with some parsley until tender, sea- 
son them properly, and serve them with the liquor and the parsley. 
Use chopped parsley and butter for sauce. 

EEL PEE. 

Cut up the eels in one or two inch lengths, line the dish with 
potato paste, such as used for meat pies ; put in the eels, season 
with pepper, salt, parsley, and a little butter. Pour over a little 
stock, or a few spoonsful of gravy, a spoonful of mushroom catsup, 
and dredge with flour. Cover with potato paste, and bake an 
hour and a quarter. This is for family use ; if company is expect- 
ed, a richer paste may be used. 

LOBSTERS. 

To choose lobsters that are boiled, select those that are heaviest, 
and of a middling size ; if they are fresh the tail will flap back with 
a springy motion, when raised up. 

TO BOIL A FRESH LOBSTER. 

Put it into a fish kettle of boiling water, into which a handful 
of salt has been thrown ; boil it briskly for half an hour, then wipe 
off the skum, and rub over it a little sweet oil. When cold, break 
off the claws, and crack the shell, but do not disturb the meat ; 
set the body upright in the dish, with the claws and tail around it. 

MRS. MAJOR D.'s LOBSTER SALAD. 

Boil the lobster about half an hour. When it is cold, take it 



80 SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 

from the shell, being careful to take out the vein in the back. To 
six lbs of lobster, take two heads of salad, one cup of melted 
butter ; two table-spoons of mustard, mixed with a little vinegar. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Chop these together, and spread on a 
flat dish. Then beat six eggs, and mix with half a pint of vine- 
gar. Put this on the stove to thicken, stirring constantly : when 
cold spread it over the lobster. 
For another receipt, see *' Salads." 

CRABS AND CRAYFISH. 

These are boiled in the same manner as lobsters. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Mash the ft-esh eggs of a hen lobster ; strain, and reserve ; di- 
vide the flesh into small pieces, dust it with flour to prevent it ad- 
hering together, and put it into a white sauce, allowing it to simmer 
for a minute, before puttmg in the eggs ; when these have been 
added, it will assume a brilliant red, and should be removed from 
the fire instantly, before it has time to darken. Such flavor as 
anchovy, or lemon, may be added at the table. 

CRAB AND LOBSTER CUTLETS. 

Take out the meat of either a large lobster, or crab, mince it, 
and add two ounces of butter browned with two spoonfiils of flour, 
and seasoned with a little pepper, salt, and cayenne ; add again 
about half a pint of strong stock, stir the mixture over the fire 
until quite hot, lay it in separate table-spoonsful on a large dish. 
When they are cold, form them into the shape of cutlets, brush 
them over with the beaten yolk of an egg ; dip them into grated 
bread crumbs, fry them of a light brown color in clarified beef drip- 
ping, and place them round a dish, with a little fried parsley in the 
centre. 

LOBSTER BALLS. 

Mince the meat with the coral, season, make it in balls mixed 
with bread crumbs and butter, dip them with the yolk of an egg 
and flour if desired, and fry them brown in hot lard ; for lobster 
patties, place minced lobster in the shell in puff paste, and bake. 



SHELL FISH, EELS, ETC. 81 



LOBSTER CURRY. 



Put the meat of a large lobster into a stew-pan with a blade of 
mace, a large cup of veal stock or gravy, and a table-spoonful of 
com starch, mixed smooth with a little milk, or cream. Add salt, 
a small piece of butter, a dessert-spoonful of curry powder, and 
the juice of half a lemon ; simmer for an hour, and serve. 



MUSHROOMS. 



HOW TO KNOW MUSHROOMS. 

To know the mushroom from the poisonous toadstool, observe 
the mushroom has no bad smell, that its top skin will readily peel 
off; there is a thick meat between the skin and the red gills or 
plates ; the gills are of a pinkish or rosy hue, though turning 
brownish by age, but are never of the lurid brown of the toad- 
stool ; when sprinkled with salt and allowed to stand, the mush- 
room gives out juice, the toadstool becomes dry and leathery. 

MUSHROOM FRICASSEE. 

Put a quart of fresh mushrooms, cleaned, into a saucepan, with 
three spoonsful of water, three of milk, and a little salt, and set 
them on a quick fire. Let them boil up three times, after which 
take them off and mix in half a pint of milk, a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, and a little grated nutmeg. Put them into the 
saucepan, shaking it well occasionally, and when the liquor is thick, 
stirring them carefully in the saucepan with a spoon, all the time, 
and seeing that they do not curdle. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 

Wash half a peck of large mushrooms quite clean from grit, 
and cut off the stalks. Put them in a saucepan, without water, 
containing a quarter of an ounce of mace, two spoonsful of pound- 
ed pepper, two onions stuck with cloves, a handful of salt, some 
allspice and nutmeg, if liked, and a quarter of a pound of butter. 
Let this stew till the liquor is dried up, then place them on sieves 
until they are sufficiently dry to be beaten to a powder. Bottle 
this and closely cork it. To give a good flavor to soup or gravy, 



MUSHROOMS. 83 

a tea-spoonful of the powder must be added a minute or two before 
it is taken from the fire. 

MUSHROOM POWDER.— 2. 

Wipe the mushrooms clean and pare the skin from the large 
ones. Put them on paper, and place them in a cool oven to dry. 
Lay them before the fire until crisp, then grind and sift them 
through a fine sieve, and keep the powder in small closely corked 
bottles. 

MUSHROOM LOAVES. 

Well wash some small button mushrooms, such as are generally 
used for pickling, and boil them for a few minutes in a very little 
water. Add to them a small quantity of cream, a piece of butter 
rolled in some flour, salt and pepper, then boil up all together 
again. Cut off a piece from the end of some rolls, scoop out the 
crumb ; in its place put the prepared mushrooms, and replace the 
end of each roll. 

MUSHROOM TOAST. 

Remove the stems, and red inside, and skins, from a pint of 
freshly gathered mushrooms. Dissolve a little butter in a stew- 
pan, throw in the mushrooms, season with cayenne pepper, and 
toss them over the fire for about ten minutes ; add a tea-spoonful 
of flour, and stir until all is slightly browned. Cut a crust about 
an inch thick from the under part of a loaf: scoop it out in the 
centre ; butter it, and boil it over a brisk fire ; then place it upon 
a hot dish before the fire. Pour in by degrees a tea-cupful of 
cream or new milk to the mushrooms ; flavor with a few drops of 
catsup ; stew gently for two minutes, and pour them into the crust. 
Serve hot. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS. 

Choose large button mushrooms, wipe them with a wet flannel, 
and put them into a stew-pan with a little water. Let them stew 
gently for a quarter of an hour ; then put in a pinch of salt, work 
a little flour and butter to make it as thick as cream. Let it boil 
for five minutes, and before dishing it up, add two large table- 



84 MUSHROOMS. 

spoonsful of cream mixed with the yolk of one egg. Shake the 
sauce-pan over the fire for a minute or so, to warm the contents, 
but do not allow them to boil, for fear they might curdle. Put 
some sippets around the inside of the dish, and serve hot. £For 
pickled mushrooms, see Pickles.] 



FOWLS AND GAME. 



ROAST tuk: 

Have a stuffing prepared of bread crumbs, sausage meat, or 
sweet salt pork, chopped fine, thyme, summer savory, and one 
onion; with pepper, and salt in about equal proportions. If the 
liver and heart are not used with the gizzard, to make the gravy, 
they also may be chopped, and mixed with the stuffing. Fill the 
body, sew up the opening, truss it, and if you choose, place a ring 
of sausages round the neck of the turkey. Put in the pan with a 
cup of hot water ; roast slowly at first, and baste frequently ; if 
there is danger of scorching, cover the breast with white paper. 
It will require, if of good size, two and a half to three hours to 
roast ; and should be served with a rich brown gravy, and with the 
sausages browned and lying on the breast. If sausages are not 
liked, thin slices of sweet salt pork should be laid over the breast, 
and round the neck. 

BOILED FOWL. 

Boil the liver, gizzard, heart and lower part of the legs, in a very 
little water, chop them fine, mix them with drawn butter and 
bread crumbs, and season with salt, summer savory, and a little 
pepper. Stuff the fowl with this ; put it in sufficient water to cover 
it well, and stew it gently until tender ; serve with drawn butter. 

ROAST DUCKS. 

Clean and truss them nicely, and fill their bodies with a stuffing 
made of half mashed potatoes, and half sage, and onions, well 



86 FOWLS AND GAME. 

seasoned with pepper and salt. Baste them with slices of sweet 
fat pork in the pan, and baste frequently. Make a rich gravy, 
into which put a table-spoonsful of Worcestershire sauce. Serve 
with apple sapce. 

For a change one of a pair of ducks may be stuffed with prunes. 

ROAST FOWL. 

The fowl being drawn, and prepared, fill the body with a dress- 
ing of bread and butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, and summer 
savory ; sew up the opening, truss it, oil it with butter, roast it 
rather fast without scorching, the first half hour, heating all sides 
evenly ; baste it all over every five minutes, and after that, roast 
rather slowly three quarters of an hour or more, until the fowl is 
done through. If not sufficiently browned, wet it over with a little 
yolk of egg, sprinkle it with flour, and let it stand a little longer, 
till browned evenly. 

BOILED FOWL. 

Divide the fowl at the back, lay the sides open, and skewer the 
wings as for roasting. Boil over a clear fire, seasoning with pepper, 
salt, and a little butter. Serve them immediately, on a hot dish. 

MR. DEMOREST's chicken FRICASSEE. 

Prepare a couple of nice plump chickens ; joint them , dividing 
the wings, side, breast, and backbones, and let them lie in clear 
water half an hour ; remove them then to a stew-pan, with half a 
pound of good, sweet salt pork cut up in pieces ; barely cover with 
water, and simmer on the top of the stove or range for three 
hours ; when sufficiently tender, take out the chicken, mix a table- 
spoonful of flour smoothly with cold milk, and add a little fine 
dried or chopped parsley, sage, and thyme, or summer savory, and 
stir gradually into the liquor ; keep stirring till it boils ; season 
v/ith pepper and salt to taste ; and then put back the chicken and 
let it boil up for a few moments in the gravy; garnish with' the 
green tops of celery. 

BOILED GOOSE. 

Dress and singe it, put it into a deep dish, cover it with boiling 



FOWLS AND GAME. 87 

milk and leave It all night. In the morning wash off the milk and 
put the goose into cold water on the fire ; when boiling hot take it 
'off, wash it in warm water, and dry it with a cloth. This process 
takes out the taste of oil. Fill the body with a dressing of bread 
crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, and butter, two chopped onions, 
if relished, and a little sage, and close it. Put it into cold water 
and boil gently until tender, about an hour. Serve with giblet 
sauce, and with pickles, or acid jellies. For vegetables have beets, 
turnips and cauliflower. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Make a dressing of two ounces of onion, an ounce of green 
sage chopped fine, a coffee cup of bread crumbs, a little pepper, 
and salt; do not quite fill the goose, but leave room to swell. 
The yolks of two eggs can be added to the dressing, if desired. 
Roast two hours or less, and serve with gravy and apple sauce. 

DUCK, WITH GREEN PEAS. 

Roast a duck until about half done. Place it into a stew-pan, 
with a pint of good gravy, and a very little sage ; cover it close, 
and let the duck continue to simmer in the pan, for half an hour ; 
then put in a pint of boiled green peas ; the peas are put in the 
pan to thicken the gravy. Place the duck on a dish, and pour the 
gravy and peas over it. 

NEW YORK MOCK DUCK. 

Procure a good rump steak, fill it with duck stuflSng, bread, a 
little sweet salt pork, sage, chopped onions, and pepper, and salt ; 
roll it up, skewer the ends tight ; tie a string round the middle, and 
simmer with a little stock, in a covered pan, for two hours ; take it 
out, put in the oven, and bake for another hour without cover. 

TURKEY STEWED WITH CELERY. 

Choose a fine hen-turkey, and stuff it with some force meat as 
for veal, viz : four ounces of bread crumbs, the grated rind of 
half a lemon, a quarter of an ounce of savory herbs, minced fine, 
salt and pepper, two ounces of butter, and the yolk of an egg. 
All these ingredients to be well mLxed together. Skewer the 



88 FOWLS AND GAME. 

turkey as for boiling, and put it into a large sauce-pan filled with 
water, and let it boil until tender. Take up the turkey and put it 
into another sauce-pan, with sufficient of the water in which it has 
been boiled, to keep it hot. Wash well about four good sized 
heads of celery, put these into the sauce-pan with the rest of the 
water in which the turkey has been boiled, and stew them until 
tender. Take them out and put in the turkey, breast downward, 
and let it stew for a quarter of an hour ; place it on a hot dish be- 
fore the fire, thicken the sauce with butter and flour, and a break- 
fast-cup of cream ; put it in the celery to warm, and pour the 
sauce and celery hot over the turkey. 

STEWED CHICKEN. 

Divide a chicken into pieces by the joints, and -put into a stew- 
pan, with salt, pepper, some parsley, and thyme ; pour in a quart 
of water, with a piece of butter ; and when it has stewed an hour 
and a half, take the chicken out of the pan. If there is no gravy, 
put in another piece of butter, add some water, and flour, and let 
it boil a few minutes. When done, it should be not quite as thick 
as drawn butter. 

COLD CHICKEN FRIED. 

Place the cold chicken, divided into small joints, into a deep 
dish, and cover then with salt, pepper, a little melted butter, the 
juice of a lemon, and some chopped parsley and onion. Let the 
meat soak three or four hours in this, turning it once in a while. 
Then take them out, sprinkle flour over them, and fry them. 
When done, pile them high on a dish, and pour a good gravy sauce, 
seasoned and flavored with sweet herbs , round them. 

VOL-AU-VENT OP CHICKEN. ■ 

Make a case of puff paste, and fill it, when baked, with minced 
chicken, prepared as follows. Take "the meat of a cold chicken, 
and mince it small. Take half a pint of stock, thicken it with a 
little flour, flavor with salt, and nutmeg, and let it boil well ; then 
add two or three mushrooms chopped small, a teacupful of milk, 
and the minced chicken. As soon as the mushrooms are cooked 
the mince is done. This may be served on a dish alone. Or put 



FOWLS AND GAME. 89 

into vol-au-vent cases, and ornamented with a few button mush- 
rooms, stewed in white sauce, on the top. 

CHICKEN WITH CHEESE. {A French dish). 

Braise a couple of chickens, and when nearly done, add to 
them some good stock, vegetables, white wine and butter, season- 
ing according to taste. When done, strain some of the liquor into 
a dish, and grate into it some parmesan cheese ; place the chickens 
in this, pour over them the remainder of the gravy, grate more 
parmesan over them, and bake the whole. 

CHICKEN PUFFS. 

Mince up together the breast of a chicken, some lean ham, half 
an anchovy, a little parsley, some shallot and lemon peel, and sea- 
son these with pepper, salt, cayenne, and beaten mace. Let this 
be on the fire for a few moments, in a little good white sauce. 
Cut some thinly rolled out puff paste into squares, putting on each 
some of the mince ; turn the paste over, fry them in boiling lard, 
and serve them. These puffs are very good cold. 

CHICKEN LOAF. 

Bone a chicken carefully, and fill it with chopped sweetbread 
well seasoned ; make it as nearly as possible into its original form, 
tie it up in bacon, and having wrapped a cloth round it, boil it in 
some white wine, good stock, and sweet herbs. When done, untie 
it, use the bacon as garnish, cut in narrow strips, and serve up with 
some rich sauce. 

CHICKEN POT PIE. 

Divide the chicken into pieces at the joints ; boil until part done, 
or about twenty minutes, then take it out. Fry two or three slices 
of fat salt pork, and put in the bottom, then place the chicken on 
it with three pints of water, two ounces of butter, a tea-spoonful 
of pepper, and cover over the top with a light crust, made the 
same as for biscuit. Cook one hour. 

MRS. MAJOR D.'S CHICKEN PIE, FL^VVORED WITH OYSTERS. 

Cut up a good sized chicken and stew until tender ; meanwhile

seasoning it. After lining the sides of your pan with paste, put 
in it a quart of oysters, seasoning them. Then throw in the 
chicken. Take the water in which the chicken was stewed, and 
thicken it with flour. Fill the pan with the thickened liquor, cover 
it all with paste ; ornament with pastry, and bake till the crust is 
a nice brown, or about twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

PLAIN CHICKEN PIE. 

Take a chicken and cut it in pieces. Stew it in water enough to 
cover it. When tender, line a deep dish with pie crust, take the 
chicken out of the liquor, put it in the dish with three or four slices 
of pork, and two ounces of butter, the latter cut in small pieces ; 
add some of the liquor, flavor with mushroom catsup, and thicken 
with flour. Cover it with pie crust, and bake it in a quick oven 
about an hour. 

THANKSGIVING CHICKEN PIE. 

Cut two chickens into small members as for fricassee ; cover the 
bottom of the pic-dish with layers of veal and ham placed alter- 
nately ; season with chopped mushrooms and parsley, pepper and 
salt, then add a little gravy ; next place in the dish the pieces of 
chicken in neat order, and round these put slices of hard boiled 
egg in each cavity ; repeat the seasoning and the sauce, lay a few 
thin slices of dressed ham neatly trimmed, on the top ; cover the 
pie with puff-paste, ornament this with pieces of the same cut into 
the form of leaves, &c. ; egg the pie over with a paste-brush, and 
bake it for one hour and a half. 

AUNT ABBY'S CHICKEN PIE. 

Joint two plump, tender chickens, stew them half an hour m 
barely enough water to cover them, take them from the liquor, and 
lay them in a deep dish, with some thin slices of very sweet, nice 
salt pork, and a few halves of small butter crackers. Season the 
liquor highly, and pour over the chicken. Have ready a nice top 
crust, and put a rim of it first round the edge of the dish, wet it 
slightly, so that the other edge will stick close, and ornament the 
top with pastry. 

For family use, or to eat cold, for breakfast, or for lunch, put a

pigeons as the dish will contain in one layer ; put into each a slice of 
butter seasoned with a little cayenne and mace ; lay them into the 
dish breast downwards, and between and over them put the yolks of 
half dozen or more boiled eggs ; stick plenty of butter on them, sea- 
son the whole with salt and spice ; pour in cold water or veal broth for

ly together, and afterwards add one spoonftd of anchovy, and one 
of Harvey sauce, a large spoonful of mustard, two of mushroom 
catsup, black pepper, and salt, and three spoonsful of sweet oil. 
Well mix the whole. This makes a nice relish to eat with bread 
and butter. 

SMALL BIRDS. 

Dress them nicely, split them down the back and open them out 
flat, cleaning them well. Broil them gently over a clear fire, sea- 
son them with butter, salt and pepper ; serve them on buttered 
toast with pickles. 

ROAST GROUSE. 

Dress and singe them. Fill the bodies with a stuffing of bread 
crumbs, seasoned only with pepper, salt and butter. Put some 
cold stock or gravy into the pan, and baste frequently ; three

with Harvey, or some other good game sauce, with mashed po- 
tatoes and jelly. 

FORCEMEAT FOR ROAST VEAL, TURKEY, ETC. 

Mix thoroughly four ounces of the crumb of stale bread very 
finely grated ; the grated rind, pared thin, of half a fresh lemon ; 
quarter of an ounce of minced parsley and thyme, one part thyme,

given here may be increased when more is required. The above 
will be sufficient for a middling sized turkey. Forcemeat for 
Ducks or Geese. Two parts of chopped onions, two parts of 
bread crumbs, two of butter, one of pounded sage, and a seasoning 
of pepper and salt.

sauce will keep for two years. 



MEAT SAUCES. 99 



TOMATO SAUCE. — 2. 

Put tomatoes perfectly ripe, into an earthen jar, and set into an 
oven till they are quite soft ; then separate the skins from the pulp, 
and mix this with capsicum vinegar and a few shalots finely chop- 
ped, which will be proportioned to the quantity of fruit. Add pow- 
dered ginger and salt to your taste. Some white wine vinegar and

veal gravy, mixed with the yolks of two eggs, with seasoning of 
salt and cayenne ; or into melted butter into which a little lemon 
juice has been squeezed. 

SAUCE OF TURKEY^S EGGS. 

Turkey's eggs are superior to others for sauce. Boil three eggs 
gently in plenty of water twenty minutes. Break the shells by 
rolling them on the table ; separate the whites from the yolks, di- 
vide all the yolks into quarter inch dice pieces, mince one and a 
half of the whites rather small, mix them lightly and stir them into 
a pint of white sauce, and serve hot. The eggs of common fowl 
may be prepared for sauce according to these directions, using

stirring it well each day. Strain the juice from the fruit, and put- 
ting one pound of sugar to one pint of juice ; boil it gently three 
quarters of an hour ; skim, and when cold, bottle it. 

CHIU VINEGAR. 

Let fifty small, ripe cayenne peppers chopped fine, remain In 
strong vinegar for a fortnight, then strain and bottle. 



RELISHES. 



SANDWICHES. 

Make some nice biscuit which will be three-quarters of an inch 
thick, when baked. Split them, butter them lightly, and lay in a 
slice of tongue, or ham, touched with French mustard or anchovy 
sauce. 

DRESSING FOR SANDWICHES. 

Take three spoonsful of sweet oil, three table-spoonsful of mixed 
mustard, half-a-pound of good butter, a little red pepper, a little 
salt, the yolk of one egg, beat them together smoothly, and keep 
them cool ; then chop together finely some tongue and ham, and if 
convenient, a little cold chicken. Spread the sliced bread with the 
dressing, then with the meat ; add the second slice, press closely 
together and trim off the edges. 

A COLD RELISH. 

Cut odd scraps of meat into small pieces. If there is veal and 
ham among it, so much the better. Add three table-spoonsful of 
farina, some parsley, green or dried, a little sage, a little celery, 
parsnip, or carrot, or all three, chopped fine, and pepper and salt. 
Cover with water, and stew for two hours, very gently. Pour into 
a dish, and when cold it will be solid ; and should be cut in thin 
slices, for the table. 

A GERMAN ENTREMET. 

Boil eight eggs quite hard, and when cold cut them in two length- 
wise. Take the yolks out very carefully, pass them through a fine 
sieve, and mix them well with half a pint of cream (or more if re- 
quired) and then add pepper, salt, and herbs. Pour this sauce 



108 RELISHES. 

into a very flat pie dish that will stand heat, and place the white 
half eggs carefully in it, arranging them in the form of a star, or 
any pattern preferred. Fill up the vacancy left in them by the 
yolks having been removed, with the same mixture, and strew a 
few bread crumbs over them. Bake this very slightly, just enough 
to give it a bright yellow color, and serve it up in the dish' in 
which it has been baked. 

' ' "savory custard. 

Beat two eggs into one and a half gills o£» cream ; season to 
taste with pepper, salt, cayenne, chopped parsley, sweet herbs 
and shallot ; add to these some chopped ham and tongue. Pour it 
into small round cups and steam ten minutes. 

TOMATO TOAST. 

Pare, slice, and cook green tomatoes until very tender. Add 
sweet cream, sweet milk will do, but it will need more butter to 
make plenty of gravy ; season with peper, salt, and butter. Have 
the bread nicely toasted and placed in a deep ditsh, and pour the 
contents of the frj'ing-pan over it. This is an excellent way to 
use up dry slices of bread. 

TOMATO OMELET. 

Peel and chop a quart of tomatoes, simmer them for twenty 
minutes with as much water as will cover them ; chop a few onions 
very fine, throw them in with crumbled bread and a lump of but- 
ter ; when nearly done beat up four eggs, and stir them in a few 
minutes ; salt and pepper to your taste. 

SAVORY TOAST. 

Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a saucepan, a 
dessert-spoonful of mustard, a wine glass of vinegar (that in which 
walnuts have been pickled is superior to all others), a dessert- 
spoonful of anchovy sauce, some pepper and cayenne, quarter 
pound of cheese broken into pieces. Stir it well until dissolved, 
then spread on toasted bread and serve. 

TOASTED CHEESE. — 1. 

Grate three ounces of fat cheese, mix it with the yolk of one 



RELISHES. 109 

egg, four ounces of grated bread and three ounces of butter, beat 
the whole well in a mortar, with a dessert -spoonful of mustard, 
and a little salt and pepper. Toast some slices of bread, lay the 
paste thick upon it, put it for a minute before the fire and send to 
table very hot. 

TOASTED CHEESE. — 2. 

Put into a clean sauce-pan a table-spoonful of either ale (not 
bitter) or cold water ; add some slices of toasting cheese, and let 
it simmer until it is melted, stirring it all the time. Have ready 
in a bowl some good ale, sweeten it to the taste with moist sugar 
and add some grated nutmeg, loast slices of bread without 
either burn or crust, put them hot into the bowl, to take the chill 
oflf the ale, then put a slice of the toast on a hot plate for each per- 
son, and pour upon it as much of the cooked cheese as may be 
agreeable. Take out of the bowl any remaining toast there may 
be left ; stir well the sugar from the bottom, and drink the ale af- 



ter eating the cheese. 



AXCHOVY CHEESE. 



Put a piece of cheese into a stewpan, and, when soft, mash it 
with butter or any other grease. Now add half a pint of water, 
hot or cold, a little salt, and an anchovy cut small. Boil the whole 
together, adding as much flour from time to time as the liquid will 
absorb. When you have got a thick paste, pour over it some eggs 
beaten up, and mix the whole well together. Lastly, pull your 
paste into small lumps, and bake in an oven. 

CHEESE OMELET. 

Butter the sides of a deep dish, cover the bottom with thin slices 
of cheese, place upon this very thin slices of bread, well buttered, 
a little red pepper and mustard, another layer of cheese, and, 
just before putting in the oven, beat the yolk of an egg in a cup of 
cream and pour into the dish. Bake half an hour or until nicely 
browned. 

CHEESE rONDU. 

A quarter of a pound of butter, one ounce and half of flour 



110 RELISHES. 

four eggs, three ounces cheese grated, not quite half a pint of milk. 
Place the butter and flour in a saucepan on the hot plate, stir to- 
gether : next add the grated cheese ; stir on for twenty minutes, 
when remove it, and let it get cold. Beat the eggs, yolks and 
whites separately, add the yolks to the mixture cold, but the whites 
must be beaten and added just before baking. Bake in a brisk 
oven on a silver fondu dish, or a round cake tin concealed with a 
frilled paper, about three quarters of an hour. Serve hot, as it 
will fall in cooling. 

FONDU STRAWS. 

Quarter of a pound of pufif paste and quarter of an ounce of 
good cheese grated very fine, a little salt and cayenne pepper 
mixed ; sprinkle the cheese, salt, and pepper over the paste, and 
roll it two or three times ; cut it into narrow strips about five inches 
long ; bake them in a slow oven and serve very hot. 

POTTED CHEESE. 

One pound of cheese beaten in a mortar; two ounces of liquid 
butter, one glass of sherry, and a very small quantity of cayenne 
pepper, mace, and salt. All should be well beaten together and 
put into a pretty shaped glass potting-jar, with a layer of butter a^ 
the top. It makes a delicious relish for bread or toast. 

POT CHEESE. 

Scald a pint of sour milk till it curdles, strain off the whey and 
form the curd into round cakes an inch thick, adding salt to taste. 
The milk should not be old ; if very sour, a little sweet milk scalded 
with it improves the flavor. 

MACARONI. ■ 

Put four or five ounces of macaroni in water, and boil for twen- 
ty minutes, until tender. Mix into half a pint of milk a little 
flour, and a small piece of butter, half a tea-cup of cream, half a 
tea-spoonful of mustard, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and four ounces 
of good fat cheese grated very fine ; stir all together and boil for 
ten minutes. Pour this over the macaroni, after draining it from 
the water; boil five or six minutes and serve. 



RELISHES. Ill 



TIMBALL OF MACARONI. 



Roll some puff paste very thin, and cut it into narrow bands, 
and twist each into a kind of cord, which coil around the insides 
of small butter moulds. Then fill each mould with macaroni, 
cover the top with equal quantities of grated br6ad and good fat 
cheese ; put them into a warm oven, and let them bake three quar- 
ters of an hour, turn them out on a dish and serve them. 



PICKLES. 



CUCUJIBERS. — 1. 

To pickle cucumbers for market cut them from the vines without 
bruising the stems, take them carefully to the cellar, pack In barrels 
putting different sizes in separate barrels ; spread a layer of salt 
between each layer of cucumbers, sufficient to entirely cover the 
pickles. Pack the cucumbers daily as they are picked, discarding 
the crooked or those of slow growth. The brine will be formed 
without the addition of water, by the juice extracted by the salt. 
Keep boards over the pickles, with weights to press them under 
the brine. Pickles packed in this way can be preserved for years 
with pure salt ; but If the salt Is rdixed with lime they will soften 
and spoil. In two months after the barrel Is filled, take them from 
the brine, freshen and green. To green them, prepare alum water, 
put the pickles in a vat or boiler lined with tinned copper ; heat 
the alum water, and pour It over them. Pickle makers usually 
employ this process except that they throw steXm Into the vats to 
heat the alum water, and if managed properly the pickles may be 
greened with less action of copper than when scalded in the usual 
method in bright brass kettles. Take the pickles from the vat when 
a little green, and pour over them water boiling hot. ' If not 
greened sufficiently, repeat the hot water until they are the desired 
color, and when cold put them In good vinegar. Let them remain 
until quite soured ; then change to pretty strong vinegar, which will 
keep the pickles hard and sour. Add six large peppers, without 
bruising, to each barrel, and keep the pickles under the vinegar 
with weights. 

CUCUMBERS. — 2. 

A simpler method Is, pick the cucumbers with a bit of the stem 



PICKLES. 113 

on, wipe them clean and put tliera into the following pickle, at the 
rate of one part vinegar, two parts water, and three salt, with a 
good sized root of horseradish. When the tub is full, put a cloth 
over the cucumbers and a clean flat stone over the cloth, cover the 
tub and set it in the cellar. In the spring soak them and pickle 
them in vinegar. 

TOMATOES. 

Wipe the tomatoes clean • slice them, if large, twice in two ; if 
small, only once. Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar on the bottom of 
a stone jar, then a layer of tomatoes, and then a sprinkling of 
sugar, and so on. When the jar is full, add vinegar and set it in 
a warm place. In a few weeks they will be good pickles. The 
tomatoes must be kept under the vinegar, and the jar tightly cov- 
ered. 

BEETS 

Boil the beets till tender, then drop them whole or sliced into 
spiced vinegar. 

GREEN TOMATOES. 

Let green tomatoes stand in salt and water for twelve hours. 
Then stick four or five cloves in each one, and pour boiling vinegar 
over them. Place them in a jar and set them in a cool place. 

MUSTARD PICKLE. 

Half peck of small cucumbers, half peck of green string beans, 
one quart of green peppers, two quarts of small onions. Cut all 
in small pieces ; put cucumbers and beans in a strong brine for 
twenty -four hours. Remove from brine and pour on two pounds 
of ground mustard mixed with one pint of sweet oil, and tbree 
quarts of vinegar. 

GREEN PICKLE. 

In two quarts of good vinegar, boil quarter of a pound of salt, two 
ounces of shallots, two large tea-spoonsful of cayenne pepper, one 
ounce of ginger, and one ounce of white pepper ; when well boiled, 
cool and pour it in a jar upon any freshly gathered green fruits and 
vegetables desired to be pickled. 



114 PICKLES, 



ONIONS. — 1. 

Peel small onions and lay them for one day in salt and water, 
changing their position once during the time. Boil together good 
vinegar, cloves, mace, and a little pepper, dry the onions, pour the 
pickle over them in a jar, and cover them closely. 

ONIONS — 2. 

To prevent watery eyes while peeling, put them in a pot of boil- 
ing water. Let them stand a few moments to drain, then peel them, 
put them into milk and water, with a little salt ; when it boils, 
strain off the onions, wipe dry, and put them in wide-mouthed bot- 
tles. Have very old white wine vinegar, in which whole white 
pepper, ginger, mace, and horseradish have been boiled. Pour it 
over the onions, and cover down close with bladders. 

PORTUGAL ONIONS. 

The Portugal onion makes an excellent pickle prepared in the 
following way : one large onion and one large baking apple, cut 
up into small pieces, mixed well together, and put into a pickle 
jar, into which enough boiling vinegar must be poured to cover 
the mixture and fill up the jar. 

FRENCH BEANS. 

Make a strong brine of salt and water, gather the beans before 
they have strings, lay them in the brine till yellow, drain them dry 
and put boiling hot vinegar over them. Close them tightly for a 
day and night. Boil the vinegar and pour it on again for several 
days till they turn green. To one peck of beans put half an 
ounce each of pepper, mace and cloves. 

CABBAGE. 

Cut a firm cabbage into thin slices, spread It on an open dish, 
sprinkle it over with salt for two or three days, then strain it 
through a sieve or colander, so as to take all water from it ; place 
it in your jar, and pour as much boiling vinegar as will cover it ; 
lay over the jar a cloth to keep In all the steam until quite cold, 
then tie it down air tight. It will keep for a very long time. A 
few slices of beet root gives a good color. 



PICKLES. 115 



CABBAGE WITH SWEET PICKLE. 

Cut the beads into quarters, let them stand in cold water a short 
time. Chop them fine, together -with nice fine celery sufficient to 
season it. Fill small jars or cans, make a sweet pickle of molasses 
and vinegar, season with plenty of red pepper and cinnamon, and 
other spices to the taste ; boil altogether a few moments and pour 
over the cabbage while hot. Cork the cans and place in the cellar. 
This should not be eaten under three or four weeks. It is a nice 
relish with cold meats, etc. 

RED CABBAGE. 

Put a quarter of an ounce of cochineal into a small bag, and boil 
it with the quantity of vinegar considered sufficient for the cabbage 
you wish to pickle, adding a little salt, and bay salt. When it 
boils, scald the cabbage with it, having previously cut it into slices ; 
boil the vinegar up again, this time adding ginger and pepper. 
Let it cool, and when quite cold, having put the cabbage into jars, 
pour the pickle upon it, and tie it down closely. The cochineal 
preserves the color ; beet root may be used instead. Both are 
quite harmless. 

MELONS, MANGOES AND CUCUMBERS. 

Melons should not be much more than half grown, but cucum- 
bers full grown. Cut off the top, but leave it hanging by a bit of 
rind, which is to serve as a hinge to a box lid ; scoop out all the 
seeds with a spoon, and fill the fruit with equal parts of mustard 
seed, ground pepper and ginger, or flour of mustard instead of the 
seed, and two or three cloves of garlic. The lid which incloses 
the spice may be sewed down or tied, by running a white thread 
through the ends. The pickle may be prepared with the spices, or, 
if preferred, with the following ingredients: To each quart of 
vinegar put salt, flour of mustard, curry powder, bruised ginger, 
tumeric, half ounce of each ; of cayenne pepper, one drachm ; 
rub all these together with a large glassful of salad oil ; eschalots, 
two ounces, garlic, half ounce, sliced. Steep the spice in the vin- 
egar as before directed, and put the vegetables into it hot. 



116 PICKLES. 



GHERKINS. 

A quick mode of pickling gherkins, or prickly cucumbers, is to 
prick them with a needle in several places, and put them in a pan 
of cold water, adding as much salt as will make a strong brine. 
Let them soak for three hours . Take them out, wipe them dry in a 
clean cloth ; put in a saucepan, over a gentle fire, add some strong, 
brown pickling vinegar, with allspice, half the quantity of whole 
black pepper, a little brown ginger and some cayenne pepper. 
Let them simmer quarter of an hour ; take them up, and when cold, 
pour them over the gherkins in a jar, and stop them tightly down. 
They will be fit for use in the course of three or four days. One 
or two eschalots will be found an improvement. 

PICCILILLI. 

Use all kinds of vegetables that may be pickled. Slice cabbages, 
and pull cauhflowers in bunches, put them on earthen dishes, 
sprinkled over with salt, and let them stand three days to dry. 
Sliced cucumbers, green tomatoes, gherkins, radish pods, onions, 
beans, nasturtiums and anything you like that may be pickled, 
put it into salt and water one day. The next day dry them ; take 
a few at a time and scald in brown vinegar, and when all are 
scalded, set the vinegar away. To four quarts of brown vinegar, 
put a quarter of a pound of ginger, two ounces of allspice, quart- 
er of a pound of shallots, two ounces of tumeric, and boil slowly 
half an hour. Take some boiling vinegar, and mix eight ounces 
of flour of mustard and pour it into the vinegar and spices ; it 
must not boil after the mustard is put in. Put the prepared veg- 
etables and spices in a large jar, scatter some brown mustard 
seed among the mixture, and stir it up well in the jar. If at any 
time it should become too dry, add cold boiled vinegar ; for the 
vegetable must be kept covered with vinegar mixture. Cover the 
jar air tight and set in a cool place. 

LEMON PICKLE. 

The fruit should be small with thick rinds. Rub them with a 
piece of flannel ; then slit them down in quarters, but not quite 
through the pulp, fill the slits with salt hard pressed in ; set them 



PICKLES. 117 

upright in a pan for four or five days until the salt melts ; turn 
them three days until they become tender in their liquor. Then 
make enough pickle to cover them, of ripe vinegar, the brine of the 
lemons, Jamaica pepper and ginger ; boil and skim it. When 
cold, put it over the lemons. 

TO PICKLE ROOTS. 

Roots, such as carrots, salsify, and beet roots, may be pickled by 
being sliced, or cut into small pieces, and slightly boiled in vine- 
gar without destroying their crispness, and adding the common 
spices ; with beet roots put button onions, or cut some Spanish on- 
ions in slices, lay them alternately in a jar ; boil one quart of vin- 
egar, with one ounce of mixed pepper, half an ounce of ginger, 
some salt, and pour it cold over the beet root and onions. 

BARBERRIES. — 1. 

Gather when not over ripe, pick off the leaves and dead stalks. 
Place them in jars, pour over them cold boiled salt and water, and 
close them tightly. They must be looked at occasionally, and as 
soon as a scum is seen to rise on them, they should be put into 
fresh salt and water. 

BARBERRIES. 2. 

Another method is to place them in a wide-mouthed bottle and 
pour over them cold distilled vinegar that has been previous- 
ly boiled with a little spice, and keep them well corked. They are 
delicious when eaten with fish, and look very pretty round the 
dish. 

BARBERRIES, (Sweet.) — 1. 

Add half a pound of sugar and a pint of molasses to each 
pound of the berries, simmer them together half an hour or more, 
until they become soft. 

BARBERRIES, (Swed.) — 2 

With every half pound of moist sugar mix one pint of water, 
and one pint of white wine vinegar : put the worst of the barber- 
ries in this and boil till the liquor is a bright deep color. Put the 



118 PICKLES. 

rest of the berries in glasses, let the liquor stand till cold, then 
strain it, wringing the cloth to get all the color from the barberries. 
Let it settle, then pour it into the glasses. Cover tightly with a 
bladder and leather. 

WALNUTS. 

Put them into strong salt, and water, for nine days ; stir them 
frequently, and change the salt and water, every three days. Let 
them stand in a hair sieve till they turn black. Put them into 
strong stone jars, and pour boiling vinegar over them. Cover 
them, and let them stand till they are cold. Scald the vinegar 
three times more, pour it each time upon the walnuts, and let them 
stand till cold between each boiling ; cover them closely, and let 
them stand two months. Make- for them a pickle of two quarts of 
vinegar, half an ounce of olives, the same of mace, one ounce of 
ginger, the same of long-pepper, and two ounces of salt. Boil it 
ten minutes, pour it hot on the walnuts, and cover them tight. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Fill a stone pot with asparagus, make a pickle of water and 
have it salt enough to bear an egg ; pour it on hot and keep it 
covered tight. Before using, put the asparagus in cold water for 
two hours. Then boil and butter and send to table. If they are 
used for pickles take them out of the brine, boil them and cover 
them with vinegar. 

BLACKBERRIES. " •- 

To six wooden quarts of blackberries add three pounds of sugar 
and one quart of good vinegar. Let them stand covered until a 
syrup is formed, then pour it off, boil, and skim it off clear; put 
in the fruit and let it just come to a boil. Take it out carefully. 
Let the syrup boil up once more, then pour over and seal or tie 
down. 

MUSHROOMS. ' 

Button mushrooms, to preserve their flavor, should be rubbed 
with a piece of flannel dipped in salt. To preserve their color, 
keep them in spring water both before and after rubbing. From 



PICKLES. 119 

the larger mushrooms remove the red inside ; when this is turned 
black they are too old. Throw a little salt over them and put 
them into a stewpan with some mace and red pepper ; as the li- 
quor comes out, shake them well and simmer them over a gentle 
fire till all of it is dried into them again. Put as much vinegar 
into the pan as will cover theJi ; make . t warm, and then pour all 
into glass jars or bottles, and tie down tightly, with a bladder. 
They will keep two years. 



SALADS. 



SPRING SALADS. 

Use salads on the table as early as possible in the Spring ; they 
are pleasant and very healthful. Water-cresses should be a stand- 
ing dish upon the breakfast table ; and lettuce, with chives, pepper- 
grass, and whatever else is available, at dinner. Never mind the 
regular salad mixture of sweet oil and the like, if it is not conven- 
ient or agreeable. Pepper, salt and vinegar, are very good condi- 
ments alone, and we must even confess a weakness for an old- 
fashioned sprinkling of white sugar and vinegar on our lettuce, 
occasionally ; but eat it at any rate, if only with salt. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

Mince all the tender meat, white and dark, of a pair of chick- 
ens, fine. They should have been previously boiled or roasted. 
Chop all the white part of a large head of celery, with one or two 
young heads of lettuce, if they can be had, and mix with the chick- 
en. Make a dressing of the yolks of eggs, boiled twenty minutes, 
and rubbed smooth witli a spoon, two tea-spoonsful of made Eng- 
lish mustard, a tea-spoonful of salt, two table-spoonsful of salad 
oil, a dessert-spoonful of white sugar, and half a pint of strong 
vinegar. Pour the dressing over the chicken and celery, in a salad 
bowl, and garnish with rings cut from the boiled whites of the 
eggs. 

CARROT SALAD. 

Boil your carrots tender, chop them fine, with the whites of 
hard boiled eggs. Pour over them a sauce made of the yolks of 
the eggs beaten smooth, with a small piece of butter, a little pep- 



SALADS. 121 

per and salt, a table-spoonful of vinegar, and a tea-spoonful of 
made mustard. 

FISH SALAD. 

Cold fish may be made into a very excellent salad in this way : 
Cut it as neatly as possible into pieces about one or two inches 
square ; put them into a deep dish, add a little salt, and a small 
quantity of very finely chopped onions ; squeeze the juice of a 
lemon over it ; cover the dish with a plate, and set it away for two 
hours. Then take fresh lettuce, well drained from the water, cut 
it into pieces and pile it up high in the centre of a dish ; drain the 
fish from the lemon juice, and place in a circle round the pile of 
lettuce as you would cutlets ; pour some salad sauce over the let- 
tuce, only keeping the fish white. Place parsley leaves between 
the pieces of fish, or a small piece of red beet-root, to garnish. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Mince the meat from the body and claws fine, mash the coral, 
and mix it with scalded lettuce chopped fine. Make a sauce of a 
little pepper, a very little cayenne, a tea-spoonful of French mus- 
tard, four table-spoonsful of salad oil, and four table-spoonsful of 
strong vinegar. Mash the yolks of three boiled eggs, mix them 
with the coral and the sauce, and add it before serving. [For 
another receipt, see Lobsters.] 

AN EAST LNDIAN SALAD. 

Take a large boiled crab, pick the meat clean from the shell, and 
chop it up finely. Place it in a deep salad dish, adding one gill of 
tarragon, and one tea-spoonful of Chili vinegar, one table-spoonful 
of pure Lucca or Florence oil, with an anchovy bruised in a mor- 
tar. Let these be well mixed together. Chop one blanched 
endive, one stick of celery, and a small bunch of green chives, 
with salt to taste, and arrange the ingredients with a spoon in 
your salid dish. This is a good relish eaten with toasted cheese, 
or cold fowl, and other choice meats. 

SALAD FOR COLD LAMB. 

Wash and chop finely three large lettuces. Have ready a bunch 
6 



122 SALADS. 

of harhe de capuchin a buncli of water cresses, half a dozen young 
radishes, a little punnet and cress, two or there sprigs of tarragon 
leaves, a handful of corn-salad, twelve young chives, and a boiled 
beet root. Pour into a salad bowl two table-spoonsful of Lucca or 
Florence oil, a tea-spoonful of sweet anchovy sauce, ateaspoonful of 
Chili vinegar, the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs beaten up with 
cream, with salt to taste. Mix all together, adding a gill of vine- 
gar. Cut up the roots and esculents, and stir them in till the 
salad is evenly mixed. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

Take ripe tomatoes and cut them in thin slices ; sprinkle over 
them a small quantity of finely chopped green onions, add salt, 
pepper, vinegar, and oil if liked. The oil should be in the propor- 
tion of three table-spoonsful to one of vinegar. Serve with any 
roast meats. 

POTATO SAI.AD. 

When materials for a salad are scarce, this is a good way of dis- 
posing of cold potatoes. Slice them, and dress them with oil, vine- 
gar, salt, and pepper, precisely like any other salad ; adding a little 
chives, or an onion, and parsley chopped fine. If oil is not agree- 
able, use cream or a little melted butter. 

THE P0ET"'S salad. 

Pass two well boiled potatoes through a sieve, add a tea-spoon- 
ful of mustard, two tea-spoonsful of salt, one of essence of ancho- 
vy, quarter of a tea-spoonful of very finely chopped onions, well- 
bruised into the mixture, three table-spoonsful of oil, one of vine- 
gar, the pounded yolks of two hard boiled eggs. Stir it up tlior- 
oughly before serving. 

LETTUCE SALAD. 

Chop lettuces small and mix in a little of young onions if liked, 
make a sauce for them in the proportion of a table- spoonful of 
sugar to two of vinegar, and a little black pepper. 

HOTCH POTCH. 

Green tomatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers, one pint of each, 



SALADS. 123 

half-a-pint of onions ; chop all very fine, salt well, let them stand 
one night, after which strain through a sieve, and add pepper, 
horseradish, white mustard seed, and half pint of sugar ; mix 
well, lightly, fill your jar, and cover with good vinegar. 

CHOW CHOW. 

One peck of green tomatoes, six onions, four green peppers ; 
chop fine, mix salt with them, let them stand one night, then 
squeeze through a cloth all moisture ; after which add one table- 
spoonful of allspice, one of cloves, orm of black . pepper, four 
table-spoonsful of horseradish, one half pound of white mustard 
seed, mix it well, pack it in your jar, and cover with good vine- 
gar. 

CABBAGE AND VINEGAR. 

Take half a cup of vinegar and a tea-spoonful of butter heated 
well. Beat an egg and stir into it, but after it is cool enough, so 
as not to cook the egg. Then cut up your cabbage, add salt and 
pepper 5 pour the mixture warm over it and set aside for dinner. 

COLE SLAW. 

Take the small head of a cabbage after removing six or seven 
outside leaves and cutting off the stalk as close as possible, chop 
fine, and mix with plenty of vinegar, salting it to taste. 

AN EXCELLENT CHOW CHOW PICKLE. 

Take one large head of slaw cabbage, two large bunches of 
celery, and twelve onions ; slice all fine and salt well. After 
twenty-four hours, drain well and cover with vinegar, to remain 
twelve hours ; then drain from the vinegar ; add four red peppers 
and two green ones, finely cut up ; one ounce of tumeric, quarter 
of a pound of mustard-seed, two table-spoonsful of mixed mus- 
tard, one spoonful of allspice, half the quantity of cloves, one 
table -spoonful of black pepper, half a cup of sweet oil, one cup of 
brown sugar ; mix all together and cover with vinegar. More cele- 
ry may be used if desired. 

TOMATO SOY. 

To a peck of green tomatoes put a tea-cup of fine salt and a

dozen green peppers. Chop tomatoes and peppers fine, work the 
salt well through the whole. Let stand twenty-four hours ; then 
drain the brine oflf, spice to taste with cinnamon and cloves, pack 
down in a jar, and just cover with vinegar, in which the spice has 
been boiled, while it is hot. 

HANDY CHOW CHOW. 

Chop together very finely a head of cabbage, six green peppers, 
six green tomatoes, add two tea-spoonsful of mustard, sufficient 
salt, vinegar to wet it, and if desired a little cloves and allspice. 
It is ready then for use, and will keep a long time. No better 
appetizer can be made. 



EGGS. 



BOILED. 

Put the required number of eggs into a saucepan containing boil- 
ing water sufficient to cover them, and put it in a place on the range 
where it will keep boiling hot, but not boil. Let them stand seven 
minutes. When taken up, they will be found thickly and delicious- 
ly jellied throughout, and perfectly digestible. It is a much better 
and more certain way, than boiling them. • 

Another method is to let them boil gently for thirty minutes. 
This is an excellent plan for persons who like hard boiled eggs, or 
for invalids, as eggs cooked for this length of time can be easily 
digested, by the most delicate stomach. 

SCRAMBLED. 

Beat up a dozen eggs and turn them into a pan in which a little 
butter has been allowed to melt ; throw in finely chopped boiled 
ham or parsley, and a little pepper and salt, and toss about rapid- 
ly, to prevent sticking. Serve upon buttered toast. 

POACHED. 

Carefully break fresh eggs into a shallow pan of boiling water ; 
have ready slices of buttered toast, and when the white part has 
set round the yolks, take them up with a skimmer and lay each one 
upon a slice of bread. They are seasoned at table. 

BUTTERED EGGS. 

Warm a piece of butter in a saucepan, add pepper and salt, or 
other seasoning. Break in the eggs, stirring them very quickly 
with a fork over the fire, and take them oflf instantly they begin to 
set. Continue the stirring for a minute, and servo on buttered 
toast. 



126 EGGS. 

FRIED {with ham.) 

Break eggs one by one, into a saucer, and slip them into a pan 
in which ham has been lightly and quickly browned, (not dried up,) 
and fry them a light brown on the underside ; by this time they 
will have assumed consistency on the top, and must be taken up 
carefully with a fish-slice or skimmer, without turning, and placed 
round the edge of the dish, the ha,m occupying the centre. 

OMELET. 

The proper way to make an omelet is to take three tea-spoons- 
ful of milk for each egg, and a pinch of salt to each one also ; beat 
the eggs lightly for three or four minutes, and pour them into a 
hot pan in which a piece of butter the size of a walnut has been 
melted a moment before ; the mass will begin to bubble and rise 
immediately, and the bottom must be lifted incessantly with a clean 
knife so that the softer parts run in. An omelet should be cooked 
three or fbur minutes, and, made in this way, will melt in the 
mouth. If desired, beat with the eggs finely chopped ham or 
parsley. In sliding the omelet from the pan to the dish, fold it 
double. 

PUFF OMELET. 

Beat the yolks of six eggs light, mix with a small tea-cup of 
milk, and little salt. Beat together of sweet butter and flour each 
a table-spoonful until smooth ; add the mixture to the custard, and 
beat the whole well together. Pour into a buttered pan, and when 
it appears to thicken add the whites, well beaten ; dust over a trifle 
of salt, and when the whole is stiff, remove carefully to the dish. 

OMELET WITH KIDNEYS. 

Take a calf's kidney roasted, chop it finely and beat it with the 
eggs ; cook them as directed for plain omelet. 

OMELET WITH HERBS. 

Beat half a dozen eggs as for plain omelet, chop fine parsley 
and cives, take two table-spoonsful of parsley ; and one of cives 
beat with the eggs, and put all in a pan in which three or four 



EGGS. 127 

ounces of butter are melted ; fry, dropping a piece of butter the 
size of a nutmeg under it when half done, so that it will not adhere 
to the pan, and serve hot. 

ASPARAGUS AND EGGS. 

Boil the good part of the asparagus in water and a little salt, 
drain it and chop it fine, beat it with the eggs as for omelet ; put 
it in a pan with hot butter in it, fry and serve hot. Sorrel may be 
cooked with eggs in the same manner. 

.EGGS AND APPLES. 

Beat up the eggs as for omelet, pare and slice the apples, fry 
them in a little butter, take them out, and stir them in with the 
eggs. Melt a little butter in the pan, put in the eggs and apples ; 
fry, turning over once and serve it hot. 

EGGS AND MUSHROOMS. 

Dress and chop the mushrooms, beat them with the eggs as for 
omelets, melt a little butter in the pan, and put them in ; fry them, 
and serve hot. 

FANCY OMELET. 

Make four omelets of three or four eggs each, one plain, one 
with herbs, one with apples, one with asparagus or sorrel. Serve 
on the same dish, one lapping over the other. 

EGGS AND HERRINGS. 

Beat up three or four eggs, according to the quantity required, 
with pepper, a little parsley, a green onion cut very fine. Also 
open a red herring at the back, broil it and mince it fine. Add all 
together, and fry in a frying-pan with a little grease. No salt is 
required, as the herring is salt enough. 

EGGS AND CHEESE. 

Into a pie dish put four or five spoonsful of cream, or milk 
thickened with flour ; break into it some six or eight eggs without 
breaking the yolks ; sprinkle over the whole some grated cheese , 
and a little pepper. Bake in an oven, without allowing the yolks 
to harden. 



128 EGGS. 



PICKLED EGGS. 

Take as many eggs as you wish to pickle, cover them with cold 
water, let them come to a boil, and holl Jive minutes. Take 
off and put into cold water ; remove the shells carefully, and put 
the eggs in a jar. Take as much strong vinegar as will cover 
them, with cloves, allspice, black pepper, and a little red pepper ; 
when it comes to a boil, pour it upon the eggs, with a little salt. 
Cover down when cold. They will be ready for use in three days, 
but are best when about a week old. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS.— 1. 

Make a pickle of quick lime and salt strong enough to bear up 
an egg. Put in your eggs point downward, and they will keep 
perfectly for a year. Another method is to rub the outside of each 
egg with a piece of fried fat, and then put them in a jar, small end 
downward, in which has been placed a layer of coarse salt. Al- 
ternate a layer of salt with a layer of eggs until the jar is filled, 
rubbing each egg with grease, and placing always the small end 
down. Cover down tight and keep in a cool, dry place, and they 
will keep from June to June again. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS. — 2. 

Store them away before they are twenty-four hours old. Pack 
them in a cask with plenty of bran, taking care that they do not 
touch each other. Another method is to place them in a box, small 
end downwards, in salt which entirely covers them. 



VEGETABLES. 



BOILED POTATOES. 

New potatoes are scraped instead of peeled. In peeling, the 
thinner the portion taken off, the better. The nutriment of a po- 
tato is contained within half an inch of its surface, and careless 
hacking with a large knife will waste half of it. Late in the sea- 
son, when potatoes are old, they may be pared and put to soak in 
cold water four or five hours before cooking. In boiling put a 
small handful of salt in the water, and let it boil before putting in 
the potatoes. Pour the water off, and let them stand uncovered 
near the fire to dry. To steam them, the pot may be returned to 
the fire covered with a coarse cloth. The water should be poured 
off the moment they show a tendency to crack, or a fork will pass 
easily through them. The potatoes for each mess should be of as 
equal size as possible. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

After being boiled break them to a paste and season with a lit- 
tle butter, salt and cream or milk. If any are left over press them 
down in a dish, and the next morning cut in slices and fry brown, 
with butter and pepper and a little chopped parsley. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel half a dozen medium potatoes, cut them up small, and put 
them into cold water for about half an hour ; take them out, dry 
with a towel, and put them in a frying-pan, with two ounces of 
butter and a little salt; cover down, and every little while, shake 
and turn them ; when they are tender, and of a clear, light, rich 
brown, they are done ; the grease should be drained off from them, 
and they are ready to send to table.

POTATO SHAVINGS. 



Wash and peel three or four large potatoes, then continue cut- 
ting them into thin wide ribbons, as evenly as possible. Have 
ready boiling fat, drop them into it ; when they are done a light 
brown drain them well over the stove and send them to table im- 
mediately, before they lose their erispness. 

STEWED POTATOES. 

Pare the potatoes, cut them in slices, throw them into hot water 
to rinse, then put them in the sauce pan with boiling water enough 
for gravy. When nearly done season with pepper, salt, and a 
little butter ; and thicken with flour batter. Let it boil up two or 
three times, and send to the table. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

The most wholesome method of preparing potatoes is to bake 
them in hot ashes, and eat them with butter. To bake them in a 
stove, wash and rinse them, place them on a tin, and let them re- 
main in the oven about two hours. Send them to the table with 
the skins on, or mash them with a little salt and gravy or cream. 
They are very good served with cold meat. 

POTATO PIE. 

Make a thin pie-crust in the usual way, and line with it a basin 
or deep pie-dish. Fill to the top with finely-shred potatoes, among 
which mix an onion or two, sliced very thin, pepper and salt, and 
a little butter, dripping, or lard. Pour over all as much good milk 
or cream as the dish or basin will hold. Either cover with a crust 
or not, according to option, and bake in a slow oven. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Take two pounds of very mealy boiled potatoes, mash them 
very fine with a little salt, mix them with two pounds of flour, add 
milk enough to beat this into dough, beating it up with a spoon, 
and put in a little yeast. Set it before the fire to rise, and when 
it has risen, divide it into cakes the size of a muffin, and bake them. 
These may be cut open and buttered hot. 



VEGETABLES. 131 



POTATO PUDDING. 



Mash up well all your cold potatoes -with a fork, moisten with 
milk, add two table-spoonsful of flour, two table-spoonsful of 
minced onions, and one ounce of grease to every pound of mashed 
potatoes. Put into a basin, bake till brown, which will be about 
half an hour, and serve hot. 

POTATOES A LA CREME. 

Put into a saucepan about two ounces of butter, a dessert spoonful 
of flour, some parsley and scalllons, both chopped small, salt and 
pepper; stir these up together, add a wine glass of cream, and set 
it on the fire, stirring continually until it bolls. Cut some boiled 
potatoes into slices, and put them into the saucepan with the mix- 
ture, boil all together, and serve them very hot. 

SCOLLOPED POTATOES. 

Beat boiled potatoes fine with cream, a large piece of butter and 
some salt. Put it in scollop shells, smooth them on the top, 
score with a knife, lay thin slices of butter on them and brown 
them quickly before the fire, or in the oven. 

TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. 

Dress them, and throw them into plenty of boiling water which 
has been salted and well skimmed ; boil them fast until well done, 
keeping them uncovered, but being careful that they are not smok- 
ed. If the water is hard, a third of a tea-spoonful of carbonate 
of soda may be added with the salt to improve the color, but too 
much will injure them, and if green peas are being boiled, will re- 
duce them to a mush. 

GREEN CORN. 

Take two dozen ears of green corn well cleaned from the silk, 
slightly cut off the edge of the kernels with a sharp knife, and 
scrape the remainder off. Place in a pot with two tea-cupsful of 
water. When cooked out so there is danger of burning, thin with 
sweet milk ; when done, season with salt and pepper ; add butter 
to vour taste. 



132 VEGETABLES. 



GREEN CORN ON THE EAR. 

Select a dozen more or less, of nice, young ears, free them from 
every particle of silk, and throw them into boiling water with a 
table-spoonful of salt. If very young, fifteen minutes will cook 
thera. As the corn grows older, it will require more time. Serve 
hot, with butter, pepper and salt. 

CORN OYSTERS. 

Take six ears of boiled corn, three eggs, one and a half table- 
spoonsful of flour. Beat the yolks very thick ; cut the com off the 
cob, season it with pepper and salt ; mix it with the yolks, and add 
the flour. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, stir them in with the 
com and yolks ; put a dessert-spoonful at a time in a pan of hot 
butter, and fry to a light brown on both sides. 

SPRING GREENS. 

Young beet and turnips tops make nice greens in the early 
spring. Pick, and wash them carefully from dust and insects, and 
boil with them a small piece of salt pork, bacon, ham or corned 
beef. Drain free from water, and serve with vinegar. They may 
be boiled plain, and served with gravy sauce. 

SUCCOTASH. 

Strip off the kernels from a dozen ears of nice sweet corn, very 
close to the ear, with a sharp, thin knife. Put them in a saucepan 
with a quart of Lima beans, a little veal stock or gravy or plain 
water, and let them simmer steadily, till the moisture is absorbed, 
and the corn and beans tender. Add then, a cup of milk, a small 
piece of butter, pepper and salt to taste, and let all simmer to- 
gether until thoroughly amalgamated. Serve in covered dish. 
Succotash is very good made with string beans, cut small, and 
boiled with a slice of sweet salt pork ; it then requires neither milk 
nor butter. 

SQUASH FRITTERS. 

One pint of cooked squash, one pint of milk, two eggs and a 
little salt, and sufficient flour to make them turn easily on the grid- 
dle. 



VEGETABLES. 133 



BOILED SQUASH. 

Peel a nice spring squash, take out the seeds and coarse part 
from the centre, cut it up in slices, and put it to stew with a little 
water, in a small covered saucepan. When it is quite tender, 
mash it, put to it a spoonful of cream or a little butter, pepper 
and salt to taste, and keep hot, till wanted for the table. 

SEA KALE. 

This should be boiled quite white, in milk, and may be served 
on toast hke asparagus. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. 

Cut them in quarters, peel and remove the seeds, boil until ten- 
der, and serve with toasted bread and sweet cream. 

SALSIFY OR VEGETABLE OYSTER. 

The roots look like horseradish ; they must be well scraped, cut 
in two, and parboiled. The water is then drained off, the plant 
cut up fine and boiled up in milk, with a little butter, pepper and 
salt. Some persons think it acquires more the taste of the oyster, 
by having a little cod-fish stirred among it, but we prefer it with- 
out. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 

They should be boiled, putting them at first into cold water, and 
must be taken up the moment they are done, or they will be too 
soft. They may be boiled plain, or served with white fricassee 
sauce. When boiled, if rubbed through a sieve with some fresh 
butter and cream, they form a splendid purre as a sauce for cutlets, 
or as a thickening for some sorts of white soup, or they may be 
sliced and fried. 

ARTICHOKE FRACIS. 

Having parboiled the artichokes, remove the middle leaves, pare 
it, stuff the centre with forcemeat and bake them until the meat is 
done. Serve with melted butter. 



134 VEGETABLES 



MASHED TURNIPS. 

Pare the turnips, cut them in half and boil in a pot with either 
beef, mutton, or lamb. When thej become tender, press the li- 
quor from them and mash them with pepper and salt. They may- 
be served in this way, or they may be sent to the table whole, 
with white sauce. 

EGG PLANT. 

This is a delicious vegetable. Select a medium sized one. Peel, 
and cut it in round, thin slices. Sprinkle a little salt between 
each slice, and then cover them down with a bowl, and let them 
stand for an hour. Then rinse off the salt with clear, cold water ; 
throw away the liquid at the bottom of the dish, which will be dark 
colored ; wipe each slice dry, dip it in egg, and bread crumbs, and 
fry it in half lard, and half butter, a fine brown. 



Pick apart and wash carefully in three or four waters ; put into 
the saucepan with a little salt. Press it down with a spoon and let 
it boil quickly about fifteen minutes. When tender turn it into a 
colander, and press out the water. Place it in the dish, raising 
it with a fork so that it may lie hollow ; serve with melted butter or 
e<rg sauce, and garnish with hard boiled eggs cut in rings. It re- 
quires no water in boiling, the expressed juice being quite suffi- 
cient to keep it moist, and the spinach being much finer without, 
than with it. 

DANDELIONS. 

These are relished by many as well as spinach cooked in the 
s.' me way. Take the young leaves before the plant blossoms or 
while in the bud, mash quite clean, boil tender in salted water, 
dram well and press them dry. They can be served plain with 
melted butter, or can be chopped and heated afresh with pepper, 
salt, and a little butter rolled in flour, and a spoonful or two of 
gravy or cream. A large quantity should be boiled, as they shrink 
very much. The dandelion is considered very healthy, and the 
slight bitterness is relished by most persons.

FRENCH BEANS. — 1. 

Well drain the beans ; after scalding them, color some butter in 
a saucepan, toss up the beans in it over the fire, season them with 
salt and pepper, and when dishing up add a very little vinegar. 

FRENCH BEANS. — 2. 

String the beans, cut them in two and then across, sprinkle them 
with salt, put them in boiling water and boil them up quickly. 

YOUNG BEETS BOILED. 

Beets are sweeter, and better when young, than when they 
have attained full size. Wash, and boil them, take off the skins 
after they are boiled, and put over them pepper, salt, and a little 
butter. When they have grown older, they require vinegar, and 
are indeed only fit for a pickle. Be careful never to prick beets 
in putting them in the pot, or while they are cooking, as that 
spoils the color, and injures the flavor. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Cut off the white ends, removing most of that which is hard ; 
scrape the hard ends a little. Put them in cold water for a short 
time, then tie them up in small bundles. When the water boils, 
put them in with a little salt ; boil until tender, about fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Toast a slice of bread brown on both sides. 
Take them up carefully, dip the toast in the asparagus water, and 
lay the heads on it with the Avhite ends outwards. Pour melted 
butter over them, and if desired garnish with quarters of an 
orange. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Pour boiling water over ripe tomatoes to crack the skin, so that 
it can be removed ; then cut them into small pieces, squeeze out 
some of the seeds without losing too much of the juice, then stew 
them without water, seasoning them with butter and salt. An 
onion, chopped fine may be stewed with them. Pepper may be 
added while stewing, or added at the table to each person's taste. 



136 VEGETABLES. 



GREEN PEAS. 

These should be fresh and newly shelled. Wash them and put 
them into enough boiling water to cover them, with a few leaves 
of mint, and a small piece of butter. Stir them occasionally and 
when tender drain the water from them, sprinkle on a little salt 
and serve them with melted butter. 

ONIONS, BOILED. 

Put them, after being peeled, in boiling water. Then when they 
are tender pour the water off, add butter, pepper, salt and a little 
milk, stew them up again and send them to the table hot. 

FRICASSEED PARSNIPS. 

Boil them in water until they are tender, then cut them into 
pieces two or three inches long, slice them and stew them in half a 
cupful of cream or milk, half a cupful of broth, a piece of floured 
butter, and pepper and salt. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Boil them tender ; when they are cool, slice them lengthwise, 
and fry them with some thin slices of boiled salt pork. Put in the 
parsnips when the fat is hot, pepper them, brown them on both 
sides ; crisp the pork, and serve with them. 

BOILED PARSNIPS. 

Wash, scrape, cut out ever}' speck or discoloration, and if large 
divide them. Put them in boiling water, skim it occasionally and 
let them boil from twenty to thirty minutes. Serve them mashed 
or plain, with melted butter. 

PORTUGAL ONIONS STEWED. 

Boil in water until they begin to soften, let them drain, put in a 
stewpan, cover with good thick brown gravy; let them remain 
until they are perfectly tender, and send them to table. 

PORTUGAL ONIONS FRIED. 

Peel and cut them in slices ; fry in butter or lard, or fat from 



VEGETABLES. 137 

cooking meat ; stir constantly while frying, and let them be of a 
dark brown color. 

LIMA BEANS. 

Shell the beans, put them in a considerable water, boiling with 
pickled parsley and sufficient salt ; boil them quickly, and when 
done strain off the water ; take them out, and season them with 
butter, pepper, and salt ; garnish with boiled parsley. 

BEST PORK AND BEANS. 

Pick over a quart of small white beans, put them to soak over 
night. Set them to boil the next morning, throwing off the water, 
just before they reach boiling point. Cover with cold water 
again, put in a square pound of nice sweet salt pork and let both 
boil together till the beans are tender. When the beans are done, 
the water should have all become absorbed ; they are then put In 
one pan to brown, and the pork in another, scoring the latter 
first, through the skin. Before serving set the pork in the centre 
of the beans. Serve with pickles and horseradish. 

BOILED CARROTS. 

To boil carrots in their own juice, wash clean and scrape them, 
cutting out discolored spots ; cut them in rather thick slices and 
throw them into as much boiling salted water as will cover or barely 
float them, and no more. Boil gently till they are tolerably ten- 
der, then boil very quickly to evaporate the water, of which only a 
spoonful or so should be left In the saucepan. Sprinkle on them a 
little pepper, put in a small piece of butter rolled In flour, turn and 
toss them gently till their juice is thickened by them, and adheres 
to them ; serve immediately. They are improved by adding a des- 
sert spoonful of minced parsley, with the butter and a little thick 
cream mixed with a very little flour to prevent its curdling. Gra- 
vy may be used instead of cream. 

CARROTS WITH P'ARSLEY. 

Take boiled carrots, and divide them down the length once, if 
very large divide again ; then cut them in slices the thickness of a 
silver quarter of a dollar. Take some, sprigs of parsley, parboil

and chop them small ; then put the sliced carrots Into a stewpan 
with the chopped parsley, a little bit of butter, some pepper, and 
salt, and a little cold gravy ; toss them over the fire till hot, and 



BOILED CABBAGE. 

Take off the outer leaves, cut the head in halves or quarters, and 
boil quickly in a large quantity of water, until done. Drain and 
press out the water, chop fine and season. Boil from half an hour 
to an hour. The water can be drained off when they are half 
done, and fresh water added if desired. 

BROCCOLI. 

Cut the heads with short stalks, peel off the hard outside skin, 
which is on the stalk and small branches, wash them, boil them fif- 
teen minutes, tie the shoots into branches, add a little milk or cream, 
and stew gently for ten minutes more until the stalks are tender. 
It should be eaten, like asparagus, on toast with drawn butter. 

BUTTERED CABBAGE. 

Boil cabbage with a quanity of onions, then chop them together, 
season with pepper and salt, and fry them in butter. It is a rather 
homely but savory dish, and is frequently used with fried sausages 
laid over it, or as an accompaniment to roast beef 

A CABBAGE RELISH. 

Take the stalks of cabbage, scrape them, leave them in the wa- 
ter all night, and the next day cook them like vegetable marrow, 
and they will be found very good. 

A RED CABBAGE RELISH. 

Put the cabbage sliced into a stewpan, with sliced onion accord- 
ing to taste ; add half a teacup of vinegar, and let it simmer four 
or five hours, stirring frequently. When dished, add a little flour 
and butter. 

RED CABBAGE STEWED. 

After slicing a small red cabbage, and well washing it, put it 



VEGETABLES. 139 

5nto a saucepan with pepper, salt, and butter, but no more water 
than will hang about it after the washing. Cover it closely, and let 
it stew two or thre^ hours or until very tender, and shortly before 
serving 'add two or three spoonsful of vinegar, and give it one boil 
over the fire. It may be served with cold meat, or with sausages 
on it. 

FRENCH aVBBAGE 

Boil together as many different vegetables as are convenient, but 
with them must be a pint of split peas, and a cabbage cut into 
quarters, and tied with thread. Add two spoonsful of nice olive oil, 
melted butter, or cream, pepper, and salt. When cooked enough, 
pour off the liquid, (which save for another time,) and leave the 
rest to stew. 

VEGETABLE MARROWS. 

Peel the marrow, then divide down the centre, and take the 
seeds out; cut the marrow in pieces, boil until quite soft, then 
drain in a colander until all the water is out ; beat well with a fork 
and season with pepper, salt, and a lump of sugar. They are also 
very nice sliced and boiled, then laid upon toast, with melted but- 
ter poured over, like asparagus. 

VEGETABLE MARROW TART. 

Peel and core the marrow, cut into small pieces, boil until quite 
soft, drain the water well from it, and beat with a fork until all the 
lumps are out. Have ready three eggs, well beaten with a little 
milk, mix with the marrow until it is in the consistency of custard ; 
sweeten it, and add a little grated nutmeg ; pour into shallow dishes, 
lined with short paste, similar to baked custards. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Break off the green leaves, cut the flower close at the bottom, 
from the stalk ; if large, divide into four quarters. Put into cold 
water, let it lie not over an hour, then put into boiling milk and 
water, or water only — milk makes it white — skim while boiling. 
When the stalks are tender, take it up, which must be done before 
it loses its crispness. Lay it on a cloth or colander to drain, and 
serve with melted butter. 



140 VEGETABLES. 



RAREBIT CAULIFLOWER 

Put into a frying pan, amidst boiling grease, a few small mush- 
rooms or mushroom buttons, and the flower part of a cauliflower 
or broccoli, broken into sprigs. Sprinkle over them some grated 
cheese, and baste the whole well from time to time with the hot 
grease. This is a delicious food, and very nutritious. 



PASTRY. 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 



A great deal has been said lately against puddings and pies, 
and desserts generally. People have been warned against them 
as unwholesome ; long catalogues of diseases, — in fact, all the ills 
that flesh is heir to, have been laid to their charge ; and all, we 
verily believe, without any more reason than could be given for 
stopping the use of fuel, because some people are careless enough 
to set fire to their dresses, or their houses. 

The dessert is to many people the most important part of the 
dinner ; it is always so to children, and there is no reason why it 
should not be just as healthy, just as digestible as the dinner. In 
fact, there are many persons, who neither eat puddings nor 
pies themselves, nor allow their children to eat them, who will yet 
compel them to swallow tough, ill-cooked meat, soggy potatoes, 
and bread, heavy, sour, and indigestible, as so much lead. 

Eating is not merely a duty, it is one of the pleasures of life ; 
and pains should be taken by every housekeeper to make it a 
source of as much enjoyment as possible. The dessert is the holi- 
day part of the dinner ; it is a subject of expectation and antici- 
pation — it affords an opportunity of making up for a rather slim 
first course, and often drives away the unpleasant remembrance of 
a cold leg of mutton, or impenetrable beef-steak. 

Of course, it requires a little time and judgment — every detail 
of housekeeping does, and should be adapted to the dinner which 
has preceded it. 

When the meal is hot, — and hearty, a light, simple dessert is 
suflicient, but when it consists of cold meat, or some make-shift 
warmed up from the previous day, nice fruit puddings, and home- 
made pies, deep and good, are very welcome. ^ 



142 PASTRY. 

We always suspect a man wlio does not like pie or pudding, just 
as we would a woman that did not love children ; he is sure to be 
cross, and hard to manage, difficult to please, and never feels good 
natured, not even after his dinner. 

Solid flour puddings are always doubtful. They are too heavy 
for this climate, unless made a very important part of the dinner. 
Desserts require to be fruity, — fruity in substance, fruity in flavor. 
We do not condemn all pastry, but in puddings and pies, the more 
fruit and less paste, the better. 

Fruit alone makes a very good dessert ; and when in the season, 
and plentiful, a very cheap one. Apples, grapes7 melons, pears, 
and peaches, are all fine for dessert, and can be used singly, or 
combined, according to means, and occasion. 

Nuts, with apples, are excellent in winter ; but nuts should never 
be put on the table alone, — they are not only indigestible, but with- 
out juicy fruit as an accompaniment, unpalatable. A disb of ap- 
ples, or oranges, will be found a very welcome addition to a des- 
sert composed of any kind of pie or pudding in which fresh fruit 
is not an ingredient, such as plain rice, corn starch, custard, and 
the like. 

Bread and butter, apple-sauce, and a cup of tea, winds up a 
family dinner very nicely, on washing or any other day, when it is 
not convenient to have anything else. 

But whatever your dessert is composed of, be careful to have it 
put upon the table with due ceremony. Children are great observ- 
ers of small matters of etiquette, and quickly notice the difference 
between company, and family manners. Do not, because " there 
is no one present," allow it to be huddled upon the table, amidst a 
confusion of meat and vegetables, without changing the plates, or 
the knives and forks, and brushing off the table cloth. Go through 
"all the motions." A little ceremony in families is a good thing ; 
it preserves the respect of the members for themselves and each 
other ; it prevents the familiarity which breeds contempt, and teaches 
children how to behave away from home. If circumstances require 
a degree of hurry which compels you to waive ceremony, apologise 
as you would to friends, were they present, and request the other 
members of the family to proceed as usual. 

But be sure, young housekeepers and young mothers, not to 



PASTRY. 143 

relinquish your pies and puddings, it is one way of appealing to, 
and winning the hearts of husbands, and children. Moreover, 
acquire the practice, and as a general rule make them yourself. 
There are very few servants that can be trusted with the use of 
the materials required, or who can make the same article twice alike. 
It is also a privilege which a good wife and mother will not like 
to forego, to compound the particular dish of which husband and 
children are so fond, and which they will always remember in con- 
nection with her kind heart, and skillful hand, as long as they live. 
Who that has lived to man's or woman's estate, but remembers 
something which *' mother " used to make, the like of which no one 
could make or ever will again, and in nineteen cases out of twenty 
it is some especial pie or pudding. 

POTATO PIE CRUST. 

Put a tea-cupful of rich sweet cream, to six good sized potatoes 
after they have been well boiled, and mash fine. Add salt to 
taste, and flour enough to roll out the crust. Handle it as little as 
possible. It is better not to put crust at the bottom of a pie if 
the fruit is very moist, for it will be clammy from the moisture, but 
let the under crust only cover the rim of the plate. Prick the up- 
per crust to let out the steam, else the juice will run over. This 
paste is excellent for apple dumplings, or meat pies, and may be 
eaten by the most fastidious dyspeptic. 

PUFF PASTE. 

Take four ounces of the best wheat flour, four ounces of sweet 
butter ; divide the butter into three parts ; take one of the three 
pieces and rub it into the flour with the hand, till well mixed ; 
then stir in a table-spoonful of water, and form with a spoon into 
a very stiff paste ; put it on a marble table or a very smooth board, 
and roll it out once each way ; fold the four ends inwards, and roll 
first lengthways, and then sideways ; spread on half the remaining 
butter in little pieces, sprinkle with flour, fold and roll as before ; 
spread on the rest of the butter and repeat the process ; now fold 
and roll twice, and put it away to cool for ten minutes . Roll out 
the paste very thin, and it is ready for whatever use required. 



144 PASTRY. 



CRUST FOR RAISED PIES. 

• Take two ounces of lard, two ounces of butter ; put both togeth- 
er into a stewpan with a tea-cupful of water to boil ; mix it with 
one pound of sifted flour while it is boiling hot, first with a spoon 
and then with the hand. Roll out as other crust for pies. 

SUET CRUST FOR MEAT PIES. 

Take the fibre from eight ounces of soft beef suet, and pound it 
to a soft mash ; mix it with one pound of fine flour ; then make the 
crust in the same way as for puff paste, using the pounded suet in- 
stead of butter. It may be used for a pie at once, without setting 
it aside to cool. 

MINCE PIES. 

Mince pies are not healthful, and one batch in a season is quite 
suflicient. A shin of beef boiled down till very tender, one pound 
of nice clear beef suet chopped very fine, a table-spoonful of salt, 
six pounds of greening apples peeled, cored and chopped, three 
pounds of raisins stoned, three of currants carefully cleaned, one 
pound of brown sugar, a cup of maple syrup, half a pound of cit- 
ron, shredded, half a pound of candied lemon peel, a quart of the 
best cider. This mixture makes rich pies, but mince pies are noth- 
ing if not rich. These are also particularly fine in flavor. In- 
stead of cider, some persons put in a quart of Madeira wine, and 
a little brandy ; but it is better not to use alcohol in food when it 
can be avoided. 

ENGLISH MINCE PIES. 

Three and a half pounds of good chopped beef, three and a half 
pounds of suet, three and a half pounds of raisins, three and a 
half pounds of currants, seven pounds of apples chopped, one 
pound of candied citron, two pounds of sugar, one ounce of nut- 
megs, four quarts of good cider, one pint best vinegar, salt, a pint 
of golden syrup. Half the raisins should be stoned and chopped, 
the other half left whole. 

The quantity, of course, may be reduced or increased ; for ex- 
ample, by giving five, or seven pounds of beef, to fourteen pounds 



PASTKY. "" 145 

of apples. Fven this proportion added to the others makes splen- 
did pies. To our taste, the proportion of suet is altogether too 
large, one pound, especially if a shin of beef is used, being am- 
ple to secure rich pies. No common spices, such as cloves, or all- 
spice, should be employed. 

MRS. D.'s MINCE PIES. 

Five pounds of beef, three of apples, one of suet, two of raisins, 
two of currants, one tea-spoonful of salt, two of cloves, two of 
mace, two of cinnamon, two of allspice, one tumbler of brandy, 
one cup of wine, two pounds of sugar, one pint of molasses. 

SQUASH PIE. 

Having pared the squash and removed the seeds, stew it till soft 
and dry, then pulp it through a colander. Stir into the pulp 
enough sweet milk to make it thick as batter ; spice with ginger, 
cinnamon, nutmeg, or whatever is liked ; sweeten with sugar, and 
add four well-beaten eggs for each quart of milk used. Fill a 
pie-plate lined with crust and bake for about an hour. 

CUSTARD PIES. 

Very nice custard pies are made with two eggs, and two largo 
table -spoonsful of corn starch to a quart of milk ; sweeten and 
spice to taste ; add also salt ; the corn starch should be mixed 
smooth with milk and the eggs beaten up in it, then thin out with 
more milk ; sweeten, season, pour into pans lined with paste, and 
grate nutmeg over the top. 

^ APPLE CUSTARD PIES 

Grate, or stew to a pulp, twelve large apples ; to this add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, sugar, nutmeg, three eggs well beaten, a pint of 
cream or milk, and a table-spoonful of melted butter, the grated 
rind of two lemons and the juice of one ; pour the mixture into 
plates lined with rich paste, and arrange strips in a network over 
the top ; bake a light brown, and sift over them powdered sugar. 

LEMON PIE. — 1. 

One lemon, one orange, one sour apple, all peeled, seeds taken 
7 



146 PASTRY. 

out, and sliced thin ; put them in a sauce mn with one teacupful 
of water, and stew till soft ; set aside to cool, and add half a tea- 
cupful of sugar, same of molasses, and a table-spoon heaping full 
of flour; this makes one pie the size of a large dinner plate. 

LEMOX PIE. — 2. 

One cup of hot water, one table-spoonful of corn starch, one cup 
of white sugar, one table-spoonful of butter, juice and grated rind 
of one lemon. Cook for a few minutes ; add one egg, bake with a 
top and bottom crust. This is for one pie. 

KITTY may's lemon CREAM PIE. 

The juice and grated rind of one lemon, one cup of white sugar, 
the yolks of two eggs, three table-spoonsful of sifted flour, milk to 
fill the plate. This makes a large pie, and shouiJ be made with 
an under crust, but not any top crust. Bake until nearly done, 
then take from the oven, and pour over it a frosting made of the 
beaten whites of the two eggs, and two table-spoonsful of powder- 
ed sugar, then set back in the oven, and brown lightly. One of 
the best pies ever eaten. 

SWEET APPLE PIE. 

Pies made of sweet apples used in precisely the same way as 
pumpkins, omitting the ginger and Kdding a little lemon, if liked, 
for seasoning, are better to the taste of some than pumpkin pie 
itself. Pare cut, and stew the apples. If cooked in a covered 
deep earthen or other dish in the oven, they are better. Strain 
through a colander, add a little milk, cream is better. If there be 
no eggs to spare, stir in a handful of flour, or about a spoonful to 
a pie. Sweeten Jp taste. 

\ GREEN APPLE PIE. — 1. 

Grate raw, six good apples, add a cup of sugar, three table- 
spoonsful of melted butter, four eggs, a little lemon juice, a few 
dried currants, and a little spice ; line plates with a paste, fill and 
bake without an upper crust. One or two tea-spoonsful of brandy 
may be used in the pie if desired. 



PASTRY. 147 

gJIeen applj pie. — 2. 

Take ripe and rather tart apples such as pippins, russets or 
greenings ; pare, core, and cut them into very thin slices, fill the un- 
der crust, throw over them slices of fresh lemon, cinnamon, and 
plenty of white sugar ; lay on the upper crust and bake in a mild 
oven. " 

ENGLISH APPLE PIE. 

Lay some paste crust round the sides of a deep dish ; quarter 
the apples and take out the cores. Put in a thick layer of apples, 
cover with half the sugar you intend for your pie, some lemon 
peel grated fine and a few cloves ; then put in the rest of the ap- 
ples and sugar, and add a little lemon juice ; boil the cores and 
peelings of the apples in water with a blade of mace, until they 
are soft, then press it through a colander ; boil it with sugar, and 
pour it in the pie with a little quince or marmalade. Put on the 
upper crust and bake. 

FRUIT PIES. 

Fruit pies should be eaten fresh and baked in tolerably deep 
earthen platters. Their excellence consists in a small quantity 
of pastry and a large amount of fruit and sugar. Line the dish 
with good paste, leaving half an inch to project over the edge. 
Fill with fruit, and cover thickly with sugar ; no spice is needed 
for fresh small fruit pies. Put on a lid of puflf paste, and bring 
the outer edge of the under paste up and over it, moistening 
slightly with cold water, so that it will fasten down tight. This 
prevents the juice from boiling out. Notch the edge and center. 

< ^^ CHERRY, PLUM, OR GOOSEBERRY PIE. "(English method.) 

Make a good crust and lay a little around the sides of a deep 
W dish. Cover the bottom with sugar, and lay in the cherries, 
plums, or gooseberries whole, sprinkle sugar over the top and 
bake in a moderate oven. 

WHORTLEBERRY PIE. 

Wash and pick over the berries, place them an inch thick on the 



148 PASTRY. 

under crust, cover them thickly with sugar, put on the upper crust 
and bake half an hour. Other berry pies, such as blackberry and 
raspberry, are made in the same way. They require no spice ; but 
we think whortleberries are greatly improved by having a few red 
currants, or the juice of a lemon sprinkled among them. Sift 
powdered sugar over all fruit pies before serving. 

PUMPKIN PIES. 

Take a small pumpkin, or half of a large one, stew long and 
slowly, then strain it, after peeling, and cutting it in small pieces. 
Mix with this quantity of pulp, one quart of sweet milk, three eggs, 
and two table-spoonsful of corn starch mixed first smooth with a 
little of the milk. Salt, sugar, and ginger must be put in to taste. 
A large cup of sugar is about right ; one nutmeg. The ginger is 
indispensable to a genuine pumpkin pie. If part cream can be 
used the pie is much richer, as well as more delicate in flavor. 

Bake with an under crust only. 

r 

COCOANUT PIE. 

For three pies one quart of milk, five eggs, one grated cocoa- 
nut. Beat the eggs and sugar together to sweeten, and stir into 
the milk when hot ; then add the cocoanut and spice. Put it in a 
rich paste, and bake twenty minutes. 

GRAPE PIE. 

Pop the pulps out of the skins into one vessel, and put the skius 
into another. Then simmer the pulp a little and run it through a 
colander to separate the seeds. Then put the skins and pulp to- 
gether and they are ready for jugging, or for pies. Pies prepared 
in this way can hardly be distinguished from plum pies. 

RHUBARB PIE. 

Take oflf the thin skin, cut the stalks in small pieces, add a little 
flour, place it in the pie. When the paste is done remove the top 
crust and add sugar and butter, mixing it thoroughly with the rhu- 
barb. Put the top crust on and serve warm. A little nutmeg may 
be grated over the top of the fruit before putting on the crust, if 
it is relished. 



PASTRY. 149 



MOCK APPLE PIE. 

Two soda crackers, one egg, one cup of sugar, and one of 
water, the juice and yellow rind grated of a lemon. This a good 
recipe for Spring use. 

DRIED APPLE PIES. 

Wash the apples in two or three waters, and put them to soak 
in rather more water than will cover them, as they absorb a great 
deal. After soaking an hour or two, put them into a preserving 
kettle with the same water, and with the thin peel of one or two 
lemons, chopped fine. Boil tender; when they rise, press them 
down, but do not stir them. When tender, add sugar, and boil 
fifteen or twenty minutes longer. Dried apples, soaked over night, 
are made tasteless, and are mashed up by being stirred. When 
cooked, stir in a little melted butter, some cinnamon, and powdered 
cloves. It is important that the apples should be of a tart kind. 

DRIED PLUM PIES. 

Soak the plums, and stew them gently ; season them with spice 
and sugar to taste ; put a pufi* paste on to the plate ; then put a 
layer of the plums, stewed ; roll out a piece of paste thin, cover 
them, add another layer of plums, and cover for the last time. 
You may have as many stories to your pie as you choose. 

CORN MEAL PIES. 

Stir a small tea-cupful of very fine ground Indian meal into two 
quarts of boiling milk ; when nearly cool add four beaten eggs, 
and sweeten to taste, like a custard, adding spice and orange peel, 
if desired. Bake with a crust like custard pie. 



PUDDINGS. 



BUFFALO PUDDING. 



A quart of flour, two tea-spoonsful of baking powder, a table- 
spoonful of maizena, a salt spoon of salt, a piece of butter the size 
of a small egg, and cold water ; mix the baking powder with the ' 
flour thoroughly, put in the salt and maizena, and mix to the con- 
sistency of drop cake. Have the butter melted and stir into the 
mass. In berry time, drop a part of this mixture in a tin pail, or a 
steamer if you have one, which has been buttered, then put in a 
layer of berries doing up with batter. In the winter, chopped 
apples, dried currants, or any kind of dried fruit are an excellent 
substitute. Zante currants will not require previous soaking, but 
common garden fruits will. Steam the pudding for one hour and 
a half, and serve with liquid sauce. A pudding can be steamed in 
a tin pail, y inverting and old tin cup, and setting the pail upon 
it in the pot. Be sure that the water boils and keeps boiling, and 
that the pail is covered tight by its lid. This pudding contains nei- 
ther milk nor eggs, yet, if properly made, it will be thought by the 
best judges to possess both. When mixed with milk however, it 
is whiter than when mixed with water. 

ENGLISH APPLE PUDDING. 

Make a paste of a pint of sifted flour, a quarter of a pound of 
finely chopped beef suet, a little salt, and cold water. Line a 
pudding bowl, fill with tart apples cut in quarters. Sprinkle a lit- 
tle sugar on the top, cover with paste, and boil an hour and a quar- 
ter. Turn out, and serve with a sweet liquid pudding sauce, spiced 
•with lemon, and ginger.

a tea-cup of cold water, and bake thirty minutes. No sauce. 

POOR man's pudding. 

Take some stale pieces of bread, pour boiling water over them, 
and cover down tight. When they have absorbed the water, and 
become soft, mash them to a pulp. Mix in one table-spoonful of 
corn-starch, one egg, a cup of milk, a little salt, some sugar, and a 
few currants cleaned by rubbing in a colander -vith some flour. 
Bake in a dish with a few small pieces of butter on the top, and a 
little nutmeg grated over. It is good hot or cold, and when cold, 
will turn out, and cut like an English cheese-cake. It is also inex- 
pensive.

stiif froth, then add by degrees first the sugar and then the ap- 
ples ; beat all together for an hour, until, when taken up in the 
spoon, it stands quite stiff. With the yolks of the two eggs make 
a sweet custard for the bottom of t]ie dish, and build the snow up 
by spoonsful to any height you please. Savoy cakes and sweet- 
meat likewise laid in the dish are an improvement.

glassful of orange-flower water ; when these ingredients have been 
properly mixed, pour the whole into a flat dish, and, when cold,

heaping table-spoonsful of corn starch, and two beaten eggs. 
Place on the fire meantime a quart of the skimmed milk, in a thick, 
lined saucepan, and when it comes to a boil, mix rapidly and 
smoothly with it the eggs and corn starch, allowing it to boil up 
once. Pour into a mould or small oval dishes which have been 
wet with cold water to prevent sticking. A little salt is an im- 
provement. Set away in a cool place, and it will turn out clear 
and quivering. Eat with the cream taken from the milk and pow- 
dered sugar. This is a cheap, easily made, and delicious summer 
dessert.

vanilla. Set tbe pudding in the oven, and brown the frosting a 
delicate color. The colder when eaten, the better. 

ICE PUDDING. 

Boil one pint and a half of new milk with one tea-spoonfid of 
isinglass. Beat five eggs and mix them with the milk as you would 
for custards. Take a tin mould with a cover, oiled, not buttered, 
and line it with candied fruits, such as plums, green gages, etc. 
Then pour the custard in very gradually, so that the fruit will re- 
main at the bottom. Put on the cover and bury the mould in ice 
for the whole day, only turning out the pudding at the moment it 
is wanted.

PUDDINGS. 165 



THE poet's pudding. 

Well sugar any summer fruit, and fill a deep tart dish with layers 
of it alternated with thin slices of the inside of a light stale loaf; 
let the upper layer be of fruit, and if it is a dry kind, sprinkle 
over it a dessert-spoonful of water or a little lemon juice. Rasp- 
berries, currants, or cherries will not require this. The sugar must 
be used according to the sweetness of the fruit. For a quart of 
ripe green gages, split and stoned, five ounces will be sufficient. 
Bake in a quick oven about half an hour. 

THE pastor's pudding. 

Wash and pare some rhubarb stalks, cut them into short lengths 
and put a layer of them in a deep dish, with one or two spoonsful 
of sugar ; cover evenly with thin slices of a roll, then add a thick 
layer of fruit and sugar, then one of bread, then one of rhubarb, 
and then cover with a thick layer of fine bread crumbs mixed with 
a table-spoonful of sugar. Pour over a little clarified butter, and 
bake thirty or forty minutes. Good apples sliced, sweetened and 
flavored with nutmeg and lemon rind, and covered with well but- 
tered slices of bread, make an excellent pudding of this kind. 
Black currants may also be used, leaving out the butter. 

BOILED INDIAN PUDDING. 

A quart of sour milk, half a cup of molasses, a cup of raisins, a 
cup of chopped suet, a tea-spoonful of saleratus, and meal enough 
to make it stiff. 

PLAIN INDIAN PUDDING. 

Seven table-spoonsful of sifted Indian meal, scalded with boil- 
ing water until the quantity is thoroughly wet ; add three pints of 
new or skimmed milk, cold, two thirds of a cup of molasses, little 
salt, four eggs. Some persons think a little chopped suet improves 
it. Place it in the oven, with a moderate heat, and bake it slowly 
three hours. After being in the oven a half hour stir it from the 
bottom, as that is apt to thicken at first. Eat with butter. 

NANTUCKET CORN PUDDING. 

Take two dozen ears of young corn, husk, and grate or pound

it fine; add three pints of new milk, cold, one half tea-cup of 
brown sugar, a little salt, two soda crackers pounded fine, six 
eggs ; put it in the oven, with a moderate heat and bake three 
hours. Eat with butter. 

MRS. HOWITT's pudding. 

Butter lightly on both sides, some evenly cut slices of roll, or 
of light bread freed from crust, and spread the tops thickly and 
evenly with orange marmalade. Prepare as much in this way as 
will cover the surface of the pudding without the edges of the 
bread overlaying each other, as this would make it sink to the bot- 
tom of the dish. Pour in a custard of two well-beaten eggs, new 
milk, a pinch of salt, and two ounces of sugar. Flavor with 
French brandy only. Let it stand an hour, then place it carefully 
in an oven and bake it until it is set, and no longer. Too fierce a 
heat will spoil it. The bread should be a light, clear brown, and 
the custard under it smooth and firm. 

BOILED APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

Select apples that will cook quickly, pare and core them, leav- 
ing the apple whole. Prepare a plain paste, roll the crust about 
quarter of an inch thick, cover each apple with it, and then steam 
them about an hour; if you boil them instead of steaming them, 
make the paste of suet, put them in boiling water, and boil an hour. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

Select smooth, even-sized apples ; peel, core them, and fill the 
cavities with sugar, and a little cinnamon. Divide your paste into 
as many parts as you have apples. Roll each one out square, and 
inclose the apple in it, slightly wetting the edge, to make it stick. 
Bake them in a shallow pan, and eat with a dry sauce made of 
butter and sugar beaten together. 

APPLE miTTEllS. 

Beat three eggs very light, then stir in one tea-spoonful of salt, 
one table-spoonful of sugar, the grated rind of half a lemon and 
the juice, one pint of milk, one half pound of chopped apples, one 
half pound of sifted flour ; stir it well together, and fry in lard, 
or can be baked on a griddle as pancakes. 



PUDDINGS. 167 



LEMON DUMPLINGS. 

Mix with ten ounces of fine bread crumbs, half a pound of beef 
suet, chopped fine, R large table-spoonful of flour, the grated rinds 
of two small lemons, or one very large one, four ounces of pound- 
ed sugar, or if wished very sweet, more ; three large or four small 
eggs beaten and strained. Divide these into four equal portions, 
tie in well-floured cloths, and boil an hour. 



PUDDING SAUCES. 



MAPLE SUGAR SAUCE. 



Take half maple sugar and half light brown sugar, boil them 
together with a little water, clarify the syrup with an egg, strain it 
and melt a small piece of butter in it. All maple sugar, or all 
common sugar can be used. It is very good on puddings. 



CHERRY SAUCE. 

Take ripe cherries, mash them with the meat of the pits in their 
own juice until tender, pulp through a sieve all that will pass, add 
wine and sugar, and spice if desired, and boil until it is of the con- 
sistency of thick cream. 

HARD SAUCE. 

This is made simply by stirring together to a light cream two 
cups of pounded loaf sugar to half of a large cup of sweet butter. 
It may be flavored according to taste. For cream and plain bat- 
ter pudding it may be thinned with a few spoonsful of boiling wa- 
ter and flavored with vanilla. Nutmeg is the best flavor for apple 
puddings. For rice puddings a little lemon juice or wine may be 
added. 

SWEET LIQUID SAUCE. 

One table-spoon of flour mixed smooth with cold water, a pinch 
of salt, piece of butter the size of a hickory-nut, half a cup of sugar, 
and a little maple or other syrup. Stir into this mixture hot wa- 
ter enough to make a pint bowl of sauce ; boil all up, and grate in 
lastly a little nutmeg. 

AN EXCELLENT PUDDING SAUCE. 

Beat up, as for hard sauce, white sugar with butter, until very 



PUDDING SAUCES. . 169 

light, in the proportion of half a cup of butter to one of sugar ; 
flavor with essence of lemon or bitter almonds. Fifteen minutes 
before serving, set the bowl in a pan of hot water on the range, 
and stir it till hot. It will raise in a white foam to the top of the 
bowl. 

WINE SAUCE. 

Take half a cup of butter and two cups of sugar, beat them to- 
gether and mix in slowly a cup of wine ; melt all over steam but 
do not stir it while melting. 

BRANDY SAUCE. 

This can be made the same as wine sauce, or as follows ; Heat 
over steam in a covered saucepan half a pint of brandy, beat two 
eggs, and beat together to a cream two cups of sugar, and half a 
large cup of butter ; stir the eggs into it, add also the brandy, mix- 
ing quickly and thoroughly. Keep it in hot water until needed. 

ROSE HIP SAUCE. 

Take rose hips, open them and take out the seeds, soak them 
and boil them to a paste, pulp them through a seive and stir them 
in boiling wine with sufficient sugar, until of the consistency of 
thick cream. 

LEMON BRANDY. 

This is used for flavoring sweet dishes. Fill a wide-necked bottle 
with very thin rinds of fresh lemons, cover with good brandy, and 
after two or three weeks strain off the spirit and cork it for use. A 
few apricot kernels are sometimes blanched and added with the 
lemon peel to give a good flavor. 



DESSERT DISHES. 



CREAM PUFFS. 

For shells : a pint of boiling water ; melt in it half a pound of 
lard, and stir, while boiling, into this, three-quarters of a pound 
of flour. Boil until a thick paste is formed. The best way to boil 
it, is to set one kettle in another, or a pail in a kettle of boiling 
water with the ingredients in the pail, as in boiling a custard. When 
thick, take from the fire, and when cool add ten eggs, and a little 
salt. Mix thoroughly, and bake in a quick oven for twenty-five 
minutes ; oven about as hot as for pies. This makes five dozen 
cakes. Drop with a spoon, on buttered tins, some distance apart. 
When cool open carefully with a knife, and fill with mock cream, 
which is made as follows : 

One quart of milk, four eggs, three-quarters of a pound of white 
sugar, five ounces of flour, extract of vanilla to taste. Make a 
smooth paste of flour, in some of the cold milk ; put in a kettle of 
boiling water with all the milk ; when thickened a little, add the 
eggs well beaten with the sugar. When creamy it is done. Take 
from the fire, and add a little extract of vanilla. Do not use until 
cold. 

This is the only receipt for making cream puffs that we have 
used with success. But this never fails, if the directions are 
followed ; and when done they are nice enough to set before a 
king. 

PASTIES. 

Rub a quarter of a pound of lard into two pounds of flour ; 
beat the whites of two eggs light, and mix in two half-pints of 
water ; wet the flour, leaving out some to work the crust with ; 
take one pound of butter ; roll out the crust four times, eacli time 
putting in with a knife a quarter of the butter ; use flour freely, when 



DESSERT DISHES. 171 

rolling out ; cut it round, lay in your preserve or apple, which must 
be dry ; turn over the paste, to join a half circle ; nip the edge 
with the thumb and finger, to confine the preserve ; dip the hand 
in water, pass it lightly over the paste, then sift sugar thick upon 
them, and bake in a quick oven. 

CUSTARD. 

Use about four eggs to a pint of new rich milk. Flavor the milk 
hy putting six young laurel leaves, or grated lemon peel into it, 
before beginning to make the custard, and leaving them in until it 
is done : sweeten the milk with an ounce or more of sugar accord- 
ing to taste. Beat up the eggs thoroughly with sugar and add the 
milk to it boiling hot. Place all in the saucepan, and stir it over a 
slow fire until it begins to thicken. Then remove it from the fire 
and continue stirring it until it is of exactly the right thickness. 
Turn it out immediately and keep stirring it until it is cool. 

BOILED CUSTARD. 

Put one quart of milk over the fire ; when it steams up, add the 
yolks of nine eggs and four table-spoons of sugar, well beaten 
together. Stir the mixture well till it thickens. Remove it from 
the fire, and set away to cool. Add flavor and salt to taste. To 
make it extra nice, beat up the whites of the eggs with some ex- 
tract of lemon and sufficient powdered sugar to make it stiff. Di- 
vide it over the custard cups. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

Make a nice syrup ; cut up your apples very fine, and boil them 
in the syrup with a peel of a lemon, till perfectly transparent ; 
when done, put it into a large tumbler, or a mould, and the next 
day it will be solid ; turn it into a glass dish and pour over it a 
rich soft custard ; if you choose, put a whip and some bits of cur- 
rant jelly on the top. 

CHOCOLATE KISSES. 

One pound of sugar, two ounces of chocolate, pounded toge thcr 
and finely sifted ; then mix, with the whites of eggs, well beaten 
to a froth. Drop this on buttered paper, and bake slowly. 



172 DESSEKT DISHES. 



LEMON SPONGE. 



Soak half an ounce of gelatine in a pint of water for an hour, 
then add a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, the rind and juice of 
a large lemon ; put in a pan and simmer on the fire until the ge- 
latine is dissolved ; strain it into a large pitcher, let it remain until 
it is quite a jelly, when the white of an egg must be added, and 
the whole whisked thoroughly well for an hour ; put into moulds 
previously rinsed in cold water. When turned out it should look 
like snow. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM CUSTARDS. 

Scrape quarter of a pound of the best chocolate, pour on it a

pounds of sugar, boil the apples sufficiently in it to mash, take 
them out, beat them fine, ptrt them back, cut six oranges into small 
pieces, and boil all together, stirring it till done. 

BAKED APPLES. 

There is nothing better for a simple ordinary dessert than plain 
baked apples. Wash the apples, and place them whole without 
peeling in the baking dish sprinkled with sugar, with a little water 
added for sauce and bake until quite soft. A good way is to cut 
out the stem, leaving a little cavity; fill this with sugar and place 
three layers in the dish, the stem end up. Sprinkle over some 
more sugar, add a little water and put a slice of lemon over each 



180 DESSERT DISHES. 

apple in the top layer ; first, slightly squeezing the juice over the 
apples. Water enough may be used to supply a sauce, although 
they are delicious with cream if that can be obtained. Sweet ap- 
ples are usually much preferred for baking instead of tart ones, 
though this is in some degree a matter of taste. 

STEWED APPLES. 

Make a clear syrup of half a pound of sugar to one pint of wa- 
ter. Skim it; peel and core the apples without injuring the 
shape. Let them be in cold water till the syrup is ready, to which

hair sieve, mix in sugar; when cold stir in sweet cream and serve 
cold. 

DRIED APPLES STEWED.

are better flavored with a few dried quinces or peaches. Orange 
peel or lemon is excellent for flavor. 

STEWED PIPPINS. 

Pare and quarter golden pippins, remove the core, stew them 
over a slow fire with sufficient sugar to sweeten, the juice and- 
rind of a lemon and a little water, let them cook till very tender.

ter to preserve their color. Take a pint of water, and half a 
pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Place it on the fire in a 
stew pan and bring it to a boil before the fruit is put in. Now 
take the apples out of the cold water and put them in the syrup ; 
and add one ounce and three quarters of cleaned ginger, for each 
pound of fruit. Let them boil till they become clear, an hour or 
less. If not used immediately, put them in a jar closely covered 
down, and set in a cool, dry place. They will keep some time. 



DESSERT DISHES. 181 



FLOATING ISLAND OP APPLES. 



Bake or scald eight or nine large apples ; when cold, pare them 
and pulp them through a sieve. Beat this pulp with sugar, and 
add to the whites of four or five eggs previously beaten, with a 
small quantity of rose water, or essence of lemon ; mix this into 
the pulp a little at a time, and beat it until quite light. Heap it 
up on a dish, with Savoy cakes, and jelly under, and around it. 

APPLE SNOW BALLS. 

Take six apples pare and quarter them and cut out the cores 
completely. Place the quarters together in the shape of the ap- 
ple before, and in the cavity made by removing the core put a 
clove and a slice of lemon peel. Have six small pudding-cloths 
at hand, and half pound of rice, and cover the apples severally, 
one after the other in an upright position, with rice, tying them up 
tight. Then place them in a large saucepan of scalding water, 
and let them boil for one whole hour. On taking them up, open 
the tops, and intermix with the fruit a little grated nutmeg, with 
butter and sugar to your taste. 

COMPOTE OF APPLES. 

Boil a sauce pan of clarified sugar, half sugar and half water on 
the fire ; skim it, have ready the apples pared, cut in halves, and 
cored, drop them in the syrup and let them boil very slowly. Take 
them oflf when done, and let them cool ; if the syrup is too thin, 
give them another boil. 

NINA's APPLE CREAM. 

Take two pounds of apples, pare and core them, slice them into 
a pan, add one pound of loaf sugar, the juice of three lemons, and 
the grated rind of one. Let these boil about two hours. Turn it

and all,) and butter them. Peel, core, and cut up sufficient of. 
nice baking apples in proportion. Take a pie dish, line it with 



182 DESSERT DISHES. 

bread and butter. Next make a layer of apples at the bottom, then 
of sugar, then of bread and so on, till the dish is filled. Bake 
until the apple is perfectly soft, then before serving, turn it out 
into a dish. It ought to keep its shape, and eat almost like a 
sweetmeat, all the ingredients being thoroughly blended in baking. 

APPLE CHEESE. 

Take equal weights of apple and sugar ; boil the sugar in water, 
take off the scum as it rises, and when it is clear, put in the apples 
with some lemon juice and peel, and boil until it is all of a proper 
thickness. 

A cream for this cheese may be made by putting to a pint of 
cream or new milk, the yolks of two eggs, a stick of cinnamon, a 
spoonful of rose water, and the peel of a lemon ; let it quite boil, 
and when it is cool, sweeten it to taste, and pour it over or around 
the cheese. 

SARATOGA APPLE SAUCE. 

Take two pounds of apples, boil them with as little water as 
possible, and make them into apple sauce, then add a pound and a 
half of sugar, and the juice of a lemon ; boil all together till quite 
firm, and put it into a mould. Garnish it with almonds stuck over 
it. It will keep for many months, if allowed to remain in the 
mould. 

BAKED PEARS. 

Take any kind of pears, wash them, and place them whole and 
without peeling, in the baking tin, with merely the water that will 
hang on them after washing. Sprinkle sugar over them, and bake 
until quite soft. A syrup will be found in the bottom of the dish, 
which may be poured over them. They are better and more 
wholesome- than any complicated pastry. 

SCALDED PEARS. 

Wash the pears, whole, and without pealing ; boil them in just 
enough water to cover tliem, until they are soft, then pour in molas- 
ses, sufficient for a sauce, boil up until it is thick, and serve the 
pears in a dish, with the sauce poured over them. 



DESSERT DISHES. 183 



TO MAKE A TRIFLE. 



Make a boiled .custard not very thick and let it cool. Break in 
pieces some Naples biscuits, some macaroons in halves, add ratifia 
cakes, cover the bottom of a dish with them, and wet with white 
wine ; pour the custard over them, and put a syllabub over it. It 
can be garnished with currant jelly, and if convenient with flowers. 

GOOSEBERRY OR APPLE TRIFLE. 

Scald the fruit, pulp it through a sieve, and add sugar to taste. 
Make a thick layer of this at the bottom of the dish. Mix a pint 
of milk, a pint of cream, and the yolks of two eggs, scald it over 
the fire, stirring it well ; add a small quantity of sugar, and let it 
get cold. Then lay it over the apples, or gooseberries, with a 
spoon, and put on the whole a whip made the day before. If you 
use apples, add the rind of a lemon grated. 

RHUBARB TART. 

Pare off the thin skin, and cut it in small lengths, stew them an 
hour very slowly ; to one pint of rhubarb add, while simmering, 
a syrup of sugar, and a little water ; when done let it cool, then 
make it into tarts. 

ICING FOR TARTS. 

Beat the white of an egg with a quarter of a pound of powder- 
ed sugar, and flavor with two spoonsful of almond, or lemon ex- 
tract, stir them together one way till the mixture is quite thick, and 
then lay it on the tarts with a feather or a bunch of feathers, then 
let the tarts stand in a mild oven until hard, but not long enough 
to become discolored. 

COMPOTE OF RHUBARB. 

Take a pound of the stalks after they are pared, and cut them 
in short lengths, have ready a quarter of a pint of water boiled 
gently for ten minutes, with five ounces of good lump sugar, or six 
ounces if the fruit is very tart ; put it in and let it simmer for 
about ten minutes. 



184 DESSERT DISHES. 



COMPOTE OF RED CURRANTS. 

Make a syrup of a pint of water and five or six ounces of lump 
sugar, boiled ten minutes. Simmer a pint of currants, freed from 
the stalks, from five to seven minutes. They are an excellent ac- 
companiment to a pudding of batter, custard, bread or rice, or to 
boiled rice. A compote of raspberries may be made in this way, 
or raspberries may be mixed with the currants. 

COMPOTE OF GREEN CURRANTS. 

Make a syrup of half a pint of spring water and five ounces of 
lump sugar boiled together ten minutes. Strip a pint of green 
currants ftom the stalks, and simmer them in the syrup five min- 
utes. 

COMPOTE OF GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. 

Make a syrup of half a pint of water, and five ounces of good 
lump sugar broken fine, boiled together gently for ten minutes, and 
skimmed. Simmer gently in this syrup for eight or ten minutes a 
pint of gooseberries freed from tops and stalks and well washed 
and drained ; these compotes will only keep good two or three days ; 
transparency of the fruit will be increased by using more sugar in 
the syrup. 

COMPOTE OF PEACHES. 

Pare them, and remove the stone, boil gently until tender, take 
them off and put them in cold water. Then put them in clarified 
sugar, add a little boiling water, set them again over the fire, and 
when done enough, pour them out into dishes. 

CHERRY CHEESE.

shallow pots, and keep in a dry place. 



DESSERT DISHES. 185 



GOOSEBERRY FOOL. 

Put into a deep dish some green gooseberries, a quart or more 
if desired, after baking them in the oven until quite soft, pulp 
them through a colander and add pounded sugar to taste. When 
it is cold, raix in a gill of cream to each quart of berries, and serve 
in a glass dish. 

PINEAPPLE FRITTERS. 

Take quarter of a pound of fine flour, one and a half pints of 
new milk, the yolks of four fresh eggs, and make the same into a 
light battter, adding the whites of two eggs, first beaten into a 
light froth. Bruise half a dozen slices of a round ripe pineapple 
into a pulp and stir it well up with the batter, adding at the same 
time a little nutmeg and cinnamon grated fine. Put the pan over 
a brisk fire, and ladle out the batter into the pan as it may be re- 
quired, according to the size of the fritters. Fry them in fresh 
butter turning them only once, when they will assume a brown, 
crisp complexion. When quite done remove them into a dish, 
sprinkling over them a dessert-spoonful of powdered loaf sugar. 
Apple and currant fritters can be prepared after a like manner. 
The cinnamon can be dispensed with if objected to. 

ORANGE FRITTERS. 

Take three oranges, or more if desired, peel them, and pick off 
the white part without breaking the thin inner skin ; then tear 
them into the natural divisions of the orange ; each one will make 
from seven to eight pieces. Dip each into a light batter; fry 
them in hot fat, not too brown. Serve as soon as convenient with 
sifted sugar over them. 

STEWED PRUNES. 

Soak the prunes in cold water, if not very dry, for one hour ; 
but if they are old a longer time is necessary. Stew them, closely 
covered with a thin syrup, with lemon peel chopped finely, for three 
hours. 

GOOD COMMON PRESERVE. 

Boil together in equal or unequal portions any kinds of early 



186 DESSERT DISHES. 

fruit until they can be pressed through a sieve, weigh the pulp and 
and boil it over a brisk fire half an hour, add half a pound of sugar 
for each pound of fruit, again boil it quickly, stirring and skim- 
ming, from fifteen to twenty minutes ; cherries if used, should be 
stewed tender apart, as they require a longer time than other sum- 
mer fruits. 

A NICE AND CHEAP DESSERT. 

Cook a teacup of rice very thoroughly, putting in water first, 
afterwards milk, and a little salt. When it is done to a jelly, add 
a table-spoonful of currant-jelly, or half a teacup of any fruit- 
juice, that Is of a bright color ; and put it over the fire a few min- 
utes. Turn it into a mould, to cool ; and eat with sweetened 
cream, or cream and dry white sugar. 

ANOTHER. 

Tie a cup and a half of rice, which has been well washed, in a 
bag with a few raisins. Allow plenty of room to swell, and boil 
an hour or more. Turn out, and pour over it some boilling syrup, 
in which a small piece of butter has been melted. 

LOPPERED MILK. 

A delicious summer dessert consists simply of milk which has 
thickened^ take it out quivering, like custard, and eat with cream 
and white sugar. It must not be allowed to wTieij, as it is then not 
loppered but sour milk. It is a favorite dish in Germany. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

It is not necessary to urge upon any one the eating of this de- 
licious fruit; everybody, man, woman, and child, anticipates the 
season with pleasure. But we should like to urge upon all who 
possess a few feet of ground the wisdom of cultivating a " straw- 
berry patch." So great a gift, so profusely bestowed in return for 
a little labor, ought to be shared by the poorest. We hope the 
time will come when fruit will be so plentiful and so cheap that it 
can be picked by the weary, thirsty traveller on the roadside. 
Why should not apple-trees, cherry-trees, plum-trees, peach-trees, 
and pear-trees be planted along the unsightly fences, hiding them,

and supplying God's good gifts, without money or price, to those 
who need them ? The man who shall first endow his farm in this 
way will, at small cost, become a public benefactor, and establish 
a claim to immortality. But to return to strawberries : this is so 
perfect a fruit, so exquisite in flavor, so excellent in quality, that 
cooking, or manipulation of any kind, rather impairs than improves 
it. A little white sugar and cream is the only addition that can 
be made, and even this is a concession to our unnaturally sweeten- 
ed and perverted palates, rather than to the necessities of the case. 
As for strawberry pie, strawberry dumpling, strawberry pudding, 
and the whole range of dishes in which strawberries are cooked^ 
they should be stricken out of every housekeeper's list, with a sin- 
gle reservation in favor of " strawberry cake," in which, however, 
the strawberries are not cooked, and which is so great a pet with 
the male as well as female part of every household, that we dare 
not say a word against it, even if it was not one of our own special 
weaknesses. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. 

Mix dough as for soda buscuit ; that is to say, one quart of sift- 
ed flour, piece of butter size of an egg, two tea-spoonsful of 
cream of tartar, one of soda, a pinch of salt, and sweet milk to 
form a soft dough. Put cream of tartar in the flour, and soda in 
di-y also, and, when thoroughly mixed, roll out half an inch thick 
and bake in a shallow pan fifteen or twenty minutes ; have ready 
two quarts of fresh, fine strawberries; split the cake, place half 
the strawberries between and cover thickly with white sugar and 
cream ; put the other half on the top and cover in the same way ; 
send to the table immediately. This is the method of making at 
the finest city restaurants. 

FRXHT FOR DESSERT. 

Add a little water to the white of an egg, and beat it well ; dip 
the fruit in and immediately sprinkle it all over with powdered 
sugar. Then leave it for four or five hours, and serve with cus- 
tard, loppered milk, or ice corn-starch pudding. Large and fair 
bunches of red and white currants make a charming dish in this 
way. Strawberries, blackberries, cherries or raspberries, are ei- 
ther of them suitable. 



188 DESSERT DISHES 



SUMMER FRUITS MIXED. 

Take fine, fresh strawberries, white and red currants, and 
white or red strawberries ; strip them carefully from the stalks, 
and heap them high on a dessert dish in layers, strewing each lay- 
er with sifted sugar. Before serving lay thick cream entirely over 
the fruit, and gently stir them with a spoon when served. Some 
use instead of cream two wine-glasses full of Sherry, Madeira or 
any other good Avhite wine. Either currants or strawberries by 
themselves, are good, prepared in this way. 

RHUBARB, OR PIE PLANT. 

This Is one of the greatest of spring luxuries, though the quan- 
tity of sugar required to be used with it renders it rather expen- 
sive. Remove the stringy part and cut up into small slices either 
for stewing or pies, no spice is required, but sugar may be put in 
as long as your conscience will let you, and a handful afterwards. 

QUINCES FOR THE TABLE. 

Bake them ; remove the skin, slice them and serve with cream 
and sugar. 

APPLE PIQUE. 

Peel and stew some apples, but do not let them break. Place 
them in a glass dish half full of syrup, and put a piece of currant 
jelly on the top of each apple. 

TOMATOES. 

These can be eaten raw, when ripe, with salt, pepper and vine- 
gar or sugar. By pouring boiling water on them, the skin can be 
taken off, then cut them in pieces and cover them with powdered 
sugar. 

A DESSERT OF CHESTNUTS 

Boil Spanish chestnuts very soft and pulp them through a sieve. 
Beat the whites of eggs with pounded white sugar, to a thick froth 
pile the chesnuts in a dish, and cover thickly with the whip, just 
before stirrins:.

LEMON PASTE TO KEEP. 



To one pound of butter, put one pound of loaf sugar, six eggs 
(leaving out the whites of two,) the rind grated, and the juice of 
three lemons. Put all in a pan, and let simmer till the sugar is 
dissolved, and it thickens to the consistency of honey. Put it into 
pots, and close them air tight. 

LEMON FLAVOR. 

When lemons are plenty procure a quantity, cut them into thin 
slices, and lay them on the plates to dry in the oven; when dry 
put them into a tight bag or close vessel, in the store room, where 
they are both handy and agreeable for almost anything. 

TINCTURE OF LEMON OR ORANGE PEEL. 

A fine flavor for cake, sauces, and the like, may be easily, and 
cheaply obtained, by taking a thin rind oflf any lemons, or oranges, 
that may be used, and putting it into a bottle half full of brandy, 
or proof spirit. J& few weeks will suffice to impregnate it very 
strongly with the flavor. 

COUNTRY ICE CREAM. 

Any family having ice and milk, can make ice cream without a 
freezer as follows : Scald two quarts of fresh milk, — if a little 
cream be added all the better, — stirring in three table-spoonsful of 
com starch or arrow root, to give it body. These may be omitted 
if not at hand. Stir well to keep from burning. Beat up four to 
eight eggs, according to convenience, and pour the scalding milk 
on the eggs, stirring well. When cold add sugar and essence of 
lemon, or extract of vanilla, to suit the taste, and a very little salt. 
Pour the cold contents into a deep tin pail, or can, holding about 
three quarts ; put on the cover, and set in an ordinary water pail. 
Pound up ice to the size of hens' eggs and less, some, of course, 
will be quite fine ; pack it around the tin can, mixing in about one 
pint of either medium or fine salt ; pack this till it reaches nearly 
to the top of the can containing the mixture to be frozen, but be 
careful none enters it. Now move the tin can or pail around by 
means of its bail, lifting the cover occasionally to scrape off the 



190 DESSERT DISHES. 

frozen cream on the inside, so that other portions may come in 
contact with the freezing surface. From fifteen to twenty minutes 
will be sufficient, and the dish may be served up at once or set 
away, without removing from the wooden pail, in a cool place for 
several hours, covered with a flannel cloth. 

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 

Take two pounds of fresh strawberries, carefully picked, and 
with a wooden spoon rub them through a hair sieve, about half 
pound of powdered sugar, and the juice of one lemon ; color with 
a few drops of prepared cochineal ; cream, one pint. When the 
sugar is dissolved, ascertain that the sweetness is correct ; then 
freeze. This will make a quart. "When fresh strawberries are not 
in season, take strawberry jam, the juice of two lemons, cream, to 
one quart. Color, strain, and freeze. 

APPLE ICE. 

Take nice apples, grate them, make them very sweet and freeze 
them. Pears, peaches, and quinces can be done in the same way. 

MOLASSES CANDY. 

Boil slowly a quart of molasses, stirring occasionally. To find 
when it is done, drop a spoonful of it into some cold water ; if it 
breaks brittle, take it off. Have some flat pans well buttered, pour 
the candy hot into them, and set it aside to cool. When nearly 
cool, take it from the pans and stretch it for a long time until it be- 
comes a clear light color. While boiling, it can be flavored accord- 
ing to taste, or mixed with nuts or pop corn. A small piece of 
alum put in will make it more brittle. 

SUGAR TAFFY. 

Dissolve three pounds of sugar in a pint of water, in which half 
a teaspoon of citric acid has been dissolved ; boil it, and remove the 
scum. When it will crack after being dropped in cold water take 
off, and squeeze and mix in the juice of three lemons ororanges. 
Boil again until thick as before, then pour into buttered pans, in a 
thin layer. Mark it off into square blocks before it cools, so that 
it will break regularly. 



DESSERT DISHES. 191 



LEMON DROPS.

flavor it with lemon, then'pour it in small drops on buttered paper,

Throw into a well-heated metal mortar, from two to four ounces 
of the best quality of cake chocolate, broken small, and pound it 
with a warm pestle until it resembles a smooth paste or very thick 
batter ; then add an equal weight of sugar, in the finest powder, 
and beat them until they are thoroughly blended. Roll the mixture 
into small balls, lay them on sheets of writing paper, or upon 
clean dishes, and take them off when nearly cold. While soft, the 
tops may be encrusted with white nonpareil comfits. 

SYRUPS FOR CANDIES. 

To a pint of cold water put two pounds of loaf-sugar, let it dis- 
solve, add the white of an egg and beat the mixture well. Put 
it on the fire, when it boils up take it off and remove the scum. 
Put it on the fire again, let it boil up and throw in a few, drops of 
cold water ; take it off again and remove the scum, and so contin- 
ue until no scum rises. 

BARLEY SUGAR, {foY Children.') 

Soak a quart of barley over night, in the morning boil it gently 
in more water, until it becomes a clear and rather thin jelly. Add 
to this two pounds of sugar, and the juice of a lemon, and boil 
again, until clear and stiff, so that when poured out in buttered 
plates or saucers, it will set hard. The white of an egg improves 
it.

NEW year's BISCUITS. 

Boil a pound and a quarter of lump sugar, upon which you have 
rubbed the rind of a lemon, in half a pint of milk ; when cold, 
rub half a pound of butter with two pounds of flour, make a hole 
in the centre, pour in the milk, with as much carbonate of soda as 
would lie upon a sixpence, and a couple of eggs ; mix the whole 
into a smooth paste, lay it out upon your baking-sheet in what- 
ever flat shapes you please, and bake them in a very warm oven. 
The proper way to shape these biscuits is by wooden blocks hav- 
ing pineapples, leaves, and other devices carved on them.

nearly as large as a walnut ; stamp them flat with a small stamp, 
and bake them in a slack oven. 

APPLE BISCUIT. 

Boil apples in water until soft, then take them out and rub 
through a wire sieve ; flavor with a drop or two of essence or of 
of leraon, and, if you like the taste, a drop of the oil of cloves. 
Add lump sugar equal in weight to the pulp, and grind it with it ; 
roll the sugared pulp into flat cakes about a quarter of an inch 
thick, and cut them into shapes. Finally dry them in a very slow 
oven, the heat not being strong enough to bake them or melt the 
sugar; they may be dried also by the summer's sun. They often 
require to be partially dried before they can be rolled out. They 
may, instead of rolling, be dropped on to paper, or put in a ring 
of paper upon a slightly greased iron plate. 

ORANGE BISCUITS. 

Grate the rind from five oranges, and put into a mortar with 
quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, three quarters of a pound of 
pounded lump sugar, and the whites of one or two eggs, and mix it 
well together with the pestle until it is very light. Drop the mix- 
ture, when ready, in small lumps about the size of a walnut, on 
doubled paper, laid on a baking tin, and put them into moderately 
hot oven. Do not drop them too near together on the paper, as 
they spread while baking. When they are baked take them out, 
and take them off the paper when they are cold. 

MOSS BISCUITS.

of butter and five ounces of sugar, rub them well together, and 
mix with one whole and one white of egg, and a tea-spoonful of 
milk ; then add two ounces of ground almonds, which rub well 
into the paste ; afterwards rub the whole through a gauze wire 
sieve, taking it off in small pieces, which lay upon a lightly butter- 
ed baking sheet, and bake them in a moderate oven.

on tins in a quick oven. 

judge's biscuits. 

Break six eggs into a basin, whisk them well for five minutes ; 
put in half a pound of powdered sugar, and whisk again for ten 
minutes. Add some cararway seeds, if liked, and half a pound 
of dry sifted flour, mixing all thoroughly. Drop the mixture on 
paper, each being the size of about a silver quarter dollar and 
high in the middle. Sift sugar over them and bake them. Remove 
them from the paper while they are hot. A wooden spoon is the 
best to stir with. 

king's biscuits. 

Put half a pound of butter Into a basin and turn it about well. 
Whisk six eggs well, add half a pound of powdered sugar, whisk 
another ten minutes, and then mix with the butter, after which

a good dough by much kneading ; roll and cut into biscuits half an 
inch thick, bake quickly. 

MACAROONS. 

Scald a pound of almonds, let them lie awhile in cold water, 
then dry them, and mash them together. Moisten them in the 
white of an egg to prevent them turning into oil, and then take 
an equal quantity of powdered sugar, and the whites of four eggs . 
Mix the whole well together, shape them on wafer-paper and bake 
on thin plates in a mild oven. 



SWEET CAKES. 211 



COCOANUT CAKES. 



Scrape off the rind and grate the nut quite fine, and mix it with 
half its weight of finely pounded white sugar, and the white of an 
egg. Drop the mixture on wafer paper in rough pieces, the size 
of a nutmes:. and bake it in a moderate oven. 

ICING. 

To ice a good sized cake, put eight ounces of powdered sugar 
into a mortar with four spoons fuls of rose water, and the whites of 
two eggs, beating and straining it. Th*en whisk it well, and when 
the cake is almost cold cover it with the iceing evenly, using a 
feather or knife. Put it in the oven to harden, but not long enough 
to discolor it, and keep it in a very dry place. 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 

A cup of milk, a quarter of a pound of good chocolate, one cup 
of powdered sugar, one tea-spoonful of vanilla. Scald the milk 
and chocplate, then add the sugar, and pour it on the well-beaten 
white of an egg. This will ice a good sized cake or pudding. An 
almond iceing is given in the receipt for a bride cake. 



PRESERVED FRUITS AND SWEETMEATS. 



CANNIXG FRUIT. 



Tills new method recommends itself, not only on account of its 
health, but its economy, especially since the price of sugar has 
become so enormous as to be almost prohibitory. Properly put up 
in the right kind of cans, there are many fruits which require no 
sugar, and even the most acid only a very little, say, one fourth of 
the weight ; it should, however, be of the finest quaUty. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

Use the zinc-covered, self-sealing jars, as the covers of these 
can be screwed down without difficulty, while the jars are in the 
water, and Ave have never known fruit to spoil in them. 

Fill the jars with fruit and sugar in the proportion of one pound 
of crushed sugar to four pounds of fruit. Set them in cold water 
(a wash boiler is as good as any thing for the purpose) ,' which heat 
to boihng. The jars, by the way, should not be filled to within an 
inch of the top, and when the boiling process, by expelling the air, 
has forced the fruit up to the top of the jar, it is exactly the time 
to put on the cover, and with a small holder in the left hand, to 
keep the fingers from being burnt, screw it tight down, before 
taking the jar from the water. 

Cherries, raspberries and plums, may be preserved in precisely 
the same way ; peaches and pears also, omitting the sugar, which 
they do not require, as they keep just as well without. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. ^ 

Separate the hulls from the berries, for each pound of berries 
weigh out three quarters of a pound of pounded sugar ; put the 



PRESEBVED FRUITS. 213 

berries in a deep dish sprinkling the sugar among it, and lot them 
remain ten or twelve hours, then boil them together half an hour 
very slowly. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

This should be made in the same manner as strawberry jam. 
Let it boil, after it commences to do so, fifteen or twenty minutes ; 
another way is to bruise together a quart of raspberries, and a 
pint of currant jelly ; boil them slowly six or seven minutes, stirring 
them ; then put into close pots. This will keep two years. 

STRAWBERRIES IN CANS. 

Half a pound of sugar to every pound of berries ; scald them 
together, fill the cans while hot, and seal at once. 

DRIED STRAWBERRIES 

Put ten pounds of strawberries into a jar, and sprinkle among 
them four pounds of white sugar. Let them stand until the next 
day, then scald them and put them back into the jar. On the third 
day, put another pound of sugar over them and scald them again, 
pour out on plates, or dishes, and dry them in a cool oven, or the 
back part of the range. They must be kept in tin canisters, and 
■will make a very good dessert dish in winter. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. . 

Boil the strawberries gently until thick, and very much reduced ; 
add loaf sugar, three quarters of a pound to a pound of fruit, and 
stir constantly, until it is reduced to a paste. Put in small jars, 
and cover with egg paper — that is paper covered on the under 
side with white of egg^ — and tie down a second paper over them. 

PRESERVED RASPBERRIES. 

Take five or six pounds of red, but not too ripe raspberries ; 
pick and put them into a preserving pan, with an equal weight of 
clarified sugar ; when they have boiled up about a dozen times, 
skim and pour the whole into a pan, till the next day ; then drain the 
fruit and put it into jars ; put to the syrup about two glasses of 
cherry juice, previously strained ; boil the sugar again, and pour it 



214 PEESERVED FEUITS. 

over the raspberries ; add allerwards about a spoonful of currant 
juice to each pot, and when cold, lay on brandy paper, and tie 
them down. 

CURRANT AND RASPBERRIES SWEETMEAT. 

Take equal weight of red currants and raspberries, and of 
sugar, three quarters of a pound of best loaf, to each pound of 
fruit. Cover the fruit with the sugar over night, and the next day 
boil all together slowly for an hour, skimming if necessary. Put in 
small jars, and fasten down while hot, with egg, or brandy paper. 
It will keep well, and makes a delicious sweetmeat. 

CHERRY JAM. 

Stone four pounds of Kentish cherries, add to them half a pint 
red currant juice and a pound of fine sugar, and boil all together 
briskly till the mixture becomes stiff. 

GREEN GRAPE JAIM. 

Put the grapes in a jar, and let them cook in a kettle of boiling 
water, until they are soft, and can be separated from the seeds. 
Strain through a fine colander, and to every pound of grape, put a 
pound of crushed sugar. Boil all together very gently, until a thick 
jam is formed, and then put in small moulds, or glasses, and cover 
with egg paper. 

PLUM JAM. 

Prepare the plums by skinning and stoning them, allow three 
quarters of a pound of finely pounded loaf sugar to one pound of 
fruit ; lay them in a deep dish over night with the sugar sprinkled 
among them, and in the morning let them boil twenty minutes, 
after they have become sufficiently hot to bubble over their whole 
surface. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Cut the pineapple into small slices and then into square pieces, 
removing all the skin and eyes. Allow three quarters of a pound 
of loaf sugar to a pound of pineapple, and boil them very slowly 
twenty-five or thirty minutes. 



PRESERVED FRUITS. 215 



BLACK CURRANT JAM. 

Boil together for quarter of an hour after it commences to bub- 
ble, stirring well a mixture composed of a pint of juice of red cur- 
rants, and a pound and a quarter of pounded loaf sugar, to each 
pound of currants. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Stone the fruit, weigh it, and for every pound, take three quar- 
ters of a pound of loaf sugar. First dissolve the sugar in water, 
in the proportion of a pint of water to a pound and a half of sugar. 
Then add the fruit, and let it boil as fast as possible for half an 
hour, till it begins to jelly, as it soon thickens by keeping. Put it 
in pots, cover with brandy paper next the fruit, and then closely 
from the air. 

PICKLED CHERRIES. 

Procure white ** ox-heart" cherries, leave the stems on, and 
prepare for eight pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar, two quarts 
very best vinegar, a little cloves and double the bulk in cinnamon, 
mace and ginger root. Boil the vinegar, sugar and spices, skim- 
ming thoroughly. Put the fruit in bottles, strain the syrup over 
it, screw them down, and put them in a kettle of boiling water for 
ten minutes. When they look like cracking they are done. 

PINE APPLE MARMALADE. 

Boil together for each pound of grated pineapple a pound of 
double refined loaf sugar. When it is boiled thick, which will be 
in about fifteen minutes, if the quantity is small, or more if large, 
put it in tumblers, and paste over them papers wet with the beaten 
whites of eggs. Keep it in a dry, cool place. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Peel and core them, put in the kettle, and cover them with the 
parings, cores, and considerable water. Cover close and boil till 
tender ; then take out the quinces, strain off the liquor, and to 
every pint add one pound of loaf-sugar. Boil it a few minutes, 
skim, put in the quinces, and boil slowly twenty minutes, or until 
they are clear. 



\ 



216 PRESERVED FRUITS. 



CRAB APPLES PRESERVED. 

Weigh the apples, and with an equal weight of sugar make a 
syrup with apple jelly, and after this is well boiled, prick the crab- 
apples and put them into it. When they have boiled a few min- 
utes, take them out, and let thorn drain on a sieve. Put them 
again into the syrup, when they are nearly cold, and after boiling 
a few minutes more, drain them as before. Repeat this process a 
third time, and afterwards place them in glasses or jars, pouring 
the boiling jelly over them. 

BRANDY GAGES. 

Take green gages, wash and wipe them dry, prick them on opposite 
sides and pack them in bottles or jars, with mouths large enough 
to let the fruit in without pressing. Prepare a very rich syrup, 
let it cool to blood heat, mix in the proportion of one third syrup 
to two of brandy, mix thoroughly, fill the bottles, cork, and seal 
perfectly air tight. If syrup is left, bottle it for future use. If 
the skins are tough remove them. 

PRESERVED PINEAPPLES. 

Peel the pineapples, cut out the eyes, slice them and cut out the 
hard centre. Then boil them till tender ; skim the liquid and add 
to it three quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of pine apple. 
Boil it, skim it again and put in the fruit, and boil it till clear of 
soft, or put in lemons and one pound of sugar. 

GREEN FIGS PRESERVED. 

Take half ripe figs, and prick them near the stalk, scald them and 
when half cold throw them into cold water and let them drain. 
Boil clarified sugar in a covered preserving pan, put in the figs, let 
them boil three or four times ; then take them from the fire, skim 
them well and put them in a warm place over night. In the morn- 
ing drain off" the syrup, boil it up a dozen times, and when luke- 
warm pour it on the figs. Let it stand till the next day, drain it 
off and boil it up again, then add the figs to it, boil them together 
once in the covered preserving pan, skim again, and put in jars 
for use. 



PRESERVED FRUITS. 217 



TO PRESERVE PLUMS OR DAMSONS WHOLE. 

Weigh your fruit, and to every pound allow three quarters of 
crushed sugar. Put into stone jars alternate layers of fruit and 
sugar, tie down with cloth, and let them stand in an oven after 
bread has been baked in it, until it is cold. The next day strain 
oflf the syrup, boil and clarify it, and pour over the fruit, which in 
the mean time has been carefully removed to glass jars or china 
pots. Place over them egg tissue-paper, and over that thick white 
paper pasted, or bladder tied strongly down. 

Another method is to put the plums into water over a slow fire 
until they begin to peel, keeping them under the water, then take 
the skins off carefully and put them into a jar with enough thin 
syrup to cover them completely. Boil the syrup next day, put the 
plums in, boil gently, allow them to stand till cold ; repeat the pro- 
cess, turning them in the syrup till nearly cold. Take the plums 
out, strain the syrup, add more sugar, skim it, put the plums in 
again and boil them till they become quite clear, then put them in 
jars and tie them down with paper. 

CLTIRANTS PRESERVED. 

Scald a few of the currants at a time until all are done, put su- 
gar into the juice in the proportion of a pound of sugar to a pound 
of currants, and boil a few minutes ; then put the currants back 
into the syrup, and boil them up once. 

RHUBARB PRESERVED. 

Pare half a dozen oranges, remove the seeds and white rind, 
slice the pulp into a stew pan with the peel cut very small. Then 
add a quart of rhubarb cut fine, and a pound and a half of loaf 
sugar ; boil the whole down as for other preserves. This is almost 
equal to Scotch marmalade. 

ORANGES PRESERVED. 

To preserve oranges whole, grate the rinds slightly, and score 

them round with a knife, or cut the rinds into scollops or any other 

pattern, not cutting deep ; then put them into cold water for three 

days, changing the water two or three times a day ; afterwards tie 

10 



218 PRESERVED FRUITS. 

them up in a bag, and boil them in water until a pin's head will 
penetrate their skins easily. Take a pound and a half of white 
sugar to every pound of oranges, and while they are boiling, put 
the sugar on the fire with rather more than half a pint of water 
to each pound. Let it boil a minute or two, and then strain it 
through muslin. Then put the oranges into the syrup, and boil 
until the syrup will jelly and is of a nice yellow color ; it cannot 
be too stiff. The syrup need not cover the oranges, but they must 
be turned so that each part gets thoroughly done. 

PICKLING PEARS AND PEACHES. 

This is a very nice way of preserving these fruits, particularly 
for those who like such a relish with cold meats. Select smooth 
freestone peaches, and medium sized juicy pears, and stick them 
full of cloves, that is to say, like pins upon a pincushion, heads up ; 
and perhaps half an inch apart. Boil together, either the syrup 
left from dried fruit, and vinegar, in the proportions mentioned in 
the receipt for drying plums and small fruit, or seven pounds of 
good Orleans sugar to one gallon of good vinegar, an ounce of 
mace, and an ounce of allspice. When it boils, put in the fruit, 
and let it all boil gently together, until a pin will slip in and out 
easily. Then take the fruitout in jars, boil the spiced and sweet- 
ened vinegar for a few minutes longer, and then pour over fruit 
and set it away to cool. When cold, fasten thick paper over the 
lids with paste or mucilage. 

DAMSON PLUMS, (To picJde.) 

To two pounds of plums, take one pound of brown sugar, and 
one pint of vinegar, tea-spoonful of mace, one of cinnamon ; boil 
them well, and pour it on the fruit hot ; when cold, drain it off, 
boil it and pour it on again, repeating it six times. 

PEACHES DRIED WITH SUGAR. 

Peel yellow peaches, cut them from the stone in one piece, allow 
two pounds of sugar for six pounds of the fruit, make a syrup of 
three quarters pound of sugar and a little water, put in the peaches 
and let them stay till they are quite clear, take them up carefully 
on a dish and set them in the sun to dry. Strew powdered sugar 



PRESERVED FRXnTS. 219 

over them on all sides, a little at a time, and if any syrup is left re- 
move them to fresh dishes. When they are quite dry lay them 
lightly in a jar with a little sugar between each layer. 

TO DRY PLUMS AND SJIALL FRUITS. 

A very good method is to pit them, and put in jars, a layer of 
fruit to a layer of sugar, in the proportion of half a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Let them stand twenty-four hours, and then 
boil them, taking the scum off, as it rises to the surface. When 
they have boiled ten minutes, take them out of the syrup, drain 
them, and spread them thin on dishes, or hair sieves, to dry in the 
sun ; they will need turning every few hours, until dry. 

The syrup that is left can be used, in the proportion of a large 
pint to a small quart of good vinegar, for pickling pears or peach- 
es, — the method for doing which is explained in the receipt under 
that head. 

Another method for drying plums, peaches and apples, is to 
prepare them nicely, by pitting or peeling and cutting, dry them 
partly, and then lay them in jars, strewing sugar between each lay- 
er. Tie them down, and they will keep well, and be delicious for 
pies, or stewing. 

Some people are troubled with insects among fruit, when it is 
kept a long time. A handful of sassafras bark thrown among it 
will keep it free from worms. 

PRESERVED CITRON. 

Pare ripe citron melons, and cut them into half-moon shaped 
pieces, about half an inch in thickness. Boil in soda water until 
tender, when a straw will pass through them ; skim them out and 
lay them in weak alum water ; let them remain three hours ; then 
put them in cold water for another hour. Then take on^ quart 
of water, four pounds of sugar, and the same weight of citron ; 
boil this syrup and remove the scum ; when clear put in the citron^ 
let it remain till the sugar has penetrated it thoroughly ; then pack 
it in jars. Boil the syrup until it is ropy, and pour it in the jars. 
Flavor with extract of ginger. Add to each quart jar a table- 
spoonful of extract of lemon peel, and seal them as soon as filled, 
with paper wet in egg. 



220 PRESERVED FRUITS. 



APPLE SWEETMEATS. 



Procure fresh gathered ripe apples, of a fine sort ; peel them, 
take out the cores, and cut them in quarters ; place them in a pre- 
serving pan with a glass of water, a little lemon or orange peel, 
and a pound of sugar to a pound and a half of fruit. Let it boil 
thoroughly, and then put it into preserve pots. 

APPLE PRESERVE. 

Peel and weigh ten pounds of apples ; stew them in a pan, with 
one pint of water ; when they are quite tender put in eight pounds 
of pounded suger, two ounces of ground ginger, the juice and 
grated rind of four or five lemons ; let it boil half an hour or more, 
stirring it all the time, then put it in small jars or moulds. 

APPLE BUTTER. 

Take ten gallons of new sweet cider, before it has fermented ; 
put it into a brass kettle ; if the kettle will not hold all of the ci- 
der, put in a part, and set it a-boiling ; skim it, and as it boils 
away keep adding, until you have put in all the cider ; boil down 
to about five gallons. For the ten gallons of cider, take half a 
bushel of quarters of apples ; part quince gives it a fine flavor. 
Now wash and drain the apples, put them into the boiled cider, 
and when they are soft, it must be stirred constantly until finished. 
It requires a stick formed in such a way as to keep moving on the 
bottom of the kettle, to prevent the apple from sticking and burn- 
ing. Have a slow fire, and attend carefully to the stirring at the 
bottom of the kettle. If for winter use, from one to two hours* 
boiling, after the apples first begin to boil, is suflicient ; or a long- 
er time if thought proper. Before taking it from the fire, season 
with spice, cinnamon and cloves, to suit the taste. Remove the 
kettle from the fire, dip the apple butter while hot into well glazed 
crocks, or stone jars ; then set away to cool. When cold, cut pa- 
per covers for each crock ; soak it in apple-jack, lay it inside of 
the vessel, on the apple butter, and cover it close. A barrel of 
cider may be boiled down to about ten gallons, observing the same 
proportions as given above. 



PEESERVED FRUITS. 221 



TO PREVENT WASTE IX APPLES. 

An excellent way to prevent waste in apples, is to pick out all 
that are beginning to speck, peel, cut up and stew as for sauce, 
and fill into air-tight cans. As canned fruit is used through the 
fall and winter, the cans can be re-filled in this way with apples, 
and in that way they will be preserved, for pies or sauce till summer. 

PRESERVED PIPPESTS. 

Pippins and bell-flowers make a delicious preserve. Take half 
a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, make a syrup in which 
boil the fruit till clear, take out the fruit and boil the syrup till 
thick ; add extract of lemon to taste, and pour over the fruit to 
prevent the necessity of long boiling, which injures the taste and 
looks of presers'cs ; they can be put while boiling into tin cans and 
sealed. 

PRESERVED CUCUJIBERS. 

Split the cucumbers and extract the seeds. Let them remain 
for three days in salt and water. Put them now into cold water, 
with a small quantity of alum, and boil them till tender. Drain 
them and allow them to lie in a thin syrup for two days ; then take 
them out, boiling the syrup again, and pour it over the cucumbers, 
repeating this operation twice more. Now boil some clarified su- 
gar until, when a spoonful of it is taken up and blown through, 
small sparks of sugar will fly from it ; put the cucumbers into this 
and let them simmer five minutes. Leave them until the next day, 
when the whole must be boiled up again, and afterwards put by 
for use. 

VEGETABLE MARROW PRESERVED. 

Soak the vegetable marrow twelve hours in salt and water, then 
pare it, remove the seeds and soft part, cut it into small, thick, 
square pieces. Boil it in water until tender, put in a little prepared 
cochineal to color it ; then strain it. Make a syrup of powdered 
sugar, boil in it two sliced lemons and a quarter of a pound of 
whole ginger ; when cold, put in the vegetable marrow and let it 
stand two days. Pour off the syrup, add more sugar to it, boil it 



222 PRESERVED FEUITS. 

again and add it*to the vegetable marroAV ; remove the vegetable 
marrow, boil it up several times till the syrup is strong and trans- 
parent, and the last time you do so boil the vegetable marrow in 
the syrup. An equal weight of sugar and vegetable marrow is 
used in making the syrup. 

TOMATO FIGS. 

Take pear shaped, or small single tomatoes, scald and skin them, 
then to half a peck or eight pounds of them, take three pounds of 
brown sugar. Cook them with sugar over a fire without water, 
until the sugar penetrates and they are clarified. Take them out, 
spread on dishes, flatten them and dry in the sun. Sprinkle on a 
little syrup while drying, after which pack down in boxes treating 
each layer with powdered sugar ; the syrup that is left can be boil- 
ed down and bottled for use. They will keep from year to year, 
retaining their flavor, which is nearly like that of fresh figs. 

PRESERVED ARTICHOKES. 

Cook them half done, then separate the leaves from the fur and 
preserve the fleshy part called "the bottom," and turn them still 
warm into cold water to make them firm. Afterwards put them in- 
to the oven four different times, when they will become thin, hard 
and transparent. They may be eaten raw with salad sauce. 

CANDIED ORANGE PEEL RINGS. 

Cut some Seville oranges in half, remove the pulp, and let the 
peel soak for three days in strong salt and spring water. This 
must be repeated three times, after which the peel should be plac- 
ed on a sieve to dry. Put one pound of loaf sugar to one quart 
of water, boil it, and skim it until quite clear. Double the orange 
peel, and cut it across in narrow strips which, when opened, will, 
of course, form rings. Let these simmer in the sugar until quite 
transparent, and then dry them before the fire. Make a syrup of 
the best loaf sugar using only enough water to dissolve it ; and 
while it is boiling put in the rings, stirring continually until the 
sugar is candied round them, then put them to dry before the fire 
or ina cool oven. 



PRESERVED FRUITS. 223 

PREPARING CITRON FOR CAKE. 

Boll the citron in soda water until it is clear or tender, bave 
ready a nice syrup of sugar ; put in the citron, and boil until the 
sugar has struck through it ; take it out on plates to dry slowly, 
sprinkle pulverized sugar on both sides, two or three times until it 
is dried enough. Then pack it in wooden boxes, with sugar be- 
tween the layers. It is nearly as nice as bought citron. 

FRIED PmiPKIN. 

Select the ripest and largest. Peel and stew them dry, then 
spread out on plates and dry in a cool oven until all the moisture 
is extracted. It will then be a dry, hard, thin layer, which may 
be packed away in tin cans, or boxes, in a diy place until re- 
quired for use. Be careful to dry, and not to cook or bake it while 
in the oven. When required for use, soak it over night in sweet 
milk. 

TOMATO SWEETMEATS. 

Scald and remove the skin, slice them thinly and stew them in 
sugar like other preserves, using the best kind of sugar, — three 
quarters of a pound, for a pound of tomatoes. 



JELLIES. HOW TO MAKE THEM. 



APPLE JELLY. 

Take one dozen of the largest apples, pare and slice them into 
three quarts and one pint of water. Put them into a tin pan, and 
boil them until they become a pulp and one half of the water is 
consumed. Pour it into a jelly-bag, and after it has done running, 
press what juice you can from the bag. To every pint of juice 
add one pound of white sugar ; set the juice and sugar on the fire 
and let them boil twenty minutes skimming it all the time. Add 
lemon juice and peel to taste. Pour it into tea-cups or jelly-glasses 
at hand, and turn it out entire. The above quantity of apples will 
make about three pints of juice. Remember, after you have 
pared one apple, slice it immediately into the water, and do not 
pare them all together ; moreover, let them lie, or it will render 
them red, and you will lose a great quantity of the apple juice. 
Golden pippin apples make the finest jelly. It is necessary to be 
very careful about over-boiling all fruit jellies, else they soon 
spoil ; fifteen to twenty minutes after the sugar has been added is 
generally sufficient. It is also important to put jellies and jams 
into the moulds or jars, the moment they are taken from the fire. 

Another method from the French is as follows : — Choose fine- 
flavored, jucy, ripe applies, peel them, and cut them into quarters, 
putting them into water as they are cut, to prevent their turning 
black. AVhen they are all cut, place them in the preserving-pan 
and put to them just water enough to cover them. Let them cook 
until they are quite soft ; take them out of the preserving-pan, 
place them in a seive, and let the juice drain from them. Boil the 
juice with an equal weight of sugar until it will jelly, (when test- 
ed by placing a little on a cold plate,) and pour it into the jelly 



JELLIES. 225 

jars. Quince jelly maybe made in the satiie manner. If it is 
desired to have the apple jelly of a full pink tinge, let a ittle 
cochineal be put into it, and that will give it color. 

MRS. Webster's wine jelly. 

Take of American isinglass four ounces ; dissolve it in three 
quarts of hot water ; add one half ounce of stick cinnamon, the 
juice of two, and the peel of one lemon, one and one half pounds 
of pure white sugar ; let it all come to a boil slowly, then add a 
gill of Maderia wine and let it simmer a while longer ; then strain 
it twice through a jelly bag, and set it to cool ; the extract of saf- 
fron colors it beautifully. 

* CRAB APPLE JELLY. 

Fill your preserving kettle with apples ; then cover with water. 
Boil until they are very soft. Drain the water off through a cloth, 
and add to each pint of the water, one pound of white sugar. 
Let the water come to a boil, before adding the sugar. Then boil 
five minutes. Turn off into glasses, or small jars, and when cold 
cover with thick paper. 

CIDER JELLY. 

Boil new cider to the consistency of syrup, adding a pound of 
white sugar to a gallon of cider. Skim it. Let it cool, and it will 
be a beautiful clear jelly, very nice to make drink for the sick or 
well. 

^' 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Fill a jar with currants, and place it in a kettle of boiling water. 
When the juice is expelled, strain through a cloth, and to every 
pint add a pound of white sugar. Boil ten minutes, skimming till 
it is quite clear. Black currant or grape jelly can be made in the 
same way. 

• QUINCE JELLY. 

If quinces are high a jelly may be made of the peels and cores, 
but if the fruit is plenty, boil the whole. Allow one quart of 
water to ten pounds of quince. Cover the fruit and boil until ten- 



226 JELLIES. 

der ; then pour them into a jelly bag without pressing, and let 
them drain into an earthen dish, no matter if until the next morn- 
ing. Allow a pound of the best white sugar for every pint of 
juice. Place the syrup on the fire in a preserving kettle ; as soon 
as it becomes hot, stir in the sugar, boil a few moments ; and put 
it in moulds. 

^ BLACKBERRY JELLY. 

Boil the berry a few moments, then strain it and add one pound 
of sugar to one quart of juice. Boil it till it becomes a jelly. 

WINE JELLY. 

To one pint of wine add one ounce of isinglass," half a pound of 
sugar, and spice to your taste. 

RICE JELLY. 

Take quarter of a pound of rice flour, and half a pound of loaf 
sugar, boil them in a quart of water ; when they become a glutin- 
ous mass strain oflf the jelly, add wine or lemon juice and let it 
cool. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Take four table-spoonsful of tapioca, rinse it thoroughly, then 
soak it five hours in cold water enough to cover it. Set a pint of 
cold water on the fire, when it boils, mash and stir up the tapioca 
that is in the water, and mix it with the boiling water. Let the 
whole simmer gently, with a stick of cinnamon or mace. When 
thick and clear, mix two table-spoonsful of white sugar with half 
a table-spoonful of lemon juice, and a glass of white wine — stir it 
into the jelly ; if not sweet enough, add more sugar, and turn the 
jelly into cups. 

JELLY FROM GELATLNE. 

To make two quarts, take a two ounce package of the gelatine 
and soak for one hour in a pint of cold water ; add to this o»e and 
one-half pounds of sugar, the juice of four lemons, some orange 
peel, stick cinnamon or other flavoring ; when the gelatine is thor- 
oughly soaked, pour on three pints of boiling water and strain im- 



JELLIES. 227 

mediately through a jelly bag or coarse toweling ; next pour into 
moulds and set aside to cool ; in warm weather use a little more 
gelatine. 

CRANBERRY JELLY. 

This is made like currant jelly, but it is hardly worth while to 
make it to keep, when it is so easily made fresh all through the 
winter. 

SAGO JELLY. 

A tea-cupful of sago, boiled in three pints and a half of water 
till ready. When cold, add half a pint of raspberry syrup. Pour 
it into a shape which has been rinsed in cold water, and let it stand 
until it is sufficiently set to turn out well. When dished, pour a 
little cream round it, if preferred. 

MEDLAR JELLY. 

Take medlars when they are ripe (i. e. when eatable) and put 
them into a preserving pan with as much water as will cover 
them ; simmer slowly until they become a pulp, then strain through . 
a thin jelly bag, and to every pint of juice add a qurrter of a 
pound lump sugar. Boil for an hour and pour into jars ; when 
cold it will be a stiff jelly. Medlar jelly made from this recipe, 
in some degree resembles Guava jelly. It makes a very good ad- 
dition to a winter dessert. 

calf's FEET JELLY. 

Take well cleaned calf's feet, put one quart of water to four calf's 
feet, and boil until reduced to one quart ; then strain, and when 
cold, take off the top. In taking out the jelly, avoid the settlings. 
To the quart, put half a pound of sugar, the juice of two lemons, 
and clarify this with the whites of two eggs, boil all together a few 
moments and strain it through a cloth. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Take garden grapes before they are fully ripe, pick them, and 
boil gently with a little water, or small cupful, until the piece flows 
freely, and the pulp is diissolvec^, Strain throgh a thin Swiss mus- 



228 JELLIES. 



lin bag, pressing the pulp through, and boil again for fifteen min- 
utes before adding the sugar, a pound of loaf sugar,. to every pint. 
Boil with the sugar fifteen minutes longer, taking off any skum that 
may rise. Put in moulds or glasses, and cover with egg paper. 
Wild grapes will make jelly, but not so firm as the cultivated ones. 



FRESH FRUITS. 



STRAWBERRIES AND CREAIH. 

Pick your strawberries over carefully ; if they are dusty, wash 
them, by pouring water over them through a colander. Arrange 
them in a glass dish, sprinkling a thick layer of powdered sugar 
over them when it is half full, and another on the top ; sugar them 
only a few minutes before they are to be eaten, and cover with 
cream or condensed milk, partially diluted, when serving. [See 
page 186, 187.] 

PEACHES. 

Peel fine juicy rareripe peaches, cut them up, cover thickly with 
powdered sugar, and serve with cream, or without. 

HUCKLEBERRIES. 

Some people like these without sugar, the best way therefore is 
to pick them carefully, and put them on the table in a glass dish, 
.flanked by a bowl of powdered sugar, and a pitcher of milk, and 
let every one suit his or her taste. They are delicious eaten in a 
bowl with bread and milk, and in this way, constitute an excellent 
summer morning, or mid-day meal. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

These are best without milk, and may be sugared either before 
or after putting on the table. Plenty of white powdered sugar is 
necessary, and a little lemon juice dropped upon the sugar is an 
improvement. 

WHITE AND RED CURRANTS. 

Pick them large, and fresh from the stems, and put them either 
together, or separate Into glass dishes ; cover then thickly with white 



230 FKESH FRUIT. 

pondered sugar an hour before they are wanted, and serve with 
sugar in a glass bowl. IMixed white and red currants make a very 
pretty dish, and with plenty of sugar are delicious to eat with 
custard. 

CURRANTS AND HUCKLEBERRIES. 

Red currants, and huckleberries mixed, make a delightful and 
refreshing dish, the sugar should be sprinkled through them half 
an hour before they are eaten, served with milk, or cream. An 
excellent breakfast dish ; the currants just imparting to the huckle- 
berries the piquant taste that they lack. 

CURRANTS AND RASPBERRIES. 

These are excellent mixed, and eaten in the same way, much 
finer to our taste than raspberries alone, although in the absence 
of currants, no one would object to raspberries, which are the 
most delicate of all fruit, and are served precisely like strawber- 



CHERRIES. 

These are less desirable than other small fruit, uncooJced, and are 
liable to be infected with worms. White hearts, fine and smooth, 
pitted, or only sprinkled whole, with powdered sugar, are however, 
very nice. 



YEAST, BREAD, BISCUITS, Etc. 



YEAST. 

Take twelve large potatoes, pare and grate them; have two 
single handsful of hops boiled in one quart of water ; strain upon 
the potatoes ; set the pan on the stove, and stir till it scalds ; take 
off, and add one table-spoonful of brown sugar, one tea-spoonful 
of ginger ; when cool, add half a pint of good brewer's yeast if it 
can be got, if not, take hop or cake yeast to start with, the flour 
will soon work out. This is always ready, does not sour quickly, 
and will keep two months in a cool place without needing soda. 
It should be put into a half gallon jug, corked, and tied down and 
kept in a cool place. One tea-cupful will raise two large loaves 
of bread. 

CONlSnECTICUT YEAST. 

Put a handful of hops in a bag, boil in two quarts of water with 
five pared potatoes ; when done, sift the potatoes, put with them 
in a pan one table-spoonful of flour, half cup of sugar, half cup of 
salt ; pour on this the boiling hop water. When sufficiently cool, 
add yeast enough to ferment it well, then put it in a jug, cork tight, 
keep in a cool place. 

AN EXCELLENT YE.i.ST. 

Boil four good sized potatoes, mash or sift fine, then add one 
half cup of sugar, two-thirds of a cup of salt, one quart of boil- 
ing water, then put in one pint of cold water and a cup of old 
yeast ; cover and rise over night ; it will then be fit to use ; one 
gill is sufficient for three pints of flour. 

POTATO YEAST. 

This does not keep long, but it is very nice to use for anything 
which requires raising. It is made by smoothly mashing a dozen 



232 YEAST, BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 

large, mealy, boiled potatoes, into which mix a large handful of 
white flour and a little salt. Stir in a tea-cup of baker's yeast to 
make it a batter. When it is raised up light, bottle and cork it 
tight and put it in a cool place. It may be used without any fear 
of making bread or biscuit bitter, as is sometimes the case with 
hop yeast. 

YEAST CAKES. 

Stir light fresh hop yeast into Indian meal until it becomes the 
consistency of dough. Make this into thin cakes, and dry on a 
board in the oven, or where there is sun, and a current of air. 
Turn twice a day, until thoroughly dried, and then put them in a 
bag and hang in a cool, dry place. They keep good a long time. 

BREAD .-^1. 

For about three loaves of bread, the night before baking, ,oake "t / 
a pint of sifted flour, put it into a pan, sprinkle on two tea-spoons- 
fuls of cold water ; then pour on it very gradually, stirring out the 
lumps carefully as the flour becomes wetted, a quart of boiling wa- 
ter. Let it stand and get nearly cold, and then add half a pint of 
potato yeast, mixing it in thoroughly. Let it stand in the room, 
not where it is too warm, over night, in the morning have ready 
sufficient sifted flour in the tray, then make a pint of thin corn- 
meal mush, clear and free from lumps, set it away till it cools, then 
pour it in a hole made in the middle of the flour. Pour in also the 
yeast batter instead of wetting, and mix the whole into dough. 
* Knead it and set it away to rise, being very careful to keep it an 
equal temperature the whole time. When light mold it into loaves ; 
let it stand ten or fifteen minutes in a warm place, then bake 
about an hour, or until done. It should not be underbaked, and it 
is just as Important that it should not be over-done. It is a com- 
mon error that over-done bread is healthy. If the crusts are thick 
and hard they can be moistened up, covering the loaf fresh from 
the oven with one or two thicknesses of damp cloth. Several 
thicknesses of wet cloth wrapped around it in this way render it 
indigestible. In making the batter over night, five or six middling 
sized potatoes, boiled to a mush, and pulped through a colander, 
may be added to it. 



TEAST, BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 233 



BREAD. — 2. 

An easier way of making bread, is to heat two bricks to one 
hundred degrees or more, and place the pan you make the bread in, 
on them. Put in the flour and salt ; make for three loaves, a pint 
of corn meal mush, free from lumps ; set it away to cool ; mix it 
in the flour with a tea-cup of potato yeast, and make the whole in- 
to dough with lukewarm water; the mixing and kneading all 
being done on the hot bricks. Have well-greased tins, divide the 
dough into them, set them to rise on the hot bricks by the stove, 
with a piece of carpet over the bricks to moderate the heat, and 
cover them well with woolens. Let it rise about two hours, then 
bake in a steady oven. 

GENER^O. RULES. 

Generally in making bread, one quart of wetting, either of milk 
or water, is sufficient for five quarts of flour or meal. Ten quarts 
of flour or meal will make four loaves of about three and a half 
pounds each, to be baked in quart pans. Water mixed with flour 
or meal should be about blood warm. When yeast is used, it 
should be well stirred and diluted with lukewarm water before 
being added to the flour. 

RYE AND INDIAN BREAD 

The proportions of rye and corn meal used, may be varied ac- 
cording to the taste. If the largest proportion of rye is used, 
make the dough stiff; if the largest proportion of corn meal, make 
the dough softer. The greater the proportion of corn meal, the 
longer the bread requires baking. The best way to mix the dough 
is to put the corn meal into a glazed earthen pan ; sprinkle salt over 
it, pour on boiling water, work it till thoroughly wet, and when 
about milk-warm add the rye flour with the yeast, and as much 
more warm, but not hot water, as is required. Work the dough 
until stiff, but not as stiff as flour dough. Put it then in a deep 
greased pan, put your hand in warm water and pat down the top, 
set it to rise in a warm place by the stove in winter, but in the sun. 
in summer. When it begins to crack on the top, which will be in 
an hour or an hour and a half, put in a well heated oven. To 



234 YEAST, BEEAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 

make the bread two thirds of corn meal, take four quarts of sifted 
corn meal, sprinkle a table-spoonful of salt over it, pour over it 
two quarts of boiling water, as directed above ; when lukewarm 
add two quarts of rye meal, lialf a pint of lively yeast mixed in a 
pint of warm water, — add more warm water if necessary. Bake 
two or three hours. This makes a loaf weighing seven or eight 
pounds. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Make a batter of Graham flour in the ordinary way, but mix it 
rather thin. Let it rise, divide the loaves into tins just as soon as 
it is light, for it becomes sour quicker than bolted flour ; bake aa 
hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half, according to the size of 
the loaf. A little molasses can be added to the batter if desired. 



One quart of rye flour, two quarts of Indian meal, one pint of 
Graham flour, all fresh, half a tea-cupful of molasses or brown su- 
gar, half a pint of potato yeast, and salt. Mix into as stiff a 
dough as can be stirred with a spoon, using warm water for wet- 
ting. Let it rise several hours or over night, then bake five or six 
hours. 

RICE FLOUR BREAD. — 1. 

Boil a pint of rice soft, add a pint of cream, then three quarts 
of rice flour; put it to rise in a tin or earthen vessel until it has 
risen sufficient ; divide it into three parts, and bake it as other 
bread, and you will have three large loaves ; or scald the flour, 
and when it is cold mix half wheat flour or corn. Raised with 
leaven in the usual way. 

RICE FLOUR BREAD. — 2. 

One quart of rice flour ; make it into a stiff pap by wetting with 
warm water, not so hot as to make it lumpy ; when well wet, add 
boiling hot water, as much as two or three quarts ; stir it contin- 
ually until it boils ; when it cools, put in half a pint of yeast and a 
little salt ; knead in as much wheat flour as will make it a proper 
dough for bread ; put it to rise, and when risen, add a little more 



YEAST, BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 235 

wheat flour. Let it stand in a warm place half an hour, and bake 
it. This same mixture, only made thinner, and baked in rings, 
makes excellent muffins. 

MOIST RICE BREAD. 

In three quarts of cold milk and water, mix a pint and a half 
of ground rice. It will be a thin gruel ; boil it three or four min- 
utes, and then stir in Graham flour until it is too stiff to stir with 
a spoon. Let it become lukewarm, add two gills of yeast and 
salt ; let it rise, and bake it an hour. 

APPLE BREAB 

Mix the pulp from a dozen good-flavored, boiled apples, with 
twice its quantity of wheat flour, or Graham flour; add salt, yeast, 
and bake as usual. 

PULLED BREAD. 

Take the crumb out of a hot loaf of bread, and divide it into 
rocky looking pieces, by pulling it to pieces quickly with the fin- 
gers of both hands ; place these pieces on a baking tin, lined with 
paper, and bake them over again to a light-brown color. Do them 
in a quick oven to ensure their being very crisp. 

PIECES OF BREAD. 

These need not be thrown away. Rich bread puddings may be 
made of them ; they may be made into crumb cakes, or dressing 
for any kind of meat that can be stuffed, is made of soflened crusts, 
butter, herbs, and a beaten egg. In the summer when bread becomes 
mouldy by keeping, the pieces that cannot be used immediately, can 
be dried on tins in the oven and used pounded for puddings, or 
crumb cakes, or to dress a ham, as cracker crumbs. Some have a 
small board on which to slice bread, and brush the crumbs from 
it into a box. It is easier to save them than to scatter them over 
the table or floor. 

SHORT CAKE. 

Put into a basin twelve ounces of flour, and six ounces of but 
tcr, or half the quantity if sufficient for your purpose; take off 



236 YEAST, BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 

little bits of butter with your fingers and rub thoroughly into th© 
flour; then moisten it with as little water as possible, only just 
enough to hold the paste together, as the less water used the short- 
er the crust will be. Roll out the paste upon a smooth board, of 
the desired thickness. This quantity is sufficient for the cover of 
two fruit tarts. While making pastry always endeavor to be in a 
cool place in summer, and a moderately warm one in winter ; use 
cold water in summer, and water a little warm in winter. 

RUSKS.

[3 as thin as it can be to hold together, then cut it out into shape 
of small round cakes. Make these firm by placing them over the 
fire on a griddle (a gridiron of fine wire bars) for a very short 
time, and afterwards toast them on each side alternately before

244 YEAST, BEEAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 



ECONOMICAL GRIDDLE CAKES. 

A capital and economical way of making griddle cakes, is to keep 
a stone jar or pitcher, into which put all the scraps, cold hominy, 
rice, mashed potato, small pieces of bread, in short everything 
eatable which is clean and good, and can be reduced to a pulp. 
Into the mixture also put any stray drops of milk that may be left, 
and when a pint, or more, or less, according to the size of the 
family, has accumulated, mix it with flour into a batter, sweeten 
with a tea-spoon of bi-carbonate of soda, or refined saleratus, and 
reduce still further if necessary, with a little sweet milk. These 
cakes will be found delicious, and can be made without any eggs,

As a change from griddle cakes, housekeepers will find a dish 
of boiled hominy, or farina, very palatable, and especially health- 
ful for children. Farina should be mixed thin, about like meal 
mush, and boiled as long, say an hour. Hominy should be soaked 
in cold water over ni^ht, and boiled for an hour, with a little salt, 
in the morning. It is eaten with sugar and milk, or butter and 
sugar. It is a reliable -breakfast dish the year round. 



246 YEAST, BREAD, BISCTJIT, ETC.

fectly smooth ; add a tea-spoon of salt, and thin off with butter-milk, 
into part of which a tea-spoon of soda has been dissolved ; when

and season sparingly with salt and nutmeg, and add if desired a 
very little new milk ; for a very sick person, the nutmeg and milk, 
and even the salt, may be omitted. Oat meal gruel may be made 
in the same way. 

MILK PORRIDGE.

OLD FASHIONED HULLED CORN. 

Shell a dozen years of ripe, dry corn, put it in an iron kettle 
and cover with cold water ; put in the corn a bag of two tea-cups- 
ful of fresh wood ashes, and boil until the corn looks yellow, and 
tastes strong of the alkali, then take out the bag and boil the corn 
in the lye over an hour, then pour off the lye, add fresh water, and 
simmer until the corn swells. If the hulls do not then come off 
by stirring, turn off the water and rub them off with a towel ; add 
more water and simmer for three or four hours, often stirring to 
keep it from burning ; when it swells out and becomes soft and 
white, add salt to liking and let all the water simmer away. Eat 
warm or cold with cream or milk. 



BREAKFAST. 



BREAKFAST. 



A great variety of dishes are unnecessary for breakfast, but see 
that what you do have, is nicely cooked, and properly served. Un- 
less sickness or some other circumstance prevents, the mistress of 
the house should always add the finishing touches to the breakfast 
room, and the breakfast table. The most experienced servant will 
fail in producing just the right degree of light and sunlight, in 
getting rid of the last speck of dust, or the latest evidence of ashes, 
and never thinks at all of transferring a branch of rosebuds, and 
geranium from the garden to the mantel piece ; these belong to the 
gentler thought, and more refined instincts of the cultivated lady, 
and such duties are not at all beneath the dignity of the highest in 
the land. 

That the dishes may be well-cooked, and well served, they must 
be adapted to the other services required on that day. On wash- 
ing and ironing days, for instance, as little time, and as little of the 
fire should be used as possible, and care should be taken to save 
interruption to the important, and principal business of the day. 

Broiled chicken, or warmed over chicken, and omeletts, are 
always nice breakfast dishes, but in cities the prices puts them out 
of the reach of ordinary people, except on extraordinary occasions. 
The regular dishes, such as beefsteak, mutton chops, fish, broiled 
ham, eggs, and warmed over potatoes, are all understood, and in 
the different kinds and degrees, constitute the daily breakfast proba- 
bly, of half the world. 

There is a very Important point however, to which little attention 
is paid, and that Is fruit. '* Fruit," salth the old proverb, " Is golden 
In the morning, silver at noon, and lead at night," yet it Is only at 
night, that In this country, we eat It at all, as part of a meal. This 
is wrong, fruit Is a most valuable part of food, it cannot be too 



BREAKFAST. 249 

highly estimated ; more fruit, with less saleratus, and rich greasy 
compounds, such as butter with meats, gravies, and the like, would 
take away the occupation of half the doctors, and reduce wonder- 
fully the sum total of dyspepsia and liver complaints. 

A distinguished physician has said that one or two tart Messina 
oranges eaten before breakfast during the three spring months, 
would cure the worst obstinate bilious disorder ; but the cure would 
undoubtedly be as eflfectual if they were eaten at breakfast, and the 
usual amount of pork and melted butter on hot cakes, reduced 
during that time. 

The rule should be to have fresh fruit on the table every morning, 
as long as it lasts, and then a preparation of dried, canned, or 
preserved fruits, a small investment in Guava jelly ; and that India 
fruit, for breakfast, will not be thrown away, after your own stock 
is exhausted, and you begin to tire of apples, and the common 
dried varieties. 

A very valuable adjunct to the breakfast table is the tomato ; 
highly prized as it is, its admirable medicinal qualities are only just 
beginning to be discovered. Providentially, it is so cheap, and 
grows so readily and profusely, that the poorest person can lux- 
uriate in its excellence, as well as the richest, and derive all the 
more benefit from not being able to destroy its virtue with butter, 
and an excess of condiments. 

Tomatoes are an almost soveriegn cure for dyspepsia, and should 
be on the table, raw or cooked, the year round. Persons habituated 
to them, soon learn to love them in any form, sliced with a little 
pepper, salt, and vinegar, stewed, baked, or even fresh from the 
vines ; the least healthful and generally the least palatable mode of 
serving them, is sweetened, or cooked with sugar. 

Mush, hominy, wheaten grits, or some dish of that sort, should 
be frequently seen upon the breakfast table, such food is excellent 
for children, and soon becomes very palatable, and highly esteem- 
ed by grown persons. Moreover if it is not eaten when first boil- 
ed, it is not wasted ; it is just as good fried, or used as a basis for 
griddle cakes. 

In some families, warm soda biscuit for breakfast, is the regular 
thing; this is very hurtful. Good home-made bread, not quite 
fresh, is best. French bread, baked the day before, next best ; 
11* 



250 BREAKFAST. 

good baker's twist, third best. For a change, warm com bread, 
or johnny cake may be made for breakfast, rice cakes, or waffles, 
and if biscuits, make them from the light dough mixed over night, 
shortened with a little butter. 

When the spring water-cresses come in, there should be thank- 
fulness. Pile them up fresh, green, and crisp, upon a dish in the 
centre of the table, and eat them with new laid eggs boiled soft, 
salt, nice Graham bread, and sweet butter. This is a breakfast 
suited to Lent, and fit for a Republican queen.

COFFEE, TEA, Etc. 



COFFEE. 

It is better to buy whole coffee and grind it yourself. Let the 
coffee pot be clean and free from the smell of stale coffee. Grind 
sufficient coffee fresh for use at one time, then stir it about with 
the white and shell of an egg, mixing them thoroughly. Or an egg 
may be mixed with half a pound of ground coffee, which is to be 
used as required, and the egg tends to preserve the aroma. Take 
a table-spoonful of coffee or less for each person, pour upon it as 
much boiling water as will be required, and boil it up as quickly 
as possible. Pour out a tea-cupful and put it back again, or pour 
the whole backwards and forwards several times. Take it from the 
fire and pour half a tea-cupful of quite cold water into it and let it 
stand five minutes by the fire ; but do not let it boil again, before 
you transfer it to the coffee pot in which it is to be served. Do not 
shake it in doing this, as the egg shell and coffee powder will have 
settled at the bottom, and the liquid ought to be perfectly clear. 
A little isinglass is sometimes used instead of egg. Many insist 
that it is quite unnecessary to use the egg at all. Loaf sugar and 
boiled milk should be served with it, allowing each person to suit 
their own taste. 

COFFEE CREAM. 

Some make coffee cream by boiling three cups of coffee after 
it is made, with a pint of cream and sugar to taste, until they are 
reduced nearly one half, and so serving it. 

DINNER COFFEE. 

Take pure Mocha coffee, one table-spoonful to each person, 
mix with egg and cold water, and boil perfectly clear. Serve 



254 COFFEE, TEA, ETC. 

without milk, but with loaf sugar, or if you choose with burnt 
brandy, and sugar, in very small cups. 

COLD COFFEE. 

Make a quart of good coffee, pour it oflf clear, and add to it a 
pint of new milk, a gill of cream, and enough loaf sugar to 
sweeten it. Set it back on the fire, and let it all come to a boil. 
This will be delicious cold, or it is good warmed up next day. 
Bottles of such coffee are sometimes useful to take on a picnic. 
Use the best lump, or coffee crushed sugar, for coffee, coarse brown 
spoils the flavor. 

CHOCOLATE {American). 

Procure the best chocolate, grate it, allowing two heaping table- 
spoonsful to a quart of mixed milk and water. Boil it fifteen 
minutes, taking off the scum as it rises, and serve with sugar and 
cream. 

CHOCOLATE (Frcncli) . 

Break the chocolate in pieces, boil it in a little water, stirring all 
the time, then add double the quantity of milk, and allow that to 
boil also, stirring, but not skimming, until it has boiled up thick 
for several minutes. Add loaf sugar to taste, and serve with cream, 
or new milk to thin it off, if preferred. 

COCOA. 

To make good cocoa from the nibs, it should be boiled for three 
or four hours, and strained when it is taken from the fire. Should 
any grease rise to the surface after this it must be removed either 
with writing paper, or by skimming. Sufficient quantity of cocoa 
may be made at one time to last three or four days, as it will re- 
main perfectly good for that time, and should be merely boiled up 
when wanted and served with hot milk. In boiling, use a quart of 
cold water to a quarter of a pound of cocoa nibs, or vary according 
to taste. 

TEA. 

** Tea," as a meal is a lost institution in most of our large cities. 



COFFEE, TEA, ETC. 255 

More's the pity, for It was the cosiest, and pleasantest meal of the 
day. Moreover, with it, has gone out early hours, and thrifty 
habits, attention to home duties, and love of home pleasures. The 
late breakfasts, which are the rule now, and the six o'clock dinners, 
not only destroy health, but give the day to gossiping and visiting, 
to shopping and the promenade, and aiford an excuse for daily ex- 
pensive lunches at fashionable restaurants, which make simple home 
fare distasteful. 

'* Tea," in the old-fashioned sense, is still to be met with occas- 
ionally in the country, and who that has ever assisted in a pleasant 
family circle at that most enjoyable of all meals, but remembers it 
with a longing to experience it once again. The cosy table, the 
light delicate food, the hot, fragrant beverage in small cups, han- 
dled tenderly, as if with a due appreciation of their contents ; the 
leisure which all enjoy after the principal business of the day is over, 
and the stimulus to lively and agreeable conversation, which the 
meal affords. 

But the tea itself must be good ; no luke warm infusion, no 
mere slop, by quantity of which you seek to make up for the qual- 
ity. One cup of really good, inspiring tea, is worth a gallon of 
the liquid which well-intentioned housewives sometimes pour out, 
with the assurance that it is not strong, and will not hurt you. The 
truth is, that the amount of liquid is a positive injury, while, what- 
ever of virtue the tea possessed, is drowned in it ; but there are 
persons who still insist upon their ancient right to three or four 
cups, and perhaps the less tea there is in these, the better. 

HOW TO MAKE TEA. 

Scald your tea-pot for six persons, put in three tea-spoonsful 
of best green tea, pour a little boiling water upon it, and set it to 
steep. Put four tea-spoonsful of best black tea in a tin cup with a 
cover, pour cold water upon it, cover it tight, and bring it to a quick 
boil ; let it boil a minute, and then add it to the green, which 
should only steep in boiling water, not boil. Fill up with the ne- 
cessary quantity of boiling water, and it is ready for the table. 

It is not known by many persons, that the Oolong and other 
black teas require boiling, in order to extract their strength and 
virtue. Those who mourn over poor, weak, modern tea, are ad- 
vised to try this method.

WINES AND DRINKS, 



CURRANT CHAMPAGNE. 

Ingredients for thirty gallons : —Three bushels, or one hundred 
and fifty pounds of currants, seventy-five pounds of white Havanna 
or refined crushed sugar; three pints white brandy, with suffi- 
cient pure soft water. The fruit should be gathered in dry 
weather, when ripe ; mash them to break every berry, but not 
bruise the stems ; add a portion of the water, and after stirrino- 
well, turn the mass on to a strainer, over a grain sieve, or riddle, 
rubbing and pressing very gently with the hands. The usual 
practice of squeezing and wringing through the strainer forces 
through too much pulp, occasioning too great a degree of fermen- 
tation. The sugar should be put into a tub or other open vessel, 
with the brandy, and the liquor strained on to it. When the su- 
gar is dissolved, strain the whole through a fine hair, or grass 
cloth, into a strong, sweet cask of thirty-two gallons, and fill up 
to within two gallons, which leaves sufficient room for the fermen- 
tation to proceed, and drive in the bung tight. It is desirable 
that all parts of the process should go on at the same time, and be 
finished with all possible dispatch. The sooner the wine is bottled 
after it is perfectly fine, the more briskness it will exhibit. In 
producing champagne, it is necessary to give air for a short time, 
to increase the fermentation and deprive it of a great portion of 
its sweetness. The white currant is sweeter, and pleasanter fla- 
vored, when ripe, for table use, than the red. The wine made 
from it is nearly colorless, of sweet and pleasant flavor. Bottled 
before the fermentation has entirely subsided, it makes a fine 
champagne. 

12 



266 WINES AND DRINKS. 



CURRANT WINE. 

Bruise ripe currants stripped from the stem, and add to every 
gallon of pulp, half a gallon of water, first boiled and cold ; let if 
remain in a tub twenty-four hours to ferment ; strain it through a 
hair sieve, not pressing it with the hand, but letting it take its 
time to run. Then stir well in two pounds and a half of white su- 
gar to every gallon of liquor. Add a quart of best rectified spirit 
of wine to every six gallons. After it has stood six weeks, bottle 
it. If it is not very fine empty it into other bottles, let it stand 
two weeks and then rack it off into smaller bottles. 

BLACK CURRANT WINE. 

Put the currants, after picking out the stems and leaves, into an 
open vessel, and cover them with water, keeping an account of the 
amount ; then with a pestle or pounder mash every berry ; let them 
stand for twenty-four hours to dissolve the pulp, then put the mass 
into a coarse bag and submit them to pressure, when the juice will 
run freely. After deducting the amount of water, the remainder 
will be the pure juice ; and now, to every gallon of the juice add 
two of water, including that first put in, and to every gallon of the 
mixture, add four pounds of crushed sugar. Put it into a cask, 
reserving sufficient to fill up while fermenting. Put the cask in a 
moderately cool dry room to ferment ; as the refuse works at the 
bung ; fill up with the liquor reserved. When it has ceased work- 
ing, bung it close for nine months, and it will be fit for botthng 
and use. This will have much of the flavor of Port wine, and 
make an excellent article for sacramental purposes. By reducing 
the quantity of sugar and adding water, it will be a fair imitation 
of claret wine, for a summer drink. 

GRAPE SYRUP. 

Pick the grapes from the stems, and to every four pounds of 
grapes, add a pint of water. Set them over a moderate fire till 
the grapes are well boiled, keeping the pan, which should be block 
tin or brass, covered ; strain through a hair sieve, gently pressing 
the grapes ; when cool, cover it with a plate and let it remain till 
the next day in either wood, or an earthen vessel. Then careful- 



WINES AND DRINKS. 267 

\y clear it off, and to each pint allow a pound of loaf sugar brok- 
en, put the sugar into a pan, adding a pint of water to every four 
pounds ; stir it while cold till the sugar is partly dissolved ; then 
put it on a moderately brisk fire with the pan covered, stirring it 
often till nearly boihng ; watch it carefully that it may not rise 
too much ; let it boil up several times, skim it off quite clean, 
then pour in the juice, cover the pan until it nearly boils ; remove 
the cover and let the syrup boil fifteen minutes, skimming it well. 
Pour the syrup into a stone jar, with a little grated lemon, or a 
few pieces of broken cinnamon, and let it remain one day. Then 
strain it into bottles, cork, and keep it in a cool place. This is 
recommended as an unalcoholic wine. 

GRAPE \VTNE. — 1. 

Crush five gallons of ripe grapes, and let them soak seven days 
in four and a half gallons of soft water ; add to it seventeen and 
a half pounds of white sugar. Strain it, put it into a clean cask, 
leave it open until fermentation ceases, then bung tightly. 

GRAPE WENE. — 2. 

Gather the grapes when they are just turning color, or about 
half ripe. Pound them in a tub with the stalks, and to every 
quart of pounded fruit, put two quarts of water. Let this stand 
in a mash tub fourteen days, then draw it off, and to every gallon 
of liquor put three pounds of loaf sugar ; when this is dissolved, 
cask the wine. After it has worked, bung it securely down, and 
keep it for six months ; then bottle it, and tie down or wire the 
corks, if it be intended to be kept more than one year. 

ELDER WINE. 

Take the juice of three gallons of elder berries, which will 
about equal six quarts. Add twenty-four pounds of sugar, and 
wash the husks of the berries, in sixteen quarts of water. Boil 
six ounces of ginger in water, strain and boil a second time. Add 
this and the juice of the berries, to the water in which the husks 
have been washed. Cask it, and when the fermentation is over, 
put into the cask some well-dried spices. 



268 WINES AND DKINKS. 



ELDER FLOWER WINE. 



Allow a gallon of water, and three pounds of sugar to every 
quart of the blossoms stripped from the stalks, boil and skim the 
sugar and water, and pour it over the flowers boiling hot. To 
every gallon of the liquor add a small table-spoonful of home- 
brewed hop yeast, and the juice of a lemon ; stir it thoroughly to- 
gether. Let the whole ferment for three days in an open vessel 
of wood or earthen, the top entirely covered with a thick woolen 
blanket. At the end of three days, strain it through a sieve and 
whisk the white of an eg^ beaten to a froth, through the wine. 
Put at the bottom of the cask chopped raisins, in the proportion 
of three or four pounds to every six gallons of wine, pour in the 
wine, and close the bung. In six months it will be fit to bottle. 

KLACKBERRY WINE. 

First pour boiling water on the fruit and when cool, bruise it. 
Let it stand until the berries rise to the top ; then drain off the 
clear liquor, measure it and add two pounds of sugar to every 
gallon of liquor ; stir it well and let it stand open a week or ten 
days, then draw off the wine and pan it through a jelly-bag. Take 
half an ounce of isinglass for every three gallons, dissolve it in a 
little of the wine and mix it through the whole. 

RHUBARB WINE. 

Chop the stalks, and for fifty pounds of rhubarb, allow thirty 
pounds of sugar ; press the juice, add the sugar and enough water 
for nine gallons of wine ; put it into a cask, cover it with a cloth 
until it ceases to ferment ; plug the barrel for three months, then 
bottle the wine, or if this is not convenient draw it off into a clean 
cask that it will fill completely. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE. 

Take a quantity of ripe, white or yellow gooseberries, bruise 
them with a pestle in a tub, and to every eight pounds of fruit add one 
gallon of cold spring water. Stir them and let them stand twenty- 
four hours ; then strain the mash through a fine sieve or a grass 
cloth strainer. To every gallon of juice add four pounds of white 



WINES AND DRINKS. 269 

loaf sugar. When all is dissolved, stir it well, and when settled put 
it into a cask with two quarts of brandy to every ten gallons of juice 
and half an ounce of isinglass. Set the cask in a cool place, leav- 
ing out the bung until the fermentation has nearly ceased. Then 
draw off into bottles, and cork tight immediately. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRY WINE. 

Having thoroughly bruised eight gallons of green gooseberries, 
put thera into eight gallons of cold water, and allow them to stand 
for twenty-four hours ; at the end of that time drain the liquor 
well off through a sieve, and for each gallon add three pounds and 
a half of loaf sugar; pour the liquor into a cask and put to it one 
quart of the best gin. After standing for six months it will be 
ready for bottling. 

GINGER WINE. 

To every gallon of water put nearly three pounds of loaf sugar, 
two lemons, and two ounces of ginger, bruised. Boil the sugar 
and water for half an hour, skimming it, then pour it on the rinds 
of the lemons and the ginger. When the liquor is milk warm, 
squeeze in the juice of the lemons, and put in it a little j'east at 
the same time. Let it work for two or three days, then put it in- 
to a cask closely stopped for six weeks. Bottle it with one gallon 
of brandy to twelve gallons of wine. The pulp of the ginger and 
lemons must be put into the cask with a little isinglass, to refine the 
wine ; but the pips and white part of the lemons should be remov- 
ed, as they make it bitter. 

BLACKBERRY BRANDY. 

Bottle equal quantities of blackberry juice and brandy, allowing 
a pound of loaf sugar to every gallon. Or, a gallon of black- 
berries can be put to each gallon of deodorized pure spirits, and 
the berries dissolved in the spirits. These are very good for bowel 
complaints. 

CHERRY BRANDY. 

Crush cherries, and allow one quart to every gallon of spirits. 
Wild cherries are the proper ones to be used. Rum, brandy, or 
deodorized pure spirits can be used.

RASPBERRY SYRUP. 



Add one quart of vinegar to three quarts of berries, let it stand 
one day then squeeze it through a cloth. Add a pound of sugar 
for each pint of juice and boil it twenty minutes.* 

HOP BEER. 

To make fifteen gallons, take twelve ounces of hops, six quarts 
of molasses, ten eggs. Put the hops in a bag, and boil them fifteen 
minutes in three pails-full of water. Put in the molasses while hot, 
and pour immediately into a strong ale cask which can be made 
perfectly air tight, and put in the remainder of the water cold. Let 
the mixture stand until cool, and then add the egg. This beer will 
not ferment in cold weather unless put in quite a warm place. It 
will keep six or eight months. Three months after it is fermented 
it is almost equal to ale. 

GINGER BEER 

Stir up in a gallon of boiling water, one pound of loaf sugar, one 
ounce and a half of the best ginger bruised, and one ounce of 
cream of tartar, or, if preferred, a lemon sliced, until the heat falls 
to that of new milk. Then having poured one table-spoonful of 
good yeast upon a piece of bread, put it in the middle of the vessel 
letting It float in the mixture. Cover the whole with a cloth, and 
let it stand twenty-four hours, after which, strain it and put it into 
bottles, filling each only about three parts full, cork them tightly, 
and tie them down. In warm weather this ginger beer will be 
ready to drink in two days. 

TO MAKE A CASK OF GINGER BEER. 

Take ten gallons of soft water, and fifteen pounds of loaf sugar, 
clarified with the whites of six eggs ; bruise half pound of white 
ginger ; boil half an hour. Pare off the thin yellow rind of twelve 
lemons, and pour the liquor when it is boiling, over the lemon 
peel. As soon as it is cool, mix a gill of good yeast with it, and 
put it in a cask. Retain two quarts of the liquor, in which dissolve 
two ounces of shred isinglass ; mix it with the wine, and shake 
well. Let the cask stand open all night ; then close the bung, 



WINES AND DEINKS. 271 

and In three weeks bottle it oflf. It will be fit to drink in throe 
months. 

SPRUCE BEER. — 1. 

Water ten gallons ; sugar ten pounds ; essence of spruce quar- 
ter of a pound ; yeast half pint. Dissolve the sugar and essence 
of spruce in the water, previously warmed ; then allow it to cool 
a little, and add the yeast as in making ginger beer ; iDottle imme- 
diately in half pint bottles. 

SPRUCE BEER. — 2. 

To a gallon of water, allow an ounce of hops and a spoonful of 
ginger. Boil it well, strain it, and add a pint of molasses and half 
an ounce of the essence of spruce ; let it cool, pour in a tea-cup of 
yeast and put it into a clean cask. After it has fermented a day or 
two, bottle it. 

ME.VD. 

To six gallons of water, add six quarts of strained honey, the 
yellow rind of two large lemons, pared very thin, and the whites 
of three eggs beat to strong froth. Mix and boil all together 
three quarters of an hour, skimming it well. Pour into a tub. 
When lukewarm, add three table-spoonsful of good fresh yeast, 
cover and leave it to ferment. When it is well worked, pour it 
into a barrel with lemon peel in the bottom, and let it stand six 
months. It will then be ready to bottle.

272 WINES AND DRINKS. 



GINGER POP. 



Take three quarters of a pound of white sugar, one ounce of 
cream of tartar, the juice and rind of a lemon, one ounce of gin- 
ger, put the whole into a pan, and pour over it four quarts of boil- 
ing water ; let it stand till lukewarm, and then add a table-spoon- 
ful of yeast. When it has ceased boiling, bottle it off in small 
soda water bottles or jars. It will be fit for use in twenty-four 
hours. 

IMPERIAL. 

Put into a jug that will contain three pints, half an ounce of 
cream of tartar, the juice of a lemon and the rind pared very thin ; 
pour boihng water over these, and add sugar to taste. When 
cold, it is fit for use. It is refreshing and wholesome for persons 
heated from the weather, or feverish from indisposition. 

BERRY DRINK. 

Put two quarts of ripe, fresh raspberries into a stone or glazed 
vessel, whose glazing will not be affected by acids, and pour on 
them a quart of good vinegar. Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
and then strain out the juice and vinegar. To each pint of this, 
add a pound of pulverized white sugar, and put it into a porcelain 
kettle to boil smartly for about half an hour, removing all the scum 
as it rises. When cold, bottle and seal. Half a gill of this, stir- 
red in a tumblerful of cold water, makes a delicious drink. Straw- 
berries, dewberries, or blackberries can be used in the same man- 
ner, only using just as much vinegar as will cover the fruit. Add 
no alcohol. With bottles well sealed, it will keep two years. 

YANKEE CORN DRINK. 

To five gallons of cold water, add one quart of sound com, and 
two quarts of molasses. Put it into a keg, shake well, and in two 
or three days it will be fit for use. Bung tight. It may be fla- 
vored with essence of spruce or lemon. The corn will last to make 
five or six brewings ; if it becomes sour, add more molasses and 
water. It is a cheap and simple beer, and is called very good. 

A QUICK DRINK. 

Take a glass of sherry, a small bit of mint, and some sugar to 



WINES AND DRINKS. 273 

taste ; mix together in a large tumbler, add some pounded ice, 
and then pour on it a pint of cider ; drink it when it eflfervesces. 
Half the quantity will generally be found enough, or the ingredients 
may be divided into two glasses, unless you have a soda water 
glass. 

MILK LEMONADE. 

Put one quart of boiling water, the juice of six fine lemons, the 
peel of three, pared very thin, two wine glasses of syrup, and half 
a pint of Maderia or Sherry into a covered vessel and let it stand 
twelve hours. Then boil half a pint of new milk, pour it on the 
mixture, and run it through a jelly bag until clear. It makes a 
refreshing drink. 

PORTABLE LEMONADE. 

Mix strained lemon juice to loaf sugar, in the proportion of 
four large lemons to a pound of white sugar, or as much as it will 
hold in solution. Grate the rinds, which add to this. Preserve in 
a close jar, or large mouthed bottles. Use a table-spoonful for a 
tumbler of water. 

FOURTH OF JULY SHERRY COBBLER. 

A large tumbler two thirds full of pounded ice ; half a dozen 
strawberries, a few fine chips from the yellow rind of a lemon, a 
table-spoonful of powdered sugar; fill with fine Sherry, shake, 
and take in the usual way. 

EGG NOG. 

To the yolks of six eggs, add six table-spoonsful of powdered 
sugar, a quart of new milk, half a pint of French brandy, and a 
pint of Maderia. Beat the whites up separately, and stir them 
through the mixture, just before pouring into cup glasses. 

STATEN ISLAND LEMONADE. 

Take half a dozen fresh lemons, and half a dozen smooth Se- 
ville oranges, and rub loaf sugar on the outside, until the flavor- 
ing oil is all extracted from the rind ; roll them soft, press out the 
juice, add the sugar to the juice, strain off the seeds, a bowl of

274 WINES AND DEINKS. 

pounded ice, a pint of Sherry, and a quart of water. Shake all 
together very thoroughly. It is a delicious summer drink. 

CLARET PUNCH. 

A pint bottle of claret, a gill of French brandy, four table- 
spoonsful of powdered sugar, the juice and thinly cut rind of a 
lemon, a lump of ice, and a pint of water. 

A COOL CUP. 

"Weigh six ounces of sugar in lumps, and extract the essence 
from the rind of a large, fresh lemon by rubbing them upon it, 
then put them into a deep jug, and add the strained juice of one 
lemon and a half. When the sugar is dissolved, pour in a bottle 
of good cider, and three large wine-glasses full of Sherry ; add 
nearly half a small nutmeg, lightly grated, and serve the cup with, 
or without some sprigs of fresh balm or borage in it. If closely 
covered down, and placed on ice for a short time, it will be more 
agreeable as a summer beverage. 

MAY DRLNK. (^German.') 

Put into a large, deep jug one pint of light white wine, to two 
of red, and dissolve in it sufficient sugar to sweeten it agreeably. 
"Wipe a sound China orange, cut it in rather thick slices without 
paring it, and add it to the wine ; then throw in some small bunches 
of the fragrant little plant, called woodruff, cover the jar close- 
ly to exclude the air, and leave it until the following day. Lemon 
rind can be used instead of oranges. Serve this to May-day 
visitors. 

OXFORD SWIG 

Put into a bowl a pound of sugar, pour on it a pint of warm 
beer, grated nutmeg, and some ginger, also grated; add four 
glasses of sherry and five pints of beer, stir it well, and if not 
sweet enough, add more sugar, and let it stand covered up four 
hours, and it is fit for use. Sometimes add a few lumps of sugar 
rubbed on a lemon to extract the flavor, and some lemon juice. If 
the lemon rind is pared very thin, without any of the white skin 
left, it answers better, by giving a stronger flavor of the lemon. 



WINES AND DRINKS. 275 

Bottle this mixture, and in a few days it will be in a state of effer- 
vescence. When served in a bowlfresh made, add some bread 
toasted very crisp, cut in narrow strips. 

SACK POSSET. 

Four ounces of fine brown sugar, a pint of sweet wine or sack, 
and a nutmeg ; let them simmer till the sugar is dissolved ; beat 
ten eggs, and put them on the fire to warm with a quart of milk, 
stir them one way to prevent curdling ; when cold mix all together 
aud put it on the fire to warm, but not boil ; serve hot. 

CHRISTMAS EGG NOG. 

Take the yolks of eight eggs and six table-spoonsful of pulver- 
ized sugar, and beat them to the consistency of cream ; to this 
add half a nutmeg, grated, and beat well together, then mix one 
third of a pint of good Jamaica rum, and a wine glass of brandy 
or Madeira wine ; have ready the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth, and beat them into the above mixture ; when this is 
done, stir in three pints of good rich milk. No heat is used. 

MILK PUNCH. 

Beat up two eggs, well mix them with a quart of milk, adding 
sugar, nutmeg, and lemon peel, to taste. Boil this gentl}^ and 
stir it all the time until sufficiently thick. Remove it from the fire 
for a very few minutes, then add to it a full gill of rum, stirring it 
all the time it is being poured in. 

MILK PUNCH TO KEEP. 

Pare six oranges and six lemons, as thin as possible, and grate 
them afterwards to extract the flavor. Soak the peel for twenty- 
four hours in a bottle of rum or brandy, closely stopped. Squeeze 
the fruit on two pounds of sugar, and add to it lour quarts of wa- 
ter and one of new milk, boiling hot. Stir in the rum, and run it 
through a jelly bag until quite clear, then bottle and cork it closely 
immediately. 

COLD PUNCH. 

Put into a saucepan a full pint of cold water and one pound and

a half of white sugar ; let it be on the fire until the sugar is dis- 
solved. Add three bottles of white wine, some lemon syrup, and 
a little ginger, let it get hot, but not boiling. When quite hot, 
pour half a bottle of fine rum into it and immediately take it off 
the fire. As soon as the punch begins to cool, it must be bottled 
and well corked. It will keep good for some time. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 



KEEPmG GRAPES. 

Pick the grapes before they are dead-ripe and when perfectly 
dry ; remove all the defective ones ; wrap each bunch well in old 
paper or cotton, and not allow more than two layers in a box ; 
place in a cold, dry room where they will not freeze. 

The French preserve grapes the year round, by coating the clus- 
ters with lime. The bunches are picked just before they are thor- 
oughly ripe, and dipped in lime water of the consistency of thick 
cream. They are then hung up to remain. The lime coating 
keeps out the air, and checks any tendency to decay. When want- 
ted for the table, dip the clusters into warm water to remove the 
lime. 

In preserving grapes, with cotton, they are sometimes placed 
gently between layers of cotton in a glass or earthen ware jar. 
The jar is then corked down and the corks dipped in melted resin, 
or otherwise rendered air tight. 

KEEPING APPLES. * 

Apples, potatoes, etc., are well preserved in barrels and boxes 
in a dry cellar, with light and air excluded, and the temperature 
quite cold without freezing. Apples are sometimes kept excellent- 
ly in river sand dried in an oven, placing in a large box a layer of 
sand and a layer of apples, taking care that the apples do not touch 
each other. 

KEEPING PEAS FOR WINTER USE. 

Shell the peas, throw them into boiling water with a little salt in 
it, allow them to boil five or six minutes. Then drain in a colan- 
_dar,ajDul .afterwards on a cloth until completely dried. Then place 



278 MISCELLANEOUS. 

them in air tight bottles. Some place them into wide mouthed 
bottles, not quite filling them, and pour in fried mutton fat so as to 
cover them. Then cork tightly, securing the cork with resin or 
with a bladder. When used boil them until tender with some but- 
ter and a very little mint. Another method is after they are dried 
as above, place them on a tin or earthen dish in a mild oven once 
or twice until they harden, and then place them in paper bags hung 
in the kitchen. 

KEEPING CABBAGES. 

When the weather becomes frosty, cut them off near the head, 
and carry them with the leaves on, to a dry cellar. Break off su- 
perfluous leaves, and pick into a light cask or box, stems upward, 
and when nearly full, cover with leaves. Secure the box or barrel 
with a lid against rats. 

KEEPING CABBAGES IN THE COUNTRY. 

Take up the cabbages by the roots, set them closely together in 
rows up to the head in soil, roots down, the same as. it grows ; 
drive in posts at the corners of the bed, and intermediate spaces, 
if necessary, higher on one side than the other ; nail strips of board 
or lath on'these posts ; lay upon these old boards, doors, or if you 
have nothing else, bean poles and corn fodder, so that the roof 
will be clear of the cabbages, and allow the air to circulate ; close 
up the sides with yard or garden offal of any kind, and the cab- 
bages will keep all winter, fresh and green, and be accessible at 
all times, or nearly so, the frost not being so severe under this 
protection as in exposed places. Exclude moisture, but never 
mind the frost. 

KEEPING MUSTARD. 

Dissolve three ounces of salt in a quart of boiling water, and 
pour it hot upon two ounces of scraped horseradish. Closely cover 
the jar, and let it it stand twenty-four hours, strain it, and by de- 
grees mix it with flour of mustard. Beat them well together for a 
long time, until the mixture becomes of the proper thickness. 
Put it into wide-mouthed bottles, and cork it down closely, when it 
will keep good for many months. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 279 



TO PRESERVE PAINT. 

Wash white paint with warm water, soap, a soft flannel ; do not 
scrub it with a brush, and wipe it dry with a large, old linen cloth. 
This will keep it nice for years. 

TO KEEP LEMONS. 

Keep them in cold water, changed every week. This also adds 
to the juice. 

TO PRESERVE PARSLEY FRESH AND GREEN. 

Put it into a strong pickle of salt and water, boiling hot, and 
keep for use. Or it is good for soup, stuffing, etc., hung up in 
bunches, in a dry attic or store-room. 

TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS 

Put your mushrooms, cut as for stewing, into a saucepan ; stew 
till all the liquor is drawn, and then till all again is absorbed ; and 
when quite dry, put in a good lump of butter, cayenne pepper, and 
salt. After it has boiled, pour into sweet-meat pots the sizes that 
will be sufficient for a dish, and well cover them with butter ; and 
they will be, when warmed up and well finished oiF with a little 
white sauce, as good as when fresh gathered. 

TO KEEP MEAT, GAME, OR POULTRY, IN HOT WEATHER. 

If you wish to keep meat a day or two longer, and there is danger 
of its being effiicted by the hot weather, sprinkle roughly pounded 
charcoal over it, and put the same under it ; for birds, put a lump 
of charcoal in the inside, and sprinkle the breast, and under the 
wings, with the pounded charcoal. 

TO REMOVE TAINT FROM MEAT OR POULTRY. 

Wash the part affected, with chloride of soda first, and then in 
fresh water. It should be cooked as soon as possible after being 
wet. Broiling, or i-oasting, is the best way to cook meats that 
have been kept a little too long. If salted, wash it and throw away 
the brine, then leave it, for a few days in the following composition ; 
Fresh burnt charcoal powdered, twelve parts ; common salt eleven 



280 MISCELLANEOUS. 

parts, saltpetre four parts. Mix and use the same as common salt. 
Before cooking remove the black color with clear water. 

SNOW AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EGGS. 

In making pancakes or puddings, snow is an excellent substitute 
for eggs ; two table-spoonsful of snow stirred in quickly are equal 
to an egg in puddings or pancakes for making them light. It is 
explained by the fact that snow contains in its flakes much atmos- 
pheric air, which is set free as it melts. 

CORN STARCH INSTEAD OF EGGS. 

For most cakes and puddings, for which eggs are used, a table- 
spoonful of corn starch or maizena will be found an excellent sub- 
stitute for one egg. 

EGG PAPER. 

Soft, tough paper cut to fit jars, and dipped in a saucer of white of 
egg, put over steamed jars of fruit or preserves, will keep them bet- 
ter than all the late inventions. "When the jars and fruit are scalded 
hot as possible, it will keep them nicely. For jellies and all kinds 
of pickles, it makes a cheap, convenient cover. The paper must 
turn over the rim of the jar. 

FROZEN POTATOES. 

Frozen potatoes give more starch or flour than fresh ones. 

SIZE OF TURNIPS. 

Small sized turnips have double the nutritious matter that larger 
ones have, but the largest ruta bagas are the most nutritious. 

TO "WASH FRUIT STAINS FROM THE HANDS. 

Rub them with sorrel, rhubarb stalks, lemon, apple or tomato 
skins. 

DAMP WOOLEN CLOTHING. 

Before putting damp woolen clothing to the fire, rub it with a 
moist sponge, the way of the nap, until the smoothness is restored ; 
brushing will not remove the roughness, unless this precaution is 
taken. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 281 



DLiMOND CEMENT. 

This Is the best cement for broken glass, or china, because it is 
colorless, and perfectly resists moisture. It requires to be liqui- 
fied by placing the vial in boiling water, and should then be ap- 
plied with a camel's hair brush. 

HOW TO PREVENT THE INROADS OF VERMIN. 

On entering a new house, have it thoroughly clean, and every hole 
and crevice, in cupboard, closet, or room, stopped up with a cement 
made of putty, and chloride of lime. Before putting carpets, or 
oil-cloth down, dust the edges of the boards with Lyons' or Per- 
sian powder, which will prevent the attacks of moths, and cock- 
roaches. A dollar spent in this way, will be found an excellent 
investment. Repeat the process, when general cleaning time 
comes, and with ordinary precaution in cleaning bedsteads, and 
taking care of furs, you will never be troubled with bugs, moths, 
or cockroaches. 

lobster's EGGS. 

Lobster's eggs boiled, and pounded in a mortar, constitute a per- 
fectly safe, harmless, and beautiful rouge. 

to strengthen the hair. 

Dilute an ounce of borax, and an ounce of camphor In two 
quarts of water, and wash the hair thoroughly twice a week, clip- 
ping the ends occasionally. It will quickly grow long, thick, and 
even. 

to clear, and STRENGTHEN THE VOICE. 

The best method Is In vogue among all distinguished vocalists, 
viz : swallow the yolk of a raw egg, tohole, every morning on ris- 
ing ; also avoid pastry, and sponge the throat and chest well with 
cold water daily. 

BUTTER COOLER. 

A simple mode of keeping butter in warm weather, where ice Is 
not handy, is, to pour about a pint of water, in a round dish, and 



282 MISCELLANEOUS. 

place half a brick, or stone the size of half a brick, in the water, 
and put the plate of butter upon it, then invert a common flower 
pot over the butter, so that the pot will set down in the water. 
The porousness of the earthen ware will keep the butter cool. 
It will be better still if the pot be covered with a wet cloth, the 
rapid abstraction of heat by external evaporation causing the but- 
ter to become hard. 

KITCHEN ODORS. 

Odors from boiling ham, cabbage, etc., may be prevented by 
throwing red pepper pods, or a few pieces of charcoal into the pot. 

FRUIT SINKING. 

To prevent fruit from sinking in puddings or cake, roll it in flour 
before putting it in. 

COCHINEAL. 

In using cochineal to give color, they may be broken and tied up 
in fine muslin, which obviates the difficulty of getting them out 
when the color is given. 

IMPROVING CORN MEAL. 

Indian meal is improved by being kiln dried. It may be spread 
on a dripping pan and heated in the oven. 

TO MAKE HENS LAY IN WINTER. 

Keep them warm, keep corn by them constantly, but do not feed 
it to them ; feed them with meat scraps, where lard or tallow has 
been tried, or fresh meat. Some chop up green peppers finely, 
and feed them. Let them have a frequent taste of green food, a 
little gravel and lime, or clam shells. 

TO FATTEN TURKEYS 

Eveiy morning for a month, give them mashed potatoes mixed 
with buckwheat flour, barley or beans ; take away what remains 
in the evening. After a month, add half a dozen balls made of 
barley flour, when they go to roost. Give them these eight days 
successively ; turkeys thus fed are fat and good. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 283 



HATCHING. 

Chickens are hatched in twenty-one days ; turkeys, twenty-six ; 
clucks and geese, thirty ; pigeons, eighteen. 

TO CLARIFY DRIPPING. 

Place the dripping in a large pan, pour on about a quart of boil- 
ing water, and pass the whole through a muslin or a sieve. Let it 
get cold, and the dripping can be taken out in a cake ; the refuse 
being at the bottom, will be easily scraped off. If it be not suffi- 
ciently clarified, the process must be repeated. 

TO CLARIFY MOLASSES. 

Common molasses may be clarified and rendered much more 
palatable by heating it over the fire and pouring in sweet milk, in 
the proportion of one pint to a gallon of molasses. When the 
molasses boils up once, the albumen in the milk collects all the im- 
purities in a thick scum upon the top, which must be carefully re- 
moved, and the molasses is then fit for use. Bullock's blood is 
also used for this purpose, but milk is more agreeable in many 
ways for domestic use. 

HOME MADE BREAD. 

The quantity of bread is greatly increased by using bran water 
for mixing the dough. A quart of bran should be boiled for an 
hour in water, and then strained through a sieve. 

IVORY HANDLES. 

Ivory handles should not be wet in washing. It is hard to re- 
move stains from ivory, without, at the same time, removing the 
polish. Muriatic acid removes the polish. If the stain arises from 
ordinary wear, it may be soaked in strong lime water, and after- 
wards exposed to the air, repeating the operation until it becomes 
white. It should not be exposed to the sun, or it will crack. A 
solution of muriatic acid will remove ink stains ; to restore the 
polish, rub with fine putty powder, or gilder's whiting till the pol- 
ish returns. Another method to remove stains from ivory handles 
is to take alum water, boil it and let it grow cold. Then soak the 



284 MISCELLANEOUS. 

handles in it for an hour, take them out and brush them well with 
a tooth brush. Dip a clean towel in pure water, squeeze it out and 
while wet wrap it around the handles, soaked and brushed as above, 
and leave all to dry gradually. If dried too rapidly out of the 
alum water, the handles will be injured ; if dried slowly, they will 
become white. 

TO FASTEN KNIFE HANDLES. 

Handles of knives or forks that have come off by being put in 
hot water, by mixing powdered resin with chopped hair or tow, 
chalk, whiting, or quick lime ; partly fill the hole with it, heat the 
spike of the knife or fork and force it in. Melted resin or brick 
dust, mixed, is also used. Or put a small portion of a quill pen 
into the handle, heat the blade, put it in the quill in the handle, 
and press it in firmly. 

TO TAKE OFF STARCH OR RUST FROM FLAT IRONS. 

Tie a piece of yellow beeswax in a rag, and when the iron is 
nearly hot enough to use, rub it quickly with the wax and then 
with a coarse cloth. 

RUST ON STEEL IMPLEMENTS, OR KNIVES. 

Cover the steel with sweet oil, well rubbing it on. Let it remain 
for forty-eight hours and then, using unslacked lime finely powder- 
ed, rub the steel until all the rust has disappeared. 

ROUGH FLAT IRONS. 

Rub them with fine salt, and it will make them smooth. 

CRACKS IN STOVES. 

Ashes and common salt wet and mixed, will stop the cracks in a 
stove and prevent smoke escaping. 

CEMENT FOR METAL AND GLASS. 

The following cement will firmly attach any metalic substance to 
glass or porcelain. Mix two ounces of a thick solution. of glue 
with one ounce of linseed oil varnish, or three fourths of an ounce 
of Venice turpentine. Boil them together, stirring them until they 



MISCELLANEOUS. 285 

mix as thoroughly as possible. The pieces cemented should be 
tied together for two or three days and nights. 



POLISHING PASTE. 



Cut half a pound of mottled soap into pieces, mix with half a 
pound of rotten stone in powder ; put them into a saucepan with 
sufficient cold water to cover the mixture, — about three pints ; boil 
slowly till dissolved to a paste. 

VARNITH TO PREVENT RUST. 

Make a composition of fat, oil and varnish, mixed with four 
fifths of highly rectified spirits of turpentine. Put this varnish on 
metal with a sponge. 

TO PRESERVE LAMP CHI^MNEYS FROM BRE AIDING. 

Place a cloth at the bottom of a large pan, fill the pan with cold 
water, and place the glass into it. Cover the pan and let its con- 
tents boil one hour. Take it off the fire and leave the glass in the 
water until it is cold. 

SOFT SOAP. 

Slice up four pounds of white bar soap into four gallons of wa- 
ter, and add a pound of sal soda. Mix, dissolve it thoroughly 
over the fire, and set aside for use. A smaller quantity can be 
made in the same proportions. 

CREAKING HINGES. 

Rub the hinges with a very little soft; soap. 

ICE ON WINDOWS. 

Windows may be kept free from ice, and polished, by rubbing 
the glass with alcohol, with a brush or sponge. 

WATER AND FIRE PROOF CEAIENT. 

A cement which is a good protection against weather, water and 
fire to a certain extent, is made by mixing a gallon of water with 
two gallons of brine, in two and a half pounds of brown sugar, and 
three pounds of common salt. Put it on with a brush, like paint. 
A smaller quantity can be made in the same proportions. 



286 MISCELLANEOUS. 



RAYS OF THE SUN. 

The rays of the sun may be kept from penetrating a window, by 
applying to it an ounce of powdered gum tragacanth in the whites 
of six eggs, well beaten. 

FIRE PROOF CEIMENT. 

Two pounds of brown sugar, three pounds of fine salt, one 
pound of alum ; mix thoroughly, put on like white-wash, on roofs 
of houses, fences, around fire-places, etc. 

WATER PROOF PASTE. 

Mix oil or lard with fine pieces of India rubber, simmer over 
a slow fire until thick as paste. 

FIRE IN THE CHEMNEY. 

Salt put on the fire in the grate below, acts chemically on the 
flaming soot above, and will often extinguish the fire in a short 
time ; or shoot a gun loaded with powder, up the chimney. 

TO DRIVE NAILS. 

Common cut nails, or screws, are easily driven into hard wood, 
if rubbed with a little soap, either hard or soft. 

TO REM0\T: GREASE FOR PAINTING. 

Before painting greasy furniture or a greasy partition, white- 
wash it over night, and wash all you can of the white-wash off in 
the morning. This removes the grease for painting. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

Pulverize a little stone blue with four ounces of whiting, mix 
them with an ounce of soda dissolved in very little water and four 
ounces of soft; soap, boil the mixture quarter of an hour over a 
slow fire, stirring constantly ; lay it on the marble with a brush while 
Itot, and let it lie half an hour ; wash it in warm water with flannel 
and scrubbing brush, and wipe it dry, 

MARKS ON A TABLE. 

To remove a whitish mark left by a hot dish or boiling water, 



MISCELLANEOUS. 287 

poiir lamp oil on, and rub hard with a soft cloth. Then pour on a 
little spirits of wine or cologne water, and rub dry with another 
cloth. 

FURNITURE. 

Beeswax and strong lye will clean and polish furniture. 

TO GIVE A FIXE COLOR TO MAHOGANY. 

Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having 
first taken out any ink stains there may be, with spirits of salts. 
Use the following liquid : — Into a pint of cold-drawn linseed oil, 
put four penny-worth of alkanet root, and two penny worth of rose 
pink, in an earthen vessel ; let it remain all night, then stirring 
well, rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag ; when it 
has lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths. 

TO CLEAN PAINT. 

Smear a piece of flannel with common whiting, mixed to the con- 
sistency of common paste in warm water. Rub the surface to be 
cleaned quite briskly and wash off with pure cold water. Grease 
spots and other filth will be removed. 

SOILED CARPETS. 

Sprinkle the carpet with dry Indian meal or wheat bran and 
sweep it hard. 

SCOURING FLOUR. 

A pound of soft soap, half a pound of soda and four quarts of 
water. Boil two hours and stir in a quart of silver sand. Use a 
small quantity at a time on the scrubbing brush. 

CHEAP PAINT. 

A cheap paint for a barn or rough woodwork, may be made of 
six pounds of melted pitch, one pint of linseed oil, and one pound 
of brick dust or yellow ochre. 

APERED WALLS. 

Rub the walls with a cloth sprinkled with Indian meal. Or gent- 
ly sweep off the dust and rub with soft muslin cloth. 



288 miscellaneous'. 



TO IRON RIBBONS. 

Heat an iron not too hot, turn it on the side and draw the wrong 
side of the ribbons over it quickly, holding them firmly to the iron. 

TO STIFFEN CRAPE. 

Hold it over potatoes or rice while boiling, and let it dry by 
the fire. 

TO REMOVE BROKEN SPOTS FROM VELVET. 

Hold the wrong side of the velvet over steam, and while damp 
draw the wrong side across a quite clean stove pipe, or a warm 
iron several times. 

TO CLEAN BLACK LACE VAILS. 

These are cleansed by passing them through a warm liquor of 
ox-gall and water, after which they must be rinsed in cold water, 
then finished as follows : Take a small piece of glue about the size 
of a bean, pour boiling water upon it, which will dissolve it, and 
when dissolved, pass the vail through it, then clap it between your 
hands and frame it or pin it out, taking care to keep the edge 
straight and even. 

WATER SPOTS IN BLACK CRAPE. 

Clap it while wet until dry. Spread the spot on the hand damp- 
ening it, if it has previously dried, and slap it with the other till 
the spots disappear. 

TO RENOVATE BLACK SILK. 

Sponge it with clear strong cold tea, shake it out, and hang it up 
to dry, or iron it while damp. Another way is, rip out the seams, 
rub it with a piece of crape, then put it in cold water twenty-four 
hours, iron it with a hot iron on the wrong side ; be careful not to 
wi'ing the silk. 

TO TAKE OUT MILDEW. 

Take your cloth when dry, wet thoroughly with soft soap and salt, 
mixed. Let it lie a short time, then wash it in a good suds and 
lay out to bleach. If one operation does not answer two will, 
and the linen will be clear and clean as ever. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 289 



TO TAKE INK OUT OF LINEN. 

Dip the portion that is stained in pure melted tallow ; then wash 
out the tallow and the ink will come out with it. Lemon juice, or 
any acid will generally take out any stain. Or dip the part stained 
in cold water, fill a basin with boiling water, place a pewter plate on 
the top, lay the muslin on the plate, put salts of lemon or tartaric 
acid on the ink spots, rubbing it with the bowl of a spoon, the spots 
will disappear. 

WASHING PRINT OR LAWN DRESSES. 

Boil a quart of bran, in a bag, in a gallon of water for an hour ; 
take out the bran and divide the water in which it was boiled, put- 
ting one-half to one gallon of warm water, in which the dresses 
are to be washed the first time, and the other half to a second gal- 
lon, in which they are to be rinsed or washed a second time ; this 
process needs neither soap nor starch, and makes the colors and 
consistency of the goods precisely the same as when new ; the ex- 
tract of bran cleans, sufficiently stiffens, and preserves the colors ; 
dry in the shade and iron on the wrong side. 

TO RESTORE LINEN THAT HAS LONG BEEN STAINED. 

Rub the stains on each side with wet, brown soap. Mix some 
starch to a thick paste with cold water, and spread it over the 
soaped places. Then expose the linen to the sun and air, and if 
the stains have not disappeared in three or four days, rub off the 
mixture, and repeat the process with fresh soap and starch. After- 
wards dry it ; wet it with cold water and put it in the wash. 

PAINT SPOTS ON CLOTH, SILK, ETC. 

When the stain is not yet dried, lay the cloth on a number of 
thicknesses of sheet, rub on soap with a tooth brush, then dip the 
brush in warm water and wash the paint away, the sheet beneath 
absorbing the water. Then wash the brush, dip it in the water, 
and with it wash the soap away. Then rub both sides of the ma- 
terial with a dry towel and hang it up to dry. If the paint is dry 
dip a piece of flannel in spirits of turpentine, rub the stain till re- 
moved, then wash out the turpentine quickly with soap and water, 
13 



290 MISCELLANEOUS. 

or if the color is very delicate with warm water alone, or the tur- 
pentine will leave a stain of itself. Spots of paint, or of pitch or 
tar anywhere, may be removed with spirits of turpentine. 

WASHING COLORED MUSLINS. 

To set the color of muslin, pour boiling water on the dress be- 
fore washing, and allow it to remain till quite cold. For washing 
green or blue muslin, take a little sugar of lead, dissolve it in a 
gallon of cold water, dip the dress in it, let it remain quarter of 
an hour, then wring it out and send it to be washed. Have no 
scars or scratches on your hand, and throw the water away im- 
mediately, for the sugar of lead is a rank poison. 

TO CLEAN SILK. 

Take a quarter of a pound of soft soap, a tea-spoonful of bran- 
dy, and a pint of gin ; mix all well together, and strain through a 
cloth. With a sponge or flannel, spread the mixture on each side 
of the silk without creasing it ; wash it in two or three waters, and 
iron it on the wrong side. It will look as good as new, and the 
process will not injure silks of even the most delicate color. 

TO CLEAN KID GLOVES. 

First see that your hands are clean, then put on your gloves, 
and wash them as though you were washing your hands, in a basin 
of turpentine until quite clean ; hang them up in a warm place, or 
where there is a current of air, which will carry off the smell of 
the turpentine. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

Put the gloves on your hands, and rub them lightly, but thor- 
oughly, wherever soiled, with a piece of flannel, soaked in benzine. 
As they dry off, rub them over with pearl powder, and expose 
them to the air to take off the smell of benzine. This is the way 
they are cleaned by French cleaners, and if done, before they are 
too much soiled, they can be made to look very nice by this 
method. 

IRON STAINS. 

These may be removed with juice of lemon, or of sorrel leaves. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 291 

but if these fail, moisten the stain spots with water and rub on a 
little powdered oxalic acid. AVash the acid off thoroughly soon 
after it is put on, or it will eat the cloth. Also wash it from your 
hands, and keep it away from children, for it is poisonous in the 
mouth. Ink stain may be taken out in this way. It must be no- 
ticed however that acids had better only be used on white as they 
vill discharge pink, lilac, and some other colors. 

GREASE SPOTS. 

An ounce of pulverized borax put into a quart of boiling water 
and bottled for use, will be found invaluable for removing grease 
spots from woolen goods. 

INK SPOTS IN BOOKS. 

Ink on printed leaves of books, may be removed by a solution 
of oxalic acid in water. The lamp-black of printers' ink is not affect- 
ed by it. 

GREASE ON A LEATHER COVERED BOOK. 

To remove this, rub the leather with white flannel briskly, and 
repeat until it disappears. This will remove grease from anything 
that will bear rubbing. 

TO REMOVE SPERMACETI SPOTS. 

First scrape off all you can, then place a piece of brown paper 
on the garment, or floor, covering the spots, and put a warm iron 
on the paper until the oil shows through, continue until no oil is 
drawn by the paper. 

MARKING INK. 

Put a little lunar caustic (nitrate of silver) into half a table- 
spoonful of gin, and in a day or two it is fit for use. Wet the linen 
with common soda and dry it before using the ink on it. The col- 
or will be faint at first, but will become durable on exposure to 
the sun or fire. 

GREEN INK 

Mix a solution of the neutral sulphate of indigo, with a solution 



292 MISCELLANEOXTS. 

of bichromate of* potash, until the desired shade is obtained, then 
add a little mucilage. A solution of verdigris also forms green 
ink. 

BLUE INK. 

Mix in a glass bottle, one ounce of pure powdered Prussian 
blue, and an ounce and a-half to two ounces of concentrated muri- 
atic acid. After twenty-four hours, dilute the mass with a suffi- 
cient quantity of water. 

GOLD AND SILVER INKS. 

Grind gold leaf with white honey upon a slab of porphyry, with a 
muUer, until it is reduced to an impalpable powder in a pasty condi- 
tion ; this golden honey-paste is then diflfused in water which dis- 
solves the honey, and the gold falls to the bottom in the form of very 
fine powder. Wash oflf the honey carefully, mix the gold powder 
with gum arabic mucilage. When used allow it to dry on the pa- 
per, when it may be made brilliant by burnishing it with an agate 
burnisher. Silver ink is prepared in the same way by using silver 
leaf. 

COCKROACHES. 

It is said that red wafers, and also the roots of black hellebore 
will destroy them. They may be caught in vessels partly filled 
with molasses. 

RATS AND MICE. 

You can have a little sport, by placing a barrel with a little meal 
in it where they run, two or three nights, and then fill it a third 
full of water, and sprinkle the meal two or three inches deep on 
th** top of it. You may find eight or ten in the barrel in the 
morning if they are plenty. You can use a smooth kettle, filHng 
it to within five or six inches of the top with water and covering 
the surface with bran, or chaflf. 

MOTHS. 

One ounce of gum camphor, and one ounce of powdered red 
pepper, macerated in eight ounces of strong alcohol for several

(lays, then strained. With this tincture, the furs or cloth are 
sprinkled over, and then rolled up in sheets. Or give them a 
good beating, and do them up tightly in several thicknesses of 
paper, so that one covers the cracks of the other ; or in linen or 
cotton so that the moth cannot get in. 

BED BUGS. 

Wash the bedstead with salt and water, filling the cracks where 
they frequent, with salt. It is preferable to " ointments." 

CRICKETS. 

Put Sctoch snuff in the holes where they come out. 

NOSEGAYS. 

Flowers should not be cut during sunshine or kept exposed to 
the sun, or tied tightly together in bundles. When putting them 
in water, cut the stems squarely across with a knife, scissors close 
the tubes through which the water ascends. The water should be 
changed every day or once in two days, and a thin slice cut off the 
end of the stalk every time. 

TO PRESERVE THE FLOWERS OF A BOUQUET. 

Let a spoonful of charcoal powder be added to the water, and 
the flowers will last as long as they would on the plant, without any 
need of changing the water or taking any trouble at all. 

HOW LADIES CAN MAKE THEIR OWN PERFUMES. 

If we spread fresh, unsalted butter upon the inside of two 
dessert-plates, and then fill one of the plates with gathered fra- 
grant blossoms of clematis, covering them over with the second 
greased plate, we shall find that after twenty-four hours the grease 
has become fragrant. The blossoms, though separated from the 
parent stem, do not die for some time, but live to exhale odor, 
which is absorbed by the fat. To remove the odor from the fat, the 
fat must be scraped off the plates and put into alcohol ; the odor then 
leaves the grease and enters into the spirit, which thus becomes 
** scent," and the grease again becomes colorless. The flower 
farmers of the Var, follow precisely this method, on a very large

scale, making but a little practical variation, with the following 
flowers : rose, orange, acacia, violet, jasmine, tube-rose, and 
jonquil. 

TINCTURE OF ROSES. 

Take the leaves of the common rose (centifolio) and place, with- 
out pressing them, in a common bottle ; pour some good spirits of 
wine upon them, close the bottle, and let it stand till required for 
use. This tincture will keep for years, and yield a perfume little 
inferior to attar of roses ; a few drops of it will suffice to impreg- 
nate the atmosphere of a room with a delicious odor. Common 
vinegar is greatly improved by a very small quantity being added 
to it. 

POT POURRI 

Take three handfuls of orange flowers, three of cloves, 
carnations, or pinks, three of damask roses, one of marjoram, one 
of lemon thymes, six bay leaves, a handful of rosemary, one of 
myrtle, half a handful of mint, one of lavender, the rind of a lemon, 
and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Chop these all up, and place 
them in layers, with bay salt between the layers, until the jar is full. 
Do not forget to throw in the bay salt with each new ingredient put 
in, should it not be convenient to procure at once all the required 
articles. The perfume is very fine. 

EASTER EGGS. — 1. 

Immerse eggs in hot water a few minutes, inscribe names or dates 
etc., on the shell with the end of a tallow candle or with grease, 
then place them in a pan of hot water saturated with cochineal or 
other dye-woods ; the parts over which the tallow has passed being 
impervious to the dye, the eggs come out presenting white inscrip- 
tions on colored grounds. Or boil the eggs hard and paint subjects 
on them with a camel's hair brush, or etch them with a steel pen in 
India ink. Or dye the shells first, then scrape oflf the dye in any 
design desired. 

EASTER EGGS. — 2. 

An egg boiled in the coat of an onion will turn to a beautiful 



MISCELLANEOirS. 295 

brown color. To give a blue color, boil the eggs in powdered 
indigo with the addition of a tea-spoonful of dilute sulpluric acid. 
To give an egg a mottled appearance, with bright colors blended, 
and contrasted, obtain pieces of silk of the brightest colors, cut them 
into bits an inch long, half an inch wide, add a few chips of log- 
wood and a little tumeric ; let the egg be well inbedded in this so 
that the silk may form a thick layer round it, sew it up in very 
coarse brown paper and boil it half an hour or more. 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 



The diet for invalids depends so mueh upon the condition of 
the patient, that only the most general directions can be given ; 
the special application must be left in every case to the judgment 
of the nurse. 

Neatness, (ileanliness, and promptitude are the great requisites 
in a sick chamber. The best prepared food is spoiled by want of 
care and punctuality in placing it before the patient. 

When persons are ill, their senses are often preternaturally acute ; 
slight marks of neglect which would not be noticed at another 
time, become extremely offensive ; and a few minutes delay, not 
only seems unpardonable, but is sometimes really injurious. Pa- 
tience, tact, and natural kindness of disposition are essential qual- 
ities in a good nurse, and when to these are added firmness and 
good judgment, the sum total of excellence in this line has been 
reached. As a general rule however, one half the nurses injure 
their patients by absurd restrictions, and the other half by foolish 



indulgence. 



GRUEL. 



This simple refreshment is invaluable in sickness, and is made 
with little trouble and less expense, yet it is scarcely ever prepared 
exactly right. 

Pne table-spoonful of fine Indian or oat-meal, mixed smooth 
with cold water and a salt-spoon of salt ; pour upon this a pint of 
boiling water and turn into a saucepan to boil gently for half an 
hour ; thin it with boiling water if it thickens too much, and stir 
frequently; when it is done, a table-spoonful of cream or a little 
new milk may be put in to cool it, after straining, but if the patient's 



FOOD FOE INVALIDS. 297 

stomach is weak it is best without either. Some persons like it 
sweetened and a little nutmeg added, but to many it is more palat- 
able plain. 

PANADA. 

Break up three arrow-root crackers into small pieces ; pour up- 
on them boiling water and cover close for a minute, then add a 
tea-spoon of white sugar and a little pure milk. It is an excellent 
breakfast or supper for a child or an invalid. Instead of the milk, 
the juice of a lemon may be squeezed in and another tea-spoon of 
sugar added . 

** soft" toast 

Some invalids like this very much Indeed, and nearly all do 
when it is nicely made. 

Toast well, but not too brown, a couple of thin slices of bread ; 
put them on a warm plate and pour over boiling water ; cover 
quickly with another plate of the same size, and drain the water 
off; remove the upper plate, butter the toast, put it in the oven 
one minute, and then cover again with a hot plate and serve at 
once. 

EGG TOAST. 

Make a soft toast, and have ready one or more fresh eggs which 
have been boiled twenty minutes; remove the shells, cut them in 
slices and place upon the toast, with a little butter, pepper and 
salt ; without the butter they may be eaten with impunity by the 
most delicate invalid, as an Qgg cooked for twenty minutes is real- 
ly more easy of digestion than one that is technically boiled soft. 

, CALVES-FOOT JELLY. 

Boil four nicely cleaned calves-feet in three quarts of water un- 
til reduced to one, very slowly ; strain and set away until cold, 
then take off the fat from the top and remove the jelly into a stew- 
pan, avoiding the settlings, and adding half a pound of white pow- 
dered sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the whites of two eggs — 
the latter to make it transparent. Boil all together a few moments 
and set away in bowls or glasses ; it is excellent in a sick room.

A SICK BREAKFAST. 

A small waiter, covered with a clean tea-napkin ; a cup of nice 
warm tea, two slices of thin, lightly-browned toast, a tiny pat of 
sweet butter, and a small saucer of fruit or jelly of some kind. 
Guava is very nice, if strawberries or other fresh fruits are not in 
season. 

A SICK DINNER. 

The thick, tender part of a mutton chop broiled, a roast mealy 
potato, a little jelly, a slice of Graham bread, and half of an *' in- 
valid's cup pudding." 

A SICK TEA. 

A bowl of cracker panada, or a cup of weak black tea, one or 
two slices of Graham bread, with a little butter, and fruit if allow- 
ed. 

INVALID CUP PUDDING. 

One table-spoonful of flour, one egg ; mix with cold milk, and 
a pinch of salt to a batter. Boil fifteen minutes in a buttered 
cup. Eat with sauce, fruit, or plain sugar. 

BEEF TEA. 

Cut up half a pound rump steak into small pieces, and put it 
into a bowl of lukewarm water ; cover it, and set it where it will 
gradually heat. In about half an hour, turn it into a lined sauce- 
pan, and cover close, and set it on the range to boil ,• skim it well 
as it reaches the boiling point, and after boiling up once or twice, 
withdraw it from the fire and let it simmer gently in a cooler place 
for an hour. Strain, and season as preferred. In winter this will 
keep good, in a cellar, several days ; but in summer it is required 
fresh every day, even if kept in a refrigerator. Mutton broth is 
made in the same way. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS. 

Fresh eggs for invalids who like them cooked soft, should be put 
in a pan of boiling water, and set on a part of the range where 



FOOD FOB INVALIDS. 299 

they will not boil, for several minutes. At the end of that time 
they will be like jelly, perfectly soft, but beautifully done, and 
quite digestible by even weak stomachs. 

INVALID APPLE PIE. 

Slice up one or more nice, tart apples in a saucer, sweeten with 
white sugar, and cover with a moderately thick slice of bread but- 
tered slightly on the under side. Wheu the bread is browned, 
the apples, if of a tender kind, and thinly sliced, will be done. 

ROAST APPLES. 

These can nearly always be eaten with safety, when they are eat- 
en with relish. Choose good sized, fair apples of a tart, and juicy, 
but not sour kind. Rub them off clean, and put them in rather a 
slow oven, which may increase in warmth, so that they shall be 
thoroughly done in an hour. When so soft that the savory pulp 
breaks through the browned skin in every direction, take them 
out, sift white sugar over them, and carry one at a time on a China 
saucer to the patient. 

LEMONADE. 

This is invaluable in fevers, and also in rheumatic affections. 
Rub the lemons soft, cut them half through the centre and squeeze 
out the juice, take out the seeds with a tea-spoon. Put two table- 
spoonsful of white sugar to each lemon, and fill up with cold or 
boiling water, according as you desire the lemonade, hot, or cold. 
Two medium sized lemons will make a pint or more of lemonade. 

APPLE WATER. 

Roast two tart apples until they are soft, put them in a pitcher, 
pour upon them a pint of cold water and let it stand in a cool place 
an hour. It is used in fevers and eruptive diseases, and does not 
require sweetening. 

STEWED PRUNES. 

These are extremely good in small pox, measles, scarlet fever, 
and the like, both as food and medicine. Get the box prunes, as 
they will not need washing, and because they are generally of 



300 FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 

a much better quality than the open sort. Soak them for an hour 
in cold water, then put them in a porcelain lined saucepan with a 
little more water if necessary, and a little coffee crushed sugar. 
Cover, and let them stew slowly an hour, or until they are swollen 
large and quite soft. They are excellent as an accompanunent to 
breakfast for a sick woman. 

DRY TOAST. 

Cut your slices of bread even, and not too thick. Toast before 
a clear fire, a nice light brown. Cover with a napkin, and serve 
quickly while it is hot. Dry toast is not always good for invalids, 
especially when the bowels are confined, and it is desirable to keep 
them open. In this case, Graham bread not toasted is much better. 

TAPIOCA CUP PUDDING. 

This is very light, and delicate for invalids. An even table- 
spoonful of tapioca, soaked for two hours in nearly a cup of new 
milk. Stir into this the yolk of a fresh egg, a little sugar, a grain 
of salt and bake in a cup for fifteen minutes. A little jelly may 
be eaten with it, if allowed, or a few fresh strawberries. 

anXK TOAST. 

This is a favorite dish with nearly all sick people when they are 
getting well. Cut stale baker's bread in rather thin slices, toast a 
fine brown, and lay them in a deep dish. Meanwhile, boil a quart 
of new milk, in a lined saucepan, into which you have first put a 
very little cold water to prevent burning. As soon as it boils, pour 
it over the toast, cover, and serve quick. For an invalid, no butter 
should be put in the milk. Some people put in a thickening of 
flour, but this spoils it to our thinking. 

THICKENED MILK. 

With a little milk, mix smooth a table-spoonful of flour and a 
pinch of salt. Pour upon it a quart of boiling milk, and when it 
is thoroughly amalgamated put all back into the saucepan, and boil 
up once, being careful not to bum, and stirring all the time, to 
keep it perfectly smooth, and free from lumps. Serve with slices 
of dry toast. It is excellent in diarrhea and becomes a specific by 
scorching the flour before mixing with the milk. 



FOOD FOE IXVALIDS. 301 



OYSTER SOUP. 

Make a little broth of lean veal, or mutton, simmer with it some 
root, or essence of celery. Strain it, put again on the fire, and 
when it boils throw in the oysters with their liquor,- and a trifle of 
pepper, and salt. Serve as soon as it comes to a boil on little 
squares, or sippets of toast. 

BROILED TENDERLOIN. 

This is a choice piece from a sirloin steak, and is highly enjoyed 
when the patient is becoming convalescent. Cut out the round 
piece from the inside of a sirloin steak, boil it quick over a bright 
fire, upon a small, heated gridiron, turn it, with its gravy, upon a 
piece of freshly made toast, sprinkle with salt, and pepper, but no 
butter, place between two hot plates, and serve directly. A ten- 
der mutton chop, or half of the breast of a chicken may be served 
the same way, only the chicken will require longer, and somewhat 
slower cooking. 

MILK AND EGGS. 

Beat up a fresh egg, with a grain of salt, pour upon it a pint of 
boiling milk, stirring all the time. Serve hot, with or without 
toast. It is good in case of weakness for an early breakfast, or 
for a traveller before starting on a journey. 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 



It is a sad, and significant fact, that at least half the children at 
the present time, are deprived of their proper sustenance, and 
left to the tender mercies of wet nurses, or the bottle. Between 
the two evils, it is difficult to say which is the least ; but unless a 
superior nurse can be found — one intelligent, and thoroughly clean 
in her personal habits — we should say, choose the last, and bring 
it up by hand. 

It is the opinion of the best physicians, and the conviction is 
borne out by every mother's experience, that the moral, mental, 
and spiritual, as well as physical condition of a child is greatly in- 
fluenced during its nursing period. Mothers who nurse their own 
children know that it is of the greatest importance to the quiet and 
healthful condition of the child, that they should be free from all 
sources of agitation, anxiety, and irritability. Overwork, giving 
way to fretfulness, or being subjected to the unreasonable temper 
and caprices of others, frequently induces a state of mind that shows 
itself plainly in the uneasiness and disquiet it produces in the in- 
fant, and would be seen with still greater distinctness were women 
accustomed to trace results more strictly to their causes. 

If this is the case with the mother, if her mental and spiritual 
condition finds itself reflected so minutely in the lights and shadows 
of the little life which is dependent upon her, why should it not re- 
ceive a coloring from the milk which it derives from a dull , coarse, 
appetite-loving wet nurse of the ordinary stamp ? Two thirds of 
these nurses make a necessity of strong tea and coflfee, and malt 
liquor, two or three times a day; they are often anything but 
scrupulous in their personal habits, and so accustomed to the ex-

ercise of a violent will by virtue of their office, as to be unwilling 
to bear the slightest control or contradiction. These are not the 
influences which a thoughtful mother would like to have her child 
drink in with its milk. 

We believe it to be a misfortune, the extent of which is not at 
all realized, when the mother cannot nurse her own child. The 
mother's milk contains all the elements necessary for its proper 
growth in every direction, and no substitute can be found for it ; 
but where this is impossible, unless, as before remarked, a very 
superior nurse can be obtained, it is safer to trust to the simple 
food, which at least sustain life, and do no hurt if given at right 
times and in proper quantities, leaving the mental and spiritual ac- 
tivities unimpeded, though probably subject to a slower grow^^ 
than if aided by the sympathetic magnetism of the mother''s na- 
ture. 

STARCHY FOOD. 

Such as arrowroot, sago, corn-starch, and the like, is commonly 
held to be very healthy and nutritious for infants, yet the experi- 
ence of every physician, furnishes numerous instances of feeble, 
sickly children that are so fed, while the number is small that sur- 
vive it. The reason of this is, that the digestive organs of infants 
are not sufficiently powerful to convert the starchy matter into 
nourishment ; it therefore only serves to clog, an d impede the ac- 
tion of the system, while the little victim is gradually being starved 
on the trifle of sustenance which it can obtain, from whatever su- 
gar and milk is given with its other food. 

ENGLISH " PAP. 

English and French babies, when brought up by hand, are fe d 
almost altogether on '* pap," which is made, in England, in the fol- 
lowing way : 

Boiling water is poured on a small piece of the crumby part of 
white, light bread. This is covered up for a moment, and then 
the water poured off. The softened bread is then put in a little 
porcelain stewpan, with a trifle more of water, and allowed to boil 
up, and it is then a pulp. A lump of white sugar and a little cold 
milk, added, brings it precisely up to the ideas of most young 



304 FOOD FOE INFANTS, 

Britishers, who grow very stout and healthy upon it. This is ex- 
cellent food where the mother is capable of partly nursing her 
child. 

French pap is made of flour instead of bread, which is decided- 
ly objectionable, as it is not only less agreeable, but much less 
easily digested. 

cow's MILK. 

A diet of cows' milk exclusively is not good ; it is too rich and 
very provocative of eruptive diseases. But if the bottle is pre- 
ferred to spoon-feeding, half of one good cow's milk may be given, 
diluted with half of boiling water and sweetened slightly with 
white sugar. 

An excellent change from this consists of a thin strained gruel 
from the best prepared barley, with a little milk and sugar added. 

A little sugar is necessary in infants' food, but be particularly 
careful not to make it sweet, as this provokes continual thirst, as 
well as disorders the child's stomach. 

infant's broth 

After the baby is three months old, it may occasionally be treat- 
ed to a little clear chicken, or mutton broth, made in the following 
way. Cut up a pound of lean mutton into small pieces, and put 
them into a small jar, cover them with cold water, set the jar in a 
kettle of warm water, let it come to boiling point, and simmer the 
mutton until the strength is extracted. One pound of meat should 
make a quart of broth — simmer at least six hours — strain and put 
in a trifle of salt, but no other spice. Treat part of a chicken 
in the same way, for chicken broth. 

BABY PUDDING. 

Grate a little stale bread, pour some boiling milk upon it, cover, 
and when it becomes a pulp, stir into it the yolk of an egg, and a 
grain of salt. The quantity should fill a tea-cup, m which boil it 
fifteen minutes. 

ESSENTIALS. - 

Warm, sensible clothing, quiet, with food and sleep at regular 
intervals are the essentials to health and comfort of babies^ 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN. 305 



FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. 

The great danger in feeding young children lies not so much in 

the food, as in its preparation, or want of preparation. A hard 

^indigestible potato is bad for them, and a little tender, stewed 

meat is good, but if the potato were mashed, and mealy, and 

the meat hard, and tough, the case would be just the reverse. 

The principal danger is in their swallowing indigestible sub- 
stances, and whether these are hard apples, or lumpy potatoes, 
tough meat, or sour bread, rich cake, or hickory nuts, makes very 
little diflference, the irritation, and derangement produced is the 
same. 

Meat for children under the age of ten years, should be cooked 
very tender, and cut up very small, or given in the form of soup. 
Potatoes should be mashed, apples roasted, or stewed, and if 
bread and milk could form their breakfast, and some kind of 
mush.with milk, their supper, they would be all the better for it, 
for the rest of their lives. 

CHILDREN 8 PIE. 

Cover the bottom of a pie dish with slices of bread and butter, 
cover it with fresh berries, sprinkled with sugar, or with stewed 
fruit, fresh or dried. Set it in the oven fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Sift a little sugar over it, when it comes out. 

BROWN MUSH FOR SUPPER. 

Stir into a quart of boiling water, a tea-spoonful of salt, and 
Graham flour enough to make it as thick as Indian mush. Let it 
boil gently half an hour, keeping it covered. Eat it with cream, 
or milk, and sugar. 

BREAD AND MILK. 

Cut, or break stale bread up into small pieces, and let them come 
to a boil in milk. It makes an excellent breakfast for children 
with a slice of toast, or without. 

CRANBERRIES. 

Should be stewed soft, strained through a colander, which will 



306 ladies' lunches. 

pass every thing but the skin ; boild up a second time with the 
sugar, and set away to cool. They may then be eaten with im- 
punity by the most delicate children. 



LADIES' LUNCHES. 

These are not at all difficult, and the less fuss and preparation 
there is for them, the better ; they may of course be made very 
elaborate, but in this case, it has become the fashion for ladies to 
engage a private room and lunch, for a certain number of guests, 
at a stylish restaurant, the hour, and extensive preparation, inter- 
fering with domestic economies, and regulations of the household, 
if allowed to take place at home. 

Ordinarily however, ** ladies' lunches," are simple aflfairs, delicate, 
recherche, and more famous for the wit they evoke, and the enjoy- 
ment they create, than for the dishes, which are not unfrequently 
quite incongruous. '* I will come," says one, " if you will have some 
of your delicious chicken salad;" "and I," says another, **if 
you can persuade your cook to make an omelette," *' and I, — I 
want a cup of your chocolate," exclaims a third. 

But whatever be the bill of fare, let it be such, that the presence 
of the hostess will not be required in the kitchen, nor a large at- 
tendance of servants in removing dishes. 

Many of the pleasantest lunches are quite impromptu ; one or 
more ladies call, — gentlemen nearly always lunch down town, in 
cities, — and the hostess without ceremony invites them to share her 
mid-day meal. In such a case, no apology is necessary for very 
simple fare, the friendliness of the invitation being worth much 
more than variety, and costliness of dishes. 

A dish of poached eggs and boiled ham, will answer for such an 
occasion, or delicate rice cakes, added to the cold ham, and chickens 
or sliced tomatoes with tender broiled lamb chops ; all dishes easily 
and cheaply prepared, and sure to be appreciated. A box of 
sardines is useful to have on hand, but we do not consider them 
healthful eating, and recommend them only in case of emergency. 
To a ladles' lunch, not more than six or eight guests should be 



ladies' lunches. 307 

invited, and the food should be all placed on the table at one time, 
tea, coflfee, or chocolate being served from a side table by a ser- 
vant. 

BILL OF FARE. 

Roast chicken garnished, ham sandwiches, pancakes with jelly, 
French rolls, potato balls, or croquettes ^ wine jelly, lady cake, tart- 
lets, and oranges. 

Lobster salad, mixed pickles, French bread, cold tongue, mar- 
malade, meringues, oranges, and claret punch. 

Chicken pie, compote apples, or apples stewed whole ; cold ham 
garnished with sliced lemon and parsley, bread, biscuits, pickled 
cucumbers, tartlets, sponge cake with a custard poured over it, 
and whip on top of it, making floating island; and bottled 
peaches, or strawberries. 

Potted salmon, and pigeon pie, currant and raspberry jelly, 
delicate biscuits, celery or salad of lettuce, cheese cakes, cocoa- 
nut cake, and fresh fruit in season. 

Cold roast turkey, pickled oysters, cranberry jelly, celery, 
French rolls, small English mince pies, (made without meat), jel- 
ly cake, and grapes, or preserved pineapple. 

Cold pigeons which have been stuffed and roasted, little oyster 
patties, or vol au vente, blackberry jelly, and pickled cauliflower, 
with slices of red beet root ; blanc mange, with tarts, and cream, 
fruit cake, with grapes, and wine. 



A STAG SUPPER. 

A stag supper is one to which only gentleman are invited, and 
it is necessary, therefore, to pay particular attention to the dishes 
which gentlemen usually prefer. The centre of the table should 
be occupied by a large punch-bowl, filled with claret punch, and 



308 A STAG SUPPER. 

set in a deep reservoir, containing blocks of clear ice. At tlie top 
of the table should be a cold roast turkey with a string of sausages 
round its neck ; at the bottom, a boiled turkey, stuffed with oys- 
ters. On one side of the table should be a large chicken pie, or- 
namented with pastry, on the other, a pair of roast ducks, one 
stuffed with onions, the other with prunes. At opposite corners, 
tureens of pickled oysters, a cold boiled ham, and cold tongue, 
garnished with slices of lemon, and green parsley. French bread, 
pickles, pineapple, cheese, sardines and champagne jelly, where- 
ever it is possible to put them ; also oval dishes of lobster salad, 
potted meat sandwiches, and pickled salmon. Celery, grapes, 
apples, oranges, ice cream, and cream cakes, or Charlotte Knsse. 
Beverages, according to taste and means. 



NEW YEAR'S TABLES, PARTIES, Etc. 



It does not come within the scope of this work to give direc- 
tions for the getting up of elaborate and expensive entertainments. 
People who do these things, generally have a professed cook, or 
have their table supplied from some fashionable restaurant. We 
propose only to furnish useful hints to plain housekeepers with 
limited resources, and shall therefore not go beyond those simple 
means of entertainment that are within the power of most Ameri- 
can families. 

NEW YEAH'S TABLE 

The custom of receiving calls is becoming so very general out 
of New York city, that a few hints on the method of setting the 
table for the occasion may not come amiss. 

What is called a substantial table, is out of fashion now, except- 
ing among old-fashioned people, but it must still be remembered 
that as it is the taste of gentlemen, and not of ladies that are to be 
consulted on this day, sweets, cake and the like, should be subor- 
dinated to chicken salad, pickled oysters, potted salmon, sardines, 
and the like, which gentlemen generally greatly prefer. 

An average table displays one handsomely ornamented cake, 
raised high on a china, glass or silver plateau, in the centre, sup- 
ported by bouquets of flowers. All the dishes are cold, of course, 
and maybe decorated with little bits of evergreen, with flowers or 
with lemon in slices. Small biscuit sandwiches made of tongue 
and ham, or ham and potted veal, are very good. Pickled oys- 
ters, are indispensable, and sardines, and chicken, or lobster salad, 
will be found very popular. Jellies, fruit, one or more baskets of 
mixed cake, and whatever is thought requisite in the way of con- 
fectionery, should be arranged tastefully so as to produce the best 



310 NEW teak's tables, parties, etc. 

effect. A dish of oranges ornamented with tufts of green moss., 
and sprigs of scarlet geranium looks very nice. 

It would be much better if no wines were offered New Year's day, 
— if beverages were limited to coffee, lemonade, and cold water ; 
but as most persons seem to think otherwise, it would be Quixotic 
to attempt here to stem the tide of fashionable opinion. Cherry, 
old Bourbon, and claret punch are in great demand where they 
are to be found. Coffee is always served from a side table. 

A FAMILY DINNER. BILL OF FARE FOR TEN. 

Soup is not considered so indispensable to even elegant dinners 
in this country, as in England and France ; though it is generally ^ 
even here, the first course. For our family dinner party however, 
we have no soups ; but we have two kinds of fish, — baked salmon 
trout, with anchovy sauce, and boiled white fish, with caper sauce. 
We have, also, small side dishes of lobster and chicken salad ; pick- 
les, and glass dishes of white, crimped celery, and cranberry jelly. 
The fish is followed by a roast turkey with its necklace of sau- 
sages, or a roast fowl, and dish of stewed pigeons, ; and these are 
accompanied by an army of vegetables, sauces, and gravies. A 
boiled ham makes it appearance, but it is chiefly ornamental. The 
next course is plum pudding, and then comes a dessert of white, 
and black grapes, oranges, apples, and nuts, Charlotte Russe, or 
cream puffs, and finally, coffee. Sometimes we have wine, and 
sometimes we don't, at family dinners. 

A SMALL SUPPER PARTY. BILL OF FARE FOR FIFTY PERSONS. 

Have at one end of the table a tureen of pickled oysters, at the 
other, a large dish of chicken salad. Side dishes should contain 
neat slices of ham, tongue, cold chicken, and sardines, ornamented 
with sprigs of parsley, slices of lemon, red beet root, cut in stars, 
or the curled leaves of celery. Chicken salad may be garnished 
with egg rings, and celery hearts, cut in shapes, and stuck all 
over the surface. Two pyramids of ice cream will occupy the 
spaces next to the top and bottom dishes, and will be followed by 
two handsome baskets of cake, which will just leave room for a 
pyramid of confectionery, or a high glass dish of fruit in the cen- 
tre. Filling up the corners, will be glass dishes of jelly, Charlotte 



NEW year's parties, REFRESHMENTS, ETC. 311 

Russe in forms, and little dishes of pickles, and plates of biscuit 
everywhere ; there should also be at least two dishes of mottoes, 
and two of almonds and raisins. Care should be taken to have 
abundance of plates, saucers, spoons, and napkins. Hot coffee 
should be served round at the beginning, and champagne punch at 
the close ; or if not that, claret punch. It is a good idea to have 
an immense punch bowl of iced lemonade, for the guests to go to 
whenever they choose. 

REFRESHMENTS. 

For sociables, receptions, and small evening companies, re- 
freshments are generally handed round, and are of a very simple 
character. A variety of cake with jelly, and ice cream, are per- 
haps the most frequently employed, with or without wine. Coffee, 
and little biscuit sandwiches, with cake, and fruit, are sometimes 
substituted. 

At simple receptions, a cup of tea, or coffee, and a little cake, 
or biscuit is all that is required. 

Do not, however, confine yourself to lady-fingers, or any of the 
polite forms of starvation. If you have only tea and cake, let the 
tea be good, and the cake good ; and allow your visitors the priv- 
ilege of having their cups refilled. 

A children's PARTY. 

Let the children give a party at least once a year, and make out 
a programme of amusements for them ; a magic lantern is very 
useful, in addition to games and dancing. Let the children them- 
selves principally da the honors, it will teach them how to receive 
and entertain guests. 

It is best to have a table set for the children, and make the re- 
freshments as light and simple as possible. Little baked custards 
in cups, apple snow, ice cream, baskets of kisses, lady-fingers, 
and "Christmas cakes for good children" [see Sweet Cakes], small 
apple tarts, oranges, and mottoes, with water and lemonade, con- 
stitute a suflicient, and to juveniles, a most attractive variety. It 
is still better if the mottoes are not given them to eat, but are 
fewer in quality, and suflSciently handsome to carry home as a 
souvenir. The party should close with a lively game before twelve 



312 PARTIES, REFRESHMENTS, ETC. 

o'clock, SO that the little ones may be at home by midnight at 
least. 

A CHRISTMAS PARTY. 

A Christmas party, which includes a Christmas tree, is the most 
delightful of all parties ; it is not particularly fashionable, and it is 
particularly unceremonious, but on that account all the more en- 
joyable. 

At first sight, a Christmas tree, with a gift for every person in- 
vited, would seem to involve great expense, but it need not, if 
people will content themselves with furnishing the tree with such 
gifts as their means will admit. Twenty-five dollars will purchase 
a large tree, decorate it with flowers and lights, and supply pretty 
and amusing gifts for fifty or more persons. Fifteen or twenty 
dollars more, will supply all the refreshments, in the shape of cake, 
and ice cream, and home made jellies, or fruits needed. A« im- 
provised Santa Claus distributes the gifts by lot at a certain hour, 
then follows refreshments, and the evening closes with dancing, 
and perhaps a game of blind man's buff. 

Of course, family and other Christmas trees, may be made as 
elaborate and expensive in their furnishing, as means will allow ; 
we have only thrown out the suggestion, to show how cheaply it 
may be done. 



WASHING DAY. 



WASHING DAY. 



This is the dreaded event of every household, large, and small ; 
it is proverbially associated with wretchedness and discomfort, and 
many have been the plans, methods, and receipts, which have been 
imposed upon housekeepers, through their desire to relieve them- 
selves of this constantly recurring source of trouble and annoy- 
ance. 

Such efforts, are mostly vain, and useless however, sometimes 
worse — ^positively injurious. Clean clothes are a luxury, that must 
be paid for in some shape or other — and no substances have been 
discovered, and few machines invented, to rival the stout arm, and 
strong hand of the professional wash-woman. 

Never use soda to soften water, it rots the clothes in proportion 
to its strength ; buy crude borax by the pound, and put in half an 
ounce for an ordinary washing; it whitens, and cleanses, and 
softens, wonderfully, and injures nothing. The women of Holland, 
whose washing is proverbial, use borax. 

Use a really good brand of soap well dried — not the soft, gela- 
tinous, yellow bars, which melt away in a moment, and really 
stain rather than cleanse the clothes, and always destroy the hands. 

Have the clothes soaked over night in warm water, rubbing all 
creased and soiled places with soap, and they will require only 
one washing, and that not a laborious one, before boiling. Boil 
quick, rinse thoroughly, wring through a first-rate clothes wringer, 
(the barbarism of wringing by hand, is now happily at an end) 
and bring them in, and fold them as soon as they are dry. Fine? 
shirts, ruffles, and linen, and cambric under clothing, are much 
injured by being exposed an unnecessary length of time to frost, 
wind, or dust. 

14 



314 WASHING DAY. 



TABLE-CLOTHS, NAPKINS, ETC. 

These articles, and any others that are likely to be disfigured 
with fruit, or coffee stains, should be kept back from the general 
soaking, in order to undergo special treatment. Put these in a 
small tub by themselves — and pour a kettle of hoiling water upon 
them — not hot, but boiling, hot water sets stains, boiling water 
takes them out clean. When the water has cooled a little, wash 
them thoroughly, and boil them, the stains will have probably all 
disappeared, but if they should prove very obstinate, lay them on 
the grass wet, when the sun is hot, and they will vanish. 

WHITE FLANNELS. 

White flannel garments, such as petticoats, underskirts and 
drawers, baby flannels and the like, require also to be put in boil- 
ing water. The very best way to wash white flannels is by ma- 
chine. Put in the flannels, pour in boiling suds, mild, let them 
stand a few minutes, then grind them out. Pour the suds away, 
put the flannels in again, and pour over them a kettle of clear 
boiling water with a pinch of crude borax in it, and grind them 
out of that. This finishes the process, and makes them beautiful- 
ly soft and clean, with little labor, and no danger of shrinkage. 

ZEPHYR GOODS AND COLORED FLANNELS. 

Colored flannel dresses, sacks. Garibaldis and other articles of 
knitted wool, such as baby socks, knitted sacks and the like, should 
all be washed in cold water, in which a little crude borax has been dis- 
solved, and with fine white soap, white Castile is best, but don't take 
coloredCastile, as that may stain. The process will be found very 
easy, and perfectly satisfactoi y ; the dirt ■will come out in the cold 
water without any trouble ; there will be no shrinking, and the col- 
or will remain bright in the colored woolens, or fancy borderings. 

TO WASH LACES AND NEEDLEWORK. 

Fine handkerchiefs, collars, undersleeves , chemisettes and edg- 
ings should never be put into the large " wash," they should be kept 
till a sufficient number has accumulated, and then on a rainy day, 
when visitors Jire not expected, collect them, mend carefully every 



WASHING DAY. 315 

L'ttle hole, soap them and put them in a clean, bright tin pail that 
will cover down close, and fill up with cold water with a pinch of 
borax in it. Let them come to a slow boil, then squeeze them 
out ; if they are very yellow, and very dirty, the operation may 
have to be repeated. Rinse and dry ; in the meantime pour a little 
boiling water over a few lumps of loaf sugar, and if you wish a 
yellow tinge add a table-spoonlul of clear liquid coflfee, instead of 
starch ; lay the articles straight out in clean, dry towels, and by 
the time the last one is folded up, the first will be ready to iron. 
JPoint lace can be washed in this way to look like new. 

BLONDE LACE, TO WASH. 

Very old point, or blonde lace, can be washed successfully in the 
following way. Wind the lace smoothly round a bottle, and a strip 
of old linen outside of it, so as to cover it. Let it lay in the bot- 
tom of a wash tub while the first and best clothes are being wash- 
ed, and transfer it to the top of the clothes while they are boiling. 
Thence take it and lay it in boiling water, which has been slightly 
colored with liquid coffee, and sweetened with loaf sugar. Press 
out the moisture, and dry near a fire, or in the sun, and iron care- 
fully while still damp. 

MUSLIN, LAWN, OR PRINT DRESSES. 

An excellent, and sure way to wash lawn, print, or muslin dress- 
es, is to put one or two quarts of bran in a bag, and boil it in two 
or four gallons of water. When the strength is extracted, take 
out the bag, and wash the dresses in the bran water. It will act 
both as soap and starch, cleansing and stiffening them perfectly, 
without any danger to their color. Once rinsing is sufficient, in 
water into which some of the bran water has been poured. 

COLORED STARCH. 

Colored starch is the latest and greatest novelty in the laundry 
line. It is made in pink, buff, the new mauve, and a delicate 
green, and blue will soon be produced. Any article starched with 
the new preparation is completely colored — dyed we should have 
said, but as it washes out, and the garment that was pink to-day 
may be green to-morrow, and buff afterwards, we can hardly say 



316 WASHING DAY. 

♦' dyed." It is intended especially for those bright but treacherous- 
ly colored muslins, that are costly, wash out, and perplex their 
owners. If the pattern has been mauve, they only need the mauve 
starch ; if green, green starch ; and they can be rendered one 
even and pretty shade, thus becoming not only wearable again, 
but stylish. 

HOW TO STARCH SHHITS, AND OTHER THINGS. 

Put into a thin muslin bag, a quarter of a pound of "best" 
starch. Soak it for ten or fifteen minutes in three pints of pure, 
soft water, into which drop a minute quantity of fine French " blue." 
Squeeze all the starch out of the bag, and dip the shirts, and those 
articles that require to be very stiff first. Afterwards it can be 
thinned for children"'s aprons, and such things as only require to go 
through water starch. This quantity will stiffen three or four 
dozen miscellaneous articles, which will be ready for ironing im- 
mediately. One trial will convince the most sceptical that this 
method is infinitely better, less laborious, and more economical than 
boiled starch. 

SAVING SOAP. 

Pour on half a pound of washing soda two quarts of boiling 
water, take half a pound of soap, cut up fine in a saucepan, and 
pour over it two quarts of cold water; let it boil, and when per- 
fectly dissolved, add it to the other. Mix it well upon the fire, 
set it away to get cold, and it will look like jelly. Soak your 
clothes over night, rub them out of the water, put half a pint of 
your saving soap into your boiler, with cold water, and put your 
clothes into the cold water, let all come to a boil together, then 
take out the linen, and rinse thoroughly. This will keep clothes a 
splendid color, with half the usual labor. 



THE DAIRY. 



THE COWS. 

Attend very particularly to the food and drink of the cows ; 
and see that they have clean pasture of timothy, or herds grass, 
and have pure, clean, water to drink. If cows are suffered to run 
where they can find such things as leaves, garlic, and weeds, they 
will often eat thera, and drink stagnant water ; all of which tend 
to give a bad flavor to butter. 

THE MILK ROOM. 

The milk room is much cooler when situated on the north side 
of the house, where it is not exposed to the hot sun through the 
whole day ; or the shade of large tall trees is very beneficial. The 
object should be to have it as cool as possible, without being damp. 
The room and utensils should be kept as clean and sweet, as hot 
and cold water and pure air, can make them. Close watchfulness 
of the milk is required; if it stands too long, it will make bad 
flavored butter, less of it, and will require more labor to churn 
and work it. Strain your milk into shallow pans ; it should not 
stand over thirty-six hours ; if your pans have no legs, that raise 
thera a little from the shelves, place small blocks of marble or 
wood, under them, so that the air can circulate under them. When 
washing dairy pans, and pails,^lways put cold water in them first 
and wash thoroughly ; add a little warm water if you prefer it. 

MAKING BUTTER. 

Cream should not be kept more than two days in summer, and 
if there is sufficient cream to churn daily, it is better to do so. 
Skim the milk before it becomes very sour ; pass a silver spoon 



318 THE DAIRY. 

handle around the edge of the pan, lift the cream with a perforated 
skimmer, and put it immediately into the cream crock; stir the 
cream two or three times each day briskly until it is ready to churn, 
when usually it will come quickly. Churning should be done, dur- 
ing warm weather, early in the morning in a cool place ; the dash- 
er ought to be moved slowly and regularly at first, and then more 
brisk until the butter separates from the milk ; when it is gather- 
ed, wet the bowl and ladle, first with a little warm water, and 
then put plenty of cold or ice water to them ; pour out the water 
and take up the butter ; drain off as much of the butter-milk, as 
possible, pressing the butter a moment gently with the ladle. 

Scatter a handful of salt in the bowl before putting in the butter ; 
then throw a little salt upon the butter, and mix it in ; drain off 
all the water, and make indentations in the butter with the ladle, 
fill them with nice salt, and set the bowl in a cool place. At eve- 
ning, when the butter is hard, work it gently, without breaking 
the grain, and squeeze out all the milk that can be removed with- 
out too much pressure. Salt to the taste, and let it stand until 
morning, then finish it, making it into rolls, or packing it. When 
it is finished and becomes hard or set, every working over or 
changing from one vessel to another injures it, rendering It soft, 
and pasty, and breaking the grain. It will never again be as firm 
or nice in flavor, and will not keep sweet as long. If the butter 
is for packing, put it in the firkin as soon as possible, from the air. 
Pack close until nearly full, for room should be left to pour on 
enough nice brine to cover the butter. This is made by pouring 
boiling water upon salt, and when it is cold, straining it through a 
cloth. Pour enough of this brine upon the butter to cover it, say 
a quarter of an inch, or half an inch in thickness ; this kept upon 
butter entirely excludes the air, and keeps it sweet and good as 
when first packed. If it is to be sent away, pour oflf the brine, 
saturate a cloth in it, lay it on the top, and cover it with a thick 
layer of salt. 



JEWISH RECEIPTS. 



These are all original and reliable, — the contribution of a su- 
perior Jewish housekeeper in New York. 



WHITE STEWED FISH. 

Put on as much water to boil as is required to cover six or eight 
steaks of striped bass, boil in it one onion, sliced thin, a little ground 
ginger, salt, black pepper and a small quantity of whole red pepper. 
When these are done put in your slices of fish ; when boiled take 
them up carefully, drain them and lay in a dish. Beat up six eggs, to 
which add a little nutmeg, a little cayenne pepper, and some parsley 
chopped fine. In a separate bowl strain the juice of three or four 
lemons, to this add one half pint of the liquor in which the fish has 
been boiled, which must be strained ; when this is done, take the 
liquor which is mixed with the lemons and throw it into the eggs, 
beating them all the time. Take a china or iron saucepan, into it 
put the sauce, set it on a gentle fire, stirring it all the time until it 
thickens a little, it must on no account be boiled as it will curdle ; 
then throw the sauce over the fish and put it to cool. Chicken 
can be served in the same way. 

BROWN FRICASSEE CHICKEN. 

Take a chicken, cut it up in pieces and fry them brown, cither in 
the best sweet oil or rendered fat. Then take six onions, slice 
them and cover them in a frying-pan with enough oil or fat to fry 
them ; when soft take the cover off, so as to let them brown, then 
scald and peal two tomatoes, cut them up and put them in the pan 
with the onions to simmer a little. Put the fried chicken into a 
saucepan with the onions etc., add a little thyme, pepper, salt and 



320 JEWISH RECEIPTS. 

a few grams of allspice, and enough hot water to make a rich gra- 
vy ; cover it up and let it cook for half an hour or an hour, according 
to the tenderness of the chicken ; a very small piece of garlic and 
mace can be added when cooking, if liked. 

A GOOD PUDDING. 

Take one half pound of bread crumbs, six ounces of white su- 
gar, pour over it one half pint of boiling milk, let it stand till 
nearly cold, then work into it one fourth pound of fresh butter un- 
til it becomes very white. Then add four eggs, one at a time, 
stirring ; it must bo well beaten between each ; then add the rind 
grated, and the juice of a lemon ; take a mould, butter and paper 
it well, then ornament it with candied peel and raisins, according 
to fancy. Pour into it the ingredients, put a paper over the top, 
also tie in a cloth, and let it steam gently for two hours. Serve 
it with arrow-root, or custard sauce. 

PURIM FRITTERS 

Take a loaf of baker's bread, cut off the crust and cut in slices 
of one half inch thick ; put them in a dish and soak them in cold 
milk, but not so long as to allow them to mash ; when soaked, 
take them out and drain them. Beat eight eggs very thick, and 
pour a little of the egg over each slice of bread, so as to penetrate 
them ; then take each slice of bread and dip it into the eggs that 
are beaten, and fry a light brown color, in rendered butter, from 
which the salt has been extracted ; when this is done sprinkle 
over the fritters a little powdered cinnamon, and serve with a 
syrup made of white sugar. 

CODFISH FRITTERS. 

Take two pounds of salt codfish, put t^ soak in water ; when 
fresh enough, boil and drain ; pick out the bones, and pound the 
fish fine in a mortar; to this add chopped parsley, pepper, a little 
nutmeg, and a table -apoon of butter. Take three or four onions, 
chop fine and fry them in butter ; scald and peel two tomatoes, 
and let them simmer with the onions ; mix this with the fish 
thoroughly, add six eggs well beaten, and fry in small fritters a 
light brown color. 



JEWISH RECEIPTS. 321 



LEMON PUDDINGS. 



To be added to four eggs, well-beaten, one fourth pound of loaf 
sugar and two ounces of butter which have been previously well 
mixed together, then the peel of two lemons and the juice of one, 
and bake either in cups or pie dish. 

A RICHER LEMON PUDDING. — 1. 

Six yolks and two whites of eggs to be well-beaten, and then 
added to three ounces of butter and one fourth of sugar, the juice 
of one lemon and the rind of two, which must be taken by rubbing 
a lump or two of loaf sugar upon it. 

LEMON PUDDING. — 2. 

One fourth pound of fine boiled bread crumbs added to the 
above, and a little more sugar to taste, and boil in a form. 

APPLE PUDDING. 

Grate one half pound of apples, mix with four eggs well-beaten, 
and six ounces of sugar, and bake in a form and turn out. 

ALBERT SANDWICHES. 

Take one half pound of butter, melt it to an oil before the fire, 
add one half pound light weight of flour, and one half of pounded 
loaf sugar ; mix well together, add six eggs wdl heateuy and then 
beat all well together, either flavor with a few pounded almonds or 
the rind of lemon rubbed on sugar ; put this mixture on well but- 
tered tins about a third of an inch thick, and bake in a quick oven ; 
it must be taken out when it is a very pale color, and loosened 
whilst it is hot, from the tin, the edges always get too dark, but they 
are cut off. When nearly baked, sprinkle pink sugar over half the 
quantity. When cold cut in diamonds and put sweatmeats be- 
tween, like sandwiches ; arrange them nicely in the dish and 
put whipped cream, flavored with vanilla, and the least bit of su- 
gar, in the middle. The vanilla is best grated. Perhaps you will 
find it easier to put the mixture on buttered papers laid in tins. 

MERINGUES. 

Take the whites of eight eggs quite fresh and just broken, beat 



322 JEWISH RECEIPTS. 

them with a whisk till as firm as possible. Have ready prepared 
eight table spoons of ground not powdered sugar, which mix with 
the Qgg as quickly as possible, so as not to give time to melt. Have 
ready a piece of board and sixteen pieces of white paper ; put a 
tablespoon of the mixture on each paper in the shape of an egg ; 
make it thick but not too spread out, smooth them off nicely, and 
sprinkle with sugar, blow off what sugar falls on the paper j and 
then put board and all into the oven ; watch them well and take them 
out as soon as firm. Have ready another piece of board with clean 
papers, roll off the meringues on to them, making them stand on 
their tops ; take out a little of the inside with a tea-spoon, and put 
them back in the oven or the hoard for the inside to get firm, fill 
with whipped cream flavored with vanilla and some sugar, and 
join the two halves together to form an egg. 

The papers must neither be buttered or have sugar on them, and 
they must not be baked without boards. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 

When you make a bread and butter pudding, put only the yolks 
inside, and whip the whites ; sweeten and flavor, and when the 
pudding is baked, put this on the top, and put it in the oven again 
for a few minutes, to crisp, and you will find it a great improv- 
ment. 

SALLY LUNN 

Three table-spoons butter, two table-spoonsful sugar, two cups 
milk, scant four cups flour, five eggs, one tea-spoon soda, two tea- 
spoons cream of tartar. Bake twenty-five minutes. Eat hot, 
spread with butter. 

ANOTHER METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS. 

One pint of flour, piece of butter half as large as an egg^ one 
egg, two table-spoonsful sugar, one tea-cup milk, one tea-spoonful 
cream of tartar, one half tea-spoonful soda, one tea-spoon salt. 
Bake twenty minutes. 

CUP CAKE. 

One cup of butter, two sugar, three cups flour, five eggs, one 



JEWISH RECEIPTS. 323 

teaspoon soda, dissolved in tea-cup of milk. Two tea-spoonsful 
cream tartar, flavor to fancy. 

HICKORY NUT CAKE. 

Three cups flour, two cups sugar, two eggs, one half cup but- 
ter, one pint hickory nuts, one half cup milk, one half tea-spoon 
soda. 

MARMALADE. 

Twenty-four yolks of eggs, one half pound white sugar, clarify, 
boil, and strain ; add one table-spoonful beaten sweet almonds to 
the syrup, while boiling. When the syrup cools, pour the eggs, 
which must be well beaten, with a spoon gently. Keep stirring 
on a gentle fire, till it becomes thick. 

ORGENT. 

Two pounds sugar ; clarify and make thick, three ounces sweet 
almonds, one ounce bitter almonds, well beaten fine, one quart 
water to the almonds, stir up well, and then squeeze ; add them 
to the syrup, and boil ; when cold add orange flower and rose 
water according to taste. 

COCOA NUT PUDDING. 

One pound of ground cocoa nut, one pound of crushed sugar 
made into a syrup, one half pint water, six eggs. 

Throw the cocoa nut in the syrup, when boiling, and let it cook 
say ten minutes, stirring it occasionally to keep from burning ; when 
perfectly cold throw in your eggs, and beat them well in, then 
bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. 

CUP CAKE. 

One cup butter, two cups sugar, five cups flour, one nutmeg, four 
eggs, a little saleratus 

SWEET CRACKERS. 

One pint flour, three fourths cup sugar, two spoonsful of cinna- 
mon, one fourth pound butter, a little salt. 

Roll very thin ; bake quick ; mix all up in a dough with sweet 
milk. 



324 JEWISH RECEIPTS. 



ALMOND PUDDING. 

Pound together half a pound of sweet almonds and six or seven 
bitter almonds, mix with half a pound of sifted sugar, a little fine 
orange flower water, and the yolks of ten and the Avhites of seven 
Avell-whisked eggs. Mix thoroughly, and bake in a quick oven half 
an hour, or until it is sufficently firm to turn out of the dish ; sift 
sugar thickly over it or pour round it a rich syrup flavored with 
orenge flower water ; serve hot or cold. 

LEMON DUMPLINGS. 

Three fourths pounds of flour, one half pound moist sugar, the 
juice of two lemons, the grated rind of one, one half pound of 
chopped suet, all well mixed together with very little water ; make 
with it six dumplings. To boil without ceasing, for one hour, and 
be eaten as soon as served with melted butter, well sweetened, 
and the rind of one lemon in it, or any other sweet sauce will do. 

LIGHT PUDDING. 

Beat five yolks with sugar to suit, add two tea-spoons very full 
of flour, the juice and grated rind of one lemon ; lastly add the 
five whites beaten well to frost, and bake immediately ; it takes 
about half an hour to cook; grease the dish, serve a sauce 
with it if liked. 

TOMATOES FOR WINTER USE. 

See that your tomatoes are quite fresh, else they will break 
the bottles when they ferment. Pour scalding water over them, 
and take off the skins. It is usual to remove all the green parts, 
though some housekeepers think it is not necessary. Put them 
over the fire in a tin, or china lined saucepan, and let them boil 
half an hour. Have your cans ready, fill them full, and screw 
them tight ; they require no seasoning till you are ready to use 
them. Then add pepper, salt, thyme, sweet marjoram and onion. 
Too much seasoning spoils the taste of the tomato, but a little of 
these herbs is an addition ; also add grated bread crumbs and but- 
ter ; they are much improved by putting them in a deep dish ; 
season as above, and spread thin slices of bread and butter, or 



4 JEWISH RECEIPTS. 325 

grate the bread, and add the butter ; put them in the oven and bake 
till brown. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERS 

Put them in a wooden or stone vessel, pour over strong salt and 
water boiling hot, put a weight on to keep them under the pickle. 
After three days pour it off, boil and turn it over them again ; 
stand three days again ; then take them out and let them lie one 
night in plain cold water ; next day put them over the fire, but do 
not let them boil, allowing one table-spoonful of alum t« a gallon 
of vinegar; mace, cinnamon, peppercorns, white and black, mus- 
tard seed and grated horseradish. One table-spoonful of each to 
every gallon of vinegar, and one tea-spoonful of tumeric. Fold 
a double piece of linen and a soft thick brown paper, and tie the 
jars tight ; throw in the vinegar, keep in a dry place. A bladder 
and linen cloth are nice to be over the pots.
