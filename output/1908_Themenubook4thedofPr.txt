Lemco 

and the Chafing Dish 



Absolutely essential to success in 
Chafing-Dish Cookery, is Lemco. 
All culinary authorities are agreed 
on ,tbis. 

Prime beef stock always ready, 
pure and fresh, Lemco enables 
dainty little dishes to be readily 
prepared, which, without it, would 
be iinpossible or troublesome. 
No added flavour to Lemco, it 
is just pure concentrated beef 
essence which cannot be told 
from fresh beef stock in savoury, 
curry, or ragout.

PREFACE. 



The ever-growing necessity for variety in our menus 
'mgels us to glean new ideas and fresh help from every 
•^ssible source. 

Vhe object, therefore, of this culinary handbook is in 
the'Bj-st place to assist caterers, restaurateurs, managers, 
maltres d'h6tel, chefs, stewards, head waiters, and house- 
keepers to plan and compile menus of every kind of meal 
with greater ease, and to enable them to have at their 
disposal a k -ge and constant variety of seasonable and 
suitable dishes. 

Every course, from hors-d'oeuvre to dessert, has been 
exhaustively treated ; and the work • is compiled so as 
to give at a glance an almost infinite variety of every 
possible kind of dish that can be introduced into a menu. 

In most cases the - requisite mode of cooking, the 
garniture and style of dressing or dishing up, is briefly 
described. The book should not, however, be confused 
with a book of recipes, for its raison d'Ure is to enable 
1;libse who can cook or superintend cooking to draft 
menus with greater ease, and to give each dish its proper 
French name. 

The adoption of French names in menus has become 
fashionable because most of the typical French dishes 
have become fully naturalised in the kitchens and on 
the tables of this country. It therefore becomes the 
duty of all persons interested in culinary matters to 
know how to describe them in correct French. 

The author can hardly expect that this book will 
bring about a revolution in the customs of gastroilomy, 
but he does hope that its use wUl be the meians of intro- 
ducing greater variety into the daily menus, and, if 
possible, economy in the preparation of dishes. ' Hence 
its mission should, if for no other purpose, prove practical 
and useful to such who .avoid ordinary cookery books 
and fight shy of scientific culinary treatises. If such 
an aim is achieved the author's efforts will be amply 
rewarded. 

The present, enlarged] edition contaiiis a special chapter 
on the Art of Menu Compilation, as well as over 2,000 
additional dishes.

THE MENU. 

♦ 

THE ORIGIN OF MENUS. 

Menu is a French word, denoting minute details as 
applied to kitchen bill, bill of fare, table card, or pro- 
gramme of a meal, its object being^to present a list of 
dishes and courses, eatables, and beverages. ' 

Although the kitchen bill of fare is probably as old as 
the art of cooking, our forefathers in past ages had- no 
use or need for menus ; they contented themselves with 
merely looking at the dishes to judge the nature of the 
viands as they were brought to table. 

Ancient Rome, and all her glories, according to history, 
had enormous feasts and expensive banquets. Untold 
wealth was lavished on foods and drinks, and its 
culinary triumphs were incomparable to our modern 
gastronomic feasts, yet no mention is made of a menu 
or bill of fare being in use in those days. 

The use of menus was first heard of as being adopted - 
for table use in 1541, when, at a banquet given by the 
Duke Henry- of Brunswick, his Grace was seen to have 
a sheet of paper by the side of his plate, to which he 
occasionally referred. One of the duke's guests asked 
what the paper was for, and on its being explained that 
it was a sort of programme of what they were going to 
eat, and by looking through it he could reserve his appe- 
tite for those dishes he liked best, the idea was so much 
admired that it soon became generally known and 
adopted. The old-fashioned bills of fare were usually 
written on large cards gaudily ornamented with gastro- 
nomic symbols, etc. ; they were, however, of such a size 
that only one copy could be conveniently placed at each 
end of the table. 

Another version is that Count Hugo de Montfort, at 
a dinner given in the year- 1498, was noticed to have a 
piece of written parchment near his plate, which he 
frequently consulted, and when asked what it was he 



10 THE MENU BOOK. 

explained that he had ordered the head cook to write 
on it the various dishes that were being sent from the 
kitchen. 

The size of these parchments and paper lists gradually 
diminished, and, as they became smaller, larger numbers 
were placed at the table, until the present form of menu 
was generally introduced, when each guest is provided 
with a written or printed menu card. 

Modern Menus. 

Modern menus, as a rule, are much more prettily got 
up than those of olden times. In the matter of material 
for menus, white paper is mostly used, but more expensive 
material is also employed. I have seen some made of 
silk, papier-mache ; some in the form of shells, books, 
almanacks, cigars, cigarettes, matchboxes, newspapers, 
maps, post-cards, bank-notes, blank covers, envelopes, 
etc. Menus in the shape of envelopes are particularly 
pretty, and now very much in favour. One takes the 
form of a small, deUcately-coloured envelope of thin 
cardboard, decorated with gold ; the flap is engraved 
with a motto, crest, name of host or hostess, some flowers, 
or a knife and fork crossed, and a sprig of herbs; the 
post-mark is " Bon App6tit." On the address side is 
a stamp in gold, with some gastronomic design, and a 
post-mark bearing the name of the place where the meal 
is given, with the respective date and name of the diner. 
The enclosure is, of course, the menu itself. 

Hand-painted menus on paper, parchment, and satin 
are in great favour in all society circles. Some of the 
newest have a miniature of the host or hostess painted 
in the centre, and are occasionally the work of noted 
artists. 

In England, America, and France much art and 
luxury have been lavished on menu cards. Parchment 
of the Middle Ages competes with Japanese rice-paper. 
Some menus, with their seals and ribbons, are like a 
charter of nobility, whilst others are in the form of 
beautiful miniature fans. 

For some time there has been a reaction against extra- 
vagant luxury, which is being replaced by a simpUcitj- 
not less excessive. Sometimes the names of the dishes 
are written by hand on thick paper, without any orna- 
mentation. As usual, the best kind are between these 



MODERN. MENUS. ii 

excesses of ostentation and severity. Menus of out-of- 
the-way and awkward shapes are at all times to be 
avoided, because they encumber the table, and are 
difficult to consult.

A TYPICAL FRENCH DINNER MENU. 

Without microscopical print, they should be suffi- 
ciently small to be readable without much difficulty, 
and not add to the embarrassment caused by a succession 
of glasses and other articles on the table. The menu 
card is a simple accessory, and should be treated as such. 
This rule ought to be taken into consideration when 
ordering the menu cards. 



12 THE MENU BOOK. 

The Art of Compiling Menus. 

To be able to compose or construct a menu is an art 
learnt only by experience ; it is by no means as easy 
as some people imagine. 

But few of the guests partaking of an elaborately 
prepared banquet have any idea of the amount of skill 
that is devoted to the composition of the menu, selecting 
choice provisions, and planning the dishes so that all 
have the desired harmonising effect which bring about 
the gastronomic success of the banquet. It is, of course, 
comparatively easy to make out a menu for a luncheon 
or a small dinner consisting merely of soup, fish, joint, 
vegetable, and a sweet— for such presents no difficulty 
to the average cook or housekeeper. 

But when it comes to arranging a first-class and well- 
planned dinner of recherche character, it is quite a 
different matter, for then every course, from the hors- 
d'ceuvre to the entremets, present more or less difficulties, 
especially tg. J^ose inexperienced in the art of menu 
composition. There are many hard-and-fast rules in the 
gasfi-onomic laws which must be observed if one is to 
attain success, for a badly-composed menu is likely to 
spoil the best dinner. That great gastronomic and 
culinary artist, Brillat-Savarin, truly said : " Menu nial 
fait, diner perdu." 

To be able to plan or compile a recherche luncheon, 
dinner or supper, is regarded as a high accomplishment, 
for, as already stated, much of the success of a. repast 
depends upon its menu. 

The arrangement of an elaborate dinner is an art in 
itself, and consists in selecting the various courses so 
that the dishes harmonise with each other ; the chief 
requirements being that : — 

1. Each dish shall be different in composition and 
inode of cooking. 

2. The composition of the individual dishes must be 
excellent ; while they should be well cooked, tastefully 
dressed, and yet distinct in character. 

3. The harmonising effect is obtained by so arranging 
the dishes that each one is distinct from the other, bearing 
no relation in appearance to the preceding or following 
dishes. 

4. A judicious selection of the raw materials, having 



THE ART OF COMPILING MENUS. 13 

regard to the season of the year, must be made in all 
cases, else the menu of a meal may easily be marred.

14 THE MENU BOOK. 

5. The various meats and other more important 
materials forming one course must not be repeated in 
the same menu from one course to another. 

6. The various kinds of sauces employed in the pre- 
parations, and serving as accompaniments to the dishes, 
must each be distinctly different in colour, taste, and 
flavour. 

It is well to remember that tne true estimate of the 
value of a menu as a literary composition is not always 
obtained by observing the attention given to it by the 
guest at a dinner table, for at such a time the average 
diner is engaged in concentrating his whole mind on a 
rapid analysis of the good things present and to come. 
It is often later, in some leisured moment, that the menu 
is read with a critical eye, and if found the least worthy 
from a literary point of view, is treasured as an interesting 
souvenir of a memorable occasion. 

Menus are planned for every meal, breakfast, luncheon, 
dinner, and supper, but of all these the dinner menu is 
of the greatest importance, and the most difficult. 

For special occasions, such as ball suppers, dinner or 
luncheon parties, etc., the menu is usually prepared a 
day or more in advance, so that the needful provisions 
may be purchased and other necessary arrangements 
made, thus allowing ample leisure to get everything 
ready in good time, and avoiding much confusion when 
the moment for cooking and serving arrives. 

The menu, it is hardly necessary to say, must in all 
cases be strictly followed. 

Selection of Dishes. 

In compiling a menu it is necessary to study the variety 
of dishes, and their selection, for each dish should vary- 
both in colour and taste from those served before or after. 
The character of dishes must be retained throughout ; 
sauces (except sauces served with fish) should correspond 
in taste and colour with the viands with which they 
are intended to be served. If two soups appear on a 
menu, one ought to be clear and the other thick ; should 
the thick soup be a pur6e of vegetables, the clear 
soup must contain no vegetable roots as garnishing. 

When two or more fish are to be served, the first, as 
a rule, is boiled, and generally a large fish, such as turbot, 
salmon, cod, etc. ; the next one would be a small fish. 



NAMING THE DISHES. 15 

either fried or broiled. Whitebait are often served as a 
third dish. 

The entrfees should always be so classified that light 
dishes, such as rissoles, bouchees, croquettes, quenelles, 
kromeskis, etc., are served first, 

If there are two removes, poultry is served before the 
butcher's meat. 

The cardinal point is to have all dressed removes 
served before the plain roasted ones. 

What is called the second service on a menu includes 
the roast, the savoury, and the sweet entremets, the 
dessert, and cheese. When two or more sweets are 
served, the first one should be hot and the other cold. 

If fancy savouries are given, they come in after the 
sweets, for they are intended to prepare the palate for 
the choice wines which usually follow a good dinner. 

Naming the Dishes. 

In preparing a bill of fare for a large dinner, it is advis- 
a)3le to avoid such dishes as are difficult to dress when 
done in a great number, for they will cause complication 
and needless confusion in the kitchen, and often lead to 
disorganised service. It is also most unwise to use 
new names of dishes which are not known, or which 
may be known under a different title, for they will only 
puzzle the diner, who might not know the standard 
names of old dishes. Avoid also the use of pompous 
names of dishes, especially when inexpensive in character, 
for they often lead to confusion and disappointment. 
The names of high-standing personalities, towns, 
countries, etc., are applied in connection with many 
dishes ; the French cuisine especially has the names 
given to dishes in honour of men who gained their 
celebrity either by their talent as diplomats, states- 
men, soldiers, artists, or such as have distinguished 
themselves by their gastronomic or epicurean merits. 
Hence we have such names in connection with certp,in 
dishes as LucuUus, Savarin, Louis XV., Soubise, 
Richelieu, Cardme, Maintenon, Cond6, Colbert, .Villeroy, 
Talleyrand, Nesselrode, Demidoff, Marie-LOuise, Montglas. 
Victoria, etc. 

These names, as well as very many others registered, in 
this book, are associated with various culinary preparations, 
and are recognised by cooks of all nations. 



1 6 THE MENU BOOK. 

There are, unfortunately, some cooks in the habit of 
altering the genuine names of dishes, to which they 
apply some other high-sounding names, in order to 
make themselves famous, but they only succeed in 
making themselves look ridiculous in the eyes of a 
real gourmet, who is not likely to be thus deceived. 
If, however, the composition of a certain dish is due 
to the talent and initiative of a cook, then the case 
is different, and he or she will have a perfect right 
to name such a dish according to his fancy. 

The foregoing remarks show that the composition of 
a menu may mar or make the success of a dinner. 
Defectively composed menus can often compromise the 
reputation of a good chef. Although the menu may be 
of little use to some people, it is indispensable to con- 
noisseurs who understand the language of the kitchen, 
for they will be able to judge the kind of dinner on 
analysing the menu, and by so doing be able to give 
their verdict as to the capacity of the chef, according to 
the arrangement of the dishes and the combination of 
the viands. 

WHEN FOOD IS IN SEASON. 

Arr.\nged i^ Alphabeticai, Order. 

The following is a table showing the period when the 
principal foods are in prime condition and best obtainable 
m the markets. 

When marketing it is well to remember that the food 
most seasonable is usually that which is most plentiful, 
most wholesome, and as a rule the most reasonable in 
price. It is well to remember that a number of the 
articles named can be had at almost any time of the 
year, though not, strictly speaking, in season.

SPELLINQ AND PRONUNCIATION OF 
PRINCIPAL WORDS USED IN FRENCH MENUS. 

Tlie custom of writing menus for lunclieons, dinners 
or suppers is one of long standing, not only in this country, 
but in all parts of the civilised world, although there are 
many people who regard it with a certain amount of 
prejudice. Those who go abroad or frequent first-class 
hotels, clubs, and restaurants, are familiarised with the 
langue de cuisine ; but the occasional diner is frequently 
at a loss to understand not only the terms and phrases 
used in the compilation of the menu, but also their 
correct pronunciation. It is a recognised fact that we 
owe much of the advancement and development of 
cookery to the French, who excel in the culinary art ; 
and with the introduction of Special dishes and processes 
of food preparation, we have also to a certain extent 
become acquainted with many of the ordinary culinary 
terms used in the French fawgwoge, which, as far as menus 
are concerned, has -become the fashion, notwithstanding 
the inconvenience which the average Englishman feels 
in consequence, tt is, however, a matter of difficulty to 
give the correct rendering of the phonetic pronunciation 
of French words, on account of there being in English no 
equivalents in many instances for the sounds in French. 

The accents must receive especial attention in writing 
or reading menus, as the meaning of a word may be 
completely changed by its use or omission. At the 
same time, it must be observed that there is, in general, 
no especial stress of voice on any one syllable in French, 
even when an accent is placed over a letter in that 
syllable. The accent determines the sound or pronun- 
ciation of the letter alone. 

The following suggestions and explanations having 
reference to the various courses comprising a luncheon 
or dinner menu may prove helpful, not only in the 
compilation of the latter, but also as an aid to the correct 
interpretation and pronunciation * of the phraseology 
generally in vogue. 

* It ,is, however, impossible to give exact equivalents to the French «, 
the e in many instances, the ot, and the om. Our phonetic rendering is 
approximate only. -

LUNCHEON AND LUNCH MENUS. 

Menus des Dejeuners "a la Fourchette. 

The French have two kinds of dejeuners : one is called 
" d la Tasse," being a plain breakfast, and the other 
" d la fourchette," which is equivalent to an English 
luncheon. 

The word " lunch," or " luncheon," is said to be derived 
from the Welsh llwne, which is a derivation of lump. 
In bygone days lunch or luncheon meant simply a lump 
of bread and cheese taken between meals, " a frugal 
bit " ; but now the lunch, more especially among the 
upper classes, has become a fashionable meal, and one 
quite as important as the dinner of former times. Few 
meals offer better opportunities for combining smart 
little dishes at comparatively small expense than the 
lunch or luncheon. There are plenty of dainty dishes which 
can be prepared with little trouble, suitable as luncheon 
dishes, that can with advantage be brought within the 
scope of high-class cookery. The menus given below 
show what kinds of dishes are suitable for such repasts.

30 THE MENU BOOK. 

DINNER— LE DINER. 

The word " dinner " {diner, f.)is supposed to be a corrup- 
tion of dix heures, indicating the hour at which in the days 
of Norman rule this meal was taken. In a book published 
in 1 5 12, entitled the Household Book, it is stated that 
the family rose at six, breakfasted at seven, dined at ten, 
supped at four, and closed the gates at nine p.m. 

Dinner with all classes forms the principal meal of the 
day. The working and middle classes take it at mid-day, 
whilst the better classes and fashionable society partake 
of it between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The aristocracy have 
always dined later in the day than the other classes. 

The number of courses of a dinner depends on the 
circumstances of the host and hostess, but the courses 
have increased with time and fashion, whilst the number 
of dishes served have decreased ; that is to say, instead 
of serving two soups, two or three fish, and as many 
entries, not more than one, or at the most two, are now 
placed on modern menus. 

One must not overlook the fact that the greater the 
variety of dishes introduced in a menu, the greater must 
be the waste. 

The present tendency is for shorter meads — that is, 
fewer dishes than formerly ; but the maxim is, " Let there 
be choice of excellent quality, well-cooked, and daintily 
served." 

The gastronomic world of this country owes a debt of 
gratitude to H.M. King Edward as regards dinners, for 
he has expressed a wish that aX the houses where he 
dines dinners should be quickly served, and never last 
more than an hour. Hence short dinners have now 
become the rule as well as the fashion. 

This has a great significance, for the all-important 
fact that the dishes selected for a recherche dinner shall

SUPPER AND SUPPER MENUS. 
Souper et Menus de Soupers. 

This is the term for the last meal of the day, and one 
which has a wide and varied meaning. During the 
Middle Ages supper used to be served as early as 5 p.m., 
when it was customarj' to serve soup ; from this the name 
supper is supposed to have originated. History tells us 
that soups, or supper dishes, originally consisted of liquid 
food both savoury and sweet, such as frumenty, porridge, 
and various kinds of spoon meat, which were eaten with 
pieces of bread called sops, soppets or sippets. 

Where late dinner is served, as is usually the case at 
the present time, supper is rarely eateUr 

So-called ball suppers and theatre suppers are fashion- 
able both here and abroad. There is no set rule as to 
the kind of dishes served for supper, but when partaken 
of as an every-day meal supper may consist of dishes hot 
or cold, with or without soups, vegetables or even sweets. 

Cheese and salad when in season are usually included, 
but this is not to be regarded as a hard-and-fast rule 
Light cakes and fancy gateaux, tea or coffee, are some- 
times included in a supper menu, which shows that many 
regard this meal as but a light repast. 

The foUomng menus are selected as specimens for 
so-termed set suppers :

58 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY. 

PART II. 

HORS-D'CEUVRE— APPETISERS. 

The hors-d'oeuvre course, which forms the so-called 
prelude to a complete dinner, has of late become very 
popular. 

A very large variety of 'little dishes, both plain and 
dressed, can be served under this heading. These dishes 
to the thoughtful cook present one of the best opportunities 
for showing his or her skill and originality in combination 
and garnish. Such dishes must, however, be strictly 
confined to such colour and such material as will harmonise 
with the other dishes on the menu. 

, Usually one or two plain and one dressed hors-d'oeuvre 
are served at a dinner, this being a matter of taste left 
to the maitre d'hotel or to the chef. 

Whatever the hors-d'oeuvre may consist of, let it be 
remembered that these little side dishes are intended to 
stimulate and not satisfy the appetite, i.e., they must be 
tempting and smart in appearance, and the portions must 
be very small, so as not to impair the enjoyment of the 
remainder of the meal. 

These dishes are frequently placed on the table before 
the guests enter the dining-room ; and, when dressed in 
a pretty and dainty manner, they add greatly to the 
effective decoration of a table.

68 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMV. 

PART III, 

POTAQES— SOUPS. 

Next to hors-d'ceuvre, Soup forms the best introduction 
to a meal ; it is, as far as the dinner is concerned, an 
indispensable course, and therefore important. Soups arc 
divided into four groups : Broths, Consommes, clear soups 
with garnish ; purees of meat, poultry or game ; bisques 
and fish soups ; and creams, or filtered soups made from 
vegetables and farinaceous products. Sometimes the 
choice of two or three varieties of soups are given at one 
meal, in which case the clear soup, or consomme, must be 
placed on the menu before the thick soups. Tlie present 
fashion is in favour of one soup only, either clear or 
thick. For a full-course dinner, or one of many courses, 
a clear or light thick soup, cream or bisque, gives more 
satisfaction than a heavy soup, because it conduces better 
to the appreciation of the succeeding dishes. Heavy or 
thick soups are generally considered more seasonable in 
winter than in summer. 

There are certain more or less flexible rules observed 
in serving consomme : cheese straws, or grisini, fingers, 
toasted bread and grated parmesan cheese are generally 
handed round with it. Sherry is served with turtle soup ; 
fried bread croutons with purees ; and celery salt with 
vegetable and cream soups. With mulligatawny, both 
thick and clear, a small dish of plain boiled rice is handed 
round, unless included in the soup as garnish.

PART IV. 

THE FISH COURSE. 

LES POISSONS. 

Fish is served in two ways, viz., plainly cooked and 
dressed as an entree. Many people prefer fish cooked 
in the simplest way, accompanied by a good sauce ; and 
the English epicure finds far greater enjoyment in fish 
cooked in the simplest manner than the French epicure 
in the elaborately cooked and dressed fish entree. Fish 
is cooked in various ways — boiled, steamed, baked, fried, 
stewed, and grilled. Almost every kind of fish gains in 
importance' if served with a well-made sauce. 

When two fish are served at a dinner, the boiled or 
whole — i.e., solid — fish should be served before the fried, 
stewed or braised. 

Plain boiled potatoes or so-called fish potatoes, which 
are of marble shapes, sprinkled with chopped parsley, 
should be handed round with all solid fish cooked au 
naturel, whilst boiled or grilled salmon should in all 
cases be accompanied by a dish of sliced cucumber, 
plainly dressed.

PART V. 

SAUCES. 



The importance of sauce in cookery is so well known that 
I need not offer any excuse for including the definitions 
of all the standard sauces and the most popular of other 
liquid seasonings in this book. 

In almost every instance some kind of sauce is named 
along with, or as an ingredient in, the preparation of dishes. 
Again, the blending of two or more sauces is frequently 
recommended, so that we have given the names of these.

PART VII. 



THE ENTREE COURSE. 

Dishes following the fish course or preceding the 
Remove when such is served, are called entrees ; which, 
being translated into English, means " entrance." Hence 
the dishes served under this heading are considered by 
the epicure as the first "of the essential dishes of a correct 
dinner, and rightly so, because there may be dinners 
without hors-d'oeuvre, and even without soup, or without 
a remove or releve, but there can be no proper dinner 
without an entree course. 

Entrees are generally defined as " dressed dishes," or 
" made dishes." A dish bearing the name " entree " is, 
as a general rule, composed of more than one ingredient, 
and there should always be a distinction from roast or 
boiled meat served with a vegetable or other garnish and 
an entree. 

When two entries are chosen in a dinner, the first 
should be the lighter of the two. All entries should be 
made in fancy style, so as to avoid carving ; for entries 



THE ENTREE COURSE. 145 

snould not be carved or served from the sideboard. 
During Lent (mi-cargme) dishes known as fish entrees, 
excepting in the case of cold dishes, are allowable as 
entrees. 

The great secret in entrees in general lies undoubtedly 
in the sauces used for their preparation or their accom- 
paniment. All sauces should serve the purpose of liquid 
seasonings, and as such they must be rich and carefully 
prepared. 

Compound or long process sauces, foundation sauces 
and their offsprings, play a most important part in the 
entrees themselves, as well as in their relation to the 
dishes which precede and follow them ; their character, 
flavour, and colour must, of course, be studied so as to 
harmonise with the rest of the dishes selected for the same 
meal, more particularly so in the case of Dinner Entrees. 

Special Light Entries, including several
