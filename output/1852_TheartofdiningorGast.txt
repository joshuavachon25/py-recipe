PREFATORY NOTICK 



The groundwork of this little book is taken from two 
articles in the Quarterly Review, by the same writer ; 
the first of which, entitled G-astronomy and G-astro- 
nomers, appeared in July, 1835, and the second, 
being a review of the late Mr. Walker's Original, 
in February, 1836. The following pages are an 
attempt to consolidate those articles, and to bring 
down and adapt to the present time the disquisitions, 
descriptions, and directions contained in them. 

Among the many distinguished and accom- 
plished persons who have kindly fallen in with the 
humour of the undertaking, and have supplied the 
writer with valuable materials in the shape of hints, 
recipes, and illustrative anecdotes, he deems it 
an imperative duty to acknowledge his obligations 
to Count d'Orsay, Lord Marcus Hill, the Eight 
Hon. Colonel Damer, the Hon. W. Stuart (attached 
to the British Embassy at Paris), Sir Alexander 
Grant, Bart., Sir H. Hume Campbell, of March- 
mont, Bart., the Editor of the Quarterly Eeview, the 
Author of the Spanish Handbook, Lady Morgan, and 
(last, not least) the author of * Stuart of Dunleith.'

THE ART OF DINING. 



«M^N^^«^^lA^^NA^^^^^^^^^^^S/\^^l^^/^^^^^^>iA* 



M- Henrion de Pensey, late President of the Coiirt 
of Cassation, the magistrate (according to M. Eoyer 
CoUard) of whom *' regenerated " France had most 
zeason to be proud, expressed himself as follows to 
MM. Laplace, Ghaptal, and BerthoUet, three of the 
most distinguished men of science of their day : — " I 
xegard the discovery of a dish as a far more interest- 
ing event than the discovery of a star, for we have 
always stars enough, but we can never have too many 
dishes ; and I shall not regard the sciences as suffi- 
)ciently honoured or adequately represented amongst 
Ufi, until I see a cook in the first class of the In- 
Btitute." Most rational and candid persons will 
coincide with the judge, to the extent of think- 
ing that mankind are deeply interested in the 
due cultivation of the art which improves health, 
prolongs life, and promotes kindly feelings, besides 
largely contributing to a class of material enjoy- 
ments which are only reprehensible whem tinged by 
coarseness or excess. The history of gastronomy is 
that of maimers, if not of morals ; and the learned are 
aware that its literature is both instructive and amus- 
ing; for it is replete with curious traits of character 



THE ART OF DINING. 



and comparative views of society at different periods,- 
as well as with striking anecdotes of remarkable men 
and women, whose destinies have been strangely- 
influenced by their epicurean tastes and habits. Let 
it, moreover, be remembered, that a tone of mock 
seriousness or careless gaiety does not necessarily 
imply the absence of sound reflection. The laughing 
philosopher may prove better worth attention than 
the solemn pedant ; and the thoughtful reader of the 
following pages may learn &om them, not merely 
how and where to dine best, but by what means, and 
upon what principles, convivial intercourse has been 
carried to the highest pitch of refinement in circles 
like those described by the poet : — 

** When in retreat Fox lays his thunder by. 
And Wit and Taste their mingled charms supply, 
When Siddons, bom to melt and freeze the heait, 
Performs at home her more endearing part." 

As regards the historical parts of our lucubrations, 
we shall be exceedingly brief, and not at all learned — 
bestowing only a passing glance on the ancients, and 
hurrying on as fast as possible to France and England. 

It is sagaciously remarked by Madame Dacier, that 
Homer makes ik) mention of boiled meat in any of 
his works ; and in all the entertainments described 
by him, m in the dinner given by Achilles to the 
royal messengers in the ninth Iliad, the piece de r^- 
sistance undoubtedly is a broil ; from which it is 
plausibly inferred that the Greeks had not then dis- 
covered the mode of making vessels to bear fire. 
This discovery is supposed to have reached them

from Egypt, and they rapidly turned it to the best 
possible account. The Athenians, in particular, 
seem to have as much excelled the rest of Greece in 
gastronomy, as the French, the modem nation most 
nearly resembling them, excel the rest of Europe in 
this respect. The best proof of this assertion is to 
be found in the circumstance that the learned have 
agreed to rank amongst the most valuable of the lost 
works of antiitjuity, a didactic poem on gastronomy, 
by Archestratus, the intimate friend of one of the 
sons of Pericles. " This great writer," says Athe- 
naeus, " had traversed earth and sea to render him- 
self acquainted with the best things which they 
produced. He did not, during his travels, inquire 
concerning the manners of nations, as to which it is 
useless to inform ourselves, since it is impossible to 
change them ; but he entered the laboratories where 
the delicacies of the table were prepared, and he held 
intercourse with none but those who could advance 
his pleasures. His poem is a treasure of science, 
every verse a precept.** 

These terms of exalted praise mufet be taken with 
a few grains of salt, for, considering the imperfect 
state of the physical sciences at the time, it may well 
be doubted whether Archestratus succeeded in pro- 
ducing so complete a treasure of precepts as his ad- 
mirers have supposed. Another groimd of scepti- 
cism is supplied by the accounts that have come 
down to us of the man himself, who is said to have 
been so small and lean, that, when placed in the 
scales, his weight was found not to exceed 'Sixi^'^^^sf^^co&N

in which case he must have borne a strong resem- 
blance to the Dutch governor mentioned in Knicker- 
bocker's History of New York, who pined away so 
imperceptibly, that when he died there was nothing 
of him left to bury. Besides, it is highly probable 
that all which was really valuable in the cookery of the 
Greeks was carried off, along with the other arts to 
which ordinary opinion assigns a yet higher value, 
to Eome. As, indeed, we know that the Romans 
sent a deputation to Athens for the laws of Solon, 
and were in the constant habit of repairing thither 
to study in the schools, it would be ludicrous to 
suppose that they neglected the cuisine ; and there 
can be little or no doubt whatever, that when, at a 
somewhat later period, the Grecian philosophers, 
poets, and rhetoricians flocked to Rome as the metro- 
polis of civilization, the cooks of Athens accompanied 
them. Yet concentrating, as the Roman banquets 
must have done, all the gastronomic genius and 
resources of the world, they were much more remark- 
able for profusion and costliness than for taste. The 
sole merit of a dish composed of the brains of five hun- 
dred peacocks or the tongues of five hundred nightin- 
gales, must have been its deamess ; and if a mode of 
swallowing most money in a given time be the desi- 
deratum, commend us to Cleopatra's decoction of 
pearls — although even this was fairly exceeded in 
originality and neatness of conception by the frail 
fair one — the famous Mrs. Sawbridge, we believe — 
who, to show her contempt for an elderly adorer, 
placed the hundred pound note, which he had laid

upon her dressing-table, between two slices of bread 
and butter, and ate it as a sandwich. Captain Morris, ; 
in one of his songs, has set the proper value on these 
fencicd Eoman luxuries. 

" Old Lucullus, they say, 

Forty cooks had each day, 
And Vitellius's meals cost a million ; 

But I like what is good, 

When or where he my food, 
In a chop-house or royal pavilion. 

** At all feasts (if enough) 

I most heartily stu£^ 
And a song at my heart alike rushes, 

Though I've not fed my lungs 

Upon nightingales* tongues, 
Nor the hraitis of goldfinches and thrushes.

Neither have we much respect for epicures who 
could select so awkward and uncomfortable a position 
as a reclining one. It is quite frightful to think how 
they must have slobbered their long beards and togas, 
in conveying food from the table to their mouths 
without forks — for forks are clearly a modem dis- 
covery, none having been found in the ruins of Her- 
culaneum — and it is difficult to conceive how they 
could manage to drink at all, imless they sat up as 
the goblet was passed to them. Eating, however, 
had certainly engaged the attention of the Eoman 
men of science, although one only of their works on 
the subject has come down to us. It is supposed to 
have enlightened the public about the time of Helio- 
gabalua — and bears the name of * Apicius,' in honour 
of the connoisseur who spent about a million and a 
half of our money in the gratification of his palate, 
and then, finding that he had not above fifty thou-

sand pounicLs sterling left, killed himself for fear of 
dying of hunger. 

The period comprising the fidl of the Boman em- 
pire and the greater portion of the middle ages, was 
one of immitigated darkness for the fine arts. Charle- 
magne, as appears from his Capitularies, took a warm 
personal interest in the management of his table ; and 
the Normans, two or three centuries later, are said to 
have prided themselves on their superior taste and 
discrimination in this respect. Sir Walter Scott 
had good authority for the graphic details of their 
real or afiected refinement which are contained in 
his description of Prince John's banquet in 'Ivanhoe.' 
But the revival of cookery, like that of learning, is 
due to Italy. We are imable to fix the precise time 
when it there began to be cultivated with success, but 
it met with the most enlightened encouragement from 
the merchant-princes of Florence, and the French 
received the first rudiments of the science fi-om the 
professors who accompanied Catherine de Medicis to 
Paris.* There is a remarkable passage in Montaigne, 
which shows that the Italian cooks had learnt to put 
a proper estimate on their vocation, and that their 
mode of viewing it was still new to the French. 

*' I have seen amoDgst us," says Montaigne, " one of 
those artists who had been in the service of Cardinal Ca- 
rafla. He discoursed to me of this science de gueide with

that he was called ** Furcifer '* by his friends, from his using their

ITALIAN ORIGIN OF THE ART. 



a gravity and a magisterial air, as if he was speaking of 
some weighty point of theology. He expounded to me a 
difference of appetites : that which one has fasting ; that 
which one has after the second or third course; the 
methods now of satisfying and then of exciting and piquing 
it ; the police of sauces, first in general, and next particu* 
larising the qualities of the ingredients and their effects ; 
the differences of salads according to their season; that 
which should be warmed, that which should be served 
cold, with the mode of adorning and embellishing them to 
make them pleasant to the view. He then entered on 
the order of the service, full of elevated and important 
considerations — 

' N«c minimo sane discrimine refext 
Quo gesta lepores et quo gallina secetur.* 

And all this expressed in rich and magnificent terms, in 
those very terms, indeed, which one employs in treating of 
the government of an empire— I well remember my man.* 

The strongest proofe in favour of the excel- 
lence of the ancients in painting are deduced from 
the descriptions of the principles and effects of 
painting to be found in the poets, historians, and 
orators of antiquity, who, it is argued, would never 
have spoken as they do speak of it, had not those 
principles been understood, and those effects been 
at least partially produced.* Arguing in the same 
manner from the above passage, we infer that 
culinary science must have made no inconsiderable 
progress to enable Montaigne's acquaintance to dis- 
course upon it so eloquently. There is also good 

* This argument is well put in Webb's < Dialogues on Painting.' 



8 THE ART C¥ DINIKO. 

reason to beUeve that it had made some progress in 
England, for Carding Campeggio, one of the legates 
charged to treat with Henry VIII. concerning his 
divorco from Catherine, drew np a report on the 
state of English cookery as compared with that of 
Italy and France, probably by the express desire 
and for the especial nse of his Holiness the Pope. 
Henry, moreover, was a liberal rewarder of that sort 
of merit which ministered to the gratification of his 
appetites; and on one occasion he was so trans- 
ported with the flavour of a new pudding, that he 
gave a manor to the inventor. 

History, which has only become philosophical 
within the last century, and took little note of man- 
ners until Voltaire had demonstrated the importance 
of conunemorating them, affords no authentic materials 
for filling up the period which intervened between 
the arrival of Catherine of Medicis and the accession 
of Louis XIV., under whom cookery made pro- 
digious advances, being one while employed to give 
a zest to his glories, and then again to console him 
in their decline.* The name of his celebrated 
maitre d^hotely Bechamel — a name as surely destined 
to immortality by his sauce, as that of Herschel by 
his star, or that of Baffin by his bay — affords gua- 
rantee and proof enough of the discriminating ele- 
gance with which the royal table was served ; and, 
as may be seen in the memoirs and correspondence 

» Liqueurs were invented for the the use of Louis XIV. in his old 
age, when he could scarcely endure existence without a succession of 
artificial stimulants. His appetite in the prime of life was prodigious. 



AGE OF LOUIS iXaV.-^VATEL. 



of tiie time, Colbcfft, th^ celebrated administrator, 
and Conde, tlae great captain, were little, if at all, 
.behindhahd in' this respect with royalty. The 
closing scene of Vatel, the maitre d^ hotel of Conde, 
has been often quoted, but it forms so essential a 
.portion o£ this history, that we are under the abso- 
l\ite necessity of inserting it : — 

"I wrote you yesterday," says Madame de Sevigny, 
" that Vatel had killed himself; I here give you the affair 
in detail. The king arrived on the evening of the Thurs- 
day ; the collation was served in a room hung with jon- 
quils ; all was as could be wished. At supper there were 
some tables where the roast was wanting, on account of 
several parties which had not been expected. This affected 
Vatel. He said several times, * I am dishonoured ; this is 
a disgrace that I cannot endure.' He- said to Gourville, 
' My head is dizzy ; I have not slept for twelve nights ; 
assist me in giving orders.' Gourville assisted him as 
much as he could. The roast which had been wanting, 
not at the table of the king, but at the inferior tables, was 
constantly present to his mind. Gourville mentioned it to 
the prince ; the prince even went to the chamber of Vatel, 
and said to him, — * Vatel, all is going on well ; nothing 
could equal the supper of the king.' He replied, — * Mon- 
seigneur, your goodness overpowers me ; I know that the 
roast was wanting at two tables.' * Nothing of the sort,' 
said the prince ; * do not distress yourself, all is going on 
well.' Night came ; the fireworks failed ; they had cost 
feisrteen thousand francs. He rose at four the next morning, 
determined to attend to everything in person. He found 
everybody asleep. He meets one of the inferior purveyors, 
who brought only two packages of sea-fish: he asks^*"^ 



10 TEDB ABT OF DDUHG. 

that all ? ' * Yes, Sir.' The man was not aware tiiat 
Vatel had soit to all the seaports. Vafcel waits some 
time ; the other purveyors did not arrive ; his brain began 
to bmn ; he bdieved that there would be no more fish. 
He finds Gonrville ; he says to him, ' Monsieur, I shall 
never survive this disgrace.* Grourville made hght of it. 
Vatel goes up stairs to his room, places his sword against 
the door, and stabs himself to the heart ; bat it was not 
until the third blow, after giving himself two not mortal, 
that he fell dead. The fish, however, arrives horn all 
quarters ; they seek Vatel to distribute it ; they go to his 
room, they knock, they force open the door ; he is found 
bathed in his blood. They hasten to tell the prince, who 
is in despair. The duke wept : it was on Vatel that his 
journey fix)m Burgundy hinged. The prince related what 
had passed to the king, with marks of the deepest sorrow. 
It was attributed to the high sense of honour which he 
had after his own way. He was very highly commended ; 
his courage was praised and blamed at the same time. 
The king said he had delayed coming to Chantilly for five 
years, for fear of the embarrassment he should cause." 

Such are the exact terms in which Madame de 
Sevigny narrated one of the most extraordinary 
instances of self-devotion recorded in history. 
" Enfin, Manette, voila ce que c'etait que Madame 
de Sevigne et Vatel ! Ce gont ces gens-la qui ont 
honore le siecle de Louis Quatorze."* We subjoin a 
few reflections on the same subject taken from the 
Epistle dedicatory to the shade of Vatel, appropriately

himself because a miniature by Gibson was missing at the moment. 



VATEL — ^PRINCB DE SOUBISE. 11 

pirefixed to the concluding vbliune of the Almanach 
dee Cl-ourmands : — 

" Who was ever more worthy of the respect and grati- 
tude of true gourmands than the man of genius who would 
not survive the dishonour of the table of the great Cond4, 
who immolated himself with his own hands, because the 
sea-fish had not arrived some hours before it was to be 
served ? So noble a death insures you, venerable shade, 
the most glorious immortality ! You have proved that 
the fanaticism of honour can exist in the kitchen as Veil as 
in the camp, and that the spit and the saucepan have also 
their Catos and their Deciuses. 

" Your example, it is true, has not been imitated by any 
mattre d^hotel of the following century ; and in this philo- 
sophic age all have preferred living at the expense of their 
masters to the honour of dying for them. But your name 
will not be revered the less by all the friends of good 
cheer. May so noble an example ever influence the emu- 
lation of all mattres d'hdtel present and to come ! and if 
they do not imitate you in your glorious suicide, let them 
at least take care, by all means human, that sea-flsh be 
never wanting at our tables." 

The Prince de Soubise (immortalized by the sauce 
najned after him) also rejoiced in an excellent cook 
— a man of true science, with princely notions of 
expenditure. His master one day announced to 
him his intention to give a supper, and demanded 
a menu. The chef presented one with an estimate ; 
and the first article on which the prince cast his 
eyes was thia^'—fifti/ hams. "Eh! what!" said 
he ; " why, Bertrand, you must be out of your

". Jso, Monseigneut ! only- one ham will appear upon

nant artist, ^' you do not imderstand our resources : 
give the word, and these fifty hams which confound 
you, I will put them all into a glass bottle no bigger 
than my thimib." What answer could be mdde? 
The prince nodded> and the article passed. 

To turn for a m(Mnent to England — the state of 
cookery under Charles II. is sufficiently indicated 
by the names of Chiffinch and »Chaubert, to whose 
taste and skill the author of Waverley has borne 
ample testimony by his description of the dinner 
prepared for Smith, Granlesse^ and Peveril of the 
Peak, at the little Derbyshire inn : — 

* 

'* We could bring Jio chauffettes with any convenience ; 
and even Chaubert. is, nothing, unless his dishes are tasted 
in the very moment of projection. Come, uncover, and 
let us see what he has done for us. Hum! ha! ay — 
squab pigeons — wild-fowl — young chickens — venison ciit-; 
lets — and a space in the centre, wet, alas ! by a gentle tear 
from Chaubert's eye, where should have been the sovEpe 
aux ^arevisses. The zeal of that poor fellow is ill repaid 
by his paltry ten louis per month.'* — Pet»n?, vol. ii. 
p. 165. 

Decisive evidence of the palmy condition of the 
art in the seventeenth century is aflforded by ' TJae 



ENGLISH COOKERY M THE IWH CENTURY. 13 



Accomiplisht Cdok ' of Eobert May, the^fitst edition 
of which a{)peftred in 1665. In tile dedication 
to Lord Montague, Lord Lumlej, Lord Dormcit; 
and Sir Eeneim Digby, the author says, "In th^ 
mean space, that our English world may know iiie 
MsBoena's {sic) and patrons of this generous art, I 
have 'exposed this volume to the public, under the! 
tuitiosi of your names, at whose feet I prostrate 
these endeavours." 

He speaks rather contemptuously of the French 
cuisine, but acknowledges himself "not a little 
beholding to the Italian and Spanish treatises; 
though, without my fosterage and bringing np under 
the generosities and boimties of my noble patrons 
and masters, I could never have arrived to this ex- 
perience.^' This fosterage was certainly remarkable. 
From " a short narrative of some passages of thei 
Author's Life," modestly prefixed to the book, we 
learn that, having attained to some perfection under 
his father, one of the ablest cooks of his time, the 
old Lady Dormer sent him over to France, where he 
continued five years, in the family of a noble peer 
and first president of Paris. On his return he was 
bound apprentice to " Mr. Arthur Hollinsworth, in 
Newgate Market, one of the ablest workmen in 
London, cook to the Grocers' Hall and Star Cham- 
ber. His apprenticeship being out, the Lady Dor- 
mer sent for him to be her cook, under his father 
(who then served that honourable lady), where there 
were four cooks more ; such noble houses were then 
(about 1610) kept, the glory of that and the shame

of this present age. Then were those days wherein 
were practised the triumphs and trophies of cookery." 
One of these triumphs is the construction of a ship 
of confectionery, with guns charged with actual 
powder, and a castle of pies, containing live frogs 
and birds. After giving directions as to the firing 
of the guns, he proceeds : — 

" This done, to sweeten the stuik of powder, let the ladies 
take the egg-shells full of sweet waters and throw them at 
each other. All dangers being seemingly over, by this 
time you may suppose they will desire to see what is in

some frogs, which makes the ladies to skip and shreek ; 
next after the other pye, whence come out the birds, who, 
by a natural instinct, flying in the light will put out the 
candles ; so that, what with the flying birds and skipping 
frogs, the one above, the other beneath, will cause much 
delight and pleasure to the whole company : at length, the 
candles are lighted, and a banquet brought in, the musick 
sounds, and every one with much delight and content re- 
hearses their actions in the former passages " — i. e. whilst the 
candles were out — ** These were formerly the delights of 
the nobility before good housekeeping had left England, 
and the sword really acted that which was only counter- 
feited in such honest and laudable exercises as these." 

Under Queen Anne, again, the gouty queen of 
gourmands, who had Lister, one of the editors of the 
Apiciics, for her pet physician, and who, in fact, 
achieved the highest honour of gastronomy by 
giving her name to a pudding, cookery certainly 
did not suffer from any lack of encouragement ; but, 



CONFECTIONARY CONCEITS. 15 

soon after the accession of the House of Brunswids:, 
a fashion was introduced, which we cannot but think 
adverse to the true and proper object of the art :■ — 

** The last branch of our fashion," says Horace Walpole, 
" into which the close observation of nature has been intro- 
duced, is our desserts. Jellies, biscuits, sugar-plums, and 
creams, have long since given way to harlequins, gondo- 
hers, Turks, Chinese, and shepherdesses of Saxon china. 
But these, unconnected, and only seeming to wander 
among groves of curled paper and silk flowers, were soon 
discovered to be too insipid and unmeaning. By degrees, 
meadows of cattle, of the same brittle materials, spread 
themselves over the table; cottages rose in sugar, and 
temples in barley-sugar ; pigmy Neptunes in cars of cockle- 
shells triumphed over oceans of looking-glass or seas of 
silver-tissue. Women of the first quality came home from 
Chenevix's,^ laden with dolls and babies, not for their chil- 
dren, but their housekeeper. At last, even these puerile 
puppet-shows are sinking into disuse, and more manly 
ways of concluding our repasts are established. Gigantic 
figures succeed to pigmies ; and it is known that a cele- 
brated confectioner (Lord Albemarle's) complained that, 
after having prepared a middle dish of gods and goddesses 
eighteen feet high, his lord would not cause the ceiling of 
his parlour to be demolished to facilitate their entree. 
* Imaginez vous, said he, * que milord rCa pas voulu faire 
dter Uplafcmdl* 

" The Intendant of Gascony," adds Walpole, ** on the 
birth of the Duke of Burgundy, amongst many other 
magnificent festivities, treated the noblesse of the province 
with a dinner and a dessert, the latter of which concluded 
with a representation, by wax figures moved by clock- 
work, of the whole labour of the dauphineaa ^sA^JcvaV^^^ 



16 THE ART OF DINING. 

birtih of an heir to the monarchy.* — Lord OrfonTs Works^ 
vol. i. p. 149. 

Fortunately there were men of taste on both sides 
of the Channel, who made art minister to other pur- 
poses than vanity, and amongst these the Regent 
Duke of Orleans most signally distinguished himseK 
His petita soupers conferred a celebrity on the scene 
of them, which it still preserves, sufficiendy to 
justify the reply of the Frenchman, who, on being 
asked by a stranger in a remote part of Europe if he 
could tell him the direction of Paris, made answer, 
" Monsieur y ee chemin-lh vous conduira au Palais 
RoyaV^ There is a vague tradition that the chef of 
the Regent was pre-eminent in a dinde aux truffes. 

It was the fashion of his day for each guest to 
place a piece of gold in every dish of more than 
ordinary merit. This was an admirable method of 
calling out the genius of the artists ; for judicious 
praise is as necessary as discriminating censure to 
inspire energy and animate exertion. The Duke of 
Wellington once requested the connoisseur whom 
the author of * Tancred ' terms " the finest judge 
in Europe" to provide him a chef. Felix, whom 
the late Lord Seaford was reluctantly about to part 
with on /economical grounds, was recommended and 
received. Some months afterwards his patron was 
dining with Lord Seaford, and before the first course 
was half over he observed, " So I find you have got 
the Duke's cook to dress your dinner." "I have 
got Felix," replied Lord S., " but he is no longer 
the Duke's cook. The poor feUow come to me with 



DUKE OF WELLINGTON — ^LOUB XV. 17 

tears in his eyes and begged me to take him back 
again, at reduced wages or no wages at all, for he was 
determined not to remain at Apsley House. ^ Has 
the Duke been finding fault? ' said I. ^ Oh no, my 
lord ; I would stay if he had : he is the kindest and 
most liberal of masters ; but I serve him a dinner that 
would make Tide or Francatelli burst with envy, 
and he says nothing ; I serve him a dinner dressed, 
and badly dressed, by the cookmaid, and he says 
nothing. I cannot live with such a master, if he 
was a hundred timei^ a hero.' '* To facilitate criticism 
and individualize responsibility, it is the practice at 
some distinguished Kussian and German tables — at 
the Eoyal table of Hanover, in particular — to print 
in the carte — a copy of which is placed beside the 
plate of each guest — the name of the cook by whom 
each dish has been dressed, like the programme of a 
concert with the names of the performers. See the 
Appendix, No. 1. 

Louis XV., amidst his other luxuries, was not 
unmindful of that which, it has been sagaciously 
observed, harmonises with all other pleasures, and 
remains to console us for their loss. It is generally 
imderstood that tablcB volantes were invented under 
his eye : — 

/' At the petits soupers of Choisy (says the most graceful 
and 1#steful of poets) were first introduced those admirable 
pieces of mechaaism — a table apd a sideboard, which 
descended and rose again covered with viands and wines* 
And thus the most liULarioas court in Europe, af)er all its 
boasted refinements, was glad to return at last, by this

bonnet-making fame, tliat, when lie was occupied 
with the more recondite mysteries of his art, Iiis 
porter was wont to put oflf visitors with, *^ Monsieur 
n'est pas visible, il compose.*' When the Duo d'Es- 
cars and his royal master were closeted together to 
meditate a dish, the ministers were kept waiting in 
the antechamber, and the next day the following 
announcement regularly appeared in the oflScial jour- 
nals : — " M. le Due d'Escars a tra/vailU dans le ca- 
binet." Louis XVIIL had invented the truffes h la 
puree d' ortolans^ and, reluctant to disclose the secret 
to an ignoble confidant or menial, he invariably pre- 
pared the dish with his own royal hands, assisted 
by the Due. On one occasion they had jointly com- 
posed a dish of more than ordinary dimensions, and 
duly consumed the whole of it. In the middle of 
the night the Due was seized with a fit of indi- 
gestion, and his case was declared hopeless : loyal to 
the last, he ordered an attendant to wake and in- 
form the King, who might be exposed to a similar 
attack. His Majesty was roused accordingly, and 
told that his faithful servant was dying of his 
invention. " Dying ! " exclaimed Louis le Desire 
— " dying of my truffea a Ul^pur^e f I was right 
then. I always said that I had the better stomach 
of the two." 

The Eevolution bade feir at its commencement to 
brii^ back a long night of barbarism upon art ; and 
the destruction of the pre-existing races of amphi- 
tiyona and dinersrout was actually and most effici- 
ently accomplished by it. We alludft imis^. tssso^ m^

ill-got fortunes so gloriously as almost to make ga^ 
tronoipic philosophers forgetful of their origin. 
What a host of pleasing associations arise at 'tte 
bare mention of a dish a lafinancihre ! They were 
replaced, however, although slowly, by the inevi- 
table consequences of the events that proved JSitiad 
to them. The upstart chiefs of the republic, the 
plimdering marshals and parvenus nobles of ITapc^ 
leon, proved no bad substitutes in this way for the 
financiers, although they tried in vain to ape the 
gallant bearing, as well as the arms and titles, 6f 
the old feudal nobility. Amongst the most success- 
ful of this mushroom generation was Cambacer^s, 
second consul under the republic and arch-chan- 
cellor imder the empire, who never suffered the 
cares of government to distract his attention from 
" the great object of life." On one bccasioti, • for 
example, being detained in consultation with l^spOr

tbe ^i^ational Gxii^ention, — potatoes weie diesaed au

France. But both her ]ad j^p and Caieme are 
dearly in error when they say that one house alone 
(leg Frerei'Itobert) preserved the 8acred fire of the 
French kitchen through the shock. The error of 
this supposition will appear fixnn a brief sketch of 
iar the most important change effected by the revo- 
lution, — a change bearing the strongest possible 
affinity to that which the spread ci knowledge has 
effected in literature. 

The time has been when a patron was almost as 
indispensaUe to an author as a publisher: Spenser 
waiting in Southampton's ante-room was a fitvour- 
able illustration of the dass; and so long as this 
state of things lasted^ their independence of cha- 
racter, their position in society, their capacity for 
exertion, their style of thinking, were lowered, 
contracted, and cramped. Circumstances, which it 
is beside the present purpose to dwell upon, have 
widened the field of enterprise, and led literary 
men to depend almost exclusively on the public for 
patronage, to the manifest advantage of all parties. 
Precisely the same sort of change was effected in the 
state and prospects of French cookery by the Revolu- 
tion; which rapidly accelexatod, if it did not alto- 
gether originate, the establishment of what now

Tittue, and the habit of living m pttHic as. the

parallel with astanishment ; but it was perfectly 
weU-^facinided at the time. The first restaurateur in

of restaurateurs had increased to a hiuwired; in 1804 
(the date of the first appearance of the Alnumach 
de» Gtnirmands) to five or sik hundred; and it 
now considerably exceeds a thousand. Three dis- 
tinct causes are mentioned in the Almanax^h as 
having co-operated in the production and multipli- 
cation of these establi^unents. First, the rage for 
English fashions . which prevailed amongst the 
French during the ten or fifteen years immediately

with all the marshals and generals of taste, without 
regard to countiy, and spoke as much of the language 
of each as was necessary for his own peculiar sort of 
interoourse. His memory, also, is reported to have 
been such, that, after a lapse of twenty years, he 
could remember and address by name persons who 
had dined two or three times at his house ; and his 
mode of profiting by his knowledge was no less 
peculiar than his aptness in acquiring and retaining 
it. Divining, as it were by instinct, when a party 
of distinction were present, he was wont to approach^ 
their table with every tckcfn. of the profoundest sub- 
mission to dieir will and l^e warmest interest in

and the arrival of the bill gave ample evidence of 
the party^s having dined at a re^aurant. "Beau-

" made, unmade, and r^nade his fortune several 
times, nor is it exactly known in which of these 
phases he was surprised by death; but he had so 
many means of getting rid of his money, that no 
great prize could have devolved upon his heirs." 
Shortly before his exit he discharged the debt 
which, according to Lord Bacon, every man owes to 
his profession (though we should not be sorry if it 
were less fiequently paid), by the publication of his 
Art du Cimmier, in two volumes octavo. He died 
a few months before Napoleon. 

Careme, like his great rival, is an author, and an 
intrepid one, for in the preface to his Maitre d'ffotel 
Franqais he says, " I have proved incontestably 
that all the books, down to the present time, on our 
cuisine are fuU of errors;" and he then proceeds 
to give evidence of his own superior breeding, with 
his natural and acquired qualifications for the art. 
We have to thank himself and Lady Morgan, who 
prides herself on a personal acquaintance with him, 
for most of the leading particidars of his life.

that was not in perfect conformity with the freshness of

reflected the ^arii^ sonset, no brilliant silver dazded the

Now, not onlj does cookery adTance and vary upon 
the same principle, but its professors are subject to 
changes &om which the professors of other sciences 
are happily exempt. The &me of a restaurateur ^ 
always, in some sort, dependent upon fashioBy^-^^ibar A

necessary to seize the exact moment of projection am} 
infuse the last soupgon of piquancy, than to made the 
changing fortunes of a battle, or to execute a criticiil 
winning hazard at the billiard-table. Besides, jfew 
will be public-spirited enough to keep a choioe<^ 
rare things in readiness, imless the demand be bodbi 
constant and discriminating. We must, therefore, 
be held blameless in case of any disappointment re- 
sulting from changes subsequently to the commence-

We must also pause to conunemorate one defunct 
establishment, the far-famed Mocker de CancaU^ 
which has been broken up since the Bevolution of 
1848. It first grew into reputation by its oysters, 
which, about the year 1804, M. Baleine, its founder, 
contrived the means of bringing to Paris firesh and in 
the best possible order at all seasons alike ; thus giv- 
ing a direct practical refutation of the prejudice, that 
oysters are good in those monibs only which include

dictated his instructions, invariably concluding with 
the same phrase, uttered in an exulting self-gratula- 
tory tone — Bien^ Monsieur , voiis avez-ld un excdlent 
diner ! Never^ too, shall we forget the dignity with 
which he once corrected a blunder made in a menu 
by a tyro of the party, who had interpolated a 
salmi between the bisque and the turbot d la 
creme et au gratin* ^' Memeurs,^^ said he, as he 
brought in the turbot according to the pre-ordained 
order of things, " U poisson e^ naturellement le 
rdevd du potage^ The whole establishment was 
instinct with the same zeal. A report had got about 
in the autumn of 1834 that the celebrated chef was 
dead, and a scientific fiiend of ours took the liberty 
to mention it to the garqofriy avowing at the same 
time his own total incredulity. He left the room 
without a word, but within five minutes he hurriedly 
threw open the door, exclaiming, ^^ MessieurSy U 
vient se montrer ;" and sure enough the great artist 
in his own proper person presented himself, and our 
distinguished ally enjoyed the honour of a brief but 
pregnant conversation with a man whose works were 
more firequently in the mouths of his most enlightened 
contemporaries than those of any other great artist 
that could have been named. 

It is an odd coincidence that this zeal was most 
remarkable in the staff of another establishment which 
has also been discontinued, namely, Grignon's. On 
one occasion — to give an illustration of the head 
ff argon* 8 taste — he was apologising to the writer for the 
length of time a particular dish would take in dress-

ing. ^^M(m M(nmmr ne s'ennuiera pointy**— he 
added, presenting his neatly-boimd octavo volume of 
a carte — " voild une lecture tr^-agr^able ! " On 
another occasion — to give an illustration of his good 
faith — a friend of ours resolved on finishing with the 
very best wine that could be had, and the Clos de 
Vougeot was fixed on. The gargon took the order, 
but hesitated, and, after moving a few paces as if to 
execute it, stood still. It was evident that conflict- 
ing emotions were struggling for mastery in his soul, 
but the struggle terminated in our friend's favour, 
for he suddenly stole back to the table, and with the 
most unqualified admission of the excellence of the 
Clo8 de Vougeot^ which was generally in request — 
still, if he might ventiu:e to hint a preference, he 
would recommend a trial of the Richebourg instefui. 
Now, Eichebourg is by no means in the fiiist class of 
wines, and the wine in question was only five francs 
a bottle, whilst the Clo9 de Vougeot was twelve ; but 
our correspondent foimd every reason to rejoice in 
the discovery. 

Eemember, we do not vouch for the existence of 
this identical Eichebourg at any long subsequent 
period; for vintages are imfortunately not renew- 
able like hogsheads — and in Paris, where even some 
of the best restaurateurs pay comparatively little 
attention to their cellars, a first-rate wine of any sort 
may be described in the terms applied to a virtuous 
despot by the late Emperor Alexander ; who, when 
Madame de Stael was expatiating to him on the hap- 
piness of his subjects in the possession of such a czar^

ancients. These learned Scotch Professors caused a 
quantity of common snails to be collected in the fields 
and made into a kind of soup. They took their seats 
opposite to each other, and set to work in perfect 
grxxi faith. A mouthful or two satisfied both that

sponded Ferguson ; " tak' 'em awa, tak' 'em awa 1 " 



FROGS AND ROBII^-REDBREASTS. 37 

The robin-redbreast is remarkable for a delicate' 
bitter flavour ; but as our ingenuous reconunendation 
of him as an eatable commodity has been occasionally 
regarded as symptomatic of a latent tendency to 
cannibalism, it may be as well to state that the 
popular notion of his amiability, which rests upon 
the somewhat apocryphal story of the Children in 
the Wood, is altogether a mistake. Ornithologists 
are agreed that he is one of the most quarrelsome of 
birds ; and his loneliness is, in fact, the natural result 
of his pugnacity. At all events, the following argu- 
ment does not admit of a logical reply : — 

** Le rouge-gorge," says the Almanach, ** est la triste 
preuve de cette verity — que le gourmand est par essence un 
eti*e inhumain et cruel ! car il n'a aucune pititJ de ce char- 
mant petit oiseau de passage, que sa gentillesse et sa fami- 
liarite confiante devraient mettre a Tabri de nos atteintes. 
Mais s^ilfaUmt avoir compassion de tout le monde, on m 
mangerait personne ; et commiseration k part, il faut con- 
venir que le rouge-gorge, qui tient un rang distingu^ dans 
la classe des becs-figues, est un roti tres succulent. On en 
fait a Metz et dans la Lorraine et I'Alsace, un assez grand 
commerce. Get aimable oiseau se mange a la broche et en 
salmi." 

The following letter from one of the most eminent 
of living connoisseurs contains an accurate classifi- 
cation and description of the principal Restaurants 
now existing in Paris ; and we do not know that we 
can do better than print it as it stands : —

" You must Lave remarked, when yea were here, that at 
all the tirst-^iass restaurants vou had Dearlr the same din- 
ner ; they may, however, be divided inlo three categories. 
Ucdouhte^lly the best for a great dinner and good wine are 
the P'reres Proven^aux, Palais Royal ; Philippe, Roe Mont 
Orgueil; and the Cafe de Paris: the latter is not always to be 
counted u[x^n, but is excellent when they give you a scigni 
dinner. In the second class are Very (Palais Royal) : Velbor: 
Cafe Anglais ; and Champeaox (Place de la Bourse), where 
you can liave a most conscientious dinner, good without 
preteasion; the situation is central, in a beantifbl gar- 
derj, and you must ask for a UfsUk a la Chateaubriand, 
At the head of the third class we must place Bouvallet, on 
the Boulevart du Temple, near all the little theatres; 
Defieux, chiefly remarkable for corporation and assembly 
dinners ; Durand, Place de la Madeleine ; Ledoyen, in the 
Chamjjs Elys^, where is also Guillemin, formerly cook to 
the Due de Vincennes. The two best places for suppers 
are the Maison d'Or and the Caf<$ Anglais; and for break- 
fasts, Tortoni's, and the Cafe d*Orsay on the Qoai d'Orsay. 
In the vicinity of Paris the best restaurant is the Pavilion 
Henri Qnatre, at St. Germains, kept by the old cook of 
the Duchosse de Berri. At none of these places could you 
find dinners now such as were produced by Ude ; by Soyer, 
formerly with Lord Chesterfield; by Rotival, with Lord 
Wilton ; or by Perron, with Lord Londonderry. 

** I must not forget to mention the two great contractors 
for dinners and suppers : these are Chevet, of the Palais 
Royal, and Potel, of the Boulevart des Italiens. The best 
possible materials may be procured at these establishments, 
but the dinners of Chevet and Potel are expensive and

vulgar — a sort of tripotage of truffles, cocks'-combs, craw- 
fish mounted on the back of a fillet of beef, and not a 
single entrSe which a connoisseur can eat ; the roast game 
always tourmevdes and cold, for their feathers are stuck on 
again before they are served up. 

" You ai'e now au fait of the pretended French gastro- 
nomy. It has emigrated to England, and has no wish to 
return. We do not absolutely die of hunger here, and that 
is all that can be said." 

THs letter, complete so iar as it goes, suggests a 
few reflections, and admits of a few additions. The 
transitory nature of gastronomic glory needs no 
further illustration when we find V4ry degraded to 
the second class. The two brothers of that name 
once stood at the very head of the first. Allusion has 
already been made to a decisive indication of their 
greatness in 1814, when they were commissioned by 
the Allied Sovereigns to purvey for them during their 
stay; and so long as their establishment on the 
Tuileries was left standing, the name of Very re- 
tained its talismanic powers of attraction, the delight 
and pride of gastronomy— 

'* Whilst stands the Colisemn, Rome shall stand ; 
And whilst Rome stands, the world — " 

but when the house in question was removed to 
make way for the public buildings which now rest 
upon its site, the presiding genius of the family 
deserted it — ex illo retro fluere et mblapsa referrL 
Dea^, too, intervened, and carried ofi* the most dis- 
tinguished of the brothers. A magnificent monu- 
ment was erected to his memory in Pere la CJiamy

The estabLLshment of M. Philippe is dose to 
what was once the Mocker de CanedUj but Cm 
the opposite side of the Eve Mont OrffueU^ and 
(making due allowance for the geneial dedine of 
Parisian cookciy) it fills pretty nearly the same 
rektive place in the estimation of the connoiseeur. 
His prices are not extravagant; and a party of 
six or seven may have an excellent dinner for 
twenty fiancs a^head, exclusive of wine. This was 
the price of a dinner which made some noise in 
the spring of 1850. The party consisted of Lord 
Brougham, M. Alexandre Dumas, Count D'Qrsay, 
Lord Dufferin, the Hon. W. Stuart (attached to the 
embassy), Mr. John Dundas, of Carron, and the writ^ 
of these pages. It was ordered by the writer after 
an anxious consultation with Count D'Qrsay ; and 
it was delightful to see the enlightened enthusiasm 
by which M. Philippe, his chefy and his waiters^ 
were, one and all, animated on the occasion. The 
most successful dishes were the bisque, the fritures 
ItalienneSy and the gigot a la Bretonne, Out of com- 
pliment to the world-wide fame of Lord Brougham 
and M. Alexandre Dumas, M. Philippe produced 
some Clos de Vougeot, which (like his namesake in 
* High Life Below Stairs ') he vowed should never go 
down the throat of a man whom he did not esteem and 
admire ; and it was voted first-rate by acclamatipn. 

Amongst the dishes most in fashion at Philippe's 
may be specified, in addition to the three named

' An elaborate dinned? fbr a krge party at the 
Troie Frhres is certainly inferior to a corref?pondiaJg 
fciMiquet at PHliprpe's ; but, on the other hand, an 
improvised dinner in the common room for two or 
three is, on an average, the best thing of the sort 
in Paris, if it is ordered by a qualified habitad. 
Amongst the fiivourite dishes at the Troia Frhrea are 
the hiique^ the potage a la purie de marram^ the 
cdtelettes h la Provengale, the omelette souffl4e h la 
vanille, and the croute avx anarias. The wines at 
this establishment are much esteemed, particularly 
the Pichon (a light dinner-wine), the Ghrand La- 
fitte of 1834 and 1841, the Fleur de SiOery, the 
Vieux Pommard, and the Romance GelS. 

The CafS de Paris has declined in general repu- 
tation of late years, but it still retains some of its 
pristine merits and advantages. The rooms are lofty ; 
there is no lack of fresh air, the look-out on the 
Botdevards is gay and enlivening, and the fish is 
generally good. The filets de sole h VOrly is a 
plat which may be had in perfection, at the Caf4; 
and it may be taken for granted that M. Veron 
trould not dine there every day, the centre of an 
admiring circle, unless a great many other good 
things were to be had. The Maison Dor^e is fa- 
B(K)us for its cronte au pot. The Pavilion Senri 
Quatre, at St. Germains, favourably mentioned by 
our correspondent, will justify his praise ; its fried 
gudgeons are superior to those of the York House at

Bath, and the fiiet de boeuf a la Bemaise is not to be 
had anywhere else. The choicest champagne there 
is called vin du Priddmty being, we presume, the 
precise description of wine which the President 
caused to be served out to the troops at Satory, and 
it probably harmonizes admirably with sausages. 

Hardy and Riche have been condemned to a 
critical kind of notoriety by a pun — * Pour diner 
chez Hardy, il faut etre riche ; et pour diner chez 
Eiche, il faut etre hardi.' Hardy has been immor- 
talized by Moore in the Fudge Family : — 

" I strut to the old cafe Hardy, which yet 
Beats the field at a dejeuner a la fourchette : 
Then, Dick, what a breakfast ! oh, not like your ghost 
Of a breakfast in England, your curs'd tea and toast ; 
But a sideboard, you dog, where one's eye roves about, 
Like a Turk's in the harem, and thence singles out 
One's pate of larks, just to tune up the throat ; 
One's small limbs of chicken, done en papUlote ; 
One's erudite cutlets, dress'd always, but plain — 
Or one's kidneys — imagine, Dick — done with champagne ; 
Then some glasses of Beaune, to dilute — or mayhap 
Chambertin, which you know *s the pet tipple of Nap.* 
Your cofiee comes next, by prescription ; and then, Dic^, 's 
The coffee's ne'er failing, and — glorious appendix — 
A neat glass oi parf ait-amour ^ which one sips 
Just as if bottled velvet tipp'd over one's lips," 

Tortoni, however, the Gunter of Paris, is still the 
favourite for a dejeuner ; and parfait-amour is ob- 
solete. Claret for boys, port for men, and brandy 
for heroes, was the decision of Johnson, and there 
can be no doubt that old Cognac is your true chaase 
for the heroes of gastronomy. If tempted to indulge 

* In justice to Napoleon, it ought to be remembered that Cham' 
bertin was not his " pet tipple " on serious occasions. In his carris^e, 
taken at Waterloo, were found two bottles nearly empty — the one of 
Malaga, and the other of Bvm, 



LIQUEURS. 43 



in a liqueur or chasse-cafh, they generally confine 
themselves to curagoa. Even with ladies, parf ait- 
amour , notwithstanding the attraction of its name, 
is no longer in repute ; they have adopted Maras- 
chino in its place, and sip it with such evident 
symptoms of enjoyment, that once upon a time, 
when a certain ' eminent diplomatist was asked by 
his voisine, at a petit-souper, for a female toast, to 
parallel with the masculine one of Women and 
Wine, his Excellency gave Men and Maraschino, 
which elicited very general applause. 

Colonel Damer was one day dining at Beauvilliers', 
in 1814, just after the first Eestoration, when a 
Eussian officer, having finished his dinner, inquired 
what liqueur was most in vc^e. The waiter re- 
plied " La liqtieur a la mode. Monsieur ? — mais 
cest h petit lait dUSenri Quatre" Here the waiter 
had the best of it. But the writer was once dining 
at the Hocher de Cancale, soon after the suppres- 
sion of the last Polish insurrection, in company with 
a Eussian officer, when the waiter having thought 
proper to give vent to his enthusiasm for the Polish 
cause rather too audibly, was suddenly ordered by 
our Eussian frielid to bring us un jeune Polonais 
bien jrappi. 

The following advice may still be implicitly de- 
pended upon : — 

" If some who *re Lotharios in feeding, should wish, 
Jast to flirt with a luncheon (a devilish bad trick, 
As it takes off the bloom of one's appetite, Dick) —

The place indicated is Mcidame Felixes, the de-

twelve and fifteen thousand a day. 

We have spoken of the important effects produced 
by the breaking out of the Eevolution. We now 
proceed to mention the no less important effects 
produced by the conclusion of it — or rather of one of 
its great stages — which are most dramatically indi- 
cated by the author of the Physiologie. 

" By the treaty of November, 1815," says M. Brillat- 
Savarin, " France was bound to pay the sum of 50,000,000 
francs within three years, besides claims for compensation 
and requisitions of various sorts, amounting to nearly as 
much more. The apprehension became general that a 
national bankruptcy must ensue ; the more particularly as 
all was to be paid in specie. * Alas !* said the good people 
of France, as they saw the fatal tumbrel go by on its way 
to be filled in the Rue Vivienne, * Alas I our money is 
emigrating; next year we shall go down on our knees 
before a five-franc piece ; we are about to fall into the con- 
dition of a ruined man ; speculations of all sorts will foil ; 
there will be no such thing as borrowing ; it will be weak- 
ness, exhaustion, civil death.' The event proved the ap- 
prehension to be folse ; and to the great astonishment of 
all engaged in finance-matters, the payments were made 
with facility, credit rose, loans were eagerly caught at, and 
during the whole time this superpurgation lasted, the 
balance of exchange was in favour of France; which proves 
that more money came into than went out of it. What 
is the power that came to our assistance? Who is the 
divinity that effected this miracle? — Gourfnandise. When 
the Britons, Germans, Cimmerians, and Scythians broke 
into France, they brought with them a rate voracity and

stomachs of no ordinary calibre. They did not long remain 
satisfied with the official cheer which a forced hospitality 
supplied to them; they aspired to more refined enjoy- 
ments ; and in a short time the queen city was little more 
than an immense refectory. 

** The effect lasts still ; foreigner flock from every 
quarter of Europe, to renew during peace the pleasing 
habits they contracted during the war ; they must come to 
Paris ; when there, they rmist eat and drink without regard 
to price ; and if our funds obtain a preference, it is owing 
less to the higher interest they pay, than to the instinctive 
confidence it is impossible to help reposing in a people 
amongst whom gourmands are so happy ! " — vol. i. 
p. 239. 

To give an individual illustration of the principle 
— when the Eussian army of invasion passed through 
Champagne, they took away six hundred thousand 
bottles from the cellars of M. Moet of Epemay ; but 
he considered himself a gainer by the loss, his orders 
from the North having more than doubled since then, 
although most of the champagne drunk in Kussia is 
made in the Crimaea. M. Moet's cellars, be it said 
in passing, are peculiarly deserving of attention, 
and he is (or was) always happy to do the honours 
to travellers. We ourselves visited them in 1835, 
and were presented, at parting, with a bottle of the 
choicest wine — a custom, we understand, invariably 
observed in this munificent establishment. 

Be the cause what it may, the taste for French 
cookery is now universally diffused ; nor is it confined 
to the Old World, for amongst the other special 
missions intrusted to M. Aimand de BretJOLCsal Vs^

Bolivar was that of bringing over the best cook he 
oould get. Those who ma j be intrusted with simi- 
lar missions would do well to consult Mercier's 
Tableau de Paris, where cooks are classified hy 
provinces. " The best," he says, " are ficom Pi- 
card j ; those firom Orleans come next ; then Flan- 
ders, Burgundy, Comtois, Lorraine; the Parisian 
last but*one, and the Korman last of alL" But it is 
riot enough to choose your cook ; it is your boimden 
duty, and (what is more) your interest, sedulously 
and imceasingly to watch over his health. The 
orthodox doctrine on this point has been fiilly deve- 
loped in an elaborate essay, entitled De la SantS des 
CuisinierSf from the pen of no less a person than Gri- 
maud de la Eeyniere, the editor of the Almanach — 

" L'index d'un bon cuisinier doit cheminer sans cesse des 
casseroles a sa langue, et ce n'est qu'en degostant ainsi a 
chaque minute ses ragodts qu'il peat en dc^terminer Fassai-

The late Marquis of Hertford had a cook who, in 
his master's opinion, was inimitable in a supreme. 
Dining one day with an intimate friend, a distin- 
guished Privy Councillor, who had frequeiMy con- 
tested the point, his Lordship declared the mpreme, 
whicji he was with diflSculty persuaded to taste, de- 
testable. ** Now I have you," exclaimed the Eight 
Honourable friend ; " that dish was dressed by your 
own chef, who is at this moment in my house." " Then 
all I can say," replied the Marquis, " is that you 
have spoiled his palate by drinking beer with him." 

We have now arrived at the literature of the Art. 
The * Almanach des Gourmands ' was the first 
serious and sustained attempt to invest gastronomy 
with the air of an intellectual and refined pursuit. 
But incomparably the completest essay on what 
may be termed the ajsthetics of the dinner-table, is 
the femous PhyBiologie du GoiU^ and a short bio- 
graphical sketch of the author may not be imaccept- 
able as an introduction to a few extracts from the work. 

Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, judge of the Court of 
Cassation, member of the Legion of Honour, and of 
most of the scientific and literary societies of France, 
was bom in 1755 at Belley. He was bred up to his 
fiither's profession of the law, and was practising 
with some distinction as an advocate, when (in 
1789) he was elected a member of the Constituent

Afisembly, where he joined the moderate party, and 
did his best to avert the ruin that ensued. At the 
termination of his legisIatiYe duties, he was ap* 
pointed President of the Civil Tribunal of the de- 
partment of JJAin^ and on the establishment of the 
Court of Cassation he was made a judge of it. During 
the reign of terror he found himself amongst the 
proscriUfcd, and fled for refuge to Switzerland, where 
he contrived to while away the time in scientific, 
literary, and gastronomical pursuits. He was after- 
wards compelled to emigrate to America, where also 
his attention seems rarely to have been diverted 
fix)m the study in which he was destined to immor- 
talize himself. It is related of him, that once, on 
his return from a shooting expedition, in the course 
of which he had the good fortune to kill a wild tur- 
key, he fell into conversation with Jefferson, who 
began relating some interesting anecdotes about 
Washington and the war, when, observmg the 
distracted air of M. Brillat-Savarin, he stopped, and 
was about to go away: **My dear sir," said our 
gastronomer, recovering himseif by a strong effort, 
" I beg a thousand pardons, but I was thinking 
how I shoidd dress my wild turkey." He earned 
his subsistence by teaching French and music, an 
art in which he excelled. He returned to France 
in 1796, and, after filling several employments 
of trust imder the Directory, was re-appointed to 
his old office of judge o^ the Court of Cassation, 
in which he continued imtil his death in 1826. The 
Phymlogie du Gout was published some time in 



the year 1825, and ran r6.pidly thitrtigJi'&'!0 bf ria^^ 
editions, besides teprints in Belgium. Its gtefeiJ 
chajrm consists in the singtdar mixture of wit, hu-'

dialogue between the author and a friend as to the 
expediency of publication, a biographical notice of 
the friend, thirty meditations, and a concluding 
miscellany of adventures, inventions, and anecdotes. 
The Meditations (a term substituted for chapters) 
form the main body of the work, and relate to the

obesity; 22. treatment preventive or curative of 
obesity; 23. leanness; 24. fasts; 25. exhaustion; 
26. death; 27 , philosophical history of the kitchen ; 
28. restaurateurs ; 29. classical gastronomy put in 
action ; 30. gastronomic mythology. 

Such is the menu of this book. Amongst such a 
collection of dainties it is difficult to select, but we 
quote the following reflections on the pleasures of 
the table, in the hope that they may help to dis- 
sipate some portion of the vulgar prejudice against 
gourmets, whose high vocation is too frequently 
associated in the minds of the imenlightened with 
gluttony and greediness : 

** The pleasure of eating is common to us with animals; 
it merely supposes hunger, and that which is necessary to 
satisfy it. The pleasure of the table is peculiar to the 
human species; it supposes antecedent attention to the 
preparation of the repast, to the choice of place, and the 
assembling of the guests. The pleasure of eating requires, 
if not hunger, at least appetite ; the pleasure of the table 
is most fi'equently independent of both. 

'* Some poets complained that the neck, by reason of 
its shortness, was opposed to the duration of the pleasure 
of tasting; others deplored the limited capacity of the 
stomach (which will not hold, upon the average, more 
than two quarts of pulp) ; and Roman dignitaries went 
the length of sparing it the trouble of digesting the first 

meal, to have the pleasure of swallowing a second 

The delicacy of our manners would not endure this practice ; 
but we have done better, and we have arrived at the same 
end by means recognized by good t&ste. Dishes have 
been invented so attractive, that they unceasingly renew 



BRILL AT-SAVARIN. 51 

the appetite, and which are at the same time so light, 
that they flatter the palate without loading the stomach. 
Seneca would have called them Nuhes Esculentas, We 
are, indeed, arrived at such a degree of alimentary pro- 
gression, that if the calls of business did not compel us to 
rise from table, or if the want of sleep did not interpose, 
the duration of meals might be almost indefinite, and there 
would be no sm'e data for determining the time that might 
elapse between the first glass of Madeira* and the last 
glass of punch." 

It may not be deemed beside the purpose to state 
that M. Brillat-Savarin was of a sober, moderate, 
easily-satisfied disposition; so much so, indeed, 
that many have been misled into the supposition 
that his enthusiasm was imreal, and his book a 
piece of badinage written to amuse his leisure 
hours. The writer of these pages has been frequently 
exposed to depreciating remarks of the same ten- 
dency, but has contrived to bear up against the 
calumny. 

An anecdote (related to Colonel Damer by Talley- 
rand) may help to rescue the fair fame of Brillat- 
Savarin* from the reproach of indifference, and 
illustrate the hereditary quality of taste. He was 
on his way to Lyons, and was determined to dine at 
Sena. On his arrival he sent, according to his in- 
variable custom, for the cook, and asked what he 
could have for dinner ? The report was dispiriting. 

♦ The custom of taking Parmesan with, and Madeira after, soup, 
was introduced into France bj M. Talleyrand.

*' Little enough," was the reply. ** But let m 
see,** retorted M. Savarin, "let us go to the 
kitchen and talk the matter over.** In the kitchen 
he found four turkeys roasting. " Why !** exclaimed 
he, " you told me you had nothing in the house. 
Let me have one of these turkeys." " Lnpossible ! " 
said the cook, " they are all bespoken by a gentle- 
man upstairs.'' " He must have a large party to 
dine with him then ? " " No, he dines by himself." 
" I should like much to be acquainted with the man 
who orders four turkeys for his own eating." The 
cook was sure that the gentleman would be glad of 
his acquaintance ; and M. Brillat-Savarin imme- 
diately paid his respects to the stranger, who turned 
out to be his own son. " What, you rogue, four 
turkeys all for yourself?" "Yes, sir; you know 
that, whenever I dine with you, you eat up the 
whole of les-sotS'les-laissent" — the titbit which we 
call the oyster of the turkey or fowl — " I was re- 
solved to enjoy myself for once in my life, and here 
I am, ready to begin, although I did not expect the 
honour of your company.'' 

It may not be deemed an unpardonable digression 
to state here that the late Lord Alvanley had his 
supreme de volatile made of the oysters, or lessots- 
' les-laissent, of fowls, instead of the fillet from the 
breast ; so that it took a score of fowls to complete 
a moderate dish. The same distinguished epicure, 
who was also one of the three or four pleasantest 
companions and wittiest men of the century, held 



CQNVmAL MAXIVS. 53 

that partridges were only worth eating in July, and 
he used to be regularly furnished with them from his 
own estate during that month. 
To proceed with our extracts : — 

** But, the impatient reader will probably exclaim, how 
then is a meal to be regulated, in order to unite all things 
requisite to the highest pleasures of the table ? I proceed 
to answer this question. 

"1. Let not the number of the company exceed twelve, 
that the conversation may be constantly general. 

'' 2. Let them be so selected that their occupations shall 
be varied, their tastes analogous, and with such points of 
contact that there shall be no necessity for the odious 
formality of presentations. 

'* 3. Let the eating-room be luxuriously lighted, the 
cloth remarkably clean, and the atmosphere at the tem- 
perature of from thirteen to sixteen degrees of Reaumur. 

*' 4. Let the men be spiritvds without pretension — the 
women pleasant without too much coquetr}'.* 

*' 6. Let the dishes be exceedingly choice, but limited 
in number, and the wines of the first quality, each in its 
degree. 

'* 6. Let the order of progression be, for the first (the 
dishes), from the most substantial to the lightest ; and for 
the second (the wines), firom the simplest to the most 
perfumed. 

'* 7. Let the act of consumption be deliberate, the 
dinner being the last business of the day; and let the 
guests consider themselves as travellers who are to arrive 
together at the same place of destination. 

* ** I write," says the author in a note, " between the Palais Royal 
and the Chaassee d'Antin." 



54 THE ART OF DINIXG. 

" 8. Let the coffee be hot, and the liqaeors chosen by 
tJio master. 

"9. Let the saloon be large enough to admit of a game 
at cards for those wlio cannot do without it, and so that 
there may notwithstanding remain space enough for posjb- 
meridian colloquy. 

" 10. Let the party be detained by the charms of society, 
and animated by the hope that the evening will not pass 
without some ulterior enjoyment. 

"11. Let the tea be not too strong; let the toast be 
scientifically buttered, and the punch carefully prepared. 

*' 12. Let not the retreat commence before eleven^ but 
let everybody be in bed by twelve. 

** If any one has been present at a party uniting these 
twelve requisites, he may boast of having been present at 
his own apotheosis." — vol. i. pp. 297-302. 

M. Brillat-Savarin has here omitted one very im- 
portant requisite, which it may be as well to supply 
without delay from another section of his book. 

** Aphorism. — Of aU the qualities of a cooky the most 
indispemable is punctualxty. 

** I shall support this gi*ave maxhn by the details of an 
observation made in a party of which I was one — quoriem 
pars magna fui — and where the pleasure of observing 
saved me from the extremes of wretchedness. 

" I was one day invited to dine with a high public 
functionary (CambaaJres) ; and at the appointed mon>ent, 
half-past rive, everybody had arrived, for it was known 
that he liked punctuality, and sometimes scolded the 
dilatory. I was struck cm my arrival by the air of oon-» 
sternation that reigned in the assembly ; they spoke asidei

stupe£iction : something extraordinary had certainly come 
to pass. I approached one of the party whom I judged 
most capable of satisfying my ciu'iosity, and inquired what 
had happened. *Alas!' replied he, with an accent of 
the deepest sorrow, 'Monseigneur has been sent for to 
the Council of State ; he has just -set out, and who knows 
when he will return T ' Is that all ?' I answered, with an 
air of indifference which was alien from my heart ; * that 
is a matter of a quarter of an hour at the most ; somie in- 
formation which they require ; it is known that there is an 
official dinner here to < day — they can have no motive for 
making us fast' I spoke thus ; but at the bottom of my 
soul I was not without inquietude, and I would fain have 
been somewhere else. The first hour passed pretty well ; 
the guests sat down by those with whom they had interests 
in common, exhausted the topics of the day, and amused 
tliemselves in conjecturing the cause which had carried off 
our dear Amphitryon to the Tuileries. By the second 
hour some symptoms of impatience began to be observ- 
able; we looked at one another with distrust; and the 
first to murmur were three or four of tlie party who, not 
having found room to sit down, were by no means in a 
convenient position for waiting. At the third hour Ae 
discontent became general, and everybody complained. 
• When wiM he come back ?* said one. ' What can he be 
thinking of?' said another. * It is enough to give one one's 
death,' said a third. By the fourth hour all the symptoms 
w^re aggravated ; and I was not listened to when I ven- 
tured to say that he whose absence rendered us so mise- 
rable was beyond a doubt the most naiserable of all. 
Attention was distracted for a moment by an apparition. 
One of the party, better acquainted with the house than 
the others, penetrated to the kitchen ; he returned quite

overcome ; his face annoonced the end of the world ; and 
he exclaimed in a voice hardly articulate, and in that 
muffled tone which expresses at the same time the fear of 
making a noise and the desire of being heard, 'Mon- 
seigneur went out without giving orders ; and, however long 
his absence, dinner will not be served till his return/ He 
spoke, and the alarm occasioned by his speech will not be 
surpassed by the effect of the trumpet on the day of judg- 
ment. Amongst all these martyrs, the most wretched wias 
the good D'Aigrefeuille,* who is known to all Paris ; his 
body was all over suffering, and the agony of Laocoon was 
in his face. Pale, distracted, seeing nothing, he sat croQchdd 
upon an easy chair, crossed his little hands upon his laiige 
belly, and closed his eyes, not to sleep, but to wait the 
approach of death. Death, however, came not Towards 
ten, a carriage was heard rolling into the court ; the whole 
party sprang spontaneously to their legs. Hilarity suc- 
ceeded to sadness ; and in ^ve minutes we were at table. 
But alas! the hour of appetite was past! All had the air 
of being surprised at beginning dinner at so late an hottr ; 
the jaws had not that isochronous (isochrone) movement 
which announces a regular work ; and I know that many 
guests were seriously inconvenienced by the delay."r— 
vol. i. pp. 93-96. 

On the part of the guests, also, punctuality should 

be regarded as imperative ; and the habitual want 

of it may commonly be set down to afiectation or fo 

long-indulged selfishness. Eather than place the 

slightest restraint on himself, the transgressor makis 

a whole party "uncomfortable. It is no answer 'to

my that they can sit down without him, for a well- 
■■selected company may be spoilt by a gap ; and a late 
arrival causes discomfort and confusion in exact pro- 
portion to the care that has been taken in the pre- 
paratory arrangements. Lady Morgan, in one of 
her early works, speaks of a young nobleman who 
never saw soup or fish except at his own table. This 
was understood to refer to an ex-Foreign Secretary, 
The late Lord Dudley used to say that the most 
unpunctual persons he ever knew were two dis- 
! tinguished brothers — the survivor is now a peer — 
for, added his lordship, if you asked Eobert for 
Wednesday at seven, you got Charles on Thursday 
at eight. 

It is currently related of a distinguished peer 
that he was once observed mounting his horse 
for his afternoon ride by the party assembled for 
diimer in his drawing-room. The authenticity of 
this anecdote, however, may well be doubted ; for 
his lordship is one of the most liberal and imcom- 
.promiaing patrons of the culinary art^ and would 
never have risked the reputation of his chef — 
although he might have made light of the health 
• and comfort of his guests— r by such an unprincipled 
and unfeeling disregard of the essential duty of a 
dinner*giver. The great Careme was in his serAice 
for a short period ; and his lordship once gave a very 
remarkable proof of his enlightened and patriotic 
desire to make his own country the head-quarters of 
gastronomic refinement. Dining (so goes the storY\

stoick with the whole arrangements, as well as with 
the exquisite composition and executioii, of the din- 
ner, that the very next day he intimated, through 
a trusty agent, to the Baron's maitre d^hStel, chef, 
and confectioner, that engagements at increased 
salaries were at the disposal of all three, if they 
would exchange their Jewish allegiance for the ser- 
vice of a Christian nobleman. They are said to 
have refused, with some marks of indignation ; and 
it must be admitted that the offer partakes some- 
what of the spirit in which Christian noblemen 
dealt with Jew financiers in the olden time ; for you 
might as well draw a man's teeth at once as deprive 
him of the means of employing them with his 
wonted gusto. ^ 

The Meditation entitled Ghurmandise is replete 
with instructive remark ; but we must confine oxir- 
selves to that part of it which relates to the ladies, 
some of whom, since Lord Byron's * silly prejudices 
upon the subject were made public, think it prettiest 
and most becoming to profess a total indifference as 
to what they eat. Let them hear the professor on 
this subject : — 

*' Gourmandise is by no means unbecoming in women ; 
it agrees with the delicacy of their organs, and servjBS to 
compensate them for some pleasures from which they are 
obliged to abstain, and for some evils to which nature 
appears to have condemned them. Nothing is more plear. 
sant than to see a pretty gourmande under arms : her nap- 

* Goethoy in WilJiehn Mektcr^ expresses a similar dislike to seeing 
women eat, .

kiA is nicely adjusted ; one of her hands is rested cyi X\i^^ 
table; the other conveys to her mouth little mpr^el^ el^n • 
ganlily carved, or the wing of a partridge which it isnecesr • 
saty .to pick ; her eyes are sparkling, her lips glossy, her 
c(^pi[ersation agreeable, all her movements gracious ; she is 
not ,^ void of that spice of coquetterie which women infuse 
into., every thing. * Witli so many advantages she is irre- 
sistibje ; and Cato the Censor himself would yield to the 
influence. 

** The penchant of the fair sex for gourmandise has in it 
somewhat of the nature of instinct, for gourmtindise is 
fivoiirable to beauty. A train of exact and rigid observa- 
tibns have demonstrated that a succulent, delicate, and 
careful regimen repels to a distance, and for a length of 
time, the external appearances of old age. It gives more 
brilliancy to tlie eyes, more freshness to the skin, more 
support to the muscles ; and as it is certain in physiology 
that it is the depression of the muscles which causes 
wrinkles, those formidable enemies of beauty, it is equally 
true to say that, cater is paribus^ those who understand eating 
are comparatively ten years younger than tliose who arestran- 
gers to this science. The painters and sculptors are deeply 
penetrated with this truth, for they never represent those 
who practise abstinence by choice or duty, as misers and 
anchorites, without giving them the paleness of disease, 
thef leanness of poverty, and the wrinkles of decrepitude. 

'*' Again, gourmandise^ when partaken, has the most 
marked influence on the happiness of tlie conjugal state. 
A wedded pair endowed with this taste have once a-day, 
at knst, an agreeable cause of meeting. Music, no doubt, 
has powerful atti-actions for those who love it ; but it is 
necessary to set about it, — it is an exertion. Moreover,

Considering the high pnTilegi^s attached to the 
character of a gourmand, no cne will be surprised at 
finding that it is not to be assumed at wilL The 
next Meditation is headed X^est pas Gourmand 
qui vent, and begins as follows : — 

** Th€re are individoak to whom natnie has denied a 
refinerm^nt of organs, or a cootinnltv of attention, without 
which the most succolent dishes pass unobsared. Physi- 
ology has already recognised the first of these varieties, by 
ftiiowing US the tongue of these nnfortmiates, badly pro- 
vi*l<;d with nerves for inhaling and appreciating flavours.

traitfff chatterboxes, persons engaged in business, the 
ambitimw, and others, who seek to occupy themselves with 
two things at once, and eat only to be filled. Such, for 
JnHtance, was Napoleon ; he was irregular in his me^ 
and ate fast and ill ; but there again was to be traced 
that absolute will which he carried into ever}'thing bfe

that it should be satisfied, and his establisbment was so 
arranged tiiat in all places, and at all hours, chicken, 
cutlets, and coffee, might be forthcoming at a word.*— 
vol. i. p. 252. 

The habit of eating fast and carelessly is suppoficd 
* to have paralysed Napoleon on two of the most cri- 
tical occasions of his life — the battles of Borodino 
and Leipsic. On each of these occasions he is known 
to have been suffering firom indigestion. On the 
third day of Dresden, too, (as the Gernaan novelist, 
Hoffinan, who was in the town, asserts) the Em- 
peror's energies were impaired by the effects of a 
shoulder of mutton stuffed with onions. 

There can be no doubt that Napoleon's irregu- 
larity as to meals injured his health and shortened 
his life. The general order to his household was 
to have cutlets and roast chicken ready at all hours, 
night and day, and it was observed to the letter 
by his moMre (fA^?, .Dunand, who had been a 
celebrated cook. In his more dignified capacity, he 
contrived to fall in with the humours of his Im- 
perial master, and, by so doing, to be of essential 
use at critical emergencies, when an hour of pro- 
IcHiged flurry or iritation might have cost a province 
or a throne. On one occasion, when matters had 
gone wrong in some quarter. Napoleon returned from 
the CoHseil cCUtat in one of his worst tempers and 
most discontented moods. A dejeuner h lafowrcheite^ 
bomprising his favourite dishes, was served up, and 
Napoleon, who had fasted since daybreak, t<»L V^

Wlicther Napoleon was a hero to his valet de 
ehambre we will not pretend to say, but he was 
certainly a hero to his maitre d^h&td. 

An occupied man, who values his healdi and 
wishes to keep his physical powers and mental 
energies unimpaired, should sedulously eschew busi- 
ness, as well as agitating or anxious topics of all 
kinds, whilst the digestive organs are at work. 
When M. de Suffrein was conunanding for the 
French in the East, he was one day waited upon by 
a deputation of natives, who requested an audience 
just as he was sitting down to dinner. He desired 
an aide-de-camp to inform them that it was a precept 
of tlic Christian religion, from which no earthly con- 
tfideration vrovld induce him to dsipsi^., xkaN^x to

iattend to btisiness of any sort at dinner-time ; and 
the deputation departed, lost in admiration- at the 
piety of the Commandant. To dine alone is neither 
wholesome nor agreeable. To solitary diners may 
■■ be applied the fine lines of Groldsmith : — 

" Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy, 
' ' To fill the languid pause with finer joy." 

Better, indeed, far better, to rank with the class 
described by Byron, which, by the way, may some- 
times include a connoisseur, — 

M ' *i Who think less of good eating than the whisper, 
When seated near them, of some pretty lisper." 

But what a deceased clerical wit called *' flashes 
of silence " may occasionally intervene. We were 
once dining with the author of ' Vanity Fair ' at 
the JRocher, when a matelotte of surpassing excel- 
lence was served up. " My dear fellow," exclaimed 
the distinguished moralist, "don't let us speak a 
word till we have finished this dish." He is not 
less eminent as a dinner-giver than as a dinerout, 
and conceives himself to have discovered that a 
slight infusion of crab is a decided improvement to 
cuny. This reminds us of an anecdote related of a 
deceased Irish nobleman, who had expended a lajfge 
fortune in (as he said) the cause of his country. 
When djring, he summoned his heir to his- bed- 
ride, and=told him he had a secret to communicate

unworthy of tbe honours of the sitting and the pleagnreiv 
attached to it." 

A distinguished gastronomer, lefining on this 
invention, proposes ^prouvettes by negation. When, 
for example, a dish of high merit is suddenly de- 
stroyed by accident, or any other sudden disappoint- 
ment occurs, you are to note the expression of your 
guests' £ices, and thus form your estimate of their 
gastric sensibilities. We will illustrate this matter 
by an anecdote. Cardinal Fesch, a name of honour 
in the annals of gastronomy, had invited a lai^ 
pfuiy of clerical magnates to dinner. By a for- 
tunate coincidence, two turbots of singular beauty 
amved as presents to his Eminence on the very 
morning of the feast. To serve both would have 
appeared ridiculous, but the Cardinal was most 
anxious to have the credit of both. He imparted 
his embarrassment to his chef. " Be of good fidth, 
your Eminence," was the reply ; " both shall appear ; 
both shall enjoy the reception which is their due." 
The dinner was served : one of the turbots relieved 
the soup. Delight was in every face — it was the 
moment of the ipraaryette positive. The maUre 
d^Mtel advances; two attendants raise the turbot 
and carry him off to cut him up ; but one of them 
loses his equilibrium : the attendants and the turbot 
roll together on the floor. At this sad sight the 
assembled Cardinals became pale as death, and a 
solemn silence reigned in the conclave — it was th^ 
moment ot the iprouveite tiegati'oe *, \sv>X» ^^ w-wIt^^

on women, also, should not be received with implicit 
ac^iuiesccnce. Mrs. Glasse's book was written by Df. 
Hunter ; but Mrs. Eundell's was her own, and is cer- 
tainly not devoid of merit, although hardly equal to 
Ud<J*H, Soycr's, or Francatelli's more amHtious pro- 
ductions. In our humble opinion, too, women make 
far the best English cooks, practically speaking; and 



COMPARATIVE MERITS OF FEMALE COOKS. 67 

the fair sex have supplied some tolerably apt pupils 
to the French school; but they seldom arrive at 
distinguished proficiency imless they are both hand- 
some and coquettes — for the simple reason that no 
Frenchman who aiFects taste will take pains to teach 
a woman who is not able and willing to minister to 
the gratification of his vanity. 

It may consequently turn out no great hardship 
after all to be obliged to follow the advice given in 
the New Almanach des Gourmands (of 1830) : "Si 
les gages d'un cuisinier, et surtout les habitudes 
de I'artiste, vous le rendent trop dispendieux, 
bomez-vous au cordonAyleu, Faites choix d'lme 
cumni^e active, propre," &c. This passage may 
suffice to refute the common error of supposing 
that cordon-bleu means a first-rate artist of either 
sex. In gastronomic language, the term is exclu- 
sively applicable to females, and the original cause 
of its being so applied was an involuntary and en- 
thusiastic recognition of female merit by Louis XV. 
The confirmed opinion of this royal voluptuary was, 
that it was morally and physically impossible for 
a woman to attain the highest pitch of perfection 
in the culinary art. Madame Dubarry, piqued 
by his frequent recurrence to this invidious theory, 
resolved to bring him over to a way of thinking 
more complimentary to her sex. She accordingly 
sought out the best cuiainiere that France could 
produce, and gave her the minutest private in- 
structions as to his Majeaty'^ feuNovsx^Xfc ^i:^^^ "^^

There was probably nothing which the King 
(or the lady) would not have granted at such a 
moment, but the name of this cuisiniere was unfor- 
tunately not inscribed in the register of the Order, 
and she has thus been cheated of her immortality. 

There is no part of the world in which the con- 
noisseur may not find some delicacy peculiar to the 
place — as the turkey, fattened on the olives of Mount 
Hymettus, at Athens ; the famous minestra del riso, 
at Milan ; the pesce reale (royal fish), at Naples ; the 
ombre chevalier (a large species of char), of the Lake 
of Geneva; the red trout of the lake near Andemach; 
the crawfish fix)m the Rhine, or the thrushes from 
the Ehenish vineyards ; the pM de chamois, on the 
Simplon ; the white truffles of Piedmont ; the wild 
boar, at Eome ; the coquille d^^crevisse, at Vaucluse ; 
the ortolan and beccajico of the South of Europe, 
&c. &c. — for the list might be indefinitely extended. 
Yet, to the best of our information and experience, 
whenetrer a dish attracts attention by the art dis- 
played in its conception or preparation apart from 
the material, the artist will commonly be discovered 
to be French. Many years ago we had the curiosity 
to inquire, at the Hotel de France at Dresden, to 
whom our party were indebted for the enjoyment

hotel were one and the same person— a Frenchman, 
ei-devant chef of a Bussian minister. He had been 
eighteen years in Germany, but knew not a word of 
any language but his own* "-4. quoi bon, Messieurs, " 
was his reply to our expression of astonishment; 
*' h quoi bon apprendre la langue d^un peuple qui 
" ne posshde pas une cuisine ?" 
. The same cannot be affirmed of England, much 
as we may be indebted to our neighbours across the 
Channel in this respect. It is allowed by competent 
judges that a first-rate dinner in England is out of 
all comparison better than a dinner of the same class 
in any other coimtry ; for we get the best cooks, as 
we get the best singers and dancers, by bidding 
highest for them, and we have cultivated certain 
national dishes to a point which makes them the 
envy of the world. In proof of this bold assertion, 
which is backed, moreover, by the unqualified ad- 
mission of Ude,* we request attention to the menu 
of the dinner given to Lord Chesterfield, on his 
quitting the office of Master of the Buckhounds, at 
the Clarendon. The party consisted of thirty; the 
price was six guineas a-head; and the dinner was 
ordered by Count d'Orsay, who stands almost without 
a rival amongst connoisseurs in this department of 
art :- —

FAMOUS COOKS.., :v 73 



Ghevassut, Goubeaud, and Huggins, weie famous in 
their time, and formed the eminent culinary brigade 
of Carlton House ; Courroux, Honore, Menil, Morel 
Senior, Barge, House, Cotton, Mills, Sams, Oudot 
senior. Farmer, Pratt, and Dick Wood, were first- 
rafce cooks. Honore was many years cook to the 
late Lord Holland and to the late Marchioness of 
Hertford. Florence, cook to successive Dukes of 
Buccleuch, is immortalised by Scott, as inventor 
of the potage a la Meg Merrilies, Farmer, for many 
years cook to the late Earl of Bathursi, is said to have 
been the very first English artist of his day. Pratt 
was head cook to his late E. H. the Duke of York. 

At the head of the celebrities here enumerated, 
we must not forget to place Louis Eustache Ude. 
For upwards of twenty years he had the honour 
of educating the palate of the late Earl of Sefton, 
who, in his day, was considered a great gourmet 
as well as a great gourmand — and, be it under- 
stood, these qualifications are seldom united. The 
difference between a gourmet and a gourmand we 
take to be this : a gourmet is he who selects, for his 
nice and learned delectation, the most choice deli- 
cacies, prepared in the most scientific manner; 
whereas, the gourmand bears a closer analogy to 
that class of great eaters illnaturedly (we dare say) 
denominated or classed with aldermen. Ude was 
also once maUre d'kotel to the late Duke of York, 
firom whom he contrived to elicit many a hearty 
laugh through his clever; ; mimicry. Under his 
auspices, also, it was t\A\. '' \5c^^'^<^X^'«^^^i^^ "^^

destructive career. 

Imub Enstache Ude was Terily the Gnl Bias de 
la cvimu. He had, in his latter days, a notion of 
writing his memoirs ; and if they had not proved 
deeply interesting, those who knew him well can 
with truth assert that many would have relished the 
curious scandal and pleasant gossip with which his 
astonishing memoiy was so well st(»ed. Ude's 
mamma was an attractive and livelv milliner, who 
married an underling in Louis XVI.'s kitchen. She 
thought Master Eustache too pretty a boy to be sacri- 
ficed to the " Dieu ventru" The consequence was, 
that after an attempt made by his sire to train him 
in his own ** glorious path " the youngster absconded, 
and apprenticed himself, first to a ^* bijoutier en 
faux^^ then to an engraver, next to a printer, and 
lastly to a haberdasher ! after which he became tra- 
veller for a mercantile house at Lyons. Something 
occurred at this point which occasioned him to 
change his vocation once more. He returned to 
Paris, and there tried his genius as an actor at a 
small theatre in the Bue Chantreine. He {Soon, 
however (aided by a discriminating public), dis- 
covered that his share of the world's cake was not 
on that stage, and, by some means, he set up an 
office and a ** cahriolet,^^ and forthwith started into 
life as an *' agent de ehinge^^ This scheme did not 
last long ; he got ^' cleaned out " on 'Change, and 
shortly after was installed as an inspector df gam-

uid, on lelinqiufihiiig it, determined to letum to his 
original calling, and became once again % cook. 
•^ After practising in the culinary profession some 
^few years in the eariy dawn of the fortimes of the 
llKmse of Bonaparte, Ude raised himself to the post 
of maitre dliotel to Madame Letitia Bonaparte. 
Here our artist remained for about two years, when, 
-aintig to some difference of opinion between Ma- 
-dame Letitia and himself in matters arithmetical, 
he somewhat suddenly left that lady's service to 
honour our land with his presence ; and ever after, 
when fitting opportunity presented itself, he was 
wont to express his indignation against the '^ iisur- 
pateur " and all his family. Good cooks were scarce 
in England in those days, and, shortly after his 
arrival, the late Earl of Sefton secured his services 
at a salary of 300 guineas per annum ; and not only 
proved himself a liberal and kind-hearted patron 
during his lifetime, but, with that benevolence for 
which he was remarkable, handsomely provided for 
the old age of his favourite cook by leaving him 
100/. for life. 

On Ude's retirement firom the active duties of his 
high vocation at Crockford's, his mantle fell on 
Chades Elme Francatelli — an author of merit, and a 
man of cultivation and accomplishments, as well as 
an eminently distinguished artist. His treatise on 
Gastronomy, published by Bentley, were alone suffi- 
oient to place him in the front r^ik of the scientific 
professors of the art. He was many years chef at

can thejr be fidrly made responsible for the heart* 
breaking humiliaticm and injustice that may be per- 
petrated by their authority ? At the end of two years 
Francatelli was displaced, or reluctantly resigned, 
the victim (he doubtless believes) of some pantry, 
scullery, still-room, or stewardVroom cabal, and the 
Coventry Club was fortunate enough to possess him 
fcr a period. At present, if we are not misinformed, 
he is in the full enjoyment of the ctium cum digni- 
tatCf and of a handscHne competence to boot — a cir* 
cumstance at which we should rejoice more cordially, 
did it not militate very seriously against the grati-- 
fioation of our palates.

genius and inexhaustible resonice; but his execu- 
ti(»L is haidlj on a par with his conception, and he 
is more likely to earn his immortality by his soup- 
kitchen than by his soup. 

The most eminent cooks of the present time in 
England are Pierre Moret, of the Royal Household ; 
Aberlin, chef to the Duke of Devonshire ; Crepin, 
of the Duchess of Sutherland's household; Dunand, 
Paiaire, Gerin, Mesmer; Labalme, cook to the Duke 
of Beaufort ; Bony, cook to the Duke of Buccleuch ; 
Auguste Halinger, cook to Baron de Rothschild ; the 
brothers Mailliez; Brtknet, cook to the Duke of 
Montrose; Lambert, to Mr. Charles Townley; 
Valentine, to Lord Poltimore ; Hopwood, to Lord 
Foley; George Perkis, to the Marquis of Bristd; 
Louis Besnard, to Mr. Mazse ; Frottier, to the Duke 
of Cambridge ; Peren, to the Marquis of London- 
derry; Bernard, to Lord Willoughby d'Eresby; 
Ghierault, to Mr. H. T. Hope ; Chaudeau, to the 
Marquis of Lansdowne; Eotival, to Lord Wilton; 
Douetil, to the Duke of Cleveland ; Palanque, to the 
Carlton Club ; and Comte, to Brookes's. Paul Pas- 
quier, Alphonse Gouffe, and Fouillois are the .first 
pdtissiera of the day. Perugini, Raffielle, Vincent, 
and Mauditt are the first confectioners. 

The present Duke of Beaufort had a Neapolitan 
confectioner, who was thoroughly impressed with the 
dignity, and imbued with the spirit, of his art. His 
Gmace was one night in bed, and fast asleep, when 
he was roused by a knock at his door, which was 
impatiently repeated. He asked who was there.

*'Itis only me, Signor Due," said the artist; "I 
was at tjie Opera, and I have been dreaming of the 
miisic. It was Donizetti's, and I have got an idea. 
I have this instant invented a sorbet ; I have named 
it after that divine composer, and I hastened to 
inform your Grace." This is ahnost as good as 
Herbault's reply to Lady D., when she remonstrated 
with him about the price of a turban : — *' Madame,, 
parole d'honneur, il m'a coute trois nuits d'insomnie 
seulement pour Timaginer." 

Young men rising into reputation are : Mortiere, 
cook to Lord Hardwicke ; Dubois ; Sevestre, to the 
Duchess of Gloucester; Montoy, to Lord Castle- 
reagh ; Charles Lion, to Lord Ernest Bruce ; 
Denise, Tessier, Carta], Debille, Amato, George 
White, George Tredway, Filippo Betti. 

It is a curious fact that almost all the great artists 
in this line are erratic, restless, and inconstant. 
They seldom stay long with the same employer, be 
he as liberal, indulgent, and discriminating as he 
may. Is it that they sigh, like the Macedonian, 
for new worlds to conquer, or that — extending the 
princij^le of the German Wanderjdhr to the whole 
of human life — they fancy that knowledge and in- 
tellect are cramped and restricted by becoming 
stationary? The phenomenon well merits the 
serious attention of the metaphysician. 

We are now arrived at the conclusion of our^ 
sketch o{ the history and present state of cookery, 
and have only a single cautioHfirfy tStiaei^iVtiQ; \]d^&! 



waiter's * ORIGINAL.' 7^ 

Without appliances and means to boot, it is madness 
to attempt entrees and entremets; and " better first 
in a village than second in Eome" is a maxim pecu- 
liarly applicable to cookery. " A good soup, a small 
turbot, a neck of venison, ducklings with green peas, 
or chicken with asparagus, and an apricot tart, is a 
dinner for an emperor.*' So said the late Earl of 
Dudley; and such a dinner can be better served in 
England than in any other — or, more correctly 
speaking, there is no other country in the world 
where it could be served at all. But before proceed- 
ing to illustrate the advantages of the simple style 
of dinner-giving when the Amphitryon does not 
happen to be a millionaire, we must pay a well- 
merited tribute to the memory of the man who did 
for it almost as much as Brillat de Savarin effected 
for the more composite style amongst the French. 
We allude to the late Thomas Walker, formerly one 
of the police magistrates of the metropolis, and author 
of ' The Original.' This remarkable publication ap- 
peared in weeUy numbers, beginning May 20th, 
1835, and was continued till the commencement of 
the following year, when the series was abruptly dis- 
continued by the lamented death of the writer. To 
enable our readers to estimate his weight as an au- 
thority on dinner-giving, we shall begin by bringing 
together a few of the quaint and amusing reminis- 
cences he has printed of himself. The following are 
prefixed, by way of introduction, to a series of papers 
' On the Art of attaining high Health,' which com- 
meiice w^th tbe ttiid uuecJd^ ^i \5i^^ ^oSs^"* —

*' Darii^ iheae jean (he k speaking of his early youth) 
and for a loDg time afttsr, I felt no security of mj health. 
At last) one day when I had shut myself up in the country, 
and was reading with great attention Cicero's treatise 
* De Oratore,' some passage — I quite forget what — sug- 
gested to me the expediency of making the improvement 
of my health my study. / rose from my hook, stood holt 
upright, and determined to he toeU. In pursuance of my re- 
solution I tried many extremes, was guilty of many absurd- 
ities, and committed many errors, amidst the remonstnmc^B 
and ridicule of those around me. I persevered, nevertfa^ 
less, and it is now, I believe, full sixteen years since I hate 
had any medical advice, or taken any medicine, or anythiag 
whatever by way of medicine. During that period I have 
lived constantly in the world — ^for Ihe last six years in 
London, without ever being absent during any one whoJo 
week — and I have never foregone a single engagement of 
business or pleasure, or beeil confined an hour, with the 
exception of two days in the country from over exertiozu 
For nine years I have worn neither great-coat nor cloak, 
though I ride and walk at all hours and in all weathers. 
My dress has been the same in summer and winter, n^ 
U7id(?r garments heing single and oiQy of cotton, and I am 
always light shod. The only inconvenience I sufier is 
occasionally from colds ; hut with a lUtle more cars I could 
entirely prevent them ; or, if I took the trouble, Icotdd remove 
the most severe infour-and-twenty hours'* 

The time and manner of his determination to be 

well strongly resemble Major Longbow*s no less 

strenuous determination on board the steamer, that 

no human consideration should induce him to be 

sick; and from his power of preventing or rapidly 

Temoving colds, we should suppose Ifix.'^^iSkKt Tft*

lated to tlie Maiquis of Snowdaa, immartfOiiled by 
Mr. Hook in * Love and Pride/ who soouta, as a 
reflection on his nobility, the bare supposition that a 
Plinlimmon could catch cold. But it is unnecessary 
to resort to fiction for instances of the exemption 
obtained by great men, apparently by mere dint of 
Tolition, from the ordinary wants and weaknesses of 
humanity. The Duke of Wellington is said to have 
been enabled to sustain the extraordinary fatigues of 
the late war in the Peninsula by the acquired habit 
of snatching sleep at any period of the day or night 
iadiflerently. Lord Brougham's capacity for intel- 
lectual exertion on a corresponding scale is, in part, 
owing to the same habit. We are the more particidar 
in our enumeration of instances, to prepare the reader 
for the still more startling assertion of personal privi- 
l^e or exemption which comes next. Our author is 
describing the residts of an abstemious diet : — 

*' Indeed, I felt a different being, light and vigorous, 
with all my senses sharpened — I enjoyed an absolute 
glowmg existence. I cannot help mentioning two or three 
instances in proof of my state, though I dare say they will 
appear almost ridiculous, but they are nevertheless true. 
It seems that from the surface of an animal in perfect 
healtii there is an active exhalation going on which repels 
impurity ; for when I walked on the dustiest roads, rwt onli/ 
my feety bitt even my stockings, remained free from dust. 
By way of experiment, I did not wash my face for a weeh^ 
nor did any ofne see, nor I feel, the difference/* 

Yet even these things may be paralleled from the 
memoira of a hero of iea2L Yvfe, ^Vc> t^^sc^j^^^^^^^^-

Mr. Walker end?avoiiiing, in a sobseqoent number,

It is needless to repeat Lady Mary Wortley Mon- 
tagu's remark on a French lady's expressing some 
astonishment at the not quite spotless condition of 
her hands. Miss Berry, in her clever and agreeable 
hook on the Social Life of England and Fran^, 
quotes this reply in illustration of the coarseness of 
the times ; but the inference is hardly just, for, as- 
suming Lady Mary to have been acting on Mr, 
-Walker's theory, her frank avowal was simply tan- 
tamount to saying that she was ill. At the same time, 
in case of confirmed ill health, it might be advisaUe 
to try the effect of an occaaional ablution iiistead of 
trusting to '* active exhalation " exclusively. J^i".

r '* According to the lexicons, the Greek for £nner is 
Ahston, and therefore, for the convenience of the terms, and 
without entering into any inquiry critical or antiquarian, I 
call tJhe art of dining, caristologi/, and those who study it, 
dir^&ologists. The maxim that practice makes perfect does 
riot ajiply to our daily habits j for, so &r as they are con- 
cerned, we are ordinarily content with the standard of 
meddocrfty or something rather below. Where study is 
not absolutely necessary, it is by most people altogether 
dispensed with, but it is only by an union of study and 
practice that we can attain anything like perfection. Ant/' 
body can dine, hut very few know hew to dine so as to ensure 
the greatest quantity of health and enjoyment. Indeed, many 
people contrive to destroy their health ; and, as to enjoy- 
mi^ti^I shudder lyheci I think^how oflen I have been

Sfijb ijn durance ^^tely to go through the ceremony of din-

how o/tenin this land of liberty I have felt myself a slave! 

" There are £hree kinds of dinners — solitary dinners, 
evel7-(5ay social dSiiriers, and s6t dinners; all three involv-

also. Solitary dinners, I think, ought to be avold^^ ^s^

'^ %ere is in thf» art of dining a matter of special mih 
portance — I mean attendance— the real end of whjch is to 
do that for. you which you cannot so well do for yourself. 
Uufortunfltely^ this end is generally lost sight of, and the 
effect of attendance is to prevent you from doing tLat which 
you could do much better for yourself. The cause of this 
perversion is to be found in the practice and example of the 
rich and ostentatious, who constantly keep up a sort of war- 
^^tabfehmeht, or ' establishment adapted to extraordinaiy 
instead of ordinary occasions ; and the consequence is, that, 
lik^ all potentates who follow the same policy, they never 
really taste the sweets of peaces — they are in a constant 
Matebf invajBion by their own troOps.^ I am rather a bold 
man at table, and set form vepry much at defiance, so thati, 
if a salad happens to be within my reach, I make no scruple 
to take it to me ; but the moment t am espied, it Is hipped 
pp from the most convenient to the most inconvenient posi- 
tion, lliat such absurdity should exist among rational 
jbeings, and in a civilised country, is extraordinary ! See k 
small party with a dish of fish at each end of the table, 
and four silver covers unmeaningly starving at the sides, 
whilst everythmg pertaining to the fish comes, even with 
th^ he^t attendance, provokingly lagging, one thing after 
another, so tnat contentment is out of the question ; and all 
this d.one under pretence that it is the most convenient plan ! 
This is an utter fallacy. The only convenient plan is to 
Jhave everything actually upon the table that is wanted at 
the samef tinie, apd nothing else; as, for example, for a 
party of eight,' turooi and salmon, with doubtes c^C oasfc^ <^^

^If, and which we enjoyed very much, It consiste(^pf 
crimped cod, woodcocks, and plum-pudding, just as n^uch 
of each as we wanted, and accompanied by champagne. 
Now this dinner was both very agreeable and very whole- 
some, from its moderation ; but the ordinary course would 
havie been to have preceded the woodcocks by some sub- 
stantial dish, thereby taking kway from their relish, at the 
same time overloading the appetite.' Delicacies are scarcely 
=e\'er brought till liiey are ' quite superfluous, which is uu- 
satisfadtoiy if they are not eaten, and pernicious if tbdy 



are." 



TM^ is a good plan enough when you are well 
axjquaiiited with your guests' appetites, and know 
that they will be ^tisfied with a woodcock a- 
piece; but .we have seen eaters who would expe- 
rience veiy^ little difficulty in despatching single- 
handed th^ dinner ordered by Mr. Walker for three.

96 THE ART OF DINING. 

ate a Solan goose, fi>r a whet, and ieel like Um 
afltonislied if his appetite was not sharpened by the 
cifcomstanoe. Most people must have seen or heard 
of a cfoicatnie repres en ting a man at dinner upon 
a ronnd of beef, with the landlord looking on, — 
" Capital beef, landlord," says the gentleman, ** a man 
may cnt and come again here." " You may cut. 
Sir,*' responds Boniface ; "but I'll be blowed if you 
shall come again." The person represented was the 
nobleman in question ; and the sketch was founded 
upon &ct. He had occasion to stay late in the citjr, 
and turned into the celebrated Old Bailey beef-shop 
on his return, where, according to the landlord's 
computation, he demolished about seven pounds aiod 
a half of solid meat, with a proportionate allowance 
of greens. The exploits of a well-known literary 
and political character at Crockford's were such, 
that the founder of that singular institution more 
than once had serious thoughts of offering him a 
guinea to sup elsewhere, and was only prevented by 
the fear of meeting with a rebuff similar to that men- 
tioned in * Roderick Eandom ' as received by the 
master of an ordinary, who, on proposing to buy off 
an ugly customer, was informed by him that he had 
been alre&dy bought off by aU the other ordinaries in 
town, and was consequently under the absolute 
necessity of continuing to patronise the establish- 
ment. 

Another unanswerable objection to the above dinner 

is its palpable want of harmony with the season.

T^aj^g^bles are made to figure in a tery secondary wi^,

"ftrhich- i^ ^generally before they are at l^e best; and then, 
tiKe other delicacies, they are introduced after the appetite

potatoes, smoking hot, and accompanied by melted butter 
of the first quality, would alone stamp merit on any dinner; 
but Aey are as rare on state occasions, so served, as If tiiey 
were of the cost of pearls." 

The remark of a late Q.C. and M.P, on the late 
Baron Hullock was — " He was a good man, an ex- 
cellent man. He had the best melted butter I ever 
tasted in my life.** A distinguished connoisseur, 
still spared to the world, contends that the moral 
qualities of a hoetess may in like manner be tested 
by the potatoes. iPhe importance attached by ano- 
ther equally imimpeachable authority to the point, 
was sufficiently shown by what took place at the 
meeting of a club-committee specially caUftlfeL^lsNSi,

98 THE 4irr of coong. 

li^liTTiAn from the Albion, and a Frenchman lecooih 
xnended by Ude ; the eminent divine to whom we 
allude was deputed to examine them, and the first 
question he pat toeach was, — ^*Oan you bml apotato?^ 
We have already given two of Mr. Walker's prac- 
tical illustrations. We now come to a third, which 
will be found equally replete with interest : — 

^' In entertaming those who are in a di£^nt dass from 
ourselves, it is expedient to provide for them what they are 
not used to — and that which we are most in the war of 
procnring of superior quality. Many people, fix)m Hieir 
connexion with foreign countries, or with different parts 
of their own, are enabled to command with ease to 
themselves what are interesting rarities to others ; and one 
sure way to entertain with effect is, to cultivate a good 
mnierstanding with those with whom we deal for the sup^ 
ply of the table. By way of illustration of what I have ■ 
said on the subject of choice plain dinners, I will give m 
account of one I once gave in the chambers of a fi-iend df 
mine in the Temple to a party of six — all of whom were 
accustomed to good living, and one of whom was bred ki 
one of the most celebrated tables in London. The dinner 
consisted of the following dishes, served in successioii, and, 
with their respective adjuncts, carefully attendfed to. I^'ifttj 
spring soup from Birch's on Comhlll, which," to liiose WHi} 
have never lasted it, I particularly recommend in the i^easbtf 
as being quite delicious; then a- moderate-Sizdd ttittte,

tile drambtts wss conneoted witii the city, and he tinder^ 
took spedaily to order the difierent articles, which it wotdd 
haye been impossible to exceed in quality ; and, though the 
^hand beef were dressed by a Temple laundress, th£gr 
could DQt have bef A better served, I suppose principally 
^om the kitchen being dose at hand and her attention not 
being distracted. And here I must remark that the proxir 
mity of the kitchen was not the least annoyance to us in 
any way, or indeed perceptible, except in the excellence of 
the sevving up. The beef deservedly noet with the highest 
praise ; and certainly I never saw even venison more en- 
joyed. The crab was considered particularly well intro- 
duced, and was eaten with peculiar zest; and the simpUcity 
of the jelly met with approval. The dessert, I think, con- 
sisted only of oranges and biscuits, followed by occasional 
introductions of anchovy toast. The wines were champagne, 
port, and claret. I have had much experience in the diiv- 
ner way, both at large and at small parties, but I never saw 
such a vividness of conviviality either at or afber dinner ; 
which I attribute principally to the real object of a dinner 
being the only one studied ; state, ornament, and superfluity 
bluing, utterly excluded. I hold this up as an example of 
the plain^ easy style of entertaining.

positions in faA^our of compactness of dining-room, of proaur 
mity of kitchen,, of smallness of party, of absence of state

inimitable. The Dublin haddock is another delicacj

feur-pence a pie«e; but he has been known to 
giTc two guinea? for one T^ghing a pound and a 
half. His Grace's custom was to put all the liven 
togetlier into a butter-boat, to aroid the chances c£ 
inequality; very properly considering that, to be 
helped to a mullet in the condition of an East Indian 
nabob, would be too severe a shock for the netves 
or spirits of anj man. The mullet have now neady 
deserted W^Tnouth fi>r the coast of Cornwall, whithdr 
we recommend the counoisseur to repair in the dc^- 
dajs, takiDg care to pay his respects to the doiias 
of Plymouth on the way, — and he will have Ae 
pleasure of following the example of Quin. London, 
however, is now tolerably well supplied with mullet 
from Hastings. There are epicures who combine 
these luxuries, eating the flesh of the dory with the 
liver of the mullet ; but though the flesh <£ the 
mullet be poor, it is exactly adapted to the sauce 
which nature has provided for it, and we conse- 
quently denounce all combinations of this description, 
as heterodox. The Brighton dories are also very 
fine, and the Jersey mullet are splendid, weighing 
often three or four pounds a-piece. 

We shall next set down a few specialities regard-

A similar anecdote is current touching wheateaES, 
which, in our opinion, are a greater delicacy. A 
Scotch oflicer was dining with the late Load Greoige 
Lennox, then ewnmandant at Portsmouth, and wis 
jdaced near a dish of wheatears, which was rapidly dis- 
appearing under his repeated attacks. Lady Louisa 
Lennox tried to divert his attenticm to another dish. 
"l?a, na, my leddy," was the reply, "these wee 
birdies will do verra weel.^ We have heard that some 
canvas-back ducks, sent by Mr. Piescott the his- 
torian to an English friend, were accidentally for- 
waided to Melton, and eaten by a select party as 
cr>mm<^in ducks. Due honour, however, was paid to 
a similar present from the same illustrious quarter at

these tender victims. We read of pigs whipped to death with 
som^rfthiug of a shock, as we hear of anj other obsolete cus- 
tom. The age of discipline is g*?ue bv, or it would be 
'.-arioas to iuquire (in a philosophical light merely) what 
effect this process might have towards infcenerating aiid 
dulcifying a substance naturally so mild and dulcet as the 
Hesh of young pigs. It looks like refining a violet Yet we 
-should be cautious, while we condemn the inhumanity^ 
how we censure tht; wisdom of the practice. It might im- 
part a gusto. 

*' I remember an hypothesis aigued apoD by the yomig 
students when I was at St. Omer's, and maintained widi 
much learning and pleasantry on both sides, ' whether 
supposing that the flavour of a pig who obtained his death 
Irtv whij)ping (jper flageUationem extremam) superadded a 
]jloasure upon the palate of a man more intense than any 
f)Os.sible suffering we can conceive in the animal, is man 
justified in using that method of ])ntting the animal to 
death ?' I forget the decision."* 

A true gastronome is as insensible to suffering as 
a conqueror. Ude discourses thus on the skinning 
uf eels : — 

" Take one or two live eels ; throw them into the fire ; 
as they are twisting about on all sides, lay hold of them 
with a towel in your hand, and skin them from head to taO. 
This method is the best, as it is the only method of draw- 
ing out all the oil, which is unpalatable and indigestible. 
Cut the eel in pieoes without ripping the beUy. then nm 
your knife into the hollow part, and turn it round to take 
i>ut the inside. 

^* Several reviewers " (he adds in a note to his second 
oiYitlon) " have accused me of cruelty because I recommend 

* JUiaMcrUtion on Koait Pig, ' EBsay« oC l&^ias ^'^^ ^iSm. 



BURNINO ASD BKINNINO EELS. 113 

in this work that eels shonld be burDt alive. As my know* 
ledge in cookery is entirely devoted to the gratification of 
taste and the preservation of health, I consider it my duty 
to attend to what is essential to both. The blue skin and 
oil which remain, when the eels are skinned, render them 
highly indigestible. If any of these reviewers would make 
trial of bo^ methods, they would find that the burnt eels 
are much healthier ; but it is, after all, lefl to their choice 
whether to bum or skin." 

The €argumentum ad gulam is here yciy bappily 
applied; but M. Ude might have taken higher 
ground, and urged not merely that the eel was used 
to skinning,* but gloried in it. It was only necessaiy 
for him to endow the eel with the same noble spirit 
of endurance that has been attributed to the goose. 
" To obtain these livers (the foies graa of Stras- 
bourg) of the size required, it is necessary," says a 
writer in the ' Almanach,' *' to sacrifice the person 
of the animal. Crammed with food, deprived of 
innjc, and fixed near a great fire, before whicli it is 
nailed by its feet upon a plank, this goose passes, it 
must be owned, an uncomibrtable life. The torment 
would indeed be altogether intolerable if the idea of 
the lot which awaita him did not serve as a consola- 
tion. But this perspective makes him endure his 
suSerings with courage ; and when he reflects that 

* One of the most important services rendered by Mr. Bentham 
and hi» disciples to the world is a formal refutation of the common 
fallacy as to eela. ** No eel \& used to be skinned successively by 
several persons ; but one and the same person is used. «v3l<u:j»»>vi«^ V-^

Mr. Moiell is a man of cultirateel taste, well read 
in the Phyiioloffie du Gout, and imbued with much 
of its spirit. He knows, and wlQ say at once, 
whether he can supply the genuine article or not. 
The late 5fr. Beckford sent for him one Sunday at 
midday, and set him down to lunch on Westphalia 
ham and SiHeri champagne, desiring him, if they 
turned out to he of first-rate quality, to buy up all 
the hams and wine of the same kind whidi he could 
find on sale. The deciaon was not fevourable^ 
indeed, Mr. Morell is of opinion that Silleri is 
greatly over-estimated in England, and that West- 
phalia hams have deteriorated since the demand for 
them lias increased. He says that the dressing of a 
Kam is one of the most difficult and trying of culinary 
operations, and is seldom well performed except by 
those who have made it their special study. Mr. 
Ford contends that a Montaiiches ham is best holi ; 
but we have somewhere read or heard that a man 
who would eat hot ham, would kill a pig with his 
bwn hand.

128 THE ART OF DINING. 

lated with direct reference to such an end ; for we 
believe the late Lord Holland and Lord Lansdowne 
to have been actuated by a genuine sympathy with 
intellectual excellence, and a praiseworthy desire to 
raise it to that position in society which is its due. 
Our observation applies merely to the eflfects — ^as to 
which, it would appear from their imitative zeal, the 
noble or wealthy leaders of most of the parties, or 
sections of parties, which now divide the political 
world, agree with us. Dinner-giving, in short, has 
become one of the received modes of gaining or ccta- 
ciliating political adherents. Need more be added 
to enhance the dignity and importance of the sub- 
ject, which has been discussed in these pages with 
the more humble object of facilitating convivial en- 
joyment and promoting sociability ?

Itecipefcr Butch Sauce, 

Yolks of two eggs. 
One quarter pint of rich cream. 

Two and a quarter table-spoonfuls of elder-flower vinegar. 
A small quantity of the best fresh butter. 
One blade of mace. 

Flour enough to render the sauoe the ccmsiAtesycj of a 
custard, which it should nearly resemble. 

Becipefor Lobster Sawce, 

m 

The lobster should be chopped much smaller than ordi- 
narily; and the sauce should be composed of three parts 
cream to one of butter, a little salt, and a slight infrisicHi of 
cayenne. The whole of the inside and coral of the lobster 
should be beaten up with the cream and butter, and the 
meat then cut in. 

Sauce for Wild Ducks, roasted, 

1 salt-spoon salt. 

J to } „ cayenne. 

1 dessert-spoon lemon-juice. 

1 „ pounded sugar. 

1 „ ketchup. 

2 „ Harvey. 

3 „ port wine. 

To be well mixed, heated, and poured over the bird, it hav- 
ing been previously sliced, so that the sauce may mix with 
its own gravy. The duck must not be too much roasted, 
and must be put in the dish without anything. 

Salad Sauce, 

Hub with a fork the yolks of two eggs boiled hard, and cold, 
in a salad-bowl, with fresh mustard and a little salt ; four 
table-spoonfuls of oil to one and a half of tam^n, mixing it 
into a cream. Cut in the whites ; six lettuces well blanched ; 
some tarragon, chervil, a few young onions and bumet, and 



APPENDIX. d87 



stir it well. The sauce should be kept in a separate bowl, 
and not be mixed with the salad until the moment before 
it is to be eaten, or it maj lose its crispness and freshness. 

Becipefor a Winter Skdad, by the late Bev, Sydney Smith. 

Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve, 

Unwonted softness to the salad give. 

Of mordent mustard add a single spoon ; 

Distrust the condiment which bites so soon ; 

But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault 

To add a double quantity of salt. 

Three times tiie spoon with oil of Lucca crown. 

And once with vinegar procured from town. 

True flavour needs it, and your poet begs. 

The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. 

Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl. 

And, scarce suspected, animate the whole ; 

And lastly, on the flavoured compound toss 

A magic teaspoon of anchovy sauce. 

Then, though green turtle fail, though venison 's tough. 

And ham and turkey are not boiled enough. 

Serenely full the Epicure may say — 

Fate cannot harm me — I have dined to-day !
