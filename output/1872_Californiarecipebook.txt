PASTRY AHD PIES 



Pastry should be used as soon as made, as it is better 
firesh than after being kept a day or two. 

For a good common pie-crusty allow half a pound of 
shortening to a pound of flour. Pie-crust looks nicer 
made of lard; but tastes better half butter. 

Rub one-half of your shortening, well, with two-thirds 
of your flour, adding a little salt; then add sufficient 
cold water to make it sufficiently moist to roll out; spread 
on the reserve shortening as you roll it out, sprinkling 
on the reserved flour.

Pudding Bags should be made of thick, close 
sheeting to exclude the air. Before using them, 
they should be wrung out in hot water, then thor- 
oughly floured on the inside. In tying, leave room 
to swell. A plate in the bottom of the pot pre- 
vents the bag from burning. Keep the pudding 
covered with water and do not let it stop boiling. 
If necessary, fill up the pot with hot, but never 
cold water.

GAKEIS 



In making cake, accuracy in proportioning the 
ingredients is necessary. The cake should be put 
into the oven as soon as made. The oven being 
already hot, and ready for it. The eggs must be 
fresh and the butter good. 

Do not beat the eggs or butter in tin, as the cold- 
ness of the latter prevents the lightness of the cake. 
To ascertain if the cake is sufficiently done, use a 
straw, if it comes out the least moist, let the cake 
remain in the oven longer.

FLUHMEEY AND PEESEEVES 



Porcelain Kettles should be used for preserves, 
to the exclusion of ail others, and always a wooden 
spoon- It is not economy to use too sparingly of 
sugar, as jellies will not congeal without sufficient 
<sugar, and also when preserves commence to spoil 
they cannot be rendered eatable. Small jars are 
better than large ones, as frequent exposure to the 
air will spoil the fruit. After pouring your pre 
serves into your jars, put several layers of paper 
over the top, pouring over a little brandy.

Valuable Miscellaneous Recipes 

These have been given to ns by our friends, with 
the request that we insert them; as they are origin- 
al and good, we do so with much pleasure. 



TEA. 

Be sure that the water boils. Scald the pot, and put in 
a tea-spoonful for each person. Upon green tea, pour a 
little water, and allow it to stand two or three minutes 
where it will keep hot; then fill the pot from the tea- 
kettle. Green tea should never be boiled, and it is 
rendered dead by being steeped long. 

Of black tea the same measure is used; the pot being 
filled up at first, and set immediately upon coals or a 
stove, just long enough to boil it. Water should be 
added to the tea-pot from the tea-kettle; never fi-om 
the water-pot, as in that case it cannot be boiling hot. 
Black and green tea are good mixed. 
COFFEE. 

Put a large coffee-cupful into a pot that will hold three 
pints of water; add the white of an egg, or a few shav- 
ings of isinglasS; or a well cleansed and ^ried bit of fi^h 



VALUABLE MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 37 

skin of the size of a ten cent piece. Pour upon it boil- 
ing water, and boil it five or six minutes. Then pour a 
gill from the spout, in order to remove it, and pour it 
back into the pot. Let it stand eight or ten minutes, 
where it will keep hot, but not boil; boiling coffee a 
great while makes it strong, but not so lively or agreea- 
ble. If you have no cream, boil a sauce-pan of milk, 
and after pouring it into the pitcher, stir it now and 
then, till the breakfast is ready, that the cream may not 
separate from the milk. Make coffee stronger or weak- 
er, as you prefer, by using a larger or smaller measure 

of ground coffee. 

COFFEE MILK. 

Put a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee into a pint of 
milk; boil it a quarter of an hour with a shaving or two 
of isinglass; then let it stand ten minutes and pour it 
off. 

COMMON MODE OF MAKING CHOCOLATE. 

Shave fine an inch of a cake of chocolate; pour on it a 
quart of boiling water; boil it twenty minutes, add milk 
in such proportion as you like, and boil it up again. 

COCOA. 

Boil two large spoonfuls of ground cocoa in a quart of 
water half an hour; skim off the oil, pour in three gills 
of milk, and boil it up again. It is the best way to 
make it the day before it is used, as the oily substance 
can be more perfectly removed when the cocoa is cold. 

SHELLS. 
Put a heaping teacupful to a quart of boiling water. 
Boil them a great while. Half an hour will do, but two 
or three hours is far better. Scald milk as for coffee. 
If there is not time to boil shells long enough before 
breakfast, it is well to soak them over night and boil 
them in the same water in the morning. 



(MRS. RS. DIRECTIONS.) 

Three pounds of bass, or any white fish; boil till 
tender; then remove the bones; mince it fine; 
season with pepper, salt, juice and part of the rind 
of a lemon, and a little wine^ if you choose. Take 
nearly one quart of milk and slice two onions into 
it, let it boil until the onions are quite soft. Eub 
to a cream two large spoonfuls of flour and nearly 
one- half pound of butter, turn the boiling milk 
through a sieve upon it ; boil again, taking care to 
stir it so that it will not get into lumps. Grate a 
loaf of bread (small baker's loaf). Take the plat- 
ter, it is to be sent to the table on, and put first a 
layer of dressing upon the dish, then fish, repeating 
until the dish is filled as full as you wish, making 
the top dressing. Then put the crumbs of bread 
smoothly on the top, forming an oval in the center- 

Wipe the edge of the platter so that nothing 
shall brown or discolor it. Fill a bread pan with 
water, put the platter on two or three muffin rings. 
Set it into the oven, and let it remain until it is a 
nice brown color, say three quarters of an hour. 
Then place the platter on another and send it to 
the table, garnished with lemon and parsley around 
the dish. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

Cut into little piece3,4 or 5 slices of fat salt pork; fry

^^ CUM FO?- ?OISC)]Srj)AK 

( MRS, A.L.S. BUSH ST.) 

Dissolve 1 ounce of gum-shellac in 6 ounces of 
sulphuric ether; cork tightly in a bottle. Bathe 
the surface, where the irritation or eruption appears, 
with cold water and wipe dry, then apply the above 
solution. The ether will evaporate in one minute, 
leaving an elastic coating of gum, completely im- 
pervious to the air. In about two minutes the most 
distressing case of oak poison can be relieved entire- 
ly of all unpleasant sensations. As the coating 
cracks or peels off, apply more of the solution, and 
in twenty-four hours the case of indescribable suf- 
fering is completely healed. 



TERRAFIM 



( MliS. T. SECOND ST.) 

Three or four are plenty for eight or ten persons. 
Have ready a pot of boiling water, into which you 
have put a teaspoonful of salt for each terrapin. 
Wash the live terrapin in two or three waters, till 
they are perfectly clean. Throw in the boiling water 
and cook till so tender that you can easily pull off 
a leg. Take them out; pull off the top shell, remove 
the sand bag and gall (very carefully). Cut up all 
the rest into small pieces, keeping all to cook except 
the skinny portions and the intestines. Put in a stew 
pan, with cooking sherry (a small tumbler full to each 



VALUABLE MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 45 

terrapin). To every terrapin, allow two ounces of 

butter cut in pieces, and rolled in flour. Season 

with salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Let 

this all come to a boil, then just before serving? 

beat up the yolks of as many eggs as you have 

terrapin, and stir in.

SEWING MACHINE SALES for 1870. 



THE SINGER STILL TRIUMPHANT ! 



Ill 1869 we sold, as our readers will remember, 
86,781 Machines; but we sold last year (1870), 
127,833 (one hundred and twenty-seven thou- 
sand, eight hundred and thirty -three) machines I 
showing an excess beyond the sales of 1869, of 
over forty thousand, and, as shown by the table 
below, over forty-four thousand machines more 
than any other company. 

The reader may naturally ask whether this is 
mere boasting; in answer to which we have to 
say, that those figures, and the ones given below, 
are from sworn returns made by licensees to the 
receiver appointed by the owners of the most 
valuable sewing machine patents, who license 
the companies of lesser importance.
